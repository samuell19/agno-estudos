I was about nine, When my dad gave me a ride on his čezeta for the first time. In the back seat I felt like a king; With his hair in the wind, He was telling me over his shoulder: Sit and hold tight, Everything we want is right in front of us. Sit tight and hold my spine, We’re gonna see places I love! Just a few chords and you’re a king. But when you don’t find them... - Hi, Robin. - Hi. Can’t sleep, huh? I know this. One wants to get all things sorted out before a concert, right... So don’t bother; leave it as it is. Believe me. Many things in life will fix themselves, Robin. I have a gift for you. - Here you are. It’s yours. - Thank you. Izzi’s guitar? Hmm, the most precious one from his collection. And if I can ask you one thing, will you play the gig on it tomorrow? Well, it’s not gonna be a big deal then. A riff has just crossed my mind; can I show it to you? Hmm. Until now my life was like comics. Třinec Ironworks and guys from the band who, like me, want to get into the spotlight. Then Great Britain tour. And finally, we end up in Prague. With a flash disk full of demos, I’ve run around the entire city. And although they were all smash hits, nobody gave a damn about it. Except for Ferdinand Barefoot, alias Michael the Boss. - Dad. - Ok, cheers. Honour work! - Michael the Boss is here. - Another Czech pop legend? Aaah, the big Michael the Boss himself! Doctor, I see you go along well with your hits. - Your agency is doing well, isn’t it? - Well, yes, it is. But sometimes I feel I’m running an old people’s home and not an artistic agency. Take a seat. What do you need? Well, the fans call me all the time. They want to see me on stage again. Are there still some out there? Sorry, sorry... an attempted joke. - Yeah... - Well, and what would you be playing? The same old stuff? No. Listen to these songs. And by the way. I’ve got a lovely duet for Erika and me. Look, let’s get to the point. It’s clear to me you need money. So stop the sweet talk. You have ten minutes to convince me. Erika, sweetie, play the disc for your daddy, please. Life is a fair of worthless trifles, An oasis of deceitful dabblers. You get loge box seats for dump price, No matter whether you bring buddies or your wife. Drivels and nonsense turn into the truth, A shitty coward rewards your talent with slander. Shallow tycoons love their servants... - Smashing, isn’t it? - Hmm. - Michael, shall we take a selfie? - Sure. Did you know that our granny has all your albums? Enough, huh? You see, Michael. Selfies in the home for the elderly will sell like hot cakes. Beda! So I’ll give you a one more chance. He’s yours. And you know what to do. Yeah! Yeah! Cool, guys. We gave our best today! Really! Maybe it was because it was the last time. It’s not worth it, Robin. Apart from a deaf neighbour and some naive fans that Pista had managed to push out, there’s nobody out there knowing us. Come on, don’t be silly. You know how many stars waited for almost twenty years before they made it? In twenty years my d*ck won’t even stand up. Come on, boys. We have a lot of girls, don’t we? Maybe we have girls, but we’re out of pocket for quite a long time now. We owe money almost for breathing the air. The deal was let’s give it a try for one more year and now it’s been almost two years. Look, Robin, we wanted to tell you before, but ... we quit. Are you kidding me? Right now, when we’re just one little step from breaking through? You can’t be serious?! W-wait a little m-moment, just b-because of the w-waitress. You idiot, don’t piss-ss-ss me off! You all piss me off, you assholes. - Robin! - Leave me alone. Fuck you. Yes? Hey kid, I’ve got something for you, but don’t shit your pants from it. Well, yeah, I’m nearly there. And how did you know where I am right now? I’ve made a deal with one producer and we’re gonna make an autumn tour. It’s gonna be my huge comeback and I want you and your band. We plan to rehearse during the summer in camp. Music, girls, and money... you know. Same old things. - Ouch! - What do you think? Shit! What did you say? Damn it, damn it. - So what? - That’s what you said? - You take it or not? - I take it! We take it! ! Yeah! Do you mean it? Michael is now followed by the entire circus. Chorus girls, singer Erika, choreographer Vilma. A night trip across the entire republic back home in the Beskids. Everything he had promised was suddenly here. And we boys were all the more looking forward to returning back home after some time on tour. Gentlemen, we have 15 minutes to go and we’re not waiting for anybody. - Robin? - Bye then/Hi there. Cheers/Hi.. Boys, this is my friend Robin. A former star of our hockey national team. Now a musician. Thanks God. He taught me to play a song with three chords and to this day I pick up girls with it. And now he’s gonna sing to us. Will you, Robin? Sing a song to us. Robin! Robin! Robin! Show them who is the star here. Gentlemen, something for the charity. I still see the eternal struggle with time, when I was nailed to ice, when instead of voice I played with muscle. Then girls stood in rows and I left my modest demands behind. And then strings chained me up and I played even for small money. And I told to myself: ‘And why not’! We’re all musicians; We’re all fullbacks; We’re stars on stage and in ice hockey nets. Beda, can I go with them, please? - Wait, wait....you mean it? - Please... I... Beda. Hockey sticks, hotheads! We’re all musicians; We’re all fighters, So let it all live and let the steam go up! So let it all live; We have dragon’s power! In a year the kids will rush to get a signature from you. But now we are far from being stars, Pista. Well, it was no hitparade. But I’ve never earned so much in five minutes even when I was earning a living as a gigolo in Prague. Pista, boys, let’s go. Come on. We’re on the rise. Let’s go. You see, the youth. Cool. It doesn’t seem to be a good place for shopping. It’s rather shocking. Hi, Beskids! Finally home again. You girls will not miss anything here in the Beskids. Just a smile, common decency and everyone will love to give you a hug. I report to be the first one. Where are the girls in folk costumes to greet us with bread and salt? I couldn’t get a costume, nor bread and salt, but I have a high-quality Miodula drink for greeting. Welcome here. - No! - Yeah. - Cheers then! - Cheers! Slow, slow. This is just a light version for pop fans. You’d have your nails go down after the version for rockers. And there’s a lot of time for this... My name’s Klara. I’m the camp manager and my job is to fulfil your every wish. Really e-every w-wish? That’s g-great, b-because I was just th-thinking about one, Klara sweetie! And... Wh-what’s that? Yeah, wolf. You get lollipops and candy in the sweetshop near the pub. Breakfast is in the dining hall, your accommodation schedule is at the reception and the rest I think you’ll manage yourselves. What the hell is going on there? Well, that’s hardcore. Rockers and Gorals of the world, unite. Forever, and never otherwise. Amen. Well. One party is over and another one seems to be just starting, hm?! The big Michael the Boss himself is here. Haven’t you grown tired of this buffoonery? You know, not everyone wants to stop at the best of times like you. Well, stop... You can break angel’s wings but you can’t wean him off flying. Hi Izzi! - What about your hand? - I’m still alive. Calm down, Izzi. I’ve already given them a children’s portion. You don’t need to kill them the first day. So, may you all have a good time here. And Michael, if you need something, contact Klara. She’s a very smart girl. I’m here just for decoration. So I’m gone. See you later. Dude! It was Izzi! After the motorbike accident the earth swallowed him up. Well, you see, not quite completely. Rock'n’roll lives forever. And then strings chained me up, and I played even for small money. Boys, the yesterday’s video got nearly a thousand views. That means ´ that someone other than us also viewed it. I don’t want to distress you, but I think this is very close to becoming our first hit. Well, I think it’s the shaking hockey sticks at best that’s gonna make it a hit. When we are the musical support. Gentlemen, switch it off. I’m bringing you our first big hit. What? This is our s-second hit already, isn’t it? I don’t want to be and will never be one of you; I’d rather lose and fall down. It’s your fault that the truth has thousands of shades; But I can’t trace the right one. Life is a fair of worthless trifles, An oasis of deceitful dabblers. You get loge box seats for dump price, No matter whether you bring buddies or your wife. What monkey business is this? Why are you playing my song so bad? I’ll tell you something. I took this piece of yours and brushed it up a bit. And it’s a hit. And you’re gonna be famous. But until then, you’re gonna listen to what I tell you and do what I pay you for, buddy. All clear?! Then you can play such a crap by yourself. Nobody will make a fool of me! - Robin, wait. - What’s the matter? A letter from a lawyer. If we don’t pay our rent in a month, they will sue us. Come on. I don’t want to be and will never be one of you. I’d rather lose and fall down. It’s your fault that the truth has thousands of shades; But I can’t trace the right one! I don’t want to be and will never be one of you; I’d rather lose and fall down. It’s your fault that the truth has thousands of shades; But I can’t trace the right one! Great, men. It’s smashing!! This is it, this is it. Also, take a look at the demos. Let’s call it a day today. Tomorrow we’ll continue. It’s gonna be a hit. It’s gonna be ... ... a huge success. Boys, come here. I see you’ve been quite taken by it, haven’t you? Well, to earn a living with music means that you sometimes need to make compromises. Spot on. You’ll find the door to those keys at the river. And I’ll get the drinks. A little bit of rock therapy will make us all good, won’t it? In the mist of darkness, everyone is like you; Muscles soaked in sweat paint. So put up a fight, standing on ground and don’t play it safe! This is our fight, it’s stirring all up This is our fight, fight deep inside us. This is our fight, fight and I must not fail. This is our fight, fight, a journey not a drama! Daddy, you always told me: "If you have talent, son, you can’t resist." "Life is too short for compromises. So do what you can do and what you love to do." May Jesus Christ be praised. Forever, dear pilgrim. I’m Joseph. I’m not saint, but I’m working on it. So tell me. What has exhausted you so much? I was at the cemetery to visit my dad. And I needed to settle my mind. I often do the same, too. I haven’t been to a church for a long time. Hmm, no pause lasts forever. So I hope I’ll see you soon again. May the Lord be with you. Like two islands in the sight of heaven; We sail through universe, thinking of each other. When planets unite us by touch, We will be happier without mortgage debt. How’s the water, beautiful fairy? Wet, my prince. Wet to the bottom. Here under the rock, it’s where only the ill-treated mistresses of the knight Belko swim in the evening. And how did the knight come off? He did. Yes, but how? From the top over there. Right to the ground. Don’t you want to go the same way as the knight Belko? If it is worth it. Good night. - Hi. - What’s up? Sorry to interrupt you, but... My hairdryer broke down. Don’t you have a spare one? I’m gonna have a rehearsal in a while and I need to look great. And a good hairstyle is essential. Look, leave it here. I’ll see what we can do about it. Give it to me. You know, a singer must be perfect all the time anywhere she comes. Just put a peacock feather in your ass and you’ll be perfect, you silly cow. Izzi, hot water is not running in room 2 and we’ve run out of toilet paper. What are you doing? The accounting stuff is driving me nuts. The golden age of rock'n’roll. The producer gave cash on the nail, we gave the show and everyone was happy. What I don’t understand ... What I don’t understand is why I have to explain to somebody why I have purchased ten rolls of toilet paper more than last year. Maybe we’re in more and more shit. Wait, I’ll do the invoices myself. I’ll love you for that. - Hi. - Hi. Hi sweetie, we’ve got a complaint here. In fact, a few more complaints. Sorry tomcat, I can’t now. No, this is unacceptable. Look. Beds are creaking; the doors don’t shut properly, there’s a draught there and the light is not working. Ok, first: It was far bigger stars than us who made the beds creak. And second: I’ll give it a look when I have time. It needs to be fixed immediately. Here’s a screwdriver, you artist, and replace it yourself. Maybe your mind will light up, too. Here you are. Hi. Can I help you? The light bulb? Yeah. I can do the rest myself. Thanks. Will you drop in the club tonight? Izzi said you’re gonna give a gig, so hopefully I will. I’d love to see you there. Bye. I’ll love to see you, too, you musician. This is our fight, it’s stirring all up; This is our fight, fight deep inside us. This is our fight, fight and I must not fail; This is our fight, fight, a journey not a drama! You’re really good and the show is just superb. I’ve not seen Izzi in such a good shape for quite a long time. How long have you been together? I left home when I was fifteen; I never met my father. While sex and drugs – that was my life. And then Izzi appeared. And rock ’n’ roll along with him. The best thing of the deadly trio. I think I love him. Thanks, Izzi. - God bless you, Mayor. - God bless you, Pastor. Don’t forget about the workmen. No worry, I keep that in mind. I’ll call Stephan and tomorrow they will be there on the double quick. Ok. I’m about to leave now, Izzi. God sees everything and maybe you’ll not go to hell. I’ll be glad to see you again in the club, Father. I’ll be glad to see you, too, but in the Mass. It stands to reason. I’d never miss the chance of going there. Besides, your show is one of the few ones that is sold out all the time. I saw stables with horses in the rear. Could I have a ride sometimes? Hey, Beda! How can you call yourself a bodyguard when you don’t even have a gun with you? He doesn’t need one. He himself is a gun. We liked Beda. Despite the fact that he was supposed to look after us. But Pista, as far as women are concerned, was like a loose cannon. Young chorus girls, the experienced choreographer Vilma... nothing mattered. To hell and back in a buggy carriage. I am a fallen angel with a medal on my chest; With the underworld stigma I let all have a good night’s rest. Angel who lived for you as the Antichrist And who is not sure about his own ancestry. I am a fallen angel who wanted you to be mine, And who couldn’t see why there’s no time. Angel who betrayed his conscience because of you And who no longer sheds tears for kisses! Love is a bitch, so is it to beat, or not to beat? If beat is the answer, then with hammer and tongs. Hi, what will you get? One shot, please. Or, three shots straight. Love is a bitch, so is it to beat, or not to beat? If beat is the answer, then with hammer and tongs. Take it easy, Beda. Mind that you discern your sweetheart ...the cutie. Relax guys, it’s just a shirt. Hello, are you Mr. Bedrich Mech? Since time immemorial. Yeah, why? And do you drive a Mustang 12V0161? Correct. What’s up? And where do you park your car? Where do you think? In a garage. Calm down, doctor. I’ll call Stephan and he’ll fix it. It’s ok. Ok, bye. Great. All cops in Prague make fun of the mess you made. Mike, I was totally blotto. I remember nothing. You know I don’t drink and I’m not used to it. Well, of course, I know it. So tell me what happened. What do you think? I was having a good time at one of the parties in the club near the river and ... Wait. What party? What club? Izzi’s club. He sometimes opens it for musicians and friends. A lot of people, great atmosphere. Robin with his band plays there. Great! So the guy won’t stop it, will he? You’ll be happy if the production girls let you do the costume ironing, when you don’t have the license, dude. But important that you have a Bandi suit, you bandit. Beda, Beda, to hell with you. And to hell with Robin. What a fool. - Hello. - Hi. We’ve seen each other at Izzi’s party. You are very good. Thanks. Saturday we have Thai box. Live matches, crowds of people. - Vasek! - Let’s go! Hits, hits! Come on! Pastor and Izzi are awarding prizes. Won’t you come and play? - Hello. - Pastor. Well, why not. If you think people will like that. Under my supervision? I would not accept any other possibility. Not only the soul, but also body must be trained for pitfalls in life. - Ok, agreed. - Fantastic! That evening before we entered the ring, our blood run cold. The camphor inhalation made them look like a cluster of horny mosquitoes. The match for the championship heated up the audience. And we knew that our first big show is right here and right now. Everything was bathed in sunshine. It would never occurred to us that something might go wrong. In the mist of darkness, everyone is like you, muscles soaked in sweat paint. So put up a fight, standing on ground and don’t play it safe! This is our fight, fight and I must not fail; This is our fight, fight, a journey not a drama! I’ve n-never experienced s-such a b-boil. I must say it was quite scary. I’ve never seen so many tattooed muscular men in one place. Scary? After all, the Lord has protected us. Boys, but the girls weren’t bad, were they? These girls are only for bo-bo... Come on, Pista, spit it out. ...Boxers or musicians! Well, you see. Cheers to Pista! To musicians! To us! Well.. Robin, are you going? You know what? I’m sleeping here today. Ok. Let’s go. - Goodnight, buddy. - See you. Are you sleeping? Am I dreaming? Whether you’re real or a fantasy, please don’t go away. What do you think? Shall we go to the horses? Isn’t it retro a bit? And where did you learn to ride horses so well? I come from a place not far away from here. My father was a real Goral. He could do everything himself. We had two geldings to pull timber. Well, I see that boys from Tessin Silesia are very versatile. My father used to say: "Heaven is high, God is far." "We have to help ourselves, when good luck is further from us than from others." And what about your mum? Have you come to see her? She doesn’t have a slightest idea that I’m here. But when she comes to know, that’s gonna be wild. - Robin, can you help me? - Sure. Come in. But don’t put off your shoes, you Barefoot. - Hey, dude. - Okay, Michael the Boss. What prank is this? Gosh, I didn’t know the minority genres pay such a big money. No soldier will let the task go until it’s been done. You remember that, don’t you? No, no. I had an exempt from military service on psychological grounds. So...I don’t know that. Why am I asking you, then? That’s why you constantly play the pop shit. How’s it going? Any problem in the camp? No, not at all. Quite contrary. Everything’s all right. I came to say a word of thanks to you. You give us great service here. Fantastic. There’s just one little thing... I think you should give a little bit more attention to your Klara. I think she really gets on well with Robin. Just to make sure nothing goes wrong. I’m your buddy, y’know. I know what you’re after. You need to humiliate the boy. Degrade him. No worry about Klara. If I were you, I’d pray that Schwarz never finds out that it was Robin who authored all your new hits. And that he plays and sings with the band a thousand times better than you. Well, I just want to make sure nothing goes wrong. I’m your buddy, y’know. Listen, unlike you, I am still somebody. Somebody.. Somebody who will always remain Ferdinand Barefoot. Even if he calls himself Michael the Boss. And now get out. Can you stop that? I need to concentrate and rehearse the lyrics. If you look after the wood yourself, I can go sunbathing, too. Who do you think you are, you silly cow? Look at yourself. You smell of sweat and have sawdust even in your crotch. Cool your jets, girl. In 10 minutes the stage will be cleaned. Such a pretty girl, even VIP, and she can’t read. Stop it. Let’s make a baby. - No. - I’ll marry you. No, stop it. You’re drunk. Stop it. Sit tight, will you? Will you play something for me? Let our fire burn, let the flames go up; Hearts melt and you ask what new things are coming. The sparks will burn the last sins inside us to a cinder, to a cinder! The smoke carries us to heaven And God will tell us where He dwells on high. More than ever He stays with us Forever! Night of passion, In the strange darkness; Night of passion, The one thing I wanted to give you! How’s it going? I see Mr. Musician looks after you. So she’s gonna have money to pay your debts, huh? She doesn’t owe you anything. - You’re kidding me!... she doesn’t owe... - Let her go! Piss off, dude. The coke costs something, kitty. Leave her alone, you bastard. Get out of here or I’ll smash your face. This happens quite often to him since the accident. I see it is clear. Love, you either pay or you’ll work it off. And if not, I’ll find you even if you’re in hell. Get it?? Fool. Whose is this quack-quack? Yours? No, no. It belongs here. I see, Mr. Producer. Hush. Hello? Yes, doctor. Sure. We’re working our socks off. Well, I’ve written a new song for Erika. A total smash hit, you’ll see. And when are you coming to see us, doctor? What? Tomorrow morning? Well, yes. Sure, we’re ready. Ok, bye. Well ladies, put on a nice dress tomorrow, as the producer is coming. He’s bringing the press, photographers... ...the entire circus. We’re back in the ring. So call me, I’m not alone; Standing on the feet I swear that I love you being around! I was melting like last year’s snow, when I was kissing you. Now we toast with champagne! Bravo! Ladies and gentlemen, if all songs are going to be that great ... ...the halls will burst at the seams. And I tell you you’ll have to drive fans out of your dressing rooms. Believe me. I must admit that Robin helped me with this song. He’ll become a gold bug one day. At least a half the size of me. Do you realize that this is already my third song that you turned into crap? So far you haven’t come up with any song of yours. The boys know that so don’t make a fool out of me in front of them. You won’t blackmail me again. I warn you! If you grab one single song of mine, I’ll make sure your producer learns everything. Ok, take it easy. Oh, come on. You’ll thank me one day, buddy. You’ll see. And you know what? We’ll discuss it after rehearsal, ok? We’ll get a few shots and everything’s gonna be all right. And...put some plaster on your eye, you hero. Ok guys, let’s finish today. You can pack up. Erika, will you come by afterwards? We need to discuss your solo song with Robin. Thank you. If you want, just give me a kiss And my hands will warm up in yours. I know who my loved one is, I know why I wear a smile. With a lipstick I draw my heart on the wall, With my and your name inside. Don’t forget who my loved one is, Don’t forget why I wear a smile. This is our love, this is our day and night. This is our love, May it stay with us forever. When blues falls on me and I feel like having a drink, And there are girls who kiss better, Then it’s bad, I don’t know what to do. Then it’s bad, I hide from the truth. This is our love, this is our day and night. This is our love, May it stay with us forever. This wasn’t a good idea, really. If you don’t want to have it buried in dung, you should move your car. Love, I park my car where I want. Clear? You know who I am? Schwarz. Doctor Schwarz. I don’t care whether you are “Schwarz” or “Weiss”, but if you don’t move your car in a minute, I’ll get it clamped. So if you want to, park the car somewhere else then. And do you wish to pay per day or per week? I don’t care if it’s per month! Then it’s eighteen and a half thousand. Michael, is this your 100% commitment? - What are you doing here? - Erika, what the fuck are you doing here? - Who’s this dandy? - You’re married? Married? Come on, dude! - Stop it. He’s our guitarist Robin. - Now only Robin, please. So is it daddy’s job? Pardon me then. What are you gaping at, dude? Dress up and get out of here. You finished here. And in the band, too. Are you kicking me out of my own band? - Yes, seriously. - Daddy pays it all. He’s Mike’s producer. What? You mean Schwarz, huh? - Yeah. - Are you Schwarz? Doctor Schwarz. Where is Michael? We have a rehearsal, but we overslept. He’s in the camp. So put some dress on and get out. Both of you. Get out immediately. And I’m paying that. What is the atmosphere in your team before your great comeback? After all, the boys are younger. Well, they’re young and I’m the experienced one. As you see, the atmosphere is fantastic. So they brought the new suits for us And threw our past to the river. Under new coat you quickly forget. In fact, we are one big family. Hi, doctor. What’s going on here? Slow down, mind that you don’t suffer a heart attack. I’ll tell you slow. You now quickly explain to me why there’s this guitar nobody in your room lying in bed with my daughter? You mean this... Well a summer romance will not make you a grandfather. I hope not. - But you can search for a new guitarist. - Come on. It’s not gone that bad. - What do you want here? - I’ve come to pick my guitar, if I may. And this – if I can ask you Mr. Producer – give this back to your daughter. So that she’s not cold. You want a guitar? So you’ll have two. You bastard. - I’m going there. - It’s ok, take it easy. Please. What’s up, boys? If I get it right, you have some kind of contract, don’t you? And if you leave, you’re going to owe big money to me. And you’ll be in a pretty mess. Not that I was forcing boys into it, but it looks that it’s you who’s in a mess, Michael the Boss. Damn! Doctor, say something. Otherwise they will all leave. Come on, boys. Come on! You’re gonna earn big money with me. You don’t need him. You’ll be famous, you’ll have a good time. Don’t be hysterical, please! I’ll get you other ones. Maybe not that young ones, but definitely better ones. You can bet on it. I myself will keep calm. At least for the sake of Erika. I’ll call Stephan. Listen, Scribbler, you’re here because I pay you for that. Not that you release anything of what happened here without my authorization. And I’ll take this with me straightaway. Just in case. I see that while I was gone for a little moment, you’ve been trying to organize things even in my camp, am I right? - You know each other? - Who wouldn’t know Dr. Schwarz. Everyone who means something in our business knows him. Then I don’t understand why you know me. See? He can kick your ass in such a way that you’ll look forward to it. I’ve let some fresh air in here so that everyone can breathe better. No need to clean the air here. You’re in the mountains here, not in Prague. Doctor paid for a whole month’s stay including the parking. Well, I see you’re an honoured guest now, so I invite you for a drink. Thank you. Cheers then! We’re drinking this calibre. Cheers. That’s a bit too much, dude. Same as the crazy thing you wear around your neck. She gave it to me when I was sixteen and I haven’t taken it off since. It’s bringing me luck. Klara. Hmm. It’s a shame you didn’t wear it during the accident. It’s been pricking my conscience ever since. I shouldn’t have forced you into doing the three gigs. Don’t give a damn about it. It’s over. You couldn’t have anticipated such a bad weather and me riding a motorcycle, could you? - And I needed money then. - I know that. You see. Now I’m happy to be here. Also with your help, I admit. I’ll never forget you lent me some cash for the thing. Oh, don’t mention it. Hmm, but still ... they were good times. They’ll never come back, won’t they? Don’t be sentimental. You’d better reconsider the sack you gave them. The boys are not that bad, mainly Robin. You should listen to them without Michael. Hell, Izzi, you know that I never change my mind on principle. And besides, it really pisses me off that this nobody fucks my daughter. Well, do as you think then. But don’t forget that each of us was once a nobody. And that we fucked someone else’s daughters. Cheers! Ok, cheers. Oh come on, stop crying all the time. If I had cried so bad because of every man I had slept with, there would be two Niles instead of Vltava now. Do you like him? You do! So you had it off with him. So what. Hey, and did your piper have a case on his pipe? Well, I’m not completely sure something happened. We were both drunk. What upsets me more is the fact that my dad will fire him from the band because of me. I don’t care for the other things. It’s a piece of cake for doctors. Do you want a slap in the face? Never repeat this again in front of me. I once was as stupid as you. I also wanted to make a career and be famous. Today I’d give everything for having a chance to be a mother again. You’d better go away. Please, do. Fleeting is the glory of the stars That stubbornly Shine in heaven for us. We belong to anyone who wants to have us that night. Out of our pockets we pull senseless talk, Sweeter than honey but hard to believe. I’m not persuading you; You can go, go! When the curtain comes down, Every clown reaches the end of their tether. Even without us the ship of fools keeps sailing. When the curtain falls, You darken your door, Your dreams behind the threshold are rolling about. life goes on... That’s how it was. And we were much worse off than when we started. We had nowhere to sleep, no self-confidence and a lot more debts. Wait, boys. But I was happy, really happy that the boys went with me. Better try it with the keys. Thanks God. Hi, lads. But I haven’t ordered any funeral or wedding orchestra. So what have you got to say, you sons of God Apollo? Father, an awkward thing happened to us. We got a sack and we badly need help for a couple of days. At least until we sort things out. If you suffice with a bunk and a blanket for sleep and a vicar’s modest meal and if you best contemplate in repairing the church, then you can stay here for as long as you wish. - Agreed? - Agreed. Klara. Sleep. I’m going for a horse-ride. Bye then. Maestro, I have a song here that you might be interested in. If it’s not Izzi who convinces Schwarz, then nobody does. He’d do absolutely anything for Erika. Frankly, Robin should be glad that Schwarz didn’t kill him straightaway. Erika is silly. She shouldn’t provoke him. I’m just sad that the boys had to leave. Klara, you’re a beautiful girl. You can have as many Robins as you wish. Don’t exaggerate, please. And by the way, who do you think you take after? Mummy or daddy? I’ve never met my father, but I guess I take a little bit after my mom. Look. Wasn’t she beautiful? Is this your mom? You asshole. You bastard. You motherfucker. You not only can’t park your fucking car, but you don’t even know when it’s time to stop? Did you enjoy that, you bastard? Then you left. Come here. Do you think of her sometimes? This is my mom, daddy. This is my mom, you know? According to what I saw it looks that she really is your daughter. If I were a river, would you be my source that warms me up like fire? If I were a sea, would you be my wave and torment and love me to the fullest! Maybe because I’m your desert and you’re my drought; We’ve wasted our love; it’s gone with the air. The air is clean now; let’s keep fingers crossed, Our hearts beat side by side inside this war. Ouch. You look like a war veteran. You look great. I’ve never done it with a mummy. Here I’ve found some remains of the paint. That’s how we finished a work shift in Scouts. So let’s go for a meal, lads. I must say that you know how to go about the work just as well as strumming a guitar. It would have never occurred to me that you’d manage that much before harvest time. We’re really glad that we can stay here, Pastor. But it’s high time we start to fix our debts. So tomorrow we’ll go and ask for a job in ironworks factory. And what about trying something in your industry? You mean somebody hiring us as the band? Don’t you think a Nightingale? Or an Angel. Don’t know. But I heard you play near the river. People were having fun, so why couldn’t you try your own performance without Michaels the Bosses or the Nightingale contests, but with a guardian angel above your head. You’ll pay off your debts and you can follow your musical dreams. Hi, Ferdi. Here we are. You call me Ferdi once more and I’ll kick you out before you ever start playing. Is it clear? Sorry, I never knew you’d be so angry when you arrived so lightly dressed and with no shoes. Gentlemen! From this moment you all call me Michael the Boss. Clear? Clear, Barefoot. Assholes. Today you have the chance; You’re just here, no hurry; Whether it’s night or day, I’m here with you, no worry. Somewhere in the clouds my soul is turning; All paths lead to you suddenly. What a special gift; So call me, I’m not alone; Standing on the feet I swear that I love you being around! I was melting like last year’s snow, when I was kissing you. Now we toast with champagne! Hi Izzi, do you want me to help you? You’re in a mood for fun? I wouldn’t be so amused if I were you. But you’re really a bit of a lad that you haven’t grassed Barefoot up to Schwarz. And what would it be good for? Look, Izzi, I’ve come to ask also on behalf of the boys as we are no longer Michael’s band, if we can come by in the evenings as usual. I mean, before we definitely leave. We are thinking about doing a show here. Definitely not today. We have a private party here. It’s Klara’s birthday. I see...and could I at least wish her a happy birthday? Well, I don’t think ... Ok, do come. And bring others with you, too. Great. So see you in the evening. I’m looking forward. Me, too. Thanks to Klara’s birthday Izzi after a long time appeared on stage with his old band together. And I’ll tell you, it was a great gig. We have strength and we have a dream; We drift with the tide. The boy who flies and the mahogany wood That’s as tough as me, you and him; We have strength and we are kin; A fool is here, also a gentleman. Is there a cowboy here? A millionaire? None of us, we breathe fresh air. We have strength and we are kin; Together we are a team. We are heading to you and we’re gonna play; Hands up to the sky who’s gonna stay. We go from dusk till dawn; There’s so few of us, we are alone. We are thin on the ground; There’s so few of us, we are alone. Bugger him, Izzi. I invite you for a drink, boys. Izzi, that’s a stunner, it’s great. The girls are totally crazy about you. You know what? Clean up the mess here. Good music unites people, but Izzi and me became more and more divided by Klara. - Hi boys. - Hi. I’m looking for Robin. - He’s behind the church, writing lyrics. - Ok. - How’s your head? - It’s ok. Izzi always told me that I have my head in the clouds. - Am I not disturbing you? - No. I came to thank you for the flowers. Really, I mean I have never been given such beautiful ones. And where did you sneak away so early? I left with the boys; they needed to have a sleep. The church exhausts them quite a lot. Read something to me. - You mean this? - No, Shakespeare. Song lyrics are not poems. It’s not quite the same as with music. Robin, please, no lectures, ok? I’m living with a musician, am I not? Oh, gosh, read something at last. I truly loved a few times in life, Other days we only had fun. A shallow feeling, trifling hugs, for one fading moment take you to heaven beyond the clouds. The fleeting touches you let them go, but you won’t escape those that break your soul. This is who I am, I want no quarrelling; You’ve just stepped into my destiny. Go on, please. The magic trick – how deceptive it is; Can’t wait for wisdom, your heart breaks to pieces. You won’t succumb to the deadly shots, Your wounded soul is raven dark. In reckless ecstasy, with an icon around your neck; After sleepless night the angels send you blessings, if you’re proposed to by a Don Juan. Beautiful. But I think the Pastor should hear it with music. You’re right. Robin, would you come to see the Goral folk festival with me? Let’s go. Let’s have a drink. Two Miodulas, please. And who’s going to pay? Mom or this lady? Mom, what are you doing here? You have the feeling that your bills for health and social insurance will pay themselves, don’t you? - Mom... - No, leave me alone. Tomorrow I’ll come around, I promise. I’m not curious about the fables of yours. You really think that I need to see you? I don’t. Excuse me, Miss. Never mind. - Thanks, mom. - Robin, you’re an idiot. Hmm, I am. Kollár Brothers! Thomas is here. Come on. [in dialect] Aaah, what is an Eastern Goral doing on a border triangle among Silesian Gorals? [in dialect] Drinking Miodula, singing songs and smiling at nice chicks. That’s what I call an encounter at the right time in the right place. Hi! Robin, what are you doing here at the Goral festival? You haven’t changed genre, have you? No, not at all, but I’ve got certain interests here. But I see you are stars now. Concerts, albums. I’m happy for that, guys. It was our dream since we were in school. But how about you? There were times when the sky was sunny, now it’s overcast a bit. But I’m not complaining. I have an idea, boys. Let’s play this smasher. Hey, Falcons. You know the lyrics. We’ve got the hats and waistcoats. So no problem with that. - I don’t know if ... - Come on! Sorrow, sorrow for that girl, For green Ukraine; Sorrow, sorrow, heart is crying, I will see her no more. Hey, hey, hey falcons! Fly past the mountains, forests and valleys. Ring, ring, ring little bell, My steppe little skylark. Hey, hey, hey falcons! Fly past the mountains, forests and valleys. Ring, ring, ring little bell, My steppe little – ring, ring, ring. The stars are asleep; they won’t turn back the clock; Your glance is a wall inside us. Should I let you go or let you stay locked in a haze; And sooner or later I want to ask the old questions! I’m on my knees... - What was the festival like? - Good. Were there many people you know? No. So maybe seeing a psychologist will loosen your tongue a bit. It’s been a year now. And those who try it once cannot be sure of themselves until the rest of their lives. These are our rules, is it clear? Until the rest of our lives? You know I love you. Hi Klara, I’m very happy for you. I’ve got something for you. A badge of Schwarz Foundation. It’s a symbol of your three-year abstinence. It will remind you of the path that you’ve already made. And it will give you the strength to go on. Schwarz Foundation? Hmm. Thanks to it, we managed to save many lives. Perhaps even yours. - Thank you. - Good luck, then. - Hold on. - Yeah. Pista, don’t bother about the loudspeakers. Come on; let’s have a drink at the bar. Yeah, I’ll b-be there in a m-minute. As s-soon as I’ve f-finished the installation for Robin. I-it would b-be extremely r-risky to play with that. It’s v-very b-badly insulated. Forget it. Robin will play it without effects, even with nothing but a broomstick. Ok. Look who’s coming. Hi! - Am I not too early? - Rather late. We’re nearly dry up and the festival has already finished. Wait a moment, lads. This costume is the pride of the Pieniny Mountains. How I look forward to this evening, boys! Good music is needed like a dose of salts. Nothing against you. But Kollár Brothers are Kollár Brothers. They are the only ones who can play our Goral music. Cheers! So you’ve finally met some celebrities. Wait, you’re telling this to me who’s on the first names terms with Mike Jagger? Boys, when they had their first gig at Strahov Stadium in the 90’s, I was their backstage security member. I needed to pee then, so I nipped to the gents and as I was standing there peeing, I took a look to the right and then to the left. Then suddenly on my left side there was Mike Jagger. He smiled and said: "Hi, big one." So I smiled, too, and said: "Hi, Mike." And we’ve known each other ever since. Well, maybe he said hello to your "big one". No, seriously, when was it you saw him last? As I said, in the toilet room. Mama beats me up; And you’re the only one I love. Marysha, don’t ask your mom and give me a kiss; Y’know she has been like that since her young years. Marysha gave a kiss and did not ask her mom; Knowing she has been like that since she was young. Mom is sitting in a church while My loved one and me are having a good time in a barn. Asshole, have one! Playing in Izzi’s club has brought many fans to us from all over the region. We never would have believed how many great musicians would take a notice of us. Now I’ll show you what it is like to be a true rocker. No Izzi, you’re drunk. Izzi, what’s the matter? Never mind, you’ve drunk too much. Tomorrow is another day. Izzi! Fuck! Samaritan. Izzi, don’t let me hang here. Izzi! Izzi! Hold on, I’ll call emergency. - Izzi! - Wait. Izzi! Fuck it! Izzi, please don’t leave! Fuck! Let our fire burn, let the flames go up; Hearts melt and you ask what new things are coming. The sparks will burn the last sins inside us to a cinder, to a cinder! The smoke carries us to heaven And God will tell us where He dwells on high. More than ever He stays with us forever! - I-i-isn’t it J-Jarek over there? - Who? Jarek Nohavica. Excuse me. You are Jarek, aren’t you? Izzi and I knew each other for years. I liked him. - I’m sorry.. I am... - ... Robin, I know. Hits for Michael, well, and the big concert now. And how do you know? You can hardly keep a secret here. Take it in a way that Izzi will watch it tomorrow. Hmm. It’s been too much these days. And I don’t have any idea if any people are coming. Don’t worry, sure they are. Blood wandering, the two-headed dragon; No matter they break my wings, I’ll fly up higher. Blood insane, the dragon’s tongue hanging out; In the name of love you can wave me goodbye! So call me, I’m not alone, Standing on the feet I swear That I love you being around! I was melting like last year’s snow, when I was kissing you. Now we toast with champagne! Great job, boys. It wasn’t bad at all. Good. - Thanks. - Congratulations. So what do you think, doctor? Good? Yeah, it wasn’t crap at all. But it feels, buddy, that your tyres have worn all the way down. Well, the car rides well, but it lacks the adrenalin, the juice. You see? And we need to discuss the contract later. Hi, so what do you think? Did you like the duet? Great. Really. You’ve been a surprise to me. -You mean it? -Sure. It was Robin, the guitarist, who’s written it. The guitarist... I think he has also a concert, hasn’t he? At the river. I plan to go there. To come and see whether he’s just as good on stage as in bed with my daughter. And besides, Michael. The boy outmatched you in the number of likes long time ago. You know about it? Well, maybe doing a tour together might not be a bad idea, what do you think? He could be your front-runner. And eventually you could be his. At least I’d kill two birds with one stone. - Dad, can I go with you? - Yeah, why not? So I’m going to change clothes. So chin up, will you? Doctor! But in its second half it starts to have a ball. You’ll see. Make sure that you have the balls, too. You’re going with me; your mission here is over. After all, I’m not sure what you’ll be good for, without a driving license, huh? No worry, buddy, habit is a second nature. I’d be lost without you. And moreover, you’ve made me a father-of-two. Thanks. And hopefully Stephan will fix the driver’s license, won’t he? Let’s go. I’ll show you a front-runner. Two birds with a stone... Just wait. How about Schwarz, ok? What do you mean by ok? It’s all fucked up. And your chorus girls? Haven’t you seen it? They’d better sing. They twist themselves as if they have diarrhoea. - No talent, no invention, nothing. - Don’t be silly! What could I expect of a failed Moulin Rouge dancer? Today you’d starve to death even at Piccadilly. Look at yourself. What’s the matter?! You’re fired. I’ll show you. Look, just quite by chance, don’t you have a telephone number to the mayor of the village down near the river? That’s where the concert should take place. Life is a fair of worthless trifles, An oasis of deceitful dabblers. You get loge box seats for dump price, No matter whether you bring buddies or your wife. Hi, Stephan. So far it’s not raining over here... ... the wave? Are you kidding me? Even a bigger one than last year? Come here. Go and cancel it immediately. Right now! Withdraw it, immediately! - What’s the matter? - A torrential wave is coming. Water is coming. Immediately. Hurry up; it’s finished. I..I... I am very sorry. I’m sorry but a torrential rain is coming. So we’ll have to clean it out here. I’m sorry. They called that a downpour’s coming. Last year it caused such a mess ... Look. It swept away the stage along with the players. I’m sorry, doctor. Doctor Schwarz soon realized who had stood behind the cancellation of our concert near the river. And the revenge came shortly afterwards as the contract with Michael was cancelled. Bastard! Never mind. You know what father used to say. Heaven is high, God is far. We must help each other. We’ll make it. - Hi Robin. - Hi. Can’t sleep, huh? I know this. One wants to get all things sorted out before a concert. So don’t bother; leave it as it is. Believe me. Many things in life will fix themselves, Robin. I have a gift for you. Here it is, it’s yours. Thank you. - Izzi’s guitar? - Hmm. It’s the most precious one from his collection. At that time he sold it to gain money to pay Klara’s debts. I managed to get it back. It’s yours. Look after it just as you look after your girlfriend, ok? Sure. And if I can ask you one thing, will you play the gig on it tomorrow? Well, it’s not gonna be a big deal then. A riff has just crossed my mind; can I show it to you? The concert that was a tribute to Izzi and that Dr Schwarz helped us with enabled us to get to the top among the real musicians. And now it will only depend on our effort, if it’s just for a while or forever. We bear our cross, a long journey ahead; We’ll have arrived when desire shows us our direction and our destination. Let’s go, boys. Ladies and gentlemen, it looks that somebody played a joke on us and that no wave is coming. But at least we’ve found out that we all pull together. My father used to say: Better a beer in stomach, than water on lungs. And we would like to dedicate this song to my dad, Izzi and to all musicians who drink with him in a heavenly bar. Cheers! Well, ladies and gentlemen, I was wrong. The wave has come. And our song came with it, too. To all those who love musicians and music. Jarek Nohavica! We bear our cross, a long journey ahead; We’ll have arrived, when desire shows us our direction and our destination In the march of time all wounds get healed; We’ll meet at the same Heaven’s gate In a moment. What’s left? Rise again when there’s no strength left; Thank for every moment When we can sing and play. Soar above the white clouds And not be afraid of the fateful moments; And cherish as a gift everything I keep inside. Keep going on and on despite pitfalls; We’ll go on paths paved by footprints And follow our dreams behind horizons. In the march of time all wishes come true; We all will reconcile at the same Heaven’s gate. What’s left? Rise again when there’s no strength left; Thank for every moment When we can sing and play. Soar above the white clouds And not be afraid of the fateful moments And cherish as a gift Everything I keep inside. Keep going on and on despite pitfalls; And just among us, Life is a big show after all. After the concert we had with Jarek our playing finally got a real drive. A contract with Schwarz came soon afterwards; Vilma finally had her dream wedding with Beda in Paris, Erika started dating Thomas from Kollar Brothers and they left for the Tatras. And Michael the Boss? Well, we’re all musicians. My head is spinning when I look into your eyes, black as a deep night. And your lips red – there is something to that; Everyone is longing for them. Your hair is curly like a spring twig, And its colour – a raven could feel jealous of it. Your snow-white hands are caressing me, I want to kiss you on your sweet lips. Give me a kiss, a sweet little kiss, please; Love is fluttering right above our heads. Give me a kiss, please, or maybe not; May our love stay with us forever.
