Why don’t we stop here... There’s nothing more I can say. C’mon. Let’s talk more about Ms. Jieun Chae. I said what I got to say. Listen. Can’t you see we’re just here to help you as colleagues? 10 Years ago Wanna burn my eye brows? Got taken aback, bitch! What a manner, idiot! Wonkyung! Wonkyung, can we talk for a second? Hey! You wanna talk then you come here! Who do you think you are to tell to come and go? Sweetie, it won’t take long, okay? Damn... make it quick then! What happened to your eye? Did your dad get drunk and hit you again? Told you come to my place if he gets drunk like last time! Hey, my dad’s taking me out for dinner cuz I got a gold medal. Come along! Well... I’m supposed to hang with Changbae... Stop hanging out with Changbae. I think he’s a bit strange. He’s not that bad person like you think. See you at school tomorrow then! I’m gonna make the national team squad for a college scholarship. Just concentrate at practicing sweetie! Such a shame we couldn’t support you at fine arts you were so talented in. Please, don’t worry about it. Dang! What a reckless bikers! Don’t mind them honey, please! THE LOST CHOICES You have a speech problem due to the accident, right? Yes! ...can hear alright but can’t speak properly? - Ms. Che? - Yeah? I really like all of your designs. It’s unique and powerful. What do you think Jay? Like you said, her works are eye-catching. I’ll forward your resume to HR right away. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Wonkyung! Come to my office later on. I’m supposed to recommend two contract workers for permanent positions this month. I’m thinking you for one of the positions. What’s your thought on that? Championship No, no! I’m on the rag today. Just take a shower after we fuck! I said no! Fuck! You’ve been complaining lately for no reason! Why’d you make me hit you!!! Stay still for a second!! Stop it! I said no! Why! Wha, What? Wo...n...kyu...ng... She’s busy now! Stuttering cunt, what are you crazy? Just scram! You fuckin’ poked my eyes bitch! What? What! I really hate you bitch! Got that, supid? Don’t fuck around. Det. Park, even loan sharks are at my door steps because of my higher interest rates. I used my house as collateral without my wife knowing. Just make sure payments are on time. Lunch break guys! You all know we have a team dinner after work. What are you looking at? Hey! Speed up, speed up! Please say nothing. Please. Let’s leave soon. To where? Where can we possibly go? Let’s leave this place soon... and Changbae too. In fact... So to where? And what’s so bad about Changbae? It was him who accepted me without any condition when I ran away from a violent alcoholic father. Ja-ryun... Shit! Damn it! Hey! Where’s everyone? All went to bust the illegal gambling house. Why didn’t you go? Didn’t I tell you to hold up the raid? Det. Kang led the whole team to the bust. Shit, when I say hold, you... Fuck! Bitch! Shit, why you bitching at me? Sangbum Mah is long gone already. Place him on the wanted list and arrest all these idiots! - Let’s go! - Let me go! - Let’s make this easy lady! - I wasn’t playing but just watching! I’m being falsely accused man! You tell that at the station sir! You’ve been working real hard lately Wonkyung! Let me pour you a drink! Gosh! Sorry! Are you okay? My bad. Cheers! What a surprise! Remember the interview I talked about? I think I did really well and am optimistic about it. Jieun! You’re putting me in an awkward situation. I really gotta get that position! You know it’s a rare opportunity. Once I become a regular worker, I’ll get all the benefits and overtime. You got design in your pocket. Me? Nothing. When your boss says go, you go, okay? That’s how it works! I really don’t feel well today. Please, cut me some slack! Hey, she said she doesn’t feel well. You’re coming? Hey, let’s go! - Changbae, wait! Wait! - Fuck! Let’s go now! Hi! This is Jay at M-Game. I apologize for contacting you late. HR’s still considering your resume. Once I hear from HR, I’ll let you know. What? Are you a fuckin’ mute? See? Didn’t I say I could do it? You really did it, bro! Hey, but... she’s a fuckin’ mute! Hey, Sanghyun! Mutes have pussies too! This bitch is cute enough to fuck! What the fuck! Come here and hold her! Fuckin’ cunt! Hey! Don’t beat around, just do her! Okay! I’ll fuck her now! Okay! She ain’t got no cash! Wasn’t fun or what? Fuck yeah! Fuckin’ good aight! You’ve got a problem? You come too quick. Damn, smells nasty. Let’s go! Hey, Sanghyun! Nasty, nasty... I don’t have any problem down there. My dick is in the major-leagues! Whatever! Just stop drinking you idiot! Would you guys shut up for a second! You want me to handcuff your mouths too? You want me to book you without feeding your ass tonight? My mind is all uneasy already and can’t find peace of mind. Let’s go. Didn’t I tell you I did it without my wife’s knowing? Sure, Sure! Please have faith in the Korean national police! Well, we, police... Do some work, buddy! I can’t make my move now. Just wait a bit, sir! I‘ll make sure you get the principal. It’s not matter of the principal. You’d better take care of it in a few days! You fuck up, I’ll fucking end you! Got that? Fuck! You have the nerve to eat now? What the hell is this? Remember their faces? Not really... I was so scared... At least we need the descriptions if you want me to get these guys! Anyways, just write down your ID number and address. And talk in detail when the policewoman comes. Hey, Song is on duty tonight, right? Send her to my desk now. What’s this? What about it? You mean DNA test? That’s his... We need a medical report to substantiate this rape case... You do that after the policewoman comes. For now, just give me your contact info... You’re wearing jeans? Unlike a skirt... It’s not easy to strip off tight jeans. And... You’re a stutterer not a mute. Am I right? Yes. What I’m trying to say is... If you were screaming for your life, wouldn’t at least one person hear? Just my personal opinion, no offense! Send Song asap for God’s sake! Did you? Alrighty then! Are you telling me I’m lying right now? That’s not exactly what I meant... What the...what the hell! Just sent her away? What’d you mean by that? You should’ve checked her into the hospital right away! Shit...okay! Tell him I’m coming in now! God Damn it! Hey! Turn on the siren and hurry up! You left your ID Card. So I came to return it. I... Ain’t I kind? Intuition my ass! You know half of those girls are all bullshit! There’re a lot of’em! How would you know whether she’s a real rape victime or not? Why would she leave if she was a real victim? Didn’t you say she had a disability? You should’ve calmed her down and be more careful... What are you? My superior? Who do you think you are? Just do your own job! And stop acting flippantly, would you? Okay then. Hand over the case to me. I’ll handle the case myself! Shit you crazy! Your rank is a lot lower than mine. Don’t wanna get stepped on by a lower rank? Then do a better job! Now you’re stepping over the line! Yo!!!! Try to wrap up, guys! I’m sorry! Control your temper, Det. Kang! Who’s gonna ask you out with that temper! Det. Park! You go home and get some rest too! What’s this! Damn! What an innocent lady you are! But fucking like a whore! Let me make love to you...okay? Fuck! Fuck! I’m so fucked! Why are you doing this to me? Spare me, please! Ms. Jieun Chae? Yes? I’m Det. Kang from the Incheon Dongbu Police Station! You came by our station earlier, right? First of all, we apologize for our misunderstanding earlier. I’ll be in charge of your case from now on. Is it for us to come in and ask a few questions? No, not today! I feel really sick today, sorry. Let’s go to the hospital first then. We need a medical certificate anyway. I know it’s hard but we need to have some medical examinations. Other than the hair samples, swabs may need to be... No thank you! You all just go away, please! It’s bit strange, isn’t it? What’s strange? Her attitude. As a rape victim... What attitude is a rape victim supposed to have? That’s not what I meant. Just drop me off right there, would you? I’ll drop you off at the entrance. Nah... I just wanna smoke before I go in. You can go. Congratulations! HR finally decided to hire you. They will contact you with more detailed information soon. Reverse! Reverse! Reverse! Jieun! What’s the matter today? Wake up! Let’s hurry before that fat bitch goes nuts! Enough! I don’t trust you guys! Nope! I can’t trust you guys! Either you don’t trust or can’t trust, the choice rests with you. But if we don’t do anything about it, those bastards will do it again because they’ll think it’s okay. It’s quite possible there’ll be more victims other than you. Gotta stop’em! We gotta catch those bastards at all costs! I know it’s not easy but please have the courage for others as well. I’ll think about it. Jieun! Would you like to have a lunch with me? Try these dishes too. Why? It doesn’t taste good? I’m just full now. Well, I’ll eat then. Do you have a hobby at all? Design. You two are very similar. Excuse me? I have a little sister your age... My sister can’t speak as well because of an accident. What accident? It’s a long story. I’ll tell you next time. By the way, what did you ask earlier? ...self defense... Ah, that’s right! Self-defense! In fact there’s eight criteria that have to be met but they’re all so ambiguous. For instance, you can’t use deadly weapons... Your level of violence can’t exceed theirs. Korean Laws. What’d you expect? So generous for the strong and way too strict for the weak. Congratulations! HR finally decided to hire you. They will contact you with more detailed information soon. Jieun... I’m sorry for how I acted last time... I didn’t mean it, okay? Can I stay over tonight? When Changbae comes home, he’ll beat and molest me cuz I’m drunk. But... Why? Are you still mad at me? No... no... Then what’s the matter? I just wanna be alone tonight... Seriously, I’m gonna get beat up tonight. Can I hide here tonight my friend? Fuckin’ A! I gotta pay the interest! What do you mean you don’t have 5 grand? What a fucking situation!!!! Listen! Get my money right away, okay? Fuckin’ A! I think there’s a snitch on our side. Confirm the transactions on the account we’re chasing. And keep contacting Sanghyun to chase Sanbum’s whereabouts! What’s that? Shit! I’m not gonna take it, stupid! Hey, don’t stir up useless hopes to Wonkyung, okay? Wanna fucking leave? Then leave alone! Do you think she can live without me? Do you think she can ever get away from me? So back the fuck off before I beat your sorry ass up! I told you I’m on my way to get some money! Okay! Enough already! DNA Test? I can help you with it quick! Isn’t this Ms. Jieun Chae’s place? What an attitude! Yeah. - I guess she’s not home? - She went out earlier. Who are you by the way? Shit! I said... who the fuck are you? Are you her man or what? Are you the one who fucked her the other night? They were doing it so fucking loud and crazy... I‘m not sure exactly when... When? It’s exactly same day she lied about her rape bullshit! WIFE Let me go around few more times, sweetie. She went out wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt. Oh, shit! Got’cha! Ms. Chae! Ms. Chae! Ms. Chae! You gotta go to the station with me now! Why? I have a few questions to ask you. Who were you at home with after you made your claim? We received some anonymous information... Look, Ms. Chae! Falsifying a rape case can lead to immediate imprisonment! What? It doesn’t make sense that a lady would want to have sex on the same day after being raped. Cases like this go to summary courts. But maybe I can give you a break this time tho. To go easy on this case, I might need about 5 grand... Hey, Ms. Chae! You’re not in the position to have an attitude now! What the hell is this? Who the fuck are you? Let’s go! You crazy bitch! You’re so fucked today! You cried over being raped, but killed a person and mutilated the body? You life is fucking over! Hitting a police officer? That’s obstruction of justice! What a fucking weather on a long-ass day! Do it! Do it, you stupid bitch! Don’t come! Shoot! I dare you to pull that trigger! What the fuck! Call me if something happens. The center of the blank’s residue and the bullet wound are too close. If the blank was a real bullet, the distance between two bullets are way too close, understand? Of course it can be coincidental, but if not... That person is a marksman. What kind of cop carries an extra magazine in Korea? Det. Park always did because he felt insecure. What made him so insecure? He’s a fuckin’ cop! What kind of I.A. operation allows a person to die? You think we expected this? Expected this whole situation? How about Sangbum Mah’s whereabouts? We could trace him until Det. Park met him last time... Then? Lost him after that. That means your informant is not safe either, right? We still need him until we locate Sangbum Mah’s whereabouts. Isn’t Sangbum Mah a prime suspect who murdered Det. Park at this point? There’re bitches in this room who dance with mother fuckin’ police. Listen! I’ll find that mofo asap, got that? HR approved finally. Now I have to choose two contract workers for the permanent positions. Sir? Would you like to go out for drinks tonight? Police are currently investigating the death of Incheon police officer. He is found near an abandoned building in Incheon, Bupyung yesterday. Police officially announced the gunshot wound on Det. Park’s chest was the direct cause of the death and no other wounds were found. The gun used in the crime is Det. Park’s. The gun and extra magazine were missing at the crime scene. Next in the news is... Jaryun! Open the door!!! Jaryun!!! Stand up!! Stand up!! Stand up!! Get up, Jaryun! How long are you gonna be like this? No!! Don’t help her out! Jaryun, you walk out of this hole by yourself! Get out everyone! Jieun! Is it too late? I’m sorry. I really want to talk to you. So could you listen for a while? Okay... Go ahead. I told you I have a little sister who doesn’t speak. It’s been ten years since I heard her voice. Doctors say there’s nothing wrong with her. They say it’s just a psychological thing. I can deal with her not speaking, but it bothers me that she hates me. I’m sure we’ll have a chance I can speak my mind soon... Why is my little sister sick? Why does she hate me so much... Jieun... Can you trust me for once and open your heart to me? So I can catch those bastards who did hurt you... so I can punish them... Can you help me do that? This has extensive records of ex-convicts in this town. If there’s anyone who looks familiar, you just let us know. Where’s the detective who interviewed me first? Ah... something came up. Take your time reviewing it. I’ll be right over there. How’s the investigation coming along? So many people have grudges against Det. Park. From neighborhood bullies to freaking thugs they’re all clinching their teeth when they hear his name. Well, all he wanted were kickbacks. Maybe that’s why. We’re bringing in Sangbum Mah’s henchmen now. What about the informant? He has a heart shaped tattoo on his right shoulder. Keep it on the down low! Gotta release him with a few guys tomorrow so nobody makes him out. Take it off. Right now. - We’re doing it now. - Do it quickly. - Bring your lawyer then! - I will. Det. Kim! Tell them to strip off their shirts! Guys, strip off the top, please! He has a heart shaped tattoo on his right shoulder. Keep it on the down low! Fuck! Why are you fucking making us do that? This is sexual harassment! Sexual harassment by cops! Why is this sexual harassment? You don’t think it is? Why don’t we strip together then? Don’t look up at me! I know you like it. You fuckin’ bastard. How dare you... Stop it! Yes, we do have records on Ms. Chae’s car accident. She was in a Jr. national shooting team at that time. Have a nice day, sir! Where’d she go? She said she’s tired so she went home. Really? When is she coming back? I didn’t ask her. Why not? Oh...oops! Oh, man... Hey, we should grab a quick bite! Fucking A! Hey, wait up!!! - Why’d they release just us? - I don’t know man! Why are you so sensitive? What’s the matter? Hey, what’s gotten into you? Isn’t Ms. Chae supposed to come in today? She is... but she’s not answering the phone. A dead cop and a missing gun, now we have a dismembered body? What on earth is happening to our jurisdiction? Do I really have to be at work at dawn? Damn it! On the 26th a mutilated body in a plastic bag was found under Ara bridge by a cleaning crew... Gichul Lee, that motherfucker? Sure we questioned him. But we didn’t do it. He was long gone before we did him in. Do you like the way you live? Nope. Who wants to live like this? We all live the way we have to live. Should I leave to somewhere, mom? I want to hide somewhere no one can find me Can you help me to do that mom, dad? Oh, by the way, get me some crack. Yeah, manager wants some. Wonkyung will be in the shit-hole once they shoot up together. I gotta go! I’ll talk to you later! What the fuck are you looking at, stupid bitch! What the fuck, you stupid bitch! Letter of Resignation Why... are you... Personnel Appointments: Jo Wonkyung to permanent positions Fucking whore! Fucking cheating on me? What are you looking at? You stupid handicapped cunt! Wanna get beat up again? Don’t fuckin’ push it! Do it!!! Wonkyung! 911. - Incheon...- Incheon. Bupyung... Please speak slowly! Please calm down maa’m! Hello! Are you still there? Hello! Hey, did you do this? So now. even you’re being a bitch? What the fuck is wrong with you! Come here! I’m gonna crush your skull too! Come here! Fucking cunt! Today is your last day... Det. Park’s bullet? Yes. Finished him with one bullet. One shot, one kill. One right here! Det. Jung! Get some more information from this gentleman. Yes, sir! Damn! God Damn it! What’s his ETD? Between 11 to 12 last night, sir. What’s the victim’s occupation? Noh Changbae, 34 years old. No job, just a douchebag, a good-for-nothing. Damn! What on earth is happening now? Family? No family, he’s an orphan. He has a live-in girlfriend who supports his living. Where’s she now? Got her whereabouts yet? Yes, she’s been hospitalized now. Hospitalized? Where’s the body? This way, sir! Hey, Det. Lee. Get my jotter from the car, please. Yes, sir! When was the last time you saw him? The day I got beat up. That’s the last time I saw him. Excuse me? I slept with my boss to get a full time position. I blacked out while getting beat. I was here already, when I woke up. Where do you work? Yoorim Textiles. It’s a fabric factory. By any chance... Do you know Jieun? Chae Jieun? How’d you know my friend, Jieun? It adds up perfectly! A Jr. National shooting team member! Det. Park who screwed up the initial investigation on her case! Her best friend’s violent boyfriend! It’s only circumstantial not tangible. Why don’t we summon her first and... Do you think killing is that easy? How can you possibly be suspicious of her? We’re better off finding his connection with Sangbum Mah. Det. Kang! You know I follow your orders without any questioning. But I can’t help thinking that something’s been going wrong, very wrong this time! Nope! You’re wrong. Just don’t say much when we get back to the station. Let’s go! What should we have? What do youguys feel like? Well... Sandwich or Korean food? Sandwiches sounds like a good simple lunch. Okay, I know a really good place over there then. Det. Kang. Here’s a package for you. Thank you. Dear Det. Kang. It’s not much just a small gift from me. This is Bellona that I designed for your little sister. Please tell her to cheer up too. Hello? Really? Okay! Hey, Det. Kang! Yes, sir! Sangbum Mah’s whereabouts is confirmed. It’s Ansan! Ansan Wongokdong! Well, Det. Kang! I think Jieun Chae... You’d better focus on this raid now. Okay. Who is it? What are you? What the... What a crazy bitch! Hey, you piece of shit! You gotta say something since you rang the bell! What are you? Fucking crazy? Please don’t kill me. So sorry. I’m so sorry! For what? Please tell Mr. Mah I‘m really sorry for what I’ve done. Hey! Don’t contaminate the scene! Go around! Get one more sampling kit! Let’s see, let’s see. Det. Park’s, right? Yes. Two shots to the groin area and one to the forehead. - Two shots on the groin area are... - Yes! The distance between the two shots are less than 3cm. If my guess is right, you’d better catch him asap. This bastard is pro, a freaking pro. Did you confirm the tattoo? Gosh... not it. He’s not? He’s not Sanghyun Kim? Yes. Yes, he is! Det. Park. Changbae Noh. Sanghyun Kim? She’s not it, right? No relevant connection between Jieun and Sanghyun Kim. Oh, man! These false accusations are making me feel aggrieved. Shouldn’t dead people feel more aggrieved than you? If he’s not it, then who the fuck is he? Asshole! Det. Kang speaking. This is Dr. Ahn at the forensic lab. The result’s out. Check the fax now. Okay, sir! Step aside. The result from the DNA test of the submitted hair sample matches the identity of the following person. Name: Sanghyun Kim ID#: 820902-1025982 Jieun, can I meet up with you right now? I can be at your place. Eight seven nine eight seven... Yes, this is Det. Kim. Det. Park’s missing gun... Yes... what was the serial number of the gun? It was a M60 38-caliber revolver with serial number G 87987-25. When I realized I was in hell that I couldn’t escape I just let it happen and prayed while crying to God asking him to finish soon. What a cruel reality I faced! That beast who came back to me on the same day. And I, myself, who had to kill that beast. More terrible thing was I became a person who murdered two people. Jieun! Don’t do this! No more murders. You gotta stop here. I wouldn’t start this... if I was gonna stop here. Let me help you, please! How are you gonna help me out? Even the law can’t help me. Jieun. Don’t make a choice that you’ll regret. Even if I regret it later on, it’s my choice after all. My sister! My little sister! Jaryun is a victim of rape too. She was in middle school... She lost her words after that. We were supposed to go get a new school uniform, but I was late. I was late because I was working... then it happened to her. That fucker who did that to my sister served just six years and lives a comfortable life with just probation. Yes! Never a day passes that I don’t think about killing him. Yes! Never a day passes that I don’t think about tearing him apart. And asking why he did it. But...but that doesn’t solve the problem. You know that too. I am so sorry. I’m almost here. See you in there! Turn on the light! Det. Kang! Are you okay, maa’m? Jieun Chae. Trace her location via her cell-phone. Now! - Trace her right away! - Yes, sir! I told your ass to sell booze not drink for yourself! What are you, fucking alchies? Either way, we’re making you some nice dough, so stop bitching! Shit! Why are you alone? I called three of you! Oh, I’m sorry. How many in your party? What the fuck! Oh, you’re here! Come, Jieun! Ah, this? It’s, it’s just vitamins. You know how much I care about you, right? I didn’t even submit your resignation letter. Wonkyung told me she’s always tired too. I promised to share some vitamins with her. What’s that? You wanna dance? What the hell? Shit! Come with me. Is everything alright? What the fuck! What do you want? Spare me please! Fuck! Why are you doing this to me? Jieun! Put the gun down! You don’t wanna die like this! Put the gun down! Guys, please! Det. Kim! Put the gun down! It’ll be alright. I already died that day... the very day those cockroaches raped me. Don’t do this. You gotta stop here. I went too far. Can you trust me one last time? Please? I can’t trust myself now. Please, don’t do this. Oh, no! Don’t! Jieun, you gotta live! You gotta live to tell the world. How suffocated and mortified you were! How scared and lonely you were! How much you just wanted to live normal life! How much... how much you’ve been hurt! Jieun, don’t do this. I haven’t given your drawing to my sister yet. You walk out of this place live and give it to her yourself. Fuck, man! Fuck! Fuckin’ crazy cunt! I’m so hurt. Please call 911 now, fuck! Wonkyung! You told me you wanted to open a nail salon one day The accounts in the envelope are for you to use in good faith, so I’d like you to accept my offer without any feelings of burden. Please know this, my dear friend. I never resented you, not even once. It was not your fault. You’ve done enough for me, so don’t feel sorry for me anymore. The world we live in should be sorry for us. You and I... We haven’t done any wrong. You’ll be submitted to the ethics committee. Don’t worry. We already coordinated the story. Listen! You saw Jaesung Sah picking up the gun behind Jieun Chae. And you two shot at the same time. Got that? Collect yourself! When will it be confirmed? Maybe next week I guess? The committee is called on this Friday. If she’s diagnosed as brain dead then what? Then the transplant will be proceeded, since the patient signed up to be a donor. It’s so ironic tho. Why? The male patient next to her in the same ward... The one has been treated with handcuffs. He is on the transplant list. What’s so ironic about that? Do you know that their blood types match for allograft? Oh... Really? I heard her liver will be transplanted to him. Oh, my God!
