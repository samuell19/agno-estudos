[WHAT IS IT, SAJI?] [We present to you, a newcomer Saint] Newspaper, Piles Ad, Bike flyer Bike flyer, Piles ad... Hey, the tea is not strong enough! Hey, please be careful! Annachi saw a big cobra yesterday. Perfect thing to say when stepping out in the dark! I think we have to make an offering to Saint George. I don't think this trouble with the snakes would end otherwise. I can make that money only if I do this job! I told you so that you won't end up in a coffin! Will there be snakes? Oh Saint George! [Illikkal Village Panchayat] Here you go! Oh no! Giriyetta! Oh no! Oh mother of God! Oh no! Oh my God! Oh mother of God! Move aside, Annachi! Oh God! I would have died now! Oh! Was there such a shortcut? Crap! Anyway, I saved 3/4th of a kilometer! His work got over so soon? Whatever I feed this cow, it doesn't give enough milk. It will be alright soon, Chechi. You've been saying this for a while now! I'm going to sell it after this lactation period. I'm fed up. I don't want to feed it any longer. Hey! You don't have to complain like this all the time. I'll sell it when it's only good for meat. I've been hearing this for a long time now. Hey! Did she wake up? No! This is my dad! He won't even allow me to sleep in the morning! He's jealous because he has to work in the morning. This is my Mom. It's Puttu today as well! A flying head? That's trouble coming for me! - Oh God! - That was a narrow escape! - Chechi. - What's it? - Isn't Thomas Chettan here? - Appa! - Yes, I saw them! - Where is that sound coming from? Oh, Appa! Didn't you open your shop today? Oh, it's you! What is it? Well, that thing discussed during last Sunday's Mass... - Holy Mass! - We came for that. This is... I forgot to introduce him. This is the new Junior Priest of our church. Oh! You are a priest? I didn't realize that. I'm not a priest yet. I'm in the process of becoming one. Hey, take them inside. Sit inside. I'll come after a wash. - Okay. - Come. There's just this one design for Achappam, right? That's true! - Your card for 'Family Unit'. - Okay. - Prayer book for Novena. - Okay. - Also, the notice for Novena. - Okay. - Receipt. - Here. Well, the Priest had told you specifically, right? - What? - A small donation for the church. A small donation, whatever you can. But it shouldn't be less than Rs. 2,000. Oh God, please make all the switches work! That small amount is enough. Here. Keep it safely. This is for registering in our Community Matrimony. Can you give me your daughter's name and details? Sure. Why not? Are there any fees for this service? What fees? This is for our community, right? Exactly why I asked that. If you could give your daughter's name and details... Sajimol Thomas... Maliyekkal House... Illikkal. She is part of this parish itself, right? Yes. This parish itself. Phone number? Hey dear, give them your number! - Your number is enough. - Oh, is that so? [Tells his phone number in Malayalam and English] - What? - Four, five. - What? - Four, five. Uncle... Do you have any other children? - This man! - Hey, listen! I have only one daughter. Well, the records say that it's her second marriage. Was she... married earlier? She got engaged once. But it got cancelled. Oh! That's it! After all, computers won't make mistakes. Don't worry, Thomas Chetta. The meeting for remarriages is coming soon. There, you will get fine grooms who were married once or twice! It will happen easily, without any demands from the groom's family. Moreover, since your daughter's engagement got cancelled, she is known as a spinster. You know how difficult it is to dump her on someone else's head now? - Isn't it, Priest? - Oh God! We're doomed! It's true, right? Get out from my house! Hey, calm down! - Let go of me! - Hey, it's a Priest! - Why should I care? - Stop there! - Coming into our house and saying rubbish! - Stop there, I say! - Let me go, Mom! - Hold tight! - Hey! - Go fast! - Stop there, Sajimol! The spinster will be in your house! Go, go, go! Has your anger subsided? Is it Puttu again, Mom? Yes. Don't eat all of it! - Dry tapioca would have been better! - She and her dry tapioca! Is this the way girls talk? That too, to a priest! - Oh Mother Mary! - Mom! - What is it? - Who plucked this Aloe Vera? Don't shout! Minnal squashed it in the morning. I didn't want to waste it. So I brought it here. Oh no! The glow on my face! You and your glow! You should go to the ration shop today, okay? If not, we will lose this month's supplies. - I'll go in the evening. - Okay. - Here. Do you want one more? - No. Here. Take this. What's this? - A newspaper came home. - A newspaper? What's this gratitude card for? It's for the Saint. I understood that. What blessing did you receive to make this? My son receieved a marriage proposal from a white woman in America. It came from their side. They are a wealthy family. It's all a blessing from the Saint! - He is your son, right? - Of course! So he must have gone behind that foreigner! Anyway, good! [humming a Malayalam song] Hey! You and your lightning speed! Get lost! Minnal, you just keep hanging out like this. There's only a week left for your wedding! - I'm the only one, right? - Yeah, yeah! I have to do everything on my own, right? Oh Saint! Please protect me! - Thanks, Bro! - Oh God! Is he on his way to get life support? These guys! Oh Saint! Please be with me! Rocky Bhai! Start the vehicle! Mini! Don't you have any trips? Move aside! - Are you taking revenge? - Hey, Minnal! Was it you who ran through our property this morning? Yes. Sajimol... I wasn't able to take the turn as I had expected. My Aloe Vera got destroyed. But it was not me! It was that turn, right? Turns will be curved, right? What's this? A new carrier! A new person is coming, right? So I got a new carrier. Isn't it good? Hey, don't forget the wedding date! I have told Thomas Chettan as well. Shall I leave, Mini? - Come here! I know I behaved badly to those who came to my house. I lost control when I heard what they said! What can I do? And on top of that, he was a priest! If he's a priest, he should wear his robe, right? How will I know if he comes wearing jeans and shirt? You're a spinster if you don't get married. The sky won't fall down if I don't marry, right? The problem is with some of the townsfolk. Well, whom am I saying all this to? - Oh Mother Mary, who helps Christians! - Please pray for us! - Oh Mother Mary, who helps Christians! - Please pray for us! - Oh Mother Mary, who helps Christians! - Please pray for us! Hey! Bible. Sirach 16:1 Hey, don't waste time! Sirach, Chapter 16, Holy verses starting from verse 1. Do not long for a brood of worthless children, and do not take pleasure in godless sons. Do not count on their having long life, do not put too much faith in their number. Amen. What? I don't have any hopes. Did you buy the kerosene? Well, I forgot to take the bottle. - Bottle! - When will you stop forgetting things? My daughter doesn't have any work over here, right? Then, what are you thinking about all the time? Bad upbringing! Minnal's wedding is on Thursday. He told me. I'm not going anyway. He has arranged a bus. All the jobless people in town will be there! Yes. All your friends will be there! Even he found a partner! There goes the power! Idukki dam must have run out of water. Why are you blaming Idukki? Oh Mother Mary! She has become such a nuisance! No brains whatsoever! This is the only good thing from that Spiritual Retreat. What? Blowing out the candle? Shouldn't we find another groom for her? When will it happen, my Saint? Don't disturb the Saint's peace of mind! ["Pranchiyettan and the Saint" playing on TV] Hey! Reduce the volume! Okay! [Vishnu weds Chithra] Phew! Oh Jesus! - Sajimol. - Yes. Even Minnal got married! Haven't you found a match yet? So many lightning strikes go to waste. Looks like even death doesn't want him. Get in. Where is she going? Drink it, dear. Show me your leg. Come on, show it to me. Now we have to bear its expenses as well! Seems like the collection has been great. Oh my Saint! Even Minnal got married! Well, I just reminded you. - Sajimol. - Yes. Why don't you donate something more than your regular 2 Rupees? - How come you didn't attend the wedding? - Well... A Parish clerk can only attend weddings and funerals in his own Parish. Is that illumination from America? Yes, of course! Well, visiting the chapel is not enough. You must visit the Church once in a while. By the way, if you are not planning to get married, why don't you choose the spiritual path? It's not that I don't plan to get married, Sister. I'm not getting good prospects. They won't give me peace of mind, even here! Sister, please come here. Well, you can ask her about anything except her wedding. I just asked her about it. - You did? - Yes. Amen! Sajimol, how come I didn't see you here for the past two days? It was Minnal's wedding, right? Why are you looking around? Oh! Are you enacting the scene from the movie, 'Pranchiyettan & the Saint'? Who is it? Hey! I'm here. Over here. From this shrine. Is it coming from there? Oh God! Sajimol! So, it was all true? Of course! Why else did you come here, all these years? Wow, this is... So, all this was for real? Oh! So, you were never a believer? What? I'm not a believer? I am a strong believer! Oh! So you can lie really well. Wow! Such wonderful laughter! And, what else is happening? Oh! Nothing much! Just going on, as usual. - Saint? - Yes. Do you talk to everyone like this? No. Only to those who are dear to me. So, it must be the Bishop, right? Hey, you are really something! Well, Saint... Do you talk to anyone else over here? Not here. A long time back, I spoke to a girl called Diana in France. Then, there was a Peter in Padua. So, there are a few. So, why are you talking to me? Hearing your complaints and sob stories, I felt sad. That's why. But I didn't say those out loud! You thought about it, right? That's enough. Saint, are you aware of everything that we think about? Most of it. Why? Nothing. Hey, someone is coming. Get going. Well, you'll be here tomorrow as well, right? Well, let me see. And, don't tell this to anyone. Okay. I'll see you later then. 2. Corinthians, Chapter 12, verse 14. What I want is not your possessions but you. Children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. - Amen. - Amen. Cute little Saint. Hello, Saint. What are you doing? What does Mom know? No shortage of backtalk! You should buy kerosene tomorrow. Whatever! It's good. Take it. Wait, let me check. - Sajimol. - Yes. We've got some good banana saplings. Please inform Thomas Chettan. Oh, what's there to inform? There's no use in planting it, adding fertilizers and taking care of it. It will all be gone if a strong wind blows before harvest! If you use that time to do some other job, you can at least make some money. Isn't it, Madhu Chetta? Shall I pack it? Wait, let me think about it. Sigh! - Saint? - Yes? Oh, you were here? Where can I go? Hey, don't you have anything to pray for? People come here with hundreds of problems. Saint... I had a doubt whether what happened yesterday was real. So, I tried shaking the small figurine of yours that I had at home. It didn't work! Is this the minimum size required for you to talk? You're too much! Saint... The people who pray to you... Do they actually receive blessings? What a question! So many people receive blessings! Okay. So, how does that work? Sajimol... I'm just a middleman. Huh? So, you are not a God? Yeah, right! So, you've also assumed the same? So, who are you really? My dear Sajimol... I present your prayers to God. If the purpose of your prayer is meant for your good, God will make it happen. Oh! Why are you switching on the AC now? The Priest wants to pray for half an hour. How come you're early today? Okay then. Carry on. Okay. Hey... There's a song that the Priest sings! It's unbearable! That's funny! I'm leaving, Saint. We can't talk once the priest is here, right? Saint? What? Can we meet in person? You don't believe me yet? - Well, it's not that. - Then? I don't like this. It's like talking to a radio! If we could meet in person, it would be great. There are some procedures for that. What are those? First, you attend the Church mass and offer prayers, cleanse your mind of the jealousy, envy and gossip in it, and come back after that. We will meet after that. - Saint? - What? - Attending the mass is fine. - Okay. But your second instruction is a little difficult. Why? Whatever I see, I do feel certain jealousy and envy within me. Yes, I know that. That's why I said so. Well, instead of that... just like lent... I can avoid meat and fish. What say? But vegetarian food is what I like the most. So, if I sacrifice that? Is there such an option? Is this "Who wants to be a millionaire?" to give you options? Okay. Forget that, Saint. I'll tell you the best option. I'll buy umbrellas for ten poor people. Or forget that. How about books... or school uniforms? - Would that be okay? - Hey, that's enough! You don't have to do anything. Just attend the mass and come here. Oh dear Jesus! - Okay then. - Okay. - Sajimol. - Yes. I am telling you again. No one else should know about this deal of ours! If that happens, I'll stop this. Okay, Saint. It's hanging over the church roof. Let's do this. Let's not cut down the coconut tree. 'A tree is a blessing', right? Let's renovate the roof. We have to form a new committee for that. Hello. Hello? He's gone! - Father. - Yes. Don't you play badminton any more? My waistline has become smaller. So, I stopped playing. Oh! So you've quit, Father? No. He stopped the whole game in the church. Yes, that's it. You just have to take me home! Hey! Can you please start this vehicle? - This guy! - He is a poor chap, Father. Poor chap? Who? This guy? Do you know what he asked me on the 1st of this month? - What? - To give him half a litre, if I have stock - What? - Wine! Wine from the church is very potent, it seems. Yes. That reminds me... We've run out of wine. What? It wasn't me. Hey! Can't you throw that junk away and buy a new one? I don't get money when I make a call, Father. Then, do this. Come and pray for 30 minutes. No, Father! I have to leave early. Hey! I'm going to sing today. That's exactly why! Come! Baby Chetta... - Aren't you going for the mass? - No. [singing prayer] [singing in Mass] [indistinct chatter] The meeting is on Wednesday, right? - Father is coming. - Where is your robe? Hey, Saji! How come you are here? That's quite unusual. Nothing. Just a casual visit. Well, has your wedding been fixed? Wedding? No, Father. I just came to see the mass. What? To see the mass? Is it a theater play for you to see? Hey, it is "to offer mass"! - Yes, yes. - Understood? Well, Father... There is a funeral at 11 a.m. Oh no! And there is a wedding at 12 p.m. Saint. Saint. What is it? I attended mass, just like you said. Is it so? Good. So, how's it going to be? Can I see you now? Do we have to do this today? It got pretty late when I slept yesterday after the night prayers. Saint! Okay. Wow! Oh my! Wow! Nice material! Where did you buy this from? The embroidery is amazing! Where did you get this done? Oh Jesus, it was foolish to appear in front of her! You do look stylish! What is this, Saint? Did you get it as a gift? Stop it! This is a medicine pouch. Oh, so you practice traditional medicine? I have to survive, right? Saint, is this gold? Yes. Wow! So much gold? Lower your voice! Someone will hear you. Is it 916 Gold? What all do you want to know? Well, for how long have you been here? Maybe around hundred years now. So, you didn't get any transfer in between? Instead of asking such foolish questions, tell me what's happening in your life. Oh, what's there to say? I don't feel good. What happened? Any financial trouble? No. Any health issue? No. Lost peace of mind? No. But no one values me at home. Why so? Don't you do any work? Dad and Mom are totally fine. They are very healthy even now. So, my dear girl is just chilling at home, eating and drinking, right? You too, Saint? Well, when you get food without any difficulty, you will feel like this! I didn't understand, Saint. Frankly speaking, you've been spoiled rotten! Oh, you were the only one left to say so! Well, last day when I brought some banana saplings in front of you, you got so annoyed! Forget that. What happened to your teaching job? Rs. 30 Lakhs. We have to pay 30 lakhs to get a job. If I had that much money, I can deposit it in some bank, right? Then, what about the government job exam? Yeah, right! That's when the lauded marriage proposal came, right? So? When we reached home after the engagement, there was a discussion regarding my wedding dress. Mother-in-law said that I should wear a Saree. But I wanted to wear a gown. Then, mother-in-law asked me, "What's wrong with Saree?" I said, "You are not the bride, right? I'm the bride!". Then they... That's enough. I understood. That's how it got cancelled. Didn't the groom say anything? He said, "Come, Mom. Let's go!". Saint... Even when they negotiate the price for buffaloes in markets, they do it under a towel wrapped around their hands! It's good that you responded like that then. So, I've become an outspoken, arrogant girl at home, and in front of everyone else. And now they say I've become a spinster! Sajimol, everything happens for the good! Believe that your good days are coming! Well, you've decided not to get married, right? Is it a firm decision? Nothing like that. If I get married, I should be very happy... and the wedding should be conducted in the Church. I'll pray for that. Saint... Why don't you perform a miracle and get me a good life? Well, you don't have to hurry. Take your time. Get going, Saji. I'm tired from not getting enough sleep. Contractor Benny sponsored last night's prayer. They laid tiles all over town... and came complaining that there's no water! I'm leaving then! Okay. Saint... Is there no chance for a miracle? The miracle for you... Genesis 3:19. Mom! Mom! Mom! - Mom! Sapling! - What? - Banana sapling! - Yes. Dad bought the saplings. What happened? Well, I was going to inform him. What? Sapling... To buy it... Banana sapling is not the miracle. The miracle for you... Genesis 3:19. "By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread," "till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken;" "for you are dust, and to dust you shall return." Huh? "By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread," "till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken;" "for you are dust, and to dust you shall return." Oh!

I made a brief appearance there and then left. Why just a brief appearance? Another girl came wearing the same saree! Oh, was that the problem? It wasn't just that.

Kunjukunje, it's in the center of the chapel. Check whether your house name is correct "Kunjukunju (NRI) Puthanpuraykkal" It's correct, Father. Now, put a Rs. 2,000 note in that box. You parish clerk! Another 2,000 is gone! You shouldn't be the only happy one, right? This is an intimate book, Father. - Intimate book? - This is his autobiography, Father! Sheesh! I'm not saying this just because he's my younger brother. His autobiography should be in all the houses in our Parish. - That is his wish. - Yes, Father. If you'd help him... Let's not confine it to our Parish. Let's plan to distribute it in the entire Diocese! You are still in the petroleum business, right? You must be making great profits, right? We'll think about it. Okay? He might smash his brother's head! Come, Father. Will you read it, Father? Who will read this autobiography? Throw it away! Hey, I didn't see you in the Family Unit meeting! Listen, you are still unmarried. - Don't forget that! - Okay, Father. Hey, go and throw it somewhere! Huh? Saint! What is it? Nowadays, walking around in the chapel... has become like a "Snake & Ladder" game! All this is for you, right? There are six donation boxes now, including this one! It's convenient now, right? Don't say that! I'll be sapped by the time I go to bed after counting all these. But this is nothing compared to what some churches have built. Instead of all that squandering, if they build houses for ten people, the prayers that emerge from those houses... will be much more beautiful than the prayers that come from this church. So, isn't Jesus seeing any of this? I think Jesus will have to come down once again with a whip. He chased away the shopkeepers from the temple in Jerusalem, right? Just like that. Hey, Saint... I came here to thank you. For my change. Saji, everything was right in front of you. You opened your eyes and saw it only now. That's all. Even then, Saint... You made it happen, right? Then, do this. Instead of your 2 Rupees, put Rs. 500 in the donation box. Oh, you're so funny! Okay then, Saji. You get going. I have to sleep early. I'm going for a trip tomorrow. What? A trip? Well, that... St.Francis, St. Sebastian and I... are going for a one day trip. Okay, okay. Carry on. Saint... Be careful. Don't wander here and there. You should return to the chapel before dusk. Hey. Pick a verse from the verse box on your way out. And attend the mass tomorrow.

Please don't break my stick! Phew! Here, take your stick! Thanks. Didn't he say anything else? No. Is that so? Seeing your show-off, I thought... you moved a mountain or something! Well, forget all that. Who is this Roy? Has he come here? No. - Hey, Saint. - Yes. This Roy and I... used to sing together at the church long ago. Oh, you used to sing? Yes, a little bit. Oh! A good time with church, singing and all. Is that such a big deal? Did he like you? It was not like that. Then, how was it? Not 'He'... It was 'She' who used to like... Oh! I liked Roy. That's interesting. And then? Then what? Well, he never knew about it! For that, I had to tell him, right? Were you always this crazy? Get lost, Saint! I was scared. Back then, boys used to come to us to propose, right? Girls have started changing only recently, right? So, you're still blaming him. Then, how come you never told him until now? He was roaming around the world with his tutoring. I'll tell you something else. There is only one other person besides me who knows that I like him. Who is that person? You are that person! Oh, Jesus! Will this chapel become a love nest? - I'm leaving, Saint. - Okay. Saint, can you give me this pouch? For what? It looks cool. I'll hang it on my bag. Get going! You'll only give it if Diana asks, won't you? Sajimol! How are you? Why did you leave so quickly yesterday? - Were you busy? - Yes. Been a while since we met, right? - What's happening? - Nothing much. Just going on, as usual. Where are you based now, Roy? You don't come here often, right? I'm in Bangalore now... with some work. What work? Well, my work is.... Smuggling! Huh? I teach some children... and do some travelling as well. Has your family come along with you? My family hasn't come. Oh! Why so? I don't have a family yet! What's new with you? Nothing much, Roy. Going on with the grace of the Saint. Not that! Your wedding... Is it over? No. Didn't find the right match yet. Oh, okay. You haven't given up singing yet, right? I heard you in the church. Do you sing now, Sajimol? Oh! I stopped it long back. Now I do some bottle art and stuff like that. Come to the church some time. Let's hang out, listening to some old songs. Okay. I'll try. Okay then. I'm going to the church. Father called me. He wants me to help in making a float for the Easter celebration. Okay. You look good, Sajimol. Hey, what kind of a bill is this? You shouldn't fool poor people like this. Oh sure, Father, you're just the perfect person to tell me that! Don't talk like this, supporting Satan! - Saji! - Yes, Father. Roy told me that you used to sing earlier. That was long ago, Father. Why didn't you tell me about it? Do this. Everyone is there. Go over there. Saint! Saint! What is it? What is this, Saint? What happened? Stop it! I asked you what this is! Tell me the matter. I fell down near the school. Are you laughing? We're so close now. You shouldn't have done this to me. Hey! Isn't that Saint George? Two Saint Georges? Wow! You have excellent eyesight! Just a small mistake! - Got it? - Look. - Let's go. - Are you in the circus? No way! We are riders. Bike riders. We heard that biker riders would get protection if we pray to this Saint. Is it? You have come to the right place! You will get great protection. Okay then. Shall we go to Chathanpara? Poor kids! I hope at least their lives are spared, my Sain... ... my Jesus! Saji. - Hey! - Yes. Does it hurt? Just a stinging pain. Let me see. What was your speed when you fell down near the school? Around 60 km/hr... maximum. There's a hump over there. - Did you see it? - No. Oh! If you were riding properly, you would have seen that hump... and reduced your speed. You weren't looking and you fell down. And you're blaming me? Roy cheated me. When? No, not like that. When I went to the church, he was flirting with some girls there. So what? So... crap! Talk to me instead of getting angry. I got angry when I saw it and I took off in high speed. But you've given my life only so much value, huh? I understood. Hey, do you know how hard it was for me... to steer away an goods truck that was coming up behind you... while you were lying over there? - Is it true? - Of course! You can trust him. My dear Kunjacha, please don't be so angry! It's for our parish, right? I just asked, right? [Indistinct chatter] Silence! I'll tell you later. Don't you want the blessings of the Saint, Kunjacha? Okay, okay. It's not for me. I'm begging for the parish. Well, this year's... Easter celebration should be grand! I'm adamant about it. Father, shall we bring a DJ? Yes. We's ask a DJ to accompany Jesus on the cross! It's a good idea! Then shall we arrange a group song... by the male and female associations? It'll be very good. Baby, Jesus has to resurrect on the third day. Will you obstruct it? Let's do this. I'll give an idea. Well, it must the Bible play, as always! Isn't it, Father? No. The other day, Augustin's son Roy had come to meet me. He told me one thing. He told me about... recreating Passion of the Christ & his crucifixion on stage, with participation from all parish members. I found it very interesting when I heard it. But we need a Jesus for that. I can play Jesus, Father. Okay, the cross is ready. Now, we need a Jesus. So let's all work together... and make this a grand celebration. Okay? To accomplish that, I'll let you know about each of your responsibilities. I'll ask Father... and let you know. Okay? - Isn't it enough, Father? - Yes. - Sajimol. - Yes. You are a girl with great artistic sense, right? So you should find a good Jesus. - Isn't it, Father? - Yes. Okay. Then, Father John and the deacon will do the rest. I'll take care of the fund collection. Spending money is not an issue at all. But the other parishes should be shocked seeing our celebration. They will be shocked! I'm also going to call Kunjukunju. Let him also be shocked! So, there's nothing else, right? Okay then. Let's disperse. - You'll do the rest of the things, right? - Yes. - Sajimol! - Yes. Well, we need a good Jesus. These guys won't be able to find one. You should do the needful. - Let me try, Father. - Okay. And, once you find the Jesus, click a photo and send it to Roy. This was his idea, right? Okay then. Baby, one important thing you have to do... is to check if the fish fry is ready! Jesus! Forgive me, Mother Mary! Who is this? I'm Sajimol. What is it, Sajimol? Tell me. I have sent a couple of Jesuses. - Jesuses? No. I have sent photos of some Jesuses Can you check those and tell me? Okay. Can you hold? I'll check and tell you. - Okay. Are these Jesuses or the culprits in a narcotics case? I felt the same way too. It would be better to check other options. Saji Chechi, did you find your Jesus? No. What happened to your IELTS exam? I couldn't crack it. - I'm leaving, Okay? - Okay. Janet, can we get a black belt in 2 days? Hey, should we wait or leave? Well, you can leave. I took leave today for nothing! Saint, show me a way!

From where did you find him? Rajan Nair! Sajimol Thomas! Father, he is not an ordinary Jesus. He is a Jesus from an upper caste Hindu family! Jesus born in a good family! That's great, right? Saint, the programme was a huge success! Also, I put up my page's advertisement along with it. So, I got a couple of orders from abroad. Superb! So, you've also turned me into a commodity! It's not like that, Saint. It is a matter of survival, right? What's happening between you and Roy? Will that boat ever wash ashore? Maybe... it might happen. Make yourself clear. What's there to say? I think Roy would have realized it by now. And, we were together all these days, right? What should I do next, Saint? Sajimol, this is a second chance. Had you opened your mouth sooner, I would've been listening to your children's prayers now. But Saint... when a girl proposes to a boy... You consider yourself as a girl. I consider all of you as humans! I should tell him, right? Saji, talking straight from the heart... brings two hearts together... and dissolves all problems. So, you go ahead. Go ahead and open up your heart to him. You could have given that bell to him, right? Let him learn to ring it. No need, Father. He wants to become a Priest. Let him have a good life, at least. Well, becoming a Priest is a noble act, right? In that case, it's okay. Roy. Oh! You were here? How are you? Are there only two people inside this? Well... Are there only two people inside this? Yes. Why? Our family graves are overcrowded. Is it a bus or what? Nice ambience, right? Nice ambience, indeed. The mundu with a silver border that you wore, day before yesterday... was awesome! - Really? - Yes. I'll tell Dad. It's his Mundu. Did you come here to tell me this? - No. - Then? My parents are very adamant... that I should get married. Oh! Finally, I agreed. Will you be there for my wedding? Well, you have to be there, right? Oh! Have you come to invite me to your wedding? Where is the groom from? Oh no! Well, Roy... Do you know what I was planning to tell you? That... that... Our... that... - That? - No. Not that. Like this... Like what? My dear Roy... Can you please tell me how to express my love to someone? Just tell him on his face that you love him. In that case... I love you. I love you. Well, you didn't give me a reply! Are you feeling shy? Sajimol, when you propose, give him a flower, and do it with full confidence. Roy! One minute. I'll be back. Gospel of Luke. Chapter 2, Verse 35. "So that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed." "And a sword will pierce your own soul too." That girl was suggested as a potential marriage partner for me by my uncle. Annie. She is settled in America. She will return soon. She came to tell me that. What happened? Your face changed all of a sudden! It was my uncle who suggested it, right? But the decision will be mine. Won't you marry her if your uncle asks you? Should I? While proposing your love, you should at least bring a flower, right? Well, I had it with me. I took it from a funeral wreath! From a funeral wreath? Well... since I was in a hurry. This is the first time I have received... a flower from a funeral wreath during a proposal! Nice! You didn't accept it yet. You didn't give it yet! ♪ Appearing before my eyes like a misty blue lotus ♪ ♪ Who might you be? ♪ ♪ You entwine my heart, like a breath ♪ ♪ Melodies stir, enduring as eternity ♪ ♪ As we adorn ourselves in the moonlight of our dreams ♪ ♪ You stitched hues as if feathers ♪ ♪ You rained music like a cloud ♪ - Shall we click a selfie? - Why not?

I've brought a promising proposal for you, Sajimol. He is a government employee, living in Ernakulam. Though this is his 2nd marriage, he doesn't look like he has a child. Look at this photo. Superb, right? - He has only one child now, right? - Yes.

Well, when are you returning to Bangalore? Next week. Do you want to come along? It's because you keep waiting for everyone's permission. Or else, you could have come along with me. Roy, it's just a proposal for now. Even that is still pending! Yes, we were discussing that. Roy... Don't be so complacent. Please be more proactive. - We are praying for you both. - Okay. Sister, could you please pray with more fervor? Because the Priest had brought this proposal, I refrained from objecting to it. How can we go against the Priest? Listen, brother... Just because the Priest said so, can we agree to it? I'm trying to get Annie's proposal back on track over here. Don't worry. I know a way to handle it. And we should consider our family's status as well, right? Of course! Status should be considered. Yes, yes. What I've invested in the wedding market for my two daughters, is not a meagre amount. - I've invested around 1.5 crores! - I know that. I should at least get 2 Crores back, including interest. You must! Even if it is Annie, whom you reccommended, or someone else! I'll take care of it, Brother. Then... my "Kunjukunju's autobiography". Did you finish distributing it, brother? - I did it long back, right? - Is it? I get goosebumps when I read it. Our legacy, our forefathers, our nobility... Hello? Hey, I'm unable to hear anything. Brother, that awful foreigner defecated again! Okay then. You go and take care of it. - Okay. - Okay then. It has gears! - Take your hand off. - Okay. - Go slowly. Okay? - Okay, Dad. - Hello Baby Chetta. - Yes. How are you? You are flourishing nowadays! Is it black magic? Please give us a tip. She thinks she is a big shot. She charmed Roy, right? You should always aim for the topmost branch, right? That's what! I don't understand something. How did Augustin agree to it? That too, this spinster! Yes, yes. Don't these people have no other job? How will I read and understand all this? These are the requests from Minnal. Someone stole his bicycle. If you have some extra money, please buy him a bicycle. I will do it, Saint. Why do you seem dull? Is it because of what they are saying outside? When I heard all that, I feel that marriage may remain just a wish... Are you so scared? No way! Scared? Not at all. I am scared, Saint. Why are you being scared? I am with you, right? Your families are meeting on Monday, right? Yes. Attend the morning mass that day and then come here. I will do something for you. Your wedding will happen without any obstacles. [Priest chanting in church mass] Why did you want to meet me urgently, dear? Whenever Kunjukunju calls, he keeps talking about you, Annie. Anyway, good that I thought of coming home during this vacation. I feel Roy is more comfortable here. It's not a feeling. It's true. What are you trying to say, dear? Roy doesn't want to leave this town, this church, or his singing behind. And, I should be understanding that, right? Anyway, this decision of mine... will make both Roy and me happy in the future. So Uncle, I will be going back soon. Okay then. Shall I leave? Saint. Saint! Saint! Did you remove that 2 sovereigns gold chain... donated by Kunjayippu from the Saint's statue? Yes, Father. - Who must have done this? - What happened here? The two donation boxes...? Who did this? The donation boxes are intact. It's there, Father. Check everywhere, Father. They even took the Saint's spear! Fine. It's still heavy. Check over there! Check everywhere! Jesus' stick is safe. How is that possible? There are thieves everywhere nowadays. We have to file a complaint at the police station. How will we know what all were stolen? [indistinct chatter] Silence! No need to worry. Nothing expensive has been stolen. Only the Saint's statue has been stolen. Anyway, I have to inform the Bishop House. We have to check if anything else was stolen. Okay? Who must have stolen the Saint, my God? It was my Saint that got stolen! Your Saint? The person who stole it must have some connection to the chapel. I'm sure of that. Some time back, Mini, the auto rickshaw driver... asked me how old the Saint is! - Is it? - Yeah, right! Just because she asked that, doesn't mean she would steal it, right? Leave it. Let's inform the police, anyway. Let them investigate. Will it be some terrorists? Will it be Monson Mlavunkal? It's so nice! We have informed the police. - It will happen. - Here comes Thomas Chettan. Yes, Thomacha. Well, we are all mourning the theft of our Saint, right? Let's postpone that family meeting for the time being. Okay. Then, let's go to the police station for the remaining procedures. Yes, let's go. Sajimol! Wow! Such wonderful laughter! Do you talk to everyone like this? No. Only to those who are dear to me. Sajimol, Pick a verse from the verse box on your way out. It's for your own good. Why are you getting scared? I am with you, right? Your families are meeting on Monday, right? - Yes. - I will do something for you. Your wedding will happen without any obstacles. Only my candle should be here. Cleetus! Yes? Hey, Cleetus! Oh it was you, Father! Well, the Saint will come day after tomorrow. Oh, you got him? We got a call from the Bishop House. We have to place the new Saint in the glass case, as soon as possible. The Bishop will come to bless the ceremony. So, we thought of doing it on the Saint's Novena day itself. Okay. Let it be. - Father. - Yes. I mentioned the theft of the Saint's statue to my son. Then, he expressed his interest... In what? To sponsor the new statue of the Saint. You should have said that earlier. Do this. Go to the church office, pay the money and get the receipt. - Well, Father... - Yes. He sponsored the glass case, right? That's why your names are engraved on it, right? Yes, yes. He has one more small wish. What is the next wish? Well, since he is sponsoring the new Saint as well, can you hang our family name on the Saint's stick? Think about it. Not on the Saint's stick, but on the Saint's... No need! - Leave, Cleetus! - I understood. Maybe some other time! Hey, start the vehicle! Has he carved his name on the candle? Father! Come fast! - What's there? - What is it? Praise the Lord! They are the old, banned currency notes. What can we do with it? How much is it? The old notes would amount to 1.5 Lakhs. And this? This would be 2 Lakhs worth new notes. So, we've lost 1.5 Lakhs. We have to file a complaint with the police, Father. For what, Sabu? Our church got this money, right? When I asked you to install CCTV, church committee opposed it saying that it will increase expenses! Well, Father... What if this was taken from the donation box at several intervals? Father... I suspect... the parish clerk! Why? He recently bought a bicycle for this son. How can a parish clerk with a salary of Rs. 6,000 buy that expensive bicycle? In that case, I can doubt you as well, right? What kind of talk is that, Father? Our family is not that desperate, to steal from the Church. You just sit here trusting everyone, Father! I'm leaving! - Augustin! - I'm coming with you. What a pathetic situation! Oh, here he is! You will live for a hundred years! We were just talking about you. Okay then. We're leaving. New bicycle! [Dialogues from the movie, "Lelam"] "They are still wiggling in front of my eyes, Father!" "Worms, this big, from my dad's nose and mouth!" "That day, priests in robes like this one... " "covered their noses in front of my Dad's dead body... " My dear people, following the humble path paved by the holy Saint Rocky, the Saint who patiently made his life a guide for everyone in times of penury. Let God bless us so that we may follow the Saint's path... by giving what we have to the poor. - It's so stylish, right? - Yes. It must be worth at least 50 lakhs, right? No way! It will be at least 1.5 crores. - Is it so? - Even this circle is worth a lot! It is good if the Saint gets stolen once in a while! - Why? - Look, a lot of money is coming in! Everyone left. Saint. Saint! Saint! What was all that? Couldn't you tell me before leaving? The stress I went through! Oh Saint, please stop my husband's boozing! Didn't you hear what I said? Oh! Now you don't need me since the Bishop came, right? It's me! It's Sajimol! Can you please show your face? Another snag! Oh Saint, make me win the lottery this time! Saint. Saint! Saint! Saint... I think the Saint does not exist, Saji! I devoted my entire life to the church and the Saint. If he is for real, how could anyone accuse me of theft like this? It's the case of the stolen Saint. They called from the church... saying that you both were loitering over there in a suspicious manner. So, we have to enquire about it, right? Tell me. Why did you steal it? What's the matter? We didn't steal the Saint's statue, Sir. Please don't say unholy things. Oh, I should not say it! But you can do it, right? My dear Sir, we haven't done anything. You can leave now. We will call you again if we have any further doubts. Come. Come fast. They will put us in jail if we stay any longer here! Sir. Yes. Sit. Sir, is there any way to get the old Saint back? Great! The Saint's case again? My dear sister, there are 1,500 cases here. With all those, we don't have much time for this Saint's case. Moreover, the new Saint has arrived, right? Yes. So, we won't get it back? Are you a believer? Yes. Then, take out the Bible and pray firmly. Okay? Okay then. Okay. So, you've abandoned me in the end, right? Saint? Saint! Saint! Oh, it was Dad! - Oh! - What is it? - You are boozing secretly, right? - Yes. Why is your face so gloomy? It's nothing. Then? Well, Dad... I'm quite sad ever since the Saint got stolen. Oh. But they have placed a new Saint, right? What's wrong now? Yet, I feel sad, Dad. Maybe it's because I have been seeing that Saint from childhood. Okay. That's true. You will feel sad. The Saint is the one who brought you into our lives. While your mother was on her eighth month, the doctor said that... we won't get this child. I went to the chapel, kneeled in front of the Saint and prayed. The Saint delivered you to us without any problems. You will feel sad when that Saint is gone. I am sad, Dad. When I feel sad, I take out the Bible and read it. That's how I learned the verses by heart. Did you have plenty of woes back then? Yes. It was after you were born... that I learned many verses! Oh! It's good to talk like this, once in a while. This open conversation. Correct! This is the perfect time to talk! At midnight! Get up and leave! Go and sleep. When I feel sad, I take out the Bible and read it. Behold, I send an Angel before you. He will guard you along your way. Behold, I send an Angel before you. He will guard you along your way. He will bring you to the place I have prepared. Exodus Chapter 23, Verse 20 [Saint Rocky reciting different verses from the Bible] Sajimol! I'm telling you once again. No one else should know about this deal of ours. If that happens, I'll stop this. Even the police have washed their hands off this case. Where will we search for the Saint? You want to search right during the time when I'd get a lot of trips. Let's try. Will it be of any use? Yes, it will. Will you stand by me? I will if it doesn't cost me money! You don't have to do it half-heartedly. If the Saint is not found, you will be called a thief till you die. I will stand by you. Okay. Saint, what happened? Well, what can I say, Saji? When I got some free time, I went to check the roadside donation box. A 'good' guy who came on a bike... threw a five rupee coin! It hit directly on my head! Saint, please grant that lady's wish. Can all the wishes be granted, Saji? - Look at that girl standing over there. - That one? She has received a good marriage proposal from America. This lady is vehemently praying for that alliance to get cancelled! Oh my! Now tell me. Should I make it happen or not? Then, you should teach her a lesson, Saint! Make that girl's wedding happen! Yeah, right! This girl has five other lovers besides him! She is praying that she should get married to the first guy among them... who goes to America! Where is our society heading? Look at her go! Mini, is there a way to get an old statue of the Saint? Go and ask your uncle! - He is very old, right? - This is what I said. Your bad name won't get cleared until we get the Saint back! Well, it's very hot. We have to buy two more ACs. We will arrange that tomorrow itself, Father. Hey, at least get me that emblem. - How are things, Cleetus? - One minute. I was planning to meet you. - I want to book our auditorium. - For what? My son is getting married next December. Oh! How many guests will be there? There will be at least 4,500 guests. That only covers the near and dear ones. That's very less, Cleetus! Why don't you include some more people? - Is it so? - Yes. There is time, right? Let me think again. Oh dear Jesus! You could have given him some brains along with wealth! Its alignment is not right. It's your alignment which is not right! Here comes our Mini! Look! Everyone's gaze, including the Father's, changed! This is what I said. They will suspect everyone like this if the Saint is not found. Hey, we have to find our Saint. - Oh, what happened? - The new Saint got stolen? Not that! I meant the old Saint. We have to see if we can catch the thieves as well. Sajimol, in that case... can you please find my missing bicycle as well? Hey, she will stand by me. Will you also stand by me? Done! I'm also donating Rs. 50. Done! - Take your hand! - Thanks, Bro. - Oh my God! - I'll catch you one day! We have to throw something at him and make him fall! Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life." "No one comes to the Father except through me." Hey! Huh? Are you participating in Bible Quiz Contest? No, Dad. I'm just reading it. She is up to something! Saint! What is it? I was just starting to enjoy it. What are you doing? Which language is this? Don't you know my language? I don't know. Do you know which country I am from? No. I will tell you. The story of how I attained sainthood. If it's a long story, you can tell me later. Stop kidding. It's a small story. At Montpellier in France, I was the son of a governor from a wealthy family. My parents died when I was twenty years old. I donated all my wealth and travelled to Italy. On the way, there was a village affected by the plague. I got down there and did whatever I could to help them. The village was saved from the plague. But I got infected with that disease. The villagers drove me out of their village. Hugo was the one who came to save me. He cleaned my wounds by licking them. What? Hugo, my puppy. He bit a piece of bread and brought it to me. He brought water. So, under his care... I came back to life. When I was 32 years old, I returned home. However, nobody there recognized us. They imprisoned me, mistaking me for a spy. That's how I succumbed to death. God gave me this job. And now, the Saint Rocky who's sitting beside you and talking to you. That's me. That's my story. - Saint. - Yes. What happened to that dog? Oh, great! Are you more concerned about the dog after hearing my story? It's not that, Saint. What happened to that dog? Hugo. Isn't he the one you took home to take care of? Hugo! Hugo. Hugo. Where did he go? Hey, my dog is missing. Missing? It's their mating season, right? It will roam around somewhere and return. But do they have mating season in France? What? Nothing. - Let me know if you see him anywhere. - Okay. Any update on the Saint? That reminds me. When I went for a trip today morning, I saw two guys speeding on a bicycle. I sensed something was wrong when I saw it. Did you recognize who they were? I couldn't get a good look... because they were going down a slope. If they were on a bicycle, they must be from around here, right? Yes. Sajimol, I'm very grateful to you for buying me this bicycle. But it's not very fast! I'm going to give it to Annachi. That's because of the gears! Hey, don't teach me about bicycles! It's faulty! - It's faulty. - Then get going! Are you coming, Sajimol? Let's go and have pepper juice. It's just a kilometer away. Just leave. I don't want your pepper juice. Come on! It's just one kilometer, right? Please leave, Minnal! We are stressed out here and you're thinking of pepper juice! Fine then! If someone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Matthew 5:41 Pepper is not as spicy as it used to be! It's all duplicate pepper now! Is it enough if you keep drinking this juice? Where is she going? It's two kilometers now. Village Well! Sajimol, we heard that your wedding is fixed! - Yes. - You are a smart girl. In the end, you managed to grab the topmost branch! She is something else! Come, let's go. What can we say about girls like this? There's a good vibe there. We should go there sometime. Hey, how are you? What happened? Did you fall off the motorbike while doing acrobatics? Oh, what's there to say? We just slipped a little. Is that so? - Okay then. We're leaving. - Okay. - Go carefully. - Okay. - Let's go. - Okay. - There is something cool in Kakkochippara. - What is it? GPay Rs. 20, if you have. I have Rs. 30. We will fill up petrol and head there! I will send it. Hello. Hey Mini. Hey! If you are going anywhere near the Village Well, make sure to double-check, okay? Double-check? Check what? Are you suggesting that I should search for clues? Clue? Yes. Similar to clues in mystery novels! - Okay. I'll check. - Okay. Hey, we have to talk to them about the wedding, right? What is there to talk? The two families didn't even meet formally. Oh, both of you started again! It's just that the priest brought this proposal. People are saying that... she and her Dad have something to do with the Saint's theft! What are you saying, Dad? Saji Chechi isn't that type of person. Hey! Don't make me open my mouth! She is an arrogant girl in front of the church and the townsfolk. Also, this is her second marriage. I don't want my son to marry that spinster! Saint, I can't even share my sorrows with anyone now. - Hello. - Where are you these days? There is no news from you! Are you busy? No, I'm not busy. Don't get stressed thinking about the situation here. I will manage that. Also, in order to live with me, I won't insist on having a formal family meeting. No, Roy. The wedding should happen formally. That's a small desire of mine. Then, so be it! Okay? Okay? Okay then. Good night. Okay then. Hey Saji, if we ask the new saint to retrieve the old Saint, will anything happen? - I didn't see you in the morning! - I have lots of work, Annachi. I should get time, right? - Is that so? - Yes. Annachi! Can you please switch off this song, Annachi? Same sound of the pedal! Annachi, you thief! See you in the evening! Why didn't you stop your scooter when I called, Sajimol? I would have paid for the lemon juice. - Pepper juice. - Saji! Got him! I got the thief! Annachi is the thief! Didn't I mention seeing a bicycle that morning? Yes, but you didn't see his face, right? That's true. But I heard the rattling sound of the pedal, right? - Sound? - The rattling sound of the pedal! If you think so... - What if I think so? - Then what? Let's grab Annachi! - Let's grab him! - Start your scooter! To grab Annachi? I'll also grab him! We saw Annachi on the way, right? Well, we could have stopped Annachi on the way, right? That would have been enough. I got very excited about this clue and rushed over here. Heard that? Do you hear the sound of the bicycle? [singing an old Tamil song] Annachi. Hello Minnal. Yes. Is this your own bicycle? No, this came for repair. Did they give their phone number? I don't do that normally. I told them to come in the morning. Is there any problem? Problem? No! There is no problem. We came to ask if they have plans to sell this bicycle. - At what time will you open tomorrow? - 9 a.m. Okay. Minnal, your bicycle is repaired. Look at it. How is it? Now it looks cool! Great job, Annachi! Great job! You've inflated the tires, right? Of course! - Sajimol. - Yes. If we are fortunate, we will find the Saint tomorrow. Or else, we might find the thieves! - Hello. - What is it, Mini? I am near the village well. Okay. Did you find any clue? That... There is no problem if you see us bathing! It's a big problem if we see women bathing! Hello? Is anything there? Yes. Me and two dogs! Two dogs? Hey, is this your dog? A white dog with black marks. Is he over there? You go after him and catch him! Hell no! It will bite me! Then, you wait there. I'll come. Okay. There it goes! You don't have to come. The dog ran away! Get lost, you dog! My dear Saint! Show kindness to my master. See, I am standing beside this well, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. Genesis 24:13 Hey, we have to check near that well. Hey, stop! - My dog! Where is she going? Hey, you go that way. I'll go this way. What? Go any way you want! Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path... through the vineyards, with walls on both sides. Numbers 22:24 Stop, stop! What happened to her? Sajimol! Where are you going? - Come, come! - Run, run! You go that way! There was no use in running! - Did you see him? - Yes. Go on. Go! - I am from a good family. - Did you get him? That dog! What is this, Hugo? Verse... Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem. Psalms 122:2 Don't say anything! - My Saint... - Get out of the way! - Give me my Saint, you thief! - Come! Run! - Come, Mini! - There they go! Run! - Minnal! - What? No point in running. We won't get them. Let's take the auto rickshaw. Come! - Stop there! - Hey, I'm also coming! - Hey! - Come fast! Your bicycle! Go fast! No one will see us if we go this way. Oh, she saw us! Deacon! We were going to get our Aadhaar cards linked! Saint! Run! They won't allow me to become a father! - A pepper juice would be good now. - Hi! Hey, it's them! - It's them, right? - Turn fast! Why are they going in front of us? We should be going behind them, right? - Go fast! - I'm trying! - Stop there! - Are you kidding? Stop, if you have guts! Go fast, my Minnal! Hey! Sajimol! Saint! Sajimol! Saint! - Over here! - Saint! Look here! I'm down here! Come on! In this sack! Saint! What are you waiting for? Open the sack! Saint! My Saint! [Curses in foreign language] What? Smash his face! Who told you that it's made of sacred five-metal alloy? I read it in the church's history. - History? - Yes, Father. Is the church's history in his pocket? Here. What is this? [mumbles] So when my great-grandfather met the Pope in Rome, the Pope gifted him a five-metal alloy statue of Saint Rocky... which resides now in our chapel. Five-metal alloy? To conceal the fact that it's made of five-metal alloy, my great-grandfather covered it in plaster of Paris... before donating it to the church. Autobiography of Kunjukunju! Will anyone cover five-metal alloy with plaster of Paris? Kunjukunju was just bluffing in his autobiography. From where did you get this autobiography? I got this paper when I bought peanuts. His great-grandfather's autobiography! He and his dozen fathers! Father, I'll take care of this case. You can take the Saint with you. In that case, let Sajimol and her friends receive the Saint. They were the ones who found it with great difficulty, right? All of you step outside now. Oh my God! [Speaks in foreign language] Macarena? Hey, my stick! What stick? Look, my stick is missing! My Saint, you know how we managed to get this, right? Leave that stick! I won't take another step forward without my stick! Saint! I will somehow find it. Don't act like small kids! - Please! - I want my stick! The stick will be in the chapel when we reach there. How can you be so sure? I have faith as small as a mustard seed, Saint! Oh! Oh my! Well, it was a tiring adventure! - Your Mom's... - What? Well, your Mom's prayer, your prayer, Minnal's, parish clerk's, Mini's... All your prayers are behind this. Moreover, there was money in my bottom! Well Saint, that reminds me. We didn't find who did that, right? It will be revealed when the time is right! What is this, Saint? Is it money? Give this to Roy's Dad. Your wedding... will happen without any obstacles. Accounts of Puthenpurayil Augustin. Income from chapel offerings: Rs. 350 Amount in church books: Rs. 250 Missing amount: Rs. 100 Similar discrepancies are there from 1985... till 2022. As per accounts, there's a discrepancy of Rs. 25 Lakhs. Amount retrieved from my glass case : Rs. 3.5 Lakhs. You should return the remaining Rs. 21.5 Lakhs to the church, along with simple and compound interest, and confess to the crime as well. Also, if the original golden stick from the statue is not returned, further action will be taken. Or else, I will give deep trouble! Signed by the Saint! My dear Saint! If you knew that this theft was going to happen, you could have told me! I would have given you protection, right? - Unnecessarily, you... - That was not possible. The decision of our association is to refrain from foretelling the future. I mean the Saint's association, which comprises of Seban, Francis and myself. - Saint. - Yes. Is this the only statue with powers? - Saji. - Yes. Saints don't reside in statues. They reside inside the minds filled with love. I heard you talking to the new statue, sharing your worries. Each one of us has been sent here with a purpose. While performing those duties, we may encounter obstacles. We call them 'Crisis'. But we need to keep doing what we are supposed to do. Then, those obstacles will vanish. Some call that 'Miracles'! Saint, I just remembered. I saw the Deacon during that chase! Being a Deacon is the time when one must decide... whether to follow the spiritual path or not. He took the decision. Anyway it's good that he didn't take that decision after becoming a priest! Even though I'm a Saint, I still feel afraid! Finally, you had only me to save you! I didn't see Diana anywhere! Hey, are you still clinging onto that? No. I just mentioned it. That's all! - Saint. - Yes. Shall I ask you something? Again? Shall we go on a trip? You can bring St. George, St. Francis and St. Seban along. Why? Can you introduce me to them as well?
