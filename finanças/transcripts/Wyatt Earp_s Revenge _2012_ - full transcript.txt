Howdy. You got any feed? I got oats and apples, five cent. Water's free, though. Coming down from Dodge City? What's that? Wha--? Uh-- I just said, from Dodge City? Why? Why what, mister? Why's it matter where I'm going or coming from? I guess it don't. That's right, it don't. Look, I'm not looking to start any trouble. That horse is sweating up a storm. So help yourself as much as you like. You a gambling man? No, sir, I am a Christian man. Christian man, huh? Being a Christian man, you believe in fate or choice? I believe in whatever the good Lord has planned. Let's make it choice, then. Pick a number between one and 10. Why are you doing this? Pick a number. This isn't necessary-- Pick. Why? Pick a number. Why? Pick a number. Three. No, five. Five? No! Wrong number. May I help you? Excuse me. I have a meeting with a Mr. Wyatt Earp. Could you kindly tell me--? Just one moment. He checked in. Would you like his room? No, no. He's expecting me. He's in room...? Dover Suite. Dover Suite. Thank you. Good day. Good day. Mr. Earp? Excuse me, sir? Mr. Earp? Ahem. My name is Conrad Taylor. I'm with the Kansas City Star. I believe we had an appointment today, did we not, sir? I traveled a long distance to meet with you, sir. All the way from Kansas, no less. Three days' journey. Mr. Earp? Care for a drink, Mr. Taylor? Truly appreciate this, sir. Thank you. In my research, I found that four Army revolvers were manufactured by Colt and presented to you, Mr. Charles Bassett, Bat Masterson and Bill Tilghman in the year of-- '78. Yes, 1878, but there's no mention of why you were presented with such generous gifts. Our readership would be interested to know if such an item exists. I'll have to be frank, sir. It's been widely speculated that its existence is merely a myth. It's no myth, Mr. Taylor. Then it's true. Yet its significance has remained undocumented. Why? Its significance is before you, sir. "The slaying of actress Dora Hand." I remember reading about this. She graced many small stages in the West until she was gunned down by Spike Kenedy. But I still don't understand why. Could not know why. You did not know her. I did. She performed that night, and she was amazing. Conductor When you receive a fare Punch in the presence Of the passenger A blue trip slip For an eight-cent fare A buff trip slip For a six-cent fare A pink trip slip... I cared for her. More than she knew. I wish I had told her. Listen to them. Shall we go back out? Leave them wanting more. See the cute boy in the third row? Oh! Excuse yourself, please. An admirer. A lawman, no less. Have you spent any time away during this engagement? Hi. Have fun. He's the only reason we're entertaining this town. Third time since the summer. Perhaps the last. Don't know what to tell your father. Tell him nothing, as you've been doing. We're going home tomorrow. Tell him nothing yourself. For those two young actresses, one night, it would change everything. When you're in position. Mayor Kelly's a dead man for what he's done. Son of a bitch, Kelly! You got it coming! Go to hell! What a horrific turn of events. It was at that. To understand why, Mr. Taylor, you have to understand the War Between the States. The war formed us, made us who we are. After killing your own cousins, your own brothers, killing strangers meant nothing. Lawless times followed those long, dark years, and Dodge City seemed to be at the center of it. Men who sought to escape that would sooner kill any lawman who come after him, knowing surrender meant a walk to the end of that rope. Spike, he was no different. After a while, no one would come after them, and men like Spike Kenedy would do whatever... they want to anyone and not answer for it. But Dora wasn't just anyone. The course of that one bullet in the bed. One bullet, one nail on the bed. Was that fate? I don't know. She said they were asleep. What kind of man would do this? Where's Kelly? He's at the hospital at Fort Dodge. He's sick. He let these two actresses while he was recovering. Didn't know he was taking in boarders. Four shots mostly into the walls. And this one... Rider never dismounted. Well, how do you know that? Shots look pretty well scattered. Could've been two shooters and they fled away real quick. Grab the other end of this. Number one. Number two. Number three. Number four? Number four. Ricochet. Looks like fate played his part. One gun, one rider on horseback. Clever work, Wyatt. I do believe you're right. Back in Monmouth, Illinois. He went on to fight when the time came. Wasn't around that much after that. Been a lawman since I was 16. My father leaving taught me about doing the right thing, even when others don't. I promised I would protect those who couldn't protect themselves, women, children, and make it right when they are not. Caulk marks. Unique enough to track them. Any thoughts on the kind of pony? Two horses. This impression's deep. One was a large breed. The other, I'm not sure. .44 Winchester Centerfire. One was a lookout and ran off in this direction. South. Anyone see anything? Marshal? Marshal, Spike Kenedy was around. Spike. His brother Sam too. Mad on account of mayor throwing them out of The Alhambra. Swore they'd cut down Kelly for interfering. Interfering? Happened yesterday. Spike planned to rob the new Wells center. Kelly overheard. Throwed them out before he got sick. Ain't gonna let him get away. I'll ask Hinkle for a warrant. Yeah, and I'll get word to Bat. As soon as you can. Oh, and put two men on Mayor Kelly's room, will you? Will do. Here he comes. So? Kelly's alive. Impossible. Mayor was in the hospital. Had some actresses in his house. What actresses? One of them Dora Hand? That's the name. Damn, Spike. Look, boys, the marshal's putting a posse together. That'll be Earp and Bassett. Wyatt Earp. We gotta go. Now! Come on. Let go or I swear I'll kill you. Aah! Wyatt, he broke my thumb. Tell him to let go. Aah! Wyatt, he broke my thumb. Unh! Bat Masterson, with my sheriff? Sheriff? Son of a... I wouldn't dream of it, - Aah! This gentleman wouldn't take care of his tab at the saloon. I paid my tab, Wyatt. I did, I paid it. Yeah, right. Now, you pay that pretty lady. Now, what's this I hear about an emergency town meeting? Well, thank you, Bat. I'll tell you along the way. Wyatt, Charlie, what's going on? What's this I hear about you boys putting together a posse? We need a warrant for the arrest of Spike Kenedy. Denied. If he gets out of Kansas, he may well escape justice. Request denied. His political influences reach far. Please tell me you're not swayed. You are nearing contempt, Earp. Mind your talk. Sir, an actress was killed last night. I will not permit a vigilante you understand me? We will convene in my court and properly hear all the evidence. While Spike Kenedy gets away? Now, you have the authority to issue an immediate warrant for his arrest. Yet you fear retribution from his father. Now, if indeed you did sought justice, you'd allow us to go without hesitation. Traverse lightly here, Wyatt. Heed a wise friend's words, Earp. As marshal, I'm ordering you to stay. Then I ride alone. There was no choice in it for me. With all due respect, sir. I ain't gonna let Spike Kenedy get away. I'm gonna go with. You boys ride out there, you do so without your stars. You will have no protection as officers, you understand? Wyatt, if you're going-- You don't wanna come, then don't. But Dora deserves better from me. Think about your actions here today, Earp. May cost you your career. All of you. Well, there goes my bid for governorship. Heh. Sorry, judge. I'll get the horses. There's nothing to think about, sir. You boys leave me no choice but to issue warrants for yourselves as well. Do what you must, judge. You ain't back in three days, I'm sending federal marshals after you, you understand? Yes, sir. All right, boys. Who Spike Kenedy was and his brother Sam. Desperate men? Desperate in the sense at nothing to escape justice. From a military family. Had influence. Wealth, political power. It was known he was corrupt but couldn't be touched. But even with Daddy's connections, they would not likely elude us for long. Heading southbound, there was only one place to run. That was the Mexican border. Out of the country, they would lay low while their father would deny knowledge of their whereabouts, muddle the legal system, call on favors, buy injunctions and the like. And they'd likely kill again. You know what to do. Get the boys. Oak Hill? High noon tomorrow. Ha-ha-ha. Good luck, brother. Come on. Hyah! We had only three days. Three days or they'd get away with what they did to Dora, before the law would be coming on our heels. No authority. No badges. No warrant. Just three men. But we needed a fourth. We're gonna need a hand. Who do you have in mind? Remember Billy Tilghman from buffalo country? Hang on there, Wyatt. Spike and the gang are getting further away. We lose them, we'll never find them. But with a tracker like Bill-- Spike will never shake us. Had taken to hunting buffalo, and we met this kid out there by the name of Billy Tilghman. Best tracker I ever known. Was fast with a gun too. He never wasted a bullet. Killed over 2,000 buffalo in one day. Shot so fast, he had to keep his gun cool by pouring ladles of water on it. Now, Billy Tilghman was raised by Cheyenne. Thought like them, was one of them. When he tracked, he was invisible. Like a ghost. Why are we stopping, Wyatt? Reservation's on that side of the hill. See all this? Yeah. - It's a warning. We're gonna find ourselves at the mercy of a warrior chief. That so? Wyatt! Whoa. Easy there, boys. That there's Bill Tilghman, the one I was telling you about. Glad to see you, Bill! - Wyatt. Looks like you boys got yourself a posse down there. Sure could use some tracking skills. Spike was the leader. Cutting the head off a snake. But if we got to Sam first, I knew he'd come right to us. Did you have an idea where to look? I had ideas. Men as notorious as the Kenedy brothers couldn't just go anywhere. But as it turned out, Spike had come upon a little cabin up in the pineys. They were kind folk just trying to do a kind thing. They didn't know a snake was at the door. Howdy. Howdy, mister. Where you headed? Heading south, end of this road. Ain't nothing for miles. What's your name, son? Connie. What's yours? Name's Jim. - You know, he's right. It's about 10 miles to town. Be dark before you got there. Ten miles, huh? That is pretty far. Been riding all day and You, uh... Maybe a place around here I could set up camp? It gets pretty cold here at night. Um... More than welcome to.stay with us if you'd like. Be happy to have you. I don't really think that we can. I mean-- No, I couldn't. I wouldn't wanna intrude on y'all. Oh, no, you're not intruding. Look, a man needs some supper. Much obliged, ma'am. You wanna go grab this man's horse? Yeah. Here you go. Name's Whisky. Go on. What's your name? Jim. My name's Jim. Jim, nice to meet you. I'm Ed. You met my boy Connie and that's my wife Susie. She's a mighty fine cook taken care of tonight. Again, I appreciate it, Ed. Throwing that baseball. Thank you. Wow. Those are real, mister? Uh... We don't allow guns in the house, Jim. I hope you understand. I understand. Saddlebags be all right? Yeah, be just fine. Be a nice meal waiting for you when you get back. Mr. Jim's our houseguest. Bothering him, understand? Yes, sir. Connie, guns are dangerous. You understand? Okay. Go help your mother. He's putting the guns away. I just don't understand why he has to stay. Why can't he leave after supper? It's our Christian duty. It's not the well-off that needs help, it's Jim. There's just something about him. Supper's just about ready, Jim. Sit down. Very Christian of you, Ed. But you stayed on the pursuit. Did you not say you had some idea where he was? Bill was an expert. But by day's end, we hadn't caught up with him. Bill had his trail. Just a matter of time, but time was running out. We wouldn't give up. Not allow that. What is it, Bill? You see anything? Must've made camp. Too smart to light a fire too. Running these horses gonna do us any good. We ought to make camp ourselves. We'll get him in the morning. Connie, Ed, dinner's ready. Dad, can I sit by Mr. Jim? Oh, that's fine, son. Thank you, ma'am. Oh, man, that looks good. Thank you. Shall we say grace? Um... Hon, maybe Mr. Jim wants to say grace. He's our guest. Any fine Christian would. Close your eyes. Lord, we thank you for this bounty, for our breath this day, for our loved ones, our brothers, our sisters, mothers. Most of all, for the hospitality of these kind people. And my grandma and grandpa. And Grandma and Grandpa. And my new baby brother. On the way. Amen. Amen. This looks delicious. Jim, where'd you say you were headed? Ranch near Meade. There's beautiful country up there. I used to fish at, uh, Ryan's Stream back before the war. Hm. Which ranch? Maybe I know it. I don't think so. Try me. Just a friend's, Ed. A long journey, I imagine. What's that? To Meade, to your friend's ranch. Where you coming from? My wife asked you a question, Jim. Coming from Dodge City, ma'am. What were you doing in Dodge? Well, I gone to see a show at the Comique Theater. Did you see what I did with the Dodge City Times? I picked one up in Fowler today. Of the shows. I don't get out to see plays and such, so... No, I haven't. No. Probably used it as kindling anyway. Heh. Is it good? Like it? We're gonna make it right, what he did to that poor girl. There's more, isn't there? You were familiar with the pretty little flower. You know, all my life, all I ever wanted to be was a lawman like my father. Then Dora came along. And the way she .moved on stage, the way she laughed, the way the sun hit her face first thing in the morning, everything I thought I was just changed. You know, for the first time in my life, all I wanted to be was a regular man. A family man, maybe. I don't know. This is it. This is what you wanted to show me? I don't see anything. This is four lots. I bought them from Mayor Kelly back in November. Pay the other half in the spring. Build a nice little something overlooks all this. It's lovely. You know, location's everything. There's a brook nearby. I was thinking maybe we make an evening of it. I know a great spot to watch the sunset. I'll show it to you next week. Did I tell you about the time in Venice, Italy? I am so clumsy. I got in and I completely turned the thing over. You went in. Completely. It's getting cold. Maybe we should head back. No. Let's stay. I'll be tough. Just like you. Maybe I'll light us a fire then. All right. For good. This damn duty. Wyatt? What's wrong? Someone's been murdered. They want justice. They need me. Always with your duty to do. You're going to go after a man. You're going to kill him. Thou shall not kill, Wyatt. I'm sorry. If you go, I cannot promise I'll be here when you return. That's why she was at Kelly's. Maybe if I wasn't so damn stubborn, ma-- You know, a feeling like this only comes once in a lifetime, if you're lucky. And Dora showed me that. It's quite a thing to care for somebody in such a way, with your whole being, heart and soul. There was a part of me that thought if I had taken her in my arms and been with her that night instead of out there chasing some fugitive... I hope she'd forgive me, maybe we'd still be together. Maybe you wouldn't be here listening to me tell this story. May not be here at all, I reckon. You made a choice. We cannot change our choices, I suppose. Well, you tell me, Mr. Taylor. Was it destiny or fate or blind chance that takes our loved ones away? I don't know. Where's my choice in all this? None of us can change the past, I suppose. I reckon. Susie. Shh. Heh. You seem to know what happened in this place. Some things I heard later. Some I figured on my own. When did you finally come after him? When it was still dark, we put our things together. We set out early. Forty-eight hours would go by right quick. I didn't care for rest, but the horses, we wouldn't get too far without them. Cherokee Indians on my tail. I got arrows flying by. I stand up on my horse and the stirrups flip around, six-shooters-- Bam, bam. Nah. Never had a problem with an Indian after that, Connie. That was an amazing story, wasn't it, Pa? That was amazing. It's a true story, son. I got some errands to run out in Ford County. Um... I could take you as far as the county line. Yeah, that'd be fine, Ed. This was a nice breakfast, ma'am. You get enough to eat? Mm-hm. Okay, good. You know, Ed, for my horse before I ride out. You wanna show Mr. Jim where the oats are? Sure. Right this way, Mr. Jim. Attaboy. Thanks, buddy. Where we headed? To the back of the corral. All right, you lead the way. Jim's a nice fellow, huh? Huh? Jim. Nice fellow. Can I help you with anything? No. I'm fine. Seem pretty happy about having another young'un coming. I guess. Let me tell you something. Ain't nobody better than kin. People will come and go, you can't trust them. But kin? That's forever. I got a kid brother myself. We stand by each other no matter what. No one else will do that for you. You never forget it. All right. You wanna hold it? Can I? Got a better idea. This one's yours. A gift from me to you. All right, now keep it just like this, see? No one will know you have it. When you need to protect yourself you're ready. You understand? Here you go. Hey! Whoa. The thing's loaded. Let me show you how to shoot that thing. You ever fire a gun before? All right, put your gun in here. Point where you want the bullet to go. You can't go with him. I'm gonna make sure he's far away. And then we get the sheriff. But until then, don't say a word. Now aim for that, right in the middle right there. Okay? Go ahead now. Let's see what you got. That's a great shot. Let's do it again. Connie! What are you doing? Stop it! Are you okay? You're not to play with guns. You know you're not supposed to play with guns. Get in the house. Just giving the boy a little education, Ed. I give the boy all the education he needs. We need to go. I got a lot to do. Ready when you are. We part ways. Appreciate your hospitality, Ed. And that pretty little wife of yours. You ever come back, I'll kill you. Wyatt. Hyah! Whoa, Ed. I need you to pick a number between one and 10. I don't wanna pick it for you. Can't choose another man's destiny. So, what's it gonna be? Fine. One, two-- Nine. Nine? Why nine? My son's 9. That's a good kid, that Connie. Go on. Hyah, hyah, hyah. Come here. Come on. Come on. Ed... My husband! He's been shot. You riding with him too? I'm a marshal. Out of Dodge City. We're lawmen and we Tell me who did this. Said his name was Jim. We're after him for what he's done in Dodge City, and I promise you he will pay. I wanna come with you. No, Connie, no. I wanna help. I can shoot a gun. Please. Just take me with you. You listen to what your mama says. I will take care of this man, I promise you. I swear on my life. How long you been after him? Why didn't you catch him before this? Answer me, marshal! You don't know all that he's done here. Mr. Earp, you get him. You get that man. What that man did was barbaric. You okay, Mr. Taylor? I'll be fine. You wanna go on? Yes. You a married man, Mr. Taylor? No. Brothers? Sisters? Only child. Man needs family. Folks? My mother passed last year. My father when I was young. This might be too much for you. No. No. Please continue. Leaving that man's body was just the beginning of the bloodshed. Spike had no sorrow, no guilt about what he did. With the boys split up, they'd wanna meet up with the gang before long. We'd have a force on our hands. On the house, boys. It's to you, Bass. I saw the front cover of the Times. Ha. I just don't think you got that gold hidden. You read too many of them dime novels. That leaves you, Jose. You know why they call me Chavez y Chavez? Because I'm double. Not one but two. Well, read them and weep, boys. Wait, wait. You lying sons of bitches. Why don't you stand up and turn around real slow like? Certainly. Oh. Marshal Wyatt Earp. Sam Kenedy, you're under arrest. For what? I didn't do nothing. We'll let the judge decide that. Where's your brother at? Marshal, you can't arrest me without a badge. Besides, you're just a town marshal. It seems to me that you're in the wrong town. Did you get fired? Did you all get fired? Let's get him out of here, boys. Oh, howdy, sheriff. What's going on here? People are telling me you're scar-- Charlie? Is that you? Wyatt? Bat? - Sure enough, sheriff. This man is wanted in Dodge City for murder along with his brother. We're gonna bring them in for some justice, likely from the end of a rope. Got a warrant? No warrant, no prisoner. That's unconstitutional. You know that, Charlie. I told you. Sheriff, this here's the brother of James "Spike" Kenedy. You've seen all the wanted posters around. We know who Spike Kenedy is. We also know who his daddy is too. Now, Mifflin, he and the mayor here are friends. Sorry, boys. I can't let you take him. I don't think you understand. We're in a bit of a time crunch here. Don't make me insist. We're the ones gonna have to insist. Is that a fact? You boys running around without your badges. That's a pretty bold move, going after the Kenedy brothers. Them renegades hear about it, they're gonna come for you. Yeehaw! Whoa. Spike. What's this about? Matter of a posse to take care of. What kind of a posse? Wyatt Earp. Son of a bitch chased us down from Dodge City. Hey, where's my brother? Ask Sanchez. He was at the Old House. All right, let's move out. Hyah! Come on. Townspeople of Dodge just might throw you and Spike a parade. What are you smiling at? Don't you worry now. Your brother will be in your presence once again. Never catch him. Well across county line. Way to Mexico. Yeah? We'll just see if you keep on laughing while you're swinging from them Dodge City gallows. From your capture? One man cannot believe he could escape such a large force. Sam was not my concern at the moment. I knew Spike would be looking to reclaim him. Once he found there would be trouble. There would be some blood spilled. Sam Kenedy. Where is he? Hey. Sanchez. You said he was here. They're gone, boss. Where the hell is he? Spike. Where's my brother, Lloyd? Afraid he's got company. Wyatt Earp, no less. He's gonna get a new necktie. Now, boys, I don't want any trouble. So just hand over your guns. All of you. Do what he says. My father's gonna hear about this, Lloyd. That'll be the day. Wyatt Earp is dead. You hear me? They're all dead! You became the prey. You could say that, I suppose. Or you could say that Sam became the bait. All depends on how you look at it. We could be going the wrong way completely. May have some answers for us. Tell us where your brother is, the judge may go easy on you. Yeah. Any fighting breaks out, I swear I'll kill you myself. Hoist them. Whoa. Belts on the ground. - We are lawmen. Don't do anything stupid. I ain't playing. I ain't gonna ask you again. Now! Bill. Nice and easy. I can see the headlines now: "Wyatt Earp and his posse caught with their pants down." It's gonna be tequila and senoritas for me. Come on. Hyah! I wouldn't if I were you. You couldn't have just grazed him? How is he? He needs a doctor. Finding a doctor's gonna take time. That's time we don't have, Wyatt. Bill? Do we have a trail? We ought to talk about heading back. Giving up? Look, we gotta start thinking about ourselves. I see. Bat? Denton isn't far. They'll have a doctor there. Denton it is. Come on. To get away from me. I never lost a man in custody. I wasn't about to start now. Dead or alive, he'd still be a lure to Spike. Luckily, there was a town nearby. You're purring like a kitten, Pete. Purring like a kitten. Hey. I'm gonna try something else now, Pete. How you feeling, boy? Let's have another go. All right, Pete. Aah! Giggling like a schoolgirl there, Pete. Giggling like a schoolgirl. Looks like we found us the one. I do believe so. Oh-ho-ho. Mercy. Come on, Pete. We can get this. Good luck. Come on. Does it, Pete? Just like, aha, being in the schoolyard, isn't it? Yes, sir, it's almost there. I can feel it trembling at the root. You a doctor? Lord have mercy, Pete. You're doing great. Excuse me, sir. Are you a doctor? Some call it that, yes. Though I'm rather busy at the moment, if you'll excuse me. D-- Did I stutter? I don't think you realize this here's a matter of life and death, and we're willing to pay. In advance. Aah! Thank you for your time, Pete. Gentlemen. Boys. I don't think you understand. I only do extractions. Believe me, it's gonna be an extraction. Well, I am an oral surgeon, but I suppose we can... make room for the table. Set him down. Seems your friend has succumbed to gunplay. Might I inquire as to the events that led to this? You may not. Fair enough. Gentlemen, hold him down, please. Giddyap. No! My. Boy, that is deep. I believe I'll have to try another procedure. Thank God, doc. Give me a little. Much better. Wait, wait. Please. No. No, no. Doctor. Why don't you tell us where your brother is, or it might take a long time to dig out this here bullet. Sir, I must protest. My name is Marshal Wyatt Earp. That there is Marshal Charlie Bassett. That's Bill Tilghman. This here is Sheriff Bat Masterson. This is the brother of Spike Kenedy. We're after these boys for the murder of an innocent woman. I didn't kill that girl! Shut up. Little boy's daddy too. - Now, we need your help. Wyatt Earp? Bat Masterson? Well, go on, boy. Tell the gentlemen what they wanna know. Where's your brother? I ain't telling you nothing, law dog. Well, I wonder where this bullet could be. No. Oh! No, okay. Okay. Okay, marshal. Okay, okay. Doc. Just a-- Just a little bit of whiskey? Aah. Yeah. That's good. Thanks, doc. Now, the question I'd be asking myself, marshal, is what was Miss Dora doing in a married man's bed? Maybe that's how Mayor Kelly got the name "Dog." Seems to me my brother Spike did Dodge City a favor. And you and your men are willing to risk your lives for a whore actress and a corrupt politician. Now, what Mayor Kelly does in his private time is his business. But bringing you and your brother in to justice, that's mine. It looks like you just showed your hand, marshal. Seems to me somebody's out to get a little more than justice. Let him die. - No. No. No! Wait, okay. Okay! Oh-ho-ho! No! The ranch. The ranch. My-- My-- My daddy's ranch in Santa Teresa. He riding alone? - No. Probably got-- Probably got Sanchez with him by now and Confederate Jones. Spike had me round them up at Oak Hill. That's all I know, I swear. Killer shooters, Wyatt. Not likely to take captives. That's all I know. Okay? But you should know, my daddy is a very powerful man. Y'all don't stand a chance. I think that bullet's ready to come out there, doctor. We're indebted to you, doc. No need to thank me. I'm your daisy. I never knew law and order could be so much fun. If you're ever in Dodge City, be sure to look us up. I may just do that, Mr. Earp. Never caught your name. Holliday. Dr. John Henry Holliday. At your service. Boys. Let's go, friend. That's how you met Doc Holliday? He'd come and go several times during our friendship. Doc was always free. We were to head for their father's ranch to intercept Spike. He could not be permitted to reach it at any cost. He'd be home free if we were unsuccessful. But by then, he knew we had Sam, so it was just a matter of time before Spike would come looking for us. What is it, Bill? He's covering his tracks. This has all been wiped clean. And it's fresh. Very fresh. How far is it to that ranch? About 20 miles. Be the west side of Clark County, I suppose. Mifflin Kenedy, he's a war hero. He's not gonna hand over his son, knowing he's gonna be swinging from the gallows. "Surrender Sam or die." He's dead. I warned you, Earp. Spike, he got a mind all of his own. Spike ain't like you and me. He ain't gonna quit till he gets what he wants. This is just the beginning. You best figure out another plan. You really are some stupid sons of bitches. Aah! Spike! Go give them hell, now. Wyatt. I'm okay! Spike. Spike, where are you? Hold your fire. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, you wanna get down. Wyatt! Hand over Sam or you all die. Come on. Damn it, watch out for Sam! I'll kill you myself! Better stay with me if you wanna stay alive. Drop it! Wyatt Earp. I'm gonna shoot him, Spike. Sanchez, out of the way! Shut up, he's mine! Damn it. I ain't going to the gallows! Aah! Spike! Spike? Spike eluded your capture? I don't understand. You were a hero. You had him in your grasp and you let him get away? Let me ask you something. What have you ever done? Hm? You sit behind a desk and you write stories. Not living your own life, living somebody else's. You, sir, are no man. No idea what it means to be a man. What's wrong with your generation? Sit around and talk about what's right, talk about the law. Taking law for granted. The law is an action. You never had to face death. Never had to face the idea of killing a man for what is right, because it's right. Not as of yet, Mr. Earp. Not as of yet. Call myself a goddamn hero. Only children and fiction writers throw those kind of words around. Which are you? Hm? Shall I continue, Mr. Taylor? Please go on. Hm. Well, poor Charlie, as it turned out, was hurt pretty bad. I'm fine. Help me up. We need to get Charlie to a doctor. Best doctors outside of Wichita are in Dodge. We can't give up now. We're back to square one. We didn't get Spike, Sam got away. If we don't get Charlie a doctor, he's gonna die. And with Hinkle after us, we might not go back as free men. We tried, Wyatt. We can get Spike another day. No. He'll hold up, seek sanctuary, pay judges, and we'll have no recourse. He may be free for good. All this justice and for what? At what cost? Charlie's life? Is it worth that? He won't get away with killing Dora, Bat. I won't allow that. What about you, Bill? Bat may be right. This might be over for now. And so what? We all go back to our nice, warm beds, wake up, and it's all a bad dream? Is that it? No, you're right, Bat. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. Charlie needs help. I'm going in alone. I never should have brought you boys into this. You going after Spike's gang alone, that's not justice or courage. That's suicide. You made your decision, now let me make mine. You dying won't bring her back, Wyatt. Step down, Bat. If you're determined to ride into the gates of Hades itself, I'm gonna be by your side. Well, we're getting him some help. Wyatt, there may be a doctor in Cedar City. It's a ways but-- It's on the way to the ranch. Shortcut. Tell me you know one. All right. Charlie had lost a lot of blood. A lot of men wouldn't have had the fortitude Charlie had. When we got to Cedar, a doctor quickly patched him up. Vitals were missed. Through the meat, they called it. Doctor ordered a few days' rest, but he wouldn't have it. I persuaded him. Bat, Bill and myself, we continued on. You let me do the talking. What are we gonna tell him? Don't open your mouth. What have you done? What do you mean? Just happen to be about, that's all. You only come here when you're in trouble. What is it? They're here now and they're safe, and that is all that matters. Tell me or get off this property. What happened to you, Sam? I, uh-- I got shot twice. And the second one nearly tore me in half. Is that all? Come on. A girl is dead. Where? Dodge City. Shots were meant for Kelly. It was an accident. An accident? I've put up with your abuse, your thievery, your animal instincts, but this... a dead girl. Well-- I don't wanna hear it from either one of you. I'm tired of your excuses and disappointments. Mifflin. Mifflin, they are still your sons. How many? How many are coming? Earp. Wyatt Earp. He will not be bought. Bat Masterson. Charlie Bassett. And they also have that-- I don't know, that Injun or something. Billy Tilghman. My God, what have you brought upon us? You are my sons. I will protect you but I will never forgive you. We'll be ready when Earp and his friends get here. Were holed up in their father's ranch. We could have turned back or we could finish it. I decided to finish it. And the closer we got, the more I couldn't shake that feeling in my gut that men were gonna be killed that day. Maybe my friends. It's what we set out for. There was no turning back. Whoa! Whoa! Where'd that come from? In the rocks on the ridge. You see anything, Pa? Not yet. Pa! Right here. Anybody see that? They got us in a crossfire. Goddamn it, I can't see anything. You boys get out of here. I'm gonna take cover over at that ridge. Okay. I'm gonna go by the barn. Keep your guns up, watch your back. All right. See you back home. Oh! Whoa. Earp? Boy said it was an accident. Enough blood's been spilled already. I aim to take your boys in alive. Sam, where are you? Spike! Get up, Sam! Help me, Sam! Sam! Spike, you might... Sam. Sam. Sam, you're gonna be okay. Look at me, Sam. I'm gonna get us out of here, okay? Hey, we got them, Sam. Sam, we got them. Sam! Sam? Sam. Aah! You're gonna die! I need you to pick a number between one and 10. Go to hell. It's a flesh wound. You'll be all right. Go get the son of a bitch, Wyatt. You're gonna bleed out. Spike Kenedy. Ain't no place you can go the law can't find you. I said I was gonna kill you! That wound is gonna need some attention. Bullet didn't even go in! You just grazed me! I'm coming for you. Lose your holster, Wyatt. Lose it! Now! Toss it. Toss it over there. Sam's dead. You know he did no harm! You're gonna pay! Is that Wyatt? Boys! Judge! They're back! You got what you wanted. You wanna blame somebody, blame me. Boys ain't guilty of nothing but being loyal. I gave you boys three days. You upheld your end of the bargain. I'll uphold mine. Welcome back, boys. Let's go! Let's get him. - Spike! - Take your hands off of me! Three days changed us forever. Changed a lot of folks, I expect. My father left us when we were young, but before he did, he said: "When you take someone's life, you give up part of yours." That is the truth. I found that out on more than one occasion. Can't come back from that kind of thing much as you try to live a normal life. War changed men. Changed us all. And Mr. Buntline, why did he have these guns manufactured? As it happened, Mr. Buntline had respect for that actress. He'd seen her perform in New York and London. So to show gratitude for the capture of her killer, he bestowed upon us these specialty guns. Yeah, good, good. Ah. Fellas, it's so good to see you guys. You know who I am, and I've heard about your exploits clear back in Philadelphia. Ha-ha. Bringing down that no-good Sam Kenedy and throwing his worthless brother into jail. Great work! Judge has brought me here to show my appreciation. I had Mr. Sam Colt make a special gun for you guys. This here is the Buntline Special. Ha-ha. But also, every time you touch this weapon, I want you to remember the lovely Miss Dora. I know we're all gonna miss her. All right. Now, Wyatt Earp, that there is for you. Mighty glad you got your badge back there, marshal. Let me guess. Bat Masterson, right? Right. One for you. I'll trade for that cane. I don't think so, sir. How about that hat? The hat stays with me, sir. - Ha. I knew it would. Charlie Bracket. Bassett. Ha-ha. I knew that. Look, Ha-ha-ha. And that means you must be Eddie... Bill. Bill Tilghman. Ha-ha-ha. I knew that. This is for you, young man. How about you fellas? Anybody want a shot of red eye? Yeah! Come on down! Let's have some fun. Thanks for stopping by. Okay, thank you. His father bought him the best medical attention, but still he died of the injuries. Get back here. This boy's dying. I been shot worse and patched up by a field surgeon who was so goddamn drunk he couldn't say his own name. Mifflin. Mifflin, do something. But if anyone had it coming... No! No! I never wanted to kill a man out of revenge. I don't think I did. My plans to live a normal life were over. From that moment on, my destiny was laid out for me. I had... no choice. I went on to kill folks, bad folks like Spike. Tombstone and other places, but I don't ever wanna kill a man for doubt, or out of revenge. My father was not around to guide me, Mr. Taylor, but perhaps things might have turned out differently if he had been, but I have to live with that. Neither was yours. For that I am sorry. I did the best I could. Sorry about your father, Conrad. And your mother. That is not a myth. Mr. Earp, how long have you known? Since the moment I met you. Years before. I've taken an interest in your well being. I've sent assistance in the care of your mother anonymously, inquired from time to time about you. Yes, sir, I knew who you were, even when I read your recent letter. Spike destroyed my life, and I blamed you all these years. But now I realize you did everything you could. You were a hero to so many people, Mr. Earp. I just wish you could've been a hero to us. You were just human. Just a man. I hope you can forgive me. Don't let what that man did change you, Conrad. That innocence, that's special. You hold on to that. I lost mine years ago. Guard that always. Cherish it. Take it. You need a new memento. I want you to have it. My dearest Wyatt: I shall be returning to Dodge City for another engagement at the Comique Theater. I've thought about what we discussed, and I've realized that I cannot live without you. I will be yours now and forever. Love, Dora.
