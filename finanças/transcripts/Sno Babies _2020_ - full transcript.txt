I always give a fuck about everything else. Mm-hm. Yeah. That's your problem. Come on. You would love letting yourself go. I'd have to read a manual on how to do that first. What is that? It's Oxy.

You can get in just about anywhere you want... That's what I tell her. My mom thinks I can get into Princeton so I... You can! Definitely can. Boring! I'm following my boo to Penn State.

Look, I know dad's dream was to have us carry out what he started, but now that we own this place, that dream's a nightmare, Matt. This place is hemorrhaging money. I made a promise, Mary. I think we just need to consider the Reynolds brothers' offer... Thanks. Kristen! Where is it? You know, if you touch my iPad again, you're not going to make it to your 10th birthday. You are so gross. The check was on the counter. Where did you put it Kristen? Can't believe you're making me do this on a Saturday. You need to raise your score another 300 points to get into Princeton. I'll get up 300. The fine print in life applies to you, Kristen McKusker. When are you gonna realize that? When it's too late? You're not going to make today's game, daddy? Client, sweetie. I wish I could, but I will be back for the game on Tuesday. How much is the SAT course? Okay. Honey. Who put this in here? Maddie. Hurry up, Maddie. We have got to get going. Let's go. Bill. I'll drop you off at the airport. Then I'll drop off Maddie at the soccer game. Then I'll drop off Kristen at Valerie's apartment. Then I had got to swing by the office to pick up the brochures for the angel road listing. Then I'll get Maddie after her soccer game. We'll scoop you up, Kristen, bring you both back home. I'm going to be showing houses for the rest of the day. You got Maddie. That sounds like a nice little Saturday. Promise you'll make Tuesday's game, daddy? Absolutely. You know what mom? I'll just have Hannah take me to Valerie's and then you can stay at Maddie's game. Sure? Yeah! You're gonna stay and watch me play, mommy? You sure Hannah can take you? Yes. And then she'll drop me back off here. Thanks Kiki. You better not slack, Little Bit. Come on Maddie. Here we go. Kristen. You didn't do any of the work I emailed you last night, did ya? You want to get accepted at Princeton? I guess. You guess? You either do or you don't. We don't have the time and I am not in the mood. Okay, okay. Yeah. I do want to get accepted into Princeton. Geez, Valerie. Your hormones are raging today. Remind me to never get pregnant. When you due? Not soon enough. I want the world to meet my baby Sophia. Baby baby! Hi. Talk to me, baby. So. My personal fertility doctor, WebMD, says that I need to track my biophasic pattern. Oh, what the hell is that? It means I take my temperature a bunch to estimate when I'm ovulating. And? The good news is my peak ovulation is tomorrow at noon. And there's bad news? Yeah. Brandon won't give me off and Lisa's out with the flu and the new girl's a ditz. Well, I'll just have to come down there and knock you up in the kitchen. Behind the pizza boxes. Sorry, pepperoni pizza lovers. You'll have to get your slices to go because your desperate, barren waitress is making another futile attempt to get pregnant. You're not desperate, Anna. Okay, baby. I gotta go. You know I can't be late. Brandon's on a war path. Yeah? Well you tell that Dallas-Cowboys-loving Irish pizza maker I'll come down there and stuff his ass into a sausage grinder. Huh? Okay. Go Eagles. Damn right. Eagles, baby. I love you. I love you more. Oh! I have something funny to tell you. Please tell. Cruella de Vil is pregnant. You're lying. Nope. Oh my God. They've known for two months. Dude, the bitch isn't even showing and she's wearing maternity clothes. So typical. Yeah. She insists on traveling with my dad now to all his business trips. So. They're never home. You should see my dad. All happy. Rubbing her belly, feeding her tapioca pudding. Ew. So gross. They're picking Irish names, Connor for a boy. Delaney for a girl. Those are the worst names I have ever heard. I know. How's your mom handling the baby? Like usual. This time his name's Hank. They're in a threesome. Oh my God. You're lying! With who? Her, Hank, and Jack Daniels. I'm sorry dude. At least he's so fine. Actually? Oh, except for his gut and hairpiece. I told my mom that she should buy him a chin strap. Gross. Kiki! I scored a goal! Mom has the video on her phone! Can't you knock, you little brat? Why are you bleeding? What, what's it this time? A vampire was chasing me. Oh my gosh! It was scary, Kiki. Well there's no reason to be scared because Kiki would never let a vampire chase you. On the day before, he was to suffer. He took bread in his holy and venerable hands with his eyes raised to heaven. To you, oh God. Almighty father. Giving you thanks saying the blessing. He broke the bread and he gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you, and eat of it for this is my body, which will be given up for you. In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took this precious chalice, in his holy and venerable hands. And once more, giving you thanks, he said the blessing. And gave the chalice to his disciples.

Great school district. Beautiful neighborhood. Ready to see it? Yeah. Alright, come on in. This is one of the first houses built by the Reynolds Brothers. Nice area. Matty? I love the house! It's perfect. We can build our life there. I know you love it, Anna. And I know it's perfect. I also know we can't afford it. Hey. Doesn't happen soon, we can adopt. Kristen. I'm pregnant. What's wrong, honey? When does dad get home? He's not, he is golfing with clients in Hilton Head. Hey, are you okay? You don't look so good. Actually. I'm sorry. Hold on. Hello. Can we wait until tomorrow, Gill? Okay. Alright. I'll be right there. I need to go to the office. We will talk as soon as I get back, I promise. Okay. I'll make it quick. Hey! There's the hardest working girl in real estate! Have a seat, Clare. So how you doing? I'm good, how are you, Gill? Never better, never better. How are your little guys? You got two, right? Yeah, Kristen and Maddie. They're great. Thanks! Clare. You are being considered for the relocation listing agent for this office. What? That's amazing! Yes! Could be an extra 30, $35,000 a year in your pocket. It's between you and John Delorenzo. Yeah. John's aggressive. Well, my decision will be based on who has the best numbers at the end of this quarter. Shit. Hello? Hi Matt. Clare McKusker at Banatee Realty. I'd like to stop by and let you know how you can buy my angel rose estate with very little money down. Hello? Brandon, hey, I need to talk to you about something. Brandon, I'm... Yo it's Brandon, say whatcha gotta say. Ow! Fuck. Matty, Aveleen reproductive medicine has an in vitro program that you can finance. Finance? Like a mortgage? Sort of. How much? $14,692. But you can finance it over four years. No interest. How much are the monthly payments? $306. Babe. I'll work more shifts... We can't afford it. I'll work more shifts. And is it guaranteed you'd get pregnant? No. Still gotta pay if it doesn't work? Yes. Hey, what are you, what are you doing here? It's raining. I thought I'd pick you up for change. Oh my god. Are dad and Maddie okay? Yes, yes! Everyone's fine. Yes. I know I've been distracted with work. It's been crazy. And... Thought I'd check in. Kristen, are you okay? 'Cause you haven't been yourself. Kristen? Yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I'm just like tired and stressed out, you know, with SATs and whatever. It's just been like an insane year for me. So. Can I help you? And whatever it is, you can talk to me. Just between me and you. Kristen. Mom... That scared me. Yeah me too. Okay, go, go on. You know what mom? I'm fine. You sure? Yeah. No, I'm good. Like I said, it's just like lack of sleep and it's like, stress, I just don't feel good. Okay. So I called planned Parenthood and they said that I can get an abortion. But. I need parental consent. You need me to come talk to your mom? No. I want you to consent. What do you mean? I want you to be my parent. What? It'll be simple, okay? Kristen I'll Photoshop us fake IDs. It's not that simple. Yes it is! I know this girl that's 14 and her sister posed as her mom. I'm not going to do that. What else can I do? Talk to your parents. Involve them, figure it out with them. I can come with you. I can't. You have to. Not if you help me. You said that you would help me, Valerie! I wanna help you, but this would not be helping you. Yes it is! What is the problem with this? There are other complications that you are not thinking about. For one thing it's illegal and I could go to jail. No, you won't because no one would know... I would know. And if anyone ever found out, then everybody would know. And then I would be in really deep trouble. I'm sorry, but you are thinking about this like a child. Hey. The Reynolds Brothers put an offer in writing. Wow. Exactly. Cash too. No financing, no rezoning, nothing. This could be an answer to all of our money problems, Matt. I could finally divorce that underemployed loser who snores next to me every night. You and Anna could buy a house. What do you want to do? Jesus Christ. I need to think about it. What is there to think about? Just sign the goddamn papers. I need more time. More time. All right? Fine. Your contracts. Just keep it. Okay we need to split this one. I'm out until Jeff gets back tomorrow. Okay. Let's do it. Oh my God. Kristen, that is so disturbing. Your toes are literally going to fall off. They're so infected. Shut up, Hannah. Okay. Let me show you the big girl way. I can't do the tongue thing, Hannah. That's not what I mean. Come here. Hannah. You're not wearing underwear. You're shaved down there... Waxed. Shaving leaves little skank bumps. Okay whatever just... please do it, show me... Pay attention, Princeton girl. You gotta be careful and get the femoral vein just right, because it's real close to the holiest of holies. Okay. Hannah. Hannah, you shot all of it. Fuck, Hannah! Hey, come on in. Shut the door. Come on, come on, come on. More good news. I cornered Jim O'Hara, VP of marketing and sales at the bar after the outing, he hinted that I was on the short list for the regional manager's job! That is great Gill! You'd be so good at that! Congratulations. Oh, thank you. But that's not all. I told him about you. That you're my rising star. You did? Yeah. I told him you're definitely in line for the relo job and that you'd be a natural to fill my position as office manager when I get promoted. You said that? Hell yeah, I did! That's so sweet of you. Guess what, he's coming in next month. He wants to take us to lunch. What the fuck! I don't even know what to say. Yeah! Thank you.

Kristen and Hannah, have to take a urine test tomorrow at the clinic. And if they test positive for heroin, they'll be charged with possession of a controlled substance. My God. But. If what Kristen says is true, and they were buying the heroin for a friend, it will be reduced to a minor in possession charge, which, is not permanent, but, it'll stay in her file until she's 18. Can't you just shoot this freaking thing already? Oh, shucks. What a great idea. Shoot the coyote that's been terrorizing this place the last two fucking years. Why didn't I think of that? Don't be a wise ass. Shoot it, Mary? This coyote is so slippery, I barely got a look at it, let alone a shot. Well if you would sell it to the Reynolds Brothers, they would deal with this cagey coyote. And every other headache that comes along with this place, but more importantly, you and I would be rich. Look. Dad already sold all his other property to those pencil necks before he died. He wanted to keep this place pure. Yeah well dad also wanted more than a real estate tax bills and a rogue coyote. Damn it. I'm going to go get the tractor. I can't even get a burger out of that beauty.

I'm addicted. What do you mean? You're addicted? To heroin. What? Oh my god. The baby. How? How did it start? How everyone starts. Oxy. Oxycontin the pain pill? Yeah. Yeah the pain pill. How can one pill... It's like nothing I've ever felt before. Ever. I don't even know how to explain it it's like if you take like all the good things that have ever happened to me and you like combine it into one thing. Valerie, I swear to you, it would not even compare to that Oxy high I felt with Brandon. How did it go from Oxycontin to heroin? Oxy is $80 a pill. It's really hard to find. Heroin's $10 for a bag. And it's a better high. Just do the math. It doesn't make any sense. Not with the Kristen that I know. The Kristen that you know is not the Kristen that I know. Heroin makes me who I wish I was.

I wish I could quit my job. And? My mom's going to some, like, realtor convention in New Orleans. What do you mean, and? Your mom is, is still going to go to that? Even, everything that happened with the police? Yeah. It's like, I think it's, it's paid for by her boss. She's on some kind of promotion or something. Just say what you really want to say, Clare. What are you talking... Just say, Bill, if you made more money, I wouldn't have to work, and everything would be perfect. My parents talked it over. And they're gonna go with the original plan. Maddie's gonna stay at her friend Mackenzie's house and I already talked my mom that I could stay with you. What? Kristen. That's not what I meant. Yes. It was. She trusts you you've been babysitting me since I was four. And it's the only way that she's going to go, and it's the only way that I'm going to get better. What about school? = I'm off school today and Friday because of a teacher thing. And then it's the weekend, so it'll be four days. It's just four days... I don't know, Kristen. I'm sorry. Valerie, please. Please, I swear that I'll tell my parents I'm pregnant right after I get clean. Please, help me. Like, I don't think I can do this. Everything hurts.

I left a message with Clare and told her that I'd drop off the second deposit check at her house tomorrow morning. I was thinking that when I'm there, I could ask her if she's considering adoption for her daughter's baby. And if she is, would she consider us. Matty? Yeah. Well don't you think that it's fate?

Call me back, okay? I really miss you. I'm getting help right now and you should too, before it's too late. Okay love you. Bye. Kristen, I tried calling you back. Where are you?

Gonna feel a tight band and then a little poke. Okay tight band. Why didn't she tell us? All right Kristen you're gonna feel a little pinch. I want Kristen to get better. It'll be okay. Where's the baby, Kristen? You need to back away. Kristen. Hang in there for us, baby, come on, baby you can do it. Okay. Slow deep breaths. Hang in there, baby. Mommy? 457. It's gonna be all right.

The truth is that you can be blessed with a great family, and go to a great school, and have a lot of friends and money and all these things that make your life seem perfect. But on the inside, things can be ugly and they can feel terrifying and hopeless. And it. It breaks my heart to think that that's how Kristen felt. Like it or not. I'm going to tell you Kristen's story. I know Kristen's story wasn't easy to hear. It's a cautionary tale like success, tragedy leaves clues. Some of you will see parts of yourself in Kristen, some parents will see parts of themselves in the McKusker Family. She's so strong. And that awareness can bring change. But help and success starts with acceptance and talking. We can't lose another Kristen. And we cannot lose the future. Like baby Amari. Her name means miracle of God. And it's truly a miracle that she survived that night in the nature preserve. If we can save just one life by telling Kristen's story, she will not have died in vain. ♪ All the scars ♪ ♪ All the lines ♪ ♪ On my face they show the times ♪ ♪ I've abandoned my own life ♪ ♪ I can't breathe, I can't eat ♪ ♪ So I just drink myself to sleep ♪ ♪ And embrace this morbid price ♪ ♪ But maybe it's time to heal ♪ ♪ Maybe it's time to try ♪ ♪ Maybe it's time to deal ♪ ♪ With all the pieces in my life ♪ ♪ Maybe I'll sober up ♪ ♪ Maybe before I die ♪ ♪ Maybe I'll finally deal ♪ ♪ With all the wreckage in my life ♪ ♪ And this was self-inflicted ♪ ♪ I was on a mission ♪ ♪ To ruin everything in life ♪ ♪ But now I'm so damn ready ♪ ♪ Just take my hand and steady ♪ ♪ And we will make it through the night ♪ ♪ Maybe it's time to heal ♪ ♪ Maybe it's time to try ♪ ♪ Maybe it's time to deal ♪ ♪ With all the pieces in my life ♪ ♪ Maybe I'll sober up ♪ ♪ And maybe before I die ♪ ♪ Maybe I'll finally deal ♪ ♪ With all the wreckage in my life ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Maybe it's time ♪ ♪ Maybe it's time ♪ ♪ Maybe it's time ♪ ♪ Every moment I'm awake ♪ ♪ It's a fight that you could never know ♪ ♪ Every moment I'm awake ♪ ♪ I'm clinging onto hope ♪ ♪ And I feel so low, but I'm dealing ♪ ♪ The struggle's getting old ♪ ♪ Every moment I'm awake ♪ ♪ But I'm getting sober ♪ ♪ Trying but I can't get closer ♪ ♪ Baby, did you let me go? ♪ ♪ Baby, did you let me go? ♪ ♪ Now I'm getting sober ♪ ♪ Trying but I can't get closer ♪ ♪ Baby, did you let me go? ♪ ♪ On and on we pray ♪ ♪ Thinking 'bout time and our mistakes ♪ ♪ Thinking 'bout time, thinking 'bout time ♪ ♪ 'Cause it's about time ♪ ♪ On and on we pray ♪ ♪ Thinking 'bout time and our mistakes ♪ ♪ Thinking 'bout time, thinking 'bout time ♪ ♪ 'Cause it's about time ♪ ♪ So don't say it's over ♪ ♪ Waiting here while you get sober ♪ ♪ I'm never gonna let you go ♪ ♪ I'm never gonna let you go ♪ ♪ So don't say it's over ♪ ♪ Waiting here while you get sober ♪ ♪ I'm never gonna let you go ♪ ♪ I'm never gonna let you go ♪ ♪ On and on we pray ♪ ♪ Thinking 'bout time and our mistakes ♪ ♪ Thinking 'bout time, thinking 'bout time ♪ ♪ 'Cause it's about time ♪ ♪ On and on we pray ♪ ♪ Thinking 'bout time and our mistakes ♪ ♪ Thinking 'bout time, thinking 'bout time ♪ ♪ It's about time ♪
