AND GOD SAID TO CAIN You can find liberation from a serpaint's bite... Among the... Blood, stone and sand. You work so hard that you can't sleep nights... Among the... Stones, blood and sand. Maybe one day you'll find your freedom. And you'll cross the mountains high. And you'll cross the deep, wide river Of temptaion. There's liberation, from all the trials and wounds, From blood and sadness. And all that mourning. You'll see what no man has seen. You'll face the judge. Stones, blood and sand. You'll face the judge and you won't have fear. (Stones, blood and sand) You'll face the judge and you won't have fear. (Stones, blood and sand) Gary. Gary, here's one way out of this place. That's not the way I wanna go. - Not yet. - God! Gary Hamilton. Gary Hamilton. Gary Hamilton! Here. Are you Gary Hamilton? Liutenant Gary Hamilton? You, Gary Hamilton, have been pardoned. Everything will probably make sense if I read this: Now,the existens of an amendment that condiser amnesty for the political offendors, and taking into consideration your past military merits, I therefore, on behalf of the president of the united states, hereby declare by the virtue of the above amendment, your sentence commuted, and order your immediate release. And so therefore, you are a free man. Maybe one day, you'll find your freedom. And you'll cross the mountains high. And you'll cross the deep, wide river. Of temptation. Hey, Johnny, let's go! How much? It's free. The guards are always in here. I'll make it up on those pigs, not the prisoners. No, man must pay for everything. How long was you in for? Ten years. Alright, let's get a move on. We've got a long way to go, come on! Have a good trip. Sure is strange to come back to the heat and the dust of the south after spending so much time at West Point. - You're a cadete? - Another year, and then I'll be an officer. In the cavalry? Yes. I must decide whether to pursue military career, or return and help my father. Which do you prefer? Eh, a wife I guess, to run my life. If I had any choice at all, I'd get married and raise a family. Why didn't you try doing just that? My father, he has a lot of plans for me. So I suppose, I want have much choice. - Are you from these parts? - Yes, my father is the owner of the Craden mine. My name is Dick Acombar. - Did you say Acombar? - Yes mam. You know my father? Of course, I see him very often. We always meet at the Torrent city fair. But I never knew he had a son so big. And I always thought he was a bachelor. A widower. I lost my mother when I was just five. Oh, I'm so sorry. Hey, this where you wanna get off? You tell your father Gary Hamilton's back in town. I don't see him at sundown. What did you say your name was? Gary Hamilton. You a friend of my father's? Hey! He forgot this. Take it with you and give it back to him when he comes and visits your father. What'cha lookin' for? Rifle ammunition and a horse. You better take it. It's all I've got. Why this is just ten bucks. Best I can give you for that is old Hurricane, son. But he's a good old horse. I've become kinda attached to him myself. One of these days I won't be surprised to find his teeth are coming out like min. I guess sometimes they do look like their owner, like my grandpappy said. Well now, here's something special. This here's faster than a spring for you. Yes, sir. You like it, son? Always was good to you, and you were certain to finding me somewhere around here I reckon. And I bet you that you not even once gave it a thought that the old man could have been taken away by the devil. There are certain things in life that are useless to hope for. We'll see. Bull's eye, boy! He ain't been shook like that since the last tornado! Talking about that, one of my bones tell me we've got one coming tonight, yes siree. That's mighty good shooting, but now I wanna know the direction of the wind. And what's more. We ain't got much meat now bones, you and me, so we better hide in time or it'll blow us away. What do you figure, how long we got? Not sundown I imagine, son. The years pass by Gary, and this place remains godforsaken. You make out trying to build somthing, and before you know it, it all comes to... Tornado. Come on, horse Come on. The only thing that stays it's stand is your old house. Yeah those spaniards must have gotten in their head to build a fortress. I bet you that ain't no ordinary place. - Is Acombar living there? - Sure. The king and his goose, that's him. And you know? He's not only got your darn home, but your Mary too. I reckon she's bad, that's all. I know how you must feel. But I must say that every girl ain't like that, but some of them's that easy. What are you planning to do? Wait til' that cloud gets here and then move into town. With you and that tornado Acombar will be having himself a pretty hot night. Wounded. Wounded. Wounded. Wounded. This is the way you make your enemies. This way you can have all the power. That's exactly what I want for my son Dick. Hey, Jim! I'm coming. Rosy, look what just happened This one is so lovesick, he carries his bed along with him. Hurry up, Joe, we need two more. Are you expecting an orgy tonight? Come on, Joe, we haven't got time to be waisting. It's my idea to protect the bottles. We cover them. We cover them so when the tornado comes... The saloon... The saloon may blow away, but the booze'll be safe. You got a brain in your head. You know it too. Get out. Good to see you. And your brothers? They're with your father and they're waiting for us out at the ranch. Let's go. Bookport's over there. - Howdy, Dick. - Hi. And my bags? Leave them, he'll get them. Come on. Well good bye, hope to see you again. If you come to the fair with your father, please stop by and give us a call. - Good bye, Mr. Acombar. - Ma'am. New conquest, eh? If it's serious, you let me know and me and my brothers will give you the best kidnapping job you've seen. And we'll help him by paving the way. This will be a rather rapid political career. He will be elected senator. And with my money and power, it should be easy for him to become... Governor of the state. And then... President of the United States. Dick! Dick. You look good, son. Glad to be home? Sure am. It's been a long time. - It sure makes me feel good to see you, son. - It sure makes me feel good to see you, dad. Attention! The army of Santa Maria is at your orders, sir. Just like the three musketeers. And maybe some day I can be your Dartagnan. - Where's Mary? - Inside. She'll be real happy you're home. Come along. Juanito! Welcome home, chico. I'm so happy to see you. Mary had the best room in the house prepared for you. - Welcome back, Dick. - Thank you, Frank. Come on up and have a drink. Dick! Welcome home. You look divine in your uniform. That may be so. But I imagine he's dying to get it off and take a hot bath. - Isn't that right? - You said it, dad. The air's to still. Tornado weather. It'll get worse, unfortunately. That's the way it always is, before a tornado. Remember the one two yeras ago? Well, the old folks say that tonight will be even worse. What are you waiting for? You came up for a drink, didn't you? - Go on, charge. - We will, sir. - What do you have, son? - Nothing just now, thanks dad. After my bath. Major Acombar, I'll go up with you. Oh, dad. I almost forgot. A stranger that got off at the crossing... Said he'd be paying a visit here at sundown. - I think he's a friend of yours - Go on. - His name is... - Here you are, sir. Oh yes, Gary Hamilton. - What is that? - Bird of prey. Por causa do tornado. Animals sense trouble, and avoid it. He left this on the stage. Will you give it back to him? - Are you coming? - Certainly, Dick. Yes. Let's go. It's his alright, I remember it well. We put it on the stagecoach, as evidence against him. Shut up! I don't want this story mentioned in the house. If he really is coming, we'll wait for him. And we'll make sure he doesn't get in here alive. It's in your interest as well. And remember: My son mustn't know anything about this. And he won't know, you can count on that, sir. Get the men together and meet me outside of town. He is in for life. Do you think he escaped? There won't be any way of knowing. - After he's dead. - And if anything should happen? I want him dead. Did you hear that, Miguel? Stop him. Once and for all. Get out. A ghost returning. And he'll have... He'll have only one desire in his heart. Only one thirst. Revenge. Are you worried? No, but your son must have suspected that I was. He asked me if I knew Gary Hamilton. And what did you say? I told him that I didn't know him. That I'd never heard the name before. But then, maybe that's the truth. I really didn't get the time. To get to know him. I only had the time to betray him. Let's keep it that way, you didn't know him. Get it? Dick must never know. Anyway, Hamilton will never get in here alive. Whoever's coming's gonna get a rowdy welcome. What do you say, judge? Annie! Hi, uncle Johnathan. Is it true the wind's coming tonight? You bet your life. And you better stay indoors. No peeking out the windows. There's gonna be lots of dangerous later blowing. They're blowing in the breeze tonight. Annie, no. Oh no, little one, no no no, wait. Uncle Johnathan can't se a damned thing if you take these away. - The hour's now. The wind's almost here - Go on. And you make sure they go to bed soon. You better stay inside too. I wouldn't be surprised if Acombar tries to scare that wind away. Where the hell did he go? What's the matter? You crazy or something? Alright, follow me, and keep close. Let's get back to town before we end up shooting amongst ourselves. Vamos. Jim. Let's split up into groups. You go with your men to the front of the ranch. If we don't find him here first, then he will go there for sure. Right, let's go. - Is it true Acombar is offering a reward? - Si, a big one. Gotta catch him first. - Who are you looking for? - Mind your own business, old man. Go back into your house. Stay put too. Damn wind. Vamos. He is nowhere to be found. We're running around in circles. If we keep this up, we'll lose that 10,000 dollar award for sure. Why tonight? What's he ringing the bell tonight for? Can't be the minister. I saw him tie up that bell by the front door. Somebody else must have untied it. It'll bring us bad luck. Jim. Liar, liar, liar! I'm ready for that drink now. Well you do look like that, I hardly recognized you. - What's going on tonight? - Must be the wind. - Bell got untied. - What about the gunfire? Probably just some drunk, trying to scare the tornado away. Let's drink to your return. And would you like to try some of this? No. Jim! Jim! No, Jim. Jim! Who rang the bell? It must have been Hamilton. It was not a ghost. I'll warn Acombar. I'll stick around here. I killed him, father. Father, what am I doing calling you father? And what am I doing talking to a man that believes in the forgiving God? I want you to know that Gary Hamilton has got a life sentence engraved in his skin. Day after day they convinced me that my place was inside. Life outside has no more meaning for me. Now it's only revenge. That takes care of one of them. Now when I'm finished with the rest of them... Santa Marias, Acombar himself. I've had ten long years to think out my revenge. If innocents is repaid with prison, then I've earned the right to kill. Do you hear me, father? Even if God chooses to punish me for it. Yes, he got in somehow, and then, he killed Jim. Don't tell me you allowed yourself to be tricked by one man. You've got more than 30 men. You've got to find him. Who was ringing the church bell? - Maybe him. - Dad. You're not too busy? Dinner's ready. I'll be right there. Spread out. Dad, it sound like there are many drunks out tonight. Would you like some more? Down here, Joe. Quick. Gary! Son of a gun, I knew it. I knew darn well it was you, and that you'd come here. That's why I took the rack off the well for you. You see when you disappeared on that horse I figured you'd go under ground to the old indian cemetary. We spent a lot of time down there when I was a kid. You know things ain't never been the same since you got put away. About the only person that... That has kept her head high has been Rosy. The rest are scared of Acombar. She's had to pay dearly. The shot and killed Johnny, her husband. And the called it "an accident". - And the judge? - The judge? One of the first they could buy. What happened to your leg? That was a present from Francisco Santa Mar?a. - An accident? - What else? If I wanted to stay alive, it was an accident. And what aboput you? A long rest. Lots of snakes. Get on over to the saloon. You'll be a lot safer. Mother of God! Pedro! Pedro! Give me your hand. Let's bring him into the saloon. Careful. Juan! Hermes! Put him down on the floor. They say you are a doctor. Well? Maybe you can do something. I would not like him to die. Listen. It wasn't Hamilton. It was a monster. From hell! Pedro! Pedro! You mustn't die. No. And now I will take care of Hamilton. Give me some whiskey for my men! The need it! They think there is a monster. I say there is not. It is one miserable man. I wish to meet him face to face. Go find him! Pass thit out to the men. And pass the order to the rest of them to meet me in front of the ranch. Would you leave one for me! You wanna be paid? Don't tell me you're afraid that Acombar haven't got enough money to pay for a few stinking bottles. You can leave this one behind. It's raspberry syrup. Yeah okay... Raspberry syrup isn't what we... I hope it's really Gary. This way at least he'll have to fight with one less. Even if they shoot me for it. Catch. Here. Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! Dad. What does Gary Hamilton want from you? Is he inside? Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel. Miguel. Tie it up or knock it down! Stop that bell ringing! Preacher, who rang the bell? Miguel. Miguel! Preacher! Who was it? I asked who was it! I want an answer! Miguel. Please, Miguel. Let's go! Get rid of that bell! - You out there, Chico? - Si! Well fasten it and then come on down! Out of the way! Let's go! Let's get back to the ranch. Well, come on! I was looking for you, Hamilton. Why this mass killing? Why do you hate my father so much? You want to kill him, don't you? Yes. I don't intend to attack you, I'm unarmed. I came 'cause I wanna know the truth. I have to know the thruth! Gary! At last. I couldn't just stay here like you said. I wanna help you. Now this weapon is mighty old. But even if it is, it still works good enough. It's only Acombar's son. He wants to know the thruth about his father. You think you can take it? I'll tell you the whole story. You wanna hear it? Yes, I must hear it. Dick! Dick! Have you seen my son? - Where is Dick? - Isn't he with you? He went out after you. He followed you out? You idiot! You should have stopped him! You know better than that! You should have stopped him! You'll pay for it if somthing happens to him! Go find yourself a gun. Get rid of that! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Dick went into town. I want you to take some men and go bring him back. You there! Get those horses in the back barn, hurry up now! What if that windmill comes down. Let's go, move. There he is. Are you out of your head going out alone? What got into you? Let's go home. Mike, leave these four men here. Get the rest back to the ranch. They've gone. The kid couldn't have told him where you were. But listen, Gary... It's better if you don't stay here for long. - Whay'd you go into town? - I wanted to meet up with Gary Hamilton. Get it going! There's noone left on the street. They must be waiting for you at the ranch. Listen... Gary... I don't understand you. And if you wanna know the truth I think you've gone right out of your mind. What do you mean? I wouldn't have waisted a minute explaining to that young scoundrel like you did. You don't know that he's any better than his father, do you? You have children. You know that our. Our faults shouldn't fall on them. Gary. Mary is there with him in the house. I know. - Take it. - No thanks. I have this. This here's a showdown. Good luck. Hey, over there! I could've sworn I saw something. - Where is he? - Here. Come on in. Come on! Look around. Take a good look for yourself. See this? All of this? This is what Gary Hamilton was. But... It's your's. It's your's, son. Or would you prefer to... live in a dung heap... Like I did, when I was a boy? Well? I'll tell you. You wouldn't like it, boy. And don't tell me you don't like the life I've offered you so far. I don't think like you. What do you mean? That you refuse all this? I spoke with him. I know the truth. What do you know about truth? The truth! This is the truth! We'll have a better chance if we split up. I hope you make it. Good luck. Johnathan! What did he tell you? - Everything. - Everything like what? Everything there is to know. That the war wasn't over when you attacked that stagecoach carrying gold to the confederates. You and the Santa Mar?a brothers. And you managed to put the blame on him by planting some evidence on the stage. But then... He had a perfect alibi that night. He was here. He was here with Mary. But you... You convinced Mary to betray him. She lied, and he paid. Now I know why he wants you dead. The only thing that's sure, it that we must kill him, before he kills you. Even if it means I must become a murderer, like you. Dad. And kill an innocent man. Dick. Wait a minute! Frank! Frank, why? Because you wanted... ...somebody to shoot at. Just stay put, hear me? Stay put yourself, Juanito. No, Gary. No! No. Oh, Gary. Forgive me. Can't you forgive me after all these years? I was frightenend, you must know that. He threatened to kill me if I once opened my mouth! You don't know what a bastard he is to me! I'm just some kind of a whore! All these years I didn't forget you. No, wait a minute! Wait a minute Gary. There's only been you, he was nothing! Take me to him. Acombar! Acombar! Acombar! Acombar! Acombar! - He's in the house! - Alright, I heard you! Look out! Dick! Dick! Dick. Son! It was you... It was your fault. You murdered him! No! No. You murdered my son. No! Now you're gonna pay for it! No! Hey, you down there! At the door! Hamilton! Gary Hamilton? Where are you? Hamilton! Gary Hamilton! Where are you? I'm over here. Where are you? Alright, come on out! Where are you hiding? Can't you just come out and fight like a man! Where are you? Where are you? Hamilton, where are you? Hamilton! Gary Hamilton! I'll slaughter you! Come on out! I'm over here. Right in front of you. Hamilton! Dig under the ruins and you'll find more than enough to rebuild your town. Maybe one day you'll find your freedom. And you'll cross the mountains high. And you will cross the deep, wide river Of temptetion. There's liberation, from all the trials and wounds, from blood and sadness. And all that mourning. You'll see what no man has seen. You'll face the judge. Stones, blood and sand. AND GOD SAID TO CAIN... ...now art thou cursed, a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
