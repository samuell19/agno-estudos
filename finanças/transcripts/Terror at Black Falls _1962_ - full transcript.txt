TERROR IN BLACK FALLS This is a true story that happened a long time ago, when Arkansas was part of the wild American frontier. They say that knowing how to die is something that few men know. At 20, Manuel Avila appeared to be one of the rare men who knew how to die. He did not appeal or cry. He would not let Americans think he was not angry. The men who were doing justice with their own hands they looked somber, nervous, uncomfortable. By act of fate, my son Johnny was hunting in the forest when he saw what was about to happen. For a boy like Johnny, that was wrong. Even though Manuel was accused of stealing a bull from the local herd, the boy still had the right to a fair trial. The thinking of a crowd is different from that of an individual. And when the city of Black Falls chose me as sheriff, I warned them that I would not tolerate lynching. As my son ran towards my office, he thought about what I always taught him: Cruelty should never replace reason. The Mexican boy, Manuel, was Johnny's age. They had played together when they were children. When Johnny caught up with me, he didn't have to say much. A man was entitled to a trial. But Manuel seemed too calm. As if he knew help was on the way. Not from me, but from your father and your two brothers. Manuel's father, Juan Avila, was an outsider. One of the men despised by the community. This was one of the times when time was precious. Life and death can be separated for a second. I think Juan Avila realized the same. He would not stand still while his son was murdered in cold blood. When I arrived, I thanked God that Manuel was still alive. I should do my best to save him. At least, the law of the jungle. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Kill him, Cal. Kill him. He and his son stole our cattle. Do not be silly. He will be legally tried. -I'm watching your trial. -I promise you, I am the law. To hell with the law! -No, father. -Don't get involved, Johnny. Get out of here, Tyler, and take these men with you. In dark and evil ways, violence erupts in the city. The passion of men blinded by hatred... It was evoked to cause a tragedy. It would not stop here. This was just the beginning. Hatred is not born in a man. He learns to hate for lack of thought and hunger. Avila went to a doctor to take care of her injured hand. When his hand healed, he visited his son's grave. Now, Avila was ready to hate with all the bitterness that a man you can keep inside yourself. Your mother died to give you life. When a desert flower dies, another takes its place. This is God's way. You were taken, but where are your children? Where are your flowers? These weeds? If that's God's way... So grief had given way to hatred, and hatred had become revenge. We created Avila. We, the people of the city. Everyone hated him. We made him the animal he became. Hate can not only kill a man, he can kill a city. Juan Avila wanted to do that. TODAY IS THE AVlLA DlA At least, Avila was considerable enough to let us know. Johnny was the first to see it. Naturally, it worried him, but I decided to treat that day like any other. Even if the whole city lost its mind, I would not lose mine. Let's go. Sit down. I'm making coffee. -There is cheese and bread in the closet. -No thank you. Late afternoon is getting cold, even for spring. The cold catches you. Your mother knitted a pair of gloves for me at the beginning of every winter. They were soft and warm. She put leather on one finger in case I need it. His mother had good hands. Do you know how many times I've heard this story? I'm sorry, Johnny. I didn't realize that. You used to enjoy hearing about your mother. I'm tired of hearing about the past. I have memories. They are important to me. Memoirs. You don't win a duel with memory. And now? It is? I did not sleep. I haven't been sleeping much lately. Sure. You lost your nerve and it is killing you. Quiet, boy. Look. You did a good job as a sheriff. -That city owes you a lot. -They owe me nothing. You think you are ready to take care of this job. I don't think he's brave enough. I have a lot of lead in my stomach and I can handle it. No man will tell me what to do or when to do it. You'll take my star when I think you're ready. Until then, don't lean on me, Johnny. Don't lean on me. You do not understand. I didn't mean to... I know what you mean. I don't think you know. Johnny? Johnny? A war was about to start and I was the only general that the city had. He knew it would spread like the plague of fear. People were starting to lose patience, your sense of balance. They were irritated by small things. With nothing, actually. You just needed to cross the street and someone would be mad at you. Look at the old goat. You would think he is waiting for due diligence to bring you to death. When he gets here, he'll probably be dead. Help her. Let's go. Sam! Where are you going? I need you here, Sam. I can't take care of the place alone. At least wait until things are resolved. I need you. I'm just tired of watching you do all the heavy lifting. Besides, a drink never hurt me. And it won't hurt me today. Wait a minute. I will go with you. That's how it happened. Sam Hanks, warehouse manager, and Squint Edwards, your friend who didn't used to drink, found it necessary to go to the city saloon. They couldn't sit in the warehouse and act like nothing was going on. In fact, many felt the same way. And suddenly, from the edge of the city, Avila and her children came. Calm and challenging. As if they were on their way to a picnic. Avila said that today was the day. And he would keep his promise. I could have planted men with rifles in various places in the city. I could have killed Avila and his children. But I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I had. I wanted to settle this in a decent and civilized way. If we had killed Avila and her children, her people would have rebelled. Our city would be open for attacks at night. Our people would be slaughtered while they slept. Our city would be set on fire. No, I didn't want to start a war. Let Avila start. My strategy was to stop it. And while I was watching him from my office, I remembered a phrase from the Bible that said: "Revenge is given only to God." Therefore, a man does not have that right. Don't serve them, Crowley. No, no! We will pay for it. We will pay. Pay it, Carlos. I have no money, Dad. -How much? -No, Dad. We do not have money. We will be in debt. There's a trough outside, Mexicans. Take it easy, boy. He is very funny. A trough. Did you hear what he said, Carlos? He's really funny, huh? Yes. Drink this. I didn't find that so funny, sir. -Are you the law? - Call the sheriff. I take care of that. What will you take care of? Who will you take care of, sir? Under that hat, I have a gun pointed to your belly. So, I think it's best to sit down and play with your friends. Sir, you are black. And a black man won't tell me what to do. -Let me kill you, Dad. -Raise your hands, Carlos. Quito, raise your hands. -You too. -Not. Not me, sir. I'm armed. How old is? I didn't do anything to you. He did a bad thing. He wants me to drink from the floor. No sir. Wait. Wait. Just a boy. I taught you well. Hey you. Go call your sheriff. Say that your good friend, Juan Avila, is here. I will wait for him. Johnny. Johnny? Three of them, Johnny. Mexicans. Billy was killed. You better wait for your dad. They want to see Cal. There are three of them, Cal. Mexicans. They killed Billy. That would happen, sooner or later. They sent me to get you. - Go find Johnny. -He went there already. I warned him, Cal. I told him to wait for you. It's all right. Get out of here. -Will you go there? -Not. Well, what will you do? I'll wait. They came from afar to kill me. They will wait a little longer. For you, Dad. Thank you, Quito. You are a good son. What do you think of me? Tell your kids to drop their weapons. Stay out of it. I told you to drop your weapons. Who are you? I sent for the sheriff. Watch out, Johnny. He's a snake. Johnny? The little one. Is your dad out there, Johnny? -That's right, Avila. -I wouldn't kill a boy. I came to talk to your father. Do as I say or I will kill your father. Daddy! No, Johnny. My children need me! Sheriff, I'm waiting for you. I heard the shooting. Someone had been killed... Or hurt. Who? If Avila killed me, he would kill the rest. I needed to stay alive. Daddy. Daddy. Everything will be fine, Quito. Everything will be fine. I... Do not. Wake up, my Quito. Listen to me. Wake up, Quito. Dad, he's dead. They will pay for it. I promise, my Quito. I'll make them pay. Daddy loves you. He will make them pay. Daddy. Yes, I still have my Carlos. I saw two of my children die. Each time, I died with them. They hanged him for a cow. For not allowing us to work to eat. You took my land. Land I worked for. Land that has the blood of my father and his father. And they expelled us without food, without milk for babies. And at night... At night I heard babies cry. And I cried with them. Now, you killed my babies. Now, you will pay for it. Why, you lying thief. You never owned anything. Except what your babies stole for you. -Be careful. -One of them was even hanged by you. I went to save him! Yes, you were right there. But to save his life or to make sure he wouldn't say where the cattle were? -To save him! -You killed him. Do not. You fired the shot that took the horse out from under him. -There was a rope around his neck. -Cal was there to save him. He would cut the rope and give him a fair trial. No. He lies! You murdered him, Avila. You murdered your own son. Go ahead, Johnny. Go ahead. Or are you too bad to catch it? On here. Yes, shout. Scream. Find out how it is. You're lucky, Johnny. They may not have to cut your hand, as they did mine. Look. Look what they did to me. What's the matter, Johnny? They cut. The hand he shot. They cut to save my arm. He made me a woman. They amputated it! To remember the man who made me half a man. A thug. A big cattle thief, huh? That you can't hold a gun? Your right hand. Go to the door. What's the matter, Johnny? -Why doesn't he come? -He's out of town. You're lying, Johnny. The situation has changed a little, huh? Now your father has to come and save you. Do you think he will do that? -He is not here. -He knows I'm here and will come. But I will be sure of that. There are eight of you. For every 10 minutes that I wait for the sheriff, I will kill one of you. You. You, Johnny, I'll save it for last. I couldn't go back now. The war had started. I knew the city would call me a coward. Leave them. I need to trust what I do. I need to find Avila in my time, under my conditions. So, we could have a chance. - Calm... - Get it over with. And get out of here. It's not me, Cal, it's women. Mrs. Hanks and Mrs. Elliott. They just want to know what you have planned. Women who are worried, huh? We are all with you, Cal. We thought we could help. -Like? -I do not know. I don't know how to use a gun like you, but I can use a rifle. Maybe if I stand behind the barn, on the other side are saloon... -You don't even see right. -Of course I see. Thereby. Thanks but... There is no one in this city who can help me. Maybe I can go out and get some guys together. How many men do you think you can meet in an hour? I don't know, but I can try. The nearest ranch is Tyler's. It would take you half an hour to get there. And the maximum that I would bring back would be 5 men, if you find it all. No, let me take care of that. At sunset, all the cowboys 10 miles from here will appear. They come to town to drink. Avila knows this and will come here before it happens. Well, I think you're right. It wouldn't be good to get in there. There is no way of knowing how many would die. - Isn't that right, Cal? -That's right. - I'll tell the women. -Do it. These were simple citizens, not gunmen. Peace was his way of life. They relied on the law to punish bandits. And they didn't know how to deal with that gunslinger. A man who had gone wild. They had to trust me. The alternative would be a total massacre. In the warehouse, where the women had gathered, anxiety had turned to panic. What did he say? What will he do? He knows what he's doing, Sally. Everything will be fine. What do you expect him to do? Come in and shoot the three of us? With all those bullets flying, there's no way of knowing how many would die. From what we imagine... At sunset, cowboys up to 10 miles away the city will come to drink. And it will be 100 for each of them. Anyone drinking in that place should be shot. Oh, shut up, mom. It will be all right, Mrs. Hanks. Daddy is there and will take care of him. What was the doctor doing inside a saloon? He should be out, looking after the workers. My Hyran is small, but it is healthy. -He can help. -Mrs. Elliott, please. My husband is in there too. And I'm happy that he's healthy. -Is there something wrong with that? -Don't worry, mom. Johnny will take care of them all. Wait and see. Of course, Ken. Nobody will hurt your father and nobody will hurt Johnny. So why are they still in there? Why hasn't Johnny left yet? Please, Mrs. Elliott. You are not helping. We have to face the truth. The truth is that everyone is still inside. Half or more may be dead. We do not know. But there is a problem inside or they would have left. And we better face it. We have to trust Cal. They came from afar to kill you. He's waiting for them. He will get them out of there. You will see. Time passes slowly when the seconds are counted. And every second brings you closer to death. I couldn't help wondering who was being tortured the most, the people in the saloon or me in my office. Did I make the right decision? Silent terror washed over the men. Avila had won the first round. Would he win the second? He's not out of town. Are you, Johnny? -Not. -Thank God. Hey you. Stop it. They're talking too much. I'll let you choose the first. The strongest, the bravest, or maybe someone they don't like. Be quick. You have 3 minutes. Or I'll choose someone I don't like. Let's go. Move! Sit here, Hanks. -What do you suggest, doctor? -We just have to roll it up until Cal gets here. Now, I don't want to be a part of this. Understand this. Whatever you decide is up to you. -Just let me out of this. -Let's attack them. There are eight of us. Not from what I see. There is no way to master them. Has no way. Even if Hanks had a stronger heart, Johnny wasn't hurt and Charlie was sober. -You are a coward, Rankin. -Do not wait. There is no reason to argue. We have to think something together. Yes, we are together, Kemper. At this time. -Maybe we can buy it. -Yes, let's appoint him as sheriff with a monthly salary of $ 30. I have a little money. $ 800. Maybe we can make a deal. Yes, it will work. We'll buy it. I prefer to see you dead. What if Cal doesn't show up? Johnny said he's out. -He is? -Not. Well, then it's decided. Mr. Avlia. Did they choose you? Do not. We have some money. $ 500 if you let us go. Money. I don't need money. I do not want money. Whatever I want, I take. $ 800. $ 800. $ 8,000. You must have $ 8,000 hidden in your homes. -That's all we have. -Your lives are only worth that? - $ 100 per head? -We can get more. My friend, I don't want your money. Well, there must be something. Yes. Yes, there is something. Self-respect. Dignity. Can I buy this with your money? Would he bring my children back to life? Would another hand be born in me? We had nothing to do with it. - Sit down, Elliott. - Stay out of it. You know, my friends, I am a very rich man. I have it and I have time. And you only have one more minute. You... Waiter, bring me a drink. But you can't be serious. You can't just kill us. -Why not? - Well, it's not fair. Fair? What is fair? What do your laws mean to me? Hey, where's my drink? Serve. Serve. Clean it up. -With a cloth. -We have none. - We'll do one. -Dad, a gun. You put me in a difficult situation, sir. Do you want me to turn my back on you? Kill him! Kill him! City dwellers were being murdered, one behind the other. All because of Avila's crazy idea of ​​revenge. And because of my decision to wait for him. I knew it would put an end to the city's morale. But I had to maintain my position. You have 10 more minutes. My people were about to break under the strain. How could I stop this? -Where do you think you're going? -Out. This is no place for you. Go back to your mother. Let's go. Get out. I just came to check on you, Cal. -Your mother is well? -I think so. - Do you think Daddy will die? -No, I don't think so. -He has a heart problem, you know? -Your father will be fine, Ken. -They're scared inside. -Good... This is natural. Go back to your mother and take good care of her. You're not scared, are you, Cal? No, I'm not scared. How do you feel, Johnny? Not so well, huh? Do you think you'll come out of this alive, Avila? Maybe yes maybe no. What difference does? This will be a great day in the life of Juan Avila. Maybe they write books about me, huh? Juan Avila. Perhaps. -Do you want to die? -Why not? What is there to fear? Dying is easy. Living is difficult. And Carlos? Carlos? He'll be hanged one of these days, anyway. But I will give you something to die for, your father. Everyone should have someone to die for. And you, Avila? Who will you die for? I will die for all of you. For this city. And other cities like that. Don't look so sad. It will be all right. The sheriff will come and save them. And you will dig a beautiful pit for me. But in the meantime, choose someone. You have 3 more minutes. Make up your mind. Take your hands off me. -There we go again. -It's all right. So, Charlie is dead. But it was his own fault. I didn't think they wanted to kill you. He tricked you. He planted that gun. -He is right. -How do you know that? -How do you think he found the gun? -We have to choose someone. That is the question. Why don't we choose it? Who would miss him? Who would miss you? Highest card. -For what? -Choose the man. -I don't want to be a part of this. -Sit down. The highest card will choose the man. How are you, doctor? Well, I think so. Kemper. - Stay out of this, Sam. - Do you want to take his place, Kemper? What? What are we playing? Let him take it off. I will take his place. I was going to choose this one. I was looking for this one. This is my letter! -Choose another one. -Not. I will not do that. Elliott, if you don't choose another card, I'll kill you myself. Choice! Which is? Say something! Look! Do not. Rankin cheated. The cards are theirs! You cheated! You want to catch me. Come on, cowboy. You have to choose another card. Now, who's afraid? Now, who's scared, hero? Now, who's afraid? I do not like you. I'll give you a chance. For there. I'll give you a gun. Cross the street. When you get to the other side, shoot me... Or I will shoot you. Good luck. Is it loaded, Avila? Do you think there are men on the street? Maybe if you call them from the front of the bar. -They are waiting for you. -Why don't you go into the bar? Why would I be killed and they would still be there. You will have to face them, sooner or later, sheriff. -So what difference does it make? -None for me. But while you're dueling at the end of the city, your husband will be safe out there. Just like Hank. And maybe Johnny. Yes, maybe Johnny. He made a mistake by going there, Sally. An error? He told me about you. He told me. What, Sally? That I'm getting old and losing my nerve? Well, maybe. And maybe he thought he was saving me. Well, did he do that? He was a fool to think that he could handle this alone. Together it could have been different. But it is too late. And now, he's just another man in that saloon. He loved you. He felt sorry for me. That was your mistake, Sally. -He's right, you know? -Of course it is. -Right? -Sally! Please do not! Please! Matt, stop it! Go ahead. Cause everyone's death! Cause everyone's death! Daddy, a woman. Enough! Sit down. A flower. There is a flower in this smelly city. She has courage, Johnny. She came in through the front door, you through the back. -It's not loaded, Dad. - Cover it. Go ahead. Search her! I'm not armed. You will have to believe me. I should have brought a gun, but I didn't think about it. Why would I believe you? I swear. Turn around. Right. Lift the dress up a little. A little more. Right. Sit down. Sally, what are you doing out there? Where's Cal? He's waiting. -Waiting for them. -Waiting? But this is ridiculous. What kind of plans are they making? None. -What can they do, doctor? -They do not. Lime. Of course, he has a plan. Look, he will not come here. Than... What is he talking about, Sally? He's right, dad. But doesn't he know what's going on here? He knows, but... I don't know, he just... But he will kill one by one, every 10 minutes, until Cal appears. He will not come, doctor. He has been in many duels. That's it. Are you saying he... But it doesn't make sense... Now, he is young. He is... He's younger than me. You don't understand, Johnny. You don't know your father like me. He will be here. The highest card. If I get it, I'll let you go. If you don't, I'll kill you right now. Sally's arrival means another 10 minutes. What did you mean by that? The idea is not mine. Elliott, how long have you lived in this city? 20 years. Why did you stay? As well? Do you have any friends in this city? Leave him alone, Kemper. Okay, Hank? Will it be okay, Johnny? I do not know. I don't know what to do, Sally. I've never been so scared in my life. I know I have to do something, but what? With a gun it's easy, it's a matter of being faster. But this is different. I'm not smart enough. Cal is smart, he... Don't let them know that I'm scared, Sally. Don't let them know. Leave it to me. 4 more minutes. It looks like the sheriff is sleeping. We will make noise to wake you up, huh? This time, I will choose. Tell me something, Kemper. Why is he saving Johnny for last? -Oh, it's his son. -Yes, but why last? Why not first? Well, he seems to like prolonging that. Exactly. But, what if Johnny wasn't here? - Do you think he would kill us? -I do not know... -How's your shoulder doing, Johnny? -Is good. Yes, it was amazing how you attacked him before. MS. Kemper, if you don't mind... Go ahead. Well, that's how I see it, Johnny. He is having fun by getting rid of us and you are your audience. -Now, without an audience... -Where are you going, Rankin? It's simple. I'm just asking you... For me to be killed? Yes, I think you can put it like that. - No, wait, Rankin. -Dad! You have 10 more minutes. It's all right. He is coming. You better get in, Mrs. Hanks. Dad was lying on the floor. Come on, son. Where is he? He has half an hour to go down the street. Some men live 100 years. Why? 3 more minutes. Don't look so unhappy. 3 minutes is a long time, isn't it, doctor? How long did the patient take to die? 3 minutes? One minute? For him, it was an eternity. Back! God gave me three children and left me with this, an idiot. Carlos. My son. You are all that I have left. See? For you. See how it shines? Carlos. If the sheriff doesn't come soon, we'll go to him, huh? Yes Yes. Daddy is dead, Cal. I'm sorry, Ken. -Do you blame me for that? -He was sick. Want some coffee? Come and sit here. I'll get you a cup. Johnny is fine. They're coming here to talk to you, Cal. Have you gone crazy? - Get off the street. -Go ahead, Matt. -Hank is dead. -I know. What are you waiting for, sheriff? We cannot wait for those Mexicans to leave. They fired six times, I counted. -Your own son is inside. -We would help if we could, -but we are not gunmen. -This fight is not ours. Please, Cal. You have to put an end to it. It's all right. Get off the street. It's not that we don't sympathize with your position, sheriff. I understand, Mrs. Elliott. Now, go back to the store, please. -Come on, Ken. -Come on, I'll get it. Look, Cal. If I could, I... Of course, Matt. I understand. Go with him, boy. You know, Cal, she thinks their problem is with you. And even if it's bad luck... I mean, that would be the end. He has no hand, Cal. -Who, Ken? -And there are only two of them, not three. That gives us a chance, doesn't it? Not? A child's innuendo had cut me deep, like a knife. Sometimes, a man has to kill so that others can live. Finally, it was time for me to act. Can you stop this, please? If only we had a gun. What would you do with her? -You can not be serious. -I am. -Well, I... -What? I don't know, I could hit them when they turn around. Come on, Kemper. We met. You wouldn't risk it like that. What if I missed out on nervousness? Look, Rankin. What do you have against me? There is nothing wrong with a man who wants to stay alive. Do not. No, I suppose you're right. It's just a friendly visit. -How is it with your left, Johnny? -Good. What do you want me to do, Rankin? That attack them? Maybe I hit them a few times before they kill me. I speak with a gun. -Why? - Look at Charlie. You can see, on his belt. Pretty, isn't it? Well, that's all. One thing. I saw her when he took Charlie to the chair. So, there is a 50% chance of not being charged. No, Johnny. Look, Sally. I don't know how to get that gun. But as soon as you pick it up, get down, understand? Hey, idiot? That's his name, isn't it? Idiot? Sit down. What do you think of me, huh? Sit down. Take it, idiot. The village? The village? Wait here. No. No, Dad. -Do not touch me! -No, Dad. He will kill you, Daddy! Throw it. Throw it! Daddy. I didn't kill him. I never killed anyone in my life. I've never killed anyone in my life! See? You didn't kill me. -Why? - Get away, Johnny. Why? It had ended the same way it started, with death. Those who were alive could look at me bitterly. Maybe someone would understand. In time, perhaps we could forget about the horror we have been through. A man becomes what the people make him become. Avila died because my people did not understand him, and they did not try. His need to love and be loved was never realized. If Avila and my people had a chance to get to know each other, none of this would have happened. And when they talk about Avila in the future, they will have to say, "After all, he was a man." "We brought them agony and he returned it to us". I realized at that moment that we had better learn to get along. Otherwise, there would be another Avila. As for me, I did what I thought was right. No man could have done more.
