I'll treat you in my car in the parking lot, that way we won't have to register you. But if you need surgery. You know what? I don't. Okay. You need to stop the bleeding. Direct pressure is how you do that. You need to get a cloth or something absorbent. I gotta go. Just get to the hospital and make sure you don't pass out. Hey. Do you have a pad? Like a... like a tampon? What? Please. Oh, shit. Please. [Freddy Thank you. You got sliced? Shot. You a gangster? Yep. Don't tell no one. Well, if you a gangster, why are you on a bus?

You pass out, we ain't waking back up. Hi. What do you want, man? Do you know that girl? What? She's just a kid, dude. Whoa. You got the wrong idea, my friend. I hope so. Are you a cop? That's a guilty thing to ask. My name's Will. I work in Social Services. You don't look like a social worker. Well, we come in all shapes and sizes. Why the fuck is a social worker taking a bus? Is that a real question you want an answer to? Look, man, she asked to borrow my phone. I gave it to her. I ain't bothering her. Hm. Are we gonna have a problem? No. No problem. I had to check.

I'm gonna come get you. Please. I'm gonna be real gentle. Chrissy, I'm seeing shit. Visions. Fucked-up shit. You're becoming catatonic, probably going into shock. You said I needed blood. Like a transfusion? Can you get it? You're a rare blood type. That's a long shot. What are my chances? I'd call your father. I already did that. If you weren't shot, would you have called me? I told you why I called you. Why now? Because I'm going away. This is it. You're always running away, Freddy. The fuck. There he is. I need a transfusion. You want my blood? I'll pay you for it. I know you'll pay me. It ain't that. I hate needles. I'm fuckin' dying here, man! Are you gonna help me or not? Phone. Phone! I told you I'm not doing nothing, man. I know. I know. Then what do you want? Look, I can see you're in some kind of trouble Back the fuck off, man. Hey, is she in trouble? Is she running away? What? You okay? She's hooking up with some guy she met online named Smokie. That's all I know. Smokie. Guess his last name's The Bear or Robinson. I'm pretty sure that's not his real name. How the hell would I know that? I can help her. Then why are you talking to me? Because I see she trusts you. I'm a stranger to her. Sometimes these kids, they run the other way once they find you're social services. But you could sway her. You could get her to talk to me so I could help her. God, I don't have time for that. You're on a bus. What else you got to do? - I gotta take this. - Hey. We gotta do somethin', man. She's just a kid. You do something. I gotta take this. Just talk to her. I already have. Then tell her not to meet that guy. Come on, man. Okay, how about this? Okay, I'll call my office. I'll tell them to come pick us up wherever she gets off. Make sure she gets home safe... All right. All right, man. I'll talk to her. Good. J.J. You're not going to Pines Park. You stole from me. Freddy. You put my whole crew on the line. Where's J.J.?

I want you to talk to him. He's gonna help you. I don't need help. Just hear him out, okay? Damn. Where's your guy? He ain't here yet. Step off and let's wait. Said your guy from the bar is gonna drive us. Where's your guy? He's on his way. Now get off and we'll wait. On or off, son? We gonna keep having this dance? I ain't waiting out there.

Oh, shit. The last time I saw her was at... I don't know. Don't act like you remember. How old is Lily now, huh? She's 11. Hm. Eleven. Goddamn. You want to give her a future. I get it, son. I get it. I do. That's... That's... that's noble on you. Shit, half a mill. That'll do it, am I right? What did you just say? I don't know. You told me how much. I didn't tell you shit.

We're just gonna sit here quietly till we get to Cairo. Vic's going to meet us there, and she's gonna make everything all right. Hey, what the fuck are you looking at, huh? Excuse me? Why don't you turn your fat ass around? I wish things didn't have to go down like this. I do. I mean, it's... it's just the way things are, I guess. Listen, you know I know that I fucked up and I fessed up to that. I've had to live with the choices that I have made. No. I've had to live with the choices you made. You sold out your own son so you can get back with Vic. Me and Vic are straight. Once, maybe. When you worked for her. And then you let her take me and seduce me as a fucking child. Hey, it got you off that corner, right? You gotta start somewhere, boy. You should a protected me. Protected you? Protected you from what? You... you idolized Vic. She was like a mother to you. I fucking gave you that. You didn't give me nothing. Oh, come the fuck off it. When the fuck are you gonna start taking some fucking responsibility? You just gonna blame me for everything in your motherfucking life? Do you know what she did to me? Do you know what she did to me? She kicked you out because you were her bitch. You followed her around like a little dog. Fuck you. - "I love you, Vic." - Fuck you. - "I love you." - Fuck you. She always wanted me over you and you hated me for it. This wasn't about the money. You did this so you can get back with Vic. But she's not gonna take you back. You're a rat. And Vic kills rats for fun. Fuck. At least I had the balls to take something for myself, to start over. "Start over." Man, what the fuck are you gonna start over? I've seen monkey shit fights at the zoo that are more organized than you. I didn't do anything wrong. Fuck me. You're a fake. Everything about you is fake. Your gold chain is fake. Your fucking Timex is fake. That is a real Timex. Motherfuckers. Get up. Let him up. Easy, bro. Hey. I'll snitch. I will tell this prick what you got in there. Hey. Cops could be here in no time. Hey, I got it under control. - Hey, hi. How you doing? - Off the bus. Oh, now. Wait, wait, wait, wait a second. You too. Oh, come on, man. He attacked me. I don't want to hear it. Both of you, off the bus. Okay, yeah, we'll... we'll get off. Come on. We'll... we'll both get off. Hey, timeout. Look. This is what happened. This guy, he started all this shit. And this guy, he was defending her. - Wasn't he? - Yes. He was defending me because that creep tried to touch me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, son. I never touched this girl. Well, I saw him do it. - He attacked her. - No, no, fuck this shit. They... they're trying to set me up. Hey, I know what I saw. He tried to grab her and that's a fact. Oh, no. This is some bullshit. He tried to grab me too. Lying bitch. Sir, shut the fuck up. Ma'am, do you want me to call the cops or not? No. Throw him off. Don't throw that guy off for trying to protect me. Let's go. No. Wait a second. - Wait a second. - Sir, you'll notice I have already pulled the bus over. My next move is to call the cops. Where we are, I figure that'd take about five minutes. They're friends of mine. Okay. Okay, brother. You're the boss. I'm... I'm stepping right off. You need my blood, right? I don't want your blood inside of me. Go fuck yourself. Get your fucking hands off me. You think you're the first crazy to ride this bus that thinks he can push me around and get away with it? I deal with degenerates like you every fucking day. Come on. Ain't you fuckin' Roger. Hey. I got thrown off. Come pick me up. Pretty wild there for a second, huh? Let me get my piece back. Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Take it, man. I don't want it. I'm gonna go see if I shit myself. Next stop, Cairo. That's Cairo. Last chance. Lopez family. Please report to the nurses' station. Lopez family. Please report to the nurses' station. I fucked up. I'm in trouble. I lost the blood. I think I found some. What? Is it gonna be enough? Enough to lose my job over. Look, I'll meet you in the car in the parking lot like I said before, okay? How long 'til you get here? I'm gonna figure that out. Thank you. Don't thank me yet. Hey, Mom. Mom? Lily? What are you doing here? The movie's over. Can I get a ride home? Yeah. Come on. Are you going to be okay? Yeah. Thanks... for what you did. Hey... what's your name? Rachel. Rachel. I'm Freddy.

That doesn't change anything, Freddy. I know. I know. But I can change. No. You chose Vic. Over me. Over Lily. You never did anything for us. You did everything for Vic. You broke me, Freddy. Why are you doing this? I'm doing this for Lily. Lily doesn't need your money, Freddy. Lily needed a father. I want her to do something good with her life. Take the money. Just get here. Thank you. Mm, nine. Maybe eight. - Maybe a three. - Wrong number. Hmm. That's one. Yeah. You're funny. Nine. You're funny. You're funny. Four. Six. Seven. Try him again. Uh-huh. Motherfucker works in social services, finds a girl online. Arranges a meet. Then why's he tailing her? Make sure she gets on the bus? Keep a close eye? The fuck do I know? But she's already on the bus. Why does he have to do that? He's preying on her. He gets off on it, that's what these creeps do. See, Smokie doesn't show up at the bus station like they arranged. Now she's alone. But this dude, Will? This kind gentleman she met on the bus? He can help her. He swoops in. He can play the hero. Says it's getting late, offers her a place to stay I got it. Oh, how about this? This is fun. Hey, Smokie. I know what you're doing, you fuck. Sorry, wrong number. - You okay? - Mm-hm. I'm gonna go check on him. Oh, okay. Yeah. You don't look so hot. Leave her alone. What you gonna do? Call the cops? Considering your situation, that wouldn't be very smart of you now, would it? So what do you want to do, huh? You want money? How much? You assume you know what I want. Five thousand. You ain't getting it, friend. Now, look. I appreciate you putting in a good word for me with Rachel, but I'm not for sale. Ten thousand dollars. You can buy whoever you want with that. Just stay away from her. You don't got it. I do. I tell you what. How about... Hm... she comes with me anyway... and when you die from all that blood that you seem to be losing, I'll come back for the money as well? Hm? Twofer. If you will. Hm? You and me, it's over. You need to come back. You made a big mistake. Do not fuck with me. Freddy? Chrissy, I'm not going to make it. What? I got the blood, the drip. No. No. Look, if you can't get to me, let me drive to you. Where'd you say you were going again? Cairo? I said I'm not coming. I don't need your help anymore. I don't need you and I don't... I got Lily with me. No, Chrissy, please. Here, talk to her. Talk to him just once. You don't gotta be nice. Just let him hear your voice. Hello? Hi, baby. You doing all right? Yeah. You? I'm trying. I'm trying real hard. I miss you. I'm sorry that I haven't been around. Freddy? I'm taking the money and I'm leaving. I don't need your help anymore. You were Plan B. You were always just Plan B. So stay the fuck away. You were right, Chrissy. I chose Vic. I always chose Vic. I love you, Mama. I love you too, baby. There's your Smokie. What? Will. Will is Smokie. He's playing you. Nah. I think you've... I think you've lost a little bit too much blood. Cairo in five minutes. Five minutes to Cairo. All right. All right, I got an idea. That's my boy! An idea for what? You gotta trust me. Empty your backpack. Fill your bag up with this. Then put your stuff in mine. Why am I doing this? I need you to get it to someone. Her name is Christine. Take my phone. Call her and get the money to her. Can you do that? How do you know I'm not gonna steal it? Because I'm trusting you. I told you before, someone took advantage of me. Look, what I lost, I can't get back. You gotta still believe you're worth something. Even when nobody else does, you gotta believe. You got your whole life ahead of you, Rachel. You make the right choice. What do you want me to tell her? Tell her... tell her, when we were at that state park... on the water... I knew right then that I loved her. But I didn't say it. But I could never be a father. So tell her I wish I'd said it. Can you do that for me? Yeah. Tell her that I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me. You're going to be okay. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. We're almost there. You're gonna tell her. You're gonna be okay. Okay? Just give me my bag. Put it here. - Take this. - Okay. Go sit up front. Hey. Okay. You're gonna be okay. Hey. You got this. I got this. Everything okay? Yes. Everything happens for a reason. You got this. Last stop, Cairo. Rachel. Thanks. I've gotta get you out of here. He's a very bad person and I've gotta protect you. You can trust me. Good girl. Let's go. Go ahead. You too. Get out of here. You with him? Yes. Run along, sweetheart. Ah! Not you. Rach. Don't worry about her. Just open the bag. Rach. Where you going? I said open the fucking bag. Why? Make sure it's all there. Oh! Oh, yeah. I'm not going with you. I'm not going with you, Vic. Oh, baby. We good? Get him the fuck out of here. No. No. What the fuck? It's some fucking bullshit. This is fucking bullshit. Huh? What the fuck. What the fuck is this? - Hello? - Christine? Who's this? I'm Rachel. I'm a friend of Freddy's. He's dead, isn't he? He asked me to tell you a story.
