[somber music plays] [gate closes] [somber music intensifies] [Mindy] Loyalty. That's important to you. Yeah. It's important to everyone, right? Your mother wasn't exactly-- For the millionth time, she left when I was a baby and went back to Israel. She's had no influence on my life. Do you feel like she was disloyal? No. It's like she never existed. That's just cheap shrink stuff, Dr. Szyzmanski. [sighs] I think we could make a breakthrough, Bradley, if you would just talk about this. Shane and Jonnie. Do you consider them family? Sure. Do you think people judge you based on your family situation? Don't you wish you had gotten away? That's and interesting question. Well? Gotten away from what? Here. Everything. All this bullshit. How you can't escape from anything and how everyone has their mind made up about you before they even meet you. I can't discuss that with you here. I'm sorry. I'm interested in your feelings on that, though. You know how it is. -[Shane] What's happening? -Got you some Coneys. Ah, thanks. [Brad] How was practice? It was good. [Shane sighs] What's the plan for tonight? [Brad] Not much. I may go down to Pittsburg to see the college girl if she finishes studying. -[Shane] Yeah? -Yeah. Have you discussed your secret girlfriend with Dr. Szyzmanski in counseling? Maybe she might have something to say about it. What's that supposed to mean? Hey. Oh, come with Jonnie and me to Youngstown. There's this, uh, new Imax opening tonight. Nah, I'm okay. You don't need to see her every night. It's not healthy. If I wanted advice, I'd ask Dr. Szyzmanski. Practice ran long. Wanted to spruce up for you. -[Mindy] You look great, Tommy. -You too. Gallo's is still the best. The best. So, you think more about us? Is that what this is about? Well, yeah. It is. And what do you think? I'm still thinking, I suppose. Always the brainy type. I'm the action type. [Mindy] That's why we make a good pairing. I'm not getting back on one knee again. Please, Tommy, not this. I've been in love with you since grade school, Mindy Szyzmanski. I stole my mom's ring and gave it to you. Ma had a conniption fit. Dad beat my ass, but it was worth it. Irregardless of my love, you threw it out. -I'm sorry. -Let's cut to the chase. Forget what happened last time. I'm not going to marry you right now, Tommy. I feel bad I ever told you otherwise. I think you are a lovely, responsible man. And frankly, you deserve better than me. We'd bring each other a lot of respect round town... if we were married. I thought you might see things differently now. Might avoid some complications. No. Look, I know it hurts. I'm sorry. There's not a lot of good guys in this town that are gonna ignore what happened to you in your past. Be a good husband for you. You agree with me, right? I've been seeing someone, Tommy. I'm trying to make something new work. Do you wanna talk about Julia this week? Do you feel like she betrayed you? Betrayed? Yes, betrayed. In a way, isn't that what she did to you? [Julia cries] Brad... Bradley... He has these-- these-- He has these videos of us. That experience must have been painful. It wasn't painful. It was shitty. Did her actions remind you of anything else? Did it bring up familiar feelings? No, Dr. Szyzmanski. No. You're not helping me harping on this. And it's not real original either. What? Did you learn that in shrink school? [alarm buzzes] Our session's over, Bradley. You got me all worked up. I wish we could keep talking. And you didn't even tell me why you value Shane so much. Maybe next time you can-- Thing about my family is I know I'm nothing like them. The reason why I love Shane is because I know he'd be there for me in a pinch. That's the most important thing in a person. Come here, Bradley. I'm not going anywhere. [Mindy] You have to let me go to bed. No, I don't. [both chuckle] -[TV on] -[both laugh] It's amazing. Oh, is it-- Give Jonnie a ride home, Shane. Don't even think of driving. -Didn't even say-- -[Norm] Where the hell's Brad? He's down in Pittsburgh and that. -With his mystery college lady. -All right. As long as he wraps it before he taps it. Oh, shit, Norm. [both pant] No. Just... no. -Why? -Not tonight, Bradley. Come on, please. -Do you even love me anymore? -Shh. Relax. Relax. Boys, I'm going out of town for the long weekend. That means, Shane, you gotta Brad and Jonnie in line. Yes, sir. Will do. Jonnie? I love you, man, but no sleeping here while I'm away. Come on, Norm. I mean, Shane gets to sleep here every night. It's on you. You have my word, Norm. -[Norm] That is my boy. -[Shane] Uh-huh. -[chuckles] -[Norm] And get him out of here. Go on! Shit! -It's a school night. -But-- Just listen to how absurd that is. But why? [Mindy sighs] People at school have been looking at me strangely. My little old neighbor asked if I had a new boyfriend. [sighs] It might all be in my head, but it's taking a toll on me. You're just being paranoid. It's time to leave now, Bradley. -What about this weekend? -Let's just be safe. -Give it a rest. -What about my place? What about Shane? You'll be fine, Bradley. [adventurous music] Goddamn it. Little faggot. [door opens] It's a little late, don't you think? Sorry. I was driving back from Pittsburgh. Can't you find some girl in this town for the next six months? What are you doing up? I was watching some of Shane's game film. I'm actually nervous for the Punxsutawney game next week. Can I have one? Sure. [pours whiskey] I'll take it in my room. Don't be an ingrate. [glasses chink] Thanks. [Norm] I'm good to you. I should be able to get both you and Shane into Penn. I see he wants to go to a basketball school, but I think an Ivy's right for both of you. Don't mess up a done deal. My grades are still good. Shane knows where he'd be without me. You should think about it, too. You're the best. [phone rings] Hello? Assistant Principal Tomasetti here. [Norm] You framing my son again? -No. I-- -Then what? I am busy here at work. I need to talk to you, just kinda one-on-one, about Brad. [Norm] Brad okay? He's fine, uh, but-- [Norm] Is it urgent, Tommy? No. It's just-- We gotta talk. We don't need to meet. Brad's fine. He's putting his future at risk. I'm worried about him. [Norm] Girls turning in any more of his snuff films? Not exactly, but it is about his sexual inclinations. -He's not gay. -Of course not. I would never imitate that about a student. [sighs] We gotta talk about him before he hurts another girl and gets in trouble again. Mano a mano. [Norm sighs] So talk, Tommy. It's complex and sensitive. I'd rather discuss what's perspiring in person. -[Norm] Yeah. I don't think-- -Even over the long weekend? I'll come down yinz place to talk. I can't this weekend. -Aren't you worried about-- -[Norm] Brad is virile. Takes after his old man. That is healthy. Regardless, this has nothing to do with school, Tommy. I try to go by Principal Tomasetti or even Coach Tomasetti here at school, Lawyer Levin. Brad'll be fine, Tommy. I miss when we could just talk in here. -We still can. -It's weird. It's not like it used to be. Are you saying this isn't therapeutic anymore? [exhales] I just wish you would've let me sleep over last night. Then I'd feel a lot better and I wouldn't need this shit. Did you talk to your father about seeing someone outside of school? -No. -Are you going to? [scoffs] So I should see two therapists? It's not uncommon. You can talk to him about us. I looked it up. He'd have to tell the police. You don't have to go into specifics. I don't wanna see another therapist. Just come sit down, Brad. Please. [knocking on the door] I interrupt something? Yes, you did. Counseling is private, Tommy. Levin, you're coming with me, son. -Can I finish my session? -No. There's some lessons you gotta learn. Isn't that why I'm in here in the first place? You're the bad guy here in this situation. You know that? I have no idea what you're talking about. You haven't learned your lesson. That's why we gotta have this mano a mano. Coach Tomasetti, what do you mean? The way you treat girls. What you did to Julia. Is this forever? [Brad] Of course. I love you. [Tomasetti] No good for nobody's education. How is that relevant? You mess with too many girls. I'd knock off what's perspiring. So, I'm not allowed to date anymore? In so many words. That'd be wise. I've been getting reports you're making more of those dirty tapes. Just knock it off, Levin. What are you talking about, Coach? I'm dating a girl down at Pitt. A college girl, huh? [chuckles] You really need an older woman right now? If I was you, I'd just focus on graduating. [scoffs] [Norm] Long weekend at long last. -Thank God. -Where's Shane? -Basketball practice. -[Norm] Uh-huh. -Any big plans? -Not really. Well, that's a good thing for a change. [chuckles] Well, have a great trip. Tomasetti called my office today. Wanted to come over here for a mano a mano. Yeah. He pulled me out of counseling today and took me into his office. Gave me this really bizarre speech. It's nothing. He didn't call me for his health. What the hell is going on? I know exactly what it is. He's jealous. It's all very stupid and juvenile. The school psychologist that they make me see after everything that happened with Julia? He's in love with her and he's jealous of the time that I spend time with her. Who is that? Dr. Szyzmanski. Mindy. All right. Just keep him out of my hair. Get yourself in trouble again, your ass goes to boarding school. Tomasetti's retarded. Don't worry. [Norm] Oh, hey! For you and Shane. Give him half. No one and nothing fun in my house this weekend. [Mrs. Szyzmanski] So, you don't want to move into administration? I became a therapist to help kids, Mom. I'm not desperate for the extra 20 grand a year. Well, that's great, Mindy, but why'd you get that extra degree? Just in case. They promoted Tommy Tomasetti to Assistant Principal, anyway. So it'd be a while until there's an open position. So you're going to be working for him? Yes, I am. -So? -So? Move to another district. Get out of there. Get out of here. A beautiful girl like you shouldn't have to move back here. I never understood your so-called attraction to him anyway. I was lonely at the time. He's a nice man. [Mrs. Szyzmanski] Honey, you dragged him through the mud. Those dagos are proud. He's going to make your life miserable. Mom, please. It was stupid from the start. You're right. He was one of your special projects. I don't know what you're talking about. [somber music plays] [laughs] Me too. Me too, Lucas. Really happy. Uh-huh. Can you tell me more about it? Okay, okay. Uh-huh. All right, well, night-night. Sweet dreams. Love you, Lucas. [text message sent sound] [sighs] [text message alert] [TV on in the background] [mysterious music plays] You little piece of shit. [knocking on the door] [exhales] I asked you not to come over. -But your text. -Bradley. What the hell? Are you mad at me? You have to respect boundaries when I give them to you. That's how adults function. I get it. You're breaking up with me. You've been preparing me in therapy. God, no. It's like I said yesterday. You can accuse me of being paranoid, but I am worried. Why? Has anyone said anything, like, explicitly about this? -No, but-- -Then what? I don't get it. I love you, but-- So, really... I don't wanna be responsible for ruining your life. Mindy, you're driving me crazy. [Mindy exhales] This is great. Thanks for cooking. I needed to chill. I'm glad you're feeling better. You do need to go now. End of discussion. [screams] [both pant] [Mindy exhales] [pants] [birds chirping] [faucet running] [sighs] ["Road Trip" by Decora playing over earphones] [Tomasetti] Cocksucker. [alarm beeps] Get in. Morning. [Tomasetti] Shut up. Get in, Levin. That's okay. I've got my car. I'll give you a ride home. [exhales] Put your seat belt on. -What's going on? -Put your seat belt on, jagoff! Yeah, that seems like the important thing right now. I know guns. Got nothing to worry about, Levin. I'm onto you. And I will sure shit not hesitate to call the cops right now if you don't listen. Why would you call the police? You know goddamn well why. Considering the situation, it doesn't seem so smart. [Brad coughs] Shh! [Brad mumbles] Shut up. Do I have your attention now? [Brad coughs] I should give you the ass-beating your Harvard Jew daddy never did. [Brad moans] [Tomasetti] You gonna listen? Yeah. I could call the cops and ruin your life. But, see, it would also ruin my life. Call the cops for what? Don't play dumb, you slick shit. I seen what yinz are up to. Who? Me and who? Mindy. You and Mindy Szyzmanski. Dr. Szyzmanski is my therapist. Or a whore whose house you just came outta. I don't know why you're talking about her like that. Ah! No good, jagoff. You know about my family? About the Tomasettis? I'm not scared to throw your body in the Bessemer Quarry if you break your word, that's all I'm saying. You and Mindy. What's happening there... is over. It's not what you think, Mr. Tomasetti. She broke off our engagement a week before we were supposed to get married. You know what that's like? We had to tell 500 family members all over this town you been stood up by a young girl who's already given up one bastard child. Huh? [Tomasetti] You know what that's like? Dr. Szyzmanski has a kid? [Tomasetti] Yeah. Bet you didn't know that. Did you, champ? She tried to hide it. Huh? Keep it a big secret. Had it when she was your age. Maybe you wanna reconsider things now, huh? I don't think that's true. I don't give a shit what you think. If word got out that you and her-- It's not sexual and it's not romantic. It's fucking perverted, is what it is! I'd look like a fool for loving her, and Mindy would go to jail. I can't stand for that. This dumb little therapy session you got at school, it's over. As long as you live, you never tell anyone about this affair of yours. You don't even take out your little circumcised cock, jerk off to her image. You got that? Yes. I knew you didn't love her. You're a coward. [laughs] A real man would never let her go so easy. We're good, right? Huh? I'll see yinz at school. Let's hustle. Three, two, one! Let's go! Burpees are horrible. But you know what? They change you. They make you stronger... [knocking on the door] ...and you'll be better because we are doing it together. [knocking on the door] What are you doing here? Working out for that new man in your life? What? You look good. Who you gotta do these workouts for? Feel good about myself. What the heck are you doing here? I know who it is. Excuse me? I know who the other man is. What are you babbling on about? Don't fucking disrespect me like that! I'm sorry. I didn't expect you, okay? You surprised me. I still don't know what you're talking about, Tommy. At Gallo's. You said that you had a new man. You said that. You remember? Tommy, no, no, no, no. You're being too literal. I was talking about my-- -Your what? -You know, my son. Oh. I'm trying to get him back. To get custody. Sorry. You don't have anything to worry about, Tommy. Stop with your psychology mind tricks! That's bullshit! No, I-- I just went to see Lucas last week. I call him every chance I get. I'm trying to build a relationship with him right now. He's my priority. You're a slut and a sociopath. Tommy, stop it! That's horrible. You're scaring me. You apologize right now, and we can forget it. We can have a nice life together. Apologize for what? I knew you made a whorish decision when you had that baby and you gave it up for adoption, And now you're looking to replace that hole in your life. Don't dare refer to my son as a whorish decision! You're making another whorish decision, and I'm not afraid to expose you over what's perspiring. You will go to jail! I don't know what you're talking about! You goddamn well know what I'm talking about, Mindy Szyzmanski. It was embarrassing we had to cancel our wedding. It's gonna be even worse when everybody knows that you've been fucking that little kike weasel. You sound like a crazy person right now, Tommy. It's up to you now, Mindy. [door slams shut] [cries] [Brad screams] [Shane] I'll call them back. They'll make us a new one. I'm not hungry. I don't wanna eat. You hung over? You smashed down one of the frats? Yeah. I don't know. It might be over with this chick. What happened? You getting back together with Julia? -She's always talking about you. -Why do you care so much? It's like you're a fag over my sex life. Nu-uh. [cell phone rings] Who is it? My piece-of-shit mom. She won't stop calling. Is everything okay? I don't know. I mean, if it weren't for my siblings, I'd say to hell with her. Fuck her, Shane. You got us. [exhales] I may have to go check up on her. Don't. Nothing ever good happens when you see her. She is my mom. Yinz wanna go to my camp today? Shoot some guns and that? Can't. Basketball practice later. Yeah, I don't know. Well, nothing's going on in town. I'm gonna go home. I feel like shit. I was kidding before, Brad. You and Norm are the least Jewish people I know. [Bill] Hi, this is the Bukowskis. Leave a message for Bill, Maria, or Lucas. -[beep] -Hi, Maria. I really need to talk to Lucas. He is my son. Please have him give me a call. I'm around all night. [sobbing] I need to talk to my son. [somber music plays] [hip-hop music playing over car stereo] [text message alert] [text message alert] [text message alert] [text message alert] [somber music plays] -What do you want? -How are you guys doing? Don't be sugar-talking me. Why are you over here? My dad and I are worried about you. [laughs] About me? Now that's a good one. You gonna make a real good lawyer like your dad one day. My dad knows you're using and were arrested again. Yeah. So? Well, he thinks that Shane can help put an end to things before they get out of hand, help you out. Why are you fucking with me? Call Shane, tell him you're using. ask him for help. If you don't, you know you'll be in trouble. You stole the only good part of me. Why should I listen to you? I'll give you this money if you promise not to use it on drugs and you call Shane. Use it on groceries. And diapers. Most important, don't mention the money to Shane. It'd just stress him out. Got it? Got it. Fuck you son-stealer. It was his first week at school, and this was before anyone knew he was gonna be our LeBron. And I found him alone, crying, just bawling one day after school in the gym. And I asked him what was wrong. And he told me. That was a bonding moment. I don't know about a "bonding moment." I just had to help him. So I asked my dad, and at first, he didn't care. But then I convinced him to let Shane move in with us. And he's been like a brother to me ever since. [chuckling] And now my dad loves him. Practically more than me. -Does that make you jealous? -No. I was exaggerating. [chuckles] And Shane is just, like, the best friend ever. There's no way I would ever be jealous of him. He's extremely loyal. Loyalty. That's important to you. [hip-hop music playing over stereo] [knocking on the door] -Where are you going? -[Shane] My mom's having one of those self-inflicted disasters that white people never seem to have. I'm sorry, bro. What do you mean? I've gotta spend the weekend with her. [exhales] I'm sorry, man. Oh, no, Shane. This is why my dad got the restraining order, so you don't get dragged back into this shit. I'll be back before we go back to school on Monday. It's no biggie. Just promise me you won't tell your dad. This is terrible. Are you sure you don't wanna just stay here? Of course I wanna stay, but... You're not gonna tell Norm, are you? I swore to him, Brad. Just... behave. Don't let Jonnie come over. No girls. No parties. No way. Do you want me to come help you with your mom? No, I'll be fine. All right, bro. Good luck. It's you I'm worried about. Excuse me? Just be careful. You're the one asking me to lie. [door closes] [text message alert] Shit! [text message alert] [text message alert] [text message alert] [thunderclap] [somber music plays] You feel like you're in high school again? Sneaking around? No. What's wrong? No one said anything's wrong. It's all just so wrong. Just so, so wrong. Where's this coming from? I can't, Bradley. We can't. -No. -Last night was so perfect. Like every night. Right. What? I've been forced to reconsider it. And just common sense, Bradley. Simple morality. It's not good. But you've had no problem with it for the-- I shouldn't even be here. Please never call me or text me or, God forbid, come over to my house anymore. And no more therapy. We're done. Okay, Bradley? Just three and half more months, and then I graduate. And then no one can say shit. [Mindy] They can now. -Did Tomasetti talk to you? -What? Tomasetti talked to you. [Mindy] What are you talking about, Brad? -[Brad] I know he did. -Don't be delusional. He pulled a gun on me and threatened me. -What? -[Brad] Yeah. And he was saying all this crazy shit about how you have a kid. And how it's some huge secret and how he's gonna kill me and throw me in the quarry if we don't stop. I'm so sorry. [somber music plays] [burps] [text message sent sound] [door slams shut] Jesus! It's me. [Brad] Come in. Yinz been thirsty? Shane's at his mom's for the weekend. It's just me. -You okay? -I'm fine. What's going on? Right, so I'm out for a run this morning, and the fat ass pulls up, tells me to get in. I say, "No, I'm not in school." He pulls out a fucking gun. Says, "You're getting in." -What a fat fuck! A real gun? -Yeah. You know a real gun when you see one. Fuck! I fucking hate him. What a pussy. He's saying, "You and Jonnie DiMatteo don't stop showing me up at school, shit's gonna get real." What's that supposed to mean? That's what I asked him. He puts the gun down my throat, and threatens to kill me and throw me in the quarry. Fuck. You know how scary that is? And he's our assistant principal. Fuck, man. Let's go to the cops. What's that gonna to do? His word versus my mine. No one saw us. He's allowed to own that gun. -I just don't get why. -I got to the bottom of it. He's in love with Dr. Szyzmanski. He has been since, like, elementary school. They were gonna get married, actually. -No, you're shitting me. -And he's worried that Dr. Szyzmanski and I are gonna talk about him in therapy. And he's scared, fucking terrified, that she's gonna think less of him. But it's confidential, so he'll never know what Dr. Szyzmanski and I talk about. He told me, "Never mention my name in therapy." That's the last thing he said to me. [laughs] He's jealous of you and Dr. Szyzmanski. Gosh, she's the nicest. Like, I love going to counseling. I keep getting in trouble just to keep meeting with her. I know, right? She's, like, my mom. Like, best mom ever. And he threatened her too. And that's fucked up to me. -You serious? -Dead serious. -That fucking riles me up. -She told me in therapy. I was so pissed off, I could have killed him right then. No, no, no. That ain't right. Treating Dr. Szyzmanski like that? No, we gotta do something about this. I know. But, like, what? I can think of something I'd like to do to that fat fuck. [laughs] Let's go get high again. Ah, my head is killing me. Man, tell me about it. Let's go back to sleep. No, I'm gonna go shower. You gotta get up. No. Get up, dude. -Get up! -Okay. -Get up. -Get the fuck off. [sighs] So... [exhales] Noon? Yeah. I'll let you know if it's off. And Shane? He's completely out of the picture. He's at his mom's for the weekend. Porch-monkeying around? [Brad] Dude, chill. He's gone. [chuckles] I can't wait to see the look on Tomasetti's stupid face. He's gonna shit his pants. [both chuckle] [somber music plays] What do you want? [Brad] Can I please talk to Mr. Tomasetti? You're looking at him. Coach? My assistant principal? Come on in. [TV on in the background] Someone's here to see you. My dad sent me over to apologize to you. Good for him. Good for you for manning up, son. He's preparing a real nice lunch. And he wanted me to come over to ask you if you wanted to come. We could talk things out. To quote him, "Put an end to all your stupid bullshit and give Coach Tomasetti the measure of sanity that he deserves." Wow. That's class. I'm sorry. So? Will you join my dad and me for lunch? Of course, Levin. I proposed this meeting. Goes without saying, neither of us mention the-- Goes without saying... Coach. [somber music plays] [pants] [doorbell rings] [Brad] Mr. Tomasetti, please come in. Right this way. Please dig in. Big Norm went all out. Looks delicious. My dad's upstairs. I'm gonna see if he's ready. Grab a plate. -[sighs] -They're so cute. Thank you. You must be so proud. Suppose so. Do you have any of your own? No. I've always wanted them, though. You'll be blessed with them some day. I know it. [pants] [door creaks] Oh, fuck. [Brad] Okay, he's here. -I can't do this no more. -What? -This is a terrible idea. -[Brad] It was your idea. You thought it was brilliant last night. Well, I'm sober now. Look, you don't even have to come in if he listens to me. And then you just come in and you scare him a bit. No. I don't think so. What are you talking about? This is not like you. I'm not being a puss or nothing. Hold on. You're telling me that you get to pull a gun on the man who benched you, ruined your football career with no possible ramifications whatsoever, and you, Jonnie DiMatteo, are gonna turn that down? [pants] Are you sure that we can't get into trouble? [Brad] Impossible. He turns us in, I tell everyone about how he tried to pull a gun on me. [chuckles] [pants] Okay, okay, okay. [cocks gun] Safety's on, jagoff. [both laugh] Well...? [exhales] Yeah. Whatever. Let's do it. Mindy! How are you, hon? I'm pretty good. Is Tommy home? [Mr. Tomasetti] Nah, he went off some place. -You know where? -[Tomasetti] No. Can I talk to you, Mr. Tomasetti? Sure. Come on in. [Mindy] Thanks. My dad's not home. He's in the Caribbean. Excuse me? My father is not in the country. I brought you here to talk to you mano a mano. Yinz serious right now? Dead serious. That takes a lot of gall. A lot of gall. It takes a lot of gall to pull a gun on a student and threaten him. I didn't threaten-- [chuckles] It would be unwise for you to ruin your life and Miss Szyzmanski's life by carrying it on like this. Maybe. But you can't do a goddamn thing about it. Don't talk to me like that, you little shit. Or what? I'm fucking telling you, Levin! What? You're gonna send your fiancée to jail? You really want everyone to know that I've been fucking-- [grunts] Stop it! Stop it. You're gonna get fired! [gasps] [pants] Sorry. That was really messed up. Look. We can talk it out. Just... knock it off with Mindy and... keep quiet about it. No dice, Tommy.. Excuse me, son? I'm gonna do what I want until I graduate. And you're gonna have to learn to live with it. If you've got a problem-- [grunts] Yinz better listen up right now. [Brad moans] You're this close to being at the bottom of the quarry. Jonnie get in here! -What? -You stupid fucking cocksucker! What are you doing with that gun? Don't mess with Brad no more, Coach! This isn't a game, Tommy. You come into students' houses and you threaten them? You're not teaching any lessons anymore. You're the bad guy in this situation. Yinz kidding me right now? No, we're not! Fuck no, you little bitch. Be quiet and put the gun down right now, DiMatteo. Don't be getting all calm with me, Coach! Relax. [Jonnie] Relax? Relax? -Relax my asshole! -[chuckles] [Jonnie] That's not funny, fat ass! Hold on, Jonnie! [Jonnie] No-huh. I want him to apologize. I ain't apologizing to neither yinz. Put the gun down. We'll all go home and forget about it. No one's gotta know nothing. I'll see yinz at school, and that's that. And you leave Mindy alone. Sure. Right. You boys have a good one now. Fucking apologize! I'm sorry, Levin. Apology accepted. Class dismissed. He didn't mean that. Get on your knees... and apologize to both of us. What am I apologizing to you for? For benching me this season. You ruined my scholarship! DiMatteo, man, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were looking for a scholarship. You ruined my chances to play D1. My dad's been beating my ass ever since. All 'cause you wanted to star your cousin. Had nothing to do with Carmen being my cousin! And you're a little short, don't you think? Just apologize to him for real then get out of here. Get on your fucking knees. I don't get on my knees for nobody. He doesn't have to get on his knees, Jonnie. I will blow your stupid, ugly face off. [Brad] Fucking chill out, Jonnie. Get on your fucking knees. Let's let him go now. Get on both knees. Like a bitch. Jonnie, chill the fuck out! [Jonnie] Now say it. "I'm a fat, stupid bitch." Christ. Come on. Say it. I'm a fat... stupid... bitch. [laughs] This is awesome. Just let him go now. Now say, "I love sucking cock," just like you made me say, and then, "I'm a terrible football coach." I'm not saying that. Neither's true. Say it! You scared him enough. Let him go. No! It's true. He's a terrible football coach-- [grunts] [screams] [groans] [Tomasetti] You say I'm a queer, I'm make you a fairy! Holy shit! Please, Mr. Tomasetti. [groans] [groans] [Jonnie] Stop it, Coach! Stop it! [groans] You're worse than my dad! Stop it, Mr. Tomasetti! [groans] [Tomasetti grunts] Coach T's your daddy now! [groans] Please, Mr. Tomasetti, stop it! [Jonnie coughs] [grunts] [Jonnie coughs] Stop it, Coach! [grunts] [cocks gun] Stop! [thud] [Jonnie] Mm. My fucking nuts. [pants] I think I'm going to marry Tommy. Is that okay? [scoffs] You don't need my permission. You're the lady. But you have been through this already. But I know it's the right time. [Mr. Tomasetti] You want my opinion, hon? Please. Tommy's my son. I love him. But the boy's dumber than a Polock Helen Keller. [chuckles] Now, no offense to either yinz, but... You could do better for yourself than Tommy. [click his tongue] I'm glad we put that to bed, hon. But let's keep this mano a mano. Actually, can you just tell Tommy I came by and had some good news? It's just I know I'm supposed to marry him. We have to run away. Maybe. Where to? Where's big Norm? He's in the Caribbean. Let's go there. We can stay with Big Norm. We can open a boat business or be monkey breeders. -We gotta think clear now. -Big Norm. -He'll get us off down there. -He's not licensed down there. [Jonnie] Oh! Fuck! My fucking balls! Texas. -What? -We go to Texas. -Why Texas? That's crazy. -We take Spanish, Brad. They speak Spanish down there. Duh! They execute you for anything in Texas. Fuck you! What have you got then? Maybe... self-defense? He wasn't attacking you, though. You. Your balls. -I did it to protect you. -Fuck you. We're not telling nobody about this. They'll think I was gay with him. This is serious. We have to tell-- -[Jonnie] No way, Brad. -Yes, we have to let them know-- -No way, Brad. -We have to tell them exactly-- Fuck no! They're my nuts! You have to be rational right now. Do you know what happens to people in jail, man? People find out about this, the guards, they'll auction my asshole off to some old cons. That's so stupid. That's not even stupid. That's comical. That's comically stupid! So, you don't wanna help us get off because you're afraid of some imaginary gay people? What? We just shot our assistant principal. We're about to get executed in Texas, and you wanna talk about faggots' rights? Fuck rational, Brad! We need a plan! -Hey. -We need to go-- Don't you fucking touch me! I'll go Hitler on your ass, Brad! [pants] You are my best friend and the best person I know. And you just killed someone. I did it to protect you. My dad is gonna beat my ass. He's literally gonna break my spine. [Brad] Maybe he won't. Yeah-huh. Shane gets to live with you and Big Norm in this mansion. And you're gonna get off. And I'm gonna go to prison and-- and cons are gonna rape me, and then my dad is gonna to beat my ass. [pants] Why's Shane deserve all this? It ain't fair. It's not fair. It's not-- [sobs] Shit. At least Tomasetti can't mess with Dr. Szyzmanski no more. But we can't go to the cops. They'll ask too many questions. Yeah. You're right, Jonnie. We can't tell the police. Don't worry. You're not gonna have to show anyone your nuts. [cries] [car horn honks] [Jonnie] All blinds are closed. [Brad] All right. Come help me in here. [Jonnie] All the doors are locked. All the phones are off the hook. Good. -What if Shane comes home? -[Brad] He won't. He's at his mom's for the whole weekend. Relax. So now what? [Brad] We gotta move the body. I skeeve dead people. -I don't wanna touch him. -Well, we can't leave it here. What if someone comes over? Let's do this. Fine, but I get the feet though. Fine. One... two... three. Christ, he's a fat fuck! Fuck! Oh, fuck. All right, let's just drag him. Yeah. -[cell phone rings] -Fuck! God! It's a ghost. -It's his cell phone. -[Jonnie] Oh, fuck! [cell phone rings] [Jonnie] Who was it? It's his dad. We can't just, like, pretend this never happened? Don't worry. I'll come up with something. Just no cops. [Jonnie] No cops. [Shane] Brad! I can't do it anymore. Brad! -Brad-- -[Shane] She's so selfish! -What are we gonna do? -[Shane] I hate her. Thank God for you and Norm. If it weren't you two-- What the shit happened to Coach Tomasetti? It's... not good. [Shane sobs] Hey! [Shane sobs] [sobs] What's wrong? [Shane] Nothing. Why are you crying? Just... let me be. [sobs] If you tell me, maybe I can help. My mom's a piece of shit. What's your name? [sobs] Shane. I'm Brad. [exhales] -Your first day here? -[Shane] Yeah. You're gonna miss the buses. I have got basketball practice. What's the matter, Shane? [sobs] My mom got arrested. They put me in foster again, and I got moved to this school. [exhales] I'm so sorry. Maybe my dad can help out. He loves basketball. [scoffs] I'll ask him. Yeah? [both laugh] What happened? Get off your high fucking horse. Shut up, DiMatteo. No, don't talk to me like that, boy. Let's all just relax. Relax? Is Coach Tomasetti dead? -Did you kill him? -Not exactly. Look at him. Of course he's fucking dead. Let me talk this through. No! He's judging us. Look at his smug judgment face. There's a dead man on the floor. A dead teacher. Of course I'm judging you! Don't fucking judge us! Okay. Tell me what happened. You hit the fucking lottery that Big Norm lets you live here and you don't gotta live with your chicken head mom. I'm not talking to you. This is murder. This is serious. You could get executed for this. No-huh. No. This ain't Texas. -What? -Just chill out, Jonnie. You know what? No, you heard me, Obama. And you come in here judging us and you get to live here and you don't even know what it's like to be me! You need to get a hold of yourself. Don't-- don't give me attitude like that. Or what? You ignoramus Napoleon-complexed midget. Nigger! Sorry. I had to do that. I don't blame you. You just asked me to tell you. Wha-- Did you already know? You didn't exactly have me fooled, Einstein. Well, if you're so pissed off now, why didn't you say something? [Shane] Because I used to trust you. Fuck you. I can't believe you just said that. Well? What happened here? I swear to God on this. Coach Tomasetti caught onto me and Mindy. -He pulled a gun on me. -He pulled a gun on you? And then shot himself dead on our living room floor? You don't have to be such a self-righteous prick about this. All right. Tell me how he died. Jonnie and I were just gonna to scare him. Just? Jonnie's right. You can be really ungrateful. [Shane] You're calling me ungrateful right now? Look at everything you're giving away. Every blessing in the world. [sighs] Why didn't you call me? Fuck you, Dad. No, Dad. Let's get him to a couch. Fuck! I forgot we killed Tomasetti. Oh, we are fucked! No, you're not. We're not. This is not a big deal. -It's a big deal! -Fuck, yeah, it is! [Shane] Yeah, it's a big deal, of course. But if we just go to the police, and you tell them exactly what Brad just told me, it'll be fine. Fuck that. Me and Brad, we're getting out of here. [Shane] No! Why? Think about it. Brad was having an affair with Dr. Szyzmanski. Tomasetti pulls a gun on him when he finds out. He comes over here to confront him again. You happened to have a hunting rifle. Tomasetti attacks you. Brad shot him. It's self-defense. Neither of you should get in trouble. But Dr. Szyzmanski might. You was fucking Miss Szyzmanski? That's how come Tomasetti pulled a gun on you! -No. -Yes. No. Absolutely not. To both of you. We're not going to the cops. Why not? It makes a lot of sense when Shane says it all calm and judgmental. How else are we gonna get off? -No. No police. -Why? If what you told me is true, that's the only way. Yeah, we don't gotta run away or nothing. Just let's call the cops and fess up. That's what you wanted before, Brad. What? No. No, I changed my mind. It's a bad idea. Why? 'Cause you're scared they're going to get her in trouble? No. But since when does going to the cops and telling them that we lured someone, let alone our assistant principal, to my house to scare him a bit and then, oh, by the way, we shot him work as a plausible defense? Do you possibly have a better plan? For Christ's sakes, no, not yet! But we're keeping the cops out of this. Because of Dr. Szyzmanski. Jonnie's right. You're worried that they're gonna th-- Keep her out of this! -Was you really smashing that? -Yes. -And she deserves to go to jail. -Don't you dare say that. It's sick and disgusting. She was sleeping with a student. I mean, it's awesome that you were boning a grown up. But, Brad, she's gonna go to jail for, like, raping you. This is nuts. Exactly. Nuts. You hear that, Brad? Mindy and the cops stay out of this. End of story. And do you really wanna go to the police? Tell them everything? About how you brought your dad's gun over here. Show them your nuts? You're right, Brad. We're fucked. [exhales] Let's just get this over with. The sooner we do it, the easier it'll be. Fuck you, Shane! Look at everything I've given you. And all you wanna do is make sure that you don't get in trouble so Norm can call up UPenn and you still get in. You're so selfish. This is your dad's worst nightmare! He trusted me. I'm doing the decent thing. Shane, I ain't so sure you're right, neither. Let's call the cops. -Get out of my house. -No, Brad. I'm sorry. I'm not letting you drag your father through the mud because his spoiled son doesn't realize how good he has it. You think he's perfect? Yeah. I kinda do. My mom didn't think so. What? Leave. No, Brad. This is my home. [both grunt] I can hurt you very badly. You're supposed to be my friend. [Shane] I am, Brad. You're supposed to be loyal to me and love me. I do love you. That's why we have to call the cops! [cocks gun] Get off him, porch monkey. My workout got interrupted. I'm restless. Oh! This one's cute. Come and look. Hm? I'm sure it is. Honey, you look awful. What's going on? Thanks. I thought about what you said. I think you're right. It's time to settle down. Root myself. Well, good. I wanna get custody of Lucas. The Bukowskis said if I ever was in the position to take him in again, they'd-- Absolutely not! Excuse me? I thought you would be thrilled. You would disrupt his entire life. Frankly, I think you would do him more harm than good. I help people, Mom. I do. Okay. He's taped up enough. You can put the gun down. -[Jonnie] But-- -Put it down! You saw what can happen. I'm sorry, man. What are you saying sorry to him for? I'm sorry to you, too. [Jonnie] So what do we do? You stay here. Keep things calm. Keep an eye on Shane. I have to go talk to Dr. Szyzmanski. Fuck me! Great idea. You and her-- No. I have to make sure that she doesn't come here and find us like this. Don't fuck me. You and Shane's all I got. I won't. Mindy! Mindy! Mindy, open up! Please! Are you there? [knocking on the window] [gasps] What are you doing? -We need to talk. -You need to leave. I need your advice more than ever. Look... Before you leave, before we talk-- -What? -I need to tell you something. Tommy and I-- Mr. Tomasetti and I... We're getting married. -You're processing it well? -No. [exhales] No, you're not marrying him. [Mindy] I was worried you might be in denial. I'm not in denial. You are in denial. You're starting to mourn. Tommy threatened to turn me in for our relationship, Bradley. I have no choice. That's why we can never see each other again. I need to explain something about Coach Tomasetti to you. No, you don't, honey. I've known him my entire life. Go! Go tell the police right now, or I'll turn you in. -What? -[Mindy] Go turn yourselves in! Turn ourselves in? It was an accident! He pulled a gun on me in the first place. It's your only chance to get off, Brad. I'm sure your father will help you. I came here to talk things out. [Mindy] No. I'm done. Maybe we could make a breakthrough? Leave! I didn't come here for this judgmental bullshit! [cries] Do you think that if we throw the body in the quarry they'll ever find out? Go! Tell the police right now! I can't tell the police, Mindy, because then they'll find out about us, and then they'll-- They'll send you to jail. Look at you. -My God. -What? What have I done to you? It's not your fault. It's Tomasetti's. I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. Just don't tell the cops. And if they ask you anything, tell them it was self-defense. And no matter what, do not tell them about us. Promise me, Mindy. [Mindy sobs] I know you still love me. That's why I came here. My love is a bad thing. It's not what you need. I don't care. Go. Or I'll turn you in. Not you, too. [sobs] [door opens] [cocks gun] What the fuck took you so long? What are you crying for? Just look at Shane. He was like a superhero, and now he's just-- [Jonnie sobs] We're fucked. We'll be okay. [sighs] How come you didn't tell me about you and Dr. Szyzmanski? I was scared she would leave me. [Jonnie] She helped me out a lot in therapy. And now, I just don't know if it was all bullshit or if she actually cared. Mindy cares. Trust me. Just turn ourselves in, Brad. We can't do that to Mindy. Just keep it together a little longer. You know, you've been thinking for hours and hours. We're just getting closer and closer to going to jail. Please, just-- just tell me what to do, Brad, please. Go out back and smoke a cigarette. I'm gonna call Norm. He'll know what to do. [snorts] Yeah, yeah. [snorts] [sobs] Fuck. [beep] Hi, Mom. It's, uh, Brad. Your son. I thought now may be a good time to talk for a bit. But... I guess I'll just, uh-- You can just call me back sometime when you get this. Okay. I hope you're doing well. You sure about this, Brad? Shane, I'm sorry about everything, but we need your help now. Can we trust you? -Can we trust you, Brad? -Of course. What's the plan here, for God's sakes Brad? Shane's gotta play ball if we're not gonna get in trouble. Who are you, Jimmy fucking Hoffa? No, but I know who you are. If this is the part where I'm supposed to say, "Thank you," or you're gonna shoot me... Thank you, Brad. As if I haven't thanked you and Norm every goddamn day that I've lived here! You don't have to say thank you. Then what do you want? Yeah. What do you want from us? We just all need to be loyal to each other right now. Right now we need each other more than ever because who else have we got? Okay. I'm in. Me too. [Brad] Both of you are way too good for this shit, but I think I've got it figured it out. We're gonna do exactly what he was gonna do to me. And if the police ever find out, we stick to our stories, just like real friends. Good plan, Brad. Fuck you! You're sure the quarry is the best place? Yeah. His family dumps bodies there. Sweet fucking Jesus. Guys... please don't tell anyone about Mindy. She's the best thing that ever happened to me. [cries] ["Indication" by The Zombies playing] I never thought this could happen to us. Hurry up! I skeeve dead people! You're the best friend I could ask for. Let's just get this over with. I need to report a shooting. [police car siren wailing] [Jonnie] No, fuck, no. Fuck! [policeman] Put your hands where I can see them! You guys are coming with me! Put your hands on the car now! Go! Fucking cake eaters. [gate closes] So you said you were close to Dr. Szyzmanski? She-- She saw me as, you know, as a son. And I just really depended on her. A to Z. I want the whole story now. You better hope the other two tell us the same exact thing. Yes, sir. This relationship. It never-- It never became an affair? It was never a sexual thing? No. When did you find out that Brad was fucking Dr. Szyzmanski? I don't have any knowledge of Brad sleeping with Dr. Szyzmanski. -[cop] Yes, you do. -There was no sexual relations. -What do you know? You know, Brad, I've been looking at you now for a while since you came in the station. And you, you honestly have one of the most punchable faces I've ever seen. Fucking piece of shit, none of this is making any sense. Why was Mr. Tomasetti up your ass? Tomasetti found out that Brad had been going over to Dr. Szyzmanski's to talk and he got jealous. He took me into his car. He put a gun in his mouth. Tomasetti attacked me. He said that he would-- he would kill him, tie a cement block to his leg and drop him in the middle of the quarry. If you go back into his car, I guarantee you the gun is still there, and you can test the DNA. -Murder! -Do you wanna be your mother? Do you wanna be the rest of your fucking family? You got the golden fucking ticket right now and you're screwing around. You're messing it up! Was it your idea to have a gun? We needed some sort of protection. He's much bigger than us. So I brought the hunting rifle not to fucking do anything with it. -You set him up. -Self-defense. So where did it go wrong? You're talking things out. Where did we go horribly wrong that he's dead? I'd never seen anything like this before. There was a hate in his eye. He became an animal. He shot him because he was attacking me. Maybe he attacked Jonnie, started strangling Jonnie when Jonnie puts a gun in his face? He knocked the gun out of my hands, put me against the wall, was beating the shit out of me. He grabs his nuts. He's gonna-- He's-- he's gonna rip his nuts off. He grabbed him by the nuts. And then he grabbed my nuts. The gun got in my hands after Tomasetti knocked it out of Jonnie's hands. So, why'd you have to shoot him? Because I didn't have a choice! Look out for yourself, man. How did it feel when you pulled the trigger? Did you get off to it? Just trust me when I say I had no other choice. Fuck, you're sorry! I'm telling you the truth! I'm telling you what happened! Why were you going to the quarry? They got scared and freaked out about it and didn't know what to do. We brought the body there. All right? That's-- Yeah, that is the worst thing that we did. You're a sick shit! [Brad] That's not what happened. I've told you so many times. He's dead! You're not telling me anything that helps you! Prison isn't gonna be kind to a person like you, Jonnie. You're standing up for the wrong person right now. No one's coming to save you, Levin. You're your only help right now. I can't help you. Your father can't help you. Your buddies sure as hell ain't. [somber music plays] [gate closes] [somber music plays] [cop sighs] Yinz guys' stories matches up exactly to Dr. Szyzmanski's. Goddamn lucky she came in here. [Jonnie] Jesus Christ, no! No, no, no! [Brad] Shane. What? We did it. We stayed together. We won. [Shane] No, we didn't. [somber music plays] What are you doing? I'm getting a glass of milk. Oh. That'll help you sleep. I'm still getting used to it here. I can get that for you. [Lucas] Okay. Thanks. I used to have trouble sleeping. Do you want a grilled cheese? Who are you? [Mindy] Lucas! Get out of my house! Mindy, who is this? I didn't know. Please leave right now. But he's nice. I just wanted to talk. Lucas, please go and get in bed, honey, okay? It's okay. Go ahead and go get in bed. Mom will be right up, come in and check on you, okay? Go on. Go on to bed. Go, get in bed. You should be in jail. So should you. Just leave my house and never come back. We'll leave it at that. Don't you think you owe me an explanation? No. You got everything you hoped for. As always. What more could you possibly want? Thank you for coming to the police station to save us. I've been-- I have to take care of my son now. God forbid, he turn out anything like you. Mindy. I wish my mom came back for me. [somber music plays]
