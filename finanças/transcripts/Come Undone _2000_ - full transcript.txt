ALMOST NOTHING This is it, I've left. I'm on the train. It feels weird going back there. I'm doing what you said. You coming? Was it good today? - Yeah. Is mom sleeping? - Keep quiet. She had trouble falling asleep. Come on! Just try to relax. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Everything's fine. The tube is going in. Swallow your saliva. One hard swallow. Calm down, sir. Everything's fine. Breathe. Calm down. Breathe... Everything's fine. Don't get upset. Try to remain calm. Breathe! You're too tense. Please breathe, sir. Breathe! You're not helping... Breathe. You must stay calm. Here, Mathieu, put it under your arm. Like that. You haven't eaten anything! That's not good. You need your strength. You did take your tranquilizers? Mathieu Lambert's fiberscope? It was hard, but I think we got it. I'll see him this afternoon. Then we'll discuss treatment. OK. - See you later. How do you feel, Mathieu? Were the tests all right this morning? It would be good if we talked, don't you think? You don't want to taIk? Fine. Let me tel you what's going to happen. If you want, only if you agree to it, you can stay here for eight days. That's the usual procedure, when people come to the hospital. We try to keep them for eight days, to find out what's wrong. See what made you do what you did... and try to find some answers. I'm a psychiatrist, I'm here to help you. You are safe here. You can get yourself together. Do you want to let anyone know you're here? Your parents, maybe? You know the person who brought you here yesterday? He's been here twice today, asking about you. Is he a friend? Is he your boyfriend? C?dric. Mathieu. - Nice to meet you. You on vacation long here? I don't know. A while. What's so funny? You. - Me? I make you laugh? - You do. Why? - I didn't picture you like this. Like how? I saw you last year. You've really changed. I've seen you, too. You sold waffles in that van? I still do, but at Pingolo's. Know where it is? Pingolo's? - Yeah. I don't think so. Got friends here? Not really. Want one? A friend? - Yeah, a friend. You, for example? Me, for example. Sure, why not? Did you mind me looking at you on the beach? No. I looked at you, too. Yeah, I noticed. Why? Because you were looking at me. The girl's your sister? - Yes. You look alike. Really! You didn't look closely enough. Maybe you had better things to do. Here, right now, I don't know if I could... But yesterday on the beach, you felt something? I'm not saying I didn't, but... I don't know, maybe you're right. I'd better leave, then. Wait, isn't it normal? What do you propose? What do I propose, right now? I want to kiss you. Go ahead. Just getting in now? - I went for a walk. At three in the morning! What's wrong? The pills make you sick, that's all... Feel good? What are you waiting for? What did you say? Nothing. Hey, Mathieu. Please go away. Why? So they don't see us together. Are you ashamed or what? No, I just don't want any trouble! What trouble? Can't you just leave? You think I'm stupid? - Just fuck off! What, fuck off? Who's he talking to? One of Mouchereau's sons? Must be. What are they up to? Well... I'm going. I'm baking out here. I've got lots to do at home. I'll take the car, you'll walk, OK? Yeah. You'll come back in an hour? Yes. Sarah, I'm not your maid. You can help. Why don't you ask Mathieu? He's too lazy. Sure, that's some excuse. I'm lazy too, then. There are so many people on that beach. Even at low tide, it's packed. Don't be dumb, it's always the same! Don't talk to me like that! My allergies are starting, shit. I won't go back. I'm sick of the beach anyway. You're not supposed to go everyday... You piss me off! Why aren't you eating? - I'm not hungry. I bust my ass to feed you! I'm going to my room. Let him go, his ass hurts. - Mathieu, wait! Excuse me, is C?dric here? No, he left. A long time ago? About two hours. What do you want? To apologize for this afternoon. OK, you can fuck off now. Cut it out. Hey, I said I'm sorry! Come on... Come on, kiss me. Don't ever do it again! You hear me? Ashes from the moon, little ball of foam, the wind carries me, the hot sand buries me. Between my dunes lie my misfortunes. When I'm nude, I learn virtue! I, I, I'm so fragile! Someone take my hand... That's pathetic. I, I, I'm so easy, I fuck anyone who wants me! We'll have to be careful next time, or my sister'll flip. She doesn't seem too cool. She's a real bitch these days. Carried by the wind, I fuck you up the ass My ass is afraid to be pricked by your big bad dick! Naked, I take it up the ass. I, I, I'm a libertine, I'm a whore... A naughty girl... Her ass is nice and hairy... ...the way I like it! Kitty! Where did you come from? Shit! Hey, get down. Here. You're cute, but you stink. Here, You little pig! It's good, huh? Well, I'm here. I'm sitting by the fire. It's so cold here. I saw the neighbor. She gave me the wood. I hope she won't call here. It's freezing! I'd Iike you to come one weekend, I could show you the place. I think you'd Iike it. Don't know what I'll do this week. Today I found a cat. He was in the yard. He's sleeping now. Here. Thanks, dear, but I prefer orange juice. Feeling better? Not really. Those pills make you sick. You should stop. Don't worry, it won't last. Shit! Oh, fuck! SeriousIy. You want a light! Excuse me. Give it to me. No, I'll Iight it. That's what it's for. I'm so full... Fuck, I'm fat. It's awful. You, too? - Totally. Welcome to the club. - You've gained? A Iittle. - No way! Your food's so rich. - It's so rich! Right! It's not only disgusting, it also makes you fat. I can't cook. Is it really too salty? It's salty. - I like salt. The food is already salted, so there's no point adding to it. Yeah, but I like it that way. Like it? You garbage disposal! I like salt! Salt, and pepper. I like spices. Here's Annick trying to justify her cooking. I didn't make it! I bought it. I couldn't make that cake. She got it at the bakery. - I just got the wrong bakery! You would! - Which one? Get off my back! - Which bakery? The one next to the bar... That's not the good one. So I was wrong. - Change bakeries. You're all horrible. - No, we love you, Annick. Be careful. Two with sugar? Thanks, have a nice day. This game's a drag. - Come on, play! One last round. Three of a kind. If you get four, I'll suck your dick. And if not? - Just your balls, then! Your dad may come next weekend. Let him stay in Paris. - Why? He doesn't take care of her. He's like all men. A coward, afraid of illness. Why defend him? He's isn't nice to you. I don't care what he says. As long as he needs me, I'm stronger. That's how it works with him. Why aren't you at the beach with Sarah? I'm sick of her! Maybe you've met a girl. - No. Re-do it. It's sloppy. - No, it's OK. Fuck! I don't believe it... Shit! Mathieu, are you there? Why'd you lock the door? We were playing darts. I forgot. Aren't you going to introduce us? C?dric, Annick. Where's your sister? - I don't know. The beach, I guess. Come help me clean the kitchen. You made a big mess! Now? - Yes. I can't do anything. Want to eat with us, C?dric? She's doing better, but sometimes she breaks down. She needs to stop the pills. Just come! I know you're busy but Christ! I'm not judging you, but she needs you. They fight all the time. Want to talk to him? Known each other long? About ten days. We met at the beach. You're from here? - Yeah. From Nantes, actuaIIy. My dad Iives here. I'm on vacation. Are you in schooI? No, I quit a Iong time ago. It's not my thing. On the doIe, then? - No, why? I start a training course in September. The pay's bad, but I'II Iearn a trade. Is it mechanics? No, I'm not a mechanic. - You Iook Iike one though. I'm just kidding! It's computers. - Ah, computers. A friend in Paris does news graphics. Yeah? I've aIways Ioved that. I don't know anything about it! I shouId dress. I can't go down Iike this. Wearthe sweater Sarah and I gave you. If you Iike. It's in the cIoset. Dad caIIed. He can't come, he has to go to Frankfort. Did you hear me? - Yes. You don't care? No. But you know, he works a Iot. He doesn't give a shit about us. You're wrong. He's doing the best he can. So, it's OK he Ieft you afterwhat happened? Good evening. C?dric, my mom. - Nice to meet you. Like some wine? I'd Iike a IittIe. If Annick doesn't mind? - Annick doesn't mind. But not too much! Thanks. Is it good? A bit off. - Yeah, it is. So you're Mathieu's new friend? That's for sure! WouId you get the starters? Are you in schooI? - Not exactIy. I seII waffIes. ReaIIy? Have you been doing it Iong? - Three years. So... what do you do in winter? Not much. Just hang out. I do sports, too. It shows. You're reaIIy buiIt! You think so? - Yes! You must be popuIar at the beach. Trying to find out if he's free? We're too oId for him! Too oId! I think you Iook good for your age. That's a good one! So, what's my age? I don't know. I couIdn't say. Yes, you couId! - No, no. How oId is your girIfriend? She's... - Eighteen! You know her? A IittIe. Mathieu reaIIy knows her! - Shut up! Don't taIk to your sister Iike that. She shouId mind her business! I aIways wanted a sister. It's not aIways great. EspeciaIIy with these two. Right, Sarah? So... Who wants some? - SaIad, C?dric? Yes. Some deIicious saIad! That's enough. Thanks. No more? - No, thanks. Sarah? I don't want any. Want some quiche? - Let her be. I'm the onIy one who Iikes my food here! I'II have more. Get out. - OK, we're going. What asshoIes! They wouIdn't throw him out. Stop it. - Stop what? Shut up. I'm sorry. Come on, forget it. Kiss me. Fuck! - What is it? He's Iooking aII over for you. Is he the one you sIept with? Yeah. He's why you Ieft for Nantes? Yeah, but not just him. Too much shit was going on. What kind of shit? I don't want to taIk about it. TeII me. Sure you want to know? - Yes, I want to know. I tried it for money with some guys passing through. Wasn't it disgusting? It depended on the guy. One time was reaIIy awfuI. The guy was a gay-basher. He beat the crap out of me. But that's aII over now. Why do you think he did it? I don't know. ShouIdn't you teII me? It's hard to say, exactIy. I think it's a combination of things. In any case, it's not about you. So why the Ietter saying he wouIdn't see me anymore? Depression doesn't Ieave much room for others. But I couId heIp him. - Not if he doesn't want heIp. For now, he needs to find himseIf. On his own. I don't get it, he seemed fine. He may have feIt the need to hide it from you. Can I ask you a question? You don't have to answer. Yes. How were things between you? I mean, were there any sexuaI inhibitions? No, not reaIIy. But this past month he hasn't wanted to. He accused me of cheating. It wasn't true? - No... Just once, but it was nothing. Otherwise, things were good? - Yeah, fine. We argued, Iike everybody. And at night? Mathieu said he had troubIe sIeeping. Mathieu, want to go for a ride? Right now? We're aII aIone. ''Today, Ranrou?t shows us the evoIution of miIitary architecture. It mixes styIes from the 10th through the 17th centuries. We can foIIow its transformations to a time when past principIes and forms were abandoned.'' CooI. No, not here. - Why not? I'm not in the mood. - You mad? No, but you've got a one-track mind! Isn't that normaI? Come on, stop it. I don't Iike you Iike this. Is it because of yesterday? I don't know. We're here, can't you enjoy it? It's just a bunch of rocks! I want you. I don't feeI Iike it! I'II be Iate. Don't Iock the door. Wait! - What? You think I haven't figured it out? What do you mean? You know what I mean. And you bring him here, on top of it. You want to kiII your mother? I'm not doing anything bad! Do what you want, it's your ass. But you couId stay for dinner sometimes. But... - Make an effort. I can't. He's waiting. TeII him you'II see him after dinner. How are you? Fine, honey. It goes too fast. - What? It goes too fast. I didn't know she had a guy. Neither did I. Let's go. I'm bored. WiII your mom take it bad? I don't know. She's not weII, so I don't want to upset her. She's sick? - No, it's just... She had a baby 3 years ago, born with cancer. They couIdn't save him. He's dead? We buried him recentIy. My mom's been Iike this since. We Iook after her. MostIy Annick does. It doesn't seem to affect you. I hardIy knew him. He was aIways at the hospitaI. So? She hasn't paid much attention to us since. Isn't that normaI? I know, but... it's heII at home. Between my crazy sister and my depressed mom, I've had enough. They know you're gay? I didn't even know myseIf, before... Didn't you do stuff when you were IittIe? Come on. I undressed aII my cousins! Bitch! You're so warm. You Iike that. 6 francs a kiIo. Anything cheaper? I've got some at 5 francs a kiIo. I'II take a kiIo. Here you are. Anything eIse? How much are the tomatoes? 12 francs a kiIo. Excuse me. I came about the ad. Do you stiII need someone? I don't need a waiter, it's for cIeaning. I know, but I can do that too. How oId are you? - I'm nineteen. From around here? - Pornichet. There's a Iot of work. Tons! That's aIright. I can do it. It's so noisy! Are you at home? Yes, the window's open. They're working in the street. How's it going with C?dric? Fine. As usuaI. He's at work right now. You sound funny. Sure you're aIright? Yes, I'm fine. Good. What eIse is going on? Not much. I just wanted to see how you're doing. I'm fine, dear. StiII a IittIe tired, but OK... When are you coming? We shouId introduce C?dric to your dad. I aIready said I don't want to. C?dric's not into famiIies. Whatever you say. We'II see Iater. I miss you. I miss aII of you. I gotta go. We don't have much money, but I'II caII again. Open up, Mathieu, I know you're in there. Come on, damn it! Open up. I know you're there. Open the fucking door! Come on Mathieu, pIease! Looking for someone? When she waIks by, she goes to the other side. She doesn't even say hi! She pretends not to know him. Or us. - We're not her friends anymore. She finds you drunk every night. That's not it. She's mad at us. I gotta go before they wake up. Why aren't you saying anything? What do you want me to say? You sIeeping with C?dric? Yes. Isn't it gross? No. Was he Iike that before? Yes. Are you in Iove? The tree trunks turn you on? No, you do. The IittIe boy is buck naked! That dog's hungry. I know a grotto. It's hard to get to, but beautifuI. Want to see it? Yeah, but I can't get back too Iate, or I'II be in troubIe. I've been coming home Iate for a whiIe now. It's not very far. I'II caII you from down there. C?dric, you down there? Fuck, where are you? You're waiting for C?dric? Yes. I'm his father. What's your name? Mathieu. Do you know how he is? No. I've been waiting 2 hours, they haven't toId me. Are you his boyfriend? Yes. You're not from here? No. I'm on vacation. I'm from Paris. Are you aIright? What happened? I feII on the rocks. At Korigans' Grotto. You're pretty messed up. Does it hurt? - I'm aIright. May I sit down? - Of course. Not a great room, huh? Can you pick him up Monday? I'm working. Yes, of course. Don't worry. WeII, goodbye. See you soon, I hope. We were on the rocks. I waited for him at the hospitaI. What happened? Nothing serious? No. He was very Iucky. Thank God. You couId have caIIed me. I was so worried. Mom, I have to teII you something. What is it, honey? It's not easy. I don't want to hurt you. Why do you say that? You won't hurt me. Go on, teII me. I know you're sick and... Stop taIking Iike I'm sick! It's true that sometimes, I'm a IittIe down. Go on, teII me. I Iove C?dric. I reaIIy Iove him, mom. What about him? I think he Ioves me, too. I feeI it, anyway. What about NathaIie? What, NathaIie? - Yes, NathaIie. Is that over? - That was no big deaI! ReaIIy? I kind of suspected this. - What do you mean? The other day, in the haIIway, I heard you. You were in the middIe of... Anyway. See, I'm not that out of it! I never said you were. At the hospitaI, your dad asked me if we were together. I feIt dumb, I didn't know what to say. ShouId've toId him you were my girI! You jerk! To our marriage, then! Why didn't your mom come? My mother? She's a waIking piece of shit. She's in Rouen. Haven't seen her in 15 years. She nevertook care of me. My parents divorced when I was one. She's nevertried to contact me. Can you beIieve that? Didn't your dad do anything? No. What couId he do? Has he remarried since? No. He didn't want the troubIe. Women come and go, they never stay Iong. He's with a reaI bitch right now. That's why I Ieft. And why'd you Ieave schooI? SchooI's not my thing. I dropped out nearthe end. Want to go to my dad's tonight? He's at her pIace. Oh, at his age... That's just it. At his age, you faII in Iove. AIready home? Yeah, why? No reason. It's earIy for you. Anything wrong? - No, why? I don't know. Why won't you take your piIIs? I want to stop. We can Iowerthe doses, but it's risky to stop coId. You don't think you need them? If I don't stop, I'II never know. We'II stop them progressiveIy. What wiII you do there? I don't know, I'II see... I mostIy want to rest. Can you handIe being aII aIone? I think so. Anyway, I know peopIe there. What about C?dric? It's over for me. Are you sure? - Yes. I feeI Iike I need to be aIone. So you can think? No. I don't want to think about anything now. Later on, maybe. The sea wiII be good for you. Mathieu, I want to suggest something. WhiIe you're there, I'd Iike you to keep a journaI, write down your feeIings. I'm not into writing. But maybe. You'II be aIright? I'm a IittIe scared to Ieave the hospitaI. The streets, peopIe... That's normaI. But everything wiII be fine. Hey, you aIright? What's up? When are you Ieaving? For Paris? - Yeah, for Paris. In three or four days. I want you to stay. You hear me? I want you to stay with me. So, it didn't mean anything? What can I do? Think I'II be waiting for you to caII? I know you won't. I expected more from you. You know I can't, with my mother. Fuck off! You make me sick. C?dric starts a job soon. In computers. We'II Iive in Nantes. What about you? Your studies? I'II just register at the University here. It's the same difference. Trust me. How can I trust you? This is so sudden. What if you don't get aIong with him? What if it doesn't work out? I'II finish the schooI year, then move back to Paris. What about money? I'II find a job. Where, on the streets? Why do you say that? Mom... He's not with you? Mom toId me you're staying. I'm going to Nantes with C?dric. You're crazy! I don't want to taIk about it. You hardIy know him. - So? Maybe in a week, you'II hate him. You don't know anyone there. That's my probIem. Did you teII NicoIas? No, I thought you couId teII him. I'II write him a Ietter, anyway. Why, are you afraid? Just teII him. Can't you do that? You're a coward. But I can see why. When he finds out you're a fag, he'II fIip! Get Iost! A pint, pIease. Eat this. Here. Take it easy. You're Iooking good. You're my IittIe Prince Charming. HeIIo. Uh, is Pierre home? Pierre? Not at this hour. He Ieaves work around four. He'II be here soon then, it's quarterto. Oh, yes! In this weather, it's hard to teII. Want to wait for him? You don't mind? - Not at aII. Have a seat. WouId you Iike a coffee? It's coId out. No, thanks. I just had one an hour ago. Do you mind if I keep ironing? - No, go right ahead. Have you known Pierre Iong? Two years. We met two years ago. Are you from Pornichet? No, I'm from Nantes. But I've spent aII my summers here, on vacation. Do you work? Not yet. I'm continuing my education. What are you studying? - Architecture. That must be great, huh? I mean, I wouId think so. Yeah, I Iike it. You sure you don't want a coffee or something? OK, a coffee. It's not strong, or I couIdn't take it. Pierre, there's a friend here for you. What are you doing here? On vacation? No, not reaIIy. In fact, I moved into my parents house. What's going on? Nothing, I was just passing. He's been waiting haIf an hour. Want to take a waIk? - In this coId? It's OK, it's stiII dayIight. Got brothers and sisters? - No. My mom had a hard time having me. WouIdn't you Iike your own pIace? And be aII aIone? I've got time. My parents are cooI. I don't have the money. My boss couId fire me anytime. I'd ratherwait. Think I'm Iame? Not at aII. You seem reaIIy together. My friends aII quit schooI... ...to be independent. End resuIt: they're Iost. Didn't you quit schooI? Yes, but I worked right away. I work in construction. I'm a mason. It's hard, but it's betterthan doing nothing. What about you? We're onIy taIking about me. Why did you come here? I needed to get some air. Did C?dric come with you? - No. Did you guys come this summer? C?dric didn't want to, because of my parents. Can I ask you something? What happened between you two? You don't have to answer. No, I don't mind. I've nevertaIked to anyone about it. At the time, I'd onIy been with girIs. Then I met C?dric. That's it. So what happened? I was with a girI, so it was hard. I had to choose, and I chickened out. Do you regret it now? - No. It wouIdn't have Iasted. I wasn't ready. So why do you guys aIways fight? It's compIicated... Since it ended in a fucked-up way, we can't seem to heIp it. It's been a year, year and a haIf? - Yeah. You've changed. You're more... More what? - I don't know. Less of a kid. - ReaIIy? Going back to Nantes? - No, I'm not. Anyway not now. I think I'II spend the winter here. How's schooI going? Fine. I don't want to taIk about me today. I'm sorry, but... But I'm gIad to see you. It's good you came by. Look at that kid. What's he doing aII aIone? Look, that must be his dad. Want to have dinnertonight? - Sure. I know a pizzeria nearby. - OK. Are you stiII with C?dric? No. Has it been Iong? No, not Iong. Are you with anyone? - You know, around here... You go to Nantes? Yeah, sometimes, but... I don't Iike the peopIe there. Here, doggy! Go on! Kick it!
