Man: ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID IT BEST-- "IT IS COMMON ENOUGH "THAT WE TRIUMPH UNDER ADVERSITY, "BUT... "IF YOU TRULY WISH TO TEST A MAN'S CHARACTER... GIVE HIM POWER." Blake: "THE OBJECT OF EDUCATION IS TO KNOW A REVOLUTION WHEN YOU SEE ONE." WHEN RANDOLPH BOURNE WROTE THIS IN 1916, WROTE THIS IN 1916, REVOLUTIONS WERE POLITICAL, A SOCCER MATCH BETWEEN THE BOLSHEVIKS AND WOODROW WILSON'S IDEA, A DREAM FOR DEMOCRACY. WHAT WE HAD AT THE END OF THE CENTURY WAS...A FREE-FOR-ALL. [KIDS LAUGHING] Announcer: YOU ARE WATCHING ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION AND COMMENTARY. ALL NEWS, ALL ENTERTAINMENT, 24 HOURS A DAY. GOOD EVENING. IT'S HALF PAST THE HOUR, AND I'M BREE SANDERS. INDEPENDENCE DAY IS COMING EARLY IN THE AMERICAN HEARTLAND THIS YEAR AS THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR HEATS UP WITH A PECULIAR TWIST. ETC's OWN CELA BRANDINI HAS THE STORY. CALL IT A WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. ON THE ONE HAND, A WHITE KNIGHT, INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR BLAKE PELLARIN. ON THE OTHER, WHAT SOME CALL A WHITE NIGHTMARE, THE EQUALLY INDEPENDENT HOMER DIX. BETWEEN THEM, THEY HAVE DESTROYED ANY CHANCE OF A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN VICTORY. FOR 2 INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES TO BE BATTLING OVER HIGH OFFICE AT THE TURN OF A NEW CENTURY MAY BE SIGNIFICANT, MEANING THE END OF THE 2-PARTY SYSTEM IN AMERICAN POLITICS AND THE BEGINNING OF WHAT BLAKE PELLARIN CALLS "A NEW ERA OF INDEPENDENCE." Blake: LOOK, EVERYBODY... LOOK... I AM NOT TELLING YOU HOW TO DO YOUR JOBS. FOR ME... EDUCATORS ARE THE REAL LEADERS IN THIS COUNTRY. I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE TODAY IF IT WASN'T FOR THE PEOPLE WHO TAUGHT ME. SO MANY CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE... I HEARD IT FROM THE LIMO. THIS IS NOT THE SPEECH. SAILING OFF THE MAP AGAIN. WHY MUST YOUR BETTER HALF ALWAYS ELECT TO IMPROVISE? MY EARLY LIFE... WAS CHAOS. GROWING UP, FIRST WITHOUT A--WITHOUT A FATHER, AND THEN WITHOUT A MOTHER-- AN ORPHAN-- I WAS LITERALLY SAVED BY SCHOOL, AND I PROMISE YOU, AS GOVERNOR, I WILL REPAY THAT DEBT. EDUCATION IS NOT AN ABSTRACT IDEA TO ME. IT IS A LIFELINE. [APPLAUSE] HOW CAN WE EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN... SHOULDN'T YOU BE UP THERE, TOO, MA'AM? OH... APPARENTLY, MY TIRELESSLY ADORING STARE MAKES MY HUSBAND NERVOUS. TEACHERS NEED TO BE BETTER PAID! Dinah: HE LIKENS MY EYES TO 2 LIGHTLY POACHED EGGS. EDUCATION IS LIFE! TEACHERS NEED TO BE BETTER PAID. [APPLAUSE CONTINUES] THEY NEED BETTER FACILITIES. EDUCATION IS LIFE. YOU CAN COUNT ON ME TO BE THERE FOR YOU. YOU CAN COUNT ON IT. WELL, THEY'RE NOT SO BAD, YOU KNOW. YEAH. HE'S GOT THEM. NO, YOUR EYES. Blake: SO, I TAKE IT YOU LISTENED. CRITICISMS? WHERE DO I START? Dinah: CAREFUL, GARNE. ONLY 2 HOURS TO ST. LOUIS. FIRST, DON'T SAY "SOCCER MATCH." "A SOCCER MATCH BETWEEN THE BOLSHEVIKS AND WOODROW WILSON"? SOCCER'S A GAME FOR EUROPEANS AND FAGGOTS, BLAKE. THIS IS AMERICA. SAY "FOOTBALL." Dinah: DO YOU HAVE TO SAY "REVOLUTION"? IT WORKED FOR GEORGE WASHINGTON. GEORGE WASHINGTON WASN'T RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR OF MISSOURI. YOU SOUNDED VERY PRESIDENTIAL, PUMPKIN. THE OBJECT IS TO WIN THE STATE, NOT SECEDE IT FROM THE UNION. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU EVEN BOTHER HAVING ME FOR A SPEECHWRITER. 'CAUSE YOU'RE GIFTED AND HOSTILE. BLAKE LIKES YOU, GARNE. YOU'RE NOT A YES-MAN. THAT'S RIGHT. I DESPISE YES-MEN. DON'T I, KINZEL? YES, SIR. [LAUGHING] YAY! PELLARIN FOR GOVERNOR. WHOO! RIGHT BEHIND YOU, BLAKE! PELLARIN FOR GOVERNOR. PELLARIN FOR GOVERNOR! RIGHT BEHIND YOU, BLAKE! GOOD JOB, BLAKE! GOOD JOB! YEAH! ETC anchorwoman: LAST WEEK, AS THE PELLARIN JUGGERNAUT ROLLED EAST FROM KANSAS CITY, ETC's OWN STEAMROLLER CELA BRANDINI FLEW SOUTH TO CUBA AND TOURED THE DEEP PAST OF THIS POLITICAL MYSTERY MAN. IF ANY ONE MAN CAN BE SAID TO HAVE A SPECIAL INSIGHT INTO THIS RACE, IT IS THE FLAMBOYANT FORMER SENATOR FROM RHODE ISLAND KIMBALL ADAMS MENNAKER. A DESCENDANT OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, BOYHOOD FRIEND OF ROBERT KENNEDY, MENNAKER WAS, IN HIS YOUTH, A CONFIDANTE OF MANY WORLD LEADERS. HE MADE HIMSELF WELL-KNOWN IN HIS OWN RIGHT AS A CONTROVERSIAL POLITICAL HERETIC OF THE KENNEDY-NIXON ERA. TURN IT OFF. NO. LET'S SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. IT'S WHAT YOU GOT NOW IS A SINGLE-PARTY SYSTEM OF THE RICH. AND I'M AFRAID WHAT MY FORMER YOUNG FRIEND MR. BLAKE PELLARIN AND HIS ADMIRABLE NEMESIS MR. DIX HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY ARE BOTH UNCOMMONLY WEALTHY. WHERE IS THE INDEPENDENCE THERE? Brandini: IT IS WELL-KNOWN THAT MENNAKER HAS SPENT THE LAST 2 DECADES LIVING IN SELF-IMPOSED EXILE IN HAVANA, CUBA. WHAT IS LESS KNOWN IS THAT HE SERVED AS A VIRTUAL STEPFATHER TO THE YOUNG BLAKE PELLARIN. Mennaker: NO, I THINK, UH... "STEPFATHER" IS A BIT STRONG. HIS ACTUAL FATHER WAS VERY DEAR TO ME. I MERELY--AS WAS INDEED HIS MOTHER-- I MERELY SAW TO YOUNG BLAKE'S EDUCATION AFTER HE WAS ORPHANED, YOU KNOW. BUT THEN HE BROKE WITH YOU, EVEN DESTROYED YOU, POLITICALLY. NO, NO, NO. I DESTROYED MYSELF POLITICALLY. BLAKE ONLY DESTROYED ME COMMERCIALLY. BLAKE CANCELED MY SYNDICATED RADIO PROGRAM AFTER HIS WIFE BOUGHT THAT VAST MEDIA EMPIRE... I FIRED YOU, YOU GAY BASTARD. HE QUIT BEFORE YOU HAD THE CHANCE, REMEMBER, SWEETHEART? I NOW BOMBARD FLORIDA WITH MY VIEWS. IS THIS A MICROPHONE OR AN INNUENDO? I'M SORRY, I CAN'T WATCH. YOU'RE NOT BITTER? NO, NO, NO. I HAD ALWAYS ENCOURAGED BLAKE TO BE INDEPENDENT, AND NOW HE SPEAKS OF REVOLUTION WITH THE FIERY ZEAL OF A MAN OF THE PEOPLE. NO, BLAKE IS A DAVID WHO DOESN'T SEEM TO GRASP THAT HE'S BECOME A GOLIATH. THE MORE HE TEARS YOU DOWN, THE MORE HE TEES YOU UP, LOVER. HE KNOWS THAT. HE KNOWS WHAT? KIM... KNOWS HE'S BUILDING ME UP. OR SETTING ME UP... FOR GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT. Mennaker: BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN BOY... BEAUTIFUL... FATHERLESS AMERICAN BOY. OH, I'M SO STONED ON YOU... AMY... LEAVE OFF DEVOURING THAT SPLENDID HEIRLOOM. LUCIUS, TAKE HER PLACE. NO! OH! YOU'RE PUNISHING ME. Lucius: MY BROTHER... MUCH BETTER. Blake: TEACHERS NEED TO BE BETTER PAID. WE NEED... BETTER FACILITIES... EDUCATION IS LIFE! COUNT ON ME TO BE THERE FOR YOU. YOU CAN COUNT ON ME. COUNT ON IT! Mennaker: RISE AND SHINE, MY BEAUTEOUS BILLY BOY. DON'T WATCH YOUR BROTHER ON THAT BOX. HIGH TIME WE SAW HIM IN PERSON. AND WON'T HE BE SURPRISED? YOUR BROTHER SO NEEDS TO BE SURPRISED. THIS IS CELA BRANDINI REPORTING FOR ETC-- DEAR HEART... ARE YOU READY TO GO? HMM? THAT'S MY BILLY BOY. [LAUGHTER] Man: YOU KNOW, BLAKE, THE WORD "DESPAIR" CROPPED UP TWICE IN YOUR SPEECH TO THE TEACHERS. HOW MANY TIMES DID THE WORD "THE" CROP UP? [LAUGHTER] I BLAME MY SPEECHWRITER FOR THAT. HE LOOKED VERY DEPRESSED YESTERDAY. BUT SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE DO DESPAIR ABOUT GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THERE'S A WIDESPREAD BELIEF THAT POWER CAN ONLY BE BOUGHT NOW. BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING, BLAKE? AREN'T YOU RICH? OH, YEAH, BUT THAT'S LUCK, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, I MARRIED MY COLLEGE SWEETHEART. SHE JUST HAPPENED TO BE RICHER THAN GOD. [LAUGHTER] BUT I'M NOT--I'M NOT HERE TO PROMOTE... DESPAIR. I'M NOT HERE TO PROTECT GOVERNMENT BY THE RICH. HOMER DIX HAS BEEN HINTING THAT HE'S GOT THE GOODS ON YOU. OH, IS THAT RIGHT? WELL, I'M GLAD SOMEBODY DOES. [LAUGHTER] I CHOOSE NOT TO BELIEVE IN HINTS. I PREFER A RED-BLOODED RUMOR ANYTIME. THANK YOU. OH, I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO GO. YEAH. I'M LATE AS IT IS. Woman: THANKS, BLAKE. I'LL BUY YOU AN ICE CREAM CONE LATER. WHO IS, UH, "RAYMOND ROMERO? "RAY... RAYMOND ROMERO?" YOU DO KNOW THE NAME. I KNOW LOTS OF NAMES. EVEN YOURS, MS... I'M CELA BRANDINI. OH, YEAH. YOU'RE THE CNN CORRESPONDENT THEY CALL THE DESERT FOX. I REMEMBER THAT INTERVIEW YOU DID WITH HUSSEIN DURING THE GULF WAR. I'M NOW REINVENTING MYSELF AS AN AMERICAN CORRESPONDENT FOR ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION COMMENTARY. CNN TO ETC. THAT'S TRADING DOWN. DEPENDS ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW. I AM NOW FREE TO CREATE AN ENTIRE NEWS DIVISION. YOU CREATE THE NEWS, WHILE I... PROVIDE THE ENTERTAINMENT. IS THAT THE DEAL? I'VE CONVINCED MY VIEWERS THAT YOU'RE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. TELL THEM TO ELECT ME GOVERNOR FIRST. PERHAPS THEY WILL... IF YOU CAN TELL ME... WHO IS RAYMOND ROMERO? TELL THEM I'M WONDERING MYSELF. WE MUST ALL BE CRAZY GETTING UP THIS EARLY! GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? [INDISTINCT] WHAT? OK. GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? HOW ARE YOU? MAKE SURE TO VOTE FOR ME. BILLY? BILLY? Brandini: WHO IS RAYMOND ROMERO? DON'T GO... YOU DON'T HAVE TO. DON'T LEAVE. THE OLD MAN WON'T LIKE THAT. FUCK THE OLD MAN! [RATTLING] LOOK, YOU AND KINZEL ARE NEVER TO LET BLAKE OUT OF YOUR SIGHT. REMEMBER THE RUCKUS WITH THAT WOMAN IN CAPE GIRARDEAU? BLAKE ASKED ME TO GET HIM A DOUBLE SHOT OF ESPRESSO. OH, WONDERFUL. I GOT HIM A DOUBLE SHOT OF ESPRESSO. SIR, YOUR ESPRESSO. IT'S COLD, SIR. I-- BLAKE, WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GO? GARNE, YOU SEE THIS HOMELESS MAN? GIVE HIM A COUPLE OF BUCKS. ISN'T IT A BIT EARLY IN THE DAY FOR LIBERAL GUILT? I'VE ONLY GOT 20s. GIVE HIM ONE. OR 2. GUILT IS BEAUTIFUL, BABY. [SPEAKING SPANISH] I AM SOMEBODY ELSE. HELLO, BLAKE. YOU JUST GOT UP THERE IN FRONT OF 300 PEOPLE, AND WHAT DID YOU DO? YOU PLAYED HAMLET. GIVE ME A BREAK. I DIDN'T EVEN QUOTE HAMLET. YOU GOT UP THERE LOOKING AND TALKING LIKE A MAN WHO'D SEEN A GHOST! WHO IS RAYMOND ROMERO? HE'S A TRICK, PLAYED BY KIM MENNAKER. OH, GREAT! WELL, THEN, HERE'S THE $60 BILLION BONUS QUESTION-- BLAKE, ARE YOU GAY? NOT THAT I CARE. BUT WHEN YOU GET UP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AND USE PHRASES LIKE "WIDESPREAD DESPAIR" AND--AND "GOVERNMENT OF THE RICH" AND BASICALLY SOW DOUBTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF POWER IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU SOUND LIKE DR. KIM'S BUTT BUDDY! STOP. Dinah: YOU'RE FIRED, GARNE. WHAT, AGAIN? WELL, THIS TIME, FOR KEEPS. YOU SPOKE ABOUT THINGS THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT AND IN FRONT OF KINZEL, FOR GOD'S SAKE! NO, KINZEL'S YOUR SECURITY, DARLING. YOU AND BLAKE INSISTED, BUT I WARNED YOU, DIDN'T I? HIS RéSUMé IS CLASSIFIED. NSA COVERT OPS. HIS RECOMMENDATIONS WERE EXCELLENT. BLAKE INSISTS HE'S FIRST-RATE AND LOYAL. YEAH, BOUGHT AND PAID FOR, I'M SURE. HERE'S YOUR... YOUR SEVERANCE CHECK. OH, DI... I'LL MISS YOU. GOING...GOING... GARNE. THE RICH ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM YOU AND ME. LISTEN, I NEED TO BORROW YOUR CARD AND STOP AT A... CASH MACHINE BEFORE WE GO TO THIS THING WITH THE MOOREHEADS. IS SHE GOOD-LOOKING? CALL IT AN ATTACK OF MALE PRIDE. I JUST THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS FOR ME TO BE WALKING AROUND PENNILESS. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KEEP TELLING THE WORLD I'M RICHER THAN GOD. WELL, THEY ARE ENTITLED TO KNOW, YOU KNOW. WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO STOP TONIGHT. SO WHY DON'T YOU...AHEM! GET A BLANK CHECK OUT OF THE BIG BOOK IN THERE. YOU CAN FILL IN WHATEVER AMOUNT YOU WANT. I'LL SIGN IT NOW... WHILE YOU'RE GETTING MY NECKLACE. THE PEARLS? NO. THE DIAMONDS. "THE LOUIS QUATORZE..." WHAT WAS THAT? SIR? YEAH? SHIT. OH. FRIEND OF YOURS, SIR? HEH HEH! FRIEND OF A FRIEND. REALLY, BLAKE. THE MAID? IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. YOU'RE SUCH A BASTARD. WE HAVE TO TALK. REMEMBER ME, BLAKE? COME AND SEE US DOWN IN CAPE GIRARDEAU. [BAND PLAYS SAINTS GO MARCHING IN] OOH... OH... OH! OOH. DINAH, I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD COME. DINAH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DINAH, WHY DON'T YOU STAY AND TAKE SOME PICTURES WITH US? OH, HELLO, JACK. HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT? TONIGHT, SENATOR JACK MOOREHEAD AND HIS WIFE GIGI ARE GIVING EXTRA MEANING TO THE WORDS "POLITICAL PARTY." OVER THE LAST 4 DAYS, THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE SPONSORED A SERIES OF GRAND BALLS IN HOPES OF SEDUCING ONE OF THE INDEPENDENT FRONT-RUNNERS INTO JOINING THEIR PARTY. WELL, GIGI, HONEY, I AM A 100% CARBON COPY OF A SELF-MADE COMMON MAN. I--I AM WHAT TODAY'S SCIENTISTS WOULD CALL A... WHAT WAS THAT WORD, BUTTERCUP? OH, THAT WOULD BE "POSTLITERATE," HON. YEAH, POSTLITERATE. MEANS I CAN READ, BUT I DON'T. NO TIME, TOO MANY WORDS... B.C. HERE'S A BIG READER, THOUGH. WHAT WAS THAT GREAT BOOK YOU READ TO ME THE OTHER NIGHT? OH, THAT WOULD BE THACKERAY, LOVER. THACKERAY. THAT'S RIGHT, BLAKE. THIS HERE'S YOUR QUOTE OF THE DAY. [REPORTERS CALLING OUT] "MY KIND OF PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST PEOPLE." NOT THE BEST PEOPLE. "THEY'RE NOT THE KINDEST PEOPLE "OR THE SMARTEST PEOPLE. "THEY MAY NOT EVEN BE "THE MOST HONEST PEOPLE, BUT THEY ARE, "QUITE SIMPLY, THE PEOPLE ABOUT WHOM... Together: THERE IS NO QUESTION." NOW, BLAKE, THAT'S WHERE WE DIFFER. WHEN THE VOTING PUBLIC LOOKS AT ME, THEY SEE A MAN AS PLAIN AS A TREE STUMP. PLAINLY, THEY DON'T KNOW YOU. WELL, THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW. SEE, GOD MADE ME A MAN ABOUT WHOM THERE IS NO QUESTION. DADDY, WILL YOU COME DANCE WITH ME? GENTLEMEN... LADIES... [PLAYING FOX-TROT] WHOA! SORRY. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY DARLING WIFE, HAVE YOU? IS IT MY IMAGINATION, OR DID THAT MAN ACTUALLY BRAG THAT HE CAN'T READ? IS JACK REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT ENDORSING HIM? OF COURSE HE IS, SUGAR. I MEAN, YOU HEARD HOMER. THERE ARE TOO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU, BLAKE. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ME, DO YOU? I WISH. Man: MR. PELLARIN, A PICTURE? YOU STARTED SMOKING AGAIN? NO. BUT IT'S BEEN THAT KIND OF DAY. "THE LOUIS QUATORZE." WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? WHAT IS THE LOUIS QUATORZE? IS THAT A HOTEL? IT'S AN OLD RIVER SHOWBOAT. FOR GAY MEN. [LAUGHS] AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO YOU, I'M GOING TO CONFISCATE THIS AND DESTROY IT. BE MY GUEST. "ASK FOR LITTLE JOHN-JOHN"? NO PHONE NUMBER. DISAPPOINTED? WHO IS RAYMOND ROMERO? WHAT IS THE GLORY IN STALKING AN INTERVIEW SUBJECT THE WAY YOU JUST STALKED ME? I'M NOT INTERESTED IN GLORY. TRUTH... IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN GLORY IN THE END. IT'S BETTER COMPANY. STEADIER. PERHAPS. BUT THE TRUTH IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SIMPLY GRAB WHILE RIDING THE MEDIA MERRY-GO-ROUND, MISS BRANDINI. HMM? [CHUCKLES] THANK YOU. [FLUSHES] YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL SMILE, YOU KNOW. WHO IS RAYMOND ROMERO? WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOUR SOURCE... KIMBALL MENNAKER? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK MY QUESTION COMES FROM MENNAKER? OK... WE DID A LOT OF TALKING. AND I'LL BET HE DID MOST OF IT. MENNAKER HAS LEFT HAVANA, YOU KNOW. HE'S HERE, IN ST. LOUIS. ABOARD A BIG RIVERBOAT CALLED THE LOUIS QUATORZE? YOU DONT CALL YOURSELF LITTLE JOHN-JOHN IN YOUR OFF HOURS, DO YOU? [BAND PLAYING SWING] CHIGGER, CHIGGER... GO SEE WHAT THAT CANDY-ASS IS UP TO. Blake: WHEN DID YOU START SMOKING CIGARS? TONIGHT. WISH YOU WOULDN'T HIDE OUT LIKE THIS. YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MUCH I MISSED YOU DOWN THERE. SO WHAT DID WE DISCUSS? KIM. HIS CAREER AS A PORNOGRAPHER WAS BRIEF, BUT HE HAD A UNIQUE STYLE. YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS YOU? I'M SAYING... IT'S BILLY.... MY BROTHER. 30 YEARS AGO. IT SURE AS HELL LOOKS LIKE YOU. LOOK CLOSER... AND NOT AT THE FACE. [CLEARS THROAT] WELL... IT HAS BEEN A WHILE. I WAS NEVER PART OF THAT SCENE. KIM KEPT ME AWAY FROM IT. HE HAD A BIGGER STAKE IN MY FUTURE. IT LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU, BLAKE. HE USED BILLY BECAUSE HE LOOKED LIKE ME. OH, JESUS. RAYMOND ROMERO. THE BRANDINI WOMAN HAS THE NAME, BUT SHE HASN'T A CLUE WHAT TO DO WITH IT. HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE REMEMBER RAYMOND ROMERO? A FEW SCHOOLMATES. WHO REMEMBERS BILLY? I DON'T KNOW. BILLY SPENT HIS LIFE CRAZY OR HIGH OR AS A RUNAWAY. BEFORE HE WENT TO VIETNAM, KIM MADE SURE ANY CONNECTION WAS BURIED BETWEEN US. YOU KNOW, BILLY ALWAYS EMBARRASSED THE HELL OUT OF ME. WELL, BRACE YOURSELF. HE'S ABOUT TO EMBARRASS YOU FROM THE GRAVE. IF HE EVEN HAS A GRAVE. BILLY WAS MISSING IN ACTION. NOW YOU'RE SAYING HE'S ALIVE? NO. CHRIST, NO. I'M JUST, UH, FEELING GHOSTS. REST IN PEACE, BILLY. [TRAIN ARRIVALS BEING ANNOUNCED] DID HE GO TO COLLEGE ALREADY? NO, BILLY, NOT TILL FALL. HE SAID HE WAS GONNA SAY GOOD-BYE. WHEREVER HE IS, HE'S FEELING TERRIBLY GUILTY. HE THINKS HE'S BEING A COWARD. WELL, HE THINKS RIGHT. NO, BOTH MY BOYS ARE BRAVE BOYS. AND YOU'RE A GENIUS OF BRAVERY, BILLY, BUT YOUR BROTHER'S COURAGE IS OF A...PLAINER SORT. HIS KIND OF BRAVERY TAKES TIME TO GROW. YOU'RE GIVING HIM THAT TIME. DON'T MISS YOUR TRAIN. YOU BETTER TALK TO BRANDINI. WE HAVE TO RISK IT. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. I KNOW. WHY IS THAT? Kim: TO BE A GREAT MAN, EVEN PRESIDENT, IS TO HAVE A DEVIL OF DOUBT DEEP WITHIN YOU, NOT SELF-DOUBT, BUT COSMIC DOUBT. SHALL I BE A MONK? SHOULD I JUST... FUCK EVERYBODY? OR SHOULD I ACCEPT DESTINY, AIM HIGH, DREAM OF THE WHITE HOUSE, AND SPEND EVERY WAKING MOMENT TRYING TO GRAB THAT BIG BRASS RING? YOUR PERSISTENCE MOVES ME, BRANDINI. I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RESIST A PRETTY PAIR OF EYES UPRAISED AT ME IN SUCH ADORATION. FUCK OFF. IS THIS FROM YOU? NO. I ASSURE YOU, NO. IT'S EMPTY. WHAT DOES THE NAME RAYMOND ROMERO MEAN TO YOU, REALLY? I'M NOT SURE, BUT I SUSPECT IT'S THE WHOLE STORY. THERE'S NEVER A WHOLE STORY. OF COURSE THERE IS. THERE HAS TO BE. OH, I REMEMBER NOW. IT'S COMING BACK TO ME. WHEN I WAS A KID, THERE WAS A SLED, AND ON THE SLED WAS THE NAME "RAYMOND ROMERO." ACTUALLY, I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. YOU'VE FOUND THE WHOLE KEY TO ME. I'M BEING SERIOUS. DEADLY SERIOUS? HE WAS MY BROTHER. WHO? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? HE WAS MY BROTHER. OUR FATHER'S NAME WAS WILLIAM BLAKE PELLARIN. OUR MOTHER'S NAME WAS CARINA ROMERO. WE WERE BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK... ABOUT A YEAR APART. YOU FOLLOW? RAYMOND ROMERO, YOUR BROTHER? WHAT'S IN A NAME? MAY I TALK TO HIM? HE'S DEAD. I'M SORRY. HOW DID HE DIE? LOOK, I HARDLY KNEW HIM. WHEN WE WERE LITTLE, I LOVED HIM. LATER, I HATED HIM. HIS ENTIRE EXISTENCE WAS A REPROACH TO ME. HE'S...DEAD. I'M ALIVE. THAT'S IT. SO WHY IS IT USEFUL TO TELL ME NOW? I HAVE NEVER WANTED TO EXPLOIT MY BROTHER, MS. BRANDINI. I HAVE NEVER-- I WAS TOO STUPID TO LOVE HIM WHEN HE WAS ALIVE. WHAT KIND OF HYPOCRITE WOULD I BE TO USE HIM NOW? HOW DID HE DIE? MRS. PELLARIN ASKED ME TO INFORM YOU SHE RETURNED TO THE YACHT, SIR. IT'S A BOAT, KINZEL. THAT'S THE STORY. YOU SURE YOU GOT IT COVERED? YUP. HEY, JERRY, CHEER UP. WE'RE GONNA BE BODYGUARDS TO A GOVERNOR. YOU, MAYBE. YEAH, COME ON, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE YOU HEAD OF THE WHOLE DETAIL. DON'T KNOW IF I WANT IT. OK. WELL, UH, CATCH YOU TOMORROW. SAY, BUCKLE. YEAH? YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RELATIVITY? YEAH, SURE. THAT'S-- THAT'S, UH, EINSTEIN. PRETTY ELEGANT, DON'T YOU THINK? SORT OF LIKE, "OBJECTS IN THE MIRROR MAY BE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR," ONLY ON A COSMIC SCALE, KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [LAUGHS] YOU'RE A TRIP, KINZEL. MAYBE IT'S EVEN SIMPLER THAN THAT. YOU ASLEEP, PUMPKIN? [OUTBOARD ENGINE STARTS] WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND. [SPEAKING FRENCH] YEAH, OPERATOR, COULD YOU LOOK UP THE NUMBER AND PUT ME THROUGH TO THE LOUIS QUATORZE. YES, I'LL PAY THE ADDITIONAL 50 CENTS. YES, COULD YOU-- YES, I'LL HOLD. RAYMOND ROMERO... "RAYMOND ROMERO." "WILLIAM BLAKE PELLARIN... BILLY... BEAUTIFUL DREAMER." "RAYMOND ROMERO... CALL ME RAY...ZAP!" HMM... WOW. Kim: "GOING UP THAT RIVER "WAS LIKE TRAVELING BACK "TO THE EARLIEST BEGINNINGS OF THE WORLD, "WHEN VEGETATION RIOTED ON THE EARTH "AND THE BIG TREES WERE KINGS. "OH, THERE WERE TIMES WHEN ONE'S PAST CAME BACK TO ONE, "BUT IT CAME IN THE SHAPE "OF AN UNRESTFUL AND NOISY DREAM. "SO I TOOK MY PADDLE "AND SLID OUD FROM THE SHORE JUST A STEP OR TWO "AND LET THE CANOE DROP ALONG DOWN AMONG THE SHADOWS. THE MOON WAS SHINING." THAT'S NOT JOSEPH CONRAD, SIR. ANYONE WHO PRETENDED TO KNOW THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, ANYONE WHO WAS OFF TO YALE WOULD KNOW AT ONCE THAT THIS IS CONRAD. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PASSAGES HE EVER WROTE! THE FIRST PART WAS. WHAT YOU'RE READING FROM NOW IS... HUCKLEBERRY FINN. WHERE ON EARTH DID YOU GET THAT IDEA?! WHAT UNDILUTED ARROGANCE! WHAT SHEER... GENIUS. [LAUGHS] YES, IT WAS MARK TWAIN. I, UH, SNEAKED IT IN AFTER THE CONRAD, AND YOU'RE THE FIRST UPSTART EVER TO CALL ME ON IT. YOU'VE GOT QUITE A BRAIN FOR LITERATURE. YOUR POOR PARENTS SQUANDERED THE NAME WILLIAM BLAKE ON THE WRONG SON. WHAT'S IN A NAME? [LAUGHTER] SAILOR, CUT YOUR MOTOR!

I'M AFRAID I CAN CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR THAT. SHE'S NOT AT ALL WELL. AND ARE YOU? I'VE BEEN YOUNGER. ARE THOSE ACTUAL WOMEN? OH, WHAT A POIGNANT QUESTION. THESE ARE, INDEED, ACTUAL WOMEN. STAND, MY DEARS, AND MODEL FOR OUR GUEST. [HUMMING] AFRAID OF HIDDEN CAMERAS, ARE WE? I'M NOT AFRAID. THAT'S BRAVE OF YOU. EVEN SO, COULD I ASK YOU AS A FAVOR TO GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF HERE? OHH. Little John-John: COME ON, LADIES, BACK TO YOUR PERCH. TSK TSK TSK TSK TSK TSK. YOU LUGGED ALL THESE PAGES WITH YOU, ALL THE WAY TO CUBA AND BACK? WELL, I NEVER GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT MY BOOK, MY BIG BOOK. "A SYMPATHETIC PHENOMENA"? NOT THAT I HAVE A CLUE WHAT THAT MEANS. WELL, NOBODY DOES. THAT'S WHY I'M WRITING IT. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WRITING THIS OPUS? 27 YEARS. YOU HAVE INCREDIBLE WILLPOWER, KIM. I WAS HOPING TO UNIFY THE FIELDS OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS, BUT ALL I'VE PROVED IS THE EXISTENCE OF HOTEL STATIONERY. HOW MANY PAGES ARE WE AT NOW? OH, UH, 15,000 ROUGH, 7,000 POLISHED. OH, REALLY. AFTER 27 YEARS, I SHOULD LOSE COUNT. WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL FINISH? MONDAY AT THE LATEST. BELIEVE IT OR NOT... I'VE OFTEN MISSED YOU, KIM. BUT THAT'S NOT WHY YOU'VE COME. MERCIFUL HEAVENS. THEY'RE FOR YOU. HOW DISAPPOINTING. I WAS HOPING THEY WERE FOR YOU. THE WORLD COULD USE A LEADER WITH A RECKLESS TASTE IN UNDERGARMENTS. GIVE ME EVERY NEGATIVE AND PRINT OF THAT BILLY PHOTO AND ANY OTHERS LIKE IT. THAT'S NOT THE PHOTO I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S ALL I HAVE. ALL LOST. MULCH AND ASHES NOW. WHAT YOU SAW IS ALL I HAVE LEFT. THEN WHY SEND IT TO ME? TO REMIND YOU OF WHO YOU ARE... AND WHO YOU NEVER WERE. BILLY... AH, HE WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL BOY. WHEN I THINK OF WHAT WE DID TO HIM-- WHAT WE DID TO BILLY, BILLY VERY CHEERFULLY CONSENTED TO DO WITH US. WE STOLE HIS NAME! YOU HAD AS MUCH RIGHT TO THE NAME BLAKE PELLARIN AS HE DID. HE WASN'T USING IT. YOU JUST LOVE WILLIAM BLAKE PELLARIN BECAUSE IT WAS MY FATHER'S NAME. WELL, IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT YOUR POOR MOTHER STUCK YOU WITH! DO YOU THINK FOR ONE MINUTE THAT AMERICANS WOULD VOTE FOR A PRESIDENT NAMED ROMERO? NOT A TSONGAS, NOT A DUKAKIS, NOT A CUOMO, NOT A ROMERO. NOT IN THIS CENTURY. THE CENTURY'S OVER. TIMES CHANGE. WELL, WHAT DID WE KNOW THEN? ENOUGH FOR ME TO SAY NO! I ONLY WISH HE WERE ALIVE. I BULLIED YOU INTO MAKING THE SWITCH. SO BLAME ME. I WAS TERRIFIED OF LOSING YOU THE WAY I'D LOST YOUR POOR FATHER. WE THREW BILLY'S LIFE AWAY. OH, BILLY HAD NO LIFE. HIS FUTURE WAS ALL USED UP, AND HE KNEW IT. AND SO DID YOU. WHAT'S IN A NAME? RAYMOND ROMERO BY ANY OTHER NAME IS TWICE AS PRESIDENTIAL. THAT'S ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS. GO AWAY! WHAT IS IT YOU WANT? [CHIRPING] OH! WHEW... GOD! HA HA... OHH... OHH! OH, DEAR. ANYTHING BUT A MONKEY WITH WIND. OH, DEAR... WHEN YOU BECOME PRESIDENT, I WILL BE YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE. AND NO, I'M NOT SENILE. YOU'RE INSANE, KIM. LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED NO DOUBT THAT YOU'LL BE PRESIDENT. I KNOW THEE NOT, OLD MAN. YOU AT LEAST OWE BILLY THAT MUCH. WHAT, I OWE BILLY TO BE PRESIDENT TO MAKE YOU SECRETARY OF STATE?! NO, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU OWE BILLY TO BE WISE AND JUST. IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SEE BILLY AGAIN, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? I WON'T BE PARTY TO YOUR SEANCE, KIM. EARLIER TODAY, YOU STARED INTO THAT STRANGER'S EYES AND LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE ABOUT TO SHIT YOUR OWN GRAVESTONE. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT? PENDING YOUR FINAL ANSWER, THE NEXT PHOTO GOES TO HOMER DIX. MY FINAL ANSWER IS NO. IF YOU'RE GONNA WALK AROUND WITH THAT MUCH LOOT AROUND YOUR NECK, AT LEAST WEAR A LITTLE CAMOUFLAGE. [CHIRPS] SHE'S PEEING, KIM. YOU SEE, MIMI IS BILLY'S LITTLE PET. A PEACE OFFERING FROM BROTHER TO BROTHER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? BILLY'S ALIVE. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S MORE THAN IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S A MIRACLE. HE SWAM OR... FLOATED DOWNRIVER, MADE HIS WAY OUT OF THAT... QUAGMIRE THROUGH GOD KNOWS WHAT KIND OF HELL... AND TURNED UP IN CUBA... OF ALL PLACES... 15 YEARS AGO. BADLY DISABLED... BUT HIMSELF. I'VE BEEN LOOKING AFTER HIM. MEET WITH HIM. YOU'RE LYING. NO. I'M MUCH TOO OLD TO LIE. SUNDAY? SHALL WE SAY MIDNIGHT? PERFECT. [CHEERING AND SHOUTING] BILLY? GOVERNOR PELLARIN? MR. PRESIDENT? OOH, WHO ARE YOU NOW? WHERE ARE YOU FROM? SHE'S NOT WELL. IS SHE YOURS? AN INHERITANCE. YOU FOLLOWED ME. I'M DELIVERING A BOOK. I'M SERIOUS. YOU'RE ALWAYS SERIOUS, BRANDINI. IT'S YOUR ONE UGLY TRAIT. YOUR BROTHER WAS REPORTED KILLED IN ACTION, DROWNED WITH MOST OF HIS PLATOON WHILE DEFENDING A BRIDGE ACROSS THE ME KHONG, SEPTEMBER 11, 1972. IT TOOK ONE PHONE CALL. HIS DEATH IS NOT A SECRET. BUT "KILLED" IS A WEAK WORD. HE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE, LIKE OUR FATHER DID IN KOREA. [CHIRPS] HOW ABOUT A LIFT? WE'LL TALK... OFF THE RECORD THIS TIME. P.A.: ON TRACK 15... HEY. Conductor: ALL ABOARD! HEY. HI! HEY, YOURSELF, EAVESDROPPER. YOU JUST MISSED THE OLD MAN. SO I HEAR HE'S TAKING YOU TO YALE. DON'T GO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. DON'T LEAVE. WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING, WE GO IN THE MEN'S ROOM AND SWITCH CLOTHES? I'M SUGGESTING WE TURN OURSELVES IN. THE OLD MAN WON'T LIKE THAT. FUCK THE OLD MAN! I HAD NO IDEA UNTIL LAST WEEK THAT YOU AND DR. MENNAKER ARE SO CLOSE. WHAT YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT IS JUST ME, VACATIONING IN THE DARK HEART OF A NOSTALGIC IMPULSE. I LIKE THAT. DARK HEART. IT SUITS YOU. YOU STILL SUFFER OVER YOUR BROTHER KILLED IN VIETNAM, DON'T YOU? YOU DON'T JUST MOURN. YOU...SUFFER...DEEPLY. THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU SO ATTRACTIVE TO ME. POLITICALLY, I MEAN. 5 YEARS AGO, I HELD IN MY ARMS IN SARAJEVO... A DYING MAN. THE ONLY--THE ONLY MAN I EVER TRULY LOVED. I KNOW ABOUT SUFFERING, DARK HEART. YOU ARE SEEKING ABSOLUTION FOR SOME GREAT SIN. I ONLY WISH I KNEW WHAT IT WAS. THAT'S BETWEEN ME AND MY PRIEST. STAY AWAY FROM PRIESTS, DARK HEART. GO GET YOURSELF A GOOD PSYCHIATRIST. I CAN'T AFFORD A PSYCHIATRIST. POLITICALLY, I MEAN. ANYWAY, HONEY, SHRINKS DON'T BELIEVE IN SIN. THANKS FOR THE RIDE. TOP OF THE MORNIN' TO YOU, SIR. YOUR NECKLACE, SIR. KINZEL, TAKE THIS ANIMAL TO A VETERINARIAN AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SAFE. STOP STARING AND DO IT. AYE, AYE, SIR. I'M HERE AS A FRIEND. OK... HOW IS SHE? DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO ASK? FINE. LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO REPLACE KINZEL. LOOKS LIKE THE MAN IS DEVELOPING TOO MUCH OF AN OPINION. GO TO YOUR WIFE. I WANT YOU TO SEE A DOCTOR. DON'T BE AN ASS. GET UP. OH! OH! I'M SORRY THAT I STOLE YOUR DIAMONDS. MY DIAMONDS?! YOU TOOK MY DIAMONDS? YOU TOOK MY YOUTH, BLAKE. [CRYING] YOU TOOK MY YOUTH. WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND THAT COCKSUCKER?! AFTER 25 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, AFTER ALL THE FUCKING CONCUBINES AND THOSE WHORES, HE'S GONNA BE THE ONE TO RIDE ALL OVER US, JUST LIKE HE DID YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER. THERE'S MORE BAD NEWS. YOU BETTER BRACE YOURSELF. OH, WHAT IS IT? I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT'S MY FUCKING NAME, "BRACE YOURSELF." WELL, BRACE YOURSELF! YOU KNOW THAT MAN LIVES TO DESTROY YOU, BLAKE, AND HE ALWAYS HAS. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN FREE OF HIM? EVER, HMM? EVERY BAD THING, EVERY SHAMEFUL THING IN YOUR LIFE, HE'S BEEN THE ARCHITECT. YOU ARE NOT THE GUILTY ONE. NO. NO. NO. WE EITHER ARE... OR WE ARE NOT. FOR A WOMAN WITH AN UNTOLD PORTION OF VODKA IN HER, YOU ARE PRETTY DAMN LUCID. WINNING THIS ELECTION'S ALL I GOT. IT'S THE ONLY THING... THE ONLY THING I CAN FEEL. THE ONLY THING I CAN FEEL. YOU SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO YOUR FATHER ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. HE SAW THROUGH ME. HE SAW GREATNESS IN YOU. HE SAW CASH IN ME. THAT I'D BE A GOOD KING ON THE CHESSBOARD FOR HIS LITTLE QUEEN. HE WAS YOUR KIM. DON'T... DON'T COMPARE THEM. DADDY UNDERSTOOD LOVE AS MUCH AS ANY MAN. YOU KNOW, WHEN I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T THINK I COULD EVER COUNT ON YOU WANTING CHILDREN, YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? "YOU'LL BE OK, PUMPKIN. BLAKE LOVES YOU." "HE LOVES YOU." HE SAW THAT IN YOU. I DON'T THINK THAT REMORSE IS SOMETHING THAT, UH... THAT IS EXPRESSED IN FRONT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SPONTANEOUSLY. Kinzel: REPLACE KINZEL. HE LOOKS LIKE A MAN WHO'S DEVELOPING AN OPINION. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU SMOOTH BASTARD. BIG FRIEND OF THE WORKING MAN, THAT'S YOU. SHAKE THEIR HAND AND HAND 'EM A PINK SLIP. SLIP IT TO 'EM LIKE A GODDAMN KNIFE. YEAH, LET'S HEAR IT FOR REDEMPTION, BLAKE. LET SOMEONE ELSE GO OFF AND FIGHT YOUR GODDAMN WARS, THEN MAYBE THE CORPSE WILL SIT UP AND FORGIVE YOU. THAT THE IDEA? YOU WANT FORGIVENESS? I'LL GIVE YOU FORGIVENESS, NUMBNUTS. A HIDDEN BROTHER IS CASTING A PECULIAR SHADOW OVER THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. CORPORAL RAYMOND ROMERO, MISSING IN VIETNAM SINCE 1973, IS APPARENTLY BLAKE PELLARIN'S LONG-LOST BIOLOGICAL BROTHER. TODAY RIVAL CANDIDATE HOMER DIX IS ACCUSING PELLARIN OF TREATING THIS FORGOTTEN HERO LIKE A DIRTY SECRET. I'M GONNA HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE TONIGHT AT 6:00 AT WHICH TIME I WILL REVEAL TO THE VOTING PUBLIC SOME NEW LIGHT TO BE SHED ON THE CHARACTER OF BLAKE PELLARIN, A MAN SO FAR WHO HAS SHOWN LITTLE RESPECT FOR THAT UNKNOWN SOLDIER AND HIS GREAT SACRIFICE. REACTION FROM THE PELLARIN CAMP WAS SWIFT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM MR. DIX. I, TOO, WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. AND AS REGARDS MY BROTHER, I GAVE A LENGTHY INTERVIEW JUST RECENTLY TO CELA BRANDINI... Thad: THERE'S A NEWS FLASH. I WANTED TO TELL YOU, BUT YOU'D ALREADY LEFT FOR NEW YORK. YOU THINK DIX HAS CAUGHT HIM IN A LIE? NO. PELLARIN'S TOO CLEVER TO BE TRAPPED THAT WAY. HE ONLY TELLS PRECISELY THAT FRACTION OF THE TRUTH WHICH WILL ALLOW THE LISTENER'S IMAGINATION TO LIE FOR HIM. NO. THERE'S A MUCH DEEPER ANGLE HERE. A SEXY ANGLE? SEXY IN THE SENSE OF SEX, OR SEXY IN THE SENSE OF NEWS THAT SELLS? I'LL BITE AT EITHER END. PELLARIN'S ONCE COMMANDING LEAD HAS NOW DROPPED TO LESS THAN 5 POINTS. FUCK. WE'RE DEAD. I'M FUCKING DEAD. NOT JUST YET. DO YOU REMEMBER A COMPROMISING PHOTO OF HOMER DIX WITH HIS GOOD OL' BOYS? WE KEPT IT IN A BLACK FILE FOLDER LABELED "HOMER'S ODYSSEY." I KNOW, I KNOW. A THING OF CROOKED BEAUTY, BUT IT'S NOT HOMER. I FOUND THE REAL GUY DOWN ON THE BOOT HEEL. I TALKED TO HIM. LOOKS JUST LIKE HOMER. IS NOT HOMER. THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN. I WANT YOU TO DOCTOR IT. JUST A LITTLE. ALL THAT FANCY SOFTWARE WE BOUGHT YOU. YOU KNOW HOW HOMER HAS THESE ODD LITTLE SCARS ACROSS 3 FINGERS ON HIS HANDS? I'VE NEVER LOOKED AT HIS HANDS, BLAKE. NORMAL GUYS LOOK AT EACH OTHER'S CARS. ARE YOU ON THE BUS OR OFF THE BUS? "FURTHER" IS MY DESTINATION, BABY. I KNEW BOTH BROTHERS IN SCHOOL. RAY PUT HIMSELF UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE. HE HAD A HUGE RAGE TO SUCCEED. HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND. WE WERE ALWAYS IN A CONTEST TO SEE WHO COULD HEAD UP THE MOST AFTER-SCHOOL CLUBS. HEH HEH. BUT BILLY I HARDLY KNEW. NOBODY KNEW HIM. IT'S AMAZING HOW HE TURNED OUT CONSIDERING HE WAS ALWAYS IN TROUBLE. AND DON'T USE THAT IN YOUR PIECE. DON'T WORRY. THIS IS FOR BACKGROUND. BUT THE CANDIDATE HIMSELF IS VERY FRANK ABOUT HIS SO-CALLED TROUBLED PAST. RAY GREW TO HATE HIS GUTS. HOW SO? WELL, BILLY-- I COULD NEVER GET USED TO CALLING HIM BLAKE-- BILLY WAS A HUGE SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT TO RAY. YOU'D FIND HIM SLEEPING OUTDOORS... CURLED UP IN THE AUDITORIUM. HIS FEET WERE ALWAYS FILTHY. HE HARDLY EVER WORE SHOES. HE'D DISAPPEAR FOR MONTHS AT A TIME AND THEN SHOW UP OUT OF THE BLUE. AND? AND...SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T HAVE SEEN. TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW. RAY WAS A GREAT GUY. I WOULD HATE IF THIS WERE THE ONLY IMPRESSION THAT PEOPLE HAD OF HIM. TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW. IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A NIGHTMARE. I'VE SEEN FIGHTS. I'VE BEEN IN FIGHTS. BUT THIS IS THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER COME TO WITNESSING AN ATTEMPTED MURDER. BUT I CAN TELL YOU, BILLY DIDN'T DESERVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OK. THANK YOU. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU TALKED TO BLAKE? OH, GOD... YEARS AND YEARS. I THINK THE LAST TIME THAT I SPOKE TO RAY WAS WHEN HIS NUMBER CAME UP. NUMBER? DRAFT. VIETNAM WAR. ANCIENT HISTORY NOW. Cela: OH, THAT'S CUTE. IS THAT STANDARD PRACTICE IN AMERICA? Rusty: BACK IN THE FIFTIES IT WAS. RUSTY, HOW DID THE DRAFT LOTTERY WORK DURING THE VIETNAM WAR? WELL, THE NUMBERS WERE BASED ON BIRTHDAYS. SEE, THESE 2 GUYS WERE BORN IN THE FIFTIES. ROMERO, RAYMOND, BORN 31 OCTOBER, 1953. THEY PICKED THIS POOR BASTARD'S BIRTHDAY AT NUMBER 10. PRESTO--6 MONTHS LATER HE'S CARRYING AN M-16 WITH HIS ASS IN THE GRASS. BUT HE WAS STILL A STUDENT. NO STUDENT DEFERMENTS. THAT WAS NIXON'S REVENGE ON STUDENT PROTESTERS. NOW, PELLARIN, WILLIAM B... HIS NUMBER WAS 305. MADE IN THE SHADE. BUT IF IT HADN'T BEEN, WHAT COULD HE DO? SHORT OF WEARING LIPSTICK AND HIGH HEELS, HE COULD GO TO CANADA... HE COULD GO TO JAIL, OR HE COULD TRY TO CONVINCE THE DRAFT BOARD HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS A BASE AND SLANDEROUS LIE. WHAT DID YOU DO? MY NUMBER WAS 219. THE LUCKIEST NUMBER OF MY LIFE. WE'RE LATE, BUD. OH, CELA, I ALMOST FORGOT. THAD WANTS YOU TO AIR YOUR STORY TOMORROW. WHAT? APPARENTLY HE THINKS YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING. ZAP YOURSELF, RAY. Announcer: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PRESENTING THE AMERICAN DREAMER WHO MAY WELL BE YOUR NEXT GOVERNOR, WILLIAM BLAKE PELLARIN! [CROWD CHANTING] BLAKE! BLAKE! BLAKE! P.A.: THE UNION PACIFIC EXPRESS LEAVING NOW ON TRACK 9... Young Blake: YOU DON'T HAVE TO. Young Ray: THE OLD MAN WON'T LIKE THAT. FUCK THE OLD MAN! OK. IT'S BEEN TRIED. YOU TELLING ME YOU AND OLD MAN? YOU KNOW HOW HE IS. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE. DOESN'T MEAN I'M A HOMOSEXUAL. JUST MEANS I'M INTO EXPERIMENTING, THAT'S ALL. YOU WERE WRONG TO SAY YES TO THIS. I MADE A PROMISE. SEMPER FI. YOU KNOW, SEMPER FIDELIS. ALWAYS FAITHFUL. I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. CHRIST, YOU'RE IN THE ARMY, NOT THE GODDAMN MARINES. BUT EVEN SO, I PROMISED YOU-- I PROMISED YOU, AND I PROMISED THE OLD MAN. IT'S A CRAZY PROMISE. A CRAZY PROMISE IS A SACRED ONE. YOU'RE NUTS. I LOVE YOU. NO. I DON'T LOVE YOU. I HATE YOU. I FUCKING HATE YOU! DON'T DO THIS TO ME. DON'T DO THIS FOR ME. YOU DIE OVER THERE, IT'S YOUR OWN FUCKING PROBLEM. FUCK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR. THIS WAS INSIDE THE POCKET OF THE JACKET. BLANK CHECKS FROM MRS. PELLARIN. AWFULLY LARGE TEMPTATION TO PUT IN THE HAND OF A DRY CLEANER, SIR. THIS CAME FOR YOU AS WELL. DON'T FORGET YOU'RE ADDRESSING CATHOLIC CHARITIES. MRS. PELLARIN WILL MEET YOU THERE. Kim: LOUIS QUATORZE... MIDNIGHT...BE PROMPT. MOTHER MACHREE. I DON'T WANT YOUR SEVERANCE CHECK. NO, MA'AM. REGARDLESS, ONCE YOU'VE DROPPED ME AT THE DOCTOR, YOUR SERVICES ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED. BLAKE'S GOT A BIG, BAD SECRET, MA'AM. MAYBE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, MAYBE NOT. BUT OLD MAN MENNAKER-- IF "MAN" IS THE PROPER FRENCH FOR "COCKSUCKER"-- THAT OLD COCKSUCKER KNOWS WHAT BLAKE KNOWS, AND YOUR WHOLE WORLD'S GONNA FALL FLAT APART IF DOC MENNAKER TELLS WHAT HE KNOWS. YOU MUST KNOW THAT, MA'AM. AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW? LESS AND LESS THE OLDER I GET, MA'AM. BUT I'M A VETERAN OF EL SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA. EVEN WON A PURPLE HEART STEPPING ON A BOOBY TRAP, THOUGH ALL THAT'S CLASSIFIED. I'M SORRY. I'M LUCKY. MY BUDDY WITH ME-- MY BUDDY HAD HIS LEG BLOWN OFF TO THE WAIST. BLED TO DEATH IN MINUTES. THAT'S CLASSIFIED, TOO, BUT IT HAPPENED. YES, MA'AM, IT HAPPENED. SEMPER FI, DO OR DIE. SEMPER FI, DO OR DIE. YOU KNOW, BLAKE AND I HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD TO YOU. UP TO A POINT AND IN YOUR OWN WAY, THAT'S TRUE, MA'AM. BUT I BELIEVED IN YOUR HUSBAND. I DON'T NOW. FROM WHERE I STAND, HE'S THE CROWN PRINCE OF BULLSHIT. MONEY TALKS, BULLSHIT WALKS. I HAVE SOME FIGURES HERE. FIGURE ONE IS THE BASE RATE FOR MAKING A FAGGOT GO AWAY. YOU'RE--YOU'RE NOT GONNA HARM KIM MENNAKER. FIGURE 2 IS FOR WHEN I TIE UP ALL THE LOOSE ENDS AND MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T BOOMERANG ON BLAKE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR LOGIC. EXPEDITE MENNAKER'S DEMISE, AND I STAPLE-GUN MY INFLUENCE TO YOUR HUSBAND, WHOM I'M SURE WILL BUY HIS WAY INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AT SOME POINT. LISTEN, KINZEL... WHAT WILL IT COST TO MAKE YOU DISAPPEAR RIGHT NOW? THAT'S NOT AN OPTION, MA'AM. [KNOCKING] YES! HELLO, KIM. I'M HERE AS A FRIEND. HEY, Y'ALL NEED TO BE ANNOUNCED. MR. DIX! YOU BARGE IN HERE WHILE I'M TAKING MY EXERCISE? YOU'RE ON THE 9 A.M. NEWS SAYING IT'S ALL OVER. SOUNDS LIKE A BAIT TO ME. HEH. WELL, YOU MIGHT AS WELL CONCEDE, SON. THE FABLED FAT LADY IS GETTING READY TO SING. WE'VE GOT THE GOODS ON YOU. YEAH. WELL, WELL, WELL. NOW, WOULD THESE BE THE TRUE GOODS OR THE FALSE GOODS? HEH. WHAT WOULD, UH, WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE THE FALSE GOODS IN THIS SITUATION? UH-UH-UH. THAT WOULDN'T BE CRICKET. FOOTBALL, BLAKE. FOOTBALL. THAT'D BE OUT OF BOUNDS, HOMER. WHAT IN THE HELL'S HE, YOUR DAMN SPORTS CONSULTANT? GOD DAMN IT. CHIGGER, GRAB THE DAMN SCOOP AND RESCUE THAT THING. IT ISN'T ME, HOMER. THE PICTURE IN THERE, IT ISN'T ME. WELL, IT SURE AS HELL LOOKS LIKE YOU. SOMETIME TODAY, YOU KNOW, BEFORE CHRISTMAS. I'VE SEEN IT ALREADY. WHEN DID THAT GET HERE? WAS THAT BROUGHT HERE BY A PRETTY CREOLE MAID? WHAT KINDA GAME YOU PLAYIN' WITH ME? WHAT GAME ARE YOU PLAYING? SAME AS YOU. A GAME OF WORDS. YES, BUT I'VE FINISHED MY BOOK, SENATOR. WHY DON'T YOU FINISH YOURS? BECAUSE THE TRUTH I AM SEEKING WOULD DEFEAT THE COMPLETION OF ANY BOOK. PERHAPS WHAT YOU'RE SEEKING IS A TOTAL EXCUSE FOR HOW YOU THREW YOUR LIFE AWAY. OHO. CONDEMNED BY MY OWN BIOGRAPHER. I HAVE LED A FULL LIFE. YOU SWITCHED THEIR BIRTH RECORDS, DIDN'T YOU? SEDUCING THE WEAKER BROTHER... TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF FOR THE STRONGER. WHO'S TO SAY WHICH WAS THE STRONGER BROTHER? HE'S STILL ALIVE, ISN'T HE? DEFINE "ALIVE." DOES BLAKE KNOW? WHEN YOU GET A BIT OLDER, MY DEAR, YOU'LL KNOW THAT LIVING PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE FUN TO READ THAN BOOKS, AND MORE STIMULATING TO PLAY THAN TIDDLYWINKS. WHAT'S THIS? IT'S NOT YOU. IF I WAS YOU, I WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT. I WOULD JUST CHUCK THAT THING INTO THE POOL. OH, GOD DAMN IT, THAT IS NOT ME! HOMER, THAT IS NOT YOU. I AM SERIOUS. THAT IS NOT ME. GOD DAMN, IT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE HIM. I KNOW THAT IS NOT YOU. I WILL TESTIFY IN COURT THAT IS NOT YOU. YOUR HONOR, THAT IS NOT THIS MAN. THOSE KKK TATTOOS ON HIS FINGERS I HAVE ON GOOD AUTHORITY FROM MY SPORTS CONSULTANT, THEY ARE NOT EVEN REAL. THEY ARE COOKED UP ON SOME SCOUNDREL'S COMPUTER, ALL TO TAKE THE MEANEST POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR MYSTERIOUS AFFLICTION. WHAT PRECISELY IS YOUR POINT? ONLY THAT IN THE GREAT SUPER BOWL BETWEEN PERCEPTION AND REALITY, PERCEPTION HAS JUST MARCHED THE BALL 60 YARDS DOWNFIELD INTO REALITY'S END ZONE. THAT'S THE GOAL, RIGHT? YES, BLAKE. THE END ZONE IS THE GOAL. SEE, I COULD SWEAR UP AND DOWN THAT THIS PICTURE IS A FAKE, BUT THE QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR PAST WILL BECOME AS REAL AS THESE LITTLE SCARS. YOU WILL SUDDENLY BECOME A MAN ABOUT WHOM THERE IS SOME QUESTION. COULD YOU... BORROW A GODDAMN SWIMSUIT? WHEN PEOPLE SEE WHAT'S IN THAT ENVELOPE, THEY'RE GONNA THINK THEY'VE SEEN YOU BUMPING DICK HEADS WITH A N-- GENTLEMAN OF THE AFRICAN PERSUASION. HA HA HA. IT ISN'T ME, HOMER. YOU PUSH ME TO IT TONIGHT, I'LL PROVE IT ISN'T ME IF I HAVE TO TAKE A PISS IN PUBLIC TO DO IT. IF FOLKS WANT TO THINK I'M A FAGGOT, LET 'EM. AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T COST ME ANY VOTES, I DON'T CARE. YEAH, WELL, PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS CHOOSE A BIGOT OVER A FAGGOT. STUDY YOUR HISTORY. PEOPLE WILL VOTE FOR THE PERSON WHO IS LEAST AFRAID. I'M NOT AFRAID OF WHAT'S IN THAT PHOTO, HOMER. AS A PRACTICAL MAN, PLAIN AS A TREE STUMP, THAT SHOULD CONCERN YOU. DO YOU PLAN TO DESTROY BLAKE? YES... IF I MUST... IF HE'LL NOT BE UNDERSTOOD ANY OTHER WAY. IF YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING NICE TO SAY ABOUT BLAKE, DO PLEASE GET IN TOUCH. "STRATFORD MOTOR HOTEL." WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LOUIS QUATORZE? OH, NO, NO. FORGET THE STRATFORD. THAT'S JUST WHERE I BUY MY CIGARS. NO. YOU'LL FIND MY HOME NUMBER INSIDE. HOW IS IT YOU MOST WISH TO BE REGARDED IN POSTERITY, SENATOR? IT'S WHAT WE DO HERE AND NOW THAT MATTERS. YOU DON'T THINK POSTERITY IS JUDGMENT, DO YOU? POSTERITY IS A WHIM... A SHAPELESS LITTER OF OLD BONES... THE MIDDEN OF A VULGAR BEAST... THE MOST CAPRICIOUS AND IMMENSE MASS PUBLIC OF THEM ALL-- THE DEAD. ADIOS, BRANDINI. [THINKING] SO THIS IS HOW MY DEATH BEGINS-- AS A RUMOR. SOME TRUE BELIEVER WISHES ME DEAD. WHAT NEXT... POSTERITY? BUT I'VE SPIT ON POSTERITY FOR NEARLY HALF MY LIFE. AND WHY? BECAUSE I REGARD MYSELF AS A FAILURE, AND I DON'T WANT TO STUDY WHAT THAT IS. COUNT ON ME TO BE THERE FOR YOU. COUNT ON IT! [APPLAUSE] Newscaster: THE LAST FEW DAYS IN MISSOURI'S INDEPENDENT GOVERNOR'S RACE HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THAN USUAL. POLLSTERS WHO GIVE THEMSELVES A 5-POINT MARGIN FOR ERROR NOW SAY THE RACE IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL. SORRY I'M LATE. I WAS DODGING REPORTERS. SO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT HERE? GOT SOME MORE BAGGAGE FOR US, BLAKE? IT'S $2 MILLION. ENOUGH TO MAKE KIM GO AWAY. DISAPPEAR. YEAH. WELL, HE NEEDS TO DISAPPEAR VERY FAST. WE ARE UP TO OUR EYEBALLS IN SUCH SHIT, BLAKE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. 2 MORE DAYS. AND THEN WHAT? AND WHAT FOR? REALLY. WHAT FOR? WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED, NATURALLY. THE BIG BRASS RING. DO I DISTURB? THIS IS A PRIVATE CLUB. I FORGOT TO TELL YOU, PUMPKIN-- SHE WANTED AN INTERVIEW. CAN YOU IMAGINE? I TALKED TO YOUR OLD SCHOOL FRIEND-- MAXIE--PACXY. YOU TALKED TO PACXY. PACXY BARRAGAN. IT'S BEEN YEARS. HE SAYS HE SAW ONE BROTHER BEAT THE OTHER NEARLY TO DEATH VERY EARLY ONE MORNING. WELL, I MEAN, UH... I MEAN, I REMEMBER THE INCIDENT. I'M JUST AMAZED THAT ANYBODY SAW IT. WHICH BROTHER BEAT WHICH? RAY BEAT BILLY. SUGAR? NOW... I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOU BEATING YOUR BROTHER. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHAT IS THE WORST THING THAT YOU'VE EVER DONE? THE WORST...THING. THE DIRTIEST THING. THAT PART OF YOU, WHICH IF YOU REVEALED IT, WOULD ALTER EVERY OPINION EVERYONE EVER HAD ABOUT YOU. IT MIGHT NOT GET YOU ARRESTED, BUT IT WOULD COST YOU MOST OF YOUR FRIENDSHIPS AND MAYBE EVEN YOUR JOB. I HAVE NO SUCH THING IN MY PAST. YOU CAN'T BE THAT DULL. I WAS VERY MEAN TO A SWEET LOVER ONCE. DON'T. DON'T TELL ME. KEEP IT. IT'S YOURS. IT BELONGS TO YOU, WHATEVER IT IS. AMONG THE FEW THINGS THAT REALLY BELONG TO A PERSON, THAT IS ONE. YOU DON'T... HAVE ANYONE, DO YOU? YOU'RE NOT MARRIED. ENGAGED? NO TIME, AND YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE. BUT I DOUBT I WILL EVER HAVE TO WORRY. YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF A MISOGYNIST. I DON'T HATE MY WIFE. I DON'T HATE WOMEN. I'VE DONE HATEFUL THINGS... ESPECIALLY TO MY WIFE AND TO MY BROTHER. BUT-- WHAT I HATE, I SUPPOSE, IS...LOVE. I'M ALL FOR LOVE. I'M ALL FOR PEOPLE BEING IN LOVE, BUT... IT'S NOT IN ME TO RECEIVE IT, I DON'T THINK. I MAKE A FAIR SHOW OF GIVING IT WHEN NECESSARY. RECEIVING IT IS TOO OVERWHELMING. IT'S TOO PAINFUL. EVERYONE NEEDS LOVE. I HATE LOVE BECAUSE I NEED IT. I'LL BET YOU AND I ARE ALIKE IN THAT WAY. I'M SURE YOU LOVED THAT MAN THAT YOU LOST. BUT IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO LOVE THE DEAD, ISN'T IT? YOU DON'T HAVE TO ENDURE THE BURDEN OF THEM LOVING YOU BACK. HOW YOU DOIN', SUGAR? YOU DON'T-- I'LL WATCH YOUR SUITCASE. SHE WANTS YOU TO FOLLOW HER. I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, BLAKE. I WON'T. THE LADY ASKED YOU TO MEET HER AT THIS ADDRESS, MR. PELLARIN. Cela: NO LUCK? IT'S DARK. YES, IT IS. Blake: "TO DRINK ITS STRAINS, "I'VE STOLE AWAY, ALL SILENTLY AND STILL." Cela: MMM. IS THIS SHAKESPEARE? NO, IT'S AMERICAN. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. [INCREDULOUS] NO. YES. IT SAID HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AN INSANE NEIGHBOR FROM HIS BOYHOOD, BUT... THE TRUTH IS HE WAS WRITING ABOUT HIMSELF. "I'VE HEARD IT OFT, "AS IF I DREAMED, "FAR DISTANT, SWEET, AND LONE; "THE FUNERAL DIRGE IT EVER SEEMED OF... "REASON, DEAD AND GONE. "AIR HELD HIS BREATH. "THE TREES ALL STILL SEEMED SORROWING ANGELS ROUND." "THEIR SWELLING TEARS IN DEWDROPS FELL..." "UPON GLISTENING GROUND." DON'T DO THIS TO ME. HOW MUCH IS IN THE SUITCASE? A LOT. WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY HOPE TO PURCHASE? FORGIVENESS. TELL THE WORLD THE TRUTH. TO WHAT END? BESIDES, YOU THINK ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED DOGCATCHER IF PEOPLE KNEW HOW CLOSE TO MADNESS HE LIVED? PEOPLE NEED THE TRUTH. THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO IT, EVEN IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND YOU. I CAN HELP YOU TELL IT. GROW UP. IT WILL BE SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU IF I REVEAL THE TRUTH WITHOUT YOUR HELP. YOU TAKE ME PUBLIC... I TAKE YOU PUBLIC. CLEAR? IS THAT WHY YOU MADE LOVE TO ME? NOT THE ONLY REASON. CAREFUL. I JUST WAXED.

OF THE TWO OF US, WHICH OF US RESEMBLED MY FATHER MORE, BILLY OR ME? WELL, YOU WERE THE MORE LIKE HIM. IT WAS A LIKENESS THAT ALWAYS CAME BETWEEN YOU AND ME. BUT... THERE WAS MORE TO YOUR FATHER, TOO. HIS SWEETNESS, HIS... RECKLESSNESS... HIS HEROIC NATURE... ALL WENT TO BILLY. Kim: DON'T FRET, BOYO. LEADERS CAN'T AFFORD TO BE SWEET. A GOOD LEADER IS NEVER RECKLESS. WHAT YOU HAD WAS A FIRE. I SAW IT IN YOU FROM THE START. BILLY DIDN'T HAVE IT, I DIDN'T HAVE IT, BUT YOU DID. YOU STILL DO. HE'S WAITING FOR YOU. COME ON. LET ME REINTRODUCE YOU. NO. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HAVE I SO RUINED YOUR LIFE? I CAN'T REIMAGINE IT WITHOUT YOU. WHAT WOULD MY LIFE HAVE BEEN LIKE WITHOUT YOU, AND BILLY'S? I WONDER.

AFTER ALL THE COWARDLY SHIT YOU'VE PULLED, I FIGURE THE BETTER PUNISHMENT IS YOU GET TO LIVE WITH IT. UHH... GROWN A PAIR OF BALLS, BLAKE? OK, HAVE IT YOUR WAY. BILLY, FORGIVE ME. SEMPER FI, BRO. SEMPER FI. HI, BROTHER. Billy: DREAM. DREAM OF MY FATHER. THE LAST 2 DAYS OF MISSOURI'S INDEPENDENT GOVERNOR'S RACE HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THAN USUAL... EARLY TRACKING MADE IT DIFFICULT TO TELL, BUT AS THE POLLS HAVE NOW CLOSED, IT'S CLEAR THAT... PELLARIN WAS AND IS THE PROJECTED WINNER OF THIS HISTORIC CONTEST BY AN IMPRESSIVE MARGIN OF 7% OVER HIS RIVAL... IN A RELATED STORY, AMERICA HAS LOST ONE OF ITS MOST FLAMBOYANT STATESMEN-- FORMER SENATOR KIMBALL MENNAKER... WHO VISITED THE ST. LOUIS AREA LAST WEEKEND PASSED AWAY EARLY SUNDAY AT AGE 75 OF A CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE. POLICE ARE EAGER TO QUESTION THE PERSON OR PERSONS WHO PHONED AN AMBULANCE FOR THE ONE-TIME PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL, BUT THEY SAY WHOEVER PLACED THE CALL HUNG UP WITHOUT GIVING A NAME. IS THAT YOU THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT? YES. WHERE DID BILLY GO? I HAVE NO IDEA. HIS IDEA. WILL YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN? SOMEDAY. [KNOCK KNOCK] SIR? GOVERNOR. UH, THERE'S A BIG CROWD UPSTAIRS AWAITING YOUR PRESENCE. 2 MINUTES, BUCKLE. NOW... THE $2 MILLION QUESTION. WHAT ABOUT LA BRANDINI? THAT ALL DEPENDS ON WHERE SHE STOPS HER STORY. WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP OUR NERVE, THEN, WON'T WE? THANK YOU... FOR GIVING ME THIS LAST CHANCE. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. I PROMISE. THE CRAZY PROMISE IS THE SACRED ONE. DO I KNOW YOU? [CROWD CHANTING ON TV] TV anchorwoman: DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN ALL CORNERS OF THE COUNTRY ARE NERVOUS TONIGHT, PONDERING-- AS ONE PUNDIT PUT IT-- THE MEANING OF BLAKE PELLARIN.
