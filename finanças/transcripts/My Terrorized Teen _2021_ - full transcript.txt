[music] [Grace] Please, please don't do this. I promise I won't say anything, you just let me go, please. [music] All right, Soph, tell me about what you're doing on history today. Honestly, Emma, it's just a silly rumor. Parent-teacher conferences are going on, what if... what if one of my teachers tells my dad they've heard I'm knocked up? You know how strict he is. He won't let me out of the house until graduation. I mean, you can always pee on a stick and prove it's a rumor. You are so not going to be my fake baby's godmother. Okay, look, no one is gonna tell your dad. Teachers, they don't pay attention to gossip. At least that's what my mom is always saying. And besides, we only have four months left until graduation, then we'll be free of Carolyn Carter and her minions. And what if college is full of people like Carolyn Carter? Don't worry. I have it on good authority that once everyone gets there, they'll feel small and insignificant. That's supposed to encourage me? [school bell ringing] Hey, mom. Hello, my darling daughter. What brings you by? I'm just getting a ride home with Emma, since you've got conferences this afternoon. Okay. Oh, listen, I was thinking of grabbing Chinese on the way home, any requests? Yes. Curry chicken, Kung Pao beef, lots of lo mein, potstickers, egg rolls and wontons. Is that it? Look, whatever else you want. I don't know how you can eat like a 300-pound linebacker and still weight two pounds. Your genes. Ah, no. That gift was your father's, for sure. [music] I hate speaking of Emma. Oh, no, she isn't knocked up. I didn't think she was, she's not normally on the rumor radar. Yeah, well she's the latest victim of "Living Hell." What is that, some kind of game? Oh, it's just some website Carolyn Carter and her friends made to torment whoever annoys them. That sounds terrible. I guess they made it over the summer when Glenn Williams dumped... Didn't realize they've broken up. Yep, he cheated on her and this is their way of trashing him. How did you see this? It happened Lindsey Colbert told me about it and how Emma is their latest victim. What on earth did sweet little Emma do to get on Carolyn's bad side? Well, Emma was tutoring Jack in French class. Carolyn's boyfriend. Yep, and he fell in love with Emma and dumped Carolyn. Really? Okay. Jack and Carolyn had been the couple of the school for a long time. - I know, since like the beginning of sophomore year, which is like decades in old people relationship time. Must have been a tough blow. And, while I feel bad for Carolyn, this website is something I can't ignore as a teacher. You speak mean girl. I speak mother. Actually, I think I have a parent conference with Paula Carter tomorrow afternoon. I'll speak to her, hopefully she can convince Carolyn to take this website down before I have to speak to Principal Dugger about it. Good luck with that! Listen, I have a parent conference with Daniel Todd's parents in a minute. This isn't gonna be pretty. Got it, I'm out. Oh, hey, I wanna hear more about this website later. [exhales] All right, what would feed a village for a day should fill you up for a few hours. What's this? I would say it's a letter to me, but since it's opened I know it can't be. It's an approval from the bank for a new mortgage. Sophie N. Ellis you have no business opening my mail! You just paid off your mortgage, we celebrated. You said you were finally free! What can I say, I'm just writing the check every month. I told you I was gonna get student loans. And I told you over my dead body am I letting you graduate under a mountain of debt. But I can't let you do this. First of all, young lady, I can do whatever I want. I'm the mom. I've earned it. If I wanna take all my money and go to Vegas, blow it on red 29, I will, and if I wanna spend it on the education of my one and only daughter, I will do that too. Your future is worth a thousand mortgages to me, so, drop any wild ideas you have about me not putting you through college and eat your MSG. [music] Drop off before you graduate and I'm gonna expect a full refund. [Paula] I gotta go, Kevin, we'll discuss it later. Grace, I am so sorry. No problem, Paula, glad you could make it. Okay, this has been the longest week of my life. At least it's almost over. Oh, yeah. Would Mr. Carter be joining us? Oh, he's... I'm afraid not, he's been overseas, on business, which has not helped, anything. I'm sure, might actually explain something. About what? Well, Carolyn's been doing exceptionally well in my class as usual. Well, she loves history and she's always loved you, so, there's that. Oh, she's one of my best students, but I've heard about a website that Carolyn and her friends have that fosters bullying. [music] I wished that I could say I was surprised, but honestly, Grace, Carolyn's been acting out so much with Brian gone. I'm sure she misses her dad. And he would know what to do, I mean, I love Carolyn more than anything, but her father... Let's just say she's always been daddy's little girl. And, you know, Brian has this tendency to spoil her and I tell him it is not healthy for her to get everything she wants all the time but, I mean, she just had him wrapped around her finger since the day she was born. Must make his absence that much harder and I'm sure that break up with Jack didn't help. You have no idea how heartbroken she is, Grace. I'm sure. Unfortunately, the website is currently targeting Emma Austin. Oh, I see. [Grace] And while I feel terrible that Carolyn got hurt, making someone else miserable isn't the answer. Of course not, can I see this site? I honestly don't know how to access it, but I heard about it from a reliable source. Sophie. Okay. Yes, and well I know that Carolyn and Sophie aren't friends, they share almost every honors class together, I'd hate to see friction arise because of a rift between Carolyn and Emma. I wouldn't want that either. It's just so difficult with Brian being overseas, the time difference makes it so hard to connect. It's Carolyn senior year, he's missing so much... I'm sorry, like I said, it's been a long week. I've been there, believe me. Oh, thank you. I'll talk to Carolyn, we certainly didn't raise her to bully people. Thanks, Paula, I appreciate it. Any mother, just wants what's best for their child. I couldn't agree more. Ah! Sophie, good, you've made it. Sorry, Principal Dugger. It's something wrong? Oh, no, no, no. I've asked you and Carolyn to be here to give you the good news. The school board announced the winner of the Wilson Award. Oh, well, this is such an honor. Congratulations, Sophie, you are this year's recipient and the winner of the $250,000 scholarship. No, ah, no, this must be a mistake. That award is mine. I don't know what to say! I do, this is ridiculous, how did I not win? Oh, well that's good news Carolyn, you did win the second place award of $5,000. $5,000? $5,000? Are you kidding? Is this some kind of joke? Well, it was a very thigh contest, I promise you. Both of you ladies have been wonderful representatives of Morgan Academy, from your stellar performance in the classroom to the many hours of volunteer work and giving back to the community. How did I get second place? This is rigged, her mother works for the school, she must have influenced the vote. [Principal] Now, I understand your disappointment miss Carter, but you shall not besmirch the good name of the school nor its faculty. Sophie's mother was not given a vote, and the very insinuation of impropriety is beneath both you and this institution. This isn't over. Oh, babe! Honey, what's wrong? I didn't get the Wilson Award. That's impossible! Deb told me you had it in the bag. Well, that's the good news, I got second place. How, honey? I lost to Sophie Ellis, sure her mom got all her teacher pals to vote for her instead of me. Wait a minute, this doesn't have anything to do with that website I mentioned, does it? No, I told you, I don't know what she's talking about. Well, I didn't think so. This isn't over. I'm getting that award back. No, Carolyn. Hey, why don't you let me handle this? I can speak to Principal Dugger. He can't do anything! I wished daddy were here, he would know what to do. He would know how to fix this! Great, we're already ten minutes behind schedule. I don't know why I continue to volunteer to supervise this thing year after year. Because you love it and you know it. I do. I'm actually ashamed to admit how much I look forward to this stupid talent show. And you say I need to get a life. You do, that is still a fact. And once Sophie is out of the house, I'm gonna come drag you out of that cave of yours and you're gonna meet someone. I already found the love of my life, how do you replace that? Girl, I'm not talking about getting hitched, I'm talking about meeting some hot, Huge Jackman type for coffee. - I hear... - Or something. Oh, I hear Huge is pretty happily married. Well, he's not likely to frequent the kind of establishments I'm gonna take you to either. No, I'm not gonna let you talk me into going to that strip club because I've just seen "Magic Mike" a Channing Tatum. I will be not doing that again. Eww! Party pooper. Excuse me, miss Warner, my ride is here, can I go on next? I'm sorry, honey, final dress rehearsal, so we gotta run through it in order. I'd be happy to give you a ride home. No, that's okay. I'll just get a ride home from Tara. I get the feeling that girl never hears the word "no." I don't think you're wrong. Okay. Break a leg! Sorry, I wish she would just take her anger out on me. Eww! Jack, he's so ugly. Yeah. Bye, Jack. Having regrets? You know I'm not. Especially now that she's showing her true colors. Can't worry about her now, we're up! [Jack] You've got this. [music] Look how cute they are! Aww! [music] Emma! [Jack] Emma! It's okay. Are you okay? Don't move her, don't move her. [phone dialing] Hello, this is Grace Ellis at Morgan Academy, we need an ambulance at the auditorium, a student was struck by lightning equipment. Yes, okay. Stay on the line with the operator. Okay. She's breathing but unconscious. How could this have happened? Rats. Rats? The place is full of them. And they like nothing better than chewing through wire, I gotta replace a bunch of it every year. It's not your fault, like you said this place is old, these things happen. They just normally don't happen this close to home. [sobbing] [laughing] Hey there, So. Busy weekend? Pretty much spent it at the hospital with Emma. Hmm, yeah. So, you're free Friday night? Tyler, when are you gonna get it? I'm not interested, not now, not ever. Yeah, whatever. Not like I want the quarterback's sloppy seconds anyway. Lindsey, don't stick up at me like that. Is it true? No, Emma isn't pregnant. Is not that! Is it true about you and Jack? Is what true about me and Jack? That you and Jack spent the weekend together? Oh, yeah, with Emma... in the hospital. So you didn't go to Creamy Count with him? Well, yeah we did for Emma. We got a bunch of ice cream, brought it back to the hospital to Emma. According to Tara McDonna, you two were pretty cozy. Oh, please. Jack and I barely know each other. I'm just telling you what I heard, in case it gets back to Emma. She knows, she's the one that told us to go together, to get to know each other. I guess that makes sense. And besides, consider your source. Tara is Carolyn's best friend. She would say anything. I would never do that to Emma. That's what I thought, it'd be pretty messed up. Yeah, it would be. That's why I didn't do it. Ask Jack. He's not here today. It figures. Whatever. I know it's not true, Emma knows is not true and really that's all I care about. It's not true! Okay, ladies. Suggestions? She was getting awfully cozy with Mr. Brennan the other day. Oh! I like it. She's such a goodie to choose. That doesn't mean she wouldn't cozy up with Mr. B. Seriously, who wouldn't? [laughs] Okay, but it's gonna take more than that to get the Wilson back. Obviously she got her mom to talk crap to all of her teacher friends. Maybe Sophie did more than talk. Yeah. What about her dad? He's dead, how does that help? Well, I mean cancer? He didn't seem unhealthy to me. Okay, even I don't... Even I don't think Sophie would kill her own father. It's not what I'm saying. What if her dad decided that he couldn't handle being her dad anymore? Suicide? Okay, I like it. Let's just start. Don't worry, Carol, we're gonna make sure that Sophie Ellis regrets she ever got that award. Knock knock. Hey, Tom, come on in! It won't take long, I know how much I enjoy my free periods. You're fine, I was in the middle of a argument about how Van Gogh is the father of the selfie movement. Well, he did love to paint himself. [Grace] That's the thesis. So, what can I help you with? An article about composting, I thought you'd like it. Wow, Tom, I'm flattered that you thought of me when you were reading about trash. Ha, not trash, healthy stuff. I remember you saying that you kill everything that you put in a garden, and now with planting season upon us, there's nothing a garden loves more than a lil fresh compost. Please tell me you're not one of those people that talks to plants. Actually, I like to play them Vivaldi, and the flowers, they love him, they... they are huge fans. And you know this because they throw their petals on stage? I know this because they sway. Sway. You sure that's not a backyard breeze? No, no, nope, they're jamming out. [laughs] Anyway, look, you don't need a lot of healthy stuff, some eggshells, coffee grounds, any leftover food. Leftovers, Sophie eats as much as three teenage boys, but I have plenty of coffee grounds, eggs, a few moldy cucumbers in my bottom drawer that I'm just scared to look at. Oof, you're worse off than I thought. Maybe I should come over and assess the situation in person. Well, Mr. Everett, is that your subtle way of inviting yourself into my home? Of course not, miss Ellis, I'm nearly trying ♪ to help the helpless, the plants are the helpless ones, not you, I hope, again, for the sake of the plants. Well, I'm free Friday night, and I'm sure Sophie will spend the night at Emma's. Dinner at 06:00? Only if you let me make it. I can live with that deal. Friday night. [music] I'm getting that award back. It never belonged to you, Carolyn. It was mine, I deserved it. So did I, you already have everything, Carolyn. Why can you just be happy with that? Don't think for a second you know anything about my happiness, you're only at this school 'cause your mom is a teacher and you get a free ride as a perk. It doesn't matter how I got here, I earned everything I have after, including the Wilson. Mr. Hill, thank you much. Mom? What are you doing here? Oh, Mr. Hill has his period free, I had to reschedule my conference. Oh, my gosh! You're doing so well I hear. Second only to one person. Hey! I believe in you! We're starting our experiment tomorrow, maybe she'll blow herself up. How you dare say something like that on purpose. Mom, I'm serious, besides I sit right behind her, wouldn't want to get caught in flames with her. [knocking] [Grace] Knock knock! [music] Ugh, my tan is fading. Let's spend the afternoon by your pool, Carol. It's like 30 degrees outside. Okay, so we'll jump in the hot tub. I need to get sunshine. Sorry, babe. My mom is redoing the whole backyard, it's a disaster. - Again? Don't you just put in the new gardens? Yeah, she's getting a grotto, whatever that is. She just wants someone else to bust... since daddy will be stuck in Japan for another month. I hear that a new saloon on third lets you stay in the tanning bed for however long you want. My cousin goes there, they give champagne to everyone, they don't even bother carding. Okay, I'm free this afternoon. One of you will have to drive then, my Jag is in the shop. I thought I saw you getting towed the other day. Yeah, the engine just won't start. As soon as daddy gets back, I'm demanding a new car. I can't live like this. Yes. I mean it could be worse. I could be the half orphan charity case child of a civil servant who doesn't even have their own car. Good afternoon, class. Let's get started. You should have your ingredients and your instructions. Be careful measuring, exact and precise, please. You may begin when ready. Step one? Four milliliters of compound A. [music] Next? Two milliliters of compound B. [explosion and screaming] [Lindsey] Sophie, your arm! Quick, quick! Let's get her to the nurse's office. [Grace] At least the doctor said there shouldn't be any scarring. - Whatever. How could Mr. Hill could have let something like this happen? I was pouring the ingredients, I screwed up somewhere. Why don't you take the next few days off from school, get some rest. I can't, I have a test on Thursday and Mr. Barnes' student review tomorrow. I'm sure he'll understand and give you a few extra days. - It's fine! - Hey! Are you gonna tell me what's bothering you? I don't wanna talk about it. [Grace] You should, it'll make you feel better and if I need to speak to someone's parents I will. Why? So my mommy can fight my battles for me? How pathetic is that? I'm not trying to fight your battles for you, but we can figure out a solution together. Some things just can't be fixed. [Chris] Did you hear about Sophie Ellis and Mr. Brennan hooking up in the teacher's lunch? [Tyler] Dude, I believe it, she's a freak. Like you would know. I mean, I don't like to brag and that was like year but yeah, I totally hit that. Hot? Dude, so freaking hot! But she got all clingy and desperate after. [Chris] Oh, yeah? Yeah, after I dumped her, she kept texting me pics trying to win me back but believe me, no amount of her "dunk bod" is worth that kinda crazy. Amen, my brother. Still, maybe I gotta hop in line and see what all the fuzz is about. [Tyler] That's what I'm saying! Tyler, Christopher! Do you boys need a visit to Principal Dugger's office to remember how we speak about our peers at this school? No, miss Ellis, we know. Come on, let's go. [Emma] Hey, I'm sorry you've been having such a crappy week. It doesn't help that you weren't there. When are you coming back? The doctors cleared me to return on Friday, Friday, yeah. Great, so I just have to suffer through tomorrow. I don't see how you think my presence is going to help, last time I checked Carolyn was still pretty pissed at me. Misery loves company. And Carolyn loves misery, doling it out anyway. I mean, can you imagine actually hooking up with Mr. Brennan? I think a lot of girls have, he's pretty hot. And old, he's like 30. Brad Pitt's like a 100 and he's still hot. He's Brad Pitt. This is just creepy. It's just silly rumors, remember? Well, you can prove you're not pregnant, I can't prove that I didn't hook up with Mr. Brennan or Jack. I know you weren't with Jack, you don't even have to worry about that. If I don't have nothing with success tomorrow I'll totally bail on school. Ignoring your problems isn't going to make them go away. You sound just like my mom. I'm serious, Sophie. Carolyn isn't fooling around. A rumor like this could cost Mr. Brennan his job. Just be thankful you're not in his position. No, I just get to lose my good name and reputation. Oh, what's that worth now anyways? [music] Hey! It's almost 11, where are you going? - Out. - [Paula] Out to where? Out with Tara. It's a little late on a school night to be socializing. We're studying. Why can't you do that here? God! Enough with the third degree already. Daddy would let me go without such a fuzz. Well dad is not here, I am. I don't want you going out this late. Tara is waiting. Get back here! Carolyn! Carolyn! Carolyn! [spray painting] Subtle, I like it. I don't know, guys. Maybe we went too far. There isn't such a thing as going too far. Not until I get that award. All right, everybody, let's go, let's go. Everyone has a class to get to, right? Let's go, let's go! Cellphones away and down, thank you. Let's go, let's go! Are you okay? Yeah? Ready to go inside? Let's go. Let's go. I'm telling you, sir, this girl has to be stopped. Grace, you don't have any proof that Carolyn Carter is responsible for this graffiti. Carolyn has been tormenting Sophie since she won the Wilson Award last week. Well, I'll admit that she was very disappointed to have lost, but I don't know that we can draw any conclusions regarding her handing this. [Grace] It has to be her, Sophie has no enemies. Well, I've met with Mr. Vincent this morning, we went over the security footage, nothing was caught on camera. It isn't just the vandalism. Really? What else is there? [Grace] Carolyn and her friends have a website that targets anyone who makes them angry. Can I see it? It's a private website, you need a username and password to access it. Well, that sounds quite complicated. Not to these kids, they code in their sleep, creating a website is easy. Well, if it's all anonymous, how can you be sure miss Carter is responsible? You know kids talk, Bill. Word gets around. Well, I'll talk to her, Grace, but without seeing the site for myself, my hands are fairly well tied. I'll try. I hope so, because Carolyn Carter is a very angry young woman who's making Sophie's life miserable. It has to end. [music] Hey, Soph. You know, my parents are out of town for the weekend, why don't you come over? Seriously? How many times do you have to hear the word "no"? What the hell! You'd get with everyone but me? I'm not getting with anyone, Tyler. Yeah, not what I hear. I don't care what you hear, get it through your head, you and me are never gonna happen. You're making a big mistake, Sophie. Somehow I doubt that. Big mistake. [music] Oh, Carolyn. Please have a sit. It's something wrong, sir? Perhaps, I heard some rumors regarding yourself and a bullying website? I don't believe in bullying, sir. I assume Sophie Ellis told you about this? My source is irrelevant. Well, I'll be honest, Principal Dugger, I wasn't happy to losing the Wilson to Sophie, but I am over it. Is that so? I can't do anything about it, can I, sir? No, I suppose not. Out of curiosity, this website, did Sophie... I'm sorry, did your source show it to you? No, unfortunately I've hit a dead end in locating it. You don't intend to punish me for hearsay? Of course not, I require proof of any allegation brought against any student or teacher, but I do intend to continue to look into this matter and the responsible party will be suspended. Oh, I assume so, sir, and I assure you, it will not be me. [music] Hey, Soph! Hey, Lindsey. I didn't see you in Spanish class today. I didn't feel well. Look, Sophie, there's something that I have to show you. This is sick! Carolyn really isn't gonna be happy until you give up that award. That isn't gonna happen, I need that scholarship money. How did you get on this? Mindy Gordano, she got an invite from Carolyn with a username and password and she just had to show me, she forgot to log off, so I thought I'd check it out. It's pretty awful stuff. I should take this to Principal Dugger. That won't help. All the comments are posted by anonymous users, you certainly couldn't prove that Carolyn was behind it. It's ridiculous. Carolyn is crazy rich, why does she care so much about the stupid award? Bragging rights? Carolyn's been telling people that she's gonna win this award for years. Well, she didn't. I did. Why doesn't she get over herself? People like Carolyn Carter are used to getting what they want. She can't have this. I'm not gonna let my mom to cut a new mortgage on our house. Then I guess you may have to suffer a little bit more. [music] Hello? I'm here, hello! [loud noise] This school needs some mouse traps. Hello? If you don't come out I'm bailing. Oh, God! Sophie, you scared me. I scared you? Are you kidding? I knew you'd change your mind. Change my mind about what? About us. I haven't. I'm only here for the proof that you have. Proof I have? Of what? About Carolyn. [Tyler] What about her? Look, are we gonna hook up or not? No, Tyler, definitely not. What on earth makes you think I'm here to hook up with you? Ahm, you left me that hot note? Yeah, not cool to get a guy all worked up and then blow him off like that. I didn't leave you any hot not, Tyler. So, you have proof that Carolyn is behind the "Living Hell" website. The Living He... Look, I don't even know what that is. You've been played. We both have. I still don't know why. Oh, no! What time is it? Great, I'm late! Hey, where are you... Hey, no one likes a tease, Sophie! I'm sorry I'm late. And I'm sorry, miss Ellis, but the class has already begun the test. Look, I can explain. Miss Ellis, you know the rule, once the exam begins, no one in, no one out. It's a steadfast rule that applies in all cases, for all cases. I had an emergency. - Then you have a doctor's note? - [Sophie] No, it wasn't that kind of emergency. Miss Ellis, you're disturbing the entire class with this display. You know my rule, you chose to ignore it and now you must pay the price. Mr. Barnes, if you let me explain, I... [Mr. Barnes] I'm not interested in excuses, actions have consequences, young lady. I suggest you remember that for the future. - But I... - The library, miss Ellis, out. I don't know about you, but I'm so glad tomorrow is Friday. Definitely. Are you okay? You look a little tired. I'm not sleeping very well. Mmm, must be running in the family. I don't know what to do, Wen. I'm not being able to help Sophie. Are things getting out of hand? Ahm, I know all this bullying is stemming from a website that I can't seem to find and no one seems to know about. Yeah, it's easy to get lost in the internet. Especially when everything is anonymous. Yeah. And Dugger called Carolyn into his office to question her, but of course she denied knowing what he was talking about. It's probably not easy to find an anonymous site either. Like trying to find a unicorn. Hang in there! Sophie will get through this. I told myself that, but it kills me to see the flat look in her eyes, just lost her sparkle. I miss it. Yeah, being a teenager is hard, but Sophie's always been a happy kid. Exactly. And now to she has to worry about this, she's miserable. I'm so scared thinking about the harm that she could cause herself out of desperation. It's exhausting. Yeah, most of being a mom is, from what I've seen. But come on, you couldn't possibly think Sophie would ever hurt herself? I'm not sure how much more Sophie can take. Thank you. If it isn't he infamous Sophie Ellis. Whose boyfriend's did you steal today? I'm not trying to steal Jack, Tara. Believe me, I think you're doing Emma a favor. I mean, she stole him from Carolyn, so it makes sense that someone else steals him from her. No one is trying to steal anyone. Jack is an almost grown man who can make up his own mind. Yeah, well, his lack in judgement shows that he really isn't in his right mind. Bitter much? Not bitter, just glad to see that you've finally been called out for "little miss perfect" charade you got going on. Let people talk, I know the truth. You know, funny thing about the truth, you get enough people thinking something is real and eventually it becomes true. [music] [sobbing] Hey, I have a headache and don't feel like cooking. Pizza okay? Whatever, I'm not hungry, I'm just gonna go for a run and crash early. [music] I'll be back. Hey, careful, it's gonna get dark soon. [dog barking] [music] [car accelerating] Oh, no! That was fast. What happened? This crazy car almost hit me. Okay, we should call the police. No, it didn't actually hit me, it was going so fast I didn't even see it. Let's get the first aid kit. Hey, babe. Dinner's ready. I'll be down in a minute. Are you studying for a big exam? A physics tomorrow. Whoever gets the highest grade doesn't have to take the final. Oh, I bet you'll get it. Unless Sophie Ellis does. She's aced every other test this semester. You don't worry about her. I have my conference with Mr. Bruno tomorrow, I can put in a good word for you. It's not a popularity contest, mom. I know. Honey, hey, don't worry about everything, it's gonna be okay. Nothing is okay, mom. I just... I wished daddy were here. I do too, babe. But hey, you and I we're just gonna have to make do on our own from now. This is all your fault. Daddy would know what to do. You know what, Carolyn? You can't just blame me for everything. Your father spoiled you, Carolyn. You don't get everything you want in life. I do, and daddy didn't spoil me, he loves me, he would do anything for me. [Paula] So would I. You can't fix this! Daddy would know what to do. Just tell me what to do, daddy. [music] It's nice to see you smiling this morning. It's Friday, this week is finally over and Emma is coming back to school today. Still spending the night at her house tonight? Yep, she's feeling a lot better and I feel several peperoni pizzas in our future. To have the stomach of a teen again. You sure you're okay with Mr. Everett coming over for dinner? Sure, I mean, it would be weird if I had classes with him this semester, but I don't, so it's cool. Besides, he's super-hot for an old dude. Thanks, mostly. [laughs] [music] [Sophie] Oh, Lindsey, have you seen Emma? I'm staying in her house tonight but I don't see her car. Are you kidding? After the picture. What picture? It was texted to the entire student body once the seventh ended. Explain this. That's not me. Sure looks like you. Are you kidding me? Are you telling me that people think this is real? Emma thinks this is real? She must, I can't blame her. Thanks, Lindsey, you've known me forever. How can you think this is true? This is pretty hard to dispute, Sophie. A real friend would believe me. You have some nerve showing your face here. Are you kidding me? You can't honestly tell me that you think that picture is real. I saw it, it looked real enough to me. Anything can be faked these days! Are you seriously telling me you think I was with Jack? Is that what you really think? I don't know what to think, Sophie. You're supposed to think that I'm your best friend and I would never in a million years do something like this to you! You know, I really thought that you and Jack being together was just a rumor, I guess not. How can you not believe me! Pictures can be faked! This doesn't look fake to me! What about the shirt, Emma? Have you ever seen me wear anything like it? Okay, for all I know is new. Oh, so I went out and bought myself a designer shirt before deciding to hook up with Jack. Sounds like me. And Jack, you can't tell me that he didn't deny this. [Emma] Of course he did. So you're willing to believe Carolyn over the both of us? What would you do if you were in my position? This isn't the first picture I've gotten of you two. What? Nikola Davis sent me a picture of you and Jack at lunch yesterday, you two looked pretty cozy. He stopped by my table to borrow notes for our English midterm. Are you kidding me? I laugh at one lame joke and that makes us cozy? It's just all so much, Sophie. I don't know what to believe. Believe me! I would believe you. I've always had your back. I never thought you wouldn't have mine. [music] [Grace] Where did you learn how to cook like this? My mom believed that good food was the answer to all of life's problems. She's not wrong about that. Especially when paired with a good wine. Amen to that. Cooking is hard work. My mommy used to spend hours preparing our Sunday night diners only to have the family devour everything in less than ten minutes. But weren't they a glorious ten minutes? I never thought of it like that. Yep, life is always full of trade-offs. Most people work 50 weeks a year doing a job they hate, just to spend 2 weeks doing something that they love. - Not you. - No! I love teaching. A lot of times you get kids that just need to pass the class, but when you really reach someone. It's transformative. Yes. Soph! Everything okay? Give me a minute, will you? If you need me to clear out, just say the word. Oh, don't you dare. I'll be back in a minute. Hey! What's wrong? I don't wanna talk about it. [Grace] Did something happen with Emma? I said I don't wanna talk. Come on, Soph, don't shut me out. I know how hard this week's been on you. You have no idea what a nightmare my life has been. Then tell me. I know that you're miserable, I'm here to help. Don't you see that? I mean, I'm your mom, it kills me to see you in pain. You wouldn't understand, you're a teacher, you don't see what kids at that school are really like. I know what you're like, I know how you feel. You have no idea how I'm feeling! Did you ever think what this week has been like for me? How it feels to hear such a vile filth said about my daughter? I can't help what people say. [Grace] I know the rumors aren't true. I feel so helpless, knowing that you're in pain and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I would give everything to make this entire nightmare end. How you don't see that is beyond me. [sobbing] It's blended. I guess I kinda spaced out. So how was your weekend? Terrible. [Wendy] Terrible? I thought you had a hot date with Tom Friday night. I did, and for 45 glorious minutes I enjoyed myself immensely. And then? And then Sophie came home, apparently she and Emma had a huge blow up and we had a huge blow up and spent the weekend in our respective bedrooms. Tom was nice enough to reschedule. I did get to eat the lobster rolls he made before leaving. I was alone and sobbing, but... at least they were delicious. Emma probably saw the picture. What picture? Sophie didn't tell you? Sophie isn't telling me anything. On Friday, someone sent the entire student body a photo of Jack and Sophie kissing. How did I not hear about this? It happened right at the end of seventh period. I only know because I made my student show me when I heard them talking about it as they were leaving. - Show me. - Girl. You don't need to see it! You know it's not Sophie. Show me. Okay. This isn't Sophie. You gotta admit that looks a lot like her. No and this isn't Sophie. I know every piece of clothing in this girl's closet and I know for a fact that Sophie doesn't own a silk shirt like this girl is wearing. That is pretty fancy for Soph. I believe I've seen Carolyn Carter wearing something similar. It probably wouldn't be too hard to put Sophie's head on Carolyn's body. [Grace] Not with the kind of editing people can do these days. No wonder Sophie was so upset, she must have been devastated that Emma didn't believe her. It is a pretty convincing photo. Emma should have known that Sophie would never betray her like that. Grace, they're best friends, they'll figure it out. Best friends always do. I hope so, Wen. Sophie's already got so much going on planning for college. And the scholarship means a lot to her. Yeah, I know. And it's such a shame to have Carolyn taint it with her jealousy. [Grace] The way things are going I'm scared that Sophie is not gonna come out of this mess unscathed. [music] [Carolyn] Miss Warner wants me to send out the debate schedule tomorrow, not my job, so annoying. Did it change? That's so annoying. Yeah. Wait, isn't Sophie in that class? Well, I think she is. [Carolyn] What if you send her the wrong time? What if you make it like really, really late or really early? Late. - [Tara] Yes, no. Oh my God. Okay. - Wait are you doing it? - Yeah. I'm doing it. Done. That [unintelligible] that perfect GPA. [Tara] It should. [knocking] You guys want a treat? Ahm, I'll take one to go. I have to get going. [Carolyn] Thanks, Tara. I'll pick you up tomorrow. - Homework? - Of a sort. Hey, you promised you're not involved in that website, right? I mean, 'cause that can really get you into trouble, Carolyn. Let it go, mom, I'm not. I'm concerned, Carolyn. And I overheard come of your conversation with Tara. So you're spying on me now? Honey, pranks are one thing. This could get you into trouble. So she misses one thing. [Paula] It sounded pretty important. It's not life or death. What if you get in trouble? You really want to get kicked out of school, after everything. Don't worry about me, mom, I'll be fine. Soph, what are you doing here? Aren't we leaving at 3:00? Mr. Hill took your group at 11:00. 11:00? The text I got said 3:00. No, I'm taking my group at 3:00 tomorrow. I can't miss this debate, it accounts for half of our grade. It's supposed to go until 5:00, maybe you can still make it down there, I'll be happy to give you a ride. No, thanks, I'll just grab my mom's keys. Honey, I am so sorry this happened. I asked Tara to let everyone know about the changes we had to make. Yeah, I'm sure she just made a mistake. [music] [car accelerating] Sophie! My goodness! What happened to you? This lunatic driver in the parking lot almost hit me. Are you okay? Yeah, just sore. I'm sorry I missed my debate time. Don't worry, Miss Warner texted me and told me to be on the lookout for you, I'll speak to the judges, let them know you've been in an accident and that you'll be good to go tomorrow. Thanks, Mr. Hill. There's a bathroom over there, why don't you go clean up? I'll give your mom a call as well. [music] Had a little accident? What are you doing here? Your group doesn't come until tomorrow. Just checking out the competition. What do you want, Tara? I want you to drop dead. How badly? Keep it while you still have a chance, the scholarship belongs to Carolyn. Why do you care? Because unlike you, I know how to be a good friend. We both know that picture of me and Jack is fake. Some of my best work if I don't say it so myself. Everyone bought it, including my best friend. And that's the difference between you and me. I'd do absolutely anything for my best friend. Anything. What happened? [Mr. Hill] Police thinks it may have been a distracted driver, there's a couple of officers with the director looking at footage from the outside cameras. I'm sorry, mom, for everything. So you didn't see anything? It was just a gold car, no one I know. Not Carolyn's car, if that's what you're thinking. You sure you're okay? Yeah, I just really wanna go home. Can I take her? [Mr. Hill] Sure, please have all the information if they need it. Come on, I'll leave Wendy's car here and come back for it later. No, I can drive. No, forget it. I'm sorry. Hey, no more apologies. Let's get out of here. [music] What's going on? I received an anonymous tip from someone who claims you stole the answers to your physics exam. I aced that test, I didn't need to steal the answers. I find it hard to believe myself, Sophie, but I'm obligated to follow through with any allegations of cheating. You're joking. I wish I were. I was told the answers are in your locker, after you tried to sell them to a fellow student before the exam. I didn't do such a thing. Come on, Bill, I told you this is ridiculous. I have nothing to hide, search away, you won't find anything. I told him this is a huge mistake, I saw how hard you studied for this test. This is very disappointing, Sophie. I've never seen those before, I don't know how they got in my locker. Oh, come on, Bill, you can't possibly think that Sophie stole those. Well, I certainly don't want to. Why would she cheat and then keep such incriminating evidence? Honestly I'm shocked to find them here. I've taught here 13 years, you've known Sophie just as long. You know that she's innocent. [Principal Dugger] My hands are tied here, Grace, this school has a zero tolerance policy regarding cheating. - She didn't cheat! - I didn't cheat! And I want to believe that. And I will launch a thorough investigation, Sophie, I promise. Beginning by asking Mr. Brennan how someone would acquire these answers. I swear I don't know how they got in my locker! Well, unfortunately, without disproving how they got there, I'm obligated to follow protocol. I'm very sorry Sophie but... I'll have to suspend you until further investigation. This isn't fair! Hopefully this will all be a simple misunderstanding. I would hate to see you lose the Wilson Award. I'm innocent! I'm being set up! I'm innocent! I'll prove it. Sophie! We'd better continue this conversation in my office. Hey, Soph, you have a minute? Have you seen Carolyn? No, but, Soph. I'm so sorry, I've been a jerk. Little bit. [Emma] I know that you weren't with Jack. Duh! It's just, Jack's the first real boyfriend that I've ever had and I just got crazy for a minute. Can you ever forgive me? I suppose. Carolyn hasn't made anyone's life easy. Why are you looking for her anyway? I wanna make her admit that she's the one who planted those test answers. You think that she's just going to confess? No, but maybe I can talk to her mom? I have to try something, I can lose the Wilson scholarship. She lives over in Elm, come on, I gotta take my little brother to soccer practice but I'll drop you off first. [music] [Emma] Good luck! Thanks. Bye, see ya! Tara, Tara. I'll catch up. Hey, miss Ellis! Tara, look, I'll be blunt. I know that Carolyn is setting Sophie up, I don't know why. You don't have any proof. Why, Tara. I mean, this isn't just about bragging rights, what's going on? Look, it's not really my business to say. Tara. She's broke, okay? Broke? Her dad got caught stealing money from his company. What? How did I not hear about this? I guess he took a plea deal to keep his name out of the press. Look, I'm the only one of Carolyn's friends who knows. That must have been terrible for Carolyn. It's just the beginning. What do you mean? The IRS seized all their stuff, I mean she had to drive her lawyer's car because hers got repossessed. Her house is being sold, she has nothing. I mean, what about the school, it's a small fortune. Yeah, she can finish out the year because her dad paid in advance, but after that, who knows... She can't get into college without that Wilson money. That's not true, she can go to plenty of colleges, good colleges, she'll just need to take outs student loans, it's not the end of the world. [Tara] It's the end of her world. Look, maybe now you understand why she's so angry. I do understand, I don't condone her actions. She's desperate. [Grace] I'm sure she is. Desperate people make foolish decisions and while I feel bad for Carolyn, I'm not about to let her ruin Sophie's life because she feels like her own life is falling apart. Thank you. [music] [bell ringing] Can I help you? My name is Sophie Ellis. I know who you are. Ahm, I need to talk to you about your daughter. Can I come in, please? Very well. The bank came for everything yesterday, it was quite the show, although I guess I should be grateful, this neighborhood is filled with condescending old bitties that don't know how to use a smart phone. I might have gone viral. I know about embarrassing scenes, that's why I'm here. Carolyn is setting me up, I'm sure of it. Is she? What exactly is she trying to do to you? She's trying to steal the Wilson Award, and do whatever it takes to sabotage me. Cheaters never prosper, Sophie. I... I didn't say what she set me up for. No? Oh, no you didn't. Your arm, you caused the explosion. It was supposed to do more damage. Oh, I'm so sorry, Sophie, that it's come to this, I really am, but Carolyn future's at stake! No! Hey, Sophie, it's me. Call me, ahm, I know that you're upset. Getting pretty worried. Where are you? Hey, Emma, it's Grace. Have you heard from Sophie? You did, that's great. No she hasn't been home and she's not answering her phone. Really? What's her address? Thanks, Emma. [música] I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Carolyn almost caught me, she's with Tara now, so. [muffled talking] You don't have to do this, I won't say anything, I promise. Carolyn can have the scholarship, just please let me go. Honey, I can't let you go now! Carolyn's already lost one parent and she's not gonna lose another. What are you talking about? Why are you doing this? Carolyn's father is not in Japan. Honey, he's in federal prison, doing ten years for embezzlement. I had no idea. [Paula] Well, no one does, now thanks to him, Carolyn has nothing. So you see, I can't let her lose that scholarship too. Honey, you would understand if you were a mother. My mother would do anything for my happiness, but she would never resort to murder. I didn't want to have to hurt you! I tried to make things easy. The burn on your arm, you could have killed Carolyn! Okay, I was desperate at this point, and, well Carolyn gave me the idea, jokingly. But then when I knew you sit in front of her in class I thought maybe I can concoct something just to get you out of the picture. Anyhow, I knew how far the explosion would go after a couple of tries. Oh my gosh, honey, I think it is so scary the things you find on the internet. You tried to run me down. Twice. I guess I'm gonna have to kill... Do you know the first time it was a total impulse? Yeah, I went for takeout and I found myself parked across from your driveway. I remember dropping Carolyn [unintelligible] birthday party. It seemed like so long ago and when you came out of the house I thought fate was telling me something. To kill a kid. No, I was gonna use the car, it's less personal, and have it look like an accident. Truly, honey, I hate the thought of taking your life. Frankly? I don't have the stomach for it and I tried to make it quick. There were no rats in the auditorium, were there? I'm sure there were some out there. Okay, so I sold some of Brian's things and wire cutters were just something no one wanted, it was... it was impulse! I guess you're just mad that Emma got hurt instead. I admit... I was a tad happy, I repaid her for stealing Jack from Carolyn. It was supposed to be over then and there, but like everything that I do, utter failure. It doesn't sound like you have the heart for murder either. And I really didn't, I wanted you out of the way. This is for Carolyn, I would do anything for her, no matter what she thinks, I would do anything for her. You know? I thought I had completely failed, when I saw those answers on Mr. Bruno's desk. You planted the test answers? It looks like a miracle! Okay, so he was in the middle of grading exams, right before a conference and when he wasn't looking, I snapped a couple of photos, printed them and... I've seen you, at your locker with Carolyn, so I knew I just had to put them after I made my anonymous tip. Gosh, I wished I had that opportunity first. Wouldn't have to go to these drastic measures. My mom knows I didn't cheat, she'll prove it. Well, it doesn't matter now. I'm really sorry, Sophie. You know motherhood is all about sacrifice. I'd do anything for Carolyn. Now, you and I are going to go on a little trip. We'll make it quick, I promise. No, you can't do this, no! No! - Don't make me have to knock you down! Help! Somebody help! Don't make this harder than it has to be! Keep your hands off my daughter! You, you've ruined everything! [Grace] It's not too late, Paula, you can still make this right. Nothing will ever be right! Carolyn wouldn't want this. You hated my daughter, 'cause she has everything. Now she has nothing. She has nothing! Mom [unintelligible] Don't worry, baby girl, you're safe, it's over now. [crying] [music] [applauses] There are the happy graduates. It all feels so good. Your speech was amazing, thank you so much. I meant every word, I wouldn't be here without you. On so many levels. Believe me I would do it all again in heartbeat, wouldn't change a thing. Except, maybe, the part of you almost being killed. Hey, Sophie, Emma, I just wanna say sorry again before I leave. It's okay. Yeah, we're good. Where are you headed? To stay with my grandparents. Yeah, they have a farm in Tulsa. I hope you find happiness, Carolyn. Okay, I know I should feel bad for her, but I'm honestly having such a hard time. This two-week suspension she got for the "Living Hell" website does not seem like enough punishment to me. I don't know how you can forgive her. It's easy, Em, she has nothing. I have everything I'll ever need. I always have. Okay, before the water wars begin again, let's celebrate, dinner's on me, I hear Carlito's is a favorite. Ooh, I'm starving. I'm gonna start with the shrimp cocktails but it does feel like a lobster kind of occasion. Let's just get one of everything, let's try it all. I like him. I like him too.
