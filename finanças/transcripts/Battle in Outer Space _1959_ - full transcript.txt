YEAR- 1965 Comm Center... Comm Center... This is Space Station J-SS3. Do you read us, over? This is Tokyo Space Comm Center. We read you here... Comm Center! Comm Center! Can you hear us? Can you hear us? Hey, something strange is heading for us! Comm Center! Comm Center! Can you hear us? Hey! Send an S.O.S.! We're under attack! Man the guns! Comm Center! Comm Center! Comm Center! Can you hear us? Comm Center! BATTLE IN OUTER SPACE (UCHU DAISENSO) Are we up to speed? We're up to speed. Oh! The bridge! The Space Station explosion and the Tokaido derailment are major disasters within themselves. However, our country is not alone in its disasters. Unexplained accidents have occurred all over the world. We go now to America. At 20:30 hours on the 18th... ... an accident occurred at the Panama Canal involving the ocean liner Blue Queen. A waterspout formed in the canal... ... lifting the liner only to send it crashing into the concrete barriers. Next, we go to Italy. An unexplained force, drew up vast amounts of water... ... into a waterspout, in the famous canals of Vienna. It caused floods throughout the historic district. In order to investigate these events... ... the world council has called a meeting at the Tokyo Space Comm Center. Delegates from around the world will be in attendance. It is clear, by an examination of the circumstances in these disasters... ...that there's a common force at work. The Tokaido train, the Blue Queen, and the floods in Venice show a remarkable similarity. Victims in the vicinity suffered from an extreme case of frostbite. It indicates that extremely low temperatures were produced at the time. This implies that by rapidly lowering... ...the temperature of a certain object, it will also lower its gravity. But, isn't it impossible to remove gravity... ...from a stationary object or certain place? Yes, you're right. It has been considered impossible up to now... ...but it has now happened here on earth. My colleagues from Japan will give you the explanation. The cause of the gravity is the motion of atoms. When the atoms of an object have no movement... ...its gravity decreases correspondingly. At absolute zero... ...the atomic movement of an object goes into a state of rest, and it becomes weightless. Without the centrifical force of the earth, the object affected would rise into the air. We are sure that recent disasters were caused by a force from outer space. All of our data points to this likelihood. Hello, Dr. Achmed. Has the conference ended? What's the matter with you? It's Dr. Achmed! Dr. Achmed's in trouble? You must be mistaken, Etsuko. Isn't Dr. Achmed still in conference with the others? But... I'm sure I... Hey, Iwamure. Prepare the heat ray for a test fire. Hey, Katsumiya... Etsuko is going a little crazy. You should take better care of her. If we acknowledge that earth... ...has entered the space age, we must admit that... ...as we venture into space, there must be other races... ...with an intelligence superior to ours, who have solved the problem... ...of space travel. Dr. Adachi... What do you think their purpose is in coming to earth? Wouldn't you say that they were impelled... ...by the same scientific curiosity we feel about them? Could it be they want to take over the earth? I really don't know what their intentions could be. Regrettably, only the future will tell us if their visit is a peaceful one. Unfortunately, we don't understand their language... ...but we should continue by all means possible, to urge peace. However, we should also research measures to repel them if we are attacked. Well then, that's all for today. This is Inspector Iriake of the International Police. Our newly developed ray gun. It produces narrow-band energy radiation, to the order of 600 megatherms. At maximum output, it will fire continuously for 20,000 hours... ...with a single charge of plutonium. We've lined up targets of metal... ...that are used for the armor of our S.P.I.P. Rockets. Up to now, it is the hardest substance known to man. The total thickness here is 215 millimeters. We're ready. Fire! Here is the result of a 30-second blast. These are our rocketships, the S.P.I.P.'s. Were they built in accordance with our original design? Yes... Do you see anything wrong with them? No, I think they're wonderful. I have to confess that I'm quite surprised. I didn't think you could build them so quickly. We did not do it alone. All of the nations of the world did this. Well, it's marvelous all the same. Congratulations, Doctor. At the moment, we're concerned... ...with adjusting the controls inside the spaceships. Launching them is just a matter of time. What is the deviation on the wave-motion index? I was just checking the figures. Itís 1 to 100,000 in the atmosphere... ...and 1 to 1,000,000 in space. Kogure... Okara. - Yes, sir. Good work. I'm sorry, but could you connect the controls to our master panel here? Roger. Go ahead. I'll test the engine on level one. Doctor, I'm Inspector Iriake of the International Police. Could you give me some information, please? - Yes, what can I do? I'm looking for Dr. Achmed. Is he around here? - Of course. Is it important? It involves police concerns. I want to ask him a couple of questions. Dr. Achmed! No, Doctor... he's not here. Iwomura! Iwomura! He must be in trouble! - There he is! - Whatís going on? Doctor, I think he was going to steal the gun. Dr. Achmed, is this true? You're under arrest. Come with me. You want me? Observe... The earth will soon become a colony of planet Natal. Achmed! There's no way you can escape! A spaceship! Doctor, I'm finished. Itís some kind of radio control device. Itís terrible... If it were planted on Achmed's brain... ...he would respond to their radio waves. It is clear that the people of Natal... ...have established a base on our moon and are planning to attack the earth. Mankind has lived on the earth for the past 500,000 years. We must be prepared to resist... ...the attacks of these intergalactic bandits in outer space. We will send two spaceships to the moon. Dr. Adachi will command the crew of the first ship. Dr. Richardson will command the crew of the 2nd ship. Dr. Adachi will now give us the details of their flight. We must consider this as a reconnaissance flight. We expect to land at a point about 100 kilometers north of the Sea of Rains. Our radio telescopes indicate that radio signals are being transmitted from there. It's so pretty. And there are people up there waiting to attack us. Itís more beautiful... ...when you imagine that there's a prince... ...that will come down to carry you away forever. But I wonder if mankind will eventually lose such feelings of beauty. But there's at least one thing that will never change. Itís forever... The one thing that will never change... Our love... The love that you and I share will never change. Right...? Am I right? Well... What about it? No! No... no! It won't change! It will never change between us! I know it will never change! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was being bad. I won't let it change. Hey... is it alright? Whatís so funny about that?! The way you were making her cry, I think that was much more cruel. Huh...? What did you say? Never mind. The truth is, I wanted to have some fun. There's nothing to do here. Where...? Anywhere in the world. There won't be any on the moon! You got that right. Well, I figure we could have a great time on the Ginza strip. How about it, Etsuko? Sure! No, we're fine on our own. "Just the two of us", he says. Well, if I'm on my own, I'm going! See you. - See you. - Goodbye. It is useless to struggle. Why did you travel down this road? Are you in pain? In a moment you will feel better. We have implanted our lives into your mind... ... and now you will become our slave. You will become our eyes and ears... ... and you will do our bidding without question. The process is completed. You are now a new robot for our cause. Now, go... go! Hey! You can't stop here! Get this thing moving! What happened to you? You have a cut on the left side of your head. There's a tremendous crowd here today... ... as a brilliant new chapter is written in the annals of mankind. Across the spacious grounds of the science center, the two rockets sit silently on their launching pads... ... waiting for the moment when they will carry aloft the hopes of the entire world. Present arms! At ease! The commander of the first ship is Dr. Richardson... ...and the commander of the second ship will be Dr. Adachi. Each crew consists of nine special technicians. The cars have stopped at the launching pad and the crews are boarding the gantry elevators. The fueling of the ships has completed. Everything's ready for takeoff and there's nothing... ...preventing a successful launch. Everything is ready. Launch in 120 seconds! Our spaceship is ready to go. Our spaceship is ready to go! I'm fine. Spaceship 1, report your status. Our spaceship is ready to go! Our spaceship is ready to go! We're ready to go. We're ready to remove the gantries. Sixty seconds to go. Ready the engines. Thirty seconds remaining. How are the readings? All stations, report status. Alright, engage automatic engine shutdown. Automatic engine shutdown. Switch over to space time. Space time. Well gentlemen, it looks like a success. You can remove your seat belts. It wasn't me! Somebody must have pushed me up here! Remember that there's no gravity up here. Be careful. - Right. Good joke. Put everyone on space procedures. Space procedures, everyone. Ship 2, Ship 2... This is Adachi. Are you here with us? This is ship 2. This is ship 2. Hull temperature is 170 degrees. Fuel consumption normal. We're all set. Engage space radar. Space radar detects several objects. Our radar detected them as well. The objects are just ahead of us. Doctor, what did we find? No, we don't know yet. Prepare the view screens. - Prepare the view screens. Give me a fix on them. I read them in quadrant three. - Switching to quadrant three. Those are pieces of the space station. It looks like they had no chance. Ship 1 is maintaining velocity at 75. We are at the 300,000 kilometer point. Course normal. Fuel consumption normal. Good. How far to the moon? 130,000 kilometers. Estimated time of arrival, 3 hours 36 minutes. I'm reading an unusual power level. Radar, is everything normal? Itís normal. Iwomura... Iwomura! What happened? Radar has detected objects closing in! They're coming in fast. Doctor, the objects are meteors! They're on a collision course for us! Speed?! Six hundred! Prepare the ray gun. - Prepare the ray gun! Coming into range... Now at300... - Right! Are we ready to fire? We're ready. This is Ship 2. We're ready to fire. Fire! Fire! Good... Now cut the power to their ray gun. Learn how to limit their power. They're coming in large numbers. I'm going to need assistance. Hadara, go find Iwomura. Right. The radar is picking up more meteors coming in! Doctor, I'm showing flying saucers on the other side of the meteors! Iwomura! Iwomura! What are you doing?! Iwomura! Fire! We're losing power to the gun! Stop that! Whatís the matter?! Don't do that! Don't do that! Doctor, itís no good! Fire the maneuvering rockets! Fire the maneuvering rockets! We're going to maneuver the ship! We're ready! Fire! Put us back on our original course. Katsumiya, we must solve our ray gun problem. - Yes, sir! Track where we've lost power! Iwomura! Iwomura! Iwomura, what happened? I caught him cutting the power to our ray gun. What? Well, let's take a look at him. Earthlings... ... hear us. Do not approach the moon. If you approach the moon, we will destroy you. Calling Dr. Richardson... Did you just hear that? Yes, but we can't afford to turn back now. We can't turn back. To do so would admit defeat. Earthlings... We are telling you to stop this useless mission. We do not want you to die. Return to earth! Return to your posts! Yes, sir! Track where the saucers are heading. Hadara. - Yes, sir. Iwomura seems to be in shock. See what you can do for him. - Right. We will be in the moon's gravity in 30 seconds. Slow down the ship to land on the moon. - No, Doctor. If we slow down... ...we'll come under fire. You're right. Okay, contact the other ship. - Right. Ship 2, Ship 2. Standby for landing instructions, over. Standing by... Dr. Richardson... ...the fate of the entire world is riding on us. We must proceed to land on the moon. Roger. Doctor, if we are to avoid radar detection... ...we should land close to the mountains in sector six. Yes, you're right. We're changing our point of impact to the east side of the mountains in sector six, over. Roger... We'll land on the east in sector six, over. Roger, roger. Prepare to land! Present altitude is 270 and falling. Estimated time to landing? About 240 seconds at current rate. Fire maneuvering thrusters! Firing! Halt maneuvering thrust. Estimated landing in 120 seconds. Now within 3 kilometers of the moon's surface. Fire landing engines! We've landed. Prepare to depart from the ship. Preparing to depart from the ship. Hadara. - Yes? We have to defend ourselves from Iwomura. I can tie him up for the meantime. Perhaps it would be best. Right. We will leave in sixteen minutes. - Roger. Doctor, will Iwomura be alright? We don't know how much control they have over him. Doctor... My! The earth looks so pretty! Okada! Okada! Are you okay? I'm fine. How do you like the 1/6th gravity? It won't be too difficult to manage. Well Dr. Adachi, we finally made it. Yes, we finally did, but our work is just beginning. We've got to find where the saucers are coming from and destroy them. Good hunting, and try to stay together. Letís go! Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Open your eyes! I have a radio wave 30 degrees to the right. Good. New heading, 20-30 degrees. - Now 20-30 degrees. Keep track of any new broadcasts. Man the observation dome. Power level check, do you read me? Power level check, do you read me? Roger, roger. You must blow up the spaceships! You must blow up the spaceships! Hurry! Hurry! Flying saucers! Katsumiya, hurry and follow them to their base. - Right. Get me rover 2. - Yes, sir! This is rover 2. For the sake of our safety... ...we'll have to increase our pace and follow them. Roger, roger. Doctor, the air pressure's increasing! - What?! Check the air lock. Activating thrusters. Doctor. Hurry! Hurry! Flying saucers! They must have come from a station hidden on the other side of those mountains. But it will be dangerous to go in the rovers. We'll have to go by foot. We're leaving the rovers here. We'll find the base on foot. Power levels normal. Radio is normal. Kodai, how close are we now? About 120 meters. 120 meters. Hurry! Hurry! Doctor, over there! Doctor, this looks like it goes right through the mountain. Yes, and its incredibly large. We should investigate. Shall we go? Kodai, go and get rover 1. Yes... Now go and prepare to blow up ship 2. Good... very good. Damn! This must be the base that they're going to use in their attack on earth! - Well Dr. Richardson, it looks like itís up to the two of us. Doctor, there must be a way to destroy it... Doctor, let me try to go in there. But, how...? Please let me try. He's right. The longer we wait, the more time they'll have to prepare defenses. - Let me go too. Etsuko, go to the rover and get the heat gun. - Right. Be careful, Etsuko. Sure. Doctor... I'm going, okay? No, wait a little longer. I'm still observing it. I've lost contact with the ship. I'll go check it out. Katsumiya! Katsumiya! Katsumiya! Etsuko! Etsuko! Etsuko, hurry! Earthlings, you ignored our warning to return to earth. Now we have destroyed your only means to return home. Damn! Doctor, let me go! I can do it! Wait... Firing your gun won't help us very much. Earthlings... ... this is your last chance. If you do not surrender to us in ten of your seconds... ... we will attack you. Make way! Make way! Prepare to fire. - Prepare to fire! Take aim! - Target in sight! - Fire! Hurry up! There's not much time left! Alright! Fire! Doctor, the base! Itís Katsumiya! Katsumiya is attacking them! We did it! I... I... Damn! Etsuko! Doctor! Katsumiya... - Itís okay, we beat them. Letís get to the other rover. Hey! Hurry! Hurry, hurry! I'm not too comfortable with those other ships flying around. Well, there isn't very much to worry about, with their home base destroyed. Yes... It was a great victory for earth. Prepare for ground mobility. - Prepare for ground mobility. 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... - Okay, setting down. Doctor, saucers dead ahead! Rover 2...? Yes, rover 2 is damaged. We can't leave them! Alright, shut down main engine. Come on, come on! Hurry! Hurry! Get moving! Hurry! Hurry it up! You fought well, Kogure. Main engine, ready. - Alright, letís get back to the ship. Move out. Where are the flying saucers? All screens are clear. Doctor, Ship 1 is gone! With the defenses it had... ...I don't think the flying saucers did this. Oh, no... You don't suppose Iwomura did this? I don't know... Anyway, we have to move. I have a job for you men. - Yes, sir. Ready the elevator for our rover and prepare the engines for takeoff. - Yes, sir! Flying saucers! Get inside! Hurry! Hurry! Itís Iwomura! Iwomura! Katsumiya, I was the one who blew up Spaceship 1. The space people turned me into their robot! I'm going to have my revenge! So hurry, get out of here! Iwomura! Doctor, goodbye! Katsumiya, goodbye and take care! Etsuko, please forgive me! Doctor... Itís so sad about Iwomura and the others... Hey, we're going to come back for you. Wait, alright? An explosion accompanied the return of the surviving spaceship to the earth. An explosion that would rock the course of humanity... ... and change earth into a united people, with one purpose. All over the world, people of all nations flock together... ... to seek safety under a common union. They insisted that their governments work together... ... against this enemy and for the defense of earth. From country to country, the cry was taken up... ... until it echoed around the world to the United Nations. We must check by every means at our disposal... ...the barbarous ambitions of the Natal spacemen. They are bound to fall upon us with a renewed attack after rebuilding their base. Dr. Adachi... Can you estimate how big a leap they have over us in their space technology? I can't say how far they are ahead of us... ...but they are farther ahead of us on a time perspective. While they may not be too far ahead... ...we should be ready to resist them the best that we can. We are developing a small scout ship armed to engage the saucers outside our atmosphere. It is clear that we are at war with Natal. The people of earth must begin preparations to face this threat! Emergency orders for the construction of the scout ships... ... were issued to factories worldwide. Day and night, the workers struggled to complete their production levels in time. The scout ships were produced in Siberia... ... then transported to launch sites throughout America. The Science Center became the base of operations. We have targets appearing at 80,000 kilometers. The radars have confirmed it. Gentlemen, they're at this point. Alert the other bases. - Notifying the bases. Hungary! - Hungary! Osio! - Osio! Copenhagen! - Copenhagen! This is Space Control calling Russia, over. Immerman speaking... My first fighter squadron is now taking off. There's not much more we could do for mankind besides these rockets. It better work well the first time. We won't be able to send anyone else out. Yes. Comm center! Comm Center! This is the advance patrol, over. Yes, this is the Comm Center. We're in Space Sector E. The saucers are beginning... ...their entry through this point. I'm going to confirm their course. A squadron of flying saucers... ...is escorting a mother ship saucer into earth's orbit. We will engage them in space. Launch! This is the Space Center. The enemy is confirmed in earth's orbit. Launch and assist Squadron 1! We're all set! Takeoff! This is Group B. We're at 4000 kilometers. Rendezvous is in 30 seconds. This is the captain of the reinforcement group. My altitude is 5000 kilometers. Enemy's in sight and I'm preparing to attack, over. Fire! They're firing space torpedoes at earth! They launched a wave of torpedoes. They're on a direct course for earth! Attack vector, 110 degrees. Azimuth, 70 degrees. Lock them on radar. I'm on it. The torpedoes are at 12,000 kilometers. They are closing rapidly. Lock on. Radar lock is at 33.5 minutes, azimuth 50 degrees. All stations, prepare for impact! - All stations, prepare for impact! The torpedoes are on a collision course with New York, San Francisco and Tokyo! This is a Tokyo Defense Alert! This is a Tokyo Defense Alert! The mother ship is approaching Japan with an escort of several fighters. Tokyo is now in a state of alert! Tokyo is now in a state of alert! We have destroyed most of their fleet. All that is left is a small group of saucers and the mother ship. We will finish off the saucers. Give us their coordinates. Currently, one is south of the Science Center at 80 degrees. Itís closing rapidly. - Tower 3! - Right! Fire! The shots have missed their targets! The saucers are altering course for your location now! The mother ship is moving within 2000 meters of your position! Continue observing the situation. Katsumiya! - Tower 3! - Right! Fire! - Tower 2! - Right! Fire! Are there any more? The radars show no signs of activity. Our rocket squadrons are reporting all clear. Papa! Papa, how many of the enemy were there? You can read all about it in the newspapers. Goodbye, Commander. Cancel the alert. - Yes, sir. I'll cancel the alert. All stations, cancel the alert! Katsumiya, come with me to welcome the rocket pilots. - Yes, sir! THE END
