Rolex? Fake fucking Rolex, by the way! Hey! Hey! Amigo! Wait. Hey! Hey! Amigo, untie me! Untie me, please. I've pissed off the Shoemaker enough already. Yeah, no shit? I know who you are. You work for her, right? I also work for her, man. She hates me too, yeah. I lost her dog. What did you do? Yeah, a little bit more than that. Uh... So... where are we going? America? - We? - Yeah. I got family in Texas, Florida, Des Moines... I was thinking about California. California! Yeah. I love California. Look, mate... - Lupe. My name is Lupe, yeah. - Lupe. I'm sure you'd say anything to come with me right now, but I just... Yeah, you're right about that. I sure will. What's your name? I haven't thought of the new one yet. - Huh? - I'm just done. I'm gonna get away from all this violence. Starting... now? Yeah, now's good. Good. Good choice, I... I like that. You and I, buddy, we're gonna be great friends. You know that, right? Man, I see it, just... Sunday morning, you know, mimosas for brunch, you and I driving down PCH in a convertible red Mustang. We're gonna kill it! My client, this noble man before you, was burglarized nearly three months ago. And your office has only paid a fraction of the damages incurred. There's no way I'm gonna take a loss. Tires. My client makes an honest living selling tires, and your offices won't promptly step up and replace his damages. I ain't gonna take a loss. We're drawing up a massive suit against Sackman/Burns. If I were you, I'd be terrified. That's depressing. Didn't steal enough. - Ray... - Okay. You know the saying, "If you owe the bank $100, it's your problem. But you owe the bank $100 million, it's the bank's problem"? Well, if you're gonna steal, steal big. If you're gonna gamble, gamble big. Petty shit never gets you anywhere. Okay, uh, well, thanks for that. I'll be drafting a letter today. We'll pay the claim... if you can answer me just this one question. Now, we agree that this window is the sole entry and exit point of the burglars? Have I been talking to myself this whole time? No, no, no. It's just that... even a Mini Cooper's tire is a whole lot wider than that. Mr. Lopez, I believe you. Somebody broke into your garage, stole your property, but you might wanna go over your claim again. Seems there's some items on the list that have been previously sold, misplaced, or overlooked and... there ain't no way we're taking the loss. Well, all right. Whoa! That actually got me. All right, muscles. You get some sleep. - All right? - All right. - See you in a sec. - See you. Time is running out for our Crane Guys. There's no way. There's no way we can lift this thing! - I don't know if they're gonna be able to lift this. - They always lift it. Yeah, but, babe, this time they've only got 15 minutes. Or what happens? - You're so smart. - I know. Told you. - Do I get a cookie? - Yeah. Of course you get a cookie. - So good. - Yeah, these are the best part about meeting me. - You have the best snacks. - Yep. - What? - You wanna sneak out to my place? I can't. I have to watch Julian. Well, that's the beauty of my place. Okay, let's go. Wow, really... Just such class. I never dreamed I'd be dating a guy who lived in a mobile home. Mobile homes are prefabricated houses and this baby is a motor home. Oh! Or actually a recreational vehicle, since it was built after 1976. - It was? Huh! - Mmm. No, no, no, no. On account of that stuff being gross. I mean, how can you eat that stuff? Because it's delicious and familiar. Miss it if I stopped. Right, well, I understand that. I'm gonna get Julian hooked on it, though. You know Julian loves you. And you're a hard guy to get to really know. You know me. It's been a year. Sixteen months. A great 16 months. It's just, Julian's starting to see us as... a family. And so I'm wondering... are we? I mean, do you even want a family? Yeah. Yeah, of course, one day. Well, if you wanted to move in, that'd be great. If you wanted to move on, I would be fine. A little wrecked, but I'd make it. But I just can't break his little heart. I do want a family. Seriously. Two kids. You know, boy and a girl. Well, that little guy would get you halfway there. Man, the tire guy? That was crazy. I am definitely mentioning that in my college classes. Yeah. How do you always get in their head like that? It's... It's crazy. It's almost like you think like a criminal. Dude, your talents are wasted here. I mean, you would kill it in a poker tournament. I gave up gambling. Oh. Well, chess! I'm more of a checkers man. There are checkers men? - All right, well, reminds me. - Pretty sure. I do have to get you to sign my course hours. - Your course hours. - Yeah. - All right! - All right. Course hours. - Hello? - Hey, it's me. Lupe. What's up, buddy? You still getting out next week? I'm not gonna make it that long, man, okay? I just found out I got spotted in here months ago. Um... They waited to tell me, and for them, it paid off. Paid off? How? They've seen you visit, Ray. Well, did they follow me home? Well, not them, because they're in here with me, but the people on the outside, yeah, probably. Look, I don't think the Shoemaker's been told yet. Why wouldn't she have been told? There's a price on both of our heads, Lupe. And I don't need your bullshit optimism right now. Look, look. The spotter's boss is someone local. Hmm? I just think they want something in exchange for not ratting us out. If this gets back down to her, if she finds out, then anybody around us could be... Dead. Yes, I know. It's gonna be okay. Just give me some time and I'll figure out what they want. Look, I'm sorry, man. Probably wishing you left me in the desert, huh? Okay. Well, gotta go. Bye. Fuck! Hey, how are you? You must be Ray, yeah. Name's Perry, I work for Grayson. Heard of him? He, um... he wants you at this address. Now. So, uh... if I were you... I'd get there. I want my fucking money! Get that? I want my fucking money! Hey! See all this? My idea. I told my brother, if you ever wanna look like you're losing a lot of money, buy a newspaper. You like that, huh? Yeah, me too. I got it at an art fair where they were hawking turquoise and pottery. Artist was selling it for a couple of hundred dollars. I said, "Kid, I'll give you $10,000 for it." And he looks at me. And I said, "The only caveat is I get first dibs on everything you create from here on out." Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking a guy like me, bringing art into the world. But you gotta remember. The Medicis were criminals, crooks. And without them, you never would've had a Renaissance. Wow, well, that's a really cool story... Stop it with the fake American, okay? I know who you are. I know your name. Of course, your reputation precedes you. The Shoemaker was very secretive, good at hiding things. It's a good thing she wasn't very savvy at finding things, because you'd be dead, am I right? If this is a case of mistaken identity, I can check with her. I got her number up here. Fine. What's your price? Thank you. My price is you work for me. I'm done with that shit. - Really? - Really. No kidding! Me too! After today, I'm pivoting. Gonna tie up some loose ends. The thing is... I've intercepted a package going to the Shoemaker. It was too important for me to pass up. It means everything. It's the world, and it's gonna be here in a couple of hours. Now, if the Shoemaker comes after me, I want you close. I can't trust those knuckle-draggers over there. You know what I mean? They're not clever like you. All right. First job, my other place. I have a neighbor. He won't cut his tree. Now I've given him a chance, but I'm through talking. Thank you. You have tools? I have a new drill, but I don't like lending it out. Poison. Drill? You make a little hole, jam in the poison. Wait, you're blackmailing me to kill a tree? Yeah. What, you think I want you to poison my neighbor? Right? Hard no. Yeah. Okay, I thought you'd say that. Brando, give me your phone, will you? Okay, I wanna show you something that took place just a little while ago. Stop... Please, please... Aw, Jesus. I must have pressed the wrong button. But I think you get the point, right? Weirdest thing to me? How guys have phones in there. But it won't be close to what the Shoemaker does to him or you or your loved ones. The woman, Faith, her kid. Ooh. What's this? Is this when we get to see the old Ray I heard so much about? No, but he's fucking knocking. All right, all right. Break it up, you two. We're on the same team now. I don't see what the problem is here. You're gonna be safe with me. I take care of my own. I'll take care of you. You must really hate this tree. You're gonna be fun to have around. Good! Good, good, good! All right. First things first. Take care of the tree. Herbicide, it's called. Do your fucking pickup! Ray, the tree can wait. Fucking idiot Perry dumped his bike on the way to the pickup. Fucking... Fucking dumped his bike. Forget the tree, just... Subtle. Likewise. 440 grand in here. I don't have to tell you what my brother will have me do if you run off on us. How's Lupe? Your buddy's in the infirmary. He'll pull through. - Get him a message. - You really testing me right now? You run errands for us, not the other way. Tell him I'm glad I didn't leave him. That is as cryptic as hell, but sure. Fuck it! I'll pass it on! Guy's name is Ninni. It's a public place. It's called East Jesus. Museum, there's some old junk. Don't worry. You'll fit right in. Would you rather we start over? Okay. All right. Not yet. Fuck. Isn't ketchup water the worst? Mmm. Yeah. You know what I think about when I eat chicken? I think how this used to be a T. rex. Millions of years ago, this guy's ancestor was the most fearsome thing to ever walk on land. Then catastrophe hits. And they had to shrink down, evolve to this miserable little creature, so weak that its very name means "coward." Ah. Yeah, I see what you did there. That was... That was very clever, yeah. Now we're gonna make this exchange, or I'm just gonna fucking take it from you. You do have some balls. You wanna find out? Excuse me, boys! Do you guys mind moving out of the way, maybe somewhere over there? Please? Thanks. All right, how's my hair? Do we... Do you wanna grab yours and I'll grab mine? Grayson won't even tell his own brother what that is. But Grayson loves a deal, so it must be something big, bigger than the 440 he's paying for it. You got a guess? You know, I've evolved to be less curious. I ain't done. Yeah, you are. Oh. - Hey, babe! - Hey. Tried you at work. Yeah, I'm... I'm not there. I know. I can hear you driving. So, where are you driving off to in the middle of a Tuesday, Ray? You know, nowhere much. Just... nowhere much. Something came up, but I'm working on it. Are you running, Ray? I gotta call you back, okay? Think I just got a flat tire. Yeah. Throw it in the Jeep! It goes under the road! Go back up! Oh, man! Okay, okay... Come on, come on, come on, come on. A little bit further. Come on, mate. Come on, mate. Okay. Okay. Okay. What an idiot. Ray? Woman I've been chasing. Well, you know what they say. Man chases a woman until she catches him. Hey, baby. It's bad. - How bad? - He got away. He what? With the money or the pickup? - Both. - Both? Yeah, both days are good. What the fuck? Unlike Perry, this guy really knows how to handle himself. You were supposed to be able to handle yourself. You and your brother need to make Ray disappear. My brother's dead. Shit! Well, that makes things a little harder. I have never seen my brother as excited about anything as he is about this. Must be a fortune. I think I've figured out which way this asshole went. You better. Otherwise, we're both fucked. - Both of us? - Yeah, Ninni. Handle this. Or he's gonna slit both of our throats. Come on! Enough already! Yeah, baby, I gotta go. Fuck. - All right, come on. Let's go. - Where are we going? Ray's house. Just in case he gets any ideas about running away. Oh, Yes! Fuck yes! No fucking handles. - Do you have a gun? - No! No, I'm just trying to buy this car. It's beautiful. What is it, '78? - It's not mine to sell. - Okay. Do you have a car? Well, you're not picky. I'll also pay you to use a phone. No, I don't have a phone. But I got a radio. It's for the police. Here, you wanna call 'em? Oh... What happened? I was cleaning my shotgun and... Wait. I thought you said you didn't have a gun. Oh, no. I don't have a gun here. I don't have a gun here. Look... I'd like to invite you in, but... you seem like a certain type. Little rough. No nonsense? I'm not rough. Some nonsense, but... Come on. Oh, hey, stay away from that area. It's falling apart. It's okay, mate. - I don't wanna know. - What? I'm just saying I don't care what you do out here. I'm sure lots of people around these parts cook, you know, stuff. I don't judge. You mean meth? Oh! No, that's not my thing. - No, I say no to drugs. - Me too. I'm a beer guy. - Beer, yeah. - Hey, come on. I'll show you my man cave. Yeah. Boom! Here's my man cave! Wow. So you live here? Yeah. Just for now, yeah. Why? Where do you live? An old RV. - What? Really? - Yeah. You know what really bugs me? It's when people call 'em "motor homes" instead of "recreational vehicles." - Yes. Yes! - But what's even worse is when older people call them all... - Winnebagos! - Winnebagos! Yeah. Hey, my buds call me Billings. I'm Ray. Oh, yeah, part of the job description is killing pests. Shoot 'em, blow up any gopher holes. This right here is called varmint killer. - You... You good there, mate? - Yeah, yeah. It's just I'm out here in the middle of nowhere using words like "varmint" like I'm Yosemite Sam. Well... Hmm! You know, I thought I was headed towards a better life myself, but... Well, delivery driver's due this afternoon. Maybe they can take you to the next town. - That or a phone. - Hey. Hey. I'm telling you, bro, that shit's gotta come out. My grandmammy told me that the toughest asshole can be taken down by the tiniest piece of metal. It's hospital or me. You choose. All right. Yeah, come on! Do-si-do. Here's my partner. Hey, watch my collectibles. This is Ray's life? That's depressing. I hate it when good things happen to bad people. World's gone nuts. So, if he has skipped town on us, what do you wanna do? Well, the ancient Romans used to take a guy, put him in a sack with a dog, a snake, and a monkey. And just dump 'em in the river. But we don't have any of those things. Not Ray. Hey, baby! There were some tracks. They're gone now. Sending you a map of my location. Can't be far. Okay, baby. I gotta go, though. You sure you don't want any anesthesia? - I really recommend it. - No, I can't. I have to stay conscious, get back. You have... You have an RV. Where do you have to get back to? I got a tree to poison. It's a long story. I knew I should have done this myself. I can't trust anybody else. All right. We'll come back for the broad later. Okay, Perry, drive. Salton Sea. I'll handle it. You stay here. I'm sorry, what? What did you say, little brother? You'll handle it? What, you running things now? I said I'll handle it. - It's too valuable. - Well, how much is it? Fuck the money. It's the package. Well, what's in the package? You'll see. Along with the rest of the world. Yeah, that's good. That's good. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Seems like you would know. Those other wounds. Where'd they come from? I'd rather forget. I hear you. A few years ago, I fell off a ladder putting up the Christmas lights and I... I broke the nerves in this hand. I can... I can barely feel this hand. Except for some nights... you won't believe this, it itches. Hmm. Okay, okay. - Go slow, go slow. - Yeah, yeah. - So, what do I owe you for the patch? - No, nothing. Nothing. Mm-mmm. I don't like to owe. Let me buy the 'Vette. - I'll give you 20 grand for it. - I told you. It's not mine to sell. You're killing me, Billings. Come on. Well, the patch may have been free, but for the bottle. Take it. Rest a bit. You rest. East Jesus is not so far. We should get back to the car. I wanted to see this. You know this lake was made by accident? Dam broke, filled it with water. When I was a kid, this was a huge tourist destination. Now, look at it. It's poison. It stinks. It's rotten. It's depressing. Nothing to be done. It's the way of things. Call it what you want, entropy, whatever. Our world is decaying right before our eyes, aging, dying. It's going so fast, we don't even notice it. I noticed it's getting worse out there. Everybody's at each other's throats. That's different, okay? That's not our fault. - That's 'cause of something that happened ten years ago. - Like what? All right, I'm gonna tell you something that I haven't told anybody, okay? This is really important to me. You ever hear of the Mandela Effect? - You're gonna tell me anyway, so... - Shut up, asshole. Just listen. It's named after the fact that millions upon millions of people swear that Nelson Mandela passed away in prison in the 1980s. So there's a discrepancy between historical record and what people remember. And there are countless examples of it, especially in popular culture, okay? Um, um, um... Darth Vader never said, "Luke, I am your father," okay? Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs never said, "Hello, Clarice." The Monopoly Man, okay? The Monopoly Man never wore a monocle. - An eyepiece. Yeah, he did... - Yeah, yeah. No, he didn't. The theory is, ten years ago, we split into a parallel universe, a darker one. Franky, what the fuck are you talking about? No, no, no! I'm not alone on this, okay? The effect explains why society is acting so crazy, why it's become so divisive, okay? Multiverses or time travelers or powers beyond our control are making us act this way. It's not our fault! We're being manipulated! People think that it's hackers or that it's propaganda... - Son of a bitch. - ...and it's not. - I know! - I could've sworn - he was wearing an eyepiece! - Okay, here's one! And I swear to God this is true! You remember the comedian Sinbad, right? Okay, Sinbad made a movie about a genie. Now I saw this movie! Do you understand me? Now people are saying it was never made, but I'm telling you I saw it! I can see it in my mind's eye! I can see it at the video store on the shelf! - I believe you, boss. - Will you shut up? Shut up! I'm talking to my fucking brother! Get out of here! Get out of here! Jesus! Goddamn it! Listen, you've no doubt noticed that I got a lot going on, right? And I want you to know that I appreciate everything you're doing, the way that you're handling everything you're handling. You've been a real partner. You've been a brother. In a couple of days, this will all be over, and we'll talk. Come on. Let's go. Hey, I think you locked the door. Billings! I asked you to rest. Is that why you locked me in? I can't be letting you leave just quite yet now, can I? Wait a minute. Your accent just changed. Your whole thing just changed. Well, you show up shot, $20,000 on you. Gotta be more to this story. Okay, well, how's this? Story's over, and you just made yourself 20 grand. Sound good? Where there's 20 grand, I'll wager there is more. Lots more. You played me. You waited till I dropped my guard, and you played me. I been waiting too long, son. Waiting my whole fucking life. You know, they lie to you. They tell you, if you just hang in there, the world's gonna give you your break, your turn. But it doesn't. You gotta take everything you can get, so here I am. Taking. Well, before you take from me, just know that people have killed for that money. I've killed for that money. Wait here. No! Open the fucking door, Billings! Billings! Fuck! Okay... Fuck! Okay. Drink up, bitch. Okay. Okay, okay. Another fucking lock. Okay. Ray, you should know that I'm armed. All right. I'm coming in, Ray. I keep some traps out here, Ray, but you know that now 'cause you don't need your legs to show me where the money's at, Ray. You thought we were playing checkers, I was playing chess. I'm really fucking good at checkers! Bags. Where? - We gotta go. - Sure, I'm gonna send you. But first, where are the bags? Look, you know I've gotta bring Grayson the pickup, but... I'll give you the rest of the cash, and let's call it even. We ain't yet even for my brother. Both bags. Where? There. Look! It's there? Well, let me just turn around. Yes! Turn the fuck around! Oh! Cutting me out of negotiations? You wanna make a deal? Try to cut me out? I'm shooting to wound, Ray. Trying to. One way in, one way out of there! Hello? Hello? This is Dr. Topaz. Dr. To... I'm sorry, do I... Is Ray there? I'm afraid to tell you that Ray was in an accident. It involved a recreational vehicle. I-Is he all right? Sir, I'm his... I'm his girlfriend. I'm Faith Dryer. Well, Ms. Dryer, he wouldn't be in a hospital - if he were all right. - Fuck, fuck, fuck. No. No, Faith, no! He's limping along. Okay, well, we're at the end of a dirt road. How stat can you be here? Um... two hours. I just... I have to get a sitter. Okay. See you soon, Ms. Dryer. Be quick, but don't hurry. Okay. Two hours, she's gonna drive right to me. Unless you wanna tell me where the money and this pickup bag is. I can give you the rest of the cash. Another 420 grand! Whoo! Now we're cooking with gas! And what of this talk of your pickup? - I can't give you the pickup! - You can't? If I don't go back with the pickup, then my li... my family's life... it won't be worth a thing. Well, your life isn't worth much right now. I'm sorry. That sounded cynical. So we making a deal or what? - Tell me where it is. - I'll go get it. Hmm. Because the cash and this other bag are in the same spot, huh? And I gotta guess, whatever it is, it's worth about the same as the money, right? It was a trade, correct? Just give me ten minutes to go get it. I can trust you and maybe get half the wealth. Or I could torture you and get it all. Hmm, I think I'll go with B, torture, all. It's a matter of time, Ray! Got you, motherfucker. - Ugh! - I see it now, the Yosemite Sam resemblance, uncanny. - You fucking poisoned me? - Maybe. Gambling it works on people, but... You're dead! I'm not sure you got the time, bud! I'll fucking kill you, man! You're dead! I'll fucking kill you and your girl! Okay. Where's the gun? Goddamn it, Ray! Oh, my God. Are you okay... Fuck! Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? Sure, you will. You're here to take me. Take you? No, I want out of here too. Ray! He's looking for me. Okay. The name's Ray. What's yours? What are we, friends? Common enemy? Yeah, he did that to you? Some of it. Look. I got a woman and her kid waiting for me. The thought of not seeing them again hurts more than any of this. So you'd better believe I'm getting out of this hell hole and back to them. Okay? Okay. Tara, I've... I've been here five days, I think. Um... He grabbed me off the road. What, were you running away from home? I never really had a home to run away from. Well, you know, you shouldn't hitchhike. I didn't. Good, because... you shouldn't. - Maybe you're about done? - Yeah. Ah, shit! I think that's for me. He said that he's expecting a truck to come, but I don't know where it's going. Doesn't matter. 'Cause you ain't never getting on it, all right? Come on, come on... - Any problems? - Not a one! - You're early. - Yeah, by, like, two minutes. That's right. That's okay. You just wait right here. I'll go get her. No, I'd like to see what I'm picking up before I pick it up. No problem. You're the expert. Come on. Come on in. Please don't leave me. I'm not gonna leave you, because we're both getting out of here. But, first... first, I gotta leave you. No! Shh. Trust me. Ah. There she is. Are you okay? I'm not gonna hurt you. - Okay? - How much is she worth? Well, I'm not gonna inspect her teeth. It's okay. Bring her upstairs. Come on. Come on. When you load her, lock her up. And hurry up. I got a long drive. Yes, ma'am. Wait, wait. You hear something? Get the fuck back! Get the fuck back! You okay? Don't scream. Why did you cover my mouth? I thought that would work. I'm sorry. - Look. - They'll find us by the car. And they'll find us in the desert. We need to double back for the car. And then I'm gonna take you anywhere you wanna go. Name it. I've been squatting over in Slab City. I should be okay there. Well, we'll worry about that later. Can you run? - Can you run? - No. But I am gonna hobble like hell. Wait. Not just yet. I should have told you about him. Very unprofessional of me. But don't worry. Neither of them can get too far. I can fix this. Yeah. You've done a bang-up job so far. Hey, they're definitely in here. Lot of reasons to be careful. Look at my face. This was supposed to be fucking simple. I wanna get the fuck out of here. Wait. There's blood. Just follow my lead. Come here. Okay, three... No! Two, one. What is this doing here? He must have moved it. I keep some traps around for protection. Oh, my God. Help me. Can you help me right now? Shh, shh, shh. Hello? - Doctor here. - Dr. Topaz? - Help me! - Speaking. Hi. It's Faith Dryer. I'm calling about... Ray, yes, yes. Well, it's a pleasure to hear from you again, Ms. Dryer. Sorry, what was that in the background? - Oh, my God! - Hold one moment, please? Oh, my God. Help me, fucking idiot. I'm back. - Can you hear me now? - Yes, thank you. How's Ray? I have to admit, he's doing much better than I expected. The guy won't quit. Do you have your ETA? Uh, we are about... - 30 minutes away. - We? Yeah, my son. I couldn't get a sitter. No problem whatsoever. I'll tell you what. I will send a security guard to meet you. He's a burly man with a beard. Okay, thank you. - You good? - Okay, yeah, yeah. Go! Oh! Fuck this. Stand back. No, no, no, no! Remote shut-off. Shit! Shit! He told me this wasn't his car! Go! Just run! Just run! Go, go! Go, Tara. Go, go, go, go, go! Run! Run! Run, Tara, run! No! Still got it. I don't feel like fighting you. Best believe I feel like killing you! Fuck! For the love of God, Montresor! You gotta start thinking about your woman. Think about Faith. Oh... And that kid that's with her. Yeah, son. They'll both be here in, say, 20 minutes? Faith's smart! She's not gonna just walk into your place! You mean like you did? Yeah, I mean, you're probably right. That's why I'm gonna meet her at the access road. I'm sorry, meet "them" at the access road. If I tell you where the bags are... - When you tell me where the bags are. - ...will you let 'em go? Will you trust my answer? I can be less cynical. I probably don't even have time to kill 'em. All this death here, people are gonna come looking. I need a head start. This money gets me far and away. Rusted car husk at the speedway. I put it under the hood. Yeah! $440,000? 420 now. You already got 20. All right, then. Fuck! Action time. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. - Door's coming off! - Oh, shit! Check and mate. Any last words? I... Good enough. Well, there's gotta be a story here. I'm the victim here! I'm just disappointed is all. I heard so many clever things about you, Ray. But I guess I get the backstabbing murder side of the old habits, don't I? I already told you. He killed them. He was trying to steal the money, the pickup. Unless you and the twins always planned on double-crossing us. Split it with this asshole here until greed got the better of you? I'm just an innocent bystander. This stranger, he just came in, and he was trying to threaten me, and I was just... All right. I'm sorry, sir. I'm just gonna cut the shit and level with you. The sharp dresser is mostly right. Me and Ray go way back. He called me, and he said he needed a place to stash, and I quote, "440,000 buckaroonies." But then he killed that man, and since then, I've just been trying to survive. Oh, I'm sorry. I started to tune out at "buckaroonies." You know, before you get too chummy with this fucking guy, you should know that he is a dirty, murdering, fucking child trafficker! If you survive this, we'll talk. Oh, so you're a piece of shit too. The world changed. It's under the hood. Really? Go look. Well, I expected more out of you. You worked for the Shoemaker. Thought you'd learn how to hide money and things. Maybe some of it would've rubbed off on you. Yeah, well, I'm sorry to disappoint. Frankie, the package! Give it, here. Here, here. - Where's the cash? - You have it. - I don't have it. - Yes, you do. - I don't have it! - Yes, you do! - You have it! - Shut up, both of you! First things first! Gorgeous. - That's it? - This is it! Really? Fucking move. Yes, yes... Yes! Yeah. This is it! This proves it! The Mandela Effect is real! It's real? The world has changed, and it's not our fault. You're all witnesses to it. I give this gift... to all mankind. Get the VCR. Yeah, I've seen this. This is... This is Kazaam. You actually bought four copies of Kazaam. - Shazaam. - No, Kazaam. Kazaam. They're both genie movies. But this one is the Shaquille O'Neal vehicle. - It's Shazaam. - That's a good Photoshop, though. Why does she want this? What the hell? $440,000 for this? Yo soy Kazaam! Oh, she got you. What a waste of 440,000 buckaroonies. But Shaq's really grounded in this scene. He's so much better than LeBron. - Plus, he's got all these commercials... - Shut up. It's just depressing is all. I thought this would prove it. Why is the world so crazy? I mean, it's poisoned. It's... toxic. And there's nothing to be done. Fucking sucks. I guess it's on us. I mean, it'd be easier if we can blame the universe changing or time travelers. But maybe everything right now is our own damn fault. Just shut the fuck up. Get behind the wheel or I'll put you behind the car. Get out of here. Hey! What was that for? All right. Tapes are gone. They're worthless. Might as well get my money back. - Where is it? - I'll tell you what happened. Your brother double-crossed you. He and the twins were gonna steal everything and kill Perry, - but I got sent instead. - Bullshit. Frankie, the guy's a professional liar. All they had to do was make it look like I'd run off. There was a time that would have been easier. All I did was run. Even if it was true, which it isn't, he'd still know where the money is, right? Where's the money? It's in that car, last I saw it. Oh, shit! All right. I'm calling the Shoemaker. Maybe your death will be a peace offering, you and your friend in prison. The only person I told is Billings. Hey! Don't you put that on me, bro! I'd be long gone if I had the money! Oh, Shit. You stand, you die. Somebody wants to talk to you. What's the matter, Ray? You don't wanna talk? All right. On my signal, take him around again. Only twice as long and twice as fast. She must have overheard me and Ray! Beat us to it! She's got the cash! Chase her down! Is that true? She's got the cash? Your brother... asked when you were gonna see the old me. Yeah. You said you were knocking. Well, I'm waiting. I let him in. What? Perry! Perry! Perry, stop! - Perry, wait! - Fucker. Oh, f... Okay. Oh, geez. No. No, no, no, no, no... I'm gonna borrow these firearms. Can never have enough. Tara! I'm fine! Find a damn gun! Okay. Great. More running. One shot. Can you make your one shot count? You're a mess, Ray! In a few steps... I will be in range and one of these pistols will kill you! Believe that. Oh... Okay. Okay. Okay, I always like a good Western. High Noon, Shane. Cowboy Bebop? I never saw you as the anime type. You never asked. I gotta call range! Check and mate... You... You... Billings! Billings, stop! Stop! Ray... You're not Yosemite Sam. Just grazed me! You're Wile E. Coyote. Check and mate. Oh, what a fucking day. What? Shit! Hello? Faith! Are you okay? Ray! Are you okay? I am now. But it's best if you and Julian just turn around, okay? Get out of here. I'm... But I'm right here. And I want to be with you more than anything. But trust me. I will explain everything when I see you in a few hours. Everything. Even the things that I wanted to forget. Echoes from my past. I'm so sorry. Sorry that even a whisper of them came close to you and Julian. But I'll never let that happen again. It's all behind me. Hey, remember when you said, with Julian, I was halfway there? Yeah. I think I just picked up the other half. A kid I found. She needs what I need. She needs it just as much as I do. What is it that you need? I just need... to get... home. Just like you thought. Shoemaker always was good at hiding things. We should get rid of this. It's nothing but trouble. That's not me anymore.
