[female reporter] Police are still searching for 21 year-old college student Heather Price. Reported missing three days ago, after leaving a friend's house in Mill's Falls. At the time of her disappearance, Price was wearing a striped sweater, dark blue jeans, and sneakers. Anyone who may have... [static hissing] [screaming] [panting] - [knife unsheathes] - [phone camera beeps] [typing on keyboard] [ambient sounds] [woman] The time is now. - [static hums] - [feedback] [woman] Kill Kristy. [♪ rock music] Kristy is follower of Christ. You kill Kristy, you kill God. Kristy's pretty... ...pure... ...blessed. Find them. Hunt them. - Know their fear. - [car door shuts] [screams] [rock music continues] [distorted screams] - [electronic beep] - [camera shutter clicks] [woman] Show your work. [typing on keyboard] [woman] More will follow. They are weak. They... are... Kristy.

Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, eternity in an hour. - A robin red breast in a cage... - [man laughs] ...that's..." You're so immature. I'm laughing because you sound so bored. I'm not bored, I just... I don't get how to break it down. It's poetry, you nerd, not math. Did you just call me a nerd? Yeah. It's not an equation. It's an experience. As far as poets go, Blake's pretty much a badass. You just need to... embrace it a little more. We're not all future novelists. Future novelist? I like that. OK, well, I can't get a "B" in this class because I have to keep my academic scholarship. It'll be fine. I'll help you through it. No, you have to get a head start, remember? Oh. Come on. - You're the one who opted out. - Aaron, it's fine. I got laid, you can go. Hell, bring Nicole if you want. It's silly that you guys are staying here. You think a long weekend of girl time is silly? Actually, it's kinda hot. It is and you're gonna miss it all. Get off the bed. - I don't think so. - [screams playfully] [laughing] [low-tempo music] [man] Heisenberg was all about unforeseen outcome. Light bending. Sodium nitrate exploding with water. Boom. That sounds like an unexpected outcome to me, yes? Yeah, I know, Mom. We talked about this. The flights were so expensive. Well, they always jack it up for Thanksgiving. I said they jack it up. No, I'll be fine till Christmas. You have Tammy and the baby. [man] Want these lights on, Justine? Oh, uh, no. You can turn them off. I'm almost done. Just come. She won't bother you, I swear. Aaron, don't you remember the Fourth of July when she asked me how my dishwashing program was going? She doesn't get work study. Well, does she understand some people have to work for a living? Jus, stop. I swear to God you can be so stubborn. Just tell me what you want. I want you to stay. With me. This one time. You know my family. I have to go home. Einstein saw order in the universe. And believed that nothing happens by chance, whereas Heisenberg believed that the world was inherently chaotic. More random. [sniffles] - I miss you guys too. - [dog barking] Hey, Jus. [Justine] Oh, it's just Scott, the groundskeeper. [sniffling] Don't work too hard, huh? OK. Have a happy Thanksgiving. You too, Greg. I think the Einstein quote was: "God does not play dice with the universe." And in Heisenberg's world, God does roll the dice. - Say it. - Say what? You know what. [recorder beeps] You can't corner me with technology. [laughs] - Say it. - Aaron, come on. I love you. I love you, Justine. [turns recorder off] Be safe. Bye. Go. Bye. [engine starts] [low-tempo music] [electricity zaps] - Hey, Wayne. How you doing? - It's my stay-behinds. Doing my laundry before I hit the books. [Wayne chuckles] [TV on, muffled] [door closes] [electricity humming] [faint thudding] - [both scream] - I am so sorry. - Are you OK? - Oh, yeah. No, it's just this basement. So, are these gonna do this all weekend? Yeah, that's what I heard. - Crud. - [electricity powers up loudly] - Oh, well, there you go. - Whew. - So, do you have room for one more? - [laughs] Thanks. And don't forget the Red Vines. - No, that's just a given. - Bye. [female reporter] ...smashed, and there was blood on the tires. - [coins clatter in vending machine] - Investigators say personal items were found in several dumpsters. While the police are canvassing the area... [food drops in machine] [reporter continues, indistinct] Hi, Anna. Are you going back to London? No, just France upstate. You and Nicole really staying behind? Yeah. Our turkey pot pie awaits. - Da svidaniya. - Happy Thanksgiving. - [door opens] - [Nicole on phone, indistinct] - Dad, I know. - [door closes] Yeah, I'll be cool if she's cool. OK, I'll see you soon. Love. - No. - Please don't kill me. My dad is back. He surprised the family. He wants to spend the holiday in Aspen. - [Justine] OK. - The car's on its way. Come with me. I'll get another plane ticket. You can't stay here all by yourself. Jus. It's OK. I'm fine. Really. I am so sorry. I swear I wanted to hang out with you. It's just my dad's taking a break from the campaign, and the whole family's gonna be together. And it's, like, Aspen... Nicole, I understand. It's fine. Family's family. And promise me you will get off this campus. Get some fresh air somewhere away. - [Justine chuckles] - Here. - Take my baby. - I don't even want to breathe on your bimmer. Oh, please. Use it. You know you want to. Thanks. Oh, come here. You be safe, OK? OK. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. - OK. - Bye. Hey, last chance. Oh! Thanks. Bye. See you after Thanksgiving. Thanks for the bimmer! [male DJ] Good morning and happy Thanksgiving from everyone here at 106.5. [male DJ 2] That's right, and hopefully everyone is spending it with their family and friends. What do you think, Jimbo? [Jimbo] Oh, man. It is a beautiful morning. - Perfect for Thanksgiving. - [DJ 2] But actually, we are in for some rain later this evening. Just about the time everyone should be slipping into their food comas. [Jimbo] They're not gonna care, they'll be in a food coma. [DJ 2] Yeah, they'll be asking, "Let it rain. Let it rain. Let it rain."
