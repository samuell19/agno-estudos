Our objective is a reconstruction of the events on the 17th and 19th of September 2000 in the exhibition rooms of the National Museum. Taking part are: Inspector Mazurczak, of the forensic laboratories of Poznan police, who operates a Panasonic video camera M-50, and the witness Lucyna Kazimierczak Kazimierowska... - Kazimierowska... I'm sorry. The participants have been warned that the procedure will be recorded on a Panasonic E-120 tape. Emotions... quite strong. I'm coming back to that. I don’t know if I’d prefer to keep this officialor nonofficial version. I don't know, really. Or, if I’d prefer to keep what is commonly known... I don't know what I prefer. So here I have quite a serious dilemma in my life. Expressing this is even harder for me because I've never shared it with anyone before. I wish that people who might watch it one day can judge what I’ve done in September 2000, 17 years ago. I remember this day. There was heavy rain. I told myself: "That's a good sign." I said: "Dear God, please give me strength." I looked in the mirror... What now, old man? The time has come and you have to do it. Nobody will do it instead, you're alone. Can you tell me exactly what you were doing on 17 September, on Sunday? From 11:00 everything went on normally. As usual? - As usual. Yes There was not so much traffic. And... around 12:30, a man came who... Did this man introduce himself? No, he only said that he would like to sketch a landscape which hangs in... - In the neighbouring room? Under your care, right? - Yes. Let's go there. And he asked for a chair. He asked if he could have a chair. That's the painting. Can you read what's written? - 'Landscape with Cattle' How did I come up with the idea? To make that replica of the landscape, by the Dutch painter? Because it was next to the 'Beach'. The idea was I would pretend I was focusing on the painting next to the 'Beach', Monet. Did you ask this man if he had a permit to make a sketch? Yes: 'Do you have a permit?' He said he wanted to sketch. He said he had a permit from the manager, that everything was sorted. But he had very little time. To the National Museum in Poznan. In order to search for new themes, artistic impressions and because I'm currently trying to become a member of the Association of Polish Fine Art Artists, the branch in Krakow, and because my work will be evaluated by the selection committee, I plead with a polite request to issue a permit to make a sketch on bristol. I must stress that my goal is not to make a copy, but to capture a visual moment and a style that the artist of the selected work, used which will enable my own interpretation of my own painting. Thank you in advance. Sincerely, Jacek Walewski. I took it from the surname, Malczewski, but I have changed a few letters. I didn't even see this permit, to be honest, but it was there. I was just supposed to introduce myself with my fake name. Light turtleneck and short hair. Round face. What else can I say about this man? Nobody really paid attention to people present there The ladies, they do their job in a rather... light-minded way. After he entered he chose this painting, then what? I've allowed that 'Please, take the chair.' I've even carried it. He said thank you, and laid down the bristol then said he’ll be sketching. Please show me, how did you walk, and what was your rhythm? What did guarding this man look like? Where were you standing, where were you walking? There, I had this chair. I sat down for a little. This was the rhythm? Yes, this rhythm. This is how I walk and... I don't run from room to room. All the time I was thinking it is impossible to do. But somewhere inside I felt that my inner strength... Because I was so determined, I told myself: it must work. It must be done because... because it must. They were not working in that particular moment. How did you know? I can't tell. I had nothing to do with it. Just a coincidence. Someone from above was guarding me and thought, just like myself, that it had to be done and that it must succeed. I think the same now. How did he keep his sketchbook? - It was mostly lying flat. I even bent to look a this sketchbook. Closely? - Yes, just before he finished. And what stage was it? Were there any outlines? There were some... meadows. But there was no cattle there. Only a bit of the meadows... yellowish. Maybe you can tell us how he was proceeding? What was his position? Was it like this? Yes, yes... exactly. He was standing like this, painting with a green crayon. Because he also had some crayons here. There was a moment that wasn't very nice One lady was surprised that for 2-3 hours she could only see underlay, some bad drawings... let's say, not very understandable. And at one point she comes and there is a painting, almost finished. So she was surprised and even asked: 'Have you already painted it? A few seconds ago there was nothing.' 'So you must be very fast.' What else... Then I see 'The Beach.' Yes. I'm standing and looking. What do I feel? Nothing. I'm feeling nothing. I'm standing and looking. Nothing happens. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm looking again. I'm looking at the 'Beach'... and nothing, nothing, nothing happens. Nothing that could make me... feel worried in terms of my behaviour. So what now? You look at the 'Beach' and you make friends with it. You don't look at it just as a painting. It's like falling in love. Something like enchantment. Was I waiting for this? I don't know. How long are you standing here before your return? It's hard to say, but maybeeven 15 minutes. I can see this man is still in that room. In fact you're thinking... What are you going to do now? What can you do now? What must you do now? Somewhere in your mind the thought springs up the project of my life... that you must steal the 'Beach'. Because... if you won’t do it... then... then what kind of life is it if you won't do it. I'm looking at the “Beach” all the time. It is as close to me as my family, my children, my wife. I identify with this painting literally. There is no more internal dialogue: 'This is not normal. What are you talking about?' 'What are you even thinking?' I didn't care anymore if it's normal or not. If you haven’t had previous experience of theft then it's hard to know how to do such a difficult thing as stealing a painting from The National Museum. Problem, problem. I think for a professional thief it would be a problem and here it is a megabig problem... So very big problem. The most important thing is, I have to hurry up. Problem, problem. I was living with my parents back then with my mum, my father and my sister. The apartment consisted of two rooms so I had to clean everything in order to make simulation. Coming closer to the wall, going further from it. Doing some similar... movements that I will be doing on the location. I had to count my footsteps I had to walk around the room, to know the measurements. I noted them in my memory. I also knew I had to sit down here, in this very place. I couldn't sit down a few meters further or closer to the entrance because I had to have a good spot to see what I was copying. Can you see him from this place? No, I can't see him but I know he's still there. He can't leave, or move to another place. So there is a possibility that for more than a dozen minutesyou can't see this man? There is a possibility. All right, let's go back to that room in the same rhythm. How are you walking? - Like this. For a moment I was looking for another solution in order not to cut it. Cutting a painting is a last resort Because there is a huge risk of damaging it. Every cut I was making was painful I felt it personally, even literally. I didn't know how much time I had. How long was this man there? - Well... Well... It's hard for me to tell now how long he was there. I was simply checking on him from time to time. When I could hear the lady coming closer to me then I would stop. Like a red light flashing in my head alarm, alarm. After a few cuts, the last move has to be done. So this replica that should go into the frame was hidden between the bristol pages. And the exchange itself... That was a matter of a few seconds. Simply after sticking it with double tape it looked whole. It didn't matter if the replica would be discovered a day, two days or a week later. Most importantly was that it wouldn't be discovered while I was there. When he was leaving, you were in another room? Yes, I was here, but when he left I came back to this room. Did you check the condition of the painting? I looked, but I hadn't noticed anything suspicious. And what about the behaviour of this man? No, He said: 'I'm going, goodbye.' That's it. I can't say anything more. Of course, I said goodbye to everybody. I even said: 'all the best, bye'. All very politely. I wanted it to be elegant. I arrived and put the painting on the table. My parents have a big table there. I unfolded it and for a long time I was looking at it. I felt good, I felt very good. Fantastic. Not only fantastic, wonderful. Why? I was working for French Jews. There was a situation. It was my birthday. I was invited for dinner at their place. When you enter the apartment and the living room where we were supposed to stay, on the walls, there were many paintings. So I ask them 'Are these paintings... I've seen similar paintings in a museum.' 'Are they originals? Are these real paintings?' 'Oh yes.' There was Renoir and Matisse... and Gauguin... and Monet... They asked me during the dinner: 'Why are you interested in this, Robert?' We are approaching... a point... A turning point. When I was working for a certain person, something happened that changed my life. Accidentally, because they trusted me the people I worked for... Somehow I witnessed a conversation from which I could learn there was... a plan to steal and sell a Monet from Poznan. There is a shock: I have knowledge, I know that people who are planning to do it will do it. So there will be a robbery no matter what. What is it about? It's about money. If you don't know what it is about then it's about money. Just business. Shock. What are you going to do now? What can you do now? And what should you do now? The simple solution would be to make a phone call and say that Monet is in danger, because there is a plan. No... I was always looking for strange solutions, I always made my life more complicated. My idea has been conceived. What can you do? You can do what they want to do, simply go and steal this painting. So it's not going to end up in their hands. If it is in their hands, that's the end. Steal this Monet. Steal it, simply steal it. To save it. To rescue it. Because... You simply must do it. You simply must do it, because if you don't ... The police were considering various scenarios of this robbery. We thought the painting might have been stolen for an art collector. A very wealthy person who could afford such a commission. It could have been stolen in order to find a buyer later. The thief could even have destroyed the painting. I knew for a long time already that I was wanted, not only in Poland but in Europe and all around the world. There must come an end at some point I wanted to end it. I stood in front of the main entrance of a police station with my briefcase, with Monet I was standing and didn't know what to do. Long... it felt like an eternity. I came back home started crying, and didn't do anything else. For ten years, the police were acting chaotically They got a tip in France, they would go to France. They got a tip in Spain, they would go to Spain. There were some fake leads. They followed but it was nothing. A false trail. In 2009, I remember this day very well. While checking these traces and comparing them with the fingerprints database we found similar fingerprints to the ones left by the thief on the painting's frame. The same day they found out the fingerprints belonged to someone from Olkusz. Then we quickly connected the dots. We remembered that in 2000 this fake student had sent letters from Olkusz, asking for a permit to copy paintings in that room. Fantastic, what fingerprints? There were no fingers. That was information just for the public. There were no fingers, no fingerprints. The only real lead was the one I had provided them. I was giving signals all the time so they would catch me. Yes. Consequence of this information was my arrest in 2010, January. But the police don't know this version of the story. Even more so, not only the police don't know, nobody knows. Nobody. I don't care if they will believe me or not. This is my story, I'm real. This is my real story. There is no other story. Okay, we are starting the experiment. We are in Olkusz. The goal of this experiment is to discover the place where the stolen painting was kept by Claude Monet 'Beach in Pourville'. The place will be indicated by the suspect Mr. Robert ...Zwolinski. We are going now to the apartment of the parents. To the parent's apartment where Mr Robert Zwolinski is registered. He also told us about watching the famous film: 'The Thomas Crown Affair.' in which the main character steals paintings just to have the man enjoy them. But hard to say how it really was... if this movie was really inspiring for him. My story keeps being sensationalised. Sensational storylines... There are no sensational storylines. These are my inner feelings, my inner struggle. This is not for a thriller movie. The media tried to make me look ridiculous and to show me as a weirdo. Something like that. As a man who is crazy who steals the painting... for love... Literal love. You've testified before that it had a different colour. The original from the one you revealed. I was looking... This is sliding out I touch it... I moved back and took a look at this painting. And I say: 'There is something wrong with the colours.' I didn't notice that before. So I was looking. 'Oh dear.' Was the colour difference noticeable for an ordinary man? The truth is If I didn't make this effort, the 'Beach' wouldn't exist, full stop. The truth is that in our investigations we never have supposed that the painting could have been stolen by someone who fell in love with it. It's not easy. But who said it would be easy and pleasant? I decided to do it not for the money, not for the fame, because I'm not a star. I am not a hero, I am nobody. I'm a simple, ordinary man, an ordinary man. I repeat, an ordinary man who had to make one of the most important decisions in his life because he thought it was his duty. This is how I felt inside and this is how I still feel. This is not my version. or version of the events... This is my story. We restart our experiment after the break to change batteries... Did anything else come to your mind now that wasn't in the testimony? Something you might want to add? Ok, let's finish our procedure. It's 17:56 now. It's not easy. But who said it would be easy and pleasant? This is not my version. This is not my version. or version of the events... This is my story. Again? -Yes. It's not easy. But who said it would be easy and pleasant?
