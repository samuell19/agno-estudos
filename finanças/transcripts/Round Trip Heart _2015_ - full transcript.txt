Pardon me… Restaurant service. It would be a pleasure to take your orders. Bento, sandwiches. Hot coffee, ice cream. A coffee, please. Right away, thank you. - Milk or sugar, Ma'am. - Nothing, thanks. I absolutely love trains. They have a destination and are a place you can call home. Day after day, they leave and come right back. Return and leave again. Without ever getting lost. It's amazing. I, instead… always lose myself. Hey, let me borrow 100¥. 50¥. 10¥... "Hojo" "20¥" Good day. Good day. - I'm going. - Yes, okay. "Client Satisfaction: Remember your duties. As an assistant, aim for zero complaints." "Employee Satisfaction: make them like you." "Best Service Competition." "Award: Romance Car… Hachiko Hojo" Basic Customer Service language: "Welcome aboard." "Welcome aboard." - "My apologies for making you wait." - "My apologies for making you wait." "Thank you very much." "Thank you very much." Today, there isn't anything in particular to do. Like always, treat our passengers with the utmost courtesy and sincerity. Of course. Today's train is an express 60.000 MSE Limited. We'll do our best. I'm freezing! Today's the coldest day of the year. Sure seems like it. - Miss Kubo. - Yes? - There's hot coffee on the menu. - Ah… Restaurant service. Bento, sandwiches, hot coffee, ice cream as well. - A coffee, please. - Right away, thank you. I'm a bit famished as well. Would you like a sandwich with the coffee as well? - Do you have any with pork? - Yes, of course. - I'll have one of those, then. - Sure thing, thank you. They're delicious, no? Definitely. A glutton's breakfast! Would you like milk or sugar, Sir? No thanks, I don't think I'll need any more calories! That would be 10.50¥, thank you. 10.50¥ exactly! Thank you very much. - Miss Hojo. - What is it? I crushed a bento with the trolley. Do you have an extra autumn menu? Pardon me. - Here you go. - Thanks. Bento… What the hell are you doing?! - I'm so very sorry. - Then, do something! I'll leave it here for just a second. Please forgive me. Are you cleaning it or not? Excuse me… Excuse me. Sir, I'm mortified. Did you get burned? No, but… Your... Please accept our excuses. I'll get a cloth. A napkin will be fine. Yes, of course. Coffee. May I? - Here's another coffee. - I'll pay. - That's not needed. - Are you sure? We caused you an issue. Thanks, then. Again, sorry about this. Thanks for your patience. I'm very sorry. Miss Hojo. Thanks for the help. Miss Kubo, I did not wish to say this, but… you need to get a grip. How many coffees did you spill already? I'll take a guess, however… I'd say around 8. But within the last 6 months. And how many bentos did you crush? Good question… Not as many as the coffees, however… I'd say I crushed around 7. Regardless of the knowledge you have, you can get fired. I'll be more careful. Ah, Miss Hojo, would you like a candy? - No, thanks. - Alright. After all this time? - Miss Hojo? - Yes? It's almost time. I'm well aware. Please don't get angry. We need to make just one more round, we can do it. Let's fight! - Milk or sugar, Ma'am? - Neither, thank you. It's quite hot, watch out. That would be 6.40¥. Perfect. Thank you very much. Sir. Yes? We have a problem. - Oh really? - You stole that. Stole what? That! - That's not true! - I saw you. No, no. I was only looking your way. You're mistaken. - I'm not mistaken. - What's the issue? He stole that. Like I said, you're wrong! I've already paid you. - He's lying! - That's not true! Can we please just calm down? Sir, would you like to tell the assistant what happened? Like I said, I was about to pay. Thank you for choosing Romance Car. Please wait for the train to stop before exiting. Good job. Would you be so kind to come to our office and explain what happened? You as well, Miss Hojo. Wait! If you didn't steal it, why are you running? You… can run… fast! We only have green tea. Here you go. Let's not… make this a bigger issue. What?! I don't understand. "Hakone's Spa - Vapour Paradise" He can steal and get away with it? Where do you think we are? You say you saw him steal, but he says he paid for it. He did, in fact, pay. Then, why did he run? Because you're scary. When someone accuses you of stealing, you panic and try to run. Because you had a guilty conscience, right? How scary. You look like a cop questioning someone. If I were one, you'd be in handcuffs. If the cop were as cute as you it could be fun. Old man, want to fight? That's enough now... The issue's been resolved, okay? Miss Hojo, you're still in service. The train back to Shinjuku will arrive in 32 minutes. I will contact the office. Drink your tea. Thank you. Excuse me. Good and hot. Good day. The train for Odarawa is leaving on platform 2. Passengers headed for Shinjuku can change at Odawara station. Mind the gap. I'm sorry. It was a big misunderstanding. It's been a bummer for both of us. - Don't speak to me, old man. - "Old man"? There's still life in me yet. By the way, I'm Sakuraba. "Sakura", like the flower. Am I annoying? I am, admittedly. But you have such flowery language. You might be good at your job, but, you know what they say, a person's true character shows when under pressure. And yours is so strange, that's what I wanted to say. You're stressed… Where are you going? Darn it! What are you doing?! - What?! - Stop that. You're going through other people's belongings! Wait a minute! But… Calm down. I was wrong. When I saw how you were acting… This person… What they said to you. Are you contemplating suicide? Don't be silly. I'm not joking. Listen. "I'll go far, far away, from where our best memories lie." It's clearly a call for help. - No, it's talking about a trip. - Come on! Read between the lines! Do you really believe that? It's not normal to write like this. It's a message. Without a doubt. What is this letter about? My mother. Goodbye, Hachiko. Be a good girl. After that, it was like my mother's mind had turned off. The number of men that followed was like a nightmare. It's her, for sure. Hachiko Hojo, right? My father is cheating with your mother. My parents might get a divorce. It's all your mother's fault. Hey, stupid. Aren't you going to say sorry? I'm… sorry. Leave this place. Both you and your mother. In the end, it was her who left. Hachiko! Are you going home? Great timing! You want to go to karaoke? Who is he? - Mommy's boyfriend. - Aya's father? Don't be silly, Hachiko. Hey, who is "Aya's father"? Is it a secret? Silly. She's mistaken, it's nobody. Let's to go to karaoke! Ka-ra-o-ke… Will she go home... crossing the green sasuki grass? Hey, listen! It's time… I'll make it a memory. I can't sing at all! Together with Toshio. I meant to say Hachiko's father. Before our divorce… we went to Hakone! On the Romance Car. We went everywhere. The sasuki grass was already brown, but it was so much fun! Don't start again! Don't talk about your ex when I'm around. Right, Hachiko? Come on, stop it. Let's do a duet! "The man whom I thought I'd settle down with, "and marry, left me. "For memory's sake, "I decided to visit Hakone, like we did when we were a family, "many years ago… "Whenever I feel down, I think about that trip to Hakone. "It was the happiest moment in my life. "Maybe I'm just too sentimental. "By the way, "I'm worried about you, that's why I wrote you. "I can imagine your job is hard on you, but take care of yourself. Yoriko." There are no doubts. Let's go. Hey! We need to find her. She has to be around here somewhere. But… wait, old man! Life is full of regrets. If you don't act on them, those regrets will become even stronger. You're crazy! A superficial decision could make it so that you might never see someone again. Excuse me, her mother is in danger! Tell that to her boss! Okay… Have a good trip. - Let's go. - Hey! Isn't this a kidnapping? Kidnapping a 20 year old? I wouldn't have the guts to kidnap anyone. But if I say that it's a kidnapping, it is, no? I'd imagine so. But you didn't ask the conductor for help. You could have shouted. Yelled it out loud. But you didn't. Why is that? Maybe you're worried about her. If you don't trust me, open the window and call out. But if you stop now, you won't achieve anything. Am I wrong? You tore apart her letter, I don't think you two got along. Where are we heading to? Where did you make that trip? We're looking for your mother, so say something. If you don't talk, we'll continue driving nowhere and then head back. First, we need to find you some clothes. No… I mean… You know… I don't have… …money. This Old Man will buy them for you. Well, you look like a pervert! I didn't mean that in a bad way… Now, it looks like I'm proving you right! Forget about it, we're going shopping. Too boring? Old people clothes. Ah, it's for men. Also these… This is cute, no? Wait… How about this? No? You know, this reminds me of "My Fair Lady." You know it? The film with Audrey Hepburn. I know Audrey Hepburn. It's an old film, anyways. Young people these days no longer watch films! I'll take this, thank you. You don't know what suits you. Something more… Here we go. This colour suits you better, no? No, no, no… These are better. Look how good these would look on you. What size? 36. What great attenuation, for such small feet. Do you remember something about the trip? - A castle. - A castle? Ah, Odawara castle! Okay! Don't you need a map? I searched for quite a few locations in Hakone. I know the area. You searched for locations? Ehm… Have you watched the movie "I'll be Your Chef"? - From last year? - Exactly. That one. I made it. One of my friends said the money for the tickets was wasted. She said she should've waited to see it on TV. She said that? Anyways, I went here looking for film locations. You're totally uninterested. What's the matter? Do I stink? Does this old man stink? Hey… What was your role in that film? I was the producer. My name is in the film credits. "Yoichi Sakuraba". What does a producer do? Ehm, well... He finds the money… and other things. He produces the movie. What's wrong? I knew you looked shady. "Shady"? Call for a visitor. Hachiko Hojo's mother… Hachiko Hojo's mother… please go to the castle tower. Your daughter is waiting for you. Why are you embarrassing me? I thought it's the most effective course of action. Oh my God. - How did you recognize my name? - From your identification tag. And from the letter. "Hachiko" isn't a common name. The ocean. - Excuse me… - Yes? Could you please take a photo of us? - Certainly. - This is the button. Got it. Daddy! Moe! Let's take a photo together. - Okay, stay still. - Make the peace sign, Moe. Okay, Moe. Now, stay still. Here we go. - Stand straight. - And smile. Peace. We're ready. Taking it now. And… smile! Mommy, my eyes were closed. - Would you mind taking another? - No problem. Smile! Thanks a million! Look, Moe. That was Hakone. Yesterday, we took the train that went up the mountain. - And the front and the back switched? - Exactly! - It was really fun! - We'll come back here again sometime. Yes! Tomorrow! No, not tomorrow. Have you ever been here? I don't think your mother is here. We'll take the train up the mountain. How cool! What a feeling… Wow! Magnificent! It's a railway bridge. The bridge is over the river. Look. Wow! Look at that! It's too high. It's scary! Are we headed there? I think so. There's a cable car. When approaching the Gora Station, we will be going up a very steep slope. Given the danger of being on a single track, the conductor and the train driver will alternate at each curve. There will be three changes during this route. Now, he's on the front. Hey, mommy. Come here, Hachiko. Wow! I don't mind the smell of sulfur. I like it actually. It's really good. Sulfuric! "Beware of volcanic gases" "Sulfur dioxide can harm the eyes and the respiratory tract." The weather up in the mountains changes quickly. Ow! Ow! That burns! It's hot, but it's good! It's hot as hell! There are many families with children. It's easier to bring them during the week. When my daughter was small, we had so much fun here. What's that look? Ah! I look too young to have children? No. I feel sorry for the daughter who has a thief for a father. For the hundredth time, I wasn't stealing. - Age? - 45. Your daughter's. Your humor isn't funny. She's 9. - Is she pretty? - Plain, but pretty. Her mother and I are divorced, so I haven't seen her for two years now. My eyes feel strange. "Keychain with a name" Hi! She ran off. She must have thought, "Ugly old man". Do they have one with "Hachiko"? I don't think so. They have all kinds of strange names. "Hachiko" isn't that special. It's not that special? My parents searched for it a lot. They even have "Yoriko", but not "Hachiko"… Here's "Toshio". If we continue to search, we'll find "Hachiko". Okay, let's find it! I'm hungry, should we leave? No. We'll find it. Hey, is this it? No. It's "Hatsuko". - I need glasses. - Come on! - I'm joking. - My lord, how silly you are. - We're almost there. - We need to look here. They never found it. The strange thing was, even though they fought a lot, that day, they both seemed very happy. They keychain didn't matter. I didn't want to go back home and wished that the trip would last forever. Excuse me. You're full of joy, huh? Are you hungry? What do you think about getting some soba? It's all so sulphurous. Yeah… I'd say so. God, it's delicious. I was starving. A nice egg would raise it to the next level. Here's the water for the soba. Madam! The soba is fantastic. Hakone's soba is really delicious. You can say that. Recently, they've opened a lot of luxury shops. The noodles are freshly made, right? You can tell? How pleased I am! - You made it this morning. - Exactly! They have a different aroma, right? You must have a very refined taste. I know my soba. And this could be the best I've ever had. I couldn't be more happy to hear you say that. Hang on, wait… Madam! Don't do that. Don't worry about it. - But it's too much! - It's on the house. It's the least I can do for your nice compliments. But don't tell anyone. I'm glad we came here. Thank you. Thank you, madam! Old man. What is it? - What was that thing about? - What thing? That story about the soba. You had no idea it was freshly made. That's not true. You read it here. Hachiko… You're smart. You know… making movies is really tough. Dealing with people that you've just met. Trying to film in locations with low budgets. At the time, I learned all that I could, so I needed to talk about it. Once, I was even the silent type. Then, I started to talk more. I guess that's part of the job. We've been there. And here as well. You're not listening to anything, right? Nice view. Yes. Did you know that Ashi Lake was formed 3.000 years ago, when mount Kamiyama erupted, and a chunk of the mountain slid and formed a crater? I read that in the guide book. Me too. You also said that you've been here before. - Was that a lie as well? - I came here a couple of times. But we avoided tourist areas. It's my first time at Owakudani and Lake Ashi. They're nice places, though. Anyways, did you see anyone that could look like your mother? Come on, keep your eyes peeled. Let's go to a different area. Good day to you. Look at that sasuke grass! At the top of the promontory, someone is fishing… Will he return home by crossing the green sasuke? That song does not talk about this sasuke grass. And it's not even green. Who cares? It's still nice. But, in the summer, it's so green and beautiful. That's true. But it's more of an autumn grass now. Somewhere in Japan… What a mess! How sad… It's over. Don't say that. There will be other trips. - I hope so. - We'll come here next year. Good idea. We can always come back next year. All together! But now it's time to go. And one and… Jump! Again, again! Susuki… Old man? - I think it's enough now. - Huh? Enough. Let's go. Let's return to Tokyo. But… - We still haven't found your mother. - She's not here. - It's not close enough. - Yes, but… I haven't seen her… since I graduated. I wouldn't recognize her. Don't say that. What if your mother really wanted to hurt herself? She won't do that. - Let's leave. This is becoming stupid. - Wait. Don't go. Stay with me a bit more. - What…? - Just a bit more! I don't want to go back yet. - That's your problem. - I know. But… Not for long. Just for a bit.. You can take the train this evening. Please… You're hurting my arm. Sorry. I'm tired… of how I am. When I think of her, I get angry... like a child. At my age... saying something like that to an old person… It's ridiculous. Why? Is it wrong? I'm a parent as well, remember? Even though my daughter thinks that her bastard of a father should die, I could never hate her. But knowing that she thinks that of me is hard to accept! It's your fault. I know. Good, well. Let's go back to Tokyo. Old man! Let's search a bit more. Don't do that! I want to ride a bike. What do you mean? - Have you ever seen "E.T."? - No. The youth of today don't even know "E.T."! How loud! Steven… Spiel… Didn't you ride a bike last time? Isn't this awesome, Hachiko? Breath in the fresh air. A bakery! The bread must be excellent! - A bakery! - Like a little girl! Damn it, I've lost my enthusiasm... I wanted something sweet. Then, let's go to a hotel. I don't think we'll find a love hotel around here. Being ignored is the thing that hurts the most. Coffee with milk. - Get a sweet or something similar. - I don't like sweets. What the hell? We came all the way here. What do you think? How is the cheese cake? The chestnut waffles are currently the most popular. Okay, I'll have one of those. - Sure thing. - And coffee with milk. - Mind if I take the menu? - Sure. Thank you. Have you been here as a child? No, we only tasted the tea. We stayed in a cheap hotel. So good… So delicious! What are you looking at? Want some? Forget about it! You'll need to order one. What the hell am I doing here with this old man? And what is this? Icecream! It's full of icecream! How delicious! You want some? Here I am. - Hello, dear. - Daddy! Ready to go? Where? We're going to the hot springs together. Yes! Let's go. Good. What? Nothing. Why did you decide to make that movie? I thought it would be fun, so I found a job in a production house. They easily hired third-rate graduates as well. Ah, I get it now. You don't have to "get it" so well. Those were splendid times. It was just before the economic bubble burst. A lot was spent for the productions, we went to Hawaii and the sort. For filming? No filming, just "Aloha". Nevermind. I don't understand. Are you really a producer, old man? What are you trying to say? Are you still doubting me? Hey! Wait! There were organizations that invested money. I produced an important film. The budget was 10 million ¥. It took 4 years to complete. What was it called? "Floating in a Dream, You Fall Like a Petal." It was a spectacular period film, with a stellar cast. I've never heard of it. It was an epic failure. It turned out horrible. Now that I think of it, that title was a premonition. All of your films are failures. Yeah. With movies, I always want to do one more try. But when I'm making one, I just want to quit. How strange. It's strange indeed. What is it? We saw Mount Fuji. It was the last thing we did. But we've already seen it. Closer. At the foot of the mountain. It was enormous. All right. We'll stay for the sunset and then return home. Well… this is life. No. You're too young too talk like that. Try to imagine it, Hachiko. Close your eyes… and form an image in your mind. I see it. It's right here. It's just like mount Fuji went "boom"! Mount Fuji, "boom"! I'm not joking. Try it. Close your eyes. So? Do you see it? Yes, I see it. Mount Fuji, "boom"! Right? Mount Fuji, "boom"! It's starting to get cold. Let's go home. Huh? How strange. What? What is it? This looks like a different road. Hang on. Are we lost? Don't worry. - Use the navigator. - I never use that thing. Everything's fine. I looked up some locations around here. Everything's fine. What's up with you? It's written too small. Why doesn't it work? - Darn, we'll lose the last train. - I understand… Let's see… We're around here. What's written here? - Nagao Pass. - Good. We should be in this area, so if we stick to this road we should get there. Will we make it? - If we get a move on. - Then, hurry up and go. Hey, old man… Where are we? It's the first time I'm seeing this place. It's an energizing feeling. Too bad it's pitch dark! Don't be silent. I can't stand angry women. And I can't stand men who get lost while reading a map. Sarcastic women irritate me like hell! What the hell? I thought we were friends. What are you saying? You disgust me. Where are you going? Where the lights are. You're like a moth. Lady Hachiko. Lady Hachiko. Forgive me. I'm afraid this is the only place where we can sleep. Are you stupid or what? Go by yourself. I'm sleeping in the car. I'm sorry, but we can't keep the motor turned on all night, so you can't use the heating. When you do that, you really know how to make a person feel like crap. I know. But really, leave me alone, old man. While you had your nice little nap, I drove everywhere in the dark. Maybe the earth's magnetic fields are going crazy. Or I'm cursed. It felt like I was driving nowhere. - You're cursed. - Come on, enough. I don't like these things. Or we could… sleep outside. I know. Let's do this: sleep in different rooms. Agreed. Business is growing. We only have one room left. The Deluxe Room. - Really? - So? Will you be taking it? - Get it. - We'll take it. The Deluxe Room is more expensive, so these articles are included. Please be sure to return them. What do we do? And this is also a present for guests of the Deluxe Room. We don't need them. What a place! A while back, I produced a film titled "La La La Love Hotel." I looked for a place like this. We tried to copy "Love Hotel" from Shinji Somai, failing miserably. We were fortunate to not win the Razzie Award. The difference in talent can be brutal… - Old man. - Yes? Don't you try anything on me. Understood. This film will be a success. It'll make more than 50 million ¥ for sure. Sir Sudo, we have an informal agreement with Yoko Maki, the actress that you admire. Really? - Yoko Maki? - Yes. What a surprise. The thing is... our society has never invested much in films. As a business, we don't want to have any regrets. Sir Sudo, a life without any regrets does not exist. It all depends on how things are managed. I've been making films for a while, and I've always had regrets. "Should I have done this or that?" Whichever one it may be… not making that film would have been a worse choice. Not doing anything would have been the biggest regret of all. Do you not agree? The regret of inaction… I did not expect to learn that from someone younger than my son. Sir Sakuraba, to be honest… cinema is a dream I've had all my life. Yes! That's it! Films are dreams! Everyone in the world is living the reality of the economic crisis. The young no longer have great ambitions. For this reason, films are full of dreams. We have the rights and a leading actress. It can't go wrong. Let's make a film. Together. - We have a deal! - Thanks a lot! Please come out, Sir Sakuraba. The police are searching for you. Sakuraba! Don't pretend to not be in there, asshole! Give me my money! You bastard! Sakuraba! can you hear me, bastard?! You shut up! Sakuraba! Come out! It's better to come out now than to be arrested, no? Hey, son of a bitch! Look me in the face! People should live with sobriety. Especially the idiots. Order whatever you want. Gratin? Fried shrimp? Ah, I know… A steak? What do you think? She'll have a steak, please. A coffee for me. A steak and a coffee. Thanks. Your order will be ready shortly. Hachiko. Do you like school? Hachiko. By the way… You remember that man who always visited our house? Me and him… aren't together anymore. He said he doubted whether I'd ever forget about your father. I told him I would, but he didn't believe me. He's disgusting. Everyone always leaves me. But you won't leave, right? You'll stay with mommy, right? Right? Careful, it's hot. Delicious, as always! Eat up. Need a hand? Okay. Are you sure? Mommy isn't hungry. It's for you, Hachiko. Eat it all. Stupid woman. What's the matter? What do you mean? Are you okay? That woman… was kind to me… only when things with her men were going badly. After she and Dad separated… all her men… were the exact opposite of him. If it was like that, what did she regret... she shouldn't have broken up with him. We don't have any connection with each other. More than my mother… this is the story of any woman. I'm sorry. My weird antics got you confused. You don't have anything to do with it. It's my problem. What am I doing? This is a dirty old man, after all. He's attacking me when I'm most vulnerable. And I'll be a stupid useless slut if I let a man do this to me. We are the same. Maybe he's perfect for me, then? Sorry… I… am tired, I don't know. It doesn't matter. Are you not angry? Why should I be? There's no reason. You are… really kind. I am… I'm a fool. A total failure. Are we in the savannah or what?! My films were all failures. And I've been a failure as well from the start. And when things went wrong, I recited the usual spiel for the investors. I only wanted the money. But the interest on my previous loans all swelled out of proportion. That ‘big movie' made it all worse. I got sued from people everywhere. In the beginning, some people tried to help me out, but in the end everyone left. If that film had succeeded… I think I could have restarted things... with my ex wife and my daughter. To me, it didn't matter what… or where. I boarded the Romance Car for that reason. The coin… Heads, I get the Romance Car. If it had been tails, I would have gone to Chiba. Then, I read your strange letter. "Here we have it", I thought. Just for a day. I wanted to escape from my reality. I wanted something. Something to make me forget about everything. That's the reason why… this is all my fault. Your mother is alive. I'm sorry to have made you leave… with me. Forgive this kiss. Hachiko, you are ugly when you do that! Quiet. Huh? What the hell? Oh well… I'll sing, instead. I beg you, don't. While I gaze at the north skies Where shortly the snow will melt… I regret the dreams of days gone by Why pick that song? It's a nice song for a trip. Today is the beginning of our journey. Those who won't return They cross my burning chest But, at least, for today I'll depart for my journey What?! You know it?! It's old, but famous. You don't know anything about films but you know old songs. My mother… Always sang it at the karaoke when she got drunk. By the way, why do you work at the Romance Car? Good question. At the time, many interviews. didn't go well. the only one I got accepted at was a caterer at Romance Car. Got it. I thought it had something to do with childhood memories. Not consciously. But maybe that was the case, after all. Somewhere in Japan There's someone waiting for me It's a perfect day to go search for the sunset On my mother's back, I hear a song as we walk Thanks. You spent a lot of money. - Forget about it. - Your debts… You don't know? When a debt becomes huge, it's no longer called a "debt". So unfortunate! What will you do now, old man? This old man will decide his future… with this coin. Tails. It's decided. But it's heads! - It's tails. - No. You're older than me and you don't know the difference? The flower is heads. The number is tails. Seriously?! I didn't know… Heads, huh? That means... that yesterday was all a mistake. Who cares? So then… take care. Yes… Goodbye. I forgot to give you this. So lame. I know. Too lame to dangle somewhere. Thanks. I hope you can give one to your wife and daughter. You got me now. So… Yes. Take care. Somewhere in Japan There's someone waiting for me It's a perfect day to go searching for happiness I sang this song as a child It's a song that travels with me Excuse me. Mr. Agent. I got lost. Oh, Mrs. Tashiro. You're early today. Your family must be worried. I'll accompany you home. Many thanks. Over here. The express for Odawara is leaving on the platform 2. Miss Hojo! I was worried about you! I'm sorry, Miss Kubo, it was bad on my part. - Is everything okay? - Nothing ever goes okay for me. But what happened to you? - A lot of things. - What's with those clothes? Ah… these… They really suit you. There is a right way to do things, Miss Hojo. As an employee, if something happens while in service, you must immediately contact your superior and inform them of the situation. But there was a thief! It's not your fault, Miss Hojo. He ran away and she chased after him. Then, the Romance Car took off. Also, in Hakone, she was informed that her mother is ill. - That's why… - If you fire her, I'm quitting as well! What? No… I'm not firing her. She's an excellent employee. So, you're not firing her? - So, are you leaving? - Absolutely not. However, don't let this happen again, okay? Yes. I apologize for the trouble I caused. "Hachiko" Excuse me. Restaurant Service. It would be a pleasure to take your orders. You're making a scene. Come on, sing with me. No, thanks. And one… Bento, sandwiches. Hot coffee, icecream. A coffee, please. A coffee, Miss? Yuko Oshima Koji Okura Music from: Yoshikazu Suou, Jirafa Written and directed by: Yuki Tanada
