eye on it for next time well I hope you do great job guys that is how we like to see our special effects in Hollywood ever flex might want everything to be epic but we also need things to be safe so

we're gonna be number one at the box office with this baby okay Sam we got a big scene tomorrow let's go through our lines okay Wow okay I seem to have quite a lot to say in this scene I know it's pretty tough to remember all that when you're you're not really an actor Sam hey wait I have an idea what I think you could do all that with a look a look but how would everyone know what's happening if I just do a look well I'll take the lines you do the look you know I want to help you as much as I can Sam really really I do okay flex thanks water look should I do I'll show you us actors trained

imagine things come on Haley time to go to work don't look so glum Sam listen we can't risk our big movie star getting hurt I mean who would finish the film [Music] okay Sam baby we're gonna film the cliffhangers seed all great action movies need a cliffhanger zine they so totally do before we go any further Don after last time I just want to check have you put any safety measures in place safety measures are you kidding we're up to our eyes and safety measures look look there are inflatable air bags at the bottom of the cliffs two of your crew on standby and everyone will be wearing safety harnesses I am not wearing a safety harness yeah but you are not doing anything dangerous flex of course I'm not the big hero is doing all the dangerous stuff now lowered Eragon to the ledge okay people were going for a take and exit ccall Norman are coming [Music] the shame he's gonna run on a rope before he gets to Derrick if you can't have a big hero movie star with his arm in a sling what happened where'd he go Oh No looks like his rope was too short how could that happen with all those safety measures wait look there is what [Music] okay stop not sure I like being Norman price that was great Sam baby you look like a real star one more scene to film and we're done for the day never mind that dawn I know you put airbags down but I could have been seriously injured sorry Sam I don't know what happened there well maybe someone gave you the wrong rope that was the second big accident on this movie set I think you need to pay more attention to safety hey I've got an idea Sam here is a fully qualified firefighter why doesn't he do the safety checks from now on Sam I'd be very happy to do that good idea flex [Music] yeah I think it's one of the best ideas I've ever had I'm sorry fireman sham that's all right Norman just don't do it again and cut that's a wrap everybody hey Sam could you check the cables on that bus ready for tomorrow of course storm oh yes I am very excited my boss will be famous have you got enough just check out the winch and the cadence Sam we need that bus to stop when it reaches the bottom of the hill if it doesn't we're all in trouble don't worry you leave that to me Don thanks Sam I feel a lot better now you're checking things over [Music] it's comforting isn't it I'm glad you're checking her Sam I wouldn't want her getting scratched or anything don't worry Trevor it all looks very sturdy she'll be a safest houses there all done I'm very excited about her scene tomorrow Sam we march in my bus you know movie it's like a dream come true [Music] what if they bring today then wait what that's strange [Music] so what's happening today mr. sledgehammer hey today we're gonna be shooting the runaway bus see all great action movies have a runaway bus scene and because this is a pontypandy our runaway bus is gonna be driven by a sheep no no in Hollywood we use a special trick we replace wooly with the the dummy sheet that our team of me we got the shot of the real sheep now replace wooly with the dummy computers at galaxy pictures we like to keep everything real when the bus comes careering out of control toward the camera get eating hey what don't worry Trevor your bus will be fine it's attached to a cable that fireman sam thy hero next door the star of the movie the Big Cheese is checked for us and it'll stop just before it reaches the camera ok let's go for a date [Music] this is gonna be such a great shot [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my purse just polished I'll call for help hey I already did it here oh I thought you were doing the safety check Sam I don't understand what happened it looks to me like the hero next door isn't such a hero after all you failed a simple safety check in endangered lives but I did check it I nearly got run over by a bus because of you you're gonna pay for this I'm gonna see to it that you never work in this town again [Music] I'm sorry fireman sam but mr. sledgehammer has informed me that due to an incident that happened yesterday you can no longer be the star of his motion picture mr. Dexter will be taking over as the main firefighter to be honest sir that's a relief yes however I am the bearer of much more severe news pontypandy is renowned for its firefighters we cannot have it known that one of our most respected firefighters failed the simplest of safety checks [Music] I understand sir I can't be a firefighter until this is investigated further no Sam you can't be a firefighter at all sir I'm sorry family Sam this is something I never thought I would have to do but a decision has been made [Music] great tangled hoses [Music] so I've had a big rewrite done on the movie your character firefighter Todd is now the hero we've had all the firefighter Sam pots taken out and we change the title firefighter Todd blaze & Glory learn your new lines and we'll see you on set tomorrow superstar ha ha you bet I'd like to accept this award on behalf of firefighters everywhere and I'd like to give fireman sam a special thank you for getting fired [Laughter] [Music] [Music] here are some more files for you James we've got some great scoops well I might have the biggest scoop ever don't be silly James you haven't even left the computer exactly and I've been looking at all the films you've made very carefully look what I found that's Plex next time and it looks like he's doing something with those safety lines I bet it was Plex the caused the accident uncle Uncle Sam fired we need to tell someone but with me to prove it first James would you like to join pontypandy planets team of investigative reporters I'm ready today we're gonna film the big explosion every great action movie needs a big explosion and this will be the biggest so flex the dummy of you will stay in the seat and eject out at the last minute before the explosion ha awesome we'll get that shot and then we'll cut that you fighting the fire ha ha I am gonna look super cool remember guys this is the big one the mothership the numero 1 make it big well don't worry flex it'll be massive massive is good but a hundred and ten percent massive is better after all you guys do put the special into special effects ok mr. Dexter split all flocks will never let you down spoons spoon whatever [Music] maybe you could do something else now that you're not a firefighter anymore well I'm not going to be an actor that's for

Trevor a new bus best that money can buy well it's a start but you can't just buy your way out of it then what well here's an idea you can come to the school and help me teach the kids about fire
