Soon after that, I found out what he really did. I wanted to leave, but Eddie promised me that his next job would be his last. It wasn't. And it never was. Cal was Eddie's guy. But he didn't want it, not the way Eddie did. I think it even scared him a little. But he was always there. Always... even. We started confiding in each other, and eventually we fell in love. It was Eddie you were hiding from. When you were here. We came without a plan. We got restless, and we left. That's when Eddie found us. He loved us too much to hurt us, but he wasn't gonna let us go without getting something in return. So we made a deal. We would get to be together. We could get out. But one day Eddie would call, and Cal wouldn't be able to say no. That was me. That was you. I work at the university, and Cal's at a moving company. Paul thinks he's his dad. - (pouring coffee) - And a really good one. As time went on, we thought it might really be over. That we might really have... gotten out. We put the past in a box, and we put that box in a secret drawer. And we thought that maybe it would just... ...disappear. I'm so sorry. (sighs softly) That guy Mike at the club... He's a real piece of shit, always has been. And I knew it would be dangerous there. Things have been like that since Eddie killed Marvin. But going there was the best option we had. What do you mean? If I'm right, word will get to Cal that I'm in the city, and once Cal knows that, he'll find us. Mike works with Eddie? They did some jobs together. Then Eddie shot his ear off.
