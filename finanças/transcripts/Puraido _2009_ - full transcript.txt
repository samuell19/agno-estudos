PRIDE BC Cleaning Service here! It's just a father and daughter, so the house is pretty clean. Just get the nooks and crannies. That'll really help. We will. Thank you. Hello. I'm from the cleaning service. Welcome. Wow! A ticket to La Traviata! This is a $500 ticket! Incredible! You like opera? Yes, but I've only seen it on TV. The opera's expensive. It's not for people like me. Tell you what. I've an extra ticket. Would you like it? What? Oh, no. It's way out of my reach. I'm broke this month. I'm not asking for money. I just don't want to see it wasted. Please, be my guest. But something this expensive... Expensive or not, it's of no use to me. And you seem to want to go. It's either that or the trash. Bravo! Wow... even her pianissimo transcends the orchestra. Unbelievable! You've a good appreciation. Can I get you a coffee, Miss Asami? At least let me buy that. That's quite alright. On second thought, okay. Buy me a glass of champagne. Great. Excuse me... Oh, I'm Moe. Moe Midorikawa. I'm a music major. No wonder. I'm a music student, too. I'm so glad to meet you. Miss Asami, look! It's Haruko Matsushima! The opera singer! Shio-chan! What a pleasant surprise! How have you been? You grow more like your mother every day. Nice to see you, Madame Teacher. You're off to Italy to study? I've friends there you should meet. You're so kind. I'd planned to tell you before I left. This is Mr. Jinno, VP of Queen Records. Pleasure. How do you do? I'm Shio Asami. Do you know whose daughter this is? I'm afraid I don't. Sawako-chan, silly. Sawako Kihara. You don't say! Sawako Kihara? What an amazing soprano lirico. I was a huge fan. You're so kind. This is Ms. Natsuko, business proprietress in Ginza. What sort of business? A night club... for mostly older clientele. So I'm old, huh? - Your champagne, Miss Asami. - Thank you. Friend of yours? Yes, I'm so honored, Madame Matsushima. Moe Midorikawa, Senju Music School student. It's my dream to follow in your path. You do? A student from Senju? I see. Thanks for the champagne, Miss Midorikawa. It must be nice... to have money, a grand piano at home... attend an expensive music school... and be Sawako Kihara's daughter. You're beautiful... well-connected. It's not fair. I'm sorry about that. But all I did was give you a ticket. Yes, one you were going to throw away. I'm sorry. I don't know what's come over me. Next to you, I just suddenly feel so pathetic. Though we're both human. I think I'll go home. I'm sorry. I'll go. No, you stay. I'm just envious. I don't like being envied. It's not my place to interfere but... here's the secret to success. Grab every opportunity, whatever that may entail. Learn both the main and back routes to the top. Okay. Because of my wealth, my musical pedigree... people just assume I must be conceited and condescending. I'm tired of it. Hi, Chief. Papa! I thought you were in New York. Cheers. What's this all about? Forgive me, Shio! My U.S. Company's bankrupt. And so am I. I have to return to New York tomorrow to tie things up. Tomorrow? This $20,000 is all I have. I'm so ashamed. All my accounts have been frozen. It all happened so fast. The house, too, is being collateralized. We'll have to leave. I can't send you to Italy. I'm so sorry. Don't worry about me. But what about you, Papa? Are you okay? Look at you, Chief. Strong as always. Never allowing yourself to be spoiled or waited upon. It's that strength I worry about. I'd planned to give you this at your wedding. I gave it to your mother at Ponte Vecchio when I proposed. She always wore it. She did? Think of it as your mother's way of watching over you. "Mita University of Music" Such a shame. You speak such good Italian, too. 2, 3 years studying abroad and you'd be ripe to turn pro. Thank you, but I've come to discuss what to do after graduation. Such a shame. You need a good sponsor. I know! You should enter that. Queen Records Parco de Opera Concours. I didn't recommend it before because I didn't think you needed it. 1 st prize is a scholarship to study in Italy! "Call for New Talent Competition Entrants" I kept remembering that advice about learning all the routes to success. I want to know... what a top prima donna thinks, what she worries about. "Parco de Opera Concours" Your demo tape passed audition with flying colors. Now they'll narrow the field to 10. But I'm not worried. After all, our school is the best. "Contestants' Dressing Room" It's great to see you again! I never got to thank you for letting me see such a top-notch opera. I'm glad the ticket went to good use. I was stunned when I saw the list. You go on right before me! Good luck to us both. Count me out. I'm too nervous. I'll probably forget all the words. Friend? Recent acquaintance. A Senju student. Not the best facilities there. Nor instructional staff. Who's judging today? Haruko Matsushima and... Takenori Kinoshita, Chairman of Japan Operatic Arts Association. Takashi Jinno, Vice-President of Queen Records. Shio Asami... I hear her father's company went bankrupt. She canceled her Italy study plans. "Shio Asami: G. Puccini" She's got rare charisma for a Japanese. Solid fundamentals, too. She's Sawako Kihara's daughter. I've taught her before. Her talent is genuine. That was amazing, Miss Asami. It's like listening to a pro. You gave me goose bumps. Thank you. Why are you complimenting a rival? Where's your ambition? Oh my. She can sing. The 10 finalists will be asked to change their vocal selection. They will sing in the order of lowest to highest preliminary scores. The finalists are... Who among these finalists will earn a dream scholarship... to study in Italy? Moe Midorikawa of Senju University... singing Mozart's Queen of the Night Aria. She seemed so innocent, and yet she's brought a change of costume. Who is she? Good showmanship, but sloopy. Surprisingly good voice, though. Technically, you're far superior. Just sing as you always do, and you'll win this. Relax. I will. Okay, then. Ready? Yes. Say... do you know how Sawako Kihara died? Hit by a car while protecting her daughter. What? You were only 2 so you probably don't remember. Poor Ms. Kihara. She died protecting you. Next is Shio Asami of Mita University... singing Casta Diva from Bellini's Norma. Miss Asami, are you ready? Congratulations. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Don't be. I know how hard this was for you. You're very talented. Really? Thank you. Good luck. Well, well, hello! Your piano was marvelous as always. You're looking well. I've followed your work closely. You fell apart pretty easily over nothing. You're much weaker than I expected. How dare you! "Over nothing"? Saying my mother died because of me is "nothing"? Miss Asami, apologize! That's okay. The sting won't last. You satisfied? Hit me again if you want. Or shall I get down on my knees? Have you no pride? I threw it away. It's of no use to me. You lost, Shio. When my husband was critically ill, I still sang with a smile on my face. That's what it is to be a performer. Truth is... I was once Haruko Matsushima's rival. We both studied in Italy. Our big chance came in our 3rd year. We were to sing for an artistic director who would choose between us. I was pale with fright. She offered me some hot chocolate. "It'll warm you up," she said. But it gave me indigestion, and made me feel ill. Singing was out of the question. She got the lead role. She poisoned me on purpose with that hot chocolate. Obviously... I'm still tortured by it. If only I had refused that drink... I could be where she is today, an opera singer. Ms. Yamamoto... "Club Prima Donna" Puccini and Mozart was a good combination. I'm very grateful to Mr. Jinno. The song choices, change of clothes... I wouldn't have thought of those. I advised her to grab any opportunity, but to go and say that. Say what? Though never publicly reported... it seems Sawako Kihara died while protecting Miss Asami. You said that to her? I realized something when I met her. That I was one of the losers. Well to be honest, I can't condone that kind of behavior. I needed to win no matter what. By whatever means necessary. I admire your guts. Please, Mr. Jinno. Be my producer. I want to defeat my former self. I wrote in a school essay that what I wanted most was my father. But really I want money. With money, I could buy a piano. My mom would be very happy. My mom sings at a bar, and never forgets to wear a smile. When I grow up, I want to wear a pretty dress and sing with her. Tami, wake up. I'm sorry. Tami, your daughter's here for you. You keep drinking like that and you'll lose your voice again. So what? I'm no singer. I'm a bar hostess. Jilted again by a boyfriend. She'll never learn. Think of it as an illness. Don't get smart! If I hadn't had you... I wouldn't have had to struggle like this. Don't give me that. You're the one who insisted on having her. It's a miracle she's not a delinquent. Why should she be? Who do you think's paying for her music school? What? Moe works three part-time jobs! Mama, let's go home. Give it back. Give me back my life! I can escape here soon. In Italy, I'll be able to sing to my heart's content. I'm not losing my one big opportunity... to leave and never return. Move! Stop! Thief! Somebody stop him! Please! "51 st Graduating Ceremony" Ranmaru! Take a picture with me! No way! Me first! Sign my yearbook! What is this, high school? Hold my hand! Give me your email address! Graduates get priority! Share and share alike! Who says? Shut up, all of you! Is something wrong? Like what? I'm Ranmaru Ikenohata, piano major. You're Shio Asami, right? You don't look very happy to be graduating. My purse was stolen. What, really? How much was in it? About $20,000. You carry around that much often? No, it's everything I had. I was supposed to live off of it. You've got to be joking. My father's company went under. That money was all I had left. The police didn't give me much encouragement. So the thief left you penniless? Honestly? Look, don't worry about it. Wait, you don't have money to get home, right? I'll lend you some. Thanks, but I've no way of paying it back. Then don't. Most girls I know use the word "loan" as "give" anyway. Well, I'm not one of them. Forget it, okay? Ran, it's bad manners to bring girls home from a thank-you-party. If you're going to do that, then live alone. Mom, I've graduated from all that. I bought that for $100. Nice try. You can't buy this for $100. Well I did, from a girl named Shio Asami. Her father's company went bankrupt. Asami? Oh my. Then she had all her money stolen. So I tried to help her out. $100 isn't much, though. I'm sure she's got plenty of dresses. All name brand shoes and bags, too. Only the very best, I'm sure. Think it's gone already? Wow, I can see why people were jealous of you. Will this stuff really sell? Whoa! $800. It's been used a lot. It's a "Kelly"! And you'll be fixing it up, right? You know it cost $8,000! Yes! $12,600 in cash! Thanks for all your help. Will that hold you for a while? Easily. But why go out of your way like this? I've no way of thanking you. Forget it. I just want to see you looking snooty again. Right, Chief? Sorry. Bad taste? No. You called me "Chief." Yeah, kind of a recent habit of mine. Offended? My father calls me "Chief." I kind of like it, actually. You said you're looking for work? My mom says she's met you before. Perhaps you remember her. Natsuko. She runs a nightclub in Ginza called "Prima Donna." You're her son? Feel free to say "no." She likes your eyes. She asked me to offer you part-time work until you find real work. You mean... as a hostess? You want me to be a bar hostess? Well yeah, but it's an exclusive club. Pays well, too. I should've known there was a reason for your helping me. Who do you think I am? What? I may need money, but I've no intention of earning it by fawning over strange men. How humiliating. Take half of this back... as a commission. I don't want your money. Didn't you hear me? I said you could say "no." You're a piece of work. My mom's work may be "humiliating" to you. But she's 100 times the woman you are. Selling your clothes was her idea. She was worried you'd never even washed rice. I skipped breakfast to get here. If you distrust people that much, you and your inflated pride can starve to death! He's right. I'm helpless but I put on airs and hurt people to protect my pride. What really do I have left to defend? I'm so sorry! Where's my mother? Could you take care of this, please? I'm afraid I can't just pay you money. All that is processed systematically. You'll just use it on Moe, right? Just give me half of it... as an advance. I put her in that music school she attends. Let's talk when you're sober. Mama! Stop it! Let's just go home, please! I just came for a little of what's owed me. Soon as I get it, I'll leave. Knock it off! Don't embarrass me like this! Embarrass you? Ha! I have a right! A big record company like this! They can spare a measly 10 grand! I'm warning you. If you don't leave... I'll kill ya! Careful with that thing! I'm your mother! I don't need a mother who interferes with her kid's dreams! It's a replica. The real one's at home. I'm on a schedule here. Would you accept this? Guess I'll have to. My daughter's trying to kill me. Don't bother coming home, Moe. You go too far. Please forgive me, Mr. Jinno. I'll do anything you ask! I promise! Don't abandon me! I have no family. You're all I have! Don't abandon me! Hello, Madame Matsushima... You speak Italian, don't you? Just enough to get by. Giovanni's in town. I was asked by Mr. Jinno to find an interpreter. Actually, he wants you. Hello. My interpreting skills are rudimentary. But I'll try my very best. You're plainly dressed. I thought it best considering... I didn't call you to attend a party with a secretary. Please change. What? Wear this dress. And those shoes. This purse and... we'll rent accessories. Call in a makeup artist. Certainly, Mr. Jinno. Send me the bill. This way, please. Queen Records sponsors the Parco de Opera Concours to nurture rising talent. That's wonderful. And you are quite a lovely opera singer yourself, no? He says "how wonderful." He asked if I sang opera, too. Introduce yourself. Tell him you're Sawako Kihara's daughter. I'm Asami. My mother is Sawako Kihara, an opera singer from long ago. Daughter of Sawako? I sang on stage with her once. She was a marvelous soprano lirico. We called her "The Asian Canary." I remember her well. I'd love to hear you sing sometime. Thank you. You're suited to this kind of world. It's hard to imagine you in an apartment. Would you consider marrying me? I need a wife if I'm to be President. And I'm tired of the tedious women I get set up with. You speak Italian and English, are Sawako's daughter... and you light up a party. You possess all the proper social graces. Above all, I like your strong sense of pride as a gentlewoman. But... I hardly know you. That's of no consequence. This is business. Business? You're well-qualified to be wife of the president at Queen Records. You can travel to Milano, Vienna... sing opera to your heart's content. Some people are made for certain things. A strong but inferior wildflower, you are not. No, you're a bright rose whose value has carefully been cultivated in a greenhouse. I don't wish to rush an answer. I worry about your ability to interact with others, Chief. I worry you may be alone and Ionely. If anything troubles you, call me anytime. I'll forever be on your side. Dear Father, I'm doing well. How about you? I have some news for you. How do I start? "Club Prima Donna" What a surprise. Good evening. Forgive the sudden intrusion. Shall I call Ran? No. Actually, I... Please come in. First time in a place like this? Yes. It's lovely. I admit it's not what I imagined. What did you imagine? That's a nice melody. Ran composed it. He did? If you like it, maybe Ran could accompany your singing. I doubt he would be inclined to do that. Why is that? I terribly betrayed his feelings of goodwill. As a matter of fact... I humiliated him with my groundless prejudice towards the hostess trade. I wouldn't want to see me, either. You're surprisingly unschooled in friendships. If that were true, we'd all be alone. I went overboard, too... telling you to starve to death. What? You said that to a lady? Apologize this instant! Okay! It was tit-for-tat. Oh, the customers are all male. They prefer female pianists. I'm sorry. No, the blame is all mine. How embarrassing... to have one's mom settle a fight. Say, Miss Asami... would you like to sing here? You and Ran together. We don't have a lounge singer and you'd be perfect. Me? But she's trained for opera. It's a different way of singing. Variety of experience is always good. I can take lessons from Madame Matsushima? Only once a week. But she'll make time. Oh my God. It's like a dream. This is Mr. Jinno's doing? Of course. But... what about... the fees. Mr. Jinno says not to worry about that. But you are living in a hotel at his expense. You need to find a place to live. I realize you haven't time with all your part-time jobs. But I've meant to. Well, I've conveyed his message. May I see him? I'd like to thank him personally. Please! Not immediately. His schedule is quite tight. 10 minutes... 5 minutes is fine! I'll make sure to convey that to him. But from now on, go through me. I couldn't stand the frustration of being denied. Was I too childish? Or was it because I lacked womanly attractiveness? So it was you who's been asking for me? I just had to speak with you. About what? Please use me here. "Use you"? As a hostess? The women here are refined and intelligent. I'd like to learn feminine deportment. I'm sorry but we're top class by even Ginza standards. Then put me in the kitchen. I've worked in restaurants and can cook anything! I'm also a cleaning pro. I work for a service. Please. Leaving so soon, Mr. Hoshino? - He's not feeling well. - Oh, no. I'm fine. Just need some fresh air. Good, nothing on your clothes. I'll get you a cold glass of water. That customer called for you. Gonzaburo Hoshino, Chairman of Hoshino Pharmaceuticals. He says he's getting too old to come here. If you can keep him coming, I'll hire you. I'm good with old folks. I helped old men in my neighborhood. But I have to tell you something. I've hired Shio Asami to sing here. Through Mr. Jinno? No. I hired her. I know what went on between you. And I don't approve of what you did. If a problem arises, you will be the one I let go. Do you understand? Perfectly. I won't do that kind of thing again. Find something for this lady to wear. Yes, Madame. Follow me. I hear you're debuting a new singer. Don't worry. I won't seat Miss Shio with customers. Yes, I know why you're here. Touche. You see right through me. Miss Shio would make a perfect wife for you. I could tell from the start. In exchange, I will introduce a magnanimous new customer. That was quick. Holding Miss Shio hostage could prove lucrative for me. That was delicious. Then let's go again. - Really? - Why not? Welcome, Mr. Funaki. Hello. Moe works fast. She's landed a regular already. Thanks to Chairman Hoshino. She's got us beat as a rookie. I'm Asami, your lounge singer. How do you do? Charmed. Shall we? Welcome. Mr. Jinno! I'm working here now. Yes, I heard you're doing well. Madame, can I be seated with Mr. Jinno? I've so much to tell him. Show Mr. Jinno to his table. It's ready for you as always. You're with Mr. Funaki today. You want him to lose face? You don't go rushing to another customer. - Where else can I see Mr. Jinno? - You don't understand. Here, we don't talk about ourselves. The customers talk, and we listen. If you want to talk about yourself, go to a bar. Congratulations on your professional singing career debut. Thank you. I adore roses. I hope for my sake you'll sing with all your heart. I intend to. For everyone. Only a handsome man like that can pull of such blatant gentility. - You're quite a charmer yourself. - Come on. His personally coming a club singer's debut. He must have his eyes on her. I would hope so, with such a large bouquet. That's out of my league. What's wrong? I really must speak to Mr. Jinno. Like I explained before, it's my job to speak to you. I will tell him exactly what you want to say. Don't worry. Well, I'm paying my school tuition through two part-time jobs. I've paid $12,000 for the 1 st semester. But the second semester... I mean, I have to rent an apartment. So I took another job in Ginza. But this job requires decent clothes and shoes and so... what do I do? Is this about money? No, it's not. Please, let me see Mr. Jinno! Forgive me but aren't you asking a little much from him? I realize that. But I have nobody else to turn to. Tuition, clothes, shoes and apartment? Next you'll ask him to be your boyfriend. Do you know the VP's cell number? If I did, I wouldn't be here. So you see? That's the nature of your relationship with him? He's taken a little pity on you. That's all. You should understand that. Ms. Arimori, you're being too harsh. Well, what's it going to take? I get irritated just looking at her. This girl's in love with our VP. Oops, I'm sorry. Laughable, right? Now that's mean. He's in Osaka. That's okay. I'll be fine. Bad experiences always give me strength. I mean, I tried to kill my mother. There's only one thing left that's important to me. And Ms. Arimori... you just laughed at that one thing, didn't you? Wh-what are you trying to say? I'm saying I won't forget today. Miss Midorikawa! I'm so sorry. You okay? Yes, I'm fine. I'm sorry to have worried you. Ms. Arimori's been on edge lately. Things aren't going well with her live-in boyfriend. Don't take it to heart. No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say such things. Forgive me. Oh... here. What a coincidence. Miss Asami! I'm Sayaka Higashino, 2nd year vocal major. I'm your biggest fan! I had no idea you were friends with Ran! I heard you didn't go to Italy? So what are you up to? Saya, shut up! I'm singing at a club. Really? What a waste! You should be singing opera. Please sing opera! Ran, dear? You're free to date who you wish. Just don't bring that loudmouth home.
