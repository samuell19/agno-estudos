(dramatic orchestral music) (moody orchestral music) - "Your paper must reopen the investigation of the so-called suicide of Eric Goran. It was murder. Murder for money. They called it suicide for lack of evidence. Well, I have your evidence. $200,000 of it. I found it after years of search. I found it with the aid of my faithful cat. My cat that creeps." Always had a hunch that Goran case smelled. Now we have it right in our laps. - Cora Williams. How do you like that? "The cat that creeps.” That's all Mrs. Williams, some poor relation of Elliot's. He lets her live out on the key, probably to save her from going to a nuthouse. - She's strictly crackpot. - Oh, yeah? Well, she sent that along with her letter. - A thousand dollars. (whistles) This bill's been out of circulation for 15 years. That and others like it could send Elliot to the chair. - Court's established Elliott's innocence. They refused to even hand down an indictment. Now, my boss... No, you gotta dig us some dirt from 15 years past. Look, Sampler, if it weren't two days before election, you wouldn't send out a cub on this assignment. - That's right, but it is. Mr. Elliott is running for the Senate. Now, if he were guilty of a slightly warmed over murder rap... Mind you, I said "if." - What you wouldn't do to get your brother-in-law re-elected to the Senate. - Ah, Terry, you're just saying that because it's true. That's what I like about you. - You've got a lot of guts, picking me for this assignment. - I don't know, you're the best newspaper man I've got. Besides, your connection to the Elliot family... - I thought so. Gentlemen of the press. - [Sampler] Stop kidding, Terry. - You're taking an awful chance, Sampler, nothing I'd rather do than double cross a stinker. - I'll take that chance. You're a newspaper man. I'm betting that you blow Elliot right into the DA's lap. - Well, blow again. I'm not taking the assignment. - All right. That's that. Who's the next best man? - Polish, I guess. - You're picking him from the bottom of the barrel, now, aren't you, boys? - Oh, he'd love to dig into this case. - Dig is right. - All that guy needs is a shovel and a dark night. - Okay, gentlemen, you've persuaded me, you and Dracula out there. Great story, boys. Great human interest. Is it true that you put rat poison in your baby's milk just for your morning laugh? - Good, old Terry. Straight from the shoulder. That's my boy, the spirit of a great reporter. Try to get some of that spirit in this yarn. - Got it. - Great story goes with that picture, boss. "The executive board of The Chronicle held their annual convention. As usual, the conference was held under a rug. The meeting was on such a low level, an observer said, 'The rug didn't even show a ripple." This reporter asked for a statement. The publisher only had this to say, and I quote, 'I'd crucify my own mother if I thought it would pay off.' Unquote." - That's my boy. (doorbell buzzes) - Coming. All right, all right. - My name is Terry Patrick Francis Osfield Omal Vaney Nichols. Terry to you. I represent the local sheet commonly known as The Chronicle and when I say "common,” I use the word advisedly. Having been commissioned by that worthless rag to interview one Mr. Walter Elliot, I would appreciate it if without further delay, you informed said gentlemen of my presence. My, the whole situation's improving. - Did someone hit you over the head, or are you drunk? - Definitely a blow on the head. My compliments. You're an excellent judge of character, but as for being drunk, I resent that gross insinuation. Or do I? Come to think of it, it seems like an excellent idea at this time. Where does Mr. Elliot keep the stuff? Oh, never mind. I have a nose for other people's business. Just announce me to the gent, posthaste, tout suite and pronto. (moody orchestral music) - Well, I see you still believe in the freedom of the press. - Oh. Will you join me in a spot of bourbon? - Thanks. A little early for me. - [Terry] That's where you're wrong, pops. Now's the time. You better make it a double. - Terry, may I ask the meaning of this unusual behavior? - And you better take it sitting down. When you hear what I have to say, you can knock off the bottle. Mr. Elliot, you're in trouble. - In trouble? I don't understand. - My paper doesn't think you ought to be senator. The boss prefers his brother-in-law. - If I were you, I'd inform Mr. Sampler that the polls decide an election. - Except when they're influenced by a piece of dirt. Say 15 years old. - Terry, what are you up to? - It's not me. Mrs. Williams sent the paper a letter, said Goran was murdered for $200,000. Now Sampler wants me to go out to Key Towers and explode the suicide theory in time to kill you off two days before election. Don't look now, but the upstairs maid is eavesdropping. - [Walter] Come in, Gay. - Gay, darling, I just want to tell you that I'm sorry... - I heard it all and I can understand everybody's position in the matter except yours. - Honey, how many times have I told you to never fall in love with a newspaper man? - Terry, how can you joke at a time like this? - Me? Joke? Believe me, sweetheart, I was never more serious in my life. Can't you see if I hadn't taken this assignment, someone else would've? Someone who'd be glad to blast your father's reputation without him even knowing about it. - Very generous of you, Terry. Obviously, if you were successful in your assignment, I'll be in no position to return the favor. - Well, anybody else would've gone straight to Mrs. Williams. I'm sorry, Gay. I didn't know just how to break it to you. I guess I made a fool outta myself. I thought by clowning around and making jokes, it could take some of the sting out of it. I can see I was wrong. (somber orchestral music) - Oh Dad, how could they do such a thing to you? - That's beside the point, dear. It's what this will do to you. You love that boy, don't you? - I did. Dad, what are we going to do? - It is all very simple, dear. I'll withdraw my name from the ticket and go away, just you and I. forget the whole thing. - No, Dad, we can't do that. As much as I hate to admit it, Terry was right. We've got to get this settled once and for all. - That's the way it should be in court. But think about it, Gay dear, an investigation, publicity, can you take all that? Are you sure that's what you want? - Yes, Dad. - In my opinion, it would be impossible for me or any other attorney to render a quick decision in a matter of such importance. We will need considerable -- - Mr. McGalvey's office. Yes, sir, he's in. Just a moment. Mr. Walter Elliot. - Elliot. Hello, Walter. How are you? What? Cora Williams? Now that sounds bad, Walter. You should have had her committed to an asylum years ago. Well, there's only one thing we can do. We'll have to get to the island before The Chronicle does. Our only chance is to beat them to Cora Williams. - I'll get my board ready to meet you at the dock right away. Yeah, same place. And Tom, locate that private detective who helped us before. Yes, Ken Grady. He might be useful now. - I'll take care of everything, Walter. Goodbye. Forget that letter. Locate Ken Grady. I wanna see him immediately. - [Connie] Yes, sir. - [Tom] Ms. Palmer? - [Connie] Yes, sir. - Don't make any engagements. We may have to work tonight. - Yes, sir. - What are we waiting for, Professor? - First act. Curtain oughta ring up any minute now. - Oh, see? The actors. - Who's directing this little production? - They don't need any direction. They're living their parts. Now, as the drama unfolds, see if you can spot the villain. - Oh, not a chance, not a black mustache in the bunch. - Get a shot of this little gathering. Use your infrared so they won't see you. - Look, brother, just tell me what, not how. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, well. Hey, who's that? - That's Ken Grady, the Irish Charlie Chan. Strictly a bad penny, that one. Sleeps with one eye open. He can't trust himself. - Mr. Elliot. - How are you, Grady? This is my daughter, Gay. - How do you do? - How do you do? - I think you know these folks. - Yes. - How are you? - Well, gentleman, if we cast off, we can get going. - Pidge, my boy, the time has come, the walrus said, when we must join the cast. - Why are we playing dead? - Strategy. There's no boat service on the island. I'm a light swimmer myself. We'll go along just for the ride. (whistle blows) Well, fancy meeting you here. - Oh, what are you doing here? - Temporarily, let's call it a double double-cross. Really, Mr. Elliot, I'm surprised after my warning. Well, that's what you get for trying to be nice to people. This is Pidge Laurie, my traveling companion. Always joins me on sea voyages. - Guess we can get along without you this time, Nichols. - That's right, Walter. We don't have to take this man with us. - Anti-social, huh? Frankly, I think you're all acting like kids. Remember, I'm the guy that put you onto this. I don't mind being double-crossed, but I don't like it when my back's turned. Let's start from scratch. We're all after the same thing. If we cooperate, we'll get it. We don't, we'll wind up in a rat race. What's wrong, Mr. Elliott? This is your party. Well, do we get passage on this tub? Did I hear someone say, "Yes?" - Unless my ears deceive me. - I think someone said, "Yes." Sorry, old boy. This seat's reserved. Well, haven't we met somewhere before? Funny, the people you think you used to know. (moody orchestral music) - You would. Did we capture this island in the recent war, or is it something left over from Spanish America? (eerie orchestral music) - That's odd. - What is? - There was a light in that upstairs window when we landed. - Maybe Mrs. Williams was frightened by the arrival of so many unbidden guests. Perhaps she read something about the rights of privacy. How about that, McGalvey? You seem allergic to crowds. - Your jokes need better timing, Nichols. - Take it easy, Tom. He's right. He could have come here alone. - Yes, that's what he said. Several times. I don't trust you, Nichols. - Thanks. I have the same faith in you. - Terry, there may be a story around here some place. These people are getting to be an awful pain in the -- - There's $200,000 hidden around here. That ought to cure any pain in the neck. Well, it's funny how fate throws people together. - That's gratitude for you. - And I gave her the best hugs of my life. You got the keys, Mr. Elliot? - I have no key to the house. I haven't been on this island in years. - Maybe we'll be lucky. It's locked. - We could try the bell. - I'm afraid she saw the delegation coming, so we'll all have to sweat it out 'til morning. - Mr. McGalvey, do you mind if I take a look around? - No, that's what you're here for. - Well, I don't know what you're gonna do, but I'm weary. I think I'll relax. - I could sure do with a drink. - Go tap a coconut, boy. - What do you suggest we do, Walter? - Well, I think I'll take a look around myself. (eerie orchestral music) - You know, Pidge, I could swear there was someone on the veranda with us. - That's a mirage. I'm afraid the jungle's got you. - Ah. It's all very real. Someone I used to know, someone beautiful. Very beautiful. - Where would you like me to send the flowers? Locked, huh? - To the outside world, yes. But there's no such thing as a locked door to a newspaper man. You would. Black magic. (eerie orchestral music) (cat screeches) - No! Ah! - [Gay] It came from upstairs. - I'll see you in Tony's bar. - Don't leave me now. Don't leave me. I need you, brother. (dramatic orchestral music) Somebody got here first. Look, Pidge, they'll all be in here in a moment to establish their alibis. I want a shot of everyone the instant they see the body. - What's going on here? (cat screeches) - Oh! - There, there, Ms. Palmer. It's only a cat. Nothing to be afraid of. - I can't help it. I hate cats. - Cat overlooked something, left a rat in the room. - Why would anyone want to kill a defenseless old woman? - That's obvious. Either to force her to reveal the whereabouts of the $200,000, or silence her forever on the Goran murder. Whoever it is, brace yourself. Mrs. Williams isn't dead yet. - Somebody go for a doctor. (voices chattering) - Now you're really throwing me. I figured the guilty one would tip his mitt and jump at the opportunity to get away, but you all can't be guilty. - I'll go. - Fine. Take the boat and go to the mainland. When you bring back a doctor, bring the police back with you. - Well, you can't let her make that trip alone. - [Terry] Pidge, give her the flashlight. - It's all right, Dad. - Now, let's get down to business. Pidge, you and Ms. Palmer see what you can do for Mrs. Williams I the doctor comes. The rest of us will retire to the drawing room and have a nice, cozy chat. - If there's gonna be an investigation, I'll conduct it. That's what I'm being paid for. - You've got the ball, Grady. I wouldn't stand in the way of a man earning an honest buck. - Mr. Elliott, you say you were walking alongside of the building when you heard the scream. - That's right. - And then you came in through the back door. - Yep. - Go ahead, go ahead. You're doing all right, Grady. - Thanks. And you, Mr. McGalvey? - Well, just as I told you, Ms. Palmer and I were going by the cellar. We saw the door open. We heard the scream, we came in. - I'm satisfied that Mr. Elliot, Mr. McGalvey and Ms. Palmer had nothing to do with it. - I'm glad you're satisfied. And where did you say you were, Grady? - How many times do I have to tell you? I came in through the cellar door. - That means you were in the house first. That would've given you time to get to Mrs. Williams before any of us. - What's my motive, junior G-man? - That's the $64 question, all right. - The others seem to be satisfied. - That only leaves Ms. Elliot's whereabouts to be accounted for. - Now, Terry, I warned you -- - Don't be like that, pops. On you, it doesn't look good. - Mr. Nichols, we all have an explanation of our whereabouts at the time Mrs. Williams was attacked except you, and your friend, the photographer. When Ms. Palmer and I came in the room, you two were already there. From where we were, it's only a matter of seconds to get to the bedroom. How did you get there so fast? - I walked in the front door. - But you said the front door was locked. - Did I say the front door was locked? You won't sue me, will you, Grady? (both laugh) - The boat, it's on fire. (dramatic orchestral music) - What's that old saying? "Burn your bridges behind you." We may as well settle down for the night. We're stuck on this island. Say, Mr. Elliot, with that skeleton key, you could open up most any door on this old house, couldn't you? - Possibly, I could. - How is she? - No better, poor soul. - Say, don't you think you ought to try and get some rest? - No, thank you. I'm quite all right. - Well, I'm glad you're all right. - Phew. Kind of chilly in here. I'm going outside where I can freeze in peace. - No fooling, honey. You look like you're just about ready to fold up. - Thanks. - Good, old Terry, always saying the right thing. - It really doesn't matter. - I ought to turn you across my knee. - Really? - You saw that skeleton key in your father's hand. You know what that means? - It means that you suspect my father. Think he's... - Until proven otherwise. If you'll stop acting like a sorority sister, I'll stand by you both. We can see this thing through together. - Sometimes, I think you really want to help us, Terry. And then again, I...it's all so mixed up. - Oh, let's talk about something pleasant. You remember the first time we met? - You fell off the deck of the boat and couldn't swim. I had to dive overboard for you. - Honey, I was born in Kansas, very little water around there. - But you could have been drowned. - Maybe I should have. - Don't say that. - Well, after all, fish have to eat. - Oh, Terry, can't you ever be serious? - Oh, I do have my moments. - [Pidge] That man's here again. - You would. - Well, what good's a fireplace without a fire? - Columbus the Second. Where did you discover it? - Well, you know that little house out back? Oh, what am I saying? You know the the little summer house by the boat landing? - Uh-huh? - There's a lot of it out there. I'll go get some more. Only this time, it'll take me longer. - Darn considerate of him, wasn't it? (tense orchestral music) - Ken, what are you doing here? - Shut up. - If someone should see you with me... - Nobody's going to. She croak yet? - No, she's just unconscious. - Did she say anything? - No. - You sure of that? - Ken, you know I wouldn't lie to you. - You wouldn't, huh? Not even for 200 grand? (Cora mumbles) -Mm..mm... - Listen, she's trying to say something. - Of money... - Take down every word she says. - 200,000... dollars. House. - Little....house. - I wonder what she meant by the "little house." - What are you gonna do with it? - [Ken] That's my business. - [Connie] Ken, you wouldn't. - Now, don't worry. Just keep watching the old lady and listen, she may open up again. I better get outta here. - Don't leave me here alone again. I couldn't stand it. - Where's your backbone? I've got work to do. - Well, let me go with you. I'll go crazy in this room with the old woman. - First the cat, then the old woman. Your weak nerves are getting expensive. There's $200,000 at stake. And you do what I say. Understand? (dramatic orchestral music) (Pidge groans) - Brother, am I glad to see you. - The feeling is mutual. What can I do for you, boy? - I'm blowing this joint, Terry. - What? Leaving this tropical paradise? - I just got kicked right on the chin. - Oh, you must have run into a tree. - Yeah. Shoe tree, size 10 and a half. - Look, I'm sorry, Pidge. I was only kidding. Boy, you really got clipped. - Well, of course I did. I'm leaving this hunk of underbrush as of now. - Aren't you forgetting one little item? Namely a boat. You'll never make it walking. - Well, then I'll sprout wings. But this is one island I'm giving back to the Japs. - Oh, show me where it happened. - If you don't mind, I'll stay here and draw you a diagram. You know that little house out back? Oh, I said it again. I mean the little... - Little summer house down by the landing. - Yeah, well, I was going in there to get some wood, and all of a sudden I could hear these footsteps. - The little house... cat. My cat creeping. My cat... Creeping...my cat. (eerie orchestral music) - No, go away. - Believe it or not, that's what happened. (Connie screams) - Here we go again. - Ms. Palmer. Ms. Palmer, what happened? - I don't know. - But you screamed. - I didn't scream. I must have fainted. - You're all right. Gay, you and Pidge, take her downstairs. Careful now. - Gentlemen, Ms. Williams will never talk again. Whoever attacked her came back and finished the job. - Poor Cora. - Your hands are trembling, Mr. Elliot. - Well, naturally. It's quite a shock. She was a relative. - That the only reason? - What do you mean? - I wanna know who killed her. - That's what we'd all like to know. - Well, Ms. Palmer was here in the room with her all the time, why don't you question her? - That's a good idea, McGalvey. - Get me out of here. I can't stand it anymore. - Take it easy, Ms. Palmer. You're all right now. Just tell us what happened. - You can't get anything out of her now. - Are you here to get information, or to conceal it? - Well, can't you see? She's hysterical. She won't make sense, anyway. - But you do, if keeping her from talking makes sense. - Well, I was just trying to help the girl. - Go on, Ms. Palmer. - When I went over to Mrs. Williams bed, she started reaching for me like a cat, clawing. Her eyes... - [Terry] Did she say anything? - Yes, she... Yes, but it wasn't very clear. I don't remember. Just then, I saw the shadow of a cat. It was creeping towards me. Then as I turned away, I saw a man's shadow on the wall. - [Terry] Whose was it? - I don't know. That's when I fainted. (eerie orchestral music) Look. (woman speaking in Spanish) - Forgive me. My native tongue is strange to you. - Yeah, but the rest of you looks vaguely familiar. - Who are you? - My name is Kyra. - What are you doing here? - I go wherever I am needed. Mrs. Williams beckoned to me, I came. - Mrs. Williams is dead. - Yes, I know. - Well, how would a dead woman call you? - There is an explanation, but you would not understand. - Try me. I'm a pretty clever Joe. - Within this cat is the spirit of my friend, Mrs. Williams. - Get it out of here. It's staring at me, like Mrs. Williams when she was clawing. - It's only your imagination, Ms. Palmer. - Get out of here, I tell you, get out. - But why should Ms. Palmer be upset about the cat? Mrs. Williams loved it. Unless Ms. Palmer knows something about... - Stop it. You'll drive her crazy. - My people say a murdered soul never rests until the murderer joins it. Within this cat is the spirit of Mrs. Williams. It will never rest until her murderer is found. - I didn't kill her. I didn't. - Get that cat out of here. - I see you do not believe in fate, Mr. Grady. - How did you know his name? - I know all of your names. You are Walter Elliot and you are his daughter. You are Mr. Nichols and you... - Glad to meet you, honey. Just call me Pidge. - It strikes me that for a stranger, you know a great deal. - Yes, Mr. McGalvey. You see, I too am guided by the spirit of one who was murdered 15 years ago on this very island. - And you're Eric Goran's daughter. - Yes. - Pidge, get her in the other room. (Pidge grunts) - Guy could make a fortune selling smelling salts around here. - I told you it was too much for her. - Put her down there, Pidge. - There you are, Ms. Palmer. You'll feel better in a minute. - Nice going, Kyra. Kyra? So you certainly picked yourself a nice name. I have a feeling you and I are gonna make a pretty good team. - Oh, she's coming out of it. - Well, Tom, we can't be of any help here. - She'll be all right, Walter, when she has a little rest. - Will you have a cigarette? - No, thanks. I'll smoke a pipe. - How is she? - [Pidge] Terrific. - I mean, Ms. Palmer. - Oh, her. Oh, she'll be all right. We need that girl, Pidge. She's important to us. - She's all right now. Just a little shock. I'll look after her. (foreboding orchestral music) That's the last time I'm gonna tell you. You better pull yourself together. - The only bright spot around this morgue is that Kyra doll. You know, I swear I've seen her face some place before. - You've been looking through the viewfinder so much, they all look alike to you. - Well, the faces maybe, but not the... - Always in there pitching, huh? - One of us has got to keep up the reputation. - Yeah, I'm sure getting nowhere fast. - Whatever you do, don't chase her. Even if you're wrong, don't chase her. - I know. It's guys like me that spoil women. - Well, now, don't you worry, son, 'cause I'm gonna put you over. Come with me. - Yes, daddy. - I've got a theory on this case. It's really a pip. (dramatic orchestral music) - Tom, I guess I can say goodbye to my senatorial ambitions. - Well, I must say, the situation doesn't look any too good. - [Gay] Dad? Dad? - Yes, Gay? - Dad, I found something. I think you oughta see it, too, Mr. McGalvey. - Ken Grady's card. Well, what of it? - [Gay] Look on the other side. - "The money, $200,000, the little house." Where'd you find it, Gay? - By the fireplace. - Doesn't look like a man's handwriting. - Maybe it's Ms. Palmer's? - Do you recognize it, Tom? - No, I don't. What could it mean? - Ms. Palmer was with Aunt Cora before she... - Do you suppose Cora spoke to her before she died? - Well, hardly in her condition. Don't say anything about this to anyone until we're sure. I'll see if Connie's well enough to question. (soft orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) - Now, you watch the old master at work. Once, up in Jersey, they were stuck on a case for... For three months, then I found a footprint. - What happened? - They caught the murderer in 10 minutes. Aha. Now, witness genius at work. First, the killer and the man who kicked me on the chin are one in the same. - Is that so? - Secondly, all you have to do is find the shoe that fits that print and you've got the murderer. Sort of a Cinderella pattern, see? See? It fits perfect... (Pidge chuckles) It just goes to show you, you can't judge a man by the size shoe he wears. - Genius at work, now on vacation. - Well, I'm no contortionist. I didn't kick myself in the chin. Now who did? - I know a thousand guys who'd like to. - Yeah, but they're all on the mainland. - Still, with that face of yours... - Speaking of faces, that Kyra doll, I knew a dame in Jersey once was a dead ringer for her. Only her name was Toots. Of course, Toots was a blonde and being a blonde, her complexion was a little different. Come to think of it, her eyes were a different color, too. Say, do you suppose that could be the same dame? (tense orchestral music) (eerie orchestral music) - [Connie] Go away. Go away from me. Go away, or I'll kill you. What do you want? - I followed the cat. Within it lives the spirit of a tortured body. The cat will lead me to the guilty one. The cat will point to... - Not to me. I didn't do it. I didn't kill anybody. - Who knows? You are touched with the greed of money. - No, no. I took money, but I didn't kill anybody. - [Kyra] Who killed Mrs. Williams? - I don't know, but I didn't kill her. Please, believe me. - But everything points to you. Even the cat. The cat knows. - Take it away. I'll tell. I didn't kill Mrs. Williams, but I know who did. I'll tell everything if you'll just take the cat away. Take it away. I'll tell. I'll tell. - Mr. Nichols, come quick. - What's up? - Ms. Palmer is ready to confess. - Is she dead? - Yep. - Terry, this case ought to be a cinch for you. All you have to do is watch 'em get murdered one by one, and when there's only one left -- besides me, that is -- well, there's your Killer. - [Walter] McGalvey, Grady, Kyra, help me! (dramatic orchestral music) - What happened? I don't know. I came in and she was lying here on the floor. - There, there, Gay. You'll be all right. - [Gay] Oh, Terry. It was horrible. - Who was it? - I don't know. I went over to the window because the light was better. Suddenly I saw a man's hand. - [Ken] Who was it? - I couldn't tell. He must have come from behind the curtain. I tried to call for help, but suddenly, everything went black. The card. It's gone. - Card. What kind of a card? - A business card. It was Mr. Grady's. - You mean one like this? - Yes, just like that. - And a very important piece of evidence. - Naturally. That's why somebody wanted to take it out of circulation. - Grady, if you had anything to do with it -- - What's the matter with you, Elliot? I'm here to help you. - [Gay] There was something written on the card in Ms. Palmer's handwriting. - Do you remember what it was? - Something about a little house. - Anything else? - And $200,000. - And she withheld the information. - Terry, why don't you ask her? She'll know. - Connie Palmer knew plenty, but she'll never tell. She's dead. - Dead? - We better get her outta here. - Yes. Come along, Gay. - I wish people would quit coming into this room. I'm getting awful tired running up and down those stairs. - In my opinion, we're no nearer a solution of this case than we were 15 years ago. - I agree with you, Walter. - What are you rolling around about? - I'm just looking. - Undoubtedly, Ms. Palmer held the secret of this entire affair. That's why the killer disposed of her. - Yeah. We know why, but we don't know who. (soft piano music) - Mr. Laurie, would you mind practicing on your own time? - Not at all. - McGalvey, Ms. Palmer worked for you. (keys plunk) Ms. Palmer worked for you. Maybe you can give us some information that would help. - Ours was purely a business relationship. Outside of that, I know nothing about her. - Then perhaps Ms. Goran. She was in the room when it happened. - Why, I know nothing. - Then maybe you could ask the cat why Connie was knocked off and who did it? - Wait a minute, Grady. I think you've got something there. - Ms. Goran, you said when you called Mr. Nichols to Ms. Palmer's room that she was still alive. - And when Nichols got there, she was dead. Now, was there anyone else in the room besides you and Ms. Palmer? - Yes. The cat was there. (Tom laughs) - I suppose you expect the cat to talk you out of this one? - The cat will make a great witness. How do you expect to get by with a story like that in the courtroom? - Tell that to the judge and jury. - You forget, Mr. Grady, that just before Ms. Palmer died, she made a partial confession because of the cat. - Cats, cats, cats. Is that all his investigation can -- - Take it easy, Walter. Control yourself. - You who seek to discredit a cat would be wiser to seek its assistance. At the proper time, the cat will reveal the guilty one. Until then, death will stalk this house. - Yeah, everybody seems more interested in the cat than the murderer. How about that, McGalvey? - Nichols, you have a nasty way of saying things. - I suppose I have, but it's obvious that whoever took the card from Ms. Elliot thought more of its importance than killing her. Tell me, Grady, just how important are your calling cards? - Listen, wise guy, when I go out on a case, I leave the cat at home. Why don't you ask Elliot? Maybe he wanted the card, but didn't want to see his daughter get hurt, at least not too much. Maybe they're trying to keep it in the family. - Are you trying to imply...? - Take it easy, Elliot. I didn't say you Killed anyone. - Now, wait a minute. Walter, as your attorney, I'll protect your interests. - Aren't you forgetting something, boys? You're all supposed to be on the same side. Come on, Pidge, let's get outta here. Far as I'm concerned, they can all choke each other. - Now you're talking. I'll light a fire on the beach and send up a smoke signal. Maybe a fishing boat will pick us up in time for breakfast. (foreboding orchestral music) - Look. - This is one place I won't miss. - Cut out the wishful thinking. We may get a better performance out of them now that they have no audience. - [Pidge] You mean we're not leaving? - That's just what I mean. - A thousand dollar bill. - It's working. - Perhaps the cat knows where the rest of the money is concealed. Perhaps if we follow the cat, we will also find the murderer. - I wish I could remember faces. - How can you? You never look at any. - Well, I don't know how you people feel, but all this nonsense about a superhuman cat, or perhaps I should say supernatural cat, doesn't impress me, but a good cup of coffee would. Anybody object if I raid the kitchen? - I could go for some fresh air. It's been a pretty rugged night. - Let's duck. - Gay, my first hunch was right. We should have gone away. - Dad, we couldn't do that. - Oh, it isn't fair to subject you to all this. I made a great mistake. - You let me be the judge of that. - Out one door and in the other. It's all so confusing. - Shh, shh. - I wonder what Cora meant by the "little house." - Could it be that little doll house you gave me one Christmas years ago? - That's possible. - We left it here. That might be where Aunt Cora hid the money. Dad, I'm going to find it. - But Gay, that money isn't ours. - I know it isn't, but it may lead us to the... - That's right. You stay here. I'll see if it's in the attic. (eerie orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (Gay screams) - Are you hurt? - She doesn't seem to be, just scared maybe. - What was it, Gay darling? Tell me what happened. First the old lady, then Ms. Palmer, now Grady. - Three down, five to go. - Gay, dear, are you all right? - Yeah. She'll be all right. - Grady. What happened to him? - When I turned around, he was coming down the stairs towards me. I'm sure he was going to kill me, and then suddenly, I saw a man's arm come from under the stairs and trip him. -Aman's arm? - Yes. - Whose was it? - I don't know. I couldn't see. It was dark. - Well, now we're really stymied. I counted on Grady's next false move to solve the other murders. - Well, that's solution enough for me. All the evidence in this case from the very beginning pointed to Grady. That should be a great relief to all of us. Now, I guess we can... - Now wait a minute, McGalvey. Aren't you taking the easy way out? Pinning the murders on a dead man? According to Ms. Elliot, there was a third party in this basement. Unless I miss my guess, that complicates matters even more. - Mr. Nichols is right. The cat which led us here has not yet pointed to the murderer. - Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but as far as I'm concerned, it has. - Of course, nobody ever asked me, but I've got a theory on this case. Now, if the cat were in the cellar, maybe the cat tripped Grady. - I can certainly tell the difference between a cat and a man's arm. - I don't think you're helping this case very much, Laurie. Of course, if you believe in superhuman cats... - I don't believe in Santa Claus, either, but I hang up my stocking just the same. Of course, if I were the guilty one, I'd knock that cat off but quick. - And we can do without another piano lesson. - Yes, definitely. - Okay. Can't understand these people don't appreciate good music. - Walter, I'm glad we're not in a courtroom. - What do you mean by that remark? - Well, simply this. I've seen men convicted on less evidence and it points to you. Now, you take the incident of your daughter being attacked and living to tell the tale. Now, that's one thing. I think a jury might agree that that could have happened. But when a second attempt IS made on her life and some mysterious stranger Intervenes and saves her, I'm afraid the long arm of coincidences has overreached itself. - You, too, Tom. I thought you were my friend. Surely, you don't... - I'm not accusing you of anything, Walter. All I know is that somebody killed Grady in order to protect your daughter. Now, who would be most likely to do that? - McGalvey, I'd like to see you take me to a courtroom on that. - I'm sorry, Walter. We're here 10 get the facts. - Please, Dad. Everything is going to be all right. - Yes, Mr. Elliot. Everything's gonna be all right, with the help of your friend, McGalvey. - He was my closest friend. And you Nichols, you were gonna marry my daughter. I don't think I have a friend left in this world. (foreboding orchestral music) - Well, McGalvey, it would seem that the long arm of coincidence is now pointing in your direction. - Yes. Follow the cat and you will find the guilty one. - Have you people lost your minds? Do I have to explain my presence here in the cellar? - Well, I thought you might want to McGalvey. After all, you're among friends. - Nobody asked Ms. Elliot what she was doing here. Was it the money, or did she come here because her father asked her to? - I came here in the hopes of finding something to solve these crimes. - That's exactly why I came here. It doesn't make any difference who discovers the murderer. Does it, Mr. Nichols? Now, if you don't mind, I'm getting a little tired making unnecessary explanations. - Very neatly side-stepped. - Maybe he won't always be so sure-footed. - You're doing all right, puss. Just got your signals crossed that time. That's all. Have another try at it. (tense orchestral music) (cat screeches) - I wouldn't do that, Mac. (dramatic orchestral music) (vase shatters) - No, no. Wrong door. Now we're even, Mac. Remember the summer house? - Put him over here, Pidge. You finally fell for the cat routine, didn't you Mac? Throw me a cigarette, Pidge. Okay. If you won't plead your case, at least you'll listen to the prosecution. It all started 15 years ago. Didn't have clients running for the Senate then, did you, Mac? Now, the newspaper files showed us your old clients ran whiskey. You see, pops, in those days, Mac was a mouthpiece for a gang of bootleggers headed by Goran. Oh, don't worry, Pidge. Kyra is not the bootlegger's daughter. That's just the part she plays in this little opus. He used your place here without your knowledge to unload and pay off. - I'll say it was without my knowledge. I never even suspected. - Mac was just small fry, until Goran got $200,000 for the big shipment. That's when he became a big time operator. He killed Goran for the money, but he made one mistake. Goran had already hidden the money. - [Walter] But Grady, where's he come in? - He must have known Matt killed Goran and held it over him. - He bled me white. He and that Palmer woman, paid off for them for years. Sure, I killed 'em. I killed 'em both. I'd have killed the lot of you, too, before I lose the money that I waited all these years to get. - Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay, honey, take the boat you came in and get to the mainland. Send back the cops. When you do, send back a pound of liver for that cat. She did a swell job, too, honey. - Uh, uh, uh. Don't mind that honey talk. Show business, doesn't mean a thing. - How can I ever thank you for all you've done? - Don't thank me, dear. Thank the cat. That cat sure saved the show. - Kyra, why didn't you tell me you were an actress? - You didn't ask me. - Say, were you ever in...? - Jersey? Sure. - Toots, I knew it. Wait, don't you remember me? I used to sit in the front row of the Follies every Saturday night and you used to lean over and you'd whisper, "Hi, you big eyes." Hey, boss. How about me going over to the mainland with her, huh? - Take it easy, Pidge. Her show doesn't open until next week. That's five nights away, big eyes. (Pidge chuckles) (Pidge whistles) Pidge, are you crazy? No woman is worth jumping out of the window for. - Look! Thousand dollars bills. And all the time I thought the money was in the dollhouse. I bet you thought I was gonna say it again. - Tell me something, Terry, that trained cat... did the actress bring it with her? - That's no trained cat, pops. It lives here. - Did some phenomenal things. - That cat didn't do anything that wasn't perfectly natural. It just wanted to get to its family. (kittens meow) Just as I'd expect Gay to do if Terry Patrick Francis Osfield Omal Vaney Nichols I'll was waiting for his dinner. (triumphant orchestral music)
