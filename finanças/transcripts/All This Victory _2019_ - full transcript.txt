Bassam, call Marwan right away. He's going to the South. Call him now. Can you pick me up from school? I will go in now. Take over please. Check what's missing. This group has nothing yet. Glad to see you. What's wrong? Marwan went to the South. Are you OK? I don't know. Give us a hand. It will take your mind off it. I don't think so. It's said that bridges are bombed for strategic military purposes. as these bombing are isolating the Southern villages and small towns. Sir! Sir! Is this road open? Is the road open? Yes, for now. Yes, Bassam. No, I'm still on my way. All is OK. Says who? No one said the truce is breached. Here all is fine. People are circulating. Bassam, what is it? You're irritating me. Fine, talk to her, calm her down. Tell her it's just a couple hours. I'm almost there. I'm trying to call him. He's not answering. Tell her it's just 2 hours. I'll pick him up and come back. That's it. OK. Who's there? I'm telling you again. He was here when his house got hit. And why is his cellphone there? Did you find anything? Yes, I found Marwan, Abou Nasser's son. What brings you here? I came to take my dad to Beirut. Where is he? I just told you. He left. You came to take Abou Nasser to Beirut? Are the roads safe? How and when did he leave? Kassem is here. Ask him. You know him better. When his house got bombed, he lost his tempers. When was that? Two days ago. And he left this morning? He left when we heard about the ceasefire. Maybe he passed first by Hassan's house. And you believed him? Marwan! Where is Hassan's house? Go show him. You told me he left. Follow him and stop chitchatting! Stop, stop, stop. Poor Hassan! We spoke. He insists he will be back quickly, don't worry. Where shall we go? Mom's house or my place? Take me home. You're not staying alone. You're coming with me. Let's be together. There is no one there. Kassem? Yes. Come, take over. Alright. Explain to me how he left. With whose car? Does Hassan have a car? If you could see Hassan's house. It is wiped out. Put it on 95. Wait a second. A bomb hit Hassan's car. They planned to walk until they find a ride. He should be in the mountains now. Which way did they go? Through Srifa? Nabatiyeh? You should also consider that he might still be here... because he was acting very weird. Very weird? What does it mean? He was standing here, looking at how the village was demolished. Nonsense. He was smiling. I saw him, you did not. For the first time, he wanted to join you in Beirut. Cut the nonsense. Smiling, he says! Nonsense... I hope he arrived to Beirut. Why didn't he call me? So I worry about him? I kept telling him to leave. Sit down. Stop saying nonsense. Calm down. The fighters will update us. What fighters? "The" fighters. Only they would know. They'll come and tell us. They'll leave the battle to update me on my dad? Dear... They always check on us. I don't know when. But they always do. Where are they now? We don't know. They're spread. Despite the temporary truce, the Israeli enemy has bombed. What? It's back? Is it over? Is the truce over? Hello? Rana? How is he getting coverage? Why would you care? Damn. Seems it's targeting the other end of the village. Please! Not my house again? This house was never hit. Enough already! Where to? Let's leave. Are you mad? You can't leave now. I'm mad? Are you crazy? Let's go. Who said we wanted to go? We'll leave in my car. Come! Let's go. Go search for your dad! Najeeb! It's getting dark. Let's go. Najeeb. Yes? My inhaler is nearly empty. What? You want to leave? It's our last chance. Let's go with him. Your inhaler's empty and you're sick? And he came specifically for his father. So leave! You want to leave, then just go! Then stay here alone like a dog! No! No! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! You are a man, I have kids. You can manage. Stop! Stop! How will I leave? Back to our live coverage. Abbas is our correspondent in Lebanon and he's now in Beirut airport. I wish they allowed him to get closer to the areas that were hit on some of the airport's runways. Over to you Abbas. Thank you! A while ago, the minister of transports, Mohamed Al Safadi, reached Beirut airport for a checkup. And as per what the minister shared, 10 bombs exploded on the runways. One didn't explode. 11 bombs were technically launched. Why haven't you left the village? Nobody expected a war like this one. We thought it would end in 2 to 3 days. Were you with my dad in the Resistance? Back in the days... "2 to 3 days" you say? You never left and you never will. What can you find here except death? This house has never been hit, neither in 1982 nor in 1993 nor in April. God willing, it won't be hit this time. You see me now as an old man. But when I used to carry arms, all of Israel used to fear me. I could hit a bird's eye... with my Kalashnikov. Stop acting silly. He has coverage. How come? No, my battery is dying. Don't you have a... a charger? Where would he plug it? In your ass? Shut up! Are those the fighters? What are you doing? We're in deep trouble this time. God help us. They are retaliating. Do you have a candle? Close the curtains. Marwan! Marwan! Marwan! Najeeb! Najeeb! Najeeb! Get in. You're still here? The fighters demanded we leave. It's your house's turn then? All I know is that we ran to get here. Good you're safe. Any news from your sister? The fighters asked you to leave? The bombing started. I thought it would be the end. The fighters came, told us to leave. I packed all I could and ran here with my wife. Who are you? Marwan, Abou Nasser's son. Oh... May he rest in peace! Poor Abou Nasser. What? They got ambushed while crossing the river. They were hit with twenty mortar shells. That blew them into pieces. Didn't you know? Who told you that? That's what I heard. People were talking. It's probably just rumors. Abou Nasser has probably already reached Beirut. You idiot! Why say things you're not sure of? This is what I heard. You had no idea about this. How could I know? You're a stubborn idiot! I told you I wanted to leave. Go to Beirut. You said the attack wouldn't last 2 days. Well, we're in trouble now. We'd be lucky if we survive. Lower your voice. I don't want to. Don't you tell me what to do from now on! Do you hear me? If this ever ends, I would be stupid to stay with you. I'm stuck here. I'll die in this village. Mohamad, please take me to see her. She's my only sister. Take me to her. We left her. You brought me here. I want to know if she's still alive or not. Please, let's check on her. I beg you, Mohamad. I want to be reassured. Marwan, come inside. We need to find a way out. I can't stay here. We will find a car. I'll hang white sheets on it. Come, let's talk inside. The drone is too close. It's dangerous out there. I have a request for our Arab brothers. We need today before tomorrow to have a unified and assertive Arab nation to vote for the Security Council Resolution that will result in a real step towards a permanent solution and preserve our political structure and internal stability. What's wrong with him? And all in due time. Our "Arabness" in Lebanon... Is he talking or crying? Is unconditional and not westernized. He is crying. He should be more poised. He's the Prime Minister! Its refusal to cease fire and decision to spread the attacks... Rana El Haber and Marwan Hamdan. Is your husband here? No, I am here on his behalf. He needs to retrieve his passport in person. I have... I have a Power of Attorney for that. It's not enough. Look at the line behind you. He needs to come personally. I can't give his passport to anyone. Please, I just want his passport. He really can't come. There's a lady here who wants to retrieve her husband's passport. He is not with her. We'll make an exception, madam, and hand both passports to you. Just because of the chaotic and complex current situation. Calm down. You can't go anywhere now. You think Africa was easy on any of us? Do you think that people went there, made a fortune and came back? Many got broke, and went back to square one. You can't blame your dad. He couldn't return. There were accusations against him. Being the military commander of the party wasn't easy. My dad wasn't a military commander. The party was brought down. No one could cover him. He paid the price. You don't know your dad well. I'm sure he managed to survive. He's not anyone! He's Abou Nasser! Pretend that you're dead. The WC window leads where? You can't remove its bars. I can! We have to leave. Let me hear what's going on. They are moving furniture to block the windows. It must be the fighters. They're firing randomly? They are giving their coordinates. They took over the village? What did they say? I can barely understand! Let me hear. They're saying that Gad has heart problems. Gad? Who is Gad? I don't know! One of them. Call the fighters. What is this? They will catch us on their radar! Why are you still carrying it? Give it to me. Don't turn it on. I have an idea. I will go upstairs and tell them we're unarmed. I'll say I'm pregnant... and you're old men. Old men? If we're old men, what about Marwan? Why drink if you'll pee your pants? Enough! Sabha! Sabha! Leave! Leave. They will kill you! Sabha leave, please! It doesn't show. There is nothing. I want to leave now. Ok, we'll leave. How come you understand Hebrew? I spent time in Israeli prisons. I have a PhD in Hebrew! We wanted to change the world. But we couldn't change our own village. Your father was more pragmatic. I wish you had left early on. We couldn't leave. What do you feel? What do you mean? Do you feel he's still alive? I don't know anymore. I've been confused about him for so long. You came for him. That's what matters. Blood is thicker than water. What are you doing? Don't shoot! Are you crazy yelling like that? You're endangering us. Our fighters know we're here. They know we're here. What did he say? Did they hit Beirut or Nabatieh? They are bombing both. That's all I understood. Did they occupy all the South? Occupy the South? Occupy my ass! They're baffled. Can't you see? If so, why all the shelling and firing? Don't worry! They won't bomb the house they're in. Are you sure they hit Beirut? What's going on? What is this? The box? What are they waiting for? They haven't seen it yet. What is this for? Where to? Move over. Stay here! Give it to me... No one moves! That's it! What if cluster bombs are inside? Inside, there is food and water. I promise that if we survive this, I'll take you wherever you want. Africa... we will go to Africa. We will travel together. And if you don't want to, we'll never come back. We will stay together. Just tell me what you want. The fighters know we're here. I'm sure they do. They know, they surely know. How would they know we're still here? How are they supposed to? Otherwise, who killed the Israeli soldier? Are you sure? They know we're down here? Yes, I'm sure. And they'll come for us. Found anything? Do you seriously think there's a tunnel? A tunnel? Yes, that's true. There are tunnels everywhere here. It's probably why the fighters didn't bomb the house yet. There are 6 soldiers upstairs. Six. One of them was killed. There are 6 left. They were lost. That's what they're saying. They were 50 soldiers... A bloodbath took place. A sword fell from the sky and cut off their heads. A very big sword. A huge one. It came down from the sky. This is Imam Ali's sword. God is almighty! Thank God! They saw riders on white horses riding from one mountain to another. God is Almighty! These are angels coming to save us! A white cloud invaded the air and blinded them. They couldn't see anything anymore. Then the fighters took them by surprise and killed most of them. The ones who escaped got lost... not knowing what to do. Where is your inhaler? It's empty. Did they really say all this? Yes, Hebrew is shorter than Arabic. What do you miss the most? It's nice to miss someone. Did they leave? I can't hear anything. Could they have gone? They left! They left! Joumana! Joumana! Joumana, come here! Joumana! Come back here. Joumana! I'm telling you get inside. Joumana! I beg you to come back here. Come to me! Come! Get your bags, we should go. We're leaving. We want to leave. Joumana, you go first, and I'll follow. We'll hold a white cloth. We'll say she's pregnant. I'll go first. Ok. Move. Najeeb. Move. Move away. We can't. Move. They're still up there. Enough! They're coming down.
