MAN'S VOICE: What would home look like? I don't know. A farmhouse in the valley, I guess, like the one we grew up in, Liza and I. I remember hiding in the orchard at night looking down at the lighted windows, waiting for our daddy to fall asleep just so we could go back inside. Do you remember that, Liza? Hmm? Do you remember that? I'd imagine him passing out with one of his Lucky Strikes in his hand, the house catching fire, the orchard, the whole valley burning up. So, how's it feel, Liza? Your first big score? I don't know. Excited, nervous, like I'm spying on someone, someone doing something dirty. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, I know what you mean. Shame. It's all right, little sis. It's a good sign when you feel a little bad. (CRASHES) MAN: Liza? Liza, can you hear me? - Liza? - I can hear you. Are you in pain? No. I think I'm all right. Theo? MAN: Theo should've worn his safety belt. Shit. (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) (RADIO CHATTER CONTINUES) - Radio 234, TA on Highway 131. (SIREN CHIRPS) Liza, can you move? I think so. - Then be ready to. - Okay. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (BIRD CAWING) Are you okay? Can you hear me? Sir, I hope you can forgive me. (GUNSHOT) Addison? Liza, get the money. Liza, now! See if you can get to your bag. Get anything warm. I'm sure that officer called for backup, at least an ambulance. We can't be foolish now, you understand? - Do you have the money? - Mm-hmm. Most of it. - Do you have your health? - I think so. Let's not dally. (DOOR CLANGS) (MEN CHATTERING) GUARD: Mills! Let's go. Pack it up. You're out of here. MAN: Yo, you be cool, white boy. - MAN 2: Yeah. MAN: - You be cool out there, man. - Yeah! - Come on, keep going! (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER P.A.) GUARD 2: You got your papers? You know how to get your car out of impound? I'm okay. Thanks. Going home to see your folks for Thanksgiving? I don't know. - Just let me out of here. (BUZZER SOUNDS) (BUZZER SOUNDS) (HORNS HONKING) (DISTANT SIRENS WAILING) MAN: Hello? Hello? Dad, it's Jay. Dad, are you there? Hello, son. How you been? Decent. Listen, I'm in the middle of something. I'll get your mother. WOMAN: Who is it? Hello? Mom, it's me. Oh! Oh, my goodness. Hi, honey! How are you? I'm out. - What? - This morning. Good behavior. Oh, my God. That's wonderful. Then you'll be here for Thanksgiving tomorrow? Oh! I'll make it nice, honey, just the way it used to be. What about Dad? Your father loves you, Jay. He just has a hard time showing it. Listen, if it's more comfortable tomorrow morning, he'll be gone hunting. We can talk about it then. I just need the keys to the cottage, if that's okay. Oh, sure. They're here. Just come and get them. Do you need money? Are you in trouble? Mom, I've got to go. MAN: Read the sign! Oh, shit. Jay. "Mohawk" Mills. Jay. Just Jay. Time really flies by. It didn't fly by for me. Well, come on in, kid. Just watching some tape on a new fighter. Yeah, you were really something then. No one threw a left hook harder. You weren't even there, Ronnie. How'd you end up with my medal? I just figured I'd hang on to it, you know, for safekeeping. Right. Looks good on you, kid. - When did you get out? - Couple of hours ago. Wow, you came straight here. I'm honored. Who tipped off the boxing commission, Ronnie? Hell if I know. Well, how come I was the only one that took the fall? How come you were never indicted? A lot of questions. I had a lot of time to think of them. I want the money you owe me. How do you figure I owe you money, kid? - The fucking fight, Ronnie! - Okay, I get it. Remember, kid, you were like a son to me. I don't got a lot right now, but I've got some. Some's better than none, right? It's not much, but it's all I got right now. (GROANING) - Are you fucking stupid? Do you think you can come in here and make demands? You're on parole! You don't dare touch me. You could've been a great fucking loser! We could've made a lot of money together. See, the way I figure, you owe me. Ronnie. Oh, Jesus. (RINGING) WOMAN: 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Hello? 9-1-1. Is anybody there? Stay on the line with me if you can hear me. We'll dispatch a car to this address. Jay? Hey, man! Long time no see! Hey. Sorry, man. Jay? Hey! - What's your problem? (ENGINE STARTS) MAN: Hey, watch it, man! JUNE: I told Jay to stop by tomorrow morning. I see. (SIGHS) Don't do this, Chet. It's not fair. He turned his back on his family. (HORN HONKS) JUNE: Wonder who that is. JUNE: - Hi, Hanna! - Hi! - Hi, Sheriff Mills. - Not me. - My spurs are hung. - Oh! It's so good to see you guys. - Seems like it's been forever. - Look at you. What a pretty young woman you turned into. You're the spitting image of your mom. I remember my mom and dad used to take me here for Thanksgiving when I was little. Jay and I used to always feed all those leftover bones and things to that big pig you guys had. Jay was always going on about... CHET: So, uh, what brings you out here now? Oh, um, we actually have a bad situation. I wanted to give you guys a heads up. What do you mean by bad? Late last night, one of the tribal casinos down in Mt. Pleasant was robbed. Two armed suspects wearing masks. Anyone hurt? Around 6:00 this morning, a state trooper came upon an accident site a ways south of us. And when backup arrived, they found the trooper shot to death. Oh, my God. One of the suspects died in the crash. At least one more took to the national forest here. We're setting up roadblocks and sending in search teams, but it is possible he could slip through, so we're just letting all the families out here know. Well, it's a huge area. He'd never make it this far north on foot. And the temperature's supposed to keep dropping. I heard blizzard conditions. I say let him freeze to death. Coyotes will find him. (BIRD CAWING) What are you looking at, Addison? Pardon me. It's okay to look. Hush! The devil will hear you. What did I promise you when we started this? That no one would get hurt. Well, I want you to remember this... you didn't hurt anyone. I made the choice, and now things are different. Different how? We're going to split up. They don't know anything about you. - You were just a distraction. - I don't like this plan. - I didn't ask you if you liked it. - We shouldn't split up! Shh! Listen. You follow that path and then cut toward the road. Use your wits. Hitch a ride. Keep heading north. We can still make it to Canada. But till then, you don't know me any more. I'm not your brother any more, not until I let you know it's okay. Remember how I taught you? Leave your phone on, and I'll call you tonight, okay? You're my little girl. Say it. I'm your little girl. That's good. Here you go. What if you don't call? Well, then I'm dead. HANNA: So do you have any plans for Thanksgiving? JUNE: No, just dinner. How about you? Any news from your mom, Hanna? - You? - No, sweetie. Not in a long time. Well, it was really good to see you. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, you should stop by tomorrow for dinner. Oh, thanks. You know, I... I was going to ask my dad if he had any plans, see if he wanted to do something together. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. (CHATTER, PHONES RINGING) Hey, Doris! What's the word? The word is shit, and there's a big pile of it waiting for you in the office. - Becker? - And the boys. Any mail come for me? A letter? Didn't come in yet. - Well, let me know. - Yes, ma'am. We'll provide manpower and additional search support along with the other counties. Shut the fucking door, eh? State K-9 teams won't be here till late tonight, so we're going in this afternoon with my dogs. Use your radios, use your heads. Everybody wears their vests. If you come upon this guy, call it in. We all want to make it home for turkey dinner. Well, you keep talking, I'm not going to make it for turkey dinner. Travis, this morning while you were fucking that little rat you call a wife, this guy shot a cop in the face. The cop's name was Alan Townsend. He served as a trooper for 18 years. That man is dead, gone forever. All right, all right. Take it easy. Sorry. This is the real deal, boys. You understand? All right, now listen up. Here's what we're going to do. Travis, Brice, Bill, you'll be with me heading west from the accident site toward the lake shore. The other four of you will be led by Denny. You'll head east toward I-75. Okay? Let's get going, What about me? What about you? - What team am I with? - None. - What do you mean? - I mean you ain't going out. - You can't do that. - I'm responsible for these men's lives. I'll do whatever the hell I see fit. Besides, what if we got out there and something major happened, like you had to change your tampon? (CHATTER STOPS) - No offense, Deputy. Then I'd change it, Dad. (CHATTER RESUMES) Shit. (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) Coroner's going to probably be done in about five minutes. - Okay. - Check in with him, will you? Shit! Miss. - Miss, are you okay? (SHIVERING) Hey, hey. Are you all right? (HEATER BLOWING) MAN: Come on, old pain! Ah, you no good mule! Start, God damn you! (ENGINE SPUTTERS) - You rotten old pile of shit! (GRUNTS) (ENGINE STARTS) - Ha! (SCREAMING) I have a past wife that comes to me in dreams. She told me you'd be coming. (GROANING, SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) LIZA: You can barely see anything out there. - Yeah. It's going into white-out. - What? When you can't see what's right in front of you. My car broke down. I got lost. You live around here? My folks. They live close to the border. I'm just passing through. You think you could give me a lift? No. I'm sorry. I can't. I'll drop you at the next gas station, all right? (UNZIPS) This is kind of like an old movie, don't you think? What is? Us. Two people meeting in a snowstorm. I guess. What's your name? What do you want it to be? Come on, didn't you ever play pretend when you were a kid? We're strangers. We can be whoever we want. So, who am I? - Come on, give me a name. - Look, I'm sorry. - I really don't... - Shh. Name me. Patricia. I like that. Patricia, the bad girl. (PHONE RINGING) (KNOCKING) The FBI Academy! You passed the exam! I'm so damn proud of you, honey. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Hanna, you're going to be an FBI agent and you're finally getting to leave this shit hole. Turn around and look at me. He's a son of a bitch, Hanna. - Who? - Who do you think? The sheriff, your dad! No. He's not that bad. He doesn't really mean it, you know? It's just been hard for him since my mom took off. That was years ago, Hanna. You're not actually considering giving this up? Why? So you can take care of him? I'm all he's got left. This is from my heart, honey. This is your life, and you only get one. (ENGINE SPUTTERING) (ENGINE DIES) (GRUNTING) (PULL CORD WHIRRING) (SIZZLES) - Ah! (SIZZLING) (SCREAMING) (HISSING) (GASPING) (CHATTER) (MUSIC PLAYING ON JUKEBOX) Well, good luck. Thanks for rescuing me. Hey, folks. Just to let you know, state police were just here. - They're closing the roads. - Are you serious? Full-on blizzard. Plows can't get through till the morning. So batten down the hatches and pull up a stool. You're probably going to be here all night. I know I will. - You got a phone? - Oh, yeah. Pay phone's in back by the can. (TOUCH-TONES BEEPING) (CHILDREN BABBLING) Hey, it's me. I'm at this place. I'm stuck here for the night. There's this guy. He's the perfect ride. His parents have a place near the border. I'm going to get him to take me there. The address is 207 Old Mills Farm Road, Bear Lake. Can you make it there? I hope you're okay. Okay. Bye. Hey, can I get you a drink? - I'm okay. - Ah, first one's on me. Call it a snowstorm special. You and your wife? Oh, we'd love a drink. Thank you. You're welcome. Here you go. My name's Patricia. This is my husband Addison. Addison? That's a funny one. It's his daddy's name. You two married long? No. We're pretty new at it. Ah, thought so. Still got the glow. Well, my name's Mandy and this is my bar. Got it in the divorce. Never used to come in here when he ran the place, - but now I love it. WOMAN: - Hey, Mandy! Now, how about bringing us some more pitchers, huh? My ex-sister-in-law Tricia. Listen, honey. You can pick the guy. You just can't pick the family. (WHISTLING) (COUPLE ARGUING) (ARGUMENT CONTINUES) (GLASS SHATTERS) (WOMAN SHOUTS) (MAN SHOUTING) (WOMAN CRYING) Come here! Come to Mommy! Come here! - Lisa, get back here! - Stop it! No! MAN: - No! WOMAN: - Lisa, come. (BABY WAILING) WOMAN: - Come here, baby. Come here, come here. No, stop it! MAN: Lisa, you get your ass back in the cabin if you know what's good for you! Come to Mommy. Come to me. - No. No! - That goes for your mother, too, or I'll be hunting more than deer tomorrow! You're not going anywhere! There's nothing for miles! That baby's going to freeze! I'll be waiting! WOMAN: - No! (BABY WAILING) (CRYING) Don't you move. Take your coat and go outside. - Who are you... - Shut your mouth! Liza, get outside now. Her name's Lisa. She only does what I tell her. You'll be dead before your hand touches it. Lisa, your mom's up on the hill with the baby. She's very cold and she needs your help. You need to take her something warm. You stay right there, Lisa. He ain't got the guts to do it in front of you. Probably wouldn't be good for a little girl seeing her stepfather killed. Later in life, I mean. I want my mom. She's up on the hill with the baby. - You're fucking my wife, is that it? - Lisa, leave now. (WHIMPERS) - Shh. Is that who you are, huh? I knew it. I fucking knew it! Go ahead! You can have her, the little fucking slut! Fuck you! - Fuck you... (GUNSHOTS) So, tell me something about you, Addison. What do you want to know? I don't know. What do you do for a living? Why are you always so serious? Anything. (CLEARS THROAT) I was a boxer, but it seems like a long time ago now. Like a boxer in the ring boxer? Mm-hmm. Yeah, my dad trained me since I was a kid. Got me all the way to the Beijing games. Wow, you must have been really good. I won the silver medal. - Is that it? (LAUGHING) You have it on you? I don't usually, but I happen to be today. Can I... Wow! (GASPS) That is really cool. It ain't the gold, but... It's amazing. I've never been good at anything. Here we go. You're going to have to help. Carry the baby. This boy needs you, okay? He can't make it without you. Here you go. Lisa, you can help your mom and the baby by getting in here and getting under the covers and cuddling up. There you go. Cuddle up real tight, while I have a think for a minute. You know, Lisa, I'm trying to imagine how you must feel. I think it would be a complicated feeling. I guess right now nothing in the whole world seems safe. Your stepdaddy's gone. Your mom's sick. And you're in the forest with a stranger. Ah! What happened to your hand? Well, I got into a fight with a great Indian chief. He cut my finger off. Did you kill him? Yes, I did. Are you going to kill me? No. You're a child. Children should be protected. Angels protect me. Maybe that's how you should think of me. I'm like an angel come down from the storm to remove that man from your life. ? Which one is left ? ? Which one's in heaven ? ? Love ? ? It's easy come, it's easy go... ? Once you're up at this cottage of yours all by your lonesome, what then? I don't know. I just need to think for a while, you know? I couldn't stand that. I hate being alone. It scares me, always has. If you still want it, I'll give you a lift to the border. I wish you hadn't stopped for me. I wish somebody else had come along. I wish I was somebody else. ? Love ? ? It's easy come, it's easy go ? ? Love... ? Just pretend, okay? I'm not pretending. Fuck me, Addison. ? 'Cause never mind ? ? 'Cause after all ? ? Love, love, love... ? (GASPING) So, what do you want to be when you grow up? A nurse. Grandma Vicky is a nurse. I always wanted to be a farmer. We had a fruit farm. Peaches mostly. But my daddy was a drunk and he ran it into the ground. When I was a kid, I always wanted to fix it up and farm it just right. (BABY FUSSING) Can I change the baby? Yeah. Liza (ON PHONE): Hey, it's me. I'm at this place. I'm stuck here for the night. There's this guy. He's the perfect ride. His family lives near the border. I'm going to get him to take me there. The address is 207 Old Mills Farm Road, Bear Lake. Can you make it there? You'll make a great nurse. I have a baby sister. When we were kids, I used to take care of her, just like you are. Where is she now? She's out there somewhere. I think you should leave your sister alone. (CHATTER) It's about Amy, my daughter. - You know her. - Sure. She was a couple of years ahead of me at school, but sure. Please. Then you know she's always been afraid to be without a man in her life. It's probably because of her dad and I. We never... Please, Mrs. Woodward, tell me what happened. She didn't come home last night. She was supposed to come to my house... she and the kids and her husband Bobby. He's a horrible man, a violent man. Do you know him? We've had calls to their house on a few occasions. Well, she was going to ask him for a divorce yesterday. - Did you try calling? - No. They were at Bobby's hunting cabin. There's no phone there. There's no nothing, and it's out in the woods. Could you please check on her? Make sure... just tell me everything's all right. Make me feel like a silly old mother. Sure. I'll be home around noon, unless I'm tracking one. - Hey. - Yeah? You've been pretty quiet this morning. - You okay? - Yeah. You know, parenting isn't easy, Chet, not for anyone. You make it look that way. Well, just because I'm better at hiding the hard parts. And you're always graceful. In case you get hungry. I thought you said your spurs were hung. It's better to have and not need. Okay, then. Stay warm. Don't tell me what to do. (JUNE LAUGHS) (DIALING) It's getting light out. Where are you? Are you still alive? I think I'd feel it if you died. I mean, at least I think I would. I feel like I just have to... I have to keep moving. Addison? (SOBBING) Everything is just... everything's getting so confusing. That guy I told you about, he turned out to be a real jerk. He just disappeared on me, so... (SNIFFLES) I'll find another way, and I'll call you. Or you call me. Where are you? Okay. Bye. (LIZA LAUGHING) (CHATTERING) Hey! Hey! Hey, buddy. What's your problem? I'll put you in a fucking coma! Drive the fuck away! - What are you doing? - What does it look like? - Last night was fun and all, but... - But what? - But it was just a game! - That is bullshit and you know it. Do I? You don't even know my name. So tell me. What does it matter? I could've been anybody. It matters to me. Why are you doing this? (URINATING) (GROANS) Hey, Bill, you order breakfast? - Come on, Travis. (ZIPPER ZIPS) What are you doing here, Hanna? Becker will have your head. Vicky Woodward is worried about her daughter. Their cabin's a couple of miles from here. Where's Becker? Headed north about an hour ago to meet with the state police. TRAVIS: You want us to come with you? Not necessary. No, it probably is. (ENGINE REVVING) (MOUTHS WORDS) LIZA: When I was 10, I watched my father bleed to death in the weeds beside our house. He pulled himself across the yard with his arms, screamed at me, and then he died. Someone shot him. Want to know what I did next? Washed him off with the garden hose, combed his hair, sat beside him and waited for someone to find me. Who found you? My brother. He turned off the hose and took me for a walk. What happened then? A lot of strangers at our house, a lot of cops. People trying to figure out where to put me. My father was a monster. An animal. And he died like one. I'm supposed to be a grownup. If I was someone else, I could have a husband of my own, be having my own babies. Instead I'm all messed up. Liza. My name is Liza. I'm Jay. ? Light shines off rivers ? ? Flowing through ? ? Every part of me wanting every part of you ? ? Soft and simple veins make a stain ? ? And find a drain ? ? If I was the one ? ? Maybe I could feel your pain ? ? And the water boils while the night is on fire ? ? I patiently wait like a bird on a wire. ? What's the matter, Hanna? Why are we stopping? Guys, it looks like this was left here. - Strange, huh? - So what? (SNOWMOBILES APPROACHING) - Becker, do you copy? - Hey, hey, what are you doing? I'm calling it in to Becker for backup. Calling in what? It's a snowmobile and a hunting cabin. While the two of you have your little spat, I'm just going to go and do my job. - We have to check it out. - Okay, fine. So we check it out, but don't go calling Becker now for nothing. Me and Brice are the ones who are gonna end up in deep shit. Becker told us to call. I'm calling. Becker, do you copy? What the hell? - You can't do that! - Can't do what? Such an asshole. Hello! Bobby? Hello? (SHOTGUN CLICKS) - It's the sheriff's office. Hello! You're going to get us in trouble, Hanna. I know it's early. We'd just like to have a quick word. Oh, my God. BRICE: Hello? Brice! Get away! It's him! (GUNSHOT) TRAVIS: - Brice? (BABY CRYING) (GASPS) - You're no angel at all. No, I am not. TRAVIS: Brice, you all right? Christ! Hanna, get down! TRAVIS: Come on! Oh, fuck! (GUNSHOT) (GRUNTING) - You all right? You're not even supposed to be here, Hanna! God damn it, Travis! (GRUNTS) (GROANING) (SNOWMOBILE APPROACHING) (GUNFIRE) Travis! (COUGHS) LIZA: You know this is my first snowman? You're shitting me. Ha, not a lot of snow in Alabama. One night when I was a kid, the Northern Lights were out and my dad and I made these snowmen out in the pasture like a boxing match... two snow fighters throwing punches. I remember I didn't want to go to bed that night. My dad carried me all the way back to the house. When I got down off the podium in Beijing, he was so fucking proud of me. And then later in the dressing room, I told him I was leaving home to go pro. I said to him... I said if I had a real coach, maybe I'd have won the gold. He still love you? Yeah, I guess, but... Well, you're lucky. You should see him. If I was going to see him, I'd like to introduce you. It's Thanksgiving. That's standard procedure. You don't want me there, Jay, seriously. I seriously do. What about Patricia? Isn't she going to be there? Who? Now, don't tell me there's no Patricia. Who is she to you? (SIGHS) I'd rather not talk about her. It's kind of personal. I think I've told you some personal things, Jay. - Miss December. - What? Patricia is Miss December. "Playboy", Christmas issue. She's a centerfold? A nudie picture? (LAUGHING) And did you two have a meaningful relationship? - We did. (LAUGHING) She was very understanding, not too demanding. And were you... were you faithful to her, Jay? I was. She was my one and only. She never let me down. Hey, lovebirds! Roads are open! And to answer your question, she probably won't be at Thanksgiving dinner at my parents' house. Good. Bitch better stay clear. Guys! Dad, I think I shot him. I think he's wounded. He's wearing a buckskin jacket with a blackbird or an eagle. At least I think it's an eagle on the back... BECKER: Just shut your mouth. - Dad! - I said shut your mouth! I told you to stay out of the woods! You see what happens when you stick your nose in? People start dying! Where's Travis? Afield, about 10 miles west. He's dead? If you were one of my boys, I would hit you so fucking hard. If I were one of your boys, you'd be proud of me. (DOG BARKING) I want everybody the hell out of here. All of you. You hear me? - But I can help... - All of you! (DOGS BARKING) Shut up! (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) Chester Mills, you'd better not be - walking in here with your boots... ADDISON: - Shh. What's your name? June. June, put that pan down, please. (TURNS OFF RADIO) Is there anyone else in the house, June? No. Step down and take a seat. Who might come home, June? My husband... - Chet. - Where is he? Deer hunting. He'll be armed? With a rifle. Why are you so calm? A panicking woman is no help to anyone. I like you, June. You do as I say, and I won't hurt you or your family. Thank you. Would you mind op... opening a window, please? May I take a look at that? Are you my mother? I'm somebody's mother. Ah, shit! You'll live. Well, that remains to be determined, June, but thank you. Do not turn around. Do exactly what I say. Slowly put your hands on your head, interlocking your fingers. To do that, I'd have to take my hand off the gun I have pointed at June on the table, which isn't going to happen. He will shoot you, kiddo. I don't think he will. Don't try me, son. No. He has too much to lose. Sir, believe me when I say that I genuinely like June. So, for both of us, would you please back down? God damn it. Open the rifle action and put the gun on the floor. (RIFLE CLICKS, BULLET CLINKS) Take a seat beside your wife. I'm sorry. Nothing to be sorry for. Chet, is it? How was the hunting? You know, when I was a kid, we had a Springfield 20 gauge. We used to hunt ducks and coons. You bake pies from scratch, June. For Thanksgiving I do. Oh, that's right. It's Thanksgiving. Would it be all right if we went ahead and served dinner? It'd be really nice to have a good meal. - Are you out of your fucking mind? - I would like that. - Honey... - Chet, we have to eat. It will occupy us. Keep things from getting too crazy. Thank you, June. Don't thank me. Chet shot the goose. Well, thank you, Chet. LIZA: What are you looking for? Nothing. I'm just, uh... Wondering if the police are waiting for you? I know what people are like when they're on the run. I fucked up. It wasn't my fault, but... I'm not going back to prison. I can't. Is it safe? Who's that, June? Oh, my God. It's our son. It's Jay. ADDISON: Well, well, well. Careful. The steps are icy. - Hey, Mom. - Jay. On, Jay. - I brought a guest. - Jay, listen to me. There's a man in our house and he has a gun. Don't! Don't do anything. He'll hurt your dad. Please just... just come in, both of you. Dad, you okay? I'm okay, son. Good afternoon. You must be Jay. What do you want? And this must be your wife. - She's my friend. (CHUCKLES) Well, I think the lady can speak for herself. What's your name? Liza. Well, that's a nice name. Take a seat. Both of you. The goose should be done soon. Is that correct, June? - Yes. - Great. I don't know about you all, but I'm famished. Chet, here. Have some wine. Take it away from me. It's going straight to my head. I need some food and I need some sleep. Besides, it's Thanksgiving. Are you testing me, Jay? Because that would be a terrible idea. (DOG BARKING) (SOBBING) Becker (ON RADIO): This is Sheriff T. Becker, requesting the state police crime scene unit and county coroner. And be advised we're losing daylight and must stay on the suspect?s trail. HANNA: Happy Thanksgiving, Mom. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Yeah, this is the sheriff's office. Hanna Becker speaking. Sure. Detective Frank Mack, Detroit Police Department. Say that again? Oh. Yeah, I know the family. I know where they live. A concussion? So you need his statement. Got it. I'll go over there. I'll let you know. Happy holiday to you, too. Jesus Christ. June, do you say grace at Thanksgiving? We give thanks. And how does that work? We all go around, say something we're thankful for. An excellent idea. Would you mind starting? Please? I'm thankful for this food, for God's charity, and for giving me His two greatest men, my husband and my son. Well said. Chet, you're next. I'm thankful for June, the love of my life. (LAUGHS) Wow, that was sweet, Chet! How about your son? What's wrong with him, hmm? Let's ask him. Jay, what are you grateful for? It's none of your fucking business. No, you're missing the point, Jay. Well, I'm not going to give you anything. - Jay, it's your turn. - Addison, please stop. These people haven't done anything to you. You best watch your mouth, little girl. Don't you forget where you belong. Give thanks, Jay. And you'd better say something I know you really mean. You think I'm afraid of you? Look at you. You're nothing without that gun. What if this is your daddy's last moment of life? What do you want him to take with him? Jay. Please, honey. (CRYING) I'm sorry, Dad. I messed everything up so bad. That fight, they told me it was the only way they'd give me a shot at the title. I laid down. I let him beat me. I don't deserve to be sitting at your table. This is your table, son. And you're not the only one who messed up. (SIREN WAILING) Once again, June, the goose was really quite wonderful. What are you going to do? I'm going to have some more red wine. I'm going to have some more of your wife's homemade pie. About the police. I don't know, Chet. I feel pretty good just sitting here. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey, it's Hanna. Hanna Becker. We know that officer. She's a friend of the family. Just dropping by on Thanksgiving? - I invited her. - That slip your mind, June? (KNOCKING) Ask her in. No. Do it. Come on in, Hanna. Hey, everybody. Sorry to interrupt. I don't think you know everyone. - This is... - I'm the killer. The one you're all looking for. I'm sorry, Hanna. I didn't know what to do. I wouldn't either. Give me your belt. Take a seat. Go on. June, would you please serve some pie? Do you want pumpkin or apple? I'm going to have pumpkin. Seems more appropriate for the holidays. So, Hanna, what are you doing here? Thank you. It's Thanksgiving. Don't you got anybody of your own? I'm here for Jay. Hey. - Long time. - Yeah. I got a call from a detective in Detroit. He needs to talk with you. ADDISON: Whoops. You in trouble with the police, Jay? That's kind of embarrassing for your folks. I mean, this all seems pretty wholesome. What went wrong, buddy? What are they after you for? I'm dying to know. I have something I'd like to give thanks for. What's that? My brother. Why? Because when we were little, he protected me when I couldn't protect myself. I was so young. He thinks I can't remember, but I remember all of it. The sound of the gun, the blood on my shoe. My brother killed the devil. He saved me from hell, and I am forever thankful. I love him so much for it. But now I need a... I need a chance. I need a chance at my own life, and I want my brother's blessing. I need him to please let me go. Eat. Eat! (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) Hmm. You two in love? You think he loves you? Do you think he loves you? Look at me. Look at me! - Don't fucking touch her! - Sit! You put your hand on the table where I can see it. (SCREAMING) - Stop it! Stop it! Sit down! Sit, June, sit! God damn you to hell. Addison, please. Come on, let's just go. - Just you and me. - No, baby. Come on, let's go right now. Come on. - We're way past that now. - I'm your little girl. No. Please. Did you fuck her, Jay? Did you? You think he cares about you? You look at your boyfriend now. - Look at him! - Please, God, no! You look at your family. You look what you've done! Huh? (ON RADIO) This is Sheriff T. Becker requesting immediate backup. I'm going into the Old Mills Farm, Mills Farm Road off county line 55. Possible manhunt suspect on premises, described as wearing a deerskin jacket with an eagle emblem, possibly wounded. DISPATCHER: Copy that. Units en route. Be advised not to engage until backup... (GRUNTING) Shh. (GUNSHOT) (SCREAMING) Dad, the living room. Happy Thanksgiving. I'm glad you could make it. (JUNE SCREAMING) Don't! - Please don't! - Ah! (SCREAMS) - No! (GUNSHOT) (ROARING) (GASPING, WHEEZING) LIZA: Jay! Please! Please. He's my brother. (GASPING) - You love her, Jay? (DISTANT SIREN WAILING) Do you love her, Jay? Yes, I do. (GUNSHOTS) OFFICER: Sheriff Mills! To the right! OFFICER 2: - You take the girl. Go! OFFICER 3: - I got her. (CRYING) Addison... Ma'am. Ma'am. Get him out of here! Ma'am, I need you to get back. Please, I need you to get back. Ma'am. Get an ambulance! Come on. That's it. That other officer, the sheriff, wasn't wearing a vest. He's in rough shape. Do you know who his next of kin is? ADDISON'S VOICE: What would home look like? I don't know. A farmhouse in the valley, I guess, like the one we grew up in, Liza and I. (FOLK MUSIC PLAYING) ? All of my trains ? ? They all roll on by ? ? Now and again ? ? I remember who I am ? ? Well, I woke outside to three's a crowd ? ? The sun above was festering down ? ? Drew my eyes open like ash ? ? Chimney smoke through blades of grass ? ? And put on my black work horse boots ? ? And headed past the business suits ? ? Past water lilies over streams ? ? Rivers brown as coffee beans ? ? Pistol visions in my hands ? ? I wanna see my blood across the sand ? ? Morning always looked like you ? ? Morning always looked like you ? ? From my window the only view ? ? Is you walking away, not looking ? (VOCALIZING) ? All of my trains ? ? My life spent away ? ? In the dark of my veins ? ? Oh, nothing could stay ? ? I continued through a backlit world ? ? Where the willows bent like long black curls ? ? Down your face from mine ? ? Through the kinks in your spine ? ? From the last thing we spoke to the very first line ? ? Love is something that we couldn't help but do ? ? That something turned to someone else ? ? Somebody new ? ? I just loved to love and you loved to cry ? ? I meant it through each second ? ? That we said good-bye ? ? And I came up past a station ? ? Where the floors were all blue ? ? Something 'bout the way it looked ? ? Reminded me of you ? ? It might have been how far I'd come ? ? So I dropped a match until the floor was gone ? ? All of my trains ? ? I let them all go ? ? All of my trains ? ? I let them all go ? ? All of my trains ? ? I let them all go ? ? All of my trains ? ? Then I lit the thread across the station door ? ? Kentucky Straight, I hit the floor ? ? The station tussled up in flames ? ? But I could only read the bottle's name ? ? And I waned its breast and turned it dry ? ? Like the wake of summer from July ? ? Got up and tripped over my knees ? ? Which caved in at the slightest breeze ? ? Morning always looked like you ? ? Morning always looked like you ? ? All of my trains ? ? I let them all go ? ? All of my trains ? ? I let them all go ? ? All of my trains ? ? I let them all go ? ? All of my trains ? ? I thought you should know ? ? I thought you should know ? ? All of my trains ? ? I let them all go ? ? All of my trains ? ? I let them all go ? ? All of my trains ? ? I thought you should know. ?
