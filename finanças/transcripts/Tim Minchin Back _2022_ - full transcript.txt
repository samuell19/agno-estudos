Audience member 3: Whoo! I've been... I've been playing that f sharp song for about 18 years now, on and off, and over the years I've noticed that the audience reactions to the song can be distributed like so many things across a bell curve, across a normal distribution curve, where, at one end of the curve, a small minority of you, presumably musicians and musician-adjacent people who just think it's the funniest fucking thing they've ever heard in their lives. - And then the bell of the curve is, of course, the majority of you and your reactions are kind of like... And then the other end is another minority, three or four percent of you are just, like, "why are we laughing? It sounds fine." -It's gonna be a long night for you tone-deaf motherfuckers. The show's called back, 'cause I'm... 'Cause I'm back, I suppose. There you are. Er, it's called back, because I suppose... I don't know if you knew this, but after my orchestra show, I just... I retired from touring for, like, seven years, and then when I put this on sale in 2019 or whatever, I thought I'll call it back, because, I guess from the point of view of you guys, the consumers of my logical philosophy lectures disguised as cabaret shows, I guess I'm "back". Er, from the point of view of my children, of course, I'm... I'm “back" to being an absent father. It was a tough one, this one, actually, coming on tour again. I left Sydney, where I live now, about eight weeks ago to start this tour, and, er, I'd, like so many of us, I'd spent the vast majority of the last 18 months at home with the kids, and my kids are in their early teens now. So, this time, me leaving was a big deal. There were a lot of tears, and it was really... It was really hard. You know? It's awful and, um... Yeah, in the eight weeks since I've been away, I've been thinking about them a lot, you know, and I've just been thinking, "fuck 'em." Seriously, I gave up touring for seven years for those little cunts, and do they... do they clap and cheer when I walk into a room? Do they? Fuck! I have come to the conclusion that I love you guys more than I love my children. And I feel incredibly comfortable with that realisation. I would like to wash and powder the perineums of each and every one of you. Uh... The, um... The tour has a subtitle. It's called "back: Old songs, new songs, fuck you songs", because it rhymes and it has a swear word, and if you don't think that's utterly brilliant, you're also going to have a fucking long night, because that is pretty much the sum total of my skill set... - Rhyming and swearing. Swearing and rhyming. Getting about in age-inappropriate trousers. - Oh, fuck. And now, oi, yeah, so the next song I'm going to do is the oldest of the old songs category. And it's not, to be honest, actually a song. It's a poem, a beat poem, that I wrote in 1999, and it's called mitsubishi Colt. Ah. I've noticed this phenomenon, actually. I'd be interested to know if you picked up on this, just since I started touring again. Have you guys noticed that there are adults, like, grown-ups these days, like, fully grown adult human sapien beings who are, like... who can buy drinks, and a car, and, like, adopt children, and have a gun and shit, like, grown-ups, who were born in or after 2000 ad. Have you heard about this shit? Are there any in the audience tonight, people born in... Okay. All right. That's fucking gross. Okay? That's not... That's not okay. I want you to know that you are not welcome here. - And I don't mean in this theatre, I mean on the fucking planet. It's really obnoxious. You wandering around, shining a spotlight on the inexorable onward march of time. Fuck you, man. "Ooh, look at my musculoskeletal system, still holding up my body weight without pain. Ooh.“ "I'm sitting in a chair. It doesn't hurt." Fuck you guys. You'll probably go home tonight and have wobble-free sex. With your little boyfriend whose penis probably still hangs lower than his scrotum. Anyway, for you guys, a mitsubishi Colt is a car, okay? It's just a shitty little car, built and designed in the empire of Japan in the century before your consciousnesses burst miraculously into existence. They don't, by the way, exist, your consciousnesses. Consciousness is just an emergent property of any sufficiently complex neural network, and the self is an illusion built on fear. Anyway, you will catch up. So, anyway, this... this poem's about... It's not... It's called mitsubishi Colt, but it's not actually about a car. The poem is about this situation I used to get in. I'm sure if there are any young artists... You know when you're struggling, if you're a struggling artist, this thing happens, where, if a rich person comes to see your gig or look at your paintings or whatever, if they're ever trying to be nice to you, it always comes across as horribly condescending. So I wrote a poem about this scenario, and I played it for a while, and then I had to stop playing it for, like, ten years because it got really awkward, because I'm... Quite, rich now... It's very, very embarrassing. But don't worry, I'm getting through it. But then, um... Then I moved back to Australia. I lived overseas for, like, 12 years, 13 years. And four years ago, I moved back to Sydney. And, I swear, half a dozen times since I moved back to Australia, I've had some suit come up to me and do that, "so what do you do, mate?" I'm, like, "I'm a musician". “Oh, a musician, are ya? You make a living out of that, do ya?" "Fucking hell, mate, I could buy your child." But I don't, because it's illegal, as it turns out. Anyway, what I'm trying to say for you youngsters is throughout the evening there might be some terminology that you struggle with because you're young and ignorant. But also because some of it was written before you were born, so there'll be a bit of a glossary of terms throughout the night so you don't fall behind. But, erm, for this one, there's not much. There's... at one point, yeah, the antagonist refers to a "chick" magazine, er, which is like an obnoxious way of talking about a girlie magazine. So, erm, a magazine is like a, um... Er, how would you des... It's like a large-scale floppy, shiny, book-based thing. A book is, erm, well, how would you describe it? A book is like... Like a tightly-bound stack of very thin slices of tree that you entertain... It's like tiktok, but it doesn't make you mentally ill. Anyway, a girly magazine is what we used to do for porn. And I know you guys can't even imagine a world in which you don't have the planet's most perverse peccadillos playing in high definition video in your pocket 24/7. Back in our day, our porn was still. And we used to have to search for it in the sand dunes behind the drive-in, For some reason I still don't understand. A drive-in is like a massive iPhone. Like, picture a huge iPhone. And you back your car up to it, and you pop the boot, and lie there, and try not to get distracted by the voice of Harrison Ford coming through your car stereo while you try to finger your sister's best friend. It's complicated. It's hard to describe. Now I say it out loud, it doesn't seem likely. I can't believe I'm doing old-person jokes. 'Cause I just want to die quite soon. Right. Mitsubishi Colt. So this is a beat poem. For those interested, everything I do with my hands while I'm doing this poem, is improvised, okay? I'm telling you that so you're more impressed if I succeed, and more forgiving if I fuck it up.

And I realised, in hindsight, that I garnered a reputation for being quite outspoken about, um... Erm, re... Jesus and religion, and stuff. Um... And that is, like... That's fantastic. Like, honestly, I'm just thrilled if anyone comes to watch this shit for any reason. But it did kind of come to my attention that some people were coming very much for that material, and that was what I was known for. And I don't want anyone to be disappointed. So, I just want to make it clear from the outset that I'm not... Don't be waiting for... I'm not really doing that stuff any more. - Um... - Audience: Aw! Yeah, I know. It's sort of a pity, but I just think I've matured, you know? And also, actually, to be honest, the real reason is because I had a bit of a revelation, a sort of damascene moment, if you will. But, unlike Saul of tarsus, who had his revelation on the road to Damascus, I had mine in a pub in dandenong? So, for those who don't know, dandenong is an outer suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, in Australia. And I was sitting at this table in this pub, and a bloke came up to me. Now, one of the side effects of being outspoken about religion in public is that members of the public feel quite free to be outspoken about religion back to me in public, which is totally as it should... That's totally fine, but I've got quite good at seeing it coming. And I could tell this guy was one of these... You know, he had a cross around his neck, to be fair... But also he just had that... that... that vibe, that kind of... that sheen of redemption. Anyway, he was lovely. He was lovely. His name... he told me his name was Sam and he bought me a beer, and he was, like, "I've always wanted to chat to you," and stuff. And we were having a yarn, but I could tell all along that he had a story he wanted to tell that he... That he wanted to testify to employ the parlance of that particular subculture. So I wasn't surprised when the story came, but I was surprised by the impact it had on me. Because he told me about his mum, right? So, Sam was an only child. Er, is an only child to a single mother. And he said his mum's, like, tough as nails, never missed a day of work in her life. Like, one of these really strong women. But, in her early 60s, she started getting quite... Quite suddenly having problems with her eyesight. So, Sam took her to the gp, and the gp took one look at... in her eyes and said, "look, Mrs. Sam, you have a degenerative eye disorder, and if you don't get surgery very soon, you are going to lose your eyesight." And Sam's mum was left reeling, you know? She hated the thought of surgery, never been to hospital, all that sort of stuff. Nevertheless, Sam booked her in to see a specialist, like, a week hence. But, meanwhile, they went to church. And Sam and his mum, he told me, are members of the dandenong pentecostal church of Jesus Christ the fishermen and table tennis champion, or, you know... You know, those... these ones. There's a lot of them in Australia. They are the big popular one... You know, they're huge modern buildings, and lots of people go there, like rock concerts, and they've always got a band. You know the ones? And every now and then, the church puts out an album. Or a prime minister. You know the ones. They love money, but they hate the gays. No, no. They love the gays, as long as they don't do any "gaying". And yet they have songs like I feel him inside me. Down on my knees for Jesus. Come on my faith. You know. You know how it is. So, anyway, they went to church that Sunday, and Sam reckons the pastor, who had known his mum for decades, got the entire congregation to pray. Sam said it was, like, three or four minutes of just absolute silence, with some 2,000 people simultaneously praying, every single one of them focusing their prayers on one thing, on the health of Sam's mum. And then, when they went to the specialist the following Wednesday, the specialist took a look in her eyes and said, "look, Mrs. Sam. Your eyes are fine. They're perfect. If anything, they look a bit youthful for your age. Your vision's 20/20. Go home." And I think the reason this story had such an impact on me is that I am an empiricist, and a proud empiricist, and the deal with being an empiricist is you must be willing and able to adjust your pre-existing hypothesis when new data comes along. And here I was, for the first time in my life, hearing a firsthand account of what can only be described as a miracle. I mean, I don't know what else it could possibly have been. If I have an apology to make n I'm afraid I've made a big mistake ii I turned my face away from you, lord n I was too blind to see the light ii I was too meek to feel your might n I closed my eyes [Couldn't see the truth, lord j'j' but then like Saul on the Damascus road n you sent a messenger to me and so j'j' now I've had the truth revealed to me j'j' please forgive me all those things isaid j'j' I'll no longer betray you, lord ii I will pray to you instead j'j' and I will say thank you n thank you j'j' thank you, god n thank you n thank you j'j' thank you, god j'j' thank you, god n thank you, god for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum Ii I had no idea but it's suddenly so clear j'j' now I feel such a cynic how could I have been so dumb? J'j' thank you for displaying how praying works ii a particular prayer in a particular church j'j' thank you, Sam for the chance n to acknowledge this omnipotent ophthalmologist n thank you, god for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum n I didn't realise that it was so simple j'j' but you've shown a great example of just how it can be done if you only need to pray in a particular spot ii to a particular version of a particular god j'j' and if you pull that off without a hitch ii he will fix one eye of one middle class white bitch J'j' [know in the past my outlook has been limited if I couldn't see examples of where life had been definitive j'j' but I can admit it when the evidence is clear j'j' as clear as Sam's mum's new cornea and that's extremely clear! N thank you, god for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum j'j' I have to admit that in the past I have been sceptical j'j' but Sam described this miracle and I am overcome j'j' how fitting that the sighting of a sight-based intervention n should open my eyes to this exciting new dimension n it's like someone put an eye chart up in front of me j'j' and the top five letters say i-c-g-o-d j'j' thank you, Sam, for showing how my point of view has been so flawed j'j' iassumed there was no god at all but now I see that's cynical ii it's simply that his interests aren't particularly broad n he's largely undiverted by the starving masses n the inequality between the various classes j'j' he gives out strictly limited passes j'j' redeemable for surgery or two-for-one glasses n I feel so shocking for historically mocking ya j'j' your interests are clearly confined to the ocular j'j' ibet given the chance you'd eschew the divine j'j' and start a little business selling contacts online n fuck me, Sam what are the odds j'j' that of history's endless parade of gods j'j' that the god you just happened to be taught to believe in n" is the actual god and he digs on healing j'j' but not the aids-ridden African nations if the victims of covid or the flood-addled asians n but healthy priva tely-ins ured Australians j'j' with common and curable lens degeneration n this story of Sam's has but a single explanation ii a surgical god who digs on magic operations n no, it couldn't be mistaken attribution of causation j'j' born of a coincidental temporal correlation j'j' exacerbated by a general lack of education n vis-a-vis physics in Sam's parish congregation n it couldn't be that all these pious people are liars n it couldn't be an artefact of confirmation bias n a product of group think a mass delusion ii an emperor's new clothes-style fear of exclusion n“ no, it's more likely to be an all-powerful magician j'j' than the misdiagnosis of the initial condition j'j' or one of many cases of spontaneous remission j'j' or a record-keeping glitch by the local physician n no, the only explanation for Sam's mum seeing j'j' they prayed to an all-knowing super-being n to the omnipresent master of the universe n and he liked the sound of their muttered verse j'j' so for a bit of a change from his usual stunt j'j' of being a sexist, racist murderous... Audience: Cunt! Ii he popped down to dandenong and just like that j'j' used his powers to heal the cataracts of j'j' Sam's mum j'j' of Sam 's j'j' mum j'j' thank you, god n for fixing the cataracts of Sam's mum ii I didn't realise that it was such a simple thing ii I feel such a ding-a-ling what ignorant scum j'j' now I understand how prayer can work ii a particular prayer in a particular church n in a particular style with a particular stuff j'j' and for particular problems that aren't particularly tough j'j' and for particular people preferably white j'j' and for particular senses preferably sight ii a particular prayer in a particular spot ii to a particular version of a particular god n and if you get that right ii he just might j'j' take a break from giving babies malaria j'j' pop down to your local area j'j' to fix the cataracts of j'j' your j'j' mum j'j' Hey, Shepherd's bush empire! Let me hear you say, "glossary"! Audience: Glossary! Of terms! Audience: Of terms! I love my job. Um... Right, I'm going to do a song that's sort of about the hedonic treadmill, broadly. But I just want to make sure everyone's up with the terminology therein. Erm, sometimes I wonder why I'm not like a proper rock star on the radio. And then I think, "yeah, I've got a glossary of terms." So, everyone know what Botox is? - Audience: Yeah! - Good. Botox, just for clarity, Botox is a portmanteau for botulinum toxin, which is a toxin you put under your skin to try and keep yourself looking young. Interestingly, it's often used by the same sort of people who'll spend a lot of time checking that their food doesn't have too many preservatives. You know, the sort of people who'll go and spend a lot of money on a detox. And then on their way out, they'll get Botox. As if the paralysis in their eyebrows diminishes their capacity for irony. You need eyebrows for irony. That's why seagulls are so literal. All right. All right. Is that your speed? It's a pity that's the only joke I've ever written. Um... Er, subway, you'll know what subway is? Their sandwiches come in foot-longs and six inches. Viagra is a drug that usually, erm, elderly gentlemen take to try and encourage their six inches to become foot longs. Um... Oh, at one point during the song, I quote the great Kurt vonnegut from his seminal text slaughterhouse-five. In that story, there's an alien race called the tralfamodorians who look like hands with eyes on their palms. And when someone in their culture dies, they say, "so it goes." And I use that quote. "So it goes," is just one of those... It's very vonnegutian. So, that's what he's known for, this sort of simple wisdom. I guess it's just an acquiescence to fate. If fate was real, which it's not. 1994 was a year. It's a year, right? In this song, I refer to it by its colloquial name, '94. It was a fucking good year. Sarah and I were in the second year at uni, and we just spent the whole year, like, bunking out of lectures and eating burger king, And fingering stuff, erm, each other. People, friends, each other mostly. Uh... It was a good year for music, too, moving right along. It was a good year for music. Er, soundgarden put out... M“ black hole sun won't you come j'j' to wash away the rain? J'j' And Pearl jam put out... N“ I can't find a better man j'j' Everyone sung like this in 1994 for some reason. Oh! Ace of base put out... J'j' I saw the sign and it opened up my j'j' it's scandi, though, so it's different. It was also... the year '94 was the year that, as part of my English course, I did a one-semester unit called English theory, which is like an introduction to post-modernism and post-modern relativism, like foucault and all those guys, the beginnings of what we now call “critical theory... And I fucking hated it! I thought, “what a load of shit." I thought, "thank god these ideas will slip away quietly." I remember thinking, "wow, imagine if, 30 years from now, we lived in a post-modern relativistic hellscape where feelings were more important than data, and, you know, interpretation was more important than intention, and the enlightenment and the scientific method were shrugged off as projects of the white patriarchy. You woke little shits! I'm sorry. No... sorry. No, no, I'm not going to go... this... I... I know I just lost a quarter of my audience. I know. I know “woke" is a dog-whistle word of the alt-right and stuff. So, don't worry, we're all still going... We still want the same things. We're on the... we're still politically aligned, broadly, I'm sure. It's just that some of us are a bit worried about the unintended consequences of... Which is to say, if you think the only sort of acceptable outcome is utopia and the only acceptable time scale is "immediately", history would suggest you're going to do more harm than good. Anyway, right! Good. Uh... So, what else? Speaking of getting into trouble... When I put this song out on my record, I got into trouble from, like, parent advocacy groups who contacted me online. They were quite cross, because, at one point, I talk about putting your kids on drugs for adhd and anxiety, and they said, "you shouldn't shame people for medicating their kids!" And I was, like, "you fuck. If you came to my house, you wouldn't think I'm ashamed of medicating kids If I can feed it to 'em like jelly babies." Ah! Do you know the best thing? Honestly, if my daughter runs out of her meds, I can literally give her some of the dog's. Same drug. Same dose. Mammals is mammals, bitches. Yeah, babe.

Human tendency... This is a short Ted talk, and then we'll get back to the show. Er, confirmation bias is a human bias towards information that confirms our pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses, right? So if there's this information out in the world, you know, a bit of data or an idea, we're much more likely to notice it in the first place, and subsequently accept it, believe it, you know, integrate it into our belief system if it confirms what we already think. In contrast, if there's a bit of information or data or an idea out there in the world that disconfirms something we think, we're incredibly good at just not noticing it. Or if someone, like, shoves it in front of our faces, we have all these neuropsychological tricks we play on ourselves to resolve the resultant cognitive dissonance. You know? We will do anything but the intellectual heavy-lifting required to change our minds. So, a working example, right? Imagine you're driving along in a car through west London, and you have a pre-existing belief that Asian women are bad drivers, right? So you're driving along, and someone pulls out in front of you and you have to slam on the brakes. You think, “oh, for fuck's sake!" And as they drive away, you notice that the driver is a female Asian person, and you go, "aha! I knew it!" And you take that data point, and you put in your pocket with the two other times that's ever happened in your whole life, meanwhile discarding the 20 or 30 times a white Van's driven out in front of you, because you think, "oh, well, they've got bad blind spots and they're always in a hurry with their deliveries or whatever." And that white Van driver might have a pre-existing belief that muslims, all muslims, are islamist terrorists, because the only time he ever really notices the word "Muslim" is when it's in 180-font, bold lettering next to the word "terrorists" in a red-top newspaper, when some dickhead Muslim does a bomb. But, meanwhile, he's disregarded the fact that the London mayor's a Muslim, or the holder of the 10,000-metre world record, or the head of the bma, or whatever. And that Muslim person might have a belief that atheists are amoral, or less altruistic, because the only time they ever think about morality or altruism is within the confines of their faith, at the mosque. And so on and so forth. And this is why, throughout history, human beings have always been terrible people. Because we are very bad at changing our minds. But then, like, 25, 30 years ago, along comes the Internet and, a little bit later, search engine algorithms. A bit after that, social media algorithms. And everything gets a lot worse. Because social media and search engines are, basically, confirmation bias robots. Like, if you set out to create an ai that did the same error that confirmation bias does, that sends you further down the path you're already down, that makes your thinking more and more binary, you could barely do better than the combination of search engines and social media. And it doesn't matter if... you don't have to start with bad intent. You know, you could just be a moderate republican sitting in Idaho or Iowa, and one day, you go to Google and say, "hello, Google, are the democrats trying to erode my second amendment rights?" And five clicks later, you're, like, "oh, so, right. Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden are lizards. The, uh..." "Lizard people down from a lizard planet, that have come to earth to start a small business, trafficking child sex slaves, out of the basement of a pizzeria." Or you could be, like, a lovely sort of hippie from the southwest of england, and you type into Google one day, um, “mindfulness yoga retreat, Devon" and five clicks later you're, like, "oh, wow, I didn't know they're using 5g towers to spread a synthesised novel coronavirus, so that Bill Gates can use fake vaccines to inject microchips into our bloodstream so he can track us wherever we go." As if all Bill Gates ever wanted was to find out where to get the best gluten-free banana bread in totnes. And all of this, all of this, both the confirmation bias and its algorithmic equivalent, it all just plays into our tribalism, right? Because we're tribal, sapiens, we love a tribe. Nationhood is a tribe, you know? “England's better than France! Fuck Europe! Yay, england!" And, you know, a city is a community, is a tribe. "Oh, London's better than Paris," or whoever. And, you know, sports teams are a tribe. "My sports team's better!" Churches are a tribe. “My church is best." Churches are just sports teams, but with mascots who can fly. The point being it's always been sociologically and evolutionarily advantageous for sapiens to retain the behaviours of their in-group, to retain the beliefs of their tribe. But ever since the Internet, since algorithmic editing, it is a fact, not just an instinct, these tribes are getting further and further apart. We're getting more and more binary, and the walls around our belief systems, around the suite of beliefs that we are required to hold, if we're to retain membership of our tribe... The walls around them are getting thicker and thicker, and harder to penetrate. And it doesn't even matter if the beliefs within your suite of beliefs are internally consistent. They never are, like... Oh, fuck. I've lived in america for four years, and if you want to be a right-wing conservative, you have to concurrently hold the following beliefs. You have to believe that Jesus is love, and lives in your heart... And that people should have unfettered access to semi-automatic weapons. If Jesus came back today, he would be fucking baffled by traffic lights... And zips... M&M's, cricket bats, women who can read and write. It would be a fucking tough time for Jesus. - But, honestly, if you want to be a conservative Christian in america, you have to believe that a first-century wandering mystic, preacher, who died 2,000 years ago, came back to life and took up residence in one of your ventricles. Presumably. I think that's the one with more headroom. And you have to believe that a person, regardless of mental health issues or background checks, should be able to walk into a supermarket and buy a gun, that is literally designed to kill as many people as possible in the shortest space of time. You have to believe that coal shouldn't be in the ground. "You get that coal out. Moses said, 'thou shalt de-sequester that carbon, put it in the sky with the angels." And you have to hate black people who kneel at football matches. “You get off your knees, boy! Your knees is for church, or... or blowjobs." And you can't... You're not allowed to lie. "I'll smash you, fascist! Fucking fascist!" And you hate... you have to hate Vaccines. "You don't take that astrazeneca! Don't take that moderna! That's big pharma. Big pharmaceutical companies trying to make money off of you." "We take ivermectin, 'cause ivermectin is made by fucking elves." And... you have to hate dick. "You're not allowed dick, if you don't... well, you can like dick if you don't got a dick. But if you got a dick, and you like a dick, that dicky on dicky make the baby Jesus feel icky." And that's your... That's your beliefs, because you're a conservative and you conserve. And then over here is us mob, the progressives, I presume we are here tonight, broadly speaking. Progressives. If you are a right-wing conservative Christian, and you stumbled in here tonight, expecting the hits of Matilda, I can only say you are welcome. This is a broad church. And I hope that at some point during the evening I manage to penetrate you. Erm, but us progressives, right? So progressives, statistically, have a higher level of education, a little bit. Now, on average, we're a bit more educated, but are we kinder? Are we? Fuck! Because modern progressives have decided that the way we're going to progress forward into a future of more empathy and understanding for more and more people is to shout, "fascist! Evil fascist!" At anyone on, like, that side of the line. And then turn to someone inside their own bubble and see if they have a belief that diverges from their own, like, one degree, and then call them out, publicly shame them on the Internet, "oh, my god, I can't believe you posted a photo of your pedicure when we're meant to be posting black squares. You're not anti-racist. That means you're racially part of the white supremacy." And this person, of course, they're now in another bubble and, human nature being human nature, they're defining themselves in opposition to those mob, and then they find someone in their bubble who has a belief that diverges from their own, one degree... "I can't believe you still follow j. K. Rowling on Twitter." "I can't believe you said, 'not all men.“' "I can't believe you used the f slur in your song." Until the whole fucking progressive movement's just bubbles, within bubbles, within bubbles, like a fucking aero bar. Like an aero bar snake eating its own fucking tail like an aero ouroboros, going... On its own tail and going, "this is disgusting!“ Because it's choc-mint, the aero, like, it's, like, "oh, yuck! Choc-mint! Who puts mint and herbs in chocolate, nestle? You fucksticks!" I got a little bit lost a little way back there, but... Oh! No, you know... I know! Oh, yeah. And don't do this. Fuck. I need a shot of Tequila, please. Erm, and, uh... If you're a progressive... I'll get it... I'll get it off you in a minute. If you're a progressive, don't do this. Don't go onto the Internet and go, "hey, fellow progressives. Like, maybe we should consider having, you know, a little... Just chill out a bit and have a bit of humility and realise that not everyone's had the opportunity to read the books we've read. And not everyone's, you know, learned the lessons that you've learned. Maybe we should apply the principle of charity and not assume that anyone who disagrees with us has nefarious intent, and try and hear the best version of their argument, not the worst. And maybe we just need to take..." "Don't you police my tone, you straight white male! - Check your privilege!" And I go, "fuck! You're absolutely right. I'm sorry. I'll check my privilege." So I go and check my privilege, which I keep in my library, on a mahogany shelf, in between my BMW keys and a large fortnum & Mason's tin of fifty dollar notes. And I come back and I say, "I checked my privilege and you're still fucking wrong, because..." - Because... Because... Because... because it cannot be, it can't. It can't. It cannot... It cannot be, can it, if the inten... If the intention of progressives, which I assume is... Is to progress forward into a future, of more empathy and understanding for more and more people, it cannot be, can it, that the primary mechanism by which we're going to make that progress, is the suppression of empathy and understanding for anyone who doesn't align with our beliefs? It cannot be that unmitigated expression of furious outrage will somehow alchemise into a future of peace and love. And, of course, there's something to be discussed about the justification of it. Of course, there's many, many reasons to be righteously furious. I'm a straight white cisgendered male, and I could be furious about 700 things before any given breakfast, but it doesn't fucking matter if it's not helping. And it's not helping that the tribes are getting further and further apart, and then... the point is, it's very hard to change people's minds. But... we got there. But it is not impossible. However, one thing is a hundred percent certain. If you told someone that they're a fascist, and publicly shame them on the Internet for what they believe, you've lost 'em. You have prioritised your need to express your outrage. And if we're honest, more often than not, signal your virtue over the possibility that you could utilise your educational privilege to reach across this algorithmic chasm. And if you're sitting there thinking, "this is a bit rich coming from you, minchin. You've literally made a living getting on stage for two hours a night and shouting whatever comes into your fat ginger head, “ I'll say to you, "that is because I am a hypocrite." And also, to be fair, I have spent... Thank you, Jimmy. I have spent many years working very hard... I'll need a broom, Jimmy. I have spent many years working very hard, and I have become adept at lazy double entendres, and fingering.

Shame! I think, um... I mean, when I do... When I sort of rant on a bit, I'm mostly lecturing myself, you know, because I'm susceptible to this shit. It's very easy when you read some opinion on the Internet that someone has that differs from your own, to assume that they are in a completely different tribe, you know, and to sort of discard them. And so, to that end, I just want to clarify. I wouldn't want to be misconstrued. Erm, I don't want anyone walking out of here thinking I actually hate aero bars a lot. I think they're... I think they're fine. I just missed the opportunity to make a joke about sweeping statements. I'm so fucking angry. I'm so furious with myself. Er, no, there's no getting... Even with the... We could pretend. Well, let's pretend. I'll do it. And you guys laugh as if you didn't know. You know, when someone on the Internet makes... oh, fuck it, it's gone. It's gone. Fuck... it's... - Oh, god! Fuck! Um... but if I'd done that, you would've thought, "oh, it was all a setup." Erm, nothing... Nothing is a fucking set up. Um... In the '903, aero bar, in Australia, had one of the best sort of straplines... One of the best slogans of any advertising I've ever seen. It was, erm, "aero bar, it's the bubbles of nothing that make it really something," which I just thought was a... Really, there's something very beautiful, rhythmic, about that, as well as conceptual. I thought about it a lot and... And it sort of dovetails into something in visual arts that I don't quite understand. You know, they talk about negative space, and the importance of negative space. You know, "the sculpture's already in the rock. The artist just needs to know which bits to remove and..." Anyway. On this pretentious line of thinking, I... I wrote a song last year called the absence of you, which kind of explores this idea... Oh, good, good, that's four... That's who bought my album. I was wondering. Um... It explores this idea that the absence of someone can sort of have more presence than the present. And, erm, I didn't think it was particularly a standout song on the album. It's a, erm... It's a silly thing. But, erm, in the last two years, or the year since the album came out, I've got more feedback about that song than any other on the record. And I think it's because, obviously, in the last couple of years, a lot of people have lost people, and those who haven't, have... Most of us have been trapped away from people we don't want to be trapped away from, erm... So, we're going to play it for you. I think what I'm saying is, er, like, the 5,000 or 10,000 extra hits on YouTube that this song got because of the pandemic, arguably make it worth it. Who knows what this new variant will add to my career. I mean... My... I don't know. Anyone got a train to catch? Here we go.

We never do this stuff, but we decided we'd fly down to Melbourne from Sydney and we just left the kids, erm, tied to the dog. And we got a hotel and we saw some friends, but mostly we just hung out. And on the Sunday morning, we just, like, slept in and then we got room service, breakfast, and we're lying on this lovely bed, and Sarah put the telly on and it was video hits, and we were lying there watching video hits. It was wicked. Uh, and then this song that had been a massive hit when we lived in la came on. It's by John Mayer, and it's called your body is a wonderland. It has a really great pop tune. It goes... N your body is a wonderland n and, I've never seen the music video, but John Mayer's, like, 6'6" and ridiculously handsome. In the music video, he's, like, in his loft apartment on his linen couch, with his chinos. And he's, like, playing his acoustic, and he's, like, N your body is a wonderland n and, the only other person in the music video is this woman, who's, obviously... who represents the object of his affections, and herjob is to wander around in, like, a business shirt, and undies, and Jeans sometimes, and just look really, really pleased that John Mayer has assessed her body to be "wonderland-ish". Anyway, all of this made me feel quite amorous, and so I turned to Sarah and I went, "that's how I feel about you, babe. I feel like your body is a wonderland." And she went... "It sounds like a theme park." And so, at that point, I just had to double down. You know, I was, like, "yeah, yeah, that's how I feel about your body. You know, I think your body is like a theme park called wonderland. Your body is like a theme park called wonderland that I first visited 27 years ago and I had the best time, and... And now I've been visiting the same theme park for the best part of 30 years and... There's never been any renovations... Or new rides put in, eventhough a couple of years ago a few kids came along and vandalised the water slide... And Sarah did not react like the girl in the music video at all! She had a very different reaction. She said, "well, Tim, your body is not like, and never has been, like a theme park. Your body is like one of those miniature ride-on, coin-operated, fibreglass, Thomas the tank engines, that you find outside ill-stop shops by motorways that you put 50p into, and get 45 seconds to a minute of repetitive jutting motions." She said, "you're just like one of those ride-on Thomas the tank engines, because half the people ever ridden on you ended up in tears." She said, "you'd be exactly like one of those ride-on Thomas the tank engines if the ride-on Thomas the tank engine was covered in little ginger hairs. One of which always gets stuck in the back of your throat, just as the thing comes mercifully to an end." I fucking hate John Mayer. Please welcome, on the saxophone, Tom Richards! On the trumpet, Rory Simmons! Yeah, right. On this slide trombone, Emma "baby" bassett! On the drums, Mr. Bradley webb! On the piano... That's my only otherjoke, that, that and the seagulls. Jak housden! On the... oh, I'm sorry, you were still moving. On the bass-a-iele is Pete clements! Beautiful. Beautiful. And on the guiro, which is a primary instrument, Sarah belkner! I'm sure you'll be pleased to know you get to go to interval after this. I promise the second act isn't quite as long. Here we go! This is a song I, erm... I wrote for Sarah. She does not like it.

I certainly appreciate, erm, putting yourself out there like that. She loves me. The holocaust! Right. Um... Smooth segue. I'm known for it. Then, I just want to tell you a true story about my, er, my wife's maternal grandmother. So, Sarah's mum's mum, er, escaped out of Nazi-threatened Poland in the spring of 1939. Right? So, about the last possible moment you could get out as the Germans and the Russians were closing in. She escaped. And when she escaped she was 19 years old, and eight months pregnant with my wife's mother, which is an extraordinary story in itself, of course. But I learned recently, and I feel foolish about this, 'cause I should have known, 'cause it's pretty simple stuff. But did you know that, erm, female mammals, like half of you mob-ish, are born with all the eggs they're ever going to have already on board. Do you know... you know this, like, obviously. So, the female mammals, all the ova they're ever going to have, are already in their ovaries, when they come out. An average is, like, 400,000 or something, which means that my wife, who's my age, escaped out of Nazi-threatened Poland... In the spring of 1939, hidden... With some 400,000 others inside the ovary of a negative one-month-old female mammal, who, in turn, was curled up tight inside the uterus, inside the distended belly, of a petite 19-year—old Polish woman. And Anne frank... Fucking Anne frank... She's all like, "oh, it's so cramped." Kids, eh? It's okay. I'm allowed to do holocaust jokes. Some of my best friends are Nazis. You can get in trouble, though, these days. I... fuck... I did a, er, like, a fundraiser for a friend in a little venue in Sydney a while back, and I did this whole joke about 9/11, and, afterwards, this woman came up to me and said, "I just need you to know that my aunt was in 9111.“ and I said to her, "I'm so sorry. I'll work her into it." None of that's true! Welcome back to the second act! Shepherd's bush empire, let me hear you say, “glossary"! Audience: Glossary! - "Of terms!" - Audience: Of terms! One, two, three, four! These er... Like, this horn section, two of them are, like, proper, high-level jazz musicians, and baby's, like, a high-level classical trombonist. And the great thing about working... And Tom, who just did... He's, like, literally, he's a professor at Oxford. And the great thing about working with such incredible jazz musicians is that, honestly, you pay the minimum wage and they'll do any... they'll just do anything. - -Do whatever you... - Do whatever you want them to. Right. So this song is about, erm, Los Angeles. So, in Los Angeles, when we lived in Los Angeles, we lived near a place called Griffith park, and it's famous for a few reasons. One... On the far West Side of Griffith park is the Hollywood sign. Obviously, which is quite famous. Erm, near where we lived is also the Griffith observatory, which is this beautiful art deco astronomical observatory, and right near our house is another place in Griffith park called Bronson caves, which is just an old quarry, but some of the quarry activities left these caves, and one of them's quite well known in Hollywood for being the exterior of the "batcave", in the 1966 original TV show with Adam west. Does anyone remember that? You know, the really... the super-camp one with all the innuendos? Like, all the kind of cheeky, sexy jokes... with a... It strikes me that it's possible that there weren't any sexy jokes, but I just thought there were. But that's okay, because I have a deep-held philosophical belief that I would rather die having seen filth where it wasn't intended... Than die having missed a single double entendre that was. It's just I feel strongly about that. Erm... yeah. Febreze? We have febreze in the UK, right? Yeah, it's an air freshener that's popular in america. Ucb is upright citizens brigade. Erm, upright citizens brigade are a famous improv troupe in Chicago and New York and Los Angeles. Erm, you kids know the word "ennui"? Ennui is a French word. It means boredom, but in English it tends to be used, like, by wankers, for, like, a sense of depression that you get from stasis, basically. If you're a proper wanker, you might try and put it in a song. Erm... Hollywood and vine is an intersection. Vine street and Hollywood boulevard. And on that corner is where all the tourists hang out and you'll often find a dude, like, dressed as elmo, who will charge you 15 bucks for a photo, so that he can afford to buy the meth that he has to buy to make himself feel better, for the fact that he dresses as elmo. It's a vicious sesame street spiral. Lax is their airport. You know that, yeah. There's a vegan restaurant in Hollywood called gratitude. It's really good food. I... I'm not a vegan myself, but I like going to vegan restaurants, the food can be really, really great, but they manage always to be incredibly annoying in other ways. Like, there's a vegan restaurant near where I grew up in cottesloe in west Australia, and the food's fantastic, but they've always got incense burning, and there's, like, dream catchers, and, like, four nights a week, they have a sitar player. You're just, like, "for fuck's sake. I just wanted, for one night, to eat a meal without harming a sentient being. And I'm having to resist the urge to tear the spleen out of that white, dreadlocked motherfucker." Anyway, that's nothing compared to gratitude in Hollywood. You're going to fucking die. At gratitude in Hollywood, all the menu items, all the meals, are adjectives. Fuck! I... Honestly, like, the meals are called things like "adoring" and "thriving" and "gracious". And, no, no, no, fuck, I mean, I know it's appalling, but that's only half of it. This is where it gets really fucked up. At the... At the top of the menu, it says, "when your waitperson comes to your table, please order by saying, 'i am dot, dot, dot," followed by your dish of choice. Cunts. That is not fucking okay. And then some anaemic waiter will drag himself to the kitchen and go, “he's thriving," and he'll come back with some fucking bean curd. I hate them. I know. I understand that, very soon, it's going to just simply... Like, laughing at vegans, it's just not going to be, like, funny any more. It's just not quite yet. Fucking vegans. Making a personal sacrifice for the sake of the planet. Who do they think they are? Arseholes. For clarity, subtextually, it's myself I hate. Right, okay. Erm... What else do you need to know? 101 is a freeway. Er, Tesla is a steam-powered car. Well, unless you plug it into a grid that has solar, and stuff, and basically, er... it's steam powered. Coal... burn the coal, boil the water, steam drives the turbines. Plug it into your steam-powered car, man. It's not fucking stephenson's rocket. Zero emissions, my arse! I love Tesla. I'm just being annoying. Er, what else? Just play the song. Just play the song. Okay. This is a song that I wrote about the experience of leaving la. And, because I'm brilliant, I, er... I entitled this song, "leaving la ". J'j' check the locks and leave the keys j'j' mouldy bath masked with febreze j'j' something's dead behind the refrigerator j'j' some poor fuck will deal with it later n“ I've spent the last ten weeks n squeezing out the sponge of friendships plugging leaks n I've talked until there's no more to say j'j' I'm going away ii I'm leaving la ii I'm leaving la j'j' and the tourists say j'j' please give me the directions to the Hollywood sign j'j' I've always dreamt of coming here to see the Hollywood sign j'j' but on their way back down we 'ii ask, "did you have a good time?" J'j' they'll say it's just some fucking letters on a hill n I wander through the Bronson caves j'j' one more ok coffee at the oaks gourmet n“ I 'ii watch the players at the ucb j'j' trying to improvise their way out of ennui n walking trails in the creeping dark j'j' up to the observatory in Griffith park n there's too much light for stars anyway if I'm getting out of this place ii I'm leaving la ii I'm leaving la j'j' hey and the studio executives who never made a thing n blaming others for their failures j'j' taking credit for their wins n wiping the blood of dumb artists from their chins singing j'j' kid, you oughtn't take it personally j'j' on Hollywood and vine n a dime-store spiderman j'j' shouting at a stoned Emma stone n dressed a la "la la land" n in the distance in both its glorious dimensions n the sign projects its shadow on the hill J'j' rushing by machine-gunned cops at lax j'j' malfunctioning departure board says we 're boarding next j'j' belt off, shoes off jacket off, hat j'j' don't need that attitude j'j' but I quite enjoy the subsequent pat down n and I'm sat down as the a380 engine roars j'j' pushed backwards as this tube of monkeys rumbles forwards j'j' looking forward ii to another 20 hours on a plane n nothing but shit films and my brain n I've been going slowly insane if I've seen your sport and I don't wanna play n I'm getting out of this place n I'm getting out of this place ii I'm leaving la j'j' hey and the actors at gratitude drinking undrinkable juice j'j' and the agents taking 10% in their sneakers and suits j'j' and the writers in their teslas trying to punch up act one j'j' driving home on the 101 in the relentless fucking sun j'j' and the needy and the greedy j'j' and the homeless and horny j'j' and the deals done on treadmills at ten to six in the morning j'j' and the captain's on the pa saying, "look for the sign!" J'j' but I find it's just some fucking letters on a hill n it's just some really ugly letters ii on a pretty ugly hill Ii I'm leaving la J'j' I'm leaving I... n - So I've got... - I have this... I sometimes have this urge to rectify... You know, like, I use my family forjokes. Like, I just I need to clarify that I love my... I do love my family. I love my Sarah, I love Violet, and I love... The boy, the... Caspar! I love them. But... There is a love, in my life, that, erm, in many ways is more profound than even my love for my own children. It's certainly more complex. Erm... And the only way I can really speak to this love is through the medium of a short ten-minute long rock opera - that I'd like to perform for you now. Er... - If you'll... if that's okay. Obviously, erm, you know this, erm... Having to be very vulnerable in front of you, but, erm... er... I think you'll understand. So, erm... See you at the other end. One, two, three, four! Cheese. Cheese. - Audience: Cheese. - Cheese. Shepherd's bush, let me hear you spell! C! What? I can't hear you! H! Huh? What? Fuckin'... fuckin'... fuckin'... What is it? Cheese! J'j' I love cheese but it's plain to see j'j' that cheese n cheese -j'j' doesn't love me -j“j' doesn't love him -j'j' I am such a fool in love -j'j' fool in love -j'j' I just cannot get enough -j'j' can't get enough -j'j' but it's an unrequited love -j'j' unrequited love ii I can feel it in my guts n" I spend my nights j'j' tossing and turning my stomach is churning ii my heart is a-burning n my nightmares are turning to haunt me and shame me ii to drive me insane oh, the pain of blue vein on my brain j'j' and I wake up with sweat on my brow if you know I gotta give it up and I must do it now j'j' but instead in the morning when my wife is gone ii I find myself back on n cheeseworld. Com ii and I know that it's wrong but I'm soon navigating ii to the real mature stuff the funky old ladies n feeding my fetish for fettered old feta j'j' photos of friesian on beds of bruschetta n and the worse they smell the more they sweat n the faster the speed my lips gets wet n oh, god! Woman: Whoo! J'adore ie fromage. Mais ie fromage n'adore pas Me. Rien, je ne regrette rien! Mais... J'j' perhaps last night's half-wheel of double-cream brie j'j' trying to replace my fondues with fon-don'ts j'j' trying to develop strength of will j'j' but I know that I won't if I have found love is never fair h we should be such a marvellous pair j'j' but each time I bring her home, she goes and renders me comatose j'j' and leaves me self-loathing j'j' slumped on my chair Ii I cannot J'j' camem Don't fucking ruin this. Ni Ii I cannot j'j' camem - audience: Bert... - Shut up! Okay, tens... I'm creating, I'm creating tension. I'm creating tension. Ii I cannot so fucking good, this bit. It's so good. I mean, there's a lot of baffled faces down in the front. But they just... what they're gonna... Oh, my god, it's gonna change your fucking life. It's really... I mean, to the extent that you can be objective about any art. This next bit is... It's a very strong word. It's probably... I think this is the best song I've ever written. It might be one of the best songs ever written. Especially this next bit, it's fucking... Has anyone not heard this song? Who hasn't heard this song? Oh, okay. Fucking hell, man, you guys are... you... You must be shitting yourselves with excitement. Imagine having... imagine if this is the first time you heard it. Imagine how good... Don't you feel good for them? What... 'Cause you remember when you first... Of course you remember where you... I mean, no-one ever forgets when they first heard this bit of this song. It's amazing. It's just... it's like you remember where you first heard... Never mind. You know, that's really... Ii I can... Oh, fuck it. What's... N“ I can, I...

This is a song about trying not to have sex with other people. J'j' I'll take lonely tonight j'j' your offer is kind j'j' and I must confess I!" that I find your casual caresses j'j' and that pretty dress I!“ pretty hard to resist j'j' and, Christ, what a night I!“ I think you're pretty high I!“ I know I'm pretty pissed I!“ but I'll take lonely tonight j'j' though I'm not denying I!"

J'j' I'll take lonely tonight ii in my 3.5 star n boutique hotel n where I will spend 25 bucks on minibar snacks n and pass out on my phone n and wake in four hours or so soaked in relief j'j' to find I am alone j'j' with only the wrappers of pringles and snickers m for which to atone j'j' blissfully lonely j'j' I!" ch, ooh n ooh I!" ch, ooh I!" ch, ooh n ooh I!" ch, ooh I!" ch, ooh n ooh h And so we come to the end of this show and this tour... The world as we know... Erm... I, er... I've actually, speaking of endings, I've, erm... I've planned my dying words. I think you should plan your dying words 'cause you want to go out on something good, right? And, in my experience, dying people are all over the place. They're... they're not thinking straight at all. So I think it's worth Locking it in early. Anyway, my dying words... I think you'll approve. My dying words are going to be, erm... Who's the world gonna revolve around now? I think that's quite strong. Anyway, I was thinking upon... Having locked them, and I was thinking about my epitaph because it's good to go out on a good line, obviously, but it's also good to leave a good line behind, so you'll want something on your tombstone that's gonna work. And I know, you guys, this will probably come as a shock to you, but I have to admit sometimes, especially when I have a few drinks, erm, I can have a tendency to go on a bit. And the other morning, we woke up, Sarah and I, having been to a dinner party at a friend's house the night before, and I rolled over and I said to Sarah, for what feels like the 100th time, "oh no, I think I talked too much.“ And I think we stayed too long." And I thought, "that's my fucking epitaph. That's what I'm gonna have on my tombstone, 'talked too much, stayed too long'." And then if I get really old it will be apt. And if I die young, it will be ironic. And then I thought, "I should write a song about it," and so, I'm going to finish this show, given that I did open the show on a self-indulgent, self-eulogising contemplation of possibility of my own demise in an aircraft accident, which you missed. Erm... It was always coming back. Er, anyway, this is, like, a potted autobiography of my life, in a sort of12-bar blues sort of format. It's basically my ballad of John and yoko. But I am neither John nor yoko. Anyway, it starts back in Perth, about the time I wrote mitsubishi Colt, and it travels a journey that you've heard a bit about tonight. Sarah and my weird last 15 years, and then it projects forward into a hopeful future, where I get so old that I need someone else to wash my scrotum. - Thank you so much for coming tonight and being part of, er, our last night. - Please thank, one more time, yourselves! And Brad webb! And Pedro, Pete clements. And Tom Richards! And Rory Simmons! And baby bassett! And Sarah belkner! And jak... jak housden. Thank you very much! One! Two! Three! Four!

For the record, I'd probably do Desmond tutu now. Just because, erm... I've met Richard and he's fantastic, and I'd like to meet Desmond. Should we do, erm, just the carry you stage?
