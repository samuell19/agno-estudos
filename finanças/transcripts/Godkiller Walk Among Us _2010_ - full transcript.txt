It began with two words. Non serviam. I will not serve. And then silence. For there were none left alive to hear the reply. In a hail of concrete dust, uranium, and pulverized steel, the answer to a question, how do you kill a god? Better question: How do you kill an old man that has outlived his era? A man haunted by the memory of a million souls extinguished in a moment. A moment this next generation doesn't even know occurred. I am not a proud man. My gifts are earned at a shameful price. A brothel. I am entering a brothel for maybe the hundredth time. I, Mulciber, who spat in the face of gods. I spit upon my own frail bones. Those familiar smells. Desperation. Compromise. Veterans of holy wars never die. We simply forget why we lived. Check all the Weapons. I have none Extend your right hand. I do not have cybernetics. It's policy. The inhibitor ring is a humiliation to one such as myself. Were I still young, I would cut this cretin. But I am not young. And humiliation assumes there is a soul alive who cares that you exist. Strange. My stomach turns at his touch. This man will be dead shortly. Must get to the sweetling and make sure she is safe. At least he didn't cut your face. You'd be demoted to janitor. Is that a demotion? Sucking' dicks beats cleaning' toilets. Oh, maybe I could be a specialist. A concept whore. Get sucked off by Stitchface for just a few credits more. Don't give Beezal any ideas. We'll all wake up without our faces tomorrow. The Leatherface Girls. I'm not kidding, Halfpipe. You keep that shit to yourself. I don't wanna get slashed up for a marketing stunt. No, not for a marketing stunt. What's a body worth these days after all? Well, hello there, Dr. Mulciber. To what evil do we owe thanks for your visit? A kidnapping in the Republic? A nuke chip gone rogue in Silver City? Oh no, nothing quite so noble this time, my dear. Just another corporate espionage investigation. Well, I'm glad we can be of service. I see you've requested Halfpipe again. That will be 50,000 units. Thank you for your business. Your oral hygiene never ceases to amaze. Keeping the toilet clean. Come in. Hi, Dr. Mulciber! Hello, sweetling. What's the crime this time, old man? Missing merchandise, stolen from an aristocrat who likely stole it in the first place. Whoring your gifts to the powers that be? These are the times that we live in. Well, let's solve the crime! Before I forget, I know the two of you have been building up a collection. Wow! You shouldn't have! Outer City has two natural resources: flesh and blood. The flesh of young sweetlings is sold in the brothels, but the rusted sky and sickened waters create a demand for clean blood and fresh organs. Only one who has not lived in servitude could judge them for seeking to buy back their flesh with the blood of others. It's not too much, but I hope it will help. It will definitely help. You're a good man, Dr. Mulciber. Within The Ether is an ocean. Unlike our oceans, which are comprised of hydrogen and oxygen, this ocean is comprised of our thoughts. For thoughts are as real as atoms. If there is knowledge you seek, it is known by someone, somewhere, sometime. And so it can be found. Many can enter this ocean, few can navigate it. Once, I was celebrated for my skill, respected by great men. I knew, however, they would never understand my methods. The men of my order are chaste and sex magic is held in contempt. Of course, I was found out. My gifts ridiculed. My service despised. - [Guard] Check all weapons. Extend your right hand. The Ether is fierce, screaming danger, answering questions I did not ask. I am no longer navigating this ocean. I am deep in the undertow! Drowning in visions. Fire is at the door. Pestilence, fear! Dragos! Don't let her kill the boy. What? What do you want? Bring me to the pimp called Beezal. What the fuck? The air shaft, go! Don't gotta tell me twice. Are, are you... They're at the door, go! You there, don't move. I am an old man, feeble. It's been a lifetime since I've stood between death and a lady. It's been too long. To defend is human. To kill, divine. Run for the hills, sweetling. The dogs of war are loosed and you'll never know peace again. Heh. I'd forgotten the sensation of turning invisible while being watched. Am I enjoying this too much? Walking unseen amongst the dead can be unsettling. The living are oblivious, but the gaze of the dead is constant and fixed, filling The Ether with judgment: raw and unbiased by emotion or intellect. Have you gone mad, Dragos? Dragos, son of Bafomet, heir to the throne of the last earthbound reptilians. When his mother died, the sky rained blood for a thousand days. Where is it? What? Beezal, pimp, trafficker of stolen body parts. Appears to have gotten into some trouble. Where is it? Find it. Come on, we gotta get the fuck outta here. This is so fucked up. It hurts me to do this to you. Master, I found it. Excellent. Thank you for your service. Return to your Gaia, my son, and be free. This all could have been so much simpler. Your silence is a betrayal that cannot go unanswered. And so, I pity you. Such immortal sadness. Such atrophy of soul. Thou shalt never betray me again. In the name of Copper, Queen of The Burnt. I accept this oath of holy service. Love is the law. Love under will. Non serviam. Ugh! Scopes! I'm such a pussy. Oh no. Fucking smoke alarm! Non serviam. What does that mean? It means I will not serve. I understand the translation, Tommy. But what does it mean to you? Whom do you refuse to serve? The Republic? Yes, you should be careful what you say. You should also be careful what you read. This mythology you're reading might seem noble to you right now. It's not mythology- - Tommy, these are exciting stories but you must understand. Here in the Republic, in civilization, this is where morality and principles and truth and justice exist. Outer City is a wasteland. Full of criminals and murderers who kill you and gut you and sell your organs without a second thought. For your file, tell me, who is it that you refuse to serve? What shall I write here? The Republic? Please, no. I know you've been having a hard time. I know how hard it must be to watch your sister sink deeper into her vegetative state. Deeper? I've been updating her file. I'm doing everything I can to get her the very best medical attention possible. But if you keep behaving so erratically, it could jeopardize my ability to get her medicine. Tommy, do you remember what you told me at our very first meeting? When you first came here to the orphanage? You asked me, why did God take your mother but not you? Well? Have you come to any conclusions? I haven't earned his love. That's right, Tommy. Good. Come back tomorrow, same time. We'll discuss how you can earn God's love. Dismissed. Stupid Dr. West. Stupid orphanage with junky old machines from a hundred years ago. Stupid. Please wake up. Can't they even buy you a decent bed that doesn't fucking break every time I lean on it? Assholes. I'm gonna get us out of here, Lucy. I'm sorry you got sick. I'll figure something out. I promise. What should I write in your file? What should I write in your file? Write this in your file, asshole. Where do you go home at night? Do you have a family? Are any of them sick? Put on your gas mask, Dr. West. Mustn't take any chances. I'll breathe it. I'll suck in the soot and spit tar in your face. I'll breathe fire. Behold, the eye of God. Easy. Easy. Easy. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. I'm an idiot. Ah well, fuck it. Locked, of course. What are you looking at, asshole? Crowbar, meet file cabinet. Persecution complex? What a dick! You better not say shit like that about my sister. It is her heart. No. You fucking bastard! Doing everything you can for her? No. No! Wait right here a moment. - Dr. West, oh, fuck. He's got more guys waiting outside. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay, come in. What's your name? Or should I just call you whore? - She's Halfpipe, my name's Angelfuck. You can call me whore if your credit's good. And which star system did my angel fall from? You'll have to taste me to find out. This could go so terribly wrong in so many different ways that I can't really figure out which would be the worst. But if he fucks her on this desk, I'm seriously gonna puke and totally blow my cover. - Oh god, I've always found the filth of Outer City to be so passionate. Most of my recent partners have been catatonic. - Don't leave me out of the party! You look so young and innocent. Are you young and innocent? Oh yes. Pure angel flesh. And we can be corrupted with a kiss. Yeah. Come on, Halfpipe. Delicious. Let's show him how we do it in Outer City. Oh yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes. Holy shit, you've gotten good at that. Now, you. Come closer. - I could devour you both my filthy broken angels. Come. Come to me. Come closer. Watch me. What the fuck?! Call me whore now, asshole. We need to figure out a more efficient way of doing this. Murder shouldn't be efficient. It should be messy. Now grab me that crowbar, would ya? You just like this system 'cause you're the one who gets laid every time we have to kill someone. When you learn to weaponize your orgasms then you can be the one who gets laid. Oh, one of these days, I'm going to figure out that you don't need to cum to do that. That'll be a sad day. Hey, hey! Careful with the merchandise. Yeah, yeah. I can't believe this is happening. I can't believe how awful it smells. Damn it. This guy didn't take very good care of himself. Ugh, there's a lot of foul shit in here. We have to start finding a higher class of John. Don't blame me. I'm the A-lister on this team. Maybe you oughta start plucking your boob fur instead of shaving it. Ugh, this guy's blood is fucking horrible. We'll have to sell him for scrap. Sucks. This'll barely buy us back into Beezal's good graces. What a fucking waste. We'll figure something out. Let's get out of here. Close call. They're organ thieves. This is so fucked up. Stupid Dr. West, bringing hookers back from Outer City. Organ thieves. Organ thieves. Wait! What the fuck? Bad idea, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die, oh fuck. They're gonna gut me, just like Dr. West. Just like Dr. West- - Let me guess, you want an autograph? Uh. Republic guards that way, you'll get fragged for sure! It seems we have a guardian angel here. Shall I clip his wings? I'll make you a deal. You've got plenty of leverage, sweetmeat. I'll show you the safest way out. We'll drain you dry, but slowly. Listen, I need a heart that'll be compatible for a 14-year-old girl. - Deal. - What? But how do we know you won't turn us in? For offing Dr. West? Fuck that guy! You're the only witness. Yeah, because I was hiding here to do it myself! Bullshit. It's true. He was going to pull the plug on my sister. What's the way out? Just go 10 feet along the ledge and you'll find hand and footholds. You can get on the roof that way, double back and jump down to the top of the old shipping house. We scorched the lenses off all the cams. They're totally clear. We play skeets there all the time. Oh, that's fascinating. She's gonna hit me again. I can't move. I hate you Dr. West. I'm sorry, Lucy. All right, all right, all right. What? He's dead. Come on, let's go. Fuck that, this kid is lunch. We only have one cryo-case. So what, we'll dump the duck shit. Kids kind of be fresher. Let me at least taste him first to be sure. This guy's blood's filthy. Really? I thought he'd be clean as fuck. Ah, that's why. What? The cut on his thumb. What about it? Nanodust. That's how the kids are doing it these days. Really? It's really weird. Are you sure? I'm sure. Come on, let's get out of here. Nano dust, huh, stupid kids. Hey, wait up, I'm coming. Either the dead can dream or I'm alive. I'm alive. Although my guts are hanging out on my belly. At least I still have my guts Gross. Okay, status report. Dr. West is very dead. He turned off the camera when he came in and the last thing it recorded before that was me hiding under the desk. Suspicious much? The lady seemed to have generously left me a breadcrumb trail. I am an idiot. Yes, I'm actually following a trail of my own blood. It's not a good day when not seems like the best available option They didn't see me. And they were leaving and I stopped them. That was a bad idea. The fuck was I thinking? Crossing this bridge would be a much worse idea. There's no way I'm following them across this bridge. No way. This is a terrible idea. Status report, I crossed the bridge. I don't know where I'm going. I've been draining blood for an hour. I will pass out shortly. All bad things. Flying too close to the sun, kiddo. Oh, shit. You need a friend. That wasn't friendly. People are really fucking mean. Clean as a fetus. Thanks, kid. I've been waiting forever to win the lottery. Okay, I'm gonna get hit again. This time with nails. Good night. Rose, it's Rabbit. Get out of here. Come on, I got good stuff. Yeah, right. If that meat pies contagious I'll gut you for parts, maggot That is a foul smelling bag of shit. Even for you. Is he dead? Unconscious. Smells dead. He's unconscious. He's scrap. I'll give you 50 credits and that's kind. Taste him. New things, Rose. If I taste him, will you leave? Certainly, and richer than I came. Where did you find him? How much? Please send Dr.Vorken. He's a mess. You should've been more careful. I didn't do it. How much? Hold on. Dr.Vorken, please give me an estimate on stitching him up so I can deduct it from rabbits fee. I don't know how you sleep at night, Rose. Sleep, Rabbit? I haven't slept in 20 years. What is fresh? What is fresh? Goddammit Beezal, I'm trying to run your business here. I can't do it if you keep getting high on our supply. What is fresh? Whatever you want boss. Row 257. It's a freshest trade we've had in years. I smell it, fresh. So fresh. I'm in hell. Just like Dr. West said, God hates me. Don't talk. You'll forgive me if I don't give a shit what you think or say or beg. And I prefer you not to look at me. Just how much do you know of pain, bloodling? Send in the borderly. This is gonna get messy. You're kind of young, ain't ya? Close your eyes, kiddo. Oh that miserable ass, Halfpipe. This kid's got enough problems without you making this take any longer than it's got too. God, Halfpipe? I followed her into living. She sees me. Recognizes me? I don't know. Empty amount, Halfpipe. I don't him cumming all over me while I'm working. Oh, that's some gash you've got there. That's too sloppy to be a knife wound. What the butcher use, a shovel? I like the way you shudder when I stroke your gash. Is he done? Yes, sir. Good, wipe him down. Rose wasn't kidding about that blood, ah, fresh. I haven't tasted a virgin in years. Will that be all, sir? - [Beezal Yes, move Us. You've got some good blood, kid. It's fucking with my head. No clue what I'm talking about, huh? Now you do, bastard. Folks in the outer city have a sophisticated palette for the energy and blood, yours is so fresh. It makes me feel like my soul is cumming. Let's get a look at what kind of damage Rabbit did to your pretty face. Oh, wow, kid. Did you do that to yourself? You've got balls, I'll give you that. It's cute you wanna to be member of The Burnt and I'm sure you're pretty upset right now being that there are chased order of holy monks and all but between you and me, I know a couple of those guys and they might not be as opposed to them this situation, as you probably assume. And if you ever do wind up in arms reach of one of those dirty old mystics, I highly suggest you teach your heart to stop pumping blood. Once they get a whiff of your milk, they won't stop sucking your tits until they reach Nirvana. And your leather skin sack blows away with the wind. Don't think I haven't noticed your hand there, kiddo. I'm not all bad. Come on, come close. I'll give you a minute before I bite. I'm gonna hurt you, kid. I'm gonna hurt your real bad. It's not personal and it ain't sexual. I just got this problem is all. And I'm going to take it out on you and I'm not gonna lie. It'll help you quit. And it won't sting, but you'll survive. You'll still be clean afterwards. Feel that battle scar&gt; See, we match. We're both torn up and stitched together. We've both been ripped open, penetrated, cast aside and hold ourselves up and spat out a mouth full of blood and got on with it. I was young once too. No one starts out torn to pieces. We all have to earn our scars. Our scars are maps. Go ahead. Slide into it. That feels like a beating, don't it? Dragos gave me that gash. Motherfucker fell out of the sky with a tentacle between his legs, the size of a T-Rex and just as hungry. Cut me in pieces, clawing through my skin and coiled around my insides. I never felt nothing like that before. What is that? Dragos left that in me, fucking Dragos. Sorry kid, this his goes much worse when I'm angry. This hunger is a force of nature. Everything must be struck down, broken, smashed by the hammer of the gods. Whatever rises again is good. Whatever stays down should never have existed. You're a good sport kid. Don't take it personal. Not everyone's first time is rose pedals in milk. And open air shaft. If I'm lucky, maybe it'll lead me into an incinerator. You were right. She was gonna kill him. He followed me. I left him a path because we got him but I managed to leave an air shaft open for him to sneak out. You did well. What is it that's cast you into this intrigue? Tommy, I will not hurt you. I only wish to help you along this path you're on. Love is the law. Love under will? Good. It's true. Behold, Tommy, more than just your nightmares have come true. I'm surprised tails of The Burnt still make it into Silver City. Only in comic books. People say they're just myths. All myths are truths. Lurking in shadow, waiting to be discovered. Tommy, I don't know what the fates have in mind for you but they've led you to these borderlands for a reason. You're bound to discover that many legends you've fantasized about are very much true. And many historical facts you've been indoctrinated with are quite contrived. The education you received in the Silver City, your teachers weren't equipping you for wisdom. They equipped you for servitude. Non-serviant Excellent, excellent. Sweetling, would you assist me? Of course. You were brought to my attention, Tommy, during a recent remote viewing session. I was hired to discover the whereabouts of a stolen item called in the Niburu Box. Are you familiar with it? No, what is it? It's sort of a radio transmitter and you're gonna lead me to it. How? I don't know yet. We'll peer into the abyss for insight. What are you doing? Just a moment. What are you doing? Tommy, what the hell? I'm sorry, Tommy. I misjudged your understanding. What? It's unfortunate my abilities are reliant on these methods. Don't you justify anything. Your gifts are not unfortunate. Tommy, stop being such an asshole. Fucking relax. A child's heart. You're on a quest for compatible heart. Yes. Your sister. The 14 year old girl. There is one such heart that belongs to the son of Starkiller. Star killer is real? Oh yes. And Princess Copper? You've learned much from your comic books, Tommy. How is his quest for a heart going to find you the Nibiru Box. I don't know. Let's have a taste of you, shall we? No! I'm not gonna hurt you. Relax. Why is everyone constantly trying to drink my goddamn blood out here? I'm sorry. I keep forgetting how little they teach you in the Silver City. When Beezal bought you she probably wanted to know how clean your blood is but I simply want to check your dragon lines. My what? The blood lines you've descended from. You mean my parents? It goes back further than that. But yes, may I? Oh, my. What? I've never tasted anything quite like this. Constellations and quantum mechanics. Strength, yes, strength. Strength of anger and lust. Oh, how it pounds through my chest like I'm 18 again. Sword raised in the black rain, shouting from Buffalo to you. Watching the ride and fire. Wanting this, I wanna bleed him dry and bask in this. His just a boy. I could remain in this moment forever. Are you okay? - We have to get out of here now. Your ring, it's glowing. She found us, how could I be so stupid? Ah, Mulciber, say it isn't so. It's not. I was joking. When they told me the tracks were here, I didn't wanna believe them. And you, treasonous bitch. I'll use your ovaries as a piggy bank. No! You got a crush on this worm boy? She doesn't have a big enough dick for you. The Nibiru Box. What? I can get it for you. Don't do me no favors kid. Explain this to me old man. Exactly, how did you wind up in possession of my property? And who will suck your decrepit old cock after I tear this horse throat out? And finally, why does my pin cushion of a boy joy know about the Nibiru Box? You've tasted him, haven't you? I have too. Of course you've tasted him, you fiend. You'd be half dead right now if you didn't lick his pure angelic juice off the floor. This is destiny. Don't be so dramatic, geyser. Let her go. All right boy, earn your scars. What is that? Metarachnoid lava. How long before they hatch? One week. Let her go. Whatever you say, boy. Now step away from the traitor. I'll let you live Halfpipe, but you're fired. Here's a tip, Dragos has it. I know. One week. Where am I? Relax. No, get that needle away from me. You need the painkillers. I don't want it. I don't believe it. Let him feel it. That's insane. It's his choice. Fine, I can take it. You're all crazy. What is this made of? Very strong. You must have a replaced once a year, otherwise it will break down. And infect your bloodstream I thought The Burnt don't accept cybernetic enhancements. By cybernetics we mean military or cosmetic enhancements. Stitching up battle wounds is another issue entirely. And those trotium splints in your hand will be removed when your bones heal. Shall I remove the inhibitor ring? What is this thing? Well to begin with, it's how Beezal tracked you to my room. Well, get it off then. Not so fast, Tommy. Beezal already knows where you are. We work for her now. If we get this thing off me, then we don't have to. Unfortunately, Beezal is quite a bit smarter than that. Before releasing us, she shot you with metaachnoid larva. What's that? It's exactly what it sounds like. Mutated spider eggs. By now it's spread throughout your bloodstream. If left untreated for one week, those spider eggs will hatch in every vein, artery and capillary. They will slowly eat you alive from the inside out. You can't make a cure? - Nope. Why not? Is mutated larva. We would have to know exactly what form of mutation Beezal used. There's only one pesticide and it belongs to Beezal. Now back to the matter of the inhibitor ring, Beezal uses the inhibitor ring on her slaves for three reasons. It deactivates cybernetics. It serves as a tracking device and it disables ID nanochips which flow throughout your bloodstream alongside all of those spider eggs. What? The Republican plants all its children with ID nanochips Which can monitored through the right retina. I know that from the Birth comics. Yes, but people's locations can also be tracked by the Republic via ID nanochips. Since these are often by slaves abducted from the Republic... The inhibitor ring blocks the Republic's ability to track them. I get it, I get it. Excellent. So, I guess what you're saying is I should leave it on. Why didn't you just say so? You must make your own decisions Whatever. I'm giving you information so that you can exercise free will in the Republic. They censor and distort information and by doing so they restrict freewill, outlaw it. When freewill is outlawed, Tommy, only outlaws will have freewill. Can you make a cybernetic heart? Certainly heart, lung, kidney. A heart, can you make one for a teenage girl? Of course, bring her in. You need her here? Oh definitely. All cybernetics are very uniquely constructed for recipient is specially high. Interesting. Where's Halfpipe? She went to a tattoo parlor. What? She wasn't pleased with my work. Come on now, your work was fine but the poor girl doesn't want to have a face full of scars for the rest of her life. Is he coming back? She'll be meeting us at the bar. What bar? We'll need help. If we're gonna find trackers. I want you to prepare yourself, Tommy. There are many things in this world which your education has not prepared you for. I've noticed. While you're in there do not interact with anyone unless you absolutely must. And especially no eye contact. Okay. Good, Tommy good. You're an excellent student, my boy. If you wish to survive in outer city you must learn to adapt. Your people survived as long as they did by forcing their world to adapt to their needs. But the world laughs last Tommy, do you understand? No Of course not, I'm not making any sense, am I? You must adapt yourself to survive in this world. And adaptation is not what your people are known for. And listen hard and try to understand, human beings are hypnotized by light. They believe light is reality. Human reality is based on how human brains interpret light reflecting off objects. Do not believe what you see. An example then, matter is not solid. Huh? These objects you see around you, They're physical things. They are not solid. They are comprised of atoms. Well, atoms are mostly hollow. If an atom with the size of this building here, the actual hard matter inside would be smaller than your thumb. Really? Packed together are like sand on the beach. The sand is solid enough for you to stand on but the sand will allow you to pass. If you exert, you will and borough your hand through it. You perceive objects when they reflect light The learnered can control their atoms and allow the light to pass through. Instead of reflecting, see. Scopes! You can't see me. The light is not reflecting. It is passing through my atoms. How can you do that? Well, you shall learn, but for now, do not trust your eyes. - I'll get a referral, wait for me. Hey kid, could you throw me that amp? Sure. I told you not to interact with anyone. I was just moving an amp. Come on. Thanks. Excuse me. Excuse me. We're seeking a bounty hunter, you come highly recommended. I'm sorry, we're looking for Soledad. Yeah, whatever you want old man. I take 80% of the loot and 100% of the bounties. Excuse me? And my fee is collateralized against both your bodies and all your possessions. - I'm sorry, I think you misunderstood my question. Then maybe you'll understand my answer. Fuck off. Nice bounty hunter, doc You there, don't move. Look, Republic guards, they're arresting her. Step away, maximum security prisoner. What are the charges? 17 counts of political assassination. Now step aside. Oh, she really is a bounty hunter. Where are you taking her? Step aside old man or you'll be joining her. Political assassination? That's punishable by death. It could be worse. What are you looking for anyway? I don't know. There's this guy who has this box we have to get. Some crime boss or something, but really I have to find a heart of this other guy, I guess he's the son of Starkiller but... I gotta get this box for this crazy pimp or I'll else these spiders... Frag these clowns and I'll drop my few to 75. What? Frag them? Too slow, choker. Soldier down, soldier down. All right, 85%, it is. Where are you parked? We walked. Oh, in trouble again, Dr. Mulciber? Sweetling! What happened to your face? Hey, fuck you. I mean... Save the smooth talking for later, choker. We've gotta get outta here. There she is, fire at will. There! Hey, need a ride, dude? Come on! Get in, come on, quick. Thanks. Awkward. The anesthetic is wearing off. Will you help me sleep? Certainly, sweetling. Thanks for the ride. - Thank Wes, I would have let the guards have you. Thanks, Wes. No problem. You guys rocked. Yeah. Good night. We're off to a gig in Let us know where to drop you off. Where are we going? In my visions, I saw walls of barbed wire and fats of human flesh. Camps. Dragos is reptilian. So I presume his lair would be underground. Guernica. My thoughts exactly. What's that? It's the largest of the concentration camps from The Silent War. Legend has it, the military brass built a huge tunnel system underneath. Why? Who knows? Wake me up when we get there. Actually, the military built the cap on top of the tunnel system, which was already there. The tunnels with a layer of Bafomet from millennia. Dragos must've taken it over after the coming of the Starkiller. That's Starkiller stuff's a bunch of crap.. You think so? I'm game for the hunt because star killer relics are worth a fortune but I've been all around the wasteland and I ain't never see nothing to make me believe in no Starkiller. If there are tunnels under Guernica, they're military tunnels You've lived through the return of the fallen god's surely? That don't equal the existence of a Starkiller. You're being blind. What do you think, kid? My mom was taken during the Armageddon. Sucks for you. Wake me up when we get there. Are you all right? I'm trying to turn invisible. Sorry. You don't turn invisible, Tommy. It's quite the opposite. Instead of exerting force, you withdraw force. You relax your atoms so the light can penetrate instead of being repelled. You've gotta be kidding me. How else did you slip free of those handcuffs? Oh, please, it's a parlor trick. I just shift the bones in my hand. Same principle. Whatever. Visibility's for people afraid to fight. Good skill for the choker, I guess. Instruct away. I'm not a choker. You're stiffening, Tommy. It contracts the atoms, relax. Don't let your emotions control you. Once you allow light to pass through you, you can learn to allow the things to pass through you as well. Like the atoms that make up a laser, or the atoms that make up a wall. A wall? Would you like to walk through walls? Wow. Thanks again. This place is creepy. I almost feel guilty leaving you here. Wes, why are we not moving? Well, good luck down there. Have a good trip. Yeah, you too, hope it ends well for ya. That isn't working, is it? Well, why don't you just walk through the fence, dillinger? Walking through an electrified fence is a whole different principle. Then unless you know the open Sesame here I suppose I'm gonna keep trying to pick this lock. Sorry. What? I was just surprised before. I never thanked you. What do you think they built this fence for? What? To keep people out or to keep people in? They're never gonna get that open. You have any ideas? About what? How to get in? How should I know, I'm not educated, you know? You've got, you know, speed smarts. I mean like, have you ever been called in to entertain troops? Yeah. Well, you didn't walk in the front door, did you? You're suggesting there's a service entrance for hookers. Who knows? This is an internment camp. So? I personally never did anything like this. I mean, I wasn't doing this kind of thing before Beezal got a hold of me. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean... But Angelfuck used to tell me some stories. She was working in a military bunker in LA when the first suitcase nuke went off. Oh shit. The tactical blast, not the strategic. Anyhow, yeah, they brought her in a different entrance. Was it like a buried door or something? No, no, not that secret. Remember these places were built during the silent war. They hid everything in plain sight. What is this, an outpost? I don't know. It's like a registration room or something. So weird. - It's not even computers. It's just these paper spreadsheets, lists of people. Guess they were prisoners. Answers the question of whether that fence is keeping people out or in. Poor bastards. Name, number, blood, hey come here. What are these symbols in the blood mean? Mission accomplished. Hidden in plain sight. You're a genius. I hope so. I'll be needing a new line of work soon. What do you mean? Oh, you can wear a mask or stars and ink. Doesn't change a thing. When you smile it's like everything just kind of stops. Is that a good thing? Oh yes. No making out on the job. Unless it's with me. We weren't... I wasn't talking to you. Well now, what have we here? Another interest. We think it's the service entrance. Fascinating. We've been outwitted by the youngers. Yeah, they could've mentioned it before that surge hit me. Scopes, I'm sorry. Why do you keep saying that? What? Scopes, what does that mean? Oh, I don't know, we all just say it. It's an odd bit of lingo. Actually a reference to the Scopes Monkey Trial. This is all incredibly fascinating. Must not let that bounty hunter get ahead of us. - What the hell is the Scopes Monkey Trial? Monkey. Naroch. You know him? No one knows him. Wait here. If he leads me in, follow closely, but do not be seen. Something's sucking the about blood out of his hands. He's paying a toll Uh, so I guess we follow them. What is that? What, what is it? Big money, that's The Maitreya. What's The Maitreya? Half million in bounty. Ah, it's Disgusting. That'll look awesome hanging over my fireplace. You can't fight it. Bullshit. You'll get us all caught. We had a deal. I take all bounties. Why don't you lure away from the door? We'll slip in and you can fight it farther down the tunnel. She's crazy. The oceans weep, the skies bleed. The suns screams and Mulciber enters. Did you bring the boy? I did. It defies me. The gods must wish to receive the message. I care not for the wishes of gods. Approach my throne. I shall not kneel. Theatrics are for the weak Mulciber. I let you live for your wisdom, not your ridiculous attempts at power. - You see a difference between wisdom and power? Your wisdom, Mulciber, can unlock the secrets of the Nibiru Box. My wisdom, however, tells me that you will refuse the task even if by suck the marrow from every bone in your body. Which I could very much enjoy. What this situation requires is leverage. The Furies' Blade. You will unlock the secrets of the Nibiru Box. Or I shall sever your soul from its flesh and cast you off to suffer among the Furies'. Oh no. Tommy. Don't move. Mulciber! Shut up. So refreshing to smell such fresh blood. I understand my dear friend Mulciber has been instructing you. Surely you've graduated beyond his teachings by now. You are ripe for a lesson in power, I believe. The blessed Virgin Tommy One of the holiest wonders of the world. There is one in every thousand who won't die. No matter how brutal my assaults. Those wretched elites, I cast down there. I feed them fresh human kills and living prisoners. Bloodlings for life. They're always hungry. Can you see the future old friend? Is it bleak? Wisdom is cheap. Beg your God for mercy. I know what you're thinking. The old man doesn't deserve it. Let me explain something to you. There is not a single human being indigenous to this earth who deserves anything less. You carry on the blood debt of your race. You are the last generation of your kind and you must swallow the suffering your forebears have unleashed. I care not for fires raising within, but if you are as strong as they say, young Starkiller Then I look forward to meeting you again. Look upon death's jaws before she devours you. Let her consume you slowly. If they escape let them go, but follow them. Oh fuck! Oh no. Mulciber! They ate him? What the fuck are those things? You got any ideas? Ideas, no. Come on, think of something. I got nothing. Do something. You can't fight them with Mulciber's bones as weapons, it's horrible. Stop being such a pussy. Okay. Halfpipe, no! Halfpipe. Come on, you can do it, it's gonna be all right. Wake up, wake up. Oh no. Oh fuck. A door, come on. We can get out. Come on, come on. No, locked! What am I gonna do? They're coming. Think, think, think. I can start a fire. At least that might hold them off long enough. And if I can't get this door open, it'll be our funeral. No, no. They all left me. Fucking Soledad, Mulciber, even Halfpipe. I have to get her out of here. Come on, come on, come on. Goddammit. It's not solid. It's not solid. It's not solid. It's not solid. It's not solid. It's not solid. It's not solid. It's not solid. Dammit. It's just fucking sand, goddammit. What are you doing? I'm trying to walk through the wall. The fuck are you talking about? There's no time for you to go all skitzo on me here. No, I'm not crazy, Mulciber told me how. Well, try slow. Try just your hand. I can do it, I can do it. It's just sand on the beach, sand on the beach. Concentrate, you can do it. Sand on the beach. It's just sand on the beach. It's just, just sand on the beach. It's working! It's just sand on the beach. It's just sand on the beach. Dammit. What is it? The inhibitor ring won't go through. Get it off. I can't. Use your other hand. The other one's even worse. It's full of metal, see if you can get it off. Bite it off. I'm trying. No, bite my finger off. What? There's no time, just do it. Do it, do it. Sand, sand, sand. Sand, sand, sand, I'm almost through. Tommy! The fires dying, they're coming. I got it. Tommy! Fuck, I can't concentrate. I gotta get it out, I can't... Tommy! Holy fuck. Come on, come on. It's gonna be okay, I'll get you out of here. I can't hold them. Tommy! I'm coming. Soledad. What was that screaming? He's hurt, bad. Have you got the box? It's in there? What are those things? Cannibals zombie virgins. I'll be right back. Okay, come on. Come on, Halfpipe. Come on! And how long have you been having these dreams, Tommy? Like I said, I only remember the past couple of nights. Pretty much since your accident? Yes, sir. I want you to keep a dream journal. Bring it to our meetings, will you do that? Of course I will, sir. Very good, Tommy. Oh Lucy, what happened? Can I remember anything from last week? Just these crazy dreams. Ah, stupid broken bed. Oh no, what did I do now? - I can't feel my finger. I can't feel my, I can't feel the pain. Metal, my finger is metal? It wasn't a dream.
