I'VE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO, UH, CONSOLIDATE SOME OF THESE BRANCHES. SO... HOW CAN I HELP? CARL TALKED ME INTO THIS LOAN. HE TOLD ME THAT, UM, HE COULD GET ME INTO MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE FOR NOTHING AND THAT I SHOULDN'T BE PAYING SOMEONE ELSE'S MORTGAGE, AND HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN IT TO ME, AND I-I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT. AND THEN A COUPLE YEARS LATER, THE RATES CHANGE ENTIRELY, AND I -- HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN. I DIDN'T -- CAN -- CAN I JUST -- CAN I JUST CUT ACROSS YOU FOR A MOMENT, THERE? LISTEN, I-I AM ALL EARS, BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK UP A LITTLE BIT, 'CAUSE I AM VERY DEAF. THIS HAPPENS TO BE MY GOOD EAR, BUT ALL I HEARD THEN WAS, "MUH, BLUH, BUH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLUH, BLUH." SO, JUST -- WHATEVER IT WAS YOU JUST SAID, PLEASE, JUST A LITTLE LOUDER. I CAN'T QUITE HEAR IT. I DON'T THINK I EVER SHOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THAT LOAN, AND CARL TALKED ME INTO THAT LOAN. CAN I ASK YOUR NAME? BILLY. OKAY, BILLY. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY TIGHT FISCAL KNOT, AND IT'S SQUEEZING, AND YOU ARE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. NOW, YOU COULD PAY YOUR THREE MONTHS. YOU CAN WALK AWAY WITH SOME MONEY. YOU COULD PAY YOUR THREE MONTHS AND THEN PAY MORE AND MORE, AND YEAH, YOU COULD KEEP THE HOUSE... SO I CAN? ...IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WANNA DO. YEAH, BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO? WHAT SORT OF WORK DO YOU DO? WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND PROMISING. I MEAN, HOW DO YOU PLAN TO -- DO YOU HAVE A PLAN? SEE... ...I HAVE BEEN TO SIX LOST RIVERS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, AND I HEAR THE SAME STORY FROM FOLKS LIKE YOU. NOW, I DON'T KNOW CARL VERY WELL. I ONLY MET HIM FOR A MOMENT, AND THEN I FIRED HIM. BUT IN THOSE PRECIOUS FEW MOMENTS, YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T STRIKE ME AS AN EVIL FINANCIAL GENIUS BENT ON DESTROYING THE AMERICAN DREAM ONE SINGLE MOM AT A TIME, OKAY? OKAY, BUT I'M ACTUALLY NOT INTERESTED IN THE BUYOUT. I'D LIKE TO JUST PAY THE THREE MONTHS AND KEEP THE HOUSE AND STAY IN THE HOUSE. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK WHY? BECAUSE I HAVE TWO BOYS, AND THAT IS OUR HOME, AND -- AND I GREW UP IN THAT HOME, AND THAT IS OUR HOME. LOOK, I CAN MAKE A NOTE FOR YOU, RIGHT? I CAN WRITE A FUCKING NOVEL. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME OF THIS. OKAY. NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO, BUT YOU WANT TO HAVE A THINK ABOUT THAT VERY SERIOUSLY -- WHAT YOU CAN DO, WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO DO. AND YOU'RE A VERY BEAUTIFUL LADY, AND I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO. I'M NOT WHAT I DO. IT'S NOT WHO I AM. EVERYONE'S GOTTA DO THE SHIMMY-SHIMMY-YA. YOU KNOW, I GOT MY LITTLE HUSTLE.
