(in collaboration with SILKY GIRL) (a film from SALMAN ARISTO) Cooking is a journey - Mom ONE DAY Hi, Jurgen. Did you fight with your boyfriend again? What do you mean? Alya, that's not your bicycle. Shit! Thank you. Thank you, Jurgen. Please give it to Donna, your daughter. But, don't put it in the fridge. Chocolate. - Bye, Jurgen. - Bye. Thank you. Why are you still at home? Do you know what time it is? I bought you a digital tuner the other day." I just want to help you. You're the most focused man I've ever known. You are the sexiest, most caring woman with lips tastier than any chocolate I've known." So, is there someone who is not sexy, but caring?" Many are sexy. But, none was caring. I'm sorry. I have a lot in mind. I have a gig in Libra. My strings are dead. I haven't change them, there's no money." About our anniversary... I'm sorry. But, didn't you just sell your hard case? I spent the money to cover our insurance. Okay. Now, just go to Libra. When you get home, my cooking will make you fresh." Don't have this at once. We'll savour this later. Relax, Al. This year Chipmunk won't be late like last year." Actually, Cho and Chip were not late last year. They just came in drunk. Room 203 is all good, right? Cho! So, it's all good, right? Oh, God. Are you saying I'm a hotel manager here out of collusion?" I have the wine you've been wanting for two months." And also... The beer you never bought for your boyfriend." I have it under control. There's a reason I didn't buy him the beer." From the sound of your heels, I know you're still at the hotel." It means you're still in Interlaken. Alya. If you fail to be a chocolatier, you should try state secretariat. And take care of the country? That's lame." Taking care of you, Din, Bima, and juggling work shifts, that's what I call 'advance'! Because I only use my Thai in bargaining for clothes at Chatucak market. So, we just speak English. A silly love story. Hey! Rollie! Study, don't ignore it. You've been sent on a holy trip to Switzerland." Be a good chocolatier. Your family chocolaterie is waiting for you in Jakarta. Just hurry up, or the salted eggs are off-limits for you." I've told you. I don't want tourists from China. Are you a racist? No. I'm not a racist. I'm just not in the mood. I thought it'll be good for you. You can take my money. I'm going now. - Bye. - Bye. Chip, don't miss the train again like last year." Unless you want Alya to boil you. Don't forget the Rawon (Beef Black Soup) ingredients." - Klawuk nuts. - It's kluwak nuts, honey. And if you meet Bima later, don't tease him about his music. That's mean, how do I have fun then? Okay. Don't forget the train and luwak (mongoose). Kluwak nuts. - Alya. - Hey. It's winter outside, but it feels so hot in here. Din. What's wrong, Al? There's nothing to hide. It's just me. You're annoying. You... You're always late. Now, you early. If I were late and you blamed me, I'd understand." But, being early and still get blamed... That's weird. On the road, driving too slow is as dangerous as driving too fast." It's no fun when everything is just right, too predictable. You know I go offroad. Yes, you don't take public road." See, you know that. - Is Bima home yet? - Not yet. Help yourself to drinks. Yes, I'll get it later. What? Nothing. I'm just watching you do all those stuff. Alya. You're a great cook. You're supposed to know which ingredients are good." How can you have the same ""meat"" for three years?" Do you mean Bima? Yes. Of course. You're a brilliant cook. Bima is... The best. The best? How do you know when there's no one to compare to?" You've only ever been with him. You could say the best if you had the comparison." You never tried anyone else. Better mine than yours. You sleep every bed, but always end up with Cho." It's wasting time, Din. It's wasting your future. Your mouth is as sharp as a blender. You said I'm a cook. That's why. With your looks, Al. You can feast high-quality "meat." You deserve Kobe, not even Wagyu. Instead, it's the poor cow. It's up to you if you want to defend the poor cow." So, what are you? I'm in the fruit family. - Hey, Honey. - Hey, Poor Cow. Hi. You smell like cigarettes. Better cigarettes than another woman's perfume. Hey, rockstar! I'm right here. You didn't even say 'hi' to me. He smells like cigarettes? Hey. Bimbo! Why don't you play your own song at the Thun stairs?" It's great over there. It's better than just being someone else's mic," and smelling like cigarettes. - Thank you. - See? If I wanted to busk, I could do it in Blok M. I wouldn't fly out here." You're not the one to fly, Bimbo. It's your integrity that should be flying. To be meaningful once, and to die after. It's a quote by Chairil Anwar for you. What does this means? Stand by for a gig in Bier Haus tonight. Are you going to play in Bier Haus? That's awesome. Is it the Bier Haus we talked about in..." Okay. You're not going to tell me? It's on stand-by. I chose our dinner. You chose? You chose our dinner? So, if they asked you to play, you wouldn't go?" I didn't get night shift by chance today. I had to break my shift into two. For us, for our anniversa... These kind of things. What do you mean? So, I'm the one who's being childish? I'm the difficult one, is that what you mean?" You chose your broken guitar neck over me who was sick..." It was just diarrhea. You already went to the doctor, and you were asleep." Come on. We've been on this a hundred times. Since when did you start vlogging? I'm just about to start, okay? Talk to me, tell me. No? What am I to you? A bus station? Do you think this apartment is just a junkyard?" Just a transit, you sleep here and that's it?" We've been this for three years. Do you understand a damn thing about me? No, you don't. Three years and you never once... Three years? Three years and I still get a 'never'? Never? Bima! Alya. Are you okay? I thought you only come here after a bad gig." Alya doesn't know. Three years. But you guys have been through a lot, - and survived from... - Yes, we survived. We survived from each other. Not for each other. Calm down. Just now, you said Bima is the best. It's just funny. Everytime I had a fight, you became the tamer. How about my late night heartpour? Bima. Do you know? You came here to be with Alya by raising money from all your musician friends in Jakarta. That always gives me chills. It's alright. Yes, it's okay. Alya. Come on. Okay? Calm down. Alya. She's lucky. Meanwhile my boyfriend is Din the Explorer. Good thing his hair bangs are not... It tastes like milk. Well. Okay. Hey. Hi, Chip. Are we sleepy? We do it tomorrow, okay? Chip. How did it go? Well, you know. You? You know. Chip, I'm going to sleep, okay? Okay. Wake me up in the morning, alright? Cho. Thank you for keeping Bima company last night. Don't mention it. It's just me. I want to apologize. Din must... Din must've left you. You know how he is. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hello. - Hello. Do you play Top 40 songs? He can do more than that, Roman. He can do Billboard 100 songs. No problem. I agree to meet you because Timmy has been a great help. And there are five spots left. Roman, I've told you last night that he's.. At the moment, only afternoon slot is available. It's the time when Bier Haus becomes rough. Good luck. Wish me luck! I have an audition. Pray I don't end up at the bridge. Thank you. How about if I play my own song to make this afternoon fresh? Just sing the songs we know. What about a Katy Perry song for the girl in the back. Hi. Hi. What did Roman say? Okay. But he has to fix the schedule first. It's okay, the important thing is he knows you. Roman is like the Pope of the music scene here. All of his references work like magic. I know that... Your hotel is near. But did you really have to come here? Well. Because I knew I was the only one who would come here. Bim, you could crash at my place. I work late at the hotel tonight Din knows I'll be working late, so... He must be at some other girl's nest. I don't have special tea or homemade cookies. But, I'm sure it's better than staying by the bridge. Or at the station. Is everything okay? Is there enough sugar? Marwin. Marwin. Please. Marwin. I always bring a lot of tourists to your restaurant. Chip, can you come to the hotel at seven? It's about us. Urgent. This message is not your favorite novel that you can only read. But, are you sure you won't be slap by your date again? Like that Brazilian. Remember. This restaurant has a tradition I have to keep. That was last month. This one is Asian. Sweet and gentle. Marwin, please. - Okay, Okay. - Okay? Thank you, my friend. I owe you one. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hello, Beautiful! She doesn't look like Asian. Italian, for lunch. - Hi. - Hi. Send email to the media. They're waiting for the interview rules. Waiting for the interview rules. Meet me at Kamasutra, honey. Then, we'll enjoy Bern at night. New position. Do you want to give it a shot? That's the only thing you have inside your head. No apology. At least, make up excuses, you can lie for all I care. You're two hours late. What is happening? What's wrong with you? What do I mean to you? Are you telling me that you finally read the books I recommended.. We're over. What's wrong? Katy Perry? You should've seen it. A teenager got on stage. So happy, I think just got out of jail. Honey. You should have someone to protect you during those moments. So Tatiana's permission wouldn't go to waste. I'm offering you a new recipe for us. And the old recipe? It got burnt together with our anniversary dinner. Do you want to hear it? Hey, Princess. I'll be waiting at Marwin's tea house. From now on, I'll stick up for you. I want to be your manager. We can be together. Build our new relationship that is more... More delightful. Who is it, honey? Bima, I broke up. Good morning. Bima is still asleep. Alya. Wake up! Bima worked on his music all night. What are you doing? What? What are you doing? Enough. Hey, your manager is making a vlog for her artist so that... His career will end because his girlfriend's parents report him to Child Protective Services when they see this video on YouTube. Honey. Did you forget for Jakarta we don't exist? You haven't called home for a long time. I'll just make you a script and you shoot it yourself. Yesterday, I made you a twitter and path account. The password is our anniversary. What's wrong? It's catchier. I can use it to sell honey, too. It's lame. That's why you need a manager. Are you going to Libra? I'll go to Bern, okay? Your tea. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's bitter. Sugar is not good for your vocal chords. A moral message from the chocolatier. Why are you going to Bern? I'm the new manager, so I have to mingle. Your study? I have nothing. And then breakfast with Cho, Bern, then work. Don't mingle with the wrong crowd in Bern. It'll be hard if you become a junkie. You would want to control the rehab center. No way. Why do I have red roses? They're from Cho. Did you forget? Katarina. Broke up? Bima didn't tell you? You'd rather tell Bima? Isn't it the same? It's just tiring. Men. That means we can have a slumber party again at your place. I think we have outgrown that. Thanks for the key. But I don't need it. What time will you be at the hotel? Just come to my place, Bim. Where is you boss? Look whose cake he's eating? Come here. Jack is answering a call from LA. Jack said Tatiana's friend is his friend. Thank you. I still have to see him play. Are you free? I can call him. Rin. Rin. Chorina. Chorina. Rin. What? Why are you whispering? You're in Libra, right? Yes. But I'm in the bathroom. Um, okay. You go to Bern now, you have an audition at cafe... Audition? Which cafe? Cafe Mokka. Claude Nobs' hideout. Yes. The founder of Montreux Jazz Festival, right? I told you that. What are you doing there? Hello, Bim? Just hurry, I'll be waiting. Why didn't you ask me first? Libra heard about my audition in Bier Haus yesterday. I feel bad to the management. Honey, Libra is too small for you. Says who? You. One of manager's job desks is to communicate. Learn that first. Rin. Rin. Chorina. Hello? Hello Al, where are you? Are you at the campus or apartment? I'm at work. Why? Nothing. Mom is at the hospital. But, is she okay? As usual, it's her acid reflux. I took her to Dharmais Hospital. Now, she's on IV. Let me skype her. Is she awake? We're at the hospital. She's on IV and now asleep. Wait. Mom just woke up. Wait. Hello, darling. Hello, Mom. Don't worry. I just didn't eat well. I ate gado-gado in Ciragil and forgot about the chilli. How are you? I'm fine. Don't you worry about me. You're always like that. Remember you can't eat too much chilli. Yes, darling. I'd better rest now. Wait, Dad wants to talk you again. Alya. Study well, okay. Come home soon. Take over our shop from Mom. It's too tiring for her. You know the business is tough nowadays. People are more into coffee shops. Okay, Dad. Keep me posted, okay? Okay. Take care. Okay, Dad. Good thing your kitchen knife is not as sharp as Alya's. Good thing no syringe was involved. If there was any, now we'll be in the airport. I'll be the one taking you home to Jakarta. I'm the one who broke it off, but then I felt lost. Bima. Can you do me a favor? What is it? Please don't tell Alya. Especially Din. Please. Okay. Who is it? Your best buddy, whose money you took. And now, needs a place to stay. Oh God, Din. When are you going to learn how to treat women rightly? But I'm the best for women. Come on, Rollie. Open the door. Shit! Bima, I want to request a song. Your favorite old song? Classic. Sheila on 7 is a classic. Then, Din is a classic. What? You're lame. You've always been like this. In every worst moment of my life, you're around. Hey. Last night I stayed at Timmy's. I just charge my cell phone. How's your mom? She's better. Why didn't you tell me Cho and Din broke up? You know those two. Do you remember when they had a huge fight? It was more intense than Korean drama. Suddenly, they were sleeping together again just like that. No assignments on Saturday? Alya. I need time to adjust you into my world. Bima. You need to know I only have good intention. Since when don't I know you have good intention? The problem is not the intention. Do you not understand? I need time. Don't forget you have rehearsal... The way you're so relaxed with Din. It gave me... chills. What are you talking about? Actually I'm speaking for 60 percent of foreign Asian male in Interlaken. We don't have chills, but we are envious. What about the other 40 percent? They're casting spells on you. Too bad the spirits can't go across the ocean. So, why are you suddenly so sweet and asked me out for lunch? You kept me company at the bridge, dropped by the Bier Haus, and offered me you house key. I think lunch is just lame. How can I repay you for pulling me out of the shower last night? Or you like it in a lame way? Let's just eat burgers at Hooters. I feel like having a very big burger. Come on. I need energy just in case the spells work. Bima. She's not here. Do you think Alya will blink like a genie if you glance at that girl? This place has a bad taste in processing comodities, she said. Be it one that is alive like that or the dead one like this. But I have practice and vlogging on my schedule as well. Since when you have a schedule? But... You don't seem happy about it. I mean, I have a schedule to simplify things. So, I'm pleased about that. The most important thing is... Is that really what you want? So, you haven't create the vlog? It's more important meeting David in the radio station. Checking chart prediction for Libra later. Bima, I've been thinking. I have my own way. And you're supposed to support that. If you still wanted to be my manager. Is that a threat? I know I'm still learning. But, I'm doing what's best for you. Maybe it's you who don't actually want this. We have to talk about this more serious... Chorina. Why does the name of that Iranian is still in the guest list. You haven't told the committee? Please wait, Jonas. I'm part of the committee. It means I know how important this film festival for our hotel image. Whatever. But I heard that person has political issue in the country. Do you want me to cancel the film festival venue here? Jonas. I understand. You're my boss. But do you want Switzerland which is known as neutral to look cowardice? Alya. Alya. I know you're there. I met your neighbor, Benny. He said, Alya. Look under the door. Look at the logo below. Finally. Good evening. What did you say to Mr.Smith? Do you really want to know? It was a dreadfully long conversation. It can be longer than my 13 chapter novel. Or you'll lose respect. when you know what that old bastard had asked me. Do you want to know? Hey. Alya. What are you doing? What are you doing? Whatever you do you can't erase what already happened. Or... This can be ghostly and kill everything. Okay. Tomorrow I have work in Jungfraujoch. You've never been there, right? You and Bima are afraid of heights. If you won't to conquer that ghost, I'll be at the station tomorrow morning. Good night. You were right. You had a fight again? I should've chosen what I wanted. I want a trip that can conquer a ghost. Is it still available? Well. The tickets were sold out. But, I've prepared this. Come on. I'll just stay here. You've come so far to just stay there? Come here, hold my hand. Come on. Do it slowly. Slowly. Din. I don't want you to be a ghost. I'm not planning to die soon. You can't trust ghosts. Oh, no. Are you really talking about trust with me? What I know about you is that you want to be a tour guide. You want to be the winner of Nobel Prize in Literature. Or likes to pick on Bima. Or... Vaguely dating Chorina, it did last for five years. Trust is priceless. But what you're selling all these times... I became an orphan when I was five. We went on vacation to Brastagi. A car accident. Until today, I keep asking God, to Allah, Buddha, Jesus, or whatever people call Him. Why was I the only one who survives? I kept moving around. Living with my grandparents. With my aunt. With my uncle and aunt. My sense of trust is depleting. Because after a while. we became distant. How did it became distant? My parents wealth that they took is diminishing. I got used to foreign places, strangers. God, I'm such a soap. Let's head down. Is that for getting more instragram followers? I don't have many followers, they're all Indonesian. Actually this looks like Sumatra, but with snow. Looks fun, right? It's quite musical. The Tamil from India, they like singing. Well, they can sing songs that people know, everyone can sing along. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai? Yes, everyone can sing. You want to sing? No, I mean... A song is fun when everyone is happy and can sing along. Hey, he speaks our language. How about an Indian song that people here know? Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, maybe? How come? Actually, I don't really like playgrounds. Really? Is it because... it takes too much adrenaline or... Is it dangerous or what? So when I was a little, my sister and I went to a playground near our house. The size... maybe this is only a quarter of that. Bigger than this one? It has all kinds of rides. The swings were tall and wide. It was real fun. The slide was a bit curvy. Yes. We were kids. I played and lost track of time. I was too excited to realize my sister was gone. Really? Missing. For six hours. Was your sister okay? Well, that's why. After that I wasn't to be trusted anymore. I don't see it that way. About you not being trustworthy. You were sent here after all. I was forced. Actually, chocolate is not my passion. Not really. Well. The reason you were sent here is to run family business. It means... you are trusted. Hey. Hi. I don't know the good mixture of tea and hot water. Alya, I want to... I haven't finished. But I know. I want to play at Mokka. Really? - But I need a time alone to... - Whatever. I mean... The arrangement is all up to you. Then you can tell me, so I can take care of it. Take this off, honey. Is it really that cold? - Hi. - Hi. I heard the fashion show is a big hit. Yes. A guest was arrested in Langstrasse for... drugs. He was supposed to be picked up for the Asia Pacific Film Festival. How much did you drink? I think the wine started kicking in, let's eat. Anthony Bourdain? You want to be like him? That's awesome. You read Nat Geo, right? I've read it there, every day as we speak, a language goes extinct. So are food recipes. Meanwhile, all civilizations in the world begin as food is being cooked. I want to find that. Then, why didn't you? How come I didn't know this? The chocolaterie, my family. I can't make them portable. What do you mean? Actually, I don't want people to know this. Especially you. - I read Bourdain's A Cook's Tour. - Good. Should anyone understand, - it would be you. - That's it. Yes, but of all people around me now. I don't want that. Did you forget who brought your cake to Daiki Hayakawa? I was hoping Bima'd do that. Well... But I know what his reaction would be. He'll say, you're selfish. Think about your family. And so on. But it annoys me that he's right. You'll understand that. It's like when you're arguing with Chorina, and she wins. I'm the winner. Rain must be female. We called it rintik. If it's male, it'll be rontok. Rain drops on to the ground, then disappears. It's like missing someone. If you're with the person, the feeling is gone. The feeling dries. But then, you would miss once again. (Queen of Raindrops) - Dad. - Alya. Dad, what's wrong with Mom? She's okay. Your mother is fine. I just want t say you don't have to go home this semester break. I'll be visiting you there. Did you forget? Five months ago, I asked you to contact Schuh Chocolaterie in Interlaken for a collaboration. It's okay, you're busy. I'll contact them directly. I'll arrange a meeting there and make the deal. Okay? Remember your purpose there. What have you done to serve that purpose? - Yes, but I'm not just... - Alya, it's getting bad. The connection is getting bad. You take care. I'll let you know when exactly I'll be coming. Take care. Okay. Bye. (Sweety, I'm coming to pick my stuff up. Have you had dinner?) (Tomorrow morning. I'll leave key with Albert.) You are my queen of raindrops Crowned by fuzzy rainbow You dance the lines of tears Before you disappear Upon the staying scars My queen of raindrops My queen of raindrops It's good. But why is it sad? So the queen of raindrops disappears upon, what? Upon the staying scars? Am I like that? This is my message for you. So you won't do that again. You don't need to run under the shower again. Do you really have to? These are really good. I can only make lyrics like that here. Albert, my friend. Did you just finish a new game last night? This time it's for real, huh? Tough love. We're fine. Is your camera still working? Sorry, Cho. I'll take a raincheck. It's hectic at the campus. I didn't know that you're still... My dad is angry. He said he's coming here to deal with the chocolate collaboration that I should've take care a long time ago. You have to go to Mocha alone. I have to go to Schuh Chocolaterie. But I don't know Jack. But Schuh Chocolaterie is more important. And you are? Bima, from Alya. That's not Jack, right? That's Jack. Just make sure you're great. He'll be in a good mood again. Thank you. Am I hearing this correctly? Are you drunk? Forming a band? Adrian and Steve. We still play on weekdays. That's crazy. You've never been that gutsy. I'm under pressure. You're not under pressure. But, you're free. How does it feel to listen to your heart? It's great, isn't it? Are you really still together Chorina? Are sure you didn't miss Bima when he came? I'm not feeling comfortable. They're my friends, too. You know how Swiss people always said, every family should... Take care their own disgrace. I think of you as family. You are my brother. Come on. Give that bullshit to someone else. Okay. You have a week. After that, all this Sherlock shit is done. Okay. Here. Since you first got here, you've never lived alone? Never. I came here because I thought I had a place to call home. Maybe... It's time for you to have your own home. Look what you've done. It's okay. They might put me on the blacklist. No. This place is too quiet. It needs some noise. Actually, I'd rather work here than Schuh. No problem. Don't worry about that. Now our job is to make Schuh Chocolaterie surrender to you. So the keyword for Schuh itself is tradition, it dates back to the 1800s. So, we have to make your roots on chocolate strong. Don't you worry. We're in a place brighter than crystal. No one cares. - Hi. - Hi. Aren't you cold up here? It's okay. Congratulation, I heard the news. I'll confirm it again... I've taken care of everything. So, what about Schuh? I'm making a proposal with Kat. By the way, are you sure with these two guys? I told you. Okay. Now, I'll be managing all of you. Not just you. Adrian is Filipino. He's been touring playing piano for five years. Steve plays cajoun. He's Taiwanese. We use the name Asiarama. Bima. Actually, I'm preparing you to be a solo artist. Are you writing a new song? You're not using your cheat sheet. You're right. It's cold here. What else do you want, Chorina? I never asked for anything all this time. I know your mine business is slow. The house in Brungasse won't be used anymore. So, I'll take the keys directly to Uncle Rudi. Thank you. Rolland. Do you want to play your song? Delete all. No. I've promised Din. Delete, Albert. This is a disgrace. Just think about it first. This is house used to be for my mother's business partner. We're not living together. I remember clearly. You argued with Din. You said, Music exists because it stops. It exists not because it keeps on going. I guess, you needed that from Alya. A rest. There's nothing between Chorina and Bima. I don't want to be involved anymore. Din, this is pathetic. I know you broke up with Chorina. Let it go. Alya. I forgive you for disappearing today. But the compensation better be worth it. I want to talk. Here's the thing. You want to break up? Is that what you want to talk about? Bima. We have made it so far for so long. That's right. That's why... But we forgot to stop. Like a stove that kept burning. It was hot. - Emotional. - That's is why I... I'd like to propose a new recipe. I need space. We should split. We have our own space to find new flavors. Yes. Do you see that girl? She's an editor from McGruw-Hild. McGruw-Hild? Publishing company. Her first vacation in Interlaken. Are you sure you want to take the day off? I googled her. McGruw-Hild has published many novelists. Something happened. I'll tell you later. Too ambitious. But I understand youth. That is good. Thank you. Your father will arrive next week, right? Where's that Melanesian who said she can cook? Indonesian, Franz. Indonesian, Melanesian. It's all the same. If you want Schuh chocolate, you have to prove yourself in my kitchen. I take care only the administratives. But when it comes to recipes, you talk to Franz. Sorry, I'm still at rehearsal. The private party has to wait, okay. I borrowed your tea. The editor likes tea! Wait for me, the author, tonight! - Din Din, Are you ready to pitch? You haven't prepared anything. I'll tell you later. I hope we're on the same page. Distance pulls me in, not away from you. Where are you? How come you can pick me up? You're not working? Tatiana gave me permission. Don't do that. It's unprofessional. Have you met Franz? It's quiet here. There's only the shower. Now don't wear any clothes under the shower. I trust you. I have to rehearse. I have a gig this weekend. Igor. One day. Dad. You're the one who's afraid of heights, not me. Why did you insist bringing me here? Cooking is a journey - Mom Your 18th birthday present? That's what I want, Dad. Not just making chocolate. Or... Running a chocolaterie. I want to... I want to travel the world looking for recipes. Looking for dishes. Going to Japan looking for the oldest tea. Going to Tibet looking for the best Thukpa. Or to Magelang looking for Lesah that's almost extinct. Cooking is a journey. Why are you only telling me now? You had this book for more than 10 years. I'm not afraid of heights anymore. I can't make chocolate as honest as Mom. I'll still go. That's my daughter. Go. Go as far as you can. Write a better book than Anthony Bourdain's. Say goodbye to Mom. But don't tell her I cried. Your daughter, her journey, she's more courageous now. Mom. I want to return the keys from the other day. Just return the keys to Uncle Rudi. Mom. Have I ever hurt you? Remember when you were in primary we saw a UFO? No one believed us, we became the joke in the family. You're my daughter, Chorina. Your two words made me can't sleep. Thank you, Mom. Aren't you used to sleeping late? Never because of you. I've never seen you that disappointed. Okay. I want to fix all of this now. Let's get married. I'm serious. Are you crazy? You're an asshole. Did you know? I fell into the deepest pit. On the bottom is always you. Which book did you read this time? My book or what? I read this. Have you ever really read my heart and yours? I want more than the old us. Making love on the first date. Well. So, now what? I want process. Take it slow. Reading each other. But, there will be misreading, mislearning... You're my best risk. Take it slow. Just a kiss. First step at Thun Queen of Raindrops Can I sing my own song in Indonesian? This song is for the most important person in my life. Maybe, One Day Maybe, one day The promises I made would touch you Maybe, one day I would have the space to comfort you Maybe, one day After the victory against my own misery Maybe, one day After the triumph against dream's biggest mystery I know you cheated with Chorina. But I also cheated with Din. All these times. I made an illusion that chasing you is chasing a dream. Actually, I'm running away. Scared. Looking for a comfort zone. I have to learn how to brave first. I want to go back to Indonesia. I'm also leaving. I have to travel. If you want to find me, you know where to find me. I'm sorry for asking to meet in such short notice. I'm afraid we won't have time.
