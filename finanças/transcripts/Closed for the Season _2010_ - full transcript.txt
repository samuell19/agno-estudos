Hey! What are you doin'? Come on, kid, park's closin', but I'll run it one more time for ya Or uh... are you scared? We only came here once a year and I'm always too small to ride Well, you're big now. Big chicken! Bok, bok!, Bok, bok! Bok, bok! It's the ride of your life. How's your seat? You're right, it's a lot scarier up here. Whoo! Go! Wow! I ain't never seen nothin' like that before. And you're still alive. Wow. He threw me off. Who? The man on the roller coaster. Didn't you see him? Son, you was the only one ridin' it. There was a man. Well, you musta hit your head, but that's the least of your problems. That must hurt somethin' awful. I- I can't feel a thing. Can you feel that? That? How about that? Phew. That thing musta gone clear through your spine. Get me outta here. That would hurt too much, You're better off where ya are. I'm sorry kid, but this is the most goddamn amazing thing I ever seen. I'm just sorta transfixed by the sight of it. But don't worry now, I'll-, I'll go get help. Just don't move. I guess that won't be happenin'. But keep that thing pokin' through you, because that keeps too much blood from leaking out. It's what they call a blessing in disguise. Don't worry, you'll live, that's what's horrible about it. Can't you read? What do you mean, "Closed for the season"? We were just here yesterday. Well, that was the last day. That's because of that accident, isn't it? There wasn't any accident, unless losing money year after year is an accident. Look, my daughter left something in the picnic area yesterday. Can't we just go in and get it? I can't do that. We don't wanna stay. We wanna get what she left here. I'm sorry, ma'am, I got rules to follow. Is five minutes gonna kill ya? What are you looking for? My bear. You're sort of small to hold a bear, aren't you? A toy bear. Don't know about that. But there are bears in these woods around here. Quick, hide, before he gets ya! I'm too old to be fooled. There's no real bear. You're never too old to be fooled. See ya next time! Help me! Help, please! Help me! Get me out of here! How could this happen? Please help me. I'll-I'll go get help. No, don't! I- I can't do this myself. I'll be right back. Don't! It's dangerous! It's like a roller coatser of blood. Oh. Is anybody in there? Damn it! Damn it! Oh my god! This can't be happening! Stop! You're right, this isn't real. Hey you! Come back here! Unsafe building! KEEP OUT! Keep out! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Help me! Please help me! Whoa! Please let me in! Please help me! What? What, wait a minute. Go to the door. I can't hear you. Please let me in! Uh, you'll wake my parents. What's wrong? There's, there's a man. Help me! He needs help! Yeah! Okay, just a sec. He was right here. Could he have run off looking for help? - Not the way he was. - He was that badly hurt? He-there was a tree stuck through him. But there's no blood. And I know the whole thing sounds massively crazy, I admit. No, I heard someone calling too. Let's just be quiet, listen again, look around. Do you hear it? Sounds like the roller coaster, doesn't it? Or would that be massively crazy too? Did you see the skeleton in the tree? There used to be more of them all around here. This was called the "Giant's Park". Captain Brody, the Giant of Seville. He, uh, he fought in the Civil War and he hung all of his enemies in tress until they rotted down to the bones as a warning. Kids over the years stole the ones they could reach. But... this guy escaped. Birds made a nest in his head one year. Maybe he'd have been better off in some kid's basement. I got my hair caught up in it. Well, that might be massively crazy, but there is a plastic skeleton in the tree. So I wanna let that part go. - Was that all you saw? - I was hiding in there... and whatever was chasing me smashed it. Well, these guys can't wait to tear this place down. It'll all be gone in a month. Either they left it running, or some kids were playin' around. I don't know why I saw kids. It's not like I'm much of an adult. Yeah, maybe I'm not either. I don't know what I saw, or how I saw it. That's not what I'm scared of now. Why or how could I have thought this? This place is creepy at night, you know? It gets- What is it? Do you see anything? Uh. Ah, looks like you hit your head pretty hard. Hard enough to see things? - Only you can answer that. - Yeah, but I can't. Well, I don't see any blood, but- But I don't know how I got in there, or what I'm doing here. - Can I guess? - Be my guest. Well, by what you're wearing, it looks like you came here to jog. What do you have in there? Keys to a grey Nissan? Don't be scared, I just looked into the parking lot. I guess that's my car. I- I don't remember parking here or even being here for years, But I do like to find new places to run. Well, you got a different kind of workout than you planned. Yeah, more like a Freak out. Good cardio, freak out. I'd rather buy a treadmill. Go home. You'll wake up tomorrow, remember everything. Or at least more than you do now. I'll let you out. I remember waiting in long lines to get in here. I don't even remember this place being less than packed. I never understood why it closed. All right. Well, I don't have the keys on me... but there's a new hole in the fence I bet you came through. Yeah, okay. My first memory of this place is standing here in line. I was falling asleep on my feet. I must've been like six years old and I got burned on my cheek. Some lady had accidentally burned me with her cigarette. - Did something just happen? - Just let me out of here! Alright, I'll go through first to hold back the wire for you, okay? My first memory of this place is probably this poart of the parking lot. There used to be a guy who had like, a zoo. There was a pit and he used to wrestle alligators in it. I remember that. A friend of mine tried to push me in the pit one time.. - Always doin' stuff like that. - I was more scared of the snakes. The alligators always seemed sleepy to me, like my grandma's old dog. They looked pretty angry to me. That's because the zookeeper was always waking him up. - What was his name? - Jungle Larry. He did a better job of wrestlin' those alligators... - than I'm doin' with this f-ing thing. - Here, let me help you. Okay. that's better. Ah! What? What? Why'd you pull me out, I was almost free! Can't you just get the key and let us out a safer way? Like closer to my car? I know I didn't make that look easy, but it's not that big a deal. No, just get the key. - So, how long's it been since it closed? - 20 years. It was open 100 before that. And why did it close again? You know, the story goes that some mob types bought it, locked the gates one year, put up "Closed for the season" signs. Everything was still inside though. I remember rubbing a clean spot on one of the hotel windows to look in. I REMEMBER RUBBING A CLEAN SPOT The silverware and all the plates were set up, waitin' for an Opening Day that never came. That makes no sense. Couldn't they launder money better if it was still open? Another story says that the mob guys would bring people here to rub them out, bury them under the rides. I don't believe that story. Is that so? Hey, Louie, you believe that story? Only a couple of dumb kids would believe a stupid thing like that. We-we didn't see anything. Yes you did. But that's not gonna make a difference for much longer. I lost a toy here once. Then this'll be a good place to lose somethin' else too. I always wondered why they put a caboose here. Now I know. 'cause it's the end of the line. No, no! Wait, wait! Please, please! Bang. - Hey, you must've tripped on something. - Yeah, like mushrooms. Oh my god. - No, you look like you just saw a ghost. - Maybe I did. You look really freaked out, just calm down. Do I look as freaked out as you did back at the hole in the fence? I thought I saw you get killed. Just a minute ago we were talking about the gangsters. You were saying - I think we should be really careful what we think about. Why? We just saw each other or made each other die. What is going on here? I don't know the answer to that and I don't think I even want to. No matter what craziness we see, or think we see... no more secrets, okay? There are a couple of things I saw that I haven't told you about. Like? The Lake Monster, the last and cheesiest of the exhibits they had here. I was way too much of a girl to see stuff like this. My dad told me about the Lake Monster and I didn't go in a pool... or the lake at night after that. Give me a second and see if I can't find the Lake Monster. See? All that's left of him and all there ever was really? You know, I saw the guy putting this suit on before a show. Me and my friends threw drinks at him when he popped up out of the container. There's no monster, agreed? So everything I've experienced is impossible. I never said that. Is that the guy you saw impaled on the full-sized tree? Definitely. That's Dyrk. I hate this place. He liked to break things and since I was his friend, I did too. I got some, what should I hit? I was there. You guys are gonjna get in trouble for doing that You're not supposed to be in here either. I came in here 'cause I lost my toy bear in here. Have you guys seen it? All of it, I never forgot it. Havin' some problems? Can't get it to light Let me try. I almost git it. Why does this thing keep blowin' out? - Must be the wind. - There's no wind. How'd you like to have somebody burn your house down? - Let's get outta here! - Come on! All I remember is, when we got home... both our houses were on fire, and Dyrk's parents were killed. Isn't that where your house is? It's like the park is protecting itself. I guess so. Kind of ironic that my parents moved here to act as caretakers. Maybe I owe this place somehow. Not that I've been able to stop any of the abuse it's gotten, any more than Dyrk could save his parents. It's better if he doesn't see us. He rolled right in, tried to save his parents. Of course, I was too scared to help. But there was nothing either of us could've done. I pulled him out, but we don't really talk anymore. It's not your fault. It takes a lot less than that to become an angry loner. - You don't look too angry. - I'm having a good day. Well, anyway, he'd always told me how he fell off the roller coaster... and was impaled. But you know, that was when he was a kid. The was no kid I saw. It was like he and the tree... had grown up together. Like he never left. YOU HAD SAID YOU'D, You'd gotten your hair caught up in the skeleton, But one hand't hung down low enough for that to happen in years. No, this just happened, it's like its still happening. How is this any different... from the killings with the alligators, the mobsters? Alright, come on. There's one more thing I can sort of explain. It belonged to the drunken carny who ran the roller coaster. He'd drive it down to Florida in the off season, then come on back up here with all of his stuff packed in it. He practically lived out of the thing while he was here. He died the last season the park was open. They just left it sittin' here. That thing chased me before. Ah! - Just the wind? - Is it ever? Come here. We're waiting. Come on, children-to-be. Don't be distracted by the weeds that you see. They only grow out of the seeds of neglect, here which pleasures the world would forget. No longer to dance or watch colored lights. Instead they prefer their own lonely nights. Lost in a world without echoes of laughter. Fools, hoping instead for something better hereafter. Come back, we're waiting, the rides still abound. You have only to listen, to hear happy sounds. The echoes of games of challenge and chance, You could find a young partner who's willing to dance. Closed for the season, how can that be? Not for the likes of you and me. Here are the rides and a waiting ghostly crowd. Here is the past, don't tell me - no summers allowed. Come on, come closer. But hurry, before the old fortune teller lies dead in the floor, and nobody needs fortunes told no more. I'm so happy to see ya I think I'm gonna cry. AH! Come, come now a little water never hurt anyone. Unless, of course, you mean how the rain and the snow have been raping... and tearing this place to the ground day in and day out for the last 20 years! We had nothing to do with that. You take exception to my presumption, dear lady? So I guess that you and the thousands of others who have not bee coming here have somehow prevented our destruction. Don't know how I got that idea. Do you boys? It's the people who have been coming here, burned down every building... and stolen everything they can! That's a good point, my fine young fellow. I guess that I'm just supposed to positively love those who stay away. I hate it when that happens. Where'd he go? Look at that. Sorry, I can't die again. But I already been there and done that. You're a ghost.. No. The carny died drunk and happy. He's buried in consecrated ground somewhere. I have nothin' to do with that now. What do you mean, you threw my friend off a roller coaster! You almost killed him! Is that what he told you? Well, I'm the killer carny to you, huh? Who am I to you, kristy? You're the carny who tormented me when I was came to look for my doll. Is that what happened? Couldn't the carny in your story been tryin' to help you even? Do you really remember what happened? Quick, hide before he gets you! Or do you just remember the story that you've told... over and over about it ever since? And James, the story you heard about me... comes from your crippled and angry friend, Dyrk. He hated you because you crippled him. If that's what he said in his story, then that's what I did. But don't you find his story a little far fetched? It's a lot scarier up here, whoo! So James, now shouldn't you ask yourself... if Kristy's story's any less crazy, the story of a girl who wakes up... in an abandoned car, at an empty park, doesn't know how she's got there... and then has giants and monsters chasing her? That's a good story, if you like that kind of thing. But real? I mean, a wild story's better that a dull one. Like the guy who wakes up in the middle of the night... reading a book about ghosts... and the most beautiful girl he's ever seen... comes to his window to be saved. I mean - unless it leads to some hot sex at the end, It's hardly worth it at all. It's just as bogus as the girl in the car and the kid in the coaster. My story is true! All stories tell the truth. But it's just words, not facts.. Your stories stopped bein' real the moment you met James... and your story became his story. Or a few minutes ago when you first saw me... that's just a story now It's not still happening. It does here. Things keep happening here. Whether they happen once, or can happen again, They are all real here. It's not real! It's just karma. But this place is haunted. People were killed in a roller coaster accident. The worst one in history at the time. Yeah, sure, right. And what about this here? You ever hear anything about this boat? No. I never even knew it was here. Now let's say that the beautiful Kristy is on the right track... There's nothing alive here except stories. After something happens, that's all there is. The stories are the only truth that can still be experienced. A boat story is simple enough. It floats, nobody ever got killed here. It is this place that died. It is the evil forgetful world that killed it and it is far worse. When this boat floated, this is what you'd see when you looked back to shore. Now tell me, who would want to kill somethin' like that? But that's a story for old people and that's none of us. OF US. So, uh, would either of you like to make up a story? Like maybe when the fabled Lake Monster attacked the boat? You don't really think we're gonna fall for that, do you? I know why this place is so creepy. It was meant for people... families to be together, having fun. It's not supposed to be alone. I mean, don't people wanna have fun anymore? It's like a lost toy, or a broken doll, or worse. And you know somethin' about lost toys, don't you, Kristy? The world outgrew this place. Now that's the only real and new story here. Happens every day. What about you, James? You can admit it. People still have fun. Just different kinds. Oh, come on, Kristy. You said yourself, your first memory of this place was being burned by a cigarette. My friend was crippled. I mean, the crowds, the overpriced crappy food, The money you'd spend on-on what? Hanging upside down for five minutes, gettin' off some ride... This is crazy, we're in a boat that can't float... talking to some dead clown who's givin' us... psychedelic nostalgia mumbo jumbo bullshit! Yeah, this can't be happening. I-, I don't believe it. You could kiss my ass all the way back to hell, boy. You hit the nal on the head. My head. No more tricks and stories, 'cause you're not listening. You want the here and now? Well, shouldn't the sun be up already? And as for myself and this boatd, we're not here either. Swim for shore! Great idea. Now I know why they call it cold reality. This is the rocket ride. This is probably the best ride I went on. All I'm interested in now is a last memory. Which way out? I smell hamburgers. This would be the place for it. Towards the end, this was known as the beer garden. Yeah, we never came to this part of the park. My mom said there were bad people here. It kind of attracted the wrong kind of crowd to the place. I remember asking my dad why the motorcycle girls had chains on them. If they were pets. This is a cute bear, it's too cute for words. What is it worth to you? What would you give up to have it? This bear wants some sugar from you, honey. No! You guys wouldn't understand. You and I do, don't we? This bear has a story, all right. There you go. Take your time and squeeze, don't trip the trigger close on that one. Don't make her do it if she doesn't want to. - She wants to. - Don't baby her. You're teaching her to kill things. She's not killing anything. I'll give her five more shots for half price. Stupid game. Guns are gross anyway. Getting mad about it isn't gonna help anything. Neither is trying to make a shooting game into some kind of life lesson. But the chicken's good. That boy over there won this and he said to give it you you. Secret admirers are the best kind, sweetie. So now you guys know, , this isn't just a little girl's toy. It's a young woman's first taste of love. Well, there's no love here, but would you settle for sex? You ask her that like she's got a choice? - Oh, what's that? - No, don't! Did you just see something? Does this mean something bad? Never did before. I lost that here years ago. Oh well, there were probably crates of them around here as prizes. You should take this one if it's like the one you lost. Take it, you probably deserve it for surviving this place. Yeah, probably so... What are you afraid of? Not making par? Don't worry, we'll find something you'll be afraid of... Just give 'em time. Hey, this is yours. If you as a biker didn't throw that, how did it end up in the water? Because my cold reality isn't worth a damn. Would you mind? You know, this is pretty tricky. I mean, there's a, there's... there's a big break to the left, And if you're not real careful... Uh! Oh! That's the trouble, but it's all in good fun. Okay, we get it. We can't just walk out of here. What then? I tried to tell you, you wouldn't listen. Bot, oh well... the next hole's much easier. Why don't you join me? Lookey here, lookey here, lookey here, lookey here, yeah! Your turn! Hey sure, yeah, I'll go first. Why not? Just follow my lead. So what do we do after this? There's plenty of things that need to be done around here. We just move on and do 'em. Until? Until they're done. Swingin' a little wild there, friend. I guess the sun was in his eyes. Let me give it a whack. This is not how the game is played. And if you can't play right, then you can't play at all. You need to see about your friend over there. Get away! Hey, hey, wwait! Wait! Wait! Hey, help! If you'd helped me, I'd help you now. You want outta here? Let's go for a ride. It can't go anywhere. You know that's not true. This is how you got here. If it can't go anywhere, then which anywhere did you come from? With me, what you see is what you get. But what do you really know about James? I'm not listening to you. I'm not driving with you. Oh, you've seen me drive? Well, then - you take the car. Wow. That thing stinks. You're tellin' me, you should try wearin' it. I'm sweating like a shop girl in this thing. Where'd she go? How should I know? I was too busy eating you to notice. You know, I pegged the guy that wore this stupid suit with a rock one time, bet that means I could do the same to you now. Oh, you brute. Oh well. It was just a toy to a lonely girl a long time ago. And, uh, speakin' of time... it's a wastin', don't you think? There's no tellin' what'll happen to her on her own. Did you ever stop to think that whatever is happenin'... to her alone will happen to you both together? Go jump back in the lake where you belong. We're all where we belong right now, James. I'm okay, I'm okay. It-it was just the carny in a cheesy monster suit. That's not what I saw.. The monster was real to you as a kid, so it's gonna be real now. But-but it's no danger to me. I don't know that. I- I just saw your friend Dyrk in the parking lot. One second he was in his chair, and then he had a big hole in him... and then he was the carny. And-and now you're here. Well, my guess would be the real Dyrk is the one outside the fence. But I don't see him now. I tried to hop the fence, that's when things got crazy. Well, that's better that trying to go through the fence... and getting eaten by an alligator. See, now the reason this looks like an easy escape is... Because it's a complicated trap. How's that different from being in here? Because between us, when we're together, we've been able to survive. Survive for what? To be tortured by the memories that haunt this place? If you believe anything the carny says, our fate is inside. Well, you know, the only thing I really believe of what he says is that poem, The stuff about the place bein' alone, not wantin' to be so. I was saying on the boat that this place wasn't meant to be abandoned. He seemed to like that. Alright. So let's give it one last day. You know, like the mini golf but without the Lake Monster. Uh, you know, go on all the rides we can, do all the things. What things? Bring this place back to life? Live out the stories to kill them off, so to speak. Maybe. - It's either that or the alligator for me. - And worse for me. Alright - let's go on some rides! I do kinda feel like a mouse in a trap. Wait, wait, wait! Wasn't that what it was called? Yeah, the "Wild Mouse", I think. No, no, it was the "Mad Cat". No, that doesn't make sense.. The cars were shaped like mice, they zipped through here like crazy. Yeah, right. Mad. Like a Mad Cat. I remember it like it was yesterday. - Do you remember why a cat would be mad? - Because it couldn't catch the mouse. Right, the Wild Mouse that zips through here. Okay, don't argue with me about this. I am right. What else do I have to do? We certainly can't ride this fuck, fucker rickin' thing. Ah! Can you see now why the cat was so mad? What I see is another ride. This was the world's fastest ferris wheel. My dad said he rode it once and threw up. Better than getting depressed. I never rode it. Hey, you kids, stop wastin' your time with those rides. You know, James is right. I mean, all you do is go up and down, round in circles. Best thing can happen is you throw up or get hurt. Now where's the fun in that? Anybody else here I might be talkin' to? No! So it must be you two lovies. I ask again - where's the fun in that? - Nowhere. - Beats me. That's right. You know, I'm not sayin' that rides are only for the dumb or insane... But I am sayin' they're only for the imsanely dumb. Now here are games that require nerves, physical coordination... to be rewarded instantly by prizes. Both of which always go down well with the ladies. - So... I see you have chosen! - We didn't choose it, you did. Of course, you're the best couple here. You wanna play the best game here and this is it. - >What is this about? - I have no idea. What is the matter with you? Don't you have eyes? It looks like you got eyes. But if they're not workin', maybe I can find the appropriate rusty implement... No, no, no, of course we can see. We-we just wanna hear your pitch, that's all. Part of the game, isn't it. Pitch? Pitch. What an excellent choice of words, my spectacular friend... because this is a pitching game. You have played the great American sport, haven't you? Actually, I have, and I'm pretty good at it. Oh. You're old enough now not to listen when a guy talks... about himself like that, aren't you, sweetie? I don't fall for anything you say about yourself. Well, I'm not a man. Not anymore, anyway. But thank you very much for rubbin' it in. I'm sorry I don't have salt to pour in my lonely wounds. But, oh well, I'm supposed to be your spirited ring leader. Where was I? You said this is a pitching game. So what do I get, three balls? So you've played this before. You wouldn't be tryin' to hustle me, would you? Never. I'm sure you're far too clever for me to do that. I know you don't believe that, but you're about to find out the hard way. So what. If I remember - five dollars? I hope you pitch better than you remember. It's a dollar a ball. What the hell is that, cartoon money? She's such a kidder, here, I have, uh, real money. - What do we get if he wins? - Why, any of our lovely prizes. But the real question is... what do I get when he loses? The money. The money's just a formality, what's a non-entity gonna do with money? - Those are the rules of the game. - Those are your rules. I haven't even told you the rules and you're telling me? I know, I know, this is a plate game. Three plates, I have to shatter them all, not crack them. Shatter them to win the prize. Now give me the balls. They're right here. I know what I'll take if you lose - I'll take your hand. But you've already got two of your own, why make the game so serious? 'Cause serious games are the only ones worth playin' And besides, I can always use an extra hand. You can pick your nose, scratch your back fondle your private parts.. Or those of a significant other. Sorry I asked. Okay, so do you know where the plates would be. Do you see any trace of 'em? I see it. No problem. Wow! You threw that like you meant it. Maybe even over-achieved. I'm sorry, I ddn't know there was any danger... of getting hit by things that weren't there. You okay? She's fine, no thanks to you, Tarzan. Now come on, first one's meant to be easy. Okay, they're arranged in a pyramid-type shape. Just aim about a foot to the right of the first one. And you'll be right in the center of the second one. Let's go. Whoa! Them poor little kids in China gonna be up all night... making those things, Captain America! Come on, there's plenty of time for that later if you can - and you won't - hit the last one. It's time to crack under pressure, so to squeak. Come on son, every man knows what to do with two balls, if you know what I mean. And with all due apologies, but you're on to number three now. Do you see anything? Nothing. Can you see where the second ball hit? It seems like the way the game is played has changed in your favor. Home field advantage. Why don't you call a cop? Ha-ha! You can't tell me that didn't break it. Id like to, but I can't. So which prize do you want? Ha-ha! It's yours, pick it out. Do you have a little white bear? Here you go. What? There's something alive in there. Can't you see it? Can't know what's in it until you open it. Don't have much patience, I never did. So let me open it for you. Ha! Ha! Ha! What? It's mine! Of course it is. Do with it as you will. What's the matter? Did you lose your little white bear? It's time to play my game. Certainly, ladies first. There used to be a dunking tank along here. Well, so far we've been playin' nice and friendly. - The dunking tank. - You mean this one here? I give you fair warning... You think I've been obnoxious before? The whole point of this game is for me to irk you so much... that you can't think or throw straight. Well, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Ooh, you see that, James, my boy? Is she from hell? Is that a hint? How much for real balls? She wants balls! That's too obvious for me to comment on. I don't want your money, dearie. I want your wrath. Oh, you got it. You certainly act like a woman's libber, but shouldn't you have burned your bra so you could jiggle for my delight? Show me some headlights! Ooh-hoo. You suck! Wow, you suck! Do you suck that hard in the sack or are you afraid to give a man... pleasure that way like you afraid of everything else in your life? Hey james, check out the ass on that tit wagon, hmm... It ain't much but it's all she got. Ah! Alright, now look, don't let him get to you with all this crap he's spewing. - I wanna do it. - But this could be his trick. Want some cotton candy? I chose this game because this is the game where he can get hurt, not us. Oh, Kristy's a master of not being hurt. She's a wounded animal who hides it by tryin' to bite the hand that feeds her. She thinks she's punishing the world, but all she's doing is keeping her own wounds open and fresh. Come on, you haven't called me a bitch yet. Well, I woulda called you bitch- but it'd be an insult to bitches everywhere. Yes! That is what I wanted to do this whole time. What's the matter, what... you afraid of a little pain? What makes you think you can kill me? Did you ever hear the story about the woman who was so mad playing "dump the punk"... - that she killed the punk? - Never heard it. It's a brand new one. And the best part is how she did it! Ah! I'm just living the stories and playing in the park one last time. - Those are your own rules. - Home field disadvantage, I guess. Your trouble is, you're smarter than you look. Oh well, into everybody's life a little darkness must fall. You've seen mine, now where's yours? Wow! Remind me never to piss you off. - >Ou don't have to be a drag to do this. - But it helps. This way, he'll be dead for the both of us. Couldn't hurt. What the-am I getting weak or is this thing getting heavier? Do you think that fighting and struggling will save you? Only luck, only chance, and some call it fate, can save you, damn you. Well, hopefully he stays up there until he's bone like the rest of them. We're the giants now. This is the key to his car. What do you think this key goes to? Uh-oh. I was hopin' he wouldn't be able to leave the park. - That good enough for you? - Heck yeah! - I guess you don't have to ask the question. - What question is that? Your place or mine? Ooh. What? Hey, hey, you're dreaming.. I guess I was thinking about what we did to the carny. Like the giants. Do you think you're having fun? Well, you're not until you've gone to the funhouse. Be aroused and amused, be confused and abused. But you'll laugh yourself silly in the funhouse. Hurry though, this may be your last chance! This is indeed the fun that cannot last. Get a blast out of the funhouse. No one can leave Chippewa without the frightfully fun time... that can only come when you enter the funhouse. Be warned, parents, no youngsters should brave the funhouse alone. Oh yeah, you're supposed to put your hands in there to feel something strange. - I don't need to do that to feel strange. - Well, we have to. In order to really do the funhouse, we have to do it. Yeah, I don't mean to girl out on you, but you go ahead. Alright. See, nothin' to it. They just take like a bowl of wet super balls and they're supposed to be eyeballs or somethin'. Alright, alright, I'll try this one. See, it's easy. Do you feel anything? Yeah, I don't know. Just like a piece of carpet or something. It's supposed to be rats. Yeah, it feels pretty fake, I admit. Alright, let me try. Ah, some kind of trigger thing, probably used to drop a skeleton in our faces. Pull something, and- Okay, it's obviously broken. Stop messing around with it. We need a lighter or a match. I think I have- No, there - I see it. You hear something? Run! Like hell! - It's a wall. - A mirror. A fake exit! Not for long. Oh! Thanks for catching me. I could've been killed. We both could've been. That's it, there's no way out of here? Only back the way we came. Help me! James, is that you? Help me! Some help you are, Again, you can't help yourself, how could you help me? Oh. Ah! What are you doing in my house? Ah! Run, Kristy. Run from one pain to another. But where has it gotten you? Because you can't escape from what's inside your own skin... until that skin falls away in death. And that pretty much puts us where we are, doesn't it? You're just a tiny echo of the last summer Some little girl hoped for something she never again even tried. You belong here more than any broken ride or riding built, end of story! No, no! Kristy, where'd you go? Oh! You are not real! So at least we're finally alone. Don't worry, it's not unusual to talk to yourself. And you need to stop right now and think about your situation. Oh, it's real. See, you and your girlfriend killed the carny. But to you, the carny was the monster in a monster suit. So now with the carny gone, all that's left is the monster. Kinda makes you wish the carny was back, doesn't it? Not really. - I don't talk to myself either. - If you say so. James! Are you in there? Kristy, yes! I'm here! She's nothing but trouble since she woke you from a dream. Do you even remember what you were dreaming? You can dream in a dumb dream. James? James, I'm over here! If we keep moving, we're never gonna find each other. I'm just gonna stay here, you come to me. Well, real monsters hate real fire. Ah, ah. Help, help, get me outta here! Help, help! Help, help! Get me outta here! Where are you? Help! I'll save you now. Oh, ah! I was standing still but you weren't finding me. Are you trying to burn this place down? Uh, no, no. that, that's not what I meant. Come on. I've had about all the fun I can stand in here. That's us.. But is it what we've already done or what we will do? Let's find out. Come on we can catch up to them. - Hurry up! - I'm trying. They're almost there. They- We made it! Uh, we can't leave. We can't leave the gate open either. I Died out there. I think I'm dead in here too, I saw it. I've seen myself too. There's no proof that either of us is alive. Look, we-we went into the funhouse We saw some scary, crazy things. That's the funhouse, that's what it's supposed to be. That's its story, just like all the other things we saw happen or made happen. Yeah, that's the last story there was. But we did everything the carny said. All it did was show us that we're dead, over and over again. We're trapped, just like the whole place is. There's no proof either of us is dead. Maybe there is. Do you see any bones? No. Wait- Yes. I saw myself dead in the car, so if you find bones, they're-they're mine. Someone's dog I think. Unless they named their really big cat Fido. - Whoa, whoa! - What is that thing anyway? I don't know Let's see.. Oh, it's dedicated to our beloved carny. It explains that this is his car, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, there's a picture of him here. - What is it? - You have to see this. What? I already know what he looks like. So who have we been seeing as the carny all this time? Hello? Anybody here? We're not falling for any of his tricks. Wait, wait. He looks like our guy, but he doesn't act that way. - I never rode that. - Neither did I. Could that somehow matter? The ferris wheel? The carny kept us from getting too close to it earlier. Yeah, yeah, I suppose so. But we can't ride it now. the motor's nothin' but a pile of rust and weeds. It's not fair! We did everything we could, Everything except the ferris wheel!\ You need a ferris wheel? Did you say something about a ferris wheel? 'cause I got one. Supposed to deliver it to the Chippewa Fair. But uh, saw the park sign down by the road. Yeah. I must be lost. I know what you mean. Shouldn't have pulled back this far, but I saw you. I thought you were leading me in. I just kept a-comin'. Uh, could you set this up and run it? Why sure, but this ain't the fairgrounds. What are you doing? No, I know that's further down the same road, so why would I set it up here? I don't do this for my health, you know what I mean? Uh, no, of course not. If you got the money, I got the time. You give me that, I'll throw in a suit. The suit? You're payin' me to run it, you might as well have the whole show, so to speak. Yeah, might as well. Could you set it up as close to the old ferris wheel as you can? Yeah, sure. When we were stringing up the carny in the forest, he said that only luck or fate could save us now. What else could this be? This guy looks like our carny. He took your cartoon money without blinking an eye. And he took all of it. He's real. This is real, a real ride, That last ride could be. Him coming here was an accident. But he wouldn't have come inside without us. No, this was no accident. It's not natural either. None of what we see in here could ever happen. It's real people, you mean. Yeah. We're here. Maybe we always were. We never left. What happens to us when we ride this final ride? Well, we know what happens if we don't. We've seen various versions of that the whole time we've been here. So this new carny we've been seeing is what, our own future? No, he's the present. All set up for you, miss. Now just holler when you wanna stop. Isn't that your friend Dyrk? Yeah, I guess this is one ride he can't destroy. He was never really a very good friend. He'd always make me do stuff, stuff I usually regretted later on. It's just kid stuff. It started out that way, but- Well, I guess there are things I've told you and not told since this all began... that maybe I shouldn't have. Like what? Well, that toy you lost in the park... Yeah, the one someone gave me? Secret admirers are the best kind, sweetie. That was you? Well, Dyrk made fun of me. So later that day, when we had the chance... Where have you been? Come on, let's go. Get your bear. It's your bear, Come on, let's take it. Dyrk. Hey Dyrk, you suck! That last season I started to have this intense interest in boys, I didn't know why. And when I somehow lost that doll, I just-I felt like I had failed. And give it back to her." But, you know, you know. I've still got the bear over at my house. Let's go get it. Hey, can you bring us down? James, come on. What'd you say? My friend is gone. What friend? James. We were riding together, we both talked to you. Look, lady, you're the only one that talked to me. I mean, you paid me to set this up and run it. And I threw in this sttupid clown suit for ya, But you ain't paid me enough to see people that ain't there. James? - Did you say somethin' about a James? - You know I did. Trust me, James couldn't have been on that ferris wheel. Look, James told me the things you made him do. He doesn't even talk to you anymore, so just stay out of this, okay! That's right, we don't talk because James is dead. I tried talkin' him into burning this place down, but uh, somehow - I don't know how - both our houses caught fire. I tried to save him, but what's a cripple like me do? Look, if you know what's good for you, you'll turn that thing back on... and you won't sh- turn it off until I tell you different. - Who used to live here? - James' parents. But uh, they're gone now too. They were the caretakers here? Yep, for a long time, but not really long enough to save anything. They saved enough. What really happened to you to put you in that chair? I was pushed out of a roller coaster. I know that story. What really happened? Now keep this bar down. Don't tell me what to do, you clown. Thanks for telling me the real story, but I think I prefer the one... with the evil carny. Where you get tossed out. The one you told your friend James to get him to help you... to burn this place down. Then again, tell whatever story you like. I got some of my own. I don't know where all these people are comin' from. I do.
