Audrey! Audrey! Audrey! Audrey! Audrey! Any day, Aud. What? You got a new costumer. Get your head out of the clouds, Aud. I need you on stage in five. Be ready to spread some dazzling Christmas cheer, you hear? Got it. Right. I'm sorry. Sorry. What is on her mind? Hi! Welcome to Cantante's. How are you? I'll have a cappuccino. Okay. And, do you wanna hear the specials? No, just the coffee. I thought that there was supposed to be singing happening. Yes. There is. Sorry. We're about to go on. I will put your order in and bring it out to you in a bit. -Okay? -Can't wait. -Hi, my little Christmas elf. -Hi, mommy. Hi. Do you have time to sit with us for a minute? Um, you know, maybe in a few. If it slows down I can take my break, maybe. Mommy, you're wearing the pin I made. I love it so much. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome you all to Cantante Eatery. The only place in town where we serve delicious food and Christmas music. Now, let's Christmas this place up with a duet from one of our newcomers, Colton Young and our house favorite, Audrey Turner! -Time to go. -Knock 'em dead. - Give 'em a big hand. - Wish me luck. - Yeah. - Okay. Yay! Mommy! Ooh. Yeah. Come on. Yes! -Yay! -Yay. Whoo! Whoo! Hey. Can I get you anything else? -Just the check. -You got it. No problem-o. My God! I am so sorry. -Yeah, napkins. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gotcha. I'm coming. Gosh. Listen, you are wasting your time in this place. With your voice and that face, you could actually be somebody. I am somebody. I'm a mom. I hope you have a great rest of your day. And Merry Christmas. Must be nice. So, Aud. I'm gonna need you to work a double tomorrow. Stan, it's two weeks till Christmas. I've so much to do. Come on. Leslie called out again, and I need you to take her spot. It's not so bad that she called out. She's pitchy. Why is it always me? Listen, I got plenty of ladies lined up to take your spot if you don't want this shift. Yeah? How's their pitch? Come on, Aud. Fine. I'll do it. That's the Audrey Christmas spirit I needed to hear. You're always coming through for me, Aud. And I appreciate it. All right. I'm taking my break though. Go ahead. Call Alex. You've reached Alex Samson, attorney at law. Please leave your name and number, and I'll call you back. Call Laurel. Hey, it's Laurel. Leave a message. - Hey! - Hey. Hi, mommy. Hi, baby. Hi. Hi. Must be nice. All right. So... I have to pull some doubles this week. When are we going to bake cookies? We'll find time, sweetie, I promise. All right, listen, I have to go Christmas shopping. So, I have to go tonight. - Boy. - What? No, no. The shelter needs me to write a grant tonight, so I have to work a little late. Okay. Kelly, how'd you like to go to Karen's? With their new puppy? I'm good with it. That's my girl! There we go. -You know, I love you so much. -I love you, too. -I love you more. -I love you more. -More, more, more... -More, more, more... I love you, infinity. Mommy. So here's what's gonna happen, Tyler. You are going to track down Mr. McDade. He's the one that thought it'd be a great idea for me to trot off to some greasy spoon and watch some mediocre kids sing in front of a bunch of people slurping on spaghetti. -Yes, Mrs. Samson. -God! The only good thing about the day was this waitress. God! She was a hot mess, but she could sing. I mean, really sing. Do you want me to set up a meeting with her, too? What? No, I wasn't talking to you. Yes, Mrs. Samson, I'm, I'm so sorry. And you're still sitting here because... It won't happen again. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Samson. Yeah. Hey, babe. I have to take our clients from Japan out tonight. And? And one of us has to go to the Christmas market tonight to pick up that one-of-a-kind painting of Paris that Laurel has been incessantly talking about. She has? Yes. That's fabulous. Me, a small store, and a large crowd. You have fun shopping, okay? - Love you, too. - Bye. -Welcome! -Merry Christmas. Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas. -Hello there, young lady. -Hi. I know, right? Aw. Hi. Ain't gonna happen, Audrey. Can I help you find anything, dear? Maybe some extra money. Take your time, Audrey. Hopefully, something will spark that Christmas spirit. You know, I have Christmas spirit. I do and I work really, really hard to spread it to anyone who wants some, and I just feel like... How did you know my name? The bear told me. Right. Sorry. I'm just having a really hard day. This will be perfect. You know, there's no need to apologize. It's hard to do for others when there is no gas left in the sleigh. I think I might have something to make your life sweeter. That is so thoughtful. Thank you... Mrs. Nick. Thank you, Mrs. Nick. All right. Pull it together, Audrey. -Here you go. Enjoy. -Thank you. Okay, next. I have a painting waiting for me. I'm so sorry, dear. But we've got a bit of a line behind you. If I felt like waiting in line I wouldn't have pre-ordered. I'm not moving. So, you either help me now or figure out a way to work around me. You know, this store has been in our family for many generations. We keep it because it makes people happy. Just like Christmas does. You know, if this makes you happy, then I have your painting. We keep it right here, Mrs. Samson. How did you know my name? Not many people pre-order from us. When they come, they like to take their time, slow down, and appreciate everything that's around them. - Ma'am? - Right. Be right with you. Wait, wait, wait. Here. Have this little candy-cane. It's amazing what one little candy-cane can do for you. - Next. How nice. - Hi - Merry Christmas. - Paul. -Bye. -Everything is so expensive. The cheap stuff is just so cheap. Ho, ho, ho. Alex. Yeah, I got it. I know she's not gonna appreciate it. I mean, what have I taught her? Do you know that she lets me go to voicemail? How is she supposed to believe in the magic of Christmas if she can't dive into a tree full of Christmas presents? I just, I want her to feel like she deserves it, you know? Yeah, I know that we can afford it. I, I just want her to have a normal Christmas, you know? I, I want her to want to answer when I call. I want her to see her mom as successful. She's my daughter and she barely speaks to me, Alex. Sometimes, I wish we could just have a do-over. I want her to see her mom shine. Something that makes us sparkle. -I wish things were different. -I wish things were different. Hey! I know you. You're that singing waitress. You're that lady from the restaurant. What? What? Don't be alarmed. I'm up before you. Well, good morning. How are you feeling? What do you want? To check on you. You hit your head pretty hard last night. You, you, you stay away from me! Okay. So, babe, listen. Last night you were so tired and, well, you were acting weird that I called the office and I told them that you weren't coming in today. They thought I was joking. You better leave. Okay, but listen, I can stay home if you want. Maybe you hit your head harder than you thought? Okay, well, this is fun. But just a reminder that I am out of town tonight for a big deposition. So, I will see you tomorrow. Call me if you want me to cancel. Love you. "Love you?" - 911. - Help! Yes, help! I've been kidnapped. I don't know where I am. Ma'am, is there anyone there?-Yeah, there's one man. He was... Actually, he was really nice. I don't know. Are kidnappers supposed to be nice? - I don't even... - Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am, are you all right? What? What? Yeah. I'm, I'm gonna have to call you back. You? What? Hello? Whoever you are, you better come out now. I know crazy self-defense! Hey, honey. Did you call me? How did you get me here? I picked you up at the mall. Of course. You found me, you... weirdo! Hey, easy, honey. You took a pretty hard fall. When we got home, I wanted you to see the doctor, but... You, stop talking! Okay. Honey. -Maybe you should lay back down. -Will you stop calling me that? I don't know what kind of criminal you are, but I can assure you, you have messed with the wrong woman! Jeez! I really need to read up on head injuries. Not one more step. Okay. I told Stan that you weren't gonna make it into work. He wasn't happy, but what's new, right? Here's what's gonna happen. You are gonna turn around and leave. Yeah, I have to get Kelly to school. You sure you're okay? You never yell. -You should get some rest. -Get out! Okay. Pants. My pants. Pants. Perfect. No. My God! This can't be. You? You've gotta be kidding me. Come on. -Who are you here to see, ma'am? -It's me. Open the gate. What resident are you here to see? I'm Julia Samson. I don't have anybody on the Samsons' list for today. No, I'm Julia Samson. Yeah. Okay. Um, you know what you can do is you can pull right up there do a U-turn and, and just head right out. Okay, listen, I know I don't look like myself right now but I swear... Brian, just open the gate! Look, lady, okay? I don't wanna call the police. I don't. You don't want me to call the police. So you have exactly zero minutes to head straight up there, do a U-turn, get outta here. First of all, zero minutes is not a thing. Second of all, if you don't let me in right now, you are going to lose this job. I gotta tell you you do sound like her, you do. But you're not her. So, straight up, U-turn. You are gonna regret this. Have a great day. Paul said you hit your head and weren't gonna be here. You gotta be careful, Aud, okay? Put on your uniform and take section one. You think I'm her. -What? -What? Listen, you're gonna sing in ten. People have been asking for you. Okay, yeah, I can't sing or work and I'm sick. I have laryngitis. I thought you hit your head. Yeah. That's what I meant. See? Head injury. Listen, I'm looking for my friend. She is very, very beautiful, and tall, and elegant, and stylish... Aud, I don't know what's up with you. But you got to get it together. And, I think your friend just walked in. I don't believe it. I don't understand. No. No, no, no, no, no. How? This can't be real. I... How can this be real? It can't be. It can't. If this is real, I look very tired. Tell me about it. Never used to look that tired. What are you doing? I am so beautiful. It's amazing. Seriously? This doesn't just happen to people. I know, obviously. But it's happening to us. Maybe we're dreaming. Well, that's not it. What's the last thing you remember? Okay, I was shopping and I was on the phone with my husband. Me too. I was at that Christmas store. And I came upon a tree... It was you. You wouldn't let go of that ornament. What? You wouldn't let go. I remember. It broke. And it must have fallen. And then nothing, until this morning. -Exactly. -Okay. We have to go back right now to the Christmas store. Okay. Words I never thought I'd say. Let's leave before Stan sees me. I mean, you. Too late. I already told him I'm not working tonight. Words I've never said. All right, come on, let's go. You're killin' me, Aud. You're killin' me. Just a quick reminder that when we close on Christmas Eve we won't be back until next year. I hope you get everything you want before then. Yeah, you and me both, Claus. Ho-ho-ho. I'm sorry. You know, you could be nicer. -"You know, you could be nicer." -What are you doing? Just seeing if your words feel as ridiculous as they sound. It's not here. How can there be this many ornaments and no candy-cane? What? What's... What are we gonna do now? Well, w-we get hotel rooms and wait it out. Research it, fix it. And disappear at Christmas? No way. My family will be so worried. I mean, wouldn't yours? Well, if you won't let us disappear for a while, there's only one thing to do. What? We have to be each other. What? I... I have to pretend to be you? I mean, for how long? Christmas is less than two weeks away. Just until I come up with something. Unless you have a better idea. Or any idea at all. Right. Okay, there's a lot to go over. I run a record label. There's a rumor going around that we're gonna be taken over by a music streaming company. You ever heard of Gavin Vaughn? The singer? Of course. That's my client. I need to keep him. And his contract's up soon. Gavin Vaughn? Okay, I'm gonna route my work notifications, so I can see anything important because we are going to have to switch phones. There's a weekly department meeting you have to run, too. Run? Listen, the most important thing is that Gavin stays with our label. That is all you have to do. Okay? This could not be happening at a worse time. Tell me about it. I mean, we're very short on money. I'm trying to pick up as many shifts as possible. And there's a lot of activities at the school that I committed to. And my daughter, Kelly... My sweet baby angel. She's having a hard time reading lately, so I'm really trying to... And Karen. She's the sitter. I have to... Please. Kids love me. Your life is gonna be a cakewalk. I'll just pad your account. No! You, you can't pad my account. How would you explain that to Paul? I guess you're right. I should tell you, I have a 16-year-old daughter, Laurel. That's great. I-I just, I didn't, you know, see you as the motherly type. If you know what I mean? Yes, we're very close. Well, we used to be. What are we gonna do about sleeping arrangements? For me, that's easy. When I work late, Alex sleeps in the guest room. That can't be too often, can it? It'll be fine for quite a while. What about you? We sleep in the same bed. But not when my back is out. When my back is out, I sleep on the couch 'cause it's better for it. So maybe, my back, I mean, your back, it hurts because you hit your head. The couch? Great. This just keeps getting better and better. It's like fertilizer. Not my body, so, technically, these calories don't count. -Hello? -Hi, it's Tyler. -Who? Tyler? -Tyler, you're... - My assistant. - There's an important meeting. -That you need to be at... -A meeting? Do I have to? You're the one who have it on schedule, so... -Okay. Yeah, I'll see you soon. -Okay... "Bake." Bake? -Heard that artist... -Hi. -Good morning. -Hi. How is it going? Ooh! Wow. That's fun. Wow. "President." Good morning, Mrs. Sampson. I am so, so sorry about that. Is everything okay, Mrs. Sampson? Yeah, just call me Audrey. -What? -What? Julia. Julia, call me Julia. I just came to get you for the morning meeting. -Tyler? -Yes? Tyler. Okay. So... Here are the expense reports for you to approve. The expense reports? Of course. And the meeting... Um... why don't you give me a rundown of the minutes on the last meeting? The minutes? Um... What do you mean? Just, you know, catch me up on the last meeting. Right. You decided to take established artists from other labels and make them your own. Well, how would new people get noticed? Well, they don't. I suggested that we hire three new artists per quarter, but that was shot down. By who? By you. All the people with hopes and dreams are just... Will never get a shot? Right. They're probably waiting for you. Yes. I'm so nervous. You're nervous? Yeah. You probably heard. I hit my head last night, so I'm gonna need you to come with me. -What? No. No, I can't... -Yes. Yeah. It'll be fun. No. I don't come into the meeting with you. Yes. You know so much. What's happening? Come on. Sit down. Sit down. What's happening? I think you're supposed to start. Hi. Um... So, we are here to talk about, um... new talent. Can we just agree to go after Shooting Star Records? We have to avoid this merger and draft Gavin Vaughn's contract. I mean, he's gonna try to get everything out of us that he can. Wait. Excuse me. Hi. It's just that, Tyler here, um, he has some really good ideas, so, um, I'm gonna let him tell you about a new... -Strategy? -Strategy. Yeah. See? He's so smart. This is lovely. I am so glad you're here. You will not believe who copped out on the bake sale. Helen, of course. So, please, just make sure everyone's in their place today and then collect the money from them at the end. -What are those? -Cookies. Those aren't your cookies. Well, I bought them, so they're mine. And I'm giving them to you, so they're yours. Are you feeling okay? I hit my head. Listen, I have a job. I seem to do everything at home and I'm involved in all these activities? When was the last time I said no? You never say no. -Driven herself into the ground. -She who? Okay, here's what we're gonna do, these cookies are all I'm doing for this bake sale. Anything else, you'll have to delegate as well. Okaysies? Okay. I guess I can do that. Great. Keep up the good work. Audrey. Audrey! Yes? Don't forget Kelly. Kelly. Right. Of course. Kelly. Audrey. Just... getting a running start. Okay, I need a Kelly. Mommy! Kelly. Hi. What's that? We had to draw a picture for what we're thankful for, and I drew you. That's... That's really thoughtful. Thank you. Where to now? Mommy, you're funny. Let's go home. Yes. Home. Perfect. -It's popcorn night! -What's popcorn night? It's when you make popcorn and brownies and grill cheese, and put it all around the tree. It's popcorn night! Sounds like we're gonna be busy. What's that other piece of paper? It's my reading homework. I got a silver star. A silver. Well, don't worry. I'm sure next time you'll get a gold. Come. March. Hup, two. Let's go! Hi. You okay down there? Hi. Yeah. Say, "Cheese." Nice one, mom. That should be our Christmas card. Wait, we don't do those. Laurel. How was school? Good. Why are you home? It's really late. Not for you, it isn't. Well, I thought that we could decorate the house for Christmas. I mean, it really needs it. What do you think? Sorry, I just, I have so much school work to do. I can't just drop everything and have a Christmas revival. Well, I, um... Well, I can make us dinner. Mom, seriously? It's sushi night. Once it gets here, I'm just gonna go upstairs and eat it in my room. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. I-I'm fine. I'm just tired. I'll be in my room working on my history project. I'm not gonna give up on that Christmas decorating idea, though. Fun. Jeez. Teenagers are tough. Kelly! Popcorn night! Yay! Come on, sleepyhead. Juice. Juice, juice, juice. Okay. Hey, how is my sleepyhead? Is your back out? What? Yeah. I'll probably be on the couch for a while. Hey, good morning. Good morning. Ooh. There it is. Hey, mommy, is this my sandwich? Yes, it is. Mommy, I don't want crust. No note. There's no note in there. Nobody said anything about a note. Kelly, you're gonna have to take the crust off yourself, okay? Here you go, sweetie. I'll meet you at the front door, okay? Okay. You usually put a little Christmas note in her lunch bag. -She really looks forward to it. -Couldn't you have done it? Well, I guess it never crossed my mind. Yeah, well, can't think of everything. Okay. -I'll see you tonight. -See ya. Hello. Hey, how's it going? It's been busy. Um, meetings, expense reports, contracts. Listen, I need you to remind Tyler that someone in legal has to go over the Gavin Vaughn contract, okay? This is the most important thing to me right now. Yeah, contract to legal. Okay. Hey, how's Kelly? She's good. I guess I missed some sort of note in her lunch bag. No. The note. I totally forgot to tell you. She must've been so disappointed. My poor little girl. She'll be fine. Okay, I gotta go put on that uniform and get to work. Try not to mess anything up. Wait. Julia, don't you wanna hear about Laurel? I'm not worried about her. She's a teenager, she's practically an adult. That's when daughters need their moms the most, you know? Well, it's a good thing I raised her to be independent then, isn't it? Now, I gotta go to work or you are gonna be late. - Watch it. - Relax. Trust me. That fabric isn't holding on to anything. Just hose it off when you get home. Aud, you're getting complaints. People are getting the wrong food or no food at all. Yeah, I have never seen a needier group of people in my life. Well, can you at least get on stage? My head, it's just... I can't. My God! How was your day? Great. Thanks, yours? Really? Wow. I like that glitter. Why don't you keep... Put a thing in that green icing... I think maybe I'll... I'm going to... It's spilling on to... It's spilling? Okay. Let's put it on a cookie then. Yeah, use your fingers. Why not? That's a bold choice. Look how good are you at this. I mean, you could be a professional. I wish I was good reading stories like I am at cookies. Well, I bet you're a better reader than you think you are. I can help you with that, you know? - You can? . Sure. I'll just make a schedule to fit in reading every day. Okay. Because you know, all your success in life begins with being a good communicator, and that begins with reading. It's very important you do the work. What is it, honey? Right back at ya. Good. - Take that. - Yeah. And just put it... There you go. Yes. Whoa! What happened in here? Mom is bringing Christmas back. Yeah. Wow, I, I haven't seen some of this stuff in forever. Yeah, it's just, you know, Christmas is really important and decorating is such a fun part of it. It's too fun to miss. Well, your grandma would be so proud of you. Okay. So what are we doing here? We are threading popcorn for garland. Her head injury really spiced things up around here. That reminds me, we need to get a tree. Wait, really? All right! We'll get a tree. -Yay. -Yes. Kelly, time to hit the road. Coming, daddy. Ooh! Tie's crooked. -How's work? -Which one, here or at home? How are Laurel and Alex? When they're home, they're good. We decorated the house. You decorated the house using my grandmother's stuff? I'm sorry. Is that not okay? Well, I just haven't seen that stuff since she died ten years ago. She raised me and she always made such a big deal about Christmas. Did Laurel like it? She really seemed to. Actually, it tore her away from her homework. Alex said he was really proud of you. Proud of you. Not me. You. How's Kelly and Paul? I've never been away from them for this long. Do you think you can send me a picture? I just miss their faces. Yeah, sure. Kelly is really sweet. She does lack structure. So, I'm having her help out with things around the house, and we are concentrating more on school work. She's four. She's, she's not supposed to have structure. Not like the minute-to-minute work schedule that Laurel's created for herself. I mean, why does everybody in your house have to work all the time? Whoa! I love my job, okay? And you work all the time, too, just not doing anything you love. You need to say "No" more. Wow, it seems like you really figured out my life for me. Listen... I'm trying to figure how to get us out of this mess, okay? There's nothing online. It's not a medical condition. Look at this. It says that the store closes on Christmas Eve, and it doesn't reopen for a year from now. What if we don't change back before Christmas? Ladies and gentlemen, it's been too long since Audrey has hit the stage, so... No, no, no. What is he doing? I... Get her up here. What do I do? Just sing. You have the voice, right? I think. - What song am I even gonna do? - Joy To The World. -Joy To The... -Everybody knows that one. Yay! Audrey! You're gonna get it. Stan. Please. It's like riding a bike, kiddo. I don't ride bikes. Hit it. Aud, you gotta get that head checked out. People are counting on you. That wasn't good? Wasn't good? It wasn't you. Finish your break. Get some water or... some wine. A glass of wine. Or two. Head injuries. What are you gonna do? That was terrifying. Why can't I sing like you? I think it's like an instrument. You know, you have it, but you don't know how to use it. I taught myself how to sing. I even used to write my own music when I had the time. I can't believe you do that every day. I feel really calm on the stage. I wish I'd pursued it. Why didn't you? Life happened. Listen, I'm sorry about before. I am too. I think that we were just both stressed out. Well, you know what calms me? Spa day. Let me set up a few appointments for you and you can get a taste of my "Me" time. Besides, I can't let my body get overrun with stress. It ages you. Well, by all means, let's keep you young. That's for the both of us. Besides, maybe something will come to you while you relax. One of us needs to. And it ain't gonna be me. Okay. Hi. Yeah. So, I get this regularly? Are you kidding me? Hey. Come on in. They look so nice. So shiny. It's just what I needed. I'm excited. How's yours going? So good. Do you like the color? - I do. Look. - I love yours. - Thank you. - It's so Christmassy. - Hey, Tyler. - Hey, Julia. So, you've got a shareholders' meeting at 3:00. A conference call at 5:00 and a talent dinner at 8:00. -No. -What? But... No. No, and no. -But it's just that you've... -I know. But listen, Tyler, there's more to life than work. And... it's the Christmas season for crying out loud. I'm gonna go. Just, you know, cancel 'em. Okay? It's just that you have a lot to do. "Hey, Gavin, Julia had to cancel 'cause she had to go Christmas shopping with her husband. Yes, someone did marry her." What's with you? What... What'd you just say a minute ago? What'd you wanna say to me? Come on, come on. Answer, answer. Hello. You've reached Julia Sampson. Leave me a message, and I will get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you. Um, okay. - ... Um... ... okay, here we, okay. Um, I can use this and then, I-I need that. -Okay, she needs two pillows. -Yes, yes. Thank you. Hang on. Um, okay. Wait, wait, okay. -Ready? Here we go. -Um... Okay, you're, you're-you're Santa Clause. - You have your, your gifts. - She's taking a nap. -You're tired, right? -I just... There's, there's pillows, you're sleepy. It's been, Now, you're, Statue Of Liberty. Are you sure this is a Christmas movie? I mean, is it from this century? No. Okay. It's okay. Um... Let's just... Come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hello, you've reached Julia Sampson. Leave me a message... Audrey, pick up! Good evening, miss. How can I help you? I need to see a Julia Sampson, please. Let's take a look here. What's your name? -Audrey Turner. -Turner. I don't see your name here. Could you just do me this one favor, please? Please, it's an emergency. I can check it twice. Turner. Yes. Yes, here you are. Really? Thank you so much. It really helps when someone is being nice. You know, you look really familiar. I get that a lot, dear. Have a nice night... Julia. Goodnight. Thanks. Wait. What? F-four words. -Okay, it's a movie. Yup. -A film. Yeah. Sounds like. You, me... - R-ring. - She's your wife. - Okay -Wife. Sounds like wife. -Fourth word sounds... -Um... -It's A Wonderful Life.Bam! -Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Yeah! There we go! Bam! Nice! You've seen that, right? -No, I don't think so. -What? Hey, mom, thanks so much for doing this. This has been the best Christmas ever. So sweet. Excuse me. Someone is performing up here. Sorry, dad. Um, okay. Um... -One word. -Okay. -Movie. -Movie. Okay. -Jaws. -Jaws. That was good. You do that every time. Jeez. Tyler will not stop calling me. -What's he want? -I don't know. Something about a new meeting. But I already told him no. U-... W-who goes there? Julia? - Mom? - I mean, Audrey? What was that voice, dad? I don't know. What are you doing here? I've been calling and texting you all night. I'm sorry, we have a strict no phone policy at night. -You do? -Yeah. Okay. You have to go to the office. The Gavin Vaughn meeting has been moved to tonight. What? That wasn't supposed to happen for another few days. I know. Famous singers tend to change their minds. Here, I got us this. This is a earpiece, I can listen to you and talk to you. I will get you through the meeting. But it's just... It's so late and I promised Laurel that we would play. Sorry, hang. S-she asked you to hang? -Yeah. -She... Really? Okay. Look, I know there are lot of work things I can delegate. I-I, I understand, but this is not one of them, okay? I need you to do this for me, please. Okay, yes, of course, of course. Okay, come on. -No, we have to go. -Come in, it's your family. We have to go. Hey, guys. Um, this is my friend Audrey. Audrey, this is... Laurel and Alex. Wow. I've missed you. Um... Missed you the last time that she came to see me. So finally, you guys get to meet. -Yeah. -Yes. Right. Right. Hi. Laurel, it turns out that I actually do have to go to the office tonight. Of course you do. -Laurel. -What? She said she's gonna stay home and it lasted like ten minutes. Just like the old mom. I'll go. Don't worry, they're gonna be fine. They're gonna be fine. Listen to me, Julia. You work so hard, and your family loves you so much, they just wanna spend more time with you. And they will, okay? But right now, all of that hard work will have been for nothing if we don't save your business. You're right. You're right, okay. Okay, I'll talk you through it. We can do this. -We can do this. -We can do this. Yeah. Let me grab my jacket. Yeah, and then we got to go. Yep. We can do this. Okay, can you hear me? I can hear you. Okay. Gavin's entering the building. Keep it cool, you cannot be star-struck. Hey, Gavin Vaughn. Just Gavin. When do you ever say hello using a first and last name? Gavin, hello. Hey, Julia. Look, I-I'm kind of in a hurry, so can we, you know, knock this out? Absolutely, it should run smoothly. Yeah, so we're... And it's all gonna be fine. A-are you okay? Yes, yep. You? Calm down. Get the contract out of the top drawer, tell him you think it'll be beneficial for both you and him. Here it is. It's... So we think it's really good, and it's gonna be beneficial for everybody. Okay, let's get to the good stuff. He's going to the money page. Remember, we cannot go more than three million above the offer, okay? Not one penny, not one cent... Whoo! We're about to sign a contract tonight. Tonight. Wait, I can't... Audrey? Wait, you're braking up. Audrey? Yeah, so, the money isn't right. Well... Audrey, Audrey, come in, Audrey... Come on! All right, I'll be there in five minutes. You know, i-if we don't come up by four, then, we don't have a deal. Four? Julia, I-I know you're a shark, but come on. Okay, you know what? This is, this is a waste of time. I mean, Stargaze will give me four over this and they're willing to sign tonight. So... Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Okay. Money is important. Of course, it is. But think about this, you are one of the biggest stars on the planet. And I have believed in you every step of the way. People are ready for whatever you're gonna do next. And they're gonna eat it up. Simply because it's you. Yeah, I've done all right. Go on. You represent everyone with a dream. Look at what you've accomplished. I can give you three million and I'm asking that you value our relationship for the one million that I can't. All right, w-we have a deal. You know, I-I d-didn't know that you cared so much, Julia. Send this contract to my agents... And, um, thank you. Heh! Merry Christmas, Gavin. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Psst! I can't believe it! You did it, I can't believe you did it! Thank you. Listen, I've been thinking, let's get our families together tomorrow, okay? Maybe having everyone together will spark something to switch us back. Yeah, I'm willing to do anything. Christmas Eve is the day after tomorrow and... we have to fix this. In the meantime, thanks for saving my company. It was nothing. Hi! Wow! Sweet Kelly. You guys look great. Hi, Julia. Hi. Come on in. Let's go. Wow! Hey, guys. This is my husband Alex and daughter Laurel. -This is Kelly and Paul. -Hi. Hi. This is for you. Thanks, man. Wine all the way around? Yeah. No thanks. -That's cute. -Shall we? So... Laurel, why don't you show Kelly some of the games that we got out for her? Sure. They're your favorites. - Thank you! - I love your hair. Come. Ooh! I mean... Let me show you something. This tree is so beautiful. I remember this. I love this. Thank you. -Thanks for coming over, guys. -Thank you. You know, it's really good to have people over for Christmas again. -Cheers. -Cheers to that. Cheers. Alex! Anyone want a cookie? Um, I'm okay. -Paul, take a cookie. -Cool. Thank you. Yeah. They're really good. No phones please, Laurel. No, I know. It'll just be a second. It's about school. Hey! Um, did you finish the project? Wh-what? -Yeah, okay. -Will you excuse me? Yeah. Well, now what? No, we're not gonna get an A. I can't believe you. What... No, I'm not being dramatic! Okay. Thanks a lot, Nelly. Hey, Laurel. Sorry. I couldn't help but overhear. What happened? My friend just totally spaced on her part of the project that I have to turn in when school starts again and she's leaving, like now, for a vacation. Couldn't you just turn in your part? You think that's okay? No, my mom is gonna be so disappointed. I mean, if my grades aren't good enough for valedictorian, then what? I'm never gonna be good enough. I'll just be a failure. A failure? She would never think that. No matter what, she could never be disappointed. She is so proud of you. Yeah, okay. No, listen. It's true. Okay? She doesn't want you to be perfect, she wants you to be happy. There's no such thing as perfect. She knows that now and she wants you to know it too. How do you know this? She... told me. She said that you and your dad are what matter most to her. She loves you more than anything in this world, do you understand? Just give her a chance to show you that. And give yourself a break. You must be a really good mom. I feel a lot better. And she'll hug you more, too. I just know she will. Okay. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Audrey. You bet. Can I build one right here? Let's do one this way, too. -Okay. -How's school going? -Great. -Yeah? I'm getting gold stars now. Wow! You're so smart! I can read all by myself. Aw! Really? How did you manage all that? My mom helped me prioritize my time. What does that mean? She gave me a chore chart and we read a story at bed time. Chore chart? -Do you like to help your mom? -I love helping my mom. She gets to do stuff that she really likes. Plus, mommy is happy too. Julia decorated the house for the first time in years. - Something's up and I love it. - Same here. Now finally we have some order in the house. So, Audrey has some time to herself. And in typical fashion I do realize I was part of the problem. Yeah, that happens to me all the time. I'm gonna see you in the other room. Okay. Keep building. What's wrong? I'm worried about what happens when, if, I go back to my life! Wait, what? What? I just think that Kelly and Paul are better off now! Come on. You are the best you there is. They love and need you. You, not me. Really? Yes, really. Of course, really. Thank you. You're really good at making people feel better. I don't remember the last time I heard that. Pretty sure Laurel just told you that. We're running out of time. Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. I know. Look, I have an idea, but it's not great. Any idea is a good idea at this point. What if we wish really, really hard to change back? You're right. Not great. But worth a shot. Okay. All right. One. One. -Two. -Three. I just connected with Laurel. I have to come back. And we will. But until then chin up, okay? You are the strongest person I have ever met. We've got this. I know, we just... I think that we should go back to the Christmas store after work. I think what we're looking for is there. I think you're right. Okay. It's a good idea. I'm impressed with you, Audrey. Pick me up around 5:00. I'll be there. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, the Christmas market will be closing in ten minutes. Please make your way to the exits, and have a very Merry Christmas. This is the tree. It's not here. Now what? I don't know. God, I'm so sorry that I was ever not grateful for my life. Me, too. Do we just t-tell our families the truth? "Merry Christmas! I'm trapped in someone's body! Who's ready for presents?" I mean... No, I... I am so grateful for my family. I am so grateful for my life. I'm grateful for you too, Audrey. Me, too. The Christmas market is now closed until next year. Have a very Merry Christmas. -What's happening? -I don't know. What's, what's going on? - Are you seeing these lights? - Yes! Julia, look. -Are you seeing this? -Yes. We need to make a wish. Together. Let's try this again. I wish for my beautiful, messy life back. I wish for my perfectly imperfect life back. We wish... We wish for our lives back! What? Okay. All right, I'm up. What's... -Paul... -What? Paul! My sweet Paul, I have missed you. I have missed you so much. -You-you missed me? -I did. When did you miss me? - Mommy! - I... Kelly, my little princess, come here. That's it. Kelly, come here. My baby. You're so silly, momma. I know, but I just, I just... I love you so much. So much. I love you, too, but guess what? -What? -Santa came last night! He sure did. And he brought the best Christmas ever. Like, ever. Let's go see. Let's go. -Okay, okay. -Hurry, go. We'll see you at the tree. Hey, I'm happy you're excited. I got worried about you for a minute. You weren't acting like yourself. I wasn't myself. You ready for today? Honey, I couldn't be more ready for Christmas. I love you, Paul. I love our life. I love you, too. All right. You coming? I-I can hear Kelly losing her mind right now. I'll just... Give me one sec. Hey, you want me to hang this? No! T-that one's for me. Okay. Merry Christmas, Julia. Whoo! My... Please, please, please. Please, please, please... Yes! Thank you! Thank you. Aww! Aww! Yes. What's goin' on? Alex, my husband! My husband. My thoughtful, smart, hunky husband. Well, Merry Christmas to me. Can we not ruin Christmas before it begins? Come here. I am so lucky I get to be your mom. Did you hit your head again? I did. I actually did. -What? -It's nothing. I love you, so, so, so, so much. I love you, too, mom. Hey, let's go make your mom some breakfast. - And then we'll open presents. - Breakfast. Well, I wanted to give you some time to pack. Because I am taking you, my hardworking woman, on a much needed little getaway with me, to Sedona. Alex, just like our honeymoon. All right, I'll see you kids downstairs. You know, I can't remember the last time I saw you this excited. I can't remember the last time I was this happy. I love you. I don't say that enough. I love you, too. Mwah! Breakfast. Well, I can pack later. Just give me a few minutes. What is this? No! Sorry, I just, I wanna leave this one up here with me. Okay. I'll see you downstairs. Merry Christmas, Audrey. I love you. Mommy! You're a superstar! Thank you. Hey. Honey, that was fantastic. Looks like we've got a celebrity in the house. -You made it! -Of course I made it. I had to watch from the audience. I'm so happy. Hi, guys! -Hey. -Congratulations, Audrey. -You're amazing. -Thank you so much. You look beautiful. Your A and R rep, Tyler just emailed. Your album is officially our label's number one selling Christmas record. -Are you serious? -I am serious. - Yes, yes. - That's, that's so crazy! Congratulations. My gosh, Julia. Thank you so much for everything. This is amazing. This is only the beginning. So, is everybody ready for Christmas Eve at our house? Yeah. We have a lot to celebrate this year. Yeah, Christmas! Come on. Julia! -What? -I don't even know what to say. Just thank you for everything. This is amazing. We did this together. - We did. - We did. Sounds like an occasion worthy of a toast. Definitely. Thank you. Was that... No. No way, right? Okay, what're we toasting to? To family. And to friendship. And a lifetime full of wishes. Cheers. Your mom is such a good singer, Kelly. I wish my mom could sing like that. It must be so cool to watch her on stage. Yeah, that's pretty great. But I wish we could have a record company like you, that'll be so cool. What's that?
