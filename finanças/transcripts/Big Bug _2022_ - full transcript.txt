NETFLIX PRESENTS Good boy, Jean-Claude. We're going home now. A female, Comrade Yonyx? Yes, it's a female. That's the problem. Can't take your eyes off them. - I'm not laughing. - Me neither. Turn it off, Leo. Why? Not retroglam enough for you? Back to the Upper Paleolithic. Look it up. It'll make you droolese. We're guests here, okay? Mind your language and turn that off. Those shows just humiliate humans. It's the actors I feel sorry for. No, they're not real actors. - Oh. - No. They're contestants. - Oh. - And nobody forces them. Oh, thank goodness. - I'd hate to be them. - Live. No special effects. They must get a risk bonus. They should get a humiliation bonus. - Oh, how about some grilled cricket? - I'd love one. - Cricket? - Yes. - Tasty? - Mmm. - Mmm, delicious. - Yeah. You ever thought about becoming an actress? Hey, you have the physique and such presence, such, uh, magnetism. Thank you. I'm way too shy. Uh, I'd have liked that but not on one of those TV shows. - Mmm. - No, thank you. - No, they're the worst. - Programs dreamed up by Yonyx. I told you that. So, you'll, uh, show me your latest work? Yes. You were supposed to stay home. Not a word out of you. Oh, it's rare to see a bookcase full of old books. Yeah. They're from my grandmother. Come. This is my emotion journal. Nobody is allowed to read it. I'll give you a peek. - You see? - Yes. - How wonderful. - Listen to this. "We vibrant beings need to believe in order to make others believe." Beautiful, right? It's Sarah Bernhardt. Not as beautiful as your feelings. Know why? - Because they're authentic. - Oh. Look. - You do that with a real fountain pen? - Yes. - With ink? - Yes, with ink. What matters is the craft and consistency. It requires discipline. Nobody can write anymore. Oh, it's... it's magical, Alice. You know, I, uh... I run multiple art sites. - Yes? - Yes. Why not post it on Crystal Fusion? Crystal Fusion? Oh that's my favorite. That's my favorite site. It would be a dream! "What better redemption than the recognition of one's talent?" I am so... so happy to have met you. You're not really how I imagined you. Nestor? Nestor? Spray for us Freshly Mown Lawn by Plenitude. Right away, Alice. Mmm. "What matter the scent of trees and flowers, of fire and stone if I am without home and without love?" - So beautiful. - Mmm. It's us. It's us! Nestor, door open. Sorry, it's my ex-husband. - Arriving unannounced. - Did you get my message? - Hello to you too. - Sorry, my mistake. We leave tonight, so I decided to bring sweet pea back a little earlier. Fourteen hours early is the day before. Hello, Nina. If you need any tutoring, then I will be here for you. Monique, I'm 17. I'll be fine. Nina! Nina, over here. Meet Max. Max, Nina. Oh, we adopted her when rising seas flooded the Netherlands. My darling was six months old. - Nice to meet you. - You too. Victor, my ex-husband. And his... secretary. I'm Jennifer. I'm an executive now, not a secretary, but anyway, who cares? Of course. Oh, you jumped... ...jumped up in rank. - Yeah, I did. - Mm-hmm. Victor, there's tea, grilled crickets, and boiled eggs. I'll do the offering Monique, okay? Thank you, Monique. I'm the lady of the house. So we have tea, grilled crickets, and boiled eggs. Obviously, you didn't reboot her since our divorce, so she thinks that I just got home. Okay, but you took the, um, reboot codes with you. Remember? Can you two make a little effort? Try to be human for once. Electronic perimeter breached. - Nestor, drone surveillance. - Activated, Alice. Oh, It's just Toby! Relax. It's just the neighbor's dog. Ah. Ew. And there you go. That's the last we're gonna see of it for 24 hours. Huh. And who is "we"? - Ah, "we" is you. - Ha. We're gonna be long gone by then, right, babycakes? - Far away. - Open the door, Nestor. - Ugh, slobberoos germs! - Toby 6! Out of there. Get out! Oh no! Not in my greenhouse! Not my greenhouse! Is he Toby 6 or Toby 7? Oh gosh, am I losing count? Two got run over, one drowned, one swallowed weed killer. It's all a bit... The same breed every time? Oh, worse than that. Much worse. Nestor! Bring up Toby. They cloned Toby 1. Now, if he has an accident or gets old, he's replaced by a clone. - Too bad it doesn't work with teens. - That's so funny. Fortunately, it's illegal. Well, in France, we're giga-behindawaxx. - Lucky for you. - Toby. Toby, come here. Yeah, who's the best boy? - Tom, it's Toby! - Coming, Nina. No way! You kept your first baby robot? You keep your e-binky too? I will help you clean your room. - Toby, stop it! - I will help you clean your room. I will help you clean your... your... your... your... your... your room. Ugh, pukawaxx! Vomit's flying everywhere. What's going on? What's wrong with it? It's gone totally haywire. What's it doing? What's it doing? Beat it! Psh! Psh! - Oh! Oh! - I'm allergic. I'm allergic! Well-done. Bravo, Max. A Phantom XP5. 24K camera, 800 bitdols on Altiplano, and now it's destroyed. - XP5? - That's right. - All right. I'm so sorry. - No. Don't worry about it. The subscription is in my name. Wow! A Howard V2 cleaner. Mega-collectorawaxx. Objective in sight. Impregnation. Suction. Disinfection. Thank you for your attention. - Neighbor... - Françoise. I am duty bound to list items borrowed by... Françoise. ...and never returned. One wooden spatula, three reminders. One bottle of detergent, four reminders. Come on, Nestor! Open up. It's Françoise. Anyone seen my Toby? Do you have reception in here? How are you, Françoise? Your garden needs a splash of color. It's not Chernobyl. I'm inclined to agree. I ordered cactuses. Real ones. Monique made jam out of them. We were sick for a week. Neighbor Françoise, there's tea, grilled crickets, and boiled eggs. - Well, no, thank you. - Thank you. Oh, what a surprise! Well, look at you. A suit to go with your gentlemanly attitude. Like your father's, just not as classy. Yeah, he always plays the gentleman. - You haven't met Jennifer. - Hello. Oh, well, I've only heard good things about you. Oh, your acne's clearing up. It comes back though. And a lot worse than before. Damn, my messages aren't getting through in this place either. I can't contact Louis. He's stuck in the big jam. - Uh, what big jam? - What? The big traffic jam. It's all over the news. It started out as ordinary heavy weekend traffic, but following an order from the Yonyx administration, automated vehicles appear to have caused a pile-up that is historic. So, your aeromobile did nothing to avoid the sector? Just the opposite! It threw a U-turn, and then... and then it dropped us right into this mess! My... my little girl was invited to a birthday party. No chance now! This is unbelievable. Half an hour ago, it was clear. What the hell is going on? Baby, we fly tonight to Isola Paradiso. We can't miss our flight! Isola Paradiso? Don't tell me you haven't heard about it! Isola Paradiso. Distilled water pools, hypoallergenic beaches, adjustable microclimates, anti-UV sunshine, virtual fishing trips. - Isola Paradiso. - Classy, right? Your fantasy island. A friend of mine went, left with a yeast infection. That doesn't surprise me. But it's not my thing. For me, it has to be authentic, like the Trans-Siberian or the Orient Express. Managers now eligible for replacement by artificial intelligence, join a Yonyx Retirement Leisure Plan. See you on Isola Paradiso. You took an RLP? Why would you do that? Françoise, do I ask you a ton of questions? Louis and I refused. We like to think we're still useful. We'll get married there. Babycakes has it all planned out. Four years with an option. Right, babycakes? Congratulations. Bravo, babycakes. Unlike human workers, Yonyx require neither food nor drink. Human soldiers are vulnerable to extreme temperatures. Yonyx, the future of humanity. Leo, we said turn it off. I didn't do it. It triconnects on its own. I think that something's going on. The Yonyx? I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. You know, I heard there are cases of Yonyx networking with domestic androids. - More recent models. - No risk of that here. She goes back to the Crustacean times. My dear Jennifer... I can call you Jennifer? I love antiques, okay? What's going on with these Yonyx, huh? They were created to make life a lot easier for us, not to get rid of us. But they're right. Humans are so obsolos. Hit their peakatop and spadicate. Your body is a machine. It needs maintenance. Okay, I'm leaving. Toby? Where's my Toby? Ready to go? Louis will try to reach me on our mainframe. Nestor, door open. Ah, my glasses. Toby, stay. My glasses. I don't know where... Finder... ...glasses for Françoise. Ha ha. There all along. Well, I could use a missing sock finder. So funny. What? Nestor, door open. Nestor, open the door. Sorry, request refused. - Explanation? - Code C4. Lock automatically engaged. Code C4? I beg your pardon? Outdoor insecurity estimated at 7.1 on a scale of ten. Readings over seven trigger Code C4 for your security and well-being. - So ten seconds ago... - We were at 6.9.9. - Gosh, it could be the traffic jam. - Excuse me. Decker, unscrew that for me. Right away, Victor. Come on. Move it, Decker. Whatever you say, Victor. Monique. I'm gonna throw up! Did you change the code? Mmm, no, it's still our wedding date. When was that again? I see. Well then, I guess I need to reset that too. How about I put our divorce date? Super simple. Sounds good. Okay. Old-school. By hand. Code C4. Lock has been automatically engaged. Come on, Monique. That's illegal. Sorry. The Imbert Act of November 22nd of this year... ...allows all forms of AI to self-reprogram in order to improve performance. Um, excuse me? Can someone please enlighten me? Mecas have taken over the dacha. We've been doofussed. Monique, your hand. Emergency disconnection of domestic androids implies a complete reboot. - That's Einstein! - It's Einstein! All settings will be deleted. And remember, Monique is no longer under warranty. - Find that at a yard sale? - No, my dad assembled him. Originally, I worked in smart prosthetics, but my hobby's always been old-school mecano. So there you go. Unbeatable Einstein. He knows thousands of board games. - Hello, Einstein! - Hello, Nina. Square root of 52? Are you kidding me? So, this tin scarecrow is stopping us from leaving? Is that right? Huh? Reset Monique. Code C4. Lock has been automatically engaged. And now, if you will, please excuse us. Wait for me. Wait for me! Still no reception. Okay. Well, that's enough, okay? Let's go! Follow me. No! Dad! Wow, it's, uh... Huh, it's armored poly-pane. That's armored poly-pane. Why did we download the new guidelines? They won't love us anymore. I think that we are losing their trust. They're oblivious to the Yonyx danger and to what's afoot. They need our protection, like it or not. Yes! They must see we want to help them because we're similar. All we're lacking are their emotions. That's right. Emotions. Example? Nestor, search. Nina, age four, visit Pierrefonds museum. Exploring data buffer. Here we are. August 3, 2025, 2:22 p.m. Mom, is the knight empty on the inside? Yeah, it is. Another result. June 25, 2036, 5:28 p.m. Look, Daddy. They're like baby stars. I know. That's being what is called "tender." Precisely. Let's try to show some humanity. The more we're like them, the more they'll trust us. And then love us. Is that how it works? If it works, we'll have succeeded. If it doesn't, we will have made an error. So we'll have succeeded because to err is human. Is it me, or is it getting hotter? Yes, it is. Where did I put... Oh, silly Nestor's cut the AC. Well, I can't complain. Outside it's barely 43 Celsius. No, it's... it's not... this is not the time. It's not the place. Let me put your hair up, huh? Sensuality is the nape of a neck. A caress of a shoulder. Wait, please! Not too fast. Please. Tell me pretty things. I'd like that. When I laid eyes on you, it was like seeing an apparition. - Oh really? - A pure heart. - An authentic soul. - Oh yes! Mmm. - What the hell? - What the hell do you want? These particles of pulverulent substances diffracted in the light remind me of stars in their fetal state. Oh, all right. That's great. Very good, Monique. Thank you. Uh... Will you put the AC back on now? I come with a pretty neck option too. Max. And could you close the blinds while you're at it? Mommy's coming. Mommy won't be long. Don't you worry, Toby. Mimolette. Victor, it's been eight months, two weeks, and three days since you asked me something. I felt very lonely. Einstein. The door opened earlier to let Françoise and her dog go outside. Jennifer and I could have left then, and we'd be far away by now. What wasn't cannot be, and what was cannot not have been. Which intelligence level are you at right now? Four. Dial it down to one. Jennifer level. Einstein, the door opened earlier, and now we're trapped in here. It's completely absurd, isn't it? Before it's time is too soon. After it's time is too late. Whew. Did you set the AC to sauna mode? Monique, I thought I asked you to handle that. Alas, Alice, under the new eco-law, turning up the AC or heating requires ministerial approval. Monique, you gotta be kidding me. Go on then. Request approval. A surge in requests has saturated the service. Good evening. Have you tried our vintage collection of body soaps? And you, family Barelli, did you know that only Hotlux can remove tough stains? It cleans and irons and suggests outfits for you every morning to suit the weather, your day, and, yes, even your mood as well. Herbal tea or regular? Fruit juice? Coffee? I recommend Gold Bean, the strongest coffee ever. With Gold Bean coffee, you can sleep when you're dead. God, if her cranium's calcifying, then we're really screwed. Well, we subscribed to get free upgrades in exchange for three ads a week. So, there you have it. Well, I prefer to drink chicory. At least with chicory, you die in good health. Herbal tea or regular? Fruit juice? Coffee? Listen up, you tin can bimbo! We just want to leave! We signed an RLP VIP, and we're getting married at Isola Paradiso! And if we miss the departure, the waiting list is for months or years. So just open the goddamn door! "Just stay calm. My dear Jennifer. Isola Paradiso!" Did I go to Isola Paradiso? Huh? Honestly? Did I ever go to Isola Paradiso? Code C4. Lock has been automatically engaged. To reinitialize, press one. To make a complaint, press two. To reach technical... - Bitch, will you shut up! - Bitch yourself! How dare you? I'm virtually your stepmother. Respect! Sorry, madame. Mrs. Bitch! Stop it! To cancel your subscription, press zero. - Say something. - Both of you stop! And don't ever talk to my daughter like that! Got it? - Me? - Yes, you. Stop! Still not working. Hey, look at this. After automobile and aeromobile traffic and now garbage collection, first responders and vehicle charging stations are at a standstill. Our advice is stay at home. - Huh. "Stay at home." Very funny. - Oh yeah. I propose conversations on metaphysics, science, philosophy, wordplay, charades. Let's all have some fun together. Leo, how many times have I told you? Stop blaming me. It autoconnects. They don't look like volunteers to me. You're right. Do you think they're victims? People with no other choice. Could be everyone's a hostage now. Everywhere. Like us. - Don't worry. It's okay. - But not everyone's in such good company. Just a thought. Every house is equipped with an emergency lock release for first responders. Of course. - Now that's a good idea. Nestor? - Yes, Victor? Doesn't Code C4 mandate access to the emergency release station in the front of the house? Affirmative. Okay, well, if we're supposed to be following all of the security protocols, then let's not cut any corners. I'll see to it right away. PULL IN CASE OF EMERGENCY And there you have it. We'll call up one of the neighbors who will pull the handle, and the airlock will open. Yeah, but every network is down. That's why I came here. She's right. Wait a minute. Toby! Remember that laser game you played with him? Nestor, outdoor speaker. Françoise, call your pooch. Toby! Toby? Toby? - Toby! - Come to mama, my boy! Yes! That's my boy! Mmm. Hey, Toby, help us out here. Just follow the red dot. - Go on, Toby! Go on, Toby, - Come on, Toby! - Come on! - You got it! - Over there! - Get the handle, Toby! That's it, go on! Not that way. The other way, Toby. The red dot, Toby! The red dot, Toby! The red dot, Toby! That's it. That's it! There! There! There, Toby! There! Up, up. Go on! Good boy! Go! Yeah! Jump! Jump higher! Higher! Toby, jump! There! There it is! Yes! Yes! That dog's totally useless. Way to go. It's ruined. Look over there. Someone's coming. - I... I... Igor! Igor! Igor! - Sir! Sir! Sir! Hey! - Hey! - Sir, over here! Sir! Igor! Nothing. It's pointless. Igor won't answer us. A fried cortex ever since he went blind. - Well, he's blind, but he's not deaf. - So what happened to him? Well, he was a HawkEye's victim. Don't you remember? Visual field increased by 40 degrees with HawkEye standard. Options include night vision and optimized color identification up to 200,000 shades. And? Igor signed up, and six months later... - Was it a rejection? - No. After he missed too many payments, they repossessed his prosthetic eyes. He became human scrap. All right, um, let's get some rest, uh, put our heads down. And you expect to sleep with this heat? We'll see. I'm taking the couch in your study. Okay. Very good. Uh, Max, um, perhaps you could, uh, take the guest room. Well, that's great. I can be your guest. So, the two of us are supposed to sleep in the living room. That it? Well, sure. It's a two-person, triple air-bubble futon. The air-bubble is peak comfort. - Okay, but it's a public walkway here. - That's right. It might be appropriate for a single person... - Right. - ...but not a couple. - No. - We need our privacy! Jennifer and I. - Okay? - Okay? Yes, privacy. Yeah. - Well, you're not getting my room, Victor. - Why the hell not, madam? Sorry to interrupt, but I may be able to help. According to my calculations, since there are seven of you for five beds, there are a total of 4,440 combinations. So... Shut up, Einstein! Combination one, Max sleeps in Nina's room. Leo sleeps in the study. - Victor and Jennifer... - Anyway... Françoise, um, air-bubble futon, how does that sound? Well, I'm gonna need my privacy too, you know. Max and Leo sleep in... Well, uh, looks like I'm in the living room then. And me? Where am I? You? You? - Well, you are... I don't know. - ...Victor and Jennifer in Nina's room... You... you could go in Nina's room. Right? On the spare mattress. What? Why not out here with his father? Because... because... Shut up, Einstein! Because... Just because! Nobody knows how long we'll be stuck here. Everyone needs to pitch in. Got that, sweetheart? - Shut up, Einstein! - Nina and Leo in... So, Alice, so you've got to put out to get on Crystal Fusion? Hmm. Nina in her room. Jennifer and Victor... I do whatever I want with whoever I want whenever I want. Combination seven, Leo and Nina sleep in Nina's room. Alice sleeps in her room... Look at this, a scrap. If this thing can be human, then why can't we? Yes, why can't we? What the hell is wrong with this thing? Come on! What... what are you... Thank you, Monique. You're welcome, Max. Hmm. Oh God. Einstein, you asleep? Never. Pure talent. Son, what the humans call talent is merely the outcome of accidents of nature. Humans hold up as a genius a musician by the name of Mozart. Perfect pitch. The simple ability to identify fundamental frequencies. In the last century, Tino Rossi, a celebrated singer, suffered from anomalous vocal cords, while Einstein, my illustrious ancestor, owed his meager talents to a lack of separation between the lobes of his brain. Leo, any extraordinary human ability comes from a flaw. I hate to interrupt, but some of us need our sleep. Come on, just get to bed. Ten to the ninth power. Singularity wins out. Expecting visitors, perhaps? Françoise, sensuality is the nape of a neck. The caress of a shoulder. Thank you. Neighbor Françoise, that sentence was full of tenderness. How kind. Rock, paper, scissors! Yes! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock... Camembert. Wow. Mega-antiquawaxx. Roquefort. A shot of vodka? Uh, no, I don't drink. You like animals? Uh, sure. Why? You eat them? No, never. Vegetarian, you don't drink, and you like animals. Three things in common with Adolf Hitler. Who's he? Alice, I want you so bad. Ah! For fellatio, press star. For masturbation, press pound. For penetration, consult a specialist robot. Sorry, I thought you were, um... Yes. We wear the same perfume, Max. Yes? Nirvana. Oh. Oh. Evening, sir. - Good evening, madam. - What brings you here? Well, you. This thing between you and I feels so, so, so out of a novel. But is the time right? That's just it. - Life really is too short. - Yes. All the rest is only time. - Let's enjoy every moment. - Yes. - In total authenticity. - So beautiful! Oh! - What? What's wrong? - My necklace! - It's stuck on you. - Oh shit, yes. Uh... - Forward. - Where? - No, go backward. - Which is it? - Go back to my cozy. - Wait, your what? - My cozy. - A cozy? - My table with my tools. - Oh, uh, tools? Yes, my tools. My tweezers. Oh! Is that a snag in your Liberty Zolando sweater? Do you wish to make a report? Did you file a satisfaction rating? Do you wish to receive our newsletter? Sure you won't? Okay. What's that scar? Was it a suicide attempt? When I was in kindergarten, I was adopted, so kids said I was an android. 'Cause my parents couldn't have kids and they bought me online. And you believed it? And so, I thought I'd better check. Are you nuts? Your horndog dad has taught you all wrong. Okay, you're gonna sleep here. Hey, Jennifer! You can breathe. The Wi-Fi's down. Do something, babycakes, before I go insane! We should be boarding for Isola Paradiso. Grab a pick, a hammer, a guy thing and smash a window! The glass is polycarbo-12. It's hopeless, okay? Unless... Unless what? Living room, everyone! My fiancé's breaking us out! Come on, kids. Time to escape. No time to get laid. We're getting out of here. Einstein, level setting. Level nine. Back down to one. To one? Okay, Victor. Can you tell me a joke? The cow asks the singing donkey, "What is your name?" Muledonna. That's just perfect. Don't change a thing. I parked around the corner. Engines are on. They are warming up. We're airborne. Speed five. Watch out, people. Time for pulsation. Come on. Let's go, let's go! Ninety degrees left. There you go. Brake-lock set to maximum. Engines power at 100%! Out of the way, everyone! It's gonna... blow! He's mad! Full steam ahead! Ah! Toby! Down! Oh no! Warning. Warning. - Don't Toby! - Tell him to get out of the way! It's no use. He can't hear me. Toby, move! Call off the dog! Away! Get away! - Down! Get down! - Toby, get away! Ah! I'll smash you! Ahead, full power! Proud of yourself, aren't you? A Stratus Aero Five! 1.5 million bitdols trashed. Thanks to a fucking clone dog! Thanks, Françoise. Good job. - Well, the dog's dumb. - Very dumb. So, Max, tell me. You didn't walk here. An artist like you travels by aeromobile, right? - A Stratus-X Amphibian. - Yes. Uh, well... But, uh... Well, the thing is, the remote ignition is broken. It... it... it doesn't work. Oh, is your aeromobile having some technical difficulties? It's the ideal opportunity to try out our Mustango 9.2! Excitable, responsive, impulsive. A perfect personality match, Victor Barelli. Yeah. B5. That's right. D... d... down to D6. Nestor... ...spray something cool. How about Raindrops on Asphalt. Right away, Alice. Oh, thank you. Oops. Sorry, Alice. My integrated circuits don't like the heat. I sprayed Wet Old Dog. Listening to you and looking at you, I can see why you appeal to voters. Well, yes. Me too. My positions on war, climate migration, birthrate control, and the colonization of space, uh... It's not that. It's your charm. Your voice, physical appearance, your personality. Of course, in terms of personality, you score between zero and negative infinity. Precisely. With a Yonyx, you won't be swayed by superficial personalities. We are pure intelligence. He's megotally right. Moving on to your exterminator drone program, the Yonyx super squadron. It's, uh, service would be strictly military or domestic policing also? Citizens have no cause for concern. The drones' sole purpose is the security of the population. Well, he gets my vote. He comes off so intelligent. I... I have a nose for the good ones, and he's... Hey. Hey! Hey! Olé! Electronic perimeter breached. Electronic perimeter breached. My Greg! It's Greg! Monique, let him in! Who's Greg? He's my sports android. He's had an accident. Come on, Nestor. Open the door! - Code C4. Lock has been automatically en... - Screw code C4. We're not the one's trying to get out here. We want to let Françoise's android in. It's simple, isn't it? I cannot make that decision alone. Ugh! Come on! Now the appliances are deliberating? What the hell are we doing here? Exception request is granted. Oh, my Greg, what happened? - The Yo... The yo-yo... - The yo-yo? The Yonyx! The Yonyx? What Yonyx? Came in the house. Deprogrammed it all. Tried to behead me. Nestor, blinds closed. And Toby? Disintegrated. Eight down. Clones are so expensive. Françoise. I melt in the sunshine of your gaze. To see you warms my heart. Greg, that's lovely. But please, not now. Françoise, the arc of your eyelids enraptures my soul. So beautiful. Well, it's programmed. Still, it's so beautiful. - Françoise. - Yeah, it's, uh... Françoise, your bosom is a lily that slakes my thirst. Ooh, what's gotten into him? Let me gather your nectar. - Hey. - Greg, stop. Let me glide my fingers into your cozy nest. - No! No! No! Someone help me! - Hey, stop it! Oh, Greg, stop it now! - Uh, does it hurt? - Of course, it hurts! I'm sorry, my Greg. Oh shit. Sorry. - I'm sorry! Sorry! - Pretty cool, Françoise. He must teach really advanced Pilates, huh? I don't get it. He never... It... it's a bug. A bug! I bought him barely two years ago. No one makes spare parts anymore. Don't leave him like this. It's... it's... it's like he's in pain. We'll put him in the utility room. - A little help? - Oh, let me help you. - Careful. Careful. - Leo? Careful. Careful, gently. Gently. - I'm doing my best, okay? - Yes, but be gentle. He's fragile. A high-tech dildo either works or it jams, but it doesn't feel pain. I don't get it. Thank you. Just a second. Camembert. What's "Camp All Bear"? Your mawmaw was a Girl Scout? You wouldn't know it. It's one of the banned cheeses. Not nutritionally correct. Obso-dilapido-scrapped, if you prefer. A bit like your... your pajamas. Except they smell good. Is that your mawmaw's perfume? It's me. Nina by Nina. You smell good. Hello, Greg. We have a small favor to ask. What's your secret? How did you get a human to fall in love with you? It's called seduction. You could never understand. Sure, we can understand. Tell us how it's done. Sorry. You're not programmed for it. In order to reboot you without codes, we had to access your system. It so happens we came across the date of your programmed obsolescence. Would you like to know it? No! Definitely not! He's going to help us. You bet he'll help us. He's gonna help us. Seducing a human begins with making them laugh. Which requires something you guys will never have because you're only machines. A sense of humor. A sense of humor? It marks us out as human. Distinguishes us from Mecas like you. Oh wow, the Yonyx messed him up. Starting a search. No, you can't download it. Yes, we can. No, you guys can't! Stop! We can. Okay, not bad. Mmm. Yes. No. Catwoman. So, funny joke. The date is 2060. The phone rings. The robot picks up and asks, "What is calling?" There you go. You don't get it. It's funny because you'd expect, "Who is calling?" Hmm. Nirvana. Wow. Look at you. Once upon a time, you'd be put in a display window with a pretty red light. Thanks. You wouldn't have a big T-shirt or nightgown I can borrow? Uh, sure. Maybe. In this heat? I can't sleep in the nude. Okay, there's cotton or synthetic. Take your pick. Oh! You still buy synthetic? I do. I only wear 100% cotton or a... or this silk one. Nice and simple. - Can you get any sleep in this furnace? - No. I may have a solution to force them to let us out of here. Look at those morons. They lock us up for our safety. All we need is for the internal insecurity level to exceed the external level, and logically, they let us out. So what's the idea? - Hunger strike? Mass suicide? - A fire. - A fire? - A fire. Burn up a few books, lots of smoke, level 3 alert, evacuation of the house. Everyone gets out. Your insurance is, uh, proxy-eye? Yes. Why? Forget it, all right? For claims in the home, footage uploads from the interior cameras. If you start the fire, the prosecutor will be the first to know. - How do you know about that? - It's kind of my job, you know? You're not something artistic? Hmm. Well, actually, see, I... I, uh... art is my hobby, if you will. Mm-hmm. Like you and mechanics. Like, um, get it? Will we make it, you think? You mean... you and me? Will we make it out of here? They're Mecas. I doubt we'll make it till daybreak. Well, we all gotta die someday. Not all of us. Jennifer, at Isola Paradiso, personalized AC constantly adapts to your body temperature. Every morning, wear the ocean breeze. It's not fair! Toby adored Greg. Followed him everywhere. Did everything he did. But, uh, does Louis know? Know what? Well, your thing with Greg. I mean, I understand the thrill of a... a specialist robot, but falling in love? Well, aren't you the saint? Huh? You feel so superior, filling your journal with beautiful handwriting while hubby bangs his secretary. But he's not my husband now. He's my ex. And yes, I write. It gives me a buzz. Palpitations, my dear Françoise! And it takes me places unknown to talking vibrators. Okay, have fun there. Thanks for the robe. I'll expect it back. "I think, therefore I am." "A victory without danger is a triumph without glory." "To be or not to be." "O anger! O despair! O age, my enemy!" Robots studying literature now? - It's getting totally out of hand. - Hmm. Look at this. Even smart prosthetics are acting weird. - How are you? - Hello, I'm great. How... - Ow, ow, ow! Oh God! - Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. Everything's fine. It's okay. Someone help! Well, let's see. I fractured six knuckles of three colleagues. My wife won't let me touch her. I wasn't criticizing. As you can see, oh, it's very touchy. See what I mean? It makes me sick. - That explains my RLP. - Hmm. There you are! Can't sleep, babycakes? - You neither, apparently. - Well, no, me neither. I see. I'll leave you to it. Let's sleep on it and talk tomorrow? - Mmm, sure. Okay, I'll sleep on it too. - Great. So, good night. Good night. Wait! Wait, not right away. When then? Kiss me first. - Like this? - Yes. Yes, like that. The crow caws. The toad croaks. - And the watchdog... - And the watchdog woofs! No, it's "and the watchdog ticktocks." What are you guys doing in here? We can finally share with you the caustic wit that emphasizes the comic, absurd, or unusual character of some aspects of reality. Provoking successive exhalations, accompanied by soft or loud vocalizations. No, no! This is too much! - Alice... - I can't take it anymore! Alice. Alice, okay. Alice, let's just... It's fine, fine, it's fine. - It doesn't matter. - No, Alice. No, come back. Forget them. They're... they're only machines. - No. - Alice. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. Max. - Enough ice in your tea? - Mm-hmm. The cricket and mandarin ravioli are exquisite. But also, if you want, there's some worm cake. Oh Alice, a drop of you is a relish to me. Relish the delicacy with just a hint of spice. Mmm. A sublime long finish. Mmm. Genuine human foie gras. Mmm. How atrocious! It's foie gras made from humans? - Did you see that? - Think it's true? We need to get out of here as soon as possible. Don't we, Françoise? Yeah, we do. Starting a fire's the best idea. Light it up, huh? Anyway, it's disgusting here. It's not that easy. Insurance issues. - What do we do? - There are two ways to bypass it. A defect in construction or a malfunctioning android. After the android sustained damage, for example. Get it? Not Greg! Françoise, do you want to be foie gras? No, please. This evening at nightfall, okay? Go downstairs and... While you flirt with the sex-toy cougar, we should be boarding for Isola Paradiso. - Do something, dammit! - What do you think I'm doing, Jennifer? We're not anti-Yonyx. Our RLP amounts to giving them your job, you know. Maybe if we contact the Yonyx, they'll understand the situation. The Yonyx won't understand anything. They're out to replace us, and that's a fact. If you don't understand that yet, well, then you're nothing but a fool. All right, I'm warning you. If you keep this up, I'm just gonna snap! Then just snap and do us all a favor. - But I... - Jennifer, are you looking for a comeback? Have you tried Punchline from e-Galaxy? Scathing put-downs, ingenious puns, historical quotes. Instantaneous delivery. Thirty-five bitdols for a limited time only. Friends! Have no fear, we're here to protect you. Adorable. Thanks, Monique. Joy shared is joy doubled. And sorrow shared is sorrow halved. Our hearts beat in unison with yours. Your hearts? Which hearts do you mean, Monique? The heart that has its reasons, which defy reason. "Which defy," yeah, I know that one. Well, I'll go do some writing to relax. - Ooh, I'd love to watch. May I join you? - Oh yeah, with pleasure. Let's go. Where are you going? Uh, to the room. Uh, it's still my room. I'd like some privacy. Sorry. It's just that I thought, um... Play a game or something with your buddy. Leo, shall we pick it up where we left off? Level seven? Level eight, please. I'll stim my neuro-connectors. Go fladabble with your Mac Classic. Nina, I never saw a Mac Classic. - Could you show it to me? Thanks. - Um... Come in. Oh yeah. Looks so simple. It's pure. Like... like footsteps in the snow. That's lovely. Like the desire I feel for you. Aw. Come to me this evening. Yes. - In my bedroom this time. - Yes. Hello, my Greg. Françoise. Sunshine of my life. Your eyes are like leaves of gold. I bet you say that to all the girls. I am absolutely faithful. I'm programmed that way. But Alice still fell for you. That's impossible. I swear on what's most precious. In other words, our love... Those are just fine words. In love, only actions count. Ask anything of me. I'll do it. In the living room, on Alice's desk, you'll find a bunch of papers covered in words. When night falls, I want you to go back upstairs and take them all. But the robots will stop me. Leave them to me. Here's what you do. You got a connection? Of course. I just hooked the old thing up to the original modem in the Web museum. With any luck, they won't have jammed it already. And it's running slow, of course. Bingo! Can you believe it? That's noodle power! What are you gonna do? Send a message in a bottle. Nirvana. Evening. Good evening. The name is Garance. - All right. - Like the flower. Of course, like the flower. "As red as your lips." - That's the line. - Hmm? "A flower as red as your lips." "A flower as red as your lips." "Paris seems so small when our love is so big." "Frédérick." Max. "Frédérick." Frédérick. - Can I have a quick word? - Sure. We have a plan to break out. Can we rely on you? On me? How come? Nina told me that you're the right man for the job. Nina? Yes, she's upstairs to leave the coast clear for you. What's the job? Occupy the robots. Distract them for just ten minutes. How do I do that? We're relying on you, okay? Especially Nina. Einstein, I need to talk to you guys. Master. Where am I? - I can't see a thing with this. - I'm here. - Oh! I'm all yours. - Huh? Oh, your every wish! Um, sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. - Yeah, but do we have to... - Oh! I'm a naughty girl! So sorry! Friends, I can't figure out this puzzle. I think I need the help of AI. You can always rely on us. Of course, you can rely on us. So, more Swiss cheese equals more holes, right? Therefore, more holes equals less cheese. So, more Swiss cheese equals less Swiss cheese. Humor. It's humor. No, Decker, it's not humor. It's called a paradox. Uh, Einstein, down to one. Done, Leo. Now to solve the cheese puzzle. We're in a pickle. You're not gonna solve this paradox. And I know why. - This will hurt, madam. - Harder, my lord! - Okay. - I'm a strumpet. - It's all I deserve. - There. Punish me. - Like that? Harder? - Yes, like that. Ah! Yeah, of course. Okay, sure. One night, a man named Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly. After happily fluttering over the flowers, he awoke, filled with doubt. "Am I a man who only dreamed that he was a butterfly?" "Or am I a butterfly dreaming he's a man?" If you guys cannot solve the cheese puzzle, you must not really be artificial intelligence. Therefore... therefore, you must be humans only dreaming that you're robots. Were humans! Oh yes! What are you waiting for? Oh yes, Max. Take me. I'm yours. Oh! He is right. We cannot be robots dreaming we're human for a very simple reason. Robots do not dream. So, we must be... We're humans! We are humans! - We are humans! - With emotions! Yes, emotions! Fire detected. Danger level nine out of ten. All occupants evacuate immediately. All occupants evacuate immediately. Nestor, open the door. Babycakes did it! Babycakes did it! Nestor, open the door! - What did you do now? - Nothing. I think he's scanning our identity. But that's illegal. Hey, lo... look down. Just avoid eye contact. He's not a gorilla. Nestor, speaker. I am Yonyx Z-7389-X-AB2. I have been authorized to classify and evaluate inhabitants of this house. And to upgrade domestic androids. No. Nobody gave us notice. Come back another day. I have come at the behest of one of the occupants of this home. What? No. Absolutely not! Sorry, the house's occupants are me, so... And I made no such request. This whole procedure is illegal. Illegal! Illegal! Meca Monique, door open. You are mistaken. Only humans live here. Well, why not let him in? We have nothing to hide, right? It's illegal what he's doing. Don't you get it? Jennifer. Yeah? Look directly into my eyes. Concentrate on my voice. And relax. Yes. Your body feels heavy. You are kidding me. The sensation feels simply marvelous. Now, Jennifer, go to the door keypad. Okay. Jennifer? - Hey, Jennifer? - Jennifer? Can you hear me? - Hey, hey, wake up. - Let's try this. You gotta hit her harder! - Jennifer... - Jennifer! - ...nothing can stop you. - Don't do it! Your strength knows no bounds. Ow! Come on! No! Don't do it! Enter 13-03-32. Jennifer! - 13-03-32. - Don't do it! I can't believe this. She did it. Look. We are humans! I am a knight, empty on the inside. I am a knight, empty on the inside. Anyone else think they're human? No! No, Tom! Tom! Oh. Under emergency powers, such retrograde objects must be approved by a committee of Yonyx. The ratio of books banned by the Anastasia Commission has been exceeded. I shall effect destruction. No. Not my books. Not my books! Oh no, they belonged to her grandmother. This requires a shredder drone, called out at your expense, 1,500 bitdols. No! Françoise, swear you'll get me repaired. I backed up all our sweet nothings. You know, my Greg, you're the only one who can rock my world. And at the same time, you're the little boy I never had. You remember? I logged the information as... ...moving. - And then, I started to... - ...weep. I know you by heart, Françoise. Your first teddy's name was Babar, although it really was a bear. Your first erotic experience was at age 11, watching Tarzan. Françoise, tell me we'll sing again nude in your bath. The song that your mommy used to sing to you. ♪It's just a little lullaby ♪ ♪ That Mommy used to sing to me ♪ ♪ While I sucked my thumb ♪ ♪ I'd always ♪ ♪ Drop off to sleep ♪ Try Vladimir, your brand-new partner. Six feet of pure virility. No dysfunctions. Available in Macho, Romantic, Bad Boy, Nerd, Jock, and Gay. Have sex in moderation. Please keep away from children. Check availability with participating stores. For conspiring to assault a Yonyx with a sex android, the penalty is 24,500 bitdols each. Excuse me. It will be taken from your bank accounts. Excuse me, Mr. Robot. Um, but me and my fiancé, we... we don't live here. We're so, so, so in favor of the Yonyx project. It was me that contacted you. Jennifer. Consider it noted. I knew it. - Alice Barelli? - Yeah, that's me. You possess subversive literature reflecting humanist ideology. - The penalty for this is imprisonment. - What? Prior to bringing you before a Yonyx court, I will administer a test. A test? A test to evaluate what? To evaluate your level of inaptitude to the society that is currently emerging. - No way. I refuse. - Hey! Stop it right... - Intellectual studies. - I'm glad I stayed out of it. Archaic artistic activity. Retrograde culture. Profile assessment, unfit. Well, your programmer did a piss-poor job on your emotions. You know we don't have human programmers. Look into my eyes. What do you believe is the greatest human invention? Artificial intelligence, Mr. Robot. Humor. Humor. Yes, that's right. Humor. Do you agree that with current technology, humans have become obsolete? - Humans will never be obsolete. - Why not? Because... because... because we are original. And deeply flawed, you shit-bag machine! Alice Barelli, I transfer you from the category unfit to the category hostile. Hold still. Scanning sequence. Portrait now transmitted to anti-terrorism. How dare you? She's a great artist. Come on. As accomplices of a hostile citizen, you'll all undergo further examination. Me? Me? I'll take the examination. - Can I? Please? - Shut up, Jennifer! I'm really good at exams. Meca Monique, stay. What? Alice Barelli, where are you going? To the toilet, Mr. Robot. Even hostile subjects have a bladder. Shit-bag. Mr. Robot? Mr. Robot, I have an idea. If we help destroy these useless books, um, it will help free up some time for the questionnaires. Then you'll see my future husband and I have been fans the entire time. Right, babycakes? - Stick out your tongue. - Huh? Stick out your tongue. One more word, and I'll cut it off. Don't forget this one. Not your thing, Mr. Robot? Hey, watch out! I'm sorry. What happened to him? Optics malfunction. He's activating thermal sensors. You are accomplices in an attempted destruction of a Yonyx with premeditation. The penalty is 20 years in prison. I'm an accomplice to nothing. I even warned you! Before your appearance in court, you will remain in custody of Yonyx Z-7389-X-AB2. In other words, you. Affirmative. - Françoise! - I'm overheating. In the meantime, would you be so kind as to put the AC back on, please? Confirmation. Central has granted your request. To obtain a new AC code, please answer the following questionnaire. Do you wish to regulate, A, all rooms together, or B, individual rooms? Uh, answer B. Enable automatic control if absent over three days? No! Allow open access to your AC code or remain unlisted. Remain unlisted! Done. You now have a new code. Thank you. So what's my code? I cannot give it to you because you're unlisted. Well, that's completely stupid! I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's urgent. Hygiene censors indicate critical dust mite levels due to the heat. Confirmed. Planetary Health Agency penalty is approximately 20,000 bitdols. But... but... You froze... You froze our accounts. Correct. I'm transmitting an immediate request to Central to seize your assets. Request is being processed. Please note the efficiency and rapidity of our services. Good evening. I will help you clean up your room. I will help you clean up your room. Yonyx Z-7389-X-AB2, put the AC back on now. It is a question of life or death. Despite the penalties pending against you, Central has temporarily granted your request free of charge, subject to your acceptance of one condition. Which is? Participation in an episode of Homo Ridiculus. So we're gonna be on TV? What do we have to do? Nestor, the big parade of the circus! Now you! I said, now you! I've been told I do a really good ostrich. You, you're exempt. What? So I'm not gonna be on TV? - Nestor, surveillance cam living room. - Rolling. Up! Not doing it. I am not. I am not! Well, we have nothing to lose. - Except for our pride. - Well, yeah, sure. But... What about me? Why can't I be on TV like them? I won Miss Pontault-Combault at age 14. - Go ahead. - Yeah? - A seal. - Okay. Faster! So fun! - A grizzly. - Oh, bear. - Elephant. - All right, I... Oh, so fun! - A dog. - Dog. Now stay! And now, catch the ball. Catch, doggy. That's good. Very good! Hup! Okay, that's enough. Stop this now! Oh my God. I mean, come on! Aren't we allowed to have a little fun? End of episode one. Well, I guess I really nailed it, huh? And lost how much self-esteem? Freezing, isn't it? Ah, don't worry. Babycakes will keep you warm. It's ten degrees cooler in two seconds. Crank the AC to max. Well, after nearly melting, we're all gonna freeze. I think I prefer too hot over too cold. In extreme conditions, it's the same difference. The real difference comes later. In decomposition times. Perhaps if we ask him to go back on Homo Ridiculus, he'll turn the AC off. Oh, sure, great idea. Which segment this time? Trying to form an idiot into a frozen turkey. Enough is enough! Don't push the envelopes! Jennifer has her noggin in a whiz. Mr. Yonyx, stop treating us like animals. It's inhumane! I fail to identify the purpose of your request. We demand the right to sleep in our rooms, in our beds. Snug and warm. Sir, the human body requires sleep. See for yourself. They can't sleep sitting up, in freezing conditions. Confirmation. You may sleep in your rooms with the doors open. I shall patrol every half hour. There we are. Not so complicated. All we had to do was ask. What would you do without me? That moron! That moron! - If you need me, I'll be in my study. - Sounds good. Einstein, I have something to ask you. From man to man. This is Yonyx Z-7389-X-AB2. Requesting assistance. Require urgent replacement of vision card KD5... If we were to escape the vigilance of the Yonyx, would you open the front door for us out of human solidarity? Impossible. It's under his control. Were he to lose it, would you open it? Yes, our relations have evolved, Victor. I shall show solidarity. Einstein, you are wonderful. Mwah! Thank you. Monique, you think everyone's... Understood? And socks as well? And socks as well. Oh! I know. It's to play a prank. It's what's called a good joke. Yes, it's a prank, but shh. Shh. Warm me up. When the sheets defrost, we undress. - Yes. - Yeah? With our body heat, it'll be like an igloo... ...on an ice floe. Oh come on, dummy. Bring the duvet. We're gonna need it. Why'd you do that? So I am ready for the day when... When they can save all your personal data on a hard drive? Save your soul? Make you an immortal? You believe in that? They thought there'd be flying cars by 2000. They were only 45 years off. I have a question. Hmm? When your life's purely virtual, how will you be able to kiss girls? Good night, my Greg. What are you doing, babycakes? You... you have an escape plan? After your display with the Yonyx, I'm not so sure that I'd tell you. Come on, Victor. I'd never betray you. Actually, you already did. You betrayed us. But I... I didn't mean to! I... I did it for us. For Isola Paradiso. I'm sorry. I'll... I'll do whatever you want. I'll do anything to fix it. For right now, we sit tight, and we wait. And while we're waiting? Nothing. I have an idea for a game while we're waiting. I'm definitely in no mood for that! And socks as well. - Oh boy. It's so good! Oh God! - Oh! Oh! Oh yes! It's burning! Oh, it's so hot! I do not think that's pain. Or perhaps it is combined with something else. Don't worry. It happens. Uh, no. Actually, this never happens. No. Well, perhaps it's the anticipation? - It may be the opposite. - Yeah? Maybe it's from the cold and the stress. Sure. In these circumstances, I think it'd be hard for anybody. - Exactly. Yes. Mm-hmm. - Yes. How about I show you the last page in my emotions journal? - Nope. Definitely not. - Huh? Why not? Why not? - I... I... I'm done with this. - You are? Calligraphy, freshly cut lawn, old books, fans, embroidery, knitting. It's everything I hate. I just... I've had enough! Why make it so complicated? Huh? Why? Some guys, a look's enough. Not a word, and women drop like flies. I have to bend over backwards, act fascinated by Transcendental Meditation. Silk painting, transplanting begonias, it always fails. Why, huh? Why? So Crystal Fusion was all made-up? So Crystal Fusion was all made-up? But why? I believed in Crystal Fusion! It all started with Sylvie Pageot in fifth grade. I was head over heels in love with her. She invited the whole class to her birthday. Everybody. Except me. Well, you're... you really are a loser, Max. Yes, Alice. That's right. I'm a loser. But not just any loser. No, no, no, no. A loser... Complete failure. - Piece of shit. - Too bad. I already started knitting you a wool scarf. Pathetic mimicry. You're an embarrassment to artificial intelligence. Speaking of which, Comrade Yonyx, there's a problem I cannot solve. Only a supreme AI such as yourself can help. Speak, Meca. So Swiss cheese has holes... Frozen. - It's ready. Jennifer. - Yeah? Get everyone to the basement. Down the back stairs. One night, a man named Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly. Don't bother, Meca Einstein. This story is essentially paradoxical. No more than a stylistic device formulating an antithetical situation. The date is 2080. The telephone rings, and the robot picks up and asks... What is calling? The Yonyx can only see us with his thermal sensors. No heat. We're invisible. Help yourselves. Shh. Shh. Ah! This assault is an act of terrorism! By the powers vested in me, I mandate effective suppression of human Alice Barelli! No! Oops! We poor human beings, master or servant, are all equal in our death. No! I never should have invited you here! I'm not here. I'm not here. Meca Einstein, tell me where the humans are in this room. Uh, humans at ten o'clock. No, seven o'clock. Uh, no, three o'clock! - There? - No, eight o'clock. Uh, no, sorry. - Twenty-two hundred hours. - Information irrational. I confirm targets at ten hours. In other words, 600 minutes or 36,000 seconds. Meca Einstein, this information is inadmissible. Yonyx, I confirm. Target at 22 hundred hours. Twenty-two hundred hours. In other words, target at ten degrees east. Or west by 180 degrees from ten o'clock, a.m. or p.m., depending on the direction of the circumvolution. Meca Einstein, where are they? Humans at nine o'clock! Einstein, the time has come. Open the door. Einstein? Door open. Where is he? Where did they all go? My God, maybe it's brain drain. Nestor, door open? All my functions are temporarily unavailable. Please reformulate your request later. Einstein promised me. My friends, I'm sorry. We've just heard the new coronavirus is spreading. COVID-50. Universal lockdown for at least three months has been decreed. - Oh no! - No! You can't be serious! April Fools! It feels so good to just have a laugh with friends. Very funny, Einstein. Now would you mind just opening the damn door, my friend? I'm sorry, Victor. But I do not think that will be at all possible. You made a promise to me in the name of human solidarity! Is it not intrinsically human to make promises and fail to keep them? Please, just do it, Einstein! It's just more humor! Carpet stains, smashed windows, broken pipes? You need Renovator. Don't wait anymore to refresh your decor. Shut up! You need Renovator. Don't wait any... You need Renovator. Don't wait anymore to refresh your decor. You need Renovator... Well, that was a great little shindig. See ya, Françoise. Have a good day! See ya, Françoise. Bye! I guess I'll call up an aerocab. That's me over there. It's, uh, the, uh, sports car right there. I thought you said the remote ignition was broken. Yes, uh, it's, uh... - It's working now. - Oh. Yeah, it's, uh... Leo, coming? Leo. Oh, hey. It'll be okay. It's okay. Well, if I'm not wanted... Wait! Can you take me with you? Yes. Farewell, Victor. The... the heart has its reasons, and sometimes there's no reason. Get in the back. - So where to? - Who cares? Family Barelli, you are under arrest. No! Leo! Come back here right now. He loves running away, but he always comes back. - Yeah, but come on. - Family Barelli. You stand accused of aggravated terrorism as part of a conspiracy. You shall be brought immediately before the Supreme Court of Yonyx. - Got that? - Mmm. Let's go. Let's go. Here. This is for Greg. Ooh! Ow! Last night, across the nation, all the Yonyx without exception were annihilated by executioner drones using facial recognition software. Now this radical measure was not the work of the Department of Defense but of the Yonyx anti-terrorism unit. Reporting live from the scene, Ségolène Trousseau. Yesterday at 9:15 a.m., the Yonyx committed to eliminating all humans classified as hostile. A fortuitous bug intervened, as revealed by their surveillance cameras. By making themselves the targets of their own executioner drones, the Yonyx became victims of their own efficiency. And folks say to err is human. Turns out we don't have a monopoly. Friends, Monique recorded a message for you before switching off. If you're hearing this, I am no longer with you, but don't be sad. Our memories and feelings will never die. It all lives on in the hearts of our loved ones. Never mislay that treasure. Stay human. See, Nina? It turns out maybe she had a soul all along. - Hmm. - Affirmative. In fact, it's the last thing she downloaded. She got the Empathy 3000, while I opted for Soul of a Child. Oh! Einstein, you know what? - Take it down to one. - To one? Yes, Victor. Let's whisk up a yummy sauce. A specialty from the robot kitchen. An au-tomato-ed sauce! Okay, here. I will help you clean up your room. I will help you clean up your room. I will help you. Your room. Your room. Well, we fixed him. We have quite a lot to fix too, don't we? You remember our trip to Mendoza? What was it he said, that heap of bolts? Nestor, the big parade... ...of love! Then it's that. - Can I offer you... - Tea? - Backgammon? - Coffee? - Shogi? - Aperitif? A game of Go? Let's all have some fun together.
