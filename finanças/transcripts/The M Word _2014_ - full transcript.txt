(birds chirping) - I feel as if I don't have any control of anything that's going on. Sometimes I can be really happy and sometimes I can just feel like everything's crashing down on me and that people are really mean to me and I don't know how to deal with it. I feel really weak sometimes. Like right now, the only other time I felt like this is when you stopped breastfeeding when you were eight months old and I didn't know what my purpose was anymore because you didn't want me to feed you and then your father started running around and he left and I didn't know what I was supposed to do with my life. I felt like nobody loved me and I had to figure out what I was doing in my life. - What is your emotional life like right now inside? - I feel as if I don't have any control of anything that's going on. - Mommy, look into the camera. - And I can't contain it. That's why I'm leaving Mack. - Aunt Rita? - I, I tell myself that it's body chemistry and this is just a chemical thing but it's very, very real. - Aunt Lulu. - I think about death 24 hours a day. I'm completely obsessed with death. - You go to doctors and you try to figure out what the best thing is. - I want to kill everybody at all times. - I know that I've got to get blood tests to find out what my hormone levels are. - Supplements. - Some other being inhabits me sometimes and I just get, like, wacky. - Suddenly the legs have to be open and nothing can have contact with each other and the hair has to be up and I'm panting, literally sticking my tongue out, panting like a dog, go like. (panting) - Trying to figure out how to balance this chemistry. - And then take medicine and creams and all that kind of stuff. - We each have a coping, so my mine is humor. - My husband brings me a cup of coffee and says, "Good morning, sweetheart," and I wanna kill him. - I used to rollerblade in my bikini on Venice Beach. Remember? - I wanna kill him in really creative and painful and specific ways. (laughing) And then I wanna have sex. (dramatic music) - Good evening, folks, welcome to "Mack Riley's Extreme Sports." Now, as everyone who loves surfing knows, Mother Nature's giving southern California surfers a real Thanksgiving treat this week as huge waves are hitting the California coastline. This is the same swell that's been pounding Hawaii for the last week, actually more specifically, it's been hitting Oahu, the North Shore, where the Haleiwa Surfing Championship is taking place, the first leg of the Hawaiian Triple Crown of surfing, some of the biggest waves ever ridden. Those waves are finally here, and all of you big-wave surfers, it's time to wax up your big guns and paddle out. I'll probably be out there with you. At the same time, the local mountain ranges are starting to look pretty good to skiers and snowboarders, so this may be an opportunity for you to do what I like to call a boarder's double dip, where you surf in the morning, you ski in the afternoon. - It's okay, just feel your feelings, just. (inhaling) We all feel jealous. - It's one of those advantages of living in southern California, where you have the. - Just because we don't feel that we're enough inside and we just have to learn that we are enough. - 365 days a year, I haven't done that in a few years but this is an opportunity to give it a go. (dramatic music) - Another great day, guys. Another good show in the can, Mack. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Thanks for taking your time to come in here. I wanna share a little something with you. I'd like to get some feedback. Angela here came to me earlier today and shared some information. I didn't want you to hear it through the grapevine, so you're gonna get it straight from he horse's mouth. - What's going on? - I know I'm still new. I don't want to start anything but I got a phone call today from my friend that said there's a rumor that people are coming here from headquarters. - From New York? - Right. - That's all I got, that's all I got. - It's a periodic evaluation, I'm sure. - We gotta prepare. - Well, right, we gotta-- - Is there anything that I should know about in each one of your departments, in each one of your situations-- - Everything's fine. - In your lives. - Everything's copacetic. - You know, I've been to some affiliates where there's, like, things going on where things are hidden, I'm just saying. - Yeah, that's not the kind of place we're running so we're just gonna have a discussion-- - Look, I didn't wanna make anybody paranoid but it just doesn't sound good, it doesn't feel good. - Angela, is there something else you wanna tell us? - The rumor was that they are coming tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - And what do we do tomorrow that's-- - You know, this is enough for me. I got enough shit going on in my life. - What's going on? - I don't need to-- - What's going on? - What's the problem, Mack? - Oh, um, Carson and I got in a little blowout last night and she, she left me. - What? - Mom, why have you come to stay with me and why did you leave Mack? - I'm leaving Mack because Mack left me 'cause he couldn't stand seeing who I really am. - She's lost her mind, she's been like that for months. She's been hysterical and ranting and raving, and I never know what the hell I'm gonna get. She's mercurial. - Who I really am when I'm not the happy person all the time and the hot person and the up person and the person who can just take care of everything. - She's accusing me of fucking around on her. - Oh my god. - No matter what I say, I cannot assure her that that isn't happening, and she took off. - I don't cheat, he does. - He cheats. He cheats. - He does. - You're convinced he does, I'm convinced he doesn't. - I think I chose a man just like our father. - She's like living with Jekyll and Hyde. - The only thing I know is somebody's good looking, who's got the world by the tail and can get anything he wants. - Sit down and talk to her, Mack, just-- - I've sat down and talked, believe me, oh, my god. - Where'd she go? - She went to Moxie's. - Moxie? - Moxie is my-- - Your daughter? - Oh, my god. So Moxie must be really upset. - It's my stepdaughter, her daughter. (laid-back music) ♪ Pick yourself up ♪ ♪ Take a deep breath ♪ ♪ Let's just eff off and start all over again ♪ ♪ Nothing's impossible, I have found ♪ ♪ For when my chin is on the ground ♪ - [Moxie] No, wait, no, wait, wait. - What, we're going to bed now? - No. - Want me to back away? - No, no. - What? What? - I haven't gotten my period. - What, right now you're gonna bring this up? - Well, I think we should, I think we should talk about it. - Oh, God. - Haven't gotten it. Wait, it's the longest it's ever been. I mean, I always get it on time. - Moxie, Moxie, I'm sure it's not a big deal. - What? - It's not a big deal. - Moxie, you ready? - Ready! - And action! - Hi, kids, welcome to another episode of "Mrs. Goldenrod's Roundup," with your favorite doggie, Corndog! (laughing) Hi, Corndog! - Hi, Mrs. Goldenrod. - Ooh, how are you today? - I'm great, I just went to the dog groomer. - You look so nice, Corndog. (Moxie laughing) And today we have a special guest, Godfrey the Goose! - [Godfrey] Hi, guys, how are you? - Hi, Godfrey! - Hey, hey, what is that? - That's a goose. - What's a goose? - That is a dog? - What's a goose? PRODUCER: Camera three. - Are you a girl goose or a boy goose? - [Godfrey] I am a boy goose. - What am I supposed to do with it? - What would you like to do with it, Corndog? - I'd like to eat it! (Godfrey screaming) Stay here, goose, while I eat you! Oh, you're a good goose. - Get him, Corndog, get him! - That's a good one. (thudding) - [Producer] Cut! Are you okay? - I'm fine. - James, when you come in on that two-shot with Moxie and I in the beginning, just will you pitch the camera up a little higher, come into us because the lights are so hot, it just makes us look-- - I can do that. - Okay. - Hi, hon. - Hi. Hi. - What are you doing? - I'm, uh, looking at my cellphone. - I see that, but why are you not in makeup? You're not getting ready? - My vagina hurts. - You've got a show-- Come on, we don't need to talk about your vagina-- - My ovaries. - It's not appropriate here, is it? - Are swollen, I haven't gotten my period. - Okay, all right, I understand. - In a week and a half. - It's okay. - I am overdue. - Honey? - What? - Calm down. - I'm calm. Hey, I am calm, I am calmer than calm. (phone ringing) - You're very calm. You're beautiful. - It's my mom again. Talk to her. - Why are you crying? It's good to talk to your mom. Hello, hi. Carson, hi. What, I, um, something's wrong. Moxie's sleeping right now. She can't talk but she's cramping really bad. Do you have any advice? What? No, no, she's not sick, she's got, you know, it's the female thing, the female issues, you know. You're female. Yeah, yeah, it's really bad, it's out of control right now. I don't know what's going on but maybe, she's complaining. She's bloated, she hasn't had her period in a week and a half. - What, no. - I mean, I don't, I feel like I shouldn't even be talking to you about this stuff. - Invite her over for dinner. - No, don't be sorry, don't be sorry, don't be sorry. You know, listen, yeah, we should sit down and talk 'cause we don't have enough time together. - You. - We gotta have lunch. - You make, make. You make her dinner, you. - I'm trying to get to it, give me a second, okay? - Spaghetti. - Moxie, calm down, just calm down. - Make her dinner, make her dinner. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Carson. Things are really hectic here at the studio, but all I was saying is I would really love to have you come over and make dinner for you so we can discuss, we can discuss these emotions that seem to be running very high at the moment. I don't understand why-- - I don't wanna talk about my emotions, I want you to make her spaghetti. - Honey, please. - Please. - I know, I know, I know, but you know what? We're gonna set something, maybe tonight, what are you doing? - No. - No? Okay, or this week, this week at some point. - No, next, next. - We're gonna get together. Okay, bye, honey, bye bye. (phone beeping) (lighthearted music) - Doesn't make any sense. By the time we get back to the chateau, we're not gonna wanna go back. - I can't do the other meeting, no. He said after, we'll call you after we get back. - This may take longer than we expected. - Okay, we're heading in right now. Bye. Hi. - Hey, Doug Dengrove. - Doug, how are you? - Harry Rubinek. - Hi, Louie Hess. - Lou. - Hi. - How are you? We've heard so much about you, really. - Thank you. - Since we're here, let me show you the master control room. - Well, you know what, to be honest, I'm not much of a tech guy, but I would love to address the employees ASAP. - Um, okay. - Whatever you want, sure. - Yeah, that's. - Come on. - Fantastic. - How was the trip? - Great. - Yeah? - Wow, across the whole country. - Yeah, the flight was great, yeah, yeah. - I wish you guys would have given us some notice, we would've made a little presentation. - I like the element of surprise. - That's Terry. - Hi. - Terry. - Hi, welcome. - It's beautiful. - You'll find all the people over here. Why don't you tell 'em about it. - This is H&R right here. Our great staff. - It all happens from here, the numbers. - Why don't you take a look around. Introduce 'em, Louie. - Hi, guys. - Hi. - This is what makes it all work. - Hello, Charlie Moon, I'm from corporate office in New York, how are you? - Come this way. - Nice to meet you. - This is Julie, say hi, okay, let's go. Let me take you to the creative part of this place. - Our programming is down here. - Well, it all happens here, it starts, you know? The genesis of all the programming is right here, and you'll meet somebody who really is the heart and soul of it all, Sherry Baum. - Hi, Sherry, some friends from New York. - Oh, yes. - Charlie Moon. - Oh, yes. - Harry Rubinek. - How are you? - You're Charlie Moon? - Charlie Moon, hi, how's it going? - Great to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Welcome. - Thank you, thanks for having us. - It begins here. - It begins here, that's right. - Charlie Moon, corporate, how are you? - Good to meet you. - I love that color, that's a vibrant color. How, how are you, Charlie. - Harry. - This is Harry. - Nice to see you, nice to see you. - Good to meet you. - How are you, pleasure. - Are we having a good day? - Yes, we are. - Everyone, we have a visitor from New York. Please stand here, everyone, stand up! We have a visitor, he's going to speak to us, please. - Thank you, Sherry. Hi, guys, my name is Charlie Moon. Call me Charlie, please. This is my associate, Harry Rubinek. We're gonna be with you for a couple of days. As a parent company, we're always reviewing our satellite stations to see how we can help you run things more efficiently, more economically. Now, despite falling ratings, less-than-stellar earnings, and a really crappy economy, I am very optimistic about this station here because you've always held a very strong place in the earnings of the network, although maybe not so much in the last year, but then again, who has, right? Um, unfortunately, the severe downturn in the whole economy has forced us to make adjustments, that's nationwide. That's across the board, I don't think that's gonna be a surprise to anybody. Um, I'll know more over the next few days. That's about it, I think. - You wanna talk about-- - Oh, right, right, right. - The numbers if you want. - Yes, we have gotten some reports in New York about some bookkeeping issues, some financial discrepancies. I don't think it's gonna be a big deal. I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of it. That said, I wanna thank all of you for many years of excellent work and service to the company. It has not gone unnoticed by corporate in New York and most importantly, any ideas, comments, questions, concerns, please bring them to your superiors. I'm going to have one-on-one meetings with all the key executives in their office and if you see me walking around, you can ask me too, or Harry, and if anybody knows a good poker game while I'm in town, I'm game, all right. Thank you very much. - Great. (clapping) - Pleasure to meet you all. (all clapping) - [Harry] Thank you very much. - [Sherry] Thank you. Back to work, everyone. Let's go. - Can we get a coffee? I would love one, yeah. Thanks, guys. - Thank you, everyone. - At ease, okay. - Back to work. - Right this way, gentlemen. This is our top-rated show, "X Sports," this is Mack Riley. - Oh, hey. - Mick? Charlie. - Mack, Mack. - Harry Rubinek, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, this is my assistant, Lana. - Lana, Harry. How are you? - Hi, nice to meet you. - We can talk about this later, okay? - Okay. - Thanks. - What's the name of the show? - "Mack Riley's Extreme Sports." - These gentlemen are from corporate. They're here to have a look around today. - Yeah, welcome to our humble station. - So what's an extreme sport, what would you consider? - Well, there's-- - Hunting? - No, hunting's not an extreme, it can be but no, not. - You don't handle that kind of stuff. I would think hunting's the most extreme sport. - It can be if you're hunting with Dick Cheney. - (laughing) Yeah, right, exactly. - Skiing, surfing, hang gliding. - Skateboarding, stuff like that? - Skateboarding, yeah, anything with a board and gravity involved, yeah, sure. - All right, everybody ready, Thanksgiving rehearsal. And action. - Hi, kids, welcome to another episode of "Mrs. Goldenrod's Roundup," starring your favorite doggie, Corndog! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, kids, happy Thanksgiving! - Get down off that couch, Corndog, right now! - It's my catwalk, I mean dogwalk, hey, woo, hey, hey! - Corndog, how many times I gotta tell you, get down! - Mrs. Goldenrod, will you give me an itch? Just a little itch. - Corndoggy, Corndoggy, good dog. - Yes! - Corndog, good dog. Good dog. - Yes, yes, yes. - Now, Corndog, this week is Thanksgiving week. Do you know what Thanksgiving's all about? - Turkey, gravy. - Well, yes. - Mashed potatoes. - That's true. But Thanksgiving is also about giving thanks-- - Cut, all right. Take it again from turkey and Thanksgiving. - Okay. - What's this one called? - "Mrs. Goldenrod's Roundup." - Yeah, it's the most popular children's show in southern California. - Let me see the file. - I sometimes jump in there and perform. - You? - Yeah, I play the Cheeky Monkey. - Turkey, mashed potatoes! - Well, that's true, Corndog, but Thanksgiving is also about giving thanks to everything we have in our life. - It is kind of a cult hit among teenagers. - Ham hocks. - Ham hocks? - Stuffing! (growling) - Oh, those things too. Corndog, Corndog, slow down. - I love stuffing, I don't know about you guys but I know-- - Are you aware that it lost 6% of its viewership in the past four quarters? - (gasping) Put down my purse! - She's got the purse. - Put down my purse, Corndog. Bad dog, bad dog, drop that! (laughing) Bad! - She's on the couch. - Cut! - Who are the suits? - Hi. - Hi. - [Charlie] Hi, how are you? - Hi, I'm Moxie. - My name's Charlie, it's a pleasure. - Charlie? - Charlie. You have a new fan now. How are you, son? - Hey, how are you? - Morning, guys. - I'm Charlie, I'm from corporate office in New York. - Johnnie. - Johnnie. - Harry Rubinek, Johnnie, nice to meet you. - Johnnie. - What's doing? - Uh, just routing some files here, you know. - Rounding some files? - Routing. - Routing some files, do you know what that means? - He's the IP guy, I take it. - Uh. - [Charlie] What language is that? - Some of it's Chinese, most of it's Chinese. - [Charlie] Most of it's Chinese, hmm. Do you speak Chinese? - Yeah, I mean moderately. - How did you learn Chinese? - You know, in the technology business, it's kind of mandatory. - And what runs through this computer? Is it production stuff, is it content stuff, is it-- - Anything you want. - Account stuff? - All of the above. - Payroll, things like that, too? - Um, yeah, I could get that up for you. - Huh. - I mean, I'm not in charge of any of that, though, I'm just an intern. Can I help you guys with something? - We're just taking a tour of the office and we were curious what you were doing here. - Yeah, I'm looking around, we're learning what goes on here, you know? - Are you the high-ups? - You could say that. (chuckling) - Hey! - Hey, Rich. - How's it going? Good to see you. - You did Mrs. Goldenhair. - Mrs. Goldenrod. How's it going? - Good, good, you were wonderful. - Thank you so much. - You still got a little... - A little-- - Lipstick. - I've been doing it for three years and it takes forever to get that stuff off. - It's very funny. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - You know, this is one of the guys I report to, actually. - Really? You work on the show? - No, no, no, I report my IT stuff to Rich. - We do a bit of everything here and Johnnie's created-- - So you do the computer stuff here as well as act on the-- - I do a bit because I do a bit of editing so I know computers very well, and Johnnie's a whiz on the computers, he's great. - Yeah, that's what we were hearing. (lively electronic music) - Einstein never could accept quantum mechanics. He called it "spooky science at a distance" because it didn't follow all physical laws that we knew up to now. Two objects could exist in the same place at one time. One object could be in two places at the same time. Action on one object could influence the other. To Einstein, this was impossible, and he spent forever trying to refute it but he couldn't refute it and apparently-- - I have to ask you a question because I'm sure somebody out there just like me has questions. You say you can see atoms, how do you see them? - I don't see them. - I'm, like, I'm the manager of a baseball team, right? My job is to bring the team to the World Series and to do that, I'm gonna do whatever's necessary. If I have to go out and get a lefty ace, I'm gonna do it for my team, right? If Posada's hitting 40 and he can't get behind the plate anymore, I may try him at DH and if that doesn't work, he may have to retire, you know what I mean? - Who's hitting 40 at this table? - I'm not saying anybody's hitting 40. - You know, I just hate traditional sport. - No, no, you know what I mean. (Moxie laughing) You're a sports guy, right? - Yeah. - Posada's a Yankee. - We're a sports team. - You've lost me now, I don't know what you're talking about. - What I'm saying is, what's good for you is good for us, what's good for us is what's good for you. If you guys are thriving, we're thriving, you understand? - We seem to be very happy so-- - I mean, there may be things you guys need that you're not getting and the network can have the support-- - Wait, wait, wait, you're not talking about firing. - [Charlie] No. - Then you're saying that if you needed to switch players or change the batting order or bring-- - Yeah, change the batting order. - That sounds to me like something's gonna happen. - No, no, no, look, look-- - Guys, guys, can we keep this PC here because, you know, at the end of the day, we want to make these guys our friends, right, we don't want to attack 'em. - No, I'm really don't-- - That's why we're sitting down having dinner. (everyone talking at once) - All due respect. - Really, what can we do to help you? - I think what we need to know-- - Is there things that have been neglected? Are there things that you feel that corporate in New York-- - We could use bigger budgets. - Hasn't been giving you enough attention in certain departments. - Wait, wait a minute, wait-- - Bigger budgets. - We could all use bigger budgets, my friend. - Better sets. - We have to, we have to-- - Can I please speak for a minute? - We're talking job security. - That's what we want, we want to get the insider's view, you know, an insider's perspective on what's going on and that would help. - You know what, at the end of the day, I wanna know after you guys leave in five days, who's not going to be here. - Okay, Louie, Louie! - Yes? - This is why talent should not be brought into these meetings right now because-- - Because I'm asking? - Talent has a tendency towards emotion and theatrics. (all talking at once) - Okay, I have had enough. This talent has two degrees. Also, graduated as valedictorian from her college! And you sit here having read some stupid being an executive bullshit. - We're not the enemy, guys. - My tits hurt and I'm getting my period! No, Ange, let's go! Ange, come with me, I'm out of here, this is bullshit! This is bullshit, charts and bullshit! - Now, this is why I was saying it's not wise to bring talent into executive meetings. - Oh my god. - That's not about that, it's that time of the month. - We all fall victim to grade-school theatrics and ridiculous emotions. (all talking at once) - This should be done at another time. This should be done, it's not about talent. This should be done another time, not when we're supposed to be eating. (crickets chirping) - I don't understand why you peeled all those, because-- - Because it tastes better, it cooks better. (all talking at once) (phone ringing) - It's Polynesian, it's Polynesian. - Hello? - Moxie, Charlie Moon. - Charlie. Hey, hey, hey, work, work, shh. Hey, Charlie, um, what's up? - I just wanna make sure you got home okay. It's a New York thing. - Yeah, I'm fine, if you can call it that, I guess, yeah. - Listen, I don't like getting off on the wrong foot with anybody, especially talent. - Oh, well. (scoffing) Don't sweat it, New York, I'm fine. - Oh, Jesus, you're one of those. - Is this an apology phone call or what? I'm not getting it. - An apology? Um, I don't really know what I'd be apologizing for, but if you want one, what can I do to make it up to you? - Well, what are you doing right now? - I'm going back to my hotel. - Where are you staying at? - Chateau Marmont. - Oh, that's, like, five minutes away. - Come over? - I think that would be very educational for you. - (laughing) I think I have had enough education for one night. - Just trust me, it's 5471 1/2 North Crescent Heights. Can you find that? - I'll put it in my GPS, I'll be over there in a little bit. - Okay. - Okay, all right, bye. - See you then, bye. - What's going on? - Who's that? - [Moxie] Okay, it's hung up. - Okay, who is that? - What's going on? - It's, it's, it's. (sighing) - Are you hooking up with-- - Do you like him? - No! Benny is my boyfriend. - Oh, please, you can do better than Benny. - Stop it, stop it, stop it. - Oh, come on. - No, there's this guy from New York and I'm just-- - Is he cute? - From New York? - He's not, no! - He's coming here? - Yeah. - Do we have to get dressed? - No. - Do we have to hide? - I want him to see you putting bananas on chicken. Be yourselves, so be yourselves. Have some more wine. - What's his name? - Who is he? - Cheers yourselves. - What's his name? - I want you guys to drink a little more wine and celebrate. (crickets chirping) (knocking) (woman laughing) - [Charlie] Hello? - Come in! - Oh, my god. - How are you? - We're great, we're just-- - Do you want some wine? - Yeah, get him some wine. - Sure, I'll have some wine. - This is Charlie. - Hi, Charlie. - Hi, Charlie. - This is my lovely Aunt Rita. - Aunt Rita. - Charlie, sit down. - But you may call me Rita. - Make yourself at home. - This is my mommy. - Oh! - Carson, here's some wine. - This is Mrs. Moxie. - Hi. - How are you? Now I can see where the good looks come from. - This is Mommy Moxie. - [Moxie] This is Auntie Lulu. - Aunt Lulu. - Hi. - Pleasure. - Hello. - Charlie. - Your daughter's a real firecracker. Did you know she was going to become one when you named her Moxie? - Well, that was, you know, she was supposed to be a boy and her name was Maxie. - Maxie. - She was such a firecracker that everybody called her Moxie and it stuck. - How are you feeling, Mommy? - Great name. - Mommy, what's going on? - What's wrong? (Carson laughing) - Mommy, what are you feeling? Mommy, what are you feeling right now? - What am I feeling? I'm feeling quite wet. (laughing) - Is that a hot flash? How does the hot flash-- - Why do you always rub food on your body? We have to eat that! - It's cold, honey. - You did this with the turkey. - Why are you bringing up meat, you know it's upsetting. - Oh, God, would you stop being such a diva! Why are you such a diva? I don't care if you have your own beliefs but you don't have to inflict them on us! (all talking at once) And it tastes really good. Very soft! - If I let these thoughts come to me, I'm gonna fall apart. - Would you stop? - All I need you to do is face reality-- - Oh, God, let me get my little guitar. - No, it's not like that at all and you're my sister! - Stop. (all talking over each other) - (screaming) I can't stand it anymore! - Oh, God! - I'm sorry if I'm intruding or something. - No, you're not. - Maybe I should, should I go? - Oh, my god, see? Nobody wants you to really be your real self. - Look at what you did to her. - Stop lecturing me, what? - You always do this to her. - I do this to her? - She's running off screaming. - Are you kidding me, that's what I was trying to say. I'm so sorry. - We're not always like this. (mellow music) - Sorry for all the craziness in there. - Why are you sorry? I liked them. (Moxie laughing) I did, I felt surprisingly comfortable around them. They're pretty funny though. - Yeah, they are funny. You saw what's going on in there. This is going on all over the country, the world. It's going on in our station, I mean, women of a certain age, a lot of women in our station talk to me about it all the time, they're going through varying degrees of this and I need a chance to pitch this to the senior execs. Nobody's making a documentary about it. I mean, I don't even have to leave the station to make this documentary. I can just make it in the station itself and if I can just pitch it to the top execs tomorrow, if you just give me the go, give me the green light, I-- - You want me to allow you to pitch it to the execs-- - Yes, yes, yes, you stay neutral. - Ah, okay. - You can stay neutral and then-- - So now you're asking something of me? - I need a chance to sell this. - You need me to give you the chance. - Please. - Well, I have a little problem with that. - What? - I'm very attracted to you, so if I do give you that opportunity, then maybe from a certain perspective, you know what I mean? There might be a certain motivation behind it. I might be using my position to benefit myself and give myself a better shot. - Sorry. Work, work, work, work. - Yeah, yeah. - Sorry, work, sorry. - Okay, you got a deal. - Sorry. - But I'm neutral. - Right. - Right. - I like your neutrality. - Yeah. - I really-- - Get busy. - [Moxie] I will. - I want a whole presentation tomorrow, okay? - Okay. - Audio, visual. - Okay, I even have PowerPoint if you want it. - PowerPoint, I want it all. Dog-and-pony show, right? - Okay. (upbeat music) (all talking at once) - Excuse me, folks, can I have your attention, please? Hello! Thank you. Our friend Moxie has been working on an idea. She's been putting her brain to it and I'd appreciate it if we all give her our full attention. - Thank you. Well... (clearing throat) In the last four years, this station has taken $5 million from broadcasting and I think that in the last three days, I have discovered from my mother and my aunts how to get over that hump and I wanna show you guys why. It's the biggest hush-hush topic that has not been covered in the American culture, I think in the world pretty much but never on television, never on talk shows, and so I give you "The M Word." ("The Battle Hymn of the Republic") - I don't like the way it feels. - You know what, I am so tired of you guys! - They look disgusting! - The degree to which I am angry is so out of whack. - Would you stop? - All I need you to do is face reality-- - Oh, God, let me get my little guitar. - All of a sudden, the insides start raging and the insides become bigger than the outside and I don't know how to deal with it. I feel like a crazy person. (screaming) I can't stand it anymore! - Oh, God! - These aren't actors? - No, no, family. Just family. - It's unfair because men don't go through it. (Harry chuckling) - That's my mother. - Women do and we get cellulite on top of it. It's not fair. - And those are my aunts. - I can't help it, sometimes this is who I am. - And they are in my house. - Turn that fucking television off! - My mind is gone, who are you? (taunting) - Oh, my god. - It's a change of life but once you get through the emotional part of it, you become wiser. You don't give a shit anymore. My freakin' husband, that motherfucking husband! That fucking control freak. They throw the women out as soon as they hit menopause and they go for somebody younger. - It's all real material. - Right now I'm freezing, five minutes ago we were sweating. (laughing) - It is funny but it is tragic. Oh, no, Mom, who do you get angry at? - God, or somebody, it's like what is going on? - This is not normal behavior for them. - I can't remember the names of people who are close to me. Mack! Mack? I can't even remember what I'm saying right now. I forgot his name. (laughing) - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just-- - We are more who we are now than we ever were. - [Harry] Wow, really? - We're not through the woods yet and we may be burning up inside but nobody's committing us to institutions anymore. They have to deal with us because we're a force to be reckoned with. - Yeah, this is something. - All right, so there's just a taste for you guys. That is a little trailer I put together. People out there are gonna be hungry for this and if we can be the first to get it out there, this is just one household. Imagine, we can profit, if we go out to every household out there, we get the reality of the situation, of menopause, we get dialogue started between husbands and wives, between mothers and daughters. I mean, my mother never talked to me about it. She just came over to my house the other night and said she wasn't getting along with my stepdad. I mean, no offense, but, you know, it's because-- - TMI, a little too much information. - It's not, though, it's because there hasn't been communication between you two because there's no information accessible out there-- - [Mack] Okay, we'll talk about that another time. - There's no information, why wouldn't we start dialogue about this, to share, to make people open up. This is a beautiful thing that we would be doing. - One question, if nobody knows about this, right? It's, it's, how do you sell it? - No, everybody knows about it. - Everybody knows about it. Nobody talks about it. - Moxie, Moxie. Do you mind stepping outside for a few minutes? - Okay, but, I mean, I can, but can I answer this question? I mean, the way that you sell it is you call it "The M Word." You call it menopause, you call it-- - Louie, Louie, we need to talk, please. - But there's a not-- - Give us a minute, please. - Sorry, I know, I know. - [Angela] I think it's fantastic, honey. - We'll call you back in. - It's fantastic. - But this is money, this is real money. This is real-- - Good job, Moxie, good job. (cheering) Good work! - Moxie! - Okay, what do we think? - It's fantastic! - What do you mean, "What do we think?" What do you think? It's absurd! - No, it's not absurd! - This is the worst fucking idea I've ever heard. - You're so wrong, listen, where else-- - Reminds me of dinner the other night but I don't see it as a TV show. - No, no, no, I see it-- - Sherry. - Where else do you get something like this? This is so-- - Leave it there! - Everyone wants to confide in this-- - Where are you-- - Everyone wants to confide in Moxie. She's amazing, she's like a combination between Ellen and Oprah. - I love her to death, I love her to death. - She's a sweetheart. That has nothing to do this having a place in television. - Guys, okay. If we're gonna talk on top of each other, we're not gonna know what each of us thinks. Harry has something to say. - Listen, I just wanna say that a niche programming for adults like this might just be what this station needs to get the ratings back up, okay, no, no, wait a second. It's all niche right now, okay? It's not 20-year-olds anymore. Since Oprah, the whole ballgame has changed and all the statistics right now are showing that the best market to take advantage of right now is the 40, 50-year-old market. Okay, you need something like this. - Angela. - Menopause is not only in America, all right? This is universal, it's worldly. - That's true. - This expands to everything. Think of the sponsors, think of the sponsors, doctors. - Harry's right, the demographics move up every year in age, we don't have the content to satisfy these audiences, only reality TV. - Guys, the point-- - I wanna make the show. - [Louie] You wanna make the show, there you go. - [Angela] I agree, right there. - I wanna make the show. Corporate in New York-- - Does Moxie not have an amazing gift? Does she not have an amazing gift? - All right, let me say this. This is a little close to home. It's a little bit, you know, invasive, for me but I'm living with it all day, every day, and if a show like this can come along and it can make men like me understand a little better what's going on with these women, then I say we should go ahead and do it. I say it's worthwhile and I think women will relate to it on a million levels. (all talking at once) - We're going ahead with this show. We need somebody to co-produce it with her, somebody who has some has some documentary experience. - Benny. - Benny. - What, me, are you serious? - You're the guy. - (scoffing) Are you joking? - I'm not joking, you're gonna co-produce with Moxie. - Why me? - Why you? I've seen your work, it's dynamite. - Thank you, I-- - You're great on location. You're great with remote, you're-- - I very much appreciate that but I couldn't be the furthest choice from the right guy for this project. - I think you have experience. - I have nothing. - You've got documentary experience, you're the guy. - Listen, with all due respect, I don't get it, okay, I-- - With all due respect, this is not a request, okay? Either you do it or you can have your severance. I've seen your contract, you'll be on immediate suspension. - Really, it's like that? Okay, all right, listen. - That said. - Whatever you need. - I want this-- - Whatever you need, whatever you need. - Okay, this I what I need. I need it to appeal to a lot of different people. Not just older women, it should appeal to husbands, boyfriends, adult children, you understand? It's gotta encompass much more than just the women. - How am I supposed to produce something I got no heart for, that's what I'm asking you, I have no heart for it. - I have a lot of faith in you, my friend. Moxie! - Appreciate that. "The M Word" is a green light. (laughing) (clapping) - Yeah, baby. - Thank you. - Benny will be co-producing with you. I'm gonna start you on a very low budget, you know, you're gonna have to cut corners and make it work on the fly. - Wait a second, Benny? - Benny's gonna be your co-producer, he's got-- - Benny can't do a show on menopause. (laughing) - I'm your new partner, we're excited. - He says, "Jesus Christ" every time I say menopause. He can't do a show on menopause. - We need a man to balance it out. - Why? - [Charlie] He's got documentary experience. - But he can't-- - You're the imagination. - He has no female exper-- - He's the nuts and bolts. - Moxie, I'm here for you, okay? - I have a vision for this. - He won't even come around the house when I have my period, okay? - Well, he's gonna have to because he's gonna be getting paid to do it. - Honestly, Moxie. I can't think of anything I'd rather talk about less than menopause. - Well, technically, I'm in perimenopause as well. I still get my period and instead of like, some women get their period less often and then they skip a month and then they skip two months, I'm getting my period every three weeks. - I'm a monster, I scare myself, I don't know who I am and I can't control it. - Right now, I'm trying to balance estrogen and progesterone and testosterone, which I didn't even know I had. - My PMS is way worse than it used to be, so every two weeks, I'm feeling PMSy so I'm prickly and irritable and just bloaty and craving chocolate, chocolate, anything chocolate. - I don't wanna get old, I don't wanna get older. I wish I could just stop right now. - Menopause is affecting the whole change in my life and the redefining of myself and I feel very trapped. - The only single reason Duncan had to die in "Macbeth" was because Lady Macbeth was going through menopause. (laughing) For real. - It's pretty much as we suspected, yeah, major stagnation, but there's three shows that have to go, no doubt, and, yeah, I'm dealing with it. Uh-huh, but there is one young woman, an actress, producer, very bright, very talented and I think she's got a lot of potential so I'm... No. I'm dealing with her about a future project that seems like it could be very profitable for this channel. - What does it feel like, how you feel inside? - To me, it's like an ending of the life that I knew. I used to love flaunting my body. I used to love always being looked at by men. - I worry what if I'm not as moist as I always used to be? And how does that affect, and I still feel like I am but I don't know if that's gonna last. - I just can't believe that this is my girl talk now. - You notice women in their 50s, 60s going to yoga. Everyone's trying to find their spirituality. - I definitely dread and fear menopause. I mean, they say it's, like, 100 times worse than PMS and I can barely get through PMS each month. - I will not miss my period, never. (strumming ukulele) - [Moxie] Hey, J. - Hey, Moxie. - You're getting good at that. - Practicing, don't tell anybody else, supposed to be working. - I promise you. So, you've known me for a little bit, right? - Yeah. - We're doing guy-to-guy thing. - We're homes. - We're homes, homies. Um, okay, so what do you think of Charlie? - Mr. Moon? - Mr. Moon, yeah. - (laughing) Shut up. - 'Cause, you know, he asked me out to go to coffee. - Oh, he did? - I know it's like a workday. - Oh, oh! - No, shut up, shut up. - Oh, Moxie! - Shut up, shut up, shut up. - Charlie! - Shut up, that's not cool, that's so not cool. - I know, sorry. - Come on. - Sorry. = He's asked me to go to coffee, it's like a work thing, but, you know, I can't talk to any of the other guys here 'cause they're gonna be stupid about it and I just wanna know what you think of, like. - I mean if you're asking me if I think he's attractive, I can't really-- - No, I don't want you to say if he's attractive. I just want, ou tell me what you think of him. - The truth? - Mm-hmm. - He seemed a little fishy. - [Charlie] I just want you to know I'm going out on a limb for you, all right? And there's a price you have to pay for that. (Moxie laughing) - Look. - You understand that, right? - Charles, you're very attractive, I'm not-- - I don't mean that, I don't mean that. You think I'm a sleazebag, don't you? - Little bit. - No, no, no, no, I'm not telling New York about the menopause thing. - Why? - At least not now, because I don't want them starting to, you know, nose around and they might send somebody out here, okay, it's gonna be-- - Wait, is there something illegitimate about doing that? - No, no, no, no, I just don't want them to start putting their fingers in the pie. You're gonna be responsible for it. You're gonna have hardly any budget, which is one of the attractive things about it, but... - I don't mind. - It's all on your shoulders, okay? - Okay. - I have nothing to do with it, my name's not on it. Nobody knows I've even been near it, you understand? So if it doesn't work, you take the fall. You understand, I'm a gambler who likes to cover his-- - But if it does work. - If it does work, if you win, I win, you understand, and if you win, I want two more shows, okay? Women's stuff, new stuff, different stuff. You understand? - Yeah. - Is that a deal? - Deal. - [Charlie] Charles Robert Moneta Jr., pleasure to meet you. - Moneta? - Moneta. - Moneta. - Mm-hmm. You like that? - Moneta is very hot. - It's hot, isn't it? - That's very sexy, why'd you change it? - I didn't change it. - Who changed it? - Well-- - You don't know? - No, in school that's what they started to call me, Charlie Moon, Moonie, Moon, kinda, you know, and then I got my first job. - Can we go for a walk? - A walk, what do you think I am? - Let's go, come on, let's go. - All right, come on. - What are you thinking? - What's the deal with Benny? - Benny? - Yeah. Honestly. - Benny is, honestly? - Yeah. - As long as he fits into my schedule and I don't mind who else, what's going on-- - So it's a thing of convenience. - Yeah, my thing is my career. I don't know, there's not, I don't, why are you asking me? - Why do you think I'm asking you, 'cause-- I don't know. - I have a vested interest in the answer to this question. - A vested interest? - Yes, now I do. - How much of a vested interest? - You know, I don't want to be, you know, I don't wanna be led on, you know what I mean? - Oh. - You understand, right? I'm not that kind of girl. - I wasn't leading you on. - You understand? - I know, I'm sorry if it hurt before. ♪ Our summer day ♪ ♪ Withers away ♪ ♪ Too soon ♪ ♪ Too soon ♪ ♪ Speak low ♪ ♪ When you speak low ♪ ♪ A moment is swift ♪ ♪ Like ships adrift ♪ ♪ We're swept apart ♪ ♪ Too soon ♪ - So what do you want? - This right now, this. Being with you in this place. - Just now? For 72 hours? - Looking at the sunset. - For 72 hours? - I don't know if it's gonna be 72 hours. I don't wanna think about that, you know what? The future doesn't exist, the past is gone. All we have is now, right, so why not, like, keep it? - 'Cause I don't want that anymore in my life. - What, the now, what do-- - I don't want the "let's just hang out now" thing. I don't want that. I don't want it with you, I feel too much here. I feel way too much. - You feel too much? You really feel that? - And if you don't at least-- - I didn't say I don't. - At least-- - You know I feel something. You know I feel a lot, you know I feel the magic, the spark. - I don't feel a spark, I feel a fucking inferno here. ♪ Tomorrow is here ♪ ♪ And always too soon ♪ - I'm not afraid of the menopause at all. I'm totally embracing it, I think I'm having a hot flash right now. (laughing) But I, am I sweating, yeah. - What I'm really afraid of is not the physical thing, the hot flashes and all of that but the hereditary, psychological components where I will wanna be on my own and not with men and I really, really don't wanna turn into my mother. - But I was so sad because Aunt Flo, I call her, and she, I loved her. (laughing) With her suitcases and with her, all of her luggage, whether it was, however she came, I loved her, and then she left and it was really sad. - Can we talk about sex, is it okay to talk about sex? Okay. (laughing) Well, so, for the past four years, and I mean four full years, I've had no interest whatsoever in sex, none, okay? I mean, it's so bad that Alec Baldwin and George Clooney, they still show up in my dreams but now we just chat. (women laughing) Seriously. - I feel like I'm Harold Lloyd, you know, on the big face clock, like, desperately holding on. - I'm just reaching the end of the tunnel and I can see no way of getting out of it. - It's a process of dying, we're getting closer to dying and that's the horrifying fact of the whole thing. - [Woman] I feel more alive than I've ever felt. - The dawn is, what is it? There's the light, before it's dark, it's the lightest. - [Woman] Dawn is before the dark? - Bingo. - So what can I do for you, Benny? - What can I do for you? I think that's what we're talking about here. How can I best serve you, because I know that you're not just here to bust balls, you're here to make choices and they're hard choices. I wanna help you make those choices. - Who told you I'm here to make choices? - Come on, it's not my first day at the ballpark. You know what I mean, you come down here. You gotta make decisions. I've been running the numbers and I put together a file full of all the research that I've been doing. I'm trying to help you out so you have bird's eye view of everything at the station. - What kind of research were you doing? - I've been doing TV Qs, I've been looking where our highest profit shares are, our audience base-- - I have all those numbers already. I got those numbers before I even got out here. - What you don't have is you don't have the personal hands-on effect with each person. You don't have your finger on the pulse of what's happening here-- - And you do? - Absolutely. I'm here day in and day out, this is my life. - Could you set up through the computer system here a way of monitoring what people do on their individual terminals here? - We're talking about-- - Hacking into their-- - Not hacking, I don't wanna get into what they do when they're home or on their personal time, but what goes on at work-- - But, wait, are you talking about looking into people's business online or are you talking about physically monitoring the building? - I wanna see how things are dealt with on a day-to-day basis in terms of accounts, in terms of revenue, in terms of flow, flow charts and all those things. - Well, look, if you wanna set up a monitoring system throughout the company, every time somebody logs onto the internet, we could monitor what they're doing, whether it is watching porn or stealing money-- - Now, why don't we have that in place already? - I could set up anything you want on here. If it's on these computers, we'll find out whatever it may be. - Listen, let's keep this between the three of us. - Holy crap, this just gave me an unbelievable idea. We wire up a couple web cams, all right? Wire up just a few, we can test it through any remote location to link the viewer to the content, the content to the viewer-- - But I don't want any viewers-- - No, I know, we're gonna give you what you want. We're gonna give you what you want. - Charlie, you know every journey of a thousand miles begins with one step, Mr. Moon. - That's true, very true. (energetic music) (birds chirping) - [Rich] So you're telling me we can look anywhere in the studio we want? - That's the beauty of it. - Anywhere? - Anywhere. I could put 'em in the bathroom if you really want to. - No, don't do that, that's crazy. Did you put it in the studio? - Uh, yeah, yeah. - When we shot a show? - Yeah. - Do you have me doing Mrs. Goldenrod? - I think so, unfortunately - Really? You show Moxie any of this stuff? - No, no, no, not yet. - So she has no idea? Crenshaw, all the kids out there are looking forward to your appearance here on the show and, please, say hello to them. - Go ahead, Crenshaw, say hello. - You kids see a crab in the ocean, I want you to make sure you leave that crab alone, you don't touch him. You don't look at him, you don't even bother him, except maybe to throw a potato chip his way 'cause, listen, that crab is probably doing something fun. He's just trying to get some sun or he's just trying to check out another crab but it's none of your business what that crab's doing with his life. - Now-- - Like this chick here had no business catching me. - But I had a net and so I scooped her up. - I'm sorry to put you in this position, but you're in charge here. - What's the big megillah? - It's a really big megillah, unfortunately. It's King Kong, there is a huge amount of money missing from the accounts, there's been embezzlement at this station. - Do you know-- You have a number? - This much. - Big, big money. - Yeah. - Okay. - This much. - Um. You know, I'm going to come around and say it. What are we gonna do? What do you suggest we do? How do we put an end to this? - [Doug] Uh, well... (chuckling) - Somebody's gonna have to take the fall and I don't want it to be you. - We've gotta be proactive. Each one of you has a department and you have a lot of people in it and you're familiar with these people. I want you to see if there's anything suspicious going on. - How many of us could be the person? How many? - [Doug] One? - Here's four. - What are you thinking? - How do we know there's even a person? How do we know there's even a person? These guys come in here, they interrogate the whole group, they make accusations out of the blue, do you what they-- - [Sherry] Look, I think that we have to stay calm. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, let me say this. - The fact is, money is missing. - I know it was upsetting. - You know the other night, you and I were over here in the meeting, we both had scotch, right? We both had a little glass of scotch, we do this-- - What does that have to do with it? (laughing) - Because I got accosted by this Charlie Moon-- - Oh, no. - Telling me that he was concerned that I got some kind of problem with alcohol. - Oh, come on. - It came to our attention that you had gone for help, for rehabilitation, what was the place? Sandy Pines. Was that it, Sandy Pines? - Yeah, that was the name of it. And how long, was it a, I'm assuming it was not successful, the treatment. - I think it was very successful. I'm doing fine. I'm doing fine. - But it happened to me too. - Heads are gonna roll. - Well, they should roll if somebody's taking money. - I know none of you guys have done this. - Is there anybody else but those of us on the team that could have done this? - We can't imagine. - That had access? - We can't imagine who did this. - There's cover-ups. I don't want you to be dragged into that. Now, what I'm gonna ask you very honestly is, what shell should we be looking under? - Oh, I can't, I don't know of any shells, honey, that you should be looking under, really. I have no clue what's going on. - I've only been here eight months and I'm trying to just keep my nose clean. - You know, you guys have been here and it's been putting us a little on edge. - Who in this organization here are you concerned about, if you know what I mean? - Well, I would say the younger women, anybody's who's younger, not going through menopause, doesn't have children. - Have you ever been approached by a sponsor with the offer of a kickback? - I check copy, I'm a writer, so I'm copywriter. - [Harry] A copywriter. - How long have you worked here? - I'm in recovery, so I'm completely sober now. - Money's been embezzled, it's not just missing. You know what I mean? - And what, what could I possibly know? I don't touch the money, you know that. - And you're the production intern and your specialty is? - Information technology. - Information technology, and that has to do mainly with computers, correct? - Yeah. - Is there something you need to tell us? - Is there something you need to hear? - I'm asking for your help, someone who has a perspective of two different vantage points, creative, in front of the camera, behind the camera, behind the computer. - You're suggesting that would be me as someone? I play a woman-- - Brilliantly. - Thank you, Mr. Moon, but the reality is I'm a 44-year-old actor. - Um, unfortunately, with what's going on, the research that Harry's been doing, I don't know if you'll be on the air next week. - Did he ask you anything about the business or anything like that? - No, no, he was just asking me these abstract, intellectual questions. - And that was your conversation? - That's right. - I saw you talking to him. - Why are you so interested? Well, you're talking to me, you know, you're talking about space. - I wouldn't talk about those subjects to you. It would be kind of pointless. - Well. - If you knew of something was going on around here that was maybe shady, who would you talk to? - I feel like you want me to say you. - I would like to think that if there was something going on that was a little unscrupulous, that you would feel that you had a comfort zone, that you could come talk to me and you'd be okay. - Sure. What if you heard something unscrupulous, so to speak, I mean, would you come to me? - I would like to think that I could trust you, yeah. - So come to me, what have you heard? - Can you give me a minute? - [Harry] Absolutely. - We're good here as far as the other thing goes. Don't worry. - Okay. - Okay, what's wrong? What is it, are you mad at me? - What are you doing? - What? - What is all this? This is like a crazy dog-and-pony show on acid. - It's not a dog-and-pony show - You two are like little kindergartners running around. - Something is going on. We're not kindergartners, something's going on here and we're trying to get to the bottom of it. And you don't have any idea? - Hmm? - Mm-mm. - Leave it open. I don't like this, I don't like it closed like that? - Why? Why? - 'Cause I can't see your pretty mouth. - Why? - I wanna see it. - Well, it's time for us to sign off from KZAM and send Priscilla back to her cage in Cincinnati. - Oh, are we done? Shoot, I was just going to tell them where the bodies were buried. - Oh, oh, bodies? - Should I tell them where you buried the bodies? She hacked them up, she buried them up and fed them to the cougars. - Want a cracker? - I don't want a cracker. I wanna tell them where the bodies are. - We don't know what she's talking-- - I think it's time for this bird to go. - Clean up the blood, clean up the blood, Priscilla. Clean up the blood, Priscilla, clean up the blood, Priscilla. Clean it up, clean it up, Priscilla! Clean up the blood, Priscilla, it's a secret, it's a secret, it's a secret! - What's a secret? - Tax evasion, tax evasion! (chuckling) - My mother used to talk about the tonic with my aunts. They used to take the tonic, could have been scotch for all I know that they talking about. - My mother went from being what seemed like, I don't know, size 12 to, like, a size 18 and she really pride herself on her beauty. - My mother's mother and her aunts and her older sisters all told her to grin and bear it. - My mother left my father when she was 50 and going through it. - My own mother doesn't even know when she went through menopause, she doesn't have that to share with her daughters. - I said to my mother, "Did you go through." Like, "What happened when "you went through menopause?" She goes, "I got a little warm." - My mother always loved to cook, and then she got in this spell where she couldn't stand to be in the kitchen because it was hot all the time. - My mother kind of took a permanent pause from men. - My father, being a southern man, decided if his wife couldn't cook, he was going to get a divorce. - [Charlie] There she is. - Hi. - How are you? - What you doing here? Where is everybody? - Uh, I dismissed them. - You dismissed them? - I dismissed everybody because I wanted to have a word with you first. - But we're supposed to shoot the show now. - Yeah, well, um, you now have all your time to focus on the menopause documentary. By the way, I put out some feelers-- - I mean, I'm so excited about that. - No, yeah, I put out some feelers to some people I really trust, they think it's a really great idea. They got really excited about it and now I'm excited, so. - We're happy. - That's what I want you to focus your energy on. I had a whole Moxie film festival last night. - You did? - I watched six episodes. And you are brilliant. - I am not brilliant. - You're an extremely talented woman and you're a very great artist. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. - Really? - Absolutely. - That's very sweet. - That said, um, unfortunately, "Mrs. Goldenberg's Roundup" is one of the shows we're going to have to let go based on the surveys. It's got a small popular following but it's been steadily diminishing and the numbers just don't hold up anymore. - Mrs. Goldenrod. - Listen-- - It's not Mrs. Goldenberg. Uh, that's about nine jobs right there that you're just putting in the trash can. - That's an unfortunate thing, but that's reality. - That's reality? - The numbers are the numbers are the numbers, that's what I hear day and night. - But that's Richie's life. - That's Richie's life. But Richie's going to get another job, this is Hollywood. I'm sure there's tons of places he can go and work. - No, this is Hollywood, everybody's out of work here. Wait a minute. - If the numbers were supporting things, this show would run forever as far as I'm concerned. - Numbers, but what about-- - It's the numbers and the wallets that support those numbers. - No, wait, wait, wait, wait. - That's just how it is. That's how those decisions are made. - Just stop the numbers talk for a second, okay? Thee are my friends and I don't get the numbers thing. - The advertising dollars are based on the numbers. If you're an advertiser, right, you have a product. You want to sell this product, right? You want it on the highest level-- - My director has a son and a wife and my editor just got married and-- - Think about it this way, right? Now if your work on the documentary is successful. - Mm-hm. - That's going to lead to more options for you. You're gonna have control-- - I'm single, though, that's not fair. I mean, I'm happy about that. - See, there's nothing I can do, you know what I mean? - Between the estrogen and the testosterone, I have smoothed out so much. I really recommend it. - [Lulu] Is that for the rest of your life, I mean-- - You know, if it'll keep me sane, it is for the rest of my life and that's fine. - [Carson] Do you put it on top of the-- - No, you put it on a different one, like do it on this one-- - Guys, tea? - I did it on both. - Yeah, I'd love some tea. - Rich? - Honeybush, yeah. - Rich, you're not going home tonight. You're staying here. - You put it on the inside. - Does it matter where you-- - Yeah, it does, there are certain places. - Hi, sweetie. - Hey. - [Carson] Oh, thank you. - Wait, who else needs a-- - We're good. - This is the DHA, that's another one. - Mrs. Goldenrod's got axed today. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - No, Mom, I'm not standing for this. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. I'm cooking up something. - Cooking up something? - Yeah, I'm gonna do something, I have something. - What are you going to do? - I don't know yet. But I'm going to do it. - Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry. - Families, co-workers of mine, losing their jobs. Their kids going to school, it's. - It's happening all over the country. - Mediocrity. - Yeah, mediocrity. - You were so good. - Well, you don't have to worry too much, Moxie. You got your show. - What show? - What? - It's... My show got greenlit. - When? - Show about what? - And congratulations. - The menopause show. Rich, don't be sarcastic. - I'm not being sarcastic. - The menopause show! - You know-- - Mox, it's great, it's great. - There's a hint of bitterness in your voice. - Look, I'm bitter because I lost my job but truly, it's great. - This is terrible. This is... Rich, I don't, I don't. - I'll find another job, Moxie. (wheezing) - Rich, Rich, Rich, no, no, no. - He's having a panic attack. - Rich, Rich, no. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Easy, easy, easy. (breathing deeply) - [Carson] Lie down and have a blanket. - Yeah, yeah. - Right? Like going into shock kind of thing. - Mom, Mom? Do your breathing with him, do your-- - This is embarrassing, this is embarrassing. - No, stop judging yourself, stop judging yourself. - There's nothing to be embarrassed about. - Are you feeling any better? - Okay, Mom, Mom, do it. - Okay, okay. - Mom, do what? - She's doing her healing, yeah, just let her-- - No, not the shoes! - Shh. - Not the shoes. - Shh, just be quiet! - [Rita] We're not taking them off. - Just, Richie, be quiet. - Just breathe. - She's doing, she does reiki. - Just breathe. - Good, see? - [Rita] Close your eyes. - She's taking off, she's cutting things. - Hold his feet is good. - Close your eyes. - She's so good at this. - Let the negative energy, just go away. - She's getting rid of it. - Mom's pulling it, whoosh! Whoosh, whoosh! - Easy. (whooshing) - Okay. (Rich breathing deeply) - Just smooth it out. (breathing deeply) - [Rich] It's better, it's better. - [Producer] And in five, four, three, two. (energetic rock music) - Hello, folks, welcome to "Mack Riley's Extreme Sports." Tonight, I wanna tell you a little bit about a recent adventure I had down in Costa Rica. ♪ Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho ♪ ♪ Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho ♪ ♪ Yeah, that's the Woody Woodpecker song ♪ ♪ Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho ♪ ♪ Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho ♪ ♪ Yeah, he's a-peckin' it all day long ♪ ♪ He pecks a few holes in a tree to see ♪ ♪ If a redwood's really red ♪ ♪ And it's nothing to him on the tiniest whim ♪ ♪ To peck a few holes in your head ♪ ♪ Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho ♪ ♪ Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho ♪ ♪ That's the Woody Woodpecker's tune ♪ - Go through router six and router eight when you're ready. - I had no idea that you had blossomed into this woman. (woman chuckling) - Is that a cricket? What am I doing? - Come over here. - If the network's gonna fire me, they're going to get a few surprises. Just help me do this, okay? - Showtime. (crickets chirping) (Carson whistling) (ice rattling) - Hey. - How you doing? - I'm good. - Good. - Let me get out of here. - No, no, no, no, it's all right, it's all right. Stay here. Shh, shh, shh, shh, the girls are all sleeping. I can't sleep four in a bed. I'm gonna stay in here with you tonight. - Don't be silly, I'm-- - No, no, that's okay. - What are you talking about? - This is a big bed. - Carson, are you crazy? I'm gonna get on the couch if you're going to stay here. - Don't give me the couch, I wanna sleep here, it's okay. - You can't sleep here with me. - Why not, friends forever, c'mon. - Could I have a sip? - You wanna sip? (laughing) I make really good drinks. - I think you've had a little too much. - I know, and my feet are killing me. Can you take my boots off, please? - Take your boots off? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, I'll take your boots off and get you into bed. - Yeah, no, first of all, you unzip this right there. That's the first step. - Okay. (groaning) - Oh, yeah, release. - Okay, we're all here. We called this meeting today to go over a few things. We've been here for a few days now. We've come to some conclusions. We still have some questions, but it's safe to say some decisions have been made. First of all, we want to welcome Moxie as executive producer, she's gonna be on all the executive board meetings from now on. - [Sherry] Yay, Moxie. (clapping) - All right, way to go. - Thank you. - We are full steam ahead with "The M Word." - Thank you. - Going well, right? - Mm-hmm. - Good. Second on our list, "Extreme Sports." The show is hemorrhaging viewers. We think for the show to survive, we have to go with somebody younger as the face of "Extreme Sports." If we're going to keep the show on the air, we need a new face of the show. Mack, that means you can no longer host it. At the same time, you will maintain your position as executive producer. I think it's time for you to even focus more on that aspect of the show. - Wait a minute, wait, wait, what do you mean we're hemorrhaging viewers? - The, the, the last quarter, Mack, you lost 20% in the 18- to 35-year-old demographic. And that's very alarming to us and to New York. - You're getting rid of my show? - We're got getting rid of your show, Mack. We're gonna hire someone else to host it. - He came up with show, he is the show. - It's still your show, you're going to be executive producer, you're gonna design the segments, you're gonna choose the locations. I want you to chime in and help us out on picking someone to replace you. - The whole reason I've been successful for 30 years doing this show is because there are no other people who can stand in front of the camera and can also do the sports that he's talking about. - Exactly. - We're not convinced of that. - And, actually, Mack, you can help us work on that. - I'd like to hear from you who you think will be a good replacement. - [Moxie] Nobody. - It just comes from corporate. It's just demographics-- - Wait a minute! - I don't understand. What the hell, what are you talking about, replacing me? With who? - Mack-- - Yeah, who is going to replace him? - You're a ball player, which is what I consider you to be. - I can do it. - [Moxie] Benny! - I can do it. - Benny! - No, no, no, no, listen to me, listen to me. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, we're in the middle of a meeting here. What makes you think you can barge in, walk through the door, and chime in with your opinion? - Hold on, honey, hold on. - Go, go, go, go. What are you doing? What are you doing? - They need to hear the truth. - The truth? - Yes. - The truth? - The bottom line is I've been on the phone with these guys. - What guys, what guys? - The guys who are our sponsors. The guys who are our advertisers. What they wanna see is they wanna see-- - You? - They wanna see a younger host. - They wanna see-- - That's what they wanna see. Do you wanna see it go to some kid who's not even a part of this network? - Benny! - Or do you wanna see it stay within the family? Because I'm talking about an opportunity where we can revamp this. They don't give a shit about watching some old fart, with all due respect, doing this show-- - Do not call my stepfather an old fart. - Listen to me. - You know what, you don't even kill spiders. - You're making it personal. - I have to kill the spiders! - What the fuck does that have to do with sports? - If I have to kill the fucking spiders, you can't do a report-- - Is that sports? Is there a spider sport I'm unaware of? - No, no! - I'm with you. We're on the same page, what I wanna see is him protected, you protected, the whole family protected. I wanna see the network thrive. - How do you possibly think that you can take over an extreme sporting show? - Look at me, look at me, I'm in great shape. That's why! (lively music) - Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Everyone, would you mind standing up, please, and just gathering, coming closer? Yes, you people in the back, too, please, come forward if you will. Come forward, you in the back, yes, come forward, please. As you remember, I'm Harry Rubinek and Charlie Moon. I'm gonna read off a few names. I'd like you to raise your hand when I call your name, please, and afterwards, Charlie will explain to you what's going on. Number one, Karen Feegle. Very good, thank you. Number two, Dee Dee Sullivan. Thank you. Number three, Louise Kaloff? Thank you. Number four, Justine Frolly. Thank you very much, thank you. A few more names here, one moment, please. We have number five, Priscilla Sacks. Very good. Number six, Katie Summers. Thank you. Number seven, Michael Goodman. Thank you very much. And number eight, Pauline Reid. Thank you. And Jimmy Greegs. Okay, thank you, you can all put your hands down now. - Thank you, those of you whose names have just been mentioned, you will be receiving our Golden Plan package. Now, although that does mean early retirement at the end of this year, more importantly, it means a very, very generous benefit package, and that's going to kick in January 1st. The details of the package are going to be explained in a letter you're gonna be receiving sometime after Thanksgiving. This is not an easy decision. I wanna thank you all for your years of dedication and hard work here, and I think the package is really gonna help you to transition into a new phase of life. Like Shakespeare said, "All good things come to an end," but this ending has a new beginning on the other side of it, I think, so let's think about this as a new chapter. We're going to do whatever we can to help you with this transition, we-- - You are a shit! - Whoa, Moxie, careful. - You shit! - Moxie, careful. - What the hell is going on? (phone ringing) Sorry. - Um, well, again, this was a very difficult decision, ladies and gentlemen, very sorry, but there was no other way except to make these cuts and again, we will be around to discuss any difficulties or needs that you have, thank you very much. - It's all under control, trust me. - [Harry] Go back to work, thank you. - It's exactly what I told you. We made the necessary adjustments, we told the employees. - I'm so sorry. - Harry's talking to them, I've been talking to them. It's already going away because most of them know they're going to lose their jobs and they're scared. (all speaking indistinctly) - Wait a minute, I have the answer! I have the answer, it has to do with these! (all cheering) We will not be bullied or forced out! We will not, we're staying here. We are going to keep our jobs in this station. I want you to fight the corporation! I want you to fight for our little station! We're staying here! - Moxie! - We are not going anywhere! Woo! - What are you doing? - Fight for our rights! Fight for KZAM, fight for KZAM, fight for KZAM! Fight for KZAM, fight for KZAM! Fight for KZAM, fight for KZAM! Pass these down! Fight for KZAM! - What is this, Moxie, what's going on? - It's a lock-in. - [Charlie] Okay. (cheering) - It's a lock-in. - Anyone who does this, what she's saying, will join the others in early retirement, okay? You'll be out the door with everybody else. - Or, Charlie-- - One for all out the door. - Charlie, maybe you will land in early retirement. - You're gonna get your co-workers fired, Moxie, all right? - Maybe this time, you'l land in early retirement. Maybe it won't be us. (cheering) Fight this system and what this country has turned into. Stay here, lock yourselves down now! Lock yourselves down. - Those of you who stay are breaking the law. (cheering) Those of you who stay are breaking the law! - You are awesome! - Thank you. Lock yourselves together, lock yourselves together! - The police are going to be called and you'll all be arrested for trespassing! - [All] Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie! - Call the police. You're all gonna be arrested for trespassing! I want them out of this building. - [All] Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie! - You're gonna get 'em all fired. They'll all be out of a job. - You're a liar. - I'm not a liar. - You liar. - I'm doing my job, Moxie. - All of you, if you get on your Twitter accounts, you get on Facebook, you call up everybody at every station that we know, you get us on the news. You get everybody that you know to tweet their friends, to tell them that we are no longer-- - You better get them to post bail because you're all going to be in jail tonight. Oh, great, yeah, yeah. Okay, all these people have been fired and now I want them out of the building. They're trespassing, okay? (laughing) Now if you can't handle it, call the police and let's-- - Stay with us! - Come on. (all cheering) - Hey, he's one of us, come on. He's gonna come lock himself up with us, I'm sorry. (cheering) - [Charlie] Okay, let's get the fucking police here. - [Harry] This is not a joke, listen to me-- - Up yours, Charlie Moon, up yours. - [All] Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie! (all cheering) - You're all facing criminal charges! You are all facing criminal charges! (cheering) - [All] Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie! - [Woman] What's next? - All right, Sluski! Sluski, what can we do on the computer to get this out there? - We could, well, Tweet would be the better thing. Let's get our photos into-- - [All] Tweet, tweet, tweet! - Tweet, yes, let's get on it, let's all-- - They're gonna start tweeting. They can tweet, they can tweet. - Who has over 1,000 Facebook friends? - I do! - I do! (Doug laughing) - Pull out your cellphones. Everybody dial one contact right now. - Right now, dial two. - The highest contact you have. Ed Begley, you have a contact to Ed Begley. We need cellphones. - [Michael] Get them all. (lively music) - Ed, I really need your help because I know that you show up. You are a person who shows up. You are a man of honor and integrity and labor! (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - Unity, unity! It's time for a change! - Yes! - Okay, I've been authorized by my superiors to make some concessions, so... (handcuffs rattling) What can we do to end this madness? - Revoke all the firings that you did. - We're sitting here trying to negotiate terms. You can't just ask for a 100% of what you want. - Why? - I mean, negotiations don't work that way. - Why not? - I know you've never been in the situation before. You're usually doing a show in front of the camera dressed as a puppy dog, but this is the real world. You can't get everything you want. - No, it's funny, I've been in the workforce for quite some time now and I've never had these little two people come into some corporation that I worked for and-- - Moxie! - Fired everybody. - My job is hanging by a fucking thread! - Well, I'm sorry! - I was humiliated in front of my fucking boss. - How do you think those people who you fired felt when they had to raise their hands like they were-- - Three of those people are over 58 years old. They've been with this company over 25 years. It's time to move on. Everything has a shelf life, you understand? - That's sick, it's sick. - It's like bottles of milk, right? You gotta know when the expiration date. Some, they go bad a few days before, some you could drink a week after, but you gotta know when your time is up! (dramatic music) - [Announcer] Fox News once again shows the failure of the illegal strikers against the integrity of the American corporate system. (lively music) - I think we were at 30. - 30 is fair. - Because that could mean saving families, you know-- - I think you're being unrealistic. - How 'bout if I don't do my menopause show, then we can keep Deborah-- - We need your menopause show. - We can keep Deborah and she's a single mom. - See, but then you're keeping people for the sake of what-- - For feeding her kids! - Where are we gonna get ratings and how are we gonna get sponsors? We don't have things on the air-- - I want those people to be working. I quit, okay, I quit my job here, I do. - You can't quit. - I quit. - You can't quit because I need you. - I'm not staying here. What? - Come on. - No. - We'll keep 30 people. We'll keep 40 people. Come on, please. Be my Moxie, come on. (lively music) - [Man] Moxie? Moxie? Moxie? - Dad? - There was that kid in second grade and you came home one day and said he was bugging you. I told you that if it ever happens again to sock him. (laughing) You came home several days later and told me that you punched him in the stomach. - His name was Tommy. - Tommy. - He was a jerk. - [Dad] He was a jerk. - Yeah. - That's what a dad wants to hear, you know? That you're strong, that you can fight for yourself. When I came home from the war, met your mother and we had you, I was broken. Though I loved you more than anything I've ever known, I couldn't contaminate you with my pain. You suffered from my time in Vietnam just as though you'd been there by my side. I let you down in so many ways. I had no idea what had stricken me. All I know you is that you were the brightest spot, the brightest spot. ♪ Three, six, nine, the goose drank wine ♪ ♪ The monkey chewed tobacco on the street car line ♪ ♪ My mama told me if I was goody ♪ ♪ That she would buy me a rubber dolly ♪ ♪ My auntie told her I kissed a soldier ♪ ♪ Now she won't buy me a rubber dolly ♪ ♪ Three, six, nine the goose drank wine ♪ ♪ The monkey chewed tobacco on the street car line ♪ ♪ The line broke, the monkey got choked ♪ ♪ And they all went to heaven in a little row boat ♪ (laughing) - See? - What, see what? - You still have it in you, girl.

(dramatic music) - [Announcer] Breaking news this morning, KZAM TV backs down on dismissals. Sources say 40 jobs were saved when employee Moxie Landon led a revolt in which workers chained themselves to each other in response to a corporate downsizing by their New York parent affiliate. More news coming up. - I didn't know anything about menopause. - I didn't even know what the word menopause meant. - It's a metaphor for feeling like you're getting older as a woman. - You lose the elasticity of your skin. - It's so exciting on one hand and it's so depressing and it's so filled with anger. - You've dried up. - Being in places and wishing I had a fan on me, all the time. - So you're not worth anything, you're invisible. - There's no more pubic hair. - I'm not nice. - You want to have a baby, you don't want to have a baby. - Night sweats. - Mood swings. - Cramps. - Emotional issues. Memory loss. - Who am I all over again? - Hey, you're a woman, you know, you're revered for your sensitivity and your compassion and yet you're bombarded with sort of atrocities and horrible things and people discarding you and you're irrelevant and people putting you, and the rest of the world, they're in veils. - Freddie, Charlie Moon. I'm good, how are you? Excellent, excellent. I wanna revisit the conversation we had about your original content channel idea. I've met some people out here in L.A., they're talking apps, we're talking niche programming for older women, older adults, 40 to 65 and even beyond that. Like, exactly, Oprah Winfrey for the 21st century. (festive music) - Okay, so wait, am I inviting people in now? - No, give us a minute. - No, what? - Hi, how are you, wow, look at this. - See, great minds think alike. (all speaking indistinctly) - I didn't think I could wear yellow, who knew? (laughing) - What is this? - These are rolls. Mom, you know... Do you guys want some wine? Can I get you some wine? - Sure. - Well, that's a good point, you can look but you can't touch, is that the deal? (all speaking indistinctly) - That's a beautiful blue, by the way, I like the. - You actually can make that from theory into technology but you don't even know anything yet about what technology to apply to that because it can-- - We are not trying to launch a rocket ship. We can record this room and be in the shed and be viewing all this like that. - There's two things that holidays make me. They make me either really depressed or they make me really horny. - Ah. - And right now-- - Are you depressed? - No. I read this "Time Magazine" article that anxiety can be really good if used the right way. - Point me in the right direction. - Maybe you should go first and then I'm gonna go after you. Okay? Yeah, okay? - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey! - What's going on? (sighing) - I guess it was a good Thanksgiving party, huh? - Is it over, we just got food. What, are you done already, kicking everybody out? - A bowl of mashed potatoes. He's out there talking to a freaking blonde, who is she? - Oh, Mom, that's his assistant. - It's his assistant. - His assistant? Oh, it always happens that way, doesn't it? Mom, Mom, no. She keeps his schedule-- - Why is his assistant here? This is a family Thanksgiving! - Thank you for saying so, Carson, 'cause I was just kinda wondering the same thing about our boss. - What? - Yeah. - Are you drunk? - You seem very, yeah, I'm drunk, I think you and I maybe are in the same club. Maybe we should join a club together. - It's actually really good. - The mashed potatoes, yeah, they're really good. - I wasn't gonna eat 'em anyway. - No, Rita did a good job with those. - I lost my appetite. - I'll smash them in her face. - No, no, no, Mom, Mom! Look, you know what, cut the crap. - Me cut the crap? - Yeah, cut the crap, yeah. - Now I'm cutting crap. That's kinda funny, that's kinda funny, because-- - Did you find the aspirin? - I did, thank you. - Oh, you're so welcome. - I'm good, thanks. - See? - Yeah, see what? - See, see, paranoid. - Plenty, I saw plenty. Oh, paranoid, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, how's it going? - Everything all right? - Yeah. Everything's great. Everything's great. - It's going well, do you want some more-- - I feel very comfortable, it's a great Thanksgiving. I'm very happy right now, it's a holiday. - You seem a little, uh. - Hostile, yeah. - Yeah, you seem a little. - I don't know why, maybe it's just me, but something is telling me that there's something going on here that I'm not being made aware of. Is there anything that you'd like to maybe-- - Sorry, who was I with? - I don't know, it was right here. Right here in the middle of a family dinner, I don't know. - Tonight's Thanksgiving, I'm not really aware of what's going on. - I thought that we were, like, actually had feelings, I thought that there was actually an emotion being conveyed between the two of us but apparently I'm wrong because now Mr. Hotshot with the suit comes in and just sweeps you off your feet. - I didn't sweep anybody. - In front of everyone. That's fine, I'll leave, I'll leave. - What are you talking about? - Want me outta here, I'm gone. - [Carson] Nobody has to leave. - He's telling me that this involves me too. I don't understand what's going on here. - How does this involve you? I'm trying my best to be polite and political. Please, do me a favor and stop! - Stop what, I'm not doing anything? - All right, all right, that's it! - I'm being made to look like a fool, you understand? - Shut your mouth, shut your mouth! - She's fucking disrespecting me right in front of everyone. - Do you forget what you're doing? - I'm still a human being, I still have feelings-- - Do you wanna go back, do you think I give a shit about your personal feelings? This is business, and you better remember what we're doing here and how close we are. - In many businesses, the sum of the businesses are worth more than the individual parts, but it works the other way also and there are businesses where the individual components actually carry the rest of it. Now, when some part isn't going so well, they're looking to sell off some part and make a good profit on it. - And I swear to God, if you fuck this up, I will hunt you down, I will fucking cut you up. It's like that, my little friend. We are so very close to ending this. - That's what I have an uneasy feeling is happening over here and that's why I think some of this business is depressed almost purposefully. - Yeah. (door creaking) - Do you care if I told you I was horny? - Yeah, I take that very personally. - No, I'm serious. - I take it extremely personal. - I really do get one of two things. I either get, on Thanksgiving, seasonal affective disorder or I get horny. - Put your dick back in your pants. - It's not about my dick-- - And keep your mouth-- - It's not about my dick, it's about being disrespected blatantly in front of everybody-- - I don't give a fuck about you being disrespected, you understand? Do you wanna go back to that $2 an hour salary? - We sneak out, we create a diversion, then we get outta here, you understand? - I want something now. - I can't do it here. I can't, your mother's right outside the door practically. I can't. - I won't tell. - I can't do it here. - Unzip me, unzip me. - You can be destroyed, what did I just say to you? What did I just say to you? You better get your shit together and get your shit together right now, pal. Okay? - All right. - Unzip my dress. - She's nothing, baby. - She's shit. - She's nothing. - She's shit, fuck her. - You're gonna have blondes crawling outta your ass. If you know what I'm talking about, let's get-- - I don't know what I was thinking. - Hurry up, hurry up, okay, okay. - Okay, let's go. - You know, this whole goddamn entire network was worth more shut down than it is open. - I know. - This Charlie character, he was brought here. - Charlie-- - To get rid of all these people, firing all these people. - I understand. - Now he's having an affair with her. - I don't know if he's having an affair. - I don't know if he had an affair. I don't give a shit he's having an affair. All I know is he's not doing what he came here to do and I brought you here to have him do what he's supposed to do. And that's not happening either. - Okay, okay. - You cut my lip. - I did? - Am I bleeding? - Is it bleeding? (moaning) Oh, my gosh. - [Benny] What the fuck is going on here? - Jesus Christ. - My dress got stuck. - Oh, really, your dress got stuck? This is business as usual, I'm sure. This is how things work. - It's not business as usual. I don't wanna spoil everybody's holiday here. You know what's going on here. - I don't wanna spoil a holiday! - I think it's obvious-- - God for-fucking-bid! I don't wanna spoil a holiday! There's obviously-- - The door was fucking closed. This isn't your house. - Oh, I'm sorry, you're right, I shoulda knocked. - Benny, my dress, my zipper got-- - Let me tell you something, let me tell you something! - Let's get dressed and let's get the fuck outta here. - No, no, no, I don't wanna fucking interrupt you. Go ahead and do what you gotta do. - No, you're not interrupting at all, it's fine. - You guys have a wonderful time. - Benny. - No, no, no, listen. You go back to what you were doing. - Deal with him before-- - I'm done! - You guys decided-- - Hey, I'm done! - Good! - You can have her, she's all yours. Have a great time. - Great, thank you. - I'm going back to fixing this company and saving the network 'cause that's what matters to me. Bye bye, bye bye. (door slamming) - [Charlie] Let's get outta here, what do you got? You got something to put on, what did you do? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I got passionate and you know when you get passionate. - You didn't lock the door? - When you kiss somebody and you do the lip thing with your front tooth. - [Charlie] Why didn't you lock the fucking door? - Charlie's not doing his job. What the fuck are you doing here? - He's a good guy. He's got a good heart. - He's a good guy? We don't have any time for good guys. The Chinese called me today, he said the deal is still on but we only have so many more days to get this going. - My shoes are out there. - This Moxie character's getting in the way too. - Well, can she be bought? What is she worth, can she be bought? Have you approached her with that? - I don't think this one can be bought. - You don't think this, anybody can be bought. What kind of numbers are you putting on the table? - If we go that way, we can get out that way. - Out the window? - Yeah. Let's not go out the window. - No, that's a great idea. - Go out the window? - Yeah. - Okay. If we both die. - You're on the first floor, we're not going die. - Oh, okay. I love you. - Okay. I love you too. - Can I have everybody's attention, please! For one second. I'm sorry to interrupt your evening and ruin your dinner. I think there's some things that need to be discussed, that need to be brought out in the open here. Um, we have all been living in this fear, this fear, since these visitors came, these visitors from New York. - Hold the window. - Who's gonna-- - Hold the fucking window! I wanna get outta here! - Chill out! - We've been ducking or we've been running, looking over our shoulder and pointing fingers at the next guy. - [Charlie] Hold this. - [Moxie] Shh, shh, okay. All right. - And everybody's looking for this missing money 'cause we wanna know, who is cutting our lifeblood? Why is this happening to us, because we're a family, right? Right, we're family? But it wasn't until this very moment when I realized that my heart was in the wrong place. I want you all to know that I have figured it out. I have the answer we've been looking for. I know who the thief is! And this guy, Mr. Big Shot, the guy who's going to hire and fire and tell you where you're gonna be tomorrow, Charlie Moon, he's a crook, and he's in cahoots with Moxie! They stole the money together! (everyone shouting) It kills me to have to say this, but it's the truth! - Moxie didn't steal anything! - Benny, Benny-- - That's a bottom-line number! - It wasn't Moxie, it wasn't Moxie! Don't go blaming her. - Who should I blame then? Who should I blame, Mack? - It was me. It was me, I did it, I took it. (everyone gasping) I was gonna put it back. I, I was just trying to figure out how to replace it. I got this deal with this Japanese promo commercial thing. They wanna pay me a ton of money to have an old guy go surf huge waves in Hawaii and get a photograph. They put it up on a poster under a Japanese beer logo and, and, and, and. (sighing) - Why, Mack? - You know, you ladies think you've got the corner on the market on change of life, menopause. Well, you don't, you know. Guys go through something like that too. I don't know about you guys, but this guy goes through that too, and when everything starts to change, you know, and you're getting, when everything that defined you, that made you feel alive, like you were living, starts to fade away, what are you gonna do, you know? I started doing some stupid shit. I started gambling on long shots and investing a little bit and not so wisely and I started playing with the stock market. The fire in the belly starts to fade and the bones start to creak, and I live on the juice, I live on the adrenaline, the testosterone, the endorphins. It's the juice of life, so I take some risks. I have to find some other way to create the buzz that I live on because that's what I need. I invested on crazy investments. I speculated on high-risk stocks because high risk is what makes it appealing. It's what makes me feel young and happy and alive and fucking relevant for a little while, but I was always going to put it back. - Okay, all right, enough, enough! We don't need confessions. - I know who you are. - You do? - Yeah, I do. - Who am I? - I know that you're running the show around here. I know I'm not the only one around who's been telling some lies, okay? - And you're saying it's not Moxie and Charlie, you did it? - I'm not saying it's not them, I'm saying it is me. - It is you, and the reason you did it? - I told you. - We may have to contact the authorities. - Well, I probably deserve that. - I'm gonna have to get in touch with corporate, I am sorry. - Then you put me in jail if that's what you need to do but know that I did not mean to hurt anyone. - Don't you love an honest man? Get over here, come here, come here. Oh, my god, you are like the man I met 20 years ago. You know what, let me tell you something. I have been, unbeknownst to you, doing a little Internet business with my sisters, and I have been making money hand over fist and I'm telling you something, I'm gonna be able to put all that money back and more and you and I are gonna talk woman to woman. - Okay. - And you and I are gonna talk about everything else. So let's just enjoy the party, okay? Okay? - What? That is so fucked up, that is so fucked up! What the fuck, wait a minute, wait a minute! You people are all just going to be okay with that? No, no, fuck this shit! No, no, I'm sorry, I am not just gonna be complacent. - There's sometimes change you can't control. Just shut up, man. - What kind of business? - What kind of business? Vibrators. - Oh my god! We really gotta talk. - And listen, have you ever heard a man talk about menopause before? - No, no, no. - Are you going through it? - Are you going through it? - Yes, I am. - It's fucking crazy, right? - My mind is gone. - Johnnie, I'm in the shed, can you hear me? Can you hear me, okay, good. Okay, now switch to router six where you'll see Moxie and Charlie Moon, that's the inside of the TV studio where you linked those cameras up. - I feel like I'm having some kind of thing, you know, like a-- - Existential crisis? - No, what is that? - Existential crisis. (laughing) Whatever you're going through right now. - What are you talking about, existential crisis? - (laughing) Oh my god. - What does that mean? - You need so much help. - I feel like I'm on the verge of like something's gonna, like something's-- - That's good! - I feel like something's gonna-- - That's good! (laughing) - You know, like I'm on helium, that's what I feel like. Helium, like a balloon. - Helium? - Does that make sense? - That's so good, yes! - Is that a good thing? - Yes! - Now we're gonna switch it over to Moxie's living room, router three. Yeah, that's right, okay. - Goodbye, everybody! - Bye! - I love you, have each other and your corrupt crazy ways! - Now switch back to router six. - That's how I've lived my life, you understand? - All right, I get it. - It's always looking. It's always looking to protect and this edge and-- - I just got my period. - What, is that a good thing? - I just dropped an egg, I don't know. I don't know how long I can have this conversation. I need to insert something. - Here, sit on this. - Sit on that! I'm about to get major cramps, do you understand? - Then lean back. - No! Okay. - Just lean back. (sobbing) - I just wanna lie here and bleed. - Now, we're gonna switch it over to Moxie's living room where her mother and aunts are right now watching TV. ("Battle Hymn of the Republic") - Oh! Yay! (laughing) (clapping) - I used to be a girl, I always referred to myself as a girl and now I'm a woman and I love it. Menopause, for me, has actually forced me into healing a lot of stuff that I hadn't dealt with in my life. - I don't feel like I have to be as nurturing any longer. I don't feel like I have to be everybody's caregiver. I feel liberated. - I would much rather have 100 hot flashes than one day of the cramps that I used to have when I had it, I was doubled over in pain for two to three of the seven days of my period. - Menopause, for me, is the change, which they call it the change, of life, and really finding my authentic self. - I feel like more of a woman. I feel more vital, more alive, more happy. - I feel more invigorated by life than I think I have in 20 years and probably because I have lived in service to other people for most of the past 20 years. I've lived in service to my husband, to his career. I've lived in service to my children, to their education, and now it's about me. - We're wise women now, we just need a culture that values wise women. - Now I've heard about the atrophy of the vagina and I say if you don't want a muscle to atrophy, you exercise it. (laughing) I mean, it's the best thing to do. - You do have to exercise it. I have Bob, my battery-operated boyfriend. - My vibrator, called Brutus, is a monkey with a banana, holding a banana, and the monkey does certain things and the banana does very, very nice things and I don't have to beg it for sex, I don't have to plead with it for sex, I don't have to say, "I'm tired tonight." Whenever I feel like it, it's a wonderful experience. - Except it can't write a check. (laughing) - I don't understand where my body is going. My breasts are going to my waist, my ass is gonna end up on the floor, I have veins in my legs, I don't have veins in my legs, my grandmother has veins in her legs. - Okay, now switch to router two, the studio. - I still don't know what God was thinking! (Moxie screaming) - [Charlie] What is the address? - What is happening here? - Oh my god! - Put it down, put it down. - Is that Moxie? - It is, what is going on? - She's on TV. - Hello? - Yes, yes, it's working. - Put it down, put it down! - Put the fucking phone down! - Okay, it's down, it's down! - Let me decide if I want a goddamn ambulance. - You said you wanted-- - I can't watch this. - Oh, my god, darling. - I gotta hear a sorry, I gotta hear a sorry. - There's nothing more to tell. - Okay, well, tell it again. - [Lulu] Oh, she's finally got her period. - God, you poor baby. (Moxie groaning) - Put your feet up. - No! Don't touch anything! - [Lulu] I'm so glad I'm over that. - No more periods. - Oh, my god. Ever, ever. - Okay, a few hot flashes. - I really love you. - Do you want me-- - I love you so much. - Do you want me to get you something? - Kiss me. - Oh my god. - I'm hoping I still have a job and I-- - Do you have any of those in a closet or anything? ♪ Turn down the heat ♪ ♪ Open the window ♪ ♪ Or just step outside ♪ ♪ And let the cool wind blow ♪ ♪ My thermostat's broken, the one in my body ♪ ♪ I feel like I've had a giant hot toddy ♪ - I'm in the middle of a cramp, in the middle of a cramp.

You do wanna have an orgasm. - Imagine, we have not been able to control our reproductivity as a human species for very long. Think of the relief that women felt when finally it was over. I just feel like that part of my life is over and I like to think of myself as a tree whose foliage is going into full color right before my final season. I really do, I'm reinventing myself.
