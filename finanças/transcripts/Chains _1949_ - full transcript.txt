CHAINS Stop, thief! - Is there a mechanic around here? - That way. Help me push, will you? - Come on! - Push! Now let's have some money. Settle down, boys! Share this among yourselves. What's wrong? It suddenly stalled. I don't know the problem. Probably the ignition coil - Never you mind. I need a mechanic. I am a mechanic. Go on. Call someone. Hurry up. Daddy, this man's ignition coil is busted. I'm not really sure it's the ignition coil. It won't start. - Try it. Yes, it's the ignition coil. - I told you. Can you change it now? I'm in a hurry. Bring me a new one and I'll have it ready in 15 minutes. Can't you take one from another car? I'll bring a new one tomorrow. Sorry, I can't. - What do I do now? - Come back tomorrow. Could I use your phone? Tonino, show this man to the phone. - My lovely Angelina. - You'll get me dirty! Good heavens! The little lady's putting on airs! Of course. She has a new dress. Tired, darling? Like it, Daddy? Yes, sweetie. It's beautiful! Whose car is this? A young man brought it in. He's making a call. - Hi, Mom. - Look at your face! How did you get so dirty? - I've been working. I'll bring a new coil tomorrow. Keep the car inside. Easier said than done, but we'll manage somehow. Let me have your name. - What for? - Isn't it your car? - Oh, right. Mino Rossi. Wait a minute. I'm going upstairs. Don't be late. I'm fixing rice the way you like it. I'll be right there. - You need me anymore, Dad? - No, run along. Yes, Captain! - Here you are. - What's that? Your receipt, to make it official. Thanks. See you later. Come on, little girl. Time for bed. Don't start that again! Did you hear what Daddy said? But Tonino doesn't have to go to bed. Because you're a child, and he's a young fellow now. Enough of this " young fellow"! Soon he'll want to be called a" young gentleman." - Give Daddy a kiss. - Night, Daddy. Good-bye, young fellow. - I have to go. - At this hour? What can I do? I promised. - Where are you going? - To tow a truck. - Take me along. - I won't be back before midnight. Go to bed now. - Good night, Dad. Good night, Grandma. - You're going out at this hour? - Don't start, Mother. Minotti asked me to do him a favor. He's interested in my plans. He might put up some money. Great idea, leaving it there. You really take the cake! Should I have left it right in the street? Yes, you idiot! Now I'm really in a bind. I knew I shouldn't trust you. I called, but you'd gone out. No answer at the garage. Did you at least get the registration out of the car? All right. Let's go see if we can find them at home. Evening, ma'am. May I speak with your husband? - He's not here. - When's he due back? Midnight, maybe later. I brought a car in for repair today. Maybe you recognize me. I need to get it back. - I said my husband's not home. I have to leave right away, and I need the car. I just have to change the ignition coil here. What can I tell you? My husband's not home. Wait, ma'am. Here's the receipt to prove I brought the car in. I'm sure you did, but what am I supposed to do? Just open the garage. It'll take me five minutes. - What took so long? - The husband's not home. I had to persuade the wife to open up. She's coming down now. Make it quick. I can't rest easy till this is taken care of. Quiet - here she comes. There it is. It'll just take a minute. Rosa! You! Emilio, what do I do here? Wire it up any way you can. We'll fix it up later. Who could have imagined, after all this time? Cat got your tongue? Sorry to see me? No, why should I be sorry? But didn't you go to America? Yes, a long time ago, but I've been back a while. First I settled in Torino for a long time, then I went to France, then there was the war, and now here I am. You're as lovely as ever. - Will it be much longer? No, ma'am. Almost done. Remember that night when we strolled out this way and you were afraid? How should I? It was so long ago. Well, I remember like it was today. Are you married? - Yes. - Happily? - Very! All done. Shall we go? Go open the gate. Here's for storing the car and all the bother. I hope we meet again. - It's better we don't. - Why? - Because there's no point. I have my life, you have yours. Besides - Besides what? Nothing. Go on now. Good night. As you wish. Does your husband know about me? - No, not a thing. But I could have told him. I had nothing to hide. No, of course not. I was just curious. Good night. Here. Did you get back early last night? No, it took forever, and then it started to rain - Look at this! - What? That car yesterday - it was stolen. - Really? - It's right here. " Car stolen in Posillipo yesterday about 5:00 p.m. Rome license plate 1 1841 4. Stolen when unattended for a moment." That's it. I remember the license number. You shouldn't have let them take it last night! - But who could have imagined - - Forget it. Now we're in a real mess. We have to notify the police. The police? Of course. Just imagine. If they get whiff of this, they'll think I was involved. Dad, tell them it was me. I'm just a minor. Anyway, what's done is done. Did that guy come get it himself? - Yes. - Alone? - No, with another man - - Who? - I don't know. - What did he look like? - I couldn't tell. It was dark. Come on now - I said I don't know! I didn't see. All right, all right. The police will know. Let's hope they solve it quickly. Good-bye, darling. How did it go? Great. They arrested all of them. - All of them? - Yes. They got the car back. Good thing I went to the police. I got there just in time. Luckily the inspector knows me. - And - - What? Nothing. A bunch of hoods who specialize in car theft. They were all in handcuffs. I recognized the guy who came here right away. There were five or six of them. Well, take Angelina to school. - What? Hurry and take her to school. It's almost 9:00. - Mama, buy me a monkey. - No. Tomorrow. - No, now! - You can be such a bother! How much for one? - A hundred lira. - Can you make change? - No, ma'am. Allow me. Here. Let's go. Thanks for not mentioning my name. I got out of that one thanks to you. Please, go away! If you'd mentioned my name, I'd be in jail now instead of enjoying this sun. It was very kind of you. Go away, I tell you! Sorry you saved me? Yes. I didn't know you were a thief! Now that you know, are you going to turn me in? There's still time. We can go tell your husband that I was there last night, that we go back years. You swine! What an ugly word! You say that because when we parted - No, I thank God I was so lucky. Sure. You married well, no doubt about it. I married a gentleman, and I love him. And what do you care anyway? Leave me alone. That's all I ask. Wait a moment. Where's the fire? - What do you want? - To talk to you. We have nothing more to say to each other. - Can we meet again? - No. - I think we can. - You're wrong. You always said no back then too, and then - That's past and forgotten now. Well, I remember it perfectly, and if you like, I can refresh your memory. When your mother made you You know what she did? To cook up such a nice dish What did she use? A hundred rosebuds crushed in a mortar Then she added milk and roses And whisked you up in the blink of an eye It doesn't take a gypsy to figure it out - Where can Tonino be? - With his father. Getting the fireworks ready? That's dangerous. He could get hurt, and so could Guglielmo. Dear Lord! Hiring on to handle the fireworks! Please go see. I'll wait here with Angelina. All right. Straighten up that pole. Tonino, what are you doing? Get out of here, boys. I told you not to touch this stuff. Then how can I help you? This isn't a job for you. Go find your mother. Let's go, boys. Finish connecting those fuses. Good evening. I told you we'd meet again. It's fate. Excuse me... It's no use. They won't let you by. Where are you going in such a hurry? Come back This heart is waiting Hear that song? They still sing it. Don't you remember? Set everything off when the lights go out. Wait for my signal. Understood? I said to get out of here. Mind me or I'll give you a good one. - I'm going, I'm going. - Ready? - Yes. Set them all off. You too up there. Rosa, it's no use trying to get away. Don't forget: When I get something in my head - Just what do you want? Nothing. I like looking at you, talking to you. What's wrong with that? We loved each other once. You loved me? Yes, I did. Don't believe me? You're wrong. And you know what? I still love you. And you still love me. You're mad! If you didn't love me, you wouldn't try to get away. You wouldn't treat me like this. You wouldn't be afraid of me. - Me, afraid? - That's right. Of me and the things you wrote so long ago. I found the most beautiful of all your letters. Shall I read it? No matter. I know it by heart. " You'll always be the only love of my life. I can forget everything but your kisses." That's enough! I was all set to leave last night and get away from here for good. But I changed my mind. I've decided to stay. But I won't bother you. I won't insist on seeing you. I'll wait. - For what? I don't know. I'll trust in fate. It's been on my side so far. It led that car to your husband's garage. It saved me from prison, with your help. It brought us together tonight. Tomorrow... who knows? Good-bye, Rosa. I found the most beautiful of all your letters. I know it by heart. " You'll always be the only love of my life. I can forget everything but your kisses. " That's enough! It's almost noon - time to get Angelina at school. You're right. - Mother, you go, please. - Me? I don't feel like going out today. - What's wrong? - Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? You haven't gone out in over a week. That look on your face, and you don't say a word. Don't you feel well? I feel fine. I just don't want to go out. - Guglielmo's noticed too. - Noticed what? This mood. You're just imagining things. See how you're on edge? Fine, I'll get Angelina. You need anything? No, thanks. Dad says to make coffee. He's bringing a man by. - What man? - I don't know. They're talking business. Here they come! - Why don't they go to a caf?! Make yourself at home. This way. I'll go get the papers. I've run estimates on workers, taxes, insurance. I've even got blueprints. - Very good. Some coffee? Have a seat. Rosa, is the coffee ready? - Just a minute. - Hurry. - Who is it? - I'll tell you later. Have a seat, please. It's you? Here they are. Set it here. Allow me to - What was your name again? - Emilio Marchi. - My wife. - Very pleased to meet you. - A pleasure. He's suggested I use the space next to the garage. I'm showing him the plans I drew up. Sit down. This is the expansion plan. These are the two biggest areas. One's very large, as you can see. I thought I'd put the body shop there. We could even put in a glass ceiling. One? - Yes, thanks. - And the cost? - I have it all here. Where'd I put that? Here it is. My estimates are on the generous side. Two million. Not much. These are materials needed: tools, machines. Practically nothing. As I mentioned, I have a few things already. Good. - May I speak to you? - Can't it wait? - It's about all this. - Really? Then let's hear it. My wife and I have no secrets. - Perhaps your wife disapproves. - Why would she? You know how women always fear new things. Take these papers and study them well. May I get your address? - No, I'll stop by again. No, to send you my lawyer's notes. Where do you live? - The Albergo Commercio. - Where is that? - Down by the port. I'll have an answer soon. - Very well. - Ma'am. - I'll see you out. Just what was all that about? You interrupted our business talk for no reason at all. He's not some nobody. Montecchi at Fiat introduced him. You made me look bad. I just thought it was crazy to get involved with someone you've never seen before. I just told you: Montecchi introduced us. But why involve anyone else? We're fine like this, with no one else to answer to. Please drop the whole thing. Why? Let's be happy just as we are, like your mother always says. Listen, let me handle this. These aren't matters for a woman. I know what I'm doing. Now put these things away while I join Tonino downstairs. No, he's not in. He leaves in the morning and comes back at night. You don't know where I might find him? Try the Caff? Vasile. He's always there. Now then, father's last name? Excuse me. Have you seen Mr. Marchi? Have a look in the pool hall. Take over for me. I knew you'd come looking for me. - I have to talk to you. - Come in. Don't be afraid. They're all friends. Straight ahead. Don't be afraid. Wait a minute. One moment. Now, what do you have to tell me? Emilio, don't use that tone of voice. I've only come because I can't take it anymore! I'm going mad! You're so beautiful when you're angry. Stop this, Emilio! Would you like something, sir? - Coffee for me. And you? - Nothing. Make it two. Why did you come see my husband? - I had a business offer. Business! You're a thief! - I was a thief. Not anymore. I've changed professions. Your husband's very nice. A serious fellow, with plans for the future. I think we'll get along just fine. Are you serious? Why not? We'll put together a great deal. He needs money to expand the garage. I'll get it for him, and we'll be partners... and share everything. If you dare come by again, I'll tell my husband everything! Like what? That we knew each other before and planned to marry. I should have told him that first night. It was a mistake, and I regret it. But now I want to end this. I can't go on. Congratulations. Good idea. And what if he thought we'd been lovers too? Lovers! Could you be so vile and contemptible as to tell him a lie like that? I'll kill you first, you hear me? Think it over calmly, my dear. I've found you once more and never want to lose you again. I waited for days to talk to you again, but you stayed indoors, so I hit on this idea. I found out about your husband's plans, so I became sincerely interested. You think I can't become a gentleman too? I must have you near. I still love you like before. More than before! Don't be afraid. I'll ask for nothing. I'll just wait. - For what? For you to be like you were before, when you would wait for me, seek me out, and forget everything to be with me. Remember when you snuck out of the house to come see me in the service in Salerno? And when you came to the ship and didn't want me to go? You held on to me desperately. You cried and cried, and I left. I traveled the world, doing every kind of job: from cabin boy on a ship to a banker in Cuba. Funny, isn't it? I had run-ins with the police everywhere I had a hundred names and a hundred faces. I only came back to my senses when I saw you again. I owe it all to you. Emilio, the past is past. Now I have my home, my family, my children. I'm happy. Really? And I mean to go on being happy. That's not true. I could see at once you still loved me and that you'll never drive this passion from your heart. Tell the truth: Am I right? God knows how I prayed to be cured of that sickness, and I was. That's why I ask you to have pity. As a favor to me. Leave me alone. I'm just a poor woman. Have pity on me. Leave me alone. Rosa, listen - Don't say anything. If in a moment of weakness I gave in, I'd be so ashamed and disgusted with myself that I'd despise you. I'd despise you! Now get out of my life! Good-bye. Grandma, I'm hungry. Who was supposed to go get Angelina? Rosa said she would. The neighbor had to bring her home. I don't understand. - Where did Rosa go? - Probably shopping. - What time did she leave? - 10:30 or so. It's almost 1 :00. I hope nothing's happened. I'm sure she's just been delayed. Did you go get her? No, a neighbor brought her home. She was waiting half an hour. You're exaggerating. It was ten minutes. If you couldn't go, you could have asked me. Of course I could go, and I went! - Who are you mad at? - Nobody. We only brought it up because you - Fine, I was wrong - as always! Now listen - What's wrong with her? - She's just a little on edge. Go sit down for lunch. I've told you not to fill up on bread. - Yes, Captain! - Take Angelina with you. Say anything and she flies off the handle. Is this done? Yes, it's ready. I told you: Pay no attention. We all have our bad moods. She's probably tired. From what? She's always cooped up inside. Try to get her mind off things. How? Oh! Tuesday is her birthday! Take her out. Show her a good time. Take her out for some fresh air. There are so many nice spots around. Take this in. I'll be right there. Naples has awakened to the sound of song And guitars are heard once more The air is fresh and fragrant And a goldfinch greets me at dawn My gypsy girl, sorry for what she did Wrote me a beautiful love letter Listen.... Listen... My dearest love Good afternoon. How are you? - Not bad, thanks. My Neapolitan heart trembles Tonino, I got the ball! Hello, Emilio. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. Will you join us? No, thanks. - Hello. How are you? - Fine, and you? - I haven't seen you around. - I'm sorry. I was away for a few days. I meant to come by. Good afternoon, ma'am. - Here for lunch? - No, I've eaten. I just came to look around. - Have a coffee with us. Let me introduce you. Mr. Marchi, Mrs. Capuana, Mr. Franzi and his wife, and Mrs. Anquissola. If you'd care to sit down... Move. Please. I sent you my lawyer's notes. Thanks, I got them. - Do that trick with the bottle. - Which one? Oh, right. Quiet, everyone. Ready? There. One, two - Cut that out! Three. Do it again! - No, that's it. - Where's the bottle? Right here. Okay, once more. Don't think I've given up. I'm just waiting. Lovely song, isn't it? Is it your first time in these parts? - I was born here. - Really? Have you always lived here? - Never. What a shame! I found out you were here and came to wish you happy birthday. Guglielmo, shouldn't we be going? Going? Already? It's early. This is such a nice spot. I'd spend my whole life here. Listen to her! You devil! Any song you'd like to hear? Sing "O sole mio. " No, "Ohi Mar?. " No, "Funicul?, funicul?. " Make up your minds! Rosa, what was that song you wanted to hear? I don't remember. They're all lovely. - Do you know " Torna"? - Yes, that's an old one. Please sing that. It's a beautiful song. I want you in my arms again I just have to accept you as you are I want those eyes, that face Where happiness dances and plays Dream of my life Tell me where I can find you again Come back This heart is waiting Come back For I long to see you Come back If you'll come back to me We'll never part again With a hundred treacherous desires Your mirror led you to ruin My soul wept when you left Wondering where you could have gone Who keeps you from me now? What chains must I break To have you once again? - Come on. - Go away. - What's wrong? - Go away! You don't want to play anymore? Come play. If you'll come back to me We'll never part again Do you feel ill? Let's have a lively one now. I happened to meet the gentleman In charge of that station with Marconi's new telephone When he heard my meager voice He hired me on the spot And on the radio I sang A song to my Fifi Over the wireless tel-tel-telephone I tell of all the crazy things We do for love! - Not eating again tonight? - I don't like it. - You've always liked it. - Not tonight. - Try it. It's good. - I said no! Hey! Is that how you talk to your mother? Apologize. Never mind. Absolutely not. Did you hear me? I said apologize. You shouldn't have done that. Please, Mother. He got what he deserved. You overreacted. No need to make a scene. Did you hear that tone of voice? - I'll go see - - Mother, let him be. Guglielmo, we can't send him to bed without dinner. Don't worry. He won't starve. Who could that be at this hour? No, I'll get it. Mother, keep an eye on Angelina. What's wrong? Why don't you answer me? Nothing's wrong. What's going on? Don't you feel well? Leave me alone! So your father was right. You got what you deserved. Sorry to disturb you at this hour, but it's been a busy day. Don't mention it. Forgive me, ma'am, but I couldn't come by earlier. I'm sorry, but an opportunity's come up that's too good to turn down. I'm leaving for Venezuela. - Right away? - Yes. Too bad. I mean for me. I've been planning this project for some time. It came up quite suddenly. Friends there wired me about an important position, so I must leave right away. All I can say is good luck and bon voyage. I'm so sorry. I'd already discussed financing with the bank. We could have started right away. Oh well. Here are your plans. I think they're all there. - Have you been to America? - Once, but not for very long. - Angela, time for bed. - I'll take her. Good night, Mommy. Night, Daddy. Good-bye, ugly. - Good-bye, beautiful. Your idea's good. I'm sure you'll find an interested party. But I must be off now. Ma'am. By the way, do you have Montecchi's number? Montecchi? Hold on. It's 35- Do you remember? Where'd I put my address book? Excuse me. Did you hear me? Tomorrow at 5:00. It's 35-70-80. Want to write it down? My apologies once again. Good night. You said 35- - 70-80. Hey! Did you sleep in your clothes? I was tired and just fell asleep. - What in the devil's going on? - Nothing. What's all this about? If you don't feel well, we'll call a doctor. I'm fine. Tonino, your father's always been your friend too. If I slapped you, you had it coming. You've always been a good son. Are you mad at your dad? Then tell me: Did something happen? No, nothing. - Did somebody hurt you? - No, nobody. Don't look away. Answer me. There's nothing wrong. Then get up and stop all this. You've been like this since yesterday. You won't talk, not even to your mother. Don't be afraid. What's wrong? - Nothing. Always the same thing! You know what the truth is? You're just a bad boy and a liar. I break my back working all day, but you'd rather stay up here than help me. Don't say that, Dad. It's not the work. I can handle that alone, even if I fall down dead. But I don't like seeing you like this. What kind of son are you? Don't you care about your father or your mother? You're an ingrate and a bad son! Daddy, don't say that! It's not true! All right. Let's drop it. There's no point crying. Stay inside today, but come down tomorrow. Just to get your mind off things. All right? Okay, Dad. Tomorrow. See you later. Look at her pretty dress. - Will the skirt be velvet too? - No, silk. Look how pretty! And we'll put a lovely blue sash around her waist. Will you make a hat for her too? First we have to finish her dress. Mommy. Mommy, you're hurting me. - Has anyone been asking for me? - No. - Is that clock reliable? - It's the only thing here that is. - Excuse me. - Yes, sir. - Could you run an errand for me? - Certainly. - Is your mother in? - Yes. Why? - Call her for me. - But - Go on. Good day, ma'am. I have some tablecloths to show you. Look what beautiful material. No, thank you. I don't need any. Perhaps next time. This is from someone you know. Good-bye, ma'am. " Rosa, I've been waiting. If you're not here within one hour, I'll tell your husband everything, and whatever happens, happens. Remember: It's him or me! I'll be waiting at my hotel." Mommy. Look how pretty she is. You like her? Yes, very pretty. Are you crying? No, it's nothing. Now go play with your doll. Rosa, I'm going out for a moment. Give me some money for cooking oil, since I'll be out anyway. - Here. - All right. Tonino, want to come with me? No, Grandma. - Are you going out? - Yes. When Grandma returns, tell her I'll be back soon. Aren't you taking Angelina? No, I have to run some errands. Keep an eye on her. - Where are you going? - I told you: I have things to do. Just why do you need to know? - I'm going with you. - You weren't feeling well. I'm fine now. Then go help your father. No, I want to go with you. What's this tone of voice about? I just want to go with you. What's wrong with that? You've been watching me like a hawk for some time now, but I have nothing to hide. I didn't say anything. Then what do you want? I love you, Mommy. I love you so much. You have to understand... I'm young and I don't know how to say certain things. I don't understand. I love you so much. We all do. Don't hurt us, Mommy. - How would I hurt you? Do it for me, Mommy. Don't go out. Tonino, my son! Tonino, don't talk like this! For the love of God, you're frightening me! Be good now. Mommy won't hurt you. Stop crying now. I have to go now. I'll be back soon. No, Mommy. Don't go. That's enough now! No, you mustn't go! - Let me by. - No, I won't! I won't! Let me by. Stop this! I said stop it! Hi, Rosa. What's wrong with her? - Daddy! - What is it? - Tonino had a fight with Mommy. - What? He had a fight with Mommy. He had a fight with Mommy? What's going on? What happened? Nothing. - What are you crying about? - Nothing. I know why. Mommy slapped him. Why? Did you make your mother mad again? Did you talk back to her? You must have, if she hit you. What did you do? He held on to her skirt so she couldn't go out. Is that true? Yes, I didn't want her to go out. Why not? Think you can tell your mother when she can go out? Now you've gone too far. I can understand whims now and then, but defying your mother! After everything you promised me! I'll have to teach you a serious lesson, because going easy on you doesn't work. Now get out of my sight! Where did Mommy go? I don't know. She got a letter and went out. A letter? What letter? What letter are you talking about? It's not true. Angelina doesn't understand. I do too. I saw it myself. She read it and started crying. - Crying? She read a letter and started crying? And then she put it - - Where? - I don't know. Yes, you do. Tell me. In the bureau drawer. Here I am. I did what you wanted. I'm here... to ask you for the last time: What do you want? I told you, and I put it in writing: It's me or him. And this time I'll go to any length. Oh yeah? Then so will I! I'll kill you, you bastard! I'm right here. Go ahead. I'm not afraid, like you. You're trembling. Go on. Shoot. Dear God! What have I done to suffer like this? Rosa, you mustn't cry. Try to understand: This isn't just a whim. It's much more serious. I only realize now how much I loved you and still love you. I can't wait on a street corner hoping to see you. I want your happiness and mine. We'll leave together, go far away, and forget everything. You can't say no. Why settle for a life without love? I can tell you love me. You're right: I'm crazy. So crazy that I would - Let me go! You swine! Let me go! Guglielmo! - Get out of here! - For the love of God - I can explain! - Go on! I said get out of here! Just as well you came. Open up! Open this door! Open up! They'll kill each other! What's going on? - What happened? - I heard a shot! - Where are you going? - I don't know. But I won't go to jail - not for that tramp! Blessed Virgin! How could you do it? I saw her in his arms and lost my head. I grabbed him by the throat, and we rolled on the ground. He pulled out a pistol, but I wrestled it from him and shot him in self-defense. What have you done? Don't yell, Mother, and don't make me lose time. This should last you a while. I'll send word. - Where are you going? - I don't know! My beautiful Angelina. My dear Tonino. Where are you going, Dad? I'll come back soon. Until I return... you'll have to be the captain here. God help you, my son! Mother, remember this: That woman is not to set foot in this house again! Understand? Come here. You too, Tonino. Swear before the Virgin. - I swear. - You too, Tonino. - I swear. Pray for me. Good-bye, Mother. - My son! - Awaiting your orders, sir. - You may go. Why are you still here? You can go. Where? Go home. You're finished here. You there - put out that cigarette and come with me. Here are your things. This is no longer your home. Go away! Mother, listen to me. I'm not guilty. I swear! Go away, wicked woman! You drove my son to ruin and destroyed our lives. No, it's not true. Hear me out. You can't turn me away like this! Go away, wicked woman! My boy! Guglielmo. - Ah, it's you. - It's all set. You sail tonight. - What about a passport? Here. The name's different, but it doesn't matter. You'll work it out there. Stay put until I come get you. See you soon. - Listen - - He's dead. And the police took her in. Any message for her? No, no message. You out of cigarettes? Take mine. See you later. Off to seek your fortune in America too? Great country, America. I sing and play guitar, but I'll do whatever work comes along. - Cigarette? - Thanks. Angelina, you're out of your mind! Why are you out of bed, sweetie? Dear Jesus! You have a fever! Let me stay here, Grandma. You should be in bed, sweetheart. I want to wait for Mommy. She's not coming back tonight. Mommy's far away. Tired? You've been crying again. When are you going to think about your health? Cry and work - that's all you do, dawn to dusk. I bought some fish for dinner. We'll grill it up, okay? Whatever you like. Grandma, Mommy's over there. I see her over there. Be a good girl and don't catch cold. Mommy, why don't you want to see me anymore? Sorry to disturb you so late, but - May I? Come in. What is it? - She's downstairs. - Rosa? What does she want? - I don't know. She asked me to tell you. She's afraid to come up on her own. She's waiting on the stairs. And knowing what happened, you would help her - I'm not helping anyone. She asked me to tell you. Why should I refuse? I didn't have the heart to tell her no. If you saw the state she's in - I never want to see her again - dead or alive - after all the harm she's done. I've come like a beggar. Just tell me to leave and I will, grateful all the same. - What do you want? - I don't know. I don't know how I found the courage to come. Maybe I'm dreaming. Blessed Virgin, don't let me wake up! So many nights I've passed beneath these windows in the dark, happy just to see the lights, knowing Angelina and Tonino would be at the table. Then their bedroom lights would go on. Then all the lights would go out, and I'd be left there watching. I could almost see them asleep in their beds. They're asleep now, aren't they? - Yes. I've watched Angelina come and go at school every day. She's never seen me. I always stay hidden. It was enough just to see her. Now, with the holidays, I can't see her: Christmas, New Year's, Epiphany. Everyone's happy this season, while I - I can't let you see her. Have pity on me! Let me see her! Just for a moment. What are you saying? I can't! - Just for one moment. - I swore I wouldn't! I won't say a word. She won't know. All these tears have taken away my voice. Don't say no. I'll leave right away. That will be my Christmas. Don't say no. Come. I promised my son before the Virgin. You understand? I understand. My little girl... - Nothing for me? - No. Mail for you. "I received your letter. We're all fine here. Christmas is coming, and Tonino has set up the Nativity scene. Angelina never stops asking for her mother. I tell her she'll be back soon... but she doesn't believe it. I pray to the Virgin for you always... " Hear all that carousing? They're like madmen. They're all drunk. They're smart. Drinking keeps dark thoughts away. Then let's drink too. Want some? I've had enough of that whiskey. Oh, for some red wine and roasted chestnuts. We eat chestnuts on Christmas Eve in my village too. We roast them in the fireplace. Where I'm from, they make the ring-shaped cake. My wife used to make a great one. All the children would gather around. The children... They're gathering around the Nativity scene now. Here are the sheep. Where do I put the shepherd? Next to the sheep. Will Baby Jesus bring Mommy home for Christmas? Yes, sweetheart. I'm sure he will. Will Mommy bring me presents? Certainly. Grandma. What? Shall we write a letter to Mommy? What would you tell her? Lots of things. That I'm waiting for her. Why do you have your mommy and daddy and I don't? Dearest Mother Christmas is almost here And being so far from home Leaves a bitter taste How I wish I could light some fireworks And hear the sound of the bagpipes Set up the Nativity scene for the children And set a plate for me at the table And when Christmas Eve comes Act as if I were there in your midst Oh, what this America has cost in tears For us Neapolitans For us who yearn for the Neapolitan sky This bread is bitter indeed In your letter you wrote That little Assunta's been crying out For her mother, who left and is now far away What can I say? If the children want their mother Let the woman come back But I will not return I'm still far away Working for all of you I, who have lost country, family, and honor I'm meat for the slaughter An emigrant Oh, what this America has cost in tears For us Neapolitans For us who yearn for the Neapolitan sky This bread is bitter indeed Come in. Wake up. - Who's there? - Police. Police. I got that. All right. Why are they arresting him? They're taking him back to Italy. Seems he killed a man there. - What's going on? - Keep quiet. Good-bye. Let's go. LAW OFFICE So you were the victim's lover. No, that's not true! He hounded me to leave with him. That's the only reason I went there that day. With God as my witness, I never cheated on my husband. I swear on the heads of my children. All right. Calm down. I'm here to defend your husband on charges of premeditated murder. You know what that means in layman's terms? Thirty years in prison. - My God! I'll be very frank. Do you want to help your husband? I'd give my life for him. Then you must tell me the truth without embarrassment, holding nothing back. Let's see here. How long had that man been your lover? Never, I swear! But you were caught in his hotel room! Yes, I went there, but only because he forced me to. Look. He sent me this a few days earlier. He threatened to destroy my life if I didn't join him. That day he sent another letter threatening me again. I got frightened and went to see him. But only to tell him to leave me alone! Go on, read it. Convinced now? He wouldn't have written those things to a lover. You believe me now? For God's sake, why didn't you stop your husband? I tried, but he wouldn't listen! He was like a madman. He locked me out of the room, and then... it was too late. No one will believe me! Not a single person! There, there. Tell me what I can do to save him. I'll do anything! Save him? That won't be easy now. You plan to assert your innocence in court? Of course. I want him to know and believe me. He'll believe you, all right. So will the court. So will everyone. But that won't save your husband from 30 years in prison. What do you mean? Your very innocence will condemn him. My innocence? But how? If I'd really been that man's lover, my husband could be acquitted? Maybe not acquitted, but it would certainly be grounds for a defense: an offense to his honor, provocation, crime of passion, self-defense. I could pursue the honor angle, or at least provocation and moral values, and perhaps find a way out. So you mean... if I were to say that... Your name is Rosa Carresi in Aniello, and you're the wife of the accused? You stated in preliminary proceedings that you'd known the victim for many years. Going back how far? - Before I married my husband. Was he your lover at that time? No, my fianc?. Why didn't you two marry? He left, promising to return. But he never did, right? Did your husband know you'd been engaged to this man? No, he knew nothing. - When did you see this man again? - A year ago. And did you immediately become his lover? Answer the question. Did you immediately become his lover? Yes. Silence! You denied that in preliminary proceedings. Why? I was ashamed. And now you've decided to confess. I have no further questions. Prosecutor, any questions for the witness? No, Your Honor. - Defense counsel? - Yes, Your Honor. The victim reserved two seats on a steamer for South America. Could the witness shed any light on that? Answer the question. I was to go away with him. You were ready to leave your husband and abandon your children? Yes. That's all. No further questions. Can we dismiss her now? You may go. Wicked woman! Home-wrecker! She turned her back on her own children! Tramp! Never seen anyone faint before? Open the door! A human being was killed. Respect for life, a gift from God, demands that the accused serve a sentence as a warning and an example. I therefore ask that the accused be sentenced to a term of... She alone bears the guilt here! Don't be swayed by her tired look, her trembling voice, her lies, her fainting spells. It's all a lie, like her whole life! Your Honors, it's not clemency but justice that I ask of you! Your verdict should reflect that the defendant's act of self-defense was the will of destiny. Indeed, we can say it was the will of God. Does the accused have anything more to say? No, Your Honor. The court will adjourn to deliberate. All rise. In the name of the Italian people, the Criminal Court of Naples, in the case of Guglielmo Aniello, per Article 479 of the Code of Penal Procedure and Article 52 of the Penal Code, finds that the accused acted in self-defense, and orders that the accused be immediately released. My son! Wait for me at home. Counselor, I'm deeply indebted to you. I owe you my life. Never mind all that. There's another debt on which you must make good immediately. Another debt? To whom? Your wife. You must be joking. That tramp - Stop right there. You don't deserve to even speak her name. You said I saved your life. That's not true. Your wife saved your life by sacrificing her own. What are you saying? Here. Read these. They're letters from her " lover." If she'd shown just one of these to the court, you'd be in prison for life. Go on - read them! - She should be ashamed! - Wicked woman! - Brazen hussy! - Home-wrecker! - Turned her back on her own children! - Tramp! Rosa, open up! Why did she lock it? - I don't know. Rosa, no! What are you doing? Get something for her. Hurry! Hurry. The lawyer told me everything. Now I know... and I'll make sure everyone knows. Yes, everyone must know. So you... you believe me? Yes, I believe you. - Our home. - How I've dreamed of this moment! Rosa, my daughter. Sweetheart! Subtitles by Subtext Subtitling, Los Angeles
