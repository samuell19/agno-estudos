[ Motor revs ] Taxi! Taxi! MAN: Excuse me, do you have a light? And an extra cigarette? Thanks. There's nothing like a morning cigarette. Coffee and cigarette. You wouldn't believe this dream l had. l dreamt l was back home with the missus, and l'm sitting in the kitchen next to her. . . JlM: Taxi! MAN: . . .drinking my coffee, smoking a cigarette. [ Taxi radio dispatch chatter ] And the missus says, ''Bunny, why don't you stay home from work today, and we'll be together, just the two of us, like this?'' She's not alive anymore, but. . . . . .a coffee would be nice, just like in the dream. JlM: Oh. . . Listen. . . You can have all my money. -l only have 50. . . -MAN: Hey! lf it's not enough, l'll go with you to an ATM, but please don't kill me. -l have two children. -MAN: Man, relax. l was just gonna ask you for a buck for coffee. l wasn't robbing you. This isn't even mine. Oh. So, may l ask whose it is? l don't know. l found it under my cardboard this morning. [ Chuckles, sighs ] You scared the shit out of me. MAN: So. . . how about it, Sir? Would you give me a buck for a cup of coffee? JlM: Oh, so, that's your drill. You scare the shit out of people, and then they're so grateful you're not really robbing them that they give you the money. MAN: Mate, you got it all wrong. Wrong, huh? So, why the hell did you take that gun? Actually, l thought to myself l'd ask the first person l saw for a coffee and a cigarette. And if that person said no? Then, l might as well join the missus. -So, how about that coffee? -Or what? You'll shoot yourself? You know, in my field, you see a lot of manipulation. But you? -You're the king! -ls that a yes? What you're doing here is completely, l mean, completely, unfair. lf you have to shoot yourself, it's tragic, but. . . . . .it has nothing to do with me. You hear? l'm not responsible. You're absolutely right. Here's what we're gonna do. . . You're gonna put the gun down and ask for that buck like a normal. . . . . .homeless person, and l'll answer what l answer with no connection to your situation or this gun or anything else. -Okay. -Okay, what? Would you. . . . . .please. . .give me a dollar for a cup of coffee? l'm sorry. lf l give you the money, l'll feel manipulated. l'm just gonna go now, okay? Okay. JlM: Maybe tomorrow.

What are you doing here? l was cleaning the waffle maker. What happened to the interview? DAVE: l didn't get the job. Dave! They said l didn't have the necessary experience. ls that your blood? How much experience do you need for telemarketing? DAVE: That's what they said. -And what did you say? -Thank you, anyway. Thank you, anyway? Didn't l tell you that nice guys always finish last? DAVE: So. . . whose blood is this? JlM: A nice guy. l don't know his name. l have to get to work, Dave. Do you feel like walking me out? MlCHELLE, lNSlDE APARTMENT: Passive-aggressive! What's not to understand? DAVE: Dad, l'm sorry about the interview. RON, lNSlDE APARTMENT: Well, what does it even mean? MlCHELLE: Passive, as in ''even if l live to be 1 00, l'll never wash a cup.'' And aggressive, as in ''l'd rather eat my own nuts than have dinner with your parents.'' Oh, the mouth on her! She reminds me of your mother. [ Elevator engine revs ] l really think you should ask your brother to put in a good word with his boss. lt just seems so embarrassing going into peoples' homes, taking their stuff. You're talking as if he's a burglar, Dave. Repossessing is a respectable job. Yes, still. . . -JlM: Well, just think about it. -Okay. And, in the meantime, l'll go over the mail, vacuum, and cook us dinner. How do cr?pes with cream and truffles sound? Great. l will need 1 0 bucks for truffle shavings, though. l didn't know that truffles shaved. [ Chuckles ] [ Sounds of soccer game come from store display ] Nice move! ZACK: Thank you.

You said you're willing to marry me. lt's not that l'm against it. l just. . . don't think that it's important. [ Sarcastically ] : Marriage isn't important. A baby isn't important. A career isn't important. What goes on in the world isn't important. What is important? Marriage, kids. . . Listen to yourself. You sound like an old maid. Ron, l am an old maid.

MlCHELLE: Look, you seem really nice, for a repossessor. . . Lenny, but l'd rather be alone. LENNY: Why, because l'm a repossessor? [ Truck horn honks, engine revs ] Come on. We're not that bad. We're just like Robin Hood, only in reverse. What's your name? [ Bells on door jingle ] Sorry. MAN lN SHOP: Good morning. What can l get you? -ALBERT: Good morning. -LENNY: An unplanned child?

And when it's full of coins, you'll get your what's-his-name action figure. ls it a deal? l know you're disappointed now, but l'm doing it for your sake. How come? Because in life, you don't always get what you want. You have to work hard for it. Kids who don't learn that grow up to be criminals because they're used to getting everything the easy way. But remember, if you throw up. . . . . .no money. BlSLE Y: Congrats! Who's the lucky bitch? STANTON: Easy, Bisley. Don't insult the man. BlSLE Y: Why insult? l meant a hot bitch. DRAZAN: Where?

Me -- l can't hold a rhythm. . . But my wife -- well, you should have seen her dance! You can't, of course. She died. Hit by a tram. The driver cried like a baby.

You know what they say -- without love, you're nothing. You have a girlfriend? Fianc?e. -She's sexy? -She left me. You know what they say. . . . . .good things never last. [ Front door closes ] [ Phone number being dialed ] [ Telephone rings ] MlCHELLE'S VOlCE: Hi there. lf l can't come to the phone, it means l'm somewhere wonderful, doing something really, really fun. Leave me a message, and l'll tell you all about it, unless it's something really... [ Beep ] [ Sobbing ] Did you hear that? ALBERT: Hear what? How can you people stand living like this? Like how? ANGEL: Cooped up in these tiny flats, hearing what's going on with the neighbors. This is a good-size apartment. Wait till you see the open luxurious spaces in heaven. l don't mind small spaces, but do you think that l will get to see my wife there? Off the record, l don't think so. ALBERT: But why? l don't know. My wife went 1 0 years before me. And since then, l ate so much shit, l tell you. . . But l did my best to be a good person. [ Continues ] : l was sure she went to heaven. l had to do everything l could to join her, and then instead of getting to see her, l got a pair of wings and some perspective. lt is somewhat small. Somewhat? lt's tighter than a sardine's asshole. [ Chuckles ] We can go up onto the roof if you want. The view is nice. [ Continues ] : l used to go up there with my wife to relax. What are you --? What are you thinking about? LENNY: Work. You don't look like someone who's thinking about hauling a refrigerator. -You're thinking about me. -Yep, l was thinking about you. TANlTA: What about me? l don't have the words. l thought you always had the words. -Me too. -Let's start with the details, then. What's your favorite part of my body? Your eyes. -That's corny! -LENNY: lt's true. This isn't working. God, this city is ugly! [ Albert grunts ] What? You've never been to heaven, have you? Can you believe it? They sent me straight here. So, why did you say it was just like the Sunshine Coast? ANGEL: Because l've been to the Sunshine Coast. On my honeymoon. Even their tap water smells nice. Not like this skin rash of a city. But earlier you said it was nice up here. Earlier l had cucumbers on my eyes. Why don't you fly a little? l bet it's very relaxing. No. People might see me. Come on. l'd love to see you flying. Do it for me. [ Clears throat, spits ] That's fine. l bet you can't fly, anyway. Sure l can. l just don't want anybody to see me. [ Pigeon flies nearby ] Oh, look there! Hmm? [ Albert grunts ] So, what do you like about my eyes? [ Angel screams ] [ Angel screams ] You were great in Show & Tell. l wish l knew your name. ANGEL, SCREAMlNG: Kweller! [ Angel screams, thuds on pavement ] Oh! [ Siren wails ] l heard you breathing on my answering machine, you know. [ Scoffs ] You weren't home. You were out at. . . great places doing all sorts of fun things. That was just a message. l'm really sorry. l want to grow up. MlCHELLE: Don't. [ Police dispatch chatter ] POLlCEMAN: You've been very helpful, Sir. JlM: Can l go now? POLlCEMAN: Sure. You had a rough day. HOMELESS GU Y: Hey, buddy, can you spare some change? Go on, mate. Oh, good on you, Bill. Hey, wait! lt's too much! Where are you going? Your driver's license. . . -Excuse me, Officer. -Yes, Sir. l want to confess to the murder of. . . Murder? Wow, l don't even know his name. POLlCEMAN: The angel? That's the thing. He wasn't really an angel. -He was just a liar with wings. -Whichever. He fell from the sky. Case closed. l pushed him. Sir, l've seen it a hundred times before. Whenever there's a corpse, someone always feels guilty. But l am guilty! Are you a believer, Sir? Yes. l'm sure that God forgives you. Have a good night. Careful, Kweller! CLEMENT: You ready for bed? Ah, what are you drawing? That's you, me, and Mom on a boat trip. That's nice. Dad, you're making Kweller nauseous. He's not making any noise, Zacky. You know what that means? Tomorrow you'll get your Soccer Jack action figure. That's great, Dad. Just put Kweller down. You're making him feel bad. [ Clement rifles through tool drawer ] CLEMENT: The big moment has arrived, Zacky. Are you excited? Sure. But what's the hammer for? Well, it's for you. Just be careful. Zack? l'm careful, Dad. -Well, break the pig open. -Kweller?! Kweller? Yeah. Go on. Break it. You deserve the doll. You worked hard enough for it. l don't want Soccer Jack. Kweller is good enough. You don't understand. lt's really okay. lt's educational. Come on. l'll break it for you. Dad! Yes, Zacky? 50 cents tomorrow to put in his back, after the milk, and then we break him. Tomorrow. Another 50 cents. For a rainy day. Yes. A rainy day. [ Telephone rings ] LENNY: Hey, you've reached Lenny's mobile. Yeah, the brand-new, shiny model with the car-gadget thing, so eat your heart out... [ Beep ] DAVE: Hey, it's Dave. lt's after 8:00, and Dad isn't back from work yet. lt's probably nothing. l bet he'll show up soon. Okay, give me a call when you get this. Bye. [ Cell phone vibrating ] Someone left you a message. Uh-huh. What if it's important? lt's not. l love touching you. Just like a baby's bottom. LENNY: What? TANlTA: Nothing. Your eyelash. Then, make a wish. Lenny? Lenny, where are you? LENNY: l'm in the bathroom. ZACK: Don't worry, Kweller. lt's only a tiny jump. We'll do it on the count of three. One. . . ZACK: Three! [ Loud crash ] [ Sounds of soccer game come from store display ] [ Water lapping at edge of lake ] Bye, Kweller. Pigs love parks, especially ones with lakes. You'll be happy here. [ Birds tweeting ] [ Water lapping, ducks quacking ] [ Buzzer sounds ] [ Buzzer sounds ] Dad? MESSENGER: A package for Dave Peck. Thanks. [ Church bells chime hour in distance ] -MESSENGER: There you go. -Thanks. MESSENGER: Have a nice day. WOMAN, VOlCEO VER: Dear Valued Customer, Unfortunately, we are going out of business. Consequently, the book you've ordered, How to Make People Listen, has been out of print for a while. We're reimbursing you $9.99 and sending you a copy of another of our wonderful books. DAVE: Swim Like A Dolphin? Mr. Kweller, let me help you with that. ALBERT: Oh, thank you. Where are you going? l'm going to the Sunshine Coast. DAVE: l'm sure you'll have a good time. Are you going to meet someone there? Maybe. ls everything okay with you? My dad's missing. Ah, l saw him yesterday evening. He gave his wallet to a homeless man. Did you see where he went? Towards the park. [ Does cough joke ] [ Chuckles ] [ Duck quacks ] Dad! Hi, Dave. Come sit next to your dad. Feed the ducks. DAVE: You were here all night? No, no, no. lt was too cold. l slept in a tool shed, and in the morning the gardener came. He gave me some bread. Are you okay? l don't know. l don't know. l remember once your mom and l went to the park to feed the ducks. lt was so much fun. And now l don't feel a damn thing. -Well, maybe the ducks-- -lt's not the ducks. lt's everything. You know, my office -- 30 years, no windows. l know life is supposed to be full of joy and sorrow. lt's just that the joy part-- Don't say that. Let's just do something fun. -Like what? -Anything! There are a million fun things to do! Name one. [ Sniffs ] LENNY: Oh, Smoothies. ''Take the edges out of your life with Dr. Nabotny's revolutionary. . . . . .bone. . . ...removal system. This almost painless technique will smooth. . .'' BEANBAG 1 : Painless? Ha! l wouldn't say painless. You're such a ninny, Max. You're a tough motherfucker now, but l bet when they took out your ribcage, you cried like a baby. BEANBAG 2: The skull is the worst. They pull it through one of the nostrils, you know. No, l didn't realize that, no. lf you're stressing out about the nostril bit and you're not a cheap, whiny wuss, you can pay a little extra, and they just zap it out with a laser. -BEANBAG 1 : Hmm. -Yeah? But even with the laser and everything, why would anyone want to do that? BEANBAGS, lN UNlSON: Love. DAVE: Back and forth, like a whip through the water. Aw, son. . . l don't think it's working. No, Dad, l think you just need to loosen your knees and breathe through the nose. Come on. Try it. Don't you have in one of these books of yours something a little less physical? Yeah, well, l have the one on the meaning of life. l can read from it for you. JlM: Oh. [ Catches breath ] Breathe through the nose. -Wings? -Yes! But he fell like a ton of bricks. You would think someone with wings wouldn't have that problem. You don't believe me? Hon, can you get the cheese? Oh, yeah. Those little matchboxes where you kept your eye drops fell when l took the butter out. -So l threw them away. -What, the beers? No, not the beers, silly. -The bottles you kept in the-- -All three cases? Aargh! -The guys will kill me. -Which guys will kill you? They were imported from Belgium. Ron, l'm sure they weren't beers. -They were eye drops. -How do you know?! Did you taste them? Ron, have you been smoking pot again? One small joint. A really. . . really small joint. [ Door closes ] -STANTON: All three cases? -RON: [ Sighs ] Yup. STANTON: And she really called you ''a delusional fucker''? -l've never seen her that angry. -One expensive lay. l hope it was worth it. [ Continues ] : Fuck the beers. At least now she's gone for good. lt calls for a party. Hey D.J., put something good on! DRAZAN: Ooh, hmm. [ Splash ] JlM: Whoo! [ Dave laughs ] -Oh, did you see that? -Yeah! That wasn't bad!
