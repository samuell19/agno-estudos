- Hey! I was looking for those pot-holders! - They went to a good cause. Oh! I can't believe this. That's right. Sparky, you're the star. - Oh, Victor! - My son is another Hitchcock - Who? - It's that fat guy on TV. Oh no! This is great! That's my boy! Bravo! - Author! Author! - Bravo! - Sparky looked cute. - He's not cute. He's hadsome. - Anybody wants any chocolate cookies? - Oh, that's a good idea! Come on, Sparky. Come on, Sparky. Good boy. - Sparky is a very talented dog. - He is Come here, Sparky, come here. Come on, Sparky. Go get it. - Gonna get another one? - I don't know. Why don't you get a Pekinese, the're so cute. - My parents say I can do whatever I want. - That sound very much sure. I don't know if I can find another one like Sparky. What about a fish? They got a lot of personality. And you get used to dying. ...and so that, class, is what is meant for the old adage 'Rome wasn't built in a day'. All right, class, if you can turn to our science book. We'll pick up where we left off yesterday. If we could go on... Now let me show you on what I mean about electricity and the central nervous system. I'm glad we all have a scientific mind. Now class this ex-frog cannot move because it is in fact an ex-frog. But, let's see what happens when we introduce electricity into the system. Now, with a greater amount of electricity we could make the frog move even more. Any questions? Seems pretty obvious. - Hold on. Hi. - Hi. - Victor, are you OK? - Fine, ma, it is great. - I've got the day off. I'm making your favourite for dinner - Roast beef? - I thought your favourite was chicken. - Chicken is fair, ma. Excuse me. Hi. Victor? Yeah, he seems to be taking it fairly well. Got much homework today? Just some science and a chapter of Huckleberry Finn. - Found what you wanted? - Yeah. - I hope it wasn't the cake? - No. I'm helping my dad clean up the garage. - By bringing it back into the house? - I just do what he wants. Why must I always be the one who puts the cat out. I hope you run into a ten-foot a mouse! - We just want to say good night. - Come in. We want you to know we're proud of how you're getting along. I think I'll be just fine. I'm ten years old already! Well, then you should be able to read right side up. Go back to your science fiction. We won't tell anybody. - We're right down the hall? - First right passed the closet! Did you ever figure out what this thing is supposed to be?? I think it's either a piece of fine art or a paperweight. I don't even remember who gave it to us. My sister gave it to us. Oh. Well, then it must be a paperweight. I don't feel so good. He's not warm. Maybe it was the chicken. Hey, do you want some juice, champ? - Maybe he's got the flu or something - Yes, the flu or something. - Or maybe you just don't feel like going to school. - No, it's the flu or something. We know you're sad, buddy, but you gotta go to school. I can't go! I don't want to affect the whole school. Oh, very noble... Here is your lunch. Now, get the move on. Forgot my lunch! Cheers. It's nothing, Raymond. Let's go home, come on. - Have you seen a dog or something? - It tried to kill my Raymond! Barbie, you are not working hard enough. - What is it? - It's a monster! I'm tired. I got to talk to you about that dog! You know Sparky was hit. We don't have a dog. Look, I don't mind if you have a new dog... ... but you can't let him run aroud scaring half the neighbourhood. But we didn't get another dog! I saw a monster! Look, would it make you feel better if I went in and check for you? Yes. Honey, maybe you just imagined it. I didn't imagine what I saw! And Rose didn't either! It was 6 feet tall and he tried to eat my Raymond! Sparky, you know you're not supposed to go out. You could have got into troubles! I'm sure there is a very logical explanation for all this. Well? There is no dog. It was probably an alley cat or something. That's right, probably an alley cat. All right, all right. But if I see it again I'll be back. What? It was a cat! Look, can we talk later? OK? I know what I saw! Honey, really, sometimes we get frightened... Please, excuse us. It's only Sparky. What do you mean "only Sparky"? I explained everything to you. Honey, I know you explained it. We just don't understand. We're trying to be reasonable, son. Don't you understand the implications of this thing? I just don't know what this means. It means you don't have to bring home another dog. Your mother and I are trying to make some sense of this. You know you haven't patted him yet? See, he still loves you. Other parents are worried about their kids getting into drugs. Yes, we're lucky... and bet it is the best science project this year. I have no idea what to do. It didn't cover this in the mass class. Sparky seems fairly enough. I guess we can't punish Victor for bringing Sparky back from the dead. Ok, Victor, I guess Sparky can stay down here. We got to keep all the blinds closed. He should go out. No, no. He gonna walk out at night, when it's very very dark. - Come on, we gotta both go to work. - Don't worry about Sparky. I'll fix him a nice pool of batteries. Or something. I heard they have a lion in there. I saw it. It's worse and bigger People are weird. They just don't understand. - But Sparky is not scary - I know, they just don't know him. Hey Victor, let's introduce everybody to Sparky tonight. Oh dad, not yet. The longer we'll wait, the worse it'll be. Trust me, we'll have everybody over and we'll let them meet Sparky. I don't know. Go on. - Bye. - Bye. It's the only way out of this. Have a good day. Victor, you won't believe the stuff I've heard about you. We got plenty of it! There. I think that this one is just fine. Maybe we should do it some other time. It's too late for that, Victor. Come on, honey, let's go. Come on, Sparky. So it really is the same old Sparky that we all knew and loved. That's it! It tried to kill my Raymond! Please, calm down! We get to find Victor! Let's go get that thing! Attacked my daughter! It tried to eat my Raymond! Victor, don't go in there! Victor, come down! Victor, are you ok? He saved the kid's life. All right, all right. The kid did it before, we can do it again. - Go get the care. - It's gonna be ok, Sparky. Come on, come on. We gotta save this dog. - Now? - Now. All right everybody. Start your engines. Please, please. Let this work. Give it more juice! It's love at first sight.
