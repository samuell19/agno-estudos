Nothing like what we imagined. They indeed went to temple Hey where did you take her? Shut up and move away! Don't you show your anger to us Mr. Crack pot! How dare you confront my nephew when I am around? I might be short but the machete I wield is long! Wanna try me?! His ex is even taller than him! Wanna try? - I was showing off, why would you do that? - What if he just slaps you? - Stop it with your fun games - Now, watch me You better take him away or else he'll get bashed up Uncle! No bad words! - And you want Biriyani? - No bad words! No Biriyani? No fight! Shut up! No fight! Inspector Saravana Pandian is here to meet you The inspector is here? Did you expect the IG to come and meet you? Come on I totally forgot that the inspector is here The tea is superb So Muruga... I hope you know about the incident that took place yesterday He has murdered the victim by holding him against your vehicle Inspector sir... who said Shivanna committed the murder by holding the victim against our vehicle? The whole village says so Then go inquire the villagers. Don't trouble my nephew We are quietly minding our business We are not disturbing anyone. You know very well about Shivanna We can't live or work in peace by pressing charges against him So none of you will be an eyewitness? Then how will I take action against him? The victim is a post master. An innocent. He has two grown up daughters Have concern for his family If we have concern for his family then we'll have to forget our family We are ready to do anything apart from messing with Shivanna Don't force him to be an eyewitness I request you! Nice! So you don't care about other's life? You just want to lead a peaceful life - This is pathetic! - Inspector sir! Is it ok if I become an eyewitness? What's wrong with her? Are you nuts? Don't you have sense? Didn't I already warn you? I told you why he murdered him. Don't you wanna go back home? Use your brains! Don't act like a fool! Hands off me! Inspector sir, I witnessed the murder. I am not afraid Do you want a written statement or do you want me to say it in the court? Fantastic! This is enough Don't you worry. I'll ensure nothing happens to you Until you are here in this village, myself and my department will give you full security Wait, I'm coming Mr. Uncle, you are not even worth the balls in the billiards Did he just say that you are not even worth the balls in the billiards? Come here. What did he mean by 'Not even worth the balls in billiards?' Wonder what troubles she will invite Muruga! What? Who do you think you are? Don't you have any sense? Excuse me! Don't you talk like that to me! I being patient with you and you are talking too much! What's that stink? Is it his coat? Could it be him? Is the stink coming from him? What are you looking at? Go wash the jeep! It's indeed him! All useless fellows work for me! Who do you think you are? I'm being patient with you and you are yapping away! I know about me very well! Go, check out yourself Villagers say that I look like a young Ajith (famous actor) Does he know that your villagers feel so? He will soon find out He is very smart and has an awesome personality - Don't you talk about personality! - Stop it! Don't you dare talk about my personality What makes you feel you can talk about my personality? - What's the problem here? - Who's that disturbance? I'm coming Uncle, guess what she said! Guess! Guess! Stop it. I was listening all this while There is a small mistake in what she said Look here. Not just here. All over the world... only I am qualified to speak about personality I am a mixture of 'Vallarasu' Vijaykanth and 'Aboorva Sahodharargal' Kamal Hassan Well to be precise, actors like Vijay, Ajith, Arya etc... are nothing compared to my personality Akila, I hope you got all your questions answered You're so short because someone gave you a knock on your head! And if I knock you over that, you'll become further short! Holy guacamole! - So shut! - Shut what? Uncle, a woman is insulting me... and instead of solving this issue like an elder... I guess my nephew is upset Instead you sing praised of your own? Wait, I'll damage your image! Didn't your wife leave you after hating your personality? - Nephew, order! - Yes uncle! Did the food reach the foster home? It'll reach in half an hour - To the oldage home? - Kava Kuchi is on it - To Annai Teresa school? - I'm on it - Then go! - Yes uncle! - Leave! At once! - Ok, I'm going Uh-oh, that sounded rude Should I give you separate instructions? Go to your room - Let me not speak of this incident again - Uncle What is that food service all about? Do you guys run a school? Neither Murugan is a rude guy like you think... nor does he spend time flirting with girls He is rich enough to provide for his next three generations Murugan's parents are the epitome of love and affection With whatever he earns, he pays our salary and... doesn't even take a penny for himself He helps helpless oldage people and poor children with money and things they need He calls me uncle... but I'm not his own uncle Nope When inspector wanted you to be the witness... and when Murugan stopped you, there is a good reason behind it Many like you come here on a tour... they enjoy for few days and go back home But until they are here, Murugan is the one who is restless He'll be at peace only after they reach their home safe Shivanna is a very bad and dangerous person Murugan behaved like that just because he doesn't want him to trouble you Murugan will never be a trouble to you. You can be sure of that Go to your room. I'll send in the food I'm tired of telling Kava Kuchi to take care of the laundry He doesn't do any work! I must kick him out first! I have to do all the chores here! Jai bhajarang bali! You are in the wrong room! I'm in the correct room. This is my room I was taking out clothes for laundry You are still a kid.

Kava Kuchi said you were looking for me What's with all the decoration? Let me guess, it's your birthday right? No? What else could it be? You are a Christian and you are celebrating christmas today. Right? No? - Muruga - Tell me A day where I have found a new version of me A day where I have realized who I am Muruga, you always keep telling that... God does exist Of course, God does exist That too God is on our side Forget that. Guess, what's special today Dry fish gravy and boiled country eggs Fish fry, crab, eel etc. There's a lot on the menu Make it fast or else my uncle will start yelling at both of us. Shall we? Muruga!

I wait for the chance and escape! - Now, watch me! - Muruga! Do you still think it's not true? Come on, I know you city girls I have been to Chennai! Especially girls in software. Let's me not open up about them! They smoke in the broad daylight, go to pubs and drink like a fish City girls keep changing at least three boy friends every year in the name of 'mutual understanding' I know all about it. So, don't think I don't know about it You work in a chit fund company... and I'm sure you would have met many smart guys from the software department And you find someone from here better than them? I'm a villager We just dress so modern when guys like you visit us Whatever you do, do it with dedication If we fall in love, then we love only that girl till the end of our life We don't even think of anyone else And you say you fell in love in three days? I can't believe it I am not the one to fall for it and I don't have time for it Not all girls are the same Who said I fell in love in just three days? It's been fifteen years since I fell in love with you Fifteen years? How? Sounds stupid! Do you know Lotus pond in our village? There is a swing built by it The pupil tree has its aerial roots touching the ground During sunset... a cool breeze flows over there All the kids from village come to play there A small kid named Murugan... another kid named Baby... and another one named Kutty They make paper boats and play by the pond They decide to have dinner at the house of the person whose boat wins the races Jealousy... struggles, sorrow... hatred... they never knew that any of these existed And that Baby is... is me, Akila! Look how fate plays I was searching for you all along when you were by my side This way or that way? Only after meeting your mother... I confirmed that you're the Murugan I'm looking for You look very graceful, dear So happy to have met you God bless you, dear Akila... So, you are Baby? Your parents? Akila... Father has retired from work now And you very well know... mom's a house wife. I'm running the family now By the way, where is Kutty? After that issue, Kutty's family left this village taking him along There's no information about them What Kutty's father did to your family was betrayal How do you still remember me and how did you find me? You are great! Well, even I didn't remember anything The reason is the incident that took place during our childhood But shall I tell you the truth? I always believed that some girl will come looking for me one day God does exist. He is scripting everyone's story just like a movie Only God know when to unite and separate people from each other Just how he united us now A pint of brandy, hot water and some boiled peanuts And a pack of cigarette Shivanna, we thought it was end of our problems But looks like we aren't getting any rest You destroyed the FIR copies in the police station You destroyed all the systems. You said there won't be any eyewitness But looks like they have a new eyewitness now If the eyewitness reaches the court and points a finger at you... you'll be hanged to death for sure! Police has the freedom to do anything against you In fact they can even frame and finish you off They can do it when you're in prison It's their usual method. Haven't you heard of it? If that girl gives a statement against you at the court... then even the Lord Paramasivam won't be able to save you All our efforts and all the murders you committed are a waste Who are those A-Z fellows? Let me ask you this. Don't they know very well about you? Soon we'll start a happy little family of our own We will never find a peaceful life anywhere like here, in our own village Who's that? I'll go check I'll open the door, you just hide Ok. Ok - Thank God - Ayyappa! What is it? There is an issue downstairs Do not open the door. No matter what. Lock it - Do not open until I say - What's the issue? You won't understand Chief, what are you doing here? Captain, what are you doing here? Chief, I was clearing Akila's doubt People are here to clear you off and... you wanna clear her doubts? Excuse me, one step back! Come here, you rascal! - Chief! - Muruga, wait I'm coming Make way Whoa! So he just came here to drink some water? I was afraid that he was here for something else If he had asked, I would have given him water in a bucket Muruga... along with A-Z company of yours... you also take up killing contracts I'll bring the business to you We'll share the profits. What do you say? What are you wondering? That murdering isn't that easy? I'm wondering why are you talking this all of a sudden I don't get it You won't get it. You just won't Yet you will arrange a witness against me and the murder I committed Not our fault, boss Catch this It was this girl, who agreed to be the eyewitness. She did it in a haste - We got nothing to do with it - Stop talking like a fool! Agreed, it's our fault I'll talk to her and ask her to retract her statement He's riled up and you are being smooth? I will decide if she has to retract her statement or not Not you! Where's that girl? - Just a minute. Come here - Come here Now I see why Murugan is getting upset She is one hot chick! Attend the marriage, enjoy the sightseeing... have a good feast and take rest! Why do you poke nose in our business? Please no! Please Shivanna, no! Please! Please, I'll convince her and send her back That's what I warned of. You are from here... If I thrash you, it's an insult for me and you'll be a mess Let me show her who is Shivanna! - Come with me! - Please! Let's talk it out You say, let's talk it out... I say let's finish her off! She is from out of station. Please, forgive her this time Aren't you from here? You should have warned her Why are you feeling now? Guru! Please, she is innocent. Please! Only God understands mercy and innocence I don't know anything about it. If I gotta live, she must die! Muruga! Where are you off to? Come on! - What's going on? - That's Shivanna Wait... here, take this! You baldie! Catch him! Get him! Stop! Muruga, I'll take it from here Hands off me Don't be happy that the police caught me I visit police station like restaurants. I'll go, eat, pay the bill and come out! You are also my enemy from today Even your father poked nose in unwanted matters They chopped him into two pieces I'll chop you into three pieces Before that, I'll get her and... Shut up and keep moving! If she must die then before that I must die! But a minute before I die, I'll take your life! When a merciless migrant like you can be show arrogance... I'm from the Tamil land that shows mercy! I too can show arrogance and that too more than you! Take him away officer! - Put him in the jeep! - Get in! Move! Thank you sir Drive to our station. Time to rip him apart! Muruga... we were having a fun time thinking there was no danger in this village He threatens to chop you down... and you challenge him in return. What's going on? You told me that you father was a school master But he just said that your father was murdered What did you father do, that led to his murder? He did agriculture! He did agriculture? He preached that every bit of our food has the blood and sweat of a farmer's family He taught us that if agriculture and farmers were destroyed then we'll have to migrate for food " Second world war is done and dusted" " There will be a third world war and that won't be fought with weapons or for weapons" " It'll be a war to beat hunger and starvation. A war for food!" He said that! My father wasn't just a school teacher... he was a teacher to this whole society Annaivayal village, Sivagangai district Natesan master In the 1990s he was the go to person for land owners and real estate brokers My father! Our village is a drought ridden village Farmers are dependent solely on rain or water from the dam That year we did not receive rainfall or the water from the dam The village went dry The ponds and reservoirs went dry too Our place which was lush and green once Became a barren land without water Day by day... all the the farming lands became real estate properties The villagers thought that was their end... but a good news arrived Subramani What is the matter? Water from the Vaigai river has crossed the twin bridge Is it? Yes! It will reach our village tomorrow Is it true? Inform everyone Oh holy Goddess Mariamma! If they release the water from Vaigai river tomorrow... He had another good news also I will you offer you a feast my Goddess! That good news was rain Our village had no rainfall for the past two years Seeing the rain after two years, Munusamy was ecstatic My prayers have been answered!

So he threw me out and locked the house It will be helpful if you speak with him Leave it aside. They are from Germany Greetings! They need 100 acre land. I have shown them many properties But they want it in our village Their proposed factory needs a lot of water it seems Even the German's know about our surplus water resources That is why they are here You are a privileged employee of the government The villagers will listen to you It's a 300 million rupee project Our kickback is 3 million rupees I will have 60 percent of it , you 40 percent How is the deal?

I will payback his debt Then it's alright Here, do as he says Thanks! Be on good terms with Vedagiri He may lend money to you later Thanks! Alright I'll leave now Be seated Naidu What is happening? I don't get it I will tell you If it's just a few acres, we can ask the villagers But you are asking for 100 acres You should talk to teacher Natesan about this Don't reveal the fact that you are asking the agricultural land for building factory Tell him that you are going to practice agriculture Then it would be a cakewalk We should sometimes lie to get things done Greetings sir! Be seated Jayaveera! It seems you won't stop teaching this kids english English is also a necessity sir Students!

This friday is a auspicious day We can sign the papers in Sivan temple Teacher sir! You are in a big surprise soon At that time you will know this Vedagiri Sure My father who used to dissect and discern before making a decision... failed to identify Vedagiri's secret plot Vedagiri! You are the man I under estimated you You fooled even the great Natesan teacher He doesn't know the truth yet I told him that it is for agriculture If he finds out about this, it's a problem You can't find us Vedagiri! The German guy needs a land He is going to build a factory and earn in millions The poor farmers are also getting paid So it's a win-win situation for them What is in it for us then? People's blessing Their blessing is not worth a nickel Does it sound fair to you? You told that we are getting kickbacks and we can share 60-40 Yeah! But will it be enough to settle your debts It wont be good enough for you Shall I tell you something You remember what happened today?

It's nothing sir Kutty's dad is going to earn in millions Kutty's dad and the minister were talking inside the house Minister told that they are going to sell our lands to the germans They are going to build a factory in it They are going to deceive our farmers and loot the money That amount is 10 million rupees After that Kutty will be a millionaire, won't he sir? Akhil's childish words made my father rethink everything Tell your survey number Here Greetings sir! Greetings Greetings sir! Greetings sir! Greetings Please come Everything is ready What is going on? I already told you That you are in for a big surprise This is it. I have brought all the officials They will pay a small initial amount now After everything is done, we can settle the mount to the people in full Didn't I told you that I have to discuss with the people? Yeah! But I talked to them as well I have no objection if you pay me good Good! We are ok with that Thanks! Consider it done They are now waiting for your word If you say yes,we can start the registration Time is running out and people are waiting. What you say? The registrar has a lot of other places to go, so hurry Vedagiri! You asked the land for agriculture But I heard they are going to build a factory Sometimes we have to lie for the greater good of the people It's a good thing if our village gets a factory Good thing? The next generation of this village will starve to death. Is it good? Which is a good thing? If you build factories and buildings on agricultural lands... what are you going to do for food tomorrow? Will you eat the bricks and mortar? You think this single factory is going to affect the entire nation? If every person thinks like you, yes the whole nation will be affected Can you think of the state of this country without the farmers and their lands? Enough! Stop your lectures I am also from a farmer family All my ancestors were farmers What profit did agriculture gave us? Can we decide the price of our crops? Can we harvest sugarcane at our convenience? Is government providing us the required water? Don't preach others to run an unprofitable business Farming is not a business. It's my livelihood, my tradition Don't blame the government. As a minister, it's your duty to get us water That's why we have elected you You know how to hide money from the income tax department You know how to launder money to foreign countries You know how to loot people's money but you don't know how to get water for us Who the hell told you that agriculture is unprofitable? The Japanese are doing it in ships The Chinese are demolishing buildings to make farm lands The Americans are selling their yields in our country You abandon farming and plan to eat money for food? Tell me Listen carefully. If world war happens again, it will be for food and water The countries with food will rule the world He decides whether the country without food dies of hunger or not You should all understand that food will be the major crisis in the future Why brother? Why do you want to sell the land that fed you? Our priest advices us to do so So I decided to sell it Why did you do that? You are a God's servant How can you plant such a venomous thought in people's mind? Teachers sir! We did not receive water from Vaigai. Even the rainfall has failed us Government is not willing to help us What should we do now? We had no other choice except to sell it and move on Move on where? Instead of looking at these drought ridden land... it is better to take care of camels in some Arab country You are ready to take care of camels in some foreign country But not ready to take care of your cows in your own land You told you that we don't have water? A foreign company is sucking out several million liters of water from our Thamirabarani river to make soft drinks But we have no water for agriculture The water, the land, everything he is using is our's Only the ingredient he adds in the water is his own He is pillaging our water resource, filling it in bottles and making billions selling it The government has sold all our rivers, mountains, trees They are selling all our natural resources and making money If this continues, they will even pack oxygen in a bag and sell it What are we going to do about it? Vedagiri! Don't try to insult the minister or me Will the registration happen or not now It won't happen now or ever We are going to give a petition to the government stating 'Agricultural land is only for agriculture' We will move to the court requesting to stop this factory Jayaveera! This is complete report of this proposed factory The are going to build a chemical factory which is dangerous to humans Inhaling the smoke from this factory will give you cancer, skin diseases, eye irritation... and numerous other deadly diseases Do we need this abomination in our village? We don't need this We will oppose it We will oppose it Did you hear it? You two crooks planned to con people into selling their land to this factory right? Vedagiri! What is happening? Look at these crooks Are you trying to insult me in front of him? How many days you planned? To insult me in front of the people? You call us crooks? Did you see us steal? What evidence you have? This people consider God's words more than anything This child word is higher than the God's word Akila! Tell it Uncle! I overheard you and the minister speaking 0.2 million rupees per acre This is my negotiation with the germans But we are going to mention only 50 thousand rupees per acre to the villagers Lying is not a bad thing We will pay them a meager initial amount and get everything signed We will assure them that they will get the rest later But we will keep the money and divide it between us Plead guilty uncle. I assure that our teacher sir will not hit you The child has spoken the truth Damn kid You eavesdropped me and now you turn against me? You are wrong Do not blame the kid Blame your intentions I have made a mistake It was a mistake It's not the kid who should be blamed It's you What is wrong with you? Stop this Spare me, this is part of a politicians life I have been in these type of situations many times He got what he deserved You scoundrel You deserve this We don't have our cows nor the money to buy seeds What do you expect us to do sir? My daughter is 35 years old and unmarried My kids are starving The problem is simple. Agriculture is not profitable No farming, no yields No yield, no job for a folk artist like me Then how do you expect me to survive? The villagers donâ€™t have unity If they were together, anything can be done I have spoken to our teacher sir also Everyone from the village has agreed Except one Here they are Sir! Give it to me Ma'am! Mr. Natesan! This is a right decision I need you and your people to sign this I will make sure this will act as a barb wire for the real estate people who enter this land The farmers feed their yield to the people, but they sleep hungry at night What shall we do? We don't have water He doesn't get the right price for his yields Someone somewhere is reaping all the benefits of the farmer's hard work So everyone is afraid to get into farming They are ready to sell their cows and fields Everybody wants a factory but none talks about its ill effects Waste from clothing and other factories are mixed with water and the land... making them toxic and yielding toxic crops... causing various diseases and killing people The farmer tires in his field from sunrise and returns home only in the evening He doesn't have the time to look at the things happening around him If everyone thinks like you, our country will become the food capital of the world The British came to India to buy pepper and elachi At that time we were exporting them. Today we are importing them Our selfish politicians are to be blamed for this I accept this petition. Tell you lawyer to meet me Best of luck Thanks a lot ma'am Good times started for our village after that We received seasonal rains We received lake water too. Farmers were happily farming Vedagiri waited for 6 months to exact his revenge He waited for the right time And came out again Finish him Dad look out Dad! Dad! Careful dad Dad! Stop fighting dad Dad! Got him Uncle! Please let him go Dad! I want a piece of this Sir! Sir! Dad! Dad look at me Muruga! Don't cry You have to stay strong If a father dies in a family... the family will be devastated But... if a farmer dies, the whole nation will be devastated All the farm lands... are being transformed to factories or housing properties We should stop this You should do it Don't listen to these simple minded fools They just want to live for today They don't have concern for their next generation This little girl... has saved our village from a great danger You should protect her with all your might Ok dad Don't worry for dad Everything you read, every path you take... in the nature around you. I will be there in everything Dad! I will be there Factories and buildings showed up in all our surrounding villages But farming was alive in my village... because of my father After that incident my parents became more concerned The villagers also warned us about our safety This place and people are not suitable for this kid to grow You should leave this village immediately She has crossed a big obstacle in life She has another big obstacle at the age of 22 If she can cross that obstacle... she has a long life Is there any remedy for this? You have a lot of time left Lot of years left The God which placed this obstacles will also provide you a solution Have faith in God and hope only for the good Firstly vacate this village You! Priest! Don't ever try to step into this village again That made us even more scared The consequences will be deadly So we had to separate from Murugan and our village When they informed me about Annaivayal visit I was overjoyed I eagerly went to see our village and Murugan again But never expected I would start a problem Muruga! You think we are living a good life? The life your dad lived was a good life Until now we were thinking about us that we are great than others. You made us realize our foolishness Your father who said that the farmer who feeds people should not experience hunger He is a real human being People who appear on the screen with make-up and act... They are not the real heroes The farmer who starves himself to feed the rest of the world... He is the real hero We don't know the face of the man who cobbled our shoes The weaver who provides us the clothing... We doesn't know his name These unknown and unrecognized people who work for our well being tirelessly... they are the real heroes We people hail and hearty here... but the farmer worked day and night... tirelessly... to send us grains, fruits and everything for us to survive Has anyone stopped a second to think about the farmers? This village is happy now because of your fathers sacrifice and good deeds Fate has brought you and Akila together I am feeling very proud Muruga! You don't worry You Shivanna! Come let's fight it out Vengal rao! Bring that broomstick Fashion Babu, Sambar Shakila, Briyani Beer Mohammed Bring all the utensils and vessels. Let us teach him a lesson Yes! Let us do it Let me do it. You step back Forgot the beatings? Dangerous girl Dude! I am that Kutty they are talking about You are the son of that villain Vedagiri? Yes My father went to jail after that incident He committed suicide inside Our days of gloom started after that The village stamped us as the killers We left the village overnight We moved to Chennai None of our relatives were ready to accept us When we were starving... some guy came and helped us He was a drunkard He beats my mom and sister in front of my eyes We withheld all the pain to survive He will throw me and my sister out and lock the door I have had many sleepless nights My father was responsible for all this If he was alive, we would not have gone through that One day, the drunkard passed away I inherited all his wealth I forgot the past and studied well I took good care of my mom and sister I completely erased all those painful memories But fate has brought me to the same village where it all started Why did I meet Akila? Akila and Murugan are also responsible for my miseries God has assigned me to end their lives Don't do anything stupid or else your life will be miserable again You thought I am a fool like my dad I am a educated criminal You won't see me coming Before they find me out... they will be dead Bro! Bro! Yo! I am aware that you are the postmaster's daughter But you never mentioned your father's name as Subramani My instincts told me that you are my daughter-in-law on our first meet itself Sometimes our instincts become true That is a fact Mom! I beg you Don't make Akila cry Is this how you eat? Look at how they eat Mash it properly Open your mouth wide, swallow it Ya eat like that You feed her mom How was the food? Get in the vehicle I'll leave now Muruga! Take her to our Dharmarja temple If Akila has found us now it must the work of our God Dhroupathiamman What a caring mother! Bye!

I will definitely catch him Ok! Don't go anywhere alone without informing me Ok Sir I'll leave now Who's that? I was the one who informed you that Akila and Murugan were at the market May I come? Come on Reason? I don't like it! Only those who fail in love knows real pain How about that?! When you love a girl with all your heart... and when she goes around with some other guy... I cannot explain the pain that it gives I just found out that Akila is the daughter of my enemy And Murugan is my enemy's son! Now, this is new!

But Murugan is no more! He left you forever Who said Murugan is no more? Murugan is always with me. In fact he is here with me right now! Muruga! Muruga, come here The Butterscotch chikku flavor... is it Murugan's favorite? No. It's my favorite My favorites are Murugan's favorite too Akila... in the little time we spent together, we fought... we discussed a lot We argued a lot In fact you even spoke things that I didn't like Yet I like you I only love Murugan Ok? So far 18 grooms have come to visit me And I have explained each of them about my flashback and they understood I hope you'll understand too Come, let's leave Hey! Akila Akila Hey! Akila! The world is racing away... and people are running behind a life that they believe is good Ask the people who are racing to stop... and think! Ask them to think if the life that we all are living has a meaning Ask everyone who are in love... to answer from the heart... Ask any one who has been in love... if they are happy and have forgot their past love True love happens only once And only with one person Akila! Akila! Boss, don't you worry I'll go convince her. Don't you lose hope Hey Akila! Stop! What are you up to? If you keep rejecting all the grooms... then whom will you marry? This groom looks smart like one of those serial artists The bride is already fixed for him Who is it? My mother You mother? My mother likes him a lot it seems and already my parents keep fighting all the time So I'll ask her to better divorce my father and... - ask her to marry this fellow - Shut up! Shall we go to our favorite place? - Where? - Hop on Those seven days I spent with Murugan... my trip to Annaivayal, the words of those saint coming true... and Murugan sacrificing his life to save mine My parents aren't aware of any of these My friends have confronted me a thousand times... asking how am I gonna live alone, all my life I have only the same reply to all of them I'm still living with Murugan Not just me... all those who love someone truly... Like a wife who lost her husband... a girl who lost her boy friend, a mother who lost her son... Ask all of them " My husband just came and left again" " My boy friend just dropped me off in his bike" " My son is at work" They'll give such answers Such people are not mad or retard Such people live cherishing the memories of their relationship There are millions of such secrets inside a woman's heart Wonder how many of them understands it Whatever I wish... is what Murugan will do We are made for each other
