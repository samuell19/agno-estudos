The executive board meeting broke up 45 minutes ago, Mark. Where were you? I was auditioning for a male whore house in Reno. Well, there's gotta be some way I can make more money than the girls I photograph. You don't have the body for it. Well, speaking of bodies. How much cleavage you want in these shots? I don't think that every edition needs to have cleavage on the cover. How about months with Rs in 'em? What? You know. When it's safe to eat oysters, it's safe to show your pearls. Mark, you're not working for those sex gazettes anymore. Ultra is a magazine for the unpossessed woman. We're trying to establish the perimeter of. Parameters? Parameters of a new lifestyle. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. Just give me the girls and the tickets, huh? Spare me the pointy platform. Okay, Mark. Here we go. This one is Barbara. She's quite a catch for us. She's already got a name. And this is Claire. Very flexible. She'll give you any look that you want. Yeah, I know them both. Who's the third one? Uh-uh, Diane. Now, you know what a pain in the ass she is. Mark, do you have any professional reservations against Pamela or is it that you just don't want to work with a model that you've already laid? I want to work with a girl who can smile without showing her fangs. Mm-hmm. Trust me, I'll find one. All right. You have until six o'clock. Okay. He said it was right on top. Would you hold these while I keep digging? Donuts and hairspray don't mix. Hey, kid. Are we ready yet? Just a minute. Oh, that's nice. Now, put your foot back a little bit. Mandy, where's my goddamn bracelet? Hey, Mandy, sweetie. Can we get a move on, please? It's getting chilly out here. That's an arm bracelet. For Christ sakes, I want an ankle bracelet. What's the difference? What's the difference? I can't swim! I'm sorry, Mark. I guess I really blew that shot. You have no business being behind a camera. Only in front of one. I wonder what I'll lose. Every time I go on location I lose something. Well, yeah. The last time I was in Hong Kong I lost my. - Hi. - Hi. Barbara. You look more stunning than ever. Did you see the beach shots we took? Oh, no. - Hey. - Hey. How's my favorite method model? I'm fine. I've been taking singing lessons. Really developing my voice. You know, as a model it's the one thing I never really got to use. Yeah? You could've fooled me. Oh. Here comes Mandy. Come on, Mandy. Get a move on. Mandy, this is Barbara and Claire. - Hi. - Hi. Isn't it exciting? We'll be in Hong Kong tomorrow. Oh, but we lose a day, don't we? So, we'll be there yesterday. Run in and check your things. Will you, Mandy? Look, I know she's a bit weird now, but when I'm finished with her, she'll be great. Oh, have I heard that one before. Well, here we are. Got it, boss. Barbara, are these all yours? You never know what you'll need. I sure didn't. I thought they gave you everything. No, that's our job. Come prepared with two of everything. The only thing I have two of is shoes. I guess I have a long way to go before I become a famous model like you. Oh, I'm not famous. There probably aren't six models in the whole world who are recognizable on the street. I'm just happy to be making a good living. I'd be happy to be making a bad living. Well, you have nowhere to go but up. Okay, okay. We're gonna work around the live Mirano show tomorrow, so it's gonna be a pretty full three days. With no rehearsals? Have you seen my makeup case? It's in my room. Claire, this is Juanita. She'll help you with your fittings. Barbara, you and Mandy get your wardrobes together while Claire and I shoot. Claire, are you with me? Body and soul. When do you want me? Hey, two o'clock at the terrace. Now, look back at me. Good. Okay, over here now. Okay, start again. Higher, it's a long shot. Hands up. Pretty smile, pretty smile. Good, that's it. That's fun. Who are you? Who? Isadora. Isadora? Yeah. If you're Isadora, why not take it off? All of it? Yeah. What do you think of this new lingerie line? Oh. Well, what kind of shots do you want? Well, I know the guys who made it up. They've been hit pretty hard by the no-bra look. That's too bad. Well, to cheer 'em up, I'd like to give 'em a blow up of the no-bra look. You know, just a little in-joke between us all. How about it? Oh, the no-bra look, huh? What do you mean? Me with, or without, a bra? Oh, come on, Claire. You're a big girl now. All the top models bare a little breast now and then. It's just a boost for the guys in the business. Well, if you want to give the guys in the business a boost... Why don't you model this? Yes. Hmm. Yeah, I like it. Thanks. Juanita. I think it's a bit tight in the bust. Well, we can fix that. I'm going shopping. You wanna come? Oh, no. I think I'm gonna take a long hot bath, but I can give you some advice on what to get. Oh, yeah. I need some new things. Always buy the best you can afford. Go for good materials and sound workmanship. The more different looks you can give them, the more work you'll get. Start with classic, simple lines. Figure out what works for you and what doesn't. Concentrate on accessories and darker neutral colors. Invest in a few good pieces of costume jewelry. Go for quality, not quantity. Try to resist impulse buying. You'll always regret it. How did the shooting with Claire go? Oh, fine. We finished early. She had a couple of ideas I really didn't go for. She said the same thing about you. Well, Professor Higgins. Here comes your Eliza. Hi. Hi. Hi? Hi. Do you realize I've been waiting for an hour to work with you? What do you think this is a vacation? No. Do you remember we have a live presentation of the Mirano Collection tomorrow? Yeah. Do you think you're ready for that? Oh, yes, Mark. Oh, no, Mandy. No? Tada! Oh, my god. You look like a walking garage sale. But these are my authentic Oriental accessories. Authentic Oriental crap is what it is. I'm sorry, Mandy. But I sold you to Diane as a great new talent and you've just gotta come through, okay? Huh? Let's try it again. Come on. Okay, give me a hip shot. Good, higher. Now, innocent girl. Smile sweetly, sweetly. Good, now vogue. Turn around. Remind me to teach you how to do a pirouette. Raunchy, sexy. Oh, Mandy. Jeez. Look, Mandy. If you want the world at your feet, you're gonna have to be standing up, huh? And now presenting our guest models from the USA. Our first model is Mandy Clark. Mandy is wearing a pleasant peasant summer outfit in bold, geometric prints highlighted by a flouncy pink bare midriff. Excellent for those hot summer days. Claire Lewis in a dramatic black ensalm with floor-length fringes. And as you can see, a daring side slit. Next on the ramp is Barbara Cooper in a passionate red evening gown with cross halter straps at the back. Highlighted by a striking Chinese dragon motif. And now we have Claire again wearing a gossamer red chiffon gown with beaded shoulder straps and a pleated skirt. And for our finale, Mandy in a simple outfit for complicated situations. String straps on a beaded bare midriff in a delectable aqua color. There you have it, ladies and gentlemen. Victoria Mirano's summer collection. Thank you very much and goodnight. That was fine, sweetie. I'm getting ready for the party. Hey, I'll wait for you in the lobby, okay? See you later, gorgeous. Mr. Mark Davidson? Yeah. May I introduce myself? I'm Peter Lai of the Cosmic Camera Company. We're very proud to have one of the best fashion photographers in Hong Kong. Well, thank you. My card. May we invite you to our office tomorrow? We'd like to present you a small gift. It's a new model. I'm sure you'll find it very interesting. Well, thanks. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Mark, I think I'm wearing this to the party. Excuse me. You can't wear it out. It's forbidden. Oh, please, Juanita. I promise I'll take care of it. Please, I'll lose my job. Mark, tell her it's okay. No, no, it's okay, Juanita. But, Barbara, make sure you bring it back tomorrow 'cause, you know, we have to send it to Singapore, okay? Hey, Mandy. The car is waiting. Coming. Hello, Kulik. Yeah? She's taken the dress. We'll take care of it. I thought a model had to watch her figure. No, the men she meets do that. That's a great looking dress you're wearing. Oh, thank you. Great looking tie. Thank you. How long will you be in Hong Kong? Oh, maybe another 24 hours. Well, I'm a travel agent. I can show you around. Oh, well. Thank you, but I like to do my own exploring. There must be something I can do for you. Yes, you can get me another drink. Have this. Thank you. Have a sandwich. A sandwich. Oh. What do you want? Have one of these. What do you want? How about myself. Well, what do you want, huh? I need some air. Ladies, I'd like you to meet Mr. Mark Davidson. He's the official photographer of the Marino fashion show. Hello. How do you do? I'm sorry, I'm not interested. No. Ms. Cooper, somebody downstairs would like to talk to you. Excuse me. Oh, sure. See what happens when you leave without saying goodnight? I'm really sorry I was so awful at the party. It's just that I don't like men chasing me around just because I'm a model. It was nothing personal. What's wrong with getting personal? Level your head. Just look right across at that picture frame. Right. Now, angle your wrists in slightly. Yeah, good. That's more like it. Don't worry, these are test shots. We ought to try that high-fashion nude now. It's going so well. Oh, yeah. That's scheduled for our last session. It's more difficult to bring off. Baroque nude. Something like this. Yes, very vogue. Oh, wait. The pants are too much. What do you have on, bikini pants? Okay, take off the pajama pants. Mandy, you'll never make it as a model until you learn to react like a woman, not a teeny bopper. I know what you mean. I want you. Ray? Good morning. You look great. Make it snappy, will you? We gotta get out of here. Hey, do you need any help? Yeah, coffee. Juanita, I'm afraid there's a little seam rip. Sorry. Yeah? The microfilm is not in the dress. What? Can't be. Check it again. I'll be right over. What innocence. Don't make fun of poor Mandy. Were we ever that naive? You know what she said to me this morning? She said, "I'm so lucky to be working "with an artist like Mark. "I mean, there's always something on his mind." Yeah, I'll say. Chicks and bread. Okay, okay. Let's go, Ms. Burnhart. Come on. You too, hot lips. Come on. Kulik. What's the big idea, Juanita? I could've sworn it wasn't there. Ms. Cooper, I have a message for you. What time is it? 5:30. I need the car keys. Have a nice time. Hey. A simple job. Two of you against a girl. It happened so fast. For anyone who thinks so slow, everything is fast. Get out! Trail that girl. I want to know who put her up to it. And I really think something should be done about it. Was anything stolen from you? No. Were you physically assaulted? I told you. Two men tried to kidnap me. Were you sexually assaulted? Not today. I was last night. I went to a party and I went out to the terrace for some air and these two Chinese-looking men tried to rape me. The same men? No, it was a different bunch of men. Ms. Cooper, have you had this sort of experience before? I mean, do men follow you a lot? I should've known better. Mention the word rape and your entire case falls apart. I've either imagined it or asked for it. Well, I've got a witness for you and you write this name down. Ray Chua, Small World Travel Agency. And if you don't call him, I will. Claire, do you think to get to the top a model needs something ugly about her? What? Well, Lauren Hutton had a gap between her teeth. Twiggy is freaky thin. So obviously, you've got to draw attention to your weak spots. You don't need to, babe. Yours are obvious enough. What are you doing? I'm making the most of what I've got that's different. That's not going to work. It's not? Not unless you want to be the first photographic model to feature blackheads. Oh. Mark, look at this place. And that bastard at the embassy thinks that I'm a nut. I wonder what he'd say if I said there was a burglar in my room? He'd probably say you enticed him. Bam, and then slap you with a 9-15. That's for leaving things in your room. Should I call the police? Well, if you're not hurt I wish you wouldn't. We gotta shuffle off to Singapore tomorrow and a thing like this could really hang us up. I wish I could get ahold of Ray. Passengers from flight 310 arriving from Hong Kong may pick up their baggage at carousel number two. Mr. Melson, how long are you staying in Singapore for? I'll be about two months, I guess. When do you start shooting? Soon as I can find the right leading lady. Ms. Tracy Marks here is gonna be working with me on this picture. She's in charge of location hunting. Sammy, let's split. My car's ready. Excuse me, gentlemen. Thank you. But, sir, this is illegal. Don't worry. It's here. Grab the sleeve. Good, then we can make delivery. For your trouble. Hold it. Okay, thanks, Barbara. Hey, Claire? Okay, that's good. Now, I have another idea. How about that? A profile shot with the pendant and earring swinging forward as you reach toward the water. Oh. That way nobody's gonna be looking at the jewelry and you know it. It's just a stylized nude shot for jewelry, Claire. What you're talking about is a tit shot, pure and simple. Not if it's for Harper's or for Ultra. That's what I like about you, Claire baby. You're a model with a mind of your own. How about a dinner tonight? So long as it isn't topless. You rat. Here's your drink, miss. Oh, thank you. Oh, hi, Mark. Wanna share my Deep Sea Diver? Whatever it is, I need it more than you. Don't you like the shots we've been getting? We, my sweet hippy child, have a long way to go. Can we go somewhere tonight? Um... Well... I mean, you've got a lot of work to do. We'd better go. Come on. Send the bill to my room. Is there a number where I can reach him? All right, thank you. The agency said he's here in Singapore checking out an itinerary and there's no way I can get in touch with him. Well, I know what you should do. Tell the Hong Kong office that you're a client and that Ray arranged your whole trip. And that if he doesn't call you, you'll sue. Oh, no. I couldn't put him on the spot like that on his job. Well, I'm sure there's a Small World office here. Why don't you go down there in person? That ought to do it. You've got a short waist and a fat ass. I'm putting you on a diet right now. How can I have a fat ass? My hips are only 34. Mandy, I'm telling you. Your ass is a pain in my neck. It sticks out. It ruins the line. Here, look. I want you to look at these. Copy them, huh? Work on yourself until you can give me every one of those poses. Makeup, hairstyle, the works. And take this rag you love so much and figure out how to make it look like something. Will you help me? Mandy, I've got my own work to do. Where do I start? That's easy. Get down on the floor and do some exercises to get rid of your fat ass. Go on. Now. I wanna hear your ass bumping good and hard on the floor, okay? And in case you're thinking of playing hooky with a Deep Sea Diver tonight, I'm locking you in your room. Thank you. Here's to you, sweetie. I'm really hungry. What's good? Well, how about oysters. Or shark's fin soup? Or artichokes? Okay. Or fish with seven ingredient sauce? Or truffles? Or chocolate? Are you looking at the same menu I am? Those are my favorite aphrodisiacs. Hey, isn't that your favorite tourist over there? Yeah. May I take your orders now? Can I? What are you up to now, babe? Advancing my career, I hope. Would you please take that over there to him? Thank you. Hey, stick with me, baby, and I'll make your adorable puss a household name. Name for what? Mr. Melson? A note from the lady. A love note, huh? Is that all, sir. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'd like you to meet Tracy Marks. No relation to Groucho. We were just going across the street to check on a little disco. Why don't you kids join us? Yeah. Well, we appreciate it, Mr. Melson. Oh, call him Sammy. Okay, Sammy. We've just ordered dinner, so. Oh, I'd love to, Sammy. That's great. I'd love a brandy. Hey, why don't you join us when you're through. I'll get you. Hi. I came to help you with your homework. How did I get to be teacher's pet all of a sudden? You know what, Mandy? I've changed my mind. I think you have a great ass. Hey. I only come down on you so hard because I want you to be a success. You know that, huh? What's wrong? I don't want you to think I'm using you to just get ahead. I hear some girls do that kind of thing. Goodnight, Mark. They have sensational locations here. Tracy's been a big help, too. She really knows this part of the world, huh? Yeah, her father's with the American Embassy. Does she speak the language? I don't know, but she's great with the local contacts. Sam, are there any interesting parts for women in your movie? Oh, yeah. The lead is a hell of a part for a good actress. Well, what's the story? Well, when we first see her, she's a kind of a bar girl. This is set in the '40s, see? Then we find out she's got her own business, Adventures Incorporated. She sets up completely convincing fantasy adventures for wealthy clients. Yeah, she's kind of like Tracy, too. Sam, have you cast that part yet? It's tough to find an actress with the right looks and that kind of range. Well, how about me? I mean, I've had some training. Honey, this is the lead. Well, can you just let me read for it? Claire, you're a beautiful girl. You're a fascinating girl, but you're a model. Models don't make good actresses. Claire, I'm not done yet. Sorry, but I've gotta talk to you. I met Sam Melson last night and he's out here scouting locations for a new picture. And there's a great part for a new young actress. And did he tell you to send in a picture, and a resume, and he'll call you? Barbara, I gave that son of a bitch the time of his life. I make him laugh, I loosened him up, we had dinner, we went to a disco. And after all that, you know what he tells me? That he's got a headache, he's tired. No. He says that a model can never be an actress. He won't even let me read for the part. Says that I'm just another pretty face. Well, what does he know? I'll show him. Hey, how's it going? Mark hated everything I bought, so I'm throwing it out. Well... Hey, would you mind if I borrowed some of these and took 'em? No. I have a date with Sam tonight and it would be really great if I could look the part. I want to really impress him with my acting. Would you happen to have a really raunchy skirt to go with this? Okay, well, thank you. If you want to be extra sure, I've got two of everything. Yes, ma'am. May I help you? Yes, I'm a personal client of Ray Chua's. And something's gone very bad with my arrangements and it's very important that I get in touch with him. Oh, I'm sorry. He's out of town. Well, when do you expect him back? I have no idea. Oh, okay. Thank you. Hey, have you seen Sam Melson? No, ma'am. Hey, come on. Take your business somewhere else. I run this joint. I'm meeting a friend. Well, get a move on. Hiya, baby. What? Now, wait, wait. Let me do that. Here we go. Here, here. Here, here. Here. Here. Ow! Excuse me. Excuse me. No, no, no, no. Oh, shoot. Wait a minute, will ya? I've made up my mind. I'm gonna quit smoking. Ooh, fire! Hmm. One if by land and two if by sea. Yeah. It's a rough life. Huh, sailor? Not even a porthole to put your oar in. How about you, baby? If you want me just whistle. If you know how to. Where you going? Come on, baby. What are you doing over there? Come on, over here. Come on, baby. Where are we going, the john? No, not the john. Come on. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? Come on, cut it out, will ya? That way. Stop this rig! Come on, stop that rig! Hey, you! Hey, you! I want to talk to you! Come on down! Hey, you! Come on! Come on. Can't you go faster? Faster. Damn you! Get down from that rig! Get down, come on! I want to talk to you! Get out of there! Get down, come on! I don't want to see your face here again! Let's get the hell out of here. Well, how was I supposed to know he was a cop? 500 lousy dollars it cost me to keep you out of wherever they send hookers. Boy, if we didn't have to shoot today, I'd have left you there. Boy, oh, boy. You do look like hell though. All I need is a couple of days sleep and a month in Acapulco. Oh, Mark. I'm sorry. I mean, I got a date with Sam and I figured if I came on like a real hooker and he fell for it, I'd get the part in his movie. You know, if Diane ever found out about this, we'd both be out of a job. Yeah, I know. I got carried away. There were these three men, two sailors and a marine, and they were. Big. And... Anyway, I always wondered if I could handle three men at once. You think you can handle one? Well, you paid your 500 bucks. Well, you better be worth it. Oh. Claire? Excuse me. Hey, Mandy. Where are you going? What kind of a question is that? I told you. This is ridiculous. I will not agree to any cheap shots. I am the number one fashion model in the Far East. You are the number one pain in the ass in the Far East. It's horrible. I am through. I resign. You? You are under contract. I'll tear it up. I don't care. Remember, I made you the top model of the top magazine in the Far East. I can make anyone a top model. I can make anyone a top model. You. You, come here. Come. I'll sue you. Taxi, taxi. Ray? Compliments of that gentleman there, Ms. Marks. I don't mean to keep bugging you about this, but you can get into a lot of trouble impersonating an ambassador's daughter. What the hell are you trying to do, get arrested again? Will you lighten up? I mean, it's a free drink. I just hope you realize you're passing yourself off as a nymphomaniac. What? Tracy Marks, the ambassador's daughter. She was busted last year on a dope smuggling charge. And then it came out she was under psychiatric treatment for severe sexual disturbances. Just because she's young, and wealthy, and smokes cigars doesn't mean she's a nymphomaniac. It's a product of your fevered imagination. Phone call for you, miss. Who is it? Sam Melson. - Oh, my god. - Where do I take it? At the foot of the stairs. Oh, all right. Hello? Oh, yes. I love to. Come on! Let's go. Okay, that's it. You seen Claire this morning? No. Maybe she slept late. That's just like her. I don't think we're gonna find a better time or place than this. For what? The nude shot, remember? Claire and Barbara both gave me nice shots, but you're special. I fell in love with you when we met in LA. You know, every photographer has his dream subject. And you're mine. Well, what do I wear? The 49th most luxurious G-string in the entire world. Want one? No thanks. I got your brand for you. They're not cheap, you know? Did you have a nice nap? The bugs are eating me alive. Maybe you'd prefer my bed, huh? It's nice, and warm, and no bugs. There may be a little snake. If you're trying to be funny, forget it. If you're just gonna be disgusting, you might as well. You love it. Look, don't play innocent with me. You're going to write a little note to your father. My father? He's dead. You're going to write to your father at the embassy. Now. Oh, this is incredible. Jeez. Start writing. What do you want me to write? Dear Daddy, the gooks have got me. Please, send the marines. Love, Claire. Shut up. Write I'm a captive of a people's liberation army. Due to the many social injustices perpetrated by your country, the just leaders of the PLA demand the ransom of $50,000. Well, her bed certainly hasn't been slept in. She didn't say anything about meeting that gorilla of a director, did she? No. And her clothes and everything are still there anyway. You lying bitch. You tricked me. You're not Tracy Marks. I never said I was. Playing can get you in a lot of trouble. You like playing at being a bad girl? Oh, hi. Come in. No, don't bother, baby doll. It'll only take a minute. I've got the prints here of that pictorial we had and they are sensational. Thank you. The editors of my magazine have seen them and they're dying to use them. What do you say? Sure, why not? One of these days, baby, whether you know it or not, you are going to be my top signature model. Howard, you're very kind, but I'm tied up with my photographer Mark. He's done so much for me. We'll see. Any word from Cosmic Camera? No, sir, but I have a package for you. You bastard. Those shots were never for Ultra Magazine at all. They're for some cheap centerfold. Oh, come on, Mandy. It's not such a big deal. I bet you gave the same line to Claire and Barbara, too. Huh? Well, I'll have to admit, they weren't as cooperative as you were. I suppose that's why I'm your favorite model. Come on, Mandy. I'll cut you in on the deal, okay? I'll give you half of what I'm getting from Swinger. That's more money than you'll make on this entire trip. You think I'm dumb enough to fall for that? Well, you're crazy if you don't. Swinger's not just a girlie magazine anymore. They have respectable writers. Creative, influential people subscribe to it. Claire saw the sense in that and so did Barbara. And they're professional models. If Diane ever heard about this, you'd be blackballed. Hey, you wouldn't... God. Relax, Ms. Cooper. No violence intended. We want to talk business with you. What? A small item worth $200,000. The microfilm, please. Oh, I don't know what you're. Please, Ms. Cooper. Please. Ms. Cooper, you may go now. Mr. Tillman from the embassy has bailed you out. Listen, if you need a lift, I can drop you at the hotel. Yes, I do. Tom Mahoney, CIA. We've cleared you of the charges against you here, but you've put me in a real spot. CIA? I thought the only secrets I exposed were my own. You modeled a Marino dress in Hong Kong which contained a strip of microfilm. It contained a list of all the red Chinese agents operating in the Far East. You also met a Ray Chua. Is he a spy? No, he's an undercover agent for us. His job was to get ahold of that film and make a copy of it without the reds knowing it. But before he got a chance to return the microfilm, you walked off with the dress. Well, I certainly couldn't walk off without it, could I? Well, he solved that problem by going back to your room later. So that's why I was attacked. They thought that I had the film. Only it wasn't the reds that tried to get you. They're Taiwanese. Both at the Hong Kong party and again at the poolside. What was that again? The Taiwanese. They want that film, also. Well, don't they know that you have it? At this moment, it's immaterial. You see, according to our latest information, the microfilm that Ray copied is a fake. The real list is here in Singapore. It's being delivered tomorrow. Ray must know this. He's in charge of the mission and he's been uncovered. And why are you telling me all this? We need you. Well, what can I do that you can't do? Well, you're the only one that can get to him without arousing suspicion. I really appreciate you sticking your necks out for me. Well, you need help. Hey, I know just the perfect man. Do you think we should ask Mark? No, we don't have time. Where is Number One? Sir, the helicopter's here. As you already know, Barbara Cooper is clean. Ray Chua is the double agent. Take care of him. Your man is late. But I was talking to him only this morning. I sent Ming to take him over. Okay, I'll go check. Mr. Chua, some Americans looking for you. Ray? Let them in. Not here. Ray, we've been looking everywhere for you. You have to show us those locations. Boy, it's really beautiful here. I do not wish to be impolite, but you must leave. Can't we even just look around? Perhaps another time. Sir, he's here. What the hell are you guys doing here? The camera, please. Sure. I think you're gonna like that lens. By the way, you're welcome. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Please, let me explain, okay? I'm an American, you understand? I have to go to Los Angeles. You know where Los Angeles is? Very big city. United States, you understand? Huh? Okay, so I have to go. So, you understand? You have the wrong man, okay? You can explain at the station. Oh, no. And that's how I got involved. Well, thank you Ms. Lewis for your account of the shootout. Is it true that you were also a kidnap victim in a bizarre case of mistaken identity? Yes, I was. Should I tell you about it? Were you sexually assaulted? Well, I had to prove that I was a nymphomaniac. Otherwise, they probably would've killed me if they found out I wasn't. That is, wasn't who they thought I was. You must've put on a very convincing act. Print that. Claire. I've been thinking after all this about you in my movie. It's a great part. I have a hunch you've got what it takes for this role.
