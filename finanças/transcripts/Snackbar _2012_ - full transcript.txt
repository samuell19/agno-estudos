Oh my Allah, my pain won't end like this now that my beloved has left me my heart has renounced love even if You were to give me a thousand lovers it doesn't matter anymore. I roll them as if they were factory made. Look with my eyes closed. Mine is decent too. - Look, with my eyes closed. I'm not looking, right? Without looking. Did I get it, or not. I only have to lick. This is our street artist. When you leave, insert a euro. I want fries, because Biggy is confused. I'm pure and I come from the mountains. - Ah, fries. He's nuts. Check out that face. I have to be left alone I want to be a father some day I have so many questions but where are the answers? I let my hands do the talking, because I won't follow you I take care of myself I live today and hope for tomorrow. End of song. Action, action. Nicely on the chest. Come on. Hamza. - What do you want? Fries and a drink. - Hamza, A A drink. Did I win the lottery, or something? Come on, it's done. Can I order something? - Of course. What do you want? Let's see.

I'm betting. - On whom? Nouredine is going to win, anyway. Chiwawa! Hey, Ali. - Good morning. I'm going to have a smoke. Do you want a kiss? - No. Come here. - Go away. You wanted a kiss. - Just kidding. Chiwawa wants a kiss. Give me a cigarette. - You have a machine full of them. Heertje. Nice suit, man. - I hate that dude. Get off that car. Yuck, what a show-off. - But those shoes... What ah out them? - They don't match the rest. Is that so? Just worry about your chip shop, Ali. Queer. Must have spent an hour on his hair. He thinks he's got a Bentley. - Infidel dog. For sure. - Really. He's a tramp. Why? - He was nearly in the shredder. In the what? - In the shredder. That thing... Do you know it? - What happened? What do you think travellers would do with you? Play cards? They put him in the shredder, and fed him to the pigs. The teeth are all that's left. Hey, Dries. - Hey, Ali. Read that. - Travellers are weird, man. Fries from Ali. Good job. Listen. Those dudes won't get to heaven. Trust me. What are you talking ah out? - They've been eaten by pigs. Listen to him. - Right. He means it too. - He really means it. Go and have a smoke. I'll do it. Go ahead. Go on. - Fine. Be right back. - Later. ALI ISA GOOD, SHREWD SALESMAN Hey, boys! Show-off. Come and smoke a joint. See if you can still do it. He'll be flying. - See if you can still do it. Take a few drags. - Yes, with those wheels. Talk about difficult. Here, go. Do it while smoking. With one hand. On the way back, right? - Yes, do it again. Hey, Chiwawa. The wind is smoking along. - Right. I'm worn out. Where'd you get that bike? - I was just about o ask. Whose is it? Whose? - I just hit a little boy. I needed transportation. - You're still a little boy yourself. It's as if my brother and I have a contract with the police. When he gets out, I get locked up. When I get out, he gets locked up. That way, we never run into each other outside. I came back from Morocco, and I was arrested in the street. I've really had it with the cops. I was arrested on suspicion of a houseboat burglary. But on the date of the burglary I was in Morocco. Someone else had borrowed my coat. And he did it. When I came back, my neighbours snitched on me. So I was arrested. It was on a Friday. And you don't want to be picked up on a Friday. Then you're on the inside all weekend until Monday. And the time, the minutes seemed like years. Stare at the walls at your toes. There's nothing else to do. Hello. - Hello, neighbour. Have you seen Farid? I saw him a few days ago. My heart tells me that something has happened. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't drink. Maybe he's at a friend's house. - No. My heart tells me something happened to Farid. Neighbour, he will come. Just go home. If you see Farid, tell him to go home because I can't sleep a wink. God will praise you. Don't worry. He will come. Just go home. Just like one of those rivers in the south of France. With waves and so on. I'm sitting on that hill looking at my niece. She was washing and wanted to put her blanket in the water. When she was about to do that, she was dragged off into the air. And then she crashed right back down on the ground. I go crazy. I have to save my niece, right? So I run and run. I wanted to rescue her. When I'm about to touch her I'm lifted high up into the air. Turns out there's an evil spirit in that river. Listen to him. Are you stoned, or something? Get lost. It was an evil spirit. - Listen to him. Then explain to me how I went up into the fucking air for meters? How? Mounir? There are no evil spirits here. - Ali, They are everywhere. There's nothing but evil spirits here. And the one evil spirit tells the other evil spirit a story. Exactly. You're driving me nuts with your spirit story. Fuck off. Nouredine. - I'm losing money over here. Watch out. I'm warning you. Shut your mouth. Leave, or something. Just let me tell my story. - This guy's scaring me. Finish this shit. Get lost. - Act normal, friend. What do those sluts want? What's up with you, crazy nut? Bitch, why don't you come outside with your big mouth. Look how tough she looks. Yes you, nutcase. I'11 rip out your eyes. Fuck. Head scarf. Tight pants. You're not worthy of Islam. Moroccan men have a poor self-image. Dutch men are just lesbians. No pride, no sense of honour. It's like walking down the street with a chick. I'm so glad I'm gay. Seriously. - What do you mean? Are you dating a cheese head? Are our men not good enough for our Hanae? What? Should I stick to their shit? Look at those tramps. I don't think so. Get lost. Hey, pay up. - Oh, right. Shit, Bye. Tramps. Fuck off. - Acting tough, are we? Fuck off. Go home. All against one, tough guys. - Heretic. Fuck off. Ali, can I ask you something? Could you lend me some money? What? - Money, All. I need some money fast. - No, I have nothing. Come on, man. You'll get it back tomorrow. Here, look. - You never have money in your wallet. Take it out of the cash register. - I have nothing. In Allah's name. Those guys think I'm a pawnshop. - Hey, Dries. What does it say? - Fries from Ali also on Sundays. - Good job, son. What's the point of having him read the same thing every time? He knows it by heart. Dries, read that. - Bakery Insulinde. Well done! - Good job. That baker was a nice man, right? And I'm not? - You? Ali's a great guy. Give me some money. You'll get it back tomorrow. Hey, Ali. Come on, man. - That's really too bad. Hey, come here for a sec. OK, give me the money. Employment agency. Mean anything to you? Shit, is that what you called us back for? Ran a whole marathon for nothing. I'm on a long, narrow road. I'm walking day and night. I don't know how I feel I'm walking day and night day and night day and night. Listen, go to Heertje, and ask him what weed, hash and coke cost. Everything. OK? I need a gram. That's 50 bucks. The problem is that I have no cash. So what are you doing here? - What can you give me for this? You can spend that on some ass. - Please. What can you give me? Give me cash or leave. - What if I also give you this phone? What kind of phone? - Be my Black. It's still new. You're getting nothing. - Please, give me something. Come on, man. There was no need for that, man. Look who's talking, junkie. Everything OK? Hey Heertje, what are your prices? Heertje is stealing our customers. That money could have been in our pockets. Farid is a lousy bastard. He won't come to us. Farid? - Look at the way you treat him. You bully him all the time, 50 why would he come to you? Things are getting out of hand with him. He's a crack-addicted junkie, 50 ho wonder it's getting out of hand. It's all just the opposite. Weed is 45 hash 35 and coke is 50 euro per gram. What is his price for hash? - 3. Then we can get hash... Fuck him, fuck him. Now that we know his prices we can go lower. Do you have a light? - It's not working. No one has a light. - Ask if Al does. I'll go get a light. - Ali is gambling. Look at him. How much have you lost yet, Ali? - None of your business. Do you have a light here somewhere? Ali has the key to that machine. He won't lose anything. Come over here with that light. - We need it too. Hand me your cigarette. Ali is gambling again. He's losing a lot. Look, he's run out of money. Hello. Next week. Honest. Fine. Yes, I understand. OK, it will be fine. His joints have been sucked on! - Yeah, man. Listen, I have some phones here. I want to get rid of them. This one. - Take it easy, friend. All of a sudden you can talk to me. I have a Berry Black here. It's BlackBerry. He reads it the Arabic way from right to left. It says BlackBerry. - Show me the other one. Do you have more? - This one. That's my phone. - Disappearing act. This is my phone. Where did you get it? What do you mean? - Its my mobile. Your mobile? Talk to your buddy. Want to buy it or not? - Are you crazy? Why would I buy my own phone? - Junkie. I'm not giving it back. Get him. Give me that mobile. - Here. Junkie. - Hey, Chiwawa. You better stay out of my sight. Come on. Come on then. Filthy dog. One more fries. - Yes. And a Red Bull. - I'll finish sweeping first. Hello. - Hello. You can't do that. Don't worry about that kind of guys. Easy. What if he knows your brother? - As if my brother doesn't know I smoke. I show up stoned every day. What if I run into him in the mosque? Then what? You? Going to the mosque? You? - To steal shoes. You got those Dolce & Gabbanas there too. Filthy thief. There you go. - Thank you. Stop that. That language, Mr Willems. Incredible. I can understand those boys. I used to be just like them. Fighting every day. The feeling you don't fit in. I get that. Hold on, Mr Willems. It's getting out of hand. Are you nuts? - It's over. This is my neighbourhood. Are you insane? Go back to where you came from. - Take it easy, guys. Split up. Mounir, take him along. They're my friends. We grew up together. We're inseparable. They're great. They're always there for me. Your family is always there. You don't choose your family. You choose your friends, they choose you. You have an unwritten pact together. Friendship is the most important thing there is. Without it you're alone. That man's always busy. - That's what I mean, man. He goes back and forth all the time. That guy makes a lot of money. I'm full. They're hyenas. This guy gets everything. - He smokes and doesn't pay. Friend. What do you have there? - Don't touch my scar. Don't you dare touch my scar. Nouredine, come here. Faggot. - Come. What's up? - What's up with you guys? I just touched his fucking scar. - What's up with you? We didn't beat him up, did we? We just threw him out. Calm down. I want you to go outside. Now. Let's go. - Come on. Don't be paranoid. We just split them up. We can't do anything right with you. - Don't always answer back. Easy. Outside. - Do we have to eat this outside? Outside, or at home. I don't care. What's up? - I just touched his fucking scar. And he flipped out. But why did you touch it? - I don't know. I was just curious. You're going to be the death of me. - Insane Kurd. Hello. What 'hello"? Get lost faggot. What do you do here all day? Nothing? - What? Do you see us doing nothing? I've got something for you. - Don't talk about that kind of shit here. Let's go around the comer and talk. I mean a job. - A job. I have a job for you if you want it. You'll make 350 euro a day. Do you have a record? - Friend, I have no record. I don't accept anyone with a record. - Go away. Fuck off. - What 'anyone with a record"? I'll shove it up your ass. - Go away. There you go. You probably think you're the emperors of the square. Which ass did this? Where's Mo? What do you mean 'where's Mo"? - Where is he? Why do you come here acting all crazy? Where is he? Ali, this child was badly beaten up. Who did that? - Which ass is it? You know where Mo is. - Go home. Who knows who did it? - Don't be stupid. Was it you? - What 'was it you'? Who of you was it? - Mo. Calm down. Let's have a smoke. I promise I'll find out. Outrageous. We're adults, they're kids. They fight and make up the next day. They shouldn't think he has no one. He's not alone. Who did it? What "Mo'? - Are you Mo?" What? Ali, I'm going to... - What are you going to do? Fine. - What 'fine'? I'm going to report it. Guys, you can tell the police. Go, go! Go ahead and report it. I'm not afraid of you or the police. Get lost. Get lost, filthy Kurd. Where's that homo Mo? - I'm here. What's wrong with you, Mo? - Nothing, I don't know. What have you done? - It wasn't me. I was raised the hard way right from the start. That's my second nature. Its all I know. I think it's weird when Dutch children do something very bad, and the parents just talk to them. I get a slap right away, or get hit with a broom. I think it does make one aggressive. Myself. I mean, if someone makes a very small mistake I can make a big thing out of it. And get pretty aggressive too. I've ended up in brawls over the stupidest fucking things. So yes, it's second nature to me. I didn't do anything. I just touched him and that dude flipped out. You touched my wound. Why? What happened? I had a fight with a group of Moroccans that night. He was one of them. Is that true? Don't. No, stay seated. Sit down. I don't want this. Are you sure he was there? - I'm almost sure. Almost? Not a hundred percent, but... See? Shake hands. You don't want a record, do you? Are we done then? - Then we're done. Fuck off! Eyup, 'm not saying you're wrong, but how long have our families known each other? We don't deliver on credit anymore. - What am I supposed to do? No money, ho goods. - Is that the way you talk to me now? Say hi to your dad. Mom, what was that about? - Nothing, honey. Because we don't pay cash we don't get anything. And that means? No money? I did have money, but it's gone. I bought groceries. I'm going. Is something wrong? - No. Bye. Look at that. Stay there. - He's being difficult. Hey, friend. - What 'friend"? Stay there. - You're crazy. What's his name? - Diesel. Stay there. - He's collateral. Get him. Get him. Nouredine, look. - No. The great Nouredine is scared. It's collateral, right? Get back. - What am I supposed to do with it? Don't let him come near me, or ['I cut his throat. What's his name. - Diesel or something, right? Stay there, friend. Why are you scared? - I've been attacked before. Was I supposed to let him go without paying? But why take a dog? - He has nothing else. Why are you scared? - I've been bitten before. So what should I do with it? - Give lit to... Chiwawa, go and sell it. Sell it to that neighbour. He likes dogs, right? Tell him: A nice pit-bull on sale. Chiwawa knows everyone. - He'll fix it. Stay away from me. Chiwawa, take him away. Come on, Diesel. Hey Nouredine, look at that awesome dog. Look. Chiwawa s taking the pit-bull along, or that pit-bull is walking Chiwawa. Ali is scared too. See? He's scared too. Nice, or not? - Ali's scared too. Are you crazy? - He's angry. You're right, Ali. - Ali's always angry. He closed the door. It would be an awesome member of our crew. Farid. Go to bed, man. I can't sleep, man. I can't sleep at home. You look terrible, you know. I think you're smoking too much weed. Too much going on. I want to go away. Away from everyone. How about looking for a job? I was in jail for six years. Who's going to hire me? I don't work for a boss. I can't stand it. It makes me completely paranoid. Carry my groceries and come home with me. Get up. - Why don't you go home. I'm saying get up and come home. - Leave me alone. Come on, move. Can't you leave me alone for once? Take it easy. I'm coming. Can't you ever leave me alone? - Don't talk to your mother like that. Stay out of it. - I'm just trying to help. It's none of your business. He's just trying to help you. Why are you hanging around? Go and do something. So these are your friends. They're just laughing at me. Take it easy. - Look at those slackers! Come on, move it. What are you looking at, filthy whore? That's my homeboy, brother. He raps how I feel. So how do you feel? - He raps how I feel. So how do you feel? Can't you put out that cigarette? - What? Please don't smoke here. - Here? Do you see a ho-smoking sign? - Are you crazy? The food doesn't taste good this way. - Then eat inside. We're smoking outside. - Could you not smoke? The Netherlands is full. OK? For you too. - I was born here, nutcase. By accident. - Oh, some tough talk now. You're ruining the country. You take away our jobs. At it again, boys? - Well, it's true, isn't it? Chasing away my customers again. He only came to this country yesterday and he's already acting tough. Calm down. - We're sitting here, right? I'm enjoying a smoke and... the no-sunshine. Behave, all right? How is it? - Good, thank you. Ali speaks Polish? - Of course I do, man. Snackbar Ali International. - Hold this. That's my brother. What the fuck. What the fuck are you doing? Throw that away. Go home! - Take it easy. Filthy donkey. - Leave him alone, man. I'll tell your mother. Just you wait. I know where she lives. Can you give me a hand? - I'm coming. I have to get to work. - What was going on? That asshole was smoking weed. I taught myself to play it because I was very homesick when I first came to the Netherlands. I never took any lessons. It was a longing for where I came from. I wasn't able to integrate. I really wanted to. I had to, because that was me. I was both Dutch-Western and Turkish-Eastern. But I just wasn't able to. Then, after trying very hard and all sorts of experiments . just left it for what it was. I thought: It's not going to work. Be honest. Real Madrid is better. - They used to be. Real Madrid, friend... - You have Messi. Look who you have! What's his name? - Cristina Ronald in ho. He's a transvestite. Is that a forward? Don't talk that way about Cristina. - He's just gay. Barça, we screwed you five or six times. - Doesn't matter. Well get you back. With a transvestite as a forward? - Don't talk that way. What are you doing? - He's just talking... What are you doing? - Don't touch me. Get lost with your fucking Barça. Stop it, friend. - What? Acting tough now? Acting tough now? It's over. This man wants... - Over. Hamza, calm down. Calm down. It's over. It's over. What's up with you? Want to act tough? - It's over. Want to act tough? One of us has to die. I swear. Fuck off. Get out of my way! One of us is going to die! One... Bring it on. - It's over. Bring it on, show-off. - One of us is going to die. One of us is going to die! What 'die'? - Stop it. It's over! I'm not dead yet. I'm not dead yet! Help me, brother. Help me, brother. Now look what happened. Come on. Come on. Can't you see that... Come on. Run. Muslims from hell! Come back and help me! Mounir. Come on. Get up. Quickly. He started acting weird and difficult. So what do you do? It was so weird, man. But now what? Should I just... Was that window expensive? Don't worry about it. It's been replaced. Right? This sucks. No, that they just left you there, and you nearly bled to death, that really sucks. I wasn't alone. There was something there. I wasn't there alone. There wasn't anyone. Something held on to me, Ali. Something. Who was it? Allah. Who? - God. God saved me. I'm going for a smoke. Pinar! Pinar! What was that, Ali? You left and abandoned me. Tell me why. Tell me why. Why, sweetheart, why? Act normal, guys. Are you OK, Ali? How are you? - Fine. Cigarette for the stress? - Act normal. She's furious. - Yes, man. Did you see he wanted to kiss her? - No. He wanted to kiss her, but she just kept walking. He was standing like this. He sees that nothing is coming. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. OK guys, abs. Help each other. Come on. One, two three, four. One more. Five. Good. These are my two soldiers. - These? They fight and people can place a bet. You're right. - Right? I'll place a bet on this man. - He's dangerous too. Who of you doesn't have a record? - Please go away. Get lost. What are you doing here? I get a record he cause of types like you. - So you don't have one yet? Then I've got work for you. - \What kind of work? In the harbour. - In the harbour. Hanging in a crane? We hang out here. No hanging. I have good work for good pay. Are you deaf? Get lost. Don't you want to get married at some point? That story again. - Don't you want a good job a decent salary, a nice wife? Do you think a woman wants someone with no prospects like you? 'No prospects'? Who the fuck do you think you are? You behave like a fucking cheese head. These two are going to make us rich. - Show us. Look: BAM. Hands up. Not too hard. Keep each other in one piece. You still have to fight. Don't get exhausted. What about that work? - Are you serious? We'll get him later. Faith makes you who you are. It opens your mind. It makes you think. It makes you feel at home. I still get that feeling with my parents and relatives. A sense of safety. And I used to feel it with my friends. But the good thing about faith is that it never turns its back on you. Never. Check it out. There's that neighbourhood traitor. Traitor. - Arsehole. Fucking traitor. Stop this, guys. - Just you wait. Stop it. - Now that hitch isn't talking. Mounir is a good boy. He pays taxes. So do you. Does that make you a good person too? You've forgotten about us. Just you wait. You found work, right? - Yes, go and work. Hey. - Who wants to buy a bike? How much? - Who bids the highest? Let's see. - 30 euro. It has a pump and everything. It's been hijacked. Later. Who are those sumo wrestlers? Do you know them? In the name of God, I already told you. I spent it on orders. On orders? I'm asking you something. Talk to me. OK fine. I lent it to someone who really needs it. Oh Ali, you drive me insane. Don't come near me. Look at my grey hair. I'm dying. Fading? - Yes, completely fading. You're not fading at all. You still look very beautiful. Hi, my daughter. Come. How was school? Nice. - Aysun, don't you have homework to do? Why are you sending her away? - Sending away? Stay. - Just go. Get your stuff. I'll be right there. I'll see you later, OK. - OK. So you won't tell me? - Enough, Pinar. We're done. Do you see that fag? Filthy traitor. Homo. Traitor, - Stop that. Just you wait. - Stop it. Come on! Animals. Hey, give me my knife. - Your knife? Come outside. Where's that fag? Get lost. - Give me my knife. Get out of here. Coming? - Where to? Come to Maastricht with me. - No. Why not? - I have to work. They need me. - They need you. Mohammed, do you think I came here for fun? Can you count? Yes? What? You can probably count one, two, three. Friend, 'm talking about the big time. Count. What's up with you? Get lost. Count it. - Can I come? Of course you can't come. Just fuck off. It's a thousand, right Mo? They could be yours, if you want. There and back? There and back, brother. Give the keys of my moped to my brother and be careful with it. Hey, your brother asked me to give it to you. Take it easy, OK? Where's Mo? - I'm not allowed to say that. Talk, friend. I'm not allowed to say. - Why not? Why are you sucking up to Heertje? I was with Mo. - If I see you with him again you're dead. Then you can stay with him. You're completely paranoid. - Here, roll. Do you have some hash for me? - Just get lost. Who told you I'm dealing? - It says so on your forehead. What are you doing? Hey, take it easy. Have you seen Ali? - No, man. What's up?

Stupid country. - No, don't go to Morocco. I'm going to Morocco. It's better for me, for my parents. All that stress. No, I love you. So do your parents. You know that, right? Friend, look at me. - What should I do, man? You're not going to Morocco. - I just want to leave. First get some sleep. OK? - I'll sleep when I'm dead. Here, a smoke for the stress. - Go to your mother. Hey weed cutter, back already? Nice and easy? - Relaxed? You know that I went to Maastricht with Heertje, right? I have something for you.

Really? - He still has 15 kilos at home. 15 kilos? - And he only gave you a thousand? Homo. See, that's why I don't like that fag. This is exactly why. - He's a pervert. You made me happy today. I was completely paranoid. How's your brother doing? I don't know. - You don't know? You don't know that he's dying? - Are you kidding? He is in hospital. Do you swear? - Yes, I swear it. No one told me. - He had an accident with your moped. Leave some for me. - Yes, don't worry. Are we going to arrange something? He has more. With Heertje? - Yes, you heard what he said. He can know too. Coming tonight? - Of course. You only have to be on the look-out, but you get your share. Scouts honour, keep your mouth shut. See you tonight. Go inside. There's a car. Come on. Is it safe? Hurry. - Go. I'm coming. Come on, friend. - Move. Don't run. Let's see, so much money... Chiwawa, come on. - Hurry! My daughter, I'm going to your aunt Nevin. Your mother needs some rest. OK? Don't say anything to your father. I've got my mobile with me. 'I call you and you can always call me. OK? - OK Take good care of yourself. - I will. I'm going to aunt Nevin. Your sister already knows. [I call, OK? Take good care of yourself. Come here. Take care of each other. Check it out. Look who's coming outside. Hey, underpants. Go to jail. - Now. Better sew your ass shut. I'm going to kill you, snitch. Filthy snitch. Look who wants to screw you. - I'll screw your mother. Fuck off, filthy homo. Look at those plants. Look at those plants, friend. Bye bye. That guy's a real homo. Look how much it is. - Didn't you smell it last night? You went inside. I didn't. - Dude. It hurts, man. - Chiwawa, see if you can grab a plant. There's only one cop car left. Quick. Try it. - Be on the look-out, like last time. Here, give me that shit. See if there's more, OK? He's doing it. He's insane. - Look, he's inside. I hope he gets arrested. It's all gone. - Everything? It's all gone. It smells heavily of weed over there. Chiwawa. Aren't we getting anything? - What? Aren't we getting anything? I'm serious. Soldiers. He's right. Blackmailer. - Go buy some candy. Share, OK? Thanks. Those are my soldiers. Just that situation at home. It seems as if I failed in life. I didn't... My father wanted me to succeed at everything, but it seems as if he's not my father. He's never said: I love you, son. Not once. He's never said that. It's just... I don't know. Those are things you miss sometimes. Ali became a new father tome. I never used to be like this. Never. But... I don't know. I don't feel accepted by anyone. At home or outside. People look at me funny. It's tough. If people have that image of me, then screw everything. I don't give a shit anymore. Ali. I can mediate. I've done it before. Mediate? Pinar, right? She'll be back tomorrow. I mean it, you know. It's up to you. Hey, Ali. We smoke joints every day. But you have something too. I don't want to talk ah out it. Why not? We're men. We can talk about it together. You're not men yet, boys. Ali, we're men. Right? You're going to get dizzy. That always happens to me with weed and booze. Mounir? - Good evening. Good evening. Everything all right. - Just fine. He just came from the mosque. It's so weird. So suddenly. Now there's just us. - God willing. Hey, relax, man. - So you're a snitch now. What are you talking ah out? - You're a fucking snitch. What's up with you? Why are you snitching on me? Take it easy. - Take your hand away. What are you talking ah out? - You're a snitch. What? - Why were the cops at my place? Why are you asking me? - I'm asking you. Why were the cops at my place? - Why are you asking me? I'm asking you one more time... - Ali, What were you thinking? Hey! Guys! You're mistaken, right? Do you know what travellers are? I'm three times as bad as them. I'm from the ghetto. The ghetto, friend. The ghetto. My dick. - My dick up your ass, filthy whore. Next time without a weapon. 'I kill you. Yeah, you're so rich you're chilling out at the Snackbar. You're... - You're on slippers. Buy shoes. Slippers! Come on, throw. Learn to throw. Bunch of wannabe gangsters. I'm the gangster here, brother. Heertje! You're a dick. - My dick in your ass, whore's son. He talks to me. He's nuts. She has no money for you. It's fucked up. What's fucked up? Look around you. That says it all. They're going to tear down my fucking house. That's it. It's just a dead nest. - Shut up. Small rooms. It stinks. - It sf inks? It smells, friend. It smells of... - Of what? Of home. It smells of home. It's fucked up, man. I grew up here, man. I was born here. Farid? Farid. Farid, my son! Why didn't you stop him? Why didn't you stop him? Oh, that screaming. It sounded like my mother. When I was little. All screwed up. Until I heard he was dead. My father. My mother has been both a father and mother to me for seven years. I didn't cry at the time. I wasn't allowed to. They said: With every tear you shed he'll bum harder. I've kept it up for seven years. Not to cry. But now I have to, or I'll explode. Give Ali a cigarette too. Hold your head high don't let it worry you my heart, my heart don't show you're crying don't let it worry you my heart, my heart don't let it worry you my heart, my heart there's still so much to live for don't let it worry you my heart, my heart don't let it worry you my heart, my heart
