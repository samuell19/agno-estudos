I was raised by aliens-- French, German, Jamaican, puerto rican, a Norwegian, Haitians... Mom has always given US quality time. Quality time is a crock. I want quantity. I need parenting, not voodoo or folk dancing. Where'd you get that, your shrink? Talk radio. Answering machine: Nora, I forgot to thank you for the theater tickets. Of course, the play was weird and boring. But the girls were impressed to death to be in the third row center on the aisle. I told them, "my daughter the career girl is superwoman."

One of my client's companies out in Michigan has a big problem with an old toxic landfill. So? There's an orphanage on it. Do you really have to go to Atlanta? Does this guy actually have a realistic chance? What he's got is realistic money. He's such a born-again charlatan. Even other fundamentalists laugh at him. I've seen him on cable. Preaching, or his new religious game show? You're kidding. I am not. It's called "holy-word squares." Jack, you cannot make a senator out of that man. He's against everything we believe in! We need the money. Why are we so successful and are always broke? I think it has something to do with the fact that we spend it all. Which reminds me-- I've only got two bucks. You got any cash? Sure thing. I got-- oh, this is what Caroline gave me. Oh, Jack, this is awful. It is so awful. What? It's a greeting card from the kids. Today's our wedding anniversary.

Our real problem is this think tank weekend in Barbados for 32 generals. Especially with the hookers. Flownin, chip? Somebody should have thought that through, hap.

What about Matthew, chapter six, verse six? "But thou, when thou prayest, "enter into thy closet, "and when thou hast shut the door, "pray to thy father, which is in secret." I see what you're driving at. But what about Matthew 5:15? "Neither do men light a candle "and put it under a bushel, "but on a candlestick, where it giveth light onto all that are in the house." Jack, america needs prayer in the schools. Andstar wars! Besides, we don't have to agree on the issues. I didn't buy this computer for its theological and political opinions. I bought it for its technical excellence. Now, that's what you have, Jack. You are the best media consultant money can buy. Just do for me what you did for Travis in Tennessee. Is that what you think, reverend Hodges? Call me Lamar. I mean that I'm the best, and therefore I'm for sale? No offense, Jack. Besides, I only want to rentyou. Like the good book says, "render unto Caesar therefor the things which are Caesar's." Matthew again. 22:21. You do know your book. Ha ha ha ha ha! I like that! I like you. I think we have a lot in common. You know, you're 27 points behind in the early polls. I have $4 million pledged. And that's just for the TV. Now, you can play a lot of catch-up ball with that kind of money, Jack. [ Intercom buzzes ] Yes, missy? There's a call for Mr. Cromwell. It's from his wife. Did you get him? Uh-huh. What'd he say? He told me to grovel-- maybe they'll take me back. Groveling. I tried that once when Marvin told me to acquire a marketable skill. What if Jack doesn't need me without a career? Is he coming home tonight? Waiter: Chocolate orgy... A "chocolate to die," and for you, chocolate nirvana-- the anti-depressant. Well, I gotta go sell some junk bonds now. I'm sorry things didn't work out with this new guy. What the heck. I would love to have a child, though. Have you thought about a sperm bank? Goodbye, Max. Have a nice-- never mind. Max has a gun in her purse, she may really do it this time. There's a cab, gotta go. I'll call you later, Nora. Bye, Max. Max: "Sparkle" the Baton twirler. She's twenty. I got sweaters older. They met at the homecoming in Columbus. I think that's where Ohio is. It was halftime. Sparkle was twirling this thing flaming at both ends. Their eyes locked. It hit her at the same moment. The Baton? The sparks. I don't know what to do now-- I don't know what to do. Oh, boy. Hey, give me my purse! I'm just gonna look in it for a minute, that's all. Damn it, what is this? What are you doing with this? Are you crazy? Is this thing loaded? Please, Nora, it's a cigarette lighter-- of courseit's loaded. Give it to me! What is the use? Nobody wants a homemaker. That's it, my life is over. My life is over and out like padded bras. Nora's mom: Thanks again, Nora, for fixing up the museum. The girls and I went straight in.

I assume you did, I didn't see anything on the news. Nora, I've been thinking-- maybe you ought to grovel. It's an awful risk, what you're doing. Anyway, I know I shoulda called sooner, but I met this new fella. [ Click; Hangs up ] [ Beep ] Nora, it's skip. I've talked to Sonny and to chip. About this morning-- we realize we've loaded too many accounts on you. We want you back, Nora, aàcomprende? With the raise you wanted and the senior v.P. Stripe, and no lie detector test.

Really, I'm in control. New shirt? Yeah. It's very nice. No, honey, I... I think it's not actually a... Breakdownthat I'm having. It's--it's more like a total mental collapse.

I can't, Jack, honest, I can't! Okay, look. We'll work it out together, just the two of US. I promise. I cannot go back there. They are puerile and evil. Well, that's one corporate style. No, I mean it. I told you so on the telephone. Nora, just relax. Look, you know, you can always take the whitefield offer. No, no--no offers anywhere-- don't you understand that? Well, what are you gonna do, then? Be a wife and a mother. Full time. Ha ha-- ha ha ha ha ha! What are you laughing for? You're not serious. I am veryserious. You can't be. Of course I am, why not? Well, be-- because it's ridiculous! I mean, you're educated! You wanted a career! You wanted it all, remember? Well, this is it-- this is exactly what it is. Oh, yes, some days it's boring, it's idiotic, but you don't quit, you don't walk away. Men don't--men can't. They keep trying, they keep going. You gotta make it happen, you gotta make it do something. You gotta give it meaning! Hope! You sound like a motivational tape. This is exactly what you wanted. You wanted equality? This is it. Welcome to life, baby, on its own terms. Oh, no, not on its own terms. No, on men'sterms. Just because you guys have been doing it this way for thousands and thous-- I refuse! I did not fight for equality to then just carve out my own little egotistical share of history's blood and stupidity! There are so many things, Jack. Your socks should match.

Putting reverend Lamar Hodges in the senate? In the white house, maybe? Okay. Where are you going? Out! What does that mean, "out"? "Out," as in splitting, leaving--I'm departing. Running away, you mean. What, to some bar or something? Yeah, maybe. Maybe I can find a drunk who makes more sense. But I thought men didn't run away. Men can't, no! They have to face the real world and try to make it better! Nora, grow up. Freeze! Oh, come-- what are you doing? I don't have an answer to that right now. Is that thing loaded? No, it's Maxine's.

It's nine o'clock already, I'm hungry. In a minute. Just be patient. Is she all right? Is chernobyl? Caroline, I think that's enough. Okay, okay... Here. Here. What isthat? Veal cordon bleu. Looks like dead rats. I'm sure it's delicious. It's a classic French delicacy. Why don't I serve? What's this sticking up? It's a rectal thermometer! I could not find the other one. Pathetic! I'm sure it's gonna taste very well. [ Smoke alarm ] What's that?! [ Coughing ] It's the smoke alarm. Her dessert's on fire. Jack: Nora. Nora! Listen, I can't find my shirts. Somebody stole all my shirts! Did the laundry take-- [ telephone rings ] All right, all right. Keep your shirt on. Or maybe you're keeping myshirt on. Hello. Wally. How could you let Hodges make a TV spot without US?! No, I haven't. I was going to as soon as I found my shirt. Never mind. Okay, okay. [ Lamar on TV ]: The fate of a nation is born in the classroom. I want to teach our children the truth. The lord made man entire, and all of the fishes, and took his rib to make woman. Now, my opponent believes manevolved-- whatever that means. What do you believe? This? Or this? Don't let them make monkeys out of our children. Thatis the end of western civilization. You're right, Wally, it's effective. It's terrible, but it's effective. I'll see you in Atlanta this afternoon. Bye. You're going to Atlanta again? Atlanta, Chicago, Boston-- all of them, till November. You know, it's election time. I always traveled before and you never minded. I was never home before. We've been living in this house for six weeks, and you've only been home for three nights. I did tell you about this meeting at the school to get a traffic light at that intersection. All right, you got my proxy. I can't find my shirts-- somebody stole my shirts. No, they didn't. I did your shirts for you this week. The laundry charges four dollars per shirt. Did you know that? I didn't know that. That's $20 a week that we are saving. And I love ironing. It's relaxing. What's that? Scorch marks. They're only on two. I was watching Oprah Winfrey-- Nora, look, we gotta talk. Honey, it won't happen again. Sit down. Now, look... It's not the scorch marks, and it's not the burnt meat. It could happen to anyone. Burning takeout food? I was reheating it. Mom called, I forgot. It's not that. Or the children's despair. Sam is very happy. He's out of therapy. I know it's only been six weeks and we need a period of adjustment, but we're not adjusting. We got a major problem here. What's the problem? You. Being here. Being in this house. You don't belonghere. You're not goodat it. In fact, you're bad at it, and you know that, don't you? It's unnatural. But it's all right-- there's no shame in it. Listen, it's tough being a homemaker. But hey, I wanted to hit like Reggie Jackson. Nobody blames you. I know it was something that you had to try. Okay? But now--please-- go back to work. Let the professionals run things here. Home sweet home again, hmm? I'll be down in the kitchen. [ Sighs ] I'll never forgive you, either. Oh, no, no. You were shallow and self-centered. Andsomebody. I am somebody. I am a housewife. Huh! Woman's day canceled your subscription. Dad! For one minute in a very long life, let's talk. Are you happy? Sure. How's school? Okay. They don't steal your bike at knifepoint up here. The kids are kinda out of it. One kid thought the sandanistaswas a puerto rican rock band. How are you doing with mom? Okay. She's the worst maid we ever had, but I like her the best. She started taking cooking lessons so we didn't have to drink the jello out of the glass last night. You ever heard of Charles dickens? Yeah, I've heard of him. Mom and I are reading Oliver twist. The comic book version? Caroline-zilla strikes again! You're so stupid. I know about ministration and girls going crazy. It's "menstruation," stupid. Caroline, please! Uh, Caroline, you're not starting, uh, you know--? What do you care? You're too busy commuting. That's not fair. Fair? What's fair? Going to a school with a lot of humanoids who think dual exhaust pipes are a worthwhile goal in life? Having a mother who reads paperback romances and watches daytime television? She'll be calling phone-in radio shows next. I think she already has. Caroline: She ruined everything. And you let her do it. Why don't you admit it, and divorce her? You don't know anything about this ormen and women. I'd love you to tell me. Honestly-- I'd love to hear. We're a family. Now, people in a family, the family people... Marriage is very complex. It's the most complicated relationship there is. Now, what we are going through here is... I don't know what we're going through. Look, I don't like it either, but I'm trying to make it work. Now, it's only been six weeks. Almost time for a garage sale. We're having one-- a week from Sunday. I don't want a mother that's just a housewife. There's more to life than just battering people with your naive and arrogant judgments. Mom needs this-- weneed this. She's doing this for you. Yes, for US. For our happiness. You'd need an ice ax to cut the happiness in this house. And she's not doing it for anyone but herself. You've read about the "me generation"-- she's very typical. Why the suitcase? I'm going back on the train with you. I thought you were staying through the weekend. Well, there's worse things than loneliness. Even grandma can't stand it. Call me cherie,dear. "Grandma" is such a vulgar-- Nora: Sam, you forgot to make your bed again. And mom, you left your ice cream dish right there on the end table. You left dirty clothes-- again--all over the place. How many times-- it's 7:20. I gotta go. Wait--I'm making pancakes, I am. The batter is allready. Yeah, see? Can we have 'em for dinner? Okay. Everybody ready? Buckled up? You're not, sweetheart. [ Loud pop music plays ] A little lower, sweetheart. [ Lowers volume ] Mom, open the door first. You certainly didn't think I was gonna drive through the garage door, did you? [ Radio changing stations ] Sam: Mom, that's A.M. Nora: That's a very interesting show I found. Radio: And now, radio's most popular phone-in show-- "tell me where it hurts," with psychologist Dr. Tony Prescott... Woman: Oh, there's Nora! Hi, Nora! Oh, hi! Hi, Donna! Hi, Jim. So the husbands finally connect. Honey, I want you to meet our neighbors, the Sawyers. The ones you thought might have two heads. I'm Donna and that's Jim. Hi, Jack cromwell. Do you golf? No. That's a relief. Donna, I want you to meet my mother, Leona horton. My dad, Dr. Tom hartley. How are you? I felt the same way at first. You marry a high-flying career woman, learn how to say "chairperson," and end up out here as ozzie and Harriet. I went through the same thing eight years ago. Wanna hear? Didn't think so. My wife died four years ago. And then I had my heart attack. That's when I moved here to the suburbs. And I stopped smoking and started jogging. And now I go in three days a week to teach at New York--Cornell. That's wonderful! I only live three blocks from there. What's your specialty? Pediatric surgery. I'm kind of a kid myself. But my colleagues ordered me to give up living alone in the city. Now I envy you-- all that excitement still. Excitement? Ha ha ha ha! Dr. Hartley, I'll be honest with you. My life is so barren I get euphoric when vanna sells a vowel. [ Both chuckling ] Oh, here we go. I'll pick you up at 3:30! She'll get over it, mom. Tatum O'Neal did. Hey, check it out! Here comes the new girl! Hey, spanky, please. Stick to your magazines. This nugget belongs to "throwback" drummond. Girl: Hiya, throwback. Give me 22 minutes and I'll give you the world. And when you're ready-- I figure that's any day now-- cry out. I'm the cure. I got the right car, and I'm devoted to the primitive. Grrr... Radio: Hi, we're back now. This is Dr. Prescott with "tell me where it hurts." Woman: I'm Carla, from Fairfield county. Prescott: Hi, Carla from Fairfield county. I used to be "Carl." I'm a transsexual. I have my same job still, but you know what? They pay me less now as a woman than they did when I was a man. It's that old equal pay thing, right? [ Doorbell ] Thanks for calling. We'll pause for a message, I'm happy to say, from a new sponsor. [ Dixieland music plays ] Good morning. Divine home cosmetics wants you to feel good about yourself on the inside, and that begins in the outside. Feel good about myself? I feel terrible aàabout myself. I have ruined the lives of my loved ones. I'm a terrible cook, cleaner, planner-- all-around failed female person. You see, I have squandered my education, betrayed my marriage vows, and the movement! I have surrendered my dreams and goals, all for my husband and children-- who do not need me. I do not need me. Youdo not need me. Do you know that when I make a bed, the sheet is hanging below the spread? I thought that if I gave my life to my family, it would be great. I would be fulfilled, and they would blossom-- well, have a really nice day! Wait! Wait! Please! Listen, there's more! I'm not finished! Nora: I don't know, Sam, football is so dangerous. It's only touch, mom. I'm not so wild about it, either. But I have to play or they'll think I'm a wimp. Is a sleep-over okay? Sure, but is Billy's mom picking you up? Yeah. He's an okay kid. Really--i need a friend. Where's Caroline? Oh, I forgot--she has a sleep-over, too. Here's the number. Thisby Tannenbaum's. I gotta go. Wait, give me a kiss. Mom, they're all watching. Okay, give me a high-five, huh? Awright! Machine: Hi, I'm Jill. Have you ever thought about selling real estate in your spare time? Lots of housewives do. In fact, many of them even-- [ beep ] Hi, I'm Jane, and I'd like to talk to you about selling life insurance in your spare time-- [ beep ] Hi, I'm Jackie. Have you ever thought of selling cosmetics-- [ beep; Hangup ] [ Beep; Hangup ] [ Beep ] Hi, it's Jack. I'm in Atlanta. Guess who was on the plane? Skip and Maxine. She's his assistant now, looks pretty good. She even smiled once. Oh, skip said to tell you, anytime you're ready, he'd hire you back. I told himi was ready, even if you weren't. Listen, Nora, honestly, I think you should think about it. I gotta go now. I'll call you later. [ Hangs up ] [ Pop music plays ] So my parents, like, win this trip to Hawaii, and we get the house alone for a week! My folks think I'm staying with you! [ Telephone rings ] That's my mom! I bet it is! I knowit's her! Like, relax, Caroline. My mom is never gonna let me stay. It's okay. Just listen-- I'm a pro at this. Cut the radio! [ Ringing ] [ Lowers voice ] Hello? Tannenbaum residence. Why, yes, Mrs. Cromwell, hi. I'm val Tannenbaum, thisby's mother. Ha ha! Shh! Why yes, she's here. And what a wonderful girl she is. Don't you worry. My frank and i-- he's my husband-- will be here all night. [ All laughing ] Born in the u.S. Of a! Grrrr! Jack: Don't tell me-- we've gone to war with Central America. Mom's our new pioneer mother. Pioneer person. Dr. Hartley promoted me this afternoon-- I didn't have a chance to change. What happened to the other pioneer person? Mrs. Pagano? She made off with the roto-rooter man. Did you eat? I get too excited before a big game. Nora: You love bowling-- admit it. Where's the grinch? Caroline's at the Tannenbaum's. Again?boy. How's the reverend Hodges? On his own this morning. He announced that he wants to nuke Beirut. Oh, good. That should end the campaign, and you can just-- I wish I could. He shot straight up in the phone polls-- he's only five points behind now. Come on. You go ahead--i want to talk to your mom a minute. Is that better? Perfect. You weren't even watching. Sam: Hi. Oh, hello, Sam! It's only till after the election-- three or four weeks. I'm hardly here anyway. Why don't you come in to New York, we'll stay at Wally's apartment. He's gonna be tied up full-time in Atlanta. It'll be like a second honeymoon. It's a separation, and you damn well know it. Men always win, no matter what you do-- if you work, if you don't work... Is this my punishment for trying to-- I think we've all been punished a little. Oh? Was your precious, pretty little life disrupted? Let's not make a scene. I don't want to, huh? You don't? Well, I do! I want a knockdown, drag-out, screaming-- just forget it. Okay, go. Get out! Go! Go. Tonight. Leave. Go! Leona: I got the reservations for Saturday night-- lutece. I can't, Leona. I forgot-- after we talked, I realized I'm supposed to take my wilderness rangers troop overnight Saturday. But it was all set! We'd planned! You can't go camping on your birthday! You've got to find someone to take your place. Who? Nora: Hi. Of course. Nora! Greetings, pioneer mother. [ Nora panting ] Are you okay? Ohhh! Never felt better in my life. What's a little 5-mile hike... Uphill. Shouldn't we be there by now? I hope we're not lost. We're not lost-- the riveris lost. Men! Onward. Sam, honey, gimme a hand. Thank you. Okay-- aaaah! What are you all staring at? I found the river, didn't I? "The pain and swelling begin almost immediately "after the spraining incident. "Raise the foot to reduce the blood flow and to moderate the swelling and the throbbing." We did that, right. "To support the injured ankle, "take the bandage "and wrap around the foot twice. "Then wrap bandage down, under and around ankle, criss-cross in front of ankle"-- are you following this? I think I got it. All right. "Cross under foot "and then criss-cross again. "Continue this pattern "until the bandage is at an end, then tuck in to secure bandage." Hey! Well done, rangers. What's our motto? All: Do or die! Okay, now, everybody, you ready to set up camp? Yeah! Yeah! Okay, let's go to it. Oh, no. Oh, guys-- listen, fellas-- gentlemen, I got an idea. Listen, if you swear you can keep a secret... Come on, gang. Come on. We'd like three doubles and a single. Woman: Of course Sam was popular right from the start, which isn't always easy when you're the new boy in school. But now-- oh, it's amazing. After a very shaky start, he is the best reader in the class. Not only that, but he's also writing. He turned in the most delightful story this week about an overnight camping sleepout. Ha ha! It's hilarious. I'm sorry to have to tell you all this about Caroline. I don't know what it is. I know she's bright. You sure there's nothing in her personal life? Oh, I'm sorry. I guess we're early. No, that's all right. Do come in. We're finished. We really are, yes? Yes. Have you met? No. Your daughters are friends. Uh, Nora cromwell, this is frank and val Tannenbaum, thisby's parents. So, how was Hawaii? We just got back, and it was great. Pout all you want. The tannenbaums were in Hawaii, and you lied. You are grounded, Caroline... For a month. You can't! It's Halloween Friday. Thisby's, like, having a party, the biggest party of my life. I've got news. It's like been canceled. Thisby's grounded, too. Eggs, whole wheat bread... Why'd you have to, like, go to that dumb parents meeting anyway. It was better when you, like, forgot about them. First of all, there is no rule in the English language that requires the prepositional use of the word "like" before every verb. In the second place, if I understand you correctly, your principal judgment on this is not that you and thisby were lying through your teeth, but that you got caught because I'm met the tannenbaums last night at school! Not to mention the fact, Caroline, that I had to hear from your homeroom teacher that your classwork is a disaster! From, you, an "a" student. Caroline! What is wrong? Ask daddy. Meaning? You just don't get it. Why should I study? All I can ever be is a housewife, a nobody servant... A waitress, whose husband eventually leaves her. Look at you-- you're a total female failure. Why should I be any different? One article I read said she could be like this for the next five years. Caroline! Don't forget the pumpkin, mom. [ Woman on radio ]: This is Debbie speaking. I came home yesterday, and there was my husband and a girl, who--who... You know! Talk show host: Au pair. I'll say! A perfect 38! Of all the stupid programs! [ Sighs ] Dumb thing! Wonderful. Why do I listen to junk like that? How stupid! Stupid! Foolish. Aah! Do you want to talk about it? So... I owned the fast-track. I came straight out of my master's at wharton and went straight up. Banking became my life, my only life. I totally ignored my husband and kids. Till one day-- it was mother's day at school, and my son explained my absence by telling everyone I was dead. Which I realized I was, in a way, so I quit. Came home to stay. We moved out here, and it was... Rotten at first, just like you now. But finally, it was right and beautiful. But you know when I knew I was really right for myself? When I went back to visit my fast-track friends in the city, including my husband. Oh, yeah, Jim left me, too, at first. Oh, Nora, call Jack. I'm glad I was in town today. Happy Halloween. Is that a new shirt? Yeah, I picked it up in Chicago. Are you gonna see blanche and Maxine today? Both--one for brunch, one for lunch, and then back home to make a Jack-o'-lantern with Sam. Kids okay? I'm deeply moved by your concern. Nora, that's not fair. I call almost every day. You know, it's been a long time since I've had a powerbreakfast. It's funny. I don't miss them at all. You look beautiful. You're not so bad yourself. So... You comin' home or what? Right after the elections. I'm achin' for you, kid. Jack... Rent a room. Take me upstairs right now. I'd love to, but I gotta be in Atlanta. My plane leaves in an hour. You know, I saw on TV that, uh, your reverend Hodges is only two points behind. He's gonna win. Five days left, and a half a million dollar TV blitz. I gotta go. You always do. Tell me, is Hodges gonna sleep with you? Be there when you're sick? When Caroline brings boys home? Jack, who's going to teach Sam how to be a man? Politicians?! Wally?! Nora, I have to work. I just hate what you do! I do, too, but I don't know how to stop. Sell Wally the business, be a reporter again. Come home. Jack... Your little son is in wonderful shape, and I know I have made that difference in his life. I can do the same thing with Caroline, eventually. But they need their father, too. And I need a husband. Grown up...Growing old. And not so darn exciting all the time. And certainly not so self-engrossed. It sounds so reasonable... And terrifying. Honey, don't be afraid of being ordinary. It is the most natural thing in the world. You know, Jack, being in town today-- well, it occurred to me that I had made a tremendous mistake. But I knowthat I haven't. That job of mine, ah! I don't want to go back. I guess the question is... Can I go forward? Barney, it's a bull curve and tough luggage. Buy 50,000 shares. Nora, I'm sorry. I cannot get out of here. I haven't had lunch out since that time with you and Max. That was over five months ago. Yeah, well, greed keeps you busy. Blanche, you seem so different. No, that's just 'cause you are. Is there a new guy in your life? Sure. Adam Smith. Not money... No. I mean, marriage. Oh, I'm in one. Didn't I tell you? Blanche, you didn't? Relax. I'm going with a married man. You said you wanted a child. I bought a cactus. I can't decide. What do you think? I like the nose you have, Max. It's beautiful. [ Intercom buzzes ] Yes? Right. While you're thinking it over, I'll just check the patients in the other rooms. Take your time. It's a difficult nose. I mean decision. See? See. See what? I see that this guy wants to make a sale. Listen to me. Your nose is adorable. It's precious. It's perfect for your face. What's wrong with my face? Nothing! This whole thing is so silly. It's not silly, Nora. I have a couple of my own accounts at p.A.P. But I'm mostly just servicing the talk shows and gossip columns. If I had the right face, I could move into corporate. You know, we were supposed to have a nice, quiet lunch. I don't have time for any of that anymore, doll. I gotta do this on my lunch hour. I just can't believe you have your own accounts! [ Chuckling ] How's Marvin? Who? Oh...Oh, yeah. He gave up his practice, moved to L.A. He's no longer an orthodontist? Oh, no. He's sparkle's personal manager now. He got her on a game show, pointing. Did I tell ya virgin's gonna be on 60 minutes? Is she still gonna remake Casablanca? Oh, no. They shelled that idea. Oh! That's a relief. Mm-hmm. Gonna do gone with the windnow. [ Door opens ] Well... What's the verdict? I'm gonna go with the Lee remick. Mom? Happy Halloween. Hey, that's great. Where'd you get it? New York. For tonight. That's fantastic! Where's Caroline? She's not coming. She got a ride home with someone else. Oh, really? With who? She said she'll be home for dinner. Who is she with, Sam? This guy. What guy? She'll kill me, mom. This guy's a real slime. He's Halloween every day of the week. Can we go? I have to do the Jack-o'-lanterns. South Dakota? Pierre. Maine? Augusta? Oregon? Salem. India? Indianapolis. India-- not Indiana. New Delhi? All right! Oh, the pumpkin's lookin' good, honey. You think so? Yes, honey. It's the best one I ever saw. Gee... It's 6:30. She'll be here, mom. Don't make any more calls. [ Tires squealing ] [ Music blaring ] That's her. That's the slime-mobile. [ Music blaring ] [ Honking ] Hello. And don't lie. Okay. I won't. Want the truth? Oh, yes, indeed, I would. This is it. And another one-- I don't need a mother now. I'm 13 years old, and you're 13 years too late! Caroline! Well, what do you think? Well, it's not burgers, but veal cordon bleu's not so bad. Mmm, good. You ready for some dessert? No, I gotta go. I promised Dr. Hartley I'd take him trick-or-treating. Do you want to come? Thanks for asking, honey. You go on. Sam, your dad said to tell you he's really sorry he couldn't be here tonight. Yeah. Can I have a kiss? You know what? You're lots better than Mrs. Petty. Thank you. Have fun. Caroline, can I come in? Honey, listen, we have got to talk. I brought you some dinner. Caroline, I'm coming in. Caroline? Now, don't worry about the phone. I'll cover. But should you be going? Donna, I have got to look for her. I'll call in. Okay. I'll be here. Thanks. Okay. Thisby, are you sure? I haven't seen her, Mrs. Cromwell. Donna: Hello? Donna, it's me. It's okay, they found her, the police. Oh, thank god. Where? On the throughway. She was hitchhiking. She's at the children's shelter now. By the way, Jack phoned. He's back in New York. In New York? He's supposed to be in Atlanta. He said he was on his way home. Here's the address for the shelter. Um, excuse me. Um, my name is Nora cromwell. I believe you may have my daughter, Caroline-- hello. Yes, she's here. I'm grace Harper. I run the shelter. Hello. Everything's okay. I think she's scared and maybe a bit chastened. I hope you'll understand, though, that I have to ask you some questions about your home life before I can release her. Questions? These days home is not always "home sweet home" for kids. I think that can wait until you've had a chance to talk to her first. I have a small private room, if you like. Thank you. Yes. Caroline tells me that you're in public relations. Ah...was. She says you were terrific. She seems very proud of you. I wasn't bad. We could sure use some help in that direction. This way. [ Knocking ] Come in. Hi. Caroline? I don't enjoy your punishing me, but I can handle it. The real danger is that you are starting to hurt yourself. And that breaks my heart. Now, listen-- I'm pretty sure this thing is between you and me, but you must tell me what. Talk to me, or we can't ever get together. Now, tell me, please. Give me hell if you have to. You betrayed me. How? Dropping out. I believed in you. You were everything I wanted to be. Now you're just another-- just another mom. Just a housewife, and lousy at it. I thought I was getting better. You were special. Look at you now. You ran away... Back to the bad old days. Who cares anymore? It's such a drag being a girl... A woman. Caroline... I don't think I ran away. I think I ran to and forward, not backwards. Listen, we didn't fight like crazy in the 60s and 70s just to be a corporate vice president. We wanted freedom, freedom to choose for ourselves. No one is forcing me to stay home now. I chose to, and I'm incredibly lucky to even have that choice. Most women can't afford to stop working. The main reason I did it was for you and Sam. To be with you, to know you. What about your career? Oh, honey, I'll work again. I definitely will. When you're older, and that'll come fast enough. And, Caroline, another reason was the work I was doing was really... Yuck,as Sam would say. Meaningless. Next time I want the work I do to count for something. Like what they do here. I'd like to be a doctor, like Dr. Hartley. Oh, Caroline... You would make a wonderful doctor. Think I can? Yes! The best! [ Door closes ] Hi. Are you home to stay, or for laundry? Ouch. Not undeserved, though. Well, which is it? Both. I've developed a fondness for scorch marks. How 'bout you, Caroline? Are you gonna stick it through? Watch me. I intend to, because I intend to be here. Meaning? Meaning all your runaways have returned. I don't know why you left. I'm really angry with you. What about yourself? I'm a teenager. You're supposed to be a grown-up. Yeah, well, I think I signed on for a little of that today. Then you're not gonna divorce? Do you want US to? No. Neither do I. Daddy. I love you, both of you! Don't ever leave, either of you. You want mom at home? I've developed a fondness for veal cordon bleu. There's still some left. I can heat it up right now. I had pizza! I ate on the plane. We still have some work to do, I see. Caroline, you're a little tired, aren't you? I am. May I go up now? Sweet dreams, sweetheart. Good night. Good night, baby. I'll be up in a minute. She all right? Fine... In fact, fantastic. I feel pretty good myself-- aboutmyself. Aren't you supposed to be in Atlanta? I want you to come upstairs with me and watch the eleven o'clock news. Why? I'm on it. Here's a "man bites dog" story. It took place this morning in Atlanta at the tight senatorial race of the reverend Lamar Hodges. Reverend Hodges was addressing a breakfast meeting at the state commerce and industry group when he was interrupted by his New York media advisor, Jack cromwell. I would-- excuse me, sir. What is it, Jack? Ladies and gentlemen, I have to speak to you before I throw up. This man, the reverend Lamar Hodges, whom I've advised for these past few months, and whom I've gotten to know, is an unmitigated disaster, and I apologize to you... Cut! Guards! Guards! What can I say? He's trying to buy you and the people of this great state! And if you let him-- if you let him fool you, he'll drag this state back into the middle of the 19th century. He's an intellectual dinosaur! And he's a danger to US all! I beg you! I beseech you! I urge you, vote for his opponent! I caught the next plane home. What do you think? I think you look great on television! Huh! I mean, you know, about what I did. Are you kidding? I think it's great for your soul, and for the soul of this family, not to grovel. I lovewhat you did. I lovethat you're here. I loveyou. Nora: Oh, yes, that's fine. Thank you. Tuesday will be great. See you at 11:00. Nora, go home. This is a part-time job, remember? Oh, I've just been here since noon. I'm not supposed to show my face a minute before 7:00. It's our 16th anniversary, and Jack has planned some little surprise. That's nice. I read his testimony in front of congress on Monday. Can we really save a billion dollars on that one weapon? More, actually. I'm so proud of Jack. He took a big chance going with the concerned citizens foundation. I'm proud of you. You're amazing. In seven months you've doubled our donations. Can you believe one year ago we forgot our anniversary? Mm-hmm. I believe. Have a great one tonight. Thanks, grace. Nora: Jack? Where are ya? Jack? Happy anniversary! [ Cheers and clapping ] You!
