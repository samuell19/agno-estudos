(electronic music) - It's really important to know that, I didn't leave him, he left me. I came back and everything that was important to him was gone and he had just left, but he left years before. He left a very evil twin in his place. I can't even go on, I'll love him forever but that evil twin is not him. He's dead, he's gone. It would be easier if he was buried. He always keeps me waiting. - So are we gonna fight about domestic stuff? You always stay comfortable as I am. - I know you are, I just wanna see what you've got, you always have different things on underneath. (laughing) Oh shit. What have you got in there? You're probably gonna have to fucking run out anyways out here. - At a certain point, yeah. - Yeah. (giggling) Oh. (giggling) (metallic jingling) (giggling) So. - I saw Ben moving some of these from Jersey. - Yeah? - Yeah. - He was saying he was free. - Free 'cause he's in Jersey? - Yeah, yeah. Pennyltucky. - Pennsyltucky, it's pretty big, that's where I'm from. - Pennsyltucky? - Pennsylvania. - Really? - Vicky, I'm really scared. - About the human race? - No, I'm scared about-- - The planet? (laughing) - Well you have to take care of the dumb twat wife in Copenhagen. - I don't have to do anything. - You can go there-- - Shh. - And I can- - Shh. - I can meet you. (chuckles) - Like kind of a secret rendezvous? - Yeah, you can't come to Berlin when I'm shooting though, because I gotta concentrate. - Mm hmm. - I gotta concentrate. - What are you gonna focus on? (Philly moaning) Hmm Mine was growing crooked then we straightened it out. - You straighten your nose? - Yeah. - With what? - By breaking it. Sometimes you gotta break 'em to straighten 'em. - Yeah, I know. I like your beard. - Like this country. - Yeah. Ooh. You don't think I ever listen to you, do you? - I didn't say that. - I hate flying. - You need to lay down. - Well I'm just feeling squirmy. (chuckles) - You getting a little antsy? - No. Your feet stink. Are you gonna come to Europe with me? You can meet me after I've finished the movie maybe we can go to Amsterdam and get stoned for a week. - This is too much planning, it sounds ridiculous 'til we actually get to plan everything. - If I knew that you were there when I was finished shooting, it would be a lot better. - You like the idea of company which is great - Accompany when I'm finished, I like to have something to look forward to. - Yeah, a reward. - Yeah. So will you come to, will you meet me? (chuckles) - You paying? No, then then I have then basically become-- - Maybe. - It becomes responsibility, I have to be somewhere. - You wanna fucking find out, yeah you wanna hear all the good stuff, don't you? All the stories about stuff. - I don't wanna hear about the past. - Yeah. - (indistinct) sometimes it's funny, that's really (indistinct). - Sometimes it's just scary. - The past? - Yeah. Every time I left, he got worse and worse and worse. It was like, he'd start fights, he'd throw things, he threatened me, he threatened that he wouldn't be there when I got back. (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) I often wondered where I came from because, I could never imagine my parents having sex at all. They never touched, they never did anything except, my father farmed, my mother cooked and cleaned, and that was it. I always played with my dolls and and dreamt about a more exotic glamorous life, didn't quite turn out that way. It wasn't very exciting being a spinster working for a grain company. And when I had a chance to marry I did, although it was somewhat later in life. The husband was a husband, I don't think I really knew who he was. I knew he traveled and I knew he made money, and I know that he worked for a company, but he was out of town a lot. He never took me with him. And, I was somewhat excited when he asked me to meet him it seemed like some type of glamorous Hollywood movie. He'd ask me to do stupid things before and I never really questioned it. But when he said withdraw a hundred thousand dollars from our bank account, and put it in a bag and go to Berlin, I thought that it was just a little bit odd even for him. He told me to go into his desk and there was the bank account number, and I had no idea, no idea at all, that we had that money. He kept a lot of things from me, he punched me a couple of times. I'm beginning to wonder what he was, I don't know, I thought of confronting him, but when I looked in the window and I saw am sitting there with that neck of his, with his face turned away from me, that seemed to be his favorite position, with his head turned away, not paying any attention. He would just be there, in the darkness, his hand doing what men's hands do, just the shadow, and, his head and the rocking bed, sometimes I turn my back and cry. I just thought, "No, I don't want to do anything," it was a split second decision, and it's a split second decision that in no way am I sorry I made. (upbeat music) It's really weird being alone now after being with someone for 15 years. I'm so accustomed to doing things for someone else that it's just like, I mean, I don't know how to take care of myself, I know how to take care of somebody else. There's a void and I don't know how to fill it. And nothing's enough for me, I just, I want it all. And I'm afraid if do I scare them away? And I'm alone in the darkness that I'll even consume myself. They'll smother myself until there's nothing left, eat myself, actually consume as if I was like biting pieces of flesh or even my own body. And in the end, there'll only be a black void and I won't even be there at the end. (soft music) (water pouring) (soft music) (moaning) I'm strong, I'm really, I've learned, my heart's been ripped out and you don't grow another heart. Excuse me, do you speak English? Do you know how much it is, I don't know anything about the subway. Yeah everything I guess here. Oh 52 so can I-- - Oh yes, yes, yes. - Okay thank you. (background voices) - (indistinct) Let me have 50. - You don't have change do you for 100? - What's your move? - Oh, 20 say something I don't have. - You may (indistinct). - I don't have 50. - 40? - Oh excuse me, do you have change for 100? - [Man] Only singles I'm sorry. - Oh. Excuse me, does anyone have I guess change? - [Woman] I have. - Why did you have to be just now? I feel so lost, I don't know what I'm going to do next. It's all so confusing. He was there for me as long as nothing was happening, but now, I'm in this world and I don't know what's happening next. Why did he, he kept me from killing myself when I first met him, why isn't he here now when I really need him? He sent for rehab, and the right therapist, he was there, he love me. Why isn't he, he started hating me, when I started doing my own dreams. That's not fair, that's not the way it's supposed to be. When you fall in love with someone they're supposed to stay with you and love you. They're supposed to get excited when you start doing your own dreams. This isn't what I wanted he should have just let me kill myself, I was on the road to doing that, I was doing really good, with the drugs and the alcohol, and the craziness in my life. I would've have been dead, he should've just let me go. If he didn't love me for the possibility of what I could become, I wasn't some fucking science project you just do to make yourself feel good, I'm not something that you just fucking collect and put on a shelf and say, "Look at all I did for her, she was nothing when I met her. She's gonna be--" And he delighted in driving me out, in front of his friends, and talking about how he saved my life, like I was some type of rare object that had been plucked out of extinction. That's not right. That happened with time, at first, I was this treasure that was going to be lost, that he could save. I never expected to have this, I was ready to close the coffin and be dead forever and continue walking. And when I started acting again, it just sort of, it was a gift that I never expected, I savored, I still do, but he just, he couldn't deal with it, he just couldn't deal with it all, just, anything that I did wasn't good enough, it was shit, he didn't appreciate, it was like, "You didn't do what I was doing, and you didn't do it when it counted," - [Man] All good. - If, nothing matters these days, everything shift. And, I just, it's horrible to be with somebody and watch them die right in front of you. To you just watch them wither away so that you're left with the person that you love, the person that you're living with. When he packed up and left, he had left years ago, I wish he had left years ago, it would've made my heart happier, but to be with someone, I still love him, I look at a picture of him with long hair and wild eyes, and, that mischievous crazy smile on his face and I break down crying. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (automated voice speaks foreign language) (upbeat music) (bell rings) (automated voice speaks foreign language) (train doors opening) (train doors closing) I'll love him forever if he would come back to the door and be the person I met 15 years ago, I would, welcome them with open arms, I mean, I love that man, I'll love him forever, but it doesn't mean that I'm not gonna go on with my life. I'm entitled to have just a little bit of pleasure before I die, and I intend to get it. (door opening) It's easy to forget who you are, (door bangs) to become someone else and have absolutely no responsibility to anyone or anything. (champagne pops) (laughing) I wish I could just make myself disappear, I can push other people away, but when I try to push myself away, I'm still there, I'm stuck inside my body, and that's a real, real problem. No one's here and I'm always in the corner, and there's always me to feed, and, I'm always behind my own eyes looking out at everybody else,` and they don't seem very friendly. They'll never find me here. (footsteps) (car engine roaring) (machine whirring) Hi are you closed? - No. - Yeah I'd love to try on that shoe over there. (machine whirring) (sighs) (door bangs) Really? You think your wife fucked it up for you does she have a warrant against you or something? Oh my God. Oh fuck. I just don't-- This is too weird for me, I just thought they were flunking out. Oh shit. I think it would go back to you if you got her killed darling. Yeah. Yeah. Can you get out of the country? That's probably your best bet. This is amazing, why didn't you call me earlier? Oh, fuck. Yeah you got the right number here double check it with... - (indistinct). - Oh yeah, yeah I don't know my number here and here here talk to him for a second. This is too fucking-- - Philly he wants to talk to you. - Yeah. - He doesn't wanna talk to me. - Hello, Oh boy, no, I'm just sort of, you caught me in a very un-coherent moment, I've been drinking champagne and we're shooting a movie, and I'm supposed to be talking as my character. You've only had one beer and one joint since you've been here? Well, it's probably better at this point that you stay focused with what's happening. All I've been doing is like shooting my movie and when I've called up, they've just said, "Oh, we don't know where he is," and treating me like shit, so, I mean, I just thought that you were, if you got an email from me, it was like, "Go fuck off," because I didn't know what was happening. Oh shit, he's not selling some weed by the kilos, I don't believe you are not reality. I have no idea what to tell you to do. If you do that, then you will end up in jail for those two. But you don't look like everybody else there baby, you don't. I think your best thing is to get back to New York. I have no idea what to say to you this is all also crazy. (electronic music) I gave up, I gave up smoking, I gave up drugs, I gave up eating, I gave up everything 'cause I wanted to be healthy, and beautiful, and skinny and alive and all that stuff. I just wanna have a good time I don't give a damn any of it. I want drugs, I want sex, I wanna eat anything I want to, and I wanna consume the world and that's who I am now, I just wanna enjoy everything, and let everyone just be aware 'cause I'm out to rip the world apart. (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) (car engine roaring) I can never get away fast enough, I wonder what happened to him. Was he just trying to get money from me? I just don't care anymore. Maybe he didn't change, maybe I did, maybe I maybe that's what happened. I changed and he left me because I wasn't the same person, the person he loves is dead, and I'm left in that place. So maybe he just left me 'cause I didn't keep my promise to him, who knows? I'm just going to have to learn to be like everyone else, just keep on walking, sleepwalking, walking through the fire, if people remember me, they remember me, if they don't, it's all the same in the end. (background noises) How do you go about finding love somewhere? I loved someone then they're gone. (siren wailing) I always believed that it was just one person for me but maybe there's one essence, and it travels from one person to the other, maybe what I'm looking for is something that's now inhabiting someone else. So I have to find that somewhere, I don't know where to start, I knew what it felt like it, I remember what it felt like, and I have to have it again, I mean what use is life, is life worth living if you can't find someone who you love? And people say that there's only one person and one love, I think there's only one essence but maybe it migrates to someplace else. And you spend your whole life chasing that fleeting thing that jumps from one person to another. (background voices) (automated voice speaks foreign language) I just want to erase everything. I want glimpses of everything. I wanna have sex with strangers, I wanna have sex all men without saying anything, I want to without talking experience everything I can experience in all at once, You don't want them know your names. I want life to be everything that it was before. And have a good time, I mean what else is there in life? There's making movies, and then there's the rest of the life that you just like fill in the blanks with like sex and drugs and traveling and whatever, whatever turns you on, whatever turns on me on. I mean, I don't know what to do with my rest of my life I mean, in between the projects I'm nothing.

I just wanna go there and I wanna stay there forever. It's the same thing like what do you do when it's over? When they pack up those stupid machines that they use, and go away and you're stuck at the end, the movie's over the, the character is evaporated and you're left with that void, I mean, what do you do, how do you live? I always find myself when a project is over, not knowing who I am, mourning the creature that was, and like not really wanting to go on it's like, I've done everything I could possibly do, it's all over, and there's nothing more to do. It hits me every time, and it hits me in between the shots. It's very, very easy to push everybody away. So easy to do that, you just put your hand up and say, "Go away, go away, I don't wanna see you anymore." People understand that and they just go away. I know how to be nothing, I was nothing all my life. When I'm waiting that void comes back. I hate waiting, why can't they just keep the cameras on all the time and never stop? That's what I really want. I want that all to enstate all the time. I don't wanna be aborted out of that reality, and it happens, in between every shot, and in between every project, I mean, I know, I know how to live when the camera's turned on, but I've never quite perfected the art of living in between. Do you want me to go? I wanna be nothing, 'cause nothing doesn't feel. (footsteps) I dreamed about all those men I've had sex with, and hope that they remember me somehow.

I have nothing at all to worry about, and, everything's okay, nothing's going to go wrong. Nothing can ever go wrong in my life, because I have money, and I'm beautiful, and I have a safe place to live, I don't have to worry. I don't have to worry about anything, but I'm taking care of. I'm a very special person and I'm taking care of, I don't have to worry about being on the street, or not having anything to eat, I don't have to worry about anything, because, because... My life doesn't mean anything, I don't have to worry about anything because my life does not mean anything at all, it never did, and it doesn't now, except now I'm being a lot more honest about it. I'm not telling you this because I want to, I'm telling you this because I have to tell you. I am okay, I am taking care of, but my life means nothing. My life means nothing at all, and I'm okay. And I don't need anyone, and I don't need anything, and I have myself and I am nothing. I am nothing, I am nothing, I want to disappear I tell you, I don't wanna be here, I don't wanna be looking at you, I don't wanna be feeling anything. I want to disappear. None of this means anything to me. I don't understand what's happened, I don't understand what will happen, I have nothing. There's only the street underneath, and the cold and, nothing. (laughing) - I wanna feel nothing, but as soon as you feel nothing, you feel everything. You feel more than you ever did in your life, and it does not feel good. You know what I'm talking about? Do you know how it is to be nothing, and to feel everything, and to know, that's all that there's ever going to be is that nothing? I am nothing. (sobbing) I am nothing. Oh. I am nothing. I've been forgotten without even having live my life. I'm nothing, I never was anything, and I continue to be nothing, and now I know it. My whole life has been a lie up until this moment. And it's just know that I see that. Nobody cares about me, no one cares. (clapping) Take a bow darling, thank you. (clapping) (soft music) And now, I dream about nothing. I am nothing, I dream about nothing. I have no dreams. (soft music) (ethereal music) Underneath it all I'm really afraid of everything. Because, you never know what's going to happen next. You can have something and then it's gone. One second you're up there and everything's going on, the next second, you're in the gutter and you have nothing. People can take things away from you like that, people can definitely take anything they want to away from you, see if they'll hide what you have. You can't show it, you have to put it somewhere, very safe, safe, and sound and away from public scrutiny. I wish I could just go back to the security of my marriage, and not have to deal with all these kind of thing. (soft music) I wish I could just go back to the security of my marriage, and not have to deal with anything anymore. I wish I could go back to the security of my marriage, and not have to deal with, life. (soft music) (engine roaring) (car engine roaring) (laughing) (car door slamming) Brrum, brrum, brrruuuum. What time is it? (phone ringing) (bus engine roaring) (footsteps) I do, I have a whole big bag full of money. I have a hundred thousand dollars, and I can spend it anyway I want to, anytime I want to. I didn't lose it, I know where it is, and I can get it if I want to. I'm just hiding it so other people won't be able to find it. It's very safe where it is I'm telling you, really, really safe, no one's going to go find it, I'm okay. Everything's okay. - [Man] What's the problem? (engine roaring) (soft music) - French fries with ketchup please.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. No autographs please. Collins where's the car? I'm not going to even think about whether I get out the other side or if I just burst into flames, I mean, that's going to happen anyway. I'm taking it, moment to moment, I'm going to savor it all, and stop thinking if it is good or bad, or, like no big punch lines for me. (ethereal music)
