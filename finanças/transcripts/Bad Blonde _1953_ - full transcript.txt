You know too much to be one of them. Not that I was trying to get out of giving you that! Thanks. - I can use this.- Just a minute, son. You got a style there. Reminds me of somebody I knew once. - Can you help me out?- I can, Sharkey. Charlie Sullivan! Well, what do you know?How are you? Ah-ha! - Fine.- Good for you. That explains a lot of things. I thought that boy couldn’t be just an accident! That's right. I taught him all I know and some of the things I learned from you He's got the makings of a champion there, Sharkey. That's why I wanted you to see him. At five pounds a look? Ha-ha! This calls for a drink. If I can borrow that! Come on, Evening paper. And there was I cornered, up in the dark by these three drunken sailors. And I thought it was curtains for Charley, when suddenly in sails Johnny. Bang bang-bang. Ah, it was beautiful, Sharkey, beautiful! Yeah, I knew he was a fighter the moment I set eyes on him. What are you doing now? Well, they paid us off on the last trip. And we're sticking together until another ship's in. Fill ‘em again? What do you say? Well ... Nah ... nah, it's not for me anymore. What are you talking about? All your life you've been hoping for a fighter like Johnny! It might of been me. I couldn't make it. But that boy hasn't got a week point. No? Ah, he's young. He's a good lad that. Yeah, seems like a nice youngster. That's the trouble, they're all nice youngsters to start with. - Johnny's different.- Yeah, perhaps he's got a different way of running out on you. My boy don't run out. Look, he knows I think you're best trainer in the business. But I've got a booth now. That boy's too good to be bashed about three times a day. Besides, I I lost all my contacts. What about that promoter pal of yours? Italian chap. You mean Giuseppe Vecci? Yes, that's his name. Look, run the boy for a month, and then have Vecchi come down and see him. But Vecchi, he's retired! I don't even know if he's in England. Yes, I'll check. You think ... Pass up that pint miss. Well? Is it all fixed? I must be drunk or barmy. Yes, it's fixed. Are you sure Giuseppe's in London? Yeah, they told me he's going to be at the Majestic for a couple of days then he's going to Rome. Tomorrow I'm going take you to see a big time promoter! Ah-ha. Here's to the partnership. - Ha-ha-ha.- And here's to a champion! Now just a minute, you’ve just gone into training. From now on, none of that. - And none of that, either.- Aw, shucks. Somebody here to see you, Sir. - Who is it?- It's Sharkey, Guiseppe. Ah, Sharkey, be with you in a second. Well, what you know, Sharkey? It is very nice you pop in to say hello. It has been a long time. Ha-ha-ha. This is Johnny Flanagan. It's a pleasure, Johnny. Have some coffee, some food. You eaten? Okay. Grab yourself a cigar son. - Grab yourself a chair, Johnny.- Thanks. Ah? Well? How's the Booth? How’s it doing, Sharkey? Did you ever try to make any money out of one? What you got on your mind, Sharkey? Johnny, he's got the makings of a champion, Guiseppe. He'll go all the way. I want you to see him work out when you come back from your Holiday. When I come back from my Holiday I will need a rest! I've seen lots of boys, Sharkey, everyone a champion. Too many champs!Not enough fighters. No offense for your boy, Sharkey, - but you know how it is, eh?- Oh, come on, Guiseppe. Say you'll see him when you get back. You won't regret it. Okay okay, but I don't know how long I'm gone. What's the boy do for a month? Ain't you seen all the sights in London yet? Just about! That's a Lorna, my wife. Been married six months ago. - My last visit to the States.- Your wife? You don't believe, eh? Hey, Lorna! Lorna! Lorna! Do you have to yell all the time? Johnny Flanagan here don' believe you're my wife. Maybe there's some special way a married woman should look. Hah, Junior? Oh, you make a the boy blush, Lorna. Come on, we're wasting our time. Don' get all steamed up. Sit down, sit down, sit down. That is one of Lorna's jokes. She's American, just like me. You're a nice boy, Johnny. Relax. Sharkey, I gave up the fight game when I got married. Didn't think I was going to have the time. But I can always look at another fight, eh? Lorna! She's the boss now. What do you say? We go to the Fair Ground tonight? This is our last night in town! Why spend it slumming in some Fair ground? Sharkey is an old friend, Lorna. All right, have it your way. I've been bored before. It won't be for long. It will be funny and then you show me what he can do, no? - Uh-huh.- Okay. Goodbye, Mrs. Vecchi, be seeing you, Guiseppe. Tonight. Now there's no time for anything! No time at all! - What's the matter with you?- Nothing. Well, listen to me. You got to go in there tonight and win. Do you hear me? Yes, I'll show that dame. [Crowd talking] Let 'er go, Johnny. Use your feet! [Crowd talking] One ... Two ... Three ... Four ... Five ... Six ... Seven ... Eight ... Nine ... Out! Was a good fight, Johnny. We had it fixed, just for you. Ah, nobody fool Gusseppe. I fixed too many boys to believe that one. You don' need fixing. You shape up right, real big. I tell you, Johnny, I got the connections. I handle just you? We go all the way? We get to be a champion, eh? - No strings to him?- Nope. Well ... Well, what's the deal? I take Johnny over on manager's commission; twenty-five percent and I pay all expenses. Try again, Guiseppe. Is there something wrong with 25? No more than is wrong with 15! Look, while you're so busy cutting me up, don't forget to cut in Sharkey, and Charley, heh? Twenty for you, twenty for Charlie and twenty for Sharkey. What's Sharkey cut for? I thought it was Charlie that ... There's no deal without him. He'll be doing the training. Oh, I like what you say Johnny. You speak up well for your friends. Loyalty is a fine thing. You got it for them, you got it for me! Is a good. Is a deal! That's settled then. I have a place in the country. Big house! Bought it cheap. Fellow owed me money. No servants. Lorna and I like to be alone. You all help with the washing up. You and Charlie and Johnny come down to work there, huh? Yes. I promise you, Johnny, I’m a funny man. If I like a boy, I do the best I can. Do you mind if your wife leaves now? I'd like to crawl under a shower. Sure, Johnny, sure. You must be tired. We are both going. It was a tough fight, hah? - Arrividecci.- Goodbye, Guiseppe. We are all going to be one big, happy family. [Laughter] Now stop it! [Guiseppe singing in boat] Yoo-hoo! Now be quick. I'm the anchor. This road work is going to make an old man out of me. What's the matter with you? I feel wonderful! Well you should. You got the bike. No. No, no, anything but water. No! Ha-ha-ha. What's the matter, it's a lovely lake, isn't it? Yeah, smashing. Yes, Guiseppe's, doing us proud, here, all right. - Hey, Johnny?- Yeah. Here, you better get that sweat off in the lake. [Music playing] - Gin!- Ohhh. How many? Pretty good, no? Used to be a taxi-dancer. I took a part interest in the Silver Ring. Over in East 42nd St. And Lorna was thrown in with it. Fifty-three. When I get rid of the Silver Ring, I keep Lorna. Ha-ha. Nice profit, huh? Shut up. So what's wrong with dancing for a living? What's wrong with that kind of life? Is beating the brains out of some stupid slob in the ring any better? No, I don't dance with anyone any more. Why? Because you bought all the tickets when you married me. - I hope you're happy!- Oh, Lorna Perhaps we don't play anymore tonight. I got a confession, Johnny ... Only reason I win all the time, I been cheating. But just a little bit. Honest. Is a shaping up good, eh? Makes me feel young. Pretty soon he'll be ready. Slow and easy does it. We don't want to rush him. Sure, sure, sure, sure. Is a no hurry. When he's good and ready, we go straight to the top! I can't work while she's watching me! - Get her out of here!- What’s a matter? Is a crazy? She do some harm? You can't talk to me like that. What do you think you are? A military secret or something? I'm through! - Now wait a minute, Johnny.- Now relax, Johnny. Lorna, she my wife, she belong here. What’s a matter if she watch? I don' like such attitude. Maybe he don't like women. Lorna, do me a favor, go into the house. The boy is shy. All right, Gipy. Just tell the Body not to flatter himself. I didn't come out here to see him. I've seen better bodies hanging in a butcher shop. Come on, let's get goin'. All right, start. Is a terrible thing. Sharkey, you tell me, what is going on? They just don't get on together. But why? My brain is in a twist. Is something bad about Lorna? I don' understand. Why can't we be just one big happy family? Guiseppe, sometimes people just don't like each other. Now don't say such a thing. - Look, maybe if I - Leave 'em alone. They'll sort it out themselves. - And be friends?- Maybe. Anyway, they'll learn to keep out of each other's way. I'll fix something. Forget it. Forget it? I don't forget it. This is no good! Stop flapping your wings! You’re not even built like an angel! I no leave it like that, not under my roof! Is a all wrong! You wait, I'll make it all right! You see who is built like an angel! Johnny, how's it go this morning? - Okay, I guess.- Everything fine now? Comfortable? Food good? Sleep all right, eh? - Fine.- Good. I try to make it that you are happy, Johnny. Now,how about you make Gueseppe happy, too. Anything you say, Guiseppe. Is a Lorna's birthday today. I give a little party. You and Sharkey come and have a good time, no? I'm in training. Johnny, how often birthday comes? Once a year. Me, I don't dance. I got two left feet. I'm no good at parties. Johnny, there are two things I love. Is a Lorna and my Mama Italy. Now you come into my life I begin to love you too. What you say? You come to party? Make a me happy, no? Okay, but don't expect too much. You a good boy. I arrange a party, nobody has nothing to do but have a good time. You going? What could I do, Sharkey, the poor guy almost broke down. I hadn't got the heart to say no. You should have seen his face. I hope you feel the same when you see Lorna's face. [Crowd talking] Don' she look like a million bucks! Lorna! Here's to Lorna, the most beautiful wife anyone ever had. - Happy Birthday.- Happy Birthday, Lorna. We mustn't pick. Give me a bottle. Charlie, miss a good thing not coming, eh? Just look at us. Just one, big happy family, huh? - Hila Saluta.- Good luck. Come, Lorna. This is special occasion, no? Oh waiter, send more champagne for the party. Guiseppe is enjoying himself, anyway. Come on, Johnny, relax, forget about training tonight. To tell you the truth, I'd much rather be having a glass of beer with Charlie, myself. Cheers. - Ouch!- It is a no good Lorna. I spoil the dancing for you. I have got two left feet. Johnny boy, what do you say? Do me and Lorna a favor, you dance with her, eh? - Do you want to?- I don't mind. I tell you I fix it. They to it to make Guiseppe happy. But what's the difference, I'm no angel, eh? I no make miracles? Well, there's a miracle! That’s enough of a miracle for me! - I beg your pardon.- That's all right. Is a party, eh? 'Just let forever begin tonight Let the wheel of fate be turning and hold me tight 'It's the miracles that happen While this was meant to be 'Not just for a year, but for eternity. 'So take me in your arms and embrace me And with your kiss, excite me. Into your life invite me forever more. I don't care whether 'It's wrong or right Just let 'forever' begin tonight I figured we'd give Guiseppe a break tonight by declaring a truce. - What about tomorrow?- Tomorrow can wait! Guiseppe's awfully drunk. He'll pass out and won't know a thing until tomorrow. All right, Guiseppe, come on. [Guiseppe trying to sing] I'll help put him to bed. It's too hot to sleep. I'm going for a swim. Hey, come on, let's see you do it for yourself! Is a simple! Always I get into bed by myself. It's just a question of doing things right. Cozy. Echo. Huh? Is a simple ... You see, Sharkey, I tell you ... You don' think Guiseppe is a angel. You just think Guiseppe flap his wings. but he fix everything. Just as he said. He fix everything. Yes, Guiseppe, you fixed everything. No, no, no, no Why don't you keep your mind on the job! - It is!- You can't fool me, son. - Your timing's off!- I've had enough! What's the matter with you? Why don't you keep off your feet? What are you thinking of all the time? Don't think about the count alone Keep off, off keep off of 'em. What's happening to us, Lorna? What's happening? Just let it happen, Johnny. Let it happen. - Was the food no good, eh?- It was fine. Then why's everybody acting like they feel sick or something, eh? - Eh?- We're restless. We want a fight. It's supposed to be a surprise, but I tell you, I got you a fight. Matched you with Lou Kossov. - Kossov?- A Liverpool boy. You fight him in a month. - All I've got to do is - Aw, skip the details. - That's not my job.- Not your job? What you mean not your job? Don't talk that talk with me. You listen ... Who you fight ... where ... how ... All of it is your job. Kosov is a good boy. And don't you never get cocky with me. Don't you never try it. No chance about it. What’s a matter with him? He's a bit over trained. Don’t worry. He'll get over it. I promise you. Aren't you glad to see me, Baby? What's come over you? Have I done something wrong? You ought to know. Somebody's found out. It doesn't matter, anyway, it's finished. That's all. Finished! - Why, darling?- Leave me alone. - Don't be like that.- Do it to some other man. Go back to Guiseppe, where you belong. Him? I'd rather die. You're his wife. He's a good guy. You don't know what he's like. To other people, he's Guiseppe. Everybody's friend, and always good for a laugh. But with me ... Its sweat and slobber. He never leaves me alone. I hate him. I hate him more than anyone's ever hated anyone. When he touches me, I have to close my eyes so I can't see him. And when he kisses me,I pretend that it's Johnny. You you! Why should I pretend anymore? You won't have to. Why, Johnny? Why? Because I can't go on. I can’t live with my conscience. I feel dirty. I want no part of this thing you've forced into my life. Go back to him! Let me be what Guiseppe wants! What Sharkey and Charley want. What I want! What about me? What about what I want? Oh, Johnny, I love you. I love you! You don't know what you're doing to me! Please, don't leave. I can't stand it. - I'd die without you.- You'll get over it. - I'll kill myself.- You won’t. I will! You'll see! I'll do it! Lorna. Lorna! - [Lorna crying]- Darling. Darling Well! Won't you come in. I think it's time I had a word with you, Mrs. Vecchi. What about? I'll make it short and sweet. Lay off him. What are you getting at? You don't need to be told. Tomorrow we go to London. Just keep away from Johnny until after the fight, you understand? Yeah, I understand. Only that you're talking out of turn. Why don't you hang a sign around his neck, saying 'Keep Off'. You don't miss a trick, do you? A boy like that hasn't got a chance. I'm warning you, just keep away from him. Go away, Sharkey. Wrap your kid in cotton wool, nobody's going bother him. You know I could go to Guiseppe. You can go anyplace. Personally, I don't even want to go to London. All right, that's all I wanted to know. Hello, Johnny Flanagan. What do you want? It's so good to hear your voice, Johnny. I just had to call you. Didn't Guiseppe say anything about me? He said you weren't feeling so good, and might not be able to make the fight. Where are you? Do you feel better? - I've been to a doctor.- Lorna, what's wrong with you? I'm glad it happened. Glad!It will keep us together. What! What will? Johnny, don't you understand?I'm going to have a baby. Oh Johnny, you must help me. Does Guiseppe know? I can't talk now. I must go. Lorna. Lorna! Lorna! Ladies and gentlemen ... This is a eliminating ... contest of fifteen rounds ... Fifteen rounds ... of the Light Heavy weight Championship of Great Britain, between Lou Kossov of Liverpool. [Applause] And Johnny Flanagan, London. [Applause] Gentlemen, at the weighing in. Kossov weighed twelve stone, seven pounds. Flanagan weighed, twelve stone, three pounds. Gentlemen, you're official for this contest, your referee, Mr. Joe Lewis. Timekeeper, Mr. Perc Speaker. In the center, boys. Referee. Now you, both know the rules. Seconds out. [Talking in background] [Applause and talking] Hello Lorna. He's better. He was not good at the start but now he pick up. That's better. Now keep it that way. Nearly had him. You're boxing, Johnny. You're boxing all right. Seconds out. [Crowd talking] Aaah! Four ... Five ... Six ... Seven ... Eight ... Nine ... Ten years and such a thing happens to me. Ten years! Is a bad business. I put a lot of money on the boy. Lost a bundle. I been thinking ... You know that I think? - Maybe I make a mistake.- Maybe you did. I’m a disappointed man. For months I get all worked up. For what? So everything comes down on me like a ton of bricks! What's the matter? Getting old? Yes, getting old. Was a bad fight, no? No, it wasn't a bad fight. It was bad luck. Maybe. Let's get it straight, Guiseppe.You want to get out? - Yes, I want out.- You're out! Come on, let's go. No, no, I ... Oh, don't go like that. Johnny, have you got nothing to say? - I'm sorry.- And that's all? I should have won. I'm sorry I didn't. I ... I wish I hadn't let you down. Is just like a candle has got blown out. I can't light it again. I like you, Johnny. I want to see you make a good. Ah tell you what I do. You all come back to the house with me and you stay 'til Sharkey has got something lined up, huh? Okay, Guiseppe, we'll take you up on that. No hard feelings, eh? Forget it, Guiseppe. You'll be at the ringside yelling your head off when I win my next fight. See you in the car. You bet my life, I yell my head off. Is he giving you the air? He don't like it when things go wrong. You're coming back to the house, aren't you? - Goodnight, Guiseppe.- Goodnight, Guiseppe. Goodnight, boys. Have you told him yet? No. We to got to play it smart, Johnny. Be best for both of us. I've messed up everything. We'll work something out. I'm a fighter, that's all I was born for. For these ... I'll never fight again when Guiseppi finds out. I’ll be finished. He'll see to that. Poor Guiseppe. Poor, fat, guy. Got himself trapped with a fine dame, didn't he? Forget Guiseppe! I can't, he'll go through hell when he finds out. It'll kill him. If that happens there's no problem anymore. You're wasting your time with that sort of talk. He's a rich man, Johnny, and I'm his wife. What are you getting at? Something could happen, you could make it happen. - It's an idea, Johnny.- You must be mad! You've got to do something! Well, we can we can go away. I'll get a job. Washing dishes? You can keep it! I lived like that until Gippy came along. I've had that. - I'll think of another way.- There is no other way! Either you'll listen to me, or I'll work things out my way! But you've got to give me a chance! You've hand your 'chance'. - Oh, no ...- All right. Keep out of my way! And don't come crying to me when things go wrong. I'm through with you. - Lorna, I want ...- Hey Johnny... We're going into town. I've got to send some telegrams. You want to come along? Well, you can't moon around here all day. You go ahead, Sharkey. I'll go across to the barn. If I'm going to work in your booth, I'd better get back into training. Lorna, we can't go on like this. I must talk to you. - Save it.- I won't. I won't just sit by and keep quiet. You must come away before he finds out. Look. Don't get ideas! Let me worry about it. You go back where you came from, get lost! Now, wake up, like me. You'll soon forget. Why should a baby worry you. - Lorna, please I ...- Careful. Guiseppe's got good eyesight. Ha, I must's been crazy getting soft for you like that. Guess it must have been the body. But it won't happen again. Any answer, sir? No. - Here.- Thanks. Johnny! Johnny! Charley! Hey, look, fellas. Look what I got. Look, Gallagher is touring Scotland. He said I could have a booth and fifty percent if I could dig up my own fighters and be ready in three days! [Yelling and dancing with happiness] He's going hysterical. Your enthusiasm is killing me. Once we're back in harness, Johnny boy, everything will be fine! Look Johnny, you don't have to come if you don't want to. I'm sorry, fellas. I don't know what's got into me the last few days. Oh, forget about it, that fights all over and done with. Scotland will be smashing! Sharkey! Charley! Oh! Is a ... Is a ... Charley! Charley, is a ... Is a ... is a party. Is a party! Is a big a bambino Oh, what I say? Ah, I'm a poppa. - What?- Yeah! Just think of that. A poppa, son of padre. Lorna just tell me. Guiseppe, she tell me, look like you got a bambino! Is a wonderful, eh? Is a marvelous, eh? 'mer-vi-ossa' Ha-ha-ha. To my bambina - To Guiseppe's bambina.- Bambina. Hey, Johnny, what you say? I bet it’s a boy! What do you think? Look a like me or Lorna. Like me? Bit fat, maybe, but pretty smart, heh? Bet he's be pretty smart, eh? I bet he'll be a fighter, just like you. Ha! Lorna! You know what? I make up my mind, Mr. and Mrs. Guiseppe Vecchi with their little bambino go to Italy. Right away. Let's see, I send a telegram to Mama. No more fight business, eh? Settle down, eh? Be with my mama and sister. Just one big family. Is a good idea. Ah, Lorna, is a good to know I be a Poppa. Play musica. Ah! Is a party! Come on, let's drink to the future. Let's all get drunk, huh? Ah, it's a party! The best time we ever had! [Guiseppe singing] What was the idea? I've got plans to make, just like you have. Poor Guiseppe, how could you do a thing like that to him? Poor Guiseppe, my eye, why don't you grow up. He dropped you quick enough. One bad fight and he drops you. Johnny, must we be like this to each other? Why did you do it, Lorna? Why? When I heard you were going, I had to do something. - I had to hurt you, Johnny.- Oh, Lorna. But it doesn't have to be like that. Like I told you, something could happen. We could do it easily. Look ... I signed a false name at a drugstore in London. Lorna! You're crazy! - You don't understand.- Only that's it murder. Johnny, I'd do anything for you. If you won't do it, I'll do it. All right, give it back to me! - Johnny! Give it back to me!- No! Forget it! I'll do it! Johnny Darling I love you, Lorna, but I can't do this. I I can't. Then, find another way, Johnny, for my sake. Find another way. [Music playing] Aren't you going fishing today, Gippy? Is that beautiful, my song. I never get tired of it. Something you can remember me by. Oooh! [Music playing] Thank you. - Where you going, Johnny?- Come fishing with me. Oh, no, I have got to have the shave first. Too brutal with that barber. - You wait for me.- No I guess I'll go for a ride. What? In this heat? Maybe I'll sweat off a pound or two. Johnny! Johnny ... What's the matter? You know I can't swim. Can't see him! Guiseppe! He must be lying down. Guiseppe! Where's Guiseppe, he did take the boat out, didn't he? Of course. Guiseppe! Guiseppe! Why doesn't he wake up?Something must have happened! Guiseppe! Guiseppe! Come on, let's get in the dinghy. There's no oars! - In the boathouse.- All right. He was a big man. Fat. He woke up not feeling well. - Heart?- Hangover. He could have just overbalanced. You say he couldn't swim. - Mr. ...?- Flanagan. Mr. Flanagan. The others have explained their movements to my satisfaction. - Now, where were you?- Me? - At the time of the accident.- I wasn't here. So I'm told. Where, then? - I went for a ride?- Yes. Down by the lanes. I had a rest on the grass and went to sleep. - Oh?- When I got back ... they told me. I see ... That's all, I ... I don't know any more. We all saw him leave, Inspector. And he didn't' get back until after the police got here. Thank you. I think that'll do. I'm sorry to have distressed you. I know how you feel. Accidents will happen. Oh, you won't be leaving before the inquest. Very good. Come on, Johnny, let's go and get a breath of fresh air. Well, I've got to go and pack all the training gear. I wonder what I should do about Guiseppe's family? That lawyer that was in London probably cabled them. Cabled them? Sure, they'll be turning up here any day now. Here? I won't have them here. I won't! I don't see what else you can do about it. I should have thought you would have enjoyed playing the grief stricken widow. Mrs, Vecchi? Oh, we got your cable. I'm Sharkey. The wife? She could not come to meet us? Uh, no, I'm sorry. - Can I help you with those?- Oh, thank you. This way, please. I'm Lorna. I'm glad you arrived safely. Does she not have black clothes? Have you no black to wear? Would you like some tea, or something cool? It's a very hot day. You must be tired. One is not tired when one seeks for truth! - Will you be staying long?- As long as is necessary. Well, the inquest is on Tuesday. Inquest? It does what? It is official. It will say how he dies. Sunstroke heart ... And this young man it? Si, mama. You are the boy, eh? You are very young. In my game, you have to be. My brother liked you very much. And you? - You liked him? Yes?- Yes. What does the boy say? He says he liked Guiseppe. [Says something in Italian] If you've got something to say,say it so we can all understand. My Mama say you are nervous. Why? You've had a long journey. You should have a rest. Do not tell us what we need. After hearing the evidence of the various witnesses, and giving due consideration to all the circumstances. I find that the deceased Guiseppe Carleto Vecchi met his death as a result of drowning, which, in the opinion of this court, was accidental. - You know, don't you, Sharkey?- Yes, Johnny. I know. You want me to tell you how I ... No, I can guess but why? That's all, tell me why? She's going to have my kid. I couldn't let Guiseppe take it and I can't let Lorna down. There was nothing else to do. I can't go on. She's really got you, hasn't she? That dame got you so twisted, you didn't know what you were doing. That old Italian woman, she knows. I'm afraid of her, Sharkey. I'm scared of her. I can't stand it! You keep your head, son. We'll get you out of this place. Come on. - We're leaving!- No! Johnny, I won't let you! Try and stop us, you've done enough already. No! No! I love you! I love you! Oh, Johnny, I won't let you. Johnny, please, don't do this to me. - Johnny!- Come on, Johnny. Please, Johnny, let me take care of you. Like you took care of Guiseppe? Johnny's mine, Guiseppe never was. Nina, tell them both what an old lady knows. Tell them all, so that the boy can judge. Si Mam. My Mama is sorry for you. She say you have been a fool. You are young, but she is different. She knows. Guiseppe send telegram. He say he is to be poppa, but that is not so, is it? What do you mean? Nina, she is not with child. My mama say you are not with child. Not Guiseppe's not anybody's. My mama an old woman, she knows these things. There is an expression on the face of a woman that tell us. Let her tell you. There is no child with her, and she know it. - You lie!- I tell the truth! My brother was a rich man. Now you have his money. Much good may it do for both of you. You must talk to me! Poor Guiseppe. Poor fat guy. He died all for nothing! It wasn't for nothing, Johnny. It was, because I'm going to tell the police. You can't. Johnny, I love you. We'll go away someplace. Nobody can stop us. South America, anyplace There's enough money. We'll forget. It's too late to forget it, Lorna. There's no point in it anymore. All I want is for you to leave me alone, you've done enough. Get out of my sight! Go away and stay away! Johnny ... darling Honey, we're a pair. Two of a kind. We've got to stick together, we've got to. Oh, can't you understand? Life doesn't mean anything otherwise. It doesn’t make any difference to me now. I'm dead already. Get out! The only other people I want to see are the police. If you do that ... What about me? I don't care what happens to you! Get out! Get Out! He's had nothing all day. I've made him some soup. Get him to eat it. He'll take it from you. I'm going out. - Here, have this.- Later. - No, now, come on, son.- Leave it there. Okay, but I want to see that bowl empty when I come back. - I promise, Sharkey.- Good. Couple of pals, you and Charlie. We won't let you down, son. How was Johnny? I tapped on his door about an hour ago, still asleep I suppose. - Lorna back yet?- I haven't heard her. Johnny ... Johnny! What made you do it, Johnny boy?What made you do it! She drove you to it. Drove him to it! That tramp! That dirty tramp! She won't get away with it this time, Charlie. Not again she won't. Go and phone the inspector, tell him we've got Guiseppe's murderer. The real murderer. Charlie! We'll fix her good and proper! Well, hurry, will ya. We'll be waiting Inspector. Inspector? He's coming over, be here in a few minutes. Johnny? Go and see for yourself. - What are you doing in there?- Fixing you. It's not often suicide can be made to look like murder. You can't pin a thing like that on me. - No? It's pinned already.- What? The stuff he used is in your room. Just try and find it before the Inspector does. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Here it is! Hurry, hurry, hurry! A five pound note to any one of the boys that can stand up against one of my challengers. One five-pound note. One shilling to come in and see the best man win. Come on, lady, one shilling to see nature in the raw. [Laughter] Now then, where's a lad with some guts! Here we are. There's a fine, brave boy. Now step inside and watch him win his way to fame and fortune. Get him some boots & trunks. Step inside everyone the fight is about to commence. Hurry, hurry, hurry!
