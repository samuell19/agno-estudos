When night falls And the moon is full The sea breeze blows gently There's no wind. Sending the love In a beautiful rhythm Reciting sadness And fragility Paddle properly, please! The playground For beautiful maidens Tanjung Katong With its bluish water That's how you should sing it! The playground For beautiful maidens Those who are close to us Are being missed -Listen! -Even we far-- What is it? Are you hearing what I'm hearing? Have I not told you that even though you're seeing something unusual, do not respond! I did not see it! I heard it! That's the same thing! You're such a clown! It's gone now. Probably. But do you know what people have said about this? If we can hear it, that means that it's far away. But if we can't hear it, this means that... Langsuir! LANGSUIR And after the incident, they've stopped going fishing at night at Sungai Bakau. Why is that? It's because of the langsuir, that's why! Why are you laughing? The friend to my friend told me that the fish they caught had disappeared too! Therefore I have a feeling that these langsuirs are descendants of thieves. I'm confident! It's not "langsiaq"! It's pronounced as "langsuir". -What do you know about it? -But let me tell you this, the langsuir has an appetite for raw fish. Maybe. But your raw stuff there, surely it will like it more! What kind of joke is that? Lan, please don't laugh! I'm just saying. Have you ever heard this story about the langsuir? For the langsuir if one can hammer a nail into her head... it can change into a beautiful woman. Beautiful and gorgeous, just like an angel. -What is it Mal? -An angel! Nonsense! An angel? That's nice. -I have an idea! -What is it? Other than going fishing tonight, let's catch ourselves a langsuir too! I like your spirit. Okay, calm down. I don't think I want to hear any more stories about langsuir, satan or demons. I'm here to enjoy myself with you guys! -But before that, what should we do? -Swimming! -Let's take a picture! -Say "artiste"! One, two, three. This universe is filled with secrets. This place seems to have summoned me. To explore a mysterious realm. But does it really exist? -What's that? -Don't move! Relax, guys! Let me slay this animal! Man, wait. Why do you want to slay it? We can't slay it? -Do you want to chase it away? -Be careful! Slowly. Can you do it, Lan? Slowly. Look at that. It runs away. Let it go! Luckily, I did not slay it. These species are everywhere in the trees. Please be careful. Let's make a move. It's okay. Let's go! -We're now at sea and we have... -What do we have? We have a lot. -Give me your names? -Zaman and Kamal. Pak Akob! Please be careful, Uncle. How was your catch today, Pak Akob? Just got to fill my container here. Pak Akob, it's still early. Are you going back already? Who told you that I'm going back? I'll be sleeping here tonight. It's dark already. Of course, I should be going home. Why are you guys still here? We're going to spend the night at Pulau Anak Langsuir. So you want to spend the night at Pulau Anak Langsuir? You guys just like to play around, do you? Hey, don't you ever joke around about this! The island is a place for langsuirs. A lot of ghosts and demons! Go find another place to camp. But don't go to that island! Don't be angry. They're just kidding. Myself and Lan, we're not that brave actually. I can see you guys aren't that brave. Okay, I'm going back! You guys should head back too! -Peace be upon you! -Don't go there! -Peace be upon you! -Upon you be peace. We have arrived! -What are you waiting for? -Hey take your bags! Please carry these things, Din. Don't create a ruckus here. You don't want them to be angry! Who will be angry? Lan! The machete. Lan! The machete! Please ask for permission before you cut anything. Don't just randomly cut. Okay, Lan! We will have a good trip. Like in the past The first girl That I can't forget you Okay! I wish I could live with you Look at my fish! Hold on! Hey, guys! You are still pretty Like I saw you last time You are an artiste, therefore you should sing properly. -I have an idea. -What is it? Food is ready. Let's eat! What are we waiting for? -Pass me the plates! -I want the crab. Is this enough? It should be enough for everyone. -Hurry up! -Be patient! Lan, let's eat! The big one is mine. I'm asking for your permission to spend the night here. Please do not disturb us. -We're asking for the same too! -Stop playing around! -Are you hallucinating? -To whom are you talking? Something's not right with this guy. Let's eat first. I seek forgiveness in God. I seek forgiveness... Peace be upon you. Could you tell me who you are? My name is... Suri. What is your name? My name is Azlan. Azlan. The music from your flute is very soothing. Azlan, the first beat is when I first saw your face. The second beat is when I hear your music. And the third beat... is when I look deep into your eyes. My heart feels as if there is something extraordinary. Can the place be any further than this? That was in daytime. Now it's already nightfall. I reckon it's on the other side. Where is that fishing spot? What's your problem? -What? -Do you see that? You're seeing this, right? -That's Lan! -Yes! Just look at your friend, he's got a girl, and he's keeping her to himself. Don't you find this odd? We're on an island, in the middle of the night suddenly there's a beautiful girl. That's why! Probably that's the langsuir. I don't care what she is a human or even a demon but she's really beautiful. I know what my plan is tomorrow. Let's go! Damn! Man, wait for me! This is the main gateway for me to leave my world to meet you, Azlan. Hold me closely, Azlan. I'd like to take you on a flight to reach the furthest star. I call this peak as... The Black Rock Peak. I come here often during full moon. Because every time I'm standing here... I feel like as if I could touch... the moon. Have a look at that area. The village looks beautiful at night. My house is at the cape. Who do you live with in this island? I'm not staying here all alone. There are others... who are accompanying me now. They are very shy. Our kind, our real appearance are too horrifying in the eyes of your kind. But you look pretty to me. I look pretty in your eyes? One day, you'll know. Man! What are you doing? You're making too much noise. I can't sleep. -Do you see this? -What is that? This is the nail that will be hammered into the langsuir's head. There are a lot of girls in KL, but why do you still want to pursue a langsuir? Lan, I think before I have the chance to hammer the langsuir's head I would probably hammer your head first. Why are you acting this way? What's wrong with you? Do you have a problem with me? That's a good question. Yes, I do have a problem with you! When you met that gorgeous girl last night, did you inform us? -Did you? -No! Mal, please talk to this guy. Stop pretending, Lan. We both saw her last night. You were happily dating with her inside the cave. You should share her with us! I'm good if you want to have fun with her by yourself. But tonight, I'll wait for her, and I'll hammer her head with this nail. When she has changed into a pretty girl, who wants to join me? -Me! -You? You? You want to join me? Tonight, all of us will capture the langsuir and then let's have fun with her, are you brave enough? Why? Because I'm not like your friend here! He devours just one fish like a hungry cat. I'm not a womanizer like you! -You're just the same. -And why are you angry? Keep calm! Don't be upset. If you're not the type who does not like to share, help me to call her tonight. -Drop it, Man! -I'm okay! But you ask your friend there, if he's okay or not. -Pass me the rope! -You're being silly! That's for a Siamese ghost story. We're dealing with a Malay ghost here. A rope? For real? I don't care if I'm being silly, but what I know is that we're dealing with devils and demons here. The forsaken satan! Whatever they are! Loosen it. You such a joke. Lan, why don't you play this flute to call out the langsuir? So you really want me to play the flute? What happened? Say some prayer! It's shaking the tree! Okay. If the langsuirs come to attack us... my grandmother once told me that these langsuirs do not like to see naked men. Then, let's just get naked. My grandma also said the same thing. Stop joking around at this hour! Let's go back, Alias! Take the bag. Hey, langsuir, come down here if you dare! What's wrong with you? Let's go. -Let's bring him back! -Let's go! Don't bring that ropes. Hurry up! What ghost are haunting us? Quick, take that thing. Hold on, we're close! -Put him here! Put him here! -It stings! Here's some water. It stings! I can't open my eyes! Slowly clean it up. Don't rush. Damn it! It spitted on my face! Did it think that my face is like a sink? That's probably because it likes you! Stop fooling around! Are you sure that was a demon? Maybe it might just be some bird droppings? Are you mad? I saw it on the tree. It's all black! In that case it's confirmed! There are demons in this island! I thought you guys were only joking. I want to go back tomorrow! I don't care! That's a good idea! If you guys want to marry or fall in love with the demons, we don't care! We're both going back tomorrow. Lan, follow us back, okay? I don't want to be a part of this. I'm going to sleep now. Damn you, Lan! You are okay, right? -It was spit. -It was only a little bit right? The spit was nasty. You didn't feel it, you won't know! I'm going to sleep now. Hope she won't spit me again. Damn it. It has been told that for this langsuir, if one can hammer a nail into her head it can change into a beautiful woman. Beautiful and gorgeous, just like an angel. Come to me The moon and the stars Are accompanying My lonely nights Please appear next to me -Wake up! -Why? Faster! I'm continuing the mission. Who's with me? Better be quick! Do not meet the human. They are planning something sinister towards you. How do you know that? I saw it myself. One of them was holding a very sharp nail. His body was tied to a rope... and calling us out with a flute. What was their intention? They will destroy you! They'll turn you into a weak human being. And when you are weak, you will be their victim. Because it's human nature to prey on the weak. But the guy's attitude is very different, Kak Dewi. He's very kind. The way he talks... and how he looked at me... captivated me. I... have just felt love. Please, do not stop me! Love? You still want to go? He's already calling me, Kak Dewi. I miss him dearly and I need to see him. Please, do not stop me. You have to remember. The arch-enemies to our kind are humans and love. Because of love, they could slaughter you, my dear sister. Please grant me the permission to go. Just for the last time tonight. I promise you just for tonight. Just go. If you truly love him. Wish him farewell. Or all of them will die in my hands! Thank you, Suri, for coming. I miss you dearly, Azlan. I saw you from a far, with your friends. But I didn't dare to get any closer. Suri, I beg you, please do not appear in front of my friends. They have got some ill-intentions towards you. Yes, I know. What I've realized is that you are not like them. I feel safe... when I'm by your side. You're the first person... who'd made me fallen in love. My, oh, my. Won't it be good if we're now in our tents resting? Why all the fuss? Why are you causing a ruckus? Have you eaten a soup full of nails? If not, just be quiet! Why are you being a coward? If you guys do not want to follow me, just stay here! Kamal! Follow me! Let's find Lan. Just go, if you think you're brave enough! Hey, you guys, don't be away for too long! We'll wait here! That's enough! So what are we going to do here? If we follow them, at least I could take some photos when the langsuir appears. Now I can only take photos of you guys being silly here! You talk too much. Can you be a bit polite? I have something to ask you. When we were in a group just now, why were you in the middle, not in the front or the back? It's because you're a coward! That's why! As if you're so brave! There's a hut here. It looks decent. Alias, don't be too brave. This is illogical. How could there be a hut in a middle of a jungle? Let's take shelter. This is just a home. What if we see--? It's just wind. No, it's not. How could the wind choose which tree it will shake? True. It's only shaking this tree. Don't react to it. Don't shine on it. What is it? What's wrong with you? Look at that! Why do I have such a long hair? -That's not your hair. -It's the langsuir! Help me! Get up! Run! Have I not told you? Don't be arrogant! But no one's listening! Alias. What are you waiting for? Get in the tent now! -Come here Alias! -Alias! What is it? Did you remember what Lan used to say? If we ever see the thing, we just need to strip. Are you sure? -You strip first. -You should! Let's do this together! I'll count one to three. Then we strip. Okay! Wait. One. Two. Three. It's gone now! Yes, it's gone. -Lan is correct. -Yes! He was right. It run away. Why did you throw it to me? No wonder it's gone. It was not because we stripped! -You pulled out its hair. -No, I didn't. I think when I was in the tent, I accidentally touched it. You didn't just touch it, I think you pulled it. What if it gets angry? It comes back! Run! Suri. Please allow me to send you back. Please don't. That's not your world. Just wait for me here. Whenever you miss me, just play the flute. And I will come to you. Goodbye! My love of the night. Hey, clown! Zaman! Suri! Zaman! Suri! This way, Suri. Suri. Help! Press the nail, Azlan! I want to be with you! Don't leave me in agony! Quick! Suri. -Quickly leave this place! -Suri! Suri, I will not leave! I will not leave you alone! Kak Dewi will slaughter you! Where are you my sister? Suri! Don't ever be fooled by the deception of humans! Trust me! Human beings are evil! Suri! I swear to you, I will slaughter all of them! Hurry up! It might be close! I'm just following him! That's him. -Where else could we hide? -How do I know? Even our tents have been seized by the langsuir! How about my camera? It's expensive! Stop thinking about your camera! We are now being chased by a langsuir, forget about the camera! You're too much! I'm worried about the camera. What if the langsuir had stolen it? So what if it had taken it? Even if the langsuir stole your camera, it might be frightened to even see its own face, do you know that? Everyone's afraid now! Be alert! It might just appear! Beware. What's wrong with you? That hurts! Eron, why does your hand feel cold? Run! Zaman. Zaman! Zaman. Zaman! Get lost, satan! Man! Man. Man, let's go! What's happening? Enough! Let's go! Udin, Eron! Help me! Alias! You're still alive? Stop pushing me! You shouldn't have kissed me! How could you leave me sleeping on that tree all alone? Wake up! Mommy! That thing is touching me! Help me, mommy! Alias, you're back! It's daytime. Praise to God! Dear God, please extend our daytime. We don't want to have night time. Please help us. We were too scared earlier. Amen. Alias. Eron. Whatever happens, we have to go back today, okay? Let's go. Quick! Guys, our boat is missing. Who took our boat? Where's our boat? Surely Zaman and Kamal took it, and left us here. Hey! Help! Are you okay? What happened? -What are you guys searching for? -Our boat. Our boat is missing! What happened to you? Who made this? There are cuts everywhere. Damn it! -Surely Azlan did this! -Kamal, watch your mouth! I know him. He won't do this to us, understand! You shut up! Don't make me nail your head, just like what I did to the langsuir last night. So it is true that you've nailed the langsuir's head? What were your guys thinking? Are you nuts? -Shut up! -Enough! It's your fault and we also had to pay for it! -I don't care! -Kamal! I need to teach you to watch your mouth! My mouth? Let me ask you, whose idea that made us sleep here in the first place? Go to hell! Answer me, was it me or you? Don't touch me! Other than fighting here it's better for us find a way to get us from this island! Unless you want to be the langsuir's prey. Not me. Not me! I just want to go home! But where's Azlan? This is my usual hiding place... whenever I want to get away from my world. It's beautiful. The wind here is quite soothing. At the other side of this lake is my village. But you won't be able to see it with your eyesight. Suri... will you be returning to your world? It's the first time for me to feel the sunlight... on my face. Suri. You have not answered me. Azlan... as long as the nail remains in my head, I'll be always be with you. Because the nail can only be removed by your hands. If that happens, I will be gone forever. I will never remove the nail, Suri. I just want to be with your forever. Lan! Azlan! It's getting dark, Suri. -I'll come back later. -Just go ahead, Azlan. But will you be able to find your way there? And find your way back here? Suri... I swear that I'll be back to see you here. Don't let your swear become our curse. You should go. I hope the langsuir will not terrorize us tonight. No one is allowed to recite any forms of spell or charm that could call out that devil again! Listen to me. I'm really worried about Lan. It's already dark. -Where is he? -Poor Lan. How could you leave us here? Alias, watch your mouth, okay? You know him, right? I also know him. I'm sure he won't do this to us. I have a feeling that our boat... was stolen by the langsuir. They could fly, but why do they still need a boat? Probably because after flying for so long, they also needed the rest. Stop it, before I smack your heads! Have I not told you to not speak of that devil at this hour? The more you speak of it, the closer it'll get. Understand? Alias. Why? It came. What's up? There's nothing there. There's a woman behind Zaman. All of us saw something just now. It's gone! Where are they? Let's go. Help me to work on this tent. Later. Zaman? Hey, Zaman! Man? -Please stop joking, Zaman. -Man? Are you okay, Man? Calm down, Zaman! Oh, Zaman! Man, are you okay? What have you done? You've killed him, Din! He was going to slaughter Eron! Didn't you see that? You've killed him! Damn you! -Damn you. -Calm down. Didn't you see that he was trying to murder Eron? You clown! You guys started all this! Do you realize that? If you guys did not hammer the nail into the langsuir's head, none of this would have happened! And they wouldn't have attacked us! But this is what you want, right? That's great! Serves you right! Serves us right too! We are all doomed! Man. Man. Man. Please wake up. I know that you heard me. Please wake up. I feel guilty. It was an accident. I swear. Man. Man. It's here! Please wake up! Please wake up! Hey, take a look. Look. That thing has taken Zaman! Where has it taken him? Into the jungle. It was scary! -Kamal, where are you going? -Where did it take him? He brought him into the jungle. -I don't care. I need to help Zaman! -No, you can't! It's dangerous! -Go to hell! -No, Kamal! Kamal! We are going to die. If you guys want to stay here, it's not a problem. -Let Kamal and me go find Zaman. -Alias! Alias! Wait for me! Zaman, where are you? Zaman! Hey, satan! Damn you! Do you think I'm afraid of you? Where have you taken Zaman? Damn you! Zaman. Zaman. Zaman! Zaman. Man. Please wake up! Man, please wake up! Man. I don't have anyone now. Please wake up! Man, it's me, Kamal. Let's go! That's not you! Are you scared? Damn you, satan! Where are we now, Alias? Alias? Where are we? This place looks spooky. Wait for me. I don't think Kamal came here. He's afraid of the dark. He won't come here. We shouldn't go. Let's wait at the base. Let's wait at our tents. Read some prayers. Go! Go! Let's jump. I'll go first. My God! Quick. What should we do now? Zaman and Kamal are gone. Oh, my God. -Be patient! They are all in there! -I saw them! Hold on! Let me think! Let's save them! God, please help us! We need to save them. Alias, follow me. -Let's save them! -I can't. Din! It's me! Where did you go, Lan? I thought you're already dead. Actually, I've been searching for you guys for so long, but I couldn't find any of you. Din, Suri took me away. We were hiding from her sister. Our boat is missing and now Zaman and Kamal are in that place with that thing. I'm not sure if they're dead or alive. -I don't' know what to do now, Lan. -Zaman and Kamal are in there? They're in there. They've been killed. Tomorrow, let's find our boat and then you guys should go back! What are you talking about? This is ridiculous! You want us to leave you? You're not going back? Come to me Oh, my God. The moon and the stars Are accompanying Din, Suri is calling me. Suri is calling me. Lan, please don't go! Please appear next to me Don't go. I long For your presence My dearest Your love The flute of love The calmness Amplifies In my soul Dearest night, please spread my love. Dearest leaves, please hear about my longing for love. Dearest moon, please accompany my soul mate. So that he could find his way... to come back to me. Kamal. Wake up, Mal! It's me, Zaman. Wake up! Kamal, please wake up! Oh, Kamal. Lan! Azlan! Eron! Alias! I think the boat has always been here all this while. But we were not able to see it. Praise to God. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. Don't be rude! Please realize that you are human! You should be more honorable than me! What did you say? Honorable? We are the same! You should know that! No one is more honorable than the other. Damn you, langsuir! Where do you think you are going? My love! I've been searching for you high and low in this island! You're really good at hiding. Let go of me! The more you resist, the more I'm enjoying it. Zaman! Azlan! Man! Why do you want to protect this devil? -You're the devil! -I'm the devil? -Hey, Zaman! -Are you crazy? Calm down, Zaman! You're hitting me for this devil? I don't want to fight you, Zaman! I did not ask for this, Lan! -Zaman, calm down, Zaman! -Back off! I'll slaughter you! You stay there. This is between me and Lan. Don't, Lan. Lan! Azlan! Lan! Azlan! Azlan! Zaman! Zaman! Wake up! Suri. Suri, I am so sorry. I did not come for you yesterday. That's all right. I'm already happy just to see you now. Because I love you so much. I have to... leave you forever. Suri. Suri. What are you saying Suri? I will not leave you here Suri. I will not leave you! Please go back, Azlan. You have to save yourself. My sister will slaughter all of you! Your sister can't slaughter me! You have to go back with me, Suri! When I'm back, I'll make you my wife! My world and your world can never be united. We are not from the same kind. Please go! Just leave me and my family in this island. When the time comes... God will annihilate us. Suri, I will not leave you here. I will bring you back. Azlan. If you really love me... I would like you to grant my request. Please remove the nail that has been hammered into my head. When the time comes, just leave me. I will always be here. -Leave! Just leave! -Suri! Please allow me to see your face for the last time, Suri. Go! Go! Go! There you are! I found you at last! Hey, kids! Where have you been all this while? Everyone on the village has been looking for you! But we were only gone for three days. Three days? Are you out of your mind? You guys were missing for more than a month! Do you know that? The story does not end here. What I have experienced in that journey seemed more like a nightmare. I'm still hoping that the dream would turn into reality. So that I could be reunited again with the lady by the name of Suri. Come to me The moon and the stars Are accompanying My loneliness
