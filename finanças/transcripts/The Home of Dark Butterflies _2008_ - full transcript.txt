Johansson. I want to see you in my office. - Now? - Now. - But Salmi can't... - Salmi will help my wife in the garden. Maybe your parents have come to take you home. - What have you done now? - Nothing. Sit down. - The situation is... - Don't they want me back? Juhani. Yourparents have died. Their car drove off the road. It looks like it was intentional. I am sorry. Here are some photos and other things they left behind. Yourfatherwanted me to give you this letterwhen you get out. I wanted you to know about it. When you get ouf of here, you will be stronger than otherpeople. People will admire you because you are tough. You can take anything. Anything. Are you sure this is the place? Or maybe he was buried overthere? - Like Baltsu. Who is Baltsu? - Our dog. Juhani, where is Baltsu's grave? Juhani, wait! - Take that one ifit's not too heavy. - Of course it's not. Did you hurt yourself? Come here. You cut yourself. Take your shirt off. I have to clean the wound. Yourparents did that? I'm sorry. I don't have parents. It was my stepfather. He wanted to fuck or beat me up all the time. Especially when he was drunk. He didn't care who it was. I thought your past wouldn't be as bad as the others'. Why else would I be here then? I would think you would go mad after something like that. I mean, Olavi tells me you are so strong... and hard-working and reliable. - I mean... - What? - Nothing. It doesn't matter. - Yes, it does. You are a fine woman. You're the finest woman I have ever seen. - You are totally different from the others. - What are you talking about? I don't want to leave this place. I don't want to leave this place because then I wouldn't see you anymore. You can't be serious. You must have made a bet with the boys. You can't make fun of me. Salmi, come to my office. Sit down. Tell me why you tried to kill your stepfather. We both know you tried to kill him. You stabbed him four times; that's why you are here. What's all this about? Forget it. I shouldn't have asked. I just wanted to know. Why? I wanted to know why someone wants to kill a person. How does one develop an uncontrollable urge to kill? Do you understand? - No. - Why didn't you warn him? - What? You wouldn't be sitting here now if you had wamed him. You should have said: "Keep that up and I'll kill you." If you are convincing enough, they know you mean it. "Keep that up and I'll kill you." Simple as that. Do you understand? - How are things with Irene? - What? - How are things with my wife? - Fine. That's great. I told her that you have the stamina to do any kind ofjob. Excuse me. Juhani did not show up for dinner. Juhani! Hedgehog! He's here! Help me get him up! It's 39,6 degrees. He will be alright. His brain is just burning. Welcome back. I was getting a bit worried. You have to keep them humid. You must not let them get dry. What do you think? As soon as you're better, you can join in. The eggs will be taken to the greenhouse in the spring. Silkworms are very sensitive to disease. They must be protected. I want you to know one thing. This butterfly project was your dad's idea. - My dad's idea? - Yourfather was talented in many ways. On the other hand, to bigger birds, the world is like a cage. Do you understand what I mean? Silkworm butterflies, Bombyx mori in Latin, spin cocoons from which silk is made. The wings are white with yellow stripes, and the wingspan is 70-80 millimeters. They're blind, they have no digestive tract and they cannot survive outside captivity. The silkworms are 7-8 centimeters long. They are bald, grey and... - What is so funny, Simola? - I just thought of something. - What did you think of? - Nothing. Keep quiet then. - Mulberry leaves have to be dicked... - Quiet, boys. I mean, they have to be picked. If something goes wrong at the cocoon phase, the moth becomes black. - May I ask a question? - Yes. Are the black worms a lot longerthan the white ones? Silkworm butterflies live fora yearortwo. One cold winter is enough to destroy them. We have Christmas here t00. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds retumed glorifying and praising God... for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them. Let's eat. Salmi, would you pass the fish. Roasting pork takes a lot of patience. You have to stay up all night. Freshly butchered pork is the best. - Irene, how about Jesus' blood? - What? Oh, no. - Why isn't Tyyne here? - Because of this little piggy. Go and sit in Santa's lap. Dad will take a picture. - Santa has a gift for you. - Go now. Santa can't wait all night. Irene, sit in Santa's lap, and we'll take a nice photo. How about a smile? That's it. One more. Beautiful. I heard you spend all your time here. - Who told you? - What do you mean? Never mind. I'm leaving tomorrow. I wanted to say bye to you. Bye then. - Where is he going? - To see Vanamo. Damn it. He's a quite stud. What are you doing? You want to see them fuck? What if Tyyne or Salmi sees you? Salmi will kill you. Tell me his name. Whore! Who are you sleeping with? Whose children are they? - I am not blind! - You're crazy. You want to go to the dance again, huh? To see him? - I do all the work here, and this is what I get! - I am going to leave you if... - That's what you think! Whore! Whore. - Happy New Year, wankers! What's up? - Nothing much. - How are things on the mainland? - Fine. I fucked your mom for Christmas. I taught her good, didn't I? - What else is new? - Nothing. Merry Christmas. - Where is Fart? - Didn't he come on the earlier ferry? No. Death is always a big loss. There are as many realities as there are living creatures in this world. Every living creature is irreplaceable. Antoine de Saint Exupery has written... that when a person dies, a whole world is lost. In this case, it also applies to an animal. We bury Lumi here in the cow house, which was a significant part of his world. We symbolically bury our friend Petri whose memory will live with us. Bye, Fart. Machine. Get up. It's damned cold here. Let's go. OK. If you're not coming, I'm staying. He decided to do it some time ago. Why didn't he tell me? It's hard talk about something like that. - You think the butterfly project will work? - Why? I don't want to leave this place. I am scared. - Scared of what? - That the same thing will happen to me. Hey... This is the beginning. Afew weeks and they should be hatched. There will be over 50,000 of them. There must be longer black ones too. Boys, this is going to work. Right? - What are you staring at? - Nothing. - Can't you turn around? - No. - Lie down. - I certainly will not. I want you to. - Take your panties off. - No, I will not. - Take them off. - What is wrong with you? Five seconds and you can go. You said nothing about touching. - Five seconds have gone. - You like this. You only want this. Juhani. You want this really bad. - Juhani, stop. - Why? You like this. Juhani, stop. Juhani, stop. What have I done to you? You're a whore. Dinnertime. Don't you like the food? What have I done to you? Hatch. Why won't you hatch? Hatch, you bastards. You betrayed me. - Three more months and... - Stop. I just came to tell you... I want you to come with me. - You will have to get a divorce. - Don't be crazy. - You have yourwhole life ahead; you will forget me. - No, I won't. - I'll buy you a house with a garden. - I don't want a garden. Okay, but you'll have to come with me. I love you. - You don't love me. - Don't say that. I love you. - We'll get out ofhere together. - Stop that. Come here. This is the last time. Then it's over. Come to me. - We need to talk. I don't want to talk. What is going on here? Salmi. At this time of the day. And the principal's wife. Cover yourselves. Go away, Tyyne. This is none of yourbusiness. Tyyne, for the last time, go away. I will have to tell the principal. If someone asks, you haven't seen anything. Right? I will have to tell the principal. - What are we going to do now? - Calm down. We'll be alright. - You killed her. - I didn't kill her. I'm not going to jail. - This is all my fault. - Calm down. No one will know we were here. Irene. You know I love you. You haven't seen orheard anything. Do you understand? You were in bed the whole night. You haven't been outside. - Right? - Yeah. Good. Then I won't have to tell them what you did to the cat. - You think I'm stupid? - No. And what you did here. We have to protect each other. If one of us blabs, we're both for it. - You won't tell them even if they hit you, right? - Right. You wouldn't tell on someone who protects you, right? Good. We'll be alright. If someone asks, you have been in bed all night. You can say that you had a nightmare. Who is going to ask? Anybody. If anybody asks, we were sleeping. We have to stick together, or otherwise we'll be in trouble. You wouldn't tell on your own family, would you? Good. Go to yourroom now. Put dry pajamas on. And you, put a dressing gown on. Dad, where are you going? Sjoblom. Let's go inside before we catch cold. Johansson. Sauli! "When I woke up, both Johansson and Salmi were in the bedroom." "There were wet clothes on the floor." Hamalainen confirmed that you and Salmi are often absent from the bedroom. Do you understand that you and Salmi are the main suspects? Answer me! Look me in the eye when I am talking to you! Is that what happened? No, it was Mom. I tried to help. The eggs should have hatched a long time ago. The silkworm butterflies have to be fed. Otherwise they won't eat. We have to look after them because they are blind and can't fly. He got away! They will not survive alone. They are like children orbabies. They need people to take care of them. They need to be protected. Orthey will die. I was wrong. People make mistakes. Everyone makes their own. This is the end. Everything is gone. My work, the Island. If you can keep a secret, I miscalculated. To keep the worms alive, we should have had ten times the number of trees. But we have to keep on trying. That is how the impossible becomes possible. Keep that in mind, Juhani. As I have to give you this letter... I want to confess one thing I imagine your fatherhas written about. I want to be the first to tell you about it. I lied to your father. When your parents wanted to change the custody decision - I wrote a negative statement. I didn't think you should be allowed to go back to your parents. The Island was a better place for you. You are sick, but you will be healed. You will not be healed until you let go. As long as you hang onto your past, it will hang onto you. No matter what it says in that letter, remember- that you should not be too harsh on life, not on your own or the life of others. Afterall, life goes by one day at a time. You should not waste it on bittemess and self-deception. Defeated people can't get up in the moming. They will realize that everything is over. Throughout life. Fortunately there are other kind of people: Survivors. They cannot be defeated. Juhani, you are a survivor. You'll leam how to fly no matterwhat. You are sick, but you will be healed. Hi. Hi. Sorry.
