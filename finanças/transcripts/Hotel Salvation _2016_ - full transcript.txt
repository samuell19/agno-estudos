Daya! Daya! Come home, son! The village was empty. It's ok, Dad. But.. Mom kept calling for me. And.. - I've finally got peace. - And I kept walking. Dad.. I don't know where I was going. - But it was quiet there. - Dad.. You have told us about this dream a number of times. It's okay. But why do you bother? You looked after your mother really well. As we do for you, too, Father-in-law. If I remember correctly somebody kept calling you constantly. And you kept saying that it hasn't been done, yet. As if someone was. As if someone was waiting for it to happen. And is getting scared that if it doesn't happen then - they'll have to come back again tomorrow. - Dad. I'll have to go now. There's a lot of work to do. I, too, am leaving. Where? Tomorrow, the cow benefaction. - And the day after, Varanasi. - What? What are you saying? I think my time is near. And I think I am ready to die now. But I don't want to die here. Before anything happens to me. I want to go to Varanasi. Dad! Nobody is going anywhere. Come on... I'll prepare the supper. Alright then. I will go myself. I will go alone. Did you say anything? - Why would I say anything? - So, then? How would I know? It's always something or the other. Take some holy water in your hands. Make your resolution. Would you make some donations? Place it here. - Say, 'I'. - 'I.' - Say, 'I'. - 'I.' Tell your full name. Dayanand Kumar. - 'I'm donating.. - I'm donating..' 'A cow! - A cow.' Now everyone can pay their respects to the Holy cow and take it's blessings. - Take blessings.. - I have to take your leave now. Hold on.. Yes, tell me? - As per the stars.. - Yes. September would be the best month for Sunita's wedding. - Okay. - The weather would be pleasant. - Sunita, hurry up! - Just a minute! And all the planets are aligned perfectly. I'll take care of it once I'm back. Yes, but you must hurry - and let me know at the earliest. - Yes. You know how busy it gets during the wedding season. Yes, of course. Thank you so much. Make sure you decide soon. And let me know if you need anything else. Yes. For sure. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Sunita! - Coming, just a minute. - Always getting us late. - Sorry! - Come back soon. - Yes. Let's go. Sir, the boss has called for you. I'll be right back. Sir, should I wait or leave? No, please wait. - Sir, could you sign this? - Take a seat. - Did you check it? - Yes. - So, tell me one thing. - Yes, sir. - Is the Ganges holy because of Varanasi? - Is the Ganges holy because of Varanasi? Or is Varanasi holy because of the Ganges? I don't know, sir. Why? I was just thinking - if Ganges is the reason.. - Yes. Then it flows through the country. So, why go all the way to Varanasi? But sir, that's where you get salvation. You could achieve salvation anywhere. It's a matter of faith. Do you have faith? Anyway, why do you have to go? Sir, who else will go? What about your work? Sir, I will manage. Don't forget your targets. Absolutely. - Greetings! - Bless you. - Everything's good? - What.. Yes. - Greetings! - God bless you, dear.. You seem very busy these days. No, Aunt. It's just the usual routine. Here comes the cake! - Let's cut the cake. - Here you go. - Go on, cut it. - Cut it.. - Shouldn't we sing something? - That.. Let's clap, at least. Why aren't you clapping? Why the sad face? Did somebody beat you up? - Something like that. - Is it? - Look at him eyeing the cake. - Here have it. That's enough. Here.. I'm here. Give me some! Here, ma'am, have some more. Rajiv. - Give him some. He'll say something sweet for a change. - Here.. - That's fine. Aunt, why don't you talk some sense into him? Aunt, why don't you talk some sense into him? What's the point? He is so stubborn. You're right, but at least try once. That's all we can do. But he won't listen. You came.. - So glad you could come. - Yes.. Well.. You could have waited till Sunita's wedding. Forgive me for anything wrong I may have said or done. Okay? Don't cry.. Come. So, let's start from the beginning. Three shirts.. - Leave this one out. It's not so nice. - Leave this one out. It's not so nice. Why aren't you keeping more books? Here they are. Put a few more. Aren't these enough? They aren't enough! The taxi will be here by 7 a.m. tomorrow. We'll be done packing by then. Dad? If we could stay a few more days.. Why? There's a lot of work at the office right now. What do you have to do? I just have to sit in the car and go. Just find me a taxi and I'll go. You can at least manage that, right? Should I come? No, it's fine.. - Have you seen this? - What is it? It's your grandmother's. Wear it on your wedding day. Okay? I am going to wear it now. How does it look? - Will you come? - Where? Varanasi? Or.. Varanasi. To the riverside. Here you go. From now on, this TV is yours. This is exactly why I won't stop you. - How can he possibly know his time is up? - How can he possibly know his time is up? I don't know. Maybe it's one of those things you just know. Grandfather was in perfect shape but within 10 days of getting there, he passed away. What? - Died. - Oh. So, it'll take 10 days? How would I know? You just said.. I was talking about grandfather. How would I know about dad? So, how long will it take? I'm just asking. Why are you getting upset? So, think before you ask. When will he die.. What? You want me to strangle him? - Is that what I said? - Then what should I do? What else I can do? Are you hungry? No. You're asking me as if I have the death's list with me. Leave the ATM card before you go. This is just an excuse to go on a vacation. Hey.. Hello. Hello, sir.. Sir.. Hello, sir.. Sir.. Can't you drive a little faster? What are you doing? Take it easy.. Go slow. Don't send me up before we get there. 'Varanasi. 120.' The name of Ram is the truth.. Keep going. Dad, hold tight. Dad.. Hail Mother Ganges! 'Salvation Homestead. Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh.' Dad, please let's go back home. What are you saying? Come on.. No, please let's go back home. Come, let's go inside! Which way is the office? Mr. Mishra, nothing has changed here over the years. Even the wall clock is same. If I, too, change with time, then what else would be left? Age? - 76. - Yours? - No, his. So, then let him speak. 77. By the way what makes you think that your time has come? I keep having the same dream. Oh, dreams! Dream is the eye of your inner consciousness. Do you have tuberculosis? No. Do you eat meat? No, never. Now, look. Why do people come here? In search of salvation. It's all a matter of faith. What is salvation? Hey. Get out of here. As I was saying, what is salvation? The soul thinks that it's a wave. But suddenly, it's set free and realizes that it's not just a wave. It's the ocean. This is salvation. Didn't you get it? I wasn't lying to you earlier that everything is occupied here. It was occupied. But just today, a soul achieved salvation. Look. Death is a process. Are you sure, you are ready to start the process? Mr. Mishra, the process has already begun. Let's go. There are 14 rooms here. You must clean your own room. Satguru can also do it but you'll have to pay him extra. Your health is in your own hands. We don't have any medical facilities here. You must cook your own food. Consumption of meat is prohibited. Do you consume alcohol? - Do you? - No. Marijuana, hashish, opium? - No. - You must try it! You can ask someone in the back alley. Please don't pay any money to priests here. You have sinned all your life and in your dying moments you pay the priest to forgive your sins. - Doesn't work like that, does it? Come on. - Doesn't work like that, does it? Come on. This is the prayer room. Why are you guys mumbling? Sing loudly. Come on! We are lucky to be right on the banks of the river Ganges. If you ever need the holy Ganges water feel free to fetch it from the river or my office upstairs. There is a marriage hall and a dairy next door. The name is Salvation Homestead. But we don't let out rooms till you receive salvation. The room is available only for 15 days. Only for 15 days? And after that? After that it's your headache. If you die then good for you or else go back home. So that's good. We can take the train back. Is there a booking agent around here? Come. Come, inside. Please maintain silence here. All right? Come in. Come in. It's free.. Is there another room? There is. Step out and turn right then, take a left. A little ahead there is Apsara Lodge. You will find a room there. For Rs. 500 a day. This works fine. Is it okay? We know people who can help you with your funeral arrangements. I will let you know where to go. I am assuming you have donated a cow already? Yes. Alright then. Call me if you need anything. It's free. It's free. You'll be able to stay here? Why not? What's wrong with this place? Rajiv. Which way is east? Facing that way. I will be back. "Glory to Sita-Rama!" "Glory to Sita-Rama!" "Glory to Sita-Rama!" "Glory to Sita-Rama!" "The name of Rama is the only truth in this world." "The name of Rama is the only truth in this world." "The name of Rama is the only truth in this world." "Says Lord Hanuman." "Glory to Sita-Rama!" "Glory to Sita-Rama!" "The name of Rama is the only truth in this world." "The name of Rama is the only truth in this world." "Says Lord Hanuman." "Glory to Sita-Rama!" I'm sorry, I don't know these hymns so well... That's okay. You'll get to know them with time. This is Rajiv, my son. Meet Vimla. Pay your respects. Hello. Bless you. You must be as old as my son, Ravi. - Flying Saucer? - Sorry? - Do you watch it? - No. Then what do you watch? No, I don't watch TV. He does. You do? - You must be following Flying Saucer then? - Yes.. So, why don't you join us in the TV room then? - No.. So, why don't you join us in the TV room then? - No.. It's going to start soon. Please come. Dad what do we do about dinner? Dinner? I made plenty. Come with me. No.. - Dad we can manage, right? - Yes of course.. - Why can't you eat with me? - No! - So come! - Come. She's insisting, let's go. Will you have some pickle? Here you go.. Mice are a big problem around here. All this arrangement for just 15 days? It's been 18 years. 18 years? I came here with my husband. We used to think that we'll leave this world together. But he left me behind. But Mr. Mishra said that you could stay here for a maximum of 15 days? That is the rule. That indeed is the rule. These days, my name is Surabhi. What do you mean? Does the food taste fine? - The food is delicious.. - Okay.. It must be hard living all by yourself? At first, I didn't like it but now I have learnt to let go. So, it's all good. Now, I'm just waiting. The food is delicious. Thank you! People nowadays say thank you too often. Thankful for everything, it seems. - I am sorry. - And sorry, too. You both must be tired. - No.. - Yes. 'Sir, look up! Open your eyes, sir.' 'I am back.' He is so much fun. Please forgive me. I know that you would come back. Rajiv. - Rajiv. - Yes, Dad? Water.. I'll have to go and get it. What are you looking for? We were out of water, so.. It's there in my office, next to the table. Right. Mr. Mishra. There must be ghosts here, right? Ghosts? What's that? Ghosts, spirits, ghouls.. - The souls here reside within the body. - The souls here reside within the body. Once it leaves the body they are free from the circle of life and death. What business do they have here? Listen. Try relaxing a little. All right? The name of Ram is the truth.. Sir, how can I come for a day? It'll take me a day to just come and go. Let me to talk to the client directly. - Rajiv! - Don't you worry. - Rajiv! - Don't you worry. - Let me worry about the targets. - Rajiv.. Hold on a minute, sir. Yes, Dad? Heat some milk for me. I'll have to go and fetch it. You know that I need milk every morning. Sir, please hold the line. Can't you do without it today? Fine, I'll get it myself. Sir, I will call you later. I'll go get it. Why couldn't you get it in the morning? Excuse me. Can I get some milk? Come before 7 a.m. I only need a little. Come back in the evening then. Just a little. Come in the evening. I'm there.. Just hear me out.. It's like you're planting a mango tree. And your sons and grandsons will reap the fruits eventually. That's all. - Sir, do you understand? - Rajiv? - Dad.. - You call this food? Sir, just listen to me.. You are like my family. - The moment I come back.. - Rajiv! - Rajiv this is tasteless. - I'm on the phone, Dad! You're on the phone all the time. Even when we eat! So, what's the matter? Eat it! Sir, hold on a minute. Please eat. If you want to feed me food like this I'll make it myself. I won't eat this. You call this food? - You have it! - Sir, let me call you back. - 'Where did you leave us and go, Amit Mishra?' - 'Where did you leave us and go, Amit Mishra?' 'You left us on 3rd March.' 'You could have stayed back for a few days.' 'On 13th, you should've eaten your grandson's birthday cake and left.' 'Your grandson keeps calling you and saying' 'Grandpa, come back.' 'Otherwise I won't cut the cake.' What kind of language is this? If he was my student, I would have failed him. This is how they write these days. The newspaper guys have pre-made templates. They just change the name and print it. They have ruined the language. - I will write my own obituary. - Write mine, as well. Dad, come on, it's time for your medicines. Tell me.. - I don't want any medicines! - So, you have met the host? - Why are you sitting out in the sun? - I'll come later. Take my advice, get your obituary written. - Why? - Because he is doing it for free! Lie down now. I am going out to get some food. Get some fruits. What? I think I'll follow the hermit's diet from now on. Millionaires eat fruits. Not hermits. I wasn't lying to you earlier that everything is occupied here. It was occupied. But just today, a soul achieved salvation. Death is a process. Are you sure, you are ready to start the process? Alright then. I will need your thumbprint here. Satguru! - Yes! - Come over here. Put them up in room number 12. Let's go. Thank you so much. Don't thank him just yet. It'll take a while. Why? Why will it take a while? Don't worry. He'll go soon. Mr. Mishra, how do you know who will die and when? I don't know. But I can sense it. Really? But your records tell otherwise. Listen, don't mistake my generosity for foolishness. Then why don't you tell me about my dad? - That, I can't do. - Why not? - If I tell you.. - Yes. My powers will be snatched from me. Who said so? - I just know. - Why don't you tell me? No! Absolutely not! I said no! He doesn't know anything. Keeps talking rubbish. He doesn't know anything. Keeps talking rubbish. The name of Rama is the truth.. The name of Rama is the truth.. The name of Rama is the truth.. He was a good man. It's been 18 years since I came here. Yes. You told me. I forget a lot. At this age, even I tend to forget. Rajiv gets so annoyed with me. Why do you keep repeating the same things again and again.. My son, Ravi, works a lot, too. He only calls me while he eats. I keep trying to tell him not to talk while eating. Then he says, 'Mom, when shall I call you then?' - This is how it is now. - This is how it is now. Rajiv is no different. Holding the phone in one hand and the spoon in the other. It really bothers me. - Come on now. - I am a little scared of water. Come on, we've reached already. Come on. Here, give me your hand. Here, mister. - Please, let me pay for this. - Doesn't matter at all. Come.. Why did you stop writing? All those stories you used to write? - Poems. - Poems. Oh, yes. I remember one about the old woman sitting on the moon. You still remember that? Of course. I even shared it with my colleagues. Your cane made me leave all of that. My cane? It didn't matter who did what in the whole class. It was always the teacher's son who was at fault. I only wanted the best for you all. And you were no different for me than the others. I know. It's very easy to blame others for your failures. - I am doing just fine. - I am doing just fine. But you please continue writing the obituaries. I'll get the doctor. Listen.. Don't get the doctor. We need to call a doctor. No. Get me holy water. - Holy water? - Yes. - Dad? - Dad? Time has come. Get me holy water. Start preparing. Yes, tell me. Will you eat anything? I think both of you should come soon. Yes. As soon as you can. Hold on. Mr. Mishra. Wait. You had mentioned something about funeral arrangements. The name of Rama is the truth. I have got the best quality wood for you. - What.. - How does it matter? You are very fortunate. Your son is here with you. That is true.. It's been said that when an elephant's time is near he leaves everyone and goes to die alone. Enough now. Shall we begin? "The tattered cover of life.." "The tattered cover of life.." "All the bonds would be left behind.." "The tattered cover of life.." What is he saying? He's requesting you to sing in tune please. Okay.. "The tattered cover of life.." Dad.. Yes, Dad? Water. Water. Have some water, Dad. - Rajiv. - Yes, Dad. You used to write such innocent poetry. I never let you bloom. I never let you bloom. What are you saying, Dad? Calm down. Calm down, Dad.. - Calm down. - Forgive me, my son. I should be apologising. Please forgive me, son. You've been such a good son. And I've been a terrible father. No, please don't say that. Forgive me, son. Quiet now.. Relax now. Calm down.. How are you feeling now? How are you feeling? Fit. Rajiv. Yes, Dad? Flying saucer. 'Leave from here and never return.' 'We treated you as our own and you betrayed us!' 'Don't do this. Don't say like this..' 'Silence!' 'Sir, you want me to leave from here, right? I'll do that.' - How much more is left Mr. Daya? - How much more is left Mr. Daya? 10 more minutes. You know, his elder brother ran away, so.. Naughty girl. You tricked me? You didn't recognise my voice? Gulabi makes really good tea. - Hey! - Ask her to make it then. You have never said anything about my tea. But when have I ever said that you make bad tea? You have never praised it either. But why do I need to say it? Here. Now it feels like home. It's been 12 days. I heard that they let you stay here for more than 15 days. Come back home. And leave him behind? How long will you stay here? He seems fine now. Are you disappointed? Has he started dreaming again? I haven't asked. Let's take him back with us, too. We'll bring him back here if he starts dreaming again. Is it? - As if he will listen to me. - As if he will listen to me. Why would we be here then? Who wouldn't fall sick here? Exactly. It's a circus back at home. Mom kept yelling at me. 'Sunita, did you take the forms or not?' Now fill it quickly. That's exactly what I am doing. You can't die until you announce it by filling a form. It's amazing. I always knew, you were not going to die. You fell so sick. Everybody thought that your time had come. But you weren't ready, yet. What? I am saying that you were not ready to go. Let's go home, Grandpa. Are you sure? Then your room will be gone. I'm used to my roommate. I don't like having the room to myself. You will be married soon. You will be married soon. How many whistles have been there? Four. And chilli? You have added it now or will you add it later? Added it right in the beginning itself. Very little coriander, I see. You have to chafe it to get the flavour. Is the food ready? Yes! What about your simple diet? If you started cooking well, then why would he return home? Father-in-law. What should we do with your scooter? Give it to her. She'll ride it. She'll ride the scooter? She rides. She rides the scooter? Since when? - Grandpa taught me. - What? Grandpa taught me. She rides well! Did you inform Vimla? About what? Just.. About going shopping tomorrow. This is quite nice.. It would be a great gift. Yes. - And this we can take for her sister-in-law. You decide please. I don't have a problem with that. Dad! Sunita! Take a look at the dresses. Dad.. Is he going to make us shop here for the wedding, too? Sunita, look at this. I think, this one will be perfect for your sister-in-law. Why do you want to get high right now? Mr. Mishra told me that this is.. Here, have it. - It's one of the famous delicacy of Varanasi. What if father gets to know about this? Then the both of us will attain salvation. Go on, drink up. Look out there! The prayer ceremonies are happening over there. You are just laughing for no reason. That's what we are looking at! She doesn't listen to anybody anymore. No need to speak to her. No, please get back there and sit. Don't be silly, sit down. Father-in-law, please sit down. - Come on stand up. - Why are you acting so childish? Sunita! They will fall down. Hail the Mother Ganges! Hail the Mother Ganges! You always have a problem with something or the other. - Greetings, Mr. Mishra. - Greetings. This is last week's rent. It's been 15 days now. We'll vacate tomorrow. You don't have to. Sorry? See, he will leave when the time comes. He came with his own free will. He himself started the process of death. Mr. Mishra, it will get really difficult for me. Here take your 900 bucks. What about the remaining Rs. 100? What about the days you disappeared? You have my mobile number, don't you? Yes, of course. So, we will be in touch then. Do one thing, give me a name. Sorry? Whose name? Any name? Anything would do. - Natwarlal. - Natwarlal. For the next 15 days from now your father's name will be Mr. Natwarlal in the registers. - But Mr. Mishra.. - I said I won't ask him to leave. You must study hard. I will come back after the exams. Always follow your heart. Bless you. - Father-in-law. - Bless you. Why don't you come home? You'll get used to it gradually. Dad, I'll be right back. Stay here. Breathe in from one side and exhale from the other. Yes. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. It helps in reducing stress. When it's my time to go, send me off with a celebration. You or Sunita? It's a nice family. Sunita likes the groom? Why? No, just.. Has she told you that she doesn't like him? No, she didn't say anything but I have a feeling that she doesn't like him that much. Perhaps, she is doing it because of you. Is that what she said? She didn't say a thing. But not everything needs to be said. Now, what's the solution for this? I think she is scared of you. That's why she doesn't say anything. Scared of me? Why? I have never raised a hand on her. Is fear only physical? Please don't put these ideas in her head. You think I am doing this? Did you ever think about me this much? And how do you know that? Did you just magically grow up? Let it be. Can I be honest? Go on. For a moment I thought that we will lose you. Even felt a little jealous. Jealous? Yes, I thought I have been waiting here for so many years and you have just arrived here. I suppose it means maybe I'd have been luckier then. You can't just die by trying. After my husband's death, there was no one I should return to. I tried a lot. I would starve myself for days. But nothing happened. And then I understood. It doesn't matter what you do or don't do. It doesn't matter what you do or don't do. Death comes on its own will. Do you want to eat here? Is everything alright? A client got away. It's not a big deal. You'll get another one. You need some fresh air. - Come. - There's a lot of work to be done. Come. It's so peaceful out here. Isn't it? Dad tell me something. What made you think your time has come? Just.. I felt like. I was ready to die. Why? Did we not take good care of you? - No, it's not that. - Then? It's just that.. I am tired of this world. Everything feels like such an effort. I am fed up now. If you had the chance to be reborn into this family, would you? No. Why would I want to come back as a man? What does that mean? I am going to be reborn as a lion. My mother used to call me her lion cub. I'll be a lion. Or, maybe a kangaroo. Why? - They have those amazing pockets! You can keep anything in it! Spectacles, pen, children. Anything. I'll be a kangaroo. Everything inside the pocket. But then you'll have to be born in Australia. So, what? At least I'll have a pocket. - That's it? - Enough. It's good? - Have some. - Yes. Tastes fine. It's very tasty. Lata. What? One minute. Calm down! Talk slowly. Slowly. Listen to me.. But how? I want to speak to her right now. What do you mean you won't get married? Tell me? Hello? - Yes, Dad. - She has taken up a job. Hello? - Yes, Dad. - She has taken up a job. What? - A job.. She has taken up a job. - Has she lost her mind? Suddenly? - Not suddenly, Dad. - So? - Leave it, what is going wrong with it? - Signal is weak. You said you liked him. Why did you agree in the first place? - What? - Why did you agree back then? He is asking you. - Is there someone else? - No.. - Hello.. - Hello.. Why can't we see him properly? The invites have been printed already. He.. The invites have been printed already! Hello? Hello! - I.. Hello.. I'll earn and return it to you. Sorry.. - What will you do? Hello? - I'll return the money.. - What will you return? - She's saying she'll return the money. What? You'll return the money? We'd be a laughing stock in the whole town. Nothing will happen. Dad it doesn't matter to anyone. - It matters to me. - Please don't yell. Let it be. It doesn't matter to you, it matters to us. Hello! - Hello! - Hello? - Hello! - Listen, you please keep calm. - Hello.. She's brought shame to the whole family. You guys are doing a great job! How much? - Should we install a satellite for you? - How much? It's Rs. 50. Thank you. "Glory to Sita-Ram." "Glory to Sita-Ram." "Glory to Sita-Ram." "Glory to Sita-Ram." Rajiv? Rajiv? Rajiv! Rajiv! Sir, something came up so I couldn't return. I'll come, sir, very soon I'll return. Sir, please don't stress.. Sir, why are you shouting? Sir? If you leave now, you will never be able to forgive yourself. Don't worry. Your father will be free soon. Now what will the poor boy do? Poor boy? Why? His daughter will live her life on his terms or on her own? Poor! It's not like that! Try to talk to him once. Try to talk to him once. Nicely. I don't speak nicely, is it? He is stubborn. Okay. Do what you feel is right. Come on. Go to sleep now. Sir.. Sir, wake up. Sir, I need the receipt. - Yes. Sir, pen.. - What happened? - Ms. Vimla attained salvation. "The day your body is laid in soil." "Adorned in bright colours." "Adorned in bright colours." "Is the day the bird escapes the cage." "And flies to freedom." "Your kin won't be able to help." "The villagers will be left behind standing helpless." "The villagers will be left behind standing helpless." "Brothers will have their hands tied." "The brothers will have their hands tied." Don't be sad. You should be happy. Your mother has achieved salvation in Varanasi. "Your wealth and possessions, nothing will follow you." "The villagers will be left behind standing helpless." "The villagers will be left behind standing helpless." "The villagers will be left behind standing helpless." "Brothers will have their hands tied." "Brothers will have their hands tied." "The name of Rama is the truth." 'Vimla.' 'Vimla was quiet like the sea.' 'Calm on the surface.' 'Even if a storm simmers beneath.' 'After she left' 'I went to the market and bought some sweets.' 'And I told the confectioner' 'to give me two glasses of Lassi.' 'Laced with marijuana.' 'One for me' 'and one for Vimla.' 'When I drank both the glasses' 'and went to the river side.' 'I saw' 'that Vimla was flying away.' 'Soaring on top of the Ganges.' 'I asked myself.' 'Am I high?' 'Or is that really you, Vimla?' 'She said' 'Don't call me, Vimla.' 'That was my name' 'when I was trapped like you.' 'Swaying between life and death.' 'Now I am a spirit.' - 'Free.' - 'Free.' 'A free spirit.' 'I have no name.' 'Vimla hopes' 'that one day someone' 'will plant a tamarind plant in her memory.' 'A tamarind..' 'A tamarind plant.' Dad? It's time for you to go, Rajiv. Where? Where should I go, Dad? After so many years you have started to feel like my own. You should leave now. No, Dad. I am not going anywhere. I'll be here with you. I won't go. - Go back now. - Why don't you come with me, Dad?
