(MultiCom Jingle) (gentle upbeat music) - [Janice] I think he's smart, I think he's good for you. I don't understand, I just don't understand. - [Sharon] Well Mom, you're just going to have to deal with it. - [Janice] Sharon I like Trevor. - [Sharon] Well I like Trevor too Mom, but we're still breaking up. - [Janice] Why? - I don't know. - You two were great together. Don't you wanna pack this sweater? - No. - Your dad thought he was terrific, so do I. - That's the problem Mom. You always do. - What does that mean? - I just mean that you don't need to be in the middle of my love life, okay? - But Sharon, your dad and I think that it's very-- - What is this with dad and I, dad and I? Dad is never even here Mom. - We care about you. - Yeah well maybe you care too much. - Look I just thought Trevor was the kind of guy who was really-- - Appropriate? Good family. Politically correct. - That's not fair. - Yeah well listen Mom, if you like Trevor so much why don't you go out with him? I happen to know he's available. - Oh Sharon come on. - Mom, what is it they say? Get a life? I can't believe I have exams all next week. - Guess I'm just a concerned neurotic mom. - Well you do it very well. - Thank you. - I love you anyway. - Drive carefully. - I will. - Oh Sharon? - [Sharon] Yeah? - You coming home next weekend? - I'll call you. - [Ross] And he was stalled an extra day in Geneva so I'm stuck in Munich, and there is no way that I can get home for your birthday. I'm so sorry honey. I know how much this meant to you. But when I get back, no, just a minute honey. I told you not to fax that until I've seen them. - [Woman] I'm sorry sir. - [Ross] Anyway when I get back we'll do something special. I love you and I miss you. Honey, I am really sorry. (answering machine beeps) (violin music) - Hi Wendy. - Janice, what do you think? - It's a great turnout. - Yeah. - You look terrific. Have you seen Liz? - No, but when I see her I'll tell her you're here. Are you leading the tour? - [Janice] No. - First tour is ready to start, but only for those with the blue name tags. Blue name tags only please. Now in designing the Civic Center, the architects were striving for something more expressive than the egalitarian intentions of so many public buildings in recent years, and the Great Hall is a fine example. You will note, note the sweeping use of the Verde Alpi Marble. The scintillating design of the black polished granite which is all integrated with elegant splashes of terrazzo. This way please. I think you will all agree that the council chamber is the most original. The room is crowned by a dome and a hand-painted sky, lighted by day with the ring celestial windows around the cylinder and by night with artificial lighting and fiber optic stars. - I really think she should have her own talk show. - You're on the wrong tour you know. Red tag, this is blue. - Don't tell anybody. I'm not sure she knows what she's talking about. This is postmodern. - You're an architect? - Sometimes. The dome is beautiful. - Surrounding the square, which share a large, curved outer service made in-- - Janice, hi. - Hi. - What'd I miss? I got lost. - Scintillating polished granite. Hi, I'm Guy Elliman. - Oh. - Hi. - Sorry. Liz Flynn. - Your tour's just started. - [Janice] You're not coming? - I'm on the red tag tour. It's been a pleasure. I'll see you later. - [Tour Guide] With a very public quality. - Who is he? - I have no idea. - Having a quality in the tradition of public works. It is hoped. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Guy] Janice, it's Guy Elliman, from the opening. - Hi, how did you get my number? - Kind of a sneak. - [Janice] Something tells me I should hang up. - No, please don't. I was thinking we could have lunch. - Oh I can't really. - [Guy] How about tomorrow? - Tomorrow? No I can't tomorrow. - Thursday? - I don't think so. - Okay. How about Friday? - I met a very interesting man. His name is Guy, I'm having lunch with him. He's interested in architecture too. It's just lunch. - Is he attractive? - Attractive? I guess so. So... What were we talking about? - Ross. - Oh yes Ross called. He's canceled coming home for my birthday. - You were really counting on that. - Yes I was. - Which makes you feel? - Disappointed. Angry. It was something to look forward to. - Do you think that makes you vulnerable to a date with this man? - A date? It's just lunch it's not a date. - Really? (upbeat music) - Hi. - Hi. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. - Let me take your coat. - I'm fine. - I thought you might get cold feet. - I did. Nearly canceled. - But you didn't. - I didn't. - You're here. - I'm here. - What are you drinking? - Mineral water. - [Guy] Good. I wanted to tell you that I love the house that you live in. - How do you know it? - I read about it. The Tudor was designed by Louis Moore. - I'm impressed. So you're a sometimes architect? - Sometimes. - And other times? - I'm an architect of the face. Of the eyes, smile. I'm a doctor, I'm a plastic surgeon. And you're very beautiful. - So tell me Doctor, why didn't you become an architect? - That's a very good question. I love architecture. I'm building my own house. It's still in the planning stages, and it's going to stay in the planning stages until I find the right person to live in it with me. - I see. - The plans, the models, sketches, just sitting there on my dining room table. It's around the corner. 10th floor. (phone ringing) - [Guy] Yes? - [Linda] Oh good you're there. You know I've been calling you all morning. I came by earlier and my key wouldn't work. - I've had the locks changed. - [Linda] Why? Why'd you do that? - I've met someone else and I'm in love with her. - [Linda] Very funny Guy. - I don't mean to hurt you Linda, but this is over. - [Linda] You have got to be kidding. You're breaking up with me over the phone? - No. - I'm coming there and you're gonna talk to me. - No I can't. - [Linda] Yes you can. I'm coming over right now. I can't believe this! - I've had your things sent to your apartment. - [Linda] You sent my things to my apartment? You really think you can do this without telling me to my face? What kind of person are you anyway? - I'm sorry. - I can't believe you're trying to-- (phone beeps) - [Janice] I found out who that great looking man at the opening was. - [Liz] Who? - Doctor Guy Elliman. He's a plastic surgeon. He's the one who did Wendy's lift. - Wendy had her face done? - Oh he took major mileage off her face. - He was very interested in you. - He was not. - I'd go out with him in a second. - You're divorced, I'm married. - Oh right. You're a business widow. Get a life. - I wish everyone would stop telling me that. I have a life. A very comfortable life thank you. - While Ross is partying in Europe. - He's working in Berlin. - If I had a man like Dr. Elliman after me, I'd go to bed with him just to get a free face lift. (laughing) (phone ringing) - [Ross] Please leave a message after the tone. (answering machine beeps) - [Guy] Hello, it's me Guy. I wanted to get your opinion of the plans for the house. I was hoping you'd stop by tomorrow afternoon. Maybe around 3:00, the address is 1146 Riverside Drive. That's 1146 Riverside Drive. I really hope to see you there. I hope you're keeping warm. It's cold outside. Yes? - Hi, it's Janice Mitchell. - Come up to the 10th floor. (door buzzing) Welcome. You're going to have to come out of the elevator to get some champagne. - I'm sorry, I didn't expect to see you so soon. - To see me so soon. Yes well I didn't want you to get lost. I'll be taking your coat this time. (sensual music) - Oh wow, I like it. - Thanks. I'm glad you came. - What a view. - You should see it at night. - Oh the plans for your house. - Yes, you doubted me? I was genuine. Let me make love to you. Here. Now. - I can't. (sensual music) - [Guy] This is your first affair isn't it? - Does it show that much? I bet you've had lots of women. - No. You'd be surprised how few. Honest. I couldn't be more honest with you. - Who was your first? (Guy chuckling) - My mother's best friend when I was 17. - Did your mother know? - Well if she did she never brought it up, but she was away. Always away. On business. When she left my father she dumped me with my grandmother and the housekeeper, and I lived with them until I was sent away to boarding school. - Must've been very lonely. - My mother was a very glamorous woman. Very beautiful. Like you. I wanna be with you for a long time. (gentle downbeat music) - [Janice] Guy makes me feel so young, and so wanted. I feel alive again. - [Therapist] Yes. - [Janice] It's like waking from a long sleep. I feel connected to something. - [Therapist] And Ross? - [Janice] Ross? - [Therapist] Yes. Where's Ross in all this? - [Janice] I don't know. I don't know Doctor, in Munich, Hamburg. You tell me. I imagined Guy as a very slow lover, and he is. Guy's got beautiful hands. Long fingers. Which turned out to be a very good omen. I know I should be feeling guilty about this. - [Therapist] Do you? - [Janice] No, I don't think so. I feel like I deserve it. - I have a long weekend coming up at the end of the month. I have a place in Aspen. I'd like to take you skiing for your birthday. (gentle downbeat music) - [Janice] I'll definitely spend the weekend with him. - [Driver] Is this everything Mr. Mitchell? - [Ross] Yeah I think so. Hi Janice. Anything in the backseat? - [Driver] Nope I got it all. - [Ross] Thanks. Hey honey. Are you surprised? - Very, when did you get in? - This morning. - Ross, why didn't you let me know? - 'Cause I wanted to surprise you. I tried calling you last night, where were you. - I spent the night in the city with Liz. - Well, you got me for a whole week. - [Janice] Oh. - I missed you. - [Janice] Me too. - You look great. - [Janice] Thanks. - It's been a hell of a month getting the Germans and the Brits to agree on anything. It looks like they're gonna sign. Merger's just around the corner. - It's stunning Ross. - How about I take you to the club for your birthday? - I'd like that. The necklace is beautiful. Thank you. - You're welcome. I tell you, it is great to be home. (phone ringing) - Ross, don't pick it up. - It could be the office. - I know but please, let's just you and me. - Honey. Hello? Yes, yeah. Well we'll have to do it over the phone. I'm looking at the licensing agreements right now. Yes. Well they're not gonna back down. (Ross murmuring) We dispute it. - [Liz] Hello? Liz, Janice. Don't ask any questions, but if it ever comes up I spent last night at your house. - [Liz] Are you having an affair? - I gotta go. - No, we can't afford it. That's what they agreed to, that's what they're gonna stick to. - Yeah, Janice, please. I know, I understand. It's not your fault, all right? Aspen will always be there. We'll keep the champagne on ice. I love you, and happy birthday. - [Man] Good evening Mr. Mitchell. (elegant music) - [Woman] Thank you. - Club is quiet tonight. - Yes, a quiet evening. - [Guests] Surprise! (applauding) - I'm speechless. - Happy birthday love. All right where's the champagne? - [Man] Right here. - Okay. This is for the birthday. Whoa! (guests cheering and applauding) - Thank you Janet. - We need to talk. - Did you know he was coming home? - Uh huh. - And you didn't tell me? - I didn't know there was a reason to. What's up? - Later. (gentle music) - You were really surprised, I could see it on your face. You know you look beautiful. - The necklace, the party it's all terrific Ross but-- - Everybody showed up just for you. - It's all wonderful Ross. - Honey, you okay? You seem a little tense. - This is so unexpected. - That's why they call it a surprise party. - Very nice party. - Hey Bob. - How you doing Ross? Many happy returns for the day. You look lovely. You better be careful, I've been working on my serve. - What are you doing Saturday morning? - Well I'm whipping your butt at the club, that's what I'm doing. There's Mike and Andy, listen why don't we make it doubles on Saturday? - Honey could you excuse me? (gentle piano music) (ominous music) - Fun evening huh Janice? - Uh huh. - [Ross] Wasn't it great that Barbara and Ron were able to make it? - Uh huh. - Didn't enjoy it? - No, I did. We have to talk. - Okay. - When you came home today, I wanted you to make love to me the minute you walked in. On the couch, on the floor, in the shower. That sounds crazy I know, but you, make me feel like a wife. - Well I should hope so. - No. More like someone you know too well. There's something missing Ross. Something lost. No please, I need more from you. I want you to want me as a woman, as a lover. - I do. - No, you take me for granted. - No I don't, Janice I don't. You know all over the world I see other men going out with all kinds of women behind their wives' backs, and it never appealed to me. I think about you all the time. I need you. - For what Ross? - Just to be there to come home to. - I need to be more than that. We need to be more than that. - But we are, honey we are. We have 21 years of history together. We have a beautiful daughter, we have a life. - No. You have your work. Sharon is gone. And I sit in this empty house and I don't know what to do with the rest of my life. - God honey. - I'm totally alone. - I never knew you felt like this. - I know, and that's the problem. - What can I do? - I don't know. But I think being together in the same room for a change and talking is a good start. - I would be so lost without you. I love you so much. (gentle music) - And then we made love. In a way that I don't think we ever had. It's as if we unlocked some secret door or something. I don't think Ross and I have ever been as connected as this. - That's good. I'm happy for you. - Yes, but I still have to find out where I'm going. I've depended on Ross and Sharon to define me for so long. - [Therapist] It'll come. You're looking in the right places. - I guess. But now I feel so guilty. - What about? - About Guy. I got so involved with him. Now I don't know how to get out of it. - Do you want to get out of it? - I think so. Yes. - [Guy] I was thinking that maybe we could turn our skiing weekend thing into a whole week, hmm? - [Janice] Uh huh. I just don't wanna be left high and dry again. - Look Guy, I don't wanna disappoint you. - What do you mean? - Guy. This has been really wonderful. Our time together. It's like you've given me a gift. - So say thank you. - I am. But I'm also saying we have to stop. - Stop what? - Seeing each other. - Why? - It has nothing to do with you. - Oh no I think it does. Doesn't it? Explain this to me 'cause I don't understand. - I never should have started this with you. - I see. Janice this is the big kiss off huh? - Please Guy. - What do you want from me after everything that you've said? - Said, what did I say? - What we had together was something special, you said that. - Yes, but we both said a lot of things. - You said that you loved me. You said you were going to leave him. You said that you were going to divorce Ross. - Oh Guy I never said that. You know that's not true. - Are you denying it? - You know that's not true. (gentle downbeat music) - You are so fickle. You used me. Your husband comes home, he makes love to you all cozy warm and I'm out of the picture. - That's not-- - Yes, that is the story. Isn't it? He's the good husband and I'm the bad guy, right? Right. Well, you've made your point. There's no reason to go on. I assume you've told your husband about us. I accepted everything that you've said. About our being together, about everything. - I never set out to hurt you. I'm truly sorry. - [Guy] Are you? - Yes I am. This just has to end. (downbeat music) (phone ringing) - Hello? Hello? Someone keeps hanging up. - Maybe we should get the number changed. - Don't leave me. - I'm just going to put on the coffee. I'll be right back. (frightening music) - I missed you so much. - This is insane, how did you get in? - I told you I'm sneak. - My god, Ross is upstairs. - Don't you find it exciting? - How long have you been here? - I had to see you. - Guy you've gotta go. You've got to go now. Now. - I can't wait to make love to you again. - [Ross] Hey you. - [Janice] Hi. - Breakfast in bed? I'll make my world famous waffles. (gentle downbeat music) - I got your message on the concert, sounds terrific. Last night was, well... I'm really excited about the weekend. I can't wait to be with you. I can't wait to be with you. - [Recording] The number you have reached is not in service. The number you have reached is not in service at this time and there is no new number. (slamming cabinet door) - I love you. I'll be back in less than a week, I promise. If I'm not, you can burn my passport. (laughing) - I love you. - I'll call you. - Emmett Saunders Hall opened in May, 1987. It cost $60 million dollars and seats 2,040. It was designed by Thomas Knight, and has received numerous architectural awards. As you look up, notice the Oculus, our central chandelier, and the cylinders radiating from it, those cylinders are active acoustical banners. They can be raised or lowered to lengthen or shorten the reverberation time. And one final note, no pun intended, the organ. The Emmett Saunders memorial organ has 5,026 pipes, two consoles and stave trumpets. Please, come right this way. And watch yourselves on the stairs. Hi Vera. - [Vera] Hi Mrs. Mitchell. - No that concert will be next week. This is the end of your tour. You can go down those stairs and down the second set of stairs and that will take you out. Thank you very much for coming today. I have some information on the hall if anyone would like to read about it. - Thank you. - Here you are. I've really enjoyed showing you around. - Thank you very much. - You're very welcome. Oh thank you, thank you. (applauding) - May I? - Oh, you would like this. - Thanks. - That's your last tour right? - [Janice] Yes. - I'm just gonna lock up the auditorium. I'll see ya downstairs. - Thanks. - [Guy] I've missed you. - You scared me. What are you doing here? - I caught your act. You're really good. - [Janice] I don't understand. - I wanna talk to you. I tried to call you but you changed your number and it's unlisted. - I'll get my bag, we can have a drink. - No, no I'd rather talk here. Janice. I've been thinking a lot about us, and I love you. - Guy please. - I love you so much. - Guy please don't do this. - I wanna be with you and I know that you love me too. I know that. - No! - Janice. Please listen. Janice please! Janice please. - Herb! (suspenseful music) - Janice please. - You're scaring me, stop. - I just wanna talk. I wanna talk. - No, leave me alone. - Janice. - [Janice] Herb! - [Guy] Janice! - Herb! Vera! Please don't do this to me. - Why won't you listen? Why? (muffled shouts) (suspenseful music) - [Janice] Help me! Help! - Don't you love it? - Stop! Stop! (Janice whimpering) - If you need anything call me. I'm here for you. - Thank you. - Call me. - I will. I talked to Dad. He's so worried about you Mom. - Is he coming? - Yeah, he'll be here tonight. And he said to give you lots of hugs and kisses. So. - Mrs. Mitchell. - Mom, this is Detective Ryan from the police. She wants to ask you about what happened, but if you don't want to talk to her... - No it's okay. Raise up my bed. - Okay. - Janice I know this is a very difficult time for you, but if I could just ask you a few questions. The security guard never got a good look at the man who did this to you. Can you tell me what he looked like. - He was about 5'10" or 11. - White, Hispanic, black? - White. - And what color was his hair. - Black, and he had a beard. - [Detective Ryan] And how old would you say this man was? - Early 20s. (Sharon crying) - Okay. All right? Where is she? - She's that way. - Hi. - Hi. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I'm so sorry. - No. Don't you say that. - I feel so ashamed. - Don't say that, don't you blame yourself. Right? - Excuse me. Can you tell me where the cafeteria is? - Yes, it's down the hall to your right. - Doctor says you can go home tomorrow. We'll go up to the lake, you can rest. - Don't leave me. - Never, I promise. It's okay. It's okay. (gentle downbeat music) - [George] Ellen? Ellen! Look who's here. Hi. Now this is a surprise. - [Ross] George. - How was the trip? - Well it was fine until the ferry broke down. - Breaking down all winter, they should junk it. - [Ross] Really? - Lighthouse is coming along. - [George] They stopped working on it after the storm. - Give me a hand on this. - Didn't expect to see you. - Yeah sure. - Well we just wanted to get away. The Hobarts up? - [Ellen] No, they left after Christmas. - [Ross] What about Judge Shaw did he make it? - [George] Nope. - [Ross] Really? - Nope, nobody's up. You're stuck with us I guess. - [Ellen] Who'd wanna come to this godforsaken island in the winter anyway? (gentle downbeat music) - What? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know if you want you can talk with me about this, it might help. - No. I can't. - I feel like you're leaving me out. - I'm sorry. - I wish I could take away those feelings but all I can do is love you. - I know. (seagulls calling) - [Therapist] How are you? - [Janice] I'm exhausted. So tired. I can't sleep. - [Therapist] Why do you think? - [Janice] Whenever I look at Ross I wanna tell him everything. He's desperate to help me, but I can't let him. - [Therapist] I understand. - [Janice] He's been so incredible through this. So caring. Selfless. Should I tell him? - [Therapist] What do you think you'd gain? - [Janice] I wouldn't have to live with this guilt. - [Therapist] Are you prepared for Ross' reaction? - [Janice] No, I'm not. I'm still afraid Doctor, even here. - [Therapist] Of Guy? - [Janice] Yes. - [Therapist] Usually with men like him, after they've vented their anger they move on. You hurt him, he hurt you back. I suspect it's over. - Sharon called. - She did? - Yes. You were still taking your nap, I didn't wanna wake you. She's coming up for the weekend. - Great. - And she's bringing a friend. - A friend friend or a? - Boyfriend I think. She said that we would approve. - This looks wonderful. - Thank you. And Detective Ryan called too, she said that they still have no suspects. They're sending some more photos out for you to take a look at. (ominous music) (frightening music) (Janice screaming) - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - What happened? - I saw him - Who? - [Janice] I saw him. - You're okay. Okay, it's just George. - What is it George? - You've got raccoons in the garbage. It was making an awful mess. Can I do anything? - No. No I'm fine, fine you just scared me. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Ross. - Yeah? - I have something to tell you. - Okay. - I love you. - I know that. Now go to sleep. - I put all the groceries away. - Thank Ellen I'll have Ross give you a check. - Good, write it to me. He spends every nickel on that damn lottery. See ya later. - Buh-bye. Hi. - Hi. (ominous music) - Oh dear god. - You look wonderful. How are you? - How's it going hun? - Hi. - Yeah. Mom I want you to meet someone. This is Guy Elliman. - Mrs. Mitchell. Thanks for having me. - Call me Janice. How was your flight? - [Sharon] Bumpy. - Oh, this is terrific. Built in the 20s I bet, huh? - That's a good guess. You know your architecture, let me give you a hand. - Oh thank you very much. - You and Janice will have a lot in common. Would you like a drink? Who'd like a drink? I'm fine, Guy? - Scotch would be terrific, thanks. - Janice? - Nothing, thanks. So, where did you two meet? - At the hospital, when you were there Mom. Isn't that bizarre. Guy's a plastic surgeon. - Ah. - [Ross] Are you sure you don't wanna go? - I'm sure. - So, what do you think of Guy? - I think he's a little old. - I think I like that. Show's Sharon's maturing. You okay? - My head hurts a little. - Might be nice to have a doctor in the family. - Did she say something to you? - No, I was just joking. I'll see you soon. - [Janice] Ross? - Yeah? - He can sleep in the back bedroom. - Sure. I'm sorry Janice isn't feeling well. - I told Guy what happened Dad. - I'm very sorry. - I was really worried about her but she's coming along. - If this is a bad time for a visit maybe I should go. - No, it's probably better for her to have people around. - Did they find the man that did it? - Nope. No leads. Nothing. - So they were gonna tear down the lighthouse and then Mom put together this preservation campaign. So now they're restoring it. - It's a very unique lighthouse. How old is it Janice. - 1917. - You like hunting? We hunt rabbit up here in the winter and some pheasants. Sharon's a pretty good shot. - I don't like guns. My cousin was killed in a hunting accident. - That's awful. - Yeah, what happened? - He was shot by a friend. - [Ross] Well if you know what you're doing it can be very safe. - So Guy and I are gonna go to his place in Aspen next month. - Oh, really? Well we love Aspen don't we honey? - It's funny, you never mentioned Guy in any of your phone calls. - [Sharon] I didn't think it was a big deal. - Are you in love with him? - I don't know. - Are you sleeping together? - Mom. I can't believe you just asked me that. Look I think he's special and he thinks that I'm special okay? So let's just drop it. - I just don't want you to rush in to anything. - Mom, you had the caterer already picked out when it was Trevor. Why do you get so nuts about my boyfriends? I thought you'd like him. - Well I don't. - Can I help? - We've already finished. - I want you out. Now. Tonight. - I can't. Sharon and I are going for a walk tonight. - I protected you, why are you doing this? - Because I don't understand why you left me. It wasn't right Janice. - Ready? - Sharon it's cold and it's late. - Yeah well we'll keep each other warm. Goodnight Mom. - Goodnight Janice. There we go, now it's cooking. - Yeah. - I wanted to tell you I think your mom is great. And you dad is terrific. - Yeah I think they like you too. They've been checking you out. - Really? - Mm hmm. My mom's been asking a lot of questions. Like how we met, what you like. Have I slept with you. - No. What did you tell her? - Every dirty detail. (ominous downbeat music) - [Ross] M-A-L-L-I-T-E. - Mallite? That is not a word. - That's right. It is somebody who hangs out at the mall. It's a new word, mallite. - No, boo. He makes up his own words. Nope, take it off Mr. Mallite. Right now. - All right. F-A-I-R. Fair. - All right. Well at least that's a word. - [Ross] Your turn Doctor. - That's very good, I didn't see that. I think I'm just gonna add to that. I'm gonna add an A and an F. Affair. Also notice that's 28 extra points. - [Sharon] Oh very good! - I've taken the lead now too. - So smart. - [Ross] You're in the lead. - [Sharon] Okay. All right, let me see what, oh wait. Oh well look at this, this is smart. S-M-A-R-T. Smart. How do you like that? - [Ross] That just sums you right up doesn't it? - [Sharon] I know, Daddy it's your turn. - Honey, you tired? - Yeah, I'm gonna turn in. - Okay, I'll be up soon. - Night Mom. - Night Janice. - [Ross] Travel, T-R-A-V-E-L. - Very good. - E. - [Sharon] Very good. You're making words now Dad! - [Guy] Am I still in the lead? - [Sharon] You're still winning.
