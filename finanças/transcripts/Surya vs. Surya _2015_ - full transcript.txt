Ma'am.. If you give Surya carrot juice with a dash of pepper and turmeric in the evenings, it will do wonders for his health. Pepper and turmeric is not added in carrot juice. It is given with milk. If you want to experiment something try it on your son. - Okay. Don't try it on my son! - Okay! It is time for him to go to college. Did you serve him food? - Yes, I did. He must have left by now. Surya! You don't even come out in the sun. Why do you need a girlfriend? Forget all this and study well. Aruna did not come today. He asked me to drop you. Hey, get down. Get down.. Are you wondering why you weren't dropped at your college? From tomorrow, everyone from your college will look for you. You did not understand, isn't it? My boy! If a man has to exhibit his valour he should prove it against another man. This is the ideal spot! After all for a TV anchor how dare you attack my men? Zubair! Zen Zubair! People call me the tiger of old city. This will be your last night. Hey, put off the lights and show him how fearful darkness could be. Hey! He might die if you hit him so hard. Be gentle. Slowly. Switch on the lights. Stop it.. I don't get scared when its dark. In fact, I live in the dark. My name is Surya. I cannot see the sun. 'SURYA VS. SURYA' Hey, mind you! You are leaving the tiger of the old city Zen Zubair behind. - Go on, pal. We can't handle him, sir. - Go on. Go quickly.. You rascals, how dare you betray Zen Zubair? I stood by all of you, but you are betraying me now. If you dare to come back to eat my sweet Paan I'll break your legs and throw it in the burning stove. I swear on my mother, I'll slaughter you all. Sir, don't take this seriously. Forget everything and come to Zubair's Paan palace. I will make a special sweet Paan at free of cost. Come on. Start the auto and drop me at the college. Sir, that's an auto, not a boat. Sir, that's an auto, not a boat. That's a boat, the one going there. We call that a boat. So, is this an island? In that case, ask them to return. You hit them black and blue. Why would they come back? They will not return. You hit them so hard that they deserted me too. I'll give you a number, make a call. Battery is low. Further, there is no signal. I am sorry. Sir, there's phone network here. But it is fluctuating. Tell me the number quickly. 984845767. - 98484.. The number you are trying to reach is currently busy. To leave a voice message in your phone, press star.. - Try another number. - Okay. in your phone, press star.. - Try another number. - Okay. I think, 984854.. Quickly, sir. The battery is dying. 98484.. 57644. "Look at the abode of Lord Venkateswara.." God! Is it your dad? - No, he's my friend. Hello! Hello.. - Mr. Ersam. It's me, Surya. - Surya.. Your classmate. Surya.. I know why you did not come to the college today. - Do you? You don't have to worry. Aruna, you and I have finally passed this year. That's not the problem, Mr. Ersam. Please listen to me. I know what you are about to ask. You were going to ask for a party, right? Sure. We'll party tomorrow evening at Bangalore Iyengar bakery over a cookie, a cool drink and if that is not enough.. - Gosh! ...one cream filled bun too. - Hey, old man! Stop reading the menu. Stop reading the menu. First listen to what your friend has to say! Mr. Ersam, I am stuck in a problem. - What? Hello? - I'm stuck on an island at present.. I..I am stuck.. What happened? Battery died. Is there no other way to get out of this place? Nothing at all. Fish.. Fishermen will come at dawn! They can help us. Is there no other option? Yes, there is. If you can swim we can swim across to the other side. But, I cannot swim.. sir. This is highly impossible. Hey, have you gone mad? You will die, sir. Come back. Help.. Come back.. - How far am I? I can't do it. I knew you would return. Didn't I tell you that the fisherman will arrive at dawn? Can't you wait until then? Why did you do risk it, sir? The sun will rise before they get here. Once the sun is out, I will die. Did you just say you'll die? Take this. At such times, alcohol is a great stress buster. Thank you. - Don't mention it. Look. While I was following you, I happened to see your college. It did not look like a college though. It looked like a railway station. Are there colleges like these too? Now tell me. You said you'll die once the sun rises. Why is that so? What is your story? Hello, hero! This is a night college. You'll find woman of my age more than young girls here. Whether you wear a shirt or not no one will notice you. If you munch on all sorts of rubbish you will have bad breath. I am talking to you. Listen! Go straight to your class. Return to home once you are done. If you try to act smart, I will kill you. - Okay. Go. Your way of dressing is classy. However, your college looks pretty cheap. Why did you enroll in such a college? Hey! Do you really have to study here? You leave, Mom. - Hey, it's your fate. No one can alter another person's fate. Bye. H-Hi! Oh, my God! Don't stick papers.. Oh, my God! There's a strike! How much is this? - Rs. 80.. Hey, step aside. Please come, sir. Hey, sit there. Sit down, sir. Move. His name is Aruna Sai. I'd heard that auto drivers easily sweep young girls off their feet. Now, I kind of believe it. Why are you so fond of me? I am impressed with your driving skills, Aruna. He fell in love easily but as precondition to wedding, he had to complete his graduation. So, he landed here. I am Aruna Sai, an auto driver. I am Surya, a student. Oh! You are from Telugu medium is it? Her English is weak. Hello, three people can fit in a bench. His parents gave him that name. 'Erisami Grocery, General Stores' He changed it to Ersam. Nine times six is fifty four. Nine times seven is sixty three. Nine times eight is seventy. Nine times nine is seventy two. Nine times ten.. - Nine times eight is seventy two, stupid girl! Nine times ten.. - Nine times eight is seventy two, stupid girl! You are not even a graduate. How can you teach me? Realising that education is more valuable than experience he came here. Yes, get up. - Good evening, sir.. Good evening, everybody. Sit down. - Thank you, sir.. Welcome to night college. While the rest of the world is working hard after education all of you have come now to study here. So, let's not waste time. We will begin the class after quick introductions. Come on, quick. I am Naresh. I own a browsing centre in Balanagar. I am Babu. I am trying to get into movies. I am Dandu Subba Raju, MLA from Polavaram. I won with a majority of 1,25,000 votes. I am Mahroof. I am a gun supplier.. - Oh. ...for movies. I am Bhajan Lal. I own a jewellery shop in the old city, sir. I am Satya. I am a housewife. I am Bhasha. I run a welding shop, sir. I guess the person who was frustrated with darkness invented light bulb. That light laid the way to this night college. Come, I will drop you. - Okay.. Usually, my mother answers my call at the very first ring. But on that fine day, she didn't answer my call. And then two odd friends entered my life. Old man? Hey, whom are you calling that? - Oh! Sorry! Sir? What do you want, pal? Can you drop me at Madhapur? - Don't worry, Surya. I am going to Miyapur. Madhapur is just a stone's throw from Miyapur. Madhapur is just a stone's throw from Miyapur. Get in. Move in. - Oh, thank you. "You are a player. A magical deer.." On the very first day of college our principal stuffed us with enough problems in mathematics. I am kind of worked up with all this. It would be great if I get to have a cold beer now. I can relate to it. But where will you get it at this late in the night? I know. Here. Mr. Ramesh. - Yes? Why have you come in an auto? - Get me three Kulfis. Do you want Kulfi? Isn't your flavor butterscotch? Why are they talking about butterscotch and Kulfi? But we were asking for beer. I joined the night college today. I changed the flavor for fun. Oh, so this is not like once a month anymore. You will come here, frequently. Isn't it? - Yes.. Beer! - Why only three beers? Does this old man need beer? He's dead today. - How dare you call me an old man? We all are from the same class and we share the same bench. - Yes. Further, everyone is equal when it comes to beer. Why do you want to talk about his age, sir? Please give us the Kulfi and help us cool down! He's appears to be hot headed. Take this. The three of you remind me of 'Manam' movie poster. Only the dog is missing. - You can fit its role. How dare you? - Stop. Come let's have fun and drink beer. - Yes. This marks the beginning of our student life. From today, we'll have Kulfi every night. That's when I realised ageless friendship means making older people your friends. Cheers.. "Our minds are completely worked up." "It's the wee hours of the night." "The entire world appears to be against us." "Police has asked us to clear the spot." "Police has asked us to clear the spot." "Raise your bottles and say cheers." "Let's drink without a break." "Let's have fun." "Let's celebrate friendship." "Let's have fun." "Let's celebrate friendship." "Midnight is like a blackboard, it is all around us." "The moonlight is like a chalk." "Make friends and have a good time." "Life is greeting us with open arms." "Come! Let's have nonstop fun." "Come! Let's have nonstop fun." "If you miss out on such good days, life is wasted." "We live during the day" "and have fun at night. Let's ensure to stay like this" "and bond our friendship well." "Irrespective of age, size, range and caste" "friends must be like us." "Let's have fun." "Let's celebrate friendship." "Let's have fun." - It's good. A old man, a middle aged man and a young boy. What's good about it? - Oh, no! - Hey! Move aside. I will play. Yes, kick! Mr. Ersam.. defend.. - Yes.. - They won! This is what happens when you play football with hands! I won't play anymore. Helmet and jacket are compulsory. Oh my! Are you happy now? Okay? Guys, welcome to my entertainment zone. My terrace! Superb! Come along. I've given him potato chips. It's Tomato tango Spanish flavour. "Nights are colorful and alive." "Let's have fun playing games." "Let's forget our silly fights and move on" "until the sun rises the following morning." "This kingdom is entirely ours. Come, let's have fun." "Let's take an oath upon Charminar to be friends for years to come." "Let's have fun." "Let's celebrate friendship." "Let's celebrate friendship." "Let's have fun." "Let's celebrate friendship." You can achieve nothing in life if you score zeros like this. That won't happen, sir. I run an auto. I don't care about all that. These marks and your attitude should not be repeated. Get out, useless fellows! Hey, old man! Wait there. Leave me. - I asked you to wait. Why are you stopping them? You are old enough. Aren't you ashamed to be sketching principal's pictures on walls? Do you think you are Picasso? Listen, if you repeat this again I will forget my age and punish you. Useless fellow. Instead of principal, I should have drawn his face. Is this a bedroom or a store room? Shubha.. why have you not cleaned this? What do I do? Your son is drinking with his friends on the terrace. I was arranging snacks for them. What should I do, ma'am? Arrange it. If not at this age, when will they have fun? It is fine if he is drinking with friends of his age. But I feel irritated to see him drink with such old people. On top of that, the old fellow wants fried chicken. The auto driver wants prawns. Arrange whatever his friends ask. Why are you thinking so much, Surya? Are you afraid of today's test? Forget everything and enjoy your drink. There's something I have to tell you about me. - Okay. I have a rare genetic disorder. A condition related to Porphyria. What is that? In simple terms I will die if I come out in the sunlight. March 3, 1992. March 3, 1992. While my mom was pregnant with me my father died in an accident, plunging our lives into darkness. Thereafter, the doctor said I can never see the sunlight and cast my life in darkness forever. Neither my husband nor I have this disorder. How did my son get it? You think your husband had no such problems. See! Porphyria Cutanea Tarda. A disease which results in decrease of hemoglobin. In simple terms hemoglobin is a vital component in every human being. But the enzyme producing this hemoglobin will be very low in people with this disease. There's a strange fact about this. One among 1,000 people with this disease will have no symptoms. However, one among crore will show all symptoms. Fortunately, your husband was one among the thousands. Unfortunately, your son is one in a crore. Unfortunately, your son is one in a crore. Do you mean that if he is taken out in the sunlight will he tan? Usually it takes four to five hours for a kid to get tanned. But your son will get tanned in less than five minutes. In the next ten minutes, he will lose his sight. In the next fifteen minutes, his skin will be scorched. So, do I have to keep Surya indoors throughout his life? Not for his entire life. He should be kept indoors until 6.30 p.m. every day. In other words, Surya is a vampire. Don't panic. I am not trying to scare you. I am only trying to explain. Even in such a tragic situation, it's ironic that your mother named you Surya. Look, dear. This is sun. Since I could never see sun in my life my mother got little creative and gave me that name. Never go out in the sun! Never go out in the sun! Okay? - Okay. Are you trying to fool us, pal? Have you never seen the sun until now? Hey.. - Mom.. - Surya.. Vitamin D enables bone formation. But you can't generate vitamin D without going out in the Sun. and inject vitamin D in me. It's over, dear.. - Mom.. It is over, calm down. Now see what I will do. It's only for those five minutes that I saw the sun. That's it. Once my bones were strong enough I didn't even see sun's picture. Does that mean you can never come out in daylight, Surya? Does that mean you can never come out in daylight, Surya? Why not? Rain will stop and clouds will disperse. The sun will come out after that. He will kill you. If you ever step out before 6.30 p.m. again I will break your legs. Go and enjoy now. So you have never been to school is it? What is the need for you to attend school? You can watch TV play video games or watch movies. If you really want to, we will go for late night movies. People study and struggle to earn money. You have enough money to last a lifetime. But everyone else is going to school. All of them look for shade from the sun. You have no such necessity at all. Edison who invented the bulb never attended school. Not just Edison. Many more like Newton and Ramanujan didn't like going to school. School is boring, my son. Eat happily and go to sleep. Eat happily and go to sleep. Life is not just about eating and sleeping, Surya. A human being should have a creative and colourful life. Look at me, I used to perform on TV. Aruna can impress girls with his driving skills. What about you? What are your talents? It's my hobby to play with toy cars. It got little serious. I started playing with real cars. - Driver, take me to the market. After that, I got my license. I have enough fun with all cars. Can you drive better than me? Help! Someone save me! Help! Someone save me! Looks like I am going to die in this car. Even with license, drunken driving is hazardous, Surya. Police will check for drunken driving. Only now I understand why you come in my auto despite having a car at home. Please stop, Surya. My lover is dependent on me. Why are you speeding? - Stop. Driving car in high speed fixing the parts even faster is all the talent I have, Mr. Ersam. You could have explained it. Why do you have to exhibit? Besides, I know boxing too. We don't want a demonstration. I am feeling sober now. I should definitely eat something now. Also, it is weekend. During the weekends, I usually hangout at two joints. One is a crowded restaurant, Alam Dulillah. It's okay. Hey! What nonsense, fool! - I will trash you. Shut up and eat. Second, something that cools me down after I eat Biryani. Popsicle! Sir, why have you stopped coming here? Have you forgotten my popsicles? In fact, I've chosen you as my customer of the year, sir. Is that so? It looks like a black and white photograph. That's why, the three of us will have three colas. Take. - Here is the money. Thank you so much. With your grace, I have upgraded from cart to van. You are great. Here you go. Oh, it's wonderful, Surya. Enjoy, sir. Yes! Hey, Surya. Watch it! Hey. Ignore them. There are too many drunkards in the city these days. Please take another popsicle. - Idiots! Please take another popsicle. - Idiots! Is is the same flavour? - How is it? Thank you, it's superb. Excuse me, are you injured? No, I am fine. Thank you. Great. - How's it, Surya? Come, let's try popsicle today. Finally, the heroine has arrived in the story. No, she is not a heroine. The one sitting behind her is the heroine. Did she come to have popsicle? This popsicle is made out of ice from the mortuary. I don't want it. Sir, you don't worry. Our ice is made from mineral water. Really? - Look ma'am, it is your choice to have popsicle or not. Don't talk rubbish before my valuable customers and hamper my business. Hey, shut up and come. - You don't worry, sir. 'Kaala Katta', rose orange, mango.. 'Picha' fruit? What is 'Picha' fruit? I will tell you. Navittam Picha. That's a fruit. Mad about movies, that's another fruit. Being mad about love, it is a big fruit. If you need the best of the lot you must try our 'Picha' fruit flavour. Trust me. Don't you believe me yet? Can you see the handsome and fair guy like me there? He is the customer of the year. You can ask him. It's really good.. It's v-very nice. Every day, he has 'Picha' fruit flavour. Her name is Sanjana. She is an anchor of a late night show on Television. I am in love with her for almost two years now. But she also does not know about it. How is that possible? - Simple. I fell in love with her watching her on TV. Until then, I'd seen her only on live show. She was finally standing in front of me. First time! Even though I had my favourite popsicle in my hand I couldn't take my eyes off her. The next day.. "What use are eyes devoid of the iris?" "What is the use of such eyes?" If you like her so much, you must blindly fall in love. But I have a big problem! Even in the movie 'Ghajini', the hero had heroines. Nayantara and Asin. That is a movie.. - Let alone hero Suriya. Even our friend, Auto Aruna has successfully wooed a girl. He bunks college and roams around the city. Right! All these diseases and situations are never a hindrance for love, Surya. So do you think I too can woo that girl, Mr. Ersam? If your love is true you can impress her grandmother too. Her grandmother? - I have an idea. First, what is the occupation of that girl? 'Let's see if you can answer.' 'Hi! Hello! Welcome to' 'Suraksh TV presenting 'Let's see if you can answer.'' She is the one. 'This is the celebrity you have to recognize today. Ta-da!' 'Without wasting time, let's see who our first caller is.' That's the show. - 'Dial 040-34593459' That's the show. - 'Dial 040-34593459' 'Why are you still waiting?' I didn't expect you to have such a wild taste, Surya. 'Our first caller is ready. Mr. Bujji, where are you from?' 'From Pragathi Nagar. - Oh! It's a beautiful place, Mr. Bujji!' 'Guess the name of the celebrity flashing on your TV screen.' 'You have four options.' '1. Vijayakanth.' '2. Narayana Murthy.' '3. Mahesh Babu.' '4. Rajasekhar.' 'Come on, you should tell us quickly.' 'If your guess is right, you can win Rs. 25,000!' 'Rs. 25,000 as gift money!' 'Come on! Time is running out, Mr. Bujji from Pragathi Nagar.' 'Come on..' - Mahesh Ba.. - 'Narayana Murthy!' 'Is it Narayana Murthy?' 'That's a wrong answer, Mr. Bujji.' 'You missed it by a whisker.' What kind of show is this? Why is this girl hosting it? Why do you like her? She is such a talkative girl. Will she allow you to speak? - 'But still, stay positive.' 'Call us. Keep trying.' - Oh yes, we will.. 'Let's see who is the next lucky caller in our programme.' - Sound.. 'Hello..' 'Hello..' 'Who is this?' - Take a guess! 'Who else it could be?' 'Since two years' 'you are the only caller who is regularly calling our show.' 'Surya, the sun.' For two years.. - Yes. Are you crazy? 'If you grace us with your presence' 'we'll click a picture of you and put it up in our studio.' Then why didn't you click a picture when you met me other day? It's me. I was near the popsicle van. 'Picha' fruit flavour, customer of the year! I.. - Don't you remember us, dear? 'Picha' fruit flavoured popsicle.. 'M-Mr. Surya, forget about all that' 'and guess who this celebrity is.' 'Rs. 25,000 is waiting for you.' - He is Krishna's son Mahesh Babu! You look very beautiful, madam. 'I know that I am very beautiful, Surya.' 'But that does not matter now.' 'For the last two years, you've failed to win Rs. 25,000.' 'Try to win at least today, Surya.' Come on, Surya. You will win 25000. Tell her it is Mahesh Babu. 'Come on..' 'Quickly..' - When will you come to have a popsicle again? What nonsense! - 'Time is up.' - Mahesh Babu.. 'Bad luck, Surya.' What a waste of time! 'But thank you so much for your presence.' 'I will definitely come someday to have a popsicle.' 'Better luck next time.' Your love story hasn't even started yet and you already lost Rs. 25,000. She has promised to come for popsicle, Mr. Ersam. She recognises me. Yes! "Since my granddaughter insulted me." "I joined the night college." "Now, I am bunking college to have 'Picha' fruit flavour popsicle" "and I am ruining my future." "Charlie Chaplin, can you please tell me." "Is this comedy or a tragedy? You tell me." I understand now. Are studies more important to you than our friend's love? Sir, one more 'Picha' fruit flavoured popsicle. If you wait here sucking on popsicles she won't come for you, Surya. I have an idea. If she does not come here, why don't we go to her? That's not appropriate. We shouldn't go there without a proper plan. You start the car. Hey, you get your van too. If it costs Rs. 10,000 just for an introduction how much will it cost to love? How much will it cost to get married? Will the girl at least have come here for the show? Why will she not come? She must have already come. It's her daily programme. It is better to call once, Surya. - Go ahead. He is right. 'Let's see who our next caller is. - Hello, I am Surya.' 'Hi, Surya. How are you?' 'Where are you calling from?' Where else? I am right below your office. 'Okay, Surya.' 'Let's get back to the show.' 'Guess the name of the celebrity flashing on your TV screen' 'and win Rs. 25,000.' 'Rs. 25,000!' I am not in front of a TV now. 'Oh, is it so? Time is running out, Surya.' 'Okay, I will give you a clue.' 'He is like a bullet which is six feet tall.' 'Recently, he starred a sentimental movie.' 'Recently, he starred a sentimental movie.' 'It was a super hit.' The youth know him! He is the terror for his mother-in-law 'and darling for his wife.' 'Megastar Chiranjeevi.' It is Power star Pavan Kalyan. - Oh! Hello, sir. This is called generation gap. 'It's the first I'm talking to you without seeing you on screen.' 'Time is running out, Surya.' - It's cool. 'Time is up!' 'You will not change. Better luck next time.' 'A small break before we talk to our next caller.' 'We will be right back, stay tuned with us.' If you receive one more call from that number, block it. We have only two regular callers. One is this guy and the second is your wife. If we block these people we will have to rob in the night time for a living! Please order coffee. I'm feeling sleepy. Hello. Ma'am, how come you left the show in between and came here? Ma'am, how come you left the show in between and came here? Will you have a popsicle? Are you trying to show off before the media? Have you shifted your popsicle business here? Well, I don't know anything. He gave me money and he brought me here in his vehicle. I don't know anything. You can take this if you want it. Do you really want this girl, Surya? Though you are so intelligent, don't you know about Pawan Kalyan? I am a big fan of his. But if I recognize him, you will not talk to me again. What a line! - What? Are you trying to woo me? Give me your phone. Do not call every night. They are planning to block your number. That's reasonable. This is my number. Call me directly from now on. I do not get wooed easily. You can try. Try sincerely though. You can try. Try sincerely though. "My heart is following" "you" "just like a shadow. Look at his true love." "How deep the love is, dying for you." "You are in every breath of his." "See how deep is the love and longing." "He is dying for you." "His breath is filled with thoughts of you." "Oh dear, God!" "Oh dear, God!" "Oh dear, God!" "Baby! You got me." "New sunshine in this night, yes." "I never want to let you go." "Your love makes me float in the air." "I'm finally with you, Sanjana.." "Love is happiness." "Love is exhilarating." "Love is frolic, this minute is full of joy." "The untouchable sky and the beautiful spring season" "is rushing towards me." I hate this life. A normal person should wake up early in the morning exercise, eat breakfast and go to office. Later in the evening, you must spend time with your family. I hate this night life. Yes, I agree. These are my friends from night college. Hello, this is Mr. Ersam. - Greetings. - Hi. Hello, this is Mr. Ersam. - Greetings. - Hi. I am Aruna Sai. - Hi. - This is my auto. Not bad. Going by his choice of friends I thought he'll choose an old lady. I am feeling relieved now. Give me two Kulfis, sir. Our brand? - No! - One minute, ma'am. No? I know people's preferences, sir. "It's so thrilling to have you beside me." "My heart takes off like an airplane." "Every streetlight is shining like your smile." "You are like a cascading fragrant waterfall" "and as you twitch your sweet lips, I am drenched." "Like a radium watch." "I am swept away by your laughter." "Oh, my love" "Oh, my love" "my first day breaks shine just like you." "Look! How deep love and longing is." "He is dying for you." "His breath is filled with your thoughts." "Allah.." "Allah.." "Praise the Lord.." - This is my vision board. I have pictures of my friends, relatives, family my memories, goals and everything else. If you want to know about me all you need to do is take a look at this board. Today, you are becoming a part of this board. Congratulations, Mr. Surya. "Love is happiness. Love is exhilarating." "Love is happiness. Love is exhilarating." "Love is frolic, this minute is full of joy." "The untouchable sky and the beautiful spring season" "is rushing towards me." Surya, a small gift for you. What is this? - Sunglasses. What is this? - Sunglasses. Shut up. Sir is studying in a night college. Instead of sunglasses, you could have given peg glasses! That's not the idea of this gift. You are scared to look into my eyes and talk to me. This may give you some courage. Shall we go out tomorrow? Okay. We will go for lunch tomorrow. Okay, tomorrow afternoon.. No.. I can't make it tomorrow afternoon. I have some work. Also, it is Mr. Ersam's birthday. How about dinner? Okay, bye. - Bye. Hello, sir. It's me. What's with these glasses, meeting and dating? Do you even realize what you are saying? Do you even realize what you are saying? Going for dinner with a girl does not only mean binging on food. You need to spend some time with her. Girls are like a poppadum. She will not soften unless she is dipped in love. What if I don't do so? Simple! Some other guy flee her away! - Is it so? Don't get tense, Surya. In order to impress your girl, you'll have to cross three stages. Stage 1: Be well dressed with flowers in your hand and a smile on the face. Be confident. Not bad! Surya, for good luck get into the car with your right foot first. - Okay. How did you like the roses? One rose is enough to impress me. When that girl gets into your car for the first time you should not let her get off at least before an hour. The destination might be close by but you should take her around the place. Round and round, keep driving. Where are we headed, Surya? You've been going in circles for an hour. The moment she says that we should reach the destination. Did you bring me to Lumbini Park after driving for so long? Don't take it easily because it is Lumbini Park. Just like how an old auto will have good pickup going to a park is equally exciting. What's there in the park? Wow! You reserved the boat exclusively for us? Stop eating and say something, pal. Even though we have a budget, there's no place on the boat. That's why I booked only one table. Please take care.. - Thank you! Reservation for Aruna? Yes, it's me. - Come, sir. Come on, ma'am. Please come! How is it, sir? - Nice. - Aruna has explained everything. Thank you! - Stage 2: In this stage, you are on the boat. The restaurant in the boat the people in the restaurant and the songs they hear lights shining brightly in the distance. All these will decide the mood of the girl. All you have to do is to impress the girl with your talks. - He's right. is to impress the girl with your talks. - He's right. I understood. It's Tank Bund, isn't it? It might be a little stinky. I've made arrangements for that too. Nice place. It's romantic, isn't it? Calm and peaceful. "This man is fierce like a chilly." "Like a chilly.." "Twirling his moustache, like a missile he leaped into action." "Like a chilly.." Chicken! Enjoy! Hey, Aruna! Your name is Surya. You are busy during the day and I don't like this night life. You are busy during the day and I don't like this night life. But after meeting you I am enjoying the night life too. I am impressed. Perfect! This is when you have to impress the girl further. However, you cannot do it. That's why, leave me a missed call. I will make sure that you will witness more surprises. Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Good evening, ma'am. Nonsense! Isn't he juggling well? Everyone is staring at us. It's embarrassing, Surya. Please send him away. Okay, it was good. Sir, money? Oh, hasn't Aruna given it? - No. Come with me. I did not expect this from Aruna. Sir, I am short of cash. I only have cards. Please collect it tomorrow. Don't you watch movies? If you have no money, give me your watch. Excuse me? There's no big difference between you and me. I am a joker in a circus. You are one in real life. Since he is an artist, I encouraged him but he disappointed me. Horrible fellow. Second surprise: You will be chocked when you see this surprise! Sir! Please leave. Money? Armani! Where is your blazer? Surya! Please! - Oh, God! If we had to go to the circus, we could have gone next week! Those arrangements were not made by me, Sanjana. I know. All these are ideas of that auto driver. Who asked you to do all this? Be yourself. That's enough. At this stage tell her the truth that you are a sun that rises in dark. and that she is the light in your life. and that she is the light in your life. Sanjana, I need to tell you the truth. Do you have a license? No, sir. Rs. 1,000 for not having a license. Another Rs. 1,000 for roaming with a girl at this hour. How much in total? Rs. 2,000. Give me! One minute, please. Apart from this credit card, I don't have any money, sir. Oh! Come, let's go to the police station. Please, sir.. - Come on, move. Sir.. - Move! Sanjana. Don't worry. Sir, excuse me? Please, sir. We are students. Please spare us! The petrol tank is full. I must go home. What shall we do? Where is your house, sir? Kompalle. - Kompalle? T-That's far off, sir. Police station is close by. You can save on petrol too. So, what shall we do? Oh, perfume.. Tattered flowers! It's a nice set up. What were you both up to? - That's none of your business. Oh, are you running a business? What? Hello, Kondala Rao. Do you want to know where I am? I am traveling in a car with a guy who has no license a girl who runs her own business and I am with them. What else can I do, pal? I am doing what a villain does between a hero and heroine. Get down. Out! Do you want go to the Station? Okay, let's go. If you want money, take it. This is my business card. Tomorrow morning, collect Rs. 4,000 instead of Rs. 2,000. If you speak anything rubbish about her you will never go to Kompalle. You can get this serious too? Neither did I know this before. Do you know something? They say that the sun has lot of willpower. You're the same. The difference is that he knows that very well. But you don't know it. They say the sun has lot of willpower. It is the same with you. It is the same with you.. Everything arrived this morning, ma'am. - Okay.. What is the price for this? - Rs. 50. And this one? Rs. 125 per dozen, ma'am. Hey, she's the TV anchor! Give me a dozen of this. - Welcome to Suraksh TV. Let's see if you can answer! The celebrity's name that you have to guess today is here with us. You can win Rs. 25,000 if you guess the girl's name correctly. The number you need to dial for guessing is 040-34593459. You are good at mimicking! But idle rogues like you shouldn't be dialing 040-34593459. Instead, try dialing 100! Let's see who our lucky caller is for the day! Let's see who our lucky caller is for the day! This is Salim, from Monda market. Hello, Salim. Tell me the name of the girl who is standing before you. Tell me what do you think of her. This girl wears short dresses on TV for the late night show. I would like to see what she wears at home. If you want to see you have to pay Rs. 25,000. - Rs. 25,000... Hello. Hello, Surya. - What happened? Come to Monda market immediately. Pal, she has a boyfriend already. - She is cautious. Yes, pal. - Call him.. What can he do alone? Okay, I've understood the problem. Give me your address. I will send the police immediately. Please, shut up! - Ask the guy to bring flowers too. Don't you hear those dirty comments, Surya? He is the sun and she is the moon! Sanjana, do this. Note down their phone number or vehicle number. I will not spare a single fellow after 6:30 p.m. Oh, my moon. Come to me. Their comments are irritating me, Surya. Without a second thought, I called you instead of calling my dad. That is my faith in you. I don't know whether you will come at 6:30 or 7:30. It's your wish, Surya. But, I will stay here till you come. No matter what they do to me. So, don't you have the chance to come out at day, Surya? "Only for you.. The sun that shines brightly has disappeared." "Your cold stare.. can begin torrential rains." "You are the one to protect yourself." "You have to put an end to all injustice." "Step forward like a tornado and break the manacles." "Shine as bright as the sun behind the clouds." "As valour is sun's mask, courage is yours." "You shall overshadow the powerful sun like an eclipse." "Emerge forceful enough to beat the sun." "If you have the confidence within you" "you can win over the universe." Who are you? Come on. Come on! "You are the one to bring out the new side in me" "just like a mirror." "You give me the confidence" "You give me the confidence" to fight the war." "With each step forward, the darkness is going away." "If you dominate over your weakness, your dawn will rise." Love is so powerful that it brought me out in daylight. But it also hid my true identity and hushed me before her. You forgot your limitations and fought in the broad daylight. You forgot your limitations and fought in the broad daylight. You could've fought at night if you wanted to impress that girl. We two would have come and thrashed them. - Hey! What are these bills? Where are you swiping your credit card? A police officer visited the office and collected Rs. 4,000. The car is full of dents. Hey! Are you participating in racing and boxing competitions again? You tell me, Aruna. What happened? I don't know, ma'am. I drop Surya at home daily and go back home in my auto, ma'am. Since we go in the same direction I get dropped in the same auto, ma'am. I very well know about all three of you! I also know the reason for this. Sanjana. You can stop acting innocent now. I called over 20 times to talk to you. I called over 20 times to talk to you. But you didn't answer. I answered. When there is ample light in your room why not leave the curtains open? T-That's because of the odour, Sanjana. A dump yard is just around here. - Y-Yes.. Okay. Come, let's go out. Outside.. Start quickly. Today is an important day. But it's only 3 p.m. now. It will be four p.m. in another hour. But, it will be seven after three hours. Surya, didn't I tell you it's important? I must shower. Okay, I will wait. Come quickly. Manage the situation somehow. Damn, Surya! He takes hours to shower. Yes, Surya. - Sanjana. Apart from calls, you messaged me too? Yes. - I am sorry! I did not notice. It's okay. Hurry up. I wonder how I missed it. That's alright. Just hurry up. - Sanjana, that's not the point. My phone is always on. How did I miss it? Surya, I will slap you if you don't shower and come out quickly. Oh! I will call Mr. Ersam. Hello. - What's the situation? Very bad. - What do we do now? "You and me are one and the same. What's yours is mine too, darling." "If you don't linger in the shower for four hours, you're a goner!" That's philosophy.. Please do something, Mr. Ersam. What can I do, Surya? Oh, no! - Surya? I-I meant my wife. Her name is Suryakantham. Her nick name is Surya. - Yes. Listen Suryakantam, go and visit the doctor now. We'll manage next time. Okay? No choice! I have to get out. She is diabetic and I have high blood pressure. Aruna? - Yes? There's no water to shower. Call for a water tanker immediately. Okay.. Hello, water supplier? My friend is taking a shower and there's no water. Send a water tanker immediately. It won't come before 6:30 p.m. - What? You can't send it before 6:30 p.m.? What do we do? Several lovers are dependent on water. I mean, they plan to go out before it is dark. There will be several problems. Shall we send normal water in that case? No way! Normal water is not good enough for us. We want only Manjeera water. We don't mind waiting till 6:30 p.m. Okay. Until then, play some movie for her. Look for DVDs there. - Okay. Sanjana. Shall we go and watch a movie? I asked because Aruna's auto is free. We can go later. Don't mistake me! Do we have to go out to watch a movie? There are so many DVDs here. We can watch something. There are so many actors. It must be a lengthy movie. It might be. Sanjana. Why a movie now? We are going out in sometime anyway. Arrange for that water tanker soon. Water tanker is on the way. It's not for you though. We will watch the movie. - Yes. 'Catch it.' The tiles need to be changed. Blue will be better. No, we first need to change the commode. "Sometimes there's happiness. Sometimes there's sorrow." What's this? It's really a long movie! What do you think he is doing in there? - Who knows? "You are.. Darling!" "You are.. Darling!" "You are.. Darling!" 'Shut up..' Look at you! "You occupy every breath of mine." "My whole life is under Your shadow." "I worship You always." - Sanjana? "I worship You always." "Sometimes there's happiness. Sometimes there's sorrow." You said you wanted go somewhere. "We shall not be separated." "Sometimes there's happiness. Sometimes there's sorrow." Oh.. my God! I-It's a cemetary! Oh, is it my birthday today? It's my birthday today. For my birthday I bought a cake and called you on your phone. As you didn't answer my call. I picked you up and brought you here. I arranged for the cake and candle. But what are you doing? Are you waiting for me to cut the cake so that you can eat it? Birthday wishes are minimum expectations, Surya. You didn't meet that at least. Do you know why we came here? This is my mother's grave. My mom died immediately after I was born. But I never really missed her But I never really missed her because I could visualize her in my dad's words. That's why I always believe in the power of words. It's only a human being who can express his feelings. But you will never do so. Yet, you didn't wish me though I blabbered so much. Happy b.. - How can I expect you to tell me what's in your heart? That's why, I am expressing it myself. I love you, Surya. She proposed and made my love story successful. Whereas, if I said the same thing in return it would fail. That's my fate. My love story ended before it even started. - "I stare silently." "Though my heart is full of love." "Though my heart is full of love." "Though my eyes stop me every time" "I look at her always." "The silence of moonlight asks me" "what went wrong." "Tears in my eyes are rippling waves." "Love always results in pain." When the girl you love is beside you and if you still fail to tell the truth, it's torturous. This should help you, sir. Yes. Sanjana, are you ready? Good news! I've been moved to a morning programme on TV. I am so happy. Finally, its a goodbye to night life after tonight. "I can't stay in that light. I can't see you during the day." "I can't stay away from you. I cannot face you and tell you." "I cannot hide the truth and unite with you." "I cannot show you the reality." "I am stuck in the darkness which will never break into daylight." "The silence of moonlight asks me" "what went wrong." "what went wrong." Yes! Once upon a time, I was the only one on your vision board. Later, your friends entered and now, this guy. After few months, I may not be on this board anymore. I decided to end the torture I was going through. Only for namesake, you supply guns for movies. You can't even afford toothpaste. I want you to pay my money by tomorrow. Pay cash and take your goods. Leave. What's new, Surya? Sanjana's dad asked me to go to their house at nine tomorrow. That means we will hear wedding bells soon! The invitation is not for dinner, it's for breakfast. You both go to her house tomorrow and tell her the truth. How can we go? That's silly! We will not go. Surya could not come, sir. That's why, he sent us. Surya could not come, sir. That's why, he sent us. It's Sunday! He said he would come. His phone is switched off too. Are you related to Surya? We are closer than that, sir. We're good friends. You are friends in business? How would I get into business? I am an auto driver. He owns a small kiosk.. I mean, he runs a big retail store. Why did he send you guys? - That's because.. That's because.. we all are aware that Sanjana and Surya are in love. But, there is one aspect which you both are not aware of. You see, sweetmeats are sweet but few facts are bitter. That's why I will eat sweet and he will tell the truth. - What? Tell him. You are not naive, sir. Love is not a temporary thing. It is permanent. The problem is that what Surya has is also permanent. H-He has a strange disease, sir. Porphyria Tarda... You better explain what it means. He will die if he goes out in the sunlight. Surya's life starts after 6:30 p.m., sir. He tried to tell you about this couple of times, Sanjana. But he failed. I sent my friends to tell the truth but both of them misconstrued me. I am a journalist. Bringing out the truth is my profession. I have high respect for my job. But I love my daughter even more. You have insulted both my love and respect. How dare you come here? We advised you to tell the truth, Surya. We advised you to tell the truth, Surya. You did not. Do you see the result now? It just got tough, Surya. Forget her. He thrashed us black and blue. How do I face my lover now? The cause of your happiness is responsible for your pain today. It is okay when sorrow arises due to situations but not because of people. Okay. Please forget him. He's not worth it. She simply ended it with a message saying it was over. That's why, this time I went to her house to reveal the truth. I will have a beer. You have this cool drink, ma'am. Cheers! Anyone who knows about me asks why I fell in love. Despite being completely aware of everything I am not sure how I fell for your daughter, ma'am. But I loved her sincerely. I risked my life and fought for her. What was the result? She just sent a message saying it's over. Despite having my favourite popsicle in front of me I would still think about your daughter. However, your daughter cannot understand all this, ma'am. Your daughter is not at fault, ma'am. Her only fault was that she loved me. When my mom had a minor sun stroke I sent lemons with Mr. Ersam since I could not go. What if it was a major stroke? I realise now, ma'am. I am unfit to take good care of my mother. How can I take good care of your daughter, ma'am? You are dead and I am alive. And yet it does not make much of a difference. I am a living corpse. Tomorrow onwards, I will continue to wake up in the evening. I will not call Sanjana. I will watch TV. But I will not watch her show. I will eat popsicles, but will not think about her. I will eat popsicles, but will not think about her. I will attend college, but I will not bunk classes for her. I will lead a routine life till the end and finally, I'll die and come here. If I have to do all this I should forget Sanjana. To forget her I should return something to you. Glasses! Are you mad? Why did you tell all this to a grave? What happened after that? I started trying to forget Sanjana. And on one bad morning.. 'After offering your prayers to the sun this morning' 'Welcome to all those waiting for me.' 'Welcome to all those waiting for me.' What's this? 'I am now read today's first mail.' 'It's Chandu from Mysore.' 'I have night blindness.' 'Without informing that, I fell in love with a girl named Sujatha.' 'I'm now struggling to reveal the truth.' 'Chandu, your first mistake was to lie to the girl you love.' 'Informing me via mail is the second mistake.' 'If you are really courageous, tell your girl the truth.' 'Or else, simply die.' 'That's why it's better to be single and happy.' 'Stay away from love.' After that, I got rid of my TV. Very good. Next time, she came face to face with me at college. Hey, is this really a college? This is nothing! You will find three idiots inside. My fate. We thought you will bring fame to our show with your sweet talks. We thought you will bring fame to our show with your sweet talks. Instead, you got too personal with someone's message and our show flopped. Give me one more chance. Please, sir. Okay, do this. Today evening, cultural programme held in a college. You go and cover that programme. We'll see. Okay sir, I can do it. Which college is that? - M.S.K night college. That college? N-No.. Only night programmes are ideal for her. If I complete this coverage I can peacefully do day programs. Why that innocent look? I am the Lord of Hell. I am Yama, the God of death. I've come to take the life of your pious husband, Satyavan! Didn't you promise to bless me with me a boon? - Yes, I shall! Except the life of your husband Except the life of your husband I will give you anything. Any doubts? Pal, you are superb! It was mind blowing! The person who was playing Yama's role was overdoing it. We'll edit his.. - Point your fame there, Karthik. It's colourful. There is nothing good about that frame. I am not doing it. What is your problem? I've been observing you. Did you leave him because he lied to you? Or because he has a problem? Do you have any clarity at all? Karthik, switch on the camera. Let's shoot. Seriously? Do whatever you want. Hey, Sanju. Oh, what a response! Do you want some, pal? Surya.. You deserve it. Did you bother listening to me? Whoa! Did you see how he has dressed up? This is why I tell you that falling in love is a useless thing. It's never wrong to love. It's a mistake not to express it sincerely. However sincere I may be no one in this world would love me. I was distraught in love. You kidnapped me and brought me to this island. The first half of this story is tasty like sweet Paan. The second half is insipid like regular Paan. Sir, I get it now. The sun is not the problem in your story. Your silence is! Silence. Silence. Your mom provided you with everything since your childhood. You never got a chance to show your emotion. But it's not the same with girlfriends. To ensure our feelings are understood by them we have to show our emotions and tell them verbally. we have to show our emotions and tell them verbally. Talking to walls, tombs, the sun or me whom you met only couple of hours ago is of no use. If you had gone to her directly and told her what's in your heart, it would do. By now you both would have been united. It would have had a happy ending. This situation would never have cropped up. Only a human being can express his inner feelings. But you would not. "Like a water bearing cloud, my heart "is filled with love." "This minute as a rainfall" "let it fall with love." "My whole life is filled with silence." "This silence is killing me." "This silence is killing me." "A sweet dream was ruined just like that" "by a high tide of silence." Battery died in the auto. And your story ended too. Liquor is also exhausted. Why are there so many bottles here? Hey, it's been our regular spot since the last two years. Be it parties, threats kidnapping or picnic. We do everything here. Naturally, there will be a lot of bottles. Collect all the bottles. We will leave this island. What will you do with the bottles? Bottles float in water. This is enough to build a boat. Are you a scientist? It is general physics. We need a rope to build a boat with these bottles. Rope? You can't find that here! He's asking for impossible things. What does he think of me? Does he think there's a super market is here? Give me that knife in your pocket. This is not a knife. It has multipurpose utility. It has a knife, screwdriver, an opener and laser too. Laser? Why do you need that? When the power fails in theatres I use this to have fun. What's in it for you? Do we go to a movie just to watch? I'm not the sort. That is why I use a laser. - Drat! Okay, with your multipurpose utility cut this rexine into a rope. cut this rexine into a rope. Like a rope. I will look for an auto. - Why an auto? These bottles are not enough. We need the auto too. Do they teach so much in night colleges? Hey.. What are you doing? Give it to me. It's done like that. That's not the way you cut it. You should cut it in a straight line. See.. Straight line! Straight line. Sir, what are you doing? The auto won't function without an engine. Our boat will not work if there is too much weight. Come on.. Auto should float. Fasten it tightly. It has to float. Very good job.. How's our boat, pal? This looks like scrap, not a boat. Driver, start the vehicle. Shut up and sit straight. The boat is unstable. You row wonderfully, friend. One song for you. "My love is across the river." - Keep that aside first. "and I am on the other end of the bank." "Oh rower, take me across the river." "My love is across the river. Hey, rower!" "Hey, rower!" "Hey, rower!" - Zubair! Be careful with your knife! - "Hey, rower.." Hey! You cut the rope! Bloody fool! You cut the bottles too. Don't move.. We are sinking. Hey! - Jump out fast. Get down! Hey, Zubair I built this with so much effort, you rascal! You destroyed it. Sir.. It happened accidentally. I understood. I have a lighter. I will set up a campfire. I will get a peg too. Miserable fellow! It's not the boat you sank, it's my life. How did you come into my life? Do you whom you challenged? Do you know whose support I have? Zubair, Zen Zubair Old City Tiger. I will kill you! Sir.. Lord Ganesh helped you when you fought. Look again closely. It will rain at 6:00 a.m. The fishermen will come at 6:30 AM We will be home by 7 a.m. It's five now. I used to reach home by 4:30 a.m. Mom must be awake already. She must have noticed my absence. I will see my first sunrise and you will see your last one. My mother will kill you. Don't be tense, ma'am. Ones who fail in love come home drunk these days. We have already informed the commissioner. He said that once they find him he will be dropped in a vehicle which does not let sunlight in. In my love story, there's no romance or even a lip lock. It's just plain and clean. Such a sad life I have. "You are the reason why I smile." When life seems hopeless - "I hum.." one feels like doing something risky. - "...because of you." "I cannot live without you, my love." Oh, God.. - Oh, no.. Pal.. Who the hell are you? Who.. Who are these people? Who are you both? We are college students, pal. - College students? We are college students, pal. - College students? What are college students doing here? What can we do, pal? After the car window tints are banned lovers have lost privacy, pal. That is why we came to this island. Fool, is this how you misuse the island? Zubair, wait! Pal. How did you come here? By boat, pal. - A boat? W-Where is the boat? You were sitting on it. It's underneath the idol, pal. That's our boat. We hid it so that no one could see. After creating problem that could kill me After creating problem that could kill me the solution was hidden under my seat. Just like this boat. God is crazy. "Oh! This river flows like music." "River merges with the sea." "Wonder where the sea merges." "Who would know?" Please drink this juice, madam.. You will feel better. I am here with you. Please drink this. Get lost. I knew he would come. I starved unnecessarily. Get lost. I'm hungry, mom. Can you feed me? My hands are not clean. Mom.. Please stop! Mom! You think you are a hero. That's why you said nobody likes you like a movie dialogue and left. What have I been doing for the last 20 years? Was it social service? This is nothing when you compare it with my love for you. I will not feed you. Eat it yourself and leave. I haven't accepted myself in the last 20 years. But you accepted me 20 years ago. You are really stubborn, Mom. You are so stubborn that you are beating me without even realising that you are fixing me a meal. Look! Mom, you smiled. You smiled, Mom. You have been telling me since my childhood that everyone looks for shade in sunlight, but I don't need it. that everyone looks for shade in sunlight, but I don't need it. I did not understand then, Mom that the shade is you. Will you not feed me until I praise you? Just as Buddha received knowledge under a tree you received it on the banks of a lake, Surya. Think again, Surya. As such your father-in-law is more expressive with his hand than with his tongue. - True. He hits hard. I am already very late. If I delay any further I will not get Sanjana back in my life. "Let our hearts come closer." Do you think he might have gone? Why not? I think by now Surya will be staring at Sanjana. Sanjana will be staring at her dad and her dad will be staring angrily at Surya and her dad will be staring angrily at Surya I didn't expect such silence. Sanjana, though I had a problem, I loved you sincerely. Once her dad hears this.. Didn't you read the headline I wrote in the crime column? The person who lied to his lover and cheated her was arrested. He won't stop with just reading the headline. Aruna, he is back. Come. Surya, did he push you out? Hey! Your shirt is crumpled. I did not expect him to be so crude, Aruna. These old hags never understand the youth, Surya. Youth? - What are you staring at? Going to her house and simply explaining won't help, Surya. In that case, let's all go together and explain. This idea somehow looks risky. If not at this age, when will you take a risk? It's true, but.. - Mr. Ersam. Come here. Boys, if I have to speak about my love strongly not only Sanjana, but many more should know. That's why I've decided to break the news on TV. That too, on live. Why make it public? Isn't it enough if Sanjana knows? - Hey, old man. The youth will do anything for friendship. As they say in English.. A friend in need.. - Is a friend indeed? That's a good quote. It's odd to refer to you as youth. Hey, we will do anything for Surya. - Yes. Thank you, guys. All of you came in support of me today. We will again prove that students are capable of anything. Yes.. How can you all be students? If we have to reach our target there are three tasks. Take one: Yes, how may I help you? Are you the audience? - Yes. - Okay. But why are you all here at this time? Hello, here's a special sweet Paan for you. It's from Zubair. You will love it. She will wake up only in the morning. Task two: Lift man. We've come to meet the creative head. What business do you have with Mr. Loha Raju? Get lost! Hey, I will handle it. Sir, this is a special Paan. Only for you. Take it. - Paan at this hour? Get lost. You are such an ignorant fool. I will give him a gift. It will shut him up. Take this chilled beer. Is it okay now? Okay, take us to the office directly. Task three: Convincing Loha Raju. Who are you guys? - Students.. In which serial? - To convince that adamant guy.. Let's give you him Paan with love. Loha Raju does not get impressed with a Paan. Okay, we will give him beer. It's chilled beer, sir. Is it okay now? Loha Raj cannot be bought with liquor. What else is left? Let's give him money. You cannot buy me with money either. Take it back.. If he does not succumb to any of these we will threaten him with a gun. Oh, sorry! Didn't you say that you are students? Loha Raju, he is definitely scared of guns. Oh my God! Guns? This is the gun used by an actor in a movie. Is it original? - It's a dummy. He should not know that it is a dummy. Do you think it is a dummy? It's original! - That's good cover up. W-What do you want? We want your studio for half an hour. Surya will declare his love for the girl in a live program. Oh! - What? Do you want me to shoot you down? Just say yes, Surya. - I will call and inform my CEO. Please.. I will lose my job. Okay, carry on. - Please.. Hello sir, to our Suraksh TV channel office a couple of them have come with gun, sir! - Hey, you! I am only informing him.. Where else, sir? At our Banjara Hills TV channel office. Oh, will you be here in five minutes, sir? Please come fast. Hey. I did not call my CEO. I called the police. Get out of this place in five minutes. You won't get arrested. Surya, Mr. Loha Raju has given us five minutes. Let's make use of this opportunity and vacate right away. Mr. Ersam, our faces have been recorded in the CCTV camera. We will be caught anyhow. We will surrender after I declare my love for Sanjana. Is that it? - Yes. Move fast! Take us to the studio room. Move, get in.. Surya.. since we have five minutes, after finishing your work I will sing a song, please.. Okay, Mr. Ersam. Let me finish my work first. We'll see. - Move! Lord Ram along with Sugreeva, Angada, Hanuman, Jambavan and his army, attacked Lanka. and his army, attacked Lanka. Ram who was pining for Sita built a bridge over the sea. While moving in with his army cruel demons tried to obstruct them on the way.. What's with the strange twist? He is not aware of the current situation. Let's take a break before the war. Praise, Lord Rama.. Surya, stand here. On air.. All that is okay, but do you think she will watch this programme? Sanjana, switch on your TV quickly. Surya is in our studio. It will work now. Come, ma'am.. - Hey, Shubha. Look at that. See what your son doing on TV! Surya? One minute has already passed. 'Start soon, pal!' Sanjana.. Few nights ago, I almost faced death. 'I thought of only two people at that time. My mom and you.' 'I thought of only two people at that time. My mom and you.' 'There's not much to convey to my mother.' She knows more about me than I do myself. 'Also, she's stubborn. She never listens to me.' The next is you. I tried several times to discuss my problem with you. I could not do it once because of the police guy. 'Another time at the cemetery, when you suddenly kissed me.' It was my first kiss! Oh, she did? Sanjana, you complain that I cannot be frank with you. 'But today, through this TV show, on live' in front of so many people, I am speaking courageously. 'There's only one reason. I love you..' 'I love you, Sanjana.' I have friends, family, cars, money. I have all of that in abundance. And yet, I feel empty. Something is missing. I am not complete. 'That's because you are missing.' I miss you. 'I know where I will be in the next ten minutes.' I will be in the police station. Once I am out, you know where I will wait for you. Mr. Ersam.. Shubha, bring me the phone. A lawyer is needed. A lawyer is needed. Switch off the TV. Does anyone talk about private matters on TV? Indecent fellow. Everyone who hides the truth has an alibi. You are not a kid. I don't like you meeting him. For the movie, 'Manchi Manishi' song sung by P.B. Sreenivas. Music by T. Chalapathi Rao. This old hag has started. "Oh, a rose like maiden." "Lovely garland of love." "The one with lovely eyes." "The one with a good heart." "Realise who your love is." "Realise it.." These are the guys, sir.. Arrest them, sir. - That's enough for now. Let's go to the station. - Arrest them immediately, sir. Sir.. We are students. - Please leave us, sir.. Hail, Lord Rama. Hail, Lord Rama. Sir.. Please leave me. Come to my ice cream kiosk every night, sir. I will give you ice cream, sir. - Why are you pushing, sir? Mr. Ersam, you sang very well. If I had more practice, Balu would been out of business. - Who? Hey, don't push me. I am a singer. - Oh, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam! Hey! Get in. Hey, stop. How did you all manage to enter into their office? I gave a Paan, sir. I gave beer, sir. I paid money, sir. I showed him a gun, sir. Whom did you give all these to? To Mr. Loha Raj.. Hey, when did you give all those to me? Why did you involve me? "Almighty! We are your people." - Superb! "This is our fate!" "Your introduction.." - Greetings, ma'am. Open the cell. - Yes, sir. Take your seat, sir. Surya, your mom is here. Thank God. This is nice! Liquor, feast, love, kiss, fight, etcetera.. You did all of that and finally landed in the police station. Superb. It's enough! If that girl accepts your love, it is okay. Or else, I will complete your studies and get into our business. - Ma'am, cold drink. Thank you. Hey, Mr. Ersam. Is this stupid idea yours? Can you correlate my age and this idea, ma'am? I don't know anything. Hey, get out.. Thank you. Do you think she will come? Do you think she will come? Or do we have to do more? Dad does not like me meeting you. But I ignored him and came here to meet you. Gifts are not given to leave them behind. I only left the goggles, Sanjana. I don't need them anyway. If I want to say something, I can express it to you. Okay. Tell me one thing. That day at the market when I told you that four guys were teasing me you said you will not come before 6:30 p.m. But you came immediately. Did you come because it rained? Or did it rain after you got there? I didn't have time to think about all that. I came outside for you. Okay, forget that. Go to Monda market at the same time tomorrow. Whether rain or sun if you ask me to come, I will be there. "There's no sea without waves and no eyes without dreams." "No sun devoid of light." "Who lives with a heart devoid of love?" I've applied for night shift. They will confirm in two days. Theory of God is very simple. If you accept yourself the world will accept you. Every human being has some problem. Can Surya never see the sun? I have too. But life has to go on. He has no need to see the sun. He is the sun for himself.
