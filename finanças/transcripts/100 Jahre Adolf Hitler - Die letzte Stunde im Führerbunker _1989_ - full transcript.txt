Schnapps, Wim, Trotta, Nico, GK . All of Germany is my homeland At the 40th Cannes film festival after getting the Golden Palm in 1984 for PARIS TEXAS, Wim Wenders got the director's prize for WINGS OF DESIRE. We can improve the pictures of this world and with that this world can be improved. (Silence!) Saint Martin, Saint Martin, your coat please spread, from home to home, for us to tread. Shelter all... Saint Martin, shelter all till life's not grim. For Ute, Volker Wim and Klausl "The time is up... Once more the seven years have past. With gaiety the ocean casts me up on land." Brother Borlein, this was Fegelein'. Brother Göring, what is it? This was Fegelein. - So what? We've been betrayed, betrayal is our fate. Help, help... Betrayal, betrayal... EDITORS: ASSISTANT DIRECTORS: MUSIC: PRODUCTION SUPERVISORS: Sister Braun, hurry up... something terrible has happened... I'm coming, Sister Goebbels, I'm coming... WRITER/DIRECTOR FÜHRER'S BUNKER, 5 pm Ever gently falls the snow, still and frozen is the lake. The woods shimmer in Christmas glow. Rejoice, Christ Child will soon awake. Pass me the salt, please. The salt? Yes you can have it...! Here! You swine! Such impertinence, I hate you, I hate you! What is it? What is it now? It's better, it's alright! Where is he? He's never on time. Since Stalingrad... he just stays in bed, drunk, and ignores meals. That's his way to celebrate, that's right... it's his way to celebrate. What do you mean he's celebrating? Millions are running into the knives of the Bolsheviks... and he is... celebrating. Brother Göring, you are so stupid. You should have been the Reich Chancellor. Do you mean that...? Really...? Attention, the Führer... The Führer. Fucking... yes“.yes“.yes“. I am still the greatest. Not just the leader and hero... I am myself! Straight, strong and simple! Only a few more minutes till the end. He has to hear about it. - Do you want to tell him? No, tell him what? - About Fegelein. Fucking... fucking... Swine, this German swine! A German swine. Betrayal, betrayal... What's going on? - Get a hold of yourself! Fegelein betrayed us. - Why did he betray us? He was found with a prostitute... with a prostitute. This is going too far. We cannot accept this... - It is against providence! Gifts... First powder the nose... Gifts... and this too. Now I have them all. Look here, Auntie Eva... Yes... Did you paint this? It is very beautiful. Uncle Hitler will get very jealous... Sign your name to it. (Quit there!) You swine! You swine! (Cut!) You swine! You swine! Psssst... The time has come. She must tell him. Her alone. Not now! Not now! Not now! Silent night, holy night, all is calm all is bright! 'Round you virgin, mother and child holy infant so tender and mild sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace. April... April... Attention, the Führer! You cunt... you miserable cunt, you miserable piece of... you bloody sod! Sister Morell I would like to... also in the name of the Führer... ask you very sincerely for forgiveness. Thank you. Fucking. The Child! The Child! But this is just the Holy Family. They will survive us all. Fucking... fucking... Brother Bowman, do you hear me'? I'm reading from the works of degenerated artists. Did you find anything out? I need to know... will I be Reich Chancellor? You won't advise against it? Did you get what I discussed with Goebbels? No, I didn't get it. The German people... the German people... Do you suppose that the German people... during the last 12 years... initiated intercourse on their own? And now I want to be Reich Chancellor. Say it now: I am the Führer. Hail Bormann! - Say: "I am the Führer!" All angels of this world deliver us from this Führer! You have to get up earlier... and that won't be so easy for you. I can't anymore. Help, help, help... I am really fainting. Blondie, in winter, birds fly south... c'mon, fly! Hey Göring. I've just been making pee-pee with Blondie. Asshole, asshole, asshole! Ah, here you are! Eveybody is talking about you, but nobody can tell me where you are. I want to do something good for you. This is Russian nut oil. It will keep the body strong... and restore its suppleness. And it is stimulating. As long as there are Bolsheviks, our future, the Third Reich, has a chance. An enemy can do wonders, wonderful wonders. Not the silent wonders... the hard ones... the hard ones... the hard ones! I love you so madly, so madly... My Fegelein... No, no I'll throw you down... I'll finish you! I'll finish you! I can't anymore! Go away... go away! Leave me alone! Mama, I'm afraid. Why is Auntie Eva screaming? All will be good. All will be good! "Hundreds of thousands think they think the same... hundreds of thousands learn to think the same..." Eveything will pass. There... there... how horrible... "On February 12th, the czarina died. The miracle of the House of Brandenburg had occurred." My poor little czarina... poor little ozarina! (Action) Betrayal... betrayal... betrayal... Come now, I have to talk to you. And now? - Now he will tell her. How awful. It's the end! - What's he telling her? You'll be Reichs Chancellor. Prepare for the worst. The end is near. The end? The end. Fegelein, a man of our rank was caught with a prostitute. Fantastic, it's marvelous, Hitler is finished once and for all... the Führer is finished. Before the worst happens, we must destroy ourselves. Never! What Fegelein did was an act of greatness. What you suggest is escape. - No. Self destruction is the only greatness in the hour of betrayal. You must die... my wife, my children, all must die! Never, no! Only one is allowed to die. He...! I have heard everything! Only one must die, only one alone. "As the great King himself can't see any way out and is at a loss about what to do as his generals and statesmen are sure of his defeat, as the enemies already foresee the fall of Prussia and the future lies grey and dark in front of him he writes to Finkenstein, his cabinet secretary, about a grace period he gave himself: If by February 15th no changes takes place, he will give up, he will take poison. Carlyle writes further: Brave King, wait a little longer, the days of your suffering will then be over, clouds will part and fortune will show itself." Honorable Mr. Himmler, herewith I inform you that I am planning to close my press office. I ask you to end those flight experiments which used excellent non-Germans. If we made a mistake, it was only using foreigners in the experiments and never Germans. Blondie... here... only for you. These days, this is eaten by all dogs and all Führer. You'll be strong and survive. Then a small section will penetrate the revolution. A part of the grand inner dialogue will fall. As a result of the emerging feebleness, only the deep inner emptiness, the longing for expression and strength, the longing for sentimental and melancholic images will be left. Papa“. Dead, definitely dead... my Blondie, sleep well! I will send my useless children into death and wait for the newborn, who rests in my wife's womb and will be born any minute now. With the elimination of the Bourgeois demands, we have thrown Faust off his pedestal and created a base for the human race. With balance, it will creep slowly into the future. It is a human race, that, in our sense, will still be satisfied and self-destructive! Now, we no longer need a dictator, just the German people! We don't need a dictator, just the German people! I would like to conclude by saying the people won't be longing for a Führer, only the artist who has to learn not to resign, but to use the limits around him. Because, and I'm sure you will agree with me, Hitler, too was an artist! When I'm Reich Chancellor, I will lean on both of you. Fegelein, you'll do my foreign politics and brother Bormann, you'll do my domestic politics. I'll take care of propaganda, and we will oust Goebbels. Take care of what? Of film and art and the art of hunting, and museums... I'll take care of collecting museums. So you are the substructure, I am the superstructure. I think this is the best way to regulate the future distribution of power. You do the real power, I do the unreal power. That way we'll build a 3,000 year empire. If it continues like this, Göring, you can forget becoming Reich Chancellor. Because there will be a Reich Chancelloresse. You think she told him already? I cannot! Two blond women stand in front of a monkey cage. Suddenly a monkey pulls one of them through the bars and fucks her to death. Bones, ribs, legs broken, one eye is missing. Fegelein, don't let your fantasy run rampant. Totally wrecked in the ass. At the hospital, when her friend asks "How are you?", she replies "Terrible, terrible!" "Why terrible... you're already so much better." "But... he doesn't write, he doesn't phone." Damn shit, stop it already. What do you want? I want to console you, I want to help you. Do you have something? - It's the last I could find. Morphine. Taste's good... like nuts. Like nuts... walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, any kind. Enjoy them, the nuts of the Germans. Give my greetings to sister Morell! Stop screaming... stop it. Get up, Comrades. What was that? - My God. What was that? What was that? The Führer... the Führer... he is dead... I am Reich Chancellor! I... l... l... Hail my Führer! I am Reich Chancellor! Fucking Eva... hail Eva, hail my Führer... hail, hail! Betrayal, betrayal, betrayal! Shut up, be quiet! But this is Eva! This is the Führer, hail, hail! Your wife is right. The moustache is false. See what you have done, see. I've had enough. Nobody move. Hey, Göring, don't be a fool. Shut up! I should have stayed in Berchtesgaden. Hermann, stop this nonsense. - Never. I will be Reich Chancellor or nothing. Without the Führer, you'll never be Reich Chancellor. The Führer is dead... dead. Ah, yes? And who is in there? I don't know. The Führer is dead. Normally, how does one recognize the Führer? By his moustache. Who has a moustache now? The Führer... So you see? - I understand. Hail my Führer, hail, hail! Fuck... God helps those who help themselves. Isn't that Strauss? Yes, exactly. The calamity of this war is, on one hand it began too early for Germany, but on the other hand, much too late. Militarily the war came one year too late, morally, it came 20 years too early. The drama for the Germans is never having enough time. And if we don't have time, it is mostly because we have no room. The Russians, with their enormously vast land, can afford the luxury of not being crowded. Time works for them but it works against us! We have to organize and arrange ourselves, even though, and I say this openly, we have the right to freely develop and unfold. Can you hear me? This is Hitler speaking from the Fiührer's bunker. Send all armies to the east, west and south. Field Marshall Rommel should come back. We need him for Russia. I ask you... in the ranks of my immediate successors, will there be a chosen one to carry the torch? Oh, people, so unstable, so erratic as no other people, where are you? Germany, Germany, above everything, above everything... And...? Marriage! What? Marriage! Marry, marry. Always affirmative, dear Josef. I'm all for it, marry... And whom? Eva, whom do you want to marry? You! Hail, the Führer has spoken. Margarethe, my dear Wim, Hans my darling. When I take a sober and unsentimental look I have to admit, my friendship with you, my dear children, can be allotted to the list of my many mistakes. You have inhibited me everywhere and... you will inhibit Germany in the future. If you behave quietly and with self-incrimination they will be grateful and respect you, but then, they will criticize and simply dismiss you, and later they will ridicule you. It would truly be a mistake... to think you're equal, because you're not equal. You will retreat... and forget your past or obstinately deny it. Your charm, your body will save you, your fuzz, your smoothness... like a dove without talons, they'll respect you for the sake of peace. You're lost, little man. Come now, please. The children? The children are asleep, deeply and soundly. Quickly, Göring, let's beat it! Not at this moment. That goes against my belief as a German officer. But it will finish itself. - Nothing finishes itself. The old one is crazy... Hitler is dead, Braun can't handle this... What do you still want? Are you against any Führer? My Führer'is dead, yours is down there, but can't handle it. You're shameless...! Come down here, now. (Action) Honorable guests, we gather together to sanctify this marriage. In the presence of witnesses I ask you, my Führer, are you willing to take the vow of marriage with Martha Goebbels? Yes, I am. I ask you, Martha Goebbels are you willing to take the vow of marriage with my Führer? I ask you again! Martha Goebbels, are you willing to take the vow of marriage with my Führer? Honorable guests, I declare the marriage as lawful and legal. She is dead! No!No!No! The child, the child. Take her away! What are you doing, Göring? A little bit of cyanide. It would be a pity if this didn't look like she took her own life. My soul can't stand this. I'm getting out of here. We must burn her. It is done! I've had enough now. I'm leaving. Let me go, get away from me! We will never get away from you. I am resigning. You are a German dog. A German dog has to burn. A symbol for all the people in Germany, who, daily, hope for deliverance. A symbol among many symbols. Farewell! We can improve the pictures of this world and with that this world can be improved. The Germans have always shown their greatest skill in times of hardship, hunger and war. If you don't apply political values, the achievements of the Germans during and after both wars, were enormous, inconceivable. Hats off to such achievements. (Very emotional, very powerful) My little Moses. For all the critics in the world who still haven't understood it... A symbol... Actually the Germans are romantic people, but then they start pondering. Others are logical, but in the practical sphere, they're more realistic. Germans must finally learn... not everything in life ends in a mathematical parable, like 2 x 2 - 4. They should be less romantic, less enchanted, and most of all less ideological! Let go of me! You are crushing me. What came over you? Yes, that's better! So, that was it.
