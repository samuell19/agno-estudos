- Beautiful weather we're having. - I could stay like this forever. - I could stay with you forever. Whoa! Come on, come on! Whoa, whoa! I got you! Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you all right? I'm everything you'll never be. - Good morning. - I would like to know where the Donner file is, I need it in 10 minutes for a meeting. (Margaret yelling Do you have the file or don't you? Well, you gave it to me just yesterday, it's not ready yet. - What have you been doing all this time? - I've gotta get the budget done for next quarter and if I don't get that in by two p.m. we won't cover materials or supplies. - Look, mister, you get this right, my priorities are your priorities. You are to drop whatever you're doing and take on my projects first. - But if the budget doesn't get in... - Ah! I'm about to go into that meeting without that file. This is not going to look good for me, and you! We're going to have a conversation about this later, mister. This is going to affect your future. - Nothin', okay? All of sudden she's like, "'Kay, stop, stop, stop!" - What up, dog? Biatch on the warpath again? - I guess. - You know you let people walk all over you. You know you shouldn't do that. You are such a push over. - You think? - Hey, I'm gonna call you back. Yo, she looks like a major league ice queen. - What, man? - Oh, no, no I bet I can melt those defenses. - You ain't the player with moves. - Oh. - Ah. - All right, Georgie. Oh, suddenly you know all about the moves now, right? Man, you'd hit that any day! - First of all, y'all don't know shit. - Look fellas, fellas, fellas all right. You know what? Watch the master, after all I am the chief negotiator for this company. - All right, let's see it. - Play ball. Five bucks. - Mm-hmm. - Looks like we made a connection. - I would've let you stare a little longer if you kept your mouth shut. - Come on let's, uh, reboot this conversation. I'm Derrick Rogers, I work in legal. - I'd rather finish my lunch. - Come on. Look, I'm not asking for your hand in marriage. - Do you wanna get to know me? - You just struck out, bro! - What the hell are you two laughin' at, huh? You oughta take a good look in the mirror. I make more money than the two of you put together... How about that? You're nothing but a little worm, you little piece of shit! - Everything seems to be going well, Cyril. So what happened in the lunchroom today? - I didn't do anything! That, that jerk from legal, he's the one who started it. - We'll forward this incident to Derrick's manager, but right now we need to deal with your behavior. - Your file is dotted with many troubling things. - I know I've messed up but I had to learn everything for myself, I wasn't shown what to do! - You give me no choice but to place you on a performance plan. I'll be watching you closely. So you better bring your work up to an acceptable level. - I don't wanna sign it. - I think it would be a good idea if you did. Thank you. This will affect your future. You're nothin' but a little worm, you little piece of shit! Your file is dotted with many troubling things. You should kill them all. They're only worm food, wasting space for all of us here. - Who's that? It's me. - Me? Me who? I'm what you really are. - I've finally cracked. I'm talking to voices in my... I'm a lot closer than you think. - Hi, honey, how ya doin'? - Want a flower? - Ugh! - Where you going in such a hurry? - I'm just trying to get out of the rain and get home. - Oh yeah? I see. Well, this here is my alley, and everyone around here knows it, so if you're gonna come through my alley, you're gonna pay some respect! - I'll just go back the way I came. - Too late! Now you're gonna have to pay the toll. Come here! Open up. There you go, swallow that. Right, baby, you're gonna pay, right? Now get the hell out of my alley! Beat it! - Oh, hey, Cyril. Oh, hey, Callie. - I thought you were Todd. - Nope. No, it's just me. - I, um, do you think you could help me with something? - Yeah, sure, what's up? - Are, are you okay? - Ugh, I had a long day, I'm pretty tired. - Maybe you should lie down or something. - Good idea. - Okay. - I feel pretty sick. - Let me know if you need anything! - Hello? Yo, baby. Oh yeah? I can come over and take care of that right now. Oh yeah, you know I can take care of that, baby. Come over and get a little nasty, huh? Ooh baby! You are just one nasty little girl! That's what I like about you. So wear that little red number, okay? That's right. That's what I like about you. What do you want? Isn't it a little early for Halloween? Don't you know who I am? I can have you killed! - There can't be two death dealers. There can be only one! - Your thighs needs some serious fucking help, babe. - Baby... - You're one inch from lookin' like a hippo! I got an image to keep up here. - Hey, Cyril, you feeling any better? Yeah. - If you're gonna party with me, you gotta keep up. So stop being so mousey. - Hey! You need to treat her like a lady. - You talkin' to me, shrimp? - I'm not talking to anybody else. - You gotta be kiddin' me! - Todd, come on! He's a nice guy, - Mind your own business! - he's my neighbor! - Hey! Todd! - Later, losers. - I am so sorry. He's not usually like that, he's just mad 'cause I'm slacking on my gym workout. - Yeah, that's great, I'd hate to see him on a bad day. - There's something different about you. - Really? I gotta go to work. - Okay. I'll see you later? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - No! No, no, no, don't touch, don't touch it. Put it down, just, just put it down. Just go, just go. - I'm sorry. - Crazy shit. - It's like straight out of a comic book. - Yeah, but this was real, someone was actually crazy enough to do it. - That's the world we live in today. - No doubt. - At least it happened to some scumbag. - You don't think it was some vigilante? - It was probably some psycho. - What's up? - Here's the paper, read it yourself. - Good morning. - Good morning. - I'm so sorry about getting you mixed up in all that yesterday. I hope nothing bad happened. - No, no, it's okay, it's nothing I can't handle. - I'm Elisa. - I'm Cyril. - So what's the story around here? And what's up with those guys? - There you are, I've been looking all over for you. - My boss. - Oh. I should probably get going. - Okay, I'll see you later. - So, now you have two friends. Working hard? - Who the fuck is that? I'm what you hold back. - What're you talking about? I don't hold anything back! I do exactly what I want to. Oh, so you're dating that girl across the hall, telling your boss off, and what about that drug dealer? - That drug dealer's dead. Yeah, I know. And didn't that make you feel better? - A little, I guess. Well, I can make you feel a whole lot better. - How? You're just a voice in my head. Believe in me and I will deliver you from your hell on Earth, give you everything that you desire. I can give you any girl that you want! Hey, how about a raise, huh? No, no, better yet! I can wreak vengeance upon those who have offended you. - Yes. Oh yeah. I will make those people pay for what they've done to you. - I believe in you. Wise choice. Stick around, I'll be right back! - I had a great day. So I got that little worm to take on all my workload. And the best part is, I'll fire him when he doesn't come through! Yeah, well, he's a total disaster and he's bringing down my department. Whose side are you on, anyway? Look, Tom, you better get on board for the future. You know, I got a lot planned! Where we're going to live, where you should be in your career, how many kids we're going to have. You know I... Something just fell in the kitchen. Hang on, I'll be right back. Hm. Well, it looks like I just... Oh, asshole, how dare you hang up on me! What the hell now? Hello? - Oh my, you've fallen and you can't get up! - What do you want? - How does it feel to be the one being stepped on? Oh, your files are dotted with troubling things. How about some origami, huh? Don't you just hate paper cuts? Lemons. And now, for the piece de resistance. I would love and stay and have play time, but I have others to see and miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep! And scene. Damn, that was good. - Dude, you'll never believe what happened last night! - Must be somethin' big, everyone's on alert. - I'll say! Your boss bit the dust last night. - What do you mean, she was fired? - You didn't hear the news? - No, um... I, uh, I came in early, I didn't hear any news. - Somebody killed Margaret last night. - What? - Yeah, they said it was some bizarre thing involving files and paper cuts and a... - Congrats on the promo. - What? - Look, I think you're perfect to take over her gig. A go nowhere position for a go nowhere guy. Look, I wanted to see her dead, too. I mean, who didn't around here? You more than anybody here. God, she was a real bitch! - Who's a real bitch? - Why don't you ask Cyril here? He's an expert on that. - You are? - Derrick Rogers, I work in the legal department. - Well, I may need to ask you some questions, don't go too far. - Later, gator! - Cyril Bass. - Yes. - You worked with Margaret Chase? - I worked for her, she was my boss. - Did you get along with her? - Sure. - Did she ever talk about anybody she was having a problem with? - She, she had a boyfriend. - She put you on a performance plan to keep you on probation. How'd that make you feel? - I guess she felt I wasn't doing my job. - I might have some more questions for you. Please. Give me a call if you can think of anything. - I will. - What's up? - Hi. - Bitches, man! What're you gonna do? - Right. - They make you do shit that you don't do. - Whatever you say, man. - That's right! Whatever I say. - I really thought he was different, you know? That he had this tough exterior but underneath it he was sensitive. - You never know what lies just beneath the surface. I mean, I, I know I'm still finding out who I am. You're a sweetheart, you can't change that. Hey, I got a dark side. I'm not all prim and proper. Hey, just 'cause I was in the Boy Scouts doesn't mean I can't change a little. - Girls never settle with the bad boys, they settle with the good guys. They just wanna play with the bad boys. - But the bad boys always hurt you. You could've had her! She was ready, man! - Shut up, asshole! Asshole? Cyril, I am the champion of your cause! I make all your nightmares go away! - You are my nightmare! Oh, man, that hurts! Hey, what should we do about ol' Todd, huh? - We're not gonna do shit! Yeah, sure, why should we do anything that could bring you closer to Callie, huh? - Okay. I'm not opposed to teaching him a lesson, but do you have to kill people? Man, I just get carried away. You know how that is? I mean, one minute you're slappin' 'em around and the next you cut their throats. - You see, I don't know if I can trust you. All right, Cyril, I promise I will be good. I mean, after all, I'm a part of you. - Okay. You're just gonna teach him a lesson, right? Right! - You think I actually have a chance with Callie? We settle with good guys! You remember that? I mean, even you could get a girl like that! - Hey, easy! Yeah, easy! Do you believe in me? - Yes. Let's do this. Ha ha, thank you! Thank you so much! - Who doesn't want some of this? I know plenty of girl who'll want some. And do! Yeah! Oh my God, are those stretchmarks? - What? Where? Oh yeah. Let's get a double bicep. Nice, but you got nothin' on this! - Check this out! - Yo, what about this? - That's nothin'! - Whoa, very nice! - Thank you! - How ya doin'? Hey. You don't seem very big now, do ya, Todd? Bigger, better, stronger! Come on, Todd! How's it feel to have somebody fight back, huh? Whoa, nice! Get the point? I am the governator of your pain. Cyril, open the door, it's Callie, I have to talk to you! - What the... Oh, shit! Uh, hang on, I'll be right there! Hang on! I just got a call from the police and they said that Todd was killed last night while working out and I turn on the TV and it appears to be a freak accident! Oh! - I really thought that we could make things work. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm sorry, I'm confused right now. I guess I got carried away. You're so nice. I like you. - You should probably get going. - Bye. - I'll see ya. You promised you were only gonna teach him a lesson! Did you like kissing her? - What? I think she liked kissing you very much. - You promised. - Hey, it was outta my control. I mean, I tried talkin' to the guy, but he just took it to a whole different level. Hey, wasn't it nice bein' the hero? Her hero? And now you're the big boss at work. I think I delivered on my promises. - Bass. - Hey! Cyril Bass. Cyril Bass. Mr. Bass here. No. No. No! Yes. You know what? You're fired! You need to bring your work up to an acceptable level. - Hey there! - Yo. - You seem to fit right in. - Well, I was doin' all the work anyway and it's not like it's brain surgery. Well, I thought you would like to go grab some lunch to celebrate your new position. - Yeah. Yeah, I could use a break. - Here you go, ma'am. For you, sir. I'll be right back. - Thanks. - You seem different. - How do you mean? - More confident. Not the same Cyril I met the other day. What happened? - I guess I woke up, you know? Spiritually. In this crazy world crazy things can happen. If you don't get yourself together, you're gonna be sucked down the drain and washed out to sea. What's the word? - Just havin' a little lunch. - What're you doing here? - What? I can't eat? Me and the fellas have a usual Thursday thing here. We saw you guys come in, I thought I'd come by and say hi. - Bye! - Well, I'm actually here to talk to my man Cyril. How would you like to go out with me and the fellas tomorrow night? A little party, a little drinky, huh? Should be a real good time. - Really? Yeah, sure, sounds like fun. - All right, I'll drop you a little email, let you know what's up, all right? - Are you really gonna go out with those guys? - I'm on an equal playing field with them now. They know I'm the big dog, they wanna hang with the man on the way up. - Who are you and what have you done to Cyril? You're definitely not the same guy I met. - I'd like to think that that Cyril won't be bothering us anymore. I have to move on. - Gentlemen, welcome to the big time. Huh, huh? Ah, my home away from home, my little happy place, the soft spot in my heart. - Hey get us some beers, baby. - Oh, hey, who's this? Say hello, say hello! - It's okay! - We'll talk later, huh? Okay? It's all good, it's all... What do we have here, huh? China, China! You, you, yeah! Hot! I love her, she's fantastic! Woo! Yeah! All right!

So, what's it like being my boss? - It's cool. - You know, I should buy you a drink. - Okay. - No. No, no, not a good idea.

Yeah, well, I'm tired of bein' around a pussy like you! - I didn't give you permission to come out! I'm not askin' permission! - Oh no you don't! - I've given you everything and this is how you repay me? - I didn't want any of this, not this way! - You can't keep me in! - I'm not letting you loose on this world! - I have more in common with this world than you do! You have such a simplistic idea of what this world is all about, but that's not how it works out here. I have shown you the darkness which resides in everyone, inside yourself, Cyril! And by using this, you have gained status, closure, everything you ever dreamed of. What is wrong about that, huh? - Civility. Morals. Ethics. - Bullshit. It's all overrated. - I command you to come back here! - Command? Command, you command me? Did you really believe you had any control over me? I only let you think that because that's the only way you would buy into all of this. You're a loser. - Come back here! Come back here! - Shit! - I mean, could you believe that kid pussed out? Jesus! - Hey, Derrick, whatever, man, no skin off my nose, right? - Shit, I knew he wasn't ready for the big time! - Fuck it, let's bounce before I spend my retirement here! - Are you fuckin' serious? - I'm out! - She made me... - Dude, don't drive too drunk, get in the car. - Fuck you! - Eat it! - What the fuck? Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Fuckin' cat! Jeez. - Can you believe that dude? - Hey, come on, man, it's not like the night was a total loss, right? - Where did you get those? - Well, let's just say that Amber took a shine to me and gave me what I wanted. - You're full of it man, give me this! - Hey, man, what're you doing, man? You're gonna rip it, dude! - You all right? - Ugh! Ugh! - You'll live. - Fuck you! - What did we hit anyway? - Time to pay the piper, man! Georgie Porgie! Georgie! Are ya hot, Georgie boy? Does me butt look big, Sam? So you wanna role play, huh? Giddy up, horsie, giddy up! What's wrong, didn't you like my dancing? - Mommy! - You can't touch the dancers but we can touch you! - Good evening. - Hey. - What happened to you? - I kinda had an accident. Can I get into my apartment? - Sure. You're probably wondering why I'm here. Um, no. - It's because of this rash of bizarre murders that we've had. You know... You live across the hall from the girlfriend of one of the victims and you worked with one of the other ones. And that drug dealer? He was killed not to far from here. So there seems to be a lot of coincidences that have a common ingredient. - What's that? - You. - Me? What makes you think I could hurt a fly? - You're saying you're not capable of murder? - I guess anything's possible, I'm just saying I wouldn't hurt a fly, much less a person. - All this is conjecture, of course. Circumstantial evidence, at best. But it all looks too suspicious, don't you think? Yeah? When? Okay, I'll be right there. God damn it! It seems there's been another bizarre murder on the other side of town. Too far from here. - Hey. - What do you want? - I'm sorry about last night, I just couldn't get into it. I'm not like you guys in that way. - You? That's all you can think about is you? What about Georgie and Sam? How about thinking about them? - What about Georgie and Sam? They got home okay, didn't they? - No, they were killed last night, as part of this whole murder spree that's been happening. So that's what's happened to them. Why don't you get the fuck out of your little hole and try thinking about somebody else for once! - I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. - What? - If I hadn't have let him out none of this would've ever happened. Fuck! I guess you reap what you sow. - What the fuck are you goin' on about? Do you know who's been doin' this shit? - You pushed me and you pushed me and you treated me like some kind of human trash bin! What was the result you were all hoping for? How did you think I would handle all that abuse? I couldn't stay quiet forever! - You! - You're dead. So you're next. - Cyril Bass. You need to come with us! Cuff him. You have the right to remain silent. Get him! God damn it! - Cyril? Cyril, your door was open. Cyril, is that you? Cyril, what's wrong? Everybody's after me. They think I'm the one who killed all those people. - What're you talking about? - This cop, he came into my work and he tried to arrest me in front of everybody. - Why would anybody think you're a killer? - My boss, your boyfriend, my coworkers, that drug dealer down the street. - They're all just coincidences. You couldn't hurt a fly, I know you! I'll tell them that, I'll tell them how sweet and kind you are with me. They wouldn't believe you! - What makes you say that? - Because I did kill all of them. What, so now you're not gonna vouch for me, huh? - What are you? - Someone you know very well. - I know a lot of people but I've never seen anything like you! - I got a dark side, you know. I'm not all prim and proper. I mean, just because I was in the Boy Scouts doesn't mean I can't change a little. Oh, she just falls in the arms of any man. I don't know if this is gonna work out for ol' Cyril. Tramp! Hey. - I don't know what you're doing but if what they're saying is true you better stay away! - Okay, wait, wait, wait, I can explain! - Start talking, fast! - It all started three days ago. So the creature will go for Derrick next. And it will be tonight. Listen, I need your help to change this. I need your help to save him. To save me. - Hello? - Hey, it's Elisa. - Oh, hello, what's up? - Well, I heard what happened in the hallway today and I just wanna check, see if you needed anything. - No, I'm all right, I'm just watchin' the game, hangin' out in my jammies. - In your jammies, huh? So you're sure you don't need anything? - Well, I mean, I am alone, a little company wouldn't be so bad. - What, me over there? - Despite what you may think, I really am a gentlemen so... - Hmm. I don't know. - You know, just, just come over and hang out for a little bit. You know, you can take off whenever you want. I just need to know that there are some things in this world still, you know, real. - You're lucky I'm feeling maternal today. What's you address? - Hello! What the fuck is he doin' here? Don't try anything, the cops are right downstairs! - How useful was that, really? I made it up here. - God, I can't believe you. Are you apart of this, too? - No! I mean, I am now but there's something you need to hear. Just show him your back. - So you see, I am responsible, but I never had any control over what's going on. - What, am I just supposed to believe you? I mean, your fucked up back could be some weird birth defect - Oh, come on! - or, or something! Shit! - If Cyril was the killer, he would've done away with both of us by now. - How do you know he still won't? - Because I'm not a killer! I know that deep down inside I had thoughts of hurting people because of the way I was treated, but I was taught to respect life. I came to understand that human nature can be cruel. So I took those thoughts and I packed 'em in. They've decided they didn't wanna be contained anymore. I never had any control. - Freeze, Bass, don't move! You I didn't expect. - What the fuck took you so long? - I guess this should close the case then, huh? I knew it couldn't be only one killer. - Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, I didn't have anything to do with the killings! - Yeah, I'll see about that. - Don't answer that. - Shut up, all right, I'm had enough of your freaky shit! Who is it? Police, neighbor called us about a scream. Is everything okay in there? Nothin' like a little extra back up! - Oh fuck! - Hello, Derrick! Hold, hold it right there! - Kill him! - No! - I think you got him. I think that's police brutality. I want my lawyer, piggy piggy! - Help me! - Where do you think you're goin'? - We're leaving and you're not stopping us. - What makes you think you can do that? - Inside you're still connected to me. If I say that I have no more bad intentions towards Derrick, you have to stop. - I feel as you do. But I do everything that you can't go through with. - We're leaving and I'm going through with that. - Oh, I don't think so. What the hell? - This is a place where you can be yourself, where you don't have to lie or hide from those true feelings. - In the dream! - What is it that you want from all this? - I'm not sure. - That's not good enough. - What're you doing with them? - What do you want to do with them? - I don't want them here! I want them back where they belong! - What rewards do you wish when you give of yourself such? - Can you just speak in English, please? - You think these people really care about you? - Why does it matter what they think? I like myself! That's what's really important! - Oh, really? - I was so close to kicking your ass right outta there! It would've been so sweet. I was never going to let you get anywhere in the company, no way! - Come on, the only way that you could possibly get to Callie! Normally, she wouldn't even give you a second glance. In the end, it's the package that counts! - Shut up! - Dude, you had somebody else do you dirty work for you! You can't even express your feelings, you emotional retard! - You little motherfucker! I gave you a taste of the life you could've never had! You didn't have to kill me if you didn't like it! - I have nothing to say to you. No, no! - We're part of each other, Cyril, we're the same! You are. That's the real you! - You made me this way! - No, I just opened up the door. So what do you wanna do with 'em? - Let it course through your body, Cyril. Let it take hold! One more, Cyril. - Cyril! What's going on? - No! I'm the boss of me! You know what I like most about that door you opened? I can close it any time I want to. - Help! Help! Help! - I got you, dude! - I got it! - You all right? I feel okay. Easy! - What next? - Live your life, man. Consider yourself lucky you got a chance to correct a mistake. - Yeah, I got some things to think about. - How do we explain all of this? - Hell if I know. - Derrick, you're the law guy. What do you propose to do? - It's gonna take some time. - Hey. So you're outta here, huh? - Yeah. Hey, man, I'm really sorry about before. - It's okay. I knew you were possessed that night anyway.
