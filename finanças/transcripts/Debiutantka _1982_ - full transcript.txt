DEBUTANTE - Hello. - Hello. I’m from the architect’s office, a room was booked here for me from today. I don’t know anything about it. Can you check? My name is Orzechowska. Yes, indeed. Here we have it. Here. - The corridor behind the phone booth. - Thank you. Miss Orzechowska? I think there was a phone call for you just now. Do you know if it was from the office? - No, I don’t. - Thank you. Miss Orzechowska! A call for you. - Where is the phone? - Here, in the booth. Orzechowska, hello? How did it happen? No. I only just arrived at the hotel. No, I haven’t changed my mind. Why should I? Yes, I’m listening. Do you think that few hours of travelling would cause me to change my decision, which I made consciously? Marek, we’ve cleared all that. You know that I don’t care about money. You know I want to be here now. To work with a person that is clean. To learn something. We've agreed it all, right? Marek, this is not breaking off. You’ll be back in a year. Everything will be as usual, right? Look, I’m very tired. I’m going to the office. I’ll call you, once I had a look around. Yes? All right, bye. And now our colleague will take the floor… - Miss Orzechowska? - Hello. I'm sorry you had to wait. No, I'm sorry to bother you. Actually, I only know your name. I know that you will work with us... - Let’s go. - Thank you. Ladies and Gentlemen, the work in our studio is not coordinated. It’s not possible for the studio to work so randomly. Nobody knows why... You know that somebody resigned from this post? Yes. I know. His assistant, Ania, fell ill suddenly and had to leave. I know. Do you know the boss? No, how? I don't know him personally, but I’m aware of his work. I know all his projects, mainly those he did abroad. That's good. I think it should be all right. Only, I’d like to start working right away, if it’s possible. Just a moment. - Marysia? - Wait a minute. So, what? It’s two copies... When will Jerzy come to see us? He just left. He wanted to see you as well. This is Miss Orzechowska. She arrived from Warsaw this morning. She’s very eager to start working. Hello. Orzechowska Ewa. The winner of the Skrypij Award? Actually, I got the award together with my colleague. We worked together on the project. And you gave up a trip to France to work on our project? Apparently, I found this more important for me right now. Could I see the project and get to work right away? There is nothing happening here as yet. We are waiting for the order. Well… there is a spare drawing board. I’ll talk to the boss. If we need you, we’ll call you. She’s sharp. He is even sharper. - I don't know if you are aware of that? - He is allowed to be. A man who has nothing to hide has the right to be sharp. Have a look around. I must go to a meeting. If you want to, we could go to the site tomorrow. Jerzy promised that he’ll be there at 11 a.m. Of course. Yes. - Is that right? - I don't know if that’s right. Is it right that a maritime museum will be built here, while my family, we have no place to live and we are crowded into one room? You see, I don't know if there will ever be order in this country, if people like you will are breaking the law. The law… I wasn’t the first one to break it. This freak has been here for six months. But that’s of no importance. There is a more important issue. They gave us this location when he was building here already. Jerzy was delighted that it’s right by the sea. But now they are saying that the investment is too expensive, that we can't afford it now. Well, and this location. This area has been taken away from the shipyard. And what does he say to that? He is not aware of it. He always did only what he wanted. He never went for any deal or any compromise. I remember when he came back to Poland. He thought he could build a great housing estate here. But when he realized that it was just a pipe dream he simply said that he is getting out of it. This museum has been on his mind for many years. The project was to be implemented several times, then it was postponed. And how do you feel about that? I don’t understand. I’m just asking what you think about it? You must have some views on this matter. Personal ones. I’m only a technician. Aha. He didn’t come. Can you give me his phone number? He has no phone. All instructions for the studio go always through Maria. But I can’t sit here, doing nothing. I came here to work. I have to see him at least. You have the address. Try to go and see him. Although I wouldn’t advise you. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm off to work. I’m glad. Except that there is too many steps in the stairway, they are too low. Look. It's great that you brought it. Thank you very much. Excuse me, who is that outside the window? That’s his wife. She’s probably come for the money. Excuse me! I’m sorry, my name is Ewa Orzechowska. I am your husband's assistant. - Can you help me? - I don’t know anything. You see, it’s my second week here, but there is nothing happening. But I really don't know anything. - But if... - Excuse me. Bozena, Jerzy asked you to come back home immediately. Besides, you were to queue for butter, weren’t you? Well. One more thing. The boss was here yesterday, but you decided to go on an excursion with Engineer Radecki. But I... Wait a minute, I went because he was supposed to be there. Besides, he never opens for anyone, when he’s working. Miss Orzechowska! Miss Orzechowska! Phone call! - I’m sorry. I thought it was for me. - Thank you. Orzechowska speaking. Hello? Hello? Good evening, Mrs Maria. Are you sure he wants to see me? Of course, I can. Yes. Yes. I’ll try to be there as soon as possible. I’ll take a taxi. All right. I’ll be half an hour. Thank you. Goodbye. Good evening. Good evening. Don't be surprised I live here, too. Please, come in. Jerzy? Good evening. I just wanted to thank you that you’ve agreed to take me along to work. This is Ewa Orzechowska. Exactly. - I’d like to... - Please, come in. Jerzy... ...was waiting for you. Thank you for coming. There are few people nowadays who want to do something. Maybe you can tell us what's going on in the Duchy of Warsaw? As you know, the Duchy has fallen recently. They are sitting there, happy with themselves. Happy with their talents. This is actually one big shit. It's not even art anymore ... ...but concessions and trading, and money, money! Do you know why I gave up lecturing? Because I came to the conclusion that the people I teach… will be corrupted by reality anyway. Among my students, I have not met ... one who would be strong enough, to resist it. You must be right. Although I’m convinced that there are many people who think differently; who still care about something. There is no one. It’s not true. It merely seems so. There are such people, for sure. Now everything is changing. Yes, yes… Everything is changing. So, they will serve somebody else. You have no right to say that. It's really not the same. You didn’t understand me. I am not against what happened. Anyhow, I couldn't be against it with my biography. No. This is about something else. You see... If... ... if you want to do something real in your life, you must have something permanent. And that permanent thing... ...could only be our work. Politics should be left to other people. Will you have some whiskey? With pleasure. And you? Maybe I would like a drink, too. Get out. Maria doesn’t drink at all. The last train for Gdansk leaves in 20 minutes. Yes. You may want to see the project. Everything is ready, we just have to wait for that bloody order. Can we give her one copy? It's been prepared for a long time. We’ll talk tomorrow. Let's see whether you are capable of anything. Tomorrow. At the same time. At 10.00 pm? At 10.00 pm. Thank you. I’ll be here for sure. Bye. Good night. Excuse me… Bozena. Right, Bozena. I’m so sorry. Actually, I don’t know what this is all about, but I feel as if it was my fault. No. Nothing happened. I’m sorry. There are spaces left between the walls. Maria is a good architect, right? Very. And why doesn't she do anything? Why doesn’t she design something? She had many occasions, but she never wanted to do anything on her own. Why? After 20 years of work in one position, you can get complexes. Let’s go. I think it’s starting. Yes. I’ll call you. Has she always lived in this house? No. Apparently, she’s got a flat. Now and again she goes to her sister´s. But he rarely lets her go. - Isn’t it strange, that she never... - Ewa? Yes? Jerzy asked you to come earlier today. Yes. Of course. I'll come as soon as the meeting is over. I thought you came here to work, not to rally round. And you should have a good sleep before the evening. Don’t worry about me. I’ll keep up. Excuse me. Of course, the design is great, but I have a suggestion, that this white marble… - use a red brick instead. It will be lighter then. Anyway, that’s how they build today all over the world. It will be rougher, which will allow us to refer to the surroundings, to this old fortress. I think that’s very important. Then the whole metalwork, these window frames, will allow us to integrate this fortress into the whole project. This white marble is Jerzy’s main material idea. Try to understand it. It’s supposed to be a compact solid block. Torn in two directions: towards the land and towards the sea. I understand that. Only the brick does not interfere with this. It only takes away the stiffness and this unnecessary monumentality. My child, have you ... Have you ever heard of the scale of an individual, the scale of a group, or a crowd? But it has nothing to do with scale. We’re doing it for the people, for them to feel comfortable there. It should be happier, more amusing. My dear lady, this is a museum not an amusement park. This is not a fair argument. Besides, I see no reason to discredit the so-called bad taste. I thought so. Johnson & Moore’s influence. But there is nothing to discuss. I thought I was here also to discuss. You’re wrong. You are here to help us with the drawings. If I don't have the right to speak, we really have nothing to discuss. No. Please, sit down. We’ll have some tea and talk calmly. Yes? Can I stay here? I've done everything. Stay. One more thing. This brick is a great material opportunity. It’s much cheaper. - That’s not an argument. - Why not? If the cost estimate is smaller, it will be easier to get approval. If you want to do something good, you cannot skimp on money. Cheaper and worse. It’s better not to do anything at all. My child... if you want to be an architect then remember that. You misunderstood me. I mentioned costs because other arguments did not convince you. In fact, I feel that this project done in this material does not make any sense. It’s ugly! It’s academic! Today nobody designs along these lines any longer. Leave! I’m sorry. I think I’ll leave, too. Good night. Bozena, calm down. I can't anymore. I can’t. He treats me like a dog. I want to leave. So why don’t you? I don't even have 200 zloty for a ticket to Warsaw. My God! How could you let yourself get to this state? You idiot. Here is about 300 zloty. If you think you should leave, then leave. Do you understand? You'll be at the office tomorrow as usual, right? Of course, I will. - Excuse me, where is the club Start? - In Wrzeszcz. Grunwaldzka 103. - It’s for everyone? - Yes. - Can I pop in? - You can. - Great. I’m with you. - Thank you. Extraordinary December Meeting of the Solidarity's National Coordinating Commission. The purpose of the meeting is to set up actions in relation to the academic situation after recent events in Bydgoszcz, which were considered an attack on the Union... But if it was sent why didn't it arrive? - We can't start with our work. - What happened? How long do we have to wait for it? What’s going on? She is talking to the ministry about the project. It always gets stuck in the same place. Well, let’s hope. All right, we can start. It’s on its way. Why are you making these spacing at 4, if it is clearly written for 6? Well, finally. You can finally pounce on this project. You see, I imagined it differently. It seems I am not really needed here. Or better start it all over again. Ewa... Jerzy proposes that you come and stay with us for this period. I am in the office all day. He needs someone to work at home. Besides, it's better than a hotel? I'm afraid, this will not be possible. I still have things here which are of interest to me. And in general,... I’d like to go back to Warsaw. Well, it’s up to you. 26, please. Excuse me. - I’d like to talk to you. - By all means. I’m listening. - I wanted to see you for a long time. - I’m listening. Do you know why you were summoned here? Nobody summoned me. I came here of my own will. What is it all about? It always starts like this. Some talks, discussions about art, arguments... - And then... - What then? I don't understand, what are you talking about? Then another victim is needed. And once they’ve squeezed you dry, they’ll throw you away like a piece of junk! Hold on. Just a moment. Don't you think that the way we are treated depends only on ourselves? Look... ...my name is Anna. - I was his assistant. - I know. I heard that I got sick. Fortunately, my health is robust. Maybe I'm overly ambitious, but I've always been damn independent and I always wanted to be independent. I won’t allow anyone to manipulate me. I came here because I wanted to come. Does this mean that you’ve already agreed to join this harem? Can you please leave. I’ve warned you. I’m leaving now, but I’ll be back. And you’ll tell me then. Hello, it’s Orzechowska. Is Maria there? Please tell her that I’ve made up my mind. Yes. I’ll came tonight with my luggage. Here we are. Here is a spare wardrobe. You can choose a bed. The window gets stuck a bit. Maria? Maybe this is not the right time, but I thought that if we were to work and live with us here for so many months, I wouldn't want, or rather I would want for you to like me a little. I really came here just to work. And did you think there could be anything? Well, no. I know that this is your way of being. I understand it. I know that you have experienced a lot in your life. Excuse me, don't you think that’s a little bit too early for this kind of confidentiality? I’m sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. I nearly forgot. Bozena asked to give it back to you. And I advise you, my dear, do not interfere in anyone else's affairs. She just seems hurt to me. I felt sorry for her. Six years ago, when she moved here with her suitcases, she didn’t feel sorry for Jerzy’s former wife. So, I’ll repeat, don't interfere in matters you know very little about. - I’ll be back in two days. - Come back. You will be needed here when we start drawing it all. Maria, you’ll walk her to the station, won’t you? You know… Lately I felt so... ...so lost and tired. I’m going to my mother’s now. I’ll walk you there. - Come on, let’s go. - I won’t bother you. It seems that I’ve actually interfered unnecessarily. You didn’t do anything wrong. She’s still a child who needs to be guided. Otherwise everything would fall apart. I don't think you should treat her that way. To me it’s inhuman and dishonest. Have you seen an honest artist who would write a poem or a few bars of music? Do you know what Dostoevsky was like? Are you kidding me? I am. Let’s get to work. There was another assistant here before me, right? You know that. Can you tell me honestly why she left? She was crazy. She was making scenes. Then she went to get treatment. Ask Maria. That’s what I thought. Let’s get to work. I have new arguments. She is fiddling with her hat. A very pretty one. All right. It’s ready. It’s ready. You’re the best. 18 again... Did she leave? She did. Then join us. We’ll talk in peace and quiet. You know that I almost convinced her. Not really. I’m not going to work anymore today. I feel sleepy. She is wise and experienced, but she doesn’t trust people. This time she’s wrong. How did you manage to survive like this? In this world? I think that if one wants something and knows what it is, one will always manage to survive. It is not true that we are like the reality that surrounds us. Everyone has something of their own. Remember not to lose it. Exactly. And I’d nearly given up. With me, you had no choice. Well, go then. - I’ll draw a little, all right? - No. I want to be alone. It’s just me. Jerzy is in my place and asked me to remind you that tomorrow the larger important trees on the site need to be re-measured, and data for the landscape architecture has to be collected. Don’t forget the measuring tape. Good night. So, it’ me who’s panicking, not the cooperative? There’ll be no cooperative here. Sooner hell freezes over. - Get out of here! - Calm down. Measure the area... None of this area measuring! Leave! Get out of here! - We’ll come back anyway. - Get out of here! All right. We’ll see. What’s going on? What is this? You bugger off as well. - Right now! - Ouch! Why are you so uptight? I didn't put it here, did I? I have to work here, too. Have a drink with us… Damn it! Shit! We are drinking to our project. Our joint project. I wanted to tell you that these people from the shipyard were on the building site today. The issue is quite serious. I think we can no longer pretend that we don't know anything. We have to talk to them. I told you once that politics are for other people and all we care about is work. Well, I’m off to bed. And I advise you to do the same. She... ...brought some samples, she wants to work with us. She's a great girl. Look… After all, you must be good at it. Come. Yes, indeed. I guess I'll go to bed, too. I don't care about your deals! We can no longer pretend that we don’t know anything. So, what if we have orders, when sooner or later everything will fall apart. Their delegates came, we had to agree with them. People are fed up with money being thrown down the drain. What are you saying?! So, according to you, building a museum means throwing money down the drain? What do you know about society and culture? Who gave you the right to speak like that? Jerzy, you misunderstand. - The comrade meant... - He meant me, right? Only that I… In my 30-year track record there hasn't been a swindle or lousy work. And everyone here knows about it. - They want to build a housing estate. - That’s nonsense. I suppose they'll give it to your offices. This can be arranged. “Arranged”. That’s the only word they know. Arrange whatever you want, but without me. I understand it all. But we can do nothing in this situation. Okay. I'll do it myself if I have to ... There must still be people in this country who haven’t lost their heads. Take care Jerzy. We are going to the ministry. If they’ve given us the job, they must be responsible for that. I think I won't be needed there. You are wrong. If I’ll go... then... it would probably be better if I stayed there. For many reasons. You will go and come back here. It’s not fun. And it is no longer a matter of your choice. Hello. I came earlier, because... Oh, Bozena. I'm glad you came back. Clean up here. We're going to Warsaw. This trip did you a lot of good. All right. Prepare something to eat. And Ewa and I will take a walk. Come on, Ewa. She cannot draw at all. I thought she would be useful, but I'm afraid she will ruin everything. I don't know who you are talking about. About this girl, who stayed with us yesterday. She must be replaced by someone else. And do you think that’s all right, after all that? After what? - Well. - A... These are two different things. What? Do you think… that I would let her ruin everything, just because I’ve slept with her once? For example, do you think it would be good if we… ...were to spend a night together? We are too much alike. And we still have… too much to do together. Jerzy... Okay. Maybe I won't kick her out yet. Well? I called several times. You know... Actually, where I live now there is no phone and so… - You've changed. - Everyone changes. Marek, you know what? During that time, I understood that one has be damn hard to do what one wants, what’s really important in life. Do you think this museum is really so important right now? And do you think that this trip to France is really so important now? It was important to you, when we were together, when we were studying. And now everything’s changed so suddenly? All right, Marek, I'll tell you what you want to hear. I fell in love. It’s only your imagination. You’ve made it up. Yes. Maybe I have. Don't you care that you are not the only one? You’ve always cared for your independence and self-respect. Marek... See, apparently self-respect is not what I need most right now. Go now. They’re coming back. - When are you leaving? - In four days. Good luck. Call me when you get back. But you don’t have a phone. Bye! I’m sorry. But we have to wait. I made the appointment for 10.00, right? I was punctual. - He’ll be back at 2 pm. - I’m back! - Where’s Bozena? - She went shopping. - We are leaving immediately. - That means you didn't get anything. If they don't have time for me, I don't care either. We are doing the project and quickly! Get in! Well! Where?! Sit in the back. In the back. From small to ever bigger. In contrast to the Guggenheim Museum. Ok. I think it would be good to differentiate it not only by size. Look, if we were to break this geometry with such soft lines… No, no. It is too distinct, too intrusive. All right. No problem. Let’s have a break. - It was supposed to be ready tomorrow. - It was, but it's already late. You go to bed and I'll finish it by myself. Do you know at least why we have to do it? I think I do. After all, it’s not on that only housing estates and nurseries are our legacy. No one knows anything about those hovels that surrounded the Gothic cathedrals or Romanesque castles. Only works of art create world history. Jerzy, if I did not understand it, I would probably... I promise you that I will work to my best ability. - And when we finish... - When we finish, I will leave. All right. Now you know everything. Almost done. You'll be able to take it to the office tomorrow. Judgments on the Athlete's Card have not yet resulted in a solution. Just before 3.00 in the morning the next round of talks between the government team and the National Coordination Commission of the seaport employees’ union Solidarity on the introduction of the Athlete's Card ended at the Maritime Economy Office in Warsaw. Since no agreement was reached... Good morning. Do you live here now? You are pretty! That’s good. Be good to him. Nowadays, there are few people like him. I’m sorry, I don’t understand. He was always like that. I knew he would be like that when he was very small. Did you know, he never wanted to play with children. He only read; and drew. And listened to music. I’m sorry. You’ve just arrived. Please, come in. Everyone is still sleeping, but I’ll wake... Does that mean that they... that everything is as it was? Yes. Perhaps. I’m very sorry. All right? - Any problems? - We are just calculating. Can I have a look? Where are the dimensions? What’s with those steps… Who did that? You have to correct it again. - Are you finishing? - Tomorrow. Sorry, you’ll have to correct it. Calculate it again. Actually, that’s enough. Where is Maria? Maria won’t be here. Jerzy asked her to stay home. His mother came. She has some important matter. I brought these projections for you. Jerzy worries that it will delay the whole thing. Nothing will be delayed. See for yourself, how they work here. I see. If we had everything ready now, we could do something about it, we could win; they wouldn’t stop it. You are wrong. They don't do it for a cause. They know that sooner or later it will be stopped. But they want to make as much money as possible. I don’t understand, what you are talking about. The percentage of work equals the percentage of pay. Are you telling me, that all of them are working here just for money? But that’s dishonest. - Dishonest? - Of course. It’s simply dishonest. And you? Tell me, but honestly, are you doing all this for a cause, or for yourself? These are the projections for you. Where is that little one? Which one? The one who worked on the second drawing board. She was doing details for us. She was... She’s no longer here. Jerzy decided that she didn’t know anything. At the press conference, Lech Walesa said that it was the most substantial and fruitful of all meetings to date. A number of important resolutions were adopted, addressing both, the situation in the country... During the Gdansk talks, the National Coordination Commission gave its full support to the social movement for employee self-government, expressed in the creation of employee councils and their founding committees. It also took a stance on the bill on trade unions. They’ve asked me to get out. I’ll sit here for a while. Go on, sit. What’s going on there? I don’t know. She is terrible to him. One has to fight with her over everything. - Who? - The old bag. You mean the mother, right? You're exaggerating. I talked to her. It seemed to me she loves him very much. I don’t like her! Can’t stand her! I’m so upset. - Will you have a drink? - No, thank you. I don't advise you to either. Maria checks these bottles. You’ll be in trouble again. I have my ways. Well, have a drink. No, thank you. Bozena! Oh hell! I have to get back there. Come with me to the kitchen. I beg you. Come. Help me. Bozena! Put it away, all right? I’ll go this way. What is it, for Christ´s sake?! I’m calling and calling… really! All I need is problems with you as well! Well? We’re going back to work. What happened? Can I help you with something? You are clever, young... Get out of here or you’ll will become like them. Get out as soon as possible. Yesterday, you said something different. Yes? Perhaps. Give it to him. And tell him that I had to leave early. We’ll use them as ducts for all installations, and they could also serve as inspection passages for renovations. Exactly. I said that all these things should be left outside. This is not a factory. You’re talking as if you didn't know what you were doing. Jerzy, wait a minute! I have something for you. Your mother left it before she went. Here. So, she gave in. Jerzy, listen. I do not want to interfere unnecessarily in somebody else’s affairs again, but what was yesterday’s argument all about? And is that why you are so angry today? We have almost nothing to live on. Maria has been supporting us for the past six months. Do you know when I had the last project? A little longer and this house will fall apart. Wait! Actually, why did you come back from the States? You would have work, money… I couldn't live there either. Look, I understand, but I think that after all... Do you think I would take this ring if I had money? I just want to have enough to be able to work in peace, to be independent of anyone, not to have to do potboils! Come in. Sorry to bother you. I’d like to talk to you. Of course. However, not at this hour perhaps. Let’s do it tomorrow. Yes. I’m very sorry. You won’t mind if I sit here for a while? Of course not. Go on. He is... gentle in bed. But he falls asleep right after it. And I would need… to talk to him. I’m not disturbing you, am I? No. I said you don’t disturb me. I fell in love with him as soon as I saw him. Such a great artist! He had a wife, but she didn't love him at all. She didn't want to sacrifice anything for him; not her job, nor her life. An egoist. Ewa? Do you think I could achieve something? Be somebody... Could I be somebody? Sure, you could. Yes. Do you know… Apparently, I played quite well once. But I fell in love and sacrificed everything. Everyone loves him. You love him, too, in a way. And Maria. Platonically, of course. I tell you a secret. She had a boyfriend once. She was a leader of the Trade Union; and he was, you know, “politically unsound” and she had to… you understand? She turned him in, right? Yes. And then she tried to commit suicide. She decided to devote herself to work; without any men. Sometimes it may seem that he is mean to me. But that’s not true. The main thing is that he doesn’t cheat on me. Do you know what? Go to bed, all right? He doesn’t cheat on me, right? Are you really as stupid as you look? Leave this bottle or it will end badly for you. - You’re disturbing me. - And you being here disturbs me! - Go to bed! - You being here disturbs me!! You wanted to talk to me, so here I am. It no longer matters. No. Anyhow, Jerzy is downstairs and he would like to start work earlier today. I’ll be down soon. I have just lain down. In Savigny there is a slab pressed into the ground like a coin and the lighting comes out from there. In Poland, they have no idea about it, but this is a chance for us and it is something for you. Jerzy, maybe I'll finish it tomorrow. I'll go lie down. It has to be ready tomorrow. We'll stay a little longer and get it done. Look. I must have a couple of hours sleep, at least. I feel tired. My dear, this is not fun. It must be ready for tomorrow and you know it. You’ve made your decision. Ewa, don’t joke! Maria! Maria! What happened? Oh my God! She fainted. You’ve worked her to death. Why are you standing around for Christ’s sake? Call a doctor! Water! Just wait... wait… Why don’t you eat? My hands are numb. It’s nicotine poisoning. A week in bed and it’ll be gone. - I have to finish it off. - I'll finish it. There are a few mistakes; I'll have to correct them anyway. It’s not true. There are no mistakes. I checked it many times. Can Jerzy come here? I want to talk to him. He is very busy now. But of course, I’ll tell him. Bozena is feeling very bad. Take care of her. Yes. You’re right. I’ll go to her. I’ll finish it all by myself. Thank you, Maria. You’re a wonderful friend, as always. I don’t know what I would do without you! Miss Ewa? It’s me. I came to talk to Jerzy and... I thought I'd see how you are. What happened? Tell me, please. I’m all alone here. I’ve asked him to come, but he never bothered. Do you know that I am a prisoner here? Please, calm down. When you get better... Please. Please, take me away from here. Take me away from here. Call a taxi. I want to go back to the hotel. Please! I’m sorry, but if you want to come with us, we are waiting in the car. Stay here. Please. Don't leave me here, alone. I have an appointment about the project. I’ll be back. I’ll be back. Did something happen? Jerzy? What happened? Nothing happened. They don’t want the museum. Jerzy, I told you, you have to talk to them, you have to convince them. You sit here idly. You’re holed up. I don’t think that’s on! You can’t give up! I think, you have to fight. I can’t do it. Right. Let’s calm down. Couldn’t this be done for him? Can't you do it just for him? After all, he is your man. I don’t know... after all, you know him better than I. It's important that he never made any deals, that his hands are clean. That he didn't use protection, connections... One person is not important today. Causes are important today. Exactly. Isn’t this a cause? Isn't it important for us to do something now, something that we will leave behind? Something permanent, something crucial. This museum will be… I don't know… It will be what we live for now, it will be a symbol. Yes. Only this city lacks flats, nurseries and kindergartens. Nobody cares about symbols anymore. Yes. But there were worse times and people gave up all this for the really important things, things that remain, right? I'm sure they’ll understand, only you have to explain it to them. I can’t do it. I’m a stranger here. What you are saying is very beautiful, but today everyone wants to live comfortably. Not go hungry. Earn money. One more thing. With this project... it is also the matter of your work that you’ve put into it. If you won’t convince them... nobody will pay you for it. Then why the hell don't you want to at least try?! All right. We’ll try. All right. They’ll do it for money. And this way, you won't be able to go back to Warsaw... Three cheers for Jerzy! Three cheers for Jerzy! For he's a jolly good fellow, For he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow! Which nobody can deny, Which nobody can deny! I must thank you. Could these eyes be lying? Don’t think so. Could they break a heart? No, no, no. Sit down. If it wasn't for you, I’d stop believing in anything. I stopped believing that the world still has something to offer. I did it... not only for this cause. I did it for you. You don't know how much it cost me. I had a tiny... I doubted… whether I was doing the right thing. Yes? But you did it. Yes. I did it for you. You are the first real woman that I met in my life. It is my great happiness that I met you. This is the political rhythm of the generation. Get up! I’m going to dance. Jerzy, she’s drunk. We have to do something. Get lost! Don't you understand, it’s serious this time. Jerzy, stop it, please! We have to do something. Leave it! Let her have her day as well. I’ve had enough. I’m going upstairs. I’ll wait for you there. Maria! Maria! - Maria, you are drunk! - So, what? Hands off, mate. Calm down. Get up! Maria? Maria? Get up! Maria? As soon as I saw you… I knew right away... Maria, calm down! - I hate you!!! - All right. Calm down. Get away from me!!! Out of my way! - She’s just a drama queen, come on… - Get your paws off me! Let me go! Maria?! Maria?! Maria? Maria! Maria, please. Maria, wait! Jesus! Wait! Maria! I’ll drown myself, you son of a bitch! I’ll drown myself! I’ll drown myself! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Let me go! Have you gone mad?! I’ll call them! They are all drunk! Go and get an ambulance! Jerzy? Jerzy? He is nowhere here. I don’t know what happened. Go and lay down. I’ll stay with her. Finally. I hope these robots have gone to work. I really have to thank you for your protection. My God, it’s the first time in my life that I agreed to a deal. Come here. Come. Do you know what happened? Give over! You don’t know anything. Maria tried to commit suicide. Is she alive? She’s alive. Jerzy, don't you understand that we are to blame for this? Calm down. Calm down. Jerzy, what’s that? Jerzy, have you gone mad?! - You have to think of yourself only. - Jerzy! Everyone got what they deserve! Let go of me! I’m sorry. Let me go! Looks like we had good fun. Jerzy just got us drunk. - Wacek, get up. - Are we going? Get up! I wasn’t right after all. There are no causes worth sacrificing people’s wellbeing. - Have a sleep. - No. Wait! Don’t you understand? You can’t let them build this museum. - But you convinced us. - You can’t! We are serious people. For us, our word is our word. I’m sorry. Good night. Part of the motorcade was stopped by the militia at the corner of Al. Jerozolimskie and Marszałkowska. There is a traffic jam there. The city centre is... I think, that we should... leave this place. All of us. Pack my things from the wardrobe. I won't need these papers anymore. And all of this? All of this... Let him sell it now himself. - You won't go anywhere! - I will. They will leave. And you will stay here. Listen. I used to think that too, you know. I was slaving away. Killing myself for your wonderful cause. I even cheated myself. And now I know it was all a façade. It was your selfishness. No. No. No. It wasn’t a façade or selfishness. That’s the one permanent thing, the only real value in my life. Yes. Except that your real value is not the same as mine. Let me go. Ewa, I don’t think it’s right, but if you want, I’ll give up the project. Have you gone mad? Jerzy. It’s not about this project. It’s not about the museum. It’s about all this. With you, I will change. No. You will never change. Because if you change, you’ll stop being yourself. And if you stop being yourself, you’ll start lying. You will lose what’s best in you. You will lose your power. You’ll be a nobody. Please. Calm down! That’s 37, 50. Just a minute. I have no change. Here we are. And 50, there... I knew she would go back to him. Calm down. Let’s go. Lady zoo, zoo, zoo, Lady sha, sha, sha... - Hello. - Hello. Sit here. I’ll look for some more seats. - The gentleman will help you. - Of course. Can I take your coat?
