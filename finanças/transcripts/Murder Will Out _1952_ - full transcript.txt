Well it's supposed to be commercial but I'm bound to say I haven't found my check books(?) of it I think the people should have practical experience of what they write about Why don't you try romance?

Sometimes That girl you were waiting for this evening Aren't you curious to know why Ronnie had to go to her flat? Yes,I think Well,if you'd waited you'd found out If I'd waited I wouldn't be here now Are you in love with her? In love? Yes You usually ask girls to dinner if you don't like? I didn't say I didn't like her I'm too inquisitive And I'm too obvious As a matter of fact Jean and I were meeting for the last time tonight I think we are both pretty relieved No appeals then? And no ties I'd like you to read one of my books If you could bear it Will you send me one? I've got a better idea Why don't you come and fetch it? Much too obvious Good morning,Jonathan Good morning You were in rather late last night,weren't you? Quite late Did you enjoy the concert? No,it was noisy The concert? The rabble was supposed to be listening to it Anything new in the paper? Yes,Parker's secretary has been murdered,Jean Bridges No See my old friend Inspector Thornton is in charge of the case I wonder who did it You knew her,didn't you? I did Good heavens I'm supposed to be in the theatre in half an hour I shall have to rush -I'm going to London shall I drop you off? -Thank you Extraordinary things these Two of them keep me alive and four put me under the ground I'll get the car What was she like? Who? Jean Bridges Oh,she loved life Most people do I hate it,I hate anything that hangs by a thread Are you not feeling better lately? I wouldn't say your life hangs by a thread You mean you only hope it does Was there anything very special about her? She was unusual Attractive I'm sure Generous -And intelligent? -On the contrary I rated her intelligence even lower than I do yours Thank you,my dear You want me to pick you up? No thanks -Hello,Thornton -Can I have a word with you? You can talk to me while we are rehearsing,my new play Should interest you,police inspector turns out to be the murderer "Oh I don't slate everybody,just Priscilla,please" -Good morning,Jonathan -Good morning "All right now,Henry,you're discovered back to the audience looking out of the window" "Georgina,you enter from the left" "Naturally you're surprised to see him" "Start your speech after he lit your cigarette" "Lydia,you're seated..." Have you discovered Jean Bridges' murderer yet? No,not yet When did it happen? We were not able to pinpoint the time but it It must have been soon after 7 30 pm last night -All right,Jonathan? -Yes,all right "All right take up your.." I was with myself in the afternoon Do you happen to remember the exact time? About 6 pm Do you mind telling me what you did after you left her? Yes I went to the park and fed the pigeons Did you meet anyone there that might have recognized you? They all did absurdly tame at this time of this year one of them even sat on my shoulder -What I mean is -Ssh "I didn't expect to see you" "I had to come back" "After we talked last night" "Everything seems so final yet so incomplete" Mr Bannister do you mind raising your voice this is not a bedroom scene "Yet so incomplete darling you must listen to me" Miss Thompson,you are not trying to escape from a piece of (?)believe it or not "Eric please " -Miss Thompson -What the hell is it now? Miss Thompson,you're a woman of spirit,a living flame You're in love with this man and yet you are repulsed by him -Mr Bannister -Yes You know how she feels towards you so try to employ a little more delicacy Your amorous advances should be a little more wary and a little less like a grizzly bear at the height of its (?) cycle I beg your pardon Of its mating season now do it again Yes,Mr Roach -"I didn't expect to see you" -"I had to come back" Are you still here? Did you meet any friends? My friends are out of London -All of them? -Both of them Will you please raise your voices a little -Acquaintances then? -None that I know of You didn't return to Miss Bridges flat? No,after the park I went to a concert at the Albert Hall I arrived ,let me see,about 8 pm At the end of the first movement I sat at the cheap seats as I always do Have you got any idea who did it? When you left the girl did she appear worried or upset about anything? No,she seemed in excellent spirit People usually are when I leave them "What do you think they did to me" "What sort of life do you think I've had since I married you" "Do you ever stop to think" "of the kind of life I could have had if I'd never met you?" "The opportunities I missed" Can you tell us anything about this girl's character that might help our investigations Yes,she had no brains with a sort of low animal cunning which served just as well Have you've been able to discover the motive? Not yet If you know of anything that might help us I'd be awfully grateful if you give me a ring at the Yard -Good day -Good bye Miss Thompson could you manage a little feeling in your voice? It will assist the audience to endure the expression on your face Difficult I'm sure -Nice chap -Charming -What next? -Hugh Allen Hi Hi there Good morning How did you get here? Your most excellent butler let me in -What's the time? - 10 30 am Have you seen the morning paper? Yes I have Poor Jean She didn't deserve that People don't deserve to be murdered in their own People I write about always do Have you ever tried writing beneath the surface? From your heart I wasn't aware I had one Till last night What happened last night? I met you Is that all? I mean all that happened? I didn't murder Jean Bridges I didn't ask you I thought I'd make the point quite clear -Is this one of yours? -Yes "Gale warning" can I take it? When you go -I'm going -So soon I can't wait to read it I'm supposed to be a good critic If I don't like it I'll advise you to sell motorcars Tell me are you attracted to me? Or just fascinated by my literary potentialities A wise woman let the man guess what she thinks Would you like to hide under the sofa? Thank you,no,I feel so foolish if somebody looked But if you do then say I was just leaving I shall know what to say -Mr Allen? -Yes Inspector Thornton of the Scotland Yard -May I have a word with you? -Won't you come inside? Thank you Excuse me I was just leaving Oh,Mr Allen I'll read your book and I may give you a telephone call tomorrow morning If you're still at large -Oh do sit down,won't you? -Thank you I understand you were a friend of Jean Bridges Yes Yes,I suppose you're aware that she was murdered last night Yes,she was going to have dinner with me What time did you arrange to meet her? -8 o'clock -At the Flamenco? -Yes -Where were you before then? I was driving up from the country,Rye What time did you leave there? About a quarter to 7 pm It'll take you about 45 minutes to get to town wouldn't it? No longer I had a slow puncture I had to keep on stopping to put more air in the tyre I had no spare I suppose you passed a number of garages that could have changed the tyre for you Most of them were closed Can you think of anyone who might have seen you on the road about 7 30 pm? No I can't -Is it important? -It could be May I ask you a personal question? Were you in love with her? No The orchids rather suggested that you'd might have been Did you ever,did you ever quarrel with her? -Yes,frequently -What about,another man? -Yes -Who was it? She wouldn't tell me That's why we quarrelled I see -Is there anything else? -Yes Were you aware that she was a convicted blackmailer? Yes Thank you -Good day -Bye The porter found her at 7 50 pm when he delivered the orchids But three are men who can't establish an alibi during the twenty five minutes in which she was murdered Now Roach was somewhere between Hyde Park and the Albert Hall Parker was in his office alone And Hugh Allen was driving from the country Each knew Jean Bridges And each had an opportunity of killing her What do we do next? We have three men to watch And I think their behaviour is going to be very revealing Thank you,Pierce What are you reading? "Gale warning" by Hugh Allen -Allen? -Do you know him? I've heard of him Through Parker? Probably,where did you meet him? Parker introduced us This isn't at all bad You care to read it? No thanks His style reminds me a little of some of your earlier works Before you decided to become an intellectual snob Alycia Are you deliberately trying to annoy me? Not at all And don't compare a down and out hack with one of the field marshals of British literature Oh,he isn't down and out by any means Have you made up your mind yet about the BBC broadcast? Yes,I've decided not to do them Why not? I don't like broadcasting It seems a pity to waste all that material And the BBC are offering you a lot of money,Jonathan That's unusual It'll go towards your income tax What an inducement Anyway I don't like the stories they're old and dated -The BBC liked them -Naturally And they don't know you wrote them I submitted them under a pen name You what? Yes,I was curious to know whether they'd recognize great writing,when they saw it Frankly they did What name did you use? Merrill If you don't want to do the broadcast let's get someone else to do them Who do you suggest? It doesn't really matter -Staff announcer -Not -Actor -An actor? Well then,how about a writer,an unknown There must be dozens who'd jump the chance of broadcasting for a field marshal of British literature Alycia,I'm intrigued to know why you pursue my business interest with so much avidity Business is the only thing we have in common,Jonathan And after all you made me your manager Good night,Jonathan Your holiday was wonderful Remind you don't fall in Of course I won't Hurry up,slow coach I've just got to tie up I've got the radio thing You don't need the radio Heavenly And we met only three days ago What is it? Jonathan? Leave him Do you really want it? Of course I do,darling I love you But I can't ask you,I'm a failure -Don't say that,it isn't true -But it is true Look I read your books Do I have to sell motorcars? No Seriously,not as long as you can write books like "Gale warning",it's good Obviously it needs a little more work but it's all there Well,Parker didn't think so Parker doesn't know I want you to meet Jonathan Why? I have an idea Trust me What time's dinner? Madam has asked it to be served at 8 o'clock,Sir All right Tell me the bad news,the truth If you take things easily you might live for 5 years -but if you don't -How long? Three months at the outside A man can do a lot in three months I want you to carry on with the digitalis and get this prescription made up To take in the event of an attack I'll give it to Pierce What is it? Apemphy(?),see that you don't exceed the dose You know,you're a terrible trial to me,Jonathan Am I your worst patient? By far the worst -I like distinction in everything -Quite incorrigible If you change your mind about the work -I won't -Good night,Jonathan Good night Well,that's that What did Dr Forrest have to say? He said my expectation of life was a small as my ego Small? Now you should live to be a hundred You wouldn't like that,would you? I haven't thought about it And why not think about it now -Jonathan -Yes Try not to force a quarrel My dear girl,nothing was further from my thought I came in to talk to you about Hugh Allen Parker spoke to me about him this afternoon Did he? Parker thinks he's worth watching I'm sure he'll benefit from your interest Yes,I'm sure he will I might give him that BBC job we talked about Take him under my wing so to speak I can watch him closely under my wing Good evening,Sir Hello,Hugh How are you Tell my husband Mr Allen's here,will you? Very good,Madam Nervous? Shaking like a leaf Darling,I thought you'd fallen Seriously Jonathan read your books he'll take the trouble to pull it to pieces He may be unbearable,he'll patronize you Try to put up with it,for my sake Jonathan,this is Hugh Allen,my husband I have to excuse you a little dinner time Alycia,I'm very busy Perhaps you'll look after our guest -You are dining with us? -Oh certainly I wouldn't miss Mr Allen's dinner conversation for the world It looks very might be rather scintillating Besides I'm anxious to learn something about you What's that,Sir? I want to find out if you ever read a book I've just discovered you haven't written one Excuse me,won't you Unbelievable isn't he? Yes,that's putting it mildly Come and have a drink you'll need one Of course your power of description is practically non-existent But you may not be a very acute observer,Mr Allen You should open your eyes,occasionally And what about character? Oh,your strokes are much too broad No finesse no light in shade I'm not saying your work entirely lacks promise Thank you Mr Parker is here,Sir Oh,ask him to wait,will you,Pierce -He's in the study,Sir -Thank you Weren't you going to speak to Mr Allen about the broadcast series,Jonathan? Oh yes Parker suggests you might be suitable to broadcast a series of stories of mine At a nominal fee Are you interested? Yes Alycia will arrange the terms how many hours Alycia? Twelve The BBC want to broadcast them over a period of 12 weeks And as I personally don't want my name connected with them We've chosen a pen name What was it Alycia? My maiden name Oh,yes Merrill What made you think of that? I tried to think of something I associated with happiness,Jonathan Anyway in order to avoid complication You're unaware of the name of the author -Is that understood? -Quite Go and look after,Parker for me,will you,Alycia? I'll see you in a few minutes Very well -You're an admirer of beauty,Mr Allen -I hope so I suppose you're thinking how lucky I am to be possessed of a wife as lovely as Alycia Yes,I suppose I was Naturally,Mr Allen,your human is your only asset Have you ever thought whether or not I appreciate my good fortune? I wouldn't presume to Surely we men of letters can disclose our thoughts to one another without encroaching on personal feeling Frankly I don't know whether you appreciate your wife or not Oh,but of course I never show it I always suspect men who admire their wives in public of beating them in private I can't imagine anybody beating Alycia What a charming compliment I wish I could think of nice things to say about people But I never can while they're alive After they're dead it's easier And speaking of the dead what made you break off your engagement to Jean Bridges? I wasn't aware that you knew her It's surprising the people I know I was her father confessor She told me how unhappy you made her -We were never officially engaged -Really? Jean led me to believe the contrary Still,women are like that,aren't they? Well,I must go and see what Parker wants Alycia will join you in the drawing room It was nice of you to speak to my husband about Hugh Allen Thank you Ronnie I tried to please,Alycia Good evening See you later -I'm in deep water,Jonathan -I know you are Who told you? Your late lamented secretary Who blackmailed you over some little falsification she found in the company's books I was most interested to discover that my co-director had joined the criminal classes I need 3,000 pounds,Jonathan -To cover it up with -I borrowed the money -Thinking I could pay it back -Oh yes, they all do And Jean was a very clever little girl discovered you hadn't paid it back I wondered when you were going to ask me to help you If the books were audited I'd be arrested for fraud Jolly bad luck Will you help me? Why should I? -I was counting on you -Is that a good reason? We've been friends for a long time It mustn't make crime too easy for you It might start you off again No,I'm sorry Ronnie Extraordinary girl wasn't she? Amazing courage and resource I'm glad you think so You must be bitter,Ronnie Remember the old superstition to speak ill of the dead They'll arise and slay you I'm sorry you can't stay BTW that was a good idea of yours having Allen broadcast these stories I've decided to let him do them -Jonathan -Good night Ronnie Parker asked me to say goodnight He's feeling rather depressed business isn't so good Here's the first three scripts you'd better take them home and read them Thank you And don't alter one single line To deliver you from temptation I shall send you the others one day before each broadcast As to the name of the series Since this was entirely your idea,Alycia We'll call it "the Voice of Merrill" All right Tonight representing the first of a series of twelve original stories written by a modern author who prefers to be anonymous The stories are brought to you by the Voice of Merrill I am the voice of Merrill I'm going to tell you a story which might be yours or mine I wonder how many times in our lives we use the word if If I had done this how different things would have been If this had happened or that The whole course of my existence might have been altered So it was with Helen Selby Fate sat in a corner of her life like a spider Spinning the curious web That devised tragedy or success or failure According to its whim I found the door of Helen's apartment austerely closed as though determined to share no responsibility The tragedy it conceive You're very quiet,darling This is a celebration I was wondering how all this was going to help my career as a writer It will,I promise you -But how? -Leave it to me Anything else worry you? What do you think The first time since I've known him I now feel sorry for Jonathan He's a very sick man We have all our lives To us and your success,Mr Merrill This is the third of a series of stories brought to you by the voice of Merrill Life started to ebb from the body that had long since begun to die I am the voice of Merrill Louise was the loveliest woman I had ever seen Her voice was like a gentle whisper Her beauty came into my life like a radiant light I can see her now silhouetted against the endless sky listening to the first footfalls of her lover's approach Turn it off,Pierce Do you follow that program? Yes,Sir,it's most interesting -Beautiful written -Oh, beautifully,Sir The style reminds me of yours Although hardly up to your standards You have been listening to the voice of Merrill -Another Merrill fan,eh? -Yeah,pretty good -I've been trying to place the voice -Hugh Allen -What's that,Sir? -I said that is Hugh Allen Oh really? Well,I managed to find Jean Bridges' banking account That girl got some nom de plumes Nom do what,Sir? ??? that means other names Make me an appointment with Ronald Parker in the morning,will you? Right,Sir Every successful writer should have a secretary Johnathan hasn't got one Only because they can't stand him To hear you talk anyone would think I wrote the Merrill stories Would they? I wonder what goes on in that genius brain of yours Wait and see I can't really afford a secretary You won't have to I'm not gonna let you pay Time you got down to some really serious work I'll find you a secretary that will stop you thinking of anything else I choose her with great care I don't want any rivals Hello,Sara the secretary speaking Oh,Mrs Roach Yes,Mr Allen is just here -Hello -Hello,Hugh -Everything all right -Oh yes yes Just fine What time are you through at the BBC? The rehearsals is 11 am I should think about 1 pm I'll pick you up And darling Yes I love you Oh,yes,I think so too Good bye More fan mail is arrived for the Voice of Merrill,Mr Merrill I mean Mr Allen it's so confusing More enquiries about you personally Everybody's just dying to know who you are And what you look like They'd get a quite a shock,wouldn't they? They certainly would,Mr Merrill,Mr Allen 3,000 pounds deposited in your name Mr Parker Do you mind telling me why you gave your secretary so much money? It was a loan Did she offer any security? I didn't ask for any Really And she,she didn't say what the money was for? No Tell me,had she access to the firm's accounts? Yes she had And that in view of her record you have no objection to the police examining them I'm sure there's no need for that Are you? Well,we'll see There he is Hold it Mr Merrill Thank you Hello there Anything wrong? I was wondering why I've just being photographed by the press Were you? I'm afraid that was a little premature What do you mean? I'll tell you Matey aren't they? Yes,the highway of success,Baker is still with men being pushed along by women Why aren't they doing the shopping Sit down and go on and get in When did first think of this? Does it matter? Are you really suggesting that I should playing the work as my own? Only if Jonathan dies I can't do that Why not? For the simple reason I didn't write the Voice of Merrill stories But you will have written so much by then The important thing is that when a novel like "Gale warning" comes out It'll be noticed because you'll already have a name Well,that's all very well A name will take you years to establish in the ordinary way but if -Jonathan finds out -Jonathan doesn't want his own name connected with the voice of Merrill so we wouldn't be robbing him of anything What about Parker he knows I didn't write the stories I'll handle Parker All I want you to worry about is your writing Except when you're with me -Madam back yet,Pierce? -No,Sir -Excuse me,Sir, -Yes On the front page,Sir Isn't that the gentleman who dined here a few weeks ago? -Yes it is -Thank you,Sir Alycia I'd like a word with you What is it? I've been hearing quite a lot about our program lately It's astonishingly successful isn't it? Yes it is Stories must be better than I thought So difficult to be completely objective of one's own work Anyway I decided to let the public into our little secret I propose to announce that I'm the author But you can't do that Can't? I mean the whole reason for its success is the fact that it's anonymous The public intrigued mystified Anonymous? Really?Do you call that anonymous? I suppose that you knew nothing about it did you? No And nor did your friend Mr Allen Posing like a 5th grade matinee idol No,Jonathan he didn't No,no,Mr Merrill,author of the Voice of Merrill I suppose he was unconscious when that was taken Well,what are you expecting him to do? -Wear a mask -No I don't I think he should stick to the contract or is that inconvenient? Will it stifle his status as writing the Primrose part at the success on my back He would be mad anyone would think he disclosed his own name Why didn't he,it's the next logical step,isn't it? Or are you waiting after I'm dead -Let me go -No I know I'm not Hugh Allen If I were to die tonight you rush to prove he didn't write the stories,wouldn't you? It'll be worth while chinkling (?) for,wouldn't it,Alycia? Answer me Take your hands off me I'm sure he wouldn't be opposed to having the success and prestige of a genius plastered on to his own puny talents He wouldn't mind crawling through the mud to say you showed him the way Did you (?)this? Alycia Tablets on the dressing table Quickly -How many? -Two Hello,may I speak to Mr Roach,please The master was taken ill last night,Sir Dr Forest has given instructions that he isn't to be disturbed I see Do you care to speak to Mrs Roach,Sir? No,thank you,Pierce,I'll I'll phone later Dr Forest is still with the Master,Pierce -Yes,Madam -He has to remain quiet for a long time I understand,Madam BTW I think I should disconnect the telephone in his room when he is asleep -We don't want to disturb him -Very good,Madam Hello,who's speaking please Oh,Mr Parker,just one moment I'm sorry Mr Allen is in a conference I'll tell him Mr Parker rung That's certainly the right way to treat publishers,Mr Allen Especially when they start running after you Hello,just one moment,I'll see if Mr Merrill can speak to you It's the Standard Tell them I'll get in touch with them I'm sorry,I'm afraid Mr Merrill is in a script conference Is there anything I can do? I'm his secretary you call again Good bye Hello,I couldn't possibly interrupt Mr Merrill at the moment Oh yes,writing a play a novel And a further radio series I beg you pardon I'll ask him for you Good bye -Good morning,Miss Quinn -Good morning,Mrs Roach I thought you were out No I wasn't out The telephones,they haven't stopped ringing Silly,wait that was the Echo They want to know what Mr Merrill did in his spare time But excuse me I think I'll go to lunch Alycia Mrs Roach,you won't forget to telephone the Pancroid Press about Mr Allen's stories They are waiting a reply to their proposals Thank you,I won't forget What stories? A collection of the Voice of Merrill series I'm arranging publication under the Merrill name You're not serious Darling I know what I'm doing It'll be months before they come out and by that time Jonathan maybe Oh for heaven's sake let's drop this whole fantastic idea we can't gamble on -Why not? -Why? Because Look Jonathan had his worst attack last night The doctor doesn't think he can survive another I know the idea was to wait but and now the newspapers are almost on to it It'd be foolish to go back You've organized the whole thing perfectly for me haven't you? Do you really mind so much? Have you forgotten Parker knows? Parker has too many worries of his own to bother about us Darling,look at me I'm not really a hard designing woman I love you and I just want you to have everything that you want for yourself,success But of course I want success But I want to get it on my own merits not Jonathan's But you will All I'm trying to do is to save you being worn out and frustrated by the long climb to the top can't you see that? Oh once you're there you have the talent and ability to stay does it matter how you get there Oh come on darling I know I'm right,believe me Look,look at these Fan mail letters to the Voice of Merrill They're coming into the BBC by the rate of hundreds a day Jonathan must be very pleased Why should we have to talk about Jonathan -Well,after all Jonathan.. -Jonathan,Jonathan-Alycia! I'm sorry I've got to go I thought you were lunching with me No I forgot to tell you I'm luncheon with Sir John Gregson We're going to talk about a new series (??)they'll pay you very well So you'd better start to work remember keep the same style of writing We'll lunch tomorrow my darling and one day soon all the days of our life I trust you have a good appetite,Sir I could eat a horse Not the smell perhaps Excuse me,Sir -Probably that fool Parker -Yes,Sir -The master is in his room,Sir -Thank you,Pierce How is chicken,Jonathan? Stop asking damned silly questions,sit down -I want talk to you -You must be furious about Allen You'll expose him of course It looks something like a deliberate Stop chattering,you know I loathe the sign of anybody's voice then my own I've been thinking about your little financial problem And I've decided to help you I shall be extremely grateful Jonathan you see I On one condition Oh,stop wandering about man, get a chair and sit down Under no circumstances either now or the future Will you reveal to anyone that Allen's claim to be the author of my stories is not true -Not true? -N O T spelled not But I don't understand You don't have to Bring me that chair -But surely I'm not going to -I'm not let him get away with it I'm still very much alive and have plenty of time to work out Allen's punishment Before I give you this check I want your solemn promise Hugh Allen wrote the Voice of Merrill Is that's the way you want it,Jonathan? That's the way I want it I don't know what you have in mind I want him to have his hour I want to open his gullet and swallow the whole Milky Way Higher he climbs the harder he'll fall And I want you to write a letter A letter? To Hugh Allen For that you're getting three thousand pounds to put things right at your office So the police need never know that Jean Bridges has been blackmailing you And they never realized what an excellent motive you had for murdering her Will they? Jonathan -Should you be up? -Of course not dear According to Dr Forest I should pushing up daisies I certainly don't intend to do that just yet The uncertainty must be quite terrifying for you Incidentally has Allen done anything about that preposterous claim of his? What preposterous claims? Alycia Oh,you mean the photograph Yes,I'm sure he'll trying to do something about that When?Next year Whenever he's finished reading the series I suppose you would prefer him to make his own little confession wouldn't you? Yes please Jonathan Unless I should happen to die in the mean time And it wouldn't be necessary,would it? I can see that's the upper thoughts in your mind at the moment -Oh,Pierce -Sir Tell me how would you do if you were suddenly informed you only had a short time to live Oh,speaking quite impersonal you understand,Pierce I trust so,Sir Oh,fascinating position in which to found oneself in,don't you think? Little eery,Sir However I suppose ones natural instinct would be to do something little daring,Sir Depending upon how much energy one could expend in the process Speaking for myself,Sir,there's a complete nonentity as it were I would be inclined to perform at least one small act of national service And what would that consist? It will entail the shooting of at least two prominent cabinet ministers,Sir I'm convinced the only thing deterring a number of persons from a similar course is the fear of the consequences if one could remove that I see your point May I be permitted to inquire what you would do,Sir? Of course,Pierce,I should write my greatest story Probably to read after my death It would be about a girl with three men friends She deceives each one in turn Oh,yes,Sir Yes and she irritates one to such an extent That he decides to teach her a sharp lesson -So he shoots her -Indeed,Sir You won't forget your medicine,will you,Sir No,all right Good morning,Mr Allen Good morning What is it? It's from Parker Mr Jonathan Roach requested me to take care of the last remaining story in the Merrill series I will therefore pass to the BBC for approval in the usual way and deliver it to you in reasonable time before you are due to go on the air May I see? Go on the end Mr Roach has informed me that the BBC and the general public had remained permanently under the impression that you were the original author of this series I wonder what Jonathan If he's trying to humiliate me he's chosen a funny way of doing it Sent apart these letters Do we have to use his story? Why can't we use the one I've written? I'm afraid it's not quite good enough,darling Oh,what's wrong with it? You can do better when you're not quite so worried I see Of course you can Alycia Jonathan is waiting for me to read the last story in the Merrill series before he breaks me,isn't he? Perhaps but darling he might do anything he's quite unpredictable He hates me He hated me from the very first moment we met What are we going to do? I won't let him break you Alycia I don't know what I going to do but I think of something -Listen to me -Don't call me I'll get in touch with you Pierce,I want Mr Parker to have this by tonight I see to it,Sir Thank you Thank you,Pierce,I forgot my keys The master is in the study Madam -Isn't it your night out? -Yes,Madam You can go whenever you like I shall be in this evening Thank you You won't let the master forget his medicine at 8 o'clock,Madam? Just two drops -Where's Pierce? -It's his night out he went off early I told him I get your medicine for you It's alright I've taken it -You took your medicine? -Yes When does Allen do his last broadcast? This Thursday I suppose he's told you I've decided not to expose him as a fraud He has Kind of me,don't you think? Unusual of you Yes Instead I'm going to prove that he murdered Jean Bridges Why do you say he murdered her? That's not quite the point I said I was got to prove he did it Oh,I see you don't appreciate the irony of the situation,Alycia I'm afraid I don't Nor the pleasures of uncertainty of not knowing what's around the corner,perhaps If that's a pleasure I've certainly had it since I was married to you You should be congratulated Most women find life rather dull after five years of marriage You can't say that about ours No,Jonathan Ours was never dull Good night,Jonathan Good night I told you to keep away why did you come here for? I came to stop you Hugh This will haunt us the rest of our lives He had a heart attack You'd always think of it like that Yes We'll always speak the same I'll telephone the doctor You must go before he gets here Whatever you do wait for me to get in touch with you Go New style Standard Thank you,Sir Read all about it famous author dies New style Standard Dear Parker,I've cause to believe that for a reason in which you must be aware my wife is planning to murder me in the circumstances I think it would be advisable to take the necessary steps to ascertain beyond doubt the cause of my death Yours truly Jonathan Roach He says for a reason of which you must be aware of What is that reason? Anything to do with Hugh Allen? I believe so I,I happen to know that Mrs Roach is in love with him Any other reason? Isn't that enough ? Well if you subscribe to the view that love justifies murder I suppose it is After all a number of people have thought so A man suffering from cardiac liable to pop off at any moment and a wife who feel that moment may never come It's interesting,quite interesting Well,thank you Mr Parker You'll keep in touch with us,won't you? -All right -Order a car,Baker-Yes,Sir You haven't forgotten your appointment with Alison publications have you,Mr Allen -What time is it for -11 o'clock Use our headache tell him I can't make it Has Mrs Roach telephoned this morning? No,no she hasn't Will you get her for me now? I'll take it in here Inspector Thornton to see you,Madam And Mr Allen to speak you on the phone Thank you I'll ask him to hold the line Good morning I'm sorry to trouble you at a time like this But from information received I'm compelled to ask for an autopsy on the body of your husband Purely a formality What information? I'm afraid I can't disclose that Have you any objections? Then I'll make the arrangements I won't trouble you more than necessary Hello,Alycia Hugh I had to phone is everything all right? Yes,yes of course everything's all right But you sound worried,are you sure? Quite sure Listen,darling I may not be able to see your broadcast tomorrow Why not? There's so much to do here,you know Arrangements and things I shall be listening to you,of course,as usual Alycia If anything should happen you let me know,won't you? Of course I will,hi darling Don't worry -Good evening,Ronnie -Good evening Your script Thank you Allen? Now that Jonathan is dead I think the least you can do is to tell the truth But if you feel so strongly about it why don't you? Because I gave Jonathan a promise not to expose you -What was his object? -I don't know Whatever it is I have to respect it I'm sorry Ronnie Well I hope you enjoy your triumph And I hope it won't be too short-lived What do you mean? You haven't heard about the autopsy? Autopsy? The police have reason to believe that Jonathan may have been poisoned They've ordered an autopsy You look very nervous of that already You're on the air in five minutes,Mr Allen Hello,hello Come in It's Mr Allen Hello Alycia I've just heard Now listen to me whatever you do don't talk to the police I'm going to them myself after the broadcast No,darling I shall say that I quarrelled with him over the stories and saw the chance to put that stuff in his glass No Hugh Oh,I wanted it to happen as much as you did I knew you were going to do it, I could have stopped you But you did try -Mr Allen they are waiting for you -Right -Alycia -Hugh Hugh,darling,no I'd like to see Mrs Roach,please Inspector Thornton to see you,Madam Show him in I have to inform you,Madam,that the autopsy ordered on your late husband showed that he died from natural causes I shan't have to to trouble you any more Good day,Madam Hugh Pierce Madam What are you doing? I was removing a stain from the carpet,Madam I think the Master must have dropped his port wine glass before he died The voice of Merrill number 12 written and told by Hugh Merrill I decided to kill Jean not through jealousy an emotion I have always deplored but because of the insults she levelled at my intelligence that I could never forgive Her excuses her miserable protestation of innocence would scarcely have annoyed me had they not been accompanied by the impertinent presumption that I would accept them How dare she I had known about Jean's lover for some time He was a writer like myself Please,hurry I laid my plans very carefully I parked my car some distance from the block of flats and walked the rest of the way I passed no one I knew it was dark when I reached the street where she lived The kind of night that suited me well cold and black with few people abroad I walked slowly measuring my tread and feeling the pain of my aching heart I made my way into the front entrance building because I knew the porter would not be there I had thought even of so lowly creature as the night porter Jean was barely important enough to kill She was certainly not important enough to hang for As I drew near to her room and heard the sound of cheap music that so typified her I felt only one momentary qualm then it vanished At this last glimpse of feminine complacency Is that you,darling? I looked at the vase she had knocked over And the water dripping into the open handbag And somehow I caught from this a strange sense of foreboding for someone I wondered if it was for me You've been listening to the voice of Merrill written and told by Hugh Merrill A vase with water dripping into an open hand bag Good heavens He's told an almost parallel story with the Bridge's murder and he's disclosed something in her flat that only the murderer apart from ourselves could possibly have known about The voice of Merrill got some explaining to do BBC Mr Allen I was coming to see you Were you? We found your story very interesting Based on fact wasn't it? On personal experience No Are you sure? You wrote it didn't you? No I didn't write it It was written,it was written by Jonathan Roach This gentleman can prove it Are you prepared to say,Hugh Allen did not write the story you just broadcast? Well No,I'm not prepared to say Mrs Roach can prove I didn't write it In that case we'd better have a word with her Do you mind coming along to the Yard? You too,Sir,if you don't mind Could I have your autograph please,Mr Merrill Me too please Thank you Thanks very much Hugh Don't say anything to them Everything All right After all Of course Keep trying My love God bless you There's something I should explain to you,Inspector All right Subtitles by Nostromo
