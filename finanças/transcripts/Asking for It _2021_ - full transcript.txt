Gentlemen and gentlemen, Mr. Mark Vanderhill! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! - Mark. - Mark. - I freakin' love you. - Thank you. You the fuckin' man. - You, ha-ha! - Love you. The way you changed my fuckin' life. I have a message to spread that I believe can save thousands if not millions of lives. I owe everything to you, man. He understands what I'm about, and that's why I joined his movement. We're a movement that remains prepared. Mark, you taught me how to reclaim my power as a man. You see it, you want it, you take it. Setting the example. Mark saved me from being a beta male. That's natural. That's an expression of dominance. The most important thing that has happened... It's a natural movement. ...is the creation of the MFM. MFM. MFM, baby. The male exerts dominance over the female. It's fucking science! Oh, he's so sexist. Oh! - Fuck these hos. - Shut the fuck up. Well, feminists claim they want equality, but what they really want is power. - "No" don't mean "no." - "No" means try harder. This is the sort of imagery the liberal media doesn't want you to see. White, straight men enjoying themselves. That's when those fucking liberal pansies are gonna listen. - And if they don't... - Boom! - Boom. - My M4 Carbine rifle will do the talkin' for you. Time to show these snowflakes who's fuckin' boss! You wanna know what we think about your sensitive politics and these issues, yeah? Fuckin' that's what we think! - All right. - Thanks. You goin' huntin'? Oh, I just like to stay prepared. Okay, there's nothing wrong with that. Can I get a... A cheeseburger deluxe, bloody rare, with barbecue sauce on the side? Hey, you know your girl's order. Yeah, I know everybody's order. Um, well, I'm gonna throw a curveball at you and get a slice of cherry pie. Honestly? The cherry pie is, like, kinda trash. It's just like Foster's and they microwave it. But the key lime pie is homemade. Key lime sounds great. All right, key lime. Joey. - Mike! - Hey. - Hey! - Hey. What... - Oh, my goodness. - Hi! - It's so good to see you. - You too! You look amazing! Oh! Well, thank you. What are you doing here? Um, I got into law school, um, so my social life is over. - Wanted to... - Okay. ...come hang for a bit, yeah. So I graduated a semester early. - Cool. Good for you. - What about you? You know, just... I'm just here. - It's... It's awesome. - Yeah, it's awesome. Um, I'm havin' a party tonight. Totally come. It's gonna be just bonfire and drinks and... yeah. Sure. That sounds fun, okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Well, I'll get out of your way. - Okay. Okay, cool. Yeah, I'll see you later. - Okay. - See you. Bye. - Uh, we good? - Yeah. Roll, roll, roll it. I'm feelin' it. And we're back, fellas. It's Mark Vanderhill, your b-b-boy. Dr. Vanderhill here, Vanderhill Files, part two. Two. T-Two. Part two. Two. In the field. All right, I wanna review part one really fast 'cause it's important. We talked about identifying a target. Ta... Ta... Tar... Target. Janine is pregnant again. - Alan and Marie's daughter? - Mm-hmm. - She just had one! - I don't know why you surprised. Alan and Marie had 11 children. They must think pretty high of themselves, assuming the world needs that much of them in it. - Hey, Pop. - Hey, baby. Ooh, I'm hungry! Not too hungry to say grace. The dishwasher broke at work, so Marco's got us hand washing, which is unfair, 'cause that's not my job. It's not unfair, baby. That's work. Whoa, wait, wait a minute. She a waitress, not a dishwasher. Now, Marco want her to do more work, - he need to give her more money. - Mm-hmm. Thank you, Pop. You're gonna spoil her mind with that talk. Marco's a bully. Always has been. You push right back at him. - Oh! - I will, Pop. Vanderhill Files, part two. We're in field. We talked about opener. Do you know about the Vanderhill technique? Sorry, don't mean to alarm you. Just... I gravitated towards you. Feels like you could use a little somethin'. You're a little messy, but, you know, you're cute. - Can you cook? - No. Oh, well, then that's enough of that. - You're beautiful, I mean... - Thank you. All the makeup. Is this your natural skin tone or is it... Is it a little darker without the makeup? Can I see? You saw the negging work. Negging kicks ass. Neg... Neg... Negging. Like you saw it, right? You saw it, right? Right? Right? Right? I wanna show it to you and I wanna give it to you, so that you can use this tonight. Yes. Got you there. Nope. You wish, motherfucker. What about you? You're not planning on serving coffee for the rest of your life, are you? Um... Oh, sorry. Sorry. I did not mean that like that. No. No, you're not wrong. I, um... I thought about being a nurse. You can get your license without going to college. Um, I know. That's weird. Uh, so, yeah, I... I can do online classes and still go to school. Oh, no, go to work. That sounds like... That... I mean, that sounds like something you'd be amazing at. You'd be great at that. Thanks. I feel kind of sick. I need to go home. You can crash here if you want. I like you and I'm having fun, but... I need to go. Okay. - Um, let me walk you home, okay? - Okay. I'm pretty sure I pulled out in time, but just in case, you should probably take Plan B. Bye. No. No. Joey. So maybe there's somethin' here after all, despite the faults? All right. And that's... Right on my heart line. And... - And your name was? - Tanya. Tanya. Mark. Mark Vanderhill. Right, and that's how we do it, right? It's simple. It's easy. It's nothing you have to think about. Joey. What happened? I just hurt my hand. Nana fixed me. How you doing, Joe? Just powering through. You sound like Nana talkin'. You know that strength that your grandmother talked about? That's how she survived. But it was also her only option. I know. She dealt with it by dealin' with it, whatever it was. That don't mean the same go for you. There's different ways to show strength. That's all? A cup of coffee, black and sweet. - Okay. - Just how God made you. Joey! Sorry. Sorry, um... It's okay. It's all good. It's... It's all good. Yeah, yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I just... Can I get you a, um... Jesus. Thanks. No problem. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, uh, no. Uh, I am not fine. You got plans tonight? Um, no, it's been a long work week. Come get a drink with me. I'm not really in a social mood. Well, if you change your mind, I'll be at yours at 8:00. They use their front legs to snare their prey with reflexes so quick they are difficult to see with the naked eye. This poor male cricket... Hey, Nana, I'm goin' out. Okay. Who you goin' out with? Uh, someone I met at work. What's her name? ...its prey, camouflaged by the green... I don't know. You don't know your friend's name? What kind of person doesn't tell you their name? You know, you can come up and knock on the door like normal folks! - Sorry. - My gran. - It's all good. Get in. - Yeah. Go inside! I feel like I should tell you that, um... ...I'm not gay. Okay. I'm not tryin' to sleep with you. I just want to show you something. - Show me what? - You'll see. What's she singin' about? Revenge. I'm confused. This is where we're havin' a drink? Yeah. Come on. Hello. Fala, this is Joey. Joey, this is Fala. - This is her home. - Hi, I'm Josephine. - Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. Oh. Oh. All right, come on, bitch. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You want it to have power. You're right, Fala. Is this like a secret bar or somethin'? Well, um, actually, this place is usually pretty quiet, but some of our friends are getting married, so it's about to get wild. You want to go to that too! I do, but, girl, it's just the way how we gotta do this. 'Sup, Reggie? Hi, guys. Hello. Can I have two whiskeys? Don't worry. We don't bite. Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. Ah. How was that? Good. This is crazy. But do you work here? No, um, I work for Sal and Fala. We help people get out of bad relationships, get off the street, um, teach self-defense classes. Stuff like that. All right, bitches! It's time for Hexus! Whoo! Make some fuckin' noise! On the count of three, follow me. Yo, ready?

Hey. - I gotta run an errand. You want to come with? - Yeah. What is all of this stuff? Careful. This is a pin camera, okay? It records video, audio, basically makes secrets not so secret. Right. Hey, let's go. What did she say? Oh, uh, she said that you're a good dancer. Oh. Thank you. Yeah, we're goin' back there. You got it. Hey, will you wait here? Babushka's kind of weird with new people. Yeah. Babushka, we're comin' in! Don't shoot, Babushka. It's Regina and Beatrice. Let's go, Babbo. Hey, Babbo. I'll tell you right now, this stuff was not easy to come by. My cardigan? I like your, um... all your patches. You're wild, Babbo. Okay, we gotta go. Let's go. I'd tell you to be careful with that stuff, but it only affects the Y chromosome. You girls have a good trip. We will, Babbo. - And be sure and pull over if you're gonna sleep. - We will, Babbo! If you stop by Milfred Farm, pick me up some of that strawberry moonshine. - We will, Babbo! - We will, Babbo! One, two, three. Crazy cat. You want anything? - No, thanks. - Yup. I'm good. I'm gonna take a leak. Unfucking real! You're gonna embarrass me like that. Are you fucking serious? Huh? Hey! Look at me, you fucking drunk! Jesus Christ, you're sloppy! Maybe you made your point, yeah? Nobody asked you, soul sister. Doesn't seem like she's arguing much. She's not arguing because she's a fucking idiot. Lucky I don't smack her in the mouth. Honestly, you're lucky I don't smack you in the fucking mouth. I'd like to see you try. Fucking bitches! Tonight's your lucky night, asshole. We're giving away free etiquette lessons. Next time you gotta pay up. You need a ride? Well, I think we deserve a shot. Um, hey, do you think that what just happened was, like, bad? - You guys are not gonna believe what fuckin' happened. - What happened? I don't know. I'm like kinda shaken up. It feels weird. I don't think that there's anything weird about making men like that feel unsafe. What if the police find out? You think he's gonna go to the cops and tell them that he got beat up by a bunch of girls? Come here. Listen, she doesn't belong here and you know it, okay? So I think we should just send her home and move on. Dude, what is your problem? What? Who is Tommy Collin? He is this fucking ruthless fuckboy we went to school together with. What's my problem? She doesn't fucking belong here, dude. Nobody fuckin' belongs here. That's the whole fucking point. He just threw me on the ground. I feel like we've all paid our dues. We belong here... Paid our dues. What does that even... He was much more graphic. We went to school together. Smacked him in the fucking mouth with a bar flashlight. Knocked out four of his fuckin' teeth. And then, like, it was denial and embarrassment, and anger, then disgust. Angie, we've been together since foster care. You know, we travel around the world, fuckin' shit up. - Ain't takin' no names. - Da-da-da-da. What are you sayin' about me over there, sis? I'm sayin' that I got the beauty and the brains. Oh, that's okay, but I got the fuckin' right hook. Don't you forget it. Turn that shit up! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Can I make you some breakfast? Well, Regina seems to have taken quite a liking to you. She told me about last night. You all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Did the violence upset you? I, well, freaked out and froze. I wanted to help, but... Violence can be paralyzingly intense. You were rightfully scared. I guess. But the girls weren't. They just stepped right up. But you'd, uh, call the cops next time? They aren't gonna do nothin'. What'd you say? The cops aren't gonna do anything. Well, I couldn't agree with you more. The girls just knew what to do. I wish I could be like that. You can. Eat up. Uh, thanks for the ride. Are y'all hangin' out later? We leave tonight. Where are you going? It's not all weddings and parties. We got work to do. What kind of work? Kind of like a clean-up-the-streets program. Like last night, but all over the state. Oh. You gotta ask a girl. I'm not gonna make it easy on you. You think I could come? Yeah, I think you could. - I mean I don't wanna intrude. - Shut up. You're not intruding. But just think about it. If you're not cool with what happened last night, we can just hang when I get back. Cool. Okay. Okay, bye. Oh, oh, oh. Just let me... - My seat belt. It was on. - Yeah. Yeah, it was. You said you were attacked by two Black males who mugged you and then smashed your car. That's exactly what happened. You can't smoke in here. The thing is, I don't see it. I see you pinnin' a girl pretty good and then gettin' your ass handed to you, though. See, that... that... that is irrelevant. Those bitches still have to pay for my car. You know that intentionally misleading a police officer is a felony, Mr. Miller. Why don't we call it even? You will hear from my father. Can't wait. Hey, Grandma. Uh, I just wanted to let you know I am goin' away for the weekend. Um, I'm goin' camping with my new friends. So we're just taking anyone with us? Look, she doesn't know the protocols, Regina. She's gonna get somebody killed. But I didn't want you to worry. I'm in good hands. I love you. - You look great. - Thanks. - Yeah, I'm glad you came. - Me too. Yeah. Hey. You seem like a smart girl. This is not a holiday. - All right? - Mm. So if you're gonna be here, you're gonna contribute. You will be counted on. All right. Thanks, Sal. Ever since we were little kids, I've always been better and I'm always gonna be better. Okay, shit-talker. - Exactly. Get your ass, let's go. - Yeah, whatever! Let's... It's that time of the year again. We're hittin' the road tonight. Now, the target of our focus this year, MFM, Men's First Movement. Was your standard group of passive fascists, but they have recently become involved in a series of hate crimes and various assaults. Now, the leader is Mark Vanderhill. You wanna know what we think about your sensitive politics and these issues, yeah? Fuckin' that's what we think! Mark Vanderhill began his illustrious career four years ago as an online pickup artist under the name Arc Angel. And we're back, fellas. Back... Back... Back, fellas. Six months after his show on DH1 was canceled, Mark unveils his new blog, The Master's Burden, in which he has undergone not just a physical makeover but a seemingly ideological one as well. Consent politics. I mean, fuck. Have we all become faggots out here, fellas? 'Cause here's what I know. You see it, you want it, you take it. That's what the MFM is really all about. You know, you hear these libtards talk about safe spaces. They don't really understand what that means. This is a safe space. Mark became an alt-right icon and formed MFM after a successful series of lectures entitled "The Necessity of Dominance." That's the way we've done it for thousands of years, and there's nothing wrong with that. That's natural. That's an expression of dominance. Every species on the planet does it. The male exerts dominance over the female. It's fucking science! The way you gotta work with the gun. You do it quick in a satisfying way. Same way I've always talked about with women. Can't be too gentle with them. You gotta make sure they understand how you wanna use them. And of course, we expect them to fight back because it wouldn't be any fun if they didn't. That's your fuckin' head! Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker. You've never even been outside of this town before, have you? I mean, my aunt lives in Philadelphia. Just stay the fuck out of my way. Their increased militarization has been cause for concern. The MFM has some of the best shooters in the world. He has had notable association with mass shootings. Whoa! Fuck, yeah! He's also linked to the bomber at the Ogden abortion clinic. That's what we're fuckin' talking about. You see that? All investigations have mysteriously ceased. Perfect. Seems like he might be gettin' a little help from the inside. The MFM is hosting a rally in Littleson. Littleson is the hub of human trafficking in this nation. It is a town run by a deeply corrupt police force, the head of which is Chief David Morill. Now, that would be him. Now, he's a very dangerous man. It's so goddamn dark out here. Hmm. Thanks. Wait, she can hear perfectly? Lily? Yeah, totally. She won a singing competition when she was younger, released a whole bunch of songs, got semi-famous. One guy in particular kept sendin' her stuff. Eventually, he started asking her a bunch of weird shit. So she rejected him, and then six months later, he showed up to one of her shows, knocked her unconscious, sprayed lighter fluid up her nose and down her throat and set her on fire. Holy fucking shit. Yeah. In court, he said something along the lines of, "If she's not gonna sing for me, she's not gonna sing for anyone." I, uh... I won't tell her that you told me that. I wouldn't have told you if I didn't know it was okay. Right. And you? How did you, uh... How'd you end up here? My stepfather murdered my mother. And I couldn't forgive him. Marney. Here, sir. Bring the truck around. Gotta go check something. Yeah. Time to hit the streets. What? We're not hittin' anything, okay? Just bring the truck around. - Just go get the truck. - Right. Where are we? Put your gun down, Marney. I'm in my legal right to put down a pair of trespassers. We're not here for you, Fala. You got some balls showin' up here. Fala, these MFM guys are complete psychos. And they're in deep with the police. Nice seeing you, Vernon. You know, a while back, federal office suspected that cops in Littleson are runnin' a human trafficking ring. They sent an agent undercover, and she was a tactically trained field officer. She turned up missin' a head. I ain't willin' to let that happen to Sal, even if you are. All right? Oh, my God. Shit. Yo, don't say anything. Just stay calm. Let Beatrice do the talking. Black folks get killed talking back to the police around here. How're we doin' today, ladies? Good. What are you ladies up to? Just goin' on a road trip. Oh, yeah? Where to? I asked you ladies a question. I'm sorry, Officer, but, um, you haven't explained why you stopped us. I mean, you didn't just pull us over because you saw two Black women driving? A lot of drugs coming through here. You, uh, mind if I call... State law says an officer may not detain a motorist for a period of time longer than reasonably necessary to complete the investigation of a violation. But you may not detain us while you wait for additional officers to arrive. You ladies watch your back now. Know your rights. Oh, my God, that was incredible. How did you know that? My grandfather was a district court judge. Sounds like a smart man. He was a complete and utter cocksucker. I thank the stars every day that cancer ate his brain and every pedophilic thought in it. So, what are we doing? - Police work. - Right. But we're out of Guthrie, so we don't have any jurisdiction here, so... We're keepin' the people that live in our jurisdiction safe, even if they go outside of our jurisdiction. Even if they continually make questionable decisions that put themselves and others in danger. Okay, yeah. That's... That's much clearer. Thanks. Tensions are high after disciplinary hearings at NCU led to a unanimous decision of non-conviction by the disciplinary board. The case at hand was based off of claims of sexual assault and rape made against the NCU chapter of the Pi Iota Gamma house. The claim was made after this photograph surfaced. Members of the student body were protesting - as soon as the decision came in. - We need to call Sal. Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma! Clean it up! What the fuck you gawkin' at? Clean it up! Today, justice was served. After three long months of bullshit persecution and slander, those fuckin' admin faggots finally learned a lesson that we have all known for a long time! You can't stop Pi Gam! Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma! We're 24 miles away from that. You know anyone over there? Rudy lives in the next town over. They're the ones that sent the video to Lily. We're not just gonna let this go, right? We can't be everywhere. You know that. Come on, Beatrice. You know that shit was fucked up. Look at what these boys are doin' to girls out... ...complaints of sexual assault and rape. ...complaints of sexual assault and rape. All right, enough. We go, we talk to Rudy... And we help. I spoke to three different girls. The photo in the news was just the tip of the iceberg. Apparently, these guys film everything. They have a room in the house called "the vault." It's reinforced and it has its own security system. This is it. Distract and retrieve. No, no, no. You would have to find a way of bypassing the house's security system. Lily. All right, girls... we're gonna have to move fast. Regina and I will take lead. I think Joey should roll with me. I mean, college kids. She'd be perfect. Regina, she... But she doesn't know... I was asking Sal. I can do it. - Okay. - Hey, I wanna do it. Fine. Let's go pick out some clothes. Beatrice tells me you're going after MFM? Sal, those aren't some frat boys. The cops, this whole town... Grayson says people go missing there all the time. Sal, I'm always gonna have your back, but you need to know this destruction, the violence, you know it's gonna come back to you. It always does. You're just gonna have to trust me. We need to get invited inside. - Hi! - Hi! They're frat boys, so this shouldn't take much. We were touring the campus and we heard that this is the house to party at. So, we were just wondering if you guys wanted to throw down. We got... We got all... We got the other floors, got a bedroom and a bed. - Oh, wow! - Um, you know. I did that. I put the bras up there. - I love that chandelier. - Yeah, it's, like, arty. I brought some of my uncle's moonshine, you guys. To you all getting everything that you deserve in life. - I'll take that! - Yeah. - Take that! - Cheers! I'm so fucked up. Oh, my God. I know! Um, can I use your bathroom? What the fuck? How do you, like, chug a beer? Back it. Open the throat up. - Show me. - Okay, open the throat. - You know all about that, right? - I do. Like that? Oh, my God, he's gonna beat you. He's gonna beat you. Loser! Jett. Motherfucker. Come on. Let's go. Sleep well. Damn, Bea. Warn a bitch! Where's Lily? Joey, n... Lily! I'm sorry about this. Lily! Okay. Go, go, go, go! Did you check the statewide banner like I asked? Yeah. No sign of what you told me to look for. Sure? Yeah, only three crimes have been reported for female perpetrators in the last two hours. Uh, however, no signs of "groups of women committing revenge crimes in a big group." You wrote "group" twice. Which is fine. Reports of an explosion in 2236 Connor Drive. A group of women reportedly fleeing the scene in a truck in a big group. That's half a mile from here. I haven't worn a dress in a minute. - I kinda like it. - Yeah? I mean, I've never had a reason to wear something like this, but... - I'll be right back. - Okay. Thank you. - There was an explosion reported... - You see this shit? ...at the Pi Iota house. Many students are claiming that karma is responsible for the blaze. However, arson is believed to be at play. So the question remains: What does the face of karma actually look like? - Nice. - Yeah. Hey, Sal. And let's not forget that I almost lost a fucking hand getting some of that intel. No, I know that, and you know I don't give a fuck about the money. I just don't want you to get hurt. That's it. Come here. Yeah, good work. But we need to keep goin'. We need to get to Cuzzo's joint. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ! Hello. Hi, is this Mark Vanderhill? Who's this? This is Sheriff Vernon Oakwood. Oh. Right, well, that's not uncommon. Can I ask what you think that has to do with me? Okay. Well, look, I understand you know her, but you clearly don't know me! 'Cause if you knew anything about me, you'd know that I don't cancel events for activist fuck-rags. Let me explain something to you. I can't cancel an event just because a woman has it out for me. Okay? Do you know who I am? Do you have any fuckin' idea how many women have it out for me? So, listen, tell your friend, who you know so well, that if she wants to come and learn the necessities of dominance, I'd be happy to teach her. Hello? Morill! That was an out-of-town sheriff sayin' there's some feminists who want to attack my event. I'd like you to be there. I need additional protection. Not just fuckin' Alistair. Phone call must have really spooked you, huh? Do I need to remind you that the whole reason why your operation is even functional is because I told the mayor... Officer Grumm, take that bitch to the boat before she dies out here. Yes, Chief. Let the boys know they can take off once you get her on board. Then take this bitch to his circle jerk. It's not a circle jerk, all right? It's a very important Men's First meeting. I expected more unity from my brothers, okay? Men First! Redneck. I don't see him. Hold on. Hold on there. What y'all doin' here? We're here to see Cuzzo. Well, well, well! The Mad Maxines find themselves in need of a little help from their friends. Well, you know, we must really be in trouble if the only help we can get is from the Little Rascals. Always talkin' shit. How're you, Sal? Lily's hurt. Boys, show our guest where the medical supplies are. Hi, I'm Joey. Anthony. They call me "Cuzzo." - Cool. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Um, do you all live here? About two years now. After the floods came, this whole area was abandoned. We've been here ever since. Uh, who takes care of you guys? - What? - Don't let age fool you. These are capable, smart boys. We grow our own food. We make money salvagin' materials and such. I learned how to survive for five years from Sal and Fala. - Hmm. - I gotta say I'm impressed. I am. It's a lot better than a group home. Yeah, that's the idea. Yo, fellas! Let's get the table ready for dinner tonight. I came up with the queer pop all-star squad. Oh, my God. You're obsessed. Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor, Clarice, all the Disney villains... Ursula, Jafar, all of them. Gandalf, Sherlock Holmes and Harriet the Spy. Don't forget Curious George and the little white children of Narnia. Oh, my God! Hey. Um, my friend thinks you're pretty. Aw! You're gonna give those boys a heart attack. Fellas, pull up! So may you eat well tonight, and if you do ever need us, we'll be there for you. Now let's eat! He knows about Littleson. He seems concerned, even for him. It's possible we may have underestimated the situation. Vernon knows where we're going. - Who's Vernon? - He's a cop. Why are we going to Littleson? 'Cause that's where Sal's goin'. Who's Sal? Who's Sal? I'm gonna tell you something, - but I don't wanna hear another word about it, okay? - Yeah. I was graduatin'. I was gettin' ready to go to the academy. She'd already graduated. She was so fuckin' smart. And we had a thing. He was very charming, and he was very handsome, and, shit, I grew quite fond of him. And so I asked her to marry me. - Where? - What? Where did you ask her to marry you? On a Ferris wheel. That's romantic. I said yes, like an idiot. I had no fucking clue what I wanted. You were in love. Yeah. Well... I got pregnant. He was thrilled. I was not. We fought about it. I did what I had to do. He went and told my family, who promptly disowned me. We never did get married. I met Fala instead. - You still love her, don't you? - Don't... - What? - Don't. You're gonna give me advice. - Just don't. - Sure. Sure. I get it. Lockin' it up. It's... - Just one thing, though. I... - Nope, nope. I could say this doesn't matter, but it does. Now, if any of you wanna quit... now would be the time to talk. All right. I hope my nana's okay. I am so excited to see you all here tonight! Whoo! - Here's the man we've been waiting for. - Yeah! Gentlemen and gentlemen, Mr. Mark Vanderhill! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! - Men first! Men first! - Soldiers. Brothers. Okay, so not only am I very excited to see all these familiar faces here, but I'm also even more thrilled maybe to see some of the new faces I see out here, right? Faces of people who... who wanted to be here, who wanted to be here, but were afraid to make their faces known! I know about that fear. That's what I wanna talk about today. A lot of you might know me from the Vanderhill Files, if we've got any Fanderhills in the building. When I was a young man, I was actually a very sad, very lonely kid. I was rejected, teased by my peers. I was ignored by women who... You know what they do. They say they want one thing, ultimately maybe they want another thing. I was rejected by a culture that, as I've grown older, I've just watched it become crazier and crazier and more and more emasculated. A culture in which every woman and minority is a superstar by default. Regardless of their behavior. No more insults, right? No more slurs. That's what they say. But somehow, these certain words are approached with more and more anger, right? No slurs, but we've got these words now, like, uh, I don't know... Straight? - Yeah. - Yeah. I don't know. White? Yeah. - Man? - Yeah! Dirty words. Now, I don't know if y'all here are men of religion or science. It doesn't matter. You and I, we know. We are men. We're men! We're men! I'm not gonna be sorry for that anymore! I'm not gonna be sorry for being white! I'm not gonna be sorry for being straight! We brought this civilization out of chaos. We founded this country on our backs, and now, at the 11th hour, with the work already done, now they want a seat at the table. Now they want us to give up power willingly into the hands of people who, I'm sorry, are incapable of wielding it. Well, brothers... brothers, let me say... Over my dead body. Over my dead body! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! Men first! Hey, y'all fellas. You may notice the room may be gettin' a bit hazy. But don't worry about your lungs. This stuff won't kill you. It isolates chromosomes in human DNA that are meant for reproduction. Bobby, we got a little technical something. Making it an effective sterilizing agent for male primates. It shuts down cardio flow to your penis. Side effects may include no more erections ever again. What the fuck is that? Alistair, Alistair! What the fuck is that? So you don't have to interact with women anymore. Yeah. No more crying. - No more makeup. - No more periods. Ew! So, remember, boys, be nice. Hey, be ready to fly out of here. As soon as Bea shows, we're gone. Yeah, baby! There's nothin' I love more than watching grown men squeal. Watch out! Come on, Bea, come on! - I will fuck you, bitch! - Come on, Bea! - I will fuck you! - We gotta go! You know, sometimes you gotta stop and smell the flowers. Come on, Bea. Are you crazy? You just sterilized a room full of men! What more do you want? I'm talking to you! Fuck! We don't have time for this! Come on! Come on! Bea, get in the fucking truck! Get in the car! Joey, go! Are you out of your mind? - What is wrong with you? - We're on the same team. Just drop it! - No! - Bea, you were makin' a play that you didn't tell anyone about. Oh, of course, you rush to defend your new friend, Regina. - Oh, God! - Don't worry about how many times I saved - your fucking life or anything. - Shut up! - You are such a hypocrite! - You are out of your league, bitch! - Everything I have is because of me. - So what? - You... You were just gonna... You were gonna rape that man? - It's accountability, okay? And no one's gonna give it to us, so we have to take it. - Even if that means playing dirty sometimes. - It is not the same thing. I can tell it's hard for you to wrap your head around the fact that we can't always talk shit out. So sometimes you just gotta fuck somebody up. Yo, bro, chill! Hey, fuck. Shit. Joey! Ah, fuck. Hey. We're exposed out here. We need to get to Cuzzo's. Come on. What are we doing? We're doin' what no one else will. And, yo, you're not wrong about Beatrice. She does fucked-up shit. But she comes from fucked-up shit. And I'm glad that you called her out. I'm sick of fuckin' doin' it myself. Ow! Watch it. No. I told you. It was four Black ones and, like, an Arab. I'm sorry. I'm not sure I know who you are. Vernon Oakwood. I'm the sheriff of Guthrie. Guthrie? You're quite a ways from home. - Just followin' up on a couple of things. - You're the guy who called me. The one who told me to cancel. I heard about that. You seemed concerned about some vigilantism? That's right, I was, but I don't know. You made that call, and now you're here, a moment after a terrorist attack. Why don't you tell us what you do know? - Just followin' a hunch. - What's her name? Doesn't really seem like her MO. People change. - Well... - Don't you worry. We take care of our loose ends around here. If she had somethin' to do with this, she's gonna be in a body bag before sundown. I was tracking them through the surveillance cams. Fifty miles from here. One cam, five miles down the road. He's fuckin' full of shit. I want you to arrest him. I want you to arrest him right now. Listen, I know you got some big-shot pride, but you raise your voice to me again, I'll kill you where you stand. Get me some traffic footage from every direction. Yes, Chief. Been a long couple of days, huh? I'm ready to go home. You don't have to explain. When I first met Regina, she was only 12 years old. She'd already killed a man. At this point, Regina is so used to this life, she doesn't even consider if this is what she wants anymore. Asking yourself what you want, listening to that and doin' what is right for you. It's what makes you strong. We all understand betrayal. For some of us, it was a system. Maybe it was our families. Could have been a stranger. Maybe it was an old friend. We all know why we're here. Did I tell you or didn't I tell you? Yeah, right here somewhere. Whoo-hoo! Black attack! Come on, let's go! Boys, move. Come on, come on. - We gotta go. We gotta go. - Come on. Come on. Boys, move! It's time to move! Let's go! Come on! Boys, get everythin' together! Okay, now listen. You stay with the girls and you get home. - All right? - Yeah. - You got it? - All right, all right. Come on, come on, come on. Get the bags. Take this one. Petey, you got your backpack? - Move to the front. Come on! - Get these boys right out of here. No matter what. What are you doin' here? You still look good. - You look like hell. - Yeah. I'm in better shape than you are, though. Deranged lunatic Morill's tryin' to find you. You came a long way for a heads-up. You really think that they're gonna let you walk away from this? These guys are professional murderers, Sal. They're comin' for your blood. All right, let me take you in. I'll get you to a... get you a cell, get you safe. It's better than a morgue. My knight in shinin' armor comin' to save my neck by choppin' off my head. You can hate me all you want, all right, just... Oh, I never hated you, dummy. I just wanted you to ask me how to help instead of telling me how you're gonna do it. You really haven't changed a bit. - I can control the situation. Just trust me. - Hey! It's over. They're coming! How can I help you? You still shoot that pistol? Get down on the ground, or we will kill you! Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know what she meant to you. Yeah. You know, I do what I wanna do no matter what. And... it's not always cool. I was completely out of line back there, and you were right to have stopped me. What are you gonna do? Take the boys to the Bomb. Talk to Fala. Figure out what the next step is. Yeah, we'll lead the way. No, no, we can't go back there. Beatrice, we don't have time for this, okay? - We don't have time for this? What do you... - Beatrice is right. Regina, the man that killed Sal, we gotta take him down. War is upon us. Today will go down in history as the beginning of the end for those who seek to destroy what we have worked so hard to build, these important and critical structures of power. Now, I'm on my way to convene with some of my most trusted brothers on our best course of action going forward. To my followers, to my soldiers, know this. Victory in this war will be both bloody and sweet. Know that I am personally coming for you. Fuck! Fuck! How the fuck did we let this happen? After the chemical weapon was released, we tracked the suspects to a nearby junkyard with our fellow officers from Guthrie, who, I am sad to say, have both been shot and killed by these maniacs. We were, however, successful in taking down the terrorist cell. All the women responsible for the attack in Littleson have been killed. That's all I can share for now. I bet you my boots they're gonna try to find me. So get out to the boat, make sure everything's still on schedule. I think you're gonna find this was a big mistake. I'll be there in an hour. I got two more to load up before the boat heads out. You should have stuck to frat boys and catcallers. What are you gonna do to us? Kill you? Nah. Ten grand a head, you're worth more alive. Might have some fun with you before I send you packin'. Really, you're just a fucking hired gun. Power is defined by the storyteller. If my boat full of women makes it from San Marco to Mexico, I'll be rich. That boat gets intercepted, I'll be the hero. Call me whatever you like. Nobody cares what some Black cunt said. They care what I say. You see, I can turn a missing mother of four into a dangerous prostitute who's abandoned her children. I can turn the heroin that I bought into the reason why we shoot up a car full of spics. I'm the storyteller! I can make you moan like the whore you are. What do you say, Joey? Enough for a conviction? Yeah. Say cheese, motherfucker. - Get off me! - Hey! Like you said, they won't believe us, but there's no way they won't believe you. Fala said the video's going crazy on the Net. Yo, look at all this shit. What the fuck? These are ID's of 20 different missing women. I like to keep trophies. Gettin' your dick wet is one thing, but takin' something from someone that they don't wanna give you, well, that's really special. - What the fuck? - Joey, don't. Someone took it from you, didn't they? I saw that same fear in your friend's eyes. She looked scared when she died. Let's give you a fair shot. You ain't got it no more, old man. Take him down. We should go. Not me. What? Come on. You have to come with us. Come on. - I can't. - No, you... No, I can't. Baby! I didn't even know you were here! Mmm. Mmm. Oh. Baby, what's wrong? Nothin'. It's just good to see you. How you feelin'? Better. - Pop. - Hey. Hey, you know somethin'? I walked two miles every day while you were gone. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. Two. I got some of this brown sugar butter. You're gonna love it. After breakfast, we can walk to the store. You won't believe how they've changed some of the stuff. Oh, and some of the people... Joey. - Can I come in? - Uh, yeah, yeah. Uh, can I get you somethin' to drink? It's good to see you, Joey. I've been, uh... I've been meaning to... to call you. What'd you wanna talk to me about? Nothing. I just wanted to let you know that I was gonna be pretty busy the next few weeks. It's gonna be hard to hang out. Oh, you thought I wanted to hang with you again? No, I was not assuming that. I just... I just wanted to... to touch base. Oh, relax. That's not why I'm here. All right. Um... What's... What's goin' on? I've just been thinking about the last time we hung out. You know, the details, they're, uh, a little foggy. Yeah? Uh, which part? Well, I remember getting to the party. I remember hanging out and laughing. I remember you were being so sweet and... ...encouraging. - And then, I don't know, that's when... - You know what, Joey? I have a phone call for a big interview that I really wanna get. It's in, like, five minutes. Mike. Would you like me to leave? What if I said no? What would you do if I said no? Oh, come on, you did it. You can say it. I raped you. You raped me. Did you think if you never admitted it that it never happened? That if you left it out of your story, it would be erased from mine? Silencin' the truth doesn't mean it isn't there. Doesn't mean it goes away. And it doesn't let you off the hook for what you did. You raped me, Mike. But you don't get to tell my story. I do. So I'm gonna tell it right. And don't forget. I will be watching. So be good now. - Speaking of the news... - Yes. Oh, my God, those girls in the... I've been following this on the news since the beginning. I'm just gonna start talking, 'cause I don't really know where to start. What those ladies did was absolutely acceptable. Honestly, I don't feel bad for a second for what happened. We live experiencing violence all the fucking time. And nobody cares. And I'm so glad that these girls are finally doing something about it. As a survivor of sexual assault, I've been told my whole life that I can't be angry. You're gonna sit back and take it? There's no accountability. The system has yet to protect me. The system has yet to do anything about what happened to me. Those girls in that town, they were like... They finally did something about it. Taking the law into their own hands. Gives me permission to feel everything that up until now I've been told I shouldn't feel. So they destroyed a little property. Wait, but where do I sign up to join the girl game? Women are standing up for themselves. - Is that worse than what the boys were doing? - Nope. Passive resistance is no longer an option. And the death of that sheriff means that things are actually gonna change. - We have had enough. - Yeah, we had enough. - Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! - Fuck men, yeah! I'm just fuckin' thrilled that there's a whole new generation of badass women out there. Those fuckers got what they deserved. This time, you're paying the price. It's inspiring that people are standing up finally. - Yeah. - Hopefully it will lead to some sort of change. Those cocksuckers deserved it.
