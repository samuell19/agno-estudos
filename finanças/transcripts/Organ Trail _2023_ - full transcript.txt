Tobias! Tobias! That"s okay. There we go. You"re okay, right? Tobias! Tobias! Tobias. Here, hold it down! Yes, sir! Where"s your sister? She"s fetching what she can from the well. We can distill our drinking water from the snow. Hitch up Fable and go fetch her. Time is wasting. Yes, sir. We have to go. It"s too early for a storm like this. We"ve held as long as we can. We have to get off this mountain or we"ll starve. Freeze or starve? It seems the Lord has forsaken us. He is testing us. And the children? The Lord be a capricious fiend if he tries the helpless. Hush, Mother! We can brave the storm. We"ll be safe in the valley. We should never have come here. Abigale! Abigale! Abigale! You know better than to venture beyond the path at night. I just wanted to... What is snow made of? Water. You are not to wander out of my sight without your Pa or Tobias. Is that understood? Yes, ma"am. Finish stowing the wagon so we can leave this horrid place. Have faith in your father. He will get us off the mountain. Have faith. Have faith. We must have faith that our suffering has a reason and that by the grace of God we will be delivered. "Blessed is the one who endureth these trials. For having stood the test, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised those who persevere in love. And you shall pass through the river, but the water will not wash over you. And you shall walk through the fire, but you shall not be burned. No, the flames will not set you ablaze, for always as you walk, I am with you." "Consider it pure joy, brothers and sisters, when you face diverse trials, for these trials worketh patience and compassion. Let patience and compassion have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing." We got out from underneath the storm. Why have we stopped? He"s no spring colt. He"ll drop from exhaustion, we push him too hard. This is a good place to camp. Tobias. You scout ahead. Make sure there"s not a better spot to set up camp. If you don"t object. I don"t. Abigale. Stay here, gather snow for water. You mind your work, girl. There"s no need to court misfortune. Well... How many we got left? Only need one. Right. Can I load it? There you go. Yeah. Ah, tamp it. Slowly. We can"t risk it jamming up on us. Easy. Good. Good. Can I go? Your place is here, sweetheart. We won"t be long. Goddamn it! What are you standing around for? Go after him while I reload. Yes, sir. You might"ve got her! Quiet, boy. They could still be here. Shh. We"re not gonna hurt you! We"re not gonna hurt you. Shh. Miss. Miss. Shh. Miss, we"re on your side. Miss, it"s not safe. You have to be quiet. Quiet. Shh. Shh. Tobi... Tobias. Yeah. Snap off the arrow, huh? What? No, no. No! No! No! Shh. I saw some moss. A few of the trees when we came in. Go. Collect as much as you can. Go, go. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And get two thin branches. Go. Got you. Okay. All right. Shh. Hey, hey, hey. None of that, none of that. Stay awake. What"s your name? What"s your name? Cassidy. I"m Abraham. Do you know what happened? You have family elsewhere? You"re welcome to join my family. We"re gonna take... We"ll take... We"ll take you somewhere safe. Here. Strip the bark from the wood. Yes, sir. What... What... What are you doing? What are you doing? I have nothing to stitch your hand with. All right. All right. Hold steady. Breathe. Breathe deep, breathe deep. Breathe deep. Tobias. It"s ready. Moss. Okay. Take two sticks and place "em on both sides of her arm. Yes, sir. Okay. Put "em in her coat. Put "em in her coat. Hold them there. Yeah, hold them. Hold them, but keep "em tight. Yes, sir. Oh! Okay. All right. Brace yourself, Cassidy. This is gonna hurt. Where did you learn to do that? I was a medic during the war. We had to make do with whatever we had. Let"s finish the job. Okay. Fetch a needle and thread, Mother. Mama! Quickly! Oh, God. What on earth? Here. Clear out that chair. What happened to her? She, uh... She was... Her party, uh... Tobias found her camp. She"s lucky to be alive. Mother, where"s the thread? I... Mother. I got it. We couldn"t abandon her. No, of course not. I don"t think they"re infected. Not yet, at least. We"ll know come dawn. Tobias, finish the hunt. Yes, sir. You did well today. You ready? I got you. I got you. Yep. I got you. It"s all right, Miss. You"re safe. Pa will take good care of you, I promise. There, there. There, there now. There. There now. All right. I got you, I got you. There. There now. Hold it still. I got you... I got her. Hold it still. I got you. I got you. All right. All right, all right. That"s it. That"s it, honey. That"s it, honey. Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah? Yeah. All right. Okay. Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me, dear. It"s almost done. Stay with me. Stay with me. There now. There now. Abigale, help her in the wagon. You"re safe with us. None of us are. We need to be gone before daybreak. Whoever attacked her might still be close by. You could"ve led them right to us. No one was around as far as I could see. We couldn"t just leave her there. There"s barely enough food to feed ourselves, let alone a stray. This was all you could find? It"s something, Abraham. We must"ve lost the ammunition at the other camp. And you caught these how? I made a snare. Like you taught me. I"ll brine it overnight. Do you need help? No, it won"t take long. You rest. You"ve done too much today. I"ll take the man. You take the woman. Hey. Hey. Don"t you touch her. Don"t you touch her. Don"t touch her. Darling, I"ve missed you. ♪ How turns the glass Around ♪ ♪ For shame ye bore Tell yourself ♪ ♪ How stands the glass Around ♪ ♪ Let mirth and wine Abound ♪ ♪ The trumpets sound... ♪ Brody! Shut the fuck up! You don"t think I have a good singing voice? I"ve been told I have the voice of an angel. Ooh! What motherfucker told you that? Well, funny enough, it was your mother.

Oh, Rhys, there"s no reason for you to be upset. If anything, I"m the one who should be upset. Yeah? Why is that, Logan? Because I thought I was the only one fucking your mother. Whoo! Gentlemen, enough. We"ve crossed a line. Apologies, Rhys. And since you are new here, I"d like to gift you this song. Brody! ♪ The trumpet sounds ♪ ♪ The colors They do fly, me boys ♪ ♪ To fight, kill, or wound ♪ Let"s skin the rabbit. Ooh! All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy! What say you?

Thomas Jefferson himself never drank its like. Brody? Dang! Well said. And in this hand, a more recent Saint-EÉmilion, a Merlot. Redolent of blackberry, spice, vanilla and jam. Both bottles liberated from their oppressors! Whoo! En route across our territory! Whoo! To the San Francisco boomtown. Felix? It"s real good. Thank you. Here, my friend. Take both. They"re each worth about $40. Whoo. Enjoy. Don"t know why we"re celebratin". Anything good? Shit and more shit. Hey! Get your hand out of there. We could probably get something for the horse. She"s worth more as glue.Yeah. There"s only one thing in this camp worth a shit, and that shit belongs to Logan. God, it"s good to have you back. It"s good to be warm. They was decent folk. Most would"ve just put me out of my misery. Is that what you want? You know it"s not. After last time, who knows what I know about you. But they... Let me fix that for you. If you hadn"t tried to run, we wouldn"t have had to do that to you. If you try and run again... it"ll be much worse, savvy? Yes. Oh! Oh! You didn"t bring me all the way here just to shoot me. I wouldn"t waste a bullet on you. Mmm. Hey. Leave her out of this. You were about her age when you started. The way I see it, you can show her the way we do things around here. Or I can put you both out of my misery. Hmm? Okay! Okay. Okay. Hey. Just don"t hurt her. Holster my guns. Don "t drop " em. Mmm. If Logan catches you, he"ll kill us both. You brought me here. Help me. Them boys out there aren"t so bad. Just do what they want, you"ll be okay. And what do they want? To whore me out? No, nothing like that. Then what? Get folks to stop on the road, take me in. It was you. You don"t know what you"re talking about... My family"s dead because of you! I never killed no one. Fuck you! I saved your life. I wish you"d just killed me instead! You don"t mean that. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Go! Where"d you get that? Ah, found it. Stole it, more like. We"re thieves. Practicing. How come you"re not wearing gloves? Don"t that hurt? No. Well, why in the hell not? All right, all right. Okay. What you doing, man? What the fuck you doing, man? Watch this. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Cut it out! Stop it! Quit it, man. Stop! You"re fucking crazy, man! I don "t feel nothin". I"ve been that way my whole life. Doctors got no explanation for it. I don "t feel nothin". This trade here, I learned in the workhouse. I work. You "re just takin" up space. I got my uses. Yeah, tippin" that bottle ain"t useful. Fuck you. I"m good. I "m just waitin" on Logan, then. Why don"t you make yourself useful, let him know. Not you. Hey, I"m talking to you, Brody. Now. Put your fuckin" britches on. I "m comin" in. Y"all decent? Aw, fuck. Y"all is decent. I was hoping you"d be in mid-orgy or some shit. What... What is that you call it? Uh... A ménage à trois? "Menagerie de todd!" Someday, maybe. Yes, bonne chance. And please knock before entering from now on. Were you raised in a barn? Yes, sir, I was. The horses are ready. Whenever you are. In a moment. All right. There "s a storm comin" up over the ridge. I"m gonna get my chaps on, get ready. Get the girl ready. She"ll be joining us. She ain"t ready. Well, she"ll learn. You did. Put her on the trail, she"s gonna run. She can"t outrun a bullet. Let go of me! Put me down! You motherfucker! Let me go! Stop it! Let me go! Untie me and let me go! You bitch! You see this? You gotta contain yourself, woman. I"m gonna cut your ropes... I think we"ll just keep the ropes on then, shall we? We"ve got business to attend to. Okay? It"s a day away, at least. I don"t like the look of it. We need to keep the storm at our backs. What you thinkin"? You bring the German? Of course. It"s a crossroads next to a split pine. See it? Uh-huh. We can plant the girls there and wait it out further down. Should we do a walk-around first? Nah, it"ll take too long. Get ready. The horses aren"t going to like crossing this ice. Where do you think you"re going, huh? Ah! Oh, God. Oh, for fuck"s sake. Where do you think you"re running? Can no one bring this puckish bitch to heel? Damn it! I"ve had enough of your girlish fuckery for one day! Now stand down, or I don"t know what I"m liable to do! Oh. Hey, grab up the rope! No! Grab the rope! Get the rope! Grab it! Where is she? This is a river. Current"s taking her anywhere downstream. I think downstream is that way. I don"t care if you bring her back as a corpse. That little bitch better be strapped to the ass of your horse by the time the storm blows over, or the last camp I left you at will seem like a matinee at the panto! Huh? My daddy got this in the army. I got it when he died. Felix, no. I... You can give it back when you"re done. You"ll be all right. Come on, Romeo. Get on your horse. You read Shakespeare? What the fuck is Shakespeare? Let"s go. Oh, yeah. There we go. Juniper Christmas! Don "t move! Don"t move! Your sleeve will freeze to the ice. Got a fire right yonder. We can get you warmed up. We need to go now. Soon as we get you warm enough. Now, please! Who you running from? Devils. Come on now. What happened? Fell through some thin ice, I reckon. Just stable Orion. I"ll draw a bath for this one. Get you warmed up in no time. What"s your name? Abigale. Nora. My husband is Erik. Do you have any family we could... They"re all dead. Oh. You could stay with us as long as you need. She was terrified. That"s for sure. Well, where she come from? Can"t have been far. But I didn"t see no smoke, so it"s hard to say. She say how they died? No. What do we do with her? Take her in. The Lord sent you to be her savior. What if the devil sent her to be our demise? Don"t be an old fool. You didn"t see the look in her eyes, Nora. What about that blood you washed from her hair? The current washed most of it away. You find a wound? Just a few lumps and bruises. She can stay with us for a time, but I"d feel better about the situation if we found someone who knows her family. You"re right. Yeah, well, I don"t wanna be. Would you like to stay in longer? I could boil some more water. I don"t want to be a burden. I wouldn"t have offered if it was any inconvenience. You"re with child? Maybe a little. I don"t... Well, Erik and I are happy to have you here safe with us. Mmm. She been gone too long. She ain"t coming back. You don"t know that. That was pretty of you to sacrifice your gun. Least now, it might get some use. Oh, it"s been fired plenty. By who? Your daddy? To hell with you. You even have a daddy? No. You might as well have thrown it in the river. You ain"t ever gonna see it again. Mmm. Logan should"ve slit her throat last time she tried to run. Or did you forget that part already? Even a shitty gun like yours deserves to ride with someone who"d use it. Mmm. Them sure is good. Pardon. Good boy. You remember me, right? Son of a bumble bee. Nora! I done told you, Nora! Brought that girl home. Is she gone? Didn"t I say there was something off about that girl? But she can"t have gone far, not in her condition. She"s taken Orion. You are not going after her. We need that horse, Nora. No, I need you. This. All of this, this is our miracle. We"ve worked too hard not to see it through together. Well, I wouldn"t exactly call it "work," now. You know what I mean. Come here. If I don"t find them in a few hours, I"ll turn back. Promise me. I promise. You do what needs to be done, but don"t you dare leave us alone. Sure enough. I was hoping you"d return. Hey, I"m not gonna hurt you. Look at me. Couldn"t hurt you if I wanted to. Where is my family? What have you done with them? I was afraid you were dead. Come... Come warm yourself by the fire. Please? Why are you doing all this? Why are you here? They sent me out to find you. Bring you back. But I ain"t gonna do that. I"m never going back. And... I don"t know why I done what I done. I... I tried to run away, but then they... they done this to my hands, and... I didn"t know what else to do then. But that don"t matter, "cause... I"m the cause of your suffering. Too much suffering. I ain"t gonna cause no more. You"ll ruin your hands if you don"t let them heal. They"re already ruined. Where"d you find that horse? A rancher pulled me from the water. So, you stole it? Borrowed it. I have every intention of returning him once I get Fable back. Tell me you "re jokin". You"re going back to them fiends for a horse? He"s the only family I got left. That"s suicide. Either way, I"ll end up with my family. We can return after the thaw, if you"d like. Bury "em proper. You"d do that? If you"d let me. Fucking bitch! Stole the arrowheads. I know it. What are you talking about? I made a cache of them before we left. Well, now they"re gone. Why would she steal a bunch of scrap arrowheads? Cause it"s the best proof she"s got! They could lead the law right to us, if she"s turned on us. Felix, saddle up, find Cass and bring her back! I"m doing it. I"ll do it. Sit the fuck down, junior. This is man"s work. Hey, you bring her back alive. If you harm her, I"ll know about it. I won"t harm her any worse than you already have. They"re my arrowheads. I"m doing it. Okay. If you don"t, it"s your neck! Rhys, don"t make it mine! Good evening. Can I get me some of that? I"ll pay if you want. Oh. No trouble. Obliged to you. You walked all the way from Wicker? In the dark? I should"ve charged you for the coffee. Mmm. What you know about these? Not worth the price of the coffee. Not looking to sell them. Asking what you know. Okay. Well, that"s... That"s handmade, so... I only do first-quality stuff here, so thank you, but no, thank you. That"s not what I asked. I don"t know anything about them. And neither do you. Go home, friend. Can I have a look at "em? You know what? I-It"s getting late. I think I"ll... You got a name? To hell with you! Okay. You ain"t got a gun? No. Hey, you stay right there, friend. Hey there. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry. I "m sorry. I"m sorry. This man I just nailed to the bar, who is he? I"ve never seen him before in my life. He owns the Wicker Creek Ranch! I want a name, old man. Sir, I do not know. You ain"t gotta do that. Erik! Erik! His name is Erik! That"s enough, now. He has a pregnant wife! He has a pregnant wife! Thank you. Now, Mr. Erik with the pregnant wife from Wicker Creek Ranch, where"d you get them arrowheads? Where"d you find them? No, no. I... I found them in some trees. They led me here. What are you lookin" for? Could you... Could you not hurt him no more. Please? Tell me what I want to know, and I"ll consider it. M-My horse. She stole my horse. Who? I don"t know! She ain"t never told me her name. No! No! No! No! Good Lord have mercy! Oh! Mr. Erik? Mr. Erik? Looks like you and me"s partners now. Let"s go find your horse. Why don"t you carry a gun, rancher? You lose it? In the war, I done pointed too many a gun at too many men, and, um... just won"t do it no more. Well, that"s a pretty notion. Pretty fuckin" stupid. You see any more? Cassidy, good to see you again. But... you ain"t got the strength to pull that trigger. Do you? Go on, rancher. Fetch. Mm-hmm. Never cared for the Schofield much myself. Too much maintenance. Mmm. Where"s the girl? She never came out of the water. Don"t lie to me. I"m not. Why did you come back here? Give these folks a proper burial. More than you"ve ever done for anyone. They get where they"re going one way or another. Come on. Get on your horse. Let"s go. What? You went through the trouble of stealin" it. We ain"t just leavin" it behind. Don"t give me no trouble now. Ain"t them hands had enough? I was coming back anyhow. I left them arrowheads so I could find my way back. Ain"t no Natty Bumppo. Erik! Erik! Erik! Oh, God. Come on. Oh! Oh, thank God. Yeah, praise him. Maybe not just yet, though. I"m so sorry. Oh. Yeah. My wife said it"d make me look more intimidating to a predator. She"s a smart woman. Sure enough. What did he do to your hand? Nothing nice. Fella got some sort of trademark. This will apply enough pressure to the wound without cutting off circulation. How... How do you know how to do that? My father taught me. Well, he taught my brother, but I watched. You know, you"re lucky you ain"t caught pneumonia yet. You can thank Nora for that. You can thank her yourself. I should"ve never stolen your horse. Why did you? He do this? He was one of them. How many are there? Four to begin with. One"s already dead. So, what you gonna do now? Get our horses back. I can follow their tracks. We should move out before sundown. You"re not going with me. Look here. From this point on, I"m choosing to accompany you and get our horses back. After that, you can make your mind up as to whether or not you want to come back to the ranch with me. Hey, easy, easy. Easy, easy. You ain"t gonna run away no more. Ain"t gonna walk nowhere neither. Leave her. But she"ll freeze. I"m not asking. Go take care of the horses. You"re gonna bleed out if that isn"t treated properly. Yeah, I"ll be all right. Bullshit. That language... You"d rather die of blood loss than see your life out with Nora and your child? I can"t let you go in there alone. I"m not some helpless little girl who can"t fend for herself. Oh, come on. You know that"s not what I meant. What did you mean? We"re walking into a snake pit, but I intend to retrieve what"s ours. So, what we gonna do then? Just wait outside until one of them decides to take the horses for a stroll? For now, we"re gonna rest. Just for a minute. Yeah. She may not be able to run, but she"s still a traitor. Oh, she just needs a little correction every now and again, which I"m happy to supply. That"s not tough enough. She"ll run on us again. What do you want me to do? Cut the bitch"s head off and use it as a knocker at the gate? If you can"t control your own woman, then she"ll get us all killed. Makes me wonder who"s the real bitch here. She"s not the one pushing boundaries now, is she? I"ve always wondered how these things work. You still alive, old man? Fuck you! No, thanks. You ain"t got the equipment for it no more. Hey! Hey, what the hell are you doing? I"m doing what need be done. Now, you either stand with me, or you lie bloody with him. Make your choice. Good boy. And you, old friend... you already made your choice. Die with it. Come here, girl. You see me? Can you see me? You may still have a chance, if you survive the night with me and by my good graces. If you choose to betray me like you did him, well... Do you see him? Do you see him? Good. When he dies, you drag him out back with the rest of the waste. Now"s fine. Oh, no. Goddamn! That"s nasty! Cass? Cass? Here, drink this. Careful. It"s hot. I"ll bring more when I can. Help me. Wait. It"s almost morning. Felix! Felix! Felix! Help me! Help me! Quiet! You okay? Sounds close. Any idea where we are? No. We should wait until dawn so we can see where we"re going. Who says she survives that long? Why won"t you just kill me? Well, you dead ain"t what I want. I don"t belong to no man. You keep telling yourself that. Maybe it"ll come true. Fiery. There"s a guard. He won"t even know I"m there. Are you crazy? We don"t even know how many are in there. I"ll slip in, get our horses, and slip out. Then you can go. I"m not leaving without you. It don"t make sense for us to both go in there. I could use some help with that wall, though. Now, please. What are you doing? What are you doing here? What"s it look like? Take it. We don"t have long. Go get the horses. I"ll meet you at the gate. Go. Go. Thank you. Come here. Okay. It"s okay. Are you ready to go? I"ll be back for you. It"s okay. It"s okay. Almost there. How did Romeo and Juliet end again? I forget. You"re gonna be fine. You"re gonna make it. Take her, and keep her close. She won"t survive in the cold. Take care of her for me. Sure enough. Take this. It"s all I got left. Orion"s still in there. Hold on. We got to get to move on. Now or never. Finally grew a pair, huh? Good boy. Jammed. It"s pretty, but useless. Like you and that whore. Hey. You know how your daddy died? You know? In... In the revolution. Oh. Suffering for his people? My daddy died a hero. Suffering ain"t noble. It"s just suffering. There you go. Good girl. All right. Hey. All right. Hey. Abigale. I know. You know nothin... Don"t you do that to yourself. Nothing good can come from it. I miss them. What were their names? Abraham, Celeste, and Tobias, my brother. They were all I had, and I failed them. No. No, I don"t... I don"t see it that way. Everything I know, I learned from watching my parents, but I never got the chance to do anything for myself. I didn"t mean... I understand. You know, I was... brought up to keep quiet, stay in my place and not make a fuss, and that"s exactly what I did. I let them die. It"s my fault, and there ain"t... nothing I can do to bring them back. And there ain"t nothing I can do to make it up. I can"t be saved. Don"t you start thinking that way now. It wasn"t you who brought this hell down upon your family. I don"t think she did either. She was a prisoner, just like I was intended to be. She saved my life twice. She could"ve let them turn me into whatever it was that they made her be. But she"s got a good heart, deep down. I"m not gonna let her die here. I"m sorry about Orion. Well, I"m just glad the both of y"all safe. I"ll feel better about that once we"re away from this place. There, there, there. How far to the homestead? Not far if you"re on a horse, but walking... Should we rest for a bit? I"ll let you know. You"re home. We"re home. Can you get her inside? Think I"ll manage. Hey, boy. What you doing? Ah. Man of the house makes his triumphant return from the dead. Nora, come here, love. No. No. No. She"s happy here with me. What you want? I want... I want what every man wants. A nice home, and... a loving family. Well, you ain"t gonna find it here. Oh, I think I"m gonna like it here. My last family, it didn"t work out too good. Disobedient. These ladies shouldn"t be too hard to train. Nora, you all right? She"s fine. Women in this house can speak for themselves. But... it ain"t your house no more. Well, it sure as hell ain"t yours! Let her go. Please. And what if I don"t? Huh? Oh, are you... You gonna draw on me, huh? I ain"t no gunslinger. No, no. You"re just a rancher. I could use someone to keep this place up. You can sleep in the stable. Take the house. Let them leave. And why would I do that? Take your fucking hands off my wife! I don"t think you understand the predicament that you"re in, rancher. You see, I"m going to do more than just put my hands on her. She ain"t yours no more. What happened to your pretty notions, rancher? I thought you weren"t pointing guns no more. Forgot to say, that one"s jammed. I "m afraid I ain"t got much use for a crippled ranch hand. No! She ain"t gonna be your whore. None of us is. Well, you ain"t, that"s for damn sure. No! Goddamn it! This is my house! And you bitches will do as I say. Get your fucking hands off of her. You"re about to breathe your last. And ain"t nobody ever loved you. You feel that? Sweet Jesus. Erik? Erik, can you hear me? Erik? Erik? Oh, thank God. Oh, Abigale, he"s alive. There there, Cassie.
