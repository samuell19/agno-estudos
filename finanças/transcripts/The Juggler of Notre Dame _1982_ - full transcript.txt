("The Blue Danube Waltz") (birds chirping) (whimsical music) (birds chirping) (whimsical music) (Sparrow clears throat) - Who are you? - Sparrow, let me open that for you. - All right, you shouldn't drink on an empty stomach. - I ate. - Oh. - You first. (Barnaby scoffs) To a very great juggler, huh. - You've been following me for two weeks, why? - 'Cause your magical. - I'm a juggler. - Better than anyone I've ever seen. - It's what I do, it's all I ever could do. - Who, who'd wanna do anything else (chuckles)? It's in the air (exhales deeply). You catch it (chuckles). (dramatic music) (birds chirping) I wanna be your assistant. - I can't afford an assistant. - I'm not very expensive. I have nothing. You know, and I don't do anything. I never really could do anything. You do something wonderful (chuckles). Can you teach me what you do? - I don't teach. - Maybe I could pick it up, please. - I'm tired (groans). - Okay, okay, uh. (birds chirping) (whimsical music) - I wanna take a nap. - I got an idea. Take my coat so you don't catch cold. - Please, don't be so kind. (whimsical orchestral music) - If you need me, I'll be right up here, okay? - Suit yourself. (dramatic music) (moves into whimsical music) (bottle clinking) - Hey fella. Wake up now, rise and shine. You see, we don't allow drunks to use this park as a bedroom. (bottle clinking) Wake up. - [Sparrow] Shh. - Rise and shine. All right, here we go. Come on, come on now. - Uh, it's just a little wine. - A little wine? The man can't stand, come on. Get up, here we go. - I, I think he's hungry. - Thanks. - I, I know he's hungry. - Thanks. Up you go, all right, here we go, come on. - You wouldn't wanna run a man in just because he's hungry? - I'll see he gets a square meal. - Come here, I see that he works. - You will, and what do you do? - He's a juggler. - Please, give us a break. We're leaving town anyway, promise. (whimsical music) - All right, beat it, beat it, go on. - Thank you officer, thank you, thank you. (whimsical orchestral music) - God's little apples. - Go on, getting religious on me now? - Why, don't you believe in God? - I believe, but he wants a painful world. One I don't understand. - Never miss, it's a gift, you know. - I hate to pass the hat, I hate it. (whimsical orchestral music) - Hey wait, I don't mind passing the hat. I don't mind, really. You're a wonder! - [Barnaby] I am not, I am less than I appear. - A man with your talent. Barnaby, why do you juggle on the street corners? (Barnaby spits) (whimsical orchestral music) - [Barnaby] That's good. (whimsical orchestral music) - Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, faster, faster, come on! - [Sparrow] Am I a juggler? - [Barnaby] No, but you're gonna start. You've got fast hands, good concentration, and let's do it all over again. ("William Tell Overture") (water splashes) ("The Blue Danube Waltz") (crowd laughing) ("The Blue Danube Waltz") (crowd applauding) ("The Blue Danube Waltz") (crowd applauding) (horn blowing) (whimsical orchestral music) (bird chirping) - Hi guys, how are ya? Nice day, huh? Hi Barnaby! Got the groceries. - Three weeks, I bet ya I gained five pounds. (Sparrow imitating bird) Oh, come on. Tell me, what's up? (chuckles) Come on. - I got us a job. - (chuckles) That's good, where do we juggle? - A hospital. (dramatic music) It's a children's ward. - [Barnaby] No. - Why not? - If you wanna do it, you do it. - Oh, I couldn't uh. - I avoid hospitals. They make me sick. - Okay. Hey Barnaby, who's Beatrice? - Beatrice, Sparrow, she was beautiful, small, dainty. She worked with her family. They worked the high-wire for a hundred years, 200 years, in Europe long before they came here. God, I used to watch her. I was so in love with her. We got married in the center ring. We shared dreams. We were so in love. We were going to have five children. She fell before the largest crowd carnival had in years. (mysterious music) In my mind I see her fall over and over and over and over again, and I run, run, trying to catch her with my hands, these hands! As if, as if the juggler. What time is that show? - What show? Oh, with the kids? Tomorrow morning. Why don't you think it over? Are you thinking it over? - I'll think it over. (whimsical orchestral music) They fly like birds, don't they, hey? (whimsical orchestral music) Catch this. (whimsical orchestral music) Hey, oh, catch it, very good, hey! - Well, we can't thank you gentlemen enough. - [Barnaby] Oh, sister is grand, look at that! - Oh, oh. - Oh, no thank you, ma'am. We, we weren't really expecting any. - Oh please. - Oh, oh, thank you, ma'am (chuckles). Now look, look, I got enough money for a new pair of pants. - Oh, oh, here. - (chuckles) That's real uh, look. Yeah, socks would be good maybe. - Oh, yeah. - (chuckles) Look, look, rips. - Oh, there you are. - Ooh, trip to Europe, Riviera, just joking, joking. - Sparrow, come here, come here. - Be right back. Keep that open. ("William Tell Overture") - [Barnaby] You cold? - Oh no, just my hands, but you know, they're so far away from my body I hardly notice them. - Mm hmm, well good, drink your coffee, it will warm you. - Thank you. Barnaby, don't you ever get tired? - Well, you wanted to be a juggler. - Barnaby, am I a juggler? - You're a juggler. - Hot dog, aha, woo hoo! I got an idea. Why don't we spring for a room tonight, huh? - A who? - Yeah, remember what they are? It's where they have soft beds, and springs with mattresses and everything. You could rest your old tired genius bones. - Maybe tomorrow. - My treat. - Goodnight little bird. - (scoffs) A bed, springs, sheets, pillows. (dramatic music) - [Barnaby] What the heck is going on? - [Sparrow] Barnaby! (Barnaby screams) - [Thief] I got it, let's move, let's go! (dramatic music) (Barnaby screams) (dramatic music) (rock thuds) (dramatic music) (horn blowing) (train rustling) (Barnaby screams) - I was sorry to hear about your friend. I saw you two in the Marketplace, it was quite an act. You two were so smooth. If you don't mind traveling with an old party. I can pass the hat for ya. Yeah, pass the hat. Oh, well make out. That's if you want a partner. Well, of course I don't do any juggling, but pass the hat. - No (chuckles). I'm through juggling, thanks anyway. ("The Blue Danube Waltz") (whimsical orchestral music) - Well, how do stranger? Welcome to Knightsbridge. Well, going anywhere in particular? - No place. - Then you're, you're not in a rush? - [Barnaby] No rush. - Man's been good to me as usual. - [Barnaby] Is He? - Yes, he is. I'm in need of a subject. - (chuckles) A subject? - Oh, your face, man. I wanna do your face. - You wanna do it (chuckles). - In stone. - Oh, you're a sculpturer? - Yes, yes, what do ya say? I'll be glad to pay you for your time. - Why not? - Good, good, Jonas Whitaker. - Barnaby Stone. - Stone, an apt name. You don't miss a trick, do ya? (bell ringing) - Jonas, your lunch! - Oh, my sister. Uh, sorry Dulcy. - Please! - Come, come, we'll get some lunch, and then we'll go right to work. Dulcy, set another place, we have company! Dulcy, see what the good Lord has brought us today. Sit, sit Barnaby. Who knows, we may even make you famous. - Hmm, don't think I'm meant to be famous. - Ah, don't you? I think he may have something in mind for you Barnaby. - Are you a professional model, Mr., uh? - No. - Well, what do you do? - Dulcy. - Just curious, Jonas. - [Jonas] Ah, if it isn't the good Father himself. - [Father] Hi Jonas. - [Dulcy] Sent from God, this one is. - Highly recommended, is he? - The man's a tramp. - Barnaby, meet the piano playing priest of Notre Dame. - How do you do, Mr. Stone? - Hello Father. - Well, you're in good hands Barnaby. - I'm gonna make that face eternal, Father. - Not this afternoon, come on. - What? - I got a surprise for you. - A day for surprises, what is it now? - [Father] Just come on. - It's the statue! Barnaby, it's the statue, come on! You sly dog, you promised to tell me. Come on, Barnaby! - Jonas, your lunch! - [Jonas] You were careful, weren't you? - [Father] Oh, we put it up when she was still in the crate. - [Hank] Father Delaney, look, I've got them! - [Father] Oh Hank, they're lovely. - [Hank] Oh, the perfume. - [Father] Come on, let me give you a hand with those. - [Hank] Oh, they're so beautiful. Gosh, I worked so hard trying to get them. - [Father] Look at these, Jonas, Barnaby. - [Jonas] Oh, beautiful. - [Father] Beautiful. - [Hank] They are so beautiful. Look at the beautiful Lady. Oh, my goodness. There she is. Oh, my Lady. - [Jonas] It's the finest thing I've ever done. - The face, who is the model? - A young girl, I saw her on the street one day. I loved her face, so I rushed home and sketched it. I lost it somehow. One day it just turned up. I believe in providence. Don't you like it? - It's, it's fine work. - Finished her weeks ago. I, I haven't been able to work since. I needed a subject. I, I looked everywhere. Couldn't find nothing, then you came along. - Jonas, listen-- - No, no, Barnaby, you listen. God gave me these hands. I gave something back. He's saying thanks. - Amazing. - [Jonas] Barnaby, here, I want you to try this on, come on. - [Barnaby] It's, that's your coat. - Put your arms in there, come on. (chuckles) Perfect, it's yours. - For me? - [Barnaby] Yes. - To keep it? - Yes, it's yours, Barnaby. - Thank you, Jonas. - Good morning. - Morning. - How long are you planning on staying? - Don't know, ask Jonas. - My brother is a very faithful person. Sometimes I think he believes too much. That's why I came here to take care of him, you know. Jonas has been hurt a lot. - Who hasn't? - Who hasn't? - Barnaby, come on, let's get to work. - Ah, Jonas, I noticed you gave away your favorite jacket. - It looked nice on Barnaby. - Oh, terrific. I guess I shouldn't say anything, but ah, when I bought that jacket, it was the last money I had. - She really is a generous person, Barnaby. She makes a mean apple pie too. Is that not the best apple pie you've ever had? - Very tasty. - Thank you. - Please, please excuse me. - I do not see why you are wasting your time. - Dulcy, we've talked about this before. It is my time and I will not account to you for my own time. - All right, all right. - Besides, I don't think it's a waste of time anyway. - [Dulcy] Well, you never think anything you do is a waste of time. - We've had the man under our roof for 10 days. I know every line in his face, but I don't know what's inside the man. - There's nothing inside the man! - Dulcy, come on. - [Dulcy] He's shiftless, worthless, purpose. He eats because I put food in front of him. - Dulcy. - He doesn't care if he lives or dies, and he does not care about you. I bet he never had any more money in his pocket than what you keep handing him. - Would you have me throw back a gift from God? - A gift from God, my foot! A man of your talent going from the statue of the Mother of God to a statue of him. - Dulcy. - You never even done a statue of me. - [Barnaby] Oh, hi Hank. - [Hank] Hi, Barnaby. - [Barnaby] Oh, those are beautiful. - [Hank] You should see my candlesticks. - [Barnaby] Candlesticks? What candlesticks? - Well, my gift for Mary. I wanna place them on each side of the pedestal. That is if I get them ready in time. - In time for what? - Christmas Eve, Midnight Mass. You didn't know? - I didn't know. - Well, we all are doing it. Making something of our specialty. That is if you got a specialty. Now, Christmas Eve, we will place them at the foot of Our Lady. Wives, husbands, children. Everybody is contributing. I am planning special roses for the occasion. (melancholy music) - Hello Barnaby. - [Barnaby] Hello Father. - Look at this. Look what these people have done to this marvelous, old relic of a church. This place was practically destroyed by an earthquake. Look what these people have done to it. Marvelously talented people. Made stained glass windows, painting, fixed the organ. Boy, they're determined to make Notre Dame worthy of its namesake in France by Christmas, a present. How's the head coming? - [Barnaby] Jonas seems pleased. - Extraordinary fellow, Jonas. Artist, gentleman. It's wonderful to find a new talent like that so late in life. - [Barnaby] Well, what do you mean? - Well, he used to be a storekeeper. - [Barnaby] A storekeeper, Jonas? - Yeah, didn't you know that? - [Barnaby] mm, mm. - Oh, he had a store. Sold everything from toothbrushes to farm equipment. He and his family used to live above it. Meant everything to him. It was quite unique. - [Barnaby] What happened to it. - Well, it burned to the ground. He lost his wife, his little girl, poor man. Had a heart attack. He didn't work for almost a year, I understand, and then one day he just started sculpting. He said he couldn't just sit any longer. Ah, what do ya say? Thank you, thank you everyone. Thank God for you all. - Looking more like a church all the time. - Coffee, coffee for everybody. - Oh, Mr. Stone, have you decided on what your gift is going to be? - [Jonas] Dulcy. - What did I say? Everybody's giving a gift. Why shouldn't he? - Please, Dulcinea. - Barnaby, have some wine. It's not necessary to think about a gift. - Well, it's awfully late, and I hope you excuse me, and thank you for your concern (chuckles). (melancholy music) - I think that's the saddest man I've ever known. He wanders the face of the earth believing he's never made a mark. - I'd give a lot to know what he's searching for. (dramatic music) (Barnaby clears throat) - Ah, Barnaby, I'm just working on you. Come, come see. - Ah, no thank you Jonas. I've just come to say goodbye. - Goodbye? - Mm hmm, I, I'm leaving. - Leaving, you can't leave, you're not finished yet. Besides, it's Christmas Eve. Where would you go on Christmas Eve? - Well, I'm used to the road. The time doesn't bother, you know. - Barnaby, at least come to the Christmas Mass. Dulcy's cooking pies. You can't leave without some of Dulcy's pie. - Goodbye Jonas, you've been a good friend. - Barnaby! You're leaving because you had nothing to give, aren't you? - Merry Christmas Jonas. ♫ And death's dark shadows put to flight ♫ Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel ♫ Shall come to thee, O Israel (choral music) ♫ What child is this, who laid to rest ♫ On Mary's lap is sleeping ♫ Whom angels greet with anthems sweet ♫ While shepherds watch are keeping ♫ This, this is Christ the King ♫ Whom shepherds guard and angels sing ♫ Haste, haste to bring Him laud ♫ The Babe, the Son of Mary ♫ Why lies He in such mean estate ♫ Where ox and ass are feeding ♫ Good Christians, fear, for sinners here ♫ The silent Word is pleading ♫ Nails, spear shall pierce Him through ♫ The cross He bore for me, for you ♫ Hail, hail the Word made flesh ♫ The Babe, the Son of Mary ♫ Raise, raise the song on high ♫ The Virgin sings Her lullaby ♫ Joy, joy, for Christ is born ♫ The Babe, the Son of Mary (owl hooting) (bird chirping) - Sparrow?

Barnaby, it's Christmas Eve and everybody's celebrating. Look, see, there she is alone, so, why don't you give her a show? - I haven't juggled, not since. - Barnaby, what could you have done? See sometimes, sometimes there's simply nothing one can do, but go on. - Go on and do what? - Live. - For what? - For me, uh, for Beatrice. For other people, for yourself. - Myself, who's that? - Ah, Barnaby the Juggler! - Sparrow, I have been so alone. - No, no, you aren't alone. We haven't stopped loving ya. Neither has He. - I swore I would never juggle again. What use has my juggling even been? - Well, just anyone in the world who's ever seen you and smiled. - It's not a very lovely world. - Oh, there's still love in the world Barnaby. Just look at this church. Look what they've done with it. Look at those gifts. (whimsical music) Barnaby, juggle for her. Oh no, you do it. It's too late for me. Go on. - Holy Mother of God. - Let it go. - It's just me, it's Barnaby. It's Christmas Eve, I know, and here I am. I brought nothing, I have nothing, except these things. Balls, pins, hoops, but they're all I have (chuckles). (whimsical orchestral music) Still got it. (whimsical orchestral music) - Hey Joey, come here, look at this. - Hey, he's juggling. What's he juggling for? - I don't know, let's go. (whimsical orchestral music) - I have one more I was very proud of to do. Maybe you'll like it, this one. (whimsical orchestral music) - Get the others, get everyone. (whimsical orchestral music) (bird chirping) (whimsical orchestral music) (moves into dramatic orchestral music)
