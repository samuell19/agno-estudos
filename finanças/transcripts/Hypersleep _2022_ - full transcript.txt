Look at me. Try to stay concentrated, Mr Corvi. Cervi... My name is Arturo Cervi. See how your memory is coming back? Good citizens always wear dark shoes. If I told you this statement is false, what could we say about good citizens? Where is my husband? May I speak to my husband? Calm down, I'm here to help you. I want to hear him again, please, let him talk. You've already listened to him twice, unfortunately, we have to proceed. - When did it happen? - Three months ago, July 15th. What year are we in? Calm down, everything's fine, I'm Dr. Levi, do you remember? You're awakening from a long sleep, do you know where you are? HYPERSLEEP You're too old for jogging, David! The situation was unbearable, 90,000 prisoners locked up in 180 prisons, which were constantly understaffed, the 'Hypnos' program prevented a total collapse of the system, after an initial diffidence, people understood, only a handful of people continue to protest, the usual troublemakers, but this reform was necessary, I don't want to be overly optimistic, but my aim is to completely eradicate crime. What a shit situation! Today is the anniversary, at least for me. I don't know when you'll receive this message. A whole year without mum. Because you killed her. You see? I can finally say it out loud. Let me speak to her, I beg you! Let me speak to her! - Calm down! - I had written something to say, but... - I beg you! - Calm down, breathe slowly. Your daughter still hasn't forgiven you, but the fact that she decided to leave you a message is a good sign. I didn't do anything! You have to believe me! Mr Jamal, I'm here to evaluate your clinical condition, not your case. We need to review what happened together, If you can't remember something I'll help you, it'll be quick, you'll see. How much longer? Twelve years, - for the murder of your wife. - I know the accusation, thank you. I'm obliged to remind you, it's the procedure. Procedure? This is fucking torture! A crime of passion, murder? What? You know, I only need to look at them to figure out what they've done. And you know I can't tell you anything about the inmates. Murder, in the heat of passion. A normal person who suddenly loses his mind and kills his wife. Are you planning to steal my job? Good Lord, no! I only look after their bodies, and that's perfectly fine with me. I'll gladly leave you all these poor devils' souls. What souls, Valli? - It's not like I'm a priest. - Well, maybe you are in a way, they confess their sins to you and you send them to do penance. I wish it was that simple. This one said he was innocent, and he even seemed sincere, it's not easy to put them back to sleep when they look you in the eye. Like I said, you're getting too old, too sentimental for this line of work. Viola? Do you like it? Beethoven is always Beethoven. Bach? Come on, I wrote it! - Genius! - Idiot! David? What are you doing? Is that her? Hey, forgive me, really, I didn't want that. I love you. How could you not? - Listen, you know that.. - I know that I shouldn't be here. Yes? Okay, I'll be right there. There he is. - Dr. Damiani? - Yes? - Andrea Rinaldi. - Pleased to meet you. Sorry I had to send for you. - No problem. - I hope I didn't interrupt anything. Actually, we've already met, but I'm sure you won't remember. Techniques and Models of Psychotherapy, I took it with you. A lifetime ago! He was the rising star of the faculty, when they told me you'd be here I figured it had to be somebody else. I doubt that you're here to drag up the past, in fact, judging by your luggage, I'd say you'll soon be joining us. Dr. Rinaldi will be taking over your position, David. I know it's still a month away, but this is my first prison assignment, so I came a bit earlier to observe you in action. A good idea, you'll be learning from the best. I'm sorry you found out like that, I was going to tell you today, but Rinaldi surprised us all. To be honest, I wasn't expecting it, I gave my soul to this place. That's why I feel it's my duty to protect you. You've worked here more than anybody, nobody should face so much pain for so long, the consequences could be unpredictable. You're not renewing my contract out of fear that I'll crack up? Five years ago, I initially tried to convince you that you were over-qualified, then I realised your decision was based on personal considerations, and I let it rest. I know how hard it was after your wife's death. What's that got to do with it now? David, you know it's connected. It's taken you a while, but the time has come to make a fresh start. What should I do? Open my own private practice? I wasn't even able to prevent my own wife from killing herself. Your wife was suffering from depression, you did everything possible. Do "everything possible", is that what our job has been reduced to? We give people the means to understand themselves, and lead better lives, but we can't decide for them. Are those images always the same at every awakening, don't you ever change them? They have to be the same, they choose them before entering hypersleep, they are their central theme over the years, reminders of who they are, they reassure them, even though you'll often see them panicking, and in that case, the system automatically lowers their brainwave frequencies. Mrs Greco, can you open your eyes? Drive me to the newsroom today? Anna, can you hear me? You don't need to go to the newsroom today, look around you, this isn't your home, right? - I'm in prison... - Exactly, Anna Greco, you were sentenced to 9 years of custodial sleep, you are entitled to quarterly reawakenings, unless the medical staff indicate otherwise, do you remember why you are here? I was... gathering information, an investigative report. That was your job, but that has nothing to do with you being here. That evening you were having dinner with friends, do you remember? A dinner on the beach, but then it started to rain, and when the time came to go back home, you got behind the wheel of your car. The asphalt was wet, and you had had a few drinks. There were... two girls who... who jumped into the middle of the street. They were two boys, and they were on the sidewalk, when you lost control of your car. I didn't mean to! Four weeks, and then what? And then I don't know, I need to get organised. Maybe I could go home for a while. Three hundred kilometres from here? Or maybe I could, sell my house, and look for one here, big enough to... have a real piano, let's say. Forget that, music's not your thing. While you're looking, why don't you come and stay with me? - Are you sure it's not a problem? - Sure? Not at all... I think that the real problems are about to begin. Mummy, mummy there are fish! Honey, are you lost? Wait, let's go look for your mummy, come with me! We want the truth! We want the truth! We want answers! Minister Costa, answers! LET'S WAKE UP FROM THE NIGHTMARE. - Do you work in there? - Eh? Do you get your kicks torturing prisoners? Actually, I do all I can to help them, believe it or not. Then why not tell us exactly what goes on in these places? What do you think happens? The prisoners sleep, and that's it. That's the bullshit Minister Costa tells us every day! We want the truth! Truth! Truth! Truth! You store people underground like corpses, you don't let us see them for years, is that worthy of a civilised country? I'm not the one who makes the rules, I'm sorry. I that what you tell yourself to clear your conscience? What is it? What's going on? Why isn't he shaved? It's an emergency reawakening, it wasn't programmed. He doesn't seem in that bad shape. No, his data is the problem. What do you mean? What did you do? I didn't do anything, his file opened like this, no name, no crime, no evaluation, nothing. You really don't remember me? I realise I'm only one of many, but you and I have many things in common. If you're so clear-headed, why don't you help me out? What's your name? The executioner who asks the condemned to hold his axe. A bit much, don't you think? You don't want to collaborate? Then I'll put you back to sleep right away. What about the test? There's no need for the test, the inmate is obviously in good condition. - But David... - Listen, do you want me to file a report to Dr. Levi and let her handle it? You'll put me back to sleep again without even knowing who I am? Think it over, David, don't make any rash decisions, you want to screw it all up now that you're about to leave? I didn't tell him anything, I swear. There was no need to, some things are written all over people's faces, a brilliant psychologist like you should know that. - Where are you going? - Yes, where are you going David? Now that we were just beginning to get along. Stay with him, I'll go see if I can find some I.D. among his personal belongings. What are you doing here? - You left him on his own? - Her values are all over the place! Fuck! Oh fuck! The oxygen. Do you think she's all right? Why don't you tell me? What's next in the plan? - What plan? - Stop fucking with me! Is everything that happened today a coincidence? - What's going on here? - We have to have him arrested. What? The malfunctioning is part of his plan. - What plan? - An escape plan! He and 517 are accomplices, in the reawakening room, there's an inmate that he woke up on his own, without informing me, he canceled all his data, so we couldn't put him back to sleep, then he sabotaged this capsule to create a diversion, 517 is probably already escaping. Why don't we talk about you instead, David? He wanted to put the inmate back to sleep without even knowing who he was, but there's more, will you tell him about your lady friend hidden in your room or should I? What's that got to do with anything? You've lost your mind. - Valli, what are you doing? - Now we'll all go and check on the inmate, then we'll figure out how to sort out this mess. We've known each other for years and you trust this asshole? I don't want to get into any trouble. Move! Viola... Did you do this? - What are you doing here? - Don't move! Why did you hurt him? I didn't do anything to him! Tell her, tell her! I didn't do anything! What the fuck's gotten into you, David? Go call Dr. Levi. Are you alright? Don't move, David, don't even think about it. Handcuff yourself. David! - Viola! - Over there. - Okay, now let her go! - Handcuff yourself! - Let her go! Please! - Three... two... - There! I've done it! - Well done! Now leave! Run away, while you still have a chance! Not so fast. A man has his needs, especially after years of abstinence. Let her go! Don't touch her, you bastard! Let go of her! Viola... Why? No! Let her go! Don't touch her, you bastard! I'll kill you! David! - David? - Viola? I'm not Viola, Mr Damiani, take a closer look at me. Mr Damiani? David? Are you with me? You're awakening from a long sleep, and I'm here to help you. Do you understand where you are? In prison... Very good. And do you also know why? I killed 517. Carlo, Conforti. I stabbed his throat with a spike. No, David, that's not what happened, but don't worry, that's normal, you're awakening from hypersleep and in this phase, dreams and memories tend to blend into each other Let's take it step by step, all right? Can you talk to me about her? Do you remember how you met? - Mummy there are fish! - Yes, honey, very nice, but let's give it back to the man, it's not ours. - He can keep it, if he wants. - No, thank you. Perfect. May I call you Leo? Okay Leo, now you go and sit on that chair over there, and talk to me as if I was your dad, that way I'll record your message and show it to him. Go. Are you ready? Go! Would you like to stand close by him? - Perhaps it could help him. - To say what? You know what my husband did, don't you? I'm sorry. I'm only here because he asked me to come. Leo, this is what we'll do, now you'll leave a message for your dad, then come to me and I'll give you the ball with the fish, in secret, but don't tell your mum, otherwise she'll get angry with me, okay? Do we have a deal? That was the first time you saw her, did you know then what her husband had been condemned for? I went to find out that same evening, he was a neurologist, he had murdered a woman he was having an affair with, his assistant, I think. Why did you go to find out? Were you already interested in Viola Conforti? She no longer went by that name. She had already filed for a divorce. And a short while later, you went looking for her. Good evening. I wanted to pay my compliments, you were all truly sensational. Thank you. I'm Dr. Damiani, you brought your son to record a video message. - Of course, excuse me, I'm a bit tired. - I can imagine. - So you're into classical music? - Yes, yes, I'm not much of an expert, but, - but, I like it, yes. - Who do you like in particular? Well, just about everybody, the classics let's say. Well, you can't go wrong with the classics. It was kind of you to come, - good night. - How's Leonardo doing? He's doing fairly well, I don't know why, but he adores you. Listen, the theatre bar is still open, may I offer you a drink? I haven't been going out much lately. Anyway, I'm late for the babysitter, so, really, I can't. Of course. Goodbye. Look... If you like, I can offer you a drink, I live nearby. - Is red all right for you? - Yes, it's perfect. A beautiful home, my compliments. It's the museum of my previous life. I can understand you. My life also changed from one day to the next. Well, tell me about it. Are you being all mysterious? I'll keep the rest for our second date. I doubt there will be a second date. It's a complicated period. Mr Damiani? Do you remember how long your relationship lasted? Four years. Actually, from the day you met Viola until the day you killed her husband, only eleven months went by. Viola had met somebody. Who is this guy exactly? He didn't want to tell me, but he definitely knows my husband well. Ah, that's what you call him now! I shouldn't have told you, just forget it! - What exactly are you looking for? - My hairband. Can't you stop for a moment? Sit down and we can talk! Please! In the beginning, I... I couldn't believe that Carlo had done those things. He always swore to me that he was innocent. But then during the trial, he closed himself off totally, he stopped talking to me, and with all the evidence mounting up, I... I told myself I had to look at the facts, and the facts told me he was guilty. Exactly. Yes, but that man told me that all the evidence had been planted, and he knew Carlo and the case well, - I understood from how he talked to me... - You don't even know who he is. So you think I should pretend everything's fine? So what should I do then? - Wake him up and let him escape? - No! No, but... you have access to all the files, and you're the only one who can speak to him directly. Maybe something can still be done. You still love him. You always say you wish you could do more for the people you reawaken, and now that you can, you turn the other way because he's my husband? A few days later, you detached Conforti's oxygen supply, do you remember now? First of all, you deleted all his data, so that his capsule would appear to be empty, otherwise your tampering would have set off an alarm, then you went and cut off his oxygen, Conforti would have died in silence, without anybody knowing. His corpse would have been found months later, and at long last, Viola would have stopped thinking about him. Conforti wasn't the person Viola thought he was, he was dangerous, a violent man. But things didn't go as planned. Another person died as well. Anna Greco. I only wanted to cut off Conforti's oxygen, but the capsule was connected to another. I didn't mean to... I know it's very painful to live through all this again, but it's the procedure, I'm sorry. Put me back to sleep. I'm tired. This time, I'm afraid I can't satisfy your desires. This is your final reawakening, Mr Damiani. Your sentence still lasts another 10 years, but you can serve them on parole. You admitted your crimes and have managed to elaborate them in a balanced manner. Your level of social toxicity is low, and your profile fully entitles you to enrol in the reintegration program. You should consider yourself lucky, it's not something that happens to everyone. Naturally, we expect full collaboration from you, either you follow the program to the letter, or these benefits will be revoked. - How long was I asleep? - Ten years, you recently turned 55. Damiani? Yes. You take me for a hooker? I've been waiting 20 minutes for you on the street. Sorry, I got lost, I couldn't find the building. Sure, let's go, stairway A, apartment 18. Shortly, you'll be assigned a job, nothing complicated, don't worry. The reintegration program entails a meeting with a support group every two weeks. - I don't think I'll need it. - It's mandatory. You have to sign in every day, and you're not allowed to leave the city. Pretty, isn't it? Practically a five star hotel, Damiani! This is your home now, but I can come in whenever I see fit, I can perform inspections, searches, I can also summon you to the precinct, just because... because I miss you. Everything I just told you is written here, that way you can't blame it on your fried brain. And remember that you're not a free man yet, zombies like you, who steal houses and jobs from honest citizens, are a dime a dozen, so just give me an excuse to put you back to beddy-byes, I couldn't ask for anything better. Come here. 175 please. Here you are. The thing that makes me feel the most... vulnerable, is that it can happen at any moment, anywhere, when I'm at work, when I'm shopping, they are real waking nightmares. It happens to me too, when I walk down the street, It feels like everyone is staring at me, that they all know who I am and what I did. They are the side effects of hypersleep, it's normal, you're realigning with reality, but you have to give yourselves some time, for years, your brains did nothing but produce dreams, to make up for the lack of outside stimuli, and now it's like an over-trained muscle, that functions even when it doesn't need to. I can't sleep anymore, or even stay concentrated. My brain is just one big mess, but I don't want to take all those pills any more. I was slowly fading away, David. How long could you have resisted? It was better this way. You know it too. All right, that's enough for today. See you all in two weeks, same place, same time. Damiani, Fabbri, Fiorillo, come here. StudioLab 78, Via del Macello, 10. Tomorrow, 6 PM, all three of you, and remember, on time and well-dressed, - it's part of the program. - And it's mandatory. - David Damiani? - That's me. It says you've just been just released, congratulations, you seem in in great shape, so David, the recording lasts just a few minutes, so remember, short and direct. Let's try this one. Just a few words about your hypersleep experience, and then straight to your present-day life, which is the focus, so, your new house, your new job, the support groups, let's try it on. There, much better! If you don't know what to say, don't worry, here are some sentences that can help you, short phrases that are easy to remember, and that work, trust me! Let's do a rehearsal. Not everybody gets a second chance, but I did, - I have a new house, new job, a new life. - Okay, David, let's try, perhaps, to give it a little more... Excuse me, a second. And if instead I described how I can't eat solid foods any more? That's interesting, don't you think? Or about my constant hallucinations? Thank you, David, you can go. No, wait, I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll do it! Be positive, natural, a big smile. You can do it! We're ready to shoot! What can I get you? A beer. David! You're already out after what you did? - I shouldn't have entered. - No, you shouldn't. Do you have any idea what I've been through these past ten years? With the press calling me a whore? The whore who was banging her husband's murderer! I... I don't know how I could have done such a thing. Don't ever show your face again! Do you hear me? "But you land elsewhere, in that recess" "of the heart that deals not with words," "that cares not about time, and doesn't lose itself in the flow" "of dreams." You're into love poetry? Good, I personally prefer a good fuck, but it's a matter of taste, right? People say that you zombies can't get it up anymore, is that true? Damiani, I asked you a question. Is it true or not? Does it make you feel stronger, to treat people like me like that? I won't kill you because I'd only be doing you a favour. What the fuck is this? Where's my list? Clean up this mess, fucking zombie! These aren't suitable jobs for you, Dr. Damiani. Valli? It's good to see you, - I dreamt you were dead. - Ah, thanks. Look at where they sent you. That symbol out there, you know they use it to mark the places where ex-inmates are, don't you? Why? Because it's full of whack jobs out there, desperate people, who say you steal houses and jobs from those in need. Never lower your guard, it's a shit world. Somebody left a photo in my house. A photo? Yes, a photo of a fountain. That's not good. - What are you doing? - Relax, I have a permit, it's all above board, I might be retired, but they left me my gun. Put it away! You put it away, they would never give one to someone like you, - do you know how to use it? - No, of course not! Well, make the effort to learn then, you have to defend yourself! Mr Greco? Do we know each other? No, no, I... I am... I was a colleague of your wife. It's a lot more than things not adding up, the truth is that Anna was innocent, they framed her to shut her up, because she was opening a Pandora's Box that had to remain shut. I feared for her life, you know? But they... were even more devious, they slandered her name, they portrayed her as an alcoholic, reckless, a killer! And they managed to discredit a whole lifetime's work. Who are they? Who's pulling the strings? Who decides how we should dress, what we should eat? The lodges! The oligarchies of high finance. They get into our heads, and the one behind it all is that snake Costa! Costa, the minister? The Prime Minister! Anna's investigations always riled him. Mr Greco, thank you for your time, I have to go now, goodbye. You know what the irony of fate is? She was working on the prison system, when they put her into hypersleep. She was investigating Hypnos? The police took away everything, computers, cell phones, hard disks, but they didn't find these things here. These are all articles about Anna, her arrest, the charges, the trial, I kept them all. May I? Conforti. You! I thought I had seen you some place before, now I recognise you! - You killed her, you filthy bastard! - Mr Greco... You! Go, get out of my house right now! - David, you shouldn't be here! - Viola! I'm calling the police! No, wait, give me five minutes, just five minutes! What do you want? Do you remember Anna Greco? In theory she died because her capsule was connected to your husband's, right? An accidental victim, but the truth is, they knew each other! Anna Greco was a journalist and she was investigating hypersleep. Here, she wrote that... where is it? Look, here, here! She wrote that she needed to analyse certain clinical cases with your husband, they were collaborating. It can't be a coincidence. I checked all the names on the list, they all served hypersleep sentences, they are all ex-inmates. Yes, Carlo had several of them in his care, they were suffering from depression, hallucinations. Anna Greco and your husband had dug up something about Hypersleep. I found something. It's an old report by Anna Greco, Italy's first "Hypnos" penitentiary. Yes, it doesn't say much, but look at this photo, It's Costa. Yes, and this one close to him "Elia Treves", he's the man who came to see me ten years ago, to tell me that my husband was innocent, I'm certain. There he is! It's him! Where are you going? Trust me! Mr Treves? It took me a while, but I found you again. That wasn't a good idea, believe me, go back home, forget about me. - Don't move! - David, what are you doing? Don't move! After Conforti was sentenced, you contacted Viola, isn't that so? You said you knew my husband well, do you remember? And that I shouldn't believe that he was guilty. Why would someone from the Ministry expose himself like that? I'm talking to you! I always thought that Hypnos was corrupt as hell, and since I was aware of her husband's studies on hypersleep, I slipped him some reserved files from the Ministry. I couldn't have imagined it would end like this. So Conforti was innocent? Anna Greco was too. And am I too? Am I innocent too? You don't remember, do you? Damiani. They really fry your brains in there! Even those like you who are paid to fry the brains of others. Get out! You too, out! David! No bullets? You see? You're not a killer! Never come looking for me again! Let me see. Thanks. I'm not much of an action hero. I'm sorry, David. It's all my fault. No. Yes, I asked you to help me. It wasn't your fault. In fact, you made me open my eyes. You reawakened me. I have to go, I have the night shift. Take my car, I don't need it. Thanks. Bye. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow, yes. This is an unauthorised reawakening, I am interrogating inmate 517, Carlo Conforti, accused of murdering his assistant, Miriam Zorri. I didn't mean to kill her, she wanted to tell my wife, so I... Mr Conforti, please, concentrate on... what you were telling me before, do you remember? We were talking about Hypnos, you were saying that during the reawakenings, the inmates' brain waves are slowed down. Of course, that's how you keep them calm, right? Too bad that this also means lowering all their defence mechanisms, opening wide the doors of their subconscious, and right in that moment, all you do is remind them of the dynamics of their crime. Are you saying that the inmates are fed false memories? Without a real life working as a counterweight, the reawakened project everything that is told to them into their dreams, infinite dreams, that last years, and over time their memories... It wasn't me, was it? I wasn't the one who killed my assistant. I'm afraid I was the one who made you believe it. How long have I been in hypersleep? Almost two years. Two years, and I was already confessing to everything. I'm sorry, but I have to put you back to sleep. Why are you doing this? Don't say anything if you want to avoid putting her in danger! Do you understand, don't tell her anything. Let me go! Fuck! - Thank you. - Welcome. - Welcome, good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, your name? Dirado. - Perfect, thank you. Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, your name, please? - Alessandro D'Elia. Here I have an Alessandra D'Elia... There must be a mistake, right? - Yes, I imagine so. - Thank you! You here too, doctor? David! - You were released! - Come with me! Don't even think about it! I have a gun, come with me! What elegance, Rinaldi, you've moved up in the world! Where is she? Who? Viola, where have you taken her? That Viola? I haven't seen her in at least ten years! Where the fuck did you take her? Do you want to put her to sleep too? David... Costa! You work for Costa? You were working for him from day one! You're delusional, David, you're not clear-headed yet, you just got out. It was you! You cut off the oxygen from Conforti and Greco! But you're the one who condemned them to death! You started to reopen old files, and interrogate in your own way, one way or another, they had to stop you! And you pitched in to help the cause. I count for little or nothing, David, there's an organisation behind this that you can't even imagine! You'd better disappear fast! The statesman who more than any other, has worked towards the ideals of progress, security, and justice in our country. Tonight, he will illustrate the new priorities of his political agenda, always at the forefront, and always dedicated to improving the lives of our citizens, regardless of useless ideologies. Too kind, too kind, thank you! For me, this is a special night... Very, very special, President! Don't move, nobody move! Don't move! - Keep calm, don't panic, keep calm! - Don't move! You, drop the gun, drop it! Drop the gun! Calm down, keep calm! Don't panic, just keep calm! Do you know who I am, President? - Should I? - Mr Damiani is an ex-inmate, President. What can I do for you? - I want Viola! - Viola? Viola Conforti, I know you brought her here! Don't move! Don't move! Keep calm, you're the one who asked me to find Mrs Conforti, right? Yes, but don't try anything! Calm down, you can trust me. Trust you? You made me believe I was a killer when in fact I'm innocent! Mr Damiani, I don't know the details of your case, if you were unjustly condemned, I'm sorry, but my focus is on security, not justice, my mission is to make sure that every single street in this country is safe, that every shopkeeper can roll up his shutters without fearing robberies. And those who disagree, go straight to prison? What you or I think doesn't matter Mr Damiani, all that matters is the data! Do you know how much criminal recidivism has diminished since Hypnos? Previously, 80% of those released from prison would return to crime, today that percentage has fallen to 4%! And do you know why? Because hypersleep destroys a person's identity! And you think that before the inmates had it better? Crammed into overcrowded penitentiaries, unlivable and in perennial states of violence? Do you think that before, in prison, they'd be re-educated? I gave you a house, a job, I gave you a second life! A second life? Hypnos is a system that works, it's clean, efficient, and economical, but if you want to suggest that it's a criminal system, then I proudly declare myself, its leader! Viola! Viola, are you all right? - Did they hurt you? - There, you see? We are still in time to resolve this matter like gentlemen, put away that gun, forget everything and go back home with your companion, we'll pretend that none of this ever happened. Okay, okay, but let her go. Viola, are you all right, are you okay? Go in peace, Mr Damiani, and enjoy your new life. David. That's enough. Take me home. Let's go home, okay? Well done, you're making the right choice. Go home and never turn back for any reason. David. It's better this way, and you know it too. Mr Damiani? Can you hear me? Mr Damiani. Calm down, everything's okay, I'm Dr. Levi, remember? You're waking up from a long sleep. Do you know where you are? Why am I here? - You put me back to sleep? - Don't get worked up again, look at me and keep breathing. I wasn't here, you were the one who released me. You never set foot outside of here. You're confusing things with what you have just dreamed about, but that's perfectly normal, being released from prison is the most recurring dream among inmates. I'm... I'm innocent... I'm... I'm innocent. Mr Damiani, I've been working here for four years, and at every reawakening, you always repeat the same thing. No... You must realise that your sentence is final, the evidence against you is overwhelming. I have the evidence! I gathered it when I understood that they had framed Conforti. - You killed Conforti. - No! - Remember? - I didn't kill him! I woke him up and he told me how hypersleep works. It's this system that fries our brain, and makes us remember whatever they want us to! But I recorded everything, and I hid the video here in my... where is it, where is it? Where is it, where's my cap? Where's my cap, where is it? - Doctor, is everything all right? - Yes, everything's fine, thank you. You're welcome. You're getting confused, let go of these fantasies, and focus on me. Look at me. Listen to me, now I'm going to show you something, but prepare yourself, a lot of time has passed. A lot of time since what? You've had to serve a long sentence. How long? You have served 35 years of hypersleep. No... No! Today, you're 80 years old. It's difficult, I know. But in a year you will have served out your sentence, and you'll be a free man again. Try to focus on that right now. Now do you remember your crime? Murder. I had a wife, you know, a long time ago, but I wasn't able to... protect her. At least with Viola I had to succeed. I did what... was necessary. THE PSYCHOLOGIST DAVID DAMIANI HAS BEEN ARRESTED - 111 you said? - Yes, that's right. - Here you are, take your time. - Perfect, thanks a lot. Finally! It took you a lifetime! But now I'm here.
