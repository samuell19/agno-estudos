If you see the 3D sign on the screen? put on you 3D lenses? and enjoy. This is an advice of ?Amazing Monsters?. ?Hypertricosis?: hormonal hyper-secretion that produces a freaky hair growth... caused by a mutation in the Horripilous glands. This disease terribly affects young people. I don?t care about the ?Opus dei? or the ?Ku Kux Klan? But I do know that we must find a cure to that mutation. And give those fuzzy little fellows a better life. Dr. Dickinson research resulted in a new theory that... might give us the most effective therapy... but its not an easy task. Right Dr Dickinson? -Indeed my general. 350.000 miles away from earth, towards "Piaasy bootny" asteroid... there is a Gamma ray field of unique frequency. Which applied to the human brain and horripilous glands under medical supervision... produces a regression of the disease that could? lets say, cure this terrible affliction. This is a project of the united nations Galaxy 3000 consortium. The scientific team also includes: Dr Hans Sparkasse... a mathematician from Wella institute in Hamburg... and Dr Eva Petricova specialized in epidermic studies... at the ?Comian? university at the Aegean sea. How are we going to reach the Gamma ray field? Don?t you worry Young Lady, in ?Hangar 69? there is a rocket waiting for us? Am I right general? - Exactly, we must start immediately. After you mademoiselle. ? Thanks. Nice place! (Yes, more than nice?) (so tasty...) (Ho yes, just like that...) It would make us proud, to me and to our nations... that you find the cure to Hypertricosis. Thank you my general. we all hope to fulfill our mission as perfectly as possible. Once in an island at de Aegean sea... I studied an epidermic disease, that... produced certain impulses on the patients? Do you hear me? -Yes, I?m all ears. ( I?m all penis and I all pleasure too? mh so tasty! ). Cannibalistic and anthropofhagic impulses. Did you know Dr that ?? Ho... -Well? Oh I?m sorry my lady. ( Oh yes... yes ) You?ll see Dr Petricova... sometimes, I also have certain impulses ? All this time in a spaceship? with a sensual and provocative woman such as yourself... Oh? Dr Sparkasse. What the hell is going on here? I dropped the samples of Hypertricosum DNA, and Dr Dickinson was helping me. Dr dickinson according to my calculations... we are about to reach the gamma ray field. Maybe you shoud be preparing the reception instrumental. Instead of been flirting with Dr Petricova. I didn?t mean to offend you. -But you have. All my life doing things for other people, but? What is it good for? If I have no one by my side... ...to give me some satisfaction. I?ll have to satisfy myself? again. Luckily I managed to bring these naughty magazines with me. Attention ! You are about to enter the Gamma ray field. Get into the radiation shielded area. Otherwise you could suffer irreversible mutations. I?ll repeat: mutations will be irreversible. Where is Dr Dickinson? Damn it! All that noise it?s ruining my pleasure time! Oh my god! The Gamma rays? no!! I must find Dr dickinson. I must find Dr dickinson. -No ! You will stay here. But if we don?t save him he?ll die ! He didn?t follow the protocol, we?ll have to let him die. - But... Why? Because I love you Eva? And after he dies you will be mine ! And we?ll live happily ever after in space. Let me go, you are mad! Let me go! You are mad, let me go! Don?t touch me, get your filthy hands off me! Don?t leave, come back Dr. You are out of danger now. I?ll repeat: you are out of danger now. Where are you going Dr Petricova? I?ll find Dr Dickinson. Dr Dickinson. Dr Dickinson? Dr Dickinson? Are you there? Dr Dickinson ! Verfluchten weisswurst! (Damn White-sausage). Attention this is general Watson from earth. what is all that noise? what is going on? Answer!! What is going on over there?! Damn it, we?ve lost communication. General, the ship is changing its flight course. Oh my god, it is coming back to earth. Oh come on... just a little bit. Stop it Billy Joe, you know I?m a Jehovah?s witness? we?re not doing it until we are married. How much will I have to wait? What was that? I?ll take a look. -No. No Billy Joe please don?t go, I?m scared. Leave me alone, you are such a bother. Don?t go! Oh Jehovah! Why are you testing me like this? You know how much I would like to taste his? Mary Ann... Mary Ann! We've got to go! A meteor just crushed here, we must go to the police station. Mary Ann !! Ho no !! Write this down... A Young couple, approximately... 20 years old. Such a slaughter. General ! general ! Corporal Palomarez, liutenant Romero did you find the space ship? Yes my general. There are no survivors. And Dr Dickinson corpse is gone. - Dr Dickinson... It can?t be true. Well, well? I can see that you?ve already pitched the tent. We're going to have lots of fun tonight. Right boys? I?ve did it fine too. Haven?t I sergeant Wild-Bill? Yes, I?ll give you a very special reward later Sparky. What the fuck? Son of a whore! What was that? It?s coming from in there my general. Well?What are you waiting for? Go take a look. Corporal Palomarez you should be working at McDonald?s... you are the shame of the army! It?s a monster, lets shoot him! The boys just found something, take cover miss Agrasanchez. God Almighty? Dr Dickinson! What has happened to you? Miss Agrasanchez! Are you alright miss Agrasanchez? Yes but? that thing is heading to the city. Do you know how many beautiful women are in town? It?s going to be a massacre. - Corporal Palomarez where were you? That giantic worm almost kill us my general. General Watson is that a gigantic pennis? - Yes, and it?s Dr Dickinson. He mutated into whatever he had close at hand. What do you mean? Ehh?Anyway, that spray scared him away. What is it? It?s just a common spermicidal spray my general. I'll not ask you why do you keep that in your purse, but you just gave me an idea. We must keep him from away from the city. We?ll bring him back with something he'll not be able to resist. Palomarez, did you bring the movie I asked you? This one is the best my general. One of those that keep the boys warm during the night watch? yes that will do. Good!! you brought the chemical we used to sterilize those apes on the Korea war. I love the smell of that shit !! By the way, could you tell me what is it? It's a spermicide made of walrus pheromones and radioactive Polonium-210 my general. Perfect !! We?re ready my general. - Ok then? everybody in position and?
