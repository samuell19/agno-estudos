You making cake? Oh, that's right baby girl. Can I help? You wanna help? I can lick the bowl. Oh, that comes with a reward. You got to put the work in before you get the reward. What do you know about baking cakes? Well number one, you got to start with the freshest ingredients. The freshest! Do you know what ingredients are? Stuff that goes inside? That's right. You get out what you put in. Now that's a life rule. And number two, you got to let the cake cool before you frost it. And last, you got to have people around to eat it! Because cake makes people happy. So one bowl, one mixer, and the right company, and baby girl, you're set for life. Add some apples. That's my girl. Now you give it a stir. There you go! There you go. That's my girl. Oh, you make me so happy. You make me so happy. Dirt car. Angela Logan? Ms. Crawl. Well, I see the second story status hasn't changed. Basement still uninhabitable? As I explained, our contractor- And no permits have been pulled. Disappeared. I didn't know he was supped to pull permits. Well, it's your home. And by the looks of it construction continues. Trust me, there's nothing going on here. It's a safety hazard, your boys could get hurt. My boys are fifteen, seventeen, and nineteen, practically men. Look, we're doing the best we can. You have fourteen days before I start assessing fines. And they're large fines Ms. Logan. I suggest you get yourself in order. Give up. You're never going to make it. Yoohoo! Anybody home? In here! Hey. Hey. I didn't see your car out there. Completely dead. Why didn't you call me? On what? I gave up my cellphone. I'm so behind on my mortgage, the last thing I need is a cellphone. Do you have any idea how much three teenage boys eat? Here, have some. Cake makes people happy. Well then you should be eating it. Oh, I could live on that cake. So good! You know what you need around here? Some help. I cannot afford a house keeper. I meant a man. I've got three men already, I don't have room for another one. Those aren't men, those are boys. I mean a man who gives you stuff instead of taking stuff. Well, I've never had experience with a man like that. Check my caller ID, Bobby called. Not all men are like your ex, baby. How would you know that, you've never been on a date in what, four or five years? I've got William's and Nicolas' school fundraiser tonight. And then volunteering at the charity, and then helping out at church. I'm just saying it's- Someday it won't just be about survival. Someday I'll have a thing of my own to be proud of, saying something like that? Yeah. Hey Gloria. Hi babies. Hey mama. I'm starving. We got anything to eat? Oh my gosh, they keep getting taller. Yeah. Look at their feet. Hey, don't you look at my feet. Excuse me, I've been looking at your feet since they were the size of my thumb. We got no secrets here kid. Nicki's got one. Don't you Nicki? Uh oh, I'd better go. I love you. Love you. Hey, be good. He brought a knife to school. Nicki! William! God. I didn't do nothing with it. You didn't do nothing with it. Why would you do that? What were you thinking? Dad gave it to me. What? he said he had one when he was younger than me. Said I should have gotten one a long time ago. I'm good with it. And he told me the rules. Oh! Except don't take it to school. Yeah, and now he's suspended for a week. Nicolas! This is a very busy week for me. I can't have you at home! I know. You've always got something else to do. Nicolas. Nicolas, come back here! Hey, don't look at me. I did all I could do, I don't carry no weapons. Hey, is this apple cake I see? It's for the school fundraiser, leave it alone. Come on baby, we got to talk about this. If you get suspended, I get to talk. Nicolas, open the door! I'm going to the charity for a meeting, and when I get bad we're all going to the fundraiser. I don't think I can do this. These are practical skills, nothing you can't learn. I see you've already been through the resume writing class and basic computer skills. Except there's not much on my resume. This is about the future, not the past. Let's try some interviewing, okay? Tell me about yourself Leanne. What's one thing you can say about yourself that's never changed no matter how tough things got. I can work hard. Good! Good! Say that! Okay, now say it like I'm someone who might hire you for a job you want more than anything else in the world. I can do anything ma'am. I just need a chance. That's it Leanne. Start there. How do you know this stuff? Let's just say, I've had a lot of jobs. Nicolas! Nicolas, come on! Mom, where's the car? There you are. You're late. Late for what? The fundraiser. Nicolas! I don't even go to that school anymore. We show up as a family. What happened to the car? It broke. Am I going to school next semester? Mom, you can't fix the car, you can't fix the house. You haven't been called a substitute teacher in two weeks. Yes, you're going to school. But my work study job won't cover the costs. We will do without the car if we have to. We will sleep in that car if we have to. Yeah, mom is going to go around helping all these other people before she gets around to us. Nick! Okay. I help people at the charity because they deserve a better life. I bake cakes for your school so you, and your friends, and this community can have a shot at doing something with the one life they've got. Because you're lucky, Nicolas Logan. Yes! Maybe today isn't a red letter day. But someone's always got it worse than you. If all you've got is a carrot in your pot- In the soup. Yes, if all you have is an onion, someone else will have a potato, and someone else will bring a carrot, and in the end, you all eat. We stand up for each other. Because there's something bigger than you. So yes, you two will stay in school. Get scholarships! And you will learn to appreciate what you've got. Now come on, we're walking. So, this girl wants to study on Sunday. Bring her to church! Mom, nobody brings their girl to church on a date. You said study. Oh, here's a napkin. Isn't this incredible? I was up all night so stressed, you know? Not knowing how these things were going to turn out. Oh! Is that your apple cake? I knew we could always count on you. Oh, this whole display is just fantastic. Well, I heard you were suspended. I can leave at any time. Oh! No no no no no. No no no. It's fine! We could always use some more, um, card dealers! Go find some brand new games. No, I'm good. Okay, well. Suit yourself. Angela, I'm going to need you to push those raffle tickets. Our prizes this year are out of this world. Melvin! Oh, there you are! Okay, you're on in three. Okay. Good Thanks. Angela? Angela Logan? Melvin George? Angela Logan, you have not changed one bit. Still using those same lines, huh? It depends.. Does it still work? Hey, save me a piece. I'd like to catch up. Hm? He has graced the stages from New York to Chicago, and we are so thrilled to have him back home in Teaneck, New Jersey. Please put your hands together for Melvin George! Thank you, thank you. My name is Melvin George, and I know you can't tell by looking at me, but I am not cool. Normally, I wear a tuxedo when I perform, but when I went to pick my tux up from the cleaners, they were closed, and this was all I could get out before the alarms went off. It's true, I am not cool. I had to pay back my student loan. A conversation a few years ago went like this. Hello? Yeah, this is Melvin George. Department of Education? Well how'd you find me? Well, how come you can find me, you can't find Osama Bin Laden? Well, I'll tell you what. You find Osama Bin Laden, and I'll pay back my student loan. I remember that guy. You dated him years ago. Next day I was like, Department of Education? I made some payment blame. Thank you! Thank you very much! My name is Melvin George. Get out there, spend some money for Lincoln High and education of our young people. Can you hand me that fork? So, what'd you think? You haven't changed a bit. And these must be your boys. Yes. This is Marcus, and William, and Nicolas. Boys, this is Melvin. Pleasure to meet you all. If you don't mind, I'll help you clean up. I'll stay with the boys, get them home. No, I should stay with Nicki. No, it's okay. You deserve it. So, did you only like me for my cooking? I like plenty of things about you. It's been ten years. what could you possibly remember about me? Plenty. Start yapping. Come on, catch me up. Well, not much has changed. I'm still scraping by just like everybody else. Maybe once my boys leave home I can start spending more time on me. What would you do? Try to find a way to make a living doing something I love. Give back. That's exactly why I got into comedy. [laughing] Yeah. It's always bad timing for us. Yeah. Bad timing. Let me take you out on a date. Don't say no. As a matter of fact, say yes without even thinking. Melvin, we have been down this read before. Oh, let me get that for you. Thank you. Okay. Got you. You good? Yeah. Woo! Thank you for driving me home. It's my pleasure. Shoot. Oh. It's okay, I got it. I'm sorry, it's too soon. It's too soon. Angela. So much for timing. Hey mom. Morning. I saw the mail. We're losing our house? No. And don't tell your brothers. Hey mom. So I have this presentation later on this week for my computer class. Do you think you could help me rehearse? No. Not right now honey, it's not a good time. Oh. Okay. So, what didn't you want Marcus to tell us? Oh yeah. Let's not talk about the house. It's just, I thought Things just got bad faster than what I expected boys. Yeah, we've been through tough spots before. Not like this time. There's just not that many jobs out there. Well, can we sell it? Not in this condition. And not fast enough. But I have a plan. Want me to get you four thousand dollars in ten days? That's what the letter said, right? Four thousand dollars in ten days, or else? Nicolas! What? Okay. Come help me make lunches. Two of you have to get to school today. Nicki, you're with me. Angela, I'm so sorry. Your volunteer work has been invaluable. I will take any kind of hours, any work, I just need a quick paycheque. We don't have any jobs available right now. Check back in a month? I'm sorry. Is there anything else we can do? You don't ever fix up volunteer job opportunities? As you know, our priorities are women without homes. Of course. Thank you. Okay. Sit here. Hi Leanne. So, did you read the books I gave you? Yup. Did they help? Yeah, but I've also learned that older workers keep their jobs longer, so there's no turnover. That was for house keeping job. Fast food companies are interviewing people with college degrees. I've been homeless, beat up, and I've got a four year old son. Why would anybody hire me? You have to have faith. You never know what's going to turn up. Didn't I send you away? Uh no, you said good night. You mentioned something about bad timing and that we laughed a lot, but 'go away' was not apart of that. It's been a long day. Melvin- What if you said, 'You've driven all this way. Why don't you come inside, I'll make you some hot cocoa and we could talk about it?' I'm dead broke. I'm losing my house. My son got suspended for bringing a knife to school and I have no idea what I'm going to feed my kids for dinner. So whatever you've got- What if I got you dinner? Huh? I know a great new joint that just opened up down the street I'll get some take-out. Come on. Okay. That's more like it. I'll be right back. No, I'm telling you, I am not cool. I got my first computer. Still, I bought it in 1985 for four thousand dollars. I ain't upgrading. It's a compact 186. Got a speed of twelve. When I'm on the information superhighway, I got to go all the way to the right. When you get on the internet I'm the dude going, 'Go around! Go around!" I'm not cool. Too bad you can't sell it for four thousand dollars now. that's exactly what we need, right? You know what I like about computers? You only get out what you put in. They're kind of like people. You wanna slice the corn bread for us? So, two years ago, flood wasted the basement, and two months after that, a storm took the roof. So, in an effort to fix both, I hired a corrupt contractor who left me broke, and with a house like this, and with a city inspector on my back. Meanwhile, taxes went up, mortgage went up, utilities went up. jobs went away. Mom's good at jobs. Yeah, she has a new one every few months. Well, that just means you're interprizing. You're the victim of that- Oh, oh no. I don't play that. I hired the contractor, I took out the second mortgage, it's my fault. Yeah, but it's not your fault that the economy tangged, and banks went in the run and you can't get a leg up. If you keep getting job after job, you're doing everything you can. Shouldn't there be enough to go around? Time is working against me. Amount is getting higher, and right now all the talent I have is for baking that cake. Too bad I can't bake my way out of this. That's not a bad idea. I mean, yeah mom. Everybody loves your apple cake. Wait wait wait. Nobody in this house ever says my ideas are good. Well, this one is! Save the house with a bake-sale. It's four thousand dollars! thats- one hundred cakes in ten days. Forty dollars a cake? Who's gonna pay forty dollars for a cake? Yeah, but if we tell them we're in trouble- No. It is not charity. They're giving you money for something, not nothing. Yeah, I mean it's like stone soup. We got the carrots, they got the money. And we can stay in the house. Isn't that what we want? We can ask at church, school? I got a few thousand fans, some website we can reach out to. Absolutely not. no. No no no no no. Hey! If you gotta ask, you gotta ask everybody. Right? You are stubborn. That's how I managed to stay afloat all these years. What my grandmother said, the one that owned this house first, is you either stand, or you fall. It's a life lesson. Some people choose to lean. Melvin, I have 'till next thursday to save my house. I cannot do this too. Thanks for dinner. It was nice. It was nice. You got good kids. I think you're making a mistake. About the apple cake? That's ridiculous. No, about sending that guy away. Where are you going? Out. Bring the girl to church on Sunday. Mom. You heard me. Fine. Do you want anything before I go? Um Four thousand dollars. I'll work on it. Computer geek! Got an e-mail to write. Dear Friends, I never imagined I'd be writing this e-mail... But my home, which was my mother's and grandmother's, is facing foreclosure. In an effort to save it, I'm having a bake sale. My moist, delicious apple cake which was my grandmother's recipe, and now has lots of fresh apples, organic wholegrain flour, and buttercream frosting. I'm selling it for forty dollars a cake. Now, I know forty dollars is a lot for everyone right now, But if I can bake and sell ten cakes a day for the next ten days, I can pull my home out of foreclosure. I'm calling it, my Apple Mortgage cake. Great. I will put it right here so people can see it when they come in. Thank you so much Sheila. Are we done now? You know this would go a lot faster if you would stop whining. Next stop your school, and then the grocery store. Well, I can't go to the school because I'm suspended. Remember? You know, I am tired of your attitude. If this is what's happening, you're doing this. You got us into this trouble. You do it. You know what? Go home. You want me to go home? Yes. Your brothers will be home in an hour. You got what you wanted, now leave me alone. You're so ungrateful, I've had it. He hates me. Angela, he doesn't hate you. I'm the worst parent ever. I should have dealt with this better, I mean, I'm the grown up. Okay, you were standing up for yourself. You are allowed to have a bad day. Especially this bad day. I'd say this is the worst day ever, but that one's still coming. [phone ringing] Hey, It's your house. William? What's wrong? Are you kidding? What? Okay, alright. The flyers worked! William's getting e-mail orders! We're up to twenty one! Orders? Yes! We have twenty one orders? Yes! Aha! But it hasn't even been It hasn't even been twenty four hours. Oh my god. This could work. You said it. You said that this could work. I was lying Angela. I was totally lying! [laughter] I need more groceries! Please take me to the grocery store? Okay. Move over! Woman saving her house. Move over. I can't believe- Talk to me, okay? Okay. Let's get started. How do I help? You know what? I'm good. You're going to bake twenty one cakes by yourself? Okay. Don't take this the wrong way, but you're the worst cook I've ever met. Unbelievable. You know who's ungrateful? You. [voicemail] Hey, It's Melvin. Who's Melvin? He has a nice voice. What was the final decision on the apples cakes? I'm ready to help any time. You've got my number Call if you need me. Well when are we inviting Melvin over? You know what? You can go home any time. Haha, pretty cool, huh? We got like twenty one orders already. I know! Okay honey. Can you go out to Gloria's car and get the rest of the groceries for me please? Sure. Okay. You sure you can't let me help you? Seriously, I'm good. Alright. Thank you. Wait up! Nicolas? William. Have you seen Nicolas? Uh, he's probably at dad's. Hello, Bobby. Is Nicolas there? Yeah, well nice of you to let me know. Never mind that, just bring him home. You know what? That's none of your business. I'll expect to see him by six thirty. Sorry. Where's Nick? Baking cake? For my presentation this week in class, Mhm? I'm thinking of starting with a joke. Okay. Programming today is a race between- engineers trying to build bigger and better [doorbell rings] input programs, and the universe trying to produce. bigger and better idiots. Looks like the universe is winning... No no no. Don't. Dinner's ready. In the kitchen. Thanks dad. Anytime pal. What, no thanks? Seriously? He says you told him to get lost. It's none of your business. It is my business, If you can't provide for them. If you're so stressed out that you turn my son loose on the streets. It's not- The reason he was with me today is because you gave him a knife. I taught him responsibility with it. Well, he took the knife to school and got suspended! You could've told me what was going on. Maybe I could've helped. Why didn't you call me sooner? I don't know. Maybe chasing after you for six years for child support made me less interested in reaching out for your help. Should I go on? Why you got to be like that, huh? I got a job to turn things around. Thanks for bringing him home. Where's Nicolas? Turn it off! Turn it off! Now. No more locked doors, no more walking away. We have a problem, we talk. Even if we're pissed. Because we're all pissed and probably scared to death right now. But all we have is each other. We clear? Look, I'm sorry I got us into this. I'm doing everything I can to get us out. I'm trying really, really hard. [clapping] I'm Melvin George from Boston, Massachusetts, and I am not cool. I used to think that the National Guard was one guy. When the president said he was going to send the National Guard to watch the border, I wondered, how is this guy going to drive six thousand miles? [clapping and laughter from audience] Thank you. Thank you thank you. Hi. Thank you! I can't wait to share it with the staff! Oh, thank you Sheila! You've been great bringing cakes down here for years, it's about time we gave back. Mr. Leevie already put in his order for five. We will do whatever we can. Well, I am up to thirty eight so far. We'll keep pulling for you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you! Thank you so much. Can I. Can I talk to you? I'd like that. We should really- Dad said that if you lose the house, he wants me to move in with him. You don't want to live at home anymore? Even if I make tho work? You don't think I'm going to make it work. Mom, I didn't- We'll talk about it if that happens. Right now I have to bake more cakes. Actually, you don't. We're out of orders. There's nothing in the e-mail, no more messages on the answering machine. I even double checked on the charity's computers. Look mom, I'm sorry. I think we're all tapped up. Hey mom. I didn't see you this morning. Everything okay? I hope she deserves you. She's nice. I think you'll like her. Everything okay? I think It's over. We've reached everyone we can. What will happen now? Um, well, we've made one thousand, five hundred and twenty dollars, which is amazing. But there's only six days left, and twenty five hundred dollars to go. Don't tell your brothers. Or your dad. [doorbell rings] You said two weeks. I'm just checking on your progress. After two weeks, the bank will own the house. You can take it up with them. I understand that this is difficult- You know, I don't think you do. I'm taking the full two weeks. Now leave me alone! That's telling her. I just yelled at a city worker who just asking me for money I legitimately owe. So, even if I could pay it, which I can't, I don't have a sense of humour about any of this right now. Okay! Okay! I was just trying to cheer you up. And we're out of milk! My mom always said that candy tastes better when you're mad. I heard things slowed down. I came by to see if I could help. Hey, It's cold, why don't you get inside? The car is warm. Take the offer. I can put a message on my webpage. I have hundreds of fans. Eighteen hundred people on my social media page, Angela. What's the resistance here? My house is falling apart. This was my grandmother's house, and she willed it to my mother when she died. Because she believed, a women should have to be dependant on anybody to have a roof over her head. My mother kept it free any clear until I moved in with my boys on the hill of my divorce, and then she got sick. So we took out a mortgage for her hospital bills, and we took out a second for her funeral. I didn't sign up for a mortgage I couldn't afford. It didn't get it in over my head. I had a paid-off house and my mother got sick. Three generations of women, and I'm going to be the one who loses the house. You don't want any part in this. I got this bit that i did with champagne. Are you insane? I was saving it for something special. How is this any way that? Well, today is an extraordinary day. Things can't get any worse than this. Oh Melvin, things can always get worse. When it rains, it rains inside my house. What about when it hails? You'll use it as ice! Come on! Toast with me. Ah! Hahaha. Okay, okay. What are we toasting? Everything going up from here. Okay. Mm! Everything always crashes around me. It starts out good, like my house, my marriage, but it never ends well. So that's it? Never try again? Shop's closed? A real relationship doesn't have a chance because maybe it will go badly up. There's a lot of people having hard times lately. Just give me 'till my ten days are up. Why? I mean, what's going to be different? Not me, not how I feel. And not how you feel. or it will never be a good time for you actually. Angela! Well! What's going on here? What's going on? I need you to come with me, I think I may have found your saviour. Well, when your saviour comes, you go. Thanks. Mhm. Bye! See you later. So, his name is Herman, and you met him at the laundrimat? Even headshot reporters need clean clothes. 'Kay, here he comes, behave. Hi! Thank you so much for meeting with us. Angela, meet Herman. Herman, the amazing Angela. Look, he liked your story so much he's going to write about it in the record. What do you say? So, you're a reporter? Well, actually I work at the obituaries. Angela! No, it's perfect! You brought me to meet the Obituary writer you found at the laundromat. Well, I'm a real writer Ms. Logan. It's just the best job I could get on journalism school. It happens. Hey, you know about taking sub-part time jobs, right Ange? I think the record will print your story. It's a real human interest. It might get into Sunday's paper. Oh, see? So shut up! And be an optimist, because optimists live longer. Isn't that right? Yeah. Follow me. That was amazing! Right? Mark my words. You are going to be famous! You're going o be the woman who saved her house with cake. No, I'm going to be the woman that might might end up in the Sunday edition of a local minimart paper that people pick up for the coupons. Or, you could be happy. Everything could work out. Did you ever think of that? Laundromat, huh? Don't you have a washing machine at home? Haha! Maybe there's no single man at home. Glad you could make it Paul. Good to see you again. Lovely to see you too. So a starter. We like that! There wasn't much support from my family growing up, so I had to create it. She's an entrepreneur just like you mom. Oh, well I'm no entrepreneur. Mine's just plain old desperation. Mine too. And you're a great example for what it is to fight. I wish I had that growing up. She's a keeper. Angela! How lovely to see you. Thank you, Pastor. The Sermon was wonderful. Thank you. How goes the house? I could have mentioned it in the announcements. Next Sunday, okay? Thank you. Have you met Marcus' friend, Cicely? Hi. Nice to meet you. Mom, but Sunday it'll be too late. I picked up a paper. That was a waste of a buck fifty. Oh no, really? It's fine, no. I figured. I even looked for my name in the obituaries, It wasn't there either. So, there's that. Thank you for trying. Hey, don't give up. That was my last hope, and a long shot at that. Now I've got five days left, and a little over fifteen dollars. Now I've got to make a safety deposit in first month's rent somewhere. Bobby called. He heard about the cake sales from a few old friends. Guess what he wanted? Money. He's got a great new business venture. All he needs is ten thousand bucks, because even if I had the money, I wouldn't use it to save the house, put the kids through college, or pay some bills, or get a car. Give my boys the cushion they deserve. No! I would throw it down the money pit called Bobby Logan and hope for the best. I don't deserve you. Bye bye. [phone ringing] Apple Mortgage Cake. Yeah, wrong number. Mom, what will happen if we lose our house? Where will we live? I'm not sure honey. We'll figure something out. But let me ask you, How come you never asked to live with your dad? Have you ever thought about it? I don't know. I guess I just felt safer here. I'm going to go finish my homework. Hey Nicolas, how you doing? Alright. Uh, she's inside. I'll go get her. No no no. Don't bother. I just wanted to return this. Needed a bit of help, but I think it's got a chance now. Well, you don't want her to know that you brought it? No, I don't want her to uh, leave a hole in. You got kids? You know, I was never that lucky. Always wanted them, though. Hey, that's something. You're creative. Now, people don't know the half of what's inside you, do they? Do Do you want to sit down? Let me tell you, When I found this thing, I didn't think it was going to make it. But with a little bit of love, a little bit of water, anything can grow. Check this out! Mom's in the papers! What're you guys doing? Mom, you're in the paper! A whole story! Seriously? That's when I took on second jobs, third jobs, even took in borders. You remember that crazy lady? Her kids mow lawns, shovel snow, and grant errands. Man, so many errands. This is unbelievable! Okay okay boys. Start getting ready for school. I don't want you to be late. Especially you, Nicolas. [phone ringing] Mom's in the paper! Hello? This is? How'd you get my number? Um, sure. That would be So, you'll call me? Okay, i'll wait to hear from you. A news network is going to call at eight thirty and put me on their satellite. Are you kidding? [phone ringing] Hello? This is? You do? Uh The Midday News? The Midday News? That's huge man! Oh, no. I don't have a car. You're sending one? Okay. I'll see you at nine thirty. Mom [phone ringing] Wait, mom! Angela Logan. Channel 11? Uh, well, I guess I could. But I have to do the eleven thirty. Okay. Um. The five and six. Okay! I'll be here! Gloria. That's why everyone's calling! Mom, look. twelve, fifteen, eighteen, orders! [phone ringing] Apple Mortgage Cakes. Do we do bog orders? Angela! Angela! Come here! Uh, yeah! We do do bog orders. Gloria, what's going on? The news networks are calling like crazy! Well, you need to get yourself cleaned up. Because your limo has arrived. Oh my god! Okay, well let's get ready! Come on! Someone will be here in a sec. Just, uh, relax. This morning we're excited to welcome a very special guest. Angela Logan had been faced with an impending foreclosure on her family home, but instead, she fought back by baking her apple cake, which we have here, and selling it around town. Thank you for benign here. Thank you for having me. Now, just to set the record straight, you have four more days until the bank officially takes ownership of your home? That's right. You must have been panicked when you got the foreclosure notice. Yes, but we've been through hard times before, so I thought we'd get through it just like we always have. Where did the cake idea come from? Desperation. Now, in the middle of all of this, you have three teenage boys. How are they handling it? I have the most incredible young men. I don't know what I'd do without them. I'm so lucky. Not a lot of women in your situation would call themselves lucky. Well, I'm not the only one in my situation. At the charity I volunteer at, there's lots of women who have needs. It's like this all over New Jersey. All over the country. Wait, through all of this, you've been volunteering at a charity? Mhm. Mostly helping women getting back on their feet and apply for jobs. Other people's needs don't stop when you're in trouble, right? I made a commitment, and I'm sticking to it. Amazing. Well, I know a lot of other outlets want to feature you today. How would you describe what's happening right now? I'd say it's a miracle. Fifty seven orders? And still coming in. We directed them to your e-mail. And, your son, William, called. What did he say? Tell my mother over two hundred phone and e-mail orders have come in. Two hundred? Two hundred orders! How am I going to make two hundred cakes? I have an appointment at the charity! Charity- Wait You were serious about that? Yes, a woman I'm helping, she's got a big job interview and I told her I'd come! Okay, tell you what. The 11 News wants you for a segment tonight. Let us send you home and bring you back later. I don't know how to tell you this Angela, but your life is about to change. Follow me. Okay. Hello. Look, I'm not special. Really, I'm just like any other person struggling to make it work right now. Four thousand dollars may not seem like a lot of money to some people, but when you run other jobs, and you don't have family to borrow money from, you max out in the equity I have. There's organizations out there to help the homeless, but hardly any to help people about to lose their homes. Can you write about that? Everybody I know, they'd rather work for it. And sometimes, we just need a chance. Thanks for putting the word out. That's it, just Thank you. Boys. Three hundred and thirty two? Three hundred and thirty four now It was 254 when i left the stutio How many pounds of flour and apples- Mom don't worry about it. I can help you. How do I haul supplies for 334 cakes when I don't even have a car? How do I pay for the supplies, when I don't have a car and I don't get paid until I deliver 334 cakes. 342. Stop! Stop! Ugh. People are ordering out of sympathy, right? I was watching the news and I saw this woman I felt sorry for, so I said yeah, I'll spend $40, but I didn't mean it for a cake! Who spends $40 for a cake! You know that's what's going to happen right? What if the cakes were already paid for? What are you doing here? I called him We need the help mom Yeah. Melvin knows what to do, and we don't. We can even help sell things on the website, right Melvin? Yeah. we could set up call waiting and voice mail on your regular phone. Yeah because you don't have a cell phone. We can even help her set up an online account. Tell her Melvin! Yeah, people can deposit money into an internet account connected to your bank so that when you go shopping, there's money in the bank. Stone soup. Yeah and Melvin's a potato. Hey, I'm a potato. Wait, hold on. That's so not cool right? Right. Listen, all you have to do is deliver. What? Deliver. The cakes. The new ones. Where are they from? Alabama, New Mexico, Origin all over the country So far all the orders have come in from a 10 mile radius where we could drop them off or they could come pick them up You even got one from Canada! International too? How do you ship something internatioanlly? How do you keep a cake fresh? How do you keep it from getting smashed? How much do you charge for international shipping? This was just supposed to be a way to save the house- Which it's doing. I'm going to wind up in jail. Come on. For what? Fraud. Promising something I can't deliver. See. This is what always happens. First the amazing, and then the roof caves in. I told you, this is what always happens. Angela. Why are you here? Because you need it. Because. You need it. I sent you away. I know. But I am just a stubborn as you are. And you need help. Or would you rather figure it all out by yourself? The media. The logistics. The shipping. Packing. Filling old orders, new orders, shopping for supplies Or- would you rather make amazing cakes? And let everyone else figure out how to sell the around the world? While you save your house. Wasn't it about that? v You're a jerk. Yes I am. And you need me. Come on, say it. Say it! I need you. Yes! Yes you do. Today. Okay. Today I'm necessary So in that case, do you mind going to the store? Because I have- 392. 392 cakes to bake. Okay. While you're out, do you mind picking up a mixer? And a bowl or two? Yes ma'am. Put those ones together, we can send them at the same time That's money. We just got 20 We've got to change 212 to 220. How are you doing mom? Nice All good? What do you think it would taste like is he added raisens? What? I'm just being creative. Okay. Something smells good! Fortunately for you, I have my PhD in box making. Are you seriously doing okay over there? I'll figure it out. Hello? Hey Hi! Melvin! I'm Gloria Grant Melvin George Officially. Wait Melvin George. You're that comedian What comedian? You know. The one that you used to talk a lot about like 10 years ago You know what Gloria you can go home Okay. Thank you so much Nice to meet you. It was nice to meet you too. Thank you so much for brining all the supplies That is a man. You liked him. Nice to see you, goodbye now. It's not like that. You like me. I talked about you a hundred years ago Say it. I liked you, okay? Oh this is torture for you isn't it? Not really. Hmm. How should we celebrate? Do you know where city hall is? Why? You ready to get married? No! No I need you to take me down there, I need to pay my permits today. [Knock at door] Mrs. Crole Mrs. Logan. We're getting the permits filed today, so, we're good. Actually I'm here on a different matter. I brought you an order to cease and desist. You have to stop all baking in this home. Or I can shut your operation down, effective immediately Are you kidding? You're baking cakes out of your home. Cakes that you're selling to other people. She's doing it to save her house. From people like you. If you're baking cakes out of your home, that's a health code violation If you're selling cakes out of your home, that's a zoning violation. Failure to comply with the order can result in arrest, criminal prosecution, and fines. And permanently shutting down your opperation. This is a nice home. What is wrong with you? This woman pulled off a half miracle, why are you doing this? Okay look. The city doesn't know how you keep the kitchen clean which means you could poison someone. Not intentionally, probably. Find yourself a seperate kitchen. Get a license and food handler training, or they'll have to come and shut you down. Good luck with your cakes. It really smells good in there. I have to go! Where are you going? You've got 500 cakes to bake! Oh Angela we heard the news! You must be over the moon. What are you doing here? Oh I have an appointment with Lianne Your interview is this afternoon, your second interview- It's a big deal right? But you're famous. Don't you have to bake something or be on TV? I'm sick of hearing about me. I said I would be here to do this with you, so let's do it. Tell me about this gap in your work history here. It was a very hard time in my life But I got out. And I left behind the people that hurt me or held me back. I'm trained now, and I'm ready to work. I will work so hard you won't believe it. Everything about my life is different now. And it's going to stay that way. You're hired. I've never felt confident about anything before Not until you. How can I thank you? Hm. Get the job. And maybe don't hug your interviewer in the end Excuse me Angela, so sorry to bother you, you have a phone call. Hello? Come use our industrial sized kitchen that can handle up to 20 cakes at a time What? Angela, the Hilton hotel is on borad! Now the kitchen is approximately 1250 square feet, and includes a dry storage area. Now this is you're equipment. You've got 6 burner stoves here, You've got convection ovens here, you've got a bit walk in fridge. Three walk in freezers, Dry storage racks Over here you've got the stainless steel countertop, great for working on, and keeping it very clean that's no problem. That's a Ruxon mixer, with all the attachments. Now. We'll provide all the utensils you need, and over here we've got some airing racks, so when your cakes come out of the oven you can put 'em on there for cooling down That's where you put your cakes when they come out of the oven. We've also cleared some shelf space, so you can place all your cakes here until they're ready to be shipped out. Always remember to cool before frosting. That's right. Now, is there anything else you need before you get started? Smelling salts? What you need are more supplies. Oh there's one more thing. Welcome Chef. Time to cook! With just days to save her house, Angela Logan cooked up a new recipe for success. A new bake sale in Jersey. Cut it out, both of you. A woman with a new perscription. An apple a day, keeps the banker away. Of you guys, It's past 10 o'clock, I've gotta buzz. I'm gonna take you home. It's okay. I'll stay here and finish this. Yeah? Yeah. You two. Behave. By mom. By honey. Thank you. Thank you so much. When's the last time you took a break? So, does this feel like home? You live in a hotel, right? That's the road. Home cooking is always better. Look I'm not good with thank you's. Please, you can barely ask for thanks. You've been shopping, and helping with the kids. Arranging local deliveries, telling jokes. Those bad jokes! Oh I never said bad. At first I thought you might be in it for the money. Yeah because when we ran into eachother last week, you were rolling in it. But then I realized you're just a very kind man. I'm - I don't know how to- Shhh. Don't ruin it. You don't know what I was going to say. Oh some song about how everything goes bad right after it goes good Sing a new one. Well. That is what happens to me. Your house is going to be paid for. The boys can stay in school. That think you said about doing something that you love, and being able to give back. This could be it. What's the bad part? I guess I just don't know how to trust it. I was married. From about a year after we dated till about 4 years ago. To a woman who didn't believe in me. Even as I was making a career as a comedian, and supporting us. But she couldn't find it in herself to be believe it could last. I could never go through that again. Melvin. Because I see so much better in you. This has only been- a week. I know. But this isn't our first time at this rodeo. I want to be here next week. And the week after that. And the week after that, and I think you do too. So what if you believed you deserve everything that's been happening to you, and could keep it. What if you celebrated it, instead of being afraid of it Because if you give doubt and fear that much power they are so hungry they'll eat you alive. Let's go somewhere? We're in a hotel, let's get a room. I can't. I've got a credit card. I can't. No I understand. You can just, um You could sleep, or we could just hold eachother, or just be somewhere private. You know we haven't had any privacy, just you an me. I've got 800 cakes to bake. That's just and excuse. I can't. Can't today, or just can't? Angela? Melvin you are the most amazing man I have ever met. I've never- Dan? You can't do it can you? You can't get over? You have faith in everybody but yourself. You always will. And that's too bad, because you are so worth believing in. And you are. Melvin- Good luck Angela The refrigerator if full, these boxes won't fit. Are you sure they won't fit? Mom, we've been cooking all night, that's over 500 cakes. There's no more room in the fridge. If we don't get these out by tomorrow they'll spoil. That's thousands of dollars. v I don't know wat to do. You'll figure it out. You always do. How? I have talked to dozens of shippers and accountants and lawyers and financial people tell me I need a copyright, to be incorporated and documented and insurance, but they can't insure me, but hey call this person or call that person, and worse, now that everone's seen me on TV- they think you're rich. Everybody want's a piece of me. I need someone who's been through this before. Mom that's Melvin. Honey it is 2:30 in the morning, you need to get some rest You've got school in the morning. Can I just ice these cakes? I've got it. Please, mom? I've got it. Thank you. Okay. Goodnight sweetheart Goodnight mom Thank you I'm greatful. I am. But I've got to get these out. Please don't strand me now. Take me all the way. I can't do it by myself Take me all the way I need help I do. I need help Help me Please help me There's your mom. Mom! Mom wake up. William Yeah. It's stone soup. Stone soup. C'mon I'll show you. This is for the Jhonson car, they're going to Philly, And next are the Larkins going to Rochester. Hey! Angela! We dcided to help you anyway Instead of waiting for you to ask, because that'll happen never. I've been looking for you. I can't believe this- We have a phone call to make Follow me What are you talking about? Okay, there are Broklyn right? I got the job! Guess who hired me? Bake me a Wish. Bake me a Wish? What's Bake me a Wish? They distribute cakes all over the world. Angela, you don't have to worry about national shipping anymore. What are you talking about? When they asked me the "Who do you look up to?" question, I told them you. Because you're baking a million cakes to save your house. And you still came to the charity to help me. Because you're the kind of person and employee I wanted to be. And now they want to talk to you about distributing your cake. What's going on? You're not going to believe this. Yes, hi. This is Leanna Dops May I speak with Mr. K.? Yes, he's waiting for my call. It's Mr. K., The CEO Hello? Mrs. Logan! It's Josh K. Leanne Dobs told us all about you. And of course I didn't have to look very far to see your story on the news. If you're interested, I would love to propose a collaboration. A collaboration? Yes, you see. Bake me a Wish ships cakes globally, so we can absorb all the cake's that you've made, and ship them out to the people who have already paid for them Put it on speaker phone Then if you're willing to share your recipe with us, we could bake it in our kitchens, let you taste test them, And then get out the rest of the orders that are coming in. Our publicity department could take over the calls that are coming in and they could put you in the media for at least 10 more days. We could do the legal on the business, the liability insurance, and of course if you want a lawyer, then you should have one. we could start baking in our facilities by beginning of next week. How? We also have another idea, Mrs. Logan, We woud actually like to do 5 cakes, all from you. In addition to your Apple Mortgage Cake, we'd like to do a Christmas cake, a New Years cake, a Valentines day cake, and a Mother's day cake. Also cooking segments and speaking engagements, so you can talk about being an entrepreneur, and your stone soup model. Why? Because you are a visionary, Mrs. Logan. This is the right time and the right place for exactly this. A visionary? Me? Because of a cake? No, because of you Angela. Yeah why do you think they keep putting you on the news mom? Everybody loves you mom. People are dying for a story like yours. The woman who wouldn't give up, who found a way to keep her home in spite of everything. I'm sorry! This is so embarassing. It's just when you're dealing with so much, life and a house and three boys, you never imagine You never imagine. You have no idea what your actions cause in others. Because you helped me and you didn't give up This happened. Bake me a Wish will work with our community outreach arm, to partner up with an organization that will do the kinds of things that you've been talking about. Keeping people in their homes. We can offer 5% of the profits from every cake sold, so that other people can get the help that they need. Angela, what do you say? Yes. YES! Great, good. We're very excited to be in business with you. Congratulations Angela, we'll be back in touch very soon. Thank you! Mom it worked! Oh and I changed my mind, I want to stay at home. Okay. Is everything going to be ok? I guess I'll have ot believe it will. Who would have guessed so much could happen on a Thursday morning? It's Thursday! I have to go- can I get a ride home? Can somebody give me a ride? I need my cheque book! Mom - this is amazing. Let me take a photo? Okay Alright Say cheese! Cheese! Let me take that. Put this in the envelope. I didn't think you would come. You've got something to say Well there's this plant, you believed in. Same one I thought would die, just like all my other plants. But I kept buying plants, so I must have hoped something would grow. Right? I don't know what that means. It means I'm sorry. It means I was an idiot. And I pushed you away, when I should have believed the things you told me were true. Wihtout your help, I don't know where we would have been these last 10 days. The things inside you you're amazing. You just don't know. When the walls keep crashing in on you, and everything always falls apart, It's hard to trust that anything or anyone good will stay. I don't want to do everything by myself anymore I'm asking - Will you give me a second chance? Will you stay by my side? Maybe you do the baking and I'll do the gardening? How are you at mailing letters? Well I'm a potato, right? Oh yes, way cooler than the onion. I think she'll make it. She's going to be ok. I think so.
