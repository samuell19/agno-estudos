(Wings flapping) (Wistful music) - You're a lovely lass, you are. They play, but without joy, huh? Can sense it in the air. Sadness. But you're a spry little thing still, aren't ya? How can you still be smiling, when the world is full of so much blue? Happiness like yours has no place left in the world now, deary. - Stop your night dreaming, farr darrig, you're too prone to sullenness, you are. - Can you blame me? Soul of the world's gone dead. Black as pitch in its heart, I know you can feel it. Don't tell me can't. There's no more innocence left to be had. - We've been called back by the ancient magic. - So why the long faces? We finally got ourselves a purpose. A mission. - We don't know who's callin' us, or why. Things is unclear. We don't know what we're headin' into. - It's been a long time since we've been up top. - Don't bring me down now me bucko, we got ourselves a reason for gettin' up in the morning. - We should send bloody bones up first, have a look around. - What say you, bloody? - Aye. - Then it's settled. We'll send him up first, have a wee little looksy. (Cries out) (Gloomy waltz music) (Birds singing) (Girls chattering) - [VOICEOVER] Wow. - Well, ladies, in a word, caca. - Don't listen to him girls, that was great. But since we are half way through the competition, you could add a tad more sass to your step, okay? There are cameras all over this mansion, recording everything you say and do, so I know there's some spunk and funk up in there. - Uh-huh, I can smell it from here, actually. - Um-hm. - Girls, you're the top five, you can't expect us to watch some half-assed runway show. - Who are calling half-assed? - See, now that is the attitude that we're looking for. Where was all that piss and vinegar when you were sashaying up and down the runway? (Laughs) - You're right, I got it, it'll be better next time. - Yeah, better do better. - Just be your normal bitchy self, you'll be fine. - What did you say? - Oh, I'm sorry, are you deaf? I hear that happens when you get older. - You bitch. - Hey, hold up, hold up. Knock it off, hold up. Knock it off, knock it off. - This is great for ratings. - Ah. - Oohh, don't get me wrong, attitude is good, toughness is good, but you ladies need to focus, keep your eyes on the prize, okay? You have to stay focused. This competition is nothin' compared to the real world, alright? I've been around a long time, and I made it through the tough times because I stayed focused. I never would have gotten seven platinum records if I just sat on my Booty, you know. (Laughter) And my talk show would not be number one in syndication if I sat at my house gettin' fat and lazy, right? My proudest achievement so far, is this new line of goth lingerie, alright. Deedee's delights, please forget about that Victoria's secret nonsense. Men do not want their women fluffy and nice and angelic. They want dangerous, nasty women, women who are fierce and bold and aggressive. Women who can take whatever the world throws at them. Am I right, girls? - [Group] Um-hm, yep. - Enthusiasm girls. - [Group] Yes. - Yes, yes, that's what I'm talkin' about. I'll see you ladies tonight. Oh, and I have a special surprise in store for the winner of tonight's challenge. - I'm just telling all you girls right now, I'm gonna win that contract. - [VOICEOVER] Please, you wish. - There's nothing any of you bitches can do to stand in my way. - Fuck you. - Okay, retract the claws, the little kitty claws, okay. Now we're gonna be judging your tapes of your tramp walkway session later, and deedee said she has a surprise for the winner. I also have a surprise, but it's for the loser. - Ah, pirl, your l's backwards. - Oh, goody it knows it's alphabets, that's nice. - You sure don't. - Okay that's not funny. I contracted dyslexia seven times, okay. It's a disease, and it's serious. Anyway, now, the loser of the tramp walk is going to be on bathroom duty. - [Group] Eww. - Yeah, you gotta get down on your hands and knees and scrub the toilets like a good little maid. Don't miss the brown parts. - [Group] Ew. - Oh please, like any of you little twits ever did a day's chore in your life. - What's a chore? - Look girls, we're all here to help you. So if any of you need a little extra anything, or a big extra something, please come see me for some one-on-one tutoring. My door's always open. - Yes, and so is his fly. Alright, go on ladies, go on. - Can't believe Darla, thinking she's got this in the bag. - She's confident, that's for sure. - She's arrogant. - She's beautiful. - I don't know what it is with you, but she's no hotter than me or you. - Well I'm just saying, give her some credit. - This isn't a beauty contest, deedee's looking for her next spokesperson, and this is a competition, you can't be so generous, you gotta be more cutthroat. - Well I'm not like that, is all. - Boy don't I know it. Look, you're like a square peg, tryin' to fit in a round hole around here, little miss innocent. - Oh please. - No really, I don't think you've taken one drink since you've gotten here. Not even one. You're not an undercover narc are you? - Heck no. - Heck, you don't even swear (laughing). (Scary music) What is it, what's what? What is it, girl? - It's nothing, I'm just getting stressed I guess. - See, right about now that 420 would come in handy. I'm just sayin'. (Haunting music) - What's happened to the world since we've been away? - It's a hideous place, I've been sayin' so all along. - It wasn't always, no sir, there was a goodness in it once. Innocence. - But who's callin' us, which one of 'em has the magic? - The question we should be asking, is which one is strong enough to handle such devil power? - You remember back in the old days, we would be summoned to do all manner a nasty business, hey? - Revenge, punishment, retribution, petty human squabblings. - We got fed up with it, scattered those four magic stones across the earth, figuring whoever was strong enough to find them, and bind them together, might be worthy of our help. - But maybe he ain't callin' us to do good. - Aye, maybe, but I'm beginning to think whoever is using the magic is strong, but maybe not so good, huh? - Aye. - Witch, warlock, evil they are, callin' us up for nefarious purposes. - We got to come when we're called. - Aye. (Birds singing) - [Voiceover] You think I'm putting on weight? - Um. - I mean, it looks like I'm putting on weight. Nothing scares me more than being fat. Some people are scared of heights, some scared of drowning, whatever, me, nope, I never wanna be fat and ugly. Is that a stupid thing to be scared of? - Very. Try wanting to be a model with Asian parents that want nothing less than a neurosurgeon. Fear is eight years of intense schooling, if I don't take home that prize money. So, yeah, that's very silly. Fuck, my signal's gone. - Hey, no bars, what's up with that? - That's weird, same with mika. - Oh, were you on a 911 call to your stylist, because that weave is all kinds of ratty. - Weave? - Um-hm, oh I'm sorry, it must've been the plastic surgeon about your butt implants. - Oh, well at least I wasn't on the phone to my pimp. - Funny, bitch, actually I was on the phone with my manager. We've got big deals in the works. I'm gonna be a star after this is over, unlike you rejects. - You know what, Darla? - [Darla] Huh? - You remind me of a four letter word that is used to describe an annoying woman and an uber bitch. It ends in u-n-t. Can you guess the first letter? - Oh, pick me, I know this. - No really, can you guess? - Don't you dare go any further unless you wanna look like you just went on a bad date with Chris brown. - It's a. You really need to meet my aunt Connie, she's really annoying, she's an uber bitch, kinda like you, except for I had a different first letter in mind for you. - You know what, it looks like you're really putting on the pounds there girl. - Ah! - Later, bitches. (Scary music) (Crickets chirping) (Girls chatting and laughing) - I knew I'd find you here looking over the ladies, you horny devil. - Ha, ha, ha, ha, maybe this world ain't such a bad place after all. - You're perverted, you are. - Tis been a long spell and the underworld's a lonely place, mate. - Don't I know it. (Laughing) - Alright ladies, we've reviewed your runway video and your photos, and I think pirl might have something to say. - Yeah, I for one say, fabulous. - You're looking fine, Darla, you really know how to show off the lingerie girl. You know exactly what this is about, very nice. - You look good out there, but you're just a little clunky. - Erin, you have the right look for us, but you've gotta be more fluid honey. - Yeah, you're kind of like a robot. - No, I think she's got something. In print ads, you would look fantastic. - I think you need to take your sunglasses off. - What a grotesque spectacle this is. - Sheila honey, oh yeah, you're good, and gorgeous, just stunning. But we need... - ah, the emphasis on but, with your fantastic amazing butt, it's huge. (Giggles) - Audrey, I'm sorry honey, this just isn't your finest moment. - Deedee, you're being a little too kind. Audrey, what happened, what happened out there today? This whole time I've been rooting for you. The good girl, little miss goody two-shoes against all these other girls, I mean you've been on the speed train to the win, girl. What happened today? Conductor started twittering, missed the red light and then kapuu, train wreck girl. - Sorry, Audrey. - A wee bit a the old country flows through her, no doubt. - Mika, um, let me just say, these two will have their own opinions, I mean that' why they're on the show, but as far as I'm concerned, you owned that runway today girl, you rocked it. I don't think we have to consult on this, you win the challenge, diva. Congratulations, and, of course we have a special surprise in store for you. Get plenty of sleep tonight, honey, because tomorrow you have a solo photo shoot with none other than the world famous photographer, McGregor. He is world-renowned for shooting all over the world and shooting everybody, including all seven of my cd covers and catalogs. Congratulations, diva. - Thank you. - Handle it, pirl. - Okay, Baxter, anything you'd like to say before I finish up? - And mika, for an extra bonus, I'm offering you a private consultation in my chambers. - Yeah, well, there you have it. - And as deedee mentioned earlier, I have a little something for the loser. Yeah, don't forget the brown parts. - I'll see ya later, bones. - Where are ya goin'? - I've got somethin' to do, me blood's up. - But we haven't been ordered yet. - Hell, we don't even know who's contollin' the magic, and until we do, I'm gonna have a bit of fun, uh. (Tense music) - Oh my, oh my god, what... (Haunting music) Ancient magic mama mother, heal my pain, set me free, make my pretty. Ah, pure gold, never ugly, never old. Ancient magic mama mother, make me fearless, make me bold, take my blood, take my soul. Ancient magic mama mother, set me free, make me pretty, pure gold, never ugly, never old. - Where does pirl get off telling me that my butt looks big? I mean, what does that little homo know anyway? Sorry, was that racist? And Darla, that stuck up bitch is always going off on me. I don't understand. She's no better than I am. She wants to bring it, oh I'll bring it. I'll win that contract and rub it in her snotty little face. That's all I got. - Um. (Tense music) - I'll teach you to be so fine to the ladies. Gamora. Faith and gamora. If it isn't Sheila herself. - How do you know my name? - Oh girly, I know many, many things, I do. The name's farr darrig, the red man, and it's my job to know things. Like I know about you, for instance. - What do you mean? - Well, let's see, your name's Sheila. You grew up here abouts, and I'm guessing, when you were a youngun, you were a chubby little thing, is that right? Aye, a chubby little girl, bouncin' on daddy's knee. And maybe a wee little bit more than bouncing, eh? - You creep. - All your life, you've been tryin' not to be that chubby little girl anymore. Tryin' not to be the apple of daddy's eye ever again. - You're horrible, you've no idea what you're talking about, my father was not like that. - Oh, it's not a good idea to lie to farr darrig, dear. - I'm not lying. - Yes you are you naughty girl. (Cries out) (Screaming) I told ya, I know all about ya. (Crying out) It's not easy to keep your weight is it, I know. (Screaming) (Melodic bells) Sorry girly, I had me orders. Now, where's your spirit going? Who's after your soul? (Haunting music) (Crickets chirping) - Hello? (Tense music) Hello? Hello? Where is he? - I'm right here, sugar. - Jeez bax, why do you have to scare me like that? I'm nervous enough as it is. - Why are you nervous? - Because I don't wanna get caught, that's why. - You're not gonna get caught, there's no cameras down here. I made sure of it when I set up the place. - Wait, you don't take any of the other girls down here, do you? - No, you're the one and only. - You wouldn't be lying to me, would you? - Producers never lie, sugar. - So this will help me win, right? - You got it in the bag, honey. - And that green card? - One thing at a time. - Hey, they shoulda made you clean that with your tongue. - Very funny. - Why don't you just give up? I mean you don't really stand a chance against me anyway. What are you even doing here? You're not really the type. Let's face it, you're just not model material, no offense. - Well I don't wanna be a model. - Then what are you doing here? This is a modeling competition, duh. - No, it's a spokesperson competition, I just wanna prove something to myself, you know, that I'm not that gangly girl that I used to be, that I could pull it off. - You, please. - And, if I win the contract, then the money'll help me pay for my student loans. - Oh you're a college girl, should I be impressed? - I'm not trying to impress anybody, I'm jut thinking ahead. You know there are more important things in life than just modeling, no offense. - So, what are you studying, college girl? - Business major. - Oh that's perfect, because you're in a bathroom cleaning toilets, and the economy's in the toilet. (Laughing) Notice how you said "if I win," not "when I win," that just proves you don't have the confidence to pull it off. - Well that doesn't mean I'm just gonna quit. - It's your funeral. - Well what are you gonna do when you don't win? Notice I said "when you don't win," not "if." - I'm not stressing it. - No, I'm serious, what are your plans if this whole modeling thing doesn't work out for you? - See, that's what I'm talking about, backup plans are for losers. - You know I almost feel sorry for you, Darla, not having anything in your life but this. Almost. - Whatev. - Good luck tomorrow, Darla, you're gonna need it. - Yeah, right, have fun scrubbing toilets, loser. Ttfn, ta ta for now. (Slow graceful music) (Moaning) - Your visa status is cinched. - Visa, I want full citizenship. - That could be trouble. (Moans) Not a problem. Whoa, I'm not sure what happened, I just blacked out and I came to, and, what the fuck? - Bax? (Laughing) (Screaming) - What the fuck? - Oh my god, oh my god, oh. (Heavy panting) Oh my god, oh my god. (Laughing) Oh, what just happened? - I don't know. - I think uh, you and me were... - Nice, very nice, very nice, good, good, good. I'm not seeing the curves enough. There we go. Nice, nice, now a little fierce, more, give me a little bit more, perfect, perfect. That's it, little bit more to the left. Nice. That's it, that's it, work it. Beautiful, don't fall. Good. Perfect. Let's seem more of that, perfect, perfect. - Mika, mika, sell it honey. Come on, I can't have you walking out here looking like you just got outa some - good, good. Afterparty half drunk. - Let me get a little less Jennifer Lopez, and a little bit more George Lopez, please. Thank you. - Honey, honey, your hands, your hands, can you fly, no. Put 'em down okay, just keep 'em down. I know, I know, just takes work to make it look natural, that's all. - Pay no attention to the chirping bird honey, you're doing great. Good, good. You are doing beautiful, there we go. - She looks great out there. - Okay see, that's loser talk. You're not gonna win this competition by being nice. - Yeah, but she doesn't have to be a bitch either. - Oh really, and where were you last night? - No where. - Somewhere, because unless you went to bed after me, woke up before me, and made your bed, there wasn't a wrinkle in your sheets. So where were you? - None a your business. - Oh, you know, we're really not suppose to be outside our rooms at night. - So are you gonna tell on me, tattletale? - I don't know, what's it worth to keep quiet? - Nothing, there's nothing to keep quiet. I was with Audrey last night, we were just talking late. - Oh really? - Um, yeah, she was in my room. - Don't tell me that you two have a little something going on, I mean I never would have expected that from you Audrey. - Expected what? - Oh you know, little miss innocent, with a taste for. - You're disgusting. - Whatever, I'll have my eye on both you two. - Very nice, very nice, a little bit more gaga, less Lohan, there we go. Like that, little bit more pouting lips, there we go. Perfect, that's the calendar shot right there. - Oh really, awesome. - Mika, it was nice, but don't get ahead of yourself, remember deedee is the final judge, and she's the jury. She'll judge you. - Good, good, good, lower. - Oh, hi. - Hi. - Whatcha guys doin'? - Snacking. - You shouldn't be snacking, you know eating causes fat. Fat causes death, death to models, to you. The sad truth, has anyone seen Sheila? You don't know, haven't seen her. Do me a favor, fatty, could you find your friend for me? - Okay. - Bye. - Bye bye, faster. (Scary music) - Oh! Oh, it's so fuckin' loose, it's not lasting. - The future is grim, I talk not to figure out banshee, I talk of us. - I had to take one of 'em last night. I didn't want to. - Aye yeah. - She wasn't a bad one, but I was ordered I had no choice. Who is it, who has the charms? Still no idea? (Mumbles) I get ya. Whoever it is must be desperate. The magic's not working for them like it used to. It's 'cause they're abusin' it. Using it for selfish reasons. It's as I feared, the world's no better than it was before. - There's cameras all over this house, one of them musta seen her. Ah, ha, and there she is standing outside the confession cam. - Where does pirl get off tellin' me that my butt looks big? I mean, what does that little homo know anyway? - Oh. - Sorry, was that racist. - Look it was almost 10 o'clock. - Oh very good, Watson, now let's bring her coming out at 10... (Creepy music) What's she doing? - It looks like she's talking to someone. - [Audrey] Yeah, but who? - What is this, flinstones hi-tech? - That is so weird, it's like she just - disappears. - She doesn't just disappear, shit, it's just static. - No, and not one other camera caught her. - Well why would she just leave? - She wouldn't just leave, she wanted to win this just as much as the rest of us. - Oh well, good riddance to her. That's just one less bitch I have to trample on my way to the top. - Oh my god, you are such a bitch. - Um-hm. - Well, the plot thicks. - It's really very simple, if Sheila doesn't show up by sundown, the sheriff's gonna kick her fat ass outta town. And the same applies to any of you who plays hooky on my watch, got it? Now, we're gonna have ourselves a little easter egg hunt before the next challenge. Somewhere in around this mansion, there's a golden egg laid by our favorite goose, I mean pirl, naturally. It looks like this, there's only one, and for the girl who finds it, it will save you from elimination next round. I don't want anybody helpin' anybody else, not that any of you would anyway. No teams, no alliances, Every girl for herself, go. - Deedee, we need to go over all these. - Not now. - Wow, someone's got their diva on. I was talking about her, not you. (Suspenseful music) - Ancient magic mama mother, heal my pain, set me free, make me pretty, like pure gold, never ugly, never old. Ancient magic mama mother. (Buzzing) - Of course, where else could it be? - Get outta here, look in your own room. - I already did, it's not there. - Bitch. (Buzzing) - Oh my god, yes. - Hello darlin' - oh my god. - Don't mind her, that's what she does when someone's about to die. - Die? - Sorry, just doing me duty. (Screams) (Screams) (Loud buzzing) (Heavy breathing) (Suspenseful music) (Curious music) - Hey, I'm looking in here. - Not anymore, I'm taking over. - Well be my guest, it's not in here anyway. - So you say, I'll just take over from here, beat it. - What is your problem. - No problem. - The heck there isn't, you've been dogging me from the get go. - It's nothing personal, I just wanna win. - Well we all wanna win, but that's no excuse to be such a witch about it. - (Laughs) A witch? - Come on, what is it? (Scary music) It's just you and me now Darla, there's no cameras, so you don't need to huff and puff and act all tough, okay, 'cause this convo of ours isn't even gonna be on the show. So why don't you just tell me what's been bugging you. - Who says anything is bugging me, aside from you that is. - That's what I'm talking about, why me? - Maybe I'm just trying to get under your skin, it looks like it's working too. - (Laughs) Really, do I look like it's working? Why me? - Maybe it's because you're my biggest competition, that's why. - Wow, you know I never thought I'd hear you say that anything was competition for you. - Well now you've heard it, big whoop, don't let it get to your head, it doesn't mean you're gonna win this thing, I still need to win this. - You need to? Why, why do you need to win this? - Because my brother's sick, okay. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - My family can't afford the medical bills and that's why I would do anything to win this, and I need to win this, are you satisfied now? - No I'm not satisfied, your bother is sick, why would I be satisfied? It's gonna be okay. - Thanks, now get outta here before I kick your ass. - I told you the egg isn't in here. - Get. - Showtime. - Are you kidding me, none of you could find the egg? What is wrong with you nitwits, and where's Erin? - Who cares? - Maybe she found it. - Oh really, well then why isn't she here rubbing it all over your slightly Asian face. Of course she hasn't found it, she's not any brighter than the rest of you idiots. Even my four retarded uncles could have found that golden egg, it's right here, under the grapes. Oh my. - Maybe she did find it. - Yeah and she figures she can't get eliminated. - See, I knew she was fucking around somewhere. She's hanging out with someone. - Well it's not me, I told you that. - Who, then, you think she's hookin' up with Baxter? - You jackals are just constantly giving me a migraine, I can't stand it. - Of course she found the egg, I've already talked to the girl. - Where is she then? - She's getting a makeover, courtesy of yours truly. And there is a makeover in the cards for one of you girls too. But first I need to find out how much you've learned. So I want you to go get yourselves made up. Do your hair, choose some lingerie, and I'll spend some one-on-one time with each of you, see how far you've come, give you a few tips along the way. 30 minutes, go, go, go. - Dee... - what is it? - Well this wasn't suppose to be... - it is if I say it is. Who's runnin' this ship anyway? - I am, look I'm the producer, somebody needs to tell me about these things. Toughen up. - Suck my dick. (Melodious bells) (Scary music) (Laughing) - Hey mika, can I borrow one of those daggers? Mika? - Huh? - Are you okay? - Hm, yeah, yeah. - Okay, well I just wanted to borrow one of the daggers, if you're not using 'em, of course. - Yeah, yeah. - Cool, thanks. - Make-up looks good, hun. Could use a little less around the eyes, your eyes are so stunning, you don't need to use so much liner. - Your makeup looks good today, pirl. - Thanks. - Disappointing. - It'll be better next time, I swear. - Um-hm. - Not the right choice of shoes. Fuck me pumps would have worked better. Remember, there's no subtlety with this line, girl. We sell the sizzle and the steak. - Deedee I promise you, if I win this contract I will be the best model you've ever had. I will bust my ass 24/7 for this. I would do almost anything. - That's probably true. - Anything. - Um-hm. - Well. - Nice. - Nice, I was kinda hopin' for hot. - How badly do you wanna win this competition? - Really, really bad. - You're a beautiful girl, but I'm not sure you have what it takes to be one of deedee's devils. - What do you mean? What can I do to improve, like my pose, or my walk, my makeup? - I'm talkin' about in here. You're selfless, not selfish. - I would think that's a good thing. - In this business, it isn't. You really have a good soul, don't you? - Um, I guess. Are you okay, deedee? - I'm just fine. - Well, your face. - Oh hell. (Tense music) (Suspenseful music) (Screaming) - Hey didn't you guys notice something weird about deedee today? - This whole fucking thing is getting weird. - Yeah, I mean, what happened with Sheila and Erin anyway? And don't you even say, "oohh, that's less competition for me." - There is no competition for me, girl. - You know what I mean, something is going on. - Don't say a word. I know I look like Jim Carey from the mask, and I don't care who sees it. - What's going on pirl, aren't we suppose to have another challenge or judging? - As far as I'm concerned this show is so over. - Where's deedee? - That's the question of the hour, where's deedee? Diva's been holed up in her room, won't come out for nothin'. - Well she did seem odd, that's for sure. - Pirl just cannot handle this drama. - Oh look, pirl's talking about himself in the third person, this must be really bad. - Heal my pain, set me free, make me pretty. Like pure gold, never ugly, never old. Never ugly, never old, never ugly, never old. Take my blood, take my soul, ancient magic mama mother. Ancient magic mama mother, heal my pain, set me free, make me pretty, like pure gold, never ugly, never old. Ancient magic mama mother, heal my pain, set me free, never ugly, never old. Out this, never ugly, never old. Ancient magic mama mother, heal my pain, take my blood, take my soul, take my blood, take my soul, take my blood, take my soul, take my blood, take my soul, take my blood, take my soul, take my blood. (Eerie music) - No, the magic, the magic. (Haunting music) - What's wrong, we've done everything you've ordered. - Somebody took the charm bracelet, and I know it wasn't one of the girls. - Well it wasn't me, I can tell ya that. - I need that bracelet, have you taken a good look at me lately? - Aye, your dirty and greed magic itn't workin', it's gettin' weaker. - I need that bracelet. - It's 'cause you've used it for selfish reasons. That's why the magic's not workin' for you the way it used to. - You're gonna tell me where that bracelet is. - I'm tellin' ya, I don't know. - Then it's gonna be a long night. (Screaming) - Not done yet, me thinks. Lots to do, lots to do. Pookah! Let him be, ya bitch. - Well, well little man, gettin' high and mighty aren't we? - Let him go. - You're not the one givin' the orders, I am. - Not anymore. - You stepped over the line, baby boy. - I can't abide what you're doing. Stealing souls, feasting on youth so you don't age, it's not right. - I don't give a shit what you think. I got the magic now, I'm in charge, now you do what I say. - No. - You have any idea how long it took me to get all those charms? I spent every dollar I had, every dollar I earned, every resource. I had to search the world for decades lookin' for them, and I finally found them all. The ancient magic says I'm in control now. - The ancient magic wasn't meant for such selfishness. Long ago we used to help people, heal the sick, toppled kings, ended wars. - But for what side? Whichever side held the magic. Maybe you helped the bad guys win, you ever think a that? - Maybe you're right, but when you get to a certain age you learn a few things, and I know what you're doin' is wrong, what you're makin' us do is wrong. - After all these centuries you got a conscience. Give it to me. - No. - Give it to me. - Now I'm in control, you do what I say. - Ah! - Sorry deary, I didn't mean to frighten ya. - Get out of here. - Don't worry, it'll all be over soon. - What, what will be over soon? Who are you? - My name's farr darrig, the red man. No point in tryin' to leave deary. - What do you want? - Not much, just your heart. I'm sorry girl, I've got to do it. (Noise drowns out voice) - You have the old country, on your mother's side I reckon. Kin, you're a decent soul deary, ya are. Now, go, get the others, get out while you can. - But, what's going on? - Go, damn you, go. - Come on, we gotta go. - What are you talking about? - What's wrong? - Just hurry, we have to get out of here. - Somebody needs to take a chill pill. - I mean it, let's go. - Okay, good enough for me. - Damn it. - Why are we trying to leave, exactly? - Pirl, you just have to believe me, okay, we've gotta get out of here. (Gasping) - What the devil is goin' on? - The magic, I ain't doin' it, mate. Not what that witch wants, I ain't. - You're causing trouble for yourself, for all of us. - Aye, and if you want to stop me, I wouldn't blame you for a minute. - We're with you, mate. - Hey that's the creep that was spying on me. - Calm 'em down, bones. - Be peaceful me Lasses, we'll have ya out of here in a jiffy. - No, nobody's going anywhere. She's the one I want, her heart is pure. - You're not getting her, nor anyone else, not tonight. Not ever. Bones. I won't do what you say, never. - That's the way you wanna play, let's play. (Groaning) - No! (High-pitched screaming) (Screaming) - No, give it to me. - No. - Give it to me. You don't know what you're doing, you don't understand the power. - It's already caused so much pain, so much hurt. - Give it to me, you... (high-pitched screaming) - I did good, I think. - You did friend, you did. - You woulda won this, you would. - I did. - Aye. A free lass you are. (Wistful flute music) (Playful haunting music) - The underworld's a lonely place, mate.
