Thank you, Brier. - You're welcome. - You can always count on him. Bramble, I'll tell you what; If you can clean this mess up in 10 minutes I'll make it worth your while. I'll get you some ice cream. - Ice cream! (bright upbeat music) The last bucket!

My tummy's talking, he says that we need ice cream first. - No way, you have to clean all this up first. - Just relax, Vick. Bramble tried his best, I can take care of cleaning this up. - Yay! Thanks Briar, you're the best! Ice cream, here I come! - Watch where you're going! - [Bramble] Even though real life wasn't quite like I wanted it to be, I was still having a pretty good time with all my friends until trouble fell from above and changed everything.

Just go back to your own planet. - I'm trying to, I have no ship. All right, you're not the brightest so try to understand more of those soldiers are going to keep showing up.

They can meet the real you. - [Avi] Here. - Huh? - [Avi] Press that button. - This one? - I recorded an explanation, that should do the trick. I need to stay here and guard the ship. - So cool. Thank you, Avi. - Hey, get off me. Wait for me here, I'll be right back. (enchanting music) - Don't get lost. - Don't worry.

Wow! - Bram, I never knew you were so brave and fearless. - I'll never doubt you again, Bram. (Bram chuckles) - It's nothing. (Bramble chuckling) - [Tiki] He's a mean person! - Tiki, you've gotta calm down. - Don't you tell me to calm down. Briar, you are responsible for this. - Me? - Yes, you spoil him. You know you do. He doesn't have a responsible bone in his body. - Tiki? - Briar, I have to agree with Tiki. You're overprotecting Bramble. Listen, he's gonna need a firmer hand. - Oh yeah. He's clueless, clumsy, very dumb, and a little bit ugly. I can't think of anything I like about him. Briar, what do you think? - Huh? - I... (Briar sighs) You're right, I've sheltered him. He crossed the line this time, I apologize on his behalf. (melancholic music) (birds chirping) (pensive music) (suspenseful music) (Bramble crying) - Hmm? - Bramble? What are you doing in here? - I'm eating a snack, you wanna try? - No, thank you. That doesn't smell quite right. So good! - This bear's got good taste. - Oh yeah, Bram, I totally forgot to ask. How did your explanation go over with your friends? - Well, I think they're all still pretty mad at me. I know that I'm silly and clumsy and I cause trouble all the time, but I always do the best that I can. I wanna be more like Briar, but I feel like nobody likes me anymore now. (Bramble cries) (melancholic music) - Bramble, you... (Bramble grunts) - Much better. Ready for anything. (drone whirling) (Avi gasps) - Shucks, they found us! (dramatic music) (Mr. Cruz laughs) - Surprise, friends. I could have knocked, but a CEO always makes a grand entrance. Ha! Huh? They ran. - Avi, who was that big guy back there? - No idea. (Bramble groans) - What's wrong, Bramble? It's a vision, I see more metal cubes and a necklace. - Where? - In front of us. (Avi gasps) (dramatic music) Holy smokes! (jet engines roaring) We gotta run! - Hang on! This is our chance, let's get 'em! - What? Can't we just run instead? (dramatic music) (all screaming) - X marks the spot. These pieces were missing from my ship. Bramble, take a look. Huh? (dramatic music) I work all day and there's never any snack time. (dramatic music) I did it! Avi, the ship's being rebuilt. - Keep it up, I'll be back in a sec. - There he goes, running off again. (alarm beeping) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (Avi groans) (Mrs. Cruz laughing) - Kitty cat, you've been in our sights since you landed. We did try inviting you here, but you ran off. How rude, kitten. This time I prepared a gift for you, fireflies. It took ages to understand Rhyotan armor and even longer to build these. (Mrs. Cruz laughs) - Honey! You should have seen me, babe. It only took one punch, that cat was out. After the hard work do I get a little kissy kiss? Huh? (Mr. Cruz chuckles) Baby, I won't lie again. (Mr. Cruz whimpers) - Kitty cat, I know your secret in Antarctica. You must need this necklace to access it. I could give it back to you but there's something I want. This, a Quasar! (dramatic music) - How do you know about quasars? - Oh kitten. Darling, explain. - We're the biggest arms dealers around, weapons are our business. We studied your history and learned about the power you once had. (dramatic music) - The quasar cannot be controlled, you fools! - Oh my, that doesn't concern you kitty. (dramatic music) - Nobody hits my wife. I'm gonna teach you some manners. (dramatic music) (Mrs. Cruz chuckles) (dramatic music) (Avi groans) What's wrong? Had enough? - Will you help me? I won't ask you again. (object clanging) - Avi! Here I come! (dramatic music) - Uh, what is that thing? (dramatic music) (Mr. Cruz shudders) Honey? - Get them! - Avi, where do you wanna go now? - The south pole. - The where? (dramatic music) (Mr. Cruz chuckles) - Can't run now, kitty cat. Do as you are told, or else. Oh no, the necklace! (dramatic music) - Bramble, quick! - Okay. (dramatic music) - I'm going in. (dramatic music) - I think I see it. (dramatic music) (explosion blasting) (dramatic music) (Bramble breathing heavily) Oh, I got you now. (dramatic music) Avi, I got the necklace! - Bramble, on your right! (Bramble gasps) (dramatic music) - [Computer] Program activated. (upbeat music) (all gasp) - It can't be. Bramble has achieved core synchronism. - Oh, that's the cutest thing I've ever seen. - Even cuter than me? - No, honey baby, you know you're the cutest. I'll destroy it just for you, babe. Back in a second. (Mr. Cruz grunts) (dramatic music) - Darling! (Bramble grunts) (Bramble gasps) (bright upbeat music) Precious, my love, are you injured? Please say something. It's not your time, darling. - Honey, even with tears in your eyes, you're still beautiful. - Silly, everybody knows that. You clearly need to rest more. (Mrs. Cruz chuckles) - [Soldier] Ma'am, they're leaving! - Avi, did you see my moves back there? Just one punch and boom, he went flying. - Pay attention, you're flying the ship. - Avi, that transformation, can you do that? - It's not as difficult as you think it is. Plenty of us can do it. It is just I haven't done it before, but I could. I'll try doing it when I'm older. (alarm beeping) - Oh no, they're right behind us! (dramatic music) - Nobody hurts my darling, except me. (gunshots ringing) (alarm blaring) - Run! (dramatic music) They're gonna blow us into the next galaxy! - Bram, take us up! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Dance of rain, dance of pain, bring us money from the sky today! - We will give you two fish, just grant our wish. Money or gold from those sky, so our dinner we can buy. Grant our wish and we'll be good. Huh? Did you see that? (dramatic music) (missiles clanging) We did it! - Arnold, hold on! (explosion blasting) (enchanting music) - That's one giant leap for bear-kind! (Bramble laughing) (bright upbeat music) Avi! Join in, come on! (Bramble laughing) (Avi screaming) (bright upbeat music) Earth looks so blue from up here. It's beautiful. - It is breathtaking. I've always loved the view from up here. - Hey Avi. - Huh? - Can I ask, why did you come to earth? (calm music) - Well, I came here looking for my family. - What? Family? Are you guys here to invade the earth? - As if, you've watched too many movies! But actually I was born on earth. - What, on earth? - Hmm. My species, the Rhyotans, we used to live on planet earth millions of years ago. Us Rhyotans, were only a small tribe on earth, but over the centuries our civilization grew. One day we found an unusual substance in the Earth's core, Rhyotonium. It opened many doors. Our technology advanced rapidly, and in only a few hundred years, we achieved unimaginable things. (pensive music) - Then what happened? - We were blinded by everything we'd accomplished, the cost, it was coming. We were digging our own graves. (pensive music) (explosions blasting) Great wars were fought over Rhyotonium and the earth was wrecked while looking for more. (lava bubbling) (pensive music) We fled a world we had poisoned, in ships that were coffins. - But why are you back now? - We couldn't find a new planet. We spent years searching among the stars for a planet to call home, and then disaster struck our entire fleet. The black hole. (pensive music) - Avi, we will always be with you. - Our son. - Mama, mama! (Avi crying) Most of us didn't survive that day, only a handful of us escaped. I lost contact with the others. I had drifted alone for a very long time before ending up here. I was surprised because the black hole had flung us far into the future. When I returned, millions of years had passed. It was the same planet, but all the Rhyotans had disappeared (pensive music) - Avi, I don't really know what to tell you, but maybe just a hug will do. (calm music) - My parents could still be out there. Giving up hope isn't a choice. - Okay, I'll help you then. But where do we begin? - South. The south pole. (bright upbeat music) - What's that, you're canceling? Hear me out. My weapons are the best and cheapest that you'll find. (phone beeps) Moron, you wouldn't know a deal if it hit you on the head! Dimwitted buffoon! (Mr. Cruz sobs) Oh baby, we're going broke. Nobody wants our weapons right now. My love, our company's gonna be bankrupt extremely soon. - Hmm, if we had a quasar we wouldn't need buyers anymore. Imagine, everyone would fear us. (all grunting) - You're making me angry! You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. - No you wouldn't. He's stronger than he looks. - You're asking for it. - You're giving me a headache, cue ball! Enough! Oh ma'am, sorry ma'am! - Who's yelling at our guests? You were told to treat them nicely. - Him! - Him! - Who are you? And why'd you kidnap us? (Mrs. Cruz laughs) - We're sorry. We brought you here to help one of your friends. - Bram, you know where he is? (both laugh) - Bramble. He's been kidnapped! - He's been kidnapped! - By an alien! - Alien?

(dramatic music) (explosion blasting) (dramatic music) - It's them, why did they follow? Quasar! (jet engines roaring) - Charge! (soldiers yelling) Quasar, we're coming! - Boss, ma'am, enemy ship incoming. (dramatic music) - He just doesn't give up. - Green light on the cat. - Bram, watch out! - It's pilot time! (dramatic music) - Bramble, I'm coming for you. (dramatic music) - Did someone order a knuckle sandwich? (dramatic music) - Perfect timing. - Proceed with the plan. - Bramble, move! - Yeah. Avi, why did you say they can't control the Quasar? - Only the strong-willed can control one. Otherwise the quasar will invade your mind and awaken your darkest memories. From there, it'll turn into a heartless weapon. - Huh? (gunshots ringing) Briar! (dramatic music) Briar! - Bram, I need you! - Briar! Where did he go? - You better set Bramble free! (gunshots ringing) - Briar, it's me! (all gasp) Hey guys. - Bramble? (dramatic music) (Avi grunts) (Mr. Cruz laughs) - Go get him! (dramatic music) - Bramble was telling the truth? - We are not having a very good day today, are we? - Well, we were tricked. That song was convincing. - Avi, hang in there, we're coming. Briar, we need to hurry! - I'll see you there. - Bramble! (dramatic music) - Fire! (dramatic music) - Stop! Come any closer and the cat gets it. - Avi? (dramatic music) (Mr. Cruz laughs) - You fool, you're such a fool! You thought that you stood a chance, huh? You're no match for us. And you Bramble, such a dopey bear. That ship made you blind, you're not a hero. Lucky that you thought you were one, or else we never would've gotten here. - Silly bear. (all laughing) - Hey Bram, don't listen to them. (dramatic music) - Wait! Please don't start the Quasar. - Avi! - [Soldier] Stay put. - You won't be able to control it. Once it's loose, everyone here will lose their life. I've seen it, the quasar won't stop until everything's gone! (pensive music) Listen, it took so long for the earth to recover. There's life here once again. Breathe in the air, enjoy it. There's no other planet like this in the whole universe. This is the only home we have! - Avi? - Honey, that story sounds pretty convincing, doesn't it? So um... (Mrs. Cruz laughs) - Really? Trying to lecture us. You ruined the earth once already, right? And now you want us to listen to you. Rhyotans don't know what's good for the world anymore. With the Quasar, I would have unmatched power. Everyone would fear me, there'd be no consequences. And if I don't use it, someone surely will. Who cares if I'm evil? I've waited for this moment my whole life. I'll pave the future and crush anyone who's against me. Enough, let's do this! (suspenseful music) (Avi gasps) (suspenseful music) - Don't move! Drop 'em! Bramble quick! Use the core to shut down the quasar. Only the strong willed can control one, otherwise the quasar will invade your mind and awaken your darkest memories. From there, it'll turn into a heartless weapon. (dramatic music) Hurry! - Bramble, quick! (Bramble grunts) - Bramble! (Quasar whirling) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Watch out! Everyone run! (dramatic music) (soldiers whimpering) (dramatic music) - Honey, I need to tell you; Congratulations! - Cruz! Cruz! Cruz! Cruz! Cruz! (rocks clattering) (Bramble groans) - Briar, are you down here somewhere? Tiki? Babu? Vick? Avi? - Cruz! Cruz! Cruz! (earth rumbling) (Bramble whimpers) - Briar! Briar! (dramatic music) - She's lost control! (dramatic music) (soldiers yelling) - Briar! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Honey! (soldiers screaming) (Bramble whimpering) - Briar? (melancholic music) It's all my fault. All because of me! (Bramble crying) I'm too stupid, that's why. We fell for their lies. Briar, I just wanted to be like you but I messed it all up. I messed it all up. I'm completely useless. (Bramble cries) - Hey Bram. - Huh? - It's okay, none of us blame you. You tried to help us all, don't worry. This isn't your fault. Hey Bram, listen, you are the best of us; Your kindness and your heart, you always do what's right. We all wish we were more like you. - You're right, I've sheltered him. He crossed the line this time. I apologize on his behalf. But guys, he's kinder than any of us, how can we judge him? (pensive music) Bramble, don't try to be like me, just be who you are. I am so proud of who you have become. (flame roaring) (pensive music) - Bramble, hey Bramble! You must be hungry, come on. - Bramble, gimme a hug. - All right, you can have my bananas. - Bram, take the honeycomb and run! - Bramble! - Bramble! - Bramble! - Bramble. - Bramble. - Yeah? - Even though you're silly, cute and soft, you're my best friend Bram. I love you, man. (Avi chuckles) (dramatic music) (enchanting music) (enchanting music) (enchanting music) - Hero, please save my baby! (flame roars) - I can't let her break the lighthouse. - Avi, I'll handle that scrap metal. (Bramble grunting) (dramatic music) Pick on something your own size! (dramatic music) Big bear, boonie bash! (dramatic music) Yeah! (Bramble chuckles) - Bramble, you need to shut down the Quasar. - Okay. (flame roars) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Get away rom our friend! - All units, prepare for an attack. Let's save my wife! (soldiers yelling) (dramatic music) - Bramble you need to get up. We can only buy you some time. - Bramble, you need to wake up! (Avi grunts) - All right, that's enough! - Uh-oh. - Bramble. (rocks clattering) (dramatic music) (both stomping) (Bramble grunts) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (Quasar crashes) - You stay away from all my friends! - Why'd he stop? - Why'd he stop? (enchanting music) - Mommy! Mommy, please don't leave me by myself. Mommy! - [Kid 1] Haha, she's a dirty dumpster diver. (children laughing) - [Kid 2] She's looking through the trash. (pensive music) (Mrs Cruz gasps) - It's okay, don't cry. (calm music) (Mrs. Cruz crying) - I was so afraid and alone. - I'm here now, everything is going to be okay. (calm music) (bright music) - Hey! (Mr. Cruz laughing) (calm music) Take my hand, I can be your friend. (Mrs. Cruz giggles) - Honey! Honey! Honey, my honey boo-boo. - I feel like you brought me out of a nightmare. - Honey, I thought I'd lost you. Nothing else matters so long as you are here. - Bramble, are you hurt? - Uh-uh, I feel fine. Be back in a second. I gotta hurry. Time to take out the trash! True heroes don't look back at explosions. (Quasar explodes) (bright upbeat music) (soldiers cheering) - Victory! - Bramble! - Bramble! - Bramble! - Bramble! (all laughing) - You fought like a real hero. Where did you learn to punch? - Dude, you saved a planet. - I hope you're going to clean up all this mess. - Hey bro, you were amazing out there. (all laughing) - Bramble! Bramble! Bramble! Bramble! Bramble! Bramble! Bramble! Bramble! - Bramble listen, I had lots of time to think while drifting in space. Usually I thought about my mom and dad, I couldn't understand why they left me, why I couldn't have faced the black hole alongside them. But then I met you Bramble, and it made sense. My parents gave me a chance at life, they knew that there was still hope somewhere out there. I know that I might not ever see their faces again, but as long as you are here, everything will be okay because you're family. - Ready? Go! Come on, Bramble, you got this! - Soda can, blue bin Banana peel, yellow bin. Battery, hazardous, red bin! (all cheering) Recyclable, unrecyclable, hazardous - Nice work, Bramble. You deserve something nice. Go on, check it out. (Bramble cheering) - A treat, finally! Huh? (enchanting music) Avi, I miss you so much. - [Avi] Hey big guy, want some ice cream? - Avi! (calm music)
