(MultiCom jingle) (lightning crashes) (horses neighing) (groaning) - [Lord Raykin] Prince Alfred. - [Prince Alfred] Lord Raykin. (groaning) - What kind of worthless magic man are you? Do something! Anything! (wagons creaking) (electrical buzzing) Excellent. Now, they'll endure Lord Raykin's wrath. - [Voiceover] Whoa! (grunting) - [Voiceover] Lock the door this time. (screaming) - [Voiceover] Be quiet in there! - [Voiceover] Giddyup, giddyup, move along. - All my life I've waited to undo King William's reign. And now (grunting) on the even my impending victory, I am captured and incarcerated by none other than his son! (groaning) A mere child. (prisoners murmuring) If only I'd known you'd prove to be such a failure. You're pathetic, just like Perceval, who trained you. (scoffs) (rat squeaking) - Please, master, I've been stripped of my amulets. Without them, I'm an ordinary man, just like you. - Ordinary? - Please, I meant no disrespect. That came out the wrong way. - Of course it did. Everything you do comes out the wrong way. (thunder crashing) (keys jangling) - [Eurik] Release us. Release us. Release us. (groaning) Now, return Lord Raykin's sword and my magic stones. I'm sorry you ever doubted me, master. - Well, next time, you won't be given a second chance. Not so fast. I want you to cast one more spell before we leave. I want to make certain that King William and his precious son, Prince Alfred, both live to regret ever having crossed me. - As you wish, master. (electrical buzzing) - What, that's it? What good will that do me? - So long as your mark remains on this coat of arms, we can summon forth this castle at any moment for a period of one day, allowing you another chance to rule this kingdom. - When? When will this chance come? I need to ready an army. - With this spell, time is of no importance. All that matters is that you are ready, for the next chance you get will surely be your last. (laughs) (upbeat music) (men shouting) (dramatic music) (screaming) (loud crash) - Now, that's what I call refreshing. - [Voiceover] Silver Streak Cola, the choice of champions. Kids, don't miss out on your chance to enter Silver Streak Cola's Medieval Manor Adventure contest. Relive the Middle Ages in an authentic European castle. Become a part of the adventure as you fight off evil warlords, slay ferocious dragons. Who knows, you may even get the chance to rescue a fair maiden. - Who are you calling a fair maiden? - [Voiceover] Hurry on over to Medieval Mansion where the future will bring you the past. (trumpets blaring) - How cool is that? (hip-hop music) Oh, food! - There you are, I could use a hand here. - Yep. Don't worry, I got it, I got it. - Thank you, Peter. (whimsical music) (keys jangling) How was school today, Peter? - I don't know, it was okay, I guess. - And how did you do on your oral report? - Oh, I didn't even get to do it. Henry Banes got up and he took up, basically, the entire class. He had this whole bunch of maps and then he did this weird slide show. Even Miss Sweeney said he went overboard. - And when do you get to do yours? - Ahh, tomorrow. (disappointing music) - Do you know that that stuff is bad for your teeth? - Yeah, I know but I just wanted-- - I know, go upstairs and study. I'll let you know when dinner's ready. (hip-hop music) (horn honking) (kids shouting) - Hey. - Good afternoon, Peter. - Uh, you know what? I'm gonna be two seconds, I'm just gonna help Mr. Percy with this. - Well, that's mighty kind of you to help out. - No problem. What is it? - Well, let's take her up and I'll show you. - Okay. - Now, let's just lean it against that table there. - Okay, wait. Let's go. (groans) - Good, now where are my scissors? - Every time I come here you've got more stuff. - (chuckles) Quite a mess, isn't it? - Where do you get it all? - Well, ever since I closed my antique shop, I keep buying things. I guess I'm a compulsive buyer. Now that I have this, I may just be done collecting for good. Remarkable, isn't it? It's by a little known painter name Regu, was commissioned by Prince Alfred of Leeds in the 14th century after he and his knights successfully fended off a fierce attack, while his father, King William, was off on a campaign. You know, I believe young Alfred was about your age when the attack occurred. (regal music) Peter? Peter, you with me? - Yeah, I heard you. - King Arthur and the end of my long quest for Regu's masterpiece. - King Arthur. (chuckles) - Looks like your adventure is just beginning. - Come on, I can't take this, this is yours, this-- - [Mr. Percy] Nonsense, I gave it to you. Besides, I have my adventure sitting right there. - Really, you mean it, I can have this? Hey, mom! Mom, guess what? Mom! (plane engine roaring) (trumpets blaring) - They're here, shooting time. - Wake up, Phil. - You're Peter Grant, right? - Yeah. - Tell me, Peter, how did you find your winning bottle cap? - My friend gave it to me. - How generous of him. - Ben Lyons, a fellow native of my hometown. - You don't say? - Tell me, Ben, how did you find your winning bottle cap? - It's not Ben, it's Benjamin, I was named after Benjamin Franklin. - I see, so Benjamin, tell me how you got here. - By van. - Cut. - What gives? - This isn't working. - What's wrong, it sounded good to me. - This commercial is going to be the cornerstone of Silver Streak's new ad campaign and I'm not about to let these kids ruin it. - Hey, aren't you gonna interview me? - Let's see, you must be Tommy. Excuse me, Thomas Harper, II. - Any relation to the Thomas Harper? - I'm his son and by the way, I'd rather be called Tommy. - Fine by me. - So, what's it gonna be? Are you gonna interview us or not? - We're going to go inside first, we'll film you there. Wait, I want to show Peter and Benjamin in front of the dragon cave. Let's get this show on the road. - Not so fast. We're doing it. - Hey, be my guest. - You got a problem? - You both think you're better than us. - (scoffs) We don't think, we know. - What's going on? Hello? We're waiting. - She's waiting. - You'd better watch your back, both of you. - You know what? Let's go get something to drink. - Don't let him scare you. - Believe me, he doesn't scare me. - Good, because he's just a spoiled brat. Thank you. - [Peter] Thanks. - Well, do something. - Well, what? (screaming) (laughing) - His name is Zithrax, he's a dragon with a sense of humor. (trumpets blaring) (doors creaking) - Welcome to Medieval Mansion. I trust your journey here was a pleasant one and that you are all ready for the adventure of a lifetime. Follow me. This castle was first completed in the year 1370. It stood fast for many a battle until it was finally abandoned. After 600 years of decay, I had every stone, every piece of iron, and every piece of woodwork you see before you transported from the English countryside. Here, it was painstakingly stored and rebuilt from the ground up. - How's that possible? Castles like his took nearly 100 years to build. - Yes, yes, they did but, as you know, we now have machines that help us get things done a bit faster. - Isn't that cheating? - Rest assured, you're seeing now this castle just as King William and his noble family did the day they moved in. No corners have been cut. This is a faithful restoration save for some minor improvements like electricity and plumbing (chuckles). (gentle music) - Whoa. You mentioned something back there about the previous owner of the castle? Was that King William of Leeds? - Why, yes, you've heard of him? - Kind of, he had a son, Prince Alfred, right? - Indeed, he did. - Wow, Peter, you gotta see this. Here, take this. (whimsical music) (buttons beeping) Whoa! (laughing) - Here, hold this. (buttons beeping) Oh, cool. - I'm sorry, no cameras allowed inside. - But we had a deal. - And this wasn't a part of it. Now, if you will excuse me, we won't be long. Tell me, Peter, if you had the chance to relive the days of King William's reign, who would you want to be? - A knight. - A knight? Oh, why not aim higher, say a prince, hmm? After all, Prince Alfred was only 17 years old when he saved this very castle from near ruin. - Yeah, but Prince Alfred was born into a noble family. His whole life is spent being taken care of by other people. If it wasn't for his father being away on some campaign, he never would have had the chance to see battle. But a knight, a knight is way more exciting. - Then a knight you will be. As a member of King William's royal guard, The Knights of Horner, you will get your chance to see battle. Okay, so please, follow me. - Oh, wicked. - Hey, if he doesn't wanna be the prince, I'll take it. - Done. And as a knight, you will report to me. - Great, if he's the prince, you might as well make me the court jester because this is a joke. - Court jester it is. (snorting) Wait a second, I was just kidding. I didn't-- - [Girl] So, this King William dude, did he have a wife? - Of course, the beautiful Queen Sophia. - Good, then I'll be her. That way, I can rule over all of you. - I'm afraid her time in this castle was short lived. Poor soul died of the plague shortly after the birth of her son. - Oh. - Don't fret, there are plenty of fair maidens who were of noble standing. - So, they didn't have to take orders from the prince, right? - That is correct. - Hmm. - I've instructed my associate, Hugo, to begin downloading your pre-programmed adventure into our computer system. From here, it will be remotely fed to the rest of my staff. Bear in mind, things here at Medieval Mansion, are never quite what they seem (chuckles). Isn't that right, Hugo? (screaming) - [Both] Cool. - To adventure. - [All Teens] To adventure. - [Peter] Whoa, okay, can't see my food. (whispering) - If you will please excuse me, but I must attend to some pressing business. Please, eat up and enjoy yourselves. I will check in with you in the morning. - [Tommy] Whatever. - How long before it arrives? - Approximately three hours, sir. It's growing in size and it's already packing quite a punch. The odd thing, sir, is there was no sign of it on the Doppler radar until a few moments ago. I don't know where it came from. - Hmm, that doesn't sound right. There must be something wrong with the equipment. - No, the readings all match up. I rechecked them myself. Sir, I don't think there's much cause for alarm. All our power lines are underground and the storm should clear by morning. - Hmm, can you guarantee that? - Not entirely, sir, I'd feel more confident if our generators were online. - What? Why am I just hearing about this now? We have an adventure set to begin in the morning. What if there's a power outage? - Shall I cancel the adventure, sir? We can send our guests home. - No, the van left hours ago, there's no way it could get back here in time. Well, this castle's been through it's fair share of bad weather. It looks like we have no other choice but to try to ride this storm out. (strong wind blowing) (lightning crashing) (sign squeaking) (loud thud) - Run, open the gate. (doors creaking) - Can I help you? - (chuckles) Yes, I believe you can. (laughing) (birds chirping) - You're paying your bill? - Of course I paid it. There's gotta be a regular phone around here somewhere. - Ask Wiggins, I'm sure he'll get one for you. - You're right, have either of you seen him? It's funny, yesterday this place was crawling with staff members. There you are! Where's everyone else? - They're upstairs getting dressed. Is something wrong? - No, I need a shot of the four of you coming down those stairs together. You know, to capture the first day of your adventure and all. - Oh, do you want me to go back up and wait? - You know, Claudia, we could just do it later. No one will know the difference. - I will. - Was it something I said? - Don't sweat it, kid, she's a little high strung. - It's an understatement. - Come on, let's grab some breakfast. - Looks like we missed it. - [Tommy] Well, maybe you should cook. (bells jingling) - What are you doing? I need you all back up here right now. We're already way behind schedule. - I'm starving, can't we have breakfast first? - Yeah, let's eat. - Where's the food? - Yeah, what kind of place is this anyway? - They do serve food here, don't they? - Huh. That's weird. What if I? No. - This doesn't make any sense. We can't be the only ones awake in this entire castle. - No, sure we can. The rest are still in sleep mode. Look, last night's storm knocked out the power, the computers are down. That's why nobody's awake yet. - I'm confused, who are we talking about here? - The robots. Guys, come on, Wiggins is the only human in this place. The rest were all robots he created. - There's no way that old man could run this place by himself. - Are you kidding me? You've seen the kind of computer power he's got stashed away in that hidden room. - We have to find Wiggins. - Some adventure this is, I'm gonna give that old timer a piece of my mind. Mr. Wiggins! Oh, Mr. Wiggins, where are you? (knocking on door) Come out! (door creaking) - That can't be good. It's dead, no dial tone. You're right, the computers must all be down. His bed hasn't even been slept in. - The gate's open. Guys? Come on. (ominous music) - I know for a fact that Conrad designed this place to be outfitted with back up generators. - Yeah, well, why haven't they kicked in yet? - I don't know. (growling) - Uh-oh. - What was that. - A Zithrax. - [Benjamin] A dragon? - Guys, that thing can't fly, it's totally fake. (door rattling) - [Alison] We've gotta get out of here. - Don't worry, Alison, it's gonna be okay. This is my castle now, all I have to do is summon my army and slay that foul beast. - No, no! This is not part of the adventure, I think this is real. - [Tommy] Yeah, sure, and I'm really prince Alfred. - What are you trying to say, Peter? - Come on, that was no robot out there. You guys were there, that dragon was real. Okay, call me crazy-- - [Benjamin] You're crazy. - No, no, listen, I think we might actually be back in the Middle Ages. - Don't you get it? This is all part of the adventure, it's already begun. The old man's just messing with us. - You think? - I must say, I'm impressed. For a second, Wiggins really had me going there. - Guys, I really don't think we should take this so lightly. - I hate to say it, Peter, but I think they're right. - Okay. There's only one way to know for sure. - [Claudia] And how's that? - We have to figure out how to get inside that hidden room Wiggins showed us. Once the computers are back online, we'll know where we stand. - Relax, will you, just go with it. This is the adventure you came for. - Yeah, maybe. - Let him go, he'll be back in no time. (buttons beeping) - Come on, work. Must be broken. (rattling) Hello. - [Voiceover] System failure. All operations compromised. - Great, tell me something I don't already know. - [Voiceover] How am I supposed to do that? There is no way for me to ascertain what you already know. - Okay, you heard me? - [Voiceover] It would appear that way. - I gotta get me one of these. - [Voiceover] I'm sorry, I could not catch that. Could you please speak up a bit? - No, nothing, sorry. Okay, I was just wondering, can you get me into the hidden room? - [Voiceover] Which one? - There's more than one? - [Voiceover] Yes, a castle this old holds many secrets. I must admit there are some I do not even know. - All right, how 'bout the one where Wiggins keeps all the computers. Does the trap work without electricity? - [Voiceover] Ah, you must be speaking of the operations room, my personal favorite. The technology within those four walls is truly awe-inspiring. - Okay, on second thought, maybe I don't need one. - [Voiceover] What's that you just said? - Nothing! Operations room, can you get me in or not? - [Voiceover] Oh, the operations room, please forgive me. It's just been so long since Mr. Wiggins has utilized my voice chip. I feel so, what's the word? Alive, no, no, that's not it. I feel so-- - [Peter] Free? - [Voiceover] Yes, that's it, I feel so free. - Great, can we go now? - [Voiceover] Yes, of course. - Okay, I'm in front of the throne, now what? - [Voiceover] Do you see the knight standing to the right of the throne? - Yes. - [Voiceover] Lift it's faceplate. - Whoa, it's empty. Nothing happened. You sure it's not the other knight? - [Voiceover] No, I thought for sure it was the one on the right. Oh dear, I wonder if my memory was hurt during the fall. - Wait a minute. There's no electricity, there's gotta be generators, right? - [Voiceover] Yes. - Okay, quick, take me to them. - Where do you think you're going? - I want to see if I can get the generators started. - Give it a rest, you freak, you're gonna ruin everyone's adventure. - Look, Tommy, I really don't have time for this, please get out of my way. - Fight me for it. - Look, I'm not gonna fight you. - Coward! (swords clanging) - [Tommy] Had enough yet? - You don't scare me. - [Tommy] Too bad I don't believe you. - Some prince you are, attacking one of your own knights. - What are you doing? - A prince should never try and harm those who are loyal to him. That's hardly a noble thing to do. So fill me in on your plan. - Generators are this way. - Lead the way. - They're gonna pay for this. - I thought we were supposed to be fighting a bunch of robots, not each other. What are you doing? - Thanking you. - Just leave me alone. - Why, don't you like me? - As if. Stop it! - [Lord Raykin] You heard her, hands off. - Thanks. - Think nothing of it. Anything for a lovely young maiden. - Who are you? - I have come for Prince Alfred. I wish to have a word with him. - I am prince of this castle. (laughing) (bird cawing) (screams) (rat squeaking) - You're sure you know where you're going? - Right this way. - [Benjamin] This sure is a weird place to put generators. - Bingo. Hold this. Okay, here it goes. Nothing. - Hey, how 'bout this one? It just lit up when you did that. - Hmm, there's only one gas generator. The rest must require some other kind of power. - What's that? - Oh, this, this is just a thing. I mean, you ask it a question, it tells you the answer, eventually. - Oh, it must be psychic. - I'm serious. - Well, why don't you ask it where the light switch is? - Okay, Mr. Smartypants. Hello? Hello? Hello, are you there? Hello? Hello, are you there? Oh, dead batteries. - Ah, figures. - Okay. Looks like we're on our own. Let's do it. - A lot of good that did. - Maybe it's enough power to get us into the operations room. (loud crash) - Tommy? Alison? - Somebody's doing something. - Take this. - Hey! - [Benjamin] Peter! - Benjamin? - [Benjamin] Help me! - Where are you? Benjamin? - [Benjamin] Help! - Benjamin, where are you? Benjamin? - What are you vermin doing down here? This is my dungeon. - Sir, we're just guests. - Guests? - Guests, yes, upstairs in the castle. - Huh, knight of honor. It figures. I don't need you elitist scum down here checking up on me. - We're not, honest. - Good, then be gone with you. I have prisoners to attend to. - Okay, okay. - That is no robot. - That has to be a robot. - And shut the door! - That was weird. - Yeah, tell me about it. I'm guessing our friend there was awakened when we reactivated the generators. Okay, here we go. All right. Do you remember when Wiggins told us that the computer would transmit our adventure to all of his staff? - Yeah. - The power must have restored the signal. That means any robot within range is gonna respond to the commands and come back to life. - If that's the case, this place should be crawling with them. Where'd they all go? - I don't know. I do know that generator's working. If I can get it back online, maybe I can get the phones and the lights working again. - First thing I'm gonna do is call a taxi. (chuckles) (electronic beeping) Well, what do you make of that? - It's time and date. - November 11th, 1983? Somebody forgot to reset the calendar. - Yeah, hold on a sec. 1383? - Is that the year our adventure's supposed to take place in? - I'm not sure. No, there is no adventure. This is real. - What are you saying? - We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy. - Then you were right, the dragon was real. - Maybe it's just those stone walls inside that blocked the signal. Then again, maybe not. Are we all ready to go? - I see him. He's taking a nap. We've got company. - What are you talking about? What are you doing? Get up. I want you to film this. Looks like Wiggin's little adventure is heating up. - Quickly now, we don't want him to awaken. - You heard him, hurry. (dramatic music) (dragon breathing heavily) - Wow, are you seeing this? - Uh-oh. - Who goes there? - Are you talking to me? - Well, I see no other beautiful woman staring down at me. Yes, you. - My name's Claudia. Claudia Drake. I'm here on behalf of Silver Streak Cola and Conrad Wiggins. Have you seen him? - Ah, yes, an older fellow, about my height? - Yes, yes, that's him. Do you work for him? - Let's just say that he and I have similar interests. Mainly, this castle, but please, come down from there. - What about that thing? - Ah, not to worry, the beast shall be at rest for some time before he awakens. - We'll open the gate. (groaning) - If this information is accurate, we're bumming. It says here that on November 11th, 1383 this castle was in danger of an imminent attack by the evil warlord... Raykin. - Did you say evil? - Yeah. Raykin? Raykin, why do I know that name? Lord Raykin. Lord Raykin! Lord Raykin was hand picked by King William to lead his attacks against the Irish. After three successful campaigns he was supposed to be rewarded by becoming a baron, his own land, his own castle, the works. - Then what's the problem? Why does he want to attack us? - Everything changed after King William's wife, Queen Sophia, died. The king was devastated. He became withdrawn. This was about the same time that Raykin was supposed to get his reward. When William refused to see him, Raykin turned against him, vowing revenge. They've been sworn enemies ever since. (loud siren) - What's going on? - Take a look. (electronic whirring) - Please tell me that's not Raykin. - That's the same symbol on the crest. We've gotta get them out of there. - It's a pleasure to meet you. Sorry, I don't know your name. - It's Raykin. Lord Raykin. - Tell me, Lord Raykin, just where is Mr. Wiggins hiding himself? - Well, he's not far, it's about an hour's ride by horse. - By horse? - Well, this must be my lucky day. I'd come for the prince, little did I know that I would be meeting my future queen. (chuckles) - What are you doing? - Get them! - [Claudia] Let go of me! - Back off, slick! (horses neighing) Get up, come on, keep running, keep running! Come on, hurry! - Thank you! - Be forewarned, I'll be back for the lot of you. (dramatic music) (footsteps approaching) - There. Get in. You too, move it. (groaning) - What are you going to do to us? - You are my prisoners, you will remain down here for a very long time. Unless, of course, you would like me to put an end to your misery now. Very well, then. Now, if you'll all excuse us, I must tend to Madame Drake's accommodations. (evil chuckle) - Where are you taking me? - Somewhere safe. I'll have food and water brought up to you and some decent clothes. Those foul rags you are wearing do not befit a queen. - Let me out of here this instant. I'm not your queen and I never will be. - In good time, my sweet. Give it time, soon you will come to thank me. - Please, you can't do this. - Can't I? By morning, all King William's land will be ours to share. (evil laugh) - Pardon me, sir? - I told you not to come down here. - Yeah, I know, and I'm really sorry, I just really have to ask you something. - I don't know anything. - Your master is in danger. - My master in danger? - Yes, yes, he's Lord Raykin's prisoner. This is what I need to talk to you about. I need to know where all the other robots... I need to know where are the other people are. - I rarely venture out of my dungeon. - Think, please, you must know something. Okay, you mentioned something about having other prisoners to attend to. - I dozed off. When I awoke, I found only you and your friend, the jester. The prisoners were gone. - Maybe there's another way out, maybe they escaped. - That's impossible. There are only two ways out of here. The main gates and the passageway behind the hidden room. - Passageway? - No one has been here since the castle was rebuilt. This entire section was brought over in one piece. - This is no exit, it's a dead end. - [Voiceover] Help me. - What's that? Oh my... - Bless you. Bless you. - Who are you? (slurping soup) - This other man you speak of, the one with Raykin, I know him. He is Eruik, a powerful wizard. He was once a student of mine. I taught him everything he knows. - If that's the case, why is it that he's running around with that madman and Peter here found you rotting away in the dungeon? - Knock it off, Benjamin. - No, it's okay, Peter, it's a fair question. Believe me, I've had a lot of time to think this one through. - Raykin turned Eruik against you, didn't he? - Yes, yes, he did. Eruik was like a son to me. Cast a powerful spell on me. The spell of undoing. - He took your powers away? - Almost. - But you're okay now? - So let me get this straight, you're not a robot? Your real? - (coughs) Quite real. Eruik cast another spell. One that would give Raykin another chance to take over the castle. He did so by invoking a highly volatile spell which can turn back the hands of time. - So you can just undo it, right? - If only it were that easy. I suspect you've all seen that coat of arms on the gate? It bears the Raykin family crest. - That's the one with the two dragons, right? - That's right. As long as that coat of arms remains there, we still have a chance. Now, that the prince has been removed from the castle grounds, Raykin will return to extract the coat of arms. It must be done before dawn. If he does so, the spell will be complete. - Okay, so we have to rescue the others. If we can get Tommy, I mean, if we can get the prince back here, Eruik's spell's not gonna work, right? - Don't forget the coat of arms, both it and the prince go hand in hand. Provided, of course, you return the prince to the castle before daybreak. - Why, what happens then? - You will all be permanently trapped in the of our Lord, 1383. And Raykin shall rule the land. - Well, this adventure just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it? - Perceval, do you know where Raykin is now? - Yes. - Okay, we have to get to him tonight. - Did you see the size of the guys he had with him? - I'll go. I'm tired of running away and besides, this corset is killing me. - Okay, then it's settled, Alison and I go, you two guard the coat of arms. - It's never gonna work. - It's worth a try. - What about Zithrax at the gate? (grunting and groaning) - Wish us luck. - Good luck. - So you're sure Zithrax is still asleep? - I hope so. Okay, all clear. (loud footsteps) (screaming) (dramatic music) (Zithrax growling) - Run! - Hurry, Peter! - Faster! (Peter grunting) Come on! Perceval, duck, he can fly. - Don't worry, Zithrax never comes inside the castle walls. - Told you it wouldn't work. - Yeah, okay, you were right. This is not where we're gonna get by him, is it? - Dragons, such as he, is impervious to my spells. His power's too great. - Okay, we go to plan B. - Did I miss something? There is no plan B. - There is now. - We're gonna have to wait until Raykin gets back and he comes for the coat of arms. - Then what? - Then what? I don't know, I'm making this up as I go along. (ominous music) - [Lord Raykin] Sit. You look... Exquisite. - I owe it all to you. - Hmm. Ah, yes. Now that's more like it. - Must they stand there like that? - Would you rather us be alone? - Mmm. - All you have to do is ask. Anything for my queen. - [Claudia] What will become of the others? - [Lord Raykin] You want them set free? - [Claudia] Yes. - Well, I'm afraid I cannot do that. - [Claudia] Even if I stay? - Yes. Even if you stay. Release them or die. - (chuckles) Now, put that down. - Now! You will do as I say. Stay where you are. - Take her to the bell tower. Look at her. So beautiful. With a little discipline, she'll make an exquisite queen. - Only if the coat of arms will be retrieved before the sun rises. If not, King William's castle will be cast back to the future. - Very well then. (blows out air) - You're wasting your time. There's no such thing as magic. There's an explanation for everything. And there's an explanation for this too, I just haven't figured it out yet. But I will. - Hold this. - Why? - Humor me. Now close your hand over it. Repeat after me: wind, fire, earth, and stone. - Wind, fire, earth, and stone. - [Perceval] Bring forth your power on this hand. - Bring forth your power on this hand. (chuckles) (loud ringing) - Now open your fist. (chimes tinkling) - I saw David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear on TV once. It's just an illusion. - Perhaps I should try a more direct approach, yes? - [Both] Hmm. - You're not afraid of heights, are you? - No. - Good, this time you don't have to say a word. All I ask is that you remain perfectly calm. (chanting in foreign language) - Whoa, what the-- - Hey, this isn't funny. - Yes, it is. - Let me down. - A convincing illusion, yes? - Hey, how's the weather up there? - I think I'm gonna be sick. - It's difficult to accept the unimaginable, isn't it? - This doesn't make any sense, it's not possible. - But it is. - Benjamin, you're flying. - This is amazing. (laughing) (gentle piano music) Ah, don't stop, I was just getting the hang of it. - No need, I already proved my point. - Ah, come on, one more time? - Hey, I wanna try. - I'm afraid not. - But you let him do it. - You and Peter are already believers, powers such as these are not meant to entertain. They must be respected for what they are, incarnations of nature's awesome power. (knocking) - Can't forget these. - Arm. Release. - It's Raykin. - No. - Arm. Release. - Where is Zithrax? - I don't know, maybe they poisoned him again. - No, the dragon would never fall for the same trick twice. - I need that coat of arms. Release! (dragon growling) Cowards! (laughing) - What was that, did they kill him? - No, no, it takes much more than that to slay a dragon such as he. He'll be back angrier than ever. - Release! - When, we need him now! (loud thump) - Put the coat of arms on the wagon, hurry! (men murmuring) Yes, it's all mine now (evil laugh). Go! - [Voiceover] Open the gates! - No, come on, there's gotta be something we can do here! Anything? What about King William? Where's he? Can we contact him? - No, he's too far away to be of any help to us. - Okay, then it's up to us, we're the only hope. (gentle music) We can't let Raykin win. (chanting in foreign language) (bells tinkling) (loud ringing) (haunting music) - [Zithrax] Perceval, it's been a long time. - Indeed, it has. - You know I never bargain with mortals. - I have a proposition for you. Something that would benefit you, as it would I. - Hmm, I'm listening. (wolf howling) - How'd you convince him to join us? - Actually my plan failed. We owe it all to Peter. - What did you say? - I just told him if Raykin takes control of the castle, he plans to fill in the grotto. There's nothing worse than being left homeless. - We're here. Keep a look out for Raykin's centuries. - Right. (uplifting music) - We can take him. - Stay low. - [Voiceover] All right, men, let's go. Keep your eyes open. - [Voiceover] Look, over there. - [Voiceover] Yes, hang on. - Uh-oh, looks like we've been made. - No, that's not it, it's Eurik. He must have sensed my presence. They're just searching to appease him. - How do we get rid of them? (Zithrax growling) - I believe Zithrax has it covered. (Zithrax growling) - Go, go, go, go! - Hey, over here! (loud buzzing) I was beginning to think we would never be saved. - I know that feeling. - Here, hold this. - [Alison] Yeah. - So what's with the armor? - Peter was right, knights do have more fun. - Where's Claudia, have you found her? - No, not yet. - One thing's for sure, she'd kill us if we didn't get this all on film. - Okay, let's go. (ominous music) - What a pleasant surprise. It isn't often that I have guests. To what do I owe this honor? - You know exactly why we're here. It's over, Raykin. You're finished. We have the prince, we're taking the coat of arms with us. - (laughs) Such a confident young knight. What's your name? - Peter Grant. - Hmm, well you seem wise beyond your years, Peter. Perhaps you should quit while you're ahead. (chuckles) You haven't a chance against me. And nor does this old fool that you've aligned yourself with. - You're wrong. - Ah, yes? (evil chuckle) If I am wrong, the why are you surrounded? - Let him go! - I've got the prince once again. (evil laugh) - [Peter] Let him go! - Perceval, at long last we meet again. (loud crash) (men groaning) I see you have regained your powers. - Yes, and I have never felt stronger. - Too bad, they won't last long. - [Benjamin] No, Perceval! (Perceval groaning) (swords clanging) (dramatic music) (Alison grunting) - Peter! - Let him have it, Benji! - Concentrate! (Eurik laughing evilly) - Yeah! Hi! - Nice goin'. - Alison, help the others. Okay, I'm going up. - You're crazy. - Yes, yes, I am (evil laugh). - Leave them alone, Raykin, this is between you and me now. - Very well then. (swords clanging) (Peter grunting) (Raykin laughing) - You're finished! - Aren't you coming? - No, I can't leave Perceval here. - You can't hide behind that forever. - No, but you can. (swords clanging) - Prepare to meet your maker. Will you not even try to fight back? - There's no need, you've already lost. - No, no, no, please? - No, Raykin, let her go! Please, take me instead! - Not a chance. Every woman falls for me sooner or later. - Look what you've done. - Cast away your evil spells, undo the harm that you have caused. - Never! - This is your last chance. (chanting in foreign language) - It's broken. - Now, lay down your swords or she goes over. I swear it. Splendid, now, back away slowly. - Don't believe him. (screaming) - Lord heavens, no! - I was going to die. We were falling and then Zithrax, he snatched us both out of the sky. When he put us down, I fell on top of this loser. (Raykin groaning) (laughing) I'm alive and you got the whole thing on film, didn't you? - Yes. (laughing) (uplifting music) - This is not over! Do something, you worthless fool! - Pipe down, will you? You were the one that got us into this mess in the first place! - How dare you speak to me that way! I'll have your head for this! - Hey, I have an idea. Why don't you show these two fine gentlemen the hidden room that Perceval called home for several years. - It would be my pleasure. - No, no! - Enjoy your stay. Now then, there is still one important piece of business to attend to. (bells tinkling) - What about the crest? That's still Raykin's isn't it? - Benjamin, will you do the honors? - Really? - Words, do not forget the words. - Wind, fire, earth, and stone. Bring forth your powers on this hand. (loud ringing) (laughing) All right! (whimsical music) You're supposed to slap my hand. - Why are on earth would I do a thing like that? - Never mind. (dramatic music) - Okay. What do we do now? - I don't know. - So how will we know if we're still stuck in the Middle Ages? - I guess we'll just all have to wait and see what the new day brings. (crowds shouting outside) - Do you hear that? - What? (robots cheering) - Where did they all come from? - My robots, they all reside in an underground bunker just outside the castle gate. - That's why they didn't travel back in time with us. Hey! Hey, we made it, we're home! - We're home? - Perceval? Perceval? - Where'd he go? - Well, he was just here a second ago. - He's... - He's gone. - We could have never made it without him. - You're too modest. - I'm just gonna leave you two alone. (gentle piano music) - [Voiceover] The thrill of romance, action, and adventure. - This is amazing. - [Voiceover] Hurry on over to Medieval Mansion, where the future will bring you the past. - That was great. - To adventure. - [All] To adventure. - I can't believe we lived one town over our whole lives. If it wasn't for winning that contest, we might never have met. - Did you just see that? - See what? - What's up? - Are you okay? - I've never been better. (synthesizer music) (MultiCom jingle)
