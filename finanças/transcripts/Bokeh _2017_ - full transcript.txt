[dramatic music] ¶ ¶ [speaking foreign language] Welcome to Iceland. Thirty minutes, we'll be reaching... [dramatic music] ¶ ¶ [geyser exploding] [geyser exploding] You know that you used all your savings for this trip? [laughs] Yeah. I really wanna help out so... just... [laughing] Yeah, I just thought... -Nope, nope, no! -Yeah! -Oh, you didn't. -I did. It's in my mouth. It's in-- Yup, yup, yup, yup! [laughs] So you think we're gonna be able to find film? We don't need to. I brought a lot of film before I came out here. So we're okay. Why won't you just let me buy you that new camera? I don't want a computer autocorrecting everything. I wanna capture the moment. You are a stubborn son of a gun. My dad would talk about capturing the moment, okay? Now I was never very good at it. Um, I mean sometimes I kept a little piece of it. It feels good because you're capturing something where everything is great. There's nothing bad. I mean, if there's an imperfection, that's okay. That's not bad. [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ This church was built in the 18th century. But man came here long before it. Fleeing the tyranny of Harold the Fairhair. [stuttering] Harold the Fairhair of Normandy. Yeah, but later spread the word of god to the healers. What was life like back then? Well it was simple. And the stories were simple. There's that mischievous age of the warmhearted. And the adventures of Inqua, the far traveler. You heard about Inqua? -I have not. -No. Okay, okay. And this is where early parliament meetings were held. [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ [camera shutters] [camera shutters] [camera shutters] This is [inaudible name] or Long Rock. [indistinct chatter] I think I just defiled the [inaudible name]. You-you did. You defiled the [inaudible name]. No. Nothing I missed about churches. What was your dad's place like? It was plain. White walls, beige carpets. Felt more like an office building than... But this. [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ [eerie music] ¶ ¶ [eerie music] ¶ ¶ [scoffs] Baby, wake up. -Mmm. -Wake up! Wake up, come on. Let's go experience Iceland. It's getting late. I'm hungry. We can get some food. I'm still on US time. Well, there's only one way out of that. Get up. No. It's so bright in here. There's supposed to be continental breakfast. Wanna do cafι? Yup. [bell rings] Someone's asleep at the wheel. [eerie music] ¶ ¶ What time is it? 10:30, I think. Why? Well it's just... it's empty. Is it like a holiday or... I don't know. Maybe some event or something. Like the solstice. That's a celebration, right? The summer solstice. Okay. Hello! Hello? I mean, wouldn't we have heard some sort of an event. Like seen a billboard or something. Hello! We need to look inside. Okay, where? Anywhere. I-I-I... Hello? Hello? Hello? There's nobody. [suspenseful music] ¶ ¶ I called the restaurant from last night and there's no answer. Riley. Yeah? I called my mom. And? She didn't answer. [suspenseful music] ¶ ¶ What the hell is happening? We walked through half the city. Where did everybody go? It's like everybody went on a lunch break. City wide. Is there a, uh... a remote control. There's gotta be coverage on whatever the hell this is. I mean, the TV's still working. Hey, mom, um... it's been a super weird day here and I just would love to be able to talk to you. So if you can give me a call. The only channels that aren't working are the news shows. [mumbling] Riley, this is starting to freak me out. I know, I don't get it at all. If it were a plague, where are all the bodies? I mean, if it were aliens, where are the ships? I don't... There's no emails, no posts. No activity anywhere. Wait, what do you mean? [typing] Hey, Aims, um... Call me when you get this. I would love to hear your voice. No one's picking up. Everyone should be up by now. Nobody? No text messages, no emails, nothing? Nothing. The internet is still working. No, this is from yesterday. That hasn't been updated since yesterday. What is happening? Nobody's picking up their phones. Voicemail's still working. City's empty. I mean, if it was an internet problem, we wouldn't even be seeing this stuff, right? We need a vantage point. We need a world view. What is going on? No. No. No. No. We're here, baby. There's gotta be other people. There's gotta be somebody, somewhere. Let's go. What the fuck? Hey, hello? It's still in drive. [engine revving] Is something happening? What do you mean? Is this it? Is this the rapture? You mean like the apocalypse? The end of times. Try your mother again. [serene music] ¶ ¶ Hello! [phone ringing] Hi, you've reached Sharon's cellphone. I'm not available to take your call right now, but if you'd-- Voicemail. I wanna say that everybody just went to the east side of the island. And I wanna say that your mom just went shopping and she forgot her phone at home. Same as your dad and Amy and everybody else. I wanna say this is the second coming. I wanna say this is the longest nightmare that I have ever had. But I just... I don't know what happened. Atleast... Atleast we're here together. Can you please close the blinds? Where did you all go? I wanna go to sleep. I'm exhausted and the sun won't quit so can you please close the blinds? Yeah, baby. [door opens] Come on, baby. It's time to wake up. Not yet. You gotta eat something, I mean. Let's go make some breakfast. No. [door opens, closes] [typing] How are we gonna get home? How are we getting off this island? I don't know yet. I mean, do you think we were selected? That we should be preparing for something? No, baby, we're not selected, okay? This is not divine intervention. I don't know. I don't know if this is an epidemic. I don't know if it's some sort of Nordic relocation program. I don't know why we're here and everybody else isn't. But I do know that doesn't matter. What matters, what we should be asking ourselves is what do we do about it? Like what do we do now? I just wanna get home. I know. If there's even a... a home to get back to. [serene music] ¶ ¶ Baby, guess what? There's still room service and it's just for you. Gingerbread latte. Is it that bad? There's still too much ginger bread. Hm. I overdid it. -Thank you. -Mhm. Gotta do better than that. Ah! I'll be right back. This isn't all gonna fit in the fridge. I know, I've been thinking about that. Sit tight. It's time to upgrade, baby. Upgrade what? Everything. [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ Hello? We didn't even knock. Yeah, well we don't need to because this is our place now. That's nice. Just like that? Just like that. Why are the lights still on? The geothermal plants, they're all automated here so they'll just keep the country running for a little while. Until it breaks down. No. But yeah, until then, the world just keeps on turning. You done yet? Which color? Yes. [whimsical music] Why do I need these red gloves? [laughs] What do you think? Whoa! You're like a Mexican ninja. What are you doing? Oh, no. [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ Here, here. To many! [inaudible chatter] [gags] Don't puke! You're gonna puke! [laughing] [reading Icelandic literature] What is it saying? [reading Icelandic literature] What is this word language? Borg... I just burped. Borg... Corona's a thousand. Give me a thousand Coronas. I won a beauty content makes sense. You wanted to be the banker. That's 20,000. -Thank you. -Okay. Woo. What is that? Bullshit. This is mine. You're taking the whole... This is a death strip. And I'm supposed to be able to get through? You're gonna take all of this. Here, it's yours. I'm not... Man the Great. Stripopoly. It doesn't make sense! [laughing] [groans] This took only 35 minutes. That is a new world record for me. Ugh. Thank you. First, lattes. Then the world. Do you think this is a test? Test of what? Like the trials of Job. Like a test of faith? Um... I mean, you believe in god, right? Yes. And do you think that all of this, everything that has happened, was all a part of god's plan? Well, belief and faith aren't the same thing. I don't know what god's plan is. Well, that's kind of the point. What are we gonna do? Mm... Maybe everybody really did go to the other side of the island. Okay? Maybe the main communication pipe failed. Or maybe this will all pass. And in the meantime... Baby, this world is ours for the making. [serene music] ¶ ¶ [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ [grunts] [grunts] [camera shutters] Mmm. Naptime. You're ruining my naptime. Oh, am I? You go on and take your nap. [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ [camera shutters] [camera shutters] [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ [light winds] [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ Hey. [camera shutters] [camera shutters] Jenai, you gotta try this! Jenai, where are you? [serene music] ¶ ¶ Fuck. [serene music] ¶ ¶ No. Okay. Just because this place fell off the geothermal grid... doesn't mean we can't utilize the romantic comedy of this, you know? This is nice. Yeah, it is. The wine. Some cheese. Okay. We need to talk about this. Riley! [laughs] Why are you laughing? You need to be more careful, please. This was an accident. How am I supposed to stop an accident from happening? You could've broken a bone. Or worse, hit an artery. And you don't think we could've avoided that accident. We're not gonna stop living our lives just because you think something might happen. Excuse me. We're not gonna stop living our lives-- Okay, it is not about that. What if something were to happen to you? There is no 9-1-1. There is no one. You're freaking out right now. Can you just relax and enjoy this... I'm fine. It's just a scratch. We can't just childproof this whole city. We can't be jackasses either. [groans] Out here? Out here we're on our own. [door opens] [serene music] ¶ ¶ I should be in the shower. It's six o'clock back home. On Wednesdays I'm just getting back from the gym and I take a shower. No. I'm not gonna goof off anymore, okay? I'm gonna be more careful I promise. From now on. I should have brought it. We were only supposed to be gone five days. What'd you forget? My book. To Kill a Mockingbird. I just didn't think that I would need it. Well I'm sure that there's an English copy of it somewhere. No, I don't want a copy. I want my copy. It wasn't a journal, it was I guess more of a log. Everything important that happened or you know, little memories, I'd write everything in there. Why Kill a Mockingbird? My dad got it for me. This story about racism, lynching, rape. Great bedtime story for an eight-year-old. For whatever reason I-I hung onto it, I connected with it. You're in there. I'm in your book? The first time I said I love you. Well before I said it to you, I wrote it in there. [chuckles] [piano music] ¶ ¶ When I look around, I see a beautiful country, I see land, springs, houses, and then there's you and me. And we have everything we need. Everything else, we can build. Just you and I together. We can't build everything. [laughs] We don't need to. The hard work's been done for us. Just need to stock up a little, that's all. We have the world at our feet. I just wanna go home. I just want my book back. [serene music] ¶ ¶ Damnit. What are you eating? That's the blueberry one. The blueberry ones aren't ready yet. Well. Tastes ready. The strawberry ones expire first. Well I wanted a blueberry one. We agreed to eat them in order. It's like three days different, alright. That's not the point. What is the point? The point is, we are not going to have fruits and vegetables. And then the meat goes if the refrigeration is still even working. [sighs] Look. We can plant more vegetables. I can get more meat. No, that's-that's good. So what are you gonna do? Go be Johnny Hunter? Get a shotgun and shoot a cow in the head? And then what? Do you really think you're capable of that? Do you think I am? Just eat the food in order. [serene music] ¶ ¶ Nice uh, mark. Taking Ash Wednesday to the next level, huh? Can I ask you something? This whole thing, this disappearing act. Was this your guy? Because I can't figure it out. Maybe it was my guy. Maybe those chosen few are back home roasting marshmallows or whatever. Why does this happen when I'm here? Stuck in no man's land. Maybe our guys are the same guys. You ever think about that? Maybe that's why I'm stuck in no man's land. [piano music] ¶ ¶ [mud bubbling] [piano music] ¶ ¶ Do you wonder where we are? Yeah. [piano music] ¶ ¶ Do you hear that? What? It's the heartbeat of the world. I love it here. Can you see it? [piano music] ¶ ¶ They say that there were these two trolls who tried to stop the incoming ships in the new world. They grabbed and they pulled. But the ships were too strong, and the sun rose and turned the trolls to stone. And they left these petrified markers as a kind of gateway between the ancient ways and the new world. It's like they were waiting for us to bring in everything that was clean and good and fresh. I always liked that. We're out of water. I know. [serene music] ¶ ¶ [brakes squeak] It's from the 70s. What's it doing here? Um, just abandoned I guess. You see it the side. What, they just left it? I guess so. It's beautiful though, don't you think? I don't think we're looking at the same thing. What do you mean? Another forsaken object that's outlived its usefulness. It's just an airplane. Exactly, it's garbage. Don't try to tell me that it's beautiful. This is dead. Can't you see what this is? No, go ahead. Enlighten me. What is it? No one's coming back for us. No one. I thought you'd like this. This isn't some sort of game. God damnit, I know it's not a game. Well you can't just change the scenery and expect me to smile! What am I supposed to do? Open your eyes, Riley. [serene music] ¶ ¶ [piano music] ¶ ¶ [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ [piano music] ¶ ¶ [serene music] ¶ ¶ [phone ringing] [whimsical music] ¶ ¶ Shit! No, no, no! [frustrated grunts] [intercom announcement] [suspenseful music] ¶ ¶ Jenai? [suspenseful music] ¶ ¶ [sawing] [suspenseful music] ¶ ¶ [dramatic music] ¶ ¶ Hey. Just wanted to talk for a little a bit. I was being a jerk and I ran off the some show so I get to sit here and be angry. I guess you can't pick up. I know it's however many hours later there. Okay. I miss you. What are we... what are we doing? Nothing, go back to sleep. Hi. Just so were clear. Your boyfriend took me to Europe. My boyfriend is hungover. So keep having fun out there. For the both of us. Love you. Hey, I must have just missed you. Well I wanted to tell you that I just bought the tickets so Iceland is a go. And uh, I'll see you at dinner. I love you. [dramatic music] ¶ ¶ You keep taking pictures. You still don't have a place to develop them. I will. [camera shutters] [laughs] What? We're sitting on a glacier. This is the equalizer. Force of nature that wipes the earth clean. [laughs] What's so funny about that? Maybe god got impatient. I can't tell you what's happening tonight. I've been trying to figure it out and I don't... I'm not giving up on you. I'm not giving up on us. I know. Do you hear that? [water flowing] What? I don't know. Might be kinda fun to change up the place a bit. Wait, uh... babe, wait a second. Oh god. My god, there's nothing left. Exactly. There's no need to be here. Let's go, please. Just turn around. We'll find some flowers. This is what we needed. Just a change of scenery. I mean, the city's no place for us right now. We're pioneers here. We don't need all those complications. Man has been happy for thousands of years without all that stuff. Just come out here where the air is fresh and everything's simple. Simple. Of course that means no more gingerbread lattes. I'll survive. We got enough food for the weekend. It's gonna be a nice little uh, little getaway. [engine cuts off] Let's find a spot. Beautiful. There's a fireplace. Yeah. Wood stove. I'll go get some wood. I mean, you can't beat that. [exhales] Sir? Sir. Sir, are you okay? Are you okay? [speaking foreign language] Do you speak English? May I have some water? Yes, of course. Can you get him water, please? My name is Riley. My name is Nance. Do you have any food? Of course. We have plenty of food. How long have you been here? Oh, thank you. [exhales] How long have you been here? [groans] Oh, geez. Okay, okay, okay. You're alright, you're alright. Come on. Alright. Let's get some food. Here, come sit here. [laughs] We thought we were alone. So... There is no one else. You found no one. Just you. Are you alone here? When everyone disappeared, I left the city. I thought if the world is going to end, I will come here where shortly I'll join them. Were you in Iceland when it happened? [coughing] Is this your place? This is my cabin. But in previous life I was a fisherman. What have you been doing? I made my bed. Well you don't have to join your family just yet. I mean, we're here. [nervous laughs] We can stick together. We can survive. [coughing] Can we get him water? Here, here, here. Drink this. [exhales] I'm just so glad that I found you. I thought, I thought god abandoned us. They say that god only... [inaudible chatter] He just must have more to say these days. Well it's still good to know that we're not alone. We hadn't been alone. It's worse. You and I. Well Jesus Christ, I mean, that's not very helpful. Alright? There's three of us now. There is one and one and one. We each occupy our own distinct space. It's worse alone on the sea. I don't get why... it doesn't make any sense. Why are you so determined to give up? What brought you here? Uh, we were on vacation. My first time overseas. I've been here all my life. I spent time in the isles, years ago, but the sun has always set on the western shore for me. I miss my family. The Welsh have a word. Hera. Grief for a home you cannot return. And as a young man, I left my wife and my young son to make my living. I was on the seas for months. When I returned, nothing was the same. My son was a young lad and my wife was not the woman I had left. I sat in my own home and did not belong. She left you? She didn't need to. She was already absent. But soon I spent more and more time on the sea. There was nothing you could do? How is that fair? The world is the world. You cannot fault it for not behaving as you believe it should. So you don't believe that we've been led here to find each other? We do not factor in the will of god. His plan for us to exist in the world he has created for us not to exist in his world. What if that's true then? We really are on our own. There's another meaning of hera. Longing for a foregone home. Perhaps a home that never was. And none of it matters. Even if god exists, he's forsaken us. You, human, go forth. And in the end the question of our context is inconsequential. If there is a design we are foregone to fit within it. And if there is no design, we are alone in our keep and no ground will hold us. [crickets] It's time to wake up. Do you want me to make you guys some tea? He um... He didn't make it. There's a cemetery down by the lake. I already picked a spot for him. What are we doing? We're burying him with his family. Is this his family? Have they missed him? Will they welcome him now? Yeah, you're not making any sense. Talk to me. I don't know what you're talking about. What's the point of burying him? Laying here, six feet under. What's the difference? This is what we do. We bury the dead. None of this makes any sense. What doesn't make any sense? Why was he here? I don't know. There has to be someone else. Another... old man, or a woman, or a child that may need our help. It's been weeks. We haven't seen anybody. But have we really been looking? [sighs] Please help me. It can't just be us. [dramatic music] ¶ ¶ [knocking] Hello? [knocking] Hello? You've been busy. Here. Um... What uh... What are you doing? If there's someone out there, we need to find them. You're not looking for the living, you're marking the dead. Will you just come home? Baby, we can work on this together. There's no home here. You, me, nails. That's it. [scoffs] You don't know, we could be a statistical anomaly. Baby, we could be the world's last rounding error. Alright? You're looking for answers where there aren't any-- You're damn right I'm looking for answers! You have this insane situation and what, you think it's some celestial mistake? I'm not saying that it's a mistake. I'm just saying it doesn't really matter. Is this gonna change the way that you live your life? Does it have to? Is it gonna change who you are? None of this makes any sense. No, it doesn't make any sense. But it doesn't matter. We can still live a good life. [dramatic music] ¶ ¶ I don't even know what that is anymore. [typing] [waves crashing] [piano music] ¶ ¶ [water flowing] Keep your eyes on me, okay? Oop, oop, oop! Alright, don't look. Why? It's beautiful. Do you remember that glacier you took me to? Do you remember the water? This is that water. When the ice melts, it cuts through the base and it creates this river. The glacier slides a little further, it refreezes, it... it's just this constant cycle. Life is resetting, it's reinventing. Jenai, it's trying. Okay? I mean, this place is beautiful because of all that. There is no tomorrow here. There is no yesterday. There is just this moment right here-- Stop. I am trying. [piano music] ¶ ¶ [clears throat] This is the last of the water so we'll have to get some more tomorrow. I wanna thank you for today. Yeah. We're gonna be okay. [notification pings] [suspenseful music] ¶ ¶ [dramatic music] ¶ ¶ [sniffles] Morning. [machine powers on] [dramatic music] ¶ ¶ [brakes screeching] Jenai! [dramatic music] ¶ ¶ [water steaming] [groans] [coughs] [dramatic music] ¶ ¶ [piano music] ¶ ¶ [gasping] [coughing] [groans] [coughing] [groans] [panting] [groans] [grunts] [groans] [dramatic music] ¶ ¶ [wind gusting] [dramatic music] ¶ ¶
