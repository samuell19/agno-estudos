- You're sure about this? - Yes. Then I'm doing it. Not that. I'm doing it! I'm not! I am! Are you insane? Then I'm not signing. Hey! What? You think this is a joke? I don't. I'm really going to do it! Fine. Do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. GROOM JO HYEON-U BRIDE PARK SEON-YEONG Hi. Do you have to go this far? Whatever. Should I offer my condolences? No one died. What human in their right mind would do this shit? How embarrassing! Soon, the wedding... I mean, the ceremony will begin. Let's welcome today's hosts. Here come the bride and the groom! Where are they coming out from? Okay. Bride and groom... Well... Okay, well, they come down the aisle. Along with your congratulatory... I mean, along with your applause, here they come. My goodness. Next, they will read their divorce vows. DIVORCE VOWS - We're here today to end - We're here today to end - our three-year marriage - our three-year marriage - and go our separate ways. - and go our separate ways. - Our ties as a couple end here, - Our ties as a couple end here, - but as friends, we wish each other well. - but as friends, we wish each other well. Any questions? I'll take questions. What are you doing? If you're curious about us, just ask. Please don't say who cheated who stole, who hit whom, and spread false rumors like that. Stop it. You didn't even have a wedding, so why a divorce ceremony? Good question. Thank you. Our wedding had to be postponed. That's enough. Most of you here received our wedding invitations. But before the wedding, I had a miscarriage. We planned to have the wedding once I recovered. But once postponed, life got in the way. And so, here we are today. As you already received our wedding invitations, we thought... Stop kicking! Do you have something to say? No. We tried to make things work. But we started to disagree on everything and fought again and again. Of course we both made mistakes. I admit that. We held this divorce ceremony to officially break all ties for good! To conclude, let's take pictures together. How about a smile, please? Ready? One, two, three! THEY'RE CRAZY THIS IS FINALLY HAPPENING IN KOREA AS WELL SIX MONTHS LATER Take a look at these. - Camera 3, get ready. - Their functions are... Let's start with the bright, sexy red color. Do you see the stylish underwear design and the logo in the middle? It also adds volume! Isn't it gorgeous? We're expecting them to be sold out soon. Good Morning full coverage package. Make the call now! Cut! Great job. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Well done. - You did a great job. The product is great. Please keep wearing Good Morning. We'll sponsor you for life. Thank you. I'm back. - Hello, sir. - Hi. Sit down. Well done! How could a man change so much? Divorced singles are great! He saved our department! Why bring up my divorce? Listen up. Choose well and focus on what you've chosen! Drop the idea that you can succeed at both love and work. Give up on love or your family like Mr. Jo here. Choose between the two. Got it? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Please check your flight numbers... - Granny! - I missed you! Who's this? Jo Hyeon-u speaking. You cut in front of me! Don't yell at me! Who's calling, please? Who do you think? Come to Yeouido now! You cut in front on purpose! What? I did not! I went in when it was safe! Do you think you can blame me because I'm a woman? That makes no sense! - Shit. - Be logical! I'm sorry. Don't say you're sorry! He cut in front! Are you the owner of the car? Pardon? Yes, I am. I'm sorry. You're her husband? No, I'm not. - We just know each other. - Whatever. I have a dashcam. You can do whatever you want. My emergency service came already, but she's being unreasonable! We're both at fault! You're unreasonable! You're ridiculous! - Did you hear that? - She doesn't listen. - I'm sorry. - How frustrating! JO HYEON-U We will contact your insurance. Thank you. Why didn't you change it earlier? You're the only one I could think of. I haven't been here in so long. Do you want to come in for a minute? - No. - Fine then. Bye. This is my car. Change the ownership soon. Thanks for today. - Take care. - Bye. Are you hurt? No. I must be jet-lagged. It's okay. Just go. Can you walk? I'm sorry, but... What? Do you mind carrying... - Hey. - What? Not me. Can you carry my stuff? How long were you away? A month. You left the house like this? Then you left your car at the airport for a month? Don't worry. I got 50 percent off. You're so thrifty. They're all rotten! Stop nagging me. You're giving me a headache! I'll clean it. Okay, bye. You're leaving? Yes. I'm not staying in this mess. Okay, bye. Healthy husbands lead to healthy families. And healthy families lead to healthy companies! If the temperature of men's testis increases even one degree, it's harmful for men. What happens when we sit on chairs all day? The temperature shoots up! We could end up like seedless watermelons. Then what? How to lower your balls'... How can we lower the temperature of our testis? By separating the penis and scrotum with natural fiber material... NUTCASE ...that is sweat-absorbing, customers will feel comfortable. How are they separated? To me, it sounds like... I'm in a meeting. My arm feels weird. What? - Please fill out this form. - Sure. PHYSICAL THERAPY APPLICATION FOR TREATMENT NAME, ID NUMBER I can't believe I still remember her ID number. It hurts. It hurts. I told you to get checked yesterday. I didn't think I was hurt. Big or small, an accident is an accident. Do you want salt? What? Nothing. Keep eating. Eat up, so we can go quickly. Stop it! Chew with your mouth closed and don't make sounds. I told you a thousand times! Who cares? It's just one meal together. Just eat quickly. It's just a tiny sprain. Don't worry about me. I'm not worried. How long will it take to heal? About two weeks. Really? Too bad it's your right hand. Hire a caregiver. I can't ask a stranger to do stuff for me. But they're professionals. When Mom had her surgery, they did everything for her. I did it. I took care of her. What? I gave you money to hire a caregiver. Forget it. It's no big deal. Did you use that money for yourself? Why didn't you tell me? I was lucky to have Seon-yeong. Hiring a stranger would've been uncomfortable. Why? Are you two back together? No way! I just got curious. Don't yell, you idiot! - How are you so brazen about the divorce? - I'm busy! Bye! Three, two, one! Everyone! It's Monday evening! Let's go drinking as usual. Everyone can go, right? Sir, I have another appointment. You do? See you tomorrow. Mr. Jo, are you leaving? Mr. Jo! Mr. Jo... Put your bag down. - Get up! - Get that off me, will you? Eat quickly. Get better faster. Here. Not so fast! Please scrub a bit more. Gosh, are you crazy? Mr. Jo! Thank you, we're done now. Sit down. It was nice to get free underwear from me, right? I'll have to throw this away. Here it is! This is my favorite shirt. What are you doing? That's a rag! But this is... Damn it! That's my shirt! THE DAY SHE TAKES OFF HER CAST JO GUNG-HUI ORTHOPEDICS Let's take the cast off. Actually, Doctor... Can I wear it a bit longer? Pardon? I don't mind wearing the cast a little longer. - Isn't it uncomfortable? - Not at all! It's so comfortable. Mr. Jo? Don't you have to go early? I'm sorry I missed our drink nights, sir. Count me in. I couldn't wait for tonight. Are you sure? Aren't you terribly busy? You know I don't have a wife, sir. I have no kids, only stocks! You have my loyalty! It's always the best to drink together with people. If you skipped again tonight, I would have made mincemeat out of you. Look at me. You know my temper, right? Of course, sir. Go ahead, sir. I'll go after a bathroom break. Go on. See? You're skipping again. I'll be there, sir. - Go on. - You have to come. Ta-da! Why did you call me? What is it? It's nothing, sir. I'll be there soon, sir. Let's go. Ta-da! My cast is gone! Good. Let's go for some beer. I'll treat you. Didn't you see just now? I have to eat dinner with my team. But I have something to say. What more is there left to say? Don't drown yourself in alcohol. So? What do you have to say? What? I'll tell you in advance. I don't have money. I have way more money than you. Right. Then what is it? Well, I just wanted to thank you for taking care of me. Having you come over brought back old memories. Old memories? Actually, I thought of you, too. What did you think of? Living on my own made me realize things. Living alone is so comfortable. Sorry. Keep going. I think we fought because we were always together. Isn't it comfortable to live alone? I get the whole bed and can turn on the air conditioner all I want! I can sleep all day and no one says anything! And I don't have to use the floral shampoo. Do you still use that? Right! I hate that smell. Shoot. I should get going. Let's go. They're texting me like crazy. Does it make you that happy to be divorced? You're drunk. Let's go. I'm damn bored. What? You deplore? It's because you're drunk. I have to go. - Let's go in. - Our second round starts now! I'm screwed! I'm a regular here. Hey. Isn't that Mr. Jo? I think so. - Mr. Jo? - I'm not sure. - Mr. Jo? - It can't be him. Mr. Jo? You skipped the team dinner and came here instead? Why? Isn't that your wife? Hello, Ms. Park! Hello! My goodness! Don't call me his wife. I'm single and divorced now, remember? Please spread the word, so I can meet a nice man. You're drunk. What? I'm just saying hello. By the way, sir. Did your son get into college? Last year, I gave him a yeot to wish him luck. He failed thanks to your yeot. Oh, dear. Is that why you lost so much hair? Oh, no. I heard sons take after their dads' baldness. Well, that's not what I meant. Seeing you losing your hair, - I'm worried your son will go bald too. - Stop it! It's bad enough that he failed to get into college. Does he have to be bald as well? Imagine failing to get into college and being bald at the same time! That's so sad! - Failing and being bald... - I'm sorry. She's out of her mind. No, I'm not! I'm totally fine! You're Mr. Cha, right? Your face is absolutely beaming. How's married life? I heard you were getting married. We broke up. - Really? - They broke up? See? I told you they'd break up! Don't get married. Marriage is bad. Do you want to know why? It leads to divorce in the end. - Just stay single! - Gosh. Let me go. Are you crazy? We broke up! I know! Then act like we're divorced! Like how? Don't you know? I don't know. It's my first time getting divorced. Be careful not to cross paths. Even if we do, act like strangers! And wish each other unhappiness! Get it? Who says we have to? Is that the law? - I just... - What? You want us to stay friends? Do you think we're in a Hollywood movie? Forget that trash! If we could be friends, we wouldn't have gotten divorced! I helped you out of pity. Did you think I still have feelings for you? What? "Feelings"? Did you pity me? Be thankful I was nice to you for old times' sake. You totally embarrassed me with the divorce ceremony! But now you want to be friends? This is why you have no one around you! Do you know what people say to me? They say that I changed completely. You're the only one gone from my life, but I'm a new man! Do you get it now? So let's stay out of each other's lives. It won't do us any good to do otherwise. I don't believe this. It's because you're both single that the relationship is dragging on. It's so frustrating. Here. My wife's sister's friend. Meet her. I didn't see her face. You'll thank me. I have to see her face first. She was a Miss Korea contestant. You like Miss Koreas. Sure. Damn it! Your fingernails are white. Pardon? My nails? It could be from anemia. I'm not anemic. I'm sorry. I worry about health a lot. I see. My husband died. He was so healthy. Do you like to work out? Yes, I do. I run on the treadmill every day. He died of a heart attack. While running on a treadmill. He loved to exercise, but died so suddenly. Is she alive? Who? Your ex-wife. Yes, she is. Do you keep in touch? No! Not at all. I see. That's good. Just one more? #ALONE AT HAN RIVER #GLOOMY #YOLO #SCREW IT #FORGET THAT BULLSHIT Good dog, Areum. Let's go. She worries way too much about health. Who cares? She's pretty. That feels good. Is it broken? Oh, shit! No! The air is so fresh! Let's stay out of each other's lives. Stay. Good dog. What now? The emergency room? - Excuse me. - May I help you? - Where's Park Seon-yeong? - Let me check. Are you her guardian? What happened? She threw herself into the Han River. What? She was lucky. Someone jumped in and rescued her. She's stable and can go after the IV shot. Thank you. Wait. Please take good care of her and get counseling. Why are you doing this to me? I did everything you wanted! How can you do something like this? You nasty woman! Why! You're so selfish! How could you jump from there? Who's crying in here? He brought you to the emergency room. He said he rescued you, but that your guardian would come later. How's that? I think it'll hurt. It's hard because it's my first time. - That feels better. - Me too. Thank you. May I help you? May I see the director? Let me know if you need anything else. Thank you. Ms. Kim? Yes? Close the door, please. Sure. I was worried about you. I'm glad you're okay. Thank you for that night. There was a misunderstanding though. Still, I'm grateful. I'm not depressed or suicidal. So did you get drunk and fall in? No, that's not it. Anyway, I'm glad you're fine now. Wait. Here. What's this? How did you find this? I went back just in case. It was there. - I can see myself out. - I'll escort you. You don't have to. Have a nice day! Oh, my! You're adorable! Hi! So... Do you like dogs? Pardon? Romeo? As in Romeo and Juliet? He was abandoned like me. I'll take good care of him. Who abandoned whom? Do whatever you want. I'm sick of talking. No, wait. We need to talk. Why am I here and must we keep meeting like this? Until we find other people, why not help each other? I don't have any family like you. You have no sense of duty... Duty? Fine. I don't care if you become a dog trainer or whatever. Do whatever you want. I'm going. I met a man. A man? Yes. He saved me from drowning. You made me come here to tell me you met a man? What? Does he want compensation? He's not like you. No. He wants to have dinner. Great. You don't have anyone to eat with. It's your duty to treat him for saving you. I will. Don't worry. Here. It's my last gift. KILL YOUR TEMPER, ANGER IS A HABIT The name... Areum. Get down. Stay there. Romeo is a great name. I'll raise him well. Thank you. Now, I don't have kids or stocks. Damn it! What do we do with this jerk? It's been a month! GOOD MORNING UNDERWEAR SUCKS! FALSE ADVERTISING! He writes complaints every day! What do we do? He's raising my blood pressure! It's not because of our products that his thing won't get erected! Who can get their things erected by just wearing certain underwear, anyway? He says he'll protest outside our company for false advertising! - What now? - Sorry, sir. What if the CEO finds out? I'll go and talk to him, sir. You? You're a big, old softy. Are you thinking of buying him off with some free underpants? Do you think this persistent jerk will fall for that? Sit down. - What now? - Text me the address. Mr. Jo? Are you sure? Who else can go but me? They have no guts. I knew it! Send me the address. Go easy on him. Text the address! ANIMAL MEDICAL CENTER An animal medical center? Look at the smiling bastard. Welcome. Doctor? We have a guest. Welcome. Here. Hello. I'm from Good Morning. Good Morning? You've been sending us complaints for several months? Yes, that's right. Are you Sang-cheol, by any chance? Pardon? Sang-cheol, it's me Jo Hyeon-u! I knew it! Your family ran a dog meat stew restaurant, remember? - Dog meat stew? - Dog meat stew? Their stew was the best! Don't you remember? He brought dog meat for lunch and shared with me at school. I'm strong thanks to all the dog meat I ate back then! You know? Stop the nonsense and leave, please. It's me! Don't you remember? I'm his friend. Are you kicking me out? - Ms. Kim! - But now you're a veterinarian. Please leave! Please leave, sir. Sang-cheol! I'm Hyeon-u! Get lost! I'm glad you won't complain anymore. - But the false advertising... - Relax. I'll deal with it officially at the company. Don't worry. Drink. It's good to see you. We were pretty close back then. Really? I don't remember. How could you not? We got close after that day. How many years ago was it? JO HYEON-U Who's the punk who threw this at me? Come clean, now! - Was it you? - No. Shut the door. Cut it out, man. No one here did it. Just go. Get out of my way! Help me out, man. Stand up! Stop it! Sang-cheol! Stop! Get out of my face! You son of a bitch! Come out now! You bastard! Are you really a good fighter? Let's go to the rooftop. Are you fucking crazy? Let's go, asshole! Follow me, bastard. Why did I go to the rooftop back then? How's your mom? Does she still sell dog meat stew? She runs a pet cafe. She feels really repentant toward dogs. She can't live without them now. Your mother changed a lot! You son of a bitch. What the hell is that? What? Why complain about our underwear when you're like that? - What? - What the hell? I'm taking a piss here! - Stop it. - Get lost! Don't even ask. - No way. - It's true! Marriage is full of crazy surprises. I wouldn't know. You have to live together to know. She wanted a divorce ceremony to... Forget it. I'm fine, man! Being divorced has its perks. How about you? Me? - I'm single. - Are you divorced? No, I've never been married. At your age? Instead of writing complaints, meet someone. Okay, I will. Here. Take them. See you. No hard feelings, right? Stop writing complaints about our products. - Okay. - Let's go! I'll visit the medial center again. I'll provide you with plenty of underwear! What are all these? The Marketing Team is thrilled you stopped the problem from getting out of hand. He was just a loser typing on a keyboard. That was easy. But these fools would've returned wounded! They're only awake when it's time to go home. Pilates is for rehabilitation and correction. Breathe in slowly, then breathe out. Go down all the way. I'll push you. Breathe out as you go down. Go down more. Wider. Stretch it this way. You're so stiff! Straighten your knees. A bit more, please! AREUM ANIMAL MEDICAL CENTER Thank you for everything. Let's have dinner when you're free. Do you have stiff shoulders? My neck is a bit stiff from exercising. I'm fine. You should loosen it quickly. Do you want me to help? Pardon? Wait. Hold on. I'm fine. It's here, right? Take a muscle relaxant and soak in hot water. It's really stiff. I'll be quick. This will help. - What's with them? - No idea. Gently, please! Just a bit more. You fell in way over there. Please forget that night. How could I? I almost died. What? Yes, I'm pitiful! You son of a bitch! You were the one who hit on me first! Stay. My life is worse than a dog's. Screw it. It's okay. Stay. Here, Areum. Somebody help! - Call 911, please! - What's happening? Areum! Stay right here! - Can anyone swim? - Hey! - Somebody help! - Gosh, it's cold. - Wait! Hold on! - Someone go help her. Hold on! I'm coming! Keep calm! He jumped in. - She's drowning! - Stay still! Gosh, I might drown myself. Please help me! Let go of my head! Are you trying to kill me too? Goodness. Hold on. Gosh. Let go of me. Did you call 911? Did you? I'm about to die here. Actually, I can't swim either. Then why did you jump in? I thought of how hard it must've been for you to make such a choice. "If I don't do something, she'll die. I have to save her." Thinking that, I had to help. Look over there. Oh, I was going to open the door for you. Thank you. You must be tired. I'm fine. Goodnight, then. Bye. Seon-yeong? Wait a second. Here. What's this? It's nothing much. Please open it inside. No! I want to see it now. It's beautiful! Does it suit me? Well, it's a dog necklace. It's a gift for Romeo. Of course! I knew that. - I'm sorry. I'll get yours too. - It's okay. Take care. Doctor? Please call me Sang-cheol. Okay, Doctor... I mean, Sang-cheol. That's much better. But... Yes? I was married once. I thought I should tell you. I see. Mr. Cha? Give me the samples. Yes, sir. PHOTOS FROM SANG-CHEOL What the hell? The new underpants absorb sweat and separate the penis and scrotum. LOOKS GOOD, THANKS FOR THE REVIEW I WILL PASS IT ON TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM What? More pictures? SANG-CHEOL, ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT? What is it this time? You said the underpants were fine. What's wrong? Well... Forget it. Tell me. You said you wanted to see me. Don't write complaints and just tell me. Hyeon-u. What? I... I met a woman I like. I should've known. You had me scared. I saved her when she fell into the Han River. So? But she's a divorcee. I don't know what to think. You said that your ex-wife was a nutcase. I don't mean to discriminate, but I'm worried. What if I end up like you? It's okay to think that. You're experienced in this. I thought I should ask you. Are you asking a divorced man about a divorced woman? Well, it's not like that. You were the only one I could think of, that's all. Listen up. You marry for love, but find out you're totally different from each other. Then it's okay to call it quits. Just because you're divorced, it doesn't mean you're nuts. So? I'm saying a divorced person could be better. Since they failed once, they'll be more careful. Then does she mean that she wants me to call and tell her if I'm okay with it? Right! She's not hiding it from you. She thinks that you'll be able to understand her. She's wise, right? Right. She's totally wise and smart! Very sensible. Let's see her picture. What? Come on. Show me. Here. So? What do you think? Hyeon-u! No! Call 911, please! Hurry! Shit. Are you okay? - Hello, is this 911? - He's okay now. Stay back! I met a man. He saved me from drowning. I saved her when she fell into the Han River. How can this happen? It makes no sense. Why the sauna? - Just wash up, man! - Stop it! Don't you like places like this? I like hot tubs, but not here. Really? It's refreshing! Do you like her? Who? Seon-yeong. Oh, Seon-yeong. How do you know her name? Did I tell you? Yes. When you showed her picture... How else would I know? I guess I did tell you. It's not love yet, is it? Why are you curious? Of course I am! Why? Why would you meet a girl like her? That's why. Didn't you say a divorced woman is better? That's different from case to case. If a woman is divorced, some men think she'll be easy. Do you think I'm like that? No way. So... You're serious about her? Yes. Then that's good. It was a test. You passed. What test? You're ridiculous. I guess you'd know. You have the experience. Gosh. EVERYTHING'S CHANGED NOW Good decision. It's better to meet another man. Listen. I really like Seon-yeong. Why is the world spinning? After all the heartaches from her ex-husband... I'll make her happy from now on. Shit. Hyeon-u! Are you okay? Wake up, man! Call 911, please! Hyeon-u! KILL YOUR TEMPER Are we still on for tonight? Of course! See you later. I don't believe this! Wasn't it a bit boring? No, it was great. I can't believe I watched a movie with someone who took part in making it! It's just translating. You're embarrassing me. What other films did you translate? I'll watch all of them. You don't have to. Let's watch them together. Really? What is he called? - A beluga. - Beluga. It feels like I'm in the water! This is amazing! Seon-yeong, try it! It's okay. Is that why you majored in English literature? English was one of my stronger subjects. I had a crush on a guy in another department who... Let's talk about something else. Sure. I guess you can tell it didn't work out. Then that guy was... Yes. He loved Hollywood films, so I used to make subtitles for him. Is that how you started translating? You could say that. I found out as we lived together it wasn't just English that he didn't understand. He couldn't understand what I said either. Anyway, it led me to have this job, so that's good. I agree. It worked out nicely. What? The whole thing led to us meeting like this. - I'm not drunk at all. - Thank you. Pull yourself together. It's not that way. - You're drunk! Pull yourself together! - No, I'm not drunk! Three points! Jo Hyeon-u makes the goal! He scored a goal! NUTCASE MYEONG-TAE What? Don't forget to come on Sunday. I invited Seon-yeong too, but you should come. I'm your best friend who led your divorce ceremony. Idiot. I'll be there. I'm hanging up. Gosh, you didn't have to. Thank you for coming. So many people. Did he invite everyone to get gifts? Gosh. Sang-cheol? Hi, Seon-yeong! Do you know someone here? I went to school with the child's father. How about you? I'm friends with the child's mother. Really? What a coincidence. This must be fate. Welcome! What is it? Hey! Watch it! Why did you call Sang-cheol? Sang-cheol? Oh, him! Right! The dog meat guy! He must've been included in our school friends' chat room. He didn't even come to my wedding. Did he come today? Why? Have you kept in touch with him? Shit. I bumped into him because of underwear. Watch your language around my kid, asshole. Anyway, I'm leaving early. That sorry bastard. Who's that? Who? You found a man? I'm working on it. I knew you'd listen to me. Hyeon-u's here. Does he know? Jo Hyeon-u? He will now. Then go public and date him seriously. The baby's so cute. Are you okay? Sir. Hyeon-u! Shit. Seon-yeong? Meet Jo Hyeon-u, my high school friend. And this is... my girlfriend, Park Seon-yeong. Nice to meet you. I'm Park Seon-yeong. Nice to meet you. Have a seat and eat with us. Your friend complicated things. Yours, too. You're a great actor, pretending to have met me for the first time. I'm embarrassed to say you're my ex-husband, that's why. You don't know what a rotten bastard he was back in school. Why meet a stupid jerk like him? He's better than you! There you are. Seon-yeong? I found some lobster over there. I love lobster! Really? Let's go. Hi. Congratulations, Myeong-tae. I said I'll come. Let me introduce... I'm Park Seon-yeong. Sang-cheol's girlfriend. Oh, you're Sang-cheol's girlfriend? Yes. Nice to meet you. - This is... - I'm Yeon Hong-lan. My friend Seon-yeong is a true diamond in the rough. - My uncle's here. - Where? Let's go. Seon-yeong? Do you like children? Pardon? How many do you hope to have? What? - I think... - Excuse me. Do you know that could be a very rude question? Pardon? We haven't met long enough to ask such personal questions. What if I said I don't want to have kids? Or what if I want to have kids, but can't? If I say how many I want, do you think I can just have them easily? - I'm sorry, Seon-yeong. - Stop the car. - I'm sorry. - Stop, please. "Nice to meet you"? I don't know why you're so angry. Stop it! That's annoying! Eat with your mouth closed! Don't take it out on me. Sorry. Sang-cheol's not bad. He got good grades in school. Is that why you got beaten up by him all the time? I'm leaving! Fine. Sit down. It's for the best. Seon-yeong should meet a nice guy. She was too good for you. Everyone thought that. Says who? Me, my mom, my friend, my wife, and my sister. Do you want more? Sang-cheol is in her league. He earns a lot of money and is well-mannered. Hey. Just forget her. You know Sang-cheol is a good guy. You should meet someone nice, too. He went overboard. That's like going straight to inserting without any caresses. You know? He can't talk about kids yet. Maybe it was just a comment after your baby's party. You're taking his side? No, I'm not. Then keep dating. It was my mistake. No, I was oversensitive. I'm sorry. Why would you apologize? I'm sorry. I'm sort of sensitive about topics like that. And it scares me. I won't ask you to understand. Is there anything else? What? Is there anything else that I should know about? Like whether you ever killed someone or gambled a lot? No, nothing like that. No problem, then! I'm a cool person, you know? May I ask you something? Sure. Anything. I'm clean and... When we went to the birthday party of your friend's kid, we met your friend from high school, right? You mean Hyeon-u? Yes, him. It seems that he, well... He seems very different from you. Right. You're not close, are you? We weren't really close in high school. We met by chance recently. Anyway, he's been a big help in our relationship. How? He's kind of like my love coach. I see. - Welcome. - Hi. Are you with someone? Yes. There she comes. We meet again. She said she's okay with meeting together. We'll meet like this often anyway. I heard a lot about you from Sang-cheol. He said you're like his love coach. "Love coach"? Me? Drink up, Hyeon-u. I'm so happy! I saved the lives of both of you. He said he was curious, so I once showed him your picture. - Stop it. - What? He saw it and suddenly choked. So I did this to save him in the emergency situation. You know the Heimlich maneuver, right? Then the food that was stuck popped out of his mouth. You're so funny. If you know anyone nice, will you introduce her to him? He's divorced, too. Come to think of it, you two are both divorced! I heard his ex-wife was nuts. She went crazy and said she wouldn't divorce him unless he agreed to have a divorce ceremony, right? Did I tell you that? Are you drunk? You said she's a nutcase. You ended up having the ceremony after all. Gosh. How about you? What was your ex-husband like? He was like a dog. "A dog"? He ate whatever I fed him and listened well. Like a big dog who only cares about his master. The dog was my only family and friend. Owners may abandon dogs, but dogs don't usually abandon their owners, right? So it caught me off guard. I didn't think the dog would leave me. I finally realized after I was left alone... that I was like a dog myself, and trusted him too much. That worthless son of a bitch. He's completely drunk. Wake up, man! Ms. Kim, send him away. "Nutcase"? I should go. Sit down. Ms. Kim, sit down. Why didn't you tell him? Things are going well for you two. I didn't want to ruin it for you. Seon-yeong. I want you to be happy. I mean it. Meeting Sang-cheol again... I realized he's better than me. And he likes you a lot. He likes you sincerely. Son of a bitch. Ms. Kim, I'm cold. FUNERAL HOME Let's live together. I'll stay by your side forever. Let's get married. Ma'am. I'll take good care of her. Please don't worry. Who proposes at a funeral? We're planning to set up an overseas branch next year. It's not easy to launch in a foreign market. It's way bigger there, you know? Yes, sir. I've done some research. WORKING ABROAD There are differences in consumption and market sizes from here. We need to talk. Come over after work. Are you insane? Sell this house and go where? I have no money. Then just keep living here. I want to end things for good. Living in this house without you doesn't feel right. It's like I took it from you. It's uncomfortable for me to have it to myself. Seon-yeong. I should've sold it long ago. I'll give you half of the money. We're both responsible for the divorce. Who asked you for money? Let's not see each other anymore. I'll stop bothering you. Don't sell this house. I'll disappear, so just live here. Is she not home? What? Why... Why is he coming from there? Why were you in her house? Tell me. What's between you two? Say it, you bastard! Tell me now! I'm... Seon-yeong's ex-husband. Have you two... been lying to me all this time? No! It was over long ago! We just met to take care of some leftover matters. What's left to take care of when it's already over? This way, please. It's the master bedroom. It's amazing! It's okay. Come here. We'll miss you. - Please come back. - Of course. - Take care, sir. - Stay healthy. Keep this safe. Well done, Ms. Park. I'm sorry it's late. It took a lot longer than I thought. It's okay. I wish I could love like those people in the movie. But you have a great relationship with your husband. You never know. What if I'm destined to love passionately like that with someone? - That's only in the movies. - Do you think so? It's beautiful out here. I like it. What do you think? - I like it, too. - Great. What is it? Did you hear? Hear what? You didn't know? Seon-yeong's planning a wedding. Hello? Hello? Are you shocked? Sang-cheol didn't call me, but I heard it from my wife. You called to tell me that? Why didn't you come and help me pack? You're packing? When are you coming back? Not sure. If I like it there, maybe I'll stay. Are you so heartbroken that you're running away overseas like this? I won't go to the wedding out of my loyalty to you. What a loyal friend. Thanks, pal. Anyway, take good care. I'll visit you sometime. Call me when you leave. Okay. Guess the bastard couldn't wait. Whether she's getting married or not, I'm leaving. "WHEN HE MET HER" "WHEN IT SNOWS IN FRONT OF HONGDAE" IT WAS SO HOT IN SEVILLA This is Barcelona. It's not far from Sitges Film Festival. The entire city is so beautiful! I wish you could've come with me. When's the last time we went on a trip together? Ta-da! It's Gaudi Cathedral. Should we have our wedding here? No, let's come here for our honeymoon. From here on, I hope this book will have pictures of us together. Don't be sad I went by myself. I just came to check the place out so that I can come back with you later. Let's come here together when we have the time. MARRIAGE REGISTRATION Are you happy? We're getting married! It's all done. MANAGER I got a huge promotion! You're sure about this? DIVORCE AGREEMENT Fine. Do it. You're the only one I could think of. Having you come over brought back old memories. This is why you have no one around you! I helped you out of pity. Did you think I still have feelings for you? You're a jerk. You know that? Everything's the same, except you being gone. I hate that. It's like we're the only ones who've changed. It's so painful and difficult to live in this house alone. It probably started already. Why do you ask? Doctor, you look awesome! Seon-yeong! Stop! Sang-cheol! I'm sorry! You can call me a bastard and beat me up! But I can't let Seon-yeong go. Seon-yeong! Please! It's all my fault! If I don't say that now, I'll regret it for life. I can't let you go like this. I finally realized that! I'm an idiot for realizing that now! I thought... I'd be happy living without you. But that wasn't the case. Seon-yeong, please don't go. What's wrong with him? Seon-yeong... I'm sorry. Please, will you give me a chance? I'll be good to you. Let's get married. Apologize. What? Apologize to them now! My gosh. Why are there so many dogs? How can you ruin Romeo's wedding like this? WELCOME TO ROMEO AND AREUM'S WEDDING! Myeong-tae, that son of a bitch! Where does a fart come from? - It comes from the buttocks. - Let's clean up. It's messy again? Then let's clean it up. Seon-yeong's planning a wedding. Can you believe it? Already? People do that these days. It's unbelievable. You didn't know? Seon-yeong's planning a wedding. A dogs' wedding? Let's continue with Romeo and Areum's wedding! Next, the owners will bow to each other. Bow, please. Romeo and Areum will now march! Hyeon-u. Maybe we've come too far to ever go back. Seon-yeong. Like you said, I only thought of myself. No, I was wrong. I knew how you felt, but pretended not to. I only thought of running away. But I've changed, Seon-yeong. The divorce ceremony... should've been our wedding. I don't want to fail twice. I want to be a better person on my own Even if we meet again, I want to be a better person on my own. I want to meet you then. Instead of living together out of loneliness, when I'm fine to live on my own. That's when we should meet again. You look beautiful today. Let's go, sir. You'll catch a cold. Okay. 1 YEAR LATER Left leg over your head. Don't go down all the way. Come back up. A MARRIAGE BREAK Your English improved a lot. Do you have time now? You're the only one I could think of.
