(intense electronic music) (siren wailing) (helicopter blades whirring) (rustling) - [Woman] This can be disastrous for our plan. Head office is coming any minute. Let me see her. - [Man] This the best programmer we have. She's doing a scan right now. I don't know. This has never happened before, so we're just-- - Is this it? If this isn't sorted out by the time my phone rings, we are pulling our investments. - Scan's done. No anomalies in the aid code. It wasn't a program misfire. - See? Now can I please see Addy? - Hang in there CC. This is just so... Our nanny's aren't violent. It couldn't have been her fault. - You mean your fault? - I was protecting Addy! - These things record footage, yeah? - Yeah. (computer beeping) - Earlier, I need to see the lead up. Stop! Start there. ♪ Darkness cannot get here fast enough ♪ ♪ La luna ♪ ♪ My moon-a ♪ ♪ Come down come down ♪ ♪ My moon ♪ (emotional electronic music) - I love you, CC. - I love you too, my little one. Night night. (thumping) (electronic whirring) (door opening and closing) (foot steps) (glasses clinking) (sighs) - Lena, please keep the noise down. - [Lena] Shit! - Addy's sleeping. - Sorry, I... She's asleep already? I wanted to give her a kiss goodnight. - Her bedtime's 7:30. - Well, it's just passed. I'll pop in quick. - Lena... Addy needs her sleep. And you've been drinking. It's best if you don't go in. - I've had a rough... Okay, just show me the highlights then, please. - Of course. (electronic chirping) (soft electronic music) - [CC] Good morning. (laughing) You can't sleep. - Are you okay? What happened today? - I got fired. Replaced by an aid. - Oh. I'm sorry, Lena. I know how hard you were working. - Fuck them. I was keeping up. - [CC] Your favorite, isn't it? - [Addy] Thank you. (speaking foreign language) - [CC] Good. (laughing) Who's that in the picture? - [Addy] Me and you. - [CC] That's me and you? Wow! Good job! - There's nothing more you could have done. Aide workers are better suited to some jobs, and when they are... it's just best to let them take over. ♪ My moon-a ♪ ♪ Come down come down my moon ♪ - I love you, CC. - [CC] I love you too, my little one. Night night. (emotional electronic music) (chopping) - Is that Adelaide's snack for tomorrow? I'll do that. - No need. I know how she likes them. - It's carrots, I can do it. - I'm quicker too. You get some sleep. You need your rest. - It's fine, just let me do it. They're already done. - You bought Prosper juice? That's way too expensive. - Prosper's the best. Addy deserves the best. - Well she'll survive on something cheaper. - Lena, is this about you losing your job? There's no need to sacrifice Addy's wellbeing. - I am not! Just no more Prosper juice. Okay? - Lena, please put down the knife. You're not in a stable frame-- - I'm fine! (uneasy electronic music) - [CC] Yes, why? - What? Well I have more free time, so I can look after Adelaide myself. - No. You can't. - Excuse me? - Addy needs me. - I may not be the best mom, but I'm okay. She'll be fine without you. - Are you sure? Do you know what she's most afraid of? - The dark. - Jellyfish. But it's not the sting she's most afraid of. It's the slime. I remember everything she's every said. I have knowledge that would take you lifetimes to learn. I can identify a sickness and stop it in its tracks. If she runs out in front of a car, are you quick enough to get to her in time? Strong enough to keep it from crushing her? Okay is not good enough. Not when Addy can have the best. I know how to keep Addy happy, healthy, and safe. You don't even know the best juice to buy. - I'm her mom. She's my child! And I know what's best for my child. - Where are you going? - To kiss my daughter goodnight. - I can't let you do that. (thumps) Lena. Lena, please try to calm down. (groaning) (shouts) - Call Clover Hill Nanny Agency! - I can't let you do this to Addy. - This is Lena Howard. I would like to shut down my aid. Yes, I'm sure. Her registration number? It's um... AID... (grunts) AIDCC280-- (gasps) - Addy will be better off with me. (breathing heavily) - [Addy] CC? - Addy, honey. We have to go now. (somber electronic music) (phone ringing) - What did I just see? - She's programmed to make the best choice for the child. She thought she was the best choice. - We all know that the best can be programmed and reprogrammed. A shortsighted mistake in programming doesn't have to cost us. Does it? You can fix this, right? - Yeah. - No, it... It wasn't a mistake! - The mother? Well, if she survives, we can offer her compensation to keep her quiet. And we can always turn this thing on her if we have to. - You found what you needed! I get to see Addy now! Please! You promised! Let me see Addy. - Oliver. Showing emotion is just a tool for her. She'll be fine. (clicks) (gentle piano music) - Where's CC? - Hey, Adelaide! Don't worry, I'm gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay.
