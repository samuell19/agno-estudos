Hey! It's from the film school. What? I got in. I got in! See? When you're motivated... - Way to go, Mom! - Almost done. - What an idiot! - Sorry Yannick, I dropped them. They're just old tapes. Can't even carry a small box. Let her do it. Just carry up the boxes. I'm proud of you. I hate it when you're like this. She's been drinking. Forget it, Yan. You've done your best to help her. Think of yourself now. - You'll visit next week? - I promise. I love you. Thanks. I hope I won't be moving you back in 3 months. No way. It's a 2-year course. Sure. - Drive safely. - Right. Directing course, Assignment 1 : My new neighborhood. Well, catch it! I'll show you how. No, let me. I can do it myself. Alice in Wonderland Hi. What are you doing? I'm talking to you! Give it back. Jerk! - Here. - Thank you. Wait. You're very kind. Don't mention it. Thanks a lot. God bless you. Thanks. 5150 ELM'S WAY Sir? Yes? I just wiped out on my bike, and my derailleur and chain... - You ok? - Except for my ego. Training for the Tour de France? Is that your taxi? Yeah, but I'm off today. Could I use your phone to call one? Only take a minute. Wait here, I'll call for you. Thanks. Sir? Sir? Hello? Sir? Hey, Bernie, it's Beaulieu. What's up? No, I finished half an hour ago. I have chores to do. Help meI Help meI I didn't wreck it, you dolt! Help me! Help me! Curious, are we, kiddo? Look, I didn't see a thing. I'm outta here. What did I do? I didn't do anything! Open up! Let me out! Come out. Don't fool around. Open up! Open the door! He was snooping around. Help! Call the police! I said it's under controlI Call the police! You shouldn't have biked on our street. Michelle, jeez! You've no business here. Go downstairs. Sure I can't help? It'll be fine, dear. Sorry about that. Let me leave, ok? I can't. You might go to the police. No, I won't talk, I swear! I can't take the risk. Put yourself in my shoes. Hungry? Maude? Hello? Go ahead. You'll see, she makes the best spaghetti in town. Her sauce is amazing. Stop it, kid. Calm down. Take it easy. Jacques, don't! Jacques, stop! Not in front of the kids. You promised. Jacques! Alright. It's ok. Think things over. Shit! Shit! He got her sandwich and gave her a candy. Out of kindness. A real gentleman. Men like that are rare. He's one of the righteous, I'm sure. I know he's done nothing wrong, don't worry. Usually when I get home it's all over. I know I won't find... I said I'd take care of it. - Goodness! - Here, wait. It wasn't hot. - That's good. - It's ok. Any news about your project? My prof said my script was the best. That's no surprise. Course not, you gave me the idea. But you wrote it. Is this how? Will you shut the fuck up! Michelle, what's going on? - I said to leave him alone. - I can't sleep! Start by turning down that damn musicI You an amateur filmmaker? Like my daughter. She's making a movie at college for a course in... I'm not sure. You kids love all that audiovisual stuff. If you want to have breakfast with us.... Alright. Have a nice day. I sense, Lord, I sense that new trials await me. I thought I'd suffered enough, but... You must have Your reasons. Send me Your strength and light. Amen. MadameI Maude, right? You have to get me out of here. Maude? Don't worry. Jacques will find a solution very soon. Your husband's a lunatic. You don't realize... Jacques is my husband. I trust and obey him, as our Lord teaches. Maude. MaudeI MaudeI Help me, Maude! MaudeI If you find this, help me. I'm locked in a house because I saw... My name's Yannick Bérubé. I'm prisoner of a family of psychos. They're really dangerous. The family's name is Beaulieu. There are four... A father, mother, a teen girl... Michelle, I think. And a little girl. You have to call the police. Come get meI Get going. I need the toilet. Go ahead. You ok, kiddo? Yeah. Sit next to Michelle. Not with us! He has to eat. We'll just finish our game. - Did you play? - Yeah. King's Club Champion, 1985 Annual Championship, 2007 That's your move? Why? En passant capture. So? Mate in three. Ok, bravo. That's all? Dad, you've never lost a game so... I'm used to losing. What I mean is, it's normal that you lose now. You have to understand why if you want to beat me. Do you see my strategy? Why my Righteous Army won? Yeah, yeah. You don't seem sure. It's ready. Dad, are you ok? You bastard, think it's that easy? Michelle! Stop it! No unnecessary violence, I've told you 100 times! - Yeah, but... - No buts! You should kill him - like the others. It's simpler. - Help! Bastard! Go to your room! No TV for you tonight. No, don't move! Easy now! You alright? You'll be fine. Look. Michelle? Michelle! I'm sorry, I shouldn't have hit you. It wasn't righteous. She's not a bad girl, really. How many others? I heard what she said. How many did you kill? Only those who deserved it. How many? It's not important. What matters is, I'm righteous. I killed the unrighteous. Like the guy you saw here. Imagine, the bastard sold drugs to teens. You're out of your mind. That's what you think. Everyone would think I'm crazy. What do you know about me? About what I think? What do you know? Take it easy, nobody saw. I know nobody saw. That's not why I'm mad. Want me to kill him? You forget what I taught you. I'll have to start all over. No, it just came out. I didn't really mean it. Why'd you beat him? I got upset. I made a mistake. It won't happen again, I promise. You go to the chess club. I'll finish cleaning up. Hi, Jacques. Beautiful evening. Lovely, Mrs Gaudreault. Just lovely. Come on! Directing course, Assignment 1. My new neighborhood. Take 2. A room. Old paint. Boarded-over window. And that's... Directing course, Assignment 1. My new neighborhood. Take 2. A room. Old paint. Just fascinating! A real thriller. Boarded-over window. Nice camera. The ones at school are useless. You make dumb films and read kids' books. It's actually pretty cool. Yeah, right. Don't you realize your dad is psycho? He's not psycho. He has strict morals. Here, keep the change. Thank you. Come on. I'll bring some water. Come here. C'mon. I want to have kids one day. A son. I had a son, between Michelle and Anne. But he died at birth. Try again. Anne's delivery was so difficult, I can't have more kids. Jacques hasn't forgiven me. Come, dear. He has no reason to treat you like that. You don't deserve it. You deserve better. So does Anne. Come on, sweetie. Maude? You don't know what he did for me. You can't judge him. He won't get very far. Give him a chance. Told you. Oh boy! That's why I don't let you get your driver's license. I'll have to get it at some point. ...of Yannick Bérubé, who's been missing for a week. Stay with us. Ever wish the mirror showed a slimmer you? Hungry? Jacques? Shouldn't we talk? About what? Don't you trust me now? Of course I do. I'm alive! I'm alive! Off with her headI Let me out! You've no right! - I'll bust your other leg! - Beaulieu! MichelleI What were you doing? Nothing. Can't you see she wants to kill me! No. I think she only wants to scare you. She shares my principles. Fuck you and your principles! This is rat poison. We have mice in the house. Seen any? What are you going to do with me? Hello? Yeah, Maude? Michelle and I may not be back for supper. Don't wait. Why not? I want to see if Michelle is ready to take over. Already? I have doubts about her. But... My mission, chess, justice... Her heart's not in it. I don't want to hear about it. - Haven't you noticed? - No. I have to be sure she understands. Unlock the garage door. - Speak up. - Yes. See you later. How much longer will it take? What are we waiting for? Let's go. Dad, what are you...? But what...? Who is he? Why are you bashing him? This is your initiation. - Here, now? - Right now. You said you'd finish your project first. It's nearly done. Shouldn't you wait maybe? I'm initiating you now. I need to know. Jean-Guy Ruel, you and your sexual deviancy are disgusting. You are unrighteous. And so you must die. That is the True Law. You're fucking nuts! One thrust, Michelle, to the heart. Hurry, before he comes to. Michelle? - I can't! - Why not? No. I don't even know who he is. It doesn't matter. He's a pedophile. Unrighteous. It's not that. You fuck! Don't touch my dad! Michelle! Stop! No unnecessary violence. A clean kill, with no pain. Don't you get it? I'm sorry, Dad. I thought I could. But your theories... How could I be so wrong? You'll never be ready. Ever. Dad! Please! I'm still your daughter! I think this is yours. You try it on. Come on! Try it on. Don't be scared. Sit. Sit down. Two minutes. What are you doing? It looks better on you. Really, on screen, it gives you this look. It's nice to see you smile. Change your life. You'll smile non-stop. It's time, Maude. Right now. Easy, dear. Easy now. What are you doing? You mustn't do that. - Stop or else... - Or else what? Go back, Mr Yannick. Please! Stop. I beg you, stop. Stop! Trust me, Maude! I'm telling you, stop! I'll look after you. I was watching TV. I didn't hear him come down. I forgot to lock up when I brought his meal. He was so quiet. Dad, keep going. What did this last guy do? Did he smoke a joint? Steal a CD? What about me, shit? What'll you do with me? Beaulieu! BeaulieuI How much longer will he be here? Why are you so shocked? Dad's actions are righteous, aren't they? Aren't they? Hallelujah! Help! Can't escape from a single girl? Dad? Loser! Hey, kiddo? Kiddo? Beat me at chess. Win one game, just one, and you're free. I always play White. The Righteous Army. They're the Blacks. The Unrighteous. - This is ridiculous. - Go on. Go on! Do you have a choice? It's war, kiddo. The eternal combat of good vs. evil. I've never lost a game. I don't believe you. Never. Know why? Because what I do is right. Because I am righteous. Right out of your mind. Then beat me. A single victory. It'll mean I'm wrong. And if I'm wrong, I've no reason to keep you here. What a load of crap. Mate in three. Go on, you'll see. One. Two. Check. Three. Checkmate. But... Did you take my chess set? Yeah. A guy at work likes to play. He doesn't believe I'm a champ. Anyway, now you won't need it. We won't discuss that at dinner. As of tonight I'll spend my evenings with him. Don't disturb us. Goodness, you poor thing! Come with Mommy. Come on. We'll wipe off those beets. Are you mad at me, Dad? No, no. Don't worry. Car's parked. Hi. When's the movie? In an hour, so I can come in for a bit. Not here. How about your place? - My place? - Coming? I guess. Mate in four. Another game. We're all good at something. Me, it's chess. What about you? Making movies. But since you messed up my term... Besides that? I dunno. Oh boy! That bad? Must be tough, being such a loser. I'm not a loser. You are at chess. Mate in four. Another game! Mate in three. Mate in two. Mate in five. Well... Guess that's enough for tonight. Anyway, you still don't buy it. Goddamn loser! Poor loser. Matisse! Matisse, we have to go. How do you feel? Fine. Just great. I'm sorry about what happened. It was... But you've never lost since I've known you. Even at your chess club. Yannick can't win against you. I know. Then why did you make the deal with him? Maude, I know what I'm doing. I don't want you to tell Michelle. Understand? You jerkI What an idiotI Go ahead, take my bishopI Knight. Fucking idiotI So that's it. What? Don't you get it, you jerk? Don't you see what he's planning? What do you mean? It'll never happen. Why'd you come here? Why'd you have to fuck things up for us? Michelle! Please. You're gonna pay, I swear! So the guy asks her, ''Do you have PMS?'' The chick flings her coffee in his face. I nearly bust a gut. Yeah, but now you have to wash your taxi. - Think I'm blind? - Pardon? I know your plan for Yannick. Look, it seems my daughter and I have things to discuss. Go easy on your dad. You left me no choice. Where am I in all this? - I don't know. - You don't know? You refused the role I offered. I'm still your daughter. Not here, ok? We'll discuss it later. So, how's your little film for college? Coming along? A real big action film you're shooting, huh? Check. And mate in 5. I'll go take a leak. Why are you here? I said I don't want to be disturbed. Go see Mom. Go on. I said to go downstairs. Anne? Where are you, honey? - You little bitch! - Jacques! She poisoned my coffee. - What? - She put rat poison in it. Jacques, stop! You saw, didn't you? You hoped I'd drink it. You know what? Even if I'd needed an ambulance, even if I'd died... You might've gotten away. But you wouldn't have won. Even if I die, and you get away, it won't prove I'm wrong. Still no news of Yannick Bérubé, the 22-year-old who disappeared mysteriously five weeks ago. The police are continuing their investigation and ask that all clues and information be reported to them. Here is this afternoon's press conference at the Courthouse. That'll feel better. Take a few steps. As good as new. You worried for nothing. A game? I know it's my turn, but we can't meet here. It's complicated, we just can't. What's wrong, Maude? You haven't been yourself lately. No, no. Do you want to talk? Maude? I have to go. Explain to Father Jean. Regional Psychiatric Institute Check. And mate in 3. You're improving. But you'll still never beat me. Jacques! What's this? You promised me you'd never place her. Ever! Maude, she's getting worse. She tried to poison me. If you place her, I'm leaving. Oh yeah? And what then? You can't even work in a corner store. How would you manage with a handicapped child? You can't place her. It's not righteous. She's your child. It's your fault she's like that. You punched me while I was pregnant! I told you not to... - Jacques, stop! - What you gonna do now? You're useless! Let him go! Maude. We'll visit you often, dear. It's only a 10-minute drive. And look, you have lots of nice friends. I'll sign the papers. Don't worry, treasure. You won't stay here long. Mommy promises you. Check. Why'd I move my rook? Mate in 5. It's so easy for him. You'll never win. Don't touch your rook! I can't. I can't stay here. This can't be it. I gotta leave. Right now. Right now. You should see outside. For a first snowfall... Let's play, right now. Get the table. I don't have time. I have to go shopping. Maude! Seems I need new shoes. Beats me. These ones are fine. But you know women. We'll leave this in case we're not back by suppertime. Anybody home? Michelle? Dammit! Open up, somebody! Open up! Jacques! Know how long I've been working on this set? Kiddo? 15 years. 15 years! 15 years I've been creating the most perfect, the truest of chess sets. For 15 years, every time I meet a scumbag, a criminal, an unrighteous person, I kill them and make them a member of the Black Army. Like him. Like our little drug dealer. Remember? Such a loser, he was only fit to be a pawn. 15 years. 15 years too of looking for good, generous people. Righteous. Pouring over the obituaries to find people worthy of joining my White Army. Going to cemeteries at night, digging them up. Like Mrs Dagenais, a social worker, who devoted her life to poor kids. Like Jacques Jr. My child. My son. Died leaving his mother's womb. I'd have taught him everything, to carry on my great mission. I could never find a better king for my White Army. I'm missing only one piece. The white queen. To complete my work. Confrontation. Good versus evil. And just when I'm nearly done, you enter my life. It can't be coincidence. I finally understood. What do you mean? I thought Michelle would carry on, but... She doesn't get it. Christ! Christ! You're a fucking maniac. You're a fucking maniac! It won't work. Not even if we play for five years and I lose 10,000 games. It won't work! No! Never! You'll never convince me. Never! I'll never be like you. You're a fucking madman! Beaulieu! Fuck you, come back here! Come back here and untie me! I'll show you that you're crazy. Untie me, you fucking prick! Yannick... You can do itI YannickI WinI You're rightI Show himI Win! Feeling better? I want to play. Draw. What? Draw. We could play all night, nobody will win. What do you mean? Another game. No, I'm tired. Afraid of losing? Get real. Chicken! Another! Don't start, kiddo. Come on, don't you want to? - Lay off. - Dad, react! - Back to your room. - Come on, let's play! Go! Drop that! Go up to your room! Afraid of losing, huh? Get your hands off! No! - It's ok, I'll do it, Dad. - You! Keep out of it! Mind your business! I never want to see you again! Get upstairs. Get upstairs! Listen to him, Mr Yannick. I'm begging you, listen to him. Get upstairs! Tomorrow. Tomorrow I beat you, Beaulieu. I'm gonna beat you, you fuckI You'll all see what I'm capable of. You'll seeI What were you hoping for? He'd come back for you and have me arrested? - Jacques, it wasn't me. - Liar! Admit it was you! Admit it! Yes, it was me. Happy now? It was me. I'm only sorry it didn't work. I'm sorry. Violence is wrong. Jacques, stop! Violence is wrong. Stop! Violence is wrong. Stop! I'll look for an apartment. So I can move out ASAP. That way, I won't be in your way. Do what you want. I know I will. It's your life, Michelle. Maude, I... You're right, Jacques. About everything. I owe you everything. I finally see that. God sent Yannick to test me. I nearly succumbed. But fortunately you made me see reason. Forgive me. I'll never oppose you again. I've understood. All is forgiven, my love. I'll find a solution for Yannick tonight. I promise. Spread your legs. What? I didn't have the key. That's better. I'll call a taxi. Jacques starts in an hour, we're safe. Hello? Yes, for 5150 Elm's Way, please. Thank you. First we'll pick up Anne. Yes. Then we'll go to the police. You'll testify in my favor, won't you? Like you promised. I'm trusting you. Come on! Thanks to you, the police will see that it wasn't my fault. That... That I'm just a poor woman, none too bright, that I let myself be influenced. But with you, I have faith. With you, nothing can stop me. I'll finally be happy with my little treasure. Anne will be so happy. Come on. She's so sensitive. You noticed that, didn't you? I saw how much you liked her. I think she likes you too. But she feels so lonely. Just like me. Let's go! What's wrong? Get in! Yannick? - What are you doing? - I have to beat him. But why? Don't do this! I have to beat him, Maude. You're not serious? But... The police will arrest him. It's not enough. What do you mean, not enough? He's wrong, he has to see it. You're crazy! This is nuts. You can't! Think of me! You told me... I'll beat him. In front of you, Michelle, everyone! Isn't that enough? That's not what you promised. To free me, not to beat him. If I beat him, you'll be free. And if you don't? I will beat him. Tonight, for sure. Don't abandon me, Yannick. Alone, without you, I'll never make it. Don't abandon me. Don't abandon me! Maude... It'll all work out. It'll all work out. You lied to me. Like Jacques. Like God. You all lied to me. It's all over tonight. Let's say I move my pawn to A8. I'll protect my knight. No, bad idea. Castle to F4. He'll have to go queen to B4. I'll move my pawn, then my knight. He'll try to attack... Maude? Isn't lunch ready? Maude? MaudeI NoI We have to play. It's your fault she did it. You got her all mixed up. You've become unrighteous. You have to die! It's your fault. It's your fault! You locked me up here. It's you who's unrighteous. It's you. We'll see about that. We'll see. What are you doing, Beaulieu? Where are you going? This way, kids. Back inside. That's it, stay in line. Karl! Guys! I don't have a tape. I have one, wait. Yeah. We'll make a copy and give the prof, like three days to tell us what he thinks. Anne? Anybody seen Anne? It's done. I have my white queen. We'll play one last game. Whoever wins will... take it from there. There we go. If you find this, help me. I'm locked in a house... Shit, that's... That's the guy who's always in the news. An insane family's... The guy the cops are looking for. This is so fucked up. Knight. The family's name is Beaulieu. A father, mother, teen girl... Michelle, I think. That's you! It's... Check. Knight. He works for a taxi company. Call the policeI Come get me. Check. Queen. Queen. Pay attention. Concentrate. If he moves his queen to the left of your knight, he wins in four. But if he takes your pawn, you win in three moves. It's almost over, my love. Anne? Go upstairs now. I said go upstairs. Obey your father. Anne? Go away! Go away! Get off me! Get off me, you monster! Get off me! Beaulieu. Let's finish the game. Come on, we have to play. Beaulieu? We have to finish the game, ok? Come on! Wake up! Beaulieu! We have to finish, fuck! 4 months later Most experts believe that Jacques Beaulieu, who still has not spoken, will likely be sent to a psychiatric hospital. The older daughter has not been found, but police are confident their investigation will lead them to her. I'm not going. Yann... You need help. You should go. What would you have done? Moved your queen like this or this? Like this. Play. You'll never win. Play. You have to play, Beaulieu. We have to finish the game. Beaulieu?
