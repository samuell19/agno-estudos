This story happened long ago, when I was very small. My grandmother told me that a travelling circus troupe visited my village. How beautiful! THE TRAVELLING CIRCUS Produced by Tran Khai Hoang Production Designer Pham Nguyen Can Music Hoang Hiep Director of Photography Dinh Anh Dung Screenplay Pham Thuy Nhan Editor Lam Tran Directed by Viet Linh Boss, there's somebody over there. What is this place? A cemetery? They call them "houses of the dead". Hello, boy. - Is your village far from here? - It's over there. We want to go to the village. Can you guide us? - What's your name? - Dac. - And the little one? - Poupon. Whose grave is this? Our Mother's. What a nice monkey! Will you sell it to me? It's not for sale. Please take us to your village. Their houses look so funny, like bird cages! Where is everyone? Working in the fields, far away. Why far away? The land here is exhausted. We can't grow rice and corn anymore. Everyone's gone? Only old people and kids stay at home. The village is deserted, Boss. What's the point of staying here? Let's see the Village Chief first. Who are you? We are a group of travelling performers. What do you perform? We do magic. Amazing feats! Why have you come here? We heard there was gold around here. We've come to perform for your village. Our villagers are starving. We need to fill our stomachs, not be entertained. And we don't have any gold. The gold is in the mountains. Is it easy to find? Yes, but we don't have time. Right now, we have to find enough food to eat. Have you been to see the Chief? Yes. He said that it's your decision. You are the representative of the gods. We plan to stay for only a few days. Our villagers are starving. Food is our priority. Dac! Where are you? I need a drink. Where is God? Why doesn't he just kill us all! That's Dac's father. He works for my family. - Is he crazy? - He works for wine instead of money. If only God would kill us all. Come on! Agree to let us do a trial performance. If there's no audience, we'll leave. What's wrong with that? Is your child sick? The Moon God is punishing all the village children with an itchy rash. I have some medicine that will cure them. Magic medicine? I hope you have a lot of it... many children are cursed. Gather them all together. I'll take care of them. Thank you. May the Holy Spirits fulfill all your desires. I desire to stay for several days. Miss Lan! Dac! Where have you been? Looking for food. Lan! Have the boy show you the stream, and have a bath. - Will you take me to the stream? - Yes. - Is it far? - Very close. Just a stone's throw away. Hey boy, do you know where to find grass for my horse? What's a horse? This animal here. If you show me where to find grass, I'll let you watch the magic show for free. What's a magic show? Amazing things, you won't believe your eyes! Come tonight and you'll see! - This is a very long "stone's throw"! - Just a little farther. What leaves are you picking? Medicinal leaves. Poupon is under the Moon God's curse. What do you mean? She has a rash all over her body. It's probably scabies. I'll give you some medicine for her. There's the stream! Thank you. Come to see me when you have time. Roll it up. OK, go! Turn around. Done! Who's next? Haven't you finished yet, slowpoke? It's damn boring. What will Boss think of next? - Help me out! - Sure. My hand is about to fall off. See how it's done? At your place, it would take until tomorrow! - Here, have some. - I've already eaten. We can start now. No more people will come. You look so beautiful. After this trip, you'll perform in a professional troupe. There's a lot of gold around here. But the villagers only care about their fields. - They'll come. - How do you know? Wait and see. It's almost time for your scene. Go to sleep. You stay at home. I'm going out. - Where are you going? - To the Chiefs. Sleep now. Dac... is there anything to eat? Calm down, Lan. But they didn't enjoy it. They will. Cheer up! You don't belong here. You'll make it in the big time. I promise you. When will it happen? When? When we have enough money. I'm doing everything for you. Do you know that, my little girl? Please, you promised me. I'm sorry. Go to sleep, dear. I'm afraid that nobody will come tomorrow. Don't worry. I'll find a solution. Sleep now. You look exhausted. A pair of fours. Sevens! You're losing. Ha! We'll see who wins in the end! Will you sell me your basket? What for? I like it because it's beautiful. Just like you. I'm not! Look, will you trade with me? Uncle! Here's the grass. Thank you. - Is Miss Lan in? - She's in the tent. Miss Lan! Hello Dac. Come in. Come on in. Why are you so late? Where's Poupon? I took her to the Chiefs house. - Is her rash better? - It's gone! These are for you. How lovely! - Where did you find them? - In the forest. What happened to your leg? - My father beat me. - Why? Because I came to see you last night. You came to see the show, not me! Show me your leg. Does it hurt much? I'm used to it. Come closer. I'll apply some ointment. Sister Lan, do you have a mother? Mother? No, I'm an orphan. Me too. You still have your father. But he's drunk all the time. I can't go out right now. Wait for me at the stream this afternoon. Take this ointment home. Hey boy! Come here. You have a nice bow. Can I see it? Shall we make an exchange? Who the hell are you planning to shoot with that? I'll exchange it for some food. My sister's hungry. The rice is not mine to give. Oh, I know... Want to trade it for this? You can blow bubbles for your sister to make her forget her hunger. Like this! How cute! It's for you. - Really? - Yes. Did Poupon agree? Yes. Will you be staying here long? I don't know. It's up to Boss. - You work for him? - Yes. Is he as cruel as a tiger? No, he's very kind. He brought me up since I was small. He taught me to read and trained me for the circus. He promised that after this tour, he'll send me to a big troupe. Where are they going? To the fields? They're going to pan for gold so they can watch your show. There'll be new magic tonight! What new magic? I don't know. That's what your boss told the villagers. Make him some clothes. We'll create a new scene. Another performing monkey! - Does it have a name? - Dac calls it "Sao". Sao, where are you? Please come back to me! Hey fatty! Help me get out of this. Boss is so clever. We'll sell out tonight! That's why he's the boss. Not everyone's as stupid as you. I'm not stupid. I'm just honest. Honest? Me too. Is this a water xylophone? It doesn't work now, the stream's too low. With higher water, it sounds so beautiful. Like this. Watch out! A poisonous snake! What? A poisonous snake? Don't worry. Dac killed it. Don't go far from camp again. You know it makes me worry. Finish getting ready. You'll be a star tonight! What's this basket for? You'll see. Rice! This is rice! Real rice! Give everybody a handful of rice. A handful of what, Boss? A handful of rice, you idiot. Go on! Boss! They love us! You're so clever. No, I don't believe it. It's true. The fat guy covered the basket. Lan knocked three times with a wand. And a man beat the gongs three times. She knocked, and the basket became full of rice. I saw it with my own eyes! If you want to eat, your hands have to work. And your head has to brave the rain and sunshine. There are no miracles, child. So where did the rice came from? Everybody received a handful. There are no miracles. Listen to me. Don't believe it. Nothing happened! Try again. What the hell are you doing? Well, what? Where is God? If only God would kill us all. I'd die. You'd die. Oh my Dac! Poupon, go to sleep. I'm hungry. Go to sleep now. Does it look nice? Yes, so beautiful. Even more beautiful than my mother. - Do you like it? - Very much. You are so kind to me. I don't know how to thank you. I'll ask Boss for cloth to make Poupon a shirt. I don't like cloth. I don't like your boss. Why don't you like him? I don't know. I just don't like him. I don't like him much, either. But he's my benefactor. Would you like this bag? Don't you like it? So what do you need? Tell me. I want to help you. Truly? Yes. I like you very much. Tell me. Sister Lan, teach me how to make rice. Ah, that's it. But it's difficult. We need to have tools. What tools? A basket, a piece of cloth, and so on. But it's very difficult. I'll show you later. Really, Sister Lan? Swear by the gods! Do you see? This basket has two parts. This part contains rice. When I raise the cloth... Dac wants to know how to make rice. I'm showing him. Really? Another time, boy. We're quite busy today. Go on home. Come tomorrow and we'll continue. Goodbye. What are you doing? Do you know what he really wants? I think he's just curious. Curious? You're so naive. It's a professional secret. You are not allowed to reveal it. Understand? Where did you get this? Dac gave it to me. It was his mother's. Wear this during the performance tonight. So lovely! Hey everybody! I know how to do the miracle. Tomorrow we'll have rice for our meal. I will make rice for everyone! Chief! Miss Lan showed me how to do the miracle. I've learned half of the secret. Tomorrow I'll make rice. I'll feed you. I'll feed my father. I don't believe it. There are no miracles. It's true. I've learned the first half already. Don't you believe me? I know the secret. Everybody believes in miracles. You too. You're not listening to me. Hello. Here. This is for you. Go ahead, take it. Is your husband in? Yes. He's making offerings to the spirits for an ill person. He's almost done. Please, don't stay here any longer. Why? You agreed to let us stay for several days. Because you helped my child and other village children. But the situation is getting worse. What's getting worse? Our villagers abandon their fields. They only care about finding gold to watch your show. They will starve. Leave our village! We won't go. We'll hold a village meeting. We'll see who wins. People here are so strange. They go hungry just to watch our performances. I heard that last night, they didn't even attend the village meeting. They like Lan's scene. They believe it's a miracle. They really believe it? Of course! People here are so naive. Why don't we tell them that it's just an illusion? To let them believe it is cruel. If they know the truth, who would come to watch? Boss has thought it all out. We have to be practical. I feel guilty too. But if we take pity on them, who'll take pity on us? We both have children to feed. Just turn a blind eye to it. Uncle, here's the firewood. Thank you. Come to see our show tonight. Do you know how to make rice like Miss Lan? No, I only play the trumpet for the monkey scene. Why do you ask? I want to make rice. My sister is hungry. I don't know. I only play the trumpet. I have to do the smoke tonight. Should I ask the kid to play the gongs for me? Sure. He's a good boy. Ask him. Hey boy... Would you like to replace me on the gongs tonight? But I have to attend the village meeting. Skip it. Who would listen to such a young boy anyway? You stay at home. I'm going out. Don't go! I'm going to the village meeting. I'll be back soon. Go back to sleep. Enough! May the gods forgive me. Oh, God of the Mountain, God of the River, the Moon God... ...the God of... God of... Wind! The God of Wind... You're so clever. People will love to see me dressed like this. The God of Corn... ...the God of... God of... Rice! ...the God of Rice. Ye gods, gather together here. Dac! You've abandoned our fields. You've abandoned your sister. Where are you? Give it back! Give it back to them. Do you hear me? Why don't you move? Give it back. Go! Where's your son? Looking for gold. Where are your parents? Looking for gold. Where's Dac? In the fields. Sister Lan, please teach me. Why do you want to know it? To make rice. It's impossible. So where does the rice come from? It's already in the bag. Oh, I don't know. You know. But you're afraid of your boss. I really don't know. Don't ask me again! Dac! Dac! Come on. Dac keeps asking about my performance. It seems he believes the basket can really make rice. He's also asked me. He really believes it. I thought he was just curious. No, it's not curiosity. He wants to make rice. His sister is hungry. The whole village is going hungry. Lan, don't tell Boss that I told you. About what? About Dac. Lan, where are you going? I'm going to Dac's house. Don't go, please. Boss told me not to let you go out. If he returns while you're gone, he'll kill me. I want to give him some rice. Not a good idea. What if Boss finds out? I feel sorry for him. His sister's so hungry. All the villagers are hungry. Do you have enough rice for all of them? Eat this. Poupon, try to sleep. Tomorrow I'll get you a big corn cob. Sleep, or the Moon God will get you. I'm not stupid, I'm just honest. Thief! Trying to steal, eh? Take him to the Village Chief. Come on! Let's go. Thank you. Last night, Dac tried to steal the basket and Boss caught him. Lan, where are going? Why are you beating him? We are not allowed to steal things in this village. Dac, why did you do that? I want to make rice. Poupon is hungry. All the villagers are hungry. You can't do it. Why not? I've seen it with my own eyes. Sister Lan, tell me the truth. You know the secret, don't you? No, I don't It's just a trick. No, it's real! Your boss said so. Don't hide it! No, believe me. The villagers are naive. You've used them. No, that wasn't my intention. Go away from here! Just leave us. The villagers are starving. Don't make things worse. Go away and leave us alone! Please... Go! Show us how to do the miracle! No, I don't know it! Make rice for us! Did you tell the villagers that the basket is magical and can really make rice? Who told you that? Just tell me. Is it true? Yes. Why did you do that? How could we deceive them? We did not mean to deceive them. But the villagers here are in need of rice, not magic shows. And we need gold, do you understand? A pair of fours. - Fives! - Jacks. A pair of Kings! Dac! Poupon? My dear Poupon! Why should we be held responsible for your villagers' hunger or starvation? We did not force them to watch our shows, or to abandon their fields. Our villagers are naive. They trusted you. You've abused their naivety. Go tell that to your villagers. We'll perform as long as we have an audience. I thought you held a village meeting? The gods will punish you. Our villagers will punish you. Punish us? Our villagers will punish you. What's wrong with you? That poor boy! It's my fault Poupon died. Your box of soap wasn't the only cause of her death. All of this gold will be yours. I beg you. We'll leave after this show. No, I don't want to perform anymore. Boss, they're shouting for Lan. What should we do? Do something to calm them down. She'll come out. Lan, listen to me. Just once more. Then your dreams will come true. Please! No... no! I won't go out there! You must go out. I'm your boss. I order you! No, no! Lan, forgive me. I've never treated you like that. Can't you hear them? They'll kill us. I've protected and cared for you for 10 years. What kind of gratitude is this? Lan, just one more time. Do you want me to kneel down at your feet? No, no. - Get out there! - No! They're lying! There's no miracle. It's a deception! Liars! Boss, what should we do now? Is there a miracle? Yes! No, there's not. Is there? Yes! Tell us! We'll show you tomorrow! Go away. Get out of my house! I don't want to see your face anymore. I don't want to see anybody. Get out of my house, you bastard! You fool. It's all your fault! Get out of my house! And don't come back. Dac, what's wrong? What's the matter child? Don't be sad. Try to sleep. Tomorrow we'll go to the fields. Dac! Dac! Faster! They can't catch us. Faster, faster! If you want to eat, your hands have to work. And your head has to brave the rain and sunshine. There are no miracles, my son. THE END
