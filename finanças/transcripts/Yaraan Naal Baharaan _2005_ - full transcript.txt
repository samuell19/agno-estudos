Ripped by gdhaliwal23 Brother Pammi... the man from Bhatinda! The door's open. - But I'll still have to open it. Here already to chew on my brains? Couldn't you wait a bit longer? But it's already daytime out there Guess what? I had such a lovely dream Really...? I was taking a trip through paradise. Opium trees on tall mountains all around... streams flowing with liquor... intoxicants strewn about everywhere. And you land here with the rotten tea? Try a sip, will you, please? It'll have you wide awake. The whole of my body's stiff. How about a dash of opiate? No, sir... no adulteration for me It's tough to even add sugar to it. So better you commit the sin, sir Shame on these landlords! His parents must be boasting that their son studies at the university O lion of Haryana... O Lord... open the door, please! The door's open. - This one, too...? Wow! Mighty lord! You are really into tough work-outs, aren't you? But you can never woo a girl. - Don't talk about girls I'm into the third year, can't afford to mess around with girls Why would you mess around with girls? But suppose a girl decides to mess around with you? I don't care for girls! They belong at my feet Besides, what harm can she do to me? No, she can't But suppose a girl takes your hand and says, I want to marry you ? You don't really know my Uncle If he gets to know, he's going blast my head with a club! You're such a muscleman...why're you so scared of your uncle? Got to be, if I know what's good for me Come to my village and take a look. My uncle has a hand as large as this One blow and I'll be done with for good Is that your uncle or some wrestler? What? Your milk! - Where? What am I going to do with this little milk? He's an okay guy, but he's obsessed with his uncle Got to meet this Uncle of his some day! Tea, brother Harvinder. - It's open Come on in, Ginda. - Use my full name, please It isn't just Ginda. It's Ginda Mann Since when have you become a Mann? - Try and get the picture Just as it's necessary to be a Khan to become an actor. You got to be a Mann to make it as a singer! Never mind about me. Here's some tea I must say, you're the only guy in the whole of the hostel... who studies so hard and justifies every penny... your parents are spending My father doesn't own any land. Else, why would I study so hard? Just snatch their land and see how they'll study all day and night I see. So there are two types of the studious ones Two types...? - Oh yes.The first are the needy... and the other category is those of the lovers! Lovers...? - "I'm dying to write to you... I burn the midnight oil, reading to myself, my love Hey Ginda... - Brother Deep! You must be eating a lot of honey. No wonder you have such a sweet voice Do I really have a sweet voice, bro? Surely better than the singers on tv Actually, I used to idolise Gurdass Mann I actually came here to become a singer... but ended up being a help in the mess Not to worry. This dream of yours will also come true Want me to bring some milk to your room? You don't drink tea anyway Tea, I cannot drink. Daddy says tea's meant for those in the city But you can at least romance the girls in the city, can't you? What say...? Get me some milk These city-bred guys really have a ball We ride around on swanky bikes, but no girl encourages us Forget about encouraging us, they don't say "hello" to us I wonder why these girls are allergic to us from the villages In Haryana, it's considered to be a shame to run after a girl The thing to do is to grab her hand and say, Hop aboard, let's go Here she is Deep, go ahead and say hello to her today Sure, I will. What's the big deal? Can't you see? If it wasn't for them, I had it made. And they chose this time to butt in Are we hanging around for a reason? Let's attend class You must surely be wondering who I am I'm your new botany-teacher. Mandeep Mini...? Have you taken an admission again in the class? I'm sorry, but I'm here to teach. You may surely call me "Madam" I see. So I'm now your student! What an irony! We even meet again in the same class. Right, Mini? Could you call me "Madam", please? My word, Mini! I simply love this! You guys must be wondering what the two of us are talking about Actually, Mini and I had joined the college together... in the same year Today, Mini is so educated, she has become a teacher And I've flunked so many terms, I'm still in the university Actually, when we studied together, I used to call her just "Mini" However much she grows in stature... I'll still call her "Mini”, isn't it? But I'm your teacher now! - You and I are the same age, Mini How can I call you "Madam" ? In the class, I'm madam to everyone. Including you What a dilemma! I can't even disobey you I have an idea. In the class, I'll call you Mini Madam But outside, you'll remain Mini to me... tiny Mini! If you don't mind, could you please take your seat? Sorry, I forgot. Actually, I happened to walk down memory lane How about some studies? Rangeela has it made. He's taken a fancy for madam She's such a bombshell! If I were in Rangeela's shoes... I'd have been following her too. - Stop fibbing! You don't even have the nerve to say "hello" to a girl! Why must I have the nerve? For me, a girl will arrive from Canada and fly away with me As if the ones in Canada are dying for you! Don't live on hopes, okay? No one's taking you abroad... and you're going to remain a bachelor Fetch some milk Know what? Give up the dope you take every morning You don't know... I feel euphoric all day, after I've had an early shot Euphoric or devastated? Hey look away! Rangeela's coming Wherever you choose to look, this is the table he's coming to How're you doing,brother Rangeela? - Here's a respectful chap! It's obvious that he comes from a cultured family You guys are sipping plain tea? This is not fair! Waiter, get me two cheese-sandwiches and a milkshake. Large glasses, please Will you guys have something to eat? Help yourself We get enough to eat. - Now listen, you from Bhatinda It's time you learnt how to talk to your seniors! Now listen, if there's any job you want done in the department.. Just let me know. I'm really thick with Madam Mini! Maybe you're thick with her. How are we concerned? There are all sorts of problems Your lectures are going to be short anyway That's when you'll find me useful. Madam Mini's a buddy, you see You're just bragging. Madam just doesn't encourage you Get the hint, guys! She can't show it to the class that we have a thing going Another thing. Don't get friendly with just about anyone There are a lot of freeloaders around. One's sitting right here at the moment Where are you from? - Haryana That's okay. But let me tell you something If you want something done in Haryana, just let me know An uncle of mine is a minister in Haryana The sandwich is untouched. Nobody's eating it I might as well take the sandwich along... will wash it down with the milkshake Sorry, guys, there are other newcomers to take care of See you again Quite a smartass. He had a meal at our expense and chewed our brains too You know that boy in our class...? - Which one? Pavan! Who does he think he is? I'm going to teach him a lesson Stop getting into fights with everyone. She's sitting there all alone. Go and say hello to her today! I think I will. It's over a month...time to get into action Of course! Go ahead! Excuse me, a friend of mine was sitting there That's okay. I'll get up when she returns Okay... what is it? I had to talk to you... - What is it about? Your name is Harman, isn't it? - Yes... but why ask? Any doubts? Oh no, no doubts at all. I'm Navdeep My friends lovingly call me Deep. - Really You can call me Deep, too I will decide what name I'm going to call you Don't misunderstand me. I just wanted us to be acquainted with each other We're in the same class and might need each other's help Sorry, I'm never going to need your help You really might. - We'll see when that happens Is that all you had to say? There's so much to say! Actually, I came to you to complain about something Complain...? - To appear in someone's dreams... to torment him, to rob him of his sleep... is that a nice thing to do? Tell me... is that really done? To drive a man to sleeplessness all day and all night... why do you do that, Harman? You're giggling away and someone's life is at stake! But I'm not doing it on purpose. So what can I do? Stop entering my thoughts, that's it. Then? Then I'll start entering your thoughts Really? Your peace, your sleep... I'll snatch it all from you Remember one thing. A day like that is never going to arrive Suppose it does? Shall we...? What was he saying? What happened? Bull's eye! Take it for granted that she's going to ride pillion with me! Wait... I want to join in, too! - C'mon. Where have you been? I'm glad you've come to stay with us at the hostel Harman, you haven't told us what Navdeep had to say to you? He said, “I'm going to appear in your dreams... I'm going to rob you of your peace and sleep And what did you say to him? I said, “ Keep on trying. All the best The colour drained out of his face when he heard that These guys are so very romantic in the beginning But once you fall in love with them... they take you for a jolly good ride Don't see you see them making a beeline for us, early in the day? Sukhi, give that guy in the turban a smile now and then Else, the poor guy's going to lose his life I don't know about anybody else But Harman and Navdeep are really going to be a great pair Excuse me... what makes us a pair? Why not? He's the hero among the boys... and you're the prettiest among the girls The most handsome guy has fallen for you If only he had called me with love... I'd have followed him like a kitten You may take your seat,Rangeela-ji. - That I will do... a very old procedure anyway. Madam, you have a rare charm... no student misses your class. - I know that... so please stop flattering me. And please come to the point The students say, if one has to learn about flowers... why not live among them? - All right, I have no objections We can always go to the University's Botanical Garden Why not go out of Chandigarh, madam? There are so many beautiful places Where would you like to go? The Pinjore Garden, perhaps? - Very well We'll go anywhere you say Pinjore garden! What a petty idea! If we have to go somewhere, why not go to Kullu or Manali.What say? Yes, I will call So where's your girlfriend? - She'll be here any moment - You? - Yes. You've carried some woolens I hope? - Sure Look at them sitting with their heads drooping! They're behaving as if they're going to attend a funeral! I'm taking you to the beautiful valleys of Himachal... to Kullu Take a seat, will you? Give up the mike sometimes You have the ball rolling, so why not do something for me? Please take a seat, Rangeela-ji How can I sit without you? You ought to understand! Sit! Will you keep standing? Sit down! Go on! Pavan, what's that flower called? - I have no idea Why're you always angry...? Can't you speak lovingly sometimes? When was I angry...? This is the way I am Really? Do you want me to teach you how to speak lovingly then...? What's she up to...? No... don't... Uncle! - Uncle? Where springs Uncle from? All right, I'll let you be today But if you don't speak lovingly to me again, I'll... God! I was almost done in! Amazing thing, the flower On barren lands, in the lap of nature, it blossoms on its own Guess why it's smiling That's because it wants you to chat it up How do you know? - Take a closer look You'll find its fragrance lingering in your breath Know what? The flower even talks That's exactly why the bees keep hovering above it There maybe many bees... but it's just one it falls for, isn't it? But the bee's been humming away... the flower refuses to listen Which flower are you talking about? The one that wears a pink dress, with flowers on it Harman... All the students are busy working. Why don't you do something too? I'm the one who'll do what really needs to be done... The rest of them are up to nothing. - What? I mean, I've been studying for years together Why did you suggest this place if you didn't want to do something? I thought I'd take them all to Kullu... who knows, something might give? What might give? There are things I can't tell you in everybody else's presence, Mini There's something I wish to tell you. But I just can't muster the courage Think twice before you speak.Else, I'll have you thrown out of college For God's sake, Mini... don't scare me any further. I'm already so nervous. - All right. Speak up May I...? - Goon May I really spring the question? - Go ahead, I say Actually, Mini, I've always been... No. You'll have me thrown out of the college Rather you don't say a word. Okay? Madam... - Did they have to butt in now? Ma'am, the boys are bothering us Lies! It's the girls who are bothering us You guys are such idiots! I've been dying for someone to bother me... but she won't! He says, “Why must you bother about flowers...? You have flowers on your dress' - But that's not offensive, Ma'am? It was only a compliment! One must have a sense of humour. Don't fight. I know what you're getting at Quite honestly... the beautiful weather of Kullu has begun having its effect We'll continue the argument, but we'll do it in the form of a song The girls versus the boys, okay? Harman, you start the argument Don't worry. Madam won't say anything. I stand guarantee for that, okay? Get cracking, what are you waiting for? Get started! What's up...? Have they deserted you? So you're left all alone? How reserved they were all at the university... I wonder what's gotten into them out here They're so much into each other... they're oblivious to everything else Just as flowers need a special season to blossom... love needs a special season too You think this togetherness of a few moments is love? Maybe it's the beginning of love Love is an amazing feeling. You never know when it happens But once it happens, the whole world appears to have changed The one who has fallen in love ought to know You can ask me too. It makes life so beautiful You've actually gone mad Don't you ever feel like having someone to love you too? Now look at me; I thought of bringing a gift for a crazy girl Maybe it'll be reason enough for her to think of this crazy chap What would you like to eat, Madam? - Gol-gappas How would you like them? Sweet, spicy or sour? All of them. - Sure, let me give you a plate Goodness me! What a delicious idea, Mini-ji! Gol-gappas early in the day? Have you nothing else to do? Why're you bothering me again? Why don't you have some too, sir? - I'd like to... but it wouldn't be nice for me to to eat it at a streetside place? What's wrong with that? When I can eat here, why can't you? Goodness me! The way you're telling me, I'd even swallow poison with a smile! Command me! And be sure I'm going to eat everything this guy has! Even if it gives me an upset tummy! Provided you eat with me, okay? - Sure, I will Now that's something! So let's get cracking, Sardarji Hey listen... May I? - Sure Wait... I'm going to feed you one with my own hands No... - You'll have to! Don't worry. Nobody's seen us If you're free from your whiskers, may I make a request? My dear Gujarati lady... what else do we Punjabis possess, except our proud whiskers? They're the pride of the Punjabis! Upright moustache, isn't it? - Okay Just okay? Say it in the style of Gujaratis... lovingly. Upright, or not? Nice moustache. Okay? - Aah! I'm slain! The twirl of my moustache... God Almighty! I'm almost dead and he's singing songs! Doesn't he worry about anything? Why fret, dear? Great crisp whiskers. Not a soul can cough on the borders I'm not talking about the borders. It's about our daughter Daughter? What happened to her? - She's away on a university trip I've been calling for two days, but she won't take my calls Oh, I'm so worried. - My dear Gujarati wife... you've been living with me for the last 25 years in Punjab You've even learnt to cook the famous Punjabi mustard-leaves dish You've learnt to love like the Punjabis ... and even fight like the Punjabis But you're still as scared as the Gujaratis! Pay some heed to my whiskers! Whiskers again! Are you just not worried about your daughter? There's no news from her. - No news? There comes our good news! Come to me, my child. - Thank God, my daughter's back How was your trip, dear? - Great! It was so much of fun! Why was your cellphone switched off? I deliberately kept it switched off I knew you'd call me every 2 minutes. Harman, don't eat the stuff outside Make sure you drink only mineral water. And wear warm-clothes when you step out As if I'm still a baby! - You were enjoying the trip... and she was dying out of anxiety. - But why would you worry? You were singing away, twirling your moustache! Don't you poke fun at my moustache! - Oh no, Mama... I can't imagine my Papa without his moustache! All right. Sit down. I'll quickly get some tea and hot pakodas for you! Make sure they're Punjabi pakodas. Not the steamed Gujarati dhoklas I'm sorry, but... - Sorry? Don't you dare say a word against my dhoklas! Else, I'll take off on your whiskers! Papa, stop teasing Mama like this. - This is not teasing, my child It's only fun. Mischief like this is the spice of life Now that you are here, the cheer has returned to our house too How is it when I go away? - When you go away... the fun goes out of our lives.Life becomes mundane and meaningless Like the Gujarati dhokla? - Exactly.Like the Gujarati dhokla! Make sure you say that to your Ma. - There you go again, Papa That reminds me! I've written a poem on moustache. Listen. The twirl of my moustache... Now where is she...? My darling doll! Hey bro... you're up and ready so early in the day? I've been dressed for a long time. - Without a dash of opiate...? I feel the ecstasy without the opiate nowadays Really? And what could have brought about this miracle? That's not for you to understand. - Really, sir...? That's great. But I don't think you'll have any tea Bro, something surely is fishy. Earlier, no one wanted to wake up And now, everybody's dressed and rarin' to go... what say? Bro, you appear dressed and ready to leave, too! Ginda, when one falls in love. one loses his sleep and peace You too...? How am I going to explain? You won't understand Tell me something. Is love something that happens only to the educated? Can't the poor like us fall in love? Looks like you've been badly jilted Not at all, sir. Mine is a simple story It's just that her father wouldn't agree I left the village. But know something, bro...? When you fall in love with someone the world appears to be like the heavens But when one fails in love... the agony a man goes through is something only he can understand You have taken away my soul... I bear the burden of this body, sweetheart How're you doing, Pammi? Up early in the morning? Have you quit the vice? - You're right Ever since I've returned from Manali, I just don't feel like it When love goes to your head, you don't need any other intoxication He's fallen for someone too. - Really...? In that case, talk it over with her. - Easier said than done I find myself tongue-tied. Why don't you try doing it? Forget talking, I reach for her hand. Don't tell me! Let's see you grabbing her hand now Look at them waiting for us Hi Sukhi... I've prepared the notes you asked for Well? What happened? - A current ran through me You were full of advise for me. So why didn't you reach for her hand? Pammi, look after me, please! I'm terribly scared of that girl So you now know how it is? - Sure, I do. Tough job, I say You're acting like a total stranger. Such haste...? Class is about to begin. And I'm already late I've got to attend class, too. Why don't we sit here for a while? I've got to meet the professor for a project... I've even forgotten the names of the flowers. Do you remember them? I remember just one name Which one? Harman Wow! This is amazing, isn't it? It now looks like a class in Punjab University's Chandigarh all right! It was so different earlier. Girls and boys on either side... it hardly looked like a class. It looked like a religious discourse! The change is thanks to our visit to Kullu Had we not gone to Kullu, all this would never have happened Sit down quietly, will you? Don't start lecturing us Now listen,you from Bhatinda..it's not for you to understand all this Because there happens to be a mystery behind all of this Now that you're here, take over the class, Mini My responsibility is over. I think you ought to teach them today No, it's not for me to teach. I'll keep learning all my life Now for the flowers you folks saw in Kullu... do you have a detailed report ready on them, or don't you? If you need any help, I'm here to assist you Also tell me what else you found appealing in Kullu Can't say about other things, Ma'am. But the gol-gappas were surely delicious! What are you hanging around for? Go and sit down Oh sure... I was about to sit down The samosas at the university and the rice and beans at the hostel... once you've tasted them, you can't forget them all your lives As if one can ever forget the beautiful girls around? If it wasn't for the girls, the University would be a barren land Rangeela has been around for years. He's just not prepared to leave! It's going to be written in my will After I'm dead, I want a memorial built for me here at the University So you want to turn into a ghost and scare the boys? Moron! Will I still cling to boys even when I'm a ghost? Why wouldn't I cling to the lovely girls around... what say? Aren't you ashamed to ogle at our girls? I mean, I'll just give them a look Because there's only one girl I really want to cling to Dolly, I hope you're coming to the music shop? Be there. Exactly at six What time did she say? - Six! See all the Romeos around, Harman? They have come! Pammi bro! Things have clicked! No touching! I feel a current! - What have I done? How can I help it if you feel a current running through you? Be careful. My Uncle might catch me at it Why're you afraid? Your uncle's in the village, not here You don't know! My uncle even appears in my dreams to twist my arm! What a useless guy! You have no hopes! God save me from her! Another gift from me Remember the gift I earlier gave you? Did you like it? I forgot to open it... what was it actually? I'm going to my village tomorrow So go ahead. Why must you tell me? I didn't want you to go around looking for me Bravo! Keep it up! Bravo... go for him! Not your back to the ground! Careful! Come here, come If you want to be a champion wrestler ... like Parminder Singh Dhoomchedi... you'll have to put in a lot of hard work, okay? Go on. Take his blessings Parminder, if even one boy of my village turns out to be like you... I'll think my effort has borne fruit. That's all I want Here comes another city-boy... Come, come Greetings dad This is my young lad Listen boys. We can't defeat these city-boy with our brains But with good health, we can always hold them to the ground. And good health is something you either find in the army... or in Punjab's villages Haven't you seen our army chief? What a great personality Go on now and get to work. Not your back to the ground, remember I'll be back in a moment The real fun of life lies in the villages, young man You get the best of milk to drink, enjoy the open fresh air... you'll find that only in the villages. All you have in the cities is noise The air is polluted, the food is adulterated... that's no life, is it? That's exactly why I decided after retiring from the army... that I would live in the village. You understand my point? Harnek...how often have I told you... to keep the filth out of the village? They just won't listen I'm an ex-soldier, after all I've decided to make my village a model place to live in So how are your studies coming along? Very well. I'm working hard Looks like you've taken a liking to the city This is your first visit home in two months. You get what I'm saying? Jeeti, my child... look, your brother has found time for us at last Sat Sri Akal, brother! - Sat Sri Akal How're you doing, Jeetu? - I've told you so often.I'm Jeeti And where's my MP3 player? - Oh, I totally forgot about that You always forget, brother! I asked you for such a small gift! A gift is meant for special occasions. Like when is your birthday? Whenever my birthday is, I want that MP3 player right now. That's it! Look, daddy. Brother doesn't love me at all! Why do you keep fighting? Jeeti, my child... you'll know what it means... only after you two are married are separated You'll keep missing each other. - All right... I'll bring it the next time I come. Happy? Happy? But I'm always happy! Let me go and tell mother! Biji... (Biji=mother) Guess who's here? - Who? Brother's here! Over there! My respects. So you finally think of your mother? I always think of you. But I can't say about you I've been thinking of you since this morning Why? Something special? There's a wonderful proposal for you They've sent the girl's photo. May we give our consent to the alliance? Why ask him? If we think the alliance is all right, we'll go ahead with it But we must have his opinion? - Missus, his job is to study Which girl he gets to married to is our look-out Think of that mustard-leaves dish - I made it right in the morning I knew my son was coming today. That's the standard diet of Punjab It's like a tonic for the Jatts! Give the boy some fresh milk first. It'll set his digestion right I'll visit the Village Council and return soon Bro, I'll go and fetch that photo. No... I don't want to see any photo What's all this about photos! With a handsome son like you... we are bound to receive proposals, aren't we? Here you are, bro! Take a look! - I don't want to Take a look with at least one eye. - I told you, I didn't want to Why flare up? Don't take a look. What am I going to lose anyway? What rotten girl is that...? - Rotten girl! You're going to beg me to do something for you... with this rotten girl! Beg you? Me? - Yes Don't start kidding yourself. - Really? Think it over It's your little sis who's going to help Really? Just wait and see I'm going to get you married to a real ugly freak! Ugly freak...? Wait there! Careful... you may get hurt! Well? What do you keep thinking about me? You dream of making me your sweetheart? Now tell me something. Who do you think you are? I'm going to my village. Don't start missing me What arrogance! Miss you? My foot! What do you mean to me anyway? Don't rub it so vigorously, the paint will peel off Brother... Don't forget to take this What will I do with just this much? My friends will eat it up And why put it in that box? Nice clown I'll look carrying it Well said, young man! You're ashamed to carry two tiny boxes? When I was in college... I used to park the tractor right by my classroom! You could easily tell a real Sardarji was around Take it. It's made of clarified butter. No, it's okay... You'll find it only in the villages. The city has nothing to offer Bottles of aerated water! What else? No, I'm going to put on weight. Don't you exercise every morning? I do. - You do? So eat well! Eat well and be merry. Take a look at your Ma! Take it... it'll remind you of your mother when you eat it It'd remind me if I had forgotten you. How about me, bro? Will I have to remember you too? All right, I'll give it a thought Look at him, dad. - So long, folks See you... bye bye! He hasn't taken it, has he? Never mind, we'll eat it up These boys are such devils! They always keep asking me about the gol-gappas! I'm not going to forgive you! With those go|-gappas,you've given me a bad name in the whole class C'mon, Mini! C'mon! You mustn't care for what they say Tongues are bound to wag! Actually, they're jealous of us Now listen to me. I can't tolerate it when Deep keeps throwing smiles at you Now... what are you getting at? It's like this, Mini. If a girl keeps smiling provocatively at me... you won't be able to tolerate it either. Right? You and I are now one, you see. - Rangeela... you and I became one... just because we've shared some gol-gappas together? You were earlier my class-fellow. And now you are my student We share no other relationship. Do you understand? And don't you dare follow me! - Mini... These boys are going to ruin everything for me The cookie crumbles...? - How about some more gol-gappas? For God's sake! Stop following me, you devils! Just when things are working out, you guys ruin the whole show! Don't be serious. Come, let's have some tea I'd like a cup of tea all right. I'll perhaps have a sandwich too Did you call out to me...? - Me? No, I didn't What's up? Won't you throw a "hello" at me today? Why must it always be me who takes the initiative? If someone else took the initiative, I'd think about it Okay, I'll take the initiative today. Hello What good is a "hello" from so far? Come closer You could make it sound more loveable I also have a name God! I'm killed! Sorry, I must leave.I'll be blamed if something happens to you Hey... where to? Won't you cure the dying? What will I have to do...? Could you tell me? Ever since I've bought this bike, I ride it all on my own It keeps taunting me... that I don't have someone to ride pillion with me Really? Yours is indeed a very nasty mobike What'|| happen if it runs away with me? But I'm with you... don't you trust me? May I sit on it then? Think twice before you do that Once you sit on it, you become mine How am I going to spend this night? Hey guys! Harman's mine! O great maestros... your songs had inspired me to become a singer But destiny willed otherwise; I became a servant in the mess The whole world listens to your songs... as for my songs, it's the boys in the hostel who hear me sing But let me tell you one thing. The day these guys approve of me... my photo's going to figure right there with yours! Don't mind that... I'll paste mine a bit lower than yours! Grant me your leave now. The boys must be waiting for me I'll treat them to some tea and also ask about their well-being The games destiny plays... where have I landed...? What had poor me done? I don't like it when I'm all alone... What on earth can I do, if you don't like it when you're alone? Come to me Not at this hour. Only during the day One somehow spends the day. Nights are difficult to pass It just won't pass Don't say such things to me. Else, I'll hang up on you Okay, let's talk about something else. You tell me I don't like it when I'm all alone... Who were you talking to? - It was my friend... Honey When the daughter grows up, her best friend is her mother Should you hide something from your mother... you'll regret it all your life What's this name? - Navdeep Singh What does his father do? - He's a retired army Major Mama, Deep is a very nice boy. I'm sure you'll like him too It hasn't to do only with my liking him Your Papa's got to approve of him too. Papa will also like him Papa has given me every happiness in life He has never refused me anything. In Deep's case...? I don't know My child, I've spent 25 years amongst the Punjabis No doubt, they are very large-hearted But at the same time, they have extremely bloated egoes They can lay down their lives for their daughters... they can lay every happiness in the world at their feet... but there's one decision that they keep to themselves The daughters cannot get married of their own free will Harman, can I meet him? Yes, Mama. You're really going to like him! In that case, bring him home on some pretext or the other All right. I'll bring him home tomorrow itself What's wrong? - It won't start Is it sulking...? It always takes time. Can't be helped Want me to try? - No, I know it won't start up And I had to get home soon. - Let me drop you then Don't embarrass me by requesting. You ought to command me Can't start commanding just yet... What was that? - Nothing! May your jeep never start up! What was that? - Nothing My bike sometimes wobbles. So hold on tightly to me Tighter... tighter still! May I leave now? - No, dad and mom are out there Let me introduce you to them. - I think I must leave Come on! Hello, son. - Hello My jeep broke down. So he's come to drop me Take a seat, son. - No, I got to leave Have some tea? - No thanks, maybe some other day Shall I leave? Good day. Bye. See you in the college tomorrow Why did that guy with goggles come to drop Harman? Didn't she tell you? Her jeep had stalled She could've taken an autorickshaw. - Hey! Don't be funny Our daughter studies at the university. She spends the whole day with boys She even went on a picnic with them recently So what difference does it make if a boy comes to drop her home? I don't like it. Today he drops her home, tomorrow he'll be here for lunch He'll soon take her out to the movies. What then? Don't you trust your daughter? And what's wrong even if the two of them go to the movies? Are you out of your mind? I'm known all over Chandigarh How can anyone take my daughter to the movies? You've forgotten your early days? You used to take me around Ahmedabad all day on your mobike We even used to go to the movies. - It was different with us How's it different with them? - You haven't gone mad, have you? I don't like such jokes! Remember, we even got married Maybe they'll get married too? Married? Are you mad? I told you, I don't like such jokes! No boy steps in this house without my consent... let Harman know that! God! How you Punjabis blow things out of proportion! Harman's still doing her studies, the skies are not about to fall! Finish your tea. It's getting cold And also cool your brains How will I cool my brains? I realise today that the daughter I thought was a child,has grown up I must have a word with Brigadier Sahni. His son is a doctor in America Listen, I mustn't see that boy in the goggles in my house again! This is terrible, Mama. - What? I've never seen Papa in such a rage You won't understand, my child. But not to worry... I'll sort it out with your Papa. Okay? I must tell you, my child. I really liked Deep But no promises... the final decision will be taken by your daddy himself Don't be funny! The brigadier's son is settled in America She's going to be happy with him! - How's she going to be happy? Neither does the boy know her well, nor does Harman know him Isn't it enough that I know him well? We know the suitor's parents. Not the suitor himself For all you know, he might be in love with someone else He lives in America, after all. It's Harman who's going to get married So we must ask her what her choice is, isn't it? Harman's still a kid! What would she know about the world? Anyone could mislead her! It's I who will decide about her marriage God Almighty! We haven't even met the boy, nor his parents... and our mind is already made up! Let's meet his folks first If we like them, we'll get them married... or we'll turn down the proposal. There's nothing wrong with that, is there? And you have already seen the boy. The one who came to drop her home? That guy on the mobike? Who wore goggles? Yes, he's the one If I would have known that I would have shot him. Control yourself, Colonel You can't use force on the new generation We can calmly discuss whatever there is to talk about But let me make one thing clear We can't decide Harman's future without hearing her opinion Harman, come here You are our only child. We have no one but you We live only for you As your father, I want you to have every happiness in life But decisions in life aren't so easy to make That chap who came yesterday, what's his name...? Pardon me...? Navdeep. - Navdeep.What does his father do? He now lives in the village. He retired as a Major from the army Oh! So he's a junior in rank. And what's his name? I haven't asked. I'm sorry, Papa It's okay. Ask Navdeep's father to come and see me May I go now? - Goon One moment... sorry guys. - I'll be back What's up?Where are you taking me? - C'mon! Say something, will you? What reward will you give me if I give you some wonderful news? That depends on how good the news is. Think again... don't refuse me later I wasn't born to go back on my word. Tell me now... what is it? When was I leaving this morning, to come to the college... my Papa said... - What? Ask Deep's dad to come and see me Why does he need to meet my daddy? - What? Is that what you wanted to tell me? - Yes And I wondered what was so great! - What do you mean...? Well... never mind! - Hey listen... I was only joking... This is not something to joke about I just wanted to see how pretty you'd look when you are crying You look even prettier A wider smile... There you are. Your problems have ended. And mine have begun How come? Who'll take your dad's word to mine? You will! Who else? - You don't know my daddy He starts talking only later. He delivers a slap first You're so scared of your dad? It's just that we have respect for our parents You could call it fear or... - I thought... only girls had a problem. But you boys, too...? What does that mean? - All right, think it over The guy in America is always there for me Why're you bent on killing me? I'm on my way, okay? My reward...? I owe it to you Here I come again! - Sat Sri Akal, bro What's up, bro? You're visiting us for the second time in a week Have you started missing us so much? It occurred to me to come and give you your birthday gift You came specially to give me my birthday gift? What else? - That's impossible Besides, my birthday's still two months away As if I can't give you the gift in advance Here you are. The latest MP3 player Here you are. Headphones too. - I can't believe this! You've got it all for me? You've liked it, right? - Very much So come here You've got your gift. Now there is something you'll have to do for me Brother, is this a gift or a bribe? There! Give her a gift and listen to her taunts! Can't you do a little thing for me? Don't you want that...? Oh yes... I want it! So what do you want me to do? The thing is, there's this girl who studies in my college... I know, a lot of girls study there... Hear me out first. Don't interrupt I told about a girl, Harman...? - Oh yes, yes! She and I are pretty... you know what I mean? Sure, I know what you mean. I obviously can't discuss it with daddy You know how it is So why don't you broach the subject with him? With daddy...? L...? - Right Keep this MP3 for yourself. I don't want a thrashing from dad! At least listen to me! Why get worked up for no reason? Take it... Go on If you don't help your brother out, who will? My God! Poor little boy, aren't you? Please, sis... no one except you can pull it off for me How...? Know what? I'll go and mention it to mother... she'll then talk it over with daddy! Amazing! My sister's such a wise girl? Come, let's go. - You go ahead. I'll join you soon Come with me. - Go on, I say! Biji... there's a problem. - What problem? Biji, how will you spend your time after I'm married and gone? I'll bring a bride for your brother. So get on with it! Your marriage, or your brother's? - Brother's, of course! But we need to find a girl first. - I have, Biji You have...? Who is she? - She... Jungi, go and finish the work inside She studies in brother's college. - Really? But he never told me But of course, Biji! He feels shy! He's waiting out there Waiting outside? You didn't tell me he had come home!I You didn't tell me you've arrived? - My respects, Biji Bless you. What's Jeeti saying? - What? About this girl who studies with you... With me? A load of nonsense! What lies! What were you telling me out there? Biji, this is what he has come here to tell you! Stop fighting. Let me ask him. Who's this girl...? She's studying with him. - I didn't ask you, did I? What's her name? - Harman Oh, Biji! He's not going to tell you anything! Better ask me! She's in the same class as him, her name is Harman... he wants to marry her, but is scared to tell daddy... which is why I've got to do all this Can't you just keep quiet? Who are the girl's folks son? Her father was in the army too. A colonel, actually He wants dad to go and see him But the problem is, who's going to tell daddy? And guess what, Biji? To let you into all this... I've been bribed with an MP3 player! I'll fix you later, okay?? You could've got something for me too It's only the mother who'll do everything for free It's only the mother who never needs an inducement Be careful how you go about it, Biji. The task is fraught with danger I'd do it a hundred times over for a son like him Don't worry, son. I'll have a word with your Papa Missus, I have good news A college has been approved for the village. So sweeten my tongue Here you are You know why Navdeep has come home? Must've come home for more money. Just give it to him. No, he wants to discuss something else with you So why doesn't he? - He's scared of you Why should he be scared of me...? - No, actually, he's feeling shy Shy? What is it that makes him feel shy? Actually, there's this girl who studies with him She's the one he wants to talk to you about He wants to talk to me about a girl who studies with him...? Where is he? I'll talk to him Hear me out first, will you? Later! Call him here! Where is he? Why're you angry with the poor boy? - Angry? You've spoilt your son! Deep... Deep... Don't be angry... he'll come soon Won't you even hear me out first? - Don't you irritate me! Calm down... don't bring the village here with your temper This guy has grown too big for his boots... where is he? He's out there, sir Come here!I What am I hearing? What girl do you want to talk to me about? No, I haven't said anything like that. So who told you? It's Jeeti who told me. - Jeeti... I haven't said a word, daddy. I don't know anything Now listen carefully to me I must never hear of such a thing ever again Else, I'll have you brought back to the village... and seat you on a tractor Out romancing already! His studies still aren't over, he's not fit to earn a penny... and he's already chasing girls. Behave yourself! Jungi! Get my car! You just fly off the handle. You must at least hear him out? I was the one who liked the proposal. You did? So you could've said as much.Where was the need for him to say so? But what's wrong if he has expressed his opinion? He hasn't gone against you,has he? - That's okay... but he won't talk about his marriage. That's not his look-out! It's for us to see and decide about the bride's folks... whether they can get along with us or not He spoke because the girl's parents want her married off... to someone in America The girl told him to ask his folks to discuss it with her parents... or they'd marry her off abroad Let them marry her off to anyone! Our son is lacking in nothing? There are thousand of proposals! - Can't you be calm when you talk? The way you keep scolding the boy, it makes me very scared Must I let him have his way because he's in his teens? That's not happening! But he came to seek your permission What's her father doing? He's a retired colonel from the army Why didn't you tell me? - When do you ever listen? I only have to start a conversation. And you walk out in a huff! You've spent so many years with me. Don't you still know... how to explain things to a soldier. And especially to a Jatt, at that? I've never been able to understand you! You keep changing tunes at the drop of a hat! You're no less! Sitting with your face turned away.A Jatt, after all! Stop it, will you? You're rubbing away Not to worry, sir. I'll have it shining for you So long, Biji. - Bless you, son Look after yourself Listen... your mother was telling me that the girl's father... used to be a colonel? That's right. - What's his name? Well... Colonel Thakur Singh He was in your own ordnance And he now lives in...? - Chandigarh Ask him to come and see me Actually, he wanted you to go over and see him, daddy I see. He's a Colonel and I'm a Major But I'm the groom's father! If he wanted to talk to me, he ought to have come and seen me Why did he send you? Tell the Colonel... that if he wants to discuss the alliance, he'll have to... come here and talk it over with Major Balwinder Singh Brar It's not done for me to go there. We're the groom's parents, after all Absolutely. - You get my point? I do, daddy. Absolutely. So long, Biji. I must leave now Bye, daddy Concentrate on your studies. You must pass with a distinction Your father retired as a Major. You must retire as a General I'll do my best You're going away without the goodies again. Here you are If it wasn't for my darling sister, who'd look after me? Do call me when you reach the college So long Well, missus? Are you happy with the soldier now? Tell me what happened...? Is everything okay? My heart is sinking! Hurry up and tell me, please! You almost killed me! What happened? What else? I told my sis, she told my mom and my mom told my father He was initially very angry... but then I told him it's a Colonel's daughter He was suddenly quiet. You mean you discussed everything? Absolutely! As if I'd leave anything unsaid! My daddy has invited your dad home. - What...? What's what? Just a minor change in the programme My dad says the bride's folks must come and talk it over with us That's how it's done in the world. I'm the groom, after all You've landed me in tension again! How will I talk to Papa again? Think again If you want to marry me... so much of tension you must bear My heart is already thumping away wildly Really? May I check it out? Hey! Navdeep's father is right. We're the bride's parents, aren't we? We're the ones who must meet them. But I'm a Colonel, he's just a Major Must I go to his house? That too, in his village? Punjab's villages are no longer villages. Things have changed Maybe the villages have changed, but not the villagers They're still where they were! What are they saying...? That we're the bride's parents and they're groom's, right? But girls now are equal to boys. And my child's the best in the world! But what is wrong in going there? I don't want to listen to anything. That Major should come to my house! Tell him that if he wants an alliance, ... he'll have to come to my house Nice soup we've landed in My dad says Harman's parents must go and meet him Harman's dad says my parents must go and see him So what are we going to do? How do we make the two of them meet up? Strange fathers, I tell you! What do they hold against each other? They won't think about their children.. A silly ego-trip is all that matters! One says, Come to the village.' The other says, " Come to the city These guys are poles apart! This is exactly why you need a wise man... to accompany the groom's entourage If I went away, you guys wouldn't know whom to turn to! This issue is so complicated, only a wise man can find a way out Obviously, I'm the one who'll have to think of something Honestly, Rangeela... we have no respect for you But if you can really think of a way out... we'll forgive you for all the freeloading Here's what we'll do. Let's celebrate my birthday Skip the silly jokes!What has your birthday to do with their parents? You don't get it, do you? That what sets Rangeela apart from you At my birthday party, we'll invite Deep's parents... and also her mummy and daddy. Once they get together at my birthday party... aren't they going to hug each other? Haven't I solved the problem? You've won our hearts indeed! You're really a colourful guy I'll become a colourful guy when Mini accepts me There you go on about yourself again. First let us get through with it So... when are we holding the party? As they say, never delay a good thing Let's have the party this Sunday. Wow, Rangeela! You've been truly amazing You'll gradually discover what stuff I'm made of! Thanks, senior citizen. - Wow, Rangeela! We have this tradition that is always adhered to in the army Like, you must always respect your seniors In fact, Uncle, the whole of my family is full of army officers I see. Good, good Uncle, my Uncle handled the canon. - My God! Handled a canon? Actually, his uncle could carry a huge canon... on his shoulder and still run! On his shoulders...? That's very good! A strong man! His uncle still carries him on the shoulders... and runs through the fields! People in the army are very strong In fact, you must join the army. You'll make a good officer How can I join the army, sir? I could join the army only if I could leave the university The university's just for a couple of years... you'll have to leave it then? The thing is, I may want to be rid of the ailment... but the ailment won't leave me! I can't tell you what commitment I've gone and made! A commitment with an ailment...? My commitment is with my beautiful Gujarati wife... Geeta Rani Stop it! You act like a child when you're among the kids Darling, we're sitting with senior... I mean, we're with youngsters here! Actually, you look younger than all the boys here If you could only trim your moustache a bit... you'd look like a young boy! An attack on my moustache? An attack on Colonel Thakur Singh's whiskers? Who do you think I am? A silly imbecile...? You're talking such nonsense! Scared you out of your wits, didn't I? I know everything about you You're a permanent member at the Punjab University... for the last 10 years You've no chances of entering the army. Who was the canon-guy...? So your uncle carries a canon on his shoulders and marches ahead? Have you even seen a real canon? You think I'd fall for any crap? This is the first time we've shared a joke with a soldier Don't ever poke fun at a soldier. Especially me But you are all nice people, that's not what I was saying! Nice place. Whose hotel is it? - It's a golf course, actually I see. It must spread over at least 10 to 12 acres. Very good Sat Sri Akal... - Sat Sri Akal We aren't late. Are we, son? - No, it's okay Well, whose birthday is it? - It's his T see... Daddy, this is Colonel Thakur So he is your father? Yes A very third-class father! Mind your tongue! I haven't still forgotten your class You'll tell me what my class is, you village bumpkin? What are you doing, Papa? - Quiet! Is she your daughter? - You doubt that? I actually did. But not anymore You knew about me, so you didn't come to my house... to seek an alliance You've got it... exactly why you wanted me to come to your house to seek an alliance? So that you could humiliate me in your house? Shame on you! You want to link your son's name with my daughter's and defame me? Keep your daughter under control. Don't you dare point a finger at her! Cut the nonsense! Else, you're going to get killed! Your true colours at last! What else do you know except bloodshed? Take him away, else there'll be mayhem! As if I'm scared of you! Papa, please... Why create a farce in public...? - What farce! Must I run away scared of him? - That's enough, Papa Enough... let's go Forget college, he didn't stop following me even in the army! But he used to irritate me. Call me an uncouth village bum! I once took him by his neck and threw him to the ground! He promptly reported me to the officer in-charge He was married to the officer's sister He had my performance report tampered with... and had my promotion stalled! He himself went on to become a Colonel, but he returned... to mentally torture me so much... I had to take a premature retirement He has sabotaged my... I can never forgive him! It's because of him that I didn't get a medal for meritorious service He used to always complain about me to the rest of the officers Because he wasn't promoted to a Colonel's rank... he held me responsible for it! And look at my misfortune! Even in college, he used to study with me! Guess what he brought his stuff on to the college? On a tractor! A tractor really! He used to despise those in the city because I could speak English and he couldn't! You've really escaped, my child! He'd have turned your life into hell! This man's name is not going to be brought up in his house ever again! Have I made my point clear? Good! I escaped from the Colonel and came to this village And even here...he wants to ruin my family life too? He has set his daughter after my son! Now listen to me carefully, Deep As long as I live, that Colonel's daughter is not coming... to this family! Fortunate are the boys and girls who get married... not out of their parents' choice, but of their own We're at a point in life where one wrong decision on our part... can ruin our lives You are as old as we are What would you have done, had you been in our shoes? Deep, may I ask you something? Do you think you have done something wrong? No How about you, Harman? - Not at all It's clear then. When we have done nothing wrong... why should we be scared of our parents? I suggest you take a decision and go and tell your parents about it Whether they like it or not, is their look out They are not going to agree. So tell them that you've decided... that you want to live together - I don't know about Deep... but my Papa's going to shoot me, the moment he hears that This is the limit! Why should our parents be controlling our lives? Look at the progress the world has made... but our parents are still living in a time-warp! It's said that the present generation... enjoys a lot of freedom That boys and girls study together in the colleges They can eat what they want to and wear anything they fancy What else do we want...? But when it comes to real freedom... they're out to strangle us! - You're right! Choosing a life-companion is the most important decision. Isn't it? But we have no say in the matter! Take my advise. The two of you must run away from home No need to do anything drastic like that If you want to be happy, go and get married in a court We'll deal with whatever happens later. That's exactly what I want to know What's going to happen later? Let them not agree! The two of you can live separately It's so easy to tell someone to separate from his parents Have you ever considered what will happen of our lives... if we are separated from them? To run away from home... to get married in court against our parents' consent... is a problem, it's no solution! Has anyone who has run away from home, ever been happy? Think of what our lives will be, without our parents Answer me. Why are you quiet? Not only will be deprived of their love... where are we also going to live? How will we continue our studies, forget about getting a job We'll have to start life all over again... can we do that? How many of you really can? Raise your hands Now give me an answer to this question Just how much do your parents love you? Lots Far more than I can describe They can do anything for us That's it. They can do anything for us They not only fulfill our needs... they're even prepared to die for us! Would anyone else in the world do so much for us? All I know is that our parents are our Gods Then why's all this happening? Why can't they understand our feelings? Why can't they see our plight, in a tussle of their egoes? Harman, imagine the times about 20 or 25 years ago... when our own parents must've got married Boys then used to express their love to girls... looking at them from a distance Our parents quietly got married... to the ones their parents wished them to So naturally, they want to subject us ... to whatever they have been through They haven't changed at all. It's we who have changed very rapidly But they must change with the times too. Mustn't they? That's just what we've got to understand They can't change so quickly So what on earth can we do? We must try and understand them A Punjabi can tolerate anything But he can never tolerate a blemish on his fair name In his sisters and daughters lies his reputation One wrong step on his daughter's part... can cast a stigma on his reputation So will we never have the right to choose our life-partners? We will. Why won't we? But before that, we must win their confidence The day they are convinced that we will not take a wrong step... half the job will be done. - How about the other half? Should we be true of heart and true in love... we will win over their hearts. - But how will that happen? It will, Harman. It surely will Trust me Just wait and watch Listen... it's days since Deep has arrived. Why isn't he going back to the university? I told him, but he said that a few days is not going to do any harm I see Call him here. I'll ask him... - Now don't start scolding him He's a young man now. Young man! But he's our son, isn't he? I must at least ask him what's happening How will he manage without attending classes... for such a long time? Deep... - Yes, daddy? Come up here. - Coming Yes, daddy? Do you have holidays in the college? No So why aren't you attending? Well, I don't want to study, daddy What did you say? - I'll have to go to the city... and meet people you don't like And where do I have to study and hunt for a job? I'll handle our work here... and also take the other ventures you've begun, towards success The next time I go... I'll even bring my luggage back from the hostel, daddy Now look, young man. Don't say such a thing ever again It's good that you want to live and work here in the village But the time for you to do that hasn't still arrived Your father is still alive I don't want to hear you talking about... bringing back your luggage again It's necessary to study, it's necessary to find jobs... or else, you'll roam around the village... like an illiterate vagabond! Prepare to leave tomorrow morning. But Papa... - No nonsense! All right, I'll have to go, since you're asking me to But can I stay on for a few more days? Where's Harman? - In her room Has she had any tea? - She's even had her breakfast What did she say? - What could she say? I mean, did she talk about that boy? No Did she say anything about me? - What are you talking about? What's gotten into you? - Keep an eye on her She's got to come straight home immediately after her class is over All right. Also keep an eye on the telephone We ought to know who our daughter is talking to! You're drinking a lot of tea. Is that your first cup? First. - The third Papa, the more tea you have, the more spoonfuls of sugar too And you'll say you're not feeling well. But I'm absolutely all right! - Not right at all! He was up at five and has been following me ever since I said I'm absolutely all right! Come home as soon as your class is over I'll come home as soon as class is over And I'll fry some cauliflower-pakodas for you No way! He's become so fat! No fried stuff for him! Who says my Papa is fat? There can be no one like my Papa in the whole world Am I right, Papa? What was that she said? - Didn't you hear it? That you are the best father in the world And why did she say that? - What do you mean? Aren't you a good father? Has he spoken to you about something? About what? Well... about that girl? He didn't say anything to me, but I asked him And what did he say? - He said, "Forget it, Ma" "I will never do something that makes daddy unhappy" He has even told the girl that he won't talk to her... because his parents don't approve I've made an early-morning round of the fields Daddy, much against my wishes... I think I'll have to visit Chandigarh My friends have organised a function... and you'll have to accompany me too What will I do there? I don't like such functions in any case... in which they have strange western dance steps for Punjabi folk songs They said that I need not come at all... if I don't bring my daddy along I keep telling them about you, you see I've already promised them, daddy What's the big deal? If daddy does not keep his son's promise, who will? Of course I'll go with you. In fact... Missus, I'm taking you along too I'll pay a visit to the Village Council too, okay? This boy hasn't taken after me. - What makes you say that? He shows no trace of anger! He does everything he's told to... he doesn't have a temper at all! - I can't figure out... whether you're praising him, or are beginning to suspect him! Why would I suspect him? But yes... this boy has won over my heart He makes my heart swell with pride What's this? - Potato-pancakes You love them, don't you? So I made some for you If my daughter has made it, it has to be something special! No false-praise. Taste it first Okay! Wow! Wow! This is the first time I've had a genuine pancake! Your mother keeps feeding me Gujarati theplas! You're too much, Papa! You could occasionally praise Mama too This is all right! When I start praising her... she thinks I'm actually unwell! I must leave now, Papa. I'm late. - Come back soon, my child When you leave, you take away the joy of the family How is it when I come back? When you come back... the joys of the family are restored to us Papa, our department is organising a programme I'd be very happy if you could attend Are you inviting me? - Yes, sir Then I'll surely attend What could be dearer to me than your happiness? Hey beautiful wife! Listen! - What? Harman has made these delicious pancakes for me Wow! - And listen to this We've got to attend a function her department has organised No way! What will I do there? I'd rather you go alone That's not done! Can't you do even this much for our daughter's happiness? You're going with me. And that's an order! There you are! All I've done in my life is to obey your orders I'll obey this one, too! Okay? Had it not been for the huge change in my dad... I don't think he'd have agreed to attend the programme so easily For days, we've been trying to convince them... that we're not any different from them And that's the truth too We can never do anything without their consent What if they still refuse to be placated? It's a decision we have already taken. We can't back out now What needs to seen is how long our parents take... to look at things from our perspective We've either already made a place in their hearts... or after the programme... they'll have to think of us And if that is still not possible? We'll live by ourselves then. All our lives We'll always make them feel... that we could never be married because of them We have no other choice We have no otehr choice Welcome, Colonel... welcome! Please come, sir... - No jokes today, I hope? Oh no, not at all! No jokes! We're actually going to show you a programme today... that you will remember all your life. Really? That's very good Hurry up, will you missus? Please sit down, Uncle.Those seats are specially reserved for you! Sat Sri Akal, Uncle. Sat Sri Akal, Aunt... Please be seated... please sit down! Please sit down, Uncle. Please sit, Aunt. We present to you the present day Heer and Ranjha... the legendary lovers This show... this show isn't just a show. It's a cry from our hearts We had some questions to ask And there was something we wanted to tell our parents... who sit in front of us right now I request them to please take the stage... and answer our questions Please, daddy Go ahead and speak No. You speak first Why? You're scared to speak your heart? As if you're not scared? I accept this here in public today... that the Balwinder Singh Brar who stands here... is someone I don't like For the first ever time today... I feel scared to speak So you can say whatever needs to be said What can a father say when his daughter tells him... that the most important thing for her is her father's respect I'm ashamed of myself. It has been proved today... that even a father can take wrong decisions when it comes to his daughter Even a father can make mistakes I've made a mistake too I have cast aspersions on my daughter As for the legendary Heer, you are right, my child... although times have changed, Heer is still where she was Heer has always sacrificed herself for the happiness of her father So what fathers are they... that cannot think of their daughters' joys? I make a promise in the presence of you folks today... that I will never force any decision on my daughter My daughter will never be sent away forcibly as a bride I can realise it too I've always done what I thought was right I had forgotten that there were other members in my family... who had a right to express their opinion in every decision... that was taken For them, they never existed. All was well... so long as I could have my way Tell me something... what are you and I fighting over? I don't know What I do remember is that I lived in the city... and you lived in the village I could speak English and you couldn't Do you think so...? - Oh my God! English! Another question. How can you prove that it was because of me... that you didn't win recognition? - How can you prove... that you weren't promoted because of me? Neither did you have any proof, nor did I We just looked for excuses to get into fights How ironical! As part of the army, we kept fighting the enemy together But we couldn't get together for the sake of our children. Right? Major Brar, the children have done their duty But have we ever tried to understand them? To be honest, our children have beat us at the game Are we only going to talk or also do something? Now listen, children. If you are no different from us... we aren't different from you either What are we to do now? - We ought to Court Martial them! Amazing!Shooting off orders again! - We're not obeying your orders Why don't you make up first? - She's right We've been fighting all our lives. It's time to hug each other... Fix a date for the Court Martial! - Okay! Not at all! - What now? The two of you are taking the decisions again? Our mothers are around too. Why not take their opinion? We were about to make a mistake again Rather we leave the decision to them Now look... do please forgive me, if I've made a mistake Let's skip the apologies We're glad that you finally acknowledge our existence! We ought to have a say too. - Absolutely right I seek your daughter's hand in marriage to my son It's the bride's parents who seek an alliance. We're the groom's parents! Isn't it aptly said...? “It's always Springtime with the beloved!
