[Trumpet Fanfare] In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew but I must attend his majesty's command to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection. You shall find of the king a husband, madam, you, sir, a father. What hope is there of his majesty's amendment? He hath abandoned his physicians, madam, under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time. This young gentlewoman had a father. Oh, that had! How sad a passage 'tis! Whose skill was almost as great as his honesty, had it stretched so far, nature would have become immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the king's sake, that he were living! I think it would be the death of the king's disease. How called you the man you speak of, madam? He was famous in his profession, sir, and had great right to be so, Gerard de Narbon. Ah, he was excellent indeed, madam:. The king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly. He was likely to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality. What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of? A fistula, my lord. I heard not of it before. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon? His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises. Her dispositions she inherits, in her they are the better for their simpleness. She derives her honesty and achieves her goodness. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. Go to, Helena, no more, go to, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too. [Lafeu] How understand we that? Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living. [Countess] If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess of it soon make it mortal. [Betram] Madam, I desire your holy wishes. Be thou blessed, Bertram, and succeed thy father in manners, as in shape. Thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee and thy goodness share with thy birthright. Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy rather in power than use and keep thy friend under thy own life's key. Be chequed for silence, but never taxed for speech. What more heaven will, that thee may furnish and my prayers fall down, fall on thy head. Oh, Farewell. 'Tis an unseasoned courtier, good my lord, advise him. He cannot want the best that shall attend his love. [Countess] Heaven bless him. Farewell, Bertram. The best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you. Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, make much of her. [Lafeu] Farewell, pretty lady. You must hold the credit of your father. [piano plays] [Helena] Oh, were that all. I think not on my father, and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those I shed for him. What was he like? I have forgot him. My imagination carries no favor in it but Bertram's. I am undone. There is no living, none, if Bertram be away. It were all one that I should love a bright particular star and think to wed it. He is so above me. In his bright radiance and collateral light must I be comforted, not in his sphere. The ambition in my love thus plagues itself. The hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love. [piano plays] 'Twas pretty, though plague, to see him every hour, to sit and draw his arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, in our heart's table. Heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favor. But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his relics. [Helena voiceover] Who comes here? One that goes with him. I love him for his sake, and yet I know him a notorious liar, think him a great way fool, solely a coward. Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him that they take place when virtue's steely bones look bleak in the cold wind. With all, full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly. [out loud] Save you, fair queen. Are you meditating on virginity? Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you. Let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity, how may we barricado it against him? Keep him out. But he assails, and our virginity, though valiant in the defense, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance. There is none. Man sitting down before you will undermine you and blow you up. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up. [Parolles laughs] It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. I will stand for it a little, though therefore I die a virgin. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not. You cannot choose but loose by it. Out with it! Within ten year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with it! How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying. The longer kept, the less worth. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion. Richly suited, but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears. It looks ill, it eats drily. Marry, 'tis a withered pear, it was formerly better. Marry, yet 'tis a withered pear. Will you anything with it? Not my virginity yet. There shall your master have a thousand loves, a mother and a mistress, and a friend, a phoenix, captain, and an enemy, a guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, a counselor, a traitress, and a dear. His humble ambition, proud humility, his jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, his faith, his sweet disaster. With a world of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms that blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he... I know not what he shall. God send him well. The court's a learning place, and he is one... [Parolles] What one, in faith? That I wish well. 'Tis pity... [Parolles] What's pity? That wishing well had not a body in't which might be felt. That we, the poorer born, whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, might with effects of them follow our friends and show what we alone must think, which never return us thanks. [Page] Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you. Little Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star. Under Mars, I. I especially think, under Mars. Why, under Mars? The wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars. [Parolles] When he was predominant. When he was retrograde, I think, rather. Why think you so? [Helena] You go so much backward when you fight. That's for advantage. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety. But the composition that your valor and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well. I am so full of busy, so I cannot answer thee acutely. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers. When thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky gives us free scope. Only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull. What power is it which mounts my love so high, that makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye? The mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes and kiss like native things. Impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose what hath been cannot be. who ever strove to show her merit, that did miss her love? The king's disease. My project may deceive me, but my intents are fixed and will not leave me. The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears. Have fought with equal fortune and continue a braving war. So 'tis reported, sir. 'Tis most credible! We here received it, a certainty, vouched from our cousin Austria. Caution that the Florentine will move us for speedy aid, wherein our dearest friend prejudicates the business and would seem to have us make denial. His love and wisdom, approved so to your majesty, may plead for amplest credence. He hath armed our answer, and Florence is denied before he comes. Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see the Tuscan service, freely have they leave to stand on either part. It well may serve a nursery to our gentry, who are sick for breathing and exploit. What, what? What's he comes here? It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord. Young Bertram. [King] Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face. Frank nature, rather curious than in haste, hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts mayst thou inherit too. Welcome to Paris. My thanks and duty are your majesty's. [King groans] It much repairs me to talk of your good father. In his youth he had that wit which I can well observe today in our young lords. But they may jest till their own scorn return to them un-noted. Ere they can hide their levity in honor. Who were below him he used as creatures of another place and bowed his eminent top to their low ranks, making them proud by his humility. In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man might be a copy to these younger times, which, followed well, would demonstrate them now but goers backwards. His good remembrance, sir, lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb. So in a proof lives not his epitaph as in your royal speech. "Let me not live," quoth he, "after my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain. Whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments. Whose constancies expire before their fashions." This he wished. I, after him, do after him wish too, since I nor wax nor honey can bring home. I quickly were dissolved from my hive to give some laborers room. You are loved, sir, and they that least lend it you shall lack you first. I fill a place, I know it. How long is it, Count, since the physician at your father's died? He was much famed. Some six months since, my lord. If he were living, I would try him yet. Lend me an arm. The rest have worn me out with several applications. Nature and sickness debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count. My sons are no dearer. Thank your majesty. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe. It's my slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours. 'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow. [Countess] Well, sir. No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damned, but, if I may have your ladyship's good will to go to the world. Isbel, the woman and I, will do as we may. Wilt thou needs be a beggar? [Clown] I do beg your good will in this case. In what case? In Isbel's case, and mine own. Service is no heritage, and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue of my body. For they say barnes are blessings. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry. My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the flesh, and he must needs go that the devil drives. Is this all your worship's reason? Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they are. [Countess] May the world know them? I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are, and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent. His marriage, sooner than his wickedness. I am out of friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake. Such friends are thine enemies, sir. Get you gone, sir. I'll talk with you more anon. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you. Of her I am to speak. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her. Well, now. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely. Faith, I do. Her father bequeathed her to me, and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds. There is more owing to her than will be paid, and more shall be paid her than she'll demand. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wished me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears. She thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates. Love no god, that would not extend his might, only where qualities were level. This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in, which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you with all. Sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it. You have discharged this honestly. Keep it to yourself. Many likelihoods informed me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance I knew not whether believe or misdoubt. Stall tit in your bosom, and I thank you for your honest care. I'll talk with you more anon. Even so it was with me when I was young. If ever we are nature's, these are ours. This thorn is to our rose of youth rightly belong. Our blood to us, this to our blood is born. It is the show and seal of nature's truth, when love's strong passion is impressed in youth. From my remembrances of days foregone, such were our faults, or then we thought them none. Her eye is sick on't. I observe her now. What is your pleasure, madam? You know, Helen, I am a mother to you. [Helena] Mine honorable mistress. Nay, a mother. Why not a mother? When I said "a mother", me thought you saw a serpent. What's in mother, that you start at it? I say, I am your mother and put you in the catalog of those that were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen adoption strives with nature and choice breeds a native slip to us from foreign seeds. You ne'er oppressed me with a mother's groan yet I express to you a mother's care. [Countess laughs] God's mercy, maiden! Does it curd thy blood to say I am thy mother? Why, that you are my daughter? [Helena] That I am not. I say, I am your mother. Pardon, madam, the Count Rousillon cannot be my brother. I am from humble, he from honoured name. No note upon my parents, his all noble. My master, my dear lord he is, and I his servant live, and will his vassal die. He must not be my brother. [Countess] Nor I your mother? You are my mother, madam. would you were. So that my lord, your son, were not my brother, indeed my mother. Or were you both our mothers, I care no more for than I do for heaven, so I were not his sister. Can't no other, but, I your daughter, he must be my brother? Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law. God shield you mean it not. Daughter and mother so strive upon thy pulse. What, pale again? My fear hath catch'd your fondness. Now I see the mystery of your loneliness and find your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross. You love my son. Invention is ashamed against the proclamation of thy passion to say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true. But tell me then, 'tis so. For, look your cheeks confess it, the one to the other, and thine eyes see it so grossly shown in thy behaviors that in their kind they speak it. Only sin and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue, that truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so? If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew. If it be not, forswear it. Howe'er, I charge thee, as heaven shall work in me for thine avail to tell me truly. Good madam, pardon me. Do you love my son? [Helena] Your pardon, noble mistress. Love you my son? Do not you love him, madam? Go not about. My love hath in't a bond where of the world takes note. Come, come, disclose the state of your affection for your passions have to the full appeached. Then, I confess, here on my knee, before high heaven and you, that before you, and next unto high heaven, I love your son. My friends were poor, but honest, so's my love. Be not offended, for it hurts not him that he is loved of me. I follow him not by any token of presumptuous suit nor would I have him till I do deserve him. Yet never know how that desert should be. I know I love in vain, strive against hope. Yet in this captious and intenible sieve I still pour in the waters of my love and lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like, religious in mine error, I adore the sun, that looks upon his worshiper but knows of him no more. My dearest madam, let not your hate encounter with my love for loving where you do. But if yourself, whose aged honor cites a virtuous youth, did ever in so true a flame of liking wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian was both herself and love. Oh, then, give pity to her whose state is such that cannot choose but lend and give where she is sure to lose. That seeks not to find that her search implies, but riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies. Had you not lately an intent, speak truly, to go to Paris? Madam, I had. Wherefore, tell true. I will tell truth, by grace itself I swear. You know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and proved effects, such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty. Amongst the rest, there is a remedy, approved, set down, to cure the desperate languishings where of the king is rendered lost. And this was your motive for Paris, was it? Speak. My lord your son made me to think of this, else Paris and the medicine, and the king, had from the conversation of my thoughts haply been absent then. But think you, Helen, if you should tender your supposed aid, he would receive it? He and his physicians are of a mind. He, that they cannot help him, they, that they cannot help. How shall they credit a poor unlearned virgin, when the schools, emboweled of their doctrine, have left off the danger to itself? There's something in't, more than my father's skill, which was the greatest of his profession, that his good receipt shall for my legacy be sanctified by the luckiest stars in heaven, and, would your honor but give me leave to try success, I'd venture the well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure by such a day and hour. Dost thou believe it? Ay, madam, knowingly. Then, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love, means and attendants and my loving greetings to those of mine in court. I'll stay at home and pray God's blessing into your attempt. Be gone tomorrow and be sure of this, what I can help thee to thou shalt not miss. [King] Farewell, young lords. These warlike principles do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewell. Share the advice betwixt you. If both gain all the gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received, and is enough for both. 'Tis our hope, sir, after well entered soldiers, to return and find your grace in health. No, no, it cannot be. And yet my heart will not confess it owes the malady that doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords. Whether I live or die, be you the sons of worthy Frenchmen. Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty. [King groans] Those girls of Italy, take heed of them. They say, our French lack language to deny. If they... demand. Beware of being captives before you serve. [Both] Our hearts receive your warnings. [King groans] [First Lord] Farewell, my lord! Farewell! Oh, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us! 'Tis not his fault, the spark. Oh, 'tis brave wars. Most admirable, I have seen those wars. I am commanded here, and kept a coil with "too young" and "the next year" and "'tis too early." An thy mind stand to it, boy, steal away bravely. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock, creaking my shoes on the plain masonry, till honor be bought up and no sword worn, but one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away. There's honor in the theft. Commit it, Count. I am your accessary, and so, farewell. [both laugh] I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body. Farewell, captain. Sweet Monsieur Parolles! Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals. You shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek. It was this very sword entrenched it. Say to him, I live and observe his reports for me. We shall, noble captain. Mars dote on you for his novices! What will ye do? Stay the king. But, my good lord, 'tis thus, will you be cured of your infirmity? [groaning] No. Oh, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if my royal fox could reach them. I have seen a medicine that's able to breathe life into a stone, quicken a rock, and make you dance canary with spritely fire and motion. Whose simple touch, is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay, to give great Charlemain a pen in's hand and write to her a love-line. What 'her' is this? Why, Doctor She. My lord, there's one arrived, if you will see her. Now, by my faith and honor, if seriously I may convey my thoughts in this my light deliverance, I have spoke with one that, in her sex, her years, profession, wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her for that is her demand, and know her business? That done, laugh well at me. Now, good Lafeu, bring in the admiration that we with thee may spend our wonder too, or take off thine by wondering how thou took'st it. Nay, I'll fit you, and not be all day neither. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues. [King groans] This is his majesty. Say your mind to him. A traitor you do look like but such traitors his majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle, that dare leave two together. Fare you well. [King] Now, fair one, does your business follow us? Ay, my good lord. Gerard de Narbon was my father. In what he did profess, well found. I knew him. The rather will I spare my praises towards him. Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death many receipts he gave me, chiefly one, which, as the dearest issue of his practice, and of his old experience the only darling, he bade me store up, as a triple eye, safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so and hearing your high majesty is touched with that malignant cause wherein the honor of my dear father's gift stands chief in power, I come to tender it and my appliance with all bound humbleness. Me thank thee, maiden. But may not be so credulous of cure, when our most learned doctors leave us and the congregated college have concluded that laboring art can never ransom nature from her inaidible estate. I say we must not so stain our judgment and corrupt our hope to prostitute our past-cure malady to empirics, or to dissever so our great self and our credit, to esteem a senseless help when help past sense we deem. My duty then shall pay me for my pains. I will no more enforce mine office on you. Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts a modest one to bear me back again. I cannot give thee less, to be called grateful. Thou thought'st to help me and such thanks I give as one near death to those that wish him live. But what at full I know, thou knowest no part, I knowing all my peril, thou no art. What I can do can do no hurt to try, since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy. He that of greatest works is finisher oft does them by the weakest minister. So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown. When judges have been babes great floods have flown from simple sources, and great seas have dried when miracles have by the greatest been denied. Oft expectation fails and most oft there where most it promises, and oft it hits where hope is coldest and despair most fits. [King] I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid. Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid. Dear sir, to my endeavors give consent. Of heaven, not me, make an experiment. I am not an impostor that proclaim myself against the level of mine aim but know I think, and think I know most sure, my art is not past power, nor you past cure. Are thou so confident? Within what space hopest thou my cure? The greatest grace lending grace. Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring their fiery torcher his diurnal ring. Ere twice in murk and occidental damp, moist Hesperus hath quenched his sleepy lamp, or four and twenty times the pilot's glass hath told the thievish minutes how they pass. What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly, health shall live free and sickness freely die. Upon thy certainty and confidence what darest thou venture? Tax of impudence, a strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame traduced by odious ballads. My maiden's name seared otherwise. No, worse of worse extended with vilest torture let my life be ended. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak. His powerful sound within an organ weak. For what impossibility would slay in common sense, sense saves another way. Thy life is dear, for all that life can rate worth name of life in thee hath estimate, youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all that happiness and prime can happy call. Thou this to hazard needs must intimate skill infinite or monstrous desperate. Sweet practicer, thy physic I will try, that ministers thine own death if I die. If I break time, or flinch in property of what I spoke, un-pitied let me die, and well deserved. Not helping, death's my fee but, if I help, what do you promise me? Make thy demand. But will you make it even? Ay, by my scepter and my hopes of heaven. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand what husband in thy power I do command. Exempted be from me the arrogance to choose from forth the royal blood of France, my low and humble name to propagate with any branch or image of thy state. But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know is free for me to ask, thee to bestow. Here is my hand. The premises observed thy will by my performance shall be served. So make the choice of thy own time, for I, thy resolved patient, on thee still rely. More should I question thee, and more I must, though more to know could not be more to trust, from whence thou camest, who tended on, but rest unquestioned welcome and undoubted blessed. I shall now put you to the height of your breeding. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is but to the court. But to the court? Why, what place make you special, when you put off that with certain contempt? But to the court! Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners he may easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap, and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court. But for me, I have an answer will serve all men. Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions. From below your duke to beneath your constable. Here it is. Ask me if I am a courtier. It shall do you no harm to learn. To be young again, if we could. I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier? Oh, Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them. I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you. Oh, Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat. Oh, Lord, sir! Nay, put me to it, I warrant you. You were lately whipped, sir, as I think. Oh, Lord, sir! Spare not me. Do you cry, "Oh, Lord, sir" at your whipping, and "spare not me?" Indeed your "spare not me" is very sequent to your whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping and you were bound to it. I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my "O Lord, sir." I see, things may serve long, but not serve ever. I play the noble housewife with the time to entertain't so merrily with a fool. Oh, Lord, sir! Why, there't serves well again. An end to it. To your business. Give this to Helen and urge her to a present answer back. Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much. Not much commendation to them? Not much employment for you. Do you understand me? Most fruitfully. I am there before my legs. They say miracles are past, and we have our philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar, things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear. Why, it is the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out -in our latter times. -So it is. To be relinquished of the artists... So I say, both of Galen and Paracelsus. Of all the learned and authentic fellows... Right, so I say. that gave him out incurable... Why, there 'tis, so say I too. not to be helped... Right, as 'twere, a man assured of a... uncertain life, and sure death. Just, you say well, so would I have said. I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world. It is, indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall read it in, what do you call here? The showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor. That's it, I would have said the very same. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. For me, I speak in respect. Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the brief and the tedious of it, and he's of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the... The very hand of heaven. Ay, so I say. In a most weak... Weak and debile minister, great power, great transcendence, which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the king, as to be... Generally thankful. I would have said it, you say well. Here comes the king. [Lafeu] Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better, whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a coranto. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen? 'Fore God, I think so. Go, call before me all the lords in court. [orchestral music] Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side. With this healthful hand, whose banished sense thou hast repealed, a second time receive the confirmation of my promised gift, which but attends thy naming. [King laughs] Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing, of whom both sovereign power and father's voice I have to use. Thy frank election make. Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress fall, when love please. Marry, to each, but one. Peruse them well! Not one of those but had a noble father. Gentlemen, heaven hath through me restored the king to health. We understand it, and thank heaven for you. [applause] I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest, that I protest I simply am a maid. Please it your majesty, I have done already. The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me, "We blush that thou shouldst choose, but, be refused, let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever; we'll ne'er come there again." Make choice and see, who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me. [Helena voiceover] Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly, and to imperial Love, that God, most high, do my sighs stream. [Helena outloud] Sir, will you hear my suit? And grant it. Thanks, sir, all the rest is mute. The honor, sir, that flames in your fair eyes, before I speak, too threateningly replies. Love make your fortunes twenty times above her that so wishes and her humble love. No better, if you please. My wish receive, which great love grant, and so I take my leave. Be not afraid that I your hand should take. I'll never do you wrong for your own sake. Blessing upon your vows and in your bed find fairer fortune if you ever wed. [Lafeu] These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her. Sure, they are bastards to the English, the French ne'er got 'em. You are too young, too happy, and too good to make yourself a son out of my blood. Fair one, I think not so. [Lafeu] There's one grape yet. I am sure thy father drunk wine, but if thou best not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen. I have known thee already. I dare not say I take you, but I give me and my service, ever whilst I live, into your guiding power. This is the man. Why, then, young Bertram, take her. She's thy wife. My wife, my liege? I shall beseech your highness, in such a business give me leave to use the help of mine own eyes. Know'st thou not, Bertram, what she has done for me? Yes, my good lord, but never hope to know why I should marry her. Thou knowest she has raised me from my sickly bed. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down must answer for your raising? I know her well. She had her breeding at my father's charge. A poor physician's daughter, my wife? Disdain rather corrupt me ever! 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods, in colour, weight, and heat, poured all together, would quite confound distinction, yet stand off in differences so mighty. If she be all that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest, a poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest of virtue for the name. But do not so. From lowest place when virtuous things proceed, the place is dignified by the doer's deed. Where great additions swell's, and virtue none, it is a dropsied honor. Good alone is good without a name. Vileness is so. The property by what it is should go, not by the title. She is young, wise, fair. In these to nature she's immediate heir, and these breed honor. The mere word's a slave, deboshed on every tomb, on every grave a lying trophy, and as oft is dumb where dust and damned oblivion is the tomb of honoured bones indeed. What should be said? If thou canst like this creature as a maid, I can create the rest. Virtue and she is her own dower, honor and wealth from me. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do it. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose. That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad. Let the rest go. My honor is at the stake, which to defeat, I must produce my power. Here, take her hand, proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift. That dost in vile misprision shackle up my love and her desert. That can not dream. We, poising us in her defective scale, shall weigh thee to the beam. That shall not know it is in us to plant thine honor where we please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt. Obey our will, which travails in thy good. Believe not thy disdain but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims. Or I will throw thee from my care for ever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance. Both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee in the name of justice, without all terms of pity. Speak, thine answer. Pardon, my gracious lord, for I submit my fancy to your eyes. When I consider what great creation and what dole of honor flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now the praised of the king, who, so ennobled, is as 'twere... born so. Take her by the hand and tell her she is thine, to whom I promise a counterpoise, if not to thy estate, a balance more replete. I take her hand. [King] Good fortune and the favor of the king smile upon this contract whose ceremony shall seem expedient upon the now-born brief and be performed tonight. The solemn feast shall more attend upon the coming space expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her, thy love's to me religious. Else, does err. Thy lord and master did well to make his recantation. Recantation! My lord! My master! Ay, is it not a language I speak? A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My master! Are you companion to the Count Rousillon? To any count, to all counts, to what is man. To what is count's man, count's master is of another style. You are too old, sir, let it satisfy you, you are too old. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man, to which title age cannot bring thee. What I dare too well do, I dare not do. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow. Thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel. It might pass, yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee to be a vessel of too great burthen. I have now found thee. When I lose thee again, I care not. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee... Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial, which if, Lord have mercy on thee, for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well. Thy casement I need not open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity. With all my heart, and thou art worthy of it. I have not, my lord, deserved it. Yes, good faith, every dram of it, and I will not bate thee a scruple. Well, I shall be wiser. Even as soon as thou canst. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and beaten thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation! I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal. For doing, I am past. As I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave. [grunts angrily] Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me. Scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient. There is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would of... [giggles] I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again. Sirrah, your lord and master's married. There's news for you. You have a new mistress. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord, whom I serve above is my master. Who, God? Ay, sir. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms of this fashion? Dost make hose of sleeves? Do other servants so? [Parolles] [quietly] Servants... Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. Now, by mine honor, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat thee. Methinks, thou art a general offense and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord. Go to, you are a vagabond and no true traveler. You are more saucy with nobles and honorable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever! [Parolles] What's the matter, sweetheart? Although before the solemn priest I have sworn I will not bed her. What? what, sweetheart? Oh, my Parolles, they have married me. I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits the tread of a man's foot. To the wars! There's letters from my mother. What the import is, I know not yet. Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars! He wears his honor in a box unseen, that hugs his kicky-wicky here at home, spending his manly marrow in her arms, which should sustain the bound and high curvet of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions, France is a stable. We that dwell it jades. Therefore, to the war! It shall be so. I'll send her to my house, acquaint my mother with my hate to her, and whether I am fled. Write to the king that which I durst not speak. His present gift shall furnish me to those Italian fields where noble fellows strike. War is no strife to the dark house and the detested wife. Will this capriccio hold in thee? Art sure? I'll send her straight away. Tomorrow I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard. A young man married is a man that's marred. My mother greets me kindly. Is she well? She is not well, but yet she has her health. She's very merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she's very well and wants nothing in the world, but yet she is not well. If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's not very well? Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things. What two things? One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly. The other that she's in Earth, from whence God send her quickly! [Parolles] Bless you, my fortunate lady! I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes. You had my prayers to lead them on and to keep them on, have them still. Oh, my knave, how does my old lady? So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you say. Why, I say nothing. Marry, you are the wiser man. For many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title. Which is within a very little of nothing. Away, thou'rt a knave. You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a knave. That's, before me thou'rt a knave. This had been truth, sir. Go to, thou art a witty fool, I have found thee. Did you find me in yourself, sir? Or were you taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable, and much fool may you find in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of laughter. A good knave, in faith, and well fed. Madam, my lord will go away tonight. A very serious business calls on him. The great prerogative and rite of love, which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge, but puts it off to a compelled restraint. Whose want, and whose delay, is strewed with sweets which they distill now in the curbed time to make the coming hour o'erflow with joy and pleasure drown the brim. What's his will else? That you will take your instant leave of the king and make this haste as your own good proceeding, strengthened with what apology you think may make it probable need. What more commands he? That, having this obtained, you presently attend his further pleasure. In every thing I wait upon his will. I shall report it so. I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof. You have it from his own deliverance? And by other warranted testimony. Then my dial goes not true. I took this lark for a bunting. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge and accordingly valiant. Then I have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valor, and my state that way is dangerous when I cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes. I pray you, make us friends, I will pursue the amity. [Lafeu laughs] Pray you, sir, who's his tailor? Sir? Oh, I know him well, I, sir, he, sir, yes, very good workman, a very good tailor. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur? I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's displeasure. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord. And shall do so ever, though I took him at prayers. Believe this of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut. The soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in matter of heavy consequence. Farewell, monsieur. I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand but we must do good against evil. An idle lord, I swear. I think not so. Why, do you not know him? Yes, I do know him well. Common speech gives him a worthy pass. Has she gone to the king? She is. Will she away tonight? As you will have her. I have written my letters, casketed my treasure, given order for our horses, and tonight, when I should take possession of the bride, end ere I do begin. [Parolles laughs] Here comes my clog. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you, spoke with the king and have procured his leave for present parting. Only he desires some private speech with you. I shall obey his will. You must not marvel, Helen, at my course, which holds not color with the time, nor does the ministration and required office on my particular. Prepared I was not for such a business, therefore am I found so much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you that presently you take our way for home and rather muse than ask why I entreat you, for my respects are better than they seem and my appointments have in them a need greater than shows itself at the first view to you that know them not. This to my mother. 'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so, I leave you to your wisdom. Sir, I can nothing say but that I am your most obedient servant. Come, come, no more of that. And ever shall, with true observance, seek to eke out that wherein toward me my homely stars have failed to equal my great fortune. Let that go. My haste is very great. Farewell, hie home. Pray, sir, your pardon. Well, what would you say? I am not worthy of the wealth I owe, nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is. But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal what law does vouch mine own. What would you have? Something, and scarce so much, nothing, indeed. I would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith, yes, strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord. Go thou toward home, where I shall never come whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum. Great Mars, I put myself into thy file. Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove a lover of thy drum, hater of love. I have sent you a daughter-in-law. She hath recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded her, and sworn to make the 'not' eternal. You shall hear I am run away, know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough in the world I will hold a long distance. My duty to you. Your unfortunate son, Bertram. This is not well, rash and unbridled boy. To fly the favors of so good a king, to pluck his indignation on thy head by the misprising of a maid too virtuous for the contempt of empire. Oh, madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady. What is the matter? Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort. Your son will not be killed so soon as I thought he would. Why should he be killed? So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does. The danger is in standing to't. That's the loss of men, though it be the getting of children. Here they come, will tell you more. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone. Do not say so. Think upon patience. I pray you, gentlemen, I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief, that the first face of neither, on the start, can woman me unto it. Where is my son, I pray you? Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence. We met him thitherward, for thence we came, and after some dispatch in hand at court, thither we bend again. Look on his letter, madam. Here's my passport. When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which never shall come off and show me a child begotten of thy body that I am father to, then call me husband, but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.' This is a dreadful sentence. Brought you this letter, gentlemen? Ay, madam, and for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains. I prithee, lady, be of better cheer. If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine, thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son, but I do wash his name out of my blood, and thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he? [first man] Ay, madam. And to be a soldier? Such is his noble purpose, and believe it, the duke will lay upon him all the honor that good convenience claims. Return you thither? [second man] Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed. Till I have no wife I have nothing in France. 'Tis bitter. Find you that there? Ay, madam. It is but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his heart was not consenting to. Nothing in France, until he have no wife. There's nothing here that is too good for him but only she, and she deserves a lord that twenty such rude boys should tend upon and call her hourly mistress. Who was with him? A servant only, and a gentleman which I have sometime known. Parolles, was it not? Ay, my good lady, he. A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness. My son corrupts a well-derived nature with his inducement. Indeed, good lady, the fellow has a deal of that too much, which holds him much to have. You're welcome, gentlemen. I will entreat you, when you see my son, to tell him that his sword can never win the honor that he loses. More I'll entreat you written to bear along. We serve you, madam. "Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France." Nothing in France, until he has no wife. Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France. Then hast thou all again. Poor lord. Is it I that chase thee from thy country and expose those tender limbs of thine to the event of the none-sparing war? Is thy that drive thee from the sportive court, where thou wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark of smoky muskets? Oh, you leaden messengers, that ride upon the violent speed of fire, fly with false aim, move the still-peering air, that sings with piercing, do not touch my lord. Whoever shoots at him, I set him to it, whoever charges on his forward breast, I am the caitiff that do hold him to it, and, though I kill him not, I am the cause his death was so effected. Better 'twere I met the ravin lion when he roared with sharp constraint of hunger. Better 'twere that all the miseries which nature owes were mine at once. No. Come thou home, Rousillon, whence honor but of danger wins a scar, as oft it loses all. I will be gone. My being here it is that holds thee hence. Shall I stay here to do it? No. No, although the air of paradise did fan the house and angels officed all. I will be gone, that pitiful rumor may report my flight to consulate thine ear. Come, night. End, day. For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away. Alas, and would you take the letter from her? Might you not know she would do as she has done by sending me a letter? Read it again. I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone. Ambitious love hath so in me offended that barefoot plod I the cold ground upon, with sainted vow my faults to have amended. Write, write, that from the bloody course of war my dearest master, your dear son, may hie. Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far. His name with zealous fervor sanctify. He is too good and fair for death and me. Whom I myself embrace, to set him free. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words. Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much as letting her pass so. Had I spoke with her I could have well diverted her intents, which thus she hath prevented. Pardon me, madam, if I had given you this at overnight, she might have been o'erta'en and yet she writes "pursuit would be but vain." What angel shall bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive, unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear and loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath of greatest justice. Write. Write, Rinaldo, to this unworthy husband of his wife. Let every word weigh heavy of her worth which he does weigh too light. My greatest grief, though little he do feel it, set down sharply. Dispatch the most convenient messenger. If haply he shall hear that she is gone, he will return. Then hope I may that she, hearing so much, will speed her foot again, led hither by pure love. Which of them both is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense to make distinction. Provide this messenger. My heart is heavy and mine age is weak. Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak. [somber orchestral music] [slapping] They say the French count has done most honorable service. It is reported that he has taken their greatest commander and that with his own hand he slew the duke's brother. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl. The honor of a maid is her name and no legacy is so rich as honesty. I have told my neighbor how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion. I know that knave, hang him! One Parolles, a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana. Their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust are not the things they go under. Many a maid hath been seduced by them and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them. I hope I need not to advise you further but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost. You shall not need to fear me. I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim. God save you, pilgrim, whither abound? To Saint Jaques le Grand. Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you? At the Saint Francis here. If you will tarry, holy pilgrim, but till the troops come by, I will conduct you where you shall be lodged. The rather, for I think I know your hostess as ample as myself. Is it yourself? If you shall please so, pilgrim. I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure. [chopping on board] You came, I think, from France? I did so. Here you shall see a countryman of yours has done worthy service. His name, I pray you. The Count Rousillon, know you such a one? But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him. His face I know not. Whatsome'er he is, he's bravely taken here. He stole from France, as 'tis reported, for the king had married him against his liking. Think you it is so? Ay, surely, mere the truth. I know his lady. There is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her. What's his name? Monsieur Parolles. Oh, I believe with him, in argument of praise, or to the worth of the great count himself, she is too mean to have her name repeated. All her deserving is a reserved honesty and that I have not heard examined. Alas, poor lady. 'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord. I wait, good creature, wheresoe'er she is, her heart weighs sadly. [trumpet fanfare] This young maid might do her a shrewd turn, if she so chose. How do you mean? May be the amorous count solicits her in the unlawful purpose. He does indeed, and brokes with all that can in such a suit corrupt the tender honor of a maid. But she is armed for him and keeps her guard in honestest defense. The gods forbid else! So, now they come! That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son. That, Escalus. Which is the Frenchman? He, that with the plume. 'Tis a most gallant fellow. I would he loved his wife. If he were honester he were much goodlier. Is it not a handsome gentleman? I like him well. 'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave that leads him to these places. Were I his lady, I would poison that vile rascal. Which is he? That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy? Perchance he's hurt in the battle. Lose our drum! Well! He's shrewdly vexed at something. Look, he has spied us! Hang you! And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier! The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you where you shall host. Of enjoined penitents there's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound, already at my house. I humbly thank you. Please it this matron and this gentle maid to eat with us tonight. The charge and thanking shall be for me, and, to requite you further, I will bestow some precepts of this virgin worthy the note. We'll take your offer kindly. Nay, good my lord, put him to it, let him have his way. If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect. On my life, my lord, a bubble. Do you think I am so far deceived in him? Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment. It were fit you knew him, lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you. I would I knew in what particular action to try him. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do. I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly surprise him. Such I will have, whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy. We will bind and hoodwink him, so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. [Bertram laughs] Be but your lordship present at his examination. If he do not, for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in any thing. Oh, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum. He says he has a stratagem for it. If your lordship sees the bottom of his success in it, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes. [whispering] Oh, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honor of his design. Let him fetch off his drum in any hand. How now, monsieur, this drum sticks sorely in your disposition. A pox on't, let it go, 'tis but a drum. "But a drum!" Is't "but a drum?" A drum so lost! There was excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers! That was not to be blamed in the command of the service. It was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success. Some dishonor we had in the loss of that drum, but it is not to be recovered. It might have been recovered. It might, but it is not now. It is to be recovered, but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.' Why, if you have a stomach, to it, monsieur. If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honor again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on. I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it. [Bertram] But you must not now slumber in it. I'll about it this evening and I will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation, and by midnight look to hear further from me. May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it? I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the attempt I vow. [trumpet fanfare] I know thou art valiant, and to the possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell. I love not many words. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done, damns himself to do it and dares better be damned than to do't? You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's favor and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries, but when you find him out, you have him ever after. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto? None in the world, but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we've almost embossed him. You shall see his fall tonight, for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect. We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu, when his disguise and he is parted you tell me what a sprat you shall find him, which you shall see this very night. I must go look my twigs, he shall be caught. Your brother, he shall go along with me. As it please your lordship, I'll leave you. Now, will I lead you to the house, and show you the lass I spoke of. But you say she's honest. That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once and found her wondrous cold. But I sent to her by this same coxcomb that we have in the wind, tokens and letters which she did re-send. This is all I have done. She's a fair creature. Will you go see her? With all my heart, my lord. If you misdoubt me that I am not she I know not how I shall assure you further, but I shall lose the grounds I work upon. Though my estate be fallen I was well born, nothing acquainted with these businesses and would not put my reputation now in any staining act. Nor would I wish you. First, give me trust, the Count, he is my husband, and what to your sworn counsel I have spoken is so from word to word, then you cannot, by the good aid that I of you shall borrow, err in bestowing it. I should believe you, for you have showed me that which well approves you're great in fortune. Take this purse of gold and let me buy your friendly help thus far, which I will over-pay and pay again when I have found it. The Count, he wooes your daughter, lays down his wanton siege before her beauty, resolved to carry her. Let her in fine consent, as we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it. Now, his important blood will nought deny that she'll demand. A ring, the Count, he wears, which downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son, some four or five descents since the first father wore it. This ring he holds in most rich choice, yet in his idle fire, to buy his will, it would not seem too dear, howe'er repented after. Now I see the bottom of your purpose. You see it lawful, then. It is no more but that your daughter, ere she seems as won, desires this ring, appoints him an encounter. In fine, delivers me to fill the time, herself most chastely absent. After this, to marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns to what is passed already. I have yielded. Instruct my daughter how she shall persever that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent. Every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs composed to her unworthiness. Nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves for he persists as if his life lay on't. Why then, tonight, let us assay our plot, which, if it speed is wicked meaning in a lawful deed, and lawful meaning in a lawful act, where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact. But let's about it. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will. Though you understand it not yourselves, no matter, for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter. Good captain, let me be the interpreter. Ah, are you not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice? No, sir, I warrant you. But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again? E'en such as you speak to me. [all laugh] He must think us some band of strangers in the adversary's entertainment. Now, he hath a smack of all neighboring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another, that we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose. Choughs' language. [all chattering gibberish] Gabble enough, gabble enough, and, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch! Ho! [Parolles groaning] Here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forges. [trumpet fanfare] [yawning] Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it not daring the reports of my tongue. This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility and knowing I had no such purpose? Is it possible he should know what he is and be that he is? Oh, would I had any drum of the enemy's. I would swear I recovered it. You shall hear one anon. [drumming] A drum now of the enemy's... [yelling in gibberish] [speaking gibberish] I know you are the Muskos' regiment, and I shall lose my life for want of language. If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch, Italian, or French, let him speak to me. I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine. [speaking gibberish] I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue. [speaking gibberish] The general is content to spare thee yet, and, hoodwinked as thou art, will lead thee on to gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform something to save thy life. Oh, let me live, and all the secrets of our camp I'll show. Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that which you will wonder at. [laughs] They told me that your name was Fontibell. No, my good lord, Diana. Titled goddess. And worth it, with addition. But, fair soul, in your fine frame hath love no quality? If quick fire of youth light not your mind, you are no maiden, but a monument. When you are dead, you should be such a one as you are now, for you are cold and stern. Now you should be as your mother was when your sweet self was got. She then was honest. So should you be. No. My mother did but duty, such, my lord, as you owe to your wife. No more of that. I prithee, do not strive against my vows. I was compelled to her. But I love thee by love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever do thee all rights of service. Ay, so you serve us till we serve you but when you have our roses, you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness. How have I sworn! 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth but the plain single vow that is vowed true. What is not holy, that we swear not by but take the Highest to witness. Then, pray you, tell me, if I should swear by Jove's great attributes, I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths, when I did love you ill? This has no holding, to swear by him whom I protest to love that I will work against him. Therefore, your oaths are words and poor conditions but unsealed. At least in my opinion. Change it. Change it. Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy. My integrity ne'er knew the crafts that you do charge men with. Stand no more off but give thyself unto my sick desires who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever my love as it begins shall so persever. I see that men make ropes in such a scarre that we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but I have no power to give it from me. Will you not, my lord? It is an honor longing to our house, bequeathed down from many ancestors which were the greatest obloquy in the world in me to lose. Mine honor's such a ring. My chastity's the jewel of our house, bequeathed down from many ancestors which were the greatest obloquy in the world in me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honor on my part, against your vain assault. Here, take my ring, mine honor, my house, yea, my life, be thine, and I'll be bid by thee. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window. I'll order take my mother shall not hear. Now shall I charge you in the band of truth, when you have conquered my yet maiden bed remain there but an hour, nor speak to me. My reasons are most strong and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be delivered. And on your finger in the night I'll put another ring, that what in time proceed may token to the future our past deeds. Adieu, till then, then, fail not. You have won a wife of me, though there my hope be done. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee. For which live long to thank both heaven and me! You may so in the end. My mother told me just how he would woo as if she sat in his heart. She says all men have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me when his wife's dead. Therefore I'll lie with him when I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid, marry that will, I'll live and die a maid. Only in this disguise I thinks't no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win. Have you not given him his mother's letter? I have delivered it an hour since. There's something in't that stings his nature, for on the reading it he changed almost into another man. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave of it. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown, and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honor. He hath given her his monumental ring and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition. Now, God delay our rebellion. As we are ourselves, what things are we! Merely our own traitors. As in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream o'erflows himself. Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? Shall we not then have his company tonight? Not till after midnight, for he is dieted to his hour. That approaches apace. [both laugh] I would gladly have him see his company anatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit. We will not meddle with him till he come for his presence must be the whip of the other. In the mean time, what hear you of these wars? I hear there is an overture of peace. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded. What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return again into France? I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether of his council. [laughs] Let it be forbid, sir. So should I be a great deal of his act. Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house. Her pretense is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished, and, there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief. In fine, made a groan of her last breath and now she sings in heaven. How is this justified? The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death. Her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place. Hath the count all this intelligence? Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity. I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses. And how mightily some other times do we drown our gain in tears. The great dignity that his valor hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together. Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not, and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues. Ah, how now, my lord! Is't not after midnight? I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a month's length a-piece. I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest, buried a wife, mourned for her, writ to my lady mother I am returning, entertained my convoy, between these main parcels of dispatch, effected many nicer needs. [all laugh] The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended yet. If the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship. I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But, shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come on, bring forth this counterfeit module. He has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier. Bring him forth. Hath sat in the stocks all night, poor gallant knave. No matter. His heels have deserved it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself? I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him. [all laugh] But to answer you as you would be understood, he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk. He hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting in the stocks. And what think you he hath confessed? Nothing of me, has he? His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face. If your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it. A plague on him. Muffled, he can say nothing of me. Hush, hush! Hoodman comes. [banging on table] [speaking gibberish] He calls for the tortures. No! What will you say without them? I will confess what I know without constraint. If ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more. [speaking gibberish] You are a merciful general. Our general bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note. And truly, as I hope to live. "First, demand of him how many horse the duke is strong." What say you to that? Five or six thousand, but very weak and unserviceable. The troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live. Shall I set down your answer so? Do, I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will. All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this. You're deceived, my lord. This is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist. That was his own phrase, that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly. Well, that's set down. Five or six thousand horse, I said, I will say true, or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth. He's very near the truth in this. But I con him no thanks in it for the nature he delivers it. "Demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot." What say you to that? By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty, Sebastian, so many, Corambus, so many, Jaques, so many, Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each, mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and fifty each, so that the muster-file, upon my life, rotten and sound amounts not to fifteen thousand poll. Half of the which dare not shake snow from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces. [laughing] What shall be done to him? [whispering] Nothing, let him have thanks. [speaking gibberish] [whispering] Demand of him my condition, and what credit I have with the duke. [speaking normally] Well, that's set down. "You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain -be in the camp, -Dumain... a Frenchman. What his reputation is with the duke, what his valor, honesty, and expertness in wars, or whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to revolt." What say you to that? What do you know of it? I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories. Demand them singly. Do you know this Captain Dumain? I know him, a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's fool with child, a dumb innocent, that could not say him nay. [whispering] Hold your hands, by your leave. Though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls. Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp? Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy. [Bertram laughs] Nay look not so upon me. We shall hear of your lordship anon. [soldier] What is his reputation with the duke? [Parolles] The duke? The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine, and writ to me this other day to turn him out of the band. I think I have his letter in my pocket. Marry, we'll search. In good sadness, I do not know either it is there, or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters in my tent. Here 'tis, here's a paper. Shall I read it to you? I do not know if it be it or no. Our interpreter does it well. Excellently. "Diane, the Count's a fool, and full of gold..." That is not the duke's letter, sir, no, no, that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again. Nay, I'll read it first, by your favor. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid for I knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds. [whispers] Damnable both-sides rogue! "When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it. After he scores, he never pays the score. Half won is match well made. Match, and well make it. He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before, and say a soldier, Diane, told thee this, men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss. For count of this, the Count's a fool, I know it, who pays before, but not when he does owe it. Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear, Parolles." Parolles. He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in's forehead. [speaking gibberish] [whispering] This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier. I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me. I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be fain to hang you. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die, but that, my offences being many, I shall repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, in the stocks, or any where, so I may live. We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely. Therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain. What is his honesty? [mumbles] He will lie, sir, with such volubility, you would think truth were a fool. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain? [whispers] Why does he ask him of me? [soldier] What's he? E'en a crow of the same nest. He excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine? Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon. I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure. [Parolles whimpers] I'll no more drumming, a plague of all drums. Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy, the Count, have I run into this danger. Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken? There is no remedy, sir, but you must die. [crying] Oh, no! The general says, you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use. Therefore, you must die. [Parolles whimpers] [Parolles breathes shakily] [first lord] Come, headsman, off with his head. [metal scrapping] [Parolles screams] [crying] Oh, Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death! That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends. Look about you, know you any here? Good morrow, noble captain. God bless you, Captain Parolles. God save you, noble captain. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am for France. Good captain, could you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? An I were not a very coward, I'd compel it of you, but fare you well. [Parolles grunts angrily] You are undone, captain, all but your scarf, that has a knot on't yet. Who cannot be crushed with a plot? If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame you might begin an impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir. I am for France too. We shall speak of you there. [laughs] Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great 'twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more. But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft as captain shall. Simply the thing I am shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart, let him fear this, for it will come to pass that every braggart shall be found an ass. Rust, sword? Cool, blushes, and, Parolles, live safest in shame. Being fooled, by foolery thrive. There's place and means for every man alive. I'll after 'em. That you may well perceive I have not wronged you, one of the greatest in the Christian world shall be my surety, 'fore whose throne 'tis needful, ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel. Time was, I did him a desired office, dear almost as his life. You must know I am supposed dead. The army breaking, my husband hies him home, where, heaven aiding, and by the leave of my good lord the king, we'll be before our welcome. Gentle madam, you never had a servant to whose trust your business was more welcome. Nor you, mistress, ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labor to recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower, as it is fated her to be my motive and helper to a husband. But, oh strange men. That can such sweet use make of what they hate. But more of this hereafter. You, Diana, under my poor instructions yet must suffer something in my behalf. Let death and honesty go with your impositions. I am yours upon your will to suffer. Yet, I pray you. But with the word the time will bring on summer, when briers shall have leaves as well as thorns, and be as sweet as sharp. We must away, our wagon is prepared and time revives us. All's well that ends well. Still the fine's the crown, whate'er the course the end is the renown. No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in his color. Your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour and your son here at home, more advanced by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of. I would I had not known him. It was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I could not have owed her a more rooted love. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or rather, the herb of grace. They are not salad herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir, I have not much skill in grass. What dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool? A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's. Your distinction? I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service. So you were a knave at his service, indeed. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service. I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool. At your service. No, no, no. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you are. What prince is that? The black prince, sir, alias, the prince of darkness, alias, the devil. Hmm. Hold thee, take my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of, serve him still. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire, and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the world, let his nobility remain in's court. I am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may but the many will be too chill and tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire. A shrewd knave and an unhappy. So he is. My late lord made himself much sport out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness. Indeed, he has no pace but runs where he will. I like him well, 'tis not amiss. I was about to tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and that my lord your son was upon his return home, I moved his majesty to speak in the behalf of my daughter, which, in the minority of them both, his majesty, with self-gracious remembrance, did first propose. His highness hath promised me to do it. And, to stop up the displeasure that he hath conceived against your son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it? With very much content, and I wish it happily effected. His highness will be here tomorrow, of as able body as when he numbered thirty. It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I die. I have letters that my son will be here this evening and I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me until they meet together. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted. You need but plead your honorable privilege. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter but I thank my God it holds yet. Madam, yonder's my lord your son. Let us go see your son, I pray you. I long to talk with the young noble soldier. What's your will? That it will please you to give this poor petition to the king and aid me with that store of power you have to come into his presence. The king's not here. Not here, sir? Not, indeed. He hence removed last night and with more haste than is his use. Lord, how we lose our pains. [servant] But this exceeding posting day and night must wear your spirits low. [Diana] We cannot help it. All's well that ends well, yet, though time seem so adverse and means unfit. I do beseech you, whither is he gone? Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon, whither I am going. I do beseech you, sir, since you are like to see the king before me, commend the paper to his gracious hand, which I presume shall render you no blame but rather make you thank your pains for it. I will come after you with what good speed our means will make us means. This I'll do for you. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter. I have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes, but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure. Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of. Prithee, allow the wind. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir, I spake but by a metaphor. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose, or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper. Prithee, stand away. A paper from fortune's close-stool to give to a nobleman. Here he comes himself. Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal. I do pity his distress and leave him to your lordship. My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched. And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a, there's a quart d'ecu for you. Let the justices make you and fortune friends. I am for other business. I beseech your honor to hear me one single word. You beg a single penny more. Come, you shall ha't, save your word. My name, my good lord, is Parolles. Give me your hand. How does your drum? Oh, my good lord, you were the first that found me. Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out. Out on thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me both the office of God and the devil? One brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out. [trumpet sounds] The king is coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me. I had talk of you last night. Though you are a knave and fool, you shall eat. Oh, my lord... Go to. I praise God for you. We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem was made much poorer by it. But your son, as mad in folly, lacked the sense to know her estimation home. 'Tis past, my liege, and I beseech your majesty to make it natural rebellion, done in the blaze of youth, when oil and fire, too strong for reason's force, o'erbears it and burns on. My honoured lady, I have forgiven and forgotten all, though my revenges were high bent upon him, and watched the time to shoot. This I must say, though first I beg my pardon, the young lord did to his majesty, his mother and his lady offence of mighty note, but to himself the greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife whose beauty did astonish the survey of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive, whose dear perfection hearts that scorned to serve humbly called mistress. Praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither. We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill all repetition. Let him not ask your pardon. The nature of his great offense is dead, and deeper than oblivion we do bury the incensing relics of it. Let him approach, a stranger, no offender, and inform him so it is our will he should. I shall, my liege. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke? All that he is hath reference to your highness. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me that sets him high in fame. He looks well on't. I am not a day of season, for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail in me at once, but to the brightest beams distracted clouds give way, so stand thou forth, the time is fair again. My high-repented blames, dear sovereign, pardon to me. All is whole. Not one word more of the consumed time. Let's take the instant by the forward top, for we are old, and on our quickest decrees the inaudible and noiseless foot of time steals ere we can effect them. You remember the daughter of this lord? Admiringly, my liege. At first I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart durst make too bold a herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing, contempt his scornful perspective did lend me, which warped the line of every other favor, scorned a fair color, or expressed it stolen, extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object. Thence it was that she whom all men praised and whom myself, since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye the dust that did offend it. Well excused. Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust, destroy our friends and after weep their dust, our own love waking cries to see what's done, while shame full hate sleeps out the afternoon. Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her. Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin. The main consents are had and here we'll stay to see our widower's second marriage-day. Which better than the first, oh, dear heaven, bless! Or, ere they meet, in me, oh, nature, cesse! Come on, my son, in whom my house's name must be digested, give a favor from you to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter, that she may quickly come. By my old beard, and every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead, was a sweet creature. Such a ring as this, the last that e'er I took her at court, I saw upon her finger. Hers it was not. Let me see it. For mine eye, while I was speaking, oft was fastened to't. This ring was mine, and, when I gave it Helen, I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood necessitied to help, that by this token I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave her of what should stead her most? My gracious sovereign, howe'er it pleases you to take it so, the ring was never hers. Son, on my life, I have seen her wear it, and she reckoned it at her life's rate. I am sure I saw her wear it. You are deceived, my lord, she never saw it. In Florence was it from a casement thrown me, wrapped in a paper, which contained the name of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought I stood engaged, but when I had subscribed to mine own fortune and informed her fully I could not answer in that course of honor as she had made the overture, she ceased in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again. Plutus himself, that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine, hath not in nature's mystery more science than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine! 'Twas Helen's! Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement you got it from her. She called the saints to surety that she would never put it from her finger, unless she gave it to yourself in bed, where you have never come, or sent it us upon her great disaster. She never saw it! Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honor, and makest conjectural fears to come into me which I would fain shut out. If it should prove that thou art so inhuman, 'twill not prove so, and yet I know not. Thou didst hate her deadly, and she is dead, which nothing, but to close her eyes myself, could win me to believe, more than to see this ring. Take him away! We'll sift this matter further. I am wrapped in dismal thinkings. Gracious sovereign, whether I have been to blame or no, I know not, but here's a petition from a Florentine, who hath for four or five removes come short to tender it herself. I undertook it, vanquished thereto by the fair grace and speech of the poor suppliant, who by this I know is here, attending. Her business looks in her with an importing visage, and she told me, in a sweet verbal brief, it did concern your highness with herself. "Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower, his vows are forfeited to me, and my honor's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, oh, king. In you it best lies, otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone. Diana Capilet." I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this. I'll none of him. The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu, to bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors. Go speedily and bring again the count. I am afeard the life of Helen, lady, was foully snatched. Now, justice on the doers! I wonder, sir, since wives are monsters to you, and that you fly them as you swear them lordship, yet you desire to marry. What woman's that? I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine, derived from the ancient Capilet. My suit, as I do understand, you know, and therefore know how far I may be pitied. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honor both suffer under this complaint we bring, and both shall cease, without your remedy. Count, do you know these women? My lord, I neither can nor will deny but that I know them. Do they charge me further? Why do you look so strange upon your wife? She's none of mine, my lord. If you shall marry, you give away this hand, and that is mine, you give away heaven's vows, and those are mine, you give away myself, which is known mine, for I by vow am so embodied yours, that she which marries you must marry me, either both or none. Your reputation comes too short for my daughter. You're no husband for her. My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature, whom sometime I have laughed with. Let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honor than for to think that I would sink it here. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend till your own deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honor than in my thought it lies. Good my lord, ask him upon his oath, if he does think he had not my virginity. What say'st thou to her? She's impudent, my lord, and was a common gamester to the camp! He does me wrong, my lord. If I were so, he might have bought me at a common price. Do not believe him. Oh, behold this ring, whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel, and yet for all that, he gave it to a commoner of the camp, if I be one. He blushes, and 'tis it. Of six preceding ancestors, that gem, conferred by testament to the sequent issue, hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife. That ring's a thousand proofs. Methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce so bad an instrument. His name's Parolles. [Lafeu] I saw the man today, if man he be. Find him, and bring him hither. What of him? He's quoted for a most perfidious slave, with all the spots of the world taxed and deboshed, whose nature sickens but to speak a truth. Am I or that or this for what he'll utter, that will speak any thing? She hath that ring of yours. I think she has. Certain it is I liked her, boarded her in the wanton way of youth. She knew her distance and did angle for me, madding my eagerness with her restraint, as all impediments in fancy's course are motives of more fancy. In fine, her infinite cunning, with her modern grace subdued me to her rate. She got the ring, and I had that which any inferior might at market-price have bought. I must be patient. You, that have turned off a first so noble wife may justly diet me. I pray you yet, since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband. Send for your ring, I will return it home, and give me mine again. I have it not. What ring was yours, I pray you? Sir, much like the same upon your finger. Know you, this ring? This ring was his of late. And this was it I gave him, being abed. The story then goes false, you threw it him out of a casement. I have spoke the truth. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers. You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you. Is this the man you speak of? Ay, my lord. Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you, not fearing the displeasure of your master, which on your just proceeding I'll keep off. By him and by this woman here what know you? So please your majesty, my master hath been an honorable gentleman. Tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have. Come, come, to the purpose. Did he love this woman? Faith, sir, he did love her, but how? How, I pray you? He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman. How is that? He loved her, sir, and loved her not. As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an equivocal companion is this! I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator. Drum! Do you know he promised me marriage? Faith, I know more than I'll speak. But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest? Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them, as I said, but more than that, he loved her. For indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of, therefore I will not speak what I know. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou can say they are married. But thou art too fine in thy evidence, therefore stand aside. This ring, you say, was yours? Ay, my good lord. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you? It was not given me, nor I did not buy it. Who lent it you? It was not lent me neither. Where did you find it, then? I found it not. If it were yours by none of all these ways, how could you give it him? I never gave it him. This woman's an easy glove, my lord, she goes off and on at pleasure. [Countess gasps] This ring was mine. I gave it his first wife. It might be yours or hers, for aught I know. Take her away, I do not like her now, and away with him! Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring, within this hour thou diest. I'll never tell you. Take her away. I'll put in bail, my liege. I think thee now some common customer. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you. Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while? Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty. He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't. I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not. Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life, I am either maid, or else this old man's wife. She does abuse our ears! To prison with her! Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay. Royal sir. The jeweler that owes the ring is sent for, and he shall surety me. But for this lord who hath abused me, as he knows himself, though yet he never harmed me, here I quit him. He knows himself my bed he hath defiled, and at that time he got his wife with child. Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick. So there's my riddle. One that's dead is quick. And now behold the meaning. [orchestral music] Is there no exorcist beguiles the truer office of mine eyes? Is't real that I see? No, my good lord. 'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see. The name and not the thing. Both, both... Oh, pardon! Oh, my good lord, when I was like this maid, I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring, and, look you, here's your letter. This it says: "When from my finger you can get this ring and are by me with child," etcetera. This is done. Will you be mine, now you are doubly won? If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly. If it appear not plain and prove untrue, deadly divorce step between me and you. Oh, my dear mother, do I see you living? Mine eyes smell onions. I shall weep anon. Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I thank thee. Wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee. Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones. Let us from point to point this story know, to make the even truth in pleasure flow. If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower, choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower. For I can guess that by thy honest aid thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid. Of that and all the progress, more or less, resolvedly more leisure shall express. All yet seems well, and if it end so meet, the bitter past, more welcome is the sweet. [orchestral music]
