Kyoto Go and control traffic in the parking lot. Have enough envelopes? They're late. The funeral address was too long. We'll have to cut out the telegrams. We'll need more censer stands. Bring two censer stands. Where are they? There's a pile of spare ones in the car. Yes, sir. What are you doing? Never mind. You get the censer stands. Is she going to make it? Give her a chance. Not too many girls want to work for an undertaker. Still...! Are you all right? She feels ill. Is she with you? No. But can she rest somewhere? Can you walk? Here's a pillow. Have some water? I must be going. Take care. TWO GRAVESTONES "Belle Maison RAKUNAN" Haruhiko? Hello? Oh, it's you, Akiyama. What do you mean "Oh"? Who were you expecting? No one. What is it? Are you familiar with the Wakamizu School of Japanese dance? Sure. Itâ€™s one of the top two in Kansai. Its head is Wakamizu Juho, I believe. Juho's passed away. He has? There's going to be a big funeral. There's just one problem. What problem? I can't tell you over the phone. Can you come to the Lake Riwa Grand Hotel? I'll be in the lobby. Come in regular clothes and bring the van. Hello...? Why? Akiyama! Akiko! What is it? Don't tell me Juho passed away here. Juho's body is here. Let's move it to his home. We can't. Why not? He was with a young woman. A woman? He died "in the act." In the...? No! For the sake of appearances, his wife wants to say he died at home. His wife is here? The woman panicked and phoned her. It's an unnatural death. We can't move the body. A doctor's confirmed he died of illness. Strictly speaking, there are problems. But compromising celebrity deaths have always been kept under wraps. The police look the other way. They do? Look, business is business. Think of the fees for the wake, the funeral, and the parting ceremony. And the profits from all the accoutrements. It's big money for us! Akiyama... Sorry. I got carried away. It's business. Do what you have to do. Business is business! That's it! Somehow I feel like I'm walking into a trap. Akiko. Let's go! The master's wife is his second wife. Very pretty, and about your age. That young? Sorry to be late. This is my boss. I'm Ishihara. You have my deepest sympathy. It's you. Why, yes. An acquaintance? I saw her at Yamada's funeral recently. I didn't notice. Dr. Iwamoto examined my husband. He was deceased by the time I came. The cause of death was a stroke. Nothing questionable. A stroke? My husband had high blood pressure. He had a minor stroke a year ago. You'd better have the family doctor write the death certificate. Aren't you the family doctor? I just happened to be in the hotel. My wife is a Wakamizu pupil. You don't say. Well, I'd better be going. I'm sorry for imposing. Thank you. Pardon me, I must be leaving. Mr. Akiyama must have told you. Will you move my husband's body? Yes. Certainly. I will gladly, gladly accept this this task. Leave it to us, we'll take care of everything without fail. Just a moment. Errr.. Pardon me for asking this, but where's the woman your husband was with? Akiko... I paid her to leave. Paid her? It may seem strange. But I had to protect the Wakamizu reputation. Will you do it? Certainly. Shouldn't we dress the body? I put on his underwear. Akiyama? Open up! Where did you find this? I have connections. In there? Just for a while. Such color. He looks like he's sleeping. I'll hold his head. -He's heavy. -It's OK. I'll take the feet, Akiko. You take the waist. Yes. And... lift! Change places... this way... yes... Make sure we don't forget anything. You take this room. There's no one around. Ah, madam. We'll be waiting at the back door. Take care of checking out straight away and then come. Understood. Hold on a second. OK, got it. Well that worked out well. We can relax now we've got this far. I feel a bit like a murderer. Enough of the silly talk. Everything we do is to help people. And for money. That too. "Wakamizu Juho" "Service Entrance" Is anyone home? No. It's a day off for everyone. That's perfect. Everything went well. Thanks to you two. We're happy to have helped. We'll go back to the office and stand by. I'll call the family doctor now. Won't the family doctor think it's strange? Huh? About Juho. That it's already been two hours since he died. And Rigor Mortis is starting to set in. If an expert saw that, they would certainly think it's suspicious. Then it depends how well the wife plays it. I guess it's possible she might confess everything, I don't know. Everything? Yeah. If it's a longtime family doctor. If you worry unnecessarily too much. You'll get old before your time. I already have. Why so huffy? Had a fight with Haruhiko? Here it comes! Ishihara Mortuary. Mrs. Wakamizu? Master Juho of the Wakamizu School? My deepest sympathy. We'll be right there. This is it! "In Mourning" If you're not sure of anything, ask the old guy! Hurry up! Everyone's running, you too! You, fool! Go! Good work! Is he getting on your case? I don't care. Funerals are interesting. Interesting? Wrong thing to say. The death certificate, Akiko? The family doctor wrote it up right away. See? No problem, I'll take it. The funeral date? The wake's on the 2nd, and a private funeral on the 3rd, and the funeral when the children come home. The children? Juho had two children by his first wife. The eldest is a musician in New York. With no intention of carrying on the school? The other is a daughter attending a Tokyo college. She has no interest in Japanese dance, so they have a succession problem. What about his wife? Wasn't she a pupil? That's a whole other problem. Mrs. Wakamizu? Father! Where's Father? Father...! Why? Why so suddenly? I can't believe it! Someone tell me! I told you over the phone. He had a stroke. Not you! You always looked after Father, Mitsuyo. What happened last night? I'm sorry! I was back at home. At home? There were no lessons, so everyone was out. You were? You mean Father was here alone with her? What did you do to Father? What do you mean? I mean, didn't you kill Father? That's going a bit too far, Yumiko! Why would I kill your father? Ask yourself. You married him to take over the school. Just a minute. Your father did die of illness. The doctor wrote a death certificate. You stay out of it! This is a family matter. It's not for some lowly undertaker. Lowly undertaker? You think a scrap of paper means anything to a daughter who's lost her father? Stay out of it! No way! We undertakers have procedures to follow. If you have doubts about the cause of death, why not have the police investigate? If the police do investigate, everything's off. Why, there may even be an autopsy. An autopsy? So suit yourself. Let's call the police. I am Wakamizu Juho's wife. I won't stand to be accused of his murder. Call the police. No, Mistress! Please, Miss Yumiko! Fine. Call the police. I have my doubts about the master's death. Let's get to the truth of it. You be quiet! Go on. Call the police. It's Inspector Kariya. Don't tell him about moving the body. It'll get messy. I know! Inspector Kariya! Some family members doubt the cause of death. It's our job to investigate. This is Dr. Eto, the medical examiner. How do you do? It involves the problem of Wakamizu succession. We'll see if it was a natural death or not. If this turns into a police case, everything will go up in smoke! We'll be in the red! That happened? Yes it did. So the wake is put off for now. That's terrible. Akiyama must be pale. In a panic, I'd say. What if it's one of those? Those what? "Wakamizu Master Dies Mysteriously." "Internal Struggle for Succession!" You've been watching too much TV. The results? Ishihara Mortuary. She's here. Your future husband. Hello, Haruhiko? From the bullet train? We just passed Nagoya. I'll be there in an hour. What shall I do? Go or you'll be late! What about the Wakamizus? Leave them to Akiyama. Is your place tidy? No. Go on! Contact me if something comes up. I know! Bye! Change into something more colorful! I wonder if she will. Why should I be so concerned? Ishihara Mortuary. Akiyama? Akiko? Well, she's... Gone home? She caught a cold so she went home to rest. She didn't look sick. What happened to the Wakamizu problem? He did die of illness. So everything's back on schedule? I'll run things here tonight. So tell her to get well and come out tomorrow. Is the boss sick? I wonder if...? If what? That incurable disease of hers. I don't get it. I'm having a bath. Will you join me? This is no good. Why'd I bring this? Akiko, could you take that for cleaning? How long can you stay? Till tomorrow or the day after. How about getting away for a few days before you start playing detective? Leave your work to Akiyama. Well... Hello? Yoshie? Any word?... That's good. What about tonight?... Thanks. I owe you one. Death by illness? Hiding something? I get the picture. The daughter sure came on strong. Bad blood between her and her stepmother. But to accuse her of murder. Maybe she had a good reason. Any ideas? No. But you know how the man died. "In the act"? It's the best way for a man to go. Seriously! Just kidding! That's terrible. Still, I've got a hunch there's something... Gently! Don't damage it! Don't drop it! Good morning! Sorry about last night. Oh, yes. How's your cold? It's... fine. That's good. It's nothing. Trouble! Now what? Everyone's arguing! Over what? The grave. The grave? You know Father loved his Lake Biwa villa. That's different. The Wakamizu family grave is here in Kyoto. Reiko... I mean, Mistress. Isn't it more important to honor the master's wishes? My husband's wishes? You know he bought a plot of land behind the villa. He wanted to rest in peace overlooking Lake Biwa. He also wanted to be interred, not cremated. We can't do that! Of course we can. Can't we? Well, yes, depending on the site. No! I won't have it! You mean to defy Father's wishes? Interment? Of all things. I don't know where her head's at. Maybe she still suspects the cause of death. If the body's interred, it can always be exhumed. For what, though? The police claim he died of a stroke. Why not tell her the truth? The truth? That he died, not at home with his wife, but at a hotel while having an affair. Everything's on hold till the son comes home. Hideo! She's like a little girl. Did you see a man with sunglasses? No. May I ask you something? Yumiko wanted to carry on the Wakamizu school? Her brother aspired to be a musician. But she loved dance, and the master had high hopes for her. What made her change? I did. She changed when I married her father. She used to be such a sweet girl. Not that I blame her. She was at a very impressionable age, when into her late mother's home came a woman young enough to be Juho's daughter. I tried to get along with her, but to no avail. It's hard to escape the stepmother image. Maybe that's my destiny. I want to talk to you, in private. Cremation? The ashes, however, will be buried in Kyoto as well as at Lake Biwa. Suit yourselves. I'm not through. When the funeral service and burial are over, we want you out of our house. What do you mean? We don't want you to carry on the school. You may be Wakamizu Juho's wife legally. But not to my sister and me. We'll compensate you for your years of service. But we want you to give up your inheritance. If you refuse to, we'll charge you with driving our father to this death. Both the family doctor and medical examiner have certified that he died of a stroke. Father was taking medication for high blood pressure. I know that. I gave it to him. You could easily have switched medications. Yumiko! You were the only one with him when he died. I would never do such a thing! Maybe not. But you might have left him to die. You're wrong! We'll let the court decide. That's enough! You're the undertaker. Listening in on us? Yes, and you're wrong to accuse her of killing master Juho. What would you know? Your stepmother wasn't there when your father died. What do you mean? You leave me no choice. Master Juho didn't die at home. He died in Room 1181 of the Lake Biwa Grand Hotel. A hotel? He was with a young woman. Don't you dare insult my father! I'm only stating the facts. You told them? You told me to. Stop playing detective! And? They wouldn't believe me at first. But they did? The brother did, but not the sister. Who'd want to believe that her father died while having an affair? Yeah. I'm regretting it a little that I said too much. I wonder what the wife will do? Reiko was engaged to someone else when Juho married her. Juho broke them up? He was a promising Wakamizu pupil. According to Yoshie, the know-it-all... Internal strife? Juho had a younger brother, Shinji. Shinji was the more talented of the two, and the school was divided as to which should carry on the Wakamizu tradition. Fed up with it, Shinji went abroad and that was that. But now he's rumored to be back in Japan. What does that have to do with Juho's death? Everything! Everyone knew Juho wasn't in good health, particularly those who supported Shinji. That changes things. Don't tell me you think Juho was murdered. It's a possibility. But the cause of death was... Stop sounding like a detective! This is my opinion as a physician. You could agitate a hypertensive person and cause his death. You mean Reiko hired a woman to cause Juho to die in the act? Or maybe Shinji did. I'm beginning to sound like a detective! You can't be sure he'll die, though. So what? You just keep trying. Cut it out! I still can't believe Reiko's a suspect. Not just her. Who has the most to gain from Juho's death? Most to gain? Reiko is a suspect. So is the brother, Shinji. And maybe someone who's trying to take control by marrying Yumiko. Will you go and take a look? Go where? The Lake Biwa Grand Hotel where Juho died. Haruhiku? Are you busy with a funeral tomorrow? I'm lonely. I've caught the detective's disease. Inspector Kariya. Do you have a moment? We got a strange call. A call? From a woman who claimed that Wakamizu Juho died at the Lake Biwa Grand. Did he? Why ask me? As the undertaker, didn't you rush over? Well, yes. To his home or to the hotel? What are you two up to? Akiyama... To his home, of course. Mrs. Wakamizu notified us of Master Juho's death at 11:05 that night. I could have gone over by myself. But it was the head of the Wakamizu School. I thought the boss should also go. So I woke Akiko up and we both went. I see. So it was a crank call. A bad one! Sorry to bother you. Anytime, sir! Well? Wakamizu Juho died at home. It was a crank call? For now. For now? I can't quit smoking, especially when something's bugging me. There's more to it? That we'll have to check, maybe at our own expense. I'm game. Let's go for a drive. A drive? To the Lake Biwa Grand Hotel. 1181... Here it is. Yes? Is this the room Wakamizu Juho was in? Who's that? Don't you know? No. There was a guest from Tokyo in here. From Tokyo? He was here on business for a week. A week in here? Yes. Is there something...? Oh, no. Pardon me. Thank you. I'm back. Hello. I'm beat. You are. The newcomer serves everyone tea. I didn't come here to serve tea. It's you! I'll give this cake to someone else then. I'll do it! Maybe we should get a tea maker. Don't waste money! I have to do the billings. What a workaholic! I'm going to get changed. Inspector Kariya? Excuse me! Bye! Why don't you call it a day? I'm staying awhile. You go on home. I'll stay, too. Oh, no! What? This. Moving fee with special casket. What special casket? That cardboard box we used. It was just an empty box. We needed it for the move. Come on! Forget it then. I'll mark up another item. I'll never go under with you around. Is that flattery or sarcasm? It's the ultimate compliment. Why, thank you. I'm going. You are? Lock up for me. It's you. Anything? Something odd. Odd? To tell the truth... Wait. You called the police? I told them the master died at a hotel. I was so sure it was Yumiko. Why would you tell the police and shame Master Juho? I just can't believe the master went out that night. Why is that? The master always went out in his limo. But the chauffeur was off that night. Maybe he took a taxi or hired a limo. He never took taxis, and always hired the same limo. But not that night. I can't believe he was with a woman, either. He used to have affairs in his younger days, but not anymore because of his poor health. Not even once in a while? No. I could tell when he was going out. When I heard of his death and rushed over, his hair was disheveled. Disheveled? In the casket, his hair was neatly combed. I used hair product and combed it for him. Did you really bring him back from the hotel? Of course. I'd never met him before. But I recognized him from the magazines. It was his body. She was convincing. About Juho not going out? What if Juho... Do you think I was dreaming? No. Akiyama was there, too. But something's bothering you. His hair? Juho's hair was combed at the hotel. So she lied about it being disheveled? How could it be unless it was shampooed? Besides... Besides what? His hair product had a strong scent. His hair product? But in the casket the next day... It was different? I feel like I'm flipping out. It was no ordinary death. I saw Inspector Kariya at the hotel. Inspector Kariya? With Detective Hashiguchi. He didn't believe our story. Not just that. He smelled a case. You said something was odd. Are you sure you moved Juho's body out of Room 1181? Absolutely sure. Why? Odd. What is? The housekeeper told me a Tokyo guest was in that room for the past week. No! Other staff told me the same thing. Who was this guest? A salaryman named Tanaka. What's going on? LAKE BIWA Anytime I'm on a drive with you I'm caught up in some kind of incident. That's impolite of me. Does it bother you? Don't be silly. If it bothered me, I'd have gone back to Tokyo already. "Lake Biwa Grand Hotel" They won't let us in. We aren't the police. If I go by the room, I'll know if I made a mistake. Inspector Kariya! Well, well. Staying at this hotel? No. Please. Which floor? The room? This one? Room 1181. It's open today. Want to see it? Been here before? Well... 5 nights ago, you moved Juho's body out of this room. Didn't you? I'm sorry. I'll let you go this time. But no more holding out on me. I don't get it. Someone else was in this room the past week. You know that? A Tokyo businessman named Tanaka was in this room. Then why was Juho's body in here? Yes, why? What do you think? Juho had a pupil book this room as Tanaka. Wrong. Juho did use this hotel. But she stayed in the best room under his real name. Tanaka was a nondescript man in his late 30s. Inspector! Got something? There was no Tanaka at the Tokyo address he left. That figures. So you've no lead on him? Just one. What? A maid saw a strange man in the hallway. A strange man? A man with dark-rimmed glasses and a mustache who looked like Tanaka from the back. But Tanaka doesn't wear glasses or a mustache. The maid was sure it was a disguise. A disguise? He was wearing a coat just like Tanaka's. What is it? When exactly did she see him? 5 nights ago. The night Juho died. Have an idea? It was him. The doctor? A Dr. Iwamoto. His wife knew Reiko, he said. Looks like we've got a lead. Excuse us. If Tanaka is Iwamoto, he's no doctor. He also booked that room for a purpose. If Reiko knew Iwamoto wasn't a doctor, she must have something to do with him. Well, yes. Why did she call us? To confirm to you Juho died of natural causes. Meaning he didn't? He was probably murdered at the hotel. He wasn't with any young woman. Reiko made that up. Why would that woman phone her? Reiko, Yumiko tells me the master died at a hotel. Who was this woman he was with? I don't know. The master died in this house. I know nothing about a hotel or... Stop pretending! Don't lie! Do you want to shame the master? If people find out he died at a hotel, you know what'll happen, Ogata! Did you notice anything unusual about the body? I'm thinking. Such color. He looks like he's sleeping. Such color? His cheeks were flushed. That's it. Cyanide. Cyanide? Cyanide poisoning causes flushing. It does? I assumed he died of a stroke, and that did it. Shape up, detective! Don't tease! Still, even if Reiko and Iwamoto did kill Juho, why at a hotel? Why not at home? Everyone was out. Reiko and Juho were alone. Perfect for a murder. What? How could I forget? Forget what? Doctors. The family doctor and the medical examiner also examined Juho's body. How could they not detect cyanide poisoning? You mean Juho did die of... ...a stroke. What was the big act at the hotel for? I don't know. Shape up! No woman? None of Juho's lovers were with him at the hotel. You checked their alibis? Of course. A mystery woman. What about Iwamoto? He's no doctor. But that's all we know. Good morning. Good morning, you say? It's around noon already. Are the funeral photos ready yet? Yes, I'm making up an album. Is the newspaper using smaller type these days? Why don't you get some new glasses? Oh yes! You'd look more stylish. Right? Enough of that. These glasses suit me fine. Give me that. It's him! I'm going out. It's that disease of hers again. Disease? The incurable one, you mean? No. The Sherlock Holmes Disease. I don't get it. It's... Do you know him? It's Nishiki, the mistress' lover. Reiko's lover? His name is Nishiki Masaya. He was the young hope of the Wakamizu School. Wasn't Reiko an accredited dancer, too? How could I miss it? Juho broke the two up and Nishiki vanished. So he had a motive for killing Juho. He and Reiko most likely killed Juho together. I think so. But why at a hotel? That's just it. Let's take it from the top. You and Akiyama confirmed Juho's death in Room 1181. Nishiki Masaya, posing as a doctor, declared that he died of a stroke. Two other doctors then confirmed that the cause of death was a stroke. But what was Juho doing in Nishiki's room, and what about this woman he was with? What if Reiko was that woman and she caused Juho to die "in the act"? Then why didn't she call a real doctor? Married couples stay at hotels. They would've stayed in Juho's favorite room, too. True. That's right! I forgot... Here it is! What's that? I think I'm on to something. I'm sorry to call you. What do you want? I see. Let's arrest them. Not yet. The fish are in our net. We just need proof to haul them in. Really? Strangers might mistake the two. I'll have them checked. Where's Akiko? Akiyama! I can't do it. You're the only one who can. Why me? Please? Let's go! Thank you kindly. It's a complimentary service we provide. I'll pay for the funeral services at the bank. Thank you. One more thing. Yes? About burying the ashes in the Lake Biwa plot. There's no rush. We agree. When we applied for a burial permit, we found out that area maybe be rezoned. Rezoned? We didn't want to see the grave dug up. So we recommend that you hold off on it. Isn't that Wakamizu Juho's brother Shinji in here? How did you know? She refused to talk until she speaks to you. Will you see her? Yes. I wanted to speak to her, too. That talk about rezoning was a trick. I wasn't sure, but that was the best place to hide the body. When did you suspect? The first time I saw the body at the hotel. People remove their glasses when they go to bed. But he was well-groomed, as if he were going out. When I suspected you and Nishiki Masaya of murder, I was on to something bigger. Master Juho's cause of death. Three doctors determined the cause of death. One of them, of course, was Nishiki. All three agreed it was a stroke, and as such, it didn't prove murder. But you still suspected us of murder. How? The doctors examined the body at different places. The family doctor and the medical examiner at the house, and Nishiki, the imposter, at the hotel. The real doctors examined Master Juho, who died of a stroke. But Nishiki examined his brother Shinji, who was poisoned. Master Juho and Shinji looked a lot alike. They're like twins. Really? Strangers might mistake the two. You and Nishiki used that to plan the murder. But you were too tricky. Tricky? The glasses. Master Juho's trademark was his tinted glasses. You figured no one would guess it was Shinji. But just in case, you put Master Juho's glasses on him. Master Juho preferred a pocket watch to a wrist watch with his kimono. But that body had on a wrist watch. Then there were the gray hairs on the pillow. You could tell the brothers apart by their hair. While Master Juho's hair was still black, Shinji's hair was graying. Wasn't it? Those hairs revealed that the brothers had different blood types. Ready to talk? Reiko... I've got someone that I love too. So I think I can understand. your feelings a little. You were being kept apart from Nishiki against your will. That was your feeling. Juho forced himself on me in front of him. The Wakamizu house was hell to me. Reviled as a gold digger after the master's fame and fortune, I tried many times to leave. But... You want to make a laughingstock of me? I won't let you! You're my property, like my glasses and my watch! You're an ornament, so act like one! Then one day... It was a three-year reunion and subsequently... I thought I recognized my brother's wife. Who's he? That's when he started blackmailing us. Shinji was once regarded a genius in dance. When he lost the Wakamizu headship to Juho, he successfully taught dance abroad. But he ruined himself through debauchery, and came back to Japan broke. Shinji kept demanding more. When he found out about Juho's poor health, he plotted to take over the Wakamizu headship. He obtained a drug to raise blood pressure, and urged me to switch it with the anti-hypertension medication. I hated Juho. But Shinji was no less despicable. So you conspired with Nishiki to get rid of both of them. We sold our souls to the Devil. After giving Juho the drug Shinji gave me. I offered to bathe with him. The drug was deadly. Confirming Juho's death, I contacted Nishiki and rushed to the hotel Shinji was at. Hurry up! You know the rest. When Shinji died, I called Nishiki. We dyed Shinji's hair. and covered up the smell with hair product. Then I got you to move his body to the house, where we switched it with Juho's body, and Nishiki took it away to bury. You must think of me as an evil woman. You're right about that. I'm a woman who killed two people. Whatever condemnation I get for it is inevitable. Reiko... But... I didn't do it to take over the school. I wished in fact that it would die. I did it for Nishiki and me. I just wanted to protect our love. Another day off ends up caught up in an incident. Sorry! No! That's how it is with us. Come to Tokyo. Leave undertaking to Akiyama. No way! Akiyama! I figured you'd be here. What is it? We're handling the funeral for Wakamizu Shinji. Good for you. Sorry. Maybe next time. I'm sorry, Haruhiko. It's hopeless. You monster! Cast KATAHIRA NAGISA WAKARAYASHI GO KANA AKIKO OMURA KON OMURA KON A funeral on a day off. A funeral on a day off.
