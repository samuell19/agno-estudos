Avast, you heathens. Here it comes. A woman! With unbound feet! She is a Hakka woman! Say nothing! Say nothing! Mr. Morris! Mr. Morris! The Chinese are killing each other. Come along, Mr. Morris. Break out the guns, Mr. Symes. Stand clear. How they told us in Macao we shouldn't mix Punti and Hakka together? The mountain people and valley people, Captain. They've hated each other for a thousand years. Punti or Hakka, they're all Chinese, and they all bring the same price on the dock in Honolulu. They won't bring us a damn dime dead at sea. Damn it! Who brought her aboard? What name you? Huh? Damn it, Morris, I said no women on board this ship. She looks none the worse for it. Would you like her topside, Captain? Who belong you? She belong me. She my wife. Well, damn your eyes. Did you pay her passage? Passage all paid. Name all same. Son of Ti Chong. You look contract. You see. Yeah, I'll do that. And I'll teach you not to try any more tricks too, you smart bastard! Nail up the hatch cover, Mr. Morris. No food and water for 24 hours. - Give them something to think about. - Aye aye, sir. You are Punti. She is Hakka. Is she your wife? No, I brought her aboard as my son. This terrible voyage... My wife made me come. My wife also expects me to return home rich. In Hawaii, we will receive three dollars a month. Promise me, if you die, I can have the girl to sell. No! No! She is not mine to give. I am delivering her to a brothel in Honolulu. Does she have experience? No. I stole her from a Hakka village in the mountains. She doesn't even speak Punti. What is her name? Char Nyuk Tsin. - Watch out, boy. - What for? He's already dead. Another piece of shark meat coming up. You'd think they'd know better. How many does that make? Seven altogether. It's expensive. I'd hate to lose money on my last voyage on the Carthaginian. You're sure it's your last, Captain? Your grandfather's not gonna like it when he gets to hear of this. Unless of course you're taking command of one of the newer ships. From now on, Mr. Morris, I'm shore bound. I've got a scheme bigger than anything the old man ever dreamed of. He'll love it. Well, we'll miss you, sir. The Carthaginian is a good ship. Maybe I can talk the old man into letting you have her. If we can keep enough Chinamen alive on this trip to turn a profit. I learn you Pidgin. You savvy? I learn you Pidgin. You savvy? Ship. You say. You say. Ssh... ip. Ssh... ip. Ssh... ip. - Ship! - Ship! Bed. - Bed. You say. - You say. Bed! Bed! Can you understand? You stupid Hakka. It says, "May this bed produce a hundred sons." With you, I may not have the spirit to father even one son! Pakes. Pakes. Move along. Move along. Pakes. There's a lot of things I'll miss about the sea, but that stink's not one of them. Can you spy my wife, Mr. Morris? No, sir. It's hard to make anything out with all that crowd seeing the lepers off. Come along now. Come on. Oh, but it's plain to see why you mean to quit the sea. Purity! Purity! Whip! He says her name is Char Nyuk Tsin. You change. You belong Island of Oahu. You are Prohilde. Next Pake. You boy. - Kee Mun Ki. - He says his name is Kee Mun Ki. Too long. We call you Kee. You belong Janders and Whipple, Island of Kauai. Next Pake. You boy. Psst! Psst! Psst! This the girl from the brothel of Spring Nights 'longside Macao? She Hakka! Want half my money back. She healthy? She not for sale. What the hell's going on here? Me buy woman. She belong me. You told me she was your wife. Sure, she my wife. See? Me buy. No want money. Me want woman. Whip, if she's his wife, you can't let them be separated. It's none of my business. I don't know who's cheating who. He cheat me. Me want woman. Whip. Whip. Couldn't they work for us? You bet. Me cook, whore house, 'longside, Macao. Plenty fine house. All right. We'll give it a try. You just bought yourself a wife. Maybe you're lying to him, but you'd better not be lying to me. Come on. Aloha little Pakes. Aloha! Aloha! This your house. Hey, sister, how about one drink? A fine house for my sons. Ship? Ship? No ship. House. No ship. House! Bed. By damn, some Pidgin, you learn pretty good. Whip. Whip, please don't go back to sea. I couldn't stand it. I won't. You know... We ought to have a regular Hoxworth shipping line with schedules, instead of just traps sailing here and there. If I can just convince the old man. We can make Honolulu the crossroads of the Pacific. Whip, your grandfather died six weeks ago. I didn't want to tell you until... Was that too selfish of me? No, I'm glad you didn't. It's like a main mast breaking. You don't believe it can happen until it does. Well, I didn't expect such a gathering of the clans. I thought the will had already been read. Hello, Malama. Why so glum! It must be the company you keep. It's good to have you back. I just wish you could have seen Grandfather once more. Cousin Micah. The will has been read, Whip. Some time ago. Perhaps you'll want to look it over privately. No. I'm only interested in the ships anyway. I imagine he left all the other businesses to Malama and you. Well, if you'll bother to read it, you'll see that he left the shipping business, all the businesses, to us. What the hell do you mean? You get Hanakai Plantation, Whip, free and clear. Hanakai? 85,000 acres of nothing! He always said it was the only mistake he ever... Did you put him up to this? I had nothing to do with this will. And if you think my wife did, you're wrong. I don't. The only thing I've ever held against Malama is marrying you. I loved that old son of a bitch. And he loved you. Whip. His mind was clear at the end, but he was obsessed about the old missionary families. He said they left all their sons rich, but he didn't have to do that for you, because you could make it on your own. He provided that you were to have an option to buy the Carthaginian out of earnings, if you chose to stick to the sea, which he advised. He wasn't married to Purity. Granted, Whip, but he may have known you better than you know yourself. Now, we are prepared to make an offer. For Hanakai? You name it. No, no, we agree that Hanakai has no value. But assuming that you don't want to accept favors from your sister, we will give you, not lend but give you, funds enough to buy the Carthaginian outright. I don't want a gift. And I don't want one stinking ship. I want a shipping line, a scheduled line. I want it enough to eat crow for it. All right, Micah, you've got the ships. Let me organize it, run it. Micah, that's a wonderful idea. But impractical. You've had no business experience. Besides which, you've been a hellraiser for too long to turn respectable now. So you're prepared to give me a ship just to get me out of here. - No thanks. - If this offer isn't enough, name your price. There's not enough money in this room to pay my price. I envy the pious. They can be bastards and never know it. Captain! The name's Overpeck, Captain. - What do you want? - I'm opportunity knocking at your door. I'm a well driller and I can make Hanakai bloom for you, sir. Like hell you can. My grandfather tried to find water up there for 20 years. I know all about it. He dug six wells. All down to caprock. All dry. - That's right. - Yeah, but, Captain? Caprock ain't deep enough. Look, the way I see it... Excuse me. You wouldn't have a drink in the house, would you, Captain? Come on in. You got a lovely place here, Captain. - Is that your grandfather there? - That's him. Oh, he's a fine figure of a man. Will you be going back to sea? The whole island knew about the will the minute after it was read. Coconut telegram. You're a queer bird to be in the water business. That's a fact. Look. These two volcanoes built this island. The lava flowed from the one, lava flowed from the other, overlapping, building up in layers. And you've got to be able to read them layers. - And you can? - Yes, sir. Like a chart at sea. And I've been reading Hanakai. I've got the only drill that can bust through that caprock on down to milk them layers. If it's so easy, why hasn't anybody tried it before? Because... Because these pious fools believe that if God intended them to have had water, he'd have installed bloody fountains. Where is this drilling rig of yours? In hock for $900. Look, if you're broke, make me a deal and I'll steal the rig back. I can get the money. What is the deal? A quart of whiskey and grub money for every day it takes. Too cheap. I was hoping you weren't all just hot air. Nice to have met you, Mr. Overpeck. Don't make a mistake. That was the price of a dry well. If I find water, and I will, I want three thousand acres of your land. Have a drink. Foo Sen very wise man. We do what he says, savvy? Savvy. Your horoscope is ready. It is most hopeful. This Hakka woman will bear you many sons. Your family genealogy indicates the child's name should be Kee Ah Chow. He shall control the continent of Asia. You gonna have boy. Him name Kee Ah Chow. Your later sons will be named after other continents, which the stars say they will control. For my wife in China. A mark of respect from her first son, yet unborn. You, girl. You understand me? The wife of Kee Mun Ki lives in China, in the Low Village. She is naturally the mother of all his sons. You will care for all of Mun Ki's sons until he returns with them to his wife in China. You understand? When baby come, I take care? Yes? When you are delivered of Mun Ki's son, his wife in China will change her name to "Mother of Wu Chow." The mother of five continents. How I called? Your name will become "Aunt of Wu Chow." The aunt of five continents. When baby come, I the auntie? 'Longside Chinaman, he bling baby. I bling very good. Him name Kee Ah Chow, all same, Asia. Asia? That little Pake? He'd better have broad shoulders. Pake's very strong. Pretty soon come Aflica, Amelica, Austlalia. Forget name other. Here. For luck. Whip, there's something... What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me? There's nothing wrong with you. Just hurry and have that baby so we can... Wu Chow's Auntie. I'd be deeply grateful if you could manage to... That is if you still have enough? Missy doesn't have any milk. - Missy sick? - No, no, no, she'll be all right. Milk will probably come in a day or two. Thank you, more than I can... Say, who told you you could start a garden here? Makee money. I sell in town. Don't you have enough work to do? I give you half. All right? What do you need money for? I'll see your family's fed. Take money. Buy land. Buy this land, maybe. You can't buy this land, it's practically in my parlor. Anyway, Chinese don't buy land. Chinese take money and go back to China. I never go back. All right. You grow what you can and anything you sell, you keep the money. I may need to borrow from you someday. Overpeck! Overpeck! Damn! Damn you scabby, rummy soul. Hello, love. Get out to that rig! Wu Chow's Auntie, you can take that food right back down the hill. That rummy traded the last batch you brought him for booze. He can damn well work hungry for a while. Food from garden, no cost nothing. Then take it in town and sell it. Pretty soon, water. Pretty soon, dry hole. Dry hole number four. Now, come on, get in here. Garden food belong me. You said. Any whiskey in there? What makes you so sure he'll find water? No sure. No sure 'longside China I come here. Have baby, have garden, 'longside great man, Hoxworth. I think pretty soon, water. What's the matter, honey? I don't know. Maybe it's too soon. You're fine, the baby's fine. Hell, it seems like a year to me. I don't want to stop you, but... Good night. Purity. What are you doing? Thinking back a thousand years or so. Thinking of the first canoes that came up all the way from Bora Bora. Why did our people come here, Whip? Our people? A little Hawaiian blood doesn't make us natives. It does if we want it to. There was no one here and they came thousands of miles. Who knows how many lives were lost in those little canoes. The missionaries, the whalers, the Chinese, it was easy for them. But not for our people. They were magnificent, Whip. It's coming, Whip, it's coming, I promise you. You've been telling me that for the last two years. It's coming, Whip. I can feel it, that's why I've got you here. I can hear it! Look, I've got the land and now I've got the water. The only difference between a sugar planter and me is money. Don't you want to see the black sheep of the family turn respectable? Oh, so you're not just asking for a loan? You're trying to blackmail us. That's right. I'll disgrace you all a lot less as a planter than a beachcomber. No. You'd just be broke again next year. There's not money enough in sugar to pay for irrigation. The water is free. But not the labor to dig ditches and keep them open. Whip, you know very well we'd have to foreclose. You're not a farmer and you're certainly not a businessman. I don't know whether sugar will pay there or not, but I know I've got something nobody else does. Artesian water and miles of land to put it on. That's got to be worth money sooner or later. Well, we can't see the "sooner" and we're not interested in the "later." Take my advice and go back to the sea. I'll see you in hell first and be damn glad of the trip. What's the matter, brother Micah, cat got your tongue? Pious bastards. Don't you care? Of course I care, but they're all pirates. They came here and took everything they could lay their hands on, you can't expect them to part with it. I sure as hell thought they'd fall off a few points in my direction. What will we do now? I don't know. I'll have to go back to sea, I guess. Whip, I don't want you to go. All right, I'll stay. By God, I'll stay. We'll lick them yet. I've got enough cash to plant a few acres of sugar. We can mortgage the house for enough to... Whip, we could sell the house. Yes, we could sell the house and just live. We don't need money. We could live the way our ancestors lived. - In a grass hut, on fish and poi? - Yes. - Listen... - Purity, you didn't marry some kanaki. You married me. - Remember, you love me. - Yes. And I love you, that's where it all began. I can't understand you. How could I? You haven't let me in your bed for six months. No. Whip. Whip, please. What is it? What's wrong? I don't know. Well, I know this. If I ever needed you, it's now. And all you can do is tell me to roll over on some beach and play dead. Nothing to worry about, Whip. Most little babies get cranky sometimes. No, it was just an excuse, it's Purity I really wanted you to see. Did you notice the way she is? Why all this ancient Hawaiian culture? That's what I'm talking about, she's filled the whole house with this stuff. I can't get near her. Thank you. Was it having the baby? Is that what did it? Oh, it may be kind of a post-natal depression, Whip, and then again it may not. Purity isn't just one quarter Hawaiian, Whip, she is one quarter royal Hawaiian. And you know how those high ranking families have been inter-marrying for thousands of years. You mean she's losing her mind? It's possible, Whip. Chick, chick. Come here, chicken. Come here, chicken. Here is my big fellow. Wu Chow's Auntie. You did a good job nursing Noel. I've got another baby for you. What kind baby that? Pineapple. From halfway around the world, French Guiana. French are so selfish that they don't want to export any. So I had a sailor friend of mine steal this seed plant and smuggle it out. It look dead, Captain. Yeah, just about. It'd take a green thumb like yours, you plant them right in among the vegetables, and nobody'll notice it and don't say a word. If you can make them grow and they still taste sweet, I'll go back to Guiana and smuggle out enough to plant at Hanakai. - We glow. - We glow. You come with me. Maybe, Captain Hoxworth loan us money. Money? For what? Buy little bit land. You like. I know. No good buy land 'longside this country. You want field? Buy field 'longside China. Want field here. I can't make this stubborn Hakka understand! Soon we... Will have all five sons! We must take them to their mother in China. No savvy Punti! You savvy Punti yesterday. Little bit, one word, maybe so. By damn, you learn savvy Punti. Too old! No smart. Pretty soon, my sons, they begin think they no Chinese. One year more, we go back 'longside China. One year. Where we live 'longside China? I take my sons, live 'longside my wife in Low Village. Where I going to live? You live 'longside your village. No! Want buy field 'longside here. Not buy field. Little god... If we return to China, I will lose my man. I will be lost and alone and nothing. Make this good man happy here. I, Char Nyuk Tsin, Wu Chow's auntie, ask you this. Asia! Aflica! This, you honor all your life. Your mother. Your true mother. 'Longside China. Remember. Her my wife. She look plenty nice, no? Wu Chow's Auntie. I can't wait any longer on this. Let's see what we've got. A little prayer to Confucius wouldn't hurt. Wu Chow's Auntie, you brought off a miracle. You grew a good pineapple. Oh, wait. Now, you've got something coming. Shall we go look at that littee-bittee land? What land? Bittee land up load. Man say hundred dollar. Captain, he say, I pay 20, maybe he lend 80. Eighty, hell! This is on me. Come on, make up your mind, you want it? I got to get to French Guiana before I go broke in that damn sugarcane. Yes, I want. Jesus shall reign Where 'er the sun Doth his successive Journeys run His Kingdom stretch From shore to shore Till moons shall wax And wane no more People and realms Of every tongue Dwell on His love With sweetest song What brings you here for the first time in your life? - Business. - Business. Well, we don't discuss business here. Why not? You've all gotten rich in the name of the lord. I want the Carthaginian for a year. It's impossible. You're as penniless as we said you'd be. Look, the will states I can sail the Carthaginian with an option to buy. I'll give up the option for the use of it. Well, brother Micah, what sayeth the lord? And all the sons Of want are blest Amen At 10:07 and 12 seconds, Mr. Symes. Forty two degrees, eight minutes and 22 seconds. Too much dish. - You burn? - No. No. I look this hand. It no hurt? Leprosy. You got medicine for Mai Pake? You get medicine? But no like Chinese doctor. - I like see Dr. Whipple. - No, no! He send me Molokai! Never! You savvy. Never! I heard about bad Chinese man, lots of man. They tell police about Mai Pake. Police pay money. I think Chinese doctor, bad Chinese man, they both same that. What we do when money run out? Kee Mun Ki. You know I no like go back China. But maybe so better. My China wife see me leper? Never! Never! 'Longside China all same. Wu Chow's Auntie. You good woman. By damn, you good woman. What don't we get the mosquitoes to carry the bloody pineapples? Keep it quiet, there may be patrol boats along here. - Got him! - Damn your eyes, Conroy. I said no shooting! Morris, pick him up. Glendar, take his place. Stand by to give way together. Oars out! All right, work as fast as you can, but quiet. Any man comes out of that field without a full sack gets left behind. Good morning. Now it is time for my preparation number 41. How much this time? Very special formula. $15. $15? No got $15. You have a vegetable patch. You could sell. No. I got five sons. Patch for sons. Then I'm afraid your friend cannot be cured. No cure anyway. Medicine no good. Better I go see Dr. Whipple. A white doctor? He will sell your friend to the police. Pig! Liar! You sell to police already! Go after her. - You folks know where he stay? - No, they go. They no say where. - Where are kikis? - Not come home from school yet. - Where Mrs. Hoxworth? - She gone, she went other side of the island. You folks listen, if those two Pakes come back, you tell us. Sure! Better sleep now. You sleep. I no sleepy. Funny thing. I sick, but no feel sick. Everybody aflaid me, but I feel all same day we come Honolulu. Maybe more better you aflaid, too. No. Better we go. No chance unloading tonight, Captain. I don't worry about that, we'll unload this cargo ourselves. Purity! - Captain. You home. - Where's Missy? She gone. I don't think she come back. Captain, little Pake's in bad trouble. You come help, please? What we do, Captain? Help me get him in the buggy. Poor little Pakes. Kee Mun Ki. Aloha, Mun Ki. Aloha, little Pake. All kokuas aboard! All kokuas aboard! Kokuas, what they? They not got Mai Pake. Husband, he go take care wife. Wife, she go take care husband. They stay there. Not come back. I kokua. I go. I help Mun Ki. You got babies. You take care these baby. I go take care Mun Ki. Wu Chow's Auntie, you can't go there. Last call for kokuas! I go. I help Mun Ki. I go. Please! Aloha. Aloha. Aloha. Ready to make sail! Stand by to cast off! Kee Mun Ki. You take me with you? One more time? This time, I learn Punti. All right. Everybody out. You hear me. Everybody out. Come on. Come on. Lively, now. Off you go. Look, I came here to see you. Purity, I want you to come home with me. But this is my home. I belong here. You belong with me. If you really mean that, stay here. By God, if I thought... Listen to me. Whatever's been wrong between us, is it over? Purity, do you want me? I don't know. By God, there's one way to find out. Whip, please put me down. Whip, please put me down. Please put me down! Put me down! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're trying to trick me! You're trying to trick me! All right. But I'm taking Noel back with me. Noel belongs here with his people. These aren't his people. He's my son. Whip! Whip! Here, you take him. Captain Hoxworth! Captain Hoxworth, you got Mai Pake? No, no. No, by God. If I did, they'd have to kill me to get me out here. What about you? She no got Mai Pake yet, she strong woman. Mun Ki. I got your message. Captain, better you take baby. Go quick. Solly, baby, she girl. Well, place for girls in the world, too. Is she weaned? She no have name. You ask Foo Sen for good name, please? Sure. I better go. Good luck. Noel. - Dad? - Hmm. Is it true you killed a man when you got the pineapples? Killed him in cold blood? Where did you hear that? School. Is it true? Yes, it's true. What else do they teach you at that school? Ever tell you I was the one that found water in this island so they could raise the damn pineapples? No. All they're saying is that the pineapples have blood on them. You really don't know whether your old man's a son of a bitch or not, do you, son? Still wanna go to sea? Yes, sir. All right. You'll go to sea. See what you'll learn there. Maybe you can figure out for yourself whether those pineapples are worth the blood. Send half to our mother in China. Hold the rest for Kee Mun Ki. Asia, each year your Punti gets worse and worse. How is your father? It has been long since we have heard anything about him or Wu Chow's Auntie. And your sister, did you name her Mei Li as I instructed? Yes, and will you please tell our mother in China? And will you also tell her we're going to build a house of our own by the vegetable patch. A house? You are ambitious. A pity that your Punti is so poor! Go, go, go, go. - Those aren't Chinee. - Japanee. They're a lot tamer than the Chinee. Work cheaper, too. Well, it's time for you to get along. Need anything? I don't know, Dad. Well, if you get in trouble just... You just get yourself out. Bye, Father. Say, what the hell's going on here? They just finished it last week. Pretty good job. - On whose time, mine? - No, sir. And they paid for every penny's worth of material they used. Was I you, Captain, I wouldn't put up a stink. Bathing is a kind of a religion with these Japanee. It's hotter than Port Said in the summer today. Give me a hand with these. You supposed to give this fellow some money? He makes the soap, or his wife does. But I reckon you'll be on the house. You speakie Pidgin? No? No fellow speakie Pidgin? My name Fumiko. I speak. Fumiko, you don't need to speak. In Japan, I work in custom house. I speak many language pretty good. Why are you working here as a field hand? He writes me marriage proposal and I come here. He not very respectable man. He very bad. You see, Hawaii not like what I think. No work for respectable Japanese girl except field hand. I think maybe you help. Help you do what? Find someone to marry you? I don't think that's much of an idea. You've got a wife already? My wife doesn't live with me. Men like you have plenty woman. That's not true. Man like you does not need a Fumiko. You don't know anything about a man like me. Wu Chow's Auntie! But they said you weren't allowed to leave Molokai. Captain Hoxworth, he get me back. You, Asia? No, Africa. Africa. - Europe? - That's right. America, Australia. - Where Asia? - Asia's at his restaurant. Restaurant. That's good. What her name? Mei Li. The name given her by Foo Sen. - Are you a leper? - No, no. Wu Chow's Auntie, do you think you can climb the ladder to your house? - My house? - I'll help you. Have you got Mai Pake? No. But every night, I look. Now you, me got secret, understand? Africa smart. Much study. Better he be lawyer. But he can't be. They don't want any Chinese lawyer here. Five sons. Why Kee Mun Ki have five sons? So the House of Kee be big and strong. 'Longside China big, strong family always have lawyer. But they won't teach me here. I'd have to go to America. You go America. But with all the money we send to our mother in China, we could never afford it. So, we make more money! Restaurant too little. Make bigger. Garden too little, make bigger. But we haven't any more land. We get more land. I'm sorry. It's impossible. Impossible come back from Molokai. Well, brother Micah, what do you think of our new Queen? She's a proud, strong woman. Some of us think she's got herself confused with the Queen of England. You think you can handle her? Or should we be pushing somebody else for Secretary of State? I doubt that you would succeed. She knows I have served three monarchs loyally. My loyalty is to my pocketbook. I hope you can protect it. Just may be that this monarchy is becoming a luxury the islands can't afford anymore. Can I give you a lift? No, thank you. I'd prefer to walk. To the Kee farm. I don't care if you buy it. Hell, I'll even lend you the money. The Queen won't stand for it. That piece belongs to an Hawaiian family. She won't let Hawaiians sell their land. - To white man? - To anyone. Except Hawaiians. Do you know this Hawaiian family? Wu Chow's Auntie, it won't do you a bit of good. I still like meet this Hawaiian family. Frankly, Brother Micah, as Prime Minister you aren't worth spit in a windstorm. What were you doing when this comic opera queen tore up our constitution, anyway? Praying? She's given herself the power to confiscate every acre and damn every dollar we've got. I couldn't stop her, but I believe it's just a gesture to prove her independence. Gesture! She wants every white man out of Hawaii. She's trying to drive these islands back to the 16th century. She is simply trying to protect herself and her people. Can you deny that for years you and a lot of others have financed a press campaign to promote the American annexation of Hawaii? - Well, why should I deny it? - Fine. I'll tell you something else. For the past six months a group of us, in the family, Micah, have been buying up every firearm in Hawaii, including some from the Queen's own arsenal. Actually, for a bunch of amateur revolutionaries, we've done pretty well. Whip, you must wait. What for? Until we lose everything we've got? I will not participate in this ungodly scheme. Do you want to see your relatives shot for treason? No, you've gotta be our white knight. I tell you I will not be party to a revolution. I'll supply the revolution, - you be the father of your country. - Never! And I don't intend to let you drag the family down either. You know, there's only one thing worse than a successful revolution, and that is an unsuccessful one. Sit tight, Brother Micah, and await your call to greatness. It's coming, believe me. Tired? Tired? Hell, no. More? I never know whether you do that because you love me, because it's the custom, or just to keep the furniture clean. No one ever come here. You'd better see who it is. I'm Lieutenant Keholo. I know Whipple Hoxworth is here. You're under arrest, sir. Am I? What's the charge? Violation of the Defense of the Realm Act. Treason. You are taking me to jail? Yes, sir. Fumiko. You go to the American minister. Give him this. He'll know what to do. Anytime you're ready, Lieutenant. After you, sir. Hey, hold it. Well, what are you doing here? Captain Hoxworth, you in trouble. You'd better get out of here or you'll be in trouble. You need money, maybe? No thanks, Wu Chow's Auntie. I don't need money, maybe. Captain Hoxworth is an American citizen, ma'am. For far too long, the whites have claimed whatever citizenship suited them at the moment. It is particularly convenient when there happens to be two American warships in the harbor. Apparently, you suspect some sort of a conspiracy. Let me ask a hypothetical question. Suppose an uprising did occur and failed? The rebels would be beheaded. What! I'm sorry. I put it poorly. I meant a bloodless uprising. It is the custom of the islands. He who acts against the throne is beheaded. But, ma'am, if Americans are involved, prominent Americans. Ma'am, you've traveled all over the world. You're familiar with civilized custom. Mr. Houghton, what you call civilized custom has been more cruel to these islands than beheading a few greedy men. If you have any influence over these men, I suggest you use it. This is all hypothetical, of course. I'm sure you intend to release Captain Hoxworth soon. I intend to execute him, Mr. Houghton. Ma'am, you can't be serious! I'm sure Captain Hoxworth is serious. Why shouldn't I be? He must have a trial, ma'am. This a government founded upon law. This is a government fighting for its life. Are you with it or against it, Mr. Hale? Good evening, ma'am. We are dealing with men who hope to buy a revolution. Will they be so eager when they see that they must pay for it with their lives? Whip, this uprising must stop. You must call it off. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do about it now. I'm afraid they've already started the ball rolling. I thought it was all talk and I still think it is. Let me speak to them. Mr. Hale, you have great influence with many people, so much so that they speak of you as Hawaii's first president after my fall. They do so without my consent. Your influence could be decisive if it is crystal clear that you stand shoulder to shoulder with me, no matter whom it hurts. This man is guilty by his own admission. Are you prepared to concur in the sentence? It is barbarous. Not if it saves other lives. Yes or no? Time is short. Yes or no, Mr. Hale? No, Your Majesty. Ma'am, sailors and Marines are in the city and they're already on the palace grounds. As God is my witness, it was none of my doing. Then this is a sad day for both of us, for only God will believe you. Well, congratulations, Mr. President. How does it feel to be the father of your country? Now we're finally annexed and Brother Micah is a $10,000 chunk of art. The Hawaiians think he was a hell of a fellow. How many Hawaiians have forgiven you, Father? Whose side are you on? Let's just say I think I understand your viewpoint. By the way, what was that Hoxworth and Hale sign I saw coming up from the dock? Oh, since Micah died, your Aunt Malama and I have gone into one or two little things together. Ignition. Spark. Sounds like I've come back to a tidy little empire. Does it scare you? It might if I were committed to it. You've got a nice touch with that razor. Why don't you ask what a pretty girl like me is doing here? All right. What's a pretty girl like you doing here? Shaving you. Is that supposed to stop me? Yes. Do you know I once worked as bodyguard for the Empress of China? Do you know he walks me home every evening? And he carries a pistol? Then how about lunch? If I can choose the restaurant. Why not? Good Lord, Mei Li. Does the whole Kee family live here? Of course. All my brothers are married now. Why should it surprise you? When I think about it, I've got to agree with the Chinese. White people live and die alone. Don't forget. We're having lunch tomorrow. I won't. Pistol, you and I are going to be seeing a lot of each other. What do you say we go have a drink. Why not? Forgive me, but you forget how fortunate you have been in having five sons. A daughter is a far different matter. Matter? No matter. Wong family want too much dowry last year, want too much this year. Mei Li is not getting any younger. Time is on the side of the Wong family. Wongs got only two sons and one not smart. With Mei Li, they get five more sons, all smart. I say good bargain. They very wealthy. They know the connection can be of benefit to you. Together you will be as rich and powerful as all the old white families. No family rich with only two sons, one not smart. They ask ten city lots, I think they take six. But they refused that when Mei Li was a year younger. Seven. I will try it. Quick. Him very sick. Take him away before police come. Quick. All right, I'll put out a couple of cases of rat poison if that's what you want. No! Captain Hoxworth. Put them on the desk, Stewart, I'll check them later. Three cases of bubonic plague reported in Chinatown. That's not surprising. I never saw a worse pesthole in China. Your shacks are no better than the rest. I understand you've been seeing something of that pigsty the Kee family lives in. They could afford a palace. Well, likely as not they'd have it, if it weren't for the old lady. Just watch what you say about that old lady. While we're on the subject, stay the hell away from her daughter. I've seen Mei Li exactly 12 times and I haven't been alone with her yet. What are you getting out of it then? I enjoy being with her. She's the only thing that's kept me here. What do you mean by that? I suppose I mean that I love her. All right. Live with her then, but keep quiet about it. You carried that girl back from Molokai when she was six months old. I plan to marry her. Here, have a drink. No, thanks. I've never tried to be easy on you, but there's no point in making life any tougher than it's got to be. Have a drink. You know there isn't a club in this town that'll let me in the front door. I can't remember the last time I was invited into a private house. Well, I don't give a damn and I never have. But maybe you would. No, Wu Chow's Auntie, I like Mei Li, I just don't like the idea of this marriage. If they go through with it, they'll both be sorry. You know all the reasons why as well as I do. I know reasons. I against it, too. I can't stop it, but maybe you can. Captain Hoxworth, he no like marriage either. But it's Noel who did the proposing. No Hoxworth has ever broken his word to us yet. And he isn't even asking for a dowry. Marry Wong boy, marry whole family. Marry Hoxworth, marry one sailor. At least he speaks our language. He speak Hakka? Hmm. Only Punti. If this plague gets worse, what will happen to our business? The city lots the Wongs want are worth cash money. And we may need the cash. Now you hear me. Captain Hoxworth my friend, so his son my friend, but they white. No think like Chinee. No have five sons, one daughter, fourteen grandsons, ten granddaughters. No think about time when they be married to families that be all same one family and spread and spread forever. That what Mun Ki and I talk about on Molokai. That what make Mun Ki live forever. Hawaiian family understand, but white family, no! Wongs want ten lots, we pay ten lots. Hold it, hold it. All your clothes have to be burned. Hold up, sir. They're going to burn the house down. They found a dead man in there. They say it's the plague. This place belongs to Hoxworth and Hale. You go see Dr. Whipple. He's over there. Thank God somebody talks their language. Tell this woman I've got to burn these household effects as well. First, you tell me. Have you got a permit? No, damn it, I don't, but I know plague when I see it. If that's your property, sue me, but first, talk to that woman. Don't talk to me about poison, the rats laugh at it. Two solid blocks of pestilence here and our only chance is to burn them down. You talk mighty freely about burning other people's property. I'm sorry, Mr. Janders. He's right. Do you want a plague that could cover this entire island or do you want to save lives? Very noble, Dr. Whipple, but not very damn practical. Chase these people out of here, hold them in quarantine and we can get this filth cleaned up. And in a little time, we can get rid of the rats too. It's too late for that. By the time we got the dirt and the fleas cleaned up, we'd have a hundred more of those on our hands. Simmons, can you even get fire engines in here? Some places yes, most places no. Then you're running a risk of setting the whole city afire. You start anything like that, boy, I can get a court injunction to stop you. Don't think I won't. Let me have your attention. Anyone who wishes to enter the area must pass medical inspection. Repeat. Anyone wishing to enter must pass inspection. You know damn well the quarantine hasn't worked. There are hundreds of people hiding in those shacks. If we wait any longer, they will all be infected. So you wanna burn them up? We won't burn anybody. I'm asking you to get that injunction called off. Either you get rid of it or the doctors and I are going to the governor. What the hell does that governor know about it? He's from Chicago. He never even saw Hawaii until six months ago. You know these islands have managed to stay afloat since long before your great-granddaddy got here. I guess we can keep them from sinking under the Americans. They've provided a pretty good way of life for you. Yes, sir. First at the expense of the Hawaiians and now the Chinese. I'm talking about the plague. What do you expect the governor to do about it? I'll show you. Hey, you're getting quite a kick out of this, aren't you, boy? Oh, yeah. I'm having the time of my life. You know, it's a life's work just to make this island paradise of yours fit to live in. Damn right. Left. Left. Left. Platoon, halt. Open up. - Yes? - Get your stuff out. We're going to dynamite this building to clear a firebreak. I don't understand. The governor declared martial law. You have ten minutes. Keep moving. Africa! Look out for those burning piece! Go this way! Go this way! We can't save it. Well, that's the end of that. Everybody move back. Move back. Chop, chop. I can't hold it anymore. The whole place is about to go! Well, Dr. Whipple, I suppose you're happy now. Where's Wu Chow's Auntie? - The Chinese won't leave. - They're hiding everywhere! Make way for the fire wagon! Make way! Wu Chow's Auntie. I've been over half Honolulu looking for you. You've got to come back to Chinatown with me. The fire is worse, and the old people won't leave. They're frightened, they don't know any English. I speak only Hakka. At least it's Chinese. God damn it all. She's with me. Mei Li. Come with me. Get some water over here. Quick! Hey, she said the government will pay them. It won't. Quiet. It's no time for details. Where have you been? - Looking all over for you. - Take him. He's heavy. You stay with me. There should be $458 here. And we owe $96,000. Well, it looks like we're more than broke. No sell vegetable patch. I guess we were squeezing too many people in here. I have to admit it. It's better off gone. You no broke. I'm better off than I was before. I've got enough cash to buy some of this land for what it'll bring now. Dirt cheap. Guess the Chinee will hate me for that. What about you? I never hate you, Captain. You know, if Mei Li were to marry Noel, it might help heal a lot of wounds. No good. Hoxworth, up here. Kee down there. But I know what you really think. Hoxworth down there, Kee up there. You know Mei Li supposed to marry Wong boy. The smart one. You never cared much for being Auntie to your own children, did you? But at least you had the man you wanted. Ah, never mind. I guess you can't let your daughter marry a white boy. I'll still have to let you borrow whatever cash you need. - $96,000? - Ninety-six thousand? And enough more to buy little bit more land while still dirt cheap. And Mei Li marry Noel. You know, Wu Chow's Auntie, I'm a damn lucky man. At my age, I've still got a goal in life. To keep you from getting my shirt. Wu Chow's father, I know you bothered Mei Li marry white man, but I ask you remember all sons have married well as you could hope. Asia, he have six children. Africa, seven. Australia, he have five and another come soon. Europe, you remember we worried about him, well, he have two, both same time.
