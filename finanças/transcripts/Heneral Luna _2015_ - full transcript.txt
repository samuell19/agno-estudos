General? - My name is Joven Hernando, sir. - Joven? The commander's son. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. It's okay, General. I am honored to interview you. What is this for again? We plan to publish a newspaper. - Like what you did with... - La Independencia. Yes, sir. We want to continue what you started. It's only fitting that our first article should be about you, General. You might end up with a novel. Have a seat. What do you think? My brother Juan designed this. I paid for it myself. Our army has limited funds but... we must show the Americans that we are respectable. Fall in! Who sent these? These are the new uniforms from General Luna, sir. What new uniforms? We already have uniforms. General Luna came up with a single design to unify the whole army. Why do I have to follow him? It was also ordered by President Aguinaldo. It's good that our soldiers' uniforms finally have one design. It's hard work bringing together a divided nation, Joven. Word is that the Cabinet is about to make a decision about the Americans? It's easier for the earth to meet the sky, Joven, than for two Filipinos to agree on anything. Mr. President! This will take us nowhere. The Americans are gathering forces as we speak. Let's attack now while they are few. Even if we suffer large casualties, we can drive them out of Manila and take control of Intramuros. We have control over nearby provinces! We have 40,000 men! There are only 3,000 Americans. We can easily drive them away! I have sent Arguelles and Buencamino as our peace commissioners to General Otis. They are toying with us. My informants tell me they are expecting 7,000 armed troops that will strengthen their forces. Sir. See? General Luna is right! We must act now! America is also an enemy of Spain. An enemy of my enemies is my ally. - Yes. - Yes. America fought Spain in Cuba. Did they invade Cuba? No. They even helped the Cubans kick out the Spaniards. We have nothing to fear. Let's give peace a chance. What a sissy. Well said, Mr. Paterno. This has to be a concerted effort, Joven. Everyone who came before us gave their lives for freedom. If Spain is America's enemy, why haven't they joined us? Why are they stopping us from storming Intramuros? I agree with Mr. Paterno. - I choose peace. - You are blind. Instead of sitting here all day, we could be out there, gathering arms, digging trenches, and training our men to fight. Do not believe the sweet words of the Americans! There is no room for blindness in this Cabinet! What about our businesses? If we fight, the economy will be in shambles. How can we feed our families? Business or freedom? Country or yourself? You choose! I know you. You were with the Spanish Civil Government, and when things went bad for Spain, you changed camps. Now that things are rough for us, you'll switch to the American flag? Enough. We all have our interests. We're only human. How can anyone talk of business when we are all slaves in our own country? - I love my country as much as you do. - Bullshit! For now, America is our ally. They gave me their word in Hong Kong. They will do anything to compete with other nations who want to colonize us. Let us wait for the Treaty of Paris to be completed. Do we have delegates in Paris? Or any observers, at least? You're like virgins who believe in the love of a whore! Tell our countrymen that freedom is not achieved by protecting their loved ones. They have to pay the price. - What is the price? - Blood and sweat. They have to jump into the abyss. Mr. President. I apologize for my outburst. Everyone's suspicions are well-founded. It's not wrong to wait, but it's also not wrong if General Luna were to strengthen our military forces. Gentlemen, let us pray for peace, but prepare for war. Gentlemen. The Americans fired on our troops in Sta. Mesa. How did that happen? They have taken San Juan, Paco and Pandacan, and other nearby towns. And they're holding negotiations with the Spaniards in Intramuros. Negotiations? How did that happen? Buencamino! Arguelles! Manila has fallen. The city is in their hands. General Luna. It's up to you now. The war is in your hands. What do you want me to do? Bite them? Would these patriots help me? Let's go! Buencamino, how did this happen? What can we do? We didn't talk to them sooner. It is a great honor to fight for our country. We should not hesitate. Forward, compatriots. To conquer or die. Concentrate your fire! Do not waste bullets! Fire! Fire! Aim properly! Don't waste your bullets. No retreat! Fire! Fire! General! General! The left flank is in danger! General! Send a message to our men in Kawit. Tell Captain Janolino to reinforce the left flank. The enemy must not break through. Do not be afraid! Fire all together. Don't despair! General, that would be easier if there were more of us alive. The Kawit troops are on their way. Oh, man! Hey! Where are you going? Get back here, you cowards! Hey! The women here have bigger balls than you. Get back here! You? Come here. Are you Buencamino's son? Stand and fight! Fight! Bullshit! Son of a bitch! Keep fighting! Don't give up! To the death! - Don't move. - General. - I'm sorry... - Stop talking. Rusca! - Sir? - Get him to the rear. - Call the medic! - Medic! Medic! Hurry up. Get him out of here. Lieutenant. For gallantry in the field of battle, I hereby promote you to colonel, in the name of the Philippine Army. General... Get him out of here. Thank you. Wait. Put him down. - What's the news? - Colonel. Captain Janolino refuses to obey. General! Look for Berto. What's the word from Kawit? The Kawit Brigade refuses to obey. Captain Janolino says he has no direct orders from the President. Paco! Get my horse. Rusca, you stay here. Hold this line! You can do it. General! Someone's coming! Fall in! Hurry! Look at these idiots. Where is Janolino? Your comrades are dying and you're just playing cards! Where's your captain? Stand properly when the General is talking! He's inside. - Román. - General? Disarm these cowards. Strip them of their ranks and tie them up. Son of a bitch! Good afternoon, Captain. You bastard! How's your nap? General... You understand Spanish and Tagalog, don't you? Yes, sir. Well, you son of a bitch, why didn't you obey my orders? Do you know how many men are dead and wounded because of your stupidity? I only take orders from President Aguinaldo. Do you know Article One of our rules and regulations? No, sir. Article One: "Any person who refuses to follow the orders of the General will be stripped of their ranks and will be executed without trial." That's you, brother. You poor men of Kawit. Your leader has his brain in the wrong head. By the feel of it, his brain isn't that big. Back to battle. Keep them coming! When you run out of bullets, come over and I'll crush your white balls together! We can't beat them. Shut up. Hey, stay low! Keep your... Son of a bitch! Come back here! Son of a bitch! Go back there! Hurry! - Get your guns! - Serves you right. Don't despair! Stand fast! Fire! Fire! General! General! General! Don't! Cover the General! Charge! Forward, men! General! Fire! General, no! Why did you stop me? Don't you see? - Hey! You stupid Americans! - General, get down! General, look. For the motherland! Charge! They're retreating! Long live the Philippines! Long live! This is not a victory, Paco. I know, General. But look at them. Viva! They're now real soldiers and they need you. He humiliated my captain in front of his men. You said we should take orders from you only. We can't afford to lose more men. Don't worry, Tomas. They will all be reinstated. Thank you, Mr. President. We have to do something about that crazy Luna. He humiliated us Caviteños. They are my men. My men from Kawit. I know they need discipline, but the way he carried it out... Whatever we say, the fact is Luna is useful. I don't understand him. - What do we do with him? - Support him. We still share the same goals. Is there anything we can do? And his arrogance? Have you tried catching air? They say that you are a warmonger. Why not compromise? Wouldn't that be easier? I detest war, Joven. But to compromise? Can we simply ignore the enemy? The Americans are not going to stop soon, Paco. Our forces will eventually run out. That is why we have to prepare for our last stand. The plan is clear, General. These trenches we're planning to dig north of Bagbag River will hold up. But the trenches from Caloocan to Novaliches are more important. While the Americans are busy fighting, we will retreat North. - General. - Yes? First, we do not have enough men to dig a trench line that long. We need at least 2,000 volunteers with shovels and pickaxes to start with. Second, I don't think the President will agree to such ambitious plan, especially the trench line from Caloocan to Novaliches. - Three days. - Sir? Give me three days. Major. Captain. The Americans know why we have to fight for our liberty, because they also fought ferociously for theirs. Are we different from them? Do we not have the same right to liberty? That's why their aggression toward us is inexcusable. Fall in! Start. Article One: "Any person who refuses to follow the orders of the General will be stripped of their ranks and will be executed without trial." Ready? I'm sorry, General. Are we going home? Three more camps to visit. - With all due respect, sir. It's midnight. - Then ride fast, brother. General. General. - Good morning, Paco. - You look like you came from battle. - Breakfast? - Yes. There's breakfast ready. Not for me. For them. Two thousand? Four. Four? Halt! Captain. Thank you for the help. We had no choice. He threatened to shoot us all if we didn't go with him. Some of the men have begun calling him General Article One. General, we need to send men and ammunition to Bataan. I have three reserve platoons in Bulacan. They can ride tomorrow. With all due respect, but they need to reach Bataan before Sunday. Our men cannot fly, Paco. - Take command, General. - What are you going to do? I will get us a train. General, do you know how to speak English? Excusez moi. There! Over there! He says you're crazy. My English is running out. Arrest him already, damn it! Go on! Quickly! How dare you talk to me in English in my own country! This tea would go better with ensaimada. - General. - Is everything ready? We have a problem. The Americans? No, sir. Our officers. They invited their families on the train for sightseeing. There is no room for the troops. Damn it! Ensaimada is better with that. Excuse me. Excuse me. Out of my way! Idiots! We're not going sightseeing! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! That was a big headache. That's just how Filipinos are. Family comes first. That's our biggest fault. We risk our lives for our families. But patriotism? There are only a few patriotic soldiers I've met in my life. I remember one fight in Malabon. The fighting had stopped around dinner time. There was an American colonel who was having dinner in a house. Let's see who amongst our men are brave enough. I'm giving you a chance to prove our army's worth. Who wants to attack the enemy? They're having dinner. There is a colonel inside a house in the western side of town who's a sitting duck at this moment. Any volunteers? Do we have no patriots here? Is there no one willing to die for this country? Name? Garcia, General. There are only a few men like Lieutenant Garcia. One who's willing to give everything for his country. Why don't you let Garcia just shoot the officer? It's enough for them to know that we are not afraid of them. - Long live the Philippines! - Long live! Put Garcia in the sharpshooters. He's qualified. - Long live the General! - Long live! If only Filipinos were like him. There are many like him. Not enough, Joven. Come in. General. It's time. Let's continue this tomorrow, Joven. Thank you, General. Several drunk men made a scene in town last night. There was a scuffle, so we had to arrest them. One of them was your brother. - Who? - Joaquin, sir. I bet it was over a woman. The mark of a true Luna. Dr. Rizal and l almost got into a duel because of a woman. So l heard from Paco. Is Joaquin in jail? - Yes. He kept yelling he's your brother. - Leave him there. Be careful, General. This is going to be tough. I know. What took you so long? Were you seen? I've always been discreet. Don't laugh. I have more to lose. I am a woman of marrying age. And from a prominent family, in love with an Indio. You are not an Indio. Your family is rich. But I'm right. You love me. Bastard. I'm thirsty. Am I not enough to satisfy your thirst? What happened? Work. Were you shot? Why is it that after making love, you start acting like my mother? You got shot. Just a scratch. This is not a scratch. Now you sound like a nagging wife. Antonio. The war is your wife. I'm just a mistress. - Hey, it's cold. - Go to hell. Everyday I'm in hell when I'm not with you. Liar. You think... I enjoy fighting? Yes, because you are a sadist. The war is not my wife. It's the cross I bear. So this is where it ends? Isabel. We can't keep seeing each other again like this. Is that it? Correct. We do not have time for things we cannot hold onto. Our duties in this war are more important than our feelings for each other. The next time we see each other, you are a soldier, and I... a woman of the Red Cross. Isabel. General. Mr. President. Mr. President, the Schurman Commission wants to meet with us - to discuss some terms. - Terms? - There are no terms! - What do you mean, no terms? Wait! Quiet! Let him speak. They are offering some kind of autonomy for the Republic. To be a protectorate under America. - That would be treason! - That would not happen. According to our constitution, sovereignty rests only with the Filipinos. You're a traitor for proposing annexation. I am not proposing it. I am merely reporting it. How can you trust him? He worked for the Spanish government. With people like these, we don't need enemies. America is the strongest nation in the world. Think of the advantages for trade and economy. How long are we going to keep fighting? Many have died. We are short on money, arms, - and supplies. - But not in spirit. My men are committed. Even Dr. Jose Rizal... How can this assembly consider something this treasonous? - Are you calling me a traitor? - And a coward. I remember I saw your son in battle. He deserted his post while his comrades lay dying. There are no cowards in my family. My son never joined you in battle, so you have no right to insult my family, Antonio. I was not insulting you. I was stating the fact that treason and cowardice runs in the family. You're like your brother Juan. Had he been in the country, he would have been executed for murdering his wife. You are true to your name. Luna... Lunatic! Enough! Stop you two! Enough! That's enough! Calm down! Enough! By the authority granted by the Philippine Republic, I order the arrest of this traitor. And you too. Why me? It's within his authority. Captain, Major, arrest Buencamino. Colonel, Román. Come with me. I am not a traitor! - This is unconstitutional! - Just come with me. And you shut up! If we are to become one nation, we must go through a radical change. Brothers, we have an enemy bigger than the Americans. Ourselves. Fresh fruits and vegetables! Fresh fruits and vegetables! Fresh fruits and vegetables! Sir! Stop right there! Sir? Don't move. General, do you want to buy a chicken? Don't move. Do as he says, old man. Sir, what have I done? Just keep quiet. I can give you half price for the chickens. Tell him to shut up. Okay. I'll give them for free. That's what I'll do to traitors. I will not hesitate. No one is above the law. Not even the President. - General, people might hear you. - Let them hear. Have mercy, sir. Please don't hurt me. Have mercy, sir. Hush now. Apologies. For your trouble. Have chicken for dinner. Thank you so much, sir. A true son of liberty will never allow themselves to be tied up like dogs. They are worse than Americans, those who place their self-interests first, those who pledge allegiance only to their regions and their tribes. That is proof that we are not ready to rule ourselves. - I hope this fucking war ends already. - I agree. I really don't care if the Americans win the war, - as long as it's good for business. - Exactly. No, thanks. My fiancé has invited me to Paris. - You're moving there? - Yes. After the wedding. You're so lucky. Everybody wants to leave. How many men arrived? About a thousand and a half, from Pangasinan and Ilocos. Lieutenant Manuel Quezon brought us about 400 men from Tayabas. Everyone goes to you now that Bonifacio is gone. Procopio! Mr. President, I will go ahead. Where are you going? To Arayat. There's a feast I have to attend. Still thinking about Andres Bonifacio? I'm afraid it might happen again. Our defenses are up for the three camps. Here in Bagbag, Pulilan, and with General del Pilar's troops in Quinga. But we still need more troops. Send a telegram to General Mascardo. Tell him to send more troops to Quinga and here in Bagbag. Sir, General Mascardo is headed for Arayat. Why? He didn't say. But there's a feast today in Arayat. General Mascardo. A telegram from General Luna. - What does it say? - He's ordering you to return Bagbag. Additional troops are needed. I just got here and he wants me to leave? He also said there's no time for festivities. Look at that Luna's arrogance. You'd think he wasn't talking to a fellow general. Tell him I didn't come for the feast. I have to inspect our troops here in Arayat. I'll return to Bagbag when I'm done. While the Americans advance, our troops will slowly retreat to a fortress in the Cordillera Mountains. By the time the enemies reach North, our defenses would have been fortified. If we can't surpass them in numbers and technology, we will beat them with tactics. We need to dig trenches from Caloocan to Novaliches. From Arayat, sir. I am just waiting for the President's approval. What a mess. - I hope he approves it. - He must. General. Kindly ask Mascardo if he understands Tagalog. Or do you understand Spanish more? - It was clear... - I understand Tagalog. I will return when I'm done here. He doesn't have authority over me. I'm the commander of Pampanga. The President gave him authority over the troops... but not over generals like him. Is that so? Rusca! Ride to Arayat. Tell to that Mascardo's face that I will... have you arrested for stubbornness. Is that a threat? General, what's important is you return to Bagbag and send reinforcements before the Americans attack. I was about to leave if not for that Luna's arrogance. Who is he to give me orders? If he wants a fight I'm not backing down! Román! Send a telegram to every official under Mascardo and tell them they are to report to the main headquarters in Pampanga tonight. They are all under my command so they cannot disobey. Rusca, inform President Aguinaldo that... General Luna plans to have Mascardo arrested if this continues. This is bad. The Americans will think there's confusion amongst our ranks. It's true, isn't it? Damn it! If that bastard is looking for a fight, I will give it to him. Move away! Stop the music! Soldiers! Do not follow Luna's orders. Arm yourselves! What are you waiting for? Get Captain Janolino. Tell him to gather the soldiers headed for Bagbag and have them report to me. Tell Luna that... He'd rather lie in a coffin, because he will only take orders from the President or fellow Caviteños. Idiot! Does he think Cavite is a different country? He has gathered his troops and officers. They're heading to Guagua. - What's he gonna do there? - If you want to face him, he'll be there. - How many men do we have now? - The Bernal brothers are here. - Captain. Major. - General. Do not worry, General. We are behind you. There are some men stationed at the bridge. Rusca hasn't returned yet. - Jose? - General. Stay here with a few lieutenants to oversee the bridge defenses. Everyone else come with me to Guagua. Send a telegram to Alejandrino. - I need the sharpshooters in Guagua. - Yes, sir. And let's bring a coffin. There's trouble brewing in Guagua. General Mascardo has armed his troops and is waiting for General Luna. You have to decide. General Luna. We apologize on behalf of General Mascardo. - Women of the Red Cross. - I know. General, we do not want fighting amongst fellow Filipinos. - She has a point, General. - I didn't ask for this, Major. Isa... Miss. General. Tell Mascardo I'm giving him one more chance to surrender peacefully. It's all in his hands. I understand, ladies. But it's too late. I'll only take orders from the President, not to someone like Luna. What are you really fighting about? Isabel... To hell with you two, Tomas. You're acting like children. General. - Paco. - What is it, sir? Send a telegram to Bagbag. - Find out their situation. - Do you have orders? Just find out how they are. The Americans are here! Americans. The Americans are here! The Americans! Go ahead, shoot me. I'm here. Shoot me. Now! General Tomas Mascardo. I'm here to arrest you in the name of the Philippine Republic Army. Show yourself. - Good evening, General Luna. - Good evening too. I trust that you will surrender peacefully. I told you if you want to arrest me, bring a coffin. You really are insane. That's your request. You're surrounded by my troops. How many men do you have? Fifteen? Twenty? Tomas. We only need to shoot you, and you're standing right in front of me. Easy. Think carefully. You know what to do. We can easily... First Battalion Sharpshooters, sir. What now? - You son of a bitch. - Wait! Wait. General. General Tomas Mascardo, under orders from President Aguinaldo... Thank you, Tomas. Just in time, Rusca. General, I ran into Paco. There's terrible news. The Americans have attacked Bagbag and Quinga. Both camps are in grave danger. Joven! Over here! Damn it, where are the reinforcements? Don't! Joven! Joven, where are you going? Stay here! Stay here. Forward! Guard the entrance! Where are the rest? They went to Quinga to help Goyong. - Joven. - General. Can you move? Medic! Over here! General! General, we're ready. General, the Americans have taken Quinga. General del Pilar and his men has retreated to San Fernando. Is this our fate, Paco? We fight with our enemies. We fight with our allies. It's exhausting. Luna has not been able to stop the enemy's advance. We should ask for a cease fire so we can talk with the Americans. Granted we are at a disadvantage, but how much is America willing to sacrifice? Do you know how much it cost them to wage this war? General Luna is here. A minute. Gentlemen. Bring your glasses. Twenty-four hours jail time is too short, I see. That's why I surrendered peacefully. Brandy? Mr. President. I would like to resign as head of the Army. Why? It's impossible for me to do my job under these circumstances. Especially when I just heard that the traitors Paterno and Buencamino have been set free. They are respectable citizens. They have contributed resources to our cause. They promoted annexation under the American flag, while our soldiers and I are out there fighting the very same enemy. I will not accept such treason while I'm alive. General Luna. You are a military genius, but you don't understand politics. If setting traitors free is how you define politics, then I want no part of it. I'm sorry, General Luna, but I can't accept your resignation. - But I cannot... - You are the only one who can lead our Army. Our country needs you. Then allow me to lead. Allow me to instill discipline! And please approve my plan to erect a fortress up North. That is the only way of defeating the Americans. What can you tell me about General Luna, aside from what we've already seen? We have something to confess. We believe he has a hidden agenda. This happened recently. General Luna lost his temper in front of everyone at the plaza. What else is new? He said he would not hesitate to shoot all traitors, even if it was you, Mr. President. And there are rumors that... he's thinking of proclaiming himself as a dictator to replace you. Where did you hear this? I myself witnessed his outburst at the plaza. We heard from other officers about his plans of becoming a dictator. That's not true. You know Luna. He can't control his outbursts, but his words are just air. It may just be air to us, but Luna means what he says. And we all know he can be blinded by anger, like a raging bull. Luna is my most capable general. There's Goyong. - And Ricarte. - I'm here too. Let's not forget that he abandoned his post in Bagbag, resulting in great losses. Our country would be in a sad state if only one man is capable of leading the military. Luna does more harm than good. He must be replaced for the benefit of everyone. If only we could... Thank you, gentlemen. I need time to think. Damn it! Who the hell is knocking? I've been knocking forever. Mother. What brings you here? My little Antonio. Let me see. You'll live. - I heard you had him arrested... - Mascardo? - Yes, after... - No. Quinito, your brother. Was it over a woman? Yes. Was he drunk? He's out? He was there for two nights. Good. No one is above the law. Yes. You look haggard. And you lost weight. Do you still get to sleep? - We're in the middle of a war. - I know that. You father and I gave you a good education. And yet, you still chose to be in the middle of this mess. It's my destiny, Mother. Is it? Sit down. Close your eyes. Close them. Do you remember our Christmases in Binondo? Your sister. Numeriana. The gifts by the Nativity. The music. Manuel's violin. All the delicious food. Jose and Joaquin. Who could never wait to touch the food. My beloved father, always smiling, holding his cigar. And Juan. If only I could be with them again. Our Christmas Eve was always filled with happiness back then. Do you remember those times? Yes, Mother. And we allowed you and Juan to study in Europe. Where our minds were awakened about the state of the country. It all began with a dream to win our rights under the rule of Spain. Until we woke up to the truth, due to the ceaseless oppression of the Spaniards. That we are no different from them. But those dreams were shattered when they assassinated Dr. Jose Rizal. I feel sad whenever I think of him, and his sacrifice. My idolized country, sorrow of my sorrows, beloved Filipinas, hear my last goodbye. There l leave you all. Goodbye, dear parents, brother and sisters, fragments of my soul. Childhood friends in the home now lost. Give thanks that I rest from this wearisome day. Goodbye, sweet foreigner, my friend, my joy. Farewell, loved ones, to die is to rest. This is the biggest sacrifice of all. But that is not the only way of showing your love for the country. Your brother Juan knows that. But Juan also knows the Filipino mind. We're all divided and blind to the concept of nationhood. He knows we will not wake up until someone sacrifices himself for the country. In our travels in Europe, it became clear how big our failure was. I know what you're saying, son. These are the fruits of your love for us, Mother. Juan and I. Our convictions. You and Juan we're always the closest. In some ways, we share the same destiny. Destiny, Antoñito? Is this destiny or is it your choice? You're a skilled doctor. There's a peaceful life waiting for you, but you choose to wage war. Some politicians and businessmen don't like the way you run things. They say you are too arrogant and strict. They say you are mad with power. Those are just rumors. Sometimes I have to step on some toes to get my job done. I heard from Quinito that the President himself is plotting against you. Aguinaldo is not stupid. We respect each other. We are both Masons. Like Andres Bonifacio? Here. Wear this. Your father is gone. And your brother Manuel too. I don't want anything to happen to my children because of this war. You and Juan. A person who has feelings is not a slave. The beautiful days of roses have come to an end. The nights of our thorny coexistence has begun. Our native land, the blue skies, green fields, a land of art and feelings. - Has everyone left? - Yes, sir. Only the Kawit Brigade will remain. Soon, for love of our motherland. Dismissed! As if by some hidden message, we are snatched by a hidden hand, and tossed about like leaves in a stormy wind. I am asking for an assurance of your loyalty. Can l rely on you? Yes, Mr. President! Soon... Dismissed! We will all just be whirlwinds of dust. I can't remember when I wrote that poem. General, I have a question. Do you often think that your life is in danger? Because of the war? Because of principles. Every day. Bring your troops here, on the other side of the river. Bring your army here. Yes, General. Come in. From President Aguinaldo. Gentlemen, I have great news. The President is establishing a new cabinet and has asked me to go to Cabanatuan to lead. Things are moving forward. - Finally! - Congratulations! Congratulations! Lieutenant Manuel Quezon. It's been a while. Mr. President. - You received my orders? - Yes, sir. My men and I are on our way to San Isidro. Your guards are staying behind? My dearest Mother With love, Antonio General. We're ready. Sir. Colonel. Don't you get tired of fighting? All that spilled blood? A true patriot is ready to shed blood. To endure hardship is not suffering. It's like receiving a blessing, like love. Do you think we will succeed? I can't assure that. If that happens, it would be a baptism of fire, like a violent tornado. You are also poetic, like the General. He's contagious. General. General, they cannot cross. Looks like fate is trying to stop us. Or maybe those wagons are from Kawit. Román, Rusca, let us go ahead. - Manuel, catch up with us in Cabanatuan. - Yes, General. Take care of the young man. Why, brother? They should've waited for us. - Where's everybody? - They're probably having lunch. It doesn't matter, we're here. Take a rest. - Wait for me here. - Good luck, General. You, soldier. Why is your uniform so dirty? You don't know how to salute? What are your names? Are you deaf? What kind of soldiers are you? The General is on it again. When I come down, you better have your hair cut. Or else, I will shoot you! Mr. President, I've... Shit. What are you doing here? I should ask you that. The President sent me a telegram. Where is he? - He left this morning. - He left? Why did he ask for me? What kind of government is this? - Maybe he just forgot. - Impossible! Why are you sitting at the President's desk? Shouldn't you be shining the Americans' boots? What arrogance! You think you're the only patriot? In this room, yes. I love the Philippines. But not enough to fight for her or die for her! If only you have honor, - I would challenge you to a duel. - Just try me! I've had enough of those sissies. I'll shit on all of them. We're not finished. Who fired that shot? Damn it! Who? I sent you to jail. Why did they free you? Wait! Don't form a circle! What's going on? Cowards! Traitors! Murderers! Traitors! Wait! I surrender! Use your machetes. He's done. Cowards. Murderers. He faced them alone. I couldn't do anything to help. I will never understand why Filipinos would kill Filipinos. They killed all hope for freedom. Well? Is he still moving? The General was right. The Filipino's worst enemy is himself. It is us who killed him. I swear before God and in the names of my father and sons, that I had nothing to do with this incident. I had nothing to do with Antonio Luna's death. It was all Luna's fault. He assaulted the Kawit Brigade. He abused his power. He became over ambitious. He plotted to take over the highest position in the land. - I found it first! - That's mine! Luna's accusations against me were all lies. I love the Philippines. Look at my public service record. I made great sacrifices for this country! My dearest Mother Yes, we disagreed, but I did not kill him. - I said that's mine! - But I found it. - It's mine! - I found it first! Give that to me. Antonio Luna's death is a form of historical cleansing. Wait. We're not done with him. Antonio Luna was cruel, abusive, and arrogant! I didn't want him to die, but I admit, I believe that he deserved his fate. Wait. Not there. Move them over here. I never sent him a telegram. It was Luna who sent me a telegram saying that he was coming to see me in Cabanatuan. But I was not there at that time. Forward march! When the crime happened, we were in Bulacan and Pampanga, inspecting General del Pilar's troops, checking ammunition. General Luna's death was a heavy blow. He was the only one capable of leading us to independence. He was my most brilliant general. Why would I want him killed? No. There was no conspiracy. No threats. Luna was my best general. I lost the war. We all lost. The Filipino nation seeks its independence, and I will strive to attain my country's cause until the very end. It's better to die in battle... Than to accept any foreign rule. If progress is just a dream... Then let us dream on until death. Soon, for love of our motherland... As if by some hidden message, we are snatched by a hidden hand, and tossed about like leaves in a stormy wind. Soon, we will all just be whirlwinds of dust. General. These are what's left of Luna's men. What do you want to do with them? Get 60. Ripped by iDelete
