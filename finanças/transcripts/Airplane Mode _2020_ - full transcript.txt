Good morning, sweetie. Urgh, Dad, come on! Every... That's so gross. You need to get this door fixed, for the love of God. I'm sorry. I'll fix it today, okay? You've been saying that for the last three months. Good morning, my lovely followers! How are you? I'm doing just great. And do you know why? Today I'll be posting a special TBT. A fashion retrospective. Check out my first post. It was about how to wear boyfriend jeans, and I didn't even have a boyfriend. From then on, it was one tip after another... Time went by... So many people started following me. And thanks to all of you, I managed to sign a contract with True Fashion. It feels like ages ago! Actually, it's only been three months, but that's okay. Then, my life changed even more. Remember when I first met Gil? He started working at True Fashion too. Three months of True Fashion and one month of dating Gil. Now, we're exclusive. That's right! Exclusive to each other. Good morning, folks! I've just woken up, but I'm here with you already. Sweetie, let's... Join me and I'll show you everything. I'm sure you'll love it. Kisses! Dating for a month? -I didn't know. -I did. -Look, Laura, it'll be delivered today. -I'm glad, dear. Yes, my retrospective is doing great. Ah, the pancakes... So tell me, are you and Gil going to celebrate? Of course. We have a meeting now. How romantic. Will there be a spreadsheet and a slideshow too? Mom, I really like him, okay? -What's his favorite movie? -He prefers TV. TV shows, huh? Which ones? -Something on Netflix. -I see. Star sign? He's probably a Leo. Or a Gemini, whatever. The main thing is that we have a deep connection -and that's amazing. -I see. And you'll both change the world, making everyone dress like you? Exactly, that's our job. That's why we're called influencers. I thought it was more interesting and original -when you wanted to be a designer. -Do you think it's easy, Dad? It's impossible if you don't try. You really don't get me. I have to go. It's time. No, sweetie, come on. Don't go without breakfast. You're right. Sweetheart! Sweetie. Drive safely, okay? No worries, Dad, it's all under control. And no checking your cell phone! Ana! -Hi! -Ten minutes ago, you were 20 minutes late. Sorry, Carola. I'll be there in five minutes, I promise. Five to thirty... Or forty. Are you crazy, girl? She's here. Don't forget to sort the boards. -Hey! -Hi, how are you? Gil, come with me. She's here. Have you seen Ana? She posted a picture of a car accident. 1,000 likes in one minute. -I hate that girl. -What do you mean, hate? Hate means love. -She's awful. -Awful means amazing. Millennials understand sarcasm, and I speak fluent millennial. With no accent. It's so great that Ana is late, huh? It sucks, right? She's always late. Ana is always ahead. Darling, can you believe that with just one post, she managed to bring back fanny packs? Fanny packs! How awful! Get with it, okay? True Fashion Night is coming up. True Fashion's new collection needs a fierce couple. And we have a fierce girl, and her somewhat tame boyfriend... Hi guys. What's up? How are you? I just got to work. Hey, what's up? Where do I come into all this? Of course we can! Just do as I say. I'm coming. Follow the script. Hi, guys. -She can't find out about anything. -But I don't know anything yet... Here I am! Sorry I'm late. Wow, looking beautiful, beautiful. -Hey. You're not mad at me, are you? -Mad?! Me, mad? Of course not! How could I be mad at you, my lovely? I love you. Thank you. Thank you?! Whatever, Fausto. Just take a picture. Guys, can I take a picture? Kiss, give her a kiss. Okay. Okay, what a lovely kiss, guys. Shall we check out the new collection? This looks like it's from the previous collection... Inspiration, inspiration. But this one is just like that designer's-- References, references. Where do you find inspiration? -It's here, in the air. -It's all very cool, pretty and vibrant. But not original at all. -And are you a designer? -Fausto, I studied fashion. Ana, my pretty little flower. Originality is a myth. It doesn't exist. Who was original? Adam and Eve, and nobody since. They invented nudes, clothes, beachwear... -They even invented love. -I've got goose bumps. Fashion comes and goes, collections come and go. But love remains! And your love is going to make our winter collection the most beautiful and original collection in the world. Ask us how! -How? -How? You're going to move in together. But don't you think we're a bit young to be getting married? It's not marriage, it's co-living. That's right. And True Fashion Night will be your wedding celebration. Co-living. And you'll announce it today, during your one-month anniversary dinner. Any questions? No. That sounds interesting. Really great. So, I'll give it some thought, okay? And we'll meet up later? Kisses. Kisses. I'll give it some thought too, and then we'll... Stay, don't think. I've arranged everything. I need to talk to you. I'll be there in five. Sure, I'll wait for you here. Are you blind, girl? Make that five to forty. Were you on your phone? It tastes like love, a love you'll never forget. Damn it! Was it no good? Would you like me to do it again? No, it's not you. That was great. -We'll be in touch. -Okay, thank you. That guy is in every commercial. The next one is good, he's only worked in the countryside. Ads for cow medicine, fertilizer, tractors... -Nobody knows him here. -Call him in. Next, please. Luis Albuquerque. Quickly, please. -Sorry, I have to get this. -Sure. -Hello? Germano? -Let's go. What a surprise! How are you? -You're moving in together?! -It's not official yet. We've been together a month. Wow. That's an eternity, it's already a bit worn out. -But weddings always go viral. -Mara, we're not getting married. No. What if it doesn't work out? Then this season will end and another will begin. Are you mad? Life's not a TV show. Of course it is! Mine is always on the verge of being cancelled. Don't exaggerate. This amazing gym hired you as an influencer. Only because I brought you here. But Gil is amazing. -You don't even follow him. -But I will, of course. You see, Carola's plan is already working. Mara, I like him. It's not just marketing. I know you do! Do you think that I, your best friend, would tell you to do something just for marketing? I do. Yeah, I would, actually. But you like him, and you're tired of living with your parents. So what's the problem? Anyway, moving on. Come here. -Hi, Inácio. -Hi. Have you seen what Ana got up to today? I can imagine. We got a letter from the DMV. -Another one... -Don't worry. I'll speak to her today. Do you think she'll listen? Of course she will. -I'm her father. -By the way, your dad called. Inácio, I think you should speak to him. No. No way. He wanted to tell us about that fair, -with the classic car race, you know? -Yeah. -The Old-Timer Festival. -That's it. A bunch of wackos obsessed with old junk, Laura. I know. He wants you to go. So why didn't he call me? Because he's stubborn, like you. Ana. -Sweetie, we need to talk. -Not now, I'm late. Ana! Poll time: which incredible True Fashion outfit should I wear tonight? A dress or a blazer? Pumps or boots? It could be a skirt... A skirt or a dress? How about a skirt and heels? -Kiddo. -Hey, I'm getting ready in here! Do you know what this is? What is it? Papyrus? The Treaty of Tordesillas? Oh no, hang on. It must be a letter from my grandpa. You crashed your car eight times this month. That's right, and twice today. What matters is my posts did really well, everything is fine. There's much more to life than your posts doing well. Life doesn't pay my bills. I'm independent, guys, come on. I don't have to answer to anyone, okay? -Anything to say, Inácio? -Yes. -Because she's independent. -The skirt won. Why did I give the option of high heels? -I need to get ready! -I know. -Sit here, Daddy wants to talk to you. -Okay, spit it out. Listen. -I am really worried about you-- -Okay, you're worried. I hear you. I won't use my phone while driving again. Is that what you want? Ana, you're banned from driving. You have no right to control my life anymore. Hey, what is all this? You still live here. And show some respect, I'm still your mother! Follow her out. Excuse me. Okay. Look at this. -I can't believe she drove. -I know. Hey, gorgeous. How are you? Have you eaten? Well, you're really late. I'm sorry. I wasn't using my phone while I was driving, and you know the rest, I got lost! -Well, it happens. -Yeah, it happens. So, let's do the livestream. Whoa, what's the rush? I'm excited to tell everyone the news. Shall we? Let's set up. -Okay then. -Let's do this. -Hang on. -Turn yours on. I'm doing mine. Mine's in place. Let's go. 3, 2, 1... We're live. Hey guys! What's up? Welcome to our dinner date... Our one-month anniversary, right? Here we are talking to hundreds of people... Now thousands, that's a lot of people. Do I tell them or do you? -Let me tell them. -Okay. Guys... Here it comes. -I think we should-- -We're going to move in together! -Isn't that awesome? Really great. -I think we should break up. What? Gil, have you gone crazy? The truth is, Ana, you don't really love me. Gil, that is not true! Ana, I'm a business deal to you. It's as if I was - I don't know - a signed document, a contract. I'm just a supporting actor in your life's script, amid all the glamour, fame and bright lights. Okay, so you decided to start drinking today. -Stop streaming! Give me that! -Wait. I love you, I really love you. I love you. But... Our paths are going to have to split, you know? And our destinies will... They'll di... Div... -Diverge. -Gil, are you reading this?! Farewell. I wish you the best as we part. I wouldn't wish on anybody, this broken heart. Bye bye. "Bye bye", Gil? What do you mean? And that rhyme... What was that rhyme? And I'm stuck with the bill?! -Hey Ana, I wanted to talk-- -Carola, Gil had no right to do that! The world disagrees with you, darling. Have you checked his profile? So he's gotten more popular, is that it? Who doesn't enjoy a bit of romantic drama? He's a hero. -And I'm the villain? -Calm down. It's all under control. Under control, Carola? What-- Everything is alright. Your daughter will be fine, okay? Thank goodness. Thank you, doctor. Okay. See? I said I didn't need to stay the night in hospital. A tiny little crash, all the tests are fine... I'm fine. Where's my phone? You can't have it. But the doctor said I'm fine. That's far from the truth, my girl. -What do you mean? -It's... Baby... You have to be strong. What's going on? You're scaring me. Who is this man? He's a prosecutor. -A promoter? -A prosecutor. Please, sign here. -What is this? -A receipt for your phone. You'll get it back when your sentence is over. -My sentence? -Yes. Cell phones are forbidden. Your addiction is a danger to yourself and others. I'm not addicted to my phone! Give me that. Calm down, sweetie. -This is a court order. -But it's so unfair. It will be good to take a break from it. -How long for? -Until the end of your detention. Detention? What detention? Am I being arrested? Nobody is going to arrest my daughter. -You didn't mention that. -It's part of the treatment. -Do something, Dad! -Look at the state she's in! Actions have consequences. Let's see. Where will the treatment take place? Where will it take place? The... The treatment, uh... It will... -I have to check-- -Listen. Would you mind stepping outside with me for a minute? I'll be back in a minute. Keep calm, okay? -Mom... -Calm down, calm down. Calm down, sweetheart. It's going to be fine. -Do you think she's okay? -I don't know and I don't care. -It's been 12 hours since her last post. -She could have died. I would have let her off. We'd have got a week's media coverage. We've got trouble. That's her mom. Don't be silly, boy. I'm practically family. -What's her name again? -Laura. -Laura, darling. -Carola? -What are you doing here? -I was so worried about our little girl. She can't see anybody. Doctors' orders. She needs to rest. Of course. Fausto, don't let anybody in. Nobody at all. Honey, if there's one thing I'm not, it's nobody. I'm somebody with whom Ana works, -we have contracts, obligations... -Just go away, Carola. But she's like a daughter to me. Say that again. -Say that again! -She didn't mean it, sorry. Sorry. Send her our love, okay? Bye. Ana, leave it alone. -It's not a phone. -Really? Are you sure about that? You think I'm going crazy. -You must do. You even want me put away. -No. -Nobody wants anything like that. -Hey. I think I have good news. We've made a deal. -Will they give me my phone back? -No. So, can I go home? No. You're going to a place with no cell phone coverage. Where, Jupiter? Your grandpa's. -I'd prefer Jupiter. -So would I. -But it's better than getting arrested. -Much better. If your mom's mind is made up... -My life is ruined. -Oh, come on. It's only some time away from social media. Exactly. When I come back, nobody's going to remember me. I'm going to lose my job, my friends, my boyfriend... You've already lost your boyfriend. Sorry. Those who care about you will never forget you. That's right. Gil, have you understood? Shall I explain it again? So we're going to wait for her to get back, right? -Of course. For as long as it takes. -Right. That's okay then. Wrong. We're not waiting a second longer. Time and timelines wait for no man. But, guys... In that case I won't be able to follow the script. I need to make amends, I need to touch people's hearts, and I need to get more followers. -So there's a lot to do. -Yes. -That's why you'll-- -Suffer. Suffer? Me? Why? It's her fault, she ruined everything. You're not really going to suffer, you idiot. -It's a script I wrote. -Worthy of an Oscar! Here's what you're going to do. You're devastated, you're lonely. Why? Because she disappeared. You want her back. Amid the devastation, you will find comfort in the arms -of someone most-- -Fascinating. Do you want to tell it? The story? -Go ahead. I'll let you. -Sorry, my queen. Go on. A new love. -Full of conflict. -Young people love conflict. The audience will love, the audience will hate, the audience will love to hate and the audience will hate to love... the best friend. Hey. Am I too early? You're right on time. This sucks! Sorry. Are you okay? Your phone fell. I picked it up for you. Thank you. Hey pretty girl, how are you doing? What's your name? Can I use your phone real quick? Being selfish is rude. Who's that talking to our sister? I can't talk to strangers. And you're really strange. I just need to use your phone real quick. -Can I borrow it? Just for one thing. -No. What if I just take it, huh? -I'll scream. -You wouldn't dare. Give that to me! Help! -It's real fast. -No. -Just quickly. -What is going on? -Let me go! Help! -What is going on? What is going on? She's trying to steal my phone, João. I don't want to steal it, I just want to borrow it. I need to find this address. -That's the house of-- -My grandpa. You're Germano's granddaughter. Everyone knows him round here. I see... I don't know him. What's he like? Weird? Of course not. I knew it. A real weirdo. A weirdo... You're the weird one. Just a minute. Germano's granddaughter has arrived. That crazy city girl? Becky, not so loud! Hey! Do you want a lift? And the last one. Thanks. I'd have been lost without you. That much is obvious. Stay away from my phone, you hear? See you. Hello! Hello! Is anyone there? ...today's show, we're going to be talking to you, country women and country men, who wake up-- Hey! Who are you? -Who are you? -I asked first. If you're Germano, I'm your granddaughter. I was expecting a child. You've been waiting a while, then, huh? Crashing a car because of a cell phone. How childish. That's probably why I was expecting a child. Or maybe you're going cuckoo. This is when the grandpa remembers he hasn't seen his grandchild for ages, then some cheesy cutesy music plays and they hug. I'll show you around. -Dear farmers... -And don't touch anything! ...have callous hands, hands that know how to work the land... Let's go! ...blessed hands... I don't have my phone. Can you lend me yours? You don't have one, do you? There's no coverage here. So why have one? -Is there coverage in town? -The town is far away. Come on. Here's my bedroom, your bathroom and your bedroom. And that's the lot. -What about this door here? -No! Nobody touches that door. Why not? Because I said so. "Because I said so" doesn't seem like a good answer to me. Well it does to me. Isn't there any toilet paper in this house? There's a bidet. -I've never used one. -It's not difficult. Do you have paper in your bathroom? Not here, but there's loads at the store. Is it far? Fairly. Can I take your pick-up? Oh, God. That's it. I don't believe it! I forgot the money. How did I do that? Stop right there! You? -Me? -What are you doing here? -I... -This is Ana. -Germano's granddaughter? -That's right. Yes, I'm Ana. Pleased to meet you. You see, there wasn't any toilet paper at my grandpa's and I needed some. In fact, I still do. Anyway, I got lost, then I found my way again. Then I saw that your store was closed. The door was unlocked, by the way. Very dangerous. A thief could get in. There aren't any here. Not until now, anyway. Son, take her home. Girls, help me with this mess. -Do you need any more? -No, this one is fine. -How much is it? -It's a gift. A gift to you. Thank you. -Well, I'd better get going... -Let's go. I'll take you. Of course. Thanks, Mom. Thank you. And sorry. -Good night, Ana. -Bye, João. -Thanks again for the ride. -No problem. Grandpa! At last! Where are you going? Back to bed. I'm on vacation. That's where you're wrong. Sit down. Have some. I made it myself. I can tell - it's as rough around the edges as you are. It's all natural, no additives. Does it taste of anything? The store is full of tasty things, I know that now. Can I go and buy some? You have to help me in the workshop. And what if I don't want to help you? Then you'll go back to the city and deal with the courts. Do you know what I don't understand? With all this positive energy and good vibes, why on Earth did my dad distance himself from you? Don't be long. And wash the dishes before you leave the house. Right. Where do I start? By changing your clothes. Those are no good for working in. Your mistake, Germano. Look... Style. Style is important for every occasion. Okay, then. What do you know about mechanics? Tow trucks. I'm very familiar with tow trucks. You should wear this instead. Over my dead body. But your clothes are too tight. These clothes? These clothes are in, okay? They're horrible. Horrible? Horrible? Ana! Bring me a tire iron, please. Is this it? No. It's shaped like a cross, on the counter. Oh, okay. Is it this one? -Yes. -So this is a tire iron. And you can spin it just like a tire. I'm tired of carrying junk around. -You're learning, aren't you? -To carry junk around? To be responsible. For carrying junk? Hand me the wrench. Thanks. This screw is rusty. I have to get it out to drain the old oil. Calm down, Grandpa. Let me try it. Pass me the wrench. It's a bit crooked. I see. Hang on. I did it! I did it. I managed, did you see? I did it. -High five. -Congratulations, you did it. -I did it, but now I'm filthy. -Like a true mechanic. -I need to go to the store. -Can I come too? Thanks. Spit it out, João. It's nothing. It's just... It must be strange, moving to a new place like this, where everything is different. Do you want to leave? No. No, of course not. Pass me that screwdriver, please. Thanks. Can I have the smaller one? João? Julia. Julia, come help me. I'm busy. Does Mom know much time you spend on that phone? Oh, man, you're so annoying! That one there. The yellow one. Thanks. Crazy city girl. Work, don't talk, Julia. Hi, Germano. Excuse me, Mom. Today is brownie day. I can smell it. Ana has told me a lot about João. About his talent, his promising future. You've raised a lovely family. Even when you were on your own. I've got three kids, Germano. I can't even get a minute on my own. And your granddaughter? Has she settled in? She's getting there. Go on, give it to me, just for a minute. -I said no! -Guys, I need to focus here. Oh, Julia, you're not even using your phone. You're not allowed to use it. -Right? -Excuse me? -You're addicted to cell phones. -That's not true. You're here so you don't kill anyone with your car, crazy city girl. -Stop it, Julia. -Wake up! -You hillbilly. -You can't speak to her like that. Then I'll speak to you like that. You're both hillbillies who don't know anything. You have no idea who I am. Aren't you incredibly famous on the internet? Now another crazy city girl has taken her place. -Give me that. -Take it. Julia, give me that phone right now. -Give it to me. Give it here! -No. -Give it here. -No! Julia, enough. Look at this brownie, straight from the oven. -No! Stop it! -What is going on here? -Give it to me. -No. Ana! You were spying on me. You tried to steal a phone from a child, Ana. You broke into a store. You told the whole town about me. Got everyone to watch me. How could I know if you would play by the rules? -By trusting me, perhaps? -Trust is earned, Ana. Were you ever going to let me earn yours? I wasn't going to steal Julia's phone, I wanted to borrow it. To find your house. I'd never steal from the store. I don't do that. I even left a note. You judged me without listening to me. Why are we here? To see the most beautiful view in the world. You haven't seen the world. And to tell you that you're right. Am I indeed? About what? I judged you without listening to you. That's okay. You weren't the first. Do you have any idea what my life is like? It's madness. Thousands of people follow me every day, see everything I do. But they have no idea who I am. Living is about searching, not finding. Says who? Says the person who thought this was the most beautiful view in the world. Granny? Yes. Mérida was an intelligent woman, determined, feisty... Sometimes a bit contradictory. Just like you. Tell me more about her. I should have opened this door sooner. As soon as you got here. It wouldn't have been the right time. My mind was far from here. I wouldn't have been able to look at anything properly. I like this one. Did you like taking pictures? I did, with Mérida. -Our trips, our adventures... -You basically invented the selfie. -I like it. -You look just like her. May I? Apart from your clothes, which I think are awful. Hers are lovely. She used to sew. She was a woman of many talents. Can I use it? Would it matter if I said no? No. -Good morning. -Good morning. Good morning. Grandpa. You could have warned me. Sorry, Ana. I didn't mean to startle you. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be startled. I'm sorry about my sisters. Are you two going to apologize to each other all day? Sorry about my grandpa. João. If you're not busy today, give me a hand with the car. It would be a big help. Of course, Germano. You can count on me. It's my pleasure. Ana... I brought you these, since you didn't try them yesterday. -Brownies. -For me? Yes. What do you think? You're full of surprises. I bet you are full of surprises, too. Hardly. The whole world knows I'm an irresponsible city girl. I disagree. I don't think you are. That's because you don't know me properly yet. Delicious! -Fire her up! -Okay, here goes. There she goes! Yeah! And this is for you. Aren't you going to say thank you? Well... Let's see if it fits me first. She was raised by wolves. I'm really sorry for calling you both hillbillies. Sorry for calling you a city girl. -A crazy city girl. -Julia. That's okay. You were just telling the truth. Thanks a lot. Come on, Julia. Ana. Thank you. I made this for you, too. Thank you. What is it? Can I borrow your phone, João? I've never had one, Ana. I haven't got one. -What?! What do you mean? -I'm serious. You've never had one - that's crazy! Do you think Julia will lend me hers? What for? Mara took my place as an influencer. I just want to see how she's getting on. I see. Lie down here. Lie down. That's it. Now close your eyes... If I close my eyes I can't see, João. Close your eyes, Ana! Okay. You peeked! You can't peek! I only peeked because you were peeking at me. Okay, so... Let's focus. Close your eyes. I'm bored to death! Aren't we going fishing? Gramps! There you are. I was looking for you. You've never called me Gramps before. Of course I have. You look so much like your grandma. Grandpa... What happened? Between you and my dad. When your grandmother got sick, your dad thought she should be treated in the city, and she preferred to stay here. So, didn't she decide? Well... I don't know if I let her choose, or if I made her choose what I wanted. Gramps. Can I show you something? Hang on. Grandpa. Shut your eyes, okay? Okay, now you can open them. -So, do you like it? -It's lovely, Ana! It's from my collection. Your collection? Yep. I always wanted to be a designer, and now I'm giving it a go. What do you think? I don't know about fashion. But you're so elegant and charming. You actually look like an Italian designer. I see. You're making fun of me. Me? Far from it, Grandpa! I just think you're more of a fashion editor. Super stylish, setting trends all over the world, and know all about fashion. Okay, I'll present the concept and then you tell me what you think. -Ready? -Of course, ragazza! The inspiration came from the love story between my grandmother and my grandfather. My grandmother was an audacious woman. She liked to travel to far-flung exotic places, always with my grandfather by her side. Taking turns to drive, sleeping out in the forest, facing any obstacle in their path. And that's what makes this collection what it is. It's for those that like to travel, at any time. The name is a mix of my own and my grandma's, Mérida. That's how the collection came to be called... Meridiana. A troppo bello name. Grazie very much, my dear. Grazie very much. Surprise! Your car part, Germano. Ana! -Can you bring me the other wrench? -Sure. Hold it there, please. -Is this the wrench you want? -Thanks. Ready! Great job, Grandpa! High five! So! Who's hungry? And the grand finale... So good. Have some rice. Ana? Yes, please. Aren't you eating? Your mouth is full. Sorry. I just can't stop eating this amazing meal you made. Yes, I will. So... Are you going to the fair? -Fair? What fair? -The opening night of the Winter Festival. It's next Saturday, a week before the car race. Right. There'll be forró, an auction... As well as the best cakes in the world. I'm joking. There'll be a stand selling my cakes, no big deal. That is a big deal! But I don't think I can go, can I? Good evening, folks. This beautiful suckling pig is being auctioned tonight. Ready, and we're off. Where's my first bid? 50, I heard 50. 60 here. Who'll give me 70? -80. -80 here at the front... Poor piggy. Come with me. I've got something to show you. Julia! -140. -140. Rebeca, I want to go with them. No, you want a candy apple. Two, I want two! -190. -190, mayor? This evening's suckling pig has been sold to our mayor. You suck! My turn. No! -Good evening! -Hey! How are you? Almost. Almost. Well done! What prize would you like? Piggy, piggy. Thank you. -I rock! -You rock. -Really? -Absolutely. Rebeca, is that true? Why do you care? Are you kidding me? I have to know. Yeah? So come with me. Come on! Julia! Clara! You should be a chef, you know. It's really tough. -It's impossible if you don't try. -I know... I did an exam for a course in São Paulo. -I bet you'll get in. -I did. -I got in and won a full scholarship. -You got in? Ana... Oh Ana, I did, but I'm not going. What do you mean, you're not going?! I can't leave my sisters and my mom here. Okay, João. Let's see. Your mom raised you and has the store, Rebeca will end up doing Formula 1, and Julia will get elected and become mayor of this place. Okay, but what if it makes them sad? Right. They will be sad if you're sad, thinking you're making them happy. Stop being silly. I love my family, Ana, that's all. That's why you shouldn't lie to them, João. Come on, I've got something to cheer you up. One portion of cotton candy for a lovely couple. -It's for her. -Thanks. Thanks. That's the stuff! Something that no chef could ever improve. True. Unless... Unless...? I thought that was delicious. How about you? I think I need another taste. My God. Hey, Julia. Are you paparazzi now? Hi guys. What's up? Hey! How's it going? So... We're just here because... She's a fan. Oh, really? What's your name? Clara. -So you used to follow me? -Of course. -Guys, are you dating? -Julia. What? It's okay, your boyfriend is already with someone else. He has no shame! -Clara! Be quiet! -What's she talking about? Gil is dating Mara. Such a scandal. They're even living together. -You must be mistaken. -Who's Gil? -Give me that phone. -No, no, no. -Give it to me. Let me see it. -Ana! -Do you have a boyfriend? -No. -I just need a phone. -What for? It can't be true. Mara and Gil, I don't believe it! Ana, forget about it. Easy for you to say. It's not your life. It's not yours either anymore. Or is it? You really don't get it, do you? Your call is being sent to voicemail. Please leave a message after the tone. Carola, it's Ana. I'm coming back. -As soon as you get this-- -Ana! Ana! Stop! -Swear I won't be arrested? -I swear. Your grandfather has spoken to the mayor. Your sister must want to kill me. Forget about that, okay? Let's look forwards. Rest now. -We don’t have to talk. -If we don't, we won't work it out. Lie down here, that's it. Lie down, come here. Close your little eyes. If I close my eyes, I can't look forward. And then she calmed down. Yeah. I want to tell her the truth. I know, Laura, I know it's important. I know that it's going well, but we can't keep lying to her. João... We need to talk. RECIPES My darling son, Seeing as we couldn't speak face to face, I'm counting on these written words to save us. It has never been easy to talk to your father, nor to you, so I need you both to understand and respect my decisions. I have had a wonderful life: going on adventures all over Brazil, being fascinated by cultures from all over the world... However, it is in this house that I have experienced my greatest joys. Here, I want to keep them, as I know that the sweetest memories never fade. My grandma wanted to say she'd rather stay, and my dad and my grandpa should work it out. -The letter was never sent. -So they never talked about it. That's right. Men... Hurry up, João. -Is that everything? -Yes, thanks. -Julia! Come and give me a hand! -I'm busy. -Now! -But I'm really busy, Rebeca. Julia! -Where is she? -We're trying to find out. -Don't try, succeed. -Okay, Carola. Come on, Fausto! Ana, I've been wanting to ask you something. -Your grandpa... He... -I don't know how he'll react, you know... Or my dad. Wouldn't it be great if they got closer again? And all because of you! Are you happy you're here? Really, truly happy? What do you think? I don't know. I knew they'd come for the race. -My car looks great! -I've been missing you terribly too. -It's been so long. -Don't say that. There, it's over. You can use your phone, you can drive... Just not at the same time. -What is a phone, again? -Look at you! Wow, Dad. What a beauty! It's just perfect. Look at that. Hey, sweetie. -A gift! Your outfit for the day. -Outfit? -What outfit? -Your codriver outfit! Are you in? -Of course I am! -Then let's go get changed. Let's go. Let's go folks, it's time! You're looking hot in that uniform. Very funny. -Hey beautiful! -Hello! How's it going? -It looks like it all turned out fine. -Sure does. Come on, come this way. Come on. -Hi! -Hello. -How are you doing? -Pleased to meet you. How are you? -Oh my God. -What is it? Who is that? Carola. I'll talk to her. No, Mom. Let me deal with it, don't worry. -Sweetie... -Dad, this is my problem. But she only knows you're convalescing, nothing about your sentence. Leave it with me. Do you think she really doesn't know about the sentence? Did your doctor tell you to rest or to stab me in the back? -What are you talking about? -Show her. You were going to disappear for a bit. -How sweet. But please delete it. -Delete it? We don't have the means to delete you happily wearing another brand. What brand? -Why is she laughing? -No idea. Come on, I'll show you. Meridiana. For those that like to travel, at any time. -I love it. -It's mediocre, don't you think? It's mediocre. It's okay. It's... It's a start, it's on the right track. But as you didn't betray us, you can come back into our arms. I... Thank you, but I don't want to. -You mean "let's go", right? -No. I want to stay here, guys. I want to make the most of my family, -get to know myself better, you know? -Darling. Knowing oneself is the first step to self-loathing. I don't even say hi to myself. Carola, the truth is, I wasn't happy at True Fashion. I want to find my own way, do something a bit more interesting, more real, more original... Anyway, you have Mara and Gil. Girl, you got more likes in a day than those two got in-- Don't go on about it. Let her be, if it's what she wants. It is. -You understand, right? -Absolutely, of course we do, my dear. So, we'll be going then. Could I just ask you to take Fausto to the bathroom? -But I don't need the bathroom. -Yes, you do need the bathroom. He asks to stop to pee at every service station. He's just like a child. So take him, please. No rush. Come on, I'll show you. -But I'd like your opinion. -What is it? Would you prefer racecar driver's overalls or something more sixties, more groovy? I think you don't need to go to all that trouble. -Shall we take a selfie? -Sure. I'm a bit rusty, but I should remember how to do it. Let's see. Come on. -No, hold on. Come over here a bit. -Here? How is it? Do you like it? -There's a guy behind us. -Oh yeah, it's an ad. Shall we take another? Ana! We can take another one, Ana, it's just a photo. What's wrong? What's going on? Who is this man? He's a prosecutor. Please, sign here. Ana! Come over and take a picture with us, sweetie. An actor. He was an actor. This can't be happening. I can't believe it. Sweetheart... You can't have done this to me. Was none of this real? -Ana... -João, they lied to me. All that time they were telling me that I, that I wasn't genuine, wasn't original-- That I was living a fake life, wasn't interested in reality... I knew about it too. But try to understand, Ana. Oh, my baby... -Ana! -Ana! Sweetheart! Hello? Hello Ana, can you hear me? Ana, talk to-- Darling Ana. Did you tell Carola that you'd rather die than carry on being an influencer? It wasn't quite like that. Too bad that True Fashion doesn't want you back. And for at least the next two years, as per your contract, you may not work for any other human fashion brand. I didn't realize there was any other kind. You see? How savvy is your agent? And now, my dear, you're going to have to start thinking... outside the box. Gorgeous! That needs a picture. A thousand likes. Thank you. Hey Ana. I've just finished my course here in São Paulo. I'm working for a catering company too, we go to some awesome events... If you want to talk to me... I think there's so-- -Hey. -Hey. Look, we know what we did to you was bad, okay? We're sorry. But we also know that you're so much smarter, Ana dear. Who knows, you may find it in your heart to forgive us. Forgive us. Fantastic. Very good! If she launches, I'm done for. I won't be able to prove she stole my drawings. This is so typical of Carola. That's why we're here. The truth always wins in the end. -That's what I always say. -It's an excellent philosophy to live by. We've got your back, okay sweetie? I haven't forgiven you yet. -Ana. -Sweetie. What are you waiting for? We have to get ready. Come on. Hi guys. Thank you, darlings. How are you? -Good evening. -Good evening. -Name? -João. Go on through. Look who's here. What a gorgeous model. Shall we take a picture? You'll have to crouch down, you're very tall. Come on, let's go. Come on, Germano. Slowly. That's right. -Everyone knows what to do? -Yes. Then, let's go. Germano, I'm going after her. -Excuse me. Could I take a photo with you? -Of course. Thanks. You're quite a hit, Germano! Laura has just gone up the stairs. I don't know. I was thinking about Jaciara wearing that one, -and a Peruvian one for her. -And the bag? I'm not sure about the bag. I'll decide later. Put that away, please. Did you get my invite? Of course not, I hate you. I hate you more. You stole my collection, Carola. -I'll take you to court. I have proof! -What proof? Give me that! I know that's not the only evidence you have. You have photos of my drawings on your phone. On my phone? Let me check. Whoops! They got deleted! Ah, it's all been deleted... Look, cutey. I think it's best if you don't take me to court. By the time you prove anything, we'll already be on our next collection. You are so average! Stealing drawings for a collection. Seriously, Carola! Oh, darling. I took your amateur drawings and I transformed them into a marvelous collection. If I hadn't, what would you have done with them? What would it be? Nothing. Nothing. -Lovely chatting with you. -I hated chatting with you! You are ridiculous. A fool! -Dónde está la donna of questa craziness? -One moment. -What is she doing here? -Guess, Fausto. Who's this? A very important Italian fashion editor, he wants to talk about the collection. Piacere, signore. Carola. Germano De La Fortuna. -Never heard of him. -Very important. -Voglio parlare about tu collezione. - Sure. -Take care of Ana. -Okay. Per favore. Io solo looking for la sinceritá, laveritá, laoriginalitá. Sì, sì, ma... Anche io. La originalitá è tutto. Tutto, sì. Tutto. Carola, I need to talk to you. Scusa, signore. Per favore. -What is it, Fausto? -It's Ana. She's disappeared, just like a vampire. No problem. The show is about to start, she can't do anything now. Maledetta. Good evening, influencers and True Fashionistas from all over the world! We are very proud to present True Fashion's new and original winter collection! Excuse me. How are you doing? Look at this. And now, the moment we've all been waiting for. Gil and Mara, our True Fashion couple. Today is a celebration, a celebration of love. A celebration of the union of these two beauties, who love to travel, hitting the roads of the world. Our collection is inspired by them. And it's for you, who like to travel at any time: the Meridiano collection. No, it's not. Ana! No. You're both traitors, you know that? You're fake. None of this is inspired by you. Carola, this isn't in the script. -Let's go. -Bye bye. It's all going wrong. I think it's best you get out of here, girl. I think it's best you keep quiet, you crook. This is my collection, and it's called Meridiana. Meridiana! "Ana", because I created it. It was inspired by my grandparents. True Fashion didn't just steal my clothes, they stole my history, my memories. No, guys, this is not true. It's lies, people. All lies. Carola, tell the truth. Did you create this collection? Yes. Yes I did, I created it all. Go! Now! I made it all, people, it's my creation. I took your amateur drawings and I transformed them into a marvelous collection. If I hadn't, what would you have done with them? Nothing. Nothing. People, this isn't true, okay. It's all special effects. Guys, stop! This is fake! I will kill you, girl. I will kill you! You see? The truth won. You faker. I love you. I doubt it. I can prove it. I don't know... I think I need some more proof. Kiss! Not that. -What now? -I think we need to... What we really love is Dog Love dog food. I would never steal anything, this must be a misunderstanding. Turn off that camera! Kisses. Selfie time, guys! Rebeca. A bit closer to Laura! Big smiles!
