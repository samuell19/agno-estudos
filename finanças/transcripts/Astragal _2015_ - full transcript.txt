DOULLENS PRISON APRIL 19, 1957 I think my leg’s broken. What happened? It hurts. Please take me away from here. They’re not looking for me yet. You okay? ASTRAGAL I’d like to help you, but... I have a wife and kids. I can’t. It’s too dangerous. All I can do is stop a car. Won’t anyone stop? I can’t take you. Forget it. A girl’s been hurt. Show me your foot. No! Stop playing the good Samaritan. - Don’t start... - Screw you, Marcel! Come on. I’ll come back for you. Wait for as long as it takes. Don’t breathe a word and don’t move. Here. Do you like rum? I don’t know. I’ve never tried it. What’s your name? Albertine. I’m Julien. Can you go on a motorbike? Take me to Paris... First, we’ll look after that. Come on. What does “arthrodesis” mean? It means “stuck”. You can’t bend your foot now. Did it cost a lot? - What? - The operation. It cost what it cost. So, a lot. Albertine... You don’t owe me anything. Julien... Get up. You went back to sleep. It’s nearly 9. She’ll be here soon. It’s nice of her to leave us her bed. Nini’s nice sometimes. Sometimes! Come on, up you get. I forgot about men. Look how my hand curves as it strokes your chest. I’m getting fake papers made for you. What’ll my name be? Sophie Gambier. Sounds like Gambler! I’ve nothing left to drink. I don’t go out now I’m alone... except to visit Dédé in prison and to deliver my ties. Will you hire me? Yeah, I hire and fire. No problem. I’ll ask Coco to get us a drink. I bet she’s at the neighbor’s again. What did you break? - The astragalus. - The what? It’s a tiny bone in the foot. Oh, that’s alright then. With the size of the plaster, I thought it’d take ages to heal. That dress suits you. It’s not too...? Very pretty. It’s the best I had... Anyway, I can’t get into it anymore. She’s getting on my nerves! I like it here. Well, I gotta go. Not even a kiss? Sure I’ll kiss you. I’ll phone Riton to see how you are. - Who? - He owns the café. Nini knows him. - She’s a kid. - What does that change? It changes the price. I’ll see what I can do next time. Julien! There you are! I’ve been looking for you. - Are you going already? - Here. - For you. - Thanks. - Only for you. - When’ll you be back? Very soon. Albertine Damien, born in Algiers in 1937, adopted at the age of 2 by Colonel Damien and his wife. Brown eyes, Spanish-Moorish features, must have Arabic, Spanish or gypsy blood. Your behavior led your adoptive parents to put you in The Good Shepherd, a reformatory in Marseille, where you met your accomplice, Marie Lefèvre. - Correct? - Yes. - Is this a joke? - The money! - Looks perfect. - Yeah. What? Isn’t the wig good? Yes, it’s good. It cost enough! Go on, you can’t be late for prison. - Need anything? - Some smokes. Oh, yeah, smokes. See you later. Yeah, smokes. How much? I’ll buy a Talbot soon. Yeah, a very discreet car! You don’t get it. The flashier it is, the more discreet. Pandora’s box is open! So... Well, they’re Marks, folks. Count ’em. - Can we eat now? - Yes, it’s ready. There’s a little poem. - Here goes. - Give me a hand. Let’s go. And don’t rip me off. - You know me. - I do know you. Philippe’s always so subtle! Come with me to Paris. I gotta go to Nini’s. We don’t have time. Why do you wanna go to Nini’s? What’s it to you? I don’t wanna go. If you go, count me out. Why not? - ’Cause I’m busy. - What’s she done to you? - Nothing. - Here it comes! Chow time! Oh, shit! - What? - I got it wrong again. - Unbelievable! - He was talking to me. Come on, eat up. Says you! I knew it. “Don’t breathe a word”... Well before those words, I’d recognized Julien. Some scars are imperceptible to those who haven’t been in jail. Speaking without moving your lips while your eyes fake indifference or the opposite of what you feel. I set a stuck foot in a crook’s life. Everything surprises... and intrigues me. - What’re you doing? - Nothing. Don’t worry. What is it? Albertine Damien, in your confiscated notebook, you write: “I came to conclude that events are accidental in life “and you reach reality, when you get under the crust of ideas and feelings.” Well! Instead of committing a holdup, seriously wounding Miss Chausson, and being a streetwalker, you should go for the Femina Prize! Do you have any regrets? Not yet, but if I ever do, I’ll let you know. I think you’ll have many years in prison to think it over, miss. 7 years! - I’m not-- - Don’t worry. There are pardons. - And parole. - Sure! - Your hand. - Got Lefèvre’s file? - Yeah. And the other one? - Come on. Where am I going? - Hello, miss. - Hello. René, your bike is in the way downstairs. - It’s not downstairs. - Sometimes it is. The bill was very steep this morning. Look at my new shoes and coat. Very pretty. Take a red pill now, and another this evening. Thank you, Doctor. I did the week’s shopping, then either I borrow from my grasping neighbor... or my sister-in-law. When you can, why don’t you ask Julien for an advance? Broke already? Oh, shit, I forgot the bread. Coco, go before it closes. Be careful, ’cause that’s the last one. We’ve no news of Julien. You know he’s banned from Paris. He could phone. What if something happened to him? You hid this one! Go to your room! It’s... - for Dédé’s Christmas present. - Don’t cry with your mouth full. Life’s dear. It’s not my fault if you get your hair done - and clothe Coco! - Come shopping, you’ll see. Yeah, I’ll go window-shopping! What? - How much? - How much what? How much do you ask? Thank you. This game’s taking forever! I know! It’s there! That’s it, Coco. Coco’s right. - Go on. - No, here. - Forget it, Albertine. - She’s right. No, Albertine’s not right. - It’s there. - Oh, no! Coco, bravo! Let’s do it again. Watch closely. - Nothing. - Okay, empty. Okay, empty. - There it is. See it? - Yes. Here we go. I’m concentrating. He’s confused me now. - You’re confusing us. - I’m just going a bit faster. - So? - Middle. - This one? - No, that one. I’m not sure. - Coco’s right. - Is she? I said the same. I have something for you. - Okay, Julien was right, too. - We’ll make you lose now. I’ll get the cake. It’s well done. It’s nice work. It still looks brand-new. Student! ...20. Riton’s cake! It’s on the house. - What’ll we drink? - Champagne! - Blow ’em out. - Coco, help me. There are so many! 1... 2... 3... Happy birthday. A gift. Thanks, Coco! - Great. - Beautiful. Well done, Coco. I’m spoiled. Thanks, Coco. “My new freedom imprisons me and paralyzes me... “Or else, I would walk for a long time “and we would make love, “my Julien.” And best of all: “It’s better to suffer than be indifferent.” Bitch! If you don’t write like you talk, you have truths to hide! “My heart explodes “in reminiscence.” You pain in the ass, Nini! - Calm down, Albertine. - No, I won’t. - Calm down. - Get off me. Now, stop it! Come with us! - I should stop? - Yes. - What did you tell her? - Stop it! She’s drunk! - I don’t care! What’d you tell her?! - We have no choice. - I have a choice. - We have no choice. If I go back there, I’ll die or kill her. I love you, Julien. I only love my mother. - Where’s Sophie? - Go to bed. It’s not time. We’re going to the hospital tomorrow. The lady next door said Dad’s not there. He’s in the hospital, as you see every Saturday. Believe what your mother tells you. If the neighbors say anything else, tell them... they’re suckers and we’re crooks. Your husband will go to the hospital if he’s bad. From Algeria, over to you, Paris... Shit! Come on. Cops everywhere. You’ll never make it. They’re too busy hassling Algerians. You have no worries with your Swedish look! I’ll find you a new hideout, and patch things up with Nini. Don’t talk to her, whatever you do. I didn’t think it’d be like this. I’ll leave Riton my number, so we can meet. Look out, Albertine. For yourself and others. Stay in Paris and wait for me. I’ll be back soon. Weren’t you in Doullens a year ago? - Remember me? - No. - What’re you doing here? - Same as you. It’s full up here. - It doesn’t look it. - I’m telling you. And it’s no place for young girls. Try Rita’s. - Rita? - Rita, 46 Rue de la Fontaine. Rita loves girls who are starting out. I do all he tells me. Well, apparently not. So, either you do all Mr. René tells you, or you take a hike! Yeah, right! - So, where were you before? - In Lyon. Some girl sent you here? Yeah, in a dance hall not far from here. And you hit it off? Exactly. We hit it off. I’d like to hit it off with you. Why not? Goodbye, sir. - You get your teeth fixed. - Tell it to my horse! The key! Thanks. Sophie, it’s Riton. Meet you-know-who at 3 today. - 3 o’clock? - At the 3 Billards in Neuilly. - Neuilly? - Yes, the 3 Billards. Let me write that down. - Yes? - 27 Rue des Graviers. Neuilly. Take a taxi, okay? - I won’t walk there! - Don’t yell at me. - Why didn’t Julien call? - Aren’t you pleased to hear me? You’re wrong. I jump for joy at your voice! I’ll call you more often, then! So, you noted down 3 o’clock? 3 o’clock, I got it. It’s 12. I have plenty of time. I better stop chatting, then! - Bye. - Talk soon. Men’s words and caresses make me forget I’m not that pretty, not that nice. If you jerks had seen me before when I was intact and unloved, if you see me tomorrow when I’m healed of everything, except for love. Same again, please. Same again, please. Thanks. Excuse me. Same again. Yeah, I can see, they’re daisies. Forgive me. Forgive you for what? I bought a car. So? Did it break down? Can I have a glass of red wine? No, the guy told me his life story. Then, I had a hard time getting the papers. You’ve been here all this time? It doesn’t matter. I’m at home anywhere. In a hotel, at the beach... In a bar. Even in prison. What counts is that you’re here. Am I fooling myself? No, I’m not fooling you. Why are you laughing? No reason. Close your eyes. Hang on. Close your eyes. You can open them now. Anne? No. Annick? Anne-Marie? Anne-Marie! - Was she old? - No idea. We’ll never know. - You stole it from a store? - That’s none of your business. Annette. Albertine. I prefer you as a brunette. I prefer you. Thank you. 1,000, right? 3,000. 3,000, okay, but you take all your clothes off. Okay. Where did you find this fence? Look, Julien, it’s not my fault if the guy’s late. I’m pissed off as it is, so don’t rub it in. Got any change? No, I’m waiting for it. - It’s for the phone. - Again?! You spend your life on the phone. It’s for that girl again. Just give me some change. I’m stone broke. What has that girl done to you? - Forget it. - Oh, yeah? I’m too dumb to understand, am I? - If Catherine finds out-- - Butt out, Marcel! What’s your problem?! You’re a pain in the ass, Julien! - Call Riton about the fence. - I asked for change to call Riton! About time! Thanks! Riton, it’s Julien. Had any news of Sophie? No, she wasn’t there. Okay. Okay. So? Are you jealous or what? Jealous, me? You’re crazy. Jealous of a girl? I don’t know how old she is. How old is she? - Maybe she’s underage. - What difference would it make? - She’s underage, as well? - As well as what? “As well as what?” Are you having a laugh? Very funny! You find a cripple who broke out of jail, you hide her, and you say that? I’m not asking you for a solution. Good! I don’t have any, ’cause I have no problems! Well, that girl’s my problem. So, get off my damn back! Mind your own business! Unbelievable! For months, I’ve heard Nights and midnights striking And trucks stealing High speed from the road... What? It’s the start of a poem. Come in. - ’Morning, miss. - ’Morning. Thank you. - Need anything else? - No. Julien, come on. I’m hungry! Fig... It reminds me of Algeria as a kid. Can you hear it in your head? Jelila... Leila... Samia... No, we had plain old strawberry jam! I hear: “Isabelle, Martine, Nathalie, get inside now!” To hell with Martine and Marie-Chantal! If you haven’t head from me in a week, change hotels. When’ll I see you? Change hotels, that’s all. It’s nearly 9 o’clock. I’ll have a smoke, then go. Your train’s not till 11:04. I’m keeping it. Julien, I don’t like being loved either as I never learned to pay. Since you taught me, it’ll have to be paid for. Do you have a light? You’ll pay for my love, I swear. I could destroy my love in seconds if I had to, through willpower. I hang onto it like a kid lost in the rocks, because it’s source, goal, and reason. Thank you. I don’t care at all... about suffering. Suzy! Don’t you recognize me? Come sit down. I didn’t recognize you as a blonde! - Is that Maryline? - Yeah. You got her back from state custody? Yes... Well, no. Before I got out, they gave her to a nanny. I have her on Saturdays. At least I have some peace. You out for good now? Only on parole. What about the father? To think I didn’t want her... It’d have been a pity. - Still crazy about cars? - That’s over. With the kid, I quit all that. Pity. We could’ve worked together. You can’t even drive. But I can open them. Oh, no, it’s too dangerous. I just do a bit of hustling, that’s enough. What’re you up to? I walk a lot, change neighborhoods. I don’t make much... but I’m doing okay. Yeah, you mustn’t get caught while on parole. - What’re you thinking? - Nothing. Nothing at all. If you like, I could take you somewhere... you’ll stop thinking sad thoughts. Is there such a place? Oh, yeah. - Don’t you want to? - I’ve never tried. No kidding? We’ll have to change that. Is that your hair or a wig? I don’t know if blonde suits you. Well, I know. We won! Here we are. - Coming tomorrow? - We’ll see. Well, what do you think of him? - He’s okay... - But what? At least he’s not engaged. I like him. Think his parents will like Maryline? Oh, you’re no fun! I didn’t say we’d get married. - What’d you tell him you studied? - Accounting. Good, huh? Yeah, that’s good. Sophie... Yes? - Don’t you remember me? - No. Should I? Well... I went with you a month ago over by Les Halles. So? Did you lose something? No. I’ve looked for you for a week. I stayed the night. You’ve only looked for me for a week! Well, I was traveling. - Okay... - Can I buy you a drink? Not now. I’m busy. - You want to carry on working? - Yes... Tell me what you’d have earned, and I’ll give it to you. Come tomorrow. We’ll see. - Will you be here? - I said so. She said so! I have to hurry up. Accounts won’t wait. Especially today. It’s pay day tomorrow. Poor darling! My glasses... - Did you like it? - None of your business. I’ll give you my number. Yeah, whatever. Roger... - What did you say? - Roger. That’s my name. Okay, well, I’ll be going. Yeah. Well, there we are. Roger... - No! - Don’t move, the sun’s out. - I have to take it. - No! I just have to take your photo. Am I a bookseller? I’ll just take a quick one. - Please don’t! - The sun’s behind you now. - Stop it. - Don’t sulk. You’re beautiful. It’s a nice day. You don’t have to buy the photo. - I don’t want to. - I’m upset. You look sad, it makes me sad. - Off you go. - Okay, I’m going. A quickie. If the sun’s behind you, there’s no point. - Please! - I’m going, I’m going. Does your ankle hurt? Turn around for a quick photo. Turn around for a quick photo! There... Take your sunglasses off. - Be quick, then. - That’s good. Look at me. Lean your head. There... Another one. Don’t move, don’t move... And a third one just in case. I always do three shots. I’m known as Jacky 3 Shots! Jacky 3 Shots... - There. - No more. You don’t have to buy the photo, but if you like it, it’s number 45. Won’t you dance? No, Etienne, I twisted my ankle. Better now? I like this music. It drives away evil spirits. It makes me think of him even more. Not even the mambo can help you! Police! Sir, go back down. Go on down. Would what? Idiot! Keep still. You make me dizzy. She can do what she likes! Shut up and give me your money. I don’t get you. Are you with them? Why do you say that? I thought so. You thought wrong. Just ’cause they’re Arabs, they don’t deserve beating up. Why were you there? I met that guy in a bar. He took me to that club for a dance. - His name? - His first name’s Jean-Paul. What’s his job? He writes. Writes what? A book on nausea. Don’t mess with me. Are those cells empty? I think so. The number of your hotel. 911! Martinez, give us a hand, dammit! - What about the girls? - To hell with ’em! Come on. Same again. No answer, sir. Do you know if she came in? I don’t know, sir, but there’s no answer. What does sir desire? Is everything okay? No, everything’s not okay. Since you came, you haven’t spoken to me. You spend ages on the phone, you don’t even look at me. You sit down, you... And I have to listen to that sucker. Catherine, be nice and get me a glass of red. Who was on the phone? It was Riton. Who else would it be? You call him a lot. Yeah, I call Riton a lot. If it’s a chick, I swear I’ll find out who she is, - she’ll be in trouble. - Stop swearing this and that! I’m here. I work as hard as you. What more do you want? You have all you need. You don’t want for anything. Get off my back. Hello. Julien... Excuse me. Tonight, I loved all men in your name. This fear of males, this unyielding refusal, the strange and unknown all melted into joy. This desperate joy you gave me forever... What indifference, their pleasure. In vain I’ll look among theirs for your words, your voice, your skin. You who hurt me and made me happy a bit more each time, I don’t cry. Not even. Maybe tomorrow we’ll have surrendered, maybe never, maybe the road, the two of us. Never mind. There’s no land for our journey. Have you left Petit Noailles? It was hell: jealous girls and trouble with the guys. Lousy! Scottish joke: A taxi hits a tree. 12 dead. What? What’s funny? - 12 Scots! - 1 taxi! - So? - Don’t you know the Scots? What are they like? - They’re stingy. - Like Auvergne folk. So, what’s funny? - Where are you from? - Clermont. He’s from Auvergne, that’s why. Yeah, he can’t understand! The wind plays like a gypsy Those old bewitching refrains Open your arms so that I may huddle I need to be caressed Open your arms so that it may happen The miracle I’ve dreamed of New words I wish I could invent words That I’ve never said before Joyful, tender, resonant words New words To sing as I see fit The finest love of my life Your blue eyes, your fair eyes Your burning hands, your loving hands Your bright smile which fascinates me New words I am looking for But here comes dawn And leaning over your big closed eyes I just say I adore you! My train leaves tomorrow. Did you hear me? - My train leaves tomorrow. - Why? I have to go to Cherbourg to sign on. - Then you come back. - No, I’m broke. I have money. I don’t want your whoring money! Come to Cherbourg. We’ll be happy there. Marie, I met someone. Good, you have a pimp. That’s not it. He saved me: the hideouts, the hospital, all that. Is this him, too? So? I love him. Yeah. I love him, too – he saved you. Stop it. Don’t pretend not to understand, Marie. I really love him. I love you more than him. It only took me 3 days to find you. Come to Cherbourg. Come with me. You have nice legs. - Look at them in the mirror. - Yeah... Right leg of a pinup, left leg of a doll! Cut it out, it’s annoying. I like you, you know. You’re different. Why not stop streetwalking? - That’s not you. - What do you know about me? I can give you what you want. No, unfortunately, you can’t give me what I want. - Come on, then. - Wait. Don’t turn the light off. I can’t take any more. I just can’t. I cry with joy to think of you. All I do is to show you I don’t need you. It’s to try to keep my love in check, to keep it calm. It works for a few days, then suddenly, the lack, the burning desire, the certainty that we’ll meet... that we have to, at any cost. It’s killing me. I should’ve been careful when you made love to me. I should’ve hugged you less. I cling on too tight. Not even death would open my fingers. Tell me you’ll come back. Tell me, tell me... I’ve told you, I haven’t seen him. - Why would I lie? - Let’s not keep going over it. No, let’s stop. Go home, have a rest, and calm down. You calm down, too. You two piss me off! I won’t go till I know. - Let’s go. He won’t budge. - I’m staying. I’m staying till I find out! You go if you want. Tell her something and get it over with. What if you know where he is? Ah, so you do know! That’s right. Julien’s busted. He’s busted what? He got busted. You sobering up now? Where is he? No idea. Some jail up north. They’re sticking all the local holdups on him. I’ll send him some money. No need. What do you mean? Someone’s already helping him. - Someone’s already helping him? - Yes. Who’s that, then? A girl’s sending him money. Now you know. Let’s go. A girl? A girl’s helping him! Thank you. No! Marie! Give it back! Stop it! I don’t want Sophie! I love Albertine! Sophie loves you too. No, she stinks! Marie! Albertine! I love you! I love you! Silly! Where are we going? You never wrote anything so beautiful to me. You never hurt me like he did. Hurt? Yes, hurt. The pain in my foot... I can put it down and go away from it... but that pain... there’s no drug or escape. It twists and makes your whole body groan. I’m hungry. It’s noon. I’ll get some food. Take some money from my purse. “Stealing is like love. “Gestures which leave us dazzled.” Isn’t it what you told me? Hello, Ma’am. Hello, miss. - Jacqueline? - Coming. Good grief! My sausage! Thief! - Get off me! - Calm down. - Jacqueline, call the police! - Okay. Where’s that from? It says on it. Silly me. I hadn’t thought of that. Paris. It says Paris... a city you’re banned from. I rested up there when I got out of jail. Is that forbidden? Did you rest up with your friend Albertine? Albertine? Which Albertine? Maybe I got the name wrong. Let me check. “On December 18, 1953, Albertine Damien and Marie Lefèvre “entered Miss Chausson’s clothes store.” You remember the rest, I presume. It does say Albertine and Marie. - You know she broke out? - No kidding? She broke out of jail? She’s blonde now. Pretty, isn’t she? - It’s a pity that photos can’t talk. - More than you. Shit! Look out! - Who is it? - It’s me, Uncle, it’s Sophie. Come in. Suzy... - Maryline? - No, it’s Albertine. Suzy, what’s that? What’s what? I’ve lost Marie. I have nowhere to sleep. Oh, yeah? Where? Lie down. Have a rest. I need to hide, Suzy. I see. Lie down. You rest. Did you go to the swimming pool? Yes, I did. 2nd or 3rd floor? Police! Make an effort, Suzy. Give me the name of just one dealer, I’ll let you go. First, I don’t know any. Secondly, my memory’s gone. It used to go... just for a few minutes, but now it’s like a big black hole in my head. With partitions everywhere and no-one ever meets? Yeah. You’ve been there? It’s like... a very chic maze. That’s enough. Where’s the dope from? China, the Balkans? No idea. I go there like a machine, automatically. I’m getting fed up with the sight of you. Where’s it from? - Where? - No idea. It can come from your ass if it’s good! Does your pimp see middlemen, or don’t you have a pimp? The guy who could take my money hasn’t been born! No need to force yourself to talk crap! So, where’s your kid at the moment? - In the country. - She won’t stay long if you don’t talk. - Don’t touch my kid. - So, talk. First, I arrive. Then, I smoke. No, first, I... First, I pay. Okay, you’ve wasted enough of my time. Talk, and I’ll let you go. If you don’t, I’ll lock you up and put your kid in state custody. There’s one thing I can tell you. Try me. There’s a girl on the run. Well, there you go! I’m sorry about last time. I couldn’t reach you. And we were burglarized. We were at the movies. Coco won’t sleep alone now. She’s afraid I’ll be taken to the hospital like Dédé. Anyway, I was in such a state. Here’s a letter from Julien. Albertine... You may not believe me, but I worry about you. We’ll be together, but I don’t know when, or how. I haven’t been tried yet. If I get hit hard, I’ll just do a runner. With you, I almost prefer being on the run. No need to read it to you? What else? He gets out on June 21. Where’s the jail? - I’m not sure. - Up north, right? I don’t know. I’ll go. He doesn’t want you to turn up. I won’t go to the gates. I’m not that stupid! I’ll wait in some bar in town. No, it’s complicated. Stop it. - It’s ’cause of the girl? - What girl? Riton told you not to tell me. - It’s none of my business! - Their “business”? What’s her name? What good will it do you? None at all. But not knowing does me harm. Catherine. What’s she like? She’s nothing like you. Meaning? She’s blonde. Anyway... Julien said to meet him after the 21st. The 24th. I have nothing on, that day. It’s St John’s Eve, Midsummer’s Day. - Where do we meet? - In some hole in Normandy. - Normandy? - You’re to meet him in Normandy. I wrote it on a piece of paper. It’s by the seaside. That’s a good place to meet. Blainville-sur-Mer. There’s only one café. Thanks. You can stay till then. That’s nice, but no. Being nice won’t wipe the slate clean? Let’s stay friends now that we’ve made up. Same again, please. Thanks. Hello. I was early, for once. You okay? Hello, Albertine. Hello, Julien. “For months, I’ve heard Nights and midnights striking...” What came next? Whose car is this? My brother-in-law’s. Has Catherine been in it? Answer me. Has Catherine been in it? - I don’t care about her. - I do! - I don’t wanna talk about her. - Who is she? I slept at her place when I went through Beauvais. She bought everyone at home: my mother, my sister’s kids. She’d bring clothes, toys, flowers. She’s an honest girl, she has a regular job, she’s my age. They want us to marry. I’m not good enough to join the clan, am I? I’m not old enough or ugly enough or blonde enough? Why do you give so much importance to it? You seemed so strong, so tough. It’s over. Tomorrow it’ll be us. But yesterday, Julien... it was her! She was at the prison gates! You gave her your first moments of freedom, not me! What am I in all this? You’re my secret. I’ll kill her. But why? I don’t love her. I never will. It’s easier to kill a body than a memory. It’ll at least stop others. - Other what? - Other memories. If you tell her about me... or she realizes you’re leaving her... she’ll discover a bun in the oven or something. Beware of girls. I know what they’re like. I’m one, I can expect anything of them. Thanks for hurting me so bad. - That’s for you. - Albertine... You didn’t see that for months in Paris, and years elsewhere... I morbidly enjoyed sex. I chased after money as it gives the illusion of possessing things. I did all the harm I could to destroy what made me jealous. I stamped on every dull hope. I broke what I might have adored. All that was spoiled. I could tense up for hours, pass as a hard bitch, lost, and beyond redemption. I’ve done every dirty trick, every debauchery. How could you not sense it was all a failure? That my heart was dying for love and melted at beauty? That hatred turned to indifference inside me? And that I was playing my last card on love? And that I could never backtrack? Never mind. I want to believe till the very end. Please forgive me. For what? For that girl. I wish you had to wait for me as I waited for you. I love you. PARIS, JUNE 25, 1958 - Are you coming? - No. You’re not? I’ll leave her now. Now? After all that driving? I didn’t drive, and I’m exhausted. I don’t care. I won’t let you doubt me one more night. I’d been thinking of doing so for a while, but it took your letters this morning to convince me. I’ll be at her place by midnight. Stay with me, Julien. I’ll be here at 7 a.m. tomorrow. Wait for me one last time. Miss? You asked to be woken at 6. Thank you. Leave it there. There you are. Enjoy your breakfast. That day in June 1958, Albertine had 7 years in prison to serve and 9 years of love with Julien whom she married in prison. Her first novel, L’Astragale, was a hit. She died on July 10, 1967, aged 29, after a medical error.
