Nice little town, Konigsbaden. Glad you like it, Mein Herr. Can I get you something? Yes, a beer. Oh, Fraulein. Make it two. Operator, about that London call of mine, I have the name now. I wish to speak personally with Mr. Newman. Mr. Joe Newman. N-E-W... One minute. Thank you. Wonderful air in these mountains. Just like wine. Are you a tourist? I wish I was. Business. Well? I spoke to him. I think you are making a mistake, Herr Brenner. We will have to wait and see, won't we? What did you tell him? Like you said. He will come here to the hotel. And then? He will ask for Kurt Deutsch. Fine. But how do we know he'll come? To see Kurt Deutsch? He must. Good afternoon, sir. I'd like a room. Yes, sir, for how long? It depends. Oh, you are from England? That's what it says. Just here, Mr. Newman. Room 12 first floor. I think you'll find it suitable, sir. It overlooks the square. Any messages for me? Message, sir? From a man called Deutsch. Deutsch I don't think anyone of that... It wouldn't be Kurt Deutsch, would it? Yes, it would why? But, he's dead. I'm very sorry, sir. When did he die? Last week. You hadn't heard? No. I heard he died 20 years ago. I don't understand, sir. Just send a bottle of whisky to my room, would you? Yes, sir. Come in. You asked for whisky, sir? Thank you. Mind if I make up the bed? No, help yourself. The sun too strong for you in here, sir? What? I was wondering why you wear those dark glass. Well, I got a bit of dirt in my eye, when I was a kid. Kastelwal where is that? The Deutsch house? You know it? It's about three kilometres from here. All right, thanks. Are you a friend of the family? No, I was. Poor woman. Everyone's very sorry for her. - What woman? - The widow. You didn't know he was married? No. They say she's very upset. So am I. Looking for someone? Is this the Deutsch house? It's up there. What do you want? I want to speak to Mrs. Deutsch. Mrs. Deutsch isn't receiving callers. Why not? Her husband died last week. Yeah, I know. That's why I want to see her. What do you mean? He was my father. Mrs. Deutsch. Will you come in, please. What name, sir. Newman. Can I help you? Mrs. Deutsch? She'll be here soon. I am Mrs. Gelman the housekeeper. Martha Gelman? You know me? I used to. I am sorry. Your name is Newman? It used to be Deutsch. Joachim Deutsch. Joachim? Kurt's boy? I changed my name when my mother died. Joachim. Little Joachim. It's not possible! Oh, you were so little. Just a child. I can't believe it, a grown man, and all these years, I've had to think of you as you were that morning. Oh, it all seems a lifetime ago. You were just a little boy holding your mother's hand in the train, and poor Kurt in his uniform watching you go. They told me he was killed in action in 1942. No, Joachim. He was taken prisoner. He escaped two years ago. Look I have kept all the papers. Yes, I've been reading them. He was quite a hero. He had a terrible time, Joachim. Six prisoners broke out altogether. Four of them were recaptured the same day. Then when Kurt and his companion got to the mountains they fell in with a patrol, and the other man was killed. Then Kurt had to come on alone in the depths of winter. How long has he been living here, Martha? In Konigsbaden? No, in this house. What became of the sports shop in Stuttgart? It was bombed. He wanted to start all over again, but I told him he needed rest. And you've been with him ever since he came back? The whole time why? What did he get himself mixed up with, Martha? Kurt? Was he in trouble? Trouble? I don't know what you mean. I think you do. No, Joachim, Kurt was not mixed up in anything. He studied a little, read books. He came here to rest. Is that the only reason he came here? He was a sick man, Joachim. He was well enough to remarry. What are you hiding, Martha? What is it you are afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything. Listen, Joachim, I loved your father. I love you, but don't ask me any questions. Now wait a minute until someone phoned me last week, I assumed that my father was dead. He is dead. He died last week. Are you sure? What are you talking about? Is he dead, Martha? Mr. Deutsch? Lisa, this is Joachim. Kurt's boy. - Yes. Yes, I know, Martha. He has come from London. Yes, Martha. Would you please ask Anna to set another place. Yes, but he says that somebody telephoned- Please, Martha. Heinrich told me that you were here, Mr. Deutsch. The name is Newman. Joe Newman. Mine's Deutsch. Lisa Deutsch. This is Peter von Brecht. How are you Joe. I don't suppose you'll remember me. The last time you saw me was at your christening. Oh, yes? You will stay for dinner, Mr. Newman? I'd be delighted, Mrs. Deutsch. Of course, the trouble with Germany today, Joe, is that everyone works too hard for all the wrong reasons. It's a national obsession. Trying to expiate the sins of the past. I didn't know they remembered them. On the contrary. Now you're not a German, Joe. Temperamentally, you're like your mother. You see people eating too much, driving too fast, or talking too loudly and you're fooled. Take it from me. That beneath the shining chromium and the neon lights, the pain and the sickness are still there. I could have been worse, I suppose. Oh, in what way? Well, you could have won the war. - Lisa? - No. You're not drinking, Lisa? I have a slight headache. Perhaps you'd like to lie down? No, thanks. I'm sure Joe will understand. No, I will be all right. As you wish. You haven't told us about yourself, Joe. I remember your father wanted you to be a lawyer. I'm a musician. That's fine. You're in an orchestra? In a jazz group I play piano. Well, I'm sure Kurt would have approved. How do you like the liqueur? Oh, it's fine. It's pre-war. I've only got one more bottle left in the cellar. This is your house? Yes, it's a bit of a Gothic monstrosity. It's been in the family for years. Whose did you think it was? The maid at the hotel called it, "the Deutsch house." Peter suggested that Kurt and I should live here. Kurt needed looking after. The place was empty. Kurt needed rest, the quiet of the mountains, complete seclusion. That was a generous thought. I considered it my duty. Kurt was in my regiment in the war. I'm afraid nowadays the simple canine virtues of loyalty mean very little. How did he die, Lisa? Kurt? Was he ill long? He collapsed suddenly. - His heart? - Cerebral haemorrhage. He never really recovered from the escape. His whole constitution was completely- Did he say anything? What do you mean? Before he died? What about? Anything about me? No. I don't know. You weren't with him? He was unconscious. For how long? A day, two days. Look does it really matter? I'm interested. Why? What are you trying to imply? Lisa. Why is he asking all these questions? What is he doing here? Now, Lisa, please Kurt was Joe's father. Joe, I understand your concerns. I sympathise, but please accept my word, as your father's best friend. Everything that could be done was done. He had the best medical attention in the land. He was nursed night and day. By you, Lisa? No, not by me. In a hospital. - Lisa Joe's a guest! I'm sorry, Joe. I'm afraid we've all had more than our share this past week. You must excuse us. Of course. Oh, there's no need to go. You haven't drunk your coffee. I've had a long day. I'll get Heinrich to drive you back. There's one more thing, Lisa. Heinrich? Bring the car around, please. I want you to drive Mr. Newman back to his hotel. Yes. Do you mind if I keep this? Of course not. It is yours. I'm sorry if I upset you, Lisa. That is all right. You wanted to know what I was doing here? Well, I was sent for. Sent for? But that's impossible. A man phoned me in London. Said he was in trouble. Asked me to get here right away. What man? He said his name was Kurt Deutsch. Reception. I'd like Konigsbaden Hospital please. Hello. I want to make some inquiries about a patient of yours. What name please? Kurt Deutsch. Hello. Hello, are you there? Yes, sir? Did you have a patient called Kurt Deutsch? We have instructions to give information to relatives only. - I'm his son. - One minute, sir. I'll put you through to Dr. von Brecht. Just a second, Miss. Yes? What name was that? Dr. von Brecht, our director. Peter von Brecht? That's right, sir. I'll see if he's in. Don't bother, Miss. He's not in. All right? Of course, it will look different again when it is permanent. Get a bit of figured marble up there or a scroll or an angel, surprising what it does. Takes the bareness out of it. Why wasn't my father buried in Konigsbaden? I beg your pardon? Well, why did they bring him a hundred miles to Stuttgart? Oh, well, he was born here, sir. I assume it was his wish. Now, I'll just get you to sign the old visitor's book. I like to get things done in black and white. Now today's date. Who was at the burial? Oh, the burial? Oh, the lady. What lady? Oh, the widow Mrs. Deutsch. As a matter of fact, she left her gloves here. I was going to post them off. So there was no one else? Not at the actual interment. Although I understand there was quite a gathering at the other end. Speaking just for myself, I think it adds a sad touch when there's only one representative of the bereaved. How did the body come here? By rail I don't suppose you want the details. I do. I assure you everything- If you don't mind. Not at all. Ah, here. Kurt Josef Deutsch: Deceased proceeded by rail from Konigsbaden for interment at 15:30 hours. Deceased arrived at 11:01 as per schedule and was transferred by civic transport for forward passage to the grounds. The service was officiated over by Father Waldo Hahn. On completion of the service- Father Hahn? Of the Church of the Sacred Heart. Are you sure? It's here in black and white. Where do I sign? Just here. Thank you. Thank you. I'll deliver these. The Church of the Sacred Heart that is a Catholic church, isn't it? Oh, yes, sir, you've no need to worry about that. I'm not worried. I'm surprised. You see, my father was a Protestant. Now let's have the name. Fritzi. Fritzi. It's on her collar. Your name, boy! They said there was a reward. Look just give me the name. Karel Eisler. Karel Eisler. You're from the refugee camp, huh? Yes, I am. I thought so. They said they were giving 10 marks to get her back. Come in. I'm Inspector Hofmeister. This is Sergeant Hirsch. Take a seat, Herr Neumann. The name is Newman. Oh, yes, of course. You're of English nationality. Weren't you happy as a German? I was nine years of age when the war broke out. Joachim Deutsch is not an English name. So you decided to become a new man. When did this baffling mystery begin, Herr Newman? What baffling mystery? Kurt Deutsch rang you four days after he died. You arrived when? You know when, you saw me. Just answer my questions, Neumann. I arrived at 12 o'clock I checked into the hotel. I thought I'd change my shirt. I decided against it. I went to the Deutsch house. That's better. What time? In the afternoon. You can't remember the time? 4:27. You stayed for dinner? Yes. What time did you leave? What are you doing, making a timetable? You've put in an official request for a man's body to be disinterred! Do you want to withdraw it? Do you have any further questions, Inspector? Martha Gelman you're telling me she's been intimidated by Lisa Deutsch? All right, Eisler. But the reward? We will let you know if there's a reward. But they said if- We will let you know! Now beat it. And what am I supposed to do with this brute? If no one claims it in six months, it's yours. Hello. Yes. I was beginning to think you had fallen into one of your own graves. Have you got them? Mm-hmm. Seppa. And Baum? Thank you. What do you imagine was in the coffin? Stones, books? You tell me! Anything further to add? What more do you want? I'm waiting for one thing that I can take to the Stuttgart authorities, and say, "Dig up Kurt Deutsch's grave." Well, my father was a Protestant. They buried a Catholic. You haven't seen or heard of him for 20 years. He could have changed his religion. I doubt it. Let's stick to facts. I say he could. Oh, he could! He could have been buried in Stuttgart, sneaked out to fool me, and then sneaked back in again! No, Newman, he couldn't have done that. You've got a point, Inspector. I'll see you get promotion. Sit down, Newman. There's a man who's parked his car on the wrong side of the square! Why don't you go run him in? Sit down! Don't know who you are or what you're playing at, Newman. You've made a serious charge. You've accused two respectable citizens of a major crime, and I intend to examine your allegations in detail. There's nothing to examine. There's a plot it's obvious. I don't know what it is! But I do know that Lisa Deutsch and von Brecht are in it up to here! Seppa and Baum also? Seppa and Baum who are they? Two cemetery officials who screwed down the lid of the coffin on poor Kurt Deutsch's body and escorted it from Konigsbaden to Stuttgart. You're saying you refuse to investigate? I'm telling you that your talk of conspiracy is rubbish. Your father’s dead, Newman. You refuse to open the grave? There are no grounds. He died a natural death. He gave a small party for a few friends and he collapsed. A competent doctor diagnosed a cerebral haemorrhage, and Kepler, the leading neurologist of the land, examined him and signed the death certificate. The doctors were right. Two days later, Kurt Deutsch was buried at Stuttgart, wept over by a loved wife. He'll stay buried. Who told you about the party? Nobody. I was there. My father invited you? No. Lisa did. Thank you, Inspector. Where are you going? As you say, Inspector, it's a small town. Hold it Newman! Check that man's passport. Lisa told you I was coming? You upset her. She's really hurt. I can give you advice, Herr Newman. I don't need it. Go back to your own country. Yeah, thanks. Work it out. Why should a nice woman like Lisa Deutsch get mixed up in a crime? You know who Dr. von Brecht is? Santa Claus. There's a displaced persons camp up the road. He looks after it, and he takes no money for it. That's very nice of him. Use your head. Why should anyone want to make out your father is dead, and then keep him alive? Where's the sense of it? Maybe I'll ask Martha that. Martha Gelman? So you think she can sort this whole thing out for you? Why shouldn't she? It is you that needs sorting out, Newman. Martha is Lisa's mother. Reception. Have my bill ready, please. What are you leaving, sir? Yes, I'm leaving. Reception. Konigsbaden 136, please. One moment, sir. Konigsbaden 136. I want to speak to Mrs. Deutsch, please. I'm afraid Mrs. Deutsch isn't here. Well, this is Joe Newman. Would you tell her that I'm going home, and that I'll leave her gloves at the hotel. Gloves? What gloves? Her black gloves. She left them in Stuttgart at the cemetery. I don't understand. They can't be Mrs. Deutsch's. She never went to the cemetery. What was that? I said, Mrs. Deutsch didn't go to Stuttgart. Nobody went from here. Hello. Hello? Mr. Newman, hello. I think it adds a sad touch, when there's only one representative of the bereaved. They can't be Mrs. Deutsch's. She never went to the cemetery. Mrs. Deutsch didn't go to Stuttgart. Nobody went from here. Hello, Mr. Newman. Looking for someone? A girl. Any special girl? About size six. You got any ideas? It depends. What do you like? Blonde or brunette? A widow. I don't understand. You off duty? Yes Well, let's dance. What do you do in England? I play in a band. I bet you're very good. Oh, I'm better than good Louis thinks I'm the greatest. Louis Armstrong? No, no, Louis Schwartz. Who is he? My agent. You're a funny man, Mr. Newman. You don't like me? I can never tell when you are serious. I'm serious. You make jokes, but you never smile. Why? Well, maybe I'm maladjusted. I really don't understand you. Come on, let's explore a mountain. At this time of night? You tell me a better time. I'll just get my bag. Waiter Okay. I'm ready. That man over there do you know him? Herr Brenner he's one of the guests. At this hotel? Yes, he's got the room next to yours. Where are you going? Oh, I'm sorry, Helga, the mountain will have to wait. Pardon. Am I in the wrong room? I think you had better move away from that window. It gets chilly these evenings. Sit down, Herr Newman. I imagine we have got some business to talk over. That's a nice business card. It has its advantages. For instance, in my line of work, it helps me decide whether I am dealing with partners or competitors. What exactly is your line of work? I think you know the answer to that, Herr Newman. Fraud. Any more questions? How much is a million Deutschmarks in English money? Quite a lot. But I warn you. It is a little academic at this stage. You aren't going to pay? You know, Herr Newman, we had a case last year in Hamburg. A leading citizen, not old, a pillar of society suddenly passed away. There was a most spectacular funeral with more than 500 mourners, even a wreath from the mayor. A real tragedy. So? A miracle occurred. Some of our people ran into him a month later on the beach in Biarritz. He had worked up quite a tan. Is that what you were doing in Stuttgart Cemetery? Waiting for a miracle? I have become the chief investigator of my company because I am a born sceptic. Any more questions? You phoned me in London. Not me, a colleague. Why? Frankly, Herr Newman, because in the circumstances, I had no alternative. Do you object? Well, that depends. Depends on what? You think my father might be a crook! You don't seem to understand the point of my story. I think that he may still be alive. Don't you? You've got a funny way of doing business, Brenner. If Kurt Deutsch is still alive, I can't think of a better candidate to find him than his own son. Even though he's involved in an insurance swindle. Now look, Joe, we know for a fact that when your father got back, he was a broken man. You know what he went through. I read about the escape. Oh, no, no, you can't dismiss it just like that. When his friend Schiller was killed, he walked on alone for nearly six days without anything to eat in the depths of winter. An ordeal like that doesn't leave a man with much will, with much resistance. What are you getting at, Brenner? You've seen Lisa. You've seen von Brecht. I say he was a victim. Is that your company's view? It is my view, and I speak with 20 years experience. I've got a pair of gloves to put in the kitty what've you got? I can raise you, Joe. I have got Maria Wienewski. Who's she? She's the girl they belong to. Pow, pow. Pow. Hey! Hey, come on! Reach. Hello, Karel. How's the dog? Who are you? A policeman? Did you get that reward? No, they wouldn't give it to me. Maria Wienewski? Who are you? I came about your father. He's dead. He died last week. I know. Stroke, wasn't it? Yes. You brought my papers? No, I came to return these. Thank you. Where did you find... Who are you? I'm Kurt Deutsch's son. Now listen to me I came to find my father! - Go away! - You know where he is! I don't know anything! You're lying! No, help! Look you're gonna tell me or you're going to tell the police! Leave me alone! You know something and you're going to tell me! No! What the devil's going on here? He broke in and attacked Maria. All right, all right come on. - But, Doctor- - All right, Magda. I'll handle it. Come on get out! What are you after, Joe, money? Call the police! I've already called them. What's going on? Konigsbaden 136. No, it is Mrs. Gelman. Shall I fetch her? Oh, I see. No, we'll be here. You will let us know what happens? Goodbye. Will you give me a drink, Heinrich? Yes. How is he? I wish he were dead. That is not a nice thing to say, Lisa. You've had a better life than I've had, and you will have a better one still when this is over. Where? In jail? This it? You were at the funeral? Who else was there? Three or four people. Your mother? Why not? She died three years ago. Okay. Let us go. Who buried him? Radizski, the camp undertaker. Give me the history, Herr Doctor. He had a stroke on Sunday afternoon. Died the following morning. What time? Between 1:00 and 2:00. In your clinic? No, at this camp in his hut. He collapsed suddenly. I examined him and advised Maria to send for a priest. You did what you could, but the poor fellow passed away. I gave him an anti-coagulant. He died without regaining consciousness. What happened then? What do you mean? Don't spar with me, Doctor. I may have to open Wienewski's grave before his daughter's eyes. - No! - It's all right, Maria. Nobody's going to touch the grave. The man's ill, Inspector. His suspicions are paranoid nonsense. He doesn't suspect. He knows, don't you, Newman? I know one thing. That grave out there is empty! He's insane! I'll tell you what happened My father was given something at that party to make him collapse. Wienewski was then taken to the clinic and put in his place. This is ridiculous. Wienewski died here. That specialist you called in Kepler, he examined Wienewski! It's Wienewski who's buried in Stuttgart! I have never listened to such nonsense. Inspector why in heaven's name should I involve myself in a faked burial which could ruin me? If Wienewski's in that coffin, you haven't. Kurt Deutsch was alive when Kepler examined him? Naturally. Why naturally? Otherwise he wouldn't have signed the death certificate. Then if Wienewski died here, as you say he did, it could not have been him that Kepler saw. Kepler didn't know who he saw. Quiet, Newman. That's why they called for him! That's why- - Quiet! Come here. Come on. Were you with your poor daddy when he died? Who told you he was dead? The doctor? I saw. What did you see? His eyes were glazed like this? For God's sake, Hofmeister! It's just a week! What did you see, Maria? He was unconscious. He tried to move suddenly and fell back. How was he breathing? Like this? He wasn't breathing! He was dead! You're wasting time, Hofmeister. I'll decide that. I want facts before I make a young girl look on the dead face of her father! No! This is an act! There's an empty coffin in that grave! Why can't you go back to England and leave us in peace. Well? Radizski took the old man's body from his room up to the hut. Fut it in a coffin and buried it in the morning. Then they must have moved it overnight! It was in the hut all night? The door was locked. Who had the key? Hirsch, the man's asking you a question. Dr. von Brecht had it. Okay, Hofmeister? Don't teach me my damn job! Open it, Hirsch. No! What are you waiting for? I have written out something for you to sign. I hope you'll be able to live with yourself, Newman. It's a trick! Take her away, Doctor. It's the wrong grave! All right, Newman! This is the one they should have opened! Look they moved the flowers! I said all right! I want you in my office. Bag packed in half an hour! That bastard switched the crosses! This is a cemetery! I won't have filthy language! Hirsch! Sergeant. The cuffs! You can't arrest me, Hofmeister! I'm a British subject! You're an undesirable alien! I'm deporting you! You'll be all right in a few minutes. You just lie there quietly. That damned maniac. I could strangle him with my own hands. You won't have to. I must congratulate you, Herr Inspector. Must you? You and your sergeant that was quick thinking. What are you talking about? What happened just now. I must admit for a moment I was worried. Until I realised you'd switched- Do you know how long I've been in the force? Long enough to be in smelling distance of a good fat pension. I'm not going to lose it. I'm not anxious. I served six years, Herr Inspector. I am. I can't wait. I don't think there's any danger. Thinking isn't enough. I intend to make sure tonight. Konigsbaden 136. No, I'll hang on. Get in. Hello, Lisa. Peter speaking. I'm coming over right away. There have been developments. Yes. Yes, that's right. Bye. You didn't tell me, Doctor. Tell you what? That Kurt Deutsch had a son. Now what difference does that make? Why are they arresting him? They're not he's going back to England. But he was handcuffed. Maria. I asked you to do something for me and you've done it. Please leave it at that. What did Hofmeister mean about tonight? You told me- - I know what I told you. - Doctor- - Now listen to me. You're upset. I want you to go straight to your hut and lie down. Her take these. They'll help you sleep. In a couple of hours you'll be- Please, Doctor. The night my father died there was a man- Now that is enough. You can trust me, Maria, you know that. You've been a good girl. Don't spoil it. Just take these and lie down. Maria, I have some good news for you. Your papers have come through. I could be signing them tomorrow. Thank you, Doctor. Musician, are you, Newman? Yeah, a composer. Written anything? Oh, one or two tunes. My big one's to come. What's that? "Mein Kampf'. I'm setting it to music. How much money do you earn, Hirsch? Trying to bribe me? Yes. Look give me a break just till the morning. Look, well, only a couple of hours. What for? To finish what I came here for. You're crazy, Newman. You really are. You know Hofmeister's doing you a favour. What is it? I want to speak to Mr. Newman. Sorry nobody allowed. Joe, I've got to tell you something! Take your hands off her! Never hit a policeman, Joe. It's illegal. Maria, what were you going to tell me? - Joe, there's- - No, not here. You know the boathouse by the lakeside? Old Lindbar's place? - Yes. - I'll see you there. Get out the back way. You all right? I'll live. Just go over what you told me before. There's no point. Tell me! It was 2:00 in the morning when that ambulance came for your father. About then. It was nearly half past when we got to the clinic. And you saw no one else there? - No. - Then the ambulance drove away? - Look, Joe. Look I want to know! It wasn't your father, Joe. Look just stick to the facts. You told me you saw a man. I came to tell you you're wrong. You described him! Listen to me, Joe. Look a man got into that ambulance, an old man! He was forced in now you told me that! Joe, listen. I've known Dr. von Brecht a long time. He's a good man. I am talking about my father! He's dead, Joe, he's dead. I'm trying to help you. By lying. I don't want you to get into any more trouble. You haven't told me anything that I didn't know before. Now get out of here. You're making a mistake, Joe. Trust me, please. Why? I took a risk coming here. I had no need to come. I know why you came here. Here. Give my regards to the good doctor. You're tough, aren't you, Joe. Really tough. You're a slut, Maria! But what's behind those glasses? A little boy and he's crying. All right, I got the message. Here. There's another 20. You were in the camp for two hours, Joe. I was born there. I didn't want to die there too. Is that so terrible? Does that make me a slut? Why don't you answer me, Mr. Newman? I'll answer you, Maria. I don't know if my father is alive or dead, a hero or a crook, I don't even know if I care! All I know is that I've got to find out. Let me help you. You're a surprising man, Joe. Quite versatile. Yeah, I'm fascinating. Did you find out where he is? They took him away in an ambulance. Where to? Now that I'm going to find out. I take it you'll need my professional services. No. But I'll need your gun. You can pour me one. Is Heinrich upstairs? Tell him I want him. Right away, please. Thank God you're here. I was on the point of screaming. It'll soon be over. I wish it had never started. You knew the stakes. But we didn't reckon with Kurt's son. Well, if I thought that- - Stop it, Lisa. You're beginning to irritate me. You can't play with fire without getting burnt. You tell me that? When the war started, I was a 15-year old girl. That's the wrong age and the wrong sex. I tell you one thing. I was never involved in a crime. You're lucky. I'm older than you. I was involved in six million. I'm scared, Peter. It's cold in this house. Car all right? Yes, I just have to take it into town, get it filled up and checked. All right, and that's where you meet the ambulance. It's a clearing on the left of the Munich road, about one kilometre before you get to the autobahn. Yes, sir. The plane's ordered for 10.30. If you leave not later than one hour from now, that'll leave plenty of time to get him on board. Not that there should be any trouble. Right. What is it? What are they saying? They're talking about my father he's in the house. What are you going to do? I'm going in. - But we can't! - Not you! Me. I want you to take a message to Brenner. But, Joe. No, there's no time. Try to remember this. Tell Brenner... It is going to work, Peter, isn't it? Of course. What's the matter with those damned dogs? What's wrong? Newman's out there. Oh, no what are we going to do? Come on. Heinrich, hold it a minute. Mrs. Deutsch and I are coming with you. You can drop us off in the town. Yes, sir. Joachim? What are you doing here? All right, where is he, Martha? I don't understand you. Take me to him. You first. Now get rid of him! Get him out before I kill him! Stop it! You maniac. Listen, Joe, we are trying to help Kurt. You're a tart! You don't understand. Forget it, Lisa, he understands. He understands everything. Don't you, Newman? You're an arrogant swine. I'm sure your father would be really proud of you. Here take that. Where are you going? We've had enough trouble from this young man. Don't waste your sympathy. If he moves from that bed, shoot him. Listen, Joe. He's a beaten old man, Lisa. Was it worth it? Dead on time all right? Sure. You won't get away with this, von Brecht! You're a stupid man, Newman. You've got no mummy and no daddy, and the whole world owes you a living. You talk too much! Oh, for God's sake if only you knew. What's the use? You can't tell him anything. I'm going to put you to sleep. When you wake up, you'll forget all these delusions you've had. I saw him, von Brecht with my own eyes! You saw nobody. Peter. It's the phone. Heinrich something has gone wrong. Otto. What happened? You'd better get out of here while you can, Lisa. What have you done? Give me the gun it could save you five years. What have you done, Joe? Kurt won't be catching that plane. No. Now give me that gun! You don't know what you've done. You just don't know. I've torn up a million-mark check. What are you talking about? I'm talking about insurance. Is that what they told you? Insurance? Nobody told me anything. I saw the policy. You fool. There was no policy. I read it myself. That poor old man. It was in Brenner's room! My father's name was on it! Brenner tricked you. Your father's dead, Joe. You're lying, Lisa! I saw him in this room! He never came back. He died two years ago in the mountains. I told him, Peter. Brenner's got him they're heading for the station. I'm going after them. You satisfied, Newman? But, just a minute. The old man who was he? His name is Schiller, Professor Gustav Schiller. Professor? He's a famous scientist, your father’s friend. They were prisoners together in Russia. Where is Brenner taking him? Where do you think? Passengers for Pilsen, Prague, Wroclaw, and connections for Leningrad and Moscow travel in the small quarters at the front front entryway. Comfortable, Professor? I am all right. You'll feel better once you are back in harness. Will I? We had to come for you you must have known that. Surely Kurt Deutsch's body was not recognisable? He wore my clothes, had my papers. Was that not enough to convince you that Professor Schiller was dead? Why did you have to come here looking for me? We had to make sure. You are an important man, Professor. You can't blame us. I don't blame anyone. We couldn't tell you Newman. You realise that. You didn't trust me? We didn't know you. Whose idea was it? What idea? To change places. Yours or Deutsch's? Does it matter? Just a professional interest. It was Kurt's. He had been shot. He was dying. He offered me the thing I wanted most. Liberty, huh? No, Herr Brenner, anonymity. Thank you. All aboard please. Tickets please. Next stop Nuremberg. Passengers for stations further east, please have papers and passports ready. Tickets please. Nuremberg next stop. Anyone going beyond that? Anything wrong, Inspector? They're all right. The dining car is now open. Light refreshments are now being served in the dining car. Coffee now being served in the dining car. Professor. Coffee? No, thanks. Mind if I have one? You are not afraid I might run away? Here, Professor, read a magazine. I think you've had enough adventures, don't you? I take your point, Herr Brenner. Pus, pus, pus, pus. He's a nice cat. Thank you, it is a she. Her name is Putzi. She loves to travel. You are Newman. Joe Newman. That's right, Professor. It used to be Joachim Deutsch. Sit down, Joe. I have a lot to explain. There's no time, Professor. We're getting off. You, Joe, not me. I have a long journey to make. You've made enough journeys! You don't understand, Joe. You don't understand at all. You're not telling me that you want to go back! I don't want to. I must. Who's forcing you? I am a famous scientist, Joe, a rocket man, a ballistic expert in a world, where bullets rate higher than bread. I have to be exploited by one side or the other. As long as I live, I can't opt out. They won't let me. But if you don't want to make rockets... What has want to do with it? I want to be left alone to live a private life. I want to stroll in a park, ride in a bus, have a drink with a stranger, and know that no one is taking notes. And you think you'll get that where you're going? I shan't get it anywhere now. Last week I was Kurt Deutsch officially dead. Now I am Professor Schiller alive. So, once again I have to become part of a plan. East or West it doesn't matter. But you've got to want harder, Professor! You're not a pawn in a chess game! I wish I were. Unfortunately, I'm piece of vital strategic equipment. And much too valuable to be left lying around. Easy, Joe. - Joe. - I have a job to finish. I'm sorry about the deception, but I had to report whether it was the professor who came back or your father. You understand. You haven't made your report yet? I'm doing better. I'm taking him with me. Why? Listen, Brenner give him a break. Just a minute. Tell them that it was my father! You want me to lie, Joe? No more jokes, Brenner. I'm asking you to give him a chance. Tell them it's my old man who was buried in Stuttgart! They'll believe you! And him? Well, he's nobody. I'll tell you something, Joe. I would like to. But you won't. I cannot. Listen, Professor, a lot of people have stuck out their necks for you! It's no use, Joe. As soon as Herr Brenner reports to his superiors... He can report what he damn well likes! Ah, Leave him alone, boy. He's too old for running. You keep out of this! No, Joe. I've tried and I've failed. I don't want anyone to take any risks, or any more trouble on my account. On your account! I don't even know you! All I know is I've been lied to, tricked, beaten up, and treated like a leper, for reasons I didn't understand! I understand them now! You can't help me. Look my father gave you a chance. I'm going to see you take it. Hold it, Joe, you've done your stint now relax. He's gone. No! I'm too old. Too old. I can't do anymore. You don't have to. I will. That's my father. Well? I got the report. I know, a drunk fell off a train. The way I got it, he was trying to save the life of some old man. How long have you been in the force, Sergeant? Twenty years. Why? There was no old man.
