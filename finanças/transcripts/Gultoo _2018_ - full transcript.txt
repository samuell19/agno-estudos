Sir, I?ve lost my phone. What?s the big deal about it? Sir, it?s not about the mobile. The data inside is more important. Data... What is that? Lift your head. Lift. Now. Speak up! Hit him! Hit him again Sir...! Why did you kill? Speak up! I didn?t kill him on purpose. The highest bid was for murder. So, I did it. Has he lost his mind? If you ask him about head, he talks about toe. I think he's a lunatic. Did the girl recognize him? Yes sir, she did. Why was there a delay in filing a complaint? I couldn?t step out of my home due to personal problems. He is already a short tempered guy, This will enrage him further. Sir! Let me know when Madam arrives. Get up! Move.. Sit down. He is not talking about it even after being tortured. I ran a background check. He has no big contacts He doesn?t have parents or relatives. All he has, is the one above us. Get him down. Sir, I swear that I have no connection to this. Sir! There are two things that happen while I interrogate One, you either confess to the crime irrespective of who has done it. Or, you will die before you agree to it. I swear I don?t know anything about this, sir! College life and the classroom, Will be your paradise. They made us believe this. Then, they pushed us down the drain. VTU We really love you, Don?t turn us into jilted lovers. Campus stories are blossoming, and smiles are introducing us to love. Memories of college are beautiful.. Semesters have started, and it?s driving us crazy. Seniors are a little intimidating and it?s all happening too fast. USN, is our name now, while attendance proxy is a habit. Hey! You idiot! Stand Up. Do you guys watch porn? I'm sure he watches them a lot, just look at all the acne on his face. You will have to enact your favorite scene from a porn movie. Get your hands off me! Sir, I won't do it. Why won't you do it? You have to do it. If you can't do it..... ..Then you will have to book 10 movie tickets for us tomorrow. He's come here on a scholarship, I don't think he will have money. I'm not forcing him. He can either act today, Or take us for a movie tomorrow. Okay!? Okay sir. Give me your laptop! Dude, he has booked the tickets. Morning Sir! Alok! Whole college has been talking about you. Did you hack the ticketing website and book movie tickets for seniors? Sir, I didn?t have money to buy tickets sir. What does your dad do? My parents are no more. I was raised in an orphanage Oh!.....I'm Sorry! College is the only place where your mistakes are forgiven It's a different world outside. You won?t get a lot of chances. If you?re looking at taking up a lucrative job offer, think again! Engineers in this city are already packed like sardines. Channelize your intelligence, Indian IT market is booming And, Bengaluru is the start up capital of India. But starting a start up is not easy. An idea that hasn?t been executed has to come to you And that will make you win. I?ll think about it sir. Okay...All the best! This is the guy who booked tickets for seniors, If I dated him, I would have watched a new movie everyday. Listen to what I say carefully, To survive in Bengaluru you need 3 things. Dressing sense, intelligence, and money. You are intelligent, and dressing sense would have been better, if you had money. Can we go do shopping together? Yes! CS, IS, EC... It?s time to send those friend requests to girls. Hello! Hi?s! How Are You?s As we slowly introduce ourselves. We have started liking, along with Whatsapp chatting, The Night?s without sleep, continues in classrooms C has become plus while fun is on minus M1 & M2 are an eternal knot How do we escape this Syllabus Noise, Classroom silence, and boys chaos? Bookworms of the first bench, The pranksters of the last bench, both are tensed. Mass bunk, Cinema, Long Drive and Attendance shortage, Amidst this even our friends get engaged. The projects still haunt us, and all we want is 15 and 35 plus. Java is killing our lives. Oh Java! Why don't you die too? Companies want campuses now, while we want GPA?s to be shown, We are Engineers We are India?s Future. We are Engineers India?s Future is still unknown. Alok, I have never wished for anything in life. Shivani, I?m not important enough for you to shed tears on me. We both belong to different worlds. I?m glad you liked me despite the differences. But, please understand, I?m in no position to decide our future. Alok! I?ll miss you. I never want to see you again. I have attended 3 interviews since morning. Couldn?t clear even a single interview. How did your interview go? I?m sure you must have done well. Wearing shoes is extremely irritating. I don?t think I'm attending any interviews. Why? Can?t see myself clearing interviews, wearing formals, working a 9-6 job, borrowing money to suffice expenses. Trying to please the manager, attending his parties and also ending up paying his bills.. ..Even after doing all this, at the end of the month, will still fall short of money. If I have to wear formals, then it will be for myself. I want to start a start up. Super Idea dude! Let?s work only for ourselves. When do we begin? Don?t act on impulse, think about it. I have decided, If I can become anything? I?d rather be Ambani himself. Give me a Hi-Five! Here's your coffee sir! There's free Wi-Fi! You can access it. Sir! Are you alright? Help me a little. I'll look for an auto outside. For how long have you used the system? About 30 minutes. Earlier credit is 50 Rs, Shall I take that too? Yes, sure! Hey Raki! Need you vehicle. I'm shifting my room. Thanks! Sir, we are near the colony. Come inside! Has somebody died here? No! It's just me composing tunes. Compose it after my death! Please come in. Please hold this! I own a flower business. Was preparing flowers for an order today. Room is upstairs. Come I'll show it to you. Come see! Rent should be paid on the 10th of every month without fail! Pay the electricity bill, when it arrives. Don't open this door, it leads to the godown. Here's the keys! Thank You! Everybody is posting about their new car, home, and bike on Facebook What about it? We set out to be Ambani's. We're now changing houses without paying rent. I still need time to prepare my business model Also, nobody becomes Ambani overnight! 3 years is not overnight! I don't know how much more should we wait. I've never forced you to stay with me! Stay if you want, or leave right now. Fighting with my buddy, feeling irritated, He doesn't understand my feelings. Excuse Me! Yesterday...My laptop.. Don't worry It's safe, How Are You? I'm okay. One minute! This is my office laptop! Thank you! Please keep this! Sorry, I don't accept free money. I'm Susheel. Alok! Nice meeting you, Thanks again. Come! Madam, Pooja, she's joined today! Hi! Hello! Welcome. Thank you! This is Vidya! Vidya, This is Pooja! Sir! This is Prakash. He is the senior most faculty! Hello Sir! Pooja, She's joined us today. We are sitting jobless here, What will you do after joining? We will chit-chat and pass time. 6 people work in this institute. 5 people including both of us. And.. Six people including Alok! Alok, Pooja. She's joined us today! Hi! He's talented and a very nice guy. Zero bad habits, and very hard working! He works with us full-time. And works part-time at coffee day. There's something charming about him! Why don't you tell him that you love him? I was behind him for 6 months. And requested him so much! Then what happened? He didn't budge at all. As a last resort, I gave him an inviting offer, And asked if he's willing go on an outing. Did he agree to it? No! he didn't. After this, I decided to give up on him. So that's how your love story ended? There was no love, Just attraction, maybe. Can we use the computer? Why do you want to use it? We have school project to complete. Do you also have project work? Yes! Please don't do anything brother! Don't be scared. I won't hit you, come. What are you doing? Stand here, Don't pull my shorts, it's loose. I know why you wear shorts like these. 17', 18', You come here. 17'5. Now go inside. Will measure when you step out. If the shorts has moved an inch, then I'll thrash you both. Don't you trust us? You should have self-control in life. There's nobody at home. Are you busy? I'm so happy! Aye! Enter details before going. Such a melodious music! Uffff! My excitement has hit the roof! Kavya! How are you! It's been so long since I met you. I am fine! You should have told that you're coming. Aren't you scared to stay alone? How much time does it take to open a door? How much time does.....! Whom do you want? Who's that? Whom do you want? Isn't this G-12? No, this is G-11. Who was that? Don't you really know him? Sir! I had really come to G-12. But, this is G-11. Sorry! Encryption. Decryption. Encoding an information with a key, And passing it across is encryption. On the other side, if they know the key, They can decode, and obtain the information. Didn't you guys understand? No! A has gold which he has to give C but, B shouldn't know that there's gold. So A adds plus 2 to each letter and passes it. This is encryption. Plus 2 is the key. Now, B doesn't realize that it's gold. C will obtain the gold by subtracting 2. This process is called decryption. I told my parents that I'll take up commerce and not science. Please let me go ma'am. Sit down! Instead of just laughing. Can't you come and help? It's my first class. Please! I'll come. As children, Me and mybr/friend spoke in Pa & Ta Language. Nobody understood the language except us. Even we have used it! Really? Nice! How do you ask if somebody had lunch in Pa Language? Ha-Pa-D Lu-Pa-nch (Had Lunch) Here, Had Lunch is your information. Ha-Pa-D Lu-Pa-nch is your encrypted code. Pa is the key used to encrypt and decrypt. That's encryption and decryption for you! Now we understood everything, sir! It was tough for me to explain. You made it look simple, thanks a lot. This is my favourite subject. I have done a lot of projects on it. Sorry! Grandparents came unexpectedly. Couldn't text you after that. Are you angry? No! Then what is my prince doing? There are no wars to fight, So he is resting now. Tomorrow, everybody in the family is leaving this princess behind and are stepping out of the kingdom. Really? Yes. Then your kingdom Will be our hunting ground. You must fill an entry form every time you visit. You didn't do it last time. My manager scoffs at me later. He acts like this is a software company. I'm done entering, can I go now? One Minute! Is your name Asthi? It's Aasthi and Asthi. What's the purpose of this visit? Kavya, wait! Don't run. Stop. Not bad, the king does hunt well! When the security asked for purpose of Visit. I went completely blank. You should have told him 'I've come to talk with the girl I am getting married to' The mention of marriage makes my temperature soar. You said there's wine at home, right? Go bring it. Choose between us, Me or the wine? Me or the wine? Hi! How are you? Fine! How are you? Good! I've got to check on the cooking stove. Bye! Majnoo misses you. Laila misses you too. Now leave! Bye! Alok! I want to take you out for a coffee. For helping me with the class. Please come. Pooja! I'm a little busy. You Carry on. Okay! Is playing a game more important than having coffee with me? This is too much. Okay! Let's go. What do you have? Idli, poori, kesari baath, Khaara baath, bisi bele baath, and rice bath. How much does one plate Idli cost? 20rs. How about single vada? That is 20 rs too. How about rice bath? 25 rs. Okay! Go get me a cup of coffee. Just to buy a coffee, He's enquiring about the entire world. What do you want? One Coffee please. Two Coffees to this table. One Idli Vada to that table. I'll pay the money for it. Make sure you don't let him know. Do you know the old man? No, I don't. Then why did you order for him? When you're hungry you shouldn't bother about money. Are you saying he doesn't have money? Did you see how arrogant he was? My guess is that he's extremely hungry. When you're hungry, you tend to be more angry. Here's your coffee. Coffee! I had just ordered for a coffee! Today if you buy coffee, We give a plate of free idli Vada. Enjoy! Alok! Don't you have a girlfriend? No! Why? I just asked! Nobody asks for vacancy, If they have no intention of applying. My intention was not to apply, but curiousity.. if you take care of the needs of a stranger, So well. How well should you understand your girlfriends needs. No girl will agree to be with me, Just because we show concern and care for them. If you search at the right place. You will get a perfect girl. I can see only old people here. Are they only old people here? Huh? Hi! I am Aasthi! And you are? How did you get this? I've become close to the owner. He said take it whenever you want. The rent can be paid later too. This is my friend Arasaiah Thimmapa! Excuse me! It's Aasthi. Just Aasthi! I am Pooja! Hi! What's your full name? It's Pooja Ramesh. Nice Meeting You. Nice meeting you too, Pooja. Okay let's leave. Bye! Shall we leave? Yes! It doesn't look like there's a forced entry anywhere. I think the murderer knew this person well. One wine glass is missing from the set. A lot of evidences are gradually surfacing. I had heard about laughter being the best medicine, Never believed in it. After seeing you laugh, I believe it. Whoa! Somebody is learning how to flirt. It's not flirting, it's just the truth. What made you laugh so much today? Aasthi had sent a funny video on facebook. How is Aasthi your friend? When did he become your friend? Remember he asked for my full name, He sent a friend request the same day. Did you accept just because he sent it. Yes. If he's your friend, then he's my friend too. Do you feel I shouldn't have accepted it? Don't laugh for everything, people will think you're mad. I don't understand, what goes on in your mind when you laugh. Someone was calling laughter as the best medicine. Looks like the medicine isn't working now. He's a big flirt, His head is filled with thoughts related to girls. Really? He changes girlfriends like Whatsapp DPs. So Often! That's very bad. From tomorrow he will kill you with candy crush invites. I hate candy crush. I should have never accepted his friend request at all. Exactly! Exactly? Exactly! But, I think it's okay, My friend list is filled with flirts anyway. He will become an addition to it, I'll manage him with the others. Good! Very Good! Please carry on. You know what? No! There's nobody like you in my friend list. What does that mean? Somebody who's caring, possesive, protective. I'm neither hitting on you nor being possessive. advising you like a friend..No! like a brother... Shhhhh! Stop it. Pooja you haven't heard anything. Relax. Just Relax. Breathe out! It's okay. How could you think I'm like your sister? Do you see any flaws in me? Yeah right! Keep laughing, laughter is the best medicine after all. Together, waves wave their hands as the shore nods in agreement.. ..You are the music to my breath and words to my heart.. The girl with less sister characteristics and more of a girlfriend. Coffee? Tomorrow? ..and every tune is slowly making me feel euphoric.. ..I will become your shadow even when it's dark.. ..Will walk with you, while you walk towards me.. I will reach your heart, and will rest on your lap.. ..I don?t need anything else.. ..This feeling is new to me Give something new to me.. ..A new world may be.. ..Pester me for the secret I haven?t revealed.. ..With words so soothing, that my senses calm down.. ..I will be your shadow?s shadow as I walk together.. ..And wait for you while you come towards me.. ..This feeling is new to me Give something new to me.. ..A new world may be.. ..The love that you haven?t seen Will be gifted to you.. ..For, just dreams, I will not promise.. The words hidden in my heart Can I accept them like a sweet defeat? Smitha! let it through! Come! Come! Hi! this is Aasthi! Alok's friend. Hi! Smitha. Okay! let's go! It's already too late. Bye! Okay bye! Should we really have to go? Tomorrow what time will you meet? It depends on what time you let me go today. You've never seen me wearing a saree no? No! I've never seen you while wearing a saree. I'll wear a saree tomorrow, If you promise to come soon. Okay? Bye! Bye! What's your favorite color? Pink Color. He was wearing Pink color shirt sir! My brother is mentally ill. He may appear nomal, but at times he is out of control. ACP had asked to take a look at the boy. Did nobody come near the apartment, from 11am till 2 pm? The lady in the apartment is not a respectable woman None of us knew about him visiting her often. Nobody else came. Only him. He came twice in this week. The first time he came, he left in 5 minutes. The second time he came.. She must have trapped him after knowing he's rich. Stand outside! I'll call you again! Money is not of importance, Avinash. Our family has a reputation in this society. This case is very embarrassing Everything has a price in this world, Avinash. I'm writing yours in bold. Get up your Bast**d! During the murder, apart from Aasthi, nobody else has entered the house. The numbers written in the register, are switched off. The guy in the lock up, isn't responding at all. You leave! I'll come and look into it. Summon Aasthi to police station, and then file a FIR against him. Everything has a price, agreed. but not everybody can afford to buy everything. This is the price of my mercy on you. Your work will be done. You can leave. Hi! Good Morning! Has Alok come to work? Not Yet! Good Morning Madam! Smitha, is this looking good? He will come and tell you! ..As the cloud sways with winds, every droplet turns into a pearl.. ..The bud turns into a flower, and waits to turn into a bee's adulation.. Beyond the ocean, Beyond my emotions, ..Like a dream turning into reality. Did it rain? Did the drops turn into pearl? Beyond the ocean, Beyond my emotions, ..Like a dream turning into reality. Did it rain? Did the drops turn into pearl? ..Waiting for you at dusk, as love turns into a pearl.. ..And it drifts into a silence.. Done shopping? Yes! What did you buy? Excuse Me! Does Aasthi live here? He stays in third floor! Could you guide them to his house? Okay come! Go and bring him, if he's there. Ok Sir! Four Dresses! Four? What all? 2 Shirts and 2 pants. Your clothes must be so lucky. Why will they be lucky? It gets to hug you an entire day. Nobody is opening the door. There's nothing I can do about that. Naughty guy! Were you inside the room all this while? Can't you knock the door once? What were you upto inside the room? I've called you around 30 times. Your phone was switched off. I was completing projects. Didn't realize that phone was off. Oh! Okay! Go near the institute once. Pooja is apparently waiting for you. How do you know about her waiting? I was chatting with Smitha, She told me about it. Smitha? When did this begin? Can't you keep your hands and mouth to yourself? A good manager will never keep his resource idle. Smitha! Where's Pooja? She was waiting since morning, and left sometime back. Let her be today, She will be angry. You can console her tomorrow. Bye Sir! Was she wearing a saree? How was she looking? It will look good only to the person she wore it for.. Good Morning! Morning! Hi! Good Morning! I thought you'd be angry. Why should I be angry? That I couldn't meet you yesterday! You will have your own priorities, Alok. You must have worked on the project the entire night Your phone must have died without charge. I can wear saree anytime. I should understand that your priorities are different. Why are you segregating things between us? What's your system password? The moment you give your password to a new girl She will know the name of the old one. So, there are secrets between us. And that means we both have different lives too. You are right about why I didn't meet you yesterday. I'm Really Sorry! I don't like people who lie. I'm not lying, Pooja! The time alone, That I spent, ..Like I always wished to spend.. ..The things you always wished for.. ..I?ve always waited for you to say.. In my own way.. ..Please find the heart to forgive my heart.. ..Will wait for it till eternity.. ..I hope you find the heart, I hope it rains forgiveness.. ..In the clear blue sky, I hope the drops turn into pearls.. ..Beyond the ocean, Beyond my emotions.. ..Like a dream turning into reality Did it rain? .. ..Did the drops turn into pearl? ..Beyond the ocean, Beyond my emotions.. ..Like a dream turning into reality Did it rain? .. Did the drops turn into pearl? Done freshening up. Which soap do you use? Mysore Sandal Soap. Your soap must be so lucky. Getting ready to sleep now. Your bed must be so lucky. I can't sleep without a blanket. Oh God! Even the blanket is so lucky! I wish you could make me lucky too. How? By sending your picture. Do we need secrets between us? Send a picture that doesn't hide anything. You send it first. Hahaahaha.. Little Popeye! Alok! I'm missing you a lot! I'm dying to see you in a saree, Pooja! I want to spend time with you! Can we go to your room? I've got a surprise for you! Who's this girl? She's my friend! If she's a friend, then it's okay. Guys before you used to introduce girls as their sisters! This is my room! Finally.. I get to step in. Saree... For you! Saree? How can I drape it here? This goes to owner's godown. There won't be anybody there. You can change here! Hold this bag. You?re a miracle.. How do I believe it without getting close? The desire to get close has increased with time. Mesmerizing beauty, unfolds in front of my eyes. My Quivering lip has a lot to say. I?m slowly losing myself, even breathing has turned into music. My heart is getting restless, to fulfill its desires. If you draw me so close to you. How do I survive? Should we still hide from the world, Till you see the other side of me. Need a magical touch to free me of this curse.. The flame in your eyes, has started a wildfire in me. As we spend time together, each moment is colorful. Heart is a garden now, and so begins my search for the treasure. Tell your password! Will change it from old girlfriend's name to my name. Love You Anu! Aasthi?! Aasthi!! Hey Manasa! How do I get out of this? Hi! How come you're here? How have you been? I'm awesome! How about you? I'm good too! What are you upto these days? This is my son. He's Cute. After marriage I shifted to the US, came here for vacations. Will fly back by the end of this month. How about you? My company is almost ready, Once investors are on-board, There's no looking back. Why did we even break up, Aasthi? You never trusted me, were always dominating. It's impossible to handle a relationship like that. I thought I deserved a better girl! It's not about a better girl. You can never take care of any girl. Smooth talk is good during college days. When it comes to marriage, you always run away. I thought you're responsible now. But you're dependent on Alok even now. As a friend, Here's something I can tell, Only you can take control of your life. Good Bye! Bye! Bye! Pooja! When are we meeting again? We've started it today! Will keep meeting more often. Can't I take my own decisions?! Choosing not to marry you, Was also my own decision. You left me for a guy from US. How much did you drink? Why are you talking so loudly? Alok, I am completely dependent on you, it seems. Infact, I'm nothing without it you. Is this true? It might be true, Without you, I can't even get inside our room. Yes, You can't go inside. Because I have the room key. Get up! We can't go without keys, Come sit. I Met Manasa today. You can't take care of girl. Infact, you can't even take an own decision. She said your existence is a waste. Mine? Not you. She told it to me. She chided me a lot and left. Alok! Alok!! Is it true? Am I good for nothing? Aasthi! Life gives everybody an opportunity To prove themselves. Till that happens and we prove ourselves, We are all good for nothing. Oh Sorry Manasa! You were right, Manasa! I am good for nothing! I loved her for 2 years. She left me, when I had nothing left with me. I am with you since 7 years. Why haven't you left me yet? Like how lovers have this thing called break up. There's nothing of that sort for friends. That's why. That's enough philosophy for the day. Let's go now. I love you so much! You've been handling me, A good for nothing fellow since 8 years. You could have gotten married by now, And could have even flown to the US. But you did not do anything like that. You've always let me be with you, In all your highs and lows. Give me a minute! I may be drunk... But listen to what I say.. Friendship is always greater than love.. The house looks so clean! *Pukes* I will never drink ever again. You even clean me up, You're really great, Alok! True friendship is..... Shut up and sleep. Whom do you want? Sir! Hello! Sir!! Sir, He's not well.. Wake up! Sir, he's completely drunk. Put some clothes and get him. Wake him up now! I want to pee! I'll make you pee in station. The only crime we've done is stealing a girls heart. Please tell why have you arrested us!? Officer will come and explain, wait. Good Morning Madam! All of you wait here! You have hacked confidential information from Government data center. It's good if you confess to your crimes, and return the files. Or, I'll have to proceed with interrogation. I haven't stolen any files. Anagha! Chief wants to see you. Be a little harsh on him, Let me know when he confesses. I think you need look into this sir! There's been a lot of network usage, Since the last three days. Somebody has broken into our security. What? We have lost too much data! My God! Inform cyber intelligence immediately! Top Priority Case! Data center has been hacked. One clue has been pointing towards a training institute in Bangalore. Anagha! Leave immediately! Ok Sir! What's your system password? We've started it today! Will keep meeting more often. Hi! This is Phaneesh from SBB Team. Yes, the development is in progress. DB team is working on the ticket. Once solved, we shall proceed. Thank You! You Too. No Parking! The fine is 750 rupees Why should I pay 700rs fine for no parking?! Hey you, bring your DL! If you got to court it will be 750rs Just pay 500rs here, and leave. I was getting a call, so had to stop my vehicle on the side. Ya! But that was a no parking zone. Pay 750 rupees or just give 300 rupees and leave. Why should I pay fine? If you got to court you will have to pay 750 rupees. Okay, Just pay 200 rupees here. Please try and understand my point! If you can't even pay 200 rupees, Why should I listen to you? You should have thought about this before breaking the rules. Sir, I follow rules very strictly I haven't even taken a wrong U-Turn ever. I'll pay the fine, here take this. Okay Give! Give me the receipt. You write the acknowledgement, I'll pay. I'm writing it, you pay it first. Why do you look so angry, Phaneesh? Try paying 750 rupees fine early morning. You will know. Even a no parking board wasn't placed there. Honest people are not valued at all. IT employees can never make The kind of money police and thieves make. I'm planning to pull off a crime, and settle down peacefully. You could join me if you want. Sir! A policeman is looking for you. I haven't even planned yet, Are they here already? Phaneesh!? Hello! Hi! Anagha! Cyber lntelligence Bureau I don't know why I have been summoned here. Were you suspended from college, for leaking principal's private pictures online? I had a problem with my Head of Department I didn't know that HOD had an affair with principal. You have taken money from Ling Basaiah Nandimutt's bank account and transferred it to yours. There's no case against you, Because he hasn't filed a complaint. Taking money from your dad's purse is not a crime. Ling Basaiah is my father, hence he didn't press charges. But, he pressed me well at home. IRCTC? There was a bug in their algorithm lnfact they didn't know that their website was hacked until I told them about it. I'm not doing all this now. I'm a changed man. Why am I being arrested now? You are not being arrested. We are investigating a case.. ...Need your help on that. Never knew the mistakes I did, would turn out to be my qualification. Sorry! Come! Sorry! I have an appointment to meet the Chief Minister. Are you Ms.Anagha? Yes! Delhi Intelligence has ordered the local police force to support you. But I can't do it without details. I don't have time, make it quick. Sure Sir! I'll quickly run you through the case. In 2009, Indian Government, Collected the names, addresses, photographs.. ?Fingerprints of all the fingers, Iris from the eye, from all its citizens... To give everybody an unique identity through the SUDHAR program The main intention was to quash fake IDs And also,.. I know what SUDHAR is, please proceed. Everybody knows about it. I'm sure you know. Just telling it, so you don't find it difficult to analyze the damage and losses from this case. Loss? Analyze? What do you mean? I shall explain! We collect all the details needed to identify a person, and keep them in a file. The file is given a number, And it's called the SUDHAR number. As on July 2016, we have issued, over 100 crore SUDHAR numbers. When compared to other countries, We rank highest in terms of issuing this unique identity. Unfortunately, all the files have been stolen. What? Are you serious? This is the biggest data theft in the world. Sir! It's time for the meeting with ministers Cancel that meeting, Don't let anybody come inside. Leave! Do you know the money government has spent to collect details from everybody? What do you mean by its stolen? When I say it's stolen, it's not like we don't have those files with us. Then? Data theft means.. These files are called Data. It is stored in a computer just like in a rack like this. The hacker has taken a copy of all the files and has stored it somewhere. Now, since both the informations are same ...We can't differentiate between original and duplicate. The information in your hand, and the one in the rack are the same. How could they steal it from such a secured infrastructure? They don't have to physically go and steal it. They can sit in a room and still steal data. The room could be in a different city, or even a different country. How will people believe that somebody from somewhere has stolen their identity? These days, we book food and movies online, Our money transactions are also online. We book cinema tickets online When our life is on internet. It's not surprising that crime has moved to internet too. What's the risk if he has the information? How's it a problem? We are at a 95% risk. Global economy is 95% online now. After demonetization, it will move to a 100% On the internet, we are not people. We are just information Let's take my example, my name, age, my email id, which school did I go to... ...Which college did I go to, Where do I work.. Where is my home? What is my vehicle number? Am I a vegetarian? Am I a meat eater?.. How much do I earn? How much loan have I taken? My shirt size, my pant size, Including my boxers' size. Every tiny detail sits in a file, inside an online profile. Not just mine, all of ours. If a team is interested in collecting it, there's a team that is interested in buying it. In technical terms, it is called THE BIG DATA. Flipkart and Amazon, these companies, use this information and do business. Collecting and selling of this information is completely legal. But,with SUDHAR, Government, to transfer benefits has linked bank accounts with the SUDHAR Number And this is complicated! Imagine a thief has all these details, and starts stealing just 1 rupee from all the accounts. We are a population of 100 crores. A lot of people have saved their black money elsewhere. And, for accounts like these, fingerprints act as passwords. What if the thief targets the black money holders? Nobody will complain if a rupee is lost. It's the same with black money holders. Information is money, it can be stolen, and once stolen, it can be sold too. There's a huge market for this on the internet. What kind of market is this? This is a very weird market, Somebody toils, and somebody else reaps benefits. Our job is to just transport things. His shaving, her waxing. Dad pays electricity bill, mom buys vegetables. Grandfather departing on his final journey. Grandmother getting admitted in a hospital. Husband shifts to Dubai, While wife sits in Mangalore. They were brought closer by a small 24 Megapixel web camera. Every bit of their information online, Brings in money to us. Try extracting information directly or indirectly, if it doesn't happen, steal. Yes Boss! You can't hide anything from us, we are always watching you. Massager for Back Pain!

Listen carefully! It's difficult to catch something that is seen. This is a lost case. We both sell the same product, Yet, people buy it from only him? Business is not like selling peanuts. You should have data. What is data? You won't understand if I tell you. Wait! I'll bring you proper data. Wait! I'll pay how much ever you want. Will you take me with you? I don't want money. Will you give your data? Okay! I'll give. Come. 'Information!' 'information!' 'Data!' This is deep web. The data we obtain is sold, bought, and exchanged here. We can get fake passport, visa, driving license, of any country here, and it's as good as original. All kinds of weapons are available here. You can buy it like you're ordering shorts online. You could get people killed, nobody will know who did it. Getting high is just a click away. All the pictures you send, lies naked in front of us. I cannot let you go beyond this let this one thing go. What's happening inside? Listen to me, let this go. I want to see what's happening. Not here, come with me. Red room, this is where biddings happen. These are a bunch of psychos. This is human experimenting room. One person kidnaps people and bring them here. These people bid to cut the person's hands, limbs, or wrists. He executes whatever the highest bidding is for. They watch it live and enjoy it. Another video is streaming live now. Head! Head! Head! Head! Head! We are all good by birth, This system slowly corrupts our ethics. In my 15 years of administration, Nobody has ever been cheated. It's okay if politicians lose crores of rupees, But a normal person shouldn't lose a single rupee. Use the entire police force if needed Get the data back at any cost. Sure Sir! We have zeroed in on a suspect already. Hit him more! Again. Sir! Why did you murder her? Talk! I didn't do it on purpose, Highest bidding was for murder. That's why I killed her. It's been days since the murder. Why didn't you file a complaint? I couldn't step out due to personal problems. In Visitor's list, apart from Aasthi, nobody else has entered their names. How can you be so sure that you saw this person on the day of murder? - I have seen him visiting the neighboring flat, - a lot of times. I saw him on the day of murder too. Moreover, Aasthi came to my house. What is your relationship with Aasthi? We both like eachother. What is he doing now? I don't know sir. I met him last on that day. His phone is switched off from that day. Sir! Our inspector is searching for the other boy right? When has he ever caught the right person? Let us start! The first clue about the large data movement pointed towards a training centre in Bangalore. Data center was attacked by a virus on August 3rd From an employee's laptop. This employee faints in a coffee shop while drinking coffee on August 2nd. Somebody takes him to the hospital But, his laptop remains there. He gets his laptop the next day. When you connect these dots, All fingers point towards Alok. That's it. He must have mixed sedatives in coffee, and then injected virus in the laptop When the employee connected his laptop to the data center, the virus was triggered. What if the employee has generated this virus? The technical expertise of him and the way.. This virus has been designed doesn't match. However, we are interrogating him. So you're suspecting only Alok. Any supporting evidences? There's no evidence. But once I had fooled him, and had taken his password. I searched and found a few potential clues. That's all! Stolen data is usually saved in physical mediums. Like DVD, Hard drive, CDs. We've searched his room, workplace, Coffee shop, training institute, everywhere.. There was nothing. Then digital mediums, like cloud, drives.. And email. I'll start looking at these things. Right! Rest of the information is in these files. Thank You! When I started working, her parents.. Had not started working too... And She makes me stand outside the door like a dog. Everything has a price. Nobody will steal something that is worthless. You must have stolen something extremely valuable, or she wouldn't have landed here from Delhi. Tell.. What did you steal? Avinash! Stop it now. Avinash I said enough. Sorry Madam! I couldn't hear. He's still saying he hasn't stolen anything. Atleast you made him say that. Great! Now wait outside. I'm sorry to see you like this. But you're the reason for your situation. The sooner you surrender the data, The better it is for you. Alok! I don't have any data. A lot of reasons are forcing me not to believe it, Alok! The virus infected laptop .. Was with you, the previous day.. And we have the CCTV footage to prove it.. No matter how you see this case, You're right at the very center of it. You have very minimal choices. One, you either confess to the crime, Or, you die here. A few co-incidences.. Will not make me a criminal. And, Without any evidence, You can't keep me in custody.. For long.. Who said that this is police custody? Nobody knows that you're in an interrogation. And, I know that nobody will come looking for you. Police records will have you as a missing person. We search for people who are missing, not people who are lost. You always had the choice of a decent life. You could have done anything. Why did you do this to yourself? Who wants to know it? Pooja... or Anagha? Whatever was done as Pooja is a lie, If you believe anything in that is true.. Then it's just your imagination. My parents passed away when I was a kid. I grew up in an ashram. I used to study really well. Mathematics was my favorite subject. I came to Bangalore for engineering. I used to be one among the crowd in my village. But here, everybody wore nice clothes, Sneakers. They would frequent multiplexes when bored... Play a game of bowling, and visit new restaurant every day. They change phones because they're bored, and bikes because the color has begun to fade. In my eyes, their life was a celebration. But I lead a calculated life. Never had the courage to look at a menu, and order food, even if it meant starving. Clothes and shoes were never in my budget. If I came back from a hospital, the joy of getting well.. Was clouded by the fear of overshooting expenses. At first, none of these mattered. But slowly insecurity engulfed me. That's when Shivani entered my life. Her father was a rich businessman. She was the only daughter. And for some reason she liked me a lot. She used to take me with her always, bought nice clothes, dined at expensive places. The celebration I saw from a distance now became a part of my life. Till she was there, there were no worries. Once she left, it would be the same old life. Shivani was not a luxury, Shivani was peace of mind. That's the difference between mine and their life. They always have a choice between things. But in my case, I didn't have choice I had to make do with what I had. Even though I worked harder than all of them, I still had no choice That's why I wanted to bring my life to a stage, Where I get to choose things, and did just that. Between right and wrong, you can choose wrong.. If the righteous aren't harmed. And I chose it. You didn't arrest me, Anagha! It was my choice to come here. I will choose the duration of my stay too. What do you mean? I mean, the fact that I'm the thief, is just your imagination, Anagha. To prove me as the thief You need the data, before I leave. There was no connection between my college degree and the job I went to after college. I made a plan to reach a place in 3 years, which would otherwise take 15 years to reach. The shortcut to success needed a key, I found the key, and even said hello to it. I joined the coffee shop he went to regularly. Step 1 - Shoulder Surfing I had to find out his login and system passwords. Tables on this side are reserved, If you don't mind, can you sit on the last table? Okay, Sure! Thank You! I got all the passwords, to enter data center's network. Step 2 - I had to get his laptop Step 3 Injecting the worm. Excuse me, My laptop was here yesterday Don't worry, I've kept it safe. It was perfect till here, Then you came into my life. If you can guess my date of birth, I'll give you a surprise. Thanks for asking that question. Pooja, the love of my life. Her real name was Anagha. When everything was going smooth, Police started tracking me. What are you doing here? Come to the police station. Why Sir? There are 3 new cases, one of them has to be yours. There was no point running away. There's a surprise for you in the room. Love you Anu! I thought I'll stay, right in front of you all. And even if you realize that I'm the thief... They should be helpless to do anything. Let the fun begin. How did he find out that I am a police? Phaneesh! If you were the criminal, where would you hide the data? I would never keep it in my personal computer. Physical hard drive? No way. Workplace. . Definitely not. Friend, I would probably keep it with a friend. Yes, a friend of his worked at an internet cafe. You should check it out. Yes!... Ramesh!? Ramesh! Go to the internet cafe, seize all the computers and bring them. Ok Madam! Anagha, there's one more place we should check. Where? Come. Hey! She's a police. Police? Run, run. Will you arrest god now? Have any important CDs arrived? In the last 2 months? or 2 weeks ago? Foreign or Indian? Not that, the one with important information. I have run the data sniffer program, and web crawler bots. In case there's any data resemblance, We will get immediate information. I'm trying. From August 4th till the day he got arrested. Check his phone network. Go to each internet cafe in all areas,his phone network shows, and check if he has logged in. He must have given his ID proof, you'll easily know. I want all the systems that he has used. Seize everything and get it to the station. Move, don't leave things, get everything and come. Sir please sir, what are you doing sir? Bro! Police have come. Sir, that's a TV. They've taken away all our PCs. Come soon. Any leads? No. Apart from a few movies on torrents, he hasn't uploaded anything else. Anagha, is there a movie called, Dawn of the bedsheets? I don't watch Kannada movies. Tomato Pushpa, seed in the morning, ripe at night. This is why I don't watch Kannada movies. It's okay if you don't watch any movies. There's this movie called Gultoo, you should watch it. What? Come soon. Your photos, videos, voice notes... He's mashed everything into a video, and uploaded it on torrents. But why should one upload this to torrents? I have no idea. 'Sir'! Yes tell me Ramesh! Sir, we have brought the computers. Yes, get it inside. If we get it here, the entire office will be full. What are you saying Ramesh? Come show it to me. Oh God! So many computers? Yes Sir! For his peace of mind, he's spoiling our peace of mind. Avinash! Avinash! Why do you always wait outside like a dog? Sit down I need to talk to you. If there's a price for everything, Then you must have a price too. I'll pay you the kind of money that you have never seen in your life. If you do what I say. What should I do? CH100-00-2300-A10 Tell this number to the person I tell you. What should I do after that? You don't have to do anything after that, they will come running towards me. How do you know the account number? It's okay if I just knew about the account. But I know that it has two thousand crores. Who are you? The cleanest politician in state, has hidden away, 2000 crores with him. Leave that, Come to the topic. Tell what do you want? A few years ago, An Italian, stole client details of.. Over a lakh and a half people from the Swiss bank. 4000 accounts belonged to Indians. He wanted finger prints of these people. Yours included. I don't know what his profit in it is. But he offered me an exorbitant sum for these finger prints. If you want your fingerprints to not reach him, then you have to save me from this case. I have worn khadi to hide the blood on my hands. I haven't started politics now... Politics has always been in my blood. I've tamed many people like you, and ruled the state for 15 years. Nobody has a whiff of the things I've done. You're trying to threaten me in my zone, especially when you're in my police custody. I've made you come all the way, While I sat in your police custody, Sir! A bait attracts both, a small fish and a shark, People on the shore will never know what it is. If I kill you here, Then our police, and the Italian guy will never get any fingerprints. Sir, Sir! Your government will collapse, even if you kill me here today. Tomorrow midnight all the 20 videos.. I've recorded, will go live on youtube. Media and press will receive a mail. That has all your black money and transaction details. I came to the custody after everything was planned. You don't have much time. If I don't get out by tomorrow... Your government will definitely collapse. You said he was being interrogated secretly. How will you produce him to court? How will you produce him before court? I'll do something! I'll do it. Take this, it has to become big news tomorrow. So big, that it has to reach Delhi. Okay Sir! Front page is already being printed. It will cost you a lot. How can I say no to you, madam! I will get it done. Hello! Coming sir! Where you are going? Baby, give me 15 minutes. I'll come back soon. Government informer is saying that SUDHAR card details have been stolen. This will be the top news. Now everybody is screwed. Mandatorily Come let's update it right away. Stop the printing now! We'll have to change the headlines. Dude I'll give you some awesome scoop, to make memes. A cyber crime that has shocked the country, was committed in Namma Bengaluru. Over 80 crore SUDHAR numbers have been leaked. Oh My God! This is killer news. Internet is not just entertainment. It is a gold mine of information. If you don't listen to what I say, Then I'll thrash you badly. What are you doing? Sir, Facebook live. Whatever it is that you're doing, Go home and do it. Bofors scam, 2G scam, had already rocked our worlds, Now they've reached for our fingerprints too. Guys comment now. Every word you write has a price, Here keep this. I don't write false news. If it is the truth, then I don't need money to write it. You can leave now. Central Government opposed Supreme Court decision to enable SUDHAR, now stands embarrassed. *Breaking News Montage* Do you have any idea of the seriousness of this issue? Sir! I don't know how media picked this up. I'm really sorry, Just stop it Anagha! If I go down, I promise to take everyone down with me. Sir! You made a circus out of a small case. Sorry Sir! Useless fellow. Leave. Call Ananth. Hello! Namaste! One minute. Yes sir! It's better if we don't accept this, Yes. Supreme Court is already tailing us closely. Don't worry, I'll handle things here. Yes! Thank you! There is no evidence against accused, Hence the court orders to release them. Our heart wishes for a lot of things, as we grow, we are so engrossed in life... There's no place for these wishes. Anagha! In all these days, Didn't you love me at least once? I will never love a criminal. Your court has decided that I am innocent. The court may have said it, but that doesn't prove that you're not a criminal. Isn't it? We both know the truth. All your sincerity has given you nothing but loss. Aasthi! Life is not fair to everyone, Anagha! So.. It's not necessary that you should be fair to life too. Giving those wishes a place in our heart, and chasing them.. ...is a choice we always have. Aasthi! Don't touch me. There are wounds everywhere. I'm done. Aasthi! These wounds tell where we came from not where we are going next. One crore for this, one crore for that.. Altogether, a 100 crores. 100 crores? Yes! Really? Yesterday we were almost killed. Today, you're talking about 100 crores I don't know if you're a hero or villain. Come! I am not a hero to anybody. I thought it's okay to commit a crime. If a right man doesn't lose anything. I did it too. SUDHAR policy has helped a lot of poor people. Their money is going straight into their accounts. The security of such policy is being monitored with utmost importance. So... Our fingerprints are all safe with us. Don't worry about it. Don't worry. Hey Man! Did you get the stuff I asked you for? Yes. It's safe. Don't worry. Where is it? Send me the money you promised. I will. No problem. But, what about the cops? My startup needs an investor. Do the honours.. And, I'll tell you where the data is.. Anything for the data. Anything. Tell me how can I get my hands on it. Look for Gultoo Kannada movie on torrents. This is not something to be happy about. But, we have found the data finally. In that GULTOO video, He had hidden the data, and encrypted it. All these are Steganograph media. It's difficult to decrypt without the key But Phaneesh! Isn't this enough to file charges against him? But, that the file has been uploaded on torrents.. Is from your E-mail ID! It's a crime that hasn't hurt the righteous. I'm not a hero for anybody. I'm a hero for myself. I'm an accused not a convict. I'll definitely come back. Before you decide if I'm a good person or not, I'll be done running. Now.. The time to chase dreams is now yours. Chase your dreams. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
