This is the police. Help! Help, please! MADRID JUNE 15TH, 1991 01:35 A.M. It's okay. Please, calm down so I can understand you. - What happened? - Please, you have to come! He's inside! He's inside! Please, calm down. Tell me what you're seeing. Is there someone in your house? Hello! Detective! That's the building there, 3C. He's here. Mom! Mom! Detective! We're going to send someone right away. I need your address. 8 Gerardo Núñez Street. Are you still there? Hello? Calling all units, we have a 402 at 8 Gerardo Núñez Street. Any available cars please respond. I repeat, 8 Gerardo Núñez Street. EARLY MORNING, JUNE 15TH, 1991, MADRID POLICE STATION 02-12 RECEIVED AN EMERGENCY PHONE CALL. THIS STORY IS BASED ON THE POLICE REPORT... ...FILED BY THE DETECTIVE IN CHARGE OF THE CASE. It's confirmed. There are four kids, two more are upstairs. THREE DAYS EARLIER THURSDAY, JUNE 12TH, 1991 Irene, you get the bathroom first. Lucia, let's go! Get up. Don't make any noise. Come on, buddy, get up. Let's go to school. I want to go to school. You want to go to school? Great. - You wet the bed again?! - Yeah. Come here. Tell Irene to clean you up in the bathroom. Vero! - What's wrong? - Irene won't let me in. - I'm taking a shower! - Stop yelling! He peed himself again. Clean him up, you're older than him. Fine. I heard you. I'm older, I came out first. - Did you heat the milk? - No. Quite the older sister you are. Lucia! Pay attention, please! The teacher said to bring pictures to look at the eclipse. - Pictures? - Yeah. Your turn. Not pictures. Negatives, to shield our eyes. Gross! The towel smells like chicken. You smell like wet chicken. - Stop it! Vero! - Lucia, leave Irene alone. Take one of the towels hanging outside. Your shoes are untied. You could have told me about the pictures last night. - Me, me, me. - Fine, you do it. - Everything OK? - Yeah. We had a birthday party and closed at 2 AM last night. I'm exhausted. I came to get a picture for a class project. You rest. I'm going to sleep some more. I'll see you later. I heard it was night. It's all magic. And a spirit invited you to dream. I know that lately, I've barely stopped. I feel like I'm rambling... Dawn breaks so early, and I'm so alone, and I'm not sorry for yesterday. If the stars light you, today they're your guide. You feel so strong, you think, no one can touch you... - What's up? - I won't wet the bed tomorrow. - What? - I won't wet the bed tomorrow! Good! OK, go inside. - How are you? - Fine. - You have fun? - Yeah. You know the earth always revolves around its own axis. It also revolves around the sun. But the moon, which is a satellite, revolves around the earth. When the moon goes between the sun and the earth, an astronomical phenomenon occurs, and we call this a solar eclipse. The moon's shadow is cast on the earth's surface. It's interesting, because it's subjective. It depends on the subject looking at it. What we see here today in Madrid... ...is not what they see in Barcelona, or in Paris. Next slide, please. We can clearly see two different areas: the shadow, or umbra area, and the penumbra area. The umbra has no light, in total darkness. Do YOU HAVE IT? The penumbra is the fragile shadow area. Superstition has given many explanations for eclipses. Next slide, please. Primitive cultures believed... ...that the sky reflected what happened on earth. So they believed that during eclipses... ...darkness reigned over light. In many cultures, they thought that eclipses... ...were a good time for sacrifices. Next slide, please. Even human sacrifices. In fact, they'll explain it better in History class, but... ...the Maya believed that human blood was... Well, we're out of time. We have to go see the eclipse, but when we come back, we'll talk about the different kinds. Sara, help me with the window, please. If you don't have a picture, take it from the box over there, OK? OK. And remember not to look at the sun, only look through the negative. - Wait a minute. - No, let's go. - Just a second. - Girls, upstairs! - Rosa, turn the projector off. - OK. Wait... What's wrong? We have to wait for Diana. The one who got held back? Yeah, I told her what we were doing and she wants to come. Rosa, it was supposed to be between the two of us. Well, now it's between us, and Diana. She's really nice, anyway. Besides... Remember Manolo? With the spiked hair? The one who died in a motorcycle wreck! - He was her boyfriend. - Why'd you have to tell her? Sorry, it just slipped out. But everybody knows it works better with odd numbers. Everyone's upstairs. The coast is clear now. Begoña, what is this junk? Not with these! Girls! Get in place, it's about to start. Come on, over here. Look, the negatives and the... Gross! Stay together. It's this way! Hey, wait for me! Here. This is disgusting. Have you guys done this before? Yeah, in my village. You said you have too, right? Yeah, but with paper cut-outs, you know? Never with an official board. THE GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE OCCULT They're dead, but that doesn't mean they know everything, right? What did you bring? A picture. What is that? You need a personal item of the person you want to contact. A picture isn't a personal item! Of course it is! It's personal if it belongs to the person in the picture. I didn't bring any of Manolo's stuff. Can you see it? The moon is going between. See the ring? See it? Look, it's the solar ring. I can't believe it! Always look through... Look at it with this, OK? It's so beautiful! It says to put your index finger on the glass. - Close your eyes. - Why? Because you make contact faster. Is anyone with us? Is there anyone here with us? It wasn't me, I swear! Who are you? You want to talk to one of us? Are you...? Are you Veronica's Dad? Do you want to talk to Veronica? S... P... Y... I spy. - What do you spy? - With my little eye... - What are you, a dumbass? - You're the dumbass! I know you're moving it. Vero, did you move it? Who are you? It burns! Vero, are you OK? What's happening? Vero! No! Vero! Please, Vero, let's go! Please, Vero! Find the flashlight! Diana, the flashlight! - Where is it? - Over there! - Rosa, I can't see! - Fuck! Here it is! I've got it, I've got it here. I've got it. Fuck! The board is broken. Where's Veronica? Veronica? Veronica! - Diana, go get help now! - We're gonna get in trouble. Just go! Shut up! Veronica. Veronica! What's wrong? What are you saying? Veronica. Can you hear me? What happened to me? You fainted. Follow my finger. We tried to call your Mom, but we couldn't get ahold of her. She's working. Have you ever fainted like this before? No. Did you eat breakfast? Yes. Are you diabetic? Veronica! Would you listen to me? Are you diabetic? I don't know. Blood sugar, any problems? I don't know. Family history with diabetes? I don't think so. Did you take any drugs? - Pot, pills...? - No, no. - You sure? - I'm sure. Are you on your period? - Veronica, how old are you? - Fifteen. And you haven't had your period? It's probably low blood pressure. You might have an iron deficiency. If you can, I recommend eating red meat today. Rest here for a few minutes. Class is almost over. - That's so cool! - Girls! We always have to wait for you! What happened to your hand? I cut it on some glass during recess. Will you let me see? - Where's Rosa? - They left already. - They didn't wait for me? - You missed the eclipse. - The sun was totally dark. - The sun was black. It was really cool. Why weren't you there? I was in the nurse's office. Hey, don't tell Mom about this. - About what? - About my cut, OK? - Zip your lips... - Zip your lips... ...zip your lips... ...and throw away the key. Come on, let's go. - What's wrong, Irene? - Sister Death is looking at you. But she's blind, she can't see anything. She's blind. - Wasn't she deaf? - No, blind, not deaf. BEST MOM IN THE WORLD - Hi, Mom! - Hey there! Can I have money to play Martians? Fine, you take it. But just one round, then you go home, OK? Mom? - Not in front of the kids, man! - Mom! Give me the desserts for the 7! Stop for a second, please. Why do you cover up such a beautiful face? Mom! I'll give you Tupperware with macaroni for tonight. Mom! Get Antoñito and go home to eat. Come on! I'm starving, my stomach is rumbling. - They're farts. - You're the one farting. Farts, farts, farts... - Irene, heat up the food. - Why me? - I always have to do it! - Antoñito, go wash your hands. Because I'm the favorite. What's that? Nothing. Go set the table. Vero! Didn't I tell you to set the table? You keep an eye on it. - This much? - Yeah. Then, in front of the sun, there was... - It was all black and dark. - It was the moon! You didn't understand what the science teacher said. Imagine a black ball and then a yellow ball. The black one covers the yellow one, which is the sun. - Irene, can you get some milk? - You get it! Rock, paper or scissors? Rock, paper, scissors. One, two, three. Now! - I won! - No, best two out of three. Rock, paper, scissors. One, two, three. Now! Rock, paper, scissors. One, two, three. Now! Crap! I beat you, I beat you, I beat you... - You cheated. - I cheated? You cheated! I never complain when you win. There's no milk left in the fridge, over. It's in the pantry, over. Veronica? Veronica? Hello? Irene, come here. Veronica's all frozen up. Veronica? Veronica? - Veronica! - Good thing it says easy-open. Veronica! What happened? You weren't moving. And you puked. Are you OK? I'm fine. Clean this up, please. I'll get it. Yeah, OK. Yeah, I'll tell her. Bye-bye. Who was it? Rosa. Why didn't you give me the phone? She said she couldn't come, she has to run some errands with her mom. She didn't ask to talk to me? No. Hello? Hi, it's Veronica. Is Rosa there? Hi, Vero. No, she isn't here. But she just called. She just went out the door with Diana... I thought all three of you were meeting. Vero. Yeah, yeah. I'm running late. Tell her not to forget that she has to be home by eight. OK, I'll let her know. Thanks, sweetheart. See you soon. Centella gives me time to enjoy, Centella, Centella. Centella gives me time to enjoy... Girls, put your PJs on. Seven! You're in the bathroom! Doesn't count! Vero told. Let's start over. Centella gives me time to enjoy... Antoñito, that's enough! You sound like a parrot! If you don't know the jingle, why are you singing it? Yeah, yeah. I see you... Oh, time to myself... Oh, time for life... Centella gives me time to enjoy... Centella... Girls, behave. Scrub hard, I'll be right back. Girls, please. What? Oh, time to myself, time for life... Centella gives me time to enjoy... Vero. Vero! Antoñito! Antoñito! - Vero! - Antoñito! Vero! Antoñito! Antoñito, what's wrong? It burns! What happened? What happened? - What is that? - It burns. Did you touch the faucet? I didn't do anything. One, two, three, guess! - A bird. - No. A flower. No. A dog. Turn over. One, two, three, guess! - A balloon! - Yes! I'm sorry I put the water on so hot. It wasn't you. What? It wasn't you. What did you say? I won't wet the bed tomorrow. Centella gives me time to enjoy, Centella, Centella. Centella gives me a shiny floor, Centella, Centella. Oh, time to myself, Time for life. Centella gives me time to enjoy, Centella, Centella. Let's go... ...leave this room, go to outer space... ...your eyes glaze over... ...all the same color. Let's go, leave this room... ...go to outer space, your eyes glaze over... ...all the same color. While nothing matters! Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One! Vero... What are you doing here? Veronica... Veronica... Veronica... Veronica... Dad? FRIDAY, JUNE 13TH, 1991 08:29 A.M. Antoñito, what's wrong? It just leaked out. It's 8:30? - Come on, run! - Why's it always Veronica's fault? - No, no, don't close! - Please, just a second! - By the skin of your teeth. - Thank you. Thank you! Becquer's "Legends" started... ...with an introduction to transport the reader back in time. A character would warn the protagonist about a prohibition, and then, this main character would cross the allowed limit... ...and suffer punishment for their infraction. Alonso and Beatriz die because of Beatriz's imprudence... ...when she forced Alonso to go up of the Mount of Spirits... ...on All Saints Day. In "The Kiss," Lope de Ayala attacks... ...his captain for profaning the statue of Doña Elvira. In short, no one escapes the consequences... ...of passing the limit that divides reality from fantasy. Please open your copy of "Legends," we're going to read "The Mount of Spirits" together. So I'll start. "On the night of the dead, the pealing of the bells... ...woke me at who knows what hour; the monotonous and eternal tolling... ...brought to mind this tradition..." - Yes? - May I go to the bathroom? Of course. "Once prodded, the imagination is a horse run wild ..." You know when you go inside a house, and they've just made French toast? It's easy to tell the smell. That smell of cinnamon... Fried bread... Warm milk. If you close your eyes, it's like they're on a dish in front of you. You could almost take a bite. I was a Language and Lit teacher. The French toast is a metaphor. - What grade are you in? - Ninth. So you know what a metaphor is, right? And you also know we aren't talking about desserts. - Do you smoke? - No. Good. They call you Sister Death. I know. - That doesn't bother you? - No. I like it. Better than Sister Narcisa, right? What's in your hand? How do you know I'm holding something? You don't always need eyes to see. Can I see? What you did here is really dangerous. I just wanted to talk to my Dad. It's not who you want to talk to. It's who you talk to. If it isn't my Dad, then who is it? - You have siblings, don't you? - Three of them. You'll have to protect them. Protect them from what? You all stop moving! Stop moving! You all stop moving! Don't move! But I'm alone. No. You aren't alone. Someone answered your call. And now walks with you. Don't move. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, leave this body that does not belong to you. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, leave this body that does not belong to you. Recess is over, girl. Run, run, run. Maybe you'll get away. Rosa! Hi! Who's that? Felipe, my cousin's classmate from trade school. - What did you want? - You're mad at me. Vero, why would I be mad at you? You didn't come over yesterday. I had to go with my Mom, didn't your sister tell you? It's because of yesterday, isn't it? The ouija board is stupid. You say dumb stuff and move a glass. You noticed something, too. Rosa! - You saw it, too, didn't you? - Saw what, Vero? - Since yesterday, I've been seeing... - Rosa! We have to go quick, the store is going to close. - Are you coming? - Where? We're throwing a party because Rosa's parents are gone this weekend. Why didn't you tell me? Dude, she's telling you now. Besides, I doubt you can come, right? You have to babysit your brother and sisters. Let's go. Vero! - Drop by if you can. - Come on, we're late! Lucia, stop copying my homework! THE GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE OCCULT This is boring! It's always the same! Antoñito, that's enough! Go play in your room. Lucia, stop copying your sister's homework, you won't learn! - I learn when I copy, too. - You're such a piece of work. You're going to do it, anyway. Why do you care? You're so selfish! You're always the same! Then you do it one day and I'll copy! We could do rock, paper, scissors but you do it better. It's not that I do it better... You have siblings, don't you? You'll have to protect them. VIKING SYMBOLS OF PROTECTION Representing Madrid, Lucia Gomez, 19 years old... ...she is a doctor, lawyer, lifeguard and firefighter. But there's a secret nobody knows about Miss Madrid: she's a robot! And the robot has super duper smart artificial intelligence. Miss Madrid, soon to be contender for Miss Spain. What's that? A thing we made in class. How ugly! Take that, Miss Madrid! Will you win the crown as Miss Spain? Yes or no! Soon in theaters near you. Miss Madrid is 25 years old, has 7 children... Who is it? Josefa. - Where's your Mom? - At the bar. Uh-huh. Wanna tell me what you all are up to? What's wrong? The lamps! Are you dancing or what? The lamps won't stop shaking! - We're not doing anything. - Really? It looks like my ceiling is going to crash on me. Something else: I've got a huge black stain, right on top of your bedroom. You have moisture problems? - I don't know, I'll tell my Mom later. - Yeah, right! If you see her, that is, huh? You'll sleep well tonight with all that running around. Fucking kids. Shit! Veronica. Veronica. What are you doing awake? Lucia, it isn't funny. I can see your room from here. Help us. You're the one who called. Don't let it hurt us. Irene! Lucia! Lucia! Girls, wake up! Lucia! Vero! Vero! What are you doing? There was someone here who wanted to hurt you. There's no one in here! We can't see it, but it's here. Look! The amulets got burned. Take your mattresses, let's go. We're sleeping together in the living room. I'm getting Antoñito. It's Benahavis. Vero. Go to sleep. Why were you choking me? I wasn't choking you. I was protecting you. From who? From something bad that came inside the house. Who came inside the house? Josefa? No. A being from the other side. An evil being. A ghost? A spirit? Don't be scared. I'll protect you guys. Because you're the oldest? I'm glad you're my big sister. I'm glad you're my little sister. I'm not little. I'm in the middle, because Irene came out after. That's right. Go to sleep. I'll keep watch. - Sorry, what's going on? - It's a festival in Benahavis! Veronica... Vero, what's wrong? What's going on? It's back. What's this? - Mommy! - Mommy! Can you tell me what's going on here? - A bad man wanted to kill Lucia. - Lucia, are you OK? Someone came in the house? No, they didn't come inside. They were already here. - Vero! - Nothing happened, Mom. But was someone in the house or not? - No. - Yes. - I'm calling the police. - A spirit. - What? - Yeah, a ghost. I didn't see it, but Vero did. - Were you watching scary movies again? - Kind of. Don't worry, Mom. Vero protects us from the spirit. Come on, let's pick all this up and go to bed. And you go to your room! - But, Mom... - No buts! Go to your room. What happened? - Tell me! - Nothing. Your sisters are little and they've got a huge imagination. Don't give them weird ideas because then they can't sleep. How do you know if they can or can't sleep? You're never home! You don't know what goes on here. So what goes on here? - He wants to hurt us! - Who?! I don't know! I'm the one who called him with the ouija board. You played the ouija board with your sisters? - No, with Rosa! - But... Why are you playing with such dark things? I wanted to talk to Dad. I know you don't care. You stuffed his pictures in a box so you don't have to look at him. Don't say that! - I just wanted to talk to him! - That's enough! You're reading too much of that stuff, and it's having an effect on you. It's the truth. Vero... I need you to grow up. I need to be able to count on you. Because I'm on my own. I'm the one on my own. You're not making it easy. I'm really tired. We'll talk more tomorrow. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! - Vero! - Vero, get up! - Wake up! - Come on! - Come on! - Get up! Let's go! Leave me alone, let me sleep! - We're hungry! - Come on! We've got lots to do! We're hungry! - What are you doing? - We're hungry! Get out, leave me alone! - Come on! - Get up! Let's play a game. Give me your arm. What are you talking about? What are you doing? Stop it! Stop! Don't! Mom! Mom! Help me, Mom! Mom, help me! Mom, Mom! Mom, Mom... Mom! Leave me alone! Mom! Mom! Mom, help me! Mom... Help me, Mom. - I can't hear you. - Mom! I need you to grow up. Mom... Mom! Mom...! Mom! Mom! SATURDAY, JUNE 14TH, 1991 10:40 A.M. - Did you make breakfast? - Wait for the show to finish. Always the same, I'm sick of you guys! Wait. Why's this book here? You don't know how to read! Dad came to read it to me. Come again? Dad came to read it to me. - Dad came? - He's coming back again tonight. What else did he say? That he's going to take me to where he lives. Antoñito, listen to me. Listen. If he comes back, don't listen to him, OK? Plug your ears. How do you plug your ears? Great, like that. And you call me, OK? Yell my name really loud. OK? Kids, let's go! - Hi, Mom! - Hey there! - What are you doing here? - I need to go to Rosa's house. - Right now? - For homework. Can they stay here? - Yeah. But come back soon! - OK! They're right. You're a crazy old woman. - Then why are you back? - You can see the shadows, like me! Maybe we're both crazy. I've been trying to stop seeing them for a long time. I did this to myself, you know? Back then I didn't know you don't need eyes to see. I don't know how to protect myself from them. Amulets and crosses don't work, they don't scare them! Crosses? God has got nothing to do with it. Leave Him out of it. How can I make them go away? The same way they came in. They have to go back through the door you opened. Bid them farewell. Then you'll have to destroy it. - Destroy the ouija board? - No, the door! You have to do right what you did wrong. What's wrong? Sister, again? I don't know how you can get all the way down here. What are you doing here on a Saturday? Sister was helping me with a project. She's in no condition to help anyone. This way, Sister. The answer is in the books. Look what great advice she gives. You have to do right what you did wrong. Careful, Sister. "You have to do right what you did wrong."

Whatever you don't say goodbye to, stays with you. - What? - It says so right here. - Cut the bullshit. - We have to do it again! - Put it away! - Let's go to your room. Where's Diana? - Calm down! - Where's Diana? - Put it away! - Diana! - Let's go to your room. Diana! - Veronica! Diana! Where's Diana, have you seen her? - Veronica! - Diana! Have you seen Diana? Have you seen Diana? What are you talking about? Diana! Have you seen Diana? - No. - Who is Diana? Diana! - Diana! - No, what's your problem? Diana! - You haven't seen her? - Veronica, please. Diana! Diana! Diana. Diana, come here. - What the fuck are you doing? - Come on, we have to do it. - Do what? - The three of us together. - Let me go, you're crazy! - Come on, Diana! - Leave me alone! - Let go of me! - Kicking you the hell out! - Come on, Diana, Rosa! Rosa! Rosa! Rosa, we have to do it again. - You don't remember, do you? - Remember what? You whispered something to me the other day. What did I say? Tell me, Rosa! You said you were going to die today. - What? - Vero, I'm sorry. - What did you say? - We were scared, we didn't... What's that? Did you bite yourself? No, Rosa. I didn't. Come on, let's go. Rosa! Rosa! Rosa! Mom! Hey, you're in the way! Can we go home now? Wait. Mom! Where were you all day? Take the kids, they can't stay here forever! Give me the leftovers for the kids. Coming! This is always dirty. Because you always get it dirty. Mom! Mom! What? Mom, close the bar. Right now, let's all go somewhere. What are you talking about? Mom, it doesn't come when you're home. Here we go again... I'd love to close and eat with you, but I can't. - Ana! - Coming. Look... Want to go to the park tomorrow? To spend the day, like before. What do you think? I'll make sandwiches to eat there. You want to? Ana, the leftovers! You grab them. Kids, let's go. Finally! - Let's go. - Are we going home? Let's go, sweetheart. Veronica! Veronica! Goal! Pedro Riesco scored. After Ribera's mistake, the first goal in the game for the team... You have to do right what you did wrong. - We're going to play a game. - What game? We're going to play a game where you have to do what I say. This game sucks. Grab the candles in the top drawer. Antoñito, draw this on the hallway walls. - OK! - Great. I get to draw on the wall. Mom's going to ground you until you're at least 40. Move the furniture. We need to have space. SATURDAY, JUNE 14TH, 1991 23:45 VIKING SYMBOLS OF PROTECTION SYMBOLS OF INVOCATION Not you. Just the three of us. Sit over there. You guys close your eyes. Is anyone here with us? Is there anyone here with us? Who's here with us? Are you here? Yes. We're here to say goodbye to you.

"To properly conclude the séance and bid farewell, participants should sing a mantra or a soft song." - We didn't do that, either. - What's a mantra? I don't know. But it says a soft song works, too. Which one? One all three of us know. Centella. Centella gives me time to enjoy... Centella, Centella. Centella gives me time to enjoy... What is that? Centella, Centella.
