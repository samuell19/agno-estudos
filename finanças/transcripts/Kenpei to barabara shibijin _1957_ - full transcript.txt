Why don't you say something? Fine then. I've heard about your rich girlfriend. Now I see it's true. - You lied to me. - What are you talking about? Now I see. I'm... inconvenient. I'll see your commanding officer. Wait... why? To show him this photograph of us... and ask what he thinks should be done. - Don't do anything rash. - What am I supposed to do? All right then... I'll marry you. I'll marry you if you insist. I'm so glad. Remember your promise. Remember... If it weren't for this woman...

You try it! Here. It stinks too. I thought something smelled rotten. Attention! Watch your mouths, you recruits! That's regimental water you're talking about. We cook with that water. It's precious. Understand? Now who's got a complaint?! What is it, Yoneyama? Sir! The recruits were complaining about the water. Hmm. Maybe there's disinfectant in it? Yoneyama, you try it. Take a good look. This water's fine! My God! Sir, they're right. It smells terrible! Yoneyama, open the well. Ugh! Smells like fish guts, sir! God, it really stinks! Something's floating down there. Right. Haul it up! God, what is that smell?! - Bet it's a pig. - Got to be tuna. Attention! We've discovered an unidentified object in the well. I see. It's human. A human torso! MP Headquarters. A woman's torso? Tohoku Teidai University, Forensic Medicine. Yes... yes... yes... One moment please. Sir, the MPs have requested a post-mortem for a suspicious death. Death occurred approximately six months ago. The victim was a woman of 22 or 23 years of age... and five months pregnant. That's the foetus. The head and limbs were severed by an extremely sharp instrument. Normally the body would have decomposed by now. But in this case, the cool water temperature in the well preserved it. Attention! Eat! - Yamamoto! - Sir? - Take mine. Here! - Sir! - And mine too. Eat up! - Yes. Something wrong? Eat it! Let's eat! They cooked that in the well water. Like it? Hey, Kosugi! How does pregnant corpse soup taste? Not bad, eh? Attention! Why aren't you men eating? Sir, my stomach is upset! The same, Sir! Liars! You were ordered not to talk about the well. Stop bullying recruits. Get back there and eat! Everyone eat! - Let's eat! - Let's eat! So how does a severed corpse taste? Eat like soldiers! If you can't take this, you'll never survive combat rations. Now eat! Severed Female Torso Found in Army Well "Head & Limbs Still Missing" Whoever broke the gag order... has set our investigation back to square one. As officers you must use your full ability to uncover the truth... bring the criminal to justice... and be models of the true MP spirit. I'm Chief Moriya of the Sendai Police. - This is Detective Mawatani. - How do you do. Welcome. I'm Deputy Commander Sakamoto, and this is Sergeant Hagiyama. Please sit. We'll come straight to the point. May we see the crime scene? Unfortunately, as you know, police are not permitted on base. But... the victim is a civilian woman and that does make it our jurisdiction. But this base is under Imperial Army jurisdiction. You are free to investigate, but only outside the compound. You shouldn't have to bother with this yourselves. We can help. Surely there's no harm in that? Hold it! Are you suggesting that we can't do it? No, not at all. Then let us do our work, and wait for the result! Seems we have no choice but to give up on the crime scene. I can't stand those pushy MPs. What's wrong with the police, bringing in such a rude Detective? Never mind that. We've never had a case like this. I want you to lead the investigation. We've checked all our men and found no irregularities. Now we're looking into their female contacts. The Investigation Continues. Murderer & Victim Still Unknown. Then, One Month Later... Sir, this says an MP investigator is arriving from HQ. Is that true? Oh, is it official already? The C.O. made that request himself. But this is an insult to our Regiment! Yes. But I also understand our C.O.'s position. He will arrive today. Karita has gone to meet him. Entering! Sergeant Karita reporting, sir! Sergeant, where is the MP from Tokyo? He wanted to inspect the well himself on the way here. Oh, already on the job, is he? - What? Without reporting here first? - Yes, sir. What arrogance! "New Development in Investigation. Staff Sergeant Kosaka arrives today." - Kaneda? - Sir? Where's that Tokyo MP? He's inside, reporting to the C.O. and Deputy. Tokyo MPs certainly are a fidgety lot. Can't sit still for a minute. I think something's wrong with them, if you ask me! Sir, have you met Sergeant Kosaka's aide? He came with him from Tokyo. Let me introduce myself. Corporal Takayama. How do you do? Sergeant Karita. - Kaneda? - Sir? Don't you think Tokyo MPs are just a bunch of lightweights? Yes, sir. The C.O. is under great pressure. I trust you'll do the job. I'll rely on your guidance as I'm a stranger here. That didn't stop you from going to the crime scene before reporting. You Tokyo MPs are a hard-working lot. Yes, we're all very impressed. - Sergeant? - Sir? Are you staying at the single men’s barracks? No sir. I'll be staying with an acquaintance of mine. Very well then. With your permission. Do you have an acquaintance here, sir? No. It just seemed better this way. We'll stay somewhere else. Will you find us a place? Yes, sir! Actually, I have friends here. We can stay there for sure. Welcome. Aren't you... aren't you Shino's sister? Yes... Wait... But... you're... - Yes! You're Okiyo. - Yes. - I'm Takayama! - Why... Little Chu... You grew up! Yes, I'm Takayama Chukichi. Full-grown now. Welcome. - Tea is ready. - Thank you. If the room is adequate, I hope you'll stay. I'm sorry to put you to such trouble. Not at all. But... we work downstairs. So I'm afraid we can't offer much. No problem. We'll be fine on our own. Little Chu, have some tea. Yes! Thank you! Sister? Shino, introduce yourself. All right. - Welcome. - My younger sister. I'm Kosaka. Pleased to meet you. Sister... I'd always heard MPs were gorillas, but these ones look pretty nice. Shino! - I'm afraid she's still immature. - I'm sorry. Shino, hello! Well, well... It's Little Chu! You look just like an adult! - Thank you for coming all this way. - Not at all. Frankly, if all MPs were like you, my job would be much easier. Oh, we MPs need police cooperation to do our jobs. I'm delighted to hear that. I promise to cooperate. My regards. So he's sucking up to the police. There's nothing so great about Tokyo MPs after all. Karita, what is it? There's a witness who saw someone throw something in the well. Yes! I definitely heard something being thrown into the well. I see. Sit down. Yes, sir! When was this? Well, I don’t recall the exact day... but... it was right before we left for Manchuria. Everyone was working late into the night when something woke me. I got up to have a look. I fell back asleep for 10 minutes, but awoke to the sound of footsteps. It was Sergeant Tsuneyoshi. Tanaka, keep it to yourself... but my girl can't get enough! That's why I’m late. Was he always this late? Yes, usually. He's a good-looking guy, very popular with the ladies. Did you ever see his girl? No, I never saw her. Tsuneyoshi was assigned to KP work duty. Kitchen Patrol? Yes. But now he's at Regimental Headquarters. I see... Check on Tsuneyoshi That's right. I knew Tsuneyoshi well. Tell me all you know about him. Well he was always going to the Kiyoi brothel. Who was his girl? Fumiko. But she's not there any more. Not there? Why? Yes, I heard she quit suddenly. She just left. I see. Check with the Madam at Kiyoi Brothel. Yes... Fumi was crazy about him. Absolutely head over heels. Was she pregnant? Now... how would I know that? - As a woman, couldn't you tell? - No, not at all. - When did she leave? - Just before the division left. They'd had a quarrel, and she had been crying. - A quarrel? - Yes. You know when you're young, and in the heat of the moment... it's easy to say things you don't mean. Anyhow, she mentioned something about getting married and then just disappeared. But Tsuneyoshi is still around. I wonder what happened. Maybe she found someone else? Regimental Headquarters? Oh, Tsuneyoshi... it's me, Shirai. Listen, the MPs have been asking about you. I think they suspect. - Here? - Yes, sir. - Help yourself. - Thank you. Where are the goods? - Hidden in the same place. - Then let's do it tonight. No. The MPs are on to us. We have to be careful. Right. - Better report back. - Yes, sir. Tell me doctor... how much did the torso weigh at the time of death? I'd say 60 to 65 pounds. Could one person carry it? That wouldn't be possible. - Then perhaps a handcart? - Maybe. - How could this have been done? - With an extremely sharp blade. How long would it take an amateur to do it? An interesting thought. Someone experienced could do it in about 20 minutes. But an amateur might take an hour or so. - An hour? - Yes. An hour... An hour... Where could someone dissect a body for an hour... and not be seen? The base is too well-guarded, so that's out. An hour... moved by handcart... An hour... where no one could see you... Where could it be? I must know! Thanks very much. You're welcome. Please take care. He comes back around 9 or 10pm every night. I hope they find the killer soon for the sake of that poor girl. How true. He seems quite considerate for an MP. There's no "seems" about it! He is very considerate. Okiyo, have you taken a liking to him? I like any customer who pays on time. Oh, here he is now. - Welcome back. - Thank you. Hello there. You're putting in long days. This... is Detective Mawatani. I'm Kosaka. How do you do? Can I borrow you for a moment? - But I... - Only for a moment. Come, come, come. Welcome back. Sit, sit, sit. Please join me over here. - A bottle, please. - Yes, sir. Mr. Kosaka, to be honest, I couldn't stand MPs before. Oh, I'm sure there are some good ones, of course. But most just seem to throw their weight around. Take that Hagiyama for example. Always mocking the police. The police should be respected. They serve the Emperor, just as we do. Exactly! Oh, and thank you for coming to our station. You're someone I'll gladly cooperate with. I appreciate that. But let's have that drink. To your health. If you don't mind, I'll be going now. That's fine. How is your son? His surgery is set for tomorrow. Poor thing. You can take tomorrow off too. Oh, thank you. Well, I'll be going. I hope it all goes well. Okiyo, did she say surgery? Yes, her son is a soldier in the Army Hospital. - The Army Hospital? - That's right. - Would you bring him another? - Yes. I ask that you please protect my son. Divine one... even if you decide that he must lose an arm or leg I pray that you at least spare his life. Lord Hachiman, please bestow... Hachiman, bestow your boundless power... and deep mercy to watch over and protect my son. Please, I beg of you... surgery... hospital... Army Hospital... An operating room! A body could be dismembered there without being seen... even for an hour. The Army Hospital isn't far from Regimental HQ. Then the criminal used an operating room? I'm still not sure. But if he did, then the rest of the body must be hidden nearby. I must find the missing head and limbs, and return the body to its proper state, no matter what. Or the poor spirit will never be able to go to the next life. Sendai Army Hospital Morgue (praying) Ma'am, I'm sorry about your son. Thank you... Thank you. Takayama, stick your head down there. Yes, sir! Deep enough to hide a head, wouldn't you say? Is the head down there? That's what I intend to find out. Let’s have it checked. Sir, I'll arrange it immediately! Hold it! Wait a minute. It's human hair. Carry on! - Hey! I found something! - Pull it up quickly! Fasten the two ends there. Yes, that's fine. Mr. Kosaka, it's a perfect match. Now with the body rejoined, it can become a proper spirit. I know you want vengeance. I swear I'll find your killer. Why don't you confess?! The Tokyo MPs found her body! I... - I don't know anything! - Damn it! We've got a witness who saw you throw her in the well. But I didn’t! I was on duty then. I couldn't have killed her. Then where is she? No one's seen her anywhere! So you transferred, sold her clothes, and bought whores with the money! Her spirit's going to come for you! - I swear I didn't kill Fumiko! - Damn it! You keep lying. We'll have to beat it out of you. Hey! Move it! Son... of... a... BITCH! Tsuneyoshi is guilty. I know it. Everything about him is suspicious. Suspicion isn't proof. Do you have any proof that he's not guilty? None. Then don't criticise my methods! But I do object to the torture of suspects. Strongly. And I don't condone its use to extract confessions. I think Tsuneyoshi is only guilty of violating military protocol. The witness said he saw him throw her body in the well. But Tsuneyoshi was on duty at that time. As Head of KP, he could easily steal provisions from the warehouse and carry them to the meeting place where his contact waited. They always made the exchange at the back of the compound. Both sides knew the routine well, as they had done it many times before. This is how Tsuneyoshi gained money for prostitutes. Then Fumiko got pregnant and became a burden so he killed her. And you found her head and limbs. Excellent work. But even he admits that Fumiko was his woman. Just a moment. The body I found hasn't been positively identified. It's Fumiko, obviously. It's too early to say for certain. He'll confess soon. Commander, I propose we first establish the victim's identity. That's the only way to discover who the murderer is. That's your way! Commander, I'll use my own methods. You stubborn bastard! - Still no confession? - Nothing. - Continue. - Sir! - Go on. Drink. - Thank you, sir. Sergeant Karita, that Tsuneyoshi is really tough. No, he'll break soon. I'm back. - Welcome back. - Hello. - Sit down. - Thanks. - Has Sergeant Kosaka returned? - No. He'll stop by the hospital first. Oh, I see. Your boss is big on discipline, but not so good at catching criminals. Every day at the hospital... I guess he likes the local girls. Bastard! Don't you dare insult Sergeant Kosaka! Insult? I'm just worried for him! Getting mixed up with girls makes all MPs look bad. You bastard! - Please stop. - Like hell I will! Watch what you say about the Sergeant! - Mr. Takayama, stop! - Let me go! Chu! I just hate men who fight! Okay. I'll stop! These four patients were transferred from HQ. Are they still here? No. They all went to Manchuria. I'd like to see their photographs, if you have them. Sister, look! This is Taeko's fiancé. Oh really? - Hey, give it back! - No way! Stop it. Shino! Welcome back. Thank you. Welcome back, sir. - This is Shino's friend, Taeko. - Pleased to meet you. And this is her fiancé. Isn't he handsome? - Give it back! - No! Give it back! - I'm sorry they're so noisy. - Not at all. I'll change by myself. Please tend the store. It's no problem. We're not open yet. Thanks. They say Taeko's fiancé volunteered to go to Manchuria. - Volunteered? - Yes. - Oh, thank you. - Not at all. Leaving behind such a pretty girl... men are so fickle! If he were mine, I'd hold on to him tight. Is your fiancé a soldier? Oh... no, I don't have a fiancé. Who would want an old spinster like me? Excuse me... will you eat now? - Yes, please. - Right. This man's fiancée is currently staying at my lodging. We haven't checked the others yet, but I want their women investigated. Out of the entire regiment, these four are our best suspects. All were enlisted men, and each had an assistant. If we could interview those men, I know we'll find a lead. Where are they now? All were discharged and have returned home. Here are their addresses. Takayama, look into this tomorrow, and tell me what you find. Yes, sir. First thing. Have you learned the victim's identity yet? No, and it's been troubling me. Those photographs reminded me that before soldiers go to Manchuria, they usually take a photograph with their girl as a memento. If we went to the local studios and checked their negatives, we might find a photograph of the victim, and identify her. What an excellent idea! Would you follow up, Detective Mawatani? Yes, of course. He's here. That is the MP whom I told you about. He's asking about Sergeant Kimizuka. - Pleased to know you. - Likewise. Just to clarify... you both worked for Kimizuka at the hospital. Is that correct? Yes. Did you notice anything unusual about his behaviour? Well... there was that time with the bundle. Remember? - A bundle? - That's right. We were to pick up Sergeant Kimizuka's gear and take it to the hospital. There is one more. Follow me. Sir! - Then where did you go? - Just outside the Operating Room. - There was a big bundle in the hall. - All wrapped up. - Wrapped in cloth? - No, neatly wrapped in straw. This is valuable medicine. Be careful moving it. Yes, sir! - Damn, it’s heavy! - Must be at least 80 pounds. Hey! Cut the chat and move it! Yes, sir. We laid it outside the kitchen. It was soaking wet and weighed a ton. I remember thinking at the time, "Tsk, this is strange!" Let’s see. This one’s nice too. Wait a minute. He's back. Our MP. - I'm back - Welcome back. - Welcome back! - Oh, thank you. - Hey, sister? - Eh? - That was fast. - What was? Your welcoming our guest, of course! Shino... you little... Don't! As punishment, "I hereby order myself to help Taeko with her wedding dress. "End of orders!" Silly girl. - Is Taeko here? - Yes. - Welcome back. - Thank you. Which one do you like, sister? Come take a look. Excuse me a moment. Her fiancé comes back from Manchuria soon and then they'll have a ceremony. Is that so? Congratulations to you both. - Sister, what about this one? - Let me see that one. Kimizuka has a beautiful fiancée. What was in that bundle? Did he have another lover? And whose torso was... wrapped in that bundle? Who are you?! If we only knew your identity, we could find your killer. Tell me who you are! If you aren't Fumiko, then let us know somehow. Or Tsuneyoshi will surely be tortured to death. Who are you?! Who?! Oh, there you are! I came to pick you up. - Takayama! - Sir? Look, two of the teeth have fillings. The dentist who filled them should remember. Do you think so? Let's check the local dentists and find out. This definitely isn't my work. It appears they were filled 2 to 3 months before death. Not me! Besides, I never work on corpses! This is indeed my work. - It was you? - That's right. If memory serves... The name was Ito Yuriko. The address was in care of the Local Prefectural Government 21 years of age. Worked as a maid for a local Accountant. You want me to go to the Accountant's house? Could you? I doubt they would talk to an MP. I need to know if someone named Ito Yuriko lives there. Okiyo will you help me? - Does that mean no? - No, I'll go. Really? Thank you! - I'm obliged to you. - Oh, it's all right. Besides, I could never refuse a request from you. - Thank you for waiting. - Sorry to bother you. Actually, Yuriko quit last March. Oh, I see... And who are you? Oh, we are old friends. Do you know where she moved to? She sent this postcard from Yokosuka. The address is on it. Take it, if you like. It says she's getting married soon. I suppose that means she's still alive. Maybe not. The postmark says April. But the post-mortem revealed that she was killed in March. She must be dead. Besides, this is a man's handwriting. Yokosuka city, care of Kimizuka Liquor store. KIMIZUKA LIQUOR - Who? This fellow? - Yes. - Welcome. - Thank you. If I recall correctly, my brother Hachiro was dispatched to Manchuria on 5th April. Oh, I see. Is there a problem? No, I just hoped to see my old pal. I didn't know he had been mobilised. Would you know where in Manchuria he's stationed? I'd like to write to him, if possible. We just got word from him yesterday. - Could you bring that postcard? - Yes. - Just a moment please. - Thank you. Yes, this is it. That's his handwriting all right. - May I keep this? - Certainly. Please do. The writing matches. No doubt about it, he wrote this to make people think that Yuriko was still alive. Yes. So Kimizuka is our man? Mm, I'm sure of it. Mr. Kosaka! I found a photograph! Turns out, Kimizuka did have another woman. Look, here they are in this photograph. Detective Mawatani, thank you! Now we have the evidence we need. This must be Yuriko, the woman he murdered. Congratulations Mr. Kosaka, excellent work! I'm truly delighted that you found the criminal. I never could have done it without your help. Thank you. I'm retiring in six months, but thanks to you, working together on this case has been... the best retirement present I could imagine. Thank you. You'd better hurry to Manchuria and arrest Kimizuka. - Takayama, contact HQ immediately. - Yes, sir! Mr. Kosaka, are you going to Manchuria? I'm not sure yet. But I may have to. I see... And just when we were getting to know each other. Oh, Okiyo. Don't look so sad. It... looks like I need to... step in here and help. You two need someone to arrange your marriage. Don't you think so, Mr. Kosaka? Huh? It's only for a little while. You'll be together again. Oh, I almost forgot... I'd better report back. No, no, I know the way. Take care. Say... Shino? What is it, Little Chu? Please can you stop calling me that? But... it's your name, isn't it? Well, sort of... What do you want? Well...you see... I might have to leave soon... Oh? Going back to Tokyo? That's nice. Mr. Takayama? Mr. Takayama... It looks like you need help too. Want me to arrange your marriage? - Just leave everything to me. - Yes! Well, I'll be going now. - Take care of yourself! - Goodbye! Goodbye! Little Chu! Did he say marriage? How wonderful! Who's the girl? I can't wait to meet her! Damned hard head! Sergeant Hagiyama, there's trouble. They found Tsuneyoshi's girl. They what?! I couldn't believe it myself. After their quarrel, Fumiko just decided to run off to Hokkaido. Then today she shows up at the brothel saying she's homesick. Sorry for making everyone worry. Entering! Sergeant Hagiyama, this is Fumiko. Oh, it's you. Fumiko, stand up. Introduce yourself. I'm back at work now. Hope to see you sometime. And, as just explained, after careful evaluation of evidence uncovered during his investigation, Sergeant Kosaka was able to identify that the culprit was Sergeant Kimizuka. We express our deep gratitude to the Sergeant and all who assisted. - Sergeant Kosaka. - Sir! I order you to leave for Manchuria immediately, to apprehend the perpetrator of this crime. To that end, we have notified the local MP Headquarters of your arrival. We wish you success in your mission. Sergeant Kosaka reporting. I regret to inform you, Kimizuka escaped from the hospital. Escaped?! Word of your arrival somehow leaked. But we know where he is hiding. Kimizuka, it's no use! Surrender! Take a good look... at the torso you threw into the well. Look at the woman you murdered! You seduced, with all your lies, this poor girl Ito Yuriko. OPERATING ROOM Then you brutally dismembered her. You threw the head and limbs into the hospital well. - Take my belongings into the building. - Sir! But the torso was too large and wouldn't fit through the heavy metal grille over the well. So you ordered your assistants to move it to the Army compound. Then you set about disposing of the body. But... a problem arose... Tsuneyoshi appeared unexpectedly. The soldier on duty saw Tsuneyoshi, but not you. For six months, her body wept, soaking in a watery hell. Ito Yuriko's poor body! I'm sorry, Yuriko! Yuriko, forgive me! Forgive me! Remember, you're still a soldier. So as a soldier... face your punishment. Forgive me, Yuriko! I'm sorry! The End
