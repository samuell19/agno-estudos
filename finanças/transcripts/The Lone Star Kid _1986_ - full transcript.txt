Good morning. Good morning. Here, Fireplug. Come here, quick. Here you go, here you go. Drumstick, would you move it? Come on, Drumstick. I'm in a hurry. Can you believe only five weeks till school? Take the good with the bad. Easy for you to say. I'm the one that gets the bad grades. - It got us through last year. - Barely. - Mose, if they can put a man on the moon, we'll get you through seventh grade. - Be easier to get me to the moon. - Yeah. - Yeah? - I was just kidding. - Yeah, keep fishing. - Holmes? Holmes. Down here, boy. This is God's champagne. - Guess you don't want this here root beer. - You put that in the fridge so it get cold. - Yes sir. Here you go. I poured us a glass. - Thank you, boy. - You said you were gonna quit. I'm a old man. I forget what I say. Come on, help me. - You been eatin' all right? - Fine barbecue. You having a good day? - Yeah. Mose and I did some fishing at our place. - Yeah, everybody need that. - Fish? - No, no, people need a place where they can go and think and get answers. - Where do you go? - My head. I sit out back when I can smell the pines. And in my mind, when I see a place where I want to go, I'm there. Spend hours walking through fields filled with wild flowers, climbing mountains, floating down rivers, talking to the man. - Let's take you to my place. - That'd be fine boy. You gonna help out today? That's why I'm here. - Well, that barbecue might use a cleanin'. - Always does. I'll get started. Don't want you to starve. Boy, you ain't got no respect. - Call an ambulance, there's a phone over there. Operator. - This is an emergency. There's a bad accident on the Gilmore blacktop just past Highway 28. We need an ambulance right away. I'll connect you with Richmond County Hospital. - That's 30 miles from here. I'm sorry, that's the closest service. I'll connect you. - He didn't have to die. - It's not your fault. - It took 30 minutes for the ambulance to get there, it had to come all the way from Richmond. - Honey. Brian, look at me. You did all you could. - If we would've had an emergency station we could have helped him. - You can't blame yourself for that. - What happened to them wasn't right. - You've been down all morning. I do somethin'? - No, I'm fine. Don't worry about it. Come on. - There's 10, I'm gonna beat you this game. If you need anything else, it's in the throw pile there. - Whatever you say, we'll see. I've heard you say that before. We'll see, we'll see. Right here, here you go. There's five back at ya. Harry said it was gonna rain again? Yeah, and then it'll rain again after we've had way more than we need. - Well I wish you'd look at this. Says the next 10 years, Houston's gonna grab up a whole bunch of areas, including Crabb. - You're kidding me? That's what is says. - Well, they tax us for years without doin' nothin' for us. - Land probably be more valuable, though. - After they build a bunch of shopping malls all over. - Don't we have no say about it? Getting worse than Russia. - Well we would have a say if we'd made our own town. Y'know, we talked about doing it years ago, but nothin' ever come of it. Well, ain't nothin' I can do about it. Still waiting on the cans. Sorry. Fireplug, get out! Come on, get out. Holmes! By the shed. Hello, boy. - Brought some cans. - Dump them in the barrel. Sound like a jolly worth. - Can I talk to you about something? - Must be important. And you excited, yeah? - There's talk of Houston spreading out this way, making Crabb part of it. - Instead of living in the worst part of Crabb, I'd be living in the worst part of Houston without packing and unpacking. - You think Crabb should be its own town? - It is a town. - Nah, it's part of Richmond County. We gotta be a real town. We got needs. Police, firemen, ambulances to help people. - You got a plan? Hand me some wood. - Incorporate. - In what? - Incorporate. Looked it up in one of Dad's old law books. It's the only to get city services. But to start the process, we gotta elect a mayor. - Who would be mayor? - Didn't really get to that yet. - Need somebody who would work hard. - Yeah. - How about you, boy? - Nah, that's crazy. - Not crazy. Someone got to lead. - There's no way. - You can make things better. People believe that. You let 'em know your feelings. - Nobody'd even listen to me. - No, you smart, boy. - They'll listen. - I don't even think it'd be illegal. - Well, find out. Got to go with your feelings. That way, win or lose, you go down proud. - It's a good thing I went down today. I got the last bales. - Buster, turn around. - What's going on? - Turn around, look. - What's he doing? - He borrowed your old law books. - Maybe he wants to finish what I started. - He says he's looking into making Crabb a legal town so he can get things done. - What are you talking about? - He wants to make things right for the people of Crabb. So he decided to run for mayor. - And where did he get such a silly idea? - Don't look at me. I want you to go out there and talk to him. Make him stop this. - You're overreacting. - No, I'm not. Now he needs some straightenin' out. Go on. - All right. All right. What ya reading, son? - This is gonna be easier than I thought. - What's that? - I'm gonna make Crabb its own town. - Mom said something about you being mayor. - I'd have to hold an election and run for mayor. - Look, Brian, it's fine you wantin' to help Crabb and all, you're too young to even vote. - It doesn't matter. Look. Says that you can be a minor and being elected mayor if the town isn't incorporated. Then you can pass a law with a no age requirement for office. - Let me get a look at that. - Did you talk to him? - He really seems to know what he's doing. - Sounds like Brian did the talkin'. - According to the book, he could be mayor. - Even so, you gotta be realistic. People can be mean. They can be real tough on ya. - I'll handle it. - What about school? - I can do both. I gotta go with my feelings. - Let me see that. Thank you, Joyce. Have a nice day. You too, Lima. - Here you go, Mrs. Bostet. - Thank you. - Thanks for lettin' us hold the election here. - I'd do anything for you, you little sidewinder. - Can I borrow a pen? Thanks. Mose thinks I'm bananas. - Welcome to politics. - There. Yep, I'm officially running for mayor. If anybody else wants to, they'll have to sign up too. - What if I run? Wouldn't stand a chance. - Got to go. Have to put up some more signs. - Make sure you put one up at Jordan's Hardware. - Thanks. - No no, you got to dig the hole deeper. Here, let me show you. Otherwise, those roots won't have a chance to attach themselves. - Never could get the hang of this. Good thing you got the green thumb. - I just like to see things grow. - So do I, just can't grow 'em. - Brian! Brian! I was back at store with my mom, and two more people signed the paper. - Who? Verna Matthews and Phil Hawkins. - Why'd they sign? - 'Cause they don't want no kid mayor. - So what are you gonna do? - I don't know. - Well, you're sure no help around here. You got to get out there and start knocking on doors. - What do you mean? - Well, campaign. Tell the people what you're about, what you aim to do. - I'm going with you. We've got to beat those guys. - Thought I was bananas. - You are. Still want to beat those guys. Come on. - Go get 'em. - You bet. Hey Mose, wait up! Houston can take us over, charge us taxes. When you've been at this for years, we just gotta be in charge of ourselves. - How come I ain't seen you out tryin' to get votes? - I ain't campaigning against no 11 year old kid. - He's out all over town asking people to vote for him. You gotta admire his takin' you on. - Takin' me on? I wish his parents would make him stop this foolishness. He's a nice kid, I don't want to see him get hurt. Come on, Bert, I ain't got all day. - Howdy, I'm Brian Zimmerman. I'm runnin' for mayor of Crabb. - Go play mayor some place else. - No, I'm running to make Crabb its own town. - Get outta here. - You don't understand. I'm really trying to help. - No one's never gonna help no one. - That's not true. - It is around here. Now let me be. - Space shuttle to Houston, beam me up some more nails. - Thought you might be thirsty. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hey, can I get anything to drink? Be right back. - Look at all these people. - Hope they're on our side. - They are. - I really appreciate you taking me here. Come on now, you're a big part of this. Brian really looks up to you. - He's a special child. - Can y'all see? No, but I can hear fine. - Hi, Lima. - Hi, honey. I'm gonna run out of meat paper here if any more voters show up. Nervous? - Yeah. - Good. - Why? - Keeps ya on your toes. Listen up. everybody. Come on now. I wanna welcome to the first election ever held in Crabb. After the speeches, I want you to line up on my right and I'll give you a piece of paper to vote on. We got three fellas who wanna be our first mayor. Lima. - I've got to say something right now. I found out the job of mayor don't pay no money. I'm gonna be pulling out. Anybody's voting for me, just switch over to Vernon. Couldn't be a better mayor and him anyway. Thank you. - Well, all right then. Will the two candidates please come up? Come on now. There you go. Okay, Vernon, you can start. No cussin'. - Thank you. I ain't much on makin' speeches. Y'all all know me. I'm a farmer like most of y'all are. I've been living in Crabb for 30 years. I've seen the droughts and floods and good times and bad times and worried about feeding and clothing the family. But we got through it, and Crabb got through it. We ain't never had a mayor 'cause we didn't need one. And now Brian here says that we not only need one, but that he ought to be it. And I just wish he'd tell us why. - It's true you always get along somehow. That's in the past. I'm worried about the future. If we don't do something now, we'll be swallowed up by Houston. They'll tax us and we won't do anything for years. We might not even be named Crabb anymore. I want us to join together, make our own town, our own future. - That's right. We've got to think about the future. That's why it'd be crazy for us to elect a mayor that'd have to go runnin' to his mama and daddy every time something came up he didn't understand. Don't you do what your mama and daddy tell you to? - Yes, sir. - Well, of course you do. And that's only right. But who'd really be running this town? It'd be Brian's daddy, and we might as well just go ahead and vote for Buster and be done with it. I mean let's face it, we'd be the joke of Texas if we elect an 11 year old mayor. Who'd take us serious? I believe in the youth of America, but doggone, what do they know about raising a family? - Well, so far, all Mr. Matthews has told you is I'm 11 years old. But y'all knew that before ya got here. Hadn't said a word about what he'd do if he was mayor. - Well, I'll tell you what I do. I'd just keep this town running like it's been running for years and years. In fact, if Crabb was a boat, I'd say just don't rock it. - It isn't a boat. This town, it's us. We gotta belong to ourselves, depend on each other. I care about all of us being protected. I want to know that if we need a policemen or doctor, he'd be there. I love this town. If y'all get behind me, I promise I'll make it happen. Thanks. - I'm a nervous wreck. Polls closed at eight o'clock - Well, should be pretty soon now. I hope. I'll get it! - I can't stand this. - Shh. Honey. - You did your best. - I know. I won. - Don't take it too. You won? - I won. - You won? - He won! He won! You did it! - I can't believe it, that's great. - Mayor? - Mayor? - Mayor. - Now, I can see what you mean, but now what exactly is your problem out there? - Dust blowin' in the dry season, knee deep mud in the wet season. We pay county taxes. - Well, I'll have a road crew out there first thing tomorrow. You folks are gonna get a brand new road out there. - That'd be great. Why wasn't it paved before? - Nobody ever asked. So you're not gonna try to get my job from me next year, are ya? - No, I have my hands full with this one. Thanks a lot, Mr. Commissioner. - My pleasure, Mr. Mayor. - All right? - Yeah. So, until Crabb becomes a town and we have our own police, you depend on the county sheriff to send a car kinda when everyone's available. - Yeah yeah, that's the problem. - That's why I'd like for you to donate a couple of cars. - A couple of cars? - And gas. - And gas, too. I suppose you want me to donate some personnel? - No, some of them live in our area. I was hoping they'd volunteer a little off time, drive around a few times a day. - Well, that's a good idea for you, but it doesn't make good business sense for my company. - Mr. Cooper, there's 15 security companies in this area. Crabb has a chance to be the new growing community. If you're willing to help us now, it'd be good publicity for your generosity. Then in the future, when somebody's looking for a good security company, Universal Security is a name they'd recognize. What I'm offering you, it's a ground floor, so to speak. - To make incorporation beneficial, you have to extend the boundaries of Crabb so that there's enough tax potential to get accomplished what you want done. Then you have to take a census of how many people live within them per square mile. That will help you set your tax rate. - Guess we'll have to convince more people to vote for incorporation. - I don't think you're gonna have a problem. Now, normally the cost of petition for incorporation is $2,500, but I won't charge my fee. Thanks. - With paperwork and processing cost, it'll still come to about $500. - Well I'll work things out so we can get started. - You call me whenever you're ready. - You bet. Should have checked into cost before I applied for that incorporation. Crabb doesn't even have a bank account. - You know you can count on us. Your father and I can lend you or Crabb or whoever the money. - I can't do that. It's my own problem. Can't have it lookin' like my family's running things. - What are you gonna do then? - I'll figure something out. - 50, 100, 50, 200, 250. - Thanks. Hope your son likes it. - Sure he will. Thank you. - Man, how could you sell it? - Got better things to do with the money. Hey, we still get our bikes. - Yahoo. - Been sittin' around in the shade all day. I'm gonna put you in the sun. There's your mama in the sun. Get in the sun, you'll bloom like the wildflowers in the field. - Holmes! mayor sneakin' up on us. I used to hear your buggy a mile away. - I'm into bicycles now. Got your root beer. - What happened to your buggy? - Had to sell it. Didn't know it'd cost so much to incorporate. It's gonna be good though. Just take some more time. - How much you need? - About $200. - Just a second. Here, take this down to the truck. - Why-- - Go on, just do it. - Now what? - Near my left front tire. - All right. - Dig down beside it. - How come. - Just do what I say. This is crazy. - Keep diggin'. - There's a tin box. - Bring it here. - What is it? - Open it up. Take what you need. - Where'd you get this? - Savings. - I can't touch this. - Now don't give me that. I believe in you, boy. I want to be a part of it. - You are. - It's my needs. I do with it what I want. Take it. - Can I have your attention, please? Welcome to our first town meeting. We're gonna vote on incorporation, put into law the no age limit for mayor. Means the mayor can be be long in tooth and short in choppers. Don't want to discriminate against anybody. First order of business is the no age limit. Floor's open for anybody who wants to express an opinion. - I got an opinion. - Mr. Matthews? - I got a lot of respect for Brian and all the things he's been doing around here. I really do. And I think one of these days he's gonna make a real fine mayor, but not now, not today. Y'all realize that if we incorporate, it's gonna mean paying taxes that's gonna be handled by Brian. I'd rather see Houston take us in, have good solid leadership. To end up being the laughingstock of Texas, I say we ought to stop this foolishness right now or we're gonna all end up gettin' hurt later on. Thank you. - Anybody else want to say anything? Okay then, let's put it to the test. We use voice votin'. All those in favor, say aye. Aye. - All those opposed, say nay. The ayes have it. No age limits passed. Now we gotta vote on incorporation. Start off, we have to have 100 signatures on this here petition. After Richmond County approves it, we'll have a final vote here in Crabb. Y'all vote yes, we'll be an official town. Floor's open for discussion. If there's no discussion, let's put it to the test. All those in favor of starting the incorporation procedure. Aye! Those opposed. Motion is carried. Anybody want to sign the petition? - Gotta get another buggy. - All in good time, Mose. - You sure we can't get away with 80 names? - It's gotta be 100. Now come on! - Hey, wait up. - Hey Holmes, mayor's got your brew. Holmes? Holmes? Holmes! - I don't feel good. - I gotta get help. Mighty nice field of wheat you got here. - Yeah, I'm just trying to get finished before the rain starts. - Dad always said it was hard work. Can I talk to you about something? - Go ahead. - I know how you feel about me. - Ain't nothin' personal, son. - I know that. I got the petition here. I'm turning it into Richmond tomorrow. It's got 99 names on it. I'd like for you to be 100. - You don't need my name. - I do. I need your help. I'll try to incorporate this town with or without you. It'll be a lot better if you stand behind it, for the good of Crabb. - For the good of Crabb, I just can't be part of this foolishness. Look, everybody thinks it's real cute you bein' mayor and all, and I respect you for trying, but incorporation means taxes. I just can't put that responsibility in a kids' hands. - I plan to put a city council together and work as a team. - I just can't support that. - Sorry you feel that way. I'll get the last name and do the best I can. - You do that, Brian, but I'm gonna fight you on this thing. - I guess we both got a lot of work to do. - I reckon so. I'll see you, son. - Countin's finished for the vote on incorporation. 625 ballots were cast. The count is to 30. 595 citizens have voted not to incorporate. People need a place where they can go and think and get answers. - Hey, Brian. Be right back, Mom. Try not to feel too bad. - I feel fine. - Gotta take the losin' with the winnin' - I didn't lose. You saw the turnout. Over 600 people came out. - Yeah, to vote against you. - But they voted, and they will again. - What again? - Mr. Matthews scared 'em about taxes. I didn't get to them. They didn't understand what I was trying to do. - So you lost. - No, I didn't. I'm still mayor. I'll make it happen. I'm not gonna give up. You'll see. - Hey, I'm a believer. Come on. - Hey, wait up. - We're gonna go down proud, Mose. City hall should be right there, a two story building. And there'll be a big council room where town meetings will be held. And over there'll be a fire department with the police next door. And I'll get shop owners to paint their stores so folks'll wanna shop here. It's gonna be great, Mose. I can see the whole thing. Yeah, slow down please. Please slow down. - No, come on!
