Let's run away From the one that binds you Cross the border Let's repaint Love, peace and freedom Ideas and charms are weapons You can be stupid Strike with all your heart Let's keep the air open We are New map My name is Goro. Please wait a moment. Wait a bit longer. I will tell you my story now. Don't shoot the pianist! It all started with something that I did. That girl is running because of that. Because of that, she is beeing chased by men. She is going to the main street, heading to the festival. Goro! Goro! Wait, wait! Are you ok? Wait! My heart made a decision. I am prepared. Hurry up Daimon-san, Fujiko is in trouble! Daimon-san, please hurry up! Fujiko. Fujiko. Fujiko. Fujiko.. Fujiko.. Fujiko, ... Good-bye, until we meet again. Fujiko. Fujiko. This man is known as Daimon. This morning, his beloved Fujiko run away which gave him a bad mood. Fujiko. What happened? Why are you here? I am Fujiko! Can you cover me? You can hide here. Don't worry, it's safe to hide here. Daimon got so depressed Like no one has ever seen. I will destroy this room! Daimon's hability to smell is like a dog. It's said to be 100 million times better than the average human. Nah, it's just an evil rumour. All Daimon can do now is run. It's all my fault, it's all because of me. Kudo-san we are big trouble, wait! -What the fuck is wrong with you? -Did you see a girl? Just go in that direction. It's safe now. Thank you! -Good luck! -Fighting! Will you keep running? It's better to go this way because the men that way. Over there! Fujiko? Are you after a girl? She run in that direction! I don't need your help! -You don't have to be in a rush. -Are you Goro's friend? Fujiko! Who I am? I will explain later. Let's move on. I love you! -Instead, I will introduce this lovely girl Fujiko. -I love you! I love you! This girl is coming for me. This girl is coming for me. Fujiko! Daimon-san! Fujiko (...) -Daimon-san! -I will kill you! Ok, just kill me. I am ready at any moment. Are you ok? It hurts! Now you can feel the pain again, right? This person is Joe. He used to be a professional boxer. Right after becoming a professional, his weakness was revelead. As he finished punching his opponent, he looked into his eyes and felt his pain. He felt pity for him as he looked at him. That's the reason for him to be here now. Fujiko, good luck! Keep running! Beethoven's masterpiece. Now, it's time to talk about me. That day, I met Fujiko. As usual, we were outside and I was caressing a marmot. What a nice way to caress it. So beautiful. -Your fingers! -I am a pianist. As a pianist, I feel lucky for doing this from my heart. What are you doing? Let's go! Don't mind me, I want to go to the library. -Can you please just go. -Are you going to to the library? Why? I want something to read that I can't find in a bookstore. I will give you this now in case you are interested in me. Agree. What's wrong with that guy? What? How? -Do you want to be my girlfriend? -Okay! What the fuck? -Wait! -What does it mean? Do you have any objection? -No! -Let's continue. Do you have something to say? Nothing. If you get noisy, I will cut you right away. Since then, I've been seeing other women to forget about Fujiko. One after another. This is the best thing to do. What? In "No Longer Human" by Osamu Dazai I think that the content in this book doesn't apply only to the past, it still applies in modern Japan. Goro, what do you think about Mount Fuji (Fujisan)? -Fujiko? -Fujisan (Mount Fuji). Fujiko! Weird. Fujiko! Why? From that day.. I feel stupid! A complete idiot. I can't get you out of my head. Everyday... ...I think about you. Why? Shit. I always think about her. Wow, this cell is beautiful! This woman is the perfect woman and she's a scientist There's no other woman like her. This cell belongs to every human beeing. This is what makes us familiar (Fujimi) Fujiko? -Fujimi (familiar). -Fujiko.. Sorry, there is someone that I like. -Can you please leave? -Wait! What happened? I found the firework that Fujiko gave me and set it up. After that Fujiko. I love you! Fujiko. I love you. I love you. Now I am here. I love you. We need to leave soon. We need to leave soon! I love you. I love you... Fujiko. Fujiko. "Run, Melos!" "Run, Melos!" "Run, Melos!" Everyone has their own scent. He could find her anywhere in Japan just by following her scent. It's just a matter of time until he finds her. Amazing! I knew you were a genious. You have such beautiful fingers. Your fingers make me feel so horny... but I love them! Daimon's hability to smell is said to be 100 million times better than the average person. He will find Fujiko easily. I am flirting thinking like an idiot. That idiot is me. I will kill you. -Let's talk for a moment. -Eh? By the way, what did you do to my Fujiko? I was treating Fujiko's body like a piano. Piano? That person is Fujiko. At first I touched her eyelids and lips gently with my fingertips. Like I was playing Beethoven. Bastard... Bastard! (...) (...) Shit! I will not forgive you. You must destroy his fingers. Do it! Motherfuuuuuucker!
