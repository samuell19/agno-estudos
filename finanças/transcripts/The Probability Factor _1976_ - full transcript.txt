I do remember perfectly the morning that I knew I was going to kill my wife. It's weird because it was a morning just like any other. Only I was different. To kill Gloria I've wanted this since several months, even years maybe. But I didn't know. And then that day when I woke up I knew... Are you still in bed? But it's time to wake up It's time to go to work. Think of your future, get going. Yes, yes... yes Gloria! - Come on get up. I knew I was going to kill her. So, I was very calm. I don't know why we let this animal sleep in the house. This place is not for animal. It's unhealthy For him and for us. Nature didn't create animals to live at home. Here. Can I get a coffee for once? No way. Don't bother, I'll do it myself. Don't you dare Fred. Why? Coffee makes you anxious, you know that. But Gloria, I'm very calm. A stressful day that awaits you Fred. But Gloria But stay calm! It's milk you must drink, you know. I want milk but with little coffee. You know the effect of milk, in contact with coffee in the stomach? Milk produces big lumps! Lumps, anyway! Yes Gloria, right Gloria. And eat your soy milk porridge. Ok Gloria. What you want to do this evening, my dear? Why can't we just go out for dinner at a restaurant? Romantic. No? OK. Fred. Yes. Your pills. One every three hours, don't forget. It stimulates the intellect. Because you need it. Mr. Malone, I didn't hear you come in. I was looking for... Here's one, a pen. Wish you a very nice day, Mr. Malone. Something wrong Mr. Malone? No, not at all, thank you. I didn't say hello to you, hello. Hello Mr. Malone. Since how long have you been my secretary Miss Howell. What? Oh, right! Five and Six... That makes eleven. For eleven months. It's almost my anniversary. Right. I hope you're all satisfied. Very satisfied, thank you. Satisfied of what? Of me... of my work Mr. Malone. Oh yes, you're doing well, thank you. Very well. Nothing to complain about, it's perfect. Miss Howell, will you please sit down. Take a notebook, Memo. Remember that our form 6621 has to be completed in full, if we want the ranking system of our computer to be effective. Lately... What do you have for breakfast? Excuse me? - Nothing! Lately, some forms 6621 returned incomplete. Butter Brioche and chocolate cream. My breakfast. They returned incomplete. Period. I must insist once gain... I must insist... It looks good on you. Not good for your body line I don't care. ...insist once again... So that all client representatives fill this form entirely in the interest of all of us, and especially of the customer. ...and especially of the customer... If the forms are incomplete... our service is required to contact the customer, which is a waste of time. ...of time... Do you have your breakfast in bed? Of course. That's how I pictured it. Not only this will irritate the customer and the staff of our service. But, also in addition the procedure is expensive. ...is expensive... That's all. My wife makes for me soy porridge. Every morning for breakfast. It's very bad. Ah, yes sir. Have you already eaten it?. By no means, I take brioche. This is exactly what I need. Excuse me sir? Your brioche. My brioche, anyway... Brioches, you know... Are you sure you're feeling OK this morning? Very very well, thank you. The memo, make copies for... Andruet, Delouette, Canceil and Choukroun. What amuses you? Do I have something on my face? Sorry sir, I was thinking of Mr. Andruet. What's with Andruet? No, it's much too personal. But that's ok, ok, I don't want to interfere in your private life. It's nothing like that sir. It's ok, ok. I don't want to know. Simply he makes me laugh. He's always complaining about his wife, right? I don't know, I don't know him...intimately. Ah...me neither but... All the men I meet have terrible spouses, and they talk about it all the time, it's annoying. As I said I can't refuse all the lunch invitations. Naturally... Or a dinner. A dinner. A dinner? Tonight? George. What will you have for a start? Well... A cocktail... An Alexandra. No, it's too complicated. You see, I can't drink something treacherous. Well, a little Porto. Two fingers of Porto. No, I'm too thirsty. A big champagne cocktail. You will love this. A Martini-Gin. Two Martini-Gin George. Yes Sir. You like simple things, this is good. I appreciate this. It depends! It depends on... It depends on... It depends on the circumstances. For example, novels... I like them complicated Many things happening to the characters. Just like in real life, right. Ah no, more. Ah, even more. Thank you George. However, life is complicated, you know, it's even complex. Yes, Mr. Malone. For example, we both are here. We drink, 2 Martini-Gin It's complicated. It's even complex. You see what I mean? Yes, now that you tell me that. You see, most men invites me for a drink have hidden thoughts. Really? Are you... a gentleman, you understand? No. You're normal, right? Certainly. However you don't make the first step to me. There you go... This is why? The complexity. Ah..Ah...Yes Don't you want us sit down to table? So, we exchange ideas while we eat. I don't think I'll eat I drank too much, I'm dizzy. Really? but... Mr. Malone, can you follow me to my home? You understand, if I ever get in an accident! The bill. If you follow me. - Yes That's it. Lean on me. Lean on me. You can come upstairs! I'm coming. Your tie's too tight. No, pull if you want. ...Miss Howell. - Oh, yes Miss Howell. Yes Fred. But, Miss Howell. What are you doing, Miss Howell? But, don't do this, well, Miss Howell. But, Miss Howell. What are you doing? - The effect you are doing on me. Do you know what you are doing to me since 11 months? Fred! - But I didn't know. Fred... I didn't know. I would have paid more attention to what I was doing if I wasn't deeply worried by the problem of the method. Strangulation, throat cutting, cremation. I decided to be ruthless. I was going perhaps to smash her thick head under my avenging heel. This is the time you come home? I'm a little late! I'm sorry, An administrator came at the last second He put me to work! Seriously I couldn't leave him. Keep quiet. Ah, is it like that? You keep me from watching my television. You know what I'll do? You know what I'll do? I will ask you a divorce. Deactivate demolition charges.. Anyway, If this keeps up! Be quiet, and eat your liver. Yes Gloria. All that's left of Lt. Masters... Miss Jones. Regrettably, He is completely burnt. One thing clearly emerges from Malone's statistics. Almost 20% of males with life insurance who passed away in the past two years, died of heart attacks. Every one noticed it Mr Choukroun. Perhaps we should impose more advanced and stricter medical exams. Attention, attention, if we are too demanding customers will go to other companies! That wouldn't be a bad thing. Say, Malone, instead of sharing candies to your colleagues you might very well participate too, we never hear from you. Sir... I know you introduce to us in great detail the results of your informatics service. But apart from numbers, no one is there! Ah, Mr. actually... - Actually what? Actually, maybe we can discover the sum of by calculation, the risks of heart attack. And I could, with the help of statistics, to find out if there are not two or three common factors, the same for every deceased? This way if an eventual client with identical factors comes we would deny the right of insurance. That's a basic play, he's not dumb Malone Mr. Delouette, I'm not allowing you to introduce here an atmosphere of rudeness and indolence. It's science fiction Malone! Foreseeing death with a computer! I don't know sir, but... Clearly, we'd need a very detailed questionnaire. For example, we know that alcohol and tobacco determine a particular type of accident. So, all and all, if we get to know the... the, the habits of an individual We can accurately calculate the cause of his death. What did you say Malone? what did he say? God's sake, here is the method. All an all, if we get.... All and all, if we get to know the habits of an individual We can exactly predict his risk of death. God's sake, here is the method. Be polite, miss. Miss, would you get me the figures on the mortality of women 35-45 years of age, please. Do you know where did I put my HP 65? My HP 65, do you know where I put it? We will have our own terminal Miss Howell. But to record the data in the field, nothing like my small device. We will start a new program. It was great. It was great Fred. Yes, yes. Miss Howell. At the office would you mind calling me Mr. Malone? It was great, Mr. Malone. You are coming home later and later. What's with your shirt? Oh, the small buttons, buttons got out. Sounded like you are having a great fun! - No, no. In that case, I'll take my bath. Good. Tell me, did you watch the TV tonight? Of course. From what time to what time? From 8:30pm until the end. As usual. TV...? Because my hairdryer has a loose connection. You're going to repair it. Hairdryer...! It can be dangerous, the hairdryer. Here it is, I brought you the accidents in the bathroom, fatal falls, boiler explosions. Also gas asphyxiations, no suicide. Do you know that I am like the Marquis de Sade, Miss. Howell? Excuse me! Yes, he liked numbers, I like numbers. Like the Marquis de Sade the great writer. The poor man. What do you mean, poor man? He lived in a prison all his life, that's boring, right? Is that so? That's not nice. That is sad. Well, she has all the chances to get an accident in the bath. And if the bath mat is removed, risk increases. Yes. Fred. Yes, my dear. Fred, what the hell you are doing in there? I want to take my bath. Okay Gloria, Immediately Gloria. Why are you looking at me lustfully? Good luck Gloria. So Malone. Look tired! You work too much, my friend. At least your thing is working? No. Don't make that face. You know what you need. Not enough alcohol, not enough women. Lighten up Malone. We need to laugh. Safety handle defective, risk 18. Fatty bodies... and, what else? Fatty bodies, what does it mean? What does it mean. Bath Oil = Fatty Bodies Fred. What's this thing? A safety handle, it's to hold on it while leaving the bath To avoid slipping. Try it, it's very solid, it supports up to 150 kg. You're saying I'm very heavy? No, not at all, my dear, absolutely not. No, it's for me, you know. It's true, I'm a little overweight currently, I... It's normal with all delicious meals you make for me. And my kidneys are larger. You ruined all the wall. - Me? Oh, maybe just a little It's not my fault, it's this drill bit, I have a slippery drill bit, refuses... Done. Get out, let me take my bath. Yes my dear. Take your bath. I have for you... I have a small gift for you. Ah, what again? It's a bath oil. What is this? But, there is no price! It cost me nothing. It's a gift from one of our representatives who made to sign a... a big insurance contract by a company of beauty products. And they gave him this. So he gave it to me, and I give it to you. Me, I don't use bath oil. It's a pity, because it, it, it cleanses the skin. It's smooth and slippery, and soft, and smooth, smooth. My skin, is very good as it is. It smells bad and I'll not use it. Ah, that's pity you don't like this, you see, he gave me a whole box. And it's worth a fortune, these things. How come? - Well, I won't force you If you don't like this. Don't force yourself my dear, don't force. I live them here for you, and then... then, you don't use it if you don't want to. Damn, I blew it again. Although, I did everything the computer told me The mat, the handle, the oil She was using everything and it failed. A factor was missing. A factor is missing. Maybe they didn't pay attention. Are you out of your mind? You mumble all the time for 15 days now. I find it exasperating. Are you happy now? Happy, why happy, it's not my fault! No, but you mumble all the time. That gets on my nerve, and when... when I'm mad, I make a mess, see. That's the factor! What factor? A factor? But no, the factor, the factor... The factor I was looking for. Emotion, irritation. Irritation, that's the factor. Are you crazy, what? I was just pulling your leg there... I forbid you to make jokes. I forbid you coming in with noises. But I made noises. What's the matter with you, coming back home so early. My TV! What's wrong with? They are on strike, I believe so. On strike? my TV! On strike? But what am I going to do now? Come, eat your liver. Come, eat your liver. Come, eat your liver. It's delicious, It'll do you good. It'll do you good, come. Come. I don't want this junk food. You hear me? You really seem awfully nervous. A little tired, maybe. Here's what I want you to do. While I eat this delicious red liver cooked rare. You'll take a hot bath. And then... When you are all clean and scented, I'll join you. If you touch me, I'll kill you Fred. She'll start screaming now. She's getting mad. Fred the phone. She is calling me. She is furious. Fred! She'll move now... She'll go. She grabs the handle. She wants to get dressed, too quickly her foot slips in the oil bath. She wants to grab the handle, the handle detaches She falls, her head... She is bleeding... It'll last 15 minutes until the blood drains out. That's it now. - Hello, yes? Gloria? Who is it? It's me. What do you want? Why do you call? I'm calling from a phone booth. Yes, I went out to see if... I...I wanted to buy razor blades So I wanted to ask you if you need anything. No, I don't need anything, I was in my bath. Excuse me Gloria. Beat it, I'll go back to my bath. That's it, go back. Bloody hell. Gloria. Gloria. Gloria. Behold, this time you're dead. Bitch. And now help! Help! Help. Help. Help. My wife had an accident. My wife had an accident. Seven... Emergency services. We're going to constitute with precision what happened. I do not want to bore you with it. Yes, yes, tell me please. I still don't believe it! She entered her bathtub too abruptly. Her heel slipped in the bath oil. She held on the security handle. The handle came off. So the head... She didn't suffer. It's sad, twist of fate. Condolences. - Thank you. Sorry for your loss. Thank you sir. Condolences, man. Condolences Malone. Hold the line, thank you sir. If you want to take few days? My poor, two days! Oh, no, thank you, but I'd rather continue, nothing changed. How brave Malone, How brave! You are an inspiration. Tell me The unfortunate was insured, I believe. - Yes. I'll get things activated so that you'll get the money. I Know, it sounds quite derisory. A few million will not fill this kind of void. Absolutely, of course. Now, I'll leave you, Malone. OK. - Thank you. Courage, mate! Courage. Thank you. So where were we. Ah the motorcycle, I want it green. You have green ones? ...You... Yes, I want you to get it delivered to me. Ah, wait, I'll call you back on that one, because I'll change my address. I'm moving out. How sad... I'll call you back! It's so unfortunate... Yes. Yes, yes. Certainly, it took courage. Obviously, the first day was very hard for me. Come. You've been... You are Miss Howell, a great comfort. Yes, yes, it's true your behavior was so dignified. You know Charlotte, grief is a strange thing. Yes. At first, we want to die too. Then gradually, we feel rising in ourselves... the desire to live. To live Charlotte, to live - Stop. You know, I admire you Malone. There's nothing to it really. Ah, yes, yes, yes. We all felt that you were devastated, and at the same we saw a big burst in you. Like a flood of ebullient energy, this is admirable. Ah, you felt this? Yea, definitely. It's not usual. Its true, maybe I'm gifted with a courage exceptional But, you see... It's that, it's no merit. It's unconscious. But you're right, it's a thing that is not given to everyone, but, anyway, still you know it's unclear how we'll react to this kind of shock. May I? No, but I know. Really? No, no, don't make that face. No, no,no... If your wife were to die, then you'll know it. But what do you mean... It's very simple. My wife is a monster. You too! But...Delouette, Delouette... Why don't you get rid of her? A divorce? It's impossible. Ah yes, this, this is a determining element. No, but I don't get to pieces! Lighten up Malone. We need to laugh. Tell me. - Yes. When you finish here. A little cognac, what do you say? They don't have it here. They, no, but me! Take it! - Seems like you found another one. I should stop drinking, I'm so sad. Why so Fred? All you tell me about your wife! Oh, the bitch. You know what she does to me? She's always irreproachable, perfect, the house is perfect, just to humiliate me. It's terrible. Just to humiliate me. Always ironing my shirts Making the food for me. That is atrocious, what you're saying. You must react Pierre. There's nothing I can do. But no, don't say this. Oh yes. - But no... But no, nothing can be done, it's hopeless. But Pierre, don't say this. But anything can happen. I don't believe it. - But yes! Are you my friend? Ah, I'm your friend Fred. And me, am I your friend Pierre? But you're my friend Fred. You don't seem convinced of what you are saying. Ah but I'm your friend, for heaven sake. Then, invite me over for a dinner tonight at your house. You still have time to run away. No, no, I must observe her. You have to make the effort then! Because physically, she's not hot. Only if you like fat redhead beast! Here, I bring you a friend, it's Fred. Good evening Fred. Good evening Madam. What did I tell you. You don't feel like finishing your plate, Fred? It's disgusting. Ah, it looks like it. The sauces she makes for me. Afterwards, my liver is demolished. Don't you think she could make me occasionally a small slice of ham, something light with fries, right? Always roux, white butters, Bechamels! Stuffings, some... some things from Perigord, Normandy. Quails with Grapes, see, you can imagine! The bitch. And now, for breakfast what do you have? For breakfast! Heavy things. Soybeans? Soybeans, who is mentioning soybeans? Horrible stuff. A little salad Fred? You won't make us still eat your salad. No, don't let walk her over you Fred. I know this salad. Full of oil, of bacon, of nasty stuffs. By the way, I'm going to serve you some little anchovies. Anchovies, then without me. Not me, no, because I'm already full. Already, I do not feel well. Quails with raisin, I'm fed up, if you ask me. Ah, look. Ah, my carpet. Don't strain yourself, Fred, You know, I'm used to it. It's awful. Oh no, it's normal. You know, this happen often. Help me, to place him in the arm chair Yes, certainly, certainly. Leave me Fred, leave me Fred. I'll put him to sleep and give him medicines. And then I'll be back. - Slowly. Continue to eat, if you like to. No, it took away my appetite. Right, I see. Listen, go to the living room, anyway. Make yourself a drink, something like that, I'll be back in 5 minutes. You don't think, I better... No, no, go ahead, go ahead. In 5 minutes I'll make you a good coffee. Here's your coffee Fred. I hope I didn't keep you waiting for long. You know I waited for him to sleep. He was struggling, it was awful. Ah, yes. Are you sure you don't want a desert. No really, thank you. Ah, what a pity, I made profiteroles. You don't like it. - I love profiteroles. But really no, thank you. That's fine, you can take-away. I have a heatproof box, that'll do. How many cubes? One. You are very well organized. You know Fred, it's a must in a house when there is a man. You'll take a little more cognac? yes, I'd like to. Ah, I have very good Havana cigars if you like to. Yes? - Yes. I'll prepare it for you. Is it good? It's horrible. No, excuse me, it's not what I meant, but... It's awful. - Ah Fred, You're very kind You're worried about Pierre, is it? But no, no, I'm not nice, really not... I...Well, yes, I'm very kind. But... and... Louise, let me make a confession. Here... I never imagined you absolutely... I never imagined you absolutely as you are. Ah really?

You're sensitive, you're good. It's true you're tender. You are beautiful. You are really beautiful Louise. You're ideal woman Louise. Ah the pig. Excuse me! Pierre your husband. The pig. But... But there's no reason really, There's no reason, I don't see why.. I keep for a pig like this a promise I've never even made. So, then. Don't you mind I call him pig? You love him maybe? No. Still, he's a companion in good and bad days. What are you saying? Oh, nothing. - Ah, you don't love him! No, besides how can you love him, it's true. He is a being, a being awful, despicable. He's fat. Crude. He's drunk. You see his behaviour at the table. He's not even intelligent, you see. Not intelligent at all. He's an idiot, an idiot. We call him, this idiot Delouette. No, and also he is... he is vulgar, he is a brute. While you, You, you, you are... you are a little fragile being. Ah no, not at all. But yes Louise, but yes, but yes, but yes. He beats you, I bet. This, sometime he tries to. See, Fred... Just yesterday, I was forced to punch him in the face. No! Poor small child abused. But it's to you I should have made this promise. Actually, I'll make it, I'll make it to you. I'll promise you Louise. He'll disappear from your life this bastard. Ah no, not this Fred. Ah, but yes. But no Fred, after all... Let's not spoil the beginning of a friendship that starts well. You're so good. - But no. - Very understanding. No, I'm not good Louise, I'm... I'm a big human beast. Yes, you suddenly enter into my life. Like a beast Louise, like a beast. Like a beast in the jungle. Yes, so it's normal that I'd be completely panicked, no? But no Louise, no, but no, no... Understand me. Listen to me Fred. I can't. This will kill him. This will kill him? Yes, yes. This will kill him, you know. Yes. - His heart. What about his heart? But his heart, haven't you heard?

Lucky Delouette What he has to do with this, this drunkard. The cocktail miracle. The product, the recipe It's Delouette. Lucky Delouette, go. Poor Delouette. Why poor Delouette. It's because, I don't know if you see what I mean. My enthusiastic questions about Delouette. The cocktail, he does not really need it so much. Delouette. Good old Delouette. Oh, yes, yes, yes, she's crazy about you. She said to me: Mr. Malone, this guy, I'm crazy about him. Crazy about him. - Really? Yes, yes? - Yes, yes. You're very nice Malone. So what is this? Latest thing that Delouette taught me. It's amazing, it will turn women totally crazy. Really? Try this one. What now, in the office? Yes, it's much more exciting. Oh, Mr. Malone. And here is the bra. - Yes. Yes, yes. - You attach it. Pass the thing around the hip. Around the hip. Some guy Delouette. This one! What a guy this Delouette... - This one?. Yes, yes. - Like this?

I have a knife in my pocket, can you reach it. Some guy, Delouette. Oh Mr. Malone. She does things to you. Most women have no idea of it. Right? You have no idea, she's a real bitch. No, what I'm telling you by the way it's... I simply repeat what I heard. But... Don't encourage her too much, she might rape you right away. Here... - No! Yes... Too bad, with all the work you have, I would have lent her to you tonight to help you. Yes, yes, yes Yes. It's not possible. - Why? Oh come on Pierre. You don't consider... I'm a match for anything. Miss. Mr. Malone. Mr. Delouette, just left here. He has big delays regarding his files. And we were asking ourselves whether if you'd agree to help him tonight. Mr. Delouette? - Yes. Now, tonight. - Yes tonight. But, I... As you wish Mr. Malone. Anyway, I don't need you Miss. Howell. I'm going home. I have a headache. Don't get too tired Miss. Howell. Have a good evening. The bastard, bastard. Leave me bastard. What a bastard. She screamed your name, that's why we called you. Thank you very much. Please Mr. Malone, for Europe. I can't imagine what might have happened, Mr. Delouette has been a model employee. He was an admirable husband. A man with high moral standing even. As for my secretary Miss. Howell, she is a young woman, charming, discreet, reserved. Puritan even. I don't understand it, really, I don't get it, no. Well, come on, Malone. It's your secretary. Didn't you notice that they were flirting? That looks bad. Anyway, bravo for your statement Very good, very honorable. I improvised, sir. We have to get rid of this bitch. Understood, our house is a clean house. I'm on it. 15 days of notice, and... Two months sir. Two months of salary, this bitch. Excuse me. It's a gesture we are making. Let's say, and, and the widow? I had the opportunity to meet her. It's my intention to personally visit the unfortunate. Bravo Malone. Your responsible attitude appeals to me. Carry on like this, and you have a bright future with us. Thank you sir. I use this opportunity to allow myself to point out to you that this sordid story would not have happened if we knew our employees better. Also, I propose to reorganize our IT department under single authority. The wine you brought it's amazing. You want me to get drunk, Fred? Oh, not at all, at all. It's just I come so often to you. So I thought to bring something to you. Thank you Fred. For coming so often. I don't want to be a hypocrite. I can't say that I miss Pierre. No? - No. No. But you understand. I need a presence in the house. I like to take care of man. Really? This also I think you have understood. - Yes. Yes the heat of the oven, the noise of the washing machine, the pleasure to iron a collar. I don't know that. I don't know. Maybe I compensate. That you compensate what? But I don't know Fred. Any frustration! Really? A frustration! Yes... In fact, I was... - Naughty! I wondered how you'll get to the point. Me too. More? -Yes. Gladly. Ok. I'll go up first, ok. - Where? Ah no Fred, you earned it. No, but, you know, we can... You can play music if you want. We can wait till we finish eating. You don't say! Not bad, eh! Well. But you undress yourself? Yes. You don't? See, any way you like. Don't risk catching cold. Catch cold? Yes, catch angina, or something like that no? All naked like this. Don't look so stunned. I'm getting undressed. But I don't know, it's... Any way you like, it's for you Louise. It's better for everyone. Any way, you take the responsibility, no? Ah, yes, I take the responsibility, don't worry. I take the responsibility. But don't worry, You won't be disappointed at all. Get off me Fred. There's no point, you know. Don't try to talk. You are crazy Get off me, my cake is burning. It's totally puerile Fred. You keep on like that. I won't worry. I'll catch cold, with the naked thingy. ??? It narrowly escaped burning with your stubbornness. You hit me. Come on Fred, a small punch, it's nothing. Even so, we're getting on. We can't get along like this, you know. Anyway, when it fails, it fails. Besides, it's not your fault, it's mine. Everyone has their specialty. Like this. But, I don't admit defeat dear Louise. But no, dear Fred, of course. A big or a small. Go away. It's me Fred. It's very ashamed! But don't, I'm not blaming you, I don't. It's me, I don't want to see you. Especially you. Now! now! Miss Howell, we have to... We have to help you to carry this burden. You better pull yourself together. I don't know what happened to me Fred. I'm not, I'm not that kind of girl. But I know Charlotte, I know well. It's a kind of bad luck. Yes, also, I don't know what will happen to me now. I don't know what I'm going to do. Do you have family in the Provence? Ah no! Go to them! Change of scenery. I don't know, try, to, to, try to find work there. Your are good Fred. Oh Fred. Oh, you're kind. - But, no, but no, it's quite natural. But, don't touch me. But my child, I try to, to comfort you. I try to make you forget. No. Forget, I can never forget, Fred. No. I never want to see a man again. Don't give me that nonsense Charlotte. Oh, come on... You are young But no. But you mustn't stop living a life, because a man loved you too much. No. It's true, it's, it's, it's, it's like a horse accident, this. One must... on the contrary, one must start riding again, right away. Nooo!! But, you're crazy, no! You're insane. But you don't know how I feel? But I understand. -No, you have no idea. You think people are robots. But you're a maniac, Mr. Malone. You're sick in the head Mr. Malone. Even so, it's not that serious? I don't admit defeat. You already told me that Fred. You see Louise, the problem is, they were harsh with you. I'll teach you softness. The magic of the flesh. Poetry. That's it, that's it. Your flaming, unrelenting breast intoxicates and presses closer. Your vivid flesh drunkenness released a strangely scented It has your flesh the somber charm, Of summer ripeness It has, your flesh, the somber charms. Your voice... It's very nice, this But it's a little confusing. It's the poem. Ah, it's the poem. Ah, I had a feeling. Does it turn you on?. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, it's exciting. It turns me on always the poetry. Caressing the nipple for a long time it dilates. Well... Then... So you see now.. now if I caress the nipple it dilates. Well, it should get dilated. Because it's erogenous zone. And the... No, the areola, not the halo The areola also. What does... Can I speak informally to you? Yes What do, what do... do you feel, do you feel, there? Yes. What are you thinking about? I think tomorrow you bring me your shirt. Laundry day. No, I mean, as sensation what do you feel here? Do you feel anything? Not sure. There wouldn't be an opened window somewhere, no? What is it? It's me Fred. Who are you? Louise. Tell me Fred. I came to tell you tonight no wine. No wine, no poetry, nothing. Ah, yes, It was not my intention I wanted to tell you, I'm giving up Louise. But Fred, is a very wise idea. Oh, come on! don't make that face, We still have the gastronomy, no? Yes. Moreover we are friends. Friends, friends, yes. About gastronomy Fred. I have to leave you for few days. I'm going to Orléans to see my sister who broke her leg, actually. I have to stay a while, to help her in the house. Anyway, you see, I came to notify you. But Fred, promise me. to be careful about what you'll eat. Yes. Anything I can do for you? Can I take you to the station? Ah, no, no, thank you, I have a taxi waiting for me downstairs. About the transport, Fred. Also, very careful with cars! This week, in your horoscope It says, traffic danger, all this stuff. Ok, well... Goodbye, big lug. Goodbye. Darling, Big lug! Horoscope, right! I saw everything. I saw everything, I saw everything. Do you find it funny? - It's not my mistake. Her Sir, me, I saw it all. I saw what she did, it's her fault, It's the fault of this small woman. - Not true, no way! What's all these lies!!! -If you had stopped at the light... I have a motorcycle also, but I don't use it. Because statistically, we kill ourselves more on two wheels. So I don't see, why to take the risk. You understand, it's mathematical. Yes. Yes, I'm a little shy employee. And yet, And yet, Not only that, you know. No, no, no. No, how do you know? If we consider you from a point of view disillusioned. Yes. You seem like completely wretched and idiot. What makes you say that. All, the car, the tie, all that is to be put aside. No, not at all, not at all. But yes, absolutely. All of these must be changed. Must be! Ought to. My French is guilty sometime. ought to, will have to, will have to, must not... Me I find it all to the good, I'm fine. So, I'm happy as I am. I don't see why, I...? Because, I want to hang out with you. Oh, yeah! What are you saying? Tomorrow I go to Rome, and I'm back on Saturday. So, we have a date? But how? But why? You have misunderstood what just happened. I'm not sure what you mean. Did...did something happen? Between us. A car accident. A collision. Car! No my friend. Existential. What, what are you telling me, what's it to me, this story? You're really in love. And I desire you. I'm not sure if I can wait till Saturday. So then... - But... On the 23rd, at 9:30pm at your place? You're completely crazy. The adventure my little guy! I'm not your little guy. You have to have fun, honey! Fun, fun, me I don't want to have fun. What time did you say anyway, the 23rd, what time? French champagne, my dear Virginia. Oh yes. Absolutely, indeed. Hello. - Hello! What a nice surprise. So, tell me Fred, are you waiting for someone? You're dressed like a prince. -Ah, no, no, no. Your sister is already healed! I'm delighted, I'm pleased, I exult. Tell me Fred. All this vegetation smells toxic. It's small your place. You don't like my small nest? Ah, me you know I like houses. I like big houses. You're right Louise, you're right. At most, obviously, an apartment for a single can be conceivable. Although, but, tell me Fred, - Yes. You are waiting for someone, I see two plates! My God, it's true. It's true what you say, see. It's kind of ceremony. Yes, yes, it's because of a regiment buddy, you see. We used to have dinner together every evening. and then we swore, if I come back or him We do... for the anniversary of his death, you see. And then, yes, oh! yes, and oh! yes... The poor guy, the Germans got him. The Germans? Yes, yes. You said the Germans, Fred? But how old are you? I said, the Germans, me? How stupid I am! No, I meant the fellaghas, the viets. I don't why I'm telling you all about it Louise. So, how can I help you? Oh yes, Fred. I need a Bloody Mary. So tell me you come from the military world That is so exciting. Ah, no, no, it's not a big thing. You said a Bloody Mary, yes, right away. Also, Louise, hurry up, please, because. My evening is very busy. Realise that, this ceremony, all this, I need to focus, I need to... I need to gather myself, you see and all of that... And all these beautiful flowers, Fred. It's also for this buddy regiment. Oh yes, yes, yes, you guessed it, yes. It rang. Well, this I have no idea who is it. Oh, well, I have Ah, yes, I remember now, got it! Of course, what a fool I am, it totally slipped my mind. It's a girl who brings me... A thing for... But... I don't know her... Go, and open the door! Open the door! But, I don't know her. Hello. Hello. But it's beautiful here. But it's spacious. I present to you, Miss Howell. Widow Delouette. Miss Howell was my former secretary. I know Fred. Miss, Madame Delouette is the widow of this poor Mr. Delouette. - I know, I know Freddy. You know. We know, yes. It's extremely embarrassing situation. So, I suggest you frankly to cut short and... So give me my Bloody Mary. Another one for me Freddy Yes. Shall we sit down? We sit down. He's expecting someone for dinner. I don't know. Sometimes he told me no Sometimes he told me yes, I think he is... Well, then... Thank Fred. - You'll drink your Bloody Mary. And then please excuse me. I think you should go both of you for to dine in a restaurant. You must have a lot of things to tell each other. But my dear Fred. We have already said these things to each other. Is that so? In Orléans, Freddy. In Orléans? Yes, her sister lives in Orléans. Yes. And there too, our dear Charlotte went to relax with the family, to recover from the terrible... Ah yes terrible, it was very terrible, I remember We met each other in a delicatessen, you see. Where I buy my little morning brioches. - Oh yes. Actually, that wasn't the case, you see. Here, change this Bloody Mary, with less vodka please. And me, a little more pepper please. Yes, I got it. You take me for your bartender. A bartender, well come on, but you're crazy Fred. It rang Freddy. Fine, so,... Out. And the fat one too, get out. Easy, Freddy. Come on Fred. Keep calm, go and open door, and be serious. Easy, Freddy. But yes, I'll open the door. Absolutely, I'll open the door. What do you think? I understand, I have to open the door. I'm making fun of you. Virginia. Who are you? - Steve! And Steve what? You asked who I am, I'm... Just stay there, damn you! You asked me, but I'm Steve. Where is Charlotte? In any case this is not Virginia. - But who is Virginia? Bring her up here. Or you can't God damn you. She's my wife for God sake. Freddy darling. I'm so sorry. She called him Freddy darling. Freddy darling! Not bad, eh? Will you shut up. Good evening Mr. Freddy. God damn you, who the hell you think you... Don't you dare touch me. What do you mean? There's damage. Come and see, he's not feeling well at all. Here, here, here I'm. This isn't serious. Be careful, he gets up, he'll be furious. No dreams! - Not at all. Not at all ladies. Your little number was successful, but pointless. Now, you'll try to kick us out? Ah, no, no, not at all, not at all, no, no. I understood, the girl convinced me. I would have loved to go with little Virginia. No way, no way. This is me leaving. I'm leaving, I take off. No Fred. This too, you can't do it. We have other plans, Freddy. I don't care about your project. I don't care. I'm leaving. I'm not a plant in a pot, me. Fred, running away from your responsibilities? Ah, no,no, I'm not running away. Whereas before, I was fleeing. Now I don't flee, I'm going ahead. Goodbye ladies. Don't flee too far, Fred. Goodbye. Landru. Ah, you, spare me your quips. What did you say? Fred. It took us a while to understand... Ah, no, I think you reacted too quickly Louise. Anyway, now we know, we know. We know all that you did. Yes. That thing, The small calculator... the terminal, in your office. Also the statistics about heart attacks and deaths... Okay, no, really! I'm not sure what you're talking about. Assassin... Who's going to believe such a thing. Shall we calculate the risks Freddy? Freddy? We have a solution to offer you. Because you see, we're not diabolical. Your solution, let's have it, as you will see, I have no money. Money! who talks about money! No, it isn't that. Listen Fred. You know, I live alone, and I consider Charlotte, just like my little daughter. Oh, I could be your sister. She needs a man to be happy. So do I, on another level. So, we propose to you, to live together the 3 of us. But it's mad, you're crazy. - But no. Louise is a sweetheart, she cooks fabulous. Also, she is a perfect housekeeper. We will stay with her. She will spoil me And you Freddy you will spoil me It's a nightmare. But I don't care. But you're rude. Listen Fred. Listen. You know my cuisine. And you remember my dishes. And you know the talent of... Charlotte. So... Together, we are the ideal woman. Many men will envy you. Oh, yes. No, no, no, it's not good at all. First, First, it's absolutely immoral what you're proposing. And then, can you imagine? But it's true, one cooking for me, and, it's true, it's delicious, and the other one, and it's true, not bad either. That's if, I'm willing to try. Can I get my dog too? Children, where are you? Oh la la, be careful. Still, don't overdo it. - It's not me, it's her. Say, you didn't resist at all. My Profiterole. I remembered that you liked it. We give you a lot of work. But no, I like to do it. Tell me Fred. Give me your shirts tonight, to wash them. But, I gave you all. Sorry? - Excuse me. I gave you all. But Fred, what's going on. You tear it, you ruin it. It's not me, it's her. No, no, me the shirts, it's my thing. Crack. Never mind, I will buy others. Actually, tonight I have to do the accounts. I propose a joint account. You see Fred, I'll can save you money. I know how to buy. Do you want a hand with the accounts? No, no, no. Go and have fun. I can? Yes. Stop. I got used pretty quickly to my timetable. Charlotte, breakfast, office, lunch, Charlotte. Office, Charlotte. Dinner and Charlotte, to finish. It was exhausting. But interesting enough. One exhausts me, and the other put me back in shape with her food. I wasn't sure If I can keep it on, but for now, everything worked like a charm. But no, It can't be no! What's wrong Louise? We don't have enough money Fred. I have three mouths to feed. Daily living on the rise everyday. The beefsteak unaffordable Fred's salary's too low. Are you sure? - Yes, check the calculation. Me and numbers.... But, I dunno... Charlotte, maybe she can work! Don't talk nonsense. Oh, yeah, not a good idea. No, I, I regret I said that. That's not it. Fred must ask for a pay raise. An increase of how much? 100% is perfect. An increase of 100%? Very well, it's only natural. Very easy. In case they make it difficult, will you consider an alternative? Let's rob a bank. But yes, listen, with the computer, If we calculate everything with the computer, we'll be sure to succeed, right? Are you out of your mind! It won't work? - No it won't. Fred. Louise. But yes! How's your boss. My boss? Yes. In the office, your hierarchical superior. Tournier? If something were to happen to him, to this Tournier, you'd take his place, right? Oh, I see it coming. - Ah, because... Ah, no, out of the question. -But yes, but yes. - Out of the question. But yes, but yes. But yes, but yes. Ah, but no, but no, but no. No need to argue, the topic is closed. I decide, and I say no, there, no. One must not force me. But no Fred honey. We don't wish it, by the way. But yes, but yes, but yes. No, no, no, this would be very wrong. No Fred, it's a decision you have to take it yourself. Tournier, is he worthy of life? It's a question, you have to ask it to yourself, in your soul's depths. And no one can answer it for you. Tournier is an annoying and unpleasant person, it's true. Still, that's not a reason. But of course, after all. Tournier, in fact is doing his job. for decades he speculates on the death of others. How does he speculate? Yeah, he takes people who are afraid to be sick, to die penniless in the hospital, or to be disfigured in a car accident. and he makes them to pay their dues. Huge contributions. It's true from this standpoint it's rather hideous. But no, it's normal. Tournier is in the system. I'll even say it's a victim of the system. Let's not exaggerate. A victim of the system...! A wolf... Still, you can't blame him being in the system in the Center like a spider in her web. A large spider soft and black. Bastard. But, don't write things like this. Murder. A murder. The computer says it. Tournier must die, assassinated. But it's all wrong. An accident, ok. A murder, or assassination. It's all crime, all of that. Yes, but if the computer says it. Anyway, that proves that we are right. If Tournier must die assassinated, because everyone hates him and is a nasty man. What annoys me is that I don't know how to do it, I never killed anyone. Anyway... Damn, how too badly I shoot. Such is life, you are who you are, it's irreversible. I'm not an assassin, that's it. I'm not an assassin. You don't even try, yes. Now, now, don't say that. Fred is very conscientious He doesn't have a creative spirit. He's a little creature of habit. He just has to eliminate this man, as he did your husband. Yeah, but without me. Who is refusing to do some effort, no? Who is refusing? Just eliminate him like your wife. This is a good idea. I install a bathtub in his office. That's it! But, come on, stop arguing, after all. One can smash his head elsewhere than in his bathtub, right? Fill up with Super? No diesel, I want full of diesel in it. Diesel! Oh, Mr. Tournier! - Mr. Malone What are you doing, what's this new invention? It's nothing sir, it's a sprayer, to purify the air, you see. It smells, come on, stop it, stop it immediately. That has no use.... It works. You're fired Malone. You can't do this, it was not the goal. Listen to me Mr. Tournier, please. I always found you stupid Malone. Now you're grotesque also. And remove this equipment, when I speak to you. I'm your boss! And then no, I'm no longer your boss. You don't belong to this firm anymore. You're fired, dismissed. It's over. You can kick the bucket. Damn! What is is wrong? Malone do something. Crazy! Fire Go on, go on. More. Fred, no... Faster, the fire. Serves you right! Go on, faster... I'm very happy. You deserve it, I'm happy. I heard what you just said, Malone. Are you all right? Are you all right? I was so afraid. Don't come any closer, don't touch me, I don't want to be touched. I have a fracture. I need an ambulance. I require a qualified medical staff. Never touch an injured person if you're not a qualified medical staff. I'm injured. My little finger is fractured. A double fracture, could be. So this ambulance, is it coming? It's about time. The following Tuesday, I've become the boss. Indeed the boss. All my needs were met. I had the role of administrator. And of course the office of Tournier. And my salary doubled. Which is not all unpleasant. As for the house, it was not bad at all. My two women were literally in ecstasy. Who wouldn't. But even so... It was really seventh heaven, and all that thanks to me. Let's see, let's see, let's check this out. Did you follow my instructions? Yes Fred, yes. Did you properly dry the guts, for 12 hours? Yes! And did you well smoke them for 48hrs? Cold smoking. Yes, yes. Did you poach them, without boiling? In salt water for 90 minutes? Yes. I feel like vomiting. But what do I hear? Grumble? Don't you love anymore your dear Freddy? But yes Fred we adore you. And after the meal? While Louise washes my socks... rub well! Stop it. Who will have his small treat? You look all depressed. You're not happy to have me here? Of course. But yes, yes, yes. The problem is that It's not varied. Not varied! what is not varied? I'm not varied me? I'm not varied me? You are very good, but. But? We must go out from time to time, for heaven's sake! Of course my dear Charlotte. Of course, if it makes you happy. I don't see why. We're good here. No? We eat well. We're all having a good time. No? Yes. You make me work, believe me. Look, I'll be very nice, I'll finish eating. And then. We go out. We go out. Where? Whatever. Have a drink in a bistro. I know. I'll take you out on a small sentimental pilgrimage. It evokes memories. No, my Lolotte? You sure look happy. How shy I was back then? I was idiot. A loser. Not like now. Well, well, Fred. Now. George. George. Hey, waiter. Mr. Malone, well, so here you are? I know you. -Yes You work for us. -Yes. Your name is Roger, right? -It's Robert. Yeah, right, yes, yes Come sit here. -Good evening Miss Howell. Sit down, you know Miss Howell? Look, I don't want to bother you. No, no, not a bad time, sit down. - Thank you. I introduce you Louise. Louise, this is Roger. - Good evening ladies. Tonight we party, we'll drink champagne. George. Good evening sir. - George! Good evening. So you work with Mr. Malone. Yeah, on the computer Lolotte. Louise. It seems that I gave them a nice evening, my two wives, because from on they kept going out, non-stop. It was even irritating. Then after two weeks, I never knew why. The opposite. Freddy! How lovely. We have missed you. Come, come and sit down. Quickly. Ah, no, ah no. Not these horrible sandwiches. Nevermore, our dear Fred will eat these nasty sandwiches. Ah no, we got you many things, you'll see. Yeah Fred, to start. A good Auvergne soup with Penne brain and bouillabaisse eggs. Yes, Oysters, don't forget the Oysters. Of course, Oysters grilled. Then we have... a soufflé of brill, Saint-Germain style, Followed by poached pheasant. Yeah! A salad with nuts. A cheese pie. And to finish. Fred's little profiteroles! It's good, but is it not a food a little heavy? But no, try to burn calories, before and after. Let's go to burn calories. You'll see, come on, now. No, no, but you're making a lot effort. Wouldn't you like to go out and eat in a snack bar? Go out, never again. Hello Mr. Malone. I saw your secretary bringing you this, I figured, here, maybe it's an occasion to see Mr. Malone. See how well he's going. Not you, my little Roger. What? Not you my little Roger. No, no, my name is Robert. Not Roger. Ah, but it's not an excuse! Are you married? Oh, no, no, no. You're so lucky. Because women... Ah, no sir. Excuse me, I disagree with you. Woman is beautiful Mr., woman is is magical, see. Your calculations are working? Yes, yeah, that's my impression. Good. All the best, my little Roger. Good. So, I'm going back to my computer. Yes, put her on the phone. Fred. - Yes. You must come home earlier tonight. I can't I'm busy. At 17hr Fred. No later. I can't, I'm... Hello. Hello. Ah, it's Freddy. Come. Overall, the results of the second half can be considered satisfying enough. This does not mean, that anyone should believe that they are authorized to ease up in their efforts which will only be beneficial if they are prolonged. This is the case of Mr. Malone. What is happening is unspeakable. - Are you listening Malone? I fell asleep? Excuse me, you know the sleeping pills, I take in the evening, but they wont let me sleep, so they affect me the next day. And in daytime, I must compensate, I must compensate, but... But it will be fine. This man is ill. ??? It's the stress. You're not able to work. But yes sir, I'm working. But no, I assure you it's getting worse day by day. You need a vacation. No, no, no sit, no leave, No leave, I don't want to withdraw, sir. I don't want to withdraw. You have to. No, no sir, please, No leave, I don't want to Look, look, I No leave, please Mr. No. Mercy. No. No! No way. So what happened? They stole my truck. I killed them all. My wife. My friend, my boss. It's because of these two madwomen. They must be stopped, must be arrested. Me, I didn't want it, didn't want it. - They forced you? They forced me, they forced me. They're totally insane. You see what I mean. Give me some details on these crimes. It's easy. It's easy, my wife, I just had to call her. Fracture of the skull. My friend, my friend, I had him have sex till death. Totally. And my boss, my boss, I crushed him with an ambulance. How about that! It's easy, you know, just need to calculate. Just Need to calculate, then bam, he's dead. Me, I didn't want it, it's these two madwomen, but they're totally crazy. You know, they're totally insane. You're going to protect me, you guys. They should be locked up. They should be locked up. I wanted to scream. I was, I was really in a terrible state. Then they brought me here, now. And now you fell much better. I'm fine, I'm perfectly fine. But I'm not cured, doctor, eh? Absolutely not. You won't allow me to leave? You're not sending me back? With those 2 mad women waiting for me out there. To destroy me. May I. Ah, Mr. Frederic Malone. Yeah, only vaguely. He was a colleague of my late husband. at the insurance company LA CERTITUDE, right? Yes, yes. He has some strange obsessions that I want to verify. -Ah yes, I know The police already questioned me about it. Poor Mr. Malone. What do you want to know? Do you live alone? Yes, why? He confirms that he lived in your home with his secretary. This vile creature who was involved in the death of my husband! It's unthinkable, truly. Mr. Malone, wasn't staying with you, no? Malone, living with me? But it's sheer madness, ma'am. Thank you madam, sorry to have bothered you. Oh, don't mention it. Tell me, anyway send my friendship to this poor Mr. Malone. Maybe, I can bring him some biscuits, when he feels better? Of course. Goodbye ma'am. - Goodbye. Fabulous, they all believe he's totally crazy, Bobby, Bobby, your calculations are spectacular. Your calculations, Bobby, I love you. I'm your plaything, you got me all. You're my sensation. Honey. We go upstairs. Do you manage? It's okay, I'm enjoying. And you? Oh, yes, me... Right. Let's say you have had a benign hallucination. Benign! But I'm very sick doctor, you must keep me here. Certainly no. I feel... so free since I'm locked up. Ah, yeah. Precisely, you need to face your morbid desire to be in a shelter. But... Then, what good is that! I was certain of your answer. I had time to observe you since I've been here. Yes, that's exactly what I thought. You are making a big mistake. I'm a dangerous lunatic. But yes, yes, I know. You'll kill everybody. Everybody, maybe not. It might not be necessary.
