# I love you, I love you # I love you # You are the ideal # Of my dreams # I always knew # There would be someone like you # I've loved you forever # It seems # For years in my mind # Fondest Buncie # A picture of your face # I drew # And I knew you somehow # When I met you just now # You are the ideal # Of # My # Dreams # What are you getting so mushy about?

Joined up together, eh? - Yes, ma'am. - Er, we're buddies. Well, you certainly are a sorry looking pair. - We're not sorry. - No, sir, we're just discouraged. What on earth ever prompted you to join the legion? - Well, Brigadier, it was like this... - I came here to help him forget. Forget? Forget what? Well? Well? I forgot. You forgot what you came here to forget?! Well, we'll see that you don't forget what you're here for! We'll start whipping them into shape tomorrow! Yes, sir! Attention! Right face! Fall out!

If you please, sir, we'd like to rectify a small mistake. - Mistake? - Yes, sir. Since joining your army we find that we've been disillusioned. - Disillusioned? - Yes, sir, disillusioned. You see, sir, it was like this - we came here because of a woman. Hm. 99% of us do. What of it? Well, most luckily, sir, we found out just in time that this woman wasn't worth it. No, sir. You know what she did...? And we've decided to leave before it's too late. So you've decided to leave, have you? Yes, sir. If any mail comes for us send it to this address. What do you think this is, a picnic?! You're here, and here you're going to stay. This is the army of forgotten souls. Men come to this Godforsaken spot to forget and be forgotten! Men come here to accept the hardships of the desert and the wasteland! To be without food! Without water! And to laugh at it all! Your comrades will fall bleeding and dying at your side. And you're here to stay until the rattle in your dying throats relieves you! Back to your quarters. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Back to your quarters! Goodbye. Captain Schultz! Take those new recruits and put them through their paces! - Now, sir? - At once, do you hear me? At once! Yes, sir! Open the gates! Open the gates! Company halt! Well, well. Why, my comrades, you're looking better already. Get them to bed early. Thursday, tomorrow, we'll take them out for a real march. - Yes, sir! - Mr General? Couldn't you make that Friday? I can't get up in the mornings... Silence! Right turn! I'm so tired, my feet are killing me. That feels so good. Scratch my back. Scratch your own back, I've got troubles of my own. The gates! The gates! The gates! Come in! What news, ally? Bad news, sahib. The Riffs are preparing to make an attack on Fort Arid. - How strong are they? - They number more than the hairs in the head of Mohammed. We must have reinforcements or the post is doomed. You may go. - Marching orders, Captain. - Yes, sir. Take every man - you leave at once for Fort Arid. - Not the new recruits, sir? - The experience will do them good. - But they're tired... - That is the time to train men, show them what the hardships of the desert mean. - Spare no man but return here quickly. - Yes, my colonel. - Ollie. - What? I feel just like Jeanie Weenie. What do you mean, you feel just like Jeanie Weenie? I feel like I've travelled all over the world. Go to sleep! Attention! Full marching equipment! Fall in! Come on! Attention! Right shoulder, arms! Right face! Forward march! - What's the idea? - I couldn't find my trousers! Stop that squalling! Hey! What have you got your hat turned like that for? Keeps the sun out of the eyes. Try it, it's great. That's a great idea. Company... halt! Company halt! Get back in your places! Get in your lines! Fall in! Do you hear?! - Where's your equipment? - Eh? Where's your equipment? - I wrapped it up in yours. - Oh. - Why, you can't...! - All right, march! But he's got my...! You! Get in the line! And stay there! - You...! - Fall in there! Get a move on! Sandstorm approaching, men! - Indian file! - Indian file! Bring him in. I am the commander. What do you want? Does the commander wish to surrender now or not? Surrender? Hm! Not while I have a man left. By the grace of Allah, this is your last chance. You have my answer. Go! Then the bones of your beloved legionnaires will lie bleaching in the desert sand. Steady, men! He's under a flag of truce. Now then... go back to your scavengers! You can expect anything at any time. Comrades... Comrades, it... it looks like the end. Unless help arrives we are doomed. Caught like... like rats in a trap. Oh... Oh, why don't they come?! Why don't they come?! .. Step, step, step, step. One, two, three, four, step, step, step, step, step. One, two, three, four, step, step... Company, halt! Don't do that! It may be another trick! - Who's there? - Legionnaires! They're here. They're here! Relief at last! Open the gates! Open the gates! Pardon me, is this Fort Arid? Right shoulder, arms! Forward march! Company, halt! Why... where are the rest of the men? Well, you see, Commodore, it was like this. We were sent here with a company, they got lost so I took charge of what was left. Shoot now! All men, back to your posts! Two more gone. - You'll have to take their places. - Yes, sir. Their ammunition is nearly done. Go, climb the walls and open the gates and give us the signal. Go! - Allah akaber! - Allah be with thee! Don't keep following me! You go that way and I'll go this way! Get over there. The signal! Allah be praised, the gates are open! Onward! Onward! The gates! The gates! They're coming to get us! To the walls, men! Use the hand grenades, it's our only chance! Take those grenades and hold the gate. To your places, men! Ah! Throw it! Throw it! Throw it quick! No! Throw it out! Over the gates! Throw it! Oh! Oh! Where is it?! Just hang on there! Give up! Oh! Ah! Charge! We've captured the chief of the riffraff! Yes, sir, he was trying to make a getaway on his dormitory. Not dormitory - dromedary! Oh, yeah, a thing that eats dates. Search him and take him away. No, sahib, not that that. Anything but... Wait a minute! - Take him away! - Yes, but I think you'll definitely...
