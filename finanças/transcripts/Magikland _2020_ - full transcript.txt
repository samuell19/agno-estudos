This year. Why are your phones not on silent mode? Relax, Daniel, we're having dinner. Exactly, we're eating. Is that how you raised Mara? Excuse me. That's how you're raising Kitty. "Kit," not "Kitty." Hey! You insisted! I told you not to buy them gadgets. Excuse me, and who paid for them? But the least that you could have done was tell them not to bring phones to this one dinner. We get together only once. Will you put those phones away? - I'll take those away from you. - Do that later. Cloth for sale! - Looking to buy some cloth, ma'am? Sir? - How much? Excuse me. And what are you looking at? You want me to bang your head on my abs, huh? Could it be that it's your bad breath that's making me look? What a cool thing you snatched, Bekoy! You can sell that for 10,000! Though I pity the grandma that you swiped it from. Almost had a stroke when you hit her with your gun. Her Christmas will still be grand, so quit it. If we sell this, we'll have a great Christmas. Welcome to Magikland! Magikland? Awesome! - What a swell Christmas present! - Magikland? Hey, insect. You're here again? Need me to beat you to a pulp? Cool it. I just wanna see how that thing is played. They say that game is boss. Okay, I'll let you play if you buy it from me. You have 10,000 on you? - What a miser. - Me, a miser? I let you hang out in our headquarters and I'm the miser, huh? So? Give me back my phone! Okay! Okay! I give up! Didn't I tell you cockroaches this is off-limits? And you… Do you like getting hit? - You're an addict, aren't you? - No, sir, I'm not. Get your act together! Is that so? You're always right? Don't shout at me like that. I have been working all year. Why can't I have a decent dinner with my kids? Your kids? What are they? Eggs? That I hatched all by myself? - You're really the best dad. - And you're the model wife? Model mother? Mara, you're really going to cry? That's a big help. How about you, Kitty? Are you happy? - What's wrong with wanting to cry? - So annoying! It's "Kit," not "Kitty!" Kit! Kit! Kit, okay? It's your mom who's the nagger. Our mom, you mean. Besides, Daddy's wrong. So, are we going to be like them and keep squabbling? I don't know. - It's you who is a war freak. - I'm not a good princess like you. How dare you? - You don't know me. - And you don't know me! - They're both wrong. - Exactly. Another Merry Christmas to us. It happens every year. Family tradition, I guess. Boy, your speech later, okay? Get it ready for your mom. Boy, what's with you? It's Christmas. You know your mom's time is limited, don't you? - Quit being so dramatic. - Kyle, it's all right. - Anyway, I know what Boy has to say. - It's annoying. It's not about you. It's about him. I know. Look at him... Boy… Your Christmas Challenge begins now. Look for your first clue. Gugu! What do you think you're doing? Are you looking, or are you just playing? Are you brave enough to take on the Christmas Challenge, Flower Ranger? I believe in you. "Flower Ranger"? Such a sissy name. Master! I found one of them. He's in the top two! You'd be so annoying, if I didn't need you for tips. Of course. Your sister is a top three player of Magikland. Braggart! You're not top one, Warrior Beast. I will be. Just you wait. Those two characters, Smiley Boy and Flower Ranger? I'll clobber them once I finish the Special Christmas Challenge. Discover the locations of the Four Pillars of Magikland… The Mallet, the Sword, the Breastplate, and the Bracelet. Play to win! Play to save Magikland! English? Bummer! And what's the quest about? Treasure? Maybe I can sell it? Your next challenge is in 500 meters. Turn right. Treasure. Treasure. Treasure. Treasure! Gugu, I see them. Get closer, idiot. I found the top three players. Watch them! They must not enter the portal! You're lucky I've reached such a high level. I have a lot of navigation tools. Extreme attention to detail is needed if you are to win. Here's a set of pictures. Which picture doesn't belong? Wait! I know this. Jasmine, dahlia, Bandera Española, Dama de Noche… And… This one's not a flower. This is a cactus. Lophophora williamsii. The peyote cactus. Sometimes your OCD pays off, sister. "Sister"? Really! To win, you have to be quick and agile. Block the Tarsier bombs and win! - Yes! - Yes! Remember I used to tease you for being so skittish? You're so quick, sis! "Sis?" That's so girly. Let's go. Using your resourcefulness, rescue Irra from her sinking ship. Do this under a minute and you will win one million points, Flower Ranger! Who's Irra? You're Flower Ranger? How come you don't know about Irra? No, I just… I forgot. Irra is Pawi's handmaiden. Pawi is just one of Magikland's gods. Be kind to them and they'll reward you with power points... I'm lost. Can this thing be in Tagalog? Give me that. Change language. Filipino. Filipino speaker detected. Change language. Save Irra using your sharpness of mind, Flower Ranger. Save? There, look! Wait a minute. How do I know you're not the enemy? I won't go near you. No, we're friends! Come on, before you sink! But first, I need proof. Who's the most clever shaman in Magikland? Mama Mandalagan. Supreme Shaman of Magikland. Healer. Overseer. Adviser. Well done! I see how you cooperated to save Irra. Two million points for each of you! You're Smiley Boy? You're not smiling. The kids are leveling up too fast. They must not escape. Long live Mogrodo-Or, Magikland's new king! Long live Mogrodo-Or! The top scorers are converging fast. I think we're near the portal! I warned you not to let them near the portal. Do everything to stop them. Or do I have to send Eldin? No, Master. I can do this. You know what you need to do. Congratulations! You are the first four players to complete the Christmas Challenge. Really? You're Smiley Boy? - Why aren't you smiling? - What? Look at yourself. Warrior Beast? How can you be a warrior when you're such a puny creature? Hey! I'm strong. Care to test me? And you are Flower Ranger. Are you, like, a softie? Seriously? Being called a Flower Ranger makes me a softie? Tonight, I'm Flower Ranger. Stop trying to burst my bubble. Hi. I'm Mara. I'm not as good as you all. I just got drawn into this because Warrior Beast is my sister. See that? Are you impressed? This is your destiny! You are the chosen ones! You may be the saviors of Magikland. Looks fantastic! Hey, gang! Guys! To make the jump into Magikland, you have to take the plunge and enter the portal. Once you're there, look for the An at a la Arch. We just jump in? Wait, guys! It's going to be Christmas Eve in a few hours! My mom! Hey guys! Can't you see there's a fire? Kit! Oh, no… We're trapped! - There's no way out! - Flower! Be careful! Oh, no! Find the Arch, and be on your way to find me, Princess Diya. Where's the fire coming from? We're left with no choice. - This is the only path. - Besides, there's no other way out. Come on! Let's do it. No choice, right? Scary. I won't! Ready? Smile… Go! Wait, Kit! That hurts! Where are we? Can this really be Magikland? - But how? - I have no idea. But this sure looks like Magikland. I have to go back. Mother is sick. - And it's Christmas in our world. - But how do we go back? Does anyone see a route going back? - There's none, right? - Hey, wait. Where's Flower Ranger? I think you dropped this. Are you all right, my best friends? - I didn't think I'd find you guys here. - So, what do we do now? - How can we go back? - What do we do, Smiley Boy? "Boy" is fine. You're Kit, right? I'm Mara. You're Flower Ranger. Pat. Just Pat. So what now, Boy? There's the An at a la Arch. That's right! I'm not sure but… I suspect we're inside the game. If we want to go any further, we have to level up. And before we can level up, we need to go forward. But how? Are you sure? No, I'm not. But Mom is sick. - I need to give it a good try. - All of us need to go back. There's no turning back. Going forward means we have to keep going. So that we can level up. Pat! From now on, we travel together. As a team. Where are we now? Excuse me. What is this place? This is the Adventurer's Reception. Who are you? We're not from here. Princess Diya! Success! Our saviors have arrived. Possibly. OMG, you're really Princess Diya. You? We're doomed. We were expecting warriors. But you're just kids. Wait, wait, wait. Miss Princess Diya… Can you explain for… Exactly what is going on? Is this really Magikland? If so, we really need to go home. I'm sorry… It looks like you're stuck here. Only Mogrodo-Or controls all the paths back to your world. Unless we defeat Mogrodo-Or, you're stuck here. For life. - For life? As in? - We're done. Everyone go, we're done fighting. Find a place to hide where Mogrodo-Or can't find us. We're stuck here? Forever? Princess Diya, what about their amulets? Give it to them. They're useless now. Those amulets won't work unless they are warriors. Here are the rewards. Because you have conquered the Christmas Challenge. To kindle your full powers, you must fuse your amulets together. Amulet! The leaf of healing. The warrior's gem. The talisman of fortitude. The dragon jewel. These are your powers. Ready. Smile. Go! They're good! Are you all right? I'm dead! Oh, no! It seems they're getting stronger! Your Majesty, here they are. Headman Baldo. At last! Damn you, you old bag of bones. You're behind the rebellion against me. Have pity on my son and grandchild. You're not the true king here. You killed our rightful king. You have no right to rule this land. May you rot in hell, you and your black soul. Come. Mama Mandalagan! Here they are! The fruits of your labor. Mama Mandalagan? Long name. Mara, your warrior name is Mara Marapara. Named after Mount Marapara which nurtures plants that heal. Pat, your warrior name is Pat Patag. The strength of your heart is as strong as Mount Patag. Kit. Your warrior name is Kit Kanlaon. Your passion matches the eruptions of Mount Kanlaon. Boy. Your warrior name is Boy Bakunawa. You possess the valor of Bakunawa. The dragon king. Boy Bakunawa, Kit Kanlaon, Pat Patag, Mara Marapara. You all came to me in my dreams. The four of you will save us! Mama Mandala… Mama Mandaluyong. Stick to "Mama,". I know you find my name long. Any questions? You mean I'm not here by chance? I just picked up the phone from these kids. I'm not Flower Ranger. It's how you carry it. I'm just good at pretending. There's nothing more wonderful in life than the unexpected. You were meant to be here. You too, Mara. And, you, Kit. Especially you, Boy. The four of you are special. Now, listen carefully. This is your mission. Find your power… BREASTPLATE OF FORTITUDE BRACELET OF PEACE …and use these powers to save Magikland. Mama Mandalagan, shouldn't we be helping them? No. Mogrodo-Or should not find out that the final battle has begun. Believe me. This is our last hope. But why kids? Because only the pure of heart can face him. I believe in you. If I could only bring back yesterday… I would give my life to save your beloved father and his queen, my poor dear sister. Mogrodo-Or will pay. He will surely pay. I'll make sure of that. Let's stick to the original plan. I'll take care of the kids. They need to succeed in their mission. To awaken the gods of Magikland to stand against Mogrodo-Or. Their first mission… Help guide Pat Patag towards Pawi Cave… MALLET OF COURAGE SWORD OF LOYALTY …for him to find the armor signifying fortitude in the face of brutal punishment. OMG. I know, right? This place is beautiful. Really very beautiful. "Khorun, fishing village. Ruler, Pawi. Turtle-god of the ocean. Primary livelihood, fishing. "Inhabitants… Humans"? Take a look. It says here that humans inhabit Khorun. Are those humans? They look like merfolk. - What do you think happened? - Maybe they were eaten. - Well, why don't they eat us? - Maybe they're full. Hey! Keep it down! Now they want to eat us! Pinakas? Let's talk to him. Do you know the way to Pawi's cave? Bro! Read my lips. Pawi. Pa-ah-wah-ee. Pawi. Wait! Wait! Kid! Hey, kid! Wait. People! Humans! Wait! Boy, where are you? - Is this you? - Yeah, that's my nose. No! That's my elbow! So who's holding me? What are you doing here? We're looking for Pawi's cave. Is Pawi's cave so important that… You put us all in danger? You'll get us all killed for a fairy tale! Somebody help me! Help! Excuse me, bros! Just because Grandpa is a little off, don't mess with him! Just make sure you can hit me. That's enough! Hey, Pat! Pat! So it's true that there are dragons here. - Where are they? - Gone. Those fish men are wimps. It's like getting hit by a pillow. I fell asleep. Yeah, it looked like you had really sweet dreams. - Uncle, are you okay? - I'm all right. Listen here… Just ignore the Pinakas. Just leave them alone. And you? - Why did you let yourself get beaten up? - I'm used to it. I'm fine, Grandfather… Grandfather… Dagrin. Not "Grandfather." Dagrin, okay? Eat up. It's delicious. Did you know? It's been five years since Irra sailed off. Once a year, she would go to Pawi's cave. Pawi's cave? Can you show us how to get there? - The way to Pawi's cave? - Yes, sir. - Hey, you two, take care of those, okay? - Yes, sir! Hurry up. Hurry! From the Khorun Riverbank, you will reach the tiny Pawi Lake. When you reach this lake, you will hear a mermaid singing. Where are we now? Where are the mermaids? We believed in that loony. Who's loony? Oh, my God. Miss, who are you? Are you a mermaid, Miss Beautiful? I'm Irra. What are you doing here? You're the granddaughter of... Here I was singing and singing to the point of losing my voice and you still didn't notice me. Do you want to go to Pawi's cave, or not? - Of course. - Then jump in. - Wait, why? - Jump! They're on their way to Pawi's Cave. I can't swim, Master! It's beautiful here. What is beautiful can be deadly. There was a throne here. The only thing left of Lord Pawi. The Breastplate of Fortitude. Made from the shell of Lord Pawi. Lord Pawi is summoning you! You're smiling like you're in line for a free meal. Harsh! You're chosen. Go ahead. Take it and bring back peace to Khorun. Wait a minute, it feels rubbery. What's rubbery? It's, like, tough. It shouldn't be that tough if you were really chosen! Mama Mandaluyong was wrong. I don't belong here! You can do it, Pat! Fortitude and strength of will in all its purity and worth only springs forth when summoned for the benefit of the helpless. Your strength comes from your ability to withstand trials and pain. Only after suffering will you find relief. I hope you find your breastplate of inner strength. The Breastplate of Fortitude! Pat got it! Here they are again! OMG, way to go, Pat Patag! My hero! Thanks. They look happy. Now for the next mission. It says here we go through Talisay Forest, and the Temple of Idik-Idik is in the area. - Then let's take the temple first. - What? Do you really want to take the farther one first? I can't wait to find out my powers. Let's go then! PAT - ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED! BREASTPLATE OF FORTITUDE Kit Kanlaon needs the mallet of fiery courage. NEXT MISSION Help her in her journey to Idik-Idik. Mogrodo-Or, our lord, you have a visitor. The Gem of Balance has been found in Turok, Mogrodo-Or, our lord. There is nothing more precious. Transfer the Gem of Balance to our lord's brow. Now that Lord Mogrodo-Or has the Gem of Balance, he can conquer all of Magikland. We're so near, I can smell the volcano. Hear that? It's coming from there. Forgive me… Marget! - Why are you here? - Are you by yourself? Where's your mother? Marget! What's wrong with you? Why did you run off? Look where you are! Please forgive her. When the Pinakas left, she looked for you. Please excuse us. We have a long way to go. We need to leave. Just go straight and you'll be out of the forest. Let's go, quickly! Sorry again. Come on! Don't you feel sorry for Marget? What is it now, Mara? How do you think Marget feels right now... I don't care! We have a bigger mission right now! Isn't our mission to rescue Magikland? Our mission is the volcano. So, let's go. - So, our missions are different? - All right, they're fighting. Do you know what it felt like when you and Mommy abandoned me? Are we back to that? - You and Daddy left me! - I'll take Mara, you take Kit. Why do I take Kit? Shouldn't it be you? Wait a minute. Do you also like Mara? We're not here to get girlfriends. Just leave! That's what you and Mommy are good at! Maybe she chose me because you are impossible to love! You and Daddy are the same! Mara! Hey, wait for me, Kit! Conflict is weakness. The way is fraught with danger when the team is not united. As long as they walk separate paths, the team is in grave danger. May they reunite before it's too late. We shouldn't have split up. We're almost there, now you want to chicken out? Almost there? Are you sure? No. - Come on, let's talk to them. - Okay. You first. Why me? You wanted to come here. Are they going to eat us? I hope not. I hope they're vegetarians. They might be vegan. Get it? From Ilocos. Hey, what are you? Excuse me, sir. Can we talk? - I think he's deaf. - They might have a different language. Urul. You're Urul? I'm Pat Patag. She's Kit Kanlaon. You going… Idik-Idik? Tagalog? Really? Just a little Tagalog. OMG, wow, seriously? Mara Marapara seeks the leaf that is key to finding the bracelet of reconciliation. MARA: GO TO TALISAY FOREST AND LOOK FOR THE BRACELET OF PEACE May she succeed in her quest. - Why are you in our territory? - I'm sorry, sir. I'm looking for the Golden Yaro. Golden Yaro? - Can you help me? - Help? Are you joking? You come here to beg… You have no respect! You humans are all the same! Raygar! Still alive, Ilian? You're tough. You got lucky, Raygar. Now is the final reckoning. What do you think of me? You think I won't fight you just because you're wounded? You're dying and you still want to fight me! Papa Ilian! Marget! Take her. Do you even know why you are killing yourselves? The reason why you hate each other so? Isn't choosing not to fight a kind of victory? When the soul is enlightened, there is beauty in the person. And when there is beauty in the person, harmony rules the house. When harmony rules the house, the whole nation will have order. And when the nation has order, peace will reign in the world. I would like to do now what I came here to do. The shoot of the Golden Yaro. Compassion and empathy. The truest form of love is when you give yourself to those who are alone. The language of the heart is understood by everyone. Because you are overflowing with love, you are able to sympathize. And because of your eternal well of compassion, you can heal the grief of others. Mara Marapara, I see that you will earn your Bracelet of Peace. Bless you, my child. Papa! Papa! Thank you, God of the Forest. BRACELET OF PEACE That's a huge firefly! Firefly… It's my first time seeing one. Intruders! Strangers! What are you doing in our domain? - Answer! - That hurt! Who are you? Why are there children here? Pat! Pat! What's your name again, Uncle? Duri. I'm Kit. He's Pat. Kit? Pat? Do you know how to get out of here, Duri? Are you sure? Boris looking for fight. If Boris lose fight… Prize! Who wants to fight? Are you Boris? What's the prize? Is the offer still good? Can we still avail? Bedbug! Anyone else? Bring me back. I can take him. Rest first. Duri's been waiting a long time for us. He knew we were coming? Mama Mandalagan told him about the saviors. Saviors? Yes. Saviors. That's us. And here's more, they've been impatient for us to arrive 'cause we're the sign for them to rise up. Boy? Boy? Boy? Good boy. Boy! Are you ready to rumble? It's time to rock in Turok! Who will fight Boris? Fight! Me dizzy. You no worry. Me sing… Song of death! Why you stop me? Me not finished. Me no care! - Don't be stupid! - You stupid! One, two, three! Yes! What's the prize? Freedom. The kids are about to find Idik-idik Temple… LOOK FOR THE MALLET OF COURAGE AT THE TEMPLE OF IDIK-IDIK …which houses the Mallet of Courage. Come on! You've been really waiting for this, yes? Yes. I've been dreaming all day what my powers will be. I'm happy for you. I hope Mara and Boy are okay. Me too. Quick, take it. I got this. Can I do this? Justice and equality. True virtue is measured by the strength of one's desire in the sea of doubt. You can do it. Heroism lies between rashness and cowardice. Your fortitude will free the oppressed. May the gods bless you, Kit Kanlaon, and may you wield the Mallet of Valor. Yes! Kit! Kit! Kit! Kit! Kit! Let's get her up. Are you okay? Kit! I'm sorry, Mara. Wait. Don't move. Kit! Kit! I'm sorry, Kit. You're so brave. You're the bravest person I know. Thanks. Let's go. Pat? You're something else, you know? You take all the hits. Even the ones meant for us. Thank you. You need this, too. Worthless dogs! They're just kids! I'm not here just to feed you! Nobody move. I can feel it. Inside me. The hatred, the anger and the despair. Soon… All of Magikland will be mine. And after that, the whole world! MALLET OF COURAGE Although the team has regrouped… LOOK FOR THE SWORD OF LOYALTY AT THE TOWER OF HEAVEN'S END …Boy Bakunawa bears the heaviest burden… …to gain possession of the Sword of Loyalty. Mara, wait. Look at this. It's beautiful. Really very beautiful. Look at those two. It's either cute, or gross. Are you okay? Why not? What's your problem? I was just thinking… Of Mama… You guys… And if I'm able to save everyone. We're almost at the end. We're this close to getting your powers. Yes… but is it enough? Will my powers be enough? Will I be enough? Kabayoyo! Kabayoyo! Stop that! Boy, where are you going? Are you looking for a fight? 'Cause you'll get a fight! That's Bakunawa! Hit him with all you've got! - Let's get them! - Relax. Get back, it's hot! Be quiet. Let's not upset it. I'll be careful. Good boy. Good boy. Boy! - Come on! - Kit! Bakunawa. The last of the gods of Magikland. There he is. There's no need to be afraid, Lord Bakunawa. Don't be sad. We won't leave you. I'm Boy. Boy Bakunawa. We share the same name. No one will hurt you anymore. Hey, Pat! This is Pat. Pat Patag. He's a pest, but he'll always have your back. This is Kit Kanlaon. She's grumpy, but she'll stand by you. This is our friend Mara. Mara Marapara. She can heal any wound! Yeah, she's a doctor. He's beautiful. We meet again, my friend. Aren't you glad? We're done hiding, so you can meet all your friends, Pawi, Us as a, and Idik-Idik. Where, you ask? In hell. No! Not Bakunawa! - Let go! - Who do you think you are? Boy Bakunawa. What's your problem? Small, but terrible. Boy! You think you can take me? Boy! Boy! Let me go! Boy? Wake up, Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy. Ma? Boy. Mama! - Ma! - Boy! Mama! Ma. Ma! Yes, Boy? Ma! What's with you? We see each other every day. I'm sorry, Ma. Sorry for what? I should be the one saying sorry. You? Why? Because I'm leaving you. Because I'm about to die. You don't want me to die, right? Mom? Look into your heart. - Are you the reason why I'm dying? - No! Boy! Your mommy is no longer sick 'cause she's dead! - You killed her! - No! You are the reason why your mother is dead! Liars! You don't know anything! What if we made you eat your tablet? You're not real! - After all, that's all you're good at! - You don't know anything! Can you bring back our sister? Who are you to talk? So die already! You're not real! Only Mama understands! What a pity. But you picked the wrong fight. Thank you. Bakunawa! Bakunawa! We can heal you. Just wait for me. Don't give up. Bakunawa… Don't go… Didn't I promise you? Didn't I say I won't leave you? Answer me! Why are you leaving? Why are you leaving me? Why? You have a great heart. Wait. I understand your pain, Boy Bakunawa, and the anguish in your breast. If true power is measured by what's in our heart, your heart, Boy, is full of love. Boy… Save Magikland from Mogrodo-Or. Use the greatest weapon we have against malevolence, your faithful heart. Let the Sword of Loyalty be rendered unto you. Bakunawa… You and I… Are now one. Our waiting is at an end! Arise, my minions! This is what we've been waiting for! Our time of reckoning. Burn all of Magikland! You guys think you're tough? Now you're done. Son of a... Who's that? Go, Boy! You took your time, insect. We've been waiting. Perfect, 'cause I've been waiting to finish you. Let me go! You're stinky! Put those down! Boy! The Balance. Balance? The Gem of Balance is ripe within me. Kit! Let's go! Disunited, you are but a drop of water. Join forces and you become a raging sea. Bakunawa! Eclipse Slash! That was so cool! We defeated Mogrodo-Or! But we lost the Gem of Balance. So we've lost? If we don't return the gem to Bakunawa, nothing will change. We will have failed in our mission. Mr. Bakunawa, ma'am, sir, is this yours? MISSION COMPLETE! You saved us from Mogrodo-Or. Thanks to you to all, we now have a new queen. Boy, we give you the honor of crowning her. Virtue has prevailed. Thank you. Mama Mandalagan was right. Forgive me for doubting you. Thank you. The world is so big, we have so much to learn. Again, thanks. My heart can be happy again. As well as the hearts in all of Magikland. We will forever be in your debt. As a reward, we will send you home to the exact time when you entered the portal. December 24? It will still be Christmas Eve! We can still make it to Christmas dinner? That's right… You guys can still celebrate. Join me! You can join us too. Thanks, Mara, Kit, Boy. But I don't have anyone back there. I'd rather stay here. Mama Mandalagan, may I stay? I don't want to sleep on the street anymore! Why not? I'm sure the people of Magikland will be thrilled to know that one of the saviors will be staying with us. So, is this how it ends? We won't be seeing... - Aren't you guys too young for this? - Leave them alone. Who knows, I might find a way. This is Magikland, anything is possible. It's magic, right? Thank you, Warrior Beast, Mara, Flower Ranger and Smiley Boy. May you have a safe journey. - What I want is… - Mommy! Daddy! What's this? I got everything from you, Mama. Your courage… Strength and trust. So my wish for you is that you are able to do what you always ask me to do. To smile always. Because it makes the problems go away. Mama? Smile, Mama. Daring to go on an adventure is a sign of love. Love is the incarnation of a golden heart. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
