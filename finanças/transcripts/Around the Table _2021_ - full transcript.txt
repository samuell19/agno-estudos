Thanks. Why not sit? Oh, okay. No need to be formal. But, I'm younger... How old? 15. I'm only two years older. Well, yeah. Have some. A glass... Where's your mom? She's at work. She'll be home soon. Riku! Riku! Riku! Read this for me. Sorao.. Ah! Excuse me! Oh, you move in today? Thanks for having me. I'm Yuko. I'm Sorao. Nice to meet you. 15 minutes till deadline. Crunch time. Deadline? My "Moguran and Tatsumaru" script. A kids' show. Really?! That's amazing! You're a scriptwriter? Yes. I'm actually a novelist, but I do this too sometimes. Oh, I know it! It's so cute. It's really about Earth after humanity dies out. Yeah.. I like it. Ending's a bit abrupt. Did you get the anti-patriarchal message? Not at all. Never mind. Riku, thanks! Later, Yuko. Your dad? No, no. What is he then? Er, how can I put it.. My mom's friend lives here too. He's her boyfriend. So, the four of you all live here? Weird. I get that a lot. Dad's not around? - He's not. - Mine too. Divorce? Same here. It seems our moms have been friends a long time. Yeah, but.. I'm home! There she is. Hi... Art college prep school? That takes me back. You studied art, Meiko? Yeah. No Tokyo prep school though. You're brave. No, it's just summer school. Like a trial course. In Year 2 of high school? Wow, that looks great! Yuko's in my room, so you're with Riku. Hi roomie. Sorao, you'll drink? Sure. It's a welcome party. Sure is, sure is.. Hey! Take this. Thanks. So so so. Yuko, your mom's the famous Tomoyo? Oh, yes. That's right. I'm a big fan of her. Yeah? Really? I follow her Insta, and suggested her at work. Also, you know... There. Shall we eat? Wow, it looks delish! Yuko, welcome to the house of Aoba. Looking forward to these two weeks. Now then. Bless this food! AROUND THE TABLE What's this...? I'm on breakfast duty this week. Sorry. He's into tacos, so it's tacos everyday. It's tacos research month. Yuko, use this lunchbox. Oh, thank you. Where's Riku? Band practice. His band? He's crazy about it lately. Yuko, day one of prep school huh? I'm nervous. Hang in there. You'll be fine. Sharpen each pencil with sincerity. Need this? Don't know how? It's my first day. It's my first day too. Give it to me. "Welcome party after school!" "Take Chocolate Sleepover's debut single 'This won't Do, ' and interpret it your way." "Your way," huh? "Your cover version." "The group will assess entries thoroughly..." The winning band gets invited to their show. I know already. How many times have you read that? Let me read it, okay? They suddenly reformed, and there's a cover competition! They broke up 20 years ago. You're such a nerd. If we send them our cover, will Recman listen to it?! Highly probable. Enough already. Let's practice. Fancy some corn tea? Hi Mr. Daikuhara. A band, huh? Way to go. Too noisy? No way! I was in a band. Those were the days... Okay Dad. Take your cue to leave. Smartly. Take your time! There's more tea. Let's listen to their indie songs again. Um, I want to be an illustrator, so I'm applying for Graphic Design. Nice to meet you. Okay, next. Yudai. I'm Yudai Seo. I like music, movies, design, and more. Nice to meet you. Say where you're interning. Well, I'm an intern at design office HA9. Yudai, you don't need school. A national college for me. Don't say "Huh?!" Nice to meet you! Okay, next. I'm Yuko Kunieda. I like music, movies, all kinds of culture. I started a YouTube channel too. And, um.. My mother is Tomoyo Kunieda. She gets interviewed a lot, so lately I've been thinking a media job might be good too. Nice to meet you. Applause! Okay, next. Um, I'm Koyuki Sato. I want to create manga... So Akane, you're not from Tokyo either? My big sister lives here, so I'm staying with her. Right, right. That Yudai guy's interning even through he's a high schooler. What a cocky jerk. But he's the most talented. National college-bound, and a rival. You want to go too? Private's too hard. What about you? I'm still wavering. I should get going. Huh? Already? Despite your hair color? What about my hair color? My sister'll worry. Hey... Um... My mom's on TV today. Better hurry. So I... don't want to go back. A casual Chinese restaurant with a refined decor. Proprietor Tomoyo Kunieda's unique lifestyle is drawing attention. Her three books have all become bestsellers. Hey. I'll do the dishes later. Nearly done. Too bad Yuko's late tonight. What do I pride myself on? Nothing! But if I have to name one thing, it's talking to my customers. I talk to them, eagerly... Haruko, you've got such a famous friend. Well, I haven't seen her in years. Manpuku's signature menu item is "Hah-chan rice." One Hah-chan rice! A simple but addictive dish. Having a stylish mom is pretty hard. "Her daughter must be cool too," people say. Sounds annoying. So I study movies, music and stuff so I can be cooler. You're a YouTuber? Yeah, I just started.. - Lemme see. - Huh? Not yet... - Show me. - My editing sucks. Okay, I'm outta here. You know those times when you've got to knuckle down? To fire myself up, I take big deep breaths. I suck in as much air as my lungs can take, then I feel like taking on the world. Give it a try. Breathe in like "Hah." That's it. Breathe in. Feel like a world-beater? I do it when I need a boost. I really recommend it. It's almost like a magic spell. When I read a book or watch a film, I write down my impressions, so their art becomes my own flesh. You... edited this yourself? Yeah. It's more a hobby than art. The narration's just a stopgap. I honestly don't want to rely on my mother's fame, so I've decided to hone my own senses. Yuko Kunieda's Nine Essences. Essence 1: Don't use my mother's name. You broke your essence! Shut up! I hate myself for doing that! You're so funny! Mom got interviewed at home, so I thought I'd try. Are you nuts? You envy your mom? Is that pathetic? No, it's awesome. Really? I like you, Yuko. Hey, why don't we make something together? Good idea. Like what? Dunno. Any ideas? Come on, it was your idea. Oh man. How about.. a zine? You mean, of our illustrations? Illustrations or anything. A magazine of stuff we like. Wow! I love it! I love it! Okay, we'll take turns drawing in a notebook. It'll be done by the end of the course. Fantastic! Let's do it! Promise me! Alright. Not so close. Oh, sorry. I love it. A zine. 'Morning. 'Morning. You get stubble? Yeah. Quite a lot. Is that your own razor? This is Sorao's, but I'll buy my own. Sorry, I'll hurry. Oh, you don't have to. You like Chocolate Sleepover? I like them too. Huh? Really? No way! How come? Well, my parents liked them. Ah, me too! You wore their t-shirt. Isn't it cool? Lend it to me. Just kidding. My t-shirt? Yeah. I like the design. Okay. Wait right there. Huh? Doesn't have to be now.. - Ta-da! - Our zine"! Whoa! Akane, this is great! I stayed up till late. The colors and the feel of it are so cool. Okay! My turn next. If we do it everyday, it'll be pretty big. What's a good subject? - You'll find one. - Hey... You like that band? Few people our age like them. I'm so stoked! Favorite song? Top hard. Sorry! I'll tell you mine. Wait, which one? A different one every day. "Lately, after 45 listens, 'This won't Do" is best! That hidden lyric "knock knock" actually might be "nonchalant," but... That was creepy. Did he ramble on for 30 minutes? His own words made him teary-eyed. What a creep. What a creep! Yudai knows so much about music. Yudai Seo. Why his full name? I wanted to say it. I like the sound of it. For real? Akane, your sketches are amazing. Well, Yudai got better feedback than me. He's my rival. Yudai Seo.. Madoka, you've got rhythm. It's kinda fun. How do we interpret it our way? I wanna rap. No no no, it won't be a cover then. Get with the program. What would Recman do? Let's rethink it. Hey, how about we play it 100% faster? What was that? This place has always made strange noises. Like... the end of the world, or something. Supernatural? Let's go look. Hurry. Dear Akane. There's something I have to tell you about myself. Let me explain my history of creativity. Ta-da! Well? It's cute. I once wanted to be a clay artist, but it didn't feel right. I learned guitar too, but skipped my school festival. I tried dying t-shirts, and taking photos. It wasn't for me. I made videos for YouTube, but never released them. I also did skateboarding. Whenever I tried something, I loved it, but for some reason.. It felt wrong. Like it didn't fit me. So many abandoned efforts. Why? Creative history's a cool idea. I come from a boring backwater town, so I can't wait to get into art college. When I'm older, I want to design lots of books. Akane, your dream is clear-cut. I'd like to be that passionate, but sketching is so damn hard. You're not looking. Look closely. I'll show you. I did badly again today, so I practiced at home. Hands are so familiar to us, but their shape is so surprising. Way to go. You've got it. Potential's all I've got. "Hands of the House of Aoba" Well done. At the House of Aoba where I stay, Haruko usually makes dinner, and it's always so delicious! This is great! Then the other day, she suddenly said she'd quit, so Meiko took over and started preparing dinner. Her motto is to never use a knife, but it's surprisingly, super tasty! Wow.. It's so good! Breakfasts are still Sorao's taco experiments. We're sick of them, and we keep complaining... but we can't help eating. It's fun to see Sorao, watching us proudly I want tacos too.. So do I. "One-minute sketches" Yudai Seo. My greatest current interest. Okay, next! Huh? What's so great about him What? Akane, he's not your enemy. Riku? Knock, please! Oh sorry, sorry. Can you play this? A guy called Yudai made this mix CD. Mix as in lots of artists... I know what it means. Oh sorry, sorry. He went to the trouble of making it for me. Wow, I don't know any of these songs. I know some of them. I like this one. So do I. Your t-shirt brought us together. He likes the same band! He even got a ticket to their next show. I wish I could go.. Want to.. Join my band? I joined a junior high band. I like it. I like where they rehearse too. That happens a lot here. Not again.. Isn't it too much? I think it's just right. I want a grown-up look. A high school look's better for you. Everybody'll be older. That's why. Looking mature's good, yeah? Ah, how about this? It's cute! A design office party... What's that? It's beyond me. And this too. It's pretty. It's beyond my solar system. Bigger earrings, you think? Oh, great! Man, I'm really nervous now. Are you sure we can come too? Yeah, friends are okay. We better hurry then. You're keen. So I can leave early. Why'd you come? To chaperone Yuko. Thanks. Anyway, what's with the weird getup? Huh? What's weird? The faked grownup look. Yeah, you're right. This is a disaster.. Here. Swap you. Looks better on me. Gimme a break. Looks good on you. Okay. Shall we go? "3rd anniversary" Thank you! Have fun. Hello! What? I so wanted to read this. It's out of print. Yuko. This is Yuko. These people let me intern here, Yashiki and Shimasa. Hello. The famous Yuko. I'm Yuko Kunieda. Wow. A business card. Sorry, I ran out of mine. Oh, it's fine. I've seen your gum ads all over Odakyu trains, and your album covers. Your work's always cool. No, we're just getting off the ground. Yudai, could you help at reception? Sure! Okay Yuko, see you later. Something to drink? I'm interested in this kind of work. Are you all art college grads? Well, about 50% of us are. Wow. Is that right? What's Tomoyo like in everyday life? Um, like everyone else. Takes saunas to unwind. She posted about them on Insta first. She sure did. She took me to one once, but it was so hot I had to leave. Well, they are hot. Oh, we have that glass. For real? Lucky, me and Tomoyo. She uses stuff like this? She's not bothered by price. You don't say! I like that about her. That is her. Yeah, she's got it all. Balanced, you know? Unbalanced, but balanced. An advanced level of balance. I'm smitten. How often does Tomoyo come back to Tokyo? Tomoyo... Tomoyo... Sorry, may I throw up? May I throw up? Y-You okay? I feel sick. Not there! Not there! Where can I then? N-Nowhere here! Hold it in! Hold it in! Somebody help! Help! Thanks for that. Damn, I should've thrown up. I brought up my mom again. They wanted you to. Yeah. People like hearing about her more. You know, it's like... We're young, so we get looked down on, and that's infuriating, but we've got our whole lives ahead of us. We can study and become anything we want. We can say "This is me!" and be proud of it. Maybe. There I go, talking all idealistically. No, thank you, Akane. I forgot I have amazing potential. Damn right. I like your art, but I also like your writing. I want to read more about you, not somebody else. Really? Back in my hometown, nobody gets me. Same here. But, thanks to books, I got this far. So I want to do book design. Books that girls like me would look at and think, "Ah, this is for me." Ta-da! I stole it as revenge. Whoa, you're a bad girl! Hey, gimme your card. Great. A new bookmark. Huh?! Then give it back! "This won't Do" "Mock exam: charcoal sketch" Okay, we'll go buy food. Alright, take care. See you later. Yuko mentioned a mock exam. Yeah, she'll be back soon. I'm back. There she is. Huh? Let her sleep? Yuko, want to head out? Huh? Where? You know where. Excellent. All to ourselves again. This is amazing. Cool, yeah? The city started this night pool, but nobody comes. We come here sometimes and drink together. Our sketches were lined up according to their ranking. My best friend's was at the top, but mine was bottom. Art evaluation's so harsh. I realize I'm so below everybody, and it's embarrassing, and frustrating. Most of all, I feel like I'm always a letdown, and it's paralyzing. A letdown... to Tomoyo? Mom knows me through and through. Whatever I want to wear, watch, or study, she knows exactly what suits me. She's always right. I always loved art, so I said I'd do it and got this far, but... I messed up, same pattern as always. I get it. Sorry. You think I wouldn't, but sorry, only I get it. Sorry. Sorry to interrupt. Keep going. You say sorry a lot. So, my mom... Apologies for saying this in front of a fan, but she's got a tendency to "produce" everything. She's way too confident! She always has been! Haruko, you and my mom.. We haven't spoken for 20 years. You haven't? Where did they go? "Just heading out" means... walking-in-sandals distance? Some people go on vacation in sandals. Good point. Okay. All that's left is to fry them. Want to try? Yeah! Be careful. That's the way. Wow. After graduating university, we drifted around for a while. We kept talking about opening a restaurant together. But then you.. We didn't. For various reasons, we went our separate ways, and lost touch. My mom is Tomoyo Kunieda, so I've got to become my own person. I've tried lots of things, but none of them felt right. My prep school friends know what they want to be, and are going for it. I don't even know what I want to be. What you want to be, huh... There! That stupid deep breathing! Go easy on her.. It's so pretentious. She said the same crap in a magazine interview. You check what she does? I'll be brutally honest. I check everything she does! Seriously?! Haruko, you're crazy! They're best friends now? Beats me.. Hey. You don't have to try so hard. I mean, you should do what you've got to do, but, if it doesn't feel right, try something else. You think so? Yeah. Until you find one thing that's for you. I agree. Right. One thing. Okay! This summer, I'll find that one thing. Go for it! It's as if who I was 20 years ago is saying that. Got it. Yuko, I think I'll go see Tomoyo. It's been bugging me for years, but I'm going to settle it. You okay? Why wouldn't I be? Well, you got criticized badly yesterday. I slept and forgot it. Today's our band recording. That's important? Oh, Akane, tonight. Okay? Don't forget. "Manpuku" Open for lunch only today! Excuse me. Sorry, today is lunch only! Oh, I'm not a customer. I'm Tomoyo's classmate, Haruko Aoba. Is Tomoyo in? Tomoyo's with a foreign TV crew. A foreign TV crew? I see... Okay, I'll kill time nearby, and come back. Oh no! Please wait! This is a special case, so... Please sit here if you like! Are you sure? Please, please! Alright. Excuse me. I'll bring some tea! Thank you. Hey there! That's great. "Closed" Refill! Thank you. I'm back! Kosuke, thanks a lot! Hope it went well! Your friend is here.. Tomoyo. Long time no see. Way too long! Way too long... I would've made a reservation if you'd called. The Thai place might still be open.. Oh, don't mind me. Sorry it's so sudden. I should apologize, for dumping Yuko on you. Yeah. You messaged me out of the blue. I was shocked. I'm sorry, really. Been well? As you can see. I'm getting by. This place is nice. I always wanted you to come. You know, timing.. I hope she's not a problem. Not at all. She's a great kid. You must be joking. She's a pain, isn't she? She's not a pain. She confided in me too. About what? Where should I start.. Well.. It's okay. I pretty much know anyway. Hey, what kind of job do you do now? I sell knickknacks and clothes online. Wow, that's cool. You always did love clothes. That outfit looks good on you. Thanks. You always liked colors and fabrics like that. Huh? I wouldn't say that. You haven't changed. They look good on you, but... What? Oh, nothing. Come on, what? If you don't try something new, you get stuck. Huh? Trying too hard is much lamer. That's so like you, Haruko! Meaning what? Listen, I tried lots of new things, and settled on this. Alright alright, I get it. Anyway, you hungry too? I'm gonna say it. Listen, Yuko can't handle being "produced" by you. "Produced"? That old habit of yours. You try to package everything. What, you came all this way to fight? No! I just... Maybe I did. Maybe I came to fight. Look, Tomoyo, you got famous thanks to my fried rice. So sorry about that! After all, it was my idea. Your Hah-chan rice. The idea came from our plans for a restaurant! You didn't care about cooking. Now you're Top Chef. I am not! What? Are you jealous? Not one little bit. Why would you be? It was you who betrayed me. I'm leaving, came here too late. Not so fast. Sorry to bother you. Not so fast! Take this! Tomoyo?! What, what? My back... Your back? Why... Your back.. Tomoyo! You threw your back out again?! I should've helped you! What now? Call an ambulance? Too much? Just leave, okay?! No, I can't! I want to, but I can't! What about tomorrow's TV shoot?! Shiso leaves? Where? Oh, ohba leaves? Isn't that takuan? "Midsummer Regret" flavor? What's that? Whatever, just look forward to it. They're surprisingly authentic. Had your band recording? It went really well. Can I hear it? I'm not done mixing it. Okay, fried fish tacos. I can't wait. Chef's special for me. I should've had that! - Have some of mine. - Yay! A young guy like you liking Chocolate Sleepover is so rare! I'm... not the only one. What did you do? I was chorus and melodica. Melodica as an homage to their song "Tender One"? Oh, you know it? I knew it! That's such a classy choice! Wow, you noticed?! Man, I wish I was in a band too. Riku, I had a great time. Maybe bands are my thing. Thanks for inviting me. Thank you too. Hope you see their show. By the way, the people at HA9 want you to drop by. You want to work there? Yeah, I told them! They remembered... You're an intern? Yes. I can't go into detail yet, but I'm working on a team now. For real? Wow! Want to go tomorrow? Huh? Yeah! You'll come too? I don't think so. You'll really go? I want to. Won't you? Why would I? They suck. Sorao! These tacos are awesome. Glad to hear it. Enjoy. Yeah. Let's eat! Sorao, what do you recommend? "Midsummer Regret," perhaps? Get over yourself. You're not doing anything! Standing up is hard enough! Don't lean on me! That take was okay! Next is a closeup of Haruko's hands! Haruko, be aggressive. Aggressive. Don't produce me! Good. More! Shut up! Whoa.. Next is Tomoyo sharpening a knife, for atmosphere. What a weird atmosphere... "Japanese aesthetics," or something. This is all about nurturing creativity. Oh, you don't say? Tomoyo does minor stuff like this too? This is a big production streamed to 135 countries. World's End Cooking, Season 4. No way! I never miss an episode! Very sorry! Those flowers aren't cutting it. Better without purple? Like this? Or this? Sorry. Plastic flowers are a no-go. Um... so... the thing is.. Tomoyo, how are these? Perfect! Yes! "One day until deadline" Oh, thanks! Looks great. Bless this food. Really good. It is. The crew were so pleased. Glad to hear it. I thought it was a facade. You look impressive on TV, but I thought it'd all be fake. Sorry. I wanted you to be that way. But... I realized when I walked into your restaurant. "Wow, I love this place." I could see why others love it too. What? Back back back. I'm okay, I'm okay. I'll sit when I'm ready. I'll do it slowly. I can do it. Lucky Yuko's not here. Why is that lucky? I can't let her see me look pathetic. Honestly, I haven't spoken properly with her for six months. I thought so. I didn't want to argue. That's just silly. I just can't figure her out lately. Lately, Yuko went to a party in Tokyo. What's that? See? She looks grown-up. Because she's growing up. Cute, right? It suits her. Is that her dress? I lent it to her. Sorry. You came to work, but I was too busy. No, it's fine, really. On today of all days, I really messed up. Yeah, I felt bad for you. It was my fault, but they fixed it for me. Oh.. Well, they're pros. They tell me I'm part of their team too, but I'm totally not. I'm a high schooler. So I got sent home. I say I'm an intern, but this is reality. You're amazing. You edited images. And bought takeout coffee. You did your best. I did tasks anybody could do. But it's impressive. You worked with grownups. I want to grow up. You were crying.. Wait, what? Wipe your tears. This is... Oh! My lunchbox wrapper. Smells of tacos? A little. Wouldn't a handkerchief be more normal? Normally. Thanks. I want medicine to speed up time. Freaky medicine. You swallow it, and five years go by. Five years for you only? Yeah. And the world? That's a good question. Let me think it over for homework. Five years, huh.. Yuko, what do you want to be? Hmm, you're asking me now? I want to know. That'll be my homework. I'd better go. See you. Hey... Don't tell Akane anything, okay? I won't, I won't. It was just a joke. Okay, see you at school. Bye bye. You didn't submit it?! Well, the other bands were way too good. Real pros. Our song would just get slammed by fans. We'd get known in a way we don't want. If we get known, who cares what we want? We won't know till we submit it. She's right. Are you outta your mind? We put our hearts into it. I don't want it criticized. That's not for you to decide. Sorry. Ready to order? Hah-chan rice for two. With drinks? Beer. Thank you. One moment please. Two Hah-chans, two beers! Okay, two Hah-chans! Hello! Please sit at the back. Don't tell me... I threw my back out. Kosuke! Table 6's order. Thank you for waiting! Kosuke! Register please. Yudai, where's Yuko? She hasn't come. You know something. I don't. Really? I don't! Really... "Akane: Where are you?" So, you're not really sick? Sorry. Problem with your internship? No. I'm glad I went. I learned how pros work. You only went once. So what? You didn't go so you don't know. And, I realized. Prep school's not for me. Doing art for exams is no fun. Are you serious? I don't need art college either. You're right. You joined a band, and became an intern. Lots of escape routes. They're not. You're scared of criticism. "It doesn't feel right" is just an excuse. Our zine too. You haven't done it for days. I've been busy. Prep school was Mom's idea? No! I've only got art college. "Chocolate Sleepover comeback concert Today 7 p.m." Okay, I'll head home now. Tomoyo should be back from hospital soon. Got it. Thanks. Haruko, are you really leaving?! After I say goodbye to Tomoyo. Oh heck... Oh heckity heck... Come on, I can't stay forever. But Tomoyo's a lot happier with you here! Without you, our lives'll be empty! Thanks. I'll be back. Alright. Thank you so much.. Prep school? I quit. Our song? Didn't send it. Oh right. Sorry I can't take you to the show. I'm back... I took a look inside. Relics of our misspent youth. They're ours, so I kept them all this time. No wonder you wrecked your back. This is so cringey. That unit we formed together. The Pens! So lame! We didn't care. Our unofficial Chocolate Sleepover special. Those were the days. Oh, their show's today. I don't want to see old Recman. Me neither! And this is the cringiest of all. We're back again this week! The Pens on the Radio! I'm your host, Haruko! And I'm Tomoyo! Hi! I can't, I can't! It's hard to bear! So young and so dumb. But that was us then, and now we're us now. True. Give us an update. I've been writing a magazine column, and drawing illustrations. I've also started designing recently. Flyers, and t-shirts as well. I'm producing 24 hours a day! Wow, creative! I'm also busy hunting down cool places and talking to cool people! I can never let Yuko hear this. I'll take it to the grave. What? I just sent it to her. But Tomoyo, aren't you taking on way too much? Am I too fickle? Mom? But I try everything wholeheartedly. Always full throttle! That's you! Right? I'm consistent about being inconsistent. So, industry people, come and find me! Hear that? I'm right here waiting! Can you hear me?! Want one? I want one. Tell us your ambitions. First, I'll open a swanky restaurant with my pal Haruko. Then what? A regular column. Then what? Marriage, for example Hard to imagine. Kids? Even harder to imagine. I'm not cut out to be a mom. How do you know? What kind of mom would you want to be? Me? I don't know. I want to be an admirable woman, with a career, media and political insight, and fashion sense. You're so self-absorbed! I'd love it if my child thought, "My mom's so cool." And I'd hug them really tightly. That's a good mom. Okay, say a message to your future child. Huh? A message? Hey, let's go to a song! You coward! Chocolate Sleepover's "This won't Do"! Riku! I asked you to knock. When a cool mother shows her immature and lame side, it gives their child hope. Hey! You came after all! I was hoping to listen inside, not outside. Yo. Yo my butt. Sorry. Sorry isn't enough, but... I guess we can't hear it out here. My mom... isn't as perfect as I thought. She's fickle too. Even so, she fought her own battles. She always took her best shot. So, even if something feels inadequate and lame, you should put it out there... I think. I'm sure. I want to. I want to try again with all of you. I do. The deadline's passed. The concert's nearly over too. You're a lost cause. Say it. Say it. Hurry. Also, Yuko.. Would you sing lead this time? Well, your voice is perfect for the song's image... You're late! Sorry, sorry. Okay, let's do this. I like it! But, if we're changing the lyrics, will it still be a cover? Who cares? Let's make what we want. Agreed! This needs to be one or the other. Yeah, it's important... Don't do that! Let's get outta here! It's okay! It's okay! Here goes. My eyes, my eyes.. Dad?! You guys inspired me to play again. My eyes, my eyes... That was scary. I thought my heart'd stop. Look. The plan for our own restaurant. We put so much thought into what we wanted to do. We talked for ages. This is nothing like it. Nothing like it. Tomoyo. I'm sorry... I didn't go that day. We did so much preparation together, but... You didn't come to look at the premises. Back then... I chickened out. Okay, let's do it. All good? Yeah. I'm ready. Okay here too! Recording. That time I said bye bye I remember I just can't help regretting I hid my sadness and said bye bye Truth is, fear's what I was feeling I've regretted that so much. If I'd stuck by you back then, I'd be doing it with you now. I thought that sometimes. What's gonna be our future? Adults don't know either Ghosts are what we'll become Nobody's alarm is turned on Won't you let me see how this all turns out? Still.. This isn't the future I imagined, but it's grown on me. I'm not bluffing. Yeah. I know. Maybe I'll open a restaurant. I always wanted to. Great idea. Never too late, right? You bet. Hey, I can't drink now! Okay, cheers! Cheers. I'll upload it. It's up. I've got butterflies. Any comments yet? Not yet, surely. Probably not. I'm so nervous! Hope it gets lots of plays. Bye bye. Take care. Okay, see you. Hey... Want to walk the long way listening to this? Oh, sorry. There's something I need to finish. I'd better go. Don't! No getting away. I can't! Come on, a message to your child! Well... Well... I haven't got any message! But, but... Whatever you're going through there, whomever you've met, tell me when you get back. Let's talk. The End! The End! Cut! Okay! Ready, go! I like making art after all, even though I suck, and our teacher sucks. This summer, I wanted to find one thing I could stick with, but there's more than one. Like the band, and YouTube. You praised my writing, so I'll do that too. I'll do it all! And maybe more. Greedy. I did want to be an intern. You did? I envied how you try without hesitating. Akane, bet I can hold my breath longer. No thanks. Come on! Ready, go! I want to talk with my mom so much. Good for you. About what? About my new friend. I brought my homework. I can't help wanting to be something different every day. I used to hate myself a lot for that, but now I know for sure it's okay. So, Yudai Seo. See you in a few years' time. I'll be cooler then. Why say my full name? You'll see me at the exam venue? Bye bye. Thank you so much. All the best. Yuko, come back sometime. Haruko.. Give my best to Tomoyo. I will. Thank you too, Riku. Summer is ending. I'll keep doing my homework. I might have to make a choice one day, but for now I choose not to. Listened to the demo? Yeah, it could use some more work... What do you know? It's brilliant! Shut up, you. It's the best! No fighting. Sure, thank you. Two Hah-chan rice, one noodle salad! Coming! Here he comes.. There! The Taco Kid! Hope he gets popular. Now then.. Bless this food. AROUND THE TABLE 3, 2, 1! That time I said bye bye I remember I just can't help regretting I hid my melancholy and said bye bye Truth is, fear's what I was feeling Oh, is it normal for this to come on so suddenly? When exactly did it all begin? Has it really begun? What's gonna be our future? Adults don't know either Ghosts are what we'll become Nobody's alarm is turned on Won't you let me see how this all turns out? It started with Riku's "Knock knock" My dream goes tick tock Changing, chopping Like a beat that rocks We're way past deadline But we smile just fine Determined, we've become Right now's the most fun Something shined far away I saw it through the haze Let's take that direction Singing and progressing Ready? Feeling steady? One session only Let's play freely If that ghost is bored Let's jump in, all aboard Oh, is it normal for this to come on so suddenly? When exactly did it all begin? Has it really begun? What's gonna be our future? Adults don't know either Ghosts are what we'll become Nobody's alarm is turned on Won't you let me see how this all turns out?
