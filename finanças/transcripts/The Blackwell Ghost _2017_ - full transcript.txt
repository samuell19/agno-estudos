- [Host] My high school journalism teacher once told me, "A good journalist could make "the most boring subject entertaining." That stuck with me. But in the end, just seemed like too much work. My entire career is consisted of producing and directing zombie movies, an easy subject to make entertaining. But now, I'm ready for a challenge. A challenge that my teacher would be proud of and that is to prove that ghosts exist. For those haters out there that think this is fake, I'll stop you right there. I was the furthest thing from a believer in the supernatural up until about a year ago. Since then, I found that if you look in the right places, the dark corners of your house, the reflections of an off-television, you can be amazed at what you will see. - [Tommy] (mumbles) hear screaming coming from that room. - [John] Yeah, I hear it too. (eerie music) (cars honking) (cars revving) - Tell you what, it's starting to get cold outside. There's nothin' like a cup of coffee in the cold. Ooh, winter's coming. (slurps) Ooh, fuck. Kentucky's always been home to me. I moved to California about 10 years ago, shortly after high school. Did the whole movie thing, had a lot of fun, but I just had to come back because I missed the winter. I miss Kentucky, it's a good state. So now that I've been in Kentucky, I've been tryin' to find out what kind of project I'm gonna do. I've been debating another zombie movie or this intriguing ghost venture. It's embarrassing when I have to go downstairs and tell my mom that I'm a ghost hunter. (sighs) Oh God, lemme get my phone here. If you guys haven't seen this video goin' around on YouTube, you're probably one of the few people who hasn't seen it. The reason it's kinda intriguing me is 'cause the guy that made the video reached out to me just recently and my first question was why? But then I found out we have a mutual friend through Facebook, so I figured out I would start there. Hey, I'm gonna go. - My stepbrother's (mumbles) - Do you want a coffee or is that all mine? - It's all you. - Well I just wanna take this moment before I make this phone call to apologize to my journalism teacher because this is absolutely the most embarrassing thing I'm about to do. I'm about to call this guy and ask him if he thinks ghosts are real. I don't know why this just feels really embarrassing. You know, you try to do a fucking documentary and your fucking piece of shit tablet from ??? wants to poop the bed right the fucking last second. I'm gonna throw you down. Settin' up camera angle two. Alright, we're gonna call this guy. Call check, audio check, good. Got a fuckin' balding head, it's terrible. (phone ringing) - [John] Hello? - Hey, is this John? - [John] Oh hey, how's it goin'? Tommy said you might call today. - Yeah, I can't believe you worked with Tommy. So I didn't ask him, did he work at the hotel with you or where did you guys work together? - [John] No, we used to work at the restaurant together. - So as you know, I'm doing a documentary on ghosts, as I told you on the internet. I had no idea who you were or that you were responsible for that video, but I actually saw the video organically so I think it's pretty interesting that now I'm talkin' to you, the person that was in it. Please don't take offense by this, but I think that the video is fake. I just wanted to hear from the guy who posted it because now that I'm doin' this documentary, it would save me a potential a lot of time if the person in the video just came forward and told me no this is fake, this never happened. - [John] I totally understand and everyone automatically thinks someone put this video together and that it's fake. I mean, why would you think it's real? It shows a ghost; there's no logic to it. Well the truth (mumbles) lies in the fact that anybody who knows me could tell you that I'm simply incapable of pulling stuff like this off. - It is funny you're sayin' that 'cause that was one of the first things Tommy told me about you was that you are technically not advanced and probably couldn't pull something like this off. He said you could barely turn on a computer let alone post something like this on a screen. (chuckles) Sorry. - [John] Unfortunately that's true. (mumbles) a year ago, it's true. I couldn't make this thing-- - Well it just seems like a bunch of visual effects to me and I would appreciate it if you just told me straight up no, this was somethin' me and my friend did or whatever. - [John] I don't know what you want me to say, all I can tell you is what I know. I can totally understand that people will do a video of a ghost and automatically they think it's fake because they don't know any other way to justify it. This is a real video. It came straight from our machine, yet people still think it's fake. The public is always gonna think it's fake even if it's real. - That makes sense actually. Tell Tommy I said hello and I appreciate your time. You'll hear from me in about a week, is that cool? - [John] That's perfectly fine. - Alright John, I appreciate it. - Anytime. - Alright, see ya. - Bye bye. - Bye. (eerie music) (hail crashing) (car revving) - [Voicemail] No one is available to take your call, please leave a message after the tone. (beeps) - I'm callin' you again, can you just gimme a call back whenever you get a chance please? Thanks. So I've left 10 messages with John. Somethin's goin' on, I don't know what it is but it's not good for me because I'm makin' a documentary and I need him. But apparently he's takin' a new job and doesn't wanna mess that up, so he doesn't wanna be in this documentary which I understand but the least you could do is just tell me that. So here I am stuck, tryin' to produce this ghost documentary and I have nothing. I had this, now I have nothing. (sighs) I don't know what to do, I guess I'm gonna quit. I hate quitin' but I don't really have a choice and probably go back to makin' zombie movies, I guess. I'm not even really good at that, so I'm kinda screwed. (chuckles) So I just found my camera, it was in my basement. You can see my basement back there. I decided to turn this thing back on because I got new interesting lead for my documentary. When I put myself on a forum lookin' for ghost footage, I was approached by a lot of people that had ghost footage. But as you would probably guess, most of it was just complete bullshit. One actually stuck out to me enough to make me turn the camera back on, so that's what I'm doin'. So I'm just gonna show you guys a video that was sent to me that got me so intrigued. I'm gonna play it for you guys. This is from a guy named Greg up in Pennsylvania, South Lake. (light clicking) That's pretty much it. Now I know a bunch of people are sittin' there sayin' you're kiddin', right? I get it because you may not have seen what I just saw. That's why I'm here, gonna zoom in and show you different things that I noticed about this video. First of all, you see a lamp turn on by itself. Here, I'll play it back for you. So the lamp... Oh, I need to put some time code on this because this shows what time. It's apparently 1:06 in the morning when all of a sudden the lamp turns on by itself. Everyone out there is probably like oh whoop-de-doo, that's not a big deal. 15 seconds later, the lamp turns off. Big whoop, right? See, there it goes. So you watch it and you don't think anything of it, until I played it back and looked a little bit closer. Watch what happens right after the lamp goes off. Right there. So I'm gonna rewind it and I'm gonna zoom in. Yeah, I gotta brighten this up for y'all real quick. You can definitely see whatever is crossin' that thing. I know you're probably sayin', "Oh my God, this is just stupid." But you gotta remember, I'm just a real guy watching this. You might be right, it might not be anything but I'm doin' a ghost documentary and this is actually pretty exciting. (pants) I'm about to call this guy and see if I can't come up to his house maybe as soon as today. We'll see what happens, probably a bunch of bullshit but (chuckles). I ain't got nothin' else better to do. I was in Lexington, Kentucky. We actually have a plane and we can fly up. There's a little airport just up from your house. Oh no, that'd be great if you're not doing anything. We could be up there in a few hours. Alright, well thanks Greg. Alright, bye. I'm goin' to Pennsylvania today. - [Terri] How far is that? - Three hours. - [Terri] Am I going? Assuming I'm going. - What are you doin' today? Clear (mumbles). (plane engine roaring) (muffled radio chatter) As soon as we takeoff, it's gonna get a lot cooler here. - Okay. - (mumbles) Put on my flyin' hat. How does that look? (muffled radio chatter) (plane engine roaring) (mumbles) today and see if (mumbles). See if this Greg guy is full of shit or not, which I think he is. Regardless, it's a nice day to take the plane out. It's only a couple hours out of the way. Thank you. Here, will you take the camera? Did I show you a picture of the house? I didn't see it when we drove up. It's that way. Hold on, no it's that way. Let's go. No, (chuckles) I'm sorry it's this way. Do you see it? Can you see it? - Yeah. - Okay. (truck roaring) It looks creepy, doesn't it? A little bit. I just wanna let him know that we're here. (laughs) Hey. - Well hello. - We finally made it up here. - I hope you had a good trip. - Yeah, we did. This is my wife, Terri. She just gonna kinda film-- - Hi, it's nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. - [Host] She's gonna kinda film us if you don't mind. - Yeah come on in, that's what you're here for. - [Host] Cool, thank you. - This is it, you may recognize it from the video footage I sent to you. - I do, so this is the living room I'm guessing? - Yes, this is the living room. - Cool, is that the camera over there? - Right there on the mantle, it sure is. - That's a little bitty camera. Is that a security camera? - It is and it's got great quality. It works well for all sorts of things. - Yeah, this little thing is what shot the video that you sent me. - It is. - That right there? - It sure is. - That's pretty cool. You have a nice house here. - Well thanks very much, I've really enjoyed living here over the years. - How long have you lived here? - My dad bought the house in 1965, I wanna say. I guess about 50 years I've been living here. - So you claim that this house is haunted. How often would you say that you see activity if anything? - I'd have to say every day or at least every other day, I've seen some activity. - [Host] You see that much? - Yeah, it's quite a bit. - Well gimme an example. Like when's the last time you saw 'em? - A couple nights ago, I could hear the kitchen cabinets opening and closing, so I thought if there's anybody in the house. I come down here and there was nobody here. - That happens that often? - Yeah, pretty much every day or at least every other day. - You think we'll see somethin' while we're filming? - I would not be surprised. It's very, very possible. - So Greg, do you know if anybody's died in this house since, I guess, maybe before you lived here? - While I was here, both my parents died. - Oh really? - Yeah. - I'm sorry. - It's been a while ago. - At the same time? - No, not at the same time. My dad died when I was just a kid. He fell down the stairs and broke his neck. He was just gone instantaneously. - Down the main staircase? - Yeah, the main staircase. Then my mom died eight years ago which was a little shocking to us. - Why was it shocking, what happened? - With my mom, she was so healthy. In fact, she had just seen the doctor the day before and he had told her how great her health was and what good shape her heart was in. Here she is one night up in the guest bedroom and it's a heart attack. I just didn't know if she had seen something that scared her or-- - [Host] What do you mean, like a ghost? - It could be that it was trying to rationalize her death by thinking something like that. - What about your mom, did she believe in ghosts? Did she believe that this house was haunted? - Oh yeah, we all knew. I remember one summer it was so hot, we had all the doors in the house open. I think there are like about 10. (claps) Boom, all the doors slammed shut at once. There was no way that could have been the wind and they were all at different angles. That scared the heck out of us. - [Host] So you're saying every door in the house slammed shut-- - Every door in the house slammed shut at the same exact moment. It was spooky. Alright this was the kitchen we were just in. We started here in the living room and this is the main staircase, right here. This is the master bedroom. Sorry about the fumes I just painted it a couple days ago. - It's not that bad. Well it's a nice bedroom. - Well thanks. This morning's ghostly activity, not really much happens in here. It's kind of a strange thing. It seems like the entity respects my privacy for some reason. - (chuckles) Who would've thought that? You're sayin' it doesn't come in here, is that what you're sayin'? - I don't think so. However, that doesn't mean it doesn't mess with me. If you will come back out here, I'll show you what it does. - Okay, sure. - Something you may have noticed when we came up here was how much noise the floor makes. Did you notice that? - I didn't, I wasn't payin' attention, sorry. - Alright, well let me show you. - Okay. (stairs creaking) - Almost every night when I'm trying to sleep, I hear that very series of noises. - Wow. - And then, it's as if the entity is just stopping right here and saying that it wants to play or something. Nothing happens after that, but it's still darn frightening I tell ya. - You never hear it walk away or anything, it just stays there? - No, it just stays there all night long. - That is creepy. - It still frightens me, I have to say after all these years. This one time I had some out-of-town friends spend the night here in the guestroom; the next morning we were at breakfast and they said, "Greg, why were you going "up and down the stairs all night long?" I didn't have the heart to tell them that it wasn't me, it was the entity. I couldn't tell them it was a ghost, it wasn't me. - [Host] So they heard it that clearly? - Oh, they heard it. - Really? - They were (mumbles) a weekend and a number of times there in the evening. - It's probably good you didn't tell 'em what it actually was. - Yeah they'd never be back. I'd never see them again. - It's like a music studio in here. - Yeah I do a little bit of everything. Alright now this room is very interesting because a couple years ago I was out of town on business, as I often am, and my neighbor across the street over there, Ron, gives me a call and says, "Hey Greg, I thought you were outta town." I said, "Ron, what's up?" He goes, "All the lights in your house are on "and there's somebody standing by the window." It actually so convinced him that he calls the cops. - Really? - Yeah yeah yeah. The cops show up and by the time they get there, everything's back to normal. The lights are off and nobody by the window. Ron is really a straight shooter, he's like a no bullshit kinda guy. I take whatever he says as being truthful. He would've not made that up. What I'm about to show you may make you wanna run under this house screaming. You have to promise me, both of you, that you're not gonna do that alright? - Okay, I promise. (chuckles) - Promise. - Promise. - Alright, off to the basement. - Okay we'll follow you then. - Okay here we go. Watch your step. (eerie music) - [Host] This is kinda creepy. - Yeah it is. So as you can see, it's a dark and scary basement. Would you agree? - I couldn't disagree with ya. - (chuckles) Can you tell me if either of you have seen anything like this before? - What's that? - This. Have you ever seen something like this before? - [Host] Well it says storm sewer on it. - No it's not, it's actually a well. It used to serve as the houses' main source of water. - You're kiddin' me. - No. This is not the kind of thing you find in the basement of a home. But yet, every home in this neighborhood has one. So this basement and this well have a particular story both. - Please, please tell me what the story is. - The house was built around 1930. The gentleman who built the house had a wife who was a little on the psycho side. To make a long story short, children in the neighborhood started going missing. The neighbors suspected this woman because she was so strange. - Wow. - When they investigated, they found that the children had been chopped up and their bodies disposed of in this well. - In this thing? - In this, right here in this basement. - You're kiddin' me. - No and the thing is there's really been no evidence of that. I can't really find any hard evidence, but you have to wonder how something like that ever got started if there wasn't some basis and truth. - What is this thing, what is that? - Well, that's our only way to access this. This thing weighs about as much as a house. If (mumbles) down, it'll take a special tool to lift it. We leave those pliers stuck in there just to be able to take the lid off if ever that were necessary. Every house in the neighborhood has one, but we did install the cap there to keep odors and other rodents, that sort of thing out. - [Host] But you're saying if we took that top off, right there, you'd be able to see well water? - Yeah, it's quite deep; probably 20 or 30 feet down in the ground. - That is creepy. - It's spooky. - [Host] Well I appreciate it, Greg I really do. - Glad you guys could come here. - I appreciate your help. - I wish you all the luck on your project. - Yeah, I guess we got a three hour plane trip back home. - Well, safe travels. - Thanks again. - Good to meet you both. - Okay. (eerie music) Dear? - What? - [Host] Can I read you an email? - Is this how you're going to read me the email? - So I got an email from Greg and it involves us. - Okay? - You might not like this. "Really nice meeting you and your wife. "Glad you could make it down here "and I really think it's cool you flew your own plane. "As I told you I'm going out of the country "for a couple months and wanted to offer you "the opportunity to stay in my home while I'm away. "I know that you were doing a documentary about ghosts "and I just feel as though if you were to spend one night, "you would realize that I'm being honest about everything. "Either way, it's up to you. "Please feel free to gimme a call in the morning, "it would be my pleasure." It might be three nights. - Okay. - In a haunted house. - Oh. - Guess what? He's even lettin' us use his car. - Well that is very nice of him. - [Host] It's a free vacation, you can't get (mumbles). You're always sayin' that-- - Woohoo, I always wanted to go to Nowhere, Pennsylvania. And when are we going? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Yeah, that's my extra coat. - Okay. Alright, let's go. (plane engine roaring) He says he put the keys over by the window. (birds chirping) Alright, kinda weird isn't it? - [Terri] What? - That we're in somebody else's house. Home sweet home. This is weird. Well, you wanna look around? Did you get a good look last time we came? - [Terri] Yeah. - So we're in the kitchen. This is the kitchen. This is the dining room. This is the living room. This little camera right here filmed that and got the ghost right there. You wanna just stay down here? - For what? - Where are ya? - I'm in the kitchen. - Ooh okay. We're gonna go upstairs. Bathroom, this is the bathroom. This is the guest bedroom here. This is where his mom died. You feel at home yet? - I mean, it's nice. - [Host] He's got a cool office. Front window. (sighs) And you know what the weirdest part is? - [Terri] What's that? - The weirdest part for me is gonna be sleepin' in someone else's bed. It's different from a hotel room because you're sleepin' on somebody's home bed. - Mm-hmm. So far, not much activity going on. - What about that Jesus up there? Let's go down to the basement. Terri, will you go down with me? - [Terri] Yeah. - Thanks. - Is it because you're scared? - No! Don't fuckin' lock me in here. Dude, this place is creepy. Yeah, this place is creepy. They don't build foundations like this anymore. That is pure rock. I don't think you heard what he said about that, did you? No he said that somebody put bodies down that thing. Do you believe him? - I don't know. People put bodies in weird places, it's not abnormal. They do! - (chuckles) You've been watchin' 24 Hour Mystery. - Well, what are you watching, Paranormal Activities? - Yeah. Well I'm gonna get some cameras set up. - [Terri] Okay. - Will you help me? - Yup. - I'm gonna get some cameras set up in this creepy old house. You gonna help? - Yes. - I love you. There was somethin' else I was gonna say. I think he-- (floor creaking) That's weird. Oh, would you turn that light off real quick? - [Terri] Yeah. - Thing's behind that thing. Thanks. When you read about huntin' ghosts, you figure out ways to capture 'em. This probably won't work, but we'll see. - [Terri] Does it have to be one ply or two ply? - Just, be quiet. - [Terri] This is very fascinating. Can you have it printed, like colored toilet paper? - Just stop. So I'll take the ball and I'll put it right in the middle, like that. This camera is gonna be positioned to get this. The gist of it is if there is a ghost in this room, I read, on the internet, that ghosts are kinda like boys in the fact that if they see a ball, they kinda wanna move it. So that's what this is. I would kick the shit outta that. - Do you want to right now? - I kinda do. So I just downloaded and installed an app that's in charge of this house's security system. It's also in charge of the camera that's on the shelf over here. So at any given time, we can see a feed from this camera, which will ultimately get that view, if that makes sense. It's pretty neat. These are our night vision cameras. So that's our night vision light. That's a modified GoPro. It's gettin' pretty late. - [Terri] Hmm? - I'm talkin' to the camera. Gotta make sure all the cameras are on. Here's the livin' room. We got our X, cameras are on over there. Wow, it's so windy. (wind howling) It's crazy to think it's like 40 degrees out here and it could actually rain tonight. What a weird State. - Oh my God. No, go away! (Host laughing) - Alright, we're goin' to bed. It's about, what time is it? - [Terri] I don't know, 10? - 10, 11 o'clock. It's pathetic I'm goin' to bed that early. (chuckles) This is the camera-- - Set it? - I'm about to set it, it records all night. It's gonna get us in bed and we got every camera in the house out here rollin' on continuous record, so if we see anything, if anything happens, we're gonna capture it. Goodnight, wish us luck. Wish us luck, Terri. - Oh, good luck. - She doesn't care about this. (laughs) (eerie music) (light clicking) (Host groaning) - What? - Will you make coffee? - Mm-hmm. - Please? - Oh my God! (Host laughing) Hey, did you leave the basement door open? - What? Well we made it through night one, no apparent evidence that this house is haunted. As you can see the ball is still right where we left it. But there is an interesting detail and that is when we woke up this mornin', that door was wide open. That's a little creepy and I don't have a camera on it. So shit. I didn't even see if it was shut last night. Was it shut? - [Terri] I don't know. I have no idea. - I wanna see if this latches real quick. Yeah, I mean if it was cracked like that, I could see it swinging open. (wind howling) Is that microphone on? I gotta make sure the... Will you stop movin'? (Terri laughing) (laughs) I gotta make sure the light comes on. Alright, come on into here in the living room. What we're gonna do is, this is a 16 millimeter film camera. I've read on the internet if you start filmin' stuff in low-light situations that somethin' will possibly show up when this thing is mailed off. The film has to be mailed off. From there, we'll analyze it and see if we see anything in the grainy film. I haven't shot 16 mill since I was in film school. What, is that nerdy? My wife's lookin' at me like you're an idiot. So we're gonna shoot 24 frames per second. We're gonna start with the angle from this thing. Here, show 'em that view over there. (eerie music) (camera shuttering) Shot a little film, we'll see how that turns out later. I'm gonna go ahead and film some other stuff around the house. - Stop! (Host chuckling) - What? Huh? - [Terri] Nothing. (camera shuttering) (eerie music) (camera shuttering) (camera shuttering) - This isn't the night vision light. No, it's not. (camera shuttering) I think that-- (floor creaking) I keep on hearing things down here. - [Terri] It's an old house. - Yeah but you didn't hear that, just then? - [Terri] Old houses make noise. Our house makes noises. - I just wonder if that's my brain playin' tricks on me or if it's actually somethin'. - [Terri] I wonder if you're losing your mind. - [Host] I'm gonna turn the lights on before I have a heart attack. - [Terri] Alright. (feet stomping) - You heard that, though. Alright, we're comin' to the end of night two. I think we're gonna go to bed. We didn't see as much as we thought we would, so it's kinda disappointing. To say the least, I think we're both kinda happy to be goin' home. Terri, are you ready to go home? - [Terri] Yes. - It looks like I failed at yet another venture. This documentary is probably gonna suck. This house may be haunted, but I don't think it is. Nothin' can prove otherwise so far because we have that much evidence. I forgot I have to... We have to set up the GoPros. Not the GoPro, we have to set up the night vision cameras. - Uh huh. - Will you help me with that? It's our last night, it's the least we can do, right? - [Terri] Mmhmm. - I'll go downstairs and get 'em. (eerie music) (stairs creaking) (loud banging) (smoke alarm beeping) Stay here, alright? Oh shit, oh shit. Terri, call the fire department right now. Call the fire department right now, there's a fire downstairs. Jesus. - [Terri] My God, where is that coming from? - [Host] Oh shit. (door banging) Hey, turn the smoke alarm off. - The smoke alarm? - Yeah. Can you turn it off with your phone? Where are you? - [Terri] I'm right here! - [Host] Open up some windows, there's smoke everywhere down here. Shit. Did you open up the window? - [Terri] Yes. (door slamming) (eerie music) - [Host] Oh shit. - What was that? - Oh shit. (panting) - [Terri] What? Can we stop-- - Did you come downstairs? - [Terri] No, why are you still filming? - [Host] Holy shit, dude. - [Terri] What, what is going on? - [Host] Holy shit. - [Terri] What? - Dude, I am fucking freaking out. Gimme the phone, we gotta call the police back. Fuck! Hi, hello. My wife just called, we're stayin' at... Yeah, my wife just called. Can you fuckin' hear me? We gotta get a new fuckin' phone. There's no fire, so you don't need to necessarily send a fire truck. Thank you, thank you so much. Alright, bye. You're not gonna believe... Would you turn that off? Shit. (numbers dialing) - [Librarian] Good morning. - Good mornin', I had a question. I'm looking for a... This is a strange question. I'm lookin' for an old newspaper from approximately the 1940s and I just wanna see who I would talk to about gettin' a copy of that. - [Librarian] That would be a question for archiving. I'll transfer you real quick, okay? - So in case you guys don't know what a microfilm is back in the day, they used to take every newspaper and take a snapshot picture of it then archive it. - [Woman] They are actually up in Google now and the (mumbles) microfilms are included as well. - Oh really? - [Woman] Was there a specific day of the newspaper you have to find? - I'd like everything you got from 1938 to 1942. Let's say 1942, anything local would work. You can just email those to me right now? - [Woman] Yes I can. - That is awesome. 365 times three equals 1,095 newspapers per year times, what'd I say? Four years, that's 4,380 newspapers. (sighs) Well this is gonna be interesting. I've been looking through microfilm newspapers for about almost three hours now and I finally found it. Imma have to do a split screen on this. So here's the negative of the newspaper dated March 21st, 1941. You can see a picture of a house right here. When I first saw it I was like that kinda looks like this house, but I can't be certain. So I brought it into Photoshop and inverted it to make it look normal. There is absolutely no denying that the house in the picture is the house I'm currently in right now. Which is creepy when it's associated with the article that's written about it. (sighs) Oh God, I'm just kinda freakin' out because like I'm lookin' at a photograph, 1941, of this house, I point to this window and that's the very window right here. This is this window right here. That's the same window. Now, here's the interesting part. This story is similar to what Greg said and he said that there's a woman that killed seven people in this house. I was just like whatever at first, but now this article's like backin' that up. It's truth. So I read the whole article and the scariest part for me was comin' back and noticing that there was a second picture associated with the article. Are you guys ready for this? Meet Ruth Blackwell, the crazy lady who killed seven kids and disposed of their bodies. Used to live in this house, used to roam this same room I'm sure. This documentary that I thought was kind of a joke, is actually taken a very interesting turn. Terri's at the store right now. She doesn't know that I found this article, so I'm kinda keepin' it a secret. I told Terri we're gonna stay one more night and then we're goin' home tomorrow mornin'. I'm kinda scared to stay the night here. For the documentary, I'm gonna do it I guess. (eerie music) (wind howling) God, this thing weighs a fuckin' ton. (Host groaning) (well lid grinding) (Host coughing sickly) Oh, this thing stinks. Oh God! (breathes heavily) I found the source of the bad smell. Oh God, here. That doesn't look like spring water to me. I'm gonna take this string and see how far it'll go. If it'll even go down. Then when I pull it all back up, I'm gonna measure it. See if I can't get a depth. I could tell this thing goes pretty deep. Let's see if I can't show it to you on here. I got that string, that string musta gone down 60 feet. But it's just creepy, it's creepy to think this little hole right here is where she dumped those... (panting) I think this is a bad idea 'cause I can't breathe. I gotta go back up. (Host panting and groaning) (well lid grinding) (well lid slamming) (leaves rustling) (wind howling) (thunder rumbling) This storm is brewin' outside. I can hear the thunder comin' from really far away. It's pretty creepy. See if I can't get some weather updates. It's supposed to be a pretty big storm tonight. Possible tornado winds. Just what we need on our last night in this creepy old place. I've been havin' some equipment issues. I just need to clarify this, been havin' some equipment issues. For some reason I don't know what is causin' it, but all my cameras are dead and the batteries won't charge. I'm havin' a nightmare for a documentarian. I got these two cameras here for the night vision with extra batteries to get us through 'til morning. These things are both done. I'm not gonna show you that and the camera I'm shootin' on right now. It's not great but I gotta make it work. It's comin' into night three, we're gonna say goodnight. Still gotta set up the night vision cameras that we got. Did you hear all my cameras are dead? - No, no. - I've got two, so we gotta set up those. - Okay. - Let's go do that. Alright, we're saying goodnight for night three. Say goodnight. - Goodnight. (eerie music) (thunder rumbling) (camera buzzing) - Alright, well it's two in the mornin'. I kinda expected somethin' would happen. (Host groaning) My phone just let me know that the power to the entire house been shut down. The security alarm is ringing downstairs. - [Terri] What should we do? - (sighs) Well I can see that the power on at the neighbor's house. (sighs) Well the power be on at neighbor's house tells me that it's an issue here and it's probably the breaker box. God, I do not wanna go down there. - [Terri] Why are you so scared? It's just a storm. Alright. - Oh my God. - [Terri] Do you want me to go down and check it? - No I'll do it, just stay here. - [Terri] (chuckles) Okay. - Gimme the camera. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) Do you have your phone? - Yes. (water trickling) - [Host] Do you hear that? - [Terri] Yeah. - The faucet's on. (water trickling) If you hear me scream, will you call the police please? - Okay. - What? - Okay. - [Host] I'm serious, I'm not kiddin' you. - Why am I calling the police? - [Host] You are kidding me right now, right? I'm serious. (water trickling) (thunder rumbling) (water trickling) (water trickling) (water trickling) (thunder rumbling) Hey Terri? - [Terri] What? What? - [Host] If you hear me yell, call the police please? - [Terri] What are you yelling about? - [Host] Just, you know what? Fuck it, call the cops right now. - [Terri] And tell them what? - [Host] Just tell them to come here, please? - [Terri] Why, what is so important? - [Host] Just, Terri. I gotta go down to the basement and I really don't wanna go down there. What I just saw is enough to get the cops over here. Please call them, will you call them? - [Terri] Okay. (stairs creaking) (thunder rumbling) (light switch clicking) (water trickling) - [Host] Hey Terri, is there electricity back on? - [Terri] No. (eerie music) (Host breathing heavily) Oh shit, I can't see where I'm goin'. I can't see where I'm goin'. Holy shit, holy shit. Oh my God, oh my God. I can't fuckin' see. Oh God, goddammit. Oh God. Oh, oh shit. (door slamming) (water trickling) (feet on floor stomping) (thunder rumbling) (feet stomping) (eerie music) (Host panting) Get in, get in, get in! (door slamming) (camera buzzing) So we're about to leave the house here. We're about to go to the airport and get back on the plane. I've been thinkin' about last night and what I saw. I'm just really startin' to wonder what I should do with my footage. It's like I just discovered that leprechauns exist, but as soon as I go out and tell somebody, they're gonna wanna have me committed so that's not gonna work. I think that's where I made a big mistake because after what I've seen and experienced, there's no way anyone's gonna believe me. (sighs) I don't even care. (wind howling) (calming, serene music) You know, looking back on it all, I'm actually quite proud of myself. I think I would've made my teacher proud. But ironically I wish I had never started this venture in the first place. John said it best-- - [John] This is a real video. It came straight from our machine, yet people still think it's fake. The public is always gonna think it's fake even if it's real. - [Host] No video will ever be enough to make people believe that ghosts are real. I didn't realize at the time how right he was. So if you wanna challenge yourself as I did, do an experiment. If you know of a room or a place that scares you and you don't know why, go there. A cellar, a basement or any other dark place. Go there alone, sit in the darkness and wait for your senses to adjust. Then, begin talking to whatever may or may not be listening. Only then, you might believe me.
