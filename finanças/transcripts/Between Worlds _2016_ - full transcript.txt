"The soul chooses the parents to whom it shall be born. "For the most part, the choice is not easy but is such "as to give it the challenge for which it is returned to the world "in order for self–repair to be undertaken." – The Zohar By the sirens I hear in the background you are very close to the incident. I'm on my way there... I heard about it 5 minutes ago and I'm... Did you receive any update we haven't reported on yet or are you too getting your information from the reporters on the scene? Some of my information comes from your reporters and some from listening to the two–way radio. Go straight to the end, turn left and that'll lead you to the elevators. Third floor. Excuse me, Yoel Gilboa, where is he? Who? –The security guard from the bombing. Intensive Care, 7th floor. "And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart..." Dad, come. Yoel's been injured. He's in hospital. This is the 3 PM Newsroom broadcast. Another stabbing incident occurred an hour ago in central Jerusalem. MDA spokesman reports one person was injured & evacuated to hospital. His condition is defined as moderate to severe. The terrorist was neutralized by security guards in the area. The traffic police reports... How is he? Did they say what happened exactly? I don't know, Meir. But what did they say? Dad, let's wait until he makes it through surgery first. The operation went well. He's going into recovery now. You can be with him soon. Meir. Where are you going? Please, wait. –What? You can't leave me alone. Look at me. Can't you wait? I can't stay. You're the one who should be there when he wakes up. You're responsible for this situation. I am responsible? –It was your decision. I went along with you. I respected you. It's been four years. It's our chance. He's here. Now you want me at your side? So we'll stand next to him and pretend that nothing has changed? I just can't. You need anything? I can't find my phone. Wait... Thanks. Esty? You have my phone. Good. No, no need to. Listen, I want you to bring chocolates and balloons, thing that will make him happy when he wakes up. And come early. OK? Thanks. Thanks. –No problem. Are you here because of the bombing too? No, something else. Quick recovery. –Thank you. What about him? It's been a week and a half and no relatives have come. Talk to the social worker. His breathing is weak. Increase the volume. –OK. "Contact: Sarah. No answer" Good morning. How's he doing? They're not telling us anything. When will he wake up? We have no way of knowing at the moment. What do you mean? He's in recovery and he was supposed to have woken up by now. We hope he wakes up in the next 48 hours. Be with him in the meantime. That's most important. His Tefillin are not at home. What? –His Tefillin are not at home. That's why he left, Mom. Why do you need his Tefillin now? They can't do everything here. We need to help him. Dad. Do you know his address? Good morning. Who are you? I'm Sarah. Nice to meet you. They've been trying to reach you for a week, where were you? I'm sorry, I was out of the country. Good morning, Andrea. –Good morning, Adam'ke. How's he doing? Just like he seems, he's like this most of the time. And nothing can be done? You need to fill out some forms. If you ask me, they hear and feel everything. You should be next to him, talk to him... Let him smell fragrances. –Fragrances? Yeah, of things he liked. I'm Adam. Nice to meet you. –Nice to meet you. Try it, they say it's very helpful, all the nerves are in your feet. That's why people who are hot tempered have big feet. Really? No. He just came out of the operation. Everything's OK. Thank God. How is he? I want to see with my own eyes. What did they tell you? What's his address? Do you know where he lives? Where? He told me in Jerusalem. Why do you want to know, Meir? I know he works at the National Insurance. Where exactly? He told me but I can't remember. Do you happen to know Yoel Gilboa? Who, Yoel? Yes, the security guard who was injured here yesterday. Uli. Yes. Why are you asking? I'm his father. Oh... Man... I'm sorry. I was on the 3rd floor yesterday when it happened... how's he doing? He's doing OK, thanks. I hear visits aren't allowed yet. No, hopefully tomorrow. –One moment. Do you happen to have his address? Don't you know where he lives? I do, I just don't remember the name of the street. What's your name? Meir. I don't know, sorry. Hey Bina. How are you? Hey. How'd you know my name? You told me yesterday. Sarah. Nice to meet you. Thanks for yesterday. Are you here alone? I'm with my son. And you? My father. May he get well soon. –Thanks. How's your son doing? Hasn't woken up yet. Is he in danger? They aren't telling us anything. Did they tell you about the exercises you need to do with him? No. Want me to show you? Yes, I would love to. Know anything about it? Yes, unfortunately I've been here a week and a half with my father. How did it happen? A car accident. And he hasn't woken up yet? He'll wake up. I know he will. Sometimes God's will is hard to understand. If you can't understand why everything is related to him... we have to take responsibility over what is happening to us. Right? My son thinks so too. Are you close, you and your son? Yes. Yes? –Yes. Of course. My son. I must go back to him. Do you need help? Thank you. Where are you? (Arabic) What? How long will you keep playing this game? You want me to sit with her in the room? Not with her, with your boyfriend. How? She doesn't leave him for a second. Why are you hiding? Wait, have you even told them? Where are you going? –Come on. Come on, come on. I'll go with you. Come on. –What's with you? I can't tell them now. Trust me. Got to wait a little. Wait a little? What for? For the right moment. –For the right moment. Two years you've been saying "the right moment", when will that moment come? It'll come. What are you doing now? Playing a Mossad agent? Funny. What do you want? –You have to tell them who you are. Tell them what? I'm the Arab girlfriend of your ultra–Orthodox son? He asked me not to. What did he ask you? The most important thing for him was that his family won't know. I knew it. I have no patience for him anymore. –Will you stop it? What's wrong with you? Don't you have a heart? Amal, I just want you to be happy. I know. I'm happy. I can tell. How do you want me to look? Did you see the condition he's in? I don't even know if he'll recover. "'You surely don't mean to stick to your dull, fusty old river all your life, "'and just live in a hole on a bank, and boat? "'I want to show you the world! "'I'm going to make an animal of you, my boy!' "'I don't care,' said the Rat, doggedly. "'I'm not coming, and that's flat. "'And I am going to stick to my old river and live in a hole "'as I've always done.'" What's that book? "The Wind in the Willows", it's a book she really likes. What was she like? Not "was"... Sorry. She's full of life. After all, she's a redhead... What happened to her? It all started when she realized that we probably won't have children. I mean, naturally. We went through 7 fertility treatments. And then another miscarriage, another failure and... About two months ago, she had a heart attack. And since then she just... hasn't woken up. I'm sorry. Yes. Now at least when she wakes up I'll know that... all I need is to have her by my side. Your mother's name? –Bracha. What do the doctors say? They can't say if he'll wake up or not. It's a head injury. Is he married? –No. Does he live with you? Rabbi, I don't know where he lives. The purity of the father will bring salvation to his sons. You must do a 'Tikkun' (mend your ways). It's time for a Tikkun Esty. Maybe we should talk to him. And say what? –I don't know. Let's surround him with a happy atmosphere. Enough, Mom. –Help me. Let's read him a Psalms verse. What did you and he used to talk about? When? –I don't know, when you still spoke. Stuff. –What "stuff"? Come on, Mom, you know we haven't spoken for a long time. What's the last thing you talked about, Esty? A year and a half ago, on a Friday morning he took Oniassaf out for the day. Let's bring him here. –No way. I don't want him to see him like this. –It will make him happy. Yes, but you know how children's souls are... I don't want to. It's final. I don't want us to pretend we're a family that... OK, hush... fine. Excuse me. Excuse me. OK, take him down to have an MRI. Yes, honey? I want to transfer my dad to another room. Sorry? My dad's in room 17. I want to transfer him to 16. Why? I don't think he's comfortable being in a room with other women. Let me check. Sorry, honey, that's not possible. Why not? Because I have nowhere to transfer him to. I can get you a permit for a closed curtain. Do whatever you want, there is nothing to say. OK, I have to go, I'm taking Rivka... Bina... How is he? Thank God. But I don't know what to do anymore. What if he doesn't wake up? Bina, they hear and feel everything. It's very important to touch him. No. It's forbidden for a woman to touch a man, it's a real sin. I'm sorry, I know you mean well... I get it. But a nurse and a professional caregiver can, right? That's something else. Bina, that's exactly what we're doing. We're giving him treatment. You're right. Have you done the exercises I showed you? Not yet. Want to do them together? That's the head, so we should be gentle. The center of our feet is just like our belly. That's why it really tickles. They say that a person who has a very wide foot is usually hot tempered. Really? I need some air. Let's go outside. Where are you from? Spain. My parents were born in Spain. "Hola, mi amor". I meant, where do you live? Jerusalem. What do you do? I study music. Where? Musrara. It's a school of new music. Do you sing? May I? You can't be seen? Because of the religion? It's not prohibited, it's just... Not customary. Do you have a boyfriend? Yes. –Where's he from? Jerusalem. Does he live with you? What does he do? He's a songwriter. A songwriter? He's in moving, apartments, offices... Moving? Bina, I need to get back to my father. Meir, what's that? Who let you in here with that? I'm going to perform an atonement ceremony. What? "This is my exchange, this is my substitute, "this chicken shall go to death and we shall proceed to a good, "long life and peace. "This is my exchange, this is my substitute, "this chicken shall go to death "and we shall proceed to a good, long life and peace. "This is my exchange, this is my substitute, "this chicken shall go to death and we shall proceed to a good..." What happened? Nothing. Why are you holding the door? Is he OK? Oh no, what's that? That's what the Rabbi told me to do. What did he say? Dad... Meir, what do you plan to do with it? Leave it alone. Meir, enough! Esther! Why are you never content with anything? Look how hard he's trying! Here, these are the keys to his house. 18, Even Sapir Street. Why did you wait until now? –I didn't. You didn't? "Tefillin" What is it? We're taking him for some tests. You can rest. In what language do you expect me to talk? It's not about being ashamed. Tell them not to come. No! Excuse me, did I scare you? No, it's OK. –They just took Yoel for tests. It was my brother... –Oh... He asked about your father? I thought my family didn't care about me. I haven't seen them for almost a year. Did you have a fight? –Not really. They don't really accept my choices. Maybe you don't accept their choices either. It's another way to look at it. Right? You may be right. It's just that no one asks us to whom we want to be born. They say that the soul chooses its parents. My boyfriend told me that too. Smart. I miss him. Come sit with me in the room. Whenever you feel like. Will you come? "May it be your will, Lord our God and God of our Fathers, "to make me feel at home with Your Torah and to cling to Your commandments... "May it be your will, Lord our God... "Lord our God and God of our Fathers... "May it be your will, Lord our God and God of our Fathers "to make us feel at home with Your Torah and to cling to Your commandments..." "and to cling to Your commandments..." Continue. No, I'm just... it helps me relax. Come on in. Want some coffee? How's he doing? No change since yesterday. And I can't pray. "A prayer of the afflicted, when he fainteth, "and poureth out his complaint before the Lord. "O Lord, hear my prayer, "and let my cry come unto Thee. "Hide not Thy face from me "in the day of my distress. "Hide not Thy face from me "in the day of my distress." Meir, where are you? –Errands. I wanted you to bring something from the house. No problem, tell me what you need. OK, never mind. Bye. Can you stay here for a moment? Yes, don't worry. I'll be right back. Uli. Wake up. Wake up already. I can't believe this happened to you now. What will I tell them? You have to be with me. I love you. Meir. What's that music? What are you doing here? I found them. Who? It was here. –No. At his place. Is that what you were doing all day? If we want him back, we need to do something. That's right. Be with him, talk to him. Activate his senses. Bina, you know, there are things in the material world that can't be understood here and now. God puts signs within us. –What signs do you need? Bina, I'm trying. –What are you trying? You're not doing anything. I'm alone. What would you want me to do? –I don't know. All our lives were ruined because you didn't know and didn't do anything. Bina, I'm going to check them now and then I'll know what happened. Maybe I'm to blame, I didn't check them back when the problems with him started. Do whatever you want. –Bina! I'll be there real soon. When I heard you sing, I thought he would like to hear this. When he was 13, he begged me to buy him this CD. The day I gave it to him he ran to his room and listened to it constantly. Until Meir took it from him. Why? Because he thought he should spend his time doing other things. Close the door. Well done! Thank you. Sarah... I didn't speak truthfully. My son and I weren't close at all in the past few years. There was great anger between us and he left home and... He wasn't in touch with any of us. Why were you mad at him? He was the one who was mad at us. I don't get it. Who cut off the relationship? We made many mistakes. –So why didn't you try to do something? I tried. I looked for him everywhere. But Meir said he'd come back on his own. I didn't do anything. I just didn't do anything. You're not Baruch's daughter, are you? I am. Tell me. –I have nothing to tell. Why don't you want me to know? I can't. Why? You're lovely. You didn't tell me because you're not religious? There's no defect, Rabbi. Absolutely no defect on his Tefillin. "That which lights my life "Out of being lost, you are lost "Out of calling you and you don't answer" About two years ago, at school, I was practicing in the music room. He passed by. sat by the piano and began playing. We've been together since. You love him... Very much. Meir and I also met just as I began studying. He loved me. I thought it was the right thing. But until today, I'm not at peace with it. With what? –Leaving everything. I used to dream of having a career. That I'd go far. Why did you give it up? I thought family was most important. Bina, why don't you go rest at home tonight? You can rest assured, I'm here. "One bright morning I woke up, knowing who I was born to be. "Who are my mother and father? "I was thinking all night, at first light I was breathless" "Uli, my love, thank you for this wonderful gift. "I feel like I have won you and I know that one day "when we stop hiding our truth, we will be even happier. " "Love, Amal" You know he was close to nature. He loved animals. You know, Uli and I have a dog. Really? Niko. Tell me, has he been happy all this time? Very happy. He didn't miss us. He really missed you. It was important to him that I meet you. You're like a daughter to me. Good night. –Good night. Sarah? Sarah? Adam, this is Uli. He's that religious woman's son, right? He's my boyfriend. I'm sorry, Adam. No need to apologize. And I'm not Sarah. My name is Amal. Are you kidding me? I'm an Arab. I can tell by how far your ears are apart... You'll keep sitting next to Baruch, right? We wouldn't want the nurse to get upset. –Of course. How are Mom and Dad? Do they ask about me? Excuse me... Hello. Who are you? I'm helping to take care of him. Part of the staff here? No, I'm... I'm his girlfriend. What do you mean "girlfriend"? Girlfriend, we're together. Are you his father? Yes. Sarah. Nice to meet you. Our foremother, Sarah. A great, righteous woman. Sarah what? Elnativ. You're here... You're from Jerusalem? Yes. Where from? Pisgat Ze'ev... Not far from there. Gilo? No, it's on the other side. Since you're here, I'll go rest a bit. I heard her speaking Arabic. No way. Did you ask her who she was? She said her name's Sarah. Right, Sara, Yoel's girlfriend. Her name's Amal. How do you know? "Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, "Who has sanctified us with His commandments "and commanded us to light the Shabbat candles". Don't be afraid. It will be OK. Give me strength, merciful God. I ask not to be alone. That my family will become closer to me. That my son... will return to me. Purge all my sins and his sins, God. "...the You remember us with a beneficent memory and blessing; "that You make our households complete; "that You cause Your Presence to dwell among us. "Privilege me to raise children and grandchildren who are wise and understanding" Go away. What? Go and don't ever come back here. Bina? –Amal. Get out of here. You can't kick me out of here. I wanted to tell you. Meir. She's in here. Get out of here. –I'm not leaving. Go away. You know you shouldn't be here. I'm not going anywhere. –We'll call security. I'm not going. He needs me. Get out of here. Bina, what did I do to you? You are a liar. From day one, you've been lying to me and you... Who are you anyway? What did you want me to say? You don't accept your own son, how could you accept me? Don't answer. He chose me. He lives with me. Where have you been? You haven't been in contact with him for years. My place is here. This will never be your place. We are his family. I gave up my family for him. Don't touch him. Bina! Let go of me! Enough! Enough, Bina! I like it when you wear a white head cover. We shouldn't behave as if we're in mourning. Yes. You're right. I'll sleep here tonight. Let's go sit with him. What if he doesn't want to see us? He does. Meir, did something happen that you're not telling me about? I want to stop being afraid. "The Lord bless you and keep you, "The Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you, "lift up His (countenance) to you and give you peace." Let's go down! Come to me! When he used to call me to wish me Shabbat Shalom he'd talk about her with so much love. It's sad that she doesn't know. You didn't have to hide this from us. I'm happy you were in contact. Really. Dad, when is he going to wake up? With God's help. Thank you. Good... We can massage him. Now put him down. CPR team to the trauma room. Urgent! Look what can happen, and there is no one beside him. Enough, Bina, everything will be OK. We are doing everything we can and God will see to everything else. It will be OK. Not everything is because of us or thanks to us, Meir. It's his life... he chose how to lead them. You can't ascribe everything to God. Enough, you did what you could. It's better this way. I laughed and she didn't understand why I was laughing. It reminded me... Please come in. Meet Vicky. Where is she? She left. What do you want from me God Almighty, what do you want? I brought you some of his belongings. There's his cellphone and his wallet. Where from? Esther, she got it last week. Yes, Rabbi. The Rabbi will be here in half an hour. –What for? To change his name back to Yoel. He changed it on his ID as well. It's the last Tikkun the Rabbi said we ought to make. He doesn't need any Tikkun. Uli? Where are you? Amal?
