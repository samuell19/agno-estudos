WE GOT THIS OFF THE ARKHAM SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. Robin: POISON IVY. 2 NIGHTS AGO, GOTHAM AIRPORT, THESE 2 ARRIVED BY CHARTER FROM SOUTH AMERICA. THEY PUT 10 SECURITY GUARDS IN THE HOSPITAL, LEFT A BUSINESSMAN DEAD FROM SWALLOWING ORGANIC POISON, STOLE HIS LIMOUSINE. THIS IS DEFINITELY THE SAME PAIR THAT SPRANG FREEZE. COMMISSIONER GORDON? YES. EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN. POISON IVY--WHY WOULD SHE HELP FREEZE ESCAPE? WELL, SHE'S DEFINITELY EVIL. IT'S WEIRD. FOR AWHILE, SHE WAS ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT. I--LIKE I WAS IN LOVE, BUT-- I KNOW. AND THEN THE FEELING JUST VANISHED. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE FIGHTING OVER A BAD GUY. BAD, YES. GUY, NO. I'M TOTALLY OVER HER, ALL RIGHT? POSITIVELY. ME, TOO. DEFINITELY. GOOD STEMS, THOUGH. BUDS, TOO. YEAH, THOSE ARE NICE. HERE WE GO. [BEEPS] IT'S NORA FRIES. SHE'S STILL ALIVE. [BEEP] HE'S ADAPTED HIS FREEZING TECHNOLOGY TO REVERSE MACGREGOR'S SYNDROME. HE'S EVEN FOUND A CURE FOR THE DISEASE IN CERTAIN STAGES. THERE SHE IS. YOU GET THE DIAMONDS. I'LL RESCUE YOUR SNOWY BRIDE. WE'LL MEET BACK AT MY PLACE. NO. IN MY WEAKENED CONDITION, I'M NO MATCH FOR THE BAT AND BIRD. OH, YOU LEAVE THOSE BOYS TO ME. GO! CAN HE SAVE HER? HER CASE IS TOO ADVANCED, BUT MAYBE SOMEDAY... MORE RESEARCH... [BOTH SNIFFING] Robin: POISON IVY. I HATE UNINVITED GUESTS. HEY, WHAT-- OH! LOOK OUT. MY LUNGS! OH! [COUGHING, CHOKING] MY LUNGS ARE FREEZING! LET'S GO. COME ON! AHH... AHH... CHILLED...TO PERFECTION! AHH...THERE. NO BEAUTY. GRRR! JUST THE BEAST. GRRR! GRRR! UNH! GRRR! GRRR! HEY THERE, PRETTY BIRDIE. GIVE YOURSELF UP. IF YOU SURRENDER... TO YOU? POLLY WANT A KISS? GRRR! GRRR! THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT AN ANATOMICALLY CORRECT RUBBER SUIT THAT PUTS FIRE IN A GIRL'S LIPS. WHY ARE ALL THE GORGEOUS ONES HOMICIDAL MANIACS? IS IT ME? ENOUGH SWEET TALK. OH, NO. FIRST, YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME WHERE FREEZE IS, AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL. I'M A LOVER, NOT A FIGHTER. THAT'S WHY EVERY POISON IVY ACTION FIGURE COMES COMPLETE WITH HIM. HA HA HA HA HA. TRY NOT TO MAKE A MESS WHEN YOU DIE. UNH! [COUGHING] MEN, LET'S HURRY! UP THERE! YES. YES. Officer: HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! OVER THERE! COME ON! OVER THERE! AAH! OH! OOF! AAH! STOP! LIVING IN THE SHADOW OF THE BIG, BAD BAT? YOU DON'T NEED HIM. YOU'RE THE STAR. I CAN SEE IT NOW. YOUR OWN BIG, BRIGHT SIGNAL IN THE SKY. LET ME GUIDE YOU. GRRR! OHH... LET ME KISS YOU. STOP! DON'T KISS HER. THE VICTIM AT THE AIRPORT-- TOXINS INTRODUCED THROUGH THE MOUTH. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHY DO YOU THINK SHE'S SO DESPERATE TO KISS US? I'M BETTING HER LIPS ARE POISONED. POISON KISS? YOU HAVE SOME REAL ISSUES WITH WOMEN, YOU KNOW THAT? YOU JUST COULDN'T STAND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO KISS ME AND NOT YOU. COULDN'T STAND THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING TO BE MINE AND NOT YOURS, COULD YOU? HA HA. EXIT, BANE. EXIT. RRRR. IVY'S RIGHT. I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP. I'M GOING SOLO. WHAT HAPPENED? HOW'D THEY GET AWAY? HUH. I'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD WITH COMPETITION. WHO NEEDS A FRIGID WIFE, ANYWAY? HUMPH! MAKE YOURSELF RIGHT AT HOME. WHERE'S MY WIFE? THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO. BATMAN DEACTIVATED HER. SHE'S DEAD. YOU LIE! OH, NO. [CRACKING] I'M SORRY. THEIR BONES WILL TURN TO ICE! THEIR BLOOD WILL FREEZE IN MY HANDS! KILL THEM, OF COURSE... BUT WHY STOP THERE? WHY SHOULD ONLY BATMAN AND ROBIN DIE WHILE THE SOCIETY THAT CREATED THEM GOES UNPUNISHED? YES. IF I MUST SUFFER, HUMANITY WILL SUFFER WITH ME! I SHALL REPAY THEM FOR SENTENCING ME TO A LIFE WITHOUT THE WARMTH OF HUMAN COMFORT! I WILL BLANKET THE CITY IN ENDLESS WINTER! FIRST... GOTHAM... AND THEN... THE WORLD! JUST WHAT I HAD IN MIND. EVERYTHING DEAD ON EARTH EXCEPT US. A CHANCE FOR... MOTHER NATURE TO START AGAIN. BEHOLD... THE DAWN OF A NEW AGE. OH... [SQUAWK] MY MUTANT PLANTS HAVE THE STRENGTH OF THE DEADLIEST ANIMALS. ONCE YOU HAVE FROZEN MANKIND, THESE BABIES WILL OVERRUN THE GLOBE, AND WE SHALL RULE THEM. RIGHT. FOR WE WILL BE... THE ONLY 2 PEOPLE LEFT IN THE WORLD. YES. ADAM... AND EVIL. YES. YOU DISTRACT THE BAT AND BIRD WHILE I PREPARE TO FREEZE... GOTHAM! AHH! [BEEPING] IT'S STAGE ONE OF MACGREGOR'S SYNDROME. I'M SORRY. ALL WE CAN DO IS MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. MACGREGOR'S SYNDROME-- THAT'S WHAT FRIES' WIFE HAD. YES. ALFRED'S CONDITION IS LESS SEVERE. FRIES' RESEARCH SAID HE CURED A CASE LIKE ALFRED'S. IT JUST DIDN'T SAY HOW. WELL, I CHECKED THE MEDICAL DATABASE. NO ONE ELSE IS EVEN CLOSE. ALL RIGHT. I'M LATE FOR THE DEDICATION, THEN I GO AFTER FREEZE AND IVY ALONE. YEAH, LIKE HELL YOU DO. DICK, DON'T. DON'T PUSH ME RIGHT NOW. OR WHAT? NO ONE CAN CAPTURE IVY BUT THE BIG, BAD BAT? YEAH, RIGHT. YOU JUST WANT HER FOR YOURSELF, DON'T YOU? YES. I WANT HER SO BADLY, I CAN TASTE IT. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. LOOK...YOU AND I ARE PERFECT TARGETS. SHE HAS DONE SOMETHING TO US. SHE HAS US FIGHTING OVER HER SOMEHOW. LOOK, HERE'S WHAT I KNOW: SHE LOVES ME AND NOT YOU, AND IT'S DRIVING YOU CRAZY. THAT'S WHY YOU STOPPED US FROM KISSING, BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T HAVE HER, NO ONE CAN. SHE'S CLOUDED YOUR MIND, AND YOU'RE NOT THINKING STRAIGHT. OH, BUT I AM... FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME. LOOKIT. I WANT A ROBIN SIGNAL IN THE SKY, ALL RIGHT? I'M TIRED OF LIVING IN YOUR SHADOW. ALL THAT ENDS RIGHT NOW. I'M SORRY, UNCLE. I WAS TOO LATE. Y-YOU MUST... YOU MUST DO SOMETHING FOR ME. FIND MY BROTHER WILFRED, YOUR UNCLE, WHEREVER HE IS, AND GIVE HIM THIS. I HAVE DUTIES THAT HE MUST FULFILL IN MY STEAD. ONLY FAMILY CAN BE TRUSTED. WHAT IS IT? IT IS A SACRED TRUST OF 2 GOOD MEN WHOM I HAVE THE HONOR OF CALLING SON. TAKE IT TO WILFRED, AND I IMPLORE YOU... NEVER OPEN IT. YOU LOOK SO LIKE YOUR MOTHER. Gossip Gerty: BONSOIR, GLAMOROUS GOTHAMITES. EVERYONE WHO'S ANYONE HAS FLOCKED TO THE GOTHAM OBSERVATORY AND TONIGHT'S STAR-STUDDED DEDICATION OF THE NEW TELESCOPE. OOH! OOH! OOH! OOH!

YOUNG MAN, PLEASE. JULIE! HELLO, GERTY. LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. COMMISSIONER GORDON. YES? I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED, WHERE DOES THAT BIG OLD BAT LIGHT COME FROM? WHY...IT'S... RIGHT ON TOP OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS. I'D JUST LOVE TO SEE IT, BUT YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS. WHY, DEAR LADY, I AM THE COMMISSIONER OF THE POLICE. I HAVE THE KEYS RIGHT HERE IN MY POCKET. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT? I'M PROUD. MM-HMM? IT LOOKS WONDERFUL. IT'S REALLY GREAT. [SNIFFS] WHO ARE YOU, DEAR LADY? ON SECOND THOUGHT, YOU'RE WAY TOO OLD FOR ME. NO, I'M NOT. PLEASE... COME BACK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? COME ON. SHOW ME HOW THE SATELLITES WORK. OK. HA HA HA HA HA! [WHOOPING] FIRST, I WILL TURN GOTHAM INTO AN ICY GRAVEYARD, THEN I WILL PULL BATMAN'S HEART FROM HIS BODY AND FEEL IT FREEZE IN MY HANDS. AHH... HA HA HA HA HA HA! REVENGE! QUICKLY, BANE. QUICKLY, NOW. YES. [BANE STRAINING] LET THERE BE LIGHT. ONLY FAMILY CAN BE TRUSTED? WELL... I'M FAMILY. HEY. I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE TRYING TO BEAT BACK DEATH. EVERYTHING I'VE DONE, EVERYTHING I'M... CAPABLE OF DOING... BUT I CAN'T SAVE YOU. THERE'S NO DEFEAT IN DEATH, MASTER BRUCE. VICTORY COMES IN DEFENDING WHAT WE KNOW IS RIGHT WHILE WE STILL LIVE. [CHUCKLES] "...TO TRY HIM BEYOND HIS YEARS, "HAS PLANTED IN HIS BREAST "AFFECTIONS AND FEELINGS WHICH WOULD DO HONOR TO MANY WHO REMEMBERED HIS DAYS 6 TIMES OVER." I LOVE YOU, OLD MAN. AND I LOVE YOU, TOO. [KISS] THIS BETTER BE ONE HELL OF A SECRET. MARGARET... MARGARET. PEG. THE COMBINED POWER OF THE TELESCOPE'S REFLECTING CRYSTALS WILL COMPLETE MY FREEZING ENGINE. YES. GRRR. NO MATTER WHAT THEY TELL YOU, MR. BANE, IT IS THE SIZE OF YOUR GUN THAT COUNTS. GUN. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? IT'S NOT A BAT LIGHT. IT'S A ROBIN SIGNAL. IVY'S CALLING ME. HER NAME IS PAMELA ISLEY. I SAW HER TALKING TO GORDON. SHE MUST'VE STOLEN HIS KEYS AND CHANGED THE SIGNAL. YEAH. SHE DID IT FOR ME, FOR LOVE. SHE'D INFECTED US WITH SOME SORT OF PHEROMONE EXTRACT. OH, IS THAT WHAT IT IS, BRUCE? I'M UNDER SOME KIND OF MAGIC SPELL? SHE WANTS TO KILL YOU, DICK. YOU WOULD SAY ANYTHING TO KEEP HER AWAY FROM ME, WOULDN'T YOU? TO KEEP HER FOR YOURSELF. YOU ONCE SAID TO ME THAT BEING PART OF A TEAM MEANS TRUSTING YOUR PARTNER, AND SOMETIMES COUNTING ON SOMEONE ELSE IS THE ONLY WAY TO WIN. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? YOU WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT BEING PARTNERS. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BEING A FAMILY. SO I'M ASKING YOU... FRIEND, PARTNER... BROTHER... WILL YOU TRUST ME NOW? [SIGHS] ALL THE CRYSTALS ARE IN PLACE. THANK YOU. [CRASH] OH! HI! OH. I'M SORRY ABOUT THE DOOR. IS THE PARTY OVER? OVER! WHO IS THIS NUTBALL? AAH! OH! AAH! HA HA HA HA HA! BOMB. BOMB. BOMB. BOMB. IF REVENGE IS A DISH BEST SERVED COLD... THEN PUT ON YOUR SUNDAY FINEST. IT'S TIME TO FEAST! TONIGHT... HELL FREEZES OVER! HAH! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! AAH! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA HA HA! [ALARM BEEPS] INTRUDER ALERT. INTRUDER ALERT. INTRUDER ALERT. INTRUDER ALERT. IDENTIFY. IDENTIFY. UNCLE ALFRED, IT'S ME... BARBARA. I EXPECTED YOU MIGHT FIND YOUR WAY DOWN HERE, CHILD. AS SUCH, I PROGRAMMED MY BRAIN ALGORITHMS INTO THE BATCOMPUTER AND CREATED A VIRTUAL SIMU-SIMULATION. I'D LIKE TO HELP BATMAN AND ROBIN. I ANTICIPATED YOU WOULD AND TOOK THE LIBERTY TO CREATE SOMETHING IN YOUR SIZE. SUIT ME UP, UNCLE ALFRED. [IVY GIGGLES] HI THERE. IS YOUR THUMB THE ONLY PART OF YOU THAT'S GREEN? YOU WILL JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT. I WANT US TO BE TOGETHER, BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF. I NEED A SIGN-- HOW ABOUT "SLIPPERY WHEN WET"? OF TRUST. TELL ME YOUR PLAN. KISS ME, AND I'LL TELL YOU. TELL ME, AND I'LL KISS YOU. FREEZE HAS TAKEN THE NEW TELESCOPE AND TURNED IT INTO A GIANT FREEZING GUN. HE'S ABOUT TO TURN GOTHAM INTO AN ICE CUBE. I'VE GOT TO STOP HIM. ONE KISS... MY LOVE... FOR LUCK. BAD LUCK, I'M AFRAID. TIME TO DIE, LITTLE ROBIN. I HATE TO DISAPPOINT YOU, BUT... RUBBER LIPS ARE IMMUNE TO YOUR CHARMS. UNH! AAH! AAH! OH! AAH! AAH! SEE YA. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SET A TRAP, VENUS. SORRY. MY VINES HAVE A CRUSH ON YOU. HA HA HA HA! GOT TO GO. SO MANY PEOPLE TO KILL, SO LITTLE TIME. [CRASH] YOU'RE ABOUT TO BECOME COMPOST. UGH! UNH! USING FEMININE WILES TO GET WHAT YOU WANT? TRADING ON YOUR LOOKS? READ A BOOK, SISTER. THAT PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE NUMBER WENT OUT LONG AGO. CHICKS LIKE YOU GIVE WOMEN A BAD NAME. [WHIP SNAPPING] UNH! [BUZZING] AS I TOLD LADY FRIES WHEN I PULLED HER PLUG... THIS IS A ONE-WOMAN SHOW. I DON'T THINK SO. HYAH! HMM. HYAH! AAH! HYAH! OH! CURSES! NO-O-O! AAH! AAH! AAAAAAH! OH! FREEZE IS GOING TO ICE THE CITY. I KNOW. AND YOU ARE? BATGIRL. THAT'S NOT AWFULLY P.C. WHAT ABOUT "BATPERSON" OR "BATWOMAN"? BRUCE, IT'S ME, BARBARA.

HA HA HA HA HA HA! YES. YES. YES. YES! Man: WE GOT TO RUN FOR IT! [SIRENS] AHH! HA HA HA HA HA! WE HAVE LESS THAN 11 MINUTES TO THAW THE CITY. GOT YOU! NOW! SHIELD. NO! AAH! UNH! I'LL FINISH OFF THE CITY. YOU KILL THE KIDS, BUT LEAVE ME THE BAT. BAT. Robin: NO SIGN OF THE SNOWMAN. MAYBE HE MELTED. NO. HE'S JUST HIBERNATING. Batman: THESE HEATERS WILL THAW THEM. I HOPE YOU GOT ABOUT 10 MILLION MORE OF THOSE LITTLE TOYS. 8 MORE MINUTES, AND A CITY FULL OF GOTHAMITES ARE ICE CUBES FOREVER. SUNLIGHT COULD REVERSE THE FREEZING PROCESS. WELL, SUNRISE ISN'T FOR 5 HOURS. HERE. BUT IT'S MORNING IN THE CONGO. IF WE COULD RELAY THE SUNLIGHT... FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATOR... IT'LL TAKE THE SATELLITES ABOUT A MINUTE TO REALIGN, BUT... DAMN. DAMN? DAMN'S NOT GOOD. THOSE TARGETING MIRRORS ARE FROZEN. THE THAWING BEAM WON'T WORK. ALL RIGHT. I'LL SET THE TELESCOPE. YOU THAW THE MIRRORS. TONIGHT'S FORECAST: A FREEZE IS COMING. NO! AAH! BYE-BYE. HA HA HA! I GOT YOU! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAAAH! NO. I GOT YOU. HA HA HA HA HA HA. YES! IT'S ONE OF THOSE DAYS! AAH!

THANKS, BATMAN! NEED A RIDE? MOST OF GOTHAM'S STILL FROZEN. IT'S MIDNIGHT. THE TELESCOPE'S GONE. THERE'S NO WAY TO THAW THE CITY. SATELLITES COULD BE POSITIONED TO THAW THE CITY DIRECTLY, BUT THAT WOULD TAKE A COMPUTER GENIUS-- I'M ON IT! NO. I'M ON IT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO THIS UPSIDE DOWN. MEN--EVERYTHING THE HARD WAY. YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD AT THIS, LITTLE GIRL. WELL...WATCH AND LEARN, LITTLE BOY. LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE A BEAUTIFUL DAY. I'M TAKING YOU BACK TO ARKHAM ASYLUM. GO ON...

Batman: BUT SHE'S NOT DEAD. AAH! WE FOUND HER, RESTORED HER. SHE'S STILL FROZEN, ALIVE... WAITING FOR YOU TO FIND A CURE. HUH? SHE LIVES? YES. SHE LIVES! BUT VENGEANCE ISN'T POWER. ANYONE CAN TAKE A LIFE. BUT TO GIVE LIFE... THAT'S TRUE POWER, A POWER YOU ONCE HAD. SHE'S ALIVE? SO I'M ASKING YOU... VICTOR FRIES... HELP ME SAVE ANOTHER LIFE. SHOW ME HOW TO CURE MACGREGOR'S SYNDROME STAGE ONE, AND MAYBE YOU CAN ALSO SAVE THE LIFE OF THE MAN YOUR WIFE ONCE LOVED. HE'S STILL INSIDE YOU, VICTOR. BURIED...DEEP... BENEATH THE SNOW. WILL YOU HELP ME... DOCTOR? TAKE 2 OF THESE... AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING. I'LL HAVE YOUR WIFE MOVED TO THE LAB AT ARKHAM. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE YOUR RESEARCH THERE. ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS WAIT...

AND I HAVE COME TO MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL. PREPARE FOR A BITTER HARVEST. WINTER... HAS COME AT LAST. AHEM. ALFRED. ARE YOU... RATHER DISAPPOINTED AT HOW POORLY I HAVE TAUGHT YOU PROPER HOUSEKEEPING. AND QUITE WELL, IT SEEMS! THANKS TO YOU, SON. THANKS TO YOU ALL. WELL DONE, BRUCE. YOU, TOO. WELL DONE. I GOT ONE QUESTION. WHEN BATGIRL AND I FELL OFF THE TELESCOPE, WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY AND SAVE US? IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE FALLEN, AND YOU WEREN'T THERE TO CATCH ME. I FIGURED YOU COULD HANDLE IT. YOU KNOW, DICK, SOMETIMES COUNTING ON SOMEBODY ELSE IS THE ONLY WAY TO WIN. Barbara: AHEM! EXCUSE ME. I BELIEVE I'M THE ONE WHO KICKED IVY'S BOTANICAL BUTT. YEAH, THAT WAS ME. I DID IT ALL BY MYSELF. THAT WAS ME. YOU ARE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. BRUCE, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO WIN THIS ARGUMENT. PARTNERS? [SIGHS] PARTNERS. PARTNERS. WE'RE GOING TO NEED A BIGGER CAVE.
