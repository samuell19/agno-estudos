I see. You're going to the 4th branch? Yeah. Just during the opening month in August. I'm helping them out during my summer vacation. Good luck. Yeah. Akihiko, don't be lazy while I'm away. Sure. Akihiko... Say something, Akihiko! Sayaka-san! Hey, hey, Sayaka-san! Look, Sayaka-san! It's Misakikaigan! Somehow, we tightly join hands and combine our wishes. It's so pretty! Somehow, we tightly join hands and combine our wishes. Somehow, we tightly join hands and combine our wishes. Reality is short-lived, it's so easy to miss. We must struggle to reach that place, because I'm sure our dream exists there. I WISH Don't cry anymore, because tomorrow won't appear... Until the day both of us have struggled and reached our dream. I'm losing my way. I want to feel you, always. So easily broken... How did we get to this place? So easily broken... It's not Tomomi's fault. So easily broken... It's lonely. Though it's painful. Iwant to become stronger. I didn't say that. It's lonely. Though it's painful. Iwant to become stronger. I'm sure... It's lonely. Though it's painful. Iwant to become stronger. It's the sea's fault! Stupid sea! This isn't over yet. This isn't over yet. I WISH Farther and farther away, I want to deliver the voice from my heart. Someday, when we are teasing each other, I will be confused. Huh, it's a human being. Someday, when we are teasing each other, I will be confused. Someday, when we are teasing each other, I will be confused. Excuse me... Someday, when we are teasing each other, I will be confused. Someday, when we are teasing each other, I will be confused. What is it? Someday, when we are teasing each other, I will be confused. I WISH Don't cry anymore, because tomorrow won't appear... Looks like we got lost. Could you show us the way to Pia Carrot? I WISH Don't cry anymore, because tomorrow won't appear... Pia Carrot? Then you should go that way. I WISH Don't cry anymore, because tomorrow won't appear... I WISH Don't cry anymore, because tomorrow won't appear... No way! We got lost that far? Until the day both of us have struggled and reached our dream. Until the day both of us have struggled and reached our dream. Thank you very much. Until the day both of us have struggled and reached our dream. Until the day both of us have struggled and reached our dream. Thank you very much. Until the day both of us have struggled and reached our dream. Until the day both of us have struggled and reached our dream. I believe in the answer. I WISH Good day! I WISH Wow, this outfit just speaks good fashion sense! The outfit from the 2nd branch is cute, but this one's pretty too! You two look great! But, why is the outfit so flashy, Akemi-san? Let's see, every year we have a summer festival here in Misakikaigan. Oh yeah, I saw the billboard! I think it's from August 10 to August 17. Tomomi-chan's outfit is also good for the festival. Akemi thought of it from the very beginning. From ordering the materials to the design... This is cute! This one's also good. I like this one too! Since she was so indecisive, they might have gotten the wrong idea and made the wrong uniforms. But, everything looks pretty. That's one of the shop manager's tasks. Get ahold of yourself, senpai! I'll cry if you bully me. But, these two outfits are both fine. Right, right! You shouldn't worry about which one is better... Good day! I brought the girls' outfits! Were you surprised by the fall outfits? They arrived early, didn't they? But we won't have a chance to wear them. I see. You're going to be here for all of August, right? Alright, this is Sayaka-chan's room. Oh my... Umm, what is it? Sorry, I got the wrong room. Takako-san! Oh, she's the dorm manager. Starting tomorrow, you'll be working together in Pia Carrot. Her name's Fuyuki Miharu-chan. Nice to meet you!! Sure. - She looked like she was angry. - I would have cried if it were me. We can apologize later. This time for sure, Sayaka-chan's room. Uh... W-well... Umm, starting tomorrow, you'll be working together with her. Her name's Kimishima Nana-chan. Nooooooooo! I'm such a coward... Yes? Hello? Sayaka-chan? Akemi-san? Eh? A party? Pia Carrot's 4th branch will open tomorrow. Takai Sayaka-san from the main office and Aizawa Tomomi-san from the 2nd branch have come to help. They will help us prepare. Since we're all girls here, let's have a house party! Yay! Well then, let's have a toast! Alrighty! The minors get the juice. To the success of Pia Carrot's 4th branch! Cheers! Cheers! Delicious! This dorm is amazing! It even has an outdoor bath. It used to be a dorm, three years ago. I worked here as a dorm manager back then. Why did you two come here? Why, you ask? The shop manager said I should come and help. My shop manager said that too. I see. You came here because you were forced to. Nana-chan is from this area. I'm sorry. It's not like I didn't want to come. It's just my first time at this lovely place. Really? Yeah, this place reminds me of the starry sky. Indeed. Yeah, let's work hard. Right! Welcome! Welcome to Pia Carrot!! Are the seats here acceptable? I'll read your order again. Two rice omelettes, one ice coffee and one ice milk tea. Is that right? Here's the order! Coming right up! The total comes to 2173 yen. Good day! I just came here to visit. Welcome! Wow, time to eat! It's delicious! And this one.. It's really good! This one too... This is great! This is bliss! Oh, Akemi-chan? Is my fruit parfait here yet? Can I ask you something? Sure. Akihiko! Let's go, Akihiko! Okay! I have a request. I-I'm sorry. Please. Opening day is now over. So, what'll we do to make it more lively? We'll see. Welcome! Welcome! Ah, Sayaka-chan. You can take a break now. Sure. Please stop! Your job comes first, doesn't it? Let's play like we used to! No! Please stop, Sirs! Shut up! Sayaka-chan! A brat like you shouldn't play hero. Take this! Stop! What the hell! That's my line! Bullying girls is the worst! You bitch! Miyuki! Found you! You're here! Oh, excuse me... These bastards have been bullying women for quite some time. They're always around causing trouble for everyone. That's why I brought my friends from the Karate Dojo. I finally got you! This is the last straw. Don't come to Misakikaigan anymore! Shit! Are you okay? Thank you very much!! This is yours, right? Thank you very much. You too, are you okay? Akemi-san, what happened? Did you get in trouble? It's over. Sorry. I came here as soon as I heard. Miharu-san! They used to be my friends. My little brother was worried that I'd get killed. He went to their meeting place. I don't want anyone to get hurt for my sake anymore. That's why, when everyone came to help... I was... Those guys are troublemakers. Even if you weren't here, they'd still cause a problem. This shop is a good shop. I know that from coming here everyday. And the people are nice too. So, don't let this incident get to you. She's right. When something bad happens, just don't pay attention to it. We're friends after all. Let's do our best from now on. Thank you. I want to work for this shop too. Miyuki-san, what's your current job? I just got laid off from my last job. I'm unemployed. Then, I'm sure you'll be accepted here. I have to go back to the main of ice at the end of August. At the end of August? That's too bad. Umm... If you have any problem at all, don't hesitate to talk to me. You look like the type who keeps her feelings to herself. Welcome! Welcome to Pia Carrot! Sayaka-san! Miharu-san! Good day! These are Tomomi's friends, Kamizuka Yuki-chan and Shima Noriko-chan. They'll be staying in Tomomi's room for a while. I hope it's okay with you. - Nice to meet you! - Nice to meet you! What? We're getting fewer customers? Yes, because the Misakikaigan festival has started. But... The number of visitors to the beach is increasing. The problem is... Ah, street shops! They're more attractive to the customers. I see. I can't think of a way to get the customers back here. I got it! What is it, Noboru-kun? I have an idea! Sorry for the long wait. The 32nd Miss Misakikaigan Contest will now commence! What should I do? I'm so nervous. Natsuki-chan, how can you be so calm? This is an emergency, so we have no choice. Tomomi, don't tell me you're participating. You traitor! It was her boss' order, so there was ho choice. Right, right! Besides, Tomomi is not the only one in this. Ta-dah! I put your name in too, Yuki-chan! Whaaaat? T-Tomomi-chan... You have a beautiful body tan. That's because I always swim during my free time. Good luck, Miharu-san, Nana-chan. Yeah! Yeah! Why can't I participate in this? This is a contest for young ladies... But I'm still in my twenties, and single too! I, Kamizuka Yuki, will perform magic! One, two, three! What? What? What's wrong..? All right, next up is... wow, a team of six girls! Takai Sayaka-san! Aizawa Tomomi-san! Fuyuki Miharu-san! Kimishima Nana-san! Iwakura Natsuki-san! Hasegawa Akemi-san! We're employees at Pia Carrot here in Misakikaigan. - Everyone, please visit our shop! - We will sing for our performance. "Waitress of the Beach" One, two... One, two, three, go! Ah, the waves of summer sunlight shine down on me. Your skin shines radiantly. Ah, from the shops white terrace... I want you to notice the warm glance I'm sending you. My body warmly blushed for my sweetheart. I wonder, would you like the parfait that holds our secrets? And add an ice cream! I want to see your pretty smile forever. I want you to turn your eyes towards only me. The moment I wear that uniform is also the moment our feelings are one. I want to tell you my feelings right away. Well then, it's time for our judges to announce the winner! The winner of the 32nd Miss Misakikaigan Contest is... Number 7, the Pia Carrot team! No way! We did it! It's unbelievable! Wh-what? Good job, everyone! Step forward, please! Now then, a speech from the winners please. Ready? Please visit us at Pia Carrot! Tomomi-chan! Coming! I'll be right with you! Miharu-san, over here! Yes, thank you for waiting. Akemi-san! Ah, welcome. Welcome! Miyuki-san! The swimsuit contest worked like a charm, eh? You saw us? Have you ever thought of modeling? I think that's only for this year, probably... Then that's fine. Stop it! Sayaka-san! Sayaka-san! There have been fewer and fewer people ever since the festival ended. Sayaka-san, you'll be going away soon too, right? Yeah, the day after tomorrow is my last day. Ah, there's a fireworks show too. Promise me you'll see it, okay? They're really beautiful. Nana-chan! What are you doing here slacking? Oh, hi! Ehh, this is bad! My shift is starting soon! I'm going first, please excuse me. See you at the shop later. Nana-chan, hurry up! Alright! Why do I have to cheer for the basketball team? It's for our school spirit! I don't even know the rules. Don't fret. Nice shot, Yuichi-kun! Yuichi! Are they losing? Ten more seconds! They can win with one more goal! Over here! Shoot, Akihiko! That was a bummer, Yuichi-kun. And that was your final junior high game too. It's only a game. Don't take it so hard. Go in! Go in! Go in! Go in! Go in! Practicing basketball in the rain, you said? That's a sure way to catch a cold. I'm sorry. It was stupid of me. Is that really all? If you have any problems, it's best to let them out. I've had the same experience. Takako-san, you have? I was almost married before. Long ago, the person who was going to marry me ran away. It was on my wedding day. For a while, in order to forget him... I worked endlessly... until I collapsed. Do what you think is best for you. Think about it carefully. I also did the same thing. Takako-san. Drink your medicine, okay? I'll leave it here. Sure. Takako-san, thank you very much. That outfit suits you. Miyuki-san, you're working here too? Actually, I will start in September. Sayaka-chan caught a cold, so I'm filling in for her. Miyuki-san is very strong. She can beat weird guys in one hit! Oh, stop it, Tomomi-chan. I wonder if the fireworks tomorrow will be okay. Don't worry. This typhoon will go away before the night ends. Yeah! Good day!! Welcome! Welcome!! Wow, that was some rain! I'm soaking all over. Akihiko... Why? That time... why didn't you stop me from coming here to help? Hello? Hello? Sayaka-chan? Akemi-san? Is Tomomi-chan there? No. Did something happen? That girl just dashed out of the shop, and she hasn't come back. What?! Tomomi-san! If you hear me, please answer! Tomomi-san! No, I haven't seen her. I see. If you find her, please call this number. Sure. Sorry, please cancel for tonight. I'll make it up to you somehow. Tomomi-chan! Sayaka-san!! Tomomi never gave up on Maeda-san after all. Maeda-san? He works with Tomomi in the 2nd branch. Tomomi-chan liked him. But, Maeda-san already has a girlfriend. Her name's Hinomori Azusa-san. I thought Tomomi had already given up on him when she accepted the offer to help the 4th branch. Earlier, when Maeda-sah and Azusa-san entered the shop, they were together. - Tomomi! - Tomomi-chan! She just dashed out. If she likes him, why did she run away from the 2nd branch? That idiot! Tomomi-chan! Where are you? Tomomi-chan! Typhoon no. 18 has finally reached the Kanto area. The typhoon will only last for a short period of time. Stupid sea! What if she... Please wait by the phone. Sayaka-san! Tomomi-chan! It's dangerous here. Let's go back, everyone's worried. I heard from Yuki-chan about Maeda-san. I understand your feelings, Tomomi-chan. But, you can't be like this. You can't make everyone worry. Sayaka-san, you don't understand anything! My feelings are being rejected. I understand you. I experienced the same thing. The reason I came here to the 4th branch was to run away from the person I love. The first time I saw him was in my third year of junior high school. He was a basketball player. We went to the same high school too, but I never had the courage to start a conversation. Even when we were introduced to each other at Pia Carrot, I could barely shake his hand. But, once again, I couldn't express my feelings. So, when I left to come here to the 4th branch... All I wanted him to say was, "I want you to work here with me." But... "Good luck in the 4th branch." Maeda-san said that to Tomomi too. Tomomi doesn't know what to do. Even though I like Maeda-san this much, he still doesn't know my feelings. How can I face him now? Akihiko... No! I can't give up now. I... still haven't told you... my feelings... I love you. Now I can't say it...! You okay? Miyuki-san... Where's Tomomi-chan? Sayaka-san... I'm sorry. Tomomi-chan! I'm glad you two are safe. Miyuki-san... Thank you. Me too, thank you. It's OK. It was all so simple... Huh? how to express my feelings. I realized that too... when I was drowning. Seems the rain has stopped. You're right. This is bliss. Hey! What were you thinking, making people worry like that? Yuki-chan... I'm glad you're safe. We were really worried. But the next time you want to run away, let us know first. Eh? Alright. Sorry for the wait. I have the sake. But, it's only for 20-year-olds and above. Have you recovered from your cold? Yeah. Looks like the typhoon blew it away. You're all good friends. Yes, very good friends! Come, let's go. Oh, this is Sayaka-chan and Tomomi-chan's last night, right? Let's just have fun! Right!! Tomomi, let's go. Let's go. OK! Sayaka-san... Huh? Tomomi will confess now. Tomomi-chan... With Azusa-san here, I think he'll decline. But, I don't want to keep on wondering. I will confess right now too. Sayaka-san... Let's do our best! Yeah! I've kept Akihiko's phone number forever. Today is my first time using it. After all the courage I've gathered... - Why is the line busy, stupid Akihiko! - Why is the line busy, stupid Sayaka! I thought it might be nice to watch the fireworks with you, Sayaka. Oh, the fireworks have started! Let's go. Yeah... The sound of footsteps erases the silence. On the cold asphalt... We touched each other back then, exiting the dead-end alley. Those times seem so far away. I feel impatient. I'm holding you tight. Where shall we go? I wish for our time to be engraved in eternity. I WISH YOU ARE HERE Don't be confused. I want to see the other side of the same sky. I WISH YOU ARE HERE I WISH YOU ARE HERE I want to tell you, close to you. The locked-up past and the wide-open future... Everything will begin anew. I want to cuddle, hug, and keep you warm. I won't start running because I don't know. I WISH YOU ARE HERE Don't be confused. I want to see the other side of the same sky. I WISH YOU ARE HERE I WISH YOU ARE HERE I want to tell you, close to you. Akihiko... I love you.
