Cut it. - All right. Hold it. [Whiny notes] What is that idiot doing? [Grating notes] - What's that idiot doing? - I just asked that. - What's the answer? - I don't know. You're the director. You brought him over from India. You'd better start telling him what to do or we'll be out of business. Now go ahead. Come on. - Charlie - Yes... Ready? Action! Cut, damn it. Cut. - Mr Bakshi - Yes, sir... Has it occurred to you that the period of our picture is 1878? Oh yes indeed, sir. I am well aware that that is the period of the film: 1878. Mr Bakshi, are you also aware that in 1878 they weren't wearing underwater watches? Yes, sir. I know that. They had not even been invented. - Got the time? - Yes, it's... - Oh my God! - All right. Lunch, everybody. [Man through loudspeaker] That's 42 for the crew, 1 hour for the cast. OK, guys. The cue for the demolition is when I lower my hand like this. - We've got one shot at this. Let's get it right. - All right. Places, everybody. Marty, Clutterbuck says, if we don't wrap this location today, it's your neck! - All we have left is to blow up the fort. - OK. Great. OK, Ken. Let's go. - All right. Carol... Earl... - All right. Stand by. You! Yes, you! You get off of my set and get out of my picture. Off. Out. You're through. You're washed up. You're finished. I'll see to it, you never make another movie again. - Does that include television, sir? - I'll kill him. [Intercom buzzes] - Yes... - Mr Divot calling from location, on 6. All right. Yes, Charlie... What? What? The whole damn thing? How the hell could a thing like that happen? What's his name? Spell it. "Hrundi... V..." "B-A-K-S-H-I." I'll see to it he never works again in this town. - Your wife wants the party guest list. - It's on the desk. You know where to reach me. I need an address for Hrundi V. Bakshi. "B-A-K-S-H-I."

[♪ Band plays jazz] [speaks Italian] The mother says to the father, "We've got the wrong baby" and the father says, "Sh! It's a better buggy." I'd never heard that. It's marvellous. [Laughter continues] [forced laugh] Yes. I missed the middle part, but I can tell from the way that you are enjoying it it must have been a very humorous anecdote because the way you are laughing just shows how much you enjoyed it. I love a good laugh, don't you? It makes the world go round. It's good to have a laugh, wonderful! Very good! I must remember that one. [Parrot squawks] "...bound and gagged for six hours." They took everything... even the gold watch my daddy left me. [Forces laugh] They took the gold watch that your father left you? [Laughs] I'm sorry. It's absolutely fantastic! What a wonderful thing to do! Take everything including your father's watch. I tell you, tonight is one big round of laughter... all fun and laughter! The congressman was just telling us about the time he was robbed. [Chortles] - Who's the foreigner? - I don't know. Someone my mixed-up wife invited. [Hrundi chortles] Hello, dog. What do you want, eh? You like my feet, do you? Have your fill and away you go. Feet are considered a delicacy among certain animals, you know. Go on. You've had enough now. Off! Ciao. Chow-chow. In fact, there are man-eating animals who will eat only the feet, not one other thing. Get away. Ciao now. Ciao, dog. Get away. Get away from me, dog. - Vodka or scotch, sir? - No, I... no, thank you. - Good evening, Mr Divot. How are you? - How are you? Smile at them. Good evening, general. I'd like you to meet Miss Michele Monet. "Mr Clutterbuck"... "Mrs Clutterbuck"... How are you, Alice? [Forces laugh] I'll introduce my guests, if I may: "Mrs. Dunphy"... I've heard some wonderful things about you. Well sir, you seem to have a wonderful party going. - How do you like it so far? - Fine. Have a drink. Go ahead. - Hello. - Oh hello. - Hello. Good evening. - Good evening. What a beautiful evening it is, to be sure! What's in there? What, in here? Well there is nothing in there. Yes there is. Oh I don't know. I don't think so. - No. - Can't you see it? No. There is definitely nothing in there. If there was something it's gone away now anyway. Well, I can see it. What is it? I don't know but I don't like it. Hare Ram Ram. Hey. - Oh. Pardon me, sir. - That's quite all right, fellow. - I'm so sorry, sir. I beg your pardon. - Honey, we'll play it over here. Right here... This is an easy shot. First get in the saddle just like I taught you. That's it. - No. I feel silly. - Oh no, hon. You can do it this way. I was doing it the other day. Just relax and you can... Just relax. Just... Pay no attention to me, sir. I'm merely spectating. Fine. I can see that you are an experienced player. One of the best, fellow, one of the best! Sir, what is the name of a game that has a multitude of colored balls like that? - "Pool." - "Poo"? - No, not "poo"... "pool." - "Pool". Oh like "swimming pool". - I've never heard of a game called "pool". - A fine game! And what is the object of it? To disperse these balls strategically around the table? To get the balls in the holes, except the white one. That is the art? The art is not to have the white one in? - Right. - Good! And how many people can play? - Oh whole bunches, or twos and threes. - Groups of people can play? - Or by yourself. - Thank goodness! How wonderful! [Speaks Italian] Keep your eye on the white ball, and you can... Oh Oh excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir, but you are, are you not, "Wyoming Bill" Kelso, the famous film star? - That's me, in the flesh. - Oh God! What a moment in my life! I've seen every one of your films. Oh that's wonderful, wonderful! [Cries out] - What a wonderful strong grip you've got! - Yes. I do. I would have been disappointed if you hadn't crushed my hand. Would you do me the honor to sign me an autograph? Oh sure. Here... Hold this. I'll be glad to. - I'm also in the acting profession. - You are? Yes, indeed. I'm not in your quality, but I am also an actor. - What's your name? - "Hrundi": "H-R-U-N-D-I." Wait till I tell them at home that I've met him! - Where are you from? - I am from India. - Got you covered, Indian! - Oh - Bang! Howdy, partner. - You're pretty quick on the draw there! Never I believed in my whole life, I would meet him and he would go "Bang, partner!" Listen to me. "White man speak with forked tongue!" You old horned toad, buddy! - Cute little fellow, isn't he? - I know all your sayings, all of them! The one where you walk along and go... - Hrundi, say hello to the signorina here. - Hello, partener. - Piacere - "Bakshi" - There you go... - Ah thank you. - This is a wonderful thing for me. - My pleasure. Thank you, and I would love to say that it has been the greatest moment in my life! Bang! I got you! - I was quick on the draw. - You beat me that time, pal. That's right. - Lots of luck to you. - Yes and the same to you, sir. [♪ Jazzy dance music] Howdy, partener. [Mouthing] [music ends] Oh that was a short dance. - That's right. - They don't go on for long, do they? We'd just started and... Well anyway, thank you very much. Perhaps we can dance again later. - Oh, OK. - If your carnet de bal is not full up. [Chortles] [overlapping conversations] Hello, Polly. Hello, Polly. Pretty Polly! [Parrot] Hello.

I wonder if you could... - Can you hold here? - Yes. Would you just let my hand go? You've got my hand. Thank you. Now I'll take this from you. Hold on one moment. [Glass smashes] Excuse the mess up here. It is "Birdie Num Nums". I've got them under my feet. [Glass smashes] Just one second. If you can take this around you... Just lift the ashtray, please. Yes.

But first let's have a little tiddly at the bar. - Hello. - Oh howdy, little buddy. [Cries out] That's my old cowboy crusher: an Indian grip. Oh you really crushed my old Indian hand. It, sort of, smarts, doesn't it? The friendliest little creature I ever met! It's an honor to have had my hand crushed by Wyoming Bill Kelso. Wait till I tell them back home! Ooh Pooh - Oh - OK - Pardon me. - It's OK. - Hello. - Hello. Oh... it was occupied. - Oh - Yes. "Hrundi V. Bakshi" - Pardon? - That is what my name is called. - Oh. "Michele Monet". - How do you do? How do you do? Are you having a good time? - Mm-hm. - Good! - Are you having a good time? - Oh yes. I am having a good time. - Good! - It's good to be having a good time. - Yes. - Yes. - Are you an actress? - Yes. - Oh yes. I can tell. - Oh? - Because I am an actor. - Oh I see. Actors can tell when actresses are actresses, and actresses can tell... - It is a thing that we have together. - Ah - You are also French. - How do you know? Your name and the way you speak English. - Oh that's right. Do you speak French? - Just enough to get myself into trouble. I'll tell you what I can say: Où est la direction de la tour Eiffel, s'il vous plaît? That's pretty good. You do speak French. - Do you speak Hindustani? - No. Well you are not missing anything. Oh dear! I am here at the moment taking part in Mr. General Clutterbuck's latest motion-picture extravaganza. - Oh. That's wonderful! - It is a main feature role and I am very glad to have the opportunity to do it. - Congratulations! - Thank you. Are you doing something in a movie? - Are you working in a movie? - No but next week I'm doing a test for Mr Divot. Oh, Mr Divot! [Chortles] - What? - Oh listen. I... - Oh - Let's get to the bar. - Mr Divot, how do you do? - Yes. Right, fellow. All right? - Goodbye. - 'Bye. [Chortles] - Who is that guy? - A very nice man - with an unpronounceable name. - I know him from some place. How are you, general? Remember Miss Michele Monet here? Have you heard her sing? We're giving her a test. She sings like a nightingale. - I'll look forward to that. - Excuse us, sir. We're going to the bar. - Dinner is served. - Good! Dinner is served. [Speaks Italian] Dinner is served, darling. [Parrot squawks] - Alice, where is Miss Monet sitting? - Right around here, dear. Bernie, give Miss Monet a hand, please. Excuse me for a minute, sweetheart. Dear... I believe, you're down here, dear... right down here. - "Bakshi", right? - Oh, yes. Mr. Bakshi. - Oh there's no chair. - Everybody needs to move over. Oh. Darling, would you mind moving up just one? I'm terribly sorry. I'm sorry, darling. You're going to have to move back. It was a mistake. I'm awfully sorry. Levinson, will you get the gentleman a chair, please? No. It was a mistake, but he's going to bring you a chair and you'll be all right. What happened to your little face? Nothing, except that it is somewhat nearer to the table now. My chair is lower than your chair. - Do you like your strawberry soup? - Oh strawberry soup! I haven't had it lately. - It's lovely in summer, don't you think? - Yes. Oh yes, it's... oh it's lovely right now. Good! I'm so glad. Hey. Give me some of that, will you, pal? How's the chow? It looks pretty good. No wine, thank you. No wine, please. No. Please, no wine. I know you would like me to have it, but I don't want it. All right. I don't drink. I don't smoke... no wine. Are you all right? Oh I'm so sorry. [Hrundi] I dropped my roll. If I can sit here, I won't be in anybody's way. - You're sure, you're comfortable? - Here the door won't bang me. All right. Excuse me. They should be finished with the soup. Get the plates. [Gags] - Mrs Clutterbuck, shall I serve the salad? - Yes. What are you doing? [Crash] Get into the kitchen. That is just outside Bombay. - And Bombay is in India... - Oh that is very much in India and that is indeed the gateway to India! [Crash from kitchen] I think that one of these bearers does not like the other one. You have a very hard time finding good help these days. Yes. You certainly do! [Gagging] Did you hear about the trapeze artist who got divorced? Caught his wife in the act! That's terribly funny! Yes. It's been terribly funny for about 20 years. [Whispers] Oh [scream] [parrot squawks] [parrot squeals] - Gore, are you sure, it's all right? - It's not "all right". It's divine! [Women laughing] You've got to start with education. That's where you need to spend... Mrs Clutterbuck, please can I take this opportunity to apologize to you formally for what happened at the table? Oh my dear, just forget it. It wasn't your fault. - What embarrassment for you! - Why, no. It was that ridiculous little chair they put you on! It was awful, but at the same time I feel it is my duty to say this to you now. - I just think we should forget all about it. - Indeed, you are right but before then I will also go to your husband and say to him that I am sorry. - That's not necessary, really. - It is on my conscience. - Well if you want to, go ahead. - Thank you. - General, an excellent aroma! - I'm glad you like it. I still have a few left over from the pre-Castro days. General Clutterbuck, sir please, I would like to formally apologize to you for any inconvenience that I may have caused you or your guests at the table tonight. - It's understandable. - It will never happen again should you wish to have me on your list of guests on some other occasion. When I saw what havoc that I wrought, my poor old knees turned to water! - God, what a state I was! - I can imagine. But now that I have apologized to you... also I have spoken to your good lady and I told her, sir, that it is a terrible thing to have happened and I am sorry deep down inside of me. - Enjoy yourself. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you for listening to me. - It's all right. General, about this wack... I asked her to go out with me one night... [slurred] Brandy or crème de cacao, sir? Yes. Clutterbuck's a big man. He could make a star out of me. Put the drink down and listen to me. [Whispers] [feet sloshing] - Oh I beg your pardon. - That's all right. - It is occupied. - Oh Do you speak Hindustani? No. Oh excuse me, please. [Speaks Chinese] [Chinese] Hey. Close the door, man. - Look. I told the general, you'd sing. - Well I'd rather not do it tonight. Why not? - The orchestra is gone. - There's a guitar. Do you play the guitar? - Yes. - Then you play the guitar and you sing. Hey, waiter. Come over here. You're going to be a smash. Don't worry about a thing. See that guitar? Go and get it.

I'll get something of Fred's. - [Hrundi babbles drunkenly] Here, darling... Put this on him. - Now you get out of those wet clothes. - I love the wet clothes. Thank you for a marvellous party. Whoa! Fred, darling, I had to loan him your terry. He's soaking wet. This is hers, not his. Oh darling, do hurry because the Russians will be here any minute. - The Russians? - The dancers, darling, the ballet. - [Kelso] Come on, sidekick. - No. Kelso, would you mind - What are you doing? - I am not doing anything. - You're wetting the bed. - I am not wetting the bed. My clothes are wetting the bed. - This is the big chief here. - Oh. "Big chief speak with forked tongue!" Partener... he's a TV partener. - I'll hold him. You get his pants down. - All right. - Come here, lovely man. I love you. - I've got something dry over here. [Hrundi babbles and giggles] Here, Wild Bill. You take off your coat... No. Oh no, Wild Bill. No. - Get up off the floor. - I've got him. A slippery little creature, isn't he? - Oh you naughty man! - Here... Put this on. - Put these on. - Why? Can you handle him? I have to go downstairs. Take care of it. - I'll handle it. - Wild Bill, why do you want... - Little sidekick, put these dry clothes on. - All right. I will put them on. Good idea! I've got to get downstairs before Conchita cools off. You come down with wet clothes on, and I'll stomp you and the horse you ride in on. - Got that? - Buddy... partner buddy...

You know that I don't think you are being entirely honest with me? No. Ah We have a saying in India. - Yes? - Yes. - Well... - Well what? You were saying something about a saying... Oh yes. What is it? "Wisdom is the province of the aged" "but the heart of a child is pure." That's very pretty. I'm not sure I know what it means. Neither do I. [Both giggle] What does it have to do with me? Well it has everything to do with you. - For one thing it stops you crying. - It's true. I feel better. Thank you very much. - Don't thank me. Thank my saying. - Thank you, saying. - Do you want to hear another saying? - Yes. This is a good one because it will help you to remember how many days there are in each month. It goes like this: "30 days have September, October, June and February." "All the rest got 29 except my brother, who got 6 months." Aha! Just what I thought! I've been looking all over for you. - Get your clothes. We're going to leave. - I don't think so. Look. You came with me. You're going to leave with me. Now get your clothes. - No. - Don't say "no" to me. Now get your stuff. - Go on. - Mr Divot, please... - Just stay out of this, buddy. - If she wishes to remain, that is her right. - Just who do you think you are? - In India, we know who we are. - You're Meshuga! - I am not your sugar. Baby, you decide. Do you want to come with me or stay with this guy? - I want to stay. - You're going to stay with him? OK. Nobody ever does this to me. Do you hear that? And forget about that test! You're finished in this business before you even start. [Slams door] Well that was a short career, wasn't it! Oh don't worry about that. I'd better find something to put on and call a cab. No. Don't call a cab. Stay at the party and after, I'll take you home in my three-wheeler Morgan. - No. That would be nice, but I can't stay. - Why not? Well I got myself into a funny situation. - What, with old Divot? - Yes. Is that why you were crying? - Yes. It's not really his fault. - He's a terrible man. Please stay. Let's have a wonderful time. I'd love to, really but I have nothing to wear. That's no problem. They have millions of clothes here. Anyway I've got an idea. - Who goes there? - Shh! Mr Bakshi and a damsel in distress. - What do you want? - Well you look like a man of the world. This poor lady is urgently in need of some dry clothing and I perceive that you are both about the same size.

You should have seen it! - Alice, baby, do you feel better? - Oh I'm fine. - I'm going to be in the aquacade. - That's nice. Don't drop her. Congressman and Mrs Dunphy, I don't know how to tell you It's quite all right. Call me if there's anything I can do. Mr Clutterbuck may I apologize to you for the discomfort - It's all right. - [Whispers] General, it's him! - Who? - Bakshi! He's the idiot who blew up the location! [Roars] You've got the wrong guy. Hey, little buddy. Hold on. Here's one of my old Stetsons. It just fits. And here's an autographed picture of me and my horse Fang. ♪ Nothing to lose ♪ If we are wise. ♪ We're not expecting rainbow-colored skies ♪ Not right away. ♪ Nothing to lose. ♪ It might be fun. ♪ No talk of spending lifetimes in the sun. Well, this is where I live. It's a beautiful home. I would ask you to come up but it's a little late or early... I don't know. Anyway I have to get back to feed Apu. - Apu? - Yes: my monkey. Oh It's a lovely name... for a monkey anyway. - He's used to it by now anyway. - Good! I would like to say that I enjoyed myself very much last night. I did too, very much. Especially I thought your song was very beautiful. - You did? - Yes. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Oh. Here's your hat. Oh look... You keep it. But you may need it. No. I'd like you to keep it. All right. If you should want it or need it sometimes... Well... if I need it, I could always come perhaps and pick it up. That would be very nice. When would you be available for me to pick up my hat? Well [giggles] maybe next week. - I'll come and get it then. - OK. - I would love to have my hat back. - [Giggles] Goodbye.
