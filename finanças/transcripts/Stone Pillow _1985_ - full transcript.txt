Well, I'm still here. Hey, Flora. Is it cold enough for you? I can take it. And also when I ask you to do something, please do it, all right? What is it this time? I turn my back on that supply cabinet for one second. I look back around, 200 cakes of soap are gone... And all my keys and the padlock. Women who come through this shelter, Carrie, live on the street. Do you know what just one cake of soap means to them? I know. I want to help. I just mess up everything I do. Just keep coming in. Look, get the door. What did he say? He said to get my head out of the clouds, to go out and see what life is really like out there, or get fired. Tim's always cranky on the night shift. But is that such a bad idea? What do I... What do I do? Set up a booth on the street? Hi. I see you're a homeless person. Tell me about it. You might learn something. Take off the nice clothes and the little pump shoes and just walk out there. Real simple. Just talk to people. You'll see, they'll answer yo. Morning, mama. Well, top of the morning to you, Daggat. I got you one of yesterday's sandwiches. I hope you enjoy it. Oh, gee, thanks. It's hard as nails. What are you trying to do? Break what teeth I got left? Best I could do. Old lady got herself killed yesterday just down the block. Drugged up kids tormenting her by the look of it. I can handle kids. No you can't, mama. They're mean. They think they own the world. So let them be mean. This is my corner. It's going to be cold tonight. It's cold every night. Don't you have some place inside to go? This is my place. Nothing ever happens to me here. Maybe. Bonjourno, Giuseppe. Bonjourno, Tony. Bonjourno, Flora. Gee, I'm glad to see you. Looks like you've got a lot to do. Need a hand? Yeah, sure, Flora. OK. Hey, you know I sure like to see you guys come around. I just love fruits and vegetables. You know, I used to have a garden and I used to grow... You, Flora, told us that story before. Oh. Yeah. Hey, Tony. This one don't look so good. You wouldn't want Al to have something that looks like that, would you? You're right, Flora. You want it? Thanks. Oh boy. Those are beautiful carrots. You like carrots, huh? Yeah. Hey, you dropped one. Oh, that sure is a beauty. - You want that? - Thanks. Oh, lemons, lemons... you know them's a sunshine fruit? Yeah. Oh thanks. Oh, thanks. Rub it all over you. Makes you smell good. Flora, I got a surprise for you. A surprise? What do you like better than anything else? Mama mia. Careful. It's not cooked or anything. Well, for me it don't gotta be. Grazi, grazi. Prego. Here's to you. New York City water... best damn water in the country. Wouldn't you think? Where'd it go? What'd you do with that? Hey. Hey, crazy lady. What you got in there? Must be something good, huh? Silverware and junk. Bet she stole it. Now stay away from my stuff. We could put you away, grandma. Hey, get outta here you bums. We're gonna get you lady. Bag lady, why don't you pick another corner? Because this is my corner, that's why. This ain't no bedroom. I can sleep on any street I want. This is a free country. You're for the birds. You crook. Give me back my bun. Where's my bun? Gone, right? You fed it to the damn pigeons. Oh. I fed it the pigeons a half eaten pastry I found in the garbage. That was my bun. I'm sorry. I'll pay for it. I don't want your money. I can buy my own bun... If they let me in. I'm sorry. You're sorry, you dodo. You fed it to the birds. Watch out. I thought I told you to get lost. No way, grandma. Get out of here. Oh boy. Nobody's safe around here, especially in a place like this. You know if Sonny were here he'd kill them? Get out of there. No. No. Stop it. Come back. Help. Somebody help. You miserable, no good, nincompoop. - Are you all right? - Yes. I'm all right. Damn little cockroaches can't hurt me. You? Everything I had in the world was in that bag... my money, my papers, sentimental things that I've had a long time. Yeah, well, kiss it goodbye. Kiss it goodbye. Here. Here. Take it. It's clean. I washed it myself. Bet you're a run away, huh? What? You're running away from home. You probably got your mother some place worrying about you huh? You in trouble? No. But I will be if I don't... You wouldn't last a night on the street. Men would be after you... You with your long hair your you're pretty face. Oh, what the hell. It's not my lookout. Wait. Wait. Where are you going? I got things to do. But you just said that I would freeze to death and that men would do things. Yeah, well you should have thought of that before you left home. You must know a lot about the streets. Yeah. Yeah, I do. Could you show me a few things like where to sleep and how to find food? Well now why should I? You just stole my breakfast. But I didn't know. I'm sorry. Yeah. You're sorry. You're sorry. Look, go to the shelter. They'll give you a bed for the night and they'll give you a quarter to call your mother in the morning. Kids, kids. Are you following me? Where is the shelter? Will you take me there? Why should I? Because I need help. You just said so yourself. Yeah, well you should have thought of that before you ran away. Somebody leaves home, leaves somebody crying. Sonny, Sonny. Sonny. Who's Sonny? What? Who's Sonny? None of your damn business. What's your name? Flora's my name. Florabelle. Hey, let me tell you something. You're just too dumb to be on the streets. Sonny, Sonny, Sonny. Ah. You need some change, grandma? I'd rather have a cup of coffee. Sure. Oh no. I can't. They won't let me in. Maybe you could get it for me right up there? Oh, I wouldn't mind two coffees if it wouldn't be too much trouble. You got it. I have to go bathroom. Hey, you. Get her. Get her. Get her. Stop her. Hey. Hey where are going? This is my friend's cart. Ah. I followed. I had to. I couldn't let you go. This here's my restaurant. I'll get us a bite. Yeah. Yeah, look at that. Smells good. Looks good too. Take a sniff. No, thank you. What did you say your name was? Carrie. Carrie. Cash and carry. No cash and carry huh? Now look. The first thing we gotta learn you is where it's OK to eat, because some cans got garbage and bad stuff. But this guy here runs a good clean restaurant. You go first. Take your pick. Come on. People pay good money for this stuff. We're just lucky that it hasn't gone home in some dumb doggy bag. Oh. Half a good roast beef sandwich with horseradish. Oh boy. Aw, beautiful vegetables. You know, they got vitamins and minerals. This guy really knows how to buy. Look at this... a great piece of melon. Here take it. It's good for you. Take it. Ah, and parsley. Here. Now, come on. You need some beef on your bones. No, I'll eat later. Oh. Well, in that case, you're going to have to take it with you. I think the shelter is the place for you. But let me tell you something. You better eat this stuff before you get there. Because once you get in the shelter, they take all your things away. And their food ain't so good. Tastes like slop gut. Here. Me, I like vegetables... Raw vegetables. Wait. Wait. Won't you come with me? You think I'm crazy? Gonna let them take away my stuff, put me in a room of screaming Mimi's and wash me down with nit wash that smells like kerosene? No sirree. I'd rather freeze in the street. Me too. I'll stay with you. No way. I travel alone, kiddo. Now, go on up there and ask for help. I can't. They know me. I thought you said you was new to the city. And if you've been on the streets, how come you're so damn clean? I lived with a friend. Oh. And he threw you out, huh? Oh, well... happens that way sometimes. They take you in. They give it a try. Then they get sick of you and they kick you the hell out. Hey, where's Flora? What do I care? Maybe I got lucky and she moved to another corner. The subway grate's on your corner. It's nice and warm over there. You know old she must be? Sometimes I think she's not going to last another winter. So? Maybe she's dead. You're dead you selfish cheapskate. Oh sure. You're such a good guy. You let her live in your house, eat from your plates, right? In a pig's eye you would. She could go many places if she'd just take a bath, get the nits out of her hair. And I'll tell you, her time's running out. You gotta drink lots of water. Ah. Here. Well, now if you're going to be persnickety, here. Plain old vinegar. Toughens up your feet so they take you where you want to go. Toughens up your innards too. Oh. You got to learn to eat lots of raw vegetables. They're healthy and they're good for you. Here. You eat this here carrot... Good for your teeth, good for your eyes. Oh and here's something. Iodine? Yeah, for iron. Two drops a day keeps the doctor away. You don't know what you're missing. You know, you two shouldn't stay here. Trucks pull in to load up. Fall asleep around here and they'll squash you like bugs. Besides a girl got raped here one night. Nobody heard her because nobody was around. See how he looked at you? All men see women on the streets as tramps. You gotta know how to protect yourself. First of all, you gotta make them think you're crazy. And you gotta kick them anywhere, everywhere. Then you got to bite them, scratch their eyes out. Remember, you're fighting for your life. Let them all think you're crazy. Then everybody will leave you alone, right? You see kid, you're in a jungle. It's like a bad dream but you don't wake up. Do they think you're crazy, Flora? - What? - Do they think you're crazy? I hope so. But I'm not crazy. I'm smart. I'm still here and I know how to protect myself. Come on. We got to go. And you got to wrap up better. Here, put this on and hide that beautiful hair of yours. Come on. Put your hair all up underneath there. Atta girl. My feet hurt. Oh, it's so warm in here. Move it. This here terminal's not a bad place to stay. And I'll show you around and get you settled but then I gotta get back. You know, feet get wet. And you get big sores that don't heal up. It's very important that you take care of your feet. You've got to be real careful. How did you learn so much? I've been on the streets a long time. You had a home once though? Everybody had a home once. What was it like? Oh, it was a farm... Just a little place. But it was real nice. It had wicker furniture and curtains and we grew vegetables... good ones, not like that city junk you get around here. How did you lose it? You don't want to hear all that sad stuff. Yes, I do. Come on. Let's get out of here. Somebody's crying. It's dangerous. The cops don't come here but other people do. Wait. That's a baby. It might be abandoned. That's not our lookout. Come on back. We got no protection. People will kill for a quarter if they're hungry enough. Hello. Can we help you? Foreigners. What do they want? Food probably. All right. OK. All right. All right. Come on. Who's on? It's OK. It's Grace. Now you go straight in and don't let nobody talk to you. You hear? - But what about you? - No, no no. Two's too many. You go first. Where's your cart? I hid it. I've got a special way. Oh it's so hard pushing that thing, especially in winter. You ought to use a locker like me. Uh uh. My stuff stays in my cart. You find a place yet? Temporarily without. How are you feeling? Oh, so so. Hurts here sometimes. If they just let us sleep once in a while. Being out is going to kill you, Flora. And people are so mean too. How do you manage at your age? I got a gift to gab I guess. You sure do. Hope you got a cigarette too. No sirree Bob. Smoking gets your lungs. - Flora? - Oh, yeah. Yes? Yes? Just resting. That young one come in with you? Yes. She's my daughter. She's from out of town. And she's got a bus ticket. Well, hurry up and then get out of here. Oh, yes ma'am. You can come back tonight if you've got no place to sleep. Thanks a million. Well, you're all set now. You just stay here and make believe you're waiting for a bus, see? And later when it gets dark, not until, you can go downstairs and the matron will let you wash. You be careful though. There's some rough characters there at night. In the ladies room? Well, they all ain't exactly ladies. Watch out. You hear me? Watch out. Flora, will I see you again? I don't know, kid. It's a big city. Look, I gotta get back to my corner. Soon as it gets dark, somebody will try to steal my spot. I'll walk you to the door. You stay where I told you and do what I said. You girls just socializing or does somebody have a ticket? Oh, sure. She does. No I don't. Somebody's lying. Better get your story straight, girls. Come on. On your way. Come on. I thought I told you two to scram. We're going. We're going. Yeah. We're going. We're going. Well, no staying in there tonight. Flora. Flora. Did you see that? Did you see that? He wanted me to go in the back office with him. Well, at least you could have saved the cans. Flora! You have no idea what he just said to me. Oh, hey. Hey come on. What are you doing? We've got no time to cry. This life is so hard. I had no idea. Oh, honey. Stop that. It's not so bad. Don't worry. I'll find you something. Look up there. Here's your pillow. - I'm cold. - Lie down. OK, ladies. You can't sleep here. So let's be on our way. Hang on. Hang on. You gotta be careful. Bad people come here sometimes. Now stay close to me. Stay close. Is this where we stay? No, no. Engineer comes every couple hours. We'll just have to rest for a while. - Flora, are you all right? - Yeah. Flora, what's in the cart? Why? I see how much it means to you. Sonny's in the cart. Sonny? You want to see? Used to have his picture in it. But it got lost. Look. Here's his baby spoon. I got my mama's apron down there too. I used to wear it sometimes when I made supper. I used to have more but... Well, years go by you know. I wasn't always this. What were you, Flora? Tell me. I had a husband once. And Sonny. Couldn't have no more kids but that didn't matter. He was so cute. Used to call me Mommy. He loved to watch me plant things in the garden. And the dirt smelled so sweet. And Sonny smelled so sweet. What happened? Well, Sonny... Sonny god awful sick. And I was worried. Then I got sick. And they... they took me off to a hospital. And all of them expenses... you know, the doctors, and hospitals. My husband couldn't take it, I guess. When I finally came home, they was gone. They just left? Never came back. I worked for a while. I looked and I looked for them. I worked in a war plant and I cleaned houses. I kept looking but I never found them. You know, Sonny would be a man now... older than you, I guess. Looked kind of like you too... had soft hair. Did he? Yeah. Yeah, I lived in a room and then another room. And I used to get a welfare check. But then it got so bad, the place I lived. I was scared to go out, scared to stay in... people screaming in the halls. And no lock on the bathroom door... worse than a prison even. One week, my check was late and they just took my stuff like a handful of crumbs and throwed it all out. Sonny's picture and all. I got some of it back... Lost some but got some. And then I looked for a new place, but it was all worse. And once I was on the street, there was no place to get no check. So I was stuck... stuck outside with no address. And I've been there ever since. And you never heard from Sonny or your husband again? Sometimes... sometimes I see somebody. But then I think... So many years, who would even remember me? Hey, don't cry. Too late for crying. Here. You'd take care of it for me, wouldn't you? And you wouldn't let anybody see it and you wouldn't let anybody take it. And well, if anything happened to me, you'd have it and it would be like Sonny was still here, you know? Oh good. Then that's settled. Well, the engineer will be coming. We'd better go. Flora? We got no choice. Come on. Come on. Get up. What's the matter? Oh, that stuff I ate. You mean you're going to be sick? Flora? Flora? Yeah. Yeah. Right here. Right here. You feeling better? Weak and shaky with a terrible headache. I'm going to go get you some medicine. I know a guy who owns a drugstore. I'll come too. No no no no. No. I'd better alone. No, you see, this guy kind of has a crush on me. Flora, I'm scared to death of this place. I'll tell you what. Now this here's Max. They call him a census taker. And he helps us with stuff... You know, papers and things. He knows where everybody is. He'll keep an eye on you. Max, this here is Carrie. She's a friend of mine. Now you go back to sleep. And keep a good eye on the cart. You know why. OK? OK. - Welcome to the underground. - Thank you. - Flora usually travels alone. - I know. She told me. Why'd she bring you. I was robbed. Didn't she tell you that? Yeah. She said you'd been on the street. And frankly, I don't believe it. You slept in a bed last night. And you lied about it. Why? I didn't lie. She trusted you with her cart... her whole world. That's rare among the homeless. You're not one of them either. What are you doing here? I spend a lot of nights here, trying to be... trying to be around when I'm needed, trying to know what it's like to be down and out in the richest country in the world. 13,000 of them in New York alone and more every day. That couple over there lived for 25 years in an apartment that went co-op. The landlord wasn't supposed to harass them to get them out. But he did. They still get their social security check at a friend's house. But they can't afford another safe place to live. Those two ladies over there... they're sisters. And one of them is fine. The other screams and cries in the night. She was sent home from a mental hospital years ago... supposed to get treatment, never came. No rooming house will put up with the noise. And the well sister won't leave the sick one. So here they are. That woman over there got thrown out tonight. She'd given her welfare check to the landlord in advance. And when she got home, all her stuff was in the street and all her kids were in foster care. Tomorrow or the next day I'll try to find her a place to live. But for now, she's on the street. This place here is secret. Not many people know about it. Last year, a reporter stumbled upon it and wrote a story. All the entrances were sealed and everybody who slept here was thrown back on the street. I'm not a reporter. What then? I don't have to answer to you. Why should you think that I'm any different from anyone else? Oh no. I have bugs. I have bugs. That's why. Remember me? It must have been something she ate. Good. What? I mean, not that the girl got sick. God forbid. No, good that you came to me. Well, you were so nice to me that other time when I passed out from all the rotten fruit. And you gave me the pills, remember? Well, I only did what any decent person should do. I still can't believe how they let you lay there and they didn't even call an ambulance or take you to a doctor. Yeah. I guess they just thought I was drunk or crazy. Nobody with any sense would come near me. You had a fever. All I had to do was touch you. Most people don't really like to do that, Mr. B. Anyways, I just thought if you had any more of them pills. They might be packed away already. You see how it is with me, the landlord raised the rent and I lost my lease. Aw. Where will you go? Where everybody goes to die. Florida. It's nice and warm there anyways. I hate it. Nobody's under 100. I call it the last resort. Aw, come on. I bet there's lots of nice ladies there just waiting for a guy like you. From your mouth to God's ears, Florabelle. Hello, sweetheart. Pretty young thing, isn't she? Tramp you reckon? Too peachy fuzz. Run away who wants to be an actress. Yeah. I bet she's got some money. That's not all she's got. We sure are getting old. She's got head lice. You better dip her in kerosene before you touch her. Hi, sweet thing. Max? What are you calling him for? Won't we do? She's got lots of money sewn in these clothes here. Can we feel? I have a knife. Show me. I've got one too. What do you want? I'm sick. I'm contagious. You believe that? They're all saying that. Ah. Good. Thank you. People our age should say what they mean, Florabelle. Time goes by. A person, even a healthy one, may be sitting in a chair, talking and laughing even. And then in a minute, poof. We gotta make hay while the sun still shines. The sun will shine in Florida, Mr. B. I gotta get back to Carrie. Thank you. Census taker. Hurry. - What? - That girl. You leave her alone. Do not pick on the girl. Hey Carrie. Carrie, it's Max. It's Max. Carrie, are you all right? OK. Come on. Come on here to Ruby. Come on. Let me help you. There you go. And that don't hurt none, does it? Mmhmm. OK. You're going to feel a lot better when your face is all cleaned up. There. Now, come on. Right here. Come on. There we go. Here. Whoa. Nice and warm here, huh? Yeah. No, no, no, no. You don't have to talk non. You just get your strength back, OK? Yeah. Did they harm you in any way? Did they get any of your money? They took my watch. You don't need a watch down here. Big clock upstairs if you got some appointment. Shouldn't we call the police? No. We are not supposed to be down here. If they knew that we were down here, they would turn us out. Yeah. Night like this, you'd have to ride the subway. And that's real dangerous. Do you live here? Yeah. I wouldn't call it living. But I guess I do. I used to have a nice apartment but it burned down. And then there was not another one for the price so no place to go but the streets. Do you have a family or children? Do you think I want them to know that I have come down to this? Well no sirree lady. No. I'm just going to wait until I can find myself a nice apartment. And then I'm going to get me some of those little cards that you send out that says your new address on it. And then nobody will have to lose sleep over it, right? Census taker, where is everybody? On your way, lady. This place is closed. It's all right, officer. Just let me talk to her a minute, OK? - You know this lady? - Yeah. Well then you handle it. What happened? The police swept it clean. They're going to close it tomorrow. Where's Carrie? She got thrown out with all the rest. I'm just here trying to save a few things. Well, I've got pills for her. And she was minding my cart. Oh, well, your cart's right over here, Flora. Where? Oh. She left it. She must have been so scared. Uh, Flora. She's not what she seems. What are you talking about? She's just a kid. And she's got no place to go. She's got no place to go. Whoa. You can't bring that in here. I'll only be a minute. I gotta look. I gotta look. Ah. Carrie? Carrie? Carrie? Carrie? Well now, sometimes they take them down to the Delano shelter. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Mary Kellen. Are you Mary? Are you hungry? Would you like something to eat? And a bed? This is a food chit. You take this downstairs and they'll give you supper. You can decide about the bed later, OK? OK. You have to leave that here. No, no. We'll keep a good eye on it, won't we? Collin. Yeah. Come on. We can take care of that. I'll watch it for you. Everybody leaves there stuff here. All right. Come on. Right down the stairs. OK? Oh. No, wait. Wait. Come on. I'll put it in the office. How about if I put it in the office? No one will touch it there. OK? Look. Look at me. Look. It's safe here. Whoa. Uh huh. Hold it. What? You got a kid in here? Young girl wearing them blue jeans, maybe sick? Well, you can come in and take a look around. But leave the cart outside. No no no no. Please, please. Where's the rest of them? Who are you looking for? Uh, my... a kid I know. They said she might be here. And she's sick. And I got her pills. What's her name? Where's the rest? I just want to know if you got her. Look. Everybody's downstairs eating. Would you like a hot meal? Me, eat that stuff? Hell no. I just gotta find her. She's just a kid, like Sonny. Look, lady. Why don't you go downstairs, have yourself a hot meal. I'll look after the cart. No way. No way. That's how I lost Sonny's picture. Well, you are not taking this down to the cafeteria. You don't touch that. - We have rules about this. - Shut up. Leave her alone. Oh you shut up. I fight my own battles. Get that up here. I don't want your food. It tastes like garbage. I gotta look for Carrie. You get that up here. Out of my way. I'm going to call security. Security. Carrie. Carrie. Are you all right? Hey, you look different. Did they give you new clothes? How did you get here anyway? I belong here. You belong here? I work on the night shift. It's my very first job. But you said... I just got out of college. I'm still on approval. The bus is here. They said I had to learn more and that I had to go out into the field and learn about the homeless. You said you was homeless. You said that. But I let you. Maybe I was wrong. Let me get this straight. You was just using me, right? Just picking my brains, and learning from me, and laughing at me? No. And I felt sorry for you. I even showed you my cart. Everybody got your passes. Flora. I can't believe that I've been laughed at. I've been used. Do you know what just happened to me? I gave her stuff. I gave her sweaters. I gave her boots. I stuffed her shoes with paper. And I showed her things. I went across town and got her these pills. I wouldn't do to no dog what she's done to me. I... what? Please. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Ha. You think what I've been through in my life a little nothing like you could hurt me? Carrie, I want to see you in my office right now. I just want to tell you, I can't believe... I can't believe. I'm just mad at myself for being so dumb... so dumb, dumb, dumb. I went out on the street like you said I should. And I hung around and I waited. And I fed some pigeon. And you fed that old lady some hard luck story? I was robbed. I was nearly raped to keep this job. I trekked all over New York. I ruined my shoes. I lost my watch. I got lice in my hair. And you lied to her and you hurt her pride. No I didn't lie. I just didn't tell the truth. Take it easy. No. This is a mistake. It's a mistake. I'm not supposed to be on here. My cart. Will you get your big fat off me. - I ought to fire you. - I know. I ought to send you right back to that kindergarten college you came from. You think there's something so different about the homeless? A few bad breaks, a few checks that don't come... we could all be sleeping on stone pillows. You ever hear of the Great Depression? Strong men jumped out of windows to avoid with that old lady faces every day. Hey ain't you... Listen there's been a mistake. I got to get out of here. I've got... will you leave me alone? I got to get out of here. What do I do now? Nothing. Learn your lesson. Do your job. Flora's cart. She'll be yelling all the way to Brooklyn. - Brooklyn? - Yeah. She's on the bus. Still complaining about all the things she did for you, I bet. She don't want to go to Brooklyn. She'd never leave without this cart. It's no harm done. She's better off there than on the streets. Look, she'll get a good night's sleep. She'll come back tomorrow for the cart. You don't understand. Now, look, Carrie. Haven't we spent enough time on Flora? You got things to do. Do them. My cart. My cart. OK, girls. Pile out. You'll soon be safe in your nice beddy-byes. How many this trip? 19. Tonight you've got three crazies. You've got one who can't talk English and one who just threw up. Have a happy. Oh, one of the crazies is violent. This one. - I don't belong here. - Come on. I don't belong with this group. I don't belong with this group. This is kidnapping. I don't belong with a bunch of screaming Mimis. Hey listen. I don't belong here. I want to go back. I want my cart. I'm going to call you in one by one for an interview. And you can have your showers and go to bed. Is anyone here without a pass? Are you the boss? Look, I'm here by mistake. I don't need no bed. When's the next bus out? Would you sit down? Would you sit down. Your name? What difference does it make? I want to go back. I can't help you until you answer some questions. What's your name? Florabelle. Flora they call me. Age? 65 and I stopped counting. Do you have an address? Do you think I'd be mixed up in something like this if I had an address? Family? Why do you want to know that? Do you have any cash assets? Any money? Oh sure, sure, sure. I have lots of money. We put it in our safe overnight for you to protect it. We also ask you to pay for your bed if you can and if you don't need charity. I never ask for no charity. See that? $3.82. Good. Here. Well, it helps if you pay something for your bed. But that's every bit I got in the world. Anyways I don't want no bed. You want to go back on the streets? Yes. Then leave. Glad to. When's the next bus? We don't furnish transportation. If you want to leave, leave. But where am I? I don't even know this place. Hargrove Street, Brooklyn. Brooklyn? Look, there are women waiting for beds, grateful to be in out of the cold. So if you're not, the door is open. Just go. That's just what I'm going to do. I'm going to get the hell out of here. Have you any idea what it's like out there? Here. Take my money. I'll stay. But just until tomorrow. Let's move it, ladies. This will kill the lice. I ain't got no lice. You wash your hair with that stuff. Hey. Give me my garlic. What the hell do you think you're doing? These clothes have to be washed. What am I going to do? Walk around like a plucked chicken? You watch your mouth. You watch it. Ain't it cute? One more time, and you get reported to Mrs. Nelson. You're in the shelter now. You got to follow the rules. This is it. Not the Ritz, not the streets either. Don't make trouble. Breakfast call at 6 o'clock. And the bathroom's in the hall. Don't put the birds in jail. All the birds will die in jail. It's OK. Wonder what they did with their husband and kid. Get your damn hands out of my locker. She didn't... she didn't know. She didn't know. She doesn't speak English. I don't care what she speaks. She's not supposed to be in my locker. She wasn't in your locker. It's none of your business. She doesn't understand. Don't you understand? I don't care what she understands. What she doesn't understand... Keep her out of... Hey. What's going on here? Hey. It's none of your business. Well, I'll make it my business. I didn't start anything. I didn't start. You don't understand. Move it. You make trouble one more time and you're out. Could you die for that dress? And the jewelry. Look at that ring. You think it's real? Fake. Everything's fake. I can't believe you guys all watching this stuff. You got to beg for crumbs. And here you are, sitting, watching those rich people strut their stuff. Now what is the matter with you, huh? Hey. You know what you ought to do? What you ought to do is rise up in your rack. Club them to death. Yeah. Tear of their coats and their rings. Bust open the doors of their houses and eat their nice little dinner. And sleep in their nice little beds instead of watching this this... Shut up. You'll have the whole place down on us. Well, so what? I'm sick of this old filthy life. And I'm the sick of this this this charity. I want a job. I want what I had. I want a decent place of my own. Well? Well, don't deserve that? Now look what you've done. Guard! You again huh? Well, that's it. No. No wait. It's not her fault. Hargrove Shelter, intake office. It's Carrie Lang from the Delano shelter. I'm trying to reach a woman who came in on the bus about an hour ago. A lot of women came in an hour ago. Well, this one got in by mistake. Her name's Flora. And I need to get a message to her. It's important. I can't do that. Please. They're all put to bad. The lights are out up there. Would just tell her that her cart's all right and that I will call her first thing in the morning. Hey, sorry lady. This ain't a hotel. Hey. Why do they have to treat her like a criminal? It's such a big problem. People don't know how to handle it. Mostly we just do what we can. Unless it's one on one. What do you mean? One person doing for another person. You could do for her if you wanted to. You could get her inside, Carrie. How? She hates me. She'd never trust me again. You saw the way she looked. How much longer do you think she could survive out there? Even if I found a place, she wouldn't go. She hates the shelter. There are other types of shelters. Find out about them. Families that she could live with, a church or hospital. There's a lot more help out there if you just take the trouble to look. Here it is. $3.82. Don't you know how to say thanks? Sure I do. Thanks for nothing. Sonny. Sonny. Sonny. - Nelson speaking. - Yes. This is Carrie Lang from the Delano shelter. We sent you a woman last night named Flora. And I want to make sure she gets back this morning. That's impossible. She signed herself out last night. She was unruly. How could she sign herself out? Where would she go? I have no idea. Maybe she'll show up here for breakfast. Call back later and ask for Mrs. Carter. I need to know now. This is a tough job, Ms. Lang. You let these women get to you, you don't last long. Believe me. I'm off duty now. Good-bye. Max. Can I help you, miss? I'm sorry. This area is off limits. Nobody's allowed in there. Thank you, officer. Excuse me, ma'am? Do you know a woman named Flora? No. I don't know any Flora. Well, what about a man called census taker? Max? Of course I know Max. Meow. Pardon me. Thank you. Eat hardy, kid. Now, if I was a subway, where would I be? I'm a public accountant. I knew they needed help writing letters, filling out forms for social security, things like that. So I started hanging out in Grand Central just offering my services. Pretty soon I was spending a lot of time there getting to know them, sharing their lives. Makes it hard to come back to the real world, doesn't it? Whose real world? Yours? They have the same feelings you do you know. I'm sorry. I always seem to say the wrong thing to you. No. It's just that it's so easy to see them as different. The more distance we put between us, the less we have to do about it. Tell me, what will you do if you find Flora? Say I'm sorry. And try to get her off the streets. There she is. Florabelle. I'll get the cart. Flora? Max? Flora? You all right? Flora? There's no pulse. Shes dead, Carrie. No. Flora. Flora. What did she do now? Can I use your phone? We need an ambulance. I'm not surprised. Get her out of her. Officer, help. What's the problem? Flora's dead. No kidding. Hey. What's going on there? Flora. Who's in my spot? No. No, no. Don't Flora. She's dead. Oh gee. Well, did you get an ambulance or something? Yeah. I'll do that now. Flora, where have you been? Oh every place. Boy, am I hungry. Aw, gee, thanks. Well, don't just stand there like a bunch of dopes. Get her out of here. I want my corner. I'll call emergency. You can use my phone. I'll come with you. Keep your fingers off my fruit. - Where's my cart? - It's right here. We brought it for you. Please, Flora. I want to talk to you. Might as well give up. You ain't getting no more help from me. - I'm so sorry for what happened. - Oh, yeah. You're sorry. I want to help you find a home. I got all home right there. I'm talking about a real home off the streets where you can be safe. Forget it. Please, Flora. Give me a chance. Look. You want to do good? Feed the birds. There's a million people on the street. Help them. How can I when you won't even let me help you? Why do you think I took the job at the shelter in the first place? I wanted to make a difference. Please, Flora. Please let me do it for you. I know you. I know what you need. No kidding. What's that? Hope. Don't need no hope. What would have given me hope died years ago. Look, Flora. A little place with a garden. - A garden? - Yes. Where you can grow vegetables again like on the farm. Where are you going to find a place like that? I made some calls this morning. I called some friends on Long Island. They're nice people. They have a little cottage. It's nothing big and it's nothing fancy. But it's an address. It's a place of your own. How am I going to pay the rent? Saving soda cans? With an address you can start getting. Social Security checks again. Go away. Go away. How can I? How can I sleep warm anymore when you're cold? What if Sonny were here? What are you talking about? Sonny ain't here and he ain't going to be here. Go away. I can't. I want to take care of you. Wouldn't Sonny want that? Will you stop talking about Sonny? He was my kid. You ain't my kid. Yes I am. I am and you're mine. You took care of me, Flora. You wouldn't let me sleep in the cold. You found a warm place for me. Well, that was different. You was... well I'm used to it. It's been too long for me to change. Now just get out of here. Just get out of here. Go away. You got me all mixed up. You going? I give up, Flora. I don't know what else to say or do. I don't know why you won't at least try. Maybe I'm all wrong about what you want. You have a right to the life you choose. If it's there on that corner then I guess it's there on that corner. Good-bye, Florabelle. Carrie? Wait up. Wait. Wait for me.
