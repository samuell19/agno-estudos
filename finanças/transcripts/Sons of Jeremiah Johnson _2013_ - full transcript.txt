(mellow music) Voiceover: Growing up in the city during the mid-1960s proved to be quite challenging, especially for my brother Jay Jay. (mellow music) Voiceover: Our father always said, "Someday, your life is going to flash right before your eyes and you better make sure it's something worth watching. He knew that there had to be more than just working at a gas station to look forward to. (mellow music) (soaring music) Voiceover: In the last one hundred years, waves of newcomers to Alaska have challenged the land. The first newcomers that challenged the land would be pioneers and mountain men seeking riches from the land in the form of furs, timber and gold. It was a land of opportunity. The country was shrinking and there was a fortune to be made up north for any man with drive and ambition. If your dream was big enough and you had the guts to follow it, there was truly a fortune to be made. With the nation in the throes of a serious depression, my brother Jay Jay struck off northward to the vast unknown reaches of Alaska, bound to discover the mother lode of all gold finds. (gunshot sound) Voiceover: There was a driving curiosity, and it represented a new kind of country for him to see. (lively music) (owl hooting) (mellow music) (owl hooting) (mellow music) (liquid pouring) (majestic music) Voiceover: His journey started at the Alaska coast, taking him over the mountains, down a chain of lakes and rivers until reaching the forks of the mighty Susitna and Talkeetna rivers. Two hundred miles in 30 days, Jay Jay reached the mountain range dominated by a 20,000 foot mountain the native people called Denali, meaning "the great one." There was no doubt he had reached his destination. This was to be the gateway to his dreams of striking it rich. Here my brother Jay Jay decided to settle down, and build an enormous cabin. He married his childhood sweetheart, and soon had four sons. Over time, Jay Jay's wife, feeling unfit to endure the wild land, defeated by the vast reaches of space and time, left Jay Jay and headed back to New York, taking two of their four sons, leaving him alone to care for the two youngest, Jeffrey and Joshua. (splashing water) (lively music) Voiceover: The railroad opened up big Alaska, punching into the uncharted virgin wilderness once thought to be impossible. It opened up vast sections of land to homesteaders, free for the picking. (majestic music) It was the beginning and the end of imagination all at the same time. My brother took this all in stride, feeling a [unintelligible] and even bigger opportunities of reaching further into the unknown wilderness. (sound of train) (majestic music) Voiceover: The railroad provided a stable form of transportation along this primitive section of wilderness rumored to be rich in both furs and gold. My brother staked out several prime locations in the small frontier town of Talkeetna which he considered his home base. It's a place where he was well-known and respected. (majestic music) Voiceover: Talkeetna sits on the banks of three major river systems, providing both rail service and riverboat access. It happened on his annual supply run to town, just before spring break-up. He had a winter's worth of furs to be sold and a supply list a mile long - thinks like flour, salt, sugar, peanut butter, gunpowder and, of course, all the grub a person's gonna need to tide him over until the next season. His dogsled was loaded, a bit heavier than he would have liked. Nonetheless, his dogs were on fire, ready to go. (dogs barking) Jay Jay: Ready? (majestic music) Voiceover: What appeared to be a grand day for travel soon developed into one of the worst blizzards in Alaskan history, and little did he know he was on a head-on collision course with it. (majestic music) Voiceover: As he gained elevation, the wind and snow picked up. The wind was howling; the snow was blinding. Visibility was so bad, he couldn't even see his lead dogs. Soon, the mountain pass he was in was impassable, but he kept pushing on. (mellow music) Voiceover: He drove himself and his team of dogs into the unknown, which would eventually lead him to his own demise and, just like that, he was gone. Within hours of Jay Jay's disappearance, there was an emergency rescue called. Emergency search-and-rescue teams from three territories immediately set off to find my brother. (soaring music) (sound of helicopter propellers) (soaring music) Voiceover: They set up a base camp in the mountains he had last traveled. Man in hat: Okay, great; thanks for putting it together; we'll be expecting him. It's a pretty dramatic [unintelligible], so I want to get the pilots down into their spacing. (helicopter propeller sounds) (majestic music) Voiceover: Desperately searching both by air and by dog teams, they had come up empty. After several weeks of searching, they reluctantly called off the search. My brother had come to this wild land wanting to claim it for himself, but it was the land, the sheer size and extremes, that ended up claiming him. (melancholic music) (lively music) Voiceover: News of the recovery that summer was immediately felt by the three sons in New York. John, the oldest, was in shock, and just wasn't able to handle the news. (lively music) Voiceover: Joseph was in college when the news of his father came, hitting him particularly hard. For him, leaving New York wasn't a possibility, one he would have to live with. He was devastated. (lively music) Voiceover: Joshua, who had come back from Alaska some years earlier, left for Alaska immediately to deal with his father's will and other issues involved with his death. He also was looking forward to seeing his youngest brother, who he had always been so close to. (lively music) (sound of plane) (lively music) (door of plane opens) Joshua: Thank you; which way to town? Man in jacket: Just take the trail up there and head north. That'll take you right to it. Joshua: Thank you. (lively music) (lively music) Woman: Hey there, what can I get ya? Joshua: A beer. Woman: A beer comin' up. Joshua: Ah, thank you. So, where can a guy go to get some sleep around here? Woman: You need a room? Joshua: Yeah. Woman: Okay, you want the roadhouse just down the street. Joshua: Oh, thank you. So, is it true there's gold here? (laughs quietly) How long did it take you to dig this up? Man in hat: All day yesterday and the better part of this morning. Joshua: Amazing. Man in hat: So, how you doing? Joshua: I'm doing well, thank you. Man in hat: Where you from? Joshua: New York. Man in hat: New York? Joshua: Yeah. Man in hat: New York City? Joshua: The one and only. Man in hat: Oh, my God. Joshua: I know; I never thought I'd come here. (lively music) (poker chips hitting table) (lively music) (sound of poker chips) (lively music) (man trips, drops bucket) (men's laughter) Man at bar: You dropped your bucket, boy! Joshua: Hey, jackass! Man #1: Yeah, what is it, pretty boy? Joshua: What's your problem? Didn't your mother teach you any manners? Man #1: We're just having some fun with the punk. Joshua: Yeah? Why don't you have a little fun with me? (sounds of men fighting) (resounding music) (mellow music) Woman at desk: Yes, sir, your usual room. Good day. Good after noon, sir. Joshua: Good afternoon; the lady at the Fairview said you might be able to help me. I need a room. Woman at desk: How very kind of her. I do rent rooms, upstairs at the end of the hall, $50 a night, if you're not permanent. Joshua: Oh, I'm not permanent; I'm only going to be here about a day or two. Woman: Parlor's yours to use; mind your volume. Mind your volume; I do have other renters. They're staying downstairs, two railroad workers and a schoolteacher. Coffee's always on; mind yourself on the stairs. The stairs are older than I am, and I'm just as creaky. Your room's this way, but this is the bathroom right through here. Joshua: Oh, I thought that's what that was. Woman: I trust you know how it all works. Joshua: I'm fairly certain. Woman: And here's the room. Watch your head; I do not have time for a lawsuit. Joshua: This is very nice. If you don't mind, I'll take my meals in here. One more thing - what time does the train leave tomorrow? Woman: You'll want to be at the depot at 11:00. It leaves at 11:20, heads north. Joshua: Thank you very much. (running water sound) (knocking sound) Voiceover: If you don't want to miss that train, you better get moving. Joshua: Thank you. Voiceover: After a night at the roadhouse, my nephew Joshua struck off with plans of catching the train north to his father's cabin, one of the last cabins he remembered before returning to New York some years before his father's death. Man: Hey, are you Joshua? We got a telegram. Voiceover: My brother's youngest son Jeffrey, aware of Joshua's return, sent him a telegram to meet him at the forks of the two rivers just outside of town. (train whistle) Man #1: I think I see him going down the alley right now. Let's go follow him and see where he goes. (train whistles) Man #1: There he goes. (lively music) (sound of boat motor) (Joshua reacts to train whistle) (resounding music) Man #1: Whoa, whoa, there he is. Man #2: Yeah, bet he's gonna meet with his brother. You think he saw us? Man #1: No, he doesn't know what's going on. City slicker didn't see shit. Man #2: You know, that punk mighta got the best of us in the bar yesterday, but next time we won't be drunk and then we'll see what happens. We'll be all over that boy. Second man: Look at that smug son of a bitch over there. Man #1: I know. Man #2: He's gonna have a little nap by the river. Well, he may never wake up. (laughs quietly) Man #1: Where's his brother? Man #2: I don't know; he'll be here soon enough. They'll get theirs. He come down from New York City, the fancy city boy. Man #1: I've had my eye on their land up there for a while. Man #2: Yeah, no kidding, man. Think there's actually gold on theirs, opposed to our weak-assed claims? Voiceover: Finding a spot on the bank of the river, Joshua soon dozed off with thoughts of his early childhood running through his head. (mellow music) Voiceover: He remembered his little brother Jeff as they ran [unintelligible], helping feed the sled dogs with their dad. (dogs barking) Voiceover: Following in his dad's footsteps, becoming an accomplished dog musher himself, just like his dad. (mellow music) (dogs barking) (mellow music) Voiceover: He also carried on the traditional ways of log building, as well as becoming a great fisherman. They were obviously brothers from the same blood; that was a given. (mellow music) (bird sounds) (mellow music) (splashing water) (mellow music) Jeff: Joshua; Joshua, it's me! Hey, it's me, your brother; Joshua, get up! (happy laughter) Jeff: Man, it's been a long time! Joshua: It's been too long; look at you - fit and trim, huh? Jeff: You look great; you look great, too. Joshua: Thank you; thank you. Jeff: Let's get after this, huh? Joshua: Let's do it, man. Jeff: Nice to see ya. Man #1: Those are Jay Jay Johnson's kids, right; Jeffrey? Man #2: Uh huh, uh huh. Man #1: That's his brother over there [unintelligible]. When they read his will, they're gonna be on that land. I always had my eye on that, ya know. Man #2: Yeah, I don't need no company up in our neck of the woods. Man #1: Damn right; it'll be awful crowded up there real soon. Man #2: Yeah, tell me about it. Man #1: Think we may, uh, have to take care of this problem. Man #2: I think we can think of a thing or two to solve our little issue here with the Johnson boys. Man #1: That's right. When they read that will, they're gonna have to get some ideas. Man #2: Well, I've got an idea or two. Man #1: I've got one or two myself. Man #2: Uh huh. Joshua: Say, did you ever see those guys before? Jeff: No; I don't care for that type much. Joshua: Yeah, let's go. Jeff: I can't believe your first night here, you already got yourself in a mess of trouble with them guys. Tell me about it. Joshua: Well, you know, it just seems to follow me, you know. You know those two guys I pointed out to you? Jeff: Yeah. Joshua: That was them. Jeff: Oh, that riff-raff there. Joshua: Yeah, I was at the Fairview and they just tripped this kid that was walking around. I couldn't just let that go. Jeff: See, that's the problem I have with this community, the riff-raff that seem to be collecting a little more. It's good to have some good, honest new guys comin' into town to show some honest goodness around here. Joshua: Right; you have my back, though, right? Jeff: I got you; I got you, bud. (both laugh quietly) Jeff: Just like old times. Joshua: Yep, you know it. (mellow music) (birds singing) (mellow music) Joshua: Well, look who's here. Hey, pal. Jeff: How ya doin'? Joshua: I made it. Jeff: You did; nice to see ya, just in time for dinner, too, I see. Joshua: Ah, thank God; I'm starving. Jeff: Well, as you see, we got some bear meat here. Joshua: Bear meat? Jeff: I know you don't like seein' 'em, but - Joshua: Did you shoot this bear yourself? Jeff: I did; I had to; I didn't really want to. It was more of a need than a want. Yeah, there was not a way that I was gonna let this bear get into it. He's been giving me a problem the last coupla years, so his time was due. Joshua: Well, you know, Dad was a heck of a guy, huh? Jeff: Yeah, yep; you guys are a lot alike. Joshua: Really? Jeff: A lot alike. Quite a few years ago, we had a bear that broke in the camp here and started gettin' into our cache. Same thing; we cooked up the bear [unintelligible], sitting over a fire, and I tell you what, just you being here with me right now is just so much similar to Dad bein' here that, even though you didn't get along with him and you guys didn't see eye-to-eye all the time, the genetics really pulled through. You guys are so parallel together, it's just incredible. You know, the genetics really did pull through. Joshua: Well, maybe that's why me and him never really saw eye-to-eye, you know? Jeff: Maybe; maybe, you guys are too similar. Joshua: Yeah, the old hard head. (both men laughing) Jeff: Well, we loved the guy. Joshua: Yeah. Jeff: God rest his soul. (mellow music) Jeff: All right, I'm gonna get some more wood here. Joshua: All right. (mellow music) Jeff: Ah, lovely. Joshua: How's that bear coming? Jeff: The bear; it could use a little bit longer, a little bit longer. Joshua: I still can't believe that people eat bear. Jeff: Aw, man, you been in the city too long. Joshua: Yeah. Jeff: Welcome home. Joshua: You know, it has been years since I've sat around an outdoor fire. Jeff: Really? Joshua: Yeah, you know, in the city - Jeff: What do ya do? Joshua: Yeah, everyone's just in a hole in the wall in some building. Everyone has the same heat. Heat is a button on the wall you push. It's convenient but it's soulless, you know? There's no freedom to it. So, are the salmon running yet? Jeff: Not for a couple of weeks, but when they come in, they're gonna come in pretty heavy and I could really use your help if you're gonna be around. Joshua: They're gonna come in force, huh? Jeff: Force; just like these mosquitoes. Joshua: Oh, yeah. Jeff: I bet you didn't miss these big - Joshua: Not at all. Jeff: How's that; that enough for ya? Joshua: I think that'll do for right now. You know, don't take this the wrong way, but I'm kinda glad that he's not around to hear me admit that he was right about Sheila. Jeff: Sheila. Joshua: That was the last argument me and him had. Jeff: Yeah. Joshua: The whole reason I moved to New York; the biggest mistake of my life. Jeff: Whatever happened to Sheila? Joshua: She ran off with some guy named Moe, Moe Lunt. Yeah, what I wouldn't give to go back and fix things with Dad, you know? Jeff: Yeah. Joshua: That last argument we had just. - I'll never get to tell him "sorry." Jeff: Yeah. Joshua: Some of my greatest memories of me and him were fishing. Jeff: Oh, absolutely. Joshua: I haven't had a lot of time to do that, a lot of opportunity, You know, living in New York City, you don't get to do that a whole lot. Jeff: You don't get a chance. You don't get a chance to swat mosquitoes, walk in a river, catch a salmon. Joshua: I've missed it. Jeff: So, tell me about those two others guys at the bar the other night. Joshua: Oh well, you know, I run into people like that all the time in New York. You know, people there don't believe in manners anymore. I was getting sick of it. I was actually kind of glad to come to Alaska to kinda get away from them, then that's like the first thing I run into. Jeff: Yeah, come to think about it, I do remember seeing those guys up the tracks quite a while ago, but the worst part about that is that's where our claim is, and that's where we're gonna be goin'. There might be a chance that we're gonna run into those guys again. Joshua: Ah, that'd be very unfortunate for them. Jeff: While you're here, I know you've taken care of business with them, but now I would assume that they're gonna be gettin' really mad and greedy, and if they're going up that way, they're goin' up that way for one reason and one reason only, and that's no good. That's where Dad's claim is, and that's where we're gonna be goin'. Joshua: Well, I wouldn't worry about them too much. Jeff: I'm glad that you came around, brother, to knock those guys around a little bit, and show 'em who's boss in town here. Joshua: How do they get up there? Jeff: There's actually a flagstop train that heads up north about 60 miles, where people can wave and they can get dropped off or they can get picked up along the railroad tracks. Joshua: Is that the way we're going? Jeff: Yep. Joshua: Well, I'm really glad I made it here. Jeff: Just in time; perfect, perfect. I'm gonna get goin'. I've gotta get home and take care of my chores - dog chores. Upstairs in the cache, Dad's got a bed upstairs there. Joshua: A bed, really? Jeff: That's your spot. Joshua: He put a bed in the cache? Jeff: That's his little hideout. Joshua: He thought of everything, didn't he? Jeff: Oh, yeah; anyway, buddy, I'll catch up with ya in the morning. Joshua: Sleep well. Jeff: Right, you have a good night. Joshua: Yeah, I'll try. (majestic music) Joshua: Bear, huh? (majestic music) Joshua: Not as bad as I thought it'd be. I'm gonna sleep like the dead tonight. (suspenseful music) Man #1: Aw, shit! (sounds of men fighting) Man #2: That'll teach them Johnson boys. Man: I knew your dad, and I grew up with your dad as a kid. Your dad and I climbed McKinley together. We hunted together; we fished together. We took many adventures together. Joshua: There's so much about him that I don't really know. I never really knew him. Man: He was a hell of a man; he was a heck of a guy. We're gonna miss him. Diana, do you have Johnson's file, by chance? Diana: Yes, I do; here it is, sir. Man: All right, thank you. You know, your dad was quite the adventurer. We climbed McKinley together back in the day. We've been on a lot of different rafting trips. You know, your dad owns a lot of gold claims in the state of Alaska - I mean a ton. Joshua: I had heard that, yeah. I haven't been there but my brother Jeff has. Man: Sure, you know, looking at the provisions of your dad's will, I'd say you're in for quite a ride. What your dad has done with all of these gold claims he has, he's basically set up a maze for you to go through, location to location, with clues to find your way along this journey. Whoever gets through this maze, essentially, will find the gold at the end of the rainbow. It also goes on to say, "If this treasure is not found, "claimed and recorded with a one-month time period, "it then becomes open, fair game, to any such person who dare takes on the challenge." Joshua: Laughs. That sounds like something Dad would do. It also sounds like a lot of fun. Man: Maps to the gold mines. Joshua: I don't even know how to read this gibberish. Man: This was your dad's doing. Your dad set this up this way. He wants you and your brothers to work on the clues and to find the treasure. It's up to you guys. Joshua: Laughs; maybe Jeff can read it. Man: I got something else here for ya, Joshua. Your dad, back in the day, took down this rogue grizzly with a single shot from a Smith and Wesson .44. Joshua: Laughs; I can't believe it. I hate bears, and he knew that; and he leaves me this - hmm. Man: Your dad was a hell of a man. (phone rings) Man: Hmm, it's the hospital. Hello; yes, yes he is. Yes, hold on one moment. Joshua: Is he all right? I'll be right there. My brother isn't here because he got the crap beat out of him last night; he's in the hospital. Man: Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. Joshua: No, I've gotta go. Man: Well, listen, before you leave, your father has a good friend by the name of Alex. He's a native Alaskan, and he can help you on this journey. You can probably find Alex at one of your dad's old cabins. Probably the best one to check first would be his old cabin at the confluence of the Talkeetna, the Chulitna, and the Susitna river. Joshua: Thank you very much. Man: Good luck to you. Joshua: Yes; I gotta go. (mellow music) (man releases arrow from bow) (mellow music) Joshua: Anybody home? Hey; hey! Are you Alex? Alex: Yes. Joshua: Are you friends with Jay Jay Johnson? Alex: Yes, who are you? Joshua: I'm his son, Joshua. I've been looking for you; I heard you were here. Alex: Well, you found me. Joshua, I miss your dad a lot. [That's where I live.] Joshua: Nice duck. Alex: It's what I got with my hunting bow today. Joshua: You got that today? Alex: Yes, from the river. Your dad believed life is to be lived. Joshua: Hmm, is that bread? Alex: Yeah, that's [unintelligible]. Joshua: What is it? Alex: [Unintelligible], bread, grouse and ducks. Joshua: You and my dad, you guys made it out here, right? Alex: Yes. Joshua: Yeah, you knew him best; you were his best friend, right? Alex: Yes, him and I hunt together, survived together. Then, at last, I heard he was dead. Joshua: At my father's will reading, he gave me a map that led to all his claims. Alex: I know all those places. In two days, I can take you there; be ready. Joshua: I'm glad because I can't read them. They're like Greek to me. Alex: Your father write 'em. Joshua: Keep your eyes open, Alex. There may be some bad guys looking for ya. If they get ahold of you, they're gonna hurt you, like they did my brother Jeff. As long as I'm with you, you're okay, all right? But when you're away from me, be on your guard. This scum will stop at nothing. They're gonna try and get to my father's claims before I do. I wouldn't be surprised if they're following me now, so just be careful. Alex: I will. (melancholic music) (bird sounds) (melancholic music) (bird sounds) (melancholic music) Voiceover: The first part of the journey for Joshua and Alex was to follow the Hatcher Pass trail, which led them 33 miles from Tidewater up to the 4,000 foot Hatcher Pass and the headwaters of the Talkeetna River. (melancholic music and singing) Alex: That [unintelligible] cabin [unintelligible]. (majestic singing) Joshua: So where are we on the maps here? Alex: We're right there, [Unintelligible]. Joshua: Right here? Alex: [Unintelligible], yeah. Joshua: Okay, and that's this way? Alex: Yes. Joshua: All right, let's go. (lively music) Joshua: How about right here? (splashing water) (lively music) (sound of digging) (rushing water) (majestic music) (rushing water) (majestic music) Joshua: And that's where we're going, that way? It's that way, you're sure? You're sure about this? Okay, let's go. (majestic music) Joshua: We have to cross this? Shit! (majestic music) Uhhh! (majestic music) Voiceover: After 16 miles, they had reached the ultimate test, a steep 1,000 foot climb up to the summit of Hatcher Pass. (mellow music) Voiceover: Desperate to reach the gold fields, they pressed their luck through rain, fog and snow. (lively music) Voiceover: Two weeks had passed and they had little, if any, luck gold-panning, trying to find any kind of color from the creek beds. Most would have turned back along the way, but they continued on, bound to find his father's treasure. (splashing water) Joshua: Hey, I have something! Alex: Gold! (thunder) Joshua: It's gonna really storm here, isn't it? Alex: Yes, those are rain clouds. Joshua: How do you tell the difference between rain and snow clouds? Alex: Because they'e Grey. Joshua: I see. (majestic music) (birds singing) (majestic music) Joshua: What a piece of shit! Looks like the bears got into this. My dad lived in this thing? What kind of clue am I supposed to find here? The clue must be that a bear got into all of his shit, and we're not gonna get any. The place looks like it's been destroyed for like a year or so. The valley is pretty. Alex: It's pretty. It sure was a nice cabin before the bears got into it. Joshua: Why did you guys come here? What was this cabin's purpose? Alex: Wolves and wolverines. Joshua: You hunted wolves? Alex: Yes, trapping. Joshua: Trapping. Alex: Yes. Joshua: I think I got what my dad's trying to tell me here. (majestic music) (rushing water) (lively music) Joshua: He wanted to live here, in this little house? Alex: Yes. Joshua: You been here many times? Alex: Yes, with your father. He built his cabin for gold mining. Joshua: For gold mining? Alex: Yes, there's gold back there. Joshua: You and him are gold-mining here? Alex: Yes. Joshua: His claim's up there? Well, that's it; no wonder he wanted to live here. It's near his gold claims. Alex: Yes. Joshua: The treasure he spoke of. Alex: It's in the Pass; it's there for you. Joshua: Laughs. We're just about there. (majestic music) Alex: Do you know this is the Independence Mine? Your dad used to live there. Joshua: There? Alex: Yes, the bunker house. Joshua: What, for the miners? Alex: Yes. Joshua: Did my father work here? Alex: Yes, he was an Independence worker. Joshua: Independence worker. Alex: Yes. Joshua: Huh. (majestic music) Joshua: Hey, Alex, where are ya, man? We're burning daylight! I told him to be careful. You okay, man? Are you all right? They got him. (sound of boat) (majestic music) Man in hat: Hey, hello there! Joshua: I'm looking for a way to get upriver. Man in hat: Well, you'll need a power boat, jet boat, something. Joshua: Where can a person get one? Man in hat: This guy up here will rent you one. Joshua: Sounds good. Man in hat: This is the ticket for what you'll need. This guy can hook you up. Man: Howdy, Sim Smith. Joshua: Joshua Johnson. Sim: What can I do for ya? Joshua: I'm looking for a way to get to my dad's cabin upriver. Sim: Well, I can take you up there; how far ya gotta go? Joshua: About 20 miles. Sim: Well, the rate for something like that would be a hundred and fifty bucks for a drop-off and pick-up. Joshua: I can do that. Sim: Great; where ya need to go? Joshua: Oh, I'd recognize the landing. What do ya got up here? Sim: That's just Mad Dog's place. He's got a store; you can get your provisions there if you need. Joshua: Yeah, I'm probably gonna need to stock up on some stuff if I'm gonna go to my dad's cabin, so why don't we just go on up there? I need some bacon, five pounds of beef jerky, some coffee. When we get there, there won't be any reason to go inside. We can just talk to him through the door. So, you were at the Fairview the other night? Sim: Yeah, you're that guy from New York, right? I remember you're the guy that whipped on those young rive rats there. Joshua: That was me. Sim: What are you up to now? Joshua: Oh, I got this map in my dad's will. It's supposed to lead to his gold, and I have 30 days from the time I get this to get it. Otherwise, it becomes public, you know. I've been here; I've been there, and I've been there, but I haven't found this place yet. Sim: Oh, okay, well I'm familiar with these areas here. This one's a little tougher to get to. You've got a couple choices. You can take a riverboat, but I guess there isn't a lot of those guys around right now, so I'd take the train, and you jump on the train and run north. You get off here, right in this area here next to the tracks. He had a lot of stuff around the area. It's definitely worth takin' a look at. It might be good to find someone to help get you to where you want to go. Joshua: I had Alex. Sim: What happened to Alex? Joshua: He was taken care of. Sim: Oh? Joshua: Yeah. Sim: Could it have been them river rats, ya think? Joshua: Yeah, that's what I think. Sim: Well, it makes sense, 'cause they been raising hell all over these parts for the last couple of years off and on. I wish somebody'd just take care of 'em. You know, that'd probably be the thing to do but you know how that goes. Joshua: I'm startin' to come around to that way of thinking myself. Sim: Yeah, I reckon. Sim: Here, why don't you take this with ya, because you need to be prepared for 'em, 'cause I know they're looking for ya. Joshua: Yeah, well, I'm ready for them. (train sound) (mellow music) (train whistle) (mellow music) Man on train: Well, good luck! Joshua: Thank you. Man on train: You're welcome. (mellow music) (mellow music) Joshua: I think I'm starting to get it, Dad. (mellow music) (splashing water) Man #1: I think this is it. Man #2: Yeah? Man #1: Yeah, definitely. Man #2: Sweet! Man #1: Johnson's cabin; check this place out, dude! Man #2: Is it locked? Man #1: No! Man #2: Huh huh, dumbass! Man #1: All right, let's see what we got; we probably don't have long. Man #2: No, if the door's open, he's probably around. Man #1: All right, let's see; oh, here's a bag; nice! Man #2: I think that's like everything he owns. Man #1: Pretty sure, yeah. Man #2: Nice! Man #1: He's got it with him all the time. Man #2: That'll show him. I'll tell you what, I'll look out back and see if he's got anything out there. Man #1: All right, cool, cool; I'll check it out here. (splashing water) (suspenseful music) Man #2: Nothing back there; did you find anything else? Man #1: Not really, just odds and ends. Man #2: Okay, well, we probably got another minute or so. Man #1: Oh, what's that? Man #2: Paydirt! Man #1: Hey, sweet, here! Man #2: I'll go stow this with the rest. Man #1: All right, good; got his bag. (suspenseful music) Man #1: Oh, hey listen, calm down; calm down a second, hey! Listen, calm down. Just take a minute. Joshua: You know, you and your rat-bastard friend have done nothing but cause me trouble since I got here. You sent my brother to the hospital. I find you in my father's cabin stealing my stuff. Man #1: I don't know whose place this is! Man #2: Come on, let's go! (suspenseful music) Joshua: Uh, aww! Dad, now I know why you gave this to me. (suspenseful music) Man #2: It's a good thing we found this raft to get back to town. We'd have been walking for days. Man #1: Yeah, poor bastard, just leavin' it out for anybody. Man #2: Yeah, time to go cash in some of this gold. Man #1: Maybe we can finally get some cash for this. Man #2: Yeah. (suspenseful music) Man #1: That was a damn waste of time. Man #2: Don't I know it. (sound of motorboat) (suspenseful music) Man #2: Sure am glad Ted filled us in on that clause in old man Johsnon's will. Man #1: Yeah, we caught a break there. Thirty days it expires, right? Man #2: Mm hmm, if any of them Johnson boys are still alive in 30 days, they're gonna wish they weren't. Man #1: We oughta hurry up in any case. I don't much like the idea of sharing that claim. Man #2: Well, if anybody else shows up, we'll just take care of them the same way. Hey, hey, isn't that one of the Johnson boys right there? Man #1: Let's go. (suspenseful music) Joshua: Bastards! (suspenseful music) (splashing water) (dramatic music) Man #2: There's no way he followed us up this far. Man #1: Hey, they left some canoes. Man #2: Yeah, they did. Man #1: He's goin' by land; why don't we just cut across? Man #2: Okay. Man #1: Beat him over. Man #2: Well, let's find the paddles; gotta be around here somewhere, right? Man #1: Yeah. Man #2: Son of a bitch. Man #1: Locked? Man #2: Yeah. Man #1: Smarter than the guy with the raft, at least. Well, we can't always be lucky. Man #2: Well, let's see, it's probably best if we just head off that way and loop back around. He'll probably follow the trail that way, and we'll just bushwhack through here. We'll still stay ahead of him. Man #1: All right. (dramatic music) Man #2: That Jeff never even saw us comin', did he? Man #1: No, he did not. That Alex kid, he was even easier to take care of. Man #2: Laughs; tell me about it. This guy, though, there's something. - Something different about him. Man #1: The New Yorker? Man #2: Yeah. Man #1: Yeah. Man #2: He's got this tendency to make my life a little more complicated than I tend to prefer. Man #1: Yeah, well, we'll take care of him. He's a little different, though. Man #2: There's no way he followed us up this far. Man:#1 I tell ya, you with that two-by-four - Man #2: Yeah, he's not so tough with lumber upside his head. Man #1: We caught him off guard at the cabin. Man #2: Yeah, tell you what, if he's still following us, he's probably out there in the woods holding his map upside down. Man #1: Shit, we got his bag; he ain't got crap! Man #2: Oh, yeah, we got his map now! Man #1: Yeah, I almost feel bad for that poor son of a bitch. Man #2: Not me; he got what was comin' to him. If he comes back, he's gonna get some more. Man #1: Damn right. Man #2: If the bears don't find him first. What do ya say we head down to the river and set up camp for the night? There ain't no way he's gonna follow us all the way down there. Man #1: No, it seems safe enough; I'm gettin' tired of breakin' bush. Man #2: No kiddin' - much better at breakin' necks. (rushing water) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (dramatic music) (rushing water) (dramatic music) (crackling fire) (dramatic music) Man #1: All right, let's get the hell outta here. Man #2: Sure hope Ted gets here soon; that weather's comin' in. Man #1: Yeah. Man #2: All right, here, you go grab the rest of it; I need to get somethin' out of this one. Man #1: All right, back in a second. (dramatic music) Man #2: Shit! Joshua: You ain't goin' anywhere. Man #2: That's what you think! Joshua: Bullshit! Man #2: Oh! (sound of gunshot) Joshua: Hey, brother! Jeff: Watch out! (sound of gunshot) (dramatic music) Joshua: Brother! Jeff: Hey, brother! Joshua: You had my back. Jeff: Always. Joshua: Wow, how long have you been following me? Jeff: I've been following you ever since over the Pass. Joshua: Really? Jeff: Yeah, Granite Pass, up that way; I saw you up from the top. I didn't mess around, though; I just knew you needed help. Joshua: No; guess you did, and you were right. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Joshua: Hey, pal, come have a seat. Jeff: How ya doin'? Joshua: This was Alex's favorite spot. He would sit here for hours just lookin' at the lake. This bench was built for him, in fact. Jeff: Really? Joshua: Mm hmm, he wanted his ashes scattered here, so I wanted to come back here one more time, just to say good-bye before I had to go. Jeff: Yeah. Joshua: Believe me, I really don't want to. Jeff: Yeah, it's gonna be sad to see you go. Yeah, it's been exciting. Joshua: Well, you know, there was something that our father was trying to teach me throughout this whole ordeal. That treasure he spoke of, it wasn't money. Jeff: It wasn't money. Joshua: It wasn't gold; it was being alive. That's what he understood, and when I think about how I used to exist in New York, you know, that wasn't living; that was subsisting. And this - well, there's no comparison. There's a richness here, a value. Jeff: Yeah, bein' alive. Joshua: It's the very breath in your lungs, and that's something that he understood, and that's something that our brothers need to know. That's why I have to go back. I have to go get them. Jeff: Yeah, it's too bad that you couldn't stick around a little bit longer. Joshua: Yeah, believe me, the last thing in the world I want to do now is leave, but I have to go back and clear some things up. John and Joseph, they need to come up here. Jeff: Yeah, it'd be nice to see our other brothers get back home. Joshua: There's something that our father taught me of this whole thing, that I now need to make sure they know, so I'll be back. Jeff: We'll be ready. Joshua: The Johnson boys together again. Jeff: Together again. Joshua: Watching each other's backs, just like old times, huh? Jeff: Just like old times. Joshua: Hey, how ya doin', after that beating? Jeff: I'm doin' fine. Joshua: You doin' okay? Jeff: Yeah. Joshua: Your leg still botherin' you? Jeff: A little bit; I'm not doin' too bad; I'm gettin' better. It did bother me a little bit, but what really makes me feel better is the hurtin' that we put on them two old boys. Joshua: Yeah, that's good medicine right there, yeah. Jeff: laughs Joshua: It's been a crazy few months, huh? Jeff: Mm hmm. Joshua: You know? Jeff: Fun-packed! Joshua: It's been a blast. Jeff: I don't know; might be kinda scary next time you come up. Joshua: Oh, I don't think so. Jeff: We had so much fun this time. Joshua: I'm ready for it, you know? Jeff: We'll get all of us together this time; we'll be good. (dramatic music) (rushing water) (dramatic music) Jeff: From the smoke - did you see that or not? Voiceover:: At what point, though? Jeff: When you're shootin' Eric and me, is there smoke, kinda like a haze here? Voiceover: I don't remember. Right now, you mean? Jeff: Yeah. Voiceover: I don't know. Jeff: Well, you'd know right away, so - Voiceover: Look at each other. Jeff: Look at each other? Voiceover: Yeah. Jeff: Hey, baby. How you doin'? Joshua: Come here often? Where have you been all my life? Jeff: You at McDonald's today, 'cause I'm lovin' it! Joshua: You know, if I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together. Jeff: I never heard that one. Joshua: Never, really? Jeff: Oh, man! Joshua: That is THE classic one. Jeff: That's good; I heard that McDonald's one on a bus down in Juneau.
