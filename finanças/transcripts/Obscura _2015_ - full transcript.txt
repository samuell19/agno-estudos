(gentle music) (grass rustling) (zipper zipping) (gentle music) - Okay, I'm Professor Penn. I wanna welcome you to Conceptional Art Design and their Modern Methods. I wanna find out from each of you what you intend to get out of this class. (gentle music) What is the medium that you enjoy? Is is modern? Do you even like art? Or are you using this just for another credit? There are no wrong answers, so you can be totally, totally honest. (birds chirping) (gentle music) Okay, I'll start. I love art. In fact, my favorite artist is a local man. His name is Mitchel Burndry, and I have sent each of you on your student emails samples of his work so you get the idea. (birds chirping) (gentle music) You. Okay, what medium do you use? - Watercolors. - I like it. And you, Sir? - Graffiti, I guess. I don't know. - And you? (pensive music) - Photography. (crickets chirping) (pensive music) (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) (brakes squealing) (mellow music) (birds chirping) (keys jingling) (mellow music) (door creaks) (mellow music) (liquid splashing) (mellow music) (cereal clattering) (mellow music) (water splashing) (mellow music) (door creaking) (mellow music) (shutter clicks) (pensive music) (air whooshing) (pensive music) (Andrew exhales) (pensive music) (shutter clicking) (pensive music) (patrons chattering) (mellow music) - Andrew? Go talk to that girl, man. Please? - No, man, not tonight. No. - You need to get out there. - It's a bad idea. - [Ryan] And that girl was fuckin' hot, come on. (patrons chattering) (mellow music) - All right. - [Ryan] Please? (patrons chattering) (mellow music) - Will you watch this? - [Ryan] I will. (patrons chattering) (mellow music) - Did I look lonely to you? - My friend Ryan over there wanted me to ask you out. (chuckles) (patrons chattering) (mellow music) - So, what do you do? - Uh, I'm studying art. More specifically, photography. - Really? - Yeah. - I'm an art major. - How have I not seen you around? Do you go to SOC? - Um, it's her sister school. - No shame in community college. (patrons chattering) (mellow music) Can I get another vodka over here, also a water? (patrons chattering) (mellow music) - Thank you. (mellow music) (patrons chattering) What do you usually take pictures of? - (throat clears) Usually landscape stuff. (girl laughs) - [Girl] Is that interesting to you? - It is, yeah. I mean, I can do portrait stuff as well, but I just mainly like taking pictures of things that don't move. - Oh. - Capture most out of it. (girl chuckles) - So, I guess that means that you don't wanna take my picture then, huh? - No, you're right, I don't wanna take your picture. - Ouch. - You're too pretty for a picture. (patrons chattering) (mellow music) - [Girl] Okay. I've fallen for your pickup lines that don't exist. - Perfect, then you can come take a walk with me. Listen, I'm gonna go have a smoke. Will I see you out there? Okay. (patrons chattering) (mellow music) (music fades) - So, what happened, man? Did you scare her off? - Do you wanna know how to get the attention of a puppy dog? (Ryan exhales) (Andrew exhales) Confidence. - Well, yeah, but what about that one? - Like I said, it's a bad idea. (pensive music) (crickets chirping) (woman exhales softly) (pensive music) (crickets chirping) (fumes hissing) (pensive music) (woman exhaling softly) (pensive music) (Andrew exhales) (crickets chirping) (mellow music) (engines rumbling) - I need to talk to you a few minutes about something on page 14. - Oh. - Do you wanna come with me? Okay, no big deal. Oh, and Andrew, hang in there 'cause I got something else to talk to you about, too. (mellow music) (phones ringing) - [Jill] Coffee? - Yeah. Thank you. (cup thuds) (mellow music) (crickets chirping) (keys jingling) (mellow music) (computer chimes) (mellow music) (fridge door thuds) (shop bell rings) (bottles clinking) - That's not very good. - I don't need it to be good, I just need it to be right now. (Marissa chuckles) Do you have a suggestion, then? - Yeah. (bottles clinking) - I don't know if I should be taking advice from strangers in the middle of the night. - My name's Marissa. Now we're not strangers. - I'm Andrew. (bottles clinking) (register beeps) (crickets chirping) (mellow music) (liquid sloshing) (mellow music) - So, what do you do? (Andrew's throat clears) - I work for the "Southern Oregon Journal," actually. Like news, headlines, ads, pictures, mainly. Kinda whatever it is they throw at me. - That's really cool. - Well (chuckles). - Is that why you carry the camera? - Yeah, it's exactly why I carry the camera (chuckles). - You should let me take your picture. - No. (Marissa chuckles) - No? - No. Photographers don't necessarily like getting their picture taken. I mean, you don't like paint the painter. We just don't tend to show up well on film (chuckles). - Well, the painter's getting painted tonight. - Is there no way, like I can get out of this? - No. - Okay. Just one picture. - Okay. (mellow music) (crickets chirping) Thank you. (lever winding) Ready? - I guess (throat clears). (Andrew sighs) (camera clicks) - Beautiful. (mellow music) (doors slamming) - Well, what is it that you do? - I'm a teacher. - Oh. (lighter flicking) - Yeah, kindergarten. - Okay. - That's a handful (laughs), but- - I bet. Enjoy that? - I do, I love my job. - That's good. It's good to enjoy, enjoy what you do everyday. - Do you like what you do? - Do I like what I do? It has its moments. It's a job. I used to like it. - Yeah. - Do you usually go around in the middle of the night talkin' to random people? Is that just a new thing you're tryin' out? - Always. - Always. - No (chuckles). (mellow music) (crickets chirping) - This is nice. - It is. Do you come here often? - No, I don't but I don't really get out often, so. (Marissa's throat clears) - And this is getting out? - For me, this, yeah. (Marissa laughs) - You should probably get out more often. (Andrew's throat clears) - I should. (Marissa chuckles) So, do you live around here or? - Kind of. - Kind of? You don't know where you live? - Well, I know where I live but I'm not so certain that a complete stranger should know where I live. - I thought we weren't strangers anymore? - Oh, yeah, good point (laughs). - You did the whole, "I'm Marissa," thing. (Marissa laughs) Well, if you enjoy this, I have to ask, do you wanna get a coffee sometime or? - Yeah. I'd like that. - I know that there's a place up the street. - There is. They have good coffee. And even better croissants. (Andrew chuckles) (Marissa chuckles) (shop bell chimes) (mellow music) (gentle music) - Hey, you got some papers to file or somethin'? Come on. You're a photographer, right? - Yes, I'm a photographer. - How long you been doin' that for? - (sighs) I don't know, like six, seven years. - Okay, good. Listen, a girl just got murdered. Some psycho got a hold of her and turned her into a fuckin' Picasso painting. Man, there's shit all over the street and I wanna be first on this, okay? So, get down there, take some pictures. I have a guy who knows you're comin'. His name's Detective Beli, talk to him. - What do you want me to do? Like... - Your a photographer, man. Take some fuckin' pictures and don't forget your press pass. (mellow music) (Andrew sighs) (engine rumbling) (mellow music) (windshield wipers whirring) (rain pattering) (birds chirping) (water splashing) (pensive music) (crows cawing) (shutter clicking) (pensive music) - Horton? - [Horton] Yeah? - Can you contact the medical examiner? We need an ETA. We got media showin' up. You need to get this body processed and outta here. - [Horton] Absolutely, Chief. (eerie music) (shutter clicking) (eerie music) (pensive music) - Tire tracks, guys. There's a pair of 'em right there. Watch your step. (Ray speaking faintly) (eerie music) (pensive music) (shutter clicking) Beli, who the hell is that? - Some kid from the "Journal." Just here to take pictures. - Oh, that's really sweet. Are you fuckin' shittin' me? We can't have one case in this little town without a reporter stickin' his nose in it? - It wasn't my call. I just found out a few minutes ago myself. Fuckin' Toner. - [Ray] Who? - Toner. - [Ray] Toner? Who the hell let him in on this? - The Chief. - Ah, jeez. So he caved, right? That's, that's, that's great. It's a murder investigation. It's not a damn circus. (pensive music) (match strikes) (pensive music) (water splashing) (pensive music) (keys jingling) (Andrew's throat clears) (engine rumbling) (pensive music) (car beeping) (pensive music) (mellow music) (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) (mellow music) - So, as I promised to bring you an example of art in everyday life, Andrew here, who once upon a time was one of you consented to come and give us an example of his knowledge on SLRs. So, please welcome Andrew Kaleen. (students applauding) (mellow music) (Andrew's throat clears) - Thank you, Professor. So today, like he said, we're gonna be talking, actually, can I get everyone up to the front? Pretty intimate group today. So, the slow death of art begins. (Andrew's throat clearing) (mellow music) So, today we're gonna be talking about SLRs. Does anyone know what SLR stands for, just off the top of your head? Okay, it stands for a single lens reflex (throat clears). And what that means is that the photographer sees exactly what is exposed to the film at the moment he actually presses down on the shutter. That's the basic, basic definition of it. After that you can adjust it manually based on the single lens reflex that's provided by the camera itself, so. Now, onto the lens, I mean, how would you take a picture without the lens? More specifically (throat clears), the lens acts as a bent glass. So, whatever you're taking a picture of actually converges at the same time that the light passes through, thus far I'm giving you your image. And on the focus of the camera... I have one. Yeah, what's up? - [Man] How does the camera actually capture the image? - Okay, yeah. Fair question. Definitely. Does anyone actually know the answer to that one? - When light passes through the shutter, it flips. - So there's mirrors within the camera. You got a top mirror and a bottom mirror. Basically they work together but they both do different things. Get rid of the top mirror for a second. Let me give you an example. Let's say you were taking a picture without the top mirror. So, you got your aunt, your uncle, your grandpa, your lover, whatever you have in the frame. When you snap the picture, if it just passes through the lens and doesn't hit the top mirror, you're shown a distorted image, essentially the wrong image, a false perception of reality. (pensive music) - Andrew? Hey. How are you? - I'm good. - Good, Jill. Jill, from work. - Oh, right. I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you because of your... - Yeah, I have my hair down. It's a little flare I'm trying to add. - It looks nice. - Thanks. Interesting, right? How one feature can make one totally forget what another one looks like. Have you given into the digital title wave at all or are you still clinging on to film? - No, I prefer film but at work they prefer digital, so. - Yeah, yeah. Well, it was nice seeing you. - Good seeing you, too. - I have to go, but if I leave, you're not gonna forget me again are you? - No, of course not. - (chuckles) Great. Well, have a great day. - All right, you too. - Thank you. (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (pensive music) (brakes squealing) (pensive music) (door slams) (door creaking) (pensive music) (lock clicks) (fridge door unlatches) (bottles clinking) (Andrew slurping) (pensive music) (package rustling) (pensive music) (film thuds) (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (crickets chirping) (engine rumbling) (crickets chirping) (pensive music) (crickets chirping) (shutter clicking) (pensive music) (siren wailing) (water splashing) (engine rumbling) (pensive music) - What's up, man? Hey, what's been up with you lately? Like, you take a couple pictures and now you're a hermit. - Oh, I don't wanna talk about it. - Well, maybe you could talk about it at the bar tonight. It's gonna be fun, man. - I don't wanna talk about it. - [Ryan] Please? - No. - [Ryan] John's gonna be there. Pat's gonna be there. - No. - Hey Kaleen, come here. I need to talk to you for a minute. - [Ryan] So, what about the bar? - I don't know, I'll text you. - You took those pictures of that girl. Did Robin have you do it? Listen, Andrew, I like you a lot. You take great pictures. I've been doin' this for years and this is not a major metropolitan daily. Small town, small stories. But this, this is a big story. And I saw those pictures that you took and they made me sick. Honestly, if Robin had it his way this would be his paper, but he's on thin ice as it is and I don't need a good kid like you goin' out and doin' that for him. When I picked you up, you were like what, 20, 21? You were fresh and sincere and the people in this town need that in their lives. So, do it for them and do it for me, okay? (door creaking) (phone ringing) (door latches) (phone ringing) (officers chattering) - No she wasn't? - No, no, she wasn't raped and that's what's weird about this. And that's just it. If it was, it was somethin' like that, this would make sense but it doesn't. It's like we missed somethin'. - That's it? - [Beli] That's it. - That's what we got? He's tryin' to send us a message. We got nothin'? - [Beli] I think we need to revisit the crime scenes. - We're not gonna revisit the crime, we're not gonna find anything new by doin' that, come on. You know what? Why don't you take a break? - Yeah. - We're both overloaded. You just... - Yeah, okay. Wanna go grab lunch? - No, no thanks. My wife packed me some. - Let me know if you find somethin'? - Yeah, I will. I'm gonna stay here. I need to look into it. - Okay. (door creaking) (officers chattering) - Hi. How can I help you? - I'm looking for Detective Beli. - [Receptionist] And your name? - Andrew. - [Receptionist] One moment. I'll call him. He'll be back. (buttons beeping) (line trilling) (patrons chattering) (cutlery clinking) - So, I was wondering if there's anything you can tell me? - About? - The girls. - You know I can't talk about this stuff. It's confidential. - Oh, is there- - Oh. Thanks, Tracy. (patrons chattering) Sure you don't want anything? - I'm fine. (patrons chattering) - Maybe I got a call last night, maybe I didn't. Fuck you. - I mean like, is there anything you can tell me considering I was like, like a part of it? (pensive music) You might be able to help me with somethin'. - Okay. - Well, you're a photographer. Familiar with cameras, right? - Mm hm. - Okay, well, we found a frame counter. (Andrew's throat clears) - A frame counter from like a really old 35 millimeter? - Sure. Any reason someone would leave that lyin' around? - No. Uh uh, no. You'd have to take it out. I mean, you'd have to actually physically take it out of the camera. - So, it'd be on purpose? - Yes, it'd be intentional. - Is there are any reason somebody would mark everything except the number five? - Mark everything except the number five? - Yeah, on the frame counter. - Not sure, no. (pensive music) (phone ringing) - Hold that thought. (phone beeps) (pensive music) Do you want me to come down there and hold your hand? No, I already told you who we should be lookin' for. You know, no. I'll be there in 10. Yeah. All right. - Have to go? Okay. - So, this has been fun. I appreciate the information. You askin' all these questions, it's kind of annoying but also a little suspicious. - Suspicious, okay. (pensive music) - Let me be the detective and let me solve this. - Okay. - Enjoy the fries. (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (man thuds) - [Andrew] What the fuck? (pensive music) (lighter flicks) (pensive music) (paper rustling) (pensive music) (thunder rumbling) (pensive music) - Hello? - [Andrew] I was the one who called earlier. - So, you're here for the Burndry pieces? Okay. Let me look real quick. (eerie music) Looks like we have it in the back corner. That'll be right this way. (eerie music) So, what was this for again? - [Andrew] I'm a photographer from the paper. (eerie music) - [Gallery Owner] These are the paintings you're looking for. - [Andrew] So, how long have these been up? - [Gallery Owner] They've been up for three weeks now. So, I need to finish closing now. If there's anything else you need from me, let me know. - Thank you. - I'll be back. (pensive music) (eerie music) (leaves rustling) (pensive music) (shutter clicking) (pensive music) (lighter flicks) (pensive music) (patrons chattering) - So, ask me about my day. - Yeah, yeah. How was your day? - Well, some of the kids were sick at school which was kind of annoying but it's, it's what I do. - Yeah, I don't know how you do it. - Do what? Be a pre-school teacher? - No, just be on all the time. I mean, I get onto one thing and I don't know, I just get really distracted, so. - I don't know, it's just kinda my personality. - Yeah. Well, what were your parents like? - Loud (chuckles). My mom passed away as you know. - Go ahead, scream, scream! (woman whimpering) (woman screaming) Scream! (woman screams) No on can hear! Nobody can! - I really think he would love you. - Would you excuse me for a second? - [Marissa] Yeah. - All right, I'll be right back. (door latches) (mellow music) (Andrew's throat clears) Come on, come on, pick up, pick up, pick up. (Andrew exhales) (mellow music) Hey Detective, Beli. It's Andrew. I found out something about the case and I just need to talk to you, it's really urgent. So, please call me back if you can. Just call me back. (mellow music) Hey, is there a way we can maybe reschedule this at another time? I'm so sorry I'm having to do this right now. - What happened? What's wrong? - Nothing, I'm fine. There's just something I have to go do. Please understand. Trust me, okay? You look beautiful. (rock music) (gentle music) (pensive music) Fuck! (hands thudding) (pensive music) (birds chirping) (pensive music) (eerie music) (wood thuds) (wire whizzing) (woman screams) - No! (liquid splashing) (eerie music) - I'm sorry! (Andrew screams) (eerie music) (machinery whirring) (pensive music) - Dude, where the hell have you been? - I've been busy, I'm sorry. - Busy with what? - Dude, just stuff, why? This about Hollinger? - Did you talk to Hollinger yet? - I talked to him, it was like two weeks ago. He talked to me about how the photos were too graphic for the papers. - Well, they found her. - What? - [Ryan] Jill. - Jill, they found. I didn't even know that she was gone. - Of course you didn't. You never really seemed to notice her but she always noticed you. - I'm sorry, is this the department or what the fuck- - She's fuckin' dead. Yeah. She's been dead for awhile. Hollinger's been keepin' it like low key, but yeah, she's fuckin' dead. - Well, where was that at? - It's like a orchard. I think they said an orchard north from here. Are you gonna have like some sort of reaction to this? Like, you just had a coworker fuckin' die, so uh... - I'm sorry, I just don't know what to say. - You're kinda freakin' some people out. - Yeah, like who? - Me for one, I don't know. Marissa, maybe. - What's she have to do with this? When did you even get time to talk to her? - She's just concerned, man. - Okay, fuck this, dude. I don't have time for it and I'm gonna go. We'll talk later. (solemn music) (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (mellow music) (TV chattering) (mellow music) (Andrew knocking) (pensive music) (fist thuds) (Mitchell groans) (dramatic music) - Where's your fuckin' tape? - Huh? - I said where's your fuckin' tape? - [Mitchell] What the fuck you want- - Where's your fuckin' tape so I can bound your hands together? - Top shelf by the microwave. (pensive music) (Mitchell groaning) - Get the fuck up. (Mitchell groaning) (pensive music) Show me your fuckin' hands, Mitchell, come on. (Andrew panting) (pensive music) You know why I'm fuckin' here, huh? - I don't know. You break into my fuckin' house. (pensive music) - Do you know why I'm here, Mitchell? - [Mitchell] No, I don't know why you're here. Bust into my house, fuckin' piece of shit. - You see these? See these fuckin' pictures? What the fuck are they? - I've never seen anything like that in my fuckin' life! - Shut up. I see two dead girls in a pool of blood dressed up like you're fuckin' babies. You fuckin' did this! - I didn't do that, man! What the fuck? (glass shatters) God! Fuck! (pensive music) - I need you to use your fuckin' brain, okay? - You think I did that? You got some sort of a fuckin' copycat or somethin', man. - [Andrew] Mitchell, if you didn't do it then who did? - I don't know, man, I don't know. - Fuck, Mitchell. (fist thuds) (Mitchell groans) (pensive music) - Fuck! - Fucking think! - Okay. I, there was this asshole who was followin' me around. Just an arrogant little prick, thinks he's better than me or somethin' like that. He was showin' me these rip offs he did of my work. That's all I can think of. - Who the fuck was it? - I don't know what the fuck his name was! Just a young guy about your age, man. - Okay, okay, shut up, shut up. Okay, this is what I'm gonna do Mitchell. Listen, look at me. All right, this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take your picture, and if I found out your lyin' to me, I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna take your picture again and I swear to God it's not gonna look as good as those, and Mitchell, don't even try to fuckin' call the cops, do you understand me? Do you understand? (pensive music) (Andrew sighs) (pensive music) Smile for the fuckin' camera. - [Mitchell] Fuck you. - All right, great. (dramatic music) (door latches) (crickets chirping) (lock screen clicks) (keyboard keys clacking) (pensive music) Ryan (throat clears), Ryan, who was she? - [Ryan] I don't know, I turned those off. Who? - No, the girl with the bar, man. Who was she? - [Ryan] Yeah, I don't know. I think we went to school with her and stuff and she went to other classes, I don't know. - No, I mean- - What? - I mean like, who was she with? Where was she going? - [Ryan] Whoa, man, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just calm yourself down for a second. Just don't worry yourself over this. This was a long time ago, okay? Look, where are you at right now? Andrew? Andrew? (pensive music) (keypad beeps) (door buzzing) (pensive music) (machinery whirring) - What are you doin' here so late? - I'm just checking on, I'm checking on something for Robin. The archive room. I have to like, uh... It will just take me a second. It'll just be a second, really. - Okay, okay. The archive room is down the hall next to the yellow room. - The yellow room, okay. - Yeah. - Thank you. - All right. (machinery whirring) (pensive music) (papers rustling) (pensive music) - I had this friend. He was 17. I knew him from high school. We were pretty good friends, enough that he let me into places others didn't. There weren't a lotta times we hung out, but he always made me feel important, which to this day I still never knew why. Eventually, his girlfriend stopped caring. His parents stopped caring, too. It was like, all of a sudden the love fell from his life. He buried himself in school and he was so far away from it all. It was dreadful. It created this overwhelming sadness around me. I couldn't imagine one person's life changing so fast. And then he left me a note. Out of nowhere he left me a note. I'm out in the woods. We had this spot. So, I jumped in my car. Nothin' felt right. It's almost as if I knew what he meant and where he was. I knew exactly how he felt. Months of anguish and sorrow. I finally knew how he felt. I pulled up to a narrow opening in the woods. I saw him, so I got out of my car. In the moment, I had a chance to say one thing to him, anything, and there he was. Then he was gone. (shot firing) (pensive music) (liquid sloshing) (pensive music) (gentle music) (keys jingling) (bicycle wheels ticking) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (door creaking) (gentle music) Mrs. Donelly? I had a few questions about your daughter, Shelby. Can I come in? - [Mrs. Donelly] Who are you? - My name is- - What, what is this for? - My name is Andrew Kaleen. I work for the "Southern Oregon Journal." It'll only take a minute. (gentle music) You have a very lovely home. Mrs. Donelly, I've been looking into the recent killings in the area and I have reason to believe that your daughter might be related. Do know who Mitchell Burndry is? (gentle music) He's a local artist. I wouldn't have made the connection but then I saw this. - Wait a minute. I thought you said you were with the paper? - No, no, I am, I am. I'll show you my, my card. (gentle music) All right. Here's the thing, though. I'm really close, all right? Anything I find, the information, it's not going to the front page. It's going straight to the police. (Mrs. Donelly sighs) So, I don't want you- (door unlatching) (pensive music) - Who are you? - I'm Andrew Kaleen. I'm from the "Southern Oregon Journal." - Are you okay, hon? - I was just asking your wife some questions about your daughter. - Are you a detective? - No, no, I'm not a detective. I work for the "Southern Oregon Journal." - I think you better leave. - All right. Thank you for your time, Ma'am. (gentle music) (lighter flicking) (gentle music) - Julian Lotun. Shelby dated him a couple of times and I told the police about him and they didn't do a thing. Had this strange air about him. Since Shelby died, I haven't heard his name again. (gentle music) - So, the serial killer is mimicking artwork. This is "The Third Scar" by Mitchell Burndry. Notice how it's very similar to the cuts on the victim up here. We've got gold lines comin' off kinda like the blood flow in that pattern. You with me so far? - You're really, you're really pushin' it, Beli. - Okay, well hear me out. It gets better. So, here we have "The Black Wig," also by Mitchell Burndry. Now, granted he takes a few more liberties turning the victim into a tree, but you can definitely see this isn't a coincidence. - So, what are you tellin' me? You're takin' advanced art classes at night? This is what you got to give me here? - No, no, not quite. I know what you're gonna say. - [Ray] No you don't. - But our friend from the "Journal," he kinda led me to this. - That guy bugs you. What the fuck does he have to do with this, huh? - I'm not sure yet but I don't think we need to be turnin' this into a fuckin' witch hunt. Okay? - I could safely assume you checked out this Burndry character, right? - [Beli] I did. - What? - And his alibi does check out. He was up in Canada. He's been up there the last two and a half weeks in an art exhibit. I verified he was there. Flights, all that does check out. - You didn't just take his word for it, right? - No. - You checked it out? - No. He got back into town just in the last couple days. He had no fucking clue about these murders. - All right, listen up. Second murder scene, right? We already talked about art and the murders, right? You're just... But we find that frame counter and what do we find? Two shot, four are left, right? Is this guy tryin' to tell us he's gonna try to do this four more times? And if that's the case and if you're right about this art connection, where do we find those four painters? What's that? - Maybe we need to do some digging. Art exhibit downtown, Mitchell Burndry. (pensive music) - Okay. Let's do it. (pensive music) (mysterious music) - [Julian] Can I help you? - Are you Julian Lotun? - [Julian] Andrew? - Yeah. - [Julian] Why don't you come on in and take a seat. (piano music) The last time I saw you was, what was that? Like, two, three years ago? - Yeah, something like that. (water splashing) (piano music) - [Julian] You want something to drink? - No, I'm not thirsty. (piano music) (tea splashing) (piano music) - So, what's this about? - Do you remember, Shelby Donelly? - Shelby Donelly? No, no, that doesn't sound familiar. You know what? Actually, yeah, yeah, I do. I do. - Well, you dated her, right? - Sure, yeah. She was murdered, right? That was the whole thing? - Yeah. - I'm sorry, it's just her and I were lovers of sorts. So, it just is kind of a tough emotional burden for me to bear, you understand? I tend to try to forget it. You mind if I ask you a question, Andrew? - Yeah, go ahead. (eerie music) - What do you do, like, for a living? - I'm a photographer. I take picture for the "Journal." - And does that thrill you? - I'd rather be taking pictures of something else, but I mean, it's not bad. I mean, it's not exciting if that's what you're asking. - And why are you asking about Shelby, Detective? (eerie music) Well, serial killers, it's exciting stuff, I gotta say. - Sick fuck. - And is he, though? I mean, I feel like maybe he's got somethin' pretty beautiful in the works. If you think about it. Let me explain it to you. See, you have an artist and a serial killer. What's the difference? I mean, one might attract more attention than the other, but hey, you remember Conceptual Art Design and their Modern Methods, right? And as Professor Penn so mildly put it it's all subjective, and see, subjectivity sure is strange. One could even debate the subjectivity of subjectiveness, thus furthering my point and see, how can you say that something's wrong if it thinks it's always right? - And killing people's an art or some sort of talent? - And your lackluster approach as a detective is a talent? Let's not forget that all these victims, they had flaws. Maybe they, maybe they wanted to change, but they didn't and that's the whole point. And maybe they were more monstrous than the monster. Did you ever think about that? - You are the judger of morals? (gentle music) - No. No, just an opinion, Andrew. (gentle music) You don't look too good. I mean, you look like you haven't slept in weeks. You're just knockin' on stranger's doors, askin' all these questions and I mean, you've seen that people are scared of this guy, right? You should be careful. - Are those yours? (glass clinking) You take photos? - One could say that. - You know, I'm gonna find out who's doing this. - I hope you do. (eerie music) - Tell me everything you know about Shelby Donelly. - You know, I've got a red light room in the back. (eerie music) - On second thought maybe I should just go. (eerie music) Thank you for the tea. (eerie music) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (keypad beeping) (gentle music) - Yeah, Beli. Hey, remember that address I was checkin' up on? Last Lotun? Lincoln, ocean, Tom, union, Nora. Yeah. Yeah, can you get that for me again? (gentle music) (birds chirping) All right. Can you show me in route to that location? No. No, I don't need backup. I'll be fine. All right. Thanks. Damn it. (gentle music) (keys jingling) (engine rumbling) (pensive music) Beli. What? What the fuck you mean he's there? Yeah. All right. I'll be there in a minute. (crickets chirping) You a fan of Burndry? (police scanner chattering) - His colors of red and all that's just quite delicate. I have to say, he's fantastic. Are you a fan of art? - I am but none of this new age shit. In fact, Burndry, his art, to me it's a little messy. Why are you here? - [Julian] Well, it seems that people are really enjoying my art. - And What art are you referring to? - Well, my art that is, I mean, that sounds a little pretentious, but you know, all of us are. How do you feel about forgers? - [Beli] I think they're full of shit. - Hm. See, I disagree. You see, forgers are what make the world go 'round. It's all just recycling these days anyways. Sometimes you have to learn from the greats to be a great. - [Beli] What the fuck are you talking about? - [Julian] Well, I'm sure that you saw my, my paintings in my house. Those copies of Burndry's artwork. Yeah, you see, soon I'll have my own, my own of complete originality. Masterpiece, if you will. You should really check it out. I mean, it's fantastic. Once it's all finished. I mean, if you guys are into that kinda thing. - You wouldn't happen to own any cameras, would you? - Yes. You know, but really I should be going, so. - Well, before you do, you wouldn't mind if we got some fingerprints while you're here? - No. I'll give you all five. (table creaking) (pensive music) (yelling indistinctly) - Daniels, relax. Hey, relax. - I got you? - Have a good day, Detectives. - I got you fuckin' piss head! - Yeah, I'm sure you do. - Get a search warrant. Get a fuckin' search warrant! - Already done. It's already done. (crickets chirping) (pensive music) Andrew, it's Beli. (Beli sighs) You were right about Julian. I really need you to call me back. Call me when you get this, all right? Hey Horton, how many is that? - We got five. (pensive music) (crickets chirping) (man thuds) (blood splattering) (pensive music) (tires screeching) (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (pensive music) (crickets chirping) (pensive music) (foot thudding) (pensive music) (iron thuds) (pensive music) (foot thudding) (pensive music) (solemn music) (crickets chirping) (engine rumbling) (pensive music) (door creaking) (pensive music) (Andrew inhales) (door creaking) (pensive music) (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) (door unlatching) (gun cocks) (shot firing) (solemn music) - No! Oh, God, no (sobs)! (eerie music) - See, you and I, we're the same. We wanted to put new money into art, into the world. - What the fuck are you talking about? - You remember back in college? - No. - You remember Mitchell Burndry, right? You see, we wanted to put new meaning into it, make it new again. We created it. That night, we did what we both desired. We watched beautiful killing transpire. (eerie music) We struck a stroke of genius as we gutted her in the street. You remember that? (solemn music) - I wanted redemption. I wanted to change them. - The ones who you neglected? - They were so sad. - [Julian] They were so sad. - I wanted to kill 'em. (solemn music) - [Julian] Will you remember this? (solemn music) You remember this? (solemn music) We took what was pitiful and made it beautiful. We both know you wanted to create again. (solemn music) (gun cocking) I miss saving the world, Andrew. (solemn music) (gun cocking) - I choose to forget. (shots firing) (pensive music) (door latches) (solemn music) (door unlatches) (solemn music) (shutter clicking) (solemn music) (door latches) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (Andrew sniffing) (gentle music) (glasses clinking) (gentle music) (Andrew exhales) (engine rumbling) (mellow music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (lighter flicks) (frogs croaking) (solemn music) - [Julian] I don't want you to kill him. - You said you were fuckin' gonna do that! - I'm not gonna... - You know beasts kill each other. - [Julian] In his fuckin' throat. - You want me to slit his fuckin' throat? - Yeah. Take the fucking knife. - You take the fucking- - Take the knife! (Andrew yells) - Evolution, survival. Calm yourself down. - Stop! - All right, shut up! - Come on! - All right, move your fuckin' hand. - Slit his throat and do it! - I don't wanna fuckin' cut you. - Please! - Quick! (solemn music) - We the human race, we can appreciate art. (Andrew gasps) Yes! This is what I'm talking about! - Okay, okay. - This is what I'm talking about you- - Okay. - We can appreciate art, you understand? So, in this world, this dimension? (solemn music) Killing is all right. And you'll feel good about it, trust me! - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, fuck. - Yeah, build yourself up, man. - I got it! I fuckin' murdered you, you fucker! (crickets chirping) (solemn music) - Damn anyone who tells us otherwise. (crickets chirping) (pensive music) (Andrew coughs) (pensive music) (birds chirping) (mellow music)
