Hello? JP? Vivian? I don't like people photographing my family. I'm afraid I'm going to have to confiscate that camera... and then strangle you to death. JP. Francis. JP. Francis. JP. Francis. JP. Francis. You look exactly the same. Only you look like you're going on a safari. I feel like I'm going on a safari. Well, the animals here tend to stay in their dens. This really is quite a place, JP. Oh, gosh, you don't know the half of it. It's very much like you've entered a dream, for better or worse. It was my grandma's on the Luret side originally, Dad's mom. Her paintings are all over. - You told me on the phone. - I'm sure I did. I've been having a problem with my short-term memory. Is that part of your condition? It's strange, you know, I can remember all these things from way back, only sometimes I don't know if I'm remembering something that actually happened or remembering a dream. Oh, gosh. What's the matter? Would you mind taking your shoes off before we go any further? Oh geez, I'm sorry. It's perfectly alright, really. I don't think I tracked anything in. I wouldn't care if you did. Oh. Uh, where should I put them? - Not bad. Tell you the truth, I always get a bit anxious when people have their shoes on in the house. It always feels like they're about to leave. And you just got here. Lot of shoes in there. The shoe cave. Now I just need to spin around ten times so that the world doesn't end in flames. I can't believe it's been ten years. Mm, my father's memorial. Sorry I didn't keep in touch. My fault as much as yours. It's funny, I hope this doesn't sound too strange, but... you're in my dreams quite a lot. You're in my dreams, too. Usually, it's you and me and Vivian... in some house somewhere. Well, here we are. What made you decide to call? Believe it or not, I suddenly remembered watching a war movie with you. - Which one? - I can't remember, but there was a young man dying in another man's arms, and there was that feeling of brotherhood that I've never completely understood but have always been very moved by. Anyway, I realized I no longer had that in my life, and I wanted to cry. What made you say yes? Well, gosh, when you said you needed help, it was hard to say no. It means a lot to hear you say that. You caught me at a good time. Anyway, I was excited to reconnect. Me too. It's just me and Vivian now, you know. That's it. That's the Luret family. Where is Vivian? She might be worse off than I am. Is Vivian sick, too? She hasn't been right since Dad died. And if she's down, I'm down. That's how twins work, you know? - Are you gonna be alright? - Tell you truth... I've never been able to half-way imagine myself in my old age. Depression's always been the family evil. All the money you could need and no peace at all. Now, Viv and I aren't connecting like we used to. I think she's tired of me. Maybe I squeeze too tight. Anyway, now I have you to connect with. I'm all yours. Although it wouldn't be a very satisfying safari without a Vivian sighting. Yeah, well. Incidentally, I wouldn't get too close to her room, unless you want to get clawed to death. That dangerous, huh? No, I mean it. Don't bother her. I should see if she wants some coffee. Listen, I was thinking of making brats and spaetzle tonight. I thought you were going to say that. Or, well, I hoped you were going to say that. I'll run out, and get what we need. No, there's no need. I have everything. I had it delivered. You can have practically anything delivered here. We never have to leave this place. - It's me. - Vivian! Do not behave this way. You can live with that on the floor. That was grandma's French porcelain, you bitch! I want to know how things are really going. Not good. - Money troubles? - Oh, sure. Are you homeless? Not exactly. Where are you keeping your belongings? - In a storage unit in Burbank. - Burbank? You've not had the same lap to fall into as I have. I forget that. Listen, you've got to promise not judge me too harshly when I tell you this, but I haven't stepped foot outside this place in two years. Two years? Well, it's a nasty world, you know? I mean, it's beautiful for sure, but it's too nasty. Just the other morning, I read that a man walked into a caf√© and started killing people with a hammer, at random. It's senseless out there, and I don't want to be part of it. You sound like a 100-year-old man. I am an old man in many ways. I've figured out what I want with my time, and it's being here. When I walk in this garden, I feel like a boy again, and I remember the smell of things. And it's even stronger with you around. I really hope you stay for a while. Viv? Get out of here, or you'll die with the rest of us. I shuffle a deck when I'm restless. I just saw Vivian. Viv? Like a log. I'm not crazy. She does sleepwalk. - That must have been it. - Yeah, or, you know, maybe you were sort of dreaming yourself. Come on, JP. Are you awake right now? Yeah, of course I'm awake. Look, she was dripping wet. Francis, you've had an accident. This is you. Are you sure you're awake right now? I think so. Hmm. I'll be interested to see if you remember this in the morning. It's some sort of litany. It's beautiful, isn't it? I don't even know what she's saying. Is that for me? I was going to make something more elaborate, then I remembered you like nothing more in the world than buttered toast. - Mm! - If that's still true. Yes, it is. I've got good news. They can bring your stuff here from Burbank. We'll just throw it in the workshop. How is that? They're bringing my stuff here? It's already taken care of. Well... gosh, I don't mean to be confrontational, but I wish you'd have brought it up with me first. Yeah, but then it wouldn't be a surprise, and now you can just pocket that monthly fee. - How'd you sleep? - Not that well. Did you talk to Viv? About what? About last night. What about last night? - Coming in here. - Who? We talked about it in the kitchen. I don't remember that. Are you sure it wasn't a dream? What are you looking for? I started a load this morning. You did laundry this morning? You're saying Vivian came in here? We talked about it. - I wet myself. - Wet yourself? Be straight with me, JP. I'll be completely straight with you, and this is something you'll just have to lean into. This house is, you know, a beautiful place, but it's a strange place. What can I say, the imagination is one of its oldest allies. What are you doing with those sleeping bags? I found these when I was clearing out the workshop this morning, and thought... for old time's sake, we might... Oh no, JP, I think we're too old for that. Please? Please? Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please. - It's a bit rough for me, JP. - I'm sorry, Francis. I was just playing. I haven't played with anyone in a while. I'm gonna go take a shower. Breathe. Can you still say your presidents? George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe. John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, William Henry Harrison. Your heart is good. Blood pressure's good. I might start you on the inhaler again. Are you drinking plenty of water? No. I've known Jean Paul since he was seven pounds, and even as a baby he was melancholic. What exactly is wrong with him? Francis, you know, sometimes a sickness of the soul can will the body to suffer likewise. That being said, it could be a number of things. He shouldn't exert himself so much. At least not so dynamically. I recommend stretching. Stretching? Make sure he's hydrated, that he doesn't drink too much alcohol. And talk to him. Keep him company. What he needs right now is a companion, a friend. 'I saw what you did, kid, it was great. 'I'm proud of you, Frankie.' 'Thanks Lieutenant.' 'All right, keep it there. You'll be alright then.' Isn't this wonderful, getting to spend all this time together? Francis? It is. It's quiet. Very quiet. You know, my grandmother drank herself to death in this room. Did I ever tell you that? Every once in a while when it's quiet... you can hear her sigh. Francis. I had a terrible dream. May I sit? OK. There was a creature in the dream. A sort of man, but something was wrong with his face. And he'd wrapped it in a shirt or something. I knew that underneath was the face of a dog and the face of a pig. And everywhere he went, he crawled, and he wore a leather jacket and jeans. In the dream, I knew his name was The Bloodhound. And I knew he got around by using the rivers and sewers. He'd crawl into a house and hide in the closet. And the house would give him power, and he'd fill everyone with fear. And they'd be afraid until there was a tenderness between the people in the house. A real tenderness. An apology. Forgiveness. The real deal sort of thing. And then he'd move down the river and find a new house. It was just a bad dream. Can I stay in here? Stay in here? I'm still a little spooked. Well, I know it wasn't me, because I'm still hungry. I'd never treat a brat that way. That leaves Vivian. I don't want to act like a crazy person, but what the fuck are you doing? Dishes. I thought I told you to leave Vivian alone. She's in the shower. I thought I'd see if there were any plates. You don't need to go into her room, definitely not. There's a bowl of vomit on the floor in there. Goddammit, Francis. Why can't you mind your own fucking business? - I don't think she's well, JP. - She's not, for Christ's sake. She's out of her bird. And that doesn't concern you? Are you kidding me? All I do is try to help her. And you can help by leaving her alone and following the house rules. Yeah, keep my shoes in the cave and only go into the rooms you say I can go into. You're a guest, aren't you? I don't see what's so unreasonable about that. You're not supposed to listen to Mozart to feel bad about yourself. You listen to Mozart to stir the wonder. I know Natasha isn't, you know, a world class soprano... but she can still light the fire, stir the wonder a little. I guess it wasn't exactly the kind of connectivity and shared experience I was hoping for. Don't you think it'd be interesting to go down the hill to a bar or something? I'd rather walk along the beach until I died. I know what to do. I wanna show you something. I don't get it, JP, it's a porno. Call it what you want. Feels a heck of a lot like a porno. Recognize the couch? Good god, JP, did you make this? Who are these women? Friends. Well, expensive friends. This is very hardcore, JP. I've suddenly remembered something. We watched a porno when we were... God, we must have been 12. I don't remember that. We were in my room, in the dark. You were behind me. It was a fairy tale porno. Alice as sodomized by a cat-man! Does it make you uncomfortable when I touch your leg? What about up here? Relax Francis. Or here? Holy cow, Francis! We were just playing around. - We're drinking! - I'm going to bed. We're drinking, we're nightclubbing! - You should have some water. - Fuck your water, Francis, OK? - Fuck it! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you're right, can I have some water? - Hi. - That was 45 minutes. Uh, no, that was 35. No, 45, which means we don't pay you, and you can fuck off back down the driveway. - JP, just... - I was 35. - This man's a lunatic, Francis. - I am not, you are. I'm gonna kill you! Developments in neuroscience have suggested that entering a new space or crossing a threshold can cause one to forget whatever it was they were entering to do. Did you use all the cash? Francis? He went for a grand. He deserved none of it. That's a lot of cash to have on hand. Yeah, well, you gotta have pizza money. Are you alright? Ah, it feels like my head is being squeezed by some demon. I'll get you some aspirin. What was I doing? Francis, I'm gonna have a nap. Someone crawled around while we were sleeping and robbed us. My cameras are gone. And someone got into the pizza money. Pizza money? Was there a lot? There was a lot of pizza money, as a matter of fact. What a shit show! Do you want to call the cops? Just let me know what you're missing. We'll take care of it. You're not responsible, JP. It's nothing for me to replace your cameras, you know that. Whatever you say. I just wish we could have caught him. I wouldn't want to kill him. I just want him to feel fear. Do you want me to call Dr. Ricky? I want you to call the bakery. Edmond's. I want a chocolate cake with butter cream frosting. And let's clean this up. I don't want Vivian to see what's happened. What's the cake for? Vivian's birthday. Oh, shit. October 26th. I forgot, I'm sorry. Happy birthday. I don't care about birthdays, but I care about Vivian. Chocolate cake with butter cream frosting. - Sure. - What did I say? Chocolate cake with butter cream frosting. She goes nuts for it. What do you want for dinner? Brats. You look anxious. I had a bad dream last night. You really want to get out of here, don't you? Why do you say that, JP? Trapped in this house, and we're not even safe anymore. You can't make peace anywhere. Someone always fucks it up. Are you going to leave me, Francis? I'm not going anywhere, JP. It's your birthday. What about champagne? Do you want champagne? Where can I find some? There are bottles in the vault. I'd go down myself, but... I'm afraid to go down there. JP. JP? - Can you hear me? JP? 'Hello?' JP, the vault door has closed. 'Oh, no.' Can you help me out? You don't like it down there? No. 'Oh. 'I guess I ought to let you out.' Thank you. Press zero six times on the call box. I know it's ridiculous, OK? Keeping myself here. To be perfectly honest with you, Francis, I feel like a slave to some sort of... I don't know, irrational fear. What can I say about it? I keep thinking I'll suddenly wake up... floating around in space alone. Spinning forever. Occasionally bumping into someone else who's also floating... but they're always a stranger, and they're never happy to see me. I'm happy to see you, JP. Yeah. I wish that were true of my own sister. She won't even have dinner with us. Every time I try to get close, I make it worse. I don't understand how she can be so cold. I don't want any cake. I have an idea. She's not gonna go for this. She gets sort of unreasonable. Knock, before these things go out. Viv, it's me. I'm with Francis. We have a cake. It's chocolate with butter cream frosting. Francis has lit a number of candles. We thought for your birthday we could all have some cake and champagne. What do you say? These candles are gonna turn into a thin layer of wax... I did warn you. I'll get you a glass. - That's not necessary, JP. - Shut up, Francis. It's my birthday. I'm not blind. I have eyes. More importantly, I have feelings. I know things haven't been going so well around here. My only surviving family member hates me. You and I haven't achieved any sort of connectivity or shared experiences, I know that. Or whatever that means. Anyway, I haven't got long. You don't know that. You don't even know what's wrong with you. I feel it coming. I had a dream last night, too, you know? That Vivian died... and we put her in the vault. And we were sitting on the floor upstairs crying... when suddenly I got this horrible feeling that she wasn't really dead. And so I rushed down... and when I found her, she was standing there. And she came over to me... and she kissed me, and we both fell to the floor. I guess we were both dead. It was so real I can't even tell you. I've seen the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter, and power is on the side of the oppressors and they have no comforter. And I know that the dead who've already died are happier than the living... but better than both is the one who has never been born. JP, where's Vivian? Dead, Francis. Vivian died last night. As far as I'm concerned, she killed herself. - JP. - Tomorrow she'll be cremated. I have permission to keep her here with us until then. In the vault... Just in case. You can't be serious. I'm going to go be alone for a while. What was this, Francis? What was what? How did we get here? You and I? Or people in general? Mm. Well, there was a bang. A bang. Something like that. Planets were formed. Somehow water got into the mix. Then we got some fish. The fish climbed out of the sea. Turned into apes. And then one day, the apes woke up. The apes woke up. They woke up and saw the world, you could say. The apes turned into JP... crying on the floor. I had this thought my whole life that it was all going to mean something. That it was all gonna add up somehow. But I don't know. Does it? Friendship means something, doesn't it? What can I do for you, JP? Will you hold me? I guess I'm scared. OK. I just wanted to give Viv a bracelet that was like the one I lost when we were kids. I took it from her at dad's place in Malibu and lost it in the waves. I was so scared because I realized how big the ocean was. And I thought about all the years it'd be at bottom of the sea. Long after I'm gone. Sorry, JP. I dragged her down with me, squeezed too tight. - JP. - And I've tried to drag you down with me, too. I just wanted to get back to a place where things were... I don't know, Francis. New? Full of mystery. I took the money. I stole the money. I guess I've been scared, too. When I came here, I was only thinking about myself. But when I started thinking about leaving... I realized you're the only real friend I have. I know, Francis. There's nothing that happens in this house that goes unknown. I just needed to hear it from you. That's all I've ever wanted. What is that? JP? JP? You were Mr. Luret's caretaker? I was his friend. Joe. I don't know what this is. It means it's all yours. There's no one else on there. And there's this.
