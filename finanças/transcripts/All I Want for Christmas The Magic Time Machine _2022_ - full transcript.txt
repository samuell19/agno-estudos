THE CHRISTMAS ACADEMY So... There it is. Found you, old friend. Chateau-Santa-Claus-du-Pape 1897. The last bottle. What is this? No... Oh, no! What do you think is up? - I don't know. Maybe the Christmas break is extended until Easter. I can feel it. Vacation, here we come! There he is. I've been your headmaster for many years. Christmas, or the festive season, has always been my focus. Always. But... dear friends. I've come to the conclusion that this has been a mistake. Christmas is not worth celebrating. It is a dark and terrible time. So, as the leader of the academy, I have signed this decree. December, the 12th month of the year, shall be like any other month. Starting from today, Santa Claus hats are prohibited. Use will be punished with a fine or mitigated imprisonment. You can't do this! - Silence! Yes, I can. Christmas is cancelled! - That can't be true. Excuse me! Does this apply to Norway? - Yes. You're all fired. This is absurd. - Fired? He can't just... Silence. You heard the headmaster. Silence! Safe travels. ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS: THE MAGIC TIME MACHINE How can the headmaster cancel Christmas? I'm as shocked as you are, Lucia. But the headmaster decides on these matters. Christmas can't be cancelled just because he gets a stupid idea. Don't think about it. Let the adults handle this. I can't just forget it. It's my future, too. You worry too much, darling. You think you're a big girl now, but you're still a child. I'm not a small child anymore. My opinion counts, too. No more talking. Get dressed. We'll fly in a minute. I'm feeling a bit under the weather. A little kiss? - Yes. Did you notice anything else? His blood pressure is too high and his eyes are dead. Let me have a look. This is bad. Please hand me the memory boards. Thank you. Headmaster. Tell me what you see here. No reaction. Now, look at this. Such a lively little creature. No reaction here either. Let's try this one. Yummy, huh? Ugh. Ugh! Interesting. I think we're on to something here. Bleurgh! Come in. Did you find anything? I've searched the entire school. But I found this one in the cellar. No, no, no! Away with it! For God's sake, remove it! - Remove it. Why can't it just be January? Wait. Hi, Lucia. - Hi. So... How's it hanging? - How's it hanging with you? Hi, Valdemar. - Hi. So... Shouldn't you go inside now? - Yes. Bye. Remember to take off your hat. It's the law. Calm down, I'm taking it off. - You'll get a fine. She's so tiring. Hello, good people! From elves to Christmas girls and Santa Clauses! Circus is in town, but only for tonight. Circus Möbius! Mystery, magic and fun! And last but not least: time travels! Are you visiting Circus Möbius tonight? Come and get an experience for life, for all eternity! Circus Möbius! Ho ho ho Brilliant. Everyone! Ho ho ho - Yes! Again. Ho ho ho Ho, ho, ho! An announcement from The Council of Elders. The crisis meeting concerning the cancelling of Christmas starts now. The meeting is only for adults. Ho, ho, ho. As you heard, I have a meeting now, so you can go play. Yes! Won't you join us in the yard? No. We must find out what's going on. How? You'll see. Come. We're facing an extremely serious phenomenon. The headmaster suffers from a traumaticum obstructicum - - which has been so repressed that it's blocking out everything else. Excuse me... I don't understand a word of this. The headmaster can't relate to reality. He's miserable. But why is he so sad? There must be something terrible in his past. Something so bad that it's all he can think about. Whatever happened has made him fear Christmas and even cancel it. Fear Christmas? Can't you just cure him? Give him some pills or maybe a teddy? Only when we know what happened. The only thing we know... please turn it... is that the memory is triggered by rice pudding. And we believe that this old Santa Claus hat is relevant to the case. But we have no clue how it fits in. Of course, we'll do everything to solve this. But the cure has to come from within himself somehow. Can't we deliver presents anyway? No! According to the academy's statutes of 1521 article 11 - - the headmaster's decisions stand. And he can't be dismissed as we can only get a new headmaster - - when the current headmaster has signed his resignation. The headmaster's condition unfortunately prevents this. What are we to do? - We are trying to find out. We must hope for the headmaster's recovery. Come. Let's find Litteramus. I'm afraid we can't change the past. He's in here. Hello, Litteramus. - We've been looking for you. Why weren't you at the meeting? - Hi, Lucia and Valdemar. Speak to The Council of Elders. The headmaster's new law must go. The law is the law. Only the headmaster can change it. The doctors' say that his illness is caused by his past. It is somehow connected to this. - What is this? Why, it's one of the old Santa Claus hats. And it's woven with Lappish wool - - and dyed with... Is it cherry juice? What is the connection to the headmaster? As far as I remember, he stopped as the Santa Claus... of Denmark in 1897. The headmaster was Santa Claus? - Yes, when he was young. Is that him on the painting? - Yes, that's him. Maybe he experienced something bad when he was Santa Claus. Look in the Christmas annals. - Where are they? It's the big book on my table. - I'll fetch it. This is terrible. Without Christmas, there are no gifts. And without gifts, nobody will believe in us. Then we can close the academy. - Here it is. 84... 94... 24th of December, 1896: "Nothing worth noting. Santa Claus was back at 03.33 a.m." "All presents delivered. Clear skies." "1897: Beautiful evening, minus three degrees Celsius." Wait a minute. The headmaster didn't sign it. There's a note. "The Santa Claus from Denmark signs tomorrow because of stomach trouble." "Went straight to bed." And it says he was back already at 10.19 p.m. You can't deliver all those presents so fast. Perhaps the answer is hidden there. He didn't deliver the presents that night. Something serious happened. We must tell the council. - Adults don't listen to children. It's up to us to fix this. Hi. Are you having a good time? - Yes. How are you, Valdemar? - I'm fine. What do you want? - I want to ask you a small favour. A small favour? Yes, it's because... Do you remember Balthasar? One of the three kings. - No. You know, the one from the Orient. - What about him? We have to go visit the headmaster. Is his condition worse now? - No, he's fit as a fiddle. Was that it? - Yes, or no... I wanted to ask you to look after Elias, Balthasar's little sweet son. Elias! - Yes. You're not serious. He's so annoying. - Lucia, do you mind! You're a big girl now. You can do your share. This morning you said I was a child. Now, I'm a big girl. Make up your mind. What am I? - Come and say hi to them. See? Adults don't listen to children. Come on. Oh, yes. A good idea. Lucia! Oh, my God, you're so big now! Who's this? Is it your boyfriend? - Not at all. No, no, of course it isn't. Of course. Lucia would love to look after Elias. - Of course. We're so happy to hear this. Right, Elias? Elias? - Elias? "Do you also combat thin hair and beard? Get thick Santa Claus hair and a long beard in less than eight weeks." Is this yours? - I haven't seen it before. It's yours. - Elias, you busybody. Say hi to Lucia. - No. Don't tell me what to do. What? I'm so sorry. Elias likes to be in charge. I've got a splendid idea. How about going to the circus? All three of you. - I love the circus! It's a very good idea. Right, Lucia? - Yes. Fantastic. Marvellous. Let me see. This should be enough money. Thank you. - We have to get going now. Enjoy yourselves. Elias? You must comply with what Lucia says. Okay? What did the headmaster experience Christmas Eve, 1897? It must've been bad. - What are you talking about? The headmaster. - He's gone nuts, right? He experienced something bad many years ago. That's why he doesn't like Christmas anymore. How long have you two been dating? - We're not dating. If you keep quiet until we reach the circus, you'll get a soda pop. I'll get soda pop and popcorn. A red soda pop, please. Three tickets. Enjoy the show. - Thanks. Thanks. What's up, you little turd? - No, you are a little turd. Ladies and gentlemen! First, it is my great honour - - to present the fantastic knife thrower Ludmilla Dracul! Honoured guests. Before I begin, - - I need a brave volunteer from the audience. Me! Pick me! There's a lively, young man! - Elias, no. If you move... I can't make any guarantees. A miss! Give him a big applause! What are you thinking? I promised your dad to look after you. Nothing happened. Welcome. Do you have a tiny memory from when you were a toddler? No. - I'm about to change that. Sit down. Now we'll hypnotize you and take a journey into the mind. We will travel in time. Listen to my voice. Only my voice. Yes. We will travel back in your life. Back to the time when you were two years old. Knud, when I snap my fingers, - - you'll open your eyes and you're a tiny little toddler. Three, two, one. Open your eyes. It's my birthday! - Your birthday? Today? Today it's Knud's birthday hooray hooray hooray How old are you, Knud? - I'm two years. Knud... Listen to my voice. Only my voice. There you go. When I snap my fingers, you're back in present time. But you'll still be able to remember all these precious memories. Three, two, one. Welcome back, Knud. Knud, do you remember anything from your childhood? Yes. I actually remember my birthday when I turned two. What on earth is this? I've pooped. - It's only a turd or two, my friend. It's just crap, my friend. We need turds in this world! Give Knud a big applause! Honoured guests. It's now time for the main attraction of the evening. The magic time machine. No one really knows where it comes from. Some say it's Antarctica. Others say it's Atlantis. When you enter the machine, - - you can travel to any time in any country. Time isn't just something that moves forward. Time is more like a wheel. Imagine that this is now. But over here is yesterday. Or maybe over here is in a year. Now we just have to find a volunteer from the audience. You, sweet lady. Will you please come up here? Me? - Yes. And your name is? - Gudrun. Where would you like to travel in the past? I'm very interested in ancient Egypt. - Fascinating choice. Right. We're ready. It's not dangerous. As long as you behave. 1325 BC EGYPT I've noticed we have a brave boy here tonight. It was me! - You. No, Elias. Try to take a look in the machine. - It's empty. Yes. Please sit down. Now, Gudrun is in ancient Egypt, the promised land of the Pharaohs. What she experiences there, we really can't tell. Because five seconds here - - can equal many years in the time she travels in. Now, let's get Gudrun back. Welcome back. - Ahlan! No, I mean hello. Please return to your seat. How about that? I was in ancient Egypt, Jørgen. Let's go and see the camels. - Yes, let's. Hey, stop! Why don't we look for the time machine? Why? To travel back in time and help the headmaster. It's just a circus act. The lady travelled to ancient Egypt. She was an actress. But it was a good act. Look, the camels. Wow. It's cute. - Yes. Their fur is so soft. Don't you want to pet it? Elias? - Elias? Elias? - Elias? Elias? - Elias? Elias? DANGER - RISK OF TIME LEAPS NO TRESPASSING Do you think he's...? What are you doing? Hey! It says "no trespassing". Lucia, it says "no trespassing". Hey. Hey. I think he entered the machine. - Then get him out. Elias? It's empty. Let's look outside. - Hang on a minute. 23rd of December, 1897. Viborg. It's just a stage prop for a magic act. What if it isn't? I have to find him. He's my responsibility. Elias? Elias? Elias? Elias? Valdemar? Do the one with the leg again. Great. And you can do that... Hey! What are you doing here? The performance isn't until tonight. I'm looking for a boy with the same jacket as me. Have you seen him? He probably went into town. - Which town? Well, where are we? - Viborg. And it is year 1897? - Of course. Why do you ask? Never mind. Thank you. The mystery of the lost children! The police has no clues. The mystery of the lost children! The police has no clues. Buy today's paper. - May I ask you a question? Do you want to see a real police badge? Jokumsen, show her yours. - Yes. You may touch it. - No thanks. I'm looking for a boy, this tall, with the same jacket as me. You've lost a boy? Sounds serious. It sounds like a crime. Do you think she's a criminal? Good question. Are you? Come on! He got lost when we were at the circus. Can you prove it? - Have you seen him or not? Listen up, my friend. A band of thieves are ravaging Viborg. The children in this town mysteriously disappear. So we don't have time for you and your brother's stupid hide-and-seek. Get lost. No. - Come on. Sit still. I can't work like this. Come on, open your mouth. Do you like the new boy at The Raven Nest? The little, annoying and curious one? - Can we use him? No, doesn't he seem a bit slow? - The Raven Nest... Dad, I changed my mind. - You have to. It'll teach you to brush your teeth. Come on, open your mouth. Let's scram. - That's it, my boy. Here you are. It'll be five pennies. - Yes, of course. What? My wallet. My wallet's gone! I've been robbed! Police! I've been robbed! - It was her. I saw it, too. - Get her! Stop in the name of the law! - It wasn't me. Stop! - In the name of the law! Get back here! Or... - Or what? Or... - Or no Christmas presents for you! Oh watchman the clock has struck eight when the dark blinds the earth... Hello there. Don't be afraid. - Who are you? I'm the night watchman. I know the town by heart. Where is The Raven Nest? - What is that? A place in this town. - You must have misunderstood. Look. I have a map of Viborg here. Look. There's no Raven Nest. What is this? - Raven Castle. It's an old deserted manor. Do you know how to get there? - Bomholt lives near Raven Castle. He delivers soda water to Buchwald's Inn and will pass by in a minute. Where is Buchwald's Inn? Down the street, and then left through a narrow alley. Thanks. - Wait. Karl Bomholt hates children! What do you mean? - Bottles are always missing here. Bottles are never missing here. - Well, well. I'll be off. See you. Excuse me! Are you Karl Bomholt? - What's it to you? Can I drive with you to Raven Castle? - Certainly not! Aren't you going that way? - Yes. And so what? Why can't I drive with you? - Because... You just can't. You should let her drive with you. - Out of the question. Children are noisy and smelly and they steal. Full stop. Goodbye. Just hop on. He'll never notice. RAVEN CASTLE Hi, little bird. Watch out, sis. Elias! Why are you here? - I want to help the headmaster. You promised to ask me first. You're my responsibility. That's your last soda pop. We're going home. No way. I'm not going home. - I promised your dad to babysit you. My dad can jump in a lake. He's always in charge. I have more fun at Baron von Raven's. Who's he? - Good evening, my dear children! Martin, are you ready? There you go. Yes! Fantastic. Girls, may von Raven have a little go at this? Two, three, four, one! Good evening, young lady. My name is Baron von Raven. Who do I have the honour of meeting? Lucia. - Welcome, Lucia. These two are my trusted minions, The Rat and Lord Wheedling. Hi. - Listen... Lucia... Are you also tired of stupid adults who always want to be in charge? Yes, a little. Then it's a good thing that we have The Raven Nest, right? You see, here in The Raven Nest we're all one big, happy family. Here, you see... the children are in charge. And each and every day should be what? A party. - And a bed of roses. Exactly. It's an old proverb I once made up. So here, you can do anything you want to? Yes, by and large. We've only got one simple rule here. No one can enter von Raven's office. Children are not allowed. Exactly. And why is it that no one can enter my office? Offices are for boring adult stuff. We children are here to have fun. Isn't it simply fantastic? So all the town's missing children are here? I wouldn't put it like that. "Missing"? They've just found a new and better home. What about their parents? They miss them. It's getting late. Kids, it's time for the evening count! What did you bring for Raven Dad? Oops, what do we have here? Righto. Let's see what it is. Wow, this is nice! Yes, and what do we have here? What's this? Oh, yes. Excellent. Ooh! There we go. This must be our record for December. Wow! Brilliant! A toothbrush? What on earth? Never mind. What about you, Elias? Oh, a gold watch! - Elias, did you steal? Before you say anything, Lucia, - - you should know that it pains me that we have to turn to stealing. You have to understand that all these stolen goods - - are naturally passed on to the poorhouse - - and the needy children of this town who at Christmas... What are you doing? It's for the poor. - How do you know? Only a modest little amount stays with us - - so we can have the bare necessities. Such as chocolate, soda pops and cakes. Isn't that right, cheeky Elias? It's true. The poor get the money. All of it. Hello! Hello! He's all gone. There's no change for the better? - No, on the contrary. He's disappeared into his own world. Does he eat enough? He looks a little pale. He's stopped taking nourishment altogether. It's no good. - No. Did you try giving him rice pudding? - Who said rice pudding? It wasn't me. You misheard her. Claudia said that she finds mice off-putting. There, there. Good. Was it you who said "rice pudding"? Cheers! There's a meeting by the fire in the living room! Can I have a soda pop, please? - Here you are. Hello. What's your name? - Margrethe. Have you been here long? - For three weeks. Did all of you... get candy? - Yes! Splendid. Then, let's start. Here, you see the old, - - stone deaf and blind as a bat Jens Boye's merchant's yard. And why am I showing you this? Well, I do so - - because it's here we are to commit the heist to end them all. A heist so spectacularly done - - and contrived by my brilliant brain that it will write history. A heist so great - - that everyone... at the town's orphanages - - and poorhouses - - will never again worry about Christmas presents. The heist will take place tomorrow. Christmas Eve. Tomorrow, we will rob Santa's sleigh! What? - Brilliant, right? Look, we need an angry cat. Rice pudding. Castor oil. A ladder. A horse carriage with one horse. We start here. At the gate to Jens Boye's merchant's yard. Jens Boye has a fierce old watchdog. Brutus is its name. A bloody mutt. But there's one thing it doesn't like. First obstacle out of the way. Now we just wait until the clock strikes ten. The clock has struck ten And then it's time for little Lis - - to prepare Santa's late-night snack. The door is locked, of course. But this won't be a problem. Santa lands on Jens Boye's roof at ten o'clock sharp. We know this from The Rat who worked there last Christmas. Jens Boye wants... slippers. Santa Claus is known for his great love of rice pudding. Naturally, Lis has put a bowl for him there. "For Santa Claus. Bon appityte." How cute. He'll pay dearly for this weakness. The hungry Christmas fool. Oh, no. Oh, God. No pooing in the Santa suit. Now that Santa is out of the way, - - we can proceed to the next step of the plan. While Lord Wheedling and The Rat empty the sleigh of presents, - - I sneak into the old merchant's house. Here, I borrow his glasses and his ear trumpet. But I leave him his old gun. Now, all that remains is my very last brilliant move. To lock up Santa Claus in Jens Boye's loo. Hello? Then we can enjoy my genius masterpiece of a heist. While Santa Claus is busy in the shit house. Let me out! The noise from the desperate Santa has woken up old Jens Boye. Oh, no. - Help! Let me out! The loo door is a heavy oak door. I'll pump you full of lead. Where are you? - Let me out! Let me out! Who is it? - You won't believe it. But it's me, your Santa. - You're stealing my decanter? You're stealing from me? I'll shoot your buttocks off. Stop, you damned thief! Give me my decanter! At this point, the empty sleigh would normally send Santa after us. Luckily, we have the angry Jens Boye - - to scare away Santa. Meanwhile, we quietly bring the presents home to Raven Castle. Come on! Finish. A beautiful plan, right? This is a grand heist, Raven Dad. - You're a genius. Yes, Margrethe. Isn't it wrong to rob Santa? He's making children happy. Thank you... for a very good question, Margrethe. Yes, I'm glad that you ask this question. I'm really glad that you asked. You see, the fact of the matter is that Santa Claus... really isn't as good as he's pretending to be. Doesn't he only bring presents once a year? And is it not him that single-handedly decides - - who has been bad and who has been good? Can you tell me why he alone should determine this? And have you ever wondered why he has never ever - - come to us with presents? The truth is that Santa Claus doesn't care about us. Oh, no, it's only those who can afford a chimney - - and a fancy Christmas tree who get presents. That bloody Santa! No, what we are doing here is - - that we take from the ones who already have, - - and then we give to those who are very much in need. It's the poor children who should get the presents. Not the rich ones! Will you follow me, children? - Yes! Soda pops for all! Is that Santa the headmaster? - Yes. So von Raven's heist is what made the headmaster crazy? It must be. We can't let him do it. - No. We have to stop it. Von Raven, I can't fall asleep. Elias, do you lie awake thinking of your angry dad? No, I lie awake thinking of the heist tomorrow. I see. Yes, well... As a child I invented this little trick - - called... counting sheep. There aren't any sheep in our room. - Sheep? Where? Ah, I see. I simply imagined the sheep. I imagined a lot of sheep in my head. They came leaping by, and I got more and more sleepy and fell asleep. If I have to make up the sheep, then I'll know how many they are. Yes, eh... They are infinite, Elias. You just have to count them. - How do you count infinity? Just bloody count as many as you can. And in the end, you'll fall asleep. What kind of sheep? - What kind? Yes, from Iceland, Greenland or a third country? You'll have to find out yourself. Just count them. And get back to bed. It'll be goats, then. - Goats? They are cooler. Well, good night. It was nice chatting to you. Goats. Crazy kid. Are you ready? This office is rather boring, right? Why does he want to hide this place? Elias? Why doesn't that boy listen to anything I say? Elias? Elias? Elias, where have you been? - I just touched the card. Which card? - This one. You mean this one? - Yes. What's happening? Look, Lucia. A treasure! It must be all the stuff the children steal in town. No, it's for the poor. No, Elias. Von Raven keeps it all for himself. The poor don't get any of this. - Then he's a liar. Yes. And a giant turd. What should we do? - We have to tell the others. And stop this crazy heist. Come on. Shit. What? - He's coming. What's he doing? He's coming. Hurry! Down! Do as I say. Now, let's see what we have today. What do we have here? Ah! A pearl necklace. I love pearl necklaces. And what do we have here? Oh. A gold watch. Yes, yes, yes. Let's see what it says here. "From Mum and Dad". Thank you so much, Mum and Dad. What do you have here? - Do as I say. Understood? - Yes. I love gold. What about a little picture? Yes! It will be good. I'm so... Let's see. Righto. Yes, like this. That's it. And then... And then just... Fantastic! Oh, I'll be darned. Oh, my God, it's late. Did he just take a selfie? Yuck, what a complacent guy. - I think he left. Let's get out of here. How are you? - How do you do? How do you do? You look fantastic. - You look fantastic! Elias and I discovered that the loot never reaches the poorhouse. Von Raven keeps it all. - There's no money at Raven Castle. Yes, there is. We found a secret room with all the loot. So he tricked us? - Von Raven only caters to himself. Do you have proof? Look at this. - My God, he's the biggest show-off! What do we do now? - We have to stop von Raven. We won't let him rob Santa and ruin Christmas for all children. It's locked. Let me. What on earth is going on? - Explain what you're up to. I'm doing some bookkeeping, distributing money to poor children. Yeah, right. You're keeping all the money yourself. I'd never dream of doing such a thing, Lucia. Then what is this? It's a fake picture. It's clear to see that this isn't me. Move it! Raven Dad, are you okay? - Yes. Your dear Raven Dad is a fraud. - Nonsense! No one is less of a fraud than me. I'm the world's least fraud. Yeah, right. Elias. The door. It's not there. - What? The card is gone. Where is the card that opens the secret room? I have no idea what you mean. The secret room behind the painting. I saw it with my own eyes. The room in there is not at all secret. SCANDINAVIAN-AMERICAN SEA LINES It's empty. - Yes, of course it is. What did you expect? - Last night it was full of gold. This room was built so that we could hide here if the police comes. There has never been gold or money in here. Where did you hide the money, you fraud? Maybe it's you who are the fraud here. Why are you trying to turn my dear Raven kids against me? Can't you see what she's doing to us? She's trying to poison our relationship, - - so that we lose trust in one another. But she's got enough money. Look at her clothes. Nice and clean. Just like her teeth. - He must've moved all the loot. I won't let you shatter my dream of helping poor children. Come on. You stay here. Hey, stop. Don't let him rob Santa Claus. He'll spoil Christmas for all children! I'm so disappointed in you. How could you believe her? Yes, Margrethe. But do we have to rob Santa? - I'm bloody sick of your questions! You want to join the two cowards? - No. How can I ever trust you again? I'm sorry, von Raven. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, von Raven. - What did you say? I'm sorry, von Raven! - What? Okay, kids. You're forgiven. The Rat will soon be here with the cat. Come on, kids. There's nothing to be scared of. Get the ladder up. Now we just miss The Rat. There he is. Wait just a minute. Yes, you almost had me there. If it wasn't for Elias, I wouldn't have noticed that you were on to me. I managed to empty the room in time, so there's no loot. What a lot of nonsense. - See this little souvenir. You'll go to prison for this. What is it? - No, because tomorrow... Tomorrow, I sail to America. With a lot of gold and all Santa's presents. So... Merry Christmas to you. And may you rot in here. We'll be alright. What if we never get home? We'll get home. I just have to figure out how. You came back! - Lis persuaded us. There's something rotten about Raven. - He's a liar. Look. I'll give him a beating! How do we get into town? - If we walk, it'll take us a day. We can run. - I'd wish we had a horse carriage. We've got one right there. Brewer Bomholt hates children. - We can't let that stop us. Move aside. Hey! Stop! Can we ride with you? - Is it you again? Go away. We need your carriage. It's urgent. - Don't give me that! Get lost. Christmas is in danger if you don't help us. And so what? I hate Christmas almost as much as I hate children. Thor, will you handle this? Give us a lift! Are you holding on? - Yes! Come on. Giddy up. Faster. Come on. Thanks for the ride. Merry Christmas. Well... a bit of merry Christmas to you, too. Here's the plan. Margrethe, Lis and Elias come with me. We have to get to the merchant before von Raven starts his plan. The rest of you hurry to the police and tell them everything. Now it's just the three of us. The other sissies got cold feet. Good evening. Good evening. The thing is to stay focused. Are you ready? - Yes. The Rat is ready. - The cat. Wasn't it your job to handle the cat? I've decided that it's probably better that I keep watch. Get going. Fantastic! Marvellous. Brutus? Where's the dog? - I think we're in luck. Brutus must have fallen asleep upon eating the rice pudding. Help me untie the horse from the carriage. How lucky can a boy be? What are you doing? We're in a hurry. - Okay. I'm coming. Raven Dad, what shall I do with the cat? The cat? Place it by those barrels over there. You empty the sleigh, I'll handle the rice pudding. Or should we call it the fart pudding? Come on. Let's place the ladder. Okay, now. Come and help me. I think it's stuck. - Go to the end of the ladder. Stupid dog door! Jens Boye... Ugh! Here you are. Bloody hell. A pot of piss. Good evening, little Rat. - What are you doing here? We don't want rats on the roof. Help! Help me, Raven Dad! It's that girl again. Help! Help! Help me! Help! Mummy! Help! Help! Mummy! Let go, mutt! Uninvited guests. - Ouch! What's this? You two darned thieves! Get out! Or I'll pump you full of lead! What's this? What are you doing in my loo? Good evening. - Scram! Get lost! - Yes, of course. Hurry, or I'll pump you full of lead. - They are the ones you must arrest. Don't you run off now. You lout. Funny. I don't suppose any of you gentlemen know - - where I can find a chamber pot? Von Raven, you are arrested for theft, fencing, - - luring of children, squatting, stealing horses. And for bringing Christmas in danger. - Caught with your pants down. Shut up, you evil woman. - Seize him, Jokumsen! You come with me. You're a high-hat. Come on, guys. Robbing Santa. That's really shoddy. You'll go straight to prison. - We were stupid. When something sounds too good to be true, it's false. May I run home to Mum and Dad? - You all have to run home. I hope my mum isn't angry. - She's not. Your parents love you. It'll be the best Christmas surprise when you return home. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Margrethe. Merry Christmas. Come on. Let's get back to the time machine. What if the circus has left town? They haven't. Set the machine to Greenland, 23rd of December, 2022. Perfect. Come on. I'm sorry, Valdemar. - I was right. It was just a magic act. - A magic act? What's this, then? An old-fashioned soda pop. - It works. Come on, hurry up. - Where are we going? To the academy to make the headmaster change his stupid law. You just entered the machine two seconds ago. So he wanted to rob Santa's sleigh and keep the presents? Right. - I'm glad you stopped him. Yes, and now the headmaster has no bad Christmas memories. Where are you going? No guests allowed. Especially children. What are you doing here? Why aren't you at the circus? It sounds mad, but we've cured the headmaster. We travelled to 1897 and prevented what made him fear Christmas. Nonsense. - It's true. Are you listening to a little girl? - I'm not a little girl. Doctor Herz, look. - What's this? Where's the damaged hat? - It's the same hat. I looked away and as I turned around, the hat was no longer damaged. The kids might be telling the truth. - I simply can't believe it. "Christmas is terrible. Awful! It should be abolished!" "Christmas! The most wonderful time of the year." "Rubbish! It has to be cancelled. For the sake of the children." "Not at all. Christmas is the absolutely best time of the year." "You don't understand..." - Why is he still weird? "Twit!" "Who are you calling a twit?" It definitely looks like a duo personalis dialogicum. You mean he's talking to himself? - Yes, you can put it like that. Anton and Mikkel, can you please... "You're the twit here." "I don't want to be a twit." "You're the master twit." "Oh, no, now there are more twits." I don't understand. - He must be stuck between memories. Perhaps the new memory isn't strong enough. Let's hypnotize him, so he remembers his good memory. Hypnosis is no go. It's quackery. Stop. We saw them do it in the circus. We've no time to get the headmaster to the circus. Impossible. I can do it. - You? We might as well try. It can't get worse than this. Unless he finds a third headmaster to talk to. I need a pendulum. As a doctor, I have to say I don't approve of this. But now... I've said it. Good. We'll begin. I'm sure that you can do it. I'm not the least nervous. Totally calm. Look at my hand. Totally still. Almost. Only the future of the academy is at stake. And the headmaster's. Keep quiet. - Quiet. I need to concentrate. Go on, honey. Your eyelids get more and more heavy. You are sleepy. You only listen to my voice. Only to my voice. Pull yourself together. - What happened? Sorry. Carry on. Breathe... calmly. Headmaster, feel how your eyelids get more and more heavy. You are sleepy. You only listen to my voice. Only my voice. Now we're going on a small journey. But everything's just fine. When I snap my fingers, you're back at Christmas Eve, 1897. Three, two, one. Tell me what you see. I see Jens Boye's merchant's yard and prepare for landing. Oh, it's such a beautiful, starry night. The perfect night for delivering presents. What was that? The sweet Jens Boye has left rice pudding for me. I love rice pudding. I don't think anyone loves rice pudding more than me. Oh, well, I'd better get going. Giddy up, Rudolf! Giddy up! When I snap my fingers, you wake up - - with these good memories of a lovely Christmas Eve in 1897. Three, two, one. Good morning, headmaster. How are you feeling? - Fantastic. Splendid. I had the most wonderful dream. - It's beginner's luck. What are you doing here? - We just fixed your nut. You were all gone. - You were in 1897. 1897? But isn't there something you have to handle right now? The crazy law that cancels Christmas. - Cancels Christmas? You can read it here. What on earth was I thinking? I'm such a fool! Dear friends, Santas, wives, children, elves and everybody else. I hope you'll accept my sincere apology - - for all the confusion and alarm my embarrassing little episode - - has created at the academy. But thanks to Elias' and Lucia's enormous feat, - - the mistake was straightened out. Please give them a hand. The law that abolishes Christmas and Santa hats - - is hereby annulled. Christmas is saved! Bravo. Wait. I've got something to say. Even if you think I'm just a child. Please speak, Lucia. I suggest we change the statutes of the academy, - - so that the headmaster can't pass laws without a vote. This has to stop! Naturally, the academy needs a leader. Someone who is good and wise like you are, headmaster. Thank you. Let's remember that everyone can make a mistake or lose common sense. Perhaps a little. Or can be egoistic and greedy even though they claim the opposite. We have to change the laws so that one person can't decide alone. All new rules and laws shall demand a vote. Both children and adults shall have the vote. Because we all share this academy. - Bravo! It has to be the wisest person that rules. Or it'll all end in chaos. People don't know what is best for them. They need guidance. A good, wise and strong man. Just like it's always been. I refuse. You're outvoted, Kalorius. - Yes, but I protest. And leave. - You're of course welcome to leave. I hereby make my final decision as an absolute ruler - - that the majority vote will decide at the academy from now on. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Olrik. We got our Christmas after all. And all the presents will be delivered in time. What a beautiful evening. There's Yulius. - Merry Christmas! Hello. - Have a nice trip, Dad. Thor! Erna, Thor is home! Lis! Margrethe, is that you? - Dad! How are you, Rat? - The Rat is mad. Merry Christmas. Bleurgh. I'll pass.
