- Starting compressions. - Let me get it attached. - One, two, three. Breathe. - Stand by and... - One, two, three. Breathe. - Yeah, we're good. One, two, three. Breathe. One, two, three. Breathe. Come on, baby. Come on. Still nothing. Come on. Will she be okay? Who's going to tell him to brush his teeth before breakfast now? Or go to Costco to buy the right Nivea? I'm sorry. I know there's thousands of parents every year who go through this. I can do this. I'm strong. I hope. Thank you for sharing, Cheryl. This can be so challenging. Especially for parents like us who spend more time with their children than most. But if I remember correctly, there's actually one other parent here going through the same thing. Diane? How do you feel? How do I feel about... Chloe's going to college in a few months. How do you feel? Good. Good? Come on, Diane. You can be honest with us. Okay. Uh, first of all, we haven't heard back yet from colleges, so nothing's confirmed. But as far as how I feel? I've been taking care of Chloe for 17 years and in all that time, I haven't traveled, gone out, or dated. And she's going somewhere where she gets to do all of that and more. So, yeah, I feel goddamn great. But what about... I mean, Chloe is... Smart? Brave? Faced more emotional and physical challenges from the moment she was born than most adults ever will? Chloe is the most capable person I know. If there's someone to not worry about, it's her. See whereas before it was important. It's how you know I did my Lit homework. - Yes, very good. - Mmm-hmm. Just a little over. - Lift up. - Mom! Thank you. ...five, six... Seven, eight, and exhale. Now, switch. So, morning, we will do an hour and 30 in Physics and maybe only 45 in Lit, since I just gave you a few long chapters. And then, second half of the day, you can move on to Bio. - Cool? - Cool. Hey, Chloe. Mail's here. Jesus, Chloe. Inhaler, please. I'm fine. I told you. If there's even one college letter, I will close my eyes and deliver it straight to you. Get back to work, Chloe. I beat my record on the arm bike today. - You did? - I did. Sixty-one. - Hmm. - Dangerously low. Sixty-one is barely low. - Hmm? - Damn it. At University of Washington, be boundless. Located near downtown Seattle on the shores of the Union and Portage Bay... When's the last time we saw a movie? I don't know. Mmm-hmm. What's wrong with it? I don't know. Wiring, maybe? Hmm. If I had an iPhone, I could probably tell you, but, you know... Yeah, yeah, you'll figure it out. - Night, Mom. - Good night, baby. Hi. Can you smile for the camera? Look up here. Bye. Well, do you like your cake? You do, don't you? - Can Mommy have some? - Hmm? Can you say, "Hi, Mommy"? Let Mommy have a bite. Hi, Chloe. - Hi. - Hey. Hello? Hi, Doctor Qasabian. Could... I'm sorry, could you give me one second? I have terrible reception in the house. Just let me step outside. Mom? Ooh. By the way, Doctor Qasabian called earlier. Apparently, the company that makes Zocor went under. - Oh. - It's crazy, right? Anyway, she wrote a new prescription to replace it and I picked it up today. What's wrong? I thought this was yours? Mine? Why would you think that? I was looking for the chocolates this afternoon. In the Kroger bag. Had your name on it. Sweetie, I adjust your dinner so you can have some. More than that is bad. - You know that. - I know. I'm sorry. Principal Nguyen called. Asked if I could sub Calculus tomorrow. I'm gonna leave your work on the table, okay? Your name was on the prescription. My name was on the receipt. - But it was looped... - Looped around the side. Yeah, that's where they put the receipt. Good night. Come on. Mom? Is that you? - Oh! - Jesus! Sorry. Sweetheart, I told you, if it's from a college, you will open it. You done with Bio? Oh, just finishing up. How was subbing? Awful. I'm gonna get my stuff. Trigoxin. Huh. You figured it out. Oh. Yeah. Just like you said. Yeah, just like I said. Night, Mom. Love you. Love you too, sweet tooth. That's way too long! How do you suppose... No, no, no. I am looking at the agreement right now and nowhere does it say that you can keep a customer in the dark for that long. Well, even if I... No, no, no. Please do not put me on hold. I had to wait for 20 minutes just to talk to you. Is this how you treat everyone who calls? It's customer service. Yes, I am still here. So, there's nothing you can do, then? And you'll let me know... Yeah, fine. Goodbye. How long will it be down for? Oh, I don't know. Tomorrow, next week. The window they gave was till the end of the month. How did you know that was about the Internet? I used the computer last night. When? While you were asleep. What were you looking up? Why my printer keeps dying. I was trying to fix the module board, but it might just need a better nozzle. - Does it? - I don't know. There wasn't Internet. Pasco Pharmacy. Hi, uh, I was wondering if you could look up a medication for me. It's called Trigoxin. It's spelled... Diane, is that you? Just recognized the number you're... Thank you for calling 411. Your phone's directory assistance. To begin, say a city and state like Derry, Maine... Seattle, Washington. Did you say, "Seattle, Washington"? Yes. I'm sorry. I didn't get that. Yes! Okay. Now say the name of the business you want. If you don't know the name of the business, tell me the type of business you're looking for. Like "Pizza" or... Pharmacy. Okay. When you hear the one you want, repeat the number of the listing. Number one. Evercreek Pharmacy... Number one. Evercreek Pharmacy. 2180 Southwest Barton Street, Seattle, Washington. If that's correct, say "connect me." Connect me. Okay, I'll connect you. Remember, once the line rings, a 99-cent service charge will be added to your next bill. Ringing now. Hello, who's this? Hello, um, hi. You don't know me, and this is gonna sound very strange. Is this a sales call? No, I'm not selling anything. You're one of those donation people, then? How many times do I have to tell you to take my number off the list? No. No donations. I'm not a charity. My name is Chloe Sherman. - I'm 17 years old and I live in... - Hold on. Baby? Baby, I see you peekin' through the window. Listen, I told you. Paola is just a friend. Paola! No, no, no. Where you goin'? So, you just dialed a random number? I don't have Internet or a cell phone and I need your help with a very urgent Google search. Ask your parents. Tell you what, amorcito, next time Paola even tries to hug me, I'mma punch her in the face. I'm an orphan. No, no, no, where are you going? Wait! Listen, I'm putting out a goddamn fire here. I really don't have time to help some stranger. Please, it'll only take a minute. You don't know who I'm dealing with, okay? This girl straight up refuses to listen to logic! Baby, I was just kidding, please. She'll come around. Oh, 'cause you know her so well? Because you sound like a really... ...level-headed and reasonable guy. That's 'cause I'm a really level-headed and reasonable guy. And clearly, Paola couldn't keep her hands off you. She'll be back. What the hell you need so badly? I need you to open up Google and look up the word "Trigoxin." T-R-I-G... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on. This is the weirdest thing I've ever done. Clicking Google... All right, what was it again? T-R-I... T-R-I-G-O-X-I-N. Okay. Uh... Got it. "Trigoxin is a brand name drug" "that treats severe heart conditions" "including atrial fibrillation," "flutter, or heart failure." Jesus, this is intense. Can you click on "Images"? Is this what you take? Yes, please just tell me what you see. Uh, pills, just lots of pills. Do they all look the same? Yeah, they're identical. What color are they? Hello? That's all you wanted to know? Trigoxin, little red pill. Hello? What the hell are you? When's the last time we saw a movie? What do you wanna see? Come on, I don't want to miss trailers! I don't know. I just don't wanna miss the trailers. I just wish this guy would move. Like, go faster, you know? Sometimes, being in a sleepy town makes things challenging. I'm not waiting on you. We still have to get candy... Oh, great. Look how good I am. I need to pee. What? Just tell me what I miss. No. Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me. I need to get past. Thank you. Excuse me. Okay, there's three pills and you want to take them with food. Excuse me. I'm very sorry to bother you but I was hoping you'd be so kind and let me cut in line? What? No. I've been waiting here... Yeah, of course. - Go ahead. - Thank you. Sorry, everyone, cutting through. I'm paralyzed. Feel bad for me. Hey, Mrs. Bates. Oh, my goodness. Chloe, are you okay? Yeah, totally fine. Actually, I'm dealing with a tiny emergency right now and I could use your help. Of course, honey. What do you need? What's the name of this pill? What? My mom came here last week. She got these pills. I need to know the name of the medication. - That's all you need to know? - Yes. Next time, you wait your turn, okay? Yes, Mrs. Bates. It shouldn't be too hard though, as long as it's under your name. They're under my mom's. I'm sorry, Chloe. But if they're under Diane's name, - I really can't help you. - Why? Because it's confidential, meaning... I know what confidential means, Mrs. Bates! I'm confused though, sweetheart. Tell me again, why can't you ask your mom about these pills? Honey? It's a game. A game? What kind of game? A scavenger hunt. Really? Yes, yes! 100% yes. Mom and I love scavenger hunts. So many memories of scavenging and hunting and... Anyway, the next clue is about the medication Mom takes and I don't think she expected me to come here which is why I really need you to help me win. I love games. But confidential is confidential. I'm sorry, honey. I really wanna help you, but I can't if they're all under... Huh. I think it's a trick question. - Why? - Because your mom doesn't get these prescribed for herself. Yes, she does. I saw them. She had them in her bag and her name... She gets them for your dog. We share a pharmacy with the vet next door. The answer you're looking for is Ridocaine. Green pill, gray cap. - It's dog medicine. - Uh-huh. Says it's a "muscle relaxant" "prescribed to reduce canine leg pain or leg discomfort" "caused by sunburns, bites, or cuts." And what would happen if you gave a human being Ridocaine? What kind of a question is that? Chloe? Chloe! You guys are serious about games. What would happen? Chloe! I... I suppose, your legs could go numb. Chloe! Chloe! What happened? What happened to you? Are you okay? What did you do? What did you say? She just started breathing like that. No. No. Chloe. Look at me. You're gonna be okay. - Ice bucket. - On it. Please! Will you please give us some space? Back off! It's gonna be okay. No. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. You're okay. Here. It's okay. I've got you. I've got you, sweet girl. Hey, Kathy, it's me. Do you have a sec? I wanted to apologize for that whole scene today. You know, her doctor switched her to that new medication a few days ago and it's just totally messed with her head. I appreciate that, Kathy. I'm trying. Well, anyway, I know she asked you a few questions about another medication and I was just hoping you could remind her there's no way I would ever give her a drug that was meant for animals. I was wondering if you could give her a call and assure her that even if she was taking that medication... I just need you to tell her that it's perfectly safe. Mom? Are you there, Mom? I just wanna talk. Can we do that? I'm sure there's a good explanation for everything. Can we just talk and you can tell me? Please? Mother... Chloe? Help... Help... What happened? - Okay. - She saw me. She saw me. She saw me. Wait here. Tom? Tom, is she bleeding? Is she okay? - Is she okay? - Diane, I'm sorry. Chloe just told me something that... I don't give a shit what she told you, Tom! Is she hurt? - Is she hurt? - She said that you hurt her. She said I hurt her? She told you I hurt my own daughter? Tom... The doctor changed her medication four days ago and it has messed with her head. I just came from the hospital. She doesn't know what she's saying. Look, Ms. Sherman, I'm sure you're right, but she just looks really bad. Really bad? What happened to her? Look, I think it's best right now if we just... Wait a second. I'm supposed to believe that my daughter... My young daughter was found by you, an adult man, bleeding or bruised from God knows what and now, you won't let me talk to her? Let's see what they think, hmm? I don't think there's reception. How long have you known me, Tom? How many diseases and disorders do you think I've had to deal with? How about people like you? Normal, healthy people, who think they're helping when they're actually just making it worse? You wanna help? Then believe a mother when she tells you her child is sick! Will you please, please, I am begging you... Let me take her home. I just... I can't. It's okay. Would it be all right if I followed you both to the hospital? Yes, absolutely. - Yeah. - Thank you. Hospital or police? Police. I'll drive really slow. Thank you. Yeah, of course. Oh, and if any of those boxes fall down or... Will she be okay? Chloe... What are you doing? - You're not my real mom? - Yes. Yes, I am. I am. I'm your mom. - Then who are they? - No one. They don't matter to us. You took me from them. I saved you from them! Sweetheart, no one in the universe loves their kid more than I do. Everything I do, everything is for you, Chloe. Was I ever actually sick? Tell me one time I wasn't a good mom to you. Tell me one time, huh? Could I walk? My heart beat normal? I... I wasn't covered in rashes? You were sick. You know how many times I had to take you to the hospital? - You poisoned me. - Shh! Protected. I protected you. These? Gone. We start over. We forget all of this. Just like it used to be. Hmm? Oh... He's fine. He's just sleeping. Honey... Everything I did... Was for you, Chloe. Honey, will you take my hand? You didn't do this for me. That's not true. You did this for you. No. That is not true. Mom? What are you doing? Mom, what are you doing? Mom? Mom, please. Why do you have that, Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom, what are you doing? Mom? Mom! What are you doing? Please don't do something bad. Please... Please, Mom! Please! Please, Mom! Mom! Please... No! No! Mom, no! Mom, please, no! Mom, please! I don't wanna die! Hey! Hey! Do not say that! I would never... Please, Mom! Sweetheart. Sweetheart, open the door. Honey. You may not understand this now, but I am doing what I know is right for you. So, please, don't be scared, and don't cry. I am not going to hurt you. This is gonna make you forget all of this. And when you wake up, I'll be right by your side. And you'll be my baby. Forever. Sweetheart! Please open the door. Sweetheart? Sweetheart... Hi... You need me. No! No! No! No! No! No! No, no... No! No, no! My God, no! No! No! I'm sorry. You said she was stabilized. She is. But attempted suicide as an adolescent immediately categorizes her as a high-risk patient. A mental health physician needs to evaluate Chloe and assess the likelihood of another incident. When will that happen? Today. When she can talk again. Which, um, reminds me to ask you. It says here that, uh, Chloe's primary doctor has changed, uh, more than a dozen times in the last six years... Hey, what's up? What? You wanna write something? I actually can't let you use this. It's a safety thing. But... This could work. Try it slowly. Code Blue. 507 West. Patient in critical condition. I'll be right back. Code Blue. 507 West. Patient in critical condition. Breathe. It's been stuck in my head all night, what you said. I know that I've scared you. And I know that I've hurt you. But I promise I will spend every minute of our lives making sure you never feel that way again. And you were right. I do need you. And you know, deep down... You need me too. You've always needed me. I'm your mom. Did someone just move the patient from 511 West during the Code Blue? Uh, I don't think so. Then why is her bed... Security to South Wing. All security to South Wing immediately. I... Don't... Need you. You will. Put the gun down! We are going home! - How you doin', Chloe? - Same as last month. You? - Same as last decade. - Need help? I'm good. My walk's gotten better. Trainer says it may improve, or it may not. But I'm happy either way. Oh, Annie's learning how to walk too. Still looks like Godzilla when she's doing it, but, you know, it's coming along. She got to hang out with all her grandparents over Christmas. I think she likes mine more. Ara's good. Still kinda hates his job, but we're figuring that out. Oh, I got to put legs on a 7-year-old last week. That was awesome. It was this adorable little boy named Kay. And it was his first pair of legs, which is my favorite thing to do, you know? I know I've told you that giving someone their first prosthetics... It's good to see you, Mom. But I think it's time for me to go. I love you, Mom. Now open wide.
