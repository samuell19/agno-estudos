(SCREAMS) (SIRENS WAILING) (POLICEMEN CHATTERING) Who's in charge here? You got him. FBI? Oh, the victim's ID pegged him as some kind... Peter Hayward. We know who he is. So what is going on? That's classified. BARTLES: Who's that? It's the witness. She saw the killer. Is that right? Yeah. And the killer saw her. What's her name? Uh, Sarah McLeish. Thanks. Mrs. McLeish? My name is Bartles. He saw me. Who did? The man who killed... Can you describe him for me? (STAMMERING) I don't like standing here... All these people... I understand. Maybe you'd feel safer talking in the car? Come. (BARKING) No. Quiet, Hannibal. Let's talk in the car. Okay. I'm visiting Los Angeles and I was walking Hannibal and, um... You know, if Hannibal hadn't been with me, he might have killed me, too. You don't have to worry about that now. We'll look after you. In, Hannibal. Takano. I want round-the-clock protection on this woman. Yes, sir. What's your take on this? If she's the sole witness and he knows she saw him. If you were the killer, what would you do? ANNOUNCER: Amtrak Sunset Limited leaving for El Paso and points east. Track 12. All aboard! Oh, my goodness. Oh, we're late. Hurry! My only love. Good-bye, Boris. JESSICA: Wait! Oh! Hold it! I'm going on this train! You're gonna have to hurry, ma'am, because the Sunset Limited leaves in about two minutes. Ah, yes, I know. And I'm so sorry but I just have to get this on board. ANNOUNCER: Amtrak Coast Starlight departing for Seattle. Track 9. I'll just put it in the corner here. Yeah. Uh, perhaps over there would be better. It needs to be rather cool and dry. Cool and dry? Now that... That will be just perfect. (BARKING) Oh, my goodness, I'm glad that animal is caged. So am I. We don't carry animals but they said to load him anyway. The owner said it's been trained to attack strangers. And I wanna make sure I'm not one of 'em. Right. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) Oh, my! This is very cozy! Our deluxe sleeper. Oh, I'm sure I'll be very comfortable. It's a long time since I took this train. Almost 30 years. The bed is in here, ma'am. Uh-huh. And this is... Oh, yes. I can see. Are you going all the way to Florida, ma'am? No. Just to El Paso. I almost forgot. Would you like the first sitting or the second sitting for supper this evening? 6:30 or 8:30? I think the second sitting will be fine. I had a late lunch. And your name is? Mrs. Fletcher. May you have a peaceful journey, Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you. This doesn't seem to be working, Millie. Turn it the otherway, dear. The... The key? Yeah. Are you sure? (KEYS JINGLING) Oh, dear, I'm terribly sorry. Uh, we thought this was C-16. Oh, no. This is C-12. We got confused, didn't we, Jack? (LAUGHING) Yeah! They all look the same. Uh, well, actually, the numbers are right next to the door. Oh, of course, they are, Jack. See? Uh, did you look down in that direction? Uh, I think I saw 16 down there. Nice to meet you. Good-bye. Well, uh... Bye. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Thank you. Good evening, Madam. Are you waiting for someone? No. Just me. Oh. Well, if you don't mind sharing atable... Oh, not at all. Oh, hi! Hello, again! Isn't this train wonderful? Jack was just saying it was just like an old movie, weren't you, Jack? That's right! Yes, it is. Good evening. Maybe over there? Oh, would you... WAITER: I trust that this will be comfortable? Perfect. I'll get you a menu right away. Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. My name is Jessica Fletcher. Uh, Judy Taylor. Hello! This way, sir. So, after Steven died, I... I wasn't comfortable for the longest time traveling alone. Has that ever bothered you? Oh, |won't say that but, uh, I guess you get used to it. And on the positive side, you meet a lot of interesting people that way. Well, I have tonight. (LAUGHING) Anyhow, I haven't seen my little nephew, Charlie, well, since I left Denver and that was almost a year ago. But I'm afraid of flying so here I am. And where does Charlie live? Uh, Sanford, Florida. Oh. (MEN LAUGHING) They seem to be having a good time. Oh! Whatever. I think so. Maybe too good a time, if you know what I mean? Now, Millie. I think the young one's that tennis player, the one all the women chase after. Yeah. He played at Wimbledon last year. Ah. I don't know who the other man with him is though. He seems familiar to me. I don't think they knew each other before they got on the train. (LAUGHS) Why are you laughing? Well, it seems that we have something in common, Judy. We both like observing people, trying to see the truth behind the facade. (WAITER CLEARING THROAT) Have you ladies made a decision about dinner? Oh, thank you! Let's see, I'll have the, uh, garden salad vinaigrette to start with, baked swordfish with shitake mushroom sauce and a bottle of your Chardonnay. WAITER: Very good, sir. You never even thought about going back to the altar? (LAUGHS) I usually say that I'm having too much fun to get married again. But the truth is, there's never been anyone that could fill Frank's shoes. That's what I thought until... Judy? Oh, who would've thought that a romantic cabin next to a babbling brook would make it happen the second time. Well, I'm very happy for you. Oh, thanks. So, Jessica, where are you heading? Well, I have to give a lecture in El Paso, so I thought I'd take the opportunity to study some of the local desert flowers along the way. I say study. Actually, I am no expert. And what are you going to do with these flowers when you find them? Oh, I'll probably, um, collect them, make some notes. And they'll probably end up, as they usually do, in a novel of mine. Does that mean you're a writer? I'm afraid so. I... I'm sorry. I should have recognized your name. I'm just afraid I don't read many books. Oh, that's quite all right. Luckily, there are quite a few people who do. But I must read something of yours. What is it you write about? Murder. I write about murder. Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. How clumsy of me. No problem. No harm done. Oh... I should go change. Um, if the waiter comes, would you just tell him to leave my dinner and I'll be right back? Oh, sure. Thanks. EnJ'Â°Y! Mrs. Taylor? Mrs. Taylor? MAN: ls there a Mrs. Judy Taylor in the car? I have a message for a Mrs. Judy Taylor. Is there a Mrs. Judy Taylor in the car? Here! Excuse me, I... I'm not. Excuse me. I think I'd better pay for both. Oh, you don't have to pay now, ma'am. Um, you just leave your voucher with me, write down your compartment number, and settle up at the end of the journey. The other lady already gave me her number. Oh, well, then I'll do that. So you have my friend's voucher? Yes, ma'am. May I see it? Oh. C-34. Thank you. Thanks. I'm sorry. It's not easy getting around on these things. I'm looking for somewhere to sneak a smoke. Oh. I'm so sorry. I wasn't looking! It's my fault. Oh, that's very kind of you to say so, Mr... Uh, Cadrescu. Of course! You're Boris Cadrescu, the tennis coach on the Romanian national team. I resigned. Your newspaper reports are not always accurate. You know, since government left power, Romania can no longer support sports in the same way. I'm sure. Well, I suppose every freedom comes at a price. Sometimes I believe we pay too high price for this precious American freedom. Drugs, crime. These are things we never saw in our country with communists. And you're working here now? No, not yet. But it will be soon, I know. Excuse me. Judy? (TIRES SQUEALING) MAN: Yeah. Over there! One of the passengers pulled the emergency. I heard they saw someone fall from the train. Oh, my goodness! It's rather difficult to fall by accident, I would have thought, unless the door was open. But why would the door be open? MAN ON RADIO: Mark, everything okay? MARK: Got it. Yeah. All clear back here. Find anything? No. Not here. False alarm. MAN 1: Clear. MAN 2: This side's clear. MAN 2: Okay. Yeah, I'll do it. MAN 1: Nothing in the rear. MAN 3: Okay. I think we've got it. We've got it. We did that. Check 100 yards down. MAN 2: Hey, watch out for the snakes! MAN 3: Check that out. Right over there. MAN 1: Nope. Nothing. MAN 2: Okay. MAN 1: Yeah. Totally clear. MAN 1: Back here. MAN 3: Give it a once-over one more time. WOMAN: three-day trip and also there's a five-day one. Which one do you think... MAN: Oh, the five-day... WOMAN: Oh, really? MAN: Absolutely. WOMAN: We were wondering, um, do you happen to know... Sir? Hmm? Excuse me, sir? Excuse me, sir. We need to prepare this table. Hmm. Are we in Tucson yet? Uh, no, an unscheduled stop. Um, sir, dinner has been over for half an hour. And an excellent one, it was, too. My compliments to the chef. Now, if you'll excuse a four letter word, I must get to work. All right, Mrs. McLeish, where is it? WOMAN: There he is. MAN: All units attention at the rear, let's get everybody back on the train. MAN: Come on, people, let's board! Let's board! Mrs. McLeish, now you don't want to get hurt. So just tell me where it is. Who is McLeish? You are, lady. Sarah McLeish. Now, we know that Judy Taylor's just your cover, so cut the bull! But I'm not Judy Taylor! Mmm-hmm, and this isn't her compartment? Uh, yes. Yes, it is, but... Then stop wasting my time! Now you've got 10 seconds to give me an answer. So tell me where it is? Uh, oh, Sarah, there you are! Five seconds. Uh, Sarah, I could really use your help here! No more games, Mrs. McLeish. Three, two, one. A good chardonnay beats the right to bear arms every time. Oh. Thank you. He thought I was someone else. Yes. Sarah McLeish. Or you may have met her as Judy Taylor. Either way, I don't believe that he's familiar with the Top 10 bestseller lists, Mrs. Fletcher. Richard Loomis, Los Angeles Times. Oh, yes! I read your articles on the Chinese illegal immigrant trade. Oh, very thorough. Six weeks undercover. If I never eat dim sum again, I'll be a happy man. So, you know where Sarah McLeish is? Well, if, as you say, her alias is Judy Taylor, I haven't seen her since she left the dining car. Hmm, well, he doesn't have an ID, and I don't think that he works for Amtrak. Well, you seem very familiar with what's going on around here. I mean, do you know who he is or what he was after? Well, I know that I don't want him waking up and holding a grudge. (GRUNTING) (GAME BOY BEEPING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Just a moment. Who is it? Loomis. Oh, come in. Our gun-toting friend is hitchhiking the rest of the way. So why did he think that you were Sarah McLeish? Because of this. Now, he came into the dining car asking for Judy Taylor. And she wasn't there so I took it! Then he found you in her compartment and two and two made three. If he thought you were McLeish, Mrs. Fletcher, he may not be the only one. You may still be in danger. Well, it wouldn't be the first time. But what about Judy... I mean, Sarah? I didn't see her. I don't mean that. Why is she in danger and why is she traveling under an assumed name? A couple of weeks ago, I got a call from some government whistleblower named Peter Hayward. I figured $1,000 hammers, you know, the usual. But I did agree to meet him night before last downtown. Well, the Hollywood freeway was bumper to bumper, as usual, so I was late. Uh-huh, and you missed him? Well, you could say that. But someone else didn't. He had a .38-caliber slug in the back of his cranium. Oh! Sounds like a professional. I smell a major story here, Mrs. Fletcher. "Federal Snitch Silenced." You know, something like that. And Sarah? She witnessed the murder. One of the LAPD guys told me what she said before the FBI took her into protective custody. Seems she was walking her dog when she saw the killer leaning over the body. Now, he took something from Hayward and when he stood up, he saw her. She says that he stared at her just for a moment, and ran away. And now they want to silence Sarah. But who? Well, that's what I'm here to find out. Let's just hope that it isn't the FBI. Now, you said that she was walking her dog. Was that a German Shepherd? Oh, you're good. I saw it in the baggage car. You know, in all likelihood, Sarah isn't on the train anymore. You think she got scared and jumped off the train? Well, that's possible if she was afraid of being killed. She wasn't scared when she went to her compartment. She never would've taken the time to wash the wine off her sleeve. And she expected to go back to the dining car. But how do you know? Because she left her purse there. I think that Sarah has been kidnapped or even worse. We'd better make sure that she's absolutely not on this train first. Well, you take the front. And I'll meet you back here. Right. Oh! Say, Jessica, did you see all those men get off the train when we stopped? Oh, yes, I did. Jack said they were looking for something. Isn't that right, Jack? You're right, honey. Yeah. Well, they thought somebody fell off the train. MILLIE: (GASPS) |t'sjust like in that old movie. You know, Jack, the one with Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. Double Identity. Uh, Double Indemnity. Anyway, it turned out to be a false alarm. Excuse me. (DOOR OPENING) Rad ley? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. Oh, no. Not at all. Come on in. I apologize. It's the only place I could find. I'd have stepped off for a smoke when the train stopped but... You might have been left behind. Yes. I have to get back. Shall I leave you in the dark? I'd rather you didn't. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) JESSICA: Where is it, Mrs. McLeish? Where is what? (DOOR RATTLING) Who is it? (GROANING) 0h. my God! PORTER: Watch your step. MAN: You have to get out of their way. WOMAN DEPUTY: AH passengers except those in C... Oh, dear. remain on the train. All passengers except those in car C. I repeat, will all passengers except those in car C, remain on the train? All passengers except those in car C... Hey, excuse me. What's happening, Sheriff? Just a short delay, that's all. Just take it easy. We'll get you back on your journey as soon as we can. Right over here. It's an investigation. Whatever you say, dear. FBI. See? I told you so. Right, dear. Let's check over here first. MAN: Step to the rear of the platform, please. Now, let's get this straight. That news guy was shot right outside your door and you never heard it? That's right. Uh-huh. Mrs. Fletcher, I appreciate your help. Now, I just wanna make sure you're telling us everything we need to know. Everything that I can remember. Uh-huh! Would you like me to repeat it? Not just yet, Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you, Sheriff. I'll take it from here. Whoa! I don't take orders from anybody in Harland County, especially... Feds. SHERIFF: What're you doing here? National security. And we could use your help, Sheriff. We'll need written statements from all the passengers on the victim's train car. Thanks. Algric Bartles, FBI. Uh, special agent in charge of the Los Angeles Field Office. Now... Let's start from the top, shall we? Certainly. Your agency has managed to lose the only witness to the murder of a federal employee who was going to leak information that could compromise our government. Where did you get all this? I don't know where she is. Okay, Yes, I lost her, but... No! I'll get her. Whatever it takes. BARTLES: All right, Mrs. Fletcher, there's still something that puzzles me. When you realized the witness was missing after the train was stopped, why didn't you report it to the security officer on the train? Because at that time I didn't know that she was missing. Loomis and I were making sure that she wasn't still on the train when he was killed. You weren't sure? In other words, you were suspicious? Oh, now that's your word, not mine. What word would you use, Mrs. Fletcher? (SIGHS) Mr. Bartles, I was worried about a woman that I had befriended at dinner. There was an accident with the wine and she left the table. She said she'd be right back. It was only when she didn't return that I went looking for her. Because I was worried, not suspicious. But you're suspicious now, aren't you, Mrs. Fletcher? No, Mr. Bartles. Now I'm even more worried. All right, Mrs. Fletcher, you can return to the train. And leave everything to us. Oh, but what about Sarah? Who? Mrs. McLeish, sir. The witness. Mrs. McLeish is our concern now. I suggest you forget about her. I said forget about her, before you disappear off a train. Do you understand what I'm saying? Oh, yes. You've made your point very clearly. BARTLES: I want you to leave it to us, and get on that train and go to El Paso just like you planned to. You do that and I assure you no harm will come to you. You have my word on it. Is that what you told Sarah? (sums) (DOOR OPENING) Hello. Remember me? Uh, insulated container. Cool and dry. Exactly. I would like to ask you to do something for me. I'd like you to take my insulated container and put it on the platform at El Paso to be picked up by Mr. Cyrus Davis. Uh, could you do that for me? Oh, sure I could. Thanks. Cyrus Davis. Right. JARVIS: Let sleeping dogs lay, eh, ma'am? What is your name? Uh, Jarvis Bean, ma'am. My father was Jarvis Bean. I'm Jarvis Bean. Well, Jarvis, it's evident to me that you're a man who knows his trains. Been riding them all my life. That's what I thought. Uh, but could you tell me how many miles we've traveled since the train was stopped? How many miles? Uh-huh. I couldn't be sure about that. Uh, but could you tell me what our average speed was? Average? Oh, I'd figure 50 miles an hour. Fifty miles an hour. Ah. Well, now we started at 10:35, and we arrived at 1:31. So, let's say our journey was three hours at 50 miles an hour. One hundred and fifty miles. One hundred and fifty miles, Jarvis. Mmm-hmm. Thank you. (BARKING) Excuse me. Can I help you? Yes. I wondered if you might have a map of this area? A map. Certainly. Come on to my office. PHIPPS: We're at Hannay. Right here. JESSICA: Uh-huh. Now, if we were to travel a 150 miles west, would there be atown there? Well, let's see... Uh... Would 140 miles do? Because Agua Verde is the only town anywhere near there. And there's nothing else there? No. Nothing. Most of this is government or reservation land. Belongs to the Indians. Now, what is that symbol right next to the town? That's some kind of beacon. And what is the best way to get there? Well, you see that old car out there? I could rent you that if you're coming back. Oh, that's very kind but unfortunately I don't drive. You don't drive? No. And there's no other way to get there? Nope. Unless you're willing to take the bus. Well, what time does it get here? The train can leave in five... Five minutes. I thought we agreed you'd be on it. We did? Takano, let's see that Mrs. Fletcher gets safely back on the train, shall we? Sir, the helicopter's ready. If you could pick up the container at the station. Thank you. Don't worry, Cyrus, I'll be there for the lecture. Well, there was some trouble on the train. No, everything is fine but I seem to have lost a friend of mine. Well... Well, not exactly lost, but... Uh, well, look, I'll explain later. Right. Bye. It's here. What? The bus. Oh. Good. And, uh, thank you for the use of your phone. Are you sure you're gonna be safe? Well, why shouldn't I be? Traveling alone. Oh! It's a bus, Mr. Phipps, not a stagecoach. I see someone's rented your car? Yup. Hello. What's your name? Joe. Just Joe. Just Joe? (LAUGHS) Not just Joe. Joe. Mmm. Do you like to play games, Joe? Have you ever seen this one? Sure. I'm not very good at it. Maybe you can do better. (GAME BOY BEEPING) MAN ON RADIO: Downtown Los Angeles residents... Hoover says, "Are you a democrat or a republican?" He answered, "Yes, sir. Which would you like me to be?" Sir. Takano, can't this wait till I've finished eating? Uh, it's Mrs. Fletcher, sir. She wasn't on the train at El Paso. I knew she was gonna be a pain. Where did Guzman say she got off? He didn't. Ask him. We can't raise him, sir. He's not answering his pager and he's missed the last two check-ins. Get me Guzman's file, and run a financial report. Every dollar he's got or spent in the last five years. He never was a team player. I want him and that Fletcher woman found. Now. Come on. Excuse me. Ma'am? Didn't you want Agua Verde? Oh, yes. Thank you. It's coming up. Time to give it back now, Joe. I'd like you to borrow it for awhile. Really? Mmm-hmm. We couldn't do that. Dad. Oh, but I insist. Well, that's very kind of you, Mrs... Fletcher. Jim Sunrise. This is my wife, Pearl. Hello. What do you say, son? Thank you, Mrs. Fletcher. You're very welcome. Can I give you a ride? Oh. No, thank you. I need to walk. But perhaps you could suggest a good motel. Motel? There's an old hotel about three blocks up. Tell Dottie I sent you. She'll take care of you. Dome'? Thanks very much. (UNITELLIGIBLE CHATTER) MAN: Right? See what you gotta deal with that. Not me. Ah, how about that? Nah. Here. Here. (CHUCKLES) Ah. Good morning. Wait a minute. It can't be! Hillerman. Grafton. Francis. Fletcher. Yes, I thought so. That's you, isn't it, J.B.? (LAUGHS) Yes. I'm afraid so. Uh, you must be Dome. Jim Sunrise said to say hi. Are you working on a story? Oh, no. First, I'm working on a bed for tonight. Of course. Just fill this out and I'll need a credit card. Did my friend Sarah check in yet? Who? Sarah McLeish. Sometimes she uses her pen name, Judy Taylor. Oh, I get it. Another writer. She was to meet me here. No, not here. I could call you when she gets here, if you like? Oh, good. (PHONE RINGING) We've got her, sir. Agua Verde? That's the last place I want her to be. Let's go. WOMAN: Los Angeles Police Department. Uh, Lieutenant McRaney, please. (PHONE RINGING) McRaney. Mackie, it's Jessica Fletcher. Hey, long time no see. I want his statement on my desk today. Today. Yes, sir. Sorry, Jessica. You in town? I'm in Arizona. I don't think I'll be in Los Angeles for a while. You promised to let me buy you lunch next time you're in town. Well, I haven't forgotten. Listen, Mackie, I need a favor. Yeah, shoot. I need to find out about a murder. A victim who was killed in downtown Los Angeles a few nights ago. His name is Peter Hayward. I left my number at your office. Will you call me back? You got it. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Coffee? Oh, decaf, please. Out of decaf. Regular will be fine. (SCOFFS) Not in this place, it ain't. Pay no attention to him, hon. Something to eat? Oh, thank you. So, how long you in town for? Oh, just a couple of days. Uh, my friend is staying here with me. We're looking for flora. Don't reckon I know her. Oh. Flowers. I collect flowers. And my friend Sarah started off without me this morning. Uh, perhaps she came in here? She's about 5'8", brown hair. Nope. Why, I seen her. Where was that? Drug store. Last week. And she was with Elvis, right? Oh, come on! Don't start that again. You know that was an honest mistake. Heck for, you know, that could have happened to anybody. Anybody who was blind drunk. I was not blind drunk when I saw her. Yes, you were! Ah, but Sarah only came into town last night. She's probably out hiking already. Uh, which way are the railroad tracks? South of town. But don't go wandering on government property. That's where those cattle upped and vanished last fall. Fifty head. Just like that. And what does the government have out there? I heard it's biological weapons. They test them on cows. They're studying aliens, if you ask me. And I ain't talking about no Mexicans neither. Nobody goes out there. Give a hoot. Don't pollute. Mrs. Fletcher? Well, Sheriff Sunrise. What are you looking for? Well, a Fallugia paradoxa. What's that? Well, it's a little white flower. Actually, the common name is Apache Plume. I don't know it. Maybe because I'm Navajo. Well, it's extremely drought-tolerant. When the guys down at the diner told me that there was some nutsy lady going out in the desert on foot, I didn't believe it. (CHUCKLING) I'm not so nutsy. Well, there's no argument there, but you're about ready to enter a restricted government area. Bad idea. Let me give you a ride. What is in there? I don't ask and they don't tell. I'll never forgive you for that. (CHUCKLING) Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. How you doing, Joe? (HONKING) JOE: Hi, Mrs. Fletcher! Jessica! Yoo-hoo! Oh! Thanks for the ride. Hmm. What a surprise! Hi! We're on our way up to Sedona. Jack's such a romantic. It's our 20th anniversary tomorrow, and we're staying at the mud baths. They're hot springs, dear. Private tubs. MILLIE: Oh, Jessica. Are you okay? We heard you couldn't find your friend, Sarah. Oh, yes. I just stopped off here to study some of the local wildflowers before my lecture in El Paso on Saturday. You're giving a lecture? Er, yes. At Windham College. Oh, Jack, we gotta go hear Jessica! Now, Millie, who said we were invited? It's open to the public, right? Well, yeah... And don't you like to see a friendly face or two in the crowd, Jessica? (CHUCKLING) See, Jack. All rightee, then, Saturday. See you there. Bye. (SIGHING) Think before you speak, Jessica. Good heavens! (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Jessica, what the hell have you gotten into? It's hard to be sure. The Feds are all over this case like white on rice. Well, that I knew. (SIGHING) All I've managed to get so far is Hayward's DMV record. Born 4-26-46. Current address is 45, Yucca Street, Aqua Verde, Arizona. 45, Yucca Street, Agua Verde? NSA. Sarah! What are you doing here, Mrs. Fletcher? Well, I could ask you the same question. You'd be wasting your breath Ron Guzman, FBI. I'm here on official business. Oh, then you'll be able to show me your search warrant. Hey, if you weren't smart, |wouldn't have followed you here in the first place. Look, I assume that you were assigned to protect Sarah on herjourney. Iwatched you follow her out of the dining car, and then... She disappeared into thin air. And obviously, you haven't found her yet. No. And that doesn't look real good for my future at the Bureau. (SCOFFS) But maybe, if you and me work together, we'll both get what we're after. Aren't you the one who let Sarah down in the first place and nearly got me killed as a result? Do you know where she is, Mrs. Fletcher? (SIGHS) I'm not sure that I'd trust you with that information. If you will excuse me, AgentGuzman" Look, all I'm asking is that you contact me if she turns up. MAN: Yeah. I got you. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Good afternoon. Right this way, ma'am. (EXHALES) (BEEPING) (BEEPING) MAN: Come with me! If you still think that I'm Sarah McLeish, you're mistaken. Now, maybe you can tell me what you wanted on that train. Save it for the section chief, lady. Who's that? WILDER: Get this to SIGINT in Washington immediately. Yes, sir. Mr. Wilder. Yes, Radley, what is it? The intruder, sir. Mrs. Fletcher, I am not going to apologize for the way that you were just treated. This facility is classified top... You did exactly what I expected. What? I wanted to find out who was in charge here. You. But, of course, I hadn't realized that we had already met. I have no doubt that had I called for an appointment, I would still be sitting in my hotel room until the end of the millennium. Let's talk. What do you want? I want to know why Peter Hayward was going to the press, and what is going on here at the NSA. I don't know. Judging from what I've learned, this is a communications station. We simply download information from satellites, we pass it on to the appropriate agencies. Including spy satellite data for the Pentagon, right? I'm not allowed to confirm that. You know, Mrs. Fletcher, maybe you can help us. Hayward was one of our top infosec analysts. Oh, which in English means? Information systems security. That's what the NSA does. We protect all U.S. classified communications. Hayward was a cryptographer going through a very messy divorce. Mentally, a little erratic. What exactly did he steal? Well, who told you anything was missing? Radley. When he threatened to kill me on the train if I didn't return it. Mrs. Fletcher, if you have anything of Hayward's, it could be of vital national importance. You would be helping your country by giving it back to us now. Well, given Hayward's expertise, I assume it's some kind of codes that you're missing. It only makes the situation worse if any of this ever gets into the press. And just think of the embarrassment to the NSA. I mean, it's so much simpler, now that both Hayward and his press contact have been silenced. That's not how we operate. Isn't it? Who do you work for? Sarah McLeish. Ha! I knew it. Whom I happened to befriend on the train that evening. You see, by witnessing a murder, she may have been kidnapped or worse, and all you care about is your spy codes. I can assure you, Mr. Wilder, that I will not stop looking for her until I know that she's safe. Now, I would like a ride back to town, please. (DOORKNOB TURNING) Do come in, Mr. Bartles. Where's Sarah McLeish? Perhaps she's staying with her nephew in Florida. The nephew was a cover story for the train ride, just like the name, Judy Taylor. Well, you'll be glad to hear, she was very convincing. Mrs. Fletcher, I am just as concerned as you are about finding your friend. Really? Yes. For some years, the Bureau has been trying, unsuccessfully, to track this organized spy ring that has infiltrated several government agencies. And you believe that Sarah may be able to help? It's possible that Hayward's death may be connected. Now, if that's so, McLeish is the only one alive who can identify any one of them. Your concern for Sarah is touching, but let's make this quick, shall we? As I told Agent Guzman, I don't know where Sarah is. And as I told Mr. Wilder, (SIGHS) I don't have any satellite codes. Yes, the satellite codes. Well, it's been a long day, and I'm about to have a hot, relaxing bath. Is there anything else you want to know before you leave? Yes. Do you know where Agent Guzman is right now? Didn't you send him to Agua Verde? I'll take that as a no. Tell me, how did you find me here if Guzman didn't tell you? Nowadays, Mrs. Fletcher, we're all part of one happy, electronic family. My credit card. That's it! (PHONE RINGING) Is that you, J.B.? She never made it. What'? Your friend. Oh, right! Well, it gives me more time to work on my book. I knew you were doing a story. Dottie, I need a little help with my research. My pleasure. What do you need? Riverbank flowers. BARTLES: Have you ever heard of interagency cooperation? It looks like you're trying to make me look stupid. RADLEY: We are trying to mount a retrieval... Shut him up, Wilder, now! Now, let me get this straight. One of your top guys turns up dead, and you forget to tell us that he's run off with a bunch of codes that are still missing. And I have to find this out from a civilian who you can't help spilling your guts to. I thought we could get the codes back before it became public knowledge. Please. Before Washington finds out, you mean. So you send your mickey mouse head of security over here to get 'em back, and he kills Hayward. Hey! I didn't kill him! When I wanna talk to you, I will look at you. But, you know, for once I believe you. Because that would've been the smart thing to do and you'd have your codes back. But, no! Now we have a killer on the loose who's probably out there right now trying to sell off whatever it was Hayward stole. Now, what kind of value do these codes have on the open market? I think... I think $10 million minimum. What the hell could be worth all that? Encryption data for every single U.S. military satellite. It falls into the wrong hands... Not exactly the Mississippi but it's the only creek near Mount Palmer. Well, thanks for the ride, Dottie. I'll be back around midday. Great. Thanks. Jessica? Oh, thank God you're here. Oh, I've been so frightened. It'll be okay. Sarah, you weren't just a witness to Peter Hayward's murder, were you? He was the lover that you told me about, wasn't he? Oh, Jessica, you have no idea how much I wanted to tell you the truth on the train. I... I saw him lying there. There was blood everywhere. (SNIFFLING) And that man. I was afraid he was gonna kill me. Sarah, listen to me. If you want me to help you, you'd better start at the beginning. Now, Peter had gone to meet Richard Loomis? Yeah. He told me to... To wait at the hotel while he went to the meeting, but Loomis called the room and said he'd been delayed in traffic. So, I went to tell Peter to wait. And just as I got there, I heard the shot. Oh, Sarah. (sums) I'm sorry. It's all right. The killer was standing over Peter when I saw him. Oh! Why didn't you tell the FBI that you knew Peter? Well, I was afraid the NSA was behind this. Oh. You better tell me what Peter was going to tell Loomis, and why he stole the codes. Who said that? Kevin Wilder. Oh, Peter's idiot boss! That's a lie, Jessica! Peter was the best analyst the NSA ever had. A genius. I don't really understand how it works, but Peter told me that he found a flaw in our satellite codes, and he was worried that another government might find out, or terrorists, and have access to all of our classified information. And Wilder knows this? Peter told him months ago. He said it was too expensive to reprogram all the satellites. He said he should just be quiet about it. So Peter decided to go public. Yes. He went to the Pentagon first but theythought he was just a troublemaker. So Peter made a copy of the codes to show Loomis exactly what the problem is. He wasn't going to give them to him. It was just... Just a demonstration, he said. Someone who knew about the codes wanted to stop Peter before he got to Loomis. Yes. I saw him again, Jessica. On the train. The man who killed Peter. That's why I got off. Mrs. McLeish! I know you're in there. I just wanna put you back under our protection. JESSICA: That's Agent Guzman of the FBI. But that's him, Jessica. That's the man who killed Peter. Is that your car outside? Yeah. Let's go. I'm coming in, Mrs. McLeish. Just take it easy. Damn! You're sure he's with the FBI? Yeah. He's out of the Los Angeles Field Office. His boss, Special Agent Bartles, confirmed it last night. Then the government is behind this. Not necessarily. They wanted to shut Peter up. And now, they're after me. I think that Guzman is acting without FBI authorization, judging from what Bartles said. It doesn't make him any less deadly. No, but if we could get to the right people with the right information, that Guzman killed Peter, you'd be safe. We don't know who to trust! Well, I do. When we met, I was going to meet my friend, Cyrus Davis. He used to work for thejustice department. I think he can help us. If we could just get to El Paso... That's easier said than done. Take... Take a left! Are you crazy? Trust me. Mujeres! Agent Bartles. Got a minute? Not unless you can tell me where to find McLeish. I might. I'm listening. I want you to know that I advised Wilder against us acting on our own. Sounds like the old El Salvador all over again. What're you talking about? Our friend, Radley here, worked for the CIA. When a death squad he organized killed three nuns, including a U.S. citizen. Is that right? I didn't order the hits, and I advised against our involvement with right wing extremists. That's not how Washington saw it. They fired him. I took the fall for someone else. And you wanna make sure that doesn't happen again. Is that it? You're pretty smart. For FBI. You know, Radley, you need to work on your people skills. All right. Hayward's bank account showed a monthly payment to a guy up in Phoenix. I just talked to this guy this morning. Hayward was renting a cabin from him, up near Mount Palmer. I'll check it out. Yeah, you do that. Oh, if Wilder asks, we never talked. Hmm. |wouldn't trust him, sir. Oh, I don't. But we can use him before we hang him out to dry. Hi, there. Two coffees to go, please. Right away. Do you know what happened to Hannibal? He crossed the Alps? No, my dog. He was on the train. Oh, yes. We met in the baggage car. He was still there when I left the train. Oh, I hope the FBI is taking good care of him. If you don't mind my saying so, Sarah, I'm glad I don't have that job. Oh, I know, but he's such a lamb with me. And he got that way with Peter, too. Oh, thanks. I'll take care of this. Oh. I forgot, I can't. Oh! No problem. No problem. Do you still have my purse, Jessica? Oh, yes. Everything went on to Cyrus. Oh, good, 'cause I've got some things in there for Charlie. Charlie? Oh, my sister's boy. Oh, yes. Yes, I remember. I think I'd better try Cyrus again before we head on. Uh, will you take care of this? Sure. Thanks. Here you go. CASHIER: Thanks. Cyrus? It's Jessica. Oh, thank goodness you're in. No! No, I'm not going to miss the lecture. I'll be at your house in an hour. Really. Listen, I'm going to need your help. Did you reach him? We're all set. I just need to use the restroom before we go. Okay. We'll get back to you with any further developments. Right. Update. The hotel owner said she dropped Fletcher off this morning near Mount Palmer. Apparently, she was looking for flowers. Yeah, right. What about the cabin? Agent Elston just called in. Someone's been staying there. McLeish? He's not sure but there's two sets of recent tire prints. Call the DMV, get a description of her vehicle. Sh? Yeah? We just got a trace on a call from Mrs. Fletcher. She's at a truck stop about 50 miles from here. They're moving. Timeto call in the local police. Oh, no. Now, wait a minute. You got a problem with that? Yeah. You want every cop from Texas to California to know about this? I thought we were gonna keep it from going public. Look, Wilder, we don't have a problem. I've got a problem and I'm going to deal with it the best way I know how. Put an APB out on McLeish's vehicle. Yes, sir. Excuse me. Engine trouble? No, just a little insurance. Thanks, pal! DRIVER: No problem! (BEEPING) El Paso. (WOMAN TALKING OVER RADIO) (COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC PLAYING) You like country western music? Oh, when in Rome. That's a confirmation. I'm now following suspect vehicle headed east on Route 9 near Columbus. Please advise. Back off! And wait till we get there. Do not intercept. Let's go. (SIGHS) You better see this. This is David Soames, coming to you live from Channel 5's Eye In The Sky newscopter. Highway patrol is now in a pursuit of a white Jeep Cherokee, headed toward El Paso on Route 9. The police are refusing to say what crime has been committed, but we've just heard that the FBI has joined the chase. Stay tuned to Channel 5 for developments in this late-breaking story. (PHONE RINGING) Rad ley. Yes. He's right here. It's the director. Foryou. Hey, Ken, how's it going? MAN ON RADIO: Local highway patrol have been tailing the vehicle for half an hour. We've just learned that an FBI helicopter is now on the scene. Again, state and federal lawmen are closing in on two suspects driving a white Jeep Cherokee as they head towards El Paso. Authorities are remaining tight-Upped about the incident. Okay! Pull 'em over! Yes, sir! (SIRENS WAILING) Let's go. Get out of the vehicle. Now! (WOMAN CHATTERING IN CANTONESE) Come on, guys, let's go. (ARGUING IN CANTONESE) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Excuse me, sir. Are you the agent in charge here? There they are! Oh, it looks like they pulled over the wrong jeep. I wonder if it's because they've got your license plate. Ha! For once that insurance paid off. (BOTH LAUGHING) What we have here is an apparent case of mistaken identity by the highway patrol. These people are not the target of any FBI investigation. Cyrus said that he had a class but he should be home soon. You want some tea? Sure. Um, do you know where our stuff is? Oh, in the spare room down there. (GUN COCKING) (DISTANT SIRENS) (CLATTERING) (GASPING) Agent Guzman! You gave me a shock. Where's the McLeish woman? (GRUNTING) Jessica, are you all right? Yes, I am now. What are we gonna do with him? Nothing. You see, I paged him to come here. Because he killed Peter? I didn't kill anyone. You can't believe him. I'm sorry but I do, Sarah. Since you killed Peter Hayward yourself. Okay, Mrs. Fletcher. Now, you've led every lawman from here to L.A. on a major wild goose chase. This better be good. You're looking for the murderer of Peter Hayward. There she is. Jessica, after all we've been through, how can you do this to me? I thought you were gonna help me. So did I. But not the way that you intended. But you know what they're going to do to me. I'm gonna end up just like Peter, except they're not gonna be able to find the body. Oh, forget the act, Sarah. It's over. I thought you were in trouble. And all the time, you were simply using me. Wait a minute. You found me at the cabin, remember? Is this leading somewhere, ladies? There was only one thing in Peter's house which identified you. This. And the inscription on the back, "With my darling Sarah," is supposedly written by Peter, but it matches the handwriting on your dining car check. Yes, I wrote that for Peter. As a momento. No! You wrote this and planted it in Peter's house, hoping that I'd remember the discussion we had on the train about the cabin, and go up there. Well, I hope that your novels are more believable than this. You've got to admit, this is pretty slim pickings. Two things gave you away today, Sarah. You talked about your nephew, Charlie, (SCOFFING) as if he really existed. But he was only a cover story for the train journey. Exactly! And that convinced me that Sarah was just befriending me until she could get what she wanted. But something else had been nagging at me for awhile. And I realized the truth when you described how quiet Hannibal is with you. Hannibal? Her dog. It's trained to attack on sight. Definitely the most vicious pet that I've ever seen. It wouldn't hesitate to attack anyone who even thought of harming Sarah. And you told me that it liked Peter just as much as you. So what? So why didn't it attack the murderer you claimed you saw? Because the only shooter the dog wouldn't attack is McLeish, here. No! Sarah wanted those satellite codes at any cost. And once she killed Peter, no one else would know about her elaborate confidence scheme. If you're right, why would she step forward as a witness to her own crime? It was unlucky timing. Sarah intended to kill Peter and steal the codes. But after she shot him, she was disturbed by the passing police car. She covered her escape by not escaping at all. She posed as a terrified witness. Well, let's suppose I buy all this, Mrs. Fletcher. Where are the codes now? Well, they're in her purse. No. I don't even have a purse. You left it in the dining car. Which seemed strange to me at the time. No woman would ever leave her purse behind, unless she meant to. So what's your point? Today she asked me if I still had the purse, but I never told you or anyone else that I'd picked it up in the dining car. How did you know Mrs. Fletcher had it? This is the most ridiculous story. She could only have found that out from someone else who saw me pick it up in the dining car. You didn't leave it by mistake. You left it there to transfer the codes to whomever you're working with. And Sarah must have spoken to that person since she got off the train. Okay, but why in heaven's name would she come back to Agua Verde? Well, to erase any evidence of her relationship with Peter. Whenever she came to see Hayward, they always met up in the cabin, where she wouldn't be seen. Whose idea was it to take the train to Florida? She said she was afraid of flying. So, Sarah conned you into putting her on atrain that she knew went past Agua Verde. So, right from the start, Mata Hari here was using Hayward to get at the codes. How come she latched onto the one guy who'd found a flaw on our satellite codes? Peter had tried to report his findings to the Pentagon. And we know that the spy ring got information out through several times before. And where's this purse now? Well, it's in the safe at the hotel. You could have contacted me directly, Mrs. Fletcher. I did, when I used my calling card. I just didn't know that Sarah was going to switch the license plates. You don't have anything you can take into court. I'm leaving. BARTLES: I don't think so. We're keeping you under protective custody until we can sort this thing out. You were lucky this time, Guzman. But if you want to stay with this agency, you'd better learn to play by the book. Wait a minute. What about Richard Loomis? Sarah was already off the train. So she couldn't possibly have killed him. That was a local murder, Mrs. Fletcher. He didn't work for the NSA. No, but they had to be connected. I mean, chances are that if you find his killer, you're gonna find Sarah's accomplices. You're probably right. But I'm gonna worry about that later. First, I've got to retrieve a 64 gigabyte silicon chip. Come on. Let's go. A silicon chip! Now he tells me. Agent Guzman, it's critical that we get back to Agua Verde as quickly as possible. I... I can't do that without authori... To hell with it. You've been right so far. Now what? Well, the sheriff's son. I think he has the satellite codes. I need to call a lawyer. Now. Joe, I thought you had baseball practice this afternoon? Yeah, I'm just heading down there. Then go before I take that thing away from you. Still busy. How long can it be busy? (GAME BOY BEEPING) Jim? It's Jessica Fletcher. Hi! How you doing? Jim, do you know where little Joe is? He just went down to the park. Why? Well, he may be in some danger. And it's all my fault. Just don't let him, or that electronic game out of your sight. Okay. Where's my boy? Haven't seen him. (HONKING) Joe, you okay? I've been looking all over for you. Why didn't you go to practice? I was just playing one game before I go down to the park. (sum-nus) Oh, thank goodness you found him! Hi, Mrs. Fletcher. Hi, Joe. I'm afraid I'm going to have to have the game back. I promise not to play as much. You do? Only when Dad says. Good, because I've ordered you one with the new game cartridges in it. And it'll be waiting for you at the drugstore. Really? Uh-huh. Well, we're gonna get it later. You're going to the park. Thanks for keeping this safe for me. That's it? GUZMAN: Yeah. Doesn't look like much. Well, we'd better get it back to the NSA. I'll be happy when that happens. This job has been screwy from the start. You're about the only person that didn't have a double Identity. Wait a minute! On the train, Sarah's name was Judy Taylor. So? Well, suppose someone apart from Loomis or the federal authorities called Sarah by her real name. It'd have to be her contact then. It has to be. Which means we know who shot Loomis. We do? I'm gonna need this. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Oh, there she is! Yoo-hoo, Jessica. Break a leg! Jack. That's for the theater, not a lecture. (CHUCKLING) You're right, dear. Cyrus? Jessica. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to introduce today's guest speaker. Now, you all know her as a distinguished author. You may not be as aware of her academic credentials as ateacher of both writing and criminology. My good friend, Jessica Fletcher. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. Thank you, Cyrus. Thank you. I was going to talk to you today about my latest novel, but, instead, I've decided to talk to you about something else. And since every good story deserves a good title, I've decided to call this one, "Murder and How Not to Get Away With It." It's a tale of intrigue and deception, where those who seem the most innocent turn out to be cold-blooded killers. I do hope you'll all be able to stay for the entire plot. It starts with a simple electronic game and an eastbound train.
