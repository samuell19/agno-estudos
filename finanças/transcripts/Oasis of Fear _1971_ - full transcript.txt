And that's why we rang your doorbell for 10 minutes I don't believe you Why were you looking for gasoline? Because we ran out here And besides, we don't have a cent Can't even buy a sandwich We're starving We don't need anything else. I'm sorry OK You can go, I won't call the police Thanks We have enough gas now Then go We won't bother you anymore Thanks Wait! I'm sorry.

He'll be here soon And you're nervous about this? I'm not nervous Stop it Where is your husband? In Livorno. At the NATO base - A military man - A colonel When you first saw us, you thought we were burglars Yes - You changed your mind - What's wrong with that? Nothing You don't agree? Is this an interrogation? I think it's me who should be asking questions Yes, you're right So, what do you want to know? Everything? OK... I will now reveal to you my darkest and most intimate secrets Dick Butler at your service House breaker, bank robber, safe cracker avoider of conventions, mugger, thief, blackmailer and sex maniac Acting in collusion with a certain Ingrid Sjoman, a well-known and cruel Danish serial killer, who turns her victims' bodies into soap If any of that was true you wouldn't have told me But I assume you're in trouble with the police Am I wrong? Well, it's not really trouble More just a difference of opinion and itinerary They wanted us to go north but we preferred the south What do you think? Well? I'd go south I can see that Where's Ingrid? She's taken your car. It's part of our criminal plan Hey, what...? Don't believe everything I say What are you afraid of? Dick's dream was to become a sort of guru, an Indian holy man Pretending to teach me to stand still and to fast But underneath it all, despite appearances, he was still a hung up middle class schoolboy Right? I taught him how to eat... ...how to make love ...how to lose his inhibitions and not to be ashamed if my father opened the bedroom door suddenly while we were in bed My father's very polite, he said sorry and closed the door behind him Show Barbara the Cobra pose It purifies the soul even if it doesn't help the digestion - Does he always obey you? - Of course But I obey him too We're all willing slaves in a way, and you know why? Because slaves can rebel, but their owners can't Did you know the head of the Italian women's liberation movement is a man? Ingrid is a feminist! Watch out, she's wild She's a savage Once she took part in a feminist protest and tried to undress a policeman I pitched in and helped her And she thanked me just like a little puppy I always supported her, saved her from all sorts of troubles What are you talking about? It was those naked pics of me that paid for our trip Oh, so that's why you ran away Who's running away? We're on vacation This is not just a vacation We're on a mission to bring sexual liberation to this country Maybe we'd be more successful if Barbara joined us How about it? Why not. What must I do? This could be the beginning of our revolt against sexual repression Is this your husband? Put that back! Dear me, looks like you don't keep your promises - I'm sorry, but... - Oh, I know... He could come back any time and maybe we're not exactly the sort of guests he'd welcome That's not it... He should be back by now I just don't know what... That'll be him - Hello? - What's going on? I was waiting for you I thought something had happened You OK? Any problems? No, I'm fine I knew about it I had to change plans Now I can't call you tomorrow Yes, don't worry. Bye - Was it him? - No Another man? - So what if it was? - Nothing It's late... - Come on, time to split - Why? We've caused enough trouble I think we should let Barbara go to bed to wait for her husband, like a good wife OK, I'll get changed Who are you calling? I want to see if Steve is still in the office Silly... it's much too late And there's no-one there of course Come here! Listen Barbara says we can stay here tonight She doesn't want to be alone. You fine with that? Oh, it's empty... We'll have to open another one We're out of cigarettes Dick, could you go to the garage? There's cigarettes in the car It's too far Please... In the glove compartment Can't you do without? Come on Dick, be nice I thought you'd have trouble finding the light switch Is that a lighter? - Well - Stop it! - Whose is it? - Steve's. Put it back - Make me - Put it back It's dangerous to play with guns when you're drunk - There's no cigarettes here - I found these in a drawer upstairs - Give me one - Later Now put the gun back in its place Let's go Pigs... It's only ketchup My horoscope said: "Write down what you think about your best friend" - So I did - In very poor taste Aren't you used to her yet? She's very superstitious She believes in magic, witches, horoscopes... - By the way, what's your sign? - Leo I knew it. You have all the features of a Leo Here, listen... This is you "You think you can control difficult situations" "Do not be afraid to ask for wise advice" Whose advice could be more wise than mine? - Come on, ask me - But I have no problems Come on, you must have some little problem I can solve Alright... I have a mad desire to kiss your boyfriend Really? You mean you've not done it yet? I thought that's why you went to the garage Ah, where would you be without me...? Well, come on Dick Kiss her, it's in the stars - Must I? - I told you to Do it. That's an order Stop now! Put her down! I hope this is alright for you Please feel at home There's cigarettes here - You going to say goodnight? - Sure I'll even kiss you goodnight Sleep well Good night What's going on? One minute she's acting crazy and the next she's like a grand lady, talking to us like a pair of kids What's it all about? Dick, she wants to sleep with you Or maybe with you? - Maybe she wants us both - Together or separately? You know, I feel sorry for her I was looking for an aspirin Dick! Where are you? Ingrid, I'm locked out, open the door Come on, Ingrid! Go to hell The police, please Yes, it's urgent Hello...? Hello? You fucking dirty bitch! Here, this is yours! You think you had to pay me for it? Wrong, darling What were you going to tell the police? That we stole your money? I wanted to know about my husband Really? So why did you lock me in? And something else... You cleaned up all traces of our little party Ingrid... This is incredible... Look at her dress Look what she's done Was that to explain what happened last night? "M right, yes? Like I said, I wasn't calling the police about you Really? Call them again now and ask them about your husband - You forced me to sleep with you - You were gagging for it - Try something more convincing - Get out OK, we're off But we have to stop you playing games with the phone So right now... that's what we're going to do If you touch me, I'll scream And you'd like that Don't worry. I've no desire to touch you Scream all you want. No one will hear you anyway - When my husband arrives... - When your husband arrives... he'll keep his mouth shut if he doesn't want everyone to know his wife is crazy So come on. Get moving Dick All quiet outside, it's a good time to go I see no other solution after the game she was playing I'll go, you stay here with her and be very careful If I can do everything in a couple of hours we'll be fine After that she won't want to call the police In fact she'll have to keep her mouth shut unless something else is going on I'd like to know what she's thinking Anyway, we need a little money or it's not going to be easy Get it off her. 10,000 lire should be enough After all, she expected thieves, right? Where's Dick? Where did he go? - Sit quietly - Let me explain, trust me I'm not interested If you only knew - my life's a disaster - I bet it is My husband... We had a terrible quarrel the other night It was horrible, disgusting He hit me He hurt me He acted crazy That's your problem I'm afraid of him I'm just terrified He's unpredictable That's why I wanted you to stay here yesterday I felt safe with you This morning I decided to call the police I locked you in... because because I I just can't... I wanted to get away from him What about the money... in Dick's pocket? That was just an accident. Money means nothing to me - For me it's just - A way to pay debts? Take it if you want. You told me you had no money I can't face my husband again. It's too humiliating Please try to help me Why should I? Oh my God Make it go away Two cans of black paint and two brushes Quickly please Agostin0's in town! Holy Mary! Are you as crazy as me? What's up? I just want my 3O thousand lire Very funny No jokes. I just need my money Alright, 15,000 for me, 15,000 for you I don't see why You want me to be like everyone else? I thought you were a folk hero Heroes have to eat too OK, Robin Hood, half and half Take it and stay well Hey, asshole! Just don't tell anyone. Don't want to harm our reputation Hey! Come see us in Naples... Finished the report? - Did you see anything? - No, nothing at all It was all over by the time I arrived Anyway, if you need me here's my card I'm a lawyer and I've got a meeting with a client Thank you It was a gray car with foreign plates - Could you identify it? - I think so Hey, you! Come here See'? This makes your eyes look bigger What a beautiful face you have. So fresh Wait... Try this on Go on, try it It's yours. My gift It suits you more than me, take it But I guess Dick won't like it Why don't we leave together? Just you and me Get your hands off me! I don't want your damned fur Here "Why don't we leave together" Think I'm stupid? Now sit down there... and behave And keep your mouth shut, OK?

Locked The plates are screwed on They're fixed on the inside We need something thin Hold on Try this Her husband... And... I don't believe it Look, it's my belt Now I get it... She called the police to blame the killing on us She thought it all through, down to the smallest detail We'll have to call the police Tell them everything - No... - What is it? The gun What gun? Last night when she asked me to come here for cigarettes It's not there Yesterday there was a gun and I held it in my hand Could you come down? What's going on? We want to say goodbye After you That was my belt It was you You killed him! He left and then you arrived, pretending to look for gas You won't get away with it The police are already after you for selling pornography Murderers! Enough! Just shut up and stay there How were you going to get rid of him? Throw the body off a cliff? No, that was too risky, right? That's why you were so nervous Then we arrived. Two lambs to the slaughter And you decide to take advantage and put us in your place Where's the gun? Yes, sweetie, the gun With my fingerprints, that should be yours! Perfect, eh'? So where have you hidden it? Where's the gun?? Anyone there? Colonel? Mrs. Slesar? Are you deaf? I'm sorry, I was asleep Where's Colonel Slesar? He's not here. He's in Pisa with his wife They went with friends Where in Pisa? I don't know When are they back? They didn't say Who are you? I'm just a guest, An au pair for a few months Right Excuse me We would like to see everything here Carry on There was an accident on the coastal road near our base A big American style car hit a child Then drove off We're checking all such cars, OK? Standard procedure There's no scratches on the car, sir Have a close look, there's no hurry I'll take that Oh my God...! Help me - Are you alright, miss? - I can't breathe... take me outside Thanks Take deep breaths I'm better now. It was the heat. I'm pregnant - Feeling better? - Yes, thanks When the Colonel gets back can you ask him to call me? I hope we will meet again in happier circumstances ls the sports car yours? Yes You've got a broken tail light that needs fixing See you later, I hope Over there - What if they come back? - It won't be for a while Let's just go This whole thing makes me feel sick Sure, but first we have to repaint the car And find that damn gun with my prints Or we'll have real problems, you get me? Well...? We're waiting You going to tell us? Where's that gun? What have you done with it? I don't know where it is. I don't have it Really? So it vanished by itself? - So, tell me, one last time - Anyone could have taken it Who, for example? Me? Not you, but Ingrid could have taken it Maybe while we were in bed Filthy bitch! Go on, don't stop now Keep on making things worse She's right If you leave marks, they'll believe her lies Right, how about this... You tell us where the gun is and we'll just go We'll disappear and it'll be like we were never here OK, so you don't trust us Or maybe for you it's too late But not for us Give me a cigarette Light it Ingrid, get out Damn it! I know I'm an idiot but I can't do it What a night I'll go crazy if we don't get out of here I'll finish this Go and check how she is Give her some sleeping pills You decide how many, but just so she's out for a while We'll need some time Dick! Dick! Stop her! She's getting away! Faster, Dick! - We must catch her! - Quick, go check the gates You'll get new clothes in prison Which do you prefer, mini, midi or maxi? Mrs Slesar? Colonel? - Shall I turn off the light? - Wait Turn them all on, quickly Troll! And no tricks... Come on Answer him and say goodbye And watch what you say - Ah, you're there - What is it, Pietro? I walked past and saw the lights - I thought you were going away - I changed my mind Ah, OK I heard some noises in the aviary, like someone was in there - No-one was there - I could go check if you want No, you can go home Do you need anything? No thanks, I don't need anything - Good night - Good night I'm fine, don't worry "What's happened. Stop" "Unable to reach you. Stop" "Call me." No signature Must be the same guy who called yesterday He must be involved too - There - Why are you burning it? - Answer me - So it can't be used against us Dick, I want to scream I can't take much more, we're trapped At any time someone could come and find... what's in the oar There's only one thing to do You agree? Troll, good boy What is it? Still taking on the owls, huh? Let's go Come along - Listen, maybe she buried it - Buried what? The gun Are you kidding? That's the last thing she'd do Why'd she bury it with my prints on it? I guess so But she's hidden it somewhere, where it's easy to find But where? That's just what we don't know: where Come, let's hurry Dick, I think I've got it! Look, I was right! Don't worry, it'll grow back Let's go Troll! Colonel! Colonel Slesar, are you back? - Carry on - I felt something was wrong Like there was someone in the villa They threatened me with a gun Troll was very nervous. Obviously he smelled the body It was the dog led us where the corpse was buried I couldn't sleep last night, and came back to the villa at dawn Seeing them leave in the sports car, I realized something was going on When I found the poor lady I thought she was dead... All those sleeping pills Inspector... - Where were they? - The keys were in the pool but these were on the garage floor That's her. I recognise her She had me fooled They thought of everything, even the lady's fingerprints on the gun Nice kids, eh? On Friday morning Mrs Slesar came to my office She needed advice... about an adoption To adopt a child I explained all the legal issues so she could talk to her husband While this was just her idea, she wanted to find out more But I was sure the colonel would have been fine with it As you know, they did not have children I drove her home, but unfortunately did not go inside the house I can only imagine if I had... How did you get on with your husband? Steve loved me. We were very happy together - Does he have close relatives? - No So you are his only heir? I've no idea I never dreamed that Steve would... I'm sorry but I have to ask how your husband was killed It was horrible Horrible Mr. Baratti dropped me off at the gate I was home, I was in a hurry I wanted to talk to Steve about the adoption The garage door was open which was unusual I had a premonition I just had time to enter, when... Steve was lying on the ground covered in blood The boy was still holding the gun in his hand I started to scream, but... I must have passed out When I came to it seemed like many years had passed They tied me up and gagged me They started drinking, here in this room They unplugged the phone That's right I tried to call here but no one answered me - Mrs Slesar... - Yes? Why do you think these people killed your husband? Perhaps they thought the house was empty and planned a robbery Then found Steve ls something missing? Money for example? About 300 thousand lire. It was here in a drawer It was horrible It was a nightmare that lasted for hours Unbearable I'm sorry, but it's important that you tell us everything He forced me... He raped me... Look at that sea - Let's got for a swim - Are you crazy? Why not? It's hot and we're tired. It'll do us good It's too risky. We've still a long way to go Come on, nobody's looking for us No-one's interested in us I bet she's still sleeping. We have loads of time - You're really crazy - Please... You cleaned that damned villa up like we'd never been there Do it for me I've a mad desire to swim and then make love Catch up! Try to catch me! Your papers, please Thanks Look at this Patrol number three... Those two with the sports car, wanted for murder... Poor thing What'll she do when she wakes up? You still feel sorry for her? She deserves a good lesson Get dressed All I want now is to cross that border as soon as possible ...the murder committed for the purpose of robbery 400,000 lire were taken from the villa of Mrs Slesar The police are looking for the two young people... Put some music on, my love No, let's not. We can talk, or enjoy the silence You know, there's something I never told you Which is? I'd be an idiot to ever leave you I love you Police! Faster! Look out!
