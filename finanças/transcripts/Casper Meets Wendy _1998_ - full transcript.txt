Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ah, ha ha ha! Yee-ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Wowee, that ball is... out of here! A grand slam! Yeah! Unbelievable! In your face! Yowza! Yowza! Yowza! Show me something to top that! Did you see that? Wow. They're back. Quick, give me the camera. Oh, yeah. Your mother's never gonna believe this. Greetings, Earthling. Can you direct me to the Roswell Chili Cookoff? 'Cause I'm a little low on gas! Ha ha ha ha! - Aah! - Aah! Ha ha ha! Yaaa ha ha ha! Wide load comin' through. Run for your lives! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ohh... Ohhhh! Get away from me! Hey, batboy. Strike one. Strike two. 3, 4, 5, 6! You're out! It looks like your bat's been to spring training. Ha ha ha! Aah! Hey, ain't it time for the seventh inning stretch? Aaahhhh! Aaahhh! Aah! It's raining dogs and dogs. Bombs away. Ha ha ha! Chill, folks. You don't have to be scared. See, I'm Casper, the Friendly... - Ghost! - Ghost! -Ghost! - Aah! - Aah! -Aah! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Boys,we done good. I think it's time we had a long rest. Rest? You mean, like "in peace"? No! In the Catskills. Ooh, a vacation? Certainly Show me three ghosts who deserve it more. Uh, you mean four, right? Oh, right, of course, short-sheet. Can't leave you out. Otherwise, who'd carry our luggage? - Ha ha ha. - Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha, very funny. You've reached the home of Desmond Spellman. Hi, I'm calling from the International Children's Fund, and we're asking generous people like you to donate any -- Aah! Ooh! Ooh! Oracle of the Mirror, show yourself. You summoned? Ha ha ha! Don't take that tone with me. You're a slave of the mirror, and the mirror belongs to the greatest witch of all -- Moi. Yes, Master Command me as you will. Very well. Give me the stock quotes, the, uh, weather, and the witch rankings. Here is your news. The skies are blue, the Dow Industrials are up by two, you've been the greatest for year after year, but as of today you have something to fear. Haha! What? Who could be greater than Desmond Spellman? Wendy --Ooh-- the good little witch. Good witch? There's no such animal. It is true, all the same, on this you can bank. Unless you act now, you will forfeit your rank. She's just a little child. What's so dangerous about her? Humble, yes, but in exile, she'll change, thanks to the help of an ally most strange. If witches and spirits unite as friends, she will be the greatest, and your power will end. Don't try to scare me, you cheap antique. Just, uh... tell me how to get rid of this little mall rat. There's no adios to compare with this -- behold! The dreaded Mystic Abyss. Human or witch or creature not mortal, all will be lost when they step through this portal Hahaha! Perfect. Ahhh... Ah. Ahhh. Hey, you're lookin' good, Jules. Back at ya. I want you to go to this address and bring me this brat. She's living in the country with her aunts. Ah, must bean aunt farm. Ha ha ha! I don't want any slip ups. You think you can handle this? No sweat. Mornings would be better if they happened in the afternoon. Oh,yeah. He's coming. Where did I put it? Ch, right. Thanks. Yes. Yikes, my pajamas! Uh, Wendy's outside. Don't bother me now. Just keep watching. OK, OK. I'm the original Spice Girl. Did you put in enough belladonna? Speaking of belladonna, I once knew one. A Donna, that is. She had two kids, so I guess that makes her a "Ma, Donna." You get it? Madonna? Ooh, all right, I'll shut up. Fanny, status report. Shh! I'm looking for the paperboy. Well? Well what? Is he coming? Who? The paperboy! Good idea. Gert, I'm gonna go look for him right now. Ohh, God! What did I do to deserve sisters like this? Well, let's see. You invented mildew, morning breath... foot fungus. Ha ha ha. Hi. Hi. Ahoy, the paperboy. OK, let's get going. Thanks. Oh! Hee hee hee! Aah!Aaaaahhhh! Aah! Stop it, stop it! Help me! Aaahhhh! Aaahhhh! Hey, how do you like them rotten apples? Aah! Go away! Now, that's "Hard Copy." Weirdos. You’re all weirdos. How could you do that?! No wonder I don't have any friends. Oh, really? Well, I don't like the way he flings our paper. Then just tell him. Please, talk to the hand, because the witches ain't listening. But -- Wendy-poo, wake up and smell the potion. I mean, we're witches, for goodness'' sake. We don't explain. We get even. You mean, like this? Little smarty-bloomers, eh? Makes you love me all the more, huh? We don’t have to love ya. We’re family. Yeah,we're stuck with ya. [Vincent] Not to worry, ladies. We’re gonna take her off your hands. Butt out, Bozo, before I turn you into a newt. Aww, and here I thought Desmond Spellman told me that you was gonna be so cooperative. Ohhh... D-D-D-- De-Desmond Spellman? Do I look like a speech therapist to you? Then why are you stammering? Leave her alone,you big goon! Ahh! I'll take Mouthy Little Witches for 500. And you hit the Daily Double. - Aah! - Ohh! Yaaah! - Aah! - Aah! -Aah! Aaahhh! Aah!Aah! Ohh, now, run, come on! Hurry up! We got ya now, kid. Oh! Gosh,where are my manners? Let me make you feel right at home. Of all the witches in the world, we had to get one with a sense of humor. Hurry up! Uh-oh. Someone's been working out. Get your things and let's go. Let's go. Get your broom. Hey you, come back here! Oh, yeah, let's not and say we did. I almost got her. Whew! Well, I got us out of that one, girls. You?! Why are those guys after Wendy? Ask her. I don't even know who they are. You heard them. They were sent by Desmond Spellman. Who's he? He's trouble, and you got us into it. Yeah, Wendy and it's all your fault. Thanks a heap. Wow, check it out. Man, this place has everything but my reservation. Ahhh, I feel my ectoplasm relaxin' already. This is gonna be some vacation. They must've thought I was a pack mule in another life. Quit dawdling, Bulb Head. Oh, Honeycakes, this is gonna be just so ab-fab. Only the best for the Bradshaws. Ohhh. Hey, this cabin looks nice. Yeah, and it's empty, too. Ohh. Hey, knock it off, you guys. There's already someone here. Where? I don't see anyone. Do you? - Aah! - Aah! - Aah! - Aah! Thanks for your hospitality. See ya! Ha ha ha! - Ghosts! - Ghosts! Hahaha! Boy, I can't believe you guys. Do you have something to share, young Casper? Pray, do tell us. I just thought m-maybe you could -- Heh -- try to be a little more... you know, friendly. Good advice, Casper. I thinkl speak for all of us when I say... drop dead! The only good fleshie is a scared fleshie. But why do you scare them? 'Cause they can't scare back. Except for witches. Oohhhh! What's wrong with witches? Wake up and smell the coffin. Witches are fleshies with power. Yeah. Oooh. Now go unpack the stuff, Washcloth. Jeez Louise. Whata bunch of grumps. Ahhh, this is the afterlife. Witches! - Aah! - Aah! -Aah! Hello, everybody, I'm Larry Tollby. I'm the social director here at Sunny Brite. How ya doin'? OK, great. Hey, did you hear the one about the roof? It's over your head. Hey, look out, Robin Hood. Archery 2:00. Were we followed? No, I think we're safe. Are you sure this is a good place to hide? Desmond will never find us in this place. Oh, ladies. Larry the Legend. No, thank you. Do you see? This place, this dump is disgustingly cheery. I mean, we're miles from nowhere. We're definitely all gonna blend in. Yeah. Aren't you ladies a little old to be Trick-or-Treating? Excuse me? If it weren't for those hats, you'd be totally pointless. Ibbity... Bibbity... Fibbity-- Stop! We're in hiding, remember? Ohh. Witches. Yo! Hi, Sugar. Cabin for four. Maybe with a spare room in case I want to entertain some guests. I'm very sorry, ladies, but I just gave my last cabin to that woman. What, you mean, you don't have any more vagrancies-- I mean, vagran-vagran- vacan-vancan -- You don't have any rooms here? Not unless that woman decides to move out. Aunt Gert, don't -- don't you dare. I've haaad a chaaange of mind Good-bye. We're not goatish. Bellbag, uh... Bellboy please. The bags to the top of the stairs. You know, girls, I think that old bag was right. We definitely don't blend in. Huh. Wardrobe change. I be witchin'! That out fit, you stick out like a sore thumb. Let's get inside. Hold up. Wait, wait. Hi, I'm Josh. You've probably heard of me. I'm Wendy. When'd you get here? About a week ago. Do you like it? Kinda boring. Until now. Now, listen, Niece. Desmond Spellman is after you. For some reason, we're caught up in this. Now, I don't want you talking to anybody until we figure out how to get out of this jam. Mmm. Jam. Mmm. But why are we running from this Desmond guy? Why don't we just all go confront him? Better to confront a nuclear missile. Now, listen, missy. This guy is trouble, and he's after us. No, Mirror Boy I'm not going to let some teen spell slinger upstage me. Tell me again about the hash part. It's minced corned beef and potatoes. You mix'em together, see? And then you cook it till it's nice -- Where have you been? Uh, well, this diner had a breakfast special, see, and -- Where is Wendy? Uh,she gave us the slip. Great. I'm going to have to go to plan "B." Whoa. Observe. Now, if those witless witches use any high-level magic, this little gizmo will pinpoint their location. Now, watch. What kind of potatoes? Well, usually you use the russets. Watch! Smells like something died around here. I thought you'd never notice. Aah! That wasn't very nice. Thanks! Now hold this whilst I load you up with delectables. Great. Check out Casper, the phantom food felon. You want some cheese with that whine? Just clam up and carry the food, Bulb Head. Unh. It's too dang cheery in here. Yes, these floral prints are just killing my sinuses. Let's fix this place up. You gonna help, little Miss Goody-Two-Spells, or you just gonna type all day? I know, you cast the spells, and I'll run them through my spell checker! Ha ha. Get it? Spell checker. Hardy-har-har. For your information, I'm looking up Desmond Spellman on the Internet. Maybe, just maybe, I can find some answers. Well, check out my new website. Ooh, that's great! That's great! So are we going to redecorate or what? All right. Witches one... Witches all... Zippity-zappity, let's get that wall. Good, good. Now let's get that wall. All right. Now the back. Excellent. Wonderful. Great. Let's see, uh... Check it out! What? Yes! It's them! Quickly, write down the coordinates. Sorry. Wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey! What?! Stop it! Stop it! Aah! What? No! No, no! Come back! You...come...back! Shh! All right. I think we're safe. Right. Not if you're on the bottom. Yeah, what's the big idea? Big magic sends big static! You mean Desmond could have found us? Faster than a Lo-Jack. Now, from now on, we all have to be very, very careful. But I can't even tie my own shoelaces without magic, or do my algebra, or-or brush my teeth, or play the glockenspiel. Relax, all right. We can still do little stuff -- pranks, rashes -- we just can't do the big stuff anymore. Well, wait a minute. If we have to quit, so does she! Hey! Right, no more wand-y Wendy Give it over, come on. Cough it up. Come on. Fine. I'm wand-free. This is much too powerful for you. Good. Now, I think that we should go out and do a little scouting, in case Desmond sent some of his spies. We'll start at the pool. OK. The pool! I'll get my swimsuit! No way, Red. You're not taking one step outside this cabin. Yeah! If Desmond finds you, he'll turn us all into pumpkin guts. Yes, and don't trust anyone. Man, I'm starting to feel like I'm in the Witches' Protection Program. You got it, squirt. Now stay! Hey, Fatso! Stretch! Wake up. We broughta snack. Aah. Snack! I'm there. Yeah, I'm starvin' to death... in a manner of speaking. Oh, yumbo! It's delightful. It's deluxe. It's the last you'll see of it! Uncle Fatso, what happened? Yeah, you look like a hot air balloon! Huh? Aah! A sun burn! Ehh, don't sweat it. We'll bleach you out after lunch. Now, let's eat. Wait. No napkins. Favorite Nephew, will you dothe honors? You scarfed everything. No, no, no, no, no, no. We left the wrappers. You three always do this. Do what? Huh? Ah, well...I mean, uh... Nevermind. Gee, I thinkwe hurt his feelings. Man,whycan't I stand up tothoseguys? This vacation stinks. It isn't fair. It isn'tfair. Yo, Josh, catch. Hey, man, what's up? Josh! Josh! Hi there. Too bad! You lose! Crud! Thanks for messin' me up. Oh, hi. Got a quarter? Sorry. No problem. Hey, jerk. This is my game! Excuse me. Quit it! Hey, that wasn't very nice. Watch me wipe out these commanders! Yeah, nuke'em, wax'em, fry'em! Josh, uh... I really needed to talk to someone and I thought -- Eat hot laser, you wimps. And I thought maybe you could -- Can't you see I'm going for a high score? Yeah, take a hike. You jerks. Hey! Aah! I just wanted someone to talk to! Join the club. A ghost! Don't you come any closer, you! No, no, wait! I won't hurt you. I'm warning you, I've got a wand, and I'm not afraid to use it. Aah! A witch! A witch! Ah... Are-Are you really a-a w-w-witch? Yeah. What of it? Nothing. I just didn't know witches were so... Cute. You think so? Well, you're a ghost. I was always told ghosts were... spooky and mean, you know? Most of us are, I guess. But not me! In fact, I'm friendly. My aunts say, "Never trust what you can't see." But you can see me. And I certainly can see you. I'm Wendy. I'm Casper. Can you sit? Abso-spookin'-lutely. Do you have, like, horrific, ghostly super powers? Brace yourself... for terror! And what about you? Can you really do magic like David Copperfield? Are you kidding? He eats my pixie dust. Watch this. Ah, ha. Will you settle forsomething small? Sure. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, ho, ho. Ha ha. Sweet! I can't believe my uncles are so wrong about witches. There are other ghosts here? Yeah, but all they ever want to do is scare people and boss me around. Tell me about it. My aunts treat me like I'm a nobody. Guess we have a lot in common, huh? So, Wendy wanna do something? Well, I'm sorta grounded, but... let's have some fun! Whoo! Yeah! Casper, come on. Aah, aah, ooh! Cannonball! Ohh! It's Desmond! Help! I'm melting! No, you're not. Oh, I'm not. I guess I'm not. Well... Having a bad airday? Casper? Yeah? I know this is gonna sound really lame and all, but... Whoa! This has been the best day of my life. Me, too. Well, except for the life part. It doesn't make any sense! I have no friends, none. And my family treats me like I'm sludge. I hear that. And then you come along, and I finally feel like I'm somebody. But I'm supposed to hate you. Ch, it doesn't make any sense. But we still are friends, right? Wendy, friends doesn't come close to describing how I feel. Wait a second! If my aunts find out I'm friends with a ghost, they'll throw a witchy fit. I won't get to see you anymore. And my uncles say no self-respecting ghost would talk to a nasty, snaggle-toothed, wart-ridden, hagged out -- Hey! Oh, sorry. So what do we do? Hmm. If we just got them together somehow, I just know that they'd get along. Sure, Wen, that'd work. All we have to do is turn your aunts into ghosts, or my uncles into humans. And I know just the way! Hey, hey, everybody! How's it going? Guess what time it is. It's limbo time! Now, remember only you can put the "Brite" in Sunny Brite. I'm going for a record here. Ha. Right here. Who thinks they can beat this? Beat him? My pleasure. Awk-akk! Awk-akk! Aah. Oh, cabana boy! Can we have three more big ones over here, please? Sure. Just a second. Would you like anything, honey? Yes, the cabana boy. Oh! Ha! Ch, oh, and cabin boy can you bring us back some of those nice, um, low-fat pretzels? In fact, bring us a whole case. Yeah! A drink, please. Here you are. My chair. I'm thinking I'd like it much higher. Your chair? Aah! Massage here? Oh, fabulous. A towel, please. Take off my shoes. And while you're at it, find me some nail polish. I want you to do my toes. I'll be right back. Madam! Hey, sugar-shorts, how about a date? Uh, December 7th, 1941. Yeah. I just love when they play hard to get. I win. Rock smashes paper. No, rock smashes scissors. When did they change the rules? It's always been that way, Potato Head. Anyways, paper covers rock. So I win. What are you two idiots doing? Come and watch the radar. Listen to me. Psst! Psst! Hey, did I spring a leak or something? You all call this scouting for danger? Yeah, dangerous Desmond. Hmm. Wendy! What are you doing here? Relax. I was really careful. I had to tell you something. What could possibly be so important that you'd risk our safety? There's a dance tonight. Dance? Groovy. The Monkey. The Swim. The Electric Slide. The Funky Chicken. Did somebody say "fried chicken?" No, not chicken. Hey, it could be "hunk city." Oh, color us there. Let's color our little niece Wendy straight back to her room, solving this Desmond mess. Now goon, scoot. Hey, I'll hold onto this. Goon now. Impossible child. Unh. Hey, watch it. Oh, hi, doll face! Bye, dog face! Look, I forgive you about that video game thing. Get a clue. Hey you better be nice or l won't take you to the dance. Horrors! Besides, I met someone else. Good-looking, too. Better than me? Yeah, very pale, no hair, and hangs out in cemeteries. Look, you're going to the dance with me, and that's that. Josh, you are way behind on 90s' dating rituals, and maybe you need to "catch up." Aah! Whoa! Aah! Get off me! What do you think you're doing, you little twerp? Whoa! Enjoy your bath, Joshy. Nobody makes Josh Jackman look like a geek! Hello, Karnak. Have you found her? Damn. Well, then, keep looking. Hello, Samantha. What have you got for me? Oh, too bad. Oh, dang.

Then you've come to the right place, Bulb Head, 'cause we're experts. In fact, we hold the time record for inhabiting fleshies. Yeah, I know. Except... Well...

We gotta find us some fleshies to invade. Let's get 'em. Come on. Yo! Let us slick back our pompadours and prepare ourselves for a little romance.

Uh, hi, girls. - Ghosts! - Ghosts! -Ghosts! - Witches! - Witches! -Witches! Uh, Wendy and I can explain. Yeah. See, Casper came up with this great idea. Do you mean to tell me that you have been hanging around with this -- this floating roll of toilet paper? Yeah. Get away from her before she gives you warts. But we're friends! No. No way I will not let you associate with this -- this puff of -- of secondhand smoke! That's rich, coming from a disenchanter! Go rattle your chains! Go peddle your potions! Oh, make us, you big Dairy Queen butts! That's it! We're coming over and scaring the bloomers off of you! In the name of the great sorcerer Nogamo, I command: that you turn these spirits into bean bags! Hey! Hey! Now, now, just a second... - One. - Y-You wouldn't dare. - Two -- - Bye. Run away! Three. What was all that? It was a bluff. Oh. Now, what is in your brain, child? Don't you understand that ghosts are our enemies? But Casper isn't! He's jus -- Look, girls, we can't hang around here anymore. We're going to have to go find another hiding place. No! I like it here, and I'm really, really sorry, and l'll find Casper, and l'll fix everything. Ay -- No way, Red. Now, march yourself straight back into your room. Hey, Casper, meet me back here in five minutes. Roger. Ew! Witch germs! I can't believe I actually touched her. You touched. I mini-doughnuted! Oh, I think I'm going to blow ectoplasm. Vacation's over, boys. If we want to win back our self-respect, we got to scare those witches out of here! Oww! Casper. Ow! Easy on the pottery. Better go into stealth mode. Oh, boy. We messed up good. No fooling. We got to stick together, Casper. My uncles don' twant me near you. They say you witches have killer magic. Oh, we've got it, but I can't use it. Come again? OK, here's the deal. But you promise you cannot tell anyone. Got it? Cross my heart and hope to live. I downloaded this off the Internet. The Top 100 Warlocks. At the top of the list is this bad boy Desmond Spellman. He's super powerful, and he's after me. Why? I haven't a clue, but if my aunts or I use any big magic, he'll find us and destroy us -- Got it? Destroy you? How? This is the only sure way... besides dropping a house on us. It's called the Mystic Abyss, and whatever goes in vanishes...forever No. He can't! Down! Peaches and Cream, this party's over. Uh, Good dog. Sit up. - Uh, ruff-ruff! - Good boy. Now do you see why my aunts can't afford a fight right now? Wow. That's harsh. So will you talk to your uncles and keep them away from us? Then I won't have to leave. Please? Well, sure, but -- You see, I'm not very good at standing up to them. Casper, you've got to. This is life or death. Please! Uh, sure, Wendy. Don't worry. I'll fix everything. And remember, don't say anything about the magic. I promise. Huh! This is no good. All right, listen up. I have something to say. There's the little traitor. Yeah. Way to go, air bag. You almost got us killed -- Again! Aren't you jumping to conclusions? Wake up and smell the funeral roses. Witches are dangerous. So we got to attack them before they attack us. Now, just a doggone minute. I have some say in this family, and I'm telling you to layoff! Uh, please? Who do you think you are? Yeah. We know more than you. Those witches mean business. Yeah. I'm not backing down. Let's get 'em. Right now. Wait! No, but -- but -- uh, listen! Why are you protecting them? Becausetheycan't usetheirpowers--Ch!* What did you say? No powers? So the witches are helpless. Boys, it's time for a little revenge. For glory! For honor! Formerly known as Prince! No! Stop! I promised nothing would hap -- Whoah! Wait! Wait! Let me explain-- Whoaah... Gee... Maybe he's sick. He looked a little flushed to me. - Ha ha! - Ha ha! - Ha ha! If it ain't the belle of the brawl. Oh! What do you want? Simple, newt-breath. This is our vacation spot, see? So make like Michael Jackson and beat it! Yeah! This place ain't big enough for the both of us. Huh! In fact, it's barely big enough for me. Never! And you guys better get out of here before -- Well, before we turn you into a year's supply of diapers! We happen to know for a fact that you broom jockeys can't use magic. What? Oh, my gosh... Casper told you! Yeah! Put that in your cauldron and stir it! Listen, you don't scare us. We scare you! Get 'em, boys! Aah! Oh... Ha ha! Missed me! Peek-a-boo! You leave my aunts alone! No! They were fast, but l was faster Paint these ghosts with a coat of plaster! Can't...move...arms... Yo, Desmond, we got us a blip! I've got you, you little hex-hurler, and l'm going to destroy you. It's the de-witching hour! Heh heh heh! Me, ruined? By a little teen witch? I don't think so. Think again, you pompous prestidigitator -- Aah! You get your phantom fannies out of here! Yeah. Yeah. We're going. What's that? Let's go check it out. - Wendy -- - Yes! -Yay! You saved us! Well, of course. Nobody hurts my family. Except for me. Oh, you -- Come on, let's go. Shh. All right! Wendy, Wendy, she's our lass. She kicked those ghosts right in the worst possible way! Haha! Wendy rules! Rules! Wendy rules! Yeah! La-la-la-la, all right! - Wendy! - Ah, ha! Wendy rules! Wendy rules! Um, excuse me, um... I'm really flattered, but I have to tell you something. Oh, come on, little Niece. No bad news tonight. This is your hero party. Well, in order to save you all, I had to use my...wand. Huh? And Desmond's probably on his way right now. Thanks a lot, loser. Start packing. Oh... Nnggh! Way to go, Wendy It's not a fruit or a vegetable. The tomato is a berry. Right, and your old man's E.T., 'cause you ain't from this planet. Go ahead. Ignore my wealth of knowledge. Shut up, you two. When I'm through with these witches, I'm going to turn the two of you into milkshakes. Ha ha! Ooh... Whoa! Right. Eww! Wendy! Wendy, my uncles are on their way over-- Thanks for the warning, but they've already paid their respects. Oh, no. Oh, yes. And how did they know that my aunts couldn't fight back, hmm? Wendy, I -- Is this your idea of making things better, by breaking promises? By giving away secrets? How could you? I thought you were my friend. I am! Wendy just let me explain -- No! And I never want to see you again! Now, beat it before I turn you into a bean bag chair! Wendy I -- No! Just -- Just leave. Wow. Yeah! Cool! It's that kid again. So cool... Wendy never let me play with her wand She must like him more than me. Wait till I get my hands on that little shrimp. This is all his fault. I normally like to get plastered. Way to go, dish rag. You led us right into a trap. Yeah. Those broomstick bimbos disgraced us. I messed up everything. You can say that again. I'm talking about the witches. This warlock's coming after them, and now they've got to run for their lives. These people are in big trouble, and they need our help. Us help witches? No way! No how! No shirt, no shoes, no service. You know, you three like to act nasty and talk big and be selfish, but tonight, you did something I'm never going to let you forget. You cared about those witches. Yeah, well... we was just pretending. Go... and search the cabins. Come on, Red, we got to put some sky behind us. But I got to find my wand. I just had it right here. Look, forget about it, OK? Look, it's nothing but trouble. But I have to look -- No, you don't have to look. But what about my powers? No buts, all right? Let's go. Witches, are we ready? But I have to -- Here's your broom. Be quiet. Let's try that one over there. Yeah, that's a good idea. You get that TV you wanted? - It's them! - Oh! Let's fly out the window. No, we can't! They'll spot us. Well, what are we going to do? I have an idea! What do you want a TV for? I don't need a TV. I got the pictures in my brain -- Ow! Hey. We're walking here! Hey, you see any witches around here? - No habla lngles. - No. - No. Are they following? No. I think we made it. Yes? They went that way. Thank you. Baaa. Wait a minute, wait a minute! Let's get rid of this garb, OK? OK. 1... 2... 3... OK, let's go. Come on. Hurry. Leaving so soon? - Aah! - Aah! -Aah! -Aah! Go! Move it, move it -- Hurry. Oh. Oh, hurry. - Ohh -- - Oh. Ch, no. ♪ La la la-la la ♪ - Aah! - Aah! Hey! Sit down. Yeah. You're the big, bad Wendy, eh? Yeah. And you're the geek who's been hounding me. What do you want, my lunch money? It's like this, kiddo. The Oracle said that you are a greater witch than I. - Her? - Her? - Her? That's what l said But then the Oracle is never wrong. Are you? No, sir. Never wrong. I had a devil of a time finding you. How did you live without magic so long? Well, we cut down on between-meal spells and -- Stop it. It's none of his business. No matter. You'll soon be out of my hair. By the way, how does it look? Nary a one out of place. Thank you. Wait! If you're mad at me, why punish them? If l get rid of you, I can't very well leave relatives behind who'll want revenge, now, can I? Won't take a minute. Hold it right there, bucko! Bucko? Casper, you came back. Yadda, yadda, yadda. - Help. - That's right. The Oracle mentioned a ghost. But never mentioned one so puny. You leave Wendy alone! A ghost defending a witch? Now I've seen everything. Aah! Omph! Stop hurting him! Oh, my. How very, very... sickening. If l hadn't lost my wand, I'd knock that smirk right off your face. Yes. Too bad, isn't it? Casper! No! - Ha ha ha. - No! Man, this is getting monotonous. Wendy's wand. Let's see how snotty you are without your stick, Miss I'm-Too-Good-For-You! Normally, it's against mypolicy to scare people. But this is an emergency. - Aah! - Aah! My, that was cleansing. From the halls of Kukaluma, to the shores of Xanadee, I call upon the dark forces of yadda, yadda, yadda. By the power vested in me etcetera, etcetera, open the Door of Dread. Behold, the Mystic Abyss. Once a victim enters, she never comes out; convenient, eh? - Wendy! - Casper! Ta-da! Stop him! You flying pillow case, come here! Casper, come on. Over here. Hurry. This what you're looking for? That was not bad. But not nearly as powerful as me. Help! Help! Wendy! Hang on, Little Red! Aah! Help me! Hold on, we're coming. Hang on, Little Red! No! Wait! Not so fast. Wendy! Aaah! Help me! My work's done here. You ain't going nowhere. They're gonna trap Wendy! Wendy! Casper! Aah! Casper, please help! Casper, I'm so sorry I doubted you. Forget that. Just hang on! Keep pulling! Silly spice and everything nice... ♪ I'm a little tea pot, short and stout ♪ ♪ Here is my handle, here is my spout ♪ ♪ When I get all steamed up watch me shout ♪ ♪ Tip me over and pour me out ♪ Witches one, witches all, let's get Desmond after all.

Yeah, well, we figured we couldn't let you have all the fun. Let's go get some breakfast. Yeah, French toast drowning in syrup. Do you know what they call French toast in Paris? Uh, toast? No. They call it Pain Perdu. Means lost bread Because, see, they use the old bread from yesterday -- My sisters and I want to, um, thonk, um, thang, uh, think, uh... Thank.

She's the greatest witch? She did something no other can boast. This little witch befriended a ghost. So Wendy you're the greatest. It is her l select. Someday she'll be queen, so show some respect. Yes. Hail, Wendy. We always knew you had it in you. Yea! Wendy for president! Well, girls, I think it's time we get going. Let's take another shot at that paperboy. Sorry. The judges won't accept that answer. Oh, sorry, Wendy. On your brooms. To the air. Wendy, wait. So, you're leaving, huh? Us, too. Guess this is good-bye. Yeah, I guess. Listen, I just wanted to say... I'm really gonna miss you. Next week you'll save some other girl from a swirling vortex of doom and you'll forget all about me.

No, no, no, Junior Counselors-In-Training, you've gotta hold the bar level so that guests can get under it. You two born yesterday? You know, after this guy, I'm beginning to miss Desmond. Ah, it's a living. Yeah. You know, I really like doing Casper's chores, don't you? It's fun. It's helpful. It's been a hard day's night. So long, Sunny Brite Resort. It's been real... friendly.
