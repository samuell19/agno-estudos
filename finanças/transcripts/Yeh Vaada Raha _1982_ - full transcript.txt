Vicky, if you wouldn't have helped me then I wouldn't have been.. ..able to sing in front of people and.. ..I wouldn't have been chosen. Vicky, I even liked your voice a lot. I want you also to sing with me. I sing with you? That means you don't want me to go back to Delhi. You are going to Delhi? My holidays are over and college will be re-opening there. And to be very honest, what is kept in this place? It's very boring in Srinagar. In Delhi, I have my mother, my friends and my business. And then.. And there is nothing to do over here. Don't touch me! What do you think? I was an entertainer for you in your holidays. You'll rich people can't see anything other than money. Today you spoke about money. After this, never mention it. I was just joking with you. I have taken admissions here and I'll be staying here. Near you. Really. Don't irritate me. After marriage I'll irritate you a lot. You will? Then I'll get angry. Then I'll convince you. How? - By asking forgiveness. Convince me by love. You never ask forgiveness in love. Wish you many happy returns of the day. You are there with me, that's my wish for this life. 'Happy birthday to you.' - Thank you. 'Home sweet home. Come in. Class. 'Happy birthday to you. Oh my God. How did I forget this? What is it? It's a gift from me. Your birthday gift. With lots and lots of love. Liked it? Vicky, you know why I love you so much? Why? - Because you are so rich. Again you talked about richness. I'll hit you. Why did you put on the light? - I'll cook food. "You are the one to whom my heart said yes." "I am there where you are." "Now living without you is a punishment."

I don't get hurt by thorns or stones. You sing so well. If we sing together, it will be so good. It will be so good. I don't have any other work that I will sing with you. Why will you sing? You have your own business. Sorry. Sorry. Now the song you will hear is sung by Sunita Sikand. You are getting up now? Your mother is coming. What? - Here is the telegram. This is the opportunity for Sunita. But the flight comes at 9.55. Mr. Joshi, I am going to take Vikram to meet the governor. Ok. - But he is not yet come. I will have to wait for him. You do one thing. Call up the governor.. ..and tell him that I'll be getting late. The plane has reached. Hurry up. Stop the car. Vicky. Mom! How are you? - I am fine. How are you? - I am fine too. I'm sorry, I'm late. Mom, how come you came so suddenly? You know how my work is. Mom, this is my friend Sunita. Madam, governor is waiting for you. Yes, we are coming. How are your studies going on? It's going fine. I am going back from the evening flight. You don't need to come to the airport. Pay more attention towards your studies. Come. What happened to you? Nothing. I didn't like the way mom behaved with you. Why? She behaved with me so nicely. Is this the way to meet anybody? You know this is the first time in my life.. ..that I have introduced any girl to my mom? And she know it very well that why I had introduced you to her. Vikram, she has met you after so many days. She was bound to speak more to you. And I had just come along like that. You had not come like that only. I had bought you along. Don't spoil your mood unnecessarily. Mom asked you twice about your studies. So from tomorrow we are not going to meet. From today, it's you and your books. Listen you want me to pass in my exams, right? Yes. But.. - So no argument. Pleas so let me study here. If you want to study here, then study here. Study. Prashant, open it and see your results. No, I am scared. You don't understand. Maximum, you will fail. Nothing more. Your air is tight. You open and see it. Why are you telling me? Open it. - I am not opening. Vicky, you have passed. What? -You have passed. - I have passed? What about me? - You also have passed. I have passed too. I have passed too. I have passed too. Vicky! "I had told you something sometime." "Whatever I had said I have done." "I had told you something sometime." "Whatever I had said I have done." "Have to fulfill these relationships forever." "I had told you something sometime." "Whatever I had said I have done ." "Have to fulfil these relationship forever." "I had told you something sometime ." "Whatever I had said I had done." "I will become a bride-groom." "Music will be played." "You will become a bride." "The stage will be decorated." "I will become a bride-groom." "Music will be played." "You will become a bride." "The stage will be decorated." "Then you will adorn my forehead." "Have to fulfil these relationship forever."

"On the bed of flowers." "Two hearts will meet." "Our lives will beautiful. Dreams will start blooming." "We will love each other in all revolutions." "Whatever I had said I had done." "Have to fulfill these relationships forever." "Whatever I had said.." "I had done." Listen.. Will you marry me? After mom gives us the permission. God, I don't have a mother or a father. You are my mother and father. Give me your blessings that I and Vikram.. ..should always stay together. It is said that if you tie a thread here.. ..all your wishes come true. - Is it? Then why don't we tie our love here? What did you ask for? - What did you ask for? This body, this life, this life, this body will never separate. You and I, I and you are one from today. In my every breath there will be Sunita. Only Sunita. On my lips, in my heart there will be only one name. Vikram. Only Vikram. No relationship, no tradition can separate me from my Sunita. Before separating me from Vikram, let God take away my life. Hey. In the form of this garland, our love will always be tied here. Till the time this world is there and this temple.. .. in this world and the garland in this temple. Till that time, we will be tied to each other through our love. This is our promise. Your flight has been announced and.. ..everybody has even passed through the security. What if you miss your flight? If I miss it, then I'll go from tomorrow morning's flight. No, you have to go from this flight itself. Listen; talk lovingly with mom about our wedding. I can't talk lovingly. - Why? Because I am leaving my love here. Now go. - Going. What's the matter? You are not eating anything. No mom, I had eaten in the plane. You want to say something? Yes mom. Mom, that Sunita. Sunita? Yes Sunita. You had met her in Srinagar? She is a very good girl. She sings very well too. Her full name is Sunita Sikand. Will you have coffee? How is the weather in Kashmir? - It's good. Mom, I want to get married to Sunita. I have asked some people about Sunita. Here, read this. What is this? - I told you to read it. A girl like Sunita.. ..cannot become the daughter-in-law of a good house. Sunita's father was a murderer who was hanged to death. And Sunita's mother left Sunita in an orphanage.. .. and nobody knows where she went after that. Mom, I know all this. But what is Sunita's fault in this? Not fault. It's her unluckiness. And if you marry her, then the shadow of her unluckiness.. ..will spread darkness in your life as well. Vicky, look at your respect, your status.. ..in society, your family. And she. How do I accept her as my daughter-in-law.. ..when she doesn't even have a family.. ..nor the name of her father and mother. I can't accept an infamous girl like Sunita. One minute, mom. One minute. I don't know what name my Sunita has in your society. And nor I am concerned about family and respect.. ..because I don't believe in these things. I just know that I love her and I want to get married to her. Your love is your personal matter. I don't want to interfere in that. But marriage? Vikram.. ..you are going to handle business.. ..which is worth lakhs of money. And for that you have to make walls on four sides.. .. of barristers, trust and truth. Even one stroke of infamousness can destroy our business. For your love, you can't destroy our family and our respect. I am not destroying our family and our respect. I have just come to fulfill my duties. I want your permission so that I and Sunita can get married. So is your answer yes or no? Listen, I am saying for your own good. Is your answer yes or no? Vikram, listen to me. - Yes or no, mom? No. Never. Sunita! Vicky! Oh, Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! How long did you take, Vicky? I missed you so much. How is mom? Come, we will get married now. She didn't agree? If mom doesn't agree, then won't we get married? But without mom's blessings? Mom will never give us her blessings. For her, everything is her business and money. For her love is a bargain. Even for my happiness, she sees her profit and loss. I have left that house forever. Only for our love. My happiness, my dreams are your love. Did you say something? Did you say something? - No. I accept that you'll are going to marry first time.. ..but what's the reason to get scared? I am there with you'll. I will do the kanyadaan. I think I should give you'll something. Here take five lakhs. - Five lakhs? It's a lottery ticket. If you're lucky you will win it. I am the only one laughing. Vicky, give me that ticket. Why? What if you really win it? You are strange. You are taking back gift. Okay, if I win it we will share the prize in half. Hello! Which hospital? When did you get the news about the accident? What was your reaction to this news? The reporters want to know that during the accident.. .. where was you son going and who'll were there with him? How is your son now? Please, this is not the time for interviews. What has happened to my son, doctor? Nothing has happened to your son. Nothing has happened? Then why is he still unconscious? He is still unconscious because.. ..his brain has been hurt during the accident. He is very lucky that he survived. Otherwise in such dangerous accidents. Well, according to the reports, blood has not yet clotted. He can come to consciousness anytime now. Dr. Sawahney, you will be here till my son is conscious? Yes, I will have to stay here. There were two more people hurt in the accident. The boy is not hurt very much. Just a small fracture. His parents have taken him away. But that poor girl. I don't want to listen to anything about her. Today everything has happened because of her. Your son was driving the car, madam, not the girl. Look, doctor, I don't have to do anything with that girl. I don't care whether she lives or dies. The accident she has faced is so worse that.. ..it would have been better if she would have died. Now, even her living is worse than death. What has happened to her? Her face is not her face anymore. Not even little bit. The glass pieces of the car has pierced her face.. ..in such a way that her face has been fully destroyed. Nose, lips, and ears, even her bones have not remained. The flesh of her face has been cut. Now what will happen to her? I wish somebody would have asked for her. Does she know about this? No. I don't have the strength to tell her. How is Vikram? He will be saved. You too will be saved. But the doctor says that.. ..it would have been better if you would have died. For you as well as Vikram. Vikram! He won't let you die and your face won't let you live. Face? Yes. In the accident, the glass pieces of the car.. ..has pierced all over your face. All the flesh of your face has been cut. Your nose, ears, lips, teeth, nothing has remained. Your face is no longer a face. It has become so ugly that if anybody sees you.. ..he will be scared. Will Vikram be able to see you in this condition? Will he be able to spend his whole life with you? No. Will you even destroy him? If you want, I can help you. If you promise to go away from Vikram's life.. ..then I'll give you how much money you want. Say, how much money do you want? One lakh, two lakhs, three lakhs, five lakhs. Answer me. I will go. I will go. I don't want your money. I have my love with me. I will go away from here. I will go away from here. Vicky's love will always be there with me. I don't want your money. Sister, please book a call for Bombay. Urgent. P.P Dr. Mehra. Son, you are conscious? How is Sunita, mom? I'll call the doctor. Nurse! Mom, how is Sunita? Why aren't you answering me? - Don't get up. How is Sunita, mom? The doctors tried to save her a lot. But.. But she died today morning. Good morning Dr. Mehra. - Good morning. So she is Sunita? - Yes. She doesn't have the desire to live. After you called me up, I was thinking about this case a lot. Do you have any picture of this girl? No. I don't have her picture. It's very difficult. - Even for you? For me, every difficulty is a challenge. And if the patient does not get well.. ..then I don't even charge my fees. The girl won't be able to pay your fees. When she gets well, looking at her smile.. ..I'll feel as if I got my fees. Those fees won't be of your profession.. ..but for your humanity. Best of luck. - Thank you. This body, this life, this life, this body will never separate. You and I, I and you are one from today. In my every breath there will be Sunita. Only Sunita. On my lips, in my heart there will be only one name. Vikram. Only Vikram. No relationship, no tradition can separate me from my Sunita. Before separating me from Vikram, let God take away my life. My Sonu.. ..You can't leave me and go. Doctor, did you see why.. ..I never want to meet Vikram again. Why don't you think that Vikram loves you? Not your face. Not your beauty. Daughter, love doesn't see beauty. Love is beautiful. You think that you can't get well? Your case is difficult. Not impossible. If you wish, you will get well. Your face will get well. Today, medical science has progressed a lot. Your face can be cured through plastic surgery. Today, through plastic surgery, a new face can be created.. ..even after your old face has been destroyed. You will get well. I will cure you. You are not only my patient.. ..but also a test of my long practiced profession. And to pass in that test I need your help. Will you help me? I want to get cured doctor. "We will never separate in any path of life." "My hand may never leave your hand." "Never get angry with me even in my dreams." "Nobody take away the happiness of my love." "We will meet like two waves meet each other." "We will meet like two waves meet each other." "Then we won't separate. Yes this is my promise to you." "You are the one to whom my heart said yes." "I am there where you are." "Now living without you is a punishment." Scissors. Quick. Is everything alright? We will have to do some more operations. You will get well and you won't even come to know. Now take rest. What are you thinking? After the accident, I didn't even meet Vikram once. So what's there to think so much in that? Give me his telephone number. I'll call him here. No. How will I meet him in this condition? Then wait for more 4-5 months. I assure you that you will be completely well. I will take you to Vikram myself. He will see you and he won't stop looking at you. Forgive me, Sonu. You must have been in lot of pain, isn't it? Bleeding a lot sir. Hold it. Sister. Thank you. How many days more? Now your heart wants everything to happen fast. How many months have passed? A lot of months have passed but only two weeks are remaining. After that, you will be able to see yourself. More two weeks? It's so strange! You're coming here, staying with us and being a part of us. Now you will get well and go away from here. But I will be very happy. And I will be more happier the day the band will be played.. ..you will become a bride, Vikram will come to marry you .. ..and you'll will get married in front of the holy fire and. And you will do the kanyadaan? You will do the kanyadaan, won't you? Sunita! Wont you? Daughter. - Father. Daughter. - Father. Yes. Yes, of course. Sir, madam wants you to attend the meeting.. ..with the board of directors today. See, I have told you'll before that I won't. Come sit. What have you turned yourself into, Vicky? I know what your heart has faced but till when this will go on. Today your mom needs you. Why don't you go to the office and help her in the business? I'll try buddy. Beautiful. Father. Beautiful. Congratulations doctor. You have done a wonderful job. Really, you are looking very beautiful, Sunita. Father, I'll call up Vicky. Hello, Vicky. Is Vikram there? - Wait a minute. I'll just call him. Sir, your call? My call? - Yes. My face! Why? It has completely changed. Now, I am not Sunita. Now, how will Vikram recognize me? How will he recognize me when I can't even recognize myself? Why won't he recognize you? He loves you. - But love too has an identity, a form. As god does not have forms.. ..in the same way, there are no forms of love. Yes, our devotion, our beliefs give it a form. But father, if that form changes then? If that body, that face changes then? Daughter, love is related not to the body but to the soul. It is said that if two lovers don't meet in the first life.. ..then they will surely meet in the second life. But there are no faces there. Then how do they meet? How do they recognize each other? Body and face doesn't meet. But the souls meet each other. I agree that your face is not Sunita's. But the heart is the same, the soul is the same. And Vikram will see this heart and this soul. I am sure. I am very sure that he will recognize you. He will surely recognize you. "We will never separate in any path of life." "My hand may never leave your hand." "Never get angry with me even in my dreams." "Nobody take away the happiness of my love." "We will meet like two waves meet each other." "We will meet like two waves meet each other." "Then we won't separate." "Yes this is my promise to you." "You are the one to whom my heart said yes." "I am there where you are." "Now living without you is a punishment." "I will rob you from the eyes of this world." "I will hide you somewhere in the corner of my heart." "In life, if we ever face difficulties." "I will take care of you and you take care of me." "We will meet like two waves meet each other." "We will meet like two waves meet each other." "Then we won't separate." "Yes this is my promise to you." "You are the one to whom my heart said yes." "I am there where you are." "Now living without you is a punishment." "Then we won't separate." "Yes this is my promise to you." "Yes this is my promise to you." Live a long life, son. How are you, son? - I am fine. Call my daughter-in-law. I'll go and tell him. I think we should get them married. I'll find an auspicious day and inform you. Greetings. Live long life, son. Greetings. Vicky, I am very happy today. Your happiness is given to you by Sunita. I have done whatever you have told me as my duty. But after today, I'll do whatever you want. Vicky, this will be the main building of the orphanage. These are the rooms where the children will stay. In the upper rooms will be the staff quarters and.. ..at the side will be the worship-hall. And here will be the gardens where the children will play. And this will be the school-building. What are you thinking? What are you thinking? Don't you like it? And here the name will come. Sunita orphanage. Shrimati Sunita Rai Bahadur orphanage. Can I ask you something, Vicky? Why did I get engaged to Rita? You want to ask me this, right? Engagement? Mom, mom. Where is mom, Shiv Singh? - She has gone to the office. The transport facilities have closed down. If the goods are not supplied on time.. ..then clients will file a case against us. Our cement company shares are falling down rapidly. If this goes on.. ..then we will have to shut down the company soon. Till I am sitting on this chair, none of our company will shut down. These are no-season clouds and will go away soon. You all. Gentlemen. What do you think? You'll print the photos in the news-paper and I'll get married? You have to get married, Vicky. - No way. There will be no one in my life except Sunita. Sunita is dead. - For you. She will always be alive for me. This is madness, Vicky. Your life is not so cheap that you can lose it for a girl unnecessarily. Look, I have not come here to argue with you. I have just come to tell you that I won't get engaged. Vikram! You are the owner of many companies in this city. You have a business which is worth lakhs. I am not interested in business. - Then what are you interested in? Shedding tears for that cursed? One day because of her you were going to be dead. And now even after being dead she is not leaving you. What is she if not cursed? Vicky, do you think that I want you to get married for my happiness? I am doing this because.. ..our business needs the name of Pandey and Saxena. If this relationship is made, then everything will be alright. Financers will trust us. The prices of our shares will increase. People will give us money. Money! Money! Money! You always think about money? Have you ever thought about me? When have you thought about me? After the death of your father, even I could have said.. ..that I am not interested in business. But I didn't do that because I had your responsibilities. And forgetting my own happiness and sorrows.. ..I lost myself in the offices and factories. I have fallen down so many times.. ..in the ups and downs of this business. But I never let you know about this. Vicky, today I need you. Have you ever asked me abut my health.. ..how do you do everything alone? Do you need help? You never asked me all this. Why am I doing all this? For what am I doing this? So that when we are losing our respect.. ..you could cry over your lost love? Our house, our business, our respect.. .. will be lost due to just one girl. Vicky, love creates a house, doesn't destroy it. That girl is a curse to this house. A curse. Don't say this, mom. Don't call my love a curse. No Sonu. You can't be a curse to this house. I can't bear it if somebody tells anything to our love. I will get engaged, Sonu. Just so that nobody can raise a finger at you again. Money can buy a lot. It can buy everything. Engagement with Rita is an unwanted compromise. Which I will have to fulfill throughout my life. But in reality, my life is a debt to Sunita's memories. The making of this orphanage is everything for me now. I understand your feelings. But will your mom understand all this? Do you think she will give money for this? I won't even let the shadow of her money fall on this. I will complete this with my money. Money earned through hard-work. Only then will it be completed. Hi Vicky. - Oh, there you are. - How are you Vicky? It's good that you came. Where are we going in the evening? I came to tell you that I am going to Bombay through this evening's flight. Very goo. Even I will come to Bombay. I am going for some personal reasons. So am I stranger? Not a stranger. But. But not even your own, isn't it? Okay. Like an Indian woman, I will sit and wait for you here. Okay. Chandu, call Sunita. sShe has said that she won't be eating food today. Won't eat her food? Sunita, take this. Call up Vikram. Tell him that even now you love him. Otherwise go to his house. What if he is getting married to somebody else? You still love him. He has betrayed you. But you will not forget him. Maybe you will never forget him. Go to him, daughter. You will be happy there. Go. Daughter, I know what is going through your heart. But till when are you going to cry for him? You can't end your life like this. Listen to me and forget him. Forget that he had ever come to your life. Forget that you had ever loved him. He has created a new world for him. You too start a new life now. See the world with new eyes, think about new goals. Daughter, it is better to break the relationship.. ..which becomes a burden. Doctor, somebody is come to meet you. So? Does she have an appointment? She don't have any appointment. But she is saying that she has an important work with you. Send her in. Good morning. - Good.. Not Sunita but Kusum. Yes dad. Kusm Mehta. A new face needs a new name. Otherwise how will it be recognized? Dad, I want to forget Sunita forever. You are right. You have a point. New face, new name. A new beginning to a new life. Very good. What have you thought about your future? You want to study? You used to sing in the radio in Kashmir, right? Start it here also. Your hobby will be completed as well as. - No dad. I want to forget Sunita's hobbies, her love, everything. Kusum was not related to Sunita, nor is she now. Sunita's voice has ended with Sunita. Dad, Kusum will never sing. Never. Sonu, now only your voice is left with me. Your songs are my friends now. Remember, you always used to tell me to sing along with you. Who knew that one day your Vicky will sing in front of people.. ..and entertain them and.. and you won't be there. If Sunita would have been there then why would you do this show? You are doing this show to collect money for her orphanage. Yes. I am selling my voice for money. But the song will be for Sunita, for our love. You want to start a new life, right? Then see Vikram through Kusum's eyes.. ..not through Sunita's eyes. Only then you will recognize yourself. Come on. "I am a prisoner of love." "Love is my life." "It's the duty of lovers." "It's the duty of lovers." "In all the seven lives of the lovers." "I am a prisoner of love." "Love is my life." "It's the duty of lovers." "It's the duty of lovers." "In all the seven lives of the lovers." "I am a prisoner of love." "Everybody in this world believes in relationships." "Those who drown in love are angels." "Everybody in this world believes in relationships." "Those who drown in love are angels." "There is such madness in love." "It takes whole life to love somebody." "With each day it becomes young." "I am a prisoner of love." "Love is my life." "A heart is where the flame of love burns." "I have told the story of my heart." "A heart is where the flame of love burns." "I have told the story of my heart." "You are my religion." "You are my deed." "Love is my only faith." "I am a prisoner of love." "Love is my life." "A lover is who accepts the other person." "You don't tell this to anybody in this world." "A lover is who accepts the other person." "You don't tell this to anybody in this world." "You would not know what love is." "Don't tell us all these tales." "People will imagine false things." "I am a worshipper of love." "Love is my life." "It's the duty of lovers." "It's the duty of lovers." "In all the seven lives of the lovers." "I am a worshipper of love." "Love is my life." "A lover is who accepts the other person." "You don't tell this to anybody in this world." Vicky! Hey, Vicky. This is the address of that girl. Her name is Kusum. But why did you need her address so badly.. ..that you made me hunt for it the whole night? I didn't even eat anything, nor drank anything nor slept the whole night. I can hear that voice again and again. Where are you going? To meet this girl. Hello Vicky. How are you? Rita, you are here? -I missed you so much. I am meeting you after 51 hours, 28 minutes and 36 seconds. And you are meeting me like this? No actually. Meet me like this. What are you thinking? I know what you are thinking. You are thinking why I am here. I can't stay without you. You can't stay without me. So, I came to you. My auntie's bungalow is here. But I will go there only to sleep at night. I'll spend the whole day with you. Come on. I am feeling very hungry. First we will eat in Taj, and then we will see a movie in Regal.. ..and then in the evening. There is my friend's party in the evening And she has invited you specially. You will come, won't you? Rita, I am feeling very bad about telling you no. But what can I do? I have a very important work. More important than me? That's not the matter. Just forgive me for today. I forgive you for the whole day. But you have to come to the party with me in the evening. Hello Kusum. My name is Vikram. Can I come in? Won't you tell me to sit? You are very selfish. You use your voice so miserly. Say something. You say. I am listening. Have you taken training for singing or is it your hobby? What do you think? According to me, hobby can't give rise to the pain.. .. which is there in your voice. Has the pain affected you? Yes. That is why I have come here. To praise my voice? To praise your voice as well as to request you for something. Miss. Kusum, I am doing a program. And seeing the success of yesterday's show.. ..I want you to sing along with me. That's it? You came to tell me this? Yes. How could you think that I will sing with you? I don't know. My brain thought of something.. ..then my heart thought of something and I came here. I am giving out tickets for this show too. So, I'll give you the money. Here is a cheque of five thousand rupees. You will give me money and make me sing? I won't sing for you. You can go. You are unnecessarily getting angry. I didn't mean to get you annoyed, Kusum. You think about it. I am not in a hurry for your answer. I'll come again in the evening. You tell me your answer then. You listened to her voice the whole night. Then you went to her house in the morning. You even offered her money for singing in your show. What is so special in her voice? This is not Kusum's voice. It is Sunita's voice. Sunita's voice? I know Sunita's voice very nicely. It's the same pain, same sweetness and same pull. I want to do this show with Sunita's voice not Kusum's voice. Come in. The door is open. My name is Vikram. I want to meet Kusum. Chandu! - Coming, sir. Go and tell Kusum that Mr. Vikram is come to meet her. Come. Sit down. I am Dr. Mehra. Pleased to meet you. You are telling lies. - What? You never feel happy while meeting policemen.. ..lawyers and doctors. But I felt really happy while seeing you sing on stage. Thank you very much sir. When is your next progamme? Actually, I have come to meet Kusum regarding that matter. You had come in the morning too, right? Yes. And she said no? I hope that she won't tell me no. What if she says no again? What is so special in her voice.. .. that you want to take her in your programme? Actually, sir, Kusum's voice is known. - Sir! Miss. Kusum is not at home. No problem. I'll come another time. What is happening, Kusum? What are you getting by living a life like this? If you are so desperate then why didn't you come out and meet him? No Kusum. You have just changed your name.. .. not your thinking. You have not yet forgotten your past. Sunita is still alive in you. No dad I am Kusum. I am Kusum. If you are Kusum, then how are you related to Vikram? Why are you crying for Vikram? Why are you hiding behind the curtain and looking at him? Why? Why? Good morning Kusum. Kusum, are you in a hurry? You want me to drop you somewhere? I don't trust your driving, Vikram. Sit in the car, my Queen. Otherwise sit on my cycle? Are you not ashamed of teasing a girl? - Don't create a spectacle! C'mon. Where do I leave you? Were you standing outside my house since yesterday night.. ..so that you could give me a lift in the morning? No. I just wanted to know your answer. I won't sing with you. Why? Why won't you sing with me? You won't understand my reason. At least tell me about it. - Why don't you leave me alone? Why do you want to enter my life? Me? I just want you to sing with me. Your business is worth lakhs. It is so huge. Why do you want to sing like this? Someone has told me this before also. You know Kusum; I want to sing in this show because. Now she is fine. You can go. I didn't understand something, doctor. A truck was coming from ahead. She just screamed and fainted. But there was no chance of an accident happening. Actually, Kusum has gone through the same situation before. You mean a car accident? Yes. That accident has changed Kusum's life. She has tried to forget it but. If it would have been that easy to forget.. ..then why would accidents happen? And life is also an accident, doctor. As time passes a person can forget a lot of things. Kusum will also forget everything. I'll take a leave. Sir, madam is not feeling well. She can't meet you now. I know that I shouldn't come to your bed-room like this. If you want, I'll go back. I have just come to ask you about your health. How are you? I think you are angry with me. Maybe you are thinking that I'll request you again to sing. Don't worry. I have just come as a friend. Why have you closed the curtains? See that's better? You are more than serious today. Look, I know that I don't have any right.. .. to interfere in your personal life. But this silence, this loneliness. This is a betrayal towards life. It's an enmity with one self. If you sit in the darkness, then you won't get anything except darkness. When you are lonely, your own voice starts sounding strange. That's why look for the light. The world is very big. Look forward. Look forward in life. What has passed has passed. Forget all that. What is the mark on your forehead? Mark? It is a coincidence that.. ..I have faced the same accident which you have faced. This mark is from that accident. But I have forgotten everything. You too forget everything. It maybe easy for you to forget everything but not for me. In that accident there were two friends of yours.. ..who were badly injured. You were unconscious, fighting for your life. And you are saying that you have forgotten everything. I hate people like you who forget their past days. I will never sing with you. Never. Please go away from here. You are a very emotional girl. And if my feelings have any truth in it.. ..then its my promise that you will sing with me. Is the 11o'clock meeting fixed? I had told you that I won't sing with you, didn't I? Didn't I say or not? Yes you had said but. Then with whose permission did you put up those pictures? With whose permission did you advertise that programme? You dared to do this. So much pride. You think you can force me to sing by doing this? And I will agree? Never. You can't play like this with me, Mr. Vikram. If within 24 hours, you don't remove those posters and banners.. ..then I'll file a case against you. I'll send you to jail. Understand? Listen. Your anger is my unluckiness. But.. .. I have a desire to sing with you. And I am sure you will sing with me. And I have promised this to you. So this is your important work? Due to which you are avoiding me so much. You are busy day and night in this work? What are you saying? I have come from Delhi for you. And you. If you wanted to do this, then why did you get engaged to me? It's not what you think. If you would have loved me.. .. then you wouldn't have sung with this girl. In this, there is a loss. - I am not bothered about losses. But you are not going to do the show with this girl. The show is very important for me. - That I have come to know. You don't know anything about the show. I don't need to know anything. We are going back to Delhi through the evening flight. Look, Rita, try to understand. You don't know the reality. I know very well what the reality is. It's not what you think. I don't want to hear anything more. Then don't hear. I am going. Hello. Mom, I am Rita. Yes, Rita, what is the matter? Mom, you come here soon. Please come soon. What happened? Vicky, with some girl. Mom, you come here soon. Okay. I'll come as soon as possible. Are you Kusum? Yes. I am Kusum. What is your relation with Vikram? It would have been better. if you would have asked this to your son. So you know me? Very well, Mrs. Sharda Rai Bahadur. And I also know why.. ..the owner of lakhs and crores has come to me. I have already told your son and now I am telling you.. ..that I will never sing with him. I am ready to give you how much ever money you want. Tell me how much do you want? I knew you would say this. But you can't buy me. Never. When I had nothing, even then I was not ready to be bought. What will you buy me now? Look, you are thinking wrong about me. I am not here to buy you but my son's happiness. Vikram is my only son. Whatever I am doing, whatever I have done is only for him. My money, my fame is all his. I am getting him married to Rita so that.. ..now the owner of lakhs and crores won't come to the roads. You don't know. Its better if Vikram and Rita get married as soon as possible. Then why doesn't he get married? This is my unluckiness. There was a girl in Vikram's life named Sunita. She was trying to trap Vikram. But now it's good that the girl, in an accident. What happened to her? She died. Died? Yes. I thought he would forget her. But even now he loves her. In her memory, he is making an orphanage. He is not taking money from me. He is using his own money. That is why he is doing these shows. Oh, now I understand. It's better for him if this madness ends as soon as possible. Now only this show's money is needed for the orphanage. But the show will take place only when you sing. I am leaving this decision up to you. If you want, you can give my son back to me. Dad! Dad! Today my daughter is looking very happy. I am very happy today. Do you know, Vicky is doing that show for me? I am the one in his heart. He still loves me. Does he know that you are Sunita? No dad. He still thinks that Sunita is dead. So then? His mother had come. She was saying that.. ..in spite of being dead, Sunita is still alive in his heart. Do you know he is making an orphanage in my remembrance? Then why don't you tell Vikram that you are Sunita? You are alive? No dad. If I tell him then he will not marry Rita. And if he doesn't marry her then all his business will be ruined. Vikram's happiness in future depends on this marriage. I can't take away Vicky's happiness for the sake of my happiness. So why are you happy? What have you gained? That he loves me. That's enough for me. I can live my entire life with the support of his love. By losing your lover? Dad, sometimes there is a feeling of winning. even when you are losing. You win even if you lose. What if I have lost, dad? At least my love has won. My love has won. Why have you called me here? To show you these photographs. Due to the fire in the factory, the whole face had burnt. This picture is after I performed the operation. This is the result of the accident. I am not interested in your photos or in your plastic surgery. Maybe you are interested in this photo. Some months back, a girl had come to me from Kashmir. She had lost her face in a car accident. Sunita And this is that face which I have given her. Is she Sunita? Yes. The person to whom you had gone to ask your son's happiness.. .. is Sunita. But she didn't. She didn't tell you the truth. She is happy with the fact that Vikram has not forgotten her. He still loves her. But she doesn't know that.. ..what she considers as a sacrifice is actually a suicide. For her, for Vikram and for the girl who he is going to marry. But you are intelligent. In spite of knowing that Vikram has not yet forgotten Sunita.. ..how did you get him engaged to someone else? You are a mother. And mothers sacrifice everything for their children. You are sacrificing your son? And for what? Your business? To earn more money? - Dr. Mehra! Don't shout. You have betrayed him, told lies to him. That Sunita is dead. If tomorrow he finds out that Sunita is alive.. .. will he respect you after that? Sharda Devi, think about it. There is still time. Otherwise you will lose your son forever. And remember, you won't get your son until Vikram gets Sunita. Will she come or not? She will come, Prashant. My heart says she will surely come. Do you trust Kusum so much? I trust Sunita's voice so much. That voice can never betray me. "I threw a pebble in the lake." "It caused a lot of storms." "To this walking dead-body." "It gave rise to the feelings of life." "Today two waves met in such a way." "Today two waves met in such a way." "No matter if they don't reach the shores." "We will walk hand in hand in this way." "No matter if we don't reach our destination." "Today two waves met in such a way." "This moment of love is so priceless." "Without love, what is the price of our whole life?" "This moment of love is so priceless." "This moment of love is so priceless." "This moment of love is spread in this world." "This moment of love is spread in this world." "No matter if we get this moment." "Today two waves met in such a way." "No matter if they don't reach the shores." "Today two waves met in such a way." "I was living only with the hope, my love." "That one day we will meet each other." "I was living only with the hope, my love." "That one day we will meet each other." "When we met I got a new life." "When we met I got a new life." "No matter if I even get death now." "Today two waves met in such a way." "No matter if they don't reach the shores." "Today two waves met in such a way." "We met, we met, and we met." Sunita! Kusum, did you know Sunita? I came to know about this today. Vicky will never be able to forget Sunita. And I will never be able to forget you. Me? You have done a great favor for me, by doing this show. Now the orphanage which Vikram is making for Sunita will be made soon. And we both will get married. Rita, you love Vikram a lot, isn't it? He is a very good human-being. Always keep him happy. Yes. You are really going? You have tied me in this father-daughter bond. And now you are leaving me and going? Just tell me something. What is my fault? No dad, I have to go. If Vicky comes here, then I won't be able to control myself. I'll stay anywhere except here. Dad, you have to promise me that you won't tell anything to Vicky. What have you come for? - What? I came to ask Kusum. What do you want from Kusum? Why are you behind her? Why are you creating problems for her? You will never get Kusum. Now you will never get her. She has left. Left? Yes. She has left. Where? - What have you got to do with that? Don't say this, doctor. I am already very troubled. From the time I have met Kusum.. .. my heart and brains are in turmoil. My heart is not ready to accept what my brain is saying. And my brain. You have gone mad. You are not thinking anything. Yes. What I am thinking is not possible. And what has happened is coming back to me again and again. I don't know why I feel that my Sunita is still alive. Doctor, Kusum's and Sunita's voice are exactly similar. Not only this. Whenever I have met Kusum.. ..I feel a shadow of Sunita with her. I want to ask Kusum why does this happen. Why do I feel that my Sunita is still alive? Why doctor? Because.. You want answers? - Yes. Then go and ask your mother. You will get the answers. Mother? Mother. Do you love me, mom? Do you want my happiness? Do you doubt it? Till today whatever you have done is for my good, for my happiness? Yes. - You are telling lies, mom. You never cared for my happiness. If you would have wanted my happiness.. ..then Sunita would have been alive today. Sunita! Yes mom, Sunita. My life, my love, my happiness. This has been taken away from me. But whenever I see Kusum, I feel that Sunita is not dead. She is still alive in Kusum's form. Who is Kusum, mom? Answer me, mom. I am asking you who Kusum is. You know that Kusum is Dr. Mehra's. Since when do you know Dr. Mehra? I.. Do you know what he told me? To ask you why I feel Kusum is like Sunita. How did you get the answer, mom? You know Kusum, mom. Who is Kusum? Yes mom, Kusum. Kusum! She has left her house and gone? Why? She has left her house? Is Sunita alive? Is what my heart telling me true? Is Kusum Sunita? Tell me, mom. Mom, I have lost her once. If I lose her once more, then I swear by lord's name.. ..that you too will lose your son forever. No son, no. Don't talk like that. Whatever I have done till today is only for your own good. I have done this for your future. My future, my good is only Sunita, mom. Tell me, is Kusum Sunita? After the accident, Sunita's face was fully spoilt. I didn't want to cause you more pain by telling you that. I was thinking that how will you live.. .. your entire life with an ugly girl. It was better for you to forget her than living like this with her. That's why I told Sunita to go away from your life. But Dr. Mehra gave a new life to your love. Her face changed but not her soul. Your love has won. Kusum is Sunita. Go, son. Get my daughter-in-law. Get Sunita. Vikram, you are going to get Sunita, right? Then why these tears? I have promised Kusum that I'll always keep you happy. And your happiness is Sunita. I have met Kusum. When are you going to introduce me to Sunita? You are very nice, Rita. If you can, then forgive me. Daughter Daughter, for Vikram's happiness.. ..you have sacrificed your love. But by doing this, can relationships be broken? No uncle. Till that garland is tied in the temple.. ..I will be tied by our love forever. I have come here to break that bond. Will you be able to break it? I will have to break that bond, uncle. I will have to break that bond. No, Sunita, no. This body, this life, this life, this body will never separate. You and I, I and you are one from today. In my every breath there will be Sunita. Only Sunita. On my lips, in my heart there will be only one name. Vikram. Only Vikram. No relationship, no tradition can separate me from my Sunita. Before separating me from Vikram, let God take away my life.
