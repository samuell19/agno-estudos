Once in a while when I wake up I find myself crying. The dream I must have had i can never recall. But... But... The sensation that I've lost something lingers for a long time after I wake up. I'm always searching for something, for someone. This feeling has possessed me i think from that Clay... That day when the stars came falling. It was almost as if... As if a scene from a dream. Nothing more, nothing less than a beautiful view. Ah, if only our voices speak at night could ever reach the vely edge of this world, and the time instead of fading into air and dust then what will the words could ever be? Farthest words from 'probably' let's make a promise, that will never fade let's say it together in count of three, oh ah, I'm told that some part of every wish will be heard but lately I lost sight of the truth in those words I can't even remember when I gave up believing what could have been the reason? Ah, the vely moment that the rain will stop and the place rainbow born and dies and where the end of this life lies I've always been insisting there was something that I've longing for one day we'll reach to emotions unexplored unprecedented we 'll high-five love we've yet to discover and give a kiss to time the five dimensions keep on teasing me but I will keep on looking at you, dear let's make a sign for when we say "nice to meet you" again I'm on my way to you, chasing after your name taki. Taki. Don't you remember me? My name is... Mitsuha! Mitsuha, what are you doing? Well, it feels incredibly realistic... What? "Mitsuha"? Are you half asleep? Breakfast! Hurry up! What? What? Do you want last night's leftovers? You can have it. - Good morning. - Good morning. Mitsuha, you're late! I'll make breakfast tomorrow. Is this too much? Oh well. You're normal today. You were nuts yesterday. What are you talking about? Good morning, even/one. This is an announcement from ltomori town hall. Regarding the mayoral election to be held on the 20th next month, the election committee... "Comet to pass by in a month: Visible to the naked eye" the comet will be visible to the naked eye for several days... Just make it up with him. It's an adult matter. "Position of comet tiamat" $4264 are preparing to observe the celestial show of the century. We're going now! Study hard! Mitsuha! Morning, Sayaka, Tessie. Morning. - Get off. - Why? Meanie. - You're heavy. - That's rude. You two get along so well. We do not! Your hair looks all right today. What? - Yeah, did your grandma exorcise you? - Exorcise? You were totally possessed! Cut out the occultism. Mitsuha is just stressed. Right? Huh? What are you talking about? You don't remember? And above all, restoring the town's fiscal health to continue its revitalization project! Only when these are achieved can a safe and secure community be created! As the incumbent mayor... He'll be reelected again anyway. I heard he's been dishing out the pork. Hey, miyamizu. Morning. So the mayor's kid and his contractor's kid get along too. Ew. Mitsuha! Stand up straight! - He's strict with his family. - I'm impressed. - So embarrassing. - Sucks to be her. Mitsuha. In front of everybody... "Who are you?" "Tasokare" twilight, when it's neither day nor night. When the world blurs and one might encounter something not human. Older expressions include "karetaso-doki" "karetaso/kawatare = who is that?" Kataware-doki? I think that's a local dialect. I've heard that ltom0ri's elderly still use classical language. Ok next, mlitsuha. Yes. Oh, so you remember your name today. You don't remember? Yesterday you forgot where your desk and locker were. You had bedhead and no ribbon. What? No way! Really? It was like you had amnesia. Well, I do feel like I've been in a strange dream lately... A dream about someone else's life? I can't remember clearly. I know! That was... Your previous life! Or maybe your subconscious linked to the Everett multiverse... Stay out of this. Oh! Tessie, did you write that in my notebook? Nothing. But mitsuha, you really were a bit weird yesterday. You been feeling alright? That's so strange. I feel fine. Maybe it's stress. That ritual is coming up, isn't it? Oh, don't remind me! I can't stand this town anymore. It's too small and close-knit. I want to graduate and go to Tokyo. I don't blame you. There's really nothing in this town. Trains come every 2 hours. The store closes at 9 P.M. No bookstore. No dentist. "Pub mother" "pub cat's eye" but 2 pubs for some reason. No jobs. No brides. Short sunlight hours. - Give me a break! - What? I mean... how about we stop by a café? - A café? - Really? Where? Hello. Hello. This is a café? You knew there wasn't one. Mlitsuha just went home. Things must be rough for her. Well, she takes center stage. Yeah. Hey, Tessie. What? What will you do after you graduate? What's this? You asking about my future? Nothing special. I'll probably keep on living a normal life in this town. I'd rather do that too. You're not ready yet, yotsuha. Listen to the thread's voice. When you keep twining like that, emotions will eventually start flowing between you and the thread. Threads don't talk. She means, "concentrate." 1,000 years of ltomori's history is etched into our braided cords. Listen. 200 years ago... Here she goes again. Sandal maker mayugords bathroom caught on fire and burned down this whole area. The shrine and old documents were destroyed and this is known as... The great fire of mayugoro. The fire has his name? Poor mayugoro. So the meaning of our festivals became unknown and only the form lived on. But even if words are lost, tradition should be handed down. That's the important task we at miyamizu shrine have. But that foolish son-in-law... As if leaving shinto priesthood and this house weren't enough, now politics? He's hopeless. Have another, my man. I'm counting on your help again. Leave it to me. You'll get votes from the kadoiri and sakagami districts. How's it going with her? It's not that easy. I smell corruption. Don't be ridiculous. Bring us a few more hot sake. Ok. Katsuhiko, work on site this weekend. Learn how to use explosives. Can't hear you. Yes! We both have it rough, don't we? Is that yotsuha? She's all grown up. They're both pretty like their mother. Hey. Hey. It's the oldest sake in the world. By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol. "Kuchikamisake." Do the gods appreciate sake made that way? Of course they do. Hey, look. It's mliyamizu. Oh! I could never do that! Isn't she embarrassed? I can't believe it. Cheer up, mitsuha. Who cares if a few classmates saw you? I envy your pre-pubescent lack of concern. Why not sell lots of kuchikamisake and use the money to go to Tokyo? Where do you get such ideas? Sell them with photos and making videos. Name it "shrine maiden's sake." You'll make money! "Shrine maiden's sake" no. That breaks the liquor tax law. That's the problem? I hate this town! I hate this life! Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life! What a fool... Ow! Ouch... Where... Somethings there... Ow! Taki! Are you up? It was your turn to cook. Wake up on time. I'm sorry. I'm going now. Drink all the miso soup. Ok. Go to school even if you're late. See you. Have a nice day. What a strange dream. "From tsukasa: Run, you're late!" What? Who's it from? Tsukasa? Who's that? I have to use the bathroom. This is too realistic. "Shinjuku station" I'm in Tokyo. "Jingu high school" - where'd you get it? - Daikanyama. The front act at the next gig... Let's skip club and go to a movie. Taki! Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch. You ignored my text. Oh, tsukasa? At least you sound apologetic. - You got lost? - Yeah. How could you get lost on the way to school? - Uh... well... I... - Feminine? I! L? L? I was enjoying myself. It's so festive and all in Tokyo. You seem to have a dialect. Where's your lunch? - Geez. - Are you half asleep? - You got something? - Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good! Thank you. Let's go to a café. Oh that one? Ok. Coming, taki? What? What? What? A café? Nice timbervvork up there. Yeah, attention to detail. Taki, have you decided? What? I could live for a month for the price of these! What age are you from again? Hmm. Oh well. It's a dream anyway. What a great dream. Oh no, what should I do? I'm late for work! Your shift is today? - Go, then. - Oh, yeah. Oh! Um... Where do I work? What? Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting! Table 12! Taki! Here you go. Uh, zucchini and tomato salad... We didn't order that. Taki, I said no more truffles! Taki, can't hear you! Taki! When is this dream going to end? Hey. Hey waiter. Oh, yes? There was a toothpick in our pizza. We could have gotten hurt. Good thing I noticed. What do you have to say? Uh, we“... But... there are no toothpicks in an Italian restaurant's... Excuse me. Is everything ok? I'll handle this. What's wrong with you today? Please accept our apologies. Your meal is on the house. Oh, really? I hope you weren't hurt. Um... Okudera... Ms.Okudera. Msfikudera. Thank you... A stroke of bad luck today. No, uh... Bet it was a set-up. Handled it according to the manual, but... Oh, ms.Okudera, your skirt! You ok? - What happened? - Slashed. That dick from earlier? What now? Do you remember his face? No. Come with me. Hey, taki! Take off your skirt. Oh! I'll look the other way! This won't take long. Done! Wow, taki! It looks better than before! Thank you for saving me today. Actually, I was concerned about you. You're weak but quick-tempered. I like you better today. Never knew you had a feminine side. "Jr yamanote line: 8 min." What a realistic dream if I say so myself. Oh, he keeps a diary. He's so organized. Wish I lived in Tokyo too. Oh! That's her! A crush, maybe? "Walked to the station with ms.Okudera after work, thanks to my feminine powers!" "Who are you?" "Mlitsuha" what is this? "Mlitsuha" wham? Wham? "Thanks to my feminine powers!" What's going on? Let's go to a café again. Sorry, I have to go to work. Do you remember where to go? Tsukasa, did you prank my phone and... Oh, never mind. See you. He's acting normal today. Yesterday he was kind of cute. What? Wha... what? Taki, you tried to outdo us! You walked home with her! Did I really? With ms.Okudera? What happened afterwards? I don't really remember. Oh really, now? Coming through. - Hi guys. - Hello. Let's make this a good one. Right, taki? "Mitsuha? Who are you? What are you?" You're not touching your boobs today. Breakfast is ready! Hurry up! Boobs? Morning. Why is everyone staring at me? Well you made quite a scene yesterday. Huh? "Still life drawing" doesn't matter who wins. It's all about how to serve up the grants. Shh! Someone's livelihood depends on it. They mean me, right? Well, yeah. Hey, mitsuha! Wha...? Wha...? I did what? Mitsuha? Is this... could this be... Could this be that we're really... In our dreams, that guy and I are... In our dreams, that girl and I are... Switching places? I'm beginning to get what's going on. Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo. I switch with mitsuha at random, a few times a week unexpectedly. Sleep triggers it. The cause is a mystery. My memory of the switch is hazy after I wake up. But we're definitely switching places. It's obvious from the reactions of the people around us. So... So we laid down some rules to protect each other's lifestyles. "No baths! No looking! No touching!" To work together to tide over this mysterious phenomenon. But... But... - That girl! - That guy! Guys are staring! Watch the skirt! Come on, this is basic! Stop wasting my money! It's your body eating. And I'm working too! "Braided cords..." You work too many shifts! It's 'cause you waste money! Grabbeo' cofiee with Ms. okudera. You two have a good thing going! Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships! Taki, why is a girl in love with me? You're more popular when I'm you. Don't be full of yourself! Not like you have a girlfriend! You don't have a boyfriend! "Fool/idiot" I'm single because I want to be! I shouldn't for her sake. You sure do like your boobs. We're going now! Get ready! Comet 77amaz' has been visible to the naked eye fora few days now. When and where can it be seen? "Comet tiamat to reach perigee" so it can be seen above Venus... Why the uniform? Grandma, why is the body of our shrine's god so far away? I don't know because of mayugoro. Who's that? What? He's famous! Here, grandma. Whoa, mlitsuha. Mlitsuha, yotsuha, do you know "musubi"? Mlusubi? Mlusubi is the old way of calling the local guardian god. This word has profound meaning. Tying thread is mlusubi. Connecting people is mlusubi. The flow of time is mlusubi. These are all the god's power. So the braided cords that we make are the god's art and represent the flow of time itself. They converge and take shape. They twist, tangle sometimes unravel, break, then connect again. Musub/ - knotting. That's time. Drink. Thank you. I want some too! That's also mlusubi. Whether it be water, rice, or sake, when a person consumes something and it joins their soul, that's musubi. So today's offering is an important custom that connects the god and people. Hey, I see it! That's the body of miyamizu shrine's god? Beyond this point is "kakuriyo." It means the underworld. It's the underworld! In exchange for returning to this world, you must leave behind what is most important to you. The kuchikamisake. The kuchikamisake? You'll offer it inside the god's body. It's half of you. Half of mitsuha... It's twilight - "kataware-d0ki" already. Katawa re-d o ki? Oh yeah, maybe I can see the comet. The comet? Oh, mitsuha, you're dreaming right now, aren't you? Tears? Why? "L'm almost there. Looking forward to it!" Ms.Okudera? What's she talking about? What did i\/litsuha do this time? A date? A date with ms.Okudera tomorrow! Meet at 70:30 A.M. at the station! ...was what I'd planned, but... Taki. Sorry. Did you wait long? Yes. No... Um... I just got here. Good. Let's go. He's so lucky. They must be together around now... Hey? I... Why? I wanted to go on this date, but if it so happens that you end up going, you better enjoy it! However, I'm sure you've never gone out on a date before, I don't know what to say... So below are some links to help you out, you late bloomer. Really? "You can get a girlfriend too!" "I suffer anxiety but got a girl! The dos and don'ts of texting." She's making fun of me. "Photo exhibition: Nostalgia" taki... You're like a different person today. Urn, ms.Okudera. Are you hungry? How about dinner... Let's call it a day. Yes. Taki, you... sorry if I'm wrong. You used to have a bit of a crush on me, right? But now you like someone else. No I don't! Really? No! That's not true at all. I wonder. Oh well. Thanks for today. See you at work. By the time the date is over, the comet will be visible in the sky. What is she saying? "Mitsuha miyamizu" oh, it's you, Tessie. No, I just didn't feel like going, that's all. I'm fine. What? The festival? Well... Oh yeah, the comet. Today's the peak of its brightness, isn't it? Ok, got it. Later, then. You just want to see her in ayukata. What!? No! That didn't even occur to me. Hey, she sounded kind of down. Maybe you annoyed her. Come on! Sorry I'm late. - Here she is! - Finally! - Your... your... - Oh! What happened, i\/litsuha? Your hair! Looks kinda funny, I guess? You think some guy is the reason? Ditched, maybe? Why do guys associate cutting hair with breakups? She said she just felt like it. Really? She just felt like cutting off that much hair? Oh! Hey! You can see it! Wow! The number you are trying to call is not reachable or has been turned offi... I'll tell her about the disastrous date the next time we switch, I thought. But... For some reason, after that, mitsuha and I never switched places again. "Mountains in gifu prefecture" "hida mountains" what the... what are you doing here? Tsukasa told me and here I am! Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me at home and at work. Takagi will cover your shift. Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal! This isn't funny. - We were worried about you. - Huh? You can't go alone. What if it's a con act? A con act? You're meeting an online friend. Well no, not exactly... - I think he's using a dating site. - No! You've been acting weird lately. We'll keep an eye on you. I'm not a kid! The switching stopped. My calls and texts didn't go through. So I decided to go see mitsuha in person. I wanted to meet her. But... What? You don't know where? The town's scenery is your only clue? Yes. And you can't contact her? What's this all about? Seriously. What a lousy tour planner. I did not plan a tour! Oh well. We'll help you look for her. Oh how cute! Look! So annoying. Oh, it moved! So it's impossible after all... What? After all the trouble we went through? You haven't done anything. Atakayama ramen. Atakayama ramen. Oh, then a takayama ramen. - Ok. 3 ramens. - Ok. Can we return to Tokyo today? We could be cutting it close. I'll check. Thanks. Are you all right with that? I'm starting to feel like I'm barking up the wrong tree. Why young man, that's ltomori, isn't it? It's a very good drawing. Isn't it, dear? Yeah, it's ltomori. Brings back memories. He was born in ltomori. Itomori...? Yes! Ltomori town! That's it! It's nearby, isn't it? - What are you... - Ltomori was... Ltomori? No way! Is it where that comet...? "Keep out" hey. Ls this really the place? No way! Taki must be misremembering. No. I'm sure this is it. This schoolyard. The mountains. I remember this high school clearly! That can't be true! Surely you remember that disaster that took hundreds of lives 3 years ago! Died? Died 3 years ago? That can't be. I still have the memos that she left behind... They're disappearing... Comet tiamat, with an orbital period of 1,200 years, "meteor strikes, wipes out town" nobody predicted that its nucleus would split at its perigee. "Town annihilated" "over 500 dead or missing" "lt0m0ri, the town that vanished" a fragment of the comet became a meteor that struck Japan. "It0m0ri, comet, damage" the point of impact was here. At 8:42 P.M., it struck where people were gathered for the festival. "List of the names of victims" and now nobody lives in ltomori anymore. Tessie and Sayaka... "Mitsuha miyamizu" it has to be some kind of mistake. This person died 3 years ago! Just 2, 3 weeks ago, she said to me that the comet would be visible. So... You 're dreaming now... I... ...aren'tyou? I... What did l...? Lively up there. I'm sorry we could only get one room. No problem. How's taki? He's still reading articles on ltomori. Newspapers and magazines at the time at random it seems. - What? - Nothing. I didn't know you smoked. Oh. I'd quit recently, but... What do you think about taki's story? I liked him. The way he was recently. He was always a nice guy, but even more so lately. Like he was trying so hard. It was cute. What he's saying doesn't make sense to me... But I'm sure he met someone and that someone changed him. That much is for sure, I think. It was all just a dream. I recognized the scenery because i remembered the news from 3 years ago. If not that, then... a ghost? No... was I fantasizing? Her name... what was it? Tsukasa went to take a bath. Oh, ms.Okudera. I, uh... I've been saying such strange things. Thank you for coming along today. No problem. "Tatara iron making site" "braided cords of ltomori" ls that a braided cord you're wearing? Oh, this... I think someone gave it to me a long time ago. I wear it sometimes as kind of a lucky charm... Who was it? Why don't you go take a bath, too? Yes. ...No. Someone who makes braided cords told me before... The cords represent the flow of time itself. The threads twist, tangle, unravel, and connect again. That's time... Maybe at that place... "Around here?" Taki. Taki. Taki. Don't you remember me? "I have to go somewhere. Return to Tokyo without me. I'll return later. Thanks." Taki... Eat this up there. Your drawing of ltomori... it was good. They converge and take shape. They twist, tangle, sometimes unravel, then connect again... Musubi - knotting. That's time. There it is! It's really there! It wasn't just a dream! From here is the underworld. It's the sake we brought. This is my sister's, and this is mine. Before the comet struck... so the i\/litsuha I know is from 3 years ago? Our timelines weren't in step. Half of her... Mlusubi. If time can really be turned back, give me one last chance... The comet! Your name is i\/litsuha. You're both my treasures. You're a big sister now. "Get well soon, mom." I'm so sorry, my dears. Dad, when is morn going to come home? I couldn't save her. Get a hold of yourself! Who cares about the shrine? You're the adopted son-in-law! I loved my wife futaba. Not miyamizu shrine. Get out of here! L\/litsuha, yotsuha, you'll be with grandma from now on. "Who are you?" Who am I? No, who are you? "Fool" he's so lucky. They must be together around now... I... I'm going to Tokyo. What? Hey, mitsuha! Grandma, could you do me a favor? Oh yeah, the comet. Today's the peak of its brightness... Mitsuha! Don't stay there! Mitsuha, get out of there before the comet strikes! Mitsuha, get out of there! Mitsuha! Mitsuha! Mitsuha! I'm i\/litsuha! She's still alive! L\/litsuha, are you touching... My sister! Yotsuha! L\/litsuha has finally lost it. I'm leaving without her. She's lost it. She's completely lost it. Scary. Comet 77amaz' has been visible to the naked eye fora few days now. Tonight it will finally reach its perigee around 7:40 P.M., and will achieve its maximum brightness. It's tonight. There's still time. Good morning, mitsuha. Oh... You're not i\/iitsuha, are you? You knew, grandma? No, but watching the way you behaved lately triggered some memories. I also remember seeing strange dreams when I was a young girl. Although now I've forgotten about whose life I was dreaming about. Forgotten... Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up. There were times your mother and i had similar experiences. Maybe those dreams that the miyamizu people had were all for what will happen today. Grandma, listen. A comet will strike ltomori tonight and everyone will die. "Nobody will believe that"? What a surprisingly ordinary reply, grandma. I won't let them die! Oh! What happened, i\/litsuha? Your... your hair! Oh, this. It looked better before, huh? Oh, that's it? Forget that! If nothing is done, everyone will die tonight! So we have to act! Why aren't you at school? Uh... we have to save the town. The community wireless system? Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere. "Superimposition, frequency" I see! That could work! You're awesome, Tessie! Hey! Don't come so close! What, embarrassed? Hey, hey! Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age! "Club discontinued - keep out" got them. Here's your change. Sorry, Sayaka. It's all right. - What a cheap fee. - Deal with it. What about you? Have you come up with an escape plan? What? A bomb? We have water gel explosives for construction at our storage site. Broadcast hijacking? The town's wireless system can be easily jacked using the startup frequency. So we can broadcast an evacuation warning from the school. The school is outside the disaster area, so people can evacuate here. It's... it's totally a crime! You do the broadcast. - Why? - You're in the broadcast club. I'm in charge of explosives. I'll go talk to the mayor. In the end, the city council has to evacuate everyone. I'm his daughter. I can persuade him. It's a perfect plan. Oh, whatever. It's just a what-if fantasy, isn't it? What? Well... Not necessarily! Do you know how lake ltomori was formed? "A meteor crater lake formed 1,200 years ago." Oh! So that's why... You're right, Tessie! Let's do it together! What on earth are you talking about? I said we have to evacuate everyone in town before tonight or... Shut your mouth. "The comet will split and strike the town"? "It0m0ri town hall" how dare you spout such nonsense? If you're serious, then you're sick. Madness must be from the miyamizu side. I'll get someone to drive you to a hospital in the city. I'll listen to you after a doctor examines you. You son of a...! Mitsuha! No... Who... Who are you? See you later at the festival. Let's meet at the shrine. - Don't be late. - Bye! - See you. - Later. You shouldn't go! Get out of town. Tell your friends. What are you saying? Mitsuha! - What was that? - Let's go. What are you doing? Could i\/litsuha... Could she have persuaded them? Ls it my fault? Yotsuha, leave town with grandma before nightfall. You'll die if you stay here! What are you saying? Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo. What's wrong with you? Tokyo? Hey, mitsuha! How did it go with your old man? Hey, i\/litsuha? What's wrong with her? No idea. Are you there? Is something over there? Let me use your bike. Hey, what the... Hey, mitsuha! What about our plan? Get ready as planned! Please! I'm taki again. What's taki doing here? The town... Is gone. At that moment... did I... Die? Taki. Taki. Don't you remember me? I'm going to Tokyo. What? Now? Why? A date. You have a boyfriend in Tokyo? Not my date. I'll come home tonight. If I suddenly showed up, would I bother him? Surprise him? He might not like it. The number you are trying to call is not reachable... There's no way we could meet. But what if we did? What should I do? Would I annoy him? Would it be awkward? "Tiamat makes closest approach tomorrow" he'd be a bit glad to see me? The number you are trying to call is not reachable... There's no way we could meet. But... ...one thing is certain. If we see each other, we'll know. That you were the one who was inside me. That I was the one who was inside you. I'm sorry. Excuse me. That time 3 years ago, before I got to know you... Taki. Taki. Taki. Um... it's me. Don't you remember me? Who are you? I'm sorry. But he's taki. Weird girl. Hey! What's your name? Mitsuha! My name is mitsuha! That time 3 years ago, you came... To see me! Taki? Mitsuha! Taki? Mitsuha! You're here, aren't you? Inside my body! Taki! Taki, where are you? It's i\/litsuha. I can hear her, but... Taki, where are you? Taki! Taki, are you... There? It's twilight - "kataware-doki." Mitsuha. Taki. Taki. It's really you. Taki! I came to see you. It wasn't easy because you were so far away. But how? At that moment, I... I drank your kuchikamisake. You drank that? You idiot! Pervert! Oh yeah, and you touched my boobs! How do you know that? Yotsuha saw it. Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it! It was just once. Just once? Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk. Sorry. Oh, this... Oh. Really, why'd you come see me before I knew you? There's no way I'd recognize you. Here. I kept it for 3 years. Now you keep it. Yes. How is it? Not bad. You're lying! No, I... sorry. You're really so...! Mitsuha, you still have things to do. Listen. It's coming. Don't worry. You've still got time. Yes, I'll try. Kataware-d0ki is almost... Over. Hey, mitsuha. So we don't forget when we wake up... Let's write our names on each other. Here. Ok! Mitsuha? Hey, i\/litsuha? I wanted to tell you. Wherever you are in the world, I'll search for you. Your name is i\/litsuha. It's ok. I remember. L\/litsuha. Mitsuha. I\/iitsuha. Your name is i\/litsuha. Your name is... Who are you? Why did I come here? I came here to see her. To save her. I wanted her to be alive. Who was it? Who? Who did I come to see? Someone dear to me. I don't want to forget. I shouldn't forget! Who? Who? Who? Who? What's your name? Taki. Taki. Taki. It's ok. I remember. /'ii never forget! Taki. Taki. Your name is taki! "Ltomori substation" Tessie! Mitsuha! Where've you been? He said sorry for breaking your bike. - Huh? Who did? - I did. Explain everything to me later. That's going to fall? Really? Yes! Saw it with my own eyes! What? You saw it, huh? Then I guess we got no choice. Now we're both criminals! "Broadcasting room" when the town's power goes out, the equipment there should work on backup. Please, Sayaka!

The comet isn't within the roche limit so the nucleus itself must have... In the pest; Comet shoemaker-lew 9 broke and collided with Jupiter in 7994. At least 27 fragments... I'm going to go look! They will probably melt before reaching the ground and the probability of a meteor crashing into a residential area is small... To predict the trajecto/y... 7'0 be witnessing such a magnificent celestial event and... That we're witnessing this live is extremely fortunate for those of us living in this age. Hey. Who are you?

Seems like I've forgotten a lot. I, too, no longer remember much from back then. Maybe we had a disagreement'; The other two returned to Tokyo without me. I spent the night alone on some mountain. That's about all I remember. But at one point, i was inexplicably drawn to the events surrounding that comet. Ha/f of a comet destroyed a town in that disaster. "Evacuation of residents to high school grounds confirmed" the entire town happened to be holding an emergency drill "an unprecedented natural disaster" "disaster foretold?"
