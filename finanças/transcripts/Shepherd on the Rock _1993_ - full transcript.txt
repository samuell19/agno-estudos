(bright music) (moves into upbeat music) - Look at those eyes. Now don't let it go to your head, but you're the finest little lassie I've ever met. (upbeat music) (whistles) Lay down. (whistles) (dog barking) (soft music) (dog barking) - [Ewan] Mister Ferrier? - Ewan. - And how are you today, Jess? What you doing? - You see this hoof? Well, needs pairing down to prevent foot rut. - Isn't it hard? - No, not a bit. Some shippers say to cut it 'til it bleeds, but that's not my way. - Mister Ferrier? Tam, can I have another go today with Jess? - If you like. You've been practising the calls? - All week. - Well away you go then. You see those two? - Jess, go wait out there. (bright music) (whistles) Come by, Jess. Come by. (whistles) - Gently. Give her time. (bright music) (whistles) - [Ewan] Lay down. - Good. Now bring her back. - Jess, away to me. - I'll make a hill farmer out of you yet. (tyres screeching) (dramatic music) What you madmen think you're playing at? This is private land. You nearly killed half my flock. - Well you should keep your stupid animals off the track. - Well what you doing driving around here? Are your eyes shot? - I own it. The whole estate. - Well not this bit you don't. - What? - This is my land from here down to the glen. - Which tenant are you? - I've just told ya. I'm not a tenant. (whistles) Come. - Do you know who I am? - Aye, you're that trespasser. Now you're gonna clear off or will I sic my dog on you? (dog barking) - Take it easy. Alright boys, let's clear out. (bright music) - Come. Come (whistles). (bright music) - [Ewan] Was that the new owner of Craigmore? - Aye, so it would seem. - Come. There's a lamb down there. Something's wrong with its leg. Think it's broken. - Well she's likely to be put down then. - No, must be something we can do. Come mend it ourselves. Can't let it die. - Aye well, it's not broken. It's just a gash. - So okay then? - We'll see. (bright music) Come. (bright music) - I see, that's for that visit. Alright, well how'd he get the land in first place? - How come nobody noticed this when we bought the place? Huh? What are all those lawyers being paid for anyway? Well? - It's his land alright. An oversight according to the solicitors. - Oversight. Incompetence more like it. Why is he the only farmer who owns his lands? - Apparently, the fifth Earl gave Ferrier's grandfather the house and land as a reward for saving his son from drowning in a boating accident on the lot. - Never trust the aristocracy, especially the Scots. Mark out the boundaries of his land. - That is roughly. - He owns a strip of land right across the axis road. - Well maybe we can get around it some other way. (upbeat music) - We'll never get a road up there. What about from the other side? - It's four miles, James. Besides, we'll never get planning permission. (upbeat music) - Oh we have no choice. We need his land. (soft music) - Good. - Think I've got it now. - Aye but we'll keep it down here for a few days. - That's all we have to do? - Now go get yourself cleaned up. (soft music) You best be off home soon yeah. Mother will be wondering where you are. - She knows I'm here. She says she's picking me up. You don't mind if I stay a bit longer, do you? - I don't. Have you no school work to do? - That's boring. I'll do it later. - Well now look. - Not much just if I want to be a sheep farmer. - Ewan, you're a bright lad, and the world's a bigger place than Craigmore. - I want to stay here like you. - Well there are worse places to be, but it's not an easy way of life, and you'd want a wife and family later on. You'll have to support them. - You haven't a wife and family. - No, no I haven't. - Why not? (car horn beeping) (soft music) - Hi Tam. - [Tam] Jean. - I brought you some stew. - No, you shouldn't keep doing this. - I made too much again. - Well, give it to Jess. Her teeth are stronger than mine. - You don't say? Brought your mail, too. The bank again? - [Ewan] Guess what I did today? - What? - I brought a sheep back to the flock. Well, Jess did most of the work but I did the calls. - Really? - Aye and I fine job he made of it, too. - And we met the new lairds in a brand new Range Rover. It nearly killed a sheep but Tam saw 'em off. - So it's Tam now, is it? - And we brought a lamb down. Had a bad gash in its leg. So we're keeping it down here for a few days until it's fully closed. - Alright Ewan, go and get in the car. - See you tomorrow. - If you like. - We'll see. He sure knows how to talk. You don't mind him coming up here? - You know I don't. - Well. We'll see you soon. - Thanks for the stew. (soft music) - [Man] All this and much more built by the most innovative developers of recreational facilities in the world Hawk Wing. - That completes everything we have for you at the moment. - Well you've done an excellent job, Keith. Well, what do you think, Donald? - I'm impressed. Will all be in place for me to make my presentation to the board next month? - I see no reason why not. - We'll have the full package ready for you by then. - And how 'bout your end? - All the money will be there, alright James? As chairman of the bank, I can guarantee that, but I'm still a bit worried about some of the planning aspects. - We don't envision any problems on that score, Sir Donald. We've made some informal confidential approaches to the committee. We have enough support to get it through. - The whole development? - Phase one. We're softening them up with the non-controversial plans first. The holiday cottages, water sports facilities. - No mention of the skiing. - Not until later. Then under the wedge. Well you know how these things work. - The environmentalists aren't going to like it. They'll say it's just another Aviemore. - No, please Donald. This is tasteful, harmonious development. Absolutely in tune with its surroundings. - You think they're gonna take our word for that? - Well the PR people are working on it. There'll be some smoke but I think we can ensure that there's no real fire, and I've always found in the past that mention the magic word jobs and the environment goes out of the window. - And there's always the landscaping in nature reserve plans in phase three of the scheme. - Ah yes, phase three. Now remind me. When is that scheduled to begin? - Well I don't believe it is scheduled, is it? - I don't believe it is. - Donald, we're business men not landscape gardeners. - Well don't underestimate the people out here, James. It's a close community. They don't take kindly to outsiders coming in and buying up their land and you need their support. - And I'll get it. Aye this place is dying on its feet. When they see what the development will mean to them, the opportunities, the jobs, the visitors, the prosperity we're bringing for them and their children. They'll be all for it. - Make sure they are. You know the finance is dependent on local support. Now, what about this farmer? Are we going to get his land? - Relax Donald. I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse. Hawk Wing. - Hawk Wing. (dramatic music) (microwave beeping) (dor barking) - Ah breakfast. (soft music) Here. We need some more of these. Can't go a week without, can we? Good girl. (bright music) - Good morning, Tam. Hello Jess. - Good morning, ladies. Are you well? - Oh we can't complain. - A wee rheumatism this morning, but that would be the damp. - It's age, Grace, not the damp. - Ah well I sometimes feel that way myself. - We hear the new lairds moved in at the house. An Englishman-- - A Mister Culzean. Missus McPherson says that he's planning all sorts of things for the estate. Changes, you know? - You haven't heard anything, have you? - Now when do I ever hear anything before you ladies? - Oh, we'll keep our ears to the ground and let you know. Bye bye, Tam. Come on. Bye bye Jess. - I'm sorry, Missus Feland. I'll put one by for you when you come in. There you go. - Go in. Down. - Hello, Tam. Come on through to the back. I'll fix us some tea. - I'd love to but I haven't time. I have to go to the bank. I just need a few things. - Okay. I keep telling you I can deliver this stuff. It keeps you from carrying it all that way. - It does me good. I got soft driving around all those years. - You alright? - I'm fine. - You seem preoccupied this morning. Something on your mind? I met your new neighbour, Mister Culzean. Introduced himself. Said he'd still buy his groceries here for the house. He seemed pleasant enough. - Aye well, he wasn't very pleasant yesterday. - Is that everything? - Ah no, one more. Dog biscuits. She'd never forgive me if I forgot those. - Five pounds, 20 pence. Just forget the rest, Tam. You can pay me back. - Ah well, put nothing on the slate. It's your livelihood as well. - It's 50 pence, Tam. - Now how much is that? - 85 pence. - Take it back. - Everybody's going through a hard time, Tam. - I won't take charity. - It's not charity. It's friendship. You know that. - Aye but I won't owe you money, Jean. Come. - Did anyone ever tell you you're a stubborn old goat, Tam Ferrier? - Aye, you did the day before yesterday. (soft music) - [Man] How are things, Tam? - I'm fine. - And Jess? - Aye, she's fine, too. - Want coffee? Well, anyway I wanted to speak to you about. - Aye, I can guess. - Hey, the office would begin to ask me questions of the level of bad debts. You're not the only one, Tam. Every other farmer in this area is in the same boat. Put us in danger of sinking. - Well, how much do I owe? - Nearly 6,000 pounds. - I cannot raise that amount. - I'm not asking you to but we have to start clearing some of it now or the interest is just gonna keep piling up. - I've already sold the Land Rover and I don't have much else. - You take main loans for the sales? - Aye. Now that you know the price is on there, it's not gonna make much difference. - You thought about diversifying? - Into what? Aye. Suppose you want me to do B and B and green teas in the hay barn. - Look. Go away and think about things. Work out your income and assets again. See what you can raise. Then we can start working out a schedule for repayment just to keep you right with head office. Don't Billy your head, Tam, but you've gotta do something now or you'll go under. You do that for me? - Aye, I'll try. (bright music) - Mister Ferrier, good day to you. Could I have a word? Mister Ferrier, just give me a minute. Look I'm sorry about our little misunderstanding yesterday. - Misunderstanding? I understood you alright. - I have a preposition for you. I have plans for this estate, which require access from this side of the mountain, and you own a piece of land right across that access. - The answer's no. - You haven't heard what I'm gonna say yet. - Yeah well I don't need to. - But that land's essential to us. You name your price. - That's all you people understand isn't it? - Well I was rather hoping we could discuss this rationally like two businessmen. - Well, I'm a farmer not a businessman. - Aren't they the same thing these days? - Not to me. Good day to you. (tyres screeching) - Look Mister Ferrier this could make a lot of sense to you. It's a hard life you lead up here. Well, you're not a lad anymore. Why not sell up and enjoy early retirement? I could fix you up in a cottage on the other side of the estate rent free. - I've already got that rent free cottage. - Yes and what else have you got? Be realistic, man. - Hey, that's Tam and new laird having a row up the street. - The days of the small scale hill farmer are over. How much longer can people like you survive? It's just not economical anymore. You're living in the past. - Aye and when I see the future you're offering, I'll stay in the past. - We're offering a lifeline to dying communities like this. Planned development housing, jobs, leisure opportunities. We are gonna bring people back to the highlands. - Aye, well I want no more part of that. - It's gonna happen whether you like it or not so why not be sensible and get something out of it for yourself? - Well maybe I don't want something out of it. - Don't be naive, Mister Ferrier. We all want something. - Get out of my way. - A quarter of a million cash. That's what I'm offering. - I don't want your money. All I want is my home. - It's the only offer you're gonna get it. - Aye. Jess, see him. (dog barking) (dramatic music) - Of all the pigheaded. He just doesn't listen. - He didn't mean it, mom. Don't be cross. - I'm not cross. I just, that is the last time-- - Please Mom. They're trying to take his farm. - And for a very good price, but he's too stubborn to hear it. - You don't want him to sell, do you? Not his farm. - Of course I don't want him to sell his farm. I know what it means to him. - Then don't fall out, mom. You know him so well. You like him, don't you? - Keep an eye on the shop for me, Ewan. I won't be long. (dramatic music) Get in, Tam. Get in. (soft music) What is the matter with you today? - Me? There's nothing the matter with me. - Oh come on, Tam. You barged through everybody like that and pushed past me like you've never seen me before in your life. I hope there's something the matter. - Oh well none of you should've been listening. It's none of your business. - Isn't it? Isn't it my business? I know you're in trouble, Tam. Every farmer for 50 miles is in trouble. - Well I'll sort things out myself. I don't need interference from you or anyone else. - I'm your friend, Tam. And don't take your anger out one me because I won't stand for it. - Well I want you to keep out of this, Jean. - I won't keep out of it. I'm not telling you what to do, but don't you think Culzean's offer is worth some thought? - It's worth nothing. - Oh Tam. - And I won't have you lecturing me. I make my own decisions. What difference does it make to you anyway? - It makes all the difference. - Why? - Because. Because. - Because what? - Because I care what happens to you. Don't you see that? I care. Tam, why are we fighting? I'm on your side. - Aye. - Well if you need any help, you know where to come. - Aye, he just rubs me the wrong way that fellow. I'm sorry I lost the head. - It's alright. Do you wanna come up for supper tonight? - Aye. I'd like that. - Okay. (bright music) - Whose idea was it to drink this? - I wasn't really expecting this. (bright music) - Don't believe any rumours you may have heard. Nothing is gonna happen without your agreement. - Aye sure. - You have my word for it, Archie. I am not gonna do anything that is not in the best interest of this community. - Aye, in your best interest you mean. - Well I believe it's the same thing. Look at this area. It's been in decline for years. No investment. No opportunities. No jobs. No future unless something is done to boost the local economy. How many of you have children have had to go away to the cities to Glasgow, Edinburgh, London to find work? Wouldn't you rather have them here with you working, bringing up their own children in this community thriving? That's what I'm bringing in. I need your help. I want to make this development a joint venture with benefits for all of us. At the moment there's one man stopping all of you from becoming rich. And we all know who he is, don't we? Landlord, another round for everyone I think. Archie, what'll you have? - Can I come up and see your land tomorrow? - Aye, if I'm still here. - What do you mean? - Well, Culzean's offer might seem very attractive tomorrow. - You're not gonna sell, are you? - He's pulling your leg, Ewan. - There's a good few people around here thinks I'm mad not to sell. - Don't include us in that. - I don't like him. - Aye, he's a bully. Underneath all that fancy stuff, he's just another thug. - That's what makes him dangerous. - He thinks by buying the estate, he can buy our lives. This is nice. - I'll get you some more potatoes. (soft music) - Jess. (dramatic music) - Is that it? - Must be. - What a dump. (soft music) - Must be out. Watch for the dog. - My pleasure. (soft music) - The dog must be with him. - Look at the stuff in this place. - You're an interior designer now? - Yeah, yeah I am. I'd like to make a few improvements. (glass shattering) - How many times have I got to tell you? (glass shattering) Like a bull in a China shop. (glass shattering) - Simon, you ought to know better. (glass shattering) (laughing) (soft music) - Well, goodnight then. - Aye well, is it that late? - No, no, I'm just tired. Goodnight. - Goodnight. I'll come up to see you in a little while. - Night. Well someone seems to be happy here. - It's just like home for her. - Aye. I best get going for I fall asleep, too. That was a nice meal, Jean. Thanks very much. - Anytime, Tam. Anytime. Look, why don't I take you home? It's a long walk. - Oh no. I don't need you driving back on your own. - I've been on my own for the last six years. - It's way past your bedtime. Jess, Jess. - What do you know about my bedtime? I'm taking you home. Don't argue with me. (soft music) - Come. Jess come. Goodnight. - Goodnight Tam. Tam. (soft music) You stubborn old goat. (soft music) (moves into dramatic music) - [Archie] Hey good morning, Tam. - Archie. - Have you changed your mind yet? You know about that offer from Culzean? - And what's that to you? - He was in the pub last night. You know he's got a lot of interesting plans for the estate. Could do us all a lot of good. If you sold him your land that is. - Well, that's my decision. - Of course. Of course, Tam. That's an awful lot of money. I'd sell my place like a short for money like that. I'd even throw in Granny as well. You'd give it a thought. He seems like quite a nice fellow. - [Tam] Nice? - We all need this, Tam. Don't disappoint us. - Yeah well you didn't see the state of my place last night. (dramatic music) - Mom. Think something's happened. I just saw Tam go into the police station. - Well let's go have a look. - Well this sows up my business, Tam. Look, I'll have to take a statement from you. - Aye but later. I want you to do something about it now. - Suppose I better come and have a look. You didn't touch anything, did you? Tam? That's the evidence. - I never thought, Alistair. I mean the place was such a mess. - Well it was foolish. I mean I can't do anything about it now. - Ewan said something had happened. Are you alright, Tam? - I am fine. I'm fine. Nothing for you to worry about. - Someone raked his place last night. - Oh my God. Is it bad? - Look, you keep out of this, Jean. I don't want you involved. - Unfortunately, he's cleaned up, so there's not much chance of us finding out who did it. - Look, I know who did it alright. It was that Culzean, the new laird. - That's a serious allegation. - Well aye but it was him. - You have proof I take it. - Well no, not in concrete, but why don't you go and ask him? - Calm down, Tam. - I can't do that, Tam. Not with evidence to back me up. - So you'll do nothing? - I can't. - Well if the law won't help me, well then I'll do it myself. (dramatic music) - Tam. (bright music) - Alright, alright. It's not very funny. - Why are we going native? - I have to play the laird, don't I? Bit of atmosphere but of tradition. - But I look like Rupert the bloody bear. - Yeah and I'm paying your wages so watch your lip. A very good day to you gentlemen. I trust you slept well. - Looking forward to a real good day shooting. - Aye well, I hope you'll no be disappointed. - Culzean. Culzean. - Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. One of the locals. - I know what you're trying to do, Culzean, but it's not gonna work. - What's he doing here? - You can wreck my house, do what you like, but you're not gonna drive me off my land. - Wreck your? - And the law cannot prove it, but if you try anything like that again, I won't need the law. - Now you listen to me, Ferrier. I usually get what I want, and I'm not too particular about how I get. You think very carefully about that before you do something stupid. - Now you think about this. If you want it, you're gonna have to take it, but you'll have to shoot me first. - Well now you're trespassing on my land, Ferrier. See him off. I'm sorry about this, gentlemen. No problem. Shall we go? - Englishmen prancing around in skirts. I've never seen anything so ridiculous. - Shut up. - Oh I don't know. I think it's rather fetching. Ferrier. You come anywhere near Mister Culzean's house again, you'll regret it. You understand? - Don't you threaten me, sonny boy. (dramatic music) - Hello Jess. - Mom look. - There's no wound. - Then where did it come from? - You stay here, Ewan. I'm taking her home. - I'll come, too. - No, you stay here. Come on, Jess. (dramatic music) Oh my God. Oh my God. Tam. Tam, it's Jean. Tam. Tam, get up. We've got to get you in the house, Tam. (dramatic music) Oh Tam, why? Tam, you're really hurt. You oughta be in the hospital. - Oh no, I'm alright. - You're not alright. You could have a concussion. - Well I have a thick skull. You know that. - That was Culzean, wasn't it? - Mom. - Ewan, what did I tell you? - Is he alright? Tam, you alright? - Ewan. - Jean, it's fine. - I couldn't wait there. I've locked up and everything. What happened? - I'm alright, lad. - Can I help? Please, let me help. - Well as long as you're here, you can fill up the kettle. (bright music) If you need anything else, I'll just be downstairs. - You don't have to stay. - Don't I? - Well, could you feed Jess? - Yes. - How many times do I have to tell you two? You don't do anything without clearing it with me first. You go at everything like a bull in a China shop and Simon you should know better. - Yeah but all-- - Shut up. (soft music) We don't need to go around smashing things up. I've got more effective plans for getting Tom Ferrier off his land. - So he doesn't know what else we did. (soft music) - Goodnight, Mom. - Goodnight, Ewan. - We're gonna be alright, Mom. Aren't we? - Yes, Ewan. Go to sleep now. (bright music) - Aye look. Come on. Let's go. (soft music) - You should've let us know, Sir Donald. - Well it wasn't planned. I'm staying up Trackmoore and Heisman a few days. - Ah yes, Mister Culzean. Didn't realise he was a friend of yours. - The bank has invested in a number of his projects over the years. - Is there a particular reason for your visit, Sir Donald? - The farmers around here. Are many of them customers? - Nearly all of them. We always have close links with the farming community. - Do you know one called Ferrier? - Tam, yes. Know him well. He banks here. - Let me see his file. - May I ask why? - Just bring me his file. He owes a lot. - Much less than most. Tam was never one for wasting money. - And he's in breach of the terms. - Technically yes but I had a chat with him and we're making arrangements for repayment. - Call them in. - Beg your pardon. - The loans. Call them in. - Sir Donald I'm not sure you fully understand the situation here. Every hill farmer's having the same difficulties. They've all borrowed money. The land price is plummeting and European subsidies are being cut. They're all struggling to repay that money. They're our customers. Surely we have to be flexible. - We're not in business to solve the country's hill farming crisis, Mister Cruichshank. - He can't repay that amount. - The bank must cover itself against bad debts. - You realise his farm's collateral for the loans? - I've read the file. Now just call it in for immediate repayment. (dramatic music) - How you feeling? - I'm fine. How do I look? - Terrible. - I'll be better. Fresh air and I'll be as good as new. - You will never admit that sometimes you need looking after will you? That's what I'm here for. - Yeah well, I can look after myself. Next time I'll have my shotgun with me. - Tam, I don't like what's happening. These are determined men. - Well, Jean what else am I supposed to do? - Just don't close me out. Talk to me. - Well this is my land. My way of life. I'm a sheep farmer. It's all I know. And they're trying to take it away from me. Who's that? - I don't know. I'll go see. - Jean? - Hello Alec. - Oh is Tam in? I need to speak to him. - Yeah, come on in. - Good God, Tam. What's happened to you? - What brings you up here? - Maybe better in private. - I'll just wait outside. - No stay. I don't have any secrets. Well, Alec. - I have to call in your loans, Tam. - I'm not with you. - For immediate repayment. - But I talked the other day. I thought that sorted it out. - So did. Believe me, Tam, I don't wanna do it. The chairman made the decision himself. - And why would he be taking an interest in my loans? - I don't know. He was up at the house and he called in out of the blue. - The house? Craigmore? And if I cannot pay? - We hold the deeds to your land. We'll have to sell it to recoup the money. I'm sorry, Tam. I surely am. I can't refuse it. It's more than my job's worth it. - And how much is that Alec? - [Jean] You can't do this to him. He has no other choice. This is all he has. - I'll surely tell him what to do like that. - [Jean] I'll come and see you tomorrow. We will talk about this then alright. - The water sport centre and jetty will be over there. - In the trees? - No, the trees will have to go, but we'll plant some new ones somewhere else. - That's good, Keith. Planters like that kind of thing. Donald, the holiday cottages will be concentrated in that area over there. - [Donald] How many? - How many we can get away with. - We're pushing it a bit already. We may be forced back to cut back the total. - Are you including the tenent cottages in there? - No, they're all occupied aren't they? - They are at the moment but as soon as we get planning permission they're out. - And the red? - They'll come down the south side of the glen, providing we get the land of course. - We'll get it. And the ski runs, Keith? - They'll start higher up near the top of the mountain. Do you want to see them? It's a good hour's walk. - Well, what about it, Donald? - Leave all that to you. - We'll check it out tomorrow morning, Keith. Lunch gentlemen? - Long as it's indoors. (soft music) (dog barking) - Aye. (whistles) - [Ewan] Tam. (bright music) - Come back here. (bright music) Ewan, I didn't expect to see you today. - Mom sent me up. She wants to see you. - Aye well, you tell her I'll be down when I can. I will be for a couple days. You see Jess away there. Wanna try calling her in? (whistles) Well, what are we to do now? Hmm Jess, hmm? Alright, alright. Nothing we can do. Accept. We can have another wee drink. (soft music) (moves into upbeat music) Aye, I know I'm old enough to know better. - [Jean] How much does he owe? - [Alec] Jean, I still don't think-- - [Jean] How much? - Around 6,000. - [Jean] The exact figure. - 5,865. - With interest? Transfer that from my deposit account please. - Jean, this will clean you out. - Do it, Alec. Then give him back the deeds to his farm. - Why don't you do that? - Alright. - I'll get them from the safe. - Good morning, Mister Culzean. How can I help you? - Good morning. Tam Ferrier's farm. Believe it's up for sale. There's my check. I think you'll find it's all in order and believe me, you won't find a better price than that. - Oh, I'm sorry, Mister Culzean. The farm's no longer for sale. - What do you mean it's not for sale? I know it's on the market. What is going on here? Or would you prefer to explain to Sir Donald Buchan? - Won't make any difference. The outstanding charges of the property have all been paid off. The bank no longer holds the deeds. Good morning, Mister Culzean. (dramatic music) - Well, I tried it my way. (dramatic music) - Can I help you? - Just looking. - She's a yank. - Can I help you? - So Ferrier's favourite girl yeah? - If you're not shopping for something, I suggest that you leave. - Are you exclusively his or can anyone have you? - Get out. - Must've dropped it. I'll pay for it of course. - Get out before I call the police. Go to the back, Ewan. - This your boy? - Now Ewan. (dramatic music) - Have a nice day. (bright music) - You closed up early today. - Yeah. - What's wrong? - Nothing. You look better. - I feel fine. Ewan said you wanted to see me. Sorry I've been so long. I've been busy. - Oh, there's something I wanna give you. (soft music) - What's that? - Take it. (soft music) - What did you-- - The loan's paid. The farm's yours again. - Ah no what have you done? I'll never be able to pay you back. - You don't have to. - No, no. I can't let you do that. I got myself into this mess and I'll sort myself out. Now take it back. - And how will you sort it out, Tam? Beat them up the way they beat you up? Don't you see the important thing is that you keep your land? When I came here I made a commitment to this place as strong as anybody else that's here and I'll do whatever I have to keep it together. Now pay me back if you have to, but don't come here and insult me. I think you'd better leave. (dramatic music) - Jean, I'm sorry. I really appreciate what you've done. I do. I do. I didn't mean to upset you then. Just didn't think. - It's not just that. - What then? What else? - They were here. - Who? - Culzean's thugs. - What did they want? Did they hurt you? - No, just before you came. They didn't hurt me but I'm worry, Tam. I'm worried about what they might do. - Why? Did they threaten you? - No, they don't have to. Their ruthless people and I'm here by myself with Ewan. - Alright. Well, what'd you think we should do? - Well it might blow over but just in case, I think I'll take Ewan to his Aunt Mary's tonight. - Alright, that's a good idea. But what about you? Would you like me to come down? - That'd make me feel better. - Alright. Maybe we could go out. - Okay. - Won't be much but I'd like to show my appreciation for this. - There's no need. Oh no I'd like to. I'd like to. You know anywhere? - Well we can go to the Italian place down the valley. - [Tam] Aye. - Oh hello, Tam. - Ewan. Ewan, I'm sending you to your Aunt Mary's tonight. - Aunt Mary? - I know you don't like it but-- - No, no, that's fine. - Pardon? - I'd love to go. I'll go and pack my bag. (upbeat music) - Aye, well I'll be down around eight, okay. - Oh no, no. I'll come and get you. I'm okay. - Aye. - I never thought I'd see the day you took me out for a meal. - Aye. Well. (dramatic music) - Tonight and remember an accident. - [Tam] Well what do you think? (dog barking) (upbeat music) (dog barking) - [Jean] I've never seen you look so smart. - Well you don't look so bad yourself. - But that tie. (soft music) How long's it been since you were in a restaurant? - 10 years ago or more. Things have changed a wee bit. - Thank you. So what are you having? - I don't know. See, what's that? - Tagliatelle. It's like spaghetti only flat. - Well I think I'll have spaghetti bolognese. That's the only thing I can see. - Okay. (dramatic music) (dog barking) - I've had enough of this. What time is it? - Nearly 11. (dog barking) - He's not coming back. - We wait. - It's been a long time since I ate out, too. I really haven't been out since Graham died. - Do you still miss him? - In a way. Sometimes I look at Ewan and I see him again. - Jean, I'd like. Well, here's to you. I'll never forget what you've done for me. - I have my selfish interests. (soft music) - Jean, if anything happens to me, I want you to have the farm. - That's not what I meant, Tam. - No, I know. Maybe Ewan when he's older. I don't know. Nevermind. - Tam, don't talk like that. Nothing is gonna happen to you. How's your spaghetti? - Oh, it's fine. I could've had pie and chips in the pub. (soft music) - You wanna come over for a drink? - Aye. - Good. (dog barking) - That dog is really getting on my nerves. - Where are you going? - I'll be back in a minute. (dramatic music) (dog barking) (soft music) - You've never stayed this late before. - Haven't I? Well it's a special occasion, isn't it? And I do feel more at home here than my own house. - It feels more like home for me with you here. - I'm not sure I want to go back. - Then don't. - It's been awhile for me, Jean. - It has for me, too. But we can learn again together. (soft music) I close at noon today. Should I come over after? - That would be nice. I'll see you in a wee while then. - Is that all I get? - This will take some getting used to. - Tam. (soft music) - All of this fog. - The weather, James. Maybe we should be heading back. - You're getting soft, Simon. It's only a bit of drizzle. (soft music) - Jess. (whistles) Jess. Jess, Jess. Jess? Jess? Jess? - [Keith] I'm getting soaked here. It can't be much further. The open ski station restaurant will be over there. We can get to it over the top. - [James] Okay, let's go. - Jess? Where are you, girl? Jess? (dramatic music) Oh Jess. - Simon. Simon. Simon. Simon. Simon. There you are. Where's Keith? - Well he was right behind us. - [Keith] James? Simon? - [Simon] Here. - [James] I thought I lost you. - [Keith] Look this is bad. We're gonna blacked out. Now stay close to me. - [Simon] Not that way. - [James] It's the way we came up. - [Simon] We came up that way. - We need a compass. I can't tell which direction's which. - [James] Stay close to me. (dramatic music) - [Simon] James? - Well they can be anywhere. - [Simon] James? James? James? James? - [James] Andy, give me your arm. (dramatic music) - Simon. Simon. Simon, we're down here. - James. James. - We're down here. - James. We're here, James. Can you hear me? Are you okay? - We're on some kind of ledge. I think I've broken my arm. - We'll never get down there without rope. We need some help. - I'll go. I've been up here before. I know where the edge is now. It'll guide me. - It's alright, James. We're getting help. (dramatic music) - Hang on, James. Won't be long now. - Had to come up here. It's your stupid fault. - Shut up. (dramatic music) - I need help. Your phone. Can I use your phone? - Don't have one. - I need to use a phone. We went up in the mountain when the mist came down. Please they'll die. You'd hear me? They'll die. They went over the cliff. We couldn't see it. They're trapped on a ledge just below the top. - Injured? - One has a broken arm. I don't know what to do. Is there a rescue team in Craigmore? - The nearest one's 20 miles away. - [Keith] Well where's the nearest phone? - In the village an hour away. - I don't know how much longer they can hold on. Please help me. - You think you can find your way back to them? - Yeah. - Wait here. - I can't last much longer. I'm gonna fall. I can tell. Where are they? (soft music) - Mom? Mom? (soft music) - Tam? Tam? (bright music) - What's wrong? - I'm not sure if this is right. - Well where were you exactly? - Somewhere near the northeast ridge. - Aye this way. You ought to show the mountain more respect. (bright music) - Get help, Ewan. Has Tam been here? Well where's Culzean? Just tell me where he is. - [Man] Up the north ridge. (bright music) - Right around here somewhere. Simon? - Keith? Keith? Thank God. You've been hours. - We've got a rope to pull them up. - For God sake man you gotta help. They'll die if we don't bring 'em up soon. Please. I'm begging you. - Well we best take a look. (bright music) Who is that that's down there anyway? - Mister Culzean and Andy. (bright music) - Aye, I can see why their feet just, but there's a big overhang. But we'll see if we can get a rope to them. - Do you want me to do anything to help? - [Tam] No. (bright music) - You sure you know what you're doing? - You'll just have to trust me, won't you? - [Simon] How do we know you'll bring them up? - You don't. There's a rope coming down. - There's a rope here. - [James] Can you reach it? - Yup. I can't reach it. Give me your arm. I still can't reach it. - Well lay down further, man. - I'm trying to. - Lean down further. Give me the rope. Andy. - James, are you still there? - Andy's gone. I can't reach the rope. - You've gotta get him up. - Aye but not from here. I'll have to go over probably from over there. (bright music) Culzean. Culzean. Can you hear me? - Yeah. Yes. - I'm throwing a rope down. Can you catch it? - Yes. - Again. You move nearer to me along that ledge. (bright music) Now, get that loop around your waist somehow. - Okay. - Now, move a little closer to me. That's it. Right there. Okay, now move yourself over the edge. I've got you. - [James] I can't. - Yes, you can. Go on. Culzean, there's a clip carabiner coming down to you. (soft music) Clip that onto the loop near the knot. - [James] I can't let go of the rope. - Yes you can. - I can't. - You can. You're safe. I've got you. Do it. Now clip that onto the loop near the knot. Is it on? - Yeah. - Now screw it up. Right, now when I say, pull on this rope. - This one? - Aye. When I say. Ready? - Yeah. - Pull. - You'll never hold me. I'm gonna fall. - No you're not. (soft music) That's it. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. - Ferrier. Why? - Well if you have to ask, you'll never understand. - Now you're a fool, Ferrier. You should've let me go. I'll drive you off that land. You're one man on his own. You'll never stand alone against me. - He's not alone. And never will be but you are. - What do you know? Those sheep down there in the village, they'll do whatever I want. They're my people now. I've got them here in the palm of my hand and they'll deliver whatever I demand. - Then why don't you ask them? (bright music) - I never trusted that one in the first place. - Go home, Culzean. Leave us alone. Come on, Ewan. Let's go home. (upbeat music)
