Is he dead? He’s alive. Excuse me, ma’am? How can I help? How's this TV? Expensive. Add another 2,000 and you could open a shop, make some money. They’re all rip-offs. Really? Really. Never mind that. At the shop opposite they’re giving away key chains. Grab a few while you can. You little pauper. Go on. Run. Tulin, Tulin, Tulin. You’re a sales rep. Why didn’t you list this TV’s features? Why’d you lose that customer? Supervisor, he wasn’t interested in a TV. I politely got rid of him so he wouldn’t block the entrance. He might have bought one. Sir, malls are where poor people hang out in the summer. People with no air conditioning fight the heat by dropping their kids at the play area and cooling off in here. How do you know that? It’s what we did. The whole neighborhood hung out in malls. Why do you think movie audiences shrink in the summer? Because it’s hot, right? You don’t understand, Supervisor. When paupers go to a movie, they stop at the supermarket first and fill their coats with cola and candy to gobble up in the dark. They can’t wear coats in summer, so... Get it? The system collapses. The sector stands still. How did you survive this long? It is a miracle. How do you cross the street without getting run over? Here, take it! I’m so sorry. So very sorry. I forgot in the excitement. Off you go! You’re fired! Say goodbye to your friends. Go home. Go on! Not again. How many times is it now, Saffet? Do you think she’s helpless? What kind of uncle are you? Don’t you love your niece? You keep firing her, you dog! I’m your big brother, Yakut. Watch your mouth. She doesn’t want to work. Here, charge it. She’s a sales worker. If she works hard, are you going to make her CEO? What minimum wage worker loves their job? I’ve never seen one. You’re right. At work, he won’t let me call him “uncle.” Why do I have to call my own uncle “supervisor”? Is he ashamed of me? I’m ashamed of you, too. But that’s not the issue. Hush. I’m getting to it. Mom, you’re sitting on the fence. You’re selling us both out. Where’s your brother? Out chasing women again. You’re both useless. At least you have an excuse. You’re an idiot. Your brother studied medicine. Then he made a lateral move to chasing women. Your poor mother. How she’s suffered. “Lateral move” confused you. Your eyes are blank. Fool! Niyazi’s coming soon. Right, Tulin? He’s on his way. Get my car. That’s not my car. It’s a minibus! Guys... Listen carefully. This is your last chance. I’ll give you $50,000 to leave my daughter alone-- Okay. I’m not finished. There’s no need, sir. Don’t bother. I heard the word “dollar.” The value keeps fluctuating, so time is money. You have no objections? Money’s worth more than your honor? Hold on a minute. I’ve got my honor, of course. But it’s for sale, too. Money’s what motivates me. Are you paying in dollars, or in lira? If it's lira, I want the sell rate. The buy rate is low. There’s a spread. You never loved my daughter? Of course I did. Just a little while ago. She’s a loveable girl. You took good care of her. She’s so shiny and clean. But my main desire is money. It’s a question of character. And if you were rich? Would you still agree? If I were rich, it would be different. The poor settle for less. I’d want a few hundred thousand. Fifty thousand dollars wouldn’t cut it. But business is bad right now. There’s no turnover. I need a prospect. If you go on like this you’ll get a prospect in the ass. Okay then. Call me. Kisses. Take care. Hang on. There’s been a mix-up. That’s not my house. You dropped me off at the wrong place. I dropped you off? -Are you okay? -I’m okay. Why? What’s the wheel doing here? We’re in Cyprus. Should we go to the hospital? You’re starting to scare me. There’s nothing to be scared of. I’m coming to my senses. What happened? I was opening the door. I don’t remember the rest. Who are you? Why am I dropping you off? Or is it that... you’re my girlfriend? So, you don’t realize we’re in a taxi, either? Hang on. I’m a taxi driver. Oh! Then you’re my fare. So, before I opened the door, what did you say that made me forget everything? I don’t have enough money. I said, "If you like, I can pay you some other way... at my place." Really? Okay, no problem. A girl and me. That means sex. Because I’m still a virgin, it’s normal for me to lose my head. The effect your sex has on me is so hard to imagine, Miss. You see this button? No. I don’t see a dress or anything. Pull yourself together! I’m a Youtuber. This is a camera prank. A social experiment. Those are just details. Hush! Let me get to it. I’ll get on top if you’re tired. You’ve started without me. Good luck with that. If I uploaded this, millions would see it. But I pity your parents too much to do that. It’s good you two divorced. He’s gone off the rails. He’s living at the extremes. Like all ultra-rich guys, he’s gone crazy. You think so, Saffet? You would know. The guy divorced me and took up with you. You’re with him all the time. That’s my job. He needs me 24/7. I’m his go-to guy. I recharge three times a day. They say there’s a woman. They’re going to get married. He won’t do that, will he? I don’t want the kids’ inheritance to be divided when he pops off. How can you talk like that? What did he do to you? You got divorced is all. It stings! After we split, he got rich. It’s not fair. I’ve been cheated! I put up with him and then someone else gets all the spoils. Look at that. Fifteen missed calls. Dozens of texts. Karun Bey had a heart attack. He’s in intensive care. Come immediately. -Yakut. -What? He had a heart attack. What? Dad? Is he okay? How is he? Oh, please! I got overexcited. I shouldn’t celebrate, right? If you don’t mind. You’re right. If he lives, I’ll have celebrated for nothing. Niyazi. Call Niyazi. Quick! Tulin? What’s the matter? You keep calling me. I mean, is Mom dead or Dad? Dad. No way. I was only joking. I keep telling Mom, too. Don’t joke about these things. Jokes can turn real. He’s in bad condition. Near death, they said. If he dies without marrying again the inheritance will be intact. You’ll get everything. Your dad will actually do you some good. They say that woman already has a child. What child? Dad? -What is it, Mom? -Come here, son. What is it? What happened? Something’s wrong. It must be Grandpa. Get out of here! Your Grandpa’s fine. Your dad dying would be better. Don’t say that, Dad. Just stay well. Listen, son. We were going to tell you before. But it was always too soon. We can’t keep it a secret anymore. Your Dad isn’t well. What are you saying, Mom? Don’t eat pastry at night. You’ve got to control yourself. How bad is he? They give him a week. Oh, no! How could this happen? Is God testing us? -Dad. -What? Don’t worry. You’ll live it up your last week. Leave it to me. Food, drink, running around, fun. No worries. I’ll look after Mom when you’re gone. A cotton plug? Or silicon? Your choice. Selim, darling. Your real dad is dying. He isn’t your dad. Hang on a minute. Now... my dad is my stepdad? Is that what you’re saying? Is that why you laid out a feast? To tell me this? You’re right, son. So, I’m a stepson. Unbelievable. Did you know about this, Dad? Of course. It would be strange if I didn’t. I loved you to death. Even more than Mom. That’s normal. Because she isn’t your real mom. She’s your stepmom. You’re telling me in installments. Tell me all at once! When the first one doesn’t kill me, fire another bullet. Are you done now? Since you’re not a blood relative, call me by my name now. Call me Yavuz. He took away the title of Dad. Now he’s a legal entity. Take this. Here. What is it? A testimonial? He’s stupid, but that’s a good joke. Open it. It’s your real father’s contact info. You’re taking the first plane to Istanbul tomorrow. There’s your ticket. And a little money. So you’re not poor there. Okay? Wow. Selim. Taxi driver Selim, a bit of brotherly advice. Wake up and open your eyes. You’re on your own. You need to be careful. Don’t trust anyone. It’s Istanbul. They’ll eat you for breakfast. You’ve got to be brutal, too. Show no pity. Show pity and they’ll screw you. Then call you a whore. Remember that. Don’t say I didn’t tell you. What are you saying, Yavuz? How can you use curse words with me? It’s a proverb. It’s been verified as true, scientifically proven. What kind of ancestors do you have? Someone curses, and you think it’s a proverb. Our ancestors are people, too. Don’t get upset. I’ll be going. I’ll spend time with my real dad before he dies. Before I forget, I’ve eaten your bread. Give me your blessing. -I give mine. -You have my blessing. What’s all this? My, oh, my. Look who’s here. So nice to see you! Niyazi... and Tulin. We’re honored. How was the trip? We drove over. We parked over by the stand. Why’d you ask? Are they towing my car? It was fine. He’s just being polite. Never mind the trip. How is my first love, my hero, my five-clawed dog? Tell me. Is he okay? He’ll live, won’t he? Please be strong. He’s got a week at most. How can I be strong? Death always comes early. There are seven days in a week. Have we arrived early? There’s still time. You see? I can’t believe my eyes. Can we see Dad? Of course. He wants to discuss the will. But only with his children. Just a moment. Be alert. Show no mercy. Don’t get emotional. Take him for all he’s got. Make him pity you. Grab everything. Children, do it for us all. Mom, you’re still crying. You think these are taps? They’ll stop when they’re ready. In order to cry, I imagined what it would be like to lose the inheritance. Now I can’t stop. Okay, Mom. We won’t cry in front of Dad. I don’t know how. But I won’t. A mother’s heart. Yakut, you can wait here. -Let’s go upstairs. -After you. They've arrived. Shall we meet them together? -Has Selim arrived? -Yes. No. I’ll join you with my brother-in-law. Okay, sir. This way. One more person will be joining your group. Let’s wait for the third sibling. -The third? -The third? The third? Is the inheritance being divided? Saffet. Where are you? They say there’s a third one. Did he marry that woman? You said he didn’t. He didn’t marry her. This child is from before you. He has arrived. Asli will explain everything. Just look at that face. You imitation woman! All covered in makeup. Gold-digger! It’s true. Bad sex leads to a child with no nose. What kind of woman is this? Madame, I’m a corporate lawyer. The third child is Selim. Just look at that face. Broad mouth, dimwit expression, big nose, stupid stare. Buck-toothed. Is it Husniye? He’s the spitting image of my aunt’s girl, Frisky Husniye. So that’s why she didn’t come to the wedding. He married me. She was jealous. Saffet, say it isn’t true! She wasn’t jealous, Yakut. She was pregnant at the time. That’s why she didn’t attend the wedding. They were flirting while we were engaged? There was no flirting. They yielded to temptation. They were blind drunk that night. Which night? The night he asked for your hand. You don’t say! The guy’s a sniper. He banged the girl helping me with my jewelry. Their family spent the night. The guy scored at an away game. Know your father! Know him and show no pity! From what I understand, you two are... my half siblings. Husniye was my real mother. How can I see her? Where did we bury Husniye? Where’s her grave? She died giving birth to you. So, did my mother have any other children? No, Selim. You’re an only child. Way to go, Mom! I don’t have to share my part of the inheritance. May she rest in peace. Life goes on. What are you looking at? I never met the woman. She died years ago. Why should I grieve? We never had a mother-son moment. Let’s go. Hurry up. Get going. Saffet is about to arrive. We’ll all go in together. Saffet, Saffet. You’re still alive. Children... I lost touch with you all after I got rich. Because everything you see here was obtained illegally. Theft, fraud, extortion, snatching, snitching, swiping, pinching. I did it all. -Sinful gain-- -Let me interrupt. Go ahead, daughter. Daddy, you say "sinful," but I have to tell you that my brother, Niyazi, is a true sinner. Exactly. An unrepentant heathen. I don’t know the difference between sin and virtue. He won’t be facing judgment on the other side, Dad. He’s going straight to Hell. He’ll burn there. Exactly. Don’t worry about my afterlife. I’ve done it all in this life. For me, it ends when it ends. We’re just like you, Dad. We’re all the same. Hang on. We’re not all the same. I’ve always avoided that. No ill-gotten gains for me. This will be the first time. I’m excited. They say it’s sweeter than honey. If it’s a sin, so be it. I can always repent. Why lose hope in God? That’s blasphemy. I did more than reproduce! My cells were duplicated in your mothers' wombs. Only Tulin is different. Your father has a proposal for you. What he has earned righteously will be left to his children. The rest of the money, he wants to donate to charity. Now... by “righteously,” how much money does he mean? Selim, you get the license to your taxi, and your taxi stand. Tulin, you get the deed to the store where you work. Niyazi, for you to finish med school and start your own practice, I leave you $500,000. That’s what I bequeath. But if it’s not enough for you, then things get fun. Beloved father, how much is your fortune, exactly? One billion, give or take a little. Give or take? I’ll take it! Screw the calories burned to make that sentence! That’s a lot of money. I’d smack you if you weren’t my uncle. He’s not my uncle. I’ll beat him like a drum. I’ll screw you all! For goodness sake! Who wouldn’t make mincemeat of their dad for a billion? Piss off. No, they wouldn’t! Fathers are good! When he dies, is that how much we get? I’ll handle this. Give me that cushion. Give it to me. I apologize for my brother. Whatever I do is normal. I lost my head. Saffet, my boy’s a real meteor. They’d wipe out mankind. Daddy, let us think it over. We’ll discuss it. Let’s not rush. Right? Best not to rush. I’ve heard enough. Now, let me explain as clearly as I can. Let this be a lesson. Bye-bye, poor people. Do you want to delete all contacts? Delete / Cancel Go to the devil for all I care. Niyazi, the difference between what humans think they see and what they actually see... Dad, Daddy! Nurse! -Nurse. -Nurse! Nurse! Where’s the nurse? Emergency! Dad’s heart stopped. He’s alive. He’s alive. I’m testing the machine. It’s working. Attached to me it beeps, but attached to Old Man Mort... The guy’s a goner. He’s dead. The guy? He’s your father. We never really had a father-son moment. That’s why I said it. We never had time together, but like they say, his shadow was enough. This will be my corner. I’ll put this right here. Gold. Did you get the news, Mom? You’re crying. The tears won’t stop. What news? Who’s that? Hello? Who’s speaking? Selim, it’s your mother. Hang up, you crone. That money didn’t come easy. What money? The money you’ll ask for. Scavenger! Are you all right? Did you arrive safely? Oh, now you mother me. We’ll talk and then the money will come up. You’ll ask for money, right? Forget about it. Hang up. Leave me alone! Stay strong, Mom. Dad’s passed away. He didn’t even make it a week. Did he get all the money? No, Mom. Did your father marry that woman? -Is the money gone? -No, Mom. Then why do you look sad? If your father died, we’re rich. What are you saying, Mom? Motherhood doesn’t mean working to raise me all those years. Motherhood means giving birth. It’s that simple. The rest is being a babysitter. My mother is Frisky Husniye. Let the woman rest in peace. Don’t be a bloodsucker! Deleting all the numbers isn’t enough. Block them all. “Poor but proud,” we used to say. Now the poor have no pride. That guy’s a problem. Be careful. Right. Now we’ve got him to deal with. Could I ask something? Go right ahead. Since we’re on the subject... you say the inheritance is ill-gotten, so that means it’s not in the bank, right? Where is the money? He died without telling us! The bequest will be read tomorrow after the funeral. That’s all the information I can provide until then. Good day. Yesterday, he signed the documents for the foundation. Our foundation. You’ve got, what, a 10% stake? Right. Our foundation. If the children agree to the terms, within 24 hours we transfer the safe to the foundation. Just look what he did. He got rich because of me. If it weren’t for me, there would be no safe. And yet he hides the money. I’m entitled to it. I think the heirs will agree to his proposal. The safe will belong to the foundation. They’ll reach the right conclusion. There’s no need to worry. It’s not the children that worry me. You don’t know Yakut. Why won’t the tears stop? Stop! Brother, I made up the sofa bed. Sleep there. The guest can stay in your room. Make him comfortable. We need to be comfortable, not him. Is this a hotel? Let’s give him food and drink. Get him drunk. Get him to accept his share. Not split up the inheritance. Oh, my big brother. I fixed everything myself. Hand me the raki. I always wanted a big brother. To protect me. To have my back. You’ll make me cry. Will he ever. Wow. He’s quick on the draw. He’s drinking it straight. But... let me make this clear. We’re drinking to help us think. Don’t go overboard. The funeral's tomorrow. Let’s not stink. So what if we stink? Right? My dad died. Of course I need a drink. It’s how I drown the pain. Don’t judge me. Right? Is what we’ll say. If anyone says anything. It’s more touching when you’re down and out. They’ll think we really loved our father. And the bloodsuckers won’t try to take our money. There’s no need for a DNA test. This S.O.B is our brother. What’s that? No offence to your mother. Okay then. Nobody insults Frisky Husniye. Then let’s drink to Husniye. Cheers. Shall we drink to the taxi stand he’s inheriting? You made the right choice. Lots of money. No risk. There for the taking. Congratulations. They’re still flowing. I can’t stop them. So, tell me. What’s the procedure? Now... here’s what we’re doing, Mom. Watch your mouth! What’s this “mom”? Do I swear at you? Mom, what are you doing? I know you’re hurting. Your grief is still fresh. But he’s our brother. My husband died. I’m in shock. You poor boy. You’re like a son to me. A gift from my husband. You smell like a son. The tears came to my eyes. I’m upset too. But I won’t cry. Dad gave us two choices before he died. The money he earned honestly. Not much, but worry-free. Then there’s the other choice. It could cause a lot of stress... but it leads to a lot of money. Getting money always means stress. Just tell me how much it is. How much money? It’s not that much. A billion dollars, they said. It’s a figure of speech. They were thinking aloud. Just threw out a figure. It’s got to be divided. And there are invoices. -And taxes. -Right, and withholding tax. Mom. Mom. My God. I thought my kids were my trial. But they’re the real test. Why’s she angry? Mom. Get up. We’re going. How did you get down there? Is that cigarette in her mouth a new one? She can’t have thrown one down there and caught it. Your mother’s not normal. What's there to think about? Have you never counted money? Do you need a slap? For that kind of money my Hadji grandfather would burn down paradise. Let’s go tell your uncle your decision. That Saffet! Now I understand what he was up to. He’ll try to grab all the money. What are you talking about? Saffet’s the supervisor. He’s with the corporate lawyer. Maybe they’re working. Your father worked at home twice. That’s how you were born. -Are they gone? -Yes. Look what she did to me! You see what your mother did? It’s dislocated, that’s all. We’ll fix it. Bravo. Is the C key stuck? Straighten up. Is that any way to walk? It’s all your mother’s fault. What a crybaby. Is your back hurt too? Let me have a look. We’ll apply heat at home. I’ll sort it out. L3 has slipped. Why didn’t you graduate? You’re talented. I never finished school, but I understand anatomy. Ten thousand hours of practice makes anyone an expert. I wasn’t born with this knowledge. I learned by making love. I didn’t gawp. I prodded and poked and examined. I’ve got a lot to learn from you, brother. Ten thousand hours? We’ll work together. The man of my house! Even cars have turn signals, but you went to the other side without warning. If only instead of you, God had taken Selim. I can always have another child, but you’ll never come back. Dear congregation, settle down. Life goes on, right? Mom, cry a little. Where are your tears? They dried up. I can’t squeeze any out. I need a refill. Before we hold the funeral for the departed, dear congregation, I am asking: Do you give your blessing to the departed? No. Do you give your blessing? No. Do you give your blessing? No! What’s going on? This isn’t a soccer chant. You sound angrier each time. Does nobody give his blessing? I wouldn’t even give him my milk. Milk? The departed is 20 or 30 years older than you. But he had strange desires. He enjoyed it. I had to stop nursing my baby. I couldn’t keep up with them both. We had a relationship of ill repute. Before we could get married, that fu-- Fudge, she’s saying. Fudge. The departed had children. They should offer their blessing at least before we pray. -Take my blessing. -Take my blessing. What are you looking at? After all, he was our father. You’re his children, too? How many kids did the departed have? There are three of us. When I visited, they gave me ticket number seven. Is that what this 21 is? I got mine online. We’re number one. For shame! The Olympics doesn’t even bring together this many people of different nations. The next level is Judgment Day. Right, Hodja? Dad, what have you done? We can talk about this later. Let’s get the burial done first. Saffet, you rat! You knew all along, right? How many kids are there? Dear congregation. Please! Please! Until we bury the departed, the will won’t be read. Right? Okay. I’ll recite the Kamet. Funerals don’t have a Kamet. Then I’ll warm up the congregation. Dear congregation, we’ll go from Allahu Akbar to Celle Senauk. After the Fatiha, we’ll recite the Kunut prayers. Those who don’t know it can cry out the name of God. Back to you, Hodja. Be quick about it. Look at that. What are you doing? Show a little respect! You asked for this! I won’t perform the service! Hodja. I won’t do it. Manage it yourself. -Hodja. -No way! I won’t perform the service! There goes the inheritance. Where’s it going? No way. Dear congregation, let’s say “Allahu Akbar.” God, don’t test me with your children. They’re your children, aren’t they? Hodja. Hodja. Hey, Hodja. It was big of you to come despite what Erdal did. He’s so sorry. You’re an esteemed person. It's the money, Hodja. That much money corrupts people. They should thank you. Normally, I wouldn’t have come. You apologized, right? I came because decent people like you shouldn’t be wronged. We buried him, brother! Don’t bother with the Hodja. Send him on his way! We’re rich now. Rich! When did you bury him? Like I said, that much money spoils people. You’re such a nightmare! A real nightmare! I’ve lost my faith in humanity! Get away from me! Whatever we do, we better not fall into their hands. They’ll be the end of us. They have no respect for the living or the dead. They’ll bury us standing up at attention, and like that, we’ll wait for Judgment Day. We won’t be at ease until the apocalypse. Imagine that. We’ve never needed unity more than today. What kind of people are they? We’re in trouble. Let’s make the first choice. Let’s take our money and go. We don’t want to deal with them. Don’t be such an idiot. Come on, get going. Do you think they scare me? The mouse born in a windmill does not fear thunder. Come on! Friends, you know why we have gathered. I won’t beat around the bush. Your father left you this safe. Out of the way! What are you doing? Move! It's a room constructed of steel and bulletproof glass. The way to claim the inheritance is to enter the 6-digit code. Allah! Erdal, that’s a projected image. Calm down. Where’s the safe? Tell me quick. No traps. No mind games. That wouldn’t be fair. We’ll finish and go down to the safe. Wait a bit longer. Equal terms. You can compete alone or in groups. Whichever you want. The first one to solve the code gets the inheritance. Why do we need a code? Let’s all get our share and go. The other children agreed to your father’s offer and got their money. You six were too greedy. You wouldn’t settle for less. Your father said, "If they won’t take my offer, may the best one win." Nobody here is any good. The money will go to charity. That’s exactly right. If, within 48 hours, none of you accesses the money, it will all go to the charity chosen by your father. Let me read the will. “My children, greed is in your blood. Do not be upset. I knew this would happen. If you want all the money, then let’s have some fun. The code is contained in these four lines of verse." Listen carefully. "There’s something you have in common They will all join up in Scamander They say beauty is on the inside I say, screw whoever says that!” Me too! Whatever Dad says, goes. Everyone should know their place! That was harsh. What about the riddle? I read it out. Now, solve it. The code is in that poem. He’s cursing in the poem. Where’s the riddle? How long are those legs? The full riddle is here. I swallowed it. I’ve got it memorized. That money will be ours! I made a copy for everyone. You swallowed your copy. You can wait for your copy at home. It was a joke. Why do I do this to myself? I’m my own worst enemy! Let’s go down to the safe. Allah! Quick. -Are you okay, brother? -I’m fine. Erdal, that glass is unbreakable. How can that be? Glass always breaks, stupid! Go for it! What the... Now do you believe us? It’s glass! Why won’t it break? It’s against nature. Get back. Get back! Careful. Did it break? -Brother. -What? It really didn’t break. There’s a grenade in the bus. I’ll get it. There’s no need. I know what’s going on. They put a spell on the glass. There’s no other explanation. Logic can’t explain it. It’s something mystical. Either it’s a spell or... -Genies. -Genies. The brain is a vital organ whose importance is underappreciated. What are we going to do, Saffet? Enter the code on the panel to the left and the door will open. That’s it. How many tries do we get? Does it freeze on three? It’s not a pin code. Why would it freeze? It’s easy then. Stay here and enter numbers starting with 000001. No leaving. No going to the toilet. Shit here if you must. If you fall asleep, I’ll shoot you. At your orders, brother. That’s my boy. Erdal, you’ll never enter enough numbers in two days. Statistically speaking. How do you know the code isn’t five? Have you tried? Maybe he’ll crack it on the fifth try. -Right? -Right. Why do I bother? Right. The 48-hour countdown has begun. What’s that? A hologram? If this hologram appears, it means everyone here has met the first condition. My greediest children, my little darlings. The money’s mine. Nobody else gets it. What makes you think you deserve it? They say I’m a womanizer, but I was searching for myself. That’s why you have so many siblings. Natural selection will do the rest. I’m dead, but I had a wonderful life. I know one of my children is just like me. And the money will still be mine. Screw you. The new “me” will crack the code and collect our money. Don’t forget. Be as greedy, smart, bold and merciless as me. That’s how I got this money. Now, piss off! You troublemakers. That bastard. Hey, lady. Let’s make a deal. About what? You need to be smart to figure out the code. We’ll never manage. We’re better at action and adrenaline. So, let’s join forces. We can blow up the safe and split the money. What do you say? You’re useless. What are you good at? Carrying a gun? That’s a sign of weakness! We siblings shouldn’t be enemies. Are you threatening me? Take it however you want. We’re from the Karakuyu clan! Our fame’s spread far and wide. What have you done! Come on. We’re leaving. You swatted him like a fly. The security camera’s okay. The 33 siblings’ files are here. Do you think it will work? We’ll accuse them of stealing corporate documents. Along with some money, so the case is serious. When should I call the cops? I’ll give them the files, and let you know. Then call the police. How long will they be detained? I’ll do what I can to make it two days. What about Erdal and his brothers? Someone who knifes a window isn’t a threat. It’s enough to eliminate Yakut. Shit! You said you wouldn’t upload it. I wish I'd deleted it. How will this turn out? Can I join you? We’ll talk it over. Don’t bottle it up. I’ve got problems too. Let’s talk things over. I’m fine. I’ll come in soon. I’m your big brother. Let’s have a brotherly moment. Relax. What’s that? Have you eaten roadkill? What have you done? I told you not to come out. I came out here to do it. -Is it shameful? -It’s a sin. I fart, too. But not like this. This is different. You’re not farting. You’re shitting in gas form. You’re making me swallow shit. It’s thick as yogurt! Enough. Stop embarrassing me. Shut up! Doing your outdoor pose, you asked how this would turn out. I thought you had a problem. You’re all the same. -Brother? -Don’t call me brother! Is something wrong? After that fart, how can I think about my problem? I can barely survive out here. Tulin, have we got any yogurt? It’s good for poison. Call the fire department. Damn you! Are you a heathen? I went outside. What more can I do? Am I supposed to do it in the bathroom? Nobody does that. These flowers were white. They’ve gone yellow. You’re a threat to the ecosystem. Damn you! Can we change the subject? My brother has a problem. Let’s listen to him. -What problem? -Not again! I can smell it in my room. Tell us what’s bothering you. Let’s change the subject. Well, I was the victim of a camera prank in Cyprus. That’s fascinating. Send us the video. Right, Mom? It’s not that interesting, but it shows my license plate. Fascinating. Almost the same as mine. Except for that “T”. “T” is mandatory for taxis. The number’s after the T. Let me see. Are your plates the same? 34 SM 041. TSM 041. Could it be... Thank God the subject changed. What’s the line number of that bus driver? Try to remember. Help us, God. Please. All the info is here. God, you’re so fast. I should have wished for something else. Shall I pray for gold? God, give me gold. Give me gold. It’s bus line 41 SM. That’s it. What’s going on? Niyazi, keep your uncle busy. Don’t let him get in the way. Don’t you trust me? I’m going to show you something. What? Have you seen the curtains in Tulin’s room? There’s nothing else to show me? I came here to help you. “Something you have in common” was the line. What about the other brothers? Just a second. The waiter’s café is number SM 41. We all have “SM 41” in common. We found it! Found what? I have the right to know. Look at the carpet. The lace. There’s nothing here to show him. Yakut, those documents are important. I stole them for you. I have the right to know, too. -I’m coming. -He’s coming. Get rid of them. He’s coming. When I said to get rid of them, I meant put them under the cushions or something. What have you done! That would have been logical. I guess I needed some action. Uncle, I destroyed them all. Nobody will find them now. Don’t worry. Right, right. I should never have kicked you. I’ve taken a shine to you. If I’ve been of help, I’m pleased. Now, tonight, I can rest easy. Let me show your uncle out. You must sacrifice a fly to catch a trout. He’s been useful. Now, use your heads. What is 41 SM? Get thinking! Go on, think! “They will all join up in Samandira” went the line. We should look for SM 41 in Samandira. The code is there. Wow. That’s what I already said. Go change your clothes. Don’t make me act like a big brother. Go on, Tulin. So, SP 14. Asli, there’s been a setback. Cancel the police. They’ve solved something, but I’m not sure what. All right. Then it’s my turn, like we agreed. -When shall I get started? -Right away. Our fate is in your hands. Do whatever it takes. I'm sending the most gullible one. Who’s that? It says “urgent.” Are you available? It's urgent. Hello. This is Selim. Selim, hello. It’s Asli, the lawyer. I hope I’m not disturbing you. No, I was stretched out, reading the constitution. We’ve got a lot in common. That’s so cute. Anyway, your file is incomplete. For the legal process, I urgently need a codicil. A codicil? Sure. So that’s what it’s called these days. Nice way to put it. I’m all yours. Damn you. Who are you slamming the door on? Nitwit! Leave us alone. He’s only just recovered. Are you going to kill us? Why would I bother? Stop whining. I came to talk. I brought you some chocolate. Golden chocolate. Show me the way. Nitwit. Get over here. Trying to solve the riddle, huh? Here’s your chocolate. What happened to your finger? Nothing. I fell on it when you threw me in the air. It will be good as new. It's a finger, not a glass, buddy. Buddy? Is what I’d normally say, but if you say otherwise, you must be right. Just what I expected. You’re so weak. Right, we’re weak. It’s not fair! I felt pity for you, and came here to help. Really? If my kids get the money, I’ll get 25%. I propose that you give me 50% to be your informant. I’ll tell you everything they do. For example, my kids solved part one of the riddle. You might want to hear it. Is it a deal? Tell us. It’s a deal! It’s a deal. If you’ll give me a bigger share, why not cut a deal with you? Agreed. There’s no place in business for emotions. Madame, would you mind not sitting like that? I can see your private parts. What are you talking about? You chose black. Lace-edged. Double-stitched. A number one crochet hook was used. Made in China. Please stop it. The effect your sex has on me is so hard to imagine, Miss. Please stop it. Look what we're talking about! If we have a deal, what have they found? What are their plans? SM 41 is what we have in common. Samandira is in the riddle. We’re going there tomorrow to find out what SM 41 is an abbreviation for. The code is there. I’ll infiltrate you tomorrow. Be careful. They mustn’t know that we’re collaborating. Collab... lab... lab. Don’t let on. On... On... On... Let me know about even the smallest development. I’ll go have a look at Samandira. Finish your tea and go home. Come on. Selim. Help me. Sure. Little frog, little frog Where’s your tail? I haven’t got a tail What’s it doing in the stream. Is that frog a maniac? Auntie, where’s my mom? Selim, are you okay? Pull yourself together. Okay then. Kisses. Take care. Should we go to the hospital? You’re starting to scare me. No. I’m coming to my senses. Where are we? Is this Lefkosa? Is that a telescope? It’s a leather chair. Expensive. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Why am I here? I don’t remember anything. ACCESS DENIED Are you wearing camouflage? Is Samandira a religious place? What are you talking about? Aren’t we visiting Dad’s grave first? Why would we? It’s the custom. The morning after the funeral. Are we leaving him all alone? He’s not alone. Don’t worry. The angels are questioning him. There’s an underground party. It’s crowded down there. Don’t worry. Tulin, be sure that Dad would not want us to waste any time in finding the money he cheated and lied for. Why do you think he committed all those sins? Your mother didn’t even listen. She just left. Sorry. I’m going to track down the money too. You’re right. Let’s split up. Tulin, you go to the grave. We’ll join Mom. Say hi to Dad for me. Split up? I didn’t say that. If you need anything... don’t ask us. Pray to God for it. There’s nothing we can do. Come on. At your service. Saffet, mahvet... 41, there you go. I’ve been busy. What? Excuse us. Proceed. SAMANDIRA MOSQUE SAMANDIRA MILK COWS SM 41! The code might be in the envelopes. Run, run! WE ARE GETTING MARRIED! There’s a maniac! I’ll show you! Here, you greedy rat! Close the hood! Young lady, I’m looking for this grave. I lost the way. How do I get there? I’ve just found out. It’s not difficult. “ZM” is for Zincirlikuyu Mezarligi Cemetery. “73” is section “7,” plot “3.” The grave is number 73. The letters are the cemetery. The numbers are the grave location. It’s so simple! Why didn’t you understand? It’s simple. Don’t yell at me. They didn’t teach me to read. It’s not about you, Auntie. Let me kiss you. Thank you. What is it, you useless girl. I’m dripping sweat from running around all morning. Mom, I think I found the code. That’s my girl! Let’s meet at Samandira Mezarligi Cemetery. -In half an hour. -Okay, I’m coming. Be at Samandira Cemetery in half an hour. I solved the code. What would you do without me? Don’t forget. In one hour. The Ministry of Health SM, SM, SM, SM. But there’s no 41. Forty-one. SM 41. Boss. You don’t understand what we’re looking for. What’s that number for? We don’t get it. We couldn’t get into it. What would you do without me? I cracked the code. Be at Samandira Cemetery in two hours. Don’t forget. Two hours. 20 MINUTES LATER SAMANDIRA CEMETERY Mom, is there anything you want to say? Like what? Like whose team are you on? We had a chat before you came. Brother to brother. If Frisky Husniye could see what you’ve done... Husniye can take a look at herself first. You’re a poor excuse for a son. I could make something better out of a lump of dough. Idiot! She’s right. Yakut, you’re getting more and more dangerous. When did you cut a deal with these guys? Yesterday evening. After I saw you off. You’re looking at me like I’ve done something wrong. You have done something wrong. How can you look us in the eye? Son, you’d give me 25%. They’d give me 50%. I guaranteed our family gets something. Is thinking of you a crime? Only a mother would understand. This is all wrong. We’re splitting the money equally. We’re all brothers after all. It’s hard to believe, but you’re right. We’re brothers. I’m going to cry. My brothers. What’s that? Your shirt lifted up. I got goose bumps. All my hair stood on end. On my bottom, too. The hair stood on end. Let’s get the money and I’ll give it all to the doctor and say, "Make me handsome." Make you handsome? Only God can make something out of nothing. A doctor improves what’s there. You’ve got nothing. You're subhuman. I’ve got something on my non-existent mind. Don’t say that. We brothers are splitting everything. What about the ex-wife? She’ll end up with nothing. I’ll slit your throat! Don’t mess with me! Who do you think you are? Mothers build our society. I’ll cut you up... and bury you in prison! Have you no fear of God? O divine justice. If I took 50%, so what? I feel all funny. Okay. We scared you enough. You’ll get a share. We’ll divide the money equally. Really? Why did you unite everyone? The money’s too divided. Sow some discord. Provoke them. Slow things down. You start it. I’ll be right behind you. What’s going on, Uncle? Are you okay? You mixed me up with someone else. We’ll do what we agreed, right? Don’t let them suspect us. You brought picks. Good. Section 4. Plot 1. We’re digging up grave 41. Come on. -There it is. -Over there? -Over there. -Okay. He bought an empty grave. It’ll be easy to dig. I’m getting started. What are you doing? The tip hadn’t touched the earth. If only we’d got in a dig or two. This is all wrong. You can’t dig a grave just anywhere. It’s forbidden. Let me explain. You send the grave deed to the cemetery directorate. You enclose a death certificate for the deceased and they send us a notice, and then we dig the grave. We’re not burying anyone. Nobody died. It'd be easy to get a body. But we’d have to wait. We’re in a hurry. We’ll dig and go. If nobody’s dead, why are you digging? If nobody’s dead, why are you digging? We heard you! Stop repeating yourself. Could you come here for a second? Please. Erdal, go right over there. Go on. Now, explain everything. It’s dog against dog. Listen, brother. I speak plainly. I tell it like it is. I’ll be clear with you. Either I use this pick to dig a grave, or I smash it into your head. I can’t decide which one. I’ll let you choose. Can I tell you a secret? It makes no difference to me. I’ll protect this cemetery even if it costs me my life. My job is my honor. So you decide. -You’re a great guy. -Thank you. Forgive me. I’m going to kill you with this pick. Erdal, is that appropriate language? It’s the only language I know. He’s got high blood sugar. He gets mad easily. Listen, brother. I’ll speak plainly. I tell it like it is. I’ll be clear with you. I’ve got friends in high places... extremely high places. I’ll make you the director of this cemetery. Director through cronyism? You expect me to use my ill-gotten director’s salary to buy food for my child? And then explain to that same child the difference between right and wrong? I won’t do it! How much is a director’s salary? It’s low enough to refuse. Listen. Watch your brother. Now, everyone has their price. Turn a blind eye for five minutes. And I’ll turn a blind eye to this check for 50,000 falling out of my pocket. It went into the grate. And down to the sewer. Your money’s swimming in shit. What? Erdal, run quick! Bring me the pick! Pull up the grate! I lost 50,000! See. It’s gone. That’s what we call haram money. See that? Fifty thousand just disappeared. You couldn’t hold on to it. Why? Because it’s haram. I’m warning you. Never try to bribe another official. It’s a crime. I’ll see you in court. I live for my honor! Fine. But why? You’re the last of your kind. How did you find us? Who lives for honor in this day and age? Look at this nitwit! Turns out he’s honorable! Your money’s in the shit. Exactly! Let me at him! -Let him go! -Stop it! He’s a civil servant. Your friend is lucky. If he’d ripped off a button, he’d get six months. I’m next. You’re a tough nut to crack. You deserve a reward. Listen, handsome. Turn a blind eye for five minutes... and I’ll turn a blind eye until dawn. I’ll make a new man of you. They call me Yakut the Clamp. Maybe you've heard of me. Mother! The money’s spoiled you before you've even got it. Right. Let’s go sort out the permit and come back later. Uncle, what permit? There’s no time. We’ve got friends in high places. We’ll sort it out. Come on. Come on. If we keep insisting, he’ll call the police. I talked about a permit to calm him down. We’ll come at night and do it in secret. I was about to persuade him. You saw the gleam in his eyes. If you think it’s dangerous at night, just say so. Uncle, nothing is more dangerous than losing a trillion dollars. See, I called you "uncle." Don’t make me lose my cool. Fine then. We’ll meet up at night. No way. Come here. Nobody leaves the group. How do I know you won’t secretly dig the grave without us? Why would I do that? It’s a lot of dough. A lot of dough. For that kind of money a mother would sell out her kids. Isn’t that what I just did? Tell me I was wrong. -You were right. -You were right. -I sold you out without mercy. -Right! Zip it! We’re sticking together. We’re all going to my place in the same vehicle. Go to the bus. Get going! Uncle, you’re a thief! You took all our money. I’ve taken a lot of beatings, but nothing like this. Set up the tiles. I’ll be right back. He keeps doing this. I’ll hold the door. Distract them. Don’t let them catch on. What’s with the head wags? It bugs me. Don’t let it. Have you lined up the men? They’ll be at the cemetery gate at midnight. Dressed as security guards. -Their guns won’t attract attention. -Okay. No matter what, don’t let anyone in the... Mom? ...cemetery. If we get through tonight, we’re home free. Mom? What? -Where’s Uncle? -In the bathroom. He’s on WhatsApp. He’s probably texting. Really! He just went offline. I knew it! He heard us. I’m breaking down the door. Wait a minute! Saffet, what are you doing in there? What people do in bathrooms. Saffet, take your time. But don’t squeeze too hard. You might burst a blood vessel. That’s how we lost Huriye’s son-in-law. He died taking a shit. Welcome, Hodja. The living room is over there. Greetings. -Greetings. -Greetings. My condolences. -Thank you. -Thank you. My condolences. Condolences? Us? Pick those up. Who’s playing games here? Hodja, our father died. We’re too full of grief to know what we’re doing. Tulin, what have you done? We didn’t have a service yesterday. I thought while we were all here... Uncle's out of the bathroom. It’s free for ablutions. Ablutions for these two? What happened? Did the messiah come while I was in there? We’ve prayed before. But we’ve never robbed a grave. It will be something new. Or will it be the same as before? Run! The night is long. Stay loose. I’ll pull it off. Leave it to me. Just relax. I am relaxed. You should relax. What’s going on? What do you mean? Hanging to the left. Is that how you want it? Stop mouthing off. We talked about this. I’ll give you more. You’re blurting it straight out. That’s daring of you. Selim, you’re doing it for money. Not for free. Just think of the money. You’ll never get a chance like this. I don’t want it. It's going too far. Some things really are more important than money. Now I see that’s true. What a maniac. He’s trying to get a bigger cut. I’m not falling for that. SAMANDIRA CEMETERY Having fun? Anyone else want to drive? Oh! Hang on. What’s going on? Who are they? Where’d they come from? Are there armed guards at night? We’d better go back. Go back? This was your plan! If they’re armed, so be it. Friends, those armed guys are people... just like you and me. We’re going in there tonight. There’s no other way. Quiet! Good evening. Anything wrong? Buddy, mind your own business. This is my business. I’m the cemetery guard. Who are you? We don’t need you tonight, sweetie. We’re guarding the cemetery. Got a problem with that? You can’t do that. It’s against the rules. Private security requires written permission. Once that’s done, you need to sign the guard duty sheet. Are you going to shut up, or am I going to shut you up? Don’t get the wrong idea, but I’m packing, too. Isn’t that the guard from this morning? It’s getting crowded over there. We should leave. No way. Let’s try our chances. At worst, they chase us. -It’s not like we’ll end up dead. -Let’s go. We could end up dead! Run, run! Did you come back for me? That’s what brothers do, right? If not, tell me. My back’s killing me! Are you okay, bro? Are you? I’m fine. I’m fine, brother. Who the hell are you? Put your hands up! Come here, quickly! Okay, okay. It’s not visiting hours. Come here! The boss doesn’t want witnesses. What’s the problem? I’ll pray at home. And my phone’s not working. Hey! Why’d you shoot me? I was going to pray for the departed. Help me! They’re really shooting! Hey! Put down your gun. We can talk it over. Violence isn’t the answer. Talking solves nothing. Bastards! "Violence isn’t the answer." You’re better than that. Do you want me to die? He’s right. One down. Come on! I shot him down! I really did. Why do you keep moving? You’re losing blood. What are we going to do? We can’t leave them here. Someone will see. We’re digging a grave anyway. We’ll bury them in it. You can’t do that. For burials, you need a permit from the council. Then you can do it. I’m alive. You can’t bury me alive. Put me out of my misery. Or... Or... you could take us to the hospital. Right? Right. No need to die. I can’t go to the hospital. I can’t leave my post. Shut up! Your officiousness is what caused all this. Screw you and your rules! I’ll make a tourniquet. You dig the grave. Then we’ll take them to hospital. Get Uncle and come. Get the shovels and picks! If you’d agreed to my proposal, none of this would have happened. It’s my brothers. I staunched the bleeding. They’re in the bus. We’ve got to drop them off. What are you doing here? You’re bleeding. Go die in the bus! I mean, wait there. I wanted to help. Give me an axe. I’ll dive in. He’s like a virus. You can’t get rid of him. He’s fighting to the last drop of blood. You hear that? Out of the way. -It’s jammed. -Hang on. -Hang on. -Get back. Leave it! I’ll open it. Leave it. It’s all over, huh? You’re holding the code, huh? Shut up. I’m already excited. My legs are shaking. Has anyone got some candy? It’s not clear. It’s written in watercolor or something. Get away! I can’t see it. What does it say? What’s written there? What does it say? Hold it to the light, Mom. -Like this? -Yes. Eight. Then 6. Screw you, Selim! What have you done, Uncle? Why’d you swallow the code? Why’d you do that? He hasn’t got an answer. Just look at that face! The bastard’s jealous! He doesn’t have a share! I kicked him once. He must be getting revenge. What are we going to do? The code’s in his guts. Give me the shovel. I’ll dig it out of his belly. Stop! What are you doing? He’s already wounded. He’s got an explanation. Otherwise, he’d have run away. Give me a hand. She gave him the idea to run. Is she really my daughter? Get away from me. He lost a lot of blood. It’s normal to faint. But he really ran. Let’s carry him away before anyone comes. We’ll find a way to get the code. -Grab him there. -Come on. Hold tight! 102 301 Hello? The first digit is 8, the second is 6. Start with them. ADITI HOSPITAL You can’t do that. This isn’t an emergency. A GP should examine us first. Then we sign in and are admitted. There are rules! We’re treating him. As if he deserves it. I can’t get him conscious. Stop being so stubborn. Let’s slit his belly and get the code. Then we’ll take him to the hospital. He’ll live. I’ve done it before. He’s lost a lot of blood. He’ll die. He’ll live. If he dies, I’ll look after his children. I’ll put them through school. I’ll marry his wife. I’ll change his parents’ diapers. I’ll do whatever you want. But let’s get that code out of his guts. Let Erdal do it! Brother, are you okay? This isn’t like you. He’s a bad influence. I almost followed him to Hell. Do you know why? This monster kept winking at me. It pissed me off. Have you all lost your minds? Lost them completely? Get up, daughter. Listen, Niyazi, join us when you’re ready. Get going. Niyazi, tough times call for tough decisions. We can’t slice him up. Don’t be ridiculous. I’m still human. I can’t do that. Beloved son. What happened to you? What happened, darling? Snap out of it! Beast! We’ve got to get that code! You went to med school. Is there no way? We’ll take our chances. That’s what I want to hear. We’ll give it a try. We’ll give him kerosene to make him vomit. Or give him an enema. That code will come out. Couldn’t we get the hospital to pump his stomach? Without consent, the hospital can’t do a thing. He won’t agree. And we’ll have freed him. How many hours are left? We should have agreed to the terms. I’d own a department store now. But... if we get an endoscopy machine, I can do it here. It’s a high-tech device. Nearly impossible to find. Never mind. Forget about it. Are you saying that if we get that machine you’ll be able to do it? -I’ll get it. -Listen. We need some equipment. -We’ll find it, right? -I’ll get it. Can you get an endoscopy machine? I’ll get it. Do you know what it is? No. There's a million dollars on the line. We’ve got no other choice. Let’s stick to Plan A. Before you get the machine, find me an enema kit and some kerosene. We’ll need them. Okay? Okay. Let’s go. Sit down. They call that a squat. Selim and Tulin should come with us. If just the two of us go, you might try to get rid of us. It’s like a down payment. If you try something funny, they’ll be hostages. Our beggars. She’s coming. Keep calm. What are you doing? Get going! 2 HOURS LATER Is this it? It sure is. But how... We found one in 15 minutes. But it was old. The warranty was expired. This one’s got a two-year guarantee. It can be exchanged. Who gives a shit! Tulin, where are you? We’re coming, Mom. What about the kerosene and enema? Got them, too. We looked for them first. Where are they? Does Tulin have them. No. Fool! Are you stupid? We found them first, and used them to get the machine. Used them? What did you burn with the kerosene? Tell me nobody got hurt. And the enema? Where’d you use it? We saw... such horrors. Things... you can’t imagine. Some guy... begged us to kill him. Then he laughed... I’m... I’m... I’m going to throw up. The things I’ve seen. If only you knew. I think I’m going to be sick. That’s the thanks we get. Was this guy there? I can’t reach him. His phone's off. Maybe he’s in a tunnel. Isn’t that the guy you shot? Let me see. Yes, that’s him. This foreign guy pumped him full of bullets. I followed orders. "Don’t let anyone in the cemetery." That’s not true. It’s also our duty to help and inform visitors. We come in the morning. We give them information. Did we print these brochures for nothing? Why did you shoot him? Ma’am, you’re not wearing disposable shoe covers. We’re in a hospital. There are germs everywhere. See that display behind you? Number three. There are rules. Did he say where he was going? -No. -No. I heard them. I was next to them. They were making a plan. I heard every detail. But I won’t tell you. They weren’t talking to me. I overhead. It would be a violation of privacy. Like snitching. It would break the moral code holding society together. A bus. They got on a bus. One of them was driving. There it is. It’s getting closer. Got it! The traitor opened his eyes! What do you mean? There’s a tube in his mouth. When you got the code, he opened his eyes. Are you crazy? Those pills would knock out a horse. You stopped us so you’d get the money, right? Traitor! Talk! You conspired, right? Talk, or I’ll strangle you! You’re making me crazy! See that tube? What do you think I’m doing? He’s unconscious. I extracted three bullets. It was a muscle twitch. He’s out cold. He can’t open his eyes! What do you mean? He’s crying. See those tears? Are you sure he’s out cold? What? I don’t get it. His body is asleep. But his soul is at battle. Who’d stoop that low for money? Everyone. I don’t blame him. I’d do worse. Way to go! Give it to me. I’ll swallow it! Run. We’re going. Go, go! Run, run! Niyazi, are we leaving Uncle? Who gives a shit about him? Come on. We found it! You go. I’m taking Uncle to hospital. Take pity. Tulin, are you out of your mind? You’ll miss out on the inheritance. Is he worth it? Why would that happen? You’ll give me my share. You’re not that much like Dad. What’s the code? We should have looked. So you could tell you your man at the safe? Forget about it. I saw you phoning him. -That’s a lie! -Go on. Go on. 860 289 Out of the way! Useless. We found the code. You found it? Praise God. 860 289. Did I read it right? Check it. It’s blurred. Exactly. 860 289. What kind of luck! ACCESS DENIED What a relief! I mean... Mom, enter it backwards. Then it will work. Tell me. 9 8 2 0 6 8. ACCESS DENIED What’s going on? We found the code. What else can we do? Please check it again. Do you see anything different? Here. My blood sugar's dropped. I've broken out in a cold sweat. If that door doesn’t open, I’ll die on the spot. The numbers are right. It’s smeared, but that’s right. You’re supposed to be smart! You wanted the machine? I got it! You solved everything else, so solve this, too! What did I do to you? Why are you choking me? I didn’t solve anything. The others did. I’m an idiot, too. A real idiot. Tulin solved everything. Tulin. That’s right. Mom? Let’s call Tulin. She solved everything. She’ll solve this, too. Let’s find Tulin. Yes, Mom? The code’s wrong? God is great. They couldn’t open it. The patient’s in shock. We must operate! Your brother’s sending a photo of the code. 860 289. What’s going on? Is it your school number? What should we do? Should we add your birthdate and divide by five? Should we form a triangle? What? How would I know? If you don’t, who will? Solve this like you solved the cemetery. Mom, that was luck. You can do it. Hey, don’t bury me next to him. Find me a different grave. Don’t say that. Calm down. Let me think. We’ll solve it. You say you can do it. That’s my girl. Theng you. "Theng?" Is it tenk, or tank? You’re trying to say "thank." I’ve never done it before. This is the first time I’ve thonked someone. My mouth won’t say it. Let’s find that code. Enough already! 860 something, right? Excuse me. What’s written here? 860 289. The difference between what humans think they see and what they actually see... Dad really was searching for himself. He was color blind, too. ACCESS AUTHORIZED What? Huh? It’s opening. -Out of the way! -Out of the way! Way to go! Open up! That’s it. We got it! What’s this? The safe is empty. Screw this world! Mom, your hair’s gone white. You’ve aged all of a sudden. My left arm’s tingling. I think it’s a heart attack. He’s going to kill us all. But we opened the safe. Maybe they’ll give us what was first offered. Let’s go see the lawyer. She’s with Uncle in the hospital. Come on, quick! Run! Run! If you were searching for yourself, it can’t be Tulin. You can fool everyone. But not me. There must be a clue. There must be. You didn’t wear a wedding ring. You’re allergic to gold. Just like me. "They say, beauty is on the inside. I say, fuck whoever says that." The safe is made of gold. Congratulations! I knew you’d do it. I can rest in peace now. You’ll continue where I left off. It’s me you were searching for. Why are you surprised? You’re the same as me, Niyazi. You used your siblings. You’re merciless. Like me. You’re greedy. Like me. Now, listen carefully. If you want to surpass me, here’s some golden advice. Don’t get anyone’s blessing! Just take what you want! Take what you can, and never give! If you must help someone, do it in secret. If they think you’re good-hearted, they’ll want your money! Use an iron fist. Make them fear you! Go to the devil, they say. The devil doesn’t bother with the poor! Be like me, Niyazi. I’d rather die. Erect a huge statue to me. Have it put on a busy street. In Bakirköy, Kadiköy or Besiktas. Replace the bull statue in Kadiköy with my statue. Let them see what a real bull is. Park on the sidewalk. Cut in line. Pay minimum wage. Don’t pay social benefits. Cheat in games. Hire a snoop. Place bets. There’s a lot of money in gambling. Troll women on Twitter. Watch pirated copies of movies. Download them from Torrent. Be like me, Niyazi. Be just like me. Be just like me... 2 YEARS LATER These properties appreciated 30% in two years. Invest in property. Don’t, Madame. I suggest a triple interest system. Interest rates are high, Madame. I propose a bundled package. Foreign currency, bonds and stocks. The decision is yours, Madame. The best financial advisors in the country have failed to persuade me. I think the best... is gold. It keeps going up. I’m making money where I sit. Why’s it so empty here? Uncle Saffet. Uncle Saffet. The sales report shows we’ve had a record month even though the mall is empty. You’ve sold everything. Supervisor, I got ambitious. But why? I donated air conditioners to all the local paupers. None of them come to the mall. They’re sitting at home, cool. I’ve collapsed capitalism, but I can’t control you. I’m your uncle. Don’t upset me. And your brothers won’t answer my calls. Are the rumors true? Is there another safe somewhere? Is there? To leave my daughter alone, I’ll give you 50,000. I’m not biting. I don’t need it. Money’s dirty. Don’t you know that? Shame on you. Well, then... I apologize. I got you all wrong. Right. Are your intentions serious? You really don’t get it. I’m saying 50,000 isn’t enough. I’m not poor anymore. I’ll settle for 300,000. No bargaining. Be glad I’m now doing this as a hobby. Hand it over. I’m in a hurry. Drop me off as we pass the cemetery. The vulgar bastard. He brought that chunk of gold wrapped in newspaper. -He should have used a box. -You’re going senile. He has no right to be rich. He has the right to be poor. God, you know best. God, make him poor. We’ll be poor, too. That’s all I ask of you. Bye-bye. Take care. How do prayers end? -Amen. -Amen. Dear Mother. My beloved. My rose. My precious. How cruel. Fate separated us. Never did I see your face-- This isn’t working. I can’t do it. I can’t cry. I don’t feel anything. We never had a mother-son moment. That’s the wrong Husniye. Yours is two gravestones down. I’m five minutes late and I find him weeping in front of the wrong Husniye. Now, that’s more like it. Dear Mother. My beloved. My rose. My precious. How cruel. Fate separated us. Never did I see your face-- Nope. It’s not happening. I don’t feel anything. Without a mother-son moment, there’s nothing. You did what you could. Don’t be upset. Erdal, forgive me. I had no idea surgery had advanced that much. It’s funny. Can’t they do anything for your voice? They can, but I ran out of money. Now I’m handsome, but I’m still poor. Erdal, stop following us around. There’s no second safe! It’s just a rumor. You don’t get it! So be it. I’m still hanging out with you. You'll buy me food, so I don’t go hungry. Come on. He thinks being better-looking makes him funnier. It doesn’t work. Erdal, if there’s another safe, let’s get you Turkish lessons. Get him Cypriot lessons. Kissing a grave? It’s not hygienic. Show some self-respect, and respect for the dead. This is wrong. A grave shouldn’t open when rubbed. It’s against the rules. I need to write this up.
