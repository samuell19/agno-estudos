[chimes] How did we get so afraid of birth? How did we get so that we have millions of women now on this planet who think that they're gonna get through birth more easily if it's surgery? And we've got a lot of young women now who think that pregnancy and giving birth the old way is gross. ♪ Is there anybody here who was not born of a woman? Okay. So I don't see any hands up, okay, so we're still in the same universe. ♪ We feel like we're an order of spiritual revolutionary lay free midwives. And we feel that the sacrament of birth belongs with the family and that in this last fifty or sixty years it's been more usurped by what we feel is basically a profit-oriented hospital system. ♪ One thing that um, me and the other midwives did recently in addition to baby delivering is that we put together this book called "Spiritual Midwifery". We wanted to get some of that knowledge out of what it's like when a community of as many people as we are, what you learn out of that experience. ♪ We feel like that there's gonna be a certain number of kids born anyway, let's get off doing it. ♪ Baby. Gorgeous. This is amazing. That wasn't too hard. ♪ ♪ I can't walk 'cause it's just very... Right. That baby is very low. He's very low or she's very low, yeah. Go ahead, Ina May. She can hardly walk. Well, I believe it! Are you gonna help Ina May? Yeah, she's all ready for the measuring, yeah. Baby's sunk down in there. Uhhuh. Yeah, right there, like, oh God. Okay. What did you get, Adeline? Okay, so I don't know what she has been measuring, but she's about 37. I think that's 'cause the baby's so low, it's not that the baby's so small. It's a very normal size baby. Sounds excellent. About 148. Tell baby, "Hurry up and come out. So we can see you, baby." If you want the baby to come today, though, you'd probably be wise to do a lot of squats. Oh, yeah. Basically you just go down and then you go up and then you go down and then you go up, then you go down, then you go up. Why don't you do that three hundred times? Three hundred times! And we'll hope your legs are not too sore to give birth. I know! A midwife means "with woman". And so it's the woman that stays with the woman when she's having a baby. Midwives have existed as long as we know. They predate doctors. But this profession is in danger of being wiped out ah, by the ever increasing caesarean rate. Which is rising all over the globe. One woman in every three who's pregnant in the U.S. today will have a caesarean section. In China it's approaching fifty percent, and in private hospitals in Brazil it's ninety-five percent. If nobody has labor there'll be no need for a midwife and a lot of knowledge will be lost and a lot of surgery will be done. ♪ I was born in Marshalltown, Iowa. I was really lucky that my mother didn't scare me about birth when I first became curious about it. My mother said "A lot of people yell and scream, but it's really not necessary." So I thought, "I guess birth is kind of a test. Kind of courage is required." My first birth, I was ready to go to a family doctor because I didn't know there was such a thing as an obstetrician. But a friend convinced me that I should go to an obstetrician. And the obstetrician, I didn't like him that much, but I thought I'd better tell him before I had the baby that I didn't want anesthesia. That was just sort of a last minute thought. And I'll never forget his response, he looked at me like, "Oh, no. You're gonna have a forceps delivery." A what? A forceps delivery? Why? ♪ The blade is attached to the shank at a forward angle. This angle tends to correspond to the angle of the pelvis and is known as the pelvic curve. The obstetrician believed that every first birth should be forceps. And told me that my baby would likely get brain damage if not. Didn't make much sense to me. That nature would waste all first borns and give them brain damage just because they were the first one out, I just didn't believe that. But how do you argue with a doctor? My strategy, see I thought "There's a way around this." And I thought, "I'll just be so good that I will have some freedom." I was real quiet and I didn't complain and I kind of put up with the examinations and the enema and the shaving and all that. Then when, suddenly, people show up in masks and start not talking to you and they start tying down hand and feet and what kind of movie am I in here? They took me into what looked like a medieval torture chamber, and then big episiotomy, forceps, and all of this and pulled my baby out and then, you know, I saw this bloody thing being carried away on newspaper. They didn't let me look at my baby so when they finally brought her to me a day later I thought, "No, she's not mine." Actually, she was. But I didn't recognize her and that was very disturbing. So I think that that was a pretty strong lesson in how you can take somebody who's happy about being pregnant, well geared up to do it, and then you can destroy their confidence. And when you're a mother you want to feel confident. So if they take it all away from you then where do you get it? How do you get that back? How do you, you know? So that became the central challenge of my life. I think it's kind of amazing that in all of the medical books and the text books that get written about birth there's nothing about a special energy that surrounds birth. And yet, to me, that seemed like the central thing. I felt like I was doing something sacred. And I was surprised that people that were supposedly taking care of me, treated me like I was somebody who'd done something wrong. I'd been married for seven years. I expected to be treated well. And I actually wasn't, there wasn't any kindness in it. What if that was just sort of like rule number one? Be nice. How much would that change what happens in maternity wards if that two word thing were taken to heart? A beeping machine might make some people feel more relaxed who are in the risk management department, but it does not comfort the woman in the way that a loving and compassionate human presence does. Could you imagine obstetricians singing? "Let's try a song before we cut. You have the best vagina I've ever seen. Your pelvis is without com-- you know, comparison. I mean, you, I'm so jealous of your husband." If that sort of stuff started, I mean... What would happen? The woman break out laughing in surprise and a certain percentage of 'em would dilate and push the baby out just from the hormonal change that would take place. I don't know how many. I can only speculate. But that's something my intuition tells me. [applause] ♪ [hammering] ♪ Thanks. I'm trying to hang up Ina May's honorary PhD. And it says "H-O-N" after it and in Tennessee that's pronounced "hun". As in, "Hello, hun". That looks pretty good now. We've been together since '68. And ah, so that's gettin' on to, well, we're past forty years, I guess. He had some powerful women in his background and so he thought women were supposed to be uppity. And so he encouraged uppitiness, I'll say, and that was a great relief for me, actually. I didn't like being held down. Would you like a sandwich? After I got my bachelor's degree I went to Malaysia in the Peace Corps. And I was there for two years. I was married to my first husband at the time. ♪ That was actually where I was getting the early news from the Vietnam War and was excited to see young people, for the first time, manifesting some power in the world.

In my last semester of teaching I didn't exactly get fired, I just got too weird to get rehired by the time my contract was expired. And my old creative writing teacher just put it in a nutshell. She said, "You have gone too far". Don't let your college interfere with your education. College folks tend to have mass produced minds as alike as a bunch of Chevrolets. Experimental colleges were happening at that time. And so I went and talked to this guy that I'd like to have a place to talk and he said, "Well, Monday night is open." But eventually started getting quite a few people. ♪ We were a bunch of the more intellectual acid taking populations of San Francisco. We were taking a lot of psychedelics. Which can give you a spiritual experience. ♪ People were spiritually seeking. I mean, that was a big part of what was going on. We were hugely ecumenical. And we knew swamis and yogis and Zen masters. Religions only seem different when you deal with retailers. If you deal with wholesalers you'll find them very much alike because they're all coming from the same distributor. My first impression of Stephen was that he wasn't afraid. I was finding that I had a strength in me, I knew I was good for something, and being encouraged to reach for that was a very big thing for me. There was a convention in San Francisco of preachers who had come to this convention to discuss the hippies, they'd come to San Francisco to find out what it was about 'cause it started to happen in the small towns. And so I got to talk to them. These ministers liked what he said so much that they got together among themselves and said, "Why don't we organize a speaking tour since they already live in a school bus?" A lot of us said, "Well, can we come with you to go around the country and talk about nonviolence?" So that's how the caravan really started, It was very spontaneous. A bunch of us on you know, trucks or bread vans or school buses and we became a village on the road. There were a few of us that were pregnant and that's where I wanted to be. And so I kinda talked my husband into getting a bread truck and, you know, we went along on the caravan. ♪ I think the people that were with us on the caravan, those who were pregnant had already formed a little bit of a culture. There were a number of women that had had their babies at home and we were sharing birth stories because I found the first empowered-looking women my age were these women. We were parked in Evanston on the campus of Northwestern. And Stephen was about to go in and speak to an auditorium of three hundred people. There was a knock on the door and this kind of excited looking young man comes in, I didn't know him well. And he was in the class. "Stephen, can you come help me? My wife is in labor and she's gonna have the baby." Why did they ask Stephen? I think because he wasn't scared of anything, it seemed, but I could tell that Stephen didn't know what to do and so I said, "I'll go". I stopped and got my friend Pamela. I was pregnant and I wanted to help some of the other ladies that were pregnant, too, on the caravan. Once I was helping women, I fell in love with women. Like that first lady. When she looked into my eyes, you can't help but love someone, you know, who's working that hard and putting out great, pure effort to have a baby. And it was a beautiful birth. I was on cloud nine. Just seeing the power and the beauty of that woman showed me something that has never left. I knew that was what I was meant for. It must have been about three weeks out that I went into kinda early labor. Somebody started to read, well, what do you do if the baby turns blue. And somebody else who, actually, later became a doctor, said "Don't, no, don't read that because if we read that it might happen". I didn't have enough gumption to pull it back and say, "That's superstitious" and read um, and um, so when the baby was born and didn't breathe nobody knew what to do. Faye Lee ran into Stephen's bus and her look, the look on her face was all he needed and he came over, he had been a medic in Korea, and he came in and did mouth-to-mouth and I... I'm still grateful to Stephen and it's a lifelong gratitude. ♪ For me that was a very, very big lesson in responsibility. ♪ You don't need to do that one. There's nothing in there good. But the petunia... That poor little thing needs help. ♪ ♪ I'm having twins and so I'm looking into options. The Farm has been recommended. If you can give me a call back...

Good. [pained breathing] Ohhh, ohhh. That's the baby's head. Yes. There's several things happening. It's like, this is the most pain I've ever felt before and this is the best I've ever felt. It's a lot about the hormones. Getting close to the end of labor your progesterone levels are high and your estrogen levels go up almost a thousand times what they usually are. Now there's oxytocin in there, too. Oxytocin is the hormone that you get when you make love. It's a hormone that happens when ah, when you have orgasm, and it's the hormone that you have at birth. In fact, that's when levels are higher than they'll ever be any other time in your life. So if you're having a baby and you're complaining and going, "Oh, this is awful, ah, I can't do this, ow, take it away," this is gonna block some of that oxytocin. You're not gonna get the full effect of that oxytocin. If you're laying there and going, "Ah, ah". Now during the rush, yeah, during the rushes it's gonna be hard. You have to breathe through it. And then, after the rush is over, then your body can relax and you can enjoy this marvelous wonderful feeling that you have pushing this baby out. Is it okay to push now? Think so. Don't push heavily at first, just start to do it real gradually. Okay. [moaning] Good. Head's in the birth canal. It's okay, you guys. This is the way you all came out. Gonna be real soon now. Great.

Oh, baby. You'd probably like to see your mother, wouldn't you? Oh, sweet baby. All I knew is when I pushed that baby out it was the best feeling I could ever imagine. It felt so good that about an hour after the baby was born I said, "I wanna do that again." Ina May said, "Let's wait a while, okay?" Robin, what are you doing? You want some attention or what? Hello, Robin, hi, girl. Hello, girl. She's thirty-some years old. And a cute butt for that age. ♪ We got back to San Francisco after the caravan. The scene which was going decadent when we left, was way far decadent. And there was cocaine and heroin and alcohol and money and guns. The whole hippie movement had really kinda turned sour and we wanted to differentiate ourselves from a lot of that, the really crazy stuff that was going on. To, like, leave your bread truck and go rent an apartment and go back to your ordinary life when we had become a village on the road seemed not the right thing to do. So we decided to buy land. But the land in California was so expensive. Stephen's bus pulls up, he jumps out of his bus, jumps onto our bus and says "What do you think about Tennessee?" And John, how was one of the guys on our bus, said, "Do we have time to do the dishes?" And he said, "A week, we'll give you a week." ♪ The prospect of three hundred hippies descending on a small town ordinarily might frighten many of the local residents. But the hippie caravan that traveled recently from San Francisco to Nashville, there was a difference. We decided on Tennessee because this was a place where people were friendly.

And that you can't put somebody outside while there's a roof to put somebody under. At the peak, 73 people lived in this house. When we moved in a few years later we had 58 people. Twenty-eight of them were kids, and we lived with two midwives so we had a birthing room that had a turnaround of approximately every six to eight weeks. The midwives were such an integral part of the community. We were all young families having babies and this was a life and death thing living way back in the woods like this. We prioritized the midwives. They were the ones that made sure that we had a vehicle running even it was and old, beat up truck. Somebody would go to the motor pool and work on it at night so the midwives could jump in the truck and go down any of these rocky roads and deliver a baby at any hour. How many people live on The Farm? Okay, right now there's about 120 residents and we all pay dues into The Farm. We own the land in common, but we all own equity in our own homes. How many births do you do in a month? Probably four to eight births a month. There's seven of us. Now, Ina May's traveling a lot. At least half of our practice is Amish, maybe more. So they're local. And then people come up from Alabama. Right now Alabama has a law that makes it illegal for midwives to practice and they will put you in jail down there. So those women come up here. The families come about three weeks before their due date and stay anywhere from three to five days. We just had a family that stayed for a month after. They were from Cairo, by the way, they came over from Cairo to have their baby. That's awesome. -Pamela? -Yeah? How, emergency services, if you needed them, what happens? We get 'em in about 15 minutes. But um, we transport before it's an emergency. Right. Yay! You know? We don't wait. Right. Yeah. This is our Tower Road cabin. This is the cabin the fir-- We built this cabin in 1971. We've delivered about five hundred babies here. It's rustic. We're getting ready to do some upgrades on it. A lot of people want to have their baby here because of the history that's here and because of the beautiful pinewoods right in back of you. Okay, say, "Hurry". Hurry! Okay, one more. In order to have midwives I trained them. And I got my pick from several hundred women. I could recruit somebody and say, you know, "I'd like you"-- I wouldn't say, "I want you to be my midwife" but that was sort of my criteria. I've learned from books, I've learned from doctors, I've learned from midwives. But I find that a lot of the stuff I've learned by listening to women and allowing myself to be instructed by women. We were actually making our own culture about birth in which fear was not gonna be a big part. If a woman's afraid she won't be relaxed so you kinda go, "What's gonna work with her? Am I going to help her relax physically? Am I going to help her relax by showing her a technique of breathing more slowly and more deeply, which is a big one. Or am I just going to help her laugh? [belches] [all laughing] In one case I realized that I was dealing a woman whose baby was coming fast. She needed to relax fast or she was gonna get a big tear and she was gonna have a lot of pain. And I thought, "Hey, she's a singer. If I got her to sing she'd relax." And that was just an idea that occurred to me, I grabbed it, she did it, and it worked. "Do not hold the mother's legs together to delay delivery." Labor is divided in three stages. Ina May was pretty intrepid and brave and I learned a lot from her. She was my teacher. She, you know, she was learning all the time. Everyone was learning. We, we just started out on a wing and a prayer in my opinion. I would take responsibility for sterilizing the birthing packs which really meant we had sheets and towels and instruments all wrapped up in multiple layers of paper bags and roasted in the oven for like, on low heat for like, five or six hours. So I went to a lot of births before I ever started delivering babies. After about six months of just helping out any way I could, they called me and said would I like to come to a birthing. I was the first one there and I just helped her through each contraction and each rush, we called them "rushes". It really makes a huge difference having someone there that is willing to look you in the eyes and breathe with you. I started just holding the flashlight so they could see and then they started asking me to come and teach me how to check dilation so that I could set with somebody during labor. At the time when I started practicing we also had two doctors on the farm as well as an ambulance. We had oxygen and pitocin and epinephrine. At deliveries we were really set up. There we were with life and death situations trusting each other. It was a wonderful thing and it was a really wonderful way to have a baby. [phone rings] I'm doing it. Yes. Not by myself at all, I have lots of help. Lots of midwives and friends and everything. Right, it's almost here, I'll call you back when it's here, okay? Okay, I love you. Up here is sumac. Right up there, see, with the berries? And you can put them in a big pot and boil it up and it makes a red tea, make jelly out of it. The Indians used to use this for birth control. Queen Anne's Lace. You have to be careful because it looks a lot like hemlock. So you have to really know what you're picking. So now we're going down into the meditation meadow and this is where we used to meditate. On Sunday mornings we did sunrise services and we still have women's circles down here. We brought a pregnant lady up here one time and she was just ready to deliver and she had some issues, you know, that she hadn't brought out, some abuse issues, and we got up this far and she says, "I need to talk". And she talked, you know, she told us about what she had that was bothering her, and she went into labor the very following day. And sometimes those kind of things can kind of hold back labor. I discovered that they had at the medical library old books that they sometimes wanted to get rid of. I went, "Oh, let me at it" because I've always loved old books and you can get some very good descriptions of how to do a breech delivery from an older book, much better descriptions than you would get from a modern book. They had nice drawings. Here's one, "Painless Child Birth" by J.H. Dye M.D. Buffalo, New York, 1888. Is pain necessary? And he says, "No" so he essentially agrees with me. Here's another doctor who published in early twentieth century. Alice Stockham. She advised women to not wear corsets because corsets don't allow you to breathe freely. She advised you to walk. She advised you to eat vegetables, eat a good diet. So she very much um, believed in birth, in the abilities of women in the same way that we do today. So she's pretty cool. This one's kind of interesting. This is the 16th edition of "Williams Obstetrics". This is the most used obstetrics text book. And if you look up in the index, "Chauvinism, male, voluminous amounts, pages 1-1102". The story is that one of the editors' wives... ...slipped that one in there. ♪ All right, now on "Morning Magazine" I'd like you to meet two very interesting people, Stephen and Ina May Gaskin. Each of them have written a book and I don't know quite which book to talk about first. Ina May, yours is called "Spiritual Midwifery" or midwifery and you are a midwife. "Rendered Infamous" is the name of your book, Stephen. I am rendered infamous. You have been rendered infamous, have you? I think the last time we talked we established the fact that both of you live on a community called The Farm down in Tennessee. We're, I think, the largest alternative directed community in the United States. And we do all of the normal services you would find in a small village of a thousand people. Our book publishing company's one of our cottage industries, how we make it. Somebody got an inheritance and we said, "Well, we should do something with that that would maybe potentially earn us something. So why don't we buy a printing press and make a book about what we're doing?" 'Cause we were all excited. This came out 1974. So the first edition of "Spiritual Midwifery" was actually 1975. ♪ And so how that started was that women themselves wrote their birth stories. And when I read them I thought, "Wow this is good writing." ♪ All I remember is us going out to Ina May's and sitting on her bed for hours and hours and hours and telling stories and writing. Then we took our idea to the women in the community and said, "Write your birth stories". So it wasn't just the midwives, it was a whole community of women and all of us were realizing you could actually give birth on a farm with no running water and no electricity and everything would be okay. And, of course, we were right next to this Amish community who'd been doing it for several generations. And I believe it was Stephen who said you have to actually write about what you the midwives do that's special. How do you prepare, what equipment do you have, what are the safety factors and so forth? We felt like this was spiritual, what we were doing, this was the spiritual beginning of every family. ♪ We chose a great art director and we had a whole room full of artists at work. ♪ The artist that drew this picture was at my daughter, Sally's birth. And it was the center foldout of the original "Spiritual Midwifery". ♪ I like that, let me see. ♪ So that's Ann. I led Stephen by the hand after her birth. He couldn't see two inches in front of him. So I took him by the hand and led him, that's the only reason I was at that birth. I really had no, I mean, yeah. And we went through one phase where for some reason it was more spiritually evolved not to wear glasses. -And so... -It was-- I drew that picture. Count yourself fortunate you weren't on the road with us at that time. Oh, good, Cara. Oh well, I caught that. Oh, I took that photo. While my midwife was checking my dilation. ♪ There are some lulls in between when you can do anything you want and we were just yakkin' and I grabbed the camera. I'm checking her and she's opening, she's opening, she's opening and she's taking my picture while she's doing it. Yeah. ♪ Yup, that summer day. ♪ And then I think I took that photo a little while later 'cause that's who was born. The response was enormous. I mean, the printing presses started running 24 hours, seven days a week. And we still couldn't keep up with it. Couldn't print fast enough. And there was that thirst. I mean, it wasn't just a few hippies that were interested in, in better birth. I mean, it was all kinds of people. Women were tired of going to the hospital all over the country. One of our couples went to the hospital handcuffed because they didn't want to be split up. At the time they were making the husbands wait in the waiting room while the women had her baby. And we though, "Nuts to that" you know? "He helped me get this baby in here, why should he go somewhere else?" ♪ We delivered babies for people from our own community, but then lots of people came to us from other places around the country because there weren't very many options at that time. There were some months where we had thirty babies in a month. "Spituele Verlos-kunde" is Dutch and "Pateria Espiritual"in Spanish, this is recently printed in Argentina. And then in German they had to put it into two books 'cause German words are long. The book in Dutch, um, I was told that a doctor made it part of the curriculum, curriculum for the midwifery course 'cause she said what we did here was authentic midwifery. Bear left. Kilpeck. Kilpeck. Kilpeck Church. Do you want-- Yeah, you skipped a sign. Yeah. There's our sheela. So we've got all kinds of faces looking down. Oh, look. Cute little pig, actually. Oh, here she is, here she is. Wow. She's a good size and she's so cute. And she's the one who was described by the Victorian men as the fool trying to tear his heart out. Men of great imagination. Oh, how beautiful. The first figure on the apse is a sheela na gig, either a Celtic fertility symbol or a warning against the sins of the flesh. I put the image of the Kilpeck sheela in my book because I thought "Ah! That would be so good to take to a birth to show a woman what she's capable of. It would take away a lot of fear". And I learned that actually from a woman who was having her first baby and the baby was breech. In this case coming butt first with his feet up by his ears. And she was a bit afraid. When she was in labor then I noticed she star-- just started to push the baby and he wasn't really pressing her open yet, but she was already huge. She looked like she'd have seven babies already and here was this first time mother showing me something I'd never seen before and I'd been at more than a thousand births. So I made a note in my head, I'm gonna ask her how she did that. And she says, "Well, every time I pushed I used that mantra you gave me". And I said, "I didn't know I gave you a mantra, what, what was, what do you mean?" Well, she said "We were at the swimming hole and I was worried and you said 'You're gonna get huge' and every time I pushed I thought 'I'm gonna get huge'". And I thought, ah, visualization. Powerful. I'd like to welcome Ina May. You've been an inspiration to a generation of childbirth educators in this country. And whenever anybody I know gets pregnant and they say, you know, "Tell me a book I need to get," I say, "Spiritual Midwifery" because I thought if somebody read that book they would realize actually women had an innate ability to give birth. So without any more ado, I welcome Ina May. [applause] So we'll take up sphincter law. I've always assumed that the cervix behaves like a sphincter. Even though technically speaking it isn't, exactly, but there's the anatomical definition. The ring shaped muscle that surrounds a natural opening and it uh, we have many sphincters. But there are basic, basic facts and behaviors of sphincters, ah, they're shy. That's why you have doors on toilets. They don't open well while being observed. You, how many of you have children? Many of you. So when your toddler goes over in the corner in the morning and is very, very quiet you know what's going on, don't you? So, I mean, they don't have to be taught to seek privacy, it's instinctual. Now let's say you're in the toilet and you're about halfway through a poo and the fire alarm or the bomb alarm or something goes off. What happens? Closes, doesn't it? And what are we afraid of, you know, with breech they're so afraid that the baby's head gets caught in the cervix. Well, my observation is if you're calm, and then trust in your body, you stay open. But if somebody comes in and scares the hell out of you, you know, and so for me the way you protect and keep a breech birth from going awry is you have a very fierce midwife or doula or husband that will keep intruders out of the room from disturbing the birth. Through the '80s and '90s we had people coming here from all over the U.S. because as the older doctors that were familiar had been taught how to deal with breech birth were retiring or dying off, nobody was learning it in the medical school anymore. How could you dumb down your profession? Well, I found out it wasn't even the decision of the professional organizations for the doctors, it was actually insurance companies that were dictating this to them. For breech birth with the head coming out last you have a time limit. So you need to get the baby's head out within five minutes or so after the rest of the body comes out. And so it's a lost art. This is for calming the baby, you'll continue to see that dark brown, black tarry stuff and it's fine. Okay. Just means the baby's breech. Sometimes a baby will turn during labor. Now what happens if you've never seen a breech birth and you haven't even seen it well described in your text book? Panic. Panic is exactly what you don't need when you have a sudden diagnosis of a breech birth because the panic on the part of the doctor and the midwife will scare the woman and the sphincter law kicks in. And so the baby would either, can get caught, in fact, the head actually can get caught if the cervix closes round it. Well, that's the ultimate nightmare and we've never had that happen. We've always kept the room really calm. Brings it on, yeah? That's the way, you gotta pass through this place. Time to check your dilation. It's wonderful. Water bag's moving down, beautiful, hun, it's coming. Curl your head forward. You're doing beautifully. Your time is getting close. Let's get him now. Oh. Ouch! It's okay, it's okay, baby.

I've not yet met a birthing mother who's tried that but I think it would be a great song to speed labor along a little bit. My next kid. Soft. We freeze 'em and in the middle of winter we have these nice blueberries. We also eat a lot right now. In fact, you can eat as many blueberries, here, let me give you a bowl of blueberries. Here, I'll pick out the best ones. Blueberries through winter. My nearly forty year career in birth has really demonstrated to me how birth after birth after birth after birth after birth worked. But, you know, 180-some before I had a c-section so that taught me it worked, that there was nothing wrong with the American woman's pelvis and she didn't grow too big a baby for her body. But I also knew from my study of obstetrics in the U.S. that you can do too much of intervention and now you can make it dangerous. The number of women who die during childbirth in America is increasing. California reports that it tripled in the last ten years. And it crosses social and economic lines and raises questions about some caesarean sections. The causes are complex. Sometimes a caesarean is necessary. This is always gonna be true. And you will find no midwives that will ever say we should do away with obstetricians. Yeah, sometimes you want a hospital and you want a c-section now and then. You don't just do it to everybody. And see, that's where I think the danger's come in. Is when you go-- when you get preemptive about it. Because we might need that let's just go right there. To me that's what you're doing when you have a scheduled cesarean for no good reason, for a non medical reason. That's trying to make it be that major abdominal surgery isn't dangerous. Of course it's dangerous. The same goes for induction. Farmers would never do that with valuable animals, you wouldn't, you know, induce a mare's labor, you wouldn't induce an elephant's labor. I mean, or like, try it. You wouldn't do that because things are so apt to go wrong. Each one of these quilt blocks represents a U.S. woman's death. These are 2008 deaths. Got a lot of them. The CDC says that at least half of the deaths could be prevented and it seems that we're missing a great deal of data in the United States and that we don't make a big enough effort to try to get it all. Unfortunately it's perceived as being against the interest of the hospitals, but hospitals are to serve people. And so it seems to me that we've got to be about the interest of a mother. ♪ Okay. I'll call you. Take care. Yes. Water my plants, please. Yes, Ma'am. Okay. ♪ ♪ I've got more than a hundred volunteers who've done this stitching. And I've got 17 more like this. That's how many-- And I've heard of more deaths than I've been able to get names for. So this is a big problem. It's fixable is the important thing to know. This should not scare women that-- about being pregnant, that's not our purpose here. We have to lower it to no more than three deaths per hundred thousand. When we're having eighty deaths per hundred thousand of African-American women in New York City we know something is really wrong. Where does the U.S. rank in comparison to other nations when it comes to maternal mortality? Fiftieth. Fiftieth. And that's despite the fact that we spend more per capita on the more than four million women who give birth every year. We need to change some aspects of medical education, nursing education, and we need a lot more midwives. ♪ We are one in the spirit ♪ ♪ We are one in the soul ♪ ♪ And we know that our unity ♪ ♪ Will this day unfold ♪ ♪ And we know... ♪ Amazing. Wow. This is some real historical stuff. ♪ And we know we're a family by our love ♪ Hi, my name is Etta Willis, I come from Guatemala and I work in a village, San Andrés Itzapa. I received 2,802 children in 19 years, thank you. That's Etta. And she's who I learned the Gaskin Maneuver from. I didn't invent it, I'm spreading the word. Now most babies, they can move their shoulders through there okay, but sometimes you get a baby with wider shoulders and the mother's in this compressed position. So when you turn over her pelvis tends to open a little. And if you need, even, I mean, usually what'll happen is the baby will just be born. So I was extremely lucky to learn that from that story that Etta told me. She thought it was important that I know that. And I could always tell if a midwife knew more than I did. So I would just shut up and listen to her. We were lucky to record a birth that was a shoulder dystocia. One of our midwives, Carol, fourth baby, was a shoulder dystocia. Ten and a half pound baby. It's really stretching open. It's pushing and turning around. When the contractions started and I called the midwife and she came over and checked me and said I was four centimeters. And I felt like I was much more than four centimeters. And I knew then that I was gonna have to really stretch to integrate it all. One of the things that always worked for me in labor was to make out with my husband. And he loved it, you know, he said it as the best time ever that we ever had. Push very gently, Carol. The baby's head is starting to crown. Okay. Let's take it just-- You can hold it there for now. I don't know if I can. You're doing good. That's really nice, Carol. If your belly weren't so big you could see the baby's head. Okay, here it comes. Okay, you could push a little more. Oh, hello, there. Look at that face. Push it out. Okay, push, babe. Come on, honey, come on. Okay. Put this knee over here. Way over? Yeah, like that. Okay, you wanna take a deep breath and you wanna push? Take a deep breath. Okay, let's get her on her hands and knees. I'm gonna flip you over on your hands and knees. Okay. Now take a deep breath. Okay, now push, honey. That's good. Good, good. Hello, baby. Good. All right, sweetheart. It's a girl. Carol, she is a huge baby. Hello, sweetie. Yeah. Are you gonna cry? Hello. She's startin' to cry. She's got a very strong grip. The other midwife that was there, Diane, is actually the one who said "Maybe we should flip her over". The first thought in my mind was, "Yeah, right". You know, here I am with this fat head stickin' out from between my legs I'm just gonna flip right over, you know? And that was kind of my first thought. And then the gravity of the situation really hit me and I'm like, "Yeah, you're gonna flip over. Get up off your butt, girl, and do it". She is a good baby. Oh. We're gonna give you to your mommy. It was good to flip over. Yeah, it sure did. You could really see the immediate loosening. Yeah. A lot more room. Mhmm. Luckily we did get a good video of it because I know it's really helped save some babies' lives. ♪ ♪ When you kind of signed up to come on The Farm one of the things that you were supposed to agree to besides um, being voluntary peasants was that Stephen was your spiritual teacher. I would say that evolved over time, you know, as we, or as I got older. Saw that he wasn't perfect either, you know, that he was a fallible human being. Was just really hard leaving that very austere lifestyle. When I hit my thirties I started thinking do I wanna live in a situation where I'm poor all the time? We had an open gate, we were trying to save the world and take care of everybody. You can't do it that way. The one thing I really learned is you have to start with your family and be strong there and be healthy and then you can expand and help other people. It was too many people for that amount of infrastructure. And I think also we got more well-known and more and more people were coming in to have their babies. Other people felt like, "Well, wait a minute, we're not charging a red dime, and these folks are coming in for, like six weeks before they have their baby?" We left earlier than a lot of people, we left in 1981. Then later there was really more of a, really more of an exodus. Mass exodus. Yeah. We learned our lessons that we were meant to learn together and some of us were meant to stay there and a lot of us were meant to just-- You now, it's like a dandelion. You blow on it and it just, it goes all over, and we did, we went all over the world. It was hard, I cried all the way out the gate. Took me about three hours to get it together. Even though I really wanted to go and it was time to go, it was mourning a dream. It was a wonderful experiment. And it survived. Kid Herd, the next generation. When there were a thousand of us we baby sat 'em, and we called it Kid Herd. This is beautiful, I'm so grateful. Push back and forth all the way down and see if you can feel where the back is, what the little parts are. I'll try. So you think it's breech with the back where? Here. Here, okay, let's take a look.

We're starting to train some young midwives. They've come to some births with us. They do study groups. Oh, look at your pretty belly! Oh my gosh, you've grown. I think I have, I feel. Well, you're having a little rush right now so we'll wait a second. Yeah. -Yeah. -Yeah. Stacie has turned into a Farm midwife. I delivered one of her babies and she said she wanted to help us. And so I started to take her to a few Amish birthings and she started to study. It took her, like, ten or twelve years to go through the whole certification process. Now she's a very good midwife. All right, your blood pressure's good. Anybody can learn medical skills. But I think some of the biggest things that I've learned from them is listening to yourself and the energy of birth and really being in love with the birthing process and that mom that's in labor and those kinds of things. It goes a lot deeper than just skills. So, shall we do the thing with the hips? Yes, please. So we're gonna go this way first. Yeah, push me up. Oh, thank you. Worked out kind of a routine. That's our dance routine. We still follow the same principles that we always did.

Gives you a little more, the gray hair, I've noticed, I have a little more say with the doctors. That's true. You know, I go into the hospital and I say, "this lady needs this and this". "Okay, that sounds good." I mean, you know. The doctors listen to us with gray hair. That's nice, I like that.

When I found out that I had to have forceps delivery because what an American obstetrician in 1920 called the prophylactic forceps delivery and he had been dead and in his grave for a long time, but he had way more power than I did because he wrote the text books. And he didn't really have very good faith that babies can come out of women. Except, he said savage women can do it. Savage women can do it and they will assume a squatting posture as in the act of defecation. Oh, how disgusting, we can't allow that. We can't let white women look like they're takin' a crap when they're having, when they're giving birth. It upsets us so. And here's another thing, that men think only their stuff can get way big and then get small and not be ruined. [laughter and applause] I just wanna say a word to the men here.
