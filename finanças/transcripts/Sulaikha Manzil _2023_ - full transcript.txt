There's a happy news. -I was praying-- -Are you busy? I was praying, Umma. Tell me the happy news. Haala liked the the guy in the photo you sent. Hello? Really?! Did she say that? Yeah, my son. Not just to me, she said it to Bathool as well. Alhamdulillah... Didn't I tell you that God will definitely listen to your troubles and prayers? Now, you take the discussion ahead without any delay. By the way, which photo are you talking about, Umma? What's this, Sami? What were you thinking before sending it? Umma, you know how many photos I've sent you so far, right? Kazim master’s son's photo. Ameen, isn't that the guy's name? Oh, yeah! Understood, Umma. He's our Sajeed's acquaintance. Alright. Let's fix everything soon! Okay. But... But Umma, how come she suddenly agreed to this? She's our child, after all! She knows our pain. -I'll call you back, Umma. -Okay, son. [Over phone] Kazim Master, Ameen's father has taught Haala in school. But she doesn't know Ameen. -Bathool, even I haven't seen that guy. -Really?! It's Sajeed who sent me the photo. Well, I'll meet Sajeed today or tomorrow. Will call you after that. Alright. -But.. -Huh? how come she liked him? They live in the same area. She said she could visit Umma anytime she wants. Bathool, did you ask her properly? Why don't you ask her directly? Wouldn't that be good? No. It has been four years since she even called me Ikkakka. As long as you've all spoken to her. It's enough. Sami ikka, when you meet Amir, do a video call. Everyone here wants to see him. I have known Ameen for two years. He used to live with me when he was working in Abu Dhabi. So, you know him well! Of course! I brought this proposal to you cos I'm very sure of it. Bro, can you arrange a meeting between him and me? Will you, bro? I'll set it up, bro. I've got two younger brothers as well. Adnan and Adil. Yeah, I know. Haala is our only sister. Our father passed away a long time ago, so they all consider me as their father. I also love them as my own children. The oldest brother is always like that. Sameer ikka... It has only been four months since I came back from Kerala after my holidays. Mom was pressurising me about different marriage proposals and I didn't realise how quickly my holidays got over! My plan is to take some time and prepare for the wedding. But for us expats, we can only plan things within the limited time we get. Since you both are interested in each other, we would like to quickly conduct the wedding. This is exactly what my mother says to me everyday! She barely lets me sleep in peace! That's the story of every mother, isn't it? Haala's not the type to quickly say yes to anything. It has been years since I saw my mother this happy. If you don't have any other problems, take leave and come home. After meeting, if you like each other, let's conduct the wedding at the earliest. I can get 15 days' leave only after a month now. In that case, first, I'll go and meet Kazim Master, your dad and speak to him about everything. By then, you can get try to get your leave sorted. Will that be okay for you? Alright, then. I'm someone who always follow my intuition. My mother says I got that trait from my father. Inshallah! I think we'll meet again. I also feel likewise. Inshallah! 'SULAIKHA MANZIL' Wow! It looks really good! Feels like we are in jannat! Jannat means? Heaven! Is your heaven lit up like this? Walk fast. Everyone will be awake there. Damn her joke! -Ah, Sulaithata! -Oh, you are here! Akkuappa was asking for you. -Yeah, we saw him. -Here, have tea. Here. Lakshmi chechi, take the meat when you go. Let me serve it, Umma. It's okay, dear. I'll serve it. Somehow finally made it! Bring it here. Why are you doing this, Akku? Here, stir it. This... I need to do this to prove myself! Especially to Sameer. Only then, will he have something good to say about me! Umma, note it on your calender. Whoever came for the engagement today will come for the wedding tomorrow. They'll definitely have food on both the days. And when they eat tomorrow's food, they'll definitely say, "Allah! Akku's food from yesterday was way tastier!" Umma, I swear on you! Then you'll understand the power of Akkuappa's culinary skills! Hey, hey! You don't have to tell them all this! I mean it, Akkuappa. You just don't know! But you are deserving. -Here, have tea. -Thank you. You really think so?! Oh, well! What's the name of the guy coming tomorrow? The one Sami said? The cook? from Dubai? Ambayath Subramanian! [Laughs] Ambayath Subramanian! This Ambayath has no clue, who he is locking horns with! Allah! Poor thing! He's going to be embarrassed! Poor thing, huh?! Who's your uncle? Him or me?! -You, of course! -Are you sure?! Listen... Eh?! What's the matter with you?! How do I chop the meat? Shred it with your tooth! Dear woman, just chop it with a knife! -Oh! -Now you know! What were you saying? Good that the competition is to make things tastier. And once people taste this deliciousness, there's gonna be a smile on their faces! After that, I'll have a talk with Sameer! You wait and watch! Bathool... Tell your husband to brace himself for an El Clasico! Go do your wudu (purification ritual) and pray. It's almost dawn. Call Adil as well. He must be sleeping like a baby! Go in. I'll handle it. Let me finish this last one and go. Jameela, are you up? -Yeah, aunt. -Here, have your tea. Keep it there. Where's she? Where's the bride, Sulu? I'll go get her. -Bring her quickly. -Sulaikha... You change quickly. -Go soon. -I'll be back. Itha, which direction is the Qiblah, the Kaaba at Mecca? Sami, is that you? Yes, Mom. Why did you sleep here, son? You could have slept properly on the bed. It has been a week since you got some sleep, son. I did sleep, Mom. After tomorrow I can peacefully sleep, right? Shall I get you a black tea? No need. I'll make the tea. Akku has already started his stunts in the morning. Oh, yeah! The groom's family will be here for the engagement by 11 o'clock. By the way, why did you climb all those stairs? Let me go and wake that girl up. If you're going to the mosque, visit your father’s tomb. Take your brothers along too. Haala... Dear... Haala... What's it, Mom? All this was wide open! Did all of you all sleep on this bed? No, Umma. I slept on the floor. You should've come to my room, my child. Come downstairs. Let's do the prayer together. I'll just come. Moothumma and Ammayi, your aunts are waiting for you downstairs. I'll come, Umma. Hello. O Dear God! I felt like calling you... the moment I woke up. It has been a few days... and I have no idea if I'm asleep or in a trance. But... it feels good. It's our wedding tomorrow. Nobody would believe it, if we tell them we haven't even had a proper conversation. -Right? -Yeah. You still are not talking to me. Isn't it good to talk to each other before the marriage? -Don’t you think so? -Y... yeah. Are you busy now, Haala? Mom... had called me for prayer. Can I call back later? You told me the same thing when I called last night. Oh, that… I fell asleep… -Will you call me back when you're free? -Yeah. Okay. My aunties are waiting for me downstairs. Salaam. Salaam. Okay. Where are you off to? To buy jasmine flowers for Liya. -At this odd time? -Yeah. Let me see if Ameen is up. Let him sleep. What is the problem if I go? The streets are full of stray dogs. You just wait. -I don't want! -Why? Fine, drink this milk. -I don't want! -Then?! What does my darling niece want? -I need jasmine flowers. -Jasmine?! -Then, give me a kiss. -No! -Give him a peck. -Then, no flowers! -C'mon, give. -Mwah! Ameen, open it and have a look. It's a gift from your brother-in-law. Aha! O dear bro-in-law! Superb colour, right? Really cool! The wedding suit looks really nice, right? -Is this my wedding suit?! -Yeah. Come on, try it. What? Now?! Let me go and get the flowers first. Get me the key, Mom. Ameer's friend took it yesterday. You take Kuttan's father's bike for now. Kuttan must be up now. Go! Why do you have to keep this inside your house?! If we keep it outside, the dog will pee on it. Yeah! As if your bike is the dog's personal urinal! Where are you off to early morning wearing those green shoes? What do you mean where! It's your wedding, man! But it's tomorrow, not today! Tomorrow, I'll be on another look. And who are you dressing up for?! Ami... Shall I get you a tea? No, chechi, I just had my tea. Kuttan will be come for the engagement. His father called me yesterday. He said he won't be able to make it. -Yeah, he told me too. -Oh, did he?! It's okay! We've got Kuttan, right! I can't come. I've got to work on the pavilion. -What work! -You better go! By the way, when will your aunt, Akkarthammayi reach, ? I've given you a ton of work to do over there. If you waste time checking out that girl instead of completing it! Kuttan, you'll get from me! What! Even after going abroad, you're not at all progressive! Ami bro, shall I give you an advice? Will I be able to handle it? You need to be a bit more romantic. Have you ever seen my romance, kiddo? Watch out! Watch out! I'll catch! -I will! I will! -Kabbadi! Kabbadi! -Hold tight! -Don't leave! Yay! Flip him over, man! Ameen! Welcome, my dear! Look, who's here! Our groom-to-be! Hello, mister groom! -Ami, Is the porotta stove hot yet? -Where's Naim? When I left the porotta stove was lying out in the cold! O God! Bapputti didn't reach? Baputti, my foot! Quick, go and start making porottas! Otherwise we'll cook you on that stove! Bugger off, man! I've been starving myself for two days so that I can feast at your wedding! If I don't get anything to eat, you'll be done for! There will be enough food for you there, habibi! -It's all set! -Then I'm cool. Hey, Anwar. Come. Come here, man. Look at you big shot from Dubai! Kulsu... Hey, Kulsu... Do you want shades? You wanna put them on? Don't want? Okay! I'll put it. What's up with your face? Eh?! I mean, looks like you're sleep deprived. What?! What what? Been there, done that! I know how it is! Those sleepless moonlit nights! While enjoying the little pleasures of courtship! Well I don't have those little pleasures. Eh?! Left, left. Look at this. I don't even have a good photo of hers. What are these then? Videos?! These are cropped screenshots that I took from her Instagram. If someone asks, I at least need a photo to show! Oh! That's it! You did a bad job of cropping! Look at the clumsy edges! Aha! Is that what you understood from everything I just said? Not like that, bro. Do you know something? Every morning I sent her a 'good morning'. If I am lucky, I might get a smiley for reply by night. She hangs up saying she'll call me back right away. And no clue, when that will happen! And then I shamelessly call her again. This has become a routine. It is normal, man. Just think, It has only been what, 10 or 13 days since she came to know of your existence in this world! And it is the same for you as well. How can one send casual messages based on such a small association? Give her some time to get comfortable. I'm not someone who hasn’t seen women or texted them. It will be confusing. That's the process! By tomorrow morning, your confusions will be cleared! Everything is okay, man. Chill, man! I need to chill... -Kulsu... -What's your opinion?

Thoiba or Sara? -Thoiba! -Then Thoiba it is! Everyone is happy. All the aunties are on cloud nine because of the wedding. Well, it has been a long time since everyone got together like this. You can see that happiness on their faces. Here. As the wedding was fixed in less than two weeks, I didn't think we would finish inviting everyone. But I think everyone will come. Why count only the weeks? It has been 4-5 years since I've been searching for a groom for her. There's no point in counting weeks or months, Bathool. Hey, Adu... Tell me, Sameer ikka. -What is this? -What?! Eh? I... I was asking the same thing! What a mess! That event manager gave it. And who chose the event management? Tha... that would be me. Didn’t I tell you that there should be no plastic bottles here. Yes. You idiot! Do you even hear what I say?! No, ikka. I am returning it... It has been returned! Use your brains when you're told to do something! Yes, ikka! What am I saying?! And what is he hearing?! Daddy... Gosh! Did Haala’s friends eat? Yeah, they did. They had their food. What about you? 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! -It's your turn! Others go and hide! -Me?! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Do you want cumin water, dear? I'm good, Auntie. Hey, loser, I saw you! You may come back! Aren't you hiding behind Hasaal? -Haala... -Yeah? Are you happy? You think I am not? Kind of. My expressions are not good enough, no? Exactly! It's not coming from within you! Get lost! You know... That excitement one should feel during their wedding? I don’t feel it! Nothing else, no problems at all! Otherwise, I'm chill! You're not hiding anything, right? No, nothing else! That excitement I mentioned earlier, that's my villain! It will get better, right? Of course, it'll be fine! -You are happy, right? -Mm-hmm! Nothing else matters! Everything will fall in place! Mwah! Oh, God! My child! I'll be right back, okay! Go and serve this. Come on, Mom! My clothes will get dirty! Who are you dressed up for?! Hold this! -Then what about this? -I'll give it to him. Here. Ami... Tell me, Umma. -Who's it? -Here. Answer. No, I'll call back later. Ami... Will you try on the dress your brother-in-law bought for you? Are you crazy, Umma? I don't wanna dress up like a king! It is a wedding suit! Wedding suit, my foot! -Just wear it once and... -And?! video call your brother-in-law. It will make him happy. Aren't you my sweet boy?! If people see me wearing that dress, I'll be the laughing stock of this town! Why can't you understand? Apparently, Moothappa, your uncle, isn't coming to the wedding. He's saying he was not invited to the engagement. Who?! Our Moothappa? But wasn't he the one who fixed the engagement and wedding?! So what? After all, he's your dad’s elder brother! Just invite him once again! Big deal! Go now! Stop wasting time and go! Is there anyone else you forgot to invite?! Where you going? I'll drop you. No, I'm good. Going to Moothappa's house. -Take the bike. -It's ok, I'll walk. Sara... -Give this phone to Haala aunty. -Okay. Move! Move! It'll get cut now. Hello? Hello! Who's this? Is Haala there? Phone call for Haala Aunty! Who's it? -Take that phone from her or she'll fall. -I won't fall! I'll go keep the dress. Give the phone to Haala. Lemme give it to her. Hello? Who's this? Energy... YAY! Okay! Once more. -Call for Haala Aunty! -We're clicking photos, dear! Who's calling? No name, only number... Unknown number, just ignore it. Will call back. -Ruined the flow! -Hello? Hello? Where are you off to? Where else? To the wedding house! You don't need to go there now. Why is that? Don't go to a wedding where I'm not invited! You don't come. I am going. You sit here being all stubborn like a child! My dignity is more important for me. Dignity?! -Moothumma! -Hey Ami! Moothappa... Moothappa... Why is the groom here? Don't you've things to do? I came to invite you for the engagement. Eh? I arranged this wedding! Why do you need to invite me?! We were about to leave. See, she's ready too. I just have to wear a shirt. You wait. Let me get you some fresh goat milk. Moothumma, I don't want anything. -There's a lot to do at home. -Wait! It's not really goat milk. Still, you drink and go. In the meantime, I can change as well. Come in. Watch your head when you get out. Ami, this is what you'll be wearing! Your suit for this evening. How's it? What the hell is this?! A python's skin?! I won't wear it, man! Whatever skin it maybe you'll have to wear it! Arun, why are you so adamant to torture your friend on his wedding day?! We're adamant when it comes to you! These two days, we say and you obey! Stop being a spoilsport! The dress my brother-in-law sent was better than this! -I won't wear either! -We'll see! -Prasad... -Yeah. Rahman ikka... Oh! Rahman ikka is on fire! -Go fast. -Ta-ta! Naheem, where's Ameer? He has gone to arrange a car for the wedding. Car?! Why are you giggling, you losers?! Man, this rocks! A real privilege to even travel in it! It rocks only for you! I'm the one who's driving it! If this is how things are, best not to get married only! What do you even know about cars, Ameer?! It's vintage, man! Looks like it has been bandaged! Crap! Isn't that Akkarthammayi, your aunt?! Stop ogling, Reyan, Aunty will understand! Allah, forgive me! As-salamu alaykum. Wa ʿalaykumu s-salam. What is this?! A circus car? This is Ameen's bridal car! Did Moothappa see it? He will... when we reach! -Get in. -Good luck then! Watch your step. It's rusty, you might get septic! Get in, dear. Allah! Shall we go, dear? Let's go! Amazing! -Who's going in this car?! -The groom! The groom is going in this car! Not the groom... but the groom's friends will! We'll see! We'll decide who will! Ami... It will be a disgrace if you go to the bride's house in this car! No doubt! -Prasad etta! -Come on, man! -I'll say! -What will you say?! -I'll say it as it is! -Any other option? -No option! -Nothing! Just shut up. My Moothappa will handle the rest! -Out of this world! -Moothappa! -Where'd you get it from? -That's it, Ami! -Eh?! -What happened? Didn't you like it? You won't! Only a true artist can understand its value. You need to have some artistic sense. Exactly! Artistic sense! Are you not going? Let him come! Then why were you rushing?! One should have the common sense to be on time during such occasions! When I called him they were like they've sent him! Ah, here he comes! They only sent his head or what?! As-salamu alaykum! No, there's a body as well! -Hi! -Shall we go then? -Start the car. -How come you are late? I have to dress up and look good, no! That takes time! Listen, Kasim, come here. We'll fix the wedding and be back. You handle everything here. -As-salamu alaykum. -Wa ʿalaykumu s-salam. Ami, do you wanna go too? I'll go if you guys allow me! I've been thinking the same for the past few days. Sameer, join us. Okay, so let's begin what we are here for. So, the reason we have gathered here is... fix the Nikah of Ameen Kasim, the eldest son of Edakkedathu Kasim and Tekkevalappu... Sulaikha-- -Not Sulaikha, Haleema! -Yes, Haleema. -Haleema, Haleema! -Slip up! I mean son of Haleema and... Haala Parveen, the youngest daughter of Aarakathu Bava... -Am I right so far? -Correct! Correct! Daughter of Aarakathu Bava and Musliyaalakathu Sulaikha. And we are here to fix the date of their wedding. So isn't the wedding tomorrow?! -Yes! -What! It shouldn't be just any day. -We need an auspicious date. -That's right! Then, 14th of next month will be good. Which means we also get two holidays with it. So the wedding is postponed?! How about Onam then? You'll get 10 days holiday! We're talking about a wedding, not Onam flower carpet contest! How about Sunday, 15th of this month? What do you all think? That will be 14 Shawwal 1443 according to the Islamic, Hijri calendar. What do you all think? Is it an auspicious day, Musliyar? Everyday is an auspicious day! Isn't it? So everyone's happy, right? Then let’s fix it? Now let's focus on our tummy! Then, shall we eat, Musliyar? Al-Fatiha! (Prayer recitation) [Chanting prayers] Give me your phone number. I'll let you know if there are any catering needs in our area. Thank you so much. He thinks I'm a cook or what?! He was only saying the food is great! Leave it! Really good! -He thought I'm a professional cook! -Subru etta... When did you reach? You said you'll call before you start? Is it necessary to call if you will reach on time? Hm? Where is Sameer sir? Sameer ikka is inside. There are some guests. Shall we go inside? -This is our... -Sure, but what's happening here? You're Ambayath Subru, right? I've heard a lot about you. Aren't you? Are you the cook? -No... -I'm not a cook... I just... If the food you prepared is bad, it reflects badly on my company, no? -But the food wasn't bad! Great reviews! -Yeah, everyone liked it. From toddlers to top seniors, the food worked for all of them! Just a stroke of God's luck! What do you know about Ambayath catering? -Hey! -Why is it bad?! If we're in charge of catering an event, we decide who should eat what! He's throwing too much attitude! Don't say anything. Nobody reported to the company about such an event happening and that the cook was an outsider. But Chef, he isn't an outsider! He's our uncle. Yes, our own uncle! That's not my issue. I'm here because Sameer sir called me. And for the time being, I'll let this go! That's enough! -Not coming? -Yes, sir. -Then come. -Let me deal this. What happened, Uncle? Tell me! I don't think we can do our dish! His mood and attitude is just off! Don't be negative. If we go and talk it will work out. -You just come with me. -No need. -Come, Uncle. -I don't wanna talk to him! Um... hello. Did the engagement party leave? Yes, they left 20 minutes back. -Is it?! -Ya. Oh, really... They just reached! -Oh, okay. -Yeah, just now. Are you free now? I'm free. Over here everyone is busy, except me. I wanted to speak to you about a few things. Tell me. Not like this. I mean I wanted to speak to you in person. We'll be seeing each other tomorrow, no? Yeah, that's right. But that will be a formal meeting, like strangers, no? That is fun, right? It is indeed fun. But because the wedding was fixed in a hurry, I don't even know if you really like me. For real! If we could just talk about all this openly, I'd feel at peace. That's why... Tomorrow is our marriage. That's the highlight! Yes... it is... But still... Honestly, what’s there to talk about now? Allah! If you ask this question after our wedding, that's it! Let's start by saying something. Okay? Alright, I'll compromise. Oh, good! Today I'm going to Natures beauty parlour. -Natures? The one in Pathodi? -Yeah. I know that place. Come there. Shall I leave now? Hey, not now! I'll call you once I start from here. When... you... call... leave... No need. I'll tell you once I start from here. No need, eh? Okay, okay! Alright. He's only a small kid. Don't hit him, sister. That's how kids are! When did you all grow up?! Don't hit him. Poor child! Why were you playing with the bathroom pipe?! Aami... She was calling me. The pipe has burst, Aunty! Haala, do you remember Jawahar, your classmate from MES college? -Jawahar, the singer, right? -Yeah, the same. He conveyed his wishes to you. Oh? -He's back home now? -Yeah, he's here. Didn't you invite him to the wedding? I've told him to come. Ameen says he wants to meet me. Really? Where? On our way to the beauty parlour. Yeah, meet him. -Are you not coming? -Of course, I will. Should we tell Bathool bhabhi? Nah. No need, no? You were widely appreciated here! He can't ignore you. Just ask. You want me to bow down to him?! Let’s ask Sami. Who? Sameer ikka?! Allah! He's only your big brother, not mine! Come! Akkauppa! The consequences will be huge! Sami... You have to be here tomorrow! -Sami? -Huh? Okay, I'll call you back. -Yes, Uncle. -Did you eat the ghee rice? Everybody liked it. It was delicious, Uncle. Congrats! Thank you! Sami ikka, what about tomorrow? What about tomorrow?! There's a widespread opinion that I should cook one dish for the feast. Can you speak to Ambayath? Uncle... Subru is very egoistic. You know, a perfectionist?! He will be furious if we go and tell him about a new dish the day before! That won't happen, Uncle. Oh! Yes, yes! Subru is an egoistic man, Akkuappa! Didn't I tell you? When did you tell me?! I had told you. It's alright. Why didn't you tell me about the pain? No, it only just started. Lift your leg. If you go to the graveyard without shoes, you won't get pricked by thorns, you'll get bitten by snakes! You and your sentiments! -Is it hurting? -Ouch! And you can't take painkillers either! No, no need of all that! This pain feels good. Hm, really? The pain feels good? Back in the days when I used to play football, I'd have 4-5 thorns on my feet, everyday! Isn't Ambayath Subru an acquaintance of yours? Yeah, why? He's bragging non-stop over there. Bring me that jewellery box. Aha! This is really nice. You could have bought two. My darling Bathool... Didn't you forget the watch you bought for me in Dubai? It's in our flat! I swear on Mamburam Thangal! It's in Dubai. I believe you. You go and give this to Haala, please. Isn't she your sister?! Why can't you give it to her? I don't think I can do it. I gave it a lot of thought. After all, I'm her big brother. I may have made mistakes while trying to do things for her good. And trying to mending them too. For now, you please go and give it to her. Khadeeja itha, who are you playing with right now? Be quiet, Sulaikha! I lost two twice cos you distracted me. Umma... Are you busy? Khadeeja itha is very busy! Sulu, I warned you! Sami ikka bought this for Haala. Please give this to her. Why can't he give it to her? I told him. He said Mom will give it. You go and give it to her, dear. It'll be the same if either of you give it to her. That's enough. Go and give it. Don't come in! It's a wagon tragedy! Not wagon tragedy! Mass killing! Be careful, kids! The kids have made a mess, no! That's okay! Come, sit. They've already started building the bridal chamber? Aha! This is awesome! Thank you! It wasn't from me! It's from Sami ikkakka. Go and give that kiss to him instead. It's just a kiss. You only give it. He'd like it better if you give him. Just go talk to him, no? I am talking. An elder brother holds a complicated position, isn't it? He needs to be a role model for everyone. He needs to scold and control everyone. Whether he likes it or not, he needs to do it! Even if a brother tries to abandon his responsibilities responsibilities won't leave them alone! If you and I won't understand Sami ikkakka, then who will? Even before I wish for it, Sami ikka always gets me whatever I like or want. What more can I say? Hello guys! What's up? -Did you eat anything? -Come sit. -Where's the baby girl? -Uff! I just put her to sleep. Bhabhi... sister-in-law? We're thinking of going to the beauty parlour. I'll tell Adil to take you guys. -Why don't I just drive? -That's fine. -Then go and come back before lunch. -Okay. I thought you told your bhabhi. I should've told, no? Did you call Ameen? No, I'll text him. She hasn't called me yet. Anyway, it's past 12. I'm feeling really stressed, man. Also, do you think I look better in a shirt or t-shirt? Just wear whatever you want my dear Ameen! But this evening, there'll be a golden dress for you! -You'll have to wear it! -Moothappa can wear it! But you're the crazy guy who's on his way now, to flirt with the woman you're going to marry tomorrow! All the best! ♪ This heart is crazy, this heart is passionate ♪ ♪ This heart is crazy, this heart is passionate ♪ That's how you sing it Hey, I'll be a bit late, okay? Hey, I'll be a bit late, okay? Hey, I'll be a bit late, okay? -What's up? -Hello. Where are you Ameen ikka? I... I came to the bank. What happened? To... to the bank? Isn't it second Saturday today? Ah, yes, it's second Saturday. I realised it only after coming here. I'll go to the ATM and come, okay? -Hang up now. Bye. -Okay. Hey, I'll be a bit late, okay? Should we call Ameen? -We'll tell him after we leave. -Here comes our bride! Haala Parveen! -Oh-no! -And our cousin, Dr. Amina Hussain! Allah! It's Tommy Shelby! And guys, this is our Adi ikkakka. He's the younger brother of Haala. That's enough, dear. You can leave now. What's it? Tell me the truth! Where are you both off to? To the beauty parlour. To the parlour?! You already look like you're coming back from a parlour! Why go again? Can't you just mind your own business? -Sure, if that's how it is! -Yeah! Alright then! Come fast! We also want to go the parlour! -We're screwed! -I'll book for you. No need! Just give us the money, we can go. Aha! What's this?! Looting in broad daylight?! -Not gonna happen! -Fine, we'll also come then. -Right, girls? -Uff! Here's the money! Do whatever you want! If the booking gets cancelled, we won't get another slot. This won't be enough. There are so many of us! Just give them, Ami! -Where were you? Come here. -Coming. Why are you standing there? Come for photos. Mirza's mom and aunty are here. Hey, where's the bride off to? Sit here. Haala, let's take a picture together. -Where are you going? -Why now? -Beauty parlour. -She's not dressed up! -People are here. Go after sometime. -Photographer is eating. He'll come now. We can all click a picture. Sure! -Umma, don't you know her? -No... Dr Amina, Hussain uncle's eldest daughter. She's Haala's best friend. Sorry, I didn't know. -You've have a daughter, no? -Yes, Kenza, she's one. Hey, Mirza! What happened? Why did you bent now? To take this... I'll take it and give, no? Give me that key. -First one? -Yes, our first baby. Stop playing. We need to go. You go after half an hour. We need to go somewhere. If we miss the slot, we can't go again. -Listen... -What, Amina? You can go in a bit! It's okay. You can take an appointment for 5 to 6. Now you go upstairs with them. Exactly! Umma, let's go sit upstairs. Come. -Come, Mirza, -You wanted to go, no? Get lost! -We'll go! -You can go to the parlour any time. -Should I tell Ameen that we'll be late? -First let's get out of here. Why are you always snacking, Mirza? You'll get gastric! Do you wanna eat or drink? To drink. Make sure it has a lot of water. -Eh? -Get one with a lot of water. Aren't you Kasim master's son? Yes. Isn't it your elder brother's wedding tomorrow? -Yeah. -Then why are you loitering around here? Two of my friends are coming here. Came to pick them up. Aha! Here, drink it. Do you've Google Pay? Of course! -Umma? -You devil! Where the hell are you? I'm at Pathodi. What are you doing there? Didn't I tell you that my friends are coming? Then bring them here. People are asking for you over here. What do I tell them?! C'mon, Umma. Everyone's there, right. Ameer and the guys. Enough with your antics. Just come home fast. I'll come, Umma. Well, darling, Is this what you do 24x7? Ironing! -Where are you going? -To my friend's flat. Don't you have duty today? It's my day off. What happened? Tell the truth, where are you off to? I'm going for a wedding. Will they serve biriyani? Of course! Not just biriyani, lot of Egyptian and Lebanese girls too! They even have a pavilion like in Kerala! Yeah, see. See... see... Allah! Uppa! Not Allah's Uppa, but your Uppa! -As-salamu alaykum. -Wa ʿalaykumu s-salam. That's Ameen's brother-in-law! Wow, you came! Will I miss my bro-in-law's wedding? What are you even saying? Haleema, Liya baby, come quick! -Bro-in-law! -Hey! My younger bro-in-law! -As-salamu alaykum. -Wa ʿalaykumu s-salam. What happened to your leg? When I went to play... Those are his hard earned trophies from the football matches! -Coming straight from the airport? -Yes, straight to here. -I've bought something. -Awesome! -What's it? -Try it on. Allah! Thank you! Open it Ameer. -Dude... -Tell me, dude! How did it go? Not yet come! You're stuck there, aren’t you? -All the very best! -Thank you! By the way... I'm getting calls from home asking for you. I guess they got fed up calling me. Are you gonna keep waiting or? Anyway, I waited for so long. I'll wait for some more time. Maybe they're busy with things. Well, don't lose hope. Good luck. Allah! Umma's calling again! I'll call you back later. Alright, alright! -See you there. -Okay. Just tell him that you can't come. You can see him everyday after your marriage. Do you want to go to the parlour? -Yeah! -Yeah! Adil has come. Quick, go! Let's go? Come. -I'll take care of your baby. -Thank you. Come soon! Look who's coming! I didn't think we could-- Surprise! Our princess! The sunshine of our Sulaikha Manzil! Haala, Amina... See, I've brought the beauty parlour home. Now you don't need to go anywhere. Do whatever you want. -Aren't you both happy? -Of course! Yeah! Double happy! -Happy, right? -Of course! What are you waiting for? Come in. That gold facial you mentioned, I need one, ok! Come Amina, let's paint your face! I'll call and tell Ameen that I can't come. Haala, come, dear. I thought the stain wouldn't go away. -Only the coconut fibre leaves stains. -Oh, that's what, eh! Coconut water will never leave stains. People generally have that misunderstanding. But that's not true. It's the fibre that stains. Really? Leaving? -Hey... I don't think I can come today. We were gonna leave-- Aami... -Hello. -Hello. Hello. I'm Amina. Give the phone to Haala. Haala is a bit busy now. I said give the phone to Haala! -Hello… -Hello. Only your time is valuable or what? Don't you know how to respect other people's time and feelings? Then what worth do you have? I've been trying to talk to you for the past two weeks or so! I just wanted to talk! I'm sick of begging like this. I feel disgusted with myself. How do I live with someone like this? Don't you know how to respect others? HELLO?! HELLO! Damn! What did you do yesterday! What? You should've just passed the ball. I was assisting, no! -That's how you assist? -You think he's Superman? To fly and catch the ball! He is Superman! It's just that right now, he's out of form. That's cos of his age The groom is on full charge! Where were you, man? You've a surprise guest! I think if you're after Hajj, come see Dubai Festival too! You've to see it! Brother-in-law! My dearest brother-in-law! Are you shocked?! He's shocked! Look at him! How shocked he is! Did you think I would miss your wedding and stay back in Dubai?! He didn't even tell me and came via video call! I thought he was in Dubai when I was speaking to him! She saw the pavilion outside and is asking me if it's Dubai! So let's eat? ♪ Yo bro-in-law, my dearest bro-in-law! Let's eat! Let's eat biriyani! ♪ You sit and eat. I'll change and come. -I'm eating. -Where did you go during lunch hour?! Look how tanned and dried the groom's face has become! Sit here and eat. -I'll eat. -Before that, just wear this and show. He has asked some 100 times if you liked it! How can I eat if I wear this?! -I'll try it later-- -First you wear this! -That's fine. -Change into this! You've been saying this since morning! He bought it with so much love! Why can't you wear and show?! -Why can't you understand, huh?! -Why won't you wear, huh?! You and your stupid costume! Move! Son... Are you happy now? Feeding and caring?! Had enough, no! You come with me! What are you doing, Hawa?! Why's he behaving like this on a good day! Anwar. Now I'm really confused, bhabhi. It's quite clear to me! How will you adjust all your life with someone who behaves like this? You know, if this had happened one week back! Hmph! You don't have to adjust thinking it's too late now! We won't force you to do something you don't like! Exactly! Just cos he had to wait for a bit... he'll say whatever the hell he wants?! Sami ikka's theory is that when an alliance comes from a new family, we should first imagine how they'd react when a confrontation arises. So? I think Ameen's gonna call again. And if he's calling to say sorry, just hear him out. What if he has something to say? And if he doesn't, don't tolerate it anymore, dear. We'll see to the rest. Darn! You got angry at that girl too?! Your performance during the last two issues has been weak! Not weak! Terrible, just terrible! Pass me a cigarette. Your bloody cigarette! In those two hours you were away from your house, how many calls did you get? You got at least 13 calls, right?! So imagine her situation? You're thinking about it, now?! No, man, that's not it... She only said she'll come, right. It's a wedding house, man! Not mention the thousand functions they have at the bride's house! Yellow themed, pink themed and whatnot! Imagine how hard it must be to get out! Just think, man! Sigh... Is it KSEB office? -That was awful of me, no? -Awful! Awful, it seems! I don't know the consumer number. We don't have electricity. Yes, a branch fell. The road next to the school. On that road, you can see a wedding house. You think saying sorry is enough? Huh? Fine, call. Take your phone. Oh dear God! Fine, I'll call. What? Call! Yeah, let me call? Oh, okay! Carry on! [Phone rings] [Phone rings] Hello? S... sorry! Sorry, Haala. The way I spoke to you... was really bad. It's cos I was waiting there for a while... I lost it... Once again, I'm sorry. Oh, but where were you? I left home early. Allah! I was waiting near the parlour... I had told you to leave only after I call, no? You did tell... Due to my overeagerness... I left immediately. -Oh, I didn't know about that, okay? -I understood. But really... is it so important that we meet? I mean, isn't the wedding tomorrow? Even if we don't meet each other now, the wedding will happen just fine. But if we do meet, tomorrow... we'll be even more excited to meet tomorrow, right? That's right... but... what are we going to talk about in this short time? I don't even know if you like sulaimani tea or black coffee when you wake up in the morning. We're going to be spending the rest of our lives together. Doesn't matter how little time we get, at least we'll have some understanding of each other, when we meet in person, no? And what if we don't think it's okay? If we feel it's not okay... this wedding shouldn't happen. That's how it should be... Isn't it?! So, you really want to meet is it? Shouldn't we? But you'll need to come here. I don't see any other way. To your house?! -But... I... -I think around 7 or 8 o'clock... everyone will go to the pavilion to eat. So Ameen, any time after 7:30 is fine. Will that be a problem for you? No problem for me! I can take that risk. But will you be able to come? Yeah. I can come till the end of the property. Alright, then. -I'll come. -Okay. So the countdown begins at 7:30. Getting out from here is going to be a circus! But still I'll come! Maslamah, be safe. Prasad etta, it is back! Etta boy! The electricity is back! Is it? Okay! -Prasad etta... -Yea? It's time to change this. That one? I feel it will run for another 7 years or so! This one! -Prasad! We're leaving. -Come, come! No, no! Come here! Eat and then go! No, there are a few broken lines over there. -You cannot leave without having food. -Hey Ameen, how's it going? -Do come in the evening, okay? -Of course. Let me serve them food. -Brother-in-law... -Where were you? -I looked all over the house for you. -I was on the terrace. -What happened? -There's something. Tell me. Brother-in-law... Don't take it to heart... Earlier, I was stressed and in a bad mood... Let it go, man! You should be happy now! Be happy and enjoy! You know, I've five sisters. Which means, five brother-in-laws and five wedding suits. And if I could deal with that easily! If you have any issue you only got one brother-in-law to deal with! There's no problem. I'll wear it. I actually liked it! Seriously! You don't have to force yourself to wear it! Not at all! But just tell her you'll wear it, that's all! She means well, poor thing. Go on. Phew! Now I feel better! Hey lil bro-in-law! -Umma! -What! Hey Umma! -Stop it... -Look over there. That's what I was saying, right! And now she's laughing! I know it isn't that great... You don't have to wear this. But just tell him you'll wear it, that's all! I'll take care of the rest.

Hey! Get the car! Amina... It's going to be fine, no? Stop worrying. We're going to the hospital, no? I'm fine, Ikkakka. I just slipped. -You shouldn't have come, Ikkakka! -Of course, Ikkakka will come! Ikkakka will come! Go fast, Ikka. Anyway, a check up will be good. I've been waiting for a long time. Please! You can say it openly, Fida. I want a reply regardless of what the answer maybe. Fida... You're not in some other relationship, are you? No, I'm not. But I like someone. Are you sad? It's okay... After all... you can't buy love. It's fine. Oh, you scared me! What's it? Is it true? Whatever you told Reyan. What? That you like someone. Yea... But don't tell anyone, okay? Who's it? You're going to join Science group, no? Mm... Which school? AVI School. I'm in Thrikaav School. You come and join my school, ok? What? Want something? Go change your dress. I'm going to change. -Go on, go on! -Why are you badgering me? Huh? Why don't you wear a yellow hat as well? Stop with your stupid jokes! Go stand at the entrance! Allah! The python dress! It's okay if the python swallows us, eh! -Open! Open! Open! -No! No! No! -Stop playing around! -Ameen! You will pay for it! -Stop playing around! I won't open! -You keep quiet and just open the door! Okay, smile! Master, please come. Hello, this is the oldest son, Ameen and the second son, Ameer. Here. Which one is this? -What's this? Only fruits?! -He only eats fruits. Really? Why so? -Who knows! -By the way... -I got a call from the hospital. -And? Everything is fine. So Sameer ikka will be back any moment! -Allah! Who's this? -I think it's Sameer ikka. Hold on! -Screwed... -It's us! Why do you need so much light?! Switch off that torch before someone sees. -I almost died! -Bro, it's just a little light. Why don't you start a bonfire! This is nice! Listen, Subru etta, first of all, everything has been set up here. Now don't go there for anything! You know what'll happen if Sameer ikka finds out! -You'll get a good beating! -And I'll need to skip town! You guys don't worry. We're old friends. -Are you sure? -Of course! -You won't go overboard, no? -Of course, not! -Then come. -You want one? Best, what did I just tell you? -It's fine, carry on. -Oh, good God! Aha! Look at you! You've swallowed the python and smoking alone, huh?! This is new! -What happened? -Dude! We need to go! It's 7:30! Were you being serious? Dude, there's a whole mob downstairs! It's just a matter of 7-8 hours! You can see her tomorrow. Did you really think I was joking? No, dude! But how do we get out from here?! Exactly, how?! That's what I'm also asking you! If there's no other way, I'll jump over this wall! I'm serious! Listen... So you really want to go? Right? Right? Anwar! You're going to get it from me! I'm warning you! Did you just nudge me? Listen... I've another idea. He can easily make it happen! -Who? -It'll happen! That means, you'll jump over the wall. Haala will come and you guys will meet. Before the wedding, a rendezvous under the moonlight! A night before your first night. This should happen! This should happen tonight! If this doesn't happen tonight, then it can happen only for his next marriage! But... Ah! I've got an idea! It's quite clichéd but perfect for this situation! That's fine! How... how clichéd is it?! Okay! So ready one... -Two... -Hey! -What's happening? -Allah! Are removing the electric fuse? I told you it's clichéd, right! Go on and say three, bro! Three! -Ami! -Power's gone! Run! Take him too! If someone sees us, it'll be such a huge embarrassment! Why! A groom jumping over the fence to see his bride on the night before the wedding! Isn't that a sure shot sign of a romantic guy?! Ah! Romantic! But this isn't just romance! It's anxiety! Pure anxiety! Haala didi, the food was too good! Just fantastic! Aha! You're putting on mehendi! -Food is ready! -Hey the mehendi will rub off! I'll come, I'll come! -It's over. You can put it down, Haala. -Come didi, let us eat! I'll come later. Let me go to the washroom and freshen up. Okay? But you can't be late! The bride shouldn't be on an empty stomach! -Come! -Not right now. -You carry on buddies, please! -Come on, everyone! -Go on, I'll come. -Now after food! Come Sara, let's go! Come, come! Come on, come on! Come here, you! Allah! We've reached her house! -Don't look that side. Don't look! -Look where?! Towards her house! We saw them just this morning! As it is, this costume invites attention! What about mine then? Your shirt is so much better! Arun, stop joking. We shouldn't be laughing. Be serious. They've lit up the whole property! Completely lit up! -Yeah, man! -Just park somewhere on the side. Let me try calling. Park here, on the side. -Hello? -Hello. Haala, I'm here. Oh, where have you reached? I'm almost behind the house. There's a wall adjacent to the road. Okay, get down there. -Shall I get out here? -Yes, I'll be there soon. Okay, I'm getting out. Alright. -Okay! So I'll go and come back! -Go on. Hang on, one minute! Let that car pass or it's embarrassing! How's it embarrassing?! This is fun, man! -Arun, you're going to get it from me! -Just keep quiet, Arun! Keep your mouth shut! -Call me if anything. -No problem, man! Be fearless and go! Dude, be careful, okay! -That's true. -You got something to smoke? -I've got Kings. -Okay, let's go out. What was that guy's name? -Sulaikha's... -"Not Sulaikha, Haleema!" That was so funny! This... it wasn't me... My friends forced me to... It's not a reflection of my dressing sense. No, it looks good. Really? It looks good? Did you go through a lot of trouble to get here? Hey, no! What about you, Haala? The ones who went to the hospital aren't back yet. So I could get out with much risk. Oh, yeah! What happened to that? Your sister-in-law, no? -What happened? -No problem. Adnan ikka gets stressed out easily. Oh, is it... We don't have much time, okay? Quick, what did you wanna ask? Allah! It's not like I've questions to ask. We've not had that many conversations, no? But... we've got so many days ahead of us. That's right. But... I wanted to break the formality between us. Which is why I kept calling you. Your reaction... I mean... Um... It was like you weren't interested to talk. It was the same while texting too. That was because, I'm not someone who carries my phone around. Also, I'm someone who doesn't plan or prepare much for anything. So there's always a lag cos of that. I guess that's the problem. I always need a plan before I do something. But when it came to this wedding... it was completely out of my hands! Was it that bad? Hey! Not that it was bad... Um... I'm confused, Haala. Is it about the black tea, sulaimani situation? Then why don't you just openly say it? I really cannot understand, that's why. You've not even saved my number. Of course, I'll be confused, Haala. Isn't it? It has only been... some 14 days... since we saw each other for the first and last time. In that span of time, for me to develop feelings of love, there should be that kind of moments between us. Doesn't matter if they're big or small. Of course, it does. But for that first we should want it, right? By talking... falling in love... and wanting to be with each other... That's what marriage is about, no? Did we get enough time for that? I was able to find plenty of time to talk to you. But you could never give me that kind of time. Haala, what I feel is, you were forced to agree to this marriage. Am I right? Ameen, don't be so judgemental. You think I don't have a choice or personality like you?! I... wasn't being judgemental. The reason I jumped over your wall in this ridiculous outfit tonight was definitely cos of the thrill and romance of such moments! Don't tell me you don't understand it. If this is how it's going to be, I don't think it'll go well. Don't force me to develop these emotions all of sudden. Oho! Am I the one forcing you now?! If you're not happy, speak to my brother. We can take our time, fall in love and then get married? Why couldn't you have said this ten days back?! Huh?! Before it got so out of hand! What do you want now? I should speak to your brother? I can speak to him. This is it, okay? It's over now! Let it not affect your personality. I can put an end to it! Enough? Why do you need all this light anymore! Jump.. jump! Watch your leg, Ami! Get in, Arun! People will see, man! Not here, over there! Arun, just come... and stop mucking around! -How many times do I tell you! -Why are you simply shouting at me?! -Ami, my dear! Tell me what all happened? -Nothing happened, man! This marriage won't happen! -Yeah, right! -What, man? Tell me, what's it? Watch where you're going! Drive carefully, man! Arun, just watch the back. Watch out! -Watch the back, dude! -I'm not able to see anything! Did we fall? -Try taking it out. -Yes, we fell. Didn't we tell him to watch the back! -Don't take it now! We are stuck! -What the... What happened, bro? Is the tyre stuck? Don't accelerate, you guys get out. We'll try pushing from the back. Get out. -Get out fast, so we can leave quickly! -So get out...

Fireworks have begun at Sulaikha Manzil. Won't have any peace of mind for the next two days. It's best to mute the group for a few days. Oh, dear God! Haala. Did you meet Ameen? Mm... Is there any problem? Mm-hmm. Oh, my God! Ameen is going to tell Sameer ikka... that this marriage won't happen. I'll be right back. Everybody! Attention please! My dear ones! Our... very own... bridegroom... Ameen and his friends. Has anyone here misinterpreted the purpose of their arrival on the eve of the wedding? You haven't, right? Therefore... just because of that... brother-in-law Ameen is going to do an amazing performance for us! But on one condition, no one should tag! -Ameen? -You sure, right? Be cool. What's it? Just say it. I'm going to tell Haala's brother that it won't happen. Stop kidding, man! -What are you doing... -My bro-in-law, Ameen! Welcome to the stage! Bring him! Come on, brother-in-law! Come. So let's begin! Shake a leg! Come on, start, bro-in-law! Everybody's in the mood! They're waiting! Start, bro-in-law! Start the music, Maju! Dance, brother-in-law!

What's it, Ithatha? What are they doing to that boy? It's fun, no! He's feeling awkward! Ask them to stop! That's what I've been saying too! Hey Adil! Moothumma, come here. Move, move. Their silly games! Move aside, man! Move, move! Stop it! Keep quiet, everyone! Be quiet! This is so disrespectful! What will that boy think of us? Aunty, we were only joking... Joking?! Son, I am around 50 years old. I've been to a lot of weddings and seen a lot of bridegrooms! But this is the first time I'm seeing a bridegroom like this! You are so impatient, my God! Oh, dear God, please protect my child! Don't mind that, Ameen! What did you do, Moothumma! So, let's begin! Son, she was joking, okay? Ameen! Ameen! Ameen! Hey, hey! Stop it! Ameen! Dance, man!
