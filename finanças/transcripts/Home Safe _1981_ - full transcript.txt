(suspenseful music) - [Boy] I'm scared, Mike. - So am I, Jeff, but that's what makes it fun. - [Jeff] What if it gets hungry? - [Mike] Oh, they'll just go eat chickens. They love chickens. So you better make sure he doesn't see you guys. You guys ready? See? I told you guys it would be easy. - What if we get caught? - Use your imagination, Jim. (tiger roars) (dramatic orchestra music) - [Boy] Chris, is it a sin to draw pictures of space ships? - [Boy] It is the way you draw 'em. - [Boy] How come you don't draw pictures of space ships anymore? - Jeff, do you remember when we were little, everything that I had you wanted? - Yeah, I remember. I remember how stingy you were. You wouldn't let me play with any of your toys. - What do you mean? I let you play with my baseball cards and you traded 50 of 'em for 20 firecrackers. - I did? I don't remember that. - Anyway, all that stuff isn't important anymore. - Can I have your baseball cards? - Sure, I guess. If you can find 'em. (lighthearted musics) - Oh, didn't know I still had these. - Jeff, I want to give you something and the only reason you haven't swiped it already is because you don't want to go to one of the places where you can get it. - Where is that? - Church. - [Mother] Boys. - We're comin', Mom. - What's it gonna be, Chris? - It's gonna be yours if you can hit a home run in little league. - Alright. - [Man On Radio] Proverbs 20:26 says, a wise king stamps out crime by severe punishment. What this nation needs. - Good morning, Mom. - Good morning. Why are you boys so late this morning? - It wasn't our fault. Dad woke us up too late. - [Man On Radio] Proverbs 11:4 says, your riches won't help you on judgment day. Only righteousness counts then. - Morning, Dad. - Morning. - Good morning. Jeff, don't wolf down that junk food. Eat something that's good for you first. - Like that health food bird seed that Chris eats? Yuck, I'd rather be dead. - Jeff, did you hear me? - Okay okay. - How long is grandpa gonna stay with us? - He didn't say. Maybe a few weeks. - [Jeff] Great. - A few weeks? - Honey, it says in Proverbs, he who is slow to anger hath great understanding. - Kathy, don't quote the Bible to me, okay? It's just that two weeks is gonna seem like two years. - I don't see how you can say that about your own father. Ollie Donovan is the sweetest, kindest man I know. - Yeah, you don't know him like I do. It's just, I can only stand so much of his opinions and answers about things he knows nothing about and when he tells those dumb stories to the boys about things I did when I was a kid. Come on, we better hurry out to the airport. Your granddad's probably talked his way into the cockpit. I want to see him land a 727. (airplane flying overhead) - [Jeff] Dad, is grandpa really flying that plane? - No, your dad was just teasing, honey. He was kidding about grandpa because grandpa likes to tell stories. - [Jeff] Dad, how come you don't like grandpa's stories? - Because your father's trying to forget some of the things he did when he was your age and your grandfather keeps reminding him. - Dad, does grandpa know that you're the new principal of the school? - Not unless you guys told him. - Mom, does grandpa know that you're a Christian now? - I don't think he does, honey. Maybe you and I could share Christ with him when he comes. - Grandpa, got any good stories? - Well, boys, as a matter of fact I do. I have a good story and good news. Now once upon a time and a long time ago the city of Springfield started plannin' a north south freeway. Now, as close as I can recollect, the 22nd street exit'll bring traffic down the hall through my kitchen down off the back porch and in July and August between my radishes and zucchini and since there really isn't room for radishes and rush hour traffic, I sold the house. - What? I didn't know. You didn't tell me anything about the house. Dad, where are you gonna live? - Well, that's the good news. Till I can find a place of my own, I'll come live with you. (tire blows out) - Jim, try not to let your father know you're angry. - Now why shouldn't he think I'm angry? I am angry. He sold the house. What kind of good news is that? - Um, how about if you three guys go for a nice long walk while Dad changes the tire, okay? - I can help. - No, you go with Grandpa and Jeff. You know how your dad is when he tries to do something like this. - Your dad never was very good with mechanical things. Did I ever tell you about the time he tried to fix. - He makes me so mad when he tells those stories. He'll miss most of what really happened to make the story funny. When he does tell the truth it makes me look like a nerd. - Just be calm. Everything's gonna be just fine, okay? What can I do to help? - Get the spare out of the back. - Little old lady McCoy, as we used to call her, had a little brown Plymouth Coupe. She used to drive back and forth to East Aurora in it to work, real rattle trap it was. Boy was it noisy. In fact, the only part about it that didn't make any noise was the horn (laughs). Anyway, Jim and a neighbor boy charged her a dollar a piece to fix it. Well, they got it all apart (laughs) and never did get it back together again (laughs). - Grandpa, you told me that story before and Grandma said she lost her job because of that. - Oh, I think he probably did her a favor, son. Probably saved her life. Why, every time she tried to start that car it'd backfire, sound like it was gonna blow up. - Remember what I said about two weeks seeming like two years? Well now it's actually gonna be two years, maybe more. - Oh no it isn't. Your dad said he'd start looking on Monday. - He said he'd start Monday. It's gonna be two years before he even finds anything. - Oh. (tired falls to ground) (dogs growling) - Get him, get him, just get him, just get him, just get him. Get him, get him. Mark, what have you been doing with this dog for the last month, anyway? He's not responding to anything. Crazy dog belongs in the pet shop. Get rid of him. Alright everybody, take a break. - Howdy. - How y'all doing? - Okay. - Good. - That dog sure is pretty. - He a nice one? - Someday I'm gonna have me a dog just like that. (lighthearted music) - Hey, what, what is this? What the? Somebody help me. - [Jeff] He likes you, Dad. - Whose dog is this, anyway? - He's ours, Dad. - Oh no, he's not ours. It's all I can do to tolerate the Thomson's tomcat. Now wherever you got him you. Where did you get him? I don't want to know. Take him back. - Aw, Dad, please. Why can't we keep him? - Because I said so and that's final and that's reason enough. - Quite handsome animal, isn't he, Jim? - Well he is a mighty fine lookin' dog. - Good, Dad likes him. - If we take this dog, you know who'll end up taking care of him, don't ya? - I will, Dad, honest I will. I will, I will. Please. - [Dad] Okay, Jeff, you're responsible the first time that dog causes any trouble. (playful music) (cat meows) (dog barks) - Hey. (suspenseful music) Hey, stop. - Somewhere in this viewing area a full grown tiger is on the loose. Police say some teenage boys actually pried open a padlock on the tiger cage at the city zoo. It happened last night. The big cat escaped. It's still at large but zoo officials seem to think they have the situation well in hand. They say they'll have that big kitty back in its cage by morning but I don't know, if I were you I'd lock my doors. - Mom, can we go to the movies tomorrow night? - [Mom] Have to ask your dad. - Come on, boy. Fetch it. - Jeff, what are you doing with your dad's slipper? - I'm trying to teach the dog to fetch Dad's slipper so he'll like him better. - Dad will like him better when he's been housebroken and when he stops running in the house. - [Jeff] Come on, boy. Fetch it. - I just heard on the radio that somebody let the tiger out at the zoo. Did they have the tiger story on TV yet, grandpa? - Yep. Sure don't know what gets into these young kids today. Why would they want to let a tiger loose? Might hurt somebody. Never did things like that when I was a boy. Ah, we used to paint the water tower, never hurt anybody. Mayor got peeved a lot, especially when we painted it purple and green. - Jeff, what are you doing? - If he can catch a smell he'll fetch Dad's slippers. - If can catch the smell, he'll bury Dad's slippers. - You should have seen Jeff trying to teach that dog how to fetch your slippers. - Well I would rather seen Jeff teach the dog where to do his business so he wouldn't do it under my desk in the study. Would you tell Jeff I don't want the dog in the house 'til he's house broken. - Jim, why do you always tell me what to tell the boys. You're the father. Tell Jeff yourself. - Yeah, what good would that do? I tell 'em something, they do what they want. I told them they couldn't have a dog. Now there's one in there doing his business at my desk. - Don't you get upset with me, James Donovan. You're the one who told the boys they could bring the dog home. - What else could I do? - You could have said no. - I did. - Yeah, four times. You know, all the boys have to do to get their own way is just say aw, Dad, please. You're a pushover. You know, it says in the Bible, I think it's in Hebrews, the Lord disciplines the ones he loves. Don't you love the boys? - Now wait a minute. This has gone a little bit too far. My Dad never laid a hand on me and I'm not gonna spank those boys. I don't care what the Bible says. Would you please be quiet, Kathy, so I can read the paper? - Okay, I'll be quiet. Can I say just one more thing? - You've said enough. - Aw, please Dad, mmhmm, just one more thing (laughs). Oh, I don't know all it says in the Bible about raising kids, but would you be willing to let the pastor come visit us so that he could talk to us about it? - Why can't we solve our own problems? - We are, but I think we could use some help. I think we need God's help. Maybe he could show us how to get it. Don't you want to have a happy family? - Yeah of course I do. - Don't you want the boys to know how to live? - Yes. - Can the pastor come visit? - Yes. If you think it'll help. - Oh, maybe the boys are a little old for spanking Chris, anyway, but we could establish some boundaries and stick to them, take away privileges. You pass of lightly what Jeff's doing with that dog but at least he's trying to discipline the animal and that's more than you're doing with the kids. Where are you going? - To the kitchen to read my paper. If you want to preach, preach to the dog. He isn't housebroken. I am. - Hey, is K9 a good name? - For what? - Our dog. (knock on doors) - Hi, boys. - Hi, grandpa. - Well, you came up with a name yet for that dog a yours? - What do you think about K9? - You mean like a K and a nine? - That's good, Chris, K9. That's real clever. You like that, Jeff? - Of course I like it. I thought of it. - Oh, well I think that's quite clever. - I'm clever with names. I named the python at our school. Know what I named him? - What? - Pete. - That's clever. - You got a python at school? - Yeah, you wanna go see him? - Oh sure. - Maybe tomorrow? - Tomorrow it is. - Grandpa, how come Dad doesn't like dogs? - Well, son, he got chased by a bull he was teasin' when he was about Chris' age and he's never been real fond of any animal since then. - Did you ever spank Dad? - No, I didn't. - Why? - Well, because I never thought he did anything to deserve one and besides, I don't believe in spankin's. - That's not what the Bible teaches. - Oh? What does the Bible teach? - Spare the rod and you spoil the child. - Well I don't agree at all with that malarkey. All this philosophy about disciplinin' kids when they're babies, my goodness. Let 'em be kids. There's plenty of time for gettin' serious in life. Plenty of time. - And speaking of time, it's about time for you boys to get to sleep. It's getting late. - Jeff, don't want you talking all night. Got a big game tomorrow, okay? Good night. - Good night, Mom. Good night, Grandpa. - Grandpa? Tomorrow do you want to tell us the story about the bull that chased Dad? - Sure. Good night, boys. - Good night. - Speaking of malarkey, do you have any idea what you said in there? - Oh? - Shh. - What did I say that was wrong? - Well for starters, you told the boys that the Bible is fiction. And the very scripture that you denied as truth is what you should have used as a foundation for raising your own children. - I don't understand. - You spared the rod and spoiled the child who is now my husband and he's the father of two children, who Lord willing are going to grow up to have their own children and they're not going to have any idea at all how to discipline them because Jim's not teaching them. - I'm sorry I upset you so, Kathy. - I am upset. Telling those stories which Jim resents, they're destructive, Dad. I think you resent Jim's behavior as a boy because you know it was partly your own fault and so you try to cover up for it by making light of it. - Jim never obeyed me when he was a boy. He did as he pleased. I never could do anything with him. - You never taught him. You think boys are supposed to fish and build tree houses. Of course they should, but Jim fished in a fish hatchery which was illegal and what did you do about it? Nothing. You thought it was okay, boys will be boys. You think that you can teach boys to obey when they're 12 or 15, that's too late, Dad. My father started on me when I was a toddler and I had security in knowing where my boundaries were. Believe me, when I challenged my father's authority he straightened me out real quick and when he sent me away to think about it I had to think about it standing up because I couldn't sit down. And when I asked my mom and dad who loved me, they made it very clear. I'm trying to teach those boys eternal values and Jeff is not responding. I need Jim's help and I'm not getting it. I love you very much, Dad, but you are not to tell any more of those stories about Jim's boyhood pranks. - Hey, did Grandpa ever tell you the story about Dad one year at camp? - No, I bet it's good though. - Well, Dad called the state police and told them that he saw a bright orange and yellow object with blinking red and white lights and little people were getting off. - Dad saw a UFO? - Are you kidding? When the state police got there they found a school bus. - [Man On Radio] In other news at this hour, the tiger that was released by juveniles from the children's zoo last night is still at large. The police are advising that pets stay secure. A large Labrador retriever was attacked and killed this morning at the home of Jack Niles at 1440 Northwest Bank. - Chris? - Jeff, go to sleep. - I have something to tell you. - Tell me tomorrow. - But, I have to tell you now but if I tell you, you promise you won't tell anybody? - What is it? - Promise? - I promise. - Well, Mike DeForce let the tiger out of the zoo. - What? How do you know? - I helped him do it. - Jeff, are you crazy? I'm surprised his parents let you stay out that late. - Well his folks weren't home. - Why'd you do it? - Well, I just wanted to show the guys that I was tough just like they were. - That was dumb, Jeff, really dumb. I mean, that was dumb. - Seems dumb now but you should have seen that tiger when he. - You know something, Jeff? - What? - That's why you won't receive Christ, isn't it? - What do you mean? - You're afraid of what your friends'll think. - I guess so. Didn't you ever have that problem? - I lost just about all my friends, Jeff, but that proved they weren't really my friends. When Jesus Christ became my best friend he introduced me to a lot of his friends. - Like Brad and Kevin and Greg? - Jeff? - Hmm? - What if you died in your sleep tonight? - I won't. - Yeah, I know, but what if you did? Would you go to Heaven? (thud) - Ow, ow, ow. Ah. (suspenseful music) (dog barking) (cat meows) (dog barking) (cabinet rattling) (thud) - [Man On Radio] This is the day that the Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. - Good morning, dear. - Good morning. - What happened to you? What was all that racket last night? - Pass the butter, please. - Cut yourself shaving, Dad? - No, I didn't cut myself shaving. - What the bandaid on your forehead? - I bet you it was from that tiger. - Jeff, stop being silly and eat your eggs before they get cold. - The cat next door. - Toby? Toby did that? - I didn't catch the name. - Must have been a viscous little rascal. - Claws like ice picks. - Can Chris, Grandpa and I go down to the school with you to see Pete? - Who's Pete? - Oh, the python in the science lab. - Oh. I thought you had a game today. - Yeah, at 12:30. - Don't forget the pastor's coming over after the game today. - I didn't forget. - Grandpa? And after the game will you go down the creek with me and tell me the rest of the story about the bull? - Well. - What are you telling 'em that story for? - Don't worry, that's taken care of. - Why not, Mom? - Because it's not funny and you don't need to hear it. - Come on, Grandpa. I'll show you a new trick I taught K9. - Jeff, I don't want you running in the house or that dog either. I mean it now. - I'm sorry about teasing you about last night, Dad. I didn't mean to embarrass you in front of Grandpa. - You know, I'm getting rid of that nuisance first thing in the morning. - Jim, how can you talk like that? He's your father. - I'm talking about the dog. - Well, if you're serious about the dog you better tell Jeff before you change your mind. - I'm not gonna change my mind this time. (door slams) (dog barks) - K9. - Jeffrey Kay Donovan, I told you not to do that. How many times do I have to tell you? - I gotta get the slipper before he buries it. - Oh, Jim, would you please make him mind? He won't listen to me. - Stop, K9. - Whoa, whoa, fella. Now, you can't run the bases if you're all worn out. I want to talk to you about K9. - Can't it wait? I almost got him trained. - Yeah, for what, the Kentucky Derby? - Come on, Dad, I'm trying to teach K9 to fetch your slippers. - At the rate you're going I'll have to chase him through the house to get 'em. - Dad, it takes time and I'm really workin' hard at it and I need your support. Please, Dad? - Go on (laughs). Did you hear that? - I heard it. I'm still waiting. - For what? - Remember that get rid of the dog speech? - Maybe we should give the boys some more support. Maybe we're expecting too much too soon. Maybe the dog is catching on. I mean, did you see? He did have the slipper in his mouth. - And if Jeff hadn't been chasing after him he would have probably buried the slipper the same place he buried the other one. - [Boy] Alright, come on. - [Umpire] Play ball. (cheers) (applause) - [Dad] Come on, Jeff. Come on, kid. (crowd cheers) - [Coach] Come on, Jeff. Come one, come on, come on. Go, Jeffrey, go go. - [Umpire] You're out. - Hey, sneakers, if you would have listened to your coach you might have scored. - Do you boys know what the word obedience means? Donovan, I told you to run and for a minute you thought you were smarter than me. All you had to do was listen to what I had to say and you just might have made it home safe. Boys, you can't play the game alone. Any questions? Dismissed. - Coach? - Yeah? - I need new spikes. I can't run in these old shoes. - Jeff, you can't go through life making excuses for everything that goes wrong. You gotta make do with what you have. - Yes, sir. - Get rid of those gym shoes, Donovan, and you might be able to run better. - Billings, Harris, next game you guys are bat boys. - Ah, coach. - Two games. - Jeff, I really think you got the potential to be one of the best ball players in our team but you don't listen. You just run around doing your own thing. We're gonna work on that, okay? - Yes, sir. - Alright. ♫ Was a hazy lazy summer day ♫ No breeze ♫ Big game today, Pop ♫ Pass the butter please ♫ Did you know the guys made fun of me ♫ 'Cause I play in tennis shoes ♫ If I only had some spikes, Dad ♫ We'd probably never lose - Grandpa, is that what Old Lady McCoy's car looked like? - Oh, no. No actually, this one seems much nicer. - Grandpa? If there were more gas in here and we dropped a match in it this baby would blow sky high. - (Laughs) Well actually, son, there's more explosive power in that can because of all the fumes. Now don't you go gettin' any ideas. I threw a firecracker into an old milk can once when I was a kid. It had gas fumes in it. Almost burned the barn down (laughs). - Thank you so much. - Thanks, honey. - You're welcome. - Kathy, Jim, you just can't imagine how very nice it is to be here in your home today. I've looked forward to this and I think you so much for the invitation but I certainly hope there's no problem. - Well we feel we'd like to raise our boys according to scriptural principles but I guess we just don't know exactly how to go about it. - Kathy and I don't agree on this discipline thing. I know she means well but when she spouts Bible verses at me about how to handle the kids. - Jim, I know exactly what you mean. New Christians are almost always like that. You see, Kathy is so excited about Jesus Christ and she wants you to know that same kind of excitement. Kathy, let me give you my Bible and I'd like for you to turn, if you would, to Zachariah chapter four and verse six and I think you'll find that it really relates to what we're talking about. Jim, while she's doing that, let me just reaffirm a real commitment I have to the word of God because I believe in that book is all the information we need to raise our children. You see, in the book of Proverbs alone, God gives so much wisdom on how to raise children and I really believe if you and Kathy would seek out that wisdom from the Bible together that God would give you perfect agreement on how to raise your sons. - I've got it. - Good, Kathy. Would you look at the second part of that verse and read it for us. - Not by might nor by power but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord of hosts. - Grandpa, would you tell me the story about the bull that chased Dad? - Well, Jeff, your mother doesn't want me telling you boys any more stories. - Ah, come on, Grandpa. Last night you said you would. - Well, if I do you won't tell your mother. - I promise. - Well, son, I guess your dad thought it'd be exciting to get a bull to chase him. Now it was winter, you understand. Jim's idea was to get off just a few yards from the old pond and get the bull mad. Jim had baseball cleats on. He'd get that bull chasing him right out onto the ice. (Laughs) When that bull hit the ice, Jim said it was the funniest thing he ever saw (laughs). I'd ask him not to do that 'cause it was dangerous but your dad was 15 and figured he could take care of himself so he did it anyway. At one point he got his shoestring tangled in some barbwire that was frozen in the ground. That bull almost got him. - What happened? - Well, he pulled loose and got out onto the ice but he hit a soft spot and fell in and that bull went in almost on top of him. - What happened to the bull? - Well, the bull couldn't get out, Son, and it drowned. - Well, Dad should have listened to you. I wouldn't do a thing like that. (suspenseful music) - I guess I tend to raise the kids the way my dad raised me. - Jim that's fine if your father raised you according to God's principles, but if he didn't and you try to raise your sons his way or any other way, then it could lead to disaster. You see, that's what breaks my heart today as a pastor and I counsel with people and I see so many who are trying to live according to their own way, forgetting God's way, and they're ending up so miserable. Any time we live life and forget God's commands then we have to ask ourselves what we're willing to sacrifice. Maybe it's health or life or eternity, maybe even our family. - You don't pull any punches, do you? - Jim, I really care about you and your wife and your family and I believe this is serious business. - What do I have to do? - If you really want to build your family around Biblical principles, then you must first of all make a commitment to Jesus Christ, because if you try to follow all these principles and you don't know the Lord, it very well may not work, and the Bible says that the way we receive Christ is to confess with our mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe in our heart that God has raised him from the dead then make a commitment of your life, of your family. (soft piano music) - Well, I certainly will think about that, Pastor, and I appreciate your taking the time to come by. - Thank you. - Hey, Dad. There's an ad in today's paper for new condominium for sale over at River Hills. - Well I actually was thinkin' about something close to the water. - Hey, great, it's right by the river. It's a beautiful spot down there. - Of course you get all them mosquitoes you get too close to the water. - Close your windows, use insect repellent. No place is perfect. - I know what I want, Jim, and I can afford it. I'll find it. - Jim, you know you need to trim those hedges so they can insulate the north wall. - I'll do that after supper. - Dad, have you thought about my new baseball shoes? - Jeff, it's just been a few hours since you asked me that. - Well how long do you need? - Tell you what, you hit a home run and I'll buy you those baseball shoes. - Really? Boy, if I hit a home run it'll be just like Christmas around here. Are we going to the school today? - Yes, but I've got some things to do around here first. Go outside and play and be back by 3 o'clock. I don't want to come looking for ya. - Can K9 come with us? - You know animals aren't allowed in the school. - Well it's Saturday. Who would know? - I'd know. I'm the principal, remember? - Well then, can he just stay outside? - I guess. (suspenseful music) - Dad, can he stay in the lobby where it's cool? - No, Jeff, he has to stay outside. Here's the key to the science lab. Don't lose it, okay? - I'll catch up with you guys in a minute. I gotta tie my shoe. (dog whimpers) (dog barks) (suspenseful music) - So this is Pete? - Boy, if Mom ever saw a snake that big she'd faint bigger than life. (suspenseful music) - What do you feed it? - Rabbits. In the jungle it eats mostly wild pigs and it can even eat a small deer. - Now, is it poisonous? - No, it suffocates its prey. We better get going. (dog barks) (suspenseful music) (crash) (dog barking) - Okay okay, just a minute. (suspenseful music) - [Man On Radio] Children need to be taught responsible behavior and how to face obligations. - Stay here, not there, here. - [Man On Radio] Children thrive in an atmosphere of genuine love and understanding undergirded by constant discipline. Discipline to a child is security. Nothing brings a child any closer to a parent than for the father or mother to win decisively. Parents who demonstrate their authority build respect. Proverbs 1:29 says, you close your eyes, you must expect the bitter fruit of having your own way. When there is no authority behind your words kids will tune you out. Proverbs also says, do not withhold discipline from a child. If you punish him he will not die. - [Man On Radio] It's been several days since the tiger escaped and in spite of an intensive city-wide man hunt, this phantom tiger is nowhere to be found. Officials had speculated that the animal had left the city but this afternoon the carcass of another dog was found just a few yards from the Evergreen Park playground. To add to the dilemma, a python named Pete was stolen over the weekend from the Franklin Junior High School. Police think it may be the same vandals who let the tiger escape. (soft music) - Hey, Jeff? Did Dad say anything to you about the snake? - Yeah, he was all uptight because we were in the science lab around the time that it had happened. I don't know anything about it. I left when you did. Hey, a baseball picture. That's gonna be neat. Chris, can I ask you some questions about Heaven? - Heaven? How come all the sudden you want to talk about Heaven? - I just do. - You haven't given up on me, have you? - Given up on you? - Well since the pastor was here you've been awfully quiet with the Bible verses. Oh, I've got something I want to read to you. Listen to this. It's called, Where Have All the Fathers Gone. Attitudes fostered by misguided liberals taught in our schools today are reflected in family breakdown. There's no strong authority figure, no more absolutes today. Bitterly resenting the absence of the father who never exercised any authority, young people lash out at father figures, those in authority such as police officers, school officials and world leaders. Today, so many homes are broken that kids' values are disjointed. There are not many paths left for values to be passed down from generation to generation. If Pastor Alan hadn't ben here and talked about that very thing I probably wouldn't have paid much attention to it. I think I'm beginning to understand. (cheers) - [Umpire] You're out. - Jeff, you did okay, fella. You tried and that's what counts. One of these days we're gonna get you home safe. (soft music) - Who so despiseth the word shall be destroyed, but he that furthereth the commandment shall be rewarded. Hey, wow. ♫ You know we to trim the hedge, dear ♫ I'll tell you, son ♫ I'm gonna buy you some baseball shoes ♫ If you can hit a home run ♫ No go outside and play ♫ But be back by three ♫ Then we'll see you earn those spikes, son ♫ How about some more iced tea (splash) (tiger roars) - K9. (tiger and dog fighting) (dramatic music) (explosion) K9, K9, K9, K9. (dog panting) Come on, let's go home. Let's go home. (slow orchestra music) ♫ I'm in the mood for love ♫ Simply because you're near me ♫ Funny but when you're near me ♫ I'm in the mood (shrieks) ♫ Why stopped and see ♫ This little dream might fade ♫ We put our hearts together (screams) ♫ Now we are one ♫ I'm not afraid ♫ That there's a cloud above (screams) ♫ But for now I forget it - Mrs. Donovon? - Yes. - I'm Tim Conrad from the school board. - Oh yes, come on in. It's nice to meet you. Jim is in the living room. - Thank you. - Oh hi, Tim. - Jim. - How are ya? - Just fine. - Come in, sit down. - Jim, I came to talk to you about your dog. - My dog? - Jim, I'm sure you're aware that animals are not allowed in the school building. - Of course I'm aware of that. - The dog has been in the building a number of times, including the cafeteria, which is in violation of state law. It's violated the cleanliness of our athletic fields more than once. Well, I could go on, but the reason I'm here is that Harley Mitchell told me that he let the dog out of the school lab Saturday afternoon. - I wasn't aware of that. - Jim, we have a large snake loose in that building. If it's not found over the weekend I'm going to have to close the school Monday. If we have to close the school, the board has no choice but to dismiss you. (somber music) My advice to you, if this is resolved, is to get rid of that dog. It's not worth the trouble it's causing. - Where's my slipper? I'm getting fed up with this. Where's my other slipper? - Oh, that's my fault. Jeff's still trying to teach K9 to bring your slippers. - So why is it your fault? - Well because K9 usually ends up burying the slipper and I usually remember to dig it up and today I forgot. - Don't try to be cute. I'm not in the mood for it, okay? - I'm not being cute, I'm being serious. - I don't believe this, I really don't believe this. It's been nothing but trouble in this house ever since that dog came and now I'm about to lose my job because of it. I'm getting rid of that dog as soon as possible. - [Mom] Oh, Jim, you can't do that. - Oh no? Watch me. And I'll tell you something else I'm tired of and that's my dad here in this house. I've had it. You know he's done absolutely nothing about finding a place to live? And I'm tired of him brainwashing the kids into thinking I was some kind of teenage Al Capone. I want him out of this house, too. - Jim, do you have any idea what you're saying? I can understand about the dog but Ollie is your father. No matter what he is your father. - He's a troublemaker and I resent what he's done to our lives, Kathy. - Well maybe I just resent what you're doing to my life, Jim. - Oh? And what's that supposed to mean? - You, you were the troublemaker. You broke your mother's heart just one time too many. As a child you humiliated me. You never did what you were told. You always did just as your darn well pleased. - Why didn't you make me behave? Why didn't you teach me? You were no father. You didn't have the guts to tell me when I was wrong. You didn't teach me how to be a father to my boys and I resent that. Pack your bags and get out. - You're blaming me now for your troubles, hmm? - You're dog gone right I am. Who else is to blame? - Look in the mirror, son. Look in the mirror. You aren't much of a man if you're not even able to take the responsibility to correct your own life. I tried to bring you up the way your grandfather did me. So now I suppose I can blame him for my failure and his dad, and how far back do you want to go? - Oh, it's gone far enough. Keep this up and you'll both be taking your sin all the way back to Adam. You're both wrong, you're both disobedient. In God's eyes you've disobeyed his instructions and now you're reaping the consequences. Now both of you just go to bed. - Chris? - What? - Do you think if I was a Christian I wouldn't get in so much trouble? - I don't know. It's up to you, I guess. I know a lot of Christians who get into trouble because they're too lazy to learn God's instructions let alone live by 'em. Jeff, if you become a child of God you get two things: you get eternal life in Heaven and a book of instructions that tells you how you can live a successful life here on earth. A lot of Christians will be in Heaven but they won't be happy on earth because they don't follow God's plan. Tell Jesus you're sorry for your sins and ask him to forgive you. Invite him into your life and forget about what your friends will think. He can help you be a better ball player. - He can? - Yes, 4918 Elm Street. Yes, okay, and hurry, please. - Why is everybody up so early? - Well I got up to find the snake. It looks like your brother go up to run away with K9. - Well where's Mom? - I guess she went to find Jeff. (suspenseful music) (dog panting) - [Man On Radio] And while the city council is proposing that the road be closed immediately, the residents in the area. - I have no idea where he may have gone. He's never done this before. - Do you have an approximate time when he left? - Sometime late last night or early this morning. - Any place he might go? Any friends he'd be with or anywhere to hide out? - Chris? - Hmm, I don't know of any one place. - [Man On Radio] A farmer in East Aurora told state police about an hour ago that he spotted the tiger out by the old convent farm just a mile west of town. Officials are beginning to fear that the odds are now very much in favor of someone being injured or killed. A curfew is going into effect tonight beginning at 6 o'clock. There was a one car accident earlier this morning. - Where are those light switches? (dog barks) (suspenseful music) (puff of air) (shriek) Oh. (dog barks) Okay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil. (gasps) My rod and my staff, they comfort me. - Come on, K9. Let's make a fort so they can't catch us. Come on, K9. Come on. Come on, K9. (suspenseful music) (tiger roars) K9. K9. (dog barks) K9. K9. Help. (dog barks) - We have a nine year old runaway boy. He's about four foot five inches tall. He's got blonde hair, brown eyes and someone has reported a kid of that description around the old convent farm. (suspenseful music) - K9. (dog barks) - Have you checked all the out buildings yet for the tiger? - We checked the school but no one's checked the farm. (dog barks) (police sirens) (dog and tiger fighting) - Help K9. The tiger's in there. Dad. (tiger roaring) - I'll get on the radio. (tiger panting) - Well we were worried about you, son. - Glad you're alright, Jeff. - We should have some help out here in a few minutes then we'll try to get your dog out. - Well is he alright? - Well I don't know if he's just hurt or exhausted. - Are you gonna shoot the tiger? - No, son, not if we can help it. He's just scared and hungry and we just want to try to get him back home to where he belongs. Stay radio from 140. (suspenseful music) (snake hisses) (gasps) - Stupid boy. (shrieks) - Thank goodness. Don't move. He won't hurt ya. - I found Pete. - You go upstairs, call Mr. Walters, tell him you found his snake and I'll stay here with old Pete. - Thank you. - It's been what, three weeks now since old K9 here become a hero? - Uh huh. He outta be able to resume slipper trainin' here before two long. - Yeah, his legs are still a little bit stiff but he can still run good. - Now son, I'm expecting you to hit a home run out there today. It can be my going away present. - I'll try, Grandpa. (cheers) - [Umpire] Play ball. - Come on, kid. Alright. - Come on, bud, come on, come on, come on bud. (bat hits ball) (cheers) - That a way to hit, Jeff. All the way, all the way, let's move it, let's move it. (cheers) (bat hits ball) (cheers) - Kathy, would you tell Jeff to hurry up. Have you seen the keys? - I have the keys. Jeff, hurry up, we're waiting. He is so excited about getting those shoes. Jeff, stop running in the house with that dog. (crash) (suspenseful music) Jeff. (ambulance sirens) (somber music) ♫ Was a hazy lazy summer day, no breeze ♫ Yell for Jeff it's time to go, hon ♫ Have you seen my keys ♫ Jeff come on over now ♫ And don't you find the Thomsons fast ♫ I'll bet he runs full speed ♫ It's so hot, kids have no sense ♫ The crash was all so loud ♫ But so was mama's scream ♫ Little Jeff hit the play glass first ♫ Then the wire screen ♫ He forgot the sliding door was shut ♫ Dear God, the blood was all over the glass ♫ Our son, his tiny baseball glove - Jim, let's just talk. Let's just talk it all out, okay? - How can you be so composed? - God, I killed my own son (sobbing). - I see a spark of hope in what you just said, you know that? Because you've been blaming your father. - What difference does it make? Nothing'll bring him back, anyway. - It does matter. To you and your father it's the beginning of putting two lives back together. - He blamed me for my mother's death. You heard him when he said that. - So what are you going to do, lay the guilt for Jeff at his feet? An eye for an eye? - Kathy, I can't take this anymore. Where did I go wrong? Everything was fine 'till Dad came. - I think Pastor Alan answered that question a few weeks ago, Jim. Satan was the head of our household but we were safe in his arms. He didn't bother us because we were asleep and when I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior I think he began to resist my efforts because he didn't want you and Jeff to seek Christ. I think he even worked through your dad, Jim, to upset us, telling those lies, disrupting the harmony of our lives, but through all that, even through Jeff's death, God is fighting to save our family, Jim, fighting to save Ollie, to save you for eternity. God wants to help, Jim, but we have to ask him. We have to let him. Jeff's death is forcing you and your father to look at this ugly problem of sin and disobedience. - You mean Jeff's death had something to do with this mess between Dad and I? - Ollie's dad failed him as a father because he didn't teach him to live according to God's principles. Ollie couldn't teach you and you couldn't teach Jeff how to live according to God's principles. When we ignore God, Jim, we pay the consequences. - You mean God sacrificed our son for me? - God sacrificed his son for your sake. Jim, your heart is sinful. You need a savior. Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life, and nobody comes to the father but by me. Oh Jim, Jesus is the only one who can help you carry this burden. Don't hold onto this sin. Don't you remember how Pastor Alan told you to do it? - Yeah, I remember. Oh, Lord, I confess to you with my mouth, that Jesus is Lord (sobbing). I truly believe that God raised you from the dead. I need you in my life. I sincerely beg you for forgiveness for my pride. Oh God, please, help me know where my son is. I've got to know (sobbing). Amen. - Amen. - Oh, Kathy (sobbing). - Kathy, I'm ready to go. - Dad, we want you to stay. (soft music) - Oh, I love you, son. - I love you, too, Dad. Please forgive me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. I didn't realize I. - It's okay, it's all over, it's all over. - Son, forgive me, but I'm confused about what's happened. Help me to understand what's going on. - Dad, I think I got a lot of answers to a lot of questions. I'd sure like to share 'em with you. - Jim, Ollie, can you come upstairs for a minute. - Jeff gave his life to Christ right here in this room about a month before he died. - Praise God. Jeff is home. Kathy, when I asked Jesus into my life, I asked him to tell me where Jeff was, remember? - I remember. - That prayer was answered. I am forgiven. - Even K9's been forgiven. - That was the hardest part of all. - What's happening here? Whatever it is, it's good. - Dad, you know at this very moment I just realized that there's no way Jeff can come back to me but I can go to him. When I accepted Jesus Christ into my life it cleared my eyes and I can plainly see that Jeff's death is not an eternal tragedy. It's just a separation. All our sin has been made right by God through his son Jesus Christ whose death on the cross has made it possible for you and Kathy and Chris and I to all be together with Jeff again for all eternity. ♫ And now with his new baseball shoes ♫ He lives beyond this grave ♫ For he had run GOd's bases well ♫ And slid in home plate safe ♫ Ah ♫ Home safe ♫ Oo
