Moishe! I'm home! Moishe! Moishe? Moishe? Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Moishe... Moishe? Ow. It's crunch time for the final-- I'll still be behind the counter... It's crunch time for the final three. Because we don't want anything to distract from this beautiful face. Oh, Hannah, we're going to need you in place in 20 seconds. 20 seconds, oh, thank you. You're doing a wonderful job. Oh, it's crunch time. You're sure that it's just a sprained knee? Oh, yeah, that's what the doctor said. It's crunch time for the-- Mm-hmm. Oh, I can't do this. Well, not with that face. Smile, Hannah! Come on-- Hannah, you are a trouper. We have 10 seconds. Well, it's our contest, right, Mason? Yeah, and if you need anything from us here at WNKW, my employees are at your service-- Okay, thank you, wonderful-- We just want to make it as easy as possible for you. You're doing a great job, by the way-- Yes, she is. Thank you, Mason, everyone here has been great. Where's my crème fraîche? Hannah! Focus. Smile. I can't smile the whole time, Mother. I mean, my lips have to move. "It's Crunch Time for the Final Three!" Wow, you're good at this, you should do it-- - And we're back in five-- - No, honey, it's your contest. - It's your moment. Shine. ---Four, three-- Oh, crutch! We're joined now by a special guest, owner of The Cookie Jar on Main Street in Eden Lake, and creator of the baking contest the whole town is buzzing about. - Yes, it's-- - Yes, it's Crunch Time for our Final Three this week in the Eden Lake Flour Bake-off. Hannah? That's right, it's crunch time for the... final... for the final three, and, uh... and they're gonna be baking. Smells like you've baked something for a preview for us? I did. I did, I-I I'm... making you Strawberry Shortcake Swenson. I-I posted the recipe on the website for pound cake, which is the base, and then I'm going to show you how to whip crème fraîche and finish it with the berry. Okay, while you get started, let's introduce our fellow contest judges, who are here with us today. We are delighted to welcome Clayton Hart. He is the owner of Eden Lake Flour Company. Thank you, it's a great pleasure to be here. Hi, Hannah. And manager of Eden Lake Inn restaurant, Charles Rutledge. So, you mix all the ingredients together, and you want to be sure not to over-work the batter, because that makes the cake too dense. - Good to know. - That's true. So let me show you the finished product here-- Oh, my gosh! That's fantastic! Whoo! That looks so good, it should be illegal. It is illegal-- to my diet. Let's try some. And I have some to sample. There you go. I forgot, you're supposed to finish it with mint. Hannah... you're setting a high bar for these contestants. We'll be meeting them in our next segment. Well, all those bakers are competing for $25,000 and a cover story in "Chef's Magazine." The contest takes place at Eden Lake High school, where we are on location all week for this special event, so come on down Saturday, doors open at 4:00. We'll be right back after these messages. And we're on a break! I can't hear anything. There's too many people talking. I thought that was my line, the "crunch time." You handled it well, though. Great job, and that was excellent. Thanks. Okay. And we'll see you two on Saturday. Yes, absolutely, Mr. Hart. And you take care of that leg. Of course I will, Mr. Rutledge. Oh... - Mother-- - That was so wonderful. You have a new calling, honey. Oh, I don't know about that-- I'm so proud. And I know that face. You go talk to him. Hi, Mike. Oh, a star has just been born! Hey, you didn't look gimpy at all. Thank you. Look, I'd be happy to come by and fix the stairs myself if Dennis isn't available. Yeah, no, I did, I talked to Dennis, and he's gonna come and double-reinforce the whatever-it's-called, and put extra-strut-slats on something, and double bolts, everything that you said, Mike. Yeah? Well, yeah, I wrote it all down. Well, look, about the game tomorrow, unfortunately, I am on duty. I am very sorry about that, but at least that means that Bill and Andrea can go. - That's really nice of you. - In five, four, three... The Eden Lake Rebels take on the Marshalls at home tomorrow, and the town will be out in full force for this one because this could be the night all-star point guard Carl Kimball breaks the record for the most points in a season. I am gonna manage your career, Hannah-- Mother, I don't know about that. Oh, my goodness, Hannah, what happened? Oh, I hope it's not broken. Can you still judge? - I'm okay. - Yes, she can taste. It's just her sprained knee, which she fell down her cellar steps I told her to have fixed... how many times? You did. Many, many times. Well, good luck with your promo. Yes, you guys, it is so much fun-- - Ready for your close-up? - Mother! That woman never stops talking. It could be a big break for you, too. It's a fun contest and a nice change of pace, but that's it. You don't give yourself enough credit. You have a real presence on camera. I'm happy being a restauranteur. How about I cook something for you-- If you promise not to judge the dish. Well, I do need the practice. I don't know, you're pretty good at judging. I tell you what, though, if you use any of that crème fraîche, I will give you definitely high marks. Okay. ...This one, because this could be the night all-star point guard Carl Kimball... What an athlete. I am really looking forward to watching this kid play. This'll be a great game. Get open. Get open, guys. Let's go, let's go, let's go. You got this, you got this. Way to go, buddy! You're back-up, okay? Way to go, Carl! Come on, Carl, let's go! A little defense. Up, up, up, Rebels! Hey, did, uh... Hey, did Norman give up dentistry? Oh, no, of course not. No, he volunteers his time. He's the assistant coach. Oh. Okay. Shoot it! Who is that? That is Carl Kimball. Oh! Oh, Mason Kimball's son. Yeah, yeah, he's an all-star-material kid, that guy. Mason and I are working together on that bake-off. Yeah, he's the station manager at WNKW. Pass it! Since when did you become such a big fan? Uh, I am out of the house, and there are no diapers. Sports Talk equals Adult talk. Hey, what's Bill working on? Like, a case? What? Show her. Big-big case. Big case. Show her. It's a totally normal precaution. Sure. You have a Granny-Cam? Yeah. Yeah, and look. Half an hour past bedtime. She's gonna be grumpy. She's a baby. She's gonna go to sleep when she needs to. Get over it. Great job, great job. You played great defense, and I'm so proud of you. Get outta here. That was so awesome... Hannah! Oh, hey. - Change of plans. - What? I just got the call before tip-off. George Rutledge has food poisoning, he can't judge the bake-off later. You're kidding. It's okay, it's all covered. Coach Bishop agreed to step in. Oh, that's great news. Yeah. I'd like to go thank him. Is that okay? Great idea. Great game, huh? Yeah, that was amazing. Oh, I-- So, tomorrow, we do three-on-threes-- Coach? Sorry to interrupt. Good game. Hey, good job, guys. That was super fun to watch. Um, listen, I just wanted to say thank you. Mason told me that you're going to help us with the bake-off contest? Your wife, Michelle, and I are-- Friends. Yeah, no, she, uh, she mentioned. I have tons of information about the contestants and the contest we have coming up... Uh, I'm not doing homework for this. Excuse me. Oh. Okay. Hey. Oh, hey, Norman. Great game. Yeah, wasn't it? Yeah, it was fantastic-- Hey, Josh, hold up a sec. Hey! Reynolds! I gotta talk to him real quick. Oh, sure. We'll catch up in a minute. Yeah, okay. See you later. What's going on? That boy's a champion! Why wouldn't you start Carl Kimball? He shouldn't be playing off the bench. I know! Thank goodness Coach came to his senses. Kimball was benched for a whole game! I know! Thank goodness we didn't lose that week-- But we didn't lose when Josh started, and he played a great game. Oh, Ms. Reynolds, I-I-- This is high school! All of these boys should get the chance to play! Uh, y-yes. We've obviously offended the woman. Well, she's had a hard life... Sorry, Bill stopped to talk to a friend. Hey... think that's who Mother says Norman's been dating? Maybe. They must have met when he started coaching. Are you okay with that? Of course I am! How's Mike? Good. Great. I think. Well, we don't spend a lot of time together 'cause of work or whatever. Well, you guys got to get a move on. His wife passed away a few years ago, maybe he's not ready. Does he say that? It's just very new, okay? Okay, but you guys are going to run out of time. And that was rude, and I didn't mean to say-- I'm sorry, I'm channeling Mother. It's okay, you have an excuse. You are a mother now. Thank you. - Love you. - Love you. Drive safe. Yup. Good luck with the contest today. Welcome, everyone, to the semi finals of the Eden Lake Flour Bake-off. We have a new judge to welcome tonight. Please welcome Coach Leonard Bishop. Very excited to be here. I'll turn it over to you, Hannah. Thanks, Dee. Let's meet our chefs. Okay, give me a single on Hannah... ...To earn money for culinary class... That's great. Now he's an assistant pastry chef at Chez Giselle in Minneapolis, Jeff Graham. I'm in it to win it. This baker has a degree from the Culinary Institute in New York-- Light the three-shot to the contestant, and tight on Hannah. Okay, save that for sure/ And his dream is to open his own restaurant. Lowell Mantes. Honored to be here. Thank you. And last, but by no means least, this contestant has baked for three generations of her family, and provided winning recipes to the annual Eden Lake Cookbook many times. Mrs. Lorraine Houser. Winning it! Thank you. So, you want to tell me why you're making such a big deal out of this? You're the one who's making a big deal out of this. Because you can't even bother to hide what you've been doing. There's nothing to hide. I know there's someone else! Not here, okay? Do you want to humiliate me? You're embarrassing yourself. Don't you dare walk-- Michelle, I-- Well, no guts, no glory. I had olives in my mystery box, and I had to use them. Well, I thought the sweet and salty were fighting for balance a bit, but the fig really helped. It's like a fruit cake that's been dragged through a pile of mulch. Well, I, um, I liked the texture of the cake. Yeah. Here I thought you were a professional. That's a JV effort, at best. Judges, do you have a decision? Yes, we do. I'm sorry to say, Lowell, you have been eliminated. I'm grateful I had the chance to compete. Thank you. Good effort. Boys, let's talk about tomorrow's practice. So, I'm going to need the best from you. Hey... Norman! Sorry I couldn't talk to you earlier. I had to deal with something. Oh, that's okay. I know you've been burning it at both ends with your practice and coaching. Yeah. Yeah, well, it'll be great when the high school can actually afford to hire an assistant coach. Yeah, I'm sure. Tell me about Coach Bishop. Is he... Is he always so nasty? I don't know, I mean, these days, yeah. I don't know what's going on with him, honestly. ...Because second best is just not going to cut it. Hey, Len. What are you doing? Just making sure you don't forget anything. There's a bag of basketballs in the equipment room. Yeah. Go and get them! What? Sorry, are you trying to ask me a question, Len? Really? Would you mind going to grab the balls and bringing them out here? Sure. Len! Len! Oh, my God. ...He hands me this soggy napkin. He'd sworn out the complaint, right there and then. I mean, he happened to be, like, hammered in bar, but he was the best witness there. Pizza Margherita con cipolla. That looks very good. Thank you. I could totally take a vacation, by the way. I mean, I would, for, like, three days? Four! Four days, for real. Okay, hold on a second. You think that you could leave the Cookie Jar in Lisa's hands for four entire days? What about you? You think you could take a vacation and leave Bill and eight deputies in charge of Eden Lake's safety for four days? You think I can't? Mm-hmm. If we make a deal, we make a promise... I stick to it. Wait, are we being serious now? I'm being serious, and besides, it might be the only way that we actually get two date nights, like, back-to-back, is if we actually leave town, and we get out of here. Maybe it would. Oh, Norman's calling. What is he, uh, checking up on us? No, he is not. Norman, what's going-- Okay, Norman, I need you to relax. Just take it easy. Norman, take it easy. Okay, look, I will call it in. You stay right there, and don't touch a single thing, okay? It's gonna be all right, Norman. What? Coach Bishop is dead. Norman just found the body. Come on, we gotta go. Okay. Get your crutch. Careful. No, I got it. Uh, we'll leave your car here, we'll take mine, okay? Wait, what? Unless you want to go home. No! Well, if I told you to go home, you would have followed me anyway, right? Well, right. Hey, uh, Johnson! Can we borrow you for a second? Can you make sure you dust everything in this truck, even the back there? - Norman, you okay? - Yeah. Okay, thank you for calling. I'll catch up with you in one minute, okay? Hey, Schmidty! Can you try and get all the security-camera footage from all over the school, please? Thank you. Bill... - Hey. - What do we got? Hit and run. Hey, Norman, you okay? Yeah. ...Dents on the fender here... Did you have a practice here tonight? We have an away game tomorrow. Did you get shots of all this? No, not yet. Antoine, I want pictures of all of this, please. We'll wait for the M.E., obviously. Let me show you something else here. This is the school's equipment truck. Yup. The key's still in it. So someone borrowed a vehicle for a hit and run? Well, it's one way to keep evidence off your own car, right? Yeah, I guess it is. All right, I'm going to go get Norman's statement? All right. ...When I was talking to him, I mean, he was looking back over my shoulder... Like someone was coming out of the gym? But you didn't see who it was? No, no, I don't want to make a big thing about it. It was just a look, it might have been nothing. I-I don't know. I-I'm... then I went inside... So, where was the truck parked when you went inside? The truck was here, right here. Okay, just hold off one sec here, guys. Let's get this whole area right here roped off! All of this, please! What makes a mark like that? There. Is that, like, a cleat? No, I don't think so. Kind of looks like... kind of looks like high heels, doesn't it? Can I ask you about these uniforms here? Michelle... Who? Coach Bishop's wife, her name is Michelle, she was wearing stiletto heels tonight, and I saw her having a fight with her husband. Mrs. Bishop? I'm Mike Kingston. I'm a detective with the sheriff's department. I'm very sorry for your loss. Is there someone that we can call for you? No. We'll have to ask you a few questions. When was the last time that you saw your husband? At the school. Everyone saw him. At the contest? And where did you two go after that? Len had to work. He stayed, I came home. And so that was the last time that you saw him, or you heard from him? Were you two on good terms? We heard that there was an argument between you earlier today? That was nothing. I tried to get Len to take a day off work. All he does is work. Look, here's the truth. He wouldn't even take a dinner break with me. Okay, well, I'm going to have to get a formal statement from you tomorrow. In the meantime, here's my card. Please give a call if you think of anything that might be of help, okay? Mrs. Bishop, are these the shoes that you had on earlier? Uh-huh. I'm going to have to take these in for testing. Take whatever you want. So, do you believe her? No... I don't. The police have ruled Leonard Bishop's death a homicide. We mourn his passing and send our condolences to his family. For now, Norman Rhodes will step in as temporary coach for the Rebels. It could have been me! Last night? No, no. At the rehearsal. Oh, oh... It has been reported... It should be warm in here. ...Discovered the body last night in the back of the school near the gymnasium. At least Hannah didn't find the body this time. But she was still at the scene of the crime. I saw it on TV. I'd think twice if I were Mike Kingston. For his own safety. I mean, Hannah is a murder magnet. Can we keep the door closed, please? It's freezing. Good morning, ladies. Mrs. Bascomb, Mrs. Houser. These are our valued customers, they have a short Americano, and a black tea, decaf... ...Michelle is a suspect whether I like it or not, so I'm gonna-- Tom, hey! Will you hand me that tray? Yup, thank you so much. We gotta keep moving here. All right-- Oh, there you are, Lisa. Okay, the molasses crackles are in the oven. What next? Uh, we need three dozen Chocolate Highlander Bars for the Eden Lake Inn. They want them for afternoon tea. - Today? - Yes. I'm on it. Okay. Hannah, I have an airtight alibi for last night. He was definitely hit by the pickup. We had severe head trauma, body bruising, broken femur, broken ribs. Read the report. Hmm, yeah. What's bothering you? Just... one of my hunches. Will you run the tests again, and re-examine the body, please? I'll take another look. Thank you. Peterson! You find the coach's phone? Still M.I.A. We're going back over the scene again right now. Okay, great. Hey, Mike... let me show you something. What do we got? Hallway by the gym, coach's office, equipment storage, south exit, and main parking lot. Nothing at the back of the school? No. There's this camera that angles the north end of the track, but nothing by the gym. Okay, so, 20:50. Now, how long does it take to walk from the back of the gym to the weight room? Ah, it's not far. A few minutes, if that. Hmm. 21:10, that's our timeline. Plus, what, 7-8 minutes for Norman to walk each way? Which leaves approximately 20 minutes for the murder. That's enough. Well, if someone was already at the school. Yeah. And look who was. Now, what camera is that? That's the coach's office. That hallway, it's on the other side of the gym, so there's no way that Norman would've seen her. And check the time. That is 20:45, which is plenty of time to get to the field. Yeah. I think it might be time to pull the plug on the bake-off. End the contest? No, we can't. My station has too much at stake. We have invested too much in resources to make this work. We need the revenue from the finals to break even, let alone turn a profit. This isn't a little bump in the road. One of our judges is dead. Well, then, the next judge on the list, I'm sure they'll be happy to step in. You have a list of potential judges? I'm a producer, I'm ready for everything. I had to make sure there was an alternate available. Oh. Well, I guess that makes sense. Why was Coach Bishop on the show last night if he's last on the list? I bumped him up. I thought it'd be good publicity for the team, and since we were using the school, it was a good tie-in. Okay... Hannah? What are you thinking? Well, I had that weird accident, and then Mr. Rutledge got so sick he had to drop out, and now Coach Bishop. It's... It's just not a good list to be on, is it? What, you think these things are connected? No... I don't know. Okay, well, then, I think we need to keep going. So, I've got a fantastic mystery challenge. It's really going to force the contestants into conflict... Okay, boys, let's bring it in for a sec. Come on in, bring it in. I just want to take a minute to tell you guys how proud I am of you, in each and every one of you guys for making the decision to play this week. Yeah, that's it. Good job. Lay-ups, okay? How are they doing? Uh, all right. Still in shock, I think. Sure. What are you doing here? Are you investigating? I kind of want to check out the Coach's office. The cops already went through it. I'm sure they did. Okay. Uh, hey guys! Let's do weight room! Come on, hustle up, let's run there. Ten minutes, okay? We never had this conversation. I don't even know what you're talking about. You like the wife for this? Well, I mean, they were fighting, she was at the scene, at the right time, and she lied about it. And if these are her shoe prints? Yeah. There were other prints there besides Norman's, right? Yeah. Yeah, they look like sneakers. Well, I mean, it was a track field. No, no, just by the truck. Preliminary says size 12. I'm gonna get shoe sizes on all the players. You think a kid did this? Look, I don't want to, but 10 minutes before Norman gets to the equipment room... Josh Reynolds. Second-string guard. Angry guy. Yeah, well... Carl Kimball was the star of the team. Josh didn't get much playing time? No, Coach Bishop lived to win. Right in, right in, right in! We got it! Okay, here, ball, ball. Fast break-throw, right? So, right through, don't stop. Fast, right? And if he gets beat, you come in and help him out, right? Don't leave him there. Okay, uh, three-on-three. Hey, Norman. Mike. How are you? Good, good. The guys are looking pretty good. Yeah-- There it is! Atta boy, Reynolds! That's the back-up guard, right? Yeah, Josh Reynolds. He's great. I heard the starter is really something. Carl Kimball, he's the Eden Lake all-star. And Josh isn't as good? Yeah, Josh is good, he's, uh... didn't have the advantages. Kimball's had private training all summer, special diet since he was a kid. Sounds like serious business. Yeah, well, the Big Ten schools are all looking at him, scouting. Doesn't give a kid like Reynolds much of a shot, though, does it? Nope. Norman, did you see Josh the night of the murder? No, why? 'Cause he was here. Security-camera footage showed him leaving the equipment room about 15 minutes before you got there. He smashed a display case on his way out. Josh is a really good kid, Mike. I'm gonna need a few minutes with him. Now? Today? - Yeah. - No. He's a minor, he's not even 18 yet. You can't question him without his family there, you know that. He was here, he could have seen something, he could be a witness. Well, it doesn't sound like that's where you're going with this, Mike. Look, Norman, I'm just trying to clear the guy. No, I understand that. Just do it with a parent there, okay? Just call his mother, Mike. Okay, wait, so you tossed Coach Bishop's office? I didn't toss it. What were you thinking? Well, sort of. Oh, my gosh. Okay... So cute when you're sleeping. Um, get over here and elevate your leg, lady. I am! I have been. Sort of. Anyway, thank you for coming all this way. I know it's sort of a pain. Who's a little baby-- Stop it! This is what it's like being a big sister. I kind of like it, except for the whole part where you're hurt. Yeah. Okay, continue your story. You were tossing an office? Right, so Michelle thought that her husband was having an affair, and they fought about it the night of the contest. So, do you think that's true? Here's what I know, Hypothetically, if you found out that Bill was stashing some fancy suit at the station, and you found a receipt for an expensive dinner and a hotel keycard in the pocket, what would you think? That I'm about to throw the rest of his stuff out the window. Right, it sounds like an affair. But, see, that's not Bill. I mean, I wouldn't believe it. I would need to see proof. And how would you get proof? Hi, this is Michelle Bishop calling... Hi, my name is Michelle Bishop, I'm calling for Mr. Walters... Oh, uh, okay, I'm sorry-- --I must have the wrong number. I'm gonna try Griffin next. Oh, that was a bust. Next guy on the list is... Gordon Glossop, "Internationally Renowned, Gordon Glossop." It says they're very discreet. He must use aliases-- Oh, hello. Hi-- Yes, hi, this is Michelle Bishop calling. I'd like to find out more about the report I asked you to do on my husband Len? Yeah, I haven't received my report on my husband, Len. I should have got it ages ago-- No, I'll wait. Oh, uh... I... didn't get it. Uh... could I get you to-- --send it to you! --To resend it to me? P.O. Box! Maybe send it to my P.O. box? What? No, I don't know who could've signed for it, but... Hello? Okay. Michelle signed for it at her house. No, no, this is amazing. She figured it out, and then she hung up, but she did say that she sent certified mail to Michelle Bishop. This is all we need to know right now, that Michelle Bishop hired a P.I., we know which one. I am gonna text Mike. Josh, we have footage of you at the school the night of the murder. I did extra weights. Drills. Well, this right here... does not look like a drill to me. I-- Josh... I will pay for the damage. Where did you go after that? - Home. - Straight home? Yeah. And what time was that at? I don't remember. It was like 8:00, 8:30? 8:45-- Josh was home by 9:00. You were there? I thought you had questions for Josh about what happened that night. What size sneaker do you wear? Don't answer that. Are you charging my son with a crime? No, I am not. Then we're leaving. If you have any more questions, we'll be back with a lawyer. Mrs. Reynolds-- Mrs. Reynolds, Look, I am trying to rule Josh out, not in. Do you know what my son's been doing on weekends? No, Mom, Mom, Mom-- No, it's better that he knows. He drives to Marshall for a job. In Marshall? They're not allowed to work during the season. It was Coach's rule. May he go? Yes. I'll see you after practice, sweetheart. He's a good kid, detective, turned himself inside out for Coach Bishop, loved the guy, still won't hear a bad word about him. Have you? Heard a bad word? When I found out about Josh's job last week, I wanted to throttle the coach myself. You know, Josh doesn't need the money to help me out. He wanted to keep up with the other kids, buy Coach a big present. I mean, what kind of teacher expects expensive presents? The kid's not half as angry as the mom. Do I need to check her alibi as well? Yeah, definitely. I wasn't sure what you'd be in the mood for, so I brought you a variety. Thanks for coming by. Not many people do, but that's not a surprise. Listen, Michelle, I know it's been rough. I thought this was a friendly visit. Michelle, I am your friend. - Really? - I am-- Hello. Hello. Hannah asked me to meet her here. Michelle, we need to talk about the fight that you had with Len. I already told you. I know that you thought Len was having an affair. Look, we know you hired a private investigator, a Mr. Glossop. Okay. Yes, I did! Do you want to know what he found? That was what he found. Clearly not a woman. Business as usual. But you said "There was someone else." This is what I meant. Did you see your husband after the contest? No, he stayed to work. You didn't go to his office? I looked for him, but he wasn't there. He was working, that is what he wanted, so I came home. Okay, is there anyone that can confirm what time you got home? Nobody else lives here. I did stop for gas. Did you get a receipt? No, I didn't get one. Actually there is one more thing, we couldn't find your husband's phone on him or in the van. He lost it the day before the contest. He hadn't gotten a new one yet. Am I under arrest? No, you're not, but I will need you to come to the station to amend your statement. I'll need a minute. What about this guy, you recognize him? No. It's sort of hard to see. I'll get you copies right away. You're the reason we have them, and I really don't want to arrest you for stealing evidence. Thanks. So, what's your take? I think she's lying, but I don't think that makes her a killer. She's our top suspect. Did you check out the contestants of the Bake-off? Have you? Yes. I mean, three contest judges have something weird happen all within a few days? I think that's weird, right? I have this freak accident, I almost get knocked out, Charles Rutledge gets a mysterious illness, he's out, and then the Coach ends up dead? Okay... but why? If you rig the contest to win, you get $25,000 and a pretty high-profile cover story, that's motive. So, what did your repair guy say about the stairs? He said that it's a miracle those stairs didn't break on me a long time ago. I know. And there's a flu going around. Rutledge probably caught the flu. I say whoever came after the coach was after the coach-- - I'm just-- ---Not the contest. Okay. Here we go. After you. Hey, Mike... the report on the truck, and the footprint casts. What'd we get? Those spike marks? A perfect match for Michelle Bishop's heels. Depth of the print consistent with her height and weight. She said she went looking for Bishop that night. Yeah, well, maybe she found him. She also sent a P.I. to follow Bishop in Minneapolis. This is what they found, check this out. A business dinner? No I.D. on that guy. I'll take a crack at it. Peterson, did the subpoenas come through on Bishop's bank statements? Yeah, should be in your inbox. Nice. You think there's a financial angle on this? I think we need to find out a whole lot more about Leonard Bishop. Mike! You need to see this. We love your hunches. I went back and looked again. They're faint, that's why I missed them at first. Petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes. Whoa. How? We found microscopic plastic fibers on the body and the face. So... he was smothered with this? No. It was wrapped around the bundle of jerseys in the truck. What is this? The... the laundry wrap? Mm-hmm. Was he moved? No, it all happened in one spot. He took a direct hit from the pickup, but I believe he was still conscious. The suffocation is what caused the cardiac arrest. So, the driver gets out of the car, and actually makes sure he's dead. This was deliberate. Look, just consider it, Clayton. If the donation came from Hartland in honor of Coach Bishop, and it was designated to finding a new coach-- No, no, no, no, the school should decide how the money is spent. Right, I-- We have equipment that will zoom in further, if you want. No, thanks. That's Coach Bishop. Yeah. Look, Hannah, everyone knows you are a better investigator than half that sheriff's department. I would be more than happy to help out. Well, thank you, but it's nothing. Okay. Do you want to go over the running order for the finals? Sure. Perfect. Great. Um, you know what, I think I left it in the booth. Oh, Nathan, I forgot. I baked these for you and Carl. Oh, thanks, but, um, he hasn't had sugar since he was five. No offense, I'm sure they're delicious. None taken. I was just thinking about Carl, and how hard this must be for him, losing his coach. Well, he survived losing his mom, and he'll handle this. I'll make sure he's okay. We're a team. Excuse me. Did you get the school cafeteria B-roll? I was outside in the parking lot. Everyone arriving. Okay, make sure it's on the list, we need it. Hey, Mason, what's B-roll? Oh, it's footage that the crew gets that we use for bumpers in and out of commercials, cut-aways from the contest, that sort of thing. I'm gonna grab the list, okay? Okay. See what I mean. We got a little shadow. Chris, what kinds of things... ...make for good B-roll? Audience reactions, candid shots of the contestants and judges, like that. And you keep all that footage? Yeah, we gotta. How about some Cocoa Snaps? - Yeah! - Yes, please. Dig in. Brand-new, made 'em this morning. Wow... Wait, so you're saying the killer got out of the truck, saw that the coach wasn't dead, and... Who would do that? Yeah, this is next level... I just can't believe that someone who's capable of that is just walking around Eden Lake. Yeah, we don't know. Mike, you need to be careful. Did you just say that to me? 'Cause it sounded like you told me to be careful-- Yes, you know what, I did. Because I know I'm being careful. - Really? - And I'm just saying... Well, yeah, I can't go anywhere, on foot, anyway. Good, good. Who are you watching for? I'm looking for Michelle, first of all. I'm looking for the man in Michelle's photo. And Josh Reynolds, the basketball player-- One of the basketball players-- And his mom. Should I zoom in on that? Maybe I should get a little closer-- No please don't, no, no. That's not fair. Why-- That... is fantastic. That's a nice move. Now, hold on a minute, what was going on... ...On the sports field... In the basketball court... Calm down. That's Lowell Mantes, right? Yeah, but... it must've been after he was eliminated. He looks furious. You seem surprised? Well, I never thought he would behave that way. He always seemed so polite and neat, like he never spilled flour in his life. Well then, how can we trust the man? True. I want a copy of that. I need to talk to that man. Here we go. Amateur! I'm just gonna lean in a little bit more. You're not even looking-- Sorry, I'm kind of getting in the way here a little bit... Is... Is that the phone that Michelle said Bishop lost the day before? It is. Huh... I need a copy of that, too. Maybe the coach had two phones, or the killer just took his phone. But why would Michelle lie about it? Exactly. I mean, that's exactly why-- Mike? Wait, I... I don't have any... The brakes are out. The brakes-- I can't... I can't... I can't stop-- Mike, there's a car. Mike... Okay. Okay... Just brace yourself. Hold on. Mike! You okay. I'm okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm not feeling light-headed at all, actually. They were gone, they were completely and totally out. Forensics got under there. The brake lines were frayed. They were frayed, not cut? It's inconclusive. Plenty of wear and tear. What... What are you thinking? You're thinking this was deliberate? Well, I really am not one for coincidences. Hannah's not exactly the type to stay on top of her car maintenance schedule. I just don't think any of this is necessary. I mean, I really feel fine. Don't-- Don't listen to her. Please take her to the hospital, get her checked out. I'm fine. Take her in, please. Hey, listen, why don't you let the EMTs check you out. I'm fine, I've just got to clear my head. Look, I realize that I might be overreacting here. Do me a favor and look into this for me? I don't want to make it an official investigation if it really was just an accident, okay? Okay, I'll tell you what, I'll call Brummels, find out the last time that Hannah had the brakes checked. Great. Also make sure that Hannah gets to a hospital? For me? We might as well pick some up, right? Yeah, that makes sense. Cool, yeah, we'll just head over. ...Coach Bishop's wife, Michelle Bishop, out as a suspect? We are still investigating and there won't be any comment until there's an arrest. Mason! Hi! I wasn't expecting you today. I hope we don't have a meeting. Is something wrong? No, not at all. I just, I didn't see you making any deliveries yesterday, so I thought that you... you were, um... Yeah, I'm not exactly ready for deliveries yet. Are you here to buy something? Actually, I am. Really? Yeah, everyone loved the cookies you brought to set, so I was gonna grab some more. You seem to be moving around okay on your leg, right? Yeah, I do okay. Lisa will help you pick out whatever cookies you like. All right? Hey, Carl, what about you? You know, I did try a new experiment, it's orange berry delight, and it's sweetened only with all-natural fruit juice. Oh, that's okay, I just had breakfast. Your dad's really proud of you. We're a team. Whoa, you're not gonna eat any of this stuff, are you? I didn't touch anything. No? Well, your teammates will be very disappointed to hear that. Hey, Norman. Hey, how are you? Good. Come on, son. See you. - Bye. - See you, take care. It's nice to see you here. Hey, well, I hope you say that in a minute. I need four dozen cookies by 2:00. Norman! Come on... you can do it, can't you? You're lucky it's you. All right. Haven't been able to verify Ava Reynolds' alibi. And Lowell Mantes has disappeared. His landlady hasn't seen him since the night he was eliminated from the contest. Well, we need to get that out on the radio, okay? We gotta find this guy. Hey, what's this? Oh, I've been going through the last three years of Bishop's financials. Right, this is his joint checking account with his wife, and everything is pretty straightforward. He gets paid, he deposits it, he pays his bills, and there's a little bit left over, you see that? So a normal life. Right, right, except until... right there. He's over his credit limit, okay, but he settles it right here. No, but that's a different account number, and it's a different routing number than his regular bank. So, I was like, "What's up?" and I traced it. A small Minneapolis local bank. The account was opened with a $25,000 cashier's check. Sole signer, Leonard Bishop. 25K that didn't come out of any of his other accounts. No, exactly right, and look at that. $80,000. That is not your average high school teacher's banking practice. Mr. Rutledge, did any of the contestants approach you, try to contact you off camera? Oh, not a one. They knew the rules. Sure. Charles, it's time for your pills. Oh, for your flu? No, blood pressure and cholesterol. I'm not sure how much good they do, as sick as he's been. That's for sure. Are those pills sticky? Yes, isn't it ridiculous? Must be the humidity in the bathroom. They've been like this all week. Do you mind if I just... Sure. You don't by chance have any of the original pills left from the bottle, do you? Yes, of course. Why? I'm sure it's nothing. I just... Here. What? Is there a problem? These aren't the same. What's going on? Hey. You're not going to believe what I found, Mike. Someone's been tampering with Mr. Rutledge's medicine. The pill casings aren't the same as the originals in his bottle. I'll send Peterson over right away to pick it up, okay? Just stay put. Okay, great. I'll be here. The prescriptions come right from my doctor... How long do you think it'll take the lab to get results on these? They'll put a rush on it, but I can't say. Oh. Would you gentlemen like some coffee? - Oh, I'd love some. - Cream and sugar? Yes, please. How about a muffin? Hey! Hey, nice rental. Just the person I was looking for. Oh, you didn't have to make a delivery. Well, I wanted to. Besides, I need a favor, too. What's up? Well, I need someone who is discreet, has access to a lab, and happens to have a working knowledge of chemistry. Who's your wingman? Oh, honey, you sound so wonderful. Oh, your left side is definitely your best side, so if you could just angle... - Hannah? - Hmm? What is all that paperwork? Oh, the applications and background checks on all the contestants. Look, can we focus, please? - What? - Here. What is all this? Wardrobe options from Claire's. The station provides all the wardrobe. Don't hold your breath. Dee buys all her own clothes for a reason-- It's Norman! Hey. Great. Okay. Sounds good. I'm so glad you two are still keeping in touch. He's such a wonderful man. Yes, he is. His mother says that he's dating. Quite a bit. Yes, I have heard that. So, uh, I have to run, Mother. Or... hobble. Oh! Check your texts! Although this one would look good on me... Emetine? Emetine, yeah, and cephaeline and another alkaloid, probably psychotrine. Can you just give me the Twitter version? Yeah, they're all alkaloids that are found in Ipecac rhizomes, and Ipecac induces vomiting. Oh, okay, so where do you get that? Well, you can't. It hasn't been in production for years now. Someone would have to know how to make it. And then they would have to know how to inject it into a capsule, and then rebond the surface so that it only has one tiny little sticky spot? Yeah. I mean, these people may know how to make maple syrup, but it's a little more complex. I've been going over their backgrounds and their applications. They all are who they say they are. Hmm. So, what about the judges? I mean, to fix this thing, they'd have to work it from both ends, right? Start it-- Right. Backwards. - Right? - That's right. 'Cause if you don't have the judge in on it, then what would even be the point? But Mason didn't go in order of this list. He skipped to the end when he picked Coach Bishop. So, even if you had this list, you wouldn't know which judge is next. But who would have been next on the list after Mr. Rutledge. Gino Paliatti. I can't explain it better, it's just that his-- - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. --His texts are short, and he only talks about work, and... We literally haven't even been alone together since several nights ago, I think he's backing off. Yeah, okay, or he's a guy, and he has absolutely no clue how it comes across. Just ask him out. What? It's the 21st Century. You've been dating, it's not gonna be a big surprise. Just ask him out. I guess so. Mike? Hey. Um, I got the lab to put a rush on analyzing those capsules, And we're looking for Lowell Mantes, who's... he has not been home since after the contest. Okay. Well, thanks for checking. Oh, and... the gas station by the by-pass has got security footage that puts Michelle there at the time of the murder. Hey, so, I have a new theory on the case, and I... was wondering if you wanted to go with me to interview this chef, and then we could grab a bite after? I'm sorry, I got a-- I got a meeting set up, and I just have to stay focused right now. Okay. Mike... Don't forget your cookies. Thank you. Get the risotto out now. If it sits there for two minutes, it's ruined! Let's go! You gotta go slow, slow, slow, and then it's ready, boom. That's why you have the best risotto in town. Grazie, Bella. Okay, so these chefs... Here you go. Enjoy the pizza. Do you think I'm in danger? Well, I just want to be careful, you know? Listen, Gino, wait. Um, do you have any connection to any of them? I need a bottle of Pinot Noir for table number four. Uh, Mrs. Houser comes in a couple times a month. She wants cheese on a Shrimp Scampi. Brutta figura. I never say a word. I don't know this Jeff kid... This is my favorite Pinot Noir. Enjoy the wine. And Lowell used to work for me a few years ago, but I haven't seen him since. Wait, Lowell used to work here? He didn't put that on his resume. It's probably too traditional for him to claim. How are you? I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. Mario at the end of the bar, he will help you. Wait, what do you mean, "traditional"? He was into that molecular gastronomy craze. "A food revolution." Well, I can see why that didn't fit in here. How are you gonna keep a place open with that nonsense, huh? What am I gonna do with liquid nitrogen? Who wants to eat freeze-dried pasta? We're not astronauts? I told him he was talented, but if he could just be happy cooking food a person wanted to eat, he should give me a call. I like the guy, but he's a little bit crazy. There you go, enjoy. Gino, do you think that Lowell knew some chemistry? He had more chemical formulas than he had recipes. So go be a scientist then. Cooking is an art, huh? You know this. I do. Grazie. Ciao, Bella. Norman. Listen, if you get this message, please meet me at 68 Swall Street as soon as possible, and you might need to wear sloppy clothes. Okay? Oh, I'm sorry. Mike! Hey. Nice seeing you. My parents say hello. Oh, nice. Yeah, I owe them a call, actually. I just... I sometimes wonder if it makes it worse for them to hear from me. Sometimes, I wonder if we're the only ones who understand. I mean, we all lost Lydia. I sort of thought I was better. You are. I can see it. It's not gone, it's just kind of settled, you know? The grief has... I don't know, it's kind of found its place. Well, it's been three years, so... Hmm. What's wrong? Lydia, um... she just... she just ran out to the store to pick up something that she forgot at the market, you know? She left her glass right there on the counter, her club soda. She was coming right back. And, uh... I mean, I could, uh, I could still smell her perfume in the room when the phone rang. It was just minutes. That's how it happens, and you're joking, and you're laughing, and everything is great, and then out of nowhere... they're gone. Are we still taking about Lydia? If you've found someone, we'll be happy for you. My sister would be happy for you. I know that. Tell me. Well, um... She's, um... I mean, she's amazing. She's funny, and she's smart, and she's strong, and she's beautiful, and she's stubborn. She won't let anything go, and I thought that if I keep her close, I keep her safe, but I-I can't. I can't, even if I'm right there with her. I can't watch her every minute of every day, and... honestly, I don't know if I can take the chance. Better question-- What would you look like if you never took the chance again? What would your life look like then? This is Lowell Mantes' recorded voice, which means you sadly have missed Lowell. Norman! Come on! His voicemail keeps picking up. Yeah, I mean, supposedly, Lowell hasn't been seen in a couple days, since he got eliminated, so-- You were checking Apartment Six, right? Yeah, no answer. Yeah, okay. Let's do it. Okay, so, we'll look for, you know, mail, or something that might have an address on it? Okay. Or we could look for dough. What, money? No, like, cookie dough, pie crust dough... Right. Sometimes, doughs are so dense, you don't want to put them down the disposal. Okay. Norman, you are the best. Thank you. Why are you here? Well, you're never dull. And I figure, you know, if Mike messes up, I'll position myself nicely. Please, I have seen the women buzzing around you lately. Well, there you go. Don't, uh, take too long, or-- Oh, hold on. Ew! Ew! This looks like dough, right? Oh, yeah, yeah! What's in that one? A spinach cookie? You do get points for creativity. What else has he got in here, though? Do you think maybe he cooked it up? He... What's that? Norman, do you think that's it? Let me get a picture of it. Oh... Cephaelis ipecacuanha. That's the plant source for Ipecac. I lost a contest and took a trip. I went camping. Since when is that a crime? What is this about? You're gonna want to save all this for your lawyer. Have a seat, I'll be back in a minute. Is this about the contest? Because I can explain-- Lowell Mantes surfaced at a rest stop on Highway 18. I think you're gonna want to get this checked out. I bet it proves that he tampered with my basement stairs. I needed the money, the exposure. I needed Gino Paliatti on that judges' panel. He was next on the judge's list, and he would've taken care of me. I just needed one judge to drop out, and I was a lock for the win. You went after Hannah Swenson. You scored her basement stairs. Maybe I do need a lawyer. And when that didn't work, you made Rutledge sick with this emetic stuff, but the problem was, is they put Coach Bishop in there instead, and he eliminated you, so you went after him-- What are you talking about? You... You think I killed Bishop? Look, I'm not crazy, and I'm definitely not a murderer. Well, what did you think would happen when you cut the brakes on Hannah's car? Hannah's car? What... I don't know what you're talking about. You said you wanted a lawyer? Make the call. No... No, I'm serious, I don't know anything about cars. I know chemistry, and I knew the amount wasn't fatal! What do you think? I think the guy is definitely out there. I think he hurt Hannah, and he poisoned Rutledge. But...? But he seemed genuinely surprised when I brought up Bishop. Yeah. Which means the killer might still be out there. I might have an alibi for Lowell. Well, we need to verify it. Now, where are we with Ava and Josh? They're coming in again today, with a lawyer. Check this out. I got an I.D. on our mystery man. Peter Roscoe. Big-time sports agent, known for spotting young talent. He reps coaches, too. So Bishop was looking for an agent? No, he wouldn't get a guy like this, not with his resume. But if this Roscoe was going after a player at Eden Lake High, then he would wine and dine the coach to get at the player, right? Agents, they lock these kids down so early. Wait, what about money at this stage in the game? I mean, any money changing hands? Well, not legally. If Roscoe greased any palms, and they got caught, the coach would lose his job. Now, if the player saw any of the money, he'd get banned from NCAA ball. Okay, I'm going through the coach's computer again. We need Bishop's phone. It's in the landfill. We've got to go through it all again and hope that something jumps out at us. Come on, guys. All right. You know, this is how departments should be run. You sure you want to be Sheriff full time? Hi. Hey. We got Lowell on the poisoning, and he pretty much confessed to messing with your basement stair. Wow. I know. I don't know about him for the murder, though. He's got an alibi, and we're checking it out, but I... I just, I'd really love to see you tonight. I-I-- There's a lot-- I have the contest finals in a little bit-- Hello, honey! I've narrowed it down to four dresses, which you must try on right now, Hannah-- My mother just got here. As you can hear. I'll talk to you later. Fashion is my thing. Mother, uh, listen to me, I thought we agreed to meet at the event, you know, and we would go... Are you text-flirting with the stage manager at-- Ahem! Excuse me. Yes, your mother dates, Hannah. Aw! So sweet. What? Hannah, I know that look, you are having an "Ah-hah" moment, aren't you? Mother, I have to go. There's something I have to do. - But the-- - And you are the best. - Thank you. - Hannah! I love you. I'll see you later. Fashion can't be rushed, Hannah. Please don't lie to me, you went to Len's office to get his phone. He lost it days before he was killed. I saw footage of him holding his phone the night he was killed. Okay. I found it in his office that night, before he was killed. Hannah, I wanted to turn it in, honest. At first, I was afraid the detectives would think that I killed him, and then I was afraid that they'd wonder why I kept it. Did you find what you were looking for? "K.F." The Minneapolis number. Kaitlin Farley, Len's girlfriend. You called her? She was wondering why she hadn't heard from him for a few days. Michelle, I'm so sorry. So I hired a sleazy P.I. Anyway, I just, I didn't want the whole world to find out about it. I didn't want to give people another reason to stare. Hey, who is, um, "Boomer56"? What does it say? It says, "Great game. "Defense in second half was genius." Sounds like a fan. The alumni and the parents were always sucking up to him. Okay, but earlier, it talks about a wire transfer? "A.S.A.P." "Need one more day." I don't know, maybe a banker who's a fan? So, once she was cleared as a suspect, she just didn't realize it was important. Now it really could be. You should check out the text from Boomer56. It talks about wire transfers and needing more time. That's it, that's exactly what we've been looking for. I mean, that could be the break in the case. I hope so. Look, Hannah, I'm just really happy that you wanted to see me, 'cause I... There's so much-- I really only have a few minutes, and, um, I have to go back in, so-- Okay, I just, I just wanna... I just feel like I owe you an explanation for... you know, how things have been. I... I care about you so much, and-and... and you're just such an amazing woman. But... - It's okay. - No-- No, I get it, and you don't owe me an explanation, Mike. - You really don't, so I-- - No, no, no, no. You don't get it, you definitely don't, because I am crazy about you, Hannah, and it... It, like, drove me nuts the other day, when you could've died in that accident, and I couldn't do anything to stop it, and it really freaked me out, and I'm sorry that I got all weird on you, and I don't-I don't want that. What do you want? Hannah! We need you. I want-I want us. I want you and me-- We need you! --You and me... And this is not at all the way I sort of pictured this happening, but I saw that look on your face the other day, and I couldn't stand it. It looked like you were gone, and out, and I would understand, I guess, if you were, but I don't want to lose you because I didn't speak up, so I'm speaking up, and I'm telling you that I want us, I want us to have a real chance. Hannah, we're at places. Well, just-- Say something. - Sorry-- - Mike-- They need you now. Hannah... What? Um, I have to... I have to go. Um... Copy that. Oh, uh, the audience is already loaded in, so you'll have to go around to the back. Oh, okay. I didn't even know this was a way in-- There you are! We're not gonna have time to get you tszujed now. We're walking right now. - Sorry. - Is Mike coming? No, he had to work. He's probably making up for last night. His sister-in-law was down from Minneapolis, so Bill had to cover him-- You're on now! Yeah. You look great, I will see you in there. 25 seconds. Copy that. 20 seconds! Hurry! Uh... coming. We are traveling. I got her. We're in. 15 seconds. Hannah, hurry up. What are you doing? And we're going to air. Hustle to places, everyone. Okay, okay. Let me fix your collar. - She's fine. - Stand up. Posture. We're at 10 seconds, everyone. Energy, too. Okay, honey? You look so pretty. I'm so proud of you. Okay, Dee, throwing to Hannah in five, four... Smile! Three, two... And now Hannah Swenson will introduce tonight's challenge. Forensics traced the IP on "Boomer56." It's Mason Kimball. Wait, wait, wait, what? No, no, no, that makes perfect sense. His son's the star of the team. Well, he's heavily scouted, sure, but these texts make it look like Mason's paying off the coach. Or trying to, and Bishop's putting the squeeze on him. Yeah, Norman told me that Mason's son's got expensive training, he's got special food, the whole deal. Right, so maybe Mason's getting the payoffs, using the money on his kid, the coach finds out... he wants a cut, right? Yeah, Ava Reynolds said-- Remember Ava Reynolds said that Coach Bishop had very, very expensive taste. He was very greedy. Right, so Bishop puts the squeeze on Mason. Yeah, but how? If Carl got turned in to the NCAA, he'd be banned. And if Mason doesn't pay up, well, then all the work that he's done for his son's career is completely meaningless. That's a hell of a motive. We need to get Mason Kimball in here right now. Good work. Busted. Is that your detective boyfriend? No. Just texting with my mother. Okay, we're checking in with our chefs in 10 seconds. Mr. Kimball? Hannah, you ready? Yeah. In five, four, three, two... It's time to check in with our chefs, but, um... I think we should turn the cameras on Mason Kimball. Everybody, this is the station manager of WKNW... He's right there, yeah. There he is. It's actually thanks to him that we even have a show, so everybody give him a round of applause. WKNW's-- Hannah! Mason? Mother, I have to-- Wait, Hannah... Hannah! Uh, let's check in with our chefs. Jeff, how is it going over here? Well, my soufflé is set, but my ganache is giving me a fit, so... I can get everything done as long as nothing is wrong. Mrs. Houser, how's it going? - No drama. - Pardon me? I'm about to take my soufflé out of the oven. Step back! Message from Hannah. Boomer56 is Mason. Mason, stop! Stay away from me! Carl... Get back! Carl! - Hannah! - Hannah! Hannah Joanne! Hey, what's going on? Where's Hannah? Uh, we don't know. She introduced Mason Kimball, and then they both just took off, and we're right in the middle of taping the show! Hannah! Norman, I need you to get everybody-- Everybody's got to get back inside the studio, okay? All of you, all of you, back inside the studio. Officer's on the way. Get inside there, stay there-- The show must go on! Stay there. Back into the studio, please. Mason... Get away from me! Mike, stop! Stop. He's not trying to kill us. What? Look where he shot. Mason! You are completely surrounded, there's no way out! There's one way. Where does that lead? Back stairs. You shouldn't be here! Mason, I saw you, with Carl, when you brought him into the Cookie Jar. It was the day after my brakes failed. Hi. I wasn't expecting you today I hope we don't have a meeting... I offered him a cookie that was just sweetened with fruit juice, and he... turned me down. I asked him if it was too much, all the diets, and the training, and Carl got the biggest smile on his face. He said it was all worth it. "My Dad and I are team." That's what he said. He's an incredible athlete. Mason, you've done an amazing job, you know. You should be so proud of him-- No. No, he's a natural. You did it! Carl, you were amazing! Dad, I told you we were going to win. I am so proud of you, son-- You nurtured him, you helped him. The money was for Carl. It's for his training. I'd already mortgaged everything I had to pay for it, and borrowed, and... And then there was some trouble, but you... you found a way to pay them back. No! Okay-- - Don't move! - Okay. I was in the clear. And I had it all worked out. Then Bishop shows up with his hand out. I just met with Peter Roscoe. I can explain-- Oh, I think it's been explained. What do you want? I had no choice. Why don't you tell me what happened that night, the night Coach Bishop died? Five minutes. He gave me five minutes to save my son's future. How was I supposed to stop him from making that phone call I begged him for a little more time. Look, all I'm asking for is a little more time, man-- There is no more time, tomorrow in my account, or I pick up that phone, and this is over-- What about my kid, man? What about Carl? That's on you, Mason. No, listen-- Don't you touch me! He wouldn't listen. He didn't care about Carl. He only cared about the money. I couldn't let him rob my boy of his brilliant future. He said he was going to turn Carl in to the NCAA on Monday unless he got another 30 grand. Carl didn't know, did he? He doesn't know. How do you destroy a great kid for something he had no part of? Bishop didn't care. He started to walk away. But I couldn't let him. I'm so sorry. I'm not... this man. I've done some terrible things. Terrible things... I didn't know what else to do. I'd do anything for Carl. I want you to... tell Carl that I'm very proud of him. Mason... He's the best son... Mason. ...a father could have. Mason, don't do that. Mason, stop! Let me die. Dad! What's going on? What are they doing? Where are they doing? Stay away, son. Stay as far away from this as you can. No, this is wrong. Get me out of here. No... Dad! Step back, step back. What... what is he doing? Where are they taking him? It's going to be okay. We don't like to think about how much your whole life can turn upside down in just one minute. All right. Come on, son. But sometimes, that's a minute to dare. Mike, I know, it was a stupid thing to do, but once I realized that he had a gun, I was super careful, and I wasn't running after him-- You can't run. Well, right, and I wouldn't have anyway. Probably. But I was trying to make sure I could keep an eye on him-- Hannah. Hannah-- --Until you got there-- Hannah, I get it. When did I have you? At the part where I was super careful? The day I met you. And I wouldn't change a single thing about you, not one. So, what do you say? Yes. Yes to us? Yes to a chance? It's always a chance, isn't it? I'll take it. Me too. When you get the chance, take it. Take that leap of faith. You might love where you land. Almost ready. Big surprise, I made a special menu for the big party. You're the best. Thank you, Gino! Happy? Well, it's weird, isn't it? To have a party, and I'm not cooking? It's a little bit weird, but you can't cook for your own engagement party. Plus, didn't you make all those desserts I saw on the kitchen counter at home? Like, ten of them? Yes. Yeah. So...? Happy? Very. Really? Right now? Okay. Kingston. When? No, I need you to shut down the street. I need a bus and a CS team. On my way. You ready? - Let's do this. - Come on. You do realize that we're going to be late for our own engagement party, right? Oh, everybody knows us by now. And they're not going to go hungry-- I baked. And just like a great cookie recipe, true love delivers every time.
