You are at peace and the world is at peace with you. You are prepared... Rose! Come inside and help me get ready for the party! You are a hero. You can do anything. Rose! - Hey. - They're here! - Jessica's here! - We'll go tell your mom. Jessica's here! Oh, they're here? Well, maybe we should let them in. Go, go, go. Hello! Hi! We come with gifts. Thank you so much. Oh, in the kitchen. How are you? Come in. - Eric, get dressed hon. - What's up dude? You know, just doing it right. Pretty good. She doesn't talk to me. You know that. I have no clue what's going on with those two. - Eric! Door. - Hey! Congratulations! - Thank you. Thanks for coming. Before we eat I thought I'd say a few words. As you all know, Eric is heading off to college at the end of next week. He got into his dream school, UMW, which I thought I'd point out is my Alma mater. But what you might not know is also just like me, he'll be attending on a full ride. - All right, Eric. Going on a full academic and sports scholarship. Now I know you've all played a large part in Eric's life. That's why it's so special that you're here with us. I guess to wrap this up, keep up the hard work and don't let us down. No pressure. But really, your mom and I are proud of you and the man that you're becoming. I guess there's nothing else left to say except Go Lion. Thanks, dad. Oh, and if anyone wants to get a hold of me and Mary tonight, good luck. - Nate! - Dad. - 22 years ago today she got lucky. - Gross. It's been an amazing ride. I love you, babe. Love you, too. - Now, let's eat. - Rose? - I'll go get her. Rose! Hey Rose, where are you? Hey Rose. Hey. Hey. You all right? You remember when I carved that? A week before high school. Remember what I said to you? I said everything's gonna be okay. Wanna know why? - Why? - Cause I'm your big brother. And I'm never gonna let anything bad happen to you.

Rose, hold your hand still. Done. You just gotta let it dry while we read, okay? Okay. You ready? The girl who dreamed. Chapter 1 A shadow drifted over the land and colored it evil with its hand. A girl with a dream ran from her family in the hopes of one day making them proud. The sand shifted and the earth shook, but she was not afraid. 'I love life too much to worry about death' the girl with the dream said. Cities crumbled and forest turned to ash, but still she carried on. One thousand years went by but to her it was just a fleeting moment, a blink of an eye. She traveled through the fabric of time looking searching for her dream. People told her that she was foolish and to give up, but she refused. 'What was she looking for?' they asked. What could be so important? 'Love, ' she replied. You sleepy? Time for bed. - Can you keep it open? - Mm-hmm. Lights? - On. You got it. I want to be able to see my friend if he comes. - What? - My friend. - Who are you talking about? - He lives in the woods behind my house. He's nice. Eric thinks he is imaginary and I just made him up. But he's real. - You believe me, right? - Of course. Night, Rose See you tomorrow. Oh, really? I'm not kidding. I'll bake the bacon but I'm not gonna make the bread. - Oh really, rock paper scissors. We're back! - Eric! - They're probably still asleep. Eric! Rose! Rose! Eric! Where is Rose? Where's your sister? I don't know. Nate! Get up. - Rose! - Where is she? Rose? Where are you? - Mary, what are you doing? - I'm so sorry, Mrs. Waters. Jessica! Where's Jessica? Please. Where is your daughter? - Why are you hiding? Come out here. - Please, let's just go. Tell me. Where is my daughter? Where is Rose? You're the last one that saw her? Where is she? I don't know. - I was.. - Mom, mom. I know you're stressed, but don't take it out on Jessica. Okay, you know her. What are you doing? Come on, let's go home. That's okay. Let's go home. I don't know where she is. I'm so sorry. I don't know where she is. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. It's okay. I knew I shouldn't have left the two of you last night. Hey, hey, it's not your fault. It's fine. Answer it. Hello. Thank you. What did they say? They found her. Where? I'm sorry, I will never leave again. Eric! I see you. Okay, let's get ready for breakfast. You can rest up. Okay. Alright. Love you. Thanks. Eric! Rose! Breakfast! Hey, how are you feeling? You, okay? All right. - Thanks. - Of course. Guess what mommy made? Your favorite. Hot off the grill. Bacon and eggs.
