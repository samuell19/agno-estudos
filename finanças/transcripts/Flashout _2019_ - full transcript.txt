Air is low on fresh additives today. Of course, it's long ceased to matter. The universe is stupid. But the multiverse? No, not the infinitely inter-connected universe of all universes. All knowing. Sentient. This was my boss. It gave me, gave those like me small jobs, minor adjustments. That's how it all began for me.

Subscribe now to our blind date alternate world game. Visit real worlds, not virtual. Experience actual baby universes for two, three, or four players. Step into cosmically astonishing new realities with our exclusive white hole science breakthrough, Intermate. Ready now through all microtainment outlets within the habitat. I had been assigned to this universe, assigned to shut down InterMate, to freeze it as is. Use a simple quantum block, a small half measure. To merely suspend their upstart mini realities? That's all? It was another weak work order. I had more than I could remember, mundane, repetitive. Meanwhile, here, they were actually decoding the hidden forces of space-time itself. This time I had to break the rules. I would improvise. Use my own advance strategies, my ideas for protecting the multiverse. I would stop these hackers from unraveling the actual fabric of reality. Stop them totally and for good. Dess Yes, Taloor? Good news, I booked you for that holocast dream song. Just a moment. Now is that the sound of an agent who sometimes works for me? Please, I got you InterMate, didn't I? Yeah, strange game. Why, what's strange? You play, you flashout, and you're home again. I wanna work on things I actually care about. Come on, Desa. You're the official spokesperson for InterMate. Tell me that's not a good thing. I'll give you that. But you also tried to book me for Vimalux. Seriously Taloor, Vimalux? A do-it-yourself gene splicer. Work is work, Desa. You were just getting started. InterMate is making you a celebrity now. Yes, it is. I'm still on for the Synesthesia project at eight? It's yours, holo confirmed. Auto schedule finalized. Smooches. Desa, time for a quick game of InterMate? These face paint technologies haven't advanced for a thousand years. I'm sorry Lleva, no. I have a holorecording at eight. I've got it all set, no prob'lies. We'll do one with Iastar. Who's she? You'll love her. She's over 200, so beautifully age-retarded. She's played just about every game. Look, Lleva, I'm just the spokesperson for InterMate. I just recite the words. I never play these eccentric group games. I don't need to. Get out of your hypocritical rut! I'm not hypocritical. I just like to keep things real. Channels S346. No, I have a holo at eight! The perfect extreme of ecstasy can be yours. Subscribe now to our blind date alternate world game. Visit real worlds, not virtual. Welcome in, Iastar. Love when you make me feel so inhabited. Say, I do have one prime message. Hi, I'm keeping our InterMate date. It's really like going some place else, isn't it? I know I'll see you there. We're hitting channels S346, a four player. Hello - Hello. Yeah, you knew I'd be up for it. A flash of fun will do you good. Hello - Hello. Where's all the players? There. This should be a quick game. That's not a virtual player? It's the only one here, it's real. Come on. Are you it? Wait, where you going? Chase him! Why are you chasing me? Why did you run? Because you coming at me. Time to focus. We know you're not a virtual player. Mutually observed reality ritual. Hey, hey, hey, I'm warning you, step back. Flash time. He is only a virtual. Whoa. Where'd I go? Why didn't he disappear? It's wrong. A virtual player with actual flashouts. Why aren't we feeling it? You want players? Follow me. Follow. It was my time now. I had the coordinates for perfect interception. All I had to do was intervene with their game, disrupt it in just the right way. My plan was underway, a masterfully designed intervention, finely tuned. Ladies, please let me be of service. You're cute. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... There you go. You like it? It's new. I just got it. A little birthday present. Gentle now, gentle. Interesting, the realtime hasn't run out. Interesting? I have a holorecording to get to. Sit down, take it easy. You can work it out. It's like he's been flashed out but not really. This does nothing. There's no escape game circle, virtual sounds, fake reality encoder. Are these simulations? Excuse me, that's soul music, baby. It's only her first game of InterMate. You don't seem to know what's going on. Where's the fourth player? You ladies always hitchhike this far away from traffic? You must be Canadian. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Canadian? I had diverted the women to another existing universe, chosen from the infinite realities hospitable to human life. It was a way to stress the limits of their game. Stretching it between two realities like an elastic deformation, suspended and pulled to its breaking point. I had all details worked out. Here it is. What is this? Lots of players inside. This reality, a huge spatial factor. Our second game, Lleva, expect surprises. Sure, it's an upgrade. Virtual players, now virtual flashouts. I made the choice to confront them in a crowded situation. To disorient them. To split one of them away from the other two. Hey old dude, I bet you miss the disco days, huh? No insult, I'm a huge fan of the eight-track. Just now appeared, uh, arrived. Good timing, your '70's world is back. My world doesn't matter. Got that right, universe sucks. We're all part of the same sucky reality game. Universes kept separate always. That's the reality game. You rule, dude. You a Nintendo core fan or still playing Donkey Kong? Just use the humans to short circuit InterMate. Humans? Three women playing with chaos. Hacking into, corrupting the multiverse. You use chicks? Like live chicks? It doesn't matter, it is nothing you would notice. These chicks, they here? I do not care what becomes of them. As long as their game is destroyed. Haven't we You should maybe come with me. Only I could break the rules of their four player game. By getting one of them alone. Using her to activate my plan. Soon, I only had to watch and wonder. Why do human body forms have this compulsion towards mass wiggling, as if in this reality mindlessness is somehow necessary. I refuse to get stuck here. Playing this game was a big mistake. The game's not functioning, seems jammed, and not just the flash. It was the situation I wanted, a neutral reality to disorient them. For all I know, you're incompetent players. Both of you. This reality won't collapse by itself. We've got to the find the fourth player. Where's Lleva? I never balled any of his friends yet. Hey, buy some molly? Virtual, just simulated. Pharmaceutical, moron! Lleva! I feel like these people are starting to look real. Well maybe we're the virtual people. It's like you're reading my mind. I'm having these insights. Well, wake up. I'm missing another holorecording. Doesn't matter, Desa. We've got to stick together to get this game unstuck. You guys stay stuck. I don't have your kind of timeless time to figure this out. Desa, wait! I feel like someone's playing with this reality. Not now, Lleva, we're losing Desa. Slowly! They tell me fast, fast! I wanna eat slowly! They tell me fast! Fast! Fast! Fast!...fast! Fast! Fast! I'll be in my room in two minutes. I want her young, I want her slim, and most of all, I want her fast, like now. Yo, out of the way, douche bag. Not a mere routine work order. Wow, here already? Are you the player? Am I ever, baby. Oh yeah, baby. Ohhhh! Hello. Hello. Hi, what's going on? Did this guy double order? Are you from an agency? Or did you get an independent call? Uh. Uhmm... Speak up 'cause I had an appointment with this guy right now. I am Desa. Great, hi Desa. Did you jack my client or what? He is not a player. Well, he might not be a player but I am. Wait up a second. What are you doing? Look, hey, back there. What was that? It's a game. A game, so you control it, because it was excellent. I just need to find my friends. There's more of you? Here. Is that what you're looking for? Thank you. Yeah, how it works. It's like a kennel that moves, now get in. Desa! Desa. Hi - Ahh... Good to find you alone. What? I don't have time. A little only attention, it's important. Hey! Iastar. Desa. Hands off the lady, slime. The guy's filth. Wait, I am not. Purely accidental. Umm, coincidence. Ummm... Normal local habitant. Okay, perv. You two are friends? Us three. What happened to Lleva now? We have to find her. The door's this way. Let's go. They tell me fast! I wanna eat slowly but they tell me fast! Fast! I wanna eat slowly, slowly, they want. Where did she go? My car's parked across the street, come on. Fast! I wanna eat slowly. They tell me, they tell me fast! fast! Whoo! Round, nobody gets round anymore. Jesus, fuck. Simple cellular programing. How would you like to take a ride with me? On this? Yes, on this, a bike, a bus. Shit, I'll even let you pull the train. Why don't you jump on? I'm gonna need you to hold tight. Oh, those are my friends. DESA, IASTAR: Lleva! Damn, they're your friends? Uh-huh. Tell you what, why don't you tell 'em to run with us? What's up, girl? Where you going? [airplane engine starts up What was that? Are looking for a gang bang? What are you doing? We can't get hurt. This is a micro-universe. It may be micro but it's always real. You can get killed here. A game is guaranteed safe. Yeah, well you better ask for a refund. I thought it was supposed to be a simple job. Still, I figured I'd been resourceful. I had credentials, currency, all in order. Radio Telescope Antenna Complex The walk here had gone on and on. Into the dark but I had a reason. My assignment, a routine repair, disable a certain quantum interference. Nevermind, it's weak work orders. I had a more permanent remedy, my own plan to protect the multiverse. This InterMate game needed to be so it had never even existed. Those three women, my key to severing my outstretched link from their world to this world, blowing out their outlaw game. I knew I could do that. I just had to find them again. It's warm already. We got one more observation. Like piss. It's a stellar source frequency in NGC3516. Just what I need, overtime. Ah... Reality readout. Search three unit anomaly, locate. Class Four reality. Mega-universe Y321E48, expansion type two. What? I thought I heard something. Wait, that is my universe. I did not ask for memory. You have neglected to select appropriate adjustment programs. Please re-access. Why did I have to choose this entropy infested universe? No auto quantum pairing communicode service. It's just tracking Voyager 2. Are you listening? There are three additional beings mislocated in this reality. No multiversal fluent conversate service this interverse node. So language it your way. Your function to repair. As Licensed Reality Repair Agent, you are programmed for precise protocols. I am not programmed. Ahh, except language. I have a work order, locate anomaly. A triumph of analysis, processing near random events in the sample field. Just give the locationary reading. Always have your locationary coordinates. Find do I where the players. Your anomaly coordinate data adjusted for local communicode interface. It is my job on the talk we are blocking. 900-555-0198. Reference numbers again. I know galactic prefixes. I have to been to numberless parallel universes. Not reference. Telephone number. Anything? Emergency. Backfeed, nine signal minimode. What's going on? The dish, it's sweeping! Cut the power! Hey, where's your hard pass? No! What the hell are you doing here? All right game over, pal. Come on. Ohhh! Well it's great. Yeah, it's a whole new product. Oh, it is better than full service. Is it kinky? It's beyond kinky and it's ours exclusively. Hold on. You are all that they're asking for. Not that they don't love you, Nastya. Or you, Angel. You're just the new flavor. Yeah, so what's it gonna be? Okay great, I'll have you give your information to Nastya and then we'll be right over. This new ad is working great. You girls are gonna find your fourth player or whatever it is. Just trust me. I don't get this, I don't get any of it. Well, better than being on the streets, right? So like, how do you, you know... do that without doing it? A technique of mental focus. Then flash bam? Exactly. I have to be careful. It happens too easily in this reality. Do you think there is a reality? Karen says there are dances here. Lap dancing. Like in the Hologuild legends. Like in Cactus Strip Lounge. I like that, live performance. Way live, honey. No simulation but real. Normally, I balance phoneme to function ratios. I am sure you do. Normally we weren't meant to disturb our reality. No games, just live in it. Yeah. Like there's some kind of cosmic law. Yeah. I should've been out of this reality long ago. At least I had a second chance, a locationary number from this world. I really needed it. I lost my multiverse meter. I had to find one of the women. Get her alone, short circuit her reality game. Or I'd be stuck in this motel universe forever. Hello, extra sensual flashouts. Coordinates, I mean, number for three travelers. To fly you where? You have them, the women? Of course women, escorts. Escorts. We have the best, first class. Where to send them? You send them? Then who are you? Wait, you make fun about me? I mean... I've been with trouble to know who I am today. Ohh, poor honey. I right away fix you. Three new escorts to take you out of this world. Three that will... No, no, Just want one. Townhouse Motel, room 156. Fine, one escort, Townhouse Motel, room 156. Prepare blast off. I kept telling myself it was a simple job. Their own game would destroy itself. Soon as I could activate the flashout effect with one of them alone. She'd think I'd be just another virtual person. She wouldn't know who I am. Is this the usual? Yeah, you collect payment, flashout, off we go. I don't see the point. Don't you get bored with this? Yes, but I just take these. Go ahead, try one. What are they? Get you loaded. PCP spiked with a time-release equivalent of amyl nitrate. Then I add a dash of ketamine hydrochloride. With this, real people don't bother you. They're just a bunch of worms. I'm fine. Suit yourself. It's open. You're the perv. You stopped me at the hotel. Yes, but come left in. These are proper circumstances for us. You're not like the other so-called similar simulations here. Because I saw you before. Before they had your locationary code. I'll make it double the trouble usual. Big come now. Just one of those little flash-flashes for me, and then we'll be doing fine. I suppose there's no harm. What are you doing? Your neck, look at your neck. Ohhh! Angel! Angel! Awww! Hey! Get in the car. I'll collect payment. Fry enough gray matter to make you nice. Now swallow that, there you go. Have fun with that, shithead. What the hell's going on? What kind of animal you let in here? The dude inside is cranked. Something unnatural about him. What happen to your famous flashout zap-out? It's a mental focus, fear blocks it in this reality. What in the name of the lord? Get me out of this mind! Angel dust? What did you do to the lamp? Keep people in their own whirls... words... worlds. Did you just take a dump on my bed? Watch out, behind you! In front of you! Are you one of the shitheads? Ahhh! Oh hell. Shitfire. Can't get out of this mind. Either reality is very fragile or my mind is. I have to find out what's in those micro-crystals. Maybe quantum pairs. It's unknown materials science! This makes no sense, Frank. It's an impossible device. I got a voice readout. Couldn't have repeated any numbers but it did. You know, a guy breached security and he roughed up a tech. I want to know who he works for. Not for anyone on this planet. Look, this is extreme game changing technology. You know, you spend your days and nights listening to the universe, trying to see if there's anything else out there. You really think now the cosmos just dropped proof into Annette's lap. Idiot. You think it's Siri, Frank? Look at it! There no semi-conductors, no friendly lady microchips. It's not earthly technology. You know, it's not your department. You brought this to me. It's a security breach. If we don't know who the user is we're gonna ship it off to Washington. They'll bury it! I had to develop new techniques just to access it, which got me a voice readout, a series of numbers. A code? Okay, well, we're gonna ship it off to Fort Meade. They'll decode it. I already did. Just one phrase only, a phone number. I'm checking it out now. You might want to sit down. A phone number? And only I know it. So Frank, you wanna track down the source of this device? Oh geez. Right. Turns out they have a serious front operation. They'll send over a woman that will take you out of this world. It's crazy stuff. I'm working on it. Time for our medicine. It is not me. Space habitat agents didn't it. Door them in, trap them... their game. Lemme get me get them! We're not coherent yet, are we? This body programmed for good English. Don't worry. We get recreational OD's all the time. Hold it, baby, there you go. Little pills superimpose pseudo reality. Make mind leak out. You'll be fine in a moment. Hello, extra sensual flashouts. Needing girl, quick. You are where? Counting Hospital. County Mental Hospital. For leaving .. out. Getting out this afternoon? Big help me. You deserving escort. Has to be one of the flashy new ones. Oh, hell no. They have a game, game within our game, InterMate. They could learn to create themselves. Ahhh! ...Awww! Ahh, I'm beginning to diswant keeping people out of their own realities. I know just how you feel. It's the Protectors, Protectors of the Multiverse. They can't let just anyone create universes, tip incomprehensible balances, disrupt the forces of space and time. You wouldn't want to risk the disintegration of all existence, would you? So the Protectors, they're paranoid, aren't they? Huh? That's not really my concern. Mm-hmm. Come on, baby. You a strange one, baby. Just what I need for when the next player decides to get rough. Yeah, next time I might not be there to save your ass. I won't stand being thrown around. It won't happen again, Iastar. Not in any universe, I'm through playing your game. Look, I've given each of you a phone and I've shown you how to use it, so I can track where you're at or you can call me. You're still looking for your fourth player, right? I mean, do we really have a choice, Iastar? We are homeless on this universe. Extra sensual flashouts, girls that take you out of this world. Yeah, got your request. We were busy. That's kinda far. Yeah, see what we can do. Who was that? RTA. That tech bitch again? Yup. Well, I told you to blow her off. She offered to pay double this time. It doesn't matter. Who is RTA? Space place, rockets and junk like that. They'll take you out of this world. I can't have you girls become a lab experiment. They're always looking for friends of yours. You know, little green men type. Where were you educated? This toxic planet? Yeah... why? I'll take this RTA job. What? Iastar, you're not gonna take that job. Iastar! Would you get her back here please? Thank you so much. Hey, we need you back inside. Will you take me there, to this RTA? Karen thinks it's not worth it. This worth it? Oh yeah. Desa, sweetie, go see what's up. I don't want you girls getting separated. Okay, I guess we did come as a trio act. Lose someone? Yeah. My friends, they just walked out. Yeah, I saw 'em drive off a second ago. Where? Right up the street. You want a ride? Would you mind? Not at all. I'm Matthew. Desa. Well it's nice to meet you, Desa. I like your nails. Thank you. One of the nicest things you can do. Help someone out. My, uhh... escort. You know who I am? Quick, let's go. Push me out. Like normal. Like normal? In this world, if we do not leave now, it could be your last collapse. Collapse, as in InterMate? Ahhh... Can't taste time now. Push me. Ahh... Ahhh. You keep track of visitors but don't bother us. Paging Dr Stateman, Dr Stateman please. So, where are they? You said they were just ahead. Did I say that? Yes, you did. You look so healthy. You're lucky, you can come home with me. You don't understand. You could just write 'em a note, explain it later. Write them a note? But I'm looking for my friends. And I'm helping you. Then how much further are they? Not far. No one's gonna be there. When we get to where we're going, I want you to get out of the car, take off all your clothes for me. Would you get whatever that is away from me, please? See, I'm an okay guy. And I'm an okay girl. I'll take that. No phones, Desa. If you tell anyone about this, I'll make sure we see each other again. Real soon. Do you wanna see me again? No, I don't think you're an okay guy. They always say that. We flashout now. Now is a good chance. It takes four of us to break the link with this reality. This is a two player game. I selected a four player. Me, Iaster, Desa. I selected a two! Flashout now! Even if you did, the others do not belong. Now come on, you want to get out of this universe, don't you? Of course I do but I can't leave my friends. I take your word. Ah... it must be a tangle in the crossed InterMate channels. These things really aren't uncommon. I haven't thought of that. But it means you and I have to flashout now. Then we can all return. Obviously I can't end this game without you, but even if you're right... If I am right? You will see. You have no stuff to lose. If I am wrong, no harm. No, you must relieve me. There is beally no problem. You can trust me. This crazy world is making you suspicious. Yeah, of you. You are wasting too touch time. You seem confused how to play. No one knows this game better than me. Then tell me, how did the channels get tangled? How? Ahhh? Double asymmetrical focal points. A rare unstable configuration. Before you said that's not uncommon. Now it's rare. What? No. Listen, we have to follow out of here. And what about your garble-mouth? There's something you're not telling me. I am telling me we need each other, to get out of this universe. First agree, we consult all four players. Hey! Awww! All right, what did you say he had now? A pink neck. Huh. I never seen a patient like him before. All right, hold on. Code 2, this is Larry 381. Yeah, I got a male mental 451, possible 211. Subject is medium build with a pink neck. Copy that, I'll send it out on the radio. Gonna be a long night. Hope they come soon. Oh boy. You're so pretty, you know that? Always like to tease me. Look, I'm available on Thursday. Would Thursday be good for you? Wow, that was some performance. You are quite the actress, Desa. Just cooperate 100 percent. I could do you a favor. Yeah, what's that? Flash you out. Yeah. It's a wonderful experience. Really? This kind of wonderful? I read this story about a girl. A girl who thinks she's dreaming. Except she wakes up and she finds out that she's in reality. I was gonna get out of this reality. Sorry, Desa. This is the real world. I'm not from this universe. See, now you're lying, Desa. I'm not. And I hate liars! You fucking liar! Lleva! Jesus, finally someone checks in with me. Are you at the hospital? I'm with a dangerous player. Pink neck. He violates the rules of all realities. What? I need to get out of here. Wait, out of where? Tell me where you are, Lleva. It's simple. It is much better if we de-align from this reality now. Not without my friends. Lleva! Where are you, kid? I can force you. They're only worms here. Get away, I'll scream. Let's talk this upper. After you give me back my phone. You don't me understand! I'm telling the real truth this time. Can I help you? I don't know, can you? You know this is one big massive security breach, right? Yeah, talk to your boss. Annette asked us to come. Why didn't you say that? Ahhh... What's your name? Wouldn't you like to know? I would actually. I like your jumpsuit. Thanks. I bet you'd look even better without it. There we go. Yeah, that's better. It feels better. Is that a hard hat? Yeah, yeah, you wanna try it on? I like hard things. It's a little dirty. It's all right and it's ribbed. Be careful, it might be tight. So what do you do here? I work inside. I see you have a really big dish. Psionic pulse reference. Fifth continuum parameter analog, okay? Elementary stuff. What is this about? The crystals, Frank. They contain electrons imprisoned by molecular lattices. Entangled across time-space constraints by spin pairs. Myriads of 'em. It's a quantum supercomputer but more. It's tremendous! You really do know about this meter thing? It's a cross-dimensional analysis meter, but not for InterMate. But, InterMate? A reality game but not just mini-realities, extreme realities. It's from a kind of super advanced game. Not a game, it's a new paradigm! Okay, let's forget about paradigm. What about that guy who dropped the device, who is he? Yeah, not just who, but where? You know who he is? No, no, stop her. I need to know how it's done, the quantum engineering. I've answered all I can. I don't build this stuff. No, no, wait, wait, we need you. I thought you'd be able to help, that you'd be the fourth player. Wait. What can I do to persuade you to stay? I'm sorry. This never happened to me before. That's too bad. You deserve a little perk of the job, right? So, maybe there's somewhere better that we can go. I need the phone! It's not working. You got to turn it on. Iastar, where are you? Your phone's been off. I've got to talk to Lleva and Desa. Yeah, me too. Look, Lleva is messed up. She's on a date with some lunatic with a pink neck. Pink neck? Yeah, said he talks like you. He's violating reality rules. I don't know, she sounded really panicked and then the call just dropped out. It's that perv from the motel. It's his meter. A rogue player, no, not a player, something else. He could short circuit the game. What? Where's Lleva? Ahhh! I know we're looking for the same guy. I can help. Hold on, okay, one second. Let me pull this up. I was able to get GPS on Lleva's last call, the Plaza Park Mall Arcade. Do you know where Plaza Park Mall is? Yeah. Iastar, it's me Nastya. Where the keys? Look, I need you. Karen and me, we're called to frat party. My body can't take it more. I need for you doing flashouts. Okay, give me that. Iastar, hold on. Listen, I was saving this for something special but I just wanna tell you now. I'd like to make you a partner. So, I just need to come on back. I can't, Karen, but I will always remember this. I'm concerned for you, Iastar. Hello? Hello? Be careful doll. Where's the meter! What did you do? Hand it over to me! Move, go! It's government property. It is mine! You bastard! Frank! Frank, Frank! Okay, so what happened to me? I hallucinated some time-energy-space thing. It's an enhanced charge. I'm carrying the entropy of two parallel universes, plus one mini universe. Can you just start from the beginning? It's sort of primitive from here. This guy, he's some kind of outsider. He diverted us to this world. We were playing a four player game, InterMate. He tried to flash me out to short circuit the game reality. So, it's his reality game. No, ours, we ride small short lived mini-realities. His game is much bigger. You saw the logo on his meter. The Mobius strip? The dimensional curve, it's like a brand name, for the universe game. For all possible universes with everybody in them, even you. And this guy, or whatever he is, manipulating the universe game, performing some deranged reality experiment. At the Plaza Park Mall? All along, one whole premise of my plan was screwed. It takes cooperation to activate the flashout. Right then I felt like letting her go. Let them control reality. Create it, destroy it, choose their own. But I had my job. That's what makes us civilized, right? Hey, she got a purse. So, dude, don't take the purse. You need a new purse, yo? What happened? You pass out on the pizza? She got maybe somethin' better to do, fuckface. "Serial Killers", you play with them, don't you? Play? No, I never do, I have a holorecording to get to. Hey, I got a record. Wanna hear it? You fuckin' leave her alone. It's in here. I don't remember. Ahhhh! Dude, seriously? You gonna be okay? Let's eat. Can we get three burgers, three fries. Make it five burgers. Three drinks. You have to believe me. The truth. I can get you out of this fix. I am a reality repairman. I am not normally in a universe like this. I never go to your space habitat universe. There is a much bigger game. I know I am routine maintenance but it is an important job. Like the last universe, routine mega-matrix, replacing a simple field anomaly, next thing you know you feel your baryons contract, the intervolic windows turn black, your... You really believe all that? For real though, I just hope he didn't spit in it this time. Yeah, I hope he did more than that. Ready to get tweaked. I'm just kidding. Help yourself. I am sorry, Mom, but we are alone. It's okay, these are my friends. Yeah, we're her friends. Yeah, tasty friend. We can not be divided. Well, aren't we rude? Lewd, did you say lewd? Are you an idiot? You can not take me out of me doing my job. 'Ludes, you say you got 'ludes? Playing, think you are playing. None of this is important. I represent a being with extraordinary powers. Alien, papers please. Yeah. Earthworms. If you persist in interfacing with me. I... Fuck you, asshole. Fuck me? Mm-hmm. Asshole? Out of my way. Whoa, whoa, hey, easy, boy. What the fuck is that? What is that shit, man? If Lleva's still with him, she's not answering and who knows whether they're still at the Plaza Park. Wait, is her phone on your account? Huh? We can use a mobile locator. Here, give it to me. He couldn't be more dangerous. We're all created and packaged by his game. I wish I had that kind of control. Billions of universes, infinite singularities. Billions and billions of Big Bangs. We're inside one now. You know you speak pretty fancy English for someone who's a space alien. My world exists right here. I'm human, like you. But from a parallel, alternate present. Or don't you get it? You mean event horizons and wormholes in hyperspace. So, you're human, just from the other side of here. So you do get it. Oh, I'm getting her GPS, it's not far from here. Dude had this powdery pink neck. Hold on. This is 3 Larry 81, disturbance at the drive-in. Yeah, we got the wild man from county. Suspect is on foot, over. Hey, you okay? God, that was weird. I wanted to quit right there. It was the creeps, I tell you, and I was homesick too. You figure it out. You are going to let me flash us out, now! It is time to make this underwith. Or make sure you never see another reality again. Mutual observed reality ritual. You know the technique! I finish my job one way or another. Lleva! Do not interfere. It is not your four player game anymore. You don't dare hurt her. You'll get stranded here yourself. You have no way, no way of knowing that. Get back, you'll distort the process. It is a two player game. Ahhh! Ahhh! No, no, you'll dislocate the real time! Oh yes! Ohh! Mmmm... Seems like years since we did it that way. You feel what I'm feeling. Oh, I'm feeling it. You always get me there, Frank. But... But what? This time, I don't know, it felt strangely different. Ouch. No, I mean, different, great. Like it was our first time. Frank. What? This was our first time. Okay, I'll play along. No, look, we were just there on that hillside moments ago. The Earth universe, Frank. Angel's car, the RTA room. Metaphysics, really? We were always here. Yes, here. The RTA, the radio telescope complex... Annette. You mean all that, that was real? We were there and we were always here too... this time. Our history's been changed. And... Seems we're not in the same habitat I came from either. We're in a similar but other parallel universe. Okay, now I'm clear. Our bizarre flashouts with the wrong players, Frank, it twisted and overlaps the space time geometry, creating two simultaneous universes. Hi lovers, we've got a call from Lleva. Hey kids, time for a quick round of MetaMate? Found an awesome channel for us, great reviews. Should be fun. We're in a whole other version of our habitat world and this is no longer a mini-reality game. Let's do it! All this tripping around. Here, there, okay. I get it. Now we can enter all the players from any one device. All set, kids, no prob'lies. Our newest four player game crew together again. His game is ours now. And we control it. That perv, he wanted to kill InterMate, and we beat him or it. Now we have access to everywhere and everywhen. Thanks to one strange deranged player. They're starting it up. It's actually happening for real. Frank, you know what this means? We can now choose any realities together! Any Earth we want, Frank. Any universe we want. All the space-times of the grand multiverse! This universe is ending, it really is, isn't it? There's plenty more versions of it. I always liked this one. Let's do it. Really blew it. Screwed it up. I don't know what really happened to those women. I don't know for sure but that was a long time ago. Shouldn't have any trouble now with your televironment. But I'll tell you getting a hold of these old parts ain't so easy. Yep, this set's from the punk zone. Classic, like I used to be. If you get interrupted by any of those weather shows, your set will switch automatically to your favorite commercial. Call anytime you need me. You do plumbing? In a curious way, I feel relieved. I feel, wasn't this always reality? I've even given up resuming my natural shape, too vulnerable. I wouldn't even want to. I must admit wondering now and then, what happened to InterMate? Maybe it was destroyed, maybe there was some sort of time warp, a side effect. Maybe some other repairman has been sent to rescue me, and I only have to wait until space-time comes full circle. But I no longer really care or remember all too well. Much of the Miami Dade area is no more today, as vast areas of shoreland have collapsed.
