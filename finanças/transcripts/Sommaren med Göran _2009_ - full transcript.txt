-Hi. -Hi. -What are we doing? -You'll see. -Do you need help? -I'll be fine. -Are you okay? -Yeah. There. Can you see the Chapman boat from here? I don't know. Time to tell me what this is all about. -We get along well, don't we? -We also fight more than anyone. I was trying to talk about the positive aspects. Let's focus on that. I think I've figured out why things haven't worked out. -I haven't dared to commit. -Come on, we've done this before. -Shush. -Don't shush me! Let me finish. I love you, Sophia. I'll never find anyone else who's 10% the woman you are. I'm ready to commit now, to do those things that you want. Like getting little kids- -and buying a small house in a cozy suburb of your choice. Cutie pie! I could even subscribe to a morning paper. Cutie pie! But that would require you to make an effort too. -Don't tell me I haven't tried. -Shush. I'm trying to... I'm asking you to marry me. I'm sorry. Try to throw up. There was a ring in the glass. Relax. Try to get it out. How could you put the ring in the glass? That's dangerous! -I thought you'd see it. -I could have choked! No, you couldn't. The ring was tiny. A tiny ring? How very generous of you! Are you going to get pissed off when I'm proposing? Excuse me? Is that a tone to take- -with a woman you say you want to share your life with? -You're a complete moron! -Well, maybe I don't want that! -You're...stupid! -And so are you. Go to hell, you idiot! I hate you! I never want to see you again! Don't worry! You won't have to! NO ADVERTISING, EXCEPT FOR REAL ESTATE SUPPLEMENTS -Hi, Anne. How are you? Is Alex in? -Yes. We're just finishing moving in, as you know. -Did it go well? -Sure. Too bad you couldn't help out. Right. Maybe I can help out now instead. -Hi there. -Hey. -How are things? -Just fine. Alex, imagine if Göran had been here all day. -What were you thinking? -I don't know. It felt right at first. Alex, don't attach the legs to the bed. I'll do it later. Did you have to propose? This is worse than with Anneli! -It is not! -You proposed to her too. -Right, and she said yes. -And what did you say then? That we should wait because I wasn't certain. Exactly. Five seconds after she accepted. How are things with Sophia? On, off? On or off? -Off. -It must be tough on her. -Right. Or tough on me. -Or her. Did you apply for that job I told you about? Right... No, it didn't work out. Why look for a new exciting job when you can whine about your old one? There are still some boxes downstairs you could bring up. But not the china. It would be too bad if something happened. Right, no china. -What? I was going in there. -Sorry, didn't see you. -Are you blind? -You should hurry more. You're nuts! -Sorry! -Seriously, Göran. I can't tell from the schedule when it starts. Alright, time for a quick run-through. For you newcomers, this is Event Factory CEO Hans Kjällén. -Do you want to say anything? -Go for it! -Go for it! -Thank you, Hans. At 13:02 Martin Timell and CEO Arne Buhr will welcome everyone. At 13: 20, The Real Group will sing "Yesterday" in a fun way. 13: 35, Cirkus Cirkör eat fire and juggle an animal. And then it's time for Markoolio. I guess that's it. Sorry, one more thing. Grynet is a photographer- -who will be working with us until Midsummer. -That'll be fun. -Thank you. ...then all sorts of things happened, and I told him... A banking song? Come on! Nobody writes banking songs. I don't treat people differently, it's that simple! What a great statement. Alright, so you'll do that one about ragtime summer. Thanks, Markus. 13:02 is when you go on. -Help him out. Just go! -The Real Group want clean towels. -What are you doing? -I'm the photographer for the event. -Shouldn't you be in there? -This was private. I've finally found the image to put on my dart board. -Sorry. I was in a hurry. -Unlike me, first day on the job. Göran, this is Greger Bengtzon, CEO of Megaphone Telecom. This is Göran Wallin, our event creature. -Greger Bengtzon. -Your event is the Midsummer one. Greger is here to see how we work on our bits and pieces- -and get some ideas on artists. Okay, boys. Burn some rubber! I have a list of artists we work with... I'd really like to see the Crown Princess there. I can tell you that might be difficult. If she can't make it, Nelson Mandela would be awesome. What does he tend to charge? No, the fish has to go out at the same time! -Timell wants to cut the last item. -He can't do that. -You'll have to tell him. -Alright, let him do it. -Göran to Max. -He's the surprise artist. -They're thirsty. -Get them some soda! We're done for the day and tearing down the stage. -Cirkus Cirkörs animal has escaped. -That's okay, leave it. I'll deliver them on Tuesday. Thank you. Well, Göran, we just about pulled that off. I have to say that the production was very sloppy. I thought it worked out pretty well. The customer is "satisfied". Which means disappointment in the lack of grandeur. So I think it's of major importance to satisfy Greger at Megafon. I think it would be great if you could... Excuse my French, but if you could just suck up to him a bit. -That's be good for both of us. -Of course, Hasse. Hans! My name is Hans. - How hard can it be? -Good day at work? -Please, I've already apologized. Which was big of you. Are you always this frazzled? -Yes, that's part of arranging events. -So quit, if you don't like it. -But I do like it. -No, you don't. Maybe not. -Anyway, I'm Grynet. -Fun name. I'm Göran. -Also an ugly name. -Thank you. You're interesting. You're almost see-through, which I find fascinating. -I bet you live alone. -No, your bachelor radar is off. -I actually proposed yesterday. -Congratulations? How did it go? -Not good. -Really? With your charm? You're pretty predictable too. You live in the southwest, play soccer- -listen to Kent and are definitely single. -That's amazing. -How much was correct? -Not a thing. -I'm not done. You drive a small, ugly car and like to back into parking spots. Incredible. You read me like a book. -See you around. -Are you leaving? -Yes, I'm going on a date. -Exciting. What kind of date is it? The kind of date you have with Niklas from the Royal Technical College. -He's nice, well-read and calm. -Like the TV news. Congratulations. -Bye. -Bye. -Hi, Anne. Sorry I'm late. -No problem. You tend to stay till last anyway. Well...there you go. Congratulations on the new apartment. -Thanks, Göran. -Thanks. Tingeling is a hairless little Nude Hound. It's like having a baby in the house. -Hi, doggie. -Say hi to her, but don't pet her. -She doesn't trust you, remember. -I'll wait. I have allergies. -Hi, Göran. How are you doing? -Well, I'm... I don't understand how I could have dated Sophia. It's so clear to me now. You do too much thinking. You can't keep analyzing everything, You have to look ahead. Imagine if I kept thinking about the past. Then I might realize that Anne and I aren't working out. -Which I don't want to, right? -Right. -Lots of single girls here tonight. -Yeah, she's hot. -You look horny. You do! -Thank you. I would advise you to wait. But historically a variable mortgage rate is the best if you stick with it. The Stockholm archipelago is nice, but has so many trees! And no stinging jellyfish, which a real archipelago needs. I think Facebook is so passé. I'm part of a network created by strong women who are active. -I find Facebook misogynist. -I see. That's never occurred to me. It's my first big negotiation for the bank. It's a huge responsibility. Oh, your glass is empty. Let me get you one. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Have you met Göran? He's Alex's friend. Hi, I'm Dodde Bengtzon. Childhood friend of Anne's. Göran Wallin, also childhood friend, but not of Anne's. -Are you also in banking? -No, I work with events. -And you? -I'm currently at a think tank. I started it with a few colleagues. We're discussing solutions to the climate issue. -It can't be ignored. -I'm glad someone's handling it. -So, are you climate conscious? -Yes, I think I am. For instance, I don't travel much. Only when I'm going somewhere. -And that's when you travel? -Yes. Do you have plane tickets for the West Coast yet? For Midsummer's Eve. You're welcome, Göran. Me and my dad usually have a bash on our island. Haven't you Midsummered on the West Coast? Then you've never done it right. I'll be in Frankfurt and Alex has to take care of Tingeling. -Right, so we can't do it this year. -It's your loss. -Summer in the air. -Yes. Right. I told Klara we should book early this year. So we booked two weeks on the Amalphi Coast in January. At that... Hold on one second. Honey, what was that place we're going to? Ravello. This is Petronella from Honeymoon Trips. I've arranged a rhino trek in Upper Volta... Hi, Göran. Sophia here. I'm sorry it had to end this way. If you could send me my Prada scarf, that'd be nice. The engagement ring has made its way out, so I'll send it to you. It's a bit discolored from cleaning solution or something. Bye. Hi. I'd like to check if it's okay to return rings. -Yes, if you have the receipt. -It's slightly discolored... -Göran? -Yes... -It's me, Linnea. -Linnea... Linnea Cassel! Hi! Wow, I hardly recognized you. Weren't you a bit...heftier? -You sat next to me in Chemistry. -Biology. But then we moved to France. -Right. And? -And? Doing fine. I arrange events. It's stressful- -but it's fun and you grow a little bit every day. And you? Well, I run this store, and I blog online about jewelry trends. Well, I'll have to surf over there and see what's on offer. So? Married, kids, house? -Dog? Just kidding. -Not that I know of. That'll all come in due time. I'm kind of the same...single. -Did you want to return a ring? -Me? No. If you excuse me, I have a customer. -Good to see you again. -Likewise. -We could... -Bye. Bye, Linnea. I'm trying to reach the Crown Princess' agent. The Marshal of the Court, right. There's no one else...? Of course. How about Dag Finn? No? And Anki Bagger can't...? No. Okay, thanks. Bye. This is me with Pigalle. We ride every evening. -Hi, Hasse. -Hans. What did you and Greger Bengtzon decide? Right. Nothing special, really. He had some special requests. Why are they doing it on Midsummer? Göran, there's one thing you have to learn. We're here for the customer. He points the way and we follow. Be open and keen. Those are the watchwords. See this as the most important Midsummer of your life. -But Midsummer's Eve... -You'll have to skip the frog dance. -So I can still do the dance? -No, you'll have to skip it. -Great. Should we start planning...? -I have to go to Provence. But I'll be back in time for the events. I want to be surprised, Göran. I want to feel proud, happy...proud. Did I say happy? Damn. You don't get those if vacation is important. About those certificates, did they stop awarding them? Hurry up and take care of this now. Hasta la vista, baby. Samuel! It's making that hard noise again. I just pushed that. -Is that your thinking cap? -Hi. No, I'm going riding, of course. -I didn't know you were a horse lover. -Maybe not "lover", but... I think interaction with the rider is more interesting than with the horse. -Are you going on a date? -Yes. The line between a man who tries too hard and a psycho is razor thin. This is a good way to meet her in a relaxed setting. -How much riding have you done? -At work - and at the zoo. Well, good. I thought you were a beginner. -I'm just a tad allergic too. -Hi, Niklas. -How are you, honey? -Not great. The econ guys won 4-2. This is Niklas. - And this is Göran, currently a coworker. Hi. So, you're the guy from the tech school? The Royal Technical College. I'm going to go riding, so... -Should you really walk behind them? -Why not? -Because they kick. -That depends on the horse. Right, it depends on the horse. This is Lazy, and she basically doesn't kick at all. Do you have one that's a tad taller? She's one of our biggest Icelandic horses. Any bigger horse is fine. Maybe an American pony? You want a bigger horse? Take Black Sabbath. -Or Lazy will be fine. -Exactly. Nice outfit. Thank you. Stop. -Göran? Do you ride here? -Yes. Linnea, right? -Yes. -Exactly, this is where I ride. -I've never seen you here before. -It's a pretty big club. -Not really. -No, but horses are amazing animals. Aren't they? It's great that you feel that way too. -Nobody seems to ride any more. -I know. Horses are intelligent, but above all, I think they have integrity. Exactly! Which way are you going? That way. -How's the jewelry going? -Great. I've started designing some myself. My goal is to be bigger than Efva. I'm very inspired by Asian pieces in nickel silver. -What kind of jewelry do you like? -Necklaces. Armbands too. Wonderful. I think I have to give Pigalle a really good run. I'll ride hard later. Could I have your number? -Why? -I was just thinking...I don't know. 0700 44 39 91. -Wait! -44 39 91! I'll call later! I'll call you later, okay? 0700 44 39 91...0700 44 39 91... 0700 44 39 86... 0700 44 39 87. -Hi, Linnea? -What did you say? -Linnea, I think. -If you're telemarketer, fuck off! ...91. Linnea. -Hi, Linnea. Göran here. -Hi, Göran. The stud from the stables. Just kidding. So...I was wondering if maybe you'd want to- -maybe have dinner on Friday, if you want. -On Midsummer's Eve? -Oh, right. I'm going to the West Coast to visit Dodde Bengtzon. Do you know him? That's great! I'm going there too! Well, I'll see you there, then. -But didn't you want to...? -No, I'm going there on Friday. So no time for dinner, but I'll see you there. -Yes. -Bye. Ouch. GOOD TO SPEAK TO YOU. SEE YOU SOON. HOPE YOU HAVE SOME FUCK THIS MIDSUMMER. -Hi, Anne. I didn't wake you, did I? -What do you think? -Is Alex...? -Why whisper? I'm already awake. What were you expecting, ringing the doorbell at 22:00? That someone would open the door. What's Alex doing? -What do couples do at this hour? -Sorry. -What are you doing? -Hi! I was thinking, on Midsummer's Eve, Anne is going away- -and I remembered Dodde's party on the West Coast. Why don't you and I go there- -borrow your uncle's ugly sailboat and sail to the party? You can't show up in the middle of the night like this anymore. -We're living together now. -Anne doesn't need to know! Alex, the love of my life is coming to this party. -You have to agree. -I'm in charge of Tingeling. Since when do you care about that animal? That animal is like a dog to me! -I'm not leaving until you agree. -No! Yeah, Alex! We're pretty young, after all, aren't we? Don't shout. I have to be back by 18:00 tomorrow. Not at quarter to or anything, but at six o'clock. Alright! I told you, I have to work then, I have an event. -Let's try to have some fun instead. -Okay. -So, what's the deal with this girl? -I don't know, but it was just... She's so awesome. And she seems together. I think this is 100%. You've got to understand that it's never 100%. Never. Take me and Anne. That's maybe 80-85%. And you have to make do with that or maybe stay single forever. -It might feel 100% right to try. -No, 90. It can never be higher. -According to studies. -Says who? -Anne. -Anne? -Is that your Uncle Lorens? -Yes, it is. Hi. I really appreciate you lending us the sail boat. -Fine, but I don't like it. -We're very grateful. -You have your master's certificate? -I got it last fall. -And you as well? -Yes. Also last fall. -Do you see the red button? -I think so. That's the mains switch. Never forget to turn that off. -Okay. -So, how long have you been sailing? About ten years. Then why don't you go below and fetch me my starboard? -No... -Just some West coast humor. -That was a good one. -Yes, it was. Yes. -Use the charts, boys! -I'd rather use tables! -Just some East coast humor. -Only slightly funny. Three shrimp out of five, maybe. ...the dragon comes up, grabs the princess. -Untie it. -Can I at least get a chance? -It's Anne. What do I do? -Answer? -She'll hear the sails. -Just use your normal fake voice. What do you mean, "fake"? -Hi, sweetness, I miss you! -And I you. We're just starting a meeting and I need help. Are you at home? -Yes. -I forgot some papers. They're in the cupboard in the dining room. Yes... -What do I say? -That you can't find them. -I can't find them, honey. -What? Have you looked? I'll take a look in a bit, when I come home. -Didn't you say you were home? -Not completely. -But I'll be there soon. -Hurry up! Why did you say that? What am I supposed to do now? Go to a Midsummer party. I think I've got it, you pull like this... -Great knot. -That doesn't work. Wow. -Is that where he lives? -Yes. So where the hell is Linnea? -Mom, look! A sail boat. -It's probably not coming here. -Come on, jump. -Right. Damn it! What are you doing? It's okay, I'll get him! -I'll get him! -Carl-Wilhelm! -Mommy! -I've got you. -I can't swim! -Don't worry. -Well, that worked out. -Mommy! -There you go. -So you got to take a swim. -There. -Thank you so much. -It was nothing. -I'm really sorry. Excuse me, but I have a crying child to take care of. -Hi there. -I'm Göran. Welcome. Göran, could you fold the foresail. -I don't believe it. -What's the matter? -That Megafon Telecom CEO is here. -That's Dodde's dad. Why didn't you tell me? I can't be here for Midsummer if I'm doing his event tomorrow. -Everyone celebrates Midsummer. -Not everyone. Yes, they do. Dad and I want to welcome you all here. It's going to be a great Midsummer, it's in the air. Hi, honey! -Hi, I'm Göran. We met at... -Right. This is great. I'm sorry about what happened. Göran, it was a mistake. These things happen. Do you need me to help out, maybe carry something? There are some chairs down there. If you could carry them to the sundeck, that would be great. Are that many coming? Around midnight a lot of people tend to show up. -Uffe Ekberg was here last year. -The pastor? Right, the guy from Ace of Base. I've just started looking. There are just so many things here. Yes. Honey, if the papers are there... here at home, they'll show up. I don't understand. I really need you to find them. Please. Yep. -See-through Göran! -Hi. Imagine seeing you here. Niklas does long-distance skating with Dodde. Of course he does. That's a nice sport. -And that was a tic. -Yep. -I'm mostly here to be nice. -To Niklas? To myself. Last year I just downloaded "Brokeback Mountain". One of my favorite films, actually. I think it's a moving depiction- -of a forbidden... -...love. -So, "Romeo & Juliet" with two dicks? -Göran? -Oh, Linnea! Right, you were going to be here too. It's a small world. -Are you working here? -No, just helping out a bit. I have a question. It's a little embarrassing... -What was that text message about? -What do you mean? Well, you know. That you were hoping that I would get to have... -Isn't that what you say? -Is it? I just hoped you'd have a nice evening. So you hoped I'd get to have a fuck? No, the predictive text must have gotten it wrong, I meant "have fun". -So that's what that was. -So your phone dictionary has "fuck"? -Yes, I've added it. -So you two know each other? Yeah, we went to school together, actually... And you know each other too. That's nice. Excuse me, I have to... Hey, so do you need to... borrow any clothes? -No. -Alright. Things are going downhill fast with Anne. -And Dodde and Linnea are dating. -We shouldn't have come here. Then again... Can you French kiss a friend? -Stop it. I'm going. Are you coming? -Hi. I'm Mikaela. I really wanted to thank you. -It really was no big deal. -It was stupid. I'm sorry. -There's nothing like a decisive man. -Right. You'll have to excuse me if I find that sexy. -That's fine. -Thank you. I'll see you later. Alright, let's go. -Oh, right! -What's the matter? We can't sail now, I've been drinking. -One glass of champagne. -And a beer. I can't go to sea drunk. You'd had ten beers when we sailed home last weekend. You know what, Göran? I could put in a good word for you with Linnea. What kind of good word? I'll go do that. I see. Is that blue schooner yours? It belongs to Alex, but I can take responsibility for it. Could you throw on some fenders? I don't want any scrapes. Of course. We met at Tyrol. I think I'm arranging an event for you. So that was you? I happen to have facial agnosia. But I never forget a name. Kristoffer. -Göran. -No, Greger. This is a bit of a Midsummer tradition. The Dodde Bengtzon Invitational Closest to Pin Competition. You have to get as close to the flag up there as possible. Everyone gets one ball and one swing. Okay, you get to start. Good swing. Do you believe in hole in one at first sight? -Göran is a really good golfer. -I see. I'll put it starboard of the flag. -You can't say that. -I was supposed to boost you. -But not lie. -Give me some room here. Come on, Dodde. -Not a bad shot. -No, I don't play golf. That's the charm. Everyone joins in. Swedish and cozy. -Here you go. -Thanks. Come on, Göran. Tingeling! -Do something. -Mommy, wake up! -Does anyone know, like, medicine? -Tingeling! Come here. -That doesn't look good. -Mommy, I want to go home. I'm sorry. Dodde, do we have any cotton wool? -I thought you didn't play golf? -I've played a little bit. Little darling. We won't tell Mommy about this. -How is she? -I think she's gone deaf. -Mikaela? -Tingeling. -She doesn't respond to my voice. -I'm sorry. I really feel... -You're the one who wanted clothes. -I think that was me. Was it you? I'm sorry, but you see, I have facial agnosia. But now I see. It'll be nice to have some clean clothes for dinner. Dinner in the boathouse! Was he telling us? You... Hold on. -That suits you. -How nice. Looking good, Göran. -Suits you really well. -Thank you. It feels...snug. -Good body, Göran. -Thank you. -Nice outfit, Göran. -You think so? Thank you, I agree. Can I sit here without upsetting Dodde? -Why would he get upset? -If you're dating. Define "dating". -It's... How's the jewelry coming? -Great, actually. Princess Madeleine might wear one of my pieces on Victoria Day. -That's great! -I've always wanted to be creative. I've known I wanted to make jewelry since I was super tiny. It must be nice to know that young what you want to do. Well, of course. At first I wanted to be a COO. But about a year ago I knew I wanted to make jewelry. I thought you said... So you didn't know what you wanted? Yes, I did. I heard you're doing an event for Dodde's dad. Don't tell Dodde this, but Greger is really funny. He wants Nelson Mandela at the event. -How dumb. -Bananas. Wouldn't it be better to have someone famous? Much better. A toast! You smell so nice. I would never advertise with a lower price, whatever the house... -Hi, how are things with your...? -Please, sit down! Sorry. There. -...your nose? -Better. That Göran must be nuts. Göran is a good guy. He just has some bad luck from time to time. As long as you don't take people for granted. Göran takes no one for granted. And he's very well off. -Is he? -No one knows about it. Money means nothing to him. Göran is very humble. And young. And he has really beautiful eyes, don't you think? -Yes. -Right? And you too. It's really peaceful down here by the water. You have to make the most of it. And enjoy the calm. That's not what I meant. Do you have a dog? -Nice to see some culture. -Yes, she used to live in France. I understand why they sent her home. -Aren't you going to sing? -No! -I'll sign us up. -No, Grynet! I don't want to sing! Do you hear me? I thought you were gay at first. -Why? -Seriously, that dog. Oh, I see. I actually like little dogs like that. Since I'm so short myself. I have to answer this. It won't take long. -Hello? -Why the hell aren't you calling me? Happy Midsummer! Alex, listen. Tell me what's in those papers right now or I'm fired. I understand. I just now found them. Paragraph 4, how many years does the contract run? -It says five years. -Five? I thought it was three! No, I think it says five. Percentage rate for service exchange? -30%. -Great. Thanks, bye. -Problems? -Yes, probably. Hi. It's Midsummer, we're in the archipelago, we're drunk- -it's damp, we're happy. -How does it feel? -Really cozy. Really. That means I'm happy. Really happy. -Okay. -Grynet! What are you doing? Come here! Yeah, I'm coming. I'll go to the boat. -Grynet, damn it! -Calm down. Midsummer night complications. When youth goes love-crazy from the juice Puck drips in its eyes. -Shakespeare. -Oh. "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Have you read it? No. I think I might have seen the movie at one point. To be young... ...is to have all your dashed frustrations before you. Torvald Gahlin. Did he say that? No, fuck it. I'm going to the sauna. Would you care to join me? I think I'll skip it. You can skip right into the water. It's deep enough. Are you...? Right. Grynet, I understand that things can happen. I've done a lot of stupid things while drunk. During the hazing at the College, there was a girl... Niklas, I'm not drunk. -Then we have nothing more to say. -I'm sorry. I didn't plan... -It's really ugly, your boat. -Are you here? -I'm waiting for my admirer. -I see. And who might that be? You've worked really hard, Göran. -How do you mean? -You don't even ride, do you? No. Dodde told me you'd said no, then changed your mind about the party. I think it's because you knew I'd be here. Right? -Yeah. -I like guys who make an effort. Oh my. If Dodde shows up, things might get a little weird. -I'll be quiet. -Here, have a nut. No. I'm allergic. I shouldn't eat nuts. Come on. Will it kill you to eat just one? That was tasty. -Nice, right? -Yes, they are. -Dodde calls them his Scud missiles. -I see. -What will you call them? -I could say the same thing. A dog? -I can be a rabbit too. -Really? -A ram? -Rabbits know how to bite. This is nice, but I think maybe we should... The thing is that Grynet and I have a thing. -The weirdo with the tics? -Weirdo with tics? -Crazy Grynet. Like this. -Yeah, the weirdo with tics. -Put your hand here. Choke me. -But that's kind of dangerous. -There. Yes. Hard! Hard, I said! -Yikes! Like this! It's nice, isn't it? You know what? That was really nice, but I need to stretch my legs. Göran! I can be a guinea pig, too. -You are so nice. -You are. -No, you are. -Have you two seen Grynet? That's what I call timing. No, we haven't. What's the matter? You look sick. -Just a little swollen throat. You? -Everything's fine. So, you... Have you seen Grynet? Göran. -Why do you look like that? -That nut. You're not contagious, are you? Is there a relative here who wants to come along? He has a friend here with a dog, but I don't know where they are. If you know him, you can come. No, I don't know him. We're just acquaintances. And I promised to help clean up here tomorrow, so I can't go. -What's his name? -Göran. -He's mentally retarded. -Alright, that's good to know. Are you okay? Sorry. I think I was pretty drunk after all. I'm going to bed. Are you coming with me? In a bit. I have to check my email. -Good night. -Good night. No... -What did you say? -Hello! Are you living here now? No, that's not possible. No! -What did you say? -Hello. Hello. -You won't be living here. -No. -Is anyone picking you up? -I don't think so. Do you have a number for your Mom and Dad? No, why would I? We can't just release you in case you lose your way. Do you think I'm stupid? Yes. Are you? -Where are you? -I've been hospitalized. -They called me retarded. -Well, you are. -I had an allergic reaction. -You said we'd be home by 6. If I'd died, that might have put a damper on things. You have to hide those papers before Anna comes home and sees them. But I have an event in Stockholm in 7 hours. My keys are in your backpack in the car. I'm taking the plane. Fix this or it'll all go to hell. Let me talk to Grynet, is she there? Alexander? Alex! Taxi! Bye. Hi, Mikaela. Yesterday was really magical. Really great. But I have to go. I have to get the sailboat back. You didn't get my number. You don't have my phone number. -No, what is it? -0730 96 33 20. -Good. Now I have it. -Bye. Hi, Grynet, it's Göran. Things got weird yesterday. So maybe you could call or we'll see each other at work later. Bye. Just shut up, Tingeling! Anne? Alex? Oh, God! What are you doing? Hi, Anne. How are you? How was Germany? -What are you doing? -Me? Here? Now? I said, what are you doing? Okay. No problem. I'll tell you. I had to fix something for Alex. What about Alex? For his bachelor party. Are you high? We aren't getting married. Yes you will. If you... I just think Alex hasn't had time to propose. Alex was wondering, if it might be, that you would... If you might consider marrying him. Yes, yes! I love Alex. He's my pookie! Of course I will! Good, that's agreed, then. And promise not to tell him! -I promise. -Okay. What are you doing with my papers? So it was just three years. Why did Alex say five? Alex has had a lot to think about with the wedding. Don't get on his case. -Okay? -Okay. Congratulations. Bye. This is Alex, leave a message. Alex, it's Göran. Call me as soon as you hear this. Definitely before you speak to Anne. That's important. See you at the airport. Bye. -Alex. -Hi, honey. I'm just taking Tingeling for a long walk. Don't worry. I'm waiting for you, snookums. -You'll have to turn that off. -Of course. Sorry. -Alex, what are you doing? -I'm wondering where you are. -This is Hans Kjällén. -How was Provence? We're wondering where you are. I've had some things to do, but we're almost all set. -I'm on my way. -We need you here now! I'll be right there! -Are you free? -Yes, go ahead. Alex! -Did you find the papers? -Yes, but so did Anne. -Tell me you're joking. -I'm not joking. -What have I done? -It can't be that bad. You don't know Anne! This is terrible. I cheated on Anne! With Mikaela. It was a sex trap. I didn't want to. It was all her doing. -And yours! -Mine? You knew what Gothenburg parties are like and how fragile I was! -I'm bitterly disappointed in you! -Okay... Then let me apologize for your infidelity and give you a suggestion. You really want to be with Anne, right? I know that. Marry her. Propose. What are you saying? Should I propose out of the blue? Göran, you're right. I'll do it, damn it. -I'll propose to Anne. Thank you! -Good. -Ring! -I'll ring later. No, I don't have a ring. Right. Here you go. It's real and it has a story behind it. -It's a bit discolored. -Not for what it's been through. Thank you. Göran, you're my best friend. To Gärdet! -Sorry. -Seriously, Göran. -Hans is waiting for you. -Good. Where have you been? I've been here 8 minutes already! I was picking up Nelson Mandela, but he missed the plane. That's so like an American. What a year we've had. Upward and onward. I love you all. I have a note here that says- -that Crown Princess Victoria and Nelson Mandela send their love. Thank you. Grynet, I was hoping we could have a talk. -I'm busy right now. -Here's the deal, I'm sorry. No, I made an error of judgment, and I'm sorry. -Could we just talk? -It's my last day here anyway. -But I'm happy about yesterday! -You got to fly in a helicopter. You know what? My life isn't super easy. A weirdo with tics might just have to work harder than others. I'm used to people finding me strange. But not right after what felt like something good. Maybe that makes me extra sensitive... ...to being called insane. -Göran. -Hi. -I understand. -It's too bad. Too bad that you were just a non-confrontational clown. -What the hell? -It's okay, Niklas. -Let's not miss the boat. -Where are you going? -Möja. And...? -That was all. -Göran, did you check the weather? -We're inside, you know. Look out! It's taking off! -Not really according to plan, is it? -To focus on the positive side... Göran! - Here's the man himself. Explain to Greger why this happened. We're intrigued. We're a crappy event organizer. We can't tell our dumb customers neither Mandela nor Churchill- -will show up at their lame kickoffs no one cares about! And it's great to see you really personify what bad leadership is! And with those words I thank the Event Factory. Thank you. What a guy! He's awesome. Göran? She said yes. -She said yes! -Who? Grynet? No, Anne. It's crazy! Five minutes later, her boss calls and says she did great in Germany. -We're just so happy! -Congratulations, Alex. Congratulations to Anne and Germany. -How are things with Linnea? -I'm in love with Grynet. -Are you joking? -No. -Get your act together. -Exactly. I'm going to see her in Möja. -Is she in love with you? -Grynet? No, she hates me. I see. Now it makes sense. Hello? What the hell are you doing here? -I'd like to see Grynet. Is she here? -No. What do you want? What I want? Could you tell her something for me? It may sound weird, but I'd like to spend the rest of my life with her. -What are you saying? -Could you tell her I quit my job? -Go away! -Or tell her that I love her. -Get out! -We're already outside. The number you are trying to reach is not available. Please try later. Alex! -Grynet! -What are you doing? Sorry, I was wrong. The number is no longer in service. Here's that fun guy. Hi, welcome. Hello there. Hi. - Hello. -Hi, Göran. -Sophia... How are you doing? Not too well, from what I've heard. Well, it's alright. So, swallowed any rings lately? That's not funny. A woman in Denmark choked to death on a ring. -I hadn't heard about that. -No. But things are great. New boyfriend, who I think might be the one. He's just such a...man. It's nice when they are. I'm the bridesmaid, I mean best...maid. Man! -We'll talk more later! -Yes! Do you, Alexander Ahl, take Anne von Sivers to be your wife? -For richer or poorer? -I do. Time for the ring. I thereby declare you husband and wife. You may kiss each other. And so, we see for the first time- -Alexander Ahl and Anne Ahl... Anne...Ahl. Dear bride and groom. Marriage is like a long sailing trip- -on the stormy seas of life. There's so much joy and love in the air tonight that I'm moved. Now when Alex is your King! Alex and Anne, congratulations on your wedding day. Will you be happy? Well, that's hard to tell, we'll see. But you know each other well, which can be useful. If you think Alex respects Anne- -the way Tumnus the Fawn respected the Ice Queen in Narnia- -I can tell you that it doesn't matter. And if you think Anne respects Alex about as much as a bag of chips- -all I have to say is, "So what?". Alex wants to be Anne's chips. Ruffled and salty, and available on Friday nights. That's the life he's chosen, and he's the man Anne has chosen. You're a match made in Heaven, and now joined until you get there. A toast! Great speech. Did you spend time rehearsing it? Thank you. Not really, could you tell? -It's nice here. -Have you met my new boyfriend? Or...my boyfriend. Sorry, Niklas. Is he your boyfriend? - So you're dating Sophia? I see. That's great! Congratulations! What a couple! That makes me so happy! Congratulations! -Where's Grynet? -I think she left. Grynet! Are you drunk, or do you behave this way at sea too? I just wanted to thank you for coming and wave goodbye. Thank you. It was nice. One more thing, that charts and tables joke was very funny. Thank you. Bye. You're not good with car brands, are you? -Hello. -Hello. -Do you want something? -I've been thinking... Alex says that a relationship that's 80-85% right is acceptable. But I think it's not nearly enough. Not that it has to be 100%, that's probably impossible. I don't think anyone has that. -But more than 85%, maybe 90%. -That's just incredibly romantic. Grynet, I want to be with you not despite of how you are- -but precisely because of how you are. I love you unfathomably much. Is that correct? -So why is he so happy for us? -I don't know. Hey, what's with your tone?
