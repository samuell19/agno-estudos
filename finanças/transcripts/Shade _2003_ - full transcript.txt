# Don't know why # # there's no sun up in the sky # # stormy weather # # since me and that little girl # # ain't been together # # keeps on raining # # all the time # # life is bare... # Games of chance. Not the way we play. Seconds, centers, bottoms, stacking the deck, mucking cards... The tools and terms of the trade. But just having a pair of hands ain't enough. If you don't have the stones to move under fire, you'll never get the money. So you work in fast company, hone your chops, learn to deal with the unexpected. And that's how you become a pro. That's how you become the Dean. - Are we going to play some cards or what? - Everybody freeze! Don't anybody fucking move! Come on, get your hands up. Get 'em up. Put your fucking hands up! What the fuck is this, huh?! What is this?! What are you talking about? Huh?! You guys know who's running this game? Shut up, you fat fuck! Now get your money out. Get your fucking hands up! Look, I'm not going to do anything, okay? Get 'em up now! Okay. The appropriate term here is... Fucked. You mother... - Fill it up, please. - Yes, ma'am. Oh, shit! Are you all right? I just took my ring off in the washroom and dropped it. If you or anybody else finds this ring... Actually it was really expensive... Whoever finds it, I'll pay him a $1000 reward. Hey! Yo! Why don't I give you $100 for it? This ring is worth more than $100. Don't waste my time. Well, how much you want for it? 260, 280, 300. Come on, baby. How much you get? Let's go. Charlie, here's your money. Plenty there, all right? About fucking time, homer. Hey, Charlie, van morrison, Vegas. Van morrison, count me in. Hey. Hey, Vespa, Toni. Hey there. Hey, Cody, how are you, man? Hey, hey, hey. That's enough of that. - Hey, Charlie. - How are you, baby? - Charlie. - Carl, good to see you, man. Club. Jack of clubs, nine of hearts, eight of spades. All in. I call. All bets are in, gentlemen. On their backs. Three nines, pair of kings. Turn. Ouch. - Oh, God, that's gotta hurt. - Three kings. Baby, you're a 10, but I really need a nine. I'm out. That's how we do. Oh, this is great. Baby, you are a 10. I know you thought I was bullshitting. High five. - Hey, Larry. - Hey, baby. - How you doing? - I'm handling mine, taking all of this. - Mm-hmm. Big man. - Yeah. Yeah, you bet your ponytail. You know, Miller's here. Who's that? Come on, Miller, the guy I was telling you about. So Larry, this is Charlie Miller. Miller, this is the Jennings, Larry Jennings. Larry, that was pretty hot shit downstairs. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, it was all right. T. Tells me that you play pretty good yourself. Now and again, yeah. Yeah, right. - Can I get you some drinks, guys? - Yeah, I'll take a refill. Okay. Charlie, you still jd on the rocks? - In a bucket, baby. - You got it. So Larry, what do you know so far? What I do know is that you and your partner found some seats at a soft game and you guys have been doing pretty good on the regular. Yeah, that's right. It's taken quite a while to set it up, but it's beginning to pay off. Yeah, it's worth it. 10 to 20,000 a game. 10, 20 thou? That's nice. We could be doing a hell of a lot better, you know? If we had a third player, we'd tear this game apart. You're making money already. How did I become the lucky guy? It's pretty obvious that you can handle yourself well in a game. And Tiffany says you're cool, so... Can I get you a drink? Well, uh... Can I get you some of me? Original. No, actually. I'm Jeff. Go away, Jeff. W-whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going? My God! Hey, listen, get out of my face, Jeff, or I will gladly shove my heel down your throat. I like the sound of that. - Really? - Mm-hmm. You stay here and think about that, Jeff, while I walk away. Well, consider me interested. You got to raise at least 15 to 20,000. 15, 20... what, you want me to give you the money? What, you trying to pimp me now? It's the stake we all put in. It's a cash only game. You need the playing money. Come on, baby, I thought you'd be interested in this. Charlie's come all the way down here. But it's okay, maybe he's just not... I know Charlie came all the way down here. The money is no problem. The point is, I don't know him, he doesn't know me, and I don't want to be wearing a thong at the end of the day. For fuck's sakes, we're going to be giving you the money, not the other way around. This is a hell of an opportunity, Larry. What about the third musketeer? When do I meet him? - Ohh! - Ooh. Come on, let's go. I'm not feeling real well. - Jesus! - Fuck! Watch where you're going, bitch! Who are you calling bitch, cocksucker? - Oh! - Play nice, play nice! Get away from me! - Over here. - Fuck that! Fuck you, bitch! Fucking bitch! Fuck, she fucking ruined it! Take 'em away from me, all right? Give me a napkin, will you? Fuck! Jesus! - You okay there, miss? - Oh, fine. - You, sir, how you doing? - Yeah, I'm fine. Aside from being down 20 grand, I'm just great. Any chance of raising the limit on this table... To be five grand a hand? Let me see what I can do. What the fuck are you looking at? Your tits. Yeah. He wants to raise the table limit to five gs a hand. He's on a fresh shoot. Fade him. It's done. Five a hand. Great. Damn nice of you. Yes! Dealer busts. Tearing me apart over there. Good work, ladies. 40 gs for a half hour's work. Not bad. You bet. There's your cut. You sure you don't want to reconsider Reno? Oh yeah, I'm sure. Besides, Jackie's good enough to pull it off. Good enough for Reno, anyway. I'm almost out of beer. You got something set up? Who, me? Great. I'll be in town later this evening. Okay, see you then. Thanks. God, I wish the mob still ran this town. So do I. This is a hell of an opportunity, Larry. So what about the third musketeer? When do I meet him? You can meet him anytime you want. You can meet him now if you like. So how do we know this is going to pay off? Listen, come to this address in an hour. Go to the back room, ask for me. I'll be there with my partner. If the cards come funny to all of us, how you gonna fix that? Yeah, look, lady luck can be a bitch at times. But fortunately, the guy we're going to meet... My partner, he's a... Larry, do you know what a "mechanic" is? Christ, I can see debris from here. I'm not even dealing deuces, asshole. Pretty ugly-looking taps then. Maybe the chaps are getting rusty. Is that so? Big slick in clubs. Two-handed. Pretty good. That'd get the money. Yeah, but I always preferred American airlines myself. Son of a bitch. Well, good to see you're keeping the hands in shape. It's a hard habit to break. So what happened, Vernon? You disappeared like a fucking ghost after the Ross game. I just needed to get away for a while. - Oh, yeah? - Mmm. Well, for what it's worth, Tiffany and I were... We were worried about you. We thought you'd gone South because you'd taken some heat. It wasn't the cool thing to do. Yeah, well, neither was Atlantic city. So how is Tiffany? We're great. Very great. She is an amazing woman. - You know, I never thought... - What's the word on the game? Are we... Are we set? Yeah, I'm starting you at the game. Just got to get your head in the moment. That guy I was telling you about, he's coming here in a few minutes. I want you... Speak of the devil. That must be him. Hey! And the devil appears. Fuckin' a. Come on in. Yeah, I heard you were back in town. But you know what hurts me the most is, goddamn it, you didn't even call. It must've slipped my mind. What the fuck do you want, scarne? What the fuck you think I want? You know, we're kind of in between jobs at the moment. Why don't you come back in a couple of weeks and we'll see what we can do? Okay! Okay! I'll tell you what, can we make that on a... Ah, come on. Jesus, come on, scarne, you don't have to do that. See what you made me do? We don't have anything going on right now, okay? Bullshit. If you didn't have a line on something, you wouldn't be back here. He's telling you the truth. The only... Hold it. When I want your opinion, I will dial your fucking asshole. I'm kind of tapped at the moment. All I got is a nickel on me. Jesus Christ. You weren't kidding, were you? We're in a recession, didn't you hear? Well, whatever. But just remember, boys, I want my cut. And I will get it one way... Or another. Uh, how's your... How's your leg, by the way? It still hurts when it rains. Son of a bitch. Do yourself a favor, scarne, keep to extortion and leave the real work to the pros. Pros. Hear Skinner got... Got run over by a car? Yeah, yeah. Unsolved hit and run. Real tragedy. To protect and serve, huh? Fuck off. Some things never change, huh? You're going to dial your asshole. Oh, shit. Who is it? Jennings. This is the guys t. Was telling you about. She says you know your way around a game. Just got lucky. So Miller says that... You're the real deal holyfield with the cards. I can handle a deck pretty well. What is this, modesty night? Show him something. Four aces. That's kind of dope. I told you he was good. He's a goddamn artist. So you know the situation... We need a third to take down some of the big pots. If the same man keeps winning, it arouses suspicion. It's a big game. Soft game. Guys go all their lives trying to get into a game like this. So we've got to be really careful how we handle it. We need a top notch man. Uh-huh. So what you want me to do? You play on the square during most of the game, except on my deal. Like your hand? Get the fuck out of here with that Copperfield shit. Yeah, I like my hand. That's what's known as base or bottom dealing. But I will vary it by stacking as well and dealing the punch, whatever it takes. But don't worry. You'll end up a winner every time. Oh. So are you our man? I'm gonna fuck with y'all. - Great. - For sure. We'll give you most of the stake, so don't go blowing it on a hunch. Just save it for the sure thing on my deal, okay? Here's five, 10 grand. With your 15 that's 25. That gives us enough money to play. But you are going to be the one making the big bets. You are the one going to be taking down the big pots. Okay? I'm good with that. I like big shit. Show me the shit. Well, I think we're all here now. You all know Mr. Charlie Miller. - Hey, Charlie. - And this is Mr. Jennings, who will be joining us tonight. Would you sit there, Mr. Jennings, please? Thank you. This is Mr. Andrews, and Mr. ose, Mr. leipzig, Charlie of course you know, Dr. Daley and Mr. Vernon. - Good to meet you. - Call me Larry. Mr. Jennings, we play regular poker here. Stud, draw, lowball, dealer's choice, no limit. And of course, I take a small percentage for the house. Yeah. Have a wonderful game, all of you, and good luck. - Thank you. - Thank you. Okay, high card gets to deal. Good luck, everyone. You get the ace. It's your call. Let's ante up, gentlemen. Nothing fancy, nothing wild, just pray for cards that make you smile. Corny corn. Baddest guitarist in a white band, ace freely. Three aces. Yeah, I know you're in for that $25. Gonna put your kids through school, grade school? Look. Nice-ass house, man. We should be playing some bigger hands. Know what I'm saying? Are we men, or... What's going on? I done came all the way up here. Got my suit on and everything. What's with the arcade money? We gonna throw some logs on the fire and let it blaze a little bit? Ace bets. I'm going to get it cracking already. Let's pop this cherry. Shall we fellas? Can we do this? - Go ahead. - Can we do this? $500. - Oh. - Spend some of that hmo money. I'm out. - Too rich. - Too rich? - I'm out. - I'm in. My man. - Are you out? - Out. Then stay out. Me and my man will do it. Mmm, holler back. You know what I'm gonna do? Since I done already popped the cherry, I'm gonna take her out for a date. 2000 right there. Now what? Huh? Take it. - Take what? - Take it. Y'all got to be bullshitting with this. I spend more than this in a strip club. - You want to tell me how to play cards? - I'm not trying... - you want my chips, too? - I would like to get some of those chips. I can't get 'em unless you put 'em on the table. - Get a drink around here? - A drink? Shit, what is these chips, potato chips? Shit, come on, man, this is poker. $200. Somebody bounce with me. - I'm out. - I'm out. - You pushed me out. - Fuck. - I'm out. - Me too. You folding too. I'm with you, bro'. Let's keep it black. It's 200. I'll raise you 200 more. That's for Jesse. "Keep hope alive." I'm going. Okay, I'm gonna keep it black like my ass, and I'm gonna raise you three grand. Check your rent money. What's your wangdang look like? - Hmm? Come on, black. - Too rich for my blood, bro'. Fuck on, man, this is supposed to be a big game. We're supposed to be playing some big money. What is this? G-15, bingo! You all playing bingo in this bitch, 'cause you ain't spending no money. This is bullshit. I can't believe this. I think it's time we took a little break, gentlemen. Sounds good to me. Got some kool-aid in this motherfucker? Where'd you get this big man? Let's just take a break. I thought we had a civilized game. Everybody calm down. I can't believe this. $5, $10. You want to tell people how to play poker, maybe you could open a school. I can tell you about the hair on your chest. Are you cool? No, I ain't cool. Five hands, I'm only up a few hundred dollars? Fuck it, man. It's not an exact science. You just have to wait for the right time. Fuck that. This is wasting my time. I could do better by myself. Relax, will you? You cannot control how the other players bet. You just gotta wait your time, be patient. It'll pay off, I promise you. Yeah, it better. Five card draw, nothing's wild. Drinks, gentlemen? We don't need no drinks. We just need to play. - Let's get it cracking. - Let's do that. Good? Looking good already. All right, let's start with 100. Your hundred, and 200 more. 300 to me. Let's do three more. Six to me. Make it four more for an even grand. How about that? - I'm out. - Going, huh? Little thick? I'll see your grand, and I'll raise you two granddaddies... that's 2000. Holler back. I'm out. The man with style is a man that can smile. - I'm out. - You should come out with a rap album. Two grand to me. I'm gonna take a look at my cards. Call that. I think I'll follow your lead. Cards, fellas? Two please. - Two. - Just give me one, man. One card like my bitch. The dealer takes one. All right, holler back. Two grand again. I'm out. Come on, brother. Nothing, huh? Well, what the hell? It feels about like it's 12 gs. All right, well... Whoo, it's getting hot. Hot in here. Let's say... Five grand more? Well... I assume cash is acceptable, right? Of course. - 'Cause I happen to have a little bit on me. Jesus Christ. Shit! That calls your bluff right there. That's $82,500. No limit, right? This son of a bitch gonna buy it. Oh, it's bought. Excuse... excuse... Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Jennings. - Is my marker good here? - Of course. Hell no. What the fuck is that? I'm American express up in here? What the fuck is this mark shit? If you don't have the chips... Excuse me, but I have the money. I just don't have it on me. I got a jet, I just didn't fly here. Mr. Jennings, I can assure you that he has plenty of money, and he always pays his debts. Now his marker is good at this table. You are called. Fuck it, it don't matter. I've only had four girlfriends in my life, and they was all 10s. Shit. You motherfuckers. Excuse me. I guess every one of those girls was fucking a guy named Jack. Take a look. No, that's not... Possible. Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Let me explain. What I'm saying is, look, this money is not the money that I'm trying to bet with. - Let me give you an iou. - A little cab fare, there you go. Dina, can't you take his iou? The cash right here is not the money I'm supp... Supposed... Miss whatever your name is... Look, my man, let me get you an iou. What were you thinking, Larry? You were told just to bet on Vernon's deal, right? I know, I know. And what's with pulling out the big bankroll? Because I had a four of a kind. Shit. Okay, just relax, man. Relax. You know what? We're going to get those sons of bitches the next time. But you've got to start listening to me. You got to start getting with the program, Larry. You don't... You don't understand. Shit! Listen, if you're short of some cash, I can lend you a couple hundred. A few hundred dollars ain't gonna do nothing for me. That just went swimmingly. Were we not clear, Larry? Only bet heavy on my deal. That way I can control the outcome. You know, cheat. Man, I don't want to hear this shit right now. - Fuck! - Larry... Larry, listen. This is just a bump in the road. We're going to get this back tenfold. Only if Nick the Greek here learns to control himself. Would you leave him alone? Leave him alone. - Relax. - Fuck! You'll get back twice what you lost in a couple of weeks. - I swear to you. - I don't have a couple of weeks. Damn! Motherfuckers ain't hearing what I'm saying? Shit. - Hey, Larry. - Don't give me that shit right now. Nice to see you, too. What the hell was that about? He had a... A really bad night. Fuck it. To your health. I wish that you could've joined me. They do a lovely lichee-nut Martini here. Respect. I think respect is one of the Paramount tenets of human relations. It says in the Bible, "thou shalt respect thy mother and thy father." I respect Mr. malini. He has respected me as a father respects his son. We've respected you. But frankly you've disappointed us. Hello, Nate. Would you care for something to eat? No, thanks. You see my friend here, he probably prefers a double king chili cheese with an egg on it. And a shake. And I respect that. Oh, excuse me. I'm vibrating. Hello, marlo. Yes? Information? Who is this? Is that so? I'll do that. Who is this? They hung up. No respect. You're hitting the hard stuff kind of early, aren't you? What the fuck y'all want? Mr. malini would like to have a word with you. Right now? Patience isn't one of his virtues. Larry, I understand you're a very good card player. Yeah, I mess around a little bit. - Do you? - Yeah. Pick up the motherfucking phone. I heard you're quite a brilliant poker player. Well, if that's what they say, then that's what it is. How's it going? It's got its ups and downs. That's how it goes. - Ups and downs? - Yeah. You know, I'm not much of a card player, but would you say that losing 80,000 U.S. dollars is a down? Yeah, that's... Fuck! Yeah, that's a down. And would it be a down if I lost that 80,000 out of last week's take? I said it would be a down, man. If you already know, you know. What's with the silly questions? Did you really think you could lose 80,000 of Max's money and he'd not find out about it in this town? I'm gonna square that away with Max. How could you be so fucking stupid, Larry? I'm in it with these guys, one guy can do anything with a deck of cards. They take me to this game. We're supposed to win it. I get carried away on this one had and I... I shouldn't have bet on it, and I lost. I can't blame nobody but myself. I just... I didn't do what they said to do. Did it ever occur to you that you were the one hustled, Larry? That your so-called partners were professional grifters? They were con men? No, no, no, because they lost their money, too. Well, I think we're all here. This is... Boy reaches for his stash and I thought I was going to shit. - Hey, baby. - Do you like that? Hey, I told you it would feel good. The whole thing was a setup. I got 60 even. You believe me now, Larry? They had... A buffet. Beautiful jacket. Always a pleasure. Son of a bitch never knew what hit him. Five card draw. Nothing's wild. - Work of art. - Drinks, gentlemen? No, we don't need no drinks. We just need to play. Francis brought in the drinks as Jack brought in the cooler. Cooler on his own deal. It is good to be back. It's certainly turning out to be profitable. I've got to say, you sure know how to pick 'em, baby. That's what I'm here for. This is a hell of an opportunity, Larry. So when do I meet the third musketeer? Anytime you want. You can meet him now, if you like. Yeah. I'm gonna go cash out. I'll call you later. He's pretty good. Where'd you get him? A couple of weeks ago at another club. Y'all count 'em. He had the rolex, he had a brand new lexus. He's made for it. I've always said it, baby... You are the best. Have you seen Vernon yet? I'm seeing him later on tonight. How is he? You know Vernon. Vernon's Vernon. - You know how he is. - Yeah. What are you doing? You've got one lit already. Listen, if... If working with Vernon is going to be a problem... What? Come on, Charlie... Don't worry about me. It's me. Got it. I'll meet you there. Well, well, well. Looks like you're all alone now, huh? Lucky me. Who is that? None of your fucking business, that's who. Do you know what a "mechanic" is, Larry? So were you serious before? Is that your scene? Scene? Yeah, or were you just talking shit trying to get laid? Oh, I'm... I'm into it, mate. Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Come on, Jeff. Okay, so what about a safe word? What? You know, in case one of us feels we're going too far. Okay, how about... "Eclipse"? Either one of use feels uncomfortable, we say eclipse, we take a time out. Sure, baby, whatever you want. So how do you like it, Jeff? Rough. Hey, Tiffany, how are ya? Hey, Teddy, I'm good. How's your family? Oh, they're great... Great, thanks. Say, it surprised me a little to get that telephone call. I didn't know you still did this. - Yeah, well, I needed some fast cash, you know? - On the road with Miller? Something like that. What did you say? I can't hear you with that thing in your mouth. Eclipse. Rough enough for you, baby? I've got to say, you sure know how to pick 'em, baby. That's what I'm here for. So you think Jennings will be back for more? Fish like that always come back. - I wouldn't be so sure. - No? Why not? Jennings, he seemed... Something was off. He just dropped his entire life's savings in one hand. Tends to wig a guy out. - No, it was more than that. - Fuck him. You know that's a trait you're going to have to get rid of... Feeling sorry for the mark. The way I look at it, guy isn't smart enough to hold on to his money, he doesn't deserve to have it. Right, baby? - You said it. - See? She understands. Let's go get a drink. Come on. Let's go. The suspense is killing me. What's the word on the game? Is he sitting? Yeah, he's in. Holy shit. Come on, guys, who? Dean fucking Stevens, that's who. "Dad" Stevens. The man himself. I mean, this guy, he's a legend. He was younger than I was when he started playing the big time. Big time? This guy sat down with gangsters, fucking killers, mobsters. Not for the money... - no, no, just to hone his chops. I guess that would do it. There was one night in Philadelphia, all these mobsters sitting around a table, he's working the game when out of nowhere, bang... - Everybody freeze! - ...The place gets hit. Everyone's got their hands in the air. - What is this? - Everyone but Stevens. As luck would have it, he'd just gone South and was holding out. Well, the place explodes. A huge gunfight and everyone but Stevens and one of the wise guys go down. Stevens and the other guy, they end up in a standoff. Yeah, and they had three choices... Start shooting, walk away and leave the money... ...or three? We cut for it. High card takes it all. I know which I prefer. Nothing ventured... Nothing gained. He walked away with 50 grand, not even a scratch. Wow. Maybe it's just a fucking myth. Maybe Stevens made the whole thing up. It's a great fucking story, though. Yeah. There are guys that'll drop their entire bankroll just to say they sat at the same table as him. The Dean. - So will you be staying with us very long? - Just a few days. - Business or pleasure? - Business. Whoever takes the Dean becomes the Dean. Well, he's never been taken. Not yet. Don't' get so cocky. I don't want a repeat of Atlantic city. Yeah, well, neither do I. Well, I'll be damned. Good to see you, Eve. It's good to see you, too. Frank... It has been a while, hasn't it? Yeah, it's been a while. You look good. I do, don't I? You don't look so bad yourself. Nice place you got here. Yeah, a lot of work. You should have seen it when I first got it. So... So. I was just in town for this game and I thought I'd... You hungry? Famished. So you saw Stevens play, right? Oh, I sure did. Omaha, Nebraska, 24th of may, 1986. I'll never forget it. I saw him gut a mob that tried to set him up, and he did it in such a way that it was a thing of beauty. I will never forget it as long as I live. Quit trying to scare me. I'm not trying to scare you. I'm just trying to prepare you. This isn't some whale who sits down beside you and says, "here, please, take my money." This guy can cut you into little pieces, you won't even know it. So are you... Are you happy? Sure... I mean, sometimes. You know, that's life. Well, it looks like things are really working out for you. You never know what's going to happen to somebody once they get off the grift. But I'm happy for you, really. Thanks. No husband or kids? God... no. - Not for a lack of opportunities, though. - Of course. I guess you're a tough act to follow. When you have your life's savings riding on the turn of a card every other night, then paying a mortgage can seem rather mundane. Yeah, I guess. What? Lately I've been thinking that worrying about paying a mortgage might not be such a bad thing. - Oh, come on. - No, I'm serious. More and more it's starting to feel like work. I know the feeling. I'm starting to feel like this old gunfighter. Like every game I go to, every town, there's always some kid who's dreaming about knocking off the Dean. And I used to love it, 'cause everybody wanted a piece of me, sitting around that table and knowing that no one could even touch me. But these last couple of years, I'm just going through the motions, getting lazy, not caring. I'm losing my edge. So I say to myself, maybe I oughta retire, go out gracefully, before some kid comes along and just rips me apart. One small problem... we need 250 to get into the game. - Whew, man, that's quite a stake. - Prime rib. The way I figure it is this... Six, seven, 'round the table, the pot's two million at least, just for starters. - I've got 100 grand. - I don't know. You really think you can take Stevens? The Dean retire? That would be a first. I don't know, seeing how well you've done just gets me thinking. Thinking can get you in trouble. Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. So are you a restauranteur now? Well, I'm still trying to figure that one out. Do you think a happy restauranteur could be... Happy with a retired card man? Well, I'll let you know when I meet one. Maybe we should meet again tomorrow night. Maybe we should. Come to the game. "Come to the game, Eve." I might be able to come by when I close up. I'd like that. I always did love to watch you play. But the best mechanic doesn't always win the game. Don't worry. This time I'll be patient. I'll wait for the right moment. And when he makes his move, I'll gut the son of a bitch in one hand. That's what I like to hear. Okay, I'm in. But I am coming to this game. I've got to watch over my investment. Well, this puts us over the top. I guess I'll go make that phone call, tell them we're in the game. You know what's really cool? We're back together again. The old team, just like the old days. It's good to have you back, kid. It is, you know. Is what? Good to have you back. I'm not back. I'm just here for the game. All right. So how's working single o? It's fine. It must be sort of limiting though, huh? Yeah, but it's got its advantages. - Oh yeah? - Mm-hmm. I don't have to worry about your partner stabbing me in the back. Or waking up with a kidney missing. Tell Charlie I'll see you guys tomorrow. Shit! Do not sneak up on me like that. Oh God. Are you okay? Yeah, just checking my messages. So where did Vernon go? I don't know. He split. What do you want? I need to talk. - Now? - Yeah, now. Such a moody guy, that Vernon. Tell me about it. Listen, now that he's back, there's a couple of things I want to talk to you about. Oh, Charlie, I'm beat. Thanks. I wanted to explain about Atlantic city. I don't need an explanation. Well, I need to. I didn't mean for it to happen. I don't see the point. Once the game is over, I'm out of here and you and Charlie can go back to whatever it is you have going on. There is nothing going on. We're just partners. Last time I saw you two, it appeared a lot different than just being partners. - It doesn't mean anything. - Tell that to Charlie. - I was just frustrated. - Yeah, I can see how frustrated you are. Come on, t., nothing with you ever just happens. I don't know what your angle was, but I wasn't going to stick around and find out. There wasn't any angle. I just made a mistake. I mean, you just took all that cash. I had a right to be pissed and upset. Charlie was just there saying all the right things. I should never have fallen in love with you. You had me feeling like a mark. How can you say that? You were the only one I didn't have to play a role with. I miss that. I miss it too. So what are we going to do about it? We're not going to do anything about it. I'm not going to hurt Charlie. You mean, like the way he hurt you? I thought you quit. Yeah, well... You, smoking, all my old vices are becoming versas. Oh good. Listen now, can you do me a favor? Can you come by tomorrow around 2:00? There's a couple of things I want to talk to you about. You know, personal, just you and me. Sure. I'll see you then. Mm-hmm. These motherfuckers set me up, all right? That bitch had something to do with it. These motherfuckers... I usually don't work like that. I usually work by myself... Should've been by myself. They disrespected me in doing that. They disrespected Max. They disrespected everybody. Max is looking at me now like it's some fucked up shit. Like I would really steal from Max. Max is my dawg, man. You know what I'm saying? I couldn't believe I didn't see it coming, but I had a great hand, and then I didn't have a great hand. Motherfuckers, they... motherfuckers is good... they good. I'm going to take care of a couple things. I'll be right back. Don't worry. Yeah, sure, sure. Take care of that. Oh, fuck. Shit! Hi, I'm looking for a Mr. Miller, a Mr. Charlie Miller. Do you know him? You're kidding me, right? The corner booth. I just needed change for the condom dispenser. Thank you. Take a seat. Are you Charlie Miller? Charlie Miller? I know who you're talking about. Cool guy, kind of handsome. You want to get a message to him? I'll take that as a yes. God, I'm hungry. I've got to watch the cholesterol, though. You want to split a chicken Caesar? I have some important information for you, Mr. Miller, which may be of interest to you. You're not one of those Jesus guys, are you? Because it's not for me. You're in way over your head, Mr. Miller, and you don't even know it. Is that so? You and your crew knocked off someone last night for 80 large. Don't worry, it doesn't matter to me how a man makes his living. Schmuck probably had it coming to him. It would be of no concern to me except that the 80 grand he lost was not his. It was his employer's. And his employer is a man by the name of Mr. malini. Does that name sound familiar to you, Mr. Miller? "Malini." Yeah, it rings a bell, yeah. Then now, perhaps, you realize the situation in which you find yourself. Listen, I don't know who the fuck you are, but let's just take a couple of seconds here to pretend I know what you're talking about. I ain't dumb enough to play with mobbed-up money. No, not on purpose, no. But you see the problem, it still remains. The money, Mr. Miller... Do you still have it? No, I don't. It's all been divided up. And how much do you have? Well, not much. I... Had some expenses. It's unfortunate. Yeah, I'm beginning to feel that might be the case. And what about your crew... And Vernon? Listen, that 80 gs... No sweat to get it back. In fact, why don't you tell Mr. malini this... Tell him to consider it in the context of a loan and I'll keep the juice going, give him an extra 20,000. Let's say, I'll have 100 grand in a couple of days. - Two days? - Two days. - 100 grand. - Mm-hmm. So you already have your mark set up? Yeah, no sweat. No sweat. Hmm. I'll make sure that I get the message out. You do that. - Oh, and one more thing. - Oh, yeah, what's that? Give up smoking. It takes years off your life. You know, it's funny you should say that because I've been... Hey, Charlie. Fuck! Stained the fucking suit! Fuck. Vernon, come on! Come on, Charlie! What the fuck was that about?! Who were those guys?! Muscle... Muscle for malini. - Malini? - Yeah. Obviously Jennings was working for malini. It wasn't his money to lose. You think? Fuck! You were supposed to check him out. Oh, come on, Charlie. I knew he was connected, but not connected. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Okay, okay, calm down. Good timing, t., saved our asses in there. We just have to figure out what to do next, that's all. It's time to get the hell out of dodge. - After the game. - What? - After the game. - Are you insane?! Malini's connected all over L.A., Vernon. It's highway time. We haven't gone through all of this not to play in that fucking game. I'm playing in that game. - You want to split? Feel free. - Shut up! Malini's never going to find us that fast. All we got to do is lay low for a bit, that's all. Where? Let's get cleaned up. I know a place no one will look. Open sesame. - You're kidding. - No shit. It's the magic castle, what do you want? There's no way malini's going to find us in this place. It's kind of amazing. Yeah, I used to spend a lot of time here before I met Charlie. Before I rescued you, you mean. You okay? Well, yeah, other than being shot at, I'm great. No, I mean, between you and me, are we okay? Yeah. Yeah, we're fine. Look, after the game, I'll talk to Charlie, okay? We'll work it out. What the hell's vice doing here? You run out of hookers to bust? Yeah, I... I think the last one I busted was your mama. Of course, don't worry, she's out on bail. - So who's this guy? - Not sure yet. We think he's connected to malini's crew. Witnesses? The waitress in back. She didn't see anything. People outside said they saw three people tear ass out of here just afterwards. Two guys and a girl. Two guys and a girl? Jesus, I don't believe it. - What? - Look. What the fuck is he still doing here? - Who? - Professor. Put the cards down. Just put them down. Jesus, you have no idea what you're doing. That's horrible. Absolutely horrid. Go read eardonachs. But I didn't get... - no, no, it actually hurts me to watch you hold a deck. I suggest taking up a new hobby like stamp collecting. So Professor, what is the best advice you've ever given a card man? Sleep with as many different women as possible. Hey, guys, what do you think of this? Not bad. Not bad. What do you think, Vernon? Well, the move is pretty open. It'll work here, but forget about it at the card table. You need some kind of shade. I'd say make the shift with one hand as you ante with the other. That's good. Very good. Boys, I'd like you to meet one hell of a card man. - This is Vernon. - Hey. Hey. Professor, this is Tiffany. If I knew that hustling had such benefits, I never would have gotten into magic. Why thank you. - And you remember, uh... - Miller! Surprised you're still alive. Funny, I could've said the same thing about you. You still hustling old ladies out of their social security checks? Still pulling rabbits out of hats, Professor? Boys, entertain the lovely lady while Vernon buys me a drink. Just don't pull any rabbits out of your hats. - Been a while. - Quite a few years. What brings you here? There's a big game at the Roosevelt tonight. You boys are going to work? Stevens is playing. - The Dean? - Yeah. Be careful, he's damn good. So are we. - Don't you mean he? - No, I mean we. Who do you think got your little magic boy here into someone who could make a real living? It hasn't hurt you at all, has it? Give us a minute, Charlie, will you? Look, there's some loose change over there on the floor. Keep an eye on the clock, okay? I want you to think of any card in any of the three rows. Okay. - You look a little haggard, son. - It's been a long week. Being on the grift is a tough life. It can wear you down. I've seen it before. I know, I know. You told me. I'm not knocking the profession, my boy. Hell, I've been friends with most of the top mechanics and hustlers of the last century. I just hate to see you go down that road, especially with Miller. - He's not that bad. - He's a street hustler... Who's glommed onto you because he sees you have talent and he has none... other than being a good liar. We made a good team. I mean, what did you want me to do? Make a grand or so a week doing tricks for tourists? I make that in one hand. Of course. You just have to make a choice. At some point, is it about the art, or the money? I remember when you and I used to stay up all night just discussing one move. Yeah, I miss that. I still don't have the finger floater on the bottom palm covered yet. We should work on that. You always know where to find me. Resident legend, huh? Ask yourself if this is what you want to be doing for the rest of your life. It gets harder every day and every dollar to get out. Just remember, some things are more important than money... Vernon. I've known a lot of mechanics and hustlers in my time, but I've yet to meet a retired one. Hello? They're using bee, red back. Nice work, J.J. I'm... I'm looking for Mr. Hemingway. Try room 808. Thank you. We're in. - How do you feel? - I'm good. I'm loose. Okay, remember what I said... Play the man, not just the cards. Take your time. Be patient. Quit it, Charlie. You're making me nervous. No, nerves are good. Keeps you sharp. Good. Ready to do this? Okay, let's go. Can I help you? I'm looking for Mr. Hemingway. Please come in. Hey, now you must be Mr. holden. That's right. How're you doing? - How do you do? - This is Miller. - How are you? - And this is Tiffany. A genuine pleasure, ma'am. - Thank you. - I'm Tony d. From Austin, Texas. This good old boy is Mr. thornhill. - Hey. - Call me Jack. Hey, Jack. And if you'll allow me to introduce you to our host this evening... Mr. malini. Good of you to join us, Mr. holden. It's good of you to have me. These are my friends. They tend to bring me luck. Any problem with them observing? Not at all. I hope this will prove to be an entertaining evening for all of us. If you'll allow me to introduce you to the other players? You didn't know malini was going to be here? No idea. - Great. - Stay cool. This is Mr. Stevens. Mr. Stevens... Mr. holden. - Nice to meet you. - And you. I hear you're from the Cincinnati area. Yeah, around there. Then you must know lady buck Johnson? I've met her. I don't really know her, though. Too bad about her husband, isn't it? I wasn't aware that she was ever married. Oh, that's right. I don't remember seeing you around the clubs the last time I was around Cincinnati. - I'm more or less a weekend player. - Right. This is Tiffany. Tiffany, very expensive name. Worth every penny. - This is Miller. - Charlie, Charlie Miller. Dean, good memory. You sitting in, Charlie? Not me, no. I'm a dice man. Really. Are you stake horsing? Well, yeah, I guess something like that, yeah. You must be pretty good, kid, if he's willing to risk money on you. Charlie's very conservative. You're not a hustler, are you, kid? What do you say, Max? Are we going to start this thing or what? Absolutely. Gentlemen. There you go. Can I get a receipt for that? Yeah, after the game, dice man. Mr. holden, take your seat over there. Feel free to reload at any point. If the Dean would do us the honor? Sure, Max. Texas hold 'em, straight up. Ante, gentlemen. Call. Ah, what the hell? 10 more. I'll just take one card, please. I'm out. I'm in for a thousand. 20 more. That's it for me. Out. - Well, Tony? - Yeah, yeah. Okay, heck yeah, I'll call you. Let's see what you got there, buddy. We got a big ouch. Heck yeah. I guess you won that one, too. Oh, yeah. Something says five more. Yeah, I'll raise you another 5000. My goodness, I'm getting weak at the knees. Let's see if I can dig down and get the courage to match that hefty wager. Stevens is going to go for the kill on Tony d. Why don't we make it... 50,000? That's 45,000 more. What do you think? Tony? Yes, um... I don't think I have that much... With me. Really, Tony, it's not that complicated. How much do you think you have, Tony... Anthony from Austin or whatever... In that little saddlebag that you brought with you? Well, let's see. Mm-hmm. I'm sure you got a few more nuggets in that bag. It appears I only have 25,000. Now I could be cruel, but you would think badly of me if I just bought the pot. So Tony, since you flew in and you look like a nice guy, I am going to accept that bet. So 25,000 it is to you. I'm... I'm awfully sorry. What? Oh, no. Easy, easy, cowboy. Back off, let's go. Bad manners, Tony. It appears my evening has drawn to an embarrassingly dramatic close. Gentlemen... Ma'am. Good night, Tony. Hundred thousand. I'm out. All in. I'll call. Trip 10s. - Sweet. - As pie. But I've got the nuts. - Ace high. - Son of a bitch! Some luck. So much for my lucky hat. Well, gentlemen, that's all for me. I think I'll call it a night as well. Gentlemen. Very impressive, kid. And then there was three. My lucky number. How about five-card stud from here on out? Music to my ears. Yeah, that sounds quaint. And how about a break? What, are you tired? Just distracted, Cleveland. - Cincinnati. - Sorry, same state. Back in 20 minutes, gentlemen. Man, am I glad you came by. Like I said, I always love to watch you play. - I like that. - How's it going? I'm doing the obnoxious bit with this kid. Nothing seems to rattle him. He's good. He's just very, very good. As good as you? Well, I didn't say that. Charlie, will you fix me a drink? - Mmm, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. You want me to get you a drink? Yeah, I'd love a drink. Keep your mind on the fuckin' game. Do you "folly"? Hey, count the chips on the table. - So how is he? - He's really good. I've double duped him a couple of times and he won't bite. - So what do you think? - I don't know. He's folded a few times with bad hands. It's like he's reading my cards. - So maybe he is. - Marked cards? Come on. The Dean's not going to use paper in a real game. That's just for hustles and squares. You don't use it in fast company. Maybe he doesn't consider you fast company. You know what? Let's find out. Come with me. I don't see any edgework, sandwork, no shade or flash, no block out or black line either. It's clean. - Son of a bitch. - What? It's juice. The bastard is using a juice deck. Juice deck? Yeah, look. It's a way of marking cards so you can only read it when your eyes are out of focus. Try it. Oh my God. Oh my God. I've only heard of juice decks. - So what now? - Now? I think the Dean is about to take a fall. I think I'll quit while I'm still behind. I guess it's just you and me, Cincinnati. So romantic. King speaks. 4,000. I like round numbers. Let's make it 10. King agrees. King says bet. 20. Make it 50. King likes that. Cowboy still thinks big. How's 100 grand sound? Two. Weekend player, huh? Last time I recall, ladies beat Jacks. If that's all I have. Well, let's find out. 300,000. Starting to feel like a healthy pot. 500,000. I'm all in. I'm short... 50 grand. - Really? - Mmm. Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. That's 3-0. 30. Here's 20 more. It's good to have friends. You bet. All the way. I'm looking for Mr. Hemingway. I don't know any Hemingway. Sorry. Oh. Now you listen to me, you son of a bitch, I'll squeeze your goddamn balls till you shit in your britches. Now where's the goddamn game? So let's see what you've got up your sleeve, kid. - Wait. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Come on. - These are the guys. - What? - What is this? That's Vernon, Miller... These are the guys who took Jennings for 80 g. I don't know you. - Hey! Hey! - Not so fast, slick. - Put down your gun. - You so much as move, your boss... - Drop the gun! - Fuck you! - You're Vernon? - Malini, tell 'em to drop 'em. - Drop it, sweetheart. - Fuck you, man! - Fuck you! - Drop the fucking gun! - Put the gun down. - Charlie, shut up! - Put it down! - You see what I'm fucking doing? - Be nice, lady. - You're the Vernon from Kansas City? What? - Put it down now! - Fuck you! Watch your language. Yeah? Eat my shit, asshole. Drop the fucking gun, bitch! - I heard a lot about you. - Thanks. - Fuck you! - Put down the gun. Malini, tell him to drop it! - I hear you've been looking for me. - Well... - I guess you found me. - Put it down! Goddamn it, Charlie! Hello. Yeah. No, I don't know anything about a fucking ring. Things okay at home, are they, Charlie? Who the fuck is this? Shit. Thank God, it's the police. - Who are you? - Who am I? - Who the fuck are you? - Great timing, scarne. - Another friend? - You have no idea. Max, why don't you tell your boys to relax? You can take care of him after the game. All right. Now I'm guessing that you and your friends are completely tapped out and I can buy this pot for say, $10. Don't bet on it, sweetheart. Tiff. Considering the circumstances, I'll let it pass. Let's see your card. Do it, Vernon. Yes. Trip Jacks. Hell of a hand, kid. You surprised? You could say that. I guess I always knew this day was gonna come. It just ain't today. Three ladies. No, no, no. That's not possible. Anything is possible. Tough break, kid. - What does that mean, Charlie? - We're fucked. What does that mean, Charlie? We're fucked. You're good, kid. Really, you're very, very good. But as long as I'm around, you're always gonna be second best. Jesus Christ. What did you do? Hey, you want to get that thing away from me, please? - You're making me nervous. - You're making me nervous, too. Not exactly a private place for murder. Put it away. Jennings was an idiot, anyway. I would, however, strongly suggest the three of you get out of the racket, 'cause if I see you again, I won't see you again. About my cut... Forget it. Forget about it. You know, this almost makes up for my leg. See you around... Pros. Nice play, Dean. - Here are your winnings. - Thanks. I'll let you know when we set another game, Dean. Sure, Max, but this is my last one for a while. - Eve. - Good night. Hey, always reject your hold cards. Hell, I was mucking cards before you were born. The Dean, huh? Oy. You know, it's probably none of my business... But Jennings never knew he was being conned. Shit. Someone must've tipped us off. - Who is this? - Seems one of your mules dropped 80 grand on a poker hustle tonight. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Hey, hey! One more thing, if you want the cash back, you might want to talk to a guy named... Charlie Miller. He'll be at a bar... Now.. Please, let us know if we can be of some assistance. You got a cigarette? Thanks. $2 million. I can't believe it. You let $2 million slip through your fingers. You fucked it. He outplayed me. Outplayed you? Look, Charlie I'll make it up to you, okay? The next time... There isn't gonna be a next time. Don't you get it? It's over. I wash my hands of you. So that's it? That's it. Come on, baby, just leave him. Well, this is familiar. Yeah, well, it's over. Oh, yeah, it's over, baby. Wait a minute. # Stormy weather # # since me and that little girl... # sir, I'm sorry, there's not supposed to be any smoking in here. Hell with it. Go ahead. Stupid-ass law anyway. Thanks. # Life is bare # # there's gloom and misery everywhere # # stormy weather # # since me and that little girl # # been together... # good work, kid. Everything except for malini. Oh hell, there's always complications. Dealing with it is what takes skill. Which reminds me, it was a good call bringing in scarne. - Nice work there, John. - My pleasure. Thanks for coming in, John. This actually does make up for my leg. Besides, I never liked Miller or that broad. Mean, mean... So did you get your answer, kid? Unfortunately, yes. Oh, come on, anybody can take a sucker. That's what they're built for. But to take down a pro... someone who's wise, your partner... Now that's a real score. There's nothing more satisfying than taking down your partner, especially when they deserve it. Yeah, that they definitely did. So you really out? Oh, hell yeah. Gotta go out sometime. - Might as well be while you're on top, right? - Right. What about you? You goin' back on the road? Nah, I don't know what I'm gonna do, but I'm finished for a while. It's too bad though. Oh, why's that? We never got to sit at a table for real. Yeah, that is a shame. I always wondered how it would turn out. I guess one of us would have lost. I guess so. See you around, Vernon. Hey, Vernon... See ya around, Dean.
