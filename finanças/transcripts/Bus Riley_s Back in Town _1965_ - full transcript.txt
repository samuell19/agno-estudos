(epic upbeat music) (drums rolling) (whimsical upbeat music) (door slamming) (whimsical upbeat music) (luggage thudding) (door slamming) (whimsical upbeat music) (upbeat suspenseful music) - (knocking) Hey, mom. Hey, I'm home. (whimsical upbeat music) (whimsical upbeat music continues) (whimsical upbeat music continues) (whimsical emotional music) (emotional music) (shoes clatter) (gentle music) (playful harmonica music) (playful music) (gentle dramatic music) - Bus. (laughs) - Huh? - Bus, it's me, Gussie. - I... - Hey. - Welcome home, Bus. - [Bus] Welcome home. - I'm so glad you're home. - Right. (Gussie laughs) (Bus groans) (Bus groans) (Bus groans) - Bus, I just wanted you to know how glad I am to see you. - [Bus] Morning. (playful music) (door clatters) (footsteps pattering) - Mom, Bus has got a tattoo. Did you see it? - I saw it. - Oh, it's wonderful to have a man in the house again. I get so tired of females. - A tattoo. - I don't know what possessed him to do such a childish thing. - It's on his arm. It's a bleeding heart. Oh, I love him. I wanna get one myself. - You? - Yeah. Can I, mom? Can I get a tattoo? - One tattoo in the family is enough. - What did he wanna get a tattoo for? - Because his heart was bleeding for Laurel Murdoch when he ran off and joined the Navy. - That'll do, Gussie. - All sailors have tattoos. - Bus got one because Laurel Murdoch wouldn't marry him. Bet you anything that's why he joined the Navy, isn't it? - No, he joined the Navy because he wanted to see the world. - I guess I just better be getting off to school now. That old principal gets mad as a hornet if all us teachers aren't there by 8:30. Oh, Gussie. Do you want a ride? - No. I don't like to get there that early. - Oh. Mrs. Riley. I don't know how I'm gonna like it here now. I mean, there's only one bathroom and I know how men can mess up a bathroom. (Gussie sputters) - Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way, Carlotta. - Well, I may decide to move. - Well, well, all I require is one month's notice. - I'll think about it. (footsteps pattering) - I bet most men are tidier in the bathroom than she is. Honestly, mom. She makes a mess out of everything. She's got her pants and her stockings up to dry. She washes her hair and doesn't even clean out the basin. - Okay. Paula, I'm eating my breakfast. (cutlery scraping) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (pillow thumping) - Oh, no! - Oh! (door clattering) - Oh. - Hi, Bus. - Hi. - When did you get home? - Last night. - You don't remember me. - Uh, Judy. - Right. - Yeah. - I've come by to pick us Gus. She ready to leave? - Oh, well no, she's eating. - I know. - Oh. - Can I come in? - Uh. (door clattering) - She, she's in the, in the kitchen. (door clatters) - So you got in last night. - Yeah. - You gonna stay around for a while, huh? - Oh, yeah. I'm out now. - Good. I, I guess I'll see you later, huh? - Uh-huh. - Bye. - Bye. (door clattering) - Ms. McLaney, what's the matter? - Oh, it's all right, dear. Don't touch me, dear. It's all right. I just have these little attacks once in a while. I'm just gonna be fine. I'll just be fine, dear. Thank you. (footsteps pattering) - See you in school. - Yeah. (door clatters and slams) - Morning, Mrs. Riley. - Morning, Judy. Sit down. I'll give you some pancakes. - Okay. Hi, Judy. - Hi. - Good morning, Judy. - Morning, Paula. - How's your mother? - Oh, she's all right. You know how mom is. (bell ringing) (Bus crashes) - Hey, Paula. (bell ringing) - Hey, Paula. Some jerk's blowing his horn for you. (door clatters and slams) - (laughs) That's Stu. I gotta go. - [Mrs. Riley] The neighbours are gonna ask us to move if he keeps that racket up every morning. - [Paula] I'll see you later. Bye-bye. (door clatters) Sorry if he woke you, Bus. (door slams) (bell ringing) (door slams) Be quiet, Stu. I'm here. - Hurry up. I've got a lab test in chemistry this morning, and I haven't cracked the book yet. (footsteps pattering) - You know, I don't see how any girl could turn down a guy like Bus. - The man she married has a lot of money. - Yeah, well what's money compared to Bus? - [Mrs. Riley] The sun doesn't rise and set on Bus Riley. - I think he's greater than (smacks) Rock Hudson, Gordon Cooper, Cary Grant (laughs) And George Maharis all rolled up into one. - Well, remember that he's human too. He has his faults. He's not Superman. - Of course, he's human. - Hey. (Gussie shrieks) (laughs) Oh, it's me. Hey. Hey, Gus. Hey. I give up. I can't sleep in this house. (lips smacking) Hey, mom. Will, you look at that. (whistles) You've grown into quite a girl, Gussie. Wow. - Am I as pretty as Paula? - Yeah, I think so. - Liar. - (laughs) Except Paula's still stuck on his up. I bet she is. She always was. - (grunts) Oh, it's good to have you back. - (grunts) Yeah. Hey, if you go there in the parlour and look in that bag of mine, I got a surprise for you. - A present. - Maybe. - Come on. Oh, oh my God! - Bye Bus. - Bye. - Bye, Mrs. Riley. - [Mrs. Riley] Bye, Judy. If you never have another friend in the world, Gussie'll make up for it. - Well, it's good to be a big shot to someone. - [Mrs. Riley] I remembered you like pancakes for breakfast. Anything else? - Yeah, mom. You got any of those, uh, those new sausages? (lips smack) - Sausages it'll be. (footsteps pattering) - It's a camera. I always wanted a camera. - [Mrs. Riley] You got her a camera? (Gussie crying) (Bus sighing) - (laughs) I got, I got it in Tokyo, mom. Get 'em cheap there. - In Tokyo? (laughs) I bet I'm the only kid in school who's got a camera from Tokyo. - Oh, I got a present for Paula, and I got one from mom. - Hey. Hey. It's Christmas. - Ah hey, you. I, I gotta take a shower. Hey. (hand thumps) See after school, huh? Hmm? (sighs) Paula, shh. (emotional music) - Gussie, now quick run over to the grocery store and get a package of those little sausages that he likes. - I'll be late for school. - I don't care if you are. He wants 'em for breakfast so hurry. (footsteps pattering) - I gotta run an errand. You wanna come with me? - Sure. (gentle emotional music) - Come on. - He's gorgeous. (playful music) (playful music builds) (gentle playful music) (Bus laughing) (water splashing) (Bus whistling) (sentimental music) (gentle music) - [Simmons] It's nine straight up, sir, if you're going to make your flight. - [Husband] Alright, Simmons. You can take the bags out to the car. Tell Jeffries I'll be down directly. I'm just going to look in on my wife for a moment. - [Simmons] Very good, sir. (door clatters) (gentle emotional music) (fabric rustling) (door clatters) (gentle music) (suspenseful music) (fabric rustling) (sausages sizzling) - And I'd gotten so used to the Navy after three years, mom. I, uh, I didn't know how I was gonna feel coming out as civilian. You know, in the service they've always got a job for you and they've got some clown over you to make sure you do it. But, uh, but in civilian life, I guess you gotta find your own way, you know? Responsibilities, obligations. - The A and W Garage needs a new mechanic. I think that Les has just been waiting for you to come home and take the job. - (sighs) No, I don't, I don't want the job, mom. - Bus, you're a wonderful mechanic. - I, uh... (coughs) See, this friend of mine gave a job offer, guy named Spence. He lives here. He's a mortician. - You wanna be an undertaker? - Well, they don't call 'em undertakers anymore, mom. They call 'em mortician. - Oh. You think you'd be happy in that kind of work? - Yeah. - Working with dead people? - You get over it after a while, mom. Besides, I think there's a... I think there's a future in it for me. - But you'd have a future as a mechanic. You'd own your own garage someday and you could take a night course in engineering. - That would be four or five years. - Well, what's your hurry? You're young. - I just, (sighs) I want a job that'll get me respect. - Why can't a mechanic have respect? (chair rustling) - (clears throat) You know, I'd sure like to have a new suit now. Go over and see old Spence. My old clothes don't fit me anymore. I think I'm gonna get some new ones. (zipper whirs) I'll see you later, mom. - Bus. - Yeah? - Laurel Murdoch got married to an older man with lots of money. I knew you'd find out sooner or later. (emotional music) (Bus sighs) I dreaded telling you. - It's okay. (whimsical emotional music) (cards shuffling) - Did anybody here happen to see Alice Murchison's hair last night? - Hideous? - I'm convinced the poor dear is moulting. I told her. I swear I did. You know me after three daiquiris. I said, "Alice, darling, if that isn't a wig you're wearing, you should sue your hairdresser." - You didn't. - I did. Anna Bright. Really I've seen buildings condemned on less provocation. - I'll bid. Spade. - I pass. Your bid, dear. - Uh, heart. - Oh, that's insufficient dear. Your partner bid one spade. - Two heart, then. - Two, no trump. - Me, they team with a kamikaze pilot. Oh, waiter. - Yes, ma'am. - Another scotch and soda. And tell the bar keep to spill some in the glass this time. - Would you care for anything else, ladies? - No, thank you. - Not for me, thanks. - It's a little early in the day to start drinking, isn't it? - Not for me. I'm on Rocky Mountain Time. - Uh, scotch and soda. - Scotch and soda. Say, I hear an old buddy of yours is back in town. - Yeah. Who's that? - Bus Riley. - Bus Riley. When did he get back? - Mm, yesterday I think. - How about that. Nice guy, Bus. Did you ever meet him? - No. Oh, I've heard of him, but I never met him. (liquid splashing) (hood creaking) - [Les] If you can start this car I'll take your car and uh, 50 bucks. - How many miles on it? - Uh, truth, 50,000. - It's not bad. - [Les] Well, it's got good tyres, but uh... (hand smacks) (car rumbling) (gentle upbeat music) (engine revving) (engine revving) (upbeat music stops) - Well, go ahead, try it. - What'd you do? - Nevermind. Just try it. (door rattles) (engine revving) - All right. (screwdriver clangs) (door slams) (footsteps pattering) I owe you 50, right? - When you gonna come work for me? - (laughs) You just uh, clean my windshield off, will you? (footsteps pattering) (door clattering) (door slams) (engine revving) (engine revving) (cars crashing) (gentle dramatic music) (door clatters) (doors slamming) (sentimental music) - Hello, Bus. (sentimental music) Aren't you even gonna say hello to me? - Yeah, I'm uh, I'm thinking about it. - Is your car alright? - Yeah. Yeah it's all right. - Have I done much damage, Bus? - (clears throat) No. - I'm so happy to see you home. Three years is such a long time. - (clears throat) Look, Laurel, you better uh, you better back your car out so I can uh, so I can pull out. Okay? - Bus. I'm sorry. - It's all right. - It was all my fault. - No, hey, it's a, it's a, it's a small accident. Nobody's, nobody's dead. - Wait. Could we maybe go for a cup of coffee or something? - No, I don't think so. - Please wait. (door clatters) What about the car? Can I at least pay for the damage? - No, there's no damage. Don't, uh... Look, why don't, why don't we just forget it? Okay. I'll see ya. (dramatic music) (door slams) (sad organ music) ♪ Heart has found me ♪ ♪ Angel voices ring ♪ (door clatters) ♪ Pearly gates are open ♪ ♪ Open for the king ♪ ♪ Hail the king of glory ♪ ♪ Hail the king of love ♪ ♪ He is at ♪ - (shushes) There's a service coming up pretty soon. Having a dress rehearsal. Old lady Herndon from out west of town. Died from a heart attack when one of her cats was hit by a moving van. Poor old dear. Want to look at her? - Oh, no. - Why? You're not afraid of death, are you? - No. - She's lying there as natural as life. Pretty as a picture. She was a sight when they first brought her here, but Spencer's an artist. He dolls 'em up 'til they look like chorus girls. Come on. Oh. You used to look after the house for Spencer, didn't you? - Yeah. - Where you been all this time? - Just got out of the Navy. - Oh, yeah. Yes, I think Spencer told me. - Bus. What are you doing here, boy? (Bus laughs) - I'll have no more drinking round here. You'll have to see through the ceremony today. All the Herndon kin are coming from miles round. I want you on your best behaviour. - I got your postcard from Hong Kong. How are those Chinese girls? (Bus laughs) You're back home for good, Bus? - Yeah. Yeah, I am. - Well, it's good to hear that. It's good to have someone so lively as you around a place like this. - Yeah, Spence. - Yeah. - I'm uh, I'm looking for a job. - Are you, kid? - Yeah. - Come into my office. I think we can talk better there. (footsteps pattering) - Spence. - Yeah, Bus. - Do you remember you told me once that uh, that you might have a job for me when I got out of the Navy? - Yeah, I did, didn't I? - Did you mean it? - Sure, I meant it. I said I'd send you to night school for a year to learn the trade, didn't I? - Yeah. See, I wanna make something of myself, and I'd work hard. I wouldn't let you down. And I'd like to get started right away. - All right, kid. You're hired. (hand thumps) I'll send you to mortician school at night. During the day you can help around here. I'll take care of all your expenses and, and I'll pay you a hundred dollars a week. How's that? - (laughs) That's great. - Look, Bus. - Why don't you go home, pack all your stuff and come on over and move in as soon as you can, hm? - Uh, you mean move in here? - Yeah, sure. I, I want you here with me. - Well, yeah, but I didn't, I didn't know he wanted me to uh, move in. - I'm a lonely man, Bus. (dramatic music) (dramatic music builds) (upbeat music) - No, Laurel. He ain't showed up yet. Well, I'll tell him if I see him. Okay, Laurel. (door clattering) (phone clattering) Well, well look who's here. What's the matter, Bus? You look like you just came from a funeral. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. I have. - Who died? - Oh, I don't know. I, I guess I did. (laughs) - Oh. - How are you, Howie? - Oh. I'm okay, Bus. Oh, I almost forgot. Just before you came in, Laurel called. - Oh, for me? - Something about her insurance company needing particulars. Said you'd know what it was all about. You were to phone her at home right away, she said. - Yeah. Man, this town has changed. Three years. You know, it, it even feels different. - Well, nothing stands still, kid. Nothing. - (laughs) Yeah, I guess not. - Look, Bus. I know it's none of my business, but, well, you and Laurel, I always figured that- - Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's like you say. Nothing stands still. (upbeat music) - Got any ideas now that you're back, Bus, about what you're gonna do? - No. (laughs) No. No, I don't. I, I thought I had everything figured out. I'm not so sure anymore. I kept telling myself Howie, you know, the whole time I was away, that when I was, I was coming back to something, but uh, I'm back. I guess I gotta get a job. - Job. Things are pretty tight right now. - Yeah. Yeah. I know. How's a guy get a job, Howie? A decent job without a college education. - You were a machinist in the Navy. Get a job at A and W. They need a mechanic. - Grease monkey. No. No thanks. - Oh, you're so right. Maybe you'd like to serve muffins at the Colonial Tea Room. (Bus Laughs) - [Howie] Hey, I'm sorry, Bus. I'll go down to the bank and suggest that they make you president. - [Bus] Hey, do me a favour, huh? Drop Dead. (Howie laughs) - My name is Waller Slocum. Friends call me Wally. You'll pardon me for eavesdropping, but I can offer a young man like you an important future. - I've known this boy quite a few years, Mr. Slocum. His name's Bus Riley. - Well, I'm glad to meet you. - Pleasure. - I'll be at my office in half an hour. Why don't you drop in and see me then? - I uh, oh yeah. Oh, alright. - Remember now, it's not a job I'm offering you, (paper crinkling) but a future. - Future. - Keep the change. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Slocum. (hand thumps) (footsteps clicking) - Who's that? - He comes in here every afternoon, usually with a dame. Drives a caddy. (door slams) Always has plenty of money. What's the card say? - Waller Slocum. It's over at the plaza. Says the uh, The Atomic Method. (birds chirping) - Why don't we go for a hike and take some pictures? - I'd like to, but I can't. I have to do the housework. - Can't you let it go for a day? - If I let it go, I'll just have twice as much to do tomorrow. - Want me to help you? - Want to? - Yeah, I'll help. - Okay. Come on. (dramatic music) - And I told your father to stay out of the lagoon, Luana. It's full of crocodiles. - Maybe father not care anymore. Now that that hated, poor chief he has driven us from our village. (crying) (door clatters) - I mean to make everything up to you, Luana. (door thuds) - Hi, mom. - Shh! - [Luana] Can you bring me back my father? (footsteps pattering) - But I'll win back your village, Luana. I swear I will. (romantic music) - I brought Gussie home to help me. - Well, that's nice. Did you order groceries for supper? - Yes. - What are we gonna have? - Meatloaf. - [Judy's Mother] Couldn't you think of something better than meatloaf? - Listen, I have orchestra practise tonight. I don't have time for anything else. - Yeah, I bet Gussie thinks I'm a horrible mother. Just sitting around the house all day. (sighs) To tell the truth, I haven't been feeling so well lately, have I honey? - No. - I'll help you, Judy, honey. (smacks) I'll uh... (people shouting) I'll empty the ashtrays. Oh, oopsy daisy. (people shouting) - Well, I can always count on mother to empty the ashtrays. - Remember now, it's not our vacuum sweeper you are selling, but a new scientific method of sanitising the home. Never present yourself to the housewife as a salesman. Never. You are offering her an opportunity to share in the latest scientific research and to protect her loved ones. You must think of yourself as an agent who is fulfilling the American housewife's needs. You must understand those needs. The American housewife is sometimes a very lonely woman, Riley. She is your responsibility. - Yeah, uh, uh, responsibility. - Yeah, and it's a serious responsibility. When you approach her, do not feel it necessary to keep smiling. In fact, do you need to smile at all? Smiles don't impress anyone today. We're more impressed by a man's urgency. - Urgency? - Yeah. (footsteps pattering) (case clattering) Oh, I trust you have a becoming business suit. - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. - Excellent, excellent. It is most important in this work to create a favourable first impression. - Mm. - Oh, uh, try to get a manicure, huh? - Oh. - Remember, Riley, I'm expecting big things of you. (Bus sighs) (latches clattering) (items rustling) - Thank you. Were there any calls, Simmons? - Your husband phoned to say that he'd be delayed a few more days. - Did he leave a number? - No. He said he'd call back. - Didn't a Mr. Riley call? - No, ma'am. - Thank you, Simmons. (footsteps pattering) (phone clattering) Mr. Ogilby, please. Mrs. Aiken. Benji? Hi. Hey, I was wondering if you might do me a favour. That is, if you're not busy tonight. Good. Well, Ellis is out of town again, and I just can't face another evening alone with the television set. And I was wondering, would you mind terribly taking an old married lady out on the town tonight? Oh, no, no, no. You don't have to come all the way over here. I'll pick you up. About nine? Okay. Oh, thank you so much, Benji. Bye-bye. (phone clatters) (engine rumbling) (car creaking) (door slamming) (footsteps thumping) (sewing machine rattling) - Hey. (door slams) Hey, ma. I got a job. (sewing machine rattling) Hey. - Hello. - Anybody home? - Oh. - Ma, I got a job. (sewing machine rattling) - Mrs. Riley. Uh, Mrs. Riley. I don't know how much more I can take. Your son is disturbing my rest and I'm, I'm trying to cure one of my sick headaches. Mrs. Riley. Must he be so obstreperous, Mrs. Riley? - I'll speak to him, Carlotta. I'm sorry about your headache. (door slams) - Oh. Oh. - Are you going to be a mortician? - No. No, no, no, no. Never. No, God. - Well, what kind of a job is it? - Well, you see, I can't tell you, mother because it's very, very scientific. - Scientific. - Yes. Scientific. I must tell you that. Look, you see, mother, it's a whole new revolutionary way of living. - Revolutionary. - Yes. Revolutionary. - I see. - Scientific. - I see. - Top secret. I can't tell you but I wish I could, (Mrs. Riley shushing) But I can't tell you. - Bus, Bus. - I'm sorry, but I can't tell you. Please. No, no, no, no. Stop. What? (Mrs. Riley shushing) - Would you please try to be more quiet around the house? - Oh. - Now, Carlotta is a very highly strung woman and sometimes she comes home with nervous headaches. - Oh, headaches. That's a poor dear. Alright, lovely. Thank you. I remember Carlotta. Poor dear. Headaches. Yeah. (cutlery clinking) I saying you have a headache. - Mm. - Hm? (Gussie laughs) Today. School. - All right. There you go. - I love your new car. - Me too. I'm hot about convertibles. - What'd you say? - I'm wild about convertibles. - Oh. - I'm gonna miss the old car. It was one of the few things that your father left to us. - You had a call while you were in the shower. - Hm? - Some girl. She didn't care to leave her name, but uh, I'm sure it was Laurel Aiken. - Oh, I'm sure it wasn't. - I'm sure it wasn't. A girl in Laurel's position does not go around calling boys. (Bus coughs) - Why wouldn't she? You just don't know what kind of girl she is. That's all I'd like to say. - You need to knock it off, Paula. - Paula, you've just been listening to gossip. - It's not gossip. It's only common knowledge that she- - Shut up, Paula. (cutlery clinking) (energetic music) - Stretch, who is the chick over there in the blue sweater? - Oh, that's the new ministers daughter. - (laughs) Hallelujah, I found the way. (energetic music) (energetic music continues) - What'll you fellas have? - Mm, I'll have you baby. - Hands off, Egg Foo Young. (Bus laughs) - Vodka and tonic. - Uh, scotch on the rocks for me, if you please. - Okay, folks. (energetic music) - What are you doing after, uh, work tonight, sugar? - Nothing that would interest you, Stretch. - Two beers and coke. (energetic music) - Nice to see you home again, Bus. - Yeah. Thanks, Naomi. - Well, how 'bout that? Nothing that would interest you, Stretch. Nice to see you home again, Bus. (Egg Foo laughs) (people chattering) (coins clinking) (sensual music) (sensual music continues) - That's, uh, that's your old girlfriend, ain't it, Bus? (Stretch laughs) (sensual music) (people shuffling) (sensual music continues) (high energy sensual music) (footsteps pattering) (engine rumbling) (gentle music) - Hi, handsome. Want a lift? - No thanks. Is that all you have to do? Ride around, pick up guys, give 'em lifts? - Sure. It's my favourite pastime. Get in. (gentle upbeat music) - What happened to your boyfriend? - Oh, he's not a boyfriend. He's a friend. Come on, get in. - No, no thanks. - Oh. Aren't we proud? (engine revving) (footsteps pattering) (crickets chirping) (footsteps crunching) (crickets chirping) (zipper whirring) (gentle music) (gentle music intensifies) (footsteps crunching) - You're just wasting time. You might as well give in. - What is it, Laurel? - Please get in. - What for? - I wanna talk to you. - I don't see the point. - I won't make a pass. I promise. I just gotta talk to you, Bus. - Okay. (door slams) (engine revving) (engine revving) (gentle music) - (laughs) That was the place we first met. Remember that? (laughs) You were the scrawniest lifeguard I had ever seen. You filled out since then. - So have you. - Can I take that as a compliment? - Sure. Just don't build anything out of it. - Oh, you didn't used to be so careful with your compliments. You used to think I was all there was in the whole department store. - Used to. - I didn't even get to see you in your little, little sailor suit. - I never saw you in your bridal gown. You did wear white, didn't you? - Oh. (laughs) Could have lived without that remark. - (sighs) What do you expect? And what are we doing here anyway? (grunts) What are we trying to prove? - I'm not trying to prove anything. - You got what you wanted. I did it for you. Daddy made me agree to marry Ellis. He could have put you in prison, Bus. He would've. I was only 17. - All he had to do was give his consent. That's all. I didn't want him to set me up in business. - You came back. You swore you never would. - I came back because I wanted to make something of myself. But I have to start somewhere. - Make something of me, Bus. - The jobs filled, Mrs. Aiken. (sighs) Well, let's get outta here. - Please take me home, Bus. Ellis is away and I'm all alone. I've gotta talk to somebody. Please. Honey, I'm just miserable. (emotional music) - Yeah. Misery's a big club. But there's one nice thing about it. Any, anybody can join. (emotional music) (engine revving) (calm music) - Aren't you ever gonna drink anything stronger than Coke? - No. - Just because your father was a lurch doesn't mean you have to be. You're missing a lot of fun. (footsteps pattering) - Maybe not. - I would just love to see you get turned on sometimes. Why don't you like me anymore? - No, I like you, Laurel. (gentle music) I've just gotten over you. - Oh, yeah? (gentle dramatic music) I bet you haven't. (gentle dramatic music) I bet you're afraid to kiss me. - Why? Why should I be? - Because, because if you kiss me just once, you'd be just as hooked as you ever were. (dramatic music) (Laurel laughs) (gentle dramatic music) - Say, doesn't that, uh, doesn't that husband of yours ever give you any fun? - I hate you. - Couple of minutes ago you were mad for me. (footsteps clicking) (upbeat dramatic music) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Hey! Ow! (Laurel laughs) (shoes thudding) - Mm. (laughs) (water splashing) - [Bus] Mm. (wincing) (dramatic music) (water splashing) - Come on. Don't be mad. (dramatic music) (Laurel laughs and shouts) (water splashing) (Laurel shouts) (water splashing) (Laurel shouts) (Laurel gasps) - No! (shouts) (Laurel shouts) (Bus grunts) (Laurel shouts) (upbeat dramatic music) (water splashing) (Bus sighs) (Laurel shouts) (both grunting) - You had enough? - Oh, please stop. - You never let up, do you? (Laurel panting) (Laurel moaning) - I like your tattoo. (Laurel moaning) (lips smacking) (both panting) (gentle dramatic music) (footsteps pattering) (sentimental music) (footsteps clicking) (Bus sighs) (sentimental music) (engine rumbling) (door rattles) (doors slam) (case rustling) (footsteps pattering) (doors slam) (footsteps tapping) (case thumping) (doorbell ringing) (birds chirping) (fabric rustling) (hand thumping) (knocker clacking) (door clattering) - Mrs. Griswold. - Who? - Isn't this the Jules Griswold residence? - Jules Griswold? (laughs) He's a multimillionaire. He lives in a big estate way down there. Oh, he's got 30 rooms, half a dozen automobiles, a lot of servants. - I beg your pardon, madam. I hope I haven't disturbed you. - Oh, no. Say, uh, what made you think this was the Griswold home? - Well it's such a charming house, such excellent taste. - Oh, thank you. (laughs) It's new. We like it. (laughs) - You see, my partner and I were just delivering something to the Griswolds. The results of the latest research at the atomic development centre in the city. - That so? Is that it? - Yes. This case contains the results of several years of scientific experiments. - Well, what is it? - A revolutionary device, madam. Atomic science has finally turned to the American home. - Oh, say, uh, could I see it maybe? - Did the, uh, Griswolds specify an exact time we would appear there, Riley? - Uh, uh, uh no I, I don't think so. - Well, what difference will a few more minutes make? - Oh. (laughs) Well, do come in. Come on. (laughs) - If, uh, Griswold is upset, I'll make it up to him next time I see him at the club. We, uh, sometimes play squash together. - Oh. (laughs) - Riley, would you mind unpacking our product for me? - Oh, yeah. (latches clattering) - Oh! (laughs) Lovely. - Do you realise, madam, that over half the deaths in this great country are caused by bacteria in the home? - Bacteria? - Every home is a nesting place for bacteria, germs, and larvae. - Well, is that a fact? - But at last, atomic research has finally put an end to this unfortunate condition. Every home can now be as thoroughly clean and sanitary as a hospital laboratory. - Oh. - Riley, would you please place one of our Nuclear Mist Bombs? - Yeah. - Bombs? - Oh, never fear, madam. The Nuclear Mist Bomb is the most vital agent fighting disease in our country today. - Oh, yeah. - Shall we, uh, demonstrate? - Oh, yes, please do. (laughs) Yeah. - Now this bomb, like all bombs, makes a noise, but I don't think you'll find it too disturbing. Thank you. (timer ticking) Count down. - Oh. (laughs) Hm. - Are we, uh, ready now? - Oh, yes. Let's go. (laughs) (timer ticking) (button clicks) (bomb booms) (housewife screams) - Oh, there there now, madam. Everything's gonna be all right. All right. Just relax. In exactly 10 minutes this room will be completely disinfected. And then my partner will apply our new vacuum attachment that absorbs all the bacteria that have been destroyed, carpets, draperies, the furniture by our atomic missile. - Maybe you'd like a cup of coffee while we're waiting. - If you're sure it's no trouble. - Oh, no trouble at all. (laughs) (bomb beeping) - (snaps) Sold. (bomb beeping) - (clears throat) Ma'am, do you realise how many deaths each year are caused by germs in, inside the home? - I divorced the only germ inside this home three months ago. - (laughs) Yes, well, more than, more than half, uh, uh, of the deaths each year are- - You know something? (smacks) You're cute. - (laughs) Oh, yeah? - When's your birthday? - Uh, April. April, uh, 3rd. Uh, I have a very interesting attachment, uh, here, ma'am. - Oh! That's Aries. I get along just great with Aries men. (laughs) See, I'm Capricorn and when Capricorn and Aries get together it's absolutely dynamic. - (laughs) No kidding. - Yeah, my husband was a Gemini. They're no fun at all. - No. Well, uh, I really don't know too much about that, ma'am. - Call me Joy. (sensual music) - Uh, (laughs) Joy. - (laughs) Geminis are awful squares. You're not square, are you? - (laughs) Well, I, uh, I don't think so. - Good. (laughs) Oh, why be square? I always say a world's round. (Bus panting) You don't like square things, do you? - Uh, well I guess not. - Know something? I believe in ESP too and well, right now, my senses tell me you're gonna kiss me. (dramatic music) - You mean to tell me you have a daughter in high school? - Yes. I may be a little older than you think. - [Bus] Oh. - Of course, I was married very young. Practically a child. - Not that hard to believe. - I was elected beauty queen in school. - Really? - Mm-hmm. My husband was insanely jealous of me. (laughs) - Yes, I'll, uh, I'll bet he was. (Bus coughs) - He divorced me and went to live in California. I don't get enough alimony to have a maid. I have to do all the housework myself. - That's, uh, too bad. - I get terribly lonely at times. - I, uh, I can't understand how and man could walk off and leave a beautiful woman like you. - But he did. What did I do to have such a terrible life? (crying) (footsteps pattering) - (clears throat) Hey, you, you mustn't feel that way. (door clattering) - Mother. (footsteps pattering) - I thought you played volleyball on Thursdays, Judy. - Hey, I didn't know this was your home. - Oh, forget it. You don't have to apologise. It's happened before. - What? - I've come home and found mother with a, a friend. - Hey, look, I was just trying to be understanding. I mean, I'm trying to sell something. I'm sorry. Honest, I'm sorry. - Did she buy one? - Yeah. - Well, I don't know how we're gonna pay for it. We haven't paid the grocery bill in two months. - Hey. Uh, I'll talk her out of it, huh? I'll tell her that we're out of the product just, or something. Okay? - Yeah. Okay. (footsteps thumping) (playful music) - (gasps) Come on. Here. Here. Here. Here. Look. Look. Look. Look. Come on. (door clattering and thudding) (Laurel laughing) - Hey, listen. You know, every, every time I come in this house that maid of yours treats me like a burglar. - It's, uh, very middle class to wonder what the, uh, servants think. (sensual music) - Say, uh, listen it, uh, it may not be any of my business, but, uh, doesn't that husband of yours ever, ever show up? - Oh, well, uh, he was here last Sunday, but, uh, he had to fly to Iran to see some more oil wells. - Yeah. Say, uh, how, how would you like to go for a ride? - Why? Oh, it's so comfy here. - Uh, well, I thought maybe you might like a change. I mean, uh, we've never been out this, this room since I've been back. - Well, there's everything here want, isn't there? - Well, you know, some, some people go to a show, uh- - Yeah. - Swimming. - Yeah. - Or bowling. - Mm-hmm. Well, you said yourself that, uh, we shouldn't be seen out together. - Yeah, well, uh, this, this place gets to be like a cage, you know, with a couple of- - Yeah. - A couple of animals. - Yeah, baby. - You- - Yeah. - And me. - Yeah. - Here, together. (Laurel laughs and purrs) You know, that's, uh, that's the thinnest watch I've ever seen. (playful music) - Why don't you keep it? - No. - Oh, go on. He'll never miss it. He's got dozens of watches. - No. - Don't be so moral for heaven's sakes. Isn't it pretty? Hmm? - Yeah. (Laurel laughing) (sensual music) (suspenseful music) (Judy coughing) (scary dramatic music) (Judy coughing) - Mother. Mother! (fist thudding) Mother! (coughs) Mother! (fist thudding) (coughs) Mother! (coughs) (intense dramatic music) (phone whirring) (sirens blowing) (footsteps pattering) (door clattering) (Carlotta screaming) (door slams) (toilet flushing) - What's going on? - Nothing's wrong. I went out today. Nothing's wrong. Let's just, just everybody go to bed. Okay? Just go to bed. (feet stomping) (door slamming) (footsteps pattering) (luggage rattling) (Carlotta sniffling) - Mrs. Riley. Mrs. Riley. I'm giving my month's notice, but I'm moving out today. (money rustling) - Oh, well, I'm sorry, Carlotta. Is anything wrong? - Oh, yes, Mrs. Riley. This is a great deal wrong. I cannot live in this house with that boy of yours anymore. (Carlotta sniffling) - I'm sorry, Carlotta. - He comes in at all hours of the night and he sounds like some wild man from Borneo. And he turned this place into a jungle and he appears in the hall and he is not fully clothed. - The school semester's almost over, Carlotta. - Oh, I know that. But I just can't, I just can't risk the chance of having another nervous breakdown. (sniffling) - I'm sorry, Carlotta. - Here are the keys to my room. (Carlotta sniffling) (luggage rattling) - Goodbye, Carlotta. (door thuds) (keys jingling) (shoes clattering) - Did Carlotta leave? - Yes. - Groovy. (doorbell rings) Hey Mom, it's Judy. Hi, Judy. What's wrong? - My house burned down last night. - What? Gussie, my mother's dead. (luggage clattering) She must have been smoking in bed again. (crying) - We're your friends. Stay here with us. Don't cry. - Hey, mom. Oh, morning, Paula. (sad organ music) (footsteps thumping) How are you Spence? - Hiya, kid. (door thudding) (engine rumbling) - Excuse me. (footsteps tapping) You wanna ride with me? - Yeah. - Judy, you go to the cemetery with Bus. (engine rumbling) (footsteps pattering) (door thudding) (engine rumbling) (water splashing) - I hated her sometimes but I loved her too. (birds chirping) (water splashing) (dramatic music) (footsteps pattering) (gentle dramatic music) Is that what life is? Just loving and hating? Isn't there some kind of love that leaves you peaceful inside? (gentle dramatic music) - When I was a kid, I worked very hard. I, I sold newspapers and I caddied out the country club. Later when I was a little older, I, I lifeguarded the lake and I saved all my money because I knew one day that I'd wanna go to college, thinking all the time my father was investing it until the day came for me to go to college and it wasn't there. He'd, uh, he'd spent it all on liquor. - Oh, Bus. - Yeah. But I used to blame him and I used to hate him because I thought he did these things to, to spite me. - Yeah. It's so hard not to hate them and you don't want to hate them. - No. - I used to get so angry at my mother that sometimes I thought I could kill her. Then I, I realised how sick she was and how unhappy. I felt terribly ashamed. (gentle dramatic music) - You know, it seems you have to, you have to forgive everybody. (dramatic music) - Yeah. (energetic music) (energetic music stops) - What's wrong? - What am I, what am I doing? - What? - I'm miserable. - Why? - I quit my job, for one thing. - Well get another. - You got any suggestions? - (laughs) Honey, I don't know anything about jobs. - Oh, boy. I hate myself every time I leave this place. - Why? - I don't know why. I just do. - It's your puritan conscience. - No, a puritan conscience has nothing to do with it. I just don't feel myself much of a man. - Oh, I think you're very much of a man. - Now, see. - Hmm? - You're talking about one thing. - Yeah. - And I'm talking about another. - For instance? - To me, a man isn't much of a man unless he means something to someone. - Well, don't you think you mean something to me? - I don't, I don't think so. - Mm, come here. (moans) - Now we make love over and over again. - Yeah. - And it never gets us anywhere 'cause we end up right in this room. - I could get the boats one weekend and we could take a cruise up the river. - Hey, is that... Is that your idea of getting someplace? - Well, where do you wanna get? - I would love to get me something. - Like what? - Like kids, family, - a home. - Yeah. Yeah. Well, I, I'd give you those things if I could, you know I would. Now will get off of it, please? - Okay, sweetheart. Listen. I'm gonna cut out, huh? I'm gonna get home early. - Well, don't go. - I'm not gonna go, I'm not going through this routine over and over again. - You've got another girl. - I'll call you later, Laurel. - Will you come tomorrow? - Maybe. - Maybe. What do you mean maybe? You trying to get rid of me? - Why don't you get off it? - Call me. - Alright. - Promise? - Yeah, I said I would. - If you don't, I'll call you. - Now, don't you call me. Don't you ever call me again. - (grunts) Well, what am I gonna do now? I look forward to seeing you all day and, and being with you at night. Now, I got nothing to do. - That's your problem. (door thuds) - Oh. - I just don't see why you can't stay with us forever. - Because I'm a minor. I, I have to live with my next of kin. - You haven't seen your father since you were a baby. - It doesn't make any difference. - We're your friends. - I know that. The only way I could stay is if I quit school and got a job. - Well, wouldn't it be wonderful if you could marry Bus? (Judy laughs) (Bus knocks) - Hey, girls. (sighs) - What are you doing? - Well, I, I came to rob the place. - Well see, this is the first time you've been home before morning. - And, and nevermind. - Long- - Nevermind. - Ages. - Big month. - I'm sorry. I love you. (lips smacking) What you been doing? - Just out riding around. - Riding where? - Up and down the road. Just looking at all the pretty scenery. (laughs) Want to go? Wanna go for a ride? - Yeah, sure. - Come on. - Better change. - No, I don't think I wanna go. - (laughs) Oh, all right. - (laughs) Well, I'm tired. I'm very tired. - Yeah. - I am. - What? All right. All right. Uh, come on. The carnival? Do you like carnivals? - Yeah. - Have a good time. (gentle music) - How old are you? - 17. Why? - Oh, I just wondered, you, uh, you seem older. - Well, I'll be 18 soon. - Huh. Well, you still seem older. - I, I guess I grew up pretty fast taking care of mother. - Oh, yeah. (gentle music) What do you think of me? - I, I think you're the nicest man I ever met. - Really? - Yes. (gentle dramatic music) - Why? (gentle dramatic music) - I, I guess it was the way you talked to me that day. You knew exactly what I felt as if you'd looked inside and seen everything that was there. - You dated many boys? - No. (laughs) Not really. I was never very attracted to boys my own age, nor they to me. I always felt like their mother. - What do you feel like with me, Judy? - A girl. - I wanna kiss you. (romantic music) Thank you. - You don't have to thank me. - Thank you. (gentle music) A male model? - Well, you said you wanted another job. - Yeah. Yeah. What do I, what do I know about modelling? - They teach you, and as I said, it pays very well. - Yeah. All right. What's, uh, (laughs) what's his name? What do I say? - All right he's in the Colfax building in the city at 10th of Market. He's on the 16th floor. - Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Later. (phone slams) - What was that all about? - Nothing. (footsteps thumping) (sentimental music) (paper ripping) Nothing. (melancholic music) (upbeat music) - Les. - Yeah? (tools clanking) - I'm through. - [Les] Hey, that's wonderful, Bus. - Who does this old buggy belong to? - Oh, a big shot around town named Jules Griswold. He inherited a lot of money a couple of years ago. (car whooshing) Hey, uh, would you do me a favour, Bus? - This wasn't. - Oh, come on. I cancelled all your fuel bill with me. It was $36. Now you don't owe me a cent. - [Bus] All right. - [Les] Would you take the car out to him? - Yeah. Yeah. - He and his wife are living it up in the old Havemeyer estate. You know where that is, don't you? - Yeah. It's on the edge of town. - Yeah. - Yeah. All right. I gotta clean up, though. - Well, he wants it as soon as possible. Maybe you better go now. - All right. All right. (joyful music) (horn honking) - Here it is. Here it is. Come on, you two. Hurry up. We can't keep Benji waiting at the club all day. Hi there. (door thudding) - Hey. (melancholic music) (engine rumbling) - Come on, honey. Hurry up. Hurry up. We'll never get there. We'll drop you off at the garage, son, or wherever it is you came from. We gotta hurry on over at the club. Some of our friends are having a race. (dramatic whimsical music) (planes whirring) - You, you like to come back and visit sometime, Judy? - [Judy] Maybe. - I told her that you and I would drive up this summer to see her. - Oh, yeah? - Uh, Nichols. I just wanna walk her out, okay? (dramatic music) - See you soon. Goodbye. - Bye. (gentle dramatic music) (planes whirring) - Thank you. (gate clanking) (dramatic music) (plane whooshing) - I know she's very young for her age, but she's very, very old and she knows everything about housekeeping and she knows how to cook. - You're trying to tell me something? - Yes. (glasses thumping) (cutlery clinking) - Hazel. - Bus, may I have the car tonight? - What for? - I don't see why I have to tell you what for. You're not my father. - [Mrs. Riley] Can't Stu get his car tonight, Paula? - [Paula] I suppose he could. (cutlery clinking) - What are you laughing at, Gertrude? - (laughs) Nothing. - She's laughing because I don't have a date with Stu. - Who have you got a date with? - Larry O'Brian. He's new in town. - Brian. Brian's a good name. I thought you were, uh, I thought you were going with Stu. - I was. - [Mrs. Riley] Have you quit going steady with Stu? - Not exactly. - [Mrs. Riley] Then why are you dating somebody else? - I don't see why I have to tell anybody why I'm dating somebody else. - Well, I was just curious. That's all. - I've seen this, uh, this O'Brian kid down at the cave. He's, uh, he's bad news. He's no good, ma. He's no good. - Is that right? - That's right. - Well, I'd like to know who you think you are, Bus Riley, criticising the guys I date. - Two-timing. You call it two-timing. - I'm not two-timing anybody Stu knows I'm going out with other boys. Besides, we both decided that I'm too young to go steady. - Hm. Well, tell me something, uh, princess. What am I supposed to do for a, a car? - I don't see why you need one anyway. - Paula, you know that Bus makes some of his deliveries at night. - Oh, is that right? Well, that's what you think. He doesn't make any deliveries at night. He just drives over to that floozy's house and stays there until morning. (Bus sighs) - What did you say? - You heard me. - Paula, I don't think I know what you're talking about. - Ask. Ask him where he goes at night and ask him where he got that new wristwatch too. - Damn you, Paula. (dramatic music) - I don't care. He's been bossing me around long enough. Makes me mad. (door clattering) - Bus. (door thuds) Don't let Paula upset you. (gentle dramatic music) Is it true? Did she give you the watch? (dramatic music) - Yeah. - Oh, Bus. - (sighs) Go ahead. Give me hell. Tell me I'm, uh, no good. I'll never amount to anything. - No, I won't because that's what you're telling yourself. - It's true. - [Mrs. Riley] You're acting just the way you did before you left. - I know. - You're losing your self respect. You're walking around with a chip on your shoulder. - I feel like I'm ready for the booby hatch. - I wish I could help, but I don't know what to say. (gentle dramatic music) - (sighs) Tell, uh, (keys jingling) Tell Paula she can have the car. (dramatic music) (footsteps pattering) - Bus, where are you going? (sentimental music) - To get a drink. (footsteps pattering) (door clattering) (footsteps pattering) - Bus. I told you always to call before coming here. (gentle dramatic music) I'm sorry about the other day. You're mad at me, right? (gentle dramatic music) - Laurel, I want to talk to you. - Mm-hmm? - Uh... (emotional music) I want you to tell me something. - Mm-hmm? (intense dramatic music) (Bus smacks) - What? (dramatic music) - You never really wanted to marry me, did you? (Laurel sighs) There was a lot of hot air about your old man not letting you, wasn't it? You didn't want to, Laurel. Admit it. It's the truth. - That's not true exactly. I did want to marry you, but it never would've worked out. You know that. - Tell me why. - (laughs) Bus, look, I've got a few guests coming for dinner. Why don't you come back about midnight and we'll talk about it. All right? (gentle dramatic music) (Bus sighs) - I don't love you, Laurel. - That's not true. - [Bus] Yeah, it's true. - No, you do love me. - I used to. I used to. I used to think the sun rose every morning just so I could see that pretty face. I used to think night came so we could lie in each other's arms. Not anymore. No, I'm going. I'm never coming back. - Oh, don't go. - I, uh, I can't respect us. (dramatic music) (watch clatters) - I'll kill myself if you leave me. - Okay. - I hate you. (crying) I hate you. - And I feel sorry for you. (Laurel crying) - Oh, don't leave me! (door clattering) - [Mr. Aiken] Laurel probably won't be down for hours, so let's have a drink. Uh, hello. How are you? - I'm fine. Fine. How are you? - Uh, uh, let me see now, uh, what's your name again? - Riley. Bus. Bus Riley. - Of course. Uh, uh, this is Mrs. Jules Griswold, Mr. Riley and Mr. Griswold. - How do you do? Riley. Riley. I've heard that name mentioned in the last few days. Are you the Riley who lives out near Seven Oaks? - (laughs) No. No. - Why George, that's... You're the chap who worked on my Lincoln. - Yeah. Yeah. - You're a great mechanic, young man. You know that? Why that car has worked like magic ever since you fixed it. You're a great mechanic, Riley. A great one. (triumphant music) - Yes. Yes, I am. (playful music) (playful music continues) (Bus coughs) (energetic playful music) (sentimental music) (door clatters) - Bus. - Hi. Hi. - Mom's been worried about you. - [Bus] Huh. - I wanted to thank you for letting us use the car. - It's okay. - Yeah, thanks. - It's all right. - I'm Larry O'Brian. - How are you? Sure wanna thank you for letting us use the car. - Oh, it's all right. - Me too, Bus. - It's okay. - Why don't you go get the car? - Yeah. - Bus, is everything okay? - Yeah. Oh yeah. Say, everything's fine. (Bus humming) - Bus, I wanted to say that I'm sorry for everything I said at supper. - (humming) Hey, that's nice. (Bus laughs) (emotional music) - Oh. (sighs) (Bus humming) - Have a good time, huh? - Yeah. (emotional music) (gentle playful music) - Hey, psst. (Bus laughs and claps) (Paula laughs) Uh, don't stay out too late and don't, um, don't drive too fast. - No, I won't. Okay. - He's nice looking. - Yeah. Yeah. (Bus laughs) Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. (gentle music) (door thumps) (engine rumbles) (door clatters) - Honest to goodness, Bus Riley. Where have you been? I have just been worried sick. - Easy, easy, easy. - You're not drunk, are you? - No, I'm not. Me, drunk? No. Come on. (laughs) I've been out. You been worried? - Yes. - Okay. I'm sorry. I was out, I was out thinking. - [Mrs. Riley] Thinking about what? (emotional music) - Hey mom, you suppose there's any way of getting rid of a damn tattoo? (gentle music) (Mrs. Riley laughs) (Gussie laughs) - Hey, Gertrude. Is there any coffee on the stove? - [Gussie] No. (laughs) - [Bus] Well, what do you say we put on a pot? You know, it seems like a long time since we Riley's have just sat around together and had a good talk, huh? (triumphant music)
