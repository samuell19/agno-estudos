[groaning] Cassandra was not the one. It appears she was not. You’ll be entering your 100th year. We must find the one. I am more than aware of what will happen if we do not. We don’t have much time. You’ve got ancient blood that-- Thank you for the reminder, Logan. I’m aware of my lineage and what I must do. Los Angeles. The City of Angels. Let us hope that I find mine. ♪ I’ll make you burn, then I’ll make you fall asleep ♪ ♪ You’ll feel dead when you’re laying under me ♪ ♪ If I take a shot, baby, will it sting? ♪ ♪ Just turn me on, and I’ll do my thing ♪ ♪ Won’t let you crash, and I won’t let you bleed ♪ ♪ You’re like a virus ♪ Hey. Hey, let me help you with those. So, this is the place, huh? Yeah. I know it’s not much, but it does keep the rain out. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be rude. It’s just like the pictures you sent me online. Hey, no offense taken. - Great first impression, huh? - Yeah. - I’m Caleb. - I’m Paul. It’s really nice to finally meet you. Let’s take your stuff inside and get you settled, and I’ll show you around the place. Sounds like a plan. Hey, dude, dude. Not on the grass. Come on. Home sweet home. This place is really... great. Well, I mean, it’s functional, but what more does a college student need, right? Not much more, I suppose. So, uh, first time being away from home. I’ve been on my own about two years now, and I love my freedom. If you don’t mind my asking, how did you find such a great place so cheap? You know, I mean, I have my connections. Actually, um, my parents used to own this place, so it’s all paid for free and clear. Pretty sweet deal. Yeah, no shit. Besides, I have no desire to be anywhere else. I’m a California boy through and through. Sure beats living in Ohio. Doesn’t it smell there? Don’t remind me. Let me take you to the bedroom. It’s really great-- you letting me stay here for free. Hey, like I said, this place is all paid for, and utilities don’t cost much, so you can pitch in with those. Sounds more than fair. I was actually gonna have some coffee. Care to join me? I can show you the neighborhood a bit. My treat. That sounds nice. It’s a pretty friendly neighborhood. I can see that. Quiet, too. Yeah, and they’re pretty receptive to, uh, all types of people. Good to know. Not bad. This was a really great idea. Thanks. Hey. My pleasure. So, what did you do in high school? Basketball? Football? Swimming was my thing. All-state champ three years in a row. Impressive. You could be the next Michael Phelps. I have hung up my Speedo. Focusing solely on academics. Mmm. A brainy jock. So few in existence. Oh, we are a rare breed. [chuckles] Oh, another beautiful California day. Even though I can’t feel the heat of the sun, I’m so pleased that the myths about vampires and the sun were just that-- myths. Yeah. Skin still tans pretty well, too. You two can be absolutely ridiculous at times. Sorry, Logan, we’re not as old and mature as you. - Or as fat. - Children. - Both of you. - Forever and ever. What did you see? It was a person. A male. Someone who will cross our path? Yes. Someone who will be very important to me. - The one? - Don’t be stupid. - He found the one. - Tara? I don’t know if she is. What did he look like? I-- I cannot remember. But I will know him again if I see him. I think there was a connection, and I think he felt it, too. - [snapping fingers] - Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah. That was really weird. Uh... Sorry about that. Hey, it’s okay. But are you okay? Um, what were we talking about? Classes tomorrow. Great. I can’t believe I just got here, and I have to jump right back into classes. Are you sure you’re okay? You look a little pale. I will be. Maybe, just, um, rest a little when we get back to the house. Okay. Um, let’s head back then. Come on. Hello? Who’s there? I’ve seen you before. And I have seen you. Who are you? I would like to know the same of you. I don’t understand what’s going on. Dreams are often subject to interpretation. Is this a dream? Would you prefer a nightmare? No. We’ll meet again. - Morning. - Hey. Morning. Coffee’s ready. Awkward. Um, let me go throw something on. Hey, it’s not a big deal for me if it isn’t for you. We’re roommates, right? So, you ready for your first day? I think so. I didn’t get very much sleep last night. - Homesick? - Nothing like that. I had a weird dream. You remember any of it? I feel like I should remember it, but every time I try, nothing comes to me. Well, you’ll have plenty to take your mind off it today. I took the liberty of looking up your classes online, and we have some classes together. Excellent. I hate being in new situations with everybody staring at me. Mmm. So, how’s the first few hours been? Pretty good, and I think I’m getting into college life. Ah. Just wait until the parties start. That’s true college life. ♪ SOS ♪ ♪ SOS ♪ ♪ Doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor ♪ ♪ In my chest ♪ ♪ In my chest ♪ ♪ Monster, monster, monster ♪ -♪ Send me an SOS ♪ -♪ SOS ♪ ♪ Send me a doctor ♪ Who are they? Um, I don’t know. I mean, I’ve never seen them on campus before. Hi, my name’s Jasin. You’re new here, aren’t you? Just moved here yesterday. Hi, I’m Paul, his roommate. I did not mean to come across forward. I fancy myself a welcome wagon of sorts. It’s not a problem at all. How rude of me. Paul, did you say? Yeah. Let me introduce my brothers. This is Logan, Dane, and Adam. Brothers? Something like that. Hey, guys. I’m...Paul. They don’t say much. I saw you in class earlier today. It looks like we’ll be seeing each other every morning. I suppose so. Can I expect coffee every morning? You just never know. There you are. Hey, guys. So, who are your new friends? I am just neglecting my manners completely today. I’m Caleb. This is Paul. I think you were in one of my classes this morning. I’m Tara. [Paul] Possibly. Was it psych? I thought you looked familiar. Yeah. Small world. So, will I see you tonight? Actually, I was just getting ready to ask my new friend here if he would like a tour of the city. You’re new to L.A.? Fresh off the boat. How about it, Caleb? Uh, yeah, that would be great. Well, I suppose I can take a rain check. We don’t have anything planned this evening, do we? Um, no. No. I mean, go have fun. Are you sure? What if he came with us? Would that be okay? Go. I mean, I’ve seen the city a thousand times. So, you know, we’ll catch up later. - Are you sure? - Yeah. We are roommates, right? We’ll be seeing each other in no time. It’s bound to happen. So this evening. I can pick you up. I don’t have a car, so that would be great. Uh... Uh, here is where I’ll be staying. I put my cell on there, too. Excellent. I think we should go anyway. Your first class is about to start. Uh, we have this one together, right? - Yeah. - Uh, excellent. I’ll be there around 9:00. I’ll see you this evening. That was interesting. I’m sorry? He’s a fine catch for sure, but... [scoffs] - Let it be, Logan. - Mind your own business, Adam. Jasin finding the right one is my business, in case you’ve forgotten. - We all need this. - Remember, his fate is our fate. Let’s not dwell on it for the moment. So, what, are you having second thoughts about Tara? There is something about Caleb. Something I cannot describe. - His blood. - I’ve never inhaled such a fragrance. Oh, he’s definitely appetizing. He is off-limits. Do you all understand? He is not to be harmed in any way. You think he’s the one. Anything is possible. I must feed before tonight. - It’s getting late. - Yeah. Trevor, where’s the spot you’ve got all picked out? Relax. It’s close. It’s worth the wait. [clicks teeth] Wow. Isn’t this worth the wait? Speaking of waiting, Eli, you wanna know what I’ve been waiting a long time for? What? To kiss you. Whoa. Awkward. What are you getting at? I’m getting at I think that the three of us make a nice couple, don’t you? - Two of us make a couple, but three of us-- - Enough, Trevor. Eli, do you find me attractive? You know I always have. Jen, you’re my girlfriend. What’s the deal? [sighs] Would you be interested in sex in the outdoors? Here? [Trevor] Jen, I thought we only talked about this. [sighs] Are you sure? With Eli? I think I’m picking up on what you’re hinting at. Okay. Jesus, Trevor. You wouldn’t pick up on what I’m hinting at if FedEx delivered an invitation to your door. Okay? This is not a hint. I am balls-out asking. Pardon the expression. [Eli] I follow you, Jen. Okay. So, now, to get to me, you’re gonna have to go through him first. Huh? I want you guys to strip down and then give each other a nice big kiss. I’m getting hot just thinking about it. I want you guys to start taking your clothes off, or I’m gonna start putting more clothing on. Yes. Pants, boys. Okay. [mouths words] [Jen] Okay. Now you guys better kiss each other. Well, what do you know? Ah, the shy type. I like that. We don’t want any trouble. We’ll leave. Yeah, the place is all yours. Ah, we were hoping you’d stick around. Six guys, one girl. - Alone in a field. - Sounds like a party to me. You wouldn’t wanna leave the party now, would you? Open your eyes. I said, open your eyes! [laughing] [sniffs] Your blood smells weak, but I have not fed in a very long, long time. So I will sacrifice my own palate in order to satiate the nerving hunger building inside of me. - [screaming] - [screaming] [growling] [laughing] Now I will not crave his blood tonight. [shower running] ♪ I’m crushed and lonely ♪ ♪ It cannot be the end of ♪ ♪ ’Cause I won’t-- ♪ [wolf whistle] [chuckles] Yeah, right. No calls. What time is it? Nearly 9:00. So, uh, what are you guys gonna do? I don’t know. It happened really fast. - I’ll say. - What’s that supposed to mean? Nothing. I mean, neither of us know this guy very well, and I’ve never seen him around campus before. He’s extending the proverbial olive branch, trying to meet new people. Right. Except that he didn’t invite me. Are you jealous? No, of course not. - Don’t be stupid. - [phone ringing] Hello? Are you outside? Do you wanna come in? Okay. I’ll be right out. Wait. He’s been sitting outside? Don’t wait up for me, okay? [chuckles] Well, have fun. Don’t forget we have classes tomorrow. Thanks, Dad. - Good evening. - Hey, there. - Nice night, huh? - Even better now. You didn’t have to do that. It would do my mother proud to see I have not totally abandoned all of my upbringing. Wouldn’t want to disappoint your mother, would we? So tell me a few things about yourself. You get right to the point. I’m sorry. I’m always bad with breaking the ice. I just jump right in, hoping to avoid any awkwardness. How about I just hit you with a blizzard of questions, and you can answer which ones you feel comfortable? Sounds fair, only if I can do the same. Where are you from? Ohio. Oh, you’re a long way from home. That was kind of the point. Why is that? I just wanted to get away from the whole Midwestern world. I wish I understood what that meant. I was the all-star swim champ in a small town. I was kind of treated like a god. That doesn’t sound too bad. It got very demanding, very tiring. It just wasn’t my thing. The perfect all-American boy. Something like that. Okay. Next question. What’s the story with you and your roommate? Paul? I answered an online ad for a roommate. We started sending e-mails back and forth. I really don’t know that much about him. And you trust him enough to move into his home. He seems harmless enough. He seems...nice. I probably shouldn’t. Don’t wanna put on the freshman 15. You look great. Thanks. So let me ask you a question. Um, what’s your last name? Gavlin. And where are you from? Ah, that’s two questions. Just playing catch-up. Fair enough. I have been all over, but I was born in London. No accent? No. My family moved to the States when I was only two. Not enough time to develop the accent. Are you going to be swimming for the school? No interest. Purely academic. The other three guys-- who are they? Just some very close friends. We have been together a long time. Uh, they are like brothers to me. It’s good to have a close circle of friends. And Tara? She and I have been dating for several months now. Uh, but I wanna know more about Caleb-- Caleb... Donovan. Caleb Donovan. Well, there’s not much to tell. I really just wanna focus on school while I’m here. Graduate, good job, uh, make the most out of life. Travel, the whole nine yards. That sounds like the perfect plan. I have my own plan for the future. Really? What is that? Maybe we’ll save that for another time. I had a really great time tonight. As did I. So I’ll see you tomorrow? I believe that is possible. Um, see you tomorrow. - Hey. - Hey. How was your morning? - Not bad so far. Yours? - Just a few pages. Nothing major. Yeah. It’s already the first few days of class, and they’re starting full force, huh? - So what’s for lunch? - I don’t know, but I was thinking of something nice and greasy. - Cafeteria food’s pretty lame. - Yeah. Do you wanna go off campus? No. I have another class in 20 minutes. Okay. Well, maybe this evening. Dinner? Yeah. A big greasy hamburger, French fries, double-chocolate shake. That’ll take a few days to work off. Well, I’m gonna go to the house. I’ll see you later. - [Caleb] So glad this day is over. - Yeah. No shit. - Jasin! - Oh, boy. Caleb, I was looking for you today. Hey. I didn’t see you in class this morning. Would you mind if I borrow him for a few hours this evening? Um, we kind of already have plans. I promise to have him back before midnight. We did have plans to go to dinner. You know what? It’s okay. Go. I mean, we’ll catch up later. Are you sure? I mean, we did have plans first. It’s fine. I have some work to get started on anyways. Have fun. Hop in. [gunshot] [Men muttering] [muttering continues] [gunshot] It’s so peaceful here. Yes. One of my favorite places. I had a really nice time last night. As did I. I was hoping it would’ve lasted much longer. I guess I’m rather selfish that way. Nothing wrong with that. Paul doesn’t seem too pleased with me. Why do you say that? I get a sense he is not a fan. I’m sorry you feel that way. Don’t be sorry. Ah. - [metallic clank] - Ah. Yeah. [mutters] Jasin! - Did I hit something? - You-- You hit something. Go, go, go. Shit. Shit. Are you all right? - We’re fine. - You sure, man? We were shooting cans, and, you know, a stray bullet went off. - No harm done. - Jasin, I saw. You are free to inspect me if it will make you feel better. Okay. So-- So we’re cool? - Yes. - You’re all right? No need for further apologies. We’re fine. We’re all good. All righty. I’m fine. You got hit. I saw you get hit. It’s what you think you saw. Go ahead. You will find not a mark on me. It all happened so fast. However, I do feel this has put a strain on the afternoon. I should say so. Come. I’ll take you home. - Surfing? - Hey. Um, sort of. How much do you really know about Jasin? Don’t start that again. It’s getting a little old. No, I’m serious. Look, I appreciate your protective nature, but I’m a big boy. But how much do we know about him? Indulge me. Okay. He’s not a California native. He’s 20 years old. He likes long walks on the beach and puppy dogs and rainbows. - What do you want me to say? - Look, I’m fucking serious. Come on. I mean, I went through the school directory online. I couldn’t find anything for a Jason Gavlin. He doesn’t have a Facebook page, and I couldn’t find him on Google. Do you hear yourself? What is this paranoia? I don’t have a Facebook page. Does that mean there’s something wrong with me? No. I mean, I’m just worried, okay? Well, you don’t have to be. Jasin’s a good guy, and I like hanging out with him. - I’m sorry if you don’t feel the same way. - But I’m concerned. - You’re getting too close too fast. - That is none of your business. - You don’t understand. - That’s because you aren’t making any sense. Wait a minute. You’re jealous, aren’t you? Jealousy has nothing to do with it. You’re full of shit. You can’t stand the fact that I’m hanging out with Jasin and you’re not. You are jealous. You know what? I am jealous. I’m jealous of him and jealous it’s not me spending all that time with you. - What’s your fucking problem? - It should be me, not him. Look, it’s just not like that with us, okay? We’re just friends and roommates. But we could be more. I mean, what is so fucking special about Jasin, huh? Why are you so drawn to him? It’s none of your business. - Why can’t you just be my friend? - I have friends. This is too much. I have to go. Please don’t leave. Let’s talk about this. This is too intense for me. I have to clear my head. Then go find your precious Jasin. I mean, I hope you two will be very happy together. Why don’t you just go live with him? That’s a good idea. When you come back, your stuff will be packed. [muttering] Ohh! Paul is becoming a very big problem for Caleb. You want us to pay him a visit? [Jasin] Caleb has left the house. He’s angry, confused. I will not have him feeling this way. What do you want us to do? I need to find Caleb. It’s time he knew the truth about me. And you’re sure he’s the one? Make it clean. Penny for your thoughts. Hey. You look a little upset. Everything okay? Anything I can do? Keep me company. Did something happen? Paul and I had a fight. You’re right. He’s not a big fan of yours. Told you so. He crossed a line today-- one I didn’t wanna cross with him. Things are just a little confusing for me right now. How can I make it better? Your being here makes it better. I am pleased to hear that. Caleb? I wanna apologize. Caleb! Caleb! [sighs] Are you leaving already? You just got here. Hey-- Hey, guys. Um, have you seen Caleb? He’s occupied at the moment. You’ve become a little bit of a problem for Jasin. - [chuckling] - What do you mean? You should’ve stayed away from Caleb. Look, Caleb’s my friend. I’m trying to find him to apologize. Well, he’s more than that to Jasin. Yeah. We will not allow you to stand in their way.

I can handle complex situations. I’m sure you are more than capable. Something wrong? I just don’t think things are working out with Paul. You’re-- You’re right. He’s not a big fan of yours. I was not put on this earth to please everyone. I can live with that. He freaked out on me. He started going off about how you’re not in the school directory and stuff like that. He does know that hacking is a punishable offense, right? He kissed me. Did you kiss him back? No. Well, his lips were on mine, so I suppose so. What I mean is, when he kissed you, did you accept it? No, I pulled away. Then you did not kiss him back. I suppose so. Let me show you what I mean. What the hell was that? I’m sorry. I did not mean to be so quick about revealing my secret to you. I suppose I just could not resist. You truly have no idea you are the one. What the fuck are you talking about? Like I said, it’s really complicated, but you need to know the truth. I am... You are what? Even if I tell you the truth, your mind will not be able to comprehend it. You said you wanted me to know. Tell me. It’s more complicated than just blurting the word-- I don’t care. You tell me the truth. I am a vampire. What? What? - What the hell are you talking about? - If you’ll let me explain-- Like I said, it’s complicated. Please, if you will let me explain. No. Stay away from me. No... Shit. [vampires laughing] [howling] Whoo-hoo-hoo! - [howling] - Yeah! - Burn, baby! - [mutters] Did you take care of Paul? Would you expect anything less? It’s amazing how some humans burn. I do not find that the least bit comical. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry, Jasin. By the look on your face, I can see that he didn’t accept the truth. What makes you believe I divulged anything to him? Oh, you slept with him. The way you’ve been going on and on about this connection that you have... You love him. And you told him, didn’t you? I did. Let me guess. He had the exact same reaction that Cassandra did. Cassandra accepted the initial idea of being with a vampire. It’s still unclear to me as to what changed with her. What about Tara? You were convinced that she was the one before Caleb was even in the picture. What happened? This decision is greater than any other I’ve been forced to make. I must be sure to choose wisely... with my heart. Are you sure that’s what you’re choosing with? - What are you implying? - Logan, you know that Jasin is sincere. He’s not just thinking with his dick. Let a vampire be in love. If he’s not, then we’ll all soon perish. I do not wanna think about that. He will make the right decision. Mind your own business, both of you. I have been through this with him more times than you can count. We’ve all been part of this coven for many, many years. We stand behind Jasin and his decision. Thank you for your loyalty. Caleb...is a phase. Tara’s the one you’re supposed to be with. You know that. I believe that decision is left up to me, is it not? Jasin, I know how you feel about Caleb. I know that you think that he is the one. But how can you be sure? You’ve only known him for a few days. Are you challenging me, Logan? I do not wanna die because you can’t figure out who you wanna spend eternity with. But I don’t have a choice. You created me, and I perish when you do. I agree that it is not fair, but I did not write the rules. I am bound to them more so than any of you. Then why don’t you just make Tara one tonight? - She’s ready to be turned, and-- - Enough discussion. Evening, boys. Did I come at a bad time? Everything is as it should be. How are you this evening? Come on, guys. Why don’t we give them their privacy? Something wrong with Logan? Nothing at all. So, are you going to make me a vampire tonight or what? Not tonight. Soon, I hope? I will follow you to the ends of the earth. Paul? Paul? [mutters] [clatter] [sighs] What the hell? Ow. Damn it. [Jasin] I didn’t mean to startle you. And I’m sorry about the pot. I wasn’t sure how to get your attention. Shouldn’t you be in a pile of dust or something? You’d be surprised how many myths are false. Like the myth about vampires existing? Yes. Well, I can assure you, that one is true. How’s that? Can we talk? Do vampires drink coffee? I would love some. I thought you said you’d love a cup. I’m on my third already. I’m sorry. That is rude of me. It must be stone-cold by now. It’s okay. I really do not need it. I do not sleep. Okay. So, let’s say I believed you. What is a vampire doing in California? The sun would destroy you, wouldn’t it? As I said earlier, that’s just a myth. Only the elder vampires are affected by the sun. Elder vampires? There is so much to tell. I will get to that. Well, where are your fangs? What, are you saying that’s a myth, too? No. Fangs are a necessity. Shit. So, why didn’t you suck my blood? I mean, don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to be alive. But... Shall I start from the beginning? They say that’s the best place. I’ll condense some of the details. The story is as old as I. How old are you? I am forever frozen at the age of 20. However, I have walked the earth as a vampire for nearly 100 years. I’m all ears. Uh, nearly 100 years ago, an elder vampire named Naran found me near death, lying in a street. I do not even remember the city, state or country I’m from. I remember his eyes, and then the pain of his fangs in my neck. And the years passed. He and I were together as one. He filled my head with stories of the elder vampires and their legends. He taught me everything about being a vampire. He taught me to hunt. And he taught me about love. Have you-- Have you ever killed? Another truth among the myths. Yes, vampires are sustained by human blood. We can survive on animals but only for so long. You said he taught you about love. Yes. I was Naran’s chosen one. In order to stay immortal, an elder must choose a companion, another who will complete them. Like yin and yang, if you will. And you were his chosen one. I was for a time. As an elder vampire, Naran would not be satisfied with only one mortal. Even after he turned me, he was not fulfilled. He found another and turned her into a vampire. What happened to him? I have no idea. He left me in England, and I have not seen him since. So, you think I’m your chosen one? Yes. See, because I was turned by an elder, I must do the same or I will not survive. But I thought that vampires were immortal. I mean, you are over 100 years old. Very true. However, without a companion, upon our 100th vampire year, we cease to exist. That’s a new one to add to the list. Yes. Odd as it is, it is very true. What about mirrors? You think this hair gets this way on its own? A mirror does help. - Crosses? - As you can see, I’ve always been partial to their religious significance. Garlic? Myth. Stake through the heart? You saw that a bullet did not pierce my skin. Do you really think a sharpened piece of wood could do the trick? Point taken. As for the sun, we hybrids still have some traces of human blood, so we’re not affected by its rays. I don’t make the rules. Dane, Adam, and Logan are also not affected. I created them. They’re vampires, too. We’re a small coven. I needed companions, and they have been aiding in my journey for my eternal mate. Pretty tight group. Very much so. So... Yes? How do you kill a vampire? Why? Do you wanna kill me? No. Decapitation is the only sure way. Decapitation. Uh... So what will happen to me? Are you going to turn me? Uh, yes, it has come to that. I will not force you. If you feel for me the way I feel for you, you will choose to be with me forever. And if not? Tara is aware of my true self. She was to be the one originally. What happened? Truth be told, you happened. I cannot explain it, but you have this tremendous pull over me. So I would become a vampire. Yes, that is the idea. This is all too much. First, Paul goes missing, and now this. How long do I have to decide? My 100th year as a vampire is tomorrow, midnight. Are you kidding? I have to decide in that short amount of time? I will not force you to make any decision you do not want to. Look, I am aware of the weight of all this. That is why I’m giving you the choice. The choice I never had. You truly have no idea the impact you’ve had on me. This is all happening so fast. Why don’t you take a few hours to think things over? I will honor your decision either way. A few hours. I will leave you to your thoughts. Wait. There’s so much to think about. How... What? I’m sorry for how quickly this all came about. I wish there was more time. Can I call you tonight? That would be perfect. [sighs] You seem angry about something. You’re being foolish. How is that? You’re not thinking clearly. Tara is the one. I chose her myself. You were happy with her. Yes, but my heart knew differently. I cannot explain it. So you’ve said. You’re being ridiculous. Your time, my time is almost over. I’m aware of what could happen. If Caleb decides this is too much for him, I will accept Tara as the one and turn her tomorrow. Why can’t you do it now? Why must you wait till the last possible minute? It is my decision. I am aware of the ramifications. We die, too! You know that, right? This is not just about you. I think you should calm down. [Logan] How am I supposed to calm down when my life’s in danger? Caleb is a plaything. Tara is the one. Why? Because you say she is? [hisses] Are you sure you wanna go there? What’s the problem, guys? I’m not afraid of you. You do not want to die now, do you? [chuckling] Are you threatening me? You initiated this, and I will gladly finish it. [hisses] - Back away. - Let’s not lose our heads. Logan, if Caleb is the one that Jasin wants, let it be. Jasin is willing to let us die for a piece of meat. Break it up. Now. This isn’t over. This can’t be good. He just needs to calm down. Do you think he meant it-- it not being over? Is-- Is he gonna try something? I cannot be certain. [answering machine beeps] Hey, Jasin, it’s Caleb. Um, I just really would like to see you. Can you come over when you get his? Did I keep you waiting? Were you out here the whole time? I was across town. Serious? Another perk of being a vampire. What’s wrong? You have to invite me in. - Really? - I know. Another very old vampire myth. However, it is one of the few we hybrids must follow. But you were in my backyard. That was outdoors. It was not where you live. I don’t make the rules. I invite you in. Have you given any more thought to our earlier discussion? I have, but I’ve been a little distracted. Paul isn’t answering his phone. I think he’s ignoring me. Didn’t you two have a fight? You could say that, but it seems a little unlike him. You haven’t known him that long. Maybe it is just like him. So, about our earlier conversation. There’s just so much to consider. What are your feelings for me? It’s funny. I’ve never felt this way about anyone, ever. I feel the same. What about Tara? If she truly were the one, I would not be here right now. Would you give yourself to me freely? I... [knock at door] What’s going on? - Big trouble. - That’s putting it mildly. What are you both talking about? Logan has completely lost it. - What’s going on? - Hey, Caleb. - So, ready to become one of us? - Stay focused, Dane. - What has happened? What’s Logan done? - Logan has taken Tara. He sent us to find you. If you don’t meet him tonight in the meadow, he’s gonna kill her, and he’s gonna hunt you down and kill you, too. What? Wait. No. Sorry, man. We don’t have enough time to explain. Oh, you should’ve seen him. We couldn’t stop him. He’s more powerful than either of us. May they come in? Yes, of course. You can both come in. - Logan has taken this too far. - You should’ve seen the look in his eyes. - Oh, darker than normal. - I will not fight him unless I must. I cannot let him harm Tara. Is he more powerful than you? I don’t wanna lose you. I created Logan. He was my first transformation. He is a very powerful vampire. - He threw Adam through a tree. - It didn’t hurt. Stay focused, guys. If he wants me to meet him, so be it. You must stay behind. Bullshit. I’m not staying here. You are a stubborn one, aren’t you? Damn straight. I don’t wanna lose you. Don’t worry, Jasin. We’ll help protect him. If we don’t die in the process. I do not think that Logan means to hurt Tara. It is more than likely a plot to get Caleb. Caleb is the true target. You must stay here. So be it. [crying] It does not have to be this way. Look what you did. Poor Tara. She’s heartbroken. I think she’s more frightened of you at the moment. I don’t wanna die. [crying] How can you choose him... ...over her? She’s so perfect and beautiful. I can smell her blood. It’s so sweet. Maybe I’ll drain her right here... before I kill him. Try to stay calm, Tara. He will not harm you. Don’t count on it. [grunting] [panting] I don’t want to kill you. You don’t have a choice. Either you kill me or I’ll kill him. Then I’ll burn your body. [yells] You caused this! You caused this! [grunts] You leave me no choice. [grunting] Is she gonna be okay? Her heartbeat is slowing. She will be one of us before the night is over. Can I say the same for you? As you can see, I will do anything for you. Will you die to live forever? Will you die to live forever with me?
