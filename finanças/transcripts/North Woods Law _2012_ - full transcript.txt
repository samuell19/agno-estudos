There was blood being dragged over top the wall, Indicating the bear climbed over from one property to the next. The hunter followed right over. At this location, there's no posted signs Indicating that there's no hunting, No trespassing allowed. As soon as the hunter got the bear out to the road, He realized that the property was posted.

Then I'll follow you back to your house. I can walk right down with you and we'll take off. My thoughts right now is I kind of have to Contact the landowner, see how he feels about it. If the landowner does not want him to be on the property, I will cite him for trespass.
