SUGA: What worries me right now is that there's nothing I want to talk about. Right now, there is nothing... (CHUCKLES) ...that I'd like to talk about. (PEN SCRIBBLING) SUGA: And that makes me so sad. There were so many stories I wanted to tell. -(CROWD CHEERS) -Did I lose them because I've achieved so much? Sort of like dreams, you know? Did I forget about them because so many of them already came true? I mean, why... (HIGH-PITCHED WINDING) ("SO FAR AWAY" BY AGUST D PLAYS) SUGA: It's my first time walking down this street. I'm still so excited. After concerts, I'd always be like, "I'm so tired!" It's my first time doing this! (LAUGHING) Even in Korea, I've never done this before. SUGA: I knew for sure that the mixtape was going to have three parts. -(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYS) -Because in D-1, I had to express a lot of my insecurities. Because if I didn't, I felt like I had no reason to be a member of BTS. After sorting out my problems, I made D-2 and tried to talk about the past and the present. Now, on this album, I really wanted to deliver a message about all those things in general. What's more, this is my album. And it's not by SUGA... it's by Agust D. No one knows who Agust D is. (LAUGHING) Only my fans do. "Who's this Agust D person?" When "Daechwita" came out, they were like, "He looks a lot like SUGA." Are they going to understand what I'm trying to say? Even I'm confused. So I feel a lot of pressure. Honestly, when I was working on this album, I wondered if it may be the last piece of work under the name "Agust D." (GUNSHOT) (RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) Oh, the title song? I finished it. (CHUCKLES) But I don't like it. (LAUGHS) I thought Las Vegas was a hot place... all year round. (RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYING) (SENTIMENTAL GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS) (MUSIC STOPS) (HUMS) I'm thinking of... -sampling "Around Thirty"... -(TYPING) ...to make a new song. (SOFT GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING) (SOFT ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYS) (DRUMS BEATING) (MUSIC STOPS) (RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYS) PRODUCER: Why did you choose that song in particular? Because I'm 30. (LAUGHS) I thought it would give me a lot of things to write about. The things you can do... when you're 30. There must be tons. -(RAIN FALLING) -(RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYING) SUGA: They were talking about BTS breaking up. -(RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYING) -That was when I had just turned 30. I started talking about making my own album. (RAPPING) I mean, going solo and doing our own things, there's nothing wrong with it if you think about it. -We should've done it ages ago. -(MUSIC PLAYS) But we didn't, and it just got delayed. If my memory is correct, the articles about us breaking up were on the front page of portal websites for two weeks. Seeing all those negative reactions... IS YOUR JUSTICE JUST? ...to ideas we were only considering made it hard for me to accept what people were thinking about us. I ended up with a song that I didn't originally have in mind, but it's gonna help me write something fresher for "Thirty." It's always been like this. None of my songs come out according to plan. (LAUGHS) They always turn out to be something unexpected, and I just go along with it. I used to be like, "This is my only passion." But now that I'm here... -(DRUMS BEATING) -...I'm doing all these other things. (SUGA CHUCKLING) You don't have to be so single-minded.

Last time I was here, there wasn't time for me to do the things I wanted to do. But this time, I plan to see my friends while I'm here. I'm gonna see Halsey, Chris, and Steve Aoki. What should I talk about when I see him? He's a really nice guy, and he tried to help us in any way he could. I think it's because he's Asian. Why does he have pictures of us? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) SUGA: What's going on? How does he have this? Did he put this up just for me? It's new. (IN ENGLISH) Dude, it's so good to see you. -SUGA: (IN ENGLISH) Long time no see. -Yeah, I know. How are you? -Oh, yeah. I'm gonna give you a tour. -Mm-hmm.

(SUGA EXCLAIMS) (IN ENGLISH) Hold on, hold on one second. I got a present for you. This is a One-Of-One jacket. (SUGA EXCLAIMS) STEVE: That's cool. Like, this whole neighborhood is... is gonna boom. Yeah, this is a brand-new home. SUGA's home. -TRANSLATOR: Yeah! -(ALL LAUGHING) STEVE: No, I got everything. I got, like, my MIDI drums. And then you can plug in guitar and bass. (IN KOREAN) The brightest studio I've ever seen. Most studios are pitch black, this is the brightest one I've ever seen. STEVE: (IN ENGLISH) Yeah, everything's custom. So, originally, I had my Focals here. I switched them out. -Ocean Way. -Focal? -No, that's an Ocean Way. -Okay. Same company, custom. (FAST ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) Whoo! -Thank you, yeah. -Nice. -It's more like... Like, this album... -SUGA: Mm-hmm. It's still mixing like... pop and, you know, hip-hop and stuff. But I'm... But I'm like doing a lot more of, like, rock. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) STEVE: What are you working on musically? Like, what kind of music... Can you play some? (IN KOREAN) Some of them are almost finished... STEVE: (IN ENGLISH) Oh, okay. Alright. Cool. (INTENSE HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS) (SPEAKING INAUDIBLY) (MELLOW HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS) STEVE: Let's do this one. Beautiful song. Oh my god. Beautiful song. (IN KOREAN) Next time... Um, next time I visit Las Vegas, I'm gonna have to use this studio. (TRANSLATOR INTERPRETS) (IN ENGLISH) Yes! Oh, good, good. Yeah. It's a good vibe in here, man. It's a good vibe. I don't have any clocks. We work whenever we want. Feels like anytime, you know. I'm happy just to give it, give you guys all my resources, to just help with your... make it as easy as possible. Every floor! SUGA: (IN KOREAN) He's tried hard to please his guest. (LAUGHTER) SUGA: Oh, these aren't photos. They're paintings. STEVE: (IN ENGLISH) I'm a true supporter, you know. Alright, brother. I'll see you tonight, okay? -See you soon. -Alright, man. -MAN: Thank you, guys. Thank you. -See you, guys. (IN KOREAN) I haven't had this kind of fun in a while. I mean, I often collaborate with musicians and we listen to each other's music in Korea as well, but... Um, I love how Steve set his studio up. I also loved the songs. I really liked the one with Lil Uzi. -STEVE: (IN ENGLISH) It's next year. -PRODUCER: Next year? STEVE: But we can play you some stuff. Well, SUGA's a musical genius. You know, he's definitely one of my favorite artists to work with. And, uh... I think he's... He's also very forward-thinking. You know, like, whenever I hear, like, his own, 'cause... You know, obviously, you have SUGA as BTS, and SUGA on his own. -("DAECHWITA" PLAYS) -STEVE: And when I listen to his music on his own, he's always doing something I would never expect. And, uh... So I always expect the highest bar from SUGA.

I haven't done much work. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) How long does it take to see the Red Rock Canyon? PRODUCER: Not long. SUGA: Oh, then we should get there for when the sun goes down. I bet it's beautiful during sunset. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) MAN: Mm! I need to lose weight when I get back. I had... (LAUGHS) ...three meals today. And I think that's a first in 18 months. I've grown up quicker than others. But I didn't want to grow up. What I wanted was to keep dreaming. I used to tell the BTS members, "You become an adult the moment you stop dreaming." I used to say that. And I don't have any dreams now. Now I ask myself, "What do I need to dream of?" We did what we wanted and what we had to do to get here, and in 2018, I was told that I'd been chosen to represent this generation. I never thought of it that way. (CAMERA SHUTTERS) SUGA: I never thought, "Hey, I'm Asian." "So I'm going to head over to America and top the Billboard chart for my fellow Asians." -MAN: Can I give you a hug? -SUGA: Sure. (LAUGHS) Thanks. You've made things a lot better. -SUGA: Oh, really? -MAN: Yeah. -SUGA: That's nice. -MAN: You've made your country proud. -SUGA: Thank you. -MAN: I'm honored. -SUGA: Thanks, that's good to hear. -MAN: Yeah. SUGA: I didn't mean to make Korea proud. (PRODUCER LAUGHING) SUGA: But when I travel overseas, I hear that so often from the Korean immigrants living there. A lot of them are business owners too. I told you when we were having dinner. Danny's family. They are all Asians. The restaurant owner is Asian. -It feels good when I see them happy. -(PRODUCER HUMS IN RESPONSE) (SIGHS) What should I do? I've run out of stories to tell, but I have to tell one. SUGA: Yesterday was so tiring. I had so many things to do. But I'm sure I'll wake up when we arrive, right? That's what sightseeing is about, getting dragged around like a zombie. (LAUGHS) I know we travelled to nice places while shooting BTS BON VOYAGE... but I've never seen anything more awe-inspiring than this. -(SOFT MUSIC PLAYS) -(SUGA EXCLAIMS) SUGA: How do they make such a straight line? SERVER: Order. I've been on just one... (CLEARS THROAT) ...one overseas trip with my family. I was in fifth grade? Sixth grade? A place called Zhangjiajie in China. That was my last trip. I haven't been on a trip since. This is my first trip since my debut other than the ones I've gone on for shoots. I thought I didn't enjoy traveling around. That's why I never went anywhere. -No one was stopping me, you know? -PRODUCER: (LAUGHING) I get it. (SNIFFLES) Even when I got a long-term vacation last time, I just worked on my album, my mixtape. So why am I shackling myself when no one's telling me to? (SNIFFLES) I think it's really nice to travel. ("MERRY CHRISTMAS, MR. LAWRENCE" BY RYUICHI SAKAMOTO PLAYS) (SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) (PLAYING "MERRY CHRISTMAS, MR. LAWRENCE" ) SUGA: After a certain point, I think I started to lose my preferences and my favorite things. When I turned 20, I thought, "What are my twenties gonna be like? It's gonna be so fun." When I think about my thirties, I see nothing. If you want to write lyrics or a song, you have to be hooked on something. You need to think about it constantly, and then write those thoughts into words. What do you do when you're over 30? (CHUCKLES) Do I have to keep working? I don't think I can keep this up anymore. PRODUCER: You can't. This is my first proper trip away, and I just realized that trips are fun. (LAUGHS) Now I need to think about how to keep having this fun in my life. We're heading to my friend Halsey's place. WOMAN: (IN ENGLISH) Hey, happy birthday! -HALSEY: Hi! -SUGA: Hey, how do you do? How are you? -WOMAN: How are you? -Hey, how are you? What can I get you... I'll go get you guys some drinks. What do you want to drink? You know this fish? No! -That's a real fish? -Yeah. -...blue, it looks like a... -(INDISTINCT CHATTER) Gya… Gyapardos? -Was that the fish? -HALSEY: Gyarados! Gyarados! That's it. -SUGA: Gyarados. -WOMAN: Kind of like Avatar. Oh my god, I'm so nervous! (LAUGHS) -(IN KOREAN) You should shoot this. -(LAUGHS) -Okay, okay. -MAN: I was about to be like... I'm gonna do my best. -(MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND) -Pretty good. There you go. -(BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER) -(LAUGHTER) -MAN: But it's not bad! -Selfie! HALSEY: (LAUGHING) It's terrible! SUGA: (IN KOREAN) They are pop stars. The pop stars that we all saw when we were growing up, they're people just like us. I'm aware that some people don't like us. I mean, we're a boy band. Some of the things that we've done might not mean as much to them. Despite the fact that we're putting out a lot of work. But the pop stars were among the ones who understood us and saw us for who we are, and paid no attention to all the hate. They treated us as human beings. We may not speak the same language, but we get each other. My followers will be confused when they see this. (TURNTABLE SCRATCHING) He just invited me. (LAUGHS) So I'm just gonna go and see. I was curious about his studio. -SUGA: (IN ENGLISH) Hi. -ANDERSON: Hi! Good to see you, what's up! Good to see you, bro! It's good! Yo, what up, man? (RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYING) (IN KOREAN) When we first met, he kissed me on my forehead. TRANSLATOR: (IN ENGLISH) You kissed him when you first saw him. I kissed you? I was so drunk. -(ALL LAUGHING) -(IN KOREAN) Sorry. (IN ENGLISH) Sorry. (SMOOCHES) My baby! (IN KOREAN) Baby! (KNOCKS) (IN ENGLISH) Sit in it. Watch your head. Oh, shit! (LAUGHTER) -(IN KOREAN) So random! -(CHEERFUL MUSIC PLAYING) ANDERSON: (IN ENGLISH) ...play some stuff. Yeah, yeah. I got the beat, uh, that you sent me too. Right? (ENERGETIC MUSIC PLAYING) -(FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING) -(EXCLAIMS) Crazy! -(TRANSLATOR INTERPRETS) -Did you bring some stuff? (IN KOREAN) Do I need to play mine? (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYS) (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) (IN ENGLISH) Sick. (IN KOREAN) I came to America to do some work, but all I do is drink. (IN ENGLISH) Man, but that's part of it. See... (LAUGHS) -SUGA: Soju! -ANDERSON: Want some soju? -SUGA: (IN KOREAN) This is soju! -ANDERSON: Yeah. SUGA: (IN ENGLISH) Made in New York? Why? (IN KOREAN) It's soju. -ANDERSON: (IN ENGLISH) Yeah. -SUGA: Cheers. -(LAUGHTER) -ANDERSON: Yeah! -SUGA: Yeah. -ANDERSON: To the life. Ah, that's better. Are you 21? How old are you? -TRANSLATOR: He's 29. -ANDERSON: Really? ANDERSON: (IN KOREAN) Really? -ANDERSON: (IN ENGLISH) Twenty-nine? -Yeah, 29. ANDERSON: Oh, you're old. Okay, cool! -(LAUGHTER) -ANDERSON: Grown man! Hell, yeah! I thought you were a kid! (CHUCKLES) MAN: (IN KOREAN) He asked if you were 21. ANDERSON: (IN ENGLISH) Thought you were a little baby. Twenty-one? (IN KOREAN) This is gonna be fun. I can feature in his song. ANDERSON: (IN ENGLISH) Gold! -SUGA: (IN ENGLISH) I'm factory. -ANDERSON: You're a factory machine? -Machine. -(INDISTINCT CHATTER) ("MOONLIGHT" BY AGUST D PLAYS) (SPEAKING INAUDIBLY) MAN: (IN KOREAN) He backed out at first. Now, look at him go. -SUGA: Whoo! Yeah! -(IN ENGLISH) Man, have a good one. ANDERSON: My man. -Hell, yeah. Yes, I will. Yes, I will. -Yeah, yeah. SUGA: (IN KOREAN) He's an angel, just like Halsey. (CHUCKLES) Wait, you've hardly caught any footage of me working. I suck at working when the camera's on. (CHUCKLES) But... Maybe I could even try working like this back in Korea. I think it would work. I bet I could find some fun people to work with, but... You might have noticed back there that I'm a bit... I'm a bit shy. (LAUGHS) He's a really good guy. -(TURNTABLE SCRATCHING) -("GIVE IT TO ME" BY AGUST D PLAYS) (MUSIC ENDS) (SIGHS) Right now... I have to work on... Anderson .Paak's song. I feel like I've taken on more jobs than I can handle. I've been stressed in the past too, -but there was a time limit. -(RAPPING) I just get bored when I don't work. I tried taking a month or two off, but then I got bored and went back to work anyway. You see, a musician's career doesn't last that long. They say that an idol singer's career lasts seven years, but it's hard to find a musician who is at their prime for more than seven years. (SIGHS) Until I finish? It's only been 11 hours. Music is consumed so quickly these days, it moves on so fast... that's why I'm working so much... (LAUGHS) ...they forget about you quickly. (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYS) SUGA: After working with lots of different artists, you get the hang of finding out what style they want and how to cater to their needs. I also want the listeners to listen to my songs... Whoo! ...and think... SUGA: Aw... ...that SUGA? He's not a bad producer. So this idea of proving myself is one of the things that's on my mind right now. But then, when I think about how much more I should do, I run out of things to say. I'm struggling, in my own way... to push through this. This is my life. I can't back out. (IN ENGLISH) It's good. It's worth it. It's gon' be worth it. -ANDERSON: (IN KOREAN) I love you. -(LAUGHTER) (IN ENGLISH) My fave. (IN KOREAN) I love you! (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES) I don't quite know how to say how I feel, but I am sure of one thing... I want to get recognized for doing what I do. To get recognized for my work. If you were to ask me how much work I've done whilst I've been in America... Well, I wrote the "Around Thirty" song. Other than that, I just hummed some tunes, that's all. (LAUGHS) But I think by going to different places, I've managed to work on my feelings. To be honest, I didn't have to go to Chris's studio or Anderson's studio. If I really wanted to get some work done, I'd have felt more comfortable just going back to Korea right away. But America makes the best music in the world, and it's at the top when it comes to pop music, so I've always wanted to know what kind of environment these artists are working in. Peace of mind? -(MUSIC STOPS) -(BELLS RINGING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (TINKLING SOUND EFFECT) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (EXHALES) (GRUNTS) (SPEAKER SCREECHES) (DRUMS BEATING SLOWLY) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) (MUSIC STOPS) (SUGA MUTTERS) MAN: You've slimmed down again. SUGA: What? -MAN: You've slimmed down again. -Again? (EXHALES LOUDLY) Yes. -Shall we start this meeting? -MAN: Okay. The title of the album is D-Day. This one's called D-Day. You might have expected D-3 to be released after D-2, but it's D-Day. So, there will be two music videos. One of them will be for a song called "Haegeum." There's another song that we need to make a video for, and it's called "AMYGDALA." And what it means is... It's a part of the brain. When you're in certain situations, ones that can be traumatic, it really... JIMIN: Yo. Yeah, I'm almost done. I finished writing the lyrics. -(SONG PLAYS AND STOPS) -JIMIN: Heard you're recording furiously. -Huh? -JIMIN: You're recording furiously. I'm not furious. JIMIN: Oh, I didn't mean it like that. ("AMYGDALA" PLAYS) (MUSIC STOPS) -SUGA: Wanna hear it? -JIMIN: Yeah. It's really good. It's my favorite song out of the recent ones I wrote. ("AMYGDALA" PLAYS) -(MUSIC STOPS) -JIMIN: It's nice. It's called "AMYGDALA." JIMIN: "AMYGDALA"? There's a thing called an amygdala. Your brain stores all of your unpleasant memories in the amygdala. So you can prepare yourself for those types of situations in the future. I have massive mood swings whenever I'm working on this song. To work on it, I have to bring up some of my unpleasant memories. But this is actually a very important process. It's part of the treatment to bring back bad memories from your past and learn to control those memories. You get an instant reaction. For example, if you got bitten by a snake once, you become scared of snakes, so you learn to avoid them. That's how this part of the brain works to give us a better chance of survival. This is the story of my life, you know. Before I reached the age of 20, I'd already had a lot of things going on in my life. I really want to talk about how I got the scar over my eye in this song. In a way, we're responsible for all our own wounds and scars. No one can dodge the first arrow of trouble, of course, but when that second arrow flies at you, you've chosen to just stand there and get hit, rather than learn from the first time. That's what I wanted to talk about when I was writing "AMYGDALA." So... That's the message I'm trying to get across.

Hello, everyone. Let's start by introducing ourselves. -MAN 1: Let's do this. -MAN 2: Yes! The reason I brought us here is because I can't seem to write any songs. I'm kind of in a slump. After collaborating with PSY, my brain just stopped. I thought I could use some rest. MAN 3: What if we end up not working? (LAUGHS) I don't think there's anything wrong with that. -MAN 3: Oh, okay. -We can just have fun. You can go upstairs. Whenever an idea pops into your head, just come down and record it. -MAN 3: If I get an idea... -SUGA: Yes. Let it out. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (MAN LAUGHING) I should take a picture of Jang Ijeong's back. You look kinda cool. (LAUGHS) -("PEOPLE" PLAYS) -That's a bit too... you know? -(RAIN FALLING) -(MUSIC CONTINUES) (PLAYS KEYBOARD) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) I haven't written songs this way in a long time. (MAN SINGING) (SINGS) (MUSIC CONTINUES) -(MAN LAUGHING) -Did you write it? (MUSIC FADES OUT) I think I should treat writing songs like a nine-to-five job. Some people are so creative that they drop a song in one go, but they're just born with that ability. I have to get some work done now or it's gonna drag me down at some point. If I don't do it now, it will make my life harder later. I might even miss the deadline. But if I have a song, I can simply incorporate something trendy and release it anytime. And you never know who you're gonna work with. I have no idea when my album will be out, so... I'm like, "Work now, think later." -(DRUMS BEATING) -SUGA: Try a different bass line. -(BASS PLAYS) -SUGA: No. I'm telling you to change the line, not the source. MAN: It's like a kid on a recorder. (LAUGHS) (LAIDBACK MUSIC PLAYING) (MAN SINGING) Be more aggressive. (MAN SINGING) (LAUGHS) Man, you sound just like Jung Kook! This has been the most fun session on this trip. (LAUGHS) It's the best! This, um... (MAN SINGING) Darn... (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (MAN SINGING) Hm. SUGA: I haven't been on the Internet lately. It's so easy for people to access all sorts of information. That's what D-Day actually means: the day we free ourselves from information. "I need to be better than him. I need to be better than her." That's just so exhausting. And excruciating. That's what's been driving me since I first started making music. But it's so tiring now. The day that we liberate ourselves from these negative thoughts, that's the starting point for this album. Because over the past two years, my life has been full of noise. Full of good things, and full of noise. And I didn't want the noise controlling me. In the hook... (HUMS) -There's this part. -MAN: Hm? It sounds like a guitar. -(MAN VOCALIZES) -SUGA: Mm-hmm. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) It'd be less stressful to just be a producer. What would I be doing if I hadn't become an idol? (INHALES) I miss my mom now. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHS) I'm like, "I need to see her right now," and I drive off. Just drive off. (SUGA HUMS) PRODUCER: What about work? I'm not sure what I'll be doing with the songs I'm writing here. Well, I'll try to focus on writing songs while I'm here. I'm serious. Not joking. I'm gonna try and finish this album. But if it's not done by the middle of next month, I'll wrap everything up here, take two cameras from you, and go into the mountains to finish it. -(PRODUCER LAUGHING) -I'm serious. Just by myself. -Let's keep going now. -(DRUMS BEATING) -MAN: This is the one from before. -Yeah. And? -Keep it coming. -(MUSIC PLAYING) It'd be even better to add that one to this track. This one's less noisy. Where is "ta-da-da"? Is it this one? It's the one underneath. When I'm making music... (CLEARS THROAT) ...I always think that this is just like the excretion process. -PRODUCER: Excretion? -It's excretion. To take the excrement and turn it into something beautiful is the next step. You have to let it all out first. After that, my job is to convince the world that it's something beautiful. But you have to push them out first. Then you clean them up when you're thinking straight. I've been saying this forever. It might sound good today, but it'll sound like crap tomorrow. To be honest, this is a very fun way to make music. But when I can't push anything out like today, it'd be great if someone came along and saved the day. Most of the time, that never happens. A good cleanup. That's what we need here. We have a cool beat, though. MAN 1: Cleanup is important. Cleanup... MAN 2: I feel like our work is piling up. (LAUGHS) We do cleanups all the time. We'll do well this time too. We'll do well. MAN 1: It's all good. I'm happy. ("PEOPLE" PLAYS) SUGA: We think about making it big, making money, buying watches and nice cars and everything, but none of those things are what makes your life fun. You might say, "Hey, you made it big, that's why you can say that." Yes, that's why I can tell you that they're not the fun part. But when I meet up with people and make music, that's fun. It makes me completely focused for 12, 13 hours, and only stop to eat. How many things can make you do that? That's happiness. I'm so fed up with music that I think about quitting hundreds of times a day. But then, when we meet up, I can work 12, 13 hours a day. That's how fun this can be. Making music can be so much fun. -But why does it have to be work? -(PLAYING KEYBOARD) SUGA: It's been so painful for me to make music lately. Collaborations are painful too. You might ask why I'm doing this. I'm doing this because... I don't want the BTS fans or my fans to feel bored.

Once I get sick of them, I just can't listen to them anymore. (MUSIC STOPS) After two or three years, that's when I start listening to them again. I love the song called "People" from my D-2 album. Sometimes, when life gets too hard, I listen to the song... (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYS) ...then I cry my eyes out. -("People Pt. 2" PLAYS) -That's the moment I start hearing the song as a listener would. "How did I write this?" I feel like "People" has given me a great deal of comfort. That's what it means to me. Comfort. So, for "People Pt. 2," I figured I'd make a song that has the same vibe as "People." And I wanted to put it on D-Day. I had "Saram Pt. 2" meaning "People Pt. 2" and "Sarang" meaning "Love" in mind. I also thought about naming it "Sara" and leaving it to the listeners to decide whether it means "people" or "love." Then I settled on "People Pt. 2." I have to shoot the live clip. And for "People Pt. 2" or "SDL," we might be having a female singer as the featured artist. SUGA: We're friends. There were many candidates, but when we worked together before, I would simply ask her things, and she would make the changes right away. That made the process a lot easier. -That's why I chose IU. -(DRUMS BEATING) -(INDISTINCT CHATTER) -(KEYBOARD PLAYING) ("People Pt. 2 (feat IU)" PLAYS) ♪ So time is yet ♪ ♪ Now, right here to go ♪ ♪ I know you know ♪ ♪ Anything does know ♪ ♪ So time is yet ♪ ♪ Now, right here to go ♪ ♪ Nobody doesn't know anymore ♪ ♪ This thing called love ♪ ♪ Maybe it's just a momentary list of emotions ♪ ♪ It's conditional What is it I love? ♪ ♪ Wasn't loved enough as a kid ♪ ♪ That's why I'm the cautious type ♪ ♪ I want it something deep with people ♪ ♪ Forever's something like a sand castle you know ♪ ♪ It comes crumbling down at the smallest of waves ♪ ♪ What is it about loss that makes us so sad? ♪ ♪ Really, it's dread that makes us so sad ♪ ♪ So far away, you're gone ♪ ♪ Getting far away ♪ ♪ Too far away, you're gone ♪ ♪ I know I have to know ♪ ♪ So time is yet ♪ ♪ Now, right here to go ♪ ♪ I know you know ♪ ♪ Anything does know ♪ ♪ So time is yet ♪ ♪ Now, right here to go ♪ ♪ Nobody doesn't know anymore ♪ SUGA: ♪ What is it that makes you so sad? ♪ ♪ Really, it's the dread that's so daunting ♪ ♪ That time we thought we had a future together is gone ♪ ♪ We're the ones who tore down the sand castle ♪ ♪ They say there are no winners or losers but I'm always the loser ♪ ♪ We said we'd give our all but we broke it all down ♪ ♪ And then we leave ♪ ♪ Because both love and people are selfish ♪ BOTH: ♪ So far away, you're gone ♪ ♪ Getting far away ♪ ♪ Too far away, you're gone ♪ ♪ I know I have to know ♪ ♪ So time is yet ♪ ♪ Now, right here to go ♪ ♪ I know you know ♪ ♪ Anything does know ♪ ♪ Know ♪ ♪ So time is yet ♪ ♪ Now, right here to go ♪ ♪ Here to go ♪ ♪ Nobody doesn't know ♪ -♪ Anymore ♪ -♪ Anymore ♪ ♪ So goes the person, so goes the love ♪ ♪ What comes at the end of love? ♪ ♪ Endless people a love that has passed by ♪ ♪ Is love wholly perfect on its own? ♪ ♪ Selflessness can actually be selfish too, you know ♪ ♪ I'm practically being greedy when I say it's all for you ♪ ♪ Will I be happy if I give up my greed? ♪ ♪ A half-illusion that can never be fulfilled ♪ ♪ They say life's a struggle between resistance and submission ♪ ♪ I say it's a struggle against loneliness ♪ ♪ If you can't hold it back it's okay to cry ♪ ♪ You're already enough to be loved ♪ BOTH: ♪ So time is yet ♪ ♪ Now, right here to go ♪ ♪ I know you know ♪ ♪ Anything does know ♪ ♪ So time is yet ♪ ♪ Now, right here to go ♪ ♪ Nobody doesn't know anymore ♪ (MUSIC ENDS) Whoo! (PLAYS "MERRY CHRISTMAS, MR. LAWRENCE") I've been staying here because I have plans in Tokyo today. And weirdly enough... (LAUGHING) ...there was this piano in the hotel. Since I'm already in Japan... I wanted to meet him last time, but I couldn't because I was too busy. I've been reaching out to him for a month or two, and he told me he'd like to meet me too. So, I'm very excited right now. (LAUGHS) So nervous. SUGA: (IN JAPANESE) Excuse me. (CALMING PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) THIS MEETING TOOK PLACE IN A PRIVATE ROOM DUE TO RYUICHI SAKAMOTO'S HEALTH -SUGA: Excuse me. Hello. -TRANSLATOR 1: Hello. -RYUICHI: SUGA? Oh... -SUGA: Yes, I'm SUGA. -RYUICHI: (IN KOREAN) Hello. -(SUGA CHUCKLES) RYUICHI: It's nice to meet you. -SUGA: Thank you. -RYUICHI: Wow. (TRANSLATOR 1 INTERPRETS) -RYUICHI: Yes, thank you. -(SUGA CHUCKLES) RYUICHI: (IN ENGLISH) Please. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) I've prepared a gift for you, but it's quite heavy... (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) It's an analog... LP? -TRANSLATOR 2: It's an LP record. -Thank you so much. (TRANSLATOR 1 INTERPRETS) TRANSLATOR 2: He's also brought some sheet music. -(IN JAPANESE) Gifts. They're heavy. -SUGA: Thank you. (IN KOREAN) I think it was a small theater in Daegu. They were playing The Last Emperor as their only movie. It was an unusual case, you know? There were maybe 50 seats? So... I went there when I was little. And the movie is filled with Mr. Sakamoto's music, so I was just blown away by it in the theater. (GASPS) I started making beats as a child. I used to sample songs and play around with them a lot. You know, to practice. That's when I sampled several of Mr. Sakamoto's songs, because they are mostly instrumentals without vocals. Anyone who's seen me working would know that I sample open-source audio files for a lot of my work. I cut and paste them, stick them together, reverse them, and change them, so they become more interesting. Going back to the days when I first started to train myself to make music, his music inspired me so much and it motivated me as well. I was so nervous on my way here. And the hotel got a piano for me, which was weird. (TRANSLATOR 1 LAUGHS) It was unexpected, but I still used it to practice a bit. He's been a musician for a long time and... I read in one of his interviews that even now, he's willing to make more music. What's driving you? I've been making music for 17 years now, and I sometimes get so tired to the point that I occasionally think about not making music anymore. So I wanted to ask him how he has done it for such a long time. (IN JAPANESE) I get it. Well, the thing is... No matter how many songs you make, you are never fully satisfied. -If you feel satisfied, that's the end. -(TRANSLATOR 2 ACKNOWLEDGES) RYUICHI: When you reach the top floor, you always find a floor above. There is no end. You try to climb up the stairs step by step, but the stairs go up infinitely. Still, I wish to do what I can to get as close to the top as possible. (IN KOREAN) I was like, "Mr. Sakamoto's music will cheer me up." And I was listening to all of his albums. Then it hit me. "I'd really like to write a song "that sounds like one of his early songs." So I wrote a song in the hospital. ("Snooze" PLAYS) (MUSIC ENDS) (RYUICHI SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) He enjoyed it very much. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) What are the lyrics about? Oh, the title of the song is "Snooze," which means "a light sleep." I wrote down the things that I'd like to say to aspiring artists. And... I wanted this song to give them some strength. "I know it's hard, but it's all gonna be okay." And ever since I was young, I've enjoyed writing songs about dreams. That's what I did here. "It's all gonna be okay." "Even though you might lose a bit of sleep." "I'll accept you." "I'll accept you if you're afraid to fall." Well... To be honest, it's not easy being a musician. It's not easy at all. There are so many kids out there who are losing sleep, skipping meals, and devoting themselves to music. And sometimes, some of those kids, who finally become musicians, they say to us, "I dreamed of being a musician because of you guys." Some say, "Your music inspired me to become a musician." So, this song is dedicated to those people. (RYUICHI SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) That is admirable. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) At the same time, the song might be giving you a message, that it's going to be okay. Oh, you should hear the instrumental version. I don't have it right now, but if you hear it... I was like, "I'm gonna make this song a true Sakamoto-style piece. "The strings will be his style, the piano will be his style." I was getting an IV drip in the hospital. I couldn't eat well. But I felt better when I started writing this song, so I finished it, took the IV out and left. -(TRANSLATOR 1 INTERPRETS) -(RYUICHI GRUNTS) -(SPEAKING JAPANESE) -TRANSLATOR 2: (LAUGHING) (IN KOREAN) He says he's sorry. I saw him making music in his documentary, and it was so cool. Sitting in front of a piano, going like this... -I thought about bringing my laptop... -(TRANSLATOR 1 LAUGHING) SUGA: ...but I just left it in my hotel room. One of my dreams is to travel around the world and schedule sessions with local musicians who specialize in their traditional instruments. It's my dream to record them and make my own music based on that. The most memorable line from Mr. Sakamoto's documentary was, "The world is full of sounds." To be honest, I've never gotten a formal education when it comes to music. I've always been the type to teach myself, so that line really spoke to me. "You can make music with any sound." I always say that to musicians that are less experienced than me. So, I'd like to do my best to use the sounds that are filling up this world and make good music. (LAUGHS) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) You're outstanding. (IN JAPANESE) Since my teenage years, I've been into different ethnic music. So when I entered university, I thought about becoming a scholar, not a composer, -to study ethnic music. -(TRANSLATOR 2 LAUGHING) As a scholar, I would've been able to spend my life in Africa and other places. How fun would that be? That's how much I was into it. I've always had a thing for new experiences. (TRANSLATOR 2 INTERPRETS) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) He loved being first. He was first at everything. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) He liked doing things before others did. RYUICHI: (IN JAPANESE) If you would... (CLEARS THROAT) Here's an example. Um... (CLEARS THROAT) This... (PLAYS PIANO) -(SPEAKING JAPANESE) -TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) Hear that? (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (PLAYS PIANO) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. -SUGA: (IN KOREAN) Yes. -TRANSLATOR 2: There are seven octaves. -RYUICHI: (IN ENGLISH) Seven notes. -TRANSLATOR 2: Yes. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) Play them together. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) It doesn't sound great. (PLAYS PIANO) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) Leave out the middle one. Use the remaining ones. -(PLAYS PIANO) -SUGA: Hm... (SPEAKING JAPANESE) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) It sounds better. -(INDISTINCT CHATTER) -(SPEAKING JAPANESE) (PLAYS PIANO) TRANSLATOR 2: (IN KOREAN) This is dissonance. Leave out the middle one, and it sounds better. RYUICHI: (IN JAPANESE) Beautiful sound. Interesting. (LAUGHTER) (IN KOREAN) I'd like to play you a song. -(TRANSLATOR 1 INTERPRETS) -RYUICHI: Oh! (LAUGHTER) -(IN ENGLISH) Please, please. -(SUGA INHALES) (IN KOREAN) I'm shaking. (PLAYS "MERRY CHRISTMAS, MR.

I really wish the best for his health. I want to keep listening to him play. Now I feel clueless about what to do. (CHUCKLES) I'm feeling the pressure again. (LAUGHS) I'll still be making music even when I get old. I'd love to make music in my fifties and sixties. So I'm excited to see what kind of musician I'll become. If I could still be making music at his age... I'm always thinking about what kind of musician I should be... so it was great meeting him. It's always a pleasure to meet and talk with musicians. Even those who are much older than... He's actually older than my dad. And I'm just impressed that we could have such a conversation. (EXHALES) It was amazing. This is what I came to Japan for.

I love my job. I love K-pop. (PLAYS SYNTHESIZER) ("Haegeum" PLAYS) I struggled so much while I was working on "Haegeum." So, I made the beat and then the hook. I even wrote the lyrics up to "Could be somebody's cause of death." That was three years ago. When we were shooting BTS IN THE SOOP.

When you make a piece of work, it's not often that you can say, "It's better than the old version." You always compare them. "It's not quite there. I don't like this." And amidst such a struggle, "Haegeum" was born. "Haegeum" can mean an instrument but also freeing what's forbidden... There were "locked" tracks in rhythm games I played as a kid. When you get past a certain stage, you can unlock those songs. The thing about idols... is that we don't have to commit a crime or do something that's controversial for people to blow little things out of proportion and judge us. I could never understand the mentality of those people. I mean, I've never caused trouble, but... So... (INHALES) You know, well... Like when an idol smokes a cigarette in a music video, these kinds of things... Say I get criticized for these things at the age of 31. I strongly believe it's a social phenomenon that we need to think about. I wanted to unlock what is forbidden to us. And since a world of information is just a click away from us now, even I stopped bringing my imagination and my thoughts into action. So this is my message: "Let's free ourselves from these things." Thanks to all the brilliant technology we have, we can now easily find out what's happening around the world. But I strongly feel that this is the reason why some things in our lives are actually forbidden to us. It's okay to care less about what others think. You should be able to do what you want.
