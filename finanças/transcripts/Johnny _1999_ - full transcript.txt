You can't be cool when you're old. Fuck Alice. All I know is that guy's gonna have a fucking sore arm tonight. [everyone laughs] I hope he didn't call the cops. This has nothing to do with the cops, man. What Johnny did was right. - Cops aren't in this, man. - Well done. I don't think that Albert liked it too much. Did you, Albert? Albert doesn't really like confrontation. Do you, Albert? What is it that you like, Albert? What is it, is it the... Is it the service? [laughs] Definitely. We need the money. We need money. Well, there's plenty of ways to find money, Albert. What you need is a little nerve. [people talking and laughing] [man] Fucking loser. - Hey... - [laughs] Where's Dell? You're new here, Dell come in. Come here. - Hey! - I see you over there. Peekaboo! [Johnny] Come here. [people talking and laughing] You're new here so you probably don't know Albert. But he's got a story, you want to tell it Albert? No? All right then I'll tell it, I'll tell Albert's story. This is... this is Albert's story. For you, Dell. Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Albert. Albert loved his mommy very much, more than anything in the world, really. And everyday when she went to work, Albert would cry. But she would always reassure him in a gentle voice that she would be back in a few hours. But one day she came back a little later than she said she would. And the next day later. And the next day later, until Albert began to worry that she would never come back. So he followed her. And he followed her a long way into the city, and she stopped at a bar. [music in the background] Albert was too young to go in, so he just waited outside until she came out. He waited a long time. It started to get dark and there were bright lights on the front of that building and they lit up the street. Albert can see pictures of naked women all over the front of that place. Something Albert had never really seen. And when she came out, she had a guy with her. He had long, greasy, black hair and these eyes like a fish. Like dead eyes. He crossed the street to catch up to them and suddenly quite by surprise, she turned around and she saw him standing there. She scolded him for following her and Albert felt ashamed. But he kept staring at that guy. Those dead eyes. He had to know. "Are you my... daddy?" [mean laugh] - Albert said. - [men laugh] So he said. [men laugh] [funny voice] Papa, hey! [mean laugh] [funny voice] Hello little boy. [funny voice] Are you my daddy? That was really great, Johnny. Who's gonna be your mommy now, Albert? [Johnny] What about Alice? Alice could be your mommy. You want to be a mommy, don't you Alice? [mean laugh] You're a prick. [Johnny] Doesn't anyone want to be Albert's mommy? He needs someone. What about you? [Johnny] You must have come for a reason. Maybe you could be my mommy. [Johnny] What do you think? I don't know. [footsteps] [pat on the back] I'm sorry, Albert. [guitar playing] [fighting and screams] [fighting and screams] [punches and screams] [guitar playing] [fighting and screams] [traffic noise] What are you doing baby? [sighs] [sighs] [laughs] [kissing] [grunts] [grunts] Come on, sweetie. Come on baby, get up. You're making a movie for your Ma? I don't know, Ma. Johnny, Johnny... - [laughs] - Look at Ma. I'm looking, Ma. Look at it. [laughs] Hey sweetie, what are you thinking honey? Huh? [car approaching] - [men screaming] - [car honking] [men screaming] Fuck off! - [car hits Johnny] - [Johnny] Oh!

Come on. [door opens] [footsteps] [laughing] You scared me. I'm sorry. - Stop. - [Johnny] What? - [laughs] - You don't like to be filmed? - I don't know. - You look good on camera. You think so? No, I know so. You have a perfect face. Are you recording? Yeah, do you mind? Why? I want to get to know you. You just say that to all the girls. Is that was Alice told you? Maybe. [sighs] But I don't always listen to what Alice tells me. [Dell] I don't think she thinks you're good for me. And what do you think? [Dell] I hardly know you. Do you want to get to know me? Yeah. [Johnny] Are you going back home? Oh, I don't know. - Alice comes and goes. - I'm not Alice. I can see that. [Johnny] Anyway, with me you can be yourself. There are no rules. Yeah? [Johnny] What's your mother like? I don't want you to know that stuff about me. [Johnny] Why? I want you to look at me and only see what's in front of your eyes. You think that is possible? Just try. [Dell] What do you see? What I want to see. What's that? [kissing] [kissing] [siren wailing] Hey, this is it. Look at this fucking guy. - [voices on video] - [mimicking voices] [laughs] Look at this one. [voices on video] [voice on video] Give me the goddamn camera. [white noise] - Marcus, you fucking idiot. - What? What do you mean what? You dropped the fucking camera. Well, I was gonna get hit. That's the scene, the only thing that makes the scene and he drops the fucking camera. What the fuck was I supposed to do? You're so fucking stupid, Marcus. You're a fucking idiot, you know that? Come on Johnny, give him a break. Shut the fuck up, Albert. Why should I give him a break? I went to breaking my neck, what the fuck are you doing man? - Johnny! - Shut the fuck up, Albert. What, are you his bitch or something? Shut up. - [Albert] All right. - Thank you. You weren't gonna get hit, Marcus. The other guy was gonna get hit. All you had to do is get the shot. All right, give me a break. I'm new with the camera and shit, I don't... [Johnny] Look, this is reality, okay? It's not some fucking TV show. We're only gonna get shots like that once. [hitting in the legs] [screams in pain] Oh, Jesus Christ. It's the last scene you shoot. You all right? What the fuck are you doing Dell? Come on help him, he's obviously hurt, help him. Give me the fucking camera. [Johnny] Jesus Christ. [screams in pain in recording] Jesus Christ. Yeah, yeah fine. All right, you're fine. [Marcus] Dick. [white noise] [traffic noise] [footsteps approaching] - You don't smoke. - Give me that. What are you still doing here? I could ask you the same thing. Yeah, well I came to talk to you. About what? I don't know. I can't stay here anymore. Just go home then. I can't go home, it's too fucked up, you know that. Yeah, I don't know what I've been waiting for. [Dell] I should have left a long time ago. You are really not coming back? I don't know Alice, I'm still checking things out. [men laughing in the distance] [Johnny] Dell! Dell where are you? Get some ice for Marcus. All right, gotta go. [door opens] Johnny needs me. [Dell] I'll see you around, okay?

Just getting some stuff, Alice. You know I didn't take you to thinking you were gonna stay. You never took me there. I'm not saying I think you should stay here either. - Then why did you come back? - Fuck off. You know, Johnny's pretty fucked up. Do you really know him, Alice? Look, Dell there is a lot you don't know. He loves people to think he lives on the streets. You know, this tough street punk. Well, I've seen where he lives. I've seen where he lives. - So? - He's full of shit. - Well, you're just jealous. - What are you talking about? You're jealous because Johnny wouldn't touch you if you were the last woman on the fucking planet. - What? Is Johnny telling you this? - Does it fucking matter, Alice? It's so obvious, even Marcus can fucking see it. [Alice] Dell, I'm trying to protect you. - Well fuck off! - Don't you tell me to fuck off. You're gonna turn out like Mom, I can see it already.

Nobody's gonna talk to her, Johnny. It's freezing. I know the street. There's plenty of these fuckers around, you just gotta wait. It'll happen, just keep rolling. [exhales sharply] So, has she ever done this before? What? What do you mean "what?" Prostitution. How would you feel about her if she did? I don't know. I mean, does it excite you Sean? [traffic noise] [laughs nervously] No. No? A beautiful young girl like that of her own free will. She makes money. Guys she serves, she makes them happy. They're all so grateful there can't be any harm in it. It's just good commerce. [laughs ironically] Commerce. Fuck you, I don't see you out there. Wouldn't bother me.

She's beautiful, isn't she? Yeah, she's... She's beautiful. [breathing heavily] [kissing] I don't think he's into it, Dell. Get off. [Dell] Why? [Johnny] Look at him, he's obviously not interested. [Sean] Get back. [sighs] - [Johnny] Look. What's the matter, Sean? Don't you like Dell? She's pretty, isn't she? [whispering] Yeah. You don't want to, do you? [Johnny] Do you? [Johnny] I know what you want, don't I? Go wait outside, don't come back until I tell you. Get out, Sean. Get out, Sean. [Johnny] Good boy. [door opens] [door closes] Come here, Dell. [traffic noise] [radio skipping sound] [siren wailing] [woman] Not again, ew! [sighs] [muffled scream] [woman] What are you doing? [breathing heavily] [slamming door] [door opens] [indistinct chattering] Oh yeah, give me some love! [indistinct chattering] Right on. [car honking] [indistinct chattering] Hey, Dell. I just... came to apologize for the other night at the house. I wanted to see how you were. Well, take a good look and fuck off. See, Dell... I need to talk to you. I want to get out of here, you know. With you. - And go home? - No. No, not home. Away. Well, this is my home now. What is? Here, with Johnny. Look, Alice, I... I don't need you anymore. Just go without me. I can't. That's your problem. - I want to take you out of here. - I like it here. Well, for one thing, I'm not a frigid little bitch like you. [laughing] God. Alice, he told me everything. How you used to always complain when he touched you, always pushing him away. What do you think got me pregnant? You're lying. - Yeah, if you want to think so. - You're lying! What the fuck do you think, Dell? [yelling at each other] [Dell] Walk away from me, fucking bitch! You bastard, don't fuck her up. [traffic noise] [footsteps leaving] It's not true, is it? What? You never slept with her, did you? Dell... she's full of shit. She's just jealous. And she's going to try to say anything to take you away from me. That's not going to happen. Is it? [traffic noise] [Johnny] Okay? [kicking a can] [airplane passing by] [kissing] [traffic noise] [door knocking] - Hello? - Hi, is Johnny here? You're one of his friends? Uh, yeah, I'm Albert. Albert, huh? Johnny's friends don't come over. Did I come by too early? No. I'm making coffee. Come in the kitchen, wait with me. I'll drag his ass off sooner or later. - Thanks, Mrs... - Call me Ma. [laughing] Okay, Ma. What's so funny? You just don't seem like the mother type, that's all. [laughing] I'll take that as a compliment. [Albert] Okay. Don't go to any trouble for me. It's okay. It's no trouble. I like well-mannered boys. Sign of a good upbringing. I always have a little shot in the morning. Take the edge off the day. [both laughing] [dog barking] [both laughing] [bottle hits the table] [sits on chair] So... [sighs] Albert. Tell me about yourself. Oh, well, Johnny and I've been hanging for about six years now. I guess we're best buddies. Six years? I've never seen you before. Stuff is busy. [laughing] [Ma] Where do you live? In an apartment? Uh... [laughing] [sucking fingers] Sort of... More just a squat, really, you know. It's temporary. [Ma] A squat? You know, I live there with about seven or eight people. Guys? Girls? Couple of girls, mostly guys. I sort of look after everybody in a way, I guess. You look after everybody? How does Johnny fit in here? What does Johnny do? He looks after me, I guess. Johnny looks after you? [laughs] [sighs] [laughs nervously] [whispering] Open wide. [chair moves abruptly] [Ma] Jesus, you little son of a bitch! I've told you not to stink up on me a million times. It's time to go, Albert. Sit down, Albert. You haven't finished your coffee. It's time to go. Thank you. [dog barking] [sighs] [calm trip-hop music] Hey, can I help you with something you guys? Hey guys, can I help you with anything? [burps] Yeah, okay. You know what? You guys are just here to what, steal shit? You know what? Why don't you get out, okay? You guys want to take off please? [men laughing] Okay guys, this is how it works, all right? This is my phone and if you don't leave I call the cops, you understand? [mocking fearful sound] Yeah, okay, so you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna count to three, I'm gonna call the cops and then you guys, you can leave or you can stay and the cops can throw you out, I don't care which. Okay, here we go. One, two... Yeah, okay. Yeah, have a nice day, guys. [hangs up phone] This is my phone, I use it to call the cops. I like to blow them, I've got a pussy for a mouth. Fucking son of a bitch. Man, I can fucking kick his ass. This is interesting. Hey, listen to this. Here's an interesting creature. This animal has bright, fierce colors to make a tough impression, but nine times out of ten if challenged they'll back down and run away. It's kind of like you, Albert. What's that supposed to fucking mean? Well, I mean, you're a tough guy, right? [funny voice] Look at me, tough guy. [funny voice] You're tough guy! [funny voice] Me, angry tough guy! [others laughing] [speaking normally] What the fuck you laughing at, man? Albert, I'm laughing at you. You're a fucking coward. Come on, coward little coward. [speaking like a child] I'm so scared, I'm a big coward. Fuck you, Johnny, fuck you! [Johnny] You're not a coward? I'll tel you what, why don't you go inside and grab me five of these, tough guy? [Albert] Fuck you. Fuck you? Fuck you, man. If you're so tough, go get me the magazines. What, you want me to get you five magazines, that makes me a fucking tough guy? You're gonna talk or get the magazines? You're a big, tough guy. Fuck! All right, I'll do it. [funny voice] Let him go, he's a tough guy. Here, is that what you want? - No, no, no. Not this time. - Fuck you, man! You're going back inside. I'm fucking calling with the cops, okay? Let's go. Say bye to your buddies. I don't know that guy. Come on. [Johnny] I don't know that guy. [siren wailing] [Sean laughs] [Johnny] Hey let's go. [laughing] [laughing] No, no, no. [traffic noise] [indistinct chatter] [door closes] [laughing] [people talking in the video] Is that fucking real? [people talking in the video] [Johnny] Of course it's real, look at it. [people talking in the video] [Dell] Look, I got to get moving. Those are hookers? She's not a hooker, it's just a fucking scene. Oh... Johnny, Dell's got a new defender over here. Do you think that Dell would sleep with a stranger for money? I don't know. Well, shut up then, all right? - Who the hell is this? - Shh! [Sean speaking in the video] Can I kiss you, Johnny? [everyone laughs] And then it's whack, right? You slap and shit. - Come on, come on. - [Johnny] Shh! [Sean speaking in the video] Can I kiss you, Johnny?

Look, would you do this up for me, please? Yeah. [laughing in the distance] You remember when we first met? [Sean] Yeah. You only wanted to talk to me. Do you want to talk to me now? I don't know. So you like girls, Sean? Yeah, yeah, of course. Do you like me? [laughs nervously] - You're Johnny's girl, so... - Just forget that. That's kind of hard. What do you want? I don't know. Do you want me? I don't know. [traffic noise] Sean, Sean. What? I want you to be in a scene today. [lighter clicks] Right, what do you want me to do? [sighs] You want me to be in a scene? I was gonna... I don't know. Maybe I should just film. Not today. Well, who's gonna do that then? Who's gonna run the camera? I will. Johnny, I'm a pretty bad actor. I don't think this is a very good idea. [Johnny] Oh no, no. There's no acting. [Sean] So then what's the scene? It's the scene between you and Dell. I want to recreate that moment where you first two met. Okay, well, I'm just letting you know I get pretty nervous in front of a camera. You'll be fine. We'll improvise. [siren wailing] [indistinct chattering] [Sean] Hey, I'm... I'm sorry to bother you. I don't even know if that's exactly what I said. It's okay. Just improvise. Don't look at the camera. I'm not here, okay? I just suck at doing this. It's okay, just go. Look, I'm new in town, so... Do you know how to get to this place right here? God, you're fucking terrible. Dell, shut the fuck up.

[footsteps] I was pretty frail kid, you know? I used to get beaten on a regular basis. [sighs] I remember this one time, I'd been watching some cartoons. I must have been like six. And... I spilled some pop on the rug... and my mom flipped. She beat me real bad and she threw me out on the snow. And I stood there, with this look on my face like... I saw that look in you. That's what this shit about. Your mother beat you as a kid? I... I don't care, Johnny. I don't want to hear it. So what are you gonna do? I don't... I don't know, I'm... I'm leaving, I'm leaving. I don't want you to leave. What are you talking about? That's fucking bullshit back there. [Johnny] I know, I know. I know and I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to go that far. It was out of my control. I got to be honest, Sean. I have really strong feelings for you. I can't deny it. You've got something I never had. I mean, I look in the mirror... I look in the mirror and I'm ashamed. But I look at you and you're beautiful. You can't leave, Sean. I need you once more. [Sean] Okay, what's the scene?

Who is this "we" you keep talking about? [Marcus] All of us! I'm talking about all of us. All of us? You have to ask all of us. Guys, are you all so fucking weak-minded that you'll do whatever anyone tells you to do? Or do we make decisions together? Together, Johnny. Same as always. Together, same as always. So it's decided then, we do the final scene. And you, Gus, you can take all your shit and you can go We don't need you. Look, I'm sorry. Fuck you, man. Fuck you. Fuck me.
