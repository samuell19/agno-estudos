You are aware. You are now in very serious trouble. Okay. Because your face was caught on CCTV camera. Okay. Okay. Do you know this person? A month ago, we just moved to Jakarta. Following my husband's work. That night, we were celebrating Maikel's birthday. With left hand on waist, and eyes all the way. The frog admires his reflection in the pond. - My skin is green and blotchy. - That's gross. My eyes are round, hmm more round. Babe, I'm sorry... When the frog tilts its body to the right, suddenly, suddenly... byurr... Ha ha... Byuurr... He's drowning, drowning. So, did you drown too? Hah? That's it, that's it today... Well, the book fell again. - Come on here and there, sleepy huh... - He'eh Happy birthday... Good night, have a nice dream. Alright, yeah, yeah... You just calm down... Baby... Baby... Hey, babe... Umm... Sorry, the door is not open... Beb, you know my assistant, don't you, Sandra? Babe. I'm so sorry. I really need to get back to the office. Give me 1 more week like this.

Umm, where is Mrs. Sandra's house? Mrs. Sandra... Do you know manners? - At night break down people's doors. - Dear dear... - Calm dear. - You think I took your husband? I'm very wrong. Heh... Heh... I work from morning to night. You don't have to beg to be a woman, it's not right. I know I'm a difficult person. Not that I'm looking for money like this. I make money the halal way. I made a big mistake. My husband is not cheating. Turns out my husband is a very nice person. They still don't want to talk to me. And now... There are people who always send videos... ...who is stalking our house from outside. Repeatedly. Hello... Maikel. Vita, have you seen Maikel? I was home earlier. Who with? He said the same uncle. He rides a motorbike. Riding a motorcycle? Maikel, where have you been? Mama never told you, You can't go out with people you never know Mommy is worried about you. Maikel... Maikel, I'm sorry mom. Mami... Mommy... Mommy no... no... Mommy, Mommy I love you... Maikel... ma'am... Here's another package. Have you received the package? I sent the same package to your husband. I want to apologize about yesterday. I... ...i shouldn't... ...do the same with you. Okay. It's okay. Umm... Got a post for my husband? Um... ...I have kept it in his room. Okay. Thank you. Baby... No, I... ...just after the meeting with the client, then... ...near here too, so I... ...come here to take you to lunch maybe if you're not busy. Ouch... Okay... Wait a minute, it's only 11 o'clock. So, let me finish this first, okay? Take your time. Baby... ...maybe... ...I forgot that I had an appointment with a doctor. Okay. I accept if you want to break up. But I ask... ...you came to my place for the last time. Vins, I don't want you to interfere with my life anymore. I want our relationship to end. I don't want to lose everything because of you. - No kisses? - No! - Free! - Come on. - What do you want? - Not here... What matters is the last time. Please let go. Come with me. Take it off... noo... noo... No Vins... But your husband said otherwise. Husband? My husband... my husband who... I don't know anything. He has nothing to do with it. He... Help... Please sir, don't involve my husband. In this matter. Because your husband's face too... ...caught by CCTV camera. And your husband is in the next room. Your husband has told me everything. In fact... ...I've known about their affair for a long time. So... ...how long have you known that they are cheating? A month ago. My work requires my full concentration. At that time... The building I'm building. Unstopping off. Sir, I have a guest who wants to meet you. Oh, Sandra, I don't want to meet people anymore. And from there... ...I'm starting to get suspicious. Hello... Stop, babe. So you already know that they are cheating? And only now to act? I... ...I just want to convince myself. If all this is true, my fault. Until my wife ...seeking attention from other men. Or... ...she really likes that guy, or... ...or he just wants to play around. Baby... I guess I forgot that I had an appointment with a doctor. I accept if you want to break up. But I ask... ...you came to my place for the last time. No Vincent. I will never come to your place again. You don't bother my wife. You don't disturb my family. If you bother my family again... ...you take the risk. Understand? Don't you understand? If you say so, don't be careless. You took him from me, you know that? Hah! I've been with him for more than 10 years, you know? Dog! Mischa... You don't have to give him any more information. Investigator brother. I am Mischa's attorney. Is my client really detained? As long as there is no evidence and witnesses, brother investigator can not detain my client. Not. I'm just asking for information. - Thank you. - Ready! Brother Mischa, come on. Come on, thank you. Mischa, - Yes... - I have picked up your child. And I have left it at Jody's house. Thanks. Why were they released sir? Because we don't have enough evidence to detain them. Why sir? No, I'm just surprised ...why in one case... ...there are two culprits. Babe. Forgive me. I know I was wrong. I made a mistake. I want to go back to my family, babe. Do you want to forgive me, baby? Forgive me... Oh, please... I'm sorry babe. I'm sorry for you, I'm sorry. Oh my god. Mischa... Mischa... Mischa... Oh sissy. Mischa... Mischa... Hehe... Mischa... Mischa... Mischa... Mischa... Mischa... Mischa... Mischa... seriously, don't play games. Where are you? Mischa... Mischa... Thank you sir. With this incident, both of you are freed from all charges I only have one question. Who was actually in the apartment at that time?
