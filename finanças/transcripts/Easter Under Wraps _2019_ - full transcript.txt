Hello. Hi. Would you like to sample one of our Easter chocolates? These are handmade. Those are so cute. Jessie, this isn't just any customer. Sorry, Miss Cavendish. It's fine. This is Erin Cavendish, director of marketing. She visits the store quite often. Nice to meet you. I'm so sorry, Miss Cavendish. I didn't know. It's okay. I keep a pretty low profile. I'm not exactly the face of the company. - Good morning. - Morning, Parker. Coffee? - Notes. - Thank you. Carter's about to start in the boardroom. With Easter almost six weeks away, our first shipments are arriving in stores across the country, including the output from our newly implemented automated line at the Sweetwater factory. And here is a sneak preview. Pass 'em around, don't be shy. More machines means faster turnover. If all goes well, our Iowa factory will follow suit. Thank you, Carter. We certainly appreciate your optimism. But as we know, last year, for the first time in Cavendish history, Easter sales were down. This happen again. As most of you may have heard by now, our VP, Bryce Cameron, was poached away by that trendy new company, Chocmate. Couple that with our recent lag in sales, and... If I may speak about Chocmate for a moment, Foster. Mr. Cavendish. Chocmate may be the new kid on the block, but they were No. 1 in sales last quarter for the West Coast market. I'm well aware. Their modern flavours seem to be catching on. I never thought green tea and chocolate would go together. And they're more automated than we are. Their product is getting into the market with more speed and efficiency. So, until we decide to get rid of all our handmade chocolates... But, part of our product's appeal, from a marketing point of view, is the personal touch, right? Artisan handcrafted chocolate is a major part of our identity, our brand. Good point, Erin. But if you look at sales, and Erin knows this, our brand clearly needs a boost, and from an operations standpoint, I know we can do better. I have to be honest, Cavendish Chocolates has lost a step. I was planning to announce my retirement later this year but I just can't do that now. I don't have anyone I can trust to take over, and I've gotta get to the bottom of our problems. May... maybe Carter was right, we've lost a step. But, we'll get back on track, Dad. Well, I wanna see firsthand how phase one of this first automation is impacting operations at the Sweetwater factory. Maybe roll up my own sleeves, talk to the men and women on the frontlines. They'll probably just tell you what you want to hear. It's true, it could be difficult to tell the boss the hard truth. You could always go undercover, disguise yourself as one of the factory workers. Sorry, bad joke. Brilliant. What? But it can't be me. It has to be someone less recognizable. Me? Who better? You've been good at keeping out of the spotlight. Well, I, I haven't even been at the company a year. Perfect. No one will recognize you. I have my MBA. And? And I wouldn't know the first thing about working in a factory. Well, this isn't just any factory, this is our flagship. This is the factory your grandfather built, the heart and soul of this business. I haven't been there since what, I was 10 years old? What, so you'll have fresh eyes. And the three-hour drive from Seattle to Sweetwater is really lovely. You know that I'm starting my new marketing job in Chicago this May. I only took this position as a favour to help you. Look, I know this is not your passion, but if you could just do this one thing for me. I mean think of it as an opportunity for personal and professional growth. Find out who you really are. But I already... You'll go down there as an employee transferred from the Iowa factory. I'll sort out the details with HR. Nobody else needs to know. Only who we need to pull it off. All right, fine. Excellent. Better pack your bags, you'll probably be there a few weeks. A few weeks? Yeah, well, we need a full report. Well what about my department here? Well, you've surrounded yourself with a very talented marketing team, we'll be just fine. Erin, your grandfather came to Sweetwater, Washington, over 90 years ago, with nothing more than a suitcase and a dream. And how's that dream today? Well, the most famous chocolate producer on the West Coast, a string of chocolate shops across the country, even a chocolate museum in his name. This is very important. This is family. Chocolate bunny? This is a chocolate buttercream treasure chest. I made it personally. The box itself is completely edible, made from our finest handcrafted chocolate. And the best part is... It opens up, revealing a small treasure of candy inside. Bryan. We're trying to phase out handmade products. Yes, I know that, but... I'm very happy with the chocolate lineup I have for next year. But I always appreciate your visits coming down here from the factory. Keeps me thinking. Thanks. Okay. You can leave the box. Just so I have it on file. All right. Hi. I'm Veronica Erinson. It's a pleasure to meet you. I can't believe I'm doing this. You can't tell anyone in the office. This has to be our secret. But everybody knows that I'm the worst at keeping secrets. Here. Take my car keys. I can drive your Lexus? Yes. Park it in my spot. It'll be like I'm still here. And I'll take your car to Sweetwater. If anyone comes looking for me, take a message. It'll be like I never left. This is so exciting. If you have any questions for me about the Easter campaign, call me. I left a ton of notes for you on my lap... We'll be fine. Veronica. Veronica. I just got to the B&B, Dad. I'll call you later, bye. Welcome. Your house is charming. I'm Lyla, this is my husband, Grant. Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Erinson. Your house is so lovely. Thank you, we like to think of it as the finest B&B in town. Well, it'll only be temporary until I can find my own place. However long you stay, the upstairs is all yours. And the kitchen is here. You're welcome to use the stove and there's always a seat at the dinner table if you like. Thank you, that's very kind. So you're starting work at the chocolate factory? First thing tomorrow. Lyla and I used to work at the Cavendish factory ourselves. Really? Over 30 years. It's where we met. Now we're retired and run the Cavendish Chocolate Museum. That is so sweet. Pun intended? Have you been? Of course, it's the family... It's the family Cavendish. They're famous in these parts. I'm so tired. I had a really long drive, so I think I'm gonna go to bed and get ready for tomorrow, so thank you. Goodnight, Erin. I don't think he told her. We know who you are, dear. Your dad told us. We go way back. The three of us used to work on the assembly line together. Very inventive performance. Great start. Okay, well thank you. Good night. These new automated cocoa bean sorters can't do the same precise work as by hand. Give it time, Bryan. Chalk it up to growing pains. Growing pains. My department has lost four good people to these machines in the last month. Sorry. Yes? I'm Erin... son. Veronica Erinson. Yes, of course. Word just got to me. Come in. Sit down. I'm Susan Enwright, factory manager. I like to meet all our new employees personally, no matter what department. Transfer from Iowa. First time in Sweetwater? Veronica? Yes? I asked if you've ever been to Sweetwater before. Yes. When I was 10, just driving through. Now. Wobbly chair. I've asked for a new one, but red tape, right? Takes forever. I've given up. Now, you've probably heard from your time in Iowa, but our latest company slogan is "Living the Sweet Life". We have a new marketing team. I think they're doing a great job. Ã”hank you. For telling me that. So, welcome to Sweetwater, and I hope you will indeed live the sweet life with us. I'll give you a quick tour. Grab an egg. You've arrived during our most important season, Easter. Here at the factory, we're all one big family. And I consider every new employee to be like a piece of unformed chocolate, waiting to be moulded. You'll be working one of the assembly lines with Florence Baker, very experienced, she'll show you the ropes. You can call me Flo, that's what everyone does. Nice to meet you, Flo. We're gonna start you off with our famous butter chocolate moulding machine. It creates the base of one of Cavendish's most popular Easter treats, the... Buttery Bunny. Right. It actually overtook the Rainbow Rabbit the last two Easters as our most popular spring chocolate. Is that right? Sales were down overall, but the Buttery Bunny was a bright spot. I mean, that's what I heard. Where I used to work. In Iowa. All right then, let's just make sure the Buttery Bunny keeps on going strong. Okay, this is the chocolate flow over here, the moulds come down the conveyer belt like this, you step on the pedal to stop the flow of the chocolate. You fill the tray like this, and then you put it in the cooling unit like this, and there you go. All right, let's do this. All right, your turn. Now you show me. Okay then, that's... that's enough. Try to keep it straight... Okay, you gotta be fast. A little bit faster. Okay, all right, no, don't... don't... There we go. One tray at a time, one tray at a time. Okay. No, no, don't pick it up, don't pick it up. - All right... - Okay, I'm just going to... Oh, no, don't pour it... okay. Nope, nope. You... You know what, maybe we'll just start you off with, you know, something else. Something easier. Less messy. Why don't you pick up the pace just a little? It's moving so fast, it's stressful. You know what I like to say? Just go with the flow. Thanks, I'm trying. What are you wearing on your feet? Aren't they cute? Honey, those are not sensible work shoes. Oh my goodness, it has been such a long day and I am exhausted. Girl, you're funny. That's lunch. Where's your lunch? I didn't... What are you gonna eat? Chocolate or marshmallows? Actually, that's my favourite combo but it gets old quick. I usually eat out. I don't know how they do it in Iowa, but we bring our own. Here, nothing special, but it's gonna get you through the afternoon. Thank you, that's very nice of you. Don't be so modest, Flo. You make the best ham and swiss this side of Mt. Baker. Oh, stop. Ryan, this is Veronica. It's her first day. - Hi. - Hi. We sort of met this morning... Yeah. We bumped into each other. I, saw that you were upset. I mean, I... I couldn't help but overhear. Things have been... challenging. Over the past year. How so? Ryan's not a big fan of our new automated systems. I've been head chocolatier and QC supervisor for the past eight years, and I can tell you from experience that faster does not always mean better, and quantity definitely does not always mean quality. I'm sorry, it's just sometimes I feel like management has no clue what actually goes on around here. Here we go again. No, they sit up there in their corporate towers, and they make decisions about the very people who are making their products for them, without ever consulting them. And then you have Carter Darren, the director of operations. He comes down here what, two times a year? And he doesn't even listen to my ideas for new recipes. I just make what they tell me to. I'm sure Carter is very busy and management, they... they probably mean well, it's... I'm sorry, but who's side are you on? Hey, you two. All I'm saying is just... just once, could I have someone from corporate other than Carter Darren to come down here... a Cavendish, an actual, real Cavendish, come down here, sit next to me face to face and have a conversation. Is that too much to ask? And... it's your first day. And I'm putting all of this on you. I should just be quiet and eat my sandwich. Hi, dear. Hi, Lyla. Hi, Grant. Erin. These Easter decorations look great! So festive. They're for the Sweetwater Easter Festival. It's one of the most popular events of the year. There's a pageant, potato sack races, the big Easter egg hunt for the kids. Yeah. That sounds wonderful. It is. So, how was your first day? How does "challenging" sound? Sounds about right. Yeah. Do you know someone named Bryan who works in the factory? Bryan Bailey. Everyone knows Bryan. Nice fellow and struggling a bit. His wife passed away two years ago? Almost two and a half. He's finding his way back, though. He has a lovely daughter, Madison. That's good. I left you some bubble bath upstairs if you wanna have a soak. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Thank you. You're welcome, Erin. Or, are you still Veronica? Honestly at this point, I have no idea. Good night. How was your first day, Erin? First day was a real eye-opener, Dad. Well, Easter's the best time to be there. What did you learn? That I can't keep up with Buttery Bunnies, but that might be my fault, I haven't quite mastered it yet. You'll get the hang of it. Although, I did learn that one of the new machines might be compromising the cocoa beans. It could be affecting the quality of the chocolate. Well, that's why you're there. Keep listening. That's what I'm doing, learning from the ground floor, literally. That's where you started out, right Dad? What was your first day like in the factory when you were younger? A total disaster. So you're in fine company, darlin'. So... I was thinking that the Buttery Bunny line may not be your cup of tea. So maybe working on the Easter baskets would be a better fit. Bryan will train you, he's supervising our new basket assembly machines, so... I'm not sure if you know this, but I... I don't think that Bryan and I really get along. Well, like I said yesterday... Like I said yesterday, we are one big family here. We have to learn to work together, no matter our differences. Persistent. Do you mind if... It's okay, go ahead. Thanks. Hi, I can't talk right now. Carter has been asking for you since yesterday, and I'm running out of excuses. Well, tell him I went to a breakfast meeting, er, er, brunch. Brunch is better. But your car's still here. I took an Uber. Gotta go. Bye. Sorry about that. Where were we? You and Bryan. Working together. Right. Are you sure that's a good idea? I thought of it, so it must be good. Have an egg. Reporting for Easter basket duty. Yes. So I heard. So, you're not supervising the ingredients today? No, looks like my department doesn't need me as much lately. But in my capacity as quality control manager, I'm in charge of Easter basket oversight. Look, we got off on the wrong foot the other day, and I was really hoping that maybe we could get on the right one. I would like that. Okay then. Come here. This is our newest addition. It assembles our Easter baskets for us, meant to do the work of a dozen employees. I see. And this is Murray, manning the station. Not one of our newest additions. Pleasure to meet you, Murray. I'm Veronica. Nice to meet you. Murray's been with the company for... how long now? Let's just say longer than any machines here. Now, Murray is a true craftsman. He's actually responsible for some of Cavendish's most famous handcrafted chocolates over the years. Well, so, what do you think of this new system? The machine doesn't know, it doesn't look right. How so? It's the same Easter basket, isn't it? Come here. Let me show you something. There's just no substitute for a Cavendish basket assembled by hand. And Murray here, he's the master. And here you go. It's stunning. Now, which one would you rather buy? The one Murray made, or the one the machine made? It's no comparison. You wanna try one? It's fun. Okay, sure. So, does the supervisor just supervise, or does he lead by example? Just curious. Are you asking me to make an Easter basket, Miss... I don't know your last name. It's Ca... Do you need something for that? Sorry, it's just dry in here, it's Erinson. I'm Veronica Erinson. Well, Miss Veronica Erinson, today, I will lead by example. So the bunny goes in the centre, then we'll grab some chocolate eggs and sprinkle them all over, just kind of let them fall like that. And then some toy eggs? That's right. On the sides. Don't forget the chick pops. Don't forget the carrots for the bunny. That's right. Flowers. As old fashioned as it is, I like the Cavendish Easter basket. I always have. Me too. But the bunny ties it all together. Personally, I think it's one of the best milk chocolate products that we have. Really? Yeah. And I have my PhD in chocolate. From Chocolate University? Yes, Chocolate University, that's right. Actually, I went to culinary school in Oregon. And now you work in chocolate? Well, it was at school that I fell in love with it. Growing up here you kind of take it for granted, but at school, I saw chocolate in a whole different light. The artistry of it, the creativity and the craftsmanship. To be able to create something of... pure beauty. That's chocolate to me. Beauty to all the senses. Touch, sight, smell, and sound. Sound? Do you want to try another one? Sure. Yeah. This food is delicious. I've been meaning to ask you. What was it like working with my dad? Foster? Hard worker. Eager to know every aspect of the factory. That's why he was the natural choice to take over the company when your granddad passed away. I never really got to know my grandpa. Before Mr. Cavendish opened the factory, he had this little cart, and he sold chocolate door to door. He was so happy to see the kids with their smiling faces. Two of those smiles were ours. Your granddad knew way back then that chocolate is more than the taste. It's about being a part of people's lives, their families and traditions. It's about making memories. Too bad they don't make the legendary Cavendish Eggs anymore, now that was something. We were having that chocolate on our first date, right hun? You bet. I remember those. I used to love them as a little girl. They were so big and beautifully painted, with all those coloured jellybeans and... they were a real work of art. With a surprise toy inside. Yes! I haven't seen one in forever. But I'm embarrassed to ask, but why did, why did they stop making them? They were made meticulously by hand. Took too much time. And things have changed. The market has changed. We have a plastic replica on display at the museum. You know, we're hosting an Easter egg decorating class there this weekend. Why don't you stop by. Maybe I will. So the file marked "Easter Rollout?" Yes, just go ahead and forward it to everyone, with my usual closing. And can you email me some options for office chairs? Good ones. Well, I'll tell you about it later. I... I have to go right now, I am actually about to visit the Cavendish chocolate museum. I love that place. Two years ago, I visited with my... Hey, Parker. You work on weekends too? Yeah, sometimes there's just too much to catch up on. Yes, too much. Way too much. Did you give Erin my message? Have you seen her? She's gone. Marketing conference. I didn't hear anything. Super last minute. That's not her on the phone, is it? It's my mom, dad. My parents. I'm talking to my parents. You know, did she say anything about display graphics? Something about display graphics. Tell him I went with pink and blue. You know. I think she said something about pink and blue. She did. Great. Thank you. You're doing great, Parker. Thanks for everything. That was stressful. You like what you see? I didn't mean to scare you. No, it's fine, I was just... looking at the egg. What do you think? I wish I could see a real one. I was thinking the same thing. Anyways, if you're wondering why a grown man is carrying little jars of paint around... No, no. I... I think it's a charming look. I'm actually here for the egg decorating class. Great. That's why I'm here. Really? Yeah. Just through that door. This is great. Meet all of our modern-day Michelangelos. How's it going, sweetie? - Good, Dad. - Yeah? That looks good. Veronica, this is my daughter, Madison. Hi Veronica. Hi, Madison. It's nice to meet you. I'm covered in paint. I can see that. You look like you've been hard at work. You can tell an artist is at work by the amount of paint that's not on the canvas. Or the egg. What do you guys think of my egg? I think it's absolutely great, hun. Yeah, I love it. Yeah, the colours remind me of spring flowers. I wanted to put a butterfly in the middle, but I'm not the best at drawing them. Well, could I help you? Yeah, sure. Okay. What colour? Should we do purple? Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Butterflies are my favourite. Mine too. Because they're pretty? That, and because they start out as one thing... And then end up as something else. Exactly. A beautiful butterfly. That one has glitter in it. Well then, we have to use that one. Yeah. Beautiful. So, did you have fun, Maddie? Sure did. And did you have fun, Veronica? Sure did. Hey, Erin? Veronica! Veronica? I think she's talking to you. Come see this. It looks so good. It sure does. I want one. Well, we don't make those anymore sweetie. We had to retire them. Why? Well, sometimes the world moves too fast and people just want things right away. But it's so beautiful. Can't argue with that. Ms. Enwright? You wanted to see me? Yes, please, come in, sit down. If this is about me sampling the chocolates, I was... That's not why you're here. Saturday is the annual Sweetwater Chocolate Exchange. It's a time when people around town and the surrounding areas get together and share each other's homemade spring themed chocolate. And there's an egg relay for the kids. That sounds great. Cavendish sponsors the events, so I need two employees to walk around and represent the company and hand out chocolate. Flo is one, she has a flair for these things, and she requested you to join her. Me? Is there another Veronica Erinson I don't know about? So, what do you say? Yes. Count me in. Good. Hi. Try a caramel cluster, you'll love it. Hi. This is so exciting. My first Sweetwater Chocolate Exchange. You'll love it. Hi. What are they doing here? Chaz and Trent, they're the owners of Chocmate, this trendy new chocolate company. I see them on social media. That's our pecan prosciutto. Well, everybody from Sweetwater and surrounding areas are welcome. Their factory is an hour away, I guess that counts as "surrounding". Ladies and gentlemen, these are gonna be the best chocolates you've ever had in your life. They're really good with people. Please, give it a try. Excellent. Watch this. Hey, Betty. Ladies, hi! How are you ladies doing on this beautiful Sweetwater afternoon? Good, thank you. You need to try this. It's from our new spring mint collection. Mint isn't really my cup of tea. Me neither, to be honest. Sometimes it can be pretty strong, but a Cavendish mint is subtle like a soft spring breeze. A breeze, you said? A breeze. What did I tell you? Help yourselves. Have that one there. Thank you! Bye, ladies. Bye. Flo, you are a natural with people. You should be in sales. Thanks, but honestly I've tried. I applied to corporate a few times, but heard nothing back. That doesn't seem right. Hey. Hey. Madison is playing with some friends, so I was going to walk around, sample some of the wares of our fellow chocolatiers. You wanna join? I think he's talking to you, girl. I can handle flying solo. No corporate talk, I promise. Okay. Shall we? Okay, now, these are Miss Gillingham's spring chickens. Now, they are world famous in Sweetwater. She switches up the ingredients every year. I'm getting creme de cacao, a little bit of orange zest, and just a... just a flutter of amaretto. You got all that from one bite? You just need to open up your heart, and listen to what the chocolate's telling you. It's that easy? That's what Gabriel Belanger says. The chocolatier? One of the world's best chocolatiers. It's always been a dream of mine to go to Switzerland and study with him at his school. It's never too late. Maybe. This is old Bill Wallham's recipe. Your turn. No, no, no, no. You have to close your eyes. It helps focus your taste buds. Okay, so you're getting... I'm trying to open my heart and listen to the chocolate. I'm getting strong notes of... chocolate. Very funny. Just trust your senses. Trust what you're feeling. There's a touch of... Touch of what? It's like, a smokiness? Yeah. That's the chipotle. Really? It's his trademark. See, all you had to do was just trust your feelings. Okay, everyone. Time for the Easter relay game. Gather out back. On your marks... She looks so excited. She is. Get set! We've been practicing at home. Go! Yeah, you can do it! Okay, you got it! Come on, Maddie! Here ya go, honey! Come on Maddie! Get it, get it, get it! Get it, get it! Daddy, how did I do? You did amazing, sweetheart. I finished second, it was so much fun. That was so exciting! Great job. Thanks. I'm gonna take Madison for some iced tea, if that's okay. Yeah, that'd be great. Way to go, hun. It was so much fun! I was like that far away from winning. That was intense. Fun, but intense. Yeah. An egg, spoon, a race. Sometimes the best things are the simplest. I really like it here. Is it your first time in Sweetwater? I was here when I was 10, but we were just passing through. Well, it's a great place to grow up, raise a family. Bryan... I heard about your wife. I'm sorry. Thank you. I've been very fortunate to have such a supportive family and community, so I feel like I'm starting to turn a corner. I was lucky to meet her too, though. You always hope that you just find someone that brings out the best in you. Gives you that spark, that trust. I hope I'm not getting too personal. No, I don't, I don't mind. Now, what about you? What's that saying, what's your story? My story? I'm... I'm not that interesting. I might disagree with you. Where do I start? How about at the beginning? Yeah, that makes sense. I was born in Seattle, and I don't know if this is true, but apparently on the day that I was born, it rained so much that it broke the Seattle record for most rain in one day. Really? That's a lot of rain. When I was little, my mom would tell me that it was a good sign because I just had to shine a little bit brighter to get through the clouds. That's nice. I was raised in Seattle and then I went away for college. Chocolate University? I applied but I didn't get in. I went to college, on the East Coast. And after school, I... I tried a few different jobs, different cities, but I never really got attached to anything, or anyone. Still finding yourself? That's all right. My dad kept nudging me to join the family business, but I just, I wasn't sure if it was right for me. I... I wanted to be my own person, make my own path, but... it's kind of hard to make your own path when you don't know where you're going. I can relate. You know, right now it might not seem like it's your dream job, but maybe it's just a stepping stone to something else. You are meant to be here. I truly believe that. Hey, guys. Can I Interest you in a chocolate? Bryan, right? Head chocolatier at Cavendish? We met at the chocolate convention in Spokane last year. Right. Chaz and Trent. I'm Trent, he's Chaz. Sorry. It's nice to meet you guys again, you're doing some interesting things over there. Is that a compliment? Not sure, can't tell. This is my friend, Veronica. We work together at the factory. Nice to meet you. So, care to try? This one's called "Spring Heat". No, I've already tried that one, it's got a lot of... I'll try it. I've been learning a lot about chocolate. ...habanero peppers. You okay? I'll be right over. Listen, Bryan. We actually came to the exchange for a few reasons. We're looking for a new head chocolatier. We can't do everything ourselves anymore. Our new VP said you'd be a great choice. Very artistic. Right. You mean the VP that you poached, and now you're going for two? Like a good chocolate, can't stop at just one. We'd offer you almost complete creative control. We're new, but we like being in first place. Second just doesn't cut it. And let's face it, the Cavendishes are living in the past. We look to the future. Call us sometime, but don't wait too long. Hey. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine. How are you? I have never drank so much iced tea in my entire life. But I think the fire is finally out. Daddy? Can you ask her? About the petting zoo? She has been wanting to tell you... Did you know that our very own Madison Bailey has landed the coveted role as Easter Bunny in the Easter festival pageant? What? That's amazing. Congratulations. I need to work on my hop. She wants to do some character research. Yes. At the petting zoo tomorrow. So, will you come too? I would love to. We're all gonna have so much fun. She's really getting in there. I think she's trying a method acting approach. Pretty soon she'll be eating nothing but carrots. Daddy, I won't be eating carrots. Everybody knows bunny rabbits eat mostly grass and hay. I have been educated. Schooled, as they say. Right. Are you planning on going to the Easter festival at town square? This year I volunteered to be the egg hunt Grand Marshal. Hey. It is a big responsibility. I hadn't really thought that far ahead. Is it okay? Very proud of you, honey. You're gonna knock it out of the park. I still have to finish my costume. She's making her own bunny costume from scratch. No shortcuts for this little girl. Veronica, will you help me finish it? It's just the ears and tail. Maddie! The most important part. That's true. Daddy's great at almost everything... Except for sewing? I didn't say it. Look, Veronica, you don't... I have done plenty of sewing in my time. I would love to. Yes! Look, Daddy. They have goats. I saw that. Good morning. Morning. Morning Flo. I've never seen somebody so happy to go to work. Well, it's spring, and everything's in bloom. So, automation seems to be going well. Love the new designs, they pop. I want you two to meet someone. Don't be so shy. Carter Darren. Director of operations at Cavendish in Seattle. He tours the facility a few times a year, but today was a surprise. Yes. A little impromptu visit. Just seeing if things are ship shape for our Easter roll out. Big day is less than a month away. This is Florence Baker. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. And, this is Veronica Erinson. What are you doing? Organizing box... Please, Veronica. I would like you to meet Carter. Wait, Carter Darren? The Carter Darren? Erin? ...son. Yes. I'm Veronica Erinson. Wait. You're here? She's a transfer from Iowa. I really admire some of the things you've implemented here. That buttery bunny machine is a dream, but the Easter basket machines, they have some problems. Sorry, I'm... I'm really confused here. Well, maybe I could explain things to you, in the other room, by the machine. Yeah. Okay. Undercover? Undercover? And you've been down here the whole time? Yeah. No wonder Parker's been giving me the runaround. She's not. I've been running the marketing department from here with Parker's help. What have you found out? Lots of things. For starters, communication problems between the factory staff and the main office. You met Flo. She's amazing at sales, yet every time she applies for a job, no one at the main office gets back to her. And Susan's been asking for a new office chair but no one listens. That has to affect morale. Yeah, but that's not our biggest issue. I think our sales problems might be stemming from our automation strategy. I'm serious. Our Easter basket machine, it doesn't make the Easter baskets as nicely. Well, it's a new prototype, the first of its kind. Of course there's going to be growing pains. What about our cocoa bean sorter? Maybe if we had more real eyes on the cocoa beans, less duds would get into the product. Maybe our chocolate doesn't taste as good anymore. Okay. You may have figured a few things out, you gonna come back to the office now? I feel like I have so much work to do on my report. Like, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Fine, but I wouldn't stay much longer. What are you thinking about? Lyla, I really like it here. Well, Sweetwater does that to people. And I'm learning so much about the family business. But? I'm just sensing a but in there. But... It's this whole double life thing. I'm gonna have to come clean eventually, right? With everything, with everyone. With Bryan. That's up to you. You seem to like spending time with him. So, say I tell him the truth, and he's so upset that he never talks to me again. But more importantly, he's already been through so much. I don't wanna hurt him. So, maybe I don't have to. How? I don't tell him the truth, and I finish my commitments in town, and I leave Sweetwater. Sounds like you have a choice to make. Bryan, this is amazing. Just a little something I whipped up. What is it? It's Madison's favourite, it's a... White chocolate buttercream. I'm sorry, I don't speak mouthful-of-chocolate. I can translate for you. It is a white chocolate buttercream. Fresh butter from a local farm, and I used vanilla pods instead of extract. So good. You just made this up? I have a whole stack of these recipes that I wanna try, but with my position with the company right now, they're just kind of collecting dust. But we get to taste test them. That's a pretty sweet fringe benefit. All right, I'm gonna leave you guys to it, got some work to do. Have fun. You're really good at sewing. Aw, thank you. I had a good teacher. Who was that? My mom. You know dads are really good at teaching things too. Yeah. My dad's the best. I believe that. Tail me. All right. Let's put it there, then. Do you wanna try? Sure. Okay. Let me show you how. It's just like a bunny going in and out of a hole. The bunny goes down into the hole, and then up out of the hole. You try. The bunny goes down through the hole, and the bunny comes back up. Very good. See, that's sewing. You got it! Now you know how to sew. And we are all done. It's so good, thank you! You look so cute. You are gonna be the cutest bunny there. What is that? Madison likes to call it "Hippity Hop Fizz". It's a mix of orange juice, cranberry, strawberry puree, the ice cubes are made from pineapple juice, and the fizz... it's a secret. Actually, it's club soda. To spring, and new beginnings. This is delicious. Madison has made it an Easter morning tradition, especially when we do our egg hunt around the house. So you're the Egg Marshal at home too. That's very impressive. Did you do this drawing, Bryan? I just jot down ideas from time to time. I wish I could do that. You're very talented. Wouldn't go that far. And too modest. Okay, I will take "talented" but let's leave out the very, deal? Deal. All right. You know, it's late. I agree. I should probably go. Listen, thanks for everything that you've been doing with Maddie. It was... it was just sewing. No, it's so much more than just sewing. She said that she considers you a real friend. Bryan... I... What? Veronica, I made this for you. She's been working on it since yesterday. I did it all by myself. To thank you. Daddy says people love handmade things. Right Daddy? That's right. Well, your daddy's right. Handmade gifts are the best. Thank you. I love it. You're welcome. And you can decorate it any way you want. Veronica? Is everything okay? Never better. Are you leaving? Yes. Thank you for the juice, thank you for this beautiful egg. Can I borrow these drawings? Is that okay? I promise I'll bring it back. Sure. I'm not worried about it. Thank you. Bye! I think she likes my egg. The legendary Cavendish Egg. We bring back the greatest Easter chocolate that ever was. I don't know, Veronica. We're gonna make it bigger and more beautiful than ever before. And you can pitch it to management. Me? Yes, you. Unless there's another Bryan Bailey that I don't know about. I know that with your creativity and chocolate expertise, it will be a huge hit. It's only three weeks until Easter. So? We are having a hard-enough time making our quota as it is, let alone making a new chocolate. Bryan, it is... Besides, management would never go for it. They never listen to my ideas. You sure about that? Yes, I am sure. Well, then, we'll just have to figure it out together. See? I knew you would come around. Do you really think they'll go for it? Think about it. All these new chocolate companies like Chocmate are popping up with their modern, trendy takes. Like green tea chocolate, cucumber, peanut and ketchup. Really? Okay, well, I made that last one up. But, we go the other direction. Back to tradition, back to what made Cavendish great. We still do our current line, but with a little retro wow factor. The legendary Cavendish Egg. Can I be honest with you? Always. Before you even mentioned this, I've been thinking about this for weeks. Great minds. Yeah. And hear me out. Okay. Instead of putting a toy inside, we put a butterfly. Butterfly. A white chocolate buttercream butterfly, from your own personal recipe. We paint the wings pink and purple, the colours of Easter. Sounds beautiful. Because the butterfly is the symbol of spring. Renewal. Change. Which is exactly what we want to do with this company. We could have a whole collection of surprises. Because it's what's on the inside that counts. So, where do we start? How about at the beginning? That makes a lot of sense. This is a beautiful drawing, Bryan. But Easter's less than three weeks away, and I'm just the factory manager here, I can't green light a new chocolate. So you're saying we're going to have to go through Carter. Probably, yes. Unless we go through someone else, like the director of marketing. Really? Yes. That's an idea. Marketing and operations often work hand in hand. That's right. That's interesting. Currently, Erin Cavendish is the director of marketing. I heard she's very good, and really smart. I heard that too. Actually, I have her cell number in my company index here. I could give her a call right now. Now? Yeah. No, no, no, no. No sense waiting. I agree. Let's not waste any time. It's ringing. Well, she's not answering. Probably in a meeting or something. Voicemail. Hello, Miss Cavendish, this is Susan Enwright. Factory manager here at the Sweetwater plant. I have two very talented employees who have a great idea. I didn't know Erin was going undercover? Sir, I feel like at the very least I should've been told about this. I wanted to keep it between Erin and me. What can she tell you that I can't? I did a recent tour of the Sweetwater plant and phase one is going very well. Erin has a different opinion. Sir, I've been at this company for six years. I care about what we've built and what we will build. I want this company to grow, and I want to grow with it. Phase two, 50 percent automation. I've got a team ready to go in this weekend, I just need the green light. I'll make a decision after Erin finishes her assignment. I'd like to hear her full report. Fair enough. You know my position. What do you think, Pop? Are we ready for this? Good news. I just got an email from Erin Cavendish. You have a presentation 10:00 AM Wednesday morning at Cavendish Headquarters in Seattle. What? That's incredible. That's amazing. Congrats, you deserve it. Me, what about you? You'll be presenting to the entire board. Wow, Susan. Thank you. Don't thank me, thank Erin Cavendish. Wherever she is. Okay, so Wednesday. That doesn't give us that much time, but... We can do it. Well, sounds like you have an egg to make. Better get cracking. Nice work, Miss Erinson. Excellent work, Mr. Bailey. - Thank you, Murray. - Thank you, Murray. You're welcome. I'm going to bed. It looks beautiful, you two. Break a leg. Thanks. Good night. I think the presentation's gonna go great. Let me know if you need help with any of the prep. Help with the prep? You're doing it with me. Bryan, you're the creative. You should do the pitch. No, no, no, no, no, no, no... I can't go in front of the entire board. Yes, you can. We're a team. We did this together, we're going in there together. No debate. I hope everyone got the undercover memo. Veronica Erinson from Sweetwater is our Erin Cavendish. And Bryan doesn't know that Veronica is Erin? Correct. Got it. I'm gonna need another cup of coffee. I wonder if Erin Cavendish will be in there. I... I don't know how to answer that. I know she's really busy, but I wanna thank her. I've never met her, but I somehow feel that she's responsible for this. Bryan... This is probably the worst timing ever, but... I'm not who you think I am. Veronica, what are you talking about? If this is about presenting to the room, I can do most of the talking. That's not what I mean... We're ready for you now. Okay. After you. Bryan is gonna start us off. Walk us through the creative side of this chocolate as well as some of the inspiration behind it. Bryan? Thank you, Veronica. Creatively, the legendary Cavendish Egg is a return to the kind of artisan and handcrafted chocolates that we are famous for. The milk chocolate base is covered in vibrant Easter colours and jellybeans. But we have added a modern flourish. These icing sugar flowers really highlight the seasonal spirit. Nice intro Bryan, but I have a question. Yes? Can we eat it? We thought you'd never ask. Yeah, let's crack it open. This is one of the most delicious chocolates I've ever had. Please try a bite. And this is a white chocolate buttercream butterfly. And it goes inside... instead of a toy. I can eat this? You bet you can. And there's an opportunity to put other chocolate animal surprises inside if we get the go-ahead. If? I thought we talked about when. Ha, Bryan, you remind me of one of my favourite sayings. Confidence is the stepping stone to achievement. And Er... And err on the side of caution is also what you're saying? Be bold but stay within yourself. Yes, yes, that's exactly what I'm saying, thank you. Veronica. I'll be honest. I like this product, but a return to artisan chocolate runs counter to... Not all chocolates will be made this way, just certain special ones. To celebrate the history. The Cavendish history, which we have a lot of. And to be honest, we like your move to update the Sweetwater factory. You do? The production efficiency of the new machines will permit us to repurpose the employees lost on the assembly line. Free them up. To make more handcrafted chocolates? And get the best of both worlds. We can have our buttery bunnies and eat them too. But we are confident that people are going to love this product. Which will renew interest in the entire Cavendish lineup like never before. Is marketing here? Yes? Parker, can we run the analytics on rebooting classic content? Absolutely. Well, thank you very much, Veronica and Bryan. Since we're tight on time, you'll be hearing from us by tomorrow morning. - Either way. - Thank you, Veronica, Bryan. Thank you. Hey, we did it. Yeah, I don't even care if this gets green lit, I'm just... I'm so happy right now. I'm glad, Bryan. Really, I am. Hello? Hi, Bryan. It's Chaz and Trent from Chocmate. Hope you don't mind us calling you at home. Not at all. How are the spring chocolates coming? It depends. Are we speaking to our new head chocolatier? Look, I really appreciate the offer, but I don't think that right now is the best time to make a change. Well, you could always leave 'em after the spring rush. We'd love to run some ideas by you for our summer line. Tell him about Ocean Wave. Ocean Wave, Bryan. A salted seaweed chocolate with salt harvested straight from the Pacific. And we'll churn 'em out faster than you can say walla-walla-Washington. We were very impressed, I'll be honest. Well then, we'll have to make it. Well, you know I'd like to, but time is tight, and we've gotta have Carter on board. You know how it works, Erin. We do things right. I know, I know. You and Bryan make quite a team. You mean Veronica and Bryan. Dad, I've decided that I'm gonna tell Bryan who I really am. Tomorrow. This has been going on too long, and I can't lie to him anymore. I realize that it might not go over well. Sounds like you're doing the right thing. I'm proud of you. Thanks, Dad. Bye. Morning. I have a new office chair. Really? You're kidding! Susan Enwright. Hi Carter. There you are. Susan. Have you seen Bryan? I have some great news. They decided to do the Cavendish Egg. Really? That's amazing! It's less than three weeks till Easter, but I know we can do it. Carter told me how we'll make it work. We begin this afternoon. Thank you. Have you told Bryan yet? No, but he should be here shortly. We have a quick meeting. If you don't mind, I... I would really love to tell him myself. Of course! Mum's the word. And did I tell you? I got a new chair, just out of the blue! Everything's coming up spring. What a great surprise. I think that we should be good for the buttery bunnies, but... We might be a little late on the marshmallow lilies. What is it? Do you notice anything? You got a new chair. Look at this, it's got wooden arms, a cushy seat. Hey. Wanna take it for a spin? Sure. Oh dear. Looks like it's all right. This one is... Bryan! Bryan! I just spoke with Susan, they green lit our egg. They're making our egg! I thought you would be more excited. I wish I could be, Erin. That is your name, right? Bryan, I... Yeah. I saw a photo of you and your dad in Susan's office, and pictures don't lie, do they? Just tell me the truth, I wanna hear it from you. Yes. I'm Erin Cavendish. Okay, so this is just some kind of practical joke? No! I... I wanted to tell you sooner. Why did you do all of this? To see how things work from the inside. This was just a business idea. I never expected for things to get so... Personal? Yes, if I'd come in here with you knowing who I was from the start, you never would've been honest with me. But you wanna talk about honesty? Okay. What was that whole charade in the boardroom? Everyone was in on it? You know you guys sure have a funny way of doing business. Okay, look. We... we took things too far. I feel like a fool. I never wanted to hurt you. It's too late for that, Erin. You know now, now they're rolling out the legendary egg. And it's not because of the presentation, it's because you're a Cavendish. It had nothing to do with me. It had everything to do with you. You shined in there. Everyone could see it. The design was all yours. You know, I got a job offer from Chaz and Trent over at Chocmate. Head chocolatier. I'm not a big fan of their chocolate, I'm actually thinking about taking it. The only thing that was keeping me from saying yes was this company, this family, your family and everything that they've built. Yeah, I actually started to think that things were turning around for me here. You made me believe that, you made me believe in myself, and now... I don't know what to believe, so maybe I should just take that job. Daddy. Are we ever gonna see Veronica again? I'm not sure honey. It's a... Well, it's a long story. But her real name is Erin. I don't understand. Well, to tell you the truth, neither do I. But she's still the same person, right? What do you mean? Well, I'm playing the Easter Bunny in the pageant, but it's just a costume. I'm still me. Erin, we need you. Our social media platforms need you. Well, I am not feeling all that social these days. We need a great campaign to go along with our Cavendish Egg release. I am all out of ideas. That's not you. You tell us at marketing all the time, there's always a story, and you just need to be inspired by it. What inspired you in Sweetwater? I'm standing outside the Cavendish Chocolate Company's flagship store in Seattle, where customers are lined out the door. Why? It seems everything old is new again, with the relaunch of the hugely popular legendary Cavendish Egg. The demand for this Easter treat is extremely high, not just in Seattle, but across the country. Thanks to an effective marketing campaign. And... great chocolate. Back to you, Colin. It's a smashing success. Your granddad would be so proud, and your mom too. I'm glad that people really connected with the campaign. It always starts with people. And a great product. I have you to thank for that. And Bryan. Yes, and Bryan. Why don't you talk to him? I don't think he ever wants to talk to me again. I think he might come around. Dad, I have a question to ask you, and I want you to be honest with me. Of course. What was the real reason that you sent me down to Sweetwater? What did you see? All sorts of things. How we make chocolate. The people who make it. And what did you see in yourself? I saw sides of myself, sides that I didn't even know were there. Or maybe they were there all along, and they just needed time to grow. I think that answers your question. You may have answered mine, too. The return of the legendary Cavendish Egg is a legendary success. So thank you everyone. But. Easter is a time for surprises. As you know, we have a high-level position in our company that is currently vacant, and I think I found a replacement. I'm proud to announce as our new Senior VP, Erin Cavendish. Thank you everyone. I'm so flattered and honoured. I... I wasn't expecting this, to be honest. After these past few weeks, I know that this company is not just where I'm meant to be, but where I want to be. I'm proud to be a Cavendish. Ninety years ago, my grandfather came to Sweetwater, Washington with nothing but a suitcase and a dream. And that dream is still with us today. And I'm excited to see where we can take it from here. So, if I may. I would like to add, our success is a reflection of everyone here at team Cavendish. So, I would like to thank Carter, for seeing what I was seeing, and for being instrumental in bringing this project to the finish line. But more importantly, and he's not here, but I would like to thank Bryan. Bryan Bailey. Without his creativity and confidence... Anyway. Thank you to Bryan, our talented chocolatier. And there were... there were others, names you may know, and many you don't, who helped me along the way. So I'd like to recommend a few changes. Hey, I heard. Lead decorator on handmade chocolates? Congrats. Thanks. Yes! Hey, Flo. Hey, Veronica. Erin. Miss Cavendish. Erin is fine. Congratulations on your new position. Thank you. But I'm afraid I have some news. We'd like to transfer you. Transfer? Somewhere else in the factory? Or Iowa? Seattle. I'd like to promote you to Associate Sales Manager at our main office. What?! Thank you so much. You deserve it, Flo. ...I still think I stand a chance. Take care. Hey, Bryan. Happy Easter. Happy Easter. This is really something. I'm glad that I could get down to see it. Yeah. Congratulations on the company's success, and being named Senior VP. I heard. Yes. Thank you. But, the egg's a hit because of you. I... I wanted to... You don't have to thank me. What I'm trying to say is, it's wonderful that people love what we created, and I want to be able to celebrate that success, but it was wrong of me to pretend to be someone else. But these past few weeks, I learned more about myself by being Veronica than I ever knew about myself as Erin, if... if that even makes sense. And while I learned so much of that from being here in Sweetwater, I learned most of that from you. By seeing how you are with Madison, and your passion and creativity about chocolate, but... Most of all, from how you are with me. You bring out the best in me, and we make a good team, in so many ways. Can I be honest? Always. You're not the only one who's been pretending. You bring out the best in me, and... I think I'm falling in love with you. I'm falling in love with you too. But I should warn you. One of my first decisions as SVP is to launch an entirely new line of hand-crafted Cavendish holiday classics for all the upcoming seasons. The teaser is, if you thought Easter was legendary... Just wait until you see Halloween? Exactly! But not so fast. You're gonna need some training. Training? Yes. My director of production and head chocolatier will want to expand his horizons. I'm sending you to Switzerland for three weeks in the summer to study chocolate making with Gabriel Belanger. Are you serious? Yes! Bryan Bailey! Mr. Cavendish. Congratulations on your new position. Long time coming. Thank you, sir. I did it! I did it. I found something really special. I think I did too, sweetie. Erin! I'm so glad you came back for all the fun. Well, I wouldn't have missed it for the world. I'm sorry that I wasn't honest about myself. That's okay. It's only a name. I know who you really are. And I was thinking about Switzerland, that maybe I would come with you. I hear it's lovely in the summer. Are we going to Switzerland? You bet we are, sweetheart! Daddy told me they make the best chocolate there. Well, maybe the second best. It's time for the Easter Pageant. The pageant. Come on!
