Looking back at my past may have caused this. For some, the past is like a coast they glance from afar while they sail away. [upbeat music playing] [indistinct chatter] [Lilia] For me, the past is like a long chain. [speaking in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [upbeat music playing] [panting] [groaning] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [grunting] [crying] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [screaming] [in Hokkien] [doctor laughs] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [sighs] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [sighing] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [suspenseful music playing] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [sobbing] [in Hokkien] [sobbing] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [Lilia in Tagalog] She gave me away to be able to survive. This is a recurring theme in my life. It's unfortunate when culture and history meddle with your life. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [sobbing] [Lilia in Tagalog] In China, culture and history are the reasons I left my family. And in the Philippines, after so many years, history once again mediates how I live my life. [in Taglish] I have been the voice of the Chinese-Filipino community. [in Tagalog] But I just found out that I am the one who needs a voice for something I have been avoiding. [in English] The PNP honors Lilia Chong Yang with the Plaque of Appreciation. [crowd applauding] -Thank you. -Congratulations. Next month, you'll be seeing less of me because I will be passing on the crusade to the younger member of our group. -As I go into semi-retirement. -[camera shutters clicking] [in Tagalog] Thank you again to all of you. [crowd applauding] -Let's go get photos with the officers. -Okay. [door creaks] [in Taglish] I thought this was just a recognition ceremony? Since the press is already here… we are presenting the 4th batch of police officers who are involved in the raid operation in Chinatown. [camera shutters clicking] [in English] I really have to go. [in Taglish] It's my child's graduation. [in Tagalog] Thank you again. -[in English] Thank you. -Thank you. [crowd applauding] -[imitates gunshot] -[man grunts] [in Tagalog] Hey, stop! [upbeat music playing] [crowd applauding] [upbeat music playing] [crowd applauding] -[crowd applauding] -[upbeat music playing] Good thing Lisa hasn't been called. But Anciano's showing off again. [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] [in English] Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce first to everybody the valedictorian of batch 2004. Eliza Chong Yang. [in Mandarin] Let's put our hands together to welcome her. [cheering, applauding] [light music playing] [in English] Thank you. [cheering, applauding] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Oh, Papa. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] -[in Tagalog] I got it on camera! -Gotcha! -Bravo! Bravo! -I saw him, too! He's so handsome! -I got him on camera. Look. -Let me see. -Wait. Wait. -He's First Honorable mention. [Eliza] He's just my fan. Why are you ganging up on me again? [in Taglish] Because you are the star of the moment. Eliza. Star. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Eliza, what's important is you do what you want to do. Stand for it. [in Hokkien] Let's raise our glasses. [in Hokkien] -Cheers. -Cheers. [in Taglish] And let us also toast to the 25th wedding anniversary of you and Paul. [in Tagalog] It's coming! [all in English] Happy anniversary! [in Taglish] There are many cute items for your wedding anniversary at the shop I went by. [in Hokkien-Tagalog] [in English] That's two months from now, you don't have enough time. [in Tagalog] We can do that on our vacation. You're coming with me, right? -I'll take care of it. -[sighs] -[chuckles] -[in Taglish] That's my sister-in-law. -She's very persistent. -[giggles] Look at Ruth. She was sexy before. [in Tagalog] Now, she's gotten fat! -Look at me. I look so young. -[giggles] I looked funny. [both laughing] Good thing you kept a copy of this. You can have that one. I have two copies. Look at Paul. He looked so serious. [in Taglish] I don't do anything but organize our reunion for next year. [in Tagalog] Look at Michael. He's so handsome! I wonder where he is today. Maybe he's already dead. Mm. [giggles] [in Taglish] I became your student in Math and Economics. [in Tagalog] Paul Yang is my husband. [in Taglish] He was also your student. [in English] Lilia Chong-Yang. Anti-crime crusader, sir. [in Tagalog] She was a former activist. She was with Paul Yang. Michael Lim, Jonathan Talag… [in Taglish] Do you remember me, sir? I was just here last week. Lilia… [Paredes] Lilia Chong. -[both laugh] -[in English] Block 1. [in Tagalog] You are correct, sir. [in Taglish] Sir, our batch has an upcoming reunion. [in Tagalog] We would like you to join us. Where is Michael Lim? I think he is in the States, but we have no news of him. Sir, that was history. And they didn't end up with each other. Why? Why? [somber music playing] We're already here. We have to bring back the medicines. [Young Michael] Let's park here first. [in Taglish] There's a checkpoint! [somber music playing] Hey. You surprised me. -[smooches] -[giggles] [in Hokkien] [in Taglish] I don't want any disruption for our second honeymoon after the silver wedding ceremony. Hmm? [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Oh, please. [in Taglish] We have to have a vacation after our renewal of vows. It's only our 25th. We can do this on our 50th. By that time, we'll barely walk to the altar. [in Tagalog] We might not reach it. [chuckles] Okay. [in English] Okay, but we'll just make it simple. -Okay? -The children will take care of that. [in Tagalog] They're organizing it with Bernadette. -Is that okay with you? -Okay. [laughing] This is too much, Stephen. Your Papa and I don't need this. -[in English] Do you like it? -[in Tagalog] Too much. [in English] Can I get you and Mrs. Yang anything, sir? It's okay, May. [in Taglish] Looks like a prospective customer of ours needs assistance there. [in English] Thank you. [in Taglish] If it's your privilege, tell one of your salespeople to sell one. And then use the money for the sports spa you're planning to start. Ma, that money is not enough for my needed investment. [in Tagalog] Is this a bribe for me to talk to your father? It's okay if Dad won't let me borrow money. I don't want you to borrow from your dad. [in Taglish] How about in the bank? I can be your guarantor. [in Tagalog] What's the problem? [in Taglish] Your dad isn't vocal, but he's proud of you. Especially since you're independent and you don't depend on him. [in Tagalog] I'll just borrow from other people? Because you're obliged to pay to them. But I will pay Papa. That's the problem. He won't let you pay him. He will just give it to you. I don't want that. [engines revving] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [somber music playing] [in Tagalog] What is it? [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [somber music playing] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [In Tagalog] Are you sure? [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [elevator bell dings] [in English] Excuse me. -What can I do for you, ma'am? -Um. I'm a guest here and I would like to know if you have a guest here by the name of Michael Lim? Oh, yes. But wait. There are four Michael Lims listed here. Would you know which one? His middle initial is "S." The middle initials are not listed. I'm sorry. Perhaps he is listed under his Chinese name. He never uses his Chinese name. Um… He's tall, with straight hair. I'm sorry but I do not remember how the four Michael Lims looked like. -Okay, thank you. -You're welcome. [phone rings] Hello? Hello, who's this? Hello? Hello? [clacking] [woman on phone] Good evening, Mrs. Yang. Can I help you? Yeah. Someone just called. Could you tell me where the call came from? [woman] Is there a problem? Um… no. [woman] It's from within the hotel. Could you tell me from what room? Were you expecting a call, ma'am? No. [woman] I'm sorry, ma'am, for purpose of security, we cannot. Okay. It's all right. [in Tagalog] I never enjoy casinos. I would rather visit temples. [in Taglish] Mr. Hao will take us later to lunch. [in Tagalog] Can you go by yourself? I don't feel well. What's really happening? Oh, dear. Just explain it to Mr. Hao. [clicks] [cell phone ringing] [in English] Hello? [in Hokkien] [Lilia in Tagalog] I'm good. We're getting spoiled by our host. You don't tell me we have a reunion. I'm talking to Freida now. [in English] I'm sorry. I forgot. [in Taglish] Because that'll be for next year. Our batch has a fundraising event for those who are not in a good place. That's a good idea. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] When are you coming back? The day after tomorrow. I will just relax a bit more. [in English] Okay. I love you. -Love you. -[elevator dings] [clicking] [clicking continues] [elevator bell dings] [door thuds] [suspenseful music playing] [door thuds] [elevator bell dings] Wait! Down? No. [Lilia in Tagalog] I was like a crazy dog. At last, I finally saw what I've been looking for. And I won't stop until I'm sure it's him. [receptionist in English] Good morning, ma'am. Good morning. I'm from room 2208. And I asked you before about your guest by the name of Michael Lim. -Yeah, from 2208. -Yes. I think the guest I was looking for is on the 15th floor. Can you check if there's a Michael Lim on the 15th floor? -You must be Lilia Yang? -Yes. -Yes. -Someone left this one for you. Where is Wat Chaitararam Temple? Just around the corner. Take a tuktuk. -Thank you. -You're welcome. [in Tagalog] Are you feeling okay? You can come with us now? Um… I don't think I can come. I don't feel well. [in Taglish] Just tell Mr. Hao, maybe next time. [somber music playing] [somber music intensifies] [somber music continues] [chuckles] Who knew we'd meet here in Thailand? [chuckles] [both laughing] [Lilia in Tagalog] I had mixed feelings during that moment. I wanted to hug him for meeting him after a long time. And I wanted to slap him because he didn't come back for me. [in English] So… [in Tagalog] I'm getting old. No. -You still look the same as before. -[chuckles] You, too. [sighs] How many children do you have now? I have none. Mm. Do I know your wife? Dorothy. [in Taglish] She died last winter. The car she was driving fell from the cliff. [in English] I'm sorry. [in Tagalog] Paul and I ended up-- I know. [in Taglish] Our schoolmate told me when I met her in the States. [in Tagalog] Are you going to live here? I'd rather live in the Philippines. [in Taglish] I'll be going back to the States the day after tomorrow. -You really abandoned the Philippines. -Not really. I just think I have no reason to go back. [cell phone rings] -[in English] Excuse me. -Yeah. [cell phone ringing] [beeps] Hello? Paul… [Lilia] Guess who's here? [chuckles] Guess who's with me? [in Tagalog] He's been gone for so long. Who? [in Hokkien] [Lilia in Tagalog] Talk to him. [in English] Hello, Paul. Michael. Michael Lim. Michael? [in Tagalog] How are you? What are you doing there? [in Taglish] We have a business conference here in Thailand. But I'm based in New Jersey. [in Tagalog] I have a business there. [Paul] At last. You finally showed yourself. [in English] Anyway… [in Taglish] Just give Lilia your email address and mobile phone number. [in English] Okay. Hello, Paul. -[in Taglish] My flight is at 9:30 a.m. -Okay. Take care. Love you. [in English] I love you. [phone beeps] [light music playing] [in Tagalog] Now what? [in English] Let's keep in touch. Bye. Bye. [somber music playing] [Lilia in Tagalog] That's it. That's enough. Even though we didn't talk much. What's important is I saw him. He's alive. He saw me and he liked what he saw. That's just it. [somber music playing] [both laughing] Ouch! -[laughter] -[indistinct chatter] Come here. You'll get wet. [yelling] [both laughing] [Michael] Let's go. Come on. Pa, I asked for permission. [in Chinese accent] I don't want you to speak to me like that. You, Michael, leave. -Papa! -Don't talk! [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] That explains it. You finally said it. [Melencio] Lilia. Lilia! [in Hokkien] [in Mandarin] [engine revving] [brakes squeaking] [in Tagalog] Paul, good thing you took the van. -They didn't know I took it. Why? -Come. I don't want to go back. [in Taglish] He said she's not their real daughter. She just confirmed it now. [in Tagalog] What are we going to do now? It's almost curfew time. I just don't want to go back! What about your clothes? Where are you going to live? -Paul, can I borrow your van? -Are you crazy? You have no driver's license. -Just help me with this one. -Let me drive. Where are you going? Paul, give me the keys. Mike! Whenever I ask him how I was born, he always answers me differently. What's important is he treated you like his own daughter. Daughter? Is that how you treat a child? He always gets mad at every mistake I make. Lilia he became a widower just last year. You have to understand him. He acts like that because I'm not his blood. Can you stop being so narrow-minded? [engine revving] Where are we going? Where we should've gone. Why don't you listen to me? I don't want to go back! I said I don't want to go back! Why don't you respect my decision! -Mike, I don't want to go home! -You will go back to your family. He is your Papa. Not us. If you want to run away, let's just forget we're friends. [somber music playing] [somber music continues] You are a good person. You took Lilia back home. You're a good friend. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Pa… [in Hokkien] [somber music playing] -[in English] Sorry. -Oh, no, sorry. -It's my fault. -No, no, no. It was my fault. Let me help you. Okay. [in Hokkien] [in Taglish] I can tell by your accent. [in Hokkien] [in English] I'm Bernadette. Michael. [in Taglish] Wait. Souvenir. [chuckles] Okay. -Michael. -[in English] Smile. [camera shutter clicks] All right? [Michael in Taglish] I can't extend my vacation. There's no urgent need for me to extend. [in Tagalog] How about you? You're going back to the States, right? We have many things to talk about. Do we still need to? I have many questions. [Bernadette] Sis. [Lilia in English] Oh, I have to go. -Bye. -Bye. Let's go? Hi. [in Taglish] Good thing the concierge knows where you are. We might be late for the airport. -[in Tagalog] Let's go. -[in English] Okay. Bye! [engine revving] [Bernadette] Sis… [in Tagalog] What is it? Do you know the man you were talking to earlier? That's Michael. He's our friend. He's our former classmate. [sighs] He's handsome. He's older. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] His wife is lucky. He's a widower. [gasps] Really? God's really good! [chuckles] You're crazy, Bernie. [in Taglish] Give me his phone number and address. Please, sis. I don't want to grow old alone. [in Tagalog] Bernie, you're funny. Paul and I are his friends. The three of us were really close. That's even better. You guys know him. [flight attendant in English] Excuse me, ma'am, newspaper? Thank you. [in Tagalog] What's this? [officer] But only Delfin Nemencio has been released. But Nemencio is the mastermind. The witness is pointing at him. [in Taglish] The witnesses haven't signed any affidavits. That's Hao siao! Obviously, they're scared because they are against the police. What will happen to us? We might take a hit. Oh. -[crowd clapping] -Nice shot. Paul. Lilia and I met Michael. She said you knew him. Michael Lim. [in Taglish] Yes, he was our best friend from way back. [in Tagalog] Why don't I know him? [in English] You're the youngest. At that time, you were only two years old when Michael went to our house. He looks like a good person. How was he when you guys were together? [in Tagalog] He's smart and thoughtful. I think he's got all the good traits. Everyone likes him. Lilia and he used to be together. Oh, that's why. What do you mean? That's why he looks at Lilia that way, while she seems flattered. Don't say that to Lilia, okay? Why? I was there. I saw them. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] He really looks at her differently-- I said enough! Don't start an issue. Okay? See? Your things are a mess. There could be cockroaches. [chuckles] You love keeping old things. I will fix them, Papa. [light music playing] [door closes] [light music playing] -[Lilia giggles] -[upbeat music playing] Do you see the face of that old guy? Look! That one with his fist up. Mike, you must be hungry. You're seeing things. People say… [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Who's Ge Ha Lao Lan? They said he knows every newborn's name and who they're destined for. How does he know that? He ties the name of the baby boy on a red thread with the name of a baby girl on the other end. And then, they end up together. [Young Michael] Come. Let's go find out if the legend of Ge Ha Lao Lan is true. [Young Michael] This is just between us, our secret in front of God. [light music playing] [Young Michael in English] Make us husband and wife in your eyes and make our love for each other last forever. [Young Lilia] And Lord, I promise to cherish and treasure this gift of our love for each other until the day I die. [in Tagalog] What Ms. Lilia Chong Yang's group did was wrong. They don't have sufficient evidence. [man on TV] There are dirty cops but not all. I'm not one of them. He's shameless! [in Taglish] He's the mastermind! [in Tagalog] You shouldn't meddle with them. You already announced that you're retiring. Paul, they're calling me. I can't abandon my commitment. [in Taglish] You only focus on the issue before. [in Tagalog] But now you're targeting a person. He's a police officer. We might take a hit. We can't abandon our stance. We learned that from the movement, right? What I learned is everyone gets tired. It was different before. The problem is you don't want to leave the past. [in Taglish] By the end of the month, the reception hall should be finished. We don't want to give them a problem. This is our initiative, right? My contribution is I'm going to be the one to sing. Who prepared the list of invited guests? [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Who put Michael Lim here as a guest? Papa. [Lilia in English] I want the sales department to concentrate on the Filipinos abroad. [in Taglish] Many of them want to retire here in the Philippines. And we're sure they're going to pay for amortization. -Ma'am, your phone is ringing. -[cell phone rings] [beeps] [Lilia in English] Hello? -Hello? -[Michael] Hello, Lilia? -Who's this again? -[door closes] Lilia. Michael? [in Tagalog] I thought you were in the States? No. I'm here in the Philippines. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] I thought… Lilia, I can't stop thinking. We have many things to clear up. Can we meet? [in Hokkien] [Michael in Tagalog] I won't stay long here in the Philippines. I'm here in Tagaytay Highlands. Come here. Let's talk. Can you come? [Michael] Okay, Lilia. [Lilia in Tagalog] I'm mad at myself for being nervous. I can't get nervous. He's no one. He's my past. I'm meeting him because I want to tell him something. And to prove to myself that I can talk to him without fear. I want to prove that our past has no power over me. What's your name? -Sigmond Lee. -What's this? -What's that? -What's this? -Don't play dumb. -You're the prick! Sig? Sig! -We caught you red-handed! -What's happening here? Sir? -Sig! -They planted drugs on me. What? Sir, he's my friend. [in Taglish] We're supposed to meet here. He's not a drug pusher. -[in Tagalog] She's with him. -What? Sir, we don't do drugs! We can get tested. Sir, we're not bad people. If you don't want any inconvenience, pay us. I don't have money here but I have my ATM. Don't let them do this! [Paul in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] You deserve each other. Paul, we've been traveling. Park here. -We can't. It's dangerous if we park. -[siren wailing] Dude, there's a checkpoint! There's a checkpoint! [engine revving] What are we going to do? Go straight! Go, Paul! [Michael] What are we going to do? [Lilia] Just do it! Hurry! -Hey! -[gunshots] -Stop there. -[gunshots] -No! You're not going down! -I'm going down. We have a woman with us. -Stop the van, Paul! -You don't need to! -Slow down. Take care of Lilia! -No, Mike! -[Michael] See you! -[Lilia screams] -Mike! Come on! -[gunshots] -[siren wailing] -[grunts] -[police siren blaring] -Mike! Mike! [police siren blaring continues] Paul! Mike's hurt! [Lilia] That seems to be the last time Michael and I have seen each other. He's safe. His relatives said he can go out of the hospital now. I can't visit him? [in Hokkien] [Paul in Tagalog] It's dangerous. They said it's hard to get in. -There's a background check. -[Lilia sobbing] If it weren't for him… [Lilia] Because of trauma and fear for our family, we never came back to the movement. We never saw Michael and his family again. The fear of wiretapping stopped me from calling him. They left their mansion. They left the Philippines. -What do you need? -Nothing. [Lilia] Michael left me to be safe. My niece has no police record. We have evidence that they're together. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] You're ganging up because they're Chinese. Ma'am, we're just doing our job. These rich people thought they could get away… Isn't your mom answering? She's been out of reach. Whether she's Lilia Chong Yang or the President of the Philippines, call them. We will stand by what we said. Have you called the office? She's not there. What if we call Dad? [in Hokkien] [somber music playing] [light music playing] [in Tagalog] Thank you very much. -You came. -I can't stay long. This will be quick. I don't have the guts to tell you this the first time we saw each other. Lilia… What happened to us? That was a long time ago, Michael. Nothing will change. I told you I'm coming back for you. You never said anything. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] You never answered. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] When? Where? To the post office box that Paul told me about. So that the military won't find me. Paul knows where you were? We didn't meet. She said she'll drive by herself. Where did she say she's going? [in English] Sir, Director Anciano is here. Let him in. -Mr. Yang. -Thank you for your immediate response, Director Valero. I'm sorry for the mistake, Mr. Yang. [in Taglish] Your daughter Eliza and her friend Sigmond have been released. [in English] How about Lilia? [in Tagalog] Her driver said he doesn't know where she went. [in Taglish] So far there's been no report about any abduction on the field. [in Tagalog] Did someone already call? No one. [in Taglish] This is unusual. Her two cell phones are both turned off. [in English] She never leaves the office without telling me. [in Tagalog] Her employees said before she left, she was talking to somebody on the cell phone. They said she looked uneasy. It's not true that my wife died because of an accident. [in Taglish] She committed suicide. She found out that after all these years, you're still the one I love. [in Tagalog] Do you really have to tell me that? Is it wrong for you to know the truth? Circumstances broke us apart. -No one wanted that to happen. -That's the worst thing. I was forced into a life I didn't want. Michael, I need to go. Stay a bit longer. Stay with me. [Lilia] There are things that haven't changed in so many years. And these are your feelings about a person you truly love. There's a good side to meeting Michael again. This is knowing who I really am. [somber music playing] [Lilia] I stopped myself from wanting to embrace him and cry on his shoulders. I just prayed that we wouldn't give in to temptations while time is passing by. You got nervous, didn't you? [in Taglish] I told you I have a fear of heights. [in Tagalog] You never change. Not everything changes for a person. Michael, I might be late. One more. To go up. [light music playing] [Lilia] Lucky are those people who can choose who to be with until they grow old. If circumstances hadn't come between us, Michael would've been my husband. [light music playing] [light music continues playing] [Michael sobs] [sobbing continues] I changed my life. I didn't do anything. Come on. I am Lilia Chong Yang's son. Where is she now? Is she missing? That's right for her. Here. If you know something, tell me now. Your family's something. I got fired because of your mom, but still you're accusing me. I really wish she got kidnapped. If you know something, we know where we'll find you. For you. Out! Professor Paredes has a memory gap. Whenever he gets into his senses, he always says your name. Take me to him. [in Taglish] It's better if you attend our batch's grand reunion next year. Uh… [in Tagalog] A lot of people texted me. [police siren blaring] [in English] Men, get him! -[Lilia] Michael! -[in Tagalog] Chief, wait! -[Michael] What's my offense? -What's this about? Stop this! Release him! What do you want? [in Taglish] Ma'am, are you okay? We have a kidnap alert. We're here to rescue you. They said you're missing. I wasn't kidnapped! No one got kidnapped! -Sorry, ma'am. -[in Tagalog] Go ahead. Are you okay, Mike? Damn. I thought it was another Martial Law. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] We thought something bad had happened to you. [in Taglish] Actually, both my phones ran out of battery. I told you to always charge the other phone for emergencies. I forgot because I was so busy. [in Tagalog] So, you and Michael met. I thought he had no plans of coming back to the Philippines. I was also surprised. He had business that he needed to attend to here. [in Taglish] Sell him a condo unit. Tell him it's nice to retire here in the Philippines. [in Tagalog] I know he has no plans of staying here. [in Taglish] Tell him we should have a get-together. Give me his cell phone number. I want to say sorry. Why are you sorry? What's important is you weren't kidnapped. [somber music playing] [in Tagalog] ♪ Rise from slumber ♪ ♪ Rise from slavery ♪ ♪ Rise from… ♪ [in Taglish] These are the letters I sent him in year 1982. [in Tagalog] To ask him where you are. [somber music playing] He wasn't able to open it. [Michael in English] Please, sir, try to locate Lilia Chong for me. And tell her… [Lilia in Tagalog] This makes me regret more of what happened to Michael and me. Ge Ha Lao Lang seems to have a memory gap now. The old man in the moon. He forgot to write our names in his book. If we didn't see each other in Thailand, you'd never come back here, right? [in English] I took it as a sign. [in Tagalog] There's a reason we bumped into each other. [in English] After all these years. [in Tagalog] We're done here, Mike. Lilia, we never wanted those things to happen. We can erase all of it. And pick up where we left off. Paul is nice to me. [in Taglish] He's nice because he's guilty. -[in Tagalog] Don't say that. -Why not? He pushed you away from me. [in Hokkien] [in English] That's the point. [in Hokkien] [in Taglish] We still have a chance. [in Tagalog] While we still can. That's not easy. We have children. They're old enough. You fight for other people, why don't you do it to yourself? [in Taglish] And just waste 25 years of marriage with Paul? [in Tagalog] Mike, you're ruining our family. He did it first. He deceived you. He's not the one you want. [in Taglish] In Chinese culture's arranged marriage, many people get married to a person they don't want. We were fighting against it. The guy your Papa wanted you to marry, and the woman my parents wanted for me. And now, you still ended up with a person you didn't want to be with. Let's stop this. [Lilia groaning] [gentle music playing] [moans] [sighs] Let's not do that anymore. [in English] Sorry. [in Tagalog] I went with you here because of another reason. I want to tell you something. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] There was no other man? [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] But I saw her before we got married. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] What if she ended up with somebody else even if you love her? What would you do? [in Hokkien] [somber music playing] [Chinese folk music playing] [people clapping, cheering] [Chinese folk music playing] [applause] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [all applauding] [in Taglish] The package of benefits of Philam Life Insurance given to the employees is good. That's what she does with her employees in our real estate company. So… your relationship is good. Whose relationship? Our relationship with our employees is good. [in Tagalog] Because we understand their situation. What I learned from the movement is… [in English] honesty. [in Tagalog] You shouldn't betray your comrades. Only enemies are the ones you should betray. Right? I'm glad we're all still here. We've come to this point. [in Taglish] The trouble we had during the '70s and '80s… [in Tagalog] we're lucky we're still here today, right? It still gives me fright until now. Especially when we were chased by the military. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here now. If I didn't do that, maybe my life would be much happier. How about you, Paul? Do you have unfinished business? None. I'm contented. I could never ask for anything else. -How about you? -I have. What is it? What's good is we're still here together as friends, right? [Lilia in English] Let's drink to that. [somber music playing] [glasses clink] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Paul, this doesn't look good. Many people have seen them together. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] You're the one we're worried about here. Michael was a good friend of ours. [in Hokkien] [in Taglish] And you put his name on your Silver Wedding anniversary guest list. [in Tagalog] We owe him our life. You were still young then. You don't know anything. You owe him your life? That's why it's okay for you, whatever they're doing? They're not doing anything wrong. We don't know that. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Be angry at them, not us. [in English] Please, Ma. [in Tagalog] Don't meddle. This is my and my wife's life. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] They are our friends. [in Taglish] They just said that because they're concerned. [in Tagalog] Did you hear what they said? It's good that you heard it directly from them, rather than from somebody else. My Mom is not a bad person. We know that but they just said it because they heard it somewhere else. Mama loves Papa. That's enough. Let's go back to the court. They're waiting for you. [in Hokkien] Eliza… [car door thuds] -Hey. -Ma. What do you like? No. I'm good. Why didn't we meet at home or at the showroom? [in English] How urgent is this? [in Taglish] Before anything else, do you remember the capital you needed for your sports spa? -[in Tagalog] Ma, I don't need it anymore. -You already borrowed capital? Yes, I asked Papa. He let me borrow money. Why did you do that? Ma, what's wrong with that? Who else will I go to? He was surprised because he said I never asked him for anything. Because if your Papa will give you his business, [in Taglish] I want you to be deserving. [in Tagalog] But I am. I'm the only son… Is he the one people are gossiping about? What do you mean? Stephen… Michael, Stephen… [soft music playing] Stephen, this is Michael. Stephen. Stephen! -[car door thuds] -[engine starts] [Stephen] Ma, I'm the one embarrassed. -He acts like he's young. It's shameful. -I have nothing to be ashamed of. Ma, are you out of your mind? Stephen, Michael and I are not doing anything wrong. I don't care. It doesn't look right. You always spend time with him than Papa. That's not true. They just made it up. Who is that guy to you? [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] He's volunteering to help you for your business plan. Ma, I don't understand you. You don't want me to borrow from Papa and now, you want to borrow from this guy? Isn't that being arrogant? He isn't like that, Stephen. Even if he's a friend of you and Papa's, we still think he's being arrogant. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] He's thick-faced! Don't call him that! Why? Because you're falling for him? Because you plan to be together? Because you're both going crazy? [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Because he is your father. Stephen… [Young Paul] No one will know. We won't tell them you're pregnant. They won't notice it. Paul, Mike needs to know this. Do you have any contact with him? Forget about him. He has forgotten about you. [singing in Mandarin] [in English] Okay, break, everybody! [in Tagalog] I still can't believe it. I'm not Papa's real son. Do you think what Mama said was true? I don't think matters like this is considered a joke. Do you think Papa knows? I don't know. I don't want to know. I'm confused. That's why Mama doesn't want you to borrow money from Papa. Mama's ashamed. But I can't remember any chance that he treated me otherwise. He has always treated us equally. But I pity Mama. [in Taglish] All these years, she's been holding this secret. [in Tagalog] I don't know. What will happen to me now? [in Taglish] Don't worry. You'll always be our brother. [in Tagalog] Nothing will change that. [light music playing] [in Hokkien] [utensils clink] [somber music playing] [utensils clink] [in Tagalog] Are you leaving too, Judith? Do you understand why they did that? I understand you better, Ma. I'm used to people leaving me behind. Do you know that that's the story of my life? I can never do that to you, Ma. No matter what they say about you. You're still the one I'm going to believe in. [somber music playing] -[Bernadette] What's the status? -[Judith] Everything's in order. [in Taglish] The florist is already waiting for the down payment. The renewal of vows will be held at the San Agustin Church. Paul said it's all settled there and then the wedding reception… [Eliza scoffs] Is that Silver wedding anniversary still on? [in Tagalog] Can we just ignore the gossip? Can we really ignore it? It might not push through. It won't push through if we're making a big deal out of it. [in Taglish] Judith, the Chinese community have been talking about them. The guests might be chuckling on the side while they're doing their vows. [Eliza] So they should just celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary instead. [in Tagalog] They're old by then. I don't think either of them will cheat by then. Did we see anything? [in Taglish] Judith, it's obvious, right? [in Tagalog] They're just out together and Papa knows about it. Your Papa is a very good person. Are we here to gossip about them? Because if that's the case, I'm out. What you're doing to Mama reflects who we are. Think about that. [in Taglish] Is there an occasion? [in Tagalog] It's better for us to talk to you here than at the house. To avoid problems. Are you here to scold me? To warn you. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] You're taking advantage of my brother's kindness. It's better if you break up with Paul. No. [in Chinese accent] She should break up with her lover. Ma, but she's the problem. I don't want them to ruin the family. I've been kind to you. We've all been kind to you. Then this is how you're going to treat us? [Bernadette] How dare you! -Who do you really love? -Both of them. [Bernadette gasps] You really are crazy. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] You can't love two men. I love them both. [in Taglish] Before Mike even became my boyfriend, and Paul became my husband, we were all together. [in Tagalog] That's why I love them both. Is that difficult to understand? She should be talking to a psychiatrist. You can't love two men. Only one. There is no law stating that loving two men is not allowed. -That's bigamy. -That's only about marriage, Bernadette. [in Hokkien] [in Taglish] I will give you five minutes to get out of my office. [in Tagalog] When I come back and you're still here… [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Does your family need to gang up on me? [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] I have nothing to do with it! If they want respect, they should respect me, too! -You need to respect them. -Do you even respect me? I married you even if Mama doesn't like you! -I accepted your child! -Did you even respect me? Do you want to be with Michael? -Now, it's my fault? -You know where to find him! I did it because I love you! That's a lie! If he really loves you, he shouldn't have left you. He could've faced danger here with you! You played nice to me so he will turn out to be the villain. That's it, Paul! What's really your point, Lilia? Do you want to be with him? Yes, I deceived you. I deceived you! But that's my way to get you. I thought we'd be happy. Enough for you to forget about him. [grunts] [somber music] -It's fine with me if you're leaving. -[maid] Sir, ma'am. You're going to be fitted now. -Good evening, ma'am… -Good evening, ma'am, sir. I'll be fitting you for your 25th wedding anniversary. Ma'am, by the way, I'm Jilan. Ma'am, are you okay with the design we talked about? [in English] Excuse me. [somber music playing] [in Tagalog] Your fever is high. Get some rest. What are you doing? Why are you getting weak? Eliza… Are you and Papa separating? Why do you ask me that? Are we still important to you? Of course. Then what's happening? Don't listen to anyone else. I'm confused. I'm ashamed. Are you doubting me? Eliza… What kind of person do you think I am? [somber music playing] [door thuds] [sighs] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] I feel bad whenever I see you like that. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] You're concerned about Michael? When you ran away… He brought me back here. That's why you… you should go back to your house. Go back to Paul. After all that has happened, I don't think it's possible anymore. My children don't want me anymore. -[Lilia sobbing] -[sighs] I don't know what to say to you. But I know, if you want, you can come home here. [in Hokkien] [Lilia in Tagalog] I cannot deny that I still love Michael. How can you forget your first love, whom you wished to be your husband and be the father of your firstborn? That moment, I asked for a sign. One thing that will make me decide to leave Paul and be with Michael. We didn't tell you who your real father is. So you won't feel any different from your siblings. Pa… [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Now, you know. I think you should get to know Michael more. I could never replace you with anyone else. He is still your real father, Stephen. Michael has been a big part of our lives. You can be proud of him. [somber music playing] Paul is setting you free. -We can finally be together. -I'm not sure if this is right. We have the chance to make up for that mistake. [in Taglish] I can't say anything bad about the 25 years that Paul and I were together. Those years should've been mine. -[in English] Mike, I need more time. -[in Tagalog] There's no time. [in Taglish] In three days from now, I will leave. [in Tagalog] I have a business to attend to. [in Taglish] One year, two years, when you come back. -By that time-- -[in Tagalog] I'm not coming back. If you don't come with me, we're done. [in Hokkien] [somber music playing] [in Tagalog] You will watch Judith's play the day after tomorrow, right? If you will be there. [in Taglish] I will decide from there. [somber music playing] Sir, this is the barong you had made for the silver wedding anniversary. [in Tagalog] You can leave it there. [in English] Thank you. [in Taglish] Sir, is it your order to hold the printing of the invitations? [in English] Yes. Until further notice. [in Taglish] Okay. Thank you. [somber music playing] [Chinese folk music playing] [music continues playing] [audience applauding] [light music playing] [singing in Mandarin] [sighs] [singing in Mandarin] [Lilia in Taglish] I decided to look for the sign here. I decided that after Judith's song, I will turn to look for Michael's seat and if it's empty, that is the sign that I will not go with him. [crowd applauding] [indistinct chatter] -[crowd applauding] -[indistinct chatter] [in Hokkien] [in English] You're very good. -Congratulations. -Thank you. -Take care. -Bye. Thank you. Bye! [indistinct chatter] Let's go. Bye, Bernadette. Take care! Bye. [chuckles] [engine revs] -Bye. -[Lilia] Bye. [indistinct chatter] [somber music playing] [in Tagalog] Lilia, let's go. Lilia, let's go. [in Hokkien] [somber music playing] [somber music playing] [sobbing] [sobbing continues] [sniffles] [in English] Are you okay? [in Taglish] Sorry for what happened the other day. Sorry for everything I did. I did it only because I love you so much. [sobbing] [sobbing continues] [suspenseful music playing] -[gunshot] -[Paul grunts] -[gunshot] -[driver grunts] [somber music playing] [engine revs] Paul, no! No, Paul! No, Paul! Help! [sobbing] No! Help! Help! Help us! Please! Help! [crying] [sobbing] Help us! Please! Help! Help! [siren blaring] I won't leave you. I will stay by your side. Paul… You must be praying for Paul's life to end. That's what you wanted, right? So that you and Michael will finally be together. If Paul dies, I will never forgive you. [somber music playing] [somber music playing] [somber music continues] [sobbing] [Michael] Paul… [machine beeping] Paul, I haven't told you that I'm grateful for you. Thank you for taking care of Stephen. Thank you for understanding. Where's Lilia? She's outside. -Do you want me to-- -Michael… I will give her back to you. [somber music playing] [Lilia in Tagalog] Before Paul died, he asked Bernadette and his mother to love me like how they loved him. It took a while for them to understand it. Whenever I close my eyes now, I can only see those times Paul and I are together. Many memories were made in 25 years. [somber music playing] [somber music continues playing] [somber music continues playing] [sobbing] [somber music playing] Come. [somber music playing] [Lilia] Michael stayed longer days after Paul's burial. Maybe because of Paul's advice. Stephen was able to accept that Michael is his father. But I can still feel the resentment of the whole clan. [both sob] [somber music playing] [Michael] Paul told me… that he will give you back to me. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] It really won't. How will you go about your life now? You can leave now. They're still angry at you. I can survive on my own. [in Taglish] I don't expect us to be together now. [in Tagalog] Give me a chance. I have decided, Mike. Since that night Paul was shot. When I got in the car with him, that was it for us. Why did you decide on that? I got the answer from you. Do you remember when I ran away before? You brought me back home to Papa. [sobbing] Papa reminded me. You told me before, to go back to my family. I will come back here every year. [in English] Next year… [in Tagalog] I will bring Stephen to America. To be honest, Lilia… we're now a family, too. You know, Mike? If I ran away with you that night… you could have died. Because I was the one they're chasing. But in reality, Paul actually saved you. You were saved by my decision to stay with him. It seems like… It seems like I will spend the rest of my life alone. [sobbing] [in Hokkien] [somber music playing] [Lilia in Tagalog] I loved them both. And the important thing is… they both loved me, too. [reporter] Mr. Paul Yang's murderer has been arrested. [in English] What's your plan? [Lilia] I'm going back to anti-crime advocacy. [in Taglish] Is there a chance of peace and order in our country? [in Tagalog] Why not? While crimes are spreading, we should be more committed to fighting them. [in English] You mean you haven't given up on the Philippines? Why should I? It's my only country. [presenter] Mrs. Lilia Chong Yang. Most Outstanding Woman of the Year in the field of public service. [crowd applauding] [Lilia] Thank you. [in Tagalog] I dedicate this award in memory of my husband Paul Yang. [applause] To my children… [in English] I miss you all. Paul, wherever you are… this is for you. Thank you. [uplifting music] [uplifting music continues] [Lilia] Thank you. Pa… [uplifting music continues] [inaudible] [uplifting music continues] Sis. [in Tagalog] Forgive me. [Bernadette] Come home. [Lilia sobs] [applause continues] [uplifting instrumental music] [crowd cheering] [firecrackers exploding] [uplifting instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] [firecrackers exploding] [uplifting instrumental music fades] ["Pagbigyan Ang Puso" by Karylle and Jerome John Hughes playing] ♪ Ever since we parted ways ♪ ♪ Our promises faded away as well ♪ ♪ I tried to leave and forget everything ♪ ♪ As I cannot do anything about it ♪ ♪ No matter how far you are from me ♪ ♪ You're the one I still long for ♪ ♪ No one else ♪ ♪ And even if I knew ♪ [both] ♪ You're with someone else ♪ ♪ My heart still longs for you ♪ ♪ And I keep coming back to you ♪ ♪ I hope you still feel that I love you ♪ ♪ I hope you believe That you will never be alone ♪ ♪ I pray for my only wish ♪ ♪ For you to embrace me once again ♪ ♪ I hope you give my heart a chance ♪ ♪ It might be hard to go back ♪ [both] ♪ To the love we've had before ♪ ♪ Yet if there's still a bit of it Left in you ♪ ♪ The love I had in your heart ♪ ♪ I will now go back to you ♪ ♪ I hope you still feel that I love you ♪ ♪ I hope you believe That you will never be alone ♪ ♪ I pray for my only wish ♪ ♪ For you to embrace me once again ♪ ♪ I hope you give my heart a chance ♪ ♪ I hope you still feel that I love you ♪ ♪ I hope you believe That you will never be alone ♪ ♪ I pray for my only wish ♪ ♪ For you to embrace me once again ♪ ♪ I hope you give my heart a chance ♪ ♪ I hope you give my heart a chance ♪ [music fades]
