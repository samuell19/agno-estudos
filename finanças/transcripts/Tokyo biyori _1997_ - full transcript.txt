Remember how to get here? Yep. You do remember... Yeah. Right. I'II be waiting. OK, thanks. Choro... I stiII feeI Iike Yoko is hee with me now... ""TOKYO BIYORI"" You can't escape! He goes on and on, and I'm not someone who can say, ''shut up!'' He's Iike that. He says he's so Iucky...as if he wanted to convince himseIf. He tires you out! And when he's down, it's us who worry. That's right. He's not bad at heart. You're sure about that? But Mizutani gets it worst. Damn right! He's aIways sIapping me on the back... ...and saying ''go for it!'' ''Go for it!'' Like that? And you can't just teII him ''hands off!'' Some guys just aren't cut out to work in advertising... Good oId Houjima... I wish I couId say that! I'd quit in a second if I couId. Oh, sure! How did you two get aIong? Me and him? You started together... That's about aII, though. Better get things off your chest now... Right! I'm him. ''Go for it!'' Piss off, wiII you?! Whoa! Looks Iike I'm getting a IittIe drunk here... You're hopeIess! What's going on? Come outside. Why are you dicing that stuff? WeII? Am I red? Hm... You are. No, I'm not. You are. I'm not! I'm red. You just ate too much! No one cares?! Sure they do! Anyone wouId! I've been caIIing her ''Taniguchi'' aII day! She knows it's just a mistake. You couId have stopped me and said her name was ''Mizutani''! You shouId have toId me! Then I couId've just said, ''Oh, sorry''... Oh, what's the man's name?! Who? The man who toId me! Hirata... I'm sure my caIIing her ''Taniguchi'' bothered him. You heard how he corrected me! If that bothers you, how can you meet anyone?! Even I forget some names if I meet five or six peopIe. PeopIe make mistakes! Why are you so worked up?! Nobody cares, I teII you. No one gives a damn! CIean this up. Sorry. Don't worry. Come again soon. - You taking the train? - That's fastest. Yeah...good night. See you. Thank you. Come again. Hey! Yoko didn"t come back fo thee days. Those wee the wost days we eve had. Why is it it"s those times I emembe most? Union TaveI Hit by a dump truck? Me? From her voice on the phone I was convinced it was true. I was thinking of things we couId do to heIp. Has she caIIed since then? No... Thank you. Has Mrs Shimazu caIIed back? No. This is her husband. I'm Miyamoto. How do you do. She has the next desk. She mentions you. No, he wasn't in an accident. I'm sorry. Thank you. That'II be aII. Three days? That's serious... Um... Yes? WouId you mind not teIIing my wife that I was here? If that's possibIe... What? ""Not Hee"" What the...? Yoko... Aren't you hot? Summer's coming, you know. Here's your drink, Tetsuo. Who's this? He Iives on the first fIoor. Both his parents work. He caIIs me ''Granny''. ''Granny''? That's right. Why? Hm, I wonder... He doesn't taIk... He's nervous. There's a scary oId man here. Get me a drink, too! OK, OK, Granny'II get you a drink, too. What coIor's this? What's this? He's hopeIess! You're right. He Iacks sociaI skiIIs. It'd be different if he had a brother or sister. Aren't there kids his age in the neighborhood? I think there are... Why doesn't he make friends with them? Why not? I'm not Tetsuo. Don't confuse me with him. WeII... ...it makes you wonder... It does... I see! You want me to anaIyze Tetsuo, do you? Why doesn't Tetsuo have any friends his own age... You don't have to do that. But I think it's Iike you say. He Iacks sociaI skiIIs. Both his parents work, and on top of that... What do you want to see? The news? I'II bring you the paper. No, thanks. More rice. More rice!! I'm sorry. Where were you... ...for three days? Union TraveI... Si, cIaro, como uno, Agencia viajes union, digame. En que puedo servirIe? Miyamoto, about this... Come here!

I get nervous! It's a smaII company! Yes, sir. Not this! So is everything aII right? Oh, it wasn't as bad as we thought. What wasn't? My husband... Uh, oh, yes, your husband. I'm gIad to hear that. He gets out next week. Shimazu... This is it. We'II advertise the Spanish restaurant here. Pictures of food? WeII, that's the main thing... Not that your husband needs the money... ...but we wiII need a picture. I'II ask him. WouId you? I'II push for him. Every IittIe extra bit heIps. Anyway, it's a good thing he wasn't badIy hurt. Good-bye. Wait! Don't stand so cIose. It's a smaII company. Advertising work? I guess so. Do you have the pamphIet? Not here. How can I see what they want without a sampIe? That's right! Yeah! What's this? What? This. Oh, that's Tetsuo's. It's a girI's toy. He Iikes girIs' toys. I'II teII them you're not interested in the pamphIet. They're disorganized. There's no one to say how to do it. I don't mean a company shouId grow for growth's sake... ...but you shouId do things right. You agree, don't you? You shouId do things right! ''AII wiII be forgiven''... that's their attitude! They're nice peopIe, but... ''AII wiII be forgiven''... ain't it the truth! Know what I mean? You agree, don't you. I'm going to teII them what I think! Hey! The stir-fry! Uh-oh...who's going to forgive me for this? What? A mosquito. Yeah? I can hear it buzzing... So it's that time of year aIready... Yoko... What? Let's go to Yanagawa. Yanagawa? Yanagawa... Our anniversary's JuIy 7th. It'II be Iike our honeymoon. What do you think? That takes me back... Doesn't it! It's back! What? Where's Granny? She's not here. There's no ''Granny'' here. There is so! Hey, you, wake up! That guy just took your picture! With that camera! HoId it right there! What are you doing? Catch him! My stuff! Catch him! Hurry! PoIice Station Why did you want his picture for? Not just today. I've seen him doing it before. Many times! Say something, wiII you? WeII, I don't... WiII you give him the fiIm? WeII? I don't want the fiIm. I'd just Iike to know why he was taking my picture. He was making fun of peopIe who work for a Iiving! He just wants to take pictures of peopIe's faces? Nonsense! PeopIe he doesn't even know! What do you do for a Iiving? What do I do? WiII you Iisten to the nerve of this man! ""To Be O Not To Be"" This oId bitch beside him! ''Hey!'' she says. ''That guy just took your picture!'' Can you beIieve it?! Sticking her nose in! Loud-mouthed oId busybody! Why do peopIe Iike that exist? I'd Iove to dissect her brain! If it wasn't a crime, I'd've murdered her! ''To be or not to be''... Perfect words for that oId cow! It Iooks interesting. Let's go see it, now that you're friends. Friends? Are my words reaching you? - More rice? - More rice? Yes. Let's have some more rice. What shouId I teII them about the pamphIet? Oh, that... He asked again. Does it have to be me? No. He's pretty smug, isn't he. My boss? Did you meet him? When? Forget it. Hey, rice...rice... ActuaIIy, your husband asked us to keep it secret from you. It was hard to do. In effect, we ended up Iying to you. Anyway, I understand about the pamphIet. Excuse me. You'd think we were the ones in the wrong! Why'd he say no? I don't know. He's not working, is he? Don't ask me! Living off his wife! That's awfuI! Why did she have to teII such a transparent Iie? What are you thinking? I'm not thinking. No! But Granny bought these just for you! I'm a boy! You obey your parents. Why won't you obey Granny? Don't Iook at me Iike that. It makes me sad. Come on, be a good boy, Iike you aIways are. PIease! Those are girIs' cIothes! A boy in girIs' cIothes is weird! Why is it weird? Do it for Granny. I don't think it's weird. Just for a IittIe whiIe. Who'II think it's weird? There's onIy the two of us here. I see. You hate me, don't you. Say you hate me! If you hate me, say so! Go away. Go away! So he's the star... Let's Iine up. What number do you have? 60. Here...excuse me. Know her? Are you Mr Shimazu? And you're Yoko... CouId you sign a copy of your book for me? Thanks. Thank you. CouId I shake your hand? Thank you. The theater is opening now. PIease move forward in Iine. No bugs in there. You stiII hear it? No, not now. Oh... What? Where are you going? I'm just waIking around. You know something? What? You're too nice to me. What do you mean? What do you mean, I'm too nice? Stop Iooking at me so much. I'm just waIking. I'm OK. I can waIk. Yoko... What? I won't Iook at you so much. Hey! Are you OK? Over here! Wait for me! You're sIow! I'm out of breath! A maiIman! - HeIIo. - HeIIo. A house way out here... Is there anyone home? Looks Iike they're out. That maiIman brought these. Don't touch those! Their name's ''Yokoyama''. Who's it from? ''Don't touch those,'' you said! Now I'm curious. It's from down in Kyushu. The same name. ReIatives, I guess. These are from the tax office... This is insurance... Better put them back. Put them back the same way. The maiIman might put them in the box a certain way. The Yokoyamas might reaIize that they've been taken out. Uh-oh... The maiIman's habit... What might that be? Maybe he knows. Hey, how does the maiIman put these in here? He's shy. No. It's raining. It is! Wow! He's smart! Come on! What is it? Look! A piano. Yeah! Let's go...watch your step. You OK? It's a rock! That's even better! Let's pIay a tune! ''Onarido''... ''A road restricted to persons of high rank... ''...this road ran east from the Outer Moat of Edo CastIe... ''...and angIed north towards Ueno.'' ''March 1976, Chiyoda Ward.'' Mr Shimazu... Mizutani! What brings you here? So what happens now? Look who's taIking! I'm changing careers. To what? PubIishing, I think. It sticks to you, doesn't it. Oh, don't worry about me. No, I meant the air. The air? Yeah, it is humid. Is there someone named Mizutani here? Yes! You have a phone caII. Maybe I have a job aIready. Thank you very much. - After you. - Excuse me. HeIIo, Mizutani speaking. HeIIo... Granny! Granny's here! Granny! We shouId be going home. I want to pIay with Granny! You've pIayed a Iot... I want to pIay with Granny! What do you mean? I'm your granny. Excuse him. You're Tetsuo's grandmother? I came down from Sendai... Granny, Iet's pIay! Come on, now, Iet go... Excuse me. You have to get out, Mr Shimazu! I'II bring him again. He Iooks serious. No, not reaIIy. Oh, and cooI... But your wife doesn't Iook bizarre in your book... She hasn't been weII IateIy. What book? He pubIished a great book of portraits of his wife. His wife? I'm crushed! That's right. Mr Shimazu Ioves his wife. What's wrong with that? He is cooI! It's not wrong. It's just rare. Their wives aren't so important to most men I know. Maybe they just show it differentIy. Is that true? I treat my wife rough. What kind of rough? Not the kind of rough that you're thinking. I haven't said a word! No whips or anything... Mr Awano! Oh, Mama! I Iove you! Hey... Sorry...I'm out of it tonight. Don't mind me... Don't worry, Mr Shimazu. An artist foIIows his own path. There's no need to care what other peopIe think. When he's in the mood he's hiIarious. Yeah, when I have fun I have fun. Tonight, I don't know... My diary wiII record that tonight I was the wet bIanket. Now he's starting! Mama, I want to sing! Sumi, the guitar! Yes, ma'am! It's Mr Awano we want to sing, not you! Sorry. Huh? What? I'm going to bed. Did you sit up waiting for me? No. Time to sIeep. I drank with some magazine peopIe. They Iiked the book. Yoko...Iet's go to Yanagawa. I'm going to take a shower. Fukuda Ea, Nose & Thoat CIinic ''Myodesopsia''? What's that? You hear a mosquito, but there isn't one there. No? It's Iike ringing in the ears. Sometimes she sees mosquitoes, so she hears them as weII. So she needs an eye doctor? Yes...but as far as I can see... Excuse me, Doctor... Coming. As far as you can see...what? Don't worry. See how it goes. If it goes on I know an good eye doctor. And her ears? They're fine. Your wife... it is your wife, isn't it? Yes...why do say that? She's so young... No, why do you say her ears are fine? There's no injury. It'II go away. Just go on as you aIways do. I saw Yoko waIking aIone in the steet. I hadn"t seen he by heseIf since we wee maied. ReaIizing the obvious.: that she couId Iive without me... ...made my heat bun in my chest. Isn't it heavy reading? But somehow a book Iike this stays with you... WouId you Iike this? I just feIt Iike buying it. You don't mind? Thank you very much. WeII, see you. Is that a camera? This? Yes. A camera. Is that a book? Yes, it's a book. ""Fate"" Something wrong? No... HoId on here... Not too dark? No, I'm fine. Good afternoon. Why the sudden phone caII? WeII, you know... What are you reading? A book. What book? '' Fate, by Kunikida Doppo.'' WeII, you know... Anything happen today? You mean at work? Or not at work... Why? Isn't that what you taIk about in a pIace Iike this? Isn't it? I see... Work... Or on the way there... It'II be fun. What wiII? Yanagawa. WiII JuIy 7th ever come? Sure it wiII, someday. JuIy 7th? Yes, I guess it wiII. Before you know it, it'II be JuIy 8th, then 9th... That's awfuI! Yoko... What? I can't move! Don't Iook at me! Hmph! It's foIIowing us. Take that! It wants to speak. It's not a stranger any more. It's waiting for us. Piss off! ''Don't Ieave me here, buddy!'' Hey, you're a man... You've abandoned him! I know it's hard, but seek happiness eIsewhere... ...Mr M.T. Can... Don't cry. It was for our sake. I pray for the happiness of M.T. Can. Yes. We must. ""Heat up you beakfast"" What's wrong? SchooI's that way. Tetsuo... Granny! Mr Shimazu... How have you been? Where's my wife? Uh, she hasn't come in today. Did she take the day off? Yes... Why? I thought you might know. WeII, you can't ask a fish to swim on dry Iand, I guess. And knowing that, and stiII having to ask it to swim... ...is hard, too. I see. Ms Miyamoto tried her best, too... ...but, you know... the sea and the Iand... Of course, we shouId hear what your wife has to say... She certainIy tried her best. I admit that. When someone can't even manage a ''good morning''... Oh, don't be Iike that! No... I understand... Won't it be a probIem if she Ieaves right away? We'II be fine. I can do both jobs. Yeah? Yes, anytime. CouId you put it off a few days? How Iong? WeII... She's asked for JuIy 6th, 7th and 8th off, hasn't she. How about making that the end? Good idea... Yes... You're right on the baII. You are! Let's do that. Where couId he be? And it's getting Iate... He wasn't there! He wasn't in schooI today. - How do you know? - My son's in his cIass. What's happened? The Sawamura boy's disappeared. Sawamura? On the first fIoor. Tetsuo. You know him... Maybe we shouId caII the poIice... Yes, Iet's! ""Tukish Mach"" No! Look at this! It's the same. You can't take 7 away from 5, so you carry the 10. That gives you 15. So how much is 15 minus 7? 15 minus 7... 15 minus 7. Eight? Right! So this is 8... There's a mosquito... fIying just around me... Granny, I want to go. Granny! Go where? Home. Where do you Iive? I put these cIothes on Iike you wanted. Let's go home. They'II Iaugh at you if you come home Iike that. A boy in girI's cIothes... They'II aII Iaugh. Do you want that? When they Iaugh, you'II cry, Iike you did this morning. You'II cry and you'II say you onIy did because I made you. If you'II just cry and be ashamed when you get there... ...why do you say you want to go home? You won't cry when everyone sees you? Liar! Why do you Iie Iike that? Look, you're crying now! You hate wearing these cIothes, don't you. You hate it so much you don't want to be seen! So why did you teII me you'd wear Granny's cIothes? Don't cry! TeII me! Coward! If you hate them, take them off. Take them off and teII me you hated me from the start! Yoko... No! Go away! Go away! Ow! Ow! That hurts! Yoko... Hurt me... TeII me you hate me! It's OK now. They're rebuiIding across the way. I'II run the bath. Fukuoka Station What's wrong? What is it? I don't want to go. I don't want to go to Yanagawa. We're aImost there! It's hot. It sure is. You're sweating... Where's my handkerchief? Here... We made it... ShaII we go? Let's go! Hot, ain't it. You were here eight years ago on your honeymoon? It's changed since then.

The two of you... I'II send your bags. Thank you. Yoko, come here... It's broad dayIight! Look! That knight's stiII here! So he is! Do you think he's angry? Why? We abandoned M.T. Can! M.T. Can? Oh, him! Yes! About that! Why wouId he be angry? What if that was his son or something. This guy Iooks Iike he's pining for a son far away... That's so sad! A picture! We're very sorry. He moved! No!

That one... She was taking a nap. I onIy ever met her the once. Yeah, you ended up not meeting the day you gave us Choro. That's right. I remember...she kept caIIing you ''Taniguchi''. I hate to remember that. If Hirata hadn't corrected her... ''Taniguchi'' was fine with me. Yoko... What? How's your ear? My ear? You went to the cIinic... What did they say? It's fine. Everyone says how weII we get aIong. Maybe they're right. But... But what? Why do we hide things we shouId be taIking about? Because it's important? What is? Yoko... What? Are you happy? Yoko... What? Are you happy being with me? Don't ask me that... I'II start crying. We got back yesterday. I tried to caII you... Sorry. I haven't seen Yoko for ages. She'II be gIad. She Ioves cats.
