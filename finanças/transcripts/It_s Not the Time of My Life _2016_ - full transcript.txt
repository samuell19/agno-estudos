N?ndi, Pet?: Not a day goes by without us thinking about you. (Ernella At Farkas') IT'S NOT THE TIME OF MY LIFE He had stomach pains every hour lasting 20 minutes. He screamed as if he was being skinned alive. We didn't know what to do. We took him to emergency at midnight. They drew blood, did an ultrasound, and everything was normal. The doctor had no idea. He examined his butt. Did you open the window on purpose? I'm freezing. I'm airing the room. Can't you see he's sweating? He'll get pneumonia. - Close it then. - "Aired" enough? Close it. I read a study that said when you turn 40 you become... your brain begins to lose plasticity. Time for bed. So you should start studying languages. Once he gets wound up, there's no getting him to bed. So did they find a cause? Nothing. We brought him back to the emergency room. I'm playing piano. They examined him again and said he had no infections. I went back to playing, and it all returned. Better than when I was 18. Do you know The Well-Tempered Clavier? I used to play... Did you know that? Awesome music. I'll play for you. It's like meditating. When I start playing I disconnect from everything. - Quieter please! - I'm being quiet! Let me play a little. It just went on, hour after hour, 20 long minutes... Are you looking for something? Imola! Imola! Are you alright? No... I don't need... No. No! Bruno, quiet down now. Why do we always wait until he gets on our nerves? - Why tell me that? - I'm not telling you, just saying... Are you sure you won't stay? No, it's time for bed. Don't worry, you can sleep in the guest room. OK, OK. Easy there. - Kisses! - Kisses! - It was fun! - See you next time! - See you later. - Take care. Don't laugh at me. Ten more years, and he'll be up until breakfast. Four. Five 00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,486 It won't stop. He'll kill us. He's been screaming for 5 years. No day goes by without it. The moment he opens his eyes, He wants to see a movie. As soon as he's awake, he has to watch a movie, or have someone tell him a story, to entertain him. Because that's how he is? Is that what you're saying? [i]You'll[/i] get worn down, not me. You'll see. When he comes home drunk, puts on the TV... He's already doing it at age 5. Why would he change if you pretend everything is fine? He goes to bed past 11 P.M. Do you really think that's normal? When I was a kid, we had to be in bed by 7 P.M. I?m not saying my childhood was an ideal one, but we knew not to cross a line. Well, what can I say... Do what you want... I don't care. It just gets on my nerves. I can't simply ignore it. It's as if nerves in my head were splintering... Why are we still together? I don't know. As soon as I say anything, you always ask me that. Because you talk to him like that... Screaming from the start... Couldn't you say, "Please, quiet down, I want to talk to Mom?" That's exactly what I said. No, you shouted at him right away, "Don't do it again!" It can't be how you want it. Don't rewrite the story. First I asked nicely. I said: "Bruno, please..." No, you started screaming right away. This is incredible. I should have recorded it. Next time, I will. You should. Are you doing this on purpose? You're saying the opposite of what happened. And he'll remember it your way. Like I was a bad guy yelling at him. He won't remember, he's sleeping. I mean in general. But you'll remember you weren't patient with him. If I say this wall is white, you hear me saying it was black, the opposite. I see now why I always believed my father caused everything. Because my mother changed things just like you're doing now. Yes, that's why he hit her every day. He was powerless. If someone says the opposite of what happened, what can you do? Then, you have to hit them. Because he had no choice. Poor dad. He died totally helpless, and everyone blamed him. What did they forget? Can you go see? No, no. Don't bother. - But I'll take them off... - We never do... - OK then. - I wanted to call, but my cell died. We had to push the car 6 km. Leave it there. We'll get it tomorrow. Where do I put this? In the room, here. Are you sure it's no bother? Of course it isn't. Good night. Look at them, how beautiful! What are they? Guinea pigs. Bring them inside. We were on a very pretty farm. But we had a hard time, and there was no heating inside. We had to wear coats inside the house even. And the Scots ... At first they're very kind, but then the masks come off. Albert didn't get along with them. In the end it was very hard. There were lots of animals. Horses, pigeons and otters. Take off your jacket. Cows, pigs, goats, Guinea fowl, peacocks... Once I even saw, a peacock in the chapel. If you're cold, There's another blanket in the closet. You can set the heater to 5, just don't put anything on top of the radiator, or the thermostat shuts off. Call if you need anything. - Good evening! - Thank you! I'm totally exhausted. Is my pajama out? Yes, I took it out. I don't know. Why didn't they call? I don't know. Ernella said that Albert didn't get along with the people there. I told everyone they wouldn't be back for ten years. I'll ask him: "Albert, dear, do you remember when you said you would not return before ten years?" That's not a good idea. Everything turns to shit almost immediately. Don't rub it it. It's kinder to forget it. I didn't say ten years. I said we'd be back after a year. You did not say that. You said ten years. I'm totally sure. I remember. Don't tell me you remember what I said ten years ago. Ten years, no. One, yes. I know because the day you left I wrote it down in my diary in detail. Don't argue. I don't like hearing you like this. We're not arguing. Just discussing. I'm sure I didn't say that... What a beautiful floor. Pity it's just a rental. How much would it cost to buy? A lot. Why don't you ask for a loan? It'd take 30 years to pay. We'd be paying our entire lives. Plus, we're not sure we want to live here all our lives. But you don't keep anything. All your money goes to the owner. How much do you pay per month? Not much, considering the size, and right in the center of town. How much? Not much. Laura! I don't see myself living my whole life in a rented flat. Don't you miss the garden? Here it is. Wednesday, October 3. Eszter asks: When will you come back? Ernella: Let's try this. We have nothing to lose. If it doesn't work out, we can always return, okay? Albert: I won't set foot in this fucking country for at least ten years. That's for sure. You can't choose where you're born, but you can choose where to die. Me: If we all believed that and left, who would stay? Anyway, you'll be back in a year. Albert: Like hell I will! I say ten years at least! Me: We'll see. I hope I'm wrong. And so on... etc. Are you happy? What? Are you happy? I'm not happy, but that's what he said. What a beautiful cup! Dad gave it to me. Have you talked to him lately? To be honest, no. You should call him sometime. Bring Daddy a beer. - Do you smoke indoors? - Only outside. No matter. It isn't important. We can go outside. No matter. When did you start smoking again? I don't know. It costs so much. But it's been expensive for some time. It's over. I quit. Prices have risen recently. In Scotland too. Good morning! Let me introduce myself! I'm Laura Stern and I'm 10. I swim, play basketball and play the piano. My parents spend much money on me... I didn't see it! See what? Why should you scold her if she didn't see it? There's nothing there. Everything she touches ends up broken. - Not everything. - Where are you going? Nowhere. Stop it! Fix your hair, Laura. Why are you smiling? I'm not smiling. Fix your hair or you'll ruin your eyesight. No slamming. Leave it... Laura! Where are you? I'd like to talk to you. Same Laura. She's tired of so much travel, isn't she? When we went to Portugal with Bruno, He began to stutter. She doesn't stutter at all. I'm not saying she stutters, just... How was it with the Scottish children? Well, she fit in right away. She wrote a 20 page story in English, full of Scottish expressions. Bruno also invents all sorts of stories. He has great imagination. The same as Laura. The same as Bruno. I also got her to play basketball, to do something active - Won't her shoulders get muscular? - It's just as a hobby. Not competitively. That's such nonsense. Competition doesn't hurt. It's rivalry. I don't like rivalry either. Life is rivalry. And competing teaches you things. Like what? How to compete. How strange you always sit there. You sat there last time too. Really? 2. 3. 4 00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,127 From now on, it's your spot when you're here. When you're not, it's mine. I can sit elsewhere... I didn't mean that. Stay there. I'm fine anywhere. So then, tell us. How was it over there? It was really good, no comparison. But what was different? We know you earned more. That's not the point, but the... How can I explain? Mentality? Mentality. That, yes. The mentality. For example, when Laura went to school for the last time, I told the teacher, Mr. Williams, that it was Laura's last day. The teacher went in the classroom and he told the children that... Laura... - It's Laura's last day here. - It's her last day at school. Laura is from Hungary, and will now return. He drew a map of Europe, He pointed out where Hungary was, and they were talking about Hungary all day. Can you imagine some Hungarian teacher doing that? For example, with a Syrian child... Or Montenegrin. And what happens here? At the gas station, Albert asked for a ride to the next one. - What do you think he said? - Sorry, I'm not a taxi. Exactly, Sorry, I'm not a taxi. He got so angry he said we'd walk instead. - But he was right. - It really pisses me off a lot. Because someone is an idiot, it doesn't mean everyone is. There are idiots everywhere. But nine of ten are here, while over there, only one of ten. So here everyone is an idiot except you. I'm going out for a smoke. I don't smoke this early. I'll step out. I'll go for a bit. Mama! Mama! - OK, we can all hear you. - Mama! We already hear you. This isn't a zoo. Where's Mom? She went shopping. Laura! Come play with Bruno. Come on now. Well? Do you remember? Laura has grown up, hasn't she? Come, Laura. Play a little. Draw, or build something. Laura! You can play a lot of things. Bruno! Do you like to play? Do you know what? Teach Laura Lightning McQueen and Doc Hudson. They'll get along just fine. Yes. Would you like some coffee? No thanks. I have my beer. - What happened? - Oh great... What did you do? Bruno, come here. Come on, Bruno. - Where are you going? - He hit me! What's in your hand? - It hurts a lot! - What hurts? I have two holes in my head! Come on, Bruno. Say you're sorry. - Where are the holes? - What did you do? He hit me! - Should I close the door? - Wait a second! What happened? Bruno, come here! - He twisted my hand. - He hit Laura in the head! - Who? Albert? - Yes! Bruno! - Why did you twist him? - She's bleeding from the blow! - So you have to punish him? - Don't shout, the whole world hears. It's for you to hear it! This happens while you're smoking... I can't leave him alone with you for even 2 minutes? It's always me! Never him, always me. When he kills someone, It be my fault too, probably. Don't argue! Everyone is right. We argue because of you. If you didn't fight, this wouldn't happen. That's just what Vekerdy says! You must not create remorse in the child. Let's leave out the theories. Time passes, and they all turn out to be bullshit. I can't believe I can't leave you for even 2 minutes. You could, if he were normal. But if he welcomes her with the leg of a chair... Don't let him get away with it. Who does that come from? Not from me. That's for sure. I wasn't like that, ask my mother. Because you were very closed. Even so, I was not that aggressive. You know? It is like your father and your sister. He's a mixture of his grandpa and Ernella. Hot-tempered, aggressive... How can you talk like that about your own son? I don't lie. I don't sugar coat it. I see it differently. That's horrible! It's very hurtful. It hurts me too. But what do you want me to do? I've felt this since he was born. I didn't cry when his belly hurt. He did it on purpose. What was he doing on purpose? A baby of two months? I can't tell if he cries because something hurts, or if it's on purpose just to annoy others. A two month old baby?! Do you know what you're saying? Yes. Say it then. Say what? Have the courage to say that you don't love him! It's not that... It bothers you. 3. 4. 5 00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:42,124 It's not that I don't love him, but it does bother me. That's a fact. You don't want him... Stop parroting that. You don't want your own son... You'd like that. You're implanting the idea. Sure, that's what I want... If not, why can't you stop repeating it? Because I can't believe it. What? What have you been imagining? You imagine everything. Well, I've had enough. And my bag? I'll be back for my things, or you can keep them too. Mom, you promised that you wouldn't smoke. I don't smoke. Yes, you smoke. I don't smoke. Yes. - You're not taking the bike now. - You'll ride and I'll run beside you? But I want to ride my bike. - The child's room is beautiful! - I saw it. They decorated very well. Birds? I suggested that, and putting the desk under a bunk bed. Laura! There's a piano. Don't you want to try it? I already saw it. It's crappy. Don't talk like that. - Why? You swear. - But it's different for girls. - Why? - Why do you think? It can't be easy heating such a big apartment. Fuck, how many skins do you have? Look at this trunk! - It's from Kalotaszeg. - It's a hundred years old at least. - There's another one there. - It's a luxury. All gifts from her dad. Do you know what they're worth? - About half a million. - Maybe more. Yes, it would be fine to have one in our house. - What house? - What house? Well, what will we have? They've been gone for a while. Aren't you hungry? I'm starving. - Me too. - Me too. Can I draw with this? What is it? Ink for glass. Okay, but not too much. Fuck, this apartment is huge. I'd like to live here. Yes. But you see how it is between them. Big rooms, the trunks, the super fancy children's room... All wasted. I hope I don't live a life like that, all day killing each other. It must be tough on Farkas. Well, two people don't fight unless both want to. At least we love each other. Do you love me? A white shirt would also look good on you. Where is that? In Mexico. Farkas looks so young! I thought he'd never grow old... Yes, he's gone gray. But that doesn't surprise me. It must be hard to live with Bruno. Well, at least you can express your feelings. They were in a hotel. Yes. Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Luxembourg... They've travelled everywhere. You say it as if we've never travelled anywhere. When was the last time we went on a trip? We just got back from Scotland, travelling all over Europe. I wouldn't call that a vacation. Others never leave their village their whole lives. You mean your grandmother? Where have we been in the last five years? - Travel with what? - That's what I'm saying. - Have you asked Eszter? - Not yet. I didn't want to start with that. But relax, I'll ask her. - How much will you ask for? - How much should I ask? A hundred? Fifty? Think they have that much? Don't be silly. Look around. Then ask for two hundred. What about the car? If they take it, I won't have anything. Don't worry, they're not going to... - What's wrong with the car? - Nothing. You should have got started long ago. And how was I going to start? I can barely stand. Why didn't you ask Farkas to get you started? - Sure, of course... - What? I sure he would have taken you. Clearly... And how do I get the deposit? That's why I asked you if you had asked Eszter. I'll ask her. When I get some money, I'll drive a taxi. I don't give a shit. How long will we stay here? Why? We just got here. Don't you like it? Where will we go next? First, let's bring the car back, and then we'll see where we're going. But where are we going to live? Laura! What? I only asked where we're going to live! Let her ask. It concerns her. It concerns me too, but I'm not always asking questions. It would be so great if they didn't come back... They might not come back? Of course they will. I just meant it would be fine if... Why would it be great? Because that way we could stay here. Would you like to live here? No. Why? Because there are no animals here. But you could have your own room. But I miss all the animals so much. And now, what's wrong? I want to go back. I miss the kid so much. When we have a house, we'll have all kinds of animals. Little horses, kids, ducklings... But I want to go back to Scotland. Honey... We can't go back. Why? Laura, it's okay. Please. I hate being here. Everything is much worse here. - Hello. - Hello. Listen, have you seen that envelope? - Which? - The one that was here. - Didn't you take it? - What for? - It's not there? - It isn't. I told you many times to put it in a safe place. Have you eaten? I'll put these back. - Did you find it? - I didn't. - How much was inside? - A lot. - Have you seen an envelope? - What kind? It was on the desk. Have you seen it? A white one. - Have you seen it? - Did you hide it somewhere? I couldn't hide anything. Then I don't know, because nobody else was here. Are you insinuating that we took it? Someone must have taken it. Wait a second. You think we could have taken it? Of course not. I'm just saying that only you were here. - What if Laura...? - What about Laura? This is starting to get... Laura was with us the whole time. And anyway, how can you think we raised her to...? It's not like that. I know that for you, we are nobodies, and you depreciate us because we're not, I don't know, winners like you. - But you shouldn't accuse us. - We don't hate you. - You always speak with superiority... - Who? Me? You and Eszter too, but you don't even notice I never spoke with superiority. I always try to talk to you... - So I can understand, right? - That's paranoid, Ernella. Exactly. You think I'm paranoid, that I have psychological problems. And who knows what else you think. I don't... But you don't know so I had to pass... She doesn't show it. He never does, but I see it every day. You have never had to fight. You're welcome. I did the hard work. Where does that come from? I read that it's always harder for the eldest daughter, and it's true. Because they always forgave you everything, right? They punished me for everything. It's easy to trust people. Do you think I'd have more confidence in myself? If they'd given me a trunk, or a porcelain collection, and more of Dad's things? And who gave you the car? We've been hearing that since... We'll be hearing it the rest of our lives. How many more times will we have to thank him? You don't need to thank him. Just give him a bit of affection, - so he knows you love him. - We love him. Of course we love him. Have you ever told him? We don't speak like that. It isn't necessary to... You didn't call at Christmas! It hurts him. Of course... I was there and I saw it. How do you expect...? I'm not going to call him to give me a trunk. I'm not going to tell him I love him so he pays my rent. I'm not capable of it. - He only helps once in a while. - Sure. And how can you think we call him for that? It's normal to ask your father. It's how things work. When I call, he'll start attacking me, Why have you done this and that? How do you plan to make a living? Why are you leaving the country? Honestly, though. Isn't there some truth to what he says? He can't accept me. He hates Albert. He doesn't hate you... Nothing I do It's good enough. Because you do everything hastily, any which way, always leaving letting whims dictate your actions. Then if something doesn't work, You'll know who to blame. It's true when you're 18, but don't live your whole life like that. You got here here at dawn, unannounced. Don't get me wrong... - Why not say we're a burden? - That's not what I said, but... I thought we could ask a favor If our car had broken down. You can come whenever you want. OK, then we're going. We're going. Don't be silly! We're only saying this because it worries us. Look, you're offended again, instead of being reasonable. No one is going to fix your lives, Ernella. It seems you expect others to solve your problems. But you have to do it yourself. Project your negative feelings towards others. Of course, because my life has changed in a way in which I no longer enjoy anything I do. I am a total failure... I am a zero in a ledger. Of course you aren't. But even so, I'm not a thief. Nobody can say we're not honest. Nobody said that. That's the only thing I inherited from my father. The honor. I didn't inherit money, but in our family there was nothing more important than honor. That's why we are poor. It's not possible to earn money honestly. Search us. I don't have it. Look through our things, if you think we're thieves. I wouldn't steal even if I was forced to. If I find something on the street, I bring it to police. OK, we believe you. Let's try to find out together what happened. We left and the envelope was still here. You stayed, and when we came back, the envelope was gone. I've been here the whole time. You've got fucking nerve! Come on, let's start looking for it. May I look in your room? Maybe you've took it without noticing. I also have mental lapses sometimes. I don't have mental lapses, but go ahead and look. I've never stolen anything in my whole life. It's alright. We talked it out quietly. What have you talked out quietly? Laura, come out, nothing will happen. She was very honest. She admitted and feels very sorry. She feels what? How is it that you feel? Did you take it? Yes. Why did you take it? Why did you take it? Laura, why did you take it? Why are you smiling? I did it for you! Laura! Laura, you deserved it! It wasn't that hard. Come back! I'm so sorry. I don't know... It must be so terribly depressing at that level of human subsistence... The monotony. When they pretended they wanted to leave... God, what a child! Why must we get involved in these kinds of situations? Because she's my sister. If you accept me, then you accept this too. But I chose you. Not your sister. But she's part of me, it doesn't matter how she is. That insipid sentimentality... The slap... They empower each other's self-pity... That Albert... He's like a robot. I tried to explain it to him, that around 40, it's time to start things... - He didn't understand. - Nothing. He must have thought I meant someone else. How long will they stay? Don't tell me you can't endure one day with them! Do you want to start arguing? Do we continue where they started? How many times did we argue today? I'm already sick of it. He's a total idiot. This Albert is not normal. Why is that necessary? What an imbecile! Well, I'm going down. Leave them... - I'll see if I can... - Don't make it worse! Tell him to stop watching TV! And close the door! Terence Hill and Bud Spencer in "Watch Out, We're Mad". Why did you turn it off? Mom will be upset if you watch that. Then read me something! And if I don't? - Berry and Dolly. - Let's see if there's something better. This will be great. It explains how the human body works. Look! How interesting! Food machine, chewing machine, how the blood circulates, how we breathe... How interesting! Here is mouth and inside, teeth. There is saliva. This man opens the lid, and the apple goes into the stomach, then to the intestine, the colon, and the colon goes to... To the toilet. And what does this man do? Pull the chain. And what does he do? - Vomits. - Yes. And this one? - Smile. - Yes. Look, the incisors are in front, and the molars behind. Why? So that when eating, like this apple, the incisors tear a piece, the tongue moves it backwards, the molars grind it, then it goes down. Why? Because you can't swallow an apple whole. Why? Because it's too big. And you must eat so you don't starve. Why? Because people need nutrition or they'll die. Why? Because people are like that. All the creatures on Earth. They need energy and they get it from food. If not, they'll die. Why? Because that's how we're made. Why? It's like that and that's it. This is how it was created. Why? I don?t know, Bruno. Do you know what? Look at this. There is blood, how we breathe, how we talk, the ears, the eyes... Do you see how interesting it is? Here is the eye. I have to work a little. Is that alright? When is mom coming back? She'll be back right away. Dad! I'm made different than you. Really? How's that? Do you have a pine tree? What? I don't. I do. Do you have pine roots? I don't. I do. Do you have a mango heart? Bruno, please ... I do. Bruno! Where are you? Come on, I'll read you a story! Come out now! You hid very well, but no more games now! Hello, it's me. I lost Bruno... I don't know. I looked everywhere. I don't know. I went to the bathroom... I told him to read Busy City meanwhile, and when I came back, he was gone. No, he wouldn't go out alone. I looked in the stairs too. I don't remember, I'm very worried. Where are you? Look around. Maybe he went to look for you. OK. Kisses... Goodbye. Should we call police? What if someone came and took him? I don't know. I'm not sure he isn't here. I don't know. I have a bad feeling. Goodbye. I found him. Never mind. - Hello. - Hello. What are you carrying there? I found it at the flea market. And the others? A house is burning. They're watching the fire. Can I have another beer? Of course. Can I ask you something? Sure, tell me. Not now, when you have time. I have a time now. Let's rest a little. Do you want to watch the movie? - Yes. - Now you may. Have a nice day! It's nothing, just that... What would you say if someone...? Well, a woman... With another man. If this woman was married, and was with another man... Fooling around? Yes. Let's suppose it happened to Eszter. What would you do? I'd kill. Who? Eszter or the other man? I'd castrate the guy, and Eszter, I'd tie her up, take pictures with a large banana up her ass and publish it online. To Eszter? Have you gone crazy? What's with Eszter? Nothing, nothing... How come nothing? You started it. What's the matter with Eszter? You know we have no friends, you're the closest to us... I don't want to seem ridiculous, but you're my best friend. And? Tell your best friend? Maybe you don't feel that way, and I'm not yours, but ... OK, Albert... Yes, I mean... Family is the strongest tie, so... Sorry. What were we talking about? Nothing. But, for example... If Ernella did what Eszter did? That is, hypothetically. What happened with Ernella? Well, a bit of everything. What? She lost control. - Do you mean...? - Yes. Are you sure? I'm sure. I was mowing the lawn that afternoon, and I went to the barn, and there she was with Mr. Cole. Who's that? The owner. The farm was his. - Oh? - Well... But what were they doing? Because if they were only fooling around... It was a little more than that. OK, but what? When I arrived, it was almost over, but I asked her about everything. They did everything. - That's rough... - It's rough? I mean, hey... If it's so... It's like that. Sex is sex. It's just that. Yes. It's how we were created. It's biological. And chemistry. This is how we work. Yes, that's true. And Ernella? It's fine, she left it behind. She says she doesn't love him at all. She says she didn't know what she was doing. Didn't know? There was another person inside her who took control. But... Well, what matters is that it wasn't love. Think so? Yes, that's most important. Was he handsome at least? The guy? I don't know. I'm not a woman. A normal Scottish guy. You tell me. - Oh fuck. - What? I thought he was older. How old is he, Albert? 24. That's rough... You think it's rough? You seem like friends here. Yes. That fucking hypocrite. So what do you think I should do now? Nothing. It's over. It happened. You have to be the bigger man. That's all. It's over. Morally, you're above them. You must forgive. I try, but this picture always appears. Try to overcome it. Think of Laura. Yes, yes, Laura. There it is. Do you smell the smoke too? Laura, your shoes! - Hello, Ernella. - Hello. Farkas! Farkas! There was house on fire. The roof was burning. A burning beam fell on a new car that they hadn't moved from there. - Laura, don't bore Farkas. - No, let her talk. And the fire was so big that the firemen couldn't approach. They could only wet the other house, they were trying to save other houses. - Luckily, nobody died. - Bruno? He's watching something. Has Dad been angry with you? He hasn't. Kiss me. There was so much smoke... Wait a minute, Laura. Let's go get the car. I don't know where I put my wallet. Are you kidding? I have money. Ernella, have you seen my wallet? Don't be silly, Pay me back later. We'll be right back. Farkas! Will you read my story? Of course I'll read it. When we get back. - Promise? - Yes. Laura! Play with Bruno. Would you like a coffee? Yes. How do you take it? With a little milk. The weather's depressing. In Scotland it's always like that. Do you get tired? Only middle of the afternoon. It's like this every day. That's why the Italians invented the siesta. Yes, the nap. Not a bad idea. They know how to do things! Work, nap, a little more work, another nap. I'd very much like to live in Europe. Well, if you move there, we could visit you. I don't think we're going anywhere for a while. Why? We'd need a bit of... Money? No. Money, no. Well yes, that too... A kind of impetus, or... I don't know, a... A shared ambition. A belief in this family. Don't you believe in it? I do. Then? Farkas. I mean, I don't believe either, when I see Farkas doesn't. But from outside you seem in harmony... Basically, we are. When we're together and Bruno isn't there, it's like everything was fine. But we can't make the kid thing work. Our two didn't become three. We have similar character, - and Farkas doesn't know how to... - Forgive? He can't forgive, Ernella. - He forgives... - He doesn't know how. He's moving away, He wants to break with this. He's withdrawing. Runs away from home, then when he's home, shuts down completely. I noticed. Lately he's very reserved. Reserved, yes. And in a way, irritated. You know how that usually ends. A girl in her twenties will appear with daddy issues and goodbye. It's the only element Farkas is missing. I don't want to wait for that to happen. But then, what do you want? I don't know. I think I'm going to tell him I want a divorce. I'd never have thought that... How long have you been together? Almost 20? 18 years. I was 20 when we met. Keep going, you're a model for us. If you split up... I won't know what to believe. Well, believe in your own family. I do. More and more. You don't know this, but Albert... He has a very big heart. He's so generous... I can't even describe it. I'm very happy you're here. Me too... Me too... Shall we go out somewhere tonight? Good idea. No, wait. Dad is coming to dinner. - Did you tell him we were here? - Yes. What did you say? Why we returned? You haven't told us. That's true. Now we have to pull it toether. Not at all, relax. No need to stress. - Let's go for a smoke. - Sure. You can come in now. Good evening! Good evening. Ninth row, fifth seat. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. Second row, fourth seat. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. Third row, fifth seat. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. Box seats. Thank you. Masks? Well, what a strict usher! Please, put on your masks if you would be so kind. Ladies and gentlemen... The show will begin. Please turn off your cellphones. Recordings are not permitted. The title of the work is Davin and the Animals How long is this show? Three acts with two intermissions. It shouldn't be too long, because grandpa is coming. And I still have to make dinner. OK, it won't be that long. Once, there was a little boy. This little boy loved animals. Unfortunately, he lived in apartment blocks in the city, where animals were not allowed. The little boy was very sad, and he always walked alone on the street. Oh, and I forgot to mention, he did not know how to whistle very well. One day, when he was on the street, A parrot flew up to him. "Hello, little boy, I can understand your whistle." Whistle, Bruno. "I don't want to stay, I'll go with you if you want." And so they left together, and arrived at a bus station. There, they found a snake. "Hello, little boy." "I've escaped my terrarium and I'm hungry." Make it shorter, grandpa will arrive soon. Very well! Then many animals started following Davin, and they came to a river. There was a large ship docked, with no owner. Then Davin said, "Let's leave the city and go very far!" So Davin and the animals got on the ship, And they navigated a river between beautiful mountains. The only problem was that the river had many waves, and the animals were very frightened. Then Davin got the idea to go buy an iron, and he ironed the waves until they were flat. But the water boiled away and then the river was dry. "So how do we continue now?" We're not going anywhere, you idiots! We're already here! Then, rain began to fall, and in the river bed there grew... wonderful trees and flowers, and it became the most beautiful place in the world. And they wanted to live there for the rest of their lives. So they chose Davin as their captain. And so the story ends. How smart you are! Give me five! Ernella, where's my razor? It's amazing how fast they became good friends. Yes, it must be in the bottom of your drawer. It would be great if they could be together more often... - Is someone in the bathroom? - Laura? Eszter! What's up? What are you doing? - Dinner. Do you want to help? - No. Don't smoke indoors, okay? I feel terrible. Why? I don't know. I feel empty inside. I see no future. Why? You used to respect me, You admired me, you made me proud. You never spoke against me in public. That place is now Bruno's. All your energy, all your love, it goes to him. I'm just... I fuck things up, I ruin everything. - That's not true. - Unfortunately, it is. I look at myself in the mirror and I see a man for whom... I say things I don't want to say. You have no idea how much I respect and admire you. Obviously. - You say that because... - I'm serious. Sure... Why? Why would you respect me? Because you are a sensitive man. You are intelligent, you are masculine... Masculine? What's masculine about me? Everything. But what? Your hands, your voice, your aura, The way you speak, Did I say that already? Maybe I'm happy, but normally I don't know. Ernella asked me for two hundred. - Will you give it to her? - Yes. - How long will they stay? - They don't know. Anyway, we have room. You're beautiful. You're aging well. - Should I get changed? - Yes, it would be better. - What should I wear? - A white shirt. Really? White? Please welcome to the stage... Daniel Johnston! Please welcome to the stage... Daniel Johnston! Don't want to be free of hope And I'm at the end of my rope It's so tough just to be alive When I feel like the living dead I'm giving it up so plain I'm living my life in vain And where am I going to? I got to really try Try so hard to get by And where am I going to? I don't know where is up or down And there ain't any love left around Everybody wearin' a frown Waiting for Santa to come to town You're giving it up so plain You're living your lives in vain And where am I going to? You've got to really try Try so hard to get by And where am I going to? Flip on your TV And try to make sense out of that If we were all in the movies Maybe we wouldn't be so bored We're giving it up so plain We're living our lives in vain And where are we going to? You gotta really try Try so hard to get by And where are we going to? Goodbye... 01:23:35,174 --> 01:23:38,274 Goodbye, thank you, good night!
