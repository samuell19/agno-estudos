I had a great passion for taking photographs of myself. Whenever my mother would buy me new clothes I would wear them and take photographs. Now I feel terrible when I look at these. All I can see is how I used to look and how now I have to always hide my face. I know I won't ever again be as God made me but hopefully it will get better for me. Patients, register yourself at the reception. My husband burned me. I was sleeping and he came inside and just threw acid on me. He just didn't want me. I was thirteen years old at the time of the attack. My school teacher wanted to be with me but I refused and then he threw acid on me. One night I was sleeping and he came and threw acid on my shoulder. A year later he came back and threw it on my face. All because we rejected his proposal. I was an innocent child. Why did he ruin my face? What did I do wrong? Zakia, that's your name? I'm Dr. Jawad. I'm here working with Dr. Tariq. So how are you? I'm OK today. How old are you? Thirty-nine. What happened to you? I was attacked with acid. By who? By my husband. Can you take the glasses off? Is it just your face or all over? Did you have any basic treatment like a skin graft? They just dressed me and... - But no operation? - No operation. My marriage went bad from the start. He was a drug addict and alcoholic. And he would take money from me and when I ran out of money he would abuse me. He would beat me. When I couldn't take it anymore I finally went to the court to file for divorce. So outside the courthouse he confronted me. "So you want to divorce me?" "I'll make a spectacle out of you for the world to see." And he threw acid on me. He used battery acid. The highest quality and undiluted. It took one second to ruin my life completely. One second. He thought he could just escape and no one would find out. But he got caught and now he's in jail. And there's an ongoing case against him. Are you married? Yes. Do you have children? No, I don't. What's your wife's name? I don't think it's important to tell you that. Did you give her a divorce? No. Why not? She's mine, I've married her. It's a matter of my dignity. How can I just divorce her? Why did she want to divorce you? What happened? Whatever happened happened. I never intended to do this and I didn't do this. This is a conspiracy against me. Some other man burned her face? Yes. What's his name? I don't know his name. But you were there. Yes I was there but I don't know him. She had an affair which no righteous husband can tolerate. Okay. This was bound to happen! Women are all over the place. Doing their "good work." What kind of good work? To cut the world's nose. Rukhsana? How old are you? Twenty-five. What happened to you? Acid attack. Who did it? My husband threw acid on me and my sister-in-law threw gasoline on me. So your husband threw acid on you? Yes and my sister-in-law threw gasoline on me. And then my mother-in-law lit a match and set me on fire. And where do you live now? With them. I live with them. You still live with them? Yes, my kids became very sick and I couldn't afford to take care of them anymore so I had to move back into my husband's house and I had to make up with them. This is where they burned me alive. My life was destroyed in this room. They latched this door from outside so that I would suffocate to death. They threw acid on me, burned me alive. When I'm in this room I'm frightened. I remember that incident. My husband has always been abusive. He would beat me up all the time. Torture me. So you have never abused your wife? No. Never in these eight years of marriage. So you never threw acid on your wife? No. In fact nobody threw acid on her. She has high blood pressure and a temper. When she loses her temper she goes out of control. One day she lost her mind and threw gasoline on herself. A candle was burning nearby. The gasoline accidentally fell on it and caught fire and she was engulfed by the flames. So will a married woman with two children simply throw acid on herself? Yes. Go visit the burn unit someday. You'll see 99% of the women there have burned themselves alive. What's that burn mark on your hand? That was from... from when I was putting out the fire. Who's hiding behind the door? These are the new recruits. Older members, please tell the new people how you went through the same thing. In the beginning when I first got burned my pictures were so scary. My neck, everything. I was scared to look at it. It took us a while to gather courage. We used to be so scared at first. But now we have no such tensions. Zakia this is exactly what I was telling you... I am not that confident. Someday I will be. After meeting these women I got a lot of courage. But not enough to face the world without covering my face. With my face burned I can't go to any weddings or funerals, or any other occasions. My case is ongoing. I have a court date tomorrow. I've found a lawyer. She is especially passionate about women's cases. And she is fighting my case for free. I don't know how I would've fought this without her. Hello Madam. Hello Zakia. How are you? Please sit. Tomorrow your court hearing begins. He's denied all allegations and says he's innocent. "I did not throw any acid on her..." If not him then who threw the acid? Well, in order to shatter the defense we need to prove that our witnesses are credible. I am also going to mention some verses from the Quran on disfigurement in the court during our hearing. But it depends on the court. I can't say before then what the verdict will be. Zakia is a very brave woman. Most women in our society do not come to the courts for justice. Our present laws are too lenient and most culprits are acquitted. It would be great if we could set a precedent with Zakia's case. I suggest there should be a death sentence. Ask the victims! Make them stand on the podium and ask them what they want. The death penalty cannot be proposed as a punishment. In Pakistan human rights activists have been fighting that for 30 or 35 years. I don't think that's going to have an impact. Immediately the culprit should be taken to the town square and have the same thing done to him. If Islam permits it why don't we use such punishment? I'm very happy about what's happening here. God willing this will happen. We'll all pray for it. All husbands who throw acid on their wives should be punished. What about the non-husbands? Okay even those! We're smiling now because we're getting attention but if you look into our hearts then you'll know what we really feel. I'm really nervous. How will I speak in front of so many people? Come on you'll be fine. Even our own people do not recognize us any more. This is such an injustice to us. Someone must stop these brutal people who made us into the living dead. Oh my fellow countrymen, my lawmakers, my government your daughters seek justice from you. When did this happen to you? About two years ago. Although my husband was arrested the same day my in-laws are wealthy and so they all got out right away. So where are they now? They're all free. And what about you? They told me to stay quiet, not to tell anyone. They told everyone that I caught fire because an oil lamp fell on me. My face is ruined! My life is ruined! And nobody was punished at all. Where is the justice? Now my only request to you is that you do something for helpless women like us so we get justice. If they throw acid on us, the law should allow us to throw acid on them. We thought about that but we can't permit it. So we have proposed a law that will punish them with life imprisonment. We are trying our best to pass this law in the assembly. My face is getting tighter and tighter. It's getting worse every single day. It's very difficult to even eat or drink anything. I can't tolerate this pain anymore. I'm really happy and I want to thank God because my wish is about to be fulfilled. I hope my lips get fixed and then my nose and then my eye. This is going to be my rebirth. I'm having a party. And if you can restore somebody's life I don't think I need to be bloody religious to go where I need to go eventually. There is nothing in there. It's just illogical for it to survive at this stage. I can't see anything. So the whole ball is shrunken so Dr. Ankelsaria will agree there's no eye to save here and in fact the orbit is so badly damaged it won't support a glass eye. It's too late. OK guys. That's unfortunate. Let's close her up. By Monday or Tuesday we'll let you go home. What about my nose? That's the next stage. When this is stable we'll have to do some more clever things. We'll meet again in the next couple months. They are keeping my daughter away from me. My daughter lives on the other side of this wall. They made this wall so that I'd never see my daughter again. They won't let me be with her. They don't let me see her. They don't want me to have anything to do with her. I reconciled with them for the sake of my child but they stole her from me. How will I live this life that God gave me? It's better to die than to live this awful life. And here is the heartbeat. Can you see the heartbeat? So in fact you are pregnant and your baby is eight weeks old. Didn't you take any measures for birth control? Yes, I did for a while but then I started having problems. Then I left it all to God. Perhaps God wants to bring me joy through this baby. Aren't you worried? Don't you realize what happened to you could happen to your child as well? I am really sad that my scheduled surgery won't happen. But my new baby will bring happiness back to me. I hope I have a boy because a girl's future gets risky after marriage. I wouldn't want my daughter to face the same plight as me. In our society boys live well. Girls are often unhappy. That's why I want a baby boy. My husband has never seen my face because I always wear a burqua in court. I always wear glasses. He has never seen my face. Whenever I go to court for my hearings I see no remorse in his eyes. He stares at me like he's going to eat me alive. God willing I will get justice. I'll fight until the end. I'm not going to let him go. He destroyed my life. Our case is strong but it's up to the judge. The worst-case scenario would be... if he is acquitted. He has been threatening Zakia so I'm worried that if he is acquitted he might harm Zakia. I thought I was going to receive the final verdict today. But the date was extended again because of his lawyer. His lawyer does this all the time. I just hope I get another court date soon. It's all up to God now. In every corner of Pakistan there is a victim of acid crime. This is terrorism! And the culprits often go scot-free. God willing today a new Pakistan will be born through this acid crime legislation. This is a gruesome crime! And our courts have failed to give the culprits the punishment they deserve. Through the Acid Crime Legislation we want a law that will save the life of the woman. Today I would like to congratulate all the women of Pakistan because today history was made. Our fight is not over yet. It still continues. Thank you. Ever since I filed the charges he's been threatening me. He says, "When I get out I'll destroy your entire family." I can't take it anymore. I pray that they can keep him in jail. You didn't say your prayers today? No. - Why didn't you? Didn't feel like it? - I don't know. - Did you get lazy? - No that's not the case. Okay. Will you go to school tomorrow? I'm not sure if I will. I don't feel like it. You don't feel like it? Why not? I'm really nervous. I can't take these hardships on us anymore. I just want everything to be over. And that will finally be a happy day for us. You should pray for God's will to end all of this. - Tell me a joke. - Should I tell a joke? Tell the one with the cat - the one where it changes colors... - I don't know that one, I've forgotten it. Okay. Tell me one you remember... Greetings, Madam. Hello please sit. Zakia your verdict has come. Do you want to know the details? Yes please, I have been waiting anxiously for it. It's a very detailed verdict. Everything has been discussed. And his motive is also mentioned in it. Yes Madam tell me the verdict. Under Act 7C in the 7th section... Yes? He has been given two life sentences! - Not one but two life sentences! - Thanks a million to God. First tell me what happened with your court case? He received a double life sentence. Sir, this is the first time ever to punish a case under the new law. - You are the first case to be tried under this law? - Yes. How do you feel? I feel great! It's a strong message. They used to think it's a joke. That nothing will ever happen. I admire your courage. I'm really proud of you. Do you remember her? Your face has settled well. I'm really pleased. Zakia, the last time we operated on you we realized that your eye is completely damaged. It won't even support a glass eye. There's only so much I can do for you. We have our limitations. We can't be God. To recreate all your loss such as your eyebrows, eyelashes and eyelids for that I've got a top guy from Dubai who will make a prosthesis for you. But you'll have to wear that prosthesis externally. So that's my plan? All right? Brilliant. First I thank God then I thank you. Come meet your mother. How do I look? You look fantastic. She really looks fantastic. You've got your old mom back? She was lost for awhile wasn't she? How are you? Fine. Congratulations on your boy. What name have you given him? Mohammad. And I hope that he studies hard and becomes a doctor like you. And not like his father. God willing. I will fulfill my promise to you. But we must wait for about six months or so. Then we'll do our surgery on you. You look beautiful. Really? Today is the first day since the acid attack that I've left my house without my veil. Without my burqua, without my sunglasses. I feel really good. I have changed a lot since my acid attack. And hopefully some of these things will still get worked out. I am ready to begin my new life. And God willing tomorrow seems much better than today.
