My mother was a magician - of sorts. I learned this at an early age and prayed it was somehow hereditary. Oh, Bo-Skeet... When I was seven years old, I had a guinea pig. His name was Gus and his favorite food was lettuce, so I decided that's all he should have. A few days later... he's cold...and stiff. My mother put him in a roasting pan and baked him on 200 degrees in her antique chocolate brown range. She was a good cook, but for some strange reason whenever she made cinnamon toast, she burned it. And since Gus was lying prostrate in the same vessel reserved solely for burning cinnamon toast, I thanked the baby Jesus she set the timer. [timer dings] What do you think about one more minute, hm? One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... My daddy and mean-assed sister, them of little faith, kept their vigil from underneath the live oak in the back yard - Hamlet's gravediggers drop-kicked into the Gulf Coast of Alabama. When you see even the distant kin of a miracle unfolding before your very eyes, you by God better take it in. 'Cause life may not dole out another one for ten, twenty, thirty years. Or you may be dead and in hell before you see another one. [guinea pig squeaks] [she gasps] As I went to the window to shove my change of fate in the gravediggers' faces, I pretended their heads were on fire, but they couldn't put 'em out because they had pin cushions for hands. Speaking of hell and fire, I found myself a few decades later in the city of angels. [bluetooth buzzes] Hey, it's Phillip... ...an actor about to get the news he was past his date of expiration for anything other than erectile dysfunction commercials. Wait, wait, wait, so..so..so...you're saying I didn't get the part 'cause I'm not Steve Carell? They can't afford Steve Carell, which is why they were seeing me! But I AM the southern Steve Carell, which is what you said they were looking for, which is what I am! I mean, Steve Carell can't even be the southern Steve Carell, I mean, he can't be - he's from - he's from what - Canada or - or - or - Minnesota something - I don't know, he's from somewhere cold! What do you mean, they said I was too old. They said I was too old? But I'm not any older than Steve Carell! What a remarkable journey from theatre to film and TV- They say those who can't teach, and those who never got their big break assist the evildoers who did. ...a director of that stature... could you just 'scuse me one second please? There is a shithole magazine here. Yep. Yeah. Why didn't I know about it? I told you about it yesterday AND it's on your phone AND it's on your Things To Do Today List. Hm. Okay. Did you get my bras? Oooh, love you! If you run my life forever I will give you a big fat fucking raise every fucking year. 'Kay? (Director)Places, everyone! [sighs] [bluetooth buzzes] Hey, this is Phillip... Bo-Skeet? It's me, Sis. -Hey Sis, let me call you back. -No! You'll get busy and I won't hear back from you for a week! Not true. I'll call you in, like, later. Tina has cancer. What? Lung cancer. Lung cancer? Come on, Tina doesn't smoke. Well, it's stage four and it doesn't look good. She's been going to chemo for a couple of months trying to extend things if she can. [sighs] How long have you guys known this? We didn't wanna bother you with all you've got going on. You'd never know it to look at her. Laquita Batley stopped us coming out of the Food Tiger the other day... "Looking at y'all's like looking at The Judds, which one's the mother, which one's the daughter?" Okay, just stay with me here, Sis, okay? Just...how is she? Don't you wanna know how I'm doing? Of course. How...are you? She wants to talk to you. She's getting divorced. Again. Can you believe this? Are you coming home? I...uh...I don't- I risked my whole life to have you...sorry. You know I'm not that kind of person, I'd never... Oh, God. Abbe-Gail cleans only where I'm not so she won't have to see me. [groans in pain] Oh, God. She just won't stop doing whatever it is she's doing and it's driving me crazy. And your father's not any better, don't even get me started on him. Oh, please, come home, just for, you know, just for a couple of days... so I can see somebody who's not start raving mad. Do you see the irony in this whole thing? I spend half my life in the looney box and now I'm the one who has to hold everybody together. A daunting task to say the least. Oh gosh, your father's just as bad. Look at the two of them. Pulling their weeds. I miss my buddy. (Phillip) No, it's my mother. Okay, doll, call me back. What's going on? Oh, ah...Easter time, I'm going home and... I'm suddenly five again. Hm. So what does five look like? You know? I remember three different years... I don't know if it was a mixture of springtime revival... promise of new things, whatever... Tina would decide that she was gonna finally take her life by the horns and live it according o her own terms... go back to school, get a job... and then she would promptly proceed to have a nervous breakdown before spring was sprung. Wow, that's tough. One year they came and got her like a lamb for slaughter. About a month later she'd come home high on whatever until she could cope with the fact that she was never actually gonna take her life by the horns. Phillip, why don't I know this? Not really something I cared to relive, I guess. You coming back to bed? I don't know. You know... I considered climbing into your knapsack and stowing away on your flight to Tennessee Williamsland. That's sweet. You are sweet. And maybe not the best idea in the world. [sighs] So I guess this is probably it. You and me. Long time coming. Yeah. [sad chuckle/moans] I remember the time when I wanted to live right here. You know, I should take you back to your place. Gonna be an early flight for you. [sighs] Maybe I will come back to bed.

She's a professor and... there's actually nothing marmish about her. We're sorta busted up. Well, depending on what day of the week it is. I'm just pulling your leg, sugar.

If you didn't look back, we're good to go. (Phillip) I can't believe people still do this down here. That's right, that's right now. Jeanie Wright passed a hay truck and even though she didn't look back, she still saw it in her rearview mirror and BOTH her babies were born dead. -Both of 'em, that's right. -I don't believe that.

Well, let's don't jump off the burning bridge just yet, -you know? -I taught you that. She's been out by the pool painting all morning. I finally got her situated under a shade tree.

Now, where the Dickens was it the first time? Uh. And then Dr. Jim called me at home, told me I had lung cancer, didn't even bother to ask me if I was by myself, which I was. Good to see you. Hey.

Sis - you will actually like this Macrobiotic and Cancer-Free. About a woman who heals herself from lung cancer on a ying-yang diet. Is this one of those California things? -No. It's not. -'Cause if it is- It's not one of those California things. Now. Macrobiotics teaches that cancer is caused by an imbalance in our bodies brought on by unbalanced eating. And that is not one of those California things? Didn't I say that it wasn't? [mosquito buzzing] Shit! Watch your mouth. Sorry. So. There's a couple who teach in the Smokies - sort of a 'commune,' if you will. -But it's not- -Commune? -That's gotta be-- -It's NOT- Some sort of sex camp... It's not a sex camp.

I was just thinking about this kid lived right through that patch of woods there - Greggie. Greggie? Holy shitballs, what a name. My father caught us in the pool house. We were just messing around. He took me out of public school the next day and put me to private school half an hour away. That's intense. I liked the girls. I mean, I had some amazing times. I knew I liked guys too, but they never liked me. I remember one day after I broke up with my college girlfriend, I said, "That's it! I'm playing for the other team whether they like it or not." Next night my head's between Carol Ann Lawley's legs and I'm thinking, "Slipped again, Stalworth." That's funny. You're funny. I was lying before when I said it, but now I'm not. [laughs] You sure guys never liked you? Never. Can I ask you something? Uh-oh. I was watching you. What? It's not like I was spying on you or anything- I always thought I closed the curtains when I did that. I was watching you run up that crazyassed driveway of y'all's. And you had something over your eyes. And pardon me for being blunt, but you looked like a lunatic. My daddy could do it. He could run backwards from the bottom of the driveway all the way to the top without falling. -Blindfolded? -Yup. [laughs] And how does a person figure they can do a thing like that? There was a system with numbers. Did he ever tell you what that system was? Nope. You southern boys are a curious lot. What are you talking about?

I tried to get your father to fix it for the longest time, then I gave up, decided I liked it without the light. Well, I thought I like it. Whatcha got there? Old photos. All of these subject's strengths and insecurities are put together in one pose. Flicker of clarity. Frozen in time. Of course, you're never aware when somebody's taking your picture that fifty years later that singular pose will forever define how somebody thinks of you. Just like that. Frozen. I always had a hunch that I was beautiful, talented, smart. But mother always said, "Don't you compliment her, she'll get the big head." When mother was dying in the hospital, I was holding her hand. She looked up. At first I thought she was looking at me. She said, "So beautiful." But then I realized she was looking just past me. Heaven. She saw heaven! How could I compete with that? Anyway, when I decided to have my own children, I swore that I would let you and your sister know that you were beautiful, talented and smart. Guess I left myself out of the equation. (Garrett) Hey. -Hey. What's doing? Planting a garden! We're starting small, see how it goes. Great. I give. Well, it's plans. Plans?

It just sounded like something my grandmother would have said. Shit. -It was nice- -Nice, he says. Oh, shit. I was in this bar in L.A. - with Frances. There were these two leather guys dancing cheek-to-cheek - the hat, the boots, the whole nine yards. I remember they were dancing to Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch - they were actually singing it to each other. And I thought, "That is ridiculous." Because it just sort of was, you know? All right, I am sorry I said it! I am damned sorry I said, subconsciously, something that was so unbelievably girly and nice and familiar. Don't be sorry! Now I'm embarrassed. Even though it was this insignificant, subconscious, tiny - shit, it's like saying 'pal' or 'dude.' I just thought that since there's a little bit more going on here than back-slapping and basketball God, I cannot believe I am having to justify myself here. No need to be sorry.

And it's part of every human - and former Hollywood assistant's natural inclination to keep watch over them night and day because there's usually someone - or something - waiting in the wings to make said miracles that much harder to tend. But watch we must as the only alternative is to simply let things take their own course. So what is it about eyesight, huh? One day you just wake up and it's gone - nothing. Well, this is a crazy idea to begin with. You'll be lucky to get a minnow, at best a mudpuppy. Yeah, we'll see. Just keep it slow and steady, I guess. You're kidding me, right?

No, it couldn't be. Well, it sounded like it. I was always so a'scared of thunder, and then my mother taught me this game. If you count - slowly - after the first boom of thunder, until you see the first lightning flash, then that's how far away the lightning is. So if you can count to three, then you know the lightning is three miles away. That's not it. The lightning comes first. You count from the lightning, and you wait for the thunder. Oh.
