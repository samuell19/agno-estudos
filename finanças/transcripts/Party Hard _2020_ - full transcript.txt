You know, everyone can't seem to see when they got something good right under their nose. - So you're telling me your father's father whoever told you we were both going to have the same dumb clown dream. - Man he could have owned land in five different states but fucking lawyers got him owning a quarter of a penny on the dollar owing to fucking Barnum and Bailey. - Shit, so your lineage like started the circus. - God damn straight it did. - Does that make you like Mr. Barnum? - Well ain't no Britannica book gonna tell you that shit. - Britanna-who-ma-what now? Oh come on, man, God damn it. Can y'all get any younger? I mean I swear to God I thought it was bad in the Hootie and the Blowfish days. - Alright, what's your name then, old man? Got all the fucking answers. - In your eyes, I see it. Don't go sell yourself some fake dream. Just some little portion of your stubby little self, God dammit. - How am I? - Listen, I don't know. I don't have all the answers. I'm sitting here right beside you, aren't I? It's just in my blood to see when a man is headed down the path, of swiping up, sweepin' up fucking peanut shells at his own damn show. You know what I'm saying instead of owning the land. Tending to his kin. - What were they selling your granddad out in Chicago? - Well, he sold out his livelihood, but every man gets their swing at redemption. To our past. Our blood, family's blood and those who came before us. And uh, hell, what's the, how's it go? - Staying woke? - What the fuck is that? - It's like when, fuck it, cheers man. Fucking Barnum and Baileys. (song ends) - That's so nice of you, that's his celery. I can't touch a man's celery, you know what I mean? - [Woman] You can get celery, you can even dip it. - Y'all just like ranch straight up in celery? Like no wings or nothing? - Yeah, nothing. - [Ty] I guess it's a good drinking food. - [Woman] That's a well-balanced diet. - So you get, you get some of the goodness from like the ranch and the blue cheese but you also get the hydration because it's like all water in celery. You know what I'm saying? So like instead of drinking water, eating it, it's perfect. (laughing) - Yes. - That's a fucking good way to be. ("The Wolf" by E.Z. Shakes) - Why do you think it is we met tonight? - You mean besides the part where you were scrounging for free alcohol at my friend's party? I really don't know how to answer that. But why does there have to be a reason? - Don't you believe in some measure of fate in meeting people? - I mean, I guess some people enter our lives for a reason and some people are in our lives for a season and some people don't ever leave because they don't know what a fuck off face looks like. - Touche. But what would Kant say on the matter? - Oh, he'd probably want to know what your categorical imperative is. - Oh yes, categorically speaking, of course. So you don't believe in small talk? - No, I mean, although I understand it happens. - And you don't put stock in fate. So what is it you do believe? - The cosmos, like life is about what happens. Okay, it's not about what happens to you. It's about making choices, right? So asking yourself, what do I believe in, what's important to me, What are my priorities, what is my gauge for deciding what is good and bad? But the only question like really worth asking yourself is what do you want? - I am so sorry. I thought you were like doing a thing and setting up like a moment. I misread that. - No, I, I, no, I get it, right. Like how far you can push this. We could blame it on the whiskey or maybe you were just like so amused by my wit or whatever. So what's her name? (Chandler sighs) Yeah, that's what I thought. - What- - No, don't ruin it. Can we just, can we just? - When I saw you tonight, I wasn't really thinking of- - No, we're like tonight now. So you were going to tell me about what's her name. - Lauren. - Right. So you guys like trying to go out together or like, oh my God is that, is she the reason you moved? Is she the reason you left? - All right, partly, partly. Honestly, it was just, I was living in a rut, you know, I was living my life in a rut and then I met her and then she like carved out this hole in the rut that was hers, you know? And then she was gone and that hole was empty and suddenly I realized that I hated this rut that I carved out for myself and I decided to do something about it. Like, I don't know, I don't know what yet, but I had to make a move. So, I made it. - Can I tell you something? Okay, so whatever reason you had for walking away from that, that's okay, like that's enough. Like you made a choice and like, and you're figuring it out. Maybe you don't know everything right now but you don't have to. You want to believe our meeting was fate. Maybe I'm your wake-up call. You should take closure where you can get it, but know that you deserve more than to be stuck in this limbo of what ifs. Who knows? All right, I gotta go. - Just like that? - Just like that. Damn it, I knew I should've been less charming. (Lily laughs) - [Ty] Bro, bro, yo, check this out. - Fuck. - Jules just told me he had a botched circumcision, dude. Like what? That dudes fucking dick is all fucked up. He just told me that. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. But I can't let him live this shit down, bro. - It's fine. (Ty laughs) - Hey, I'm sorry, hey, my guy said something weird? He got something in his teeth? - No, no, no, he did good. He just, no, he did fine. He just needs to close out some stuff before he can, you know, close. - What, did you? - No, I'm just that good. - Yo, you're fucking very good, very fucking good. - Okay, don't go swimming with any dolphins anytime soon. And hey Jules, you're doing great, man. But just enough with the talking to yourself. It only attracts the crazies. All right, so, all right you non-Ubering dumbasses, get home safe. - Oh, you Ubering fuck, bye! - I'm completely lost.

I just, I want to see you before you move away. - You act like we're never going to see each other again. - That's because that's what it feels like, okay? - [Lauren] You'll see me again. - Like tomorrow? - You mean today? - Whichever. - [Lauren] Why do you do this to yourself? - I don't know. I guess it's, I'm hopelessly devoted to the notion that we're going to work things out. - [Lauren] We tried to make it work. - Yeah, so you're just gonna throw away four years like that? - [Lauren] I'm not. - That's what it feels like. - [Lauren] While we haven't always been perfect, I don't regret anything. - Why are you leaving? - [Lauren] You moved to Charleston. - Yeah, but you're gonna move to Clemson. - [Lauren] I explained this to you. - Yeah, yeah, it's better classes. Yeah, no, no, I, I get it, no, that makes sense. Why didn't you ask me to go with you? - [Lauren] You still don't get it, do you? - Obviously not, Lauren, so please explain it to me. - [Lauren] When you told me you were moving to Charleston you didn't think I knew it was out of spite? - Oh please, here we go, here we go. - [Lauren] Instead of dealing with something, you jumped ship. - No! - [Lauren] You packed up and ran to Charleston. - No, that's not what happened? - [Lauren] Just like when things got serious with us, you ran off to Melanie. - Can we, let's not talk about that, okay? - [Lauren] I'm not trying to start a fight. - Oh, you could've fooled me. - [Lauren] I'm simply saying that when you told me about Charleston I knew it was because of us, but I also got excited for you. - Excited? - Yeah, excited. Excited that maybe you could finally let go of all this anger and start over. - I tried. I don't, I don't, I, I, I tried to let go, okay, but I, I don't know, here I am, back here. - [Lauren] Yeah, well, staying out till four in the morning isn't going to help you make any progress. - I guess not, no. - [Lauren] You with Jules and Ty? - Yeah. - And how are they? - Oh, Jules is back on his Haley shit and Ty is- - Drunk? - Yeah, yeah, wasted, he's Ty. - [Lauren] I hate to cut it short, but some of us do have to get up and go to work in the morning. - Are you all right, man? - So can I see you? - I'll think about it, okay? - Yeah. - Get some rest. - [Chandler] Yeah. - [Lauren] Don't stay out too much later. - Alright. - Goodnight, Chandler. - Goodnight, Lauren. Close out your tab? - Yup. - Where's Ty? - He's inside right now. Bran's trying to wake him up. (keys jingling) You sure you're okay, man? - Yeah, I'm just fucking tired, alright? - Listen, I'm sorry you didn't get your dick looked at tonight. (door opens) - I don't know about y'all, but I'm fucking hungry. - Nope, it's pass the fuck out o'clock. - What, come on, Chan, I'll get you that peanut butter waffle you like. - No, we're leaving and I'm not fucking around. - Hey, who pissed in his cereal, man. He didn't get no play with the blue haired chick, now we're gonna act like that small dick energy. Jesus Christ, come on, man, I'll fucking call it ahead. - [Chandler] What part of I'm tired do you not understand? The sun is almost up, asshole. - [Ty] What you bucking up at me like that for? - Ty, what are we arguing about right now? - Cause I'm fucking hungry! - Right, because you're fucking hungry, and it's always like this, you know what, forget the other thousands of times it's been like this. Let's talk about tonight, alone. Just tonight, you want to be chauffeured around. You want to ride shotgun. - You do wanna go there. - You wanna bum cigarettes and now you want us to go get something to eat because you're fucking hungry. - Chan, shut the fuck up. - I'm just telling it how it is, bro. - [Ty] How about since we got here how you been talking man, I'm gonna some nookie, I'm gonna get some girls. - Fuck this. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you started this, okay? You're the one that brought this shit the fuck up. So you know what, let me lay it on you real quick, Chan. Real fucking fast. I love you, Chan, I really do. But you gotta get your fucking head out your ass. - You know something, Ty, I hate to burst your bubble you're not the first person that told me that shit. - Okay, well where's the fucking trust, bro? From when you made a pact with your boys, man. Why don't you just man the fuck up and tell us all that you moved and bitched out because of fucking Lauren. - You know what, just fucking leave her out of this, okay? - Then why'd you move? Why'd you move? - [Chandler] Because I had to get the fuck out of this town, all right. - Get the fuck out of town, why? Why the fuck should you get out of town where all your fucking friends are? - No, because I'm drowning here, Ty, all right? I can't keep doing this same shit every night. - You don't have to fucking do the same shit every night. All right, we had a fucking plan! - [Chandler] Ty, that wasn't realistic and you know that. - How was that not realistic? Why was it not realistic? Me, you, Jules, we had that plan to open that spot at State Street. - The plan was unrealistic and you know that, Ty. - [Ty] Why? - Because you can't keep doing the same routine. You gotta find a plan and stick with it. - Well, I'm sorry my fucking routine doesn't fit into your plan, motherfucker. But listen, I enjoy going out, like having nights like this with my fucking boys, you know what I'm saying? In a city that accepts me for who I am. I'm sorry you don't fucking get that. - I'm not saying- - Nah, nah, nah, I gotta sit here and really pretend like my best friend didn't just say to my face, that all this shit we've been through, all the shit that we planned the fuck out doesn't fit into your little routine. I'm sorry your fucking ass had to fucking move off to Charleston 'cause you got fucking butt hurt about some fucking girl. Hope you're finding your fucking path up there. I'm still fucking hungry!

Yeah, we're gonna get you a peanut butter waffle, don't you worry. - I think someone's having a bad day. - [Ty] All it takes is one bad day. - You know what they say about Batman, Bummer summer, bro. - Bummer summer, bro. How's that peanut butter waffle, was it good? You happy now? - Is anybody really happy? - Haley. - Shut up. - I swear to God, I was talking to a dude. - [Ty] You were talking to the bartender. - No, the old guy with the beard. - What old guy, dude? - His name was Miller and he was talking about how his granddad got screwed out of owning land in Wyoming and that he had run a circus for Barnum and Bailey. - Where you drinking a Miller? - No, I was drinking, I was drinking whiskey and Coke. You know, honestly, Preston and I had this conversation and he apparently doesn't always tell me what's in it. - God forbid you should not be able to trust your coke dealer. - You know who would be really awesome to never run into again? Adam. I understand you're mad but Adam's kind of ripped, dude. - Bro, y'all didn't see what happened inside that bar, dude. Y'all didn't see, I was swinging on this man. - Saw you get your ass thrown out. - Yeah by the bar, the doorman, okay. I was swinging on Adam and he was cowering, cowering. - Cowering? - Hands over his head, fetal position. - I went in there after you got kicked out and talked to him- - And he looked shook, didn't he? He was shook. - No, they were kind of chuckling. It's all good, man, I'm just fucking with you, bro. No, he looked upset. - Yeah, he was visually perturbed, I'm sure. (car passing) - It's gonna be a beautiful day. - You need me to drop you by your car? - Nah, I got 'em, I got 'em. Thanks, man, I was gonna pass out in my car. - Well, you can pass out in the back seat, 'cause, uh, shotty! - Ooh, sucks to suck. - Fucking assholes. ("Hey Beautiful" by E.Z.
