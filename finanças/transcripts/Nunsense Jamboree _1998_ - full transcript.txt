(audience applauding) (nuns squealing in delight) - Oh, thank you so much, we are so excited to be here. As Father Virgil told you, this is the first stop on our promotional cross country tour of Sister's new album "I Could Have Gone to Nashville". (audience laughing) (audience applauding) - Thank you. Actually, I did go to Nashville. So, maybe we shoulda called it "I Did Go to Nashville" instead of "I Could Have" because, like, that's a lot different than "I Could Have", you know. But anyway, I'm back now. Well, I'm not really back. If I were back, I would be at home in Hoboken, but I'm here with y'all in Nashville. (audience laughing) So in a way I am back, I'm, I'm... What were we talkin' about? (audience laughing) - Sister, remember what we practiced? - Don't tell me. Okay. Reverend Mother didn't want me to waste my talent, so she bribed a record producer here in Nashville to... (audience laughing) She convinced a record producer here in Nashville to do an album with me, and then she hired this fella to help me get my country accent back because I had forgotten that I had one when I had the amnesia, and now, here we are on this high falootin' tour, and here we are at the Grand Ole Opry. We're at the Grand Ole Opry-- Look, look! (audience laughing) - I'm so sorry to say that Reverend Mother couldn't be here. - Yeah, it just broke my heart. (Sister Robert Anne cackling) (audience laughing) - That'll do, Robert Anne! - (clears throat) Okay. (slams barn door) (audience laughing) - And that's the main reason Reverend Mother asked me to take charge of the tour. - There was somethin' else I was supposed to remember to tell them. - [Sister Wilhelm] What? - Sister Mary Leo, Leo, where are you? - I'm right here! - When Sister Leo was a real person... Well, you know. (audience laughing) Before she became a nun and all. Her name was Ronetha Jolene Trott (laughs). (audience laughing) And Father Virgil, where are you? - [Father Virgil] I'm in here! - Well, come on out. Father Virgil is Sister Mary Leo's real life brother. - And they grew up as part of Mississippi's famous Trott Family Singers. (audience laughing) - That's right! - Hold on here. I thought Leo was a ballerina from Elgen, Illinois. - No, no, no, we didn't move to Elgen 'til Ronnie Joe was 16. - But I can tell you, when you're from the Delta, you just can't hide your roots. (audience laughing) - That's true. When she first came to the Convent, we thought she was a redhead. (Sister Robert Anne laughing) (audience laughing) (exclaiming) (barn window slamming) (audience laughing) - None of this really matters. (audience laughing) What's really important, is that on this very stage tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we've got the Trotts. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Are y'all gonna sing somethin' from "The Sound of Music"? - (scoffs) Amnesia, those were the Trapps. We're the Trotts. - I knew that. (audience laughing) I guess this means we won't get to meet Julie Andrews. (audience laughing) - Ladies and gentlemen, before we go any further, we have to take a moment to thank three very special sponsors who have made our Jamboree possible. (piano riffing) "When you're looking for accommodations, "your first choice should be the Manger Inn. "Yes, the Manger Inn, where there is always room "for one more." (audience laughing) - "At the Manger Inn when you hit the hay, "you hit the hay." (audience laughing) And speaking of hay, I wonder, how many of you know that, "Every animal's favorite food "is Franciscan Fodder?" - "Their chow is good for everything from parakeets "to pandas, and it's always fit for a pig." (audience laughing) That's cute, "fit for a pig". (laughs) - Hey! You probably all came here by car or bus, right? Well the next time you choose an airline, consider "Ascension Air! "The airline that guarantees to get you off. (audience laughing) "The ground." Oh, "get you off the ground every Thursday." (audience laughing) - And remember, "Catholics get a plenty re-indulgence "every time you fly. (audience laughing) "Lutherans get a donut." (audience laughing) - And now we are very pleased to present Sister Mary Paul singing the title song from her debut album, "I Could Have Gone to Nashville".

(laughs) (audience laughing) (Sister Amnesia laughing) - Hey, I got one. Robert Anne, where are you? - [Sister Robert Anne] Yo, sister, here. - I got one. How can you tell if a nun is a blonde? - Oo, I give up. How can you tell if a nun is a blonde? - Like, oh, my God, I don't know. (audience laughing) (Sister Robert Anne giggling) (coop window slamming) - Hey, Mary Paul. - [Sister Amnesia] Yeah? - What do you call nuns at the Sistine Chapel? - I give up, what? - Ceiling fans! (audience laughing) (nuns laughing) (windows slamming) - (laughing) I don't get it. (audience laughing) But speakin' of fans, I have some little tokens of appreciation that I thought I would like to come down in the audience and maybe hand 'em out, and talk to a few of you, you're just such a great lookin' audience. What is your name, sir? - [Mark] Mark Lowry. - Mark, and are you from Nashville? - [Mark] I live right here. - Okay, and you're not Catholic, are you? - No, I'mma Baptist. (audience laughing) Baptist. - There's a lot of them down here. (audience laughing) I knew you weren't a Catholic, because if you were Catholic, you would know that we always stand up when Sister calls on us. (audience laughing) (audience applauding) I have somethin' very, very special for you. Mark? - Yes, Mark. - Yeah, it says it right there. Yeah. Look, it's a little stick-on-saint. - Oh, nice. (audience laughing) - Do you, do you Baptists know who that is? - Not that particular one. (audience laughing) - Oh, honey. - Looks Catholic to me. - It is... (audience laughing) It is Saint Joseph. And Saint Joseph was the foster father of our Lord, and he is the Patron Saint of carpenters. - Yes. - Yeah, now, (audience laughing) you know what's really great about this? You can just pull this off, just peel it off, and stick it on your power tool and stand back, Mark. (Sister Amnesia laughing) (audience laughing) (audience applauding) Yeah, go on have a, have a seat there. Thank you, Mark. Innit he cute? He's cute for a Baptist. (audience laughing) Linda Davis? Oh, my Lord, y'all, ladies and gentlemen, it's Lin, it's Linda Davis! (audience cheering) My Lord. I know. I know you're a big star and all, but you still have to stand up when Sister addresses you. (audience laughing) Oh, my Heavens, this is so wonderful. I just loved your duet you did with Reba. Yeah, and I mean, meetin' you is just kinda like, it's kinda like your hit record, "Some Things Are Meant to Be." This is so excitin', y'all. I have somethin' very special for you, Linda, you're about to become the proud owner of a bonafide relic. Ladies and gentlemen, this is an actual tooth from the head of Saint John the Baptist. (audience laughing) Now, I know some of you might be thinkin' that that's in poor taste, but I do want to assure you that we had it dipped in Scope, so it's minty fresh. (audience laughing) We've also had it authenticated by DNA experts in Los Angeles, California, (audience laughing) so we know it's the real thing. Now there's, there is a little warnin' on the box, Linda, it says, "If you open this box, "the precious tooth will turn "into a worthless piece of popcorn." I don't know, you feelin' lucky? - I feel lucky. - Should we give it a peek? - Let's look. - Oh, shoot. - What? (audience laughing) - Oh, darn, it's a little kernel. Oh, well maybe you could pop it in the microwave and have a little snack. (audience laughing) I'm so sorry. - Well, maybe some things aren't meant to be. - Oh, you're so cute, innit that cute? "Some things aren't meant to be." You are cute. (audience applauding) (exclaiming) Give her up some applause, yes. (audience cheering) Oh, my Heavens. Bless you. (audience applauding) She's so beautiful. I'm goin' over here, 'cause this guy's not lookin' at me, and he thinks I won't come. (audience laughing) (laughing) What's your name? - Paul. - You're not Catholic either, are you? - I'm Catholic. - On your feet, yeah. (audience laughing) For Heaven's sakes. A while since you got outta school, maybe, huh? - Yes. (audience laughing) - Well, we can forget some of these things. I have a really special thing for you, sweetie. Look at this, y'all. This is the actual rosary that was left by the Blessed Virgin Mary after her appearance at Chernobyl. (audience laughing) What'd you say your name was again? - Paul Henley. - Paul, this glows in the dark, Paul. - Sister Amnesia! (Sister Amnesia laughing) (audience laughing) - You hold onto that, Paul. You're gonna glow in the dark, too! (audience laughing) - Sister, Sister, it's time to move on. - I'm havin' a good time with Paul, here. - I know you are, that's good. C'mon up. - You're so cute. Sit down, sweetie. I've so many people to meet. - Well invite them-- - Did you see Linda Davis over there, huh? - Yes! - Yeah, Linda Davis is here, I'm so excited. - Invite them over for lunch, and you can meet them later. - Oh, lunch is a good idea. We'll do lunch. (audience laughing) Hey, you know what? We'll have to all bring a dish to pass 'cause there's a whole lot of ya. (audience laughing) - Yeah, that's right. - Hey, you know what?

(audience laughing) Oh, bless you, those of you who laughed. (audience laughing) I don't know how many of you know it out here, but Sister Amnesia's album is not the only cause for excitement around here. Next week, Sister Leo gets her black veil and her ring. - (whimpers) It's true, but I have to tell you, I am so nervous. I mean, this is it, innit? Do it or get off the pot, right? (audience laughing) - Well, I don't think I'd put it quite like that. (audience laughing) Yes, it's time to make a choice. - In my heart I know I wanna be here, it's just that it's like forever. - Oh, Sister, nothing is forever. I mean, look at what happened to Woolworth's (laughs). (audience laughing) I always say if you live in the moment, and trust your heart, the good Lord will help you with the rest. Lemme tell you a little story. When I was in high school, in Phoenix, Arizona, my sister and I won a contest to go to Hollywood and appear with Frankie Avalon in one of those beach blanket movies (laughs). - In a bikini? (cackling) No way. (audience laughing) - I think I'm being insulted. (audience laughing) - Oh, no, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that, it just seemed so weird to think of a beach babe becoming a nun. - Well, what's so weird about that? Dolores Hart became a nun. - I can't believe it. - Well, she did. - Oh, no, not that, that you were once a babe in a beach blanket movie. (audience laughing) - I'll have you know I had 12 lines. Frankie Avalon and I, like this. - Hot damn (slapping leg). (audience laughing) Diggity, diggity, I mean diggity. - You were right the first time (laughs). Oh, anyway, that's not why I'm tellin' you this story. The point I'm trying to make is that my sister fell madly in love with this guy in the movie. He said he loved her too, but he must've had some bad experiences, because he was afraid to trust his heart. (gentle piano music) He probably felt just like you.

Number one, use my skills as a nurse to make sure everyone stays healthy. Number two, add my voice to the festivities. Number three, make sure Robert Anne understands that the only reason she was allowed on this tour is because she knows how to drive a bus. (audience laughing) - She was just pullin' yo' leg. Y'know, you oughta watch that. You could develop a limp. - Robert. (audience laughing) - Oh, come on, come on, here. - What? - Just look at the title. 'Kay? (Sister Wilhelm sighing) "Play a Country Enut." - "A Country Enut"? I know I'm gonna regret this, but what, pray tell, is "A Country Enut"? - It's a country tune played backwards (laughs).

Just a moment, she's right here. - Who is it? - It's Reverend Mother calling from the Convent, she'd like to-- - Go get Father Virgil for the next number. Howdy, partner? Oh, that's country talk, Reverend Mother. What? Oh, yes, we're doing fine. Just a moment, lemme put you on the speakers so you can say hello. - Hello, friends. - Say "Hello" to Reverend Mother. (audience replies) - Just listen to that crowd! Reminds me of the time we were in Central Park. - Oh, yes, when we attended the Pope's Mass. - No, I'm talking about the Garth Brooks concert. (audience laughing) Listen, is Sister Amnesia there? - Oh, no, she's backstage, but she's doing great. - Well, at least you don't have to worry about her pulling out that foul mouthed puppet of hers. 'Cause I've got it hidden right here in my drawer just behind... Oh, my gosh. Oh, what is this? (toy squeaking) Oh, no! Listen, I'm gonna have to call you right back. Hubert! Hubert, get in here. (sighs) - Oh, I do hope everything's all right. Ladies and gentlemen, a word from Father Virgil Trott. (audience laughing) - All righty. I have been waiting for this moment. Because I have a really big-- - Surprise! (audience laughing) - Who are you? - Who am I? Who are you? I am Sister Mary Annette, star of stage, screen, and cable access. - What are you doin' here? You're supposed to be in Reverend Mother's drawers. (audience laughing) - Yeah, well I couldn't take the cramped quarters. (Sister Mary Annette giggling) (audience laughing) Now, look, I'm here to help. Amnesia thinks she can carry this show by herself, but face it, the broad's a wacko. - Sister, I wouldn't go that far. - Oh, really? How far would you go? (Sister Mary Annette giggling) (audience laughing) Don't answer that. Look, I'll admit Amnesia's been a pain in my rear. If you catch my innuendo. (Sister Mary Annette giggling) (audience laughing) But I think we should help her. - Maybe, but first I-- - Hey, hey, hey! How would you like to sing a duet with a huge star? - Dolly Parton? - Not that kinda huge. (audience laughing) Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a close, personal friend of mine from the hit TV series, "Mama's Family", Mrs. Thelma Harper! (audience cheering) - Thank you. Thank y'all. Well aren't you nice? Thank you. How you doin'? Oh, stop it. Stop it. Oh. Stop it, now. Get a grip. C'mon, sit on it. (audience laughing) - Mama? - Father. - Mama? - Sister. - Mama? - Brother. (audience laughing) Why does everybody call me that? I'm not your mama! Y'know what I think I'm gon' do? Listen up, y'all are gonna get a kick outta this. (audience laughing) I know you will, 'cause you're a fun group. (audience laughing) I'm thinkin' about openin' a little chain of Mexican restaurants. I'm gon' call 'em "Nacho Mama". (audience laughing) I'm serious, I've been thinkin' about this. You could have "Nacho Mama's Meatloaf", "Nacho Mama's Apple Pie", you could have "Nacho Mama's Cuppa Tea". (audience laughing) I'll put a little sign on the bottom of the menu that says, "Lost or stolen articles are Nacho Mama's responsibility." (audience laughing) Huh? - Mrs. Harper, we need to move this along. - Well, I'm havin' a good time with these people. I came out here to lighten things up, and I think they're enjoyin' it. (audience cheering) What a wonderful group you are. - That's real nice, Mrs. Harper, but this is "Nacho Show" (laughs). (audience laughing) - Well, excuse the hell outta me. - Mrs. Harper! (audience laughing) - Hang on, I'll get the music. Good God, I can't see a damn thing. (audience laughing) - Well, I guess not. It's darker in there than the night the lights went out in Georgia. (audience cheering) Hold your applause, hold your applause. - Oh, here, I found it (mumbling).

(audience cheering) - I said out. - Y'know, she's just got her panties in a wad, because I was stealin' the show. (audience laughing) (audience cheering) (both exclaiming) - How did that old lady get out here? And who brought that puppet out here? - Don't look at me, my hands are clean. - Spic'n'span. (audience laughing) - Well, that only leaves Robert Anne. I don't know how she did it. Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for this. Robert, I wanna speak to you. - Well, I liked that old lady. I thought she was funny. (audience laughing) (audience cheering) And you know what? I coulda told them about that Sister Mary Annette. You gotta watch out for her. She will creep up on you like a pair of cheap underwear. Y'know? (audience laughing) I bet you been there, huh, Mark? (audience laughing) Anyway, I just wanted to come out here, and tell you all what a thrill it is for me to get to sing in front of all of you wonderful people. Gettin' paid a fortune for havin' a good time. Not havin' to go to some borin' ol' job everyday like y'all. (audience laughing) Well, that came out wrong, but you know what I mean. I'm just, I'm havin' such a good time. I think there's gonna be a real run on Convents when I get through. (audience laughing) Don't get me wrong, I don't get to keep the money or anything like that, but nobody can take away the fun. And the reason I bring this up is because I think that is the most important thing in the world to be happy with what you're doin'. When I had amnesia, I was happy all the time, 'cause I could never remember if I wasn't. (audience laughing) Amnesia can be a good thing. You could hide your own Easter eggs. (Sister Amnesia laughing) (audience laughing) Anyway, when I finally did remember who I was, Reverend Mother let me go back home to visit my family, they're down in Arkansas, and when I saw my mama, and my daddy, and my brother, well, it'd like to have broke my heart. It seems like all they do is work all the time, and they don't seem very happy about it. My mama sells Mary Kay (laughs). (audience laughing) Yeah, she's tryin' to earn that pink Cadillac (laughs). (audience laughing) So far, all she's gots is a little Nativity set (laughs). (audience laughing) It's really cute though, it's all made out of gingerbread. Mama doesn't know it yet, but I ate the little drummer boy. (Sister Amnesia laughing) (audience laughing) Don't laugh, my tummy went "ra-pa-pum-pum" for a week. (audience laughing) Anyway, I think I've gotten way off track, here. What I wanted to do was come out and thank you all for makin' my life so wonderful.

(company gasping) - [Company] Our nurse! (dramatic music) - Sister, you know that Sister Mary Euthanasia's not her real name. They only call her that because once, when she was replacing a blown out fuse, she accidentally turned off the power to the Intensive Care Unit. (audience laughing) - Well, in spite of that little mishap, she has been very instrumental in helping Sister Mary Paul recover from her amnesia. - And that's why Reverend Mother asked our own superintendent of nursing, Sister Mary Wilhelm here, to bring a bit of pageantry to our Jamboree in the form of a tribute to nurses everywhere. And if I may say so myself, you have created quite a spectacle. - (laughs) Well, thank you, and if there are any nurses out there in our audience tonight, we hope you will be especially honored by our salute to the Patron Saint of nursing, Saint Catherine Laboure.

Plus, she still had to pay for the burials. - You did know that our cook, Sister Julia, Child of God, accidentally poisoned 52 of our Sisters, didn't you? (audience laughing) - Wait, that's it! - [Company] What? - Hey, we've handled more kick-offs than the Tennessee Volunteers, huh? (audience laughing) (Sister Robert Anne laughing) (audience applauding) You remember when we had the thank you program and I had the idea that we could raise some extra cash by doing a little funereal work on the side? - Right, and Reverend Mother said, "No way." - Oh, I know, I know, but since then, I've been reworkin' my idea. You know what I'm talkin' about, right guys? - What is it that everyone's in on except me? - You know that little cemetery across from the Convent? - Yes. - And you know how hard it is to park around there, huh? - Yes. - The plan is to pave over the cemetery, and make each headstone a parking space. (audience laughing) This way, you could just drive in. (audience laughing) - We had a drive-in funeral parlor back at home, down in Little Rock. You'd drive up to this big ol' picture of a preacher, and he was holdin' a Bible, only it wasn't really a Bible, you know, it was a speaker like they got at the Burger King, (audience laughing) and you would tell 'em who you were there to see, and then you would drive on ahead, and they would bring the body right up to the window. (audience laughing) Sittin' up. (audience laughing) - Amnesia, that's terrible. - Oh, I'll say. The day we went to visit my dead cousin Arlene we had to wait in line an hour before we got up to the window. It was so hot that day, you could roast a weenie on the dashboard.

And all I can say is, Robert, that is the dumbest idea I've heard since Sister Julia Child of God put Tums in the tacos so we wouldn't get heart burn. (audience laughing) - All right, we hear you. - Now, I need to speak to Sister Mary Paul, and will you please turn off the darn speaker. - Sister Amnesia! - Yeah? - [Sister Wilhelm] Reverend Mother needs to speak to you. - I'll be right there. - All right. Ladies and gentlemen, once again, what's left of the Trott Family Singers. - Listen, I wanna ask y'all something. Have y'all ever been to a reunion? Like a high school reunion? College reunion? - [Father Virgil] Anybody? (audience applauding) - Grade school? Were y'all shocked at how everybody turned out? (audience laughing) - See, we're just curious, 'cause a few weeks back, I took Ronnie Joe to my reunion in Mississippi. We could not believe our eyes. Hey, you shoulda seen her old boyfriend. Clovis T. Beaner. (audience laughing) Hey, imagine you windin' up with ol' Clovis T. Beaner. You'd be livin' at the Hitch'n'Go Trailer Park. (audience laughing) (Father Virgil laughing) - Well, what about Verla May Hickie? She always had her eye on you. - Well, Verla May was the smartest girl in our school, so. - Yeah, right. (Sister Mary Leo oinking) - Hey, hey, now. She still had her figure when she was head cheerleader for that wrestlin' team. (audience laughing) You're just jealous 'cause she beat you out in that Delta Queen Tease Off contest. - Virgil, don't bring that up. - Oh, it's too late. Now, lemme explain this one to ya, folks. Any of y'all remember the Pillsbury Bake Off contest? (audience murmurs) Yeah, all right, well, in Tupelo, we had what was called the Delta Queen Tease Off contest, and that was the event of the year. See, the girl with the biggest hair, (audience laughing) she got the place of honor on that lead float in the fourth of July parade. (audience laughing) - And I knew there was only one girl I had to beat, and that was Verla May Hickie. - Verla May's whole life revolved around big hair. (audience laughing) She used to live right across the street from us. Every night she would be standin' in her bedroom window in this skimpy little nightie just a-teasin', and a-teasin', and a-teasin'. - What're you talkin' about? You couldn't see her window from our house. - You could if you stood on top of the dresser. (audience laughing) - Virgil. Anyway, I just knew for sure I's gonna be the Delta Queen, because I had teased myself a beehive over 28 inches high. (audience laughing) - Her flamin' red hair looked like a fire hydrant in heat! (audience laughing) - Virgil, I woulda won that contest, too, if Verla May hadn't cheated and put starch in her hair. (audience laughing) She had herself a bubble that measured a perfect 36 side to side. (audience laughing) - Not to mention a perfect 36 top to bottom. (audience laughing) - Anyway, after Verla May won, she told me that she was gonna ask Virgil out for a date, 'cause he had just been named captain of the football team. (audience laughing) It was a small school. (audience laughing) Anyway, I said to her, Verla May, I am so sorry, bless your heart, you didn't know. Virgil has decided to become a priest. Well, that bombshell sure burst her big bubble hair. (audience laughing) To this day, she still calls him Father "What-a-Waste". (audience laughing) - Y'know, when I saw Verla May at that reunion, I sat down, and wrote a song about her. - D'ya like to hear it? I think it's pretty good. (audience applauding) Virgil, you ready? - Oh, I'm just about there, thank y'all. - Here it goes. - One, two, three, four.

Reverend Mother is tryin' to arrange for a sponsor for me to come back down for the ceremony. - [Father Virgil] Oh, that's great! - And speaking of sponsors, the word from the friendly folks at Franciscan Fodder is: ♪ If you live in a home ♪ ♪ Where the buffalo roam ♪ ♪ I hope you know someone who cleans ♪ (audience laughing) And if your barnyard is full of finicky eaters, the Franciscans have news for you.

(audience laughing) - Oh, yeah, yeah, right after we tell her the one about the farmer and the rooster. - The farmer and the rooster? - Yeah, haven't you heard that one? - No. (Sister Robert Anne laughing) - See, there was this farmer, that had a rooster, that just had no interest in hens. So, he goes and gets a special pill from Franciscan Fodder. Soon as that rooster ate that pill, he lit out for the henhouse like a bolt of lightning and when he got there, (Sister Robert Anne shouting) and when he was done with them, he headed for the duck pond, and, (Sister Robert Anne shouting) and when he was done with them, he went for the geese. Well, the first thing the farmer knew, the rooster just fell over. Dead, in the middle of the barnyard. And the buzzards started circling overhead. Was then he realized this pill was just too powerful, so he goes to pick up his poor dead rooster. And has he bends over, the rooster goes, "Shh, (laughs)." (audience laughing) Oh, good Christianss, all of ya, bye! (audience cheering) - And now, ladies and gentlemen, we remember a Grand Ole Opry favorite, as we present, "The Mini Pearls of Wisdom."

The Lord says, "Ask, and it shall be given unto you." Well, you have asked, and we are giving it unto you. Yes, folks, this is the first-- (audience laughing) This is the first, the world's first, Catholic Country Auction! (company cheering) (audience applauding) And I have decided as a committee of one that all the proceeds shall go toward getting Sister Mary Paul to the Country Music Awards. Now then, ladies and gentlemen, look, look at the beautiful array of items we have going up for bid. Topping our display is our eye popping, hand crafted, Santa Lu-Chia Pet. (company exclaiming) (audience laughing) That's right. (audience applauding) That's right, ladies and gentlemen, Saint Lucy has never been so alive. Every day, say the special prayer, and pour on the holy water, which is sold separately, (audience laughing) and Saint Lucy's hair grows one inch. (audience laughing) The Santa Lu-Chia Pet proves that the power of prayer is real! (company exclaiming) That's right, Saint Lucy gives whole new meaning to the term "miracle grow". (pounding gavel) Now then, (audience laughing) what is the first item going up for bids? - Well, Sister, I believe that would be the wishbone from the turkey that was served at the Last Supper. (audience laughing) - I bet you'd like to have that, wouldn't ya? - Ladies and gentlemen, this is a one-of-a-kind relic. Rumor has it that Saint Peter and Saint Thomas went at this sucker for over an hour. (audience laughing) But there's no record as to whoever received the larger piece. Now, by the power of Heaven, and a drop of crazy glue, this bone has been healed. (audience laughing) - [Sister Wilhelm] Hallelujah! - Yeah, that's a miracle! (audience applauding) - Although the crack in it only adds to its authenticity, we have been ordered to sell this holy bone as damaged merchandise. Take it away, Colonel Wilhelm. - All right, now who will begin the bidding at the ridiculously low price of $5? Do I have a $5 bid? - $5! This gentleman right here! - [Sister Wilhelm] I got a $5 bid now. Who can give me 10, $10 bid now? - Sister! - [Sister Wilhelm] Who can give me 20, $20 bid now, that's a 20, I got a $30 bid now down here. $30, I got a $40 bid now, okay, now I need a $50 now, only a $50 bid. - Sister! (pounding gavel) - [Sister Wilhelm] Knick-knack, paddy-whack, give a dog the bone, to the man down there. (audience applauding) (audience cheering) - Congratulations! You, you have made a very wise investment. May all your wishes come true. Here, use this card, here, to claim your merchandise after the program, all right? - I'll just hold your bone for you, 'til the show's over, sir. (audience laughing) - [Sister Robert Anne] What's next, Sister? - Well, I bet you all think you know where the Bible Belt is, right? - [Sister Leo] Do you? - Huh? Let me hear ya. I bet you'd say it's right here, maybe Tennessee, Georgia, right? - [Sister Wilhelm] Tennessee! - Wrong! What would you say if I told you the Bible Belt could be around your waist? (audience laughing) Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, take a look at the next item goin' up for bids. (Sister Wilhelm exclaiming) (audience laughing) - Folks, this is the authentic Bible Belt, designed by a holy person determined a prophet from the word of God! (audience laughing) This belt is adjustable to all sizes, and remember, every time you unzip your fly, you can have the key to the Kingdom standin' by! - Bless us, Lord, yes! (audience cheering) Bring it home! - Speakin' of keys, who will lock this one up with a $10 bid? - [Sister Wilhelm] $10 bid, now do I have a $10 bid? - $10, $10, $10! - Now I need $15, $15 bid. - Here he is! - [Sister Wilhelm] Who'll give me a $20 bid? $20 bid? - Hop up, $20! - Who'll give me $25, 25, keep it on out. Who'll give me a $30 bid, now? All right, I need a $30 bid, now, $30 bid. Oh, I got it, $35, all right, $40 bid, now, 40. Sold, (pounding gavel) to the gentleman right over there, for $40! - $40, oh there you go. You got the last bid in there, congratulations. - 42! (Sister Amnesia laughing) - 42, I'm sorry, sir, the Gates at Heaven have been closed on this particular piece of merchandise. (audience laughing) But thank you very much. (audience applauding) Congratulations, sir, you're the proud owner of a authentic Bible Belt. Now, I feel kinda bad, maybe y'all could share it. Have y'all met? - Yeah, we're brothers. - Oh, my goodness sakes, gentlemen, it's the Raybon Brothers! Right here in the front row! (audience cheering) Well, congratulations then. (audience applauding) That's great. Keep that belt in the family, there. I'll tell you what, though. You might wanna share that, 'cause whoever's got that belt on will never be caught with their pants down, that's a good thing, remember that. Congratulations, what's next there, Sister? - Hey, hey, you two. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, we have somethin' very special now. You all are gonna be bidding for the opportunity to come up here on stage and have a picture taken with all of us commemorating this most special evening. This is a once in a life time opportunity, ladies and gentlemen, do I hear $50? - [Sister Robert Anne] 50 cents! - Who'll give me a $2 bid, now? $2 bid, now, right over there, now. Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen, let's hold it, hold it. Let us separate the men from the boys. Who will take a flyin' leap with me to a $5 bid now?

(audience applauding) Oh, boy. - I hadn't been to a good ol' country auction since we left Mississippi. - Oh, yes? - Yeah, we never had any country auctions back home in Brooklyn. - Whoa. You musta missed out on a lot of good stuff growin' up in Brooklyn. - Well, I wouldn't say I missed out. It was just different, y'know?

Rollin', rollin'? Rollin' with what? - Oh, oh, I could do a modern dance! - Yeah! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no thank you, no thank you, darlin'. Not after that modern dance you took me and Granny to, no. - What happened? - Well, she took me and Granny to this, "interpretive ballet". We sat down and this girl comes a runnin' out on the stage, and she yells, "I'm runnin'." (audience laughing) And another girl jumps out and says, "I'm jumpin'." (audience laughing) Then a third girl hops out and says, "I'm hoppin'." Well, Granny stood up, and said, "I'm leavin'." (audience laughing) - All right, all right, no modern dance. - Thank you, very much. - Hey, hey, hey! How about our salute to Patsy Cline? - [Father Virgil] Now that's a good idea, I like that. - Father Carusone, can you get out that Patsy Cline tune we wrote? - Yeah, I don't know about you all, but we are very big fans of Patsy Cline. - Oh, yeah. (audience cheering) I think she's Reverend Mother's favorite singer. - Yes, and that's why she asked us to put this tribute together. So what we did, we took 43 Patsy Cline song title hits, and we strung 'em all together into one brand new song. - Now, we could really use your help with the chorus.
