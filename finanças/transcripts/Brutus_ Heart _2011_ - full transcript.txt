It's tomorrow. I can make it. My night shift ends today. Great. It's the last meeting. So I'm glad you could come. - OK. - Bye, and good luck. Thanks. Diana? Must be my imagination. Victoria. You again. It's this. OK, OK. I'll remove it for you. Brutus's Heart Subbed by Shioki. May 10, 2011. I know you can do it. - Thank you very much. - Congratulations. That was Hashimoto, winner of the Innovation Award. I will continue working hard for the future of MM Heavy Industry. Thank you very much. And, the President Award goes to the developer of the Robot OS for Brutus. Suenaga Takuya from R&D, Department of Robot. {\a6}Secretary to CEO - Amemiya Yasuko {\a6}Planning Manager - Nishina Naoki You're late. {\a6}Nishina's daughter - Nishina Hoshiko I'm the man of revolution, Suenaga. With the OS I developed, MM Heavy Industry has jumped to the top of the World of Robotics. But my goal isn't this small. In the near future, I want Japan's robots... all the robots in the world, to be loaded with this OS. Before long, the commercial robot loaded with this OS, Brutus will be completed. Please look forward to it. Promising young man. {\a6}MM Heavy Industry CEO - Nishna Toshiki. I have high hopes on the Robot Division. Planning Manager. You will be responsible for it. {\a6}Factory Worker - Sakai Goro - Emi. - Goro. You came. {\a6}MM Heavy Industry, Planning Office - Nakamori Emi. My boss called me over. I feel so out of place. Not at all. Please stand closer. Naoki, Hoshino. Come here. OK. Say cheese. Daddy. Why do I need to come to the company party? What's so bad about this. Just enjoy yourself. Suenaga. Please accompany Hoshiko. - I understand. - Send her back later. One more. CEO. It's time soon. OK. Naoki. Come. - I'll leave my precious sister with you. - OK. - Want a drink? - No. - You don't drink? - Like I can enjoy myself here. You're right. Let's go. Hey. Let go. My Daddy said so, but I don't plan to. - Really? - I'm sure you know why Daddy called me over. Yes. But who cares about that. - What? - Because of that you refused to go out with me. I think it's a waste. I liked it. Brutus. The plan is going well. Together, we will rise to the top of this company. Equal human rights is just a dream. Right now, I'm still a being-order-around worker. But in no time, I will become a ruler. I just need more power. And I can get it soon. "Amemiya Yasuko" - You're joking. - I'm not. What're you gonna do? Of course I'm carrying it. - Is it mine? - What? Answer me. I know you have other men. So you knew. You're carrying it without knowing who the father is? - I'll know after it's born. - What do you want? Guess. I'm not gonna marry you. I don't need you to. Then, money? Abort it. If I don't? You gonna kill me? You're in luck. Is it Hoshiko? Hello. Yes. Yes. At home. Ah. Yes. I'm coming now. OK. Hey. How far have you gone with Hoshiko? Why do you ask? - Are you serious about her? - Of course. I'm gonna make her mine, and marry her. - So don't hinder me. - I won't. Once you become part of the Nishina's, the child fee will be nothing to you. - Yasuko. - Yes? Don't overdo it. You want to marry me? You sure are frank. Don't switch the topic. Yes, I do. I don't intend to marry because of the company. - I know. - Even so, you want to marry me? Yes. I also don't intend to marry for others. - Who is it? - Nothing important. Hey. Come shopping with me. - Daddy's birthday's in a few days. - Sure. - What should I give him? - Let me think. Mr Suenaga. You have a phone extension from the Planning Office. OK. I'm coming in. What a rare gathering. Take a seat. Excuse me. I'll get straight to the point. I gathered you guys because of Amemiya Yasuko. Surprised? When I found out about you guys, I was shocked too. Us too... You were one too? That's right. What the hell is she thinking. She really played the people near her hard. You guys heard about the baby, right? Yes. So, what do you plan to do? You want to find out who the father is? I can't say for sure that it isn't mine. If she wants to extort an exorbitant child fee from me, my place in this company won't be stable anymore. How about you guys? Suenaga. How are you progressing with Hoshiko? - That is... - Even if the child isn't yours, if your relationship with Yasuko gets out, you'll be in trouble. The CEO will definitely break you guys up. You're right. How about you? I have a family. My wife and 2 kids. Then, what do you plan to do? Yasuko doesn't plan to abort, nor get married. That...That is... If we don't make the first move, the situation will get out of hand. "If only she's dead." Don't you guys think so? I have a plan. It will only work if we cooperate. You guys need time to think, don't you? I'll book a room in 2 days. We'll meet there. You have a day to consider. I don't need a guy. So, have you decided? Great. Pick one. What is this? - Has the plan started already? - Not yet. This is just a way to test your resolution. Just pick one. For yes, put joker. Otherwise, put the other card. If both put joker, the plan will be carried out. If someone objects, the plan will be called off. I see. I got it. And now, the time has come. The worst outcome. To Amemiya Yasuko. What's his plan? We're doing a relay. Baton is the corpse. May 19, 10pm. Nagoya. Yasuko will be killed in Osaka. But the body will be found in Tokyo. We're moving the body. A, B, C refers to us. On that day, A will be in Osaka. B in Nagoya. C in Atsugi. A will kill Yasuko at 6.30pm. A will create a perfect alibi before 6.30pm, load the body onto the car, and head to Nagoya. Then, he'll get off the car near Nagoya station, and take the bullet train back to Osaka. He will be done latest by 11pm. A will try to meet up with others. and limit the alibi-less timing from 6 to 11 pm. Next is B. B will create an alibi before 10pm. He will then get on the car abandoned by A. And head towards Atsugi. May 20, 1.30am. Tomei Highway. Don't scare me. He should reach by 2am. Get off the highway, and head to the prearranged location. - C will be waiting there. - How do C get there? I will arrange a car. He will be moving the body with that. C will head to Tokyo, while B will return to Nagoya. Isn't that hard on B? He needs to drive for over 8 hours. No. Isn't that the best job? A does the killing. C disposes of the body. In this case, the estimated time of death will probably be from 5pm to 8pm. In that case, we'll need an alibi for these timings. B and C have one. Yes. But what will A do? A will be in Osaka, but the body is found in Tokyo. Unless as our plan is leaked, A will never be suspected. In other words, we all have an alibi. - I see. I see. - I have a question. After A killed, there's no way to ensure B and C won't turn their backs. Even if A got arrested, B and C can push all the blame over to A. Indeed. Then, let's do this. "We collaborated to kill Amemiya Yasuko" We will put our names and thumbprints here. And A will keep it. I see. A joint agreement. Then, who is A? Will you be deciding that? This matter has nothing to do with work. Let's decide this fairly. 1 is A, 2 is B, 3 is C. Fine? - Fine. - Yes. Before that, can I check the cards? I assume you accepted it. Let's start from the youngest. Then, I'll go first. I'll pick this. Open at the same time. 3. 2. 1. It's me. May 20, 2.10am. Atsugi. Toyonaka Sawmill. What a place to pick. This belongs to Manager's relative, in Toyohashi. Hurry up. Did you peek inside? Why would I? It's gross. Wait. Hold on. Hurry and carry it over. Try not to shift the position too much. A dead human always weighs more. I can't dispose of something so heavy. - Please. Help me. - Don't complain now. I still need to return to Nagoya. You only need to be back by morning. There's time. - I asked for a wakeup call at 7. - There's time! - What if there isn't? - Nothing much. They'll probably just find it weird. That might become an important testimony. A change in the plan might be fatal. Lucky you. You only need to move the body. Help me push the body further in. I need to close the car. If it's too in, getting it out will be hard work. That's not Yasuko. What should we do? What to do? We got to take a peek. What the hell?! The perfect murder which fell apart early! Who on earth killed the Manager? Don't come in. Don't come in. You can't go in. Cameras are forbidden. You can't take photos. I said you can't. Please don't go in. Don't push. Don't push. - Mr Suenaga. Have you heard, about Manager? - No. Not the details. I heard his body was found at the carpark in his apartment. The police came, and the planning office is in a mess. I see. Sorry for disturbing. - We just need a bit of your time. - OK. This is getting big. Don't scare me. You don't need to look so shocked. What happened to Manager? Who knows. Yasuko went to Osaka yesterday, didn't she? Manager must have invited her over. The plan was going well then. So Yasuko is the killer? That's highly possible. Did you find the joint agreement? I searched everywhere in his house, but it's nowhere. If Yasuko is holding onto it, she would know we are his accomplices. - Then, we're in deep shit. - What will she do? Hello? OK. I got it. Tell them I'll be right there. - The police wants to question me. - Police? They will look for you too. Our alibi is perfect. - Don't crap, and nothing will go wrong. - I know. - I'm Sayama from MPD. - I'm Shindou. - You are Suenaga Takuya? - I am. - Sorry for disturbing you. - Not a problem. - I'm glad to be of help. - Take a seat. I'll be direct. I've heard that you're the groom-to-be of Ms Nishina Hoshiko? That's just a rumor. In fact, I'm just one of her playmate. But didn't Mr Nishina Naoki say anything to you? Regarding your relationship with Ms Nishina. I wonder. Because of this, you see Mr Nishina Naoki as an obstacle. That's not true. Because I don't see myself as a groom-to-be. Then, could you tell us what you did yesterday in details? Sure. I was on a business trip to Nagoya in the morning. And was with the people from Nachi Machinery. I was there until evening. I checked into the hotel at 10. The hotel is Nagoya Century Hotel. - So you rested after that? - Yes. After organizing my documents, I went to sleep. Excuse me. - To Nagoya. - OK. When did you check out? At 9. I received a wakeup call at 7. After getting my breakfast, I went to Nachi Machinery to finish up my work. Then I got onto the bullet train at 11.30, and reached my office before 2. - Do you need me to repeat? - No thanks. Nishina Naoki's business trip was planned one week ago. But Suenaga Takuya has an alibi. - Isn't this, a mere coincidence? - I wonder. Transporting the corpse to Tokyo just sounds weird. - Why would they do that? - Don't talk about that during dinner. Eh? You don't like people talking about these during meals? Stupid. You're too loud. You're rather slow. - Our job revolves around people. - Sorry. Many youngsters these days are KY (don't know how to read body languages). The word KY is no longer in. I really want to pour my soup on you. "Nishina Naoki's funeral" Ms Yamamori. - Must be hard on you recently. - Not at all. What did the police ask you? A lot, like Manager's business trip. - Do you have any idea who the killer is? - No idea. Manager is a gentleman. I can't think of anyone who hates him. I see. Thanks. Goodbye. - Goro. - You fine? Why are you in a daze? - You don't need to stay there? - It's fine. There's no need to bother myself with him. You should. He's the eldest son of the Nishina's after all. Nishina? I don't see him as one. - What? - We don't share the same mother. He was born to my father in his previous marriage. - They divorced? - Yes. They said they don't need Daddy's help and moved out. His mother then died in a traffic accident. And he returned nonchalantly. He's the only son after all. That's why Daddy favors him. He's not even capable. But didn't he return? - He's out for revenge. - Revenge? He wants to seize the Nishina's wealth and company and destroy them. - What terrible imagination. - It's not my imagination. His mother family was our company's client. That's why they went bankrupt after the divorce. That's why he bear a grudge. You don't have a family. Yes. My mother died when I was young. And my father died when I was in university. How nice. Nothing to tie you down. I'm sure you're now thinking I'm blessed but don't appreciate it. Maybe you're right. How? Did Yasuko say anything? She went to Osaka that day. But she didn't meet him. She could be lying. - That's weird. - You think she did it? It's only natural to suspect her. You're right. No matter what, we got to act fast. Regarding that... Is there no other way out? Other then murder? What do you suggest? Like, you can marry Yasuko. You want to ruin my future? In the first place, she doesn't want that. This is murder! Let's call it off! - I have a family... - Fuck you. We can't back off now. You will never betray me. Fools should just shut up, and listen to me. Takuya! Mom! Please stop. Please. Stop. - I'm lonely. - St...Stop! - Shut up. - Stop it! Please. Stop. - I'm lonely. - Sto... - Shut up. - Please! - No! - Ouch! Auntie! Damn! Dad. You don't have work? - Shut up! - Stop! Is that how you look at your father?! Brat. Damn you! What the hell! Bastard. Fuck. I can't let this stop me. - Yes? - Mr Suenaga. A package for you. Please sign here. According to report from the Tokyo Prosecutor's office, the former Head of a major contractor company, KLP Construction, Aida Susumu, and a former employee of an associate company, Ueno Masahiro, are suspected to be involved in this case. They were dealing with ODA this feburary... What a luxurious return for obituary gift. How old-fashioned. Next. Yesterday, an employee of MM Heavy Industry, Hashimoto Atsushi was found dead at home. He died from hydrocyanic gas poisoning. The potassium cyanide was found in a fountain pen. A fountain pen works by absorbing ink, and the chemical was found in the filler. Hashimoto was using the pen. As he was using the filler, potassium cyanide reacted with the acid in blue ink, and hydrocyanide gas was released. The fountain pen was sent as an acknowledgment for obituary gift for Nishina Naoki who was killed a few days ago, also from the same company. But the Nishina's have yet to send out any return gifts. So, the police suspects this case is related with Nishina's death, and are investigating. That woman. Do you have any words for the bereaved family? How do you feel right now? I've heard that the two who died were in conflict with each other. Can we have a word from you? CEO. - What is happening? - I've heard from the reporter that on the day Naoki was murdered, Hashimoto borrowed a car from a friend. He drove the car from Tokyo to Atsugi along the Tomei Highway. Then he drove to Tomei Kawazaki from Atsugi. Why did he return to Kawazaki? To get to Naoki's house, the fastest way is to get off at Tomei Kawazaki. Furthermore, evidences have shown that Naoki has ridden in that car before. - So he's the murderer? - No. Hashimoto has an alibi, so he's just moving the body. Police suspect that Naoki was murdered in Osaka, and his body was brought to Atsugi. Anyway, I don't want our company's name to be damaged from this. - Munekata. I'll leave this to you. - Understood. Serial murderer? Our factory stocks up on potassium cyanide. Which means the murderer is an insider? - Hey. Look at this. - I've heard. Words spread fast. - It already spread? - Yes. - Hello. - I'm Amemiya from the CEO Office. He's calling you. Please come over ASAP. - I'm Suenaga. - Come in. Excuse me. - Seat. - No thanks. I have no other reason to call you here. Do you have any clue on what happened to Naoki and Hashimoto? No. Not at all. Why do you ask? It's simple. Munekata said only you have a clear motive to kill them. Naoki doesn't seem to approve of you and Hoshiko. And Hashimoto is your only rival in the company. He also mentioned that you won't do anything to draw suspicions to yourself. But, it's also possible that you made a mistake. Can you prove your innocence? Yes. On the day Manager was murdered, I was on a business trip to Nagoya. I told the police the same thing. They haven't looked for me after that. Doesn't this mean my alibi has been proven? I see. I'm not suspecting you. I just want the objective truth. - Excuse me. - Come in. Thanks. - That's all. Please have a drink. -Thanks. - Please don't feel bad. - I'm not. That's great. I'm not clear about the workings of your department. Are you saying that because Manager and Hashimoto belongs to my department, that's why they was murdered? I hope that's not true. If it's related to work, that will be bad. I also belong to the same department. The next one could be me. I see. It'll be a great loss if that happens. So be careful. See you. By the way, can you prove your alibi? Of course. I left for Yokosuka that day. And visited the Nishina's at night. While the murderer was moving the body, I was enjoying a glass of wine with the CEO. It's me. What the hell? "We collaborated to kill Amemiya Yasuko" "I'll be waiting on the factory rooftop." A copy. Damn. Nakamori. Can I have a word? - So Manager's private life is a mystery. - Yes. - Has he invited you before? - No. Have you heard about him with other woman? Like when someone called him, or someone... Why are you asking all these? - Does this has anything to do with his death? - You don't need to know. Emi. Goro. He's my childhood friend. He's working in the experiment department.. - I'm Sakai. - You guys are dating? What? - We're not. - I see. This is none of your business. I think you guys looks compatible. If you remember anything, call me. What was that? He feels like someone from a different world. 2 people died. Ya. Both of them are potential fathers of your child. When did you find out? - What do you want? - What? There's no love in the first place, right? What? Because you mentioned love. You go around grabbing men who can give you money? You're the same too. I caught you with little effort. What's wrong with marrying Manager? You'll get a much more considerable amount than the child fee. I told you I don't want to marry. You don't need marriage nor love. Aren't you similar? We're of the same kind. We don't see happiness in love or family. Right? What's happiness to you? Let me see. Maybe it's to live together with this child under the sun. What the. You think you can achieve that like this? It's better without the father. I don't need a man. "Investigation Report on Death of Worker, Takashima Yuji with regards to the Robot, DIANA" What is this doing here? "Investigation on MM Heavy Industry. Illegal overworking leads to operational mistake." What? What do you think? It ended long ago. It's also written here. It was Yuji's operational mistake. But I can't accept this. And why is Manager holding onto this? Is there something we don't know? You think too much. More importantly... I'll carry out my own investigation. Until I can understand everything. Only then, will I be able to think about the future. "Female Employee took potassium cyanide and suicided." - Woman are scary. - What? I heard she killed Manager Nishina and Hashimoto. - Is it true? - I've heard too. But it's a rumor. Our stock prices are falling. I hope this can stop. All this in spite of your Brutus giving us an image boost. Mr Suenaga. Call from the factory. Line 2. - Which robot is faulty? - This. It will assemble the product even if it's defective. Then it's not the robot's fault. You got to control the production steps. No. That is done manually. As long as it's done manually, defects will occur. Pushing the blames to robot is not the right way. Oh ya. Someone from the office called yesterday, and enquired about the names of the robots you handled before. What a strange enquiry. Where is it from? Said person was arranging technical reports. It was a woman voice. Wait. I have a question. You're checking up on me. Why? - I'm in a hurry. - What are you looking for? I don't like people doing that. - Let go. - Tell me, and I'll let go. Say. Why are you checking up on me? Before Manager died, he met up with you and Hashimoto, right? And both of them died. You find it fishy that I'm the only one alive, right? What a joke. And so, treat me as a murderer? What else do you know? The police came again, didn't they? Did they find out anything? Diana? Why do you have this? Why are you checking this suddenly? I was going to marry Takashima Yuji. Takashima? You probably forogt. He was killed by this robot. If that didn't happen, I'll be together with Yuji... Yuji was killed by you guys. Huh? What are you saying? It was due to his operational mistake. What...He wouldn't commit such mistake. Isn't there also the possibility of program bug or malfunction? No. That's impossible. It's 99.9999% safe. The program was tested and proven. It's probably lower than the probability of you striking the lottery or resigning. He always said that the elites prioritizes the robots over the humans. To them, workers are consumables. - You're not denying it? - It's true. Objectively speaking, that's the truth. Anyway, just stop checking up on me. I have nothing to do with that accident! Why does she have this? What happened 2 years ago? Everyone please gather. The police have something to say regarding the case. Sorry to take up your time. We would like to obtain some information. It's regarding Nishina Naoki's death. His house has been messed up by someone. - Messed up? - What is happening? On the ashtray in the room, we found ashes of burnt paper. A, B, and C are written on it. A scientific analysis, revealed 3 readable words. 2 of them are Kanji. One is "Ya", meaning house. The second one is "Ko", meaning children. The last word is also an alphabet. D. That's it. If anyone has any idea on what they mean,please come forward. Does that mean that an employee here - is involved in the murder? - You're right. We are just checking out every possibility. Please cooperate, so that the case can be solved ASAP. D? You're next - D Accomplices in the murder relay are murdered one after another! Who on earth is 'D'? Is there something wrong with my alibi? No. We're not here for that. We are here with some questions for you. - I see. - Where were you on the night of 31th? That's last Tuesday. - 31th? On the day Amemiya died? - Yes, you're right. I went home right after work, - and went to the bouldering gym. - Bouldering? It's something like mountain climbing. It's indoor. Oh. So your hobby is mountain climbing? No. I wanted to try the real thing, but couldn't find time to. I'm already drained out at the gym. Ah. No wonder you're MM Heavy Industry young star. - You're pretty motivated. - Not at all. I got the stamp on my member's card that day. - Here. - Thank you. 31th, 21.05pm. So you were at the gym then? Yes. Can this become my alibi? Don't get it wrong. You don't become a suspect because you don't have an alibi. Please excuse us for asking such questions. Mr Suenaga. Can we ask you another question? - What is it? - What is your blood type? - My blood type? - Actually, Ms Amemiya is pregnant. What? Is that so? That is... We have no idea who the father is. So we checked through Ms Amemiya's call history, and found out that she contacted you at regular intervals. I admit it, but I think this problem can easily be solved by a DNA test. We haven't proven it's connection with the case, so we can't run a DNA test on everyone involved. Isn't the father Hashimoto or Manager Nishina? No, they're not. Can you tell us your blood type? - O. - O? You sure? You can confirm it with the company medical centre. Ms Amemiya is O. Both Mr Hashimoto and Mr Nishina are A. What do you think the child is. - It was B. - B? Yes. In other words, the father is either B or AB. Who exactly is the father? I have no idea. If you remember anything, please contact us. Sorry for disturbing you at this hour. The father is D? It's for your own good if you stopped probing around. I warn you. Mind your own business. I'm only saying this once. And no more. - If I refuse, you're going to kill me? - Don't say such scary words. Why can't I investigate? My pride as a technician won't allow me to give up halfway. A technician's pride. What an empty word. - Why? -I think I should tell you. What? The problem lies in Diana during that accident. - Really? - We have a witness stepping up after the accident. He changed shift with the deceased worker to patrol the robots. According to him, 12 hours before the accident, the same thing happened. But, why wasn't that made public? He told Manager Nishina about it. Which means he is aware of the truth? Yes. And he consulted the CEO about it. The CEO takes pride in our robots. So he can't allow the truth to come to light. And ordered the truth to be covered up. That's all. Please use your pride on the next research. We had enough with that accident. My OS is perfect. I hope you don't get defeated by your confidence. Can I ask you something? What is it? Didn't you benefited from Manager's death? What do you mean? Aren't you the next successor to CEO? That is up to the CEO to decide. Investigations on the Murder Relay. Takuya is chasing after D! Thanks for your help yesterday. What business do you have today? We met a lady who went to a musical together with Ms Amemiya. Then? I find it hard to understand. The lady said that Ms Amemiya doesn't look like she's going to kill herself. What's unexpected is that she went to a musical before committing suicide. What about the child? Did you find out who the father is? No, not yet. This is troubling. Maybe she's the kind who plays around outside? - Well, I quite pity her. - Pity? Her father was a teacher in a High School. And he made a girl outside pregnant. Because he's a teacher, the girl forced him to pay an exorbitant child fee. And her family was ruined. We're of the same kind. We don't see happiness in love or family. - Her father... - Oh ya. Do you recognize this? No. Is this Amemiya's? Looks like a pretty expensive accessory. Which means, the guy who gifted that to her, is the father? We're still in the midst of investigation. Have you made any progress with other cases? No. Not at all. But we found something new. It's regarding Nishina Naoki's death. We suspect there's an accomplice. So there's 2 murderer? No. It's not 1 or 2 person involved. I speculated that 3 people might be involved in it. How? Interesting? It is. I look forward to hearing the details. Not a problem. You look tired. I'm not. Really? That's good. - You got to return soon. - Why? If you stayed out all night, the CEO will scold me. Don't worry. He won't say anything if it's you. - Is it clear? - Yes. The child is a B. B. In other words, the child is likely to be mine. It was your child. I lost 2 child because of this case. You plan to take the child in? She should be carrying a boy. Even if it's a girl, I will also compensate her. The police didn't found my trace while checking Yasuko, right? That's not a problem right now. But there was something bad. It was the brooch you bought in France. I see. I'll leave that up to you. - How's Naoki's case getting along? - The police found that another car from Toyonaka Sawmill, was used to move the body. - What?! - Which means Naoki isn't merely a victim. That's terrible. If someone from Nishina's is found to be involved in murder, the reputation of MM Heavy Industry and the Nishina's will go down to drain. - The police also made another discovery. - Again?! The person who drove the car is likely to be Suenaga. Too bad. Get rid of him. Erase everything linking him and Hoshiko. Understood. Back at square one again. - Time to think about my next successor. - Yes. - You don't have a child yet? - Not yet. I can only trust those my blood relations best. Yes. He's entering Junior High this year. Good looking, right? Prepare for adoption. - You're putting too much. - But this is delicious. If you don't believe, you can try it too. - Too much and the meat will lose it's taste. - No. The meat will taste better. What's wrong? Creating an overly perfect alibi to conceal a crime, will make him stand out more. Which means, the alibi is fake? What was Suenaga's alibi on the day Nishina Naoki was murdered? He has an alibi from 10pm till 7am the next day. In this time, he can move the body. Probably took a taxi. - Morning of May 20. Are you sure? - Yes. I remembered it clearly. I drove him from Toyohashi Station all the way to Nagoya. Do you remember what he look like? Well, I'm not really sure. Tell us if you recognize him. None of them seems right. But he looks like him. - This guy? - Ah. I'm not really sure though. Does he has any peculiarity? Peculiarity? Hmm... - Ah, I just remembered. - What? A scar, around here. He also had a scar on his right ear. I caught a glimpse of it as he was getting off. "Ah! That's the opposite of mine." And that's why I remembered it well. Right ear. - We're returning to Tokyo. - OK. I knew it. He's involved in the murders. What do you want to talk about? - You were in charge of Diana's program, right? - Yes. Were you called to the planning office after the accident? Planning office? No. I see. Oh ya. Long after the accident, Manager Nishina came by. - What did he ask? - He wanted to know if it is possible to trace a scenario where the robot's operation was temporarily stopped, and operated manually. - Manually? - It was troublesome. Everyone was scared after that. What's that guy name again? The guy who work in the shift before Takashima. - What's wrong with him? - He was transferred. I had to teach the new guy right from the start. I see. - Is there anything wrong with that accident? - No, nothing. Thanks. I found it. I've waited long. I also have something to tell you. What do you have to say? I want to find out the truth. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'll start from your first crime. You murdered Takashima Yuji, Nakamori Emi's fiance. Right? "I'm sorry, Emi." "I have something I must tell you." Good day. You're early. Ya. I have some good news for you. What is it? I finally got transferred out. Sorry. For getting out of this hellish job before you. I see. I've also applied for transfer. Do you have a girlfriend? Why so sudden? Nothing. I'm gonna marry soon. That's probably why my wish to transfer came true. You're marrying Emi? Of course. Who else can it be? You killed him, because you couldn't get Emi? Not only did Yuji get Emi, he also attained a normal life. And I got nothing at all. And you hated him because of that? You won't understand. Working night shifts every night. Having no one to speak to. Looking at robots everyday. I felt like I'm becoming a machine. I was at my limits. Wow. I just came to take a look at the night operations. Stop that buzzer first. He died because the robot malfunctioned. Just testify that the same thing happened in the morning. Get it? Why do you think he told you that? He wasn't covering up for you. He wanted to destroy MM Heavy Industry. Seems like he really hated here. In order to inflict damage, a robot malfunctioning would be more effective than human error. But the CEO hushed up his report. And it became Takashima Yuji's operational mistake. And in order not to be reported to the police, you became Manager's dog. He must have ordered you around frequently. No. Only once. To kill Amemuya Yasuko, right? May 19, 5.30pm. Shin Osaka. He ordered me to abandon the Toyonaka's van at the carpark in Shin Osaka Station, and head to the coffee lounge in the basement to meet Amemiya Yasuko. I was to pretend to be his man, and get her in the van, kill her when no one is around, and abandon the car at the vacant land near Nagoya Station. That was his order. But, after seeing Amemiya, I changed my mind. If I listened to him, I will be ordered around by him forever, like a robot. Since I'm gonna kill someone, I chose to kill him. So you drove the van to the location indicated on the map. You were the one who sent the potassium cyanide, and pushed me off the rooftop? You misunderstood that Hashimoto and I knew about your secret. We had no idea of your existence. If you hadn't misunderstood and killed Hashimoto, he won't even get suspected. That's why you can never make it big. What! I'm different from you. What a rare present from you. - You didn't poison it, did you? - Stupid. This bakery's great. If you don't eat, I will. Wow. It's delicious. Told you so. Who told you to hinder me. I'm different from the likes of you. If you don't exist, Yasuko might even be able to walk under the sun. It was your potassium cyanide that killed Yasuko. How many people have you killed? Takashima Yuji's death was written off as an accident. You can simply disregard Manager's order. I can't. As long as he's alive, I'm just like a robot, following his every orders. If only you were cleverer. You looked compatible with her though. - Too bad. - What! Did you hug her with your filthy hands? You sure are easy to agitate. That's why you can't accomplish anything. What is so different between us? I'm a ruler. Even if you become CEO, you can't rule anything! - Huh? - Because we are not robots. You're right. Robots are much more superior. You guys can't even follow orders from the elites faithfully. What an arrogant guy. We won't be controlled by power. You're just unwilling to admit defeat. Do you know who's the father of Amemiya Yasuko's child? Huh? Amemiya has another guy. Who? So you have no idea. You're just a pawn in this. Tell me. Who is it? The CEO. Manager was shocked too. To think that he slept with the same woman with the father he hated. That's why he killed Yasuko? Goro? Goro?! Goro? Goro? Goro?! Sorry... Goro? I sympathize with you. I think you're worst off. What? - Believing only in power. - Huh? You also got betrayed by the man you trust. Human will betray you. - That's not true. - You wouldn't understand. You're scared, aren't you? To believe and then get betrayed. You don't know what's it's like to trust. Poor thing. Shut up. Stop it... I can't breathe... Mom... This can't be. When? When did my plan start to fail? A dream. I must be dreaming. This can't be. When did it fail? I should be able to see the future. There should be one. This can't be. There should be a future. This can't be. I... What the hell? Brutus. Goro? Goro? Emi, sorry. Goro?! Goro?! Goro?! Brutus. - Takuya. - Mom.
