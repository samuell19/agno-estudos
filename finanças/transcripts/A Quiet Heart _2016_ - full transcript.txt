WEB-DL / WEBRip / WEB Duration: 1:34:00 FPS: 24 I don't know what I said or didn't say, I'm the owner and I'm telling you, 3000 is the minimum. I don't understand. I just... don't understand. Okay. I'm sorry, Igor. I won't be taking the apartment. -Why? I heard what you said to that lady and I can't pay more than her. Who cares about her? People like her are like nails without a head. Give me 2,800. You won't find cheaper apartments than this in Jerusalem. Where do you live now? -Tel Aviv. With the boyfriend? No. With my parents. Can I ask you about the piano? It belonged to my late aunt. It's broken, worthless. Would you mind... if I left it here? Just for a day or two. 2600. For you. On the phone you said it's available immediately? Welcome to Jerusalem. Schumann. Come here. What is it? Sasha's bowl is beneath you? Maybe Sasha's a dog? Fine. "Dad" Simcha, your cocoa's getting cold. Mom, the car's in your name. Could you please transfer ownership? You never use it. Naomi, get in the car and come home. Dad and I are climbing the walls. Well, I can't pay 100 shekel fines every day. What fines? I couldn't sleep last night. I want you to see someone, Naomi, before you do something really stupid. Okay, Mom, I'll talk to you later. -But you never answer my calls! Can't I know where my daughter's living? Is the neighborhood okay? Do you have bars on the windows? A steel door? -Bye, Mom. Talk to you later. Tell me the truth, Naomi, is all this madness because of David? Because of David? He's out of the country, I haven't spoken to him in 8 months. So what is going on with you? Jerusalem, of all places? Where to? "The Voice of Music". What's the purpose of your visit? -I have a meeting with Mrs. Marx. You'll come all the way from Tel Aviv every day? -No, I moved to Jerusalem. Really? Young people usually make the opposite move. Where do you live? On Brazil st. You know it? Kiryat Yovel? What do your parents think? A talent like yours mustn't be wasted. It's a crime. It's just wrong. I don't know anyone else who can give me a job, so... thank you so much for helping me, Gabriella. Well, Good luck. -Thank you. "Mom" Are you replacing Gombrovich? Excuse me? -Hi, I'm Maya, from "Kiryat Yovel, Non Religious". We're a group of students trying to stop the ultra-Orthodox from taking over the neighborhood. Hi, I'm Naomi. Nice to meet you. This is an invitation to an activist meeting. It's important you attend. You can read about our cause. I don't mean to alarm you, this is not Meah Shearim, but there's a war going on. If anyone gives you a look, or says something fishy, anything, you can call this hotline number. You're not alone. Thank you. And do whatever you like, clothes, men, music on Shabbat... this isn't the ghetto yet. Thank you. Do you know what happened to the lady who lived here before you? She passed away. She didn't pass away? Forget it, I don't want to freak you out. Give me your cellphone. You can call me anytime. Okay, then, enjoy the apartment. Hello, welcome. I'm Yehudit, I live next door. Nice to meet you, I'm Naomi. I want to apologize if Simcha startled you this morning. I've told him not to a million times, he nods his head, as soon as I turn around, he's out the window. Mrs. Gombrovich, of blessed memory, used to give him piano lessons. So this is like his second home. What he did this morning was extremely dangerous, maybe you should put bars on your window. -God willing. Will you honor us with a mitzvah? Children, go inside. Come. Merciful and gracious Lord, protect us in this house. keep us from evil, from illness, from poverty, from sin. Bless our homes, amen. Amen. -Amen. -Amen. Amen. Blessed art Thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who brings forth bread from the earth. Go, go play. Listen, Naomi, if you need a cup of sugar, flour, we look out for one another, this is not Tel Aviv. We always had a wonderful relationship with Mrs. Gombrovich. Though towards the end she wasn't right in the head. I don't want to defame her, God forbid. What do you do? I work at a radio station. -The news? No, "The Voice of Music." -"The Voice of Music?" You're a godsend. Why do you think my orphan came through the window? Why? He's no ordinary boy, my Simcha. He'll go through walls to get to the piano, and you being in the business, you can understand that. Maybe you can give him some tips. You know what? Excuse me... What? -I... I'll give you the owner's phone number... He's trying to get rid of that instrument, so... maybe he'll just give it to you. No, no, no, sweetie. Our apartment is just like yours, two rooms, but we are 6 people, bless God. He's coming to get it in a day or two, wouldn't it be a shame... Listen, Naomi, look, I... I always say... The Torah's ways are ways of pleasantness, but not everyone here's like me, okay? Some of these people are very rigid, very strict, they don't... They see a girl like you, they see red, you know what I mean? -The piano's not mine. Okay, I see. May this apartment be blessed. Rivki, Leah, Dvora, come. Come, sweetie. Simcha come. Yosef, come. Simcha, sweetie, close the piano, say goodbye. Let's go. Hurry up. By the way, Mrs. Gombrovich put this mezuzah up. I'd replace it if I were you. Better safe than sorry. Goodbye. Good morning. Good morning. Someone's waiting for you. Thank you. Hi. Did my parents send you to take me back home? Because you're about to kill yourself and/or terminally lose your mind, but I know Mr. and Mrs. Anxious, so I assume you're alright. I'm fine. -Good. Where have you been for eight months? Can we just get to the part where I beg for your forgiveness on bended knee? We've been together since 9th grade, Freckles. I wanted to play without sheet music, to be on my own, like a big boy. Just like you're doing now. But I didn't like it. I didn't feel like playing at all. It turned out none of it's worth it without you. So the moral is: You and I... we're classical musicians. We have to play what's in front of our eyes. We have to move in together, play concerts and make babies... I missed you, Freckles... And your piano. C, D, E, F, G... I don't touch the piano. Okay. Will you allow me to touch it? Do you mind? I have work to do. Naomi... Thank you. Listen, Simcha... You can't just come into people's homes, especially not from a fifth floor window. You know that, right? It's for me, I got you, did you get me? You don't talk? Can you play anything besides Hayden? What's the rush? Why pianissimo all of a sudden? Do you know what that piece is called? "Pictures at an Exhibition", right? We enter the museum, it's... it's a festive event, a special event. Have you ever been to a museum? Do you know what an exhibition is? All kinds of oil paintings in frames on the walls? Do you only know the overture or the rest of the piece too? Stop. Stop, stop. That's not my instrument. It's not tuned. It's broken. It's giving me a headache... and you have to go to school. Do you go to school? You do go to school, right? Please... don't come over here again without permission. Use the door, please! Excuse me? Excuse me? I can't pay a 100 shekel fine every day. Excuse me? Excuse me, why aren't you answering me? Don't you dare touch me. I'm sorry, I know I need a parking permit, I can't find an area where it's not required, and when I'm at work... -There's the sign, "Parking permit required." You have a parking permit for Tel Aviv. Go park in Tel Aviv. Can't you let it go for a few days? In Jerusalem we have laws. The law determines what's permitted and what's forbidden. I don't make the laws, I just enforce them. Okay, but you can tell that I'm not some criminal, right? And how do I know that exactly? Listen, my name is Naomi Sarid, okay? I just moved in here and I'm just asking that you cut me some slack for a few days. Are you handicapped? Do you have a handicapped parking permit? Next time you put your paws on me, you'll be charged with assaulting a public servant. Some order you made here. I've hardly begun. I'm Dovi, by the way. Naomi. I know. It's me. As security personnel I have access to the database, I hope you don't mind. You could say we're neighbors... I live in Kiryat Yovel too. On Borochov Street. How are you doing on Brazil Street? I hear everyone's ultra-Orthodox. I'm managing. Now you have my phone number, if you want... don't be shy, you can call me any time. I can show you around the neighborhood. Thank you. Okay. Can I ask you a question? Isn't it a waste? A girl like you... Do you mind? I have to work. Yeah, sure... You're right. Can I help you? I heard you playing on Saturday. - I know, I saw you. I was wondering... if... maybe you have a recital sometimes? -We don't have recitals. So... When can I hear you play? -During mass. That means...? -On the holidays. Of course. Okay, thank you. I'm sorry. If you're interested in the organ, I could give you the VIP behind the scenes tour. No, I'm not a VIP. What's your name? Naomi. Naomi? -Yes. Nice to meet you, I'm Brother Fabrizio. An Austrian man built this instrument 120 years ago. It's been renovated a couple of times, but it's still the same machine. 130 pipes. No electricity, no amplification. Please. It's part of the tour. The VIPs can try the keyboards. Did you ever play the piano? It's not so different, if you forget about the pedals. I'm sorry. Thank you for the tour. I have to go. It was good to meet you. Dad. What happened? Did you see this? Come inside. "Dear Jewish father, your daughter, Naomi Sarid, 33 Brazil Street..." Finally we know where you live. "Has succumbed to missionaries in a monastery. "Should this become publicly known, we must warn you "that the neighbors are liable to take the law into their hands "to prevent impurity and assimilation. "Please keep your daughter away from here for her safety. "Sincerely, the committee for a pure Kiryat Yovel." How did you get that? -What are you doing in a monastery? I jog in Ein Karem. There are churches everywhere. You really took that fax seriously? We leave you alone for 10 minutes and you get yourself in trouble. I have an apartment. I have a job and I'm fine. You're living in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood! I get along with my neighbors. Whose piano is that? -The previous tenant. So you're practicing for the recital at the Weizmann Institute? It's in two weeks. You have to decide. You want to cancel? What should I tell the Blumenthal Center? You know this is suicide, right? It's insane. You're a pianist. Who are you without a piano? What kind of person will you be? What are you going to do with your life? -That's what I'm trying to find out. I'm starting from the basics, like a normal, ordinary person. You're having a crisis. So what? It happens to the greatest musicians. Why do you have to take everything to the extreme? Is it because of David? -No. -Because you didn't win the Concourse? Thanks for reminding me. Not to mention that I didn't win the Franz Liszt competition. What is it then? -I don't want to play anymore! What do you mean? What are you, 14? I don't want to play... I have nothing to play for. Maybe we made some mistakes. Maybe we should have let you have more fun. We wanted to push you forward. Classical music is the toughest field. Every achievement is just one step towards perfection. And imperfection... -Means death. Yeah, Dad, I know. I need to think. Alone. And you want to think alone here of all places? What do you think they mean by taking the law into their hands? I'm not made of cotton. -Naomi, you're coming home with me! Please. You don't give up, do you? Simcha. Don't come through the window anymore. And don't give this key to anyone. "The committee for a pure kiryat yovel" "Your search did not match any documents" Good morning. -Good morning. I thought maybe tonight, if you're not too busy, and if you feel like it, I mean... I know a really good restaurant. I thought maybe we could go together. I'm in the middle of something here. Can we talk later? Sure. "Maya Kiryat Yovel Non Religious" Hey. Are you okay? I'm fine. -Good. Can I see the fax? -Yes. I want you to listen to something. Two months ago I got this voicemail. I thought it was a mistake at first. But I waited for my roommate to come home and translate it for me. She's saying: "I'm Irena Gombrovich. They did something to my Sasha. "I'm very frightened." I went to your building to check it out. Then I see a death notice with her name on it. Your neighbors won't tell me anything. So I took the recording to the police. They blew me off. I located her nephew, your landlord. He slammed the door in my face. I can't see the connection. Maybe there's no connection. But let's go to the police to be on the safe side. No, I don't think this requires involving the police. I'm pretty sure it's just some kids who sent me... And I have this weird guy at work... -Naomi, this is war. If people like us just sit still, we'll end up in a secular ghetto in Tel Aviv. I came here for some peace of mind, I'm not really into all that. I'll think about it. Hello. I wanted to apologize for running away the way I did. And... And to ask you if... maybe you would give me pipe organ lessons? I can play the piano. I'll need the abbot's permission. So when should I come back? Let's give it a try. Now? -Yes. What if the abbot says no? He'll be back the day after tomorrow. Would you prefer to wait? Schubert, "Ave Maria," is that okay? Only if that's the only thing you can play. And no "Wedding March." And no "Stairway to heaven," please. Stop, stop, please, stop. Is this some kind of game? I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. Wait. Are you a... professional pianist? -I used to be. You used to be a pianist... Please, close the door. Sit down. Now, give me the name of a famous pipe organ player. Exactly. Pianists think that talent is their private property. I think that talent is a mission, so the first thing pianists have to check at the door, is their ego. In here nobody will applaud you. Nobody will tell you that you're a genius. Okay. Sit down. Make room for me. Sorry? May I sit by your side? -Yes, of course. Now, the button will tell you the diameter of the pipe and the color of the sound. They're names are stupid, I'm sorry. This one, for example, this is our friend "Contre Bombarde." Now, give me a low A with your foot. I call it Zarathustra. And this, this is the Flute Celeste. I call it Gelsomina, after my aunt Monica's late Chihuahua. Now, I know that pianists have trouble reading 3 staffs at first, so I will do the pedals, okay? Fabrizio! These are for you. Thank you. I don't know if you like surprises, but... I reserved a table at "The Sacred Basin". It's one of the top five in the city. So, where did you come from? Tel Aviv. -No, I mean... just now. -Oh... a pipe organ lesson. What lesson? I'm learning to play the pipe organ at an Ein Karem monastery. My teacher's a monk. What? Oh, nothing. It's just that I've never met anyone... I mean, in person. The organ is such a Christian instrument. Once I was in the USA with the youth movement delegation and I heard the pipe organ in a reform synagogue. I don't know, it made me feel... kinda nauseous. It's mixing the sacred with the profane. You know? Personally, it sickens me. Can you pull over, please? What? -I want to get out. Have I offended you? Don't take it personally, I just... Okay, hold on, I'll take you home. -No, no, let me out here. I'll walk. Can you let me pass, please? -Where to? Down below. What for? I live there. -Can't be. There are no brothels in this neighborhood. Can you please let me pass? Slut! -Whore! Excuse me? Excuse me? Excuse me, since when do you give tickets at night? -When there's a sign saying you can't park here, day or night, without a parking permit. This car's in my mother's name. She's not a healthy woman, she gets... Why do I have to hear about your corruption? Why do you think I care? I can't pay for all these tickets. What do you suggest I do? I suggest you take your car and go back to where you came from. But I live here! -The people who live here have parking permits. The people who live here obey the law. Can you please tell me what's wrong with this city? What do you have against people? Either you leave or you pay. There you are. Hello, Yehudit, how are you? -Thank God. You look so nice. -Thank you. Can I ask you a question? -Of course. Do you know the local parking inspector, the one with the beard? Sure. He lives one building over. He lives in this area? Yes, poor couple. They don't have children of their own so he comes around to play with the kids on our block. So you know him personally. Don't get any foolish ideas. In our community, a married man is a married man. You should be praying for a wise Yeshiva student. Can I replace your mezuzah? No, thank you, Yehudit, it's fine. -It's our way of saying thank you. I know what the piano means to Simcha. My husband, of blessed memory, he was totally against it. He said it's neglecting the Torah. And until Simcha turned 6 he insisted he's normal like everyone else. Maybe I made a mistake, I should have put my foot down. Maybe that's why the boy's condition got worse. Oh, where's my head? This came for you today. You weren't home so they gave it to me. Who brought this? A messenger. "Cease all your missionary activities at once." Did he say what company he's from? Did you sign for it? No, no. I don't know. I have no idea. What did he look like? He was wearing a helmet. What's wrong? -What's this? No scroll. Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one. Let's go inside. Listen, Naomi, I have to tell you something, so I don't regret not having told you, God forbid. I think Mrs. Gombrovich... Remember I told you that towards the end she wasn't right in the head? Well, I think she did a horrible thing. There is no place for her in heaven. What she did is worse than murder. What did she do? Never mind. Thank God, at least we're rid of her mezuzah. Blessed art Thou, Lord our God, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to affix a mezuzah. Amen. Amen. Good. Now it will watch over you. Rest assured. Good night. Sweet dreams. Goodnight, Yehudit. Let's improvise. No, I don't... I'm a classical pianist, We believe in the Holy Trinity: Bach, Mozart, Beethoven. You are an Orthodox! You think you can hide behind the holy dead composers but improvising, would be like... letting them read your secret diary. Can I ask you a personal question? I don't know, can you? Why did you take this job, in here? What do you know about Rossini? I know he wrote... forty operas before he was 40? 39. And already they called him "The Italian Mozart." And then? Then he didn't write anymore. -Not exactly. He retired. He wrote only the chamber pieces he played with friends in his living room just for fun. "Sins of Old Age," he called them. Is that what you'd like? To retire? I have retired. And I'm "Sins of Old Age?" Take him home. It's homework. Look at him from time to time, see what happens. Thank you. I'll see you soon. Yes. Bye. Your check bounced. Excuse me? -Your check bounced. Igor, there must be some mistake. Excuse me. It's okay, kid, play. I don't want to deal with his kind. That's why I rented the place to you. One week, two, pay me when you can. But don't make a mistake. And about the piano, the movers will pick it up. Igor, that's okay, the piano can stay. Fine. Can I ask you a question? -What now? Your aunt, Mrs. Gombrovich, how did she die? She died like everyone dies. Are you alright, Simcha? I... I don't understand. Do you want to write it down? Sleep...? You heard something? When you were sleeping? Irena fell out of this window? Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. I'll buy you new sheet music tomorrow. And I'll get someone to tune the piano, you can't play like this. Go ahead. Simcha, did you see anything else? Did you see someone when Irena fell? Did you see anything else? What did you see? Simcha... I came to tell you that Simcha won't be coming anymore. What? I gave you the most precious belonging, this is a child's soul, how dare you?! Everyone knows. Knows what? What are you talking about? Simcha, give her back the key. Give her back the key, Simcha. Where's the key? Look at me, where's the key? Where did you put it? Did you hide it? Look at me when I'm talking to you! It's okay, it was a spare key... -You'll take it back! Let's go! Wait, I bought Simcha a present... -Keep your present to yourself. "Missionary" Is this apartment 60? Yes. I'm Raphael, we talked yesterday on the phone. Yes. Is this a good time? -Yes, yes. What did you put in the piano? Excuse me? You put something in the piano. Can you give me a hand? My fingers aren't lean enough. Yes. "Mrs. Gombrovich, we have been informed that you are a missionary" " Missionaries" The abbot is forbidding your lessons and any work in the community until further notice. What? Is it because of the graffiti outside? They sprayed the same thing on my door. Who? I don't know, I think maybe it's the people who sent me the threat letters. No, please. Please, wait. The woman who used to live in my apartment... Irena Gombrovich, I think she was actually... a Christian. But she didn't tell anyone. And then somehow they found out and started sending her these threat letters... Simcha? Simcha? Get a move on. Yehudit! Yehudit, it's not fair, it's not Simcha's fault. You listen to me, you may have decided never to marry, but I'm a widow with 5 kids, I pray to God He will send me a husband. So my kids will have a father. Please, if you care about Simcha, leave us alone. We have enough problems. Please, take the piano from my place, sign Simcha to the conservatory... -For your own good, leave before... "Out, sinner" Schumann? Who is it? Maya. What's up? I'm fine. I see you got your cast off. Yeah. Can I come in? Yes. Someone broke in? I don't know. Your interior design? I'm fine. Naomi, when will you admit that you have a problem? I don't understand what you want. -I'm worried about you. Maybe the people who messed with Gombrovich... Gombrovich committed suicide, she jumped out the window. How do you know? What does it matter? I gather it makes you feel safer here... I'm studying criminology. It's so easy to stage a suicide and with a little patience you can persuade people to do it. You just have to know what buttons to press. And now they flattened your tires. What? -Didn't you notice? She claims she got anonymous threat mail... Murder threats. Where does it say murder? In Irena Gombrovich's death notice. -Who? The previous tenant, they did the same thing to her and you didn't investigate. Are you here to report a murder? She moved into Gombrovich's apartment, now she's getting threat mail. Draw your own conclusion. If she's getting the mail, why don't you let her talk? She's in shock. You kept her waiting in the corridor all night. You wanna drive her crazy until she drops the complaint, right? You'll do anything not to mess with the ultra-Orthodox. But why won't you let her talk? Maybe you and your anarchist friends decided to harass her to get the cops off their ass? Naomi, say something. I had... a misunderstanding with the neighbors. About what? There's this rumor that I'm a missionary. A missionary? Why would there be a rumor that you're a missionary? I'm learning to play the pipe organ at a monastery in Ein Karem. Learning to play... Why are you writing that down? Who cares what she does for a hobby? Either you be quiet or leave. You get lessons at a church? At a monastery. Yes. -Which monastery? The one they sprayed graffiti on? Yes, but I'm only taking organ lessons. Who's teaching you to play the organ? I'm sorry, I don't want to file a complaint. Can I go? I'm texting someone to fix your tires, free of charge... So that's one less worry for you. But, Naomi... beyond that we can't be responsible for what happens to you. Please understand, we have some conservative members in our group, in terms of the message, this thing with the monastery is a little extreme. Personally, I think it's a good thing, but I'm not alone here. Take care. Okay? "I will stretch out mine hand upon Jerusalem, "I will cut off the remnant of Baal, the Chemarims with the priests." The gate was open. A group from Costa Rica is coming for night mass. I'm sorry, I just... I really... No, no, no. I'm glad you came. I was worried about you. Is everything okay? I ran away... I think I got in trouble with a parking inspector. I'm sorry, I have no connections in the municipality. What does he want from you? If I stay he'll do the same to me as he did to Gombrovich. That's the old lady that got anonymous letters? He scared her so terribly... she jumped out of the window. And then... when I arrived... he decided that I'm... the same kind of... filth he needed to clean. I'm scared to death I believe that if this man wants to get rid of you so bad, it's because he's scared of you. he sees something strong and beautiful inside you that's threatening him. And I think... that you should stand up and show him he's right. They're here. Ciao, Fabrizio. Ciao, Naomi. "Thou shalt not kill" Simcha? Can you get Simcha for me? Simcha, I got you something. I have sheet music for you. Oh my God! What's going on here? Simcha, look outside. Is that him? Don't be afraid of him, he won't harm you. Simcha? Is that him? Is that the man you saw when Irena fell? Is that him? Simcha, is that him? What are you waiting for, Arye? No one is jumping today!
