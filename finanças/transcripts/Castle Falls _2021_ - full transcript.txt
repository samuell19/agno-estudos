That's good. All right, three rounds. I wanna finish, but don't leave it up to me. Time. Vince is in the office. We got a lot of talented guys coming up. Young guys. Potential's all I got to work with. This ain't news, Mike. Vince, come on, please just get me a fight, right? 170, 185, flippin' 205 if I have to. You... you got submitted in your last three fights. None of my sponsors are gonna touch you. Okay, look. I shouldn't have let you fight injured. Some of that's on me. Yeah, well don't worry about that 'cause I got the surgery and the shoulder feels good, right? I'm ready to get back in there, come on Vince, please, please! Mike, you're a friend. But I'm trying to run a business. You're a sparring partner. Oh, I'm a sparring partner, am I? Not a contender. You don't have the killer instinct. I can't make you into something you're not. I'm sorry, it's over. I came here because you sold me on this gym. I came here 'cause of you. Remember that? And now you're just gonna turn around and say, that's it, you're finished? It's a young man's game. You know this. Right, don't do this to me. Okay, you got a lotta good, talented fighters here, yeah? Good talent, but they haven't got what I've got, right? They don't have the experience, they don't have the knowledge of the game. Vince, I'm begging you, please. Mike, I don't know what else to say, I'm sorry. Right, you let me fight for it then, right now. - Mike... - No, you give me one last shot. Right, you owe me. I'll fight your golden boy out there, right now, today, let's do it. He's six weeks out from a fight, and you're not even in shape. Yeah, well he's not gonna have an excuse when I kick the crap out of him then, is he? Come on, Vince. One last shot. I fight him right now, and if I win? You put me on the next card. If he wins, then fine, fine. I'm done, I'll walk away. You're fucking nuts. Okay I did it, he's done. You don't have the killer instinct. It's over. It's over. It's over. I'm gonna have to get a guard dog now that you're leaving. We are gonna miss you. I'll hold onto that deposit, and we'll just call that the last three months' rent. You're a good man, Phil. I really appreciate everything you've done for me. See you around, Phil. You keep your head up, huh? Don't worry about me, Phil, I'm good. Hey Mike, when's your next fight? Come here, lads. Think maybe you guys should take over, don't you? - Thank you. - There you go. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Let's go. - Stay out of trouble. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. It's a young man's game. Skills, degrees? Did a bit of construction back in the UK, in between fights. Other than that, though... Oh, here we go, you're in luck. Oh yeah, what have you got? They've been at it a week, but there's a couple days left. What is it, construction? Not exactly construction, but it's close. All right, buddy? I'm here for the, uh, you know, the construction. You a temp worker? Yeah, Wades, Mike Wades. Oh. Yeah, here ya are. All right man, just head up there. Cheers, man. You guys are here because some bigwig down at city hall said I don't get a contract unless I fulfill some local hiring mandate bullshit. You guys aren't on my roster, so if you ever wanna see a paycheck, don't lose your time card. Now, everything you see in here has gotta go. If it's not supporting something, rip it down. If you got a question about something, come find me. Can't find me? Rip it down. While you're doing that, demolition crew will be placing explosives on the first, fourth, and eighth floors, so stay out of there. Elevators are coming out tomorrow, which reminds me, the freight elevator goes until five. Use it till then. After that, take the stairs. The power's on until we're finished, any questions? Good. Wade, Diaz, grab a sledgehammer. Windows indoors, start from the top and work your way down. Hey. - Hey, Dad. - How you feeling, sweetheart? Better. A little tired. Do you need anything? I'm good, I'm good. Here, have some water. Okay. - Everything okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Sure. Wanna watch some more of that movie, before I gotta go to work? We always watch this. Yeah, but it's funny. Used to like it as a kid. Come on. All right. Here we go, movie time. Good morning, sir. - Hey, Emily. - Hi. Mr. Ericson, do you mind if I speak with you for a moment? Yeah, we're just watching a movie. Just give me a second? I just... This is funny. Your teeth are so bad whenever people wanna say hi to you in the hallway they wanna punch you out of despair! Yeah. You just get some sleep. I'm sorry, Mr. Ericson, but... this is gonna be my last visit until I get paid. Well, I'm waiting for the check from the insurance company. Once I get it, you'll get your money. I'm just, I am so sorry. But I cannot come back here until I get my money. Okay, that's them. Hold on a second. Yeah, hello. One second. We'll work it out, don't worry. It'll be fine. Yeah, one second, one second. Okay, hold on, hold on. Okay, what do you mean it's not covered? Your policy only covers a portion of the treatments with insurance money. Yeah, but that's what her doctor recommended. He said she's strong enough to accept the transplant. She can't do any more chemotherapy. She's very sick now. Yes, but because of how they do this procedure, we have to classify it as experimental. Your policy only covers the first 50,000 dollars. Okay, so, uh, how much is it gonna cost? What do I have to pay? Well, your portion of the bill would be approximately 400,000 dollars. Mr. Ericson, are you still there? But, there's gotta be something else, right? Like, my house isn't even worth that much. There's gotta be like a supplemental policy or something, right? Mr. Ericson, I'm really sorry, but this is the policy you have. Okay, thanks. I'll figure something out. Come on, take me back to my block, huh? Lando, got your ticket to east block. Some people over there wanna have a word with you. Fuck you, man. This is bullshit. I wanna talk to Ericson, you hear me? Forget Ericson. His daughter has cancer. He's gonna be busy with her funeral. You'll be dealing with me now. You owe Damien Glass some money. Look, I don't want no problems. I ain't got nothin' to do with that. Where's your fucking money? Hey, hey, break it up! Mayor's gonna speak. How do you know that? I was just down there. Wade, Diaz! What the hell are you guys doing? Nothin', we ain't doin' nothin'. Yeah, no shit. Listen, all the metal, copper, aluminum, needs to be separated. This is important. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it, we got it, no problem. And somebody took some fruit off of a spread we set up for the mayor. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would ya? Mm-mm. Oh by the way, I didn't get a chance to say before, but I really appreciate the opportunity. You know, I really needed this. Then get to it. We ain't paying you two to dick around. How much fruit can a mayor eat, huh? Here. I've heard it said the Castle Heights hospital is a reflection of the neighborhood. But to see it in its current state of decay, and to equate it with the people of this community, is to do them a great disservice. I too was born inside the segregated walls of this building, but we're not here to dwell on the past. Not when there's work to be done for our future. It's with that work in mind that I stand before you today and humbly ask for your support, as I run for reelection. The city of Birmingham is partnering with some of the finest businesses in the world, to create a new commercial district right here. We ain't going anywhere. We're here to better ourselves. We're here to better Birmingham, Alabama. This Sunday, the Castle falls! Hey, guard. Let me talk to the lieutenant. Hey, you hear me? Let me talk to Ericson! Hey, let me talk to Ericson! You better have something real important to tell me. I got a proposition for you. Move me back to south block. They gonna kill me if you don't. I'm sorry, I don't make deals with inmates. Take it up with the warden. You know I can't trust nobody else in here. I need you to hear me out. - Okay, we're done here. - Look, it's money in it for you. I'm talking a lot of money. I'm trying to help you out. You got a family, don't you? Don't talk about my family. You got a daughter, right? I know you wanna help your daughter out, right? Don't you fucking mention my daughter! Don't you talk about my fucking daughter! Get the fuck off of me. Shut the fuck up, motherfucker, shut up! Shut the fuck up! You don't talk about my family, you understand? ...man, I'm telling you. Don't mention my family! I just found out. Why would Ericson move him back to south block? What's he give a shit? Didn't think he would, based on how their little powwow played out. So why move him, then? Unless he's getting paid off, and that was all a show for the camera. Ericson never struck me as the bribe-able type. Never can tell. You know, he's the only reason Lando ain't dead in the first place. And I hear that he needs a lot of money for his daughter's surgery. Something like 400 grand. He's getting paid by Lando? That's my money payin' him. Who's got my outside line? Time to let my brother loose. Ericson wants to pull strings? Let's pull some fuckin' strings. Let's pull some strings. I'll be back, and don't forget me. Hey, Deacon. We got a problem. Come on. So how'd it go? Tested 90 percent pure. Saved 50 grand, too. Your brother needs to upgrade his suppliers. You gonna tell him they were outbid by some Mexicans? You see, my brother... Mm-hm? He's a victim of his own ideology. Me, on the other hand... Mm-hm? Only thing I care about is money and power. Mmm. He just called. Little problem we gotta take care of. We're getting rich, baby. The president spoke today with France's prime minister after the incident. In other news, a New Jersey case is now... Shh. You wanna make a deal, Lando? Start talking. Tell me everything. Look, Damian's moving dope up and down the highway, and maybe he's getting tipped at checkpoints, I don't know. But he started making detours through the hospital park, and he and everybody knows the park belong to me. So you stole his money and now he wants you dead? Shoot that, plus his money back. How much? Three million, cash. Yeah. Look. If I can't get it, I want something for it. Move me back to south block. All right, done. Where's the money now? Castle Falls Hospital. Now we're turning it over to our weather. We have some low clouds around today. Expect clouds to thin out... Hey, Deacon. Think I know where your brother's money is. There ya are. 'Sup? Hoo. You know, I used to live here, you know? You used to live here? I thought it was a hospital. Mm, children's residential center. This floor and the seventh, in the tower, yeah. It was kinda like an orphanage for kids whose parents died, or went to jail. Not my mom, though, no. She, uh, she just worked all the time, never home, so judge decided it was better for me to spend more time here than, you know, by myself. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I had no idea that they could do that. Neither did she. This place was kinda like a spot for kids who were waiting to get into foster care, but really it was for the kids that got kicked out. Two years, yep. You know, I could go home on the weekends, but those kids did not like that. Mexican kid with a deal? Used to beat my ass every chance they got. Fuck this place. I would've knocked it down for free. - I'm Mike. - George. - How you doing? - Good. Yeah, they were saying the elevators are out. Keeps you fit though, right? I guess. So what's up with you, man? What's up with that accent, where you from? Me, I'm from Birmingham. You know, the one in the UK, the original. What the hell are you doing over here? I've been asking myself the same thing, to be honest. You ever hear of Paramount Gym? Yeah, yeah, yeah, the MMA... the MMA gym. The one in Atlanta with all the champions. That's the one, I trained there, yeah. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I've seen you before, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I knew you looked familiar, man, yeah! You... I saw your fight - at the convention center, dude. - You saw me fight? Yeah, you knocked the hell outta the guy, the mean ugly guy with the mohawk. Oh that guy, yeah, yeah, real nice piece of work. You saw that fight? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Knocked him out with a spin kick, right? - Yeah, I remember. Oh man. I can't believe you saw that fight. He got ya. I got it. Not a contender. You know, I'm starting to like this stuff. No you don't, since when? Since you play it all the time. You know, but I prefer the classics. Biggie, Tupac, they were, you know, poets. I don't understand what these new guys are saying half the time. Don't worry, I'll teach you. - This is one of my favorites. - Oh yeah? Dad! Oh shit, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good. Can you, uh, can you ask Leah to come over this afternoon? 'Cause I gotta do some stuff with work, you know? - I may be late. - I can be at home one night by myself. Yeah, but she wanted to see you, and I. - Okay, I will. - All right. Whoa. Okay. Just the way she used to make it. I miss Mom so much. Yeah. Yeah, I miss her too. She'd be so proud of you. Like it? It's good. Everything's gonna be fine, don't worry. So what are you doing after this? I don't know, man. Try and get in somewhere, I guess. Depends who's hiring. What, you got something? I just meant like, today. A bunch of us are gonna go down to the bar and watch this place come down on TV. Oh yeah, sure man. Sorry, I thought you meant you had a lead on a job or something. - I mean, actually I might. - Yeah? It seems legit, just didn't know if you'd be interested, you know? Hey listen, mate. If the money's real, I'm interested. Dump everything down the elevator shaft. They're rigging charges in the compactor. They're behind schedule. There's 12 floors, 100 plus rooms. The longer they take, the less time we have. Leave it to my brother to wait till the last possible minute. Everybody sit tight. We'll go in when they clear out. - I hate playing up this family shit. - I know. It's bad enough I gotta clear up his mistakes. Fuck my brother. - Hmm. - That money's ours. I love it when you're selfish. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. We're done here. We'll clear out once they set the charges. That means hard out by two PM, so let's pick up the pace. Okay, come on. What's the catch? It's in Alaska. Oh, no shit. Yeah. What? Come on man, it could be fun. Alaska, though? Yeah, yeah. You know what it is? - They got beautiful women in Alaska, man. - Yeah, sure. They got moose and shit, too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Have you ever even seen a moose? Hell no, but that's why I wanna go. - I bet you do. - Yeah. Get some of that moose meat, and then you give it to one of those Eskimo chicks. Then she loves you forever. They do... they do the Eskimo thing. I don't know, I don't know, we should check it out. I mean, it's worth checking out. - All right, ready? - Yeah. Three, two, one, go. Woo-hoo. No, but it's gonna be a good opportunity, really. A lotta good money here, man. Lotta money to be made in Alaska. - Yeah? - Yeah. So what about you man, you got any kids? No, man. What about you? Yeah, two of 'em. But they're at school right now, so their mom won't care if I go have a drink at this party. It's time to get outta here. Hey man, you comin'? Yeah, yeah, yeah, comin', comin'. - Yeah, let's go man. - Yeah. - What's wrong? - Nothin'. Let's go. All right, gentlemen, say your goodbyes. That's all she wrote. It's time to go. Good, keep moving. Keep moving. Wade, Diaz, let's go! Thank you, it's a pleasure to meet you. Absolutely. It's beer 30, gentlemen. Enjoy yourselves. Come on, come on, come on. Come on guys, you wanna get left here and get blown up? Some of us have families to get home to. Not all of us have appointments with bar stools. Babysitter's here. My brother sends his regards. You have some big shoes to fill. He was a visionary. Yeah, well he'll be glad to know that you were here today to help me right this wrong. The spirit of what he created is alive and well in this very room. Three million dollars, in a building that's gonna be dust inside three hours. We don't know where it is. We don't have time to go looking for it. We're looking for the man that betrayed this family. Put my brother's life in danger. Follow the guard, find the money. What the hell are you doing? Like your opinions. Like, actually, yeah... - Kinda like him. - Yeah. But they have good songs, too. I would listen to emo music. That stuff is sometimes really funny. Yeah. The rap is better there. - Bye, guys. - Bye. - Bye, Dad. - All right, see you soon. But yeah, I think this one's good. Yeah, play that jam. Good to see ya. How are ya, okay, how are ya? Look at this here. We're gonna have lots of activity over here. This is all gonna come down. We'll have a nice big civic center here. It won't even matter, because we're not gonna do what you did last time. I'm not doing that man, I'm not. I'm telling you, man, you and all the shots. It was your idea. - Hey, George. - Yeah? I think I'm gonna pass on that drink. - Are you serious? - Yeah man, I'm tired. Don't act like you got something better to do, man. Come on, we're all gonna go. Everybody's gonna have a good time. - Ah, shit. - What? - I left my jacket. - Oh, forget the jacket. I can't forget my jacket, the punch card's inside my jacket pocket. I've gotta go back and get it. Are you serious? Wait, wait, wait, we'll all go with you. We'll all go with you. No, don't make a big thing out of it. - Hey, what's the hold up? - What're you waiting for? Punch out already! Listen to me, get the beers, and I know where the jacket is. - I'll see you in a minute. - You sure? Yeah man, I'm good. I'm good. Be careful. ...heard it said the Castle Heights Hospital is a reflection of the neighborhood. But to equate it with the people of this neighborhood... Attention. Clear the area. We have 90 minutes till detonation, clear the area. Attention. Clear the area. We have 90 minutes 'til detonation, clear the area. Attention. Clear the area. He's goin' in. Afternoon. Can I help you? Asbestos disposal. Yeah, I don't think so. We're locked up, guys. I mean, this place is gonna be toast at five. Are you sure you got the right building? Sure as eggs is eggs. All right, well, let me check first. Mmm, uh-uh. Oops, give me the keys. Right there on my hip, sir. Just, please. Why don't you find a comfy place for our friend here? Okay. All right guys, we gotta get inside. Back the truck up. Get in. What, do you see my hands right now? They took my keys. What do you want me to do? Somebody pop this trunk! Hey, wait a minute. I know you. Yeah, you used to dance over at Frisky's on Route 22, didn't you? Just get everything prepped, 100 percent. I'm right, ain't I? I couldn't forget a scar like that, sweetheart. Damn. He recognized you. What was I supposed to do? All right. Help me out. Yes! Fuck, yes, come on! Shit. Did you see where he went in? Over there. He's headed for the lobby. All right, go check around back. Manny, go with him. Everybody else, with me. Let's go get this guy. This is the fun part. There's no elevators. We got nothing. Fuck it, pick a floor and search it. The money's here somewhere. So is the guard. All right, James. Take the back stairs. Caleb, circle the building. Nobody gets out. Duke, you stay here. You see something, you put it on the radio. Eyes and ears open, guys. Kat and Eddie, you're with me. Let's move. Spread out, find the money. Everybody, now. Damn it. Get over here, let me know if you see something. Move, move! Wait, did you hear that? Eighth floor, now. What the hell? Go! What's going on? Search this floor. We're gonna take the ninth. Yo, you know the whole building's wired with explosives, right? Yeah, boss. Shit. What happened? He got the money. Oh, your brother's gonna be pissed. It's gotta be in here. Everybody listen up. Nothing changes. Spread out, nobody leaves until we find it. Copy that. Got him, he's down by the trash room. On my way. Go, go, go, we got him, outside. You got the wrong guy. I don't know who you guys are looking for, but I'm not him. Shut the fuck up! We caught this rat lurking. What are you doing lurking around here after hours? Get the fuck up. I work here, I'm part of the crew. I left my punch card inside, that's it. Oh, well looky here. Hmm. Where's the fucking money? I don't know anything about that. I don't know anything about any money. Caleb, who is he? Never seen him before. Hey. Where's Ericson? He ain't with the guard. This guy's a nobody. Yeah. He knows something, don't ya, ain't that right? I don't know anything, man. Just let me go, please, just let me outta here. Shh. Come on, man. I got a better idea.

Okay, okay, okay, just... just... just calm down, all right? I can take you there, I can take you to the money, but... Fuck, are you trying to blow this place up? Get your fucking hands off me. Don't ever touch me again. Fuck. Take it easy, cowboy. I don't see him. There's nothin' down here but a bunch of damn dynamite. I'll go check the back way. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing here? Who are you? I'm with the demo team, okay? I work here. Where's the money? - What money? - Bullshit! Whoa, whoa, whoa, listen, listen, listen, I left my punch card in my jacket upstairs, all right? I came back here to get it. I'm not with these guys, okay? They killed my friend, and they're trying to kill... Okay. So you know what they'll do if they find us. Okay. Stay cool, all right? Okay, we're gettin' out of here. Stop it, stop it! I got 'em. Trash room. Okay. - Hey, hey, take it easy. - Hey, don't move. Look, you hit the dynamite, you'll bring this whole place down. He ain't lying, mate, look around. Back up, back the fuck up! Be real smart about this, kid. - What did I just say? - Now listen to me, listen, just put the gun down, all right? You got us, no one's going anywhere. Somebody hurry down to the trash room, quick. I'm gonna need some help. Help! Stop. They'll be here any second! Are you crazy? Am I the only one that gets how dynamite works around here? Go! Thank you, thank you, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir, all right. I got him. Two guys, back staircase. I'll cover the outside. Block all the exits. Nobody gets out 'til we've got the money. Get up there! Deacon, I think I got a concussion or something. I look like I give a fuck? Get your ass up there! Listen up, both of you! I'm gonna give you one chance to get out of this alive. Trust me on that. You throw the money down, we leave, you can leave. Gonna count to three. Then this offer goes away. One! Two! Three! Hey, don't shoot me, asshole. This fucking guy. Miss me? Where's the fucking money? Make a deal. Tell me where the fucking money is, and I'll hold your hand when you die. Hey! 200 meters away, Mr. Mayor, just to be safe. They never leave this shit hole. We bury them here. Holy shit. Let's go. Okay, let's go. They know we're here. Hey, hey, I'm on your side. I don't remember asking for your help, mate. Wanna tell me where the money is? - What money? - You know what I'm talking about. Hey, cut the bullshit! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're bleeding. You're bleeding. All right? Come on, in here. Come on! So, who are these guys? Paramilitary group. Call themselves the Five Families. The guy with the tattoo on his neck is Deacon Glass. He runs things for his brother in prison. So how do you fit into this? I'm a guard there. Glass tried to kill this other inmate, a drug dealer by the name of Lando Collins. Claims Collins stole a bunch of his money. Stashed it in here somewhere. Okay, so you just figured you'd come here and take it, is that it? - Is that why you're here? - Yeah, something like that. What about you? Like I said, I just work here. We're heading down to nine. Look, you're not getting out of here alone, and I'm not leaving without the money. So cut the shit, tell me where it is. Fuck you, mate, right? Buy a ticket and get in line. No one's forcing you to be here, are they? All right, asshole. What's the plan, how are we getting out of here? Does it look like I got a plan? Haven't thought that far ahead, okay? Can't remember the reason I'm in this shit in the first place. Oh. One of 'em's hurt. Where the fuck is he, then? Hey are we losing? 'Cause it really feels like we're losing. And isn't this damn building gonna blow up soon? Shut up! See, why you gotta talk to me like that, James? How do you feel about killing somebody? 'Cause us getting out of here's pretty goddamn dependent on it. Pretty sure I already did kill someone. Kicked some bloke down the elevator shaft. Can't find 'em anywhere. There's too many places to hide in here. What do you want me to tell you, man? They're sitting on my money, they've got it! You need to find them! Fucking go, now! Let's go. Fuck 'em, if they wanna play hide and seek, then let 'em. We need to get the hell outta here. Let's go. Kiss my ass, old man, I'm leaving. You're not gonna get very far with that attitude. Whatever! - I need a gun. - Hey wait, wait, wait. Hey, what'd I tell... Fuck! - Put it down! - Shoot him. - Don't do it, I'll kill you! - I said shoot him! Maybe I should hold onto that. Move! You hold it. Ah, ah, ah, hey. Come on, we need to move. No, they followed you here, didn't they, these guys? They came here because of you, right? Look, we gotta get moving. No, I want you to tell me what you're really doing here. We don't have time for this shit. I wanna know now! You tell me! Okay. My daughter's very sick, blood cancer, she's dying. Now there's one way to save her. Either I'm leaving here with enough money to pay for it, or I'm staying here so my life insurance will. That's hers. Who fired those shots? Shit. I said, who fired those shots? Can you hear me? That guy you killed down there, he was an innocent man. Now you're gonna pay for that. So if you want your money, it's up here with me, so come and fucking get it, asshole! Can we go now? Jesus Christ. Hey! How about a heads up next time you do something stupid? Yeah, all right, heads up. Look, you're gonna get us both killed. Look, are you coming or not? What's your daughter's name? Emily. Emily. Thanks. Yeah, you just make sure she gets it. 20 minutes. Let's get out of here alive. What's going on? You know I used to live here. I was there, I thought it was awesome. You, I saw your fight! You know I had 41 professional fights? 41 fights, and I can count on one hand the amount of times somebody's recognized me. They killed my friend. All right. If you don't get out of here now, we're both gonna be dead. Okay? Let's go. Come on. How you doing, son? You gotta be kidding me. They're headed back down. Take the back, split up, go! Jesus, how'd you plan to carry all this? I don't make plans. One second. Hey, sweetheart. Where are you, still working? Yeah, you okay sweetheart? I'm fine. I'm, you know, I'm in the middle of something. I just, I gotta go okay, I love you. Wait, can Leah stay over tonight? Sure. We were thinking to order Chinese. Do you want anything? Um, okay. Order me everything. Okay, I love you, I gotta go. You sound weird, Dad. I'm fine, honey, okay? Love you very much, I'll see you soon, all right? Bye. Bye. You know what? I think I have got a plan. Why do I have a bad feeling about this? Here, all right. So this is what I'm thinking. We throw the bags down there, and then we climb down the shaft. How do you know they're not down there?
