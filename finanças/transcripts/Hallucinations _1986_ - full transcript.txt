(mysterious music) (laughing hysterically) - Come on! (claps) Come here, boy! (clapping) Stay there. Stay. (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) (cat meowing) Where is it? Ah. Hello? Is this Phone Freak Fantasies? - [Woman] Yes. I'm gonna stick the phone on my panties. - I like that. (man singing) - Bull shit. ♪ All with you as well ♪ ♪ It all begins ♪ (mysterious music) - Hey that's a good book, I read it. - Hey asshole. - I'm sorry. You know there's something wrong with that tractor. I got it stuck and this weird guy, this monk that lives in the house across the road, he had to come and help me get that damn thing unstuck. - Yeah. Where the hell is your brother at anyway? (mysterious music) - "Kids. "I have to work a double shift tonight. "Dinner's in the oven. "See you later, love Mom." - What the hell are you staring at? - She's not your mother. - She's nothing. - That's not fair. John. ("Silent Night") - Hi Mark, what are you up to? - Why does Mom have to work so late? - Well maybe she's just having trouble paying the bills. (phone ringing) Maybe that's her now. Hello? - [Man] You know who this is. (suspenseful music) - Who is this? (man whispers) Who is this? - [Man] You know what's going to happen. - Was it that man? - What man? Mark mentioned something about some guy down the road. - Yeah your brother mentioned something about it downstairs earlier. Kid's an asshole. - Jesus, everyone dumps on him 'cause he's slow. It's not his fault. Yeah, well, he ditched the tractor and banged the side up a little bit. We'll just have to watch him a little more. (mysterious music) (cat meows) (chainsaw buzzing) (screaming) (haunting music) What's wrong, Mark? - My cat, she's dead, she's dead! - There's nothing on your hands. - There was. There was blood. She's dead, I know it. - Just calm down and tell us what's wrong. - It was in the cellar. There was a chainsaw. There was blood. There was my cat and she's dead! - Would it make you feel any better if I went down and checked? - [Mark] Yes, could you please? It would make me feel so much better. (suspenseful music) - Holy shit. Todd, come here. - You found something, didn't ya? - No, stay there! Wait. - [Todd] What? - It's not here. - [Todd] Come on. - Where'd it go? There was a saw here. There was blood everywhere. (mysterious music) (mysterious music) - Where the hell's he going? - I don't know. - What's he doing? - Don't know. - When's your mom get home anyway? - Tonight, she went to visit Gram. - What's going on with Mark anyway? - I don't know, he's never acted this way before. But I know one thing, I saw that saw in the cellar and there was blood and hair all over it and I can't find the cat now, so... - Well I didn't see it. - Well I didn't imagine it! - Right, and your brother was talking to a tree. - Well I don't know. Maybe we're all nuts. (groaning) (retching) - John, you all right? John? (retching) You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. (suspenseful music) (wind whistling) - Just lay down on your bed. - Yeah I think I will. - John's gonna rest, just leave him alone. - Is he sick? (suspenseful music) (groaning) (screaming) (groaning) - What's going on? (vacuum whirring) - Todd. Turn it off, I can't hear. Turn that off. - [Todd] What the hell do you want? - What's wrong with my brother? You didn't tell me. What's wrong? - He's sick of you, now just leave him alone. - Where's my cat, where is she, what happened to her? - I don't care what happened to your cat, just get outta here. (vacuum whirring) - You don't like me just because I'm slow! Well how would you like if I am retarded? (shouts) - [Todd] God. - Here kitty kitty kitty. Here kitty. Here kitty. Kitty kitty. Kitty. Come on. (patting) I know you're down here. (suspenseful music) (laughing hysterically) (gasping) (breathing heavily) - You've been having those bad dreams again, haven't you? - Big knife. Big knife. Bad, bad! - Just get some rest. How you feeling? - I'm feeling a little better. - Brother ran into me terrified. Has he ever had any problem with nightmares and stuff? - Hallucinations. - What? - Hallucinations, they're nightmares but you're not asleep, you're awake. Your mind plays tricks on you. It makes you see things that aren't really there. - That's a wild theory. - That's the problem. I can see it in his eyes. I know 'cause I've had it too. - When? - Let me tell you about it. (mysterious music) (muttering) (phone ringing) - Hello? Mom. How are you? Yeah, they're here. It's not that bad. What do you mean you're not coming home? Well what am I gonna do? Okay. I'll tell 'em. Okay. Love you too. Bye. (warped laughing) (screaming) (screaming) (laughing) Mom's not coming home. - [Todd] Go get John, we have to talk. - John, John! Todd has to tell us something. It's important he says! - Right now? I was just about to take a shower. - No no, come on, right now. - Okay, has to be right now. What is it that is so important? - Hallucinations, I'm having them too. - So it just wasn't me, it's everyone. - I was just standing there and it happened. - This is really weird. - I knew something bad was gonna happen. I knew something was going on. Storm. Mom, she's not coming home. And that monk, that man who I always see, he talks to me, he tells me these things. - There is no damn monk. - But there is! - It's all in your head you stupid idiot. - Well then it must be in all of our heads! We're all having these hallucinations! - A monk walking around with you retarded brother has nothing to do with us. - It does! - It does, it does! - Just shut up. He's the one that started all this. - Nuh uh, I think he's the only one that knows what's going on. There's something supernatural happening here, something we don't understand, some intangible terror! - Supernatural? Get a grip on yourself. There's gotta be a natural explanation to this. - Natural? Then why in the hell don't you tell me what it is? - Stop it, we gotta stick together! (crying) - Just open your eyes. You're acting just like your brother. - Why don't you stop being so pigheaded? - Why don't you, you son of a bitch? - Look who's talking. Your real parents didn't even want you! (crying) (shouting) (eerie ambient music) - It's happening again! It's happening. Why can't things just go back to the way they were? - You cocksucker, you're gonna pay for this. - Fuck you. - Bastard. (suspenseful music) (groaning) (beeping) (beeping) - Mark, John! (screeching) (gasping) (eerie ambient music) (screaming) (screeching) (eerie ambient music) (eerie ambient music) (gasping) - There's something wrong here. It's happening to all of us. - I know there's something wrong! - I'm scared. - Where's Todd? - Downstairs. - You stay here, I'll be right back. Todd! Todd, get up. You okay? Here, sit down, sit down. This place is freaking out. - That hallucination, it almost killed me. - I was just attacked in the shower and Mark, he's hysterical. - Well how the hell can we stop this? - I don't know! (suspenseful music) (banging) - Probably that rascal. (shouts) (laughing) (intense percussive music) (shouting) No, no! (screams) (choking) (haunting music) (howling) (giggling) (laughing) (taunting) - Kitty. You killed my kitty, you did it. No, no! Bad, you're bad, you're bad! (squeaking) Bad! - [Doll] You can't kill me, Marky. (laughing) - No, you can't hurt me, you can't, you're not real. You can't do anything. I gotta tell you something. - I gotta go call for help. - No, no, we're just gonna get the hell out of here! - We're gonna call for help. - No, we're just gonna get the fuck outta here! Man, fuck this shit. - Wait, oh wait! - For once just shut up! (ominous organ music) Where are those car keys? Now what? - Todd, oh my god. - [Mark] What's wrong, Todd? - What are you doing? (choking) Todd. - I can't see a thing. (bones crunching) But you're dead! - I'm always dead. - No, you're not real! You're not real. You're not real! (groaning) You aren't real! You aren't real! (choking) What are you doing? Are you okay? Grab him and get the hell outta here. (haunting music) - Come on, what's wrong? Open the door, open the door. - It won't open. Just have to break a window! We're trapped. - [Man] Die, die, you rotten filthy son of a bitch, bastard, you don't deserve to live, you filthy, rotten, you're gonna burn in hell, your insides are gonna leak out your body. (whispering) - Mark, go find Todd. - Todd. (mumbles) - [John] Hurry. (mysterious music) (door creaks) - Todd, Todd, where are you? Come on. Hurry. Todd? Todd. Oh my god. Oh no! Todd. There was blood. He's dead! - [Demon] Your friend is already dead. It's your turn. - What the hell are you? What the fuck do you want? - [Demon] Ask your brother. - Dude, do you know about this? What do you know about him? - [Demon] He's been in on all this all along. Go ahead, kill him. Choke him to death, twist his neck. (choking) - No, no! - [Demon] Yes. - No. He's not real. - What are you talking about? Goddamnit, it's standing right there! - In our minds. I was trying to tell you that. He can't do anything to us. Don't you see, don't you see? That is us. That's the separation of us. The wedge between us caused these hallucinations and these phantoms, they made us grow apart. - [Demon] No! - We created it. We can destroy it. Todd, he couldn't face his problems. He killed himself. All we have to do is realize everything. - [Demon] No! - Don't you see? It was the separation. It'll all end. Once we face ourselves. - We gotta stick together. (roaring) - Don't let it happen again. (crying) - I won't. I won't. (mysterious music) (rapid piano music)
