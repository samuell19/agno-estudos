(clamoring and cheering) El Presidente! - Speech! - Speech! - Hey. - [Man] Okay, buddy, go find your thrill. - Yeah. - Come on. - All right, all right, man, I got a speech. I got a speech, it's called Vegas Caper Part Two. Anybody interested? - Sure! - [Several] Yeah! - Hey, man, it starts tonight. (clamoring) Hey man, get the rest of the members. - Thanks for your speech. - Woo! - [Woman] Hey hey! (clamoring) - We were worried about you, man. Nobody'd tell us where you were. All we heard was that those Vegas cats cut you up pretty bad. - Why didn't you tell us where you were? - [Man] Why didn't you tell us? - Well, you finally let us go get 'em for you, huh? - Look, man, I'm gonna have to set you straight. Now I've waited a long time for this. And I'm gonna get 'em for myself. You and the rest of this club are gonna come along. Because if some punks from Vegas can come down here and wipe out the president, and get away with it, then you better get rid of your putter and get a job sellin' shoes. - Now hold on, Mother. - Either you're in or out! That's the way it is. (engines rumbling) (rock music) - [Man] Hey Mother, there's only one lousy bike. - One's better'n nothin'. (honkytonk music) ♪ If I could cross and belly against the bar ♪ ♪ I could sing all the things that wouldn't all ♪ - [Mother] All right, we got one of 'em. Let's find out where the rest of these clowns are. - Hey, man, wait a minute; what is this? - I'll show you what it is! (grunting) - You're in the presence of royalty, baby! - [Mother] Where are the rest of your punk friends, man? - How the hell would I know? - Where? - Didn't quite hear ya. - They went to LA; you know, for a run. - Sure, yeah, you remember, the road to LA? - [Mother] There's only one road to LA, and we were on it. Now where did they go? (grunting) - [Man] Don't ever do that again. - [Mother] Where? - A run in the desert. - Where in the desert, clown? - Come on, come on. - Hey man, Baby and his friends here didn't forget the words when they wasted me. Did you, Baby? (grunting and coughing) - All right, all right, right. They're at a place called Devil's Head. An old mine out in the desert. - Where in the desert? - Take 15 to Good Springs, and turn off at the second fork to the right. (clattering) (clamoring) - Everything's cool, man, we'll find 'em. - Yeah, meanwhile let's get outta here, before we all get busted. Sooner we get out in the desert, the sooner we find 'em, right? - Yeah, I know how you feel. But most of us are pretty wasted, man. We'd like to relax a little bit. Pick up some other action in Vegas. (honkytonk piano music) If you're worried about Marlene, there's no need to be. She always was your old lady. I guess she still wants to be. - Oh, I'm not so sure, man. Know what I been doin' for the last two months? Layin' in some funky hospital makin' straw baskets. There's no way I'm gonna get myself together, Ben, until I find those punks. - I know, but you need the rest of the club, man. Give 'em a night on Vegas. First thing in the mornin', we'll take off for the desert. (honkytonk piano music) - Nah, I gotta go. Tell the rest of 'em to meet me at two o'clock, at Second and Green. (traffic roaring) (piano music) - Bad town to ride alone. - Well, let's get cookin'. - Hey, mm.

Not like this. (sighs) It's like he's gotta think about something. Nothin' and nobody matters to him except getting even. (rock music) (engines rumbling) (tires squealing) - Hey, shirt! (door latch clicks) (funky music) Hyah! (blows thudding) (blues rock music) (thudding) (blows thudding) (blows thudding) (footsteps echoing) - [Man] Yeah, man. - [Man] Ha, hey, hey! (clattering) - All right, hold it! What's going on here? - Punks jumped us. - Oh, yeah. - Shut it, both of you! I don't wanna hear any lip from either one of you! - Hell, I was just playin' the flute, Officer. - All right, move! - Where? - Come on, move out! Let's get going. - Come on, come on. - Come on, come on, keep moving. - Come on! - Let's go, let's get it goin'. - [Man] Come on, move it out! (women exclaim) - All right, keep it moving. - [Officer] Right down to the bottom, get goin'. - All right. - Okay, okay, join your group, get down there. (clamoring) Come on! (women shrieking) All the way! (exclaiming) - What are you... (laughing) - [Man] Hey, move it! (exclaiming) - All right, you punks. You got 10 minutes to get out of town. If you're not outta town in 10 minutes, you'll be here in a year. - You'll be here when-- - Shut up, preacher! - Hey, man. - You can talk all you want when you're out of town, now move! (grumbling) - [Man] Hey, where's my gas at, man, how... - Move it, move it. - Come on, for-- - All right, all right.

(engines rumbling) (slow rock music) (rock music) - (speaking faintly) Animal's got a flat! - Oh, for Christ's sake, well tell him to hurry up. - Yeah, boss, yeah sure. (engine rumbling) (shouting faintly) Woo! (engines rumbling) - Hey Roach, look, look, it's a band! (speaking faintly) (Roach imitates engine roaring) (laughing) - You know, I'm surprised we got this far without blowin' a tire. You know, damn lucky it didn't really come off. - Lucky? If I had my way, we'd still be in Vegas. - Yeah, but you don't have your way. And we're not in Vegas, are we, Animal? - You bet your sweet life we're not. - Don't let us hang you up, man. If that's where you wanna be, go ahead. Only don't get in our way. - [Fingers] You want some help? - [Animal] Maybe in a minute, you can help me get the tire off. (tools clinking) (fly buzzing) - Hey man, you sure you wanna go to Devil's Head? - Why don't you just keep off everybody's back? - Move it, bitch. (tools clinking) (speaking faintly) - Goddamn this sand. I'm never gonna get it out of my hair. What I wouldn't give for a nice long, cold shower. - What I wouldn't give for a nice long, cold anything. - If it was cold I'd let you have mine. - Man, if it were cold, nobody would want it. (laughing) (clicking) (fly buzzing) - [Woman] Cockroach, what are you doing? - [Cockroach] Lookin' for bugs. - [Woman] What? - [Cockroach] I'm hungry. - [Woman] You know, you're crazy. - Listen, if you really wanna ride bikes, you gotta eat bugs. Now cockroaches, water bugs, other types of household bugs, and lizards are very good. (fly buzzes) The thing to do is not to think about it. Matter of fact, next to girls, I'll eat a bug. (wind roaring faintly) - You know somethin', Cockroach? - What's that? - You're disgusting. (laughing) - Come on, Animal, shake it up. - [Animal] Get him a beer, Mouse. - [Fingers] We're doin' all right, Mother. - Beer, man? - How many we got left? - Oh, two, three maybe. - Give it to somebody else. - I'll take it, bring it here. - All right, the party's over, let's get on the road. - Maybe this thing at Devil's Head'll straighten him out huh? - Man, let's hope so. - Straighten somebody out. - Yeah. (engines rumbling) - [Man] Let's get it moving. (rock music) (motorcycle thudding) - [Man] Hey, wait a minute, Chief's down! - What happened? - Hey, hold on, go tell Mother the Chief's down. - [Man] Goddamn roads. - [Man] And give the red to the people back here. (rock music) - [Man] Hey, somebody fall down? - Christ, I didn't even see that one comin'. What the hell kind of maniac designed-- - [Mother] If you'd've been on the road, this wouldn't have happened. (clamoring) - Hey! - Hey, hey hey. Relax, man. (engine rumbling) - All right, let's get movin', Captain Quick is all right. (engines rumbling) (rock music) - [Animal] Hold it, man, we're stoppin'. Now we need a break, baby. Now this place looks as good as any. (engines rumbling) - Man, didn't you see that place back there? It looked outta sight. - Come on, man, let's stop. - Let's smoke some dope, man. - There's water over there, and shade, and we're wasted, Mother. - This place is a dump. - And I'm pretty wasted too. Now just over the ridge here we got Baxter. They got food, water, oil, gas, everything we need. We can make it there in an hour with no sweat. - No sweat, huh? - Yeah, no sweat. All right, come on, let's go. (engine rumbling) (rock music) - [Man] That's the rest of the goddamn-- - Hey, (speaking faintly). (overlapping voices) - [Woman] Oh my God, second person down. (engines rumbling) (fly buzzing) (gasping) (slurping) - How much father do you think it is? - You heard what the man said, just over the next ridge. - Yeah, look where the next ridge is. - I'm hip. - It's madness, man. We should've stopped back there in Goody Springs or whatever the hell it was called. - Yeah, this is really screwed. - [Animal] I've had just about enough of this. (fly buzzes) - All right, everybody's through with their little siesta. Moldy, you pack with Skin. Get on the road. - What? - [Mother] You heard me, put him on your bike and let's get goin'. - What about his bike? - Never mind his bike. - I need my back, man, I ain't leavin' my bike for nobody! - What is it now? - It's him, man, he wants Moldy to leave his bike. - Now that is different. Leavin' a man's bike in this rotten desert. A bike is a delicate machine, you just don't go leavin' it anywhere! Now Moldy's done every cent his old lady could get in that bike, and if I were him, I wouldn't leave it. - He's right, man; now I could see maybe leavin' your old lady behind or somethin'. But not his bike. - Animal, how long will it take you to get Moldy's bike back on the road? - We still gotta clean the-- - You got 10 minutes. If it's not finished in 10 minutes, we're leavin' without it. - Hold it! - You leave Moldy's bike, you leave me. - Yeah, and me too, 'cause I'm not going anywhere else till I get some rest. - Me either. - Right. - [Marlene] Yeah, and some water. - You people are out of your gourds. You can't stay out here in this heat. - Well why didn't we stop in Good Springs like we all wanted to? - Yeah, whose fault is it that we're out here anyway? - Now just a minute-- - We should've stopped. - [Mother] What? - We're not gonna leave anything or anybody behind, just to-- - Just to what? - Just so we don't have to play your silly games! - Shut up, bitch. You poor, stupid clowns, you really don't know what's happening, do you? You can't stay out in this heat and let things happen, no way. We got a long way to go, and all you jive, lame mothers can do is bitch about how uptight you are and how hot you are. All right, it's a bummer about Moldy coming off. But that's the way it is. And the bike's gonna be all right, what's one day? What, are the ants gonna eat it? If we're gonna catch those punks at Devil's Head, we're gonna haul ass outta here starting yesterday. This is not a party. I don't know who put that idea in your space head. Oh man, this gang is loose. I feel like I come back to goddamned funeral. Now shut up! - Shut up? Shut up, that's all we have been doing is shutting up. We haven't been sayin' nothin'. You don't wanna hear nothin' from anybody but yourself, do you? Well that's fine, but look where that has got us. We haven't got any food, we haven't got any water. We haven't got any gas. Don't you know that Moldy is the second one to crash? How the hell do you think the rest of us feel out here in this desert, in this sand, in this heat? You just don't care about nothin' any more, now do you? You, you think, you think that you can put me on and then rip me off like your filthy clothes? You're wrong. You're wrong. Big Mother, ha! You're nothing. You're nothin'. You're nothing but a big, filthy, ugly, no-class good-for-nothing bastard! No, you don't have anything on your head, ow! (screaming) Ow! (screaming) - All right, bitch. All right, now this bitch is officially turned out. She's become the new mama for this here motorcycle gang. Mama Marlene. Anybody wants to get in on this little gang bang, you line up right here. What about you, Pete? Come on, man, get in here and get your thing wet. - [Pete] No. - [Mother] Come on, man, you're a big stud here. - No, man. - What about you, Animal? Come on, get in here and use your wrench, man. That's your favorite tool. - [Marlene] (wails) Oh God! (wails) - All right, come on, let's get it on! Come on, baby. - Ralph! Ralph! - Too much, man. You've gone too far this time. This is a club, not a mob. You seem to think you're the only one that's important around here. Beats me why you bothered to come back. Now we're gonna get to where we're goin'. And we're gonna do what we have to do, but not by throwin' our bikes or our women out. What do you think we are, a bunch of flipped-out hippies? Now you leave her alone, and you leave him alone, and you leave us alone. I think it's time you split. I love you, man, but you're on a bummer! Go work your hang-ups out on somebody else. - I'm the one that's hangin' this scene up, huh? I'm the one that's responsible for this gang being so loose? Well I've been away, in case my old lady didn't remind you, baby. I'm the one here, huh? (fly buzzes) - Jesus, get some gas and put it in his tank. - [Jesus] Moe, don't you have a gallon of gas in the three-wheeler? - [Moe] A gallon, si. - You freaks won't get 10 miles without me and you know it. - We'll take that chance. Now you've got almost a full tank. You get outta here, the way we came. And as soon as you get outta sight, man, what you do is your own business. We just don't wanna see you around here, or around us. (wind roaring faintly) (engine rumbling) (wind roaring faintly) (rock music) - Can you tell me where the mine is at Devil's Head? - Yep. - If I take this here road back to Shaffer, can I get there? - Well, depends on where the road is. Never can quite tell this time of year. - Now let's just say I can; how far out is it? - When old Mack rode up there on his horse-- - Hey, I'm not on a horse, man. - Took an hour or so, then again, if it rains... You go in the rain? - Can I get gas there? - Sometimes you can, sometimes they ain't. Well you see, it all depends on Charlie. (engine rumbling) Better get yourself plenty of water! It's mighty thirsty out there. Ain't seen Charlie in quite a spell. Could be dead, for all I know. (rock music) (engines rumbling) - Hey, what's happening? - It's that way, huh? - Yeah, it's up the road, but it sure is a hell of a lot shorter. - Yeah, but is that the road Mother said was a problem? - Yeah, we can make it. - Let's take the soft road. - Okay. - Yeah, let's get there. What do you say? - Okay. - Let's do it. - Come on, let's get it over with. (engines rumbling) (rock music) - You wanna fill her up? And I'm gonna need some water. Can I get some water around here? - Closed. - [Mother] Where's the head? - I said we're closed, it's past 12 o'clock. - [Mother] What do you mean it's past 12 o'clock? I need some gas, man. - I can't help you, you'll have to come back at three. - Now what are you talkin' about, old man? I got noplace else to go. - Sorry. - Yeah, well I'm sorry about it, too, but you're gonna pump me some of that gas. - Can't; pump's locked. - All right, old man, get your tail in gear and get over here and open that-- - No, no, now you keep away. We're shut, I tell ya, we're shut every day, 12 to three. I know your kind now, now, now keep away. I wouldn't hesitate to shoot. I'd shoot you down, just like I would a dog. That's what you are, dogs! With your smashin', and killin', and, and, and rapin'! Women, rapin' women. Dogs! (whimpering) Keep, keep away, don't come... Rapin' (moaning) women! (sobbing) (fly buzzes) (man sobs) (engine rumbling) (man sobbing) (rock music) (wind roaring faintly) (jaunty blues music) (clattering) (slow music) (clattering) (jaunty blues music) - [Cockroach] Godforsaken place, you can't even see a decent telephone pole. - Knock it off, Cockroach, you stick to your bugs. (laughs sarcastically) - I knew it was the wrong road. I knew we never should've headed straight west. I knew someone'd run out of gas. - Aw, cool it, Roach, that ain't gonna get us any gas. Just lay off, man, lighten up. - Hey Stash. - What? - Gimme a joint. _ I'm all out, man. - What? - I don't have any grass, man. Look, I got a couple tabes of I'll Be Blue. That'll get you on it, okay? - Hey, what kind of supply man are you? Got no grass. - Hey, look, man. Where are you? The borders were closed. I didn't score; now we're lucky to have what we have. You want some or not? - AH never mind, forget it. - Okay, Day Tripper. - Well, we might as well make ourselves at home. - Nice place to visit. - Oh, real nice place to visit. - Oh, Mother. - Hey, Fingers, how the hell we supposed to get some gas? - You tell me, bug-eater. - Hey, I didn't pick this stupid road. Even Mother wouldn't have gone this far off. - Yeah, yeah, and the sky's fallin' in too, Chicken Little. - Hey, Moldy. Hey, I think I'm losin' my mind, man. Take a look behind you. - I don't see nothin'. What are you talkin' about, Mouse? - [Mouse] No, man, look where I'm pointin'. There's what looks like a tanker comin', and I think he's comin' this way. Baby, I hope that's not a diesel. Shirley, babe, we gonna be able to fill your tank again. - Sure, Mouse, sure. (speaking faintly and laughing) - [Man] (speaking faintly) You're right, Mouse. (all clamoring faintly) (cheering and laughing) - [Man] That's beautiful! - Everybody-- - woo! (exclaiming and whistling) (rock music) (engine sputters) (wind roaring faintly) (fly buzzes) (engine sputters) (Mother sighs) (engine sputters) (fly buzzes) (trippy music) (distorted honkytonk piano music) (distorted whooshing) - [Man] You and me are through. - [Man] No, no, no, no. (groaning) (gunshots booming) (gunshot booming) (laughing) (Marlene imitates coyote) (flames crackle) - You okay? - I'm fine. No really, I'm okay. (groaning happily) (Mother sighs) - Jesus Christ, man, has everybody out here got a gun? - [Man In White] Yep. Anybody comes around to these parts should have a gun. - I don't dig it, man. I think we should go to Devil's Head tonight, while we're here. - You're crazy, man. That Vegas crowd, they know this place, and in the dark they'd have it over us. - You scraped me off the sand? - And your motorcycle. Pretty nice machine you got there. - Yeah, yeah, it's all right. Uh, you could probably tell me how to get to this mine, huh? - Yeah. (bluesy harmonica music) (blues music) - So they really thought they could outgun us. But Wyatt, see, he was a hell of a lot smarter than old man Quentin. That old man sure was a dumb-head. So Wyatt had that corral fixed up special, like I told you, see? But once they was in there, it was all over. - Wyatt Earp, huh? - Yeah. - You ever hear of a place called Bast Lake, old man? It's this place we used to go every once in a while. Drink a few beers, bust a few heads. We had the same kind of situation. These guys came out from the Midwest, Chicago somewhere. The reason they came out was like to see who was tougher, them or us. Of course we-- - Man, you know those guys showed no class at all. - Remember, remember when Moldy threw that big blond guy over the cliff into the lake? He was cryin' like a baby all the way down. - I hope it's that easy tomorrow, man. 'Cause you know, I been havin' bad vibes about this thing ever since we left LA. - Hey man, don't you worry 'bout that. No people from any dump like Vegas are gonna have any class at all. (kitten meows) - (Mother yawns) (clattering) (engine rumbling) (rock music) - [Man] Hey, they up here man? - [Man] Yeah, they're inside the place. They're crashed all over, man. - How many man? - I don't know, 10, 15 maybe. - Yeah, that's cool but-- - Let's go! - [Man] Yeah, okay. (mid-tempo rock music) (gunshot booming) (gunshots booming) - You all right, man? Hey man, put the scam on there. - [Man] She'll be okay. There's a gun up there, so for Christ's sake, keep your head down. - [Man] All right, man, if they're usin' heat, man, anything's fair, let's go.
