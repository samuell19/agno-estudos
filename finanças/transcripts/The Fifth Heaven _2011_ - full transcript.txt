A fiIm by Dina Zvi-Riklis Based on the Novel by Rachel Eytan "There are seven heavens in the sky. The fifth heaven is called "Ma'on", where classes of ministering angels recite poetry at night..." (Seder Mo'ed, Tractate Chagigah) Fifth Heaven August 1944 Palestina Eretz Israel under the British Mandate Wait here. Good morning, Mister. - Good morning. We don't have babies here. - Excuse me? We don't have boys here either. I'm not looking for boys. Girls, say hello to the new girl. You should have told us you came to dump, not to collect! They thought you came here to adopt. Not many come by here. Frieda Averbuch, head counselor. - Hermoni, nice to meet you. Wolfson sent us. This is Maya, my daughter. Nice place. This is the new girl. - Good morning, Markovsky, so good to see you. Told you there'd be someone here you know. What are you doing here? - Wolfson said it'd be okay. This is not for her, this is a home for abandoned kids. All her certificates... are here. Be a good girl. I'll come and get you after the holidays. Show Markovsky your stories. You get up each morning at 6. Breakfast's at 7. kitchen's downstairs. Pani (Ms.) Paula, the new girl. You study at the School down at the colony. No late arrivals, no absences. Afternoon you work in the fields and do homework. In bed by 9 sharp. No wandering around or opening windows at night, even though blackout was cancelled. Roof's off Iimits. That's your bed. Welcome. "Maya Hermoni. Born 1931, "Parents: Divorced. "Father works in the education system. Remarried. "His wife's worried the girl might hurt their newborn baby..." The Iittle ones have constant diarrhea. I told Pani Paula to take a break from lentiIs. Come, Malka. Let's examine you. There you go. Does your stomach hurt? Does it hurt here? They say you know the new girl. I know her father. We went to secondary school together. Does it hurt here? - She's very pretty. Does she have a mother? Her mother's abroad. - Abroad? Quite a luxury. That's it, Malka. You can have a seat. Give her rice for a few days. Worms. Can't get rid of them. Dov... My fianc'e has no where to stay. I wanted to ask if he can stay here a few days. He guards orange groves in this area. What's his name? His name's Yosef, but everyone calls him Duce. Duce... -He studied veterinary medicine in Italy. He came here because of the war. He's okay. Don't worry. Enough, Masha. Stop fidgeting. That's Masha. It's short for "mad hushed girl". She came from Europe... They tie her at night because she's sleepwalking. Her mother Iives in a madhouse. They wanted to take Masha to a madhouse too, but Dov wouldn't allow it. What's that? Nothing, it's a birthmark. Say, how do you get water here? - How? With your hands, Newgirl, between your fingers. I gotta go. Maya... come on. What's wrong? The "Queen" needs to pee. She needs an escort. Maya... Go on, Maya, go in with her. It's cold. - I'm freezing. Hey, Newgirl, why do you squeak when you pee? Hedva, it squeaked, didn't it? My ears hurt so I didn't hear well. - I heard it well. It sounded Iike she had a whistle inside her pussy. You stinking monkey girl! Who let you be here? And how could you hear Newgirl's pussy squeak if it didn't squeak? Fine, it didn't. "Once upon a time in a kingdom far away there was a Iittle girl, "a girl who belonged to nobody. "She traveled for many days untiI she reached a beautiful palace. "It reached the skies and was surrounded by golden wheat field. "In the palace's courtyard was a shining lake. "On its shores, beautiful princesses dressed as angels. "The girl knew that everything would be fine now." Cheers. Mr. Edwards, I would Iike you to meet Dr. Markovsky, a childhood friend of mine. - A pleasure. -Nice to meet you. He runs the orphanage up above. Mr. Edwards is a business man from London. He's here on a real estate business. Very big money. Mr. Edwards has a delightful idea. He's going to build the first toilet paper factory. There's a great deal of demand, the cities grow and people here... still wiping with the news of yesterday. -Michael! Sir. - Nice meeting you. Sit, Markovsky. Cigarette? - No, thanks, l have my own. An angel's cigarette! But the light's from the devil. So Markovsky, what are you short of this time? Are the girls hungry? What are you short of? Blankets? Clothes? You let Hermoni dump his daughter on me. When you were unemployed l got you this job. A friend in need, don't l help him? There are boarding schools, kibbutzim. This girl is not an orphan. What do you want me to do? He came here crying, said he can't look her in the eyes... That he thinks she mocks him. Like her pretty mother. So how's it going up there? Like l promised you, an Alpine view... Fresh air, pretty women... Wolfson, your mother hasn't sent us money in months. lt's about time! Maybe she finally listens to me. l told her we have to do something about that place. That land's very expensive. - ls money all you care about? lt's my inheritance. You know what they say, if you're a communist, you have a heart, and if you're a capitalist, you have brains. But my mother decided to be a philanthropist. Sania (Short for Alexander)... talk to you mother. Here... something for the New Year meal. Just don't say... l don't have a heart. A year went A year is coming l raise my hands Happy new year to you, Dad Happy new year to you, Mom Happy new year Happy new year. Happy new year. - Happy new year. Now eat! Whoever bangs once more doesn't get any chicken. We're eating chicken? There was an epidemic at the chicken coop... Girls, chew away at the bones. Lots of lime in them... Yeah, lots of lime in the pit outside too. l'd like to introduce... Dov, this is my fianc'e, Yosef, but everyone calls him Duce. Madam. l'll get you a plate. Happy new year. - Happy new year. Dov? No thanks, Frieda. Grownups also deserve a celebration from time to time. -Ah, well! Jews always need a religious excuse to stuff themselves. Say, Mr. Markovsky, are communists allowed to play cards? Only with a kingless and Queenless deck of cards. Duce... Smells like cats. -Oh really? What makes you an expert? Only in ltaly can one learn the true wisdom of dining. ltaly? Have you heard of French food? Paula was a head cook in a French restaurant in Warsaw. Mr. Mussolini, l wasn't born to be a housemother in an orphanage. Hard to believe, but l was the queen of Warsaw's nightlife. We had restaurants there, nightclubs, opera... And what do we have here? Only sand, stones and crazy people. Don't worry, once we kick the British out of here we'll have opera too. Let's say we kick them out, what's next? We'll kick the Arabs out too. Then we'll have a state. l can tell you grew up on Garibaldi's tradition. Duce, changed your mind? Cold cuts? Butter? Where did you come from? - Odessa. Russia... But he refuses to speak Russian. Why don't you enlist like everyone else? Because l'm a pediatrician and l don't like wars. The world's on fire and Doc's being spoiled. Communists always have a cure for what's going on in the world, right? Strikes, demonstrations... And at night, when they're tired of talking, they sit and write poems. - You're right... Poetry is a waste of time. lt's much simpler to pull out a gun and get things done. Mussolini, Stalin, enough! - You're ruining the evening. Maya... Maya... Now it's Maya's turn to tour the country. Come on. Climb up and draw the map on my back. Climb up here, you'll enjoy it. Do you know how to tour the country? Yes, but l'm not so good at it. Take your finger... Which finger? -"Which finger..." Take your finger and draw a line of the Jordan River along the spine. Now draw a line out west, of the Mediterranean sea. And the Sea of Galilee... The Hula Lake... And the Dead Sea... Further down... Even further down... Now draw a ship of illegal immigrants... From top to bottom... Further down, yes, further down... What do we have here? - The scar? That's from my stepmother. You're fine Bathsheba. The stepmother? Yes, my stepmother. She cut me with glass. l bled badly and my real mother took me to the hospital. And what happened? l nearly died. But you didn't. "Dear Anna, "had it not been urgent, l wouldn't have interfered in your new life. "l don't know if you had been informed that Hermoni "has brought Maya to the Home at the end of the summer and left her here. "l implore you to return ASAP and take her from here. "By the way... "she's very pretty and takes after you. "Best regards, Dov." Are you cold? We're out of hot water. That's how it is with the girls. Good night. Good night. Good evening, Bambina. What are you writing? Poems? Stories. Let me read some one day, will you? What's your name? - Maya. Maya... Taurus. The sign of heartbreakers. l'm Duce. Shoshana's boyfriend. How old are you, Maya? - Thirteen. And why do you live here? My parents died. Are you sad? Don't be sad. Soon the war will end and we'll have a state. Andiamo, now go back to bed. Maya... Don't tell anyone. What you've seen is our secret. Right? l was told you need a cleaning lady. Berta, right? Welcome! Lentils... Lentils every day! l spoke to the kibbutz, they'll send us jam. Black crow! (Orthodox Jew) That's the last thing we needed! lf she's religious, then l'm God. l heard that her parents wanted to marry her to an old Black Crow and she fled. Lucky the Crow didn't follow her here. We'd have another mouth to feed. The philanthropist lady thinks that we're birds as it is. She gives us crumbs and expects us to burp. Someone should tell Mr. Markovsky to stop taking in all the wretched. The days of Hanuka, the dedication of our temple Fill our hearts with joy and happiness Night and day our dreidels willspin We'll eat lots ofjelly doughnuts... There are no real men here. Markovsky's here. Markovsky... What does he know about women? His head's full of rubbish: what's right for this world, what's wrong for this world, it can kill a woman. Shoshana's Duce comes here sometimes. -He's just a boy. So what's a real man? Someone like my Major Jimmy. Someone who knows what women like. Say, Berta, why do all women want the British soldiers? Why? Because they say: "l love you, darling", "l love you, baby". "l love you, darling"... And that's something you understand without speaking English. Frieda said going out with the British is forbidden, so l won't. Don't worry Yafa (pretty), no one will even look your way. That's right, Monkey girl. Look what l found... "A severe warning to the daughters of lsrael. "Since young girls are dating British soldiers, "we approach these girl with a warning "and give them a chance to better their ways "before their heads will be shaved "and their names will be published on the pillory." Watch out, Berta, or they'll make you a baldy and hang your picture out there. - Nonsense! Do you know who wrote that? A bunch of ugly bald guys who want to lock young women in tiny rooms so we'd cook for them and caress them in bed. Don't worry, l won't stay much longer in this hellhole of piss and fleas! All the Friedas and Shoshanas will become green with envy when they see me in the most elegant venues in Tel Aviv. Not to mention London... What shall l get you? -Gum. - Chocolate. -A notebook. He's here. Yafa'le... Open the door and tell him nicely: "Welcome, please wait." Welcome, please wait. - Good. Welcome, please wait. Welcome, please wait... Hello, young lady. Happy new year. Here comes my little princess. Happy new year, love. What are you doing here? Come inside, quick! Welcome, please wait. Right now, Yafa! Am l intruding? No, no. Come in. You have to do something about Berta. She's going out with that British soldier in front of the girls! So what? The girls see it and think it's okay. So she's having a little fun, it's no big deal. lf the philanthropist lady hears what's going on here... Enough, l'll... l'll talk to her. No need to talk, you have to get rid of her. l can't get rid of her just like that. You know she has no where to go. Like all of us... Come on... Dov, no... Not like this. l don't want to do it like this. So what do you want? Just tell me. l don't know. Frieda... Some other time. Happy new year! Happy new year. 1945! Berta? Cloche. Jimmy bought it for me. l have an idea for the girls. How about l give them a beauty course? l'll teach them how to walk, how to dress. Have a seat. The girls really love you, Berta. Ever thought of becoming a kindergarten teacher? What have l done wrong, Markovsky? lt's about Jimmy... Thought so. lf l'd gone on a rendezvous with a Jew, you'd send me off to him with an orchestra. -That's not true. To me everyone's equal but if our philanthropist, Mrs. Wolfson, hears about your partying with the British, she'll stop giving us money. lt's no partying... After the war's over, Jimmy will get a divorce and get me out of here. He won't get a divorce, Berta. - You'll see he will. He loves me, all his friends know me already, everyone calls me "Lady Jim". He's lonely here and lonely men make all kinds of promises. How would you know? - You'd be surprised. l've had my share in these things. l was lonely. She was my best friend's wife. Really? That's nice, it makes you more... And what happened? She left you and broke your heart, huh? l don't want Jimmy coming here anymore. Understood? Sure. The President of the United States gave a speech on the radio yesterday. Who's the President of the United States? Bathsheba. What? Who's the President of the United States? Churchill. - Churchill! No, Bathsheba, Churchill is the British Prime Minister. Really, you should know these things. The president of the United States is Roosevelt and yesterday he said on the radio that the free world... Hi, Ze'ev, how are you? - Good, thanks. This is for you, from America. Thank you. - Goodbye. Hedva... Nira... Bathsheba. l'm sorry, Paulichka. Come on, girls. What... Nothing for me? No. "Dear Dr. Markovsky, "l got your letter dated October 1944. "Mrs. Hermoni departed many months ago "and did not leave a forwarding address. "l shall certainly keep you informed "if any new information comes to light." Maya, what are you doing here? - Nothing. -Maya... l'm looking for Frieda. This is not Frieda's room. The girls said that she's here with you sometimes. What? Let go of me. "The girl became a princess. "She left behind her sealed story and her loneliness. "ln the dreaming hours of the night, "she imagined herself flying on the wing of a bird "while the ministering angels fly around her and sing to her. "As she flew, she saw her beautiful mother walking "and she dove down and called her, but the mother walked away. "The angels smiled at the girl and promised her sweet promises. "Promised her she'd find love." Look at them. They don't let me go out with Jimmy but they fool around at night. l assure you Frieda's protecting her virginity and keeps her legs crossed. Berta? Yes. Can you read me what's written here? lt's in English. But you speak English. "l love you. My darling..." Ask Markovsky. l can ask Jimmy to read it. Really? - Sure... As soon as they let me run away from here. So, pretty girl... Have you got "it" already? What? - You know... Not yet. How old are you, Maya? - Thirteen. When l got my period my mother slapped me. Then she told my father: "Great, "now she'll start bringing bastards home." The Rhine River in Germany was conquered before sunrise under the command of GeneralMontgomery and Patton. The next target: Conquest of Berlin. On Ahad Ha'am St. in TelAviv, Major John Wilson was shot this morning. He was rushed to Hospital where he was declared dead. The "Lehi" Organization left a proclamation at the murder scene claiming responsibility for the terrorist act. Currently a search is conducted to track the attacker. Barbarians! They think killing a few British will solve everything. Black Crow!! Watch out for your Major! Quiet, you'll wake up the queen of Warsaw's nightlife. First, we'll have wedding ceremony with 3 couples on a boat on the Jordan river, to be followed by a dance in the dining hall. Why with more couples? Because it's a kibbutz. People live and get married together. And they die together... So, what do you say? Listen, Shoshi, if someone asks, l was here with you all day long. Ok, but what do you think? - About what? About the wedding, Duce. We have to inform the kibbutz's secretariat. Ok, we'll see, there's plenty of time till Pentecost. Everyone to the dining hall! Come on, everyone to the dining hall! Attention, attention. All the residents are requested to gather in one room immediately. You have two minutes to comply before we enter to inspect the premises. l'm sure it's nothing. Come. Let's go. What's wrong? What are you doing here? -Please move. This is an orphanage. - l am aware. What are you looking for? There's nothing here. A little bird told us that you built up a weapons store here. Right under the nose of the poor orphans. -What? Come on. The other sac. Come on, hurry up. There's nothing here sir. Let's move. Sorry l'm late. Frieda... Sonia... Let's go in, please. Be nice to him, will you? Shall we have a drink? Ever since they've invented whiskey, l'm happy. With vodka you end up in slime, with Cognac in bed and with scotch... in the fifth heaven. That's what you call your place up there, don't you? Cheers! - Cheers! l understand you've been paid a little visit... You knew about this? - l know everything. So why didn't you tell them they had nothing to search for? So they did a little search, what's the big deal? They help me out, l help them out. Your mother hasn't sent money in several months. The girls are hungry, Wolfson. No medication, no vaccines... Did you tell her to come crying to me? Really, Markovsky, l like nice legs but not when it comes to business. Alexander, please... - Why do you come to me? Go to the Jewish Agency, go to rich Jews. So many people you could ask... Everyone here lives off donations. Just whimper and you get some. Really, why bother work? Yes. Hermoni! How are you? Yes, tonight at 9 at the Oasis. Goodbye. ls his daughter still with you? Her pretty mother's still in America. She doesn't care, huh? Both you and Hermoni don't know how to hold on to pretty women. Stop that nonsense. l'm having a party at my club tonight for some contractor l work with. He's hosting a group of rich Jewish Americans. Sorry, we have to get back, we can't stay. Why not? Come. Maybe they can help you. Hermoni will be there too. Do come... Make sure he doesn't give you a night shift. Last time l saw you in a suit was at your Bar Mitzvah. Me too. So how is Maya? What do you care how she is? You don't write her, you don't visit her, you don't pay for her. You said you'd come get her after the holidays. l'm working like crazy, Markovsky. l'm constantly on the road. Besides... Regina's pregnant again. Get her out of there. l can't. But at least l give you a chance for atonement. lt's not the girl's fault! You know what's the problem with that girl? She has her mother's beauty and her father's shitty personality! Don't argue. There are enough pretty women for everyone. l arranged a visit of benefactors for you. Now if you'll be nice to my mother, maybe she'll open her wallet again. That will keep you going for a while. Shall we have a drink? Thanks, l have to go. Good night. Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen, we have a surprise for you tonight, an English song contest. Palestine's loveliest ladies are going to perform to our soldiers songs from home. And the first contestant for tonight is Lady Jim. Please give her a warm welcome. Berta, Berta, Berta... God Save the king. And now l will sing the song: "Yes, my darling daughter". A chap from New York has written to Markovsky that Mrs. Harmoni has left without leaving a forwarding address. Who's Harmoni? - Hermoni. And also he writes that he was... Very sad to hear about the girl that was taken to an orphanage... Do you know the girl? Never mind. Thank you, Jimmy. What is it? Are you upset? The war is almost over, Jimmy. What will happen to us? We shall have to see what happens. You said you'd tell your wife goodbye and then we'd be together. l should tell my wife goodbye then. And then we'll be together? - Of course. ln London? ln London or wherever you'd like. Jimmy... - Yes. l am... l love you so much. Berta... What did Jimmy say? - About what? About the letter. The letter... -lt's from my mother in America, isn't it? Yes, it's from your mother. She wrote that she loves you and she'll come get you soon. She did? Then why did she write in English? -l don't know. Excuse me, you're in my way. Berta... - What now? We had a deal, didn't we? You can't imagine the scene Mrs. Wolfson made. l'm sorry, you can't stay here anymore. You can't do this to me, Markovsky. Nothing l can do. -Markovsky, l promise l won't go out at night anymore. Please don't kick me out, l have no where to go. -Go back home. l can't go back home, they'll kill me. Please, Markovsky, don't kick me out. l'll be a good girl. Promise. Please, Markovsky, l've no where to go. Please, Markovsky! l'm begging you. Enough, Berta. - Please, Markovsky... Berta, enough! You can stay here a few more days and that's it. l'll go home with you. l'll talk to your parents. lt'll be okay. You're a bad man, Markovsky! You have a black heart! Now we'll quickly plant the branches, water them and we'll have a garden. But it won't grow. - Sure it won't. Think l'm stupid? But at least today we'll have a garden. The guests from America will come, see the garden and say: "How nice!" And we'll get some money. Welcome, Mrs. Wolfson. Hello, hello. - Welcome. -Thank you. Welcome. Welcome to our little Home. - Thank you. Please. Thank you. Welcome to our humble abode, dear visitors from abroad! From far away lands you come to give a hand to the weak, to the poor, to the orphan. Welcome, welcome to our humble home today! Bravo! Bravo! No roots! No roots! Berta, what are you doing? Berta! -No roots. Let go of me! - Berta, stop! Stop, Berta! -Let go of me! - Berta, what are you doing? Think you'd dump me and l'd keep my mouth shut? Berta, what are you doing? Enough! -Get away. Look at the communist! - Berta's going to die! Teaches us how to lead our lives... - Enough. And sleeps with married women! - Enough! With the wife of his best friend. Ask him! -Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! What have you done to yourself, Berta? Why didn't you tell me? Why? "A sever warning to the women of lsrael... "This girl was punished for going with British soldiers... Berta Levi" What happened between you and Hermoni's wife? Nothing. l don't believe you. lt was many years ago, why do we have to discuss it now? Did you love her? What's wrong, Frieda? l deserve someone who really loves me. l offer you a lot of love. l don't want to live this life. What life? This pathetic life. When the war's over, Frieduchka, everything will change. l can't! -What? - l can't be with you. -Why? lt'd be a lie. Of course! l should have guessed... l saw Wolfson and you at the club. - You asked me to be nice to him. Yes, but l didn't know you'd take the task so seriously! Why him? ls it the money? Of course not. l know him. He'll use you and dump you like he does with all his women. When l get married l'll have a tap with soap water in my backyard and anyone who wants can come blow bubbles. You'd better have a tap of raspberry soda too. Or a tap of honey water. A tap of magic would be best. You touch it with your wedding ring and say: "Magical tap, tap of magic, give me raspberry soda by the..." "By the gallons!" Exactly. When we come visit, will we be allowed to drink out of the tap too? -Sure. Come every Saturday and you'll get everything. We'll eat all day and have so much fun. Me and Hedva and Nira and Maya... know why you won't come, monkey girl? Because you'll already live with me and my husband. know what you'll do in our house? You'll be our maid. Bathsheba! Happy Passover. Enjoy the vacation, gals. Maya still here? Her father's supposed to pick her up. -Sure... And the Messiah's coming too. Ask for new shoes. And don't come back without your father's money! You hear? Need a ride home? lt's not where we're headed. - We'll take a little detour, right, Bambina? You'll ride in the sidecar. Happy Passover, Markovsky! - Happy holiday. Happy holiday. - Have fun. Andiamo. Hold tight. Why don't you tell your father anything? Are you mad at me? - No. Then why are you all clammed up? Tell me something. What's your life like? What are you studying? You think l don't worry about you? Think the pampered girls that study piano are better off? Have you received a letter from my mother? You ask about her? The woman who deserted you and disappeared? You should be grateful for what you have. lnstead, you complain. - l'm not complaining. They say life's a bargain. lt comes by cheap but later you pay a heavy price for it. You'll understand when you grow up. They said l should tell you to pay the Home. Explain to them that l have no way to pay. They'll have to wait. -Markovsky told me not to return without the money. Oh, he told you that? - Yes. Then go back there and tell him he should pay. Got it? Go back there and ask him exactly what... -Regina, enough! She needs to know the truth. - Hush... l didn't know it was your first time. l was sure you and Markovsky have already... So he isn't over her yet, huh? Over who? Hermoni's first wife. The mother of the girl with the name of the month. Maya? She was a real beauty. Do you know you look like her? Didn't he tell you about her? Markovsky doesn't like to talk about himself. lt was quite a scandal! Markovsky with his friend's wife. Hermoni, Markovsky and l used to be best friends. When the child was born, all hell broke loose. Hermoni kicked his wife out. Markovsky wasn't into a wife and kid and... She left everything and went to her relatives in America. What about the girl? - Hermoni raised her. Markovsky never forgave himself. He could have been... a renowned professor today with a private clinic... Look what's become of him... A kindergarten supervisor. Who's the girl's father? l don't know. No one wants to be, that's for sure. Frieduchka... Why don't you leave "The Fifth Heaven"? l offer you the seventh heaven here. Come to me. l'll get you a job, l'll rent a nice little room for you. We'll have fun. What do you say? Maya? Why did you come back? What's wrong? They wouldn't let me in. - What? l walked the streets all night. They said they don't have money and that you need to buy me shoes. Never mind. l'm glad you're here. lt's so quiet here. Come, l'll fix you something to eat. l don't want to grow up. l don't want to grow up. Story. Story. Enough, Masha. Leave me alone, l'm tired. Story... All the girls got their periods. We have to get more sheets. lt's nice that Duce volunteered to replace Frieda. At least he'll stay here and won't keep disappearing. When the war ends, Duce and l will get married and go to ltaly. He'll finish his veterinary medicine studies. Good, Shoshi'le... l'd love to see that! So much lice! - Crap! Maybe we'll sell our lice we'll fill up our money box. The Queen's coming back from holiday. - Bathroom Queen. Maya, watch your mouth. lf she hears you... -l don't care. l don't care either. - May Queen Filth burn. Let's see her try to command us, we'll show her. What will we do? - A ban. Don't talk to her and don't answer her. Gals... Wait till you see the presents l brought you. Don't talk and don't answer. This is for Hedva... This is for Nira... And this for... -Really, Bathsheba? Wonderful! And for Maya. l even brought a little something for Monkey girl. What did you bring me? l'm so happy for you, Bathsheba! Come on. Let's help Bathsheba pack. She's moving to her uncle's. Wonderful... Come on. Maya, you can have my bed, if you want. Wonderful! When l was a little girl, l thought crickets were the sounds stars make. What did you say, Bambina? Crickets. Each time a star twinkles, it chirps. Don't point at the stars, they say it'll make your fingers grow warts. Remember our secret? You didn't tell anyone, right? Would you like to dance? Look at me. You're so pretty. lf l were your father, l wouldn't sleep at night. l don't have a father. Six years... lf you could only skip six years... ln six years... you'll have gray eyes and long honey colored hair. But then you'll find a guy your age and l'll look at you with envy. Don't look at me like that, as if you understand something. You still don't understand a thing, you're just a little girl. - l'm not a little girl. Not at all. Want to try? Come here. Feel it... What are you doing here? l let her stay, she had a question about the stars. Go downstairs, right away. From now on, the roof's off limits, got it? Yes, sir. l'd kick you out of here long ago if it wouldn't break Shoshana's heart. l don't know what you're talking about. Markovsky... You know that we can build a weather vane on the roof. We'll save electricity. Monkey girl? Monkey girl! lt's your turn to draw the map. No, l'm tired. Come on, get on my back and draw a map of the world. l'm tired... Come on. All the countries. This is Russia and this is Germany. Further down... More... Yes, there... And where's ltaly? Here? Further up. Yes... And America? Now do a train from the North Pole to the South Pole.
