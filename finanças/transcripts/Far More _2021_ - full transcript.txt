- So, purgatory is like a way station then, is that it? - It's a place where the soul goes to purify before moving on to heaven. - Okay, then I just have one more question for you. What does one have to do to be truly evil? Like, like so evil, you'd go straight to hell? You're probably gonna say kill someone, right? If you kill someone, you go straight to hell, just, just automatically. - Son, we've been talking for a while now and I want to help, but maybe you should tell me the reason you're here. - The reason I'm here? Well, my family is Presbyterian, but we don't go to church because honestly it's just not a very satisfying religion. So I'm thinking of becoming Catholic. I just kind of want to know what I'm getting into. And for me, the whole idea of an afterlife is very appealing. - Presbyterians believe in heaven and hell. - Well, yes, but not purgatory. I like the idea that if you mess up, you, you go somewhere and, and do whatever to make up for it. And then you go to heaven. I just kind of want to know what would constitute truly evil. 'Cause for me, truly evil is kind of a game changer. What would you have to do that would make you skip purgatory altogether and go straight to hell or even worse, go to purgatory hoping you get to go to heaven, but then get sent to hell? - Have you done something you want to tell me about? - No. Would you say killing someone would be truly evil? - Have you killed someone? - Of course not. But what if I had? Would, would I just go straight to hell or over to God? Look at the extenuating circumstances and understand the situation and I'd go to purgatory for a while, but then I'd still get to go to heaven. - Remember the commandments, "Thou shalt not kill." - Right, but what if someone was about to kill your mother and you had to make a choice, kill him or let him kill your mother? There's, there's really no choice, now is there? You have to kill him. Now, I say that's a purgatory, heaven situation.

I can't talk to him when he's on that. - It's good to stay ahead of it. All right. - Where's Eli? - He's at the bowling alley with your dad. He's keeping stats for the tournament. - He told me, said the cup is as good as ours already. Play me something. - I can't believe you had that thing brought in here. - Music, you, one and the same to me. - Well, it used to be, you could count on your sports seasons in this country. Now you've got fall, baseball, soccer, which never quits and now lacrosse squeezing itself in wherever it can. I mean are we even in America anymore? - You know it's an Indian game? - What, lacrosse? - Uh-huh. - Oh, let me guess, we stole it from them. You know sometimes I think you take that whole, my grandmother was an American-Indian thing a little too far, Evie. - McAllister Sports. - Oh, hey Hal. Sure. - Hey, Hal. What? What, no, no, I know he's your son-in-law, Hal, but does he even bowl? Okay, okay. Well how bad is Jesús? All right. Yeah, no, I'm fine with it. I'll see you there. - What, what happened? - Jesús sawed off the tips of his middle and his index finger on a job. On his bowling hand no less. He's in a cast for three weeks, right before the Fiesta Cup. Thanks, Jesús. Thanks. Thank you. I'm sure he didn't mean to. - Oh come on, even on his best day Jesús could never replace Rick, but I thought, you know, maybe we might still have a shot, but now we've got Hal's son-in-law who bowled a little in high school. - The physicist? - Yeah. - He works for Defense, doesn't he? - So he can build a bomb, doesn't mean he can bowl. - I'm sorry. - No, I just feel bad for Eli is all. I gotta go. Eli's meeting me at the alley. You know, he's great at keeping stats, that kid. Not much of an athlete though. - You know, Sean's probably at Rick's, you wanna stop by there first? - No, Eli will be waiting for me. - Hey, wait a minute. Have a good practice. - Ah. - Where you going, midget? - I, leave me along, Wolf. - You gonna stop me? - Like that's gonna happen. - I already did your math homework. - And I was thinking, maybe you could write my history report. - What, that's due tomorrow. - Yeah, you better hurry. - There's no- - Hey. I told you to go to the store. I'm going, - Who's this? - Just a friend from school. - You got a name? - Eli McAllister, sir. - Ain't I seen you around a bowling alley? - I keep stats for my grandpa's bowling team. - Dick McAllister's your grandpa? Yes, sir. So that means your dad's Rick McAllister. - Yes, sir. - Man, your dad and grandpa used to kick our asses in the Fiesta Cup. You know, I went to high school with your dad. - I didn't know that. - What the hell are you still doing here? Go. It's a fucked up world, kid. - I, I'm sorry, sir? - Your dad, a decorated war hero and a hell of a ballplayer, gets sick. Your freaking uncle makes more money than God. Give your dad my best. And tell your grandpa we're gonna take the cup off his hands this year. - You threw it over my head, dude- - Hey, Sean. ♪ Hey, ho ♪ - Okay, mister big shot over here. - Okay, everybody calm down. - No, no, no, no, sorry, you're not old enough. - Neither are you.

Glenn set up a room for you. Right here. You're a much better looking in person. - What? - The "GQ" article. Pictures don't do you justice. - Thanks. Is Glenn here? - Yeah, she's with your brother. Come on. When was the last time you saw your brother? - A while. - Well cancer is fairly advanced, so he's pretty distressed physically, okay? - Sean. I'm so glad you came. He's on a morphine drip. We also, and Ana's giving him more right now, so he sleeps. Pretty much sleeps most of the day. - What the doctor say? Nothing good. I've been talking to some people at Sloan. They said there's experimental drugs. - No, no, no. No, no more doctors. It's just he would have been so much better if he hadn't done the chemo. - I thought he wasn't- - He wasn't. I mean, the doctors even told him, you basically have no hope, but you know him. He's always ready to fight. So, how's life across the pond? - It's good. - Sorry that Rick's friends move that piano in here. And it's usually a dresser and a TV and sorry it's a mess. - It's good. - Good. - It's good. - So we saw the article in "GQ" and he was really proud. And Eli too. Yeah, so have you, have you, have you talked to your father? - No, just Evie. - Yeah, Evie's been really great. She's been helping so much. - How are you? - I'm good, I'm good. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. - And Eli? - Yeah, he's as good as can be. Yeah, your dad's really been great. I might just wish he, you know, your dad stopped coming to see Rick. - What? When? - This last week. I know he did it with your mom, remember? And Rick doesn't really say anything, but. - I'll talk to my dad. - I'm so glad you're here. He's gonna be so happy to see you. Sean's here. - I thought you said he played in high school. - Just give him a chance. - At least he hit a pin this time. - Yeah. Hey, maybe I could play? - No, rules or rules, kiddo. Are you hungry? Here, go get us a couple of burgers. - We're gonna head out now. We'll come tomorrow at lunch and see if we can't make any progress, right Ben? - Some mechanism of the wrist that I just can't seem to get. - I'm gonna show him some of my videos. - Watch Earl Anthony. He was a southpaw too. - Still, Dick Weber was the best. - Please, in what universe? - Are you kidding? Weirdo Anthony couldn't touch Webber. - I'd say Earl's record speaks for itself. And I would take a nerdy weirdo over a showboat any day of the week, Hal. - Well don't worry, I'm usually able to master concepts very quickly. Come on, a guy like you, a piece of cake. Well, we'll see you tomorrow. - Got burgers. You still think we can win? - Oh yeah. Yeah, if Hal and I are on our game on Saturday, we can carry old Ben. The most important thing is that you don't- - We don't give up. - That's right. That's right. - Was my dad a good bowler when he was my age? - Oh yeah. Yeah. He was very athletic when he was young. He, I mean, even then he, your dad could do any sport at all. - And uncle Sean, what was uncle Sean like? - He was different. He was quiet. Your dad had to watch out for him. Ella used to say that Sean was Rick's baby. - Grandma, Ella? - Yeah. Uncle Sean's flying in today. - Come on, eat up. - Hey. How you doing? It's bad. Okay. - Where are you from, Ana? - Lovely Newark, New Jersey. - What brought you here? I needed a change a pace so I started traveling a little bit. - And you ended up here. - Yeah, I like it here. People are nice, the air is clean. It's quiet. And it has the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen. And there was a guy, I guess you could say I came for the guy, but I stayed for the sunsets. - My mom used to make Sean and me sit with her wave goodbye to the sun when we were little. - That's your mama? She's very beautiful. - Sometimes I hear her calling me. - How long ago did she pass? - Six years ago. - Uncle Sean. - Hey. Wow, you've gotten so big. Thanks. - Dad. - Sean. - When'd you get here? - This afternoon, there was a big car accident on the road and took awhile. Where, where are you guys coming from? - A bowling alley, grandpa's got the Fiesta Cup on Saturday. - Hal still playing? - Oh yeah. Oh yeah. - And Hal's son-in-law, Ben. - Oh, really? How's he? - He's a disaster. - He's not so bad. - Come on, he's almost as bad a bowler as your uncle here. - Let's go see my dad. - Anyway, I gotta go. No, I gotta go, I gotta pick up Evie and then close up. So. - But. - No, no, I'll be back later, with Evie. Yeah, listen, good job keeping those stats, kiddo. It's important. Well, listen, I gotta go, see you later, okay? - He never stays. - Yeah, I mean, he's just. So, Eli, are you bowling in the tournament too? - Nah, I can't, kids aren't allowed. - Oh. You know my dad, Hal, and grandpa won it five years in a row, before my dad went to Iraq? - Yeah, well they were always good bowlers those three. - Are you as bad as he said you are? - Actually, bowling is my best sport, which isn't saying much. - Do you wanna go see my dad? - Sure. - Oh, uncle Sean, would you mind not telling my dad that Ben's not a good bowler? - Of course. Come on. - So, you know, this is difficult for everybody, but- Hey, Dick. - Dan. - I, just getting some talc, getting ready, you know? You're still in the tournament? - Of course I am. - Great. Charlie was talking about maybe stopping by to see Rick tomorrow. - Great. - Yeah. There you go. See you Saturday. - All right. - My best to Cora. - Yeah. She's in Phoenix. - What was that look for? - Rick can't stand Charlie Kornfelder. He had to play ball with that idiot for four years. Way to go, Evie. - He asked about Rick. People wanna say goodbye. This is happening and it's awful and it's heartbreaking, but it's happening and you can't- - What, Evie? What can I do? - I'm gonna go see Rick, do you wanna come? - I have to finish up here. I like this one when mom had dark hair. - Here's mom with John's neighbor, that crazy old lady with one eye. What was her name, Ms. Ramirez? Oh man. "You boys are gonna go to hell." - That's right. - What was her dog's name? - Frankie. - Frankie. They kind of looked alike, too. Remember she caught us bombing cars? - What happens? - Yeah. So, your dad and I and John were bombing cars with oranges and one of the cars swerved and clipped her fence. And so we were trying to run and get away and Ms. Ramirez comes out and sees us. - You were the only one she saw. - You ran away and left me. Yeah. What happened? - Your dad and John were faster than me. So I had to run up, climb a tree to get away. And I stayed in the tree until dad came to get us. What did grandpa do? - Yelled, a lot. - I got a whooping. - Did you? - Dad took the fall, said it was his idea. Was it? - Probably. - Hi, it's cozy in here. I'm Evie. - Um. - It's okay. - Nice to finally meet you in person. - Nice to meet you. Hello, sweetheart. - Hey guys, I'm sorry to intrude. I just want to get this nice and get him through the night. Glenn, you can give him more of these pills if he wakes up in pain, okay? - Can we just give him a lower dose? I mean, it's just been so long since we've all been together like this. - It doesn't work like that. - Actually, it's way past someone's bedtime. - I don't wanna go to bed. - Come on, go with Evie, sweetheart. It's a school night. - I don't wanna go to school. - We've talked about this before. Come on. I'll tell you a story, a short one. - Your stories are never short, Evie. - Yes I can. - Where do you wanna put it? - By your medals. - I love you, kiddo. - I love you too. And will you come tuck me in? Yes, in a few minutes. Oh, take your sweatshirt. - Oh. Uncle Sean. - Goodnight. - Long ago, they were two sisters, Blue Dawn and Dancing Wind, her younger sister. One day, their mother told them to get their baskets and go fill them with pinions for the coming winter. She warned them, "Come home before dark and do not cross the river." Well, they couldn't find that many pinions near the Puebla. So they wandered further until they came to the river. On the other side of the river, they saw trees full of pinions and Dancing Wind said their mother would never find out if they crossed the river and filled their baskets. Blue Dawn tried to assist, but she couldn't. So they walk down the river till they found some rocks where they could cross. Then they started picking as many pinions as they could. Soon their baskets were full of pinions and they decided to go home. On their way back, the sun began to fade behind the mountain and it became very, very dark. They couldn't find rocks to cross the river and they began to cry. Raven heard their cries and he flew down beside them. He told them he would carry them across the river. But in exchange, he asked for one of the baskets of pinions. Then Raven grabbed Blue Dawn and flew her across the river. He returned to Dancing Wind. He picked her up and began to cross the river but high in the sky, above the river, he stopped. And he said, "Why don't you give me that basket? I'll carry it in my beak." The little girl refused and Raven became so mad he let go of her. And she fell far, far, far down into the land of the Night Sky where true to her name, she danced along the wind until she found a star she could grab a hold of. Far down below, she heard her sister calling to her. "Come back, come back." And she began to sob. The star asked her, "Why are you crying?" And she told him what had happened and how much she missed her family and how she wished she had listened to her mother. The star took pity on her and he flew her back down to Earth and landed her right beside her sister. Now it's time to go to sleep. - Tell me the rest, Evie. Tell me about the star. - When Dancing Wind went into the land of the Night Sky, she went where souls go when they die. - Your grandmother told you? My grandmother told me that when you see a falling star, it's a soul coming back to Earth, getting a second chance. - So then my guy evolved to a Charizard, which has like 250 HP. He's, he's like a, he's a fire type, he's a great, a great Pokémon. - Yeah, well, the world of Pokémon, I know nothing about. You better get going. - Evie's not here. - She's not? - I'll stay with Rick. You go ahead. - No, Evie takes him. - You go to the school that we went to, right? - Yeah. - Well I think I know how to get there. Go get your stuff. - Eli. I'll be here when you get back, okay? We'll play Pokémon. - Okay, love you. Love you mom. - Love you. - I'll be back. So you like school? Sixth graders are assholes. Did you like school? - No. Too many assholes. - How come you never came to see us? - I came to see you. - Six years ago, when grandma died. I was five. - My business took off and, I don't know. - Mom told Evie you didn't come because of grandpa. - Oh yeah? - Do you believe in hell? - Ah, no. But then again, I don't really believe in the afterlife or God. - Why not? Um, I don't see any evidence for it. - Energy is neither created nor destroyed, merely transformed, first law of thermodynamics. - Meaning? - Meaning that if you think humans are energy, like I do, they transform at death. They, they don't just disappear. - Huh. You may have a point there. - Do you like designing women's clothes? - I design for men too, but yes, I do. - Do you have to sew? - Uh, no, I, I just come up with the ideas, other people sew. - Mom hasn't change clothes in like a week. She doesn't play piano anymore. She used to play for me before bed. - Good morning guys. How did we do through the night, huh? - He's okay. - Yeah? You didn't have to give him too many pills? - None. He was okay. - I'm gonna give you something now. Glenn, you know where the morphine is? - What? No, you were the, you were the last one to give him the injection, right? I. Was on the, it was on the table. - Uh, Eli. Your mom is going through a tough time. If you need to talk. - Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm late for school. I, I should go. - Eli, hey Eli. Uh, I'll pick you up from school. Oh, no that's okay. - Well, no, I, I'd like to. Two o'clock? - Three. Yeah, what's up, bro? Yeah. - Sean? Sean McAllister? - Hi. - Oh my God, it is you. God, you're still gorgeous. - Thank you, uh. - Nan, Nan, come over here. - Oh, oh my gosh, Sean. Just, wants to be her pants. - That's crazy. - Oh my God, you don't remember me, do you? We were cheerleaders. - Ready. Okay. You can do it, that's okay. You can do it in any way. - Yes. - Class. - Right? - Remember? - Yes, oh. Hey, I'm so sorry to hear about Rick. I mean he survives Iraq, now this happens. Yeah, Mike's gonna go see him later. - You know I gotta grab this. - Oh, sure, yeah. - Please. - Sean, this is Ana. I was wondering if you could swing by the pharmacy and pick up your brother's prescription. - Yeah, I gotta, I gotta get going. - Oh, okay. - Okay. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. Yeah. - See ya. - See ya. - Ooh, God, he's gorgeous. - And uber successful. - He's gay, right? - Yeah, I think so. - Bummer. - So remember, nocturnal emissions or wet dreams as they are often called are a healthy, normal part of a maturing boy's life. Okay. Any questions? Tyler? - How do you get an erection at night? Have a nice weekend. - Nocturnal emission, where's my history paper? - I, I didn't have time. - Do you wanna die? - Leave him alone, Wolf. - Who's gonna stop me, four eyes? We have an arrangement. Don't we, Eli? Don't we? - No. No, Wolf, I don't think we do. I think I'm just staving off the inevitable. At some point you're gonna cream me. But ya know what Wolf? You're gonna fail at everything. And not because you're stupid, but because you're not stupid enough. If you were more stupid, you'd be nicer because being stupid wouldn't bother you. But you're smart enough to know you're stupid. Which makes you mad and scared. Which makes you mean. Any way you look at it, you're screwed. Hey, get off him, Wolf. Go to the office. Go. - You're dead. - Everybody go to class, there's nothing to see here. What happened? - Nothing. - Eli, I know your family is going through a rough time right now. Would you like to go home? - No, my mom thinks it's best if I come to school. Is there anything I can do for you? - I'd just like to go to class. Okay. - Hey. Thank you so much for taking Eli to school, my alarm didn't go off. - No problem. I was just picking up Rick's medication down the block so I thought I'd stop in. - Great, thank you. I'll go get your dad. - No, I can find him. - Of course you can, sure. - Dad? You tell me what happened. - Nothing happened. - Don't you lie to me. - Dad, please. - What did that coach see? What do you think, he's just making this up? - Who was with you, Sean? - No one. - God almighty, what you do reflects on our family. I'm not gonna tell your mother and don't you either. Don't you tell anyone, you hear me? Well this is a surprise. - I was just picking up Rick's medication, stop by. - John got that scholarship to Northwestern and your brother got into the Naval Academy after that game. - I remember. - You know, John's thinking about running for mayor of Los Angeles? - I didn't know that. - Yeah. So, how's England? - It's good. - Good. I have to unload some golf balls. - I'll help you. - I'm gonna go take Glenn some lunch, you guys okay? - No, we're fine. - Okay. - Do you mind bringing this to Ana? - Of course. I'll see you after bowling practice. - Evie seems nice. - Yeah. - Store hasn't changed at all. - Ain't broke, why fix it? - Dad? You gotta see Rick. Glenn says you haven't been there in a week and you just gotta go. - You know, that's rich. You telling me I need to go see your brother. Let me ask you something, Sean, where the hell have you been for the last six years? Or for that matter, the 16 years before that? - I don't think there's much time. - Oh really? Oh you don't? You know, I don't know what I'd do without you and Evie breathing down my God damn neck. I was here when your brother got the diagnosis and I have been here every day since helping his son, your nephew, who you have seen what, maybe three times his entire life. - Not about me, Dad. - It's not? - It's not about me. You did the same thing when mom got sick. - Don't you dare bring up your mother to me. I held your mother's hand as she drew her dying breath. - That's because Hal made you. You would barely go near the room. - You broke her heart, Sean. You never even came back to see her. You never came back after all she did for you. - I never came back because you didn't want me to, dad. Come on. Why don't you fucking tell the truth for a change? I mean, you could barely look at me after that night. And the last two years I was here, I felt like- - The last two years. Dear God, Sean, I knew what you were long before that. - Go see Rick, okay? Go see your son. - What you do reflects on our family. - Okay? Um, would you excuse me for a second? Hello? - Hey. You okay? No. - Your brother? - Ah, no, no it's, I don't know. - Sean what's wrong? - I had a little fight with my father and. - What happened? - It's, it's really nothing. Yeah, it's so complicated. - Yes it is. It shouldn't have to be. Listen, Sean, I can't do this right now. I know that you're in so much pain and we can't talk about it. I can't be there with you while you're going through it. So what exactly am I meant to do? - Devon, my family, my- - Sean, don't you think it's time to be the person you really are? I'm sorry, that was. Um. I, I've got to go. - Yeah. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Glenn. - John. I'm so glad you came. Oh, Rick, look who's here. The morphine, here. So, are Mercedes and the girls with you? - Yeah, yeah, they're at my mom's getting settled. - Ah, yeah. - Oh, here. Let me show you. Look at that. - Oh wow, they're gorgeous, like their mother. And Manny. - Oh no, no, no. We don't call him Manny now. No, it's Manuel. - I still can't believe you had him your freshman year at college. - Yeah, yeah, well, when we went all the way, we really went all the way. - Mercedes' mom tells me you're running for mayor. - I'm thinking about it, yes. - Wow. Mayor of Los Angeles. Well, we'll see. We'll see. Hey, how's Eli? - He's holding up. - Yeah? - Yeah. - This, it's from when they went camping, in August. Two months ago? - Yeah. Yeah. It's that way with pancreatic, it's, um, fast. And then the chemo just kind of. - He looks just like Rick. I think he looks just like Sean at that age. - Yeah, I guess he does. Hey how's Sean? Is he here? - Yeah, yeah, he's at the store with Dick. You know, I hope they're getting along, you know? I gotta pee. - Oh, go, go, go. John. - Hey buddy. - What are you doing here? - Oh, I came to see you. You look like shit. - We had fun. - Yeah, we did. - Excuse me. The matinee started 20 minutes ago. - No, no. I'm looking for a little boy, 11 years old. Dark hair, backpack, red hoodie. Eli. - Yeah, Eli. Uh, he's my nephew. - Oh, well he had an appointment with our spiritual leader, Guru Sai. It was originally for later today, but he moved it up. - Spiritual leader? - Our center is upstairs above the theater. I believe Eli has joined Guru Sai for lunch. - Garcia. - Hey. - How the hell are you doing? - Well, you know, good to see ya, man. How are ya, buddy? Hey, how you doing? Good to see ya. Guys, I gotta make a quick call. I'll be right back, okay? - Okay. - Absolutely, absolutely now believe that we are of many lives that we- - Uncle Sean, what are you doing here? - Oh, that's funny. I was just gonna ask you the same thing. - I had an appointment. - That you moved up, yes, I heard. You're supposed to be in school. - Eli's graced me with this company for lunch while I help him with his school project. - It's for social studies. - Really? Come, please join us. - I think we should get going. - I'm not going back to school. - Today's lentil dahl day and I doubt if you've had any better, Mr. - McAllister, Sean. - Another bowl for Eli's uncle. Come. - Very well. - I get the ball, right? I turn, and there he is. Bam. - Yeah, it's always me. Right, it's my fault we ran- - Blue is left, Red is right, it was Blue 32. - Yeah, you never know 'cause you always run the wrong way. - It was Blue 32. Two hold. - Please, Rick, listen to this guy right now. And then we go crashing into each other. You're on you back. - You were supposed to run it out and I- - I swear to God, you're still seeing Tweety Birds. - Come on, I just go long. - Hey, guys, excuse me, I'm just gonna sneak in here and give him his meds, okay? - Yeah, we should probably go. - No. You don't have to leave. I mean, we're having such, such a pleasant time. - Hey it's okay, I, I can come back tomorrow. What time's good? - Any time's good. - Okay. - Good to see ya, nice to see you. - Ah, thank you. - Love ya, honey. - Okay, bye. Bye. It was fun. - Come here tomorrow? - Yes. - Okay. - Great. - Okay. - Perfect. Ana? Yeah? - Can I talk to you over here for a moment? Sure, one sec. - You couldn't have waited one minute? - Glenn, we have to stay ahead of the pain or it's gonna get really bad, really fast. - He was fine, he was not in pain. He was having a good time with his friends. He was enjoying them. - I know, I understand. But your husband's a really stoic guy and he doesn't want you to know that he's in pain, but I can assure you he is. - And keeping him medicated makes your job that much easier? - No, no, no, no. - No, because then you would just have a nice quiet patient, right? Quiet. - No, it's not about- - Oh, just give him the damn shot. - Although reincarnation sounds pretty neat, not all of us want to come back for another life. - How do you not come back? - Have you heard of karma? Ah, your dahl. Simply put, karma is the universal law of action and reaction. Good actions gain good reactions and evil actions bear evil reactions. If one's karma is really good, one can get out of coming back. - So, what if you do something in this life, but you didn't mean to, it, it wasn't your fault? Not really. But you had to carry it? It's impossible for us to predict our future lives. But we believe that if a man's good deeds balance his bad deeds, his soul will be united with Krishna. - Is there any proof that reincarnation exists? - Proof is all around you. Just look at nature. In the summer, the tree flourishes. And in the winter, it loses its leaves and dies. There it is in the spring, alive and full of beauty. This is the true cycle of life. We humans think we apart from it, but the truth is we are not. - Oh, there's grandpa's truck, he'll drive me home. You're not gonna tell my mom about today are you? - Hey, Eli. I think that God looks at soldiers differently. I think he sees, they do things they don't want to. - I thought you don't believe in God. - I don't. But if I did, I think he'd be super smart and he'd see the whole picture and all the- - Extenuating circumstances? - Yeah. - What are you doing? - Just getting my stuff. - You know, maybe I'll come in for awhile. - Oh. Yeah, yeah, if you, if you want to. - Check out the team, - That sounds great. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Ah, my back. - God's sakes, Hal. Here, get up, easy. - Dad, dad, don't do that. You might make it worse. Tell them to go get an ambulance. - Oh, he doesn't need an ambulance. It's just a spasm. - He might, dad. Uncle Hal, has this ever happened to you before? - Yeah, 20 years ago. - 20 years ago, you gotta be kidding me, Hal. - What are you doing? What happened? - Nothing. He's fine. There were a couple of paramedics in the coffee shop. They'll be right down. - Thank you. - Listen, you're gonna be fine, Hal, okay? - Guess this sort of kills the Fiesta Cup for your, Dick. Too bad. - What'd you say? - Easy there, big fella. Just stating the obvious. - You know what's obvious, Tim? You are an asshole. That's what's obvious. - Calm down, Dick. - Don't tell me to calm down, asshole. Wanna watch the language, old man? - You want to see what an old man can do to you? You wanna see that? - Guess I'll see you tomorrow. - I guess you will. - Come on, let it go. Good luck. - I'll be better tomorrow, Dick. - You'll be okay, Hal. Just take it easy. - What are we gonna do? - I'm afraid that's it, kiddo. - What? - It's too late for me to find someone else, Eli, I'm sorry. - No, you can't just give up. - I'm not giving up, we just don't have a choice. - Yes we- - Eli, I know you're disappointed. - No, you're the one that always says we can't give up. - Eli. - No. - Eli, it's okay. - No, no, it's not. We, we can't give up. - Come here. You know I would do anything for you. But the tournament is tomorrow morning. - But. I promised my dad. What'd you promise your dad? - That we'd bring him the cup. - I could bowl for Hal. I'm a little, a lot rusty, but, I could. - Yes, yes, yes. That's a great idea. - Oh, no, no wait, wait. - Uncle Sean said it was his best sport. - Eli, we're bowling against some tough competition here. - Well, what? The important thing is to not give up, right? - When's the last time you bowled? - Does it matter? - Go get some shoes. - Ana. Uh, I don't need you anymore, Ana. - Well, I can stay till the boys get back. - No, not just tonight, I don't need you anymore at all. - I'm sorry, Glenn I- - I'll be calling hospice tomorrow to find a replacement. - Hey, I'm sorry if I- - Thank you for everything. - Glenn- - Please. - Okay. Okay. - It's too much shoulder, remember. You wanna shake hands, you wanna- - Dad. I got it. All right. - I think you're doing great, uncle Sean. - Come on. Oh, and remember, remember we have to be here at 10:00 AM. Shit. - Ana? Mom? - What? - Hal hurt his back, so uncle Sean is now on the team. Oh. Well that's, was Hal okay? - He's fine. Just pulled his back out. - Did you eat? - Yeah, we had burgers at the alley, where's Ana? - She, went home and Evie, went to the store and she'll meet you at home. - I'd like to sit with him. If that's okay with you. - Okay. - Okay, we gotta go. - I love you. - We're probably not gonna win the cup this year, although it's certainly not for lack of Eli's trying. That kid is something. I wish you could see it. Hal's son-in-law is replacing you and Sean is replacing Hal. It's like watching two giraffes try to bowl. And the sad thing is, is that Hal's son-in-law makes Sean look good. I was 22 when I had you. Not often you see such consistency, especially when the stakes are this high. And there's another strike for Earl Anthony. Here's a profile of Anthony from the back. Notice how he lifts the ball straight through his high hand going over the top of the ball very smoothly. You know, Beau, Earl Anthony will probably go down in history as one of the greatest bowlers that ever lived, if not,. Look at his form. Right there, another strike, doesn't get better than that. You know, Porter's just not- - Piece a cake. Sean? - Yeah? - Sean, am I dead? - No, you're here with me. - Glenn? - She's sleeping. - I went somewhere. - You're here now. - I missed you. - I missed you too. I'm, I'm sorry I wasn't here. - You're here now. That night, I know it was Pinky. Later coach. - Hey. - It's okay. - Mom? Oh, it's okay, sweetie, he's just tired. - You ready, Eli? Uh-huh. - When does Ana get here? - Uh, she should be here any minute. - You okay? - Yeah. - We're gonna have that cup for you when we come home. - I wouldn't count on it. - Good luck. - Listen, we're not gonna get past the first round but I really, really appreciate you stepping in for us like this. - So we have shirts? - Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. Here you go. Oh, hey. - Sorry we're late. - Put this on, go get some shoes. Here, Eli. Now this is your shirt, huh? Eli, listen. Uh, Ben, why don't you warm up? Listen, Eli. I don't want you to get your hopes up too high. I mean, there's three rounds to this tournament and we probably won't make it past the first round. So we're all gonna have to be okay with that, you know? I mean, winning is always great, but your dad will be proud of us with, or without that cup. But the important thing is, the fact thing is we did not quit. - Grandpa. - Did that just happen? - You're so beautiful. Every day I would go by that rec room on my way to football. And I'd hear this beautiful music. And I'd stop in the hallway and listen. One day I worked up the nerve, I opened the door and there you were. So many things. So many horrible things. And then I saw behind it. And then I would imagine myself back in the hall again, Outside that door listening to you. Glenn.

I see him in the way my grandfather looks at me and calls me kiddo, the way my uncle tells me about the things they did as boys. They way Evie's always there. And in the way my mother plays piano until I fall asleep at night. For the love they shared with him, goes through each of them and back and forth to me and is and always will be mine. ♪ Young journey ♪ ♪ Take me far away from here ♪ ♪ Young journey ♪ ♪ Just wanna disappear ♪ ♪ Take me under your wing ♪ ♪ Until I can fly again on my own ♪ ♪ Take me under your wing ♪ ♪ Until I can fly again way ♪ ♪ Fly again way back home ♪ ♪ Old voyage ♪ ♪ From one place to another ♪ ♪ Old voyage ♪ ♪ I could love you like no other ♪ ♪ Take me under your wing ♪ ♪ Until I can fly again on my own ♪ ♪ Take me under your wing ♪ ♪ Until I can fly again way ♪ ♪ Fly again way back home ♪ ♪ Fly again way back home ♪ ♪ Take me under your wing ♪ ♪ Until I can fly again on my own ♪ ♪ Take me under your wing ♪ ♪ Until I can fly again way ♪ ♪ Fly again way ♪ ♪ Fly again way back home ♪
