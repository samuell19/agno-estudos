Numbers, taxes, receipts... I make 'em look better than they did in real life. I'm an artistic genius. Then, how come you've got butter on your tie? Give it here! You know what? I give you this. You make good coffee. You're a slob, but you make good coffee. Ah, red roses. Very romantic, huh? Ah, the guy that sends these really knows what he's doing. The guy who sends those spends a lot of money... ...on something that ends up as garbage. I'm glad everybody ain't like you, Loretta. I'd be out of business. What are you talking? I love flowers. Thanks, Carmine. Are you ready? Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight? Very good, Mr. Johnny. We will both have the Ticino salad. And I'll have special fish. No, it's oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride. Maybe you're right. OK, we'll have the manicotti, Bobo. That'll give you a base for your stomach. You eat oily fish, you go up in the air... Halfway to Sicily, you'll be green and sweating. You look after me. You'll ruin the evening... Patricia, please, don't leave. Do you think I'm a talking doll?! I was just making a point about the way you stated your aspirations... You can kiss my aspirations, Professor! Kiss my aspirations? Very clever. The height of cleverness! Waiter. Yes? Would you do away with any evidence of her... ...and bring me a big glass of vodka? But absolutely. A man who can't control his woman... is funny. She was too young for him. What's up, Uncle Bobo? Tonight Mr. Johnny's gonna propose marriage. - How do you know? - He arranged it with me. When he asks, he's gonna wave... ...and then I serve the champagne. A good bachelor customer for 20 years.

What's the matter with you? My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes. - Have some dessert. - No, I shouldn't. - Will you marry me? - What? Will you marry me? Bobo, take the cart away. Very good, Miss Loretta. - Are you proposing marriage to me? - Yes. All right. You know I was married and that my husband died. What you don't know is I think he and I had bad luck. - What do you mean? - We got married at the City Hall. - It gave bad luck the whole marriage. - I don't understand. Right from the start, we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down? - On the floor? - Yeah, on the floor. - This is a good suit! - I know! I helped you pick it out. It had two pairs of pants! It's for luck. A man proposes marriage to a woman, he should kneel down. She's got him on his knees! He's ruining his suit. Is that man praying? - So... - Where's the ring? - The ring! - A ring, that's right. I would have sprung for the ring if it was me, capisce? - You could use your pinky ring. - I like this ring! You propose marriage to a woman, you should offer her a ring of engagement. Loretta... Loretta Castorini Clark... ...on my knees, in front of all of these people... ...will you marry me? Yes, Johnny. Yes, John Anthony Cammareri, I will marry you. I will be your wife. Salute, paesano! Bobo! - The check! - Right away, Mr. Johnny. What about the wedding? My mother is dying. When she's dead, I'll come back and we'll get married. How near death is she? A week. Two weeks... No more. How about we set a date? A month? Must it be so definite? Can't we just say we'll be married when I get back? Where? The City Hall? No. My mother is dying. I want a whole wedding, or we'll have bad luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, you gotta set a date. All right, all right. A month. - A month from today. - In a month. - A month from today. - Yes, from today. - OK, OK. - From today, right. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you gotta do is show up. Departure for Paris, please proceed to gate No.29. Come on, andiamo. - Call me when you get in. - I'll call from Mamma's. OK.

You ask for Ronny. - Invite him to the wedding. - Who is it? - It's my younger brother. - You've got a brother? We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to invite him to the wedding. - Will you do it? - Sure. Flight 604 for Rome with connections to Palermo is now boarding at gate 43. I gotta go. Have you got your ticket? OK.

I put a curse on that plane. My sister is on that plane. I put a curse on that plane that it's going to explode, burn and fall into the sea. 50 years ago, she stole a man from me. Si ha preso il mio uomo! Today she tells me that she never loved him... ...that she took him to be strong on me. Now she's going back to Sicily. Si torna in Sicilia. I cursed her that the green Atlantic water should swallow her up! I don't believe in curses. Neither do I. - Mr. Johnny's, right? - Yeah. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. The key's in it. What do you mean?! I've seen the way you look at her... ...and it isn't right! - How do I look at her? - Can I help you? - A split of Mumm. - So, how do I look at her? - Like a wolf! - Like a wolf, huh? - Uh-huh. Like a wolf. You've never seen a wolf in your life. That's $11.99. I've seen the wolf in everybody I ever met... ...and I see a wolf in you. Mm-hm. - That makes $20.

I put my hand in the slicer... ...and it got caught cos I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. And it's funny, cos when my fiancée found out about it... When she found out I had been maimed... ...she left me for another man. That's the bad blood between you and Johnny? Yes, that's it. Yeah, but that's not Johnny's fault. I don't care!

I don't need some man watching while I roll around in the mud. I think you like to roll around in the mud and I don't. That's fair... Sorry about that, folks. She's a very pretty mental patient. No, don't... No, no, no. Please, don't mind me. Just do me a favor and clear her place. Get rid of all evidence of her and bring me a big glass of vodka. Absolutely. I'm sorry if we disturbed you. I'm not disturbed by you. My lady friend has a personality disorder. She's just too young for you. - Ah, thanks, comrade. - It's nothing. Too young? I just got that. You know how to hurt a guy. - How old are you? - None of your business. I'm sorry. That was rude. Would you like to join me for dinner? Are you sure? I'd be delighted. I hate to eat alone. It's amazing how often I end up doing just that. Signora Castorini... your minestrone. - Thanks, Bobo. - Prego. What do you do? I'm a professor of communication at NYU. - That woman was a student of yours? - Sheila? Yeah, she was. Is. Was. There's an old saying my mother taught me. Don't shit where you eat. OK, I'll remember that. - What do you do? - I'm a housewife. - How come you're eating alone? - I'm not eating alone. - May I ask you a question? - Yeah, go ahead. Why do men chase women? Nerves. I think it's because they fear death. Well, maybe. Do you wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming. I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. At first, I was excited about something, I wanted to share it. Now it's rote. A multiplication table. Except sometimes... Sometimes, I'll be droning along... ...and I'll look up and I'll see a fresh... ...beautiful young face. And it's all new to her. I'm just this great guy who's brilliant and thinks out loud. When that happens, when I look out there among those chairs... ...and see a young woman's face... ...and see me in her eyes... ...me, the way I always wanted to be, maybe once was... ...I ask her out for a date. It doesn't last long. A few weeks... ...a couple of precious months. Then she catches on that I'm just this burned-out old gasbag... ...and she's as fresh and bright... ...and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face... ...or some action to that effect. What you don't know about women is a lot. Well... that's not what I hear. - Two white wines, please. - Yes, sir. I'd like two glasses of champagne. Canadian Club with ginger ale and Dubonnet on the rocks, please. - What's that? - This was done by Marc Chagall. As you can see, he was a great artist. - It's kinda gaudy. - He was having some fun. They get some turnout for this stuff, huh? It's the best thing there is. You know, I like parts of it, but I just don't... really get it. You haven't once said you like my dress. I like your dress. It's very bright. Oh... Will you hold this? Thanks. May I walk with you a ways? Sure. Thanks. - Do you live far from here? - Just up there. Piano. Tutti piani. Andiamo. Ah, che bella luna. Andiamo vedere la luna. Piano. Non tirare! Piano! Hey, piano, piano! Ssh! Andiamo, andiamo! - You knew that man? - Yes. ♪ Bada ♪ Sotto il guanciale ♪ C'è la cuffietta rosa ♪ Se vuoi... ♪ Se vuoi serbarla a ricordo... ♪ D'amor ♪ Addio ♪ Addio senza rancor ♪ Dunque è proprio finita? ♪ Te ne vai, te ne vai, la mia piccina? That was so awful. - Awful? - Beautiful! Sad. - She died. - Yes. I couldn't believe it. I didn't think she would die. - I knew she was sick, but... - She had TB. I know! She was coughing her brains out. And still she had to keep singing. Pop. Pop, what are you doing here? Wait for me by the doors, Mona. - Mona? - Excuse me! - What did you do to your hair? - I... had it done. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Who's that? You're engaged. - You're married. You're my daughter. Don't act like a puttana. - And you're my father... - All right. I didn't see you here. I don't know if I saw you here or what. Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a drink. That woman was not my mother, OK? That's my house. - You mean the whole house? - Yes. My God! It's a mansion. It's a house. I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do? He's a plumber. Well, that explains it, then. Temperature's dropping. - I guess you can't invite me in. - No. People home. No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married. Because I know who I am. - You're shivering. - I'm a little cold. You're a little boy. And you like to be bad. We could go to my apartment. See how the other half lives. I'm too old for you. I'm too old for me. That's my predicament. Goodnight. Goodnight. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too? Sure. I'm freezing. Goodnight. Anything else, folks? - Loretta? - No. - I think that's it, Al. - See you, Al! - What do you wanna do now? - I wanna go home. - Goodnight, Al. - Take it easy, Ronny. God, it's cold. It smells like snow. You know, my mother guessed my father was seeing somebody. That Mona, I mean, she's some piece of cheap goods. Who am I to talk? - What's the matter? - How can you ask me that? - You're making me feel guilty. - You are guilty! I'm guilty. Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta. - Yeah, well, I know what I know. - And what do you know? OK, you tell me my life. I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf. You run to the wolf in me. That don't make you no lamb. You're gonna marry my brother. Why do you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe's the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. I mean, you waited for the right man the first time. - Why didn't you wait for him again? - Because he didn't come. - I'm here. - You're late. This is your place. So this is where we were going. Yeah. You know, we had a deal. You said if I came with you to the opera... ...you'd leave me alone for ever. And I came with you! I'm gonna marry your brother and you're gonna leave me alone for ever, right? A person can see where they've messed up in their life. They can change the way they do things. They can even change their luck. So maybe my nature does draw me to you. But I don't have to go with it. I can take hold of myself and I can say yes to some things... ...and no to other things that will ruin everything. Otherwise, you know, what... What good is this stupid life that God gave us? I mean, for what? Are you listening to me?! Yeah. Everything seems like nothing to me now. I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The past and the future is... ...a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here... ...is you... and me. - I wanna go home. - No. - I'm gonna go home. - No! - I'm freezing to death. - Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta... ...I love you. Not... not like they told you love is. I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice. It ruins everything. It breaks your heart. It makes things a mess. We aren't here to make things perfect. - The snowflakes are perfect... - Oh! The stars are perfect. Not us. Not us! We are here to ruin ourselves... ...and... and to break our hearts... ...and love the wrong people. And die! I mean that the storybooks are bullshit! Now I want you to come upstairs with me... ...and get in my bed! Come on. Come on. 19 Cranberry Street, Brooklyn. Got it. Hold it! - How much? - 25. - 25 dollars? - Yeah. Hold it. Hey! Oh, hi. I'm sorry to call so late. Moving in? No, I came right from the airport. Come on in. Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her. She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come through. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you! Thank you. Where is she? Out. I don't know where. So. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo. This is what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle. A miracle? Well, that's news. My mother's recovered. - You're kidding? - Oh, no. The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then... ...she completely pulled back from death... ...and stood up... and put on her clothes... ...and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners, and me, and herself. She ate a meal that could choke a pig. - That's incredible. - Yes. Hi, Pop. Oh, my God. Is he all right? My father-in-law's got this wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny. There's a question I want to ask. I want you to tell me the truth... if you can. Why do men chase women? Well uh... There's the Bible story. God. God took a rib from Adam... and made Eve. Now, maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib... ...he left a big hole there. A place where there used to be something. And the women have that. Now maybe... ...just maybe a man isn't complete as a man... ...without a woman. Why would a man need more than one woman? I don't know. Maybe because he fears death. That's it. That's the reason. - I don't know! - No! That's it. No. Thank you. Thank you for answering my question. Hi. Hello, Mr. Castorini. Oh. Hi. Where you been? I don't know where I've been and I don't know where I'm going. All right? You'll have your eyes opened for you, my friend. - I have my eyes open. - Oh, yeah? Well, stick around. Don't go on any long trips. - I don't know what you mean. - That's the point. I'll say no more. You haven't said anything. And that's all I'm saying. - Cosmo. - What? I just want you to know, no matter what you do... ...you're gonna die, just like everybody else. Thank you, Rose. You're welcome. I'm going to bed now. I'm going. Good. He doesn't like you. But thank you for answering my question. - You don't know where Loretta is? - No. No idea. Mrs. Castorini, will you tell Loretta that I'll come by in the morning? - We... We need to talk. - OK, I'll tell her. OK. Thank you. Watch it! The house! ♪ O dolce viso ♪ Di mite circonfuso alba lunar ♪ In te, ravviso ♪ II sogno ch'io vorrei sempre sognar ♪ Fremon già nell'anima ♪ Le dolcezze estreme ♪ Ah! Tu sol commandi amor ♪ Fremon nell'anima ♪ Dolcezze estreme ♪ Fremon dolcezze estreme ♪ Nel bacio freme amor What the hell happened to you? I really don't know where to start. - Your hair's different. - Ma, everything is different. - Are you drunk? - No. Are you drunk? No. But I have a hangover. - Where's Pop? - Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night. What?! He's in Sicily. - No more, he's not. - He's there with his dying mother. - She recovered. - She was dying! It was a miracle. This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles. I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a lovebite on your neck. He's coming back this morning. Your life's going down the toilet. Cover up that damn thing! Put some make-up on it! All right! Ma, OK, fine! But you gotta help me. Hurry up... You get it. Answer the door! Mother? Hi. Is Loretta home? Come on in. It's not Johnny. Ronny! Is Johnny here? - No, but he's coming. - Good. We can get this out on the table. Hi. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. I'm Rose Castorini. - It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you. You got a lovebite on your neck. - Your mother's recovered from death. - Oh, good. - We're not close. I'm not... - Ouch! - You gotta leave. - I want to meet the family. No. Really, you gotta get out of here. - Anyone want some oatmeal? - No, Ma. Yes, Mrs. Castorini. I would love some. No, we don't want any oatmeal. Ma! That was a... This is a... Oh! - Thanks, Ma. - You're welcome. - Hi. - Hi. Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother. It's very good to meet you, Mr. Castorini. I have a feeling this is going to be just delicious. - You're Johnny's brother? - Yeah. Don't look at me like that, OK? Hi, Pop. Buongiorno. - What's the matter, Pop? - I'm old. The old are not wanted. And if they say it, they have no weight. But, my son... I must speak. You must pay for the wedding of your only daughter. You break your house through pride. There. - I... I've said it. - It's OK, Pop. If she gets married... I'll pay for the whole thing. Bravo. Bravo. Adesso, parla giusto. Bravo. Now you're talking. Bravo. Parlato bene. Ha fatto bene. Bravo. Let's eat. Have I been a good wife? Yeah. I want you to stop seeing her. OK. And go to confession. A man understands one day that his life is built on nothing... ...and that's a bad, crazy day. Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo. Anch'io ti amo. - It's Johnny, I'll get it. - I'll get it. - I should tell him. - I will. What am I gonna tell him? Tell him the truth, Loretta. They find out anyway. You're right, Papa. Ti amo, mio piccolo angelo. - Hi, Loretta. - Hi. - Hi, Loretta. - Hi. Why aren't you two at the store? Do you have something you wanna tell us, honey? No. We just come from the bank. Yeah. Oh, my God! I forgot to make the deposit! Oh, she's got it. - I knew she had it! - We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday. And then we went to the bank this morning, and no bag. We never suspected you. Listen, would anyone like some coffee? That's a good idea. - What's with this suspected? - I'll tell you later. I forgot to make the deposit. Sit down. Have some coffee. - So what are we doing? - Waiting. For Johnny Cammareri. My name's Ronny. Johnny's brother. Oh. Nice to meet you. I'm Rita Cappomaggi. - Raymond Cappomaggi. Rose's brother. - Hi. Someone tell a joke. I'll get it. I thought Johnny was in Palermo. It's Johnny Cammareri! Loretta? Ronny! - Have you come to make peace with me? - Yes. But... ...you may not want to. Ronny, of course I want to. Johnny, your mother was dying. How did she recover? I told her we were to be married and she got well right away! - I'm sure she did! - It was a miracle. Johnny, I have something I have to tell you. And I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone. No, I need my family around me now. Loretta... ...I can't marry you. What?! - If I marry you, my mother will die! - What do you mean? We're engaged! Loretta, what are you talking about? I'm talking about a promise! He proposed! My mother was dying and now she's not! You're 42 years old. She's still running your life. And you don't love your mother! You are a big liar. Because I have a ring right here. Oh, I must ask for that back. - All right. The engagement is off! - You will see this is the best thing. And you'll drop dead and I'll mourn you in a red dress! - Loretta... - What? - Will you marry me? - What?! Where's the ring? Johnny. Can I borrow that ring? Thanks. Loretta Castorini... ...will you marry me? Yes, Ronny. In front of all these people, I'll marry you. - Do you love him, Loretta? - Ma, I love him awful. Oh, God. That's too bad. She loves me. What's the matter, Pop? I'm confused. To Loretta and Ronny! There we are! Thank you, thank you. Come on, Raymond! Bevi. Come, come. Your brother is here and... No, I don't want any. You are a part of the family. Don't you realize? Come on, bevi! Everybody, come on! Glass in hand! Alla famiglia! To... to family! To family! Alla famiglia! Salute!
