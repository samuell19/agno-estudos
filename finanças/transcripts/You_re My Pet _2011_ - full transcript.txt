You're better educated and your salary is higher than mine. You're taller and more capable. It's a burden. To be dumped by that kind of scoundrel. That's right. How many can endure men that are better than they are. I heard, she's transferred to that strange fashion department. Did you hear any of the managing director's words at all? Work within the budget! -=You're my Pet=- What is the use of doing your best? In the end, he'll just betray you. How long has it been since the break up? His credit card fee are killing me. Every time, I'd get angry. That's why pets are the best. Our family's BB isn't like that. He's considered as my life's energy. Look here! Not too bad. Let us all see, senior! Mom. =I've decided to divorce your father.= You aren't even determined, what's the use of saying it everyday? I've got a call. Talk to you later? Dad. =Even at my age. Your mom wants a divorce.= Although I don't know what's it about? You'll only be the one suffering a loss. Put your tail down. =It's been cut off long ago. I have no tail.= This is Ji Eun Yi. =Are you avoiding my calls?= I'm busy. Later. =It's my birthday. You have to come.= Mr. Seo Jeong Min. This section: sex appeal Your idea isn't bad. Get rid of it. Use only ITS. Chief Editor has already been mentioned this. Right... I'll amend it. It isn't the same with people being educated in the States. This doesn't concern being educated abroad. Pay attention. It's a constant mistake. So what! If you've studied abroad? You look down on me because I didn't? How long have I lived in Itaewon? It's like stepping in dog poop. Why is she in our team, anyway? You need to shape up. Her weapon's her education. She'll uses it to look down on others. She'll only find herself perfect. You hold your temper well. Seems, you get along well with her. Women who have strong points are good. Doesn't it give me a dazzling kind of feeling? That dazzling feeling, is because it is over flowing. We were already worked to death by that bastard Chief Editor. Why is that women like that too? Really annoying... Hey, Seo Jeong Min! What are you always in the women's bathroom? The men's bathroom isn't clean!? The Aunt that cleans the toilet isn't on duty? Aunty!? Superior, Ji Eun Yi? Haven't seen you for awhile. It's been awhile. How are you? Heard you moved to the Fashion Department? Must be very fun. You've met with lots of designers, right? I'm envious! Really? Apply for a position, then? I was just being polite... Got to go now. Got a business trip tomorrow. If not for the transfer. You should've been the one to go. Taxi! let's have lunch, when my time allows. Handsome. So handsome. Heard he doesn't work with women. Why? I don't know. Doesn't like women? Gay? Can't be. He grew up surrounded by women. When he was in England, he was paired together with a woman. During practice, the woman fell and sustained injuries. That woman, in the end gave up ballet. He still blames himself. Idiot. We rarely come to these places. Fun, isn't it? Brings back memories, when we're in university. Which 30 years old has a birthday party here? Rotten girl. I left my child at home. This really isn't fun at all. My mom gonna kick me outta the house soon. Even if it's true. You can't just find anyone and marry. I really want a sense of security. I've already given my best. Shouldn't I be a satisfied? My heart is vexed and my head hurts. There is this saying, men are like empty taxis. If you wait too long for a particular one. You'll just have to find another. But once you give up. They'll all appear. But once you comprehend, on which should you ride... Timing becomes a problem. Another gets in. And it'll become someone else's. I, have confidence to continue going. You're at it again. That's why men like Kim Jeong Suk ran away. Let him leave. I loathe inferior man now. Now, I will only have interest in... Someone that's taller, smarter and earns more. What about taking care of a pet? My boss just got a pet. Recently that old man has become a lot nicer. You can't even take care of a boyfriend. Let alone a pet. Puppy. Sit. Bark. Lie down. Hey! It doesn't eliminate stress. It makes someone more frustrated. =Therefore...= I starved it to death. =Therefore...= I want a real puppy. But, they look so weak. what if there's an accident, after I bring it home? Momo, very sturdy, very strong. I heard you failed to be chosen again. Too disappointing. Do you only have this little bit of ability? Out of my house. Now! I hate sleeping in the studio. Hot water, warm bed, clean bathroom. Aren't these basic necessities? Aren't there anyone willing to take care of me? Are you a puppy on the side of the road? Don't even think about relying on me. How much would a five-start hotel be each month? If you have that kind of money. You'll be staying long term in an inn. Brother!? I know of an awesome place. The taste is a bit salty. And also when you clean match the height. When urinating, raise the toilet seat. Yes, sister. Did you do something wrong? Nothing's wrong? How could that be possible ? Don't stand like that, when you're brushing your teeth, Shouldn't you mention that you're bringing a friend back? What to do? Where exactly are my things? This is not your home, What right have you, to bring someone home to sleep? Just this once. I know him well. he's alright. Men will only side with men. I haven't seen anyone that haven't. I'll give up my salary for today. Just a day. A day. You really... Alright! I'll fix mom and dad's situation. Make sure they don't divorce! Count on me. Hey... Are you sure? Clean and cook? I'm not versed in household chores. If she isn't satisfied, my sister will take care of it. Pretend to do it and it'll be fine. But then again, can I go through with this? She is my sister. And you're a man. Very clean. Very warm. But this place, How come it even smells good? This house is best, right? Of course. I know you're talented. But that's not the problem. I know you approve of my talent. You just wanted me to get a partner in the musical. Is this really the reason? Would this be the whole reason? This is a good proposal. But the condition is that you have to sing a duet with a woman. Let's go in and eat. Let's go. For a while now she's been an eyesore. What are you doing, aren't you having fun? Why? Why? What? I'll be back. Please enjoy the meal. Hey, In Ho, Gang In Ho. You better stop right there, you bastard. Stop, Rotten brat. You always work this late? Know how long I've waited? You're the first woman I've seen with a hand this smooth. Why are you here? Eun Su went home. Although it will be awkward at first, I'll do my best on behalf of Eun Su. I have already gave him 6 month's rent. Ji Eun Su. =The number you have dialed is unavailable at the moment...= Looks like you like puppies. Want to take care of 1? But dogs bark andl shed hair. Which is also not great for your windpipe. Their excrement's are also not your common filth. Furthermore, training them to understand takes a lot of time. I'm different. I said I'm different. What? Puppy? Instead of a puppy, you can see me as a human pet. If it's an animal, then it can live here together with me. I'll feed you when you need to eat, as long as you come when I call you, you'll also occasionally need to perform. From head to toe, a pet with no human rights. Be one that listens to me and doesn't annoy me. I'll take care of you then. How is it? With this... are you not confident? I'll have him leaving in no time. Are you willing? Oh God... what's he doing? Owner. I'm relying on you. Wang. Wang? What are you doing? Get out! No out... No out. No out. Get out! No out. You're disturbing my sleep! Yes, there isn't any changes, Proceed as planned. The layout proposal you sent, has been sent to your side right? Mr. Seo Jeong Min, please come over. Hold it like this will be fine. Here. You need to look here. Welcome back! I signed for your delivery. Want a reward? That's correct. Help wash my hair. Dandruff on the floor, will annoy you every time you step on it. Also, I'm a pet. Shouldn't the owner be in charge of washing the pet's hair? You still have the other hand. Look? Paper cut. If it touches water, I'm in trouble. But, how come you're not using honorifics? (Honorifics - suffixes for addressing people respectfully) Pets don't use honorifics, master. Started ballet when I was only 4. Won lots of prizes and many had great expectations for me. And that got me thinking about my long-term prospects. Musicals are exciting and there's also singing. Though my family opposed, I couldn't make up my mind. But this is really refreshing. Try saying "Is there any itchy spots left?" at least once. Don't taunt me. By the way, What's with those sunglasses? What's there to be embarrassed about in front of your pet? Should I take it all off so you can see better? Is there even anything to see? I'll show you exactly how good I'm built. Stop acting up and sit down. I asked, in front of the master, what's there to be embarrassed about? I'm a pet. Fried rice! This is really delicious. This is really yummy. It's great that I found an owner who can cook. This isn't a human act of taking in a pitiful child. Do you know what it means to be a pet and an master? Master, did you know that you've mentioned it 15 times already? I'm confident that I can do well. What did you say your name was? Name? You can just call me whatever you like. Perhaps names of your favorite actor or singer. By, this sausage will taste better if it's sliced. Actor or singer... All right, From today, your name shall be. Momo. Momo? Sounds too much like a dog! It's the name of the dog I once had. You. Seem similar to Momo in many ways. Momo... Wait a second... Isn't there a Momo from a children's book? She's female! I'm a male! Pick another. I think it's very fitting. I don't like it. Pick another one. Nope, it's perfect. Let's take a look at your face. Very nice, you're very pretty. Let's see. It'll get better. Mom, is going to be really upset. Don't talk nonsense. Your mom's totally absorbed in her dramas. She isn't even interested if I'm there or not. But this fellow will come out, with his tail wagging. Just to greet me. You wouldn't understand. Right baby, let's go... Looks great? Pet. Master. What? When you're home, you should pay attention to your pet. Compared to what I thought, your chest is... Who am I? Master Ji Eun Yi. And you? Pet. Correct. A pet is just a pet. An animal. From now on. I make the rules and you follow. 1. A pet is neither a lover nor a husband, it's only a pet. 2. While the master is working the pet has to be quiet. 3. The pet is not to touch the food of the master's, especially the ice cream. Let's take a break. Your new landlord. Nope. Your new master. What kinda of person is she? A capable, hard working career woman. So surely she's very brave. Seems like she has issues. Letting others see this side of her, She has that tiring kind of personality where her self-respect would never allow her to admit it. It is already the 3rd month. Aren't you privy to our style or have you not been trying hard enough? What exactly do you want? Is the task too difficult, that you wouldn't want to waste your energy? Why do women spend money to buy our magazine? I thought... Stop thinking and write it again. Yes. Hey. But what would a strong willed person like her need someone like you? Don't know... maybe she fell for my devilishness. Do you want to fall in? Hey... Hey... Hey... Hey... Hey... What's this? Right! What next on the list? Interviews is Ji seonbae's specialty. He's at the top of his game. He's experience is second to none. It's a great opportunity to learn some things. I never said I didn't want to do it. Good. try it and see. What's for lunch? Always opening your big mouth. Get up, get up now. What? What's wrong? Momo. I'll wash your hair. Can't I sleep a little more? Come here immediately. Why did I do wrong? Why would you provoke a good person? So cold, change the temperature a little. Quiet down! Momo. Have you any idea the amount of hard work it takes to make one issue of this magazine? Next time, use a book stand. Switch on the lamp! Sit up straight! Seeing the owner's severe face is very tiring. I am human though. Congratulations! Congratulations! Heard you got yourself a Doberman?! Lend him to me too from time to time! Who said it's a Doberman.. It's a human boy. A human boy who can dance. Sounds like he's enjoying himself. Senior...! There a extremely handsome man looking for you. So you 're moving into this building? Well, the move's almost done. Happy to hear that! That's great! Have you been well? Eun Yi? Senior Cha? Seems he's done well in the company. Wasn't he your first unrequited love? Maybe he came because he was thinking about you. Cha seonbae... That's a bit far fetched. You can't possibly fall in love with someone at your age. Use your previous heart to think of him. Hey, you, don't say that. I can do anything on my own. I'm a woman too, you know. You can't get married before me! Ji Eun-i Fighting! Fighting! - Do well! - You do well for yourself, then! I am usually doing great. Senior...! We're going for drink. Let's go together! Sorry. Just wanna go home early. I haven't prepared dinner for Momo yet. I'll join the next time. Right! Seo Jung-min Regarding the design this time... There won't be any amendments. It's alright the way it is. Bye. Please walk slowly. It hurts, it hurts! It really hurts! It really hurts! This really hurts! This really hurts! So it really hurts like this, huh? Do you have to be like this? This is animal abuse! Like this? Does it hurt this way? Senior? Oh no. I was just up reading. This Saturday? Yes, yes. The weather today is really nice! Senior. This necktie looks really great on you, it fits you well.. This is really not like me, maybe because it's my first love? You came early. The weather's nice today. Senior. Your necktie looks really great! That's great. That's great. That's great. That's great. Careful on your way back. Go on in. So you won't ask me to come in for a cup of tea? Momo. Quiet! You have a dog? Seems like a big one. A friend of mine asked me to take care of him for one day. These guys seem like they're very excited. I'll call you tomorrow. I'll call you tomorrow. And also... I'll call you tomorrow. If you're home, you should at least make some noise. After naps you just go with other guys to do strange stuff. Strange. What time is it, and you're still sleeping. What? What's that look in your eyes? You said you'd be home late 'cause you had work. But now that you've got a boyfriend you start lying, right? Why are you unbuttoning your clothes? Any idea under a full moon, what a wolf becomes? You're... a wolf? A dog is the same thing as a wolf. If an owner doesn't care anymore, the pet will become restless, and stop behaving. It's just animal instinct. That kind of thing... What is this! My BB just casually peed in my favorite shoes. But, if you get angry, it'll be counterproductive. It's best to humor him. They're very simple. After a while they'll just follow you around. Oh... I see. Thank you, Mi Sung. I need to make him happy as soon as possible. I'm so hungry it's making me weak. Sausage want to flat form Quick... You... You! Don't stand so close to me. But, owner is a little chubbier than I thought. Momo? You're too cute nowadays. Hand. Really, you're more and more... My stomach...! Check the samples and then give them to me. Really? Okay, I'll see you later. I'm being followed. I think they're carrying weapons. Pretend we're a couple and walk one block with me. Owner, did you miss me? One...Two...Three! Today is a beautiful day. Okay, I'll forgive you today. But do you know where I'm going? You still need to follow me. Hotel! That's nonsense. Where are we going? Outstanding team. Yes. I'm really sorry. Please put in a good word for me. Wait, wait! What perfect timing. What is all this? Have a look. So cold. Brand name cold medicine. Bye bye. Senior? What's your relationship with him? Who? Him. Oh, he's my cousin. Is he Kang In Ho? Young Eun, Are you familiar with him? He won a lot of prizes at the International University of the United Kingdom. He's really famous. I completely became a ballet fan. But I don't understand. Apparently he is Ji seonbae's cousin. Heard that 2 years ago, He quit ballet. Why? Slippers. Sit down. I'm sorry, auntie, can you move a little? I'll be a little bit late today. That, I'm the same age as her. Really... You look like you're 41. Damn guy! Hey, where did he come up with the number? Auntie? Who's that handsome brother? His butt is so round. Is that right? This is crazy... Hey, this is crazy. Somehow it turned into this kind of situation. But after a while, it won't be anything at all. More and more intense. It's nothing like the last Momo. Right, Yeong Eun? What have you been looking at? Thinking that dead puppy and this young man are similar? You've finally relaxed a little. This girl to one hundred years joking give this once open. Whether or not he's a pet, the fact that he's a man still remains. Living together. Man and woman. Man and woman! It's not what you think. In my opinion. The brain is filled to the brim with feelings. I don't care. As long as you like it. You can count on me. If you need to go on a business trip . How about Cha Wu Seong? I don't know... Being with senior is bliss. But I'm always nervous, Just trying to look beautiful in front of him. I've seems to be losing myself. It's really alright. You can put me down. Aren't you limping every step? You don't have to pretend to be strong in front of me. I've become one of those women I've always laughed at. It's tiring putting up a front. Being with Momo isn't be like that. Momo? How did you let yourself get caught in this type situation? Hey! Don't let this chance slip away. If you like him, then do something about it. Do you think any other girl would let such a good man slip away? If you don't do something immediately, He'll get gobbled up fast, you idiot. Think it's funny? Remain calm and listen. Mezai called in sick. And Seo Jeong Min got into a traffic accident. Deadlines in 3 days. I can't dump this mess into someone else's lap. So, question is. Can you handle it alone? Very good. Momo, I'm working late today too. I'll buy extra dog food when i return. I'm not a guard dog to be left home alone. I'm a lap dog that like affection. Think just by leaving a message, Momo will understand? Really? I'm also a a young guy. Think about it. When the owner isn't home, what does a pet do? Well... Shouldn't the pet wait miserably. Til the owner's home? I just don't know how much love a pet can get. I shouldn't let it bother me. Isn't it strange? It ain't. Every man has self respect. Self respect. It's not that. She says that if I'm a pet, I can stay. But. If the owner loses love. I'll get abandoned, I'll be a sad pet. Then I think that 'this' would be very difficult. This, what is this? That... That. Too tiring. I used to be a morning person, but now every night she lets me accompany her. If I'm too tired, that's okay, but then she says I'n not taking it seriously. Then again, if I'm sleepy, I should show her. Is it really that fun, wrestling machine? Hey... I know... I know... It's not that. Listen, Wait a second... Looks just like my late mother. Really good. Should get some for Momo. Oh no... This is expensive. I should teach my pet well. If you treat him too well, it'll be tough later. Momo, I'm back. Where are you? Owner is back. Not only does he not wag his tail to meet me, he's still asleep. What is it? Swallow it quickly! Sleep again after dinner! Didn't I specifically asked you to call for confirmation? When? I didn't hear anything. Now is not the time to argue about who's in charge of it. Deadline's tomorrow! I will meet up with them personally and apologize. You're got til tomorrow. Go to the printers and check. Oh... Are you asking for my help? It's your fault, why are you angry at me? Lee Young Eun, What do you think you're doing? What? Does it look like I'm playing around? It's all difficult. I'll give you difficult. Even if it's difficult. It's your job, Lee Young Eun. If you're unhappy with me, just tell me. You're being childish, And I can't stand it anymore. What? What did you say? What? Didn't you hear me? Want me to say again? I told you straighten up. Stop making gestures behind my back. When I'm working, I didn't here, I don't know... You're the same as a loach. Are you alright? You don't look too good. What is the use of pretending to be weak? You thought this man, will work on behalf of you? Is it because I changed the lipstick colour? Wu Seong. I need to go to the printers. And I'm too afraid of taking the taxi around this time. Would you mind giving me a ride? This is heavy. Sure... okay. Great! Still together? =Yeong Eun said there is something on her mind so,= =I'm talking with her now.= =There wasn't an chance just now.= =You know there's a company party, right?= =It's scheduled for 2 days, 1 night. Wanna go?= I'll think about it while I'm finishing up my work. Leave me alone... I just came home this morning. Senior? Apologies. I like Yeong Eun more. Approaching me when she's tired, and will also act like a spoilt child. I am no longer, momo. Edward. This name sounds better. Although I'm sorry to Eun Yi, but recently you've really neglected me. My new master's younger. Her chest is also bigger. Let's go Edward. Momo. No. Momo! Hello, Eun Yi. No. How could you? What are you doing in my room? I didn't do anything. Really? Just felt your chest. Are you crazy... Gently! What kinda master are you? Here. Let's play this. Quickly... I like that person. I really like him. Will it be too much to dress extravagantly? White. Just like a fashion show. Going on a newly wed trip? What newly wed trip? There's a 2 day, 1 night business trip. What? That is really bad. You need to go on a business trip during your break? You're still staying at that kind of company. What's wrong with your foot? Hurt it during practice. Are you not going to the hospital? This is nothing. Go check it at the hospital tomorrow. Can't master go with me? I'm already very tired. Tomorrow is the business trip. Yeong Eun. Let's talk. I'll see you later. Is that an urgent call? I want to tell a friend to feed Momo. But no one's picking up the call. It'll be fine skipping 1 meal. Anyway, you're returning tomorrow. When I'm drunk I still won't forget. When I held you that time, it wasn't a sudden impulse. Although it has been four years, but being able to see you again really is lucky. To you, am I inadequate? I want to be together with you no matter when it is. Please raise your wedding ring a little higher. Because you went crazy over a man, a dog pitifully died alone. Is that true? I am sorry. I'm too worried about Momo, He hasn't eaten. Momo? Momo? Momo? What? You're back from your business trip? Feeding a dog is that important? In a situation like that, dog food... You really aren't even as good as a dog. Ji Eun Yi, why are you this complicated? I received a proposal. I should be happy. Momo. I want to to bathe. First remove your makeup. Wash after sleeping. If I want to wash, let me wash. I want to cool down for a moment. I want to bathe. Come here, Momo. Let's sleep together. What did other people say? You really are my friend. Recently isn't it this? I did think of these. Should I get married? He really is someone I like. Living alone, if you become old, it will be very lonely. Not getting married it fine. I will say by your side for a lifetime. Might as well just live together with a pet. Want it to be like that? What are you? What are you doing making me confused? In the end, the one hurting is me. 2. This... It is all right. I'm fine. I need to sleep! That day... I'm really sorry... Forget it. The magazine's out. Looks good. Let's take Momo on a walk some day. Right. That dog is one month old right? Can I come play at your house? I would really want to see Momo. She is very shy. I don't know if she will bite. It's all right. I won't die. Quiet! You're like an idiot, how did you think of this. Yes. I am an idiot. I know when he is here he would want to see, what do you want me to say. Senior expects to see Momo. Look. That is to say, She is my substitue. Since it is already like this, just find a better one. Quickly, go out! Quickly. You really have no kindness. Don't be so long-winded. Go quickly! I know, okay, I know. Is there a guest? He is my younger cousin. How do you do? I am Kang In Ho. Nuna told me about you. Yes. Recently, I've been helping him with his English. See you again. Go on. Ah, this fellow! A bit smaller than I thought. He looks so playful. Hungry? I'm so hungry. Great. Thank you. I can wear it myself. So cute. Eun Yi. Senior? Nuna, I forgot about this, Can you translate it for me for a moment? Are you all right? Are you all right? Want to play a game with me? Well... Okay! Then I will start first. Okay, do it like I'm doing it. Go with it like this. When it comes like this, a smash. You're doing good. Better than I thought. One more time. I'm leaving. You bad girl! Are you hiding a gathering of handsome men! Brother. I really love you. Want me to cook for you? But... Will you bring me along after you marry? Think about it? How can I bring you? Say something that makes sense. Really? Throwing away the unimportant. You're really comfortable with that? What? Why are you giving me the 3rd degree? How about not doing it? The thing about me going abroad. What? What are you saying? That great dancer wants to see you. A chance like that won't come again. Just for that woman, If it is someone that will come chase me, then i can run away with ease, matters that people become accustomed to, That one will really be poisonous. Do I need to leave that house? Senior? I'm leaving early cause my work is done. Want to have dinner together? That... I am sorry. I'm still in the office. I'm not done yet. I'll be late. Stop...! When you kick! Can't you do it properly? And you... You're always one beat slow! I am sorry. Again. Fine...! Are you really going to be like this!? Don't you want to perform? Momo. Why is he not here? He's not picking up. Don't tell me he was hit by a car? Or did Momo roll down the mountain? I'm sorry for someone who has personal relationships. Think about it. He is an adult. Worry only when he's not back within two or three days. It's possible he might be disgusted and ran away. Will he eat on time? He also doesn't have any money. If you're so worried, go to possible places to search! Where are you going? Do you have confidence to continue this kind of relationship? What are you doing here? The rehearsal ran into problems. It's easier trying to solve it here. What are you doing here? Inform me about your whereabouts! Why aren't you answering your phone? I switched it off during practice. Since I didn't go home, I leave a note. What's wrong? You worried about me? Worry... But... Can I say that kind of thing? Whatever it is, just say it, momo. Your stomach seems to be sticking out. What? What did you eat? You want to be hit? Come here! Come here! I... can I sleep on the side today? Momo. You really are arrogant. It's for you. The editor said I had to give it to you. Momo is a person. 3 years? At least 3 years is needed. As for you... I'm sure you're be able to find work there. I wouldn't mind if you didn't work. I always wanted to tell you that. I know you're nervous in front of me. It's alright. I'm confident. You will eventually be comfortable to share everything with me. All men say that. So it's important. Not to show everything you have to your man. The men always expects the women to show all their cards. But... They're all run away. Once they learn too much. If it's according to what you said, being reserved isn't all bad. For me, If both my daughter and husband listen to me. I'll run away. Is join friendship or blind dating anything don't care all must to see. It depends on who the person is. This... Would senior likes this? Will he? I don't think so. Weren't you helping? Fine. It's my fault asking for your advise. Short is not suitable. See it to the end. Wu Seong, Yeong Eun, why are you here? Do you have time? I have something important to say. I'm a little busy now. Can it wait til tomorrow? 5 minutes. Senior? Eun Yi? Momo. Why are you picking up the call? Don't you look at the number you're dialling? You! Haven't you met up? I'm aimless... The performance have already started. If I leave, I'll feel bad. It's like in the movies. Because they left, Everything becomes a mess. If I leave, He'll say the woman has no patience nor tolerance. That's... What men had said about me. But the number. That person's number. I absolutely can't think of it. He is someone I like. How can I not remember his phone number? I want to confess properly. Let's go home. I don't want to go home. and cry horribly. Fine. Today I'll become Eun Yi's transformer. Like this, like that. I'll be whatever you want me to be. Are you versed in this kind of situation? Have you fallen for me? Feels good. I've read somewhere, relationships between men and women is like a dance that each other dances to.
