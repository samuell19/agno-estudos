Only 13 months. It does seem longer than that though. All my friends... killed. It's your worst nightmare come true. You read about this kind of thing in the paper or see it in the movies, but you don't actually ever think it'll happen to you. Seemingly out of nowhere, it does. I can't believe it. He killed them all. And even though I know he was caught and put away for his sickening deeds, I just know that's not the last I'm going to see of him. They should have given him the electric chair. He could get out of that institution, if he already didn't. Everywhere I go, my mind sees him. I just can't let it go. The travesty of it all. I remember the incident in nightmares, every time I sleep. Oh, I can't live like this much more. I know he's coming to get me. I can feel it. I'm the last survivor of that day. I know he wants me dead too, but why? His dark image is forever embedded in my consciousness. Wherever I am, he's there. I'm the last one, the only survivor, except for Detective Rosenberg, who managed to captured him. I'll try to forget the day one more night. And if I still feel this way, I'll go for help. I guess I should just give it a little more time. I guess he can't get out of the institution anyway, and they still may give him that electric chair, if those new pending charges were voted on. No, I guess he'll never get out. I guess my mind is just playing the old psychological tricks on me. Yes, it's something to actually live through, something like that, and I hope time will heal my wounds. No, I have no reason to worry about him getting out, do I? No reason. No reason to worry. Nothing to worry about. Everything's going to be fine, but all my friends are dead, and he's coming to get me. No, I have no reason to worry about him getting out, do I? (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (Reaper breathing) (light synth music) (light synth music) (light synth music) (light synth music) (light synth music) (light synth music) (light synth music) (light synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) - I think it's time to go. - Yeah, it looks like it's going to rain. - Hurry up. I don't want to get wet, you guys. (suspenseful synth music) - Well, uh... Well, I had a good to get time anyway. Didn't y'all? - [Julie] Yes, I did. I hope this car holds up. - [Jill] Oh, no! I think she's overheating again! That's a Pontiac for ya. Yeah, I can take a look around if you want but I think I better stay here and watch it. - Where are we anyway? - Hey, let's take a walk around and see what we can find. (suspenseful synth music) - Jennifer, let's check this place out. - Are you sure you really want to go in there? - I really don't know. (laughs) (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (Reaper breathing) (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) What's that? - I don't know. - Hey, guys, let's get out of here. (Jill screams) He's got Jill at the car! (suspenseful synth music) (Reaper gobbling) (eerie synth music) - Julie, Julie! Come on, get up! (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) - See if you can start the car, I'm gonna go help Cheryl. (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (tires screeching) (eerie synth music) - Don't do it! That's going down to his level, killing unmercifully! Let the authorities handle it. (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (Reaper breathing) (suspenseful synth music) So Inspector Rosenberg, after this fight, we tied him up here and went for help. For you, I guess. - I'm glad you did. And I'm sorry about your friend. You know, I think this is a major breakthrough, in a case that we've been working on for five years now. If this guy has been eating his victims then that would explain a good hundred or so of the victims we've been unable to find in this area. It's sick, but this definitely looks like our man. - Heather, I've got to go. I've given my name and account of what happened, and Julie's pretty shook up. I'm going to see her and Jennifer, okay? - Okay. I'll be along in a while. - [Detective Rosenberg] Are all of you all right? - Yes, except Jill. - Well, up in the woods there, I think we found at least the remains of 40 people there over in the sector, over there by the hill, beyond the horizon there. And the canvas is still going. Apparently, this guy eats humans to survive. This definitely explains all the missing persons we had in the area, and he's sadistic maniac. We'll transport him upstate soon. Hopefully, we'll nail this so-and-so to the cross, 'cause we don't want people like this running around loose in our area, in this town. We don't accept that. We don't need that kind of behavior. And anyway, I'm gonna need your name and address and where you work, for testimonial reasons. - Well, I work at the Fireside Inn. I make out checks and such at the front office. I'm off on Fridays though. My day off. - We'll be getting back to you. (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) - You guys all right? - I am. Julie's still a little in shock, but the doctor gave her a sedative. She's in the hospital now. - I'm fine. I just twisted my ankle. How about you Heather? - I'm shaking, but I'll make it. What about Jill's funeral arrangements? - Her parents are so shaken up, that they've decided to have a private closed-casket ceremony. - I guess we can pay our last respects at the cemetery. - Jennifer, you're welcome to stay here if you want. - No. I guess it's better to get back to normality for everyone. Julie can stay with me for a few days, okay? - Yeah, you're right. Bye, Jennifer. Take care of yourself. (light synth music) (door knocking) - Hi, Don. - Are you all right? I heard about the incident on the news this afternoon. - I'm okay. I still can't believe Jill's dead. - I know that was an experience. I have to go to a real estate convention today. - What are you talking... What are you talking about? - Well, I have to go to a real estate convention today and there's no way possible that I can take you. I'd like to put you in one of the rooms in that hotel I purchased not too long ago. And, well, I'd feel safer, knowing that you were there. - Sounds good. I'll pack some things, and you can drop me off there. - That's okay. I leave at 3:00. - Are you okay, Julie? I mean, we went through something that not many people experience. - I feel tired, but I'm going to make it. I'm not gonna be some shell-shocked woman because of this. - I'm glad. What are you planning to do, get back with Peter? - Maybe. But first, I'm going to take some time off and go to the beach. Do you think that's a good idea? - For me, yes. I must overcome these fears and recover from this incident alone. You know me, I'll flow back into the swing of things. - I trust you. Tomorrow, I may get my hair done or something. Are we still going out tonight? - Yeah. See you later, around five o'clock. Okay, bye. (eerie synth music) - Hi, come on in. - Just thought I'd stop by before work. So what are you planning to do today on your big day off? Big vacation city. - Yeah, well, this is just that (indistinct) I've been meaning to get, and Daniel might call later. - Sounds good. Oh yeah, I think Julie will be fine. I talked to Jennifer this morning, and Julie has it all worked out with herself. You know, getting out of the initial shock and getting over the fear of going to the beach. You know? It's like I'm paranoid to go anywhere. - Well, it should pass. - I got to get going. - Okay, bye. (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Hello? - [Jennifer] Hi, this is Jennifer. I can't find Julie anywhere. We were supposed to go out to dinner tonight, with Bill and Frank, but she's not here. She went from the beach earlier. Have you heard from her? - No, I haven't. Come on over, and we'll try and find her. - [Jennifer] Okay. I'll see you soon. - Okay, bye. (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (intense synth music) (suspenseful synth music) - Donald, are you in the shower? - I'm in the shower! (water splashing) - I'm kinda tired! I think I'll take a nap! (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (water splashing) (eerie synth music) - [Donald] Who's there? (eerie synth music) - Donald, are you all right? (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (intense synth music) - We got word of his escape early this morning. He's left quite a carnage here, and I'm glad you came here first, so we can catch him. If you're the last one left he wants to kill out of that group of people, then I think we can use you as kind of like bait. And then when he attacks you, and I think he will attack you, no matter where you are, somehow he's found all of your friends and probably you, we'll catch this guy as soon as he attacks you. Okay? - Okay. (suspenseful synth music) - Okay. when he comes, I'll be ready for him, So you just sit tight here. Don't be afraid, because we're right here, right behind you. It's time to end this insanity. Don't worry about anything. (intense synth music) Hey, punk! You have the right to remain silent. Thought you were gonna get away with this (indistinct) This town doesn't isn't like any other town, punk. (laughs) We got you now. (strange synth music) (strange synth music) (creepy synth music) (creepy synth music) (high intensity synth music) (Reaper breathing) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (Reaper growling) (high energy synth music) (wind blowing) (high energy synth music) (wind blowing) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (Reaper growling) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (body thuds) (eerie synth music) (wind blowing) (eerie synth music) (strange synth music) (strange synth music) (strange synth music) (eerie synth music) - Detective Rosenberg? I need to see you. Where should I meet you? At the station? All right. I'll see you then. Bye. (eerie synth music) Detective Rosenberg? - Yes? What can I do for you? - I'm Jennifer Morgan. I just called you. - Oh, okay. Let's go over here, where we can talk. It's been a while. We'll go over and talk at this table over here. It's kind of vacant right now. Have a seat, but don't take it home. So what can I do for you on this wonderful afternoon? It's been a long day. What's up? - I think he's trying to kill me again. - (laughs) What? What are you talking about? This is a small town. Who's trying to kill you? You don't mean that killer that was captured 13 months ago. Do you? - Yes. I think he escaped. How long has he been in there? How did he get out? - As far as I know, he hasn't gotten out. He's on death row right now. - No, he just chased me. It was him, believe me. Why don't you believe me? He just chased me down the street. You never listen to a word I say. - Well, I'm trying, but he's scheduled, according to the news and authorities, to be executed. They took him down there the other day. And as far as I know, he's on his way to be killed. That's fine with me. In this town, we just can't deal with people like you running in here saying you have a killer on your trail, because there is no killer, as far as I know. It's ridiculous to think that he's escaped, because I know for a fact that he's just been taken down to be executed and that's it. And they're going to kill him, and he's not back. He's not alive. He didn't escape. - Well, he escaped. I know he escaped. I'm the only one left. He killed all of them. - Well, listen to me. I can't believe this. You come in here, yelling at me that somebody is trying to kill you, and-- - No, listen... - No, you listen to me for a change here. We've been through this once before and there was no killer at all. I think it's in your imagination, I really do. Because I mean, after an incident like that, your mind tends to over-exaggerate on things. And this town, I know, does not have any killers on the loose, going around after people like you. I think you have some psychological problems that you must deal with. And really, in all due respect and honesty, I think you should really have these dealt with by some kind of psychiatrist or something, because there is no-- - No, I'm not crazy. I think you may be a little bit over-exaggerating. We got court cases backed up, all the way to city hall. We even had a shoplifting the other day, down at the new mall that just opened, which really annoyed me. These punks already moving into the neighborhood. [Det. Rosenberg] So what I suggest you do is go see Dr. Paul Bloch, a good friend of mine. He can help you out with your whole situation, about seeing killers and all that business that you just told me. Because I know the guy is not out on the loose. Just go see this Dr. Paul Bloch. He's a good friend of mine. - I must be crazy if he wants me to see a psychiatrist. (eerie synth music) (wind howling) (suspenseful synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) - [TV Newsman] Early this morning, while authorities attempted to transport the cannibal killer to death row, he surprisingly escaped, brutally killing both Eisen House Mental Institution guards that were escorting him. He is at-large now. More news after these messages. (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (eerie synth music) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (suspenseful synth music) - (gasps) Dr. Bloch? - [Dr. Bloch] Uh, yeah, I think so. (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) - Detective Rosenberg said you could help me. - Yes, I think so. You've come to the right place, or person, or both. You're safe for now. Our friend has been hit by a car, beaten by a bat, shot, stabbed and mutilated. It's definitely the Reaper. I've been waiting for him a long time. You see, I've been expecting him. - I don't understand. - Well, I'll explain all this to you. I need your help in getting the Reaper. - Who's the Reaper? - He's commonly known as the cannibal murderer. - Please, explain. I don't understand. - Well, I've got this book that explains everything. It's called "The Festival of the Sanguinary". - The what? - "The Festival of the Sanguinary". The sanguinary applies to either the act of shedding blood or to the spirit that delights in bloodshed. This book has been my guide. It tells of the seven-year cycle change. (indistinct) - Explain, please. - It is a spirit not of this earth that invades an earthly soul every seven years. - You see, it's known from studies that every seven years, people's ideas, outlooks, opinions, everything changes. (indistinct) age of 18 or so. Every seven years, a person's values, ethics, everything he cares about can change. Marriages are inclined to break up in seven-year periods, our job changes, just about everything. As a person changes, his emotions spread beyond comprehension. I'm not saying that this happens to everyone. But when it happens to the right person, a person with violent temperament inside him, the specter of the sanguinary enters his soul, turning him into a sick and demented form that preys on human flesh. Eventually, he will end the human race with pure evil. There hae been six sanguinary evolutions throughout human history. Every one of them has been intercepted by the beholder of this book. [Dr. Bloch] The seventh... (eerie synth music) - Dr. Bloch? (eerie synth music) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) - You see, the seventh specter is the last. And if he's stopped, we'll rid the world of the Festival of the Sanguinary phenomenon. We'll be at peace with this menace and a wild utopia of sorts, or something. Will you help me stop this last victim, the one that you know as the Reaper? I believe we have been chosen to rid the word of its evil. Do you know what I'm talking about at all? This is a very complex psychological situation here. - What can I do to help? - You can be bait. He's after you and your friends, now just you, because you brought him into the light of the human race. If he sees you, he'll attack, He's looking for you. And when he finds you, we'll be ready. - Okay, I'll go along with it for now, but I'm not sure why. - The first thing we must do is release Argento. - Who? What's an Argento? The hope for humanity, the savior of the world. Each sanguinary then has to be stopped by a greater power that's created by good. To stop the Reaper one final time, I have trained someone of his match, to against him and destroy him. This someone is a patient of mine called Argento. He's a masked murderer of sorts, who was committed to our institution for rehabilitation. I've worked with him and programmed him, you might say, to destroy The Reaper as it's explained in "The Festival of the Sanguinary." He was once a sadistic murderer, and now he's the savior of humanity. Ironic, isn't it? They tried to put him in the electric chair several times, but it didn't kill him. It just weakened his state of mind and opened him to my manipulation. Now all of his concentrations are melded into destroying this one, great, evil force, known as the Reaper. This is the ultimate confrontation between humanity and evil. Let's ready ourselves. (high energy synth music) (strange synth music) Now, do as I told you, destroy the Reaper. You must cut out the heart and eat it. That, and only that, will put an end to this madness. (strange synth music) Attack, destroy him. Do as I taught you. Humanity rides upon this. I have full confidence in you. Cut out the heart. You must destroy this madman before he destroys the world. (suspenseful synth music) (strange synth music) (suspenseful synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) (indistinct) That looked painful. (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (high energy synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) To finish what he started, I must cut out the heart. (high energy synth music) (intense synth music) (intense synth music) - [Voice] Join the forces of the Sanguinary. Join the reincarnation of the Reaper in Dr. Bloch. The Sanguinary has [indistinct].
