♪Subs K. Svanholm corrected resynced by♪ XQ2☻♥ THE 100 YEAR OLD MAN Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared The one who has meant the most in my life... is Molotov. Yeah. Oops! Well go out, then. Hop out. It gets cold quick in here, if you pussyfoot like that. Dinner will be in an hour. Meow so I can hear, to let you in. Molotov! Come inside. Come have a bite to eat. Molotov! No! No, no, no. No, no, no! No, no.♥ Bastard! Sonofabitch! Fucking fox. You've played your last trick. Here comes your goddamn just desserts! And just like that, I blasted myself right into a nursing home. 61 - How's it going? - 62... Now, I lost count. How many in each packet? - It says, ten per packet. - You can't trust that. - It's usually right. - I'll have to start over from the beginning. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. ♪ Long, may he live Yes, may he live for 100 years ♪ Surely, he'll live... Allan? Allan? Allan? Allan? Allan? Oh my God, where is he? - Where's the old guy? - Where'd he go? Hi. Is there a... Can you travel out of town from here? - Where'd you say you're going? - I didn't. Is there a means of transport out of here? - Ah... When? - Well... Anytime. Is anything leaving from here? The bus to Strängnäs, in about 3 minutes. - Strängnäs? - Number 322. Will that do? Yeah. Is this enough? No, but it may get you as far as Byringe. - What's in Byringe? - Not a damn thing. Fine! A single to Byringe, please. And you are... over 65? - What? - Yes. Let's see... - Here you go. - Thank you. Fucking shit! Come on! What the fuck! What the hell were they thinking? - Hold my suitcase. Don't let it go. - B-but... - Shut, the fuck, up! Yeah. The old man must've gone up in smoke. The basement's dark and locked. He couldn't have come down here. We must ring the police. Will you, or shall I? You call. Allan! Allan. I've been yelled at by many people: from railway conductors to dictators. Where the hell are you, old-fart? Fuck! Allan. The first one to scream at me, was my mother. I don't remember her screaming, but surely, she must have. I probably screamed too. That's what newborns do, when they first look around. I never heard my old man scream, much. - Karlsson you've blasphemed! - For displaying a rubber? The solution to hunger and strife. You call that blaspheming?! Yes, if you do it on Children's Day in Malmköping City Square... - I must warn people. - ...then, it's blasphemy! I was nine the last time I saw him. I can't live in this hypocritical monarchy. I'm going to Russia. Father proclaimed an independent republic on 15 square meters in the center of Moscow. This is the solution to hunger and misery. With this, a woman can't get pregnant. No children. "Nyet". It's fantastic! - There, father could do as he pleased. - What are you doing? - Until the Russkies took care of him. - It's the solution to hunger and misery! May I say one last thing? Flatfoot, flatfoot! - Flatfoot. - Mrs. Karlsson. Word of father's death, came on a sunny April day. The same day I discovered the joy of blowing things up. All that father left behind, arrived in a single package. Mother got a colored egg, made by some guy called "Fabber". I got one of those Russian babushka dolls. And a camera. They were good presents. Mother swapped the egg at Gustavsson's Wholesale Store. He got the better end of the deal, as wholesalers always do. After father died, mother coughed for two years, before she went to the alleged Heaven, where father supposedly was. It made me a bit uneasy about the future. That's how it is, when a kid is about to become an orphan. - How will I cope? - You sound like your father. He thought a lot, too. See how he ended up? Thinking gets you nowhere. All we know for sure is: things are what they are, and will be what they will be. Those were mother's last words. Since then, I've had to fend for myself. - Hallo! Hallo! - Huh? - You forgot your case. - All right. There are no trains here. It's closed. - What did you say? - There are no trains here. - The station is closed. - Yeah. I see that. I wasn't born yesterday. - What are you doing here, then? - The bus stopped here. So, where the hell are you going, then? Going? Well, no, that is... We'll see. - Been a vagrant for long? - Vagrant? You're lugging a lot of baggage. This isn't mine. It just followed me. - You're an old thief, then? - Yeah, well... - Are you hungry? - I'm... Mostly, I'm thirsty. - We'll soon fix that. - Yeah, lovely. - Do you know this area? - I often jog here. - Fuck, if I care! - I know the area. - Can you find your way? - Yes, I know the area. - Damned, lucky for you! Fuck... - What are you doing? What's the problem? - It's out of gas. Got a fucking gas canister? There's only one house in Byringe! It's brown... light brown! It has some yellow, too! - Could he have lost his way? - No, his noggin's pretty sharp. There's nothing wrong with the old man's head. How could someone sneak off at his own party? I put in so much effort for him, and he just disappears. We bought a Princess Cake for at least 40 people. We ordered it special, because he likes marzipan. The others have cream cakes. Marzipan sticks in their teeth. What'll we do with it? I'm stuck with a huge cake, for old folks who can't eat marzipan. I prefer Black Forest cake, but it's not MY birthday. Call me if he comes back. These kinds of cases usually resolve quickly. Did he hop out the window? It was open as we came in singing. So, it was actually open. I don't know, it's possible. - It'll be OK. - I don't think so. Damned nursing home! They've arranged for me to go there in the fall. I only set foot in there once. If you can drink four, you can drink one more. I went, intending to entertain the old folks with my accordeon. They just sat with their mouths open. - So, you play the accordeon? - Yes. Poor wretches, just sat there. I'd rather sit in an outhouse. - Cheers, again. - Damn, I forgot. Down the hatch. Got an old lady? - No, it never worked out. - How'd you manage to avoid it? Do you piss outside, here? I need to make room for the next round. It's urgent. Good, that hit the spot! We have dessert, too. Yeah... Be right back. Hello? Anyone there? Hello? - Where's the old fart with my case? - It's closed. The station's closed. - Where's the old fart with my case? - I live alone here. Think I'm stupid? Who the fuck sat here, then? - No... Ayii! - Old sonofabitch! - Watch it! - Ayii! - Ayii! Stop it. - Sonofabitch. - Watch it! - I'll kill you! Oh! Stop. Ai-aiy! Shall we flip a coin to see if you get to live? Stop now. Calm down. Lucky for you, I don't have any coins. In the hall there's loose change in a bowl. The hall?! Are you so stupid to think I'd fall...? - Helluva whack! - You're telling me! How about that dessert, is it still on? - We need to get rid of him before he comes to. - Yeah. I must admit, I'm starting to get curious about... ...what's in the suitcase. There, that's the fastest way... Oops, too much! I'll drink it. ...to open it, even if you know the combination. Do you drink it straight? Oh, Goddamn! What a lot of cash! No wonder the kid was upset. Open up, Goddammit! Do you hear me old man? Let me out! - I just want that damn case. - Calm down. I won't hit you... serious. - What was that noise? - I turned on the cooler. I'll just take the fucking case and go, I won't hit you. A pretty promise from a guy caught in shit. Not worth much. Life is what it is, and will be what it will be. Gustavsson, the wholesaler, learned that, the hard way. Wait here, Bibi. Come back soon. He'd planned his escapade well. He chose a sunny day, a lovely road, a perfect hill for his piss break. Still, it all went tits up. I had chosen the same hill for my nuclear test. She screamed bloody murder. As mistresses tend to do, when it's raining wholesalers' heads. The test blast was successful, but it became my ticket into a mental hospital. So... this is your room. No fuss and racket here! After a few years behind bars I ended up in the care of a Race Biologist. Professor Lundborg. Stop it, Allan. [Norrbotten Lapplander]...[Negro musician USA. Deported] Do you know if there's negro blood in your family? - No, I don't think so. - I can't make sense of it. Allan, you have Negroid measurements, you're prone to violence, yet, you're very light skinned. But, Professor, I'd love to meet a negro. "Allan's father had a revolutionary nature." He was a bit special. Seems the apple hasn't fallen far from the tree. Better to be safe than sorry. Lundborg set up his tools, and saw to it that my tool did not pass on my genes. - Doctor, the patient is ready. - Yeah. And he did what Race Biologists do well. Give him extra bandaging. He was not so steady-handed but I understand, the operation went well. - 49 million 800 thousand - Here's the last one. - 49 million 900 thousand - And this. - 50 million! - You count well. Not bad! Still can't reach him? His fucking phone is on the fritz. Just call or text him. Do your job, for once! - What's he supposed to do? - Pick-up a case. - Pick up what? - A suitcase! - Suitcase? - Yeah, a suitcase, Hinken! You know, a portable space to keep stuff in. - Why couldn't you get it? - What about this, thing? - I forgot the ankle monitor. - Well, I, fucking, didn't. - Is it Bulten*? (Bolt) - I'll take it. Shut the fuck up! I'll do the talking. Shut up. - Hello, Gäddan*, here. (Pike) - Yeah, hello, mate. How's it going? Shit-good, no problem! What is clock for you? We have 12 in the evening. Never mind about the clocks. You were supposed to ring me earlier, weren't you? Why didn't you ring me earlier? Yes, I know, but (fuck) I had some mobile battery trouble. Listen mate... Calm down. Calm down, mate. You're stumbling you're mumbling. You're talking gibberish. Maybe you could hand the phone to somebody who can talk to, properly. Loaders for mobile. OK, wait. I give the phone for Caracas. - Yes give her the phone - Hold on. Wait. Caracas, bitch! Telephone. Come! - Who is it? - Shh! Pim! How are you? Never mind how I am. Have you got my cash? - We have it. - What do you mean? One of my guys has the dough. Tell him we have it. No problem. Caracas, are you there? Hello? Hello. Bulten has it. Good, so everything's fine, then, you've got it? He is not here yet but he will be here soon. Don't worry. Just give the bag to my courier by tomorrow. Otherwise you're dead. I told you to say one fucking thing, that we have the money! Is it so, fucking, hard? Another world record fuck-up! Go to Malmköping and fetch that idiot. And don't fuck up! I'm serious! - Java? - Yes, thanks. Treo. (aspirin) - Did you sleep well? - Yes. Has he made a racket this morning? No, not a peep. Minus 20! Holy shit! - Goddamit, what have I done? - What? Hell! How could I forget to turn off the cooler? Oh, you... Yes, the... It'll work itself out. Regret is pointless, unless you have a time machine. Regret has never undone anything regrettable. I never regretted having my operation. On the contrary, it was a stroke of luck. If I hadn't had a sore crotch I wouldn't have stopped at the cannon foundry. And I'd never have gotten a job there. We cast gunbarrels. We're a man short. Watch and learn how he does it for a week. Esteban! Shut up and work! Si, si, si. We must work together for a better world. The Spaniard, Esteban, was thin as a rake. - He used his mouth only for talking. - Join the war against Franco. Allan, which side are you on? Which one? You must take a stand. You must give me an answer. I just like to blow stuff up. We must do something. When civil war broke out in Spain he wanted me to go with him and crush a guy named Franco. And why not? In war, you get to blow up all kinds of stuff. Viva la revolucion. Viva Durutti. Viva la Espana [SPAN] Where are you going? Come with me, let's form a Brigade. Durutti says... - Hitler is a good man. - We must stop him. [ENG] - I want to sleep! - One momentito! No time for sleep! We must fight against Franco. We'll die, rather than give up. [SP] Viva la revolucion! Viva la revolucion! Raise the Republican flag and open your hearts to the revolution. [SP] When we got there, [SW] the first bullet hadn't yet been fired... Death to Fascism! Death to Franco! ...until Esteban let out his last shout. Then, my mother's wise words came back to me. The poor guy never got to blow up any bridges. But, I got to blow up all the more. And "tres, dos, uno". BANG, motherfuckers! Allan, duck, Goddammit! For many years I did nothing, but, eat, sleep and blow up stuff. It was a wonderful time! But it was too much of a good thing. Eventually I lost my taste for explosions. So, I thought: "To hell with this shit. I'll do something else." After slogging all over Spain blowing it up, catching a ride out is a welcome opportunity. Para! (Stop) Why is he in the middle of the road? Stop the car! [SP] Stop, stop! It turned out to be General Franco, [SW] out for a Sunday drive. He appreciated my flagging down his car and invited me to a gala dance, paella and all the Rioja I could drink. It was a perfect ending to my time in Spain. My friend, Allan, you saved my life. [SP] And I give you my favorite pistol. Oh, fancy! [SW] - Make good use of it. [SP] - Gracias. Senor, I wonder how well it shoots. [SW] This is the way to dance! [SP] Relax, everyone! It's my friend, Allan. Tell me, Allan, what will you miss most from our glorious land? The wine and my friend, Esteban... who is dead. - Long live Esteban! - Long live Esteban! - What's that beeping? [SW] - Probably a telephone. There, see. Let's see. He's receiving a lot of SMS messages. - Right now? - The signal's poor inside there. From Gäddan, from Hinken, Hinken, Hinken*. (Bucket) - Hinken, Mama. Hinken, Gäddan. - He seems popular. Sort of... Hinken writes: "Ring me, or die." Oh, hell! - Hello? - I'm at the station. It's totally empty. Just a weirdo at the ticket booth. - What should I do? - Have you asked him? - Ask him what? - If he saw anything. Ah, OK, I'll ask. Ronny Hult and wife are here. Meet your own visitors, next time. Sorry, I didn't know they'd arrived. - Hello. - Please have a seat. Tell me, what happened yesterday? I was working at the station... a few hours passed by... Just tell him what happened. - That's what I'm doing. - You're not doing it very well. OK, a guy jumped me. He was very violent. - You forgot about the old man. - Yeah, but... There was an old man. - I sold a ticket to a man... - He was 100-years old. The 100-year-old man bought a ticket from Ronny. - Yeah. Then, a biker roughed up Ronny... and forced him to drive to Byringe. Yeah. Hello? Anybody home? Do you know what time it is? Yeah. - It's almost eleven. - Good. They'll be breaking for lunch, soon. Hello, hello! - Hi. - Bye. Aha. Ouch, that could've hurt. Death has its advantages. So... OK... - Should we dump everything? - Heave it all out! - Now, what? - He goes in there. Nngh! Damn! OK. Dji--Djibouti. Oh, yeah. He'll get to see the world. The advantage of vests is: one size fits all. OK... We got that hassle out of the way! - What? - Julius, help me pull the suitcase. - We're both in this together. - Hell, yeah! Sure. You take that. Thank you. Hello, you there! Hello there! Hold on a minute. I'm from the police. I'm... I'm looking for a... a 100-year-old man, who's strayed from the nursing home. - Have you seen any old-timers? - I saw an old man on a handcar. He went past with Jonsson. - Was that Julius Jonsson? - Exactly. They was another guy with them in a motorcyclist's vest. Kinda snooty, with sunglasses. Didn't, even, greet me. Such manners, nowadays! - Where did you see them? - At the soccer field in Åkers Styckebruk. - How long since you saw them? - About half an hour. - Are you sure? - No. "No"... Bye. You... uh... Hello. Got room for two hitchhikers? Uh... - Hey. - Hey, hey. - Um, yeah, I guess it's OK. - Great! - It's pretty cramped back here. - I'll put the case in front. - Where are you going? - Is that your Kiosk? No, just a part time job. I go to school, otherwise. A student? Not high school, I assume. No, I've dabbled in several fields. Studied quite a few things. I figure it's a pretty tough question... employment opportunities being what they are. - How's that? - No, it's just... There are, like, different... I mean... - I figure that... - What? I figure it's hard to make choices. How... It's great to keep all doors open. Yeah, well... Oh, the hell with it. - Hop in. - Thank you! So, where are you headed? Um... Where are you headed? - To the wholesaler's for supplies. - Wholesaler? Sounds great. Are you sure? It's in the middle of nowhere. The middle of nowhere is greatly underrated. Yeah, maybe so. Why don't you sponsor a local ad? - It'd be perfect! - What? Yeah, Skandia is 150 years old, and the geezer is 100. It'd be great. You being a cop could do something nutty with it. - No, I won't. - But, they're both old. NO, do you hear? I'm a policeman for fuck's sake. But, it'd be great! Forget it, I'm a government employee! I can't do a fucking ad for this shitty radio station. Here's a blast from the past: the 70s. Remember 'The Police' with 'Message In A Bottle'? - Well, I have police officer Aronsson in the studio. - Inspector! Welcome. You have a message for the public, but not in a bottle? - Eh, no. No? Tell us a bit about it. It concerns a man named Allan Karlsson, who, on his hundredth birthday disappeared from his nursing home in Malmköping. Oi-oi, 100 years old? Damn! And still playing hide and seek? No, we believe he was kidnapped by bikers at the Malmköping station. Kidnapped... wow! Sounds like a stag party. Was he about to marry Anna Nicole Smith? We'd appreciate any tips from the public. Thank you for coming. - Hello. - Hey, I'm sitting in my car. And some cop on the radio's going on about a 100-year-old man kidnapped by a biker gang. - The hell you say?! Kidnapped? - It's true. It was just on the radio. It must be Bulten! Fucking, Bulten! You're a dead man, Bulten! That's good! - You want something? - Eh... No, I'm good. [Police suspect centenarian kidnapped] [100 year old kidnapped by BIKER GANG] To fill up... pull the lever. Pull the lever, or no gas comes out. Pull the lever at the pump. - No. - You must pull the lever at the pump! You never fueled a car before? Gotta pull the lever or you won't get any gas. - Did he kidnap you? - What? Who? - Julius! - No, no. You must pull the lever. The headline says you were kidnapped by a biker gang. Julius is wearing a biker vest I just saw it. No, the vest isn't his. He took it from the bald kid. A little kid? He won't need it anymore, he's dead. I hit him on the head with a croquet mallet. - You killed him? - No, he froze to death. - OK... - The bald kid... the little bald kid He was all sweaty. Probably had the running shits. He wasn't feeling well. He shoved a suitcase in my hand, with 50 million in it. What? Drive! Floor it! GO! - He doesn't know how to fill-up. - Fuck that, just go! Drive! Benny, pedal to the metal! Let's roll! - The old bat at the till saw me. - Saw what? This little bag fell into my pocket. Wanna taste? Yes please. So, you went shoplifting? - What the hell?! - What? What the hell's going on? I apologize. You work in a kiosk... ...obviously, my shoplifting would piss you off. He can't break a stash of millions just for a bag of sweets. Fuck the candy! What, the hell, have you done?! Huh?... What the fuck?! I'll never do a public appeal on radio, again. It tunred into a mess. - No, it didn't go well. - Why do I do these things? - We heard from Ăkers Styckebruk. - Yeah? The dog sniffed a corpse on the handcar. - Corpse? - Oh, yeah! Benny, what do you say? Why not skip the wholesaler's and come with us instead? Or do you have an exam on Monday? What'll you do with the money? -"WE" will split it up, eh? - Yeah! Can we talk about that later? We're parked in a bad spot. Would you just drive? But whose money is it? It's not our money, it belongs to someone else. Who else? What really belongs to whom? Everything in the world changes hands sooner or later. Like that six-shooter I got from Franco. I traded it for a work permit when I got to America. Hey, Allan! You know they're looking for people, right? - For fuck's sake, who? - Yeah, for the Manhattan project. Manhattan, what? Manhattan project? Yeah man, the Manhattan project, Allan. You ask me, I think, when we get a chance, we gotta try and get us an interview or something. You see my fuckin' hammer up there? Sounds like damn good idea.[SWE] What you say man? Me and you, can make a change. That is very good, that's a good project. It's time that someone does something about it. It's bitter. Bitter? Man what, the fuck, you talkin'bout? Th-the Manhattan. - Here... - Aahh, shit! For fuck's sake, who dropped the hammer? You know, you drink it. The Manhattan drink. Man, what the hell you mean, man? Tastes like kissing a dog's ass.[SWE] Bitter. It's a bomb! The biggest bomb on earth. It's a bomb project? And suddenly, my 'explosive' urge returned. I must say, it was a wonderful feeling. It's not gonna work. We tried that last week. - Maybe some coffee will help. - Oh, thanks. Still no bomb today, I guess? Mr. Oppenheimer, I really must say, I'm quite disappointed. Nothing happens here. No explosions. Nothing. - You're name's Allan, yeah? - Allan. Allan, this is not just any bomb. We need to figure out some pretty complicated things here. No no, you have to keep on testing. You have to start testing again. As my mother used to say: "Don't think so much, just do it" Yeah, but what your mom didn't tell you is that, to detonate this bomb, we need to solve a minor but crucial fucking problem. Yeah, what's the problem? - Allan, I'm gonna give you a minute, OK? - Oh, good. For what we're going for, we need to use twice as much plutonium as we're using now. So, what are you waiting for? We can't just add twice as much plutonium, it's unstable, it just falls apart. It's simple physics. I know, you've been talking about this for weeks now. But listen, I give you a minute OK? - OK. I had a little theory on this. What if you take half here... and half there, and put it together, one second, just before the explosion. Yeah, now, that's the problem. How are we gonna do that with a falling bomb, encased in metal, up in the air? Hell, we have some dynamite! And that's all it took to detonate 'The Bomb'. [SW] Everyone was over the moon. None, more so than Harry. Yeah, Vice President Harry S. Truman. I'm gonna buy you the biggest drink you have ever drunk! - Thank you. I have a pee stain. You know, you've done mankind a great service, my friend. - You listening to me? - Forgot to shake it You have done... You have changed the world. You have changed the world for the better. - It's aways that last drop. - Listen to me! - Yeah, I'm listening. There'll be no more wars after this invention of yours. Thanks to you my friend. Boom! America and the world will never have to fight again because people will know the power, the awesome power... Gentlemen, I'm sorry to interrupt you. - Mr. Truman! - What is it? There's a phone call. It's a phone call you have to take. I've gotta take this. Never go into politics. 'Yellow'! A fully tanked up American can talk the ear off anyone. Lord knows. [SW] It takes a lot to shut him up. Like, say, a president dropping dead. Jesus Christ! Alright, be right there. And that's precisely what Roosevelt did that day. Now... Here! Hey, Haar..Harry! You forgot your... It's a Vice-presidential lighter. You keep it. Well, Harry wasn't too picky about what belongs to whom. [SW] Welcome back. - Mr. Karlsson. - Yeah, Allan. - Welcome back to Sweden! No no, Prime Minister Erlander wants to offer a welcome-dinner. I'd barely set foot on the ground, when I was shanghaied to that schmooze dinner at the Grand Hotel. It suited me just fine after that damned airline food. - Great, I'm quite peckish. - Quick get in! So the soldier got up and said: "Duck, you old geezers and grannies, he's reloading!" I heard from, no less than, Harry S. Truman, that Allan is an exceedingly decent chap, who performed great services for America. I dunno about that, but, we had one hell of a party! Tell me, I'm very curious! We sat and drank tequila. Loads of tequila. Yeah, yeah, I'm talking about what happened before. Before that, we drank tequila, too. Harry wanted bourbon, but that's sissy stuff. Mr. Karlsson, please, I'm referring to the work. Oh, you mean when I worked on Manhattan? I didn't drink any tequila, then. It'd be totally reckless. Goes straight to your head. Excuse me gentlemen, I must leave you. It's very interesting but Government calls. My wife, that is! Stop that! The check's on me. Continue briefing engineer Eklund. Enjoy! - Ah... Bye. The Prime Minister asked me... You think he's coming back? - No. Then I'll take this piece of meat. Shame if it went to waste. The Prime Minister has asked me... to see if there might be a position for you at the Atomic Energy Department. - How nice! - So, let's begin with your studies. Not much to brag about. Three years. Only 3 years of academic studies?! - Yeah. I dropped out when I was nine. - Nine? - Right... er... no, ten... I was ten. No wait,... that was the year, I turned ten. So I was nine when I left school. Here's another little one down the hatch. You can take his drink. Eklund disappeared quicker than shit through a chicken. But he wasn't the only one 'fishing' at the Grand, so to speak. Good evening, Mr. Karlsson. I'm Popov, Yuri Popov. I'm a physicist. We are colleagues. Maybe we should take walk. Together. It seems like we need some fresh air. What the hell, "a walk"? - Hey Popov! - Coming. Hup, hup, hold it Missy! [SW] You got some nice stuff here. Grönstedts... I think, I'll take the schnapps. You pay for this. Give her a fifty. - How much? - Fifty, fifty. Yeah fifty. Thanks. Oi, that's got some bite! It's kicking in, now. I feel awesome! No, no Allan, we'd just like you to share some of your experience and knowledge with us. - Uh, you don't say? - It could be very lucrative for you. But... eh, but why? How shall I say? Comrade Stalin is a very nice man. Oh yeah? I just like to blow up things. - Yes, I like this too! - You, you do? Yes. Just give me some dynamite and I blow up anything. Fuckin' shit! Damn! What the hell's that doing here? Within the Inner Archipelago? [SW] We're low on gas. - Go in here! - Yeah, do that. Sjötorp? Sounds quaint! (Lake cottage) Hello! - Hey, hey! - Hiya! We're wondering if we could rent a room for the night. This isn't a bloody hotel. I live in here! But we'll pay handsomely. Money's no object. What the hell, are you on the lam? There's no need for concern. I know it seems strange. - Huh? - We're lost. - Another little old man? We drove around like crazy, and we'd be very grateful if you'd put us up. - Allan. - Hi, there. Gunilla. - Charmed. Well, now, let's see... I guess I could squeeze you in. As long as none of you pees themselves, or you'll have to sleep in the barn. - What's that? - Oh, that's Sonja. What have we here? Aha! Hey, there. Not bad! There, there! Come, Sonja! What is she, about 40 years old? - Sonja? - Yeah. - Haven't a clue, really. Why do you think that? I'm almost a zoologist and it seems about right. Almost? How the hell can you almost be? Well, I'm almost finished my education. - Where did you find her? - At a circus. Aha! Does she do tricks? I haven't got a fucking clue! - Circuses are simply cruelty to animals. - Yeah, absolutely! I hate circuses, too. It was the only good thing my ex did. He saw, how sorry I felt for her, and took the matter into his own hands. He, just, took her? Took? Doesn't an elephant own itself? Yeah. - Allan! - Huh? Listen... You can't do that. - Stop, stop, stop! - It hasn't got enough oomph! It's supposed to taste of barbecue. - What the hell is that? - French potato salad. Yeah, I see that. I mean the green goo. It looks good! - It's guacamole. - Hm! - Are you almost a cook too? - No, almost a dietician. Come off it, you're pulling my leg! Unfortunately, I'm almost many things. Almost a veterinarian... almost a macroeconomist, almost a pharmacist, almost a behaviourist. Damn! You're almost certainly single, too. You can't have time for women, at that rate! No... Or, rather, yeah. I am... Single, that is. I'm available. - Or were you kidding? - No, but you must be kidding. No. No. I spent the last 18 years getting 920 college credits. Holy shit! I had a hard time quenching my thirst for knowledge. Hell, you gotta stop fooling yourself. Or you'll end up going to hell in a handbasket. - You can't make something out of nothing. - Well that's one way to analyse it. What the hell are you doing here? - What? - What are you doing here? Eh... Just thought I'd pick up some stuff. You have nothing to pick up here! Yeah, I have... - My bowls. - What fucking bowls? The blue fucking bowls with flowers. Goddamit Ricky, are you taking back your birthday gift to me? I changed my mind. I want my bowls. Fuck off, Ricky! You're not supposed to be here. - Is he a good fuck? - Yeah, real nice! - He's the best. Real fuckin' good. - Yeah yeah, sure. He's very handy, but we call it "Making love". - Ricky. Hi! Congrats. - Thanks. Have a good one! No, you need to turn around. Yeah, that's it! Yes... No... Yeah, that'll do it. A little more... You'll have to... Um... Here you go. You can back up, here. You're doing fine. Back it up a bit more... That's it. Good. Let it up, man. He's riding the clutch. Gunilla, Gunilla! I don't know what the hell's wrong with me, always with such idiots. I must be drawn to them. Maybe you know. You must be almost a psychologist. No, not quite, almost. But I don't have far to go. I've taken the basic courses. I still need Neuropsychology, but it's a short one. It's hard to say what your problem is due to. But you can change your behaviour pattern... if you want. But, Benny, you can't choose who you fall in love with. No, unfortunately. Gunilla! It was you and me. You and me! - Yeah, hello? - Bro! Bro! - Hello, Ricky? - She left me, it's over. She's met someone else. Ricky listen, never mind your bride from hell! She's not a bride from hell, she's Gunilla! Listen to me, stop taking valium and the booze too. We'll deal with this crap tomorrow. - I can't do this. - Where are you? - I can't take any more! I bet she's fucking that damn centenarian, too! What did you say? Stop, stop. What centenarian? You've seen the centenarian? That damn geezer on TV who's a HUNDRED YEARS OLD! - Ricky... - AAAHH! Yeah... Two days ago I was sitting alone in my kitchen flipping a matchbox. All of a sudden, this old guy shows up, and now I'm sitting here. Huh? It's goddamn wonderful! One thing does leads to another. But, whether the other thing is better, you can never know. One thing I do know, is that submarines, prop-planes and vodka will make you sick to your stomach. That's for damn sure! Oh fuck! - Allan come on. - I'm sorry, what did you say? First we wanted Albert Einstein to help us. - Yes?...- You OK? - Yeah, yes. Well we found Mr Einstein. KGB picked him up in Geneva. Is it my stag party? How exciting! [GER] Quick, get in the car. [RUS] Wait, I'm not getting married. I don't even have a girlfriend. [GER] We found, later, out he was Herbert Einstein, - Albert's idiot brother. - A bomb?! Herbert Einsteins didn't share much more than the looks, with his brother. Comrade Stalin was very, kind of, disappointed. Yeah, I can believe that! [SW] So, we put our trust in you, Allan. The factory in Siberia isn't running! [RU] Who's responsible? I'm asking you! Idiots! Fools! It's not so good with marble when you have a headache. - What? - Marble: headache. He's screaming. - Yes, I see. Who's responsible? [RU] I want you to tell me, all you know about the atomic bomb. Comrade Stalin want's you to tell him everything you know about the nuclear bomb. Ahah, you don't say! [SW] Yeah, sure, sure. Why not? But, maybe, a little... A drink first? Yes, but, maybe, a drink first. [RU] Fine! One little drink and then you tell me everything! What the hell's he saying, Kalashnikov? [SW] One drink and then you tell me everything! That's the spirit! Good! [SW] Dance. Dance! [RU] Come on, dance! Quit nagging, you, fucking, madman. [SW] You sound like, just like Franco. - Franco, the fascist?! [RU] - Always nagging. It's boring, man. [SW] What's he talking about? - You know Franco? - Yes, yes, I saved his life. You saved the life [RU] of that little worm on horseback...? No no, wait. Your dance: beautiful, very good, more masculine. Franco he was dancing, you know, like this, like a woman. Let him say his last words. [RU] You may say your last words. Exactly. Listen, I... I don't think that men should dance, at all. Just woman. We don't all think alike. [SW] But, most of us would subscribe to the idea that gulag camps are real shit-holes. Then again, I got to meet some new people, too. Some, I knew just briefly... but that's where I became friends with Herbert! Yeah, Herbert Einstein. Like I said, one thing leads to another. - Hey, idiot! Put the stone back. [RU] - Yeah, yeah... Idiot. - Hello. - Hello! And the food, or rather the 'feed', was lousy. [SW] Nor did I ever get a whiff of vodka. Not even the tiniest sip. One day, I decided to get out of there. I had a good plan. Herbert was the only one who could roam around freely without getting shot because the guards were used to him getting lost and straying all the time. You pretend that you are going to the canteen, but you end up in the laundry. And there you steal two uniforms. - Go to the canteen? - No, no. Nein. You PRETEND to go to the canteen. - Yeah. But you end up in the laundry. The guards, they think that you are going to the canteen. - So I go to the canteen? - You go... to the laundry! - To the laundry? - Yes! Why I go to the laundry? - Because... The feeding, the food is in the canteen. This is bloody incredible! [SW] Listen, I said, you go to the laundry by mistake. To get the steak? - So, we eat before we escape? - What? No! - But we go to the canteen! - Goddamit, Herbert, listen. [SW] We go to the canteen every day, to eat. But you don't go into the canteen. You go into the laundry to steal two uniforms. I see! That's the plan? Yes, precisely. Allan we're in the canteen. The canteen! We made it! We made it Allan! After a year I gave up. [SW] I realized my plan was much too complicated for Herbert. Herbert, let's drop it. Forget it! Aw, shit! Where did I put it? Ach, scheisse! Was habe Ich damit gemacht? Dammit, Herbert, forget it. Please, try to get some sleep. - I cannot find that pin! - Pin, what pin? For what? - The pin for this! - That's a hand grenade. - When did you find this? - Ah maybe a year ago. - Come on. Where did you find it? - I found it in the laundry. - You've been to the laundry? - Yeah, I went there by mistake. You have to understand. You must throw it away. - Who goes there? - Halt! - Stop! [RU] Sorry, we have a problem. We have an unsafe hand grenade here. [RU] Throw it! Grenade! Now it's gone. I tell you, rockets were flying like cats' pricks in March: [SW] firing in every direction. - I think we should go now. - To the laundry? - Look. Here, we can take this. - This? We go? Fire is spreading across the military base. [RU] When Stalin heard that [SW] the Gulag and the whole damn Pacific Fleet had burnt to a crisp, he took the news very hard, and kicked the bucket. Shove him in the bathtub, flush the fucker, make him talk! Drag the bastard out of bed into the bathroom and douse him. [SW] - Dammit, pull yourself together! - Oww! - The address! Where does she live? Straighten up! - Ayi! - Where the fuck does she live? - Sjötorp (Lake cottage)... because it's nicely situated by a lake. Gäddan* did you hear? (Pike) Pedal to the metal, Hinken*move it! (Bucket) The amplifier doesn't work, I haven't had if long. The warranty is still valid. Sure, I'll bring it in. Thanks! I was thinking about those cadaver sniffing dogs. How do we know they always indicate cadavers? - How do you mean? It's a cadaver dog. - Well yeah, but... I dunno, I'm thinking... Allan is 100 years old, after all. - And so? - Well, older people smell different. A sweetish kind of smell. It's a little... A little "corpse-y." - Drop it? - Hm, I think so. Check these guys out: Per Gunnar (Gäddan) Gördin and Hans (Hinken) Claesson. I'm busy with the centenarian. It's the same bike gang: "Never again" - Didn't you read the whole report? - Yeah, sure, sure! Something caught in your throat? There you go! - What the hell?! - Have some vegetables too. I found this cell phone on the kitchen floor. - Is it yours? - No, it's not mine. It's not Gunilla's either. The thing's turned off. Well, turn it on, see who called and find out who it belongs to. Yeah, but can one do that? - There you go. - Thanks. Someone named 'Alleg', called. 'Alleg', again. Oleg? His name's Oleg, it's Russian. Little Popov called. - Is it your phone, Allan? - Yeah, it looks that way. - Yes, - Hey, I found the old geezer. Fucking great! You got the case, too? No, no case yet. There's a bunch of people here. - Just find that fucking case, quick! - Hm... ah, OK. "Hm, ah, OK"?! You got a problem? No, I'm just thinking about the fuckin' geezer. - What the hell do I do with him? - Don't think about it, just threaten him! Ok, I'll just threaten. This is a threat! Nobody move, or I'll blow your heads off, got that? The case! Get the suitcase! The case is in the room, the kitchen. Hey faggot, get the case, quick! - You mean me? - I said "faggot". Hurry up! Or, I'll shoot the old man. And you, there, keep still! Make it quick! Stop! Stay there! Back away from the case. Back up! - Hello! - Hello? What's the hold up? - Did you find the case? - I have it in my hand, now. - Great! Is the dough in it? - I'm checking it, now. You all take it easy! Nice 'n easy. Good, faggot, you stay calm. Nice and calm! - It's a crappy case, all plastic. - Shut up, you wrinkled old prune! - Goddamn, loads of cash! - Good Hinken! Get the case, the dough, and your ass over here, quick! - Get outta here, you bastard! - Stop bitch, I'll shoot you! - I'll do the shooting, I live here! - Stop, I said! Hinken, dammit, what's going on? Get lost, or I'll blow your head off! - Fuck! Shit! - Hinken? Shit! No... Caracas, goddamit! Get up. Hey, no screaming. - Where the hell have you been? - Buying melons. We were out. Hinken just got capped by that damned centenarian, and you, just, up and leave? - Are you joking? - Joking?! Does it look like I'm joking?! We lost half the fucking gang and 50 million and you're buying fruit! - Melon is not a fruit, it's a vegetable. - I don't give a flying fuck! That's not what it's about. Never question me like that, again. - You got that? - I won't. Where you going? Stop! Where the fuck are you going? You're not going anywhere! Stay here, goddamit! Shit! I'll cut this... There! - Did you get all the bullets out? - I think the last one went right through. Sorry, I should've done something before. - What you should've done, was, tell me about the goddamn stolen money. - Now I'm mixed up in this! - But it's not my money, yet. - They haven't decided if I'm in or out. - Yeah, Benny, you're in. Help me here! - So, he's in? - You too, Gunilla. You'll get some coin too. Coins?! I'm as deep in this mess as you lot. I'll take one fourth, thank you very much! - The sun's beating down. Wanna to go for a swim? - No! - Julius, shall we take a dip? - No, goddamit! - Sonja might want a bath. - No, she's not going to bathe. - What'll we do with him? - Maybe set the car on fire? Eh, let him lie there. Someone needs to do something about him! I guess that's me, since I'm the only one who takes any goddamn responsibility around here! Responsibility?! So your sense of responsibility is why we're so safe here, now? Hey, I wasn't waving a gun around, just now. What was I to do? He was gonna blow our heads off! Let's try to hurry, so we can get out of here. I'm going for a swim. Call me, on this, if there's anything. Where do we pick you up, after you set the car on fire? How am I supposed to know?! - OK. I'm driving a dead guy, around. I don't even know who he is! Well, you can never tell... People can look like they're one thing... and then turn out to be something else. In the spring of '68, in Paris... I went to a party with Herbert and his pretty little wife. It was at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. - Your Majesty, welcome! - Good evening. [FRE] - May I present my husband Herbert. - Enchante, enchante. - And his friend Allan Karlsson. - Welcome to our place. No, Jean-Claude, not now. Look... Ah, look, it's you. Are you hiding out? [SWE] - What are you doing here? - Sorry, have we met before? [RU] - You know each other? [ENG] - No no, he's confusing me with someone else. Jean-Claude Pistou, my interpreter at the embassy. No no, this is Vladimir Karpov. You better watch out for this guy, he's a real party animal. We had a big party with Stalin. Lots of vodka, we drank, Damn we had fun! - Who are you? [FRE] - Monsieur, you know very well who I am! Who are you? Vladimir had not only dressed up for the evening, [SW] he'd been masquerading, for years, at the Ministry. That made the French a little curious. Give us his name! [FR] And Ryan Hutton at the French CIA bureau... [SW] he became a little curious too. George, keep 4 o'clock open. So, how do you know this Vladimir? Well... Mr. Popov, he put us together. Popov? Yuri Popov, the physicist? Yeah, we had this party with... Stalin and Kirov and this KGB guy, Alexander. They danced like, you know... Cossack dance. I don't think men should dance, actually. But maybe if I get real drunk, I prefer a Snoa*. (Pivot-step) Or a Polska (walk-step). Polska is good. Real pleasant. Rather a Snoa. Snoa is good dance. It's quite quick. I get the picture, Allan. So, you know a lot of people and you're very sociable. - Hm, yeah. - So, are you willing to help us? Yeah sure, are you... are you in trouble? Thanks! [RU] - I'm looking for Popov. - Popov's over there. [RU] Old man's grip! [SWE] Have you started using the 'old man's grip'? What... Oh, my... look at you! What are you doing here? [RU] It's been such a long time. May I? American cowboy boots. - This is my son, Oleg. - Oh yeah, your boy? [RU] - Are they real American boots? - Yes, they're nice. - Can I have them? Please. - Oleg, quit it. - He can have my... - What's this nonsense! Take this, it's also American. No, you don't have to... - Now, Oleg, what do you say? - Thank you. Yeah, that's alright. Enjoy it in good health. So, my dear fellow, what brings you to Moscow? Well, CIA has a problem, so they asked me for help. I was thinking, you might be able to... OH, what the hell? [SWE] - Wash your hands. [RU] - I already have! Wash them again! My friend, I really would like to help you, but I cannot do that. I've got a family, now. W-why not? If I steal some secret information, they kill me and my family. Oh, hell, just talk to the people in Kremlin. The KGB must have something, lying there... that they wanna, you know, get rid of! I apologize my friend. Ryan Hutton, you say? [RU] So you're going through the CIA in Paris? - Yes, yes. Can you, at least, get some interesting information from them? That's pretty likely. Hutton was pleased with the crap the Russians sent. [SW] Now, how much money does this guy want? - No... no money, just... Just give him some of your information. Counter intel. That'll work really well, Allan. All of a sudden, [SW] I was a double-agent Spy. Well... spy? I don't know about that. There was nothing classified in that case. Both the Russkies and the Yanks dumped their trash straight into it. But, events were set in motion, anyway. Even a few targets liquidated, unfortunately. But then, that's what people do in cold wars. Where's yours? - They're in the back. - Oh! Oh, really?!... I say! - Gimme that case. Gimme, gimme! - Go! Go! People often appear to be one way, but then turn out to be completely different. America's new President Ronald Reagan, appeared to be a real SOB... Well... he turned out to be one, so maybe it doesn't always apply. It's the same button for the start and stop of the recording of sound. You toggle it. Toggle? English please. You tell him Allan, I can't stand all this technological doohickey stuff either. Why can't he use a normal tape recorder like anybody else? - Mr. President, Sir? - Yes? - A moment of your time? Start... and stop. - If we get rid of the wall, the roses will get more sun. - Oh, you're always bugging me about that wall! - The wall stays. - Yessir. Do you understand me, motherfucker? You're always bugging me about that wall! The wall stays. - Yessir. Do you understand me, motherfucker? I don't want any nasty critters invading my garden, I'm the fucking President! For the last time: Don't tear down that wall! This recording... [RU] confirms what I've always suspected. He's scared shitless at the thought that we'd tear down the wall. He knows that if we do... the Russian nation will invade the world... and take over, without weapons. When my old friend Popov died, [SW] I hung up my attache-case and shelved it, for good. But his boy would come visit me, sometimes. To tear down such a big wall with just hammers and chisels! [RU] It's a crying shame! - Here's to papa! - To your papa! That's incredible! With all the cannons in the East Block, and they just chip away at it, like that! [SW] What's this...? Hello? Did you stop answering the phone when you turned a hundred? [RU] Is that Oleg? You should always have the cell phone with you. - Well... - Never mind, sorry. Happy birthday. What are you up to? - I'm about to take an afternoon swim. - Afternoon swim? Cool, as usual. Did they have a party for you? What are you doing tonight? Apparently we're on the lam, here. Dunno how that came about! - On the lam?! - Yeah, some people died and now we're on the lam. For fuck's sake, Benny, move your ass! We must bail out! [SW] We need to pack food and clothes. - Did Julius call? - No, not yet. Ow! - Find anything? - Eh, what? - Regarding the centenarian. - No, no, no-no-no... We just learned that "Hinken" Claesson's brother lives nearby. He's called Ricky. Says he saw the centenarian at a place called Sjötorp. - Check it out. - Sure. I want my bag, here, in Bali, by tomorrow. B-but first I'm going to Sjötorp. I'm going there myself, understand? No assistants. I cut the ankle monitor. It's gone. Stop! Shut up! Just get BALI into your thick head. Understand? BALI. Otherwise you're gonna be food. I will serve you up as confit at your own fuckin' funeral dinner. Uh-huh... Food? I don't understand. What, why food? Nonono, you will BE the fuckin' food. - I... I am food? - You will be the food! Because we will have killed you, cooked you and fuckin' will serve you up! You fucking devil! [SW] Nonono, not you, I was almost hitting car in bus. Oh, Jesus Christ! Can't you even drive a fuckin' car? Wait, wait, I'll be back. - Is he Russian, then, Oleg? - Oleg, yeah, Oleg is Russian. - He travels all over the world. - Do you have any references for him? References? He's Popov's son. I've known him a long time. Hell, isn't it enough that he wants to help us? Maybe you'd rather call a PhD who's written a thesis on this: "Hunted by Fucking Murderous Bikers" for 180 college credits. Goddamn idiot is tailgating us. Goddamn narrow road! How fucking hard can it be? Lemme try, here... Fuck you! Bloody hell, look how he's driving! - What the hell's he doing? - Brake! What the hell?! Spun around like a carousel, and then, bloody, airborne. - Is that all? - Eh... a gas can. - With gas. - Do you have your own can? - No. - No? - And a lighter. - Yeah, one of those? Yeah, we're having a barbecue. Meat. I'm mad about grilling. - Now's the time of year for it. - Yeah, that's true. Eh, uh, w-wha...? What the fuck?! Goddammit to Hell! Doesn't seem too talkative. Pity, he looked so eager, before. Damn! - Is he alive, or what? - Yeah, but his head's bleeding. Hello! Hm! Ah... What the hell is this? - Get in quick, dammit! - What the hell's wrong with people? Swiping someone's car in broad daylight. They should be locked up! He'll get a helluva surprise when he opens the trunk. Got anything to make a compress? - Use a curtain, or something. - I can't, it's dirty. It must be clean. Who's that? Who's that? - He got run over. - But, who is he? - He was lying there bleeding. - Hello, can anyone say who he is? - He tried to shoot at us. - Shoot?! Yes, he did! When he wakes up he can have his damned case. Give away 50 million?! Are you stupid, or what? This'll never end. He's the second guy to shoot at us! It's not worth it. - Allan, they wanna give away our money. - It's not 'OUR' fucking money! - Which way, now? - Dunno. - Can you call that Oleg, now, Allan? I found blood, and I'm holding an empty gun cartridge. Fired, yeah! What? 'Course, I think, you need to send Forensic technicians. He's waking up, now. Here, take your damned case and leave us alone, now. What? The suitcase, you've been after all along. There, we won't call the police. Just go and leave us alone. My case? See, you chased us, then you passed us and... I think the three of us should have a little talk now. Just a moment. It's 'memoria damnum'. Amnesia. - Shit! - Plenty of that, at the rest home. - And bedsores. - How long does this 'damned memo' last? 'Memoria damnum'. It could last hours, or days. - Worst case? - Rest of his life, if he's unlucky. Let's leave him here along with his suitcase. Look, I'm not giving away 50 million to someone who doesn't even know it's his! That's where I draw the line! - Ah, hello? - Listen, never mind about the fuckin' hello! What exactly are you up to there, "Gäddan"? Do you know, who I am? If I know who you are? Yes I do! Do YOU know who I am? - No. Who are you? - Don't you fuckin' screw with me! You try and screw with me boy, d'you think for one second that I won't fuckin' screw with you? Upside, downside, sideways, up your fuckin' arsehole! Every fuckin' orifice! You think you're safe 'cause I can't go back to Europe? - Hello, it's Allan. [SW] - Who? This is Allan Karlsson. - Allan Karlsson? - Allan Karlsson from Malmköping. I'll tell you something mate, you and your fuckin' pals, you are fuckin' dead. You understand? If you want to kill me you better hurry because I'm a hundred years old. You my son, are dead fuckin' meat! Prick! Meat? He said I was meat. [SW] Who was it? He didn't say but... he very distinctly said, he was intent on killing people, left and right. - Kill?... Kill us? I'm gonna fuckin' kill'em, that's what I'm gonna do. Patsy, get out of that fuckin' water! Joe! Joe! Get on your fuckin' feet! There's some "jack the lad" called Allan Karlsson. We've gotta find out who he is. Get me online. Yeah, yeah... er... I know Orienteers are reliable people. But, don't you see... it's pointless. It's an idiotic tip. An old man and an elephant out in the woods?!... We'll dump the fucking guy, right now, suitcase and all! Pack up this shit! - I'm outta here, now! - Easy now, dammit, Gunilla! At first, it was all so important to share equally and show solidarity with someone else's money. But now, there's no need for consensus, anymore? What do you want, Benny? Do you feel like dying, here? Because, that's what'll happen! No, I don't want that. I want to live. What, the hell, kind of a question is that, to ask him? - Hello. - Hey, Allan! It's Oleg. [RU] - Oleg! - Listen, we'll be landing, soon. Where shall we fly to, then? We must radio ahead for permission to land. Can you hear me? Just a minute, Oleg. - Gäddan. - Huh? Where do you wanna go? [SW] We can go wherever, the hell, we want. - I dunno. Just say the first thing that pops into you head. B-Bali. - Bali? That's good. - Is that a place? Place?! It's an island, for chrissake! Oleg, yeah, Bali! Behind the slag heap? What? Sorry, but, I think that sounds a bit strange. Yeah, but, I have a right to an opinion. Yes, I'll check it out. Yeah, I'm on my way. - Yeah, hello. - You were right all along. These other leads had nothing to do with the centenarian. - What, then? - Andrän put out an international APB. They found both Bulten and Hinken. - Bulten is in Djibouti. - Djibouti, what's that? It's a little state in East Africa. Oh, how did he wind up there? Haven't the foggiest. Do they have DNA to confirm his identity? Not yet. The suicide bomber blew the whole square to smithereens. Uh-huh... And what happened to Hinken? They found him in Riga, squashed in a car crusher. Didn't you have a theory that he got shot in Sjötorp? - We found blood, there. - That was elephant blood. Elephant blood?... Hinken had no gunshot wounds, just wounds from the crusher. And according to forensics there was only elephant blood at Sjötorp. - And w-what's his name... - Gäddan. - where'd he go? We've got nothing linking him to the centenarian. His warrant is out of our jurisdiction. So, we've got nothing on anyone? No, nothing criminal, at all. This is incredible! I've got the centenarian in front of me right now. And an elephant! No kidding? Ask him if he needs a lift back to the nursing home. Not on your life... No! You can let it go, now. Ok, I'll drop it... I'll drop it. Rght, then... In spite of everything, I must say that you... you've done a damn fine job! See you on Monday. See you Monday. - Bye. - Bye. - Ayi! It's very tight. - It's supposed to be tight. - You're cutting off my circulation. - You do it, then. No, no, I want you to do it, even though you're doing a shitty job. [100 year old man missing] - Hello. - Oh you're still alive are you? - Well, where, the fuck, are ya? - Bali. Bali? Well, you really are taking the fuckin' piss outta me now aren't ya? - Eh? - What piss?... ...Hello? - It's Allan Karlsson! - Who? - It's Allan in the next car. Patsy, have a look on the left! Look it's Allan Karlsson with my bag. In the car on the left! I wonder why we humans are drawn to the sea. The sense of freedom I guess. Do something. Ram the car! Do something! What was that crash? Nice island -- Bali. Hello? Are you left on the phone? Ah, hell, yeah... Yeah... What the hell, you caught malaria, already? What? - You're white as a sheet. - No... Things are a bit messy, right now. I dunno... What the hell, man? She wants you! Yeah, I know. It's just that... ...it's getting serious, now. I need to make up my mind, sorta. I'll go and get us another one. - Not everyone is as fortunate. - What do you mean? I mean, having what you have. Few of us have that privilege. Go over to her and just say it. Should I say, it's the privilege of a few? Damn, you complicate everything! Go over to her. Yeah, I see what you mean... ...upon reflection, sorta... yeah. Hi.☻ Well, like I said, not everyone is that fortunate. You never know. Tomorrow's another day. What the hell did you tell him, Allan? Why is she yelling at you? Well, I've been yelled at by many people, in my life. Everyone from railway conductors to dictators. The first one to scream at me, was my mother. I don't remember her screaming, but surely, she must have. I probably screamed too. That's what newborns do, when they first look around. ♪Subs K. Svanholm corrected resynced by♪ XQ2☻♥
