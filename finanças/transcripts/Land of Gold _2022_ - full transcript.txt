(heart beats) (heart continues beating) (wind chimes tinkling) (gently chiming music) (heart beats) (upbeat music) - [Raveena] Thank you for coming on short notice. - I'll make these work. - It's so hard to arrange things on my putar's schedule, but thank God he's home for once. I'm sure Preeti will be stapling his feet to the floor. (group laughs) It feels like only yesterday I was chasing my children through this house. These walls are imbued with our memories. I wish Gurinder was here. When Kiran was born, Gurinder held him and said. (Raveena speaking in foreign language) It was Gurinder's greatest joy to be a father. And now, Kiran ji, you get to do the same. Preeti, Kiran. (Raveena speaking in foreign language) (group applauds) (upbeat music) - [Kiran] Hey, I thought you said this would be small. - [Raveena] It's only a handful. - [Speaker] Hey! - [Kiran] Mom, there are over 30 people here. - Be happy so many are here, you know Saroj Auntie? She had a party and only five people came. (Raveena speaking in foreign language) - Well, then why isn't Kuldip here? (Raveena speaking in foreign language) - You know why they're not here. Have some sympathy. We wouldn't have to rush this if you were here more often. - I'll be right over, one second. - [Raveena] Just like your father, always running off. - Do you even know what these ceremonies mean? We already had one shower. - Preeti's parents got to have their fun. (upbeat music continues) (singing in foreign language) Astrological signs, pundits. Don't I get to have my fun, too? I get to celebrate my grandchild, too. (Raveena speaking in foreign language) - Mom. - God, that white man is touching the garlands again. (upbeat music continues) (singing in foreign language) Excuse me. - [Sarah] She's gonna love it, Pree. - Yeah, it's not bad, huh? - And I love this little mobile. - Oh, that's Kiran's. I found it in one of his old baby boxes. I mean, his mom saved everything. (laughs) - Oh, you know what? I saw this, like, spacey blanket on Etsy. It'll be perfect. You can't decide? - Kiran's picking the paint. (overlapping chattering) (group laughs) (overlapping chattering) (Kiran sighs) (Kiran exhales) (Preeti clears throat) - Last one before the baby's here. - [Preeti] Your mom keeps talking to me in Punjabi. - I'm sorry. (Preeti laughs) - Apparently we have to get some sort of ceremony done tonight or the kid's gonna come out with bad knees or something. - Mm, the inauspicious bad knee disease. (Preeti laughs) (Kiran sighs) This whole day's been a nightmare. - Oh, come on, it's been nice. - You kidding? She went on and on about my dad. This is about the show, this isn't about us. - [Preeti] Okay, so do you want to come in, or? - Roger's got a job for me. - Yeah, I think you told him you were gonna stay home until the baby comes, right? - I leave tomorrow. - What? - [Kiran] I figured since the baby isn't due for a few weeks- - We agreed that you would stay home. - I know. - [Preeti] I scheduled an ultrasound for Tuesday. - Okay, I'll FaceTime in. - [Preeti] It was for you to come in person. (Kiran sighs) - Then cancel it. - I already said yes. - We need the money, okay? Bills keep stacking up, and- - Listen, we're gonna be fine, okay? I'm gonna go back to work soon and we've got plenty of savings. - Prakesh just got a truck with that self-driving software, and I keep losing bids on clients. I don't know how long I can keep this up. - Then get a loan and upgrade the truck, or buy a new one, or get- - I am not getting a loan. - [Preeti] Then sell it, go back to school, get your degree. - Look, it's just one last job until it comes. - It is not a concept, she is real. Seriously, what is going on with you, I just- - Look, what do you want me to do, huh? You're the one giving birth, not me. (Kiran sighs) Hey. (footsteps pattering) (Kiran sighs) (no audio) (alarm clock beeps) (no audio) (no audio) (car trunk slams) - If you still feel like this in a week, then I can't promise what you'll be coming home to.

(slow music continues) (slow music continues) (truck beeps) (slow music continues) - [Kiran] Hey, Roger, just got the load. I'll be in Boston by the fourth. My brother's out there so I might see him, but if you've got a load for the way home, let me know, I'm your guy.

(rustling drowns out speaker) (Kiran mumbles) No, no, I was just wondering if there's any workers that are missing. So no one's missing anyone? No, no, no, no reason. Yeah, yeah, no, the cargo is fine. Yeah. (water bottle crackles) (car horn beeps) (truck door creaks) (truck door slams) (birds chirping) You alone? Your family work at that distro? Speak English? Why are you on my truck? (Kiran sighs) If you won't talk to me. (truck door creaks) (truck door slams) (no audio) (truck door creaks) (truck door slams) - I need you to take me to Boston. - Oh, she speaks. - I promise I won't be any trouble. - I am not running a charity. - Let me go then, I'll find another way. - The police will take care of you. (Elena cries) - [Elena] Please. (speaking in foreign language), please! - I can't help you. - Hey! You need something, boy? (siren wails) You deaf, speak English? (Elena cries) Do you need something? - Uh, just looking for a bathroom. - Check the diner down the road. (police radio mumbles) (traffic faintly rumbles) (no audio) - What's your name? Hey. What's your name? - Elena. - I'm Kiran. (no audio) (seat creaks) (truck engine rumbles) - [Preeti] Hi, you've reached Preeti Rao. I can't come to the phone right now so please leave a message after the beep. (phone beeps) (traffic roars) (traffic continues roaring) (traffic continues roaring) - [Phone] We're sorry, the number you have dialed has been disconnected or is no longer in service. Please check the number and try your call again. We're sorry, the number you have dialed has been disconnected or is no longer in service. Please check the number and try your call again.

What is it? - Food. - [Elena] What kind? - Indian food. - Maybe there's something else- - Hey, just roll it up like a burrito, okay? - You know burritos aren't even Mexican, right? (Kiran sighs) (slow music continues) - So your family's in Boston? - [Elena] Sort of. - Sort of? - Just my uncle. - [Kiran] Aren't you Mexican? - Mexican American, why? - I didn't think Mexicans lived in Boston. - Well, my uncle does. - You know his phone's not working, right? - He's lived there for years, okay? - Okay, okay. (slow music continues) (singing in foreign language) So why are you headed to him? Hey, did your family smuggle you across the border or something? - We live in Boyle Heights. In LA. - Where are your parents, then? Look, I need you to tell me if your family did something. Otherwise, I can't help you. - No one did anything. I don't need your help. (Kiran sighs) - Wait. Hey, wait! (sign buzzes) - Hey, kid! No loitering, paying customers only, dinero. (Elena speaking in foreign language) (Elena dramatically sighs) - [Sandra] Border jumpers, we get them, like, three or four times a month looking for a free night. They try to sneak in, I call the cops, clear them out. (laughs) I ain't running no damn charity, just you? - Yeah, just me. (room key rattles) (door creaks) (backpack jingles) (Kiran sighs) It's all they had. (Elena sighs) Look, I'll be right back. Don't let any strangers in.

Yeah, right. Sorry, are you okay? - I'm fine, I just thought something happened. - Yeah, is Mom bothering you? - She's fine, won't let me cook in my own house. - Oi, oi, this house used to be mine. When you can spice your own sabzi, you can cook all you want. (speaking in foreign language) This is the good part. (Preeti scoffs) - God, your mom is a trip. So why did you call me 20 times? (water trickles) (water splashes) (water continues splashing) (water continues splashing) - [Kiran] I couldn't just leave her out there. - What if the police pull you over? - That won't happen. - [Preeti] It's happened before. - Then I'll just explain the situation. - Think about this for one second. They're gonna think that you kidnapped her. - You're being ridiculous. - I don't want to visit you in prison. - She doesn't have anyone else. - But you're putting our family at risk. - Well, this girl is real, she isn't a concept. - Fuck you, Kiran. (phone beeps) (Kiran sighs) (Elena hums) (Elena continues humming) (door rattles) - [Kiran] Elena? - What? - [Kiran] Can we talk? - [Elena] I don't know, can we? - I got you something. I thought you might want some clean clothes. (Elena sighs) (door creaks) (door slams) (lock rattles) (bag rustles) (bag continues rustling) - [Elena] These are all ugly. - It's all they had. (Elena sighs) You know, I used to run away a lot. I used to run away to my best friend's house and steal all of her fruit snacks. Her mom would always scream, "Where did all the fruit snacks go?" I'd run home and throw up rainbow. (laughs) (Elena sighs) - I didn't run away. - Okay. Where are your parents? - I don't know. (Elena sighs) (door creaks) Why didn't you turn me into the police? - They won't help you. (traffic roars) (traffic continues roaring) (traffic continues roaring) (traffic continues roaring) Clean up after yourself, you do what you're told. This is my truck, my business, understood? Understood? - Understood. - Let's go. (traffic roars) (traffic continues roaring) (truck rumbles) (truck continues rumbling) - Can I push it? - Push what? - The horn. - No. - Come on, just once? - No. - Please? Come on.

(Kiran laughs) - You know a lot about Boston. - Papi does. Is that your dad? - Mm-hmm. - [Elena] What's that thing on his head? - A turban. - [Elena] It's like a hat. - Sort of, it's a special hat, Sikhs wear it. - Your mom's hair is pretty. - Yeah, she's never cut it. - Ever? - To this day. - What's a Sikh? - A person who follows the Sikh religion. - I thought Muslims wore turbans. - Some do, ours are different. - Why don't you wear one? - You ask a lot of questions. - Are you a Sikh? - [Kiran] Yeah. No, no, not really. - What? - Huh? - What were you just thinking? - I was thinking you should stop drinking so many sodas. - Lying is a sin. (no audio) - My dad cut my hair when I was your age.

I completely forgot she was with me in a robbery. (laughs) It happens, you say, you're Indian, right? - Yeah. - You mind clearing something up for me? Chicken tikka, tikka masala, I love them both. What's the difference? (traffic roars) - Do you realize how irresponsible that was? We're lucky he was an idiot, otherwise I would be in cuffs and you'd be God knows where.

(Preeti laughs) He's a bonehead. - The bone-iest. - The truck's cool, though, the horn's awesome, and he's got a telescope. - [Preeti] He let you see it? - No. - Well, that's Kiran, keeps everything to himself. (birds chirping) What's your uncle's name? - Diego. - [Preeti] Can I see him? - Mm-hmm. - Do your parents know you're on your way to him? Do your friends know where you are? - I didn't want them to get in trouble. - Is Kiran feeding you okay? - Indian food is tasty, it's like our food. He told me to roll it up like a burrito. - Why don't you hand me back to him? Smells like cigarettes? - I stopped, I swear. Can you see what you can dig up on her? - She's really sweet. I'll let you know what I find on her family. - Thank you. (birds chirping) - [Elena] She's mad at you. (Kiran sighs) - I know. - What'd you do? - I decided to help a stowaway. - It's definitely something else. - She's pregnant. - Hormones. - What? - When Mommy was pregnant with Matty, she was so weird. We had to be extra nice to her. - Hmm. (Kiran sighs) - What are these for? - [Kiran] Where'd you get those? - [Elena] In your bag. (Kiran sighs) - Put them back. (traffic roars) (Kiran sighs) I'm supposed to pick a color for the nursery. - I can help, I'm great with colors. Papi lets me dress him 'cause I'm so good with colors. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, (laughs) Uncle Diego builds houses. I'm sure he's great with paint, I'll get him to help, too. (Kiran laughs) - Great. - [Elena] This one. - Hmm, you know what I would love? - What? - [Kiran] If you would go back and take a nap. (Elena sighs dramatically) (slow music) (Kiran sighs) (slow music continues) What are you listening to? (slow guitar music) - Selena. - Old school. - She's my mom's favorite. (slow guitar music continues) (slow guitar music continues) Have you ever been to India? - No. My dad used to say it looked like this, farmland as far as the eye could see. Have you been back to Mexico? - [Elena] No. Mommy always says we can't go 'til we know we can come back safely. - This is what I'm telling you. This is not her, how are we going to find her family from looking at this one? - I'm just trying to find out where they're taking them. - Arms out, go back up. Hands to the center, bend your front leg. Yeah, then go back up. (grunts) Oh, yeah, that's a good stretch. Hey, Mom, what's up? - [Raveena] Hi, beta, have you called your brother? - [Kiran] No. - [Raveena] Kiran, how many times do you go to Boston? You should see him. (Kiran sighs) - [Kiran] Yeah, I'll think about it. - [Raveena] How is Elena? - She is fine, she's sleeping. (Raveena speaking in foreign language) - You're doing the right thing with her. Hello? - Uh, hey. - [Raveena] The phone must have cut. - No, no, no, I'm here. (Raveena speaking in foreign language) (Raveena continues speaking in foreign language) (Kiran clears throat) - How's Preeti? (Raveena speaking in foreign language) - Did you ask her if she wanted help? - Arey, you should be here helping. She's taking her stress out on me. I'll have you know I was a saint when I was pregnant. - Mom, I've told you a thousand times to stop micromanaging her, she hates it. - Well, if you were here, I wouldn't need to be doing all this. Maybe get her something nice as an apology, nah? (Raveena speaking in foreign language) - Really don't need relationship advice from you, okay? - When you were getting married, I told you that you should treat your partner as equal, not as a third person. - Yeah, so? - You're not making up for what your father lacked. - Do not compare me to him. - If you think we did such wrong, why repeat it? (traffic roars) (traffic continues roaring) (quiet overlapping chattering) - [Elena] Why do we always have to eat Indian food? - [Kiran] Healthier than burgers. - [Elena] I like burgers. - Hmm, so do I.

Stupid. - [Kiran] Elena. - I hate waking up early, but on Sundays, it's okay because I sing in the choir. Matty wears a suit (laughs) and he's cute. I love singing with everyone. When you hear the songs, you just know everything's gonna be okay. It's just (sighs) not the same here. (no audio) - Hey. Come with me. (slow music) - [Elena] What is that? - [Kiran] I don't know, a Sikh hymn. - [Elena] It's pretty. (Kiran speaking in foreign language) - Hello, goodbye, God is the truth. Here, take your shoes off. Wash your hands. - [Elena] What is this place? - It's a gurdwara, a Sikh temple. - [Elena] Why are we here? - [Kiran] Well, you said you liked the music. (slow music continues) - Do Sikhs believe in Jesus? - No, just God. - [Elena] But Jesus is God. - Not for everyone. Here. Cover your head in there out of respect for God. - [Elena] Like the turban? - [Kiran] Exactly, like a turban. (Elena laughs) (slow music continues) (singing in foreign language) - You need one.

(door jingles) - Get off of me. - What were you doing in there? - You were taking forever. - Is this how you act with your parents? - I just wanted a candy bar, what's your problem? - I told you to wait in the truck. - It's not a biggie. - Did you see the way they looked at us, at you? - No. - You don't know what's out there. You don't see what I see. The rules are different for people like us. I can't protect you if you don't listen to me. Now, get back in the truck or find a new ride. - No wonder your wife hates you. I don't need you to protect me, you're not my dad. Just because your life sucks doesn't mean mine will, too. - You're right. I'm not your dad. And you sure as hell aren't my daughter. (footsteps pattering) What! (cigarette wrapper crackles) - [Gurinder] It's my (indistinct), this is my house. - [Officer] Put your hands behind your back. - I live here, Officer. (siren wails) This is my house. (Raveena cries out) - [Raveena] Gurinder! - Don't do this in front of my wife and child. (Raveena cries) I didn't do anything, why? What did I do?

(backpack rustles) (telescope box rattles) - I got something to show you. You coming? - I can't see anything. - Close your eyes. Open. You see that one in the middle? That's Vega in the Lyra constellation. It's my favorite. I went to school to be an astronomer. - [Elena] Nerd. (Kiran laughs) - Oh, hey, look at this. Ah, look, look right here. That's the Little Dipper. You know what star is at the end of the handle? Polaris, the North Star. - [Elena] It's not as bright. - Mm-hmm, but if you ever get lost, just find that star and you'll know exactly where you are. (no audio) When I used to run away, I'd look up and escape into the stars, imagine all the possibilities that were out there. I don't know if I believe in God, but when I look at all this, I know that there's something else out there. That's God to me, the infinite. - [Elena] Why did you run away? - My dad, he wasn't home a lot, but when he was, he drank a lot, yelled a lot. - Why aren't you an astronomer? - Dad got sick. There were bills to pay, a brother to go to college. I had to step up. - When Matty was born, I had to help take care of him. Diapers are the worst. - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you. - It's okay, Mommy and Papi get angry, too. (no audio) - What happened to them? - There was a raid at my apartment. And no one knew what was going on. I don't know where they are. (traffic faintly rumbles) I think you should become an astronomer. (Kiran laughs) - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm, it's what you wanted. I want to become a singer, make lots of money so I can take care of my family. - Does your family like your songs? - Papi's not home a lot. When he is, he records me and sends videos of me singing to tia and abuela in Mexico. - You any good? (Elena laughs) - I don't know. (Kiran laughs) (slow music) (traffic faintly rumbles) - [Kiran] If you had a truck, you would have a yellow one, right? - [Elena] No, pink, no, purple. Would you have a tan one? - [Kiran] A tan one? - [Elena] You always wear tan. - What are you talking about, I always wear tan? A small fry, apple slices, grape soda, a double cheeseburger with a small fry. - Every Sunday after church, Papi would always say, "Next year, mi mariposa, we're gonna live by the sea." Mommy would always say, "Diego made it. He's got two bathrooms." (laughs) Papi's still jealous Tio got there first. He loves Boston. - Why? - He said he wants to live where America started and drink all the freedom tea. I don't really get that part. (laughs) - The American dream. - I want to see him. I miss him. (slow music continues) Why are you mad at Don Kiran? - I just wish he was home. (slow music continues) - How about. - What? - A nice reddish pinkish? - Hmm. - I'm a genius, look at this neon yellow. - Neon yellow? - Yeah. - I thought you said you were good with colors.

Saved me from being grounded for my whole life, whether it was that shot glass, college, whenever the shit went down, you took care of me. - Kuldip, this is different. Like, this isn't the same, okay? You shouldn't be the one to have to take care of him. - You're about to have a daughter, let it go.

When I was your age, I saw a photo of a sheep, a sheep on a big hill, green grass, beautiful wind blowing, and it was my dream to find that. I came to America looking for it, but never found it. But you know what? I found something much better. (slow music continues) I found my family. (slow music continues) (slow music continues) And you know, this whole world, whole universe is yours, and he will give it to you. (slow music continues) (truck rumbles) (truck continues rumbling) (wind whistles) (birds chirping) (no audio) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (Elena sighs) (Elena knocks) (door rattles) - [Michelle] No, I gotta call you back, yeah. Hi, can I help you? - Is, I'm looking for Diego Hernandez. - I don't know anybody named Diego, sorry. - Is this not your address? - Yeah. Yeah, that's it. - He should be here. - The previous owner had a tenant. I don't know where he went, I just bought the spot. Can I get you something, sweetheart? You want a glass of water or some soda? - No, thank you. - [Michelle] Hey, I'm real sorry I couldn't help you more. (bird chirps) (door creaks) (footsteps pattering) (birds chirping) - Could Diego be anywhere else? Did your parents give you anyone else you can call? - I wish they could have. - Hey, tell me what happened. - Papi and I got into a huge fight. Zashia invited me to a concert. He kept saying no, he was always so scared something will happen. I was so mad, I needed to get away for a bit. I ignored all of their calls, and when I came back, Immigration was there. (slow orchestral music) And I saw, I saw Matty and Papi and Mommy in the back of a truck, and then before I knew it, they were driving away. - Look, that was not your fault. You did not do that to them. - It felt like I did. - Your family doesn't blame you. - What if they do? - Elena. - Get off of me, you're just a stupid old man. (slow orchestral music continues) - Hey, hey, hey, hey, punch here, punch here. Again. Harder. Again. Again, again, again. Punch, punch, again. Again, come on, get it out, come on. Come on, come on, come on. (Elena cries) (slow orchestral music continues) (Elena continues crying) (slow orchestral music continues) It's okay. (seagull cries) - My family had a plan. Papi worked at the center, said trucks came from all over the country. If things were to go wrong, it's Diego. He's family, and he'll take care of you. - Why my truck? - You reminded me of Papi. (seagulls crying) I told him I hated him. - [Kiran] You didn't mean it. - But what if he- - Hey. He loves you. No matter what. - I don't want that to be the last thing I said to him. - What do you want? - I want my family. (Elena sniffs) - We'll call every detention center, lawyers, senators. I will do everything I can to find them. (seagulls crying) Give me your photo. (Elena sniffs) (pen scratches) (ocean waves faintly crashing) (seagull cries) You're family now. (Elena sniffs) (seagull cries) (ocean waves crashing) (phone vibrates) (phone continues vibrating) - Hey. - [Kiran] You always had my back, even when it was just fruit snacks. - I still do. (traffic roars) - I'm scared, Preeti. I don't want to become my dad. - You won't. - We're not gonna make the same mistakes, okay? We're gonna protect her, support her. - We'll show her every day that we love her. - I, uh, I picked a color. Its, it's not one of the swatches, but, oh, I sent you a message. - Okay. (no audio) Lavender, huh? - Yeah, it felt, it felt right. - Well, your mom's totally gonna think this is auspicious. (Kiran laughs) (Preeti sighs) How's her uncle? - He wasn't there. - She's strong.

(slow piano music continues) The universe is constantly expanding. Stars form, galaxies die. None of it is good or bad, it just is. Things just happen, and the only choice you have is how to respond.
