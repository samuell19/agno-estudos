Linh San speaking! Yes, tell me quickly. Move it to tomorrow. Okay! Call the garage, tell them I'll be there at one o'clock. Don't you have anything else to say? Eat me up! Meow! I like it! Meow! Catch me! Catch me! You missed it! Catch me again! Meow! Meow! You missed it again! Catch me! Catch me baby! No! My banana! I'm Linh San. I just turned 30 last Saturday. I'm single and I have no intention of getting married. Don't be so surprised. There are 1001 reasons for a beautiful, successful woman to say no to marriage. For me, the only reason is simply because I'm perfectly fine living my life without a man by my side. I'm the Creative Director of Belle, the top fashion magazine. I am considered as the Power Lady of Vietnam fashion, I can say that my life is perfect. And I don't want to change anything about it. Do you think I should get a chin job? I think hair removal is a better idea. No! That would make me look so gay! Girl, please keep in mind that me, Oliver, is a closeted gay man! The most closeted in the world! Yeah, you hide it so well... What's that attitude? Stop it! Do you know that my precious hand can slap you in the face so hard and quick that all your teeth fall out? I dare you! Dare? Boss! Where? Good morning, boss! Gosh! You have crossed eyes, don't you! How could I know if you talk to me? Sis! Wait for me! Sis! Slow down, sis! Wait for me, please! Coffee for you, sis. As usual, iced latte, no sugar. Okay, thank you! Sis, that handsome director sent you flowers again. Should we place them on your desk? Nope, you can keep them. Hi, how's everything? Well, that's cool! - I'll keep these and think of him for you! - What about the layout? What? Stop! Stop everything! I told you that concept can't be used for the cover. Give me another option, now! Sis, don't forget to visit our editor-in-chief's granny in the hospital at two o'clock, okay? But we have a beauty shoot for our next issue at two o'clock, right? What are you saying? The shoot is at 2 p.m. tomorrow! Where's your super memory, my powerful lady? Is it? Okay, I got it. Why you haven't sent me your ten pages of fashion articles? I got it, I got it! Nope, you always forgot it. Hello, Miss? Excuse me, miss? Excuse me? Call Nam for me. I'm in a rush! Miss, because you moved back an hour so Mr. Nam's still working on another car. No, I mean... How about I find another staff member for you? Fine. Quick, please. Of course. This way, please. What? He was here just now... Where is he? Thien Minh, Thien Minh! Thien Minh! Where are you? We have a customer waiting! Thien Minh! Please wait for us, just a little more! Thien Minh! You have a customer waiting! - What are you doing? Pervert! - What's that? Let go of me! - Ah! Let me out! - Let go of me! Miss, we are so sorry! We believe that it was just a little tiny incident. Apologize! Sorry madam! What? Madam? Yes, maybe Auntie? Ah! I've got customers coming! Please work with Thien Minh! See you then! Ah, can I see your car warranty booklet? Oh! They say fine wine ages well... Here. Here it is! Please check the fuel meter, and fuel cap. They got problems! And the trunk as well. It often gets stuck. Phan Thi Linh San. Born Feb. 2, 1986 in Ho Chi Minh City. Address... Where did you get it? It was in the booklet! Hey you look older than in the ID photo. Did you hear what I said about the car? Check the fuel meter, fuel cap, trunk. That's all! What else, madam? That's enough! I only have 30 minutes. Do it quickly! That is not enough! Now you only have 25 minutes left. Okay? Okay, madam! I'll have everything checked! Fuel meter, fuel cap, trunk! 25 minutes? Not even enough time to cook a chicken! Here's what you asked for, Head Doctor! Where is the egg? Where is the test result? How many times do I have to repeat myself? I'm sorry, Head Doctor. I'll go get everything. Here is the health record of a new patient who were just in last night for artificial insemination, Head Doctor! Oh my egg! This case is very very simple. The problem is his sperm. Bring him to me. I can help him have a baby in a flash! But what if you cannot? Too tall for your own good! That layout is not good! Definitely not! I told you! They don't like short models! It's so impolite of you to speak so loudly in a hospital! Email me! Excuse me, Doctor? Are you Linh San? Yes? Don't you remember me? It's me, Trang Dai! Elegant Trang Dai! Remember? I was vice monitor of our class 12A3! Ah! Trang Dai? Exactly. Dai the shorty? Go get me the results! - Yes! - Yes! It's hard to recognize me, right? I'm prettier and taller! You can't recognize me, right? I've changed a lot. Everybody says so. It's hard to recognize you, too. Such an ugly dress you're wearing! You look older than your age! I know you were ugly back then, but now you're even worse! I'm making a bad joke, right? I don't just make bad jokes, but... the worst ones! It was the same when we were in school. Where are you going? I'm visiting my boss' granny. Granny's still able to give birth? Hard to tell, right? Come to my office for a drink! I'm sorry! I'm in a hurry! A little late doesn't kill. Come with me for a drink! I can't! I'm heading to a meeting now. Really? So you're the famous Obstetric Head Doctor Trang Dai? Yeah, that is me! I'm super famous. I have a lot of trophies and certificates. Many newspapers want to interview me but I'm too busy to talk to them. Do you know who's the director of this hospital? It's my husband! I've got two kids, one boy and one girl. How many kids do you have? I'm still single. Single? Oh my egg! Over 30 years old but still single, you're screwed! You're already 30 but... Oops, bad joke... Give me your blood! What are you doing? Sorry, I'm always too enthusiastic when it comes to work. I just want a bit of your blood for my research! What research? Oh, I'm researching about ovary syndromes in single women over 30 years old! Ovary syndromes? In other words, premature menopause! But, I'm scared of giving blood. Really? Falling for you I can't get you out of my mind And through the long nights I've been reminiscing the past Linh San! You're so sick! Go see a doctor, please. Why are you always bothering me like this? Linh San, can we start over again? God! Please, go home. Don't come here to annoy me anymore, okay? And, stop sending me flowers every morning as well! You don't even know that I hate roses. How can I love you? You don't like roses? Then which flower do you like? Lilies? Hibiscus? Just tell me. I'll buy for you tomorrow. Linh San! You don't get it or you just want to drive me insane? Linh San! I truly love you. We had a really good time together, didn't we? Let go of me! Please go home! You're truly hopeless! Anyway, you're the director of a big company! Don't do such crazy things like this anymore! - I gotta go! - Linh San! Linh San! Linh San! Linh San! Really, that same old shit? - Don't be a party pooper, sis! - He's right. By the way, what took you so long outside? We waited for hours. I stood waiting so long my legs dislocated! Is it bad? How do you walk? I got them fixed! Good for you! - What's up? - What's wrong? It's Vuong making a fool of himself again! So that was him! I thought the neighbors opened a karaoke! Then why don't you return his feelings? Are you nuts? What do you think? The only things out of his mouth is marriage... and baby. Gosh! Oliver, look at Linh San! Young, beautiful, and talented. She's in her prime. Why getting married too soon? Right? Just have fun. If Vuong insists, he can fuck off. Let me tell you. We are young. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Just go with the flow. Hey sis, if you're not interested, pass him to us. We promise to take care of him very well! From A to Z! That's right! Pass him to us, please! Boom boom boom boom, I want him in my room... It must be him again! Wait! Leave him to me! Leave him to us. Remember what we said? From A to Z! Okay, do whatever you want. I need to shower and change now. Hot guy alert. Boom boom boom boom, I want him in my room... Oliver! Lady first! - I saw it. - Is that him? Who's that... Is this... Linh San's house? It is. And Auntie, you are... I'm Trang Dai, Head of Obstetrics at the International Hospital, Linh San's high school classmate. Classmate? I came here because I have an announcement! Are you crazy? Open the gate! Yes, sure. Ovarian insufficiency? Right. Even when I received these test results, I couldn't believe my own eyes. Does it cause death? No, dear! But Linh San will soon suffer from menopause symptoms... horribly! Are you serious? Horrible menopause symptoms at the age of 30? That's right! And what's even more important and serious is that... she may not be able to conceive anymore. Don't you believe me? Take a look! The VSATTP index of your blood is unpredictably high. Even your lutropin and estradiol level in your blood are 20 times higher than usual. I have tested many times, again and again, back and forth... but the result remained unchanged. So you're 100% sure about it? No! I have never ever said 100%! It's only 99%! Tomorrow come back to the hospital. Let me do the DNA test one more time. Then I can give you an exact conclusion! Uhm! Actually now I realize I've always had all the symptoms you mentioned. For the past two months, my periods have been irregular, they even disappeared! My skin also shows signs of aging. It's definitely menopause! She's absent-minded as well... Menopause it is! That makes sense! She's been so forgetful these days! That is no doubt menopause! Let's go clubbing! Let's party hard, guys! Leave all your sorrow behind! Right! Let's go! Your life is a mess anyway, let's set the world on fire tonight! - Girls on fire! - Go go go! No no no! Back away! I don't really like crowded places... This place is so freaking crowded! So many people! So much fun! Hey, control yourself! That guy is looking at me! Keep cool. I'm going to the toilet. Wait, let's make a toast first! One, two, three, cheers! Oh my god! So crowded! So crazy in here! Gosh, look at her! Let's drink! Wait for me! Let's go wild! The old villa is so spacious and convenient. Why do we have to move here? This place is way too far! I got it... Can you give me a hand? Nope! I have no hand! Bring the TV in for me! No! Bring my plants first! His TV later. This is the DNA test result I just took. Please check it for me. What is it about? Am I really sick? I have an announcement. I think you'd better start treatment as soon as possible. If I get treatment, can I be fully cured? At the moment it can't be cured completely. But we can treat some of the symptoms. I think you should get married and have a baby as soon as possible! Before you lose the ability to give birth! Oops I did it again! Sorry... So, how much time do I have? Linh San... Maximum six months! Six months? Half year... I still have a chance. I still have a chance. May, Oliver, wake up! Wake up! This is Linh San's plan... Life indeed is always full of surprises. From this moment, the book of my life has turned to a new chapter, full of stories which could only happen in Korean 90's movies and I have no choice but to rewrite it, in my own way. See! Very simple right? Let's go girls! - Cute, right? - You call that cute? - He's cute! - No, he's not. - This one is cuter for sure! - Guys, stop it! Is this one cool? He's my type! Is he nice? No way! What do you think? Look at his style! - I think he's okay. - No, guys. It's a no! - You choose again! Please, you do it. - Guys, look... Look! He's even got his sunnies on. What do you think? Thank you so much. You've always been so thoughtful. Hi dear! Oh you came. This is Huy, my friend. And this is Linh San, my very close friend. Nice to meet you! Me too! So, you two are... This is... my boyfriend. Do you like it, Auntie? Is it beautiful? Yeah... It is pretty, dear. How about this side? Am I better, Auntie? - Yeah, better! - Yeah! Ice creams coming! Here you are. - Thanks Dad! - Over there, kids. Let Dad have a chat with Auntie. I'm so sorry! My wife is away, so I have to tag them along. It's all right! Your kids are so cute! Just like me! I have to say, it's so hard to find the right man for you, Linh San! Or is it because all the perfect guys are extinct? I think you're right. From my great deal of experience, men in their 30's who are handsome, rich, and successful yet single? They are all gay, sis! Or, maybe, they are... - weirdos, psychos, freaks... - That's right! Those are the forever single types! My oh my... Perhaps it's true that they are all extinct... Not all of them. I'm here, sis. This man shall always be by your side, sis! Go to hell! Let me tell you something. Men, in our standard must be the whole package, not half a man! Got it? Sis! She offends me! Hey! We're brainstorming. Where are you going? I'm gonna some water to calm down. To soothe the man inside of me! There's a man inside of him? Half a man? Sorry sis, but you're so wrong! S.O.S! Hot guy alert, girls! Tall, six pack, pretty boy! Are you done yet? Almost, Uncle! Here, have some water! Thanks Uncle. - Uncle! - Oh my God! My pajamas got wet! I just wore it yesterday! Sorry, Uncle! Take them off, I'll go wash them. - Let's go! - No! Let go of me! I told you I'm not going! Trust me, I've already bang all hot guys in this neighborhood! Really? Sorry, I mean... I already know every hot guy in this area... That's why you need to see this guy! Come here! Prepare yourself! One, two, three! So hot, right! So sexy, right! Where? Where's his six pack? Right there! Six pack from head to toes! I can only see a skeleton! Have you changed your taste? What the abs? Hey, I want bananas, not dried grapes, okay? He's been alone for too long now he's become desperate. Poor boy! These are ribs, not abs! Damn! I really need to have my eyes checked. Hey, the guy's calling! Director Vuong? Cheesy! - Boring! - Cut! - Hang up! - Hang up! Linh San! Will you marry me? I will write love poems For you my love I will build our castle Linh San. Hi there... Hi! - Babe! - Ah. Let me introduce you Linh San, Creative Director of Belle magazine. We're working with them for advertising. And this is hot girl Kha Han, my fiance! Hi sis! Linh San. It's nothing to worry about. There are plenty of fish out there. I'm sure there must be one right for you! Am I right? Am I? The problem is time. You know I don't have much time left! Come one, you have six months left, sis! Six freaking months till your eggs expire! The egg doctor's coming! Again? I have an announcement! Why are you always showing up with some announcements? Oh my egg! Why are you talking about me like that? If I show up, it means there must be something extremely important and extremely urgent. Why I said so? Everyone knows I'm busy. Countless eggs and sperms are waiting for me to work on. My magical touch can turn them into babies. I'm not free to come here for nothing! Wow! The Egg Queen! How powerful you are! Powerful Egg Queen what? She's Disaster Queen! Do you know it is scientifically proven that poor communication can link with ovaries disorder? You should have your ovaries checked! But I don't have ovaries? Then go check whatever you have! Go! You're right! Get him checked! He's got two balls! Please help incubate them into a baby. Shut up! Normal girls don't laugh inappropriately like you. They don't show off that much skin as well. You should take a test as well! There must be something stuck! So stuck that your boobs swollen! Go have a check-up! But how can you tell that I'm sick? Because I'm a top expert in this field. I see. So you come here today just to ask them to take a test? Oh no no! These two confused me! Sit down, please. Of course I have something more important. I'll make it quick, precise, easy to understand, and based on science. That is... I have an announcement. - Again! - Gosh! Announcement, announcement! What really is the announcement? Wanna be sterilized? Linh San, the previous test result said that you have six months left, right? There is a little mistake! I knew it! It sounds so wrong from the beginning! See? I told you guys! Our Linh San couldn't suffer such stupid disease! What's its name again? Ah... Well... Something really nonsense! Ovaries, egg or banana something! I'm sick just to hear its stupid name! Exactly! It's her eggs, not fruits. They can't just ripe whenever they want! Now that she's fine, let's celebrate! - Let's have fun! - Let's go clubbing! Sit down! Wanna be sterilized? Linh San, I told you that you have six months left, right? But it's not true. Not six months. You have... Nine months? One year? One and a half? Two years? Two months! All I can say is... I'm so sorry for your loss! I think tonight... we should go clubbing! Let's drink and dance for fun! Let's party hard! Two months or two days make no difference! Just ignore it and... Sorry! I'm acting stupid again, aren't I? Fine... Let's go clubbing. Gosh! Wanna be sterilized? Hey cheer up! We're going to the club, not to a funeral! You too! It's a party, not a death anniversary! Let's have some fun! There's nothing to be sad about! Let's party! Party! Damn, I keep telling her to use pins to hang clothes! Please be yourself of yesterday Woo woo woo Please be yourself of yesterday Of yesterday Woo woo woo woo Which one, which color Which underwear I wore yesterday Woo woo woo woo - Help me! - Damn it! Calm down, I'm here! Calm down! Don't worry! Who are you? How can you get in my house? Well... I... I live next door! I saw you so... I come to help! - Stop it! - Why? Don't come here! Stay away from me. - Don't look! - But how can I leave you like this? Calm down! Ah! It's you, madam! Madam who? Gosh, I'm falling! Help! - What? - Help me! Madam, don't you remember me? How can you forget so fast? I'm screwed! May, help me! Oliver! Help! Help me please! Help! Gosh! Wanna be sterilized? May! Oliver! May, do you hear it? Yes, that's Linh San's voice. - Linh San! Something wrong! - Go help her! Bring a weapon! Grab something! - Linh San! - Are you okay Linh San? Wait for me! Let go of your hands, I can catch you off from below. Close your eyes! My dress is falling down... Calm down. I'll count to ten, you let go. I'll catch you. Nothing's gonna happen. - Close your eyes first! - How can I catch you with eyes closed? One! Two! Ten! - Linh San! Linh San! - Sis! sis! Banana! Banana! Banana... Rape! Rape! Rape! Run! Run! He's coming! Let me go! Get off me! Pervert! Rapist! Why? Thien Minh... Doctor... Trang Dai? Nope, I'm not Doctor Trang Dai. Crazy! Who's Trang Dai? It's not me! Not me! I'm not Doctor Trang Dai. Are you Doctor Trang Dai? No! - Doctor Trang Dai? - Not me! This is funny! It feels like wherever I go, I bring trouble with me! It sounds bad, but so much fun! Isn't it? How do you know that pervert mechanic? - How come you call him pervert! - Right, how do you know him? He can't be pervert! He's too hot to be a pervert. Unlike you. If you do something bad, I will never forgive! I asked you how do you know him? He went to my hospital to donate his sperms! Why do you have these two crazy dogs at home? Oh my God! Why don't you give me his sperm? Don't waste it! To be qualified for donation, his sperms must be high quality! You are so bad... And I like it! How do you know his sperm is good? Yeah right! Well... This golden hand of mine directly tested his sperm quality. How can I say... It is... - Excellent? - Excellent? Are you dogs? Here's a bone! Eat it! Hey! I have an idea! Hang on! What's the rush? Good morning Uncle. What's up? We come here today to set up the satellite disk for you! Yes, that is right! Please stand still, Uncle. Keep holding it in that direction to catch strong signal, okay? Now I'm going upstairs to check the signal. Only when I say "done", you can let go. Is that okay? How is it going? Have you found any clue? Look! There must be dirty secrets inside. Open it! No way, why are there only his childhood photos? Look. He's been handsome since he was little! How lovely! There isn't any photo of girls. Maybe... He's never had a girlfriend? Oh my god. Perhaps he is gay? What if there are photos of his boyfriend? Stop stop stop! You want it so bad, don't you! Keep looking! Look! His passport! Tran Vu Thien Minh, 28 June 1985. So, he's just one year older than Linh San. Yes! He's five years older than me! Gosh, it's half a decade! A perfect number! Perfect match! Hey, stop dreaming! He's not for you. Have you done yet? Gosh! I need to pee... Quick! Put everything back! Hurry up! I can't stand anymore! Damn it! Where is he? Target acquired! There he is! What's next step? Camouflage! Put on the mask! Hey, where is he now? - Hey! Over there! - Follow him! These holes are tiny, I can't see anything. Shh! Be quiet, hurry up! Quick! Follow him. Ouch, my feet hurt... Dang! Why the hell are you wearing high heels? What now? What should we do now? It hurts! Help! Help me... I cannot swim! I cannot swim! I cannot swim! He jogs every morning. He jogs to the pool. Then he jumps in, and swims away. Doing the dog paddling... Then he goes to the garage... Fixing cars! After that, he goes to the yoga center to teach... Stop! Rewind! Rewind! - Go to the garage... fixing cars. - Fixing car. There! Stop right there! He's a car mechanic. What does that have to do with yoga? Because he's also an yoga instructor, sis! Yoga instructor? Yes. Why are you so surprised? Working at the garage doesn't earn him much so he takes on a side job. That's right! These days it's not unusual for someone to have many jobs at once. Go on! After teaching at the yoga center, he... That's enough! Let's register for a yoga course! Girls, wild pig coming! Go away, the two of you. Let me approach him alone. How come? - The more the merrier, sis! - Go! Hey! Beat it! I don't need any wing men. Go! Shame on her! Selfish! Smitten! Hey! Madam next door! Madam, you haven't compensated me for what you did to me yet. Well, about that... I... I'm sorry, big brother! Big brother? You're my instructor from now on anyway. It's better to call you like that. OK! It's all right! Just don't regret it. Why would I do that? Being my little sister is not easy. You think that's funny? Funny to you! Three, two, one! Shazam! Hi ma... Hi... there! Hi! What a coincidence! You like jogging too? Jog with me! Okay. Here! I got your result. I'll be giving you estrogens and other hormonal supplements. The result seems to be very positive. No worry! Just stick with me. We'll make the best out of Thien Minh's tadpoles! Oops! Mind my language. Have a look at the result. This is the ultrasound scan of your ovaries, and ovulation calculator chart. Hey you're reading it upside down... Forget it. Let me show you. These days are the best for fertilization. Let me circle them for you. Do you get it? Remember, you only have two months left. Or, two more ovulations. It's once a month. Therefore... on these days, you and Thien Minh... must get on it! Would once be enough? Once during these days is okay, I guess. But the more, the better! Now I feel relieved. As long as I can get pregnant and give birth in a natural way... No worry! I'll always be by your ovaries' side! Hello, Uncle! I'm looking for Thien... What are you seeing him for? I have something for him... Just give it to me! I'll give it to him later when he's back. Well, please give it to him then. Are you done? Why don't you leave? Well... Good bye, Uncle! Girls, I think we are so done! It's been thirty minutes! Why's he not calling? I told you. Just write "Call me" in Vietnamese. So much English! "Call me if you can"! He's just a mechanic. I bet he hardly knows a word of English! He can always ask Mr. Google! It translates everything, sis! You shut up! Calm your tits! No man could ever escape from my love traps! Well said. But I've been swimming for hours, has he called you back? Well... he might be busy! Working at a garage, playing with bolts and screws, what's to be busy about? - Unknown number! Unknown number! - Let me see it. Eleven digits. This is no fancy number. It must be him! - Come on! Just give it to me! - Take it. Hello! Linh San speaking! It's me! Handsome Thien Minh! It's him! It's him! Thanks for the luxurious gift. You didn't have to do that! So I was thinking... Can I take you out for dinner tonight? - Yes! - Yes! Where are you? I can't hear you. - Hello? Can you hear me? - Hello? Hello? I'm having a meeting at the office. - The signal is a bit weak. - Hi, hello... - What did you just say? - How are you? I'm fine, thank you and you? Oh, I was just saying... Can I take you out for dinner tonight? You don't have to do that... What? Don't be silly! - Hush! - You're out of your mind! Go with him! Let me check my schedule first... Hold on! - Just pretending! - What a tease! Girls must act like we don't care when we really do. If you are busy, don't bother... - Go go go! Say yes to him! - I'm available! I rearranged my schedule. Gosh, that was close! Okay! See you tonight at seven then. Okay. See you tonight. Bye bye. - He's got trapped! - See? - My sis is brilliant! - Let's... Congratulations! One! Two! Three! Yeah! Two! Three! Ah! Hey! You two! You look... stunning! Men will fall all over you! Me as well! You as well? I'm feeling the man inside me is coming out! Stop! You must be joking. Listen, you must knock him out right on your first date. You must eat him raw like tuna sashimi! Yum yum yum! Would it be too fast? Moreover, my ovulation is not today. Oh, really? Never mind then. You're really a piece of work. Well, it doesn't matter. I wish you a romantic night with candles, wine and a serenade in an upscale restaurant! And next to your Prince Charming, Mr. Mechanic! Consider it done. Have some of this. Thanks. I've been to this shop since I was a kid. I eat here almost every day. Bill for that table, please. Here you go! - Thanks, Auntie Chin. - Mmm. Wow... She's a beaut. - Minh, you're such a womanizer! - Shh! He took so many girls here. There was a blonde, then a redhead, then someone with green hair. And now you with a bun! - Auntie Chin! - What? So this is your routine for dating girls? Nope. She's just joking. She's very funny. - Auntie Chin! - What? She's misunderstood me now. Help me explain! You want me to tell her all or what? No! I quit. Never mind. She's just joking, don't take it seriously! Eat up. Do you want more chili? Don't worry! The noodles here are clean and delicious. I've never had any stomachaches. Eat up. By the way, why do you take these empty tins back? Ah, I'll make some toys for my kids! What? You have kids? Yep! I have many kids. So... you... you're already married? Not yet! I'm still happily single! What do you mean then? So that's my story. I have adopted some kids from the orphanage. You know, I always come to visit them at least once a week. I see... Then, what these tins got to do with your kids? I'm going to make some toys from them and gift to my kids. Well, I should go. Good night! Have a good night! Linh San! Wake up, wake up, hurry! What's up? Wake up! Wake up! But today is Saturday! I know! But your ovulation period... Oh my god! I almost forget! Oh my god! Come on! We have to get me prepared quickly! Call Oliver! How to trick him into sleeping with me? What to do now? Bitch! What time is it? Wake up now! Bring you lazy ass here! Linh San ovulated already! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday to you! My dear Oliver! Thank you so much, sister! Make a wish! Oliver's going to have a wish. I'm making a wish now, guys. - I wish... - Oh what a meaningful wish! - Quick, blow it off! Blow it off! - Right, do it. - Done! - Done. Everything's finished! - Sit down! Sit down! - Yes, yes, yes! Sit down, Minh! Don't be shy! Now let's make a toast to celebrate Oliver's birthday! Two! Three! Go to the supermarket... to buy a four-tail rooster, an eight-peak bird, a three-horn buffalo, - then buy... - Buy what? - Say it! Quick! - Hang on, don't push me... Don't tell him! You'll get punished too! I'm thinking! Ah! Buy a tranny cock... Yeah! Tranny what? You? Gosh, buy a brown cock, baby! You lose! Sit down! Quickly! Hey, it's only us drinking! - We have to get him drunk! - Drink up! - Thien Minh! Thien Minh! - Thien Minh! Thien Minh! Go to the supermarket to buy newspaper, a tank top! Buy? Buy? Buy? You lost! Drink it! Drink, drink, drink it! Hang on! Buy white shoes. - Is that right? - Continue... Buy what next? - Calm down! Buy... - What? What? What? Lose! Drink it! Wait! Buy a cassette tape! Is it right? Buy a cassette tape, buy a seven-color parakeet! Next, Linh San! - Quick! Five! Four! Three! Two! - Go to the supermarket to buy... - Buy what? Say it quickly! - Buy... Buy... a tank top newspaper! You're wrong! Are you crazy? What's a tank top newspaper? That's right. There's no such thing! Drink up! Drink up! Then tell me, buy what next? What is next? That's easy! Listen! Go to the supermarket to buy newspaper, a tank top, white shoes, a cassette tape, a seven-color parakeet... Yeah! Drink up! Drink up! Drink! Drink! Drink! Quick! Quick! Quick! Drink it! Drink it up! Drink it up! Let's go to supermarket... Wake up wake up... This wine is nothing. Wake up, guys! It's all because of Oliver! He was so dumb to suggest that drinking game! Are you any better than me? You lost all the time! You drank the most! He should have given you the whole bottle to drink! Sis! Wild pig calling! Wild pig calling! - Wild pig? - Yes! Sit down, guys! Sit down! Hello? I just want to save money. That's why I asked to borrow your car. How dare you take advantage of me? I don't! Actually, I've thought about it a lot. How about I take you to the noodle shop to thank you? Okay! You haven't told me where we're going. You'll know when we get there! SUNFLOWER ORPHANAGE - Kids, remember how to play this game? - Yes, we do. Hello? Keep it close to your ear. - Mi, can you hear me? - Yes! I see. - How are you doing? - I'm fine. - Are you doing well at school? - I am! - Try speaking up. - Hello hello? You only have two months left. Two months to have a baby, or never! Take it! Do you like it? - Now, let's do this. - What are you doing, Mi? I'm playing over here! Why so sad? Nope! I am happy. It's been a while since I had such a peaceful time. The kids are so cute! They are cute but also pitiful. I can't understand why some people can abandon their children like that! I don't understand them either. Many people out there dream of a child but can't have one. Come play with me! Play with my daughter. Hello? Can you hear me? Wow! I can hear her so well! My dad said you are really beautiful. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me well? Come play with me, Auntie. You are so pretty! Thank you! Join us, Minh! Dad, come play with us! Here I come! Tell me! Did you guys do anything last night? Nothing! We visited the orphanage, then had dinner before coming back home. Are you crazy? Why did you miss such a good chance? You should have grabbed him then eaten him up alive! Don't worry. There's still plenty of time! - But... - I gotta go to work! Hey! Linh San! Plenty of time? Hell no! If you can't bed him, gather all your eggs and make an omelette instead! Talking about eggs makes me crave bananas! Put on lipstick first, then I'll go have a banana. DID YOU JUST USE GOOGLE TRANSLATE? HOW DO YOU KNOW? HA HA! Hello hello? Can you hear me? Yes, I do hear you! Surprised? I just made it. You are amazing, aren't you? Is it because you don't want to spend money on calling me? Well... Yes, I'm saving. I'm saving money for my kids. Do you want to... give me a hand? Give you a hand? Yes. The kids like you a lot. They even want to call you... Mommy. Is that true? Of course. Would you give me a lift tomorrow? Why are you so stingy? Because I have to save money to raise my kids. And save money to buy ice cream for you as well. How long will I have to give you a ride for? Not too long. Until we die. Do you agree? So what do I get in return? Where will you take me to? I'll take you to the moon. We will open a noodle shop there... - How about that? - You want to see the goddess of the Moon? Why are you up so early? Come on, look! You only have two days left. If you don't speed up, the first phase would be over! Everything is on track! He's falling for me now. He asked me out again tonight. Out to eat what? Eat him instead! Why are you so anxious? Because I'm worried about you! You have to speed up! No worry, I got it. Remember to squeeze him until his last drop! Only two days left, got it? Got it! Don't you have to save money for your kids? Why are you taking me to this luxury restaurant? Don't worry! I've kept the money to raise my kids at a safe place. Now I need to spend money to find them a mommy. Raise your glass! Let's celebrate. Today is my pay day... and our two-week anniversary. Is there anything else? Yes, there is. Today marks the 19th time we met but also the first time not at the noodle shop! You have a good memory. All right, cheers! All the best! Would you like to dance with me? Can you dance? We'll see. Can you? My lady, shall we? We are home. You go first. You first. Ah, I have something for you. Where did you get it? From the restaurant. Thank you. You should go inside. Okay, I'll go then. - Good night! - Good night! - Linh San! - Yes? I... I... I just want to say... Let's go jogging tomorrow. Yes, okay. Have a sweet dream. Just three words. Why can't I tell her? It's weekend. Why are you home tonight? I'm waiting for you. Is there anything wrong? Tell me the truth. Are you in love with that wild pig? No, what are you talking about? What makes you think that? We eat, we sleep, we seduce men together. Do you think you can lie to me? Are you drunk? Go to bed please! Since when did you like roses? I'll go upstairs to take a bath now. It's been a long day, I'm too tired to talk now. Stay there! I'm not finished yet. Linh San! Is it because you've fallen for him so you don't want to trick him to bed? Because that means your relationship will come to an end. Am I right? Linh San! How about... we are officially dating from tomorrow? Well, this is not right. I'm not polite enough. Let me do it again. Linh San. I know that you've been into me for a while already.. No! She'd slap me for sure! Are you in love with him? Are you? It's not fun anymore. Are you going to hide this forever? Do you think I'm stupid? Look! Your ovulation calculator chart! Today is the last day. Do you even care anymore? What is on your mind? What are you afraid of? Are you scared of losing the baby or are you scared of losing him? Tell me! Okay! Enough! You want the truth? Let me tell you. Men are lining up for me. There is no reason for me to fall in love with a mechanic! Do you think my taste is poor? You are my best friend. Don't you know me? Let me tell you one last time: I only approached him for his seeds. I will leave him at soon as I have what I need from him. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. He's just a wild pig. But at the moment, I... Thien Minh! Thien Minh! Thien Minh! Listen to me! Thien Minh. Please listen to me! Stop! Let me explain to you... Thien Minh! Hello? Thien Minh! Hello? Thien Minh? Thien Minh, please say something to me. Thien Minh! Hello? Hello? CALLING WILD PIG The number that you're trying to reach is not available at the moment. - Mi. - Yes? Has your dad come here lately? Yes, he has. When did he come? He came last Saturday. Dad always bring us a lot of toys every time he comes here. But last time, he brought nothing. He just sat there in silence for a very long time. So... Did he say anything about me? I kept asking him about you... but he didn't reply. Really? Before he left, he told me that... he will be away for a long time. He won't be able to see me then. Do you know where he's going? I... I don't know. FOR SALE Are you going to work? Yes. Are you selling your house? Well, yes. In the past, whenever he broke up with a girl, he always asked me to throw away everything related to his ex. But this time, he keeps holding on to this little tin with a heavy heart. At night he puts it back in the box. You see... Memories... They're only meaningful to someone who is not ready to give up. Thien Minh... On the outside, he looks rough and reckless. But on the inside, he's very emotional. I've lived with him since he was a kid. I know him well. Although he didn't talk much, I know for sure he's still obsessed about that incident. That incident? What is it about? It's about his mother. When he was 12, he caught his mother having an affair with the family's driver. Mom! Where are you going? Mom! Don't leave me! Mom! Don't go! Don't go! Hurry up, baby! We have to leave before his father comes back! Don't leave me! Mom! Don't go! Mom! You know, after all these years, Mom! He's still obsessed about the day his mom pushed him away to get in a car with another man. Later when he'd grown up, whenever he dated someone, he'd always break up with them just after a few months, rather than building a long-term relationship. He doesn't want to be like his father. He's afraid of being cheated on. I don't know what really happened between you and him. But I know you have hurt him very deeply. - Linh San! - Sis! Thanks God! You're awake! - Linh San! - Sis! Look at me! Do you remember me? Oliver! - Me? How about me? - May! - Thanks God! She hasn't lost her mind! - I'm so happy for her! What happened to me? Where am I? In the hospital! You had a car accident. You were unconscious for three days. But you're okay now. - How do you feel? - Is she okay? She's fine. Did I have a surgery? I'm sorry, Linh San. I have tried my best... but I can't... I can't keep your ovaries. What did you just say? What happened with my ovaries? You said I have one more month to get pregnant, right? I have one month left, right? No! Calm down. Calm down. You must be calm. The accident has damaged your ovaries seriously. We have no choice but to cut them off... You cut them off? What do you mean? Does it mean... I will never be able to have a baby? Not anymore? But why? Why? - Sis, you're making me scared! - Tell me why? Sis, let's go inside! Let me give you a cleanse. - This side too. - Bad stuff go away! Come on, jump over it to get rid of bad luck. Jump! Jump! Get inside! Have a rest! Yeah right! Jump jump! - Jump over the fire! - Two, three! Go go go! Let me jump! Linh San! Are you there? Hello? I'm here. I'm listening! Thien Minh! Is that you? Yes, it's me. I'm... sorry! No! I'm the one who must apologize. I wasn't honest with you. I tried to take advantage of you... I've hurt you a lot. But... You don't have to explain. I know everything. Dr. Trang Dai has told me everything. There's only one month left for Linh San to get pregnant. That's why she and her friends were trying to get your sperm. Was that your only purpose when you approached me? Am I just... a wild pig? Thien Minh! It's you. Thien Minh, I'm sorry. Yes, it was my purpose in the beginning. But I couldn't do it. Stepping into your world, seeing you smile everyday, seeing you happy with the kids. It made me feel guilty. Now I guess... God eventually punished me. I completely have lost my chance to be a mother. Linh San. I will never ever be a mother. Linh San! Linh San! Don't say that! Calm down and listen to me. Linh San. You will be the most beautiful mom for our kids! Mom! Mom? Dad! Linh San. Will you be Mi's mom? I... Linh San. May Lord bless this couple with love and approval. For the commitment and promises they have expressed. May you always be blessed with contentment and prosperity. What God joins together, let no one put asunder. Amen. Oh my god! Am I late? By the way, I have an announcement! Is that my test result? - Am I in menopause? - Oliver! Oliver!
