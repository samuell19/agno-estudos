[mellow guitar riff playing] [frantic music playing] [distant screaming] No, Dad, no. -[Ami screams] -Hey! -You killed Mom! -It wasn't my fault! -You killed Mom! -You know what? [Ami screaming] [suspenseful music playing] -[thudding] -[Ami screaming] [distorted screaming] [Ami grunts] [grunts] [eerie whispering] Ami? [metal clangs, grunts] ["Redline" by Affinity Falls playing] ♪ Just have to let go ♪ [Jennifer] Okay. Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, and Chucky. [Aaron] Oh, come on. Okay, marry Freddy, kill Jason, and that leaves fuck Chucky? Yeah, fuck Chucky. [Jennifer laughs] [Aaron] Well, you go then. [Jennifer] Marry Jason, kill Jason, fuck Jason. In that order. [Bert] Both of y'all are dead to me. [bottle creaks open] [Cory] Bert, I swear, dude, if you spill again, I'm coming back there and I'm gonna strangle you myself. [suspenseful music playing] [Bert] Don't tickle me! [Cory] Oh, God. -[groaning] -[Aaron] My lady. Aw, you're so sweet. -[smooching] -[Aaron] That's me. [sighing] Uh. So, where should we go first? Oh, I wonder if that one burger place is open. -Uh, what's it called? -Henry's. Dude, that place had the best shakes. [Jennifer] Good one. That sounds like a plan, but I think first we should grab a few things before heading out to the cabin. [Jennifer] Yeah, that's smart. [Aaron] Meet back here in 30 minutes? -Sounds good. -Okay. Let's go, boy. Uh, sure, let's go. So what? You just want us wait here? [laughs] Come on, Leyla, let's go look around and see what's still here after all these years. Well, I don't know about you ladies, but I have to change my shirt because certain somebodies can't keep it in their pants. Okay, Bert. Yeah, just come find us when you're done, okay? Hey, Leyla, this taco's for you. -Oh, fuck you, Bert. -[Bert growls] Bert! All right, you know what? -Why don't you stay by the car? -[Leyla] Oh, yeah. [Bert] Yeah, it's good to be back. Fuck, man. Why did you drag me into this? I don't wanna go shopping with you. Cory, I know you hate shopping, bro. Look, we've grown close over the years as brothers. You look at me as, like, your blood brother, right? After what we've been through? Like, yeah, you're more than a step brother. Why are you being weird? Oh, fuck. Is that what I think it is? Sure is, bro. -It's long overdue. -Yeah, you think? And I need my best man to help me. [Annie] All right, is this going to be all for you today? -[customer] That's it. -[Annie] All right, just $5. [register dings] All right. Y'all have a great day. Enjoy that. -Tell everyone I said hi. -[customer] Will do. [whispered murmuring] Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in. Oh, my God. Is that you, Annie? [chuckles] You still fucking work here. Hey, watch your mouth. My daughter's right here. -[Leyla] Okay. -[scoffs] Oh, my God. How are you two? I haven't seen y'all-- what, since high school graduation? How have you been, Annie? Um, I'm okay. Mommy, who are they? Don't point, baby. It's not polite. Do you remember all those pictures I showed you of me in my high school uniform? Well, these two... ladies, were on the same team as me. -This is Jennifer and Leyla. -Hi. Leyla was the one I told you about. Who stole my high school boyfriend and my homecoming queen title. [Leyla sighs] Oh, my God. Still haven't let that one go, hey? Oh, come off it, Leyla. You got everything so easy in high school. You got off scot-free with everything. You know you stole Cory from me. The two of you were pure evil. And you, you just let it happen. Annie, come on. That was forever ago. We were just kids. Look, Leyla's a different person now. She's grown up. So have I. I work as a social worker with addicts at an Austin hospital and Leyla's a registered nurse there. -Yeah. -[Leyla] Yeah. I help people now, Annie. That's more than you can say for yourself. Yeah, super mature, Leyla. So what? You two are big city girl, career girls now? Is that what's going on? You forgot where you came from? [scoffs] Beats sitting around the same dusty old shop 15 years later with no future. You will probably die at that counter one day. -Leyla. -No, it's okay, Jen. Let's let the has-been talk. Same old story. She peaked in high school. We know she's never gonna amount to anything. -I've amounted plenty. -Yeah. [laughs] You know what? You break it, you buy it. -[Leyla] Hey. -[Annie] You got it? Is that little Annie Eastman? Oh, dude! Oh, shit. Oh, for fuck's sake. Bert, you clumsy oaf. [Leyla] You will have to buy it, since you probably broke it. Isn't that right, Annie? [scoffs] $1,000? For this? You've got to be joking. It's never been opened. You clearly damaged it. It's just a little scratch. Maybe I could un-scratch it. No! No. Pay up first. I'm sorry. I only have $200. I don't have 1,000. For God's sake, Bert. Don't apologize to her. That's probably how she makes all her money out of this dustbin. Scams putting unsuspecting travelers out of their money. No one would actually buy anything from this dump. What? [Annie] You know what, Bert? $200 actually sounds pretty good. -[Leyla laughs] -I'm serious. $200. You can take the damn thing with you. It gives me the creeps anyway. But you said it's one of a kind, and I wouldn't even know what to do with it. [Annie] Well, you know, it's fine, it's just-- Annie, be smart, girl. It's okay, Papa. I got this. I got this, it's fine. Seriously, Bert, $200 is fine. We'll be right as rain. [sighs deeply] Again, I'm really sorry. Thanks for letting me off for only 200. So, uh, Annie, you have any newcomers around here? Or is it just as quiet as when we were kids? Not too long ago, a family bought the old Cutter farm. But they didn't last very long. They left pretty quickly after they realized the land wasn't worth anything and they couldn't grow anything on it. That creepy piece of land? Isn't it haunted by some curse? It was tainted by a bunch of Satan worshipers. People still see the carvings in the trees. No, the Cutters were a bunch of idiots who couldn't take care of their land. Now look at it. Cows can't even graze on it. Well, if that's everything, now feel free to get the fuck out of my shop. Nothing would make me happier. -Oh, I'm sure, honey. -What? Are you going to the reunion, Annie? That's why we're all back. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Okay. [tense music playing] [door clicks open] -[Bert sighs] -Well, what's in it? -I don't know. -Open it up! It's never been opened before. Well, then fuckin' open it, bud. Open up. [Cory] Come on, big money. Oh, this is rubbish! [all laughing] 200 bucks for a fucking bear? Way to go. What a waste of money. I'll tell you what a waste of money is, that new wave medicine that nobody wants. [Leyla grunts] Fuck you, inbreed. Cory, hey, rude. Apologize to Bert right now. [Bert] No, it's okay, Jen. That's the best that Cory can come up with since he's basically special needs anyway. Isn't that right, Gory Cory? I told you not to fucking call me that. -Hey, enough. Enough. -Hey, hey. -Come on, guys. -Stop. Enough. Come on. Calm down. We came here to have a good time, and that's what we're going to do. -This is too much drama for me. -[Bert laughs] That's calling the kettle black, Leyla. [sighs] Sure, Aaron. I'll chill. [Leyla] Let's go. But you better watch those comments of yours, Cory. Come on, bro. All right? [Bert] Hey, you're going too fast. [Aaron] Hey, backseat driver, zip it. -[police siren wails] -[Aaron] Oh, fuck. [Cory] Way to fucking go, bro. [door shuts closed] Hey, Gibson. Go around the back. 10-4. [knocking] [Aaron] I got this, guys. Yes, Officer? Uh, I'm not an officer. I'm a sheriff. -Oh, my bad. -There's a big difference. Anyway, you have any idea how fast you were going? Uh, no, sir. -Was I speeding? -Oh, yeah. We're 25 'round here, we clocked you at about 53. [exhales] Yeah, you were going kind of fast there, pal. Uh, you might hit somebody, hurt somebody. Gimme your driver's license and registration. And IDs from everybody in this car. We didn't do anything wrong. Why have you stopped us? I didn't ask you anything so you shouldn't talk to me. Okay. -There you go, Sheriff. -All right. I got it. Fucking prick. Hey, long time no see, Leyla. [Leyla] Hi, Danny. How are you? -[Danny] I'm doing good. -[Aaron] Long time, man. [Danny] Yeah, how y'all doing? Y'all in town for the reunion, I assume? Okay, listen, I'll let you go with a warning this time, all right? -Okay. -[Leyla] Thank you, Sheriff. Sure, sure, sure. Just slow down next time, would you? [Aaron] Yes, sir. My bad. You guys have a good afternoon, all right? All right, you too, Sheriff. [Bert] Thank you, Your Honor. [melancholic music playing] [door clicks open] -[Jennifer] Here we go. -[Aaron] Okay, let's see. [Leyla] Welcome to my humble house! -[Bert] God. -[Jennifer] Go, Bert. I'm carrying a lot of shit, guys, come on. [sighing] [Leyla] Unbelievable. Those motherfuckers were supposed to remodel this entire house before we got here. -Leyla. -[Leyla] What? -It's fine. -You're kidding me, right? It's-- it's got some-- it's got some character. -[Jennifer laughs] -Yeah, Leyla. It's a-- it's a really manly man's place. Real butch. Hoorah. Fuck off, okay? So that means it's time to go back to Austin, right, guys? You're not helping. Okay? I'm kidding, Leyla. It's fine! -[Leyla] It's a mess. -[Jennifer] The place is fine. It's only for a couple of days. [Leyla] Sure. [laughs] -Leyla. -What? It's a nice place. Come on, sweetheart. Yeah, just-- just go ahead. Let's go find our room. [Leyla] Just go ahead. So, uh... where's our room? [Leyla] Back off, Cory. Back off, okay? It's ladies only. Well, hey, Bert, you're invited, then. [laughing] Hey, uh, Leyla. Where do you want your shit? Just leave it there, okay? I'm not in the mood right now. Thank you. You're welcome, your Majesty. [Cory] Oh, hey. [mouthing] Fuck you. [eerie tones and sounds] [eerie tone intensifies] [Leyla gasps] [man sighs] Come on. Any luck, Bert? Not much today, but I'm-- I'm still hopeful. Damn. So, Aaron, it's been a while, man. When are you gonna finally propose? [sighs] It's all in the timing, my guy. Besides, I'm not gonna drop any hints with the biggest gossip since high school around. Do you really think I don't have the self-control -to hide it from Jennifer? -[Aaron] No. Well, you did tell us about Cory's penis. -What? -[Cory] What'd you say? I did not! Tell him you're lying. She said it was cute. Similar to how a sorority girl reacts to a Chihuahua. -[Leyla laughs] -Fucking end you, bud. Oh, good one, Gory Cory. Hey, come on, guys. Damn, can't y'all get along just for one weekend? And after that, you don't have to see each other ever again. Just calm down. Okay, boys. Let Aaron have his practice kissing the bride. -[Aaron] Leyla. -What? I'm not proposing. Not yet, Johnson. And you, sir, messed up my tan. Let's go. Give them space. It's still funny. [police radio chatter] [engine revs] [siren wailing] [grunts] Oh, Jesus. [car door alert beeps] You all right? Are you gonna help a lady up? [grunts] Certainly. Come here. There you go. Well, thank you. What are you doing honking at somebody jogging down the road? Well, I'm sorry, 'cause, uh... I wasn't trying to scare you. -Really? -Yeah, really. I just-- I recognized you. I haven't seen you in a while. Yeah, it's been a minute. It's been a very long minute. So what do you want? -I wanna make sure you're okay. -I'm fine. I'm running between two fields in the daylight. Yeah, well... crazy things can happen in the daylight. That's true. Um, listen, you know, if you're... I could turn them lights on... and give you a mobile escort, wherever you're going. I'm pretty sure I know the way home. Yeah, I guess you do. If you're hurt when you fell down, I'll put you in and give you a ride. Well, luckily for me, I'm perfectly good. -[Sheriff] Yeah? -Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can see that. Well, you know what? You know where I'm at. -Yeah, I do. -Sheriff. I see that. Maybe one day you'll stop by and... chase each other around the room again. Not tonight. I guess that means maybe tomorrow is a possibility? See you later, honey. [discordant music playing] So, how do you feel about being back home? It's fine, I guess. [sighs] I don't know, Aaron. I just-- coming back to Junction brings back good memories, but I never liked it here. I just feel like I shouldn't be here. Babe, that's normal. I mean, I feel weird about this place, too. It's strange, after all these years, it's still the same. I was always anxious in Junction. My anxiety came back as soon as we got here. Come on, babe. Let's go enjoy the sunshine. Uh, no. I'd burn so fast, I'd look like Freddy Krueger. And? I like me some Freddy Krueger. I'd still love you. [scoffs] In fact, I still remember that one year where you had that godawful acne. Wow. [chuckles] You know, you always say the sweetest things to me. Gross. [romantic music playing] Babe, I have a question to ask you. I've been thinking a lot about us lately. How time is fleeting... and spending time with the people you love is what life is all about. I know we've had our shares of ups and downs. But we've always managed to continue to love each other... be there for each other. When I look into those beautiful green eyes... and that smile of yours... I just think... You're the most beautiful, amazing woman I've ever seen. And how I'm the luckiest man in the world. You're my best friend. I love you. You'll always be my best friend. Jennifer Anne Corolla. Will you marry me? Yes. Oh, my God, Aaron, yes. [both laughing] [music continues] [smooching] [eerie melody playing] A deer and, like, a rabbit once-- What are you talking about? [Cory] And even the math teacher back in high school. Rubbish! Rubbish! Hey, hey, there she is! It's Aaron Johnson. -What's your name? -Shut up. -[all cheering] -My new sister-in-law! -Show me the ring. -[Cory] Yeah. -Look at that thing! -That's beautiful. Hey, I want a picture, I want a picture. -Picture. -Oh, wait. Um... I'm just gonna go freshen up really quick. -I'll be right back. -Okay. -All right. Cheers. -Why does she hate me? [door creaks open] [sighs] [clears throat] [soft sigh] Mrs. Jennifer Johnson. Mrs. Jennifer Corolla-Johnson. [screams and gasps] What the fuck? [Aaron knocking on door] Hey, babe, you okay in there? Oh, yeah-- yeah, baby. I, uh, knocked a shampoo bottle off the shelf. [Aaron] Okay. Gotta make sure my fiancée is okay. I'm going back to the party. I'll be right out, baby. [suspenseful music playing] [clears throat] -[ominous whispering] -[dramatic chord plays] Hey, buddy. You need a tan? All right. ♪ Dan the Tan ♪ ♪ Tanning the whole family for less ♪ Morning. Come on down to Dan the Tan, where I'm killing the competition. -[grunting] -[glass shattering] You peak in high school? I sure didn't. Come on down to Dan the Tan, I'll give you a little glow up. I'll make you tan, I'll make you happy, I'll make you sexy. For less! ♪ Dan the Tan ♪ ♪ Tanning the whole family for less ♪ -[Jennifer] Bert, look out! -[knife clattering] -[Aaron] Holy shit. -[Cory] What the hell? -Fuck. -Holy shit. Thanks, Jen. -Aw, bud, it missed you. -[Leyla] Oh, stop it. Too early for it, Cory. Muzzle it. Why do all these weird things keep happening? The cabin is out to get us. [Aaron] I wouldn't worry about it, babe. Just have some cold pizza with me. We got a long day anyways. Hey, so, ladies, Aaron and I are going to go on a hike up to Mile's old house. You want to join? -Bert, you're welcome, too. -[Bert] Pass. I'm meeting John over at Isaac's for lunch this afternoon. We have a lot of catching up to do. Oh, that's good. Is that tanning salon we passed in town? Will you come with me later, Jennifer? Please. Of course, it'll be fun. All right, so, it looks like we meet back here at 5:00 and get ready for the reunion. You know, I can't wait to see the look on those sad Junction girls faces when we stroll into the party. -We will knock them dead. -[all laughing] This will be a night to remember. Oh, yes! -For some of us. -I need more pizza. [Cory] I don't know why you won't let me just go over there and knock his fucking lights out. Because A, I can take care of myself. B, I don't want you go to jail, and C, you're not my boyfriend anymore. Fuck, why do you have to be so fucking stubborn? Get used to it! Do you hear Cory yelling at Leyla like that? -[Cory] Fuck! -Damn. Yeah. I think he's just concerned, that's all. He still cares about her. Well, they'd still be together if he wasn't such a dick all the time. He's getting better. [glass shattering] -What the hell? -What the fuck? [Jennifer groans] Oh, God. What a mess. Look at all that broken glass. Who broke that? Wait, nobody was even in here. Nobody but the... [Cory] Fucking A, Bert. I swear to God, dude, if this is another one of your stupid pranks-- It wasn't me, all right? It wasn't me the last time either. I was in the bathroom getting ready. Cory must have left the bottle on the edge of the table. -It just finally slipped. -No, fuck you. I put it in the center of the table, and the bear wasn't fucking there. Stop arguing about this. It's just some freak accident. Okay. No harm, no foul. Whatever happened, happened. Everybody just get back to doing what you were doing. Oh, yeah, just mosey on back to your room. Never mind that my fucking expensive vodka is all over the floor. You clean it up, Cory. You have time. No matter how much time you spend primping, it doesn't change this ugly face. Oh, that's a good one. That's a good one. Just... You fucking do it. [sighs] [laughs] Yeah. [eerie music playing] [ominous chord plays] [Jennifer] Hey, Annie. [Annie] Oh, God. I can't get rid of you guys. That's a nice sparkly dress you're wearing. Hey, girl. I'm sorry, I mean, Annie. Old habits. Oh, I can see the douche canoe has arrived as well. What do you want? Look, I don't want to keep you. We're all going to the same party in a few. I just need to ask you a question. So ask. I don't have all night. I gotta go meet with my girls. Is the cheerleading squad still here? Annie, that box that you sold us? There was-- there was a teddy bear inside of it and I was just wondering if you knew where it came from. Why? What does it matter? Look, I don't give two shits about the damn thing. You guys own it. Why are you asking about the damn bear? We've been having some very strange things happen, and I think it's connected to the box somehow. Where did it come from? Do you know where you got it? Fine, I'll tell you who sold it to my granddad. -For a price. -[Jennifer grunts] -Are you fucking kidding me? -[Annie] No. Gosh, you're a real piece of work. You know, I'm so glad we never stayed together. Oh, God, that makes two of us there, Gory Cory. Matter of fact, you and that bitch Leyla deserve one another. -Or deserved one another. -[Jennifer] How much? How much do you want? Well, if it's that important to you and you're cutting into the one night that I actually have a babysitter... [exhales sharply] ...it's 100 bucks. What? I don't have any cash on me. -I can't help you. -I can go ask Leyla-- No, don't do that. I got it. Thank you. [Annie] You are most accommodating. [Cory] Here's your damn money. [Annie] Sweet. Here, the guy's name is Jim Ravenfeather. He lives on the other side of town. He was the original owner. You're welcome to go bug him about the bear. Doubt he'll be much help, though. -Thanks, Annie. Appreciate it. -Of course. [Jennifer] See you at the reunion. -Yeah. -[Cory] You know what? Don't even bother talking to me at the school. [scoffs] Know what? Get the fuck out of here. And don't worry, I won't. God damn it. God damn door. [grunts] I can't believe those guys. Fucking assholes just think they're so much better than everybody else just because they moved to the big city, moved away from here. [grunts] What am I here for? My phone. Yes. [sighs, grunts] Okay, it's all right. [exhales] It's all right. It's okay. Just breathe. We still got it, girl. [eerie distorted tones] Hello? -[eerie distorted tones] -Is someone there? Hello? Is there anybody there? Dad? [suspenseful music rising] Someone there? Daddy? Hello? Who's there? [eerie distorted tones] Hello? About to go Jamie Lee Curtis on this motherfucker. Hello? Is there anyone down here? -[thumping] -Hello? [thumping continues] Hello? Who are you? [suspenseful intensifies] Oh, shit. Oh, God. [laughing] Oh. All right. We're good. Get it together, Annie. [loud whooshing] [eerie giggling echoing] -[slicing thud] -[Annie groans] -[loud growling] -Ah! [grunts] [grunting in pain] [grunting continues] Damn it. Fuck Jamie Lee Curtis. -[slicing thud] -[Annie grunts] [upbeat electronic music playing] Well, you bet. Well, at least one of us is having a good time. Yeah, it does not surprise me that the inbreed and the toffee kid are the only ones enjoying themselves. -Oh, come on, Cory. -Yeah. Just be happy for 'em. Hey, sourpusses. Why the long faces? It wasn't that bad, right, John? [Cory] Speak for yourself, Bert. [scoffs] God, this town fucking sucks. -I'm never coming back here. -Oh, I remember you. You were such a douche in the school. That's why no one ever wanted to party with you. Hey, John? Fuck off, okay? At least I made it out of this shit hole town. I made a name for myself outside of Junction, fuckin' Texas. [laughs] I'm in a sports medicine company, and I was on Forbes' Top 100 startup companies. Right, so that's what's making you better than all of us, right, Cory? So why don't you tell us all how much money this Top 100 startup company made? Well, it's a startup company, so the money comes-- Exactly. $0. That's why Leyla had to fund this whole trip. Because you are dead B-R-O-K-E, broke. Right, Gory Cory? I told you not to fucking call me that, okay? -[Leyla] Hey, stop it. -[Jennifer] Whoa, whoa, whoa. [Aaron] Hey, hey, hey. Bert, you okay? What's your fucking problem, Cory? Motherfucker had it coming, okay? -[Jennifer] Just go. -[Aaron] Get in the car now! -Let me see, let me see. -I'm fine, I'm fine. He packs a punch, though. Ow... Do you want to go and see a doctor or something? -It might be broken. -No, no, it's fine, it's fine. Nothing a nice, cold beer couldn't fix. Here comes your shitty sense of humor. Come on, let me buy you some beer. -[John grunts] -I told you not to come-- [John] All right, you're right. Fuck it. Hey, wait. I'm coming, too. I don't want to see that sorry motherfucker right now. All right, everyone, show's over. Go back to your lame ass party. Oh, my God. We're leaving. [Danny] Fuck's going on, Aaron? Causing problems again? Oh, well, late to the fun, Danny. Oh, I'm sorry, Deputy Gibson. Don't mind us. We're leaving. Bunch of losers. [phone rings] Yes, ma'am. [woman speaking indistinctly on phone] Okay, I'm on my way. [sighs] Hey, look, sorry. Hot night with the Gibster? Gonna have to put that on hold. Duty calls. Ciao. You fucking prick. [Leyla] Okay, guys, you go ahead. See, I'm drunk. Go ahead and park the car over there. I'm gonna go inside and shower. -[Bert] That's my girl. -[Leyla] Enjoy. [John] You want us to come or no? -[Leyla] No. -[John and Burt laughing] [Bert] See you in a bit. -[John] She's a hoot. -[Bert] Yeah, she is. [John] So amazing. [Bert] Oh, man. [John] Just careful-- It's like-- [Bert] I know, this garage is like- [car beeping] All right, a little more? That's good enough. Man. So that's what these cars are like, huh? I've always wanted to drive one of these. Well, I was buzzed, so. Thank you so much. No problem. What the hell she meant by that? -What? Leyla? -Mm-hmm. Who knows. That girl's as ditzy as a bat. [laughs] Well... it was great catching up with you. -You too, John. -[John chuckles] To be honest, I was surprised to see you with... Aaron and Cory earlier today. I never figured you'd be part of their posse. I mean... they used to bully you back in the days. And Cory still does. Yeah. Look... Cory's a big-time asshole. But Aaron and Jennifer are my real friends. Even Leyla, in a weird way. And yeah, the boys used to bully me a bit back in high school, but college really gave us a chance to bond and reconnect. And some of us outgrew the pettiness. -Notice I said some of us. -[John laughs] Well, you know how to make people laugh. I always liked that about you, Bert. [upbeat rock music playing] We had so much fun together. I mean, you and me. I really missed you. And I haven't seen you in a long, long time. I know, John. It sucks, man. I'm busy on the road so much with my comedy act. And you, Mr. Big Shot real estate agent -in all of Kimble County. -Thank you. [chuckles] Look, I promise, you know, I'm gonna do my best to make it back here more now that you and I have connected again. Hey, Bert. I want to tell you something. I think you already know, but... I just want to tell you, otherwise... I'm going to regret for the rest of my life. John, it's okay, you don't have to-- Just let me say it, okay? I just-- Otherwise I'm gonna lose my nerve. Okay. Here goes nothing. Bert Galindo... I think-- -[stabbing] -[John gasps] [frantic music playing] John! No, John! [ominous growling] What the fuck is going on? [rock music playing on phone] [choking] [louder rock music playing] [grunts and gasps] [hums] Bloody hell. They're taking their time. [sighs] Long day, long shower. Lovely. Let's see what's going on. There is... [muffled murmuring] They will like it. Hey, guys, I don't mean to interrupt whatever you are doing, but I've got two cold ones. Can you hear me? Hello? -[knocks] -Hello? [bottles clattering] [Leyla screams] [suspenseful music playing] [rustling metal dragging] [Leyla screaming] -[growling] -[screaming] [screams] [echoing thud] [sirens wailing in the distance] All right. Okay. [police radio chatter] [grunts] Damn. Oh, that's a damn shame. God damn it! Oh, God. Hey, Sheriff-- Holy shit. Is that Annie Eastman? Yeah, it is, Gibson. That's a shitty-ass way to go. [sheriff grunts] Yeah, that's too bad. She was very nice to me and my girls. All the time. What the hell happened? Was she murdered? Yeah. Stabbed, pretty certain. Look at that. Yep. What do you think you make something like that with? Well, something precise, something long. You know, it almost seems like a-- like a-- like a glove with little knives at the end, you know, like Freddy Krueger. [laughs] Just a joke. Yeah, I know. [sighs] But, honestly, what do you think could do that? -It looks like a pitchfork. -Yeah. You guys can go. Yeah, yeah, a pitchfork, yeah. That might be it, Gibson, that's pretty smart. Listen, why don't you go... check the perimeter, make sure there's nothing we missed or something? Yeah. I got to go check on Dan the Tan 'cause I guess he won't be open for business tomorrow, will he? -Dan, too? -[sheriff] Yeah. Shit. You know, he and I used to go fishing all the time. -Did you really? -Yeah. What'd you guys catch? You know, the usual. Trout. Whatever's in the river. -Bluegill? -One or two, maybe. -Perch? -[Danny] Yeah. [chuckles] You know something? I don't give a shit. Right. Why don't you just go take a look like I told you to and just follow an order? Yes, sir. [grunts and spits] Holy fuck. Damn, how did this happen? Okay, guys. Time to go now. Get out of here. It's a crime scene and you both shouldn't be here, and you know that, so get out. Look, we know that's Annie. We went to school with her. -What the fuck happened? -Yeah. Okay. It's a homicide investigation, all right? That's all I'm gonna say. The both of you, get out of here. You don't, I'll get Deputy Gibson to come over and escort you out. Maybe I'll just arrest the both of yous. Okay? It's up to you. Let's go, bro. Sheriff's being a fucking dick. [laughing] And Jennifer's in the car waiting. [sheriff] It's time to get going. Let's get the hell out of here. There's nothing we could do anyway. No, you're right about that, son. -[Aaron] Danny. -Shit! Jesus Christ. By the way, it's Deputy, remember? Lawman. Yeah, well, I kicked your ass plenty of times in high school. -[Aaron] We got a question. -What? Do y'all know who killed Annie? No. I do not know who killed Annie. The only thing I know is whoever's doing it is very creative and a sick motherfucker. We just saw her before the reunion. -Yeah, yeah. -Wait. You saw her earlier? Like, you were the last ones to see her alive? I don't know. What were y'all doing? She was closing up shop, and Jen wanted to talk about... a teddy bear. Okay, look, I don't have time for this. I gotta get back to my boss. Y'all just be careful and get the hell out of here, okay? All right. Thanks, Danny. [sighs] It's Deputy. [mayor] Robert, you need to clean this shit up pronto. Listen, Mayor, how was I supposed to know there was gonna be two homicides in this town? The worst thing that ever happened around here was kids popping wheelies up at the dunes or shooting drugs somewhere. What the hell was I supposed to know this kind of thing would happen around here? Honestly? Listen, this town is on its last leg thanks to the development of Kerrville. We need all the tourism we can get. People need to spend money in Junction. If they don't spend money, we don't get funds. You don't get funds! And I can't keep tapping the city coffer. -Comprende? -Oh, I comprende. Little bit more than you might remember, I comprende. I know all about your embezzling and so do you, by the way, before you jump ship on me. Best jump of my life. [chuckles] Apparently. Good for you. Listen, how would you like it if I let that white trash reporter know all about your little late night gambling problems, huh? -You wouldn't dare. -Wanna bet? You try me, bub. You fucking prick. [laughs] You keep putting that goddamn thing in my face and we'll see who crosses who. -[Mayor] Listen, Robert. -Yeah? You need to do your job or I'm going to fire your ass. Go ahead and do that, you bald-headed prick. Let's go, Julie. Yeah. [clicks tongue] [spits] What the hell do you want? What the hell was that about? [laughs] It's about the mayor being a bald-headed prick. Same goddamn thing. Did you find out anything else? Actually, yeah. Remember that group that we pulled over yesterday? Yeah. Well, Aaron Johnson and his friends... Yeah. ...saw both victims before they were murdered. No kidding? Wow. Well, that's interesting. [rocks crunching] [eerie music] Leyley? -Bert? -Bert? Where are they? There's no car outside. That's-- that's weird. Leyla? Hey Ley, you here? [suspenseful music playing] Maybe they're out in the garage. -[Aaron] I should go check. -No, I'll-- I'll go. I should probably patch things up with Bert. Oh, that's real mature of you. [crickets chirping] Uh... [knocking on window] Hey, guys, uh, I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but... I know you're probably still pissed at me, but I was thinking, what if you, uh... What if I let you hit me as hard as you can? Just to even things out? What do you say? Hey. I'm-- I'm trying to apologize here. Hey, guys, what the-- What the fuck? What the-- Who the fuck are you? -[electric buzzing] -[eerie growling] Hey! We need to get out of here now. Like, right fucking now, okay? What the fuck's gotten into you? Bert and John are dead in the car. What? Is this a sick fucking joke? I'm not fucking joking, okay? They're in the fucking car, dead. And we need to get out of here right now. -What is going on? Cory! -[Cory] There was this this little girl or something. She was, like, sick or rabid, and she threw-- she tried to kill me with a pitchfork, and I think she killed Bert and John. What? Hold on. You saw someone out there? -What? -[Cory yelps] [Jennifer screams] [Cory] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [Aaron] Who the fuck-- who the fuck was that? [Jennifer] We need to leave. Call the police. We gotta get out of here. [Cory] Wait, wait, wait. Where's Leyla? Shit, Leyla. [all] Leyla! Leyla? [Jennifer screams] -What? -What the fuck, man? Oh, my God. Okay. Cory, come on. Come on, bro. She's-- she's gone, man. She's gone, Cory. What the fuck are you waiting for? -Cory, she's gone, dude! -Show yourself! -Cory, get in the car. -I'll fucking kill you! She's-- she's gone, man, she's gone. Get in the car. Get in the car, Cory. Okay, I'll call the police. Shit. No signal, fuck! -Fuck. Fuck! -[Jennifer] Fuck. [tense music playing] [clock ticking] Hey, buddy. Hey, hey, hey. [body thumps] Oh, shit. Guys, we gotta get the fuck out of here. -[Jennifer] What's going on? -[Aaron] She killed the deputy. -So what do we do? -Please, please... -[car stalling] -Fuck. Fuck. Shit. We got-- we gotta make a run for it. -Fuck. -[Aaron] Yeah, we gotta. We gotta go. Fucking bear. [all panting] [Benji] Yeah. Who is it? Sorry. My friends and I, we're looking for a Jim Ravenfeather. We were told this is the right address. Maybe it is. What's it to you? We voted for that other guy, if that's why you're here. No, no, um, we were told Mr. Ravenfeather could help us. -Does he live here? -Sure he lives here, gorgeous. Jim Ravenfeather's my grandfather. Why do you need to see him? And exactly who are you, gorgeous? -Leave her alone. -Whoa, chill. I meant nothing by it. But like I said... Who are you? I'm Jennifer. This is Aaron. That's Cory. We were told Mr. Ravenfeather could help us. Can we see him? He never leaves the house anymore. Not since... For a while. You can come in, I guess. But he may not be up for visitors. And if he isn't, then you got to get the fuck out of here. Understand? Ye-- yes. Thank you. [eerie music] [Jim] Who are these people? Grandfather, I let these white folks in. They need your help, they said. This here's Jennifer and, uh, I forgot your other two's names. [Aaron] Sir, my name's Aaron Johnson. This is my fiancée, Jennifer Corolla, and that's my brother, Cory. [Jim] Corolla? As in Franky Corolla? That old son of a bitch that used to own the pizza parlor in town? [laughs] Yeah, that's my dad. Did you know him? It's a little town, little lady. I know a lot about this town. I know a lot about your family. Guys, we don't have time for this, that pitchfork girl killed our friends, and she's still fucking looking for us. What the fuck are you talking about? Man, I knew you white people were fucking crazy. What'd you call me? Get the fuck out of our goddamn house. Benji. Please continue. Several people have been murdered. It all started when we got this old box from Annie Eastman. She said you sold it to her? Is the box still sealed? Tell me you did not open the box. Yes, we opened the fucking box, there was a fucking teddy bear. What the fuck, Grandpa? Is that what we felt the other night? Son of a bitch. After all these decades, she's come back. You said she... she was killing townspeople? She slaughtered our friends. She's still looking for us. Please. Do you know how to stop her? There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. You came all this way for nothing. Please, Mr. Ravenfeather, I'm begging you. We don't know how to stop her. She killed our friends, people in the town, she's gonna kill us, too. Do you want that on your conscience? There's nothing I can do. Fuck, we're wasting our time with this dumbass Indian. -Hey, watch it, motherfucker. -[Aaron] Please. Excuse my brother. He's an idiot. But, sir, our friends are dead. Please, help us. We have no other options. You're our last hope. You have to know something. For the love of God, for your town, for the people in it... tell us what you know. Please. I was the witness... the only witness... of the birth of pure evil. Of a powerful vengeance. Of a wraith... named Ami Cutter. Ami and I were friends. I first met Ami... after my father lost our family home. And her father, her... stepfather... purchased it at auction. I used to go every Sunday down to their farm... for high tea... with her... and her stuffed bear. It was one of those Sundays... that's when I... I saw her murdered... at the hands... of her stepfather. He picked up a pitchfork... and ran her through. It wasn't until the next night that I summoned up the courage... to go back to the farm to see what had happened to her father. -You know what? -[Ami screaming] [Jim] After seeing him talking to himself, drinking, laughing, and crying... I swore I could hear a voice. It caught the attention of her father. [breathing shakily] He started to yell out her name. And that's when I heard her laughter. [laughter echoing] Then she appeared... like a mist. She took the pitchfork... and ran her father through. Then the strangest thing happened. She reached down... and picked up the teddy bear. She hugged it... and she looked up at me... but she was looking right through me. And then she disappeared. [sobbing] I ran over. I picked up the bear. The only thing I had left of my friend. I ran home with the bear and I put it... in a suitcase. I kept it safe for 30 years. Until I... sold it to the Eastmans. I think they knew what was in it. Wait, who was Ami's real father? [Jim] Ami's real father... was a man that Ami's mother was having an affair with. He was sheriff at the time. Well, why is she killing us? Why is she chasing us? We didn't do anything wrong. You haven't done anything wrong. [thunder rumbling] I should have gotten rid of the bear properly. It's the bear. It's the connection between her and the world of the living. She must have a human host. She must have her blood... the blood of her relations. She'll eventually fade away, unless she possesses a relative of hers? Yes, she must have that human host and she's growing weak. The more she kills, the stronger she gets. Mr. Ravenfeather... who is Ami's blood? Don't ask questions... that you know the answer to. Wait, so are you saying Jennifer is Ami's blood? Ami's real father was Sheriff Corolla. Jennifer's grandfather. Well, how do we kill this bitch? You cannot kill it. It is energy. And energy, you can only hope to transform it or contain it. Well, can we just put the bear back in the box? Can we do the box thing again? We cannot. The seal has been broken, and it would take too long to recreate it. The only hope is to bury it... in consecrated ground. Unless anyone who looks at it... or touches it... will feel the wraith within. Like a cemetery? Is there one close by? Yes, if you cut through the old rodeo ground, you'll end up at Red Rock Cemetery. We just have to fucking bury this? [eerie music playing] Peckerwood, I know you're not that stupid. Do you realize what you've just done? -[Jennifer] I'm sorry. -[Jim] Please. I'm sorry. Exit our home. Damn you all. Get them the fuck out. [Cory] So over this Evil Dead shit... [dog barking] [Jim screaming] [frantic music playing] [Benji] Grandad? [Benji grunts] -[stabbing] -[Benji grunting] So, Bert and Leyla, whoever else the fuck is dead because it's Jennifer's fault. -Cory, back off, it's not-- -Don't fucking hit me! -[Aaron] Cory, back off. -I'll kick your ass. I don't want to fight you. I just want to get rid of this damn curse and make it out of here alive. I'm sure Bert would like to get out alive. -Or John, or Leyla. -Cory-- I'm sure she'd like to not be fucking dead. Okay, enough. Stop it. This isn't helping. Okay, we have to figure out how to end this so that nobody else dies. I don't fucking care who else dies, she's dead. Leyla? You never knew how much she meant to me, did you? -Cory, I'm-- -Forget it. I gotta fucking finish this for Bert and Leyla. Come on, let's go. [somber music playing] [faint panting] [suspenseful music playing] [Aaron] Babe. Babe. Oh, my God, are you okay? What happened to your arm? How long has it been like that? [Cory yells] What the fuck? Oh, my God. Cory! -[Jennifer] Cory. -[Aaron] Cory! [farmer] What y'all doing here? This is private property, you can't be here. [Cory] He scared the shit out of me, okay? Put the pitchfork away. Please, sir, we just need to find the main road. We got lost. Just lead us in the right direction. Um, okay. It's over this way. Follow me. I don't know how you got here this time of night. -[stabbing] -[grunts] [Cory yelps] -[Jennifer pants] -Oh, shit. Shit. [Cory yells] -Aaron, run! -Cory, no! Hey! Not so tough without your toy, huh? [Aaron] Cory! [Cory screams] [Ami] [echoing] This way. Trust me. Jen. Jen. [crickets chirping] Oh, shit. Cutter. Jen! Jennifer? Babe! Where are you? Trust me. Jen! Get away from her! [Ami] [distorted] Jennifer. Jen. [pitchfork clattering] Jen. Jen. You gotta fight her, Jen. Please. Fight her. This isn't you. This is not you. J-- Jen, you don't have to do this. [panting] Jen. Please. Please. Please, Jen, fight her. Please. Please, Jen, I love you, please. [screams] [screaming] -[Jennifer pants] -Are you okay? [panting] Aaron. I can't. [Aaron] Jen. Aaron, I can't, I can't hold on. Jen, you have to fight her. Please, she's too strong. It's too late for me. There's only one way to end this. -I'm not doing it, Jen. -If you don't, she'll kill you. I couldn't live without you, either. Please. Jen. -[Aaron] I can't. -[Jennifer] Aaron. Shh. I love you. We have to keep going. [demonic screaming] [demonic roaring] I'm sorry, baby. [Jennifer grunts] -[sirens wailing] -I'm sorry, baby. [sobbing] [melancholic music playing] [muffled chatter] He's not having a great day. Oh, look who's here. What's the story, Sheriff? I don't know. You tell me. I-- I don't understand any of this shit. This is all I know is he come in here, talking about ghosts and, uh, voodoo magic and, uh, the whole town is cursed and, uh... everyone's getting stabbed and... [chuckles] ...his fiancée's dead, and no motive. And it all ends up in the Cutter Farm or Cutter Ranch and... everybody stabbed to death, all his friends. It's all from, uh, Ami Cutter. All right? And, uh, wha-- what'd you say she was? Some kind of wraith. A wraith. Whatever that is. Christ. Curse? We don't need the town talking about curses. We need a concrete explanation, for the good of this town, and my tourist money. I think we need the truth, mayor. Truth? We can make the truth anything we want. This is the age of misinformation. Let's use it to our advantage. [Julie] Whatever you say. I'm on your payroll. [mayor] And here's the story. Aaron Johnson came back to town enacting his sick, violent fantasies. But our beloved sheriff... saved the day by getting a confession and can put him away for good. End of story. We cleansed the town of any curse. Use that. [sheriff grunts] Love to watch her leave. [sighs] [sheriff grunts] So, what do we do now, sheriff? [sighs] [somber music playing] I'm gonna tell the truth... just like the mayor asked. Whatever in the hell that's gonna be. [Marlene] Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Marlene Rogers, KFOT. We know who the fuck you are. You do this all the time. Was the killer caught tonight? The mayor's not making any comments right now, Marlene. -So back off. -Whoa, whoa, Josie. -I do have a comment. -Come on! I do have a comment. Tonight, our local law enforcement apprehended native Aaron Johnson for murder. He's been accused of murdering the local town folk, friends, and suspected of murdering his fiancée, Jennifer Corolla. -Does this have anything to-- -[Josie] No more comments. No more comments, Marlene. The ghost girl that's been roaming this area-- Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor, eyewitnesses have been seeing this. Mr. Mayor! [contemplative music] [sighs] [eerie electronic music playing] Holy shit. That Ami fucking Cutter.
