- It's all right to do that because... - No, no, no, no. That's disgusting. - Eww, gross. - Yep, yep, yep. - My gosh, your hair is so cute. - It's your first day today? - You excited. - Yeah. - Yeah? You don't sound very excited. How was your? Isn't that what that little Mexican dude on Sesame Street calls Frosted Flakes? - I don't know what is wrong with your daddy. - Hey did you get enough to eat? - Yeah. - Yeah, you want anything else? - No, thanks. - No? - All right, you got everything packed up? You ready to go? - Um - All right, tell bad Daddy bye. - Hey did you feed your dog? - No, I did. - No? All right, easy, easy. Hey listen, you have the best day today, okay? And we're gonna be nice to people, and what do we do? - Make sure others are being nice too. - And we don't pick on anyone. - Don't let on anyone pick on anybody else. - I love you. - All right, bye daddy. - I'll see you right after school. - Bye. - Love you. - I love you. - I'll see you later. - Yes, you will. Stop. All right, let's go. Come on. - Sticky and humid with a high of 96. With the winds out of the east at 14 miles per hour. It's currently 75 degrees. - Hey. - Hi. - I was just leaving. - Okay. - Here's your coffee. - Thanks. - Good morning, Waylon. - Good morning, Janet. I was just wondering if you could tell me who send out these welcome to the new school year letters. - I do. - You do? - I'm so sorry. It's an automated system through the computer that prints out the letters and the labels. - Right, right, right but someone has to put the information in there and take it out. Ain't you the person in charge of that? - Yes. - Yeah, so you could've taken Justine's name outta there. - I'm so sorry. - Well you know Justine's dead. You were at the funeral. - Yes... - Listen, let me tell you what's a good fucking time is getting this in the mail and having my wife crying because you didn't want to do your fucking job. As if we needed another reminder that our little girl ain't here no more, Janet, because every fuckin' thing does. - Waylon. - I just want to come by this morning and say thank you for reminding me my little girl ain't gonna start third grade this year. - Waylon, I'm so sorry. - Have yourself a lovely day, Janet. Yo. - Hey grab a gallon in front of the fridge. - How much is it? - Mom said to put it on her bill. - I'll just pay. - There's a trap in there too. - What? - Dad broke the trap in the kitchen sink or somethin'. - Of course he did. Did he flood the house? - Mom didn't say. - I don't have time for this shit today. - What's wrong? - Nothing, just another day. You got any? - No, I don't. Dad says hurry. He's waiting on the milk. - Hey! - Yo! - What took you so long? Can't eat without something to drink. - They didn't have any whole milk. They only had skim. - That right there, see that's what they get for not letting Raylene do the ordering. That old lady that runs the place is worthless as tits on a boar hog. - He's just pulling your leg, you old grump. - It's true. - Here is your whole milk. - I wouldn't have been surprised. - What are you doing underneath the sink anyway? - I was fixing it. It had a leak. - No, it did not. The thing was clogged up. It only started to leak once you took the trap out, couldn't figure out how to put it back in. - You've just got it cross threaded. All right, turn the faucet on. Wow, look at that. - Work? - Yeah of course it is. - I couldn't see what I was doing under there. - Well that's more the reason to leave it run. - What's the matter? - My back hurts. - Grab one of my pills and take one. - Where they at? - Right in front of ya on the counter. - Bring me one. - You only have three in here. - That's all right, take it. - I'll call the drugstore and get a refill. - You've been taking more of those than you're supposed to? - I only take what you give me. - You want me to stop on my way home and pick 'em up for you? - No, that's all right, honey. I gotta go to town anyway. - You sure? - Yep. - All right, well call if you need anything, all right? - Bye. - Hey stay our from underneath that sink. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can't get these. - Hey Waylon, got a second? - I'll see you, boy. - Could you get that door, Waylon? - What can I do for you? - I got a paper here that I need you to have your doctor sign. - What kind of paper? - It's just a paper saying that you have prescription. - What are you talking about? - You know your drug test came back saying you had opioids in your system which is fine provided that you have a prescription. - Well I ain't got no prescription. I mean I took a pain pill. - I understand. But you know with these fellas, opioids can mean any number of things. So they just wanna see a script. - Well what does it mean? - No script, it means a failed drug test. - Okay but Jimmy, I just told you I don't have no script, so what does it mean? - They will assume the worst without a script. - Well I will tell 'em it's my dad's, and it's because of all these orders right here. I mean Jimmy, when they start cutting the ever living shit out of them posts, it hurts my fucking back so bad I can barely sleep at night. Jimmy, have I ever missed a day? - No. - Never been late. Don't have a write up for nothing. - I know. - I got a back that hurts when they decide China needs a post cut for a week. - Well you can take the test again. We give everyone the chance to take it again if something shows up the first time. - Of course, I'll do whatever they want. - Okay, okay good. You got four days. I want you to go back and see that same doctor. And Waylon, buddy, this one's got to be clean. - It will be. - Now go on home. - I appreciate you, Jimmy. - Good evening, Waylon. - Toby! Here boy! Hey babe? Hey how are you? - Hi. - How's it going? - Good. - Thank you, darlin'. I stopped by the board of education this morning. - I know. They called me. - What are you up to? You wanna sit for a minute? - I'm just watching a show. Just gonna go to bed. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm just tired. - I'm gonna sit with you for a minute. Down at the car wash. - Your feet hurt? Here I'll rub 'em for you. - Babe, don't worry about it. Just eat. - It's all right. How was your day? - Fine. - Work good? - Yep. - You guys get a lot done today? - Waylon. - Sorry. - Here. I think I'm just gonna go to bed. - I'll come with you. - No, just stay. - I'm wore out, babe. - Waylon. - What's wrong? Babe, what's wrong? - I can't do this anymore. - What? - This. You. I can't be with you like this anymore. - Babe... - I can't. - We're working on this. It's getting better. - No, no. No, we're not. Asking me how my day was and how my job was is not communicating. It's not talking. It's small talk. I fucking hate small talk. I don't wanna talk about my day. - Babe, we can't just keep talking about the bad shit all the time. - Please, come on, Waylon. I want a divorce. - How are you, babe? - Well, well, look at you. You ain't so bad on the country scale. - Shut up. - But you're taken though, aren't ya? - Is that what you're sayin'? - Yeah, you really grabbed my heart. - My god, you want the Turkey? - Yeah, that'll do it. - Are you doing all right? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay, I'll be right back. Here you go. - Thank you. - Where's Raylene? - I don't know. I hate to break it to you though. She really ain't gay. - Who the hell says that? God damn it, Waylon. - It's good seeing you over there the other night. Don't worry, I ain't gonna tell no one. - It's time for a warm up. You want one? - Yeah. You got the cream in here tonight, don't you? - All the good boys are home with their wives. - Is that so? - Cheers, babe. - Cheers. - I'll be back. - Thank you. Hey bud. - What's the matter with you, Waylon? Something wrong? - Charlie, fuck off. - Ease up, buddy. - You got a problem, Waylon? - Okay now, it's time to go home. Come on, get outta here. - Mom, Waylon's up. - Major focus this hour on the island of Puerto Rico. Maria hitting land as a category four hurricane. This storm's a killer. We mentioned before how dangerous this storm has become. FEMA administrator Brock Long with me now live out of Washington DC. - Nida told me to move out. She wants a divorce. - What are you doing? What are you hearing about this storm now? - So yesterday, we were looking at a very fierce but compact storm. - No, I am not doing this alone. - That's what I thought. I figured this would play out just about like this. - That's right walk away like you always do. - Where's Waylon? - On the porch. - Okay, go on out and talk to him. - Why? - Would it kill you to say something nice to your son? Just get out there for God's sake. - Don't tell no one, but they're gonna stock the river tomorrow. They said they're gonna put 500 pound of fish up Back Fork in the mornin'. - I figure the secret'll be out by the time the stock truck goes up the road, don't you think? - Probably. They should stock in the winter. That'd keep some fish in the water. Hey your mom wanted me to talk to you. Wanted me to tell you you could stay here if you needed to. Told her you'd probably stay with Raylene. But you know you can if you want. Well gotta go see if the food's ready. Hey Raylene. - Hey. How are you? - I'm good. - Yeah? Let me see those hands. Looks like it. - Can I get one of your pills, Dad? - Yeah, here. - Thank you. You need anything from town? - No. - I'll be back in a bit. - Okay. - Waylon leave? - Yeah. - You didn't give him any of your pills, did you? - I gave him one. - Bill. - What? - And what about you, young lady? When are you gonna cut this shit out? - Enough with it, Mom. - People talk, Raylene. - All right, I'm not listening to this. - Well you think that they don't. You think that we don't hear? - Well let's hear it. What are they sayin'? - Yeah exactly. You always worried about what people think. - I happen to care about you. - You want one? - No thank you. - I still haven't seen the dog. - Just keep food out, he'll turn up in a bit. He always does. Listen I'm gonna take the rocking chair, okay? - Yeah, take whatever you want. - That's it. - You gonna stay with your parents? - No. - I don't think it's a good idea to stay at Raylene's. - Well I don't have much of a choice, do I? - Well I can help you. I mean I can help you find a place. There's the apartments up Back Fork. - That's okay. - You know my parents, they also have that couch, and those side tables. It's fine. I can help you. - Listen, it's all good, I'm good. - Would you just stop please. I mean, Waylon, don't you wanna talk about all of this shit with it not being a screaming fight? Don't you want to talk about why? - Pretty obvious, ain't it? - Is that why you don't talk about Justine 'cause it's obvious she's gone? - See this is what I ain't doin'. I'm not doing it. - You never do. Yeah, that's right. Walk away like you always do. I'm all alone, Waylon. Something, anything, I never know what you're thinking or feeling because you won't talk to me. - I don't want a divorce. How 'bout that? But that don't much matter, does it? - Well I wouldn't know what if anything affected you because you're emotionless. It's just, it's nothing, nothing, nothing, and then you blow up. It's like the only emotion you know is anger. - You think I don't care about you or this? - You're so level until you're mad. I don't know what you're feeling. - Maybe that was for you. Did you ever think about that? - If that was for me, then why don't I feel so much love? - I don't know, darling, 'cause I've been right here this whole time. There ain't a whole lot of times where what I'm thinking or feeling when you're constantly in tears. - I have gone through this by myself. I am drowning here. - And you're asking me to save you when I can't swim myself. I'm sorry you felt a lack. Ray? - I need four 30s. - That'll be 80 bucks. Don't have it. - Not gonna pay anything? - Not 80. - I was hoping you weren't gonna pay anything, Raylene. Pretty little blouse on when I saw you drive up. I like it when you do it. Yeah. - Hey Jimmy. - What do you say there, Waylon? Listen buddy, I was real sorry to hear what happened between you and Nida. - Appreciate that, bud. - We'll get it sorted out though. - Well if there's anything you need, you just let me know. - I will for sure. - Okay. Hey, did you get that test scheduled yet? - Yeah, I'm going on Tuesday. - Sounds good. - It's only ever in your system about three days, but you drink the tea the whole day, and you take the B3. You're gonna piss all day long, but at least you'll be clean. - All right. - Why don't you just get a script? I know a doc in DC who'll write you one for two grand. - I ain't getting no script, bud. - It'll make your headache go away. - Yeah, I'll end up dead too. - Nah, look at me. - That's what I'm afraid of. You seen yourself lately. Listen I really appreciate it. All right, buddy. - You missed some. You can't mow with a weed eater. - You can mow it yourself if you want. - Come on. - Where're you going? - Fishin'. - I ain't going fishin'. - Come on. I can't go by myself. I might fall in a river and drown. - I can mow in peace then. - Come on. - My stuff's at the house. - What's that you're drinkin'? - It's tea. - Tea? - Yeah, it's tea. - Tea. You're drinking tea. - I'll be right back. - My God, he's in there. He's in there! He's in there. - Whoa. - I don't know what happened to him. - Nida stop. - I don't know what happened. - Calm down, calm down. I'm right here, I'm right here. What is it? Tell me. - It's Toby, he's dead. He's in there. He's dead. Take her inside. Go now. One day without somethin'. Hello? - Waylon. - What are you doing? - Hey what are you doing here? - I came to get you. - I can't leave yet. I feel amazing. - She can't leave. She's hanging with me. - Waylon. - She ain't hanging with you. - It's time to go home, come on. - I can't get up. - Get your stuff. - Hey where are you going. - Waylon. - Shit. - We're going home, let's go. - I feel so good. - Now. - Don't you be jealous, missy. - Raylene, go home. - You're comin' too. Come on. - I'm so sorry, Waylon. - It's not your fault, darlin'. - I'm sorry. - You all right? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well it was good seeing you tonight. Darlin', she's no good for you. - Hey Waylon. - Hey there. - You here for your drug test? - Actually would it be possible to see a doctor for a minute? - Sure, come on back. We'll take care of ya. - Hey Jim. - What do you say there, Waylon? - I just got back from the doctor. I wanted to drop this off to you. - I didn't think they'd have the results for another few days. - Well they won't, but that's for the prescription. - Prescription? - Yeah, yeah for the oxy, so you can send it along with the other when it comes it. - I didn't think you had one. - Well I didn't, but then I got to talking with the doctor, and I told her how I take one of my dad's pills every now and then, you know when my back would flare up. She thought that was okay, so she wrote me a script. - She gave you any indication what it might be. - She likely just said it was you know just muscle spasms or somethin'. She says it wasn't a chronic pain. So as long as I'm just taking 'em as I need to it'll be okay. - Okay, glad you got it sorted out. Hopefully it helps with that pain there. - Yeah, yeah, I think it will. You know I'm just taking one every now and then. You know to get some sleep. - Okay, I'll just put this with your file there, bud. - And hey, she said to give 'em a call if you had any questions. - I think this'll be just fine. - All right, I'll see you, Jim. - See you Waylon. - Hey. Look I'm sorry. Please don't try to make me feel any worse than I already do. It was stupid. - It was stupid. - I pissed you off. I pissed Nona off. I fucked up, and I get it. Just I don't need a guilt trip on top of it, okay? - Put that in your pocket. - Where did you get these? You got a prescription? - Stay away from those places. You stay away from Cotton. You think I didn't know about that? - You don't know what you're talking about. - You think I don't know what you're doin' for pills? I know it's not a problem for you to get 'em if you don't have any money. And I know they don't give 'em away for free. You're gonna get yourself hurt. - Don't give me your self righteous bullshit. - If you wanna do drugs, you get 'em, and you do 'em at the house. Look at me. Look at me. Now I'm not always gonna be around to be your babysitter. - What have you been saying for the past three days? I'm not gonna take another pill, and then you go to the doctor and get a prescription. You're no better. - Darlin, I don't get high and lay in bed with a bunch of using jerk offs that I don't fuckin' know. - You think you're better than everybody who took a pill once for fun and now they can't stop? You think because you lost a kid it gives you the right to blow that shit up your nose? Waylon. Waylon, stop. Fuck. Hey. - What's going on here? - You said do it at home. - You got a few pills, and you got a few friends? - Come and have a beer. - I gotta work in the morning. - Come on you can have one beer. Let's go. - Come on. Come on. - What are you all smiling for? You didn't check this one out, did you? - Why not? - So why are you staying here with Raylene now? - Who said I was? - It's what I heard. - You did? - Small town. - Grapevines are good for growing gapes, darlin', and that's about it. - Is that so? - Um - It's hot, isn't it? You want another beer? - I'm gonna head in a minute. - You want anything else? - No, I'm good. Nice to see you though. I'm going in. I'll see you, darlin'. - All right. I'm still in here. - Yeah, I know. You want to? Come on. I want you. - Stop. - What? - No, I'm not doing this. Stop. - Come on. No one's gonna know. I won't say anything. I know you want to. - Listen, I know what you want. All right, stop embarrassing yourself. - What did you do? - What, your brother's an asshole. - What the fuck did you say? What did you say? Get the fuck outta here. - Hello? - Hey babe. - Jesus, you scared me. What's goin' on? - I miss you. - I can't. - Why? Why? I need you. Baby, I want you. - No, you want sex. Babe, stop. I don't feel that way about you anymore. You can have sex with someone else. It's fine. - I don't want to. - You're allowed. - That's fucked up, babe. - It's what you want to hear me say, right? You can have sex with someone. You're allowed. I give you permission. - You want me to have sex with someone else? Is that what you wanna do? You do that there's no coming back from it. It's over. - It is. It is over. - Babe, we haven't even tried. Baby, we're just trying to survive. Now we can. - No, I'm done. I'm done trying. - Listen, this is worth fighting for, damn it. We didn't get married and have a baby for nothing. I'm not going to walk away from that. Please, let's just give this a chance. - No. No. Too much has changed. Too much has changed. I love you. I'll always love you, but this, this is done. It's over. - Hey Waylon. - Hey what you doing? - I was just hurting a little bit. - I still have some coffee in the kitchen. - Actually just looking for a few of your pills. - I don't think I have many left. - I just need a couple to sleep that's all. - What about yours? - Where's yours at? I wanna see how many you got in there. Don't worry, I'll look. I'm gonna see how many you have in there. - Honey, you don't need those pills. - I need 'em mama. My back's in a bad way. - No, you're in a bad way because of those bills. Dad! - Waylon, leave it alone. - Sweetheart. - Here we are. Stop, stop! - You gonna bring her back when you're done with it? - Good morning. - Hi pretty. - Hi. - I gotta pee. You scared the crap outta me. What are you doing? - What? - Waylon? Hey you gotta go to work. Waylon? Waylon? My God, what you do, Waylon? Hey? Hey, Waylon! Hey. Look at me. - My God. - My God, what you do? - What happened. - Hey, hey! - Raylene what do I? - Wake up! - Should I call 911? Should I call. I'm gonna call 911, Raylene. - Wake up. My god. - Is he okay? - Fuck. - What's going on with him? Is he okay, Raylene? - Yes, hang up. What the fuck is this shit? I told you don't do that shit alone. If you wanna do it, you do it with me. - Stop, stop. - Holy shit. What the fuck is wrong with you? Holy shit. Fuck that shit. - I'm okay. - What are you doin'? Fuck Raylene, that's not okay. It's not okay. - It's okay. Hey, it's all right. It's okay. - Hey. Thanks. I've gotta pay it today. - Yeah, it's all right. Listen we need to figure something out 'cause I can't keep paying the mortgage and giving you money too and living somewhere else. - I know. I was thinking it might be best to sell it. - You wanna try and rent it? - We couldn't get near enough in rent to cover the mortgage. You'll still be payin'. - I was just thinking for down the road if this worked out. - Yeah so, I'll talk to someone and try and sell it, you know if it's okay with you. Be better without the headache. - Yeah if that's what you want. - Okay. You'll help get the place cleaned up? Yeah, it looks pretty bad right now. Don't forget to bring the mower and the weed eater back. - Well they're gone, darlin'. - What? - Yeah, I pawned 'em. - That mower was $5,000. My parents gave us that, Waylon. I'm sure we can borrow my dads. I'll call him. He can come meet us at the house. Waylon, you don't look good. What can I do? - Nothin'. - You can't keep this up. You need help, babe. - I do? You tuck tail and run, and leave me with no home and no wife, and you expect me to believe that you're worried about my wellbeing? - We weren't happy, Waylon, neither one of us. - No darlin', you weren't happy. Don't lump me into your feelings. I used to hold your hand at night while you slept 'cause that was the only time you'd let me. - See you inside. - Sign here. Here you go, last one. After I go to the courthouse tomorrow and get these filed, it'll only be a week or two before you get your judgment in the mail, and we have everything we need here. So there's no reason the divorce won't be final. - Hello? We're closed. - Hey Ray, ray. Where you been? I haven't seen you for awhile. - We're closed for the night, Cotton. - It's okay. I ain't shoppin'. - What do you want? - Why haven't you come see me for awhile? - Waylon's on his way over. - No, he ain't. I wanted to tell ya. I miss you. I was just hoping that you're not buying from nobody else. - I gave it up. - Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray... - I don't need it no more. - Yeah well I heard you get your pills from your brother. He has a script now. Is he selling? - This town is small enough. You can't take a shit without someone knowing. There are people selling, but I can tell you that he ain't. - The question is whether I believe you. - You got no reason not to. But I guess that doesn't matter. You're gonna believe what you want. I don't need anything from you anymore, Cotton. That's all that matters. - Yeah what if I need something from you? No, no, no, just 'cause you're getting your pills from your brother don't mean you're gonna quit. Are you sucking his dick for him like you do mine? You sucking somebody else's? Now here's the way it's going to go. You got two choices. Now you can take this. Now you can take it in an ass beatin'. What you want, Raylene? Which way you want it? Raylene, there you go. You know I like it right here. Right there, yeah that's it. That's it. Yeah, that's it. That's it. That's it, yeah. Yeah, you like it like that, yeah. - You ever gone too far out in the river where the water's too deep? The current's so strong that you can't fight it and you feel yourself breaking free from the rocks underneath your feet? And before you know it, you're being swept away. You're no longer in control, darlin'. Right then you belong to the river, and you're gonna drown. Don't worry, darlin'. I still have my feet. - Say Cotton. - Waylon, here you now. - I just need to get high. - Really? - Yeah. - Sit down. Sit down. Not there, that's mine. Sit down somewhere else. Hey bro, you want a beer? - No, I'm good. - In case you change your mind. What you lookin' for? - A couple 80s. - I ain't got no 80s. Nobody got 80s. I got 60s. - Yeah, how much you want? - $30 a pill. - I'll take 'em. I'll pay you tomorrow. - Get the fuck out. - Come on, you know I'm good for it. - You and everybody else. - Have I ever not been? - No more store credit. - I get paid tomorrow. - You've got some fuckin' balls, man, you know that? I heard you might be selling. You buying else when you come back in here sick needing pills and ask for store credit. - Cotton, come on. Come on, I'll give you 100 tomorrow. - You want two 60s? - Yeah, that's why I came. That's why I'm here. - I'll give you two 60s. - Yeah, cool brother. I'll be here as soon as I'm done working tomorrow. I'll be here. - If you suck my dick, I'll give you them two 60s. I'm gonna start treating you like all the other crying whores come in here. You suck my dick, I'll give you a pill. - I ain't sucking your dick. - Really? Got your two 60s right here. Here they are. - Four. - Four? - All right. Four 60s. Ain't nobody gonna be the wiser. Come on, brother. Come on. Pay up right now. That's it. That's it, come on. - You shoot at me, you piece of shit? You stay the fuck away from Raylene. Everything is gonna be all right. Cotton can't say a word. He ain't gonna say a word. If anyone asks you, you never said a word to me about what happened last night. Do you understand? Nothing. I went over there to get pills, and he shot at me. That's what happened. - I've turned on myself. When he raped me, I came. - Appreciate it boss. - Hey man, I heard he broke his jaw, bust his cheek, burst his eardrum. Cotton's gonna kill someone. - You know he will. - They know who did it too. That's what I heard. - Yeah, you know who else knows, Cotton. I guarantee he's gonna take care of it by himself. - He's not pressing charges on him. - Tell you what I sure as hell wouldn't want to be on the biting end of that snake. - Sounds like to me Cotton oughta watch his ass. If somebody wanted him dead, he'd be blowing smoke rings out the back of his head. - Okay Waylon, get on inside. - Man, oughta snap your head. - It's okay Jimmy. I ain't mad, bud. I've been waiting for it to happen. It's all right. - Don't come to work tomorrow. Waylon. - It's my fault, bud. I'm sorry for making you have to do it. - I just want you to take some time. - What do you mean take time? - I spoke with the bosses, and everyone's agreed that you have had one heck of a bad year. I mean this is enough to kill everyone here including myself. They're giving you full medical benefits, and you're still getting your pay. You need help, brother, so go get it. - I don't know what to say. - I know. Not a day goes by I don't think about Justine. You know I loved her like she were one of my own. I don't know what I would've done. - Thank you, Jimmy. - Okay now. - Thanks for keeping up her grave. - There's around 500, 600 missing. She was skimming. - You know for sure it was her? - Yeah Mrs. Skool had a couple of cameras there. The books were off a little bit over a longer period, so she put 'em up. - Let me ask you something? Is there anything else on those tapes? Come on I've known you my whole life, and? - Yeah, it's all there. - Can he go away for that? - Raylene said it was consensual. - What about bail? - Not until she's been arraigned. - All right, thanks Dave. - Transport'll be here in about 10 minutes for Raylene. We'll bring her out the side. - I appreciate you. - You just can't touch her, Waylon. - What are you doing here? - You okay? - Yeah. - I'll be down to bail you out as soon as its set. - Don't. - No, no, I'll get it figured out. - No Waylon, I won't leave if you do. It's better for me in here. They said first offense, I go straight to treatment. I can't do this anymore. You've lost two girls, and it'll all go to waste if you get lost too. - Raylene, we gotta go. - All right. I love you. - I love you. Be careful, all right. - What you doin'? - Waiting for it to get dark. - Yeah. We found a place. We'll take you there now. Take you up to the hospital, get you something to get us there. - Dad, I ain't goin' to no rehab. I can't do it. - You can't keep doing this. I buried a grandbaby. I can't bury another. You're supposed to bury me. But this won't work unless you want it to. I ain't no good at talking, never have been. And I'm payin' that price. You're supposed to learn, be better for it. Be better than me. Go for a walk along the river. You've got a strong mind. Get it back. Make things right. - Drink this. Come on. - Hi. - You're real. - How you feelin'? - I think I'm gonna make it. Thank you, baby. - I know it wasn't just all you. I messed up. - It's all right? - I can't work on us until I work on me, you know? I'm gonna need some time. I would never ask you to wait for me, but I hope you do. - I'm not going anywhere, darlin'. - I'm not gonna have another family. It's only you. It's always just you. You know that, right? - Um - I love you. - I love you so much, baby.
