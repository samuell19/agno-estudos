Welcome. Welcome. And this is Osman, huh? He's a big man now! Let's go. What's this? It's a ship. We're getting on it. That is Bosphorus. There is Üsküdar. Galata. Big city. And this is only the tenth of it. İstanbul is a a sea of people. Welcome, son. Welcome, welcome. Praise the God. This is little Osman. You've grown so much. These are Hasan and Hüseyin. I couldn't have recognized. It's been 6 years. They were this little when we left our hometown. Let's go in. We'll go see father at the store. Father. Oh, so you've arrived. You've arrived, good. Veli! - Welcome. - Thanks. When did you arrive? Just now. You? It's been 5 years since me and my wife are here. You'll stay with your father, eh? Good, good. See you around. Now goodbye. Say hello to your wife. Didn't you recognize İbrahim of Yerköylü? I did, but... But what? Fellow townsmen must support each other in a foreign city, but... ...he doesn't deserve it. He allows his wife to work in a factory. Isn't that something! Another part of the city. We'll open the new store there. Big city. Even bigger. We were at a loss when we first arrived. 46,500. You undersold it. They knew I was leaving. Kiroglu insisted on the price. Kiroglu, huh? And he casually sends his respects. Whatever. Let Yozgat be his altogether. We are done with there. What? It's our hometown! We have many relatives there. We shouldn't have sold everything. Oh, my. You always complain. The saying goes, "You must keep your goods close to you." Now that we are living in İstanbul, our possessions must be here. You just rent this new store, no matter what. Money has to be invested, or it rots away. He insists on 50,000. Says that Blacksea brothers also want it. I asked around. They don't. He just wants to pit you two against each other. Keep forcing him. Or we'll be stuck with this little store. By the way, you have to prepare 20 cans of pickles, for an order. What now! You are still frowning! Here is your elder son Hıdır, younger son Veli. Elder daughter-in-law Naciye, younger one Meryem. Grandsons around you. I, Yozgat's renowned tradesman Hacı İlyas, am here! Moreover, with 2 stores, one at the edge, now one at the center of big İstanbul... ...we're willing to get to work! Instead of frowning, let's pray, roll up our sleeves and reach prosperity. God, give us strength! We're home. Will you feel homesick? Away from your mother, brothers... My place is right by your side. And near my son. Will you get used to here? Is this home different from there? Right. As long as you stay at home, the sky remains the same. I saw İbrahim of Yerköylü. They're here? But Hıdır snubbed him. He doesn't think highly of him. He lets his wife work in the factory. And that's bad? Hıdır thinks so. Is it shameful to work? Of course not. But, women has to stay at home. At home, sitting tightly. Even good-luck-charm did no good. I was told to take him to a doctor once we arrived İstanbul. He is a kid, it'll pass. Must be a little cold. Tell my mother. She's good at praying. That's how she nursed us back to health. Seems your room isn't enough. What's with those lustful glances in front of your father-in-law! Is this the new tradition, or because you've come to İstanbul now? İstanbul is out there. You'd better behave as if this yard is Yozgat! This hood is no different from our hometown. Here is not İstanbul but a typical Anatolian village. But a little mixed. People from south, Aegean region, Black Sea region, all together here. İstanbul lies out there. Once you rent the store there, no one can hold you back anymore. From this, you profit 5 here, 25 there. Here they buy in grams, while in there in kilograms. Now put those bottles on the shelves. Uncle İlyas. 250 grams olives, loaf of bread and pasta. - 250 grams? - Yep. Welcome. Thank you. Veli told me he'd seen İbrahim yesterday. Came to stay permanently? Yes. Come in, I'll make you coffee. No, thank you. I'm heading hospital, my back hurts a little. I took the day off. Wanted to see you on the way. After all, people miss their fellow townsmen. How nice of you. Come again. Daughter-in-law! Something has happened to Osman! Meryem, run over here! My child, my child... Give him to me so I can pray. Why did you take him away now! Now it'll pass, you'll be ok. He gets like this often? We had a good-luck charm made back in town. Did no good. They told us to get a doctor. Yes, you have to. Doctor?! This is a child. You don't go to a doctor for every whim! It seems you got used to "got touched" by strangers in the factory. Mom... Yes, my child. Tell your mother. Let's go out. Do you know this woman? Yes. Wife of İbrahim from back home. He was Veli's friend. Stop seeing her. She is not of our type. We know them as good people. That's trivial. They changed for the worse since they came here. Come. You heard what I said. Now go, help Naciye. He's playing the reluctant now. So we are faced with a weasel, huh... Is he willing to rent? What'd he get by not renting? He just wants the extra 10,000, that's all. It's not easy to swallow a piece of Hacı İlyas! We have to open the shop by Ramadan, no matter what. With the blessing of the Holy Month. Get it done. I sell open wine, after he leaves. Is he aware of this? Only God knows. Maybe he pretends not to know, or he really isn't aware. I've no idea. But it's quite profitable. Just by wine sales, I make the same money that he makes in a whole day. Has he ever wondered... Yeah, once he was about to ask. I said that sales usually increase towards evenings. Hey, what are you doing there? Putting the cans in order, grandpa. Oh, do it good then. Good, good. And what are you doing, little Osman, hmm? Nothing. He just forces me to wrestle. And why don't you? Pull him down like this. Can't you! I don't want to, grandpa! How does your mother feed you! Look at those skinny arms. Do you eat well? I do, grandpa! Eat well so that you will let him have it! Business is something else. Money flows between your fingers. It's not like farming. Veli. Kid had a seizure today. It's normal, he is a kid. Let mother pray a little. Didn't we already? You mustn't make a mistake giving back the change. Say, total cost is 435, and he gave 1000. First you give 15 back, and make it a round 450. Now, 50 back more, it is 500. 500 more, and it is 1000. Perfect. He tore his chest. Fluttered like a bird. Must be the change of place, it'll pass. Now, another thing... When someone asks for a currently unavailable goods... ...you don't say "We don't have it". Then the customer doesn't come back. If only I hadn't chosen to be a farmer first. Güler came today. Güler? Wife of İbrahim. Here? Well, my mother... She fumed about taking Osman to a doctor. Taking Osman to a doctor? My mother raised us without doctors. Don't worry. When we open the new store, then you'll see. A big store in the center of İstanbul sounds like a fairytale, but... ...it'll happen God willing. Grandma! Osman fell! So what? He became like yesterday. Where's he?! Factory woman took him. Who? Let's go! Hey, cover up, wear something!! My god, she's nuts! So what happened? He just collapsed while playing. I hope you aren't angry at me taking him. Why would I? God bless you. No, let him sit a little. Sit there. You'd settled good. It's been 5 years, but not settled here. We'll leave in a year. Back to hometown? No. We'll buy and move into our own home. No kids? Home first, then we'll think about it. I better go. Otherwise they'll pester me about where I've been. Meryem, you better take him to a doctor. Doctor gave me 3 days off yesterday. Tomorrow I'm free. Let me take you. They won't let me. Don't ask them. Take the kid and come. I want to but... Talk to your husband. He'd understand, right? Veli... Which hellhole did you enter? Did İstanbul make you horny in two days? Which stranger saw you like this, uncovered? Did you go to that woman? I told you to not see her. Don't you listen to your elders? I'll tell all this to Veli, he'll stomp you good! Rubberband is there, Uncle Veli. Measure it from there. Hello there. Got used to it? I help, dad. Good, run off home now. My daily wage? Rented the store? He's willing but playing the reluctant. Good, seems like you got used easily. When we rent the new store... ...see me then. Things are different there. Nothing like here. But if business click, money flows then. What if he won't agree? That store belongs to us. We'll get it either nicely or by force! What kind of man you think your elder brother Hıdır is, huh? Prepare dinner. He nearly returns from the mosque. She is a tough nut. Seems hard to subdue. Where are you off to now? Wanted to check on Osman. I said they'd nearly be home now! Under this roof you'd better not act as you please, daughter-in-law! Look what pharmacist gave me for my knee pain! You'll rub my knees good. Dinner ready? Clean the table, prepare the coffee. Come, rub my knees good. What's that? Pharmacist gave it for my knees. Mother's prayers didn't work? Maybe she got old. Look at him, talking as if he stayed young. Give me your knees. My prayers keep you walking. So the weasel didn't show up today? Doesn't matter, dad. That store will be ours. Yes, I know, but before Ramadan... Everything's ready. I got the fridge. I ordered steel shelves. Already done deals with retailers, can-sellers, beverage-sellers. Now it's just left to load them. How'd we afford all this? The name of "Hacı İlyas" clears every obstacle, dad. Yes, Hacı İlyas. Hacı İlyas of Sorgun. We forgot who we were... You said it! We are not a family to rot away in a shabby store on the edge of İstanbul. Peel the vegetables. Wait for me for filling the cans. You go ahead, I'll be in a minute. Where to? I'll check on Osman. He's out playing. Come. Is he the patient? What's the problem? He has seizures from time to time, breathes hardly. Flutters like a bird. When does it happen? I cannot say. It has not a definite time. It happened yesterday. Sit him there, take off his clothes. Age? Six. Full name? Osman Sorgunlu. Place of birth? Yozgat. Took him to anyone before? Anyone? To a doctor? No. Dress him. Take this. Tell the nurse outside you need x-ray. Return to me with the x-ray. He's ok, right? You just return with the x-ray, then we'll see. What'd he say? I didn't understand. Gave me this. X-ray. They'll look inside him. How?? - Have your photo taken before? - Uh-huh. Similar. They'll take photos of his insides. Now what? Come and get the photo on Wednesday. Take it to the doctor. I work that day, but I'll drop you off here. They didn't say what's wrong with him. They'll say after the photo. - Not even pills. - They'll give pills too. But you have to come. They don't want x-ray for nothing. Oh, you're alive then! Thanks for leaving everything to me. Where were you? Osman... What about him? He's frail by nature. You had better given birth to a strong kid, like mines. I'm going to mosque, tell Hıdır. Ok, dad. Uncle Veli. I delivered it. - Ok, you may go. - My daily wage? Here. And this one's on me. Thanks but you'll bankrupt in this way, Uncle Veli. There's nothing free in business. I saw sister Meryem with Osman in the square. What kind of a man are you to let your woman on the streets? Didn't you beat some sense into her? How can she go somewhere without asking you? What about our honor!! Honor? What about it? Ask your woman. Where was she? It was me who sent her. You sent her into the bowels of İstanbul? With that slut? A good Muslim does not tarnish someone without being certain, mom. You'll only know motherhood when you suffer for your kids. I took Osman to a hospital. Güler helped me, God bless her. Without asking me. You wouldn't let me! No one cares for my son! He flutters like a bird during seizures! "It'll pass, he is a kid, must be a cold." Enough! Veli, something is wrong with our kid... They said so at the hospital? No. They'll tell on Wednesday. How can they know? My son is right as rain. Just under the weather, is all. He's my lion. - Dad. - What, my hawk? - You told me to take me to mountains. - Of course I will. - Will also you play the pipe? - Of course I will! I'll play a good song. - Will we pick flowers? - Won't we! From every color even! Mom... Lay me down. Take me to hospital on Wednesday. I can't do it, a woman all alone. Good. Now you know what you can do as a woman. Stay home, help my mother. Veli, don't. We have to know what's wrong with him. Impossible. I'm alone at the store on Wednesday. Dad and elder brother are going to see that renter guy. It'll be the confrontation day. Please, sit down. We want to reach a deal today. It'll be no problem, if that's what you want. There's a better offer. Look, sir. No one can take that store except us. If our offer isn't good enough, suit yourself. I'll bash the door down and take it. - By force, huh? - God no. Kid is sick. Tell me what he needs. I'll get every medicine. It's beyond medicine. Sit. He needs operation. Operation? Let me put it simply. He has a hole in his heart. His blood isn't getting refreshed enough. That's the reason of his seizures. You have anybody here? - He has his father. - Good. Tell him. You have money? Money? Listen my dear. This is a state hospital. Some check-ups cost nothing, but some treatments require money. And this operation costs 6000-7000 minimum, my dear. No luck without the operation? No, he wouldn't last more than 2-3 months. It's a birth defect. This is 10,000 short. That is the store's worth. Not one penny more. That store is ours. Sign. Where were you, my daughter-in law! Good news. We rented the store! Did you go to hospital without asking me! They said I'm ill, dad. You're ok, my lion. Isn't he? Take the kid inside. I'll be in a minute. Stop crying, tell what they said. He had a hole in his heart. He needs surgery. Hole? Ridiculous. He just doesn't eat well. I'll start feeding him so well that he'll be fit as a fiddle. You'll see. Stop this nonsense. Let's get to work. Instead of being a good wife and look after your kid... ...you're wandering in hospitals. My little Osman isn't ill. - This is another world. - It is. Now first thing is to get customers. - We'll undersell? - Don't know. They'll think cheap goods is bad. Have to run to their doorstep first thing in the morning... ...asking if they need anything. Many ways to convince them. We'll handle it, God willing. Don't dawdle. Dinner has to be prepared at home. - So, what's the total cost? - 135,000. - That much? - We'll pay every 15 days. It'll all be paid within a month. Just one month? What'd I tell you? Money will flow here. Pay your debt with sales. You'll even profit, mind you. - Then, another step. - Another? You'll see when the time comes. Daughter-in-law! I fed him good before. Now tell me, what's wrong with Osman? Doctor said he'd live 3 months most without the operation. Operation costs 6000-7000. My girl, they cut up people for no reason. We had a friend named Ali Ucmaz, they wanted to operate his kidneys.. He shooed them away. He is still alive and well. What's good crying? Cut it out. Nothing'll happen to him while we're here. We can't throw away 7000 while we're in debt now. Eat this. Be strong. Let me go! I don't want it! Mom! Congratulations. Good luck. Hang this up somewhere. Have the blessing of the prayer. It writes "God favors the victor." 1 kg cheese, 10 eggs, 2 loaves of bread, 5 packs of cigarettes to Huzur Apartment. 5 kg olive oil. 3 kg rice. 3 kg salami. Hacı İlyas should be going to mosque. I'll tend to the store. You go home. Come on in. Welcome. How's little Osman? They'd poured lead against evil eye. Now we're returning from a faith healer. Is Veli against operation? He listens only to his parents. There's the new store now. He even talks about it in his sleep. They only care about the new store. What'll it be then? I'll try to deal with it, by myself. Dear Ibrahim. Exchange these for money. When father died, my elder brother gave me these as my share of inheritance. This is all I have. Will it be enough? No idea. We'll exchange and see. We need to put salami and sausages there. These empty spaces should also be filled. We also need a cash register. It'll make things easier. With what money? We'll have to find a way. I'll be going now. Be back for closing. Here, father. Hope it helps, God willing! We're short 10,000. Ramadan starts tomorrow. Business will pick up. We'll clear the debt in no time. God willing! Hey, haven't you gone to bed yet! Come to my lap! Meryem! You give your jewellery, too. I sold them. - Without asking me? - For Osman. Osman? What about us? You all got "store fever"! My Osman is dying! And all you think is money!! Take your hands off of my son! What good is your praying! He is dying! She wasn't like this. You keep letting her see that factory girl Güler! Everything is because of her! She'll keep creating more fuss! That Güler seems like a shyster. If she was a relative, I'd already stomped her head! Still awake? Ok then. Please help them. Don't make us embarrassed. - Water? - Heating it. İstanbul is something else. Every corner is another paradise. There is gold to be found everywhere. The guy who turns everything to gold... ...died starving, since all of his food turned to gold. - What do you mean? - We got poorer since the new store. Now all we eat is rice. We don't need anyone. We'll get above water soon, God willing. Patience. Patience... I'm out of patience, Veli. Gotta have a solution for Osman. Meryem... I'd no intention to hit you but you embarrassed me in there. My parents aren't as bad as you think. He's still working on Sundays at his age. For himself? No, all for us! Will he deny a petty sum from Osman, from us? You behaved wrong, Meryem. Failed compared to Naciye. Embarrassed me. If I were you... - Mom, I'm cold. Liked the sea? - You promised to take me to mountains! - I will, my son. - Yozgat mountains? - Whichever you want. You stopped playing the flute for me. If only we hadn't come here... Then you wouldn't have slapped my mom either! Father, I behaved wrong. Chalk it up to my ignorance... ...a mother's concern for her kid. This is jewellery money. 2,000 short for the operation. Do as you wish. We are a family, daughter-in-law. Health of one of us concerns all of us. We care for our children, of course. But we are a little hard-pressed now. Let's wait 2 weeks, we'll see what happens. It is 17:43. Fast-breaking time for İstanbul. - We'll have it ready by next week. - Don't worry about it. - Anything you need? - Ask Hıdır. - So he hired the new store? - Yes. - Then close here and join him there. - Nooo! Here is different. Here's profit is different! Father... Another order for pickles. Prepare it with Naciye, my dear girl. Yes, but Osman isn't well.... He now suffocates even walking. You'd said 1 week, Ramadan is over. My girl... This new store swallows everything. Tomorrow is Eid. Once it's over, we'll breathe easier. Please, father. Ok, ok. Just prepare those pickles. Uncle Veli. Grandpa wants you to come to the store, urgent. You'll take her home. We haven't quite seen each other in this Ramadan... The store, the business... Yes, business... A business that grinds people. Business never stops, Meryem. You don't see even Osman. Osman will be fine. We're expanding the store. We need to be patient. You be patient. I won't leave Osman in your hands. You go to your store, where money flows between your fingers. - We'll pay in... - No! In the first day of Eid-Adha! Liked it? Be blessed. - Bought for me, grandpa? - No, this is sacrificial. What's that mean, grandpa? Come and listen. Once upon a time, there was Abraham and his son Ishmael. Abraham wanted to sacrifice him for God. His son?? Yes. To prove his loyalty to God, he took him to a mountain. Was the kid afraid? No. He accepted his fate. Just as Abraham was to kill him, God sent a ram from the skies! God said "You are a good believer, Abraham. I'm sparing your son." "Instead, sacrifice this ram." Thus, since those times rams are sacrificed in Eid-Adha. This ram is yours till Eid. Feed it well! He's the manager of the bank downtown. Told me to rent a store nearby. - How? - He offered to lend money. Said that we could sell fridge, radio, TV etc. - Well? - I say we go for it. - But with credit? - Debt drives the bold, they say. It seems that God favors us. I brought him here for you to see him. What can I say, my dear daughter-in-law. The store let me down. It swallows everything. And now it'll swallow us? God forbid! You take the kid home now, he better not catch cold. I have a payment tomorrow, but after that... ...everything is yours, my Osman's! Come on. You'll all be ok. - Take me around, mom. - Where, my dear? Wherever. Put this on. You need it, my dear. May you stay green like this forever. I know why you're crying. Because I'll die. No, my dear! You won't! I'll get you better! Will I be better until Eid-day? You will, my dear. Will my father get me in a car in Eid? You'll come too. I will. Never leave me, mommy. - Still up? - Waited for you. Something happened to Osman? No, he's sleeping. But it's sure he'll... - Cut it! How can you know! - Mothers just know. Veli, tell your father. We cannot wait any longer. I will tomorrow, after Eid prayer. We have a payment, after that we're in the clear. No! This store swallows everything. We'll all be its victims, Osman being the first! Then the next kid! - Next kid? - I'm pregnant. Why didn't you tell me before? Would it matter? All you see is the store! But for whom I work? All I have is you and Osman. Will it be also a babyboy? God knows. I'll tell you something. After you give birth... ...we'll have our separate house. What do you say? Osman must get better first. Leave the animal alone. Get my apron! You open the store. Kids want to buy things. Rub my knees with that medicine. I can barely walk. Father! Osman! Osman! My Osman... Fetch your Uncle Veli! You stay at the store! He's gone! Gone! My dear! My Osman! Let me go! Let me! Happy Eid Adha, Hacı İlyas! His grandfather! Happy Eid Adha! What's this tin can here? Honey has frozen, grandpa. I'm melting it. - So you'll outdo us all, huh? - Thanks to you, grandpa. - Can I leave? - Hmm. My daughter.. My daughter-in law.. Osman is dead, father. Another one is on the way. Here! I'll bring him up and sacrifice for you, too! All for your store! It was God's will, my girl. What could we do? How are your knees, father? The medicine helped a little.. So when it's your health, nothing against medicines, huh? What if I smash your head now? My dear girl, easy... These are your life! Nothing else matters! - Give my money back. - Ok, my dear girl. How much? My Osman's operation money! Ok, my girl. But, I have a paym- - Give it! - Wait. Come, sister. Any news? Don't worry. Where'd she disappear? What'd she do all alone, pregnant? This is a fight, Veli brother. Wheels started turning. No stopping now. This mill needs strength, bravery. You have to endure. And once in a while claims sacrifices, huh? Business knows no tears. If you don't commit to it, it'll end you. That's the way it is. - Hıdır brothe- - Cut it! - Where is Meryem? - Meryem? Yes. What could she do all alone if not for you or your wife! Spill it! This is a matter of honor! Took her to a female friend. So this is your townsmanship, huh? I don't care about any townsmanship. All I care is kindness! What's she doing there for 10 days! Is she returning to hometown? No. We helped her a little. She's working in the factory. Factory?! What's done is done. Everything is God's will. Possessions can be lost in flood, fire... People can die, suffer, or prosper... But honor is a different matter. Your woman is working in this factory. This cannot be accepted! Do what you must. Be a man! Don't let your hand tremble! Is there a job for me too in the factory...
