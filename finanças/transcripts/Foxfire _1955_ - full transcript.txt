Foxfire. Deep in the night it haunts me so is it to always be memory for me of love that I used to know. I watch the foxfire gleam where has it gone my broken dream. Lost in the glow of night love that seemed so right wait. Waiting, waiting. And I yearn. Yearning, yearning. While the foxfire burns in my heart. I wait and I yearn while the foxfire burns. In my heart. Hi. Can I borrow your jack? Me no Jack. No, no. Uh, a-a jack. Jack to fix a tire. No got no jack. Don't be silly. Everybody's got a jack. What if you had a flat tire? You got jack? No. Well, we no got jack. What's the diff? Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute! I can go with you! You can drop me off! Hi. Is that your station wagon back there? Yeah. Do you mind giving me a lift to La Paz? We'll fix the tire for you. Oh, no. Let them bother. It's too hot. But thanks. Uh... Move, will you, Hugh? Oh, I don't mind sitting in the backseat. Would you like a drink? Oh, lay off it. Look, uh, if you fellows have been celebrating this morning... I mean, it's not that I'm prudish. I just enjoy living. With your equipment, you should. He's all right when he's sober. Get in, will you, please? Well, if you say so. Hope I'm not taking you boys out of your way. I've never been in Arizona before. My mother has asthma, so we came out for a couple of weeks. I like it here. Are you... you sure you won't have a drink? Hey, who are you trying to impress? I said lay off it. He's a masterful type... Strong, silent and masterful. Does-Doesn't he remind you of a Saint Bernard? Huh? He came into town this morning to rescue me. I've been lost three days. And they couldn't get along without me on the job. Where do you boys work? At the Tyson Copper Mine in Lodestone. Oh. Ever hear of it? No. Well, Lodestone's been a ghost town for 50 years. Now, he-he thinks he's gonna change all that. Right, Dart? Right? Hmm? Is that your name? Dart? Jonathan Dartland. What do you do at the mine? Engineer. I'm the doctor... Hugh Slater. How do you do? The doctor? Yeah. Come over and see me. I'll show you my diplomas. What's your name? Amanda Lawrence. Ah. Amanda Lawrence. What kind of Indians are those? Apaches. Mescalero tribe. Boy, they're really stupid. I tried to get them to give me a lift, and they didn't even know what I was talking about. You're speaking of the people we love. Yeah? Well, they give me the creeps. I used to be crazy about Indians when I was a kid. All those movies I saw. I was gonna devote my life to them. Well, I'm glad I got over that. What does it mean when Indians do this? It means you're crazy. Well, maybe so. Well, I'm sorry this is over so fast. Why don't you two stay for lunch? Delighted. No, we have to get back. To the wife and kiddies? No, we just have to get back. Well, listen. Mom's giving a dinner party tonight, and we'd love to have you. Charmed, I'm sure. Are we dressing? Well, it's nice of you, but... Please. Things have been awfully dull up to now. - All right. We'll try. - Good. 8:00. And don't be late. Mom's sort of a pain that way. We'll be there! So long, Mandy! Don't forget... 8:00! And thanks for the lift! Wow! That's a lot of woman. Hey, why didn't you tell her you were half Apache? What difference does it make? Are you sure he didn't have another date? He's a very unsociable guy. He's afraid of dames... crazy fella! Well, what exactly did he say? Well, there was trouble at the mine. He couldn't get away. He couldn't but you could? Don't they ever have anyone sick over there? Well, I have a very able-bodied nurse who takes care of things. Extremely able-bodied. Not as able-bodied as you though. You're a beautiful dancer. Do you do other things as well as you dance? Excuse me. Mr. Dartland? Mr. Dartland? You're not leaving? I, uh... I didn't see you in there. I'm sorry I'm so late. That's all right. There was trouble at the mine. Serious trouble? Oh, it could have been. I bet you fixed it good. Well, better late than never. You, uh, look very pretty. Thank you. So do you. Shall we go in? Oh, uh... Do we have to? There are so many people in there I don't know. The doctor told me you were shy. Oh, about some things... Parties, people, mothers. Mine's perfectly harmless. None of them are. Well, would you rather walk and talk for a while? That's more like what I had in mind. You know, for a slow starter, you do all right. Now would you like to tell me the real reason you were late tonight? It wasn't trouble at the mine. No. No, I almost didn't come at all. I happened to pick up a Tucson paper... that article about your mother. Why didn't you tell me she owned the New York Daily Record? What's that got to do with anything? Oh, it explains a lot about you... Rich, beautiful, probably spoiled. So? So... what I mean is, what's a guy like me walking around with a girl like you for? Well, uh, would you like to stand still and find out? Well. Did you have any idea that this would happen this afternoon? I know I wanted it to. I was afraid I didn't have a chance. See how wrong you can be. Where are you from? I... I was born near here. I guess I've lived all over. For example? Well, I went to college in Massachusetts. I've worked in Syria, Peru, Venezuela. All the other places don't seem very important now. But Arizona's home, huh? I keep coming back. Got a family? No, not exactly. All alone in the world. No, my mother's still alive. She lives on the Apache reservation near here. Her name's Saba. She's an Indian. An Indian. I'm half Apache. My father came out from Boston for his health. Saba was his servant. Later he married her. I'm sorry for what I said this afternoon. That's all right. No, really. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I said it's all right. I don't have any feelings about it. Tell me about... about you. You life must be much more interesting. No, it hasn't been. But I think it could be. How about the second section? What's the lead on that? Put his column on the second page. Better check our contract with him first. Just a minute, Barkley. Amanda, darling, do you realize it's daylight? Mom, if you've got a shotgun, you can use it now. Shotgun? What are you... You're gonna love him too. What are you trying to tell me? Have we got any Indians in the family? Indians? Are you drunk? 'Cause if we haven't, we're going to have some soon. Barkley, Amanda's lost her reason out here. Must be too much oxygen in the Arizona air. I'll call you back later. Amanda, I'll talk to you now, dear. What was it you said about Indians? Oh, I was only teasing. He's just a little part Indian, that's all. Oh, he's so pretty. Wait till you see him. Well, I certainly hope I do before you do anything foolish. You'll get a chance to, 'cause he'll be back. Oh, I'll tell you all about him tomorrow, Mother. His father was a professor, and his mother lives on an Indian reservation. Operator. Get me the desk. His mother lives on an Indian reservation? Yes? Hello, this is Mrs. Lawrence. I want two seats on the late afternoon plane for New York. Thank you. Pardon me. Can you tell me where Jonathan Dartland lives? Uh, Dartland? Yes. Ooh, uh, yeah. You see that silver-colored house up there? Yes. Well, that ain't it. It-It's the one next to it with the red trimming. Now, you go up around this bend and you veer off to the left. Take your first turn right, up around the hill... and that'll bring you slap-dab in front of the house. All right. I think I'll find it. Thanks. Dart? Dart? Dart? Hey. What are you doing here? I was coming to see you. I tried to call you... Darling. But the telephones are... I know all about the phones. Will you marry me? What? Don't answer me now. I'll give you an hour to think it over. Are you always this crazy? No, what I really meant to say was, will you marry me tomorrow? You're beautiful. So are you. If I thought it'd work, I'd ask you, but... we haven't a chance. Why, you don't know what it is to be a... a miner's wife. Well, here. Look... Look around you. Um... Maybe now you... You think it's all right. But later you'd hate it. You'll hate me. No, it'll work. I've never felt this way before. I know it'll work. I just don't get it. I must have failed somewhere. How you could even dream of living in this godforsaken town. This awful shack. When you meet him, you'll understand everything. - Mandy, you ready? - Everybody's here. Just a minute, darling. Now, Mother, there he is. Be nice to him. You look even more beautiful. So do you. Oh. Mother, this is Dart. Hello, Mrs. Lawrence. Son. I guess this must have been a shock to you. I'm still reeling from the blow, but let's say I'm making an effort. Shall we go? Mmm. What a pretty bride. Uh, this is, uh, Mrs. Mablett. How do you do? A-And my boss, Jim Mablett. Mr. Mablett. How do you do? Hugh you know. Yeah, but I don't know what happened. I guess I fell asleep along the road someplace. Good luck, Mandy. Thanks, Hugh. Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Foley. Hello. Hello. Mr. and Mrs. Riley. How do you do? And this is Mr. and Mrs. Potter. They run our general store. How do you do? Welcome and good luck. Thank you. This is my cousin... Uh, his English name is Walt Whitman. How do you do? This is my mother, Mrs. Lawrence. How do you do? Thank you. Very well. And my good friend, the Reverend Barton from the reservation. Reverend, it was good of you to come. How do you do? Um, honey, isn't your mother here? No, she didn't... Uh, she couldn't come. Saba never leaves the reservation. She regrets that she couldn't join us, but she sends you greetings. Well, thank you. Well, uh... Uh, I hope I won't be rushing you if we get started right away. You won't be rushing us at all. Will you please take her right hand in yours? Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Therefore, if any man can show any just cause why they may not be lawfully joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace. It's an earthquake! Is it an earthquake? We dynamite every day at noon. Oh. The ring, please. Dart, get the phone. All right, all right. I'll answer you as soon as I can find you. Good morning. Ohh. Mrs. Mablett. I'm not even dressed. No standing on ceremony for me. Oh! You're not dressed, are you? At 10:00 in the morning, I certainly thought... Is it 10:00 already? This isn't a good way to begin life here. I think the right start is so important, especially with so difficult a man as Mr. Dartland. Difficult? Oh, you know... the Apache reputation for being so cruel and dangerous. I think you're very brave to marry him. You're quite a tease. Of course, Mr. Dartland has many fine qualities. Except, as my husband always says, "Once an Indian, always an Indian." Mr. Dartland's mother proved that. She did? Living all those years with that remarkable Professor Dartland, that refined and cultured man. And the minute he dies, running back to living like a savage... on that horrible reservation. Oh. Well, maybe she was happier there. Naturally. They can never rise above their background. That's their trouble. I tell you, I've seen it happen a thousand times. My dear! You didn't let your husband go off without his lunch? Oh. Is that what that is? A hot, nourishing lunch is so important... for men who are underground a lot. Ew! Some lunch.- Don't you know it'll come right up again? You'll never get rid of those around here. You haven't met the pied piperess of Hamlin. No, Mrs. Mablett. I think I'm going to manage very well. Perhaps you will. You're young and hardy. But your husband doesn't seem to be able to. He never gets along anywhere. He's had opportunity after opportunity. You know, Mrs. Mablett, I think I'd like to learn about it all by myself. All right. But you'll never learn anything from him. They're tight-mouthed too. They keep everything to themselves. But it's your marriage. I was only trying to suggest... It was nice of you to stop by. I really do wish you luck, dear. Thank you. Where does the blushing bride think she's going... with that lunch pail? Hey! Hi! Good morning! Well... Don't tell me this is the Johns Hopkins of Lodestone. I'm still gonna show you those diplomas. Don't you think it's a little late for that? Not me. I don't give up. Oh. This is Maria Conchera, our nurse, Mrs. Dartland. How do you do? The doctor told me how able... how able you are. Well, won't you come in? Oh, no, thanks. Just taking this lunch down to my husband. Bye. Good-bye. See you later. I didn't know you two knew each other so well. We don't yet. But we might someday. You better not let Dart hear you talk like that. He'd think I was kidding. Don't count on it. I know Dart better than you do. I always suspected you did. Not that way. Dart and I just understand each other, that's all. Well, we should have fun going around together, the four of us. Now don't get any ideas. Marriage isn't a communicable disease. - Hi. - Hi. Is this the shortcut to the mine? No. It's the long way home. Oh. Thanks. Hey. We saw you getting married yesterday. Tell Dart Rose and Cleo said congratulations. Rose and Cleo? Right. I'll do that. We should have told her not to go to the mine. Why? Let her find out for herself. Anybody home? Hi. Where is everybody? "One bell, stop. Two bells, lower men." Hmm. - Okay. - Fire in the hole! All clear! Is Mr. Dartland here? Get him out of here! You all right? Yeah. Great. Hi, honey! What are you doing here? Did you see what happened? What? We almost had an accident. That's my fault? It is as far as the Indians are concerned. They think a woman's a jinx below ground. Well, that's a pretty silly superstition. Well, that's the way they are! Stay away from here. Here's your hot, nourishing lunch. I hope you choke on it. Amanda! Wait! Hey, did we just get married? 'Cause if we didn't, we should. And I don't like tears. You don't? They make me feel better. Don't ever cry, not with me. Hey. Y-You better go. I... I don't get along with Mablett too well as it is. You didn't tell me you had any trouble with Mablett. Lots of things I haven't had time to tell you. Including you love me. I'll get around to that someday too. Go on. Oh, uh, thanks for my lunch. Okay. Oh, by the way, Rose and Cleo sent you their best. See you tonight. Hi. So, he found out the truth about you, huh? You can't cook. Oh, it's not me. It's the stove. I'll prove it to you as soon as we get it fixed. I accept the invitation. Oh, you too, Maria, of course. Thank you. Night. That's the first social invitation I ever had in this town. Honey, let's sit down a minute. It's cool out here. What did she mean by that? Who? Maria. Why doesn't she get invited out? It's not important. Come on. Tell me. She's a half-breed. That's ridiculous. Those things don't matter anymore. But they do. Ask Mablett. That's why he resents me. Darling, if you don't get along with Mablett, why don't you get a job somewhere else? Anybody'd hire you. Well, look at me. You mind your business, and I'll mind mine. But I thought mine was yours, and yours was mine. What is mine? Don't you know? Oh, come on now. The teasing's over. I want to talk. For a minute? Okay. For a minute. All right. Why do we live here? Look over there. What's that? Foxfire. Hmm? Foxfire. It's the phosphorescent glow that comes from rotting timbers. It only shows in the moonlight. It looks like a million fireflies. It's an old abandoned shaft. As kid, I used to wander through it. I dreamed of someday finding gold there. I will too. Gold? There's a vein in that mountain. I'll prove it. Well, Mother will be delighted that I married a millionaire. You won't, I suppose? No. Don't do it for me. I've got everything I need right now. Oh, it's-it's more than that. It's doing something big, something worthwhile. The thrill of bringing new life where there's so much desolation. Well, that I approve. I'll do it too... If I can get around Mablett. Why is Mablett against it? Do you always ask so many questions? Not, but, honey, if Mablett's against it, Mother's always looking for new investments. Keep your mother out of it. I'll handle it myself. Tyson will be here soon, and if I can convince him, I won't have to worry about Mablett. You bring Tyson home to me, and I'll convince him. You'll what? Well, I'm only trying to help. I don't need that kind of help. Honey, that foxfire's pretty. I'd like to see it closer. Can we walk over there? It's dangerous. Is there a superstition about women there too? I'm sorry about this morning. Don't throw me out again. Don't come so close then. Minute's up. Hammer, nails, garden hose, cement, weed killer, floor wax, stove polish, varnish, mop, broom, D.D.T. and a lunch bucket. I guess that's all, Mrs. Potter. Oh. Where can I order a telephone? They're not easy to get. The nearest phone office is in Globe. Oh. Well, thanks. Do you want to charge it? Mm-hmm. Hi, Hugh. Hello, Mandy. Say, can I borrow some of your manly strength to help me up the hill with this? You sure can, as soon as I get some tobacco. Hello, Mrs. Potter. Hi, Doc. How would you, uh... How would you like to go hunting with me later? No, thanks. I've got some hunting of my own... insects. And it's going very well too. Hey, you wouldn't like to help me paint, would you? Oh, I might be persuaded. Ah, there's a dear boy. Thanks, Mrs. Potter. Bye, Mrs. Mablett. Good-bye. She's certainly a friendly type. Hmm. Thinks she knows it all. Wouldn't be surprised if she did. I don't know, I just can't seem to warm up to that Mrs. Mablett. Or vice-versa. The whole town stinks. Why do you bother? Why do you stay here? I'm not so conscious of my shakes, with that dynamiting every day. No, seriously. Oh, it's not much of a story. Back east I had a good practice and a good wife... I thought. The trouble was, she was practicing on the practice. I found out and pulled out. She finally legalized it with the richest patient I had. Is that why you drink? It's as good an excuse as any. It's too bad. 'Cause, you know, Dart's right. You're very nice when you're sober. Thank you, Mrs. Dartland. But experts have tried to reform me. I might give you a chance at it though. Hi, Rose, Cleo. Hi. Hi. How come you know them? Oh, they're just friends of my husband's. Yeah, Mom. The dump really looks adorable now. Well, I spent two months on it. Of course, I don't have any fingernails left, and my skin is permanently paint-spattered, but... Yeah. Oh, how is New York? No, it's hot here... roasting. Yeah. Oh, hey, we have a new phone now, so you can call us. Of course I had to tell them I was having a baby to get it, but... No, no, Mom. I was just kidding. Sure, I'd let you know. Don't worry. I just told them that. I'd tell you. You first, of course. You want to talk to her? Well, all right, Mom. You call us, huh? Okay. Bye. She finally said she was gonna give us a wedding present. What was that about a baby? I said I'd tell you first. We have each other. That's enough. Well, yes, for now, but... All right. Let's just live for now. Dart, you don't want any children? Are you still daydreaming about us? When the novelty wears off, we'll be able to break it up without any complications. "Break it up"? "Novelty"? Well, sure. That's all it can be to you... Your broken fingernails, this crummy town, nothing to do but housework. Honey, don't feel like that. I was only joking. Well, I'm a realist. Maybe it won't happen, but if it does, I... All right. I take it all back. Now come on and help me with the dishes. Dart, what's wrong? Oh, honey, I love my dishpan hands. If you want to know, I'm jealous of your rotten old mine... Give that to me. I... Day in and day out. Ooh! You leave that miserable locker there purposely just so I'll kill myself! Will you let me clear it out and get rid of it? I'll get around to it one of these days. It's probably filled with old love letters. I knocked. You usually make it in time for dinner. I was still at the cocktail hour. What's the matter, he been treating you badly? Just a little discussion. Well, next time you stay on your feet. You'll get a draw. How about a drink? Sure. Here. Let me give you a hand with those. Thanks, Hugh. You wash. I want to save my hands for surgery. What's the matter? Nothing. I just felt dizzy for a minute. There's a doctor in the house for things like that. Must have been that spill I took in the other room. Will you get the rest of the dishes off the table? I'll be over at Mablett's. Hi, Mrs. Kelly. Please, Miss. You've got to let Susan see the doctor. What did she do? Meet some mangy coyote up in those hills? Well, I was always careful. She never got away from me before. That's why I'm worried. Her first litter at her age. Oh, please, miss. Well, he's not a dog doctor yet, but I'll speak to him. Who else has something serious? Well, good morning, Mrs. Dartland. We haven't had this pleasure before. Is this a professional call? I'd like to see the doctor. Sit down and take your turn. He's in the lab now. Just be patient, patients. Whew! Heat's terrible, ain't it? Poor little thing. She feels it awful. She's gonna have puppies. Isn't she brave? Never a complaint, even when she feels nausea. Oh, dogs do, you know. Just like women. But she keeps it all to herself. Hardly a whimper out of her. I wonder what kind they're gonna be... and how many. Do you think she'll suffer much? Will you please tell the nurse that I'll be back another time? Yes, ma'am. How are we doing for patients? Not too many. Good. Then I can still get away this afternoon. Hugh, take me with you today. Your idea of hunting bores me. It didn't use to. Well, we were just getting acquainted. We can pretend we just met. What's skulking beneath that pretty hair of yours, Maria? Your new girlfriend's in the waiting room. And who is my new girlfriend? Don't think I don't know what's going on. What surprises me is that Dartland hasn't found out. You know, Maria, you're far too attractive a girl to be so jealous. Will you see Susan now, Doctor? I'll get to all of you. Where's Mrs. Dartland? She said she'd come back. It's not polite to yell. I'll see those patients now. Look, Mr. Tyson. Let me try to explain it to you this way. Here's the old Miller shaft. Fifty years ago, he drove drifts north and south, trying to reach the old vein. He failed. So? Well, I believe that the Indian vein is at this level. And we can reach it by tunneling in this direction. You just whisper at that old shaft, and it'll fall apart. We rebuild it. Well, what do you think this project will cost, Dartland? Between 90,000 and 100,000. That's just another one of his wild Apache pipe dreams. We couldn't even begin to buy the drilling equipment for that. We don't buy equipment. We don't? Daytime, we use our equipment at Tyson Copper. Nights, we use it here. Oh, I can just see us... dragging those heavy water liners over here every night. We don't use water liners. We dig dry with jackhammers. Uh-uh. There's a law against raising rock dust in Arizona. Mr. Tyson, when we're a thousand feet below ground, we make our own laws. What do we use for men at night? Indians. Knowing you, I'm surprised you didn't say we'd use the same men in both mines. Some of them we'll have to... the blasters and the other specialists. They'll be glad of the extra dough. I've even worked it out using the same power lines. Hey, Dartland, your wife phoned an hour ago. Wants you to meet her up on the hill. It's almost time. - Wants me to what? For a picnic. She says she fixed something good. Call her back. Tell her I can't. Well, it's almost lunchtime, isn't it? You go on to your picnic. Mr. Tyson, I wanted to explain these details to you. Dart! There she is now. She can wait. What for? We can talk this over tonight at Mablett's party, hmm? Want to have some lunch, Mablett? Yeah. Excuse me, Dart. Hi, honey. Whoa, you're puffing. Better go into training. Picnic, today of all days. Why did you do this to me? I was having a conference with Tyson. I thought it was about time we had a little conference ourselves. I could be wrong. Conference about what? What's so important it couldn't wait? Nothing. I wanted to see you. I get lonesome sometimes. Okay. What did you bring to eat? The main thing about a picnic is the mood, and that's spoiled. I'll see you later, okay? It's the most fascinating thing you can ever imagine. Not only was Tanosay an actual warring chief, but he was also a medicine man, called a shaman. And here is his all-powerful prayer pouch. Wait till you see what's in it. Four eagle feathers. Four is the sacred Apache number. And here's a bit of a horn from a white-tailed deer. Very mystical. He used to cure people with this stuff. I could use that pouch at the hospital. You could! You could! Do you know what Dart's name is in Apache? No. Pahkahnachi. Isn't that wonderful? Honestly, it's the most exciting article I've ever read. You've gotta read it. Hi, darling. You better hurry. The Mabletts are expecting us at 8:00. Why don't you two go on without me? I don't want to spoil your fun. Oh, please, Dart. Put those things back. Well, that's pretty dull. I don't know. It just doesn't seem to be my day. I seem to be packing up all the time. Hugh, would you mind waiting outside for us? Sure. I don't need any help. Darling, I opened the footlocker because I don't like secrets. I'm sorry. You seem to have a few of your own. Now, what does that mean? Someday I'm gonna knock Hugh's block off. Well, you'd be wrong. Hugh's the one friend I've got in this town. But if you feel that way about it, we won't have him here anymore. How old were you when your father died? Why? Well, those pictures, they only show you as a little boy. He died when I was seven. And you were raised on the reservation? Yep. When are you gonna take me to meet your mother? She's beautiful. And your grandfather. Why didn't you tell me he was a famous chief? You mean his royal blood makes me more acceptable? You know, you try to pretend like you're not touchy on that subject, but you certainly are. Lay off it, will you, Amanda? Darling, you're nervous about meeting Tyson tonight. Don't be. It's gonna be all right. Look, this is the first time we've ever been out together. Let's try to have a good time, huh? You look very pretty. So do you. Now come on. We're gonna be late. Intriguing old house, isn't it? Yes, very. Only real house in town. It's Victorian Rococo. Oh. I know. People think I look like a chipmunk with a walnut in each cheek. Oh, not at all. They're just muscles. As a kid, I used to get mad all the time, like this. I see. Want to feel 'em? Oh, no. I think I'll just take your word for it. I'll go over your figures and let you know. I hope I'm not interrupting anything, but, uh, would you dance with me, Mr. Tyson? I'm not much of a dancer. Oh, I'd love to teach you. Amanda. Excuse us, gentlemen. What does your wife think about your dream of gold, Dartland? Amanda doesn't know anything about mining. Regardless of what she knows, in all my years of mining, I've never tackled a project without Mrs. Mablett's knowledge and approval. I'm sure she's helped you quite a lot. Well, at least we're still together. You know, when a woman doesn't have her husband's work to be interested in, she sometimes becomes interested in his friends. At least that's the talk around town. You know, to tell you the truth, I wanted to talk to you too. Talk and dance? I can't. Let's settle for a drink. All right. This is better. Mmm. Thank you. You don't seem very excited about my husband's gold mine. Well, Mablett and I are against it because there's so little proof of any gold there. But there are indications? There are some. But I've spent too many years looking for pie in the sky to get excited about this. Pie in the sky? Lost gold mines. Every year, thousands of idiots go out looking for them. There's the Flying Dutchman, El Pueblo Encantado. But to expect to find lost gold under one's very nose... Lost gold at the Foxfire shaft? Well, don't you know about it? It's your husband's idea. Well, he said something about dreaming of finding gold there, but he didn't say anything about an actual lost mine. How long have you two been married? Four and a half months. Oh, and you haven't had time to talk about it yet, huh? Well, that's understandable. Your husband believes that there's an old Apache gold mine in that mountain... that they closed off when the white man came. He has it straight from his Apache grandpappy. That's nonsense. Fifty years ago, a friend of my grandpappy's, a man named Miller, sank a shaft there, poked holes all over that mountain, proved there was nothing. Well, maybe your husband's right, but for $100,000, I'm doubtful. For she's a jolly good salesman for she's a jolly good salesman She put the deal across Hugh, will you shut up? She put the deal across And now we'll all be rich for she's a jolly good salesman She put the deal across I wish you'd stop kidding. I didn't do anything. A half an hour with the guy and he writes out a check for $100,000? Is that kidding? She's very seductive. We know that. Hugh, get out. You're home. Oh. Well, good night, you all. Why don't you thank the lady? Strong, silent and masterful. I warned ya. Good night. Night. Did you have a nice time? Well, if it isn't faithful mother hen waiting up for her little chick. It's still early. How about taking me over to Corwin's for a drink? I think I've had enough. On the outside looking in doesn't do anybody any good. Mmm. Anyway, all dames are the same to you, you always tell me. It's sweet of you to worry about me. Honey, I didn't do anything. Tyson was ready to be convinced. I only told him what you told me once, which was that he could revive not only a mine, but a whole town, and this place would boom again, just like in the old days. You could call it Tyson City. He liked your idea. It appealed to his ego. Oh, well, I'm happy for you. When do you start? Tomorrow. Sunday? Before he changes his mind. Night. Good night. Dart? Yeah? Nothing. Never mind. Amanda. Yes, honey? Thanks for... for helping me with Tyson. You're perfectly welcome, darling. Dart! Wait! Don't forget your lunch. Oh. Thanks. As soon as I get this thing rolling, you and I are going to spend a weekend in Tucson. We'll... We'll have all our meals in bed and just talk to each other. That's a promise. Look, we got a flower. Hey. Guess I'm the wrong type for you. No, you're not. You're just right. Maybe I'll believe you're here to stay when you get around to changing those initials. It's a 10-minute rest stop. What's he saying to them? Your guess is as good as mine. That's it, fellows. Line up. I'll give you your slips here. Now what's your name? Hello, Mr. Tyson. Hi. What was the problem? Oh, some of them believe this is sacred Apache ground. Think only disaster can come from working here. Only disaster is right. I used your suggestion that they work for shares of the gold find like the rest of us. Then, in effect, it's still an Apache project. We're in business. Well, it's easy to give away something you haven't got. I guess they're stupid enough to go for it. Mablett, you don't like this project, so why not let Dartland run it? Give him everything he needs. Suits me. You better double your accident insurance. He has an Indian friend who owns an oil well. The rest he hates. Oh, maybe you're just imagining that. Maybe he just plain hates you. Maybe. What do you say we call it a day and have a drink? Well, I got to get to Tucson tonight, but, uh, yeah, I'd like that. Mind if we take Mrs. Dartland? She's kind of alone today. I'd like that even better. Follow me. Amanda! Amanda? I'll try here. Here? There's a chance. Hello, Maria. Have you seen Amanda? No, I haven't, Dart. I haven't seen the doc either. Maybe they went off somewhere together. Where? That's what I always ask myself. Sorry I can't help you, Dart. If you see her, we'll be at Corwin's. Sure. We'll try Corwin's in town. Right. Here we are. Come on now, Harold. Don't get far away from Mother. Look, dear. Real Indians. These are the sacred masks... used in the dance to ward off the evil spirits... when one is sick and dying. You will see the actual dance later. A dance that was first performed, as far as history records, 600 years ago. The woman speaking, who is she? Oh, that's Princess Saba. Her father was some heap-big Indian chief. She's some character. I'd like to have a nickel for every photograph she's posed for. This... Harold, come back here. Is the communal home, or "cradle," as it is sometimes called. When a woman is with child, she comes here to live... until her child is born. Afterwards, the little ones move on to the "hearth" home, where the mothers, for a while, take care of them. You know, I just can't figure a girl like you spending Sunday afternoon alone. Well, don't try. A child here has little contact with his father, who in the old days was usually away hunting. Today, the father is still much away. He works on the reservation cattle range. As you see, the little boys play and have few responsibilities. But there comes a day when they are 12. Here is a little one... ready to leave his mother and go with the men. From now on, he will work and hunt with the men, eat and live with the men. He will no longer call his mother "Mother." He will call her by her tribal name, and he will never again be alone with her. Why is that? It is our custom. A boy of 12 does not cry or ask help from a woman. Nor has she need for him. They get along without each other. This is one of the differences in our cultures. I had no idea those customs were still followed. In this way we preserve our racial dignity. This little boy will never again cry or be weak. He will rely on his own strength and independence... and have no further need of anyone. And now if you will step this way, the ceremonial dances are about to begin. Mrs. Dartland. Mrs. Dartland? Mrs. Dartland used to be my name, but I have not worn it in 30 years. Well, I'm Jonathan's wife, Amanda. How do you do? This is Amanda, Rowena. My husband said you were pretty. Your husband? Walt Whitman. He was at your wedding. Oh, yes. Thank you. How is Jonathan? He's very well. We're going to have a baby. I am pleased for you. Yes, but my husband doesn't want any children. He will be happy later, when the child is of a companionable age. For now, the bearing of a child is your own special problem. Yes, I guess according to your customs, it is. You will excuse me. I have another tour to prepare. Mrs. Dartland. Saba. You must miss Jonathan, want to see him sometimes. In Apache life, the silver cord is cut early. I enjoyed love many years ago. I enjoyed it deeply. When Professor Dartland died, I knew what loss was. I did not like it. I knew then the Indian way is right. To us, death is only a temporary going away, like the setting of the sun. Love is as temporary too. The sun rises, it sets. An Indian does not cry. Please wish Jonathan well. You will excuse me now. Good-bye, Amanda. Good-bye, Mrs. Dartland. - Hi, honey. - Hello, Maria. Hello, Mrs. Dartland. Spoiled little girl. Always has to have somethin' different. Well, you've played Indian. Now it's doctor. You know what Apaches do to their wives when they're unfaithful? They brand 'em! They tear their hair out! Dart! Amanda! I went to the reservation to see your mother. I thought I'd found out something about you that'd help me understand you. But after this, I don't think I'll ever understand you. I told you I don't like tears. No, Dart. That's the way we always make it up. What's this? That new shipment of dynamite come in? No, it hasn't. What's holdin' it up? Well, don't ask me. That dust is pretty bad down there. Forget it. Hi. Hi. Can I carry your books? Oh, now, don't worry. It's all right. I haven't had a drink in I don't know how long. And I want you to be the first one to know it. Get in. Oh, thanks. I phoned you earlier. Thought you might like to go out on a call with me. I went up to see the fireworks. Oh. How was it? Terribly exciting. How's Dart? He's all right. Why don't you admit he hasn't been home for two days? Maria told you about our little street fight, huh? Yeah. Imagine, you and me. He knows how wrong he is. Dart. Dart? Hello, Mandy. Hi, Hugh. How do you feel? I'm sorry I had to get you up in the middle of the night. Ah, don't even think about it. Now, I've got a surprise for you. There, there, baby. I'm here. Everything's going to be all right. Just you have a good cry and you'll feel better. Oh, Mom. You still bringin' up bare rocks? No change yet. There will be soon. Well, you'll have to do without your chief detonator tonight. Craddock? What happened? Two nights of this rock dust, two days in our shaft. I just took him to the hospital. How much is money worth, Dartland? I'll take his place tonight. You know, it's a funny thing about a white man. He just can't work without sleep and fresh clothes... and decent food and going home once in a while. Now hold it, Dart. Take it easy, Mablett. Well, it's affecting me now. My production's fallen off 20% in the last two days. The men can't take it. Incidentally, your wife can't take it either. It might interest you to know she's in the hospital. The hospital? She's been there since last night. You should have told me about it. - Don't you trust me anymore? - Now, Mom. Living in a place like this is enough to make anyone lose a baby. A horrible place. Not even amusingly horrible. Oh, I do hope I'm not treading on anyone's tender toes, though I doubt it. A tender toe would never live in a place like this. Hello, Dart. Are you all right? Dr. Slater says she'll be herself again after a few days rest and change. Amanda. I tried to tell you, but it doesn't matter now. I'm taking her to La Paz. We've got to get the roses back in her cheeks somehow. Don't you agree, Doctor? It'd be the best thing for her. I'd like to speak to my wife alone. It'd only upset her more. Maybe in a couple of days when she's feeling better, hmm? I am awfully tired, Dart. You come and see her in a few days. Yeah. Take good care of her, Mrs. Lawrence. Oh, she's cute! Where did you get her? Oh, what a sweet puppy. Old Larky left her in payment of his bill. Susan Jr. Oh, look. I'll bring you a present every day if you promise to laugh like that. Hello, Dart. How do you feel? Much better. You look beautiful. Thanks. Oh. Look. Isn't she cute? Hugh gave her to me. Amanda, I've... I've got my suitcase in the jeep. Let's you and I go to Tucson and have that talk we promised each other. Don't they need you at the Foxfire? They'll have to get along without me for a couple of days. Can they? I know how you feel about the mine, but I'm doing it for us. If I'd wanted money, there were men I could have married. But I didn't. I only wanted you. Well... But I never did have you. Oh, you loaned yourself to me to make love, but you didn't really need me. You've told me that ever since we were married. That day with your mother I found out it isn't really your fault. You're afraid to be in love my way. I don't know. Most of my life I've been treated with some respect. But, Dart, you treat me like a squaw. When you don't want me for anything, I walk 12 paces behind. Well, I can't live that way. And I don't want to be married that way anymore. Good-bye, Dart. What's wrong? Why aren't they working? Seems I was wrong about 'em. Even they get tired. It's not that. One of their men got the shakes. What is it, Walt? What's the beef? He was leading the way tonight in the tunnel... when he was struck as if by lightning and he fell to the tunnel floor. He has not spoken or responded since. In the history of our tribe, it is said that if a man displeases an Apache god, he shall be struck down. I know these are old beliefs, but when men are frightened, they believe old stories. Why, that's ridiculous. He's ill, sure. Get him a doctor. We've called Doc Slater. Well, who's gonna finish the night shift with me? You're not gonna believe those old stories, are you? Come with me. I'll show you how much that superstitious old rot has to do with this. Well, who's coming with me? I'm with you, boss. Good. Crazy, mixed-up Indians. I can give you a hand with the dynamite. We'll need all the hands we can get. Thanks, Dart. Who else? Good. That charge is too heavy. If there is gold here, it's been here a million years. Another 10 minutes won't matter. Fire in the hole! All clear! Give me a hand, fellas. We'll have you out in a minute. It's my arm! Get me out... Watch out, men! Get him out. All right, Mahoney. Here we go. Easy does it. Careful! Let's go. Dartland! Dart. It'll only run $50,000 to the ton, that's all. You did it. Let me shake your hand. Oh. Well, congratulations to you. And to your people. Tell them they're back in the gold business again. Thank you. Oh, and get 'em back to work, will ya? Well, what do you say? You're a rich man now. You take care of those hands, will you? Well, I gotta go spread the word. Tyson City. Operator. Hello. I'd like to call the La Paz Guest Ranch, please. Mrs. Jonathan Dartland. One moment, please. La Paz Guest Ranch. This is Jonathan Dartland. I'd like to speak to Mrs. Dartland, please. Mrs. Lawrence and Mrs. Dartland checked out several hours ago, sir. Thank you. You know, in an emergency, you have hidden resources. Well, I must admit I kind of enjoyed it. I just finished the last one. Twenty-six stitches. But, uh, somebody else is gonna have to take 'em out. Why is that? I'm going back east. But this'll be quite a town now and... I've already arranged for a doctor from Tucson to take my place. I've got other plans. Amanda. You don't seem very surprised. Well, you told me you'd get her eventually. She left on the morning plane. I'm leaving tonight. It's nice you're not, uh, upset about it. Why should I be upset? You called her. I caught her at the airport and told her that Dart was hurt. I wonder how long it'd be before you'd holler for help. Sit down. Sit down. How long has this coffee been in here? A long time, I guess. Amanda, I... I did holler for help. I called you this morning. You can't just say this is it and not give me a chance. I've never been in love before. Maybe that's why I'm so slow at it. I do need you. Why didn't you say that yesterday? I was afraid to. Well, I'm not now. I'm not afraid of anything. Dart, your arms. You'll... Stay close, always. Come with me.
