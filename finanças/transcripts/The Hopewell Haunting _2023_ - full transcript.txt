- No! No! No! No! Stop! Stop! No! No! Stop! No! No! No! No! No! No! Stop! Please stop! No! No! No! No! Stop! No! No! - Hey! You all can't be sleepin' in here! - Sorry. Sorry. Are you the pastor? - Yes, I am! - Um, my name is Newt Fryman. This here's my wife, Ollie. - Okay? What's the matter with you boy? - Do you go out and bless houses and all of that? I need you to take a look at this house we just got. - Why? - You believe in haints? - Is that why you come pilin' up in here? - Yes, sir. Sorry about that. We didn't know where else to go. Well, this ain't the place, so you best just go on down the road. - We don't know who else to go to. - Where are you all from? - Sir, we just moved here from Jackson. - Sounds about right. - Look, I know you're busy and I hate to bother you, but you think you could just come and take a look at it? It ain't too far away. Please. It's just, we just need something so that we can go back and stay there. - Where's it at? - It's off route 6 there by the wooden bridge, but you can't see it from the road. It's down a little lane there, past the bridge, off to the left just down a ways. - Well, if it'll make you able to sleep in your own place. - Yes sir. Thank you, brother. Sorry to bother you. Sorry. - Son-of-a-bitch! Hello? Heavenly father, I come to you today to ask that you fill this home with your joy, your love and your presence. Lord so that this couple can peacefully dwell here, and use it for all your eternal glory. In your most precious and glorious name, Amen. - Workin' for Mr. Graves should get us by until tobacco season is over, but we should be good until about winter time. I guess I'll have to start makin' some liquor if he don't have any work for me after that. Did ya find it? - I guess? It's that big ole brick house upon a hill, the one that looks like it's about ready to fall in? - Yes, sir. - I gotta tell ya, it's a wonder I didn't get lost. That place is clear out to Harrison County! - It's a little further away than I realized I guess. Did ya find anything? - No! Other than piles of crap everywhere and a dead raccoon, no! I didn't see or hear a thing! The surprise is you didn't get sick livin' in a place like that! - Yeah well, we was gonna clean it, but we just moved in last night. You say a prayer? - Yep! - Thanks, brother. Really. Let's get goin'. - Lord, I am not in the mood for this again. Did you let them in? So what is it today? Huh?! - It's still out there. - What is? - Didn't you say a blessing? - I swear! Alright Newt, I know you been lookin' around that house, now haven't ya? And I know you saw the dead raccoon upstairs, now didn't ya? Well what does that tell ya? - I saw it again. - What does that tell ya?! That that barn of a house that you're livin' in is probably infested with God no telling what! - Brother. - What? - There's somethin' else out there. - Okay, what then? - Would you please go out there one more time, and say a blessing or a prayer or somethin'? - Newt. A prayer and a blessing ain't gonna run off a bunch of raccoons or whatever else is livin' in your place, and common sense should tell you that you shouldn't have to bless a house every day just to live in it! Especially one that looks like that! I ain't goin' back out there. I don't know what else to tell ya! - Thanks for makin' this so easy on us. I hope you go home to a nice, big house, a nice family, and sleep well tonight. - Alright! If it'll make you feel better, and it'll make you happy, then I'll go back out there! And I'll tell you what! This time I'm gonna stay there all day long, until I see or hear whatever it is that's scarin' you so bad that you up and run! - Well, hey there! - Hey, Mr. Pierce! How're you? - Nice day for a drive. Can't' complain. - Yeah. - Yeah. You get settled in yet? - Yeah. I guess. - You been out to see Mr. Graves yet? - Yeah. I went up and saw him yesterday. Said he's got somethin' for me today so... we're headed out there. - Well, good. I was able to put in a good word for ya. - Appreciate that. Thank you, sir. - Trust me, if you do good work for him, he'll always have somethin' for you to do. - I hope so. - You're goin' there now? - Yeah. - Well, hop in. Save yourself some time. - Okay. You sure? - Of course. - Mighty appreciate it. Here, Ollie. - How's miss Ollie today? - Ah, she's good. A little tired, I reckon. Yep, that's it. Thank you for wasting another day! No! No! Nooo! Stop! - Stop! No! No! Stop! - Thank you, Mr. Pierce. - Say hello to brother James for me. - Will do. You saw it. Brother? - I don't know what you two are trying to pull, but I'm in no shape to deal with it! - What? What do you mean, what we're trying to pull? What do you mean, what we're trying to pull? - Listen, I'm 71 years old and I can't deal with it. I want you all out of here, okay? - Brother. - I said, I want you two out of here, and I don't want you to come back. - Brother, I don't know what else to do. - I don't care. This is my church, and I don't want you or whatever this is around it. - We don't know where else to go. - I'm sorry. I can't help you anymore, but you can't stay here. No, no! - Mrs. Frank, how are you this morning? Listen, I just got some country ham and wondered if I could bring over a couple slices for you all next week. Would you appreciate that? Preacher is a little late this morning. Hey Sears, how are you doin'? Isabelle, how are you? Still not here? - No, sir. Not yet. - Christine, have you heard from him at all? - No. - Should we just start without him? - No. Brother James? Brother James? - What do you want, Charles? - What do you mean, what do I want? I'm coming to see if you're okay. - I'm fine. - Then why didn't you show this morning? I guess I just didn't feel like it. - What? Are you sick? - No. - Well here, get up. We gonna have us a little talk. - Come on! Get up! What's the matter with you? - Nothin' is the matter with me, Charles. Now what do you want? - Well, besides you not showing up this morning, do you want to tell me why you ran Newt and Ollie Fryman off yesterday? - Now how do you know them? - You don't worry about how I know them. I know you told them to leave and not come back now. Didn't ya? Didn't ya? - Yes, I did because I don't want them around my congregation. - And why is that? All they did was ask you to go out to that house and figure out what was wrong with it. Is that somethin' you can't handle? I went to that house twice, and I blessed it just like they asked me to. - Then why are they too scared to go back out there then? - You know how them ole' backwards mountain people are! They believe everything they see and hear is a haint, and I do not want that thinkin' around my congregation. - James, Newt Fryman is a good fella. His wife has her problems, but you don't know how hard they got it right now. A lot harder than you, trust me! Least you could do is help them out! - Now why aren't you helpin'? - I am helping them out! I'm the one that got them that house out there and now they're stayin' with me because you can't do your job! - You gave them that house? - Yes! - Well, why would you give that place to anyone? - Because it's still a good house and he didn't have nowhere else to go. - Charles, it ain't fit to live in! Trust me! - And why is that? - Because it just ain't. - No! I want to know! Tell me! Alright, whatever. Ignore me then, but I'm gonna tell you somethin', and you better listen. If you don't get your ass together and help these people, then you better start packin' and lookin' for a new town to go preachin' in! You know, I held my tongue for years and watched you run good people off after they brought you problem after problem, and you ignored it! And I ain't gonna do it anymore! - What problems? - And don't even get me started on that church. It's hideous! Now I don't know what you're goin' through, or what your problem is, and I don't care! You better do somethin' and you better do somethin' soon! You know I ran that old joker off that was there before you, and by God I ain't afraid to do it again! You hear me?! You heard me. - You said he's okay though? - Oh, he's fine. He's still piled up in the bed if you can believe that. - He didn't say what was the matter? - He didn't say anything. More than likely, it's just another one of his spells. - I didn't know if it was because of me or what. - Oh, no. It had nothin' to do with you, Newt. - I hope not. - He's been like that for years. More than likely, he's still hung up on the same thing; some girl he used to court a long time ago. - He ain't married? - Nope. Never has. - I figured he was married. - Well, I wanna say they were supposed to get married, but then one day that girl just up and ran off on him, found another fella, got married, and he found out about it. - How long ago was that? - Oh, that's when he first got here. About eighteen and eighty. About fifty years ago, lordy. - Jeez. - I don't think he's ever courted another girl since then. That's probably what his problem is, but then again I never seen him so bad that he missed services before. Somethin' else may be botherin' him. God, help me. Please, help me. Please. - I can't imagine how much money Mr. Pierce has. Must be pretty nice. Aw, baby. Come here. It'll be alright. What I got is better than any amount of money you can give me. - Oh, there ya are. Y'all about ready to go? - Yes, sir. I was looking at that painting over there. Is that your wife? - Oh, no. That's my sister, if you can see the resemblance. I used to be a lot thinner in those days. - Yeah, I guess I can now. She was a beautiful lady. - She was, but no, I tried courtin' once and just decided I'd be better off on my own. Shew, not me! - Lord, give me strength. Who are you?! - No... No... Stop! Stop! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! - What do you want?! You're not scaring me! You hear?! Lord, give me strength. I can't run away from this. Heavenly father, give me the strength to face this thing. Come lord, come holy spirit and fill this place. Fear, evil leave! In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are you and what is it that you want? Come here! - I've never seen such a mess! - Any way of tellin' who it is? - You know, they've been down there a good long time. Makes it a lot harder, ya know? - Well, what do you normally do then? - Well, check the missing persons report-- I'm not aware of any in the county. Basically file a report and bury 'em. Yep. - I'd say whoever it was, was probably killed and put down there, don't you think? - You may be right. No way of knowin'. Well, I'm gonna go back to the office, file a report, check on things and probably bury 'em later today. That reminds me, I'm gonna need somebody to bury 'em. Would you be willing? - No. I don't want nothin' to do with that. - Okay. No, I probably should. Whoever it was , is deserving a proper burial. - Okay. If it's alright with you. - Yeah. - I'm goin' back to the station, and I'll probably see you later this afternoon, or sometime this evening. Charles. - James. - I was just stopping by to see if Newt and Ollie were here. - No, they're not here right now. Why? - I just wanted to apologize to them, and tell them that the house is okay now. - Oh yeah? Alright, I'll tell them. - And I wanted to apologize to you too, Charles. I'm sorry for handling things the way I did. - Yeah? - I went back out there, and the house is gonna be okay now. - Good. I'll let 'em know. - Okay. Thank you. - See you at bible study Wednesday. - I'll see you then. - Do you want to say somethin' for them? Oh lord... Amen. Hello. - Brother. - Charles tell you everything is okay now? - Yeah. Thank you, Brother. - Newt, I wanted to apologize to you for treating you the way that I did. You didn't deserve that. - It's okay, brother. Really. - I'm sorry I'd like you to know that you and Ollie are welcome in my church any time. - Thank you. - I'd love to have you start comin' on Sunday morning. - Okay. - And Newt, don't be scared to ask for whatever help you may need from now on, okay? - We won't. - I guess I'll let you start enjoying your house finally. - Thank you, brother. Thanks again. Come on, babe.
