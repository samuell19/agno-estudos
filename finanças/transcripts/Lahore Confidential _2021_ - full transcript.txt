Mom! Mom! Wait here. Don't look over there. 'Pakistan will be destroyed. This attack will be avenged.' 40 of our CRPF soldiers died. We've tightened our screws on Masood Azhar and Hafiz Sayyed, but that's Pakistan. Like the heads of Hydra, you chop off one and another surfaces. Wasim Ahmed Khan is the enemy's new recruit. His name always comes up for terror-financing against India. What else do you know apart from his name? Where does he stay, what does he do? What is his modus operandi? With international agents always on alert, he is using highly sophisticated routes. Shell companies and tax havens like Mauritius, companies in the Middle East... I've heard he's wealthier and far more dangerous than both of them. Just like Osama Bin Laden, very protected! Do our agents or your informants know anything about him? There is one man who can provide us some leads. But he keeps his distance from me. I guess he knows I'm an Indian agent. Who? Rauf Ahmed Kazmi. He's a cultural event organiser. The who's who of Pakistan, international diplomats, politicians and army bigwigs... Everyone attends his parties and poetry symposiums. If we get him to become our informant... Rauf Ahmed Kazmi. Does he indulge in poems? We have someone whom he might like to befriend. RD, I know who you are talking about. She's... RD, she has done a desk job in a media company all her life. Exactly! So, no one will suspect that she is one of our agents. RD, she is very emotional. Did you look at yourself in the mirror? There's no need to. Come. You need to work on yourself. Okay. At least you can wear earrings! It... - It matches with your suit! Mom, I'm going to office, not to a fashion show! I see! At least wear dark lipstick. Pink lipstick is barely even visible! Wear this. Come on. I am already wearing kajal. I said you have to wear this! Come on. Tell me something. - Yes? Isn't there a single nice guy in your office? They're all nice. Didn't you like anyone in all these years? Why are you staring at me? I'm not overstepping! It makes sense! Earlier, you'd get many proposals! And now? There is a widower. He's the son of Mrs Gupta's sister-in-law. Should I talk to him? I don't want to get married. - You have to! But I wonder which Prince Charming you are waiting for! If biological moms are like this, I wonder how stepmothers are! Anu! Hey! You never listen to anything important I say! 'My heart is a desert' 'that yearns for the oasis of your love.' 'Why can't you share your love?' 'Your love is not rain that it can quench my thirst.' 'But even a few drops shall bring me respite.' What are you saying, Ananya? You've always wanted an international posting. You used to tell me you wanted to go abroad for a year or two. Your words. Yes. But, sir, I meant Dubai, Thailand or Doha. Something close. Which mom and I could visit every couple of months. Pakistan is closer. Yes. But my mom won't go to Pakistan. Besides, the Indian High Commission staff there is always terrified. You never know what might happen. Sir, the rest have families. I am single. You know? What will I do there all alone without any friends? Ananya, do you know what your biggest problem is? You get emotional about everything. Yukti lives there alone too. She'll guide you. And also, there's a possibility that you could become an Intelligence Agent from a Media Attach√©. It's a possibility. There are other benefits of going to Pakistan. They said I could write my book there at the government's expense. I'll get to meet the upcoming poets in Pakistan, and then... Mom, please don't worry. It's a matter of one year. You'll grow older by a year! You know what? Let's go out. I'll marry the first guy we come across! Okay? It's like talking to a brick wall! Mom, wait! Don't be angry! Tomorrow, I'll be gone for an entire year. Then we'll meet after a year. Do you want to die unmarried? You'll never find a boy in Pakistan. What if I meet a Pakistani guy? Your name? Your favourite flower! Jasmine? - That. Even Chameli will do. Feisty Chameli. Your number? I will call you the next time your turn comes. Hey! Where did you go? Just for a quick fuck! Is that part of the job? - Of course! How else will you get information? A drink? No, thanks. I'm just fucking with you, babe! - Oh! It's a good cover. No one will even suspect that you could be a regular RAW agent, that too Indian! Besides, it's kind of my passion too. Passion? - Yes. Look. We're adversaries in politics. But nothing compares to Pakistani hospitality. Just look at these hot-bodied Pathans! How can I turn them down when they offer themselves to me? Besides, I prefer them to the French. You know! Skin tone, rough! Rugged! Rauf Ahmed Kazmi! I've saved the best for you, by the way. Ananya, meet Rauf, the organiser of this amazing party. - Hello. And, Rauf, meet Ananya, from Indian High Commission. I hope you're enjoying yourself. Yes. But I'm a bit boring. I don't drink or smoke. So... She doesn't even have sex! What? So, you have a thing against getting high. An unknown poet has put it very well, 'Weak are those who sin...' 'And those who need alcohol to get drunk.' 'For us, love alone is enough to feel the high.' 'My beloved's gaze is the only thing that gets me intoxicated.' Beautiful. 'I did walk out of your revelry,' 'but only my heart really knows of the love whence I now return.' Are you absolutely sure? There's a lot of movement at the border, ma'am. Especially in this region. The coordinates are marked. A lot of earth-moving equipment and drills have arrived here. Are they making an underground tunnel? - Yes, ma'am. Check who is funding these companies. - I've already done it, ma'am. They are not regular funders like the last three times. There's a money trail until one point. But it's a dead end beyond that. Wasim Ahmed Khan. Ma'am, the anti-India network I have joined has been throwing around the name of some tech-savvy billionaire. He could be our man. And he must not be making only one tunnel. Before he takes another step against India, just... Ma'am, I've heard that every time he sends suicide bombers to India, he makes it a point to meet them. So, I have volunteered. God willing, you'll have an eye on Wasim Ahmed Khan soon. Good job. It's time for the evening prayers. I think we should leave. James Spencer is amazing! Such an astute understanding of Indo-Pak relations. Did something happen between you and Rauf last night? What happened? I told him about my book. I'm a huge fan of Urdu poetry actually. Yes! You're writing a book on Pakistan's present-day poet. Right? - Exactly. And he's an event organiser. He organises a lot of poetry symposiums. He said he would introduce me to some poets. Then? What then? What happened? Oh! I don't know him like that. Ananya! He's the biggest event organiser in town. The who's who of Pakistan government, ISI and his non-government actors... You never know who you might run into! Yes! Rauf never approached Yukti! That's because he's gay! - Yeah! Look. He invited you, and you have to go. You should definitely go. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen! - Greetings. I take pleasure in welcoming all of you. Love is in the air tonight. I dedicate this evening to lovers like you. Let's add some colour to the evening. Let's dedicate this evening to love. The beloved's presence tugs at the heartstrings. Let's make this a night to remember for them. I'd like to first invite Mr Sarfaraz Ahmed to take the stage. 'I need to get through this time difficult.' 'But better than others.' - Great! 'The time I spend alone doesn't matter.' 'It's the time I spend with you that must be memorable.' - Wow! That was brilliant. - Wow! Ladies and gentlemen. - Yes... May I have your attention, please? - Come. I'll introduce you to the poets. - 'I'd like to start' 'by saluting each one of you.' Greetings. - Greetings. Sarfaraz. Lahore's exceptional poet. Yes, I'm a big fan. Sir, mutton kebabs? It is not in my nature to kill innocent animals for their meat. Does that mean you don't eat meat or consume liquor? 'It is a question of my pride...' I like to be in my senses. You're an interesting man, Mr Kazmi. Why, thank you! But not as interesting as you, Ananya! 'Thank you so much.' Please excuse me. I'll take a round. Sure. - It goes like this. 'I make do with her memories.' 'I make do with her memories.' 'I ruined my life with my own hands.' Very good! - Wonderful. Thank you so much. - Brilliant. 'Here's another poem. - Alright.' 'Here it goes. - Yes.' 'One after the other...' 'One after the other... - They all left.' 'One after the other, they all left.' 'All my loved ones abandoned me.' - Wonderful! I want Shamsher and Rathi back home safe and sound before sunset! Do whatever you need to do! But I want them back safe! 'Bastards! How dare they?' Relax, RD. 'This is part of the pathological hostility' 'exhibited by Pakistan in the past.' Mind-games. In other words, mind fucked! Yukti. - Sorry, sir. Sir, how did they know that Shamsher is our agent? Everyone knows who are our agents in the High Commission. But it's the secret agents on the field that no one knows about. This bastard! My sources tell me he abducted Shamsher and Rathi. Sir. I'll send it to you, sir. 'Ananya...' - Sir. 'What is it?' - I've seen him in... Sir, I saw him at Rauf's poetry symposium. 'Yukti, get intel on this!' - On it, RD. 'Ananya. Good job, girl.' Thank you. Thank you, sir. Yes, I'll be waiting for your call. Okay, fast. Yukti. Yes? - Look what James Spencer wrote. Even he knows this is the man responsible. Listen. Will you call Shamsher and Rathi's family and tell them that everything will be fine? I'm not very comfortable with this emotional shit. But will everything be alright? Of course! They're Indian diplomats. If anything happens, the International Committee will be on it! You've been with RAW for so many years. Have you forgotten all the protocols after one just incident? Should we try to get a meeting with James Spencer? He could tell us where they are. See what he's writing. 'India will blame Pakistan.' 'Pakistan will say that India staged it so that Pakistan gets a bad name.' 'And this ping pong will continue ad nauseam.' He'll die. - Who? Either the kidnapper or your hero, James Spencer. If someone can so openly write about all this, ISI will hunt him down and... Oh! Thank God they're back. Yukti! - Happens all the time! Relax. It's standard tit for tat. You know that, Ananya. I know. Last week, we abducted their man. So, they abducted you two this week. Still, they say that India stage-managed all this. But... But what? Sir, I don't know how he can laugh like this. Because we signed up for this, Ananya. We know what we're going to do. In fact, even they know what we're going to do. Yes! We're like an old husband and his wife. We hate each other. Yet, we stay together. And we know each other very well. Our moves are predictable. But who was that man? And what's his connection to Rauf Kazmi? We'll know soon. Yes? - 'Did you read James Spencer's new article?' He's saying the kidnapper was called Suleiman Naqvi. We don't know whether he was an Indian or a Pakistani agent. But he's been eliminated. He wasn't one of our agents. Must have been with the ISI. 'Greetings. There's a poetry symposium tomorrow.' 'I'll be waiting for you.' 'I guess you are busy.' 'This Friday, some accomplished poets...' She doesn't step out of her apartment! 'I think she's scared.' RD, only through Ananya we can get the details of Rathi and Shamsher's kidnappers. Should I tell Ananya the truth? I don't think it's a good idea. She might get nervous and do something that might comprise the mission. 'Okay?' - Fine. 'Weak are those who sin.' 'For us, love alone is enough to feel the high.' 'Are you alright?' Yes. 'You don't seem fine.' How do you define fine? Come back. It must be boring all by yourself there. You have no friends nor do you go out. Right? Listen. Someone from your office was kidnapped. What would I have done had it been you? Are you worried about me or yourself? Talking to you is a sin! I'm a fool for forgoing my serial and talking to you! You called me. Okay, bye! 'Life is long.' 'It is difficult to live alone.' 'Get married.' 'I had never imagined there would be such a great distance between us.' 'He was right before me, and yet not close to me.' Hi! Who died? And why are you alone in the house? Where's your chocolate boy? He calls me but I don't answer the phone. I'm not sure whether to meet him or not. Hmm. Would you like to meet James Spencer? Yes, definitely. You've already met him. - I don't think so. I'm telling you. And I have a feeling you have slept with him. If I haven't met him, the question doesn't arise. Have you been drinking in the morning? Ta-da! Rauf Ahmad Kazmi aka James Spencer! No! What! Rauf is James Spencer! - Yes. Clearly, Rauf receives the information and James Spencer publishes it. Obviously hates violence. Anti-war types. But if he is indeed James Spencer, wouldn't the government know? Had they known, Rauf would have been dead! He's wily, he's smart and not a bad guy. Just look at that smile! Now, you'll call him and take his calls. I'll answer if he calls me. - Hmm. I'm hungry. Get me something to eat. Beat it! Excuse me. I'm sorry. Why are you saying sorry? The kidnapper turned out to be my acquaintance. So many people attend your events. You can't take responsibility for all of them. Thank you. Your memories made me restless. I'm glad you're here, or I'd have become really uneasy. Come. I'll introduce you to Mr Anjum Jawed. Oh! Mr Anjum Jawed. Ananya Shrivastav. - Greetings. Hello. Yes, Mom. - What are you doing out at this hour? You know the Pakistanis abducted Shamsher! 'What if they abduct you...' - Yes, Mom. But I'm not alone. I'm with a friend. - Friend! What friend? Show me! 'Show me or I'll switch to video call!' 'Greetings, ma'am.' 'I am Rauf, Ananya's friend.' You can rest assured. I will drop her home safely. 'Yes, Mom. I'll call you in the morning. Okay? Bye.' Sorry. It's just the two of us. So... Are you alright? Are you alright? - Are you hurt? No! Thank God you're fine! Let me help you. You live all alone in this mansion. What about your parents, wife or sister? There is no one in the world I can call family. 9 June 2009. We were celebrating dad's birthday at Pearl Hotel. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Why are you sorry? Those despicable, dastardly terrorists should be sorry! The Taliban, Lashkar, CIA, RAW, ISI! God knows what they wanted to prove by taking innocent lives! My family... I'm sorry. Please. It's okay. We had an accident last night. Rich spoilt brats! ISI or terrorists? I'm sure James Spencer will find out! Hmm! So, did you and chocolate boy do it? Don't pretend! How's the hottie in bed? I'm not sleeping with him. He's just a friend. You can't think of anything other than sex! Coward! You have a problem just talking about it! You're blunt! What were you doing at Oxford? 'Licking arses and getting my arse licked!' On a serious note, you should be ready to do anything with anyone. Otherwise, you're not fit to be a field agent. As an agent, we have no friends or lovers. Work should be your priority. Remember, they're our enemies. Forever fucking with India. They must have the same opinion about us. That we interfere in Balochistan. Stay out of Balochistan and stay out of politics. And... And? Don't be serious with Rauf or James Spencer. How did you know 'rajma' is my favourite? 'The ambience resonated with the jingling of my bangles.' 'It was neither initiated by me nor the bangles.' 'Was it your desire that turned it into a reality?' 'Or was I just oblivious' 'that the ambience resonated with the jingling of my bangles?' 'This is love, not a trade of hearts.' 'I can spend my entire life with your thoughts alone.' 'You smile at the mention of my name.' 'That's all the love I could ever want.' My name is Qadir. I have been looking after the mansion and Rauf for years. Okay. Where is Rauf? Please come inside. I'll call him. Okay. That's my loved ones. This was my home. But after the blast, it is all brick and wall. After that, I could not live here nor leave. I'm sorry. I wish there were something I could say to make this better. Or something I could do. Forgive me if possible. I hid the truth from you. No. Actually... I know that you are the political analyst and media commentator, James Spencer. This is my reality. In 2009, when I was forced to quit my studies abroad and come back, I became agitated. Earlier, I wanted vengeance. Then I remembered what my dad used to say. Everyone lives for themselves. But living for others is a life worth truly living. That's when I decided that I would kill the people who murdered the innocent. No matter who it was. The ISI, RAW, or someone pretending to be a saviour of the faith! Terrorists! Organising these large-scale events helps me stay updated on them. No one is Indian or Pakistani to me. They're either murderers or victims. And I'm every murderer's enemy. How will you honour the enmity? By killing them? By killing the culprit I save thousands of lives. I was the one who killed Shamsher's kidnapper. He was a gun for hire. A mercenary. I don't hate any particular religion. I hate this bloody clandestine war and everyone who is a part of it. I don't want what happened to me to happen to anybody else. It would have been better had you not told me this. Only cowards uphold love by keeping their identities a secret. You understand other people's feelings and empathise with them. You deserved to know my truth. 'I want to spend the rest of my life with you.' 'The decision is up to you.' 'If you agree,' 'we will go far away from here.' 'Where no one cares if you're Muslim or Hindu.' 'Nor Indian or Pakistani.' 'Where there are no boundaries and no terror.' 'Will you come with me?' 'I'll go anywhere you take me.' When are you leaving for India? In a week as soon as the tunnel is ready. I'll keep you informed. Ma'am, I've found a source of Khan's money trail. The source will lead us to Khan in a few days. Don't worry. You'll have an eye on Khan soon. I'm sure. You don't worry either. I'll inform RD. We won't let anything happen to you. And as discussed, I'll be right there. So, if you need any help... - Please! Don't compromise the mission because of me. Even if you catch that terrorist Khan after I die, I'll be at peace knowing I attained my life's purpose. I wish the country could know of your bravery. We've known it from the beginning. There's neither fame nor wealth in this job. I don't want anything apart from the country's victory and the respect of my colleagues. This is ISI agent Abdul Wahid Khan. After Dubai, Nepal and Bihar, he is currently hiding in Bhalswa slum in Delhi. He plans on blowing up a hotel. Which hotel? In which city? - I don't know. That's why I'm telling you. Please tell Yukti. If Khan divulges any information, the lives of many Indians can be saved. Is it ready? - Yes, sir? Why are you telling me? I didn't ask you. Everyone knows what who does in the embassy. For instance, you work for RAW. But you're not an agent. RAW must have a dossier on me too. They might know about James Spencer too. As for my identity, apart from me and Qadir, you're the only one who knows. What if I told this to Yukti? If I were to die at your hands, it would be a beautiful way to go. Don't say such things. I've fallen in love for the first time. A girlfriend knows all your secrets. That's what poets believe. Even I don't wish to hide anything from you. They asked me to extract information from you. It's great that I gave you the information on my own! Ma'am, our source has been compromised. But we have what we needed. Meet me now. - 'No, ma'am. It's too risky.' 'For now, we have to get back to our respective covers.' Okay. Be under the radar. Be safe. We'll meet at meeting point 4. Okay? Sure, ma'am. Done. You were planning a bomb blast, you scoundrel! He got caught! Yes. But his papers were fake. But the information was correct. Yes. Go meet your chocolate boy. Happy birthday, ma'am. Hey! I wish you'd recite a poem for me! I'm an ordinary event organiser. I wouldn't dare recite a poem for you. 'Where is the birthday girl?' - That's Shamsher! Excuse me. Thank you so much for coming. - Birthday girl. Wish you a happy birthday. - Thank you. Thanks. We caught Khan. But he won't talk. No problem. At least a few lives were saved. You look worried. I've heard there's going to be a gruesome murder. When? Where? Who is giving orders? RAW. For the sake of the Balochis living in Karachi and Peshawar, my mole was living with the Commander of Balochistan. But he got caught. They killed him. Did he say something? Tell me. Yukti is leading the operation. 'Stay out of Balochistan and stay out of politics.' I need her phone. There must be information on her phone. I have to get it somehow. No! What if you get caught? I'm not going to die. You'll see. I reside in your heart. Wow! That was amazing! Will you both continue your poetry session or come and enjoy the feast too? Actually, he insisted on leaving. I told him you'd feel bad. Of course. Let's cut the cake! "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday, dear Yukti." "Happy birthday to you." Have some. - Alright! I want to have cake. 'Happy birthday to you! - Thank you.' 'Let's go. - Thank you.' 'One selfie, Yukti. - Sure. Thank you.' Mine's there. - Yes. 'Yes, I know. Where's my gift?' 'I didn't bring a gift...' Shamsher! Where are you going? I had too much beer. So, I'm going to the washroom. Just wait. I can't hold it in anymore. Rauf, don't do it! The flush is not working actually. - It's okay. When Ghulam Ali performs, he will call us there. Okay! Okay. Hello. Where are you going? Actually, I forgot I had to video call dad. I'll just come... - Where's your phone? It's getting charged in the bedroom upstairs. Yes, you be with the guests. I'll go and get it. Birthday girl! Stop now, please! You will get caught! Ananya, my phone! Ananya! Where are you? No... - I have to call dad! 'Listen... Yes! - Ananya, I need my phone!' 'I've been asking you for so long! My dad will go to bed!' 'Just give the... - I...' Yukti, sorry. Do you have a Band-Aid? Oh! - The door... Yeah, sure. One second. Thank you. I have to call dad. Is my phone charged or not? Let me just see. Dad. Dad! How are you? I know it's late. Thank you so much. 'There was information about three agents on Yukti's phone.' 'I've given it to the commander of Balochistan.' What if you had been caught? I don't care about myself. You shouldn't have gotten involved. Don't worry about me. Promise me one thing. That you won't do anything of this sort again. 'If I were to give up on my purpose, then wouldn't I die?' 'Your life belongs to me now.' 'If you die, wouldn't I be shattered?' Please don't say such things. If something had happened to you because of me, I would never have been able to forgive myself. I am fine, and nothing will happen to me. Just take care. Good night. 'How do you explain this, RD?' 'Three of our best agents compromised!' 'Six months of planning, and what do we have to show for it?' 'One aborted mission!' - I'm sorry, sir. 'And they know. The Pakis know!' 'How the fuck?' Sir, there's a mole and we need to find who he is. And I'm on to it. 'You have a week. Fix it or else...' Sure, sir. I shall do that. Three agents were killed in broad daylight. An open attack on such a scale had never happened before, sir. But, sir, apart from you and Mr Chawla, no one knew about them. Shut up, More! Are you trying to say that we... - Relax, Jadhav. He's just trying to check. There are two more agents. Defence Attach√© Shamsher Singh and Yukti Mohan. But, sir, they are highly trained agents. How will we know which one is the mole? Ananya Shrivastav. I'll talk to her. My cat amongst the pigeons! Rauf Ahmad Kazmi, how could you do this to me? How could you? I trusted you! They were our agents! They were Indian! They were my people! You realise what you've done! You've made me a murderer! I am responsible for their deaths and accountable to their families! You've been mourning for your family to this day! And you... You have rendered three women widows and four children orphans! I will never forgive you. I hate you. And he saved the lives of 80 children. And he saved 20 women from becoming widows. The difference is that those are Pakistani lives and the lives of innocent people. Those three terrorists were in league with the Taliban, and were going to send a suicide bomber to a madrasa! Thank God that... I don't believe you. Look at this. Three RAW agents along with the Taliban team. Those three weren't Indian agents. They were time-serving mercenaries. Your hatred is justified. Believe me. I hate myself way more than you hate me. Because I brought tears to your eyes. This war... I never wanted to make you a part of this war! Just my life. They destroyed my family and their happiness. I will not let any more lives be destroyed for as long as I can. I thought you... That we could go far away. Montenegro or Mauritius. I thought today... I thought that today... What had you thought? I am afraid they might get to you through me. It's possible that RAW suspects you and not Yukti. No. Ananya. The information was retrieved from Yukti's cell phone. No... No. Ananya, the information was on Yukti's phone only. And Shamsher was the only other person who knew about it. Do you have any suspicion of their actions? Sir, how can I... I mean, how can I name anyone? Did you see any change in Yukti's behaviour or pattern? 'Come on, Ananya! Speak up!' If you can't do it, I'll get somebody else on this job! Sir, I'm not... I'm not judging her at all. But... But ever since I've come here, Yukti's Pakistani lovers... They might have inadvertently or by mistake... - Deliberately! Fifty thousand dollars were transferred to Yukti's account. That's a lot of money! 'She sold our agents out for money!' Anyway, good job, Ananya. Good job. 'You should be ready to do anything with anyone.' 'Come over to Rauf's at the earliest. From Qadir.' Qadir. Hello. - Greetings. Is Rauf alright? Why did you call me urgently? And why didn't he call me? Is everything alright? Rauf! This is the blueprint of the Indian High Commission! Rauf, you... Who is this man? He's responsible for the bomb blast at Pearl Hotel! Zaid Abbasi! What does he have to do with the Indian High Commission? I've heard that Zaid and RAW have planned a serial bomb blast in Pakistan. And the entire plan and the proofs are on Subramaniam's computer. So, you... Are you thinking of infiltrating into the Indian High Commission? Rauf, it's madness! I won't let you do it! Give me two days. Please. Just two days. Has Mr Subramaniam arrived? Sir is in a conference but will be back by five. Okay. Yes, RD? Sir! I was looking for you, sir. I needed some approvals for next week. Yes, it's okay. Okay? Okay. - I'll get it. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. Sorry, sir. Sir... I just came to ask for leaves actually. Sir, I want to go home. I do understand the work pressure. But what can I do? We're low on staff, Ananya. I'll see what I can do. Sure, sir. Thank you. Ananya! I'm really sorry. I'll try my best. Thank you, sir! The fuckers I am tracking tracked me! I was tracing their money. And I didn't check my accounts where someone had dumped money! The result is I'm suspended till fucking further inquiry takes place! Wow! - God! Please don't start crying! I wonder what the future holds. At least let me get my last Pakistani Pathan in Pakistan! Too much beer. I'll be right back. Hi. - Meet me outside the hotel. Where are you? - Hurry up! Ananya. - Don't touch me! Just listen to me. - No! Shush! Shush! - Rauf! This was never part of the plan, Rauf. Killing Yukti! It's over. I can't settle down with the man who killed my friend. Is that how little you trust me? And yourself? And our love? I wouldn't have been able to look you in the eye had I killed Yukti. Are you trying to say you had nothing to do with this blast? This blast was done by RAW. What rubbish! Why would RAW kill their own agents? Think. Who would benefit from Yukti's death? Pakistan? - Yes! ISI? - Yes! No! Yukti's murder was revenge. RAW avenged the death of their agents. But you said those agents had become mercenaries. Exactly! RAW would never admit that their agents were bought off. Including Yukti. - No! Yes! They were executed and will be termed heroes so that RAW's image doesn't get tarnished! That's what's happening! These political manoeuvres, espionage... This world is not meant for good people like you. Why the fuck couldn't you save her? Why didn't you save her? Why didn't you save her? They would have come after you. Yukti had to go. But how could I have let anything happen to you? Calm down. The situation here is going to spiral out of control. It would be best if you went to India for a few days. We shall indeed celebrate Diwali this year together. Ananya, your leave application is approved. But make sure Shabnam gets a complete handover. Right, sir. I'll do my best, sir. Good luck. Thank you. This is my first book. I was sent to Pakistan by the government for research. My second book need not necessarily be about Pakistani poets too. Excuse me. You copied information from Yukti's phone and passed it on to Rauf. And we lost three of our agents. They weren't terrorists. They were our agents. We weren't planning any bomb blast to take innocent lives. Those agents were trained to infiltrate Pakistani society and to hunt the people who were funding the terrorist organisations, which is exactly why RD sent you to Pakistan. And you have single-handedly found out one of the biggest funders of terrorism. Rauf Ahmed Kazmi. His event management and his so-called rebel with the cause were a disguise. And the one who killed them is your Rauf! Shamsher told us that you went to the bedroom toilet many times. That's when we grew suspicious of you. 'I had beer... - Use the one downstairs. I can't hold it in anymore.' That's why we began keeping an eye on you and that fraud Rauf! What about the money in Yukti's account? Rauf transferred the money. It wasn't to protect you. He did it to use you. And he had got Shamsher kidnapped. It was all a set-up. The accident with that SUV... 'And you... - No!' 'Thank God you're fine.' Everything was a set-up to impress you. 'Wonderful.' 'I've fallen in love for the first time.' 'A girlfriend knows all your secrets.' If you knew my truth, why did you let me steal information for Mr Subramaniam's office? So that Rauf or his boss Qadir don't get suspicious. Qadir? - Yes. ISI Agent Jalal Ul Haq! You have all the evidence. Please, no matter what it is... NIA, UAPA, CBI, NSA... I'm ready for everything. That's not needed. We don't want the Pakistanis to even get a whiff that we know your reality. While we were keeping an eye on you, we also learnt the truth about Rauf and Qadir. But there is one truth that I wish to tell you. Rauf's family is alive. What! - They're not dead. This is his wife Najma, son, Farooq and daughter, Asiya. Neither is he Rauf Ahmed Kazmi or James Spencer! He is Wasim Ahmed Khan! We were following Wasim very closely. And when he asked you to leave the hotel... 'Hurry up!' - We sensed something was amiss. That's why I asked Yukti to leave too. But, unfortunately, we couldn't guess there would be a blast! Ananya, if only you were a bit more alert! You were so close to Rauf. And you could have given us all the information, but you didn't! I could have died, Ananya! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry! Sir, I'm very sorry! Please... I have to redeem myself. Give me another chance. Please! You know my truth. But they still think I'm a double-agent. Please, sir. Give me one last chance. Precisely this is what I was thinking. You made a mistake and they took advantage of it. It's our turn now. Rauf! Is this for me? Happy Diwali! My God! I missed you! I missed you more. This is the first copy of my first book. Just for you. Wonderful. Two kings! The queen lost again! I've always wondered what's the connection between playing cards and Diwali! Listen. When are we going to Mauritius? I'm sorry, Ananya. We'll have to postpone the plan by a few months. 'I can't bear to see you upset.' 'It is better that you take my life.' 'Before you do, come in my embrace.' 'Or this night I have with you might pass us by.' Believe me. Even I am sad. But... What? Zaid has disappeared. And I won't rest easy unless I avenge the blast. Where is he? I've heard he's gone towards the border. I was to leave today. But to be with you... You should leave soon. And return safely and at the earliest. Yes, my queen! 'Yes, I am in.' 'It's a Pandora's box.' 'How could we not see it before?' 'They are planning to hack into RBI to use our funds against us!' 'Do I have the permission now?' - Yes. Go ahead. 'Do whatever it takes.' Mom! Wait here. Don't look over there. 'Your memories made me restless.' 'You're here, or I'd have become really uneasy.' 'Only cowards uphold love by keeping their identities a secret.' 'Why don't we go far away from here where we can live together peacefully?' 'If I were to die at your hands, it would be a beautiful way to go.' Qadir! I wonder which son of a gun got him killed! 'Incomplete love stories demand vengeance.' We shall avenge Rauf's death. My code name shall be Mrs Kazmi.
