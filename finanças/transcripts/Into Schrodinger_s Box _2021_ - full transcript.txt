By email, if possible Yeah..sure e can take care of the cremation and post the ashes to the address in the will? Yeah Is there anyone else you'd like me to call? I'll call his son Thomas? I heard the news You can't have a funeral I know I don't think he would have minded no Sophia, my mom has a lawyer She is going to sue you What? For what?! As you know Martin sold the house last week He transferred all his money to my account No... I mean.. no.. I didn't know Mom thinks you wanted to kill him What the hell.. why would I do that? I know you had fights Why else would he take everything out of his name? I had an email from dad There are photos Why is everyone talking nonsense to me What photos? What email? Why would I kill him if I knew he.. transferred all the assets away? I know my mom's lawyer is after your corona test results Maybe you had that.. Maybe you have Corona.. Maybe you knew about it.. You know what? you didn't tell my dad.. You can go to hell like everyone else Do whatever you want You shouldn't be so close it's not safe If you've got it, I've got it I don't have my test results yet I can get it Hi, sorry to bother you Is this the Raul household?

Get some sleep, get some rest Good night, Sophia can you stay? um.. yeah I can stay Do you think Thomas was serious? I don't know If I'm being honest... I think it's Amber who is really after you you didn't give Martin Corona on purpose, did you? Of course not What the hell He wanted to leave you he did He told me all about it These filmmakers love to tell stories Who knows what he really wanted why would he lie about that? Sophia He couldn't help himself You know.. People think I'm crazy that I made you up but I'm starting to see that it was really Martin who lived in a fantasy world How did you two meet? um... On the set of Ambassadors one of my friends was working on it I was just hanging around We started talking It was a year ago, now At first he talked about you all the time all the time Sick, twisted even I know every single one of your tattoos can I? I'm sorry about that Sorry for what? Hurting you Can I see it? I'm sorry yes, Hi Sophia Raul I had corona test two days ago I'm calling to find out the result is it available?

But too formal You should try something more comfortable I love this one That was for a consert, it won't happen anymore now by the way you didn't did you.. you got your Corona result? It's okay Okay as in.. negative? or.. So weird after all of the things... you have to say goodbye How could he do this to me? Can you imagine? so suddenly I lost my husband, house, and probably all my money and the world is going crazy too maybe deep down you wanted this Maybe deep down some part of you really wanted him to die maybe Thomas is right Martin was a defeated man No one was investing in his films He thought the world was plotting against him He was a sick man, Lilith but he was famous too when.. no one believed he was sick He really did talk about you all the time all the time about the way you laugh the way you smile wait.. just wait you forgot one of the cameras, Lilly get back in living room and get that fram off the wall somthing you were wearing fell behind the bed go get it I can't find the keys In the drawer make up thing most importantly, don't miss the ashes she has done enough for me she is not gonna live long enough to notice Martin?! Is that Martin? Lilly?.. who are you talking to? Is Martin alive? Lilly.. Please answer the question Please tell me what's going on? Please don't leave me alone Lilly.. I beg you Lilly What's up Lilly? Is there a problem? Please.. open the door.. I can't Lilly.. what happened? call dropped.. hey.. You overdid it No one said you had to sleep with her noone was I supposed to be hit by a fucking fire pocker or left there Who knew she would have gone for the pocker You can't predict everything, gorgeous and improvisation is an essential skill for an actor That's some Gaspar Noe shit we got there I couldn't ruin this divine natural intervention without human intervention What if I died? Martin? Relax Sophia is not that strong and we had twenty cameras in there. anyways. Cameras don't save people If I... If I'd died, the police would have gone after Sophia, not you just another part of your divine fucking plan Hey.. are you okay?! one moment.. Hi... - Are we done here? - yeah - Good job - Thank you, Call me any time You make me sick I can't believe you did that to me Hah.. Sophia has fooled and charmed you too, I see Must be the kisses.. ayayay Fuck sake that is my body You are a pig You never understand that Alright, sorry! Is that what you want to hear? can you forget it now? We're done. We did it. It all worked! all you have to do is fall through the last step now Lilly you need to get everything and get out of the house I just can't Martin I just can't Let's just have fun out here for a couple of days I'll come home and pretend I found her corpse in the bathroom call the police to come take the body It's time for our honeymoon Lilith, you know it. that's horrible you are horrible Hey... It's time for us to live our lives Look at the glass half full, gorgeous You think I could have been able to get rid of her that easily? We never signed a prenup Now I have the house, I have the money, I have the life We're free! What more do you want? If I hadn't done this, if we didn't disappear you know what they would do to me You know what would happen to me Don't wait for me, Okay? Lilly Bye, Martin Lilith? Good morning Sophia I hope I didn't wake you up I'm not at home right now listen..

I finally understand now that you suffer from schizophrenia This can help us explain all the shadows and your friend Lillith You're full of shit I don't suffer from any schizophrenia If someone finds this out they can use this information against you Martin has hired you too It's all too obvious Get lost. No!
