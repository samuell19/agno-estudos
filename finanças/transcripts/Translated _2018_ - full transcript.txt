So this is Rome, huh? First time here. - [Clerk] Where you headed to? - Eugene, come from Idaho. Hey, what's the population here? - [Clerk] About 20 people. - Really? - Yeah. - You call yourself a Roman? - [Clerk] (laughs) No, we're not that uppity. - So why's it named Rome? - 100 years ago, when they put the post office in, those rock formations reminded the guy of the columns in Rome, Italy. - Makes sense. - Who's that old guy in the robe over there? - Heck if I know. I wonder where he came from? - Well, you just come off the hill, you had to see him. - No, I didn't. That's weird, how did I miss him? (Gravel crunching) (birds chirping) You okay? (Speaking in foreign language) Spanish, you speak English or Spanish? Anything? Okay, just follow me this way. Over here, over here, all right. Just come over here. Just stay there, just stay, all right. Just stay. Is there any place around here to take that old man? - Are you kiddin'? - Hey Stan, it's Tim. Hey, I found this old man out in the middle of the road in Rome, he needs to be taken to the shelter. Yeah, he seems harmless. Is it okay with you if I bring him back with me to Eugene. Yeah, all right, I'll be careful, thanks. You need something to eat, don't ya, okay. Had to get some air freshener. You wouldn't believe how much that old man stinks. - All that for him? - Yeah. - It's on me. - Thanks, it's gonna be a long ride. Just this way, just follow me, you're good, you're good. This is for a pleasant ride. You don't know what that means. It's okay, come on. Up, yes, there you go, there you go. You can hold onto this or that. Yep. (Groaning) We're gonna make it, yeah. - You act like you've never been in a truck before. Well I never thought I'd been doing this, but, I had to get away.

Well, ask and you shall receive. (Footsteps crunching) (bright music) (door knocking) - [Woman] It's the pizza! - Don't worry, babe, I'm sure the pizza will be here soon. - I'm sorry to bother you guys, but I got this homeless guy with me and I was just wondering-- - Yeah, that's cool and all, bro, but we don't throw toga parties here. And, we're not a charity house. - He stinks too. - Not as bad as when I found him, trust me. Anyway he doesn't speak any English and I don't know where he was from. I was about to take him to the mission and he saw your Greek letters and got excited. I think his sign is in Greek. I don't know, you want to take a look at it? - I wonder what it says. All right, you guys can come inside, but don't let him touch anything. - All right, thanks. (Birds chirping) - I got this app on my phone. Let me just take a picture of that really quick. - All right. - That's good. Okay. Hm. - Yeah, that's great. So what does it say? - "To me live Christ, die gain?" - That's a Bible verse from the book of Philippians. - Great, so homeless religious fanatic in Eugene. What else is new. - Ask him who he is. (Speaking in foreign language) - Hm, here. (Gentle music) Paul of Tarsus? Who's that? - The Apostle Paul, he wrote half of the Bible. I mean, the New Testament. - (Laughs) I don't think the mission's gonna be able to help this psycho. - We'll see. It's been a long day. Thank you very much for your help. - Mm-hm. - Good luck. (Phone ringing) - Yep. - Hey, Jalen, I'm back. Hey listen, I picked up this homeless guy out in Rome, in eastern Oregon. And he was wearing this sign around his neck that was in Greek, but he doesn't speak any English or Spanish. I guess he speaks Greek. Anyway, the crazy thing is, I actually found out he thinks he's the Apostle Paul. - Who? - You know, Paul, in the Bible. - Hilarious. He sounds crazy. So whatcha you gonna do with him? - Well, I was on my way to take him to the mission, but I decided, maybe I'll just bring him home with me for tonight. - Are you serious? - Come on, hey, he's like 70. All he's wearing is nothing but a dirty old robe. It's just for tonight. I think my mom's got her pastor's cell number, I can have her give it to me and I can give him a call tonight and see if he can meet with us tomorrow. He speaks Greek and at the very least he's got a counseling degree. This is above my pay scale. - All right, all right, but you owe me big time. - All right, thanks. All right. - [Announcer] Lawrence backed a pass, a heavy rush. He swings it out to Jackson on the right flank. But it didn't fool the Tigers. Derick Chandler came up to make the stop. (TV chattering) For the Wolves, or gives it to Royce Mattson, on another play and returns it to the 39 yard line. That'll be a little short of the first 100 yards. - What is he doing? Why is he acting like he never seen a TV before? - Well, he says he's from the 1st century. - [Announcer] A short punt, taking it to Tiger's 35 by Wallace and he's got some running room. Nielson back at quarterback in the spread for the Tigers. He fixes it to Spring, but he fumbles and the Wolves are right back. - [Jalen] Are you sure he's safe? - Yeah, I think so. He needs a shower now. - I could smell him from here, dude. - [Announcer] That fumble can only turn over the game for the Tigers, and now Ferguson takes the snap and gives it to Mattson. (Upbeat music) (water whooshing) (gentle music) - Well, he sure does play the role, doesn't he? - [Tim] Yeah, I can't figure him out. - Where you been? - Saint Vincent de Paul. - Well, that's appropriate. - Yeah, never thought of that. (Upbeat music) - [Dwight] Tim, have you met Rabbi Pearlman? - No, I haven't, it's nice to meet you. - [Dwight] And I assume this is Paul? - That's who he says he is. - [Art] You can just call me Art. - So, Art was intrigued by your mystery man comment. - You know, I don't speak Koine Greek but I can tell you, if you really want to test him, I think you should test him to see if he's fluent in Hebrew. - Hey, how you's all doin'? You gonna need a minute of two? - Yeah, a few, thanks. - All right, all right. Well, I got some things to do, I'll be back. That's good, okay. - You's do's, man, it's like he just walked out of that movie, what was it called with Travolta? - "Grease." I get all sorts, but nothing like this before. - Let's begin shall we? - Sure, let's begin. - What did he say? - I basically think he says, "I don't believe him." - Well, at least he's perceptive. Ask him to write something in Hebrew. - [Tim And Dwight] What did he say? - He said, "I shouldn't bear false witness. "I shouldn't lie." - (Laughs) A real comedian, quite the wit. - This reminds me of that old movie, what was it, "Miracle on 34th Street," where that old guys says he was Santa Claus. - Well this is no joke. - So, you's ready? - [Dwight] The usual, Jonathan. - I'll have a hamburger. What do you suggest? - I really like that bebopper, though I love that smoky bacon. - Jonathan, the rabbi doesn't eat pork products. - Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. - I tell you what, I'll just have a veggie burger. - Okay. - With fries. - Great choice. - And for you's two? - Make it two Wake up Little Suzie's with OJ, okay. - You's got it. - What were you gonna say about this being no joke? - I'm saying that the Hebrew that he's speaking is actually ancient Biblical Hebrew. It's not modern Hebrew. It's like the difference between Shakespeare's English and modern English. - Wow, this is getting more weird all the time. - What does he want to know? - He wants to know, what is the United States of America? And I said that I would explain to him later, it'd take some time. - He plays his role well. - Okay, he's saying that he wants to go back home, but there's a reason, a heavenly reason that he's here now. - I just had an idea. Since he actually believes and acts like he's the Apostle Paul, he should be pretty harmless. He can go on the road with me and just spend all that time learning English. I really want to see how this all works out. He's such a mystery. Besides I can keep a journal and write about this experience, depending on how it goes. - He says he wants to stay with you, but he wants to be able to work in order to pay you. - Tell him he can stay with me for free for a week and then I'll find him a job. (Gentle music) (speaking in foreign language) - Hey, what's up? - Let's go to my bedroom. - So this better be good, man. - You say one night, it been two, so I think his time's up. - I know, can't he stay for one week? - No, we don't have any room. - Listen, he'll stay with me on the road for most of it. And then if you still feel this way I promise you, I'll find him a different place. - Man, come on, what's gotten into you, man? - He's just such a mystery, I guess I want to solve it. - Yeah, anybody claiming to be who he's claiming must be a cuckoo in a tutu. - [Tim] But Paul seems sane at the same time. I want to see this through. - So now you're callin' him Paul, so now you're playin' into the insanity. - You got a better name? - All right, whatever. So you all are gonna be Monday, right? - Yes, bright and early. In the meantime, while Paul's watching these films, I got a meeting I gotta go to seek some advice. Do you want me to take him with me or are you okay with him for a while? - I'm okay, I guess, he's cool. You say he's safe. But he turns out to be a serial killer, my blood is on your hands. - Yeah, and you'll haunt me the rest of my life, I get it. - Mm-hm. - Amy, hi. - [Amy] Hey. - [Tim] It's good to see you. - It's good to see you too. How are you? - I'm great, thanks, you are doing very well for yourself. - [Amy] I try, it's a work in progress. - So, I bet you've never had a case like this before. - You'd be surprised. - So, what's the diagnosis? - Based on what you've told me, I believe he has what's called delusions of grandeur. It's a false belief, when someone believes with strong conviction that they are a celebrity, person of high rank or a powerful entity, despite evidence to the contrary. In your case, the Apostle Paul. - You're like an encyclopedia. - I boned up on it before you came over. - No, it's still very impressive. You were always great at cramming before exams. So, do you know what causes it or what treatment there is? - It could have been caused by a brain injury or drug misuse or PTSD. - Well, he's gonna be spending a week with me in my truck learning English, sleeping in my truck. Does that sound safe? Or am I being nuts? - Well, if you're anything like you were in college, I'd say you're still pretty crazy, but no, based on what you've told me and his age, I'd say he's pretty harmless. - Well, thank you very much, Amy. - Listen, if you're ever in the neighborhood and want to catch up more, give me a call. - Thank you, I just might do that. Thanks again. - You're more than welcome. - It was good to see you. - You too, don't be a stranger. - I won't, have a good day. - You too. (Upbeat music) (birds chirping) (engine puttering) - [Travis] Hey, I was just thinking about you and here you are. - Yeah, well I thought you and Mom might be wondering about me and Paul. - You mean your time traveler? Yeah, I was. - [Tim] Yeah, whatever, whoever. - Tim. - Hi. - Is that Paul in the car? - [Tim] Yeah, it is. - So are we gonna get to meet him? - [Tina] Yeah. - [Tim] You will, but I need to talk to the both of you first. - Ah, this sounds suspicious. - Well, it's just that Paul's been feeling bad about not working and me paying for his food and housing. He just, he really wants to work. - I see, don't tell me. You want him to work here. - Tim, we are not in the tent making business. - Tina, what are you talking about? - In the Bible, Paul was a tentmaker. But yes, it would be great if he worked here. He's been no problem at all. - Hm, Travis, what do you think? - I think we can give it a try. But if can't cut the mustard and he's too weird, he's gotta go. - (Laughs) Okay, that's a deal. (Gentle music) (bird squawking) (gentle music) - I like the sea, but not in it. Shipwreck, three times. I think you're a kind man. I have one question. - Yeah. - You believe in Yeshua? - I mean, I did. I mean, I once was sure. I was so in love with Jesus, Yeshua. - Why, what happened. - I'll explain it to you when you finish the course. (Birds squawking) (waves whooshing) (soft jazzy music) (door banging) - Hey, dude, you don't know first? - I didn't think I needed to knock to enter my own house. - I told you I had plans tonight. - Sorry, I forgot. - Amber, you remember Tim, Paul. - Yeah, I've heard lots about you guys. You know, it's getting late, I better get going. - Baby, I thought we was gonna sleep, I thought we was gonna spend the night. - Yeah, I better not. - Hey, whatever you want to do. - I'm glad you're not going to do that. - [Amber] Okay, see you all. (Door thuds) - Well, you know, Paul doesn't mince words. - [Jalen] Yeah, easy for you to say. Good night. - (Sighs) I do not want to make Jalen mad, but I'm glad he does no wrong. I like him. - Yeah, I know. A lot of people don't think having sex outside of marriage is immoral as long as you love the other person and you don't have more than one partner at a time. - Like the Corinthians. - Yeah, some things don't change, do they. But, it's not easy. When you're really attracted to someone. - I was wrong, Jalen is not a believer. - [Tim] What difference does that make? - [Paul] I can judge a believer, I cannot judge a non-believer. - Yeah, I'd guess he's not in the faith. So, what are you gonna do? (Door knocking) - I'm sorry, I was wrong to call you bad. It is only for God to judge. - Yeah, I accept your apology. But I wish you would have came to that conclusion a while ago. Plus, I can't stay mad at that face. You want to come play some video games? (Gentle music) (birds chirping) - [Waitress] Alrighty guys, here's your pizza for you. - Great, thank you. - Enjoy. - [Tim] Oh, thank you for ordering ahead. - Mm. - Pizza is great. Perfect timing. - How was the beach? - Windy as usual but sunny. - So what did you think of it? - I like the sea air, it is like home. - We've noticed that your English has really improved. - Thank you. Learning English is hard, but I ask the Lord's help. I am happy with progress. - Be sure to keep that accent, I like it. - So is he still doing good work for you guys? - He's a great worker, great attitude, no complaints. - Poor guy though, I mean, what's he gonna do after we let him go? - [Tim] I don't know. - Yep, he doesn't have a birth certificate, you know, he doesn't have a social security card. He doesn't want to collect welfare. - He's a real mystery. Tim, do you really think he's the Apostle Paul? - You know, I was just gonna ask you the same question. - He plays the part, but it's impossible. - Then what are his motives. - [Paul] I have a question. - Okay, fire away. - Fire? - I'm sorry. Ask, you can ask. - Those young people over there with the, we call them phone. - Yeah, cell phones. - Yes, they look at them all the time. They don't talk to each other. - That's one of my pet peeves, you know. I really think should limit the time on those things. - Travis thinks the world would be a perfect place if he were in charge. - Yeah, can't argue with that. (Tina laughing) (upbeat music) - I would like two things. - Okay. - I want to meet with the church of Eugene, I want to pray with the believers. - You mean, go to church. - I don't know what you mean, go to church, but I want to pray with the believers in Yeshua. - And the second. - The second is, I would like to meet the heads of the other religions. - Hindu, Islam, Buddhists. - Yes, I want to see what they believe. - Okay, first, I've got a couple of gifts for you. To help you and to celebrate for you learning English. So just give me one second. (Paul laughs) It's a flip phone. That way you can contact me whenever you need me. But I want you to promise me that you're not gonna turn into one of those teenagers and start using it all the time. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to take it away from you and cancel your service. (Paul laughing) - Thank you, very much. - I got something else too. So I think you're gonna find this very interesting. They're called Bibles. One is the Old Testament. And the other is the New Testament. And they're written in Hebrew, English and Greek. The Law and Prophets are in the Old Testament and you'll find some of the writings of Yeshua's followers in the New Testament. Like, Peter, John, Luke, James and even you. - Me, my writings? - [Tim] Didn't you write letters to churches? - Yes, but I wouldn't think they would still be here. - Yeah, I could see how that would be a surprise. And you know what, you're gonna find a lot of other surprises, including this one. - What, more? - So my mom and dad have spoken to me and they said that you were an incredible worker. And they were very sad to hear that I had to take you to the mission. So, they've offered to allow you to stay with them until the harvest is in. How's that sound? - That is wonderful, I will work. - I'll call them and let them know. So you still want to meet with the church of Eugene? - Yes, very much.

But I want to show you something first. This is where they hold the Olympic trials in America. Did you get to see the Olympics in Athens. - Oh yes, I saw many of the races. - So, the churches, do they all meet here? - No, that would be great though, wouldn't it. - When do they meet together. - Actually, they never really do. I mean, some do, but not very many. - They do not meet as one? This is very bad. You're telling me a joke? - No, I'm serious. - I wrote to those in Corinth about why Christ was divided. All this time, all this time and they haven't learned yet. - I'm sorry, and yes, it would make sense to meet a few times a year and I bet we can pack this stadium. Look, if you still want to, tomorrow, we can go to the Catholic church and then to the Protestant church, Pastor Reynolds' church. Many churches have two services. - [Paul] Yes, I would like that. (Gentle music) - The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, he took the bread, he gave thanks, and he broke it. He said, "This is my body which is broken for you. "Do this in remembrance of me." (Bell ringing) After supper, in the same way, he took the chalice, he gave thanks and he said, "This is the new covenant in my blood, "do this in remembrance of me." (Bell ringing) The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - I want to eat the bread and drink from the cup. - I'm sorry, but you're not allowed to. You haven't joined the Catholic church. - [Priest] The body of Christ. - But the man in the robe, he just read from what I wrote to the Corinthians. - I know but I don't think he's gonna believe you are who you say you are. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. (Traffic whooshing) - I do not understand. The man in front wears a robe, but the other men do not. And they call the man in front in the robe, father, but he has no wife. Peter and the other apostles, they had wives. - Well, yeah, I have a lot of there questions, also. But Catholics worship Jesus too and are very well-meaning. And all Christians agree that Mary was a virgin when Jesus was born. Okay, so do you still want to go to Dwight's church? - Yes, this is very interesting. - In Acts six, verse eight, it says, "Stephen, full of faith and power, "did great wonders and signs among the people." The only trouble was, the religious leaders got jealous and they killed Stephen and he became the first Christian martyr. The people that stoned Stephen laid their coats at the feet of a man named Saul of Tarsus, who later became the Apostle Paul. - I must tell them all that I'm sorry. - Not now, not now. - But I want to talk about Philip also, who's nickname was The Evangelist. He was instrumental in bringing an Ethiopian eunuch to the Gospel and when he was finished, God translated him to a city 140 miles away, in an instant. Although this message was primarily for Christians, Paul was drastically changed when he became a lover of Jesus rather than a hater. You, too, can have a personal relationship with Jesus. If I could have every head bowed and eyes closed. If you want to know this Jesus, please raise your hand and you too can know the Jesus that Stephen and Phillip and Paul looked for. Yes, see your hand, yes, yes, thank you. - Hey, thanks. - Good to see you, James. Thanks for coming, being here. - Yeah. - Hey. - Great to see you. - Thanks for coming. Good to see you, I've been meaning to call you. How's the English program going? - Good, thank you. - Yeah, he finished a couple days ago. - So you were able to understand the sermon. - Yes, but, I-- - When you spoke about Saul persecuting the church, Paul actually asked me if he could stand up and apologize to everyone. - I did see you both, but I didn't think about he, I mean you, Paul would react to that. - I don't think that's meant to be, what you say, a joke? - At least you must be happy that some people committed their life to Christ. - That when they raised their hand with their eyes closed? - Yes. - In my day, when a believer commit, commit, they would say loud they believed in Yeshua, they would be baptized and they would live their life for him, who on their behalf died and rose again. - Very good, II Corinthians 5:15. You must have been reading your Bible. - No, I lived it. - [Tim] Okay, well, don't want to take up too much of your time. Thank you so much. - Yes. All right, blessings on you, absolutely. (Gentle music) (people chattering) - I did not want to make Mr. Dwight unhappy. Are all meetings of believers like that? - Well, I've been to almost every kind and yeah, I'd say that's pretty much how they all are. - It was good, but I do not understand why so much time was spent on what God did before. More time should be spent on the good that God does now and pray over those things. - That's pretty common. I mean, I think there's a lot of people that want to know more about the here and now. - That why you no longer go to church? - That's part of it. I mean, I think they're all sincere and I do enjoy the worship. But money is a big issue and they all interpret parts of the Bible differently which is why you get so many different denominations. And there's a lot of the Bible that I don't understand or agree with, even some of what you wrote. - Something bad happened? You said at the sea, you'll tell me. - After Bible college, I became a youth pastor. And a little later I met this young woman, Brittany. We were engaged, and shortly after she, bone cancer. Two years. - She suffered much? - Constant agony. Why? Withering away? She was so sweet. And we prayed and we did everything and then I hear stories of people who were healed, miracles, why not her? It doesn't make any sense. - I'm very sorry. When something bad happens with me, I think of something good God has done for me. You must think of something good that God has done for you, now. - That's not gonna bring her back. (People chattering) (birds chirping) - Thanks again, Tim. Yeah, no problem. That was very thoughtful of you. Hey, let me know what Paul comes up with, okay. Take care. - What was that all about? - That was Tim Bennett. After church Paul came up and he was real critical about my salvation message. Tim was concerned that Paul might have offended me. - Did he? - At first, a little. But after I thought about it, Paul made some great points. As crazy as it is, he acts like I would think Paul from the Bible might act. - Aw, I can't get around that. That is inconceivable. - Yeah, I know. - What do you mean by Tim letting you know what Paul is up to? - Well, Tim just dropped Paul off at Spencer's View. He's confused about the body of Christ being divided and he's there seeking God's guidance. - Hm, that's interesting.

And how do you think he did that? - I don't know. But you must be my Silas and help me show them. - Silas, huh? (Scoffs) I know how that turned out. Beating and in prison. - I can only ask. - I don't know how I can help you. Let me sleep on it. - [Paul] Sleep on it? - Think about it overnight. Hey, remember when you told me to think about something wonderful God had done for me? - Yes. - I actually remembered something after watching those parents and kids in the park. - Tell me. - I was in Bible college and I was working in a store. I was on my break and I remember being confused on how I could possibly live the Christian life. And I thought that I'm supposed to love God with all my heart, mind, soul and strength but felt like, I didn't really feel that way and didn't know how I could be so passionate about it. I sat there thinking about how God is love and that according to what you wrote in I Corinthians 13, "Love is long suffering, kind, is not proud, "does not boast, does not seek its own." Then I substituted God for those words. God is kind, not selfish and so on. I meditated on those things for about five minutes, then it dawned on me that, God is like a good father. I thought about how when I was little, I called my father, Daddy. And then I remembered what you wrote about God being Abba, Father. Abba being Papa, or Daddy. I thought about it some more and a great feeling of love come over me as I realized, God was my Daddy. My break time was over but as I got up I was focused on one thought, I love Daddy. I swear that with my first step into the store, I saw before me a young father with a toddler in his stroller, and written on the little boy's shirt were the words, "I love my Daddy." I almost fell to my knees. I don't know why I haven't thought about that in a long time. - Yes, he is good, and nothing will ever separate us from his love. Even when a loved one suffers and dies. (Gentle music) - Father, God, Daddy. I know it's been a long time. I haven't wanted anything to do with you. I don't know if I'll ever understand about Brittany. And Paul. But please give me wisdom. Thanks. I love you, Daddy. - Did you think on my offer? - Offer? (Laughs) It sounds like I'll be more like a burnt offering. I guess I can help you. I'll try contacting the local media, you know, the TV and newspapers and such and I'll invite them to do a story about you. - That is good. You think they will? - I'll do my best to convince them. - Thank you, Tim. Now I want to visit the religious leaders and see what they think. (Bright music) Please, tell me something about the Hindu religion. - This is our Hindu, (speaking in foreign language), we worship here every day, morning. This is Lord Ganesha, who is the obstacles remover. This is divine mother, is three in one, she represents, music, goddess of knowledge, goddess of music and goddess of wealth. And this is Lord Shiva, who describe our negativity, ego and all the quality negative, thank you. - To me, Jesus is the image of the invisible God. Please, tell me what he is to you. - Jesus, well we call him Jesu in our language, he was a great soul, a spiritual teacher, a yogi, he came to this planet to teach us dogma, our duty and responsibility. (Bright music) - Tell me, please, what do you know of Jesus. - Jesus was an enlightened person, a wise teacher, a holy person. Even the (speaking in foreign language), that's one who dedicates their life to the service and betterment of others, but not divine. (Bright music) - [Paul] So tell me, please, what does Islam know of Jesus. - Well, Jesus is mentioned in the Koran over 100 times. We believe that he is a prophet, not the son of God or God himself. We believe that he was given the power by God to perform miracles on the earth. We believe that he was born of the Virgin Mary, and that he will return at the end of times to restore justice on the earth. (Mom laughing) - How did it go with the religious leaders. - Ah, I wanted to find out what they think about Yeshua. - And? (Paul sighs) - They don't believe he is who he says he is, they don't believe who his followers say he is and they don't believe who I say he is. It makes me very sad. - I could have told you that. - But with all due respect, Paul, what difference does it make whether they agree with you about Christ anyway? I mean, I think all religions are trying to be good people and all paths lead to God. - Yeshua came to me, as he did to Peter and showed that he was the Messiah, the true Son of God, who died and rose again on my behalf and for everyone. - You must have suffered a lot. I don't know how you made it through all those beatings and hunger and shipwreck and everything. What kept you going? - It was his truth and his love. Every day I feel his love and I want everyone to know his love. - Okay, Tim, what's next? - Well, Paul wants to meet with all the pastors here, so I'm gonna try to connect with the local media and see if they'll do a story about him. - Good luck with that. - Hey, thanks, Dad. Hi, I have a story I'm sure you'll be interested in. It's about an old man who says he's a time traveler. Oh, not interested, huh? Okay. Hello, this is Tim Bennett, I have a story you might be interested in. I picked up this hitchhiker who says he's the Apostle Paul. (Phone clicking) (engine revving) Hi, Tim here. - Hello Tim, this is Kayla Morgan from KESP TV. - Oh, is this about Paul? - Yes, I'd like to do a brief interview with him soon. - Well, I drive trucks so I won't be in town until the end of the week. - He can't do it sooner, without you? - No, he wants me there. - Hm, okay. I'll make it work. So, I can call you Friday? - Sure, sounds good. - Great, thanks, Tim. (Upbeat music) - Well, Kayla, it's time for our weekly "Out Of The Box" feature and today you had a very unusual interview that is way outside the box, to say the least. - Yes, I met with a local man who claims to be a time traveler. - Okay, and who does he say he is and where in time did he come from? - Believe it or not, he says that he's the Apostle Paul, a man who lived during the 1st century and wrote a great deal of the New Testament from the Christian Bible. Take a look. - This oughta be good. (Both laughing) - Yeah, (laughs) homeless religious fanatic's not all that rare nowadays. Are you saying you actually believe him? - Well, obviously not at first. But I've had him in my home now and on the road with me for three months and he's learned English and as amazing at it seems, nothing he has done or said has led me to believe his is a crackpot or an imposter. - Do you have any evidence that would support his claims? - Yes, he only spoke ancient Hebrew and Greek and he acted like he had never seen our technology. Now, if he is an actor, he could win an Oscar as far as I'm concerned. - (Laughs) Interesting. Now I hear that you're planning a meeting. What can you tell us about that? - I will speak, I will answer questions at this building. It is important that I speak to the Christians of Eugene, it is very important. - So what do you think? - I did get to meet with Paul for about 15 minutes and I'd have to agree with Mr. Bennett, he really is quite persuasive, even though it truly is unfathomable. - You think? (Both laughing) - I'd urge local ministers as well as the general public to come to the meeting. If nothing else, it should be very entertaining. - That sounds strange enough it might even entice me to attend. Goodnight and have a wonderful evening. (Upbeat music) - Thank you, Tim, for showing me this. - It's not a problem. I knew you'd want to see how it looks like on TV. - It's not easy to help me. - What do you mean? - People who see this on TV will think we're both crazy. - Yeah, that's true. But you know, I don't really care much what other people think. Thank you all for coming tonight. I'd like to introduce, Paul. (Audience applauding) - This is what I know. The Roman was about to cut off my head, the sword was ready. And suddenly, I'm in a strange place with many strange things. I thought Yeshua had returned. But I am here, I see many places of prayer, with many people, Catholic, Pentecostal, Baptist, Latino, black, white, but all apart. I prayed on this and I think that I am here to bring believers together. Are there any questions? - Why does God allow so much suffering, why doesn't he do something? - Ah, I was shown the movie, "The Passion of Christ." Do you know it? - Yeah, it was very violent, probably overdone. Mel Gibson seems to be obsessed with violence. What's that got to do with my question? - Everything. You want to know what God thinks about suffering? Look at the bloody tortured Yeshua. God hates it. He poured his anger on his only Son, and he, the sinless one is our only hope to get things right. And believe me, the violence in the movie was not overdone. Christians have a job to continue the works of Yeshua, to lessen suffering. - How the hell would you know if the violence is overdone or not. - Peter and John were there and they told me how it was. - You're nuts, Paul. - [Paul] Yes. - My question's for you, Tim. Have you had Paul's back examined? - No, I haven't, why? - Well, because in II Corinthians it tells us that Paul received 39 lashes five different times. And if that's true, he would have scars. I'd like to see 'em. - Well, I haven't seen his back, but I don't think that's appropriate at this time. - No, no, I want him to know the truth. - Good, let's see. (People gasping) (people chattering) - Assuming you are who you say are and that's a big assumption, why were you sent here to Eugene, Oregon of all places. - What do you think about the other religions like Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism. - Are you pro-choice or pro-life? - So when do you think the Rapture is going to happen? - So how do you intend on uniting Christians now? - That's why we are here, Tim. - Yes, for those of you who would like to follow in his work, please meet me on this side of the room where we can organize the meeting for all of our believers in our area. Now at this time, the media would like to speak to Paul and those of you who have any opinions on Paul. Thank you. - I commend you and Paul, or whoever he is, on this idea but I just don't get how this is gonna work. - Normally, yeah, the money issue does turn me off. But for a small offering to have this here four to five times a year, I think it would be absolutely perfect. - I love the vision of informing the body of Christ with what the Lord is doing right here and now and meeting as one no matter the denomination. I think with God's help, we can make it happen. - So I'll take down your emails so that we can start sharing ideas back and forth about where we'd like the event to take place and which local people we'd like to have testify and perform, sound good? - Great, sounds like a plan. - Great. - Great. - Hey, Kayla. - Paul, my daughter, she saw you on TV the other night and wanted to meet you. - I'm very pleased to meet you. What is your name? - [Mother] She can't hear you. She's deaf. But her name is Sophia. - Sophia, you must be very wise. Did you know your name, in Greek, means wisdom? - She did know that. - Ah, and why did you want to meet me? - She believes that you are in a close relationship with God and that if you touch her, she'll be healed. She wants to hear music. - You must have great faith. I think Yeshua wants you to hear. What is it that she wants to hear first? - She wants to hear her sister sing, "Over the Rainbow." What do I do? - Start singing. ♪ Somewhere over the rainbow ♪ Way up high - I mean, he looks and acts the part but the time travel thing, I just can't believe it. - Well, even if he isn't Paul, he might as well be, he's got a very good message. - I suspect that this Paul is trying to start a cult of his own. - He's saying that you're not telling the truth, you're a fake. - [Interviewee] Congregation with him. - That happens to me many times. - Well, some may think he's a fraud. But after the crowds left tonight, I stayed around and we taped something extraordinary. A young girl, who her mother says was deaf from birth, asked the man claiming to be Paul of the Bible, to pray for her to receive her hearing. - And Kayla, from what I'm hearing, we were the only news station that captured that incredible moment. - That's right. - Start singing. (Speaking in foreign language) ♪ Somewhere over the rainbow - Whether you believe him or not, Paul says he wants to unite Christians and is planning a meeting for all Christians in our area to meet and worship. The apparent healing of Sophia should peak a lot of interest. - That was incredible. - It was a real miracle. I'm so glad that Kayla stayed long enough to get that all recorded. - Tim, you like Kayla, don't you. - That's changing the subject. What makes you say that. - The way you look at her. - What? My man, Tim, you want my permission to ask her out? - Out, out, what? - He means a meeting, to go out on a date. - Date. - No, but that's very thoughtful of you, Jalen. You know what, I think it's time for me to take Paul back to my parents. I've got a long day tomorrow. Gotta wake up early, come on. ♪ Way up - Wow. - [Announcer] Do you really believe that that was a real miracle. - Amazing, I think we hit the mother lode. - What do you mean? (Upbeat music) - Mr. Powell? - Kayla, that was fantastic. - Thanks. - Yeah, I really think this story has legs. I need you to meet me at 8:00 a.m. sharp at this Paul guy's house. Text me his address. Great job, get some sleep. - But, Mr. Powell-- (phone clicks) (Kayla sighs) (Mr. Powell sighs) - Why so early? - Because I'm gonna be getting calls from all the networks. They're gonna want to talk to Paul. So we want to be the first ones there. - Go get 'em, honey. - All right, thanks. (Gentle music) (doorbell ringing) - Hey, I'm Kayla Morgan, from KESP TV. - Hey, you that reporter. You did an amazing story last night. - Yeah, sure was. Is Tim or Paul here? - Well, Tim hit the road earlier but Paul doesn't live here no more. - [Kayla] Oh, can you tell me where he does live? - Well, the people that he's with, I don't think they'd really want you to know. - I understand, but I'd really only like to speak with him just for a few minutes. - Is there a problem? - [Kayla] Jalen, this is Mr. Powell, KESP's manager. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Jalen believes that the people where Paul is staying would really value their privacy. - Privacy, huh? Well, Jalen, I'll tell ya, they're gonna be TV crews all up and down this street, lookin' for where Paul's stayin'. So you could really help us out by letting us be first in and we can avoid that whole circus. So we'd really love for you tell us where he's at. - I don't know. (Sighs) - Come on man, just tell us where he lives. Well Jalen, there's no way you're gonna be able to hide him. So, we really do need his address. Maybe this would help. - Well, I guess they're gonna find out where they at anyway. 580 Whitman Street. - All right, hey, thank you. - Bless you. - Thank you. (Engine puttering) - Do we really need to have the cameras rolling for this? - Absolutely, we don't know what might happen. (Door knocking) - [Kayla] Hi, I'm Kayla Morgan with KESP TV. - Yes, I saw you on the news last night. I don't want that camera on me. I suppose you're here to see Paul. - That would be great, yeah, it'll only take a minute. - How did you find him here? You know, I don't think I'm feeling very comfortable about this. - Mrs. Bennett, right. - Uh-huh. - David Powell, sorry to impose, but you're gonna have a lot of media here bothering you. They're gonna find out Paul's here. But, you know, we actually got the information from your son's roommate. So if you want to make all of this media frenzy go away, we'd love to have an exclusive with Paul. After all, we're the only station that really gave him any attention. - So what do you need from him? - Just need him to sign this agreement. It allows us to do some more stories on him and then we'll leave. I wish my son and my husband were here. (Sighs) Okay, I'll go get him. (Bright music) - Hello, Paul, I'm the general manager where Kayla works. - Oh, what can I do for you? - Last night was wonderful. A lot of people are excited. But there are also a lot of people that want to take your time and do interviews and things like that with you. So, I'm here to make this as painless as possible for you and Mr. And Mrs. Bennett. - Uh-huh. - Paul, this is an exclusive agreement. If you sign it, it will keep the others away and they won't be coming to Mrs. Bennett all day long trying to talk to you. - I think they're right. But I know you're not just here out of the goodness of your hearts, so what do you get out of this? - Well, we want to do a weekly show that features Paul so that everybody gets to know him. - Would Kayla be with me? - This is a big opportunity for Kayla. - I want to talk to Tim. - Okay. - Well, serious, this is a no-brainer. - No-brainer, no-brain, what is a no-brainer? - Don't worry, I've got Tim. Hi. - [Tim] Hi, Mom, what's up? - Yeah, the reporter and her boss and the cameraman are here at the house and they want Paul to sign an exclusive agreement. They say it'll stop the media circus. - [Tim] What? Put Kayla on please. - Yep. For you. - [Tim] What's going on? - Tim, I'm sorry, I'm just doing my job. If he signs the agreement it will keep the others away. - [Tim] Jalen must have told you, right? How did you ever get it out of him. Whatever, I just thought you were different. Can you put my Mom back on, please. - Tim, I was gonna call you. - [Tim] That would have been nice. - Hi. - [Tim] Mom, Paul wanted the publicity. But we weren't expecting this. Just have Paul sign the papers. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Sorry, guys, you're too late. We got an exclusive. (Door knocking) - I think this belongs to you. - What's this? - Me milkin' the system. - What? - Information has a price. - Oh, well, thanks. Here's a Ben Franklin, you're forgiven. - Are you sure, I mean, I don't want. Well, if you insist, then. Thank you. - Yeah. (Upbeat music) (phone buzzing) - Hello. - Tim, it's Kayla. I need to talk with you, you got a minute? - Okay. - Look, I'm sorry about what happened this morning. My boss called me after the late news last night and told me not to tell anyone about his plans, he was so obsessed about getting the exclusive. And I didn't know that you were gonna be gone or that Paul was living somewhere else. - Well, in that light, I guess I did overreact. I accept your apology. It was just a shock and I kind of feel responsible for looking out for Paul. So, what's gonna happen. - Well, I'm doing a weekly 30 minute interview with Paul. It'll be airing on the station for the next month. - Wow. That's probably gonna help Paul promote his big meeting he wants to have in a couple of weeks. - You know, I think what you've done with Paul is pretty admirable. - Really? You don't think I'm going over the deep end? - (Laughs) Well, I didn't say that. Thanks, Tim. Stay in touch. - Okay, goodnight. - [Kayla] Goodnight. (Phone rattling) (upbeat music) - So are you ever gonna ask out that hot reporter? - (Scoffs) Since when have you been interested in my dating habits. - I'm not, but truthfully, you know I got that gig on Friday and I really would love to have your support. - You're gonna pay me to laugh? - I'm gonna pay you if you don't. - Oh, that's pretty cocky. Oh, maybe I'll give her a call, we'll see. - Oh. - Oh. - [Both] I declare war. (Tim groans) (Jalen cheers) - Hello. Oh hi. - Sorry about the short notice on the meeting. I wanted to let you know that you both have done a great job of increasing our numbers here, Alex with the youth program. Gloria, fabulous job with special programs. I'm just concerned, we've got to keep our momentum going. - Is there something wrong, Pastor? - Well, KESP is giving that nut job, Paul, airtime on their television station. What a crock. - Yeah, I don't know what to think about it. - My only fear is the people will be following him around like a bunch of dumb sheep. - You mean, like the real Paul wrote. Where is it, about, "itching ears." - Exactly, I think we're talking about II Timothy 4, "For the time will come "when men will not put up with sound doctrine. "Instead, to suit their own desires "they will gather around them a great number of teachers "to say what their itching ears want to hear." - I agree, we might lose people in our congregation and that won't be good after all the hard work and time and effort we've put into it. - I wish there was something we could do to stop it. - I think there is something we can do. We may not be able to stop him in his tracks but we can sure slow him down. ♪ Found me ♪ 'Cause your love found me, oh ♪ ♪ And after all these years ♪ I've come to see ♪ That I don't have - You know, I've heard of this place, but I've never actually made it out. - Yeah, the music's good, atmosphere's awesome.

And well, long story short, she got terribly sick and within two years she died of cancer. So that's why I drive a truck. I just had to get away and be alone for a while. I mean, some people just look to rebound right away. - Tim, I'm so sorry. Hey. I'm honored you asked me out. - Thanks. You know, I see things more clearly now. - Like your faith. - Yeah, you know, like some things just don't make sense yet, I still believe. Even more so now. I mean, look at Paul, he's such a mind blow, right. - For sure. I fell in love with Jesus a few years ago, so, meeting Paul has been enlightening to say the least. - You know, I sensed something different about you. (Kayla laughing) Oh hey. - Sorry about that. - That's my roommate. - [Kayla] Should I go? - My name is Jalen. This is my first time doing comedy So I'll appreciate if you all don't laugh because ain't you so tired that you go to a f-in' movie and the writer writes a character that drops 100 f-bombs as if it's cool, or a teenagers or college kids using the f-bomb as a useless adjective. Like, don't get me wrong, I use a few select words here and there. But what I want to do tonight, I want to do the power of the Z. The Z-revolution. Think about it. The letter Z sits in the back of the alphabet all day, unappreciated, unused, lonely Z. And then what's next to Z? The irritatin' Y. The annoying, irritating letter Y. Y this, Y that, all day. And then what's next to the Y, the X. Now who wants to be next to the X? So this is what I'm askin' you. I'm asking all of you, next time you feel like saying f-you. Why don't you just zuck you. Or you feelin' like usin' the S word, say I don't give a zit. I mean all you all to join me in the revolution of the Z. Z, Z, Z, Z. Hey, this has been Jalen, you all been a good crowd. I respect ya, I love ya, thank you. (Audience applauding) - You are definitely insane. I guess you two have met? - What did you think? - You know, there's only one word that I can think of to describe all that. - What's that? - Zany. (Tim laughing) - She hit you with a zinger. - You all are perfect for each other. (Tim and Kayla laughing) (gentle music) - So, how 'bout those moves, huh? - (Laughs) You know, I tell you, when that music started, I don't know what came over me but I just, I got the urge to move. And I was so happy that I got you to move with me, 'cause that was really, really fun. - [Kayla] It was. - I can't tell you how amazing this night has been. It's probably been one of the best nights I've had in a long time. - Me too. I've been horse crazy for as long as I can remember. - I'd like to meet him. - I think I can arrange that. - [Tim] Yeah? - Yeah, I'll let him know you're coming. (Laughs) - Great. So should I call him horse or does he have a name? - His name's Shiloh. - Shiloh. Sounds like a happy horse. (Both laughing) So, do I really need you leading the horse while I'm riding it? - Yeah, you'll want it, at least for the first couple times. - All right, Shiloh, me and you, we go. - [Kayla] What? Heels down. - Heels down. - Just got the low center of gravity. - All right, Shiloh. - Yes, he's now going forward. You're just gonna squeeze with your heels and click. (Tongue clicking) Mm-hm, just like that. - Hey, what do you know. I'm a cowboy. So does Shiloh have another gear we can shift to? - You want to go a little faster? - Please. - Alrighty, hold on. (Upbeat music) Good boy. - That was fun. - Well, you did a good job. - Well, thank you. Now I'd like to see what you can do? - Well, I generally ride him bareback. - Oh really? - Mm-hm. - Well, please show me. (Dog barking) (Kayla moaning) Kayla, oh God! Kayla, are you okay? (Kayla laughing) You're laughing. This is a joke. Oh my God! - [Kayla] Tim, I'm fine. - No, I can't handle that. (Kayla laughing) Oh man. - Tim, where you going? - You scared the crap out of me. - Tim, I teach all my students how to fall, it's an important skill to have. - You're not training this cowboy, I'm done. (Laughing) Gotcha. Oh, you thought only you could play this game. (Moans) (Kayla laughing) (moans) Call the medic, call the medic. - [Kayla] Medic's here, what did you do, sir. - I think I broke my butt. - Well hop up. (Both laughing) And don't fall over. - My hero. - Oh. - So you're gonna teach me that stunt of falling off of horses? - You want to? - Sure. Fall off a fence. - Let's do it. - Right now. - You want to right now? I think, I think we need to relax for a bit. - I think I need to rest just butt and back. - And actually, I think I need to go find my horse. - Oh yeah, I guess we gotta do that. Do you remember the other night when you told me that your horse helped you with your father's passing? - Mm-hm. - What did you mean by that? - Shiloh here, he's heard all my problems and he never tries to fix them. I can remember so many times I'd sneak out my bedroom window, hop on him, look at the stars and laugh and cry and... That's all I needed. - Well, he's lucky to have you. (Birds chirping) (engine puttering) - Can you believe that guy? Taking 10 minutes to line up his chip. We're gonna be out here all day. - Yeah, they act like they're on the PGA tour or something. (Birds chirping) Man, did you see that putt, wow. - I tell you what, I'd like to get my ball and just knock it on the green and get 'em goin' a little bit. - That reminds me of a story. So this guy, Gus, he's out on the course and he's waiting around, just like we are and he says, "I never get to the green anyway, "I'm gonna go ahead and hit my ball." So he gets over, and of course he hits the best shot of his life. Takes one bounce, knocks out the guy that's putting. So he runs up there and he goes, "Oh my gosh, are you okay, are you okay?" And this guy comes to and he goes, "What were you thinking! "I'm a lawyer, I'm gonna sue you for $5 million." Gus goes, "I yelled fore!" And the lawyer goes, "I'll take it, I'll take it!" - Man, that's really good. (Men laughing) - Unbelievable, geez. Hey Dwight, I understand that you may be getting together with this nut who says he's the Apostle Paul for that unity event. Are you? - I've been giving it a lot of thought and prayer. I'm actually gonna emcee the event at Paul and Tim's request. - Are you serious? - I think even if the body of Christ gets together three or four times a year, it's a great idea. - Well, I was thinkin' about going, I'm just not sure I want to be a part. - Well, we're not going. They may say we're only getting together three or four times now but I think it's gonna lead to something more and we're worried about losing our congregation. - If it's not of God, it'll fizzle out. But I have a feeling that this could be something special. - Hey, I think they're done. Come on, Dwight, it's your shot, man. (Phone beeping) (phone ringing) - Hello, Officer Duncan. - This is Pastor Tennison. - Oh, how can I help you? - Actually, you can be a big help. - Oh, and how's that. - [Tennison] I think you can think of something. We need to get Paul and (murmuring) behind bars. - Do what, I was struggling. That was all confidential, it's over now. - Look, I'm not sure your wife will see it that way. It'll still be confidential, as long as you keep your end of the bargain. (Duncan sighs) (ominous music) - Is something wrong. - Oh no, I've seen you on TV, I'm Officer Duncan. I just wanted to meet you. - [Paul] Hello. - That's quite a Bible you have there. Mind if I take a look at it. Now, what were you doing over at the church? - I was inviting the leader to our event. - Paul, I'm shocked. - What is that? - It's methamphetamine, an illegal drug. - What? - I'm afraid I'm gonna have to put you under arrest. (Handcuffs clicking) (upbeat music) - In a strange twist of events, just one day before a planned faith gathering led by the man who has become known as the Apostle Paul, Paul was arrested and booked on charges of possession of meth. - Yes, everyone who knows Paul is in a state of unbelief. Paul is being held until legal action can be pursued next week. - What are you in for? - They say they found what is called meth in my Bible. - (Laughs) Are you serious? - Do I know you? - Maybe from a different life. - Why are you here? - Assault. - What is this, assault. - What? - Assault. (Fist thudding) I know this. I did this to Christians many, many years ago. I was on the way to do it to more Christians. It is said that Yeshua knocked me off my horse but I wasn't on a horse. - What, you're messing with my mind. - There's more. - Hello, everyone, I'm Pastor Reynolds. I believe the Father is smiling as he looks and sees us coming together as one, across denominational names. That the world would take notice and believe the Father sent the Son. I am disappointed because I thought we would fill this auditorium. Paul not being here has effected the turnout. But thank you all for coming. It took me a while to believe he is who he says he was. Paul, from the 1st century. So before we begin, let's pray for our brother, Paul, who is in jail, that justice might be done and that he might be released swiftly. (Dramatic music) We begin our unity event with a beautiful dance which demonstrates Psalm 133. "Behold how good and how pleasant it is "for the brethren to dwell together in unity."

(Tense music) - We serve a living God, one who leads us and guides us and even performs miracles. Here is the first of our many testimonies tonight. Thank you. Come on up. - As you saw a while ago on the news, my daughter, Sophie, who was born deaf believed that God would heal her through Paul. And here she is. - My life was good, and now it's awesome. I thank the Lord for his kindness to me. And I love to hear all the music. (Keys rattling) - [Duncan] Ray, pack it up, it's time to go. - Finally, about time. - Officer Barnhart, he's all yours. How are you, Paul. - I am confused. Why am I here? I did nothing wrong. - I know, I really messed up. - What do you mean? - I didn't want to arrest, but the man who made me do it knew I'd been cheating on my wife. (Crying) I do love my wife and I do need to make things right. And I need to let you go. And I need to face my consequences. - You are very brave. Let us pray, for you, for your wife and for your job here. Dear God. (Dramatic music) (door rattling) - Wow! Do you believe in prayer! Paul, Paul, come on up here. (Audience applauding) Look at that. (Microphone tapping) Yes. - I'm so happy to see you all here. Thank you for your prayers that set me free. (Audience applauding) I came to Eugene, I did not know why. And I was very, very sad to see that many Christians worship apart. I prayed and I know I'm here to bring you together. And here you all are, together. Do not be discouraged. There are enough of you here to change the world again. I want you to meet and to grow together as Christians. To fill that football stadium. (Audience cheering) Thank you and praise Yeshua. (Audience applauding) - Hey, I didn't know you were gonna be there. So what did you think? - It was pretty powerful. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, I think it's time for me to turn a new leaf on life. And drown the old man. - Wait, what are you talkin' about? What old man. - Myself, I'm talking about getting baptized. - Wow. That's great. - So, what you up to tomorrow. - Tomorrow, well, I'm gonna meet with Kayla. - Oh, so the plot thickens. - Like your soup. What is this, gravy you're making? - Whatever it is, it's the best.

And the best part is, I got to meet you. - Well, just goes to show, you help someone in need, the Lord will give you a big reward. - Wow, from humble to conceited in one second. (Kayla laughing) I mean, there's a lot of things I like about you, but I think by far my favorite, is your unpredictability. - Oh is it? - Yeah. (Laughing) - I think that's a pretty good trait. - Yeah, sure. - How 'bout you, you unpredictable? - I could be unpredictable. Sure. - Mm-hm. - Yeah, I got it in me. - You think. - I bet. - Yeah. - All right. - Absolutely. - I look forward to seein' (screams). - How 'bout right now. How 'bout I just jump over and make a wish. (Both laughing) - Tim, you remember how I told you about how I lost my dad? - [Tim] Yeah. - Well, one of my strongest memories with him is he always used to tell me that he saved his first kiss with Mom for the wedding day. It's always been a dream of mine to do the same. - Wow. Well, that's very honorable. So, can I get a high five? Will that work? Up top. - That'll work. - Five me. I'll take that. I will cherish this hand. - Will you. (Laughing) Thank you. (Water whooshing) (upbeat music) (Kayla screaming and laughing) ♪ I want to live like there's no tomorrow ♪ ♪ Like I'm on borrowed time ♪ It's good to be alive ♪ Yeah (upbeat music) ♪ All to Jesus I surrender ♪ All to him I freely give ♪ I will ever love and trust him ♪ ♪ In his presence daily live ♪ And I surrender all ♪ Oh, and I surrender all - I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. ♪ And all to thee, my blessed Savior ♪ (Jalen shouting) ♪ I surrender all (crowd cheering) - This has been a wonderful adventure. Last night I had a dream, I must return to Rome. So, my beautiful saints, I say goodbye. - [Woman] Aw. (Gentle music) (dramatic music) - [Tim] I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when Paul said, "In order to leave he needed to return to Rome." It was hard to say goodbye with so much left to do. But I was reminded, that's how the Lord left his followers so long ago. I watched him walking so purposefully. Stop, and then all of a sudden he was taken in a whirlwind. I just stood there in stunned silence. But why should I be stunned or expect anything less from this incredible man and our amazing God. I walked away knowing, that for me, the rest of my life will be devoted to fulfilling the desire of Paul and the Lord Jesus' heart, helping believers unite as one, using whatever talents I have. (Triumphant music) (gentle music) - [Customer] I'm really interested in this book. Could you sign it for me. - Yes, absolutely. - [Customer] Do you think you could sign it to my mother. - Sure. - Her name is Lois. I think she'll really, really appreciate it. And I'll get to read it too. - Great, well, thank you for your support. - Thank you, oh, you know what, I would really like to have a picture of you two, holding this book, would that be okay. - Sure. - Yeah. - Perfect.
