- Mom, just being here with you like this, I feel better already. - Ooh, what I would have given to hear that from you when you were 16! - Well, you handled the troubled teen pretty well. - Oooh, maybe it looked that way. I just remember it as controlled panic. - I don't know. It, maybe that's why I had to see you today. I mean, maybe that troubled teen is not far off. - What's the matter? - Nothing. It's complicated. - A man? - No, it's more than just a guy problem. It's connected on so many levels. I don't know how to get out. - Heather, what's going on? - Can we go for a coffee or something? - Mmm. - Let's just go and try Rolanda's. (tires screeching) (screams) (dramatic music) - Oh, my God!

Two bedrooms, two baths, 1700 square feet. Taxes and maintenance are under 20 a year. Jerry? Jerry, this is not a deal you think about. This is a deal you pounce on and grab with two hands. By the time this listing gets to the street, somebody else will already be moving in. Okay, I'll set up a viewing at 11. Bring your checkbook. All right, I think I've got a taker on 2527. - What took you so long? You've had that listing for a whole 45 minutes. - Oh, well, you're right, I'm slipping. - Well, before you slip any further, I have another listing for you. A gift. - Oh, I've heard that before. - No, seriously. How does a two-bedroom apartment at 107 East 70th sound? - Like I've already made the sale. - The woman selling is named Chantal Greco. The apartment is owned by her daughter, Heather. - The actress? Who was killed in the hit-and-run? - Mm-hmm. - I saw her in "The Tea Room," on Broadway last year. She was really great. - The mom says she wants to sell the apartment as soon as possible. So she'll be there for the next couple of hours. - I'm on my way. I'll check in after the inspection. And, Rick, thanks. - Yeah. For the queen of Manhattan real estate, anything. (car horn honking) - Thanks. - Ms. Farrell, back again. Not content until you sell every apartment in the building? - It's all part of the plan, Tim. I'm here to see Chantal Greco. She's thinking of selling. - Yeah, Penthouse Six. Nice woman, Mrs. Greco. Pity what happened to her daughter. I hope you can help her out. - Me, too. Thanks. - [Mrs. Greco] Thank you for coming by so quickly, Ms. Farrell. - No problem. I'm happy to help. It's a beautiful apartment. It's a shame you have to sell. - I didn't really want to. It's more my ex-husband's idea. He thinks I'm obsessing on our daughter's death. He thinks selling the apartment will be healthier for me. He thinks it'll help me forget. - I know it's something you'll never forget, but sometimes it is better to try to move on. - Maybe. If it had been an accident. But the truth of it is my daughter was murdered right in front of my very eyes. (dramatic orchestral music) How do I move on from that? - I'm sorry. I didn't know. - You wouldn't. Nobody believes them when I tell them. Not the police, not Heather's father. Nobody. - How can you be so sure? - He came up onto the sidewalk right at us. He wasn't out of control. He knew what he was doing. - But why? - I don't know. But something was going on with Heather. Something that scared her. She was going to tell me that day. She never got the chance. I found her journal this morning. And I've been reading it, trying to make some sense of it all. When I told Jimmy about it, he said I should burn the journal. Along with everything else. You think I'm crazy, too. - No, I don't think you're crazy. But I don't know how you'd ever prove what you believe. - Maybe Jimmy's right. Maybe it's best I sell this place. - [Lacey] Well, there's something I can help you with. (car horn beeps) - Hi! Aunt Lacey's here! - [Lacey] Hello! - Aunt Lacey! - Oh! (laughs) - I missed you so much last weekend! You didn't come for dinner! - I know, I was stuck at work. - You're always working. - Well, it sure feels that way, doesn't it? But I'm here now, so let's go find your mom. Kit, you should have seen this poor woman. She was so broken up. Like Mom after Dad died. - Poor thing. - Poor thing? Do you know who her ex-husband is? Jimmy Greco. Owns the Venezia Restaurant downtown and he's halfway home to getting his own casino license in Atlantic City. I mean, these people could buy and sell us. - Not everything's about money, Jay. - That's what people who have money say. - She lost her daughter. - Oh, and because we feel sorry for her, you're going to give her back your fees? (dramatic orchestral music) Money, money, money. - I'm so sorry about Jay. Ever since his business went off-- - It's okay. I know. Listen, I'll call you tomorrow. - Okay. - You aren't going to leave without saying good-bye? - Not on your life, kiddo. As a matter of fact, if mom doesn't mind, I was going to come up and tuck you in. - Be careful she doesn't rope you into reading a bedtime story. - I'll take my chances, come on, hop on. - Giddy-up! Just one story! Good night! (chuckling) (phone ringing) - Hi, this is Lacey. - Chantal Greco says you got along great. Says you filled her with confidence. - All part of the service. - Listen, I've got some more good news. I got a call from Keller, Roland and Smythe. They've got an executive being relocated to the city. He needs to find a place real fast. The Greco apartment fits his wish list, and price seems to be no object. - Great, do you have a name? - [Ryan] Curtis Caldwell. He's already set up to meet you there at 10 tomorrow. - A lot of people are apprehensive about moving to New York, but it's really not as scary as it seems. - This is nice. Lots of space. My wife would love it. What's the asking on this? - Well, they're asking 950, but they're looking to sell, so I think if you offer anything over 900, you might have a deal. And just wait until you see the bedroom. - [Chantal] Lacey? - Chantal? I didn't realize you were here. - My God, Lacey, she really was in trouble! (suspenseful orchestral music) - I'll bring back my client another time. - No, I think I've changed my mind. I'm not selling. - I'm sorry, did you hear? I don't know what to say. - It's a little confusing. - I'll try and get her to reconsider. - That'd be great. It's exactly what I'm looking for. - Now, this is something I never thought I'd see. Lacey Farrell talking about giving up a sale. - I don't know. Maybe Chantal really isn't ready to give up her memories of her daughter. Or maybe there really was more to Heather's death. - Oh no, not you, too. - You should have seen her with that journal. It was as if she was getting confirmation of everything she believed. - Lacey, you're not a psychologist. You're a real estate agent. - Hey, you should know that sometimes in this job you have to be part psychologist. (phone rings) All right, don't worry. I won't get too involved. - [Rick] Good. Now go and make that sale. (phones ring) (taps phone keypad) (phone ringing) - [Chantal] Hello. - Hello, Chantal, it's Lacey. I was wondering if you would reconsider selling the apartment. It's just that Mr. Caldwell was really excited when he saw the place, and-- - I've found something in the journal, and it's finally starting to make sense. I'm sure Heather was murdered now, and I don't know who to go to. Lacey, I need help. - Chantal, it's all right. Just sit tight. I'll come by as quickly as I can. (phone clicks in receiver) - [Heather] Sometimes I think he might just kill me just to keep me quiet. - Lacey? (dramatic music crescendos) (screams) (muffled shooting) (footsteps echo) (elevator bell rings) - Chantal! Chantal. Hold on, Chantal. (suspenseful orchestral music) Tell them to hurry, please. - Journal. Take it. Show Jimmy. Nobody else. Please, swear. - I swear, I swear. Okay, it's all right. Just hold on. Chantal? (all chattering) (siren wailing) Her ex-husband is Jimmy Greco. He owns the Venezia Restaurant. I don't know about any other family. - And you said that the last time you spoke to her, she was very concerned. - She said she knew something more about her daughter's death. Or why. - So she suggested that this fellow Caldwell was the killer. - She didn't get a chance to tell me who she suspected. - What else did she say? - Nothing. She said it was all in Heather's journal. I saw Caldwell run out with it. - And you have no idea what was in there? - Could I have a glass of water? I'm not feeling very well. - Sure. (mysterious music pulses) (singing in foreign language) - Mr. Counselor, enjoying the pescadora? Good. I'll be calling you. - Good. - Mrs. Molinaro, beautiful as always. The boys are treating you good? They're going to bring you a little something special afterwards. - Oh, how lovely. - Jimmy, there's a call. - Greco. - Yeah, Mr. Greco. I'm Detective Sloane. Something's happened. I'm afraid your wife's been hurt pretty bad. I'm gonna need you to come down to your daughter's apartment. - I'll be right down. - Thank you. (ominous orchestral music) (glass shatters) - It's pretty good. I think the eyes were further apart. (suspenseful orchestral music) Yeah, that's pretty good. - You were right, she knew. I know. Listen, we've got a few problems. The pages are missing. You think I don't know that? There's something else. The real estate woman, she saw me. Stop worrying, will you? I know what to do. I'll take care of her. It's my butt on the line. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Like I said, we do a lot of business with Keller, Roland and Smythe. That's why I didn't question it when the girl called to make the appointment. - Right, well, we've already called them, and they've never heard of anybody named Caldwell. And nobody from their office has called you in the past week. - I didn't dream the call, detective. Somebody knows we do business with them. - All right, well, if we have any more questions, I'll call you, Mr. Parker. Thanks for coming down. - Lacey, how're you doing? - It's like it's not real. It's like it's happening to somebody else. - Listen, if you need anything, you call me, okay? - Look, there's something we're gonna have to deal with. This was not a robbery. This guy was a pro. The only thing that screwed it up was your arrival. And you're the only one who can ID the killer. That worries me. - So what do I do now? - I don't know. For the short term, I'm gonna assign you some protection, and hopefully we'll be able to get him. - And if you can't? - Let's cross that bridge when we come to it, okay? See that she gets home, and have them call me when she arrives. - Sure. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Reporter] In a luxury apartment at 107 East 70th-- - Mom, Mom, come quick! Aunt Lacey is on TV! - [Reporter] Police would not comment on her involvement but say they are interviewing a witness. - Oh my God! - [Reporter] Victim Chantal Greco-- (phone rings) - Kit? - Honey, are you all right? - I'm fine, I'm fine. - I just saw you on TV. - I didn't see the news. - They said that there was a witness. Somebody who can identify the killer. Honey, were you the one who saw it? - It was, it was me. - Oh, my God. - You know, I'm fine. I'm fine, really. - I wanna come over, but Jay's not here, and-- - Stay where you are. Really, I'm fine. Kiss Bonnie for me. - I will. Take care. (mysterious music) (gasping) (water runs) (sobs) (buttons beep) (copier whirs) - [Steve] I'm very sorry. Mr. Greco isn't seeing anyone today. - I need to talk to him. - I understand, but I'm very sorry. - [Lacey] It's about his wife. (singing in foreign language) - Follow me. One moment. Jimmy, somebody here to talk to you about Chantal. - Okay. - Please. - Please take a seat. What do you have to tell me, Miss-- - Farrell, Lacey Farrell. I'm a real estate agent. I was selling Heather's apartment for Chantal. - I don't care about the apartment right now, Ms. Farrell. I thought this was about Chantal. - It is. I was with her when she died, when she was killed. She gave me a message. She said it was only for you. - Go on. - This is from Heather's journal. (suspenseful orchestral music) Chantal said she'd found proof that Heather was murdered. And that if you read that, you'll know who did it. - There's a lot of stuff that's blacked out here. - I'm sorry. It's her blood. Her last words to give these pages to you. - I thought she was crazy. But I guess I was the one who wasn't seeing things clearly. Thank you. Steve, get a cab for Ms. Farrell. And Steve, check her out. (suspenseful music) - Oh! (gasps) (breathing heavily) - [Sloane] I take these things very seriously. - I'm sorry that I didn't tell you before. But I promised her I'd get them to her husband. - Yeah, well if there's anything in these damn pages that's relevant to Chantal Greco's murder, you might have just provided our killer with some nice lead time to disappear. - I'm sorry. I promised. - You had no right to keep that promise. All right? I don't know how it works downtown, Ms. Farrell, but here, if you lie to me, the next real estate you're gonna be looking at is a door with bars on it. Now, is there anything else? - That's everything she gave me. - Sloane, you're not going to believe this. - Try me. - The guy who hit her was wearing gloves, but they must have ripped. He left a clean right index print on the doorknob of the apartment. - And you got a match? - That's the wacky part. The guy the print matches has been dead for two years. David Blake. Contract hitter. Supposedly died in a boat explosion two years ago. - Mm-hmm. Maybe somebody died in that explosion. But it wasn't David Blake. Is this the man who killed Chantal Greco? - He's different. - Of course. He's had some work done on his face, right after he faked his own death. Lacey, you are the only person who can identify him. Now, there'll be some changes in your lifestyle for a while, but our highest priority is going to be your safety. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Bonnie] Hey, Mom, Aunt Lacey's here! - [Lacey] Hey, come here! - Aunt Lacey! (gun firing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (gun firing) (grunting) - Oh, my God! (music cresendos) (sirens wail) (voices buzz over intercom) (phone rings) - [Woman] Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender. - How is she? - It was close, but she's okay. The doctor said she's gonna be fine. Kids heal fast, and they forget fast, too. Come on. She wants to see you. - I'll talk to you later, sweetie. - Aunt Lacey, I knew you'd come. - I had to make sure those doctors were taking care of you, right? - I'm okay, but my shoulder hurts. - Oh, baby. - It's not so bad. The doctor said he can make it so there wouldn't be a scar. But I don't want him to. I want to show my friends. - You might want to think twice about that. - Do you think they're going to keep me here for a long time? - Long enough for me to organize some ice cream runs. - Aunt Lacey, why did that bad person try to hurt you? - It's because of something I saw him do. He doesn't want me to help the police to catch him. - Are you going to help the police? - Of course. - They're going to catch him, aren't they? - Yes, Bonnie. They will. - Are you scared? - Only when I thought you were hurt. Don't worry about me. You just get better. We still have your birthday party to plan. - I'll be right back. (chattering over intercom) - Now we're all in the middle of this craziness. - Oh, Jay, I didn't think-- - Yeah, that's the problem, nobody thinks. - Stop it, Jay, you're being stupid. - Lacey, excuse me. There've been some new developments in the case. I'm gonna have to ask you to come with us. (phone rings) - I'll be right there. I'll call you. - Oh, okay. (phones ring) - Made a lot of waves at the Attorney General's office, Ms. Farrell. David Blake, the man you knew as Curtis Caldwell, was at the time of his supposed death number three on the FBI's Most Wanted list. He's currently number one on mine. And as the only person who can identify Blake's new face, that makes you a valuable witness. - I don't want to be a valuable witness. I just want to get on with my life, forget about all this. - Do you think Blake's gonna let you forget? Our suspicion is that he's killed 25 people in the last 10 years and I can promise you he'll have no qualms about making that 26. - What are you saying to me? - We've decided to put you in the Witness Protection program until such time as we apprehend David Blake. - You mean I'll have to leave town? - Leave everything and anything that can help Blake track you down and jeopardize my case. - Your case? I thought we were talking about my life. - Both happen to be the same issue at this point. - I'm not going anywhere. - Lacey, you have no choice. There's no way we can protect you 24 hours a day, if you stay here. - Where can you protect me? (dramatic orchestral music) - Lacey, I'm afraid this is going to have to stay here. There's no personal photos, no monogrammed clothing, nothing that would give away who you really are. Your life could depend on it. - Have you managed to figure out anything from Heather Greco's journal pages? - Not yet. The pages were covered in blood. We're trying to lift the stains now. - There must be something. - No. We interviewed everyone she was with, in the last few days. They were all cooperative, but they were all alibied. (sighing) Lacey, could I ask you something about your boss? - Rick? - Mm-hmm. - What about him? - Couple of things have been bugging me. He told you he got the call from the law firm, Keller, Roland and Smythe, about Caldwell wanting the apartment. - We do a lot of business with them, so-- - But who would know to use their name, or who would have an intimate knowledge of your company? - Maybe someone at Keller, Roland and Smythe. - Did Rick have anything to do with the Greco girl? - Not professionally. I can't believe Rick would be involved in this. - Lacey, somebody used you to get Caldwell into that apartment. (sighing) Look, for what it's worth, I'm gonna do my best to help you get your life back. - I don't know what's gonna be like without you around here. (crying) - Could you give me a moment? I'd just like to take a last look around. - Okay. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Lacey, there's no easy way for me to tell you what you're going to go through. You see, who you are is a product of everything that you do in your life on this planet. Friends, family, school, work, hobbies. But as of 24 hours ago, those don't exist anymore. Your continued survival rests on our ability to hide you so completely that the man who's hunting you, with whatever resources he may have, will not be able to find you. It also rests on your ability to dive into your new identity so fully that nobody you meet or come into contact with in your new life will notice anything to make them believe that you are not exactly who you say you are. So, from now on, when you see a reflection of Lacey Farrell in a store window or in a mirror, you have to look away because that's no longer you. It's like that old Jerry Vale song, "Pretend You Don't See Her." Now, do you think that you can do that, Lacey? - I don't know. - Well, I'd be pretty worried if you had answered any other way. Okay, let's get to work. Your name is Alice Carroll. You were born in Hartford, Connecticut, August 23rd, 1971. (camera clicks) Your mother's name was Sarah Amber King, and your father was Jordan Edgar Carroll. They both died in a car accident when you were 10 years old. You were raised by your aunt Theresa and lived at 615 Burton Street in downtown Hartford, and your high school and university were spent in boarding school in London, England. (opera music) (singing in foreign language) (light knocking at door) - Jimmy, it's almost five. We have the investor meeting tonight. - There was somebody she was scared of. But I can't figure out who it is. - Look, Jimmy, there is no easy way for me to say this. The investors are getting a little anxious. We got 30 mill on the line here. - I haven't lost sight of the business. That's something I never do. - I know. I just , I just feel what you're going through, and I just wish I could help you. - You wanna help me, Steve, you put the word out on the street. I wanna know who did this to my family. Let them know I'll be more than generous to whoever helps me out on this. - I'm on it. - And Steve? - Yeah? - I asked you to check out Lacey Farrell. I want to know everything you found out. I think there's a chance she knows more than she told me. Or told the cops. - Alice Carroll, 215 Burton Street, Hartford, Connecticut. 06, ugh. (mumbles) (knocking on door) (suspenseful orchestral music) (screaming) - Like they say, Miss, "You can run, but you can't hide." (gun firing) (dramatic orchestral music) (gasps) I told you not to worry. I've taken people out of Witness Protection before. The Feds think they've got it cooked, but people always give themselves away. Dumb creatures of habit. All right. (airplane roars) - [Woman] Southwest Airlines flight 207-20 is now at gate, approaching. Southwest Airlines flight 207-20. - How was the trip? - The usual. She's all yours now. Good luck, Alice. - [Svenson] Here. I'll take this. - Where are we going? - Name's Svenson. I'll be your contact here in Minneapolis. I'll help you get settled in your new life. - Is your name really Svenson? - You don't think I'd choose a name like that, do you? (dramatic orchestral music) Well, here we are. Home, sweet home. - You have to be kidding. (door clicking) - I'll let you get settled a day or two before we start trying to get you a job. Until you've got yourself settled, we've got you a regular allowance. I know it's not much. You're probably used to paying more than that for a pair of shoes. But the rent's covered and it's walking around money. - Is there anyone else here who knows? - Nobody. And anybody you meet from now on is only going to know you as Alice Carroll. Over the next couple of months, you're gonna find yourself becoming a pretty good liar. Every time somebody asks you about some aspect of Alice Carroll's life, you're going to come up with an answer. If there's a mythical boyfriend, think of a real guy you knew at one point, or wanted to be with, remembering details about that guy, the way he moves, talks, looks will help make your story more credible and consistent. - You seem to know a lot about lying. - Well, that's the job right now, Alice. Mine and yours. - What about my family? When can I call them? - I'll set up a secure connection once a week. Until then, you're on your own here, Alice. Try to enjoy it. I promise, the time will go smoother. (dramatic orchestral music) - Why did all this happen, Heather? Who killed you? Who stole my life from me? - [Heather] I guess this weekend was when I knew it was all over. I've had the feeling he was using me for a while, but now I'm sure of it. There were a bunch of us up at Stowe, skiing. Ginny, Joy Moore, Ken Lynch, Gary Kroll. Then afterwards he came up, wanting us to be alone. That was no more true than anything else he's ever said to me. - Okay, so who's "he"? - [Heather] Ginny and Gary came back to New York, and Ken had to come home for his radio show today. That's when I got a call from-- - Man? Manhattan? Someone she knows in town? What were they warning you about, Heather? - [Heather] Now that I know what I know about him, I'm even more afraid. He's angry that I won't see him and scared that I'll talk to my father. Sometimes I think he might just kill me just to keep me quiet. (siren wails) - Sloane, congratulate me on my hard work. - Well, usually I wait until I hear the results. (laughs) - I think your hunch on Rick Parker, Lacey's boss, might pan out. I've been running Parker's social contacts, and it turns out he was on the board of the Forbidden Theater Company. Heather Greco was a principal player in the troupe last season. Parker had to know her. - That's a long walk from what he told us last time around, isn't it? - Still, he wasn't mentioned in her journal. We'd have a hard time making a solid connection. - Well, maybe it's time for you and I to do a little detective work on Mr. Rick Parker. - Okay, here's the drill. This phone is connected to a bounce network. It'll go through five cities before it hits New York again. There's no way for anybody to trace where this call is coming from unless you tell them. - I understand. - Remember. No matter how close your sister is, no hints, no local references, the weather, nothing that would give away your location. - What am I supposed to tell her? The good news that I can't get a job because I don't have any references, or about all my friends? That I'm trying to break into a new city and not being able not to be truthful with any of them? - Alice, nobody said this was easy. Just try to hang in there. Remember, it's hard on them, too, so try to keep up a good front. I'll be right here, in case you need me. (phone beeps and dials) (line rings) - [Kit] Hello? - Kit? - Oh, Lacey, oh, my God. It's so good to hear your voice. - It's good to hear yours, too. - Are you okay? Do you have everything you need? - Yeah, everything except for you and Bonnie. It's tough, trying to keep myself together sometimes. It's all so weird. - For me, too. For the first time I feel so cut off from you. I don't know what you're experiencing. I don't even know what the weather's like where you are. - You know I can't tell you anything, Kit. - I know, it's just-- - I know. How's Bonnie? - Oh, she's right here, pulling the phone out of my hand. (laughs) - [Bonnie] Aunt Lacey? - Hi, kiddo, how's school? - It sucks. I miss you. - I miss you, too. I hope I don't have to be here too long. - You're still going to be back for my birthday, aren't you? - Oh, I wouldn't miss that! - Do you promise? (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh, Bonnie, I've gotta go now, okay? I'll try and call you next week? - Okay. I love you, Aunt Lacey. - I love you, too. Tell Mommy I'll call her later. Bye. - Bye. - Hel-- (dialtone drones) ♪ Pretend you don't see her, my heart ♪ ♪ Although she's coming our way ♪ (englne revs) ♪ Pretend you don't need her, my heart ♪ ♪ But smile and pretend to be gay ♪ - Thanks. - You're welcome. You thinking of buying a house? - No, I just like to keep up with local prices. - My boyfriend and me are thinking about buying on the east side. Maybe a condo or something. - A condo's okay for now, but if the market shifts, it won't hold its value. You'd be better off looking at St. Paul, Midway District. You can still find a three bedroom with property for under 100. - Wow, you sure sound like you know what you're talking about. Are you a real estate agent or something? - Me? No, my dad was. I guess it runs in the family. (laughs) - [Ken] Hi, this is Ken Lynch on your lunchtime show at WQUV. What do you think of this weather, folks? Isn't it great? Well, you better enjoy it while it lasts, 'cause you know what's coming. - [Heather] There were a bunch of us up at Stowe, skiing. Ginny, Joy Moore, Ken Lynch, Gary Kroll. Ginny and Gary came back to New York, and Ken had to come home for his radio show today. - [Ken] It's just around the corner, you know, and if you want to work up some body heat, then the best way to do it is to join me at the Twin Times Gym. Woah, that was a sneaky way to sneak in a sponsor's plug. - Excuse me. Do you know where the Twin Times Gym is? (phone rings) - Hello? - Mrs. Gray, my name is Jimmy Greco. We have never met. Your sister gave me something from my wife. I have spent hours trying to make sense of it, but I can't. - Lacey never discussed anything like that with me, Mr. Greco. - I see, but your sister might know something about what happened to my wife. Something she doesn't even realize is important, you know some clue as to who she suspected. - If you want me to tell you how to get in contact with her, I can't do that. I mean, even if I wanted to. - I see. But if you do hear from your sister, please, please tell her what I said. - Okay. - And by the way, would you and your husband like to have lunch with me tomorrow? - Oh, I don't know. - Well, just think about it. And let me know. - Okay. - Thank you. - Who was that? - That was Jimmy Greco. He wanted to get in touch with Lacey. - Guess he's not the only one. - He invited us to lunch tomorrow, but I don't know if we should go. - Are you kidding? Free meal at the owner's table? Sweetheart, we don't get to rub shoulders with people like that very much. And with his new casino opening, maybe he'll need some people who know what they're doing. Maybe all this trouble we got into lately can turn out to be profitable. (sighs) (ambulance siren wails) - No, no, thank you. No, I'll get back to you if I have any more questions. Oh, yeah. - Who was that? - That was Heather Greco's agent. Seems Heather was having some problems with contract negotiations, and it seemed to get better when she had a private dinner with one of the board members. - Let me guess. Rick Parker. - Found him very charming. - Did the agent say anything else about an ongoing relationship? - No, didn't say where it went from there, so maybe we should go ask Mr. Parker. - And on the lower level, you'll find the pool, whirlpool and the steam room. - Looks really well-equipped. I'm glad you have the free weights as well as the machines. - Any kind of work-out you want to do, Alice, you can do here. Can I ask how you found out about our club? - I was listening to WUQV, and the announcer was talking about it. - Ken Lynch. - Right. - Ken comes in every night at five, after his shift. And in case you're wondering, yes, he is as cute as he sounds. - Well, that sounds like I'll be here about five. - Great. - Where do I sign? - Here and here. - [Lacey] I joined a gym today. - Well, that's good. Do you feel better? - I feel like I'm doing something, anyway. - Lacey, I can't take much more of this, not knowing where you are. Every time I hear about an earthquake, a plane crash or a fire, I wonder if you're in it, I wonder if you're okay. - Kit, we've been through all this. - I know, I know, I know. You can't tell me where you're at. But can you at least give me a hint? - You realize anything I tell you could get me killed? - I won't breathe a word to anybody. (sighs) - You remember where Daddy did his basic training? I might be somewhere near there. (sighs) - Thank you. I won't say a word to anybody. I'll be thinking about you. - Me, too. Send my love to Bonnie. - Okay. (dramatic orchestral music) (phone beeping) (sighing) - You okay? - What do you want me to say, Svenson? No, I'm not okay. - Alice. - Don't call me that. I'm not Alice. My name is Lacey Farrell. Just because I happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I happened to see some monster kill Chantal Greco, you people have taken everything and everyone I ever cared about away from me. - Think about what you're saying. We didn't take those things away from you. - Oh, no? - It was David Blake. (sighing) - All I know is that I'm here, living in some rundown apartment, always alone, always scared, and he's out there on the street somewhere, free as a bird, and it makes me mad. Excuse me. Excuse me? Uh, sorry to bother you. Do you know how to set the timer on this? - Uh, you hit function twice to get to the time, and then you put in the time and hit enter. - These things get more complicated all the time. - Uh, you know what they say. To ere is human. To really screw up, you need a computer. Haven't seen you around here before. - Oh, I just joined. Name's Alice Carroll, and you? - Ken, Ken Lynch. - Well, thanks for your help, Ken Lynch. (singing in foreign language) - Okay, come on. We're already five minutes late. Let's go. - [Kit] Coming. - Well, Mr. Greco was very happy that you could make it. - Oh, are you kidding? We're happy to be here. - It seems like a very nice restaurant. - Well, thank you. - Oh, I'm so glad you could come. - [Kit] Hello. - Mrs. Gray, I'm pleased to meet you. Jimmy Greco. - Jay, nice to meet you. - Please make yourselves at home. - May I? - Thank you. - [Kit] Oh, that's fine, thank you. - [Jimmy] That'll be all, Carlo. Well, would you like to have a glass of wine or-- - [Kit] Yes, thank you. - We have a nice chateau briand, thanks. - [Jay] Thank you. (suspenseful orchestral music) (water splashes) - Yeah, I just arrived. Thanks for the lead. It'll be easy from here. People can change their names but not their habits. I'll check in tomorrow. (change drops) - Ken, right? - Right. Alice! - Right! Um, is this seat taken? - No, please. - Uh, would you like a drink? - Uh, carrot juice, please. - Carrot. So, how are you enjoying Minneapolis? - Oh, I love it. - Well, that's just because you moved in after black fly season and before winter. - Don't scare me off. The job market is doing that already. - Really? What kind of work do you do? - I worked billing in a pediatrician's office, but I'm looking to do something different. Thank you. All those forms. By the time I got home, I'd be filling out my shopping list in triplicate. - You know, somehow, I can't see you stuck in the back room of a doctor's office. You'd be great at something more social like, um, sales, maybe. - Maybe I'll give that a try. Thanks for the suggestion. - You're welcome. - The first thing I have to do is find my way around this town. - Well, actually I have another suggestion. I could give you the $2 tour and maybe we can even get something to eat, afterwards. - You know what? Minneapolis is looking more interesting all the time. (ominous orchestral music) - Do you have a moment? - Sure. - Thank you. I'm actually not here to buy a home. - Okay. - This is about my sister. Her name is Lacey. She left home a while ago. There was an argument with our mother, and you know how these things happen. - I guess I do. I've had a few tiffs with my mom, too. - Anyway, our mom passed away last month, and since Lacey worked in real estate back in New York, I've been making the rounds of the brokerages here, trying to find her. I just wanted to tell her. Thought maybe at least the two of us could make peace. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I haven't had anyone named Lacey apply for work here. I wish I could help you. - Now, the friends who told me she was moving to Minneapolis, they thought she might have changed her name. This is her. (suspenseful orchestral music) - I'm sorry, I wish I could help. Maybe, if you leave your number, if I see her, I could call you. - Bless you. (gentle piano music) - So, what made you choose Minneapolis, anyway? - I don't know, my mom and dad were gone, I don't have any brothers or sisters, and my aunt moved out West for the climate. Why Minneapolis? It wasn't Hartford, I guess. That's not much of a reason, is it? - Well, Hartford's loss is our gain. How'd you like what you saw today? - The Institute of Arts was fabulous. I'd seen prints of Gauguin's Tahitian Landscape but the colors of the real thing were so much more vivid! - Well, if you liked that, there's still the Weisman Museum to see, and the Nairobi Minneapolis. - What about theater? - They say there's something like 30 companies playing at any given time. Do you like theater? - I do. I made it to New York last year, to see "The Tea Room." I loved it. Did you see it? - Yes. Actually, I knew the actress, Heather Greco. I met her, anyway, through some mutual friends in the play. - Really? - Well, my cousin's an actress. - It's terrible what happened to her. Especially since they're saying her death was probably murder. - Who's saying it was murder? - Oh, it's just a rumor. You know how these things get around in the press. - Well, people should learn that rumors are dangerous. People can get hurt. - What was she like? (laughs) - I feel like I'm being interviewed on a talk show. (laughs) - We don't get to meet celebrities much, where I'm from. I guess I'm interested in the kind of people you know, what your life is like. (laughs) - If I'm a celebrity, then you really haven't been getting around much. (both laugh) But let's see what we can do about that. - Detective Sloane, please. - [Sloane] Hello. - Detective Sloane, it's Lacey Farrell. - Right, how're they treating you? - Fine, if you don't mind giving up absolutely everything in your life. Including all the little things. I never knew how important they were until they took them away from me. - I know, Lacey, I know. You don't deserve it. You were the victim. Now, you're the one who's suffering. Now, but, listen. We'll find this guy, and then we'll get you back here. All right? - I'm sorry to say this, but you're the only one I trust in this investigation, Sloane. I need somebody to help me. - What can I do? - Ken Lynch, the radio announcer in Heather's diary? What do you have on him? - Lacey, this is a police investigation. You can't just go butting around in it. You have to leave that to us and the Feds, all right? If this guy's involved, just imagine what he'll do to you. - Lacey Farrell is already dead. There's not much more that they can take away from me. - Lacey, please, for me, just stay out of it, all right? Our people have already questioned Ken Lynch, but I'll take another crack at him, myself, okay? - Try and find out who's behind all this, will you please? - Listen, it's my number one priority. (phone clicks in receiver) - I don't know. Ever since we went out together, I haven't been able to reach her. - Is there something we should know about your eating habits, Ken? (chuckles) - There's gotta be a way I can get in touch with her. Do you have her address or anything? - Actually, I don't. I thought it was strange, but when she signed up, she just gave a box number. - Listen, if she calls, ask her to call me, will you? - Sure. (sighing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (cellphone rings) - Yes? It's taking a little longer than I thought. She's smart enough to stay out of the real estate business, that's why. Don't worry, I'm already working another angle. (phone beeping) Excuse me. - Oh, Alice, Ken Lynch was looking for you. - Oh, I'll have to give him a call later. - Really? Because he said he was trying to reach you. - Well, nothing stays secret in here, does it? - If somebody turns down Ken Lynch, that's news. - I wouldn't want to hurt his reputation. (dog barks) (suspenseful orchestral music) (shrieks) - Alice, Alice! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. - What are you doing here? - You wouldn't return my calls. I followed you from the club. - You have to leave, Ken. - Why? Tell me what's going on. Why won't you talk to me? I thought something nice was starting. - Well, you thought wrong. I can't see you, Ken. - Alice, what's wrong? Are you seeing somebody? - That's none of your business. - Why all the damn secrecy? - Just leave me alone, please. (door slams) (emergency sirens wail) (car horn beeps) - I don't even know what I'm doing here. I told you everything I knew at the Greco apartment that night. - Maybe I'll tell you some stuff that I know that even you don't know. About your relationship with Heather Greco. - Relationship? - Mm-hmm. - I'd hardly call what I had with Heather Greco a relationship. - Oh, that's not what I've been hearing. - We went for dinner once. We talked business. - Why didn't you tell us that the night that Chantal was murdered? - Tell you what? That I knew Heather but didn't know Chantal? - All right, so you didn't know Chantal. But you meet the daughter, and a few months later, she's dead. And the mother just so happens to call you to sell her place. And then, the killer just so happens to call you to get into that place. I mean, what am I supposed to make of that? - It's all coincidence. - Oh, no, no, no. Coincidence is when things are not connected. As far as I'm concerned, there are too many connected things here for me not to believe that you're involved in something. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Either you arrest me, or let me go, detective. I'm not going to talk to you any further without a lawyer present. (machine beeps) - [Ken] Alice. - I'm sorry about last night, let me explain. - Don't bother, he explained everything. (dramatic music crescendos) (gasps) - Nowhere to hide, Lacey. (screams) (handgun fires) (screams) (gasps) - Hi. - [Blake] Hi. - Can I help you? - I hope so. I'm actually trying to find my sister. Her name is Lacey, and I believe she moved here a short while ago. Lacey had a fight with our mother and left the family. And our mom passed away last month. I'm looking for Lacey, trying to patch things up. She's a really physical girl. I'm sure she'd be joining a health club wherever she is, so, this is her. I'd really appreciate any help you could give me. - Gee, I'm really sorry, but I haven't seen her. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - I'll get back to you. - Okay. What was that all about? - Alice said she didn't have any brothers or sisters. (ominous music) - Like taking candy from a baby. (engine revs) - Alice, Alice! - What the hell are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. - Ken, just let it go. - You told me you didn't have any brothers or sisters. - What are you talking about? - I just saw your brother. Less than an hour ago, at the club. He was showing your picture around and asking questions about you. - My God. (lock clicks open) - What is it? What's going on? Why are you so afraid? - You should have stayed out of it, Ken. - He said your name was Lacey. - It is. - And he's your brother? - He's not my brother. He's a murderer. He killed Heather's mother. I saw him do it. I'm in Witness Protection, Ken. - What are you doing now? Who are you calling? - It's a beeper for a Federal Marshall. It's an emergency number. He'll know I'm in trouble. - Alice, Lacey, whatever. If the police know, then it's okay. We just need to sit tight and wait for them. - It's too late, he's here. He'll find me. - Just wait for the police. (shrieks) (handgun fires) (suspenseful orchestral music) (guns firing) (grunting) (gun firing) - Oh, my God! - I don't believe this. I don't believe any of this. - You've seen him. Now he's gonna be after you, too. - All right, how can I help? - Do you know who Heather's boyfriend was? - No. - She wrote that on the last night you were all in Stowe, she got a call from a boyfriend. You don't know who it was? - Yeah, there was a call, but it wasn't from the boyfriend. It was somebody warning her about the guy. - She didn't mention a name? - Uh, Holman or something like that. - Man, the word man was in there, somewhere? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so. Uh, Holman, uh, Hoffman. The guy's name was Hoffman. - Get yourself to the nearest police station. Tell them what's going on. Tell them to contact a cop named Sloane in New York. He'll explain everything. - Come on! Move it! - I need the next flight out to New York. No, wait, what do you have for Boston? - I have a flight leaving for Boston in 12 minutes. - That'll be fine. Thanks. (ominous orchestral music) Detective Sloane, please. (phone rings) - Hello. - Sloane, it's me. He shot at the Marshall, Marshall Svenson. - Yeah, I know. He's in the hospital, he'll be okay. Listen, you gotta get yourself to a police station. - No way. - How else are they gonna protect you? - They're all doing such a good job protecting me so far. - What are you gonna do? - I'm coming home. - All right, I'll meet ya. - I'll call you when I get in. (ominous orchestral music) - Lacey! Lacey! - That gives me what, like half an hour? Thank you, here. Excuse me. It's me. She's on the run. Her weak point's her family. Trust me, she's running home to New York. Yeah, I'll call you when I get in. (ominous orchestral music) Thank you. (techno music) - Lacey Farrell is on her way back to the city. Now, every minute she's on her own, she's a walking target for a professional killer. At the present, all we can do is cover her known contacts here in the city. These are composite photos of David Blake. He's been known to use disguises, so be cautious of anybody approaching the surveillance police. The file's here, hand out assignments. (officers murmur) Call me, huh? (car horn beeps) - Tim, I don't know how to thank you for this. - Ms. Farrell, it's nothing. Look, I heard what you went through after Mrs. Greco's murder. (sighing) You need to catch a break here. - You got that right, look at me. - Mr. Greco gave orders that no one was to show this apartment, ever since Mrs. Greco's death. Now, you should be safe here for a couple of weeks, at least. - Hopefully, what I have to do won't take that long. (sighing) - Are you sure you'll be all right? - I'll be fine, thank you. - Okay.

Where are you? - I can't tell you, and I can't talk for long. I found out something new about your wife and daughter's murders. - Go ahead, I'm listening. - It has something to do with a man called Hoffman. - John Hoffman worked for me at the restaurant for 20 years. He quit just after Heather's death. - I need to speak to him. - You can't, he's dead. (dramatic orchestral music) - Was he married? - His widow still lives at the same place. - Mr. Greco, I need the address. - Two Adams Place, and her name is Denise. Hello, hello? - What was all that about? - I don't know, I just know that Farrell girl got herself into more trouble than she can possibly know. - Thanks. - Thanks. (phone rings) - [Sloane] Detective Sloane. - Sloane? - Where are you? - Sloane, I think I'm on to something. - Where the hell are you? - I'm going to see someone who might know who Heather Greco was seeing at the time of her death. The man she was so afraid of. - Lacey, you're a target out there. Let us help you. - I have to do it this way. As soon as I get what I need, I'll call you. (dial tone humming) (dramatic orchestral music) - Yeah, I just received a call on this line. I need the location of the caller. Yeah, I think it was a pay phone. All right, thank you. Come on, we're on the move! (knocking on door) (locks click) - Can I help you? - Mrs. Hoffman, my name is Lacey Farrell. - Yes, what's this about? - I need to talk to you about your husband and Heather Greco. - I have nothing to say to you. - Please, Mrs. Hoffman, I don't mean you any harm. I just need some information. - I don't know anything. I don't want to know anything. You have to go. - I have nowhere to go. Someone is trying to kill me. And I think it's the same person who killed Heather and Chantal Greco. - They killed my husband, too. All because of the Grecos. I don't wanna die. - This has to stop, and I think you are the person who can make it stop. Please, help me. (lock clicks) - Come in and sit down. (suspenseful orchestral music) John worked as the maitre d' for Jimmy Greco for over 20 years. He loved Jimmy like a brother and Heather Greco like she was his own daughter. - What happened? - Business was changing. John felt that, with Jimmy trying to get the casino off of the ground, he was losing sight of the restaurant, and also felt that Jimmy was getting himself involved with the wrong crowd. - Who, his investors? - I don't know, John wouldn't tell me. All he said was to keep my mouth shut and stay out of it. He said whoever it was was too dangerous. (suspenseful orchestral music) (car screeches) - Yeah, this is it! There's a lot of houses here. We can't cover all of them. - All right, I'll call for backup. We'll canvas the whole neighborhood. - Please think. Is there anything else your husband mentioned about this man? - Nothing, just that it was someone close to Jimmy, the last person Jimmy would ever suspect. - My God, it all makes sense. It's why Heather kept the relationship a secret. Excuse me, I need to use your phone. (gasping) (clattering) Is there anyone else living here? (Mrs. Hoffman screams) (suspenseful orchestral music) (gun firing) (screams) - Run! (gun clatters) Nah, nah, nah! - [Sloane] Don't make this hard on yourself. Give it to me. - Get up! (shouts) Let's go! Come on. Move it, Blake. - It's all over now. - It's not over, Sloane, not yet. (lock clicks) - All this time, I didn't even think you knew the combination. You know the funny thing, Steve. I would have given you anything you wanted, anything. You didn't have to kill my little girl for it. (laughs) - Jimmy, you got it all wrong. I was just coming up for a file. I noticed the safe was open. I was just making sure the receipts were all right, that's all. - Don't waste a breath. I just got a call from the Farrell girl. She told me it was you. I didn't want to believe it. But then I called the partners in Atlantic City. They said they'd given advances they'd never gotten receipts for. They told me you handled the transactions and told them that I was too busy to deal with it. - You were too busy, Jimmy. You're always too busy. I carried the ball for you, like always. - Heather, and John, Chantal. How many more would you have killed, Steve? You gonna kill me next? - I'm outta here. (suspenseful orchestral music) (grunting) (grunting) - Enough! (sirens wail) (peaceful piano music) Well, here we are, door to door. How's that for service? - I'm home, I'm really home. (sighing) I can hardly believe it's over. I can hardly believe I have my life back. - Well, it wouldn't've happened if you hadn't put the pieces together. - I guess, I just, I just keep thinking about Blake. He never would've given up coming after me, would he? - No, no, no, guys like him don't stop till the job is done. - Do you think they'll put him away forever? (sighs) What? - Baldwin's already made a deal with him. Everything he knows about Steve Smith and his connections in Atlantic City, in exchange for a trip through the Witness Protection program. - Great. Do you think they'll give him my old apartment? - For guys like Baldwin, the whole thing is a deal. You know it's just another step to the Governor's office. How about you? You gonna go back into real estate, or-- - I guess so, it's what I do, it's what I'm good at. But I was thinking I might make a trip to Minneapolis. See how Marshall Svenson is doing. - Oh, he's doing great, doing great. Thanks to that bullet-proof vest. - Oh, thank goodness. And there are a few people there who I'd like to meet all over again. As Lacey Farrell, this time. Thank you. Thank you, Sloane for never giving up on me. - Oh, come on, all in a day's work. No, that's all right. I know the way out. (light orchestral music) (sighs) (light orchestral music) (all chattering) - [Kit] What is that? - [Bonnie] Mom, mom, look what I got? It looks so cool. - Oh, my goodness.
