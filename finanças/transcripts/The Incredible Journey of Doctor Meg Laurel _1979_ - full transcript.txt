[♪♪♪] [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [♪♪♪] Meg, you have to get into bed now. You are sick, Meg. You're very sick. MAN: $50. I can give you $10 now and the rest at $3 a week. It's gotta be $50 now. Please, these are just children. Don't you be afeard, Meg. Granny Bacon's come to Little Oak from the Appalachian Mountains. She can cure you. She has ways. This is the onliest thing I know to do. Look, I'm sorry. [♪♪♪] [MEG SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] Meg, sweetheart, look at me. I'm okay. Thom... Mm-hmm. It's all right, it's over. It's over. Okay, okay. Is it the same one? Yes, it's always the same one. Honey, it always starts out so nice. You know, I'm dreaming about the good times and then-- All of a sudden I start hearing the crying, and I see those little girls, and I see that Granny and her knife and that pot of blood. You know, the look on her eyes when she grabs my arm. It's just terrible. I know, darling, I know. I know. Meg. You have to keep all this in its proper perspective. As horrible as it was, it served a purpose in your life. It made you wanna become a doctor. And I saw you fight your way through med school with more determination than anyone I've ever met. Including me, and it's going so... That old lady's ignorance pushed you. Oh, you remembered the eggs. They're probably cold. [CHUCKLES] What's the matter? Let me see what that says. No, no, no, darling. Allow me. "Dr. Meg Laurel blasted Judge Adamson. "Saying that by allowing the docks to deteriorate "with total disregard for human life, he has elected himself murderer from 10 of Boston." Murderer? Honey, don't you know, you don't say things like that in the press. Honey, there were reporters everywhere. Everyone was saying things, and I didn't say anything that I don't believe. Don't you know the power that Adamson wheels? One word from him and neither one of us will ever practice medicine in Boston again. But Boston isn't the world. Plenty of places need doctors. A lot more than they do here. Like an orphanage in Virginia. Well, that's fine for you, but I wanna work in Boston. Thom, I did not do it on purpose. However, if it gets Adamson to change things, I'm glad it happened no matter what the consequences. You could have gone to him in private. I have been to him in private, and you know that! I took him those photographs of the garbage and the rats down there. He says to me that tough men get tougher working under those conditions. Meg, you're gonna have to apologize to Adamson. No. Do we have to be sick and poor before you really care what happens to us? Thom, please, don't ask me to do this. What difference does it make? There's principle involved. To hell with your principles! You do not have to say you're wrong. All you have to say is that you're sorry. If you want to sacrifice your career for your beliefs, fine. But, please, do not ever sacrifice mine. Meg, darling. I respect what you did, but-- Enough. No more, okay? Just tell me where and when and I will say whatever you want me to say. But it has to be in private. I promise, it will be in total privacy. I'll set it up for tonight. Man, in this case woman, is an unjust creature. God in heaven is just, justice will ultimately triumph. [CHUCKLES] [DOORBELL RINGS] Good evening, Dr. Laurel. Good evening, Douglas. This is my wife, also Dr. Laurel. Good evening. Judge Adamson is expecting you. He's in the salon. I knew nothing about this. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] She looks harmless enough, doesn't she? Thom, let's leave, please-- Meg, just do it and it will be over. Thom. Your Honor. Dr. Laurel, it was so gracious of you to offer to come tonight. Now, tell me, who do I look like? Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney? [ALL LAUGH] Come. Now, everybody, ladies-- Ladies and gentlemen. I think all of you here know Dr. Thom Laurel. Well, this is his pretty wife, Dr. Margaret Laurel. And I think she has something to say. Judge Adamson, I came here tonight-- Yes? I can't do this, Thom. I can't do this. Meg. Judge Adamson, I speak to you for myself, not as my husband's wife. I came here tonight prepared to apologize to you, but I find that I cannot. Because you, sir, are an epidemic on this city. And the disease that comes from you is killing people. Yet somehow, you have remained immune to its horrors. And I just pray that there is some trace of human that's left in you. So that you will understand that people come before profit. And human life before your own self-righteousness. [♪♪♪] I wanna talk to you. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Well, you're the hero and I'm the victim. Thom, before you say anything, I want you to know that I love you very much. And I know that you had nothing to do with all with tonight. It's where I belong, you know. This is the first penny that they ever raised for me. The rest of them helped send me to medical school. I'd like to take this one back to Effie and the children. Meg, I-- Wait a minute. Please, listen to me. Thom, I never knew I was going to be loved by someone as wonderful as you. All right, Meg. You are wonderful, Thom. You are. But you know what you want. It's right and it's good. I don't. Meg, we can work this out. No. We'll both be better off this way. [♪♪♪] That look. It's the same look you had the first time I ever saw you. There's no way I can ever change your mind, is there? Come with me. What? Come with me, Thom. There's so much good to be done, and they need doctors like you. Oh, no, Meg. No. You go. And if you wanna come back here, fine. I'll be here. [♪♪♪] [MOTOR ENGINE RUNNING] [SOBS] [CHUCKLES] Well? I know. You got enough medical supplies to open a hospital. So, what do you think? A month? Year? Oh, Thom. I'm so scared. I'm scared too, baby. I love you so much. And I love you too. Meg, I can't let you go. Oh, Thom, no. Don't do this, please. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Wait a moment, please. [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] [♪♪♪] What you doing there? Joe. Joe, it's Meg. Little Meg. Oh, well, I'll be. Little Meg. Why, why, look at the woman you've become. Like a rainbow and a pot of gold all rolled up together. Oh, and you're still the sweet talker you always were. I'm so glad to see you. What you doing here? Effie said you settled down and married. Well, I did, but-- I don't wanna talk about me. I'd like to know about Effie and the girls. If you'd come a few months earlier, Effie would have lit up to see you. You was always her favorite. She's not-- No, no, no. The orphanage just ran out of money. She's gone back up in the Appalachia's. Back to Eagle's Nest. I just kind of stay around and see no one disturbs nothing. Well, I should have come back sooner. I knew it. Little Meg, a doctor. Hmm. Yes, yes. [BOTH LAUGH] Effie would have lit up to see you. How do you get there? To Eagle's Nest, I mean. Oh, that's a-- That's a tough place to get to. Tough place. Nobody goes there except people who was born there. Wasn't that Granny who came down when we were all sick? Wasn't she from up there? Yeah, oh, roundabouts there. Can I get there with a wagon? I brought all my medical supplies here. They got folk ways. They won't take to your bringing medicine. Going to see Effie is one thing, but you aiming to be a doctor up there... Can I get there with a wagon? If you are really determined, tomorrow we'll get you outfitted. There's a lot you'll need, including a shotgun. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [HORSE SNORTS] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [TWIG BREAKS] [LEAVES RUSTLING] I've got a gun. Don't you move. I'll shoot you. Don't pitch a fit now. No need to empty that gun. I'm friendly-like. Step out here in the open. I see'd you working with that there pot. I'd help you set it rightly over the fire for a share of what's in it. I don't share my food with people who sneak up on me in the night. Well, ain't no doors to knock on out here. And I don't appreciate being followed. I weren't following you. Not unless you... you come down from Eagle's Nest in front of me. You're from Eagle's Nest? I was birth there. I mean, I was born there. What's the name of the woman who used to run the orphanage? You mean Effie Webb? Well, she's a neighbor lady. You know her? Yes, I do. Well, folkses up in Eagle's Nest, by my minder. Dumbing up their lives with ignorance. All they know to do with a book is press flower petals twixt its pages. Now me, I've been reading since I was only 16. You've never been down this mountain? No. But I'm pushing myself all the way out this time. I ain't never ever going so much as to look at these here mountains again. You'd best be stirring that. Are you afraid? Well, no, but burnt stew ain't no fun to eat. I'm talking about being afraid of going somewhere you've never been before. Well, I weren't afeard of being birthed. Darn it. Born, born, born. I weren't afeard of being born to where I'd never been before. So no use in starting now. You, uh, a government worker? No, I'm a doctor. Oh. Oh, well. They already got a curer up in Eagle's Nest. Granny Arrowroot. I'm talking about a real doctor. Not someone who boils roots or uses unsterilized knives. I think this is ready. [♪♪♪] [GASPS] Jacob Barth, if you so much-- I'm no shag nasty, honest. I-I-I just... I just wanted to see if it was soft as it looked. If you wanna feel hair, you touch your chin. Go on back over there. But-- But beard hair ain't like your hair. Touch it. I don't mind. No, thank you. I-I-I don't really like beards to begin with. Please. [♪♪♪] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [♪♪♪] [GROWLING] [ROARS] [BRAYS] [♪♪♪] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Come on! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! [♪♪♪] Oh! [GROWLING] [BRAYING] [SCREAMS] Ho, ho, hey! Ho, ho, ho. Ho, up there. Slow down. Ho, ho, ho. That's better. [♪♪♪] Come on, come on. MEG: But I managed to save most of my things. I'm hoping to reach Effie's tomorrow sometime. I am really looking forward to sleeping in an actual bed. I'll write again as soon as I'm settled in. All my love, Meg. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [HARMONICA PLAYING] Ho, ho! Ho, ho. [HARMONICA PLAYING] Hello. Wait, don't go. Please don't be afraid. Sorry I frightened your friend. I'm glad you didn't run away. My name is Meg. What's yours? I know a riddle. You do? Wanna see if I can guess it? Three fourths of a cross, a circle complete, a brass standing where two semi-circles do meet. Right triangle standing on its own two feet. Two semi-circles, and the circle complete. Spells what? Well, I know it spells something. But, uh, don't know exactly what. You got me. I hope you're gonna tell me. Three fourths of a cross, T. A circle complete, O. A brass standing which semi-circles do meet, B. A right triangle standing, on its own two feet. A. Two semi-circles, C-C. And a circle complete. Tobacco. Honey, that's the best riddle I've ever heard. I've got a riddle now. What's in that? What's the name of this person standing in front of me? Laurie Mae Moon! And my brother is Joshua Moon. And my Pa is Mr. Harley Cuddle Moon. And my ma was Lauren Moon before she illed up and got took into heaven. Are them store-bought? Yes, they are. Laurie Mae-- Can't confidence with you no more. If them store-bought, that makes you an outlander, and an unwelcomer. I'd have the hickory laid on me for sure. You mean you can't even talk to me? Well, Laurie, I maybe, uh, an outlander, but I'm not an unwelcomer. I'm a very good friend of Effie Webb's. Does she live around here somewhere? Good. [PLAYS HARMONICA] [CARAVAN RUMBLES] Laurie Mae. Get down off from there. Inside, girl. I didn't jab with her none. I swear! Inside! I told you once. Mr. Moon, please don't be upset with Laurie Mae. Just keep your butt up in that saddle. You toting papers? I don't know what you mean. Papers, warrants. No. Mr. Moon, listen, I've come an awful long way. I'm looking for-- Don't you be a-storying me. And don't you keep interrupting me. I'll do just as I please on my own property. Hyah! Get out of here! Go on. Hyah! Get out of here! Go on! Get out of here! Hyah! [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hey, hey. [TONGUE CLICKS] Hey! Hoo. Hoo. Effie? Effie? [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Effie. Effie. What are you doing to her? Effie, it's Meg. It's me, Meg. Would you get that away from her? Effie? What is it? What's wrong? Meg! [GASPS] My darling Meg! Oh, Effie, I'll take care of you. I promise, I will. WOMAN: There ain't nothing you can do, child. She's got the milk sick and she's slipping away. What she needs is fresh air, not smoke in her lungs. The poison's getting close to her heart. Bayberry smoke will make the ending easier for her. Get out of here. Get out! All of you, get out! Give me that. Lord, no! Where are you going? No! Don't you get near her. Don't you even touch her! Whoa! Ho, ho. Ho! Latch up the door so she can't come back in. You just let her come, I'll show her what for. Effie. Who's that tormented child to distress you so? She's a fine child, Granny. And a practiced doctor. I should have known. Teach her, Granny. She's a good learner. She has a loving soul. Excuse me. Too late for medicine, child. Your nor mine. Herm, take Beck out. Yes'm. Beck, it's time you go. Birth and death don't belong in the same house. Go on. Some reunion, huh? Meg, mountain folks has been curing their own hundreds and hundreds of years. [SIGHS] Now, we've got plenty of professionals. Now, we've got plenty of time to-- [PANTING] Understand them, Meg. Learn from Granny Arrowroot. [EFFIE PANTING] [GASPS] Effie, don't give up. Tend her, Meg. Don't let go. Please, don't. Don't die. Granny. I give my house... [PANTING] [GASPS] Effie, I'm not gonna let you give up. Somebody hold this for me, please. Well, damn you all to hell. Kissing on the dying. Cursing yourself to die within a week. [GASPS] She's damning herself to hell, that's what she's doing. [GASPS] No. Effie. [CRIES] No, no, no, please. No. Save your tears for the living, child. She's passed over into a life better than this one. Because of you. And don't touch her. No need to fear death. She's peaceful now. Just close your eyes, you'll never fear death again. [SOBS] Do not put your hands on me. You're welcome to stay for the burying. And after that, I think it's time for you to leave. [TAMBOURINE PLAYS] [♪♪♪] You can allow the Sin Eater to enter the home of Effie Webb. [♪♪♪] Deal over with the fire. Deal over with the heat. With this food. Effie Webb's sins, I eat. GROUP [CHANTING]: Free this woman, Lord, of any sin. Get from her and give to him. Devour, devour, in death's hour. Devour, devour, in death's hour. Devour, devour, in death's hour. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Effie Webb's soul is with our Savior in heaven. [♪♪♪] No need to vacate tonight, child. I'm not. You stay the night, and tomorrow I'll find somebody to guide you down the mountain. Effie asked me to stay, and I'm staying. It's people like you that should go so other people don't have to die needlessly. I think you're making a mistake, child. I am not your child. And the folkses at Eagle Nest ain't your children. They are mine. Then love them enough to guide them to my door when they're sick. You know, a long time ago, on the mountain, not more than echo from here, there was a herd of sheep grazing on a high plateau just as free as the wind. They had more than nature's wonders to eat and there were stars in the sky. And one day, a mountain lion seen them sheep. She didn't mean them no harm, even though it was her nature. But she saw them as poor little critters with nothing to protect them. So she decided that she'd be their protector, knowing they'd love her in return. So here she comes running down to them with all the good intentions in the world. But she's still a lion. Well, them sheep was scared. And they were so scared that they run right off the edge of the plateau. Now the lion, seeing they really needed her protection from whatever was chasing them, she started to run, and she run even faster. And, you know, she run right off the edge of that cliff herself. And she died. In trying to protect them, she's the one that killed them. Well, that's quite a story. Perhaps I can help you to rewrite it with a happier ending. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] A doctor, eh? I used to be a dentist myself. Had me a chisel and a hammer, knocked them tooth from here to the lake. Oh, whacked them out the cup. I have heard of easier ways to pull teeth. Well... if we did needed your easier, city-fied ways, we'd have never fought the war. Dixie ain't New York, you know. Never was, never will be. Sound about them government people reckon this is one of your United States. Well, up here... we don't need nobody pushing your damn notions upon us. Not no one. Not never. [♪♪♪] Good morning. You? You get yourself away from this door. I just wanted to speak with you for a minute, if I may. If your minute is so precious to you, you'll kneel to the ground and pray the Lord forgives you. And pray hard. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Dear, Thom. Please forgive the quivering of my pen, but my hand is tired. All of me is tired and I miss you so very, very much. [MUSIC PLAYING] Don't stop playing, it sounds wonderful. Howdy. I've got a sign I'd like to put up here in the store. Um... Give you $5 now and a dollar for every person that comes to me. I can't say one way or to the other. I'm just watching things till Mr. Slocumb gets better. Mr. Slocumb's sick? I mean, till he comes back. We heard what you done at the dying. You're an evil woman. I don't wanna talk to you. Are you afraid of me? No more than I am the devil himself. Well, you better be afraid of me. And you also better answer me, unless you really wanna see what evil's all about. Now, what is wrong with Mr. Slocumb? Mr. Slocumb. MR. SLOCUMB: Can't see no one. Go away. Mr. Slocumb, my name is Meg Laurel. I'm a-- Uh, I have some medicine that can help you. We've got all we need. Go away. Mr. Slocumb, please. Respect our door. Mrs. Slocumb, I apologize-- Out. Get out, I told you we don't need-- Doug, lay back. Granny tells you just to lay still under the covers. Mrs. Slocumb, how long have they been sick? None of your business. Please, leave us be. Please, listen to me, Mrs. Slocumb. I realize that that my ways are different and your ways are very old and part of your tradition. Medicines have been discovered scientifically by people all over the world. Some of these people have spent their entire lives to find a cure for the kind of disease your husband and children are suffering from. Now I have those cures right here. I don't want anything in return. I want you to let me help people you love get well. So has Granny Arrowroot worked her whole life to find cures. She give us this-- This slippery elm bark. She made the ooze herself. I trust she knows as much as any has them that you're talking about. Does they make their ooze any different? What I have is not an ooze. GIRL: Mommy, mommy. My belly's got the burning again. Best you go now. Mommy here. Don't you dare touch that child. I don't want your child to die. Get out of my house! Go on, get out of my-- Get out of my house. Don't do this to yourselves. Doug, no! Doug, please lie-- Can't you see you're doing nothing but hurting? Please, for the name of decency, leave us be. I'm sorry. Yes, I'll go now. Mrs. Slocumb, one more thing please. I've got some alcohol here. I'm gonna leave it for you. Rub it on and it'll help. And I'm gonna leave this medicine here also. Just give them three spoonfuls a day... Don't you leave nothing. Mrs. Slocumb... if you love your family, you will do everything possible to keep them from dying. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Herm. Add Bugleweed and Timothy-grass to your list. Oh, I got a trump clear up to Eagle's Peak for Bugleweed. Bring back some of its growing earth and then you can trump into the growing room. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I knew she'd be here, eventually. Well, let her in. I just came from the Slocumb's. Do you know that Doug Slocumb is dying? On your way, Herm. He won't die. Oh, no? I suppose you think all of your oozes and your teas and whatever else you concoct is gonna save him. Not all of them. Just what I give him. I can save that man's life with proven medicines. I'm a doctor. Why are you fighting me? Why are you fighting me? Because of this and because five little girls died from loss of blood because of your treatment. Go ahead. Take a look. But I'd put my cut right there so as you can bend the arm and keep it from bleeding. Now that's far as that. Her name was Granny Bacon. Perhaps she didn't have your expertise. Well, if one of your city doctors surgerized poorly and a being dies, would I have the right to say all city doctors are useless and evil? Is that what you've been saying about me? No. Because everyone I've talked to is afraid of me because of you. If I come uninvited to the place you learned your doctoring and I could like my ways were the only ways that could cure folks and your ways were ignorant, how'd they treat me? Did you respect Effie Webb? I did. Well, she helped put me through medical school. She also asked me to stay here and do what I do best. Now if you respected her than you respect her wish-- Medical school? How much of your life that take? Four years. Four years. Child... these mountains is the biggest medical school there is. And I've been learning in 'em for 40 years and I still can't learn it all. But I know that God Almighty wouldn't put us here if he didn't have a remedy for every ailment. Now out there are plants that can cure every illness if we can find 'em. And I know the ones that will cure Doug Slocumb. God also gave us brains. Is it a sin to use them? Child, you're climbing a tree with no top. I ain't fighting your close-mindedness-- My close-mindedness? You wanna help these folkses, you leave. If I leave, the people that'll suffer the most are the ones you are keeping me from helping. If you wanna see how they suffer stick your finger in a pail of water and pull out and see what kind of hole it leaves. [♪♪♪] LAURIE MAE: Tarnation, learn to fly. What'd you do to make the wind hate you so? The wind likes all kites. All you have to do is know how to introduce them. Would you like me to show you? Hmm? Okay, now, here, you hold the kite. Come here, hold it in that hand. All right. Now... hold the string right here in this hand, just like that. Not so tight. Hold it just like you're gonna hold a little bird, all right? See, your kite and the wind, they're not sure of each other, it's like you and me, huh? You see, they have to be introduced slowly. So, uh, when you start to run just let out a little bit of string until you can feel the wind starting to take the kite. Then you let out some more string and the wind will take the kite right up in the air. Then you just keep running and you let out the string. Pretty soon you won't even be able to pull your kite and that, uh, wind apart. They'll just be so taken with each other. All right? All right. Well, go on. MEG: There you go. [♪♪♪] Hmm. Down! Ah! Down! [BEES BUZZING] [LAURIE MAE SCREAMS] Hyah! [CRYING] Laurie. [CRIES] Hold on, honey, hold on. Hold on. Hyah! Hyah! Hold on. Okay-- [CRIES] Hold still, honey. All right. All right. It's okay. It's okay, honey. I know, sweetie. Come on now, come on, lay down. Turn around. Honey, I know, I'm sorry. But we have to take your clothes off. Here. Come here. Come here, sweetie, come on. Sit up, sit up, Laurie Mae, come on. It's okay, sweetheart. Bee sting, bee sting, what's the toxin--? Damn it, what is it? Bee sting to body weight... so poison will be lethal with, uh... Oh, God, she can't be more than 60 pounds. It's okay, sweetie. Take some of these, Laurie. Laurie-- Laurie, come on, I want you to take it. Laurie, now come on, take some of this in your mouth. Trust me, okay? Please. It'll make the pain stop. Take a little bit, just-- Oh, good girl, okay. Take a little bit for me. Little bit, little bit. That's a girl. It's not too bad, is it? Okay, a little bit more, please. That's a girl, Laurie, thank you. We'll take these tears out now, baby. As soon as we get them out, it'll make you feel better. You promise to wait here, huh? Okay. Come here, sweetie. Come on. Think about your kite, Laurie. Think about your kite. It's way, way up there in the wind. Up above the trees and the mountains and... and you're up there with it, you're up there flying. Go ahead and pretend, close your eyes, sweetie. Good girl. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] All the way here she kept screaming for Granny. And I'm sure had I taken her there, the allergic reaction would have kill her already. As it is, I don't know if she's gonna make it. It may take days for the medication to neutralize the poison in her system. Thom, a father has a right to know the whereabouts of his child, but if I tell him I have Laurie, I know he'll take her away. So where does my responsibility start and where does it stop? Mm. You're hungry, huh? Mm-hmm. [♪♪♪] Oh, Laurie, honey. Didn't I tell you not to scratch? Yes, ma'am. Wish my Pa was wedding you instead of Sophie Pride. Though I like Sophie. She's my friend. I think she'll make a good ma too. She ever gets fit to wed. Is something wrong with her? No, not yet anyways. You say "just like me" every time I stop and I say a story. Okay. I go'd into a cabin-- You say "just like me." Oh, just like me. I looked out a window. Just like me. And I see the smelly skunk. Just like me. Just like you. I don't get it. You smell a skunk just like you. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Silly girl. You trying to steal my daughter from me? Pa, I got stung by-- I don't wanna hear no word from neither of you and you. You , I should have shot you the first time I laid eyes on you. And child, get yourself over here by me. Move when I tell you. Please, calm-- Now what she do to you? Come on, say. She give me some of her medicine. She had to, Pa. Now what kind of devil stuff you put into my little girl's body? Don't harm her. You'll burn in hell fire if I hear one word more. Don't threaten that child. Stay out of there. No, please, don't-- Stop, stop-- Don't do it. Granny best be able to undo what you did to my little girl. [CRIES] Oh. She kept me from dying. Pa, it's wrong what you did. How'd you come near to dying? Bees, Pa, all over me. You see? [♪♪♪] Tarnation. Still... ain't nobody got the rights to do nothing to you, unless she comes to me first. Nobody. Not even Granny. Ho. Hmm! Giddy-up. Giddy-up. [♪♪♪] Wait. Please don't be frightened, I'd just like to talk. My name is Meg. I'd like to talk to you. I'm sorry if I frightened you, I really didn't mean to. This work is magnificent, did you carve it all? There is no reason to be frightened. Remember me? I saw you at Effie Webb's. You shouldn't odder looked at me. Why not? Because I'm filled with sins and they come out ugly on my face. Now go, please. I beg you, go. I'm not afraid of you. Don't be afraid of me. Please don't. Don't touch me! My flesh will burn you with hell fire. Forgive her, Father, for she felt the devil within. Forgive her, Father, for she felt the devil within. Please, don't do this. Turn away! For your own salvation. All right, all right, but just let me stay and talk to you then, please? Please? [SIGHS] Who made you believe that you could-- that you could take people's sins just by eating food? My pa. He had folks' sins put in his whole life. My tummy is poor and hungry. When he died, the Lord was on his one shoulder and the devil onto other. Both just waiting to see which one got his soul. But the other one know Sin Eater. No worse than eating the sins my Pa had in him. So my ma... she cried and she prayed. She put the food on his body... and she waited... and waited. But there is nobody came. So I ate from off him. I was the one who opened the way up for my pa to be with the Lord in heaven. Now... I'll be what I am through my lifetime. Please, let me turn around. I'd like to look at you. No, no, don't cage your eyes on me. For your salvation. You see, whenever I comes around, folkses is sorrowing. That's why I never make no carvings of it. I don't wanna see no sorrow. In wood nor flesh. So don't you be a-sorrowing none for me. I just can't understand how the people here could do this to you. To another human being. If I ain't want what I am, my life might have no meaning at all. Do you expect every year you live to be better than the last? I always hope it will be. Well, up here, every year is harder than the last. Being closer to the Lord like we is, he puts his will on us mighty hard. Floods, storms, frost crops. He takes a lot of us folkses up the hill. Up here... on the mountain. The past, that's the only solid place to grip on to. You can't fight the lords, will you? Now you can't be a part of the folkses up here unless you come to know that. You leave from here. Now if you'll ever see me again, you let the folkses see you turn from me, you'll be closer to 'em. Would you come to me if you were sick? Would you come to me if you was dying? Yes. Well... If you was to want me to take your sins from you then it wouldn't be the way of things for us to have any meetings together. But you-- You best take your leave now. But when you-- When you get to where you're going, you look in the Bible book at Romans 15:7. Lord be on both your shoulders. Ma'am... it's a pleasure to me nicely to have you to talk with. [♪♪♪] "Wherefore receive you one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God." Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God. [♪♪♪] Dearest Thom, for the last month and a half, I haven't ventured beyond the shadow of this house. I have occupied my time with the burdens of mountain life trying with all that's in me to understand what makes these people so different. I honestly don't know how much more I can take. Survival here is so hard. I can see why the people attribute everything to God's will, because they take the burden upon themselves with the impossible. And that, my dearest, is the root of my problem. I have, however, come to understand that I must accept their ways if they are to accept mine. But then, you know me, I have never been able to find the secret of compromise. Thom, if I stay, I will need medical supplies desperately. I will include a list of what I need, so please try and find a way to send them to me. I hope and pray all is well with you, because I still love you very, very much, more than I ever realized. And I'll be with you tonight in my dreams. That is if I can ever get to sleep. All my love forever, Meg. [♪♪♪] [COUGHS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Uh, just a minute. Laurie Mae, hi. You're just the person I needed to see. Oh, here's your shirt. Well, thank you, but you shouldn't be here. It's all right. My pa's getting warmed up for his wedding. Oh. It's tomorrow. He won't know I'm gone. Besides, he was awful sorry for what he done and I have to come see you. Are you all right? Let me check you over. Oh, ain't me, it's Sophie Pride. The one my pa's marrying to. Uh-huh. She's pained and I tell'd her you could help. Well, what's wrong with her? Where is she? Outside. I'll go bring her in. Okay. This is Sophie. She's ready to be wed now, because she got the curse yesterday, but it's paining her. It's not really a curse, sweetheart. It's just the farthest thing from it. You're just changing from a girl to a woman, that's all. And it happens to every girl. I knows. It doesn't really hurt now, does it? It's just... I don't know, scary. All right, you come in here with me and I'll show you exactly what to do and I'll tell you all about it, then you won't have anything to be afraid of, all right? All right. Once a month, a part of our body that's able to have babies, gets an egg all ready, just in case we decided with our husbands that this is the time that we wanna have one. Now, if we're not married or if we don't decide at the exact time of the month when the egg is ready, then the egg and the blood that was waiting to give the baby life has nothing to do, so it just comes out. It's not really our own blood that we're losing anymore either. It's just kind of extra. See? Uh-huh. Okay. Sophie, aren't you a little young to be getting married? My sister was younger than me when she wed. I was getting scared. I'd be a old maid before I got to do my woman's duties. So you wanna get married, then? Sure. Harley needs to have a wife and Laurie Mae and Joshua needs a ma and I love him. [CHUCKLES] [WHISPERS] Sophie wants you to come to her wedding. Would you? Oh, Sophie, I'd love to, thank you, but I don't wanna ruin your wedding, honey. But you wouldn't. People will like you if they know you. They surely would. Well, of course they would, I mean, what's not to like. [BOTH CHUCKLE] I just, you know, I make the people around here a little nervous. Couldn't you try real hard not to? I tell you what, if I decide to come, I will show up with bells on, how's that? Would you like some vegetables too? I ain't hungry and I don't think you would be either. Oh, really? Well, thanks for the advice. [CROWD CHEERING] Best day, Mrs. Pride. Best day, Grandma Pride. Laurie Mae, don't you look pretty in that dress. How you gonna like having a Ma again? Just fine. Can I speak with Sophie? You know you can't. Unless you want your new Ma to join your old one before the wedding's even commence. Why child, you ought to know better. Sorry, ma'am. You don't believe you're gonna die talking with me, do you? If you do, I'll crawl right back out. Then don't you talk, I will. Soph, I don't think she's coming. [♪♪♪] [COUGHS] [♪♪♪] [CROWD LAUGHING] Your moonshining days is over, Harley Moon. Now you take this broom and sweep up this house. And then cook me dinner. MAN: Whatever you say, Sophie, whatever you say. [CARRIAGE APPROACHING] You can put your eyes back into your head, I ain't no ghost. Shows you how much we needed your scientific medicine, huh? How much Granny couldn't cure us, huh? How we was all gonna die unless we listen to you. Well, Granny's got more cure and power in her little finger than you got in both your hands. Giddy-up. Hallelujah, hallelujah! Oh, what a wonderful day the Lord has given us to bring two young people in love together. Before we begin with the wedding, what you want, look, it is here. Granny. Oh, oh, you look like sunshine. It warms my heart to see you hailing hardy. Well, we're muchly obliged to you, Granny. We see death medicine lady on the road and give'd her thunder and lightning skewed down to a fine poison. And if she don't go on along, then I myself will push her all the way down this mountain. And she showed steel in her spine though and you got to give her that. Was she coming here? No, she went riding up the hill. That's snakeroot. Cuts through pain in the belly like knife cutting through bread. You know, ever since I was a little girl, I wanted nothing else but to cure people. So I learned the way and it's a good way. But I guess maybe it's not the only way. Child, come take a walk with me. First I'd like to apologize to you. No need. I have no right-- No need for words when you're speaking from the heart. Come on, child. What you see when you look around here? Oh, I know you see the world's largest pharmacy. Pharmacy is where we keep our medicine. Oh. That purple bark over there, you mix that with dandelion root and the sick liver turns to healthy. I don't know, I-- As much as I want to believe all this, I have a very difficult time doing it. A doctor come here once before, when I was closer in years to my birthing than my dying. And he upped and stuffed boxes full of worm wood. Now, I always use it to bring on sleep. But he said he made something out of it that they called it, um... Absinthe. Mm-hm, it's a sedative. [COUGHS] That make you sleep? I'll never know why he went to all that pain to take one thing out the other. Child, does your chest feel tight right here when you cough? I'm fine, really. I just-- I get a cough when I'm not sleeping well. Oh, wild yam. I'm fine, really, honestly. How many grandchildren do you have? Nary one. I just never chose to take a husband. Although I-- I did have offers. No, I-- I got my family. I've been Granny Arrowroot since my 29th year, when my ma passed on. And I took to healing folks just like she did, and her ma 'fore her. You know, the folkses up here got to be of one mind so they'll all tie in together. And it's a granny's lot in life to be that mind. It's a shame though, I won't be passing it on to a girl child. Well, um... we best turn back or we'll miss the wedding. Granny, um, I don't know that it's a good idea for me to go to the wedding. You look like you're wearing a wedding-going dress. [♪♪♪] You go ahead. I'll just stay back here, all right? It's a good place to watch from. [♪♪♪] Who is the husband to be? ALL [IN UNISON]: Harley Moon. And who is the wife to be? ALL [IN UNISON]: Sophie Pride. MAN: And who are the children? ALL [IN UNISON]: Laurie Mae and Joshua. And will God watch over them all? ALL [IN UNISON]: Yes, he will. Sophie Pride, do you accept in the eyes of God this man Harley Moon to be your husband, and his children to be your own? Yes, I do. Harley Moon, do you accept in the eyes of God this woman to be your wife? I do. Laurie Mae Moon, do you accept in the eyes of God this woman to be your mother? Yes, sir. Joshua Moon, do you accept in the eyes of God this woman to be your mother? [CROWD GIGGLES] [CROWD CHEERING] All right now, everybody stand out of my way. ALL [IN UNISON]: One! Two! Three! Four! [CROWD CHEERING] Come on, children. [BAND PLAYING] Laurie Mae, come here. Laurie Mae. Laurie Mae, you go to your Ma now. You listen to what she say. [♪♪♪] Yeah, thank you. Good luck, Harley. WOMAN: Bye. Congratulations. Here's the gift. Bye. Bye-bye. Congratulations. MAN: Bye-bye! Thank you. Goodbye. Good luck. [♪♪♪] Roy, stop twitching and lay still. But it's my back that's the problem, Granny. So why are you sticking them needles everywhere else, but in my back? Oh, stop running off the mouth, tell me when the pain goes away. Oh, hold it. It just stopped. I swear, it just stopped. I can't feel any aching no more at all. [WOMAN COUGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] Now, you drink this nice and slow, and it'll help break up that cough. There's absolutely no scientific way for what you did to work. Just drink it before it cools down. I suppose now I'll never cough again for the rest of my life. Child, I can see your eyes right on the edge of opening. Now, don't hold them closed with your mouth. I'm sorry. Now the day's passing, and I got to load that old mule down and hope she can carry me to all the folkses that can't come here. May I go with you? Suit yourself. [♪♪♪] You check them all, Herm? Yes, and they's all alive. Herm, would you take this into the house for me, please? I'll pick it up on my way back. [♪♪♪] Come tell me what you think this is. Oh, I'd say that's a sebaceous cyst. Child, you and them words. Well, that's what it is. Essey-- Sebaceous, sebaceous cyst. No matter what they call it, it's irritated. How'd you get it out? Granny? Oh, hush. This lady has been to school for four whole years. Now, she knows what she's doing and if she don't, I do. How'd you get it out? Um, surgery is really the only way. No, not always. Oh, no. What are you gonna do now? Now you just watch. Granny. Watch with your eyes, not your mouth. Here, hold that. Now, it's gonna take them maggots near a week to eat all that infection right out of there, clean as a hound's tooth. You don't actually mean that-- Tell her what happened last time, Walt. I had it so bad, I couldn't hear my own voice coming out. Well, when Granny pulled the maggots out, I could hear a chick pecking out of its egg a mile away. You mean they actually eat the infection then? Nothing but. [♪♪♪] [COUGHING] I'm all right, it's okay, let's go. Little Becca live her all by herself. Dipping for an old hound dog ever since her folks passed over. Nobody knows who the pappy is, and Becca ain't telling. But she will be birthing a baby girl inside a week. You can tell in advance it's gonna be a girl? You telling me with all them school ways you can't? [KNOCKS ON DOOR] [DOG INSIDE BARKING] Becca, calm Shabby, you hear me? [DOG INSIDE BARKING] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [GROANS] Granny, she's in labor. [WOMAN GROANING] Becca. BECCA: Granny, oh, please. Shabby. Okay, that's a good dog. Yeah, good now, dog. Yeah, you go. [BECCA GROANING] Granny. That baby is coming right now. Take deep breaths. Breathe in real deep, okay? You have to let out some of the tension. Come on, take a real deep breath. She's fighting it. I know, I'm trying to get her relax. Get some worm wood in my bag. We aren't gonna need that. Just get her to breathe right. Well, you best hurry because she's starting to bleed. Becca, Becca, listen to me, okay? I want you to breathe every time I count. I'm gonna count, okay? Take a breath, one-- Come on, take a breath. Two. Okay, come on. That's it, good girl, okay. Breathe, take another one, come on. Ahh, it's paining. Feeling something bad. You can do it, come on, ride through the pain. You can ride through it. Good girl, okay, start it again. Let's start the breathing, come on, one-- Take a breath, come on. Two, good girl, okay. Take another one. Three. She's out of our hands now. What are you talking about? I mean, that baby's coming the wrong way down. It's breach? I mean, the both of them are in God's hands now. Where are you going? Get something to make it easier for her. Save my baby, please. Save my baby. It's okay. Your baby is gonna be fine and so are you, Becca. Just don't be frightened, okay? Don't be frightened. Granny, would you forget about that please, and come help me take care of her. Child. Yours isn't the only way either. It is a breach. I'm gonna have to do a Caesarean section. What's that? It's a surgical technique-- Oh, damn, I don't have my bag here. You mean to tell me that you can save her and the baby? Your way? Yes. But I don't have the things that I need. Well, just tell me what you need, and we'll make do with what we got. There isn't enough time. I need a scalpel, surgical needle, some thread. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] This is gonna hurt a lot. So you might have to hold her down. There won't be no pain. There will be pain, just be ready. [♪♪♪] What you waiting for, child? I've never done this before. You're holding the knife, but the good Lord's holding your hand. [♪♪♪] Granny, keep her cleaned off. Okay. I never thought I'd see the womb of life with my very own eyes. Granny, wipe my face, please. Thank you. There it is, there it is, Granny. She take the long way into this life, but she's here. [♪♪♪] I'm gonna lift her out now. Better tie off. [COUGHS] Take her from me, Granny. My hands are shaking. No, they ain't. They're as still as your heart is strong. But we best make her cry, put the soul of life into her. [♪♪♪] [BABY CRYING] [COUGHS] [BABY CRYING] [COUGHS] Child. Child. I'm okay. Would you tie a cloth around my nose and mouth, please? [♪♪♪] [COUGHING] Now, you best let me finish doing this. And I've been watching you. Ain't all that different than sewing a quilt. [♪♪♪] [MEG COUGHING] [♪♪♪] [MEG CLEARS THROAT] [♪♪♪] Oh, Becca, I gotta check-- She's fine, she's fine. She's resting, child. The baby? Oh, she's beautiful. There's an old saying, when a new life comes into this world with beauty in form and face, it's the mirror of the one who carried her from her birthing place. That was a wonderful thing you did, child. I misjudged you greatly and your ways. A lot of your ways I want you to learn me. I want you to teach me too, Granny. Effie Webb told it to be true. That woman had more wisdom in her dying breath than you and I put together. That's hot. Oh, no. No, no need to talk, no more, no need. [COUGHS] Okay, I think I better check on Becca. No, I want you to sit still. I heard rubbing in your chest and I want you to take it easy. Can that child be moved? Yes, I think so. As long as we're real careful. Well, I think the best thing is that I take us all back to my place. There's a wagon out back and we can just hope that the mule and the horse will pull together. Oh, we've already done that, Granny. [MEG COUGHING] How's this? Spit in my hand. Come on. Come on, spit in my hand. Go on, spit in my hand, spit. Okay, okay. [COUGHS] It's a color of rusty metal. What do you mean? I need a plumber? Don't be taking that too lightly. That means your lungs are filling up with your body's waters. And the darker the spittle, the worser it is. [MEG COUGHS] Please, stop, enough. [GRUNTS] I'll make you a poultice for your chest. All I need is some sulfur. It's a miracle cure, Granny. All you do is you inject it directly into the bloodstream, and that's it. It's incredible. You don't want the poultice? Oh, no-- I mean, yes, yes. Anything you make me I'm sure is gonna be fine. I'm fine. [♪♪♪] [COUGHS] I can't find what you asked for, child. Best you look for yourself. [♪♪♪] I don't know where it is. I can't find it. [MEG CRYING AND COUGHING] Now best-- It's best you sit up. I wanna put this poultice around you, it'll help a lot. Can you sit up? [MEG COUGHING] Do you wanna hold my baby? BECCA: Will that make her feel better? Well, I'm sure it would, Becca, but not right now. You go on back to your room. Well, does she know I was thanking her in the wagon? Yes, yeah, yeah, she knows. I'm gonna name my baby after her. BECCA: Will that cheer her up some? Yes, yes, child. That's real nice. Now you go on back to your room. Can you lay down again? [MEG COUGHING] [♪♪♪] MEG: It's gone. No, no, no, please. Don't-- Don't-- Don't break them. Innocent. Pl-- Oh. I need the sulfur, I need my sulfur. Granny. Granny. She's a-jabbering again. Well, mix me a brew of club moss and hickory. [MEG MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] I can see it. I can see it. It's at the bottom of-- But that's okay. It's okay, it's okay, I can get it, I can get it, I can get it. I'll get it myself. Oh, I'll get it myself, I can get-- Child, you get yourself back in that bed. Granny, I have to go. I have to get my sulfur. It's in my other trunk. It's down the mountain. Granny, please. Child, child, child, don't-- Don't do this. Come down. Don't. You got-- I got the medicine down at the bottom of the hill-- You got to get back into the bed. You got to stay warm. Now, come on, Granny help you. Now come on. Good, that's a good girl. Come on, come on. [MEG COUGHING] GRANNY: Now, just lean on me, child. So we can get you back into bed. How far down to Little Oak did it fall over the side? I'm gonna get your medicine for you, child. Now, I don't want you to climb out of this bed. You hear me clear? Harley. Harley Moon. Something I want you to do for me. LAURIE MAE: You broke her medicine. You should ought to get her the other. She gifted us at our wedding. She gifted herself to us. I'm scared she's gonna die, Harley. unless you-- Hold it. [BURPS] [CHILDREN GIGGLING] Pa? Please find it. [♪♪♪] You stay quiet. Keep your distance, you hear? [MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] Leave her be, Laurie Mae. But she's trying to speak to us. It's the sickness. It's making the words come out of her mouth. But she's sound asleep, so best we don't. Granny. I hear you brung a young'un kicking into the world for Little Becca. So I choose to bring you the bestest clothes in my store for you. Well, that's kind of you, Doug. Who told you about the baby? Bob Tarr said he passed you on the road. Besides, you can't keep news from anybody up here. Well, let me give you some news I hope you put up in the wind. It weren't me that delivered that baby. It was that city doctor woman. Now the baby and Becca would have died if it weren't for her. Now she's a good woman and she has good ways. And right now, she's laying in there on the edge of dying herself. Now if you wanna spread some news, you go tell all the folkses to pray and pray hard. If that child dies, we're all to fault. Now ya'll chew on one of these. Laurie Mae, you go open the windows. Sophie, you open the door, we need clear air in this place. Granny, could my baby have one to chew on? She get her protection from your milk. Now you chew on that real good, you hear? Now, now, now, drink this, child, please. Well, now let it go down inside you. Don't let her die, Granny. Don't let her. Granny will cure her up. Please, Lord, have her get cured. She should not have to go yet. Why don't you all pray with Sophie? The Gods are with you, child. You got to know that. Now just lay still please and sleep. And let Him move His healing miracles within you. Bless you, child. Put yourself in His hands. Laurie Mae, how is your spelling? I know letters. Can you figure out which one of these says sulfur? Sulfur. Sulfur. I think this is it, Granny. Will it stop the sickness? I don't know. There's only one way you're ever gonna know. That's to go ahead and have her drink 'em. She told me that it had to get right into the blood. Harley, go fetch me a reed. Yes. A real thin one. [MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] No, don't-- Don't leave me. I won't. Don't leave me. I won't, child. I was just fixing-- No, no, no. Don't cut me. Don't cut me. Don't cut me, please. I have to get your medicine into your blood. Please, please, huh? I got to get your medicine in your blood. No, no, no. You're gonna kill me. Don't kill me, please. Don't cut me. Please, please. Harley, best you can hold her down? Yes, ma'am. Uh, no, no, no. All right, girl, you settle down now. No, what is-- Settle down. Hold down her arm and keep it steady. Effie, Effie, please. Effie, don't let her do it again. Please. Hold still, girl. Don't let her do it again. Forgive me, child. I don't know no other way to do it. She ain't dead, is she? Best we readied ourselves for what could happen. Harley, could you go and fetch the Sin Eater to come? My baby's got her name so she won't die really. [ROOSTER CROWING] Granny. Whatever this is on my chest, get it off, it stinks. Is she all right? Child, oh, child. Come on. It's clear. It's clear. Can we go to her now? Be easy with her. Hi. Hi. We've been waiting for you. Harley fetched your medicine and Granny, she put it in. There's folkses waiting to see you. They've been praying for you. They know they've been wronging you and they're purely sorry. I'll let 'em in and let 'em tell it to you theirselves. Uh-huh. You come on in now. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Put some elbow grease into it. You can't put strength out when you're trying to get it back in. Oh, Granny, I have to do something. Let me hammer a nail. Anything, please? I'm just going mad. Better mad than sick again. Tell you what, I'll make you a deal. If you let me hammer a nail, I will... Will what? I'm thinking. Oh, your tea is boiling all over in there. Look at-- Hi. Hi, what you doing? Come, look and see. We paint all the old stuff. It's pretty hard. Laurie Mae, Sophie, you hold that fool child right there. Now I'm your granny doctor, and best you do as I say. Granny, that's my hair. You-- Meg, Meg! Oh, Meg, you have no idea how good you feel. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. What are you doing here? The medical supplies you ordered. I'm the only delivery boy who desperately needed a job. Mr. and Mrs. Slocumb, I would like you to meet my husband, Thom Laurel. Pleased to meet you. How do you do? Hi, it's a real pleasure. My pleasure too. Hi. This is Laurie Mae and her mother, Sophie. Hi. Her what? My Ma. And she's an awful spoiled child. Thom Laurel, this is Granny Arrowroot. She owns the largest pharmacy in these mountains. Well, meeting you would be a pleasure, I'm sure. But I didn't wanna drop that woman of yours on her bed and sit on her so she'd stay put and get well. I like her already. Yeah, well, She sounds like a thunderstorm, is really just a summer drizzle. Come on, I wanna show you the inside. That is if it's all right with my doctor. I think I can trust you with him. She's also a very bad judge of character. You're a popular lady. They've loved me from the start. Couldn't you tell by my letters? It's not Boston Memorial, but then that's Boston Memorial's problem. And now you've brought the supplies and I'm so glad you're here. Your timing couldn't be more perfect. You know me. You know, of all the people I've met here you're... you're the one that made me understand. I wish there was some way I could thank you. You already have. How? You didn't die. I carved something for you. It's supposed to look like you. I thought you didn't carve people. I doesn't. Though I'll never get to heaven, I know that the angels... they got to look like you. From an admirer? Uh-huh. Stay here with me, Thom. Meg-- There's so much to do. They need doctors here. They need to be brought at least part way into the 20th century. Not all the way because there's too many wonderful things that they shouldn't lose. Honey, med school was just the beginning compared to what there is to learn here. These mountains are full of wonderful-- Meg, stop selling. I can't stay here. Why can't you? It's a question of paths. Ours have separated. Well, they could just be going in a circle. That's not impossible, is it? Anything's possible. I still love you. Don't stop. Don't you stop loving me because of what's happened. I couldn't even conceive of not loving you. I always will. Come on, come on. They're nailing it up. What? Come on, you'll see. Well, let's go.
