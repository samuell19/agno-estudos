TAKEDA SHINGEN PART 2 Who are you?! Sanada Yukitaka. You dog! Die! I have been awaiting your return. The head of Murakami Yoshikiyo. Good work! Kansuke, you have done the finest Job in this campaign. It was all the doing of Sanada Yukitaka. Call Yukitaka here. He is no longer here. What? He says his faction desires no master. That Sanada... Can't you do anything, Kansuke? There are warriors who have no wish for fame and fortune. Hearing that makes me want him all the more! Men...! I need more men in order to become victorious. My lord! A messenger has arrived from Kozuke. Uesugi Kenshin is gathering the forces of Kozuke and Musashi and is hurriedly returning to his camp in Echigo. He has probably caught wind of events in Shinano. KASUGAYAMA CASTLE UESUGI KENSHIN'S RESIDENCE Lady Sentoin has been awaiting you. Sister, I am home at last. You must both be exhausted from battle. Yes. After riding with Lord Kenshin through his battles I find my legs are wobbly because of my advanced age. Lord Kenshin, please take your seat up here. LADY SENTOIN Sir Yamashiro, make yourself comfortable. Thank you, my lady. Let me take that. Such a lovely maiden. Lady Sentoin, who is she? She is Kano, the daughter of Sir Hatakeyama Yoshimasa. Sir Hatakeyama? I had heard he had a lovely daughter. My lord, is she not a fine maiden? Yamashiro... I take it your tongue has not tired much. Sir Yamashiro, it seems he has seen through your scheme. Scheme? I have no scheme! My lord, I...! I must speak with my sister. Go and rest yourself. I am vexed that you accuse me of scheming. Scheming...! You understand, do you not? Everyone is worried as you have yet to wed. Kagekatsu can be my successor. My late husband would have been pleased to hear that. However, your subjects wish to see your own son succeed you. I lost my parents when I was little, and was brought up by you. My mind is set on having a woman like you for my wife. So long as I do not find anyone superior to you, I shall not marry. Must you trouble me so? The truth is, you do not wish any encumbrances, is it not? Take it as you will. Rumor has it that you will soon head for Shinano. I hear that Takeda Harunobu is quite a strategist... but you should have little trouble in defeating him. When that is done, will you head for the capital? You must realize, you cannot remain single if you are to rule the nation. If I live so long... You must not speak so. Is your encounter with Lord Takeda so worrisome? I have never known a fiercer adversary. I look forward to our encounter. Why is it that the eyes of men light up when it comes to fighting? It is something we women shall never understand. Come over here. I must tell you... we shall face our most powerful enemy in this war. Is he Uesugi Kenshin of Echigo? In terms of fighting ability, there is no way we can win. We probably should abandon defense and go on the offensive. In that case, you take Taro and seek shelter with the Imagawa. No, we won't go. What? If the enemy comes here, I'll take Taro with me and go to Mt. Uga to fight our enemy! Do you think that it's alright to end the Takeda's bloodline? You have more children in Suwa, haven't you? Shiro and Taro are not the same! Taro is my successor! Hearing that, I am sure that we aren't going anywhere now. I think it's the heir's job to defend the castle while the lord is fighting the war. It seems I can't afford to lose this war now. Both Taro and I think... the strongest man in the entire world is Sir Takeda Harunobu. We really believe that. But victory can take a long time. I'm not worried no matter how long it takes. I wonder if we can visit Kyoto someday when our hair is gray. Oh, my... What are you talking about? The promise we made when we got married, I never... forget them. KAWANAKAJIMA Kawanakajima, a flatland formed where the Chikuma and Sai rivers meet, was a most strategically important point in conquering the Shinano district. By chance, this became the point where Uesugi and Takeda would face each other. Uesugi Kenshin led a force of 8,000. Takeda Harunobu's troops numbered 10,000. The most famous battles of the warring states, the Battles of Kawanakajima, were to be repeated five times over a period of twelve years. The first war ended in a small battle and from summer through autumn this was an endless battle in the swamp. The enemy! We are not! Kuwa! It is you! She is my wife! What are you doing here? Kuwa! Where is my husband? Where is he? Yohei... is dead. Dead...? - Yes. He is buried in the next gully. Hana! Hana! Gosaku, please come with me. What do you mean? I will be executed if I am found. We must harvest the rice before it rots. Mother is deathly ill... and the children... I cannot do everything myself! Is there no one to help? There are only women and children in the village. Besides... Another will be born in spring. In those days, most of the soldiers were farmers. They were needed on the farms during sowing and harvesting seasons. This was one of the major reasons why the battles dragged on so long. Men, we shall now withdraw. We are getting nowhere in this battle. We shall review our tactics. Hokkoku Highroad will soon be cut off by the snow. Kenshin will likely withdraw to Echigo soon. Danjo! Remain here and build a fortress. On Kawanakajima? Yes... Build it to the east of the Chikuma river overlooking Kawanakajima. It must be completed by spring. Yes, my lord. Kansuke... There should be a few under Kenshin dissatisfied with their lot. See what you can find. I will do my best. We have a longer way to travel than the Uesugi forces, which makes resupplying our troops difficult. We must build a direct road between Kai and Shinano. Victory must wait three years. Yataro... What do you think of Takeda Harunobu? I feel that he is very tenacious. He can withdraw as well as attack. ''Katsuyori''. He is named for both me and your brother Yorishige. It is a name appropriate to the master of this castle. This castle? I want him to be worthy of becoming lord of Shinano. I am sure my late brother would have been pleased. Let me hold him. He is heavy. Fine, fine... He nurses very well. He has a dignified look like his father. His name will surely be known throughout the world. I see... Throughout the world...? Listen, Katsuyori... If I do not succeed, I want you to grasp the reigns of this nation. Surpass me... Become an even greater commander than I. My lady... The lord is using his battles with Uesugi as an excuse for not returning to this palace. That woman of Suwa must be detaining him. I hear he has named her child Katsuyori. My Lady! If the position of... Taro Yoshinobu becomes endangered... it would be disastrous. He swore before the family treasures that Taro would be his heir. It has been five years since then. There is no telling when a man might change his mind. And that woman of Suwa is a frightful temptress. I saw my father a while ago. He is still hale and hearty. ''Let me lead the troops against Echigo!'' he said. To Nobutora, you are still a child. Battles today are not fought as they once were. Capturing a castle is not enough! The goal today is supremacy over the nation. The battles between you and Kenshin are being followed by warriors throughout the land. Sir Harunobu, you must not be defeated! I wish to accompany you... when you enter Heian castle in Kyoto. Heian castle? You say I will enter the castle? We Imagawa are descended from the Ashikaga line. You Takeda are descended from the Genji clan. Who, except us... could shatter the dreams of the Kamakura Shogunate? I shall rule the country... and you shall add the finishing touches. Thus, the country unified by our families shall be as firm as a rock! Sir Harunobu... This is my daughter, Riri. Welcome... Sir Harunobu... How old is your son, Yoshinobu? He has turned fifteen. A fine age. Blood is thicker than water, they say. No one is more trustworthy than blood kin. Sir Harunobu... Do you not agree? I am one who turned against his own father and sent his sister to her death. All the more reason... I know just how you feel. Sir Imagawa... I thought that... the Imagawa and the Takeda, could form a pact and fight as one! It is for that reason... I called you here today. Will you believe in me and fight with me?! I am very honored by your words. I have done it! I have done it! Now, we have no one in the world to fear. This is an auspicious day! Excuse me. The lord has returned to the castle and is on his way here. The lord? He wishes to speak with Lady Sanjo. What could it be? My lady, please prepare yourself. I shall go out to greet him. Welcome, my lord. Okura, is Sanjo here? One moment, my lord. If you have bad news... please let me know what it is. Her Ladyship has been under the weather of late. Let me through! My lord! Sanjo, it has been a while... I understand you are not feeling well. It is nothing to worry about. I had been worried that the years of battle... must surely have worn you out. I am relieved to see you so well. It is true, I am tired, but it is nothing to worry about. I went round from Suruga to Sagami. Suruga and Sagami? I saw Lords Imagawa and Hojo. Lord Hojo Ujiyasu of Sagami? I have promised to give Tama in marriage to Lord Ujiyasu's heir, Ujimasa. Tama? But Tama is only ten. Lord Ujiyasu's daughter is only eight, but she has been promised to Lord Imagawa's heir, Ujizane. And Lord Imagawa's daughter shall marry Yoshinobu. A wife for Yoshinobu? With this, the Takeda, Imagawa and Hojo clans will be bonded by strong blood relations. I would like to ask a question. Did you arrange this marriage for the young lord because you recognize him as your future heir? Of course! Yoshinobu is my heir. There is no one else to succeed me. Is that really true? Enough! How wonderful! How long we have waited to hear those words. My lady... It was worth the long wait, was it not? What is wrong with Okura? Am I so unworthy of trust? Women tend to worry needlessly... especially when it comes to their children. I am sorry... My lord... What is wrong? My lord! I am very tired. I shall rest a while. My lord! My lord! Oh dear... He has a fever. Get a doctor, hurry! My lord! Please hang on! My lord! I am Suzu. I am very pleased to receive Your Ladyship at the castle of Suwa. I am comforted by your words. We had not once exchanged greetings since you became the lord's concubine. It lay heavy on my mind. Thank you. It is I who should have come to you. I hesitated to, due to the circumstances at the time. I hope you will forgive me. Lady Suzu... I have come here to you for a reason. I want you to promise to keep this to yourself. What is it? It is about the lord's health. Our lord? At the end of last year, when he returned to me, he suddenly developed a high fever and was confined to his bed for a while. We thought it was exhaustion at first, but the fever would not subside. According to the doctor... he is suffering a mild case of consumption. Consumption? Keep your voice down! The doctor says... that exhaustion is worst for consumption. It may be cruel to ask this of someone so young... but do not do anything that would tire him... even if he so desires. You understand what I mean, do you not? I understand you very well. However, the Lord Harunobu told me he felt most at rest when he was here at this castle. Lady Suzu... My lady... I am no longer a mere captive. Aha... so that is it. You still despise the Takeda clan and are coercing him to overtax himself. Please watch your words. You are in the castle of my son, young lord Katsuyori. He is merely a vassal of the heir, Yoshinobu! If you care at all about your child's future, take heed of my words... and do not embrace any evil designs. Excuse me. The young lord has arrived to greet Her Ladyship. I am Takeda Katsuyori. I am pleased to make your acquaintance. Such a fine young man. I am not surprised that the lord loves him so dearly. I understand a marriage has been arranged between young lord Taro Yoshinobu and the Imagawa clan. You must be quite happy. When young lord Yoshinobu becomes the Takeda chief, we shall need the assistance of your son. Lord Katsuyori... Be sure to apply yourself to your studies and to martial arts. How wonderful, Lady Suzu! For the sake of this child, I ask for even greater loyalty toward Lord Harunobu and the Takeda clan. Riri, daughter of Lord Imagawa, was a year older than her husband, Yoshinobu. My father presented me with this sword upon our marriage. Please take it with you in my stead. You would give me something so precious? The upcoming battle with Uesugi... will be one of life or death. If you should die... I shall not go on living. TAKEDA YOSHINOBU I have myself a fine wife. I shall surely distinguish myself. KAIZU FORTRESS Our scouts report no movement in Echigo, yet. Kenshin is biding his time. Yoshinobu... If you were Uesugi, what would you do? My main body would be on alert on Mount Chausu. The rest would be divided between Igajima and Shinonoi. I would lure the Takeda forces out of this fort and attack them from both sides on the Hachiman plain. But, I may not make this my headquarters. Then, why did you build this fort? Ask Danjo... He is good at the game of Go. Danjo... In Go, the placement of the stones determines victory. The placement of stones in your opponent's territory must be determined by reading his strengths as well as the flow of the match. My lord... I don't like the look of that mountain. It feels as though we are being looked down upon. Do not worry. Kenshin would not come in so close. My lord! Horsemen from the Hachiman plain! My lord! That is Taigen Sessai! Could something have happened in Suruga? Lord Takeda, since you are in the midst of battle, I shall skip the formal greetings. My master, Lord Imagawa left Sunpu for the capital yesterday with his army. What? Lord Imagawa is heading for Kyoto? I have brought you a message from him. This time, you must destroy that tiger of Echigo and head for Kyoto as early as possible. We shall have the streets of the capital covered with carpets woven of Kai silk to welcome you. Lord Imagawa said that? Lord Takeda... My master looks upon you as his successor. I also believe he needs your assistance in order to be able to take the reins of rule. It is for that reason that I have come to you. Sir Sessai... Please apologize to Lord Imagawa for my delay in defeating Kenshin. I shall bring Kenshin's head to him in Kyoto. Such promising words. There will likely be foes along the way. Please remain alert. I pray for your good fortune in battle. Excuse me. Word of Lord Imagawa's plans should reach Echigo soon. It should stir them into action. Danjo... Stay here and defend the fort. Nobushige, take Yoshinobu back and round up the men. Sowing season should be about over. Father! Will you not join Lord Imagawa? He plans to take the reins of rule. Echigo is second to this! I did not ask your opinion! But...! - Young lord...! It has been a dry rainy season. A great storm may be brewing. I hope the journey before Lord Imagawa is a tranquil one. In 1560, amidst the rainy season, Imagawa Yoshimoto marched his massive army to Kyoto. He rode full of confidence as he had no equal along the way. The Imagawa forces have captured the forts at Kakegawa and Futamata, and are now entering the province of Mikawa. They should be entering the province of Owari, soon. What do you think? They should have little trouble until Kyoto. Things will not be so easy thereafter. Lord Imagawa likely has dreams of great splendor, but he has a myriad of foes within the city. The Imagawa administration should not last a year. Sure enough. You will have to lure Kenshin... to Shinano as soon as you can. I have Kansuke working on it. Lord Uesugi's vassals, Okuma Asahide and Kitajo Takahiro are in sympathy with us. So, you are lighting a flame from within. Kenshin has cursed me as a villain who deals in trickery. His anger will be to my advantage. And what do you want of me? I want you to slip into Kyoto and defend Lord Imagawa. I should keep him alive until your time arrives...? A ferocious man, are you not? It was Lord Imagawa himself who got me to start dreaming of ruling the nation. And you want my assistance? Yes. Before I give you my answer, there are some people I would like you to meet. But, you are Azechi! Azechi, wife of Yamamoto Kansuke. What? Kansuke! My lord, these are my children, with Azechi. Now, greet the lord. I am Yamamoto Torao. Yamamoto Kosuke. I am Nene. Here, let me have a good look at you. You are Torao? How old are you? Twelve years old. I see... Twelve...? Yes. Azechi... Teach him to be a fine young man. One as fine as his father was. Yes... So the son of Suwa Yorishige and Nene still lives. Sorry I kept it from you, my lord. Kansuke, a storm is brewing. Let's hurry! MAY 19TH, 1560 ODA NOBUNAGA Attack! Oda Nobunaga, lord of Owari took Imagawa Yoshimoto by surprise at Dengaku gorge. My lord! Wait! My lord! My lord! You are saying Imagawa Yoshimoto was slain? Yes, sir. Oda Nobunaga caught him by surprise in Dengaku gorge in Owari. But, Oda leads a tiny, insignificant province! I just can't believe it! Yataro... Keep an eye on Takeda's movements. Father! Sir Yoshinobu! They say Oda Nobunaga is advancing toward Suruga. I would beg permission to rush to their defense! No! Father...! - No! But, Oda Nobunaga is the man who killed Lord Imagawa! A samurai can't stand by and do nothing! Kansuke! Young lord... While your father is ill, you head the Takeda clan. You must act with restraint. Lord Imagawa was as precious as a father to me as Takeda Harunobu is. Can I sit here doing nothing when Suruga castle is about to fall to Oda Nobunaga? Young lord, I can well understand how you feel. If Lord Harunobu censures you, I shall end my life in apology. So shall we! Thank you! I thank you, too. With this, my late father's soul should rest in peace. Please take this parting drink. Sir Tenkyu! As I thought! Kansuke's words made me begin to worry. It's a foolish thing you do! Hyobu! Why didn't you stop this?! Sir Tenkyu, don't stop us. I must go to Suruga at once! You must not! If you leave the province without permission, even if you are the heir, you will be punished as a traitor! You are wasting your breath! Throw these men into our cells! I must place you into confinement... until I get word from the lord. Demon! Is there no one in the Takeda clan with a compassionate heart? I won't let anybody take Sir Yoshinobu. I will stop anyone who tries it. Riri! Let it go... I am sure my father will understand. A few days later, Riri was sent back in haste to the Imagawa clan. You have not eaten...? That's not good for your health. Young lord... how long do you plan to refuse to eat? I want to see my father. I shall not eat a bite until then. Not even we know where your father has gone. The assassination of Lord Imagawa by Oda Nobunaga... was a bolt from the blue for the lord, himself. Drastic changes must be made in his plans for the future. Your mother has taken to her bed in anguish. Take your meals and build up your strength... and wait for your father's anger to subside. I shall watch for a convenient moment to intercede. That won't be necessary! I have done no wrong! I have no wish to succeed him if I must lose my compassion to succeed! What are you doing?! - Let go! Father hates me! He detests me! Let go! Sir Yoshinobu! My lady! Sir Yoshinobu, we have found your father at last. I shall go to see him. Do not give up. I shall help you. You must not give up! It's an unexpected guise. Surely you don't intend to become a monk...? No, I am praying for yet another year of life. You will go into battle once more? What will you do about Yoshinobu? Yoshinobu... I must disinherit him. Disinherit? I have sentenced Obu Hyobu and the two others to death. I can't show mercy toward my son alone. Disinheritance is a greater humiliation than death. When he hears of this, he will surely choose death. Couldn't you take him into battle with you? He is our firstborn. Let him die a samurai, at the least. Enough! Yoshinobu is no longer a samurai of Takeda clan. How cruel! I have not only Uesugi Kenshin... but Oda Nobunaga, a new foe to defeat as well, now. The smallest unrest within the clan could be fatal. You would sacrifice even your son for victory? The lives of my vassals are just as important! Then who shall be your successor? There are many talented men. He need not be a son. Do not try to hide it. What's that? Don't you plan to make Katsuyori... son to that woman in Suwa, your successor?! Well, that could happen. How terrible karma is! You are about to make exactly the same mistake your father Nobutora did. What glory is there for a nation, whose leader, seduced by a woman, strays from the path of righteousness? Calm down! Don't you see? That woman seeks the destruction of the Takeda clan to avenge her brother's death. Silence! How can I be silent?! How can a mother let her child be killed? Why don't you kill me first?! I shall go to heaven and tell my parents... my husband truly was an ogre! My lady... Pull yourself together. My lady... I understand perfectly. I am the wife of a samurai... I will speak no more. However... I want you to keep your promise to me... That you shall become the ruler of the nation... and take me to Kyoto. I shall look forward to that day. All bow in the presence of the lord! You may lift your heads. We shall rise in arms to subjugate Uesugi Kenshin! According to our scouts... Kenshin has gathered... 20,000 of his best men... at Mount Kasuga. This battle will be... a desperate fight, for both sides! Prepare yourselves! You shall all swear in writing... your unwavering loyalty to the Takeda clan, before our family treasures. just a moment! I'm disturbed that you ask for a written pledge. My lord, can you doubt our loyalty to you? There's no reason for a pledge! Our loyalty is absolute! Not to me... But, to the gods! Hereafter... consider my commands to come from the gods! If you do, the path to supremacy over Japan will open before us! Harunobu himself presented written supplications at Ikushima and Tabishima shrines pleading for the ruin of Uesugi Kenshin. Here, for the fiirst time, he signed his Buddhist name, Takeda Shingen. This was the spring of his 40th year. Sister... I am off to battle. I have come to say goodbye. Should I die, let Kagekatsu succeed me. I have informed my chief vassals of my intentions. Shingen has sent nearly his whole army to Echigo. Neither of you is in his right mind. Now, with Lord Imagawa gone, the road to Kyoto is wide open. The seat of supreme ruler is within reach. If you are not careful, it will be stolen from under your nose by this Oda Nobunaga. Ever since the Kamakura Shogunate, the position has been an honor bestowed on the strongest of warriors. I cannot ignore Shingen when he is here before me. May the gods watch over you. Goodbye. Reporting! About 25,000 Uesugi clan troops just arrived in Zenkoji and now they are coming this way! Excuse me! Kenshin Nyudo will probably make camp on Mount Chausu. Go tell Danjo that no matter how hard they try to seize the castle, don't leave the castle. Yes, sir. Let's go. AUGUST 14TH, 1561 KAWANAKAjIMA The Uesugi forces have crossed the river and they are heading for Mount Saijo. Let us make a sortie. If they set their camp on Mount Saijo, they will have us under their thumb! No! We have orders not to leave this spot. But...! Kenshin, too is looking... for a way out of a fatal confrontation. Kenshin set up camp on Mount Saijo, overlooking the Kaizu fortress. How bold of him to place his headquarters on Mount Saijo. But still, tactically, it's a foolish move. They will probably watch our tactics and change their plans accordingly. In any case, it's a very unusual placement. Kansuke, what do you say? Let me have a look... We should put our camp on Mount Chausu. The enemy's camp on Mount Saijo will be caught between us, and Kaizu fortress... and they won't be able to move easily. MOUNT CHAUSU AUGUST 24TH AUGUST 29TH Both Shingen and Kenshin had set up camp, but, neither had made a move by the fifth day. The time has finally come. Your mother has sent you some sake. For her sake as well... let's make this an honorable end. Shingen quickly led his main troop into the Kaizu fortress. And so, Kenshin on Mount Saijo came eye to eye with the 20,000-man Takeda force. There has been no movement! Kansuke, what do you think? Is it time to strike them? Yes. There's more smoke than usual rising from the fort. So... Shingen is about to make his move! SEPTEMBER 10TH The 15,000 men led by Kosaka Kanjo would attack from the southern face of Mount Saijo. The 8,000 led by Shingen diverted attention from the Kosaka battalion by crossing the Chikuma river ceremoniously and making camp on the Hachiman plain. Make a raid on Mount Saijo, draw the Uesugi forces out, then surround and annihilate them on Hachiman plain. That was the famous ''Woodpecker'' strategy of Yamamoto Kansuke. But Kenshin, it seems, had seen through his strategy. Leaving their flags and torches behind, they quietly descended from the mountain. In summer and fall, fog lies thick over Kawanakajima. Shingen was completely surprised by Kenshin's tactic. ''Whips hushed, they cross the river by night.'' Strategically, Kenshin had the upper hand. Is there no signal from Mount Saijo? Not yet. It's taking too long. Sir Danjo, what are you...? Forward! I hear something...! Horses! They are approaching! It's the enemy! My lord! The young lord...! I am the son of Takeda Shingen, Takeda Yoshinobu! Be prepared! Young lord! Young lord! We have been tricked! The enemy's on the Hachiman plain! Hurry! Let's go! Damn... My lord, Kenshin has outwitted us. Our position is dangerous. You must pull back! My lord! My lord... It is your heir, Sir Yoshinobu. I brought him here by my own decision. It was an honorable death! Save your tears! Our battle has only begun! Kansuke... You were too confident! You are a fool! Sir Shuri, take care of Lord Takeda. Yes, sir! Take away Yoshinobu's body! Shingen's headquarters is beyond those pines. My destiny hangs on the outcome of this battle. Death is as insignificant as dust... My fame shall climb the heavens. Get ready! Charge! Prepare the muskets. Get ready! Fire! Sir Nobushige... Charge! Sir Nobushige! My lord! Kansuke... Kansuke! Azechi! My lord...? No need to worry. Sir Sanada has come. Good... Azechi... take care of the children. Kansuke...! Kansuke! My lord, it would be reckless to pursue them any further! If I pull back now, I will never be able to defeat Shingen! My lord! Takeda's assault force and Sanada's troop are coming this way. We must retreat, or we will be caught between them! My lord! That Shingen! He has the devil's own luck! It's Kenshin! After him! By afternoon, the Takeda armies had the upper hand. The fourth battle at Kawanakajima became a confused, exhausting melee with deaths on both sides totaling 8,000. My lord... The Uesugi forces have all retreated to Echigo. Kenshin will probably never return to Shinano. Our armies have won. Tenkyu Nobushige... Yamamoto Kansuke... Mochizuki Jinpachi... Naito Shuri... Morozumi Masahiro... I have lost... I have lost all of these irreplaceable men... ..in these battles! This is not victory! This is not victory! Shingen continued to fight, and defeated the Imagawa clan, who held power in the Kanto area... Shingen took his army down the Tokaido Highroad towards Kyoto... Shingen was 52 years old. MIKATAGAHARA, TOTOMI PROVINCE Reporting! Our defenses have collapsed before the assault of the Takeda armies! The enemy is rapidly approaching these headquarters! TOKUGAWA IEYASU Damn it! You men are such cowards! My lord, we must go back to the castle! Hold it! Oda is sending reinforcements. Reporting! Lord Oda's 3,000 men were routed by Takeda's forces! My lord! What about the Sakuma and Takigawa men? Turned tail, every one. Damn it! Takeda Shingen is only a man. I, Ieyasu, shall kill him by my own hand! My lord! Please calm down! Let go of me! If I should fall without a struggle, we will be disgraced for generations to come! Please calm down, my lord! Shingen is after Lord Oda. Let's resign ourselves to retreating, here. Shingen won't likely chase us far. I see... He won't come as far as Hamamatsu? Shingen never spends more effort than he must. That would be a relief... After his easy win over the Oda-Tokugawa forces Shingen made for Owari without a moment's rest. The lightning speed of his campaign seemed to reveal his impatience. Why is Shingen in such a hurry to get to Kyoto? It's said that he's been seriously ill, but he commands his army like a vigorous man. My lord, what will you do? The vanguard of his force has already reached Mikawa-Akasaka. If you will allow me to, I can negotiate with them for peace. Not even with the devil's help can we hope to defeat Shingen, strong as he is now. Silence, Monkey! Takeda Shingen... truly is the greatest of commanders. And yet, these Chinese military tactics he uses are out of date. This is the perfect chance for me to test the techniques I learned from Europe. He shall never take Kyoto! I won't let him grasp the reins of power! Sir Katsuyori has arrived from Ina. Bring him here. I am Katsuyori. Father, may I congratulate you on your impending march into Kyoto. You must be tired after your journey. The battle against Oda Nobunaga shall be your first. My performance, I pledge, will please you. We attack at dawn tomorrow. Please rest awhile. Sir Katsuyori... just had an audience with your double. He was convinced? Yes. Oda Nobunaga is a formidable enemy. If he lives... Katsuyori will surely die. Somehow, I must... kill him... before it's too late. I shall not be defeated... no matter what kind of strategy he may use! I shall reveal... for all to see... the essence of my strategies. My lord! Danjo! I want the men posted this way! Advance guard... Yamagata Masakage! 2nd line of defense... Akiyama... Akiyama Hoki! 3rd line...! 3rd line...! What? Shingen has pulled his troops back? Yes. We received word that he suddenly turned back soon after crossing into Owari. What is the reason? Trouble at home? Or with Takeda himself? No matter the reason, we are saved... Monkey! This could be a trick. Stay on the alert. You are a devil... A devil! A devil! It's a pity... It's a pity...! Father hates me! He despises me! Harunobu, what is taking you so long? You were destined to rule the nation yet you waste your time with senseless battles. You truly are a fool! This kind of poem is popular in Kyoto, now. ''From the capital... ''To Kai is such a long way, a millennium... ''To hasten Takeda is to hasten the sun...'' The capital! Can't you see the capital, yet? Where are the Oda forces? You wretch... Oda Nobunaga! Prepare for death! My lord! My lord! Sanjo... You have come to me...? Yes. Sir Danjo sent word. I came at once. Sanjo... It seems my luck has run out. Such timorous words! You promised me you would rule japan one day... and you would take me to Kyoto, didn't you? Please keep your promise... for the sake of all the men who died for you. My lord... There is no need for you to suffer any longer. Leave the rest to Katsuyori. Please come to my side. Suzu... Tell me the truth... Did you always despise me? I despise you... for making me suffer such sorrow and pain. I despise you bitterly. Suzu! No, please, don't die! The Takeda clan is nothing without you! Who else could possibly rule the nation?! Sanjo... I shall not die! I shall never forget my promise to you! My lord! See the enemy in their winged formation. So, we shall use a scale formation! Our layered line of defenders should overpower them! As swift as the wind... as silent as the forest, as engulfing as flames and... as steady as the mountain! Listen, everyone! Believe there is no foe before us, and push on! Man is his castle... He is the stone wall... He is the moat... Compassion his ally, vanity his foe. This poem was composed by Takeda Shingen, the greatest commander in all the warring states. Directed by: NAKAJIMA Sadao A PRODUCTION BY TOEI COMPANY & TBS
