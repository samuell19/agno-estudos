[Let's combine some features\Nto create the ideal boyfriend.] [An exchange of text messages with him will\Nincrease point of love and fill the love meter.] [But, if the love meter drops down to zero, the game ends.]\N[Miyu Sato, aim high and do your best!] [Our company does not assume responsibility\N for any problems that may occur.\NFor inquiries contact "I~Scream"] Hello, Mayumi, \NI'm with Satomi. We're on our way. Then, what about what you told us earlier? Oh, I understand. - What did she say?\N- She suddenly hung up. She said her boyfriend wants to kill her. Eh, can't she be more specific? Well, we can't help it. She had a little disagreement with Riku\Nand left all of a sudden. His name is Riku? I really want to see\Nwhat he looks like. What do you think? What? Satomi-san, do you know about mobile boyfriend? I'm not surprised.\NYou're not interested in things like this. Lately, it's become very popular. It can be found and\Ndownloaded from the i-scream site. Is it like an online dating site? No. I'ts a game where\Nyou produce your own avatar. and then download it to your phone. I still don't understand, though. In fact, I'm also playing it now. He is called Masaya. What's with the love sign? When we communicate using e-mail,\Nwe can get points and the love points will rise. Love points? If it drops to zero, it's the end. If it rises to one hundred, there will\Nbe feelings like a taste of festival. Wait a minute, does that\Nmean Mayumi's boyfriend is a mobile boyfriend? He looked like the arrogant type. I really don't understand this. I have been keeping it a secret \Nfrom you because it is this type of game. You kept it a secret from me? This past year, aren't you still\Nin love with the shadow of a dead guy? Just leave me alone. Sorry. [This is the message box, please \Nleave your message after the tone.] No answer. We've already come all the way to her house. Well, it is because of her addiction to a game. We don't have to worry too much. But... ...she only answered the phone at home. Let's take a look. Forget it, let's go back. Tomorrow's a holiday, let's go. [Mobile Boyfriend] Excuse me. This is my sister's phone. Sorry, I'm just gonna look\Na little and quickly give it back to you. Nobody home? My parents are traveling abroad during spring break. Excuse me. Is that Riku? He's not moving anymore. The point is already zero. Is the e-mail still there? [Empty] It can't be. Did they delete all the\Ntext messages when the game ended? We can't even send a text to him. Even though she talked about it like that this boyfriend is just a game right? It cannot be killed. But, Mayumi says Riku is terrible and asked me to help her. At the time I thought it was a joke. What are you doing? I want to transfer Riku to my phone. - You can do this?\NMmm. [Unable to Send] It's not working - there's a connection barrier. It's an e-mail from Masaya. What is it? He said to me, "Why even bother to try?" Everytime I try to connect the phone to\Nthe other boyfriend he gets angry. What is this? This can only be done using your phone. What? I don't want to. Why? This is the only way. We can only investigate it\Nby using your phone. Give it to me. Let's do this. [New mail] [RIKU:] [I'M Riku. Nice to meet you. What is your name?] Quick. Answer. Will this increase the love point? I don't know about that yet, it is dependent on the system. Anyway, reply to this first. [Satomi]\N- sent. [RIKU:] [Ueno Satomi, 17 years old, right?] How did he know? I think it can read the personal\Ninformation in your phone. He can't do that without permission. Don't worry about that.\NQuick, ask what really happened with Mayumi. Let me do it. Switch to chat mode. What did you do to Mayumi? [SATOMI:] [What did you do to Mayumi?]\N[RIKU:] [Who is Mayumi?] Stop playing around. You were her ex-boyfriend, right? [RIKU:] [Who is Mayumi?]\N[SATOMI:] [Riku's ex-girlfriend, right?]\N[RIKU:] [Oh, is that right?!] You are the reason for Mayumi's suicide. [SATOMI:] [Mayumi committed suicide because of you.]\N[RIKU:] [Suicide is useless, no matter what happens.] I can't believe it! You're back. I'm home. Satomi, don't think too hard about it. Going to work? Sorry. Dinner is ready. I will text you when I'm coming home. Then, I'm going.\N- Take care. Somehow, I hate his look. Chat mode switch. You really don't know Mayumi? [SATOMI:] [You really don't know Mayumi?]\N[RIKU:] [Who is Mayumi?] Forget it. Why is everyone obsessed with this? It's not interesting at all. [SATOMI:] [That's enough.]\N[RIKU:] [Hey, am I your first boyfriend?] What is his problem? Why? [RIKU:] [Hey, am I your first boyfriend?]\N[SATOMI:] [Why?]\N[RIKU:] [So innocent.] Don't tell me you can see me? I liked someone from my school once. [RIKU:] [Because it seems so innocent.]\N[SATOMI:] [I was dating someone. He was in college.] Just tell him that. I don't understand this. That's not how you do it. Let me take a look. New student? What's your name? Ueno. Ueno what? I mean, your first name? Satomi.\N- Satomi. My name is Takahara. Third Year? Yeah, an exam candidate. It's done. Amazing. It's done. Ah, thank you very much. Excuse me. Takahara what? Naoto. Takahara Naoto. Goodbye. [RIKU:] [Industrial engineer, right?] How did he know? Right. We meet again. Hello. May I sit here? About the entrance examination: is it hard? Well, I can manage, like mathematics. See this? By the way, if there is a problem with \Nthe computer, you can ask me. Okay? Alright. Oh, Satomi. New hairstyle?\N- Yeah. My friends recommended it to me. It's cute. [RIKU:] [Why did you guys break up?] Godd morning. You're working hard. Good morning. Well, Ueno, you're late by two minutes. You have to do the cleaning work - no argument. Only two minutes. Any complaint, part-timer? No. If you're not happy with the job, quit. The manager loves to bully new workers. Did Eri go through it, too? Yes. [RIKU:] [Do not ignore me.\NWhy did you guys break up?] [SATOMI:] [I don't want to tell you.] Ah, mobile boyfriend. Is it popular amongst students? Wait. This point bar is too low. Why is it this low, Satomi?\NIt's only ten points. It's so like you. We were talking about my ex-boyfriend\Nand it suddenly dropped points. Of course it does. But he asked about it first. At this time, you should answer, "I only have you now." Or, "I just want you" - something like that. Then, how did he evaluate this through my text? I guess the good or bad mood can be detected by the combination of the words with a combination of several types of model systems. When the question is difficult to answer just write 'eh~' as an answer. [RIKU:] [Your ex-boyfriend died.\NThat's why you broke up.] Welcome! Your order please? Listen, I got ninety points. Crap, mine was only nineteen. Okay, Thomson. Excuse me. Did you listen to me? Yes. Why are you standing here? The guests are calling. Didn't you hear them? Yes, I'm sorry. Really troublesome. Sorry, your mobile boyfriend is right here. I took him from you. I transferred it\Nto my phone since your love bar is so low. How did you do it? You don't know? When there's nobody else we can pass the boyfriend through an intersection. I didn't know about this. Give him back to me. Eh, why? Unfortunately he can't be transferred back to the original phone. You're so bad. Sorry, but this is the fun part of the game. It's no problem, however, your love\Npoints are already near zero and I thought he was handsome. Now, I'm going to go home first. See you tomorrow. Do you have something to say, Riku? Die? Satomi I know about the relationship\Nbetween you and the senior Katahara. It's only an unrequited love. Maybe he didn't think of you that way. He may think that you're just trying\Nto study for the examination. Leave me alone. You're cute. I guess he just thinks of you as a cute junior. Senior, I want to ask you something. Can we meet? "Please leave a voicemail after the tone.." This is Samomi. I've been waiting for two hours. Please contact me. Satomi. Yuka, it didn't work. Senior didn't come at all. You didn't watch the news? - "There is group rape and burning at the apartment.." - "The identities of the persons who died have been confirmed.." - "There are thirteen people who died." - "Here is the list of the deceased." - "Rented apartment in Shinjuku on fire, killing thirteen people.\NWas it started by the rape victim?" Satomi? Have you heard about the apartment fire incident? Wasn't it started by the girl who was raped\Nand the victims burned to death? Yeah, yeah. One of the rapists was from our school. Really? That's scary. Isn't that Satomi who likes senior Takahara? Didn't she know one of the rapists? If she knew, she wouldn't have liked him, right? So she's being deceived?\NPoor girl. Can we have a little talk? We would like to hear the truth about this case from you. About that time? I am Igarashi and this is Asanuma. Hello. What about Eri? She died. This may be a shock for you but you were the only one who\Nwas there at that time. Would you tell us about that time? Did you talk with Aikawa before entering the toilet and finding her? At that time... This is very important. Please answer properly. You should do this when you're prepared. Please rest assured. We will wait for you. You can take your time. Mobile... The mobile boyfriend did it. It's the same for Mayumi. Mayumi said her mobile boyfriend would kill her. It must be the same with Eri. What is this mobile boyfriend? Eri was killed by Riku! Satomi! Your mother entrusted me to pick you up. Sorry you had to come all the way here. You've had a traumatic experience. They just don't believe me. They don't know what mobile boyfriend is. It's very difficult to explain. But when I think back, I should've just told them everything that I saw. I don't think the game has anything to do with it. That girl named Eri. She actually took Riku from your phone? If the love point is either zero or one hundred points, there's a legend that says you will die. Mayumi was also working on... Stop it Yuka. Masaya's love points are also falling. Let's delete it. If you delete the words it won't work. After we download it, there will be no end to this game. Look at that. It was an accident! Are you okay? It really is because of the mobile boyfriend.\NThe rumor is true. It's not only Riku causing it,\Nwe really will die if we play it. That's not true. It's just a rumor. The mobile boyfriend is the cause of this. Why didn't you believe me? Yuka, please calm down. It's no use. That's not true. Then you take him. I can't believe I called you my friend. [Yuka, I'm sorry about what happened today.] Well, we had a fight. Then, apologize to her. It doesn't matter who was wrong. Just apologize to her. It isn't so simple. Senior, why? Well, I thought you would go to the computer lab. That's what I was thinking. Well, it really suits your style, right? Don't joke around, I'm feeling down right now. In short don't send a text message after you have an argument. You must go talk to her. Have a face to face conversation is what I wanted to say. Good, really good... It's from my own experience. I understand. Thank you. Good. [MASAYA:] [You don't hate me, do you?] That's not it. [YUKA:] [I love you!] [MASAYA:] [You're lying. I hate liars.] Why don't you trust me. Why? [YUKA:] [Why do you not believe me?]\N[MASAYA:] [Then, if I ask you to kill yourself, will you do it?] Enough! This call has been moved to voicemail. Satomi, there's a call for you. Yuka. Satomi, it's me Saito. We're in the same class in high school, Saito Ikumi. Kumi? Satomi. Long time no see. How are you? You haven't changed at all. Kumi, you've changed-becoming more beautiful. I used to feel ugly, but now I'm finally feeling good. Recently, a lot of unpleasant things have happened. Finally, I get to have some fun. By the way, do you have a boyfriend? No. This is so sudden. Do you know about mobile boyfriend? Why do you ask? It's very popular now. There is a rumor that any girl\Nwho plays it will die. I don't believe it. But my sister is really dead. I wonder if we can do\Nsomething to prevent these deaths and put an end to it. We must continue to play as his girlfriend. Why are you telling me this? I didn't even play the game. There's no need to discuss\Nthis matter with me. That's not what I meant. I am the sixth person. Actually, Maki passed it on, but I couldn't contact her,\Nand I'm running out of time. Please, will you help me?! Will I be in danger? I beg you Satomi! My love point is twelve right now and I can't wait. This is my contact information.\NBelow is a true record of my contacts. You can call me everyday. If there is danger,\Nwe will immediately transfer it out. What's this? [MASAYA:] [If you ever leave me again, I will kill you.] Why? [I'm Naoto. What is your name?] He even has the same name. [Ueno Satomi] [NAOTO:] [Satomi. That is a very nice name.] What is your full name? [NAOTO:] [I don't have one. Only Naoto.] If I play mobile boyfriend, I'll die, won't I? [SATOMI:] [If I play mobile boyfriend, I'll die, won't I?]\N[NAOTO:] [Oh, I see.] Why? Your dead.\NHow did you become a mobile boyfriend? I wanted to see you. Senior, why? Satomi. I am very lonely. Was the time we spent together just a lie? No, it wasn't. Did you commit the rape? No. It wasn't me. Satomi, do you doubt me? I want to believe you. It's enough as long as you trust me. No! Yuka? Help me Satomi. What happened? I will be killed soon. Yuka! Yuka! Yuka! Yuka, are you there? What is this? What happened here? Yuka, it's Satomi. I'm opening the door. Yuka. What happened? Hang on. What happened? Will you take it? Please take it. What? The points keep dropping. Don't touch it. I don't want to see! I'm afraid! Please, calm down. Nothing has happened yet. It's alright. I can't take it anymore. I'm in the same situation as you. Let's find the way out together. How about it? What do you mean? This is Naoto. I got him from a classmate. See this... his face and senior Takahara's are very similar. He looks very concerned. OK, so, let's find out together. I can't do it. What did you say?\NIt's fine. I can't take it anymore. I think it's broken. Are you sure you don't want to take it? No! Thank you for the wait. - This is right?\N- Yes. - We appreciate your business.\NThank you. It's fine now. We even replaced the phone. Aren't you relieved? For you. Thanks. We can even do this, right? Yeah. We'll meet again. Why? Why is he inside this phone? I will do something. Wait for me here. [Do you want to transfer?] [No] What are you doing? I left something inside the locker. So, quickly take it. Okay. I apologize for taking leave so suddenly. It's alright. Okay. I can start again next week. I said don't come back. After what happened to Aikawa, we've all become very busy. It must be very relaxing at the hospital, right? Relaxing, you said?\N- Are you talking back to me? In short: your fired. You're working hard. Who did you pass it to? Manager. So, that thing is... Aren't you relieved that\Nyou're no longer in danger? Satomi, you must think about it. The girl who contacted me said that. It's all false. I can't believe you. But Satomi, he's not senior Naoto. Because...... You know what? He is one of the rapists. Sorry. Mother's phone. There's no way? [RYO:] [Why are you ignoring me?] Yuka, thank you so much for last time. What is it? Mom, this is...... Oh, you found out? I've been keeping it a secret from you. Satomi - the points. I'm too busy to do anything and have lost a lot of points. Reply to it quickly! There's no need. You can't. Oh, end already? Nothing happened. I can't believe it. It seems like it. What is it? I'm so glad. What are you two doing? It's nothing. So it is just a rumor. Now we don't have to worry about manager and the others. - We're such idiots.\NSo true. But why is mom playing it? Most of them are handsome, right? You're making me very nervous. This one looks just like senior. Even the name. Is it a coincidence? It is a common name. He's kind of cute for a game character. Good night. [SATOMI:] [Good night.]\N[NAOTO:] [Finally, you sent me an email.\NGood night Satomi. I love you.] In the TV shows and dramas the 'I love you' word is used often. But actually, very few people really say it. For me, if she is someone I love,\Nthen I really want to say it. Hey, if you really say it, then it would definitely be awkward. I won't be. Try to say it to me. I don't want to. Say it.\N- No. Yes?\N- Ueno? Manager Ishikawa died. It's true! So, you're telling us Ishikawa was also killed\Nby her mobile boyfriend? Even if the phone is broken,\N he comes back! It's true. There is a rumor on the site,\N that if the love points drop to zero you will die. But that is not the case, so rest assured. How are you so sure? Because, after you told us about it I went searching about\Nit on the i-scream site. There is nothing suspicious\Nabout it and no problems. I said that according to the rumors even things like\Nchain letters are not true. It seems like I cannot\Nrely on the police this time. You see... it's the same as telling children\Nthat ghosts exist. But they don't. When you were small, you must've believed it, right?! That's enough. We have examined Ishikawa's phone and there's no such mail. She doesn't use the system. Masaya must be in it. Is this it? I see. I will try to transfer it. I can't transfer it. Maybe men cannot do it? Is that the case? So, let me do it. Stop it. It's really very dangerous. [MASAYA:] [I'm Masaya. What is your name?] Is this the killer? Are you satisfied? No matter what other people say, it has nothing to do with the game. Even I didn't want to believe the rumor. He is a graduate from our school, named Naoto Takahara. He died a year ago in an\Napartment rape and arson case. I didn't believe it when people\Nsaid the phone boyfriend did it. What should I do? My point is already zero. It's alright. It's only rumors. If we don't use the phone, what will happen in the future? Let's just transfer it to a friend. I don't like this. I killed the manager. Hello.\N- Satomi? - How are you doing? Yuka. - You know, the human mind is very scary. - sometimes it can see things like ghosts. - At that time I was so afraid. You're right. - The phone must have just been sent\Nback to my home through the mail. Yuka, you know what... Never mind. - What is it? - Is it about your mobile boyfriend? It seems like the rumor is false after all. - So, it isn't true. - Satomi, thank you very much for everything. - You're really a true friend to me. - I just wanted you to know that. I'm glad you're cheering up now. - Goodbye. Now I don't know what to do. You aren't taking what she said seriously, are you? It's not that I really believed her. I really hate stories about\Nsupernatural and paranormal things. I really believed those things when I was little. Investigating her claims is our job. That event, the group rape and the arson incident in the apartment. The woman who was raped is the key point. It's written here that the fire was started by the girl. She set the crime scene on fire. About the persons who committed the crime: It's him, Naoto Takahara. He's the mobile boyfriend of that girl, right? Yes. That isn't all. Are you listening to me? I'm playing with the mobile boyfriend. This is also part of the investigation, and I'm almost at one hundred points. I can't wait to see what happens next. Nothing's going to happen. But she really believes in the rumor. The love points are full. We look like fools. That's the end. Hey, what are you doing? Don't do it! Stop! Welcome. Black tea please. What did you want to tell me? You don't believe me, right? Asanuma...is dead. Just as you said... she was killed by the mobile boyfriend. He was from the group\Nwho died a year ago. This is... Riku. Masaya. I saw it. It laughed on the mobile phone. Even now - I still cannot believe it. My mom's points are at zero, but nothing happened. Her mobile boyfriend is not one of them. That means... this group is the one who did it? What about the girl? This is the girl who was raped. She was one of the seniors' prisoner. That's not true. This event is not under our department's jurisdiction. However, when I investigated the timestamp... he was in the same apartment\Nas a part time computer engineer. However, it was the room below that was on fire. It seems like he was killed\Nwhen he tried to help them. Do you want to do it again? It can't be. I can't believe it. Why didn't you report it correctly? According to the reporter,\Nall the victims were dead but there was no direct\Ninformation from the police. Therefore, we cannot\Ndifferentiate who was in the group or not. The media only reports these things by ignoring his innocence. It's cruel. This is too much. Yuka\NSubject: I did it!\NI transferred him to my friend's mobile\NWell, because the rumors are hoaxes, it's fine\NThis is Masatoshi.\NYuka. Yuka is in danger. [YUKA:] [Masatoshi is interesting, isn't he?] [MASATOSHI:] [It's fun to talk with Yuka.] Yuka, answer it. Hello, Yuka? -Nope, this number is blocked. Who are you?\N- It's Masatoshi. Your name is Satomi, right? Quit playing around. - Yuka is my next taget. What is it? Her mobile boyfriend interrupted the call. Let me borrow your phone. She didn't answer it. I'll try to e-mail her. Please, read it. Yuka! Yuka! Nobody's home. Is there another way? We've tried everything already. Can you request a search warrant from the police? To get a search warrant requires evidence of a crime, and there are specific procedures necessary to get a search warrant. Then, should we just leave and do nothing? Yuka might die because of this. No, I don't anyone else to die. Please calm down. I will think of another way. Don't you have your own mobile boyfriend? It's okay... ...because... ...if this is really sempai... ...he would not do bad things to me. That's the case, right? Tell me, sempai, what should I do? Please help me. If the mobile game is the cause of this can't we stop it at the source? That company, the game's company... we can get it from the Asanuma survey data. Huh? What's with this e-mail? [Yuka, that mobile boyfriend is\Ndangerous. Please contact me. Satomi] Dangerous? What are you trying to say, Satomi? - If you try to call, Satomi, it's no use. Who are you? - Who do you think this is? To tell you the truth, - I've been around you a lot lately. Sempai? How? He reacted to my voice. Do you know me? It's Satomi. You're sempai, right? You're not like the other mobile boyfriends\Nwho committed the murders, right? You're different, right? Say something. What is this? The points are falling. Why? Sempai will not kill me. Why? This person...is not the same Takahara. [MASATO:] [You should try to live for a while.] The points are increasing. Satomi, what should I do? This is the company's building. The building looks familiar. To what? This is the building where the fire occurred. This building is closed, but I wonder\N if it has a working internet connection? Trespassing is against the law. - Where is it?\NSixth floor. Kumi? Go to hell. Kumi? Why? I lied about the mobile boyfriend. Don't do this. I'm trying to stop this. My mobile boyfriend told me to stop you. I won't stop until I kill you. Stop it! What should I do to turn this off? You can't destroy it. Wait, don't hang up! Sempai? I heard your voice, Satomi. But at first I didn't know who it was. Now, I finally remember. Is this really sempai? Yes. Thank you for calling me. I finally woke up. I'm sorry that I didn't believe you before. You have been misunderstood. About the case. - This is the i-scream company's office, right? The room which was on fire was on the floor below. - The room with the girl I tried to save? The ones who raped the girl became mobile boyfriends. At that time, those who burned to death\Nmoved along with the smoke and went into the server. So, this server is the cause? - It's not really because of the server. - It is because of the operational programs\Nthat were downloaded. But my friend is in danger. How do we fix this problem? - To remove the system, we need to use the program. - Mobile Boyfriend Removal Programs. - To delete the server. But, who can do it? Me?\N- There's no one else. - Anyone! Satomi! - OK, now open the database. - Click all of the folders. Many files have opened. - This is all of the data on the mobile boyfriend. - I'm sure those guys' information is also mixed in there. - It is dangerous for anyone to download. All this data... - Delete it. Yuka? Satomi! Help! The mobile boyfriend is trying to drown me. I'm trying to stop the server here. Please hang on. I don't know how long I will be able to hang on! Yuka? Sempai, what's next? - Then, use the upload command to remove the program only. I don't understand. How? - No, you made a mistake in the order of SCP. Wait, say it again! - SCP command\NSCP command! - Upload\NUpload! - Yeah, that's it! Yuka, are you okay? Yuka. Please, answer me. Yuka! Yuka! Satomi\N- Yuka, are you okay? Somehow, I was saved. I'm glad. It was successful. Thank you, sempai. - No, it's all your doing. - I couldn't have done it alone. To think that you can really listen to me. - Didn't I say... - enthusiasm can be spread everywhere. Satomi. Who are you talking to? Nakahata sempai. - It's hard to believe, though. I believe you. What is this? The points are increasing. It's started moving again. Now it's at ninety-seven points. - Yuka! - That program is not working. Sempai!\N- I must have missed something! What do I do? - Damn, I do not know. No way. Sempai. - There's one still there. - That girl. The high school students. - What are you doing?\NThe problem is that... She told me something. It's done. Send! - Yuka. - It's alright now! - Yuka! Is it really over? Yes, the system has been completely removed. Thank you. Satomi. - I will be there. Wait for me. The first time we met was at the computer lab. I want to see you. You've gone through so much. I'm sorry. That day... Did you know that I wanted to meet you? I could't keep that promise. I wanted to let you know that. Do you know why I went to the computer lab that day? Because I wanted to see you. From the first time I saw you, I liked you. Satomi. Cheer up. I don't have time. The program is gone now. No way. You have to disappear? I'm not supposed to be here. No\N- Don't come any closer. You shouldn't have come here. Naoto... I love you. That's a good, awkward line. I love you too. However, you are still alive. In time you will meet new people. I know. Goodbye. What happened here? Are you okay? What about you? It hurts. So, Naoto sempai is innocent. He saved us all. Now, he no longer exists. Satomi, are you alright? Yes, we have a promise to keep for him. That I have to move on. Is that so? Then, we have to try to find a new love! I agree. Kumi!
