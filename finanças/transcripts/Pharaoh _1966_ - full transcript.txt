PHARAOH Based on the novel by Boleslaw Prus Screenplay by Starring Director of photography Directed by Speak! Erpatre, the Most High Mouth. The holy scarabs are rolling a clay ball towards the sands. Go on. With due piety and homage to the Sun, I have stopped the march. You are a god-fearing Egyptian, though you have Hittite features. We shall not take that road, for we may crush the sacred beetles. Pentuer, does that gorge avoid the sands? - Yes. The gorge is one mile long. - An awful waste of time. Look at the army and you will see we cannot take that road. My soldiers do not fear the scarabs. You Libyans do not even fear kingly tombs. But it's unsafe there, since none has returned. Holy father, such an obstacle would not even hold back a donkey. A donkey will never be Pharaoh. Thus you will lead the army through the gorge, minister. I am not versed in the tactics of priests. Come, Thutmose. Your Reverence, the gorge is blocked by a canal. Then fill it in! Fill in the canal! Fill in the canal! I dug that canal myself. It took me 10 years. While others went to the market or danced. I was promised freedom if I brought water to this valley. Do you hear? Freedom! For me and my children! Do not fill in the canal! Light of the Sun, hear me! May wailing never come to your chamber, nor misfortune dog your steps. May the tide not carry you away when you cross the Nile. Merciful sire, 0 sire! Most noble sire! Engulf me, o Earth! It was a cursed day, when I saw the light and night! O, death! Grind my body to dust, so I may never be born a slave again on the fields of Osiris! It cannot be my father's will for his army to march around sacred beetles because the minister of war is a priest. - He is a great warrior. - What warrior? A holy minister of war. And what army is it when the best soldiers are hired Libyans? My great grandfather commanded 30,000 men, but my father has only half that today. And he can barely afford it. While the priests' coffers bulge so full with gold the Pharaoh's treasure cannot be seen. O, when I inherit the throne after my father, may he live eternally... I shall tread on their necks with a foot shod for war. What are you saying? The whole nation, led by the priesthood, will be against you. And who will stand with you? The army. Most of them will support the priests. - The Libyan Corps. - They serve for gold. Clerks? Half of them belong to priests. - O Jehovah! - What are you doing? - I wished to see the army. - Who are you? I am Sarah, daughter of the farmstead steward. A Jewess. You think Jewesses are not as sweet as Egyptian women? - I have had 3 Jewish mistresses. - You lie! A Jewess will never be anybody's lover. Not even the mistress of the Nomarch of Memphis' scribe? Even he. - Nor even the Nomarch's fan holder? - Even he. Not even the mistress of the Nomarch himself? Who are you? What do you want? No. You tell me if I please you. You have an honest face. If not I would have taken you for a Libyan mercenary or a bandit. He is not yet that. But he may become the greatest bandit the world has ever seen. And if I were as great as the lord you belong to? Perhaps you will be. They are calling us. And if I were the Nomarch of Memphis? Who knows, maybe you are. Ramses. Alert in the camp! And if I were heir to the throne? O Jehovah! Ramses! We must fly, Ramses! I will take you to my house. Stay with her, Thutmose. God of Abraham, Jacob and Isaac, have mercy on me... We are cut off, Erpatre. - Is the enemy there? - The invincible Nitager. Follow me! Attack those who have blocked our way! Kitarga! Kitarga! Kitarga! You are victorious, Ramses! You have proved yourself to be a great commander. You are Nitager, the most valiant of the valiant. Today you are the most valiant. He fought like a child of the pharaohs. He struck first! And if your commander had been equally headstrong? - How would it all have ended? - Leave the young warrior alone. He will become a commander, and will defeat the Assyrians, who must be vanquished, if we are to hold them back. Generals have to win battles, but ministers must know what to do if the generals should lose. Look Ramses: an Assyrian beast, taught to kill. May you live eternally, Erpatre. Live eternally. Soldiers! I swear to the Gods and to you that our war chariots shall trample Assyrian soil! Today the Gods let me taste the joy of leading men such as you! And since it is my will that you shall always share my happiness, I give 5 talents to be shared among the men! I give 5 talents to be shared among the junior officers. I give 10 talents to the minister and the senior officers. Tell me, Pentuer. Where will the heir to the throne find 20 talents? Find out for me. He awards the army, but His Majesty cannot pay Nitager's forces returning from the Assyrian border. And tell me, Pentuer. Is it right for the Prince to reveal his will to the army? As if he were the Pharaoh. Only a foolish youth would act this way. Or a traitor. Eunana! Take as many men as you need and re-dig the canal. Until the job is complete. May your will be done, sire. O thee, who rises above the horizon and crosses the Heavens. O thee, who throws his rays on our faces. O thee, who goes on and on. O Sun. O thee, who multiplies the hours, days and nights. O thee, who lights the Earth and himself. O thee, born of no one, who gives birth to himself on the horizon. O thee, eternal Son of the Heavens. O thee, Osiris-Ramses. O thee, Osiris-Ramses. Osiris-Ramses... Ramses. I am pleased, Ramses, that you returned hale from your arduous journey. May Your Majesty live eternally and fill both worlds with your works. My military counsellors have told me of your work and good sense. Your deeds will not go unrewarded. You shall receive 10 talents, a great chain and two Libyan regiments. What of the Delta Corps, father, I was due to receive? We shall repeat the manoeuvres in a year. And if you make no mistake commanding the army you shall receive the corps. I am never alone with you, father. Always there are strangers between us. I wish to be alone with you, father. What do you wish to tell me? One thing, father. Herhor is my foe. He accused me in front of you and exposed me to shame. Herhor is my faithful servant and your friend. Thanks to him you commanded the troops during the manoeuvres. He made the men march around beetles! Should a priest favour the army over the Gods? Father, so as not to disturb the scarabs, the canal was destroyed and a man perished. - That man took his own life. - But it was the fault of Herhor! 30 men died of exhaustion in the regiments you so skilfully mustered. And several hundred are sick. You speak not as a state dignitary who cares for canal-building and the lives of labourers - but a wrathful man. If wrath arouses me, it is because I see how Herhor and the priests hate me. Herhor will not even give me a corps. He wants to command the army! I command the army and the country. All orders and judgements flow from me. I act for Osiris in this world and make all decisions. Concerning my heir, my minister and my people. You are downcast, sire. We have been together a day, and I have not yet seen your smile. Cares are like a treasure to be hidden away. While we watch them ourselves, even sleep flees from us. Our elders teach that a man will even renounce rank for a woman. But a woman cannot help in serious difficulties. If she does not love like I love you, my lord. I know you love me, but... Can you make His Majesty appoint me commander? Can you even give me the corps I asked for? It is true I may not. I cannot do any of that. You may bring me cheer. Robe yourself like a Phoenician dancer, and dance and caress me like she would. We, daughters of Judah, may not dress immodestly. Nor dance, nor sing? Crying is the first voice of man on this Earth, and wailing the final farewell. Man enters a life full of woe, and enters the place of rest full of regrets. And no one asks where he would stay. Where is a man with no cares? Where is a man who lays himself to rest saying, "This was a day I spent without sadness". How you have changed. You are now a man. We meet so seldom I might forget your face, if I did not hold it in my heart. This is not good. Mother, such a greeting makes me afraid to present my request. - It must concern money then. - I need 10 talents. So your Jewess has become so greedy. No so. But I pledged the army a reward I cannot pay. Be cautious, Ramses. Those women would choose death before a stranger's bed. And if they ever lie with enemy commanders, it is only to achieve their ends or kill them. Those are priests' words! So you are the enemy of the priesthood! You, their beloved pupil. - I still bear their rods' marks. - Your grandfather was a High Priest! Because my grandfather and father were Pharaohs, I cannot endure Herhor's power! I see not the future ruler of Egypt in you. Who would remain if you drove the priests from the court? Who will be your eyes in the Lower and Upper Land? Abroad? The priesthood shall be my servants. Not ministers. Thanks to them, your father has reigned for 33 years - and avoided costly wars. - For priests! For the Pharaoh and country! Do you know what is happening to our treasures? I know! But I also know, that one successful war with Assyria could fill our coffers, as the Nile floods our fields! No. You, Ramses, are still a child. I will not even blame you for your impious words. Please, send the Jewess away and ask the priests to lend you the money. - I would sooner ask the Phoenicians. - Do as you wish. But remember, Pharaohs have died after a few months and great dynasties fallen. Because those Pharaohs favoured the incense burner over the spear. Ramses, this is Dagon, the most honest Phoenician - banker in all Memphis. - Greetings, new Sun of Egypt! May you live eternally, and your fame reach the distant shores, whither sail our Phoenician ships. When Thutmose told me that you wanted to see his slave, such joy entered me I would not let my chariot driver beat the donkeys. And I gave a ring to the slave who washed my hands. Your Royal Highness, how did you acquire that silver jug? - From Azarius, son of Gaben. - That Jew! Your Royal Highness trades with Jews? - He is a merchant like you. - O Baap Tamer! O Ashtoreth! Azarius a merchant like me? O my feet, why did you bring me here? Kill me, out off my hand if I ever cheated but do not say the son of Gaben is a merchant. Dagon, will you lend me 15 talents? Ashtoreth! 15 talents. That is such a burden I must sit down, in order to think it over properly. One talent is a huge sum. For how long, sire? For a year. I say at once: three years. Only His Majesty could pay it back in a year. Not a young prince, entertaining merry noblemen and beautiful women. O, those women! - At what interest? - A trifle, you need not trouble yourself with. For 15 talents Your Royal Highness will give... 5 talents a year, and after three years I take it all back. You loan me 15 talents and after three years take back 30? By law, the sum of the interest equals the loan! Is that not too much? Too much? I would be ashamed to take any less from the heir. - When will you bring it? - Bring it? I shall do better. I shall organise the payments, and you will not have to concern yourself with such vulgar matters. And you will lease me three farmsteads in Lower Egypt for three years. I must first ask how much profit they earn me. Your Highness does not trust me? No. But... So it is settled! Now we need a scribe and sixteen witnesses to confirm the transaction. Very well, - as long as it turns out well. - Wise words. May you live forever. My life passed without torment OI' care. Like a pleasant day by the River Jord... You were gone so long, sire. Hard years are coming for Egypt. Internal conflicts threaten us, which only wisdom and virtue can resolve. But worse. If you declare war on Assyria in the next 10 years, their army will destroy everything that has existed here for centuries. The Assyrians are a cruel people. You have cast a great fear on us, but not shown us salvation. Peace with Assyria. What are the conditions? Assyria will surrender Israel to you. And Phoenicia? Should Pharaoh attempt to seize Phoenicia, within a year Assyrian horses will be swimming in the Nile. Egypt cannot renounce claims on Phoenicia. If Egypt does not renounce Phoenicia, she is sure to fall, - and internal strife will quicken it. - What strife do you mean? You should know better than I, a foreigner. The people are downtrodden by the great. Piety is declining. Many people think about war on foreign soil. Conclude a treaty with Assyria. Amon knows how loathsome such a treaty would be to me. But if fate is really against us we will have to conclude a treaty. If my own son pushed Egypt towards war, I would crush my own son. If I hit it, I will humble Herhor. If I hit it... I will defeat the Assyrians. If I hit it, I will one day be Pharaoh like Ramses the Great. O Jehovah! Your mother is there. And if your honourable mother wishes to speak to you? My mother is very fond of song. You may win her over by singing a Jewish song. How great is the Lord, how great is the Lord... Do you see it? He is sailing to meet us with his Jewess! He would not be the son of high priests and pharaohs if he did not fight against our laws and possibly misguided customs. If he were not in that boat, I would destroy it! How great is the Lord, how great is the Lord, - Lord, o, Israel. - A pretty, stupid creature, who does not think and cannot influence the Prince. If only the omniscient Amun would speak through your mouth. The Prince has not lost his head over her. Sarah is with child, however... How do you know? And if it is a son? If it is a daughter, we will give her the dowry of a noblewoman. If it is a son, he will be a Jew. My grandson... A Jew? The time will come when Israel will need a king. Then we shall give them one. You are an eagle, who sees all with a single glance. I am grown weary. Were I not concerned for your tender years and the future of Egypt, I would die today. It gets worse every day. For that reason, Ramses, it is time for you to begin to rule. You must learn the exacting art of ruling a country and keep watch over your foes. May you attack them like an eagle swooping on a partridge. You want to lead the Delta Corps. From today, you are their commander. My father. Allow me, Honourable Prince, to congratulate you. Herhor insisted I gave you the greatest province. You have my gratitude, noble Herhor. Remember one thing, Prince. Kingly wisdom is a priestly secret; only a pious man may possess it. Let he, who enters here calm his soul. On behalf of He who created all. And gave life to all the creatures on it. I am the one who created the waters and the great deluge. I am the one who... Come with me. Who is the parent. I am the one, who created the Heavens. And the mysteries of the horizons, and put the souls of the Gods into them. I am the one, who makes it light when I open my eyes. And when I close them darkness falls. When I give the order the Nile flows. But the Gods do not know his name... Prince Hiram of the Phoenician High Council. Dagon, banker to Prince Ramses, heir to the throne. I, Hiram, greet you, sire. I wish you a wealthy life and great success. I, Dagon, greet you, sire. I wish you what you wish me. - You want to quarrel already! - Rabsun, - am I quarrelling? - Better only to speak of business. Why are you so aggrieved today? I should be called "The Honourable". And I "Your Highness" for I am a Prince. In Phoenicia, perhaps! In Assyria you would be nothing, like Phoenician trader. But what would you do with such a wild man who might impale you on a stake? In Egypt I share the same couch as the heir to the throne. I own a hundred ships. But His Majesty the Pharaoh, has 20 thousand cities, towns and villages. Typhon possessed you? You count Pharaoh's estates, - while trouble threatens Phoenicia? - I want to know what misfortune. Berossus! Berossus! Berossus. Advisor to the Assyrian Princes and the King. Berossus spent the night in the Temple of Ptah. Our spies said Assyria wants to seize Phoenicia and give Israel to Egypt. - Which is why Berossus is here. - Dagon, you could help at Pharaoh's court. And prevent the treaty - with Assyria being struck. - By myself? Never! - I stand by you. - Phoenicia will supply the gold. - What will I receive for my work? - What? 10 ships. - How much will you earn? - It is too little? - I'm asking how much! - I hope you breathe your last. I will give you twenty ships. So forget about the burnt ones. Very well, I will do it. To forget... - how much I might have earned! - Let us talk about Phoenicia. Ramses will soon become Pharaoh. And may start a war with Assyria. - But do not push him into a war. - Why, I cannot multiply myself! But make sure all the heirs' cooks want a war. All the heir's barbers, bath attendants, scribes, officers, and chariot drivers want a war with Assyria. And make sure Ramses hears it even when he sleeps. It will be done. - Do you know his mistress? - A silly girl! We could find him a clever one. I know one! Kama. The Phoenician priestess? Sacrilegious! Sacrilege by her, would mean death. May you be blessed, o Nile. O holy river, which springs up in this land. You come in peace to give life to Egypt. By the will of His Majesty the Pharaoh and the priesthood, you have learned many secrets about Egypt known to deities, the rulers of the country, and the temples. The wisdom of the Gods has shown you that not only the state coffers but also the army has diminished. And those sources of power will continue to diminish. Once, the coffers of the Pharaohs were full, we had land and people, when our land was rich and powerful. That was 400 years ago, before the 19th dynasty began its victorious, happy wars. Our soldiers defeated our enemies and our Pharaohs were esteemed as far as the Euphrates River. Our peasants worked like beasts of burden. Thousands of them fought and died. At the same time, the desert sands engulfed our lands. God speaks through you, Pentuer. Our triumphs became Egypt's tomb. This is today's Egypt, Ramses. These are today's peasants. Come closer, heir to the throne. Closer. Look! Skin and bones. They will not swell the coffers of your country, Ramses. Remember Egypt carries a venomous serpent in its breast. This serpent, sucking the blood of the people, the fortunes of the Nomarchs and the Pharaohs' power is the Phoenicians. The Phoenician gold trade. They take all this land and 32 people against a single talent of gold loaned for three years. Look how much land and how many people. Now look at my hand. This gold nugget is one talent. - Your countenance is not cheerful. - Be not wrathful, sire. The soldiers have not been paid for a week. They report that His Majesty's health has seriously declined. The priests told me nothing. But they say you pledged to drive out the Phoenicians. Can it be true? It is true, then. Poor Phoenicia. But also poor Egypt. - I do not understand your laments. - You do, since you decline to answer my question. But... I shall keep my promise. You shall have a hundred talents. You are concealing something from me. I would like you to explain. Assyria is to subjugate us. You have gone mad, honourable man. Assyria to seize Phoenicia? - What are we to do? We, Egypt? - Egypt has already agreed. A matter like this needs the Pharaoh's and my permission. And it will happen. The priests have concluded an agreement. - Which priests? - His reverence, Herhor, Pentuer, Mefres and High Priest Berossus, supported by King Assar. Beware, old man. You accuse the highest men of treason. You are mistaken, sire. The high priests and the minister of war have the right to strike deals with neighbouring powers. I will not believe your words, Your Reverence, until you prove it. The Assyrian delegate Sargon is due any day. He will seal what the priests decided. What reward will Assyria give Egypt? Those are words worthy of a king! That is a bad exchange for Egypt. Assyria will not only have Phoenicia, but almost all of Asia, and Egypt only gains Israel. If Pharaoh declared war on weak Assyria, and won it, he would have a huge, faithful army, 100,000 talents in unpaid tributes, and 100,000 talents from conquered countries. With that money he could buy back the properties held in pledge by the priests and take away their power. If a treaty existed, it would have to be a secret. One of the four priests would then be a traitor to Pharaoh, - and his (to-conspirators. - There may be a fifth, - who spied on them. - And sold you the secret. Pity you do not know the power of gold, sire. They would fear punishment, as servants of the Gods. I have seen many temples in many lands, and many great and small statues in them. - But I have never met any gods. - Blasphemy! I myself felt the God's touch. - Where? - In the temple. You lack experience, sire. Surrounded by a web of intrigue. I wish to give you one service. Come to the Temple of Ashtoreth one night. Come alone, and you will see. But do not betray me, nor yourself. The Gods may forgive the betrayal of their secrets. People - never. Ramses! Ramses! Ramses! Ramses! Who is it? I want to know. It is I. Kama. - Did you touch me with your hands? - Indeed. HOW? Thus. You are Kama? The priestess of the flame? Yes. And your laws are so cruel; they do not let you love? Were I to break the law, Phoenicia would curse me and the Gods would take their revenge. What concern are your Gods to me? Kama! Kama! - When did it happen? - When was your honourable son born? The second day of the feast of Seti. Herhor was present at the birth. - Thutmose! - Sire? Summon the regiments from the coast. I wish to inspect the troops. The Memphis Palace tells us you, o Prince, are to receive Sargon, emissary of King Assar, who has come with Priest lstubar to kiss the feet of his Royal Highness, your father. Very well. With pleasure. I shall ask them when Assyria will pay us its unpaid tribute. - Would Your Highness do that? - Absolutely. We need tributes and they do not want to pay. In the name of His Eminence Herhor, I forbid any such talk! What is your right, Priest, to talk to me in the tone of a superior? Herhor has nothing to say to me! One more word. Can you explain why Assyria should not pay the tributes, and refill the state treasury? Assyria's army is three times that of Egypt. I see. But if Egypt is so weak we may not even mention Assyrian tributes, how can we be sure the Assyrians will not attack us? Treaties can be used to defend us. There are no treaties for the weak! Treaties only have power when supported by spears and swords. Bring Sarah and my child here. I wish to see my son. Merciful Lord, you are a king, but you are also a good God, so you may not harm your priestess. I have waited outside your house several times. No one would guess my king was only a few steps from me. To what do I owe this great honour? Tell me why I was shown my living portrait in the temple. Because they love you, sire. And show you that if you are in danger and want to deceive your foe, you can have your own shadow. I would not survive by myself? Ramses the Great had two other bodies, apart from his own, for his foes. Those two shadows died but he lived. - You are beautiful. - I will die because of you, lord. - I will bring you to my palace. - I will be your slave, lord. But not today. And not here. Who told you I no longer love you? Do I know? An evil soothsayer and my own heart! - Sarah, you would cry the Nile out... - I will not. Your new soothsayer, frightening you with tales of Phoenician women. Not Phoenician women, but Phoenicia. They are wicked! I was told Phoenicia wants a war between Egypt and Assyria! Why would they want a war? Why? They will supply you and the Assyrians with weapons, goods and news, and expect to be paid for it! They will loot the slain and wounded. They will buy plundered goods and slaves from the soldiers. Egypt and Assyria will be ruined, and Phoenicia will have new treasures! The Phoenicians sting like a viper. If Ramses the Great used a lion in battle, then I can use a viper against Egypt's foes. I, Sargon, commander and kinsman of the most powerful King Assar, come to greet you, heir of the most powerful Pharaoh, bringing you gifts in friendship. Sire, the Venerable Sargon waits for your gracious reply. Answer him thus. Why does he speak to me as an equal? Urakata sela. - He is the cousin of King Assar. - And I am the son of the Pharaoh. - Lord, whither does this lead? - To war. May the emissaries rise. I shall not be happy till I have 100,000 severed Assyrian hands. Hiram sent a letter from your high priests. You will no longer serve Ashtoreth. You are free. Do you think it is gold? - Do you greet me thus? - I know my brothers. They counterfeit gold, rubies and sapphires! - Your safety is in this casket. - What do I care? I am bored and fearful! It is as if I were in prison! - Do you lack something? - Lack? I lack light, air, laughter, songs and people! O vengeful Goddess, how severely do you punish me! Do I not love you? ls the honour that you belong to me not enough? If you loved me, I would be the first lady! You would put me where the Jewess Sarah resides! And you would guard me - not her! By Ashtoreth's altar I was first! And here? What? All bow down before the Jewess! Before my firstborn son. And he is not a Jew. - He is! - You are insane. - You know my son cannot be a Jew. - And I tell you he is! He is a Jew, like his grandfathers! Like his uncles! His name is Isaac! Shall I be rid of you? Very well. Be rid of me, if ever I lied! But if I speak the truth, drive her away! Give me proof. Go to her. And ask. Your firstborn son is called Isaac. Isaac! Isaac! Isaac! Greetings, sire. Sarah, what is the name of your son? What is the name of your son! - Indeed, you know, sire. It is Seti. - Look me in the eyes. You lie! My son, the son of the Pharaoh's heir is called Isaac. And he is a Jew! A base Jew! - The priests ordered me thus. - Which priests? The Most Venerable Herhor and Mephres. They said he must become the first Jewish King! Herhor and Mephres. Herhor and Mephres! The Jewess is no longer a lady, but will serve the one who replaces her! Take her to join the slaves! God of Abraham, Jacob and Isaac, take pity on me! You swore you would run away with me. - Lykon. - If you become the Prince's mistress, - I will strangle you. - Let me go. Priestesses are for priests, not for strangers. You are also a stranger to us. I cannot be a stranger to you. Your priests created me. They taught me to walk like him. - Talk like him. - Be quiet. I hate him. Kama! You have never resembled the Prince as much as today. The politics of the priests has caused this. The Libyan regiments are demobilised and are burning villages. Hebron. Do not look at me like that. - I am happy, sire. - You will marry an elegant lord. You are wrong, sire. I am happy, but not because of my betrothal. Why then are you marrying Thutmose? I shall be nearer Your Highness. And be able to see you more, sire. Erpatre. Mephres and Mentezuphis ask to speak to you. - Will Your Highness hear us out? - You think I am in my cups? Go to Thutmose. Today the whole of Egypt is so insane, so stupid that drunks - have the most sense. - Does Your Highness know, that 5,000 Libyan soldiers are to be demobilised. I did not know. - You did not deign to inform me. - Your Highness questions the orders - of His Majesty the Pharaoh? - No! Not His Majesty, but those traitors who, taking advantage of my father's sickness, want to sell the country to Assyria. Let us, o Prince, return in a few hours. No. There is no need. I know what is happening on our Western border. Or rather not I, but my cooks do. And stable boys. And scullery maids. So perhaps you will deign, Honourable Fathers, to inform me of your plans. The Libyans are planning to attack Egypt. - I see. - The will of His Majesty and Minister Herhor is for Your Highness to gather your army and destroy the rebels. - Am I now commander-in-chief? - It is as you said. - I may join your councils of war? - This very moment. Be seated. Why have you demobilised the Libyan regiments? Others will be demobilised so His Majesty may earn 4,000 talents annually. And I thought you did that to please the King of Assyria. You astonish us, o Prince. The pharaohs' souls would be more astonished if they heard that in Egypt, where royal authority has been shackled, - a Chaldean trickster is plotting. - What you talking about? I speak of Berossus. The great secret of your temples! King Assar's spy has forced a shameful treaty on us. It could only be signed after losing everything in battle. Madmen! O, pious ones! Wake up, commander. Ramses... The army is waiting. Amun Ra... Osiris... Recharmahis! I am the one, who, when he opens his eyes, brings light! And when he closes them darkness falls. I am the God, Amun Ra. I am the one who created the Heavens and the Earth. And gave life to all the creatures on it. I am the God, Amun Ra. Live eternally, 0 our commander. Live eternally. Erpatre. It is the cry of an army that loves its victorious commander. I do not even know how I won it. Do you know, Tehenna, how Egypt punishes treason? I know I deserve death, sire. And I accept it on your decree. I am afraid the triumph has gone to the young lord's head. Perhaps we ought to stop it. No. Do not stop the celebrations. If I may, sire. Strange things have come to pass since you left the city. Your Phoenician Kama fled with the Greek Lykon. Do not be roused, sire. This Greek is an awful criminal. He is as like me as a reflection. And now the most terrible event. Remember that Egypt's foes cannot see your sadness. The Jewess Sarah, is dead. Your son is also dead. The Greek Lykon killed him. Hold your feelings, sire. As befits a triumphant commander. This place fills me with astonishment and regret. I once thought that I would build something more worthy than the pyramid of Cheops. But where would I get so much gold? So many people? Do not envy Cheops, sire. It took 30 years to build his tomb, and what was gained? Who did it heal? Or feed? Or clothe? Half a million died building it. How much blood, tears and pain? It is not if the pyramids were necessary... but that the will of the Pharaoh be done. Yes, Pentuer. The pyramid is not the tomb of Cheops, but his will. Do you, sire, wish to prove your power in a like manner? Why are you so kind to me, priest? The Gods warned me you could save the people of Egypt from their misery if you so wished. Why do you care for the people? I came from the people. My father and brothers took water from the Nile... and were beaten for it. - How may I help the people? - The people work too hard. Their taxes are too high. They are poor and downtrodden. The peasants! Always the peasants! For you, the only ones who deserve pity are those the lice bite. Why do you not count the pharaohs who were murdered? But you do not remember them. And my father? And I? Death is no more merciful to me than to your peasants. O Lord, o Lord... Why are they praying at this time? Tell me instead why they pray, since no one hears them. In peace to the West. O Lord, go in peace. We will see you again, when the day of eternity arises. For we shall go to the land which unites all people with you. To the West, to Osiris' chambers. You go to the West. To the West. The oxen that pull the funeral chariot. Our lord goes to the West after you. To the West, to the West, to the land of the just. Greetings, Pharaoh, ruler of the world. - What are you saying? - May God pour wisdom and strength on you, and happiness on your people. The oxen go to the West, pulling the funeral chariot. Greetings to you, Lord and Ruler of the world. And live eternally as Pharaoh Men-Mad-Re-Sechep- en-Ptah-Ramses XIII. According to the will of His Majesty my father and the laws of Egypt, I assume government in praise of the state and happiness of the people. I see you wear the golden serpent. Why do you wear the symbol of royal power? I ask you, Your Eminence. Why the royal serpent on your mitre? Egypt lacked a ruler for one day. During that difficult time I was ordered to bear the holy relics. So the government and servants could swiftly join the Gods. Your Majesty, please listen to my humble request. - The High Priests' Council speaks. - Go on. A pharaoh needs the high priest's blessing to fulfil his highest functions. The High Council begs Your Majesty to appoint a priest to substitute you in religious ceremonies. Thank you for reminding me of this. War and state matters prevent me from taking part in religious ceremonies. Thus I must appoint a substitute. Who are you, Your Eminence? Sem, High Priest in Hathor's Temple. You will be my substitute in religious ceremonies. What are you doing to the sleeping one, brother Anubis? Scraping the feet of my brother Osiris, so earthly dust will not soil the Heavens. He appears in the clouds, to separate Heaven from Earth, and then unite them. What are you doing to the sleeping one, brother Anubis? I am cleaning earthly matter from my brother Osiris, that he will be more beautiful. God incarnate in all things, the spirit of Shu in all the Gods. He is the body of a living man. That was a Nubian priest, who entered the Labyrinth during the times of Your Majesty's grandfather. The last person here was your father, Ramses XII. According to ancient custom and your will, we have brought you here, sire. It is the Labyrinth's chief treasury. All this is kept for times of danger? You speak the truth, Your Majesty. And who decides if such times have come? If they were to come? A meeting of native Egyptians must be called. The Pharaoh takes his place with 13 priests, 13 Nomarchs and 13 merchants, officers and peasants. You would give the treasure to that meeting? We would give the sum, if the entire meeting agreed that Egypt were in peril. I want to improve the lot of the Egyptian people. Firstly, by giving them a day of rest after six days of work. The people would bless you, sire. But the state would lose 10,000 talents a year. We have already reckoned that in the temple. You are right, Venerable Mephres. Which is why, holy men, I need help. You remain silent, Your Eminence? I cannot guess where we would get 30,000 talents. - The treasury of the Labyrinth? - Those are the treasures of the Gods. To be taken in times of great need. If not the people, then I need that sum. Your Majesty could gain more than 30,000 talents in a year. And Egypt twice as much. HOW? Expel the Phoenicians and demobilise the Libyan regiments, sire. If that is your counsel, I will do without it. Your forebears carved in granite, not on papyrus, that gifts given to the Gods will always belong to the Gods and the temples. And to you. As much to us, as the state belongs to you, Your Majesty. Pentuer. Stay here. Tell me. You are the son of peasants and you know there are fools among the priesthood. Tell me why you support them against me. For thousands of years the priesthood has cared for Egypt. And made the country what it is. How have they managed to do so, in spite of their faults? When they are the bowl in which the light of wisdom burns. Destroy that bowl and you might quench the light that has burned over Egypt and the world for thousands of years. I will not join the fight, because I would either betray you or God, the creator of wisdom. Be seated, Lykon. This is the price we can buy him with. Kama. - You have a good police force. - Better than in the Labyrinth. Appoint me chief guardian there, and you will have the best guards. Do you know why I summoned you? Take our lands and our families, but we have no money. Today Phoenicia is gathering gold and jewels to pay the Assyrians, according to the treaty your priests signed. They are still deceiving you, sire. They send letters to King Assar. I will deal with the priesthood's obedience. Give me proof that you speak the truth. Look, sire. Here is the truth. It is... High Priest Samentu, the man I spoke of, Your Majesty. You told Hiram of the treaty between our priests and Assyria. It was I. The temple walls are riddled with holes. You can hear what they saying in the cellars. - You detest the state of priesthood. - And they detest me. I serve Set, the God of evil. Can the priesthood be brought down? 400 years ago Pharaoh Amenhotep IV defeated the priests and took the treasures. No one stood up for the priests. - Who helped Amenhotep? - The simple priest Ey. Who inherited the throne after Amenhotep's death? That proves Amenhotep was a weak ruler. How would you get rid of the priests? By seizing the chief treasury of the Labyrinth. And then? By trying Herhor and Mephres with high treason. For keeping secret relations with Assyria. - What about proof? - Hiram sends secret letters. You are a true sage. The people love you, Your Majesty... and are sure to rise against the priests. The army is faithful to you, like to no other pharaoh. You have the Phoenicians, and the treasures of the Labyrinth. Could you find the Labyrinth? I have many clues, and will find the rest. I know where to look. The people are massed in front of the palace gates. Let us respect the ancient customs. Let the gate be opened. I permit everyone to stand. Guardian of the Labyrinth - step forward. Each delegate will receive two stones: a black and a white. Anyone wishing you to take the treasury of the Labyrinth, will choose the black stone. Anyone who does not wish it, will choose the white one. Have them throw the stones into the jug. If but one stone is white, they will not open the Labyrinth. I have more regiments than there will be votes against me. Open the Labyrinth. Release the gold of the Labyrinth. Open the Labyrinth. Here is my will. The crowd must attack the temple in two days. Prepare extra supplies of free wine and food. Tehenna, send four Libyan regiments to the Labyrinth. If the crowd threatens the Labyrinth, surround them with troops. You, Thutmose, deploy three regiments near the temples. Minor disturbances are permissible. The people may gather in front of the temples today. Let us imprison Herhor and Mephres at once. No. Hiram will give me Herhor's letters to the Assyrians in two days. I will have proof of his treason and be able to imprison them. The temples and Labyrinth are more important. I have been in the Labyrinth twice. But the treasury may be flooded at any moment. I will return there one more time. The army may not occupy the Labyrinth until I say. You have heard everything. Yes, sire. Show no mercy. Forgive neither Herhor nor Mephres. While they live, you may die. A lion may be soothed, a Phoenician bribed, a Libyan tied up, but an Egyptian priest, who has tasted luxury and power, is immune to anything. Your calm astonishes me. Almost the entire population is against us. The people are like barley - they go with the wind. And the army? What army will not fall before Osiris? I know. But I see neither Osiris nor the wind that will blow us support. - What have they to fear? - They will be afraid of Osiris. And the one who goes blind that day will be happy. Pharaoh wants the people to storm the temples. We need to speed up the attack. We must make sure they attack us tomorrow. Do not begrudge gold. The crowd must attack the temples at noon tomorrow. Remember. Tomorrow at noon. - No one can be here. - And yet... Think about Lykon. We must go further. Who goes there? What is happening? Was my soothsayer mistaken? When you cannot be a trickster, Mephres, you are only an idiot. And here you are a trickster and an idiot. A trickster, because you persuade people that rogue has second sight, and an idiot, because you think they believe you. Why don't you say you know the plan of the Labyrinth perfectly? You lie. I am here, for I found the plans in the Temple of Set. You found yours in the Temple of Ptah. Tie up that traitor and liar. Mephres... You will remain an idiot until your death. He can stay here. Like the others. Drink! Faithful Egyptians. Drink! To the health of our Lord. Drink, faithful Egyptians, to the health of our Lord. May he live forever. Long live Ramses XIII! The Statue of Isis turned its face to the wall. The water has gone as red as blood. One more proof of a traitor. When your army enters the temple great misfortune will befall Egypt. The audacity of the priests is a greater ill. Be merciful. If you break them you will destroy the wisdom that elevated us - over other peoples. - I do not want to harm them. Their wisdom and piety does not vex me, but Egypt's poverty, which starves and fears the Assyrians. Ramses. My son and dearest lord. Drive out the bad counsellors. You still have time. Speak! O Lord of the two worlds, the mob has begun to storm the temple. Give the order. The army is to seize the temples. They must be taken by noon. And Herhor and Mephres imprisoned. Your Majesty! There will soon be an eclipse. Repent, ye heathens. Whether a believer or a pagan, I beseech you in the name of the Gods to leave the temples alone. Open the gate. We want to know what treason you plot against our lord. - Release the gold of the Labyrinth. - My son... Prostrate yourself and beg the Gods to forgive your sacrilege. You beg the Gods to protect you! Down with the priests. O Gods! I entrust the holy temples, against which traitors and heretics are rising up, into your care. I turn my face away from this accursed people. And may darkness fall on the land. - That dark circle is the Moon? - So say the sages. - And the darkness will soon be over? - Certainly. I must restore to favour those who study the stars. Son! Son! My Son! My Son! On the soul of your father, on our Gods I implore you, humble yourself. Beg the Gods for forgiveness. My Son! Humble yourself, humble yourself... Humble yourself! Heathens! Osiris! Osiris... May your name be praised threefold! Osiris! Osiris! Have pity and show your face to the hapless people. I will listen to the prayers of the priesthood one more time, for I am merciful. If you wish to see Kama again, do as I say. Remember. - Who are you? - Guardian of the Labyrinth. You know the plans of the Labyrinth, as we do. Herhor sent you... I know I will not build a temple greater than Amun's nor a pyramid more splendid than Cheops'. I inherited a weak and sickly state. I must make it strong. And may it become a monument that will match the greatest in the memory. What will you do if Thutmose fails to capture the temples? I shall stow my crown in a chest, don my helmet and seize it myself. You do not even know, Hebron, what you mean to me. After your ministers and generals. I would like to have as many hands as leaves, as many mouths as flowers. So I might caress your eyes, your feet, your breasts all at once. For a king whose throne is endangered, you have strangely free thoughts. A moment's caress is worth a year of government. Open the gate for Thutmose. Herhor. High Priest of Amun of Thebes. You stand accused of high treason. The Pharaoh will judge you. If the young lord wishes to learn the plans of the eternally living Ramses XII, let him approach the High Council. I summon you to follow me, if you do not want me to make you. May the Gods protect you from the punishment you deserve. - Are you coming? - I wait here for Ramses. Then wait!
