LAST EPISODE... I don't care if you're a man or a woman. All I know is that I love you. What's next? Move in with me. Great, I'll move in tomorrow. But I won't live downstairs. Every night, I want to sleep with your arms around me. Promise? Silly girl. It's a deal then. What's the matter? The elevator is stuck again! Didn't you say that you would be fine with me around? DAY 1 OF LIVING TOGETHER... -Put it here. -Donâ€™t sit there! Sam, why aren't you helping out? -I thought you lived in the outskirts. -That's right! But it feels like you're bringing an entire shopping mall. Hey, watch out! Who are these people? Nothing tops my number one idol. ROSE FAN LAST TANGO Hey, where have you been? Awesome. This is amazing! Hey, I'm not a delivery boy. I'm actually moving in. Where's the kitchen? -Last door to your left. -All right. That's Fish, my best friend. Do you remember him? Sam, today is June 10. Right now, it's 3:40 p.m. From now on, we'll start a new life together. Hey, man. Hey! Sam. I didn't hear you coming in. You scared me to death. I'll walk louder then. Walk louder! Walk louder! Open sesame! Close sesame! What is it with you guys? Fish, he's used to living alone! Walk louder next time! What a scary cat. Bony. -Why is she crazy for you? -Wait up! What are you looking at? -What about you? -What about me? I'm her man, while you're only her friend. But I knew her first. What are you doing? Relieving myself. What? It's not easy being a man. How are you guys doing? "We have troubles with the new place." What are you saying? You're living in a big house like this, yet you are complaining. "We're not complaining." "We're just not used to it." "I miss the noise of the airplane." Hey. Take Sam's snoring for a change. All right? "I miss the hawkers down the alley." Hey, that's just silly. "Don't tell me that you don't miss them." Well, I do. However, this is the happiest moment of my life. Even though it's too big and neat here, and I have to walk around loudly, as long as Sam is here, I have no complaints. I really love Sam. I'm the luckiest girl. "Aren't you ashamed of yourself?" Not really. "Do you want to throw up?" Not really. Did I wake you? What are you doing up? You'll lose your mind if you keep talking to them. Talk to me instead. -Really? -Yes. Will you be free tomorrow? I probably will. We'll talk tomorrow, let's sleep. Okay. I was thinking of refurbishing the house. This is your place too. Do whatever you want. You don't have to ask me. What? What is this? Move it. Can't you see that we're working? Move it. Fish, what is this mess? We're refurbishing. -Refurbishing? -No. -It's a major overhaul. -When did I decide on that? -Where should we put the books? -Right here. What book? This is a big house. It's different from the ordinary refurbishing. -Hey! -That won't do! -Good morning, you're up early. -Hey. Do whatever you want, but don't touch my study. Didn't you say that this is my place too? From now on, whatever you do, you have to ask me first. A jacuzzi tub for lovers! Yes! Right here! That's awesome. In there! THE STORY OF THE ROSE I read your book twice. It's a page-turner. Thank you, Rose. Can I have your autograph? -Thank you. -Thank you. Rose. Rose! Wing! -I love reunions! -I'm so happy. Hey! -Who is he? -Hey. He's Fish. How's Sam? Great. Only you have a spell over him. Didn't you put out a record? Why didn't you continue? I used to be a "Man". Look at me now. Do I look like a female singer? Fix that. It's very easy. You have to be kidding me! I have a back problem. I can't have two water balloons up my chest while singing and dancing. You're full of crap. Thank you. I'm really busy these days. How busy? I have to cook, wash and iron the clothes, feed the dogs... What can you say about that? -I guess you are busy. -Yes. But that doesn't sound like Sam's type at all. -Hey! -Fish. Well, it will work out. The important thing is that everyone is happy, right? I'm happy. I believe Sam is happy too. Sam! Hey! Sam, what's wrong? -What's the matter with you? -I want you! -Stop! -I want you! Stop it! Hey! What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? You like girls like this. It's all in the book. What book? The story of Rose. What? She writes? She can't even spell. -She... -What rights does she have? The first half is before she met you, -while the second half is after that. -Hey! Then... Wait! Where are you going? It's a real tear-jerker! I'm calling my lawyer and I'll put an injunction to the book. Is she out of her mind? -You don't have to. -Why? It's a sold-out, all 400,000 copies. Shit. You just swore. -What? -Of course, I would swear. This is totally insane. There are 400,000 people out there all over my private life. It's illegal, she needs my permission. But she wrote great things about you. Take a look. You're her hero! -Really? -Yes. Wait a second, I can't read this. Am I crazy? I don't need to read about myself. You're right. -Am I? -Yes. You shouldn't read it too. Now that we're living together, you don't need to read about me from another woman's book. You should know me well enough. -I hope so. -You better. In short, both of us should not read the book. So do you prefer women with big breasts? Well, yes. Then you don't like mine, given how tiny they are. I didn't say that. -But you said like big breasts. -Thing is... Big is... Big is good, it's dynamic, but small is okay. It's cute too. Do you understand? It's true that I like big breasts, but I love you. That means you love me, but you don't like me. What? What date is it? June 20. What time is it? It's 8:20 p.m. -Is it 8:20 p.m.? -Yes. -My darling. -Yes? It has only been ten days and it's such a short time. We should give ourselves more time to decide if our relationship will work. What if it doesn't work? Then we'll make it work. -I promise. -Really? Okay. -I trust you. -Just trust me. Don't mess with me. Let me take a closer look. They're stuffed. But they look real. They're... You know. -Do you like them? -Of course. They look great. That's enough, you can go. I can't sing in the morning, but I sing better at night. Turn around. You may go. What are you doing? Are you making a pass at me? You are a creep! A straight pretending to be gay! What are you thinking? No, Auntie. I... I am... I'm really gay. Get out. Yes, Auntie. A singer? With that voice? I can't believe it. What a screwed up world. Emma, the guy who just left, call him for a second audition. -Hey. -What? What are you doing? It's nothing, he's actually okay. I know that he doesn't have a great voice, But he is cute. Our options are limited. We need someone who can sing. You know. Not every record can be a hit. What's wrong? Not again! I think I'm in trouble again. Ever since she moved in, she has turned my life upside down. I can't even compose these days. I really can't live with another person. It's tough living with someone. If it's tough on you, I bet it's tougher on her. -Hey. -What? Can I perhaps move back into Rose's apartment downstairs? No problem, but in three years' time. I just rented it under a three-year contract. The tenant is a foreigner. -Are you serious? -Hey. But you told me to. It's tough working for you. You better get yourself another Auntie. Sam, stop being a child. You were the one who asked her to move in, yet now you're trying to move out. I'm not moving out, it's only downstairs. Just like the old days when I was with Rose. More space for both of us. Who knows, I'll even come to love her more. I get it. First, you find a woman and marry her. Then you divorce her the next day, only to continue dating her. Basically, you're doing all this just to love her more. Do you think it will work? Theoretically, it works. But practically, it doesn't. You can solve this problem of yours by keeping her busy. Okay? Think about it. Keep her busy? I haven't disappeared. I was studying music at Juilliard, all the while saving Michael Jackson's marriage. Then I went to visit Madonna, dropped by London, and I even wrote a song for the Cocteau Twins. In fact, I had a cameo on George Michaels' MTV, but now I'm here to stay. Darn it, did I miss anything? Great, my boy! Are you serious? Nobody will believe all those crap. If they believe that she's a man, then they'll believe anything! She'll be the toast of the town. You're full of baloney! Please look here! IN LOVE WITH THE LEGEND Today, we are really honored to have the hottest singer, Wing, for our interview. Please feel free to ask him any questions! Few have claimed that Wing is Fan Fan's counterpart. Do you agree with this? You're great. Do you really think that he's handsome? Thank you. Fan Fan's phenomenon has brought androgyny to Hong Kong's pop culture. She was the biggest and brightest star, who dresses like a man. How do you see yourself, Wing? How can I compare myself to my number one idol? Ever since I was a kid, I have been her biggest fan. I have collected all of her records and news clippings. Hong Kong. Come here, very good. Look this way. WEEKLY MAGAZINE I want to thank the security guard downstairs, the old lady who sells newspapers, -and... -What about me? Don't leave out my name! Or else I'll quit. I want to thank Fish -and there's... -Hey, what is this? -Did you tell others about our hot-tub? -There's also... Be quiet. Not to forget my goldfish and my buddy, Bo Bo. Who else do I have to thank? You don't have to thank every Tom, Dick, and Harry. It's important to be direct on stage, so don't look around. You just have to thank the audience. Don't call me honey in front of everyone. Wing is downstairs, quickly get ready! Did you hear what I just said? Wing is already downstairs! Excuse me. Wing is here! -Wing is here! -Can you hear me? Wing is here! -Please move, Wing is here! -I heard that. Wing is here! -Wing! -Wing! -Wing! -Wing! -Wing! -Wing! -Thank you. -I like you too. Am I pretty? Wing, it's your money. Your big mansion and fancy cars. I really pity your parents. You're too fat to be a fan. You look just like a pig. -You look like youâ€™re crazy. -Iâ€™m your biggest fan! No way! -Wing, I've waited a long time for you! -Hey, get out! Get out! -Your fans are crazy. -Look at this! This is very expensive! -Wing! -Wing! -Wing! -Wing! -Wing! -Wing! Wing! -You have to be good to Wing! -Hey! -If not, I'll kill you! -Hey, let go! Has Wing bought you a house? Several critics said that you're "The new comrade of the era". It seems that your new piece, "Gay Man Forties" will be out? Several claimed that Wing gave you a hefty 30 million cash, is that true? -Wing! -Wing! That's Wing! -I wish to go to your concert. -Really? -May I have a ticket? -Sure. -Your tickets are hard to get! -I love you! -Wing! -This is for you! -The show is starting, please go back. -Wing! -Get back to your seats! -Wing! -Emil Chow! -Go back. I love listening to you sing! Your songs are wonderful! -I'm serious! -Thank you. Don't mention it. Can I have your signature? Please write down, "To Wing". My name is Wing, please don't forget me. Of course, I won't. I've listened to your last release. -You know who I am! -That's right. -Of course, I do. -Thank you! Sam loves your songs. -Yes, Sam and I are friends. -Really? Where is he? Sam? Sam! Sam! Sam! Hi, Emil. Sam is so far away. -Sam, let's change seats. -What? There's no need. Come on, let's change. There's really no need, thank you. Thank you so much! -Don't worry about it. -You are a star, -Come here, have this seat. -yet you're so nice. All right. -Sam. -What? My idol Fan Fan is coming tonight. I know. Ladies and Gentlemen, in every generation, there is a phenomenal star. The winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award tonight is the star of all stars. That's right, it's Miss Fan Fan. Fan Fan stepped into the music industry at age 5. At 6, she recorded her first single album. In the following 15 years, she has released a total of 28 albums. That's right, at the height of her career, she has decided to retire from the limelight. She had entirely vanished from the entertainment industry. From then on, nobody knew her whereabouts. She was spotted every now and then. She was once seen in Rio, dancing the Samba with four pineapples. In 1989, she was spotted windsurfing near an island in the South Pacific. In 1992, however, she helped war orphans, by feeding them in the midst of a war zone in Mozambique. So where exactly is she? No one knows. Don't worry, she is here tonight. That's right, it's the legend of all legends. We present to you, Miss Fan Fan! Yes, let's welcome a brand new image, a never seen before Fan Fan... New... Hey! What's your name? It's none of your business, asshole. My name is Fish, nice to meet you! What's your name? O! What? O! O. Last but not least, for the category of Best Male Vocal Artist year 1996, the winner is... Wing! Thank you! Congratulations. -Go and take your award. -The award. Sam, let's go together. Go. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I have a lot of people to thank, but my producer asked me to make it short and quick. So I'll just thank one person. It's you. You don't have to look around. Thank you. One, two, three! -Wing! -Wing! -Wing! -Back off! -Wing! -You forgot me! -Wing! -Wing! Wing! Don't forget me! Someone touched me! -Wing! -Wing! You're crazy, you animals. Start driving! -Where's Sam? Slow down! -Wait! Hey, where's Sam? -Forget him, he'll manage. -Sam! Keep driving, let him take the cab. -Wing! -Wing! Hey! Wait for me! -It's Sam! -Sam! O! O! Fan Fan, I'm here! -I won't pick up awards for you anymore. -How was it? There wasn't even a single baby backstage. Hey, who's living upstairs? He's noisy. Nobody that I know of. -It sounds like a bunch of creeps. -How would you know? But it seems like the creeps are having a party upstairs. A party? This is my house, what's the matter with you? Make up your mind. Do not regret this, I'm going to show you some muscles. Don't... What is it? Fish, where's Wing? Hey, Mr. I'm not Fish, I'm... Okay, where the hell is Wing? I have been looking all over for her. I saw her running around in a zebra suit a while ago, but God knows where she is right now. Okay, carry on. Auntie! You can recognize me in this? Of course, who can miss that fat butt of yours? Have you seen Sam? Goodness, I throw this party so that you can meet more people. Not to be stuck with Sam 24 hours a day, do you get it? Go make some new friends. Just go! Look at those lips! What a man! I'm coming! With all these masks, I can't even tell a man from a woman. I don't want to hit on the wrong person. You've never been with a man, yet you insist on liking women. How can you be so sure? You've never been with a woman, yet you insist on liking men. Sam! Wing! Wing! Sam! What is so funny? You've turned the house into a mess. I thought you wanted me to meet more people. I told you to meet more people, not to bring them home. -Then I'll just ask them to leave. -Wait. -Just don't do it again. -I'll go get you a drink. I thought Sam Koo hate parties. He's not the boss around here, Wing is the one paying all the bills. He hasn't written a song for six months. Sam would be down and out by now, if not for Wing. What did you say? Who is the boss? What do you know about composing songs? I'll play with you. I have had enough of this. I'm going to Africa, so are you coming? But I just came back from Africa last week. Sorry, I took you for someone else. What else do you want to listen to? -Africa, tell me about Africa. -Africa? Close your eyes and let your imagination run. Imagine a whole bunch of women, all naked, running wild. It was crazy. Then there's a group of men, fighting the lions by ripping off their skin. There was blood everywhere. All on the ground. The women even slept next to that. -Do you want to know? -What? There were giraffes too. Suddenly, they were behind you. Also, Paul Simon's music. "Under the African Sky"! -Yes! -Yes! Sam! -Sam! -Fan Fan! I have gotten a girl, so don't wait for me. Who was waiting for you? This is a crazy party! Sam! How exciting. Where are we going? Mission Impossible? Hey. This is a strange place. It even has a basement. Is this a dungeon or something? I have brought wine, Sam! Sam! Dim sum. -Sweet and sour pork. -Yes. Roast pigeon. Fried clams at Aberdeen. Delicious! And Sam Koo's "Chase". Don't you know who Sam Koo is? Hey. He is Hong Kong's number one composer. He writes the greatest songs, but he's gay. What? Isn't he gay? He's not gay. Yes, he is. Say that again and I'll... He's gay. I'll prove that he's not gay! I miss you, Sam. Why would you do that? Just let her call you gay. It won't hurt. It's the alcohol. I'm back. Sam! Do you have a party hangover? That's right. Did you get these for me? They're beautiful! Move it, you're in my way! Sam. Look who's here. Hey, I'm right behind you! Hey! Sam! Don't move. Fan Fan can tell your fortune by feeling your body. -What are you saying? -How is his career? -I hate this. -It's good. -How about family? -Good. Then it's fine, what else do you want to know? There's one more thing, love. It seems like... What is it? Good. How about his health? Hold up! Can you tell if he's healthy only from that? -Let me... -Hey, stop touching! -I want to touch it too. -Stop that. Hey! Let's see how many kids he'll have. -That's enough. -Sam. What were you dressed as at the party? -He was a... -Hey! A geoduck. Fan Fan. Can you really tell if a guy will have kids by touching him there? Geoduck. Whatever it is, deny it. I'm right behind you. When I'm being quiet, I scare you. When I make a noise, I still scare you. Are you a man? Crazy. Every time I see something good, I get goosebumps. Feel it. Hey, are you taking advantage of me? I have a black belt in karate. You grabbed my hand first. Do you have wet dreams sometimes? Of course. I have them all the time. Guess the girl who was in my wet dream last night. -Christie Chung. -Come on! I had her in my dreams last week. Her butt is really cute. Wait, but Chung is a woman. So? Of course, I like her smooth butt better. I wouldn't like a hairy one like yours. -I don't like it. -A hairy butt has its good points too. Are you already asleep? Not yet. I snore to put myself to sleep. Do you want to talk? I'll chat with you. Aren't you tired? Shouldn't you be the one who is tired? You were on the phone the whole day. A little bit. Do you want to know what we talked about? No. But you can tell me if you want. No, don't tell me. You should have your own secrets. That's right, I'm an adult now. You know, I get along with Fan Fan very well. She has been to a lot of places, so she knows a lot. Do you know that she has been to Africa? We can talk for weeks. Of course, she's so old, yet rich and free. She can go anywhere. You're old too, but you've never been to Africa. I have to make money to put food on the table. There's no need, Auntie said my records are selling well. I'm making enough for both of us. Anyway, you don't have any inspirations lately, so don't compose. Let's go to Africa, I'll pay for everything. I'm going to bed. Hey. What? Hey. Didn't you say that you want to go to Africa? Enough with that. You better move elsewhere. But it doesn't seem like she's selling me out. If she wants to, Wing would have known about it by now. There are only two types of women. One, those who treat you as disposable underwear. Only after one use, it goes into the trash. Me? No way. If not, then she still has feelings for you. She doesn't want it to be over soon. Hey. You're kidding, it can't be. You're such a chicken. You should go down and talk to her. Go down? That's dangerous. Are you scared? Are you scared that if you see her again, you won't be able to control yourself? You're crazy. Tell me the truth. Were there fireworks that night? You're bad. Honestly, it was an amazing night. I wonder how she feels. You lied to me! -You have something going on with her! -Wait up. Do you think I won't know if you don't say anything? -I am suffering! -Who told you? -Listen! -I don't want to! Mr. Lam, I think green is better for the study. This one, it's brighter. Lovely. -Hey, let me explain. -No! You don't have to explain! You've been lying to me! -How much have I done for you? -Do you want the ceilings painted? There's no need to paint them, just do the walls. Tell me what I should do! What have I done wrong? Tell me, what can I do? Calm down! -What game are you playing? -How did you know that I am? I have accepted a role in a movie. -Cut! -Fish. Can you do it again from the beginning to the end? You always stop in the middle. How can you get an Oscar? How can you be compared to Sharon Stone? I was going to insist, but I... I have to find my mark and also to be in the mood. Did you record it? What do you mean by recording? I have to practice too. I'm not professional. I don't even know which button to press. How about this? What is this button for? This, I don't know this word. Ask Sam. Read the manual. Go read the manual. That's strange, your reaction was good. Did you know that I was rehearsing? Tell me what I don't know. Hey, a movie? What movie it is? I've accepted a crossdressing role, as the leading actress. You sure have guts. What if they know that you're a girl... They won't! How would they know? I'm meeting someone, let's talk later. -Hey! -Hey. I've read the entire manual, but I still can't find the button. You're a pain. Do you know German? No. French? English? I've only learned the letter "S". Okay. Then even I can't help you. Hey! Who is she meeting? Do you know Joan? How about Linda? Okay. I can't help you. Joan? You are really "S" today. What is "S"? You sure know how to sweet-talk. Of course, now where do you intend to take me today? I hate to make plans. That makes life more interesting. Whatever will be will be. -Fan Fan. -Yes? I have something to tell you. Just say it. I have something to discuss with you. -Listen to me first. -I am listening. Don't fool around, all right? Fan Fan. This is the stage. I was five when I sang and danced on that stage. Then there he was, waving me over. "You'll be a star," he said. He's right. Fan Fan, who was the one waving at you? It was Bruce Lee. You've seen Bruce Lee? You better not be pulling my legs. I have something to tell you, Fan Fan. Fan Fan? Yes, I would not be here today if not for her. Who are you talking about? Fong Fong. Fong Fong? Yes, she taught me a lot. Then she helped me change my name to Fan Fan. Fan and Fong, they sound good together. What's your real name? Nothing's changed, you just have to spell it backward. Naf Naf! It sounds good! -Do you think so too? -Yes! -The fortune-teller said the same thing. -Really? He said if I were to use my real name, I would be famous. However, my love life is not that good. -What about Fan Fan? -Even worse. Is Wing your real name? Of course, Wing is not my real name. My real name sounds masculine. What's your name? Lam Chi-cheung! Then what? You don't know how to sing, yet you pretend to be a singer. That's what Sam says about me. I would like to discuss something with you. If not for Bruce, I would just be an ordinary person. Then I'll be much happier. But you're doing well now. You're famous and wealthy. However, you have something that I don't. What is it? A normal childhood. Everyone has that. When you were skipping rope, I was learning how to dance. When you were studying, I was backstage learning lines. When everyone is talking about their first love, I have already played the bride 18 times in the movies, singing scores of love songs. If I could have my innocence and first love, that would be great. Why can't you? It's because I am now Fan Fan. I'm no longer Naf Naf. I still think of myself as Lam Chi-cheung in the skid road. How about this? I let you choose. What kind of first love would you like? Like a rabbit. Kind. Simple. Innocent. There is someone. Really? Who's your first love? Sam. But he's not like a little rabbit. Don't talk about him, Fan Fan. Actually, I have something to discuss with you. I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend. Sam doesn't like people thinking that he's gay. If I have a girlfriend, no one would say that he's gay anymore. Why are you so good to Sam? It's because he's good to me. Really? Sam, open the door! Sam, open the door! Mr. Koo, open up! You're already in, don't wake the neighbors up. I like to wake you up, it makes me happy. It makes me so happy. -It so late and you didn't call. -So happy. You told me that I don't have to call you. You said that I'm not a kid and I have my space. -You have yours. -What are you doing? -Sit down! -Let go. -You're as drunk as a skunk. -No, I'm not. Why should I listen to you? No. It's a chimney! Is there anyone there? -Go to sleep. -Let go, I don't want to. You can go to sleep, but I don't want to. I want an apple. Do you want some? It's very crispy. Who were you with? Why do I have to tell you? Bitch. Are you calling me a bitch? Yes, I was with Fan Fan. Bitch. That's right, Fan Fan even said that my song, "Chase" is very good. Do you have no shame? I composed that song for you. You're crazy! If I didn't start it, you would have not composed it. In fact, Fan Fan also said that she has never seen anyone with a star quality like me. -Are you okay? -What do you think? All right! What's the matter? The toilet is this way. You're so drunk that I feel like hitting you. -Sam. -What? Why did you hit me? I had a dream that you hit me and you even told me to go to hell. It was only a dream. Go back to sleep. If it's just a dream, then why does my back hurt? I'll massage it a little, then it would no longer hurt. -Do you feel better now? -Yes. Go to sleep, be good. Sleep. -Sam! -Yes? Do you remember me asking you? -Who should die between the two of us? -Yes? How come you never asked me? Ask me now. Do you want to die or do you want me to die? I'll choose to die. Okay, then you should die. Are you not happy? I've decided to die for you. I am. I'm happy, okay? Go to sleep, it's late. Be good. Don't cry. I know that for a 20-year relationship... It's not fair, but... But I have met a girl I like. I shouldn't give up. You should think about me, do you understand? It's not me who don't like you, it's... It's her who hates you. You're only going away for one or two months. I will still love you and I won't leave you. Okay? Then it's decided. I'll give you some shaving cream. It will be in one stroke. Just like an injection, there won't be any pain. It will be very quick. FAN AND WING GOT TOGETHER KOO IS DUMPED Wing! Wing! What? Look at this. They have fallen into my trap. Did you tell them to write this? Yes. Don't you know that I begged Fan Fan to pretend to be my girlfriend? Now no one would say that you're gay. This is not okay. -Why not? -If you're the one who wrote this, then doesn't it mean that you're dumping me? That's not the truth, how is that possible? You know that I love you, right? Readers don't know what's real. They believe what they read. If you keep doing this, Fan Fan would eventually find out that you're a woman. I can always deny it. -Deny it? -Yes. Even if she takes off all of my clothes, I can still deny it. -You can still deny? -Yes, you were the one who taught me. We're just making friends. I'll keep my distance. Don't worry, I'm smart. I'm going to work, you should stay at home and compose. If you're bored, go for a shopping with Auntie or see a movie. I'll come back right after work, okay? Hey. Your glasses. I forgot, I'm not coming back tonight. You're not coming back? Then where are you going? I'm going to Fan Fan's. I want to read the script with her. -I'll be on early shift tomorrow morning. -Come here. I don't want to wake you up. Fan Fan said that she might move. If she moves, why don't I move downstairs? Then we would have our own space, right? -Let me... -I don't have the time to talk. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? -Good morning. -Good morning. How are you? Why are you so upset this morning? Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. Look, how nice! Turn around. -Come here, take the seat. -Okay. I'll help you. Stand up, be careful! -It's okay. -Do you really think she's teaching you? -She's just coming onto you. -Don't listen to him. If your parents know that you're with a lesbian, your parents will be upset, so will your grandparents. Your friends will look down on you, so will your relatives and the society. Think about it, you can't even have children! Save it, she has left. You won't even get a seat in the subway. That's enough! Why don't you start liking guys? You look pretty dressed as a girl. Really? Nobody ever said that to me. It's too bad that Sam is not here. Remember to tell him next time. It's Sam again. Between Sam and I, who do you think is more handsome? Let me see. You're more handsome. You have style, but Sam is manly. You always compare me to a man. I can't win. You lack one thing. What is it? A glowing rod? Yes, it's useful. Put it at the right place and you will become powerful. Will it glow in the dark? Of course not. You won't be a man just because you have a man's haircut, or you wear men's clothing, even some fake mustaches. -Then how? -You have to feel the ultimate manhood. With it, regardless of whether you're sitting or standing. You'll even think like a man. Really? Of course. I'll help you, come here. You can't do it yourself. All right. Hey. Aren't you helping me? I'll ask someone else to do it for you. Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean. Atlantic City. Atlantic City. What? O! What? I heard from Fish that you're crooked. What? I'm not. No. -Don't you like women? -Yes! -I have a question for you. -Yes? I have a friend. Her boyfriend and her are good together, but recently, she has been thinking -about another woman. -Hey! Does she know how to rollerblade? Is she pretty? She's not bad. Forget it. Hey, I'm not done. O! -O! -Yes? I want to know what it's like to like a girl. First, they would cut their hair short. Then they would wear men's clothes, pretending to be a man. After that, hiccups would follow suit. Yes, just like that. I don't have it. Lastly, when your eyes are closed, you can only see pretty girls. Feel it. It's not as hairy. Is it smooth enough? Close your eyes and try to imagine. Close your eyes. Does it feel like a woman's? A woman. No way! This side hasn't been shaved, it'll be better once it is shaved! Wait, it will feel like a woman's leg! No. Let me shave the other leg! No, I can see your face and smell your manly body odor. Fish. I don't think you can force your feelings on her. What do you know? I shaved my leg for her! Would you shave for Wing? So noisy. Please let me through. Mr. Koo, please wait. Wait, Mr. Koo. We'll all go down. Yes, come back soon. Mr. Koo! I'm sorry. Don't worry. -Actually the party that night... -I... That was an exception. An exception. Of course. It was an exception for me too. Right, of course. It's a secret. A secret. Come up for a drink whenever you have the time. Okay, but I won't wear a mask. Of course. Geoduck. FAN FAN, SAM I want to see Sam! It's Fan Fan again. Damn it. She didn't wear any clothes this time. Sam! This time I want to see Sam! Sam! Sam. It's still Fan Fan. No. Even this ugly woman makes me hiccup. No way. I'll never be straight again. Why does this elevator take so long? Did you press the button? Did you not? No, I didn't. What's that? We are stuck! Hey! What's wrong? -I'm scared! -Don't be scared! -I'm scared as well! -It's scary! Don't be scared! Why do you have a glowing rod? It's a given. I have been trapped in this elevator over 30 times, so I'm well-prepared. This will only last for half an hour. Feel this pocket. Can you feel that? What did you put inside there? I was trapped here once for five hours. That's why there are nine of them, so don't worry. She sells seashells by the seashore! What's wrong? That's so weird. Really? Well, Wing taught me. -No one dances like this anymore. -Really? Of course. Currently, it's this dance. She sells seashells by the seashore! Amazing, how exciting. Hey, teach me. Teach me. -I'll get it if you teach me three times. -Really? Come. One, two, three. -She sells seashells by the seashore! -She sells seashells by the seashore! Geoduck! This is very comfortable. Don't move even if it's comfortable. I've always been the one to massage Sam. But being massaged instead is so comfortable. If you like it, then come down more often. Why are you so good to me? It's because you're good to me. We can still be friends without love. Fan Fan, you're so understanding. Perhaps is it easier to talk to women? I find talking to you to be more comfortable than with Sam. Men and women are different. What's the difference? When men like someone, they would make themselves happy. When women like someone, they would make their partner happy. Naturally, they too would feel happy. That's true. I always want to do things that would make Sam happy. If he's happy, then I am too. That's why I believe that you're not a man. Am I not like a man? I'm saying that you don't have their faults. No. As of lately, I can feel that Sam is not that happy. We weren't like this before. We used to be very happy. Is it because I moved in with him? But he asked me to move in with him. Maybe it's because I have two left feet. Sam never lived with anyone before. He had never lived with anyone. He sacrificed a lot for me. He said I was bored at home, so I started singing again. Once again, I have my own career. So I entered the entertainment industry and became an instant hit. After a few awards, Sam suddenly told me... He told me not to sing anymore. He said my job is too tough and gives me great pressure! He worries that others think he's gay. It's okay, since I don't really like singing. So I said to him, "Let's go to Africa." That was his dream and he's been wanting to go there. But suddenly, he told me to never to mention Africa again! Never again! I don't know what's on his mind. At times he would say "yes", then he would say "no". He would say "go", only to say "don't go" later. I really don't know what to do. But I feel very lucky. Really. Sorry, I don't know what I'm saying. I'm really happy. Believe me. He has been good to me. I'm only crying because I'm happy. It's not that I'm unhappy. Do you understand? Do you think he's good to me? Thank you. Fan Fan. What? Why are you crying? I'm not crying. I'm laughing. Do you know how happy I am? There is still a little rabbit in the world. If only I could have one just like you, that would be great. It would be perfect if you and Sam are one person. If only you were not gay. When I was trapped in the elevator with you, I was suddenly inspired and wrote a song. -Really? -Really. I'll go in and play it for you. I'm in my nightgown, so it's not convenient. How about next time? -Okay. -Thank you. Good night. It feels good. It feels so good. Fan Fan. I want you to kiss me. Kiss me. Kiss. A kiss. Kiss me. Fan Fan. Kiss me. I'm a little rabbit, so please kiss me. Fan Fan. A kiss. A kiss. Fan Fan. -Fan Fan. -"Fan Fan"? A kiss. "A kiss"? Hey. It's fresh. Don't act like this. Why can't we be friends? No, how can men and women be friends? You can treat me as a man. Don't force me. You force me to be your friend, but I can't force you to make love. Where is the reasoning? Do you want it or not? Forget it. Don't force yourself. Just once, only one time. I've said it before... -You don't even listen to me. -A half time. How can there be a half time? Let's just sleep through the night. -What does that mean? -We will only sleep. Why not? What else can I do? You guys seem to like dancing. Mr. Koo, give us some pointers. -It's not bad. -Thank you. Mr. Koo! I picked up a piece of paper. Is it your poker record? We don't gamble at home. It has "Fan" and "Sam" written on it. Thank you. You were supposed to say, "Everybody hit the beat out". Why are you yelling at me? Don't get upset. Hey. Fish, where's Wing? I don't know, don't ask me. I know, Wing and Fan have gone shooting. They have to kiss. Hey. What does this paper mean? I taught this to Wing. To close his eyes and write down who is he thinking about. You only have a few strokes. Serve you right. What? Did I scare you? No. How would you describe me today? Very... What's with that? My mind is blank that I can't think of anything. I know. Are you nervous? Very. Here. -Which flavor do you like? -Condoms? Chewing gum. I hope when we're doing the kissing scene later, I'll taste better for you. You're late, Mr. Koo. I have to go to the toilet, you two should talk for a while. Wing! Hey. I have to talk to you. All right. You've become close to Wing recently, did you notice anything strange? Anything strange? No. He's nice to you. It doesn't look like a normal friendship. -I know. -It's not... I know what you mean. I was going to tell you after the film wraps. I think Wing is happier with me. Wing is happier with you? Then... He and you... Me and you... What is it? What's the matter? Calm down. Give Wing a chance, you can be with a woman again. Of course, I can! I... Anyway, both of you can't be together. Mr. Koo. Nothing is impossible. Face the reality. Face the reality? Good, you should face the reality. He's not my boyfriend. She's my girlfriend. She's my girlfriend. You have to find that feeling, can you do that? Help me find that feeling. It's a contradicting emotion. Fan Fan. Yes, that's the right emotion. Give me more feelings, all right? I know. Break a leg. Good, let's get ready. Shot 13, take 1. Scarlet. Rhett. Scarlet. Rhett. It doesn't matter if the world changes, even if we only have our sweet memories. We won't have any regrets. Don't worry, just a little bit more. Let's do it again. Take two. Take 8. Take 12. Director, let's take a break for lunch. Another break? Okay. Let's eat! -Okay! -All right! Fan Fan, I'm sorry. Am I being too nervous? I want to ask you something. If I were a man, would you still choose me over Sam? Forget it. I just want to tell you. That it was real. Director! Let's do it! Take 13. Scarlet. Rhett. It doesn't matter if the world changes, whether you're a man or a woman... even if we only have our sweet memories. We won't have any regrets. Who is it? Move! Auntie. Hey! I'm not answering your question, just like how you ignored Wing when she had problems. You don't make sense. She needs help right now, yet you walked out on her? The problem is she is now in love with a woman. Then tell her what to do. I don't know what to do. That excuse doesn't justify you walking out on her. Shit hits the fan, then you leave. You're such a coward. It's just the two of us, there's no need for a swimming suit. Hey. Look at me. Is that you? Christie? Christie. Not only is your ass fine. It's you who seduce me. I'm only taking your cue. That hurts! Please be gentle. You said that you'll never leave me. You said that you'll love me forever. You said that you would rather die. They were all lies. "But you're in love with Fan Fan." I wasn't! "You liar." She's good to me. "Sam is good to you too." If he really is good to me, he wouldn't have left. One last scene before the show is over. Faster! You pervert! You pervert. What is "concentrate"? Help! I have decided that I only like women. What's with that? I just... How could you say such a thing? No, silly. We were great! I give us a B+. B+? I had never gotten a B+ at school. That's right, but I think of you as a woman. I don't need a sex-change, right? No, silly! Even if you become a woman, I won't be stuck with you. There are plenty of other beautiful women. Can you be loyal to only one woman? No, I can't. It's a given. Some people can, while others can't. It's a no for both of us. But if I think that it's possible one day, I'll come back for you. When? When we're older. When we're older. Yes, when we're older. Whatever. How did I get a B+? How did you come up with a B+? A B+ means that it was almost perfect. Of course, you want to do better. Like a "Chi". Get a "Chu"... It's a feel. It's a feel. Yes. How to spell "feel"? You don't have the hiccups. What are you thinking about? I... What are you thinking about? I'm thinking... Hey. Hey, what's wrong? Don't cry. It's as if I forced myself on you. It was my first time too. -Just now, you didn't say no. -That's not it! I'm just thinking that... What is today's date? October 1st. It has only been four months! Yet I'm already a mess. Four months ago, I wore a white skirt and ran away from downtown to here. I thought I would be with Sam forever. But I can't believe that I had fallen in love with you! I understand. You don't understand. I know what you're thinking about. Do you? I don't even know myself. Give me your hand. Let me tell you this. -Say it after me. -All right. I, "I," Lam Chi-wing, "Lam Chi-wing," wish... "wish..." that it never happened and I'll live happily ever after with Sam. Remember this. This is it from now on. Fan Fan. How about we go out dancing? Let's put our clothes back on. Thank you. This is mine. -How ugly. -There's one. It's so big. Whose is it? It's mine. Is it yours? So big. When I pretended to be a woman... "Pretended to be a woman"? Aren't you actually one? -It's not that big. -Let me see! -Let me see. -Wing! Wing! It's Sam! Sam! Why would you hide when it's your home? It should be me. -Wing, where are you? -Handle it for me. -Just pretend that it's your home. -Hey! Wing. Don't be mad at me. I know I shouldn't have left like that. I would never do it again, okay? Also, you and I are meant to last forever. Even when you turn old. Even if you suffer from Parkinson's or cancer, I'll still be with you. Why are you here? I dozed off. -Why didn't you doze off at your place? -I was nearby! Where's Wing? -She left. -Where did she go? You should go out first, then I'll tell you. Go out? It's my room. -Don't think that night-- -Nothing happened! We slept together for one night, yet you said nothing happened? Let me tell you... You and my girl... You two are bastards! I hate both of you! -Wing... -Let me explain. Leave me alone! Say whatever you like. Wing. I don't want to hear any of it! As a matter of fact, what were you two doing? Hey! Take it easy. Treat each incident separately. Solve her problem first. Were you messing with my woman? Shut up! What are you saying? Was I that unreasonable? -Which page? -What? Look, there. That time, you didn't speak to me for three days. You were in a bad mood. But I'm always in a bad mood. But it's nothing personal. There were only the two of us in the house. How should I know it wasn't personal? We haven't talked like this for a long time. It's because you never talked to me. I didn't know how to talk to you, so how could we have talked? It's strange. People come to know more about each other after a break-up. Ka-ming. Don't be too rigid. You're giving a hard time to the ones close to you. Fish, I want to leave alone. Why? I want to fly there all by myself. You haven't taken any plane, aren't you afraid? Let me pay for my own ticket. Iâ€™m not a kid anymore, I really want to be alone. But I'm still a kid! What am I going to do without you? Don't you trust me? I can't even trust myself. It's Fan Fan. Fan Fan wants to give this to Wing. Wait up! What is it? Don't you have anything to say to me? No. How about you? No. I guess that's it. -Bye. -Bye. I'm sorry. Aside from the party that night, I never lied to you. That day, I held your hand and said, "I, Lam Chi-wing, wish that it never happened and I'll live happily ever after with Sam." You didn't seem to believe me. I didn't have the chance to talk to you. If you really love someone and you believe that he loves you, nothing can keep you from mending the broken pieces. Also, thank you for letting me know that little rabbit still exists. Ten years ago, I left Hong Kong in search of my little rabbit. Little did I realize, that I would one day find my innocence at the place where I first lost it. If I were to cross paths with you earlier, I wouldn't have to take all the wrong turns. -I'll miss it. -What will you miss? I don't know. Why do we travel by boat every time when we leave? You can see the scenery slowly fading out when you're on a boat. What kind of scenery? Wing! Wing! SAM, I LOVE YOU SECOND POINT OUTSTANDING LET'S GO TO AFRICA! SENSE OF SECURITY BORING Mr. Koo! -What is it? -The renovation is completed. I'll send the money to your office. It's not a matter of money. Mandy. -Say it. -You do it. Hurry up, I don't have much time. We always dance in front of you because we want to be noticed. -All right, I understand. -Get to the point. Actually, both you and Mr. Lam have always been our idols. But our relationship... However, ever since you both admitted it, we're filled with courage. To face this society. -To come out of the closet. -I understand. Even if Wing and I did not appear, you should not worry about how others look at you. It's because love can't be explained. -Thank you. -Thank you. Let's go. Right, the study room has been fully furnished. Due to Mr. Lam's request, you weren't allowed to go in until it's done. However, you can take a look at it now. -Okay. -Mandy, let's go. -Goodbye. -Bye. Are you leaving? Wing moved out, so why should I stay? Hey. Where did she go? I won't tell you. Hey. Go to the study to find out. That's it. Wing? Hey, it really is you. What a coincidence. Isn't it? Where's Sam? Should I change seat with him again? He's not coming. Don't cry. I don't know what to do. Leave me alone. Can you stop fidgeting? Economy class? Why are you going to Africa alone? Fish said that it's the furthest place from Hong Kong. You still hate me. Don't forgive me. It's such a mess and it's not only because of you. I don't even trust myself anymore. Sir? Are you all right? Yes, I'm just comforting my wife. Wife? He's a man. So? It's fine. Come on, let's go home. Africa is in our home. All right? Can we still go back? Why can't we? No matter what happened, it's still our home. What if after a few years, It doesn't work and we have to part again? That won't happen. What if it does? In case it does? If you don't give us a chance today, how would you know what will happen tomorrow? Promise me. Promise you what? Promise me to take the challenge... and marry me. -Sam. -Yes? Let's not go. All right, let's get off then. Sam, the plane is leaving. What should we do? -Let's take an early honeymoon. -What? Please fasten your seatbelt, sir. What should we do? Let's go for a holiday. What do you mean "holiday"? It's a 20-hour flight. -I won't make it. -You'll be fine. It's no different than being trapped in an elevator. -Of course it's different! -What? -It's not the same! -What should we do? -I'm scared. Look, it's shaky. -Just calm down! -I need oxygen. -Calm down! Pull it down to me! -Calm down! -Press the bell! -Come here! -Get a hold of yourself! Bitch, come back! Shit, I don't want to be on a plane.
