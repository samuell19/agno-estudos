'In Asia, situated in a corner of India.. ' '.. there is small village called Hadbahedi.' "Every grain of soil preaches.. " ".. that truth resides here." "Through the lanes of my land, oh, Mother.. " ".. the holiest of the yogis pass." Hadbahedi is as mystical and as ideal a village as Shangri-La. The people here are always happy. There's only one grievance. Outsiders consider our town to be a village. Having electricity is the first condition in being called a town. Look, we have electricity here. Right, Uncle? Yes, dear. Though we have electricity for just 8 out of 24 hours. But at least we have electricity. We just don't know when power comes. But Hadkam is trying. Someday, we will have electricity for all the 24 hours. Everything else is fine here. "A lamp flickers amidst a storm." - "A lamp flickers." "Somewhere the fire of hatred rages." - "The fire of hatred rages." "Somewhere there is a tempest of injustice." "Somewhere lies a dream, shattered." Why has it stopped, Uncle? - Just a moment, dear. Our machine has become very old, Fakirchand. I have heard Triphala has installed a new one. They are thieves. They sell tickets in black. They don't pay money to the distributors. Don't worry. Someday, we will have a Dolby system here. But Hadkam is trying. Everything else is fine here. Greetings. I am Arun Bakshi. I am the editor of Hadbahedi Times. Greetings, Arun. - Greetings, Ayesha. Our newspaper is a weekly one. But someday, it will be a daily. We'll have correspondents in every corner of India. People here like to read. And they pay to read. Look. "We have no worries." "God is kind to our land." "Everything here is fine." "Everything is fine." Trains from all directions arrive here. From the north, the south, the east and the west. But only one halts here. Makhanjeet Express. Someday even Shilajeet Express will halt here. But Hadkam is trying. Everything else is fine here. This is our airport. Not ours. Triphala's. Triphala is 5km away. And Hadbahedi is just 4km away. But we send the jaggery. That too twice in a week. Someday, we will own this airport. Just watch. But Hadkam is trying. "Everything here is fine." Hail Satyakam. Friends, you all know that our Prime Minister.. .. has announced Bharat Nirmal Yojana (welfare scheme). We have also found out that people of Triphala are plotting a ruse.. .. so that not we, but they reap the benefit of this program. The people of Triphala are heard by all. Because it's a famous city. Just because of two personalities. One. Raj Malaya. He has many big liquor factories. And second. Mr. Keshav Kanpatimaar. He has committed 13 murders. And he's preparing to contest the elections from jail. Because of these two people, Triphala has become famous. We don't mind it. And we don't want to be famous. We are content the way we are. Yes. I agree with you. But its Hadkam's true brother Arun's dream.. .. that people should know us. Yes. I want the whole world to know you all. Every person should have his own identity. How? For this, we will have to use the advertisement principle. Advertisement? Yes. Link your product with a famous personality. Your product will become famous. Like undergarments became famous because of Sunny Deol. Cold drinks because of Shah Rukh and Aamir. And God knows what all things have become famous.. .. because of Amitabh Bachchan. Like Jhansi because of Rani Laxmibai. Dandi because of Gandhi's journey on foot. And Pakistan's small village which became famous.. .. as it was the birthplace of our Prime Minister Mr. Manmohan Singh. Gah. - Wow. I wish a VIP had taken birth in our town. He has. He has. A VIP has taken birth here too. Who? Who? He's in my bag. VIP in your bag? Come. Come. - Come quickly. Come. Come. Tell me. Tell me. Who is it? Look. - Whose snap is this? This is me. This is Mr. Kapoor. - Okay. And she is his wife Krishna. - Who is in her arms? Her son. I was the midwife. - His name? I named him Chintu. Chintu. He is Raj Kapoor. - Raj Kapoor. Chintu Kapoor meaning Rishi Kapoor. Yes. He was born here. Rishi Kapoor. Look. Look. In 1952, both husband and wife.. .. came to offer flowers at Satyakam's grave. Incidentally, Krishna got labour pains. Coincidently, your uncle and I were there at that time. We quickly took them to the guest house. And there, Chintu was born. Friends, did you all hear? Today, I will write an invitation letter to Chintu.. .. to quickly come to his place of birth. Hail Satyakam. This is too small. Hey. What was that. What went in. It's biting me. He is the real actor. Help me out. What's this. It's biting me. Sir, it must be a wasp. Jaggery is delivered by this plane. And the wasp is returned. What insolence is this. - Sir, one minute. Sir, it flew away. What? That wasp? - Yes, sir. Stupid village and its lousy insects. Devika, I am really scared of mosquitoes and insects. I don't like it. I think.. Let's go back. Captain. - Sir. If you want to enter politics, if you want to become an MP.. .. then you will have to bear some discomforts. After all, this is your birthplace, sir. You are right. Now watch what I do. Heard the applause? Come on. I am Arun Bakshi. Hadkam's general secretary. She is our chairman. Kanta Mehta. Greetings, sir. This is our committee. Mr. Vashisht. - Greetings. Mr. Atam. - Greetings. Mr. Zaidi. - Greetings. Mr. Chaudhary. - Brother Chaudhary. Fakirchand. Our treasurer Radheshyam. Radheshyam. Wow. Wow. Radheshyam. Radheshyam. Oh, no. Wow. This is so romantic. I am Arun Bakshi. You? - Devika. Why did my parents have to come to this lousy place? Yes, sir. It is. Kutti. - Yes. Call up my home and say that I am returning tomorrow. Okay, sir. Relax, sir. Relax. Just remember one thing. P. - What P now? P for politics. And D for your dreams. And right now, just relax. Sorry, sir. No network. - Then clean this mess. Baby Chintu. My photo. What's going on? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Don't overdo it. Kutti. Enough. Kutti. Keep this. Sir. Sir. She is Shakuntala. She is the oldest midwife of this place. She was present at the time of your birth. And she had kept your name. I see. She is like a mother to you. Touch her feet. Come on. Come on. Please. Please. Come on. Sir. He is our mayor. And Kanta's husband. Shambunath Mehta. Welcome. Welcome home, Chintuji (Chintu). Welcome. What is this, Chintuji? I don't understand. My name is Rishi Kapoor. Call me Rishi Kapoor. But Chintuji sounds so sweet. It sounds so nice. Right? - Yes. Yes. Chintuji. - Hail. Chintuji. - Hail. Chintuji. - Hail. Come. Please come this way. Please. - Yes. Come. Come. Move. Move. Come. Please. Please. Sir, look. This symbolises how great you are for us. Yes. Yes. Yes. Sir, press the button. How high is Amitabh Bachchan's cut-out in U.P? - 25 feet. And what about Rajnikanth's in Chennai? - 30 feet. And this? - 35 feet, sir. Good. I like it. Sir, say a few words to your people. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen. Hindi. I don't understand what to say. If I had my way then I would have been born in England. Hollywood. But it was God's will. I was born here. Because he wanted your love. Yes. Yes. Chintuji, recite a dialogue from your film. Yes. Yes. - What dialogue should I recite? Please, Chintuji, dance. Dance? What's that? It's done on the screen. Not like this. VV. VV. - What VV? V for voters, sir. Please do it. Did you ever love somebody? Yes. Did you ever give your heart to somebody? Yes. Me too. Did you too? Oh, God. Are you a journalist or a romantic novelist? Both. Both. It's so hot here. It's so hot. Hey. Put this on the hanger. Don't you have an AC? Yes, sir. But there is no power. Because a lot of blackouts take place here. So, buy a generator. How do you people stay here? Sir, we are used to it now. I am not. Sir, try the okra. I read in a magazine that you love okra. I hate okra and I hate everyone.. .. who likes okra. Don't you have chicken? Sorry, sir. We don't eat non-vegetarian. And you don't serve it to guests too. Nonsense. Why are you kicking me? Sorry, sir. It happened by mistake. Why are you people standing? Please sit. Eat your food. Can I have a cold drink? Please. Yes, sir. Thank you. Even your cold drink is not cold. Sorry, sir. I have sent the guy to get ice. He will be here soon. Go find where Dinesh is. I hope my lodging arrangement is not made here? No, sir. You are staying at the guest house. I want to leave right now, Devika. Kutti. Let's leave now. Thank you, gentlemen. Here. Oh, God. I can't endure the pain. Oh, my God. Someone get me a drink. I want a bottle of whiskey at this time. Mariamma. - Yes, sir. Who was the one who dropped the ice? Call that idiot. I have given the painkiller. He will be fine. Mariamma? - Yes. I am Kutti. - Where are you from? I don't know Malayalam. I was born in Mumbai. My father was his father's secretary. And now I am his secretary. - I see. - Ok. Kutti. Don't worry. Chintuji is fine. Hail Satyakam. Now, you will have to keep Chintuji here for a few days. With Satyakam's grace very soon.. .. he will be able to move around in a wheelchair. But he won't feel comfortable here. Guest house has all the facilities. I know. I know, Shambunath. But he can suffer from spine injury, facture, anything. After two days, I will get his x-ray done. And I will find out. I have to call at Chintuji's house. Sorry. We don't have STD. But we will install it tomorrow. There is a booth at the crossing. - What? Booth. Booth. Telephone booth. I will show you. Come. Mariamma, look after the patient. No, no. You sit. Sit. Sit. No problem. I will find out on my own. Hang on. I too will come with you. Greetings. - Sit. Sit. You sit. - Come. Come. Sit. Sit. Will you have tea? - Surely. I will give it to her. I am the inspector of this place. Lehra Singh. Greetings. He is my colleague. Jaggi. - Greetings. How much for this? What? Bear one thing in mind, Devika. As long as you are in Hadbahedi.. .. don't open your purse at all. - Thank you. Wow. Delicious tea. Everything here is good, Devika. If you stay here for a few days.. .. you will feel as if you belong to this place. Like Arun. Is that so? You are not from this place? So, how come you are here? Since when? It's a long story. Here. Your town is great. You give free tea to customers. And police officers pay for it. This is God's and Satyakam's grace. You must not have observed. People don't lock their doors here.. .. because there are no robbers here. So, why are you people here? We? Just like that. Hang on, sir. I will just come. - Okay. Hello. Greetings. Everything is fine here. Did you hear? They just have to do this task. Dawn and dusk, they have to inform their seniors.. That everything is fine here. It's such a beautiful place, Kutti. And what's great is that police officers pay for things here. Yes. Chintuji's family members must be worried.. .. after hearing about his accident. Why to worry when I am there, madam? Neetu madam said, "Kutti, you handle everything." "We are going to Switzerland for two weeks." I said, "No problem. Go without any worry. I am there." Don't tell Chintuji about this Switzerland thing. Arun, here. Your flask of tea. Thank you. I will leave now. See you tomorrow. - Okay. Here. Check and mate. What fate? - Not fate, mate. Sir. My name is Gajendar Singh Chauhan. Last week, I was transferred from Delhi to Triphala. I heard that Rishi Kapoor has come here. - Yes. He slipped. He is badly injured. Oh. So sad. I am a big fan of his. No problem. I will come some other time. Sir, have some tea. No, no. Some other day. Some other day. Who was the guy who just left on a bike? I think I have seen him somewhere. He is our newspaper editor. Arun Bakshi. I see. I will leave. We have to be alert. For Arun. Yes. Yes. Is somebody there? Hello. Sir. - Who's singing my song so badly? Stop him. Nonsense. You want tea, sir? I will sleep for another hour. Bring tea later. And breakfast? - I will have eggs for breakfast. And listen. - Yes, sir. For lunch, arrange for country rooster. Country rooster. Egg? Chicken? It will spoil our religion, Kanta. Refuse him outright. All this is not allowed here. He is our guest, dear. And guest is akin to God. Guest is God. Did you forget? This too is our duty. Yes. But.. - That's it. Be strong. And listen, you go. Cook whatever food he wants. To atone for this, starting from today.. .. I will fast for three days. If you fast.. then I too will fast. I too will fast. - Me too. Hi. - Hi. Shall we? - Yes. In Karz (movie), Chintuji strummed the guitar so well. Fabulous. - Fabulous. Arun, listen. Arun. I will meet you later. I'm in a hurry. Seeing the city girl, he forgot his friends. He is gone. - Yes. So, where are you from? - Why? No. Vashisht was saying you are not from this place. Yes. I said it's a long story. Hear it some other day. Where are you from? And what's your relationship with Chintuji? It's a long story. Hear it some other day. Clich�. Jokes apart. I work in a PR agency. Chintuji has hired me. - I see. He wants to enter politics. He wants to be an MP. And I am writing his biography too. That's it. That's very good. And why not? When so many film stars have entered politics.. .. are writing their biography.. .. then why not Chintuji? Here, he will win unopposed. In fact, this could be his launching pad. Exactly. That's what I said when I read the invitation. I think with Satyakam's grace.. .. all dreams of Hadbahedi will come true. Who was Satyakam? A true saint. He established this town. Around 300 years ago. He had two disciples. Devpriya and Satyake. Devpriya was jealous of Satyake. Because he was dearer to the guru. Once Devpriya rebelled. And he went to another village from here. And he named it Triphala. Triphala became very rich. But through lies, deceit and dishonesty. But Hadbahedi never left Satyakam's path of.. .. truth, non-violence, love and honesty. The grave of both guru and disciple rests here. And it's a pilgrimage centre for us. Can we go there? - Yes. Definitely. But be prepared to come back. - What do you mean? I mean whoever goes there once.. .. always comes back. Once I went there with my parents when I was a kid. And my destiny brought me back. Greetings. - God bless you. Greetings. - Greetings. Greetings. - Greetings. Greetings. You people don't eat non-vegetarian. So, I have told my wife. She will cook it daily. And Ayesha will deliver it here. Thank you. Thank you, sir. What's in your hand? Ayesha and Dinesh are with me. Not with you, Father. In your hand. In my hand. Oh, my God. Telegram. - Oh. For Chintuji. From distant places. From England, America. - Is it? Wow. Our town is becoming world famous. No, no. This is a wrong number. Mehta doesn't stay here. Oh, my God. - Don't call again. Thank you. Here. Why is this AC not working whereas this useless fan is working? Fan and cordless phone are connected to the inverter. That's why they are working, sir. Now quickly switch on the AC.. .. otherwise I will smash your head with this flower vase. Did you hear? - What? What is he asking for? Egg? - Not eggs. AC. Indian eggs. All our hens are Indian. We don't like foreign brands. AC. As there is no power, the AC is not working. I see. AC. Why didn't you tell me before? I will do something. Switch it on. It's so hot. What's going on? Why is Chintuji yelling so much? Devika, there are many reasons. Which one do I tell you? Fine. I will check out. Sir. Sir. You have raised a commotion here. I couldn't even take a bath properly. Sit here and take a bath with sweat. Please change the cloth. You got unnerved by such a small thing. Look at other Ps. What all things they do for V. To hell with your P and V. I am fed up of this. Kutti. Yes, sir. Are you Kutti? - No, sir. Then why did you come? Shall I pick up the flower vase? No. - Kutti. Yes, sir. - Quickly charter the plane by which we came here. My family members must be so tense for me. They must be missing me so much. No, sir. They have gone to Swit.. What? - They have gone to Shirdi, sir. To pray for you. - Really? I will just inquire about the plane. Come, Mariamma. Beware. Thank God. Thank God. Thank God. Don't cry. Don't cry. How can I stop crying? Uncle, I have committed a sin. This is government electricity. I have given an illegal connection. But it's for a guest. And a guest is a messiah. Even I am the culprit, dear. You fast for three days. I too will fast. He'll forgive us. Here, Mr. Verma. All people of Hadbahedi have signed on this letter. You can cut electricity from our houses. But continue with Chintuji's supply. He is really in trouble. Look, I can understand his problem. But our transformer is very small for a supply of 24 hours. I will have to talk to my seniors. Do something, Mr. Verma. Hadbahedi's reputation is at stake. Even our department's reputation is at stake, Mr. Chaudhary. I will talk to my chief. Congratulations. Congratulations. My chief is Chintuji's fan. And he is ready to give a big transformer to Hadbahedi. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5 is there, sir. - 5 is here. Sir, here. - Here. Here. - Count from here. 5 is here. Sir. Kutti. - Sir. Who is right? - I think she is right, sir. Shut up. Who gives you salary? She or me? Oh, God. He cheats. Don't talk like that. Yes. Come in. Yes. Sir, Mr. Malkani's call from Mumbai. Malkani. Get the phone. Malkani. Of course. Of course. Sir. - Thank you. Thank you. Go. Come on, out. Malkani, how are you? My plight is really bad. I know, Chintuji. But don't worry. I am reaching there soon. Really? When? - As soon as possible. Get me out of here. I am lying on the bed. I am feeling choked. I will get you out. I am there. Okay. Bye. Hang on. Hang on. Bring my clothes from my home. And my other luggage too. Got it? Here, you don't get that stuff. Yes. I will collect it. Okay. I love you, darling. I love you too, Chintuji. Bye. Get lost. I love you too. Selfish fellow. Manish. Get two crates. From Ulhasnagar. Because of this man, because of this man, my film is stuck. And he is lying comfortably on the bed. Aman. Do one thing. Change the script. Chintuji should be lying on the bed. Death scene. Finish him off. What are you saying? Mr. Malkani, I am in this film industry for the past 40 years. I have written 17 hit films. I have won three Filmfare and two National awards. And you are telling me to ruin the script. You settle Aman's account. And Manish, you call Mr. Bhatt. He will change any scene into a death scene in two minutes. Yes, sir. Look, I have no objection with the death scene. But if we add action or suspense.. .. then the scene will be a hit. Tell me. Shall I add it? Add anything. Everything will do. My film's budget has exceeded the limit. And the release date is fast approaching. And this man has chosen such an accident location.. .. which is in some Godforsaken place. Yes. I found it. Look. Yes. It's there. Quickly find out which flights go there. Sir, there is only one flight. It goes there twice a week. But it won't be able to fly for the next 10-12 days. Because their plane is not functioning properly. Train? Sir, there is one passenger train. - Okay. It takes 46 hours. Provided the train is on time. Fine. Book my ticket for today. And after two days, book the entire unit's ticket. Sir, we are like family. But junior artists won't be ready to travel by passenger train. Their association is very strong. Menaka too won't give her consent. She has too much attitude. So? What can be done? Sir, there is one solution. What? Tell me. Tell me. What. Who is that superman? Find him. There is he, sir. Shall I call him? Yes. No. It's fine. It's fine. My assistant was telling me that you can stop any train anywhere. Yes, sir. Provided you give me a role in your film. Sir, I have received training. To stop train? No, sir. In acting. Look. My portfolio. To hell with the portfolio. You tell me. How can you stop any train anywhere? Sir, by telling my brother-in-law. He is the railway minister, sir. Railway minister? - Yes, sir. What's your name? - Paplu Yadhav. You are such a talented man. Where were you till now? I was here, sir. Sir, I have been trying to meet you since the past two years. No problem. No problem. I am so sorry, dear. But it's never too late. Aman, find a nice subject for him. I have one. A great subject. With two heroes. Train to Afghanistan. Shall I narrate it? No. You do one thing. For the moment, concentrate on the scene.. .. which we have to shoot there. Hadbadi. Hadbadi. What's the name of the place? Hadbahedi. Weekly Hadbahedi Times. - Yes, sir. What's its circulation? - Sir, enough. Besides Triphala, it's read in some 65 villages and small islands. Do you use good quality paper? How will you print my photo in this? What do you say? You should use.. glossy. Pardon me, sir. I know what kind of useless things.. .. are printed in glossy newspapers. As it is, sir, paper's quality is assessed.. .. by the matter printed in it. I'm sorry, I won't give an interview in this. This is all rubbish. Well done, Chintuji. Well done. What happened? This is not a newspaper. It's your vote. You are throwing it away. Shave my beard. Arun. Arun. Stop, Arun. Listen. Arun. A cup of tea please. - In a moment, sir. I think you are coming from a distant place. From Delhi. Are you a journalist? Not of a useless newspaper like this. But of a famous newspaper. I have come to cover all of Rishi Kapoor's news. Where did he break his leg? No, he didn't break his leg. But he needs rest. It's a small injury. - Sir, tea. Will I get a cheap place to stay? Yes. Public inn. You can stay for free for three days. And later, pay Rs.5 daily. Is that so? So cheap? Where is the inn? - Inn? Bar. Here, you won't get any intoxicant. Besides this tea. Is that so? Where will I get it? - Triphala. Are you from another city? - Yes. Delhi. What are you doing here in Triphala? I had come to Hadbahedi. To interview Rishi Kapoor. But you don't get liquor there. So, I came here. I see. You are a journalist. - Yes. Then you are useful to me. Pratap, get chicken for sir. - Yes, sir. Vidyasagar. - Chauhan. One for you. And one for your guest. Will you do me a favour, Vidyasagar? Not just one. I will do five. There is a man in Hadbahedi. I want all information about him. You will get it. But what will I get? A lot. Start the work first. Fine. Who is he? Arun. Come on. Come on. Arun. Arun. What happened? Are you badly hurt? He is badly hurt. Come. - Let's go. Come - No. - Sit down. - I don't want to sit. I am fine. You have hurt your head. - Brother, water. Have some water. Oh, my God. I am so sorry. You got hurt because of me. No, it's okay. It's a small injury. I came here to apologize. For Chintuji's misbehaviour. Don't take that man's name. He is a pain in the neck. Mind your tongue. Chintuji is our guest. Apologise. Yes. Apologise. Okay. Okay. I am sorry, Devika. Actually, he is from another town. He has still not become a Hadbahedi native yet. Chintuji, listen. Very confidential. What? I've a long time dream that I should become a film writer. Film writer? - Yes. I became a doctor because of my parents. I have already written one. Wait a minute. Let me check. What a coincidence. The script is in my bag. Is this the script? Or the telephone directory? It is my 30 years of hard work. It has everything. Action. Emotion. Drama. Physical intimacy? - I'll add it. Will you listen to it? I'll have to create the mood to read a film script. How? It is done.. with some alcohol. Oh, God. What am I listening to? No. You don't get liquor in Hadbahedi. It is impossible. All right. Then you'll have to wait longer. Tomorrow, I'll try to meet Rishi Kapoor for an interview. And yes, tomorrow, I'll email some photos from Triphala. For the next sessions. I'll also send a photograph of a man. You get it checked with other newspapers. I think there is something wrong. I've seen him somewhere. Okay? Okay, bye. I heard each word of Vidyasagar's. He was talking in a low voice. He was sending Arun's photograph from Triphala. This man is very dangerous. Yes. If Arun's secret is out then Hadbahedi's progress will stop. Don't worry at all. I've a very good cure for it. What? I'll tell you. But everybody will have to repent for it. Three days of fast without water. Oh, it's that type of work? - Yes. All right. Tell us. Look there. Look there. What a thing. What is it? You look so funny. Oh, I wasn't prepared. Tea? - Thank you. What are you looking at? Why do you wear a sad look all the time? No. Nothing of that sort. Come on. Tell me your story. Under the pretext of tea. "Let's call out to life once again." "Let's spend some moments together." "Under the pretext of tea." "Under the pretext of tea." "Under the pretext of tea." "Under the pretext of tea." "Where have those sweet talks disappeared?" "Lovely days, lovely nights." "All those old topics." "All those lovely joyous moments." "The childhood at the banks of a river." "The serene moments spent together." "Under the pretext of tea." "Under the pretext of tea." "Under the pretext of tea." "Under the pretext of tea." "Consider me your own." "Call me close to you." "Let's spend some moments together." "Consider me as yours." "Call me close to you." "Let's spend some moments together." "These clouds and the rains." "The waves of the river." "All are pointing towards us." "Come, let's cherish these moments." "Let's spend some moments together." "Under the pretext of tea." "Under the pretext of tea." "Under the pretext of tea." "Under the pretext of tea." Chintuji, I brought a bottle for you with a lot of difficulty. Oh, God. - You we going to lose your 30 years of hard work. Yes. My assistant brought it from the next village. Okay. Okay. There is some form of alcohol in allopathic medicine. So, I'm giving you this alcohol as medicine. What's this? Put some more. Give me a double dose. So small a peg. - Ok. Here. Cheers. Oh. It has a horrible stench. Whatever it is. Something is better than nothing. That's very true. Cheers. So, now, I'll begin. Okay? Chintuji. Please. Our film starts at Shantiniketan. A big tree. What? - Tree. Below it.. Mr. Khokon. - Mr. Khokon? I mean my hero. He is sitting. And Labonya is sitting in front of him. Labonya? - The heroine. - Yes. Now, they sing a song together. Very sweet song. "There was desire. There was love." Now, Labonya sings.. "There was desire. There was love." What's that band for? My friend's daughter's marriage. - Yes. I didn't go. I sacrificed for you. Wonderful. The song, okay? "There was desire. There was love." "There was desire. There was love." Hey, stop the band. Please. Stop the band. Chintuji is getting disturbed. Hey, Brother, stop the band. Stop it. Khokon, I want to live. Khokon. I'm going away. I'm going away. Labonya. You marry someone else. I'm going away. No. This cannot happen, cannot happen at all. Khokon. Khokon. The gift of our love. What will happen to our child? Father. - O dear! Khokon, this cannot happen. Our Shantiniketan. Our songs under the tree. What will happen to all that? Khokon. Khokon. Stop your tragedy now. Please. Chintuji. - He's here? He's here. Yes, it is very tragic. Very tragic. We pushed it for so long. How much further? When will it start? Push it. Sister. - Yes. Just sniff it. 72 hours, 45 minutes 31 seconds. But finally, we reached. How much? No. Sir, how can I take money from you? Why? You are Chintuji's guest. Hence, our guest too. Brother, what's your name? Antoine. Antoine Pandey. Antoine was a famous film director from Italy. Yes. Once he came to India. My father drove him around on his rickshaw. After that, I have you as my passenger. Wow. After Antoine, the next director is Mr. Malkani. Brother, I'd surely thank you in the credit list of my film. Because this is my film's biggest saving. And this is also the biggest honour. Thank you. Come on, Manish. Come. It seems the good days have dawned on us. Only that Chintuji shouldn't find out that the whiskey is a fake. Come on. I've given it to many of them. After drinking the fakes.. .. I've forgotten the taste of real ones. Yes. - Mr. Malkani. - Yes. Now, my back is somewhat better. I can travel now. Now, take me away from here. No, Chintuji, not at all now. Why? - I've to complete my film. So, are you here for shooting the film? Yes, the unit will come within two days. You never told me. But I've just one problem. - What? I don't have extras. That's no problem. I'll arrange for you. So, how much will I have to pay for it? Everything is free. My boss has mesmerised everybody here. Oh, free? - Like the rickshaw driver. Then order double extras. But the savings that you have here.. 50 percent will go to Chintuji. Who else. I'll leave now, Chintuji. I've to find a location. - Okay. Let's find a free stay soon. Or it will be night. Dr. Ghoshal. Dr. Ghoshal, he is our director Dr. Malkani. Mr. Malkani, he is writer Ghoshal. He has written a great script. You must listen to it. Sure. Sure. One can chance upon diamonds amidst glass, like our Paplu Yadhav. I'll meet you later sir, okay? Bye. - Ok, goodnight. Ok, bye. Come on. Brother. Brother. Good news. Good news. Is this good news for you? You'll sit on a wheelchair tomorrow morning. You can steer this wheelchair so well? Sir, you steered it so well in the film Chandni. Good morning, sir. Sir, you look so well in this chair. Beautiful, sir. Wait a minute. Yes, sir. - Where are you going? To my office. Where are you going from? From this door, sir. No. As long as I'm in this house, you can't use this door. Nor can you use your car. What are you saying, sir? Mr. Sinha will tell you the rest. Mr. Sinha? My advocate. I'm filing Rs.5 crore lawsuit on you. Compensation for the loss I suffered in your home. You are too much. What have I done? Who had dropped the ice? That's it. Careful. - Careful. Listen. Thank you. Good news. Good news. Good news for all of you. Our Hello company is going to build a mobile networking tower. No, sir. We don't want mobile phones. You are strange. Nowadays, every small village has mobile phones. But you are refusing it? We'll give you the handsets very cheap. For only Rs.250. Mister, we've already told you. We don't want the mobile phones. Why don't you want? Our Chintuji has become immobile without a mobile. So, Hello has arrived here. And you are sending them away. Please allow them. All right. You can install it. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. Come on, boys, let's look for a place for our showroom. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Look, don't be angry. This is Chintuji's problem. Please co-operate with us. Do the boys here have an allergy to mobile phones? Yes. There is a secret to it. Secret? - Yes. Come with me. I'll tell you. I'm very interested in secrets. Sting operation. Let's go. Please. The place for relieving stools and piddles. I know Hindi well. But I don't understand these words. What does it mean? Number one and number two. Come. You look very happy? I think I'm in love. Oh. But you are very young. While I'm already married man. I know that very well, sir. But I'm not in love with you. When did I say so? I was just trying to say that I'm a mature and sensible person. I can give you the right advice. Thank you so much, sir. I'll ask for it when I need it. For now, I'm going for an outing. My job is over. No. Your job is not over. You've to complete my book. Sir, please, sir. Sit. Please. So where were we? When you worked for 'Mera Naam Joker' for the first time.. Yes. I was 15 to 16 years old. I remember when Mr. Raj Kapoor asked my mummy for permission.. .. whether I can work for the Joker's part.. Because I was studying. I was so excited that I ran to my room.. .. and I began practising my autograph. Sir. There is a phone call from a Delhi newspaper. That one of their reporter is missing. Vidyasagar. They said that he was staying here. Yes, in this asylum. But he left from here last evening. Yes. Where? Sir, we don't know about it. We are very sorry, Mr. Vidyasagar.. .. that we have kidnapped you. And we have tied you in this manner. We apologise to you. You must be very hungry? Please have some snacks. Please. Open your mouth, please. Open your mouth. Moon from far away.. Prepares dishes for you. You eat in the plate. And serve the kid in the cup. Come, let's go to the guesthouse. Host, the ritual is complete. Welcome. Welcome. A very hearty welcome to you. - Welcome. Welcome. All of you from the Mumbai film world are welcome to Hadbahedi. I'm very happy to tell you that since Chintuji came here.. .. Hadbahedi is making great progress. Earlier, there was power supply only for eight hours here. But because of Chintuji, the electricity department.. .. has provided six extra hours of power supply. And they have promised to give us power supply for 24 hours very soon. Due to Chintuji, there will be a film shooting here for the first time. And just as because of Mr. Yash Chopra Switzerland.. .. is famous all over India, we hope that one day.. .. Hadbahedi too will be famous all over India. The item here is very good. People like you malign the name of the film industry. Our town is very small. For a hotel, we have a small asylum and government.. .. bungalow where everybody cannot be accommodated. But there is enough place for all of you in our hearts. So, for some of you, accommodation.. .. has been made available in our houses. Hail. - Mr. Satyakam. The instalment for your Khandala bungalow is due. We've received a bank notice. If you do not pay Rs.20 lakh within 15 days.. .. then the bank will seize the property. Income tax returns are to be filed. Please do something soon. Yes, okay. Good morning, sir. Sir, my name is Gyan. So? What can I do? Sir, some of us friends are beginning a TV channel service here. Sir, we wish that you should inaugurate it tomorrow. Rs.30 lakh. Sir? Rs.30 lakh to cut the ribbon. Why are you staring at me? Nowadays, actors get money to attend marriages too. Nobody even attends a funeral service for free. By the way, what is your budget? He is Amar Sanghavi from Triphala. Mr. Kapoor, my name is Amar Sanghavi. I'm the political adviser to honourable Raj Malaya. Who doesn't know you, Mr. Amar Sanghavi? - Yes. In our society you are so.. You know what I mean? - Yes, I do. Honourable Mr. Raj Malaya has sent.. .. this whiskey especially for you. Please accept it. - Wow. Thank you. Thank you. There's no label on it. It's not named yet. He wants to name it. Chintu no. 1. You must be joking, right? No, Mr. Kapoor, I'm very serious. By the way, call me Chintu. Chintu no. 1. Good stuff. Mr. Chintu, every year, you'll get Rs.50 lakh as fee. And free whiskey as much as you want. Well, this is interesting. What else? And agricultural land anywhere you want in Triphala. But I was born at Hadbahedi. The district here is Triphala. We'll take care of the registration office. And we'll prove that you were not born here but at Triphala. So, tell me, Mr. Kapoor. Do you agree? I've two conditions. If you accept, I'd agree. Please order me. The first condition is about money. You make Rs.50 lakh into a round figure. Rs.1 crore. Rs.50 lakh is already a round figure, sir. I know, but 1 crore is even more rounder. Okay. Okay. Second condition. My nomination for the Rajya Sabha (Upper house). All right. This will be done too. But I'll have to talk to honourable Mr. Raj Malaya. Mr. Chintu, give me two-three days. Meanwhile, keep the people here entertained. No problem. Don't worry, Mr. Mohan. Our problems are over. I'll pay the bank instalment, tax liability within three-four days. Promise. Okay. Wow. Look at her. She is looking great. You asked money to inaugurate Gyan's shop? Yes. Any problem with it? There's definitely a problem, sir. As your P.R.O., I'm sorry, I cannot allow this. Only the people over here can fulfil your political dream. But you are asking money from them? My dear, it is not a part of your duty.. .. to interfere in my personal life. Anyway, I was somewhat upset yesterday. I must have said something objectionable. But I didn't really mean it. And Mr. Amar Sanghavi from Triphala.. Why had he come here? You are forgetting, Devika, sometime back, I was a big star. I had thousands of fans. Amar Sanghavi is one of them. So, he came to meet me. He is a political broker. He is Raj Malaya's special man. I know. Mr. Malaya has sent this whiskey box too. He invited me for dinner too. But I refused point blank. Are you telling the truth? Listen to her. Can I ever lie? I'd want my heart to die if I lie. Then please come with me. And assure the people of Hadbahedi who're waiting outside. They are waiting outside? - Yes, please come. You go ahead. I'll freshen up and come. Give me two-three days. Meanwhile, keep the people here entertained. Friends, believe me. I've refused Raj Malaya's invitation. I said very clearly that Hadbahedi is my own. And I belong to Hadbahedi. I'll bring my plant here. That was the whole issue. It seems you don't believe what I said. You don't believe me? Forget it. What back pain? The biggest pain is that you don't.. Mother. Mother, please come. Look at her. Who is she? She is my mother. Today, I swear on this mother's head.. .. that I've nothing to do with the people of Triphala. I got nothing to do with them. If I unknowingly have committed any mistake, then please forgive me. I apologise to Arun too. And Gyan, my brother.. please forgive me. I made a mistake. I'll inaugurate your shop right now. And I'll do it for free. Is that fine with you? - Sir! Hug me, my friend. Okay, let me inaugurate it. Okay? Good luck. Good luck. Applause. Long live. - Chintuji. Long live. - Chintuji. My friend, Jack, is coming to India for the first time. For the shooting of this film. Please welcome him wholeheartedly. Hi. Please come. Welcome. Welcome my friend, Jack. Welcome to India. How are you? I'm fine. Thank you. Your Hindi was not bad and my French wasn't bad either. How was your journey? I'm thrilled. But I couldn't see things because I was in that.. .. very unique vehicle, what do you call it? Palanquin. I wanted to see some unique features of your country. Unique? -Yes. Well, I'll show you tomorrow morning. The most unique thing of India. It is very, very unique way of doing potty.. On my haunches. It is called yoga, right? Wow. I'm enjoying this. Open sky. Riverside. Fresh air. The birds flying. And such sweet chirping. It's divine. And so, the people in the west call India their Guru. I'll try back home. Thank you. Thank you very much. You are most welcome, Jack. Please come, sir. This way? - Yes, this way. Look at this place. There are many good locations at Hadbahedi. This is one of them if you like. Yes. Yes. - Ahead, over there.. No. No. The camera will be here. Shooting will be done here. Malkani, you'll put the set here? Set? Sir, please come here. - Just a second, sir. What happened? - Just a second, sir. What are you saying, sir? I don't have money. Not enough budget. So, you are compromising? This is the most important song of the film. This is the great dramatic moment. So, I'm bringing eight foreign dancers. And I've also included Ms. Menaka in the song. Menaka? - Yes. Menaka? - Yes. Great. That's good. Sir, I do so much for you. But if you too can do something for the set.. Oh. Oh. Ms. Kanta, I've a request. Yes, sir. - If Mr. Malkani wants to put a set here, then you.. Just order us, sir. Enough. Enough. My job is done. Thank you, sir. What are you doing? There's a surprise for you. What is the surprise? I'll show you. Hold on. Hold on. Come here. See. Wow. Hadbahedi Times in colour? And it's a daily? Wow. This is incredible. I'm so happy. Congratulations. Thank you. Devika, I owe this to you. Not to me, but to Chintuji. Yes, I agree. Because of Chintuji, the circulation.. .. of our newspaper has doubled. Hadbahedi has become well known everywhere. But you are my real media. All my dreams have come true because of you. All? No, one is left. Your letter. There is a registered letter for you from Delhi. At the address of the asylum. Your signature is needed. I'll do it with my feet. You have tied my hands. Oh. Please forgive me. I'll open it right away. It is a government affair. And government affairs should be done properly. And your signature is needed for this. Here. Take this. Where do I keep it? Bend down. Please enter the date too. Date? - Yes. Okay. Take this. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. It seems it will rain the whole night. Come on. Tell me your detailed story. Why do you want to hear it? In a few days, you'll go back from here. Please come along with me. You are talented. There are so many opportunities there. I agree that Hadbahedi is a beautiful place. But you know, you can always come back for your holidays. You won't understand, Devika. Everything I own is here. This is where I need to be. You'll go back from here. And you'll forget this place. But this is my destiny. And I'm here to stay. My long story hasn't come to an end as yet. You wanted to hear it, right? You'll be shocked to hear it. But still, I'll tell you. My story begins a few years back. Year 2001, 13th of December. The day there was an attack on the parliament. Don't you remember? Devika? This is good. It sounds nice. Mr. Basu. - Yes. One thing is good. Our set is ready, almost as Mr. Malkani had wanted it. Isn't it? - Yes. There is one more special thing. Chintuji has ordered that all of you will have to act in the film. It means so many revolutionary changes have.. .. occurred in our Hadbahedi because of Chintuji? Yes. - That's right. - So much work is being done? - Right. If everybody thinks in this manner about his birthplace.. .. and things get done in this manner then our youth.. .. won't feel the need to go to cities. Yes. Mr. Malkani, what is my motivation? An actor has only one motivation. Money. Money. So, should I say that money.. No, you say, "Hidimba, I'm boiling." Yes. - Sir, watch the rehearsal. - All right. Silence. Mr. Malkani, my shot.. Ms. Menaka, just two minutes. Serve refreshments to Ms. Menaka, please. Remove the umbrella. Say action. Action. Action. Zingala. Zingala. Bambola. Bambola. Zingala. Zingala. Bambola. Bambola. Zingala. Zingala. Cut. Cut. -Bambola.. We'll have a retake. Will my father go give the clap there? Sir, it was not a take. It was a rehearsal, sir. So, won't there be a rehearsal of the clap? Yes. - Come on. Go. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm getting a bit confused. When I was narrated the script, I was riding on a horse. Now, why have you put me on bed? Ask the director about it. He ordered it. I placed it. Chintuji, you were sick, so, I didn't want to trouble you. So, I've put you on the bed. But I'm fine now. I can ride a horse too. Get me down. You explain the whole scene to me. And motivate me as an actor. An actor has only one motivation. What? - I'll tell you that. What are you looking at? Bring the horse. Come on. Come on. Sir, the horse is here. What? Is this a horse? Yes, sir. - Move. But it is a mule. I could find only this in Hadbahedi. Doesn't matter. Chintuji, you look so good on the mule. What are you saying? - Come here when I say action. All right. Action. Chintuji, please come. This mule is not walking at all. Then whip it. - No, no. Ms. Menaka will get upset. Why would I get upset? I am not talking about you. I am talking about that Menaka. Animal welfare activist. Okay, okay. Let me think. Let me think. But, sir.. - Let me think. Action. How was it? Good? - Very good. Action. Hidimba. I am burning. Mobutu. Mobutu. Mobutu. Cut. - Cut. Very good. - Very bad. Why? Ms. Menaka said the dialogue all wrong. Take another take. I said what you have written. No, madam, you said it wrong. What was your line? Wrong. Your line is.. What is the difference between the two of them? There is a lot of difference. A huge difference. You will have to say the right line. No. I have already said what I had to. I won't say it again. And anyway, all your lines are nonsensical. You dare to challenge me. You have just entered the industry. I have been in the industry for the past 40 years. I have given 17 hit films. I have won three Filmfares and two National awards. And you will teach me how to write. Mr. Malkani.. - Whether Mr. Malkani sir calls Mr. Sampat.. .. or calls Mr. Bhatt.. This time around, I won't budge. My association is behind me. You will have to say the right line. I won't say it. I won't say it. I will absolutely not. Just a minute. Just a minute. Both of you have forgotten that.. .. I am the producerdirector of this film. Me. - If you really are, then prove it. And ask her to say the proper line. What if I give this dialogue to Paplu Yadhav? You can't do that. Why can't I? I am the producerdirector of this film. My association is behind me too. Who will stop me? - I will stop you. Because a man can't say this line. Why can't he? Because it means I am pregnant. Menaka, I am a heart patient. Just say this one line properly.. .. I will pay you Rs.50,000 extra. Cash. Will you start from the beginning? No, just this one line.. in close up. Okay, ready. - Thank you. Roll sound, camera, action. Cut. Song. Song. Satyajit Ray. Paplu has found a girl for himself. Find me a girl too. Paplu is very serious. What rubbish? You fool, I travelled six miles to get alcohol. Where can I get you a girl from? There she comes. "Sometimes.. " What are you doing? Come on. Leave me. Leave her. Hey, what are you doing! If not the girl, her drape will do. That's the limit. These people committed theft in your homes. Misbehaved with Ayesha. And all of you are quiet. We already told you that we don't need fame. We are happy the way we are. Arun, development has some negative points too. And it always comes along. I wanted the world to know the speciality of Hadbahedi. Anyway, I suggest that we search their luggage.. .. so that we can recover the stolen goods. And I would like to thrash the boy who misbehaved with Ayesha. Listen, Arun, they are leaving tomorrow, let them leave. No, you don't understand.. - Arun. No. The house in which I was staying, everyone is crazy. Look. You took it? Of course. Who can leave money? Look, I brought this. Hey, you! - You are all very lucky. All I could get my hands on was this. Homemade food for your journey. Our best wishes are with you. Here. Eat slowly, the chicken will not run away. That old man ruined my digestion.. .. by treating me to herbs and fruits. I escaped because of this letter. My suspicion was correct. His real name is Manjeet Singh. The police is looking for him for.. .. the terrorist attack on the Parliament. But what will you do now? Just watch what I do? Hello. Yes. Okay, sir. Yes. Thank you, sir. Thank you. There was a call from the Prime Minister's office. Prime Minister. - Yes. Our minister of external affairs, Mr, Sanjeev Oberoi.. .. and the foreign council of Uzbekistan are coming here. They have some urgent work with Chintuji. Good morning, Mr. Kapoor. This is my counterpart. Mr. Nicolagovor! Foreign council of Uzbekistan. He is saying there is a woman very ill in Tashkent. And she wants to come here. This woman is the wife of Uzbekistan's vice president. And, she is in the last stage of cancer. Yes, but how is this matter connected to me? Let me explain. Officially and personally, her husband.. .. has requested our Prime Minister. To aide in fulfilling Lady Sana's last wish. There is a protocol between Uzbekistan.. .. and the government of India. That's why, the Indian government.. .. wants to make every effort possible. Before marriage, Marina was an actress. Years ago, she acted with your father Raj Kapoor in a film. And its name was 'Mera Naam Joker'. During her tour of India, she had come here once. Now, during the last days of her life.. .. she wants to come here again. She is praying. Mr. Kapoor, she is calling you. Oh, my God. Hello, Sana, I am Rishi Kapoor. Welcome to India. - Thank you. You look like your father. - Really? It's true. Dada? - Yes, yes. This is for you. For me? - Yes. Meeting, separation. Separation, meeting.. that's life. I came here 40 years ago. I always dreamed to be Shirwas again. Your father was a very nice actor. But he was an even better human being. You too should be like him. Hello, Manjeet. What happened? My name is Arun Bakshi, not Manjeet. I knew you'd say that. That's why I have brought along the evidence. What do you want? Rs.20 lakh which the terrorist association.. .. gave you to distribute among your allies. I don't have any money. I don't care. If you want to live here peacefully.. .. then I want that money. I will come again tomorrow. Keep the money ready. So, this is your reality. Devika, this is not true. - Liar. Liar. Devika. - I hate you, Arun. I hate you. Don't cry. Stop crying. Don't cry. Arun is not a liar, Devika. He has been misunderstood as a terrorist.. .. just because of a SIM card. And the person who Arun had lent his SIM card to, Ansari.. .. he was innocent too. And the poor boy is still rotting in jail. All of us know that. That's why we have hid him here. But how do you know Arun is innocent? Arun has told us all this himself. And we believe in our hearts that he is innocent. And anyway, we people of Hadbahedi listen to our hearts. What should I do? Please connect me to Mr. Joshi, the chief editor. Hello, sir, this is Devika Malhotra speaking. Yes, sir. Sir, can you mail me all the information.. .. related to the Parliament attack, Ansari case? Thank you so much, sir. I will be grateful. Mr. Amar Sanghavi sir, how are you? I am very well, sir. Thank you. I read the contract. I will sign it in front of you. And sir, my small cheque.. Thank you, sir. Sir, I had a small request. Don't deduct the TDS. Thank you, sir. Yes, we will leave after a while. Any problem? Okay, sir. Excuse me, sir. Yes, Devika. What conspiracy are you hatching with Amar Sanghavi? That's none of your business. It is my business. You are a liar, Mr. Rishi Kapoor. I am quitting. And I am going to report this to my agency. Damn your agency. I don't need you people. And, as far as my political career is concerned.. I have made my own arrangements. So, go to hell. - You go to hell. Here, I have given my initials. And here is Mr. Rishi Kapoor. Yes, sir. Here Chintuji.. your round figure cheque. - 1 crore. Thank you. - Thank you. All the best. I shall take your leave. Enjoy the party. What's the hurry? There is no trusting actors.. .. they always keep changing their roles. Mr. Amar Sanghavi, you people change parties.. .. more often than we do. Manjeet. Manjeet Singh. Manjeet, I have arrived. For the money. What happened, Brother? We collected as much as we could. There's some money and my wife's silver jewellery. Please take it. Chauhan has arrived. I have already told you, I don't have any money. There was a message on Ansari's mobile.. Have received the money, leaving Delhi. I didn't get the money from Ansari, so, where is it? I don't know where it is. Mr. Chauhan. Please spare Arun. He doesn't lie, Mr. Chauhan. He never had any money and he still doesn't. You want money, don't you? We, the people of Hadbahedi, have collected some money. Take this and spare our Arun. Don't act smart, Manjeet. Give me the bag. - No, I can't let this happen. Arun, give him the bag. Give him the bag, Arun. Give him the bag. You arrest me, take me to Delhi. I am ready to rot in jail all my life. But I won't give this bag to you. Manjeet, give me that bag. Give him the bag. Manjeet, give me that bag. - I won't. Arun. Arun. Get up. Get up. Are you fine? Give me the bag. - No. Don't be insane, leave it. Here is the money, go away. Wait. Don't you dare touch that bag. Both of you are such idiots. The supreme court has acquitted Ansari three months ago. That's why, Arun's case was dismissed. And you are still blackmailing him. Look, here is the evidence. Arun is innocent. Arun, are you fine? I am sorry, Arun. I misunderstood you. Shall we go to Triphala? You know, I want to show you something.. .. very unique about us Indians. Come along, Mr. Amar Sanghavi. I want to show this man, how Indians.. .. worship people like us. Come. Hey, you, get whiskey into the car. We shall talk in the car. Come on. Stop the car. Stop the car here. Here we are. Come on, Jack. Come, Jack. This is me. This is how Indian people worship their actors.. .. politicians, sportspersons. This is how Indian people.. .. want to show their love for their idols. This is a 35-feet me. Cheers to me. My.. my. So huge. I am standing tall at 35 feet, Mr. Amar. But do they live up to their image? Sorry, I couldn't hear you. Say again. I said, do they.. or, do you live up to that image. He is asking, whether you politicians, actors.. .. and sportspersons are really that great? Sir. I haven't seen anyone as cheap and lowly as you. Since you came here, our town has been cursed. You brought every vice of your world along. Look at them. They gave you everything. Love, respect. They worshipped you. Everybody worked for free in your film. For your meat and alcohol.. .. they broke their religious traditions. They sent off thieves with love and kindness. And what did you do for them? Deceit. Betrayal. You called her your mother. And took a false oath on her. We love her more than our lives. Hello. Mr. Kapoor. - Yes. There is sad news for you. We have just been informed, that Lady Marina.. .. just passed away in Tashkent. Thank you. 'You father was a very nice actor.' 'But he was an even better human being.' 'Be like him.' Forgive me, Chintuji. I am incomplete now. Forgive me, as you would your younger brother. Chintu. Forgive us. Arun is still young. He has made a mistake. We don't have any grievances against you. If you want to go to Triphala, then we will escort you till the border. No matter where you are, you will always dwell in our hearts. And we will always love you the same. Shall I show you something? Come. Pull. Pull. Harder. Pull. Pull. Pick it up. Rishi K, these people are great. They have raised you again. And this way, the dreams of Hadbahedi were fulfilled. And their city got famous. Now, even Shilajeet express stops at Hadbahedi station. Chintuji and Malkani together.. .. upgraded Hadbahedi cinema hall with Dolby system. Hadbahedi got an airport. People from all over the world.. .. started visiting Satyakam's tomb. Chintuji gave up the thought of entering politics. Devika left her PR job and joined Arun's newspaper. And both settled down. Kutti and Mariamma got married too. The elders of Hadbahedi still sit at the same tea stall.. .. play chess and gossip. "Every grain of soil preaches.. " ".. that truth resides here." "Through the lanes of my land, oh, Mother.. " ".. the holiest of the yogis pass." "A lamp flickers amidst a storm." - "A lamp flickers." "Somewhere the fire of hatred rages." - "The fire of hatred rages." "Somewhere there is a tempest of injustice." "Somewhere lies a dream, shattered." "We have no worries." "God is kind to our land." "Everything here is fine." "Everything is fine." "Everything is fine." "Everything is fine." "Everything is fine." "Everything here is fine." "Come here and listen!" "Everything here is fine." "Come here and listen!" "Come here and listen!" "Somewhere there's deception in the hearts." "Somewhere, love brings along pain." "Somewhere, there are cracks in the mirror." "Somewhere, life is akin to slavery." "We have no worries." "God is kind to our land." "Everything here is fine." "Everything is fine." "Everything is fine." "Everything is fine." "Everything here is fine." - "Come here and listen!" "Everything here is fine." "Everything here is fine." "Come here and listen!" "Everything here is fine."
