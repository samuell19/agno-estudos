- I remember, I remember when I was a kid. I was walking home from school and I saw this dog in the bushes. Golden Retriever. He came out to see me and I knew he belonged to someone, he didn't have a collar on but he was really well groomed and he looked hungry. So, I gave him this peanut butter and jelly sandwich I had in my bag. He ate it and then he followed me home. I tried to hide him but of course it's this huge dog so my parents found him immediately and I begged and begged and begged them if I could keep him and they said if we couldn't find his real owner that we could. So we looked around for a couple of days and no one showed up and I got to keep him. I had my own dog, I named him Scooby. But a week went by and someone showed up. Turns out it was Scooby's real owner. I guess his real name was Milton. - That's a stupid name. - I know, way worst than Scooby. Um, and I was crushed, I cried for days and my mum ended up feeling so bad that she went out and bought me my own puppy. - Oh no, that's so sweet. - It is except that puppy was a fucking asshole. I'm serious, it wouldn't play with me, it wouldn't take treats from me. It wouldn't do anything with me. So one day, I uh... - What? Just say it, what? - I'm gonna sound like an asshole when I say this so just fair warning and the dog was an asshole to me but I took it to an alley and I just left it there. - No, no, you didn't. - I did and the crazy part is that it followed me home. The only time it ever tried to get close to me. That little asshole. - Where's the dog now? - It's still alive, it must be like 19. It won't come anywhere near me when I go visit my parents' place. - Yeah, you left him alone in the fucking alley. - He was, yeah, I did. Yup. - So, uh, why are you telling me this? - Well you told me to tell you something I never told anyone before. - And that's the story you chose? - Yeah? Yeah. - Oh, how long have I been sleeping? X, X? Are you here? - Well, good morning, Veronica. I thought you'd never wake up, how did you sleep? - Good, Papa, have you see Pigz and Blanket? I can't find them anymore. - They're out in the pen. Now Veronica I know you've been around pigs without their blankets, you know the rules, don't you? That isn't safe. - Oh, I know, Papa, but we never let it get that far. - That's okay, that's okay, my dear. Say, do you happen to remember where we put the keys to the kingdom, I'm having the darnedest time finding them. - Of course, Papa, wait a minute. Papa would never forget where the keys to the kingdom are and that picture. Pitbull Mitfull. - You outsmarted me for the last time, Veronica. - Yeah, you're fired. Why are you working here, these are good, man. You should be doing something with them. - I, it's not even done yet, I still have to make like a chase scene and there's, there's a lot to do. - Always an excuse, eh, Ben? Not enough time during office hours? - It's complicated stuff. - All right, I'm taking off. You're gonna have your real work done today? - Yes. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, are you ready for tonight? - Oh yeah, I'm gonna bring my A game. - You fabulous bastard. - Bastard, no, but I am fab. See that, see how fab it was? See it again? - Oh, I got ya. - You're welcome. - Your safety and you, Volume Eight, PPE. - Now that you've had your essential WHMIS training, it's time to get to work. Whoa, whoa, hold on there, hot shot, forgetting something? You can't enter an active work place without the proper P, P, E. That's personal protective equipment. Now we're ready. - I remember doing one of those hypnotizing, um, it was like an event at a-- - Did it work on you? - No, not at all but I pretended the other time 'cause I really wanted to stay up on stage. - Of course you would. - So I even did like the, we did the, there was like a belly dancing portion of it, we're like, if Kim Morrison started belly dancing, but we're like, I guess I have to belly dance now, so, yeah. That was a thing. - So you just belly danced. - Pretty much so. - So, uh, when are you gonna shave? - Never, why? - Well, I mean, you look just so much cleaner and more tidy without the facial hair. - Oh really? - Yeah. - I think you look really clean and tidy with no hair at all, just . - Oh, you do? - Just shave the whole thing. - I think it's a bit different though. - It's the exact same. - No. - Yeah. - No, not at all. - I have a bald face and you'd have a bald head. It'd be great. - But then like my whole, 'cause you'd have your bald face but you'd have hair on your head. - I'd shave too. - You-- - We'd be matching. - No. - We'd be a couple of Q balls. - No, I don't wanna be. - Matching tattoos on our heads. - I don't want you to be bald. I just want your face to be bald. You can keep the eyebrows. - Oh. - Hey. - Good color. - Yeah, you too. - Thanks, you ready? - Am I ready, are you ready? - You brought it, right? - No, no, I forgot to bring the one thing that I was supposed to bring. - Okay, so Caleb's on the couch, you go over there and what you're gonna do is-- - Okay, hey, hey, hey. We got this, okay? - Okay, okay. ♪ I'm looking for love ♪ ♪ I'm only human ♪ - Ben, what's happening, dude? You brought it, right? Yeah, in your face, yeah, drink up. No, no, no, no, no, all of it, all of it. All right, so I need a favor from you, okay? - Okay. - And this goes down really, ah, ham it up and go in that direction, okay? I'm gonna use the commotion to get in close. - Hey, you know this night's about Ali, right? We're not-- - I'm gonna punch you in the stomach. - What, why? - So it's authentic. - Getting punched in the stomach and choking aren't anywhere near the same-- - Holy shit, he's choking! Go with it, go with it. Holy shit, someone do the thing. - The Heimlich, the Heimlich, the Heimlich. Oh my god. - I guess I'll just come out and say it. - Wait, are you actually serious right now? - Mike, will you marry me? You said you want it unique. - Yes. - Thanks guys for coming. - Yeah, buddy. - Congrats. - Oh my god, did you see the look on Mike's face? Thanks again, man. - No problem. - And you're good with being my best man. - Yes, of course, of course. Does this mean I get to decide just how fabulous your wedding is? - Cheers, buddy. - Indeed. - Another, yep, yep. - Yes, yes. You like? - Really? - Learn to love it, Ben. Down. One more. Case, come on. - So, you gonna move out when Ali and Mike get married? - Fuck, this is gonna drive me nuts. - What? - It's only been a day and I've already had like three people ask me that. I mean why am I the one that's supposed to move out, I mean we both rent the place and it's fucking sweet, I don't wanna move, you know? - I mean, why don't you talk to them about it, I'm sure they won't mind. - Yeah, maybe. Got more in the tank, wanna keep going? - Does it look like I wanna keep going? Hey, what do I owe you? - Nothing, your money's no good here. - All right. See you around. - Sounds good, man. - Yeah. - Oh, hey, big guy. - What's up? - I'll tell you what's up. Remember the fonts you did for that boring government video? You know the ones, the ones you loved so much you wished they complained, so you get to do it all over again from the start. - No. - Mm-hm, oh yes. And the chick in charge of it, she's a peach. - You are fucking with me, right? - I most definitely am not. Excited to meet her? - Why me? - Personal touches, baby. It's what gets us the big bucks with the big clients. She just wants to go over the fonts, it'll take five minutes. - That is so minuscule, can't we do that over the phone? - Ben, the president of the company is telling you to go, suck it up, baby, we're going. We're meeting her over drinks, okay? What is it about government workers and booze anyway? Does that make it less painful? - Yes, actually it does. - Okay, you're dismissed. Hey, Ben, love you. - Love you, too. ♪ She was always just fine ♪ ♪ She was having something deep ♪ - Hi, Ali? - Ben, sorry, you must be Ms. Clement. - No, funny story, I'm her assistant and she's not coming, so. She sent me to give you her notes, so. - This is it? - Consider yourself lucky, most people that meet with her end up having a bad day. - Well, um, I'm glad we came across town for this then. - Oh yeah, I mean my boss really believes in connecting with people through you know passing notes. - All right, well, it was a pleasure to meet you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what? Isn't this supposed to be a drinks meeting? 'Cause my boss told me to buy so I think we can lead with it. - That's funny, my boss told me the exact same thing. - I guess we gotta drink. - All right, what do you want to drink? - Okay, what kind of happy hour people should we be? - Happy hour people? - Yeah, like different times of the happy hour people? Like you know what I'm talking, you don't know what I'm talking about. - Not at all. - Okay, screw that, like if you were a drink, what would you be? - Oh, ah-- - I think you're a Manhattan. - Yeah? - Yeah, I really do. Conservative but still a little like tweak over you know Old-Fashioned. - Manhattan, what kind of drink are you? - Oh, what do you think? - Ah, Cosmopolitan. - Yeah, not bad, I would go for a lychee martini though. - Well there you go. - Mm-hm, yep. Everyone is a drink. - Fair enough, well what kind of drink should we get today then? - Thank you. - Thanks. - That's cute. - I really don't like olives. - I love olives. Mm. Okay, you need to loosen up, man. - I'm sorry? - It's like talking to myself here. You like chug that martini and loosen up. - Oh, my bad. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Never had a martini before, huh? - Holy shit, I have a newfound respect for James Bond. Okay, so, um. How long have you been working for the government? - Too long. If you look at my employment record under years worked, there's like a sad face and then there's a crying face and then there's a dead face in a noose and then there's a thumbs up to encourage vertical business growth. What about you? How long have you been doing soulless corporate videos? - Um, like, four years? - You like it? - It's easy work. - Okay, so you hate it. - No, no, my best friend owns the company and he pays me well. - Okay, sure, so what do you really wanna do? Like what's your passions, what's your interests? - You don't skip a beat at all, you just jump right into it. - Mm-hm. - Cartoons, I really like making old '20s style cartoons. - Cartoons, see that's interesting. You should lead with that next time. - Well, what about you, what are your passions? - Journalism, I'm actually moving to New York at the end of the month for it. - Really? - Yeah, I mean I'm already a journalist like part-time. I've been doing it for years. - Well, that's awesome, congratulations. - Thank you. - Would you guys like another round? Happy hour's still for another five. - What do you think, another round? - Wait, another five, oh shit, no, I'm sorry, I gotta go, I'm sorry, I gotta go. Can you put this on my tab please? - No, no, no, no, my boss said we should get the round. - Come on, dude, we hired you. Plus you have already paid for it. You know, like your taxes? That's that. Okay. - Okay. - This was really fun. - Yeah, yeah, it was. - So I guess you have yourself a nice day, Benjamin. - You too. - Thank you. Just give me your phone. Just... Just to clarify, I'm not looking for anything serious and I don't do dinner or movies, okay? - Okay. - Okay then. - Ben, how was the meeting? Jesus. That's it? What's going on here, why are you all smiling and shit? Uh, Ben, how much did you put on this? I'm getting married, Ben, I don't have money for your luxury night out, Ben. - Love you. - Ben! - Can't enter an active work place without the proper PPE. - All right, classic church. - Mm, no. - No. - No one likes the church idea, eh? Yeah I don't like it either. - Why would you even consider a church? They don't even want you to get married. - That is an excellent point. - I still like the farmhouse. - Please. The farm's all right but it pales in comparison to beach wedding. - Yeah but you know the beach isn't gonna work. - How big are you guys planning on going with this? - Well I'm gonna want my whole family there. - And my mom will probably invite everyone to see how the gays do it. - Did she really say that? - Yeah. - I love your mom. - So what do you think? - Well you know the beach is rough for some people. Mom has a cane and grandpa can't be on that heat. - Okay I'm kind of pissed your mom's gonna make us miss out on a beach wedding. - I know but it's gonna be great. All of our family there, everyone that we love is gonna be there, it's gonna be incredible. - It'll be all right, man, just make her eat fish. - She does hate fish. - Okay, now this is genius. - Actually it's 100% goat milk. - Do you know why this is here? - Why? - I'll give you two to one odds that like one of these doors is paying him to be there. - Okay, explain. - Okay, you know how they say never go grocery shopping when hungry? - Yeah. - Okay, it's the opposite for furniture shopping. They want you to be full and bloated. They want you to sink in their cushions and get into naps, makes you wanna buy their shit. It's like a strategy, it's like a marketing strategy. - All right, well whose your source? - Well let's go in, shall we and we shall see. Can't you see it behind their eyes? They eat, get trucked out, walk as a happy clams picking up useless shit. - You're right. You are a good journalist. - And then they die. They fucking die, Ben. - We need to break this cycle, I don't wanna die in a furniture store. - But you do need a new table, don't you? - You're right. - Yeah. - Let's risk it. - Okay. Oh. You got me some wine? - Yes, actually, I imported the finest crystallized wine just for you. - Wow, I just don't think I can drink any. - You don't wanna drink my crystallized wine? - You've drunk some, haven't you? You've drunk some wine and now you're a part of this marketing scheme. - Join us. - No. No. No. - So what do you think? Is this the one? - I think it has sentimental value now. It has to be... - Okay, I could probably get that online for like a hundred bucks. - Okay. - Let's go. - Let's go then. - Yep. - You'll have to tell me when the table gets dropped off. I'll help you build it and I'll even bring beer. - Well how can I refuse an offer like that? - That's it. So this isn't your usual date, is it? - Oh no, it is. - Oh shit, it must be expensive. - No, no, see what I do is that we go to the store and I'm like, "Oh no, the furniture's too expensive. "I'll just go online and buy it." Then we part ways and I just don't. - That's, that's good. It's good. - Do you wanna do something fun? - Always. - Voila. - Wow. - Yeah. This is what I call fun. - You know, I'm not quite sure how to figure you. - I'm sorry you can't, you don't know how to figure me? - Okay how to figure you, figure you out. I don't know to figure you out. I'm French, okay? - Okay, why can't you figure me? - Okay, well when I first met you, you were-- - Keep in mind, that I was prepared to meet not you. - Okay, okay, that's fair. But still, I mean, you were, you know, quite shy I would say and I mean look at you now. You have me climbing trees at sunset. - Sorry. - Yeah. - It's my friend Caleb, I should-- - Of course, yeah sure. - Okay. Hello? Yep. All right, okay. Yeah, I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. So my friends are drunk and the DD can't get his car started. - Oh. - So would you like to go meet some drunk people? Uh, 27th and Main please. - So where are you from? - Montreal. - I thought I heard an accent. It means you speak French, right? - Oh, oui. - Oh, bonjour. - What does that mean? - It means you're beautiful. - You're French, have you ever been to France? - Yeah, I went last summer actually. - Awesome, was it awesome? - Yeah, it was pretty awesome. - Awesome. - Thank you for today. - No problem. - You know, Ben's probably one of the coolest guys I know. Been friends with him since I was a kid, he's a great guy right there. - Whoa, that's a long time. - Literally forever. Hey, you know what we should do? Make late night pancakes. Ali and I perfected late night pancakes. - Late night pancakes. - Yeah. - How about, man, do you want some pancakes? - If you want, man, we'll make some pancakes. - All right. - Okay but just before, you guys need to drop me off at my house 'cause I gotta get up early. - What, no, eat pancakes with us, it'll be fun. I'm like Garret Ramsey. - I trust that. - When it comes to late night pancakes. Oh, god! Man, seriously be careful, she could just be leading you on. - Why would she do that? What would that do for her? - Girls like to play games. - Yeah maybe the girls you know. - She's moving in a month, yeah. I'm sure she is, mark my words, Ben. - Don't mark anything. - Mark my words, whatever it is she's telling you, it isn't true but on the other hand, she speaks French and that's hot. - Don't listen to this, you're not gonna listen to him, are you? That girl is a good girl. - Good in the sack maybe. - Don't let this idiot get inside your head. - Like you know women-- - I do know women. - You don't wanna take lady advice from a gay man. - This gay man actually talks to women. I listen to them, that's how I know them better. Look, when you realize that I'm right. - You aren't right. - I think you should explore this. I know the whole hanging out without actually being together thing is not the Ben style but I think it's been long enough. - He's trying to say you need to get laid. - Yeah, I got that. - I mean you literally had a hot chick fall into your lap. - She didn't fall into my lap. - Fine, across from. - Don't you think you're pulling a bit of a nerve here? What if I said, "How about you go play college ball?" - Yeah, yeah, okay, Caleb didn't make the cut for college ball, get some new material, you fucking-- - See, you really wanna take advice from this hot head? - Yeah, yeah. - I don't know. - I get what you mean, I like her. She seems genuine, you know? - Good, good, follow those instincts. - But I don't think it matters anymore because I think you guys scared her off. - What did I do? - Why? - I don't know, maybe it was the three drunkskateers in the background or your interrogation or everyone yelling pancakes, pancakes, everything, it just seemed better when we were together alone, you know. I don't know, you're logical, what do you think, Mike? - I wouldn't worry about a thing. She seemed really cool and relaxed and I don't think we ruined your date night. - Yeah, I hope you're right about that. - No, trust me, by the time you get home, you'll have a text from her. Like Ali said, we're gay, we know women. - Oh fuck you both. - Fuck me? Is this finally happening? - What the hell's happening? Oh god, stop it. - The three way of our dreams. - No, no, no! What's in there, is there anymore left? - How bad do you want them? - Give it. Bad enough, okay, whatever it is you. Oh! - This suit looks look, am I right? Like I'm not crazy, this is a bitching suit. - What, what are you talking about, what's wrong with the suit? - The suit, it's an awesome suit. - Yeah, sure, it's a great suit. - Right. Mike doesn't want me to wear it to the wedding. It's his mom. She expects me to buy a new suit, a wedding suit. He's mad at me 'cause I said her fuck her. Fuck her, it's our wedding and I wore it on our first date, he loved the suit. Why shouldn't I wear the suit to our wedding? - Is this gonna be a long conversation because I can put some pants on. - You go, yeah do that. - Okay. Here you go, James Bond. - Don't ever get married, man, don't do it. It's all grandma can't go to the beach or your second cousin's allergic to garlic. Garlic for fuck's sakes. How do you develop a garlic allergy, it's in everything. - 'Cause you're a vampire clearly. - That, that's an explanation. I don't know if she'd like me saying that to her, but. Anyway just don't ever get married. It's really just not a good idea. - You're excited to get married, right? - I'm excited to be married. - You know what, you're gonna be fine. This is classic wedding shenanigans. Everybody goes through this. - Look at you, getting the real best man experience, eh? - Hm. - Cheers. Um, that's not coffee. - No, it's not. - I feel like the arrows are pointing different directions here. - You have to put your hands in front of you. - Right. Juliette? - Where are you? - Which way did you go? - I don't know. - Left? - I went through that maze. - With, with something. - Why does it stop here? We're back to the beginning? Oh no. I have to go now. - Don't leave me. - I will have to save myself. - Okay. - Sorry. Okay, you look horrified. You've been on one before, right? - Not by choice. You're not the first pretty girl that convinced me to do something stupid. - Well, it only lasts a few minutes. - You don't understand, when I'm nervous like this, I just imagine all the possible outcomes and they're all worst case scenarios. - But like what? - Oh like, you know, we get stuck at the top and I have a sudden hit of diarrhea. - Okay, that's unlikely. - Or while we're traveling at full speed, a flock of birds just comes and kills us dead. - Okay, I don't think it would kill us. - Birds can take out airplanes, I don't think meat sacks are a problem. - You're neurotic, you know that? - Okay and the worst case scenario and most likely is that as we're traveling at full speed, it just derails off a ramp and we crash to our deaths. - Oh wait. What was that sound, can you hear that? - What? - Oh my god. Caw! - Fuck off. - Yeah, I obviously like these rails like don't look, I don't know like-- - Come on. - Oh and I put laxatives in your coffee. - Don't. - I did. Thought it would be funny. Okay, it's filming now. Okay it's filming. How you feeling? - I don't-- - I'm sorry but I really did have to film this. This is gonna be too good. - We are so high already. - He's a scared pussy.

Oh. You're not gonna pup on me, are you? - I think just the roller coaster gave me cancer. - Oh, well that's not funny. I mean my uncle-- - Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

What's Ali having us do tonight? - Some sort of cake testing I think. Come on, man, get off your phone. - But chicks. I might have to bail. - What, why? - I really don't wanna go to this thing. He's pissing me off lately. He can tell if cake tastes good without me too. - What happened? - I talked to him about the apartment and you were wrong, he did care. - He wanted to keep it too, huh? - Yep, it's bullshit. He gets married and I'm supposed to give up my place so he can be all fucking grown up. - Look, I know you don't like change but this might be a good thing. You might find a sweet place. - I already have a sweet place. - Look, let's just go, show our support, have some free cake, it's his wedding after all. - Yeah, that he still has tons of time to plan.

See the crew, the screw-- - No, I know, but you gotta take this leg piece so you can make room for the leg to go, oh my god, these instructions might as well be in Swedish too, this makes no sense. - Did you know they make the instructions hard to understand on purpose? - What, really? - Yeah, they hire chronically depressed people for their phone lines and when people like us call, no one's lonely, it's like public service. - Really? - Oh my god, you're so gullible, it's not even fun! - Hey. - Hey. - Pizza's here. - Yep, there's-- Yep, 40 bucks. - Oh, okay, I see. I think I get it! Yeah, I think we had it upside down. Yeah. Yeah, we had it, okay, okay, so grab this one and like the plastic thingy too and grab these too. - Okay. - And oh we need these two, we're gonna need this. Okay and yeah, grab these ones. You okay? - Yeah. - Oh and yeah, the screws, this and you... Yeah. - I can't believe I never saw that before. - How long did that take? - Too long, an hour and-- - Oh, you regret cheaping out? - Yep. Yep, I do. - Pitbull Mitfull! - You outsmarted me for the last time, Veronica. Now I will use your favorite friends, Pigz and Blanket against you. Why don't you help them? - Please don't come near us, Princess. - It's all wrong without our blankets. We might throw up on you. - I'd start running . - How do you write the dialogues? - I just ad lib it. - Really? - Yeah, I'll get you next time, Veronica. - Well that is adorable. - Oh, thank you. - Seriously though, those cartoons are really good. - Thank you, you're sweet. I know they're nothing special but I like doing them. - Why don't you think they're special? - I don't know, I think a lot of people are convinced that they're special so they need to admit that they aren't. I mean what's the likelihood that there are that many amazing, undiscovered actors and artists out there, really? Isn't it more likely that they're just not that great and nothing's really ever gonna happen for them? - You know what I think? - Hm. - I think it's a fucking shame how few people try and I think it's a shame you're of them. You know what, we're all gonna die one day so just fuck it, try something! - Fuck it, very poetic. Can I kiss you? - Do you always ask permission? - It's better. - You're such a pussy. - I snapped my back. - Do you smoke? - No, why, do you? - Oh, on occasion. - On what occasions are those? - Well, after sex and also after sex. Do you have an ashtray? - Why would I? - Okay, fair enough. - Do you smoke often? - Maybe. - Maybe meaning like a lot or maybe a little or-- - Oh no, oh no. Maybe means-- - Is it like a once a week sort of a thing or is it like once a month sort of thing? - Okay. - Have you quit smoking for awhile? - I'm sure I can find an ashtray somewhere. - Not necessarily both. - Hey, how are you doing? - Good, how are you? - I'm good. - Good. - That's good. - Yeah. - I brought your stuff. - Awesome, yeah. - So what's new? - Mm, I'm seeing someone. - Really? - Yeah. - Well, okay. - She's pretty awesome, so that's going well, yeah. - Yeah. How'd you meet her? - Work. - Yeah? - Actually. - Cool. - Yeah. - Yeah. - How about you? - I've actually got something kind of exciting going in my life too. I'm moving to Thailand for a bit. - Really? - If you can believe it, yeah. - Congratulations, that's-- - Thank you. - That's awesome. - Yeah, yeah. You remember how I always talked about how I wanted to do yoga? - I think so, yeah. - Do you remember me talking about it? - Right, yeah, well I just, I didn't think you were that serious, that's all. - Well I was, um, I've been really getting into it lately and I've decided to go get certified. - That's awesome, congratulations. - Thank you. That's how I found your stuff. I was packing up the old crawlspace and-- - Wait a sec, um, sorry, I thought you, ah, wanted to keep, ah, living in that place. I thought that was why I moved out. - Well, I did, but then, um, this opportunity came up and I just had to take it, you know? That's actually why I asked you here. I know how much you love that apartment and I'm not gonna be in it anymore so I-- - You called me here to offer me the apartment. Why would I wanna go back there? - I just know how much you loved it. - Well then why didn't I keep it? - Wasn't it your idea to move out? - Everything's my fault, great, that's wonderful. Did you just come here to gloat about how great your life is now that I'm-- - What? - Not in it anymore or? - No, no, I wanted to do the right thing. I wanna be your friend, I... I miss you. - My friend. This is how you treat your friends, right? What's even in this box. - I don't know, it's your stuff. I figured you'd want your stuff. - My stuff. - Yeah. - Yeah. I think you just wanted to offer me your scraps. - What, no, I... I wanted to do the right thing. I wanted to give you your stuff and offer you the apartment and now you're making me out to be some kind of bad guy. - You are the bad guy. You broke up with me, you kicked me out of the apartment and now you're back here making me look like I'm some kind of asshole and I don't deserve this. - Well, well, well, look who's alive. - Hey. - What's up with you? - Nothing. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay, you gotta give me something here because I can go home and talk to myself-- - I'm sorry. I just went to go see my ex. - Oh. Oh. - Yeah, she wanted to give me a box of my old stuff. - Mm, what's in it? - I don't know, I haven't opened it. - Why not? - I just want it to be done with. - Then why would you meet up with her? - She asked me the exact same thing. - I mean... Do you want her back? - No, no, no, no, not at all, I just wanna know that she's not okay without me. I know, that makes me sound like a dick and I'm sorry. - I mean no, it's not wrong. - I'm sorry too, I don't mean to vent on you right now. - No, it's okay, it's fine, really. You know what you should do? - What? - They're just things. - It's not the things. It's the memories. You'll never get the keys to the kingdom. I'll find Papa Rooster. We'll see about that, my darling . - Hey, pay attention and one of those characters better be me. - I have actually made you a character and I call him Le Monsieur. - Oh, I'm French now. - Oui and I am fab just like you. - Okay, I think I like it . All right, help me out. Which one of these-- - Would you guys please cut it out with all this wedding stuff? I barely see him now that he's seeing the French chick. When I do, it's only because you guys are going over all this shit. Thank you. Speaking of, how's that going, you bang her yet? - Bang her yet? What are you, 14? They've only hung out like a couple of times. - So? - So not all of us bring home loose women like you. - Yeah, some girls like to wait like more than a few hours, you know. - Oh please, the girls that like to wait are the girls that wait forever because those girls aren't into you and will never sleep with you. - That is so not true. - Remind me again, how long did it take you and Mike to fuck. - That's not important, that's not the same though. - How isn't it? - Because neither of them are girls. - You know I'm right, if you've been on a week's worth of dates with someone and you haven't had sex yet, that's a red flag and you need to pull the shoot. - Pull the shoot, you're really gonna listen to a guy who says pull the shoot? And no way, she's cool, she doesn't put out a week in is a shit reason to stop seeing someone. - I said a week's worth of dates, not a weekend. Don't twist my words. - Okay now you're just running around the point and the point is she's cool. If they don't have sex, who cares. - I care, Ben needs to get some to get over his bitch ex. Sorry, dude. - Huh? Sorry, I hate to do this to you guys but I have to go, Juliette's picking me up. - So you have fucked her. - No, it's just uh we're going to the beach to have some drinks with her hot friends. - What's he talking about? - It's just Juliette, me and her insanely hot friends drinking half naked by the beach, it's dumb, it's stupid. - No, that's not dumb, no, Ben, Ben. - Thanks for the beer. - No, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ben, Ben. I'm blaming you for this. - All right, let's do this. - What are you guys talking about? - How cool are you with acid? - Aimee brought some. - What's it taste like? - Paper. - But then it's blissful. - You don't have to if you don't want to. But if you do want, it's right here. Do you want one? - Do I even know you? Of course aliens exist. - No way, no way. Do you really think there's any way that we could be visited by little, tiny, gray dudes in flying plates without the whole world knowing about it? - Yes, I do but that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is we haven't made contact yet. Maybe they're out there but-- - What if they don't have a physical form. Have you thought of that? - What? - Yes. - How can life not have a physical form? - Have you ever heard of the singularity? - Yeah, it's like. - Hey. - Hi guys. - Hey, it's like, uh, so computers are mended with-- - I'm not following, I don't wanna follow, fuck you, they don't exist. - Fuck you. - Everyone, this is Ben. - Hi, Ben. - How's it going, Ben? - Hi. - Do you think aliens exist. - Oh, I, I don't have any opinions on aliens. - Oh come on! - Okay, take it easy, first time acid trier. - Oh, I don't think I should be in this conversation. - 100% you should be in this conversation. Ben, aliens. Why don't you have an opinion on them? - Well you know how the Matrix is like a computer simulation, right? - Yeah, exactly. - Is that an okay answer? - What's wrong with you? - Fucking kidding me. - I just-- - You're so narrow minded. - I'm not, you're narrow. - Okay, come on. - Narrow minded. - This doesn't win an argument. - What was your theory? - So, Tom DeLonge, he explored aliens for a long time after leaving Blink 182. - Oh fuck that guy. - Come on. - Oh yeah, play some music for us, something nice.

Day's over, perfect. - Hey, so I wanted to ask you something. Have you ever tried dating apps? - What, why? - Okay, that's a yes. - How's that a yes? It's just a weird question to ask post sex. - How are you not used to me asking you weird shit yet? - Um... Okay, yeah, I've been on a couple. - Yep, yep, I thought you looked familiar. - Wait, did you see me on one? Before we started hanging out? And you didn't swipe right? - What, your profile didn't do it for me. - Ah, so it's like an ugly thing. - No, no, you're cute as a button. - Cute. - Okay, handsome. - Now you're just backpedaling. - As fuck. - No seriously, what didn't do it for you? - I don't know, why does it matter? - I suppose it doesn't but we're hanging out now and you didn't swipe then so it must be an ugly thing, right? - Okay, Ben, come on. - Or am I just good enough to fuck for like a month. - Well yeah obviously. - No, seriously. - Look you're making way too much of this. We're talking about online apps here. Online dating apps, why does it matter? I mean, I don't know, maybe your profile didn't do it for me because you looked relationshipy or like a serial killer in your pictures. - How are those comparable? - Who cares, why's it matter? We're here now, that's what's important, right? And like you said, we are...

Did you ever stop to think that maybe Pitbull Mitfulls are just lonely? And so she said nothing, nothing weird, nothing out of the ordinary? - No, we just talked about you the entire time. - And then what happened? - They left. - And she said nothing, nothing memorable, nothing weird? - I don't think so. - Do you wanna grab a beer? - I have this thing I gotta do. - I could really use a beer. - Okay, yeah. - Still no word, eh? - I don't get it. I don't understand, things were going... Really well. - Maybe she thinks you're getting too serious. - You're gonna be my best friend tonight. - Hey, uh, I'm just gonna look around for a bit. - Okay. - I'm gonna help you do it. Wait, which one has the ball after? I'm sorry. - Hey. - Hey Ben, what's up? - How are you? - Good. - You haven't seen Juliette, have you? - No, I thought she was coming with you. - No, I haven't been able to find her. - Oh, she's probably just late or hungover.

Just making sure everything's good. - Did you get it all finished? - Yeah. - What's going on? Did I do something to piss you off? - No. - Did something happen? - No, nothing happened. - Are you sure 'cause it seems like something happened. - Oh my god. - Does this have something to do with your divorce? - What? That's just none of your business. You're not my husband, Ben and we're not that and we're never gonna be that, fuck. - Yeah. - Ben. - Look, I get it, it's fucked up but when you stop to think about it, what did I do wrong? - Are you fucking stupid? - That's Ben's girl. - Says who? They aren't together, right? They aren't together, they aren't an item. Even they'll tell you that. - Yeah but that doesn't make it okay. - This is how Caleb gets off scot-free all the time for acting like a fucking child. - They aren't together, they can fuck whoever they want. - Are you fucking serious? - And look at you guys, hypocrites. Wanna remind me how single Mike was when you two started fucking, huh? - That's different, that's a low blow and you fucking know it. - How is it different, huh? How is it different? - 'Cause I was in love with him. - Oh, come on! You fucked him 'cause you wanted to fuck him. - You need to grow the fuck up, okay? Life isn't about fucking everything and not caring anymore. People have lives, okay, you can't just fuck 'em up 'cause you feel like it. - You are such a fag! - Hey, why, why did you? What is wrong with you? - I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry. - Ben. Ben. Hey. I'm sorry, you don't deserve that. - Why didn't you tell me you were married? - Why would I, what's to say? - Well, if it gets a reaction like that, clearly a lot. - Look. When I first met my husband, my ex-husband, we had this, this like crazy, intense passion and so we got married. But you just can't love someone that fast, you know? I mean what we had was amazing because it was never meant to be complete and once it was... It was just... Look, Ben. I'm kind of fucked up and I know you want to be the one that fixes that, but it's not your fault and you're not the bad guy. I'm gonna go. I'm just gonna go. - Juliette, wait. - I don't want you to need me, Ben. - I know. It's just... It's been really good getting to know you. - Yeah. It was. - I know you're gonna hate this but... Do you want to come back to my place? Hey, you awake? - Yeah. I'm gonna miss you, you know? - Yeah, I'm gonna miss you too. I'm really glad we got to do this. - Yeah, me too. Don't even have to switch the fingers. - So that one-- - Easy right? - So, three and then the two on. - Make it, make a song. - Okay. - About whatever you want. ♪ It makes me sad that I make you sad ♪ ♪ It makes me cry but I'm not your wife ♪ ♪ I've done things that I couldn't tell you ♪ ♪ Maybe that's what keeps our feelings apart ♪ ♪ I'll ♪ I don't remember. - You just switched that to a completely different chord there. - That's why I was stopping there, okay, your go. - Okay. - Give me the phone. - You're not telling him. - Yes, I am, I have to. - Why? - Because he should know the truth. - No, he shouldn't, he's happy now. - You're saying like I'm trying to hurt him. - Look, if you tell him all you'll do is ruin what he had with her. One sec. - Look, we're gonna bury this, he's not gonna find out and that's the least you could do for him, okay? - Start looking for your own place. Hey. - Whoa, what happened to you? - Don't, uh... Don't bang people's girlfriends. - You finally got a violent one, eh? Did you guys see who fucked him up? - No, we left just after you did. - Are you gonna be okay? That looks... Not fun. - Yeah. - You know, I've been thinking. - What's that? - Your wedding. You guys are so worried about what you're supposed to do, right, but it's your day, isn't it? Shouldn't it make you happy? I think you should just get married today. - That would be pretty great, wouldn't it? - I'm serious. Caleb and I will be witnesses, I'll call an officiant. We'll get you chain and shackled beach style, do it. - All five of us are gathered here today to marry these two quicker than a green card wedding. Do you, Mike, take Ali to be your husband? - I do. - Do you, Ali, take Mike to be your husband? - Of course I do. - I now pronounce you husband and husband, kiss him! Congratulations. - How you feeling? - It was a lot . - That was good. This is a good first step, Ben. This is what life is about. Trying stuff. I'm crying because I got makeup in my eye. - Yeah, I think I got some too. - Well there was no bird, no birds. - I guess not, although I think I might've had diarrhea. - No birds, no di, oh, diarrhea? That's unfortunate. Oh, he's smiling, he had fun.
