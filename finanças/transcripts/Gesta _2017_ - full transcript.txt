How naive can one be? ﻿As naive as the expression on my face when I thought I had the world on a string. ﻿I had no idea then ﻿that a minute later everything would change. ﻿When life smiles at you, punch it right in the face. ﻿Sometimes you run away first ﻿and only figure out why later. ﻿It's a long way down! ﻿How did we end up here just when everything seemed perfect? ﻿For that we have to go back a month. ﻿We may not have been the most popular kids in the boarding school, ﻿but when you're summoned to the principal, it's never a good sign. ﻿My first instinct is to invent an excuse ﻿that'll cover any possible complaint. ﻿Shahar, as always, is lost in an online game ﻿with some skater from Brazil or something. ﻿And Pita? Nowhere to be found, as usual. ﻿Sit down, kid! ﻿Ate two lunches today, huh, Pita? ﻿You'll need a lot of water to wash that down. ﻿Don't worry, there's plenty here. ﻿Drink up, Pita, there's plenty more where that came from. ﻿Oh, Adam, Shahar, come in, sit down. ﻿Where's Yoav? ﻿Who? -Yoav. ﻿Pita. ﻿Oh. He's on his way. ﻿He had a brief delay. ﻿Homework, probably. He likes to help other kids during recess. ﻿Sorry I'm late. -It's okay, Yoav. ﻿Come in, sit down. ﻿I wanted to break the news... ﻿Sir, I know it's school policy to kick out a student with seven "Fails," ﻿but do me one last favor. ﻿I promise I'll do better. -Relax, Adam. Okay? ﻿I have good news for you. ﻿The app you were asked to create... -"Favor." ﻿Yes, "Favor." Well, ﻿it was chosen by our computer lab's sponsors ﻿to receive extra funding. ﻿Funding? ﻿You've all split into threesomes except for Yoav here. ﻿Who else doesn't have a group? ﻿Good, two is a start. ﻿Good morning. Have a nice day, everyone. ﻿Has the Ritalin taken effect, Adam? ﻿Actually, I didn't take it today. ﻿Teacher, I was wondering, ﻿instead of giving a whole class Ritalin, ﻿why not give one teacher Ecstasy? ﻿I hear Israel has a shortage of comedians, ﻿I'm glad you're joining the national effort. ﻿I was helping the janitor paint the fence. ﻿A janitor is all you'll be, Adam Ben-Artzi, ﻿if you don't start coming to class on time. ﻿But I'm thrilled you're here. Now you're a threesome. ﻿Who? -Yoav is good at computers, ﻿you're a gifted designer, and Adam... ﻿makes three. ﻿Have a seat. Good luck. ﻿For you slow-pokes and latecomers, ﻿your project for next time is an internet marketing scheme. ﻿The measure of success is revenue. Money, people. ﻿It can be a social media project, an app, it's up to you. ﻿The only condition is that the beta version is less than 128 Giga ﻿and will fit on a USB stick like this one. ﻿Meet Attorney Gvili, ﻿founder and CEO of the Element Foundation, ﻿a startup think-tank which works with our school. ﻿And also donates to your computer lab. ﻿The coffee's gross, Menashe. ﻿I'll be honest. We're very impressed with your app. ﻿The idea, the follow-through, the interface, ﻿the compression into 120 Giga, ﻿it's amazing that the app's main server fits on a USB stick. ﻿In a word, it kicks ass. ﻿Am I allowed to say "ass" in school? ﻿You're allowed to. What we really liked is that you reached 15,000 users in three days. ﻿That's a lot. ﻿Open your tablets, ﻿you can see the stats on how many people downloaded Favor... ﻿Excuse me, ﻿we don't have tablets. ﻿It's Shahar, isn't it? ﻿You're the youngest here, you skipped two grades, ﻿between 7th and 8th and then 10th and 11th. ﻿Great, she's a genius. But we still don't have tablets. ﻿From now on.. ﻿you do. ﻿Tablets... ﻿You didn't come here just to give us tablets, did you? ﻿Of course not... ﻿Adam. -Adam Ben-Artzi. ﻿If I'm not mistaken, your father is... -Irrelevant. ﻿Skip it. ﻿Got it. ﻿Our R department priced the app at 1 shekel per user. ﻿15,000 users makes 15,000 shekels ﻿for the three of you as of now. ﻿So you want to buy our app for 15,000 shekels? ﻿Yes and no. ﻿Buy it, yes.L For 15,000, no. ﻿I believe that Element can bring Favor to 150,000 users within a month, ﻿so take 150,000 now ﻿and let us figure out where to go from here. ﻿If you accept the offer, ﻿we'll donate another 50,000 to the school. ﻿You can buy a new coffeemaker for the teacher's lounge ﻿instead of the crap you serve now. ﻿can say "crap," can't I? ﻿Just worry about yourselves, okay? ﻿Do what's best for you. -Well, then... ﻿I say... -We need to think about it. ﻿Think about it? ﻿Remember who wrote the code? ﻿And remember who designed the interface? ﻿As long as you remember whose idea it was. ﻿Good luck, Madame, Pita. ﻿Where are you going? -You heard the teacher, ﻿I have nothing to contribute. ﻿The only thing ﻿this guy does better than eating schnitzel ﻿is doing algorithms, ﻿you were unanimously elected designer, ﻿and I'll come to class to pick up the grade. ﻿That doesn't change the fact that we don't have an idea. ﻿It's true. Not even Pita... ﻿I mean Yoav. -Pita is fine. ﻿Not even Pita can write code without an idea. ﻿Shahar, do me a favor, ﻿go draw a manga in your notebook. ﻿Not a bad idea. ﻿Now you're quitting, too? ﻿No, I meant the idea of a favor. ﻿A favor app. ﻿You do me a favor and I'll do you a favor in return. ﻿Dumb idea. -Think about it, Pita, ﻿what do people like you have plenty of? ﻿Besides obesity, high blood sugar and cholesterol? ﻿You have skills, capabilities, but what don't you have? ﻿Self-awareness, sense of shame, ﻿muscle mass. ﻿Money. -Money? ﻿Yeah, money. ﻿You have no... I mean, we have no money. ﻿So we'll build an app where, ﻿instead of paying for a favor with money, you pay with another favor. ﻿A favor for a favor. Barter. ﻿Say you need someone to write a history paper, ﻿you'd walk his dog for six months in exchange, wouldn't you? ﻿I told you, it's brilliant. ﻿Brilliant? Mediocre. ﻿Nobody wants people to know they copy history papers ﻿or do that kind of favors. ﻿Unless we do it on a darknet network, ﻿then nobody can track down the IP address ﻿of whoever offers or receives the favor. ﻿Cool. Darknet. Whatever you say. ﻿Now that's what I call teamwork. ﻿Programmer, designer, and put me down as copywriter. ﻿All I'm saying is that 50,000 each can get us through the year, ﻿but half a million, a million, will set us up for life. ﻿Where'll you find that kind of money? ﻿The guy thinks we're geniuses. ﻿He did his homework on us. ﻿We're worth way more than 150,000 to him. ﻿The coffee isn't as bad as you say. ﻿Maybe the aftertaste ﻿is from the grammar teacher's lipstick, you see? ﻿Not even bleach takes it off. I've tried. ﻿We appreciate your offer, Mr. Gvili, ﻿but we've decided to turn it down. We're keeping Favor for ourselves. ﻿I'm disappointed. ﻿Me, too. ﻿But let's not just throw the offer away. ﻿You have a month to think about it. ﻿Meanwhile, come see what cooperating with Element ﻿can do for you. ﻿I've never found a suit that fit me. ﻿My legs are killing me. ﻿Actually, the look suits you. ﻿Thanks for the clothes, Mr. Gvili. ﻿Don't mention it. ﻿I'd offer you a whisky ﻿but I don't want your parents to be mad at me. ﻿I'm not used to making offers to 18-year-olds. ﻿On the other hand, it's not every day that a 12th-grader ﻿gets 217,000 users in less than a week, ﻿and that's before we released the gift I prepared for you. ﻿A limousine for a date in exchange for a doctor's note for 7 days of sick leave, ﻿charge your phone in exchange for emergency babysitting services, ﻿or just a hush-hush favor? ﻿In a word: Need help? Search Favor. ﻿Favor, the new app that fixes everything. ﻿No questions, 100% anonymous, under the radar. ﻿get online, search for Favor, ﻿and get immediate results in your area. ﻿Your parents will hate it, ﻿you won't manage without it. ﻿Need help? Search for Favor. ﻿Wow. ﻿Friends, I'm basing my offer for Favor on 450,000 users. ﻿That's 150,000 shekels for each of you. ﻿You'll have plenty of time to discuss it at the pool. ﻿What pool? ﻿The pool at the villa that Element is renting for you. ﻿How do you prefer your palace, ﻿modern or Oriental? ﻿The more expensive one. ﻿Correct answer, young man. ﻿What's to eat around there? ﻿Whatever you want, whenever you want, as much as you want. ﻿Actually, I'm starving. ﻿That reminds me, just this week I ate a prime cut ﻿at Aviv Moshe's new restaurant. Amazing. ﻿Liron, get us reservations for four at Quatro for... ﻿15 minutes from now. ﻿15 minutes? ﻿Was your chauffeur a Formula 1 champion? ﻿A lieutenant colonel. In the Air Force. ﻿No way is this for real. -No way is this for real. ﻿No way am I getting in. ﻿What's your problem? -I'm acrophobic, Shahar, ﻿1 m not Setting in that thing. ﻿For real? It's all in your head. Statistically, you have 100 times greater chance ﻿of getting hurt in a car accident than in a flight. ﻿Statistically, the second we take off I'm gonna barf all over you. ﻿Hurry up, Favors, the food's in the oven. ﻿Food! ﻿Adam, this is your chance to take life by storm, ﻿don't miss it. ﻿Come on, I'll hold your hand. ﻿Folks, any room left for corn ravioli? ﻿We'll make room. Bring it on. ﻿Corn ravioli for the young man, ﻿they'll have the desserts to go, I have to get back to the office. ﻿Okay. -And I'll have the check. ﻿Gvili, it's on me this time, ﻿next time I'll charge you double. ﻿Enjoy, friends. ﻿Yes? ﻿I said I'd email you, didn't I? ﻿Then why do you keep bugging me? ﻿I can't believe this is happening. ﻿It's like we won the lottery. ﻿My parents will die when they hear about this. ﻿Listen to Miss High-and-Mighty. ﻿You have two parents, too, Adam, ﻿even if you're in denial. ﻿So it's true? ﻿Your dad really is in jail? ﻿Bummer, ﻿here's the food, just as things are getting interesting. ﻿Who gets the corn ravioli? -That's me. ﻿Lamb chops? ﻿That's me. ﻿And... -Over here. ﻿Who cleans plates faster, ﻿the kitchen staff or him? ﻿Don't be mean. ﻿Mean? Me? ﻿I'm the national champion in helping old ladies across the street. ﻿That's sweet of you. ﻿Oh, they're calling you at that table. ﻿What's your problem? -Helping old ladies cross the street? ﻿Couldn't you be even more pathetic? ﻿It's late. We'll meet on Tuesday ﻿and wrap it up in two minutes. ﻿Bye. -So, staying for the after-party? ﻿At 4 a.m. we have a Dutch DJ arriving, ﻿we change the whole crew, cool people, awesome party. ﻿"After," "later," ﻿if it's a party, I'm in. ﻿Is it morning already? ﻿Whoa, what a party. ﻿I'm exhausted. ﻿Are we still at the Quatro? ﻿Not any more. ﻿Where are we? -Home. ﻿Is this the modern one or the Oriental one? ﻿The expensive one. ﻿Yours for the next month. ﻿Oh, and I took the liberty of hiring someone to help you settle in. ﻿His name is Yosef ﻿and his resume is impressive. ﻿He studied at Oxford, got a degree in English Lit, ﻿nice guy. ﻿He also has credit cards for you, platinum, of course. ﻿Bye. ﻿Come, come on in. ﻿Gentlemen, miss, ﻿welcome to your home for the next month. ﻿Pleased to meet you. Yosef, your personal butler. ﻿Butler? -Aide, servant, housefather, ﻿pool-mother, butler. ﻿You must be Ms. Shahar. ﻿Ms. Shahar, that's me. ﻿And you must be Mister... -Adam. ﻿Mr. Adam. ﻿But Sir Adam is fine, too. ﻿And you, sir? -Pita. ﻿Mr. Pita. ﻿Like Lord Sandwich. ﻿I wonder where the name comes from. ﻿Sounds Mediterranean if I'm not mistaken. ﻿It comes from pita, you know the pocket bread? ﻿Sometimes people put in tahina, shawarma... ﻿Fascinating. -Pita. ﻿I could listen for hours, but you must want to settle in. ﻿I took the liberty of packing your suitcases in advance, ﻿they'll arrive in a few minutes. ﻿Meanwhile, let me show you around the space. ﻿Food, laundry, cleaning, shopping, pencil-sharpening, ﻿Yosef does it all. ﻿You just focus on your app. It's called Favor, right? ﻿One thing, if you don't mind, ﻿if someone could hold a corner when I change the duvet cover, ﻿that's complicated. Besides that, it's all Yosef. ﻿What's that? ﻿The Smart House. ﻿Pita is smart, too, but he doesn't come with a technician. ﻿Well put, Sir Adam, ﻿your home is both beautiful and intelligent. ﻿Five minutes and Yosef will have installed the system. ﻿Lights, air conditioning, who comes in, who goes out, ﻿cameras so you can see what's happening in the house, ﻿all run by a remote app, any time, from anywhere. You can even call me through the built-in call system. ﻿Yosef. ﻿If you're in a familiar mood you can call me Yossi. ﻿In a British mood? Joseph. ﻿Prefer Middle Eastern? ﻿Yussuf. ﻿No matter which, Yosef is on the way. ﻿Yeah, why work so hard? ﻿That's how it is when Mr. Gvili likes someone, ﻿but unfortunately, this house has one problem. ﻿I apologize from the bottom of my heart, but there's only one pool. ﻿Unacceptable. ﻿Disgraceful. ﻿What is this? -There are 1,000 bottles in here! ﻿Slap me, I must be dreaming! ﻿Just an expression... -I don't know what to think of all this luxury. ﻿He wants something from us. ﻿It's all on the table, Adam. ﻿He wants to buy Favor so he's giving us ﻿a taste of the good life. ﻿I just hope he doesn't take us for fools. ﻿If this is a fool's life, i'll take it ﻿You'll take anything with carbs. ﻿Gvili is spending hundreds of thousands on us, ﻿and for every hundred-thousand we must be worth a million. ﻿Welcome to the Inner Sanctum, ﻿the heart and brain of Favor, all ready for your interface, ﻿just plug and play. ﻿All we need is a USB input. ﻿Is that all? Magnificent! ﻿In any case, Mr. Gvili's instructions are that this room be limited-access ﻿for the sake of data security. ﻿Only you and Mr. Gvili are authorized to enter ﻿using an eye scanner. ﻿Let's perform the initial scan. ﻿Say cheese. -Cheese. ﻿Congratulations. ﻿How do you like your steak, sir? ﻿Very much. ﻿I mean how do you like it done? ﻿It's all good, just toss me a few mediums ﻿while I'm waiting for the well-dones. ﻿Ms. Shahar, if the tide carries you away and you feel you're in danger, ﻿raise your hand and Yosef will jump right in, ﻿I'm an certified lifeguard. ﻿By the way, did you know that the number one cause of drowning is... ﻿water? ﻿So what's your dream, Adam? ﻿Nothing in particular. ﻿Impossible. Everyone has a dream, even me. ﻿Although I could be your father, no? ﻿You're not like my father, Gvili, believe me. ﻿In a moment I'll toss you a number in shekels. ﻿It'll be my last offer for Favor. ﻿Take your time, the villa's yours for a month in any case, ﻿but first I'll give you a tip to last a lifetime. ﻿You know the difference between a smart person and a smartass? ﻿A smart person knows what's good for him, ﻿a smartass thinks he knows what's good for him. ﻿Be smart, Adam. ﻿Be smart and you'll be happy. ﻿What's the number, Gvili? ﻿A million. ﻿For each of you. ﻿Think about it. ﻿Did Gvili go? ﻿Yeah, just now. ﻿He made his final offer. ﻿A million shekels each. ﻿Pita, no more carbs. ﻿I'll change your name to Loaf. ﻿A million shekels each? ﻿If he offered 3 million we're worth 30. ﻿Or he'll drop his offer and well have nothing. ﻿Pita, somewhere in that body of yours, ﻿that four-door fridge, ﻿there must be a pair of balls. ﻿Leave his body alone. He has a mind, too. ﻿I know, that's why he needs to realize ﻿that if we keep Favor for ourselves, invest, develop, upgrade, ﻿you won't be Pita any more, you'll be a whole bakery. ﻿If we have a month to think about it, let's take it. ﻿My dears, one thing's for sure, you're in the big leagues now, ﻿and that means you need to make a change. ﻿What kind of change? -Everyone needs change, ﻿but now you have the money to make it, ﻿no matter what sort of change, ﻿your behavior, your personality, ﻿your weight... ﻿I suggest that two of you tell the third how he could improve. ﻿What would you say about Mr. Pita? ﻿That's an easy one. -Food addict. ﻿Rhinoceros. -Big eyes. ﻿Dumpster for candy. ﻿Big bones. ﻿Big butt. ﻿I get the impression you think I should lose weight. ﻿It's an option. -And we're glad you're the one that brought it up, Pita. ﻿Okay. ﻿Shahar. Next. ﻿I have no... ﻿Problematic style. ﻿I don't... -Unflattering look. ﻿Makeup's too dark. ﻿I could think of a minor alteration, but... ﻿You could smile once in a while. ﻿A makeover? Fine. ﻿But nothing drastic, right? ﻿No, not at all. Well, I'm late. ﻿Sit down. You think you don't have problems? ﻿Nobody's perfect. ﻿I think you're stubborn, inflexible ﻿and untrusting. -I'll take note of that. ﻿See? That's what I mean. ﻿But I have a solution. -Great. WhatsApp it to me. ﻿I think you should get back in touch with your dad. ﻿Yeah, just because your dad's in jail doesn't mean you have to cut him off. ﻿Pita, butt out. -Family means everything. ﻿You deal with your problems and I'll deal with mine. ﻿Talk to him, at least. ﻿And say what? ﻿That he's an asshole? That he destroyed our family? ﻿That I moved to a boarding school because of him? ﻿That because he has sticky fingers ﻿and embezzled millions_ every kid in school pointed at me ﻿when I was just 13? ﻿That mothers wouldn't let me play with their kids? ﻿Fuck him! And if he were here, that's exactly what I'd tell him, ﻿so get off my case. ﻿That went well, all in all. ﻿I didn't mean to rub salt in your wound, ﻿but you have to... ﻿Shall we eat? -Sit down. You're not going anywhere. ﻿How can I lose weight if you won't let me move? ﻿I'll show you. -What are you doing? ﻿Making an order. -Really? For what? ﻿A personal trainer. ﻿Looking for a trainer in exchange for free use of a villa gym ﻿plus half-Olympic size pool. ﻿And... Search Favor. ﻿Can't wait to see who the gung-ho gorilla is. ﻿Who's Yoav? ﻿Me. -Me. ﻿Me, too. ﻿Chill. This is Yoav. ﻿He prefers "Pita." ﻿I knew it was me. ﻿Nice to meet you. Adi. ﻿Keep it up, keep it up! ﻿A 6.12% increase in three hours is incredible. ﻿If a broker told me about a stock like this ﻿I'd call him a crook. ﻿As you can see, it's all for real. ﻿I'll be honest with you. ﻿I have another offer, just as attractive, ﻿from some kid in Kazakhstan, ﻿but something about you tells me you're the ones. ﻿It's time to decide, friends. We can't decide without Adam. ﻿And when's he coming? -Just a sec. ﻿And a pool. Not that big. ﻿Half-Olympic sized. ﻿Chill, I'm on my way. ﻿Adam, it's urgent. We have to decide today. ﻿My battery's dying, I'll be there soon. ﻿No time. Find a phone, we'll have a conference call ﻿with Gvili. ﻿Just a sec. Can I have your phone? ﻿Sure, write it down. ﻿054... -I meant your actual phone. ﻿Oh... sure. ﻿Adam's with us. Go on. -Okay, it's like this. ﻿Every year, Element International ﻿invests in only one app by young developers. ﻿There's interest in an app by a Kazakh kid ﻿but I'm still on your side, ﻿and I'm still the CEO. ﻿Come here and work it out, okay? ﻿Bye. -I'm on my way. ﻿I have a meeting with my lobbyist in the Knesset. ﻿Tell Adam that the month we talked about is about to end. We will. ﻿Pate foie gras for the lady, ﻿and green salad for the gentleman. ﻿Does the green salad... ﻿come with extras? ﻿Not really, but I can tell the chef it's for Favor. ﻿What extras would you like? ﻿Lamb chops and beef tenderloin. ﻿No problem. I'm here. ﻿Did you have to be late? It was important. ﻿I met Gvili outside, he filled me in, ﻿it's us or the Kazakh kid. ﻿We're on it, right? ﻿Excuse me? ﻿Is this chair available? ﻿Yes. -No. ﻿Actually, I just wanted to ask you something. ﻿Are you Adam? ﻿I can be Abraham if you'd prefer. ﻿Do I know you? ﻿No, sorry. I'm Hadar. ﻿Then I do know you. ﻿You're Hadar, I'm Adam... ﻿That's good enough for me. ﻿So... ﻿Me and my girlfriend... ﻿have a bet whether you're the Adam who invented the Favor app. ﻿Ever heard of it? -Favor? ﻿Yeah, I've heard of it. ﻿Which of you said it's me? ﻿Her, actually. -You lose. ﻿Sad smiley. ﻿Smiley thinks he's hot shit. ﻿You surprise me. ﻿I mean, no disrespect, ﻿but you don't look full of cash. ﻿I guess I owe you one. -Watch out, ﻿I always collect my debts. ﻿I promise to watch out. ﻿Come over for a basketball game tonight? ﻿I'm a big Maccabi fan. -Great. ﻿We'll work something out. ﻿App owner, you say? ﻿Could work. ﻿Call me at nine. ﻿Wait, you didn't give me your number. ﻿How will I know if you've got any brains if I tell you? ﻿You've got a gazillion shekels, ﻿now you have a challenge, too. ﻿Wow. ﻿Shall we order sushi? I'm still stuffed from the apple I ate last night, so... ﻿I hope you like popcorn. ﻿I can make room. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Knicks vs. Lakers, game 3 of the playoffs. ﻿Knicks? I told you I'm a Maccabi fan. ﻿I heard you. ﻿You gave me a challenge, so... ﻿Get out! ﻿What's up, bro? ﻿All good? -How's it going. ﻿Nice to meet you. Guy. -Likewise. Hadar. ﻿What's up? -Awesome. -Hey. ﻿Wow, babe! ﻿Go, Knicks! ﻿You said you always collect your debts. I didn't want any trouble. ﻿You know what I'd love right now? ﻿What? ﻿To go to your computer room and... ﻿take it from there. ﻿That's a bit of a problem. ﻿I can't let anyone in. ﻿Why don't we just go to my room? ﻿Sad smiley. ﻿Babe, I'd love to go to your computer room and... ﻿take it from there. ﻿Dammit, Dima! ﻿Sorry, boss. ﻿You know how many bacteria there are on a prison phone? ﻿It'll never happen again, boss. ﻿Dial, Igor. ﻿Hello? ﻿Hello will you accept a collect call from Rimonim Prison? ﻿Rimonim? -Yes, Rimonim, ﻿From the prisoner Rafi Ben-Artzi. ﻿Rafi Ben... ﻿Oh... Yes, of course. ﻿Hello? -Hello, Rafi. Nice to meet you. ﻿This is Shahar, Adam's girlfriend. ﻿I mean, a good friend of Adam's. ﻿I get it. ﻿Thanks for accepting my call. That's the procedure here. ﻿I called right back when I realized it was about Adam. ﻿I'm trying to arrange a meeting between you. ﻿I mean... ﻿a visit to the... place where you're... ﻿staying... living... ﻿In jail. It's all right. ﻿He really misses you, Rafi. ﻿I mean, he won't say it out loud, but he... ﻿He misses you. ﻿I sent him dozens of letters, birthday presents... ﻿he didn't even write back. ﻿That must be because he's so busy with the app. ﻿What app? ﻿Favor, the app we developed. ﻿It's a social network for trading favors. ﻿It's hot and it's gonna be worth a fortune. ﻿A fortune? Nice. ﻿Maybe Adam will visit you this week. ﻿It means a lot to him. ﻿I'll be waiting. ﻿And if you could tell him ﻿Never mind, I'll tell him. ﻿Thanks, Shahar. Bye. ﻿Bye, Rafi. ﻿Pita? ﻿Why do you look so worried? ﻿We're a bunch of idiots. ﻿Why, what happened? -What happened? ﻿Some hacker on the other side of the world got past our firewall ﻿and played with our database. ﻿How'd you let that happen?! ﻿You wanted to launch right away ﻿and show Gvili we can get users. ﻿I said fast, not unsecured! ﻿What's all the fuss about? ﻿Some dumb-ass kid with Coke-bottle glasses ﻿and a face full of zits in some dump in Taiwan ﻿took over our database. ﻿He cracked our server codes ﻿and he's trying to get some of our users' IPs. ﻿iiuoog ﻿In your face, motherfucker! -Is that it? ﻿We have to upgrade our security. ﻿Users bring money, ﻿money buys security. ﻿Capiche? -Feels like after a workout. ﻿Shit... I'm late for my workout! ﻿Adi'II kill me! -Wait, Pita...! ﻿So... ﻿Come here often? ﻿I live next door. -You don't say? ﻿Funny, me too. ﻿Yet we haven't... -Met? ﻿I've seen you around, actually, ﻿with some total retard. Hadar something. ﻿I thought you were her tutor. ﻿So much forthat... ﻿Goodbye. ﻿Don't you dare collapse now. ﻿Don't fall, Pita! ﻿A pita that falls is a pita with... -A hole. ﻿And all the tahina drips out. ﻿Two more squats! ﻿Two, one, ﻿and... that's all for today ﻿Break. ﻿Somewhere between the TRX and the pushups ﻿my lung fell out. ﻿Time for presents. ﻿I think you'll like this, ﻿and it'll help me keep tabs on you. ﻿I'm not into jewelry. -Relax, Pita. ﻿It's a Mi band. ﻿It has a GPS, calorie counter, you name it, ﻿and this way I'll always know ﻿exactly how many stairs you climbed, what you ate and where you are. ﻿Why don't you just stay with me? ﻿Maybe. But just in case I'm not there with you. ﻿And one more thing. ﻿Two lunchboxes. ﻿One for sandwiches... Healthy sandwiches, right? ﻿And one for vegetables. ﻿Vegetables... ﻿I thought Adi told you to stay away from the fridge after five. ﻿I was looking for the celery ﻿so I pushed the schnitzels aside. ﻿You wouldn't know celery if it bit you on the butt. ﻿Lie to me, but you can't lie to yourself. ﻿You'd be surprised, ﻿I've been lying to myself for years and it works fine. ﻿I don't want to stand between you and your schnitzel, ﻿but I thought you wanted to lose weight. ﻿It was your idea. ﻿For the sake of your health, that's all. ﻿Because in terms of looks, you're totally cute. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Could you possibly be more enthusiastic? ﻿I'm sick of being "cute." I don't wanna be cute any more. ﻿You're much more than cute, ﻿and one day someone will want you for who you are, as you are. ﻿Don't get me wrong, ﻿even your mom won't recognize you when you're done. ﻿My mom is dead. ﻿Sorry. -It's okay. ﻿It happened when I was in 3rd grade. ﻿Food can't really make up for... ﻿not having a mom. ﻿Congratulations, you've figured out I'm an emotional eater. ﻿It only took you two days and two hours. ﻿You have to change your habits, Pita honey. ﻿I'm behind you all the way ﻿and I promise I won't let you fall. ﻿My word. ﻿What's going on here? ﻿Ask the boss. ﻿Shahar, what is this? ﻿Just a few ramps. ﻿Are you crazy? -Thanks for your concern, ﻿but I've been skateboarding since I was 5. ﻿That's it. -Great, thanks. ﻿Why didn't you ask me first? ﻿Too rich to be considerate? ﻿If you don't mind, ﻿this is all about consideration. ﻿It's for my gang from the 'hood who dream of having a skatepark. ﻿Your gang is still back in the 'hood, thank God. ﻿That's true, but believe it or not, ﻿an Element limo is bringing them here. ﻿Omer, glad you're here. -Glad to be here. ﻿Not only because of the ramps. ﻿And the winner of this week's Favor competition is... are... am... ﻿the girl who failed five driving tests on a motorcycle ﻿and is looking for someone who looks like her to take the sixth test ﻿in exchange for a hacked iPhone. ﻿Think we should block her? ﻿Block her, arrest her, ﻿replace her whole brain programming, ﻿and most important, get rid of all these skateboards! ﻿What's going on here? ﻿Shahar opened a skatepark. ﻿She's become a social worker. ﻿Good morning, Joe. ﻿What's in there? ﻿Please be so kind as to lift the lid. ﻿Joe, you rule. What is it, breakfast? ﻿Scrambled eggs? -Even better, if you'll just open the... ﻿Lunch? Meat? You're a god! ﻿Relax, Pita, it's not food. ﻿Why do you have to ﻿get my hopes up? ﻿"Favor, the meteoric app that reached ﻿"1.5 million users in a week and a halfL will be crowned ﻿"the year's most promising app today." ﻿1.5 million users? Maybe yesterday. ﻿1,924,000. ﻿Nice of you to come, Skateboard. ﻿We're on the red carpet today, so get ready. ﻿I'm making you an appointment. ﻿For what? ﻿Surgery, ﻿to remove your wheels. ﻿Did someone order... ﻿Hold on, who are you? ﻿The Makeover Crew. -Is there a Shahar here? ﻿Is Shahar a boy or a girl? -Hope it's a boy. ﻿Check this place out. ﻿Fantabulous. ﻿Hold your tongue, pussycat. ﻿Peewee's playhouse. -Daddy, it hurts. ﻿Oh my god, I'm ovulating. -Dazzling. ﻿Razzling. -Spazzling. ﻿This way. ﻿Let me introduce you. Shahar. ﻿Doctor, we have a bad case of skateboarditis here. ﻿Honey, cancel our 4:30 appointment. ﻿What's the matter with how I look? ﻿Nothing. Your style is unique. ﻿Your clothes are totally '90s. ﻿Of the 14th century. ﻿Gag me with a spoon. ﻿With legs like yours, to go without heels... ﻿Is a crime. -Is a crime. ﻿Heels? On a skateboard? ﻿Honey, cancel 6:30, too. ﻿What's up with the black mambo nail polish? ﻿That's how the Holocaust started. ﻿You don't really expect... ﻿Okay, bye then. ﻿Two minutes, you guys. Make yourselves at home. ﻿Of course, doll, ﻿it's just like my house. ﻿Sister, if this is your style I'll do your place just like it... ﻿your studio apartment on the south side. ﻿Dream on, sweetheart. ﻿Can't afford a Starbucks macchiato and she wants a villa. ﻿Chill, ho'. -Lowlife. ﻿Barren bitch. ﻿My sweet Lord. -Going around without heels... ﻿It's a crime. -It's a crime. ﻿Pass me the mouse-gray concealer. ﻿All out. Only cockroach-brown left. ﻿I'm gonna die. What a face. ﻿Straight to Wedgebook. ﻿Talk about "before" and "after..." ﻿Totally, sweetie. -It's not too short? ﻿Baby, you've gone from a 2-shekel look to a million dollars. ﻿From the Bowery to Central Park West. ﻿What's wrong with the Bowery? -Hey, ﻿mind your language. ﻿What a coquette. -Dazzling. ﻿Razzling. -Spazzling. ﻿Lovely, simply lovely. ﻿I... need to get used to it. ﻿You're a whole new person. ﻿Pippa Middleton at Princess Kate's wedding. ﻿Oh, by the way, you've got an awesome app. ﻿Yeah, I just "Favored" someone to apprentice me. ﻿She's taking my Chihuahua to the hairdresser's. ﻿Hey, why didn't you ask me? ﻿I didn't want her back in fuchsia pink, sweetie. ﻿Tone it down, lowlife. ﻿Which reminds me, how are we getting to the launch? ﻿As the Duke of Yorkshire said, ﻿every silver lining has a gray cloud. ﻿It's all right. ﻿I have an idea. ﻿You can take them off now. ﻿The showroom is ours for the next five minutes. ﻿You have five minutes. We each choose one. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Oh, by the way, this one's mine. ﻿Three seconds. ﻿Two... One... ﻿Time's up. ﻿This one's mine! I'm in here! ﻿Perfect. Just one problem, ﻿none of us has a driver's license. ﻿You worry too much. ﻿I already sent a Favor. -And...? ﻿Here it is. ﻿Here's the Favor gang, the ones responsible for this year's big breakthrough. ﻿Let's hear what they have to say on this festive occasion. ﻿Getting used to it? ﻿I won't say we're aren't enjoying it, ﻿but as I always tell Adam, ﻿when you give it your all you see results. ﻿No news yet, but hey, download us from the App Store and Google Play. ﻿Favor. ﻿Bunch of amateurs. ﻿I'm proud of you, Adam. ﻿Really. ﻿Good luck, I'll wait for you here. ﻿Any weapons? -No. ﻿Everything okay? -Fine. -Okay. ﻿Who are you here to visit? ﻿Visit? Nobody, I... ﻿My dad works here. ﻿He's a guard, I'm waiting for him ﻿because I forgot my house key. ﻿Why wait here like some prisoner's kid? ﻿I'll call him. Which cellblock? -No, no, it's all right. ﻿Thanks. I'll wait here. ﻿Is Adam here yet? -Not yet, Dima. ﻿If a guard stops him at the gate, I'll break his face. ﻿Don't touch anyone unless I say so. ﻿Sorry, Rafi, your son didn't show. ﻿I'm very sorry. ﻿Here. ﻿No bacteria. ﻿It's "bacteria," stupid-head. ﻿So? How was it? -Fine. ﻿Did you talk it all out? We talked it all out. ﻿And... ﻿And I came up with a great idea for a new Favor feature. ﻿That's what you had on your mind? A new feature? ﻿No, afterwards. It's a great idea. ﻿I'll tell you in the car. ﻿If you haven't heard about Favor, ﻿you must not have been on earth for the past week. ﻿How did three 12th-graders climb to the top of the cellular industry? ﻿I think we can run with this version ﻿until we hit ten million users, max. ﻿At this rate well hit ten million within a week. ﻿We either update the version to fix bugs ﻿or work on a new alpha version. We can't do both. ﻿We don't have 200 programmers. I'm still working on 128 Giga. ﻿So where do we stand? ﻿In place, if we're lucky. ﻿If we don't improve the code it won't last much longer. ﻿That's just what Gvili wants, for us to get stuck, ﻿realize it's too big for us and sell him Favor. ﻿If that's his plan, it's working. ﻿No way. We built Favor from scratch, without Element. ﻿We're not crawling to him when things get a little rough. ﻿A million shekels each isn't crawling. ﻿Listen here, ﻿there'll be hard times ﻿but one thing won't change. ﻿The data on this USB stick is worth millions. Millions. ﻿Instead of selling out cheap, let's face the problems. ﻿Your visit with your dad changed you, huh? ﻿That has nothing to do with it. ﻿So what do we tell Gvili? ﻿The numbers are skyrocketing, Favor's traffic is too, ﻿a quarter-million new users every day, ﻿things couldn't be better. ﻿That's only part of the picture, Adam. ﻿Not true. Gvili, ﻿we have... -What you have is a beta version. ﻿You're halfway there. ﻿I admire your ability to grow Favor, ﻿but you've reached your limit. ﻿A version that can carry its own weight ﻿will need a programming division, a tech division, operations team running 24/7, ﻿it's a job for 100 people at least. ﻿Sell me Favor, friends, ﻿take a million shekels each ﻿and work for me for very high salaries, ﻿Head of Design, Head of R Manager. ﻿Yes, Mr. Edri? ﻿Good afternoon. About the new film, "Element Inside," ﻿write me down for two million. ﻿Let's go for it. -I agree. ﻿Me, too. -Fine, ﻿I'm waiting for your message. I have a lot invested in this. ﻿Great. Bye. ﻿Well? Have you decided? -We've decided. ﻿Mr. Gvili, Favor is yours. ﻿For ten million shekels. ﻿What? -What? ﻿I think I misheard you. -Ten million. ﻿It's worth it. ﻿Maybe some pool water got in my ear ﻿because I just heard a ridiculous number. ﻿A million shekels plus a senior position at Element for each of you. ﻿That's my offer. ﻿Feel free to discuss it on your way out. ﻿If you plan to keep making faces ﻿I can go. ﻿You can go, we'll manage without you. ﻿Here, look. ﻿Pita, tell me about your weight problem. ﻿"Pita, you lard-ass, ﻿"you fridge on two legs, ﻿turn around and show us your face. ﻿"Is that your face ora lunar eclipse?" ﻿See? ﻿We don't even need you for the only thing you're good at. ﻿Friends, I left the vacuum cleaner in the computer room. ﻿Can one of you open the door for me? ﻿Pita, I'll count it as a workout. ﻿No need to stay, Mr. Pita, I have some more cleaning to do here. ﻿The room needs airing out. ﻿Okay, but... ﻿make it quick. ﻿Hola. ﻿Where's my captain? ﻿Did they open a water park without telling me? ﻿It's a surfboard. Your programmer could use ﻿some aquatic exercise. Want to try? ﻿What's up, Adi? -Hey. ﻿He went to open the computer room for Yosef. ﻿That doofus left his vacuum cleaner there. ﻿Should he be there alone? ﻿It's okay, Pita's with him. ﻿What's up? ﻿Yosef? ﻿Good God, you startled me, miss. ﻿What are you doing there? -Cleaning under the desk. ﻿Pardon my saying so, ﻿but maybe Mr. Pita should stop hiding peanuts in his pocket. ﻿It all falls under the desk. ﻿Don't bother cleaning it up, ﻿Pita will eat it eventually. ﻿Good God! -What? ﻿A goober! ﻿Well? -Poor guy, he's on all fours ﻿hunting for goobers. ﻿I swear they aren't mine. ﻿Isn't Pita here yet? ﻿"Circuit training in the park." He'll be here soon. ﻿Can you stop that noise? ﻿This noise is passive income, darling. ﻿I like it. ﻿I understand, but... ﻿you're not the only one here, ﻿we're a team, and you don't like to pass the ball. ﻿She's no trainer, ﻿she's an assassin from Belarus. ﻿Relax, circuit training never killed anyone. ﻿Over 1,500 people in the US alone ﻿died last year working out. ﻿None of my clients ever died during a session. ﻿And a minute later? ﻿Did you fall, or are you looking for scraps? ﻿Hey. ﻿You're pathetic. -You're right. ﻿I really shouldn't pamper only the pretty ones. ﻿What's the connection? -My circumsection. ﻿Drinks all around. ﻿And a diet for my buddy here. ﻿Happy now? ﻿Adam, you're out of line. ﻿Now you're on my case, too? ﻿I'm not on your case. ﻿I just don't think you should show off your money. ﻿Funny, I didn't hear you say that ﻿when Gvili put us on a chopper so we could eat. ﻿He was showing off, not us. ﻿Whoa! ﻿Surprised smiley! ﻿Smiley living in La-La Land. ﻿What a gold digger, huh? ﻿She won't stop digging until she strikes gold. ﻿Hadar gave me a great idea. ﻿This I gotta hear. ﻿An awesome pool party at the villa ﻿for all the kids from school. ﻿Are you for real? -Most kids there are cool, ﻿they should have some fun. ﻿Why not treat our friends? ﻿What about all the assholes who hated you all those years? ﻿Who ignored you? Who tortured Pita? ﻿The nice kids will never forget it. ﻿Neither will the assholes. ﻿Ready to fly with me? ﻿You can count on me ﻿And if there's a problem, speak up, I'm here ﻿You can count on me ﻿And if you need a favorJ I'll be right there ﻿Nobody knows you better than I do ﻿Nobody knows you better ﻿And if you need me you can always call me ﻿So if you're feeling good ﻿Talk to me, bro ﻿We'll fly up to the sky Come along with me ﻿find if you start to fizzle We'll put you on a NASA missile ﻿We're all friends here ﻿So if you're feeling good ﻿And if you're bummed ﻿So if you're feeling good ﻿And if you're bummed ﻿You can count on me ﻿You don't need to talk too much ﻿I understand ﻿Everything's all right I'll be there in two and we'll work it out ﻿Nobody knows you better than I do And if you need me you can always call me ﻿It's now or never ﻿They haven't forgotten where they came from ﻿We grew up on the street and dreamed of the good life ﻿No time for anything new ﻿It’s either friends or cash ﻿I'll take both ﻿I'll take care of all the shit in between ﻿Don't bum out do me a favor ﻿A shared sorrow is easier to bear ﻿You've got it made in the shade ﻿If you've got the punch then serve the whole bunch ﻿We came up together so what's mine is yours ﻿You may've left the 'hood but it's still in your blood ﻿So if you're feeling good Talk to me, bro ﻿We'll fly up to the sky Come along with me ﻿An i you start to izze We'll put you on a NASA missile ﻿We're all friends here ﻿So if you're feeling good Talk to me, bro ﻿We'll fly up to the sky Come along with me ﻿And if you start to fizzle We'll put you on a NASA missile ﻿We're all friends here ﻿So if you're feeling good ﻿And if you're bummed ﻿So if you're feeling good ﻿We're all friends here... ﻿Adam... ﻿Adam, did you buy more milk? -Good morning, Noa. ﻿It's Noa, right? ﻿Oops... ﻿Sorry, it's Shahar, right? ﻿I always get names wrong, sorry, embarrassed smiley! ﻿Smiley brushing teeth with Adam's toothbrush? ﻿Tooth decay is a killer, you know. ﻿So is brain damage. -Excuse me? ﻿Keep on brushing. ﻿4 out of 5 dentists recommend it, ﻿but the 5th lives in India so he doesn't count. ﻿Tell me... ﻿Honestly, ﻿do you think I'm mature enough for a monogamous relationship? ﻿I think you're one stage past mature. ﻿What do they call that again? ﻿Overripe. ﻿You're hilarious, Noa. ﻿Good morning. ﻿Did you sleep well? ﻿Spare me the questions. ﻿Woke up on the wrong side of the bed? ﻿Smiley smiling sarcastically. ﻿Smiley don't give a damn. ﻿Chillax. -You chillax. ﻿What's with the protective aunt act? ﻿Want a protective aunt? Here. ﻿The problem with Hadar isn't that she's a dumb slut, ﻿it's that she sees you as a walking wallet. ﻿I don't trust her. There, I said it. ﻿If you can't see it, you must be as dumb as her. ﻿And you're a genius, Shahar, ﻿smarter than anyone else. ﻿Not anyone else, just everyone here. ﻿Is that so? ﻿Well, if you're so smart, ﻿you'd realize I never even saw my dad, ﻿I waited at the gate for half an hour and went back to the taxi. ﻿What? I don't believe it. ﻿How else could I get you off my back? ﻿Good morning! -Not now, Pita. ﻿I just... -We're in the middle. ﻿What's the matter? -Butt out! ﻿But... -You get off my back, too. ﻿All in all it's been a wonderful morning. ﻿What a treat. ﻿Shahar! Adam! ﻿What are you shouting about? ﻿Did you touch my computer? ﻿No, why? -Did Adam? ﻿I don't know any Adam. What's the matter? ﻿Why are you shouting like someone stole your croissant? ﻿Nobody's downloading Favor. ﻿I'll check the administrator for last night's downloads. ﻿Zero. ﻿Absolute zero. ﻿Not only did he grope stupid smiley, ﻿he lied about visiting his dad. ﻿Zero downloads in 11 hours. ﻿What? -Must be a malfunction. Let's calm down. Wow, what brilliant advice. Who's it from, Hadar? ﻿Shahar, you know something? ﻿I've had it with you. ﻿I've had it with... -Shit! ﻿Shit! Shit! ﻿What's going on? ﻿Our computer's been taken over. ﻿You have mail. ﻿My email works but there's nothing there. ﻿You have mail. ﻿Mine too. -Then what are they talking about? ﻿You have mail. ﻿You have mail. ﻿Yosef, did you bring in the mail today? ﻿Yes, a few things came in. ﻿I've never seen anyone so excited ﻿about reading exterminators' brochures. -Where are they? ﻿They usually come in through the sewers... ﻿Not the cockroaches, the stuff you brought from the mailbox. ﻿It's all here. ﻿Here it is. ﻿"Favor is on vacation until further notice. ﻿Come to Pier 3 at the marina tomorrow at 2:00 ﻿"with the beta version of the app on a USB stick. ﻿"In return you'll receive a suitcase containing 3 million shekels. ﻿"Thinking of calling the police? ﻿"Well publicize your list of customers and favors. ﻿"Without anonymity you're nothing. See you at the beach. ﻿"P.S. No cell phones." ﻿So it's not an exterminator, huh? ﻿I've seen creeps, I've seen charlatans, ﻿I've even seen crime syndicates, ﻿but a ransom note like this so early on? ﻿That's new. ﻿Who could it be? ﻿I don't know, but they stole the lists ﻿of all your users. ﻿And what they used it for. ﻿Without anonymity you aren't worth much. ﻿It says that in the letter, too. ﻿Just don't call the police. ﻿I can rebuild the whole thing. ﻿It's all in my head. ﻿The problem is, if the media get wind of this ﻿the public will see your weakness, ﻿how easily your server can be hacked. ﻿Nobody'll invest a shekel. It'll be curtains for Favor. ﻿That's why we're here. ﻿Now that you're holding a hot potato ﻿you want to pass it to Element? ﻿Bad timing, folks. ﻿A 4 Please don't contact me until this blows over, ﻿if it blows over. ﻿So you're dumping us? ﻿We decided to go with the Kazakh kid. ﻿You can use Element's yacht for the exchange, ﻿I'll make sure it's at Pier 3, ﻿but that's all I can do. ﻿Last chance, Gvili, you have the means. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿How's my bodybuilder? ﻿Hey. ﻿You remember we have a workout, right? ﻿Somebody die? ﻿We got a ransom note for Favor. We need to take a USB stick ﻿with all the data for the app to the marina. ﻿You're kidding. ﻿Seriously? ﻿Wow. -Favor for 3 million shekels. ﻿Weren't you already offered that amount? ﻿Yeah, by Gvili. ﻿Hey, is that... ﻿a coincidence or... ﻿The truth is, Yosefs been acting fishy lately. ﻿He always wants to clean the computer room. ﻿Good thing my dad doesn't know about the app, ﻿he'd be the prime suspect. ﻿What? ﻿Maybe he knows. ﻿Did you tell him? ﻿I can't believe you told a prisoner in jail ﻿for embezzling millions from a hi-tech company ﻿when we have an app that... -Chill, Adam, ﻿he's stuck in jail for the next five years. ﻿Tomorrow at 11 we take Gvili's yacht. ﻿What does it matter if it's on the pier or the yacht? ﻿Use your brain, Pita. ﻿On the pier we're three sitting ducks, ﻿on a yacht with 20 other people we're the Favor summer party. ﻿You've totally lost it. ﻿You call this an occasion to celebrate? ﻿For them it's a party, for us they're witnesses. ﻿They're our guarantee that we'll get the money, ﻿not a bullet in the head. ﻿And endanger dozens of other people? ﻿-Why? ﻿I think it's brilliant. ﻿I wish you'd come. ﻿Come to think of it, ﻿maybe someone should stay here ﻿to make sure Yosef doesn't board that yacht. ﻿Mr. Pita! ﻿You startled me. ﻿A thousand pardons, I had no intention. ﻿I haven't seen you so startled since that meal ﻿when you discovered the main course ﻿was granola. ﻿No. ﻿First the money. ﻿At the same time? ﻿On three. ﻿One... two... ﻿three. ﻿It's a trick! Pita, grab the box! ﻿Into the water, now! ﻿You can't have it! ﻿Leave me alone! ﻿Give it here, fatso! ﻿You can't have it! ﻿Rhinoceros! ﻿Adam, jump! ﻿Give it already! ﻿Grab it! -Come on, Pita! ﻿Hand it over! -Pita, throw us the drive and jump! ﻿Beat it! ﻿The neighbors complained about the noise. Party over! ﻿Next stop - Cyprus! ﻿I'm dying! -This looks like the end! ﻿Help, my sweet Lord! ﻿If I survive this I'll keep the Sabbath. ﻿If I survive this I'll join a nunnery. ﻿Stay low. ﻿What about Pita? We can't help him from here. ﻿Stay low. -I'm trying. We have to free Pita. ﻿Favor and Pita. ﻿Adam, we don't know how to help him. ﻿I know someone who knows. ﻿You again? What did you forget this time? ﻿Your sandwich? ﻿My pita. ﻿Is he your father? ﻿What father? ﻿He's my father. ﻿Adam? ﻿What an honor, Mr. Adam! ﻿Adam's here! ﻿I know my son, Dima. ﻿Take Igor and get our backgammon winnings. ﻿I'll just leave you a pack of wipes. ﻿Thanks, Igor. ﻿Move it. ﻿Dasvidanya Goodbye. ﻿Dasvidanya. ﻿You must be Shahar. ﻿Sorry we have to meet in a place like this. ﻿It's all right. ﻿Adam, I've dreamed so many times ﻿of you sitting here in front of me. ﻿I have a problem. I need your help. ﻿How can I help you, kid? ﻿You know about our app. ﻿Do I know? ﻿All the guards here have it. ﻿They're all busy staring at Favor. ﻿ e got a 3-million-shekel ransom note for the app ﻿and when we came to make the exchange they kidnapped our programmer. ﻿They kidnapped someone for 3 million shekels? ﻿Tell me you aren't involved, Rafi. ﻿Do you really think I'd do something to hurt you? ﻿As if you didn't make me leave school and hide from everybody 5 years ago. ﻿I realize you're mad at me, ﻿but not as much as I'm mad at myself. ﻿I lost my son, ﻿my only child, ﻿and nobody can give me back those years without you. ﻿Any idea who could be behind this? ﻿Ever heard of Avner Gvili? ﻿Gvili? ﻿He's a real scumbag. ﻿I knew it. ﻿But he stays within the law, ﻿a lawyer who rubs elbows with Knesset members and lobbyists. ﻿see you know him well. ﻿To kidnap an 18-year-old ﻿you'd have to be an asshole and stupid, ﻿and Avner Gvili isn't stupid. ﻿It's our only lead. ﻿I'll sniff around and get back to you within a few hours. ﻿Thanks, Rafi. ﻿You don't have to visit me, ﻿but I really wish you would. ﻿A, I can't see C. ﻿This damn mask! ﻿I'm taking off this stupid mask. ﻿I got a thread stuck in my... ﻿Cut it out! ﻿Start the engine. Change of plans. ﻿What do you want from me? ﻿How shall we explain? A song, perhaps? ﻿A Powerpoint presentation? ﻿Powerpoint... ﻿Me like. ﻿I'm calling the police. ﻿Don't you see what this means? ﻿The yacht is getting away, ﻿we're losing him. -We have the USB stick. ﻿It's not Pita they want, ﻿it's this. ﻿Do you want to wait and see if you're right ﻿or do you want to do something? ﻿Like what? ﻿Talk to Gvili? ﻿Even my scumbag dad says he's a scumbag. ﻿Or shall we call the jail again? ﻿Or why not call Yosef? ﻿You thought he was cleaning the room ﻿when he was cleaning us out right beneath our noses. ﻿So nobody can help us? ﻿What's up? ﻿I saw the door was open. ﻿Where's Pita? ﻿The exchange went wrong. They kidnapped him. -What? ﻿They've got him now. ﻿What about the USB stick? ﻿I have it. ﻿I want to call the police. -Bad idea. ﻿We don't want to pressure them. ﻿Especially when we don't know who's behind this. ﻿So everyone's a suspect, everyone's against us, ﻿you can't trust anyone, ﻿not me, not your dad. ﻿Only Hadar. ﻿Hold on, do you think... -Yes, I think. ﻿Do you even know anything about sneaky smiley? ﻿Background, friends, anything? ﻿Because she knows everything about you and Favor. ﻿She follows you like a shadow, she eavesdrops on your calls, ﻿on our meetings with Gvili... ﻿She even uses your toothbrush. ﻿Will you relax? ﻿They have Pita, we have the data. ﻿We just have to make an exchange. ﻿"Good morning, Superman"? -What's that? ﻿Where'd this sandwich come from? -I made it for him yesterday. ﻿Shit, shit, shit! ﻿He accidentally threw us the wrong box. ﻿"Accidentally." ﻿So the kidnappers have Pita and the USB stick. ﻿At least they don't know it. ﻿I need to eat, I haven't eaten anything in an hour. ﻿Give him something to stuff his mouth with. ﻿There's a box with a sandwich in my bag. ﻿What box? -I could use a bite of something. ﻿Stealing a kid's sandwich is like robbing an old lady. We did that yesterday. -Oh yeah. ﻿Let's see the sandwich. ﻿Check it out, a Spiderman lunchbox. ﻿It's Superman, not Spiderman. ﻿Your sister is Superman. ﻿The douchebag with the red head is Spiderman. ﻿Spiderman. ﻿Don't open the box! ﻿Say what? ﻿This baguette thinks he can order us around. ﻿I got the boxes mixed up, ﻿that one has a salami sandwich from last week. ﻿A hunk of nauseating rotten meat. ﻿You know what a week in the sun can do to salami? ﻿There goes my appetite... ﻿Do you have to spin your wheels? ﻿It helps me concentrate. We each have our own way. ﻿You buy drinks all around, ﻿I spin my skateboard wheels. ﻿Enjoy. ﻿It's been 4 hours, they could be anywhere. ﻿Hey, is he wearing the Mi band? ﻿Is that all you care about, ﻿how many calories you burn when you're tied up in a yacht? ﻿Be quiet, she's right. ﻿The band has a built-in GPS. ﻿I can trace him. ﻿Got it! ﻿You stay put, I'll go get him. ﻿It's encoded. Can you hack it? ﻿You think? I'm in Arts, not Computer Science. ﻿Besides, all that code stuff ﻿is for geeks. ﻿Who's that? ﻿No idea. ﻿Turn on the front door light. ﻿Halt, the place is surrounded by cops! ﻿Can't tell who it is with the hood on. ﻿Turn on the living room TV. ﻿He's coming this way. What'll we do? ﻿Turn on the kettle, he'll think we're in the kitchen. ﻿Where to? ﻿Adam, get your foot off me ﻿or I'll arrest you for stepping on a police officer! ﻿Yosef? ﻿Sgt. Yossi Ezra, Police ID No. 405117. ﻿But what...? ﻿I spent two weeks in England once. ﻿I went to a United game with my wife. ﻿I'm also a detective with the Cyber Squad. ﻿You're, like, an undercover cop? ﻿Not just "like." I hunt creeps who use ransomware. ﻿But why here? ﻿We suspect that Element is involved in ransomware crimes. ﻿This was before Favor even existed. ﻿So I decided to cozy up with Gvili and try to collect evidence. ﻿I knew Gvili was behind those ransom demands, ﻿that piece of shit. -We have nothing on him. ﻿Apart from the fact that he really is a piece of shit. ﻿He didn't even pay for my transportation, ﻿that jerk. ﻿As the Duchess of Windsor once said, ﻿you little motherfuckers. ﻿Unidentified caller. ﻿Do you owe property tax? ﻿No. -Then answer and put it on speaker. ﻿Hello? ﻿Hello, I'm calling from Rimonim Prison, ﻿Will you accept a collect call from Rafi Ben-Artzi? ﻿I will. ﻿Go ahead. Adam? -Yes, Rafi? ﻿There's an echo. Am I on the speaker? ﻿Yes, I'm with Shahar and Sgt. Yossi Ezra. ﻿Sgt. Ezra! ﻿Still playing hide-and-seek with hackers, Ezra? ﻿Still stuck in a cell with five other prisoners, Rafi? I'd love to continue this pleasent chat ﻿but I have something urgent to tell my son. ﻿I'm listening. ﻿I have some inside information. ﻿Gvili and Element have nothing to do with all this. ﻿The person behind this plot ﻿was a cryptography expert in Silicon Valley ﻿who ended up on the FBI's most wanted list ﻿The last alias she used was Mattias, ﻿Adi Mattias. ﻿When I make you a healthy sandwich, I expect you to eat it. ﻿Where's the USB stick? ﻿I don't know what you're talking about. ﻿Where's the Favor data, fatso? ﻿I won't ask you again. ﻿I can't believe you're doing this to me. ﻿This is your last chance. ﻿I'm impressed, Pita honey. ﻿I've never seen you run like this. ﻿Did you lose a few grams? ﻿How much do you weigh, anyway? ﻿I have no idea. ﻿But add another 128 Giga! ﻿What're you gonna do? Give up on a USB stick worth millions? ﻿You'll have to crap it out sometime. ﻿I'll be there to clean up after you. ﻿What are you hiding here? ﻿Juice! ﻿Prune juice. What a surprise! This could help, eh, Pita honey? ﻿I'm only allowed to drink diet. ﻿Don't worry, I won't tell. ﻿Is it far? ﻿A quarter-mile. ﻿You have one minute to crap out the USB stick. ﻿My bowel movements aren't a walk in the park ﻿You can't hurry them. ﻿Wrong answer, Pita honey, ﻿and your time is up. ﻿Keep your mouth shut and your butt open. ﻿Open up, Pita, open up. ﻿Take cover and stay out of trouble, you hear? ﻿I'm going to direct the troops. ﻿Shahar, I have something important to tell you. ﻿In case one of us doesn't make it out of here. ﻿Not now, or neither of us will make it alive. ﻿You have one minute to crap out the USB stick. ﻿I swear, any tricks and it's gonna hurt, ﻿and hurt bad. ﻿Do you copy? ﻿All units to the entrance and wait for my signal. ﻿Chopper, you stay and cover us. ﻿Did you hearthat? ﻿I'm not exactly in a listening mood. ﻿Don't budge. ﻿Adi Mattias, drop your gun and come out with your hands up! ﻿The building is surrounded. ﻿I liked you better as a trainer. ﻿Shut your trap. ﻿I still have you and it seems you're worth something. ﻿Adi, I'm warning you. ﻿Warning me? About what, exactly? ﻿You don't know what I've been through. ﻿You'll have plenty of time to tell us. ﻿Just wondering... ﻿do you have the USB stick? ﻿Pita, are you done yet? ﻿Don't forget not to flush. ﻿I can't believe I just said that. ﻿Shall we Favor a plumber? ﻿I've never seen anyone so grossed out ﻿about taking 100 million shekels out of a toilet. ﻿I want another 10% for this. ﻿Favor's Cinderella story comes to a fairytale climax. ﻿This afternoon it seemed like the app was history, ﻿traffic had stopped, the investors pulled out, ﻿but just 3 hours since Adi Mattias' arrest ﻿Favor is back in the game with over 28 million users. ﻿We'd been hunting for the ransomware culprit for ages. ﻿Hey, don't spill that, this isn't your house. ﻿That's what I like about C++, ﻿the algorithmic code sits modularly ﻿over a server with an inverted soundcard. ﻿I love the way you think. ﻿It all depends whether the hardware can handle the server. ﻿You still owe me a favor, remember? ﻿I made a few calls. We're on it. ﻿Didn't see that coming, huh? ﻿Shocked smiley. ﻿Adam, there's someone at the door for you. ﻿Good evening. ﻿Adam? ﻿Make it quick, Rafi. ﻿We're doing you a favor here. ﻿Adam. ﻿Dad? ﻿Yes, it's me, Dad. ﻿I wanted to tell you something but I didn't get a chance. ﻿I've been in jail for a few years now ﻿and I just realized why I'm in jail. ﻿I'm in jail because I'm a lousy dad. ﻿I didn't think about our family, I didn't think about you, ﻿and it hurts to know that... ﻿you're paying for my mistake. ﻿I plan to spend the rest of my time in prison ﻿making up forthat. ﻿Not for my sake, for yours. ﻿Because you deserve a real father, and... ﻿that's all I have to say. ﻿Wait. ﻿Dad, I... ﻿Are you okay? ﻿Yeah. ﻿I just remembered, what were you saying before? ﻿Remember an hour and a half ago ﻿I said that when life smiles at you, punch it in the face? ﻿That's exactly what I did. ﻿I punched my fear of changing. ﻿This. ﻿two weeks after this sweet kiss ﻿we decided it wouldn't hurt to swallow our pride ﻿and work with Gvili, ﻿and that's exactly what happened. ﻿You won't believe how much we paid for Element.
