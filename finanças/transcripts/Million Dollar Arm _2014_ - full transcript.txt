What is that, son? Million Dollar Arm. You don't play cricket. It's a contest. One million US dollars. This is for kids. You have work to do. Real work. Calling all cricket players! Come and be a contestant in the "Million Dollar Arm" contest. Coach? What is it, Rinku? We're all track and field, not cricket players. Just because they are calling for cricket players doesn't mean you can't try out. I want to sign up, Coach. So then sign up. I'm not your secretary, Rinku. If I won a million dollars, I bet you would be. You make a funny joke. Everyone! 10 laps! Courtesy of Mr. Singh. You used to go to the academy, didn't you? Yeah. Why did you leave? My father hurt his back. I had to help drive his truck. Do you miss it? You ask a lot of questions! I'm trying to practice. Ok, ok. Sorry. Yeah, I miss it. Did you play cricket? No. I hate cricket. I played field hockey. I throw the javelin. I hate cricket, too. And I suck at it. I'm Rinku. I'm Dinesh. If you win, what are you going to do with the money? I'm gonna buy my father a new truck. I understand. You should get him a driver, too. Maybe I will. Dad, do you like it? Do they know you don't play cricket? They know. It doesn't matter, the contest is over. It's nice... ...but I don't need a new truck. Dad... I have to go to America. I know you will make me proud. He wants to watch cricket with you. This is his house? Is she his servant? She must be. JB likes to hustle. What is this? I think it's used to keep our bowling hand warm. Spencer is a funny name. Are you from Mars or what? That's a pizza. You eat it. I've fallen in love with pizza. We're screwed. JB is going to pack our bags and send us home. Dinesh, don't worry so. We can't master it in one day. Don't you miss home? I do miss it. But now we are in America. We can do anything here. You can even change your name to... Spencer. I don't want to change my name. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Where are you going? I'm going to the bathroom. Don't worry, I'm not leaving you. He's not staying to watch us today? I guess not. I'm tired, I'm hungry and JB is late. Pizza again? He's killing me. I don't care. I like pizza. Yes, Rinku, the new phone is working. Are you listening to Mr. Bernstein? Yes, JB is a very nice man, and he is taking good care of us. Everyone is thinking of you. We are all so excited. I think of you a lot. I miss you. I have to go to work. We have practice tomorrow. Should we leave now? I think I ate too much. I told you not to! You're eating cow, lamb, pig and who knows what else. I'm bored. I eat when I'm bored. At least we get to see our families soon, right?
