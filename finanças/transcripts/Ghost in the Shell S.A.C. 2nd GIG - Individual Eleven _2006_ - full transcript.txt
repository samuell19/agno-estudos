23 minutes ago, a heavily armed criminal group. . . . . .occupied the Chinese embassy, Located on the 46th floor of this building. It's still unclear at this point how many hostages there are. . . . . .but it's been confirmed that at Least ten workers were still there. Likewise, the number of terrorists in the group is unknown. While it's doubtful that it refers to the number of members. . . . . . they called themselves ''The Individual Eleven''. . . . . .in their claim of responsibility. A standoff inside an embassy, huh? This means the indefinite standby order on Section 9 might be lifted, doesn't it? So, what are these Individual Eleven people demanding? An immediate halt to the intake of Asian refugees, as well as the total closure. . . . . .of the five refugee residential districts located around the country. Okay, now I get it. The Chinese government's been sending regular flights to Dejima. . . . . . to divert the masses of recently declared Asian refugees. Guess they got caught in the crossfire. Ishikawa, how's it coming? I've put taps on all the equipment in the facility. What kind of setup are the local cops using? It looks like they're running a wide-area jammer along with a press blackout. All the cameras in the embassy were destroyed. They're negotiating with the cops via a phone line without a video feed. Okay, once you've put a tap on that, come back to the unmarked van. Roger. Saito! I've reached my designated point. There are image curtains over the windows so I can't verify the situation inside. I'm giving top priority to neutralizing the curtains. Good. Everyone else, be ready for the raid and stand by. We'll wait for orders from the chief. You're starting the paperwork now? Do you truly think that we have that much time? I'm sorry, but please remain on standby until we have all the paperwork ready. Prime Minister. In that case, why not consider this? We will carry out our mission in secret under the cover of the police operation. Admittedly, it will be necessary for you to gather paperwork. . . . . .that can provide post-facto legitimacy. If you still have misgivings. . . . . .feel free to say that all of Public Security Section 9's actions from this point on. . . . . .were carried out under my sole authority. Thus, if we fail to neutralize the terrorists, any problems would be solved. . . . . . by putting myself alone on trial. Even if public opinion should question the government's responsibility. . . . . .you could claim that no one in your administration knew of my actions. Am I right? The rumors are true, I see. You're a shrewd man. All right people, you heard the man. We have a maximum of 1 0 minutes for this operation. There's not much time before the SWAT team comes in. Think of it as proof of the chief's faith in us. And the team selection? Go in two-man cells. Batou with Togusa, Paz with Saito. Use a different route than the SWAT team. Roger. Just stand there. Screw this, we're going in now! Major! They came in early! We are the Individual Eleven. Even if we should fall here, other individual egos will carry on our will. For that reason, death holds no meaning for us! Oh, you don't say? Then go ahead and die. Outside the window! Presented by BiG-GuY Fansubbing I truly appreciate your fine work in this incident. I will accept your budget proposal in its entirety. . . . . .and authorize you to rebuild and run your unit. Here are the papers. Thank you, Madam Prime Minister. And are you the unit commander who led the assault? You didn't make a single sarcastic remark back there. That's not like you, Chief. ls it because she's a woman? She isn't the one that l should tear into. Besides, I've never heard of anyone developing stomach trouble. . . . . .from swallowing their pride. But don't you think a boss like her will be trouble? She's the type who will insist on keeping a leash on her pet dog. I can't help but think that the assault order. . . . . .was the result of her skillfully pulling you to resolve the situation. . . . . .while avoiding taking responsibility. She doesn't seem to be a mere puppet put in place. . . . . . by the ruling coalition, I admit. For now, we should graciously celebrate. . . . . .the rebuilding of Section 9, don't you think? You're right. Niihama Refugee Residential District Sealed Sector All units, target building confirmed. Operation code I-S. I repeat, operation code I-S. Attention all units. Armed refugees are in possession of a think-tank. Exercise caution. I repeat, refugees are in possession of a think-tank. Exercise caution. J1, provide backup for mechanized squad as per code I-S. Destroy target on sight. I repeat, destroy target on sight. Roger that. These may be training exercises. . . . . . but I gotta blow away the real thing at least once. . . J1, your heart rate is exceeding normal levels. Is there a problem? No, I'm all right. There's no. . . problem. Target confirmed ! Enemy has missile lock. Son of a. . . J1, your heart rate is exceeding normal levels. Are you all right?! Shut up, damn it! These may be dummy rounds. . . . . . but who could stay calm with that damn alarm going off?! Your ass is- J1, what's wrong? Your heartbeat has stopped. Attention, all units. We have an emergency. This is not a drill. The J-1 pilot seems to have died inside his cockpit, cause unknown. As a safety precaution, we are Lifting code I-S. Initiate withdrawal action as per code S-A. HA-01 AV has not stood down from code I-S. Pilot's life support signals are still all-green. We're detecting cardiac arrest. . . . . . but the A. I. seems to be ignoring orders. . . . . .because the pilot's cyberbrain is still active. It is classifying the withdrawal order as an external attack, and is giving. . . - . . . top priority to protecting the pilot. - Hey! The Jigabachis! Defense Agency Kubota! Aramaki. . . This matter demands immediate attention, I'd say. If there's the slightest chance of a criminal act, you can't help. . . . . . but stick your nose into things, can you? Don't disclose anything that I just told you. Just being seen with you like this would cause a big stink. If you'll excuse me. Mr. Aramaki of Section 9, l presume? Cabinet intelligence Service. . . . . .Strategic influence investigation Commission. Representative Aide, Hitori Gohda. . . Kazundo Gohda. I rarely meet anyone who is able to read it properly. Although, personally, l don't think it's that strange of a name. However, I now find it to be an excellent name. Once I tell them how it's pronounced, it tends to stay in people's memory. Especially in combination with this face. So, is there something that I can do. . . . . .for this Cabinet intelligence Service of yours? Yes. We would like the assistance of Section 9. . . . . . in this incident that's currently underway. Although I felt it might be presumptuous, l came in person to meet you. As you might have guessed. . . . . . I would appreciate it if you considered this a direct order. . . . . .from the Chief Cabinet Secretary. After all, with the Prime Minister's skills at crisis management. . . . . .we can hardly expect to get a quick decision out of her. I guess the JGSDA doesn't pay its pilots very well. Chief?! What's going on? Why did you personally come out to the scene? Allow me to explain, Major. This is an agent with the Cabinet intelligence Service. Gohda, Strategic influence investigation Commission. I'll get straight to the point. Full on-scene command authority is hereby transferred to Section 9. . . . . .with the aim of resolving this situation. However, I want you to carry out the operation according to his instructions. Old man, are you serious?! We didn't stick with Section 9 just to become the government's lap dogs. According to our calculations. . . . . .the first helicopter will crash into the refugee district in 48 minutes. Once that happens, there is no turning back. This is already a clear-cut case of terrorism. What will you do about it? All right, we'll hear you out. What's your plan? I'm glad you see things my way. Major, even if we assume that we can believe everything that guy says. . . . . .Why'd you agree to this? Even if we assume that the pilot death and runaway A.I. weren't terrorism. . . . . .if that thing crashes, it's going to cause a certain amount of damage to the area. When that happens, the refugee situation could turn into a powder keg. Besides, without his information, we wouldn't have had any cards to play. My point is, I've gotta know where we stand on. . . Aw, forget it. Saito, you ready? I'm ready. Good. Okay, here we go! Here they come! Don't drop down to the surface. You won't be able to evade their air-to-surface missiles if they get a lock. I don't like these odds. It's two-on-one, and they've already got the edge in firepower. Good, it's just like he said. Batou, the target craft is tailing me. He's all yours! Target acquired. Major, get the target to lift its chin for a second. . . . . .when it passes in front of me. I want to put a round through the canopy from the side to take out the pilot. . . - . . .without destroying the A.I. - Understood ! Tachikoma! It accepted the code rescind order from Control, huh? I'm glad our predictions proved correct. We believed that if the signal from the dead pilot's cyberbrain were cut off. . . . . .the support A. I. would accept the code from Control. Also, my judgment was correct in coming to you for help in this incident. Thanks to you, the Self-Defense officials don't have to bear the disgrace. . . . . .of killing one of their own, you see. So what're you saying? It doesn't bother you at all to have Saito do it?! Batou. It's okay, I'm used to it. Good work, everyone. Reports say that all 1 1 units are confirmed as having returned to base. Have you heard the report from Togusa? No. He says that they found heart medication in the pilot's home. I guess he'd been hiding his condition from his superiors. So are you saying that this wasn't terrorism as Gohda suggested. . . . . . but rather one big accident? I'm not sure. There's no way to be sure without doing a structural analysis. . . . . .on both the medicine they found and the dead pilot's blood. The Cabinet intelligence Service turns up. . . . . .with timing that suggests that they knew everything. . . And JGSDA helicopters circle over the heads of the refugees. . . . . . unnecessarily rubbing them the wrong way. . . . . .as if that were their intent all along. . . What does it all mean, l wonder? It might be that some crime on a massive scale is starting to unfold. . . . . .somewhere we can't see. Kagoshima Prefecture War Dead Memorial Tower ls this everyone? Did you get the message from the helicopter too? Yeah. I have done all I can for the cause. Let's go. Manage to dig up anything on him? I'm not making much progress. The intelligence Agency is the newest administrative organization, after all. Their protection's tougher than I thought. And as far as the dead pilot goes. . . . . . I can't find anything to contradict their story that he was hiding a heart condition. Looks like this is going to be written off as an accident. Yeah. . . What about the personal history of this ''Gohda'' person? He was part of the group headhunted from the Defense Policy Bureau. He quickly rose to his current position. But his record at the time was nothing special. He was more like an outcast. To tell you the truth, the man's an enigma. What's that? It's what Gohda looked like when he was in the DPB. He was apparently injured in some kind of accident. . . . . . but he's keeping the wounds as they are. Leaves less of an impression than now. Major! Assemble the team immediately! Has something happened? Something unexpected. The CIS backroom dealings can wait until later. Understood. We'll be right there. Hey, are you getting this?! What did they say? Get him on camera! They have swords! Roughly 30 minutes ago. . . - They just chopped off each other's heads! - . . .a group calling itself the individual Eleven. . . - One by one. . . they're killing each other! - . . .committed mass suicide at the top of the Kyushu Broadcast Tower. - These men on the roof seem. . . - They beheaded one another with Japanese swords. - . . . to have killed one another with swords! - They say that 1 1 of the 1 2 died on the spot. So, one killed his buddy and ran off, huh? Yes. For some reason, he decided not to go through with the suicide plan. The fact is, the numerous terrorist acts that followed the helicopter incident. . . . . .were the work of criminal groups. . . . . .all calling themselves the individual Eleven. What's your source for this intel? I received it from the Prime Minister herself. Metropolitan Police Nationwide Serious Crime #104 Each of the crimes in this dossier. . . . . .were carried out by separate groups. . . . . .calling themselves the individual Eleven. Just like the group that attacked the Chinese embassy. . . . . .they see the invited refugees as enemies. . . . . .and are persistently carrying out acts. . . . . .that almost seem designed to incite the refugees to violence. The reason that the police didn't release this information to the media. . . . . .seems to be that they don't want to further agitate the refugees. The misappropriation of refugee aid donations at JNN-TV. The bombing of a refugee aid association. The blackmailing of a non-profit group. . . . . .that provides prosthetic bodies to refugees at no cost. The drowning death of a back-alley prosthetics doctor. A net bank president run over by a train. The stabbing of a Democratic Party member of Parliament. The shooting of Densetsu, the popular cyber-rapper. The threats made against the Nanyou Shinbun Press. And the attempted murder of Prime Minister Kayabuki. . . . . .which came to light only recently. Of these nine crimes, the only one in which the perpetrator was seen. . . . . . is the failed assassination attempt against Prime Minister Kayabuki. Hey, that's. . . Right. He appears to be the same man. . . . . .as the sole survivor we saw in the video just now. That's why she leaked this intel to us? Exactly. We don't have an ID on him, but. . . Even though the Prime Minister's security detail shot the man. . . . . .with dozens of dum-dum bullets when he tried to assassinate her. . . . . . he shrugged it off and fled the scene. He's probably using a special prosthetic body that was designed for military use. An '' immortal prosthetic body ". . . Troops sent out on overseas PKF missions used those. I'll get us started by uncovering this man's identity. What about the Gohda line of inquiry? Continue your investigation into him, Major. There's no sign of a direct link. . . . . . between the CIS and the individual Eleven at the moment. But considering that this string of terrorist acts began. . . . . .the day after the JGSDA helicopters flew over the refugee residential district. . . . . . I suspect that there's a link of some sort. If we keep working the investigation from both angles. . . . . .we'll likely find the point of contact between the two. Yes, sir. About that man who had swapped into a PKF-use prosthetic body. . . Going off of his facial data, he's probably a man by the name of Hideo Kuze. Hideo Kuze? Right. He was definitely in the military. . . . . .when they were dispatched to the peninsula. But he went missing after he shipped out. But with this body model, its product life span is so long. . . . . .that it's impossible to get one domestically or abroad these days. And if you don't get regular maintenance work done. . . . . .you'll have to swap into a different body. If he's still using the same body. . . . . .and hasn't been to any government medical facility. . . . . . it's hard to imagine that he's anybody but Hideo Kuze. What's the matter? Aren't you going to eat? It tastes the same as it did in the old days. The same as the old days, huh. . .? Batou, I've identified the owner of the prosthetic body. Work with Ishikawa to investigate him. Roger. So, this is Poseidon Industrial's Decatoncheir. Tachikoma! Generate a virtual personality from the memory array he's uploaded here. . . . . . to profile his thought processes. Roger! Who are you? I'm Kazundo Gohda. Among other things. . . . . . I was once involved in the molecular engineering robot project at. . . . . .Greater Japan Research and Technology that created radioactive fallout scrubbers. Radioactive fallout scrubbers? He must mean the Japanese Miracle. As an engineer? No, not at all. My brain specializes in linguistic functions. After two great wars, this country. . . . . . has risen to prominence as an economic superpower again. . . . . .thanks to the radioactive scrubber technology. . . . . .for which I acted as a producer. At the time, I thought that I would rise to the upper ranks of men as well. Even though the Japanese Miracle worked. . . . . .as a shield against nuclear weapons. . . . . . it caused a state of affairs that rendered moot the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. . . . . . not to mention the Cold War world order. Then came the massive influx of refugees. . . . . .and the hollowing out of the country's economy. If something wasn't done, the country would fade away and die. . . . . .and I myself would no longer be able to reach the upper echelons of the system. There was a reason why Japan wasn't able. . . . . .to garner a prominent position in post-war society. You couldn't secure a significant position within the system for the same reason. And that's because society didn't place any concrete value. . . . . .on people who are all talk. What this country is seeking right now. . . . . . is the return to a Shangri-La that is built entirely on the backs of outsiders. Even now, those without motive long for it without realizing it. My mission is to produce a hero that will create that for them. Society has the system in place to give birth to the hero. . . . . .that the times cry out for. I am convinced that the man I have become possesses the kind of Ghost. . . . . .that is suitable to be that system. Ever since I had the accident that left me wandering between life and death. . . . . .and my face was transfigured into what you see here. My belief is that I can produce any situation by rewriting the program. Making yourself a hero in the process? I am not interested in such things now. My role is to be that hero's producer. To create an activist who will represent the unmotivated. . . . . .and carry out what they long for, but are unable to put a voice to. So, who is this hero that you say you're producing? Hey, what's the matter? The Decatoncheir's been breached? Contact security. We've got a cyber bandit incursion. It took them longer than I expected. Major! They've spotted our break-in ! Understood. So, is the enemy of this ''hero'' of yours the refugees? You're directing the citizen's thinking by setting up refugees. . . . . .as an imaginary enemy. Am I right? Guiding their thinking is necessary. As is bending the law in order to do that. The ends justify the means. This theory applies equally to terrorists and democratic nations. You're saying that the consensual opinion of our citizens. . . . . . is to get rid of the refugees? Humility is the chief virtue of our populace. - Major! - I heard you. One last thing. What about Public Security Section 9? Section 9? That's a good question. The cycle of hatred based on absence can't be stopped now. I expect that they'll straddle the line between the will of the people. . . . . .and their own sense of justice, gnashing their teeth all the while. Major, you'll be in trouble if you don't log out right now! Out of time, huh? Emergency Refugee Policy Session Ever since the uproar caused by the individual Eleven suicides, I've received. . . . . . reports of refugees from across Japan gathering at Dejima in Nagasaki. . . . . .as a response to the rapid increase in anti-refugee demonstrations. The media have been readily fanning the flames. . . . . .claiming that this is a prelude to an all-out uprising. Do you have anything to say on the matter? I'll admit that I've been getting reports that the escapee arrest rate is going up. . . . . . but linking that with an uprising would probably be premature. Any flow of refugees into Nagasaki would be prevented by the water. That shows a certain lack of understanding of the situation. This month alone, we of the Coast Guard. . . . . . have prevented two suspicious ships and 1 6 boats from docking at Dejima. It's as clear as day that there is a flow of refugees occurring in Nagasaki. So I see. Nevertheless, the police have several other matters that require our attention. Anyway, it's the Defense Agency who's responsible for this situation. They were so eager to expand the military. . . . . .that they fired live ammunition right under the refugees' noses. . . . . .waking the sleeping beast. Debates over such issues are important. . . . . . but what we need now is a consensus among the various government bureaus. Let's adjourn for the moment and take a break. I see that you can't even spare the time to clear your head. Part of the problem is my lack of clout. But everyone is focused on their interests and losing sight of the problem at hand. The refugee issue demands cooperation from all of them, but they. . . Prime Minister, surely this isn't a problem that you must bear all by yourself. I suppose not. . . By the way, have you managed to obtain any concrete information. . . . . . regarding these individual Eleven people? Yes, ma'am. According to my people's investigations, there is a possibility. . . . . .that the individual Eleven, including the man who attacked you. . . . . .were being spurred on by the ideology of a certain person. We believe that his objective was to manipulate the thinking of the populace. . . . . .and rub the feelings of the refugees the wrong way. You're saying that this is what lead to the gathering of refugees at Dejima? Among other things, yes. There seems to be something baffling going on among the refugees. Do you know what a hub cyberbrain is, Prime Minister? I'm afraid not. Major, please explain. Prime Minister, would you mind if I linked directly with you? No, go ahead. Originally, the concept of a hub, or core, didn't exist in the network. But lately, we've been seeing a phenomenon where a host. . . . . .causes isolated consciousnesses on the network to move in a single direction. . . . . .and creates a sort of collective entity by inviting them into his own cyberbrain. Up until now, it was limited to something on the scale of communes. . . . . . that were centered around small religious sects or charismatic artists. But now, someone has appeared among the refugees. . . . . .who has the ability to win them over and get them to stay in his cyberbrain. We believe that this is the cause of the flow of refugees to Nagasaki. Is this a single person? Someone we can think of as their Leader? From a practical standpoint, it's hard to believe that it's a single person. I can't say it unequivocally. . . . . .but I don't think that any one person's cyberbrain is capable of winning over. . . . . . the consciousnesses of 3 million people simultaneously. But if I were asked whether this hub is something like their Leader. . . . . . then I would have to say that it is. I see. The appearance of such a person. . . . . . is the primary threat that is facing the government. Continue to stay on your guard. Understood. When I repealed the Refugee Special Action Policy, my intent was. . . . . .to curb profiteering against the refugees. . . . . .and resolve the problem, starting with the taxation issue. Which must mean that a political opponent used it to his advantage. I wouldn't worry about it unduly, ma'am. Excuse us. Why didn't you give her my report on Gohda of the CIS? I thought that was why we came all this way. I didn't have the heart to break the news to her in the state she's in. Hey, you've never been that considerate with me. That's because I think of you as my own daughter. I don't usually pull any punches with you. It hurts to hear you say that. . . I'd expect to be your granddaughter at the very least. That was right about the time that the pointless war for control over Eurasia. . . . . .was finally winding down. I snuck my way into the peninsula a few times back then. They were already pretty modernized by that point. Did you guys start already? Not yet. We were just warming up while we were waiting for you. So, what do you say we get started? A thousand pardons for putting you straight to work so soon after your return. Oh, thanks. It was 2024, and nations across the world were exhausted. . . . . .from a fourth world war. Japan couldn't say no to the UN, as they were profiting from war procurements. . . . . .and weren't participating in the fighting. Aside from the battle to recapture Nemuro. . . . . .the Self Defense Army had managed. . . . . .to avoid seeing any combat through two world wars. . . . . .so this would be their first trial under fire. But the Boss Man and the Major were both. . . . . .overseas in an unofficial capacity during the war, right? Pretty much. Unofficial, 'cause the PM who was killed by a terrorist bomb back then. . . . . .was one of the few politicians who had an international outlook. Because of all this stuff going on behind the scenes. . . . . .the government had strict press control to keep domestic public opinion in check. And the location chosen to deploy the PKF troops was Sinuiju. . . . . .which was considered relatively safe. I still remember the uproar over the deployment. But I guess everybody lost interest when all the news reports showed. . . . . .was bored-looking SDA soldiers spending time with the locals. I'm not surprised. The reality of the situation was something entirely different, though. And the people running the press control from the shadows. . . . . .were the forerunners of today's CIS, the Cabinet Press Agency. So, what was this '' real state of affairs '' with the PKF? Well. . . Apparently, things there were a lot more tragic than we'd heard. The unit that Kuze was attached to was mechanized. . . . . .and it was the last of the main forces to be sent into the country. At the time, Sinuiju was a special administrative area. . . . . .as well as a trade center, so it was off everybody's list of targets. But the place that the fleeing remnants of the People's Army chose. . . . . .to make their last stand after the unified government was set up. . . . . .was a rural area about 20km to the east of the city. Almost as soon as they arrived, the cyborg infantry unit. . . . . .was to be deployed in two companies as a guerrilla suppression unit. They began moving into the mountains in the dead of winter. Although this was their first large-scale deployment on the front lines. . . . . .the hybrid PKF prosthetic bodies probably weren't pushed very hard. . . . . . not even when moving through the snow at sub-zero temperatures. Around that time, the main force was on a heightened state of alert. . . . . .after receiving intel that the last elite troops of the People's Army. . . . . .were planning an assault on Sinuiju. The plan was for Kuze's company. . . . . .to circle around from the north and launch a preemptive attack. But when Kuze's platoon had moved out ahead, they discovered. . . . . .a refugee camp on the river that flowed along the border. This wasn't in their intel. A brutal raid was underway by soldiers of the People's Army. These men, who were soldiers in name only. . . . . . had been reduced to mountain bandits. Seeing this, Kuze and his platoon were spurred into action. . . . . . by righteous indignation. It was a battle of 1 20 against 30. . . . . . but it was all over in the blink of an eye. This was because Kuze's platoon was an elite cyborg unit. . . . . .and the people attacking the camp, although they were ex-military. . . . . .were mostly flesh and blood, and every one of them was starved half to death. Even though they received several reports. . . . . .on the People's Army afterwards. . . . . .this incident was the only time that they saw combat. Despite the stress from the extreme cold. . . . . .and not knowing when or if the guerrillas would attack. . . . . .the main forces, which had set up camp inside the city, didn't have it very hard. I remember seeing this footage. Yeah. But before long, there was trouble in the squad camp out in the rural area. PTSD, huh? You got it. Post-traumatic stress disorder. The experience of going through combat for the first time. . . . . .and a one-sided slaughter at that. . . . . .slowly began to eat away at the spirits of the young soldiers. Those who still had their own lungs and other internal organs. . . . . .desperately tried to escape the flashbacks. . . . . .and nightmares of the massacre. . . . . . by turning to synthetic alcohol and hashish. . . . . .that the refugees had brought them. Up until then, the Self Defense Army had been known as being very disciplined. When it began to break down. . . . . .the Japanese media began to criticize them harshly. Although the facts of the massacre at the refugee camp. . . . . . never reached the ears of the media because of a press blackout. . . . . .this made their criticism of the men's behavior all the more severe. The press blackout was put in place. . . . . .to keep the soldiers' shameful behavior a secret. . . . . .and this further restricted their freedom. It eventually got to the point where they weren't even allowed to return to Japan. Almost sounds like an isolation ward. . . Yeah, and to top it all off. . . . . . news of the massacre at the refugee camp near the border. . . . . .was leaked to certain media outlets. Rumors spread that it might have been the work of Japan's Self Defense Army. The residents of the rural area came down hard on them. . . . . .demanding an explanation. But under the news blackout, the young soldiers and. . . . . .even their commanding officers. . . . . .couldn't say anything in their own defense. They couldn't do anything but stay silent and hide in their tents. One day, after this situation had gone on for some time. . . . . .a local reporter apparently said the following to one of the soldiers. He probably meant it. . . . . .as a dig against a soldier who no longer had the lungs he was born with. Hey. Do you know where the word ''assassin'' comes from? In Arabic, it means '' one who smokes hashish.'' Muslim killers who attacked Crusaders. . . . . .after the recapture of Jerusalem in the 1 1th Century. . . . . .would smoke hashish and ruthlessly carry out the killings as if in a dream. When the Crusaders saw this. . . . . .they called them ''assassins'' and were terrified of them. Did you guys use that stuff and think that this place was paradise? You invade the place, and now you keep hanging around like you're guests! You bunch of murderers. . . W-What do you want? You're right. Maybe we did think of ourselves as guests at first. Let's trade. This for one of those. Saying this, Kuze traded his weapon for a camera. . . . . .and then went into the refugee camp. Then what? What did he do in the camp? Apparently, he didn't do anything. All he did was carry the camera around. . . . . .and look through the viewfinder at the refugees going about their lives. . . . . .and fold various origami figures. I don't get it. Yeah, I don't have the slightest idea what his real intentions were, either. But after a while, a strange phenomenon began. First, the camp's elderly gradually started to take an interest in Kuze. . . . . .and eventually offered him drinks. Next, the children begged him to make paper airplanes for them. . . . . .and one by one they befriended Kuze, who never spoke a word. And the day after that, even the women and grown men. . . . . .were taking turns talking to Kuze. Kuze would simply look at them happily and snap a picture from time to time. Then what? The People's Army surrendered, and Kuze kept this up. . . . . . until three months later, when the SDA was relieved of its duties. After that, no one in the media mentioned the massacre again. And the day before the SDA was scheduled to come back to Japan. . . . . . Kuze suddenly vanished from the camp. A single photo from the camp still exists. So, where did he go after that? They say that he crossed the border and headed west, but that's not reliable intel. As to where he drifted and how. . . . . . in the course of my investigation. . . . . . I talked to a guy who said he'd just returned. . . . . .from a refugee area in Taiwan. He said that he saw a guy there who might have been Kuze. The hair on his prosthetic body had turned completely white. . . . . . but the guy said he was positive that it was Kuze. He said the proof was that. . . . . .there was always a crowd of happy people around him. Are you Japanese? Yes. Well, I'll be. You can talk? Oh, hey, Major. Back already? Yes. I heard everything. It's a fascinating story, all right. Were you able to slip through the Coast Guard's security net as planned? Yeah. They opened up a hole for us right on time. This is the real thing. . . We'll be able to mount a war with these! We didn't buy these to fight a war. These weapons are to give us enough power so we won't have to fight. ls that one of Comrade Kuze's teachings? That's right. I still haven't met Kuze in person. . . . . .and since I don't have net access, l wouldn't know. ls he really a revolutionary? The rumors also say that he's Japanese. I don't know if he's a true revolutionary or not. . . . . . but he has great aspirations, and is a man of action who is capable. . . . . .of doing what needs to be done to achieve our objectives. Come on, let's get this cargo loaded. Sounds like Dejima's declared itself an autonomous region. Think Kuze is behind it? There's been no sign of Kuze himself, but it's a safe bet that it's him. He's making effective use of the net to leak the refugees' intentions to the media. Nanyou Shinbun Press is calling him. . . . . .the Che Guevara of the Refugee Residential District. Just what we need, another intangible hero. But the thing that I don't get is, he started as one of the individual Eleven, right? Why did the refugees accept him so easily? To answer that, all we can do is capture him and ask him in person. That's right. The first order of business is to follow the trail that leads from Kuze. . . . . .who is acting as a hub cyberbrain among the refugees, to Gohda. Do that, and we'll be able to get the authority to challenge the CIS! Let us into Dejima! Let us cross the bridge! Batou, you and the others go on ahead. . . . . .and gather information on how extensively the refugees are armed. Ishikawa and I will dive the refugee's net. . . . . .and rendezvous with you once we've pinpointed Kuze's location. - Roger! - Roger! The refugees have been building up this high-rise slum for more than 20 years. They're not totally out of line to call this place their castle. A barrier maze? He's using zoning to only allow access to refugees? No way to pinpoint his location right now. . . The route is fixed, so I think that he's somewhere in Dejima, ma'am. Hey! That must be it! Gosh, there sure are a lot of refugees accessing him. . . Even so, I don't see any particularly obvious barriers aside from the filtering. Orders, ma'am? Okay, we'll dive in before the enemy knows we're here. Prep a full sensorium mask. Our target is Kuze's visual field. We'll use his field of view to pinpoint his location. The Individual Eleven virus, huh? Seems like it. But our priority right now is finding out where Kuze is. Ishikawa, retrieve the virus file. . . . . .and determine if it acted as the trigger for the individual Eleven. I'm on it. Tachikoma! Inject mask array. I'll cross his Ghost Line using my chroma file. What the. . .? What's with this oppressive memory matrix? Major! You have to hurry! Your full sensorium mask is degrading rapidly! I wouldn't do that if I were you. If you link any deeper with me, you'll die. He can see through my full sensorium mask already? Attack barriers won't work on me! That's not what I meant. I meant that if you link with my consciousness. . . . . .it will make you miserable. That's it? Major? Tachikoma! What happened?! - Pull out of there now! - Roger! Major, snap out of it! Major! Tachikoma! Was it an attack barrier? I don't know, but I didn't detect any form of viruses or attack barriers! Hey! Major? You okay? What happened? What did you see? A delusion. . . Forget it, it's nothing. More importantly, I was able to pinpoint where he's hiding. Call Batou and the others back here. . . Where the hell is he? He disguised a ship and made it to Etorofu ! This guy is tough. . . He's on that ship right now. . . And I know him, damn it! Let's move! The deal's been made. Tomorrow, we'll finally grasp our dream. Seriously? I knew you could do it. - We have a chance now! - It's a revolution ! The individual Eleven. . . Hey, you should eat something. You sure you're okay? Disgusting. . . This tastes awful. I'll have to complain to the Chief. We have some time to kill before we land. Want to run a cyberbrain function check? I'm all right. The scope of Kuze's delusion threw me for a loop, that's all. That's what I don't get. What kind of delusions does this guy have? Frankly speaking, I guess you could call it world domination. Say what? A major case of megalomania, huh? It's not like you to let something like that get to you. Geez, you look like some teenager who's just met the man of her dreams. Right. But we know one thing for sure now. The individual Eleven virus had manifested in Kuze. . . . . .and by all rights, he should have died on that rooftop. But he willed himself to stop. . . . . .and now he's putting his own life on the line to help the refugees. His delusion itself might be a cliché, but the reason I can't laugh it off. . . . . . is that he genuinely believes he can bring peace to the world. . . . . . by becoming a dictator. That's the sense that I got from him. Plus, his adrenaline secretion levels were high enough. . . . . .to kill an ordinary man. I think we can assume that Kuze is already out of touch. What do you mean, '' out of touch ''? I mean he's lost his mind. The refugees who are continuously linked to him via a zoned and filtered net. . . . . .are getting a high off of the live feed of his actions. But they don't try to influence him or share their consciousness. . . . . . because they know that the area beyond his Ghost Line is a kill zone. Even I had a close call in there. Well, that sure was a downer. . . What is it? I got onto this ship because I heard that we were going to buy weapons. But if I'd known that you were the one who was leading the mission. . . . . . I never would have come. I see. In that case, there's no need for you to force yourself to follow me. You're free to return home, or vanish into the streets of Etorofu if you like. I won't force you to stay. I'm for a revolution, just like everyone else. But the one who first taught us how to revolt was Densetsu. Most people in Dejima now know about '' Comrade Kuze ". But there aren't very many who know who you really are. That's why I just don't buy it. I'm still prepared to follow Densetsu's teachings and blow myself up. Don't be foolish. That's nothing more than self-gratification. Revolutions are only brought about by people's Ghosts. That's why I want to know more about you. Give me a reason to believe in you. Otherwise. . . Well, how about it?! The weapon that we're here to obtain today is plutonium. I'm going to use it to force the Japanese government to recognize Dejima. . . . . .as an independent country. I've sent Batou and Saito to Sagawa's deep-earth underground factory. Ishikawa and the others, stay here on standby. . . . . .just in case we got the deal location wrong. Roger. Togusa, wait for me here. Krolden, it's me. I still owe you for your help during the Nemuro landing op. An attack barrier? He wasn't fried very long ago. . . Where was he diving that got him killed? Looks like the intruder's still in the system. Still, if he fried a hacker of Krolden's level. . . . . . he must have some serious skill. The configuration of that attack barrier. . . . . .was as resilient as that of the former Ministry of Defense. Found it. Floppies. . . I can't believe he used such antique media. . . . . .for his external memory storage. Was that guy still here because he was having trouble erasing these? Sagawa's secret ledgers, huh? For sale: lemon cake, 20 kg So that hacker was with the CIS? 240 million yen? Where did the refugees get that much money? Did Kuze line it up for them? If he did, how did he do it? Still, this was a big help. I remembered you saying that. . . . . .Sagawa Electronics was the Japanese company. . . . . .that you hated most of all. Cabinet intelligence Service investigation Unofficial White Paper Now I get it. . . You shouldn't have given up your job with the Cabinet Press Agency. If you hadn't, the CIS might have turned out as a more legitimate agency. It's almost time. We should get going. Tell me one other thing ! I once heard that you need something like 250 thousand dollars. . . . . .to buy plutonium. How are you gonna get that much money? Con the plutonium from the Russians? No, I will buy it from them fair and square. The citizens live off the sweat of our brows. . . . . .so to help them understand our suffering. . . . . . I've taken the liberty of having them each make a small donation to us. I suppose that doesn't clarify things. This is how it works. The populace, who takes food and shelter for granted. . . . . . has a combined savings. . . . . .that is easily in excess of 900 trillion yen. Of course, they also pay no attention to this sum. Did you know that among the interest accrued by those savings. . . . . .there are sums that don't officially exist? Sums that don't exist? Sums of less than one yen. Fractional numbers that aren't normally displayed even in terminal data. Simply by collecting those tiny sums from online bank accounts. . . . . . it adds up to tens of thousands of per day. I put together a program that deposits those sums into my dummy account. That is where I got the money. The public has no idea they have fractional sums of money. . . . . . in their bank accounts. And bank management is all left to A. I.s now. In spite of the fact that refugees are taxed if they work on the mainland. . . . . .they will never be allowed to become naturalized citizens. The citizens don't even realize. . . . . .the massive exploitation inherent in the system. They absorb only the information that appeals to them, that is easy to accept. It's such a phony society. I want to open their eyes to that fact. Let's hurry up and get this deal over with. As you wish. The deposit record for the account you designated is stored in here. Verify it. I'll go on ahead ! The rest of you, follow when you can ! We have a deal. Neither one of us can verify the goods. Drop your weapons and come out! You are under arrest on suspicion of violating the Arms Control Act. . . . . .and trafficking in nuclear materials! C'mon, show yourself. . . Saito! Something's fishy! - I'll handle things here! You go nab Koil! - Got it! Crap! I'm heading out! Make sure you squash that bug ! Hold it right there, Kuze! Put the cases down on the ground ! Why didn't you shoot right away? Because you know what is in the cases? I don't give a damn about those. What I'm after is your head ! I don't think you'll be able to do that. Grab the cases and get back to the ship. - But. . . - Go! You think you can take me, you bastard?! I think you're betting too much on that PKF-issue prosthetic body. It's far past its product life span. It doesn't give me an edge. And you think you're gonna beat me anyway, huh? Now that just pisses me off. . . The only way to knock out a prosthetic body. . . . . .whose pain receptors are turned off, is to give a brain concussion. Bastard ! Did you used to be a Ranger? What if I was? You're good. I probably only managed to win out of a slight difference in motivation. There are things that I still have to do. Don't follow me. Son of a. . . Over there! Batou? Why are they moving like that? They're both unmanned? Batou! - Where's Batou? - He went after Kuze! We're going after him ! What was that Armed Suit doing back there? The GSDA doesn't have any reason to get mixed up in this. - What about Koil? - Mr. Saito is chasing him ! Good. We need to launch right now. They'll be on top of us soon. If you're looking for the kid, it looks like he got off the ship. He disappeared after you and the others left to make the deal. I see. Kuze. . . Cover me! Major! They're heading for Nagasaki! We'll pick up Batou and go after them in the tilt-rotor! Roger! We'll have company soon. We'll head for Shikotan for the time being. The other ships identical to this one should have left Dejima by now. We'll wait for our people to arrive and then slip through the Coast Guard's net. The real problem is if those guys back there come at us from above. We'd better prep the AA cannon. Lead? What the hell happened? Somebody took you out, Boss Man? I'm fine, don't worry about it! We're moving out right away. Let's get after Kuze's ship. Ishikawa! Shake him off! Ishikawa! - He blew himself up! - Shit! - Doesn't look like they want to stop. . . - Threats aren't going to work here. . . - Bring us in closer. - Yes, sir. Take us in closer! Prepare for anti-ship fire! - Anti-ship fire! - Anti-ship fire! Opening fire! - Did you hit them? - Hits scored! Direct hits confirmed! They're firing on us! We've taken hits to starboard! Ship's starboard has taken fire! We are currently under attack. You're cleared to fire back in self defense! Open fire! Fire! Fire! Watch it! Stay clear of the fuel tanks! What if that plutonium gets brown- This is footage taken by a Coast Guard patrol vessel. . . . . .as it sank their disguised ship. We've incurred serious damage over the course of this case. We've had team members wounded, and we've lost our tilt-rotor as well. You could call this a complete rout. But there's been no sign of the plutonium turning up. . . . . .from Kuze's sunken ship, right? The possibility that plutonium might have been snuck into Dejima. . . . . . has the government taking this situation very seriously. I have secret information via the Home Affairs Ministry. . . . . .that a dispatch of JGSDA troops into Dejima is being considered. . . . . .as if it were an established fact. However, it's also a fact that there is insufficient grounds. . . . . .to justify dispatching troops there. So, you think that something will happen soon that will justify it. . . It's nothing but a possibility at this point. . . But it's something that seems very likely. And if that's the case, what will the refugees' next move be? If you're right, and Kuze didn't get the plutonium, what do you think he'll do? We are coming to you from above the Kyushu Radio Tower. A mass evacuation operation began five days ago, with the discovery. . . . . .of an unexploded bomb in a subway construction site, suspected of being. . . . . .a tactical nuclear device used in WWII. The evacuation of 35 million citizens within a 30 km radius. . . . . .has finally been completed under the direction of the Self Defense Army. Some parties are speculating that this may be another act of refugee terrorism. With no specific announcements on the part of the government. . . . . .and with part of Fukuoka sealed off by the Self Defense Army. . . . . . the city almost looks as if it has been placed under martial law! I'll be the first to admit there are problems with the government's response to this. . . . . .but it's not like their authority's been handed over to the military. You're right. The citizens are directing their anger over the refugee. . . . . .towards the government. . . . . .and support within the government for refugee expulsion is gaining strength. And no one is giving a second thought to what that will mean for the country. Even if this is the result of information manipulation by the CIS. . . . . .the false information they've been circulating isn't going to simply go away. Batou. What's gotten into the Major? I wrote in my report that she's been acting a little funny, ever since Dejima. . . . . .when she dove Kuze's cyberbrain. For now, focus on disposing of that nuclear bomb. The CIS has already started to take over the scene. . . . . . under the pretext of media control. I'll negotiate with the Prime Minister and ask for authorization. . . . . . to investigate the CIS. Say, Major. . . After all this, why do you think the refugees are keeping quiet? The truth had already been silenced before the phenomenon. . . Kuze must have come to that conclusion. Right now, he's keeping quiet, hiding the truth even from the refugees. . . . . .searching high and low for something that will let him turn the tables again. What makes you think that? Because that's what I'd do if I were him. Your mind doesn't seem to be on the job. And the preparations for the Japanese Miracle? - Excuse us. - Everything is ready. I see. It's unfortunate that it's come to this. As soon as the bomb defusing operation is complete. . . . . . I'll hold a press conference. . . . . .and announce the truth to the country. After that, an invasion of Dejima by the SDA will probably be authorized. Prime Minister, as I wrote in my report. . . . . .the possibility that the refugees obtained any plutonium is exceedingly small. In all probability, it is the CIS that has worsened the situation to this point. I ask that you delay any invasion of Dejima for the time being. Yes, I've read your report. However, we are already out of time. Based on intelligence obtained from the Russian authorities. . . . . .the government is now operating under the assumption that plutonium. . . . . . has already been brought into Dejima. Pardon my saying so, ma'am, but isn't that exactly what the CIS wants you to do? Nobody wants it. . . . . . but what we'll find waiting for us after an invasion by the SDA. . . . . . is an all-out war against the refugees. Please, ma'am, present the findings of that report to the Cabinet. If only I had seen this sooner. . . '' To Kayabuki with love ". . . Talk about a twisted love letter. . . I hear they used to write messages like this. . . . . .on the nose cones of bombs like Fatman or on Scud missiles. You mean they're copying the Americans? Beats me. Maybe, maybe not. You won't mind us talking right above where they're defusing that nuke, will you? So, how far are you planning to take this? Take what? Aggravating this situation. I'm afraid that's a question you must ask the refugees or a military analyst. It's outside my area of expertise. Like hell it is. The fabrication of a mediator who will give rise to copycats. . . That topic's part of your old field of research. Unbeknownst to anyone. . . . . .there was a megalomaniac whose hunger for his 1 5 minutes of fame had grown. Eventually, he wanted to produce a hero who was greater than himself. Wasn't the individual Eleven just a fake standalone complex. . . . . .created by a criminal along those lines? My, what a fascinating story. You're a sneaky son of a bitch. . . But when it's all said and done, you're just second rate. Kill the lights. - Does the cover look crooked to you? - Clear. Found it. One parallel reflector switch. Okay, I'm inserting the mirror. I've cut all the photoconductor elements. It's a mockup of an implosion-type nuke. So this is their way of saying that they did have the time and technology. They just chose not to build one, huh? What are you talking about? A different retrieval team passed through here a few minutes ago. There was a what? Boma, what's your take on the bomb after getting a look at its construction? It has '' a message from the refugees '' written all over it. . . - . . .but something's strange. - What is it? The explosives they're using are M 1 1 2 demo charges used by the U. S. Army. The refugees have always used c-4. I see. You two stay there until the end, and then meet up with the transport team. But I still haven't found anything that links the CIS to- That's enough for now. Roger that. What exactly do you mean, I'm '' second rate ''? We met a standalone-type hacker prodigy a while back. I'll admit that the individual Eleven group that committed mass suicide here. . . . . .temporarily reached ''hero'' status thanks to the theatricality of it. . . . . .and it even ended up triggering an uprising among the refugees. To the Nameless Eleven ! But can you say that their ideology caught on with the Japanese citizens? Not likely! Compared to the genius hacker we met. . . . . .the group that killed themselves here pales in comparison. The same goes for the guy who programmed the virus. . . . . .that triggered their actions. Goodness, you almost seem to be implying. . . . . .that I was the programmer in question. You almost seem to be implying that you aren't. Assuming for the moment that. . . . . .the ideology espoused by the individual Eleven. . . . . .wasn't transmitted to the citizens, as you claim. . . If their original objective was to create the chaotic situation we are faced with. . . . . .wouldn't one be forced to say. . . . . .that the criminal who produced the individual Eleven is a talented hacker? As much as I hate to admit it, there's no denying that. But before we rush to any conclusions. . . . . .we probably need to give some thought. . . . . .to the huge X-factor that's lying at the heart of this whole mess. They're up top. Hideo Kuze, the only one of the individual Eleven. . . . . .who didn't kill himself that day. . . Afterwards, he vanished to who knows where. . . . . .and when he resurfaced, he had become the leader of the refugees. Pretty strange, isn't it? Was it just a fluke? Or something that was planned from the very beginning? His behavior was the exact opposite of the other individual Eleven. . . . . .so that must be your X-factor at work. But one could say his actions. . . . . .are hastening the expulsion of refugees in the end. Given that his actions, while different. . . . . .are guiding the situation to the same conclusion. . . . . . it must mean that the criminal produced even this X-factor of yours. Would it? I'll admit that his actions are spurring on the cause of refugee expulsion, though. And now, a nuke that seems designed to represent the fury of the refugees. . . . . . is being defused below our feet as we speak. . . If it was the refugees' leader that did this. . . . . . I guess the government has no choice but to get serious. But the thing is, is it really Kuze who's behind all this? isn't it really just a fabrication cooked up. . . . . . by the criminal who's acting as his producer? Or more to the point, couldn't you say that this criminal ''producer''. . . . . . is unwittingly helping Kuze and is starting to mimic his actions? What do you mean by that? Kuze came back to Dejima from Etorofu. . . . . . but he didn't have any plutonium with him. I bet that he normally would have wanted to tell the refugees. . . . . .and resolve the situation for the time being. But despite that, we now have a terrorist situation involving plutonium. And then what? Would he play along with his ''producer's'' plans. . . . . .and use a bluff to declare war? No, he didn't do a damn thing. He's keeping silent, lying to the refugees. . . . . .and looking for a chance to turn the tables. Or maybe by keeping quiet. . . . . . isn't it actually Kuze who's drawn a trump card that can control the situation? Kuze started out as nothing more than an unknown variable. . . . . .so if it turns out that he's the real genius, the real hero in all this. . . . . . isn't it possible that the guy who thinks he's his producer. . . . . . has actually turned into Kuze's copycat somewhere along the line? It's all yours. Roger. Even though those guys believed in. . . . . .that fabricated ideology and killed themselves. . . . . .they didn't become anybody's heroes. I wonder where their Ghosts are wandering right about now. . . Major, did you get the plutonium okay? The job's done. I see. I used your external memory to keep talking about Kuze as best I could. . . . . .but I wonder if it worked. It did. We'll take this straight to SPring-8. The information warfare pros' obsession over realism. . . . . .made them leave material behind, and that's going to be their undoing. If this plutonium matches the plutonium collected from the Shinjuku nuclear plant. . . . . .it'll prove that the CIS is behind this incident. Roger that. Gohda. Just like Kuze, we haven't given up the fight yet, either. ls that so? There's one thing that l forgot to ask you. We've finished analyzing the virus used on the individual Eleven. . . . . . but we still can't pinpoint one of the factors that causes it to manifest. If it was you, what would you use as the final triggering factor? Well, if I were the culprit. . . . . .the factor l would probably use. . . . . . is the fact that they were virgins prior to getting a prosthetic body. Say what? For a hero prepared to martyr himself as a hero of the masses. . . . . . it is a factor that is absolutely necessary. Of course, it would be a bit of a gamble as to how many people. . . . . . have that particular ''gift''. . . You bastard. . . How twisted can you possibly get? You think it's twisted? If you must know, l myself am a virgin. This little chat we've had has been most enjoyable. Or informative, I should say. You have my gratitude. I expect those you are pursuing have yet to give up the fight as well. Will you stop them first. . .? Or will the situation they are producing come to fruition? I suppose the answer to that is up to our X-factor. Now, if you'll excuse me. The target vehicle has been found. . . . . .abandoned in a parking area on the Nagasaki Expressway. What about the plutonium?! There was no sign of it, sir. I see. . . We have no choice, then. We can't let the media catch wind of this. We'd like you to give top priority to information manipulation. . . . . .and work under our command to carry out the retrieval of the plutonium. I know that. I'll let you handle this, but. . . Don't worry. If you do exactly as I tell you, everything will work out fine. I'll go back to the office and begin work on spinning this situation. Understood. Well, it looks like the Major and the others are on their way. . . . . .to SPring-8 as we speak. That's good. It's been officially decided to mobilize the Self Defense Army. The Chief Cabinet Secretary's press conference is at 7 o'clock. . . . . .at which time the Self Defense Army mobilization will begin. That's less than an hour from now. Preparations are already underway in Nagasaki, I expect. Mr. Aramaki. . . I don't understand what the Chief Cabinet Secretary. . . . . . hopes to gain from allowing. . . . . .the situation to deteriorate this badly. This will do nothing but turn the situation into a quagmire. Dejima will fall almost as soon as the fighting begins. . . . . .so it won't become one of the Security Treaty's potential enemy states. But I don't believe that will work with the goals of the Chief Cabinet Secretary. . . . . .to establish a military-industrial complex. That's certainly true. Nevertheless, if we assume that the quagmire itself is his goal. . . . . . it makes a certain amount of sense. Even if the refugees surrender. . . . . .that doesn't mean they are going to go away. It establishes a reason to divert funds. . . . . .from the refugee policy to a military buildup. That's true, but it's going to mean more pressure from China as well. . . He must have some other trick up his sleeve that we aren't aware of yet. How about this, Prime Minister? Perhaps if you handed the decision over. . . . . .to the UN in order to buy some time? Major, it looks like the G SDA has a checkpoint set up ahead. Well, I didn't expect them to let us go this easily. . . What's the plan? Major, it's me. The Prime Minister has submitted a request. . . . . . to the UN for a nuclear inspection. If all goes well, the inspection team will arrive in Japan in two days. If we can hand over the plutonium to them when they arrive. . . . . . there is a strong chance that we can put an end to this situation. can you remain at large until then? Yes, if we can find somewhere to lay low. I think it'll be tricky to find a way to meet with the inspection team, though. Find a way to make it work. This might be the last card we have to play. I'll do everything I can. Also, about the Tachikoma units- What's the matter? Our signal was cut off. Maybe it's the local communications restriction provision. . . . . .of the Emergency Law System. The conference will be starting soon. I'm going to the press briefing room. So, do we have ourselves a war now? The United Nations? Did Kayabuki call them in? Yes, sir. Make the necessary preparations to oust her from office. Yes, sir. All right, let's get started. Today, we will win our independence! Live We demand that. . . . . . the Japanese government acknowledge Dejima. . . . . .as an independent country! Live: Dejima, Nagasaki Then we would be able to trade freely and be self-sufficient! Where is the crime in that?! We possess nuclear weapons! The government has admitted to this fact! This is the fruit of comrade Kuze's Labor! For that reason alone, handing him over is an unthinkable act! Furthermore, the deadline before we begin attacking is two days. The final deadline will be the arrival. . . . . .of the United Nations' nuclear inspection team. If we do not receive an answer from the refugees by that time. . . . . .our preliminary attacks will begin. That is all. Looks like it's started. Now that we've been cut off from the Chief, we have no choice. . . . . . but to operate on our own initiative. But I'll leave it up to each of you to decide whether or not to take part in this op. Hey, what's the deal? It's not like this is the first time we've had to act like a gang of rogue thugs. Aren't we just gonna play hide 'n seek with the Self Defense Army? No, we're going to take the plutonium and head to Dejima. To Dejima?! That's right. We'll sneak into Dejima under the cover of the SDA invasion. Besides, Dejima is where the inspection team will be coming. We'll apprehend Kuze. . . . . .and hand over the plutonium to them as a package deal. That's so crazy, it could only come from you. But I'll come along for the ride. I'm okay with it, too. I'm in too, of course. I don't have any objections either, but. . . You're against the idea? No, I'm gonna earn my pay in exchange for some thrills. Then that settles it. Ishikawa, what's your condition? That you, Major? I'm still laid up in bed. A little medical leave every once in a while isn't so bad. But the real reason I'm calling is that I have a favor to ask. Like what? If there's something I can do to help, just name it. I just sent a Tachikoma out to you. Inside its pod. . . . . .is half of the plutonium we recovered from the Kyushu Broadcast Tower. I want you to take it to SPring-8. Oh, okay. . . I see what you're up to. Sure, I can do that for you. But what about you guys? We're heading to Dejima with the remaining plutonium. To Dejima?! That's one seriously crazy plan you've come up with. . . What about Togusa? He's with the chief at the Prime Minister's residence. I see. Major. . . I'm sorry I can't be there with you guys, but don't do anything crazy. If they start bombing the place, there's no telling what will happen. I know. You should watch your back too. You can count on me. I'll leave you to it. Look for us on the news when we hand the plutonium to the UN inspection team. Don't get yourself killed, Major. Say, Major. Mind if I ask you something? What? Back when I used your external memories. . . . . .to have my little chat with Gohda. . . . . .well, I felt bad about doing it. . . . . . but I peeked at your memories regarding Kuze. And? It's not like l really saw anything. . . . . . but I got the impression that you have special feelings for Kuze. What happened to you when you dove his brain? Nothing special happened. But when I made contact with his memories. . . . . . he reminded me of someone l used to be close to. Used to be close to? Back when I was seriously injured, l could hardly move my body at all. I spent day after day in bed. But there was a boy in the same situation who kept me going. Admittedly, all he did was single-mindedly fold origami cranes. . . But at the time, seeing him fold cranes gave me hope to live. Later on, things worked out. . . . . .and I had to leave without getting a chance to say goodbye. I haven't seen him since. And you think Kuze was that boy? I can't say for sure. I have this strange feeling that it was him, that's all. Anyway, that's all ancient history now. Okay, we're just about there! So, you must be Hideo Kuze. And you are. . .? You know, l saw you overseas once. ls that so? You were surrounded by throngs of people in Taiwan. . . . . . but it seems like there aren't many people in Dejima. . . . . .who know what you look like. It's because many people here have cyberbrains. Ah, I see. That's how you're circulating your beliefs among the refugees. Of course, I think it's a miracle that you've had the mental strength. . . . . .to continuously answer questions from three million people. Yes, but there is a hidden danger in it. Hidden danger? Yes. Just as water runs downhill. . . . . .the human heart also tends to revert to its basest instincts. After I broke free of the ideological virus and returned to Dejima. . . . . . many refugees began to link with me. Ever since then, I've come to value their goals. Helping them fulfill their dream has become my sole motivating principle. That's why it didn't prove very difficult to become their leader. If you place your duties and your rights on the scales to weigh them. . . . . .and first add weights to the ''rights'' side. . . . . .you won't lose your sense of self even if you obey society's rules. Yes. That universal concept seemed very appealing to me. But once the refugees figure out the net. . . . . .and learn of the upper levels of the hierarchy. . . . . .they forget all that, and revert to their basest instincts. When one has power, one wants to flaunt it. Just like when you have a weapon, you want to try it out. If you knew that, why have you drawn out the situation this far? Did you seriously think. . . . . .that you'd be able to accomplish this ''revolution'' nonsense so easily? No, I didn't. However, the revolution l have in mind is still a ways off. Long ago, I left public service out of a fascination towards people. If you'll listen to the advice of a doddering old man like me. . . . . . I'd say that you should put your priority on reality rather than ideals right now. You can still put an end to this mess. Tachikoma, I'm going to dive Kuze's cyberbrain one more time. Back me up. Do you think that's safe? Connecting with him isn't difficult. The real question is whether he'll accept a message from us. Representative. We've received a report that a helicopter just took off without orders. . . . . .from the Ohmura garrison. So, we've found them. They're following my script to the letter. What's the status on our EP-3c deployment? Sir, we believe it is already on station above Dejima. Good, we'll start with that. We'll cover Dejima with a jamming signal, rendering the refugees into standalones. If we do that, the refugees will start running out of control all on their own. Gosh, the net's being cut off. . . It looks like a communications blackout is starting on Dejima. Have a defense barrier array on standby. Fire in our message file! - Roger! - Roger! What?! - What's the matter? - They're coming here? And with the plutonium. . . What are you talking about? We're cut off from the net. The SDA's jamming us? What's going on? They must be trying to isolate the refugees. The tanks are coming ! It looks like someone in the government subscribes to. . . . . .the same philosophy as me. What are we going to do? I'll go to the barricades on the bridge. It's very likely that fighting will break out. I can't allow people like you to be killed. If you can, please escape from Dejima. You're the one who can't die. There must still be something you can do. I hope you're right. Did it work?! The message got in just before the net was cut off! Good! Damn it, I'm gonna kill these guys! I hit him ! We've got a man down ! Cover us! I hear gunshots! Has fighting broken out?! Just as water runs downhill. . . . . .the human heart also tends to revert to its basest instincts. Live Dejima Bridge What the hell happened? Looks like fighting's broken out down there! The tanks are coming in just as we thought! Drop the bridge! The refugees are now completely isolated. Prime Minister Kayabuki. Moments ago, you were removed from your duties as Prime Minister. What's the meaning of this? On what grounds? Requesting a United Nations inspection team on your own authority. . . . . . may be taken as an act of treason. . . . . . under the National Emergency Law System. Under whose authority. . . What's going on? Chief Aramaki of Public Security Section 9. . . . . .you are also under suspicion of instigating treason. Please turn and go back inside that office. Hey, who the hell do you people think- It's just like that last time. . . The government was planning to do this all along ! You SDA bastards, l dare you to set foot inside Dejima! Put down your weapons! Lower them right now! Kuze. . . Don't take any action ! If you keep your weapons down, they won't attack! - Kuze? - That's really him? That's him? That's Comrade Kuze? This has gotten out of control. . . Hey! Gather some men who can stand strong ! I'll link everyone to my cyberbrain again ! We're on it! Major, you're about to enter the jamming zone! Leave a channel open even if the signal cuts out. Also, keep an eye on the situation on the water. Roger that! The Jigabachis are circling at regular intervals for now. Approaching at low altitude. . . . . .and circling around behind those high-rises would be- They were cut off, huh? Let's do it! A chopper with an incorrect IFF code is approaching. . . . . .from Dejima's north side. It disappeared into the ECM area. That must be them. Take us in on the same course. Roger. Representative, Section 4's helicopter entered Dejima a few moments ago. Good. This means we should be able to retrieve the plutonium, doesn't it, sir? Retrieving the plutonium isn't the real reason I sent Section 4 in there. What do you mean, sir? You'll understand soon enough. So, our signal's finally been cut off, huh? Yeah. I sure hope Mr. Batou is gonna be okay. I know what you mean, those gloomy A. I.s were awfully vicious. . . - Yeah, they sure were. - I'm worried. . . - Right, right. . . - I was so scared. . . That reminds me, do you think that guy's managed to. . . . . . meet up with Mr. Ishikawa yet? Good question. Hey! Did you manage to meet up with Mr. Ishikawa? c'mon, I couldn't possibly be there already! I'm going there physically on the ground, darn it! Oops, you're right. Sorry! So, how are things with you, Mr. Ishikawa? I'm on my way there, too. What happened with the Major? We have visual confirmation. They're okay for now. Good. But those Jigabachis have air supremacy. . . . . .so they're in a lot of danger. And we can't get hold of the chief, either. Looks like we'll have to work under our own initiative from here on in. The refugees and Kuze, the government and Gohda. . . . . .the Chief and the Major, and then there's us. Looks like whoever can pull off the biggest grandstand play. . . . . . is gonna win all the marbles here. It's no use, l can't set us down ! - There's debris all over the place! - We have no choice, then. We'll go down one at a time by rope. Shit! Major! The rudder's been hit! How's it coming, Proto? Can we get through to the Tachikomas? Yes, somehow. Really? l knew you could do it. I never would've been able to do that myself. Not at all, sir. You're a man who is capable of taking whatever action the situation demands. I wonder if Prime Minister Kayabuki is all right. . . She's probably being kept under house arrest somewhere. They'll keep her ousting secret from the media. . . . . . until this situation is resolved. To shift the blame onto her after the dust clears? Right. But until an official announcement is made. . . . . .she is still Prime Minister for all intents and purposes. There will still be situations where they'll need her services. That's true. Sir, I've established contact with the Tachikomas. Apparently, the Major and the others have entered Dejima with the plutonium. Dejima? I see. That was a good idea. So, what's the situation down there? Not good. Apparently, there was a skirmish between the refugees. . . . . .and the Self Defense Army. What?! Are you telling me that the Major. . . - . . .and the Boss Man were- - They can't make contact. . . . . . because Dejima is being blanketed by an ECM field. The Tachikomas can't determine whether they're alive or dead. Batou, I'm going on ahead. There's no need to rush. We can't use our comms! Don't use your optical camo! There's a chance you'll hit one of our own ! I don't see Mr. Batou and the others. . . A second helicopter is at the crash site. . . l wonder what that's all about? It looked like some soldiers got out. . . l don't get it. I don't see the Major, either. They might be using optical camouflage. Hey, everybody! What do you think this is? - What? Show us! - Show us! 3 7 0km east of the Okinawa reef. . . There's a huge metallic mass that's surfacing. . . . . .just barely inside Japan's exclusive economic zone! You don't suppose this is a. . . It's not one of the American Empire's nuclear submarines, is it? An American Empire nuclear sub? What do you suppose it means that they're inside. . . . . .the 200 nautical mile boundary? Gohda's been controlling everything. . . . . .assuming all along that this would happen. ls that also why the Chief Cabinet Secretary put such a rush. . . . . .on the American Empire-Japan Security Treaty? It's not beyond the realm of possibility. Chief! Let's bring Prime Minister Kayabuki back here! Like you said earlier. . . . . .she's still Japan's Prime Minister as far as. . . . . .diplomatic relations are concerned ! She might be able to use her authority to stop the nuclear attack! Yes, you're right. . . Proto, do you know where they're holding the Prime Minister? I'll run a search right away. Proto! Hey, are you all right?! Shit, an attack barrier? Mr. Togusa. . . Proto. . . I found the Prime Minister's location. . . Proto? You're an android? No. . . I'm a bioroid prototype. . . Here it comes! Right. I doubt they're expecting to be shot at with Stingers. They got careless. Fire! You got 'em ! Their attack choppers will be here soon ! Let's clear out! Kuze. . . If we stay in here, we'll end up getting pinned down. You guys head out first. I'll come out last with the plutonium. We'll meet up in the buildings behind us. It's a maze in there. We can still win this. They're using thermoptic camo! Our target doesn't look like your average SDA unit! What's going on here? Our orders said that the people who made off with the plutonium. . . . . .were five low-ranking soldiers! Okay, split into two teams! We'll pursue using formation B! Roger! Go on ahead ! Don't be stupid ! Hold it. This is strange. The ECM isn't working. Something's gone wrong. Okay, people, switch on your comms. Pursue using formation A. Proto, can you lock the door? Yes, sir. I'm sorry for putting you through all this trouble. . . That's all right. More importantly, have you gotten any more reports from the Tachikomas? Yes, sir. The nuclear sub doesn't appear to be doing anything. Also, it looks like the sentry plane over Dejima has crashed. The refugees shot it down? I don't have all the details, but it's likely. Which means that we can get through to Dejima now, doesn't it? Representative, it looks like the MSDA's sentry plane has been shot down. Oh, he's trying to reunite the isolated refugees, is he? It's time to make the finishing touches. Manipulate the Defense Ministry. . . . . .into carrying out a series of bombardments from their ships. Understood, sir. Is anyone here? Yes, sir. I'd like you to mail a letter for me. A letter, sir? That's right. By express delivery. Metropolitan Police Tachikoma! Do you read me? We read you, Major! - We have a lock on the Major's position ! - So Mr. Batou's okay! What's the status of Batou's team? They're safe. They seem to be inside a building, so we can't get visual confirmation. I've found Kuze. Relay my position to Batou and the others. Yes, ma'am. Major, we've got some terrible news. . . What is it? An American Empire nuclear sub is. . . . . .holding position off the coast of Okinawa. . . . . .and it looks like it's planning to launch a nuclear missile at Dejima. Are you sure? Give me a visual feed! Roger! What the hell?! Why did we bother to bring this here?! Son of a bitch! What about the arrival of the inspection team, Major? Batou, start heading for the bridge right away with the plutonium. They're going to launch the nuclear missile before. . . . . . the inspection team gets here! Give the plutonium to the SDA forces who are holding the bridge. . . . . .and explain the situation to them! No, you get out of here first, Major. We're being pursued by some tough guys. We'll try to move as fast as we can, but things might get a little hairy here. Who's after you? My guess is the Rangers from Section 4. You're certain? Yeah. Looks like they've followed us here to get the plutonium back. I'll meet up with you soon. Do whatever it takes to give them the slip. We'll give it our best shot. Let's move! ls this the second time that we've met? No, the third? Why are you following me? We went through a lot of trouble to come here. We brought the plutonium, just like we said. Come with me. If you don't, there'll be a huge number of casualties, refugees included. And they're going to put the blame for it squarely on your shoulders. What's about to happen? My guess is a nuclear attack disguised as the refugees blowing themselves up. What?! Who are you? Hey, it looks like the Aegis cruisers are gonna start attacking with missiles. . . . . . before the nuclear strike begins! They caught up to us, huh? Looks that way. They switched to a different formation. Activate optical camouflage. Tachikoma, can you locate their encrypted signals and run a back-hack? We'll give it a try, but you should be careful. There will be a missile attack from the Aegis cruisers soon. I don't think they'll attack the residential area directly, but. . . . . .who knows where the missiles will land? What about that nuclear missile? It hasn't been launched yet. They didn't waste any time getting started. . . Got movement over here, too. Damn, they've started. We don't have much time. We'll surrender to the SDA together. I'll drag you there if I have to. What'll it be? Very well. I'm explaining the situation to the refugees who are. . . . . .currently connected to me. I'll leave the final decision up to them, but for the time being. . . . . . let's head to the bridge. Tachikoma, show me the trajectory of the- Are you all right? Yes. It looks like things have quieted down for now. Tachikoma, situation report. Major! You're okay! Yeah, somehow. The nuclear missile might be launched any minute now. You should get out of the area right away! Any announcements from the government? They made a statement that there would be a limited series of air strikes. . . . . .in order to send in the inspection team. It's no use. It looks like we're sealed in. We are, huh? Major, don't tell me you're- Yeah. I'm trapped beneath a pile of debris. I'll have to leave this in Batou's hands now. Oh, no! Isn't there anything you can do to get out? I'll see what I can do. . . . . .but focus all your attention on assisting Batou's team. Roger! Are you linked with the refugees? Yes. A good number of them have returned. It looks like most of them are in a panic thanks to that air strike, though. You said something about a nuclear attack. How did you find out about it? What group do you work for? Believe it or not, I'm a police officer. In the course of investigating the individual Eleven crime. . . . . .we uncovered a government project to physically drive out the refugees. We've been trailing you in order to expose it. If that's true, why bring the plutonium here? Because we knew that you hadn't been given any plutonium. So we stole the nuclear bomb that was used in Fukuoka. . . . . .and tried to use that as evidence to resolve this situation. But the plan our enemy came up with unfolded faster than we anticipated. We never expected him to make a deal. . . . . .with the American Empire for a nuclear strike. What's happened to the plutonium? My team should be bringing it to the Self Defense Army. . . . . . but they've been surrounded by a squad that was tailing them. . . . . .so that's going to be difficult now, too. I see. So, have you given up on the idea of making me turn myself in? I haven't exactly abandoned the idea, but. . . I turned off the zoning and filtering on my hub cyberbrain a while ago. Anyone who wants to can connect and see everything that is happening here. We can try to get out of here. . . . . . but I'm going to try to carry out my revolution at the same time. I made up my mind to go through with it when you told me of the nuclear strike. Made up your mind? What do you mean, revolution? Tachikoma, haven't you been able to run a back-hack. . . . . .on their communications yet? No, sir. They seem to be changing their encryption at random. . . . . .based on prime numbers. Get down! - We're moving out. - Got it. We're going outside. Tachikoma, how's that back-hack coming? Just a little longer! Kuze, what's this ''revolution'' you keep talking about? The transference of people to the superstructure. To have people cast off the fossilized system and fuse with the net. Fuse with the net? Chief, I brought her. Proto, open the door. Are you all right, Prime Minister Kayabuki? I'm up to speed on the situation. Can you patch my hotline to. . . . . .the American Empire through to this room? I'll try requesting that they call off the nuclear strike. Please do. It all hinges on whether or not they realize what is going on. You have a point. Hold it right there. We have you surrounded. Put down the plutonium and disengage your optical camo! Mr. Batou! The back-hack is in place! All right, I'm setting it down ! While I'm putting the case down, make a break for the walls. Roger. What the-?! Hold your fire! You'll hit our own men ! I'm going to disengage my optical camouflage now. If you still feel like carrying out your mission after I do. . . . . .go ahead and shoot me. But if seeing my face convinces you otherwise, listen to what I have to say. This is a matter of life and death ! You're. . . Those eyes. . . Were you a Ranger? That's right. My experiences on the peninsula gave me an insight into life. I found an order full of contradictions. Exploitation at the hands of the powerful. A structure that had grown corrupt. But what disillusioned me most of all. . . . . .was the utter lack of responsibility of the people. Even though they haven't created anything themselves. . . . . .and understand nothing. . . . . .when the masses come across information that they agree with. . . . . .they immediately internalize it and are thus controlled. People who feel no sense of responsibility. . . . . . no matter the unintended consequences. . . . . .caused by their unmotivated actions. . . . . . making poor use of the net's infrastructure. My revolution is also an act of revenge against such people. Revenge? I've had a full prosthetic body since childhood, so I've constantly felt. . . . . .disparity between my mind and body. If such a thing could be done. . . . . . I wanted to abandon this clumsy body and paddle out onto the sea of the net. The Asian refugees gave a man like me hope to live, at the very least. They told me that my artificial face was handsome. . . . . .and flattered me by saying that my Ghost can be seen in it. It was then that it hit home for the first time. . . . . .that the spirit and the body might be inseparable. And I was able to think of myself as a human being with a body of his own. But when they come across information that they find palatable. . . . . .they get swept along in the direction that is easiest, just like everyone else. I suppose that in the end. . . . . . humans are designed to follow the path of least resistance. So? How are you planning to carry out your revenge? I will take into the net the memories and Ghosts. . . . . .of those who are linked to me. They will lose their physical bodies if a nuke is dropped here. . . . . . but they will gain the chance to undergo a forced evolution. What are the odds of them being able to retain their individuality in the net? I don't have the answer to that. But as pioneers, they might become beings. . . . . .who will enlighten those left behind in the base. . . . . .constantly making them aware of the superstructure. In exactly the same way that humans have felt reverence. . . . . .towards spiritual beings since ancient times. That's your revenge against, and offer of salvation. . . . . .to those who let you down? Yes, although I believe it is a revolution. I see that you're full-prosthetic, too. Then you have felt the doubts and fears caused by the disparity. . . . . . between body and spirit. What do you say? Will you come with me? Do the refugees intend to go with you? Yes, unfortunately. Most prefer the idea of carrying out the '' nuclear suicide bombing '' scenario. They probably want to feel like they weren't defeated. Even though that, too, is taking the easy way out. . . I see. Batou. I'm going to try rescuing the refugees using the method that Kuze suggested. The rest of you, let the Self Defense Army know about the nuclear strike. Batou, are you listening to me? You crazy bitch ! I'm not letting you go alone. . . Wait for me! No way am I gonna let you go alone! What are they waiting for? Beats me. Anyway, let's get this to the bridge. The GSDA might believe your story if it comes from us. Once the second air strike is over, commence the invasion of Dejima. We'll get ready for the inspection team ! Another air strike has started ! Has anybody managed to find any signals from the crew? It's no use! I don't see any signals that we might be able to back-hack! Tachikoma! Gather up all the free space you can find in cyberspace. . . . . .and secure enough room. . . . . . to upload the memories and Ghosts of three million people. Why would you want us to do that, all of the sudden? There's no time to explain. Just get to it! B-But is that even possible? I don't know. But I don't see any other way to salvage the refugees. Get to it! R-Roger! I just ordered my support A. I.s. . . . . .to start work on securing all the available room in cyberspace. Once they're ready, let's get started. Thanks. Even if we manage to survive by uploading our Ghosts into cyberspace. . . . . .what about those refugees who don't have cyberbrains? Refugees with family members like that. . . . . .will have difficulty accepting this decision. I expect that they will lose faith in me and leave Dejima of their own accord. In cases like this, the role of the leader is both invaluable. . . . . .and filled with uncertainty. When you're in a position where you have to lead many people. . . . . .you're sometimes forced to make tough decisions to deal with a situation. I'm sure that those people will understand. I hope you're right. Tachikoma! What's the shortest route to the Major's location?! Mr. Batou?! I thought you were going to the bridge! I'm gonna help the Major to. . . Mr. Batou? The line went dead. . . Do you think they'll use the confusion caused by the air strike. . . . . .to fire off the nuclear missile? Judging from how the submarine is running completely silent. . . . . .the launch time might have been set beforehand. If that's the case. . . If we look at the timing of the Aegis cruiser withdrawal. . . . . .and micromachine dispersal. . . . . .we might be looking at a launch time of 1 0:00 hours. . . Guys, tell me what you really think. Do you think the refugees' Ghosts will be preserved. . . . . .just by uploading their memories to the net? From a biological activity standpoint. . . . . . memories are a vital component, all right. But without a Ghost, memories are nothing more than data. But isn't the Major betting everything on this as their last hope? I understand that, but this order is crazy! I think so, too. But if we don't do something, we can't save Mr. Batou and the others, either. That's why I think that we ought to ignore the Major's order. - What are you saying we should do, then?! - We can't do that! It's no use. I'm not getting a response. The hotline is active and working properly, but. . . But that would mean. . . This is so frustrating. If Takakura is willing to go this far. . . . . . I'll put an end to this situation my own way! Who are you calling, ma'am? All right, we did it! This makes eight! Calculations like this are what we do best! - Yeah ! - Totally! This next satellite will let us put up a flak curtain along the missile's trajectory! Just like you said, even if it meant disobeying the Major's orders. . . . . .deciding to take a chance on dropping satellites in its path. . . . . .sure was the right call ! Yeah. . . What's the matter? The plan's gonna work! The thing is. . . Well, isn't this satellite the one that our A. I. is kept on? - What?! - Huh?! I don't get it! That's an American Empire satellite! Yeah. . . But it looks like we're being stored in leased payload space. . . . . .on an American Empire satellite that was launched from Japan. Aw, what the hell?! Even without that Security Treaty, we're still doing exactly what they say! Even so, why would the Major put our A. I. onto one of their satellites? Well, maybe she was planning to use us to spy on them or something. There's no way to know, but this really puts us in a tough spot. . . We're almost out of time! Mr. Ishikawa! Yeah, what? Um, I have to go somewhere with the guys. . . You do, huh? I'm sorry. That's okay. Look after the Major and the others. Sure! Major? Where are you? - Kuze. - Yes? Do you know how to fold origami cranes? Cranes? Yeah. And only using your left hand. With the proper control software, anyone can do that. That's not what I mean. Can you do that? Fold one left-handed? I can now. It sounds like you've also survived your fair share of loneliness. I never asked, but what's your name? I don't remember. I have a pseudonym, though. It's the same with you, isn't it? You're right. I've been given countless names by the refugees. I joined forces with them with the intent to save them. . . . . . but maybe the real reason l joined them. . . . . .was to keep the loneliness at bay. But in the end, it wouldn't go away. Because even if others could count on you, you couldn't count on them. Do you have someone that you can open yourself up to? I suppose. . . I see. . . I've been looking for mine for a long time. Motoko! When we hold our hands up to the sun and peek through our fingers. . . . . .we can see the deep red blood flowing inside! Even earthworms, even crickets. . . - . . .and even water striders! - I don't believe it. . . - . . .and even water striders! - . . .and even water striders! - I bet that you guys have Ghosts. . . - I bet that you guys have Ghosts. . . - We're all alive, every last one of us. . . - I bet that you guys have Ghosts. . . - We're all alive, every last one of us. . . - . . .and we're all friends! - . . .and we're all friends! - What's wrong?! Proto! - . . .and we're all friends! We're all alive, every last one of us. . . . . .and we can laugh 'cause we're alive! We're all alive, every last one of us, and we can feel happy 'cause we're alive! When we hold our hands up to the sun and peek through our fingers. . . . . .we can see the deep red blood flowing inside! Even dragonflies, even frogs. . . . . .and even honey bees! We're all alive, every last one of us, and we're all. . . What's the matter, Proto? What happened? It looks like the Tachikomas rammed their satellite into the nuclear missile. They did what?! So we've managed to avoid a worst-case scenario, then. Yes, sir. I'm sorry, I don't follow you. It seems that some of my people sacrificed themselves. . . . . .to stop the nuclear missile. You lost some of your men?! That's not important, ma'am. Who did you call just now? It's me. The missile was intercepted? Well, no matter. Either way, we'll use Kayabuki's actions to establish a cold-war framework. What a shame, he wasn't able to become a hero. . . What happened? I don't know why. . . . . . but it looks like my A. I.'s did something other than what I ordered them to. Major! You okay in there?! The Tachikomas. . . I know. Chief. If the Prime Minister contacted who I thought she contacted, it'll- Yes, I know. But for now, arresting the Chief Cabinet Secretary and Gohda takes priority. There's a chance that what happened today. . . . . .won't be made public in our lifetimes. First, let's clean up this mess as quickly as possible. Understood ! Enter. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takakura. . . . . . I assume you know the reason why we're here. Your actions amount to a coup d'etat. . . . . .as well as mass murder under the guise of war. I've been prepared for that all along. And as for you, you were even more of a woman than I thought you would be. I don't know who you begged for help in the midst of an emotional fit. . . . . . but this country can't stand on its own without the American Empire! You seem to be working under a false impression. That doesn't look like a nuclear explosion. Orders, sir? Shall we launch a second missile? No. Let's hold off. . . . . . until we ID the southbound bogeys that're approaching from the northeast. What if they're marked with the People's Liberation Army insignia? '' National independence through personal independence.'' I believe I have acted in accordance with that ideal ever since I took office. The Kayabuki administration. . . . . .will continue to maintain an equal distance from the American Empire. . . . . .the Ameri-Soviet Union, China, as well as Asia and the nations of the EU. I intend to pursue. . . . . .a policy of independent action and UN reconciliation. A secret Air Self Defense Army unit, huh? All right, Japan's made their intentions clear. We're pulling out. Take him away. Yes, ma'am. The Prime Minster sent us! Get in ! You got it! Stand up. I'll take this back, if you don't mind. Saito! Paz! Boma! You still in one piece, Major? Yeah. Sorry, but stay put and give a thorough report to the Self Defense Army. Understood. You're. . . Ishikawa of Public Security Section 9? I'll take that, if you don't mind. Oh, you mean this? That's right. Don't screw with us. Section 9 specializes in dirty tricks and information warfare. If the vassal state is negligent in its services. . . . . .the starvation of the consumer state is inevitable. Manpower shortages always give the slave manufacturing industries a boost. But if you're too strident in asserting rights. . . . . .the arteries of capitalism will harden. In its mind, this country has always thought of itself as a capitalist state. . . . . . but in reality, it is the ideal socialist state. But when arterial waste matter builds up. . . . . . brains capable of managing. . . . . .the blood's distribution become necessary. With its claims of liberty and equality, I'm sure it's the same in your country. Of course! But what we do publicly and behind closed doors. . . . . .are different matters entirely. All right. . . Do it! Don't do it! Don't be in such a hurry to die. Mr. Aramaki. . . What might this be about? Kazundo Gohda! You are under suspicion of conspiring to start a civil war, as well as. . . . . .conspiring with a foreign power to start a war for personal gain. You're coming with us. The Chief Cabinet Secretary has already admitted to most of the charges. Also, the final act of the play you produced was a flop. Are you sure? Even so, arresting me now would be pointless. What's that supposed to mean? The Chief Cabinet Secretary and I have always. . . . . . had a standalone relationship. Also, a report written by me personally should already be. . . . . .at Metropolitan Police Headquarters. Didn't you know? The penal code says that because I came forward voluntarily. . . . . . I can't be charged with any of the crimes you just mentioned. I'm going to a country that is in need of my abilities. Are you sure? That's how you want to play it? I have a note from the Prime Minister. She holds your abilities in the highest regard. But if there's a chance those talents might end up. . . . . . in the hands of a foreign power. . . . . .we're to prevent it, no matter the cost. She also says that, if it proves necessary. . . . . .we shouldn't hesitate to use lethal force. How do you want to do this? Don't worry about him. it's just a bluff. Let's go. Right. You think so, do you? Then go ahead and die! Gee, what a cryin' shame. . . Hi. . . ! Hey, you're. . . How long have you people been involved in this?! Chief! Hurry! We can't let them eliminate him ! Major! What's that you have there? A crane. . . A crane? Goodness, these micromachines are rather effective, aren't they? You'll have a painless death. You're a fascinating person, but we see you as a dangerous element. Your country has no need of charismatic leaders that can't be controlled. Docile consumers, that's the ticket. I'll go on ahead. . . Major! Where are you off goofing around?! Rendezvous with Azuma and Proto in Niihama Ward 4! What's the matter? The supplementary budget you requested was passed in its entirety. Fuchikoma! information ! Yes, sir! Say, Major. . . Many lives were lost in this incident. . . All it's done is return the refugee issue back to square one. . . . . .and PM Kayabuki's ''SeIf-reliant United Front'' policy. . . . . .will probably prove to be a thorny path for the populace. People like us will be needed more than ever now. Maybe. Hey, what's with you? You make it sound like it's somebody else's problem. Come on, Major, you haven't gone all philosophical on us, have you? Major, I have a report stating that the supplementary budget passed. . . . . . in the 329th session of Parliament. Right! I'm calling off our round-the-clock cherry blossom surveillance operation ! Saddle up, we're back on the job! 'Bout damn time. . . Yeah. . . I thought I was gonna die of boredom. I shoulda had a drink to warm myself up. Nice to have our Major back. . . What about the briefing? Seeing colors Wanna handle it with a brain dive? No, you go on ahead without me and take command. Ribbons of their truth I'll meet up with you later. You will? Can I touch to reconnect? See beyond the light What is it? it's nothing, forget about it. ln Bubbles rise-- to surface in someone's eye ln Bubbles rise-- Synchrons that dwell Silence is crying, is crying Open doors and empty glasses Christmas in the Silent Forest The limp ticking of the hand Penetrate in whispers ln shadows rise-- to surface in someone's mind Echoes that dwell. . . Silence is crying, is crying Open doors and empty glasses Christmas in the Silent Forest The limp ticking of the hand Hollow hush of trees How do you keep? Sweet slumber, sleep among the forest trees
