Collier: Murder, 99 years' hard labor. Fat chance. Search them inside and out. Come on, you. Oh. Hey, wait a minute. Ah! Okay, next. Will you sit down there, please? Well, you don't look like a hardened criminal to me. Oh, cold. Sorry, I guess I'm a little nervous too. Why? You expecting a baby? Aren't you a real doctor? Well, no. It's just, this is my first day here too. Well, I shouldn't even be here. My trial was a real joke. Those fucking banana Republic cops. I met the wardress this morning. She seemed like a warm person. Be of some comfort to know That she's concerned about the prisoners. I bet she is. Breathe out. Let's go, young woman. I haven't finished yet. How does she seem so far? - Very well. - Good. That is what you write in your report. Keep moving. Green, scared, and pretty. Ho, ho, ho, are we gonna have fun. I'm marne, marne Collier. "Collier" is all you use around here. I'm alcott. That's grear. And bodine's up there. Hello. And don't try and mess around with her ever. Not even grear messes with bodine. Ferina. And that's harrad, what's left of her. Say hello. Hello. To her, stupid. [Sighs] Hello. You know, the girl who used to sleep there, She died last night. Here, honey. You can bed down over here, where I can take care of you. Harrad. Harrad! - Hmm? - Out. You can take that bed. Go on. Out. Move, dummy! Okay. Okay. Um... Don't you want the lower? I like being on top. Ho, ho, ho. Now, look here, alcott. [Cat meows] She say she want to talk to you. [Cat meows] You hear her? What does she say? She say that nighttime has a lot of surprises. What the hell are you doing? Hey, what's going on here? What's happening? She's a fink. What? They put her in here to spy on us. You're out of your mind. What do you think, ferina? Tell us. Yeah, she's a spy. Why don't you go catch a flying... Get her, alcott. Come on. Made her confess. Oh, come on, guys. What are you doing? Oh, cut it out. Oh! Come on. Make her talk. No! Who was it, Collins? No one! Tell us, damn it. Fine, fine, fine. I wonder if this is gonna make you talk. Tell us. Oh, please don't. Oh, no, no, please don't do that. Please? That's enough. Stay out of this, bodine. She's just a scared kid. Leave her alone. It's all in fun. I said that's enough. Okay, bodine. Okay. We therefore commit your body to the ground. Ashes to ashes and dust to dust. Looking for the general resurrection In the last day in the life of the world to come Through our lord Jesus Christ, At whose coming in glorious majesty To the judge the world, The earth and the sea shall give up their dead. And the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him Shall be changed and made alike unto those glorious bodies According to the mighty working Whereby he is to subdue all things unto himself. The grace of our lord Jesus Christ And the love of God And the fellowship of the holy spirit Be with you all. Amen. Ms. Dietrich. What is it? It's about o'Connor. I don't believe she was killed trying to escape. Alcott, what do you think you're doing? Let's discuss this some other time. * to arms of my true love * and there I would stay until I die * - hold it, friend. - What is it? Another perfectly good piece of ass gone to waste. Well, what do you mean? Up in smoke. Go on, Fred. When I was first thrown into the isolation cell, O'Connor was there. Lucian came and took her out. Then I heard her screaming. How do you know it was o'Connor screaming? I recognized her voice. But a person's voice is distorted when he screams. [Sighs] However, I'm glad you brought this up. I promise to look into the matter. Call on me any time you have a problem. I think I have one now. I'm afraid I'll be next. Hey, man, you got some fringe benefits going for you too, huh? Oh, hell, yeah. Some of them ain't been Within spitting distance of a man in years. - Yeah? - You know what? - What? - They are so horny. Yeah? Sometimes, late at night, when it's real quiet, You can hear them honking. Will you get out of here? [Laughs] Put it down over there. Hi, boys. - How you doing, sweetheart? - Fine. Hi. Hey, hey, did you ever make it With any of these girls around here, man, huh? Not yet, Freddy. There's always a bunch of guards hanging around. Either that or they're all locked up. One of these days, zap. What do you mean, "zap," man? What is that, "zap"? Zap! R-a-p-e, zap. What a minute. Wait a minute. You mean to tell me you're gonna rape one of these girls With all these guards hanging around? [Laughs] I ain't gonna rape one of them. One of them is gonna rape me. Go, Lucian, go. Come on. Come on, mendoza. Come on. That's it. Go, boy. That's it. Come on, baby! That's... Hey. What are you doing? That's no fair. And I was gonna put mendoza out for stud. Ugh. I've met this one called Lucian. But who is this mendoza? Colonel mendoza is the head of the secret police. He runs this prison like it's his own private little playpen. So they say. But no one has ever seen him. Correction: Nobody still alive has ever seen him. Don't worry, Collier. They're only interested in political prisoners Like bodine here. What do you mean? Her boyfriend is up in the mountains Trying to start a revolution. There already is a revolution. Rafael is only a man who's committed to it. And you're committed to him? Ooh, watch it, stranger. She's a mite bit touchy about that subject. I can dig that. Yeah? You got a man on the outside, honey? Well, not anymore. Actually, I'm a widow. And that's why you're here, right? Yeah. He was a very rich, very handsome playboy With a black patch over one eye. No, really, it's true. Fernando. His father owned half the country. Money like you wouldn't believe. Anyway, I figured a girl could do a lot worse. And naturally he swept me right off my feet, And I ended up in this fantastic pad With a dozen servants. The whole works, right? Just like in a dream. Only there was one very important thing missing. I get it. No action. Then what? Well, I caught him making it with one of the servants. The maid? The houseboy. No shit. What did you do? Well, what do you think I did? I mean, you know, the houseboy looked pretty good to me too. As a matter of fact, he was. Only Fernando was not as broad-minded as I am. So he decided to kill me. Well, I said to hell with that. So I went and got his gun, Which he used to keep under his pillow, And I put one right through his patch. Good for you, that son of a bitch. And what about you, grear? What did you do? For just hustling. That's all. See, I had this John who worked for the government. He talked a lot. So one day, somebody decided that he told me things I shouldn't know. So 30 years for just hustling. Wow. And her? Harrad, what are you in for? Infanticide. Yeah, she killed her own baby, The only thing in this world that she ever really loved. Why? Who knows? She's a junkie. [Bell rings] Come on in here, Fred. Hi, leyte, my love. Here you go, sweetheart. Have one of these. Hold it there, Fred. I want you to meet leyte. Leyte here is the fastest little gunslinger South of pago pago. Leyte, this here is my new partner, Fred. Ah, I got some good pineapple for you today. How 'bout you take this on the house, huh? Come on, Fred. Hey, wait a minute. Where's my lambanog? Ah! Leyte, I plumb forgot it. I'm sorry. Listen, I'm gonna go up in the high country, Oh, about a week Tuesday. I'll bring you back a big jug then. How's that? Don't forget. All right. Come on, Fred. Okay, girls. It's old Harry come to see you again. How you doing? [All talking at once] All right, okay. That's enough of that. Listen, I want you to meet my new partner, Fred. Hi, girls. [Everyone talking at once] Okay, that's enough. Get up the missoula. Get up the missoula, girls. Let's have the missoula. You were telling me about, man. [Inaudible conversation] She killed her old man, Slit him right up the middle just as clean as a whistle. Popcorn. - Popcorn, popcorn, all right. - Candy. Candy, candy, give her some candy. Is that gonna be it, girls? Okay, I'll see you next time. Fred, let's go on. Just move it right on down. Women: Bye! - Bye. - Yeah. Ah, Beverly my love, how are ya? [Bells jangling] Okay, girls. - Hello, Harry. - Hi, harrad. Hi, Harry. Got anything for me today? Got a smuggled letter. What you gonna give me for it? Nothin'. Okay. All right. Come here. [Breathing heavily] Mmm. Think you can do it through the bars, Harry? [Chuckles] You just watch me. I wouldn't stand for that. Okay, that's enough. You son of a bitch! This is for bodine. You're rotten, Harry. You know why? 'Cause you're a man. All men are filthy. All they ever want to do is to get at you. For a long time, I let them get at me. That's why I'm in this dump. But no more. You hear me? I'm not gonna let a man's filthy hands touch me again! Come on, Fred. From Rafael? The government troops have found his camp. He says that only he and a few others made it out alive. He says that they need me. He needs me. Well, it's a high wall and a hard run. [Whistle blows] Hey, you, come here. Come on. This is uncensored mail. This is mail which the authorities have not inspected. You know this brings severe punishment. You will be the next one, I promise you. Psst! Harrad. Harrad. Your old man really takes good care of you. Don't I, honey? Yeah, grear, you really do. And see that you don't forget it. What'll happen to her? I mean, will she be all right? Well, one thing's for sure. She'll get a hell of a lot of sunshine. Don't worry. Bodine's very tough. Oh, by the way, Ms. bodine. I know that you are clever and strong. But you must understand. You will come as painfully close to death as is possible And still recover. To avoid this, You must answer one simple question. Where is he? Fuck you. [Breathing heavily] Where he is? [Yells] Where is he? Bodine, say something, damn it. Rafael. She tried to get me to tell where he's hiding. Won't any of you bitches help? Easy, easy. All the time she was working on me, There was a man in the corner. He was watching me. Who was he? Could you tell? No, he never spoke. But he looked like an army officer. You show yourself to the doctor, Phillips. When he sees these marks, he's bound to believe you. Phillips? He's already sold out. He's working for them, And there's no other way out of here but escape. Escape? You're out of your mind. You're never gonna bust out of this place. You'll get yourself killed. Could that be any worse than this? And what about you? You're never gonna see the outside again. "Without possibility of parole," that's what it says. No. Life is always better than certain death. That's where we disagree. If I really thought it could be done... If you really want to do it, we'll find a way. You know something? It's not the comforts I miss, like the nice clothes and... It's the men. More than anything else, I miss having a man. Let me see that. Oh, push has just come to shove. You're gonna have to unload the rest of this by yourself. Well, that figures. Well, I got to go over to the office And take care of some receipts. They're piling up on me something fierce. Um, this box right here. This one? Yeah, you take this down to the basement. All the rest of this stuff, you just put it On in the storeroom like you always do. I'll meet you back at the truck. Oh. Best get the lead out your ass, boy, 'Cause if we ain't out of here in a few minutes' time, They're liable to lock us in here for the night. That wouldn't be such a bad idea, huh? It would be if it was just me and you in the cell, Fred. [Giggling] Wash my back. More. Okay, that's enough. Hurry up so you can get out of here and fix my hair. Thanks, but no thanks. I don't want ot do things for grear anymore. I'd like to do something for you. I need a friend. Forget it, Collier. I don't care of anybody, and nobody takes care of me. I just watch out for myself. You should do the same. [Growling] [Door squeaks] [Gasps] - Hello, Fred. - Hi. You were looking at me through the window, Weren't you? No. Yeah, i... Did you like what you saw? Yeah, but, i... i mean... Then why don't you take it? Come on, lover boy. Get to work. No time for that stuff. Okay. Not the shirt, stupid. [Gasps] Get it up, or I'll cut it off. Look, Would you get rid of that thing? I... i can't concentrate. [Both moaning] Very good, miss alcott. Wait, wait. You see, it's as I told you. You're next. Where the hell you going? Get in. I'll explain it to you. Hurry up. What's your problem, boy? That storeroom back there you sent me? Yeah. This girl, she had a knife. Zap. Zap? R-a-p-e, zap. Yeah. Kiss my ass. [Moaning] Hold it. Hold it. Just a minute. Doctor. Doctor, help me. This prisoner became berserk in the isolation cell. We had to protect her from herself. Like hell you did. Those bruises look pretty bad. I'd better take a look at her. I agree, doctor. I was just now bringing her to the infirmary for inspection. The infirmary, for your information, Ms. Lucian, Is that way. There's always a certain amount of cruelty When a group is gathered under authority, They always said. The hatred they cannot express to the authority, They express to each other. Ms. Dietrich, I am talking about sadism On the part of your staff. Oh, I see. Is there anything you have observed personally? Well, I've heard stories, Particularly the testimony of one prisoner. Who would that be? It's private between patient and doctor. There are many ways The prisoners can injure themselves. She mentioned a room and another person, a man, Who was watching all the time. What time is this supposed to have taken place? Late at night. The only one I know That's permitted on the premises at night Is yourself. I suppose I shouldn't have brought up the subject. Don't be absurd. You're free to discuss anything you like. Well, thank you. Then I'd like to discuss you. Me? Yes. For example, you're so much younger than I expected And more beautiful. Well, thank you. And I was thinking, could we have dinner some time? I suppose that's possible. We don't have to have it here... No, no, here would be fine. I don't like being away. How about Thursday? That would give me enough time to prepare something special. I wouldn't like the dinner to be ordinary. That wire can't be cut. It's too hard to get over it. There must be another way. It's got to be through the front gate. Right. Outside of ferina, I don't trust any of them. I never trust anybody. I just bet on them. And I bet that there's one That wants out as badly as we do. There, just like my little doll. Don't go away. I'll be right back. Okay. Here, creep. Hold this for me. You know, there's nothing I like to see more Than prisoners who enjoy their internment. [Clears throat] Every day, you seem to be having more fun than the last. Buzz off. [Laughs] Of course, there's a price for what you get. Why don't you sew up your slimy lips? Ooh, you're cute when you're mad. Why don't you go show grear how cute you are? [Forced laughter] You want out of here pretty badly, right? Well, bodine and I are planning a break. We need your help. What do you say? Hand her over, alcott. I'm not forcing her. Come over here, you little slut. She has a choice. Get your ass back here, or I'll cave it in. You got a choice. Either I tear you up any time I feel like it Or we make a date. Let's make a date. I need my sleep. I'll decide the time and place. You know where to get me. What's gonna happen to me if grear wins? That's grear's decision. You mean I don't even have a choice? You've already sold yourself, Collier. From now on, you're just property. How do you like it? You ready? Grear? Come on. [Percussive music] * Oh! [Screams] Ha. Now I'm in my own natural element. Come on down here and fight. Are we finished? Screw you, bitch! Ooh! Well? You're the... Ow! You're the boss. And don't forget you said that. And anyone who's not going with us Better stay our of our way and keep their mouths shut. You have to make up your mind one way or the other. How about you, Collier? Are you in? You bet your ass I am. Ferina? [Cat meows] Okay, I go. How about you, harrad? I do whatever grear does. Grear? How do you figure you're gonna pull it off? To tear down a house of blocks, what do you do? You knock out the main support. And who's the main support in this big doll house? Lucian. And where will you find Lucian completely alone? The hotbox. Shit. All right, now, this is the clip here, And you release it with this little clasp. After you've inserted your fresh clip, You have to feed the first cartridge Into the chamber By pulling back on this little handle right here, Like this. Try it. When it sticks, pull it. That's good. But listen, I want you both to practice every day. I mean, it's got to be almost like second nature with you. - Right. - Okay. Oh, and when this thing goes off, it really goes, So you've got to get a firm stance and hold on, Because it'll jump right out of your hands. I'll show you. All right, butt in the shoulder. [Moaning] Don't worry, baby. I'll get you some stuff tomorrow. Just try to hang on till then. I promise, you hear? Try to get some sleep now. [Whimpers] How is she? She's in terrible shape, man. No shit. What do you think, bodine? I don't think she's gonna make it. How can you eat that slop? I've eaten worse. How worse? A whole lot worse. As worse as this? Listen, alcott, I don't think that's funny. How would you like it if somebody did that to you? All right. Hey, you. Hey! Guards, stop it! Hey! Hey! [Gunshots] [Gunshots] Stand back against the wall! [Women screaming] There will be no more food for 24 hours. Now... I want to know who started this. [Snake hisses] [Gasps] What are you doing, miss grear? Where'd that thing come from? I took it from the jungle today. Isn't it beautiful? It is not happy being a captive. I could have been killed. But if you'd not been snooping in my office, You'd have nothing to fear. I came to get the stuff. I thought maybe you weren't coming back. Sit down. Yesterday your cellmates did a strange and dangerous thing. Do you know why? Me? How should I know? You're sure you have nothing to tell me? Yup. This is good, Because I have no heroin powder for you today. What are you trying to pull? You have no information, I have no heroin powder. Harrad will die if she doesn't get any. She will suffer. She will not die. I always tell you everything I know. Think again. Perhaps there's something you've forgotten. There's going to be an escape. There's always going to be an escape. That's why we have guards. That's all I have to say. Perhaps when you remember more, I will find some heroin powder. [Bells jangling] Come along, Fred. Hi, leyte. Hey. Now, you got my lambanog? Ah, lambanog. Listen, leyte, you ain't gonna believe this, But the old man's still got blowed down in the typhoon. But don't worry. He's putting it all back together. He should have a batch brewed up and aged In about three, four days, and I'll get it for you then. For sure, that's a promise, all right? Fred, let's go. [Bell jangling] Girls, cart is here. Hey, girls, what do you want? When am I gonna get a fix, grear? Keep quiet. Harry's coming. I'll see what I can do. There you go. I don't have any of that. Harry, do you think We're ever gonna get a chance to score in here? What are you complaining about? At least you got a little. Yeah, just about enough to keep me awake at night. [Chuckles] Well, let me tell you something. That's a whole lot better than nothing. Hi, sweet baby. How are you? You want the usual? You wouldn't happen to have some smack stashed in there, Would you? Come on. Cut it out. You ain't serious, are you? Maybe, maybe not. Where's your buddies? They got the day off. [Chuckles] Listen, you want these or don't you? Sure. You got any money? Come here. God damn it, grear. You'd better have the money for that, Or I'm gonna call Lucian. Give me your hand. Isn't that better than money, Harry? That's nice. It's very nice, But it don't replace the real missoula. You want the real missoula, Harry? You can have it. Forget it, Helen. I know you dig girls. I'm not this way because I want to be. It's this place. Pretty soon, a girl gets strange desires, And it creeps up on you like a disease. But it's curable. What does it take? A real man like you. Aw, come on, Helen. Not through the bars. You should be able to get in here at night And steal a key from somebody. Come on, Harry. The guard's coming back. There's someone for Fred too. He can have harrad. Come on. Let go. Tonight, Harry? What do you say? Shit. Fine. It's like a vise. Guard, I forgot to tell you. We really got some great papayas. Are you really serious about this? Would I take this risk if I weren't? What about later on in the week? You're scared. All right. All right, tonight. I think I know a way. Don't forget the hair. When miss Lucian plays weird games, She won't let anybody else have any toys. Make her stay quiet. Ow! What is this, a turkish bath? You won't be laughing soon. In about 72 hours, you're gonna look like a stewed prune. Guards, I'll not be needing you anymore tonight. You may go. Yes, ma'am. Where is that dim-witted animal? [Inaudible] Maybe she couldn't find the cat. Maybe she didn't even try. [Footsteps] I would like to have a private discussion with one of you. We all know what your private discussions are like. I wish to speak with Ms. Collier. I shall open the door. Anyone who moves will be shot. Come forward, Ms. Collier. You see? There's no guard. You were right. She doesn't want any witnesses. Hey, Freddie. Yeah. Is that it? Yep. Our ticket to paradise, Fred. Lambanog. - Lambanog, huh? - Yeah. What's that taste like? Oh, it's all right. Well, I mean, what does it do for you? Oh, some people just really... Yeah? Well... - Is it good, huh? - Hmm. You gonna let me try some of that? - You really want to? - Yeah. Well, Fred, if you're sure that's really what you want do, Why don't you just take a man-sized plug off bottle? All right, I will. But don't let your alligator mouth Override your hummingbird ass. [Coughing] [Laughing] Oh, baby! Got you that time. Come on, Fred. Get on in the truck. Good evening, Alfred. Well, you look like a visitor from another world. Come in. I promised you something special. A toast to a charming hostess And to the two of us In hopes that we'll have a successful evening. Completely successful. I got a special delivery for the supervisor. Oh, her dinner party's arrived. Right, the dinner party. Yeah, that's it, the dinner party. Get inside. [Cat meowing] I've got to have it, Helen. Please? Get some for me. Close up, will you? When we get out of here, You can hit the streets and get all the junk you need. Look, I can't wait that long. I'm sick. I got to have it now. God damn it. Listen, you tawdry bitch. I'm gonna get you out of here, But I can't do it with you yelling your fool head off. Now, forget about getting your crud tonight, Because there's no way! Now shut your filthy mouth. [Crying] You don't want me anymore. You want that Collier bitch. Shut up, will you? I'll get you some stuff tomorrow. You're gonna go away with her And leave me behind. How am I gonna get a fix if you leave me behind? How am I gonna do anything? Aren't you listening to me? Grear! [Crying] You don't give a damn about me, do you? Mm-mm. Oh, I'm only good for lighting your cigarettes And kissing your ass. I'm not pretty enough anymore, am I? I'm just a snail. I don't give a damn about snails. I just step on them. You want to see me dead, don't you? That's it, honey. I got a hunch I'm gonna see you dead first. It is very simple, miss Collier. You tell me about the escape. I release you from this nightmare. Very well, then. The cobra is deadly poisonous. But it still has some way to go before it can reach you. There is still time to make up your mind. The corba's venom attacks the nerve system. The victim dies in convulsions, foaming at the mouth It would be a sad thing For one so young to die so horribly. Bodine! Help, bodine! Please help, bodine! Please help. Stop! Please stop it! Get away! Help! I can't stand it. Cool it, will you? We've got to help her. Where is that goddamn cat? Coming soon. [Bells jangling] Ah, leyte, leyte, my love. How are you tonight? Hey, what are you doing here this time of night? Oh, I got you a surprise. Water. My lambanog. Ha! That's otico special. Otico special. Uh, that's only gonna cost you 200 pesos. What? Well, otico special. I mean, that's the best there is. That's Mountain dew. Fred, you know what the problem is? What's the problem? I think that we ought to let the little lady Taste the otico special Before we start talking about the price. If we only had something to serve it in. Oh! Just so happens that I got a glass right here. You can fill up with the otico special. Now, try a little bit of that, Just... just a little sip. Oh, you're gonna love it. That's really good. Okay. Very nice But not for 200 pesos. Well, that's 'cause you only had one glass. I mean, you got to have another taste, Get all the juices. Better pour some more, will you? Fred, I'm terrible ashamed of myself. I mean, we ain't being gentlemen about this. What I think is that you ought to sit down And have a little drink with the lady, Kind of keep her company. You know what I mean? Of course, certainly. [Cat meows] Alcott. Lucian! Do you hear me? Guards are in the same position as many policemen. They are free to do as they please Unless someone watches them closely. Such people are difficult to supervise, Because they usually watch whoever's watching them. Well, it seems to me that you should take more time To listen to complaints and investigate them. But maybe you aren't disturbed by cruelty. Disturbed? I loathe it. I loathe all inhuman acts. Stop torturing that girl! I'll tell you where the camp is. Quit it, bodine. Shut your mouth. Do you hear me? I'll tell you everything you want to know. [Buzzer buzzing] Excuse me. I must attend to something for a few minutes. Fix yourself a Brandy while I take care of some business. Lucian, listen to me! You won. Shut up, bodine. I'll tell you everything you want to know. [Yells] Open the door, or we'll saw your head off. All right. Ah! [Shrieks] Get him away, please. Take this. And don't you move. Let me at her. I'll kill her. Not now. There's no time. Grab that grease gun. [Footsteps] Come on. [Screams] [Moaning] Dietrich. All the time, it was her down there Watching us squirm. Ferina, get some cloths, and tie them. Up and put a gag in that quack's mouth. Alcott, check for the truck. Sit down. Put your hands behind your back. It's parked where it usually is, Near the trash can. Do you see grear? - No. - Maybe she's hiding. We'd better get moving. Miss alcott, you're making a stupid mistake. Ferina, I thought I told you to gag him. Listen to me. There's a safer way. Let him talk. You give me a chance, and I'll get this prison reformed. I just want out. Don't you want to see things changed for the better? Before you can do anything in here, A lot has to be changed out there. This way, you'll only get killed. Not if we get out of here fast. No noise. Call the guard. [Buzzing] Mm! Hi. I think your boss wants you. She's in there. [Screams] Let's drink up, okay? Whoo! [Laughs] Don't worry, honey. Fred's gonna be here in a minute. Helen? Harry, we better get the hell out of here. Harry. Harry, come on. Now if we can just make it past the gate guard. Guards, there are two of them. What the hell are you doing? Where's grear? She's dead, covered in blood. Who killed her? Harrad, I guess. Do you have something to cover up the back of the truck? Yeah, we got a tarp. All right, that's perfect. Now, you're gonna have some people back there, And you're gonna cover us up And drive out of here like nothing ever happened. Yeah? What's in it for us? You can have miss Dietrich. [Chuckles] Hey, I like that. Oh, that's good, bodine. All right, Harry, get in. You're driving. Now you. Wait a minute. What if we can't make it through the gate? Then we all die trying. Ferina. Collier. Grear? Grear? Where'd you go to? Wait for me. Don't leave me behind! Wait for me. I'm sick. I've got to find grear. How did you get out? Wait. Stop! Grear! Wait for me! I said stop. [Gunshots] Oh! Harrad. We've got Dietrich and Dr. Phillips. Open the gate, or we'll kill them! Wait! It's the supervisor. Don't let them. Open the gate. Tell them to open the gate. Don't do it. Don't let them get away. Kill them! Shoot them! Step on it, Harry. Crash the gate. I can't. It's too strong. Look, you won't die from this bullet, Harry, But you'll wish you had. All right. Let me get a run at it. No! No, come back! Ferina! [Gunfire] Hit it hard, Harry. Get it on! Yee-haw! Can we now, please? Okay. But don't wander too far. [Laughter] What are we gonna do about the doctor? Well, I know what I'd like to do to him, But I don't think we have time. Yeah. We've got to get out of here. Yeah. "My beloved Rafael, I know now "That we will never meet again in this world. "Our life together has been very beautiful, "Even with all the pain and suffering around us. "Some day, when all the exploiters Have been driven from our country..." It's getting pretty light. Well, don't you want the doctor's clothes? I won't need them. Oh, my God. Alcott? Yes, miss Dietrich? Before you die, I want you to know why I despise you. You see, alcott, You take up valuable space. You breathe in clean air, and you eat precious food. And what do you give in return? Disease. You are an infection that must be wiped out. You are impure, degenerate, filth, scum. Go on. [Gun clicking] Gee, I'm sorry. You know something, miss Dietrich? Do you know I used up all those bullets last night? You should have used this one. Ah, I was stupid to think I could make out in this place. You know what I'm gonna do? You tell me. First off, I'm gonna sell the truck. Then I'll gonna go back to the states, Get me a backpack, And go straight on out into the desert. Don't give me that. You'd go nuts without women. Oh, Fred, listen. I was reading in the newspaper, In the foothills somewhere on mohave, They got one of those naked communes. Now, you think about that, boy. Hundreds... i mean hundreds... Of beautiful little girls Just running around bare-assed. And the only guy is you. That's right. As per our agreement when we commandeered your truck, She's all yours. Right here in front of everybody? And hurry. I wouldn't want you to lose your early morning vigor. Uh, Fred, you go first. No, no, that's all right. Don't be shy. Well, I'm not shy. I mean, you're the one that made this deal. I don't want everyone to think I'm being grabby. I'm not going to think you're grabby, so go ahead. Fred. I am giving you the opportunity of a lifetime. Oh, yeah? [Gun cocks] Ah! Ah! Action, big mouth. Ma'am. No. You ain't gonna need that gun. No. No. Hope you're enjoying this, miss Dietrich. No. No! Oh, yeah. Attention! You are all surrounded. Throw down your weapons. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. This is your prison doctor, Dr. Phillips. Marne, this is for Rafael. You've got to get it to him. Now get out of here. That way. Oh, no, bodine. You stupid bitch. Do what you're told. Alcott, give yourself up. You haven't got a chance. I'll stand by you. Bullshit. We've got a gun on Dietrich. You shoot, she's dead. Shoot! Shoot! Don't let her loose. What's wrong, doctor? The supervisor's a very sick woman. She can't be permitted to return to her duties. She's a schizophrenic suffering from severe delusions. You've got to take her into custody. Doctor, I need more than your opinion Before I can arrest the supervisor. There's more proof than you need back at the prison. That's a very accurate diagnosis, doctor. There's only one thing wrong. It applies to you. You're the one that's having delusions. [Chuckles] Wait a minute. Don't you see what she's doing? I know precisely what I'm doing. I'm looking out for the well-being of my staff. Handcuff him. He's dangerous. Bye-bye, lard ass. The few weeks has been too much For someone of his delicate... [Groaning] [Distant motor humming] Hi. Where you headed? Anywhere you want to go. Glad to hear you say that, miss Collier, Because I'm taking you right straight back to prison. We've been looking for you all day. * working by the sea* * get 'em working on them cane fields * * and I'm gonna be free * * and I'm gonna be free * * and I'm gonna be free *
