Every colored actress: Lena Horne, Eartha Kitt, everybody. "Carmen Jones" is the best part for a Negro actress in years. Ever. - Hey, she is Carmen. - [sighs] - You should have seen her run at La Vie en Rose. They were literally handing out the "Kinsey" sex report at the door, she's so hot. - Okay, that was New York, not Hollywood. That was a nightclub and not high drama. And I've seen her last two pictures, and that's all, folks. - Oh, come on, she's been shoved into nothing but banana hats and curled slippers for a year, and you know it, Joey. Now, come on. Joey, just get her a reading with Preminger. That's all I'm asking. - Just a reading? Just Otto Preminger? Do you know what I do every morning, Earl? - No, Joe. - I get up every morning at 5:00 am when it's still dark, and I drive all the way from the Valley to the studio, and along the way, I see faces. Faces on billboards, faces on bench ads. Familiar faces. Famous faces. The faces of movie stars. The faces that I see out of my car window are the faces for whom I get readings with Otto Preminger. And not once, in all my drives, have I ever seen the face of Dorothy Dandridge. Now, good night. [triumphant music] ♪ ♪ [comical echo of triumphant music] ♪ ♪ [distant telephone rings] - I wonder, why did Joey Young decide to get me a reading? - Apparently he saw you from his car window one morning. - [laughs] No kidding? - No kidding. - Mr. Preminger will see you now. - What? - I just realized this is the moment I've always dreamed of. - Your reading with Preminger? - A chance. - Oh... let me handle this, will ya? [door closes loudly] Mr. Preminger? - [sighs] [blows] [pen scratching on paper] - Mr. Preminger, I'd like you to meet Carmen Jones. - Ooh. Ha ha ha. Carmen Jones? No. I will give her a reading for the role of Cindy Lou. - Cindy Lou? Isn't that the sweet girl that gets dumped for Carmen? - There must be a misunderstanding. - 'Scuse me? - I said there must be a misunderstanding. Miss Dandridge is here to read for the part of Carmen. - You have come into my office, but you have not brought Carmen with you. You have brought yourself with you. Good little girl, nice gloves... asking for a reading for the role of a wild woman. You are not Carmen. You're Cindy Lou. Dorothy: But Mister... Earl: Dorothy is an actress, Mr. Preminger. - She is Cindy Lou. - I'm sure if you'd just give her the opportunity... - This is final. [papers rustling] - You know what you are, Mr. Preminger? - [whispers] Dorothy. - You're a bulldog. You're a big, fat bulldog! That's what you are. - What did you call me? - A bulldog. - [laughs nervously] She's...nervous. [stammers] Thank you for your time. Cindy Lou. We'll look at Cindy Lou. Mama: Oh, she's on every page. Look at this! - What part? Who's gonna play this part? I can play this part. They'd never see me, though, would they, Mama? - I'm not going back to read for Cindy Lou. Don't know why you're still lookin' at that. - You should be grateful he's considering you for a part. I couldn't get an audition if I tried. - I don't want to be Cindy Lou. Mama: So that's what you gonna do? Just give up? - He won't give me a chance, Mama. - Well, if you're waitin' for them to give you a chance, you're gonna have a hard row to hoe. Honey, you have got to take your chances. Now, you think about Carmen. This girl is all about sex. She looks like sex. She smells like sex. She even moves, you know, she moves like sex. - Mm-hmm, that's the way. Use the equipment Mama gave you. You got to walk in there like Carmen. - But that old bulldog won't even let me read for Carmen. - Honey, we're not talkin' 'bout readin'. We're talkin' 'bout walkin'. - [laughing] Now, you can get this part. - By walkin'. [all laugh] Dorothy: Have you seen my man? That Carmen Jones snatched him from me, and I'm lost over what to do about it. Can't decide if it's better me follow him up to the Windy City... Or should I wait... For him to come back to his happy hearth and home? Tell me what to do. I'm Cindy Lou. - The hell you are. - [chuckles] - [chuckles] - Girl, I was Carmen. "Miss Dandridge, can I get you this?" "Miss Dandridge, can I get you that?" Remember, they hired that opera singer to come do my movie singin' for me? [giggling] Mm-hmm. They did. [chuckles] Then one morning I woke up, and I just couldn't breathe. - What are you telling me? She won't make the picture? I start shooting tomorrow! Wonderful! Where is she? - She won't do it. I've talked to her three times. She won't do it. She doesn't want to anger the Negro community. - "Anger the Negro community." That's ridiculous! The first all-Negro film! First released by a major studio! - Yes, in which she plays a Negro whore. - It's not a whore! It's a woman, not a whore. - Otto, Otto. A critic suggested that Hollywood depicts all Negro women as either mammies or prostitutes. - Yeah, but this is... it confuse me. First the studio won't approve the film because it's all-Negro. Then they will do the film, but only if the NAACP also approves. Now Miss Dandridge won't make the film because even though the NAACP and the studio approve... one man who writes one article does not. She's scared, yes? - Yeah. Terrified. Otto. You're not really the asshole you seem to be, are you? - This, little gentleman, is something neither you nor anyone else will ever know. [two short knocks on door] - Earl, go away! I've already made up my mind! Otto: It's not Earl. Open. Miss Dandridge. - Call me Dorothy. Most...directors that barge in my house usually do. - You decline to play Carmen? - I've already proven I could get the part. No real reason for me to play it. - Hmm. Maybe you are not good enough to play the role. Maybe you have no talent. - I've got more talent than anybody in this town. You won't find a better Carmen than me. - So, you know you can do it, I know you can do it. That's not your fear. It's the gamble. - What would you know about that? - I, too, am taking big gambles on this picture. If it doesn't work, then everybody will say Otto Preminger is a fool thinking he can make a all-Negro musical. And if I succeed, then I will be a genius. [chuckles] You know how I know it will work? Because I have my Carmen. I have you. - What if they don't like me? - They will love you. I will make them love you. I may be a...old bulldog, with a bald head, but this is what I can do. - I didn't mean to say that. - No, no. It's all right. I know I'm ugly. My gift is to bring the beauty to the world. I know women. I know how to light them, to shoot them, to create them for the screen. And if you let me, I will seduce the audience for you.
