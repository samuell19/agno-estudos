Well, I worked here for 15 years, right up until this place closed down. Why hide out in an old battery factory? He's a creature of habit. I don't know. I still think he's in another state by now. Hey, have I ever been wrong? [Chuckles] Ok, ok. Check this out. It could be any homeless guy. Bingo. That's the same brand that Miller had at his apartment. Food's still warm. [Clink of metal] Ok. Please... [Gun shot] [Struggling] [Gun shots] Ah, dammit! You hit? No, I'm not hit but I think I dislocated my knee. No! Stacey, call for back up! [Sobbing] Lower the gun. She's so pure. I can't have a girl this pure grow up in a world like this! Drop it. Stacey... You know what's coming. [Gun shot] No! NO! No- Stacey! Hey! [Screaming] Hey! It's ok, wake up! Wake up! It's a nightmare. You're having a nightmare! Hey! Hey. Hey. Shh. [Gasping] It's ok. It's ok. Stacey, come on. Come here. Come here. You're alright. You're alright. I tried to save her. I couldn't. Mom? She's ok, go back to bed. Sarah, sweetie? Take your brother back to the bedroom. Go on. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come here, come here, come here. It's ok. Come on. It's ok, you're here. It's good. It was different this time, Jack. Miller called me by my name. He has never done that before. Maybe it's um... part of the healing process. God, I just wish it would stop. It will. Hey. It will. [breathing] Focus. Focus. Why can't she be like normal mothers? She is normal. Why do you say stuff like that? None of my friends have mothers that get into gun fights. Duh. You stop that. Your mother is a fine police officer. You should be proud of her. I wish she never goes back to work. You said her new medication would stop the nightmares but it's not happening. Maybe she needs to see another shrink. Sarah. Psychiatrists, you know, get a second opinion. She doesn't need a second opinion. She's getting better. Last night was the first one in at least three weeks. Eighteen nights. You keep track? Yeah. They scare me. What scares you, bud? Nothing. Alright, gather up your stuff, I'll drive you to school. Come on. I scared him last night, didn't I? Yeah, but he's a tough nut, he'll be ok. Maybe I should drive them. I can talk to Matt, ease his mind. You stay. Enjoy your breakfast. I'll call you when I get to the office. Hey guys, you forgot your lunches. I hate this. I know. I want to go back to work. I know. Parole hearings are stressful, Martha. You handled yourself very well. I'm glad you were there. It was my pleasure. Four years is a long time, but this is a new beginning. If you continue down the path that you are on, you will find the guilt and the grief easier to live with. You will find peace, Martha. I know you will. Thank you. For all your help. You're welcome. If all of my patients were as committed and determined as you have been my life would be a lot easier. There's my card. I hope you'll stay in touch. That's it? That's it. You'll be out this afternoon. Thank you. [Chanting] Murder is murderer! Murder is murderer! Ok, we good? Yeah? Cameras on, mics are on. Check, check. How are my levels? Check, check, one, two. Ok, let's move ahead. How do I look? Is this a good frame here? Got it? Ready in three, two... [TV] After serving only four years for the death of Walter Bordel, the infamous Martha Dixel is being released from prison. Bordel was charged with the fatal crash that claimed the lives of Dixel's husband and 12 year old daughter. Taking the law in her own hands in what some described as fair justice for a grieving mother, Dixel intentionally ran down and killed Bordel outside his apartment building. The controversial trial ended with the verdict of voluntary manslaughter. As you can see, there is a large group of protesters here today and they are not happy with her early release. She's getting in a squad car to be taken out of here safely. [Crowd yelling at Martha] You can see a lot of people protesting with the signs. They are not happy about Dixel's release. This is Daniel Sarlan reporting live from St. Catherine's prison. Hey. Hey. I feel like I've aged ten years. You're beautiful. You're only saying that because you have to. I'll try Botox. You're afraid of needles. Might be worth it. Will you still love me when I look like a prune? Nah. Come to bed. I talked to John today. How is he? He's good. Busy. I told him that I want to go back to work. Stacey, we've talked about this. Mmmhmm. It's too soon. Well, I spoke with Dr. Graham this afternoon and she ok'd it. And Riley said I could come back part time and see how it goes. You have been busy. But that's just the point, Jack. I haven't been. I am bored out of my skull here. I have to get back- I need to get back to work. Sounds like you've made up your mind. I have. [Cheering and applause] Ok, ok. Let's not get carried away. Thank you for stopping that. Hey, standing ovations are for movie stars and presidents, not for hard-working detectives like us. Since when do you work hard? Oh, ouch. [Chuckles] You're knee is ok? As long as I don't have to run any marathons. Tipping? Surprised you're back. Hey, Garcia. Nice to see you both. Some things never change. He took a liking to your job and I don't think he wants to give it back. What's he like to work with? He's an ok cop, but a lousy partner. Glad you're back. Barker. Paperwork. We don't have all day. Garcia? Yep. You're not paid to stand around. Welcome back. Thank you. Come on, let's get you caught up. [Knocked to the ground] Are you ok? Oh my god, I didn't mean to- [Groaning] I didn't mean to hit you, I didn't see you. I didn't see you. Are you ok? I'm fine. You ain't fine. You ain't fine, maybe you should sit down. Maybe you should sit down. Hey, hey. I'll call an ambulance. I'm fine. Ok, yeah, yeah. You just sit right there. Just sit right there. Call the ambula- Hey! What's going on? Hey! Hey, hey, that's my van. Hey, that's- that's my van! That's my van! When you're done with these files I got a patrol car out back that needs waxing. You should have been a comedian. Maybe I should. You two jokers, you give me a lot of material. Got a lead on the Klein case? Oh, sorry. Old habits. That's ok. Can I help you? Who are you? What are you doing in my house? I think you have the wrong address. I know my house, and this is it. Where's all my stuff? Where is she? What did you do with Anna? Ben?! Ben! Where are you?! Listen to me. There's no Ben or Anna here. We've been renting this place for four years. I can call the landlord if you want. No. This isn't right. Momma's gonna find you, baby. Momma's gonna find you. No speeding, no joy riding, and no boys in the car. Mom, lighten up. We're just going to a barbecue. With a three week old driver's license. Don't worry, Mrs. Tipping, I'll take care of her. That's what I'm worried about, Jennifer. Ease up, Stacey, they're gonna be fine. Thank you, dad. Your mother is way too intense. Tell me about it. So are you gonna talk to Brody or are you just gonna stand around looking stupid? Don't you dare say anything to him about me. Earth to Sarah, he's interested. You need to make your move, girlfriend. Ok, I get the point. [Loud music] What?! I get the point! [Laughs] [Revs engine] Woo! Hey bud, can we talk for a minute? Matthew. Can we talk? Yeah, sure. Wait, this isn't the sex talk, is it? No, this isn't the sex talk. Good, 'cause dad keeps talking to me about it. He thinks that now that I'm eleven I'm going to turn into a pervert or something. [Laughs] Oh, honey. No, he doesn't. But do you want me to tell him to lay off? It's ok, he gets embarrassed when talking about it, and it's funny. I wanted to talk to you about the nightmares. 'Cause I know that they scare you. I don't like it when you scream. I know. Dr. Graham calls them an emotional response to a traumatic event and she's helping me to understand them. You're getting better, right? Yes, I am. Much better. Good. Yeah? I love you, Matt. I love you, too, mom. [Rock music] ♪♪♪ I'm good, how are you? You sure you want to take a walk? Your friend is going for the burger binge record. Trust me, you don't want to be there for that. After five burgers, Brendan goes volcanic. That's so gross. I know. Want to go check out the park? Sure. Anna? I'm glad you're here. Really? Yeah. I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time. Why didn't you? Didn't think you were interested. That's funny. Why? I didn't think you were interested, either. What the hell are you doing? I'm just spying on love birds. That wasn't funny. Temper, temper. Anna, I'm taking you home. Excuse me? We're leaving. I'm not Anna. No games. Stop fooling around. We don't want any trouble, lady. I think you should leave. I've been looking for you for hours, sweetheart. We still have to find your father. I'm calling the police. Give me the phone. Why are you doing this to me? I'm... I'm- I'm not doing anything. Please. I'm not Anna. Look. Be cool. We'll help you find her. Shut the hell up! Tape him up. Tape him up! Sorry. You're coming with me. Now. How did your talk with Matt go? It was good. It was easier than I thought. Yeah? Yeah. Our little boy is growing up, Jack. Too quickly. Yeah. He told me about your sex talks. He did? What did he say? Oh, he quite likes them. Likes them? He's not supposed to like them. That's kind of twisted, isn't it? I'm kidding. Well, uh... since you're in a good mood, I just think maybe it's time you... changed jobs. You know, I'm not saying leave the department, just not be a detective anymore. You're talking about a desk job? No, no I'm not. I was thinking community work, like a beat cop. I spent the past ten years busting my butt to become detective. I like my job. Well, I don't. And neither do our kids. What are you saying? What? Your nightmares. You're screaming, you're crying, you're falling to pieces- I'm not damaged goods. I don't- We can't go through this! Stacey! [Sobbing] [Sobbing] Please, baby, stop crying. Ah, thank you. Keep the change. There you go, that's yours. Thank you. Why is he so damn overprotective? He's a guy. We're all overprotective. He wants me to transfer over to community service. Go back to the bottom of the ladder. Ouch. Hey, you didn't hurt him, did you? [Laughs] No, but I wanted to. I bet. I don't know, you think he's right? I don't know. Maybe he's right, maybe he's wrong. Thanks for the help. Stacey, I can't give you advice on this. This is between you, Jack, and the kids. I know. But this is who I am. Yeah, well, this is who I am. But after 30 years I'm thinking of a change. What are you talking about? I'm thinking about retiring next year. What? Why would you do that? Lisa wants to move to Florida. She wants me to help Bill out with the fish and chips shop. You? With a deep fryer? [Laughs] Yeah, well... change is good. Especially after all these knees have been through. Besides, it'll be great for the kids to get to know their grandpa while he can still wipe his own butt. [Phone rings] Yeah, hey Riley, what's up? What? Where? Yeah, we'll be right there. It's Sarah. Let's get to Queen's Park [Sirens wailing] Help me out here. We need to find your dad. [Sirens wailing] What happened? Tell me exactly what happened. Easy, Stacey. I'm sorry, Mrs. Tipping. She had a gun, she tied us up, we couldn't stop her. Who was she? Stop crying! Who was she? [Sobbing] I don't know! We have a description of the vehicle, ok? Jennifer and Brody, they gave us a good description of the woman- Brody, the kid throwing the barbecue? I'm sorry, Mrs. Tipping. What the hell were you two doing here?! Hanging out. We just wanted to talk. What's the description? It's uh... medium build, blondish hair, forty-something. She grabbed the cell phone- Stacey! Someone took our baby. You're sure it's Sarah? Yes. Issue an Amber Alert and I want prints off that cell. We will. You two should head home, ok? No, I am not leaving. We're gonna call you- This is my job, I'm not leaving! Stacey, he's right. You and Jack should go home- This is Sarah! I know! Look, you're in no condition to help us now, this is too personal. Jack, please. Watch him. Find her. Matt's asleep on our bed. Jennifer was always a bad influence, Sarah never would have gone to that party if she hadn't convinced her. Jennifer is a good kid. We've known her since she was four. It's not her fault. What if she's sold into prostitution? What if this woman jacks her up on drugs? What if we never see her again? Stop. [Sobbing] We'll find her. [Phone ringing] Yeah? Did you find Sarah? They matched the prints. They know who took her. We've ID'd our suspect as one Martha Dixel. Three days ago she was released from the St. Catherine's Women's Correctional Facility after serving four years for involuntary manslaughter. In 2010 her husband and daughter were killed by a drunk driver, one Walter Bordel. She chased him down, pinned him against a wall with her car, crushed him to death. How did she get parole? She was a model prisoner. She came through every program they threw at her with flying colours. Aced her final psych evaluation. What made her flip out? Once a nut job, always a nut job. I'd like to thank the off-duty officers for coming in on such short notice. As we're all aware, time is of the essence. Be sharp, people. Martha Dixel is armed and dangerous. One final note: Sarah is one of ours. We'll bring her home safely. Like I said: once a nut job, always a nut job. Shut up, Barker. I want to work this case. You're the mother of the victim. You know department policy. Even if I could make an exception I need rational thinking and I don't think you're capable of that. I can think rationally. I will think rationally. You've also been on PTS leave for the past three months. I have to take that into consideration. And that happens to good cops all the time. They heal and they come back to work. I've been the head of the child abduction unit for seven years. I'm the best you have and you know it. Of course I know it. But Stacey- We don't have time! Please. Don't make me stay at home doing nothing. You take your orders from Barker. Barker is point. You take your orders from him. Thank you. Yeah. Barker, get in here. What is going on? Where's Matthew? He's at my sister's. I'm going to be joining them there. Ok, no. Hold on. We did not discuss this. Sarah is my daughter, too. She's Matthew's sister. We are all in this together, Stacey, all of us, not just you. What are you talking about? We need to support each other. I'm here. You're at work. Yeah, I am trying to find Sarah. You haven't listened to a damn thing I've said. I need to find Sarah, Jack. There's an entire police force looking for our daughter! Yeah, and I am the best child abduction officer on the force. If anyone can find her, I can. Matt and I can't stay here alone worrying about Sarah and worrying about you. Hey, sleepyhead. Remember this one? [Singing] ♪ Anna, Anna, ♪ caught a trout, daddy turned it inside out. ♪ ♪ Mommy fried it good and hot, ♪ ♪ Anna ate it on the spot. ♪ Yum yum. ♪ Yum yum. ♪ Anna, Anna, caught a trout, ♪ ♪ daddy turned it inside out. ♪ ♪ Mommy fried it good and hot ♪ ♪ and Anna ate it on the spot. ♪ Yum yum. So Dr. Collier, you say it here that Martha is not psychotic. Martha underwent a series of tests to determine whether or not she was harbouring a psychosis and she wasn't. Well, obviously people can cheat in those tests. No. Are you sure about that, doc? Yes, I'm quite sure, detective. Martha was suffering from a psychological trauma caused by a horrible accident that killed her husband and her daughter. Once she started coping with her grief she embraced the healing process. I would not have recommended her for parole if I had any thought that she might be a safety risk. She kidnapped my daughter! I didn't know Sarah is your daughter. I'm so sorry. Thank you, doc. I know you're not sleeping, Anna, you're not fooling anyone. [Radio] The search for Sarah Tipping continues. The sixteen year old was taken Saturday afternoon by gunpoint by a woman who eyewitnesses describe as blonde, mid-forties, and- You don't worry, sweetheart. I wouldn't let anyone ever hurt you. Please, let me go. I'll find my way back. Stop it! Stop saying that! I can't think straight when you don't make any sense. I want to go home. I want to go home! Please! Shut up! Just shut the hell up! So how are Jack and Matthew holding up? Jack took Matthew to his sister's house. He seems to think she can support him better than I can. Is he right? That's not funny, Garcia. Stace, it's just... It's just what? It's just, I don't know, maybe Sarah's abduction is gonna trigger your PTS. Oh, what, you're a psychiatrist now? [telephone ringing in distance] Peace offering? Garcia? Yeah. Can I have a minute? Sure. So what's up? How did it go with Dr. Collier? You got the report. I'm done with Tipping, ok? How did she handle it? You want to know how she handled it, you go ask her yourself. The captain was wrong, she should not be on this case. Are you done? You know you know as well as I do, right now she's her daughter's worst enemy. Focus, focus, focus, focus! When we find Ben, we're going to head to the cabin. He's gonna take you fishing. You know how you like fishing? And we'll go swimming, and we're gonna roast hot dogs just like we used to. It's gonna be really fun. Who's Ben? He's your dad, silly. He's not my dad! Don't make me hurt you! Don't make me hurt you! [Door opens] What are you doing? [Door closes] [Screams] Found something. An auto theft report. A woman matching Martha's description got hit by a van owned by a Calvin Short, and while he was calling for an ambulance, she drove off in his van. Garcia, you and Tipping pay Mr. Short a visit, ok? Address? Got it. Ok, let's go, partner. I'm still mad at you. Stay down and don't move. You got any hot chocolate? Nope. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Yeah. Thank you. Do you want a receipt? No, thanks. They were out of hot chocolate, sorry. Oh geez, you gotta be kidding me. I've never had a speeding ticket, let alone hit anyone or anything. Let's focus on what happened. I was backing up and I heard a thump. I jumped out and I found her lying there. It wasn't a hard hit because she picked herself up pretty quick. I'll never forget the look on her face. Tell me about that look. It wasn't shock or pain. She had these big, terrified eyes looking straight through me. And then? She got up. She was all disoriented, I told her to sit down and she did, in my van, and then she drove off in it, just like that. They find it yet? Uh, no, not yet. Did she say anything? Anything at all? She said she was fine. Anything else? She was confused, like maybe she had a concussion. Thank you, Mr. Short. Just so you know, we don't think you hurt her when you hit her. Yeah, I pretty much figured that out when she stole my van. Being hit by that van brought back the trauma of her losing her daughter and her husband. You think that caused some kind of relapse? No, I know it did. [Phone ringing] Garcia. Thanks. Martha surfaced at a gas station out in Edgeweir. Sarah? Clerk didn't see her. This isn't good, Ben. I don't know where you are, and I don't know what to do. No, nothing yet. Thanks. What'd she say? Martha did have a photograph in her cell. Her husband and daughter. Anna had long blonde hair. Like Sarah. Hey, uh... when we get to the gas station, Barker's already there. Be cool. What, you think I'm gonna fly off the handle? No, it's just... What? Captain Riley is worried, that's all. He told Barker to keep you busy. He what? Yeah, so one word from Barker and the captain will take you off the case, so be cool. I didn't see... she was alone. She was alone? There's nothing else? Um... no... well, she uh... she wanted hot chocolate, but we're out. Uh, did you see a girl, about this tall, blonde. Uh, no, there was no one with her. Did you check the security tapes? Camera doesn't work. It's all for show. What kind of car was she driving? It was the van, ok? Um, you know what? I got this covered, so you and Garcia, why don't you knock on some doors? I'm not finished here. Yeah, you are. Garcia, could you please- You know, what the hell is your problem?! Stacey, come on. Huh? I'm not the one yelling. Calm down. I'm in the middle of an interview with a witness, thank you. Come on. Who's side are you on? Calm down! He's playing you! He wants you to get angry. He's just looking for an excuse to send you home. There is no sign of Sarah. No. But Martha did ask for a hot chocolate. So was she in the car? Or did Martha take her somewhere? Well, she filled up the gas tank, so she's probably still on the move. Yeah, but where?! Stace, she's not in her right mind! She probably doesn't know where she's going. But as long as they're still on the move then they'll be easier to find. Ok, come on. Matt, what are you doing? I thought I told you not to leave Aunt Shirley's. Matthew? I am talking to you. I want a picture of Sarah. Just leave it in the frame, we'll take it with us. No! Just leave me alone! They're gonna find her, buddy. They're gonna bring her home safe and sound. You're treating me like I'm six. I know a crazy woman kidnapped her and is going to kill her! No! That's not going to happen. Don't say that. She's coming home, she's going to be fine! How do you know?! You're not looking for her! You don't want mom looking for her! How do you know?! How?! You don't know! It's ok. It's ok. [sobbing] I'm scared, dad. I'm really scared. Me too, son. Me too, son. The search for Sarah continues. Sarah was abducted Saturday afternoon from a small park near Fifth and Ash. Martha Dixel, 40, is a prime suspect in this abduction. If you know her whereabouts, contact police immediately. She is armed and considered dangerous. Do not approach her. Michael, turn on the news. It's that woman I told you about. Stop looking at me like that! I can't think straight anymore! Go up. This is fine. Sit. You don't want to be with me? Fine. Stop it, stop it. Anna, stop it. I wasn't going to leave you up there. I just... I just needed to teach you a lesson. Scare you a little. I would never, ever hurt you. I'm sorry. You are? Yes, I'm sorry. Anna, I love you, sweetheart. I know, I love you too, mom. I know where your father is. Where? He's waiting for us at the cabin. Oh, sweetie, I love you. I love you. You have visitors. Matty. What are you doing here? We want to help. Does dad know you're here? No. Matthew phoned me with a great idea. I phoned Brody. We made these and we want to put them up around town. Please say yes, mom. I need to help, Mrs. Tipping. I feel like this is all my fault. Oh, Brody, this is not your fault. This is nobody's fault. Why didn't you tell your dad? He doesn't want me to go out of Aunt Shirley's house. He's afraid something bad is gonna happen to me, too. [Phone ringing] It's your dad. Hey. Stacey, I can't find Matthew. I've looked everywhere. It's ok, he's here at the station with me. I told him to stay with Shirley. These are difficult times for everyone, Jack. Jack? I'm here. The kids made up missing flyers for Sarah. Ok, I'll be there in five. Thank you. Stace. They spotted the van. It's heading north on Highway 12 up near Pipestone. There's a maze of roads up there. I know. They've called in every available officer. We gotta go. Ok guys, this was a great idea. Stay here and dad is on his way. [Sirens wailing] Get in the back. What're you going to do? Just get on the floor and stay down. [sirens wailing] Looks like they've stopped. Requesting back up. Exit the vehicle with your hands on your head! I'm sorry officer, there seems to be a misunderstanding. On the ground with your hands on your head now! Sir, I'm sorry, I- [Gun shot] [Gun shot] You killed him. It was self defense. He was trying to take you away. He was going to arrest me. And then I would go back to prison. I wouldn't see you for a really long time and I can't go through that again. I can't. I know, mom. You ok? Stace. Yeah. He was young. Yeah. He was only three months out of the academy. Where was his partner? Left early. Sprained his ankle running after a guy. I know how she did it. How she did what? How she passed the psych evaluation. Ok, I'm all ears. She was an exercise fanatic. So? So the body produces noropenepherine during exercise. It acts as a stress buffer. That is why the psychiatrist thought she was stable. Yeah, well she's not so stable now. Oh, I'm sorry Stace. Hi. Do you have a rest room? Yeah, it's right back there. Do you have any fruit? No. You ok? You don't look so good. Yeah. I'm fighting a migraine. Migraine. Yeah, I've got one of those. You got something to take for it? Yeah. That's good. There's nothing like a migraine. Ready to roll? Yeah. Can I grab a soda? Sure. How much? How much? $22.17. Take it. Do you have a car? Yeah. Is it filled with gas? I think so. Please. Mom. I don't want trouble. Neither do we. Just give me your keys. Anna, grab the money from the till. Go. I'm sorry. Put it in the bag. Don't make any phone calls. Let's go. Patty Hearst. Stockholm syndrome. Oh, come on, Barker. Maybe she's just playing with her. No, she apologized to the clerk. She's just waiting for a chance to escape. If Sarah's playing head games, she's way out of her league and her chances of survival have significantly dropped. You don't think I know that? I'm just saying. Remember the cabin? Yeah. Yeah, we uh... had a lot of fun there. We did, didn't we? We sure did. I remember once we were fishing. Your dad and I caught a couple of real nice trout. You were sad because you didn't get a nibble. You cried all the way back to the cabin. Remember that? A little bit. That night there was a lot of splashing down by the boat. We thought someone was trying to steal it. Your dad told us to hang tight, went to investigate, turns out it was your rod hanging off the side of the boat. You reeled it in and it was the biggest fish we ever saw. We were so proud. We ate it for breakfast. You ate so much you almost puked. I... I remember. I have to go to the bathroom. You just went an hour ago. Can't you hold it? We're almost there. I drank too much soda. I have to go, bad. Ok, make it quick. Anna, are you done? We gotta roll. Anna? Hey. Hey, Anna? [Groans] [Struggling] Open the door. Why? I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna smash this window. [Gun shot] [Screams] I'm- I'm not your daughter, my father's name is Jack Tipping, my mother's name is Stacey! What's that? Martha's record from St. Catherine's. We're missing something. Here's photos from the original crime scene. Hey. [Whistles] Sharks are circling. I need someone to talk to that reporter. Give them something to keep the momentum going. You know what might be good? Let the public see the worried mother, you know? No, I really don't think that's a very good idea. I can do it. Ok then. Hey. Keep it simple. Stay calm. Ok? Money on the table says she's gonna blow it. What is your problem? She is. But not for long. You are a real dick, you know that, Barker? Ship's going down, Garcia. Might want to think- Just stop talking! Detective Tipping. So, you gonna do the interview? Yeah. Perfect. The worried mother. You blindside me, you'll regret it. Yikes. Can I quote you on that? I mean it. I'm joking. I know. It's gonna be fine. Ok, let's go boys. [clears throat] Ready? Ok, ready? In five, four, three... This is Daniel Sarlan reporting from police headquarters. I'm here with Detective Tipping, Sarah's mom and incredibly also one of the detectives on her daughter's abduction case. Detective Tipping, three months ago you were involved in another abduction case that ended in tragedy. What makes you think this case is gonna be any different? Is that your comment, detective? Detective, any comments? Oh yeah, I have a few more comments for you. One more question! Looks like she got nasty out there. This is my family. This is not a game. You set me up! Yeah, maybe I did. I want you off my team. [Groans] What the hell is going on? She attacked me. In my office, now. Hey, give me a hand. You might want to put some ice on that. [Coughing] What were you thinking? Oh, come on. He had it coming. No, he didn't. You assaulted a fellow officer. He can press charges. You're suspended until further notice. John. Go home. Your family needs you. One last thing. I need your gun and your badge. Jack. Garcia told me about what happened. Why don't you let me take you home? You were right, Jack. About what? I wasn't ready to go back to work. All I did was make things worse. And if anything happens to Sarah, it's all my fault. It's not your fault, Stacey. Yeah, it is. Matt and Sarah needed a mom. They needed me to be there. You needed me to be there. I've never been more proud of you. I was hard on her, Jack. I should have hugged her more, and told her how much I loved her. Sarah knows you love her. She knows. Come on, let's go home. Hey. We're gonna put these up around town. You gonna be alright? I'm fine. I'm glad you're home, mom. Me too, Matt. Let's go. I love you. Where did you take her, Martha? Come on, how do I get into your head? [Phone ringing] Hey, how are you doing? Uh, I need a favour. Sure, anything. Did Barker interview that woman that Maratha befriended at St. Catherine's? Kate, Kate uh... something or other? Yeah, he thought she was useless. Why? Send me her address. And let's keep Barker out of this, ok? Sure, it'll take me a minute, though. Thanks. I owe you one. [Muffled rock music] [Knocking] Who is it? Kate Kedsey? Who wants to know? I'm Detective Tipping, and I had a few questions about Martha Dixel. I already talked to the police. No, I understand, I just wanted to ask you a few more questions. [fighting grunts] Let's you and I have a talk. Who's the creep with the bat? My boyfriend. It's time to get a new one. Why aren't you booking me? Because I told you I had a few questions. So I ain't being charged? That depends on you. You and Martha were friends at St. Catherine's, right? She had my back, I had hers. Yeah, well she's in trouble, Kate. And I need your help to find her. Look, like I told the other cop, I haven't talked to her since I got out. I know that. Has she ever said anything about a fishing trip? Family vacation? Weekends away? Anything? Not that I recall. Ok, I need your help here, Kate. I do remember something. My ex and me used to be commercial fishermen. Made good money until he lost his fingers in a winch. Anyways, I was uh... telling Martha about it and she said she and her husband once stocked a lake with trout. Did it for the kid. Where, where is this lake? A couple hours north of the city. They camped there or maybe they had a cabin. She said it was beautiful, very remote. Well, today is your lucky day, Kate. Hey, you got a gun I can borrow? Dixel. A cabin north of Pipestone. We have confirmed it, there is a cabin. Thank you. Thank you so much. Call Garcia. Did you talk to Kate Kedsey? Yeah, I talked to her. Where are you? What's going on? I'm heading north on Highway 129. Martha's husband had a cabin on the north side of Turtle Lake. I need backup. Stace, wait until we get there. I'm on my way. I need a helicopter and search party at the north side of Turtle Lake. You're not her. Ben's not coming back. And I am not going back to prison. What did you say your name was again? Sarah Tipping. I'm sorry, Sarah. You have to die. [Gun shots] [Gun shots] Stay here. Get down! [Gun shot] [Gun shots] Martha? I know why you took Sarah. Martha? I just want to talk. You don't know anything! I know that she looks like Anna, and you want to believe that she and Ben are alive. I'm sorry Martha, but they're not. I know this has been confusing. Martha, I understand what you're going through. [Struggles] [Choking] [Groans] Martha, you don't have to do this. Yes, I do. Mom! Are you ok? Yeah. Sarah! Oh my god. I knew you'd bring her home, mom. Are you two ok? Yeah, we both are.
