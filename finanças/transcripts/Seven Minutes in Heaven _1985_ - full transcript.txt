Imagine owning this thing with a will of its own. Don't you think about it constantly? Actually, Polly, no. It's weird. It stands right up. Isn't it amazing? I can't imagine having one. Keep your voice down. Don't forget to mail the check to Ohio Bell. Dad, it might get cold. Which of these sweaters do you like? I don't know. Choose one for me. Okay. Hello! What's wrong? Are you embarrassed? Hey, Mr. Becker, meet my new friend, Mr. Pecker! Ha ha ha! Polly! Tangent. It's tangent. If we know "A", we know what "X" is. Maybe you know what "X" is. Look, Jeff, if "A" is 37, what's "X"? "X" is how I sign my name. Duh! Duh! Gerry, it's almost time for dinner. He's not leaving. What's "X"? Ultraviolet rays. You just lost dinner. What's "X"? A dirty movie? No learner's permit. How do you like them apples? 360 minus 37. Too late. You can forget about driving. That's not fair! Life's tough, buddy. Mom! Can't you get him off my case? Gerry says I can't get my learner's permit. You're part of the family. While you live here, you have to respect Gerry and me. He's not eating with us. I don't want to see his face. You won't see my face... Ever again! [Baby cries] That was smart. Hey, what's up? Not much. Have you seen Polly? No. Cheer up. You're lucky. Yeah. Keep the doors locked. Thanks, Polly. You don't have to be alone. Aunt Gail has a room for you. Polly, I forgot to tell you. Your mother called. Dad, I wish you didn't have to go. Natalie, why are you being so stubborn? Why won't you stay with your aunt Gail? Because I live here. Polly's father was a sales rep until he asked for a new position. That's a different line of work. To win that future leaders contest, I have to really concentrate. Mmm. Great car. Big hands. Ridiculous. Need new points and plugs. I love you. The United States government has told South Africa it is deeply disturbed over recent violence which has taken 26 lives. 300 people have been injured... [Doorbell rings] [Ring] [Ring] [Ring] Hmmm. What happened? Did you and your mom fight? Parents and kids always fight. It's the way of the world. He's not my parent. Adults and kids often fight. He's no adult, either. He threatens, he tries to bully me, he insists that I be like him. I'm not living there anymore. Don't get too comfortable. I can cook. You won't get the chance. You're leaving.

He sees me with Jimmy, and he looks crushed. The music is great. The lead singer is so gorgeous. At first, I think it's my imagination. Then there's no mistaking it. The lead singer keeps looking at me. We'll have some pizza. I know we had it... Look! There's Zoo Knudsen! Who? Don't you know anything about baseball? His sister lives on Grove.

He does underwear commercials. See you. Hi! Wow! Cotton candy! Where did you get that? In there. Can I have some? Sure. Mmm. Looks good. Can I have some? Mmm. You're delicious. What's your name?

I could find a bra that a guy might like, but for the most part... Hey, that's kind of nice. It's not bad. Ha ha ha! If I only had something to fill it. What's it going to be, dear? This one, if you like it. This is nice. I think this will be all. 90! 90! 31! 31! Hut 1! [Whistle blows] It's getting ridiculous. He's living with a friend. I feel like the fastest way to get him back home is to take him off the team. I know he's important. Yes, he is. Jeff? I got kicked off the team. I was thinking of getting steak tonight. Is that okay.? Yeah, steak. Great. Fine. Nat. Yeah? Steak. Thanks a lot. I mean it. I can kiss you. Yuck. How old are you? Could I get arrested? Fif... I mean 18. All right. Everything all right in there? Yeah. I haven't made out like that since I was a sophomore at Fayette High. When will I see you again? We've got Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and then we're back in New York. New York. Can I come? Sure. When you get to the stadium, tell them you're my friend. His arms were like rocks and the door handle was killing me, but it was a wonderful pain.

Saying I love you and I'm counting the minutes. Not if you mean it. Really. You're such a good friend. I have something for you. Chocolate. It takes the place of love. Really. I read it. It affects your brain cells the same way love does. I guess people think it's strange, you two living together. People can think what they want to think. My mom taught me that. I never saw it that way. Ahem. You know, you're really different from other girls. You take things much more seriously. At first, it kind of turned me off. I thought you were uptight or something. No, you haven't heard the good part yet. What's the good part? One day I saw you smile, and it really knocked me out. Your smile. It's like the sun breaking over a gray day. My face is like a gray day? Oh, no, no, no. Your face is beautiful. Your eyes are beautiful, but... It was always... Overcast. Look, Natalie, I go out with a lot of girls. I mean, I'm not a monogamous type guy on the whole, but... Well, you're different. You're something else. What am I? Well, I just told you. Ahem. I have to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. Okay? I can't watch this. I can. Oh, disgusting! [Beep beep] Hello. Help me. I'm failing. I'm doing a terrible job. Don't panic. Let go! We were sitting and talking. He was saying everything he liked about me. Suddenly, it got really weird. How do you mean? Like, kinky? No. Awkward... Uncomfortable. I said I was going to the bathroom. He said she was beautiful, then it got awkward. What should she do? She said she was going to the bathroom. She'll have to flush the toilet. I'm serious. She should. We strongly feel there should be no more talking. The time has come for action. Polly, don't look at our tapes. Go down there... Bye, Jeff. Bye. Ahh! [Cheering] I didn't go to the bathroom. Look, I'm sorry I've made a mess of things. It's just that... I don't know. I've never really been out with you before, and I just don't know what to say. I mean, if you want to talk about government or genetically produced fuel or something, that's fine. Or we don't have to talk at all. That's all. You can go if you want to.

You must have very strong feelings, Natalie. Your mother dead, your father so absent. What do you see here? There's this girl. And occasionally she does some modeling. She got a job posing next to a piano holding this doll baby. So she did it, got paid for it, and she went home. That's a very interesting story, Natalie. These are zinnias. Tell me about the zinnias. I can't tell you their color because it's black and white. Uh-huh. Uh, hurrying home, Natalie? Hmm? Isn't it true that the reason you are hurrying home is because of a certain young man named Jeffrey Moran? Actually, no, Dr. Rodney. I have a lot of homework to do. Your mother seemed very concerned, Jeff. Tell me about that picture. This boy did modeling. He had a job posing next to a piano holding a doll baby. Later he got a check in the mail. That's a very interesting story, Jeff. Who told you to say that? Did Natalie Becker tell you to say that? Doesn't, in fact, Natalie Becker tell you a lot of things to say, how to act, how to talk? Isn't that why you're here? Because not your parents, but Natalie Becker has decided to take over your life? [Bell rings] Look, I have a test. Oh, I'm very pleased you're so concerned with your schoolwork. I want you to study hard for that test. Promise me. There's one more thing... Why did the boy model get a check in the mail and the girl model got paid right there and then? I could really do it. I'll say I was sleeping at Natalie's, take the bus to the airport, and fly to New York. After the game, Zoo takes me to his hotel. Everybody knows Zoo. "Mr. Knudsen, I'll make sure you and your delicious wife aren't disturbed." Lisa, are we going out Saturday? I got concert tickets. Yeah, I can fit you in, I guess. Ha! Okay. See you, Jeff. He didn't hear you. Bye, Lisa. What's wrong with him? He's having a rough time at home, I guess. I thought he lived with Natalie Becker. She's letting him stay there. My parents are leaving this weekend. They're visiting my sister at the state pen. I mean, penn state. He can't drive. Come here, you. Mmm... I have to go before he wrecks my... Mmm... Car. ♪ Hmm mm mm ♪ [Telephone rings] ♪ Hmm mm ♪ Hello? Hello? Aunt Gail? This is strange. I thought I called home. It's Natalie. Natalie, I thought it was a boy. I'm confused.

I didn't know you had Government then. I always see you coming from Gym. You're so sweet. Why didn't you ever say hello? What are you doing tonight? Ahh... You sure kiss nice for someone with as little experience as you have. You know, almost everybody kisses. It's weird. All over the world, people kiss... The Saudis kiss... The Monogolians kiss... And the French kiss. Definitely, the French kiss. Hi, honey! I'm home! Oops! Boy, today has really been a bust. I mean crummy. Uh, I better get going. Don't leave on my account. I just live here.

Hmm, I-I don't really know what to say. I got a letter from your dad. He wants to be a filmmaker or a musician. Maybe I'll write him. He's staying with friends in California. He doesn't have an address. Why did he write? Oh, he wanted me to wire him something. I really wish that you'd come home, Jeffie. I really do. Natalie's dad won't let you live there forever. Then where will you be? All you ever think about is yourself. Ever since I met Gerry, if I didn't pay attention to you constantly, you would sulk or wouldn't eat or... Excuse me for wanting to spend time with you! How insulting of me! God! [Thunder] [Thunder] Sit down. [Thunder] Come here. No. Why not? I'm uncomfortable... Being up here. I can't help it.

I'm going to kill her. We have absolutely nothing in common. Nothing. But when I get to New York, Zoo will show me everything. Oh, Zoo! I knew you'd remember me. [Computer voice] "Dear Polly, thanks for your letter. It's always nice to hear from my fans. Love from Zoo." Well, bye. Ahem! [Knock on door] Polly? Hello! Ah! Oh! Guess what? I made it. I'm going to meet the President. It's the best thing that's ever happened. They said my essay's the best they've seen from a sophomore. We'll stay at this Phoenix Park Hotel. They even give us spending money. Stop. Want to see a little play I just made up? Once there was a girl named Petunia who had a friend named Nathan. I'm supposed to be Nathan? Nathan is a very experienced boy... He's gone all the way. And Petunia is less experienced. She's been to second base, maybe third... once... But she's really hot to trot. Tragedy strikes. Nathan doesn't like virgins. Polly, I like you. Thus... Petunia decides... She'll just teach herself. Did something happen between you and Zoo? Polly. Plenty of guys like you. I think it's just that you decide to get yourself all involved with some impossibility like Zoo Knudsen. Would you leave Zoo out of this? There's nothing the matter between me and Zoo! Everything's fine! What is it, then? What did I do? Nothing! You didn't do anything wrong. You've got your perfect little career and your perfect little boyfriend. How does it feel to break up a happy couple? How will your constituents feel about that? I didn't break up Casey and Lisa. That's not what the school thinks. Who? You tell me one person. See? Zoo gave me this. He sent you that? Polly, that's really gross! If you think he likes you, you're kidding yourself. I picked it out! It's my taste, and if that's what you think, then you can just get out! I mean it, get out! Miss Do-Not-Litter-The-Sidewalk! Miss Do-Not-Pollute-The-Air! Little Miss Pure, but I know you're not. You think you're so hot just because you slept with James Casey III! If you think he's your boyfriend, just think again, sweetheart. I did not sleep with Casey! I didn't. Get out of here, you swine! Hi. Jeff? It's me... pol. I'm glad you answered. Hang up, mother. Thank you. So, where's your roommate? They did? They left you all alone? Aw... Well, how about a little company? Okay. Great. I'll see you in five. Bye. Zoo will love that I'm so experienced. [Music playing] You were delirious two days and two nights... Jeff? Do you like me? Well, maybe that's why I'm so hungry... Me? Like you? Naw, not really. Mother... Have you ever wanted to kiss me? Thanks for sewing the shirt, but I can't find my pants. Get back in bed. That's the only thing that's kept me there this long... Polly... I think... I think you're really pretty. I'm not. Yeah. You are to me. ...that you might say something that would let us help you, like notifying your wife or anything. What did I say? If you had a wife. What did I say? You talked of Margo. She pulled out a red dress. What else? You mentioned someone named... Ha ha ha! If you have one, we could notify her. No wife. Ha ha ha! Polly? I have something... From my brother's wallet. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. You know, Zoo has a belt like that. I thought he got it at Morgan's, but he said a friend from Fayette made it for him. Jeff? [Zips pants] [Bell rings] All right, line up. Come on, watch it, now. Will I have time to ask the President questions? I don't see why not. What will you ask? It's about the equal rights amendment. I thought you would say that. You might get one of his back-ups. The President does pretend to be busy. Pretend? Does your father know yet? I told him last night. Hey, Jeff! Shhh! Isn't that Casey with Lisa? Let's go back in as fast as possible. Keep these two lines separate. I want to see... Hey, wait up! What's wrong? I saw you and Lisa during the fire drill. So? I'm here with you. I mean, I was waiting for you. Look, Lisa's Lisa, and you're you. What's that supposed to mean? That my relationship with you is totally different from my relationship with her. Do you sleep with her? I never tried to hide anything. I told you I'm not a monogamous type guy. Come on, Natalie, I really like you. I know that you see a lot of girls, but you weren't seeing her once we first started. Yes, I was. The whole time?

You, too. Listen up, gang. I've got disappointing news. The President has been called away. However, the President is extremely interested in our future leaders and has requested the Vice President lunch with you in his place. Not at the Vice President's place, but in his stead. Let's move into the next room for dessert. No, thank you. I read the Presidents had a free hand with it. Of course, there have been extensive renovations. There was a fire... Would you like to meet the Vice President? I'd love to. They've done a magnificent job in restoring this beautiful old building. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Uh, Mr. Vice President? I'd like you to meet Natalie Becker from... Ohio. Mm-hmm. Wonderful state. One of your senators is here today. Henry! Yes, yes, I remember, uh, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati. I've just been talking with one of your constituents. Senator Peterson, Natalie Becker. Hello, Natalie. I know of you, Senator. I wrote you a letter about the allocation of funds for Route 202 after you campaigned for improved mass transit. I'll leave this matter with you, Henry. If I hadn't voted for that bill, we would have converted state lands for freeways. Isn't it your job to get bills formulated without those kind of riders attached? Heh heh heh! It seems that you and I are coming to loggerheads. Loggerheads? What the hell kind of word is loggerheads? Perhaps you'd like to visit my offices. My research staff just collated a study on cloud seeding. I'm not sure about our schedule. Mr. Williams? Is there time to visit the Senator's offices? Not unless you skip sightseeing. Sightseeing? Yes. Oh, Mr. Williams, take her sightseeing later this afternoon if you think it's that important. If you'd like me to. Thank you very much. This one you owe me, Williams. [Knock on door] Just a sec! Okay! Bye, mom. Honey, I'll be back la... [Bat hits ball] Zoo, I'm here! Strrrrike! Hey, beer! Can I have a hot dog? Batting in the clean-up position, playing third base, number 39, Zoo Knudsen. Hey, Zoo! Zoo! Hi! All right, Zoo, go get 'em! Do it, Zoo! Yay! Waa-hooo! Wooo! I don't think Senator Peterson likes me. His staff did this research project recommending cloud seeding, so I asked him about the cloud seeding in Iowa. Didn't their farmland get flooded? Don't worry about it. The guy's a yo-yo. You should see this place in the springtime. The magnolias... The cherry blossoms. I'm a real romantic. Should I clerk with the Supreme Court when I get out, or practice public interest law for a few years? If you want to be President, you'll have to learn to make deals. The problem with making deals is that you won't be you, and you're what's so special. I won't lose that. How do you know? I have a little voice inside. It's me, Zoo! Zoo! Zoo! Zoo! Zoo! Zoo! Zoo, it's me. It's Polly! Zoo... Come on, come on! Let me go! Get off of me! Zoo! Put me down! Zoo! They're yelling for your blood, buddy. Tell them to let me back! Zoo! Tell them to let me back!

He says he has Polly's purse. What's Polly's purse doing in New York? That's what I don't understand. She's seeing Jeff today. What's Natalie's number? [Ring] Hello. Jeff, Stu Franklin. Oh, Stu. It's Bob Becker. Hi. Do you know where Polly is? Natalie's in Washington, so I don't know. I just got in. Put Jeff on the phone, then. Who? Jeff Moran. Jeff Moran? Hey, Polly. It's me, Jeff. Remember? Hey, Polly. How's it going? Yeah. Hey, just thought I'd pop over unannounced. Is Polly home? Come on in, Jeff. Polly's purse in New York? She was in love with this baseball player who played for New York. I'm going to call the stadium. No, I'm calling the police. No, we'll have the police call the stadium. How does she know Zoo Newton? Knudsen. You're putting your girdle on? We're not going dancing. I don't want to look like an animal. You got a boyfriend back home? Yeah. Well, no. Not anymore. Mm-mm. Would you like to come to my place tonight? I don't think so. Let's go see the Washington Monument. Oh, that's great. I love the Washington monument. This is it. You'll sleep here. I'll drive you to the airport in the morning. [Whistles] The bathroom's through there. You have parents? Mm-hmm. Don't you think you should let them know where you are? Not particularly. Not particularly? Won't they be worried? Probably. So, Bill... What's it like... An orgasm? You're too much, you know that? With a girl, I mean. Is it different, you know, from when you do it to yourself? Look. There's a bed, bathroom, water, bread, and I'll make you an egg tomorrow, but leave it at that, okay? But what's it like when you're with someone else? Okay. If I tell you, will you call your parents? Okay. What's the number? Tell me first. Okay. Here it is. Exquisite relief from torture. Torture? Thank god she's safe. Zoo Knudsen? Big time. Call off the police. I'm going to kill that girl. Torture? Why torture? Well... because it's real torture not to have the orgasm. So why torture yourself? Why not just have it? Because it feels so good to almost have it. Better than to have it? In a way, yeah. Really? In a way, no. Well, would you show me? Oh, cut it out, Polly. I was 15 in this picture. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to have an orgasm with? No, right? You all go for that stuff. You want some jazz, looks, fame, age. You know, there was this guy at school, shot his mother. Every girl in 11th grade was after that guy. There's a face only a mother could love. Other people could love your face. I don't want them to love my face. I want them to love me. I could. I could love you. Do you want me to? Oh. Look what I've got here. Chicken. Bill? Would you give me a kiss good night, anyway? Please? Good night. Thank you for a wonderful evening. Ahh. Mmm. Who are you? Jeffrey Moran, a friend of Natalie's. She's been helping me in my time of need. Those are my pajamas. I want to make a clean breast of things. Your daughter's really... Not that much. I'm just saying I live here. You do? Temporarily, of course. It's my 21st birthday, I'm at this party in New York. Who should I see but Bill the photographer. Instead of teasing me about that scene at the stadium, he says I'm beautiful. Polly! Nat! What are you doing here? You won't believe what happened. I went to New York. I didn't see Zoo, but I stayed with the nicest guy. Do your parents know? He's a photographer. You stayed at his house? Well, yes. Ooh. But he made me sleep on the couch and call my parents. Did you meet the President? No. How about the First Lady? The Vice President? You look so pretty. Really? Yes. I met the Vice President and Senator Peterson and this aide who was a nice guy, sort of. He showed me around. I learned more from him than from the big-name people. This guy I met was a nobody, too, but... I just remembered something. I'm mad at you. But let me show you this one picture. Oh, I'm off Zoo. It was fun, but I'm not into that anymore. Bill doesn't seem like my type, but I haven't had so much fun with a guy since I hung around with Jeff. Jeff, huh? Hi, mom. [Doorbell rings] She's here. Hello. Come in. I've been trying to reach you. I tried to reach you back. I'm always home. Nevertheless, I tried to reach you. I'm home all the time. You have to come. Why don't you just leave me alone? Jeffie, I'm your mother. You abandoned me for your husband. You little brat, I did not abandon you. You left, and don't forget that! You were so busy playing house, you didn't realize you were hurting people. I'm sorry. Listen, mother, Natalie likes me. She likes having me around. In fact, who invited you here? Excuse me for wanting to be with you! What's going on here? Don't yell at her. I made her do it. No, you didn't. What were you thinking? You can't live with a man. We didn't do anything. I was not living with a man. Where are your things? In the piano bench. Where are his things? Natalie. In the piano bench. Hee hee hee! You're disappointed in me, aren't you? I'm especially disappointed you didn't tell me. What are you doing? Why don't you stay home? Is that everything? I'll live in California with my father. They already have a man working this territory. You could look for a new job. Natalie, I can't. I'm finally making decent money. California, huh? Yep. He always told me I could come live with him. Jeff, he doesn't have a home. He doesn't have a job. He hasn't spoken to you since when? All that man knows how to do is play. What's wrong with playing? You used to carry me around on your back like a pony. Honey, it was you that got tired of that, not me. It was you that realized friends were more fun than your mother. I grew up. I know, and I'm glad. How did I let you down? You married Gerry. Aw, Jeff. Gerry's a good man. Why can't you give him one chance? I don't want to give him a chance! He's not my father. He's the only one you'll ever have. Come here. Honey, I'm sorry. ♪ Dear you ♪ ♪ Love, me ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪ Stop. No. You have to make up. I'm so embarrassed. He hates me.
