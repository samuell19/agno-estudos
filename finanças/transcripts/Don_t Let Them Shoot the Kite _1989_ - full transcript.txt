DON'T LET THEM SHOOT THE KITE Ingredients have arrived for "asure". Hi! Hi! Hi... She's Turkish. Really? The tourist gave me raisins! Give me some. Why isn't it flying, Inci? It will, someday. Where we met, there were no flowers, no trees reaching up to the clouds. Even the pretzel vendor couldn't be heard. Only some birds were seen on the yard. If only his name Baris (Peace) had embraced the world he would not have been raised in such a place. But his mother didn't know the meaning of Baris, nor did his father who named him after a pop star. Those who knew why they were here, and those who didn't, all loved him. Baris loved them also. But he had a favorite he loved passionately. Our story was a love story. He taught me to fly to the green fields, on bird wings. Dream and reality were one in his childish expression, and the world's ugliness would fade away in our sky. I learned to fly an imaginary kite through him. Where is Inci? In the ward upstairs. Inci! Don't step on the floor! Keep that bastard silent. Shut-up! I have a terrible headache, I'll break your bones. Inci is not here. She just went downstairs. I said, don't step there. - Girls... - What is it, Baris? Come in. Where is Inci? In there, she's busy. I said she's busy. Tell me. Come quick, Inci. There is something outside. I'm busy, dear. Maybe later... But it's a bird, it looks like a bird. It has a huge tail. What is it? I don't know, he looks alarmed. It's gone. Where was it? Right there. What did it look like? It had a long tail. Something like that? Yes. It's not a bird. It's a kite. Is it a kind of bird? No. Look, it hasn't even got wings. How can it fly, then? It's the wind and the children. See, you hold the string and run. Then you let the string go and the kite flies up into the sky. You mean, like the birds? Exactly. - Let's try then. - OK. We can't make it fly here. This yard is too small. Then we'll make a small kite. One needs a large field to fly kites. What does a large field look like, Inci? We've seen pictures in the books, remember? There were also children playing? That's right. There you can fly a kite. When shall we fly one? Whenever we get out of here. Will you take me? Sure, I will. Promise? Promise. Are you getting a long nose, Inci? There was a carpenter who carved toys of wood. Would he carve one for me? It's a fairy tale. So he could make it in the fairy tale. Maybe he would! Anyway, one day he made a beautiful wooden puppet. What is a puppet, Inci? A kind of toy. It can't move by itself. When his master moves his fingers like this, it can move and dance. What was his name? Pinocchio. Why not Baris? Just Pinocchio. One day he did things he shouldn't have. His master noticed this. But Pinocchio denied. His nose started to grow. He lied so many times that in the end he had a long nose. But my nose won't grow long. Why? Don't you ever lie? Yes. So? My nose isn't wood. You said you would take me with you, remember? I could hide in the suitcase and no one would see. Then I'd scare you. I'd hide once more. Even you couldn't find me. We had planned to fly a kite, remember? You had promised. Why did you lie to me? Now, you've got a long nose, haven't you? Just like Pinocchio. Gulfidan Yetis. Male visitor. Take your stuff. Good news. Your grandchildren are here. Let me hold them Mama. No, it's forbidden. Please, open the slot. I miss the little one so much. I want to hold her. New orders. We can't open it. Why are the grandchildren crying? They want to come in, I suppose. Why? There are no pretzel vendors here. They must have missed her. Why doesn't my father ever come, Inci? He might be busy. He's always busy. He was here recently. When the slots were still open remember, your mother handed you to him? He took you out and bought pretzels. You even saved one for me. Will he come again? Of course, he will. When? I don't know. But we'll ask the birds. Would they know? Sure they would. - Birds... - Birds! - How is Baris' father? - How is Baris' father? Look, the little one is Baris and the other one is his father. Baris' father! Baris' father, why don't you come here? Come here! Why did you throw that stone? They're gone. They're not coming. But if you throw stones at them they will never come again. Do you think they are angry? You better call them. The small one may bring you good news one day. Birds... Birds... Don't ask for the Moon. Hello, hello. - Welcome. - Thank you. Where are Nuran and Gulçin? Nuran has a headache. And Gulçin is writing a letter. As usual. I'll get the tea. Wait, I'll do it. Poor thing she hasn't seen her children once. Extrañamente extraña. She'll have to stay long, she probably killed the man. She doesn't talk about it, why do you? Nobody talks straight. Am I the judge? The new comer says she was slandered. Maybe she's innocent. No one would slander her. What is slander? You shut up. Why is she here? She poured hot water over her neighbour's head. She says she fell into the boiling water by accident. Why is her family here? They were all brought here after their fight. Come here. Selma, Hacer, you too. We'll have a tea party for the grandchildren. Why did your grandchildren cry? They wanted to come in. Probably missed me too much. Why didn't they come? Mama didn't let them. Is she your mama, the one with the keys? Why do you call her mama? She's our superior. But your hair is grey. Stop cross-examining, you little scoundrel. Do mothers lock up their children? That bastard of mine? He didn't show up again. I bet he's found a whore. Don't blame him! I'm here because of him. Now he is enjoying himself. Don't accuse him wrongly. He's a real bastard. He tried to live with another woman. But was afraid I'd reveal he was a drug dealer. Why did you take the blame, then? Baris wouldn't have to grow up in prison. The man should stay outside, he has to take care of us. But he doesn't even come. Mind your own business. I know my man. He must be in trouble. - Birds. - Yes, birds. Team leader... Team leader... Gülçin! This is for me. Gulfidan! Gülçin. Gülçin again. She has three now. Sultan Sahin! Nurhan! Ayse. She's green with envy. She's just like my horrible mother-in-law. For Gulçin again. Ayten. You are lucky. It's probably from Yusuf. Her husband claims she was in Yusuf's bed. You weren't faced with a "second wife". Why didn't the birds bring any letters today? I don't know. Maybe they are offended. Is your fiancée offended, too? Maybe. Why doesn't he come to visit you? Because he is also in the cage. Why did they put him in the cage? He asked too many questions. I'm moody todoy. No more questions, okay? Come on, let's ask the birds. Maybe they have news of your father. I don't want to talk with them now. Let's have a look at the picture books. Shall we? Let's go. The Union leader stated time is pressing and that they will consider other ways. Regarding the amnesty politicians seem optimistic. The head of the opposition party said an amnesty law is being prepared but it will exclude political crimes. Amnesty, amnesty! Amnesty, amnesty! Amnesty, amnesty! Don't be sad. I hope it will include you too. We'll be happy for you anyway. They haven't announced it yet. They said, "they will consider". Besides it's the opposition party. I heard it. Do you mean, I'm lying? Of course not! The radio is. The state radio never lies. You're jealous, that's all. Tell me. Will there be an amnesty? There will. You cute little kid. Amnesty, amnesty! Are we going home? Go away! I'll send you home. Then your father will have to put up with you. The amnesty will be announced! Let them be jealous. No amnesty! DELETED SCENE OLD WOMAN: Fuck you son of a bitch! BARIS: Fuck you. INCI: No bad words, Baris, remember? Yes, Baris? I want to see the picture books. Baris is punished today, Sevim. Why? What did he do? He swore. So you see, Baris. You are not allowed in today. I won't swear again. Then you won't be punished. But today you are. Please sit down. Could you write an answer for me, dear? Sure. But she started first. Pick up the wood! Why do I always do the hard work... in here and out of these walls. I wish death would free me. I should have shot him right between the eyes. That would have made me happy. Stop. You sound like you don't love anybody. No, I don't. What about your first love? May the devil take him, too! He didn't even succeed in running away with me. You never loved again? Watch out, Baris! Real love happens only once. Todoy love is like plastic, it's artificial. What is plugstick? It's not plugstick, it's plastic. Like... buckets. Even people. Just look behind you! She always complains! - Why do they keep her here? - I don't know. Let's ask Selma to write a petition to free her. Ayse, come here! Serve the tea. Nice place. Doesn't look like a prison cell. Before it was awful. We tried to decorote. It looked miserable. Inci remembers what it was before. It was a dark dirty place. We used to live here. The walls were wet all over. It was really depressing. Here is the bread! Our bread is ready. Come on, Ayse. Did they release your husband? No, not yet. So the family is here. Why? It seems your mother-in-law made a mess. She started the fight and the others followed. She says it's slander. And that every one is lying. No, not at all! She poured boiling water over her neighbour's head. What is slander? To blame somebody without evidence. Damn! You should be ashamed of yourself! You wet your bed at your age! I didn't do it. Who did it, then? Mickey Mouse did. So it's Mickey! Get down, I'll change the sheets. What happened? My mother slandered. It was Mickey who peed. I'll do it. You know the new one? No. But the poor thing doesn't have anything. So I made her some tea. What's her story? She lived with a married man. And his wife reported them. A "second wife"? Hey, what are you doing? You're nuts? Don't ever sit on my bed again! Stop this habit of yours. Don't say that, she's an orphan. She'll sleep with me. They screw around and then come here. They disgrace our ward. Come on... Shut up! - You shut up! - They have no respect for the old. - What's the matter? - She hit her. - The warden? - No, Fatma did. Why did you? I do what I want. You better mind your own business. Baris, come here! We are walking. Go inside. I want to walk. I know what it's like to be an orphan. It's fate. She shouldn't have hit her. He was a deserter. I didn't know. I was preparing some soup, but they arrested me, too. It was fated thus. Just bad luck. It's fate. Who is fate? He is the one who locked us up. Mama with the bunch of keys? The kite has disappeared, Inci. It won't. But what, if it does? We'll draw a new one. Will we? Sure. Baris! Baris, come here! Quickly! Fire, in the mens' wards! My God! We'll burn to ashes. Help, amnesty, help! - Yusuf, my Yusuf! - He will be roasted. They'll let us all go. I have no place to go. Don't be alarmed. It's just a little spark. They'll extinguish it soon. - My earrings! Who took them? - They're on your ears. My purse. I've lost my purse. Guard, soldier. How is Yusuf, is he alright? I want my purse back, or else... Listen, girls. Whoever took her purse put it under the stairs. Otherwise she'll pay for it, now, I'll have a look. Don't listen. Light a candle for our Saint. - Which one? - Under the stairs. He accepts every good man's wish. Let's go. The guard just said there is nothing to be afraid of. One bed burned, but has been extinguished. They came from outside. Let me pay. You might need money here. We'll talk about it later. Please, Holy One, let them release me after the hearing tomorrow. Amen. You better light both. For you and for Ayse. We just prayed to the Saint. The Saint once took my mother's earrings and put them in aunt Sultan's pocket as a joke. Are you the only friend of the Saint? You question my virtue? Bitch! Is my purse in your pocket? Bullshit! You don't deserve any help. You whore, go to hell! - Save some for Ayten. - OK. Selma will join us, too. - Will you have some soup? - Yes, Selma will add spice to it. Ladle head, ladle head! I'm going to tickle you. I'm starving! It's late! Stop playing. I'm going to catch you. Nothing is left! The food is terrible. I'll complain. That's not true. You ate all the meat. I gave the meat to Baris. What about us? We're hungry! He's a child. Why did you hit her? She's right. Baris needs meat. Let him have shit! Did his mother ask me before she fucked? Don't curse. Whose book? It's mine, but... Shut up! Tear it! Get an envelope! I want to explain. Shut up! Turn around! All of you! Face the wall! There is nothing behind us. Can't we sit? My gold bracelet is inside. Please don't let me lose it. Everybody turn around! Turn! Face the wall! You too. Turn around! You too. Tear up this piece! Put them in here! Go, throw it into the stove! Go and check if he throws it into the stove. Go and check that he checks properly. What's this? What's this on the ground? It's a kite. Who is this little bastard? My son. Who put this nonsense into his head? I didn't, I swear. If this child speaks again you'll be transfered, he'll be sent to reformatory! I checked that it was checked. I checked that the envelope was thrown. The envelope is in the stove. So you won't stay still. Courtyard forbidden two days! - Yes sir. - Everybody in. Go on inside! Quickly! Erase it! What are they erasing? The kite. Why, was he scared of the kite? Anymore questions and I'll show you. You spoil him too much. You'll never go there again! Welcome. - Is Arzu around? - Arzu? There is no Arzu here. A young, pretty blond girl with long hair? Welcome. I was looking for you. Here I use my real name. You have other names? Who is this smart allic? He's Fatma's son. Arrange a bed for me. They'll send mine tomorrow. No problem. Are you hungry? No, I had a snack at the police station. Maybe tonight. Do you get meat? Yes, but it's expensive. Send for soap and toothpaste. Find someone to write a petition. I can pay for it. The girls will write but they don't accept money. Everybody out! Move it! Come on! Who's the leader? I am. What's your name? Zeynep Kaya. Your crime? Thoughts. Don't be smart. You lost a book! I didn't. While you... Enough! Besides, you beat people here. - I never have. - Sultan Sahin told me. Sure, she slapped me. I'm not lying. Your new leader will be Mrs. Sumbul. I was chosen by the whole ward. I won't leave, unless they say so. We don't want another leader. She's our leader. You don't appreciate our kindness. From now on Sumbul is your leader. Understand?! This is not a hotel, we give you everything. But you lose books, you beat your friends in the ward. A leader must be capable of order. From now on Sumbul is your leader, understand? - Is that clear? - Yes. It's clear. God bless you. Move! What are you doing? Go inside - come on. They seemed to like me. But nobody reacted. It's useless whatever you do. You shouldn't have hit Sultan. It wouldn't have mattered either way. I'm glad you did it. Sumbul would deserve it - That's too harsh. - Why? She deserves it! Does upstairs agree? We don't need their support. Girls... Come in, Baris. Why did you lose the book? There is going to be a trial, Baris. Public prosecutor, read the indictment. How did you choose that library book? "Tactics For Anti-Communist Struggle" What does "Coyyunist" mean? Ladle head. Ladle head. Shut up! Don't make fun of me! One for the kid, please. Send the bastard out. He's bothering us. Move. Get up, you creatures. Wake up, you lazy bitches... do you hear me?! Get up, don't you hear me? I can't wait the whole day. Hurry up! Quick now you need to be counted. Stop that chatter. Cut that babbeling. That's enough. Shut up. We've had enough of you. So you're protesting. You'll pay for this. Don't threaten us. Come, there's a fight upstairs. Nuren is asleep. Let's get her or she'll continue being mean. We've waited enough. Let's see what's going on. Beat her now. We didn't decide yet. Come on. Come down if you dare. You lousy old bitch! Enough! Move! - Where's Filiz? - Don't know. I'm going to sleep. What happened? They're sending me somewhere else. Will Fatma go, too? No. She said that Filiz forced me to beat Sumbul. My mother has slandered, hasn't she? How do you know what slander is? She did the same thing to me. I'll really miss you. Will you be alone, there? There'll be some other girls. Will there be a kite, too? Will anyone be released after today's hearings? Who was called? Ayse and Sumbul. Maybe free for New Year. Yes, someone is leaving. I wish it were Sumbul. Ayse! Thank you. The judge accepted the petition you wrote. I'm glad to hear that. So Miss Lawyer. Another success. She didn't succeed with her case. It's hard to accuse your boss. You couldn't prove it, now you're here. His revenge. You slandered? That's right. In truth, it was Mickey who peed. Sumbul is coming to say goodbye. Who is it? Girls! We're reading. But it's very important. Girls, Baris has great news. What? Come on. Sumbul is leaving. Help me make the cake. Just a minute. We're busy. This is to celebrate Sumbul's departure. Filiz Ozturk! Filiz Ozturk. Get ready to leave! You stay with the kid. I'll be back. Be a good boy. She's going to the doctor. - Is this the outside? - Yes. Is my father here somewhere? Come on, let's sit over there. What's that gun for? To shoot runaways. But my mother wouldn't run away. - Inci! - Baris! Is this for me? Come! What is it? Another kite? Bird... It's a little bird. My bird. Your bird. You are Baris' little bird. How will we manage to feed it? - No idea. - What will we do? We need milk. Why don't you pet it? It's yours. - Does it bite? - No, if you love it. We must find milk and a dropper. Now you will take care of it. But what if it flies away? It won't. If his father comes? I wouldn't know. Will he fly? Not yet. When? When he learns to fly. When will he learn? We'd better put him back, and let him sleep. Okay? Look, it's "Little Baris'" mother. No, it's his father. Okay, his father. He wants to see "Little Baris". Shall we let him? But he won't go out. We'll let him go through here. But if he flies away? Never mind. Maybe he misses his father. Maybe. Okay? Nothing. He must have grown up. Maybe a cat ate him. We'd see the feathers. Won't he be hungry? His father will feed him. Here. Water this everyday. Look at the airplane, catching the sunset for us. What is a sunset, Inci? Look at the bird's wings. The sun is waving at you. The sun goes to sleep with the birds, and waves with the birds, to those who can't watch the sunset. Let's wave to them. You know Safinaz, I miss the stars so much. You should see them above the fields. Shall I see them again? Why wouldn't you? Maybe at the age of Mother Gulsum. Won't they let us out summer nights? No. I haven't seen the stars in five years. You'll be able to see them soon. That's true. Your time is almost done. How many days left till your release? Too many. Are you leaving? If I do, a little bird will bring you my love. Maybe she'll come back as a kite. A kite? But I'm going with you anyway. Look Baris, another plane. It's a cloud plane. Can you see the stars now, Inci? We only have day skies. Does your sky have a night time? You said you'd never be back. I had no choice. Pregnant? So quickly? Nine months already. Why back? I knocked. No answer. I thought no one was home. I was caught. And charged? He didn't even care that I was pregnant. It's time. She's in labor. Wake up! The baby! I'll get the guard. She must go to the infirmary. Maybe to the hospital. She says she's ashamed. She won't go. Couldn't you wait till tomorrow morning? Birth won't wait. I'll call the warden. It always happens during my shift. ¡Dios! Hold on. Can't take her anywhere. No doctor in the infirmary. Permission for the hospital is not available now. You must be strong. It's not a toothache! You're in jail. You can't expect a doctor. Dios mío. I'll wake Gulsum. Get some hot water and clean sheets. Gulsum Ana! What is it? Come. Dona is in pain. Have you got a blade? The boy is your ticket out. May God give him strength. Hope he grows up a free man. His cord was cut by a blade. The bastard will travel. Call him Ozgur (Free)? No, no I want Ahmet. Baris will no longer be the favorite. How cute... Stop pulling my skirt. Dona is feeding, now. Give her extra food You should be ashamed? You're too old now. You're a big brother. Ahmet is the baby now. You're a man now. He hasn't even been circumcised, yet. What's circumcised? Your penis will be cut. Don't cut my penis. You won't be a man. It's not bad, Baris. It doesn't even hurt. Are you circumcised? Girls aren't. He'll have a beard by the time his mother is released. I'll write a petition. They'll let him be circumcised here. Why don't we have him cut before you leave? I'll cook a "asure" cake. Will there be raisins in it? Of course. You saw him circumcised before leaving.. You are not going, are you? What shall I bring you if I go? A man's sweater. It's a raisin, isn't it Inci? Yes, it is. Don't forget us. Try to write. Of course. Don't work too hard. Safinaz, if I can find your children, I'll let you know. God bless you. Good bye. What will I do with him now? He'll tear the place down! Let him. It will be better for all. God bless you. Give the baby a kiss. Get married, have children, don't come back. Maybe I'll come back if I miss you too much. Don't say that. Your laughter will stay with us. Keep smiling forever. Hurry up or I'll say she changed her mind. Baris would be happy. Where is he? He's sleeping. I didn't dare wake him up. I want you to write me, mostly about Baris. Be at the fortress tomorrow, Baris and I will wave. Bueno. Don't force her on her first day. You should have a real cup of tea instead. Take care of him. If our letters are stopped, the birds will bring news. Try to visit. If you can't, we'll wave to the fortress on visiting days. Maybe you'll come back as a kite. If you don't let her go, I won't give you your letters. Are you really leaving? Inci, don't forget to send letters. May God protect you. So long. Don't forget us. Let's give her a big hand. Don't forget to write. Try to visit. Inci... Baris. Baris. Come... Come... Come... Come... Come... Come, come... Inci, please don't go. Look, Inci left her pillow for you. What's wrong? Has she forgotten me? No. Why? Inci didn't come, nor the bird. Remember, she might come back as a kite. Inci! What's going on? It's a kite! Didn't I tell you? Where did this come from? Come here. What this means? Find out who's flying the kite. Come here, Koth. What a mess! Find out who's flying the kite! Hurry up! We can't find who's flyingthe kite. Go away, damn it! Shoot! Shoot that kite! They couldn't shoot the kite. Baris, the kite has escaped. Why doesn't it fly, Inci? It will, one day.
