Hungarian National Film Archives Objektív Stúdió presents CIRCUS MAXIMUS BUDAPEST-Eastern railway station - No! - Come on! - No! - Calm down! No! No! Aah! No! It's an air raid! Go to the basement! Attention! This is an air raid warning. To all defence districts: attention! Bácska, Baja, Veszprém! Attention! To all defence districts in Budapest. Your papers! Resident's certificate. Were you waiting for us? Are you all Jews? Have you checked them all? They're all in order. Except these gentlemen. And the kid? A little extra, captain. François Desfontaines. Dr. Griefahn. You'll come with us. How did you get here? You? Eat. That's all we need... - That... as you say. - What are we going to do now? We? Nothing. He is my son. Old Joe could hide him until we come back. He's coming with me. You're as mad as your son. So what? If you're afraid of us, stay here. God damn this bloody raid, they should be here by now. Tell the others to get ready. What do you want? I want to help. Please go. Your husband? I told you to leave. All right, folks. It's time to get moving. One thing's for sure: they won't get bored. Do you really believe that we are leaving? Yes, I do, young man. I do. Our manageress can count. I figured it out. 800 per person. There's the three of us, and the others are coming soon. That makes seven. Let me count. Let me see. One, two, three, four, five. 5,600 all in all. She won't let this much slip out of her hands. There won't be any for the next season. There's still some left in the backyard. Someone has to scratch it up. Bobó! The other bear died. You're going to sleep in here. The police. Do you understand this? You didn't mention the child. - Now I do. - How much? - The same. - Here you are. - That's only 5. I need 3 more. - You'll get it. - What about the papers? - Come. Get on the second wagon. Boris! Show them their place. This one's for the Frenchman, this one for the Austrian doctor and his daughter. I need one more. For my son. - But your son is... - You're wrong. He's here. He's escaped. I'm not letting him back to the asylum. He's coming with me. You know that's impossible. You're son's mad. What you're asking of me isn't madness? You're forgetting that he's killed someone. It's not his fault. He is sick. I'll take care of him. I've learned my lesson. This isn't the first deal I've made with you. No papers... no trip. - Regards to the professor. - Let's hope I'll meet him. Bobó, mount up! Almásy's got caught. - I know. - His son, Gergely, too... What if they beat the names of the others out of them? Why didn't you go with them? Why didn't you? We're moving! Here. Have a cigar. - Here. - No smoking in the wagon. Oh, yes, of course. But I have something for you, little girl. An apple. Do you like apples? - What's your name, dear? - Ingrid. - That's a lovely name! - Say thank you to the gentleman. Now, go to bed. This will be your corner, okay? She would have more room with me. That's very kind of you, but I don't want to bother anyone. Don't be so polite, we have a long way to go, and she must get some sleep. This is your place, and this is mine. All right? Come up here. This is London. You are listening to the English radio. The latest news from the Western front was released 11 o'clock today by the Allied Forces headquarters. The report says: "Our air force has brought tremendous support to the infantry units on all sections of the front. Attacks were carried out above Northern France yesterday afternoon. Enemy railway centres, larger units, ammunition stores, airports and other targets were attacked. Heavy bombers, escorted by fighter planes, bombed airports and railway bridges northwest of Villeneuve and important military centres in the region between the bay of Biscay and the Seine. The bombers met no resistance." First I had to flee Vienna. In '38. We had a liaison office there. One Saturday the Führer marched in. One million people shouted "Sieg Heil"! The hotel doorman helped me. He took me to Prague in a hearse. And guess what? The Führer followed me! Great joke. And do you know the name of Czechoslovakia's president? Há-cha. It's a good one, right? I fled from there to our Budapest office. My brother left for Switzerland in time. And Hitler followed me to Budapest in March. I think he's out to get me. When did you come to Hungary? Not long ago. Are you Israelites? What is it with you? What's with the third degree? I have the right to know whom I'm traveling with. You should be glad you're sitting here. Whoa! Good evening. What a life! It was you the last time, right? No. 10 people, 6 horses, 3 wagons, one bear and the accessories. Destination? - Gendarmes. - You'll get used to them. They are waiting for us. No wonder, our show is first class. Have a good trip. - God bless you. - Giddy up! Let's go! Bless you! Giddy up! Bobó! What have you done? Bobó! Stop fooling around and come get washed immediately! Gregor, get him off that tree. A strange family. Yes. A bit strange. Why did you want to make me cry? I thought you were dead. How come you're alive? You're lucky. Really lucky! But how will you pay if you start losing? Do you have money? Don't you worry about me. I've a guardian angel. Do you think the lady would carry a deserter otherwise? And did you win all that money playing cards? You can't leave everything to chance. The authorities were getting too close. So I went to see a businessman just like you in his villa when he was not home. You're a burglar then? I wouldn't say that exactly. Should I have gone to the front and become a human cannonball? Do you draw one more? - What are you staring at? - You. Go dry yourself in the sun. Hurry up! What are you staring at? What are you waiting for? Get undressed! Whoa! Whoa, Jenő! Whoa, Sári! Whoa! You didn't tell me about these detours. - Who are we picking up? - It's none of my business. She paid for two. I don't know if the man is her husband or her lover. - A Pole. - And what's he doing here? Playing the hero, like you. Thank you. Thank you. Stop the wagon! - I'm getting off. - You're right. And where do you want to go? - I don't know. - You're staying here. You'll sleep with me until you decide what you want. If you want to die, too, you can change your mind. We've enough time before we reach the border. - What do you want? - To sleep. You've had more to drink than you can take. We'll see. Go to hell! - Good morning. - Good morning. You are...? I'm François Desfontaines. I am looking for professor Máthé. - What do you want? - I'd like to speak to him. I'm listening. Excuse me, but I really have to talk to him. Go ahead. You're wasting your time, professor. You should know that our information is quite correct in such delicate matters. I know that you were colleagues at a high school, and you stayed friends. I think it's quite natural that... considering your problematic ancestry, the professor gave you his papers. But I mustn't talk to his papers, but to himself. He is not home. I'll wait until he comes. It's okay, Béla. I don't want to waste your time. What can I do for you? Unfortunately, we don't know each other. You can't imagine how much I regret disturbing you - in your idyllic solitude. - You're not disturbing me. - Please, do sit down. - Thank you. Please, believe me, I'm not happy to do this. I've been given the task-- Of smuggling me to the United States through Yugoslavia and Sicily. In other words, of smuggling Rudolf Máthé, the old tramp, from Hungary. You are going to smuggle that other tramp out. They are after him, not me. If I'm correct... you've been informed about the plan of your escape. That's correct. And now you don't want to accept the invitation? Absolutely correct, sir. The fact that you've been sent here makes me think that you're not just anybody. You're a French officer, if I've been informed correctly. As such, you must have passed a test of honour. I am asking you to save my friend, whose life, as you heard, is in danger. They're expecting you. They have enough good mathematicians. Do you want them to come here begging? Please don't take me wrong. I don't object to the means of travel. I've always loved the circus, since I was a child. I object to the purpose of this journey. That's all. Oh, sorry, I am talking too much and I forgot to ask what I can get for you. Even unexpected visitors are welcome guests. Well, what would you like: plum, cherry or apricot? If I may chose: apricot. The police haven't seen this one. Home-made! I have grown quite fond of it since I have been in your hospitable country. I escaped a German POW camp a year and a half ago. I had a pleasant hiding place in a manor in Nógrád county. My hosts were excellent bridge players. - To your health, gentlemen! - To yours! Here you are. It was there that I got my orders to take professor Máthé to the other side. All very romantic. Do they teach you this in the army school? I've no idea. I'm an Indo-German linguist and I would rather sit in my library in Paris than here, in your house. I am no good at being a hero. I can relate to that. But, on the other hand, you'd expect me to help in nuclear research. Wonder weapons... What happens if a madman gets hold of these wonders one day? Exactly! The Germans are also testing heavy water in Hechingen. What happens if that madman gets hold of it first? Have you thought about that ? I've given up thinking. It's out of fashion. What for? You're refusing what I've asked without thinking about it. Rudi! Come to your senses! I have the right to be senile. Are you coming or not? Excuse me for disturbing you. You idiot! Yes... I am an idiot. What are you doing here? I'm going back to Budapest to my flat. Are you out of your mind? Daddy! Look here! - Bobó, put her down. - Come here. Get the horses, we are moving out! Hurry up, Bobó! Tell your daughter to leave my son alone, he's not a toy. They can play together, he's just a big child. Sometimes he's not a child. Then he doesn't know what he's doing. Bobó is a good kid. He likes to be loved. Just like all children. Like your daughter. She never talks about her mother, yet she always talks about her. That she is waiting for you in Lisbon. Where? She can't wait to meet her. No one is waiting for us. My wife is under house arrest in Wiener Neustadt. She sent a message in the last minute urging us to escape. What do they want from your wife and your daughter? An address that would help them. My address. Are you German? I'm an Austrian doctor in a German uniform. You know, people in Austria had plans in case Hitler's assassination had worked out. It was a matter of chance. Why are you telling me all this? Maybe because I want you to care for Ingrid. She is a smart kid. I don't know how long she's going to believe my lies. Are we going or not? Yes, we are. Professor, I'm happy you've changed your mind. Don't be so happy. My friend is coming with me. There's hardly any room left. You said one person. Is she going to pick up every tramp on the road? Why? Who do you think you are? Everything is only a matter of money, right, Carlotta? I'm covering our guest's expenses. You're not covering anything. I'm paying for my friend. It'll cost you extra. Aren't you ever ashamed of yourself? - Come on, Béla. - Never. Giddy up! Giddy up! Pull it! Go, damn you, pull it! Giddy up! Damn it! Don't spare him! Push it! Go to the other one. He doesn't want to cooperate with you. He only wants to see me arrive safely. Why don't you trust your friend? Because I'm afraid your plan won't work out. My task is to deliver him. - Whether he helps or not. - He won't help you. He doesn't believe in salvation by bombs. You see her every morning when she washes herself. Tell me... What's she like naked? What do you want from her? Nothing. She keeps wiggling her bottom at me. I'll kill you if you don't leave her alone. You, kill me? - Or my son. - That little idiot? He'll throw a knife in your back when you're not watching. You don't say! Yes. And he does what I tell him. Then tell him why. Because I'm sick of his old hag of a mother. I can't stand you. I feel like throwing up when I look at you. Don't you ever look in the mirror? I don't want you, do you hear? I don't want you! Stop! Stop it! No! Ah, no! I always told him it would kill him, his heart would stop one day. I begged him to stop last night, but he just drained the bottle. He didn't listen to me. Just like your father. He died of drinking. What should we do with the body? We can't just leave it here. Bury him. Bobó! Bobó! He didn't die of heart failure. He was killed. You were out there. You saw everything. Why do you keep quiet? What good is it if I speak? Will the doctor keep mum as well? He will. We repeat the report of the Hungarian News Agency. American warplanes entered Hungarian air space last night in several waves, and bombed Budapest. Fires broke out in several districts. The population has suffered heavy losses. You're in on this, aren't you? Are you mocking me professor or do you really think I'm an idiot? Of course not. You always know what you want. You've penetrated my house like a bomb. I've already begged your pardon. But you're still carrying me around with this pitiful circus to the biggest one, where lions eat not only Christians and Jews, but each other also. An Indo-German linguist... What a joke. Dog, come here! Have you managed to convince him? I like this man. He knows exactly what he doesn't want. What a sweet little piggy! Can I have it? - Where did you find it? - The poor thing got lost. Give me the knife, Boris. What are you doing with the pig? Not in front of the ladies, please! I beg your pardon. - You know how to cook? - Well, it depends. - Is this a Hungarian soup? - It's a wartime soup. But I'll make you some real pancakes. Okay? Can you make some? I love them! - Germans? - You're almost right. They're Americans. Stop laughing. What do you want with those guns? Are you afraid of us? What do you want, sir? What do you want? You can't take my coat, I have my briefcase and my family photos in it. We don't want to hurt anyone. Bobó! Bring here Gregor's clothes. Please, don't take it, my family photos are inside... There are enough clothes. For both of you. - Can we put our hands down? - All right. Are these your friends? - Among others. - Congratulations. Thank you. How did you get in such a tricky situation? Our navigator was out by a couple of miles. - Where were you heading to? - To the other side. - We, too. - Say... Would you take us along? They can't come with us. They would get us into trouble. I get to decide who is going to travel in my circus. - Any money? - Yes. That's not enough, boys. Rings, watches? Here you are. All right, you can come. Bury those guns somewhere. - Are they partisans? - Rather Croatian Fascists. They are worse than the Germans. You'll meet our friends when we reach the mountains. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Weren't you in Banja Luka last June? I don't know, possible. With another group. You had a midget then. Oh, yes. We had a midget then. There was no show. Next time, we will make the show. You're free to go. Thank you. She gives them at least a hundred for each of us. She's not even overpaid. Are we that cheap? Or are we not even worth that? Whoa! What do they want? Get the papers. I want to speak to the owner. That's me. What can I do for you? We've just been checked at the border. It doesn't matter. I came for you. The wounded in our hospital would like a little entertainment. They need a doctor, not a clown. People are waiting for us. So, they can wait. We want a performance in our hospital first. We can't stop in every stupid village. We've had better artists than you. I command you to perform. - Maybe next time. We have to go now. - Don't you understand? This is an order. She has finally understood. My men will escort you. Follow them. Giddy up! Move! Whoa! Get ready. The performance begins at 3. God damn them! What did that Croatian officer want? - Why were we brought here? - Stop asking stupid questions. What do you think they want from a circus? They want a circus! Or did you forget that you are members of a circus troupe? They want to see a show, their wounded are bored. A performance? Give them money. - As much as they want. - Put it away. There's no way out. We must put on a show. It is madness, and you know it. Yes, but it's an order. It's suicide. Do you have a solution? Go and introduce yourself as a French officer. Take the whole troupe with you. Don't forget to tell them they're all Jews, deserters and God knows what else. I don't feel like dying with my son for a Croatian commander. Let them have their circus if that's what they want. I've wiggled through half of Europe on the rope, the bear can still dance, and maybe you know something useful. Stop it. You can count on us. Have you got a clown's outfit? There's something for everyone. Pull up here with that green wagon. Bobó, pull over and get the costume boxes. Follow me, everyone. Le there be a circus, then. Whoa! Good girl! We could've reached them if it hadn't been for this damn Croatian officer. Don't worry. We'll get there. My dear ladies and gentlemen, wounded heroes and healing nuns, the next number requires your total attention and absolute silence. Even the slightest noise disturbs the steadiness of the knife-thrower's hand. Please, welcome the artists. A little round of applause. That's it. Bravo! Thank you. She is standing there as if she wanted to die. Don't be afraid, daddy. Bobó knows everything. What an idiot. I bet he can't even hit a woman straight. Not even with a knife. See? I was right. Dear ladies and gentlemen. I'm sure you're all well acquainted with the noble sport of wrestling. Our gladiators are now going to display their might. I must be satisfied as referee, as neither of them dares to fight me. Gentlemen, the floor is yours. Let us begin, please go ahead. Don't hesitate, go. Grab him now! Very good. Listen, it's very easy. All you have to do is try. The doctor forbade me to lift anything heavier than a suitcase. A suitcase... This weighs a 100 kilos. At first you just lift is slowly, you struggle to lift it up. They see the tremendous effort on your face, and then suddenly you push it up! That's it. Now you try it. Now grab him! Go on! Bravo! Come here, you won. Bravo! A hundred dinars for the person who dares to wrestle with the winner! Please, come out anyone who dares for a 100 dinars! Come on heroes, soldiers! Are you kidding? You want to wrestle with injured people? There are fit people here, too. Captain, I'll teach him a lesson. Nobody? Well, there's someone! Come on, dear hero, don't be afraid. You can win 100 dinars. Very well. Nice to meet you. Come here. Get down to it. Don't let go of him. Now it's good, very well. You almost did it. That's it! Bravo! Pull the corset. Go get ready for the next number. A round of applause for the winner! Cheating! Music! Carlotta, the queen of tightrope! The lady needs crutches, not a parasol! Leave me, Bobó, everything's all right. Leave me alone, Bobó. Leave me alone, son. Fuck her instead of squeezing! I'll buy you a beer. Bobó! Bobó! Come back! Bobó! Bring him back! Bobó! Don't do it! Bring him back! Bobó! My little Bobó! Bobó! You're going to be OK. Doctor, do something. It's the boy's fault. I had to protect my man. - Is he your son? - It's none of your business. You've had your show. What else do you want? How did you get here? Who gave you permission? The German authorities. Interesting. Bring the bag with the papers. We're all right. Our papers are in order. You can show your papers to our authorities. You're under arrest! Bring them in, all of them! This one, too. Put him on a stretcher. Our colleagues are waiting. Let's go. I don't like to be dragged. Jews, step out! Take off your trousers. We'll see. Underpants, too. Faster! Don't hide it. Hands to your thighs! Well, well... we've never had a Jewish clown before. You, over there! You're staying here. Look at that. You're not a Jew! - Or did they forget to circumcise you? - No, I'm not a Jew. I pretended to be a Jew, because I wanted to join the circus. If you're not a Jew then what are you doing here? Are you a spy, a deserter or a communist? No, I'm a businessman. My money's abroad, I tried to get it. What about your friends? My friends? They're not my friends. I suspected them right from the beginning. Especially that woman. What was I supposed to do? I was at their mercy. Put on your clothes. Their papers. They are forged evidently. I'll take the necessary steps. Put the Jews with the Jews. And the rest with the Gypsies. Get moving! Hurry up! Thank you very, very much. Bloody phony Jew! He'll sell us all out. He told me I could be his driver when we get to Zurich. If I could get my hands around that hairy neck of his, he'd need no driver, only a hearse! Bobó, my little Bobó! Doctor! Doctor, you'll save him, right? Save him! Please, save him! He must be operated on. - He should be taken to the hospital. - I won't give him to anyone. You will operate on him. With what, Carlotta? My things are in the wagon. I won't let them take him to the hospital. They'll keep him there even if he gets well, they will certify him. He's finished without me. I am everything to him. I am taking him with me. American paratroopers! Step out! Move! You, too! And you, too! I said, you too, didn't you hear? Get your hands off of me! I'm coming. Bobó... Please, take care of him. You'll operate on him. I'll get your things for you. She's gone mad. We've been here for five days. It's a bit uncomfortable but you get used to it. They'll let us go home soon. Where are you from? We're all going the same way. Those three bridges are important to the guerrillas' supply routes. We must blow them up. Each day we waste is another day for them to transport supplies. Please order the Croatian Headquarters to let the circus move on. Only the doctor stays. The warrant identifies him beyond doubt. Since he is a Wehrmacht officer, it's your concern, colonel. I find it hard to believe that an officer chose this very adventurous way to escape even if he is running for his life. If they're closing in on you, any way is better than the rope. And he chose the best way without even knowing. The Croats themselves don't know that this little flea circus is carrying two so-called American paratroopers for the partisans with the help of the Gestapo. And if this crazy performance hadn't have ended in a scandal, we'd be over the border by now. Do you trust this woman so much? At first she tried to smuggle out people in her circus on her own. We caught her. She chose between the rope and the Gestapo's offer. She is free to smuggle out a few guests who pay if she undertakes to take with her several people who are important to us. The credibility of those Jews, deserters, communists and who knows what else helped our people to move beyond the guerrilla front lines. Everything has worked out well so far. The big fish always get caught, anyway. They're listed in our files, like doctor Griefahn. And now, call in the woman, please. We've told the colonel everything. He also knows that you're an important and trustworthy ally. You may have your son operated on in the hospital. That's very kind of you. I know you mean well, but... I can't leave my son alone. He has a good doctor. Which reminds me... This man... this doctor... How did he get into your circus? They told me in Budapest he was a Jew, a good man, trying to save his child. But why... Why are you asking me this? What do you want from him? We? Nothing. The colonel would like to talk to him. What do you want? My son needs him. Don't worry. Your son will be all right. We all understand that you're worried about your son. It's only natural. The colonel understands, too, he also has children. Right, colonel? But don't let him throw knives at the guerrillas, because they don't understand such humour. Shall we go then? Heil! Griefhan Günter. - Born... - Colonel! - May I say something? - Don't say anything. Keep it to yourself. I'm doing the same. Bobó, my little one, I'm here. The doctor will soon be here. Doctor! Where's the doctor? Doctor Griefahn! Doctor Griefahn! Move! Hurry up! Move! Get on that wagon! Where's the doctor? Who's taken him away? - German Headquarters. - That can't be true! Get on your wagons, everyone! Get moving! Come on! How dare you! This can't be true! Tell me this isn't true! You are killing my son. You know you're killing him. You know it! You are all murderers! Killers! Bloody killers! We should talk to her while she hasn't completely lost it. Get moving! What's this playing around? It's a war game. They pull the string and we dance. Give me those civilian clothes, will you? Thank you. Try to get some sleep. You know I'll look after you till you meet again. In Lisbon? Yes. In Lisbon. He'll get treatment in a few hours' time. We know that you're worried about him, that you shouted. What else do you want? Don't make any more mistakes. We don't know what's going to happen in the next few hours. But whatever is going to happen, you, your son and us, it's all the same. What if he dies? We've thought about that. But... if you betray us and we are hanged, you'll hang on the next tree over. I mean if you talk, we'll talk as well. Can I bandage him? Go! Giddy up! Giddy up! Rudi! Move! Rudi! Come. Get out! You're coming with me. Is this what you wanted? Good luck. Good bye. And he also said once that it was not wars that had to be won, but peace. Created by:
