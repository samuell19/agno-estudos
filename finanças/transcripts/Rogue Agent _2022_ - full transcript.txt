[projector rattling] [boing] [train horn blares] [radio chatter] [birdsong] [newsreader] The police investigation continues at Trent Hamilton Agricultural College in Shropshire, after one of its students was arrested for membership of the IRA. The authorities are concerned that Kevin Barry, 22, from County Tyrone, may have been part of a wider IRA cell operating in the area. Just drive on through, sir. [woman] There's a trick that spies use. He told me they learn it on their first day of training. [rattles handle] [knocks] If you want to make an instant connection with someone, look into their eyes, just long enough to register their eye color. - Hi. - Hi. Uh… I'm here about the job. - Yeah. Come in. - Thanks. He said it works every time. [band playing rock music] [laughter and cheering] He learned how to hide in plain sight. How to read people. - [song ends] - [cheering and whistling] [man] Thank you! Thank you so much! [pool balls click] Are you sure I can't buy you a drink? I don't drink. [man] Uh… He learned how to recruit the right people. Listen, Ian. There is something I've been meaning to talk to you about. - Yeah? - Yeah. You and your friends. Uh… Not here, though. How to persuade them. You're a spy? [sighs] I… I'm an officer in the British security services. The IRA cell have been installed here at Trent Hamilton for over a year. They are posing as students. Stealing fertilizer to create bombs. As you know, one of them was recently caught back in Ireland, trying to blow up a police station. And the others are still here, on active service. [Ian] Bloody hell. [woman 2] Can't believe this is happening. [woman 1] But… [sighs] Sorry. What can we do about it? Plenty. Get close to them in ways that I can't. Find out things that could really help our investigation. No. I'm sorry, no. Sophie. Sit down. [gasps] Sit. [sighs] If you help me do my job, it will save lives. I promise you that. Men. Women. Children. [sighs] [church bell ringing] [man] Just read… - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - How you doing? - [Irish accent] Grand. You? - Good. [woman] He said that espionage is storytelling. [all] Sláinte! And everyone has a story they want to be told. Never heard of it. Tonight is the night. Tonight, we put into practice everything I have taught you. Over the last three months. And remember, this is not a test. There is no room for failure. Okay? Sophie, Mae. What's your role? To clear the house. Get everyone out. - But there's a moment you have to act. - Well, listen! - And that is the moment of maximum risk. - On that note, I have an announcement. So I think we should all go across the road to the Swan, where I'll buy everyone a round. - Yes! - [cheering] And that's an offer we can't refuse. Let's go! Let's go! Come on! In that world, duplicity is a necessity. Niall, I'm gonna use your toilet. - Go in the pub. - Mate, I'm bursting. - I'll follow you over in a sec. - Fine. It's upstairs. - Cool. Ready? - We ready? - Let's go, guys! - Let's go. [Sophie giggles] - [man] I left my jacket here. - You're paranoid. I don't like that, there's no surprise. - Then I can surprise you. - Surprise me! - Nah, I'm not doing that. - Oh, yeah! - [hums] - Can you get me a pint of water? But the greater the ruse, the bigger the risk. [singing and laughter] Oh shit. I forgot my wallet. - Doesn't matter. I'm buying. - I'll just be a minute. - You can just get it later. - It's fine, honestly. Oh, come on. See you. [dog barking] [front door closes] [sighs] [toilet flushing] You didn't take a shit, did you? [chuckles] [buzz of conversation] Yeah, there was nothing there. Thank you. - Cheers, everyone. - Cheers. His world was thrilling and mysterious. But it came at a cost. [door opens] [spy] Sophie. Sophie. Sophie, get up. Get up! - What? - We've been compromised. We're extracting. You need to get up. - What? - They know about us. About you. Okay? They know. [gasps] Sophie... No! You do not have a choice. They could be here any second. Get up. Come on. - [Sophie gasping] - [dog barking] [woman] A cost to him… And to others. - What happens now? - I don't know. - You don't know? - [spy] I don't know. I never had an agent compromised before. But I promise you, I will protect you. [starts engine] [breathing heavily] I will keep you safe. [woman] Anyone who entered that world left behind the lives they had before. People they once were. That was the price they had to pay. [car horn blares] So you have it? And what does it say? Perfect. Oh, yeah. Usual place. [spy] No, she's a beautiful car. Beautiful. She won't let you down. She's simple, elegant. - You've made the right decision. - Mmm. [spy] Believe me. It's a whole new world. [chuckles] [horns blaring] Thank you. So, Andrew, where is she? You know what the trains are like. - Come on. - [boss] She travels by train? [Andrew] Alice, welcome. [boss] Nice of you to join us. There's been a development. An email chain between senior managers at the bank proving they did indeed verbally agree with you to waive the security over the assets. An agreement that they not only failed to disclose, but it now seems, have actively tried to cover up, which is potentially criminal on their part. Certainly, it blows their case out of the water. - How did we… - [chuckling] Aaah! I rather feel a celebration is in order. [loud laughter] I must say, Alice, I'm most impressed. Thank you. And you're also not a bad lawyer. [men laughing] - [chuckles] - [boss] I'm joking! I'm joking! Sam! More drinks. - Another bottle of Bollinger. - [murmurs] Are you okay? [security door rattling] Hi there. I saw you walking past this morning. In fact, I see you most mornings. Oh, fuck off, mate. [train departing] [chuckles] [train horn sounds] [alarm beeping] [groans softly] - [alarm stops] - [sighs] - [dog barking] - [birdsong] [groans] Oh God. [sighs] [train passing] [phone ringing] [sighs] Hi. - Hi. - Look. I wanted to apologize for last night. - I was rude. - No, no, it was, uh… it was my fault. You must get completely fed up with men coming up and talking to you all the time. I apologize. It won't happen again. Okay. Well, good. On a scale of one to ten, how hungover are you? [sighs] Fourteen. And you're gonna get the Tube on a hot summer's day like today? - Hey, I'll give you a lift. - What? I'll tell the manager you want a test drive. No, no, I... I really don't think that... I'll put the roof down. If you wanna puke, you can just do it over the side. - Preferably on a cyclist. - [chuckles] Take the BMW.

That must have been difficult. You sort of get used to it, I guess. And you weren't tempted by the military life yourself? No, God no.

I love lighthouses. [gulls calling] [both chuckle] [distant alarm bell ringing] [laughs] Wow. - [Robert] Yeah. - [gasps] This lighthouse was here way before any of those skyscrapers were, and it'll probably be here long after they're gone. You think so? Yeah. I hope so. [Alice giggles] [laughs] [shower running] [sighs] [phone vibrating] Sophie? [door opens] [Robert] Okay. Right, I'm really sorry.

I got you some, uh… some proper grub. Spaghetti and… Bolognese. Thank you. No credit history at all? [man] Nothing. And no marriage certificate. In terms of public records, Robert Hansen is a ghost. And what does that tell you? Nothing good. Okay. Thank you. [bell rings] Ooh, I think this is us. Great. How was work? I didn't see you when I passed this morning. Thank you. Thanks. Um… Work… Uh, yeah, I guess I was on a... on a test drive. - Sell many cars? - Two. Not a bad day at the office. How about you? The usual. How's your dad? He's better, thank you. Yeah. He, um… he came home, which is great. Such a relief. Yeah. [chuckles] Everything all right? Everything's great. Give me a chip. - One. No more. - [laughs] [distant sirens wailing] You're not sure about me. What? You have reservations. Questions. I had you checked out. You did what? You know I'm a litigation solicitor. We have people who do client checks for us. Credit history. That sort of thing. Sorry, you put a private investigator onto me? Yes, I did. And as far as he can see, you don't exist. - Right. - Yeah. - Impressive. - Yeah, isn't it? Well… Technically, that's right. I don't exist. Or rather, the name that you have been searching for doesn't exist. Alice, Robert Hansen is an alias. My real name is Robert Freegard. - Alice, wait. - Get the fuck off me. Wait. Jesus, give me a second. - You're married, aren't you? - No, I'm not married. - [sighs] - Alice, please. [Alice sighs] [sighs] I am an officer in the British security services. MI5. - You work in a car showroom. - That's my cover right now. - I can't tell you any more than that. - [laughs] What? Come on. No, I'm sorry, no. Bullshit. - It's the truth. - Well, then, who's Sophie? How do you know about her? She rang your phone when you were in the shower. She works with me. I supervise her on a job. She's undercover as well, like me, okay? We're on the same investigation. Alice, listen, I know this is a shock, but it's the truth. I... [sighs] I just… A spy? [chuckles softly] No. You... you told me… You said that you could never kill anyone. [chuckles] I don't think I could. I... I never have, either. - Do you have a gun? - No, it's not like the movies. [scoffs] Listen, now that I've told you all this, I have to let my superiors know, okay? Means you're gonna be vetted. Vetted? It just means they're gonna do some basic inquiries into your life. It's a pain in the arse, but it won't take long. All long-term partners have to be vetted.

Kids? You wanna have kids? Do you? - Yeah. - [laughs] Five years' time, I wanna be running my own business, with a kid. Maybe two. So you'd leave the service? Mmm… Not straightaway. But I think I've done my bit. It's time for a change. What kind of business? Car leasing. - Really? [laughs] - Yeah. - Car leasing? - Yeah, the rich don't buy cars anymore. They do it on short-term rentals. That way, when they get bored, they can move on. [laughs] promise you, there is a fortune to be made leasing cars. [chuckles] - Look at you and all your plans. - Mmm. - Hey, a man has gotta have a plan. - A man does. - A man does. - A man does. [Robert chuckles] God, you're so beautiful. - Oh! Piss off! - Mmm! - Do you know what? - No - Goodbye! - No! [laughing] So, Robert, you're a brave man if you're willing to do battle with our Alice on a daily basis. - Oh, hilarious. - [chuckles] [both laugh] I, uh… I think I've got the measure of her. So, how is the motor business these days? You know, it couldn't be better. [father] It'll all end in tears. You mark my words. - Too much debt around. - I don't know about that. Make hay while the sun shines, as they say. [Alice] Thank you. [mother] And what are your plans for the future? - Mum! - We're not asking him to marry you, Al. We're just asking what his plans are. - Dad! - [Robert] It's okay. Uh, well, Madeleine, my plans are, um… My plans are to make the most of things. Right. Actually, Alice and I are thinking about starting a little business together. Leasing cars. What? No, Alice is a lawyer. She's a bloody good one. I'm not leaving my job, Dad. It's just a side project. Side project? You're an entrepreneur, aren't you, Richard? You can't blame us for trying. [sighs] Everyone always wants more than what's in front of them, don't they? You know, I don't think it is about wanting more, at least not materially. What is it about, then? [Robert] Oh, it's about… Oh, it's about freedom. [sighs] - [horns blaring] - [Robert] Oh my God! - They hated me. - [Alice laughs] No, my mum liked you. But, yeah, Dad hated you. - Yeah. I talk too much. - [laughs] So does he. - Two bloody stags in a clearing. - [chuckles] Yeah. - My antlers are bigger than his, though. - [laughs] [Robert chuckles] Maybe he is right about the business. Maybe we should just stay in our lane, eh? No! We should do it. We should. - Yeah? - Yeah. - [both chuckling] - Oh! - [kisses] Aah! Okay, we're doing it. - Yeah. Don't listen to my dad. [train passing] - It's time to move on. - Now? Now. - What about my stuff? - Leave it. [sighs] Have we been compromised? - I was so careful. - No. [inhales] No, you, uh… You got the place. - On the field officer training program. - What? [sobs] - [chuckles] You've been selected. - What? - [sobs] - [laughs] - [gasps] Oh my God. - Your days of being a freelancer are over. [laughs] Now, listen. It doesn't start for a little while. I'll find you somewhere to stay until then. - [sighs] It is happening. - [sobbing] Hey. Come on. [sniffles] Sorry. Congratulations, Sophie. - Nobody deserves this more than you. - [laughs] [both laughing] [gasps] Oh my God. Come on. Let's go. - [kids yelling] - [whistle blows] [distant siren wailing] - I didn't wanna talk over the phone. - Okay. This guy you asked me to check out, the ghost. Oh, yeah. No, that's all been resolved. Oh. Well, I managed to do a little bit more digging. Go on. So, we know Robert Hansen doesn't exist, not officially. But I did find, in the court records, a couple of minor judgments against a Robert Hansen-Freegard. Nothing serious, mind you, but, well, I like to do a thorough job, so I ran all the iterations. Robert Hansen, Robert Hansen-Freegard, and Robert Freegard. Court documents? Sealed court documents, no less. They're relating to someone called Robert Freegard. Date of birth, May 21st, 1967. 1991, he had a brush with the court. Up in front of a judge, on the receiving end of a non-molestation order. A few years later, he successfully had that set aside. Or somebody did. Wh... what was it about? The allegation was for stalking and harassment of a young woman. Julie Harper. Wouldn't leave her alone. Made her life hell, it seems. I couldn't find the girl, but I managed to get a phone number for a Bridget Harper, who I'm pretty sure is her mother. Anything else? No. No, thank you. [sighs] [Robert sighs] - How was work? - Good. Good Is everything okay? Great. [Robert chuckles] Have you heard from my employers yet? - Your employers? - Yeah. They haven't tried to shit-test you, have they? "Shit-test"? Throw some crap at you. Something unexpected. See if it sticks. It helps them draw up a psych profile of you. What do you mean, throw some crap? Pfft. I don't know. They can be pretty creative. They don't always do it, so, uh… forget I said anything. No, um… I mean, what... what kind of crap? Um… [sighs] I don't know. Some bullshit about me. Something to throw you off guard. Test your loyalty to me. [laughs] Honestly, they probably won't do it. And even if they did, I know that you would handle it perfectly, so forget I said it. Ready. Here we go. [chuckles] - Try this. - Mmm! There was actually one more thing I wanted to say to you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Um… [tuts] [sighs] I love you. Right, let's eat. [sighs]This is the best bolognese that you have ever eaten. I promise you that. Mmm. [sighs] Uh [sighs] Okay, then. Shit-test me. - [dialing] - [sighs] [ringing tone] - [woman] Hello? - Hello. Mrs. Harper? That's right. How can I help you? Hi, uh, my name's Alice Archer. I'm sorry to bother you. Uh... I need to talk to you about someone your daughter used to know. His name is Robert Freegard. [Bridget gasps] Mrs. Harper? Hey, babe. Ooh, you look incredible. [groans] This is nice. I was speaking to someone that used to know you today. She told me the most extraordinary story. Oh? Bridget Harper. Mother of Julie Harper? She told me that, years ago, you and Julie had a whirlwind romance. She borrowed 20 grand off her parents to get married, but it never happened. [chuckles] - I did tell you this was gonna happen. - Oh, fuck off. There was a court case. You harassed her. - Are you telling me this is all made up? - Not all of it, no. Ahem… [laughs] Julie was my first girlfriend. Thought I loved her. Maybe I did. I don't know. Uh… She drank, a lot. At first, I excused it, thought it was normal, but it wasn't. She was, uh… she was an alcoholic. It was… It was horrible. She's actually the reason I gave up drinking. Eventually, I persuaded her to go into rehab. We found a place. It was private, expensive. She borrowed the money off her parents, but she never told them why she needed it. Then the night before she was meant to go, she just disappeared. I guess she really didn't want to give up drinking. I tried to find her, of course I did. And yeah. Yeah, she complained to the police to keep me away. I went to court. Judge threw it out in about five minutes flat. This came out in my clearance interviews when I applied for the service. That's why it's coming up. They use this when they do this kind of thing. - But the woman I spoke to... - Is Bridget, and, yes, she's real. This is what she really thinks. I can't change her mind. No one will. Oh, and by the way, the person who gave you all this information? They're working for us. I imagine, as a freelancer. But why? - I mean, why? - To see if you'll trust me in a crisis. [sighs] [chuckles] Where are you going? Uh, I'm gonna work out if I wanna spend the rest of my life with someone whose job has turned them into a cynical, entitled bitch. [phone rings] Hello? [man] Hello. Is this Alice Archer? Yes. I'm sorry to bother you, but I was given your number earlier today by Bridget Harper. I'm calling in relation to Robert Freegard. Who is this? My name is Paul Jones. Robert Freegard has… Well, he has kidnapped my daughter, Sophie. I'm sorry, but you need to stop this now. This is an infringement of my privacy and that of my partner. This is obscene. [sighs] [phone rings] [horse neighs] [Paul] That's just before she went to college. Before it all happened. And so she just disappeared? Her, another girl, and a young man called Ian Preston. His people are from Burley Vale. He came home, eventually. Sophie didn't. Obviously, we involved the police. After a few days, she called. [sighs] She said that she was safe, that they were doing something important, and that they would be gone for some time. The police lost interest after that. So why do you say she was kidnapped? Do you think she was making the call under duress? Not duress exactly. More like… [sighs] More like what? He brainwashed her. - Where are we? - One last mission. - [gasps] But I thought... - Hey. No questions. [Paul] Of course I tried to find them. I traced her credit card withdrawals all over the country. But I was always two steps behind. I thought, if only I could see her face-to-face, I could jolt her out of this madness, but I never could. It was a phone call here, a letter there. Never asking how we were. Never saying she missed us. - Just only ever asking for money. - Money? That's all she ever wanted. In the end, she asked for her share of the inheritance. She wanted it now. Before we died. And did you give her the money? [Paul sighs] Yes. I realize now it was the wrong thing to do. How much did you end up giving her? About £300,000. If there's any way you could get him to lead you to her, any way at all… Ah… I mean, I… I don't really… - How? - [Paul] You're still close to him. If you could keep it that way a while longer, maybe he could tell you where she is. Find something out, anything. I, uh... I can't promise anything. I've got so much to think about. Thank you. And… I'm sorry. Do you believe in God, Miss Archer? And the devil? I, uh… I don't really think about it. Well, I do. I believe that some people have been put on this Earth to be the agents of one or the other. Robert Freegard is such an agent, and he's not the Lord's. Alice Archer. Alice Archer.
