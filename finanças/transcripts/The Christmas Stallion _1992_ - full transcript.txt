(MultiCom Jingle) (vibrant music) - [Gwen] Woo! Woo! - Get up! - Woo! - [Male Speaker] Get up! (horse grunts) - Woo, woo, woo! Woo! Come on, come on! Woo! Come on! - [Male Speaker] Come on, come on. - Oh, not again, not today. (horse neighs) Come on! - Hey, Bonnie's gone. - Hey, hey! This is my bloody road. - Oh, (mumbles). Are you satisfied now? - Keep him under control. And you're too old, you should quit. Come on, old guy, huh? Don't be such an old (mumbles). Let me buy the farm. - Not over my dead body. - They better get that horse back. That mountain's mine and your grazing rights come to an end. - I don't need you to tell me what my grazing rights are. - No, but you need some lessons in business studies. - Yeah, well coming from you, Howard, I take that as a compliment. - Can't stop progress, boy. The sooner you're out of my way, the better. - Sorry about the fuss. - It's OK. Does Howard good to be kept waiting. Teach him a little humility. Where's your grandfather gone? - He's gone after Bonnie. Thanks, Vickie. All that fuss spooked her back onto the moor. I think Howard did it on purpose. He knows she's carrying Mabon's foal and how valuable she is. - How is he? - Granddad, he's fine. A bit tired maybe. - Want some help? - Don't I always. (suspenseful music) (sheep bleating) (tires screeching) (horn honks) (horse neighs) - Mabon, steady, boy. (horn honks) Steady, boy. (horse neighs) - Put her in this one. - Howard isn't the kind of man who learns lessons. He doesn't want to learn. If he was, he'd stop pestering your grandfather for the farm. - Come on. - He must know by now Dai isn't going to sell, nor is he gonna give up his grazing rights. - He just thinks it's a question of more money. (suspenseful music) Granddad. (somber music) - I'd forgotten it was Dai's funeral today. - Have you gone to pay your respects? - I really don't think-- - You have to now. - I suppose so. But I imagine I'm the last person she wants to see today. (suspenseful music) - Gwen, Nerys, I'd like to say how sorry I am, and if there's anything I can do. - Don't you think you've done enough already? (suspenseful music) - [Nerys] I thought he'd be on time today of all days. - Well, he did have a long way to come after all. - I know, I know. I just don't know what to do, Sam. He's been away from home such a long time. - He came back for Will and Ann's funeral. - Only for a couple of days. It'll break Gwen's heart if he decides to sell. I mean, why didn't Dai make me her guardian? I mean, why Alan, for heaven's sake? - He's her uncle, Nerys. Give him time. Who knows, he may not sell. You know Alan after all. This place is in his blood. He's Dai's son. - [Nerys] He's got a strange way of showing it. - Who said the Davies' were short on pride? It takes two to make an argument, Nerys. You can't blame Dai or Alan. - No, I suppose not. I'll go and see if Gwen's OK. - Remember, give it time. Don't jump to any conclusions. - [Alan] Come one, come on, come on. - Cute. - [Alan] We haven't got time for cute. - Don't you worry about Gwen now. She'll be fine. - You listen to her, Nerys. She may be an old gossip, but-- - Hey. - But she is right. You've done a good job bringing up Gwen. Her own mother couldn't have done better. She'll be fine. - If you want my opinion, she'd be better if that uncle of hers had deigned to turn up on time. Missing his father's funeral? I ask you. - [Gwen] I'm just going to freshen up, OK? - Sure. - Is she OK? - Just tired. She'll be fine. - Well, I'm with Gwen. You can count on me if there's anything needs doing. - That's great, Gwilyn, but let's just see how things go, shall we? He's not even here yet. (suspenseful music) (door knocking) Can I come in? (somber music) I haven't done this for a long time. You have hair just like your mother's. She'd have been really proud of you today. - What about you? - Oh, I'm very proud of you, my darling. - I've never thanked you for looking after me. Not once in all these years. I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry. - First mom and dad. Now Granddad. You're all I have left. - You have Alan. - Him? He's no better than Howard. And I bet he's glad Granddad's dead, too. - That's unworthy of you, Gwen. - I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. It's just that everything's in such a mess. I haven't met him and he's supposed to tell me what to do. - Don't jump to conclusions, Gwen. Try and get on with him for your own sake, please. Give him time. - You OK? - Fine. - Is something wrong? - No, everything's fine. It's been a long day, that's all. I have to go feed the horses. - [Gwilyn] I'll give you a hand. - No, it's OK. I'll be quicker on my own. - What if I come round later? Say, in an hour? I could help with the cleaning up. - No, I'm all right, really. Maybe tomorrow, yeah? (peaceful music) (engine roars) - [Alan] Great, I knew we'd be late. (dog barks) (dog growls) - Hey, well, someone is here. Hello, boy. What's his name? - I have no idea. Watch it, (speaking in foreign language). - It's only a little mud. Would you look at that. A real live Lassie. - Anybody'd think you'd never seen a dog before. - [Gwen] Stop, boy. - [Cliff] Who's that over there? - Behave, behave. Behave. Oh, you're here. I didn't hear the car. - Come on in. (mischievous music) - Hi. - Hi, I'm Cliff, Alan's stepson. - Nerys, Nerys Jones. - Hi, how're you doing? - Very good, how are you? - Alan. - Nerys, Sam. I'm sorry we're late-- - Let's not go into that now, shall we? You must be tired. Here, let me take that. Gwen, why don't you show them up to their rooms whilst I make us all a cup of tea. - Gwen, I'm really sorry. - Granddad always said you were a busy man. (somber music) That's telling him. - Frankly, I can't see the department's problem. You see, there's nothing up there except some sheep. - Even so, the chance of getting permission to do anything more than widening the existing track is pretty remote. Your access is lousy, and you're talking of double or even tripling the through traffic. - If that's the worst of the problems, it should be plain sailing, huh, Jack? - He's beautiful, what's his name? - Cross Mabon. - Oh. - Mabon, it's Welsh. It means promised son. Cross is just our trade name. It means moorland. (horse neighs) - So you washed the mud off then? There's always a new passion. You can't tell these days. (horse neighs) - I must've looked pretty stupid. - Nah, what's a little mud between friends? I thought you looked kind of cute. - I didn't want to look cute. I wanted to look cool. - Who is he? - Sam. He takes care of the sheep. He's just part of the furniture. - An antique. - Do you have any more like Mabon? - No, not yet, but one day. Whoa, boy. His foal's due soon. Mabon's a champion. The best we've ever had. Granddad was really proud of him. He could turn this place around if he was given the chance. - [Cliff] I can see why. He's beautiful. - Can you ride? - A bit. Alan tried to teach me when I was a kid. - I'm surprised he had the time. All I ever had was postcards. - He's not that bad, you know. At least he sent you postcards. (gentle music) Gwen, someone here to see you. - Actually, I'm here to see Mr. Davies. Are you... - His stepson, Cliff Dean. - Christopher Howard. - Alan Davies. What can I do for you, Mr. Howard? - I want to buy the farm. Your niece has probably explained, and under the terms of the will, I believe you're responsible. - I'm not selling. - Gwen. - I'm not selling. - I've offered a very good price, Mr. Davies. You won't get a better one out here. I don't need the stock. You can sell that separately. Might be worth a bit. - Mr. Howard, the farm's not for sale. Not now, not ever. - Of course it is, girl. What else will you do with this old place? - [Alan] I think we should talk about this later. - My card, Mr. Davies. We're holding a meeting in the club tomorrow. I own the country club. Why don't you turn up and see what I have in mind for the old place? - [Gwen] I knew it. - Do you play golf? - Mm-mm. - Pity. Till tomorrow then. - So what's with her? She's really annoyed with you. And what did he mean about the will? - Dai made me her guardian, among other things. If I say she has to sell, she has to sell. - Yeah, but you wouldn't, would you? Not if she didn't want to. - Like the man said, what else is she gonna do with the place? - Oh, that's great. Just great. Thanks for telling me. - Cliff. - Gwen. Gwen. (mysterious music) Gwen? Gwen. (mysterious music) Gwen? I've been looking all over for you. He only wants to do what's best for you, you know? - Who are you, the Alan Davies fan club? We could make a go of this farm, you know? We really could. Mabon's brilliant. He could win every prize there is if he only had the chance. Ty'n Horse Stud could mean something again. Granddad waited years for a chance like this, and now he's going to ruin it. He's going to sell, I know it. I just don't believe Granddad's will. My God, Alan's only been home once in 20 years, and that was when my parents were killed. And he couldn't even stay then. He hurt Granddad so much. I just don't understand why he put him in charge. Why? It doesn't make any sense. - I don't know. - Well, if he thinks I'm going to give up without a fight, he's got another thing coming. There's a show on next week. A race, and Mabon's going to win. He's got to win. (gentle music) - Come on, come on. (engine roars) (speaking in foreign language) - Come on then. - [Nerys] Who do you play scrabble with? - [Girl] My dad. - Your dad, and what about your little brother? - Good, very good. - How good of you to come. Go back to your mommy, dear. It is a good idea. - Maybe. - Times change. Life goes on. We cannot all dwell in the past. Look, Nerys, people listen to you. All I ask is you hear what I have to say before you make up your mind. I'm ready to start now. Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention. Thank you for coming. I'm very pleased that you could join us today. - You're just in time. Councillor Howard is about to tell us what a bright future we would have. - I just wanted the opportunity to unveil, so to speak, personally our plans at Moorland Leisure to dispel some of the wilder rumors. Let me show you what I mean. The moors. Now we are here at the... The country club. We have the stream, the tennis courts, the golf course, and, of course, Dai's farm. Now a major leisure and sports complex right here along (mumbles). Tourists, jobs. An economic and social boost to the valley. We will open up all the moors. Pony trekking, grouse shooting, an 18 hole golf course instead of nine. Obviously, there's a price to be paid. Some things will change. But as you see, very few will be affected. But all of us, all of us will benefit. - A way of life is harder to sweep away than figures on a model, Mr. Howard. Some of us will-- - I'm talking about progress, Gwen. If we don't allow things to grow, they wither away and die. - Yes, but if you make these changes, the village might as well be dead because it won't be the same. - Not all change is bad. What about you, Alan? I'm sure that living in America must've given you a wider perspective. What do you think? - I've heard enough of him. Let's have a sandwich. - [Chris] Are they for the better or for the worse? - Hey, watch this. - Other people in this village are different. - Well, I don't see how my opinion. (alarm rings) - Don't leave, it's the alarm. Hang on there now, ladies and gentlemen. Just hang on. - It was an accident. - Just hang on. - Sam. - Hold on a minute now. - [Male Speaker] Do something, Chris. Switch it off. Everyone's going. - It's just the alarm. Ladies and gentlemen, just stay calm. - Brilliant, that was great. - Don't look at me, I didn't do anything. - Well, no, you didn't have a stick, did you? - Did you see his face? It was brilliant. - I'll be out at the farm tomorrow. See you then, huh? - So what do you think? - Frankly, I don't care one way or the other. My only concern right now is Gwen's future. - What, no opinion at all? - You're as bad as Howard putting me on the spot. My opinion's irrelevant. I don't live here. - Amazing. This whole project's riding on your decision, and you've got no opinion. I mean, don't you care what happens? - Of course, I care. I care about doing right by Gwen and by Dai. It's not my problem to worry about the whole valley. I just got here a couple of days ago. I thought the real issue was Gwen's future, not Howard and his plans. - You're right. I'm sorry. It's Howard. He just makes me so angry. (Sam laughs) - What's the joke, what's he say? - He said the horses like you. - Still speak Welsh then, do you? - Enough, I guess. A bit rusty. - There you go. Racing shoes. Be a shame to see the old place close after all these years. Old Mabon's bloodline goes way back. You could do worse than ty'n horse, you know? (gentle harp music) - Will you sell? - I don't know. His offer's a bloody good one. - The golf club's OK as far as it goes, I suppose. I don't know. And I don't like what he's doing to this valley. - Why not? - I can't explain it. Not really. It's what I feel. We're a working community. Howard wants to turn us into a summer dormitory. I have no objection to sharing the place. But I do object to having to change our whole way of life in order to do it. - I thought you needed the jobs. - We're farmers. What do we know about tourists? They'll bring in their own people to take care of the moor. Our young people will still be moving away, and yet we will have lost what makes us what we are. - Well, without Ty'n Rhos he's got nothing. - What do you mean? - Shall we? I've been doing some checking. It seems there's very little chance that they're getting permission to build except on a site that's already developed. Howard needs the adjacent land and better access. We don't sell him Ty'n Rhos, he doesn't get his leisure center. - No wonder he's so anxious. He must be desperate. Coffee? - [Alan] We're not desperate. (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) - [Gwen] You stay here, OK? I have to check the horses. - OK. (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) (horse neighs) - I want to thank you. - Thank me, what for? - For taking care of Gwen. For looking out for the old man. - Seems to be the week for thank yous. You didn't have to thank me. I'm her godmother. Her mother was my best friend. What was I supposed to do, look the other way? - The way I did? - I didn't mean it that way. - I know. But I shouldn't have stayed away, not after Will and Ann were killed. - You could've made up with Dai, you know? 20 years is a long time for grown men to hold a grudge. - I know. We almost did, in fact. I came home for Will's funeral, remember? I always seem to be coming home to funerals. We should've made it up. It was stupid to let it go on so long. I guess we thought there'd be time. Now it's too late. - No, it isn't. - Meaning? - Dai made you Gwen's guardian. He's trusting you to look out for her, Alan. He's got you back where you belong and nothing else would have. It's his way of saying he's sorry. We're a lot of things, Alan Davies. Our roots included. You shouldn't keep denying them, especially when the argument's over. - [Cliff] What is it? - Phone's dead. Bonnie's about to foal. She's out of season and it could be a breach. Just don't stand there. Get some towels and some hot water. And some soap. - I'd better go, it's late. But I can't imagine Gwen waiting up for me. Can you? - OK? - OK. Hold her still and keep her calm, OK? Steady. (horse neighs) Steady girl. (peaceful music) Seems to be all right. (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) (gentle music) - Shh, steady girl. Steady. Is she OK? - The foal is coming. Hold her still. (horse neighs) (tree creaks) (tires screeching) - It's not moving. Yeah. (peaceful music) Well done. - Well done, Bonnie. - Busy? Will you do me a favor? Fetch the sheep from the mountain. - Sure. The roof. - Aye, aye. - [Cliff] God, it's cold. - [Nerys] Living in L.A. has made you soft. - [Cliff] I'm starving, when do we eat? Alan's never in L.A. - No? - [Cliff] No, he's all over the place. - Really? - I'm a freelance reporter. Reporters travel. - What do you write? - Whatever. The tin was in the barn. - Yeah. Granddad wanted to do it. (peaceful music) (sheep bleating) - Woo! (sheep bleating) - Looks like we might have snow down at the farm by Christmas. Have you managed to speak to Gwen yet? - Not exactly. Apart from good morning and good night, she's done a good job of avoiding me. - [Nerys] Now is your chance. - Odd that it's just the way I remember it. Even smells the same. Gwen, you're not making this any easier. I'm just trying to decide what's best for you. - How can you decide what's best for me? You don't even know me. - That's the point, I'd like to get to know you if you'll let me. You know, if we sell, you can do anything you want. You can go anywhere you want. - I don't want to go anywhere. I know what I want, Uncle Alan. I've known all my life. Can't you see that? (peaceful music) - All I'm saying is that we should be careful, that's all. Howard is one of us, and if we don't handle it right, our jobs and our reputations are on the line. - [Jack] But you do agree that it's a good idea. - For Howard, of course it's a good idea. I'm not denying that. But I'm not so sure about the village and the compulsive purchases on... - Am I interrupting something? - No. No, we've just finished. (upbeat music) - This is it? - Yeah. What's wrong with it? - You're gonna race in this? - Of course I am. (laughing) Cliff. - Thanks for being here today. - That's OK. Past few days were bound to be a little tough. Give her time. But she seems to have hit it off with Cliff. Not exactly the lifestyle he's used to, is it? You still see his mother? - Not really. She married some jerk in New York. Cliff still sees here, but I don't bother. - [Nerys] New York didn't appeal to him I take it. - I guess not. - He's a nice boy, and he's very found of you. - [Alan] Yeah, he's OK. OK, he's more than OK. But we don't see each other much these days. - So I gathered at lunch. - Yeah, Beth and I used to argue about it all the time, but I never realized my being away bothered them. Now what? Give me your hand. - Don't worry, power cut. There's some candles in the kitchen. - Oh, good. - [Gwen] Come on. - You'll be lucky, that hasn't worked for years. - [Alan] Don't tell me you got rid of the old generator. - No, but it doesn't work anymore. - [Alan] I'll just take a look. - [Nerys] You're wasting your time. It's a rusty old piece of junk. - Hey, Dai and I spent hours installing that rusty old piece of junk. Cliff. - They won't fix it. - I know. Let's have some tea. Oh. - I knew it wouldn't take long. - Gwen, turn the lights off. Let's not spoil their fun. Come on, let's put some decorations up. It's about time we cheer this place up. It's only a week till Christmas. (mischievous music) - Could be. Yes. OK, now hold that right there. - I got it. - Well. - Well, what? - Well, what do you think of your uncle then? - What am I supposed to think of him, Nerys? He turns up after 20 years expecting to tell me what to do. What would you think? - I know it's hard, Gwen, but your grandfather did make him responsible for you. You know, in many ways, he's a lot like Dai. - But does that give him the right to go against Granddad's wishes as well as mine? - No, it doesn't. But it does mean that your grandfather trusted him to do what's right for you. Has he talked to you about it? Have you told him what you want? - He's knows what I want. Maybe he just doesn't understand. - Of course he understands. But it's hard for him, too, you know. He's been away from home such a long time. You're the only family he's got, you know. (mischievous music) (generator whirs) - Hey! - [Cliff] All right! - Don't panic. (generator sparks) (generator sparks) Let's get out of here. (suspenseful music) (screaming) (generator explodes) (laughing) Don't worry, I'll fix it tomorrow. - You look so stupid. - [Cliff] Thanks. (generator pops) - When will you ever learn, Alan Davies? (laughing) Hello, Sam, Peggy. - How're you doing, Sam? - Hang on there. Take these. - I'll be back in a bit. - Cliff. Go and join her. - Have fun. - Glad he came? - Oh, yes. I need someone on my side. - This is Cliff. Jenn, Sandy, Frank, and Gwilyn. He's from America. - Oh, big deal. - Don't mind Gwilyn, he's got bad manners. Fancy a game? - Sure. - This won't take long. - I don't care what he said. We had a deal. I want that planning approval, Jack. I need it, and you owe me. You owe me. - Chris, listen-- - I can't afford any more hiccups! Now you just do your little bit, Councillor, and I'll do mine. ("Silent Night") - [Female Speaker] Come on. - [Female Speaker] Come on, come on, shoot. - Here's comes trouble. Hello, Mr. Howard, how nice to see you. - Nerys, Mr. Davies. - A drink? - Very kind of you. Scotch, please. - Bad day? - Known better. Settling in? - Yes, thanks. I guess you'll be out of the place as soon as Christmas is over. Very good timing with this horse fair next week. You'll be able to get a pretty good price for the stock. - Gwilyn, shoot! - Come on, come on! (cheering) - What do you think of my plans for the complex? - Very interesting. Ambitious. - I'm a very ambitious man, Mr. Davies. Trifle too ambitious for some people, but there we are. - [Male Speaker] Come on! (cheering) (funky music) - The price I'm offering is very fair. Your father was stubborn, clinging to the old way. - Maybe. I haven't had time to check it out. I'm meeting the solicitors tomorrow. (funky music) - Yes! Bad luck, yank. Maybe next time. When will I see you? - I'm not sure. - Don't you want a lift? - I can't, they're waiting. - Well, so what? What about tomorrow then? We'll go for a spin. - OK. (engine roars) (horse neighs) - [Alan] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Having fun? - Where are you off to? - Solicitors. Where is Gwen? - Checking on Bonnie. Look, you're not gonna sell her out, are you? - Thanks for the vote of confidence. What would you do, you're so smart? - I'm sorry, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. It's just that, well, it's her home. She's happy here. - I know that, Cliff. So was I once. She'll get over it. (melancholy music) - I think we just had our first argument. - You think, don't you know? - With Alan, who can tell? (children singing) - Going to the mountain, OK? - Sure. (engine roars) (suspenseful music) - Hi, Gwilyn, looking for us? - [Gwilyn] No, I was looking for you. I thought we had a date. - I'll head back if you want. - No, it's OK. I'm sorry, I forgot. (speaking in foreign language) Gwilyn, don't be stupid. Gwilyn, let him go! (speaking in foreign language) Please, let him go, you're upsetting him. (horse neighs) Come on, come on. - Gwen! Gwen! Gwen! - Take some getting used to, his being dead. Guess I expected him to live forever. - [Sam] So did I. He couldn't bear the idea of getting old. Couldn't bear it. I used to tell him to try and take it easy. Hard work, you know, on a farm for an old fella and a strip of a girl. - [Alan] Gwen doesn't seem to think so. - [Sam] No doubt she doesn't, but it's true all the same. The farm not paying. It hasn't been for years. - It used to. - Aye, when there was no common market and the sheep made a profit, and there was you and Dai and Gwen's daughter worked the place. Horse stud's hard work, and it costs a lot to keep up good breeding. The public's fussy these days. Smarter. Wants the best (mumbles). - [Alan] What about Mabon? - Aye, he's a good'un. He and that foal of his might even save the stud if there was someone who wanted to do the work. Dai didn't call him Mabon for nothing. - 70 years and all for nothing if I make her sell. Yep, that's right, Moorland Leisure. Leisure. Right. Oh, I'd appreciate it if you could get back to me by tomorrow. Great. Thank you. (peaceful music) - Granddad kept everything you wrote. - All this effort, you better win. - We'll win. - Why did he leave? Alan. - Grandpa never said. It's something to do with the accident though. Granddad had a really bad leg and scars all down his face. - Must've been a hell of a fight to last 20 years. Wonder what it was about. - Horses. It's always horses around here. Nothing else is that important. - Ho, ho, ho, ho. (laughing) - Well, figured it's Christmas. (speaking in foreign language) Fits better every year. - All you Davies are nuts. Have you thought about what you'd do if Alan doesn't sell? I mean, really thought about it. You couldn't run this place on your own. He'd have to stay, wouldn't he? Sell up in L.A. That's what I thought. - [Mrs. Howard] Well, he seems very nice. - I suppose so, but I wish he'd get on with it. - Oh, that reminds me, Jack Turnbridge called. (Chris groans) More problems? - One of the guys on the planning committee is making up a fuss about compulsory purchase. Can you believe these guys? I grew up with them. I must have been born on a different planet. I want to make something of this place. Is that a crime? - Do we really need this farm? Can't we do without it? - No. We need this development. We need it badly. We're up to our necks. If I have to start to repay these advances, I've had it. - [Sam] They seem to be getting on all right. - [Alan] Yeah. - Gwen knows what she's doing. She's got new ideas, good ideas. Old Dai held her back a bit if you want my honest opinion. - I've been over to see Howard. - Catching the lion in his den, is it? - Yeah, something like that. It's a good offer. I don't want to take it, but I think I should. - Look, hold your horses for a bit, if you know what I mean. Give yourself a bit of time. - It's not gonna change anything, though, is it? - Nope. The race is tomorrow. It'll give you a chance to know the value of the stock. - I can do without that, too. You know what happened the last time I took a horse to a show. (mysterious music) - [Sam] That's it. Keep it straight. - Left a bit, Sam. Left. - [Sam] Right over. Right. - Steady a bit. - That's it, give it to me. Give it to me. Right up, away. That's it, steady now. Steady. (horse neighs) You only want wings now. - Oh yeah. (horse neighs) - [Alan] Whoa, whoa, steady. - [Gwen] Are you all right? - Fine. - Come on, Cliff, give us a hand. They'll still be there when we get back. - [Alan] Steady, steady. - It's only a fair, man. Nothing's going to happen. Mabon is not like Blaze. (horse neighs) Big day today, boy. (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) - Hi, Nerys. - Hi, Gwen. - [Gwen] I've lost my wings. - What? - I've lost my wings. - Is that what you're going to wear for chapel next Sunday? (laughs) Here, jump in here. I'll take you to the North Pole. - Hi, Gwen. - Hi, Gwilyn. - Look, I'm sorry about the other day. I didn't mean anything by it. It's just that... Well, ever since that yank came along-- - It doesn't matter. - Suddenly I'm not good enough, is that it? - Look, Gwilyn, they're my guests. We'll talk later, OK? - But we-- - The race starts in a minute. (horse grunts) - Come boy, come boy. (horse neighs) (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) (playful festival music) (horse neighs) (screaming loudly) - [Nerys] Alan. Alan. Come give us a hand. - Another wild one, hey, Davies? (laughing) - What's wrong with Alan today? He's in a really weird mood. - I don't know, I've never seen him like this. Maybe he's bet the farm on the race. - That's not funny, Cliff. I know the race is for fun, but Mabon's got to win. He's got to show Alan how good he is. - I know. It's just easy to forget sometimes, that's all. I guess I shouldn't have, but I've had a great time the last few days. I really have. It's not a vacation for you, though is it, or Alan? It's your life. - Come on, you too. The start is almost ready. - Get up, Mabon. Go on. - Leave 'em standing, partner. (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) - [Announcer] Late entry, Mr. Talbot's main chestnut, (mumbles) Charlie. The other competitors are as per schedule in your program. Gwen Davies riding Mabon, and I think we all wish her the best of luck. (horses neighing) - [Male Speaker] Three, two, one, go! (crowd cheers) - Come on, Mabon! Come on! Come on! Steady, Mabon! (horse grunts) Steady, Mabon! Come on, Mabon, come on! Steady, steady! Come on, Mabon. Come on! (suspenseful music) Steady, steady, Mabon! - [Male Speaker] Get up. Steady, steady. - You're too close! Get away, we're gonna wreck! (horse neighs) (speaking in foreign language) Come on, Mabon. (Gwen screams) OK, Mabon. (crowd cheers) A little more for Granddad, Mabon. A little more for Granddad. Go, go, Mabon! (crowd cheers) - Go, go, yes! Go! (crowd cheers) (peaceful music) - [Male Speaker] Well done, Gwen. (crowd applauds) (crowd cheers) - [Male Speaker] Woo! - [Announcer] Flowers and plants are all being sold up at half price at the horticulture tent. I'd advise anyone interested in getting a basket to make their way there as quickly as possible. Thank you for supporting this event. Please take care on your journey home. Thank you very much. - Good race, Gwenie. Good race. - Did you have fun? - That's an impressive horse you've got there, Gwen. Bet you'll get a lot of offers for him today. The price of your stock is rising, eh, Davies? (horse neighs) - I was just telling Mr. Davies over here now if he don't want to sell, that horse could turn the farm round. - I don't know about that. Bird in the hand. Best take the money when it's offered. Smart of you to get Gwen to drive though. Had a lot of sympathy out there today. Bucked up his price no end. You and your dad learned some tricks over the years, Davies. - Mr. Howard, my father didn't need tricks to sell his stock. - Well, I didn't mean to imply-- - Oh, come on, Mr. High and bloody Mighty. Where do you get off being so bloody self-righteous, huh? Nobody down here's forgotten that grey. You nearly killed your old man. That wasn't a trick? - Hey. - Cliff! - Watch it. - That's enough, Gwilyn! - [Male Speaker] Hey, look at that, young Gwilyn. - Well done, Gwilyn, boy. - Well done, Gwilyn. - I'm sorry this happened. I really didn't mean to imply that-- - I bet you didn't. But you were right. We do know about horses. We know how to breed them and we know how to sell. And Mabon's a winner. Maybe Gwen can even make a go of the stud. We're not selling. - You mean it? - What? You can't be serious. Don't turn your back on me. (speaking in foreign language) - [Nerys] Come on, let's go, come on. - It's your farm and my moors, and I want your stock off my moors now. - We have a contract, always have had. - That's all you have, Davies. 150 grazing days every year. You have two days to go. And if your stock so much as breathes on my moors for one single second longer, you're out. - Howard, they're down. We brought the last herd down yesterday. What's the matter, lose track? - You're making a big mistake! - You're full of surprises, Alan Davies. - [Alan] I know. Sometimes I even surprise myself. - [Nerys] You were never going to sell, were you? Not in your heart. All you wanted was an excuse. - Maybe. But he never should've insulted Dad. - He means it about the grazing rights. He's not just going to just let it drop. He knows you can't carry on without them. - The stock's in. Anyway, we've still got two days. What more do we need? - Nothing's changed. She still needs cash, and she still can't run this place on her own. - I know. - You're staying. - I'm staying. Prodigal son, as the saying goes, returns. (pleasant music) - Come on, come on. Come on, that's it. That's a good boy. Steady. Come on. That's it. Steady. - He's full of beans this morning. - He won, and he knows it. Come on. Come on, that way. That's a good boy. Come on. - Easy boy, steady. Can I try? (horse grunts) Oh, this brings back memories. Your dad was great with the horses, did you know? He loved the old place. Never entered his mind that he'd ever do anything else but raise horses, just like you. - What happened? What really happened? You hated being at that show yesterday. - Didn't Dai ever tell you? - No, but I'd like to know, please. - I was young, stupid. Dad and Will were always together. You know, the horses, the farm. I guess I felt left out. So I thought I'd show them. - Blaze. - I put everything I had into that horse. He was gonna be a winner, and I really didn't care what I had to do to do it. And just in case, I used every trick in the book. Dark stables, high protein diet, horseshoes. And the horse went nuts like dad said he would. I thought I could control him, but I couldn't. When we brought him out to show him, I couldn't hold him. The horse reared, broke through. I was knocked aside. There were people everywhere panicking. And when Dai tried to catch him, he caught Dai in the head. And then Blaze was all over him. Dai was a mess. We thought he'd killed him. We had to put the horse down. And Will was right. It was all my fault. The horse, Dai's leg. I left next day. I never even stopped to say goodbye to Dad, and Will never said another word to me. Ever. I haven't been to a show since. Not until yesterday. (somber music) - Staying away hurt Granddad more than the horse ever did, you know? - I know. (horse grunts) (somber music) Take care of Dad, Will. (phone rings) Yes. This is Alan Davies. Mr. Franks. Did you find what I wanted? Oh, that's great. Yeah, I really appreciate it. Yes, yes, I'll send you a copy. Soon as it's published. Good, thank you. (whistling lightly) - What's the matter? What's the matter? - Nothing. - Well, something's the matter. You've been moping around all morning. Come on, he's not going to sell. Aren't you pleased? Don't you want to stay? - It would be stupid, how can I? It's OK for Alan, he can do his job anywhere. But L.A. is my home. All my friends are there, school, everything. Sure would be nice to be asked though. - Cliff. - Hey, it's no big deal. He's not my dad. (sheep bleating) (bells ringing) (gentle organ music) - I thought you'd be here. About yesterday, things got a bit out of hand. I'm very sorry about that. As for the price. I go up another 10 grand and that'll be it. - It isn't the price. - [Chris] Look, if you don't sell, this valley's gonna lose a lot of jobs. - Is it now? Just how many jobs? - [Chris] I don't know exactly. - What about the environment? - It will not affect the environment. How many times have I got to tell people that it will not affect the environment? It's a matter of redeveloping existing facilities. The improvements of access, roads, parking. - And the planning committee has approved it. - What exactly is your point? - The point is I don't like private deals with public money. - What deals? - With the committee. I did some checking. The council to provide two thirds of the cost of improving access by compulsory purchase if necessary, as long as it doesn't cost too much. Isn't that what your buddies at Moorland Leisure did at Glanmoor last year? - We need improvements in access. Always have done. - That's very convenient then, isn't it? - What? - Look, Howard, I don't care what you do with your land. I haven't lived here for 20 years. But the people are entitled to the facts, all of them. If you can go ahead without Ty'n Rhos, great. But we're not selling. Good night, Councillor. Enjoy the carols. ("O Come All Ye Faithful") - Come on, lady, come on. Let's be having you or we'll be late. (coughs) ("Hark! The Herald Angels Sing") - Over paid, over sexed, over here. That's what they said about the yanks during the war. Things haven't changed much, Gwilyn. They'll do with a lesson or two in manners, don't you think? Be a shame if those horses got out. Still. ("Hark! The Herald Angels Sing") (Cliff laughs) (suspenseful music) (horse grunts) - Go on, let's go! (horse neighs) (horse neighs) Come on, get up, come on! Come on, Mabon. Come on, Mabon, come on! Come on. Come on, get up. Come on! Come on, won't you come? Come on, come on, get up! Come on! (horse neighs) Come on! Come on, go, move it! Come on, go on! Go, go! (horse neighs) Come on then. Move it! Come on! Go! Move! Come on, move it! Come on, come on, come on! Come on, move it! (horse neighs) - What the... Hey, hey! Hey! (speaking in foreign language) (bells ringing) (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) - Merry Christmas, Cliff. - Merry Christmas. (horse neighs) (horse neighs) (horse neighs) ♫ Santa came to say ♫ Rudolph with your nose so bright ♫ Won't you guide my sleigh tonight ♫ Ho, ho, ho ♫ Loved him ♫ As they shouted out with glee - [Alan] Oh no. (suspenseful music) - I'll call the fire brigade. - Sam! (horse neighs) - I'm all right. I'm all right. The horses! Stop them! Stop them! - Gwen, go ahead. Go on. - Someone let the horses go. - [Nerys] The fire brigade's on the way. Come on, Sam, let's get you inside. - Where's the foal? (horse neighs) - [Alan] Cliff, no! - [Gwen] Cliff! - Stay here, stay here! Cliff! Cliff, get out of there. - Where are you? - Get out of there! (horse neighs) Come on! Are you OK? - Yeah. (horse neighs) Thank God he's all right. (suspenseful music) - So you just give up? - Uncle Alan, what's the point? It'll be days before we find all the horses again. And in case you've forgotten, it's Christmas day. We've only got today's grazing rights left. Let's face it, Howard's won. - It's up to you, Gwen. Farm is yours. Just remember, Dai was a lot of things. But he wasn't a quitter. - [Cliff] What are you waiting for? Let's go. (tranquil music) - [Alan] We'll look down by the lake. - OK, I'll head up top then. - Keep your eye on the weather. - [Gwen] We'll be OK. It's going to get pretty treacherous up here. Here comes the snow. - [Cliff] It's almost noon, Gwen. - [Gwen] We'll find them, I know we will. They'll look for shelter, warmth. - [Cliff] I know how they feel, I'm freezing. Gwen, look over there. - Bonnie. Cliff, it's Bonnie! Come on! - [Nerys] You can't just let him get away with it. Someone could've been killed. - [Alan] We're not even sure it was Howard. - [Nerys] Of course we are. You're just gonna let the matter drop? - [Alan] Yes, leave it to the police. - [Nerys] Then he'll get away with it. - [Alan] Probably. (suspenseful music) - [Nerys] I hope Gwen found them, Alan. It's getting dangerous out here. (suspenseful music) - [Gwen] It'll be dark soon. We'd better get moving. They must be in the quarry. There's shelter there. - [Cliff] They'd better be, we're running out of time. - Here, carry this for a bit. Cliff, are you OK? That was so stupid. I'm sorry, Cliff. Come on, we'd better get you back. Can you still ride? - My knee. Look, stop fussing. I can find my own way back. It's Christmas day, Gwen. It you don't find them now, you've had it. You lose everything. I can take care of myself. Honest. Look, just promise me you'll get back before dark. The quarry, and then home, OK? Promise? Ow. You're the only sister I've got. (suspenseful music) Have you seen Gwen? - Cliff, what happened to you? - Isn't she with you? - [Alan] You left her on her own. Of all the stupid, irresponsible-- - Yeah, but what else was I supposed to do? - Alan, please calm down. She'll be fine. - How's your knee, Cliff? That's a nasty cut you've got there, Cliff. Where are you gonna live, Cliff? How are you gonna manage? Suddenly, I don't matter anymore, is that it? - You really believe that? You really believe that? - Just tell me. - You're wrong, Cliff. You're so wrong. You really think I don't care what happens to you? You're my son. All the son I've ever wanted, here or in L.A. I assumed you understand that. I shouldn't have. I'm sorry. - There's a home for you here, Cliff, whenever you need it. - You're not getting rid of me that easily. I still need a home base in L.A. near the holidays. After you finish college, then we'll decide, OK? - I'll have to put Bonnie and the foal in Mabon's stable. (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) - Well, it's too late to go around. Come on, boy. Come on. Straight down. Steady, easy, Mabon. Steady, Mabon. (horse neighs) - [News Reporter] The worst snowfall for years has created a picturesque white Christmas. But with blizzards moving in from the West throughout the night, particularly over higher ground, police and rescue services are warning people to stay at home. Conditions are expected to worsen over the next 24 hours. - [Alan] That's it, I'm going after her. - Hold on, hold on. She's been out in worse than this. She knows what to do. You'll only get yourself in trouble. Maybe get hurt. Nerys, make a cup of tea. Mabon won't let anything happen to her. - Mabon! (Gwen screams) Mabon! Pull, Mabon! Pull! Mabon! Pull, Mabon! Pull! Harder, harder! Pull harder! Mabon! Harder, boy! Good boy, Mabon. Good boy. - Visitor. - Gwen, she isn't still up there? Don't you think you should call the rescue services or something? - We're giving it an hour. - If anything happens to her-- - Cool it, Cliff. What do you want, Howard? - I just wanted you to know I didn't want this to happen. (sleigh bells ringing) Do you know who started the fire, Sam? - No. - I think you better leave. - Very well. But this was your last chance to sell. (suspenseful music) Business is business, Davies. My offer still stands. Take it while you can. If you make me wait till tomorrow, you get nothing. - Howard. - [Cliff] Alan, you can't sell. - This is still my land, Councillor. Merry Christmas. I'm gonna miss this place. Crazy, isn't it? - Me too. (horse neighs) (vibrant music) - Alan. (horse neighs) - Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo, woo, woo, woo! Yes! Go, woo, woo, woo! Yeah! (Gwen cheers) Wahoo! - Gwen, you did it! (Sam laughs) - Merry Christmas! (laughing) (tranquil music) (MultiCom Jingle)
