HE COMES UP TO THE FARMER, HE'S GOING DOWN THIS ROAD ON A MOTORCYCLE-- VROOM, VROOM, VROOM! ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE CAN SEE A BIG PUDDLE OF WATER IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DIRT ROAD, SO HE ASKS THE FARMER, HE GETS OFF THE BIKE, HE SAYS, "HEY, MR. FARMER, HOW DEEP IS THIS PUDDLE?"

WELL, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING: THAT CHILD'S GONNA GROW UP DEAF. - WHAT'S THE MATTER? - NOTHING, NOTHING. THE BALLOONS DIDN'T WORK TODAY. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA FIND-- DR. ABRAHMS SAID YOU WERE WONDERFUL. WHEN DID YOU TALK TO THE DOC? WELL, HE CALLED TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE AN 11:00 APPOINTMENT TOMORROW MORNING. WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT? NOTHING. YOU KNOW THOSE DOCTORS-- THEY TRY TO DRUM UP NEW TRADE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME. LISTEN... YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED? THE FACT THAT IN THE END OF THE ACT INSTEAD OF USING YOUR BASIC-- - YEAH. - BASIC RABBIT, I'M GONNA USE A CHICKEN. - WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? - I THINK YOU OUGHTA GO IN-- - WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR DINNER? - WANT SOME SEAFOOD, MAMA? YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ANDREWS SISTERS. YEAH, IF I COULD SING AND I WASN'T AN ONLY CHILD. OH, THE LENGTHS YOU WILL GO TO NOT TO WATCH MY ACT. YES. ( laughs ) ( chuckles ) ♪ FOODLEY-YAKI-SAKI, WANT SOME SEAFOOD, MAMA? ♪ HEY, LOOK, SON, I KNOW THAT YOUR DAD SAID HE WAS COMING BACK TO GET YOU-- AND HE IS. HE IS, HE'S GONNA COME BACK, BUT IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK NOW-- OVER A WEEK, ZOOKY. AND I HAVE A FEELING HE'S NOT GONNA COME BACK TODAY. HUH? WHY DON'T YOU COME IN AND HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT? IF YOU DON'T COME IN, SHE'S GONNA BE AWFULLY DISAPPOINTED. HEY, IF YOU COME ON IN AND EAT, I PROMISE I WON'T TELL ANY JOKES, HUH? YOU'RE GONNA MISS SOME GOOD FOOD. NOTHING UP MY SLEEVE, OKAY? NOW I HAVE A LITTLE COMPARTMENT IN THE HAT FOR A CHICKEN. - A LIVE CHICKEN? - NO, FRIED CHICKEN. - ( giggling ) - OF COURSE, A LIVE CHICKEN. PUT IT ON THE HEAD, OFF WITH THE HAT, THE CHICKEN'S THERE, LAYS AN EGG ON MY HEAD. WHAT DO YOU THINK? - WHAT IS THAT? - NEEDS WORK, JACK. WELL, EVERYTHING NEEDS WORK. IT'S JUST AN IDEA, BUT OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT, HUH? HAS POTENTIAL. YEAH, IT HAS POTENTIAL. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FUNNY, JACK. DON'T STRAIN YOURSELF LAUGHING. NEXT TIME I GET SOME CHILDREN, I'M GONNA HOLD AN AUDITION-- FOR LAUGHERS ONLY. - WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CHICKEN FLIES AWAY? - HE'S NOT GONNA FLY ANYWHERE. I'M GONNA PUT A LEAD IN HIS SOCKS RIGHT HERE, SO HE'LL STAY. WHAT IF THE CHICKEN GETS NERVOUS AND DO-DOS RIGHT IN YOUR HAIR? YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY? ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRAIN THE CHICKEN TO DO-DO IN MY HAIR. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T PLEASE THE KIDS TODAY. YOU JUST CAN'T DO IT. THEY'VE SEEN IT ALL. TELEVISION, HONEY, TELEVISION-- THAT'S WHAT'S RUINED IT ALL. SURE, BIG BIRD-- HE STOLE ALL MY STUFF. I WAS DOING A BIRTHDAY PARTY THE OTHER DAY, I WAS DOING MY, YOU KNOW, THE THING WHERE I DISAPPEAR. A LITTLE KID SAYS TO ME, "OH, I KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT-- SPECIAL EFFECTS." WELL, ALL I CAN SAY IS... THANK GOODNESS SOMEBODY HASN'T LOST HER SENSE OF HUMOR. OH, LISTEN, JACK, I THINK YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE SUCH SMART KIDS. - I AM? - YEAH. IT MAKES YOU WORK A LITTLE HARDER AND KEEPS YOU ON YOUR TOES. YEAH. I WAS THINKING, MAYBE THE REASON THAT THE CHILDREN DON'T LAUGH ANYMORE-- MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, I'M NOT FUNNY ANYMORE. HMM? EVER THINK OF THAT? WELL... YOU ARE. YOU'RE THE FUNNIEST MAN I EVER MET. - I AM? - YEAH. THERE'S ONE THING I DO KNOW, HONEY. WHAT? I HAVE NEVER MET A LAD WHO DOESN'T ENJOY ONE OF MY PEANUT BUTTER BONANZAS. TELEGRAM FOR MR. ZOOKY. HEY. TELEGRAM. TELEGRAM FOR MR. ZOOK-- ( coughs ) GLAD YOU TRAVEL LIGHT. ( horn honks ) WELL, IF IT ISN'T FLAPPO THE CLOWN. WELL, IF IT ISN'T FLAPPO THE MOUTH. OH, FUNNY, VERY FUNNY. NO WONDER YOU DON'T TALK IN YOUR ACT. NO COFFEE. JUST ORANGE JUICE STRAIGHT. YOUR STOMACH HURTING YOU AGAIN? NO, MY STOMACH AIN'T HURTING ME. WHY IS IT ALL BARTENDERS THINK THAT PEOPLE WANT TO CONFIDE IN THEM? BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES. WHAT'S IN THE BOX? I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT'S IN THE BOX. IT'S GABBY. SAY HELLO TO JEETER. JEETER, SAY HELLO TO GABBY. YOU KNOW THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT DON'T ALLOW NO PETS IN HERE. IT'S MY SEEING-EYE DOG. JACK, IT AIN'T SANITARY. RELAX, WILL YOU, GAB? I GOTTA TEACH HIM A COUPLE OF TRICKS BEFORE I DO A BIRTHDAY PARTY THIS AFTERNOON. YOU'RE STILL DOING THOSE BIRTHDAY PARTIES FOR PEANUTS? IF IT'S ANY NEWS TO YOU, I MADE 50 BUCKS LAST WEEK DOING ONE OF THOSE BIRTHDAY PARTIES. OH, YOU MADE 50 BUCKS? WELL, THAT'S JUST GREAT. HOW ABOUT THE EXPENSES, HUH? GASOLINE, BALLOONS, PRIZES, YOUR MAKEUP, FOOD FOR THE CHICKEN? YOU'RE A GOOD CLOWN, BUT YOU KNOW WHY YOU NEVER MADE IT? I DON'T WANNA KNOW FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME WHY I DIDN'T MAKE IT. SMILEY HAD SMARTS AND TALENT. HE MADE IT BIG WITH BARNUM &amp; BAILEY. I DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TALENT. YOU-- I NEVER SAW ANYBODY WITH TALENT LIKE YOU HAD. AND YOU KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT? Both: TOO SOFT. RIGHT. JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE AN ORPHAN, THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO TAKE EVERY STREET KID IN CHICAGO IN. THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. AT LEAST YOU COULD TAKE A LITTLE MONEY IN HELP FROM THE STATE. ALL THAT AGGRAVATION. ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS SIGN A FEW FORMS, YOU GET A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS MAYBE FROM THE GOVERNMENT. LOOK, I'VE TOLD YOU A THOUSAND TIMES: I DON'T RAISE KIDS FOR PROFIT. WHO'S TALKING ABOUT PROFIT? I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF HELP, MAYBE BREAKING EVEN. JACK, YOU AND SHIRLEE HAVE BEEN MARRIED, LET ME SEE NOW, 33 YEARS. 34. 34 YEARS. UH-HUH. HOW MANY KIDS HAVE YOU TAKEN IN IN THAT TIME? 37, NOT COUNTING OUR NATURAL DAUGHTER. 37 KIDS YOU TOOK IN. - ( phone ringing ) - ( coughs ) YOU GET MY POINT? HELLO. OH, HELLO, BABY. SURE, BABY. LOVE YOU, BABY. ( wheezing cough ) ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS YOUR WIFE. SHE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU NOT TO FORGET YOUR APPOINTMENT AT 11:00. GETTING SO A GUY CAN'T EVEN DRINK HIS BREAKFAST. JACK, IT AIN'T GOOD TO BREAK AN APPOINTMENT. JEETER, THIS IS ONE APPOINTMENT THAT I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO KEEP FOR 20 YEARS. SAVE ME SOME PASTRAMI. - WHAT ABOUT THE CHICKEN? - HE LIKES POPCORN. ( phones ringing ) JACK. I THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME. I'M GONNA CUT OUT SMOKING. ( chuckles ) THAT'S GREAT, JACK. YOU DON'T NEED ANY MORE BLOOD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR ANY MORE TESTS, DO YOU? NO, I THINK THIS SHOULD DO IT FOR ONE DAY. THAT'S GREAT, 'CAUSE I'M RUNNING SHORT. HEY, THAT BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER OF YOURS, LAURIE-- SHE'S GOT A BIRTHDAY THE 16th OF THIS MONTH, A WEEK FROM SATURDAY, HUH? - YOU'RE INCREDIBLE. - I'M IN A BIRTHDAY BUSINESS. HEY, WHAT ABOUT IF I DROP BY, AND I DO A LITTLE SOMETHING TO SURPRISE HER? YOU KNOW, SHE'S PRETTY GROWN-UP NOW, JACK. - OH, SURE. - YOU WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE HER. WELL, SHE'S PROBABLY GONNA HAVE A PARTY. I COULD DROP BY AND DO A LITTLE SOMETHING. JACK, SHE'S HAVING A ROLLER DISCO PARTY. - OH. - ( chuckling ) DISCO. THAT'S GOOD. UH... I SHOULD HAVE THE RESULTS OF THESE TESTS LATER THIS AFTERNOON, JACK. ARTHUR, I'VE BEEN A PERFORMER FOR... FOR 40 YEARS... AND I'VE DEVELOPED A, UH... AN EXTRA SENSE. THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK, IT STICKS OUT BEFORE THE CURTAIN GOES UP. I CAN ALMOST TELL WHETHER AN AUDIENCE IS GONNA FALL IN LOVE WITH ME OR I'M GONNA GO OUT THERE AND DIE. IT'S NEVER FAILED ME. I WISH TO GOD I'D NEVER... DEVELOPED THAT KNACK. I'LL CALL YOU ABOUT 6:00, JACK. YEAH, THANKS, ARTHUR. YOU GIVE ME-- GIVE ME A CALL. HEY, THAT LAURIE-- LAURIE OF YOURS, SHE WAS-- OOH! SHE WAS A GREAT LAUGHER. ( chuckles ) HEY. HEY, ZOOKY. ( chuckles ) JUST THE MAN I WANTED TO SEE. I'M GONNA DO A NEW ROUTINE, AND I NEED A PROFESSIONAL OPINION. YOU KNOW, I'M-- MY GRANDDAUGHTER, SHERRY, SHE USED TO GO ALONG WITH ME TO HELP ME ON THINGS LIKE THIS, BUT SINCE SHE MOVED TO DENVER, WHY, NOBODY GOES ALONG WITH ME ANYMORE. HEY, THERE'S GONNA BE ICE CREAM AND CAKE AND BALLOONS. YOU DON'T WANT TO? TO TELL THE TRUTH, I DON'T WANT TO GO, EITHER. IN FACT, I DON'T FEEL VERY FUNNY TODAY AT ALL. BUT A JOB IS A JOB, AND I HATE LETTING PEOPLE DOWN. AND I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE... I COULD USE THE COMPANY. WHAT DO YOU SAY? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA LIKE BEING ON THE ROAD, SON. WORKING A PICNIC IS NOT LIKE BEING ON A STAGE WITH AN AUDIENCE. NO, THE AUDIENCE IS ALL AROUND YOU. SO YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL WITH MAGIC, AND YOU GOTTA WORK FAST BECAUSE THE SUN IS BEATING DOWN ON YOUR MAKEUP, AND YOU'RE IN A TREMENDOUS SWEAT, AND YOU JUST HAVE TO-- YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY STRAIN YOURSELF. ( children clamoring ) YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN DOING MY FACE EXACTLY THE SAME WAY SINCE I WAS 16. A CLOWN'S FACE IS HIS TRADEMARK. YOU COULD SUE SOMEBODY FOR... FOR COPYING A FACE. YOU KNOW, THE REAL AUTHENTIC CLOWNS, THE REAL ONES, THEY NEVER TALK AFTER THEY'RE IN FULL MAKEUP. THE TV CLOWNS THAT DO THE KIDDIE SHOWS, YOU KNOW, COMMERCIALS-- THEY'RE NOT THE REAL SERIOUS CLOWNS. THE REALLY GREAT ONES LIKE LOU JACOBS, EMMETT KELLY-- THEY ARE THE JEWELS, CROWN JEWELS. NOW THIS IS IT. ONCE I PUT THIS ON, I'M AS BRILLIANT AS PIERROT, AS EXPRESSIVE AS MARCEAU, AND AS SILENT AS THE GREAT ZOOKY. ( inaudible ) ( whimsical music playing ) Children: THERE'S A CHICKEN ON YOUR HEAD! THERE'S A CHICKEN ON YOUR HEAD! ( clucking ) ( applauding, cheering ) SO HOW DID YOU LIKE THE SHOW, ZACHARIAH? THAT GREAT, HUH? YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANNA TAKE THIS NO-TALKING THING PERSONALLY, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU CAN TALK. I HEARD YOU TALK TO YOUR FATHER BEFORE HE LEFT. YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD SINCE. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU LIVE IN AMERICA. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LAW THAT PROTECTS YOU. IT'S TRUE. I SAW IT ON TV. "YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT." DID YOU HEAR THE ONE ABOUT ROY ROGERS? HE HAD THIS BIG PLACE UP IN THE MOUNTAINS, SEE, AND THIS BIG MOUNTAIN LION... ...SO DAY 11, STICKS HER HEAD OUT THE WINDOW AND SHE YELLS AT ROY ROGERS... ♪ PARDON ME, ROY ♪ ♪ IS THAT THE CAT THAT CHEWED YOUR NEW SHOES? ♪ YOU KNOW, ONE DAY YOU'RE GONNA LAUGH, AND IT'S GONNA SHOCK ME. IT'S JUST GONNA SHOCK-- HEY, SHIRL! SHIRLEE! I GUESS WE BEAT 'EM HOME. I GOT ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU. LOOK, SIT DOWN, LISTEN TO THIS. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES-- HE HAS A HEART ATTACK WHILE HE'S IN OFFICE. YOU UNDERSTAND? AND THEY ADVERTISE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FOR A DONOR SO HE CAN HAVE A TRANSPLANT FOR HIS HEART.

AND THEY WANTED-- I FORGET THE REST OF THE STORY. HELLO, MR. CARNAHAN? MR. CARNAHAN, THIS IS JACK THUM. YEAH, I'VE DONE QUITE A BIT OF WORK DOWN AROUND THAT SCHOOL EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. I WAS CALLING TO SEE THAT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOME THINGS THAT COULD BE COMING UP THERE, YOU KNOW, WITH PARTIES OR BIRTHDAYS OR MAYBE A CELEBRATION OF SOME KIND THAT I-- YES, I UNDERSTAND. ( hangs up ) ( picks up phone, dialing ) ( shouting ) NO, I WON'T LEAVE ANY NUMBER OF MINE ON ANY MACHINE! LISTEN, MACHINE, YOU'RE TALKING TO A REAL, LIVE PERSON AND I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE MY NUMBER ON ANY DAMN MACHINE! ( slams receiver ) - JACK, WHAT'S THE MATTER? - NOTHING! IT'S NOTHING AT ALL. STOP THAT-- LISTEN, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU KNOW THE-- LISTEN, YOU KNOW THE RULES. IF YOU CAN'T LIVE BY THE RULES, THEN GET OUT! - JACK. - I'M SICK AND TIRED OF IT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I'M SICK AND TIRED OF TRYING TO CALL AND GET WORK SO I CAN PAY THE RENT IN THIS ROTTEN APARTMENT? I'M SORRY. HONEY, I'M SORRY. I'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. - ( people laughing ) - ( upbeat music playing ) - HI, JACK. - HI, GINA. GIVE ME A SEVEN AND SEVEN. ALL RIGHT. SEVEN AND SEVEN FOR JACK. - JACK'S HERE? - YEAH, OVER THERE.

YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF ULCERS. - ARE YOU SURE? - I'M SURE. I'M POSITIVE. - OKAY, OKAY. - LEAVE ME ALONE. HEY, DID YOU SEE THE NEW POSTER WITH SMILEY'S PICTURE? HOW COULD I MISS IT? I THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE IT OUTSIDE IN NEON WITH SEARCHLIGHTS GOING AROUND IN THE AIR. WOW-WOW-WOW. DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN WE PICKED HIM OUT OF THE GUTTER THE NIGHT BEFORE HE GOT MARRIED? HE NEVER WOULD HAVE REACHED 30 IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU AND ME. TELL IT TO BARNUM &amp; BAILEY. ( sighs ) WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT YOU AND ME WENT ON A BENDER? YOU MEAN, REAL DRUNK? I MEAN, WE GOT NAILED DOWN, SMASHED. - OH, YOU MEAN REALLY DRUNK. - WRECKED. WRECKED. NEW YEAR'S EVE, EH? 1968. I'D SAY WE'RE A LITTLE OVERDUE, EH? WHAT ARE WE DRINKING TO? SMILEY? NO, WE'RE GONNA DRINK TO US-- TO FLAPPO AND FLAPPO THE CLOWN. YOU KNOW, I SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO YOU. - YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING. - ABOUT WHAT? FLAPPO THE CLOWN. I'M A FLOP AT MOST EVERYTHING I'VE DONE.

I CAN'T TELL YOU AT HOME, EITHER. JACK, PLEASE TELL ME. I CAN TAKE IT. I JUST CAN'T STAND NOT KNOWING. IT'S NOT YOU. HONEY, IT AIN'T YOU. I LOVE YOU. I CAN'T SAY IT BECAUSE I'M AFRAID...

YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING SINCE LAST NIGHT, IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT JACK SUPPORTS ALL OF US. SO I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS JOB AT A GARAGE, AND I CAN MAKE, LIKE, 100 BUCKS A WEEK-- IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND WATCHING ANGIE WHILE I WAS GONE. NO, I WOULDN'T MIND WATCHING THE BABY. - THANK YOU. - HEY... IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU AND JACK LETTING US LIVE HERE, I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THE BABY. - DID NOT. - YOU DID, TOO. - DID NOT. - BE QUIET. ANGIE'S SLEEPING. WAIT, PUT THAT BACK. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. YOU KNOW THAT JACK AND I LOVE ALL OF YOU AS IF YOU WERE BORN TO US. WE'RE A FAMILY, AND PROBABLY A LOT CLOSER THAN A LOT OF FAMILIES BECAUSE WE REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE NOT TO HAVE EACH OTHER, RIGHT? WELL, YESTERDAY WE FOUND OUT THAT JACK IS SICK. NOW, IT'S NOTHING TO GET WORRIED ABOUT, BUT, UH, HE HAS TO GO INTO THE HOSPITAL SOON FOR AN OPERATION. - IS HE GONNA DIE? - OF COURSE NOT. DON'T BE STUPID. WELL, HONEY, NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING FOR CERTAIN IN THIS LIFE UNTIL AFTER IT'S OVER, BUT I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES. I THINK HE'S GONNA BE OKAY. - SO DO I. - ME, TOO. - MOM. - YEAH? IF-- IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO JACK, WILL WE STILL LIVE HERE? OH, OF COURSE, SWEETHEART. THIS IS YOUR HOME NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. - Alice: BYE, MOM. - BYE, HONEY. - SEE YOU LATER, MOM. - OKAY, RALPHIE. - Tommy: I'LL BE HOME AT NOON TO FEED ANGIE. - ALL RIGHT.

I-- I-- I TALKED TO THE DOCTOR THIS MORNING, AND HE SAID THAT YOU'LL BE GOING INTO THE HOSPITAL ON MONDAY, AND TUESDAY YOU'LL HAVE THE OPERATION. A GUY GETS A SPOT ON HIS X-RAY, AND HE GETS HIS VOTE CANCELED. IT CAN'T WAIT, JACK. YOU CAN'T LET THIS THING HANG OVER YOUR HEAD. HONEY, LOOK, I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK COMING UP THIS WEEK. I GOT PARTY AFTER PARTY. IT'S A $300 WEEK. WELL, I'LL TELL THEM. I'LL CALL EVERYBODY. I'LL LET THEM KNOW. HONEY, HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT AS TO WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR THIS BIG OPERATION?

( laughs ) AND TONIGHT-- WELL, TONIGHT... I'M JUST AN OLD MAN LIVING IN A TRAILER. TOO LATE FOR REGRETS. OH, YOU BET.

WHILE I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO WORK FOR THESE FEW MONTHS, I WANT TO SEE TO IT THAT THEY GET SOMETHING TO TIE THEM OVER. YOU SEE, YOU HAVE MINIMUM COVERAGE FOR A SELF-EMPLOYED BUSINESSMAN. BUT IT SAYS THAT IT'S WORTH $50,000. OH, AND IT IS, BUT ONLY IN THE CASE OF ACCIDENTAL DEATH. WAIT A MINUTE, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU MEAN, IF I LIE IN A HOSPITAL FOR SIX MONTHS, AND I'M SUFFERING, I DON'T GET NOTHING. BUT IF I WERE TO WALK OUT OF YOUR OFFICE, AND I GET HIT BY A TRUCK, THEN I'M WORTH $50,000? BASICALLY, YES. THAT'S THE KIND OF POLICY YOU CHOSE. Woman: MR. THUM, MR. GREEN WILL BE YOUR ROOMMATE. WHAT'S HIS FIRST NAME? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. ROLAND. HI, ROLAND. I'M JACK THUM.

HONEY, THESE DAMN HOSPITALS-- THEY PUT YOU BETWEEN THE STARCHED SHEETS AND YOU START TO FEEL SICK ALREADY. Shirlee: I KNOW. IS THAT ALL RIGHT? Okay, Peter, just avoid that dragon over there... YOU KNOW, MY BEST AUDIENCE IS DOWN ON THE FOURTH FLOOR, AND I'D FEEL MUCH BETTER GOING DOWN THERE, MAYBE DOING A MATINEE. YEAH, AND YOU THINK YOU COULD GET BY THAT WARDEN? MAYBE IF WE BRIBED A COUPLE OF GUARDS. - ( both chuckle ) - ( coughs ) - YEAH. - EXCUSE ME. YOU THINK YOU'RE UP TO IT? WELL, I COULD... SURE DO WITH HEARING SOME LAUGHTER.

THE MEMORIAL ORTHOPEDIC WING IS PROUD TO PRESENT YOUR VERY OWN... JACK THUM! ( whimsical music playing ) PFFT. PFFT. PFFT. - YOU TIRED? - JUST A LITTLE. YOU GET SOME REST. WHEN I'M FINISHED HERE, I'M GONNA GO HOME AND FEED THE KIDS. YEAH, SAY-- SAY HELLO TO MR. TALKATIVE. YOU WORKED A MIRACLE WITH ZOOKY, JACK. SINCE HE'S BEEN TO THE CIRCUS, HE'S A DIFFERENT KID. HE EVEN LET ME PUT THE SUITCASE UP IN THE CLOSET. YOU SHOULD HAVE BURNED IT. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D ENJOY THE SMELL OF COLD CREAM ON A MAN. YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA TAKE THIS MODEL TO JACK IN THE HOSPITAL. - YOU CAN'T. - WHY NOT? IT'S MY MODEL. 'CAUSE THEY DON'T ALLOW KIDS VISITING IN THE HOSPITAL. OH, RIGHT. UM, WELL, I'LL HAVE SHIRLEE TAKE TO TO HIM, THEN, AND I'LL WRITE HIM A NOTE. RALPH, DO YOU THINK JACK'S EVER COMING OUT OF THE HOSPITAL? OF COURSE. YOU HEARD WHAT SHIRLEE SAID. I KNOW, BUT MY MAMA WENT IN THE HOSPITAL FOR AN OPERATION, AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK. ( people screaming on TV ) WELL, JACK'S DIFFERENT. HE'S A CLOWN. IT'S DIFFERENT WITH CLOWNS. ( gunfire on TV ) OH, NO. ZOOKY, JACK HASN'T LEFT YOU. HE'S COMING BACK. HE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. I THOUGHT YOU UNDERSTOOD. JACK HAS NOT LEFT YOU. OKAY, COME ON. YOU'RE GONNA SEE FOR YOURSELF. ( whispering ) STAY CLOSE TO ME. OKAY? TV host: Scrambled names of very famous people, okay? Shirlee: JACK. HI, HONEY. COME ON IN. JUST IN TIME TO SEE ME LOSE A STARING MATCH WITH THE LOVELY POTATOES. UH, JACK, ZOOKY WAS AFRAID YOU WEREN'T COMING BACK, SO I BROUGHT HIM ALONG, 'CAUSE I THOUGHT THE TWO OF YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A TALK. WELL, SHIRLEE, LOOK, IF YOU-- IF YOU TAKE THIS AWAY, PLEASE, THEN WE'LL STRAIGHTEN EVERYTHING OUT, HUH? - ALL RIGHT. - THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ROLAND, WILL YOU EXCUSE US FOR A FEW MINUTES? HMM. NOW, ZOOKY... I'M VERY GLAD THAT YOU CAME. I KNOW THAT YOU'VE HAD A TOUGH TIME. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS GONNA UPSET YOU SO MUCH... IF I CAME TO THE HOSPITAL. IF YOU THINK I'D RATHER BE HERE INSTEAD OF BEING WITH YOU, WHY, YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER THINK COMING. BUT I HAD TO DO IT. AND I'LL BE HOME... IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND THEN WE'LL-- EVERYTHING WILL BE THE SAME, SEE, AND YOU CAN HELP ME WITH-- AHEM-- WITH THE BIRTHDAY PARTIES AGAIN, JUST LIKE YOU DID. LOOK, I'M-- I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING. IT'LL BE A SECRET, HUH? I HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD SHIRLEE THIS. THIS OPERATION I'M GONNA HAVE... MAY NOT DO ANY GOOD. AND I MAY NOT BE WITH YOU LIKE I WOULD WANT TO BE. I... YOU KNOW... WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CHILDREN... AT OUR HOUSE. THEY'RE ALL WONDERFUL CHILDREN, BUT FUNNY THING IS, I FEEL CLOSER TO YOU THAN I DID TO ANY OF THEM. AND THEY WERE ALL GOOD KIDS. I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE MY-- MY SON. AT THE CIRCUS, I WAS SO PROUD. I WANTED TO YELL OUT, TELL EVERYBODY, I'D SAY, "HEY, HEY, LOOK OVER HERE. THIS IS ZOOKY." "HE'S MY SON." SO JUST REMEMBER, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS... I LOVE YOU. ZOOKY. ZOOKY! ZOOKY, WHAT IS IT, HONEY? ROLAND? HMM. LISTEN, I GOT-- I GOT ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU. UH... THERE'S THIS GUY WHO LOSES EVERYTHING HE'S GOT IN LIFE, SO HE GOES UP ON THE BRIDGE... ( coughs ) TO JUMP OFF TO KILL HIMSELF. AND HE'S JUST ABOUT TO DO IT, AND AN OLD HAG APPEARS. I MEAN, A REAL OLD HAG. AND SHE SAYS, "SONNY, DON'T DO THAT. I'LL GIVE YOU THREE WISHES IF YOU DON'T DO IT." AND HE SAYS, "THAT'S PRETTY GOOD." SO HE SAYS, "MY FIRST WISH IS THAT I COULD GET ALL THE MONEY THAT I'VE LOST IN LIFE BACK." SHE SAYS, "YOUR WISH IS GRANTED. "YOU CALL THE BANK, AND YOU'LL FIND THAT IT'S BEEN REDEPOSITED FOR YOU." WELL... HE STARTS TO FEEL BETTER, SHE SAYS, "SECOND WISH?" HE SAYS, "WELL, I'D LIKE TO HAVE MY WIFE AND MY FAMILY BACK." SHE SAYS, "GO HOME. "GO ON HOME. YOUR WIFE WILL MEET YOU, AND YOUR CHILDREN WILL MEET YOU." AND SO HE'S FEELING BETTER ALL THE TIME-- BETTER AND BETTER. SHE SAYS, "THE THIRD WISH?" HE SAYS, "THE THIRD WISH-- I'D LIKE TO GET MY OLD JOB BACK." SHE SAYS, "WELL, THE MINUTE THAT YOU GET HOME, THE PHONE'S GONNA RING, AND THEY'RE GONNA BEG YOU TO COME BACK." HE SAYS TO HER, "WELL, YOU'VE DONE SUCH A WONDERFUL THING FOR ME. IF THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN DO FOR YOU-- IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU?" SHE SAYS, "SONNY, "I'VE BEEN A WITCH FOR 300 YEARS, "AND IN ALL THAT TIME, I AIN'T EVER BEEN KISSED." SO HE STARTS TO KISS HER AND HE FINDS OUT, UGH... SHE'S THE UGLIEST WOMAN HE'S EVER SEEN-- I MEAN, REALLY, REALLY UGLY, ROLAND. BUT FOR WHAT SHE'S DONE, HE MUSTERS UP ALL OF HIS STRENGTH, TAKES HER IN HIS ARMS, AND HE GIVES HER A REAL SMACKO RIGHT ON THE LIPS. AND SHE'S SMILING UP AT HIM AND SHE SAYS, "HOW OLD ARE YOU, SONNY?" HE SAID, "38." SHE SAID, "AIN'T YOU KIND OF OLD TO BE BELIEVING IN WITCHES?" ( Roland coughing ) ( Roland laughing ) ( laughing continues) THANKS. I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS. Shirlee: I KNOW. ( coughing ) I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU THIS NERVOUS SINCE YOU AUDITIONED FOR BARNUM &amp; BAILEY. - BARNUM &amp; BAILEY. - THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. I WAS TERRIFIED AT THAT. WE'D BEEN MARRIED JUST A YEAR. IF I'D HAVE KNOWN THAT... I WAS GONNA BE A CLOWN THAT WASN'T GONNA AMOUNT TO VERY MUCH... I MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN ANOTHER BUSINESS. - OH... - NO, I MEAN IT. NO, DON'T SAY THAT. AND THERE I GO, BRINGING HOME EVERY BOY OR GIRL, EVERY KID OFF THE STREET. YEAH. YOU KNOW, JACK, WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, AND I LIVED IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE, I WAS LONELY. I HAD NO BROTHERS OR SISTERS. I HAD A LOT OF DOLLS, BUT I USED TO DREAM ABOUT HAVING A LOT OF KIDS WHEN I GREW UP. WELL, AFTER WE HAD JOELLA AND... ...WE FOUND OUT WE COULDN'T HAVE ANY MORE KIDS, I WAS TERRIFIED THAT SHE WAS GONNA GROW UP AS AN ONLY CHILD, AND THEN YOU... WHEN SHE WAS JUST A LITTLE BABY-- YOU CAME HOME WITH THAT LITTLE RAGAMUFFIN. - LOUIE. I BROUGHT HOME LOUIE. - LOUIE. OH, LOUIE, PINCH-FACED LOUIE. I LOVED YOU SO MUCH. COME HERE A MINUTE. MR. THUM, ROLL OVER ON YOUR RIGHT SIDE, PLEASE, AND PULL UP YOUR GOWN. FOR A MINUTE I FORGOT. YOU KNOW, FOR A GUY WHO MADE HIS LIVING ALL HIS LIFE BY DROPPING HIS DRAWERS, I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS SHOULD BE EMBARRASSING. ( chuckles ) I'M GLAD I DIDN'T MISS THE SHOW. THEY'LL BE UP TO GET YOU IN A FEW MINUTES. YOU'LL BE PRETTY DROWSY BY THEN. ALL RIGHT. - HIYA, SWEETHEART. - HI, JEETER. YOUR TIMING IS INCREDIBLE. PASTRAMI. HEAVY MUSTARD, LIKE YOU ASKED FOR. OH, THERE'S NO SMELL LIKE IT. THANK YOU. I'LL PUT IT BY MY PILLOW HERE. THIS PLACE COULD USE A LITTLE ATMOSPHERE. - HOW ARE YOU DOING? - FINE. FINE. YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO CAME IN LAST NIGHT. - WHO? - SMILEY. SMILEY? NO KIDDING? HE WAS SORRY TO HEAR YOU WERE SICK. WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GO AND OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND TELL HIM THAT I WAS SICK? CAN'T YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT? HE'S A FRIEND. HE ONLY WANTED TO HELP. - COME ON. - HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW YOU GUYS WERE FIXED. WE DON'T NEED ANY MONEY. TAKE IT EASY. OKAY, OKAY. HE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY IT. HIYA, FELLOWS. I'M SORRY, JACK. OH... IT'S ALL RIGHT, JEETER. YOU JUST... TAKE LIFE TOO SERIOUSLY, THAT'S ALL. HONEY, HONEY, I'LL BE HERE WHEN YOU GET BACK. YOU'D BETTER BE. I'LL TRY NOT TO TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY. IT'S A DOG-AND-PONY SHOW. ( grunts ) HI. - ( moaning weakly ) - NO. DON'T TRY TO TALK, HONEY. THEY HAD A TUBE DOWN YOUR THROAT FOR A LONG TIME. THE THROAT IS SWOLLEN. IF YOU TRY TO TALK, IT'LL HURT. THEY LEFT A PAD AND A PENCIL, SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY, WRITE IT DOWN. HERE, SWEETHEART. DR. ABRAHMS WILL BE BY TO EXPLAIN THE OPERATION TO YOU. I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS. YES, YES, JACK. THEY TOOK A LOT OF THE CANCEROUS TISSUE OUT. - ( moaning ) - NO, HERE. NO, HONEY, NOT ALL. ARE YOU IN PAIN? DO YOU WANT ME TO GET THE NURSE? WHAT? JACK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WRITE IT. - ( grunts ) - JACK. NURSE! DOCTOR! JACK, PLEASE. DR. ABRAHMS IS HERE. - WHOA. OKAY, PUT THAT BACK IN. - JACK. - COME ON, JACK. - COME ON NOW. - HELP THE DOCTOR, PLEASE, JACK. - STOP IT. YOU'LL TEAR OUT YOUR STITCHES. I'LL HELP. GIVE ME 10mg OF VALIUM, STAT. ALL RIGHT, JACK. PLEASE, JACK. ALL RIGHT, STOP, STOP. EASY, EASY. JACK, CALM DOWN. YOU'RE ONLY CAUSING YOURSELF PAIN. - ALL RIGHT. - JACK. PLEASE, JACK. PLEASE, JACK. OKAY. - ( grunting ) - EASY. JACK, PLEASE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, NOW BREATHE. JUST BREATHE AND RELAX. BREATHE AND RELAX. BREATHE, RELAX. UM... YOU CAN GO, NURSE. ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA TELL YOU STRAIGHT, JACK. YOU KNEW GOING IN THAT THE ODDS WEREN'T THE BEST. UH, WE-- WE COULDN'T GET IT ALL. THE MALIGNANCY HAD SPREAD TOO FAR. I'M SORRY. YOU SHOULD HAVE SIX MONTHS, MAYBE A YEAR. WHAT I NEED FROM YOU NOW IS... I NEED FOR YOU TO SLEEP. I'LL BE BY TO SEE YOU LATER THIS AFTERNOON. ( quietly ) OKAY. OKAY. OKAY. ( exhales ) SHIRL... ( inaudible ) ( applause on TV) He's off to a good start. Madeleine. Here you go... ( knocks on door ) - HI. - HI. THEY TELL ME YOU'RE ON THE HARD STUFF, SO I BROUGHT YOU A PASTRAMI SANDWICH. - JEETER SENT IT. - THANK YOU. I KNOW YOU NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO EAT THE OTHER ONE. I BROUGHT YOU CLEAN PAJAMAS, TOO. THANK YOU. AND HOW ARE YOU FEELING? FINE. GOOD. THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT YOU'LL BE COMING HOME ON FRIDAY. HE TOLD ME THAT, TOO. HI, ROLAND. HMM. IT'LL BE HALLOWEEN. THE KIDS ARE ALL EXCITED 'CAUSE YOU'LL GET TO SEE THEM IN THEIR COSTUMES. JACK, YOU SEEM SO FAR AWAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU. SHIRL, I'VE JUST... BEEN LYING HERE THINKING ABOUT MY LIFE. IT'S ALL SO POINTLESS. WHAT IS? THE OPERATION. GOING HOME. I'VE BEEN SO BUSY FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS TRYING TO WORK... I DIDN'T EVEN LOOK TO SEE THAT IT WAS-- THE WHOLE THING WAS POINTLESS. - ( moans ) - OH, NOW LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN TO ME. EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE HAS BEEN WORTHWHILE. YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS SAID THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T LAUGH ENOUGH. WELL, YOU'VE MADE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LAUGH, MILLIONS. SHIRL, LYING HERE, I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT MY LIFE-- THE THINGS I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT I DIDN'T DO, THE THINGS THAT I DID THAT I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO. MOST OF ALL... THE THINGS-- THE CHOICES THAT I MADE FOR YOU. I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THERE MIGHT BE A DAY WHEN I WOULDN'T BE THERE TO HELP YOU, YOU KNOW? JACK, STOP IT. NOW JUST STOP IT. ( sighs ) YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. YOU'RE GONNA BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. I DID ONE THING THAT... THAT COULDN'T BE ANY BETTER. WHAT WAS THAT? I MARRIED YOU. WELL... I DIDN'T DO TOO BADLY IN THAT, EITHER, DID I? I LOVE YOU, LADY. I LOVE YOU, TOO. ARE YOU AS TIRED AS YOU LOOK? IT'S NOT TIREDNESS, IT'S HELPLESSNESS. - MUST BE CATCHING. - YEAH. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SO LOW. IT'S AS IF HIS WHOLE LIFE DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. I KNOW. I TRIED TO TELL HIM, BUT HE DOESN'T HEAR ME. AFTER ALL THE KIDS YOU GUYS HAVE RAISED? BUT WHERE ARE THEY? THEY SHOULD AT LEAST CALL HIM SO HE KNOWS THAT THEY HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN HIM. I'LL TALK TO JACK. NO. HE NEEDS TO HEAR FROM THEM. THAT'S IT! I'M GONNA CALL THE KIDS. WHAT AN IDEA! WE'LL GIVE JACK ONE HELL OF A PARTY WHEN HE GETS OUT. DO YOU KNOW WHERE ALL THE KIDS ARE? MOST OF THEM. JOELLA IS IN DENVER WITH THE TWO GRANDKIDS. THE OTHERS-- I'VE GOT MOST OF THEIR NUMBERS. THEY'RE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. - WILL YOU HELP ME? - NAME IT. OKAY, YOU TAKE HALF. THEY ALL KNOW YOU. GIVE ME THAT CUP OF CHANGE THERE. THIS WILL COVER SOME OF YOUR CALLS. YOU TAKE THE PHONE ON THE WALL. Jack: BEFORE I GO, I THINK I OWE YOU ONE MORE STORY. THERE WAS THIS GUY WHO WENT FISHING OUT ON THE LAKE, AND HE TOOK A BIG BOTTLE OF WHISKEY WITH HIM. AND HE STARTED TO FISH, AND HE DIDN'T GET A BITE ALL DAY LONG. BY 4:00-- AND HE KEPT NIPPING AT THE BOTTLE AND FISHING AND NIPPING. BY 4:00, HE WAS PRETTY SMASHED, AND WITH NO BITES, HE DECIDED TO ROW IN. SO HE GOT IN JUST ABOUT 10 FEET FROM THE PIER, AND A 30-LB BASS JUMPED RIGHT INTO HIS BOAT, RIGHT OUT OF THE WATER INTO THE BOAT-- BANG! AND HE LIFTED UP THE FISH AND HE SAYS, "NO, NO, BUDDY, IF YOU DON'T BITE, YOU DON'T RIDE." AND HE THREW HIM BACK IN. ( chuckles ) HEY... ARE YOU MAD 'CAUSE I'M LEAVING? - HMM? - HMM. BECAUSE I'M GOING HOME. LUCKY BASTARD. - WHAT? - I SAID YOU'RE A LUCKY BASTARD. YEAH, I'M LUCKY. I'M DYING. - WHO ISN'T? - LOOK AT HIM-- NOW THAT I'M LEAVING, HE'S STARTING TO TALK TO ME. WELL, SOMEBODY HAS TO. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - YOU'RE WASTING IT. FORGET IT. YOU REALLY DON'T GET IT, DO YOU? EVERYBODY'S GONNA DIE, ONLY YOU, YOU'RE GOING HOME. YEAH, I'M-- I'M GOING HOME. BUT FOR HOW LONG? - A COUPLE OF MONTHS? - A LIFETIME! ROLAND, THIS CONVERSATION ISN'T DOING ME ANY GOOD. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING BUT YOUR OWN WHINING. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD ROLAND I KNEW, THE ONE THAT LAUGHED A COUPLE OF TIMES AT MY STORIES, BUT MOST OF ALL HE JUST SAT THERE AND GRUNTED? WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? HMM. THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. Shirlee: JACK IS COMING HOME TODAY. IT'S HALLOWEEN. UM... RALPH AND ALICE ARE GOING TRICK-OR-TREATING, AND I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT YOU'D LIKE TO DRESS UP AND GO WITH THEM, HUH? ZOOKY, WOULDN'T YOU LIKE THAT? HUH? OH, I HAVE A WONDERFUL COSTUME FOR YOU. YOU COULD PUT ON SOME OF JACK'S MAKEUP! OOH, YOU'D BE WONDERFUL! WHAT DO YOU SAY? ZOOKY. HMM? ALL RIGHT, WELL... HERE. IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, WILL YOU LET ME KNOW, HUH? OKAY. HEY, LADY, YOU GOT A SPARE ROOM FOR THE NIGHT? JEFF? ( laughing ) - OH, MY GOD. - HI, MOM. OH, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU WITH THE BEARD. OH, MY-- HOW DID YOU GET HERE? - I HITCHED. - FROM CALIFORNIA? - YEAH. - OH, YOU DEVIL. OH, YOU'RE COLD. COME ON. ALL THE KIDS ARE HERE, ALL OF THEM-- ALMOST ALL OF THEM, ANYWAY. YOU KNOW THAT AMY CAME, AND THE BABY? YEAH, YEAH. ROLAND, BEFORE I GO, I WANT TO SAY I DIDN'T MEAN IT-- YOU KNOW, ABOUT ALL YOUR GRUNTING. HMM. LOOK, I'VE ONLY GOT A FEW MINUTES. TALK TO ME. WHAT'S THERE TO TALK ABOUT? THAT'S BETTER. HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAD VISITORS HERE? OH... FOUR, SOMETIMES FIVE A DAY. WHY? ONE DAY YOU HAD 10. SO? I'VE BEEN HERE SIX WEEKS. NOT ONE VISITOR. ONLY ONE PHONE CALL, FROM MY MEDICAL INSURANCE. AND I GOTTA LISTEN TO YOU TELLING ME HOW YOUR LIFE IS OVER? I'LL PROBABLY NEVER LIVE TO SEE ANYTHING BUT THIS ROOM AND THE TOILET. AND WHEN YOU GO, THEY'LL GET SOME OTHER OLD MAN IN HERE, JUST LIKE ME. YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE ANYBODY TOLD ME A JOKE? ROLAND... I'LL, UH... I'LL BE BACK AND VISIT YOU, HUH? HMM. YOU'LL BE HOME FIVE MINUTES WITH YOUR FAMILY, AND YOU'LL FORGET I EVEN EXISTED. OH, COME ON. NO. YOU JUST WAIT. I'LL BE BACK. DON'T WAIT TOO LONG. YOU'LL COME IN TO FIND MY CHART GONE AND THE SHEETS STARCHED. ROLAND... I'M GLAD WE WERE BUNKMATES. ( knocks on door ) HEY, ROLAND, I'M BACK AGAIN, HUH? - COME ON, COME ON. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT THING? IT MAY NOT BE THE GREATEST DATE IN THE WORLD, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN ANOTHER TRIP TO THE TOILET. COME ON. COME ON OUT OF THERE. WHERE'S YOUR SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE? WE'RE GONNA ESCAPE OVER THE WALL, DOWN TO THE FARMHOUSE, WATCHING THE FRENCH GIRLS, UP TO THE PYRENEES, OVER THE ALPS, COME ON. - BUT-- - YOU GOT ME WANTING TO FEEL ALIVE AGAIN. I DON'T WANNA WASTE A MINUTE OF IT. COME ON, COME ON. OUT, COME ON. MY FRIEND... - WAIT A MINUTE. - ...THE TRAIN'S LEAVING. - GET YOUR ARMS BACK THERE. - I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. MAYBE THE BEST OFFER YOU'VE HAD ALL DAY. ( laughs ) - ARE YOU CRAZY, JACK? - YES, I'M CRAZY. ALL RIGHT, WHERE TO? MEN'S CLOTHES? TOY DEPARTMENT? LADIES' LINGERIE? ANYPLACE BUT THE MORGUE. HERE NOW. ISN'T THIS A BETTER VIEW THAN THE ONE YOU GET FROM YOUR BED? HMM. - YOU WARM ENOUGH? - HMM. OKAY, MR. T, YOUR TAXI'S READY. JACK? JACK? 12 FLOORS STRAIGHT DOWN. I WONDER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO DIE. I'M NOT DEAD YET. YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT SOMETIME. I SUPPOSE IT ISN'T MUCH LIKE ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR. ( chuckles ) HEY! HEY, THERE'S SHIRL DOWN THERE. HEY, SHIRL! SHIRLEE! SHE CAN'T HEAR ME. SHE'S PROBABLY WONDERING WHERE I DISAPPEARED TO. 12 STORIES. IT'S FURTHER DOWN THAN I THOUGHT. WHERE'S JACK? I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT HE WAS HERE. - WHAT HAPPENED? - I WENT TO HIS ROOM, AND HE WAS GONE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? DID HE CHECK OUT? NO, HE JUST WALKED OUT. NOBODY SAW HIM. DID YOU LOOK IN THE CHILDREN'S WARD? I LOOKED EVERYWHERE. HE'S GONE. MAMA, ISN'T JACK COMING HOME? I DON'T KNOW, SWEETHEART. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. COME ON, YOU GUYS. Jeff: YOU BE THE LOOKOUT THIS TIME, OKAY? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M SCARED. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? WHEN WE FOUND OUT JACK WAS SICK, I-- I FOUND HIM LOOKING THROUGH HIS INSURANCE PAPERS. WELL, TO PAY FOR THE HOSPITAL BILLS. THE ONLY THING THAT POLICY IS GOOD FOR IS ACCIDENTAL DEATH. SHIRL, JACK WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SUPPOSE I CAN THINK OF A WAY OF SAVING MY FAMILY THE AGONY OF WATCHING ME GO BIT BY BIT. THEY'D END UP-- END UP WITH 50 GRAND. YOU'VE GOT A FAST AND PROFITABLE WAY TO DIE? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? A COUPLE OF MONTHS THIS WAY OR THAT WAY, IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER. IF I HAD A CHOICE FOR DYING TONIGHT OR NEXT VALENTINE'S DAY, I'D GO FOR FEBRUARY 14th. THAT'S THE FUNNY THING ABOUT LIVING: YOU NEVER KNOW IF THE NEXT HOUR MIGHT BE THE BEST ONE OF YOUR LIFE. IT'S ADDICTIVE, LIKE EATING PEANUTS. IT'S GETTING COLDER. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE ENTERTAINMENT? ( singing "Thunder and Blazes" ) ( gasping ) ROLAND! ROLAND. ROLAND, LISTEN, WHAT'S THE MATTER? I'LL GET YOU DOWNSTAIRS. NURSE, PLEASE, CAN YOU HELP ME? ROLAND, YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT NOW. WAIT A MINUTE. BUDDY, LISTEN TO ME. YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. - WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN? - MISS, NEVER MIND ABOUT WHERE WE'VE BEEN. JUST HELP HIM. HELP HIM. - STAY WITH HIM. I'LL GET THE DOCTOR. - THANK YOU. LOOK, DON'T DIE. DON'T DIE, ROLAND. DON'T DIE. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE-- A COUPLE OF MONTHS MORE OR LESS? I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS SAYING. - DOCTOR. - YES, JACK. - DOCTOR, IS HE--? - UH-HUH. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. HOLD IT, HOLD IT. HE'S NOT--? DOCTOR, HE ISN'T GONNA... - DIE? - YEAH. EVENTUALLY, BUT NOT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. ROLAND, YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. DID YOU HEAR THAT? YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. HMM. DO ME A FAVOR. SURE. ANYTHING, BUDDY. WHAT? GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILY. I NEED TO REST. YEAH, I'LL GO RIGHT NOW. I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW. TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM, WILL YOU, DOC? THANKS. ( exhales ) - ( grunting ) - HERE WE GO. NURSE. DID YOU HEAR THE ONE ABOUT THE VERMONT FARMER AND THE GUY ON A MOTORCYCLE? THIS'LL KILL YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WAITING FOR YOU. SURPRISE! ( applauding, cheering ) DONNA. DONNA. HEY, STEVIE. HEY, BUDDY. HEY, BUDDY. HEY, STU. HEY. HEY, JEETER. HEY, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. DON'T TAKE LIFE SERIOUSLY, BABY, RIGHT? HEY, HEY, CALLIE. HOW ARE YOU, CALLIE? HEY, TONY, HEY. HELLO, FREDDY.
