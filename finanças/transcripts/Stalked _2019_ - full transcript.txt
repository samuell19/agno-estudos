One. Two. Good, two. Three. Four. Let's hold it there. Whoa, whoa, I said hold it. All right. Sorry. Let's take a break. Are you all right? Fine, but I'm knackered. You're knackered? You know they've been asking after you down at the barracks bar. You should try and get down sometime. I will. It's just difficult, you know. Yeah, and if you ever need a break, I can have a word with Sara. Thanks. You know, when you've got three already, you don't even notice another one. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah. C'mon, let's go again! Fists of fury! You're late. Sorry, Friday afternoon traffic. She'll be hungry. She doesn't usually eat this late. Packed a bag for her, you'll find dinner in there. She needs to eat as soon as you get home, okay? Okay. Mix four teaspoon fulls of baby oats and boiling water for her breakfast. Make sure it's cool enough before you give it to her. Are you even listening to me? Yes, sorry. Nappies, wipes, spare bottle, milk, it's all in there. You all right with this? Of course I am! See you Sunday! Craig? Take good care of her, okay? Ta-da! Let myself in. Thought you might try being out on me. You scared the shit out of me! Got any salt? We need to do slammers. So? Do you mind if we stay in? Have a couple glasses of wine, chill out? - Mm-mm-mm! - Chill out! Mm-mm, you are gonna have the best first night out a new mum's ever had. I don't know. I'm just not in the mood. I'll get some glasses. So, what happened to... What's his name? Jamal, was it? Ugh, another loser. Oh. He couldn't cope with a woman in uniform. Said I made him feel emasculated. I'd rather have a civvie than a squaddie any day. Yeah, well you didn't exactly pick a good one there, I'm afraid. Understatement of the year! He brought her around today. Did you demonstrate her that elbow's the hardest part of the body? It's him, not her. She's thick, he's an asshole. I'll drink to that. Yo, this is Craig, leave me a message. You're meant to keep your phone on, you dick. This is Sam. Can you call me, please? I haven't heard from you. I need a run. Oh God. Hey! Hey! Hey, baby, what's the matter? She's been like this all night. She's drenched! She's been burning up! Why didn't you call me? Did she drink her milk this morning? I don't know, I mean, ain't your mum a kiddie nurse or something? Can you call her? She lives 200 miles away, Craig. Maybe you should take her, eh? Maybe it'll work out better when she's older. She's got a temperature of 105. No, it's it out of hours. Okay, mum, you know best. No, okay, let me just write that down. Yeah? Uh-huh. Yes, I'll take her right away, all right? I could stop by this morning. Of course I'm not gonna leave her by hers. Grandma always knows best, doesn't she? If I put you in that pram, you're gonna freak out, aren't you? Okay? Oh, oh no, oh, it's all right. How 'bout the bouncer? The bouncer, we like to bouncer, don't we? Yeah, there you go. If your father wasn't such an asshole and still around, taking care of you'd be so much easier. Yeah, yeah. So I'm gonna go to the chemist's and get your medicine, and I'll be eight minutes, tops. Don't tell Gran, okay. Oh my God! Please! Someone let me out of here! Fucking! There's gotta be a way out of here. Get off me! Who's there? What do you want? Don't touch me! It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? What's your name? Stacy. Stacy, I'm Sam. Do you know a way out of here? There's nothing, Kelly looked everywhere. Who's Kelly? The girl who was here when I got here. Where is she now? What is that? It moves around. Do you remember how you got here? I was walking home from a club last night and woke up on the floor here. How did you get this? It. Listen to me, Stacy, my baby's at home by herself. She's five months old, I need to get out of here. And we can help each other. Find something, use it as a battering ram, try and smash the door down. That's what Kelly tried, it didn't like it. Well, we'll just try again, okay? Come on! Wait here. You've been here since last night, right? You've been all around the factory? Over and over, there's no way out. Have you seen a store room? Somewhere they might keep one of these? I can't remember. If I can find where the gas canisters are stored, this blowtorch will cut through that padlock. How do you know all this? Was in the 24 Commandos Engineers. Listen, I've got an idea. If we split up, we'll find it twice as fast. Come on, you survived in here a day already. You can do it. It'll come after us. But you think there's only one, right? Well then it's 50/50, and if it comes after one of us, the other has a chance to hook up the blowtorch and get out. Okay. If it comes after you again, you hit it as hard as you fucking can with this, okay? I'll take that end. You go that way. You okay? Let me out, please! Let me out out! Please! Come out. Or I go now to your home, and I kill the infant. You have 10 seconds. 10. Nine. Eight. Shit! Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. Stop! I can see you, you fucker. You want me to be scared, don't you? Well you can fuck off! Come on! Shit! Come on. Come on, come on! Please. Please, come on! No! Try to escape again, the infant dies. Play the game. Follow the truth. Not again, not again, not again. Not again, not again. Hey, hey! Help me, please! Please, can you undo these knots! I just wanted to look around. I don't want any trouble. How come you were tied up? I was kidnapped. Listen, the person who tied me up, he could be back here at any moment. How did you get in here? I'll show you. What was that? Bad news. If I get caught in here, my dad's gonna kill me. If we get caught by the person who tied me up, we're both in worse trouble than that. How far away from the jammers do you need to be to get a signal. Once I'm past the fence, I should be okay. As soon as you get there, call the police. Tell them that I'm here. Tell them that I've been kidnapped. Tell them to come as soon as possible. Listen, this is serious, okay? Okay. What if I get into trouble? You won't. You promise? I promise. Now go! Hey! Hey! Wake up! Where am I? It's a factory. Do you remember anything? I was at work this morning. I don't usually work Saturdays, but I had a client meeting. The car park was deserted. I went to get in my car and someone grabbed me. The same thing happened to me. You're joking. Am I on a TV show or something? One girl is dead, possibly two. Oh my God. Phones don't work here. Listen, the man who kidnapped you, he thinks I've escaped. He's gone out to look for me, but I doubt we have long. We don't have much time. Well, there's two of us, we could overpower him. You're gonna think I'm nuts, but he has some kind of stealth suit. I know I sound crazy, but I used to be in the military. This place, it makes serious hardware, quantum stealth armor plating for tanks. Things I've never even seen before. I heard rumors about stealth suits and the advancements... So who is this person, does he work here? I don't know! What happened to your face, your arm? He did it to me. He likes to scare you. And then, when he thinks you're scared enough, he gets off on killing you. You said he think you've escaped, so there's a way out? There is, a disused ventilation shaft. Let's go! Shit, he's coming! The best thing you can do is play dead. He'll want to scare you, but just play along with it. He likes to toy with us, but I promise, he won't kill you straight away. He thinks I've escaped. My guess is he's gonna come and check on you and then go again and look for me. No, I don't believe you. What if he's angry and he takes it out on me? He won't be. He needs to find me or he's fucked, believe me. I am staking my baby's life on it! This is so fucked up! Just do as I say, and we'll get through this. Are you okay? Yeah. Let's go! I love my daughter, Amy. She's five months old. I had no choice, I had to go and get her medication, and I thought I'd only be gone a few minutes. That's when he got me. He said if I try and escaped, he'd kill her. I'd rather he was in here searching for me than going after her. Surely someone will hear her. I'm the only single mum on the Army barracks, no one's there at the weekends. I'm sure it'll be okay. This is it. Think you can get through there? We'll see. Your phone should work outside the perimeter fence. How do you know? A kid broke in, I told him to to call the police. He's the one that showed me the hole. Right. Wish me luck. What can you see? A canal. Beyond that, nothing. Looks like we're in the middle of nowhere. Can you get across it? Yeah, I think so. Oh my God. What is it? The boy, he's dead. Oh God. Are you okay? Hello? Oh! Okay! Think, Sam, think, come on! I know you are in here. There is no way out. Show yourself. Do it quickly, and I will kill you quickly. Resist, and it will be slow. Resist, and I will also kill your child. That is all. Fat chance, fuckhead! We need to be quiet. I played dead. It doesn't know the difference as long as you don't move. I'm impressed. Before I was a medical rep, I was a nurse on the side. I saw a few gunshot wounds. How did you get out? I stabbed him. He's dead. He's a janitor. Must've stolen stuff that he saw. Does it work? I think so, but the battery's low. It powers up through the wrist. It's charging. Must have two suits. Switching between them as the power ran down. These are electro-active polymers. Seems that anything touching the polymers forms a circuit and is also cloaked. You okay? I'd rather be in here and in pain than out there with that thing. I found a first aid kit in the kitchen. The wound's clean so it won't get infected. I have to get by on codeine as a painkiller till Monday when the place opens up. That's not an option for me. The power level's low, but you could try it. Do you think it could get me past the drone? Who knows? I've got no choice. This turns it on. How is it in there? All right, apart from the smell. Ready. Can you see me? Not a thing. It's so freaky. The power's low. How much you got? Five percent. Better get a move on. Okay. Good luck. Thanks. Please no! Police, please, I was kidnapped. Two others were kidnapped, too. At least two people here are dead. Four was pinned here. And two shot. King Henry Way, it's a military facility, King Henry Way near Lemington. I don't know, some kind of factory producing military equipment. No, it doesn't register on any of the maps. Okay. GPS coordinates are 337, .557, .332. Yeah, okay, thanks, but I can't wait here. My five month old is at home, and she's been on her own for two and a half hours. Yeah, it's all right. Thank you, please come quickly, okay. Berenice, I know you're gonna kill me, but if you get this, get the spare key. Go to the flat as soon as possible. Amy's alone. I'm not far, I'll be with you as soon as I can, and I'll explain everything. I'm okay. Please, can you help me? My baby's alone, I was kidnapped. I need to get back her. Well, of course, get in. Do you want me to call the police, love? Already have, they're on their way. Right. Oh baby! Mommy is so sorry she left you. Hey, hey, Mommy's here, Mommy's here, Mommy's here, darling! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Hello darling. Where are you? You're not gonna believe this, sweetheart, but I was pulled over by this girl. She says she's been kidnapped. Right, and where is that girl now? Well, I'm outside her flat. I've just dropped her off. She says her baby's been left alone. I hope she's okay, poor thing. And have you called the police? Well, she says she's already called them. You are so full of shit. It's true! Why are you even at work today at all anyway? Look, I've already told you, Pavel didn't come in for his shift again. I am sick of your excuses. I can't believe that you're actually hiding from your wife and your brother-in-law like a pathetic little boy. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please, don't be angry with me. Don't bother coming home. It's okay, dear, it's okay. I've got something to say to you. I'm not afraid.
