Oh no! Oh, my goodness! Five thousand two hundred and fifty! Five thousand two hundred and fifty, gross, of course! What are you saying? Sleep, my dear Jean-Ba! Sleep! You not having anything? I can't, with five thousand two hundred and fifty! That's my salary... The salary of a loser! Hey, godfather, I'm lucky to get five thousand two hundred and fifty! My poor Jean-Ba! Hey, knock it off, those aren't our letters. And you said there was no point reading other people's mail! Do we get any letters? Never. And my hobbies, do you ever think about my hobbies? I told you to insure your collection! Your stamps. You had Marigny Square, the Philatelic Club, it took you three whole days. Oh, that was swell... Only, since then, I found out you can keep the letters along with the stamps! - Promise me, godfather. - What? Swear it. Don't mess with channel two today, OK? Leave me the sound, at least. They're playing La gazza ladra. La gazza ladra! His mom's influence! Any news? A tax calculation in Mr. Sulser's waste basket. His taxes? I couldn't say... I threw it out. You idiot! - July or August? - Vacation days? Since you didn't want to do it. Well, it kind of depends on my cousin, Dorothée. She's going to Greece with her friends, so... July or August? Well, August, I guess. - There you go. - Put August. July? What is it, Lum? Sorry to disturb you, Mr Calot, it's about vacation days. Are you and Mrs. Calot still going to Saint-Jean in July? - Why? You want to come too? - Not at all. No, it's just about the date, for the company... Ah... I see, well... have you spoken to Ponte? - Yes. - When's he going away? August. Well, just leave me down as July. Of course. Sebaz! So, Sebaz, you've not been here a year, right? Nine months, sir. Just as I thought, you're only allowed three weeks. So? July? August? It's still a little early, no? You have to decide now. It's because of my mom, you know? Oh, so you have a mother, huh? Right: we'll put July, I need some for then! From the first to the fifteenth, twice. Ah! It's you, Lum. Stay standing, stay standing. It's the vacation chart, sir. - Huh? - The vacation chart! Could you write it down... there! Vacations, vacations, always vacations! You think we have vacations, Lum? Well then. So, very well. - Do you need me for anything else? - Huh? - May I leave? - Yes! Out, out! Ah Lum, Lum. Tell your colleagues I'm coming to see them in the cafeteria. All of them. In half an hour. Oh! It's very important. Do your best to scare them. It's not the Germans! Ah! It's you! I told you it was important, right? May I have your attention? Now, listen here, my friends, I've been looking for something to reward you with. I really thought about it, and finally it was Rose, Rose is my wife... who said, "What if we invited them over? All of them." She said, "Yes, invite all of them over." Only, if I invited you to my place in Paris, rue Chambiges... Yes, Demaret, yes, rue Chambiges, that's right, 8th district, 2nd floor, 200 square meters, plus balcony. No, rue Chambiges, that just wouldn't do. You'd think you were working overtime! And that's when Rose mentioned Granat. She said, "So ask them to come to Granat." Granat is our country house, you know. I suppose you have nothing to do next weekend, at least, there's time for you to rearrange, right? So, perfect. Do you all have a pen and paper? Ready? OK, so, Granat, Granat. Freeway A3, third exit. You arrive in a village, that's not it, OK? You just need to turn left, left, and left again. That will bring you to a church, a little road on the right, that's the road you have to drive down. Straight ahead, keep going straight. You'll arrive at a crossroads and there, go left. And you're at my place. You'll hear the dogs. Right. We'll leave on Friday after lunch, no stress. Back on Sunday. Any questions? So we'll sleep at your place, sir? Yes. Is that all? Do we come alone, sir, or with our wives? Could you repeat that, Ponte? Please, nice and loud! No, no, it's fine, sir. OK then. If it's fine for Ponte, it's fine for everyone! We might as well change the channel. Huh? Didn't you want to watch Médicale? La gazza ladra, Médicale... that's a lot. Come on Jean-Ba, out with it! Out with it! You'll feel better. I'm not hiding anything, godfather. I tell you everything. Huh! Is it the Spanish? That bunch of cleaning ladies! I won't be here this weekend. - What's the occasion? - Joeuf has invited us to stay. Us? You and me? No, godfather, the employees at the office. Why has he invited you? I guess he figured we'd like it. I don't know. It's going to be horrible. It is horrible. And where are you going? Rue Chambiges, in the countryside? In the countryside. At Granat, can you imagine? Very well, thank you. What about me? What will become of me, all alone? - Did you think of that? - Yes. I checked the guide. On Saturday, there's Auto-Moto. Oh Jean-Ba, why not say you're sick? In 11 years, I've never missed a day, they'd never buy it. How much do you want? Oh no... Go ahead. Run along! Don't eat that, Mr. Calot. They touch it with their fingers. - You think so? - I saw them. You've come to visit me, it's very nice of you. - You need a ride tomorrow? - That'd be nice, but that's not... I won't take no for an answer, you're coming with me. We'll leave from my place, I'm on the way. I'll join you in Route de la Reine. That's right, at one o'clock. No need to come up. Just wait downstairs. Why? I'll be discreet. Yes, but the neighbors, the janitor... You never know! They don't know you. At one o'clock! - Yes - Right. One o'clock. So, have you chosen? Not again, godfather. I already said I can't get out of it. Don't be silly. I'll do what I like. I know where everything is here. The matches, the gas faucet. All of it! Quiet, you'll scare the neighbors! I hope so! Did you leave me any cash? You have everything, cash, the phone number, even the address. - How much cash? - One hundred. Do you know how much the slightest whim costs? Here! I can't be bought. Oh, José, listen. Ah! Don't touch me! Hello! Do you mind if we take a look in your little bag there? There's nothing unusual, Mr. Calot. Ah, but my dear Lum, you know that I always search my passengers before setting off. Always. OK, it's fine. Quit messing around with the window, OK? Sorry. Where can that church be? Nowhere near here! You should have turned left, left and left again, and you did the complete opposite. You could have said! I was thinking of this weekend, Mr. Calot. Our colleagues, the office. Are you worried? Ah! Tell yourself, my dear Lum, that we are all worried. - Even at your level? - Well, yes, at all levels. - Do you like him, Joeuf? - He's the boss. That's for sure. And his daughters, have you met them before? Odile and Nathalie? No, I don't know them. No. I mean, I hear that they are easy... Here you are! What's the matter, did you get lost? I told you, turn left three times, it's not rocket science! OK, put those down, put your bags down over there, come on, be quick about it. Come on, Mr. Calot, stand between Ponte and Ciré. Come on Lum, make an effort. Wherever you want. Let's get it over with. Come on! Everyone in position. Come on! Press the button, dear, fear not! That's it... No, no! Hey we have to do two! We won't have both girls in the same picture. Let's ask Fabre, then! Where is he? Fabre, my God Fabre, what is he... For goodness sake! I can take the photo. Hey, Vezir, give it a rest, will you? It's my employees' weekend, right? Sir? Get behind the camera, click the button when I say so. Go ahead, we're all ready. Click, Fabre. - Ouch! - Ah! I didn't get Miss Odile. Yes, I saw, thank you. Can't you just stand there? Have you been smoking? No! I slipped. Never mind. We'll do a montage. I know guys who can do that. OK everyone, out of the photo. Miss... Miss... Could you tell me where the toilets are? Follow me. I'm going, too. It's in there. I'm sorry about before... your foot... - It was an accident. - Don't be sorry. You know very well it was no accident. If your dad found out. If dad found out, he'd throw you out of here like a dog! Are you going to tell him? We'll have to see... later on... Who asked you to do that? Oh, I don't mind, sir. I hope you didn't knock anything over, because Fabre... No, sir, I swear. It's fine, really, leave it. I didn't bring a jacket. Sorry, old boy, I only brought one. So, is no-one going to drink anything? Oh, don't tell me you're not thirsty? I'd love an orangeade, if you have it, I wouldn't say no. But I have everything, are you kidding? Anyone else? Oh, an orangeade would be nice, you know, that'd be lovely. Orangeade, orangeade, orangeade, three, four, orangeade, Lum? I'd love a Martini... Now we're getting it. Bianco? No, Rosso. With a little slice. Yes, try to get them to have a drink, because these fruit juices don't do it for me. A little scotch or a Martini will wake them up. We're lacking ambiance. - No. - Ah. Sorry, you wouldn't have a slice of orange, would you? I'm used to drinking Martini with a thin slice of orange from Israel or California. Yes, well go see Fabre for that. Don't push it, alright? Do you understand? But it has been redone, the whole building has been redone. So, is everything OK? Oh yes. I'm glad. That's the photos from last year, August, I know them. You're all on 400 points, right? No, I'm on five hundred twenty-five! Ah, I didn't see you there, Calot. Excuse me. Would you leave us for a second? What is this about? Don't try that tone with me, Demaret. Management put you on four hundred and fifty recently. Are you complaining? So, a little guessing game for those under four hundred. A hotel room in the area, with amenities, breakfast, how much would that cost? Per day. - Eighty. - Oh! One hundred ten? One hundred thirty? Getting warmer. Between one hundred and eighty and two hundred! Oh, because you think I have 20,000 francs to lose, making sure you're in bed? Aren't we sleeping here? Ah no, Blanpain, no, you're not sleeping here. But you said that we... Have you seen the house? Did you see how big it is? Makes sense, right? You'll be fine up at the Bellevue. Real cozy. Is it a modern hotel? Yes, modern, comfortable, - everything you need! - And very discreet, too. If you know what I mean. I heard she's easy... Do you need something, Sebaz? Oh, no, I mean, it's about my motorbike... Will it be safe, sir? It's the company bike, after all. So you will refrain from calling it "my" motorbike then, Sebaz! Right? No, leave that for the staff. Wait a minute, who do you think you are? He's on his own, you know... Looking after us! But no, he's not on his own, there are two of them. There are two of them. What did Joeuf say to you earlier? The lower salaried will sleep at the hotel. Is your salary as low as all that? Five thousand two hundred and fifty. - Gross? - Yes, gross. My goodness. I can't help you with that, of course. I can't do anything. It's a shame, we could have chatted in the room, got to know each other... Chat, sure, but about what? About us... about all of us. Right? You know, Sulser won't shut up about Kenya, safaris. Haven't you heard him? You know very well that we don't eat at the same table, Mr. Calot. You're definitely not where you should be. Definitely not in the right place. That's what my godfather says every day. Oh yes? Listen, no. That said... It's better if we're not seen together so much. Well, excuse me, I'll return to my group. They wouldn't understand... Are you OK? How about you, Miss Odile? No, I'm not at all OK. Mother put me next to the losers at dinner. No, that's wonderful! We'll be seated together! - Because... - Oh yes! Ah, indeed, that changes everything. Hotel Bellevue... it seems you know it? The soap is a bit small, but enough for one wash. Ah well, you two are getting along famously! Is it true you made a scene with your mother? It seems you didn't want to sit next to young Lum? - Who is Lum? - Him. Yes. I've never really liked the countryside. I came here... - I came for... - Dinner is served, sir. For the family, for the kids. Dinner is served, sir! Ah! Let's go. Off we go. Keep your glasses, I think we're missing some. Your husband really does have a good nose for business. For instance, the Amoco Cadiz, the oil tanker that ran aground in Brittany, well he had previously refused to insure the owner of this tanker and... The guy used pliers to tear off my nail, but it's fine, it's nothing, he gave me an injection beforehand, it bleeds a lot, you know, especially the extremities, because extremities are painful. And do... do the... Take the potatoes away, Fabre, you know we have some later... With your fingers, use your fingers, what's the harm? We haven't got all day, we're family here. Ha! It's silly things, for example... There you are, Miss. It's this glass. Well, perhaps we should... make a toast? I have no idea. André! André! My darling, shall we make a toast? Friends, a toast to the company! To all our foolish customers and all those we manage to fool in the future. Are you not eating? I am allergic to raw foods, Mr Lum. - Oh. May I? - Of course, yes. Fabre! - Do you want mine, too? - Do you think I'm going hungry? I'm doing it to put her at ease. Would you mind picking up my napkin? - I don't see it. - Take another look... Take a good look. - But it didn't fall down! - Pretend it did. Come and get it, nice and easy. - Are you crazy? - The napkin, Lum! - Did you notice? - What? I'm not wearing any. I never do, in this weather. Working methods have changed a lot, you see, with telex, computers... but I think that, in terms of the environment, we have to respect traditions, for example, Mr. Calot wanted to repaint the woodwork with Ripolin, and well, I said no. We should respect traditions, wood is a living thing, it tells a story... Jasmina! ...the sweat of those before us... Wait, it'll come back to me... What do you do at the office? I'm in the flights department, short flights. - And you, are you studying? - Not at all. I left school at 16. I was sick. Very sick. A serious illness, Miss Odile? It was my nerves. I'd try to kill myself over the slightest thing! Thank God that's over, right? Yes... Well... My father says that people who really want to die never fail. He often tells me about Montherlant putting his revolver in his mouth. - Are you married? - No. It's always been love that's cured my depression. - Physical love, of course. - Yes. I had my first sexual experience quite late, though. I was 17. That's my sister's age. We were told of two lions that had returned to the farm and in order to catch them... Keep your voice down, Miss Odile! Don't worry, my parents know. I tell them everything. They had no choice, either I was free with my body, or I took my own life. It's not just for your parents. What? You mean the employees? Daddy spits on them, if you want to know. He talks about them with such contempt. He's going to fire a bunch of them. He put this weekend on so they'd take the news better. What you are telling me is dreadful! Not for you. You're not under threat. Last night, daddy gave us the names of those who risk the chop. There was no mention of Lum. - What about Lumet? - Who is Lumet? - Me. - You have two names? No, it's not that, Lumet is my real name, it's my whole name. But my colleagues call me Lum. No, I don't recall that. Bravo! Yeah! The cake is for my sister. She's 17 today. Daddy killed two birds with one stone. I'm not a napkin! Just one word, Lum, and I'll stamp on your foot. Don't you get it that I want you? Come on, sing! Like everyone else! Nathalie! Nathalie! Ah! Being 17 is wonderful. Happy birthday, my darling. Oh! If we'd known we would have brought a present! Oh, she already has everything! Right, darling? She knows it, too, come here! Come on, Fabre, champagne! Ah! Champagne! Another good memory, yes! Remember? It's the one we got for free when we won the contract. Happy birthday. Should I go kiss her too? Happy birthday. - Lovely cake, isn't it! - Hmm. Here, let's add it to your hips! - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Ah, yes Jasmina! - Ouch! What are you doing! - I'm so sorry. That's right, apologize, cretin. I'm calling over my dad! No! No, I won't do it again, it's the wine. It's the birthday. Sorry, please forgive me, I'm sorry. Well look here... Always the last one, huh, Lum? You see Lum, well Lumet, has worked for me for... how long has it been now? Eleven years, sir. Eleven years. Can you imagine, Nathalie? You were six when I hired Lum! Indeed! Mr. Joeuf, I'd like to talk to you alone for a minute. - Now? - Yes, real quick. Please, just one minute... I swear, just one minute, no more, if... Well, come along then. So, what's wrong, Lum? Oh, everything is fine, Mr. Joeuf. No, it's not. You want to talk, so talk! Here we are. I'm listening, shoot! It's a little bird. What little bird? A little bird told me a few things. What things? Things that are not very nice, Mr. Joeuf, not nice at all. In Havana, they roll the leaves on their thighs. May I quickly call my mom? Yes, it's down there. That must be the school of Puvis de Chavannes, Yes, it's beautiful. Oh yes indeed. OK, I'm going to see if I can find the John. And it has a very characteristic sound. Hey, I can't do everything. So then you have to warm it up, gently, because of the tobacco leaves. It really is amazing. Mr. Sulser, may I have a cigarette? A cigarette, no, I don't think I have any on me. Ah no, I don't have any, sorry. Ah, hang on, wait a minute... Here you go! You see, the little bird knows the score. Yes, by "little bird", you mean Odile? You think I didn't see you glued to her all through dinner? You know, Lum, I have two daughters. One is ten out of ten, never a problem. The other one? Zero points... A good average, at least. But she's still my daughter. She's not a maid, she's not an employee. I can't just fire her on a whim. What are you doing? Cigar, Lum? I don't smoke cigars. They're too big. Listen, Lum. I'd like us to have fun this weekend. OK? So forget about all this. You have drinks, food, even my daughter, if you want a home run. She did the napkin trick, right? Ha! So what are you complaining about? I'm not, it's just... this talk of downsizing. I can't bear to keep such a secret to myself. Do you know how much people like Ciré or Calot earn? Do you know how much their personal calls cost? And their business dinners. Business! That's a joke! I'm paying for a swarm of locusts! That's not my problem, I'm not the boss. Oh please, Lum! Go have fun! We'll talk tomorrow! I'm tired today and irritated. This weekend's a drag. I already put up with them all week. And you know, at the moment, I have other problems to deal with. - Wait, wait. - There you go! - What kind of cigar is it? - Oh, a Havana! - Oh sorry! - Mr. Gatti! Sorry. How do you plan to tell them? What exactly is it that you want? To take away the few years that I have left to live? Are you going to tell them here? Well, that's enough now, don't push it. Off you go. I want three hundred thousand old francs! - What for? - To... What would you do with 300,000 francs? Why? You want to give me more? I'd prefer cash... if you have it. Help yourself! Do you have any Delacroix? No, but I have a Dufy if you want. Smaller notes are easier. And that's six! You disappoint me, Lum. I never would have expected this from you. But the small scope of your blackmail shows who you are. Do you have an envelope? So then the rhinoceros said, "that's not a cabbage!" Has Po nte been bangingold Ciré for long? I think it's actually... their first real weekend... Aren't you dancing, Mr. Lum? Oh no, I'm looking after these. - Where are you going? - To bed. - With my shoes? - Oh! Sorry. I mean, I can do without... - So, are you going to the hotel? - Yes. We'll take you, buddy. - As you're on foot. - Thanks. Got a reservation? I'm Mr. Joeuf's daughter. Is Roger not here? He stole from the rooms, your Roger! Your names, please. Blanpain, Patrick. And Lumet, Jean-Baptiste. - There's a group of us. - And Miss? Miss will sleep with Sir! Well, may I have my key now? You have number twelve, two times six. Thank you. A little kiss? I bet he has a little one! Oh Sebaz, come on in! It's dreadful, Mr. Lum. Yes, I know. A courier can easily find a job again. Why do you say that? Because you're in tears, my dear Sebaz. I'm consoling you. - It's Solange. - Solange? Kiss me, Mr. Lum. I beg you! What happened exactly? Solange doesn't love me anymore. She said I was just a fling. But that's odd, you're quite a catch! Really! It serves you right, that'll teach you to mix work and pleasure! This is not a study weekend, Mr. Lum. It's much worse Sebaz, you'll see. No Sebaz, don't get so upset. Not for a typist who writes "scheme" with two "m's"! Two "m's", Sebaz! Especially at your age. How old are you? Thirty-four. I am ashamed for you, frankly I am ashamed for you. Maybe you just failed her, where it counts. - "Failed"? - Sexually. I don't think I failed her, as you put it. You don't think? Well, there you go! Ah! Sebaz, doesn't think so! You have to be sure, man, she might have been faking. They all fake it, Sebaz. Pretend I'm Solange: I say to myself, "Let's give Sebaz a go, with his lovely skin..." I try it and I don't like it, well not enough. So what do I do? I find someone else. But who? Someone like Gatti, Lenoir, Sulser... someone with a car. You think it's the bike? Right, dry your eyes. Meet me at reception in ten minutes. - For sure, right? - I'll get dressed and come down. - Promise, Lum? - Mr. Lum. You got a helmet for me? It's not far. Just five minutes. So be nice and give me yours! Sleep well, Lum? - Ready for the walk? - What walk? In a weekend... let me explain: there's a Friday, a Saturday and a Sunday. And if I'm counting correctly, it's only Saturday morning. I have to keep them busy, your colleagues, your superiors. So, a walk. But where? Oh, there's always a priest or a church. Some may want to confess... Who are you thinking of? Blanpain? Well yes, Blanpain among others. Do you have any questions? Ah no, it's full. Excuse me! No, you can see how many of us there are in here. I think I'll take my car, too! I already said "no" to that. Who? I said, "who?" Ah, but it's Demaret. Demaret! So, I'm all ears, Demaret! You believe in God? Yes, why? You doing a survey? How it has changed! It's crazy! This is where I got married. At that time, we had nothing, Rose and I. She was expecting Odile. Odile, Blanpain, my daughter! The priest thought he was Bernanos, he spoke to us about mutual trust, of good and evil, whites and blacks. One day, I got tired of him, I had him transferred to the northern suburbs. They replaced him with a hunchback. It was annoying, because we always had to check if he'd washed his hands... A hunchback's hands, you understand, you always have to be wary, suspicious. I ended up forcing him to wear gloves to hand us the wafer. Rubber kitchen gloves! A gift from Rose. I'd bought her a dishwasher, they were new at the time, so she didn't need gloves anymore. You see, Demaret? That's why I believe in God. Because of a dishwasher. You push a button and ping! The dirt is gone. Amazing! When you think about it. I also remember there being a garden at the back of the church. Hey Calot, you didn't forget the... No, I put it in the car. Well, in the trunk. We need a referee! What are we playing? Dodgeball, do you know it? Yes! Shall we make it interesting? Ah no, it's too early, Lenoir. What's the matter? You seem nervous today. What's up, Lenoir? - Let's go! - Let's go, very well. You'll make a very good referee. OK, let's go. So, let's make it easy, for teams Hotel Bellevue against my house. There are more of you! Yes. So? Does that bother anyone? Go, go! Justify your wages, get your suits dirty! - Hurt them! - There are no rules! Be a man, that's the rules. Go for their legs! Go for their legs, their shins! Mr. Joeuf! Good God, hey! Ah, here we go! Come on! Give me that, you cretin. - Ah. - Ahhhh! She's injured! - I didn't want to play! - Solange! Do me the pleasure of going back to your place! Can't you see she's hurt? It's just a game! And there we have it! That's how we lose wars. She's bleeding. Take her away! Did I touch her? Well? Well, you didn't miss! Well then, let's keep going. Come on, how many more are there to beat? There's just Blanpain and I, but if Mr. Lenoir agrees, we're willing to surrender. You don't need Lenoir to surrender, Lum. - Give us a break. - He's the referee. And who am I? Yes, of course... Want to swap shirts? What for? In the matches on TV... And? Do you see any cameras? Shall we have a little bite to eat? - Anyone peckish? - Ah! Well, that's what it's there for. Go ahead, help yourselves! Hey, no shoving! No shoving, there's only one kind: roast beef. It's good! No thanks, we've already eaten. Too much! Look, I feel like I'm going to burst! Did you bring trunks? Hmm! I have English skin, you know. England! Do you remember, girls? Girls... Do you know? Do you think the world revolves around you? You know, it's me who is behind a lot of things. What a schmuck! The ride cost 200,000. Yes. What's all this? - Let me explain, it's... - Will you introduce me? My godfather, José Viss. Mr. Joeuf, erm... - Delighted. - Ah! Don't worry, I wasn't followed. - Will you excuse me? One moment. - Of course. I couldn't stand being alone. Did he really charge you 200,000? How did you manage that? He put me on Province rates from home... Where did you get the suit? A bit tight, huh? I never gave you access to my bank account. Your weekend costs a lot of money! Godfather, please... Where can I put this? Ah! Not at my place! Ah no! - He put us in the hotel. - Right. Us? You and I? No, the lower salaried employees. - Right. - Five thousand two hundred and fifty! You think that's normal? You can't stay here. I'll drive you to the station. There is one, right? Yes, the three o'clock. Change at Chailly. - Move aside! - Good day! Move aside, nothing to see! Good day! Did I miss much? Sorry, I don't think I understand, Lum... - You are this gentleman's godson? - Well... yes. Maybe we should feed him, too? No, I ate in the taxi. Do you think I could get him a room at the hotel tonight? Well you certainly have enough money! Unless you've spent it all? What money? Your godson will explain. Enjoy your afternoon, Lum. Just relax. So can he stay? It won't make the other colleagues jealous? I don't want there to be a misunderstanding. I like your godfather! Excuse me. Any chance of a coffee? It'll ruin your afternoon nap. - Afternoon nap? - Well, yes. I need to rest. Don't you? Yes. OK. A little nap... It won't do any harm. - Are you sure it's the same one? - Same one? - The same as yours. - Mine? - The curtains... - What about them? They're thinner than yours! Oh! And I don't sleep well... Do you want to swap? Now it's all sorted. Right. So, I suppose you want a rest? A rest from what? We have things to discuss, don't you think? The three beauties in the garden, who are they? - You saw them? - Has he hired them for the weekend? More like hire purchase! It's his wife and two daughters. Oh. - But they sleep around. - How do you know that? I know everything, my dear Jean-Ba. Women are like stamps. They're either new or dog-eared. What did you eat in the taxi? Sardines, why? - You got it down you! - Oh! - Of course. - Oh yes! Mr. Joeuf mentioned some money... - How much? - Three thousand. That will barely cover the cab and the suit. How did you get it? Thanks to a little bird. - That was only worth three grand? - It was unnegotiable. That said, I got it in cash. Good. What did you give him for that? My silence. Come on, Jean-Ba, I'm exhausted. Out with it! It's Mr. Joeuf. He's downsizing the office. What? You're being laid off? How many of you? I don't have the numbers, but I'm not being targeted. When is he firing them? Later on. He might do it here. In my room? No! Down by the sandwiches. In public, then? Knowing him, it could be dramatic. I admire you, man. They tried to teach me bridge, but I never understood it. It's really nice of Joeuf to invite us here, huh? I mean, he didn't have to. You really have to concentrate, huh? You don't give a damn what I say, huh? - And she loved you? - She was crazy. You can still ask the firefighters on duty. What did you talk about? Nothing. Not a word! Did you meet her at avenue Marigny, among the stamps? Her teeth were like Hungarian stamps, pointed, even... The arms of a sower. A stomach as soft and smooth as the back of a first day stamp. A tongue ready to moisten it! And did she make food for you at the theater? I would set the table, boil the water, and she would salt it before throwing the pasta in. She had water in her dressing room? Hot and cold. Only one tap, so you could mix it. But what was missing? Honesty, my dear Jean-Ba, honesty. Damn! It slipped! Don't move, I'll get it. Here! I've never seen smaller soap! Miss Odile said it was enough for one wash. Odile... Did you visit her? No. She's a chatterbox. So, my dear Jean-Ba, how long has it been? You know very well you won't let me bring girls home. Well, the pigeons at Marigny, they do it outdoors. Pigeons, indeed! So, how long? Two? Two years? And a half! Would you go with Rose Joeuf? Where? No... erm... It's stupid, we could have asked to share a room. Well, I slept for a little while. It doesn't hurt, does it! - Oh, really? - Didn't you? Because nothing bothers you about this weekend? Bother me? Sometimes, Calot, you have to keep your eyes open. That game of dodgeball, for example. Did it seem OK to you? Oh, I'll tell you straight, old boy, I don't give a damn! I don't know, all this is hiding something. Something bad. Smell that, Calot! Can you smell it? Are you leaving? Do you have a newspaper? Are you sure you don't want to come? No, I told you I have to work. You brought some mail? Here, this one is from Tuesday. I'll do the spot the difference game. Call me when you get back. - Even if it's late? - Especially if it's late. - Are you sure you don't... - Go! - We said six o'clock, right? - Oh! Two minutes! Come in. Sit yourself down! Everything OK? Better than you, I bet! And Lum? Jean-Ba, he just left for your place with his friend, the courier. So... this needn't take too long. That depends on you. I thought I was very good to... Jean-Ba, as you call him. I don't think so! What do you think? Do you imagine I'd come all this way, just to gobble up your sandwiches! And what exactly do you know? The whole shebang! Look, your godson is a good guy, he's exemplary when it comes to discipline and conformity, but doubling his salary is a bit much to ask. Please, 412 12 12. But that's my number! No point calling my place, nobody's home! Who do you want to talk to? Ciré, Calot, the bigwigs. Oh, don't do that, you wretch. Ten thousand five hundred. You're quite a negotiator, eh? I once sold one with no teeth for a million francs! - You sold a toothless man? - A stamp. Say, that's a lot of money, and what did you do with it? - Oh, a dancer? - A voice...! She took me to the cleaners! I was a lyrical impresario. Women were my downfall. Oh my goodness, tell me about it! Ah, yours is a little too pretty. How do you mean? Mind you, if I could do it over again, I'd go for calmer ones, girls with inner beauty. You find her pretty, my Rose, huh? A one-way plane ticket, my friend! One without a stopover! A rocket! Ten thousand five hundred! That would make our Lum an executive! Senior executive. His dream! What did you do in your free time? The road, Sebaz! Keep your eyes on the road! In fact, about Solange, you were right. It's Sulser she's after! You can say what you like! I can't hear a word in this helmet! So just drive straight and stop looking back! Not too much water. Something savory? No, not too savory, maybe a little cheese. No, I didn't put my date of birth. What sign are you? Capricorn. - Maybe it will stop. - It's always the same! It had to rain on the Saturday. Hey! Fabre! There's no use getting cross, either. Fabre! So! There you are! Change of plan, my friends, we'll eat in the dining room! What will we eat, sir? You saw the mutton. It'll be dry tomorrow. Just tell Jasmina to do it for lunch... maybe in a stew. - But tonight? - I love a stew. What about this evening? Who asked you to lend a hand, Vezir. There are almost twenty-five of us, so we have fifty arms! Well, if that's how it is, make do with forty-eight! If you're going to be rude, I'm off to bed! Ouch! Oh! Now I'm crippled! I'll end up crippled! Careful Solange, don't slip! Vezir! Come here! Stay with us, Joseph! - No! - What? Go back and shake Ponte's hand! Right now. Go on! I apologize, it's... - Oh, it's nothing, forget it. - There you go. Now kiss and make up! There we are. Very good. No frills, huh? We didn't finish the sandwiches that were for lunch! Desserts are like music halls! When it's good, there's an encore! There we go! Do you want me to get you anything? Would you get me a sweater? What about a little poker? They won't want to play poker, darling. Ah, just a little game of poker, a very short and cheap game, 100 francs a chip. Yes, why not, let's start with that. Just set up a Monopoly table next door for the... The wet blankets! Do you really want to play poker? What's wrong? It's just a little game! One. - No! Two. - Give me three. Seven hundred. Wow, seven hundred, he says. Seven hundred, the point I'm at... Five. One, two, three, four, five. Rue de Belleville. Ah no, I'll not buy that one. Four and three, seven. - I'll buy it! - He's buying it. La rue de la Paix costs fifty thousand francs, Sebaz. Ah, I'm sorry but that's not within your means. Here, take that, too! But you can't play like that! That's not in the rules! But I want La Rue de la Paix, I need it, dammit! Here you go, I'm the company's main courier, I do what I like, no 17-year-old brat can... Hey! I would appreciate you not calling my daughter a brat! Unbelievable. How rude! I don't want your money! Mr. Sulser wouldn't do such a thing! No, forgive him Mrs. Joeuf, you too, he doesn't know what he's saying. It's true. Our friend Sebaz is a primitive being, he has not studied anything, he's made no intellectual effort, ever. But hey, he's very honest and he's a loyal courier. So please, I beg you to forgive him, you must forgive him. Well, I'm not playing anymore. Mrs. Joeuf! So... It's a real shame, it's gotten so late, all the programs will have finished, we could have watched some TV. There's Dad's VCR, if you want... These are good films, but I've seen them all, they've been on TV. Is that so? And the taxi guy? You mean my godfather? My dad likes him, you know. Is that so? It's like Odile, we've not seen her all evening. - Blanpain... - What do you mean, Blanpain? Ah, you're still here? Nine thousand, he took from me! Yes, he got completely crazy! - Joeuf? - Yes, Joeuf. He plays in circles... it's all coming back to me, now! Was he playing on two tables? Oh no, you know at this hour, there's only one table left. But he's just relentless, he raises every time all-in, too! So he raises against all we have. Is it still going? Well, Lenoir asked to keep going. What do you expect him to do? He's 11,000 in the red! But you stopped, didn't you, Mr. Calot? Well yes, he already took July off me, I want to keep Christmas! - Mr. Calot? - Yes? Want me to sub you? Well, how much do you have on you? Six. My word, it's not stolen is it? No! Oh well, I wouldn't say no. I'll take that and that. Ah, Lum... - Did you talk to him last night? - Who? To the head-chopper, the octopus! But I saw you go into his office together, after the cake. I have eyes everywhere! - Shh. - Oh yes. You wouldn't think so, but I have eyes everywhere. What did he tell you? Nothing, Mr. Calot, nothing bad. Oh, why? Is Joeuf the kind of guy to say anything good? Ah! That's a new one. Ah, Lum... in fact, someone is waiting for you downstairs! Three queens. Full house, ten. Aces. I know, my dear Jean-Ba, I know. But with the storm... What happened to you, Mr. Demaret? He took it all off! His tie, his shirt, his jacket! Bam bam bam! Why sit on the floor, you'll catch cold! It's Joeuf... Sulser, the ash! Oh yes! He doesn't accept backdated checks. So? Well, Mr. Demaret has to wait until the game is over. Are you winning, at least? Enough to get to the hotel. - We'll do as we said. - Yes. - However late it gets! - Yes! One hundred! Plus another hundred, my dears. Am I disturbing you? No. As long as you keep your mouth shut. Another hundred. Five hundred. All in. I'll pass. Another five. Flush! That'll teach you to want to police us, my dear Vezir. - Has your godfather left? - Oh yes. It's funny, isn't it? Being afraid of a storm, like that. Oh yes. Here, take my watch, is that OK? Listen, I've got no more cash and I didn't bring my checkbook. Yes, it's very nice. One thousand francs, Lenoir. Take it or leave it. It's worth way more than that! Well, I'm not a jeweler, old boy! OK. One thousand francs it is, then. Sulser, give him a stack and one thousand francs in chips. Five thousand. Whose turn is it? We're falling asleep here! It's your turn, Mr. Joeuf, if I may. Could Lum leave, at least? I was about to go, anyway. No worries. - Are you OK? - I need the doctor. - I so sorry. I really am... - Don't worry. It's nothing. Take this, you bunch of snobs! Take this! I'll get you all! - Leaving already? - Yes, it's getting late. - How are you getting back? - That's not important. Of course it is! - Hold onto me. - What? Hold onto me! You can hold me tighter, you know. What a surprise! - Shall we go up for a nightcap? - Oh yes! You don't put your lock on? Because... Lum, do you really think we came up for a drink? No, of course not, but... I figured that it would be a good place to start, with a drink. She hasn't had many lovers, you know? How many, sweetie? Oh, I beg your pardon... - We feel right at home here... - Yeah... It's just, the curtains are a little funny... Ah, you think so, too? Are you happy we're here, then? - We can be informal. - You think? - Do you have a bathroom? - Yes, in there. You promised to wake me! Where's their mom? Hey, it's the taxi guy! - My name is José! - He's my godfather! Do you want the window open? Oh no, it's fine! Jean-Ba, where's their mom? Godfather, could you leave us? No, we'll go. Yes. - No goodbye kiss? - You must be joking! Kisses with tongue? Lots! You can't imagine... Hey, Mr. Lum! I wanted to thank you for last night, the Monopoly game, without you... Yes, without me, you'd be a courier for another firm, or unemployed... Could you give me another ride today? Why? Is your godfather coming, too? Yes, he managed to free himself for lunch. You don't think he's cheating, do you? Oh, Mrs. Ciré, I don't think anything anymore. It's down to how you play, and your means, but it's mostly down to luck. And he's a lucky devil! Have you seen these? Oh my! I didn't do too badly, huh? Look at Lenoir's face! It looks good on me, huh? How cute you were, all blond curls. You were right to bring him, Lum. Why? Is it happening soon? Is what happening soon? Want to spoil it? What if they heard you? José, may I call you that? - Yes. - José, you don't mind? José, I'm counting on you to keep him calm. Where is it? It's in there. Hey! Just a minute! Yes, yes! OK! I've finished. That'll teach you to play with the big boys. Excuse me, sir. They wanted to play with Joeuf, but didn't know how much it'd cost them! Are you OK, Blanpain? You got a good appetite there! - It's very good, yes! Thank you. - Oh yes, so good. - Say, Blanpain. - Yes? The manager at the Bellevue, do you know who insures him? No. For broken beds. Ha! For sordid affairs, stains... We do, Blanpain, oh yes! Lum even drew up the contract. Right, Lum? Yes, I did. My friends! Let's not part like this, without one more game. I delayed this moment for as long as possible, but the clock is ticking, not for you, Lenoir, but it is ticking anyway! I don't want to send you back to your wives and children too late. So let's get on with it. Those whose monthly salary exceeds 7,000, francs please raise your hand. Quickly, please! Come now, there's no shame in it! Are you forgetting yourself, Sulser? Should I tell your team how much you cost us? Rose, my darling, Odile, Nathalie, please leave us now. So, ladies and gentlemen... I obey my husband. We shall probably not see each other again. Another time, I hope. Goodbye, Mrs. Joeuf. Can't I stay, daddy? You promised. Go to your room! Join your mother and sister. And no-one at the windows, either! So, let me explain the rules of the game. There's no fun in this, believe me. But I have to part with four of you. Oh yes, the good results are just a façade. The company is in crisis, temporary I hope, but painful nonetheless. I pay you too well, ladies and gentlemen! Yes, salaries have gone up, up, up! Not my fault, not yours either, before you say anything! In any case, I lack the courage to brutally choose four victims. So I decided to do it as a game. Musical chairs, I guess everyone knows how to play? You know, we walk around a table and, at the referee's signal, I'll be the referee this time, Lenoir, at the referee's signal, everyone stops. Then all you have to do is sit down. However, for eight players, for example, there are only seven chairs around the table, you get the idea? For seven, six; for six, five. And so on. The one left standing loses his place at the table and at the company. I can't make it any clearer. The game will end when only five of you are seated. Does everyone understand? We're not cattle, this is monstrous! I, for one, will not indulge in this ridiculous farce! If you want me to resign, I will! Oh, stay in your place, Vezir, would you? You'll play, like everyone else. You have no right. It's not legal! Read your contract again, Arnaud, I have every right! Ah, I forgot one last thing... José! - José! - André? You'll give me a hand, won't you? If you wouldn't mind taking the... ...taking the chairs away? Right. Thank you, José! No, thank you. Come on now, have some guts. You can't back out now, your subordinates are watching. Fabre! The flag, please! You lot can encourage whoever you like, that's the game. Now, give me that. On your marks! Set! Go! Come on! - Come on, Mr. Calot! - Go! Come on! Wait a minute! That's it! That's what it's all about! See? It's not rocket science! What? Ah, you disgust me, Demaret. You're fired! Be a good sport, at least! As head bookkeeper, you'll calculate your own severance pay. He'll be due for at least forty thousand. Should I? I'll just put it over here. Come on now, don't get soft, second round! - It's not so bad... - Come on! Come on! Suzette! Suzette! Hey, don't touch me! No! Yes, I just did that! Yes, I did! I am a woman, you can't do this to me! Miss, you're dismissed! Is that better? I have to admit, that makes me laugh. I am entitled to a little respect. Some decency. Take the chair, if you like, as a souvenir... Come now! - Ah! My dear Jean-Ba! - Come on! Mr. Calot! Your laces are undone! Shit! Thank you. On your marks, go! It's like a dream. Come on! Come on! Move it! Calot! - Calot! - Jean-Ba! There, now that's three! José! Well I'm just delighted. I'm overjoyed! I was sick of your company! Sick of this weekend! Enough of your two little sluts, too! Huh! I said, your two little sluts! I've had it up to here with your games. With that thing of yours, your stupid headphones! It's not even a proper Sony Walkman. And your ass, I've had enough of your fat ass. - And your damn lucky streak! - Fabre! Fabre, please accompany Mr. Lenoir to his car. He is no longer an employee. Right! Time for the final round! Everyone on their feet. Ready? Oh! There we go. They broke it, I'm sure! Ponte's revenge! Oh yeah, look at them rubbing their hands together, gloating! You guys never liked me! Nobody ever liked me. That's not true! It's not true. Well now it's over, huh! I'm the last one, right? Here's a nice end for you. It's terrible. My leg! I can't even feel it anymore. Well, lean on the other one, Vezir, and get out! Can't you tell I've had enough? He's so handsome. Don't you think? I think you should go, too. Don't you think that's enough? Can't you see how tired I am? Besides, we'll speak soon. Back to work tomorrow, back to business! Back to business. Off you go, quickly! There are traffic jams on the freeway. Go, quickly! No-one bother to thank me! Goodbye! That's not mine. - Mr. Calot? - Yes? Can you take my godfather and I back to Paris? Of course. You know, Mr. Calot, I'm very happy to keep you as my manager. I heard your encouragements during the game. It was, I don't know how to put it... Stimulating. That's it. Supportive. In any case, Lum, you know that I am much more than just your boss. Much more than a Joeuf! You see, it's not that easy to be at the top and stay there. We are all mountaineers, my friends... André, I mean Mr. Joeuf, he just planted his little flag first. Little flags are fragile and can blow away. Sometimes, all it takes is a headwind and whoosh! The little flag falls down! Who dares, wins! The world is overflowing with crevices. Let me give you some advice: do what I do... Oh yes, and what do you do? A sleigh ride! André! You scared me! See you tomorrow, Mr. Calot. Until then, my dear Lum, we're still in the game! - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. You're boiling hot. You know, it didn't go so bad. Can you smell that lovely scent? What about the lower salaried? I have to fire three more. Fuck it! However will I do it? We'll find a way. We'll find a way. Subtitle translation by: Emma Sayers
