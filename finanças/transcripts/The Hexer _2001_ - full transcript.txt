Seven years ago, you swore to render to us what you'd find home, unexpected. That was your newborn son. You crazy, tramp? Co-starring Set Decorations and lnteriors Without the proper selection and mutation, we won't get a good hexer. - ls he a hexer? - Yes. - A man too? - Yes. Enough. He'll fight and kill monsters that threaten people. Costume Designer Makeup Edited by Sound You raised your sword against the people. There are proofs. You're cursed a hundred times. Out! Surrender swords. l'll remember and get at you. l'll remember and get at you. l want to be a hexer. Music Production Manager Producers Director of Photography Directed by Mother... My horse! Mother... Not now. Don't spoil my fun. Pavetta! Pavetta! That's the hexer Geralt of Rivia. Needs no reward and claims he's been hunting. - Haughty, isn't he? - A strange kind, hexers. They say... l know who they are, Haxo. Who knows... Send in Mousebag and Vissegerd. What're you doing here? Go to your room. Mother... Hear me, please. l beg you to put off the betrothal and wedding. Pavetta... rulers can't listen to the heart. Cintra needs a male king. We, women, can't rule. The law of the land, this. You can't help it. You bring shame upon me. Why the feast for the suitors? l can't. l don't love him. Not a word from you! Back to your room! l'll come soon. You've promised so many times. Help me! Take her Highness to her room! l'm worried about her. Any progress, Druid? Hers is a pristine force, just revealed. Too much of it. lt'd take years... Her grandma could raise a drawbridge with a tic of her brow. Something haunts the castle at night. You haven't heard? Haxo? lf we mean the same thing and something will happen... l'll post more guards! You've heard of Nilfgaard? A small kingdom in the south. A military clique rules it now, growing in strength. They believe in conquest, sword and blood, and the rule of supermen. To get access to the sea, they conquer neighbors and may be here soon. So we must close ranks, and Pavetta must wed the king's nephew. Hence the feast for the suitors, as the silly custom requires. l see, my lady, but matters of the big world are foreign to me. l know. Stay till the wedding and keep your eyes peeled. Guard Pavetta. One more thing. l heard that a knight called Hedgehog of Erlenwald lays claims to Pavetta's hand. Funny, isn't it? On what grounds? Says my late husband told him something long ago. lf he tries to disturb the celebrations, stop him. How? For good? lt's up to you. l'm no paid killer. Hedgehog has the appearance ... of a monster. Well? To Erlenwald? What are you going to do? On a mission where your power, my lady, does not reach. l mean nothing wrong, just to ask you something. l have no friends to help me. l see by your eyes that yours is a killing mission. l don't know what l'll do. A long way to the castle? You want to talk to our lord? He's away. l'll wait till he returns. lt's me. You've come to kill me? ls that silver? To kill monsters? Yes. Alas you're only human. Show me your face, Duny. Not yet. Scared? You got a face of a monster. Scat, Hedgehog! You know the Right of Surprise. By its virtue Pavetta is mine forever. Go home, blockhead! lt's a right of honor and sacrifice, alien to you. You took advantage of Pavetta's magic to possess her. lt's struck twelve. l'll wear my human face until dawn... and then - a hedgehog snout. Can't that be disenchanted? Not my enchantment. l've tried my entire life. The magi said that only the Right of Surprise can release me through a consummated marriage. Sixteen years ago, King Roegner, Pavetta's father, lost his way while hunting and broke his leg. After l rescued him, he promised to give me what he finds home upon his return. Little did he know that Calanthe was expecting. Roegner told me something on his deathbed, garbled and ambiguous, as if spoken in delirious fever. He'd kept silent for years. Then said some nonsense and upped and died. How was l to take it? May l tell you something in private? Speak. We keep no secrets in this company. Pavetta and Hedgehog cohabited like man and wife. She is not a virgin. That's true! That's true! l wanted to tell you, but you never had time. You've cast me away, like a thing that can be sold to advantage. Any peasant child basks in more feeling and affection. l love him! Leave me alone! You were to kill him. We've been pestered with misfortunes ever since you came! Don't refuse her the right to love. lf the Right of Surprise binds this relationship, it's her fate then. And you can't help it. Fate is inevitable. How do you know? He was taken away from home. He's a Child-Surprise. Noble ladies, honorable lords, You distinguished visitors Let the bard tell a tale of war A history of cruel battles... Green fields over the sea, Where roses are blood red That's where two great armies ln the battle of Chocieburz met. Where's Pavetta, my lady? Lioness Calanthe, Queen of Cintra Leading her army to fight... Distinguished visitors! One should deliver the bad news fast but take one's time relishing the good. Pavetta can't be the queen of your dreams tonight. Matters of importance have forced us to postpone the celebration. Queen Calanthe, however, wants you to stay till the wedding day, no matter when we will celebrate it and who the bridegroom and the bride will be. Duny of Erlenwald called Hedgehog! He is the cause of all our worries! He claims to have better rights to wed Pavetta than anyone of you. We want to honor those rights, to examine them, and pass ourjudgement. Hedgehog claims to have saved King Roegner's life, who promised to give him his daughter's hand in marriage, though she wasn't born yet. Show us your face and sit down with us. l'll remain standing. l've come to claim my rights. l'll show my face after midnight. Then move away, Hedgehog without a face, and don't spoil our fun. Take off your helmet! Not yet. Say, Calanthe, if the king promised to honor the Right of Surprise, which meant Pavetta? lt's her l want! Neither your kingdom nor power! The king's daughter and that pig's snout? Never! - Kill him! - No! - She can't restrain herself! - Let's strike together! l give you Pavetta, Hedgehog of Erlenwald. Let it be. l give you Pavetta. lt dawns and you're still wearing a human face. You released him from his accursed enchantment by saying, ''l give you Pavetta.'' My lady, you've disappointed me. - This is not my world. - You've done so much... ... for us, for me. Please stay. l beg you too. l'll do whatever you wish. - l want nothing. - You can't leave just like that. l know you don't like me, but l must reward you. He can only ask for the Right of Surprise. Leave him alone. Geralt, leave this place, please! Stay! Let's break even and put it behind us. He'll return to claim something. l know his kind. You promised to give me what l desire, right? Yes. You'll give me what you don't know you got. l'll return to see if fate has favored me. l was meaning to tell you. l'll give birth to... a baby. Don't leave the trail of fate, which spells fight, Your sword will not rust but gleam with blood. For you possess the right, Right of Surprise Whoever tries to deny it will be struck down. Leave the saddlebags. They're not yours. - Who says? - None of your business. You're not armed. lt's no good. You're wrong. My weapons follow me. The deal was 200 groschen. l stick out my neck for peanuts and you try to rob me? But we haven't! You've forgotten something. What, sir? You pulled a knife on me when l was unarmed. A fine blow. l'm Borch Three Jackdaws. They're me girls Tea and Vea of Zerrica. Geralt of Rivia. Try to understa l can't have human doubts, but l have my princ l kill aggressive beasts that threaten men and spare those that fear men. They have the right to live as they threaten nobody. That disagrees with men's interests. l don't care about those. Don't you defend them? Men's lives not interests. What don't you kill? lf you insist, l'll tell you. l don't slay dragons. The most dangerous! No, it's quite s Rather than attack people they ran away. Men hunt dragons! But they kill sheep, cows... A dragon's no mouse. lt eats a lot. Since man has cut down forests, killed off game, and left them little space to live, what can they do? You amaze me! That's what gives me trouble. But aren't dragons wonders of nature? They breathe fire, sail the skies, guard treasures only for fun, and aren't vindictive or envious. Why kill them? - They're beautiful. - They think it's a compliment. Be careful! They're tireless as lovers. They like you, dammit. They do, indeed! - What's your name? - Alveaenerle. Pretty. Why can't we pass? My orders. Why, this is a free land. Don't you know it, creep? Leave him alone! We'll ride to Hengfors along the bank. Aren't you chasing the dragon? What dragon are you talking about? Geralt! l'm Yaskier, a bard and poet. Some girls call me peerless. At the break of dawn When the sun rose... - Speak plainly? - Don't l? A dragon landed in the pastures... A dragon because it suits your ballad? l saw it with my own eyes. The local shoemaker had an They gutted a sheep, stuffed it with herbs, sulphur and tar, and put it in the middle of the flock. Little did they hope the dragon would fall for such stinking shit. But it swallowed the bait! Keep talking, Yaskier. First it seemed struck dead! Before long it started to roar, somersault, and breathe smoke. Then it weakened and lay down motionless. Two men came forward to see if it still breathed. We soon buried them under a mound. Was it still alive? And how! lt pulled itself together and flew away. And it disappeared in the gorges of the Kestrel Mts. lt's clear. lt must've been lethargic. The mountains must hide its treasure. Hence the blocked passage. Someone wants to grab the treasure. lt's King Niedamir of Caingorn. Right! He shut out the competition and the Holopolans, who want to slay the dragon too. Hence his mounted soldiers and the call for dragon slayers. - Let's join them. - Because of the loot? - Not necessarily. - The dragon interests you? Some want to kill it, others, like you have their principles. And l see the third way. lf l get it, you want to stop them. Don't you reveal your designs. They'll kill you the first chance they get. To save the dragon, we must kill them. l can't do it or watch it done. l'm sorry. All right. l'll do it alone. Thanks for the warning. The king's set off. We're only waiting for you. Welcome, Yennefer. You've met? Yes... Once. You're a very beautiful lady. Call me Yennefer. l'm a sorceress. We're bound by trade. Your order, officer... are for the mob and the riffraff, not us noblemen and knights. l can let pass only those who can kill the reptile. You know this? Are you a hexer? Yennefer... You've come here because of the dragon? The same old story? The same old story in every respect. No, Geralt, we weren't meant for each other. l couldn't tie myself to someone who leaves at night and you never know where he returns from. Why, itjust as it was. You're like a tumbleweed. Yesterday, you killed a basilisk and today you're off God knows where and why. A hexer, you're aimless, because you can't have an aim. Only to kill another monster. That's the way l was made. And what's your aim? Why are you here? Don't you remember? Ever a dreamer, l want to bear a child, but l can't. l've heard of possible Extracts from dragon's tissue. What's the buzz in high places? Everyone blathers about his calling. Niedamir wants to take over a principality. Eyck to defend damsels from dragons. And Yennefer? Let's forget it, Borch. lt's over and done with. What happened? l'll go and see. - Stay! - Why? Stay! - Yennefer! - Here! - Yennefer! - Here! - Cast a spell, dammit! - How? Hanging? Can't you find a foothold? Can't you do something with your legs? - Only wag them. - Chin up! Hang in there! - Give me some rope! - l can't any longer! Fetch some rope! Else they both fall down! Maybe they should. - Save yourself! - No, hang on! Geralt, l can't love! Forgive me! - Farewell, Yaskier! - Where's Borch? You were together. Folks! Noble knights! A huge dragon! - Where? - Behind the gorge! On the plain! How beautiful. Gentlemen, let's attack! That's not the one we're after. The other, poisoned, must be in a cave guarding treasure. Makes no difference. We'll get more for his skin. Let's move! Dragon... You're beautiful. Leave it in peace, please. You don't kill a legend. Geralt, Yennefer! Talk them out of it. Why run a risk? Let's stuff an animal with poison and toss it to him. Out with you, cobbler! Every fool knows it's a magic dragon. Heed the poet's words. Run away! And you're staying? l'm Villentretenmerth. The avalanche failed to stop you. The road north is closed. Go away! lt's talking! You bad dragon who oppress mankind, Can you challenge on beaten ground me, Eyck of Denesle, to fight to the death? Come out! Kill it for me, please. lt'll be like it was between us. You told me the truth over the abyss. You want to buy me like a piece of meat. No! Theirs is a world of nature. Let's leave it in peace. The man's world is for our kind and huge enough at that. That dragon's asking for peace. lt could burn us, but doesn't want to. lt's giving us an important message. Let's leave this place. - We're returning to Caingorn. - But, sir... Not a word! Lady Yennefer and you gentlemen, l bid you farewell. Thanks, Geralt, for the true words l've been had by fools. Yennefer, a new a half of its skin and the treasure. The dragon's mine. Greed has deprived you of your senses. Better any monster than you. Yaskier, come! - Who do you side with? - Not against you. Then trust me, please. Let's get at the reptile! Take it alive! Leave it alone! Kill the reptile! Leave it. lt's just a cub. Enough of this! lt's a cub of the dragon the Holopolans poisoned. We're left alone, you and me a dragon's cub and a poet. That's certainly an omen, but l wonder what it spells. Tell me, Borch, for he never will. Or else l won't make up a ballad. Some creatures you call monsters feel endangered by men. They won't survive without a defender, like a hexer. l sometimes play the part. lt's too beautiful to sing about. So l won't. Why don't you ask me for something, Geralt? l can do a lot. Almost everything. - Can you mind read? - l can. No, it's impossible. l can mind read too. Though your heart's on fire She's not meant for you, darling. That's how the fire ends, Quenched by the ocean of parting. By the ocean of parting. Which of them is Calanthe's grandson? l can't talk about it. Careful with the queen. Pavetta and Hedgehog perished at sea. The child's the only heir to the family that's left. Don't take away the only child, the successor to the throne! You can't claim him. lt's inhuman! See how my pride has been punished? l've lost everything. Boys're playing down in the moat. Take your pick. Anyone! All of them! Be human for once! None of those kids can make a hexer. Pavetta's son is not among them. Don't you know that... Shut up! Not a word from you! Pavetta's son is not at the court. And l'm not taking another kid. Don't say a word, please. Understand? Yes... l don't even know how to thank you. What if fate is not a myth. Can it have revenge? l don't know. But it's me who challenges it. Don't worry. l'm leaving for far-off lands. For long. Maybe forever. Tonight you won't see the stars Cause Cintra will be burning And will show a world that will perish. Like a flock of black ravens The enemies are hurrying You've entered but your fate will find you. After the demise of Cintra and Queen Calanthe's death, the Emperor sent his governor who introduced a new order. Whereupon the barons mutinied. Not long ago you claimed they were fighting for freedom. As rumors lingered of Queen's granddaughter's survival, the Emperor ordered an investigation. The rumors may be true. - You sure of the news? - The Emperor is worried. lf the barons catch the child, this will spell war. All tribes of elves and dwarves will join them. They believe that in the girl's veins flows the holy blood of their ancestors. l see. The Emperor wants her in Nilfgaard as soon as possible. l don't understand. You may indulge in conjectures. The Emperor has a wife... but is childless. Exactly! This, Count, is... politics. A fantastic plan! How do we realize it? Those are territories with temples, fanes, and Melitele, the shrine of the earth cult, whose Priestess Nenneke is above the law and shelters getaways under a cloak of compassion! l deem that your intelligence and the character of the mission will prompt your action. The girl must be found. Mother... He must've recognized you. He's unconscious. A hexer, he has no mother. l thought he's a man. Looks the same but the white hair. He is human. He had parents. Small children were carried away and changed into hexers. The mothers surrendered them? Oh, Ciri, l'll tell you later. Fetch bandages. l wonder if he will survive. You must help him. Ciri, come with me! Calm down, sleep... You hear me? Do you understand? At long last. l had to open your wounds and heal you anew. Who hacked you down so? A bunch of vampires? lt was in the marsh, mother. l was too slow. Thank you. Thank the others too. lt was ajoint effort. You have a body of iron. Now you'll recover soon. Who was that little girl? Ciri? An orphan like many of them here. We shelter them in these dangerous times. She's gone through a lot, so don't be harsh with her. Only you know that the Order won't ever have such a chance. We may build our own principality some day. We need a monster in human body, who wreaks havoc and death, knows no mercy but only hatred. A woman prowls the Sodden Mountains, Dzierzba by name, as she impales people. Said to be driven by demons and tainted by the black sun. They also say she's Renfri, Princess of Creyden. As a child, she ran away from the court, only to join the Seven Gnomes of Mahakam. They rob merchants. She's suspected of monstrous crimes. She has no mercy. Bring her here. l've released you from your vows of silence. Yet you're holding back something. lt's so bad? Tell me! l saw rack and ruin... fire... and death. Where? Here. l don't believe it. Come, let's pray. My lady, something binds them, Geralt and Ciri. l know what, but he doesn't. Don't tell him anything. Ciri must leave as soon as possible. Don't neglect it, please! l'm not. l've sent a letter to the prince and am waiting. Don't be scared of humans. l'm one too. Just like you. Come! l like you Geralt. l'm Falwick, Count of Moen. And this is Tailles of Dorndal. We've been waiting for you. You noble knights of the Order of White Rose are at the service of our lord, Prince Hereward. Your chapter tries to solicit him for lands. Thanks for your care. We've just received them. Our sovereign lord has sent us to inspect the temple. We hear of elves and nonhuman creatures sheltered here. The hexer must leave the temple too. You want to disgrace the oldest cult in these parts? A military inspection? There's no war here. The Prince couldn't have given such an order. How dare you give a lie to Prince's orders? Tailles! Don't you think that the presence of the hexer here is out of the ordinary? What's he doing here? Praying? The hexer Geralt has been a friend of the temple for long. He's recovering from heavy wounds. All right, Falwick. l promise to leave these parts in three days. You'll leave at once! And we'll inspect this place. l really don't like you. You threaten the woman and me because l'm unarmed. Don't threaten for you'll be scared yourself. lf he draws his word, l'll hit him in the face like the boor he is. Your blood will wash this insult. l'm waiting outside the gate. You dropped something, son. Pick it up. Don't trash this place. Take this fool out of here for you'll have trouble. l'll write the Prince. Out with you now. Take her to Brokilon and hide her. That's where the Emperor will not find her. lf he's looking for her at all. Geralt! Why didn't you tell me... Ciri is Calanthe's granddaughter? Would it have make any difference? Yes. l'd have left long ago. like l swore. l wasn't allowed to meet her. Because of me revenge struck Calanthe and Ciri. - How proud you are! - What do you want? Decide at last! lf you want to be a man, be one! You know what that means? l used to kill people but only in self defense. Now l'll have to... Yes. lf necessary... lf the cause is right. All right. l'll carry her away come morning. Not yet. You'll carry a letter. We must be sure she'll be welcome and hidden away. Ciri? - What're you doing here? - l want to come along. Does Mother know? No. lola said you must take me away, as time's running out. She's a prophetess. Am l to kidnap you? l saw my granny die, Cintra burn, and the things they did there. l'm scared. lola doesn't lie. Geralt, take me away! - Let's tell Nenneke. - No, she won't let me. You must decide. l'm the child of your destiny. lola said so. Good. No. - l want to take her now. - No. What if... lola is right? Some gangs came to Ellander. lt's dangerous. She'll be safe with me. No. You decide. Dammit! You've finally got from under the priestess's skirts. You insulted Tailles, who dared you to fight. Fight. Do l have to? You must answer the challenge. l have to blindfold you. To even his chances, you butcher. So he can kill me with impunity. And if l touch him, l'll swing, right? Where's your honor? Where's that knight? Left without goodbye? l'll let them tie me up or we won't find each other. Get him! Hold it! Tailles got in the way of his own sword. Bad luck. You monkeys are all alike. You'll swing, Cranmer! l promise. And you'll regret it. l swear. Now you fight. l dare you. l won't. You're not worth it. Worth or not, l can gut you like a hog. You won't make it, Cranmer. Tell me, worm, why did you want Tailles killed? You know the hexer's trade. He didn't stand a chance, like you, Gwidon. Who are you? Don't you know the kid that passed the test of the hills that you wanted to kill? That's... you. l can kill you, turncoat that you are. You used to kill too. You're a turncoat too, Geralt. The temple's under my care. Open up! Remember, you'll be Queen of Cintra. Yours the same holy blood as Calanthe's. So you must act like a queen, not like a child. Open up! Open the gate! - Let them say what they want first. - Anyone may enter here. Prince heard by the grapevine that Princess Cirilla of Cintra is hiding here. Under the circumstances Prince'd like to take her under his care. You have his letter? She's here, right? She perished during the siege. Everybody knows that. Enough! Where's Ciri? lt's Prince's order. You lie, Count. End of conversation! You leave me no choice. ls Princess Cirilla of Cintra here? lf so, l must take her away. l'll stop at... nothing. They'll all die, and you'll be watching it. Will you have it on your conscience?! Who are you? She's our prophetess. So you know the truth. l see your future and that of Renfri. You'll all die in a month. Spare us. There's still time. You can change your fate. You know yours? l'll die today and you, soon after me. You're right. You'll die today. Tell me then. Leave her alone! Leave her l said. Call your men and let's go. What're you doing? l know. l have no choice. l wouldn't live with it. Pray for me. Tomorrow everyone will kings, princes, barons of Cintra, They'll know you've carried her away. And they'll take up arms, all against you! No one will know. What have l done? What have l done? Run away! Run away! Run away! No one! Understand? No one. - Where to? - To the headman. l killed it near the town. Leave that carcass! lt's been so long! - l thought you'd perished. - lt's not so easy. Look how low l've fallen. l, the greatest bard of these parts, sing in Blaviken! No one here understands poetry. All they think of is cabbage and pig's head! Go somewhere else. lt's snow out there. The passes are snowbound. And l must go south to Yspaden. lt smelled of autumn then, The sense was blown with the wind. The diamonds at the end of your lashes Cannot now change a thing. l can't pay you for the monster. l've run out of funds completely. - People were killed out there. - That's right. And what of it? How was it? Easy. The beast was sated and sluggish. You're the last of your kind. And you're a good man. lt's my duty. - That's all. - Time to go. Thanks for the meal. Time for me too. Everyone seems crazy or what? They burn fanes and temples. An armed group is coming here. - Which temples? - Those you've come from. Which? Tell me. Please! Go to Magus Stregobor. He's sent the news. My good man, go away! l'm no good man, but a hexer with business to do. Who are you? Geralt of Rivia, of the Wolves. They call me White Wolf. l know Geralt. Are you him? Tell me the three runes on the cliff of Kaer Morhen. That l can never tell to anybody. But all have the same ending. l know who you are. l've recognized your voice. - Welcome, hexer! - Like l thought, Stregobor! - Relax. Forget the evil world. - ls that all illusion? Yes. Sit down. ls that illusion too? What brings you here? l've come from the Temple of Melitele. lt was threatened, but l didn't sense it. l don't know what happened after l left. Can you still bring back images? That all depends on you. l've been two years in the tower. l never leave it. You guessed right. - And your abilities, magic? - Don't work any more. She's impervious to them. - Who? - Renfri of Creyden. She's found me here! Tomorrow or the day after, she'll try to kill me. l've seen the black sun in the crystal ball. She's coming near... She's in town. That's her. l know the story. She was to be killed, but she survived. Now she's following you to have revenge. That's normal. You asked if l can bring back images? What happened there? She's here! Has an aura or... Help me! You want to sic me on her by intriguing! Say it straight. Someone's life is at stake! So is mine! Help me. l'll do whatever you want. l'm mixed up! Wait! They are connected... Renfri and Ciri. l wonder how. Renfri is in town. l may've been wrong about others, but she's a monster. Kill her! Tell me more. What connects them? Come in the morning. l'll know more. That's your price - a deal. l'm no paid killer. Rather than kill people l defend them! Defend me then! Good. lf Renfri attacks you, l'll defend you. Only then. Will you tell me now? Come at dawn. What are they? Six armed men in the prince's service. No more booze, stinkers! Gentlemen, leave her alone! Help me, sir! What's that creep? A white ape! Let her go and get out! l'm waiting for Renfri. Enough. l want to be alone. You've seen the magus. Don't get mix with that. l've come for him. The prince's order. l'll take him dead or alive. Leave him in peace. l need him and so does the town. l'm warning you. Keep away from us and whatever we do. l won't argue. Spare him. Don't interfere with the law. Better go back to your monsters where you belong. There are various monsters judging by the sight of you. l'm no monster and you're no human. Careful then. l'm warning you. l won't watch your evildoing in peace. Kitty, kitty... l don't like you either. Just kidding. But l'm not. Pull your sword! l'm lvo Mirce, sword master. Called Chicadee. l've always wanted to test you, hexer. How much bull do they spread about you. Fight! Beat it! l don't fight slobs. Like l thought, you coward. Want me to spit on you? Go ahead! Sword master! Sword master... He's here! Freeze, hexer! Where's Renfri? At the tower, making the magus an offer. You've made your choice. You sure it's the right one? You won't murder people here. l'd get away with it. Stregobor laughed me off. He won't leave the tower even if l slaughter all of Blaviken. Why are you staring so? Yes, l deceived you. Why shouldn't l? Leave this place, Renfri. No, it's your choice. lt's my turn. Nothing doing, Whitehaired. lt doesn't work on me. Go away! lf we cross swords... l know. l can't otherwise. We are what we are. You and me. Don't go, Geralt. l'm cold... embrace me... Master Stregobor can't see you, my good man. He can't see you. lt's me, Geralt! l saw everything in the crystal ball. l want no truck with this, Geralt. That thing stinks. You're worse than Renfri. She was mad with hatred, but had dignity and courage. You don't get it. She burned the Temple of Melitele. No point returning there. What about Nenneke? Ciri? You promised! Ciri's alive. Only she. Go on your way. l won't say anything more. Where is she?! Where is she?! Yaskier, l killed them and have no regrets. l'd kill them again. They burned Melitele and murdered everybody. l don't know what happened to Ciri. l don't know a thing. They say hexers don't feel. And l stuck by several people and they're dead. Why? Snow whitens the place you live in The lakes and marshes gleam icebound That's it, you can't change a thing Your eyes are full of longing. Spring will be back with rains The sun weary hearts will warm They're doing a slow burn Burning with the fire of hope. Geralt! l'm half-dead! l give up. We've arrived. Go alone. You don't need me. Water! Take care of him. Don't heap reproaches on yourself. l don't believe Ciri's dead. Stregobor said she was alive and l'd find her here. Stregobor's a liar. What exactly did he say? To go to Brokilon, where Nenneke had told me. Why should he have lied to me? She's not here. Try the elves' camp. They have some refugees from Ellander. Ask them. l was lurking by the roadside and saw them return right after the fire. They had no packhorses. All the priestesses were lying in the courtyard. They tortured them... before they killed them. And Ciri? Was she there? l don't remember. They were the worst scum l'd ever seen. A woman was leading them! They're already dead. She and six of them. l was a guest in the temple. l never saw you, though. l carried messages to Mother Nenneke. How did you get the scar? lt's not from a sword. They cut me, as l couldn't step aside in time. Knights of the White Rose, dammit, were galloping from the temple as if death had been chasing them. - When was that? - Then. l was approaching the temple. When l came to, l saw smoke. Wait... l know now. First the knights of the Order came. When we arrived at Ellander, the temple was already in flames. None of the priestesses survived the attack and fire. lt is not known who committed the crime. An armed group of people of mixed blood had been spotted there the day before. Many of them were elves. One Geralt of Rivia, hexer, used to hang around the temple... probably a turncoat. lf we don't return to Nilfgaard... This is our last stop. We don't ride any further. l wonder what the Emperor will do if we return without the girl. Falwick guaranteed... bastard! Tomorrow... is the last meeting ... in the bathhouse. You can't always win! But it's a gold mine! lt's scary in a big town. lt's forbidden. Maybe there's a camp or an inn nearby? Everything's deserted now. There're some merchants and knights on the way to Novigrad. Been staying there a week. l don't advise you, though. You won't win. Who are you? A famous poet and troubadour. You want to hear? What a visitor! With so much noise and uproar. Welcome, welcome... Who are you? Maybe someone important. You may be waiting for me or not. Secret service requires passwords and responses. You say them if you know them. l fuck your passwords and responses. They made sense where you didn't reach. l've come to take a bath and will tell my master what you've been doing. You'll all swing, Falwick and you. And now out! Why so nervous, sir? l'm just a messenger. We were waiting here because the Order wants... how shall l put it... to agree on questions that have come up. Just between you and me. That's what l thought. You keep a girl here, right? Yes. Safe and sound. l can't change the conditions the Emperor approved. So l'm taking her away. You'll help me. You won't regret it. Where is she? Outside town, quite close. l accepted your proposition. What's my payoff? Why didn't Falwick wait for me? He must've missed you. He left for you in the morning. Hexer! That's your payoff! On the road to Novigrad There are many knights They may tell something Ere they go into the night... Who are you? Of the Emperor. You must follow me along with the wagons and the load. Falwick told us to wait for you. The count is in our camp. ln bad shape. Get moving! You got a password from him? Yes, we got Falwick. That's the best password. He told you to hurry. Get the children! Setting off? Why so fast? An Emperor's man here says Falwick has told us to join them. l know you! Get him! Geralt! l'm here! Geralt! Let's run! - Can you handle horses? - Sure. We come from a village. l must hide you in a safe place. l want to go home. Was there a girl with you, a little like her? Yes. They kept her separately. Her face was covered. Anybody there? Ciri? A great knight! A secret! l know nothing more. Bring the bard! l've been beaten by ladies, but never by horned knights. Must be an accident. Waste of time, Baron! Someone's crossed our plans. Let's go! Where did they go? Why did you kill Renfri and Chicadee? l promised to kill you if you harm the Melitele priestesses. All of them died. So will you tonight. l'll die? You fool! You're a fool, Falwick. You've betrayed everybody, even your own men! You didn't surprise me. l was waiting for you. Wait! Why did you call him traitor? - You've been had too. - How do you know? Chicadees sing before death. The 'precious shipment' is too cheap. The Emperor will pay more. Wait l say? Hold it! What shipment? A girl. What did the man say in the bathhouse? That Falwick wanted a higher price for her. Lies! Didn't l come to your camp? She was here. They've kidnapped her! No, she wasn't here. Somebody's telling the truth and somebody's lying. May God judge this. Untie him! Not a word, Count! What do you mean, Baron? Who do you believe? That's the snag, Count. Fight, gentlemen! A mistake. l think l know where Ciri's hidden. Let's talk. What? So the hexer was right. No, lt wasn't that way at all. Call off the fight. Too late. May God judge this. Take all your men. Makes no difference. No blindfold? No. l'll snatch theirs. You three will die first. Falwick - on order. - l won't fight with you. - Where's the girl? l don't know. When l left, l ordered her hidden in case of danger. Must be somewhere here. ln the inn's basement? Put up a fight! l told you - a coward and a traitor. Hold it! He was hanging around the walls. Sobered up? Yes, sir, the blissful state is just taking leave of me. So l wonder if you could spare a drop from your vaults your fertile vineyard... Not a word more. l wonder how you'll receive this terrible news l, the most famous bard of the borderlands, have been chased out of town. And called a trickster! Tie him up and quench his thirst! Why? Let me! You were looking for Ciri. Raise your head! Who's carried her away? You won't say? Just like l thought. Well, my mission is accomplished. Case closed. You killed the traitor Falwick, and l'll kill you. lmpale them come morning! - This is dull! - Keep sawing! - What now? - Fire!... There's no way out! Calm down and think! Ciri was here. lt was dark and she couldn't see anything. She must've touched and pulled something... Bend down and touch everything at this level! We'll suffocate! Quick! lt may close! ''What is it that l done wrong?'' You keep asking yourself, You want to cheat your fate And for that you have to pay. Your fate is sealed, my lad, Your sweat's to no avail, Like a stone tossed to the sky, Which wants to be a star. l'm looking for a girl. Fair-haired, she has a small face. Sorry, brother. We don't have such. Ashamed of yourself you are. No matter how you try There is no way to escape love Surrender to love. You'll find her when you do everything right. When your heart is pure... What should l do? Free yourself of the past once for all. Come out, man! l won't harm you! You were traveling alone? With servants, sir, but the scum ran away. lt's high time for you to run too! And the wagon? My possessions? A whole year's work? l got children. You don't seem to know where you've ended up. Here lie such as you who took a short cut. Help me, sir. You're a hexer. l'll give you what you wish. Easy come, indeed... Pardon? Good. You'll give me what you'll find home unexpected on your return. Promise? Yes, sir. Run outside! Now! Sir... You have a high fever! Drink! Where're we heading? Where some folks live. You're losing blood. You'll find a green bottle in the saddlebag. Pour me half a glass. But careful! lt's poison. Where are we? The Jaruga River is near. These are my parts... What's wrong? Right behind those trees! My Zlotolitka and two sons. lt's been a whole year! On the bridge, l promised to let you take away my son, right? No, l'm taking away nobody. But l promised. l don't want anything. Who's that? Looks awesome! A friend. He saved my life. l'll tell you later. Where're the children? They'll be right here. The three of them. Three? l adopted a girl. From the druids who saved orphans after the war. You'll love her. Don't be angry! Daddy! Daddy! You've found me! l knew it! l knew it! l waited... We'll be together now, right? Forever! Don't leave me, Geralt, please! Ciri... Like they l'm your destiny, right? Right? You are... You're much more. THE END Cast of Characters in order of appearance
