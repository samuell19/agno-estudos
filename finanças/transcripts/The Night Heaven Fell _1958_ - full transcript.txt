- Miss Ursula Desfontaines? - Yes? The car is here. My aunt isn't here? No, Miss. She was detained at the house. - And my uncle? - He is taking his nap. - At least the ear is here. - Yes, miss. THE NIGHT HEAVEN FELL People who were chased by the police on the roads called themselves "moonlight robbers". Your poor sister has killed herself. No, don't go there! I beg of you. I've been shamed enough! Don't let him go! Get off, Lamberto. If I bring you to the estate, I lose my job. Too bad for you. Stop, do you hear me? That's enough! Slow down! Get off, Lamberto. Treat it mornings and evenings. In a week it'll be fine. Excuse me, just a moment! Ursula! Who let you in? Get out! My sister killed herself last night. Alfonso! Alfonso! No, no! Alfonso... Lay him on a bed and call a doctor. Carlos, help me. You see, everything was ready to welcome you. Augusta! Another bottle of champagne! My poor Ursula, you've chosen a bad clay to arrive. Obviously this is a bit different than the convent... Some music, to sweeten the change. Will you be moping the whole afternoon? Are you listening? Alfonso! Saddle my horse. Dirty old man! - It's your uncle, Ursula. - You can't stand him either. When they just started and your husband was down, you smiled. Shut up! You don't know what you're saying! If that's for me, I hate champagne. Who is that boy your husband beat to a pulp? - His mother owns the village inn. - You know him? Not personally. His family was ruined by the revolution and he left the country. He's just come back. Was the girl who was found in the well his sister? - I don't know. - He told your husband, no? I told you I don't know. There's no answer at the doctor's. Then the boy will be taken home. Get the driver. It'll be alright now. Come here for a moment, please. Don't worry, horsey. Do you think he can be moved? I think he has a broken collar bone. But it's his leg that worries me. His knee is dislocated. I think I can reset it. Go to your room. I'll join you later. Try to hold him down. I can't do this otherwise. The wounds are only superficial, but the doctor must be told. He's a strong stud. Ursula, what are you doing? Getting settled. The vet thinks it's nothing serious. Hand me the nails, please. Thanks. Do you believe in love at first sight? What do you mean? See a man twice for 5 minutes and fall madly in love? No. - But that's what happened to me. - Don't be ridiculous! I'm not ridiculous, I'm in love! You don't know what love is. You are a child The later you find out, the better for you. You used to be more fun. Remember Biarritz? All the boys courted you. You really had your way with them. I was still as flat as a fish and I admired you. Don't laugh. I could have really hurt myself. That'll teach you to laugh at other people's pain. Easy, Miguel! The chase is over. Hello, Senora Concha. Pour me a cognac. - How are things? - l'll be fine for the fiesta. That's what the doctor said. Another one. Tell me what happened the other day with Senior Esteban. Nothing. We fought. One of us had to win. I lost, and that's it. Forget it. I came here for a different reason. I need to know what you were doing abroad these past years. Let's see... You went to France in 1945, right? What the devil is the matter? What a state! You weren't here when your father died. Why? I was in disciplinary detention. I know. For insulting your superior, right? Hold him for a second, he's pissed all over me. Afterwards... Everyone knows you worked on a ship. - As a mechanic. - As what? - A mechanic. - Be quiet! - On which ship? - What? Write it down yourself. I can't hear you like this. Damn it! Don't cry. Come on. Enrico, don't cry! No! Let go! Leave me alone! You're sick, old man! You can be sure I'll tell Florentine everything! Dirty old man! Shame on you! Trying to exploit your niece! I wondered what a satyr looked like, I've got one in the family. My aunt's husband, no less! She loves you. I even forget you're my guardian. Some guardian! Are you listening? Lamberto should have killed you the other day! But he will! Little bitch! I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget! Stop! You'll make me fall down! - Good afternoon, Count! - Good afternoon, Father! Good evening, Father. I've been playing lost eat. Lost cat? - Could I ride home with you? - Certainly, my child. By the way, father, does the Count confess often? Did you interrogate Lamberto? We already have. His past isn't all that clear. - I thought so. - But we have no evidence. So what do younintend to do? Cross your arms and wait? Remember this man, left free, is very dangerous. You'll be hearing from me. Sir? - Commissioner Pepe, please. - Please follow me. Meet Inspector Sierra, my cousin, Count de Ribera. Pleased to meet you. Have a seat. What is it? Any news about Lamberto? Yes...l think I can... I believe I can easily take care of your stud. How's that? He bought tractors with unauthorized foreign currency. That's a rather common felony, but it would do. I'll need only a few additional pieces of evidence. - You're sure you saw them? - Don't worry. You can go home and relax. You're a real friend. Ursula? What is it? Have you gone mad? What if someone comes in? There's no one here. Everyone's gone to the Fiesta. You never know. A visitor could arrive. Then he'll have something worth remembering. What are you doing there, Ursula? Taking a shower. - But it's the servants' shower! - so what? It works. Get me some orange juice. Is it fun to make love? I'm talking to you! If you hadn't taken a shower, I'd have cooled you off myself. At school I used to think of love very theoretically. But lately... Maybe it's the weather. You're drinking my orange juice! Let's go to the fiesta. I feel like seeing Lamberto. That's what you call "the weather". I've tried to be reasonable for 3 weeks now, it hasn't worked. I can think of nothing else. I want him to kiss me. You can understand that, can't you? I've never been with any man other than Miguel. - You made a real mistake then. - You're impossible! Because I see things as they are. You choose to live a lie and ruined it all. - Maybe. - You could start over. You forget my age. I'm not young anymore. I'd like to be as beautiful as you are. I no longer dare to look in the mirror. You're crazy! Look at yourself! You're young, you're beautiful. Look at your body. - It doesn't lie. - You're cruel. Why, because I force you to admit the truth? You think I'm not human? Don't you think I have my own thoughts, at night in bed? - You have the right to be happy. - No! Why are you meddling? Leave me alone! Go! Ursula! Get dressed, I'm taking you to the fiesta. They won't be killed? No, it's a fight for fun. In real fights are the bulls bigger? Much bigger. That's not a bull, it's a heifer. - But it charges like a bull. - Cows fight as well as bulls. Sometimes they're even more dangerous, they charge with their eyes wide- open. If he were dealing with a real bull he wouldn't look so fine. I'll give it a try. It doesn't look difficult. Ursula, I forbid you! What are you doing, you're crazy! Come back! Sweetie... Come back, Ursula! Come back! Thanks! Each in his own turn. You gave me such a fright! - I have to speak to you. - Go on. It's about my husband. He intends to pull a dirty trick on you. Come. I can't. Not now. - I'll wait for you in the garden. - Don't even think about it! Your husband is in Seville. It's now or never. - You're out of your mind! - Perhaps, but I'll be waiting. - I'll wait all night. - I forbid you! - Is he gone? - Yes. It wasn't worth the effort. I'll get my shoes. The bitches! It's a good thing I came back. But I'll teach them- to go to the fiesta as soon as I turn my back! What have you clone? No, no... You had no right. I thought we closed the gate. A servant must have come in. See? You didn't want to go to the fiesta... Finally, I could hardly tear you away. Lamberto, the beer I had wasn't enough today even though we had three barrels. And not enough wine either. Are you listening? The secretary even bought us a sausage. Come help me clean up a bit. Another day like this and I'll be a new woman. Not everything. Son, what are you doing? Are you drunk? Tell me! What happened? I killed Ribera. - You...? - In self- defense. Don't you believe me, mother? You're my son... If you don't believe me... Did you see it? It's Miguel's horse. Yes. What does this mean? Do what your heart dictates. True pity has nothing to do with custom. I'm sorry I'm late, but I have some important news. We identified the broken blade found in Miguel's chest. In a few hours, we'll know whom the murder weapon belonged to. I didn't realize you love Lamberto. Lamberto! Don't open. I'll expl... What is it? I heard a shout. No, you've been dreaming. Or maybe I have. Do you need anything? No, go to sleep, Ursula. Close the window. - I want to ask you... - No need for excuses. - We don't have any excuses. - I'm not looking for excuses. Keep quiet. I should despise myself but I'm madly happy. I can only think of one thing: having you to myself for good all my life. What is it? You think the police would keep us apart? - I wouldn't let that happen. - lt's not the police. I have no intention of living with you. I came for a different reason. If the police arrests me I have only one chance to defend myself effectively. To claim that I came here to see you. That's why I need your testimony. That's all you wanted, my testimony. I wanted to avoid being hung. That means something to a man. So that was it... I'll never forget last night. Never But I don't want any misunderstanding between us. Don't kiss me. The grass is damp, you'll catch a cold. What do you care? How long have you loved her? I don't love anyone, Ursula. So what were you doing in her room? One shouldn't judge anyone without knowing everything. Do you care what I think? I guess so. Sorry, Lamberto. I must arrest you. You're accused of murder. Follow us. You have no proof for detaining me. You caught him, good work! I came to warn you that Lamberto was not in the inn, we caught him at the estate. Why did you come here? To cover up your signs at the scene of the crime. It's no use, Lamberto. I have everything I need to prosecute you: a motive, evidence, your knife, and you have no alibi. Unless you prove me wrong. I had a date that night. With whom? With whom? I was hoping she would speak out. She hasn't said a word. Too bad! Take him out to the garden to have another look. I'll get dressed and I'll join you. This guy is too much... Excuse me, I have a hard day ahead of me. It's you he came to see! No! Liar! He's your lover! No! I saw him come out of your room just then. He wanted me to lie so he'd have an alibi. Why didn't you? You'd have me dishonored to save my husband's murderer? You should do anything to save the man you love. - I don't love him. - You do, you know it. - No! - Liar! Stop! Stop! Hello, Miss Ursula. Don't be afraid. Get on. Senorita is gone with the car. She's helping him escape! We must stop her. Run to the road and catch them there. At any rate, I think it's too late. I'm calling headquarters. Take the first road to your left. - Where are we going? - To Cuevas de Salinas. A friend there will help me. - Aren't you scared? - I am. You know what you're risking if you're caught with me? You spoke familiarly! They'll catch us. Shit! I don't have my driver's license on me. Step on it. If we get to the mountains we can shake them off. - Why are you helping me? - You know why. - I haven't promised you a thing. - You are near me. That's all I ask for. Are you okay? My feet hurt but I'm happy. This reminds me of my first ball. - What do you do? - All kinds of things. And lately? - I was a mechanic. - On a train? No, on a ship. - Did you get seasick? - Don't talk, save your strength. We hardly know each other. - How old are you? - Thirty- three. Your feet are bloody. My jacket could be your pillow if I could get it off... If only I could stop these sacks... These damned handcuffs are driving me crazy! How can I get them off? Damn it all to hell! What can I do? Let me be! Can't you see these handcuffs are driving me crazy? Are you afraid of me? Ursula! - What is it? - Look! Tonight, in Cuevas, I'll have them filed off. Is it far? 30 or 40 kilometers. That's too far. Too far for you, Ursula. - Must you go there? - Yes. - Why? - When I was a mechanic my ship unloaded there. - Is it there now? - I don't think so. But I'll be told where I could find it. The highway isn't far off. Over there. You'll find a taxi in Cartama. This doesn't feel like a goodbye kiss. What if we bought a donkey? We only have 3000 pesetas. It's not enough. I'll haggle. Please let me try. Let me try! He wants the donkey? Very well, for 4000 pesos. 4000, 4000! No less! - No, 3000. - 4000. Senorita, you pay the price. 4000 pesetas is cheap and it's a good donkey. No! 4000, I'll pay 3000. Look, I still have 100 pesetas for food on the way. - Hello, Carmen. - Hello. Don't you remember me? You can trust her just like me. I came to see your grandfather. Where is he? And your brother? They're not here. - When are they coming back? - I don't know. Yes you do. You must know. Speak up! They're in jail. And Captain Lorca? Was he arrested too? I don't know. You must find out his address for me. It's not easy but I'll try. - Is there some file here? - No. Let me have that. I have to make you leave. Where is she going? Hello. Could you take these off? Cut the crap! What's wrong with you? Do it or else I'll get you! Open! Why are you laughing? I remembered Florentine didn't want me in the servants' shower. - Could I try on your clothes? - Yes. No, tuck the blouse in the skirt, like this. Are you afraid? Yes. I'm afraid of disappointing you. I'll take the risk. I'm not what you think. I don't think anything. Yes you do. You think I'm a woman. - Aren't you a woman? - Don't mock me. I wanted to tell you that I've never had a lover. Not that I didn't want one... Lamberto, someone wants to speak to you. Look... - What does it say? - It's your description. Florentine gives a reward to whoever identifies you. - Does she mention you? - No. She is too scared of the scandal. We can't mess with the law, we've had enough of that. - Shall we go? - Yes. - Right now? - Yes. - Do you want Captain Lorca's address? - Yes. - San Jose street, in Chorro. - Thanks. I told you because of her. Poor Theodore. It's sad to have to sell him. Now that your description is out, we have to buy you a dress. I know. It's not too honest, what we just did. Sinning with awareness of evil isn't too bad. One can atone... As long as one doesn't lose one's awareness of evil. Come. If you don't come back in 15 minutes, I'll look for you. - Did you write this? - Yes, ma'am. Where did you see them? - Come on, speak. - Here, a clay before yesterday. - Are they still here? - No. - They slept here? - Yes. - Where are they now? - I don't know. Yes you do, stupid. Where? They didn't tell me. You're Wing! - I'm telling you the truth. - No you're not, but you will. Do you hear me? You must tell me. Alright. Let's see if you'll talk to the police. No! No! that! Well then... They went to Chorro to look for Captain Lorca. Lorca... What do you want? I came to you for help. I must leave Spain. I'm very sorry, I no longer own the ship. Could you lend me money? The police, quick! You're a piece of shit, Lorca! I'm a piece of shit? You're a murderer! Life doesn't always turn out the way we want it to. Yes, here. I've got him, hurry! I got into a lot of trouble lately. I have to make up for it. I don't believe you'll shoot. If you move, I warn you, I'll shoot! I'm going to shoot! I'm going to shoot! No, on your left! Run for it! You're eating bad stuff! That's enough! Would you keep still? You're nice. Follow me. I understand, it didn't work out. I'm afraid, Lamberto. Be quiet, you'll run out of breath. I'd rather talk, otherwise fear paralyzes me. If you want to talk, ride! - Where are we going? - Nowhere. If it's with you, it's not nowhere. I love you. A few hundred meters from here is a gorge with Whirlpools. If we go on we might drown. - And if we stop? - We'll be caught. - I don't want us to be apart. - Now or tomorrow... we can't leave Spain any more. Tomorrow, then. Please, let's go on. - It's madness. - Yes, it's madness. Form pairs and search every corner. They can't be far off. He can't have gone too far. Search everywhere. We did it, Lamberto! We're nowhere! Nowhere! Nowhere! - Did you find them? - No. I thought it was a matter of hours. They passed the Chorro gorge. You said that was impossible. I'm used to criminals, not to lovers. When will you arrest them? In Marquesano. They could hold out a few weeks. Someone must stop them! He must be killed! He's a murderer! He must be killed! Killed! Nothing. And this? We need meat. - You caught a rabbit once. - That was 3 clays ago. - And now I'm hungry. - Me too. But I don't scream. You're not on your feet all clay. Do you think I'm having a good time in this hole? Where are you going? - What are you doing? - I'm going to kill the pig. That's food for a few clays. You can't do that! For heaven's sake, this pig will starve anyway! Don't kill this little creature, Lamberto. Don't kill my pig. Don't kill him, please. He's our little friend, I love him. Murderer! No! No! I love you. I love you, my little proud animal. I love your body. I love your heat. I love you to death. I've waited so long for these words... hill'- - No... - Yes, Ursula. Before we spoil it all. No, no! Never, Lamberto! I love you. Don't ever leave me. I love you... Madame too. May the Lord reward your kindness. Yes... Yes, I'm listening. Ursula is exhausted. I'll bring her to Cerba tomorrow Come pick her up. At noon, yes. But why in a village? Isn't it too dangerous for you? I'll turn myself in. But I want to know. Ursula is safe. Don't worry. I'll take care of her. Nothing will happen to her. Don't you need anything else? Yes, I'll be there. Lamb... - I was dreaming. - About what? It's always the same dream. Don't leave me. I'm right here. Tomorrow we leave. I've called a friend. Everything is set up. - Really? - Yes. Manna- mama an. I'll be able to ask someone for directions? "Excuse me, sir, how do I get to the beach?" ls it true, Lamberto? Yes. I can't believe it! If I dream again, will you wake me up? Yes, clearest. Let's go back, Lamberto. - Why? - I don't know. Let's go back. Come on. It's the Count of Ribera's car. Strange! We were told Lamberto passed by here. I'll go tell the chief. Alright. It's you who called her! - You'll leave with her. - Never You must, Ursula. And when I'm safe, you'll join me. If you go, I'll never see you again. - Yes, you will. - swear it. Come, calm down. You can't swear it! It's over... It's over, I knew it. I knew it... Swear to me that you'll never leave me. Never... Not even for an hour, not even for a minute. I don't want you to die, my little deer... You're too young, too beautiful. But if you leave me I will die. I'm going to die. Hold her! You can't leave me, it can't be! You can't leave me! Run, Lamberto! Stop! Stop! Stop, Ursula! Stop! Stop, stop... He's going to shoot! Stop! - Where were you hit? - It doesn't hurt, you know. - Tell me you'll never leave me. - No. Not even for an hour, not even for a minute... Swear it. I swear it. Not even for a minute...
