There will be no next load, its over. Very well then, I will retire at twenty. "Catalana Gate" You still thinking about buying a truck? Sure, just hand over the money. I could give you hand. Man, in that case, maybe I will do it then. But,for starters, I would do only trips in Spain, after what we have seen. Ah, say, tell my sister to stay out of the kitchen. Tonight its my turn. Tell her yourself, I still have to report in with the police. Very well, but hurry up, why won't you. Close the door. Agreed.

Germany? what where you doing over there, Txema? Buying a new sub-machine gun? My angle is plastic explosives... Sir. The day we least expect it, this one goes back to his old ways, and sends us all to hell. Txema! Hi! Say, let go, let go! I am quite a mess! I have something important to tell you! You can tell me later, for now, I need to take a shower. No! It's now, or never! Very well, tell me. Come on. I'm pregnant. Are you sure? Yes, of course I am, man!

What do you think, if next time I go to Germany, we leave Tony home, and I take you along instead? You mean it? You would take me with you? I will go to the police tomorrow, first thing in the morning, and I will ask for a permit for Germany. Txema! Txema! i love it! i must pack, right now! Didn't you say would get no more permits? We will talk about that tomorrow. What are you saying? Elisa is my sister, why can't we discuss this now? I know what I am doing. Have you tought of what is going on in France? You could screw with you both! We can talk about that tomorrow. You are always...! I said we can talk tomorrow! Damn, they almost got you. I was lucky, today is my day, I would not have missed. This will be your death sentence! The organization has decided to kill you, who do they think they are! They want to eliminate anyone who might know something. Why? They fear the police might make us talk. What are you planning on doing? escape, with Elisa, but she must not be aware of this. That is why you are taking her to Germany, right? It is my only way out. I have no other alternatives. Coffee is not what I want right now. Don't ever leave me! Never, I will never leave you! We have to have a serious talk. Now? Aha, right now.

It is close to the best of schools, and there is a lovely park near by. it's for the boy, Txema! Say, and we can have a garden, and a dog. oh, Txema, Txema, i want a dog! And it will run out to greet you when you return home. And look, if you don't treat me right, he will bite you! Like this! like this! Why so serious? is something the matter, Txema? Listen, Imagine that I could not buy the house, and that I had to leave, far away, would you follow me? Of course I would, I would go to the end of the world with you! Txema? That thing about leaving, you can't be serious? Txema, tell me we won't Of course we won't. Ok then, have this is map, the documents for customs and everything else is in the glove box. You will earn 5% of the value of the load, if you make it. One faces quite a risk. Indeed, they overturned three more trucks yesterday. Oh my. Its ok, here, the keys to the apartment. as soon as we get settled, I will get in touch with you. Get all the money out of the bank, put the furniture in a truck, and join us. Say!

Up! look after her, Txema. Elisa, I think you should't smoke, give me that cigarrette. It was for you, I don't like it. "Jonquera- France" "Customs" What, is there a problem? It is possible, I would advise you to turn back, they are trying to cut off the road. I have to make it. In that case, good luck, you will need it. Thanks. "You are now in the Roussillon" Say, what is that? It is the produce of the Roussillon. "Vineyards and Orchards of the Roussillon" "No to Spain and Portugal." Oh my, seems the French do not like us, eh. Are you hungry? I am famished! We will stop for a fine steak, you like? Ok, but make it a huge one, I am eating for two now, don't you forget it. Agreed. "No to Spain and Portugal" Look at that Spanish swine, flashing his cash. They sell their produce to half of Europe, while ours rots in warehouses. they are complying with trade agreements, Picot. Yeah, but... Pay attention at the meetings. I would like to have half of what you earn. I think if you lot had balls, you would not let that truck pass. And if Spanish produce would not reach Germany, they would have to buy ours, at our price. Say, that story we know by heart. We are no gangsters, we don't like to burn trucks, leave us be! Yeah, buy us a drink and shut your trap! There is so much work to do here, there is no end to it. Since is no buyer for these potatoes, take them to the basement. We are expecting a load, and need to make space. Let's go. Yes? This is Mr. Marten's secretary. oh, its you, mr. Picot. One moment please. it's Picot. Thanks. yes, Picot? There is a Spanish truck here, loaded to the brim. Won't the farmers take care of that? I tried to persuade them to stop that truck, but they have no balls. I understand. Can you hire some guys? The union will pay them, and make sure they look like farmers,eh. and, Picot, that truck must not pass! Understood? Leave it to me. Oh my, I am so tired. Should we take a nap? Sure. Would you like to? Is that a question, or a proposition? Whatever the lady prefers. I tought you where "too tired" Not that much! no, no Txema, no! come on! get in, up! no no no! help! oh no! Txema! Help! Hi. Are you ready? Ready. Go ahead. it just went by, get ready. Why are we stopping? Hide in the truck and do not come out! Come, quickly, after them! Txema? Do as I say! go, do it!

You tought you would make it trough? You take me for an idiot, you damned Spaniard! Why not let me pass, one more truck, one less truck, why does it matter? Come here, come, come here!

Please, behave in a cordial manner. Does the plaintiff wish to say something to the defendants? No, your honor. And, the defense? If it pleases the court, The plaintiff has accussed my clients of assault, arson, and murder. But what proof does he have for such accusations? None, your honor. Nothing! It all happened between the couple, my clients where not even there. And the testimony I will present to this tribunal, will prove the innocense of my clients, with out a shadow of a doubt. the day of the events, the accused gentlemen, marten, and Picot, where in my office in Marseille, discussing business persuant to the Farmer's Cooperative. That is a lie! Silence! Advice your client to abstain from interrupting, or I will be forced to expell him from the court. yes, your honor. But he is lying! It is possible, but the judge must hear both sides. Silence. please continue, mr. Julot. One of the testimonies I have submitted, is of the owner of the restaurant, where the plaintiff, and his wife, had lunch the day of the incident. The owner declares they drank two bottles of wine, and one of Champagne. And the both of them where intoxicated when they left. It is not true, we drank some but we where not drunk! he is lying! take it easy And if there was still any doubt on how the accident took place, I have the withness accounts of two farmers, who were tending their fields, when they saw the truck loose control, and swerving from one side of the road to the other, skipped the shoulder, to fall ablaze in fire. That is a lie! he is lying! Silence! You, and only you, are responsible for your woman's death! Son of a bitch. Mother fucker! Order, order in the court!

Help me, Marten, help me please! for Elisa. Picot! My god! Picot, answer me! Picot! One down, two left. let's get out of here! Gentlemen, I have gathered you to study the alarming decline of out profits. In the last three months they have declined by 312% I know that the government subsidies may have something to do with it. Do not forget, if they get some money, the begin hoarding. They do not want to sell at the prices we offer. And more than one, tries to sell their products directly, without the Co-op's permission. And that is what must stop! Marten is on the phone. Excuse me, gentlemen. What's new, Marten? sir, the spaniard has returned, he just killed Picot, and now he is going to kill me! Take it easy, and listen carefully. You must not go to the police. Speak with no one about this affair, understood? But, Boss, he wants to kill me! he told Picot that he would do it! that he planned to kill me! Enough with this foolishness! He will not make another move for some time, He will be hiding, thinking the entire police force is after him. I will send you two of my best men. they will be there tomorrow, do not worry. They will protect you, and will free us from that nuisance, once and for all. Take it easy Marten, good bye. Salim, grab a couple of men and head for Seslas Speak with Marten, have him remain calm. It is very possible that maniac would try to kill him. Let him do it. What? Marten is a hinderance. If that Spaniard removes him from the equation, he would have done us a favor. But after, bring him to me. I want to attend to him, personally. Hey! Thanks. i heard about Picot. You killed him? According to the police, it was an accident. I don't like this. This is not how the organization works in France. I'm thinking... Let me give you some advice! Don't think. This is Blue Dancer on special mission with Goma 2 I have some suspicions. Require order confirmation. You can locate me on 4536370 in Seslas. Immideate confirmation, I repeat, immediate confirmation.

Listen, I have money! I will give you what you want, I will make you rich! I will kill you. No, I don't want to die incinerated! I don't want you to burn me! I don't want you to burn me! No! No! No! No! No! Two down. One left. Let's go, hurry! Yeah. Grab the truck, and wait for me at the Nimes toll plaza. Agreed. oh, Txema, the whole city is on the alert. Was it you?
