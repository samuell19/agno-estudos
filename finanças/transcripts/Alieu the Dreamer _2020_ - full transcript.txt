Good evening. Our lead story tonight... it has been three months since everyone in the world lost the ability to dream. Instead, seeing a mysterious light whenever we sleep. I don't know what the light is. It has to be a message from God. I don't know why this is happening. It just is really annoying that nobody's telling us what's happening. The UN released a statement saying that despite tireless efforts there are no leads in understanding what the light is or what caused this supernatural phenomenon while religious leaders debate whether or not the light is a sign from God and what it could mean. So we pray. - Our Father... - Our Father... - who art in heaven - who art in heaven - hallowed be Thy name. - hallowed be Thy name. - Thy kingdom come - Thy kingdom come - Thy will be done - Thy will be done - on earth as it is in heaven. - on earth as it is in heaven. Your souls are black with sin! Repent and come into the light! Your souls are black with sin! Repent and come into the light! Your souls are black with sin! Repent and come into the light! Your souls are black with sin! Repent and come into the light! Your souls are black with sin! Repent and come into the light! Rev. Venus will show you God's truth! The anniversary is upon us. You need to see God's light. The body. The body is your salvation. Lay to waste your worldly possessions. Rev. Venus will show you God's true light. The anniversary is upon us. You need to lay to waste your worldly possessions. The anniversary is upon us. Rev. Venus will show you God's true light. Alieu Bowuhki? Yeah. I'm Dr. Maya Sanders. This is Cheng Yu Gow and Steven Flynn. We're from the Department of Health and Human Services. In response to your claim. Close the door behind you. So you think you're dreaming? I am. What neuroleptics are you taking? None. You're not on any neuros? Propofol, Cognazole, Amnitole? I tried all of them, okay? None of them worked. How are you coping with chronic irritability and memory loss? Christ, how have you been sleeping? I'm not. Hey, Cheng, can you start moving some of this stuff, please so we can get set up? I'm just saying, if I go a day without taking neuros I feel like I wanna murder somebody. Hey. Do you know what happens when people lie to us? It's perjury. You could do time. At the very least, it's tens of thousands of dollars in penalties. You think I'm lying? Don't make me do this to you. Can I get a shot of you over here, please? By the wall. All right. Say cheese. State your full name and age. Alieu Bowuhki, 25. What's your mother's full name? Her name was Talieu. Talieu Bowuhki. She passed away last year. What's your father's full name? I don't know. Are you a part of any religious organizations such as Elimination Collective, Children of the Light The Body, et cetera? No. Do you see the light when you sleep? I used to, not anymore. And you're having dreams? Yeah. And how long has the dream been causing you pain? I don't know. Maybe right after I reached out to you guys like a couple months ago. Is there anything that triggered it? I don't know why this is happening to me. Can you make a fist for me? No, you ain't about to stick me. It's okay. It's just an anesthetic to help expedite your REM sleep. Yeah, okay, and people get addicted to that stuff. We all see the light when we sleep so we all have the same brain activity. If you're dreaming, then we'll see something different but you have to be asleep. It's the only way we can know for sure. I've done this a million times. It's perfectly safe. It's okay. Okay, relax. Hey, something's wrong! Cheng, tell me what's happening! I don't know! - Is he all right? - I don't know! Holy shit! What is it? You're dreaming. Please, you gotta help me stop this. I wouldn't believe it if I weren't there. And this is a huge breakthrough. I mean, we need to get him in here for the next round of tests. We need to figure out how and when we're gonna alert the media. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. What do you mean? You were there. You saw what we saw. What I saw was you administer the anesthetic improperly and lose control of the analysis. And it's rather convenient that this revelation aligns with my being here. How much longer do I have to deal with this asshole? Maya, could you give us a second, please? I need something stronger than coffee. You know there's gonna be a documentary about this. We're getting book deals for sure. Yo! We're finally gonna figure out how to dream again. - Wasn't your last dream pretty... - Cheng... I've been here for years. Who do you think you are? - They have been out... - Do you know - who you're dealing with? - Do you know - who you're dealing with? - Listen, do you understand me? Do you understand me? There's no easy way for me to tell you this so I'm just gonna say it. Steven was asking about your investigation into The Body. He's pushing to get it shut down. No. You can't let him do that. Well, he says it's not within the scope of our department. And I agree with him. Do not talk to me about "scope." Rev. Venus is running a cult. People are dying. It's a health crisis. And you have yet to provide any real proof of that. Maya, I know what the reverend and The Body did your family and I get it. But that's all the more reason why you shouldn't be investigating them. How are you maintaining your objectivity? You need to grow a pair of ovaries. And you need to go somewhere else with that attitude! Happily. Why would you drape yourself in all black like the nihilist devils in the Illumination Collective? There's a reason why The Body has millions of followers in the US and overseas and it's because we're the only way to God's light. And it's because we're the chosen. And it's our duty to give others the gift of salvation. In the words of Reverend Venus, "Be steadfast, brothers and sisters for the unholy are tenacious in their sinister works." The anniversary is upon us! Join The Body! Let Reverend Venus show you God's light. He can teach you, sir. The anniversary is upon us, everyone! Join The Body! ...just around the corner. And it's that time of year when we reflect on the coming of the light and what it means to us. We asked our audience for testimonies. And there was one in particular that I think is especially moving. And I wanted to share it with you. "When I see the light, it fills me with wonder. Its brightness, its form, its silence. It brings us together like we are all from the same family. It has to be God watching over us." As you can see, Alieu Bowuhki's brain activity is unlike anything we've seen. This could be the key to understanding how and why we stopped dreaming. Are you even sure that someone like this could even develop the ability to dream? Dr. Sanders, at this point it's been, what? Thirty-something years? I mean, none of this feels relevant. Senator, the negative effects of not dreaming have been a plague on society for decades. I mean, we need a cure. It's "a plague on society." Doctor, maybe we could avoid the hyperbole. I'm not speaking in hyperbole. During REM sleep, our brains are supposed to process information and experiences from the day, which sometimes resulted in dreams. Now, whether you used to remember your dreams or not this process was essential to our mental and emotional development. Retaining memory learning new skills, coping with stress. Thirty years ago, our brains stopped going through that process. Doctor, there are plenty of FDA-approved medications that treat the side effects of not dreaming. Yes, the government has made a lot of money keeping everyone dependent on a cocktail of pills, but it's not a solution. Well, I've been taking my ration of neuros and I feel fine. Taking neuros is like using a Band-Aid to cover a gunshot wound. Our immune systems are still only 40% of what they should be. We're suffering from higher blood pressure more strokes, more mental illness, higher levels of cancer. I'd like to know what your investigation into Reverend Venus and The Body has to do with any of this. With all due respect, Senator, I don't see how that's relevant. The answer is nothing. The whole endeavor is a waste of resources. No, it's not. Reverend Venus has fooled, possibly, millions of people into thinking that he's still dreaming and receiving messages from God. But he has not submitted to an analysis by this department because people like you pass laws that protect him from having to do so. - Hey, you listen to me! - No, sir, you listen to me! - I resent you... - There are higher rates of drug abuse, mental illness, and suicide among people who leave The Body than any other demo in America. - It is a cult, sir. - How dare you speak that way about my beliefs? As far as I'm concerned none of this is worth the department's time or energy. End of story! Hello? Hey, yeah, I'm on my way, I promise. Just give me like, ten minutes, please. Don't leave. Just ten minutes. I gotta go, bye. We saw you had the police at your spot last night. Thought you joined the force. - It's not the police, man. - Yo, let him be, man. Let him be. - What, you an informant now? - Let him be. Yo, T, get your lapdogs off of me, man. - Oh, yo... - What's up? - Hey! - What you think you're doing? - Come on, man! - What I say to you? - What I say to you? - I swear to God if that wasn't your cousin, bro, I'd lay his ass out. Yeah? Say it again. Tell me what you'll do. Say it right now. Say it to me! 'Cause if that's what it is, we can handle that right now, bruh. Come on, man. You trippin'. Come on. - Come on, man! - Go ahead, man. I'll see you! That's right! You good? Sorry. Sorry, I... Look, I had something come up. "Sorry" ain't gonna get me to work on time. - Here, let me take that for you. - I got it. - Alieu? - Yeah? If you want to see Jamila and you want to take her to the doctor and you wanna take her to the babysitter I need you to be here when you say you're gonna be here. I know. Look, I... I started talking to some people about me dreaming. You told someone about the dream? Alieu, why would you do that? I need help making this stop. They don't know what the light is, they don't know anything. What can they do to help you? I know, but I gotta do something, okay? Look, I'm not even sleeping right these days. I can't breathe. I'm not even eating right. How am I supposed to take care of you and a baby if I... I don't need you to take care of me. But I can't have you doing this out here on your own, Fati. I... Can you pick her up tonight? I have to work the graveyard. Yeah, for sure. I'm gonna take her the rest of the way. Wait... Hold on. Just... Can I get something to get me through the day? Hey! Hey, Jamila, how you doing? How you doing? Smile for Daddy. Here, smile for Daddy today. - Okay. - You get it? All right, that's all right. That's all right, baby. All right. We'll be broadcasting from around the world but I wanna assure everybody it will be after the game. But why have this celebration now? Well, in my most recent dream God showed me the dawn of a new age is upon us. Everything is about to change. So, what can we expect? You'll have to wait and see! Hey! What? It just hit me that since the economy is trash and we're definitely getting fired after today I'm not gonna be able to pay my rent. All the other analysts have been laid off. They're not gonna fire us. I'm gonna have to move in with my mom. And she's way into the Unified Radiance. Of all the neo-religions, she had to pick the craziest one. What are you doing? Maya, that's not smart. They could be monitoring your activity. Taking off early. Don't touch that. Hey. Hey. Hey, little cuz. Hey, cutie. Look at her, man. She getting big, bro. Right? What's good, Tariq? What it do, black man? What you need? I can't sleep. But now I get these headaches, and I know you got that strong shit. You're on your own like that. You gotta go to the clinic and get your ration. Man, those government pills ain't doing it for me. Just let me get something light, bro. You know what I'm saying? To keep me alert. - All right. - Yo! These fiends is out here getting worse, bro. I've been pushing so many neuros it's hard to keep up, man. I hate this place. Man, Auntie totally worked like three jobs trying to provide a home for you, man. Now you talking about you hate this place? That's weak, cuz. The hood made you, bro. Look, you know what I mean. I just feel like I'm stuck. So that's why you brought them white folks around here yesterday. You think they gonna save you? You have no idea what this even feels like. You're right, I don't. But I know you got a gift. And you need to start being careful who you share that gift with, man. What kind of "gift" makes you feel like this? A gift that might be preparing you for something bigger. Bye-bye, little cuz. Take care of your daddy. Breathe in. Breathe out. In. Out. The light is a singular consciousness that finds us. God has chosen Reverend Venus, the last dreamer, to... Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that was just... I just had to get some... I can't watch you do this to yourself again. You're gonna end up like Dad. No, I'm not gonna do that to myself. You're doing it right now. Stop. I feel empty. I can see that you do, too. And look, that's okay. Don't do that. You're so far adrift. - I mean, we can... - Oh, my God. Okay, you know what? The Body took everything from us! You had a wife, a job, a home, and now you sleep on my couch. The only things that you have are what I have to give you! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I had a hard day. It's okay. Do you need a hug? No. Come here. Come on. Lay to waste your worldly possessions. - Stop it. - Cast them away. - Make way for the light. - Marcus, I swear to God. The light is a singular consciousness - that finds us. - Stop it! We are one! Lay to waste your worldly possessions! - Stop it! - Bring them to the altar! Bring them all to the altar! Bring them all before they tear you from the light! Come on, Maya! I suffered from depression and was addicted to neuros and anesthetics. But then I became a part of The Body. Now, I stabilized my doses and my depression is completely gone. We are a network of friends and family here to ensure that you always feel supported. So ask yourself, what can The Body do for you? I've had a vision of great things on the horizon. Join me at our community center on the anniversary when we welcome in a new age of humanity together. So, Venus released another promo for the anniversary thing. You wanna go? Cheng, did you take that hard drive? No. You looking for this? Can I speak with you a moment? Where's Shannon? Now. Can't just go taking people's stuff. - Oh, yes, I can. - No, you can't. Let me tell you what. This is your termination notice. - You understand me? - You can't fire me! Does the word "classified" mean anything to you at all? Does the word "fraud" mean anything to you at all? I wouldn't go that far because... Hey. Hey, stop that. - What do you think you're doing? - Hey! You can't do through her stuff like that. Hey! Hey, you can't touch that. Do not touch that! Your computers and hard drives and files are property of the United States government. Escort her out, please. Do not touch me! Get off me! - You can't do this! - Don't... Hey! Like you have any power here? Like you have any power! You can't do this! Let go of me! Get off me! Get off me. We're sorry... We're sorry, you have reached... All right. Okay... Baby... Hold on... Hey! Hey, Cheng! Hey, I tried to reach you. Our phones and e-mails are cut off. No, just yours. Hey, what's your problem? Behind us. He's been following me since I left the office. You couldn't lose him? Lose him? I don't know how to lose somebody. You looking for me? Right here! I need you to get backups of all my files. Everything on Venus, The Body, and Alieu Bowuhki. - Maya, come on. - I'll get you a hard drive. I can't do that. If they're monitoring you, they're definitely monitoring me. We find a dreamer and within two days they're stopping us from learning anything more about him. They're shutting down the Venus investigation. They're firing me. - And now you're getting followed? - Maya... Something is going on! They fired you because you tried to smuggle classified information out of a government building which I warned you not to do. And the other stuff, you just gotta let it go. It's not worth it. Wha... I made your favorite. It's a peace offering. Hey, I'm sorry about last night. I'll try harder, I promise. You okay? They fired me today. What? Why? I keep losing everything. You have me. Yeah, well you're all I have left. We found a dreamer. Well, what do you mean? I don't understand. That's not possible... It's true. We found a guy who's dreaming. Reverend Venus is the only one that can dream. That's... Marcus, listen to me. Venus is not dreaming. He never was. You don't know that for sure. How do you know this other guy's even really dreaming? We have proof. Indisputable. I saw it. You're lying. I would never lie to you. Ever. You have reached the voicemail box of... Marcus. At the tone, please record your voice message. Marcus, it's me. Please, please give me a call when you get this. Throughout the history of all monotheist belief God has always chosen a messenger or a vessel to spread the gospel. And we've seen this in forms of Moses, and Peter, Joseph Smith the Prophet Muhammad, even Christ himself. So, my anomalous gift, my... my blessing, is not without precedence. Reverend, what if there is something that gives us doubt? Nothing is more important than your faith and your dedication to God and The Body. If anything threatens that, it must be eliminated. Excuse me. It would appear I need to take care of something. Miss Grace will lead the meditation until I return. Okay, let's begin. Lay to waste your worldly possessions. - Lay to waste - Lay to waste - your worldly possessions. - your worldly possessions. I know he's here! Do not touch me! Just calm down. Marcus! I need you to calm down. Well, there's no need to be so rough. We're old friends. Maya, well, you've grown into such a beautiful young woman. Where is he? Where is who? Marcus. Where is he? Oh, he's left us, dear. I haven't seen him in months. I know he's here. I have no reason to lie. But if you'd like, I can help you find him. Come with me to my office... Oh, look at you. Still a lost, angry little girl. Pains me to see how far adrift you've gone. I worry that you might suffer the same fate as your father. If he comes here... you turn him away or I will fucking kill you. Do you understand me? You see how those who are adrift are filled with anger? When you lose faith you open yourself to that kind of darkness. Be steadfast. Mr. Gow? What do you want from me? It should come as no surprise, this team is being dismantled. We were able to give Shannon a promotion. A bigger role, more money. I'd like to do the same for you. But I need to feel certain that everything we know about Alieu Bowuhki and Maya's investigation will remain classified. Yeah, I'm not comfortable with that. It would be easier for the both of us if I could trust you. Maybe you should call your Gestapo up here to throw me out. Aligning yourself with Maya would be bad for you, Mr. Gow. You should have come to us sooner. I needed to gather the facts to get ahead of any possible fallout. Do you have any idea how this looks? You put me in that department to do a job. And now I've done it. Yeah, with the tact of a six-year-old. If Maya or this Cheng guy go public, how am I supposed to spin that? Is it true? Sir? This Alieu, is he really the first dreamer? Well, besides you, sir. Well, then, he needs to be with us. Bring him to me. I'll have someone I trust assist you. Reverend, you knew, right? That there was another dreamer? I mean, certainly one of your visions made you aware. It sounds like you're asking from a place of doubt. Of course not. Okay, then. I got it. Hey, baby Jamila. - Hey, baby. - There you go! You know, I'm-a go food shopping when I get my next check. You know, one of those good grocery stores across town. I'll get a whole bunch I'm-a bring it over to your place. You don't have to do that. I know. I can't be having y'all eating the food around here. That shit's poison. It'll kill you. What shit? This shit? Hey, it's free, right? Hey. What? When you coming back home? I can't be there with you mad at the world every day. All day. You have too much anger in you, Alieu. That mentality, it's contagious. Can't have our daughter around it. Hey, we got a whole load of dishes back here waiting. I ain't paying you to go on dates. Go ahead. Go ahead. Let's get ready to go. Tell Daddy bye. We need to do something about this. We can't prove anything, so, what can we do? Okay, we have to do something. You're coming with me. Maya, we shouldn't be doing this. Let's go. - Hey. - Hey. You guys figure it out? We got shut down. Wait... Hold on, you said I was the first dreamer, right? You are the first dreamer. But you said this was a big deal. How do you guys get shut down? This is a big deal! There are other people... Why does it seem like nobody cares? I care! Look, I have to figure out how it is that you are able to dream but there is something bigger going on right now. And I don't know what for sure but I think that you might be in danger, okay? I need you to get out of town and lay low for a while. It's not safe for you here. I see you around here again, there's gonna be a problem. Register was short today. Yeah? It's coming out your pay. I don't even work the register. You're lucky I don't call the cops! Hello? Kitchen's closed! We're here to see Alieu Bowuhki. This ain't no damn hangout! Do I know y'all? Not yet. - I'm Lillian. This is Marcus. - Hi. Did y'all not hear me when I said we're closed? Oh, we heard the way you were speaking to Alieu. I'm sure we can find one or two safety and health issues to shut this place down. So why don't you go back there and leave us alone? Don't let me see you around here again! If you hear what we have to say I promise you won't need to work for anyone for the rest of your life. You've been told that you're the first person to dream after all this time. That you're alone. How do you know about that? You've been lied to. You're not the only one. There's someone else can dream just like you. What do you know about the Reverend Shawn Venus? Y'all evangelists, huh? No, we're a family. We like to take care of each other, and we wanna take care of you. Reverend Venus has visions just like you do. And when he heard about your ability he immediately took an interest in your gift. This ain't no gift, all right? I ain't interested in joining some damn religion. I used to be like you... Lost at sea. Thrown back and forth with every storm. Reverend Shawn Venus, he saved me. The Body can provide you with steady ground so you can provide for yourself. You can provide for your daughter. People will eventually learn about your gift. And a storm will come that you cannot weather alone. This is a direct line set up just for you. When you need it. Yo. We gonna do the re-up this time, man. Oh, shit, let me holla at cuz real quick, man. What's up? Ain't nothing. You straight? No. I quit my job. That's what's up. You was way better than that place, man. Look, man, I was hoping I could come out here and work with you, you know? No, man. Get outta here with that. Come on, I'm serious, T. You better than this street shit, man. No, I'm not! See, there you go. Ain't nobody gonna see value in you that you don't already see in yourself. That's why your girl left you. Yeah, I said it. What? You need to man up, bro. What am I supposed to do, then? What, you need a loan? No, I don't need a loan, I need work! The street work ain't for you! Hey, yo, Lieu, what's with you, man? What's with you lately? You hot out here 'cause don't nobody give a damn about you and your little dreams? You begging these white folks to save you, but where they at? You know what? How about you tell me what I'm supposed to do then, huh? Start worrying about your baby girl, that's what you do. She is all I'm worried about! Why do you think I get off my mattress every single morning? You see me walking across the same parking lot every single day trying to hustle out here. You see me! I'm trying to be like you, man! Tell me what I'm supposed to do! You can do something that nobody else in this world can do and you out here begging these people to take it from you. That ain't hustling, nigga, that's dumb! Yeah, go up there and get you some sleep, man. You look tore up! Thank you, gentlemen, for taking time out of your busy schedules to be with me here today. Now, you've all heard me speak of a new and prosperous age in our society. Those documents before you outline what needs to be in place in order for that to become a reality. Now, we're going to need government funding for our new worship centers and community centers. Exclusive access to foreign officials as well as deeper tax cuts for all of our... Reverend, we have been very accommodating to your needs in the past, but this is a bridge too far. Have you all been accommodating me all of this time? I did not mean that as... Because if I remember correctly, I have raised over a billion dollars collectively for all of your campaigns over the years. You are on Capitol Hill because I put you there. So, who is accommodating whom? But what you're asking us to do, we would have to siphon funds from education, the military, Medicare. An unspeakable disruption to our federal budget. How can we justify that to our colleagues? To our constituents? My congregation is millions strong across red and blue states, gentlemen. All of them are registered voters who take my endorsements to the ballot box. I am your only constituent. What do you say about the revelations of another dreamer, Alieu Bowuhki? I say nothing. There are some who believe that this could lead to an understanding of why no one else can dream. That could lead to a cure. And that would be catastrophic to our budget. We need these funds for initiatives... The situation with Alieu is under control. I also imagine it would affect the influence you have over your congregation. If I didn't know you as a loyal member of my congregation, Senator I would take that as a threat. No, sir, I would never. You have your directives. We're adjourned. We heard from Lillian and Marcus? They've had some trouble. Perhaps our friend needs a little push. Good afternoon. The Department of Health and Human Services has indeed found evidence of a dreamer. His name is Alieu Bowuhki, and he lives here in the city. In the Southeast Projects, to be exact. Now, two of our employees, Maya Sanders and Cheng Yu Gow found and withheld this information from us. Their employment has been terminated. Are you serious? We have to go public, release a statement or something. It's too late for that. Well, this is... I can't believe they just said where he lives. I can't believe this. This is amazing. We're still gathering all the facts. But our field reporters are en route to the Southeast Projects and... Alieu, is it true? You can dream? Reverend Venus is the only dreamer! Do you have God? Do you have God? Answer me! Blasphemer! Blasphemer! We are here in the Southeast Projects outside the home... I was trying to get up the stairs, and then all of a sudden people started swarming me and attacking me and asking me all kinds of questions. Okay, just calm down. I may gonna go get someone to cover my shift and I'll come right over. No... Seriously, I don't even think you should come over here. Okay, so, what do you want me to do? Take care of Jamila. Yeah, of course. T, can you give me a moment? - You sure? - Yeah. All right, you know where I'm at, man. Yeah? Yeah. Hold on. Jeez. I'm so glad you called. May I come in? I'm alone. It's not right for you to be holed up here like this. I'll see to it that the mob is cleared away so you won't be bothered, hmm? So I hear you can dream. Like me. Is that true? I hear you want to stop dreaming. Is that true? Stop thinking about how hard it is to have the dream and consider how the dream can help you. Yeah. Why do I get the feeling you're more interested in what my dream can do for you? Son. There is a crowd of people outside who can't wait to get a glimpse of you to hear what you have to say. A dreamer! - There's great power in that. - Look, I don't want power. Okay? They say you can help me make this stop. I wanna know how to make this stop. Tell me what you need. I have a daughter, and I have a girl. And I wanna be there for them. I wanna be in their life. I wanna be there for my daughter like my father never was. I wanna be a father. Fathers... they ruin us when they're absent or unable to provide. Makes you wonder. "Was I nothing to him? Was I... broken?" Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. Maybe I do. Those people outside will give you and your daughter everything in the world if you can make them believe in you. I can show you how to do that. What do you want from this? Well, I need you to join my congregation. To help further legitimize everything that I've been building for decades. Yeah, you want me to lie? Oh, the concept of truth and lies is long since dead. Perception is all that matters. And there is nothing wrong with using it to your advantage. Is this... is this your little girl? If I do this... she wants for nothing, you understand? Hey. Are you okay? I told you I had something to show you. Whose car is that? Check this out. What is that? - Take it. - No, what is that? It's $20,000. Alieu, where did you get $20,000 overnight? I got a job. You got a job that pays you $20,000 overnight? Hey, I'm not even hustling, either. I ain't on these streets. Okay, look, if all goes according to plan they'll be much more where this comes from. I can finally move us to that place we always been talking about. I can put Jamila in a safe school, a nice neighborhood. Like we don't gotta work for nothing no more. - You don't even gotta go to work... - This doesn't make sense. What are you talking about? Trust me, please. Just take it. You still look really exhausted. No, no. Go. Go ahead. Yo, what's good, cuz? You was out? Yeah. Yo. Come on, man, what is that? It's money, my nigga. Come on, T, I know what it is. What's it for? Hey, yo, you know we good, man. I don't need you to pay it back. Just take some time, get on your feet. Get you a job, and I got you until then, man. I'm good, man, I'm straight. You got a job? Bruh. Yo, Lieu, I told you that street shit ain't for you, man. Look... trust me, it's legit. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, don't worry about it. It's all taken care of. I just... I don't know what this shit is but I feel like you about to make a dumb-ass move. Hello? Yeah, I'll be down in a second, I'm sorry. That ain't gonna save you, bro. - There he is! - Mr. Presidential! Where the uniform at, though? Huh? Don't forget where you at. Oh, here he come. Mr. Officer, yeah. He got the personal driver and everything, huh? Oh, look, he got a fluffy badge. That must be limited edition. Right, you got your uniform in there? Yeah, you know not to come around here in that joint. - Yeah, we don't talk around here. - Yeah. Father, thank You for your boundless gifts, and for Your mercy as I ask forgiveness for my many sins. I seek pardon for my many... deceptions. I pray they are not for naught. What do you want? I can take you to your brother. Order my steps, Lord. Let me be an effective shepherd for your flock. Guide me... Maya, come on! ...as I guide them to your light. Usher me to my full potential as I usher them to theirs. Happy anniversary, sir. And to you, my friend. In Your Son's eternal name. Amen. I look good, right? I mean, I don't even look like myself. That all right with you? Don't start. Come in. Wow! Looking good! - How do you feel? - I'm okay. He's gonna make us very proud tonight. Yeah, I bet. Please stay to watch. It's gonna be a good show. I have to go pick up our daughter. I'll have a car waiting for you out back. It will take you anywhere you wanna go. Thanks. Good luck tonight. Alieu, I want to be optimistic, I do. But I don't feel good about this. Any of it. Come on, look... look around you, okay? Look at this place. Look at the people. They're here for us. They're building me up. - They're lifting me up. - Alieu... why you act like I ain't been there with you? I'll walk you out. Take care of yourself. Hey. - Can I see you later? - Yeah. Tonight is a monumental night. Not only is it the 30th anniversary of when the light came to us and united us it is also the new... She's here. Everything okay? Yes. Where's the media going to be? Along the back and near the exits. It's going to be a full house. Clear the theater. Nobody in or out until I say so. - They say my brother's here. - He is. I wanna see him right now. Your father was a good and faithful man. I'm sorry I couldn't save him. - Spare me. - Your mother as well. - She was a wonderful woman. - They're gone because of you. I would say that your leaving had more to do with it. - That's not true. - Is it not? When you left, I saw them descend into despair. They went so far adrift because you abandoned them they couldn't handle it. You won't get away with this. Oh, my dear, if I were trying to get away with something it would appear that I already have. - You've always been a fraud. - Oh, so many people think otherwise. Because you're a liar. Don't you see everything that I have sacrificed? I have dedicated my entire life to saving mankind from itself. I have manipulated the highest officials in this government to do my bidding and it was easy! You people have no resolve. You can't be trusted to guide yourselves so I will take your tiny little limp wrists into my fists and I will drag you up to the mountaintop. And when I get there you will thank God that He gave me the power to do so. I wanna hear you say you could never dream. But you already know, now don't you? - Yeah, I do. - Yeah. And tell me, Maya does it make you feel better to know? Are you fulfilled? Or do you feel just as empty as you always have? Aren't you tired of fighting? Why don't you just accept the nature of things? Take me to my brother. Right this way. Marcus. - Good. - Thank you. Don't be too long. We'll be starting soon. Yes, sir. Hi. - What does he have planned? - Planned? He's not gonna be giving out Kool-Aid to everyone. Come home. - Please? - I can't. I wouldn't make it out there, Maya. But none of this is real. You can't believe anything he says. I have to believe it. I have to. There it is... There it is. Take this. There you go! - Hey, baby Jamila! - Hey! Come in. Ready to go? I heard you talking to Maya earlier. You've been lying to everyone this entire time. Does it matter? I'm not doing this. I would think about what's best for your daughter if I were you. - Oh, I am. - Are you? Yeah. Clearly you don't know how to handle your own abilities. Neither do you. Look at this. Spoken like a true savior, huh? With your own cross to bear and everything. Tell me something, dreamer. Christ himself was crucified. He was nailed to a cross. What do you think they're gonna do to you... a little black boy from the projects? When I call your name you will walk out on that stage and you will do as you're told. Understand? Do you remember the last dream you had? I don't remember my dreams. What about you? Dad used to play this game with us when we were little. We'd be lying on the floor watching TV or whatever and he would crawl up behind us... put his arms over our bodies, and pretend he was asleep. And just trap us there on the floor with him. And then we'd have to fight to get out from under his arms. - Do you remember that? - Yeah, you screamed so loud. Yeah. But something about it made me feel secure, you know? Safe. My last dream... was just Dad holding us down on the floor. And we were safe. Where were you the last time that you felt safe? I was here. In The Body. I'm so, so tired of fighting. Then stop. Thank you. Please take your seats. We'll be getting started in a moment. I have to go watch. Marcus, please... I am always going to be here for you, Maya. Always. And here is where I will be. Our leader, the Reverend Shawn Venus. Welcome, everyone. Tonight is a monumental night. Not only is it the 30th anniversary of when the light came to us to unite us it is also the start of a new era of The Body. Now, I want to introduce you to somebody very, very special. Now, this young man has a gift just like mine. And I know that he is going to be a beacon to help lead us into this new era. Please welcome, Alieu Bowuhki. It would seem I have a few surprises in store for me as well. Hey. So I'm on my way home right now. Yeah, I know you were right. Look, I still wanna see you tonight. Yeah. In my dreams, I see a world... with no war... no poverty, no division, and a booming economy! God has shown me that we can make this a reality. Over the years, our numbers have grown. We are millions strong across the US and growing exponentially, internationally every single day. We are doctors, we are lawyers, we are teachers we have seats in the House, we have seats in the Senate and soon they will know. We are even Supreme Court Justices. Yes, it's true! - Yo, Lieu, Lieu! - Hey, behind you... Blasphemer! - Lieu! - You're a lie! Everything I knew is a lie! Lieu, Lieu, stay with me. Stay with me, bro. I'm right here, bro. Lieu, stay with me, bro. Stay with me, bro. - Somebody call 911! - Move... Take the baby. We are going to remake the world as we see fit. The way that it should be. Since our foundation the unfaithful have questioned our legitimacy. They've laughed at our beliefs and they've used their cynicism to try to divide us from our vision. But tonight, their voices will fall by the wayside and only ours remain. Lay to waste your worldly possessions. Lay to waste your worldly possessions. Cast them off, for they keep you from the light. Cast them off, for they keep you from the light. The light has come to remind us... - We are one. - We are one. That we are one. Lay to waste your worldly possessions. Lay to waste your worldly possessions. Bring them to the altar. - Bring them to the altar. - Bring them to the altar. Let them burn in the light. - Let them burn in the light. - Let them burn in the light. We are one. - We are one. - We are one. - We are one. - We are one. Jamila... Hey, baby, you okay? What do you need? Jamila... She's sleeping. You wanna see her? Hold on. Okay. I heard you talking to Maya earlier. You've been lying to everyone this entire time. That doesn't matter. Now's not the time to get righteous. I'm not doing this. I would think about what's best for your daughter if I were you. Oh, I am. Translator: IYUNO
