Why? You didn't believe in Karina H., so why would you be excited that we found her? [sighs] Carleigh, you asleep? -Yes. -[all chuckling] MS. KAY: [distant] What is all that noise in there? KIDS: Nothing. MS. KAY: All right, now! You had your fun for the day. Now, take y'all hind parts to bed! KIDS: Yes. Tomorrow we're going to find her. I promise. ♪♪♪ [knocking on door] Hi, Mrs. Jeffcoat. Um, I'm here to drop off a gift from the partners. -Oh. -One sec. -Here you go. -REENA: Thank you. Enjoy, and congratulations. So you're in the big leagues now, huh? I-- I guess so. [overlapping chatter] Good afternoon, everyone. In today's mediation, we will attempt to settle matters of the divorce proceeding in private mediation with hopes that we can settle this divorce private-- Give her everything. Excuse me? Diane, you can have it all. The money, the houses, the cars, the businesses. Just don't take away Hillary. Please! Mr. Hyatt, this is wildly inappropriate. Don't say anything. I'm a good dad and you know it. I'm not taking your daughter away. Los Angeles is less than an hour away. You know as well as I do that her primary home and caregiver should be me. [clears throat] Mr. Hyatt... due to the nature of your job and how much you travel for work, as well as your long hours, it just doesn't make sense for you to be the stable primary caregiver of your daughter. Exactly. Should she be raised by your assistant? MR. HYATT: I've never missed a single soccer game. I've been to every PTO meeting. But it would require a significant amount of restructuring in your day-to-day life for any court to grant you full or even 50-50 custody. I've had enough of this. See you in court, Diane. Well, that went well. DR. PRICE: Great job today, Reena. You really brought it home. Put the pressure on 'em. Right. Uh... I mean, it kind of sounds like he'd be willing to do what needed to be done where joint custody would be fair and also kind of makes sense, right? Well, should we be advising Mrs. Hyatt of that? [chuckles] [sighs] Girl, divorce is not about being fair. You should get that out of your head right now. This is about winning and taking as much from your opponent as you can. -Great job today. -Thanks. ♪♪♪ [keyboard clacking] Read the phone number to me again. -555-8536. -Thank you. How old do you think she is now? -Old. -DAISY: Yeah, like 30. Really old. She is actually probably closer to 35. I'm gathering that she was about nine or ten when she moved away from here. 25 years makes her 35. -Old. [chuckles] -Old. [chuckles] Is that her address right now? -Yes. -And how do you know that's her? I know it's her because the probability of more than one Karina Holloway living at the same address, moving more than five times to the same area, and then returning to the same area is less than 1%. What? Don't worry about it. It's her. Like, we can go to this address right now, and she'll be there? Yes. Maybe we shouldn't do that. Not without calling first. -Her phone number. -You really are a genius. I know. [dial tone droning] REENA: Hello? -Uh, is this Karina H.? -Uh, yes. -What? -Yeah. You just had her on the phone. We just wanted to make sure it was her, right? And y'all call me dumb. So, what do we do now? Well, we have an address and we have a phone number. -We go meet Karina H. -Exactly. ♪♪♪ It's going to be across the street. HAVEN: This is it. KIDS: Whoa. This is really nice. CARLEIGH: She definitely isn't one of us. -Maybe she's a doctor. -Or an actress. I wonder if she got a daughter. -What are you doing? -No point in wasting time. [knocking] REENA: No more clothes or outfits, but-- Mr. Hyatt, you cannot be here. I did some research on you. You're from Vegas, just like me. I'm a busy man, but I make time for my daughter always. I took her to my favorite places as a child. Sunset Park, old convenience stores. Honey Buns and pop. Please. Don't take her away from me, the only home she's ever known. Mr. Hyatt, you're not supposed to be here. I'm sorry. [knocking] Hello. Can I help you? [chuckling] Are you selling something? Marry me. Are you Karina H.? I am. And who are you? My name is Liberty. This is Daisy, Michael, Carleigh, Lailah, and Haven. Okay... We live in your old house, on Crescent Avenue. We found your old time capsule in the closet of our house mother's room. See? And we took the map that you had, and we went to all the places on it. Except for the ranch. It was closed. But then we found your last letter in the fake rock. In this letter, you told us to find you and invite you to the house we love just as much as you. MICHAEL: I got you, baby. That's not the only reason why we came. So there's more? LAILAH: We were wondering if you could save the house. Well, what's going on with the house? HAVEN: Well, Ms. Kay, she's the woman that owns it. And our house mother. She's tired of taking care of us, so she sold it. CARLEIGH: And in some days, Child Services will come and split me and my brother up. Okay, and what are you saying that I'm supposed to do about that? LIBERTY: But you said you loved that house. Yeah, and I was a kid. LIBERTY: But love doesn't go away. HAVEN: You said you wanted to come back, you said-- Listen, kid, these letters you found, I wrote when I was ten years old. And I'm a grown woman now with my own house. I don't know you, and I don't know how you found me, which is slightly scary. But bottom line is, I can't help you, kid. -LIBERTY: Karina H., please! -Ms. Reena. -Did you call me today? -That was me. I'm only gonna tell you kids this once. Don't contact me, and don't come back here. ♪♪♪ Leave it alone, Carleigh. This is all your fault. What? CARLEIGH: You got our hopes up. You made us go searching for that woman. You made us believe that she was actually gonna save us. You made us look stupid. -I-- I didn't. -You did. What? I believed in you because you believed in Karina H. We followed her trails and her signs. For nothing. Now they're probably gonna split me and my brother up -because of you. -What about Lailah and Daisy? You didn't think about them. All you were thinking about was yourself. I didn't-- I didn't sell the house. I'm not the reason. HAVEN: Why did you even come here? Ever since you arrived, she didn't want us anymore. -Get out. -What? Get out! ♪♪♪ Liberty. Again? Honey, if you wanna stay in the bathroom, you should've said that. Come on, get up. Go on downstairs and find your friends. I got an announcement to make. You know I gotta get in here. [exhales] ♪♪♪ What's up? What happened? Why's everybody just sitting here like this? What's going on? Oh, good, you're here. Sit down. It's for all of you. I got great news! [singsong] We got a new buyer for the house! Nothing. Okay. Even better news, they want the house by the end of next week. Next week? What am I supposed to do? So glad you asked. Your last day here is next Friday. What about the kids, Kay? [sighs] If you wanna discuss this, my office hours are between nine and five. -It's ten. -MS. KAY: Okay. I just didn't wanna do this in front of their faces. No, they need to know what's going on. They need to know what's gonna happen to them. They're not new to this. This is not their first rodeo. Well, I mean, it is for this one. Yes, Miss Liberty and justice for all. What happens to us next Friday? Okay, so the people who dropped you off, they're gonna come back and pick you up, and then they're gonna drop you off somewhere that's not here. Yeah, me and you need to talk in your office. MS. KAY: Okay. Is this about your pay? I could pay through the month. I don't wanna leave again. Come on, Daisy. Let's start packing.

I don't know. This new job. I saw you on the TV in that high-powered suit. Looking sharp as ever, huh? Yeah, I-- I don't know. FATHER: Eh? What is it, baby girl? I don't know. It is a lot of money. And it is a good opportunity. I could be a junior partner in less than a year. The Vegas branch. Junior partner is good. Very. Sounds like everything you've ever wanted. Isn't it? Why am I not happy? Like, why do I feel like I didn't make the right decision? Girl... you didn't seem to like the last job you had either. But maybe law isn't for you. I'm sorry I couldn't take care of you before mom died. No, Dad. No, it's okay. Fought the courts like crazy to prove I can be a fit and capable father. Even selling the house on Crescent Street, the one we loved so much, to pay for all the lawyers. But as much as my mind wanted to take care of you... my body and sickness said otherwise. Sorry I couldn't be there for you when you needed me to be. You wanna hear something crazy? A group of kids came to my door and they said they followed our scavenger hunt, and it led 'em all the way to my doorstep. Can you believe that? It's been 25 years. -You got to be kidding. -[Reena chuckles] No. Uh-uh. [chuckles] -[father laughs] -REENA: Yeah. I remember you begging me to take you all over Vegas to leave them clues. -[father chuckles] -Mm-hmm. Hmm. 25 years. Can't believe it's lasted a lifetime. Well, Dad, you always told me everything happens for a reason. I hope you gave them a heck of a prize for finding you. ♪♪♪ I got to go, Dad. I'll be back. -You're coming back? -REENA: Yeah. Wait! Let me get out this bed. Bright and early, I see. I'm afraid I have to remove myself from the team. DR. PRICE: Uh, Reena, let's talk about this in my office. I'm sorry, but I don't have time. This has to happen now. Karina, think about your future here. Yes, and I have. And I'm making the choice to going back to working for the state, because there's a group of children who need me more than you do. Mrs. Hyatt, you have an ex-husband who honestly loves your daughter. And coming from a place where children are ripped from the only home they've ever known daily... you should consider yourself and your daughter extremely lucky. No one knows what tomorrow may bring, and there's children in the system who know that better than anybody else. So I implore you to do the right thing and allow your ex-husband to spend as much time with your daughter as he wants. I'm sorry, but I have to go. MS. KAY: All checked in. Where are your case, workers? I got a flight to catch. [door creaks] Finally! [laughs] Hey, what you doing here? I came so at least these kids know that somebody cares about 'em. Aww, that's so cute. You wanna take them with you? All right, here we go! Hey, who's caseworker are you? Mmm, funny thing, I'm nobody's. Okay, then, who are you? I'm the new owner of this house. It's just like I remember it. -MS. KAY: Remember it? -Yes, remember it. I grew up in this house. MS. KAY: Oh, honey, this house ain't that old. Cute. -Ms. Liberty. -Ms. Karina? MS. KAY: Karina? Hold up. I didn't sell this house to no Karina. I don't know what kind of game-- I bought the Smiths out. Oh. So how you know Liberty, hmm? I got a visit from these children last week. -MS. KAY: These kids? -Mm-hmm. These kids. -MR. PIERCE: The gold. -MS. KAY: Gold? What gold? REENA: You know, when the kids showed up to my doorstep last week, I honestly didn't even remember what they were talking about. It's been 25 years since I've seen that letter. -MS. KAY: What letter? -MR. PIERCE: The scavenger hunt. REENA: You know, I had to sit down with myself and remember what it felt like to be a kid, and I realized how rude I was to these kids who shared that same feelings that I once did. And I didn't know how to make it up to them. The only thing that I could think of was to honor their request. MS. KAY: Request? Yes. The kids asked me to save the house. Well, you may be able to save this house, but these kids are out of here. Mmm, right. That's another thing. I'm an attorney, and this house is zoned and listed as a home for youth, and I will not be changing that. -You must be Mr. Pierce. -I am. How would you like to run this house? I heard that you're on the market for a new job. I'd like that. Well, the social workers are on the way for these kids, so-- I can assure you they're not. And I owe each and every one of you an apology. Especially you, Liberty. You may have asked me to save this house, but you've done more for me than I could have ever done for you. And thank you for reminding me of what's important. -So we aren't leaving? -Nope. And you're not gonna split me and my brother up? -Nope. -And we're not gonna move? Nope. [Karina chuckles] We should apologize too. To who? -Liberty. -What happened? We haven't been the best friends we could. CARLEIGH: I was wrong. This wasn't your fault. It was never your fault. I was just afraid I was gonna lose my brother. It's okay. I was scared too. [Ms. Kay sniffles] Don't you have a flight to catch? [sniffles, clears throat] Uh, yeah. Okay. Uh, I think you can go.
