Yes, finally the 2016 Korea Drama Awards is here… Arrived in Korea for the awards… Korean dramas will no longer… Ko Joo Yeon is up for the Korean Drama Grand Prize. It's her first nomination for best supporting actress. - Do you think she'll win? - I think she still has a lot to work on. (Ko Joo Yeon, the foolish poor actress) Another dating scandal. Top star Ko Joo Yeon is reported to be dating baseball player K. Soccer player B says they’re just good friends… Reported to be dating movie director P… We're running out of alphabets. I'm sorry, can I pay you back tomorrow? Are you kidding me? (Kim Dan Ji, lower class middle school student) (Park Pyeung Goo, stylist) (Nominated for Best Supporting Actress) (Awards!) (JW Plastic Surgery) (Pregnancy Test) Does it look weird? He did it on purpose? Ah, yes! This is Alex. It's Pyeong Goo, Pyeong Goo… We were on our way to the awards, but Joo Yeon suddenly fell ill. We're going to have to stop by the hospital. Yes, I'm sorry… Yes. Geez, what am I going to do with you? How can you get a filler shot on the day of the awards? How can you go? Whatever! I don't even win money. You're driving me crazy. Sir, don't we also have another bottle of Johnny Walker? No, 2 bottles are fine. Sir, it's no time to discuss bottles. When we have an incident like this, you should call the right people and sort this out for us. I'm not a manager, why am I always… I mean, I'm a stylist. Yeah, I know. But you're good at doing this stuff. That's why you need to take care of it. Exactly. Oh my God. Really. Hey, did a lot of people see you at the salon? Were there a lot of people? I was wearing a mask. Why were you wearing a mask at a salon? That makes it weirder. Don't go outside. Don't go anywhere, just stay at home. You can't go outside, something bad will happen. What are we going to do with all your dresses? She played the character Lee Eui Jeong so attractively, and blew life into the play. She received a lot of love. - Congratulations. - Congratulations! - Don't eat that! - Now… We will announce the winner for best supporting actress. Lee Hyun, who do you want to win? They are all seniors that I respect so much, so I'd like all of them to win. Liar. Yes, the 2016 Korean Drama award for best supporting actress goes to… Please… Please. Lee Joo Ah from The Flower Next-door is Prettier.' - Congratulations. - Congratulations. Lee Joo Ah portrayed a tough Korean sausage and rice soup store owner in 'The Flower Next-door is Prettier,' and made the audience laugh and cry. Thank you, I never thought a day like this would every come. (Familyhood) Ma'am, congratulations on Ji Hoon's newcomer award. No, not at all, ma'am. It was all him, I didn't do anything… Ma'am, please speak comfortably with me. - Don't call me so formally. - No, I married early, but I'm around your age. I'm really thankful you look after him like your own, but please have him come in early. Yes, in fact today I'm going to get… - Hey, did you see Ko Joo Yeon? - I did. How old is she? I think I saw her since I was in pre-school. Is she a fossil? Her body's amazing though. Hey, she always goes after younger guys. She dated a lot of them, and got younger herself. How many did she help debut? Hey, and if she spends that much money on looking pretty, I could look like her too… What? It's all skill, girls. Work out hard. Doesn't it feel different? Did you shave? Ow, what? You said you'd mention me if you won the award. Why didn't you? When I got up there, my mind went blank. I'm sorry. Why aren't you wearing your ring? I forgot. Next time, I'll wear my ring and say confidently, 'Thank you Joo Yeon, my love.' You said it's your mother's birthday. Make sure to give her this. Thanks. How old was she when she got married? 20. Geez… Why are you concerned about that? Hey… My father wants to have a meal together. What? My father's a huge fan of yours. Go home, go! - I want to stay over and talk. - Go! Really, just go? Go. I love you. You're crazy, no you don't... I do, really. - Tae Ho! - Yes. Take him home quickly! - Safely! - Yes. I'm getting married. (Meals for Newly Married Couples) (Shin Saimdang) Director, we already decided that she'll take the Shin Saimdang role. I was drunk when I said that… Still, does a wife of a drunk make any sense? It's perfect for Ko Joo Yeon, the national fool. She's always involved in scandals with guys young enough to be her nephews. If she puts on a hanbok and wears a headpiece, she'll ruin the scenes. You should take care of yourself, too. You graduated from the New York Fashion School. What is left for you here? She's a niece of a CEO I know well. She'll help you out in many ways. You need to take some young kids under your wing. And help Joo Yeon get married as soon as possible. There's nothing sadder than a female actress once her popularity fades. What, Joo Yeon? Hey! Is she your friend? You're really out of bounds. Hey! When you were in the U.S...had no money, didn't I buy you food and drinks every day? Don't you remember? You sucked at English but wanted to make American friends so you slapped them in the butt as we do in Korea, and almost got expelled. I had to cover for you saying it's Korean tradition. And now you act like this? Huh? Yeah! I get to! So what? What's going on with you guys? You're both from the Marine Corps. You are? What year are you? 951. Why? What about you? That's not important. It's Joo Yeon! Joo Yeon! Joo Yeon's coming… (Shin Saimdang) Good morning! Oh? Director. Hey. Geez…what have you been eating? If you get prettier than you were before, how will the younger girls make it? That's their problem. I made sushi. Do you want some? No, I'm okay! Raise Pyeong Goo's wages. Looks like he has a lot of complaints. Hey, why? He's my best friend. I'm going to go, I have stuff to do. - You're just going to go? - Yes. - Goodbye! - See you. Why was he here? Did he want to make a request for Shin Saimdang directly? But I really thought about it, and I don't want that role. What? Ji Hoon will be the Yulgok Yi I. How can I play his mother? Oh, okay. Who's that? She's a girl I know. Just a girl I know. You're not using my money to raise and train some other actress, are you? Do you think I'm crazy? That's nonsense. What's that? You didn't eat, right? Did she eat? Ah, what should I do? What? Are there any decent restaurants that adults might like? Why? Ji Hoon's parents want to have a meal with me. So sudden… I wonder why? It's so much pressure. What do you mean why? It's that. - It is, right? - It is. What are you talking about? You helped the kid get a drama role, which gave him an award. It's the least they could do. Why do you keep calling him kid? You don't know what's going to happen! Geez. You have no eye for men… Yeah, at least you have someone. - Yeah, he's good enough. - Right. - Wow, that's spicy. - It is? Some of them might be spicy. Oh, Reporter Hwang! What's up? Ji Hoon? What about him? I'll check it out. What about Ji Hoon? No, just eat. Why? Nothing. Hey, Joo Yeon! It's… - What? - Hey, Joo Yeon! Hey, get out of the way! Take the phone… Joo Yeon! Ah, geez. Hey, take the phone away. Joo Yeon, wait a second. Wait… Joo Yeon… - Who is it? - Delivery. - How much is it? - 34,000 won. College student? Ko Joo Yeon? Leave. Yes. Ji Hoon. What? The card is not working? Ah, I lost again. A guy could do this. I'll understand. Thank you, really. Thanks so much for understanding. Of course, I'm experienced. If you're done fooling around, have her leave. I don't think you understand the situation? You're the one that should leave. Stay out of this. You stay out of this. You'll just look pathetic. He's mine. Geez, what's wrong with you? Hey, it's not good to be so naïve - when you're older. - He's mine. He's mine, okay? Mine! Uh… That… You're… complete trash. Don't do that drama. If you do, I'll really take you down. Ji Hoon. It's not even that surprising. I know enough by now. His parents wanted a meal with her. So what? That's what I said. Shouldn't you look for other jobs now? Big companies are calling for you. - Sang Mi. - Okay, got it. Mom… Hey, San, are you awake? Mom. Mom went to the supermarket, she'll be back soon. Play with me. Did he cry? It's fine. Mom will be back soon. Mom. Don't cry, she's coming. Mom. Mom. I'm tearing up. Who should eat this delicious rice? - Me? - Me, me, me! - Or San? - Me, me! - It's delicious. - Then give me a kiss. Kiss! - You're awake already? - Mom! - Kiss… - Where did you go? It's hot, go away. - No. - Fine. - Stop that. - I missed you. Laundry! - Go play with Auntie. - Let's play. Okay, go play with Auntie, okay? Come here, San! Let's play. No, I don't want to. She made you food, what's wrong? Her food doesn't taste good. Go sit down. I'm hot. She's going to set the house on fire. What should we do? She's going to set it on fire! Okay, let's eat. - Thank you. - Thank you! I really thought about it and I don't think there's a guy out there for me. Why are you being so negative? I thought about what I have left in my life. I really went through everything, and I have nothing. Sponsored bag, clothes, hair, plastic surgery, and cars. Does that make any sense? I went through so much to get where I'm at. And I don't have a single thing to call my own. I think you're taking it a bit too far. You have me, the CEO… Liar! All the CEO thinks about is training younger actors. And you, Pyeong Goo! Ultimately, you're on your kids', your wife's side, right? You don't have to be so… And Sang Nam is already 15 years old. When he dies, I'll bury him. But when I die all alone, who's going to bury me? - Geez… - So! I decided to really make something I can call my own. All mine. Someone that will never leave my side, and will love me. So your conclusion is? - I'm going to become a mom. - What? A mom with a child who's always on her side. Daughter, I want a daughter I like daughters. Blood type O! That sounds nice, right? Blood type O with parents who graduated from elite universities. Is that asking for too much? Then… a 4-year university? Are sons better? And… Does that make any sense? I'm not qualified? Me? There's not a single person in Korea who doesn't know who I am. What kind of qualifications do I need? You watch too many programs with kids these days. Stop it. Stop what? You're a father. How come I can't? What's wrong with me? Do you think you can pick children the way you pick out your clothes? You're so immature you can't be a mom… You do that at a temple. Do you think anyone can be a parent? It's not like that. You have to put your life on the line. Not everyone is cut out for it. I yelled too much, huh? Joo Yeon. So I should just have my own, right? I'll leave these fantastic genetics to the world. I'll do that. What? Why do you look like that? How long has it been since your last period? What? Hey. No way. Are you saying? I told you to come by often. Wow, geez. I told you so many times to be careful of guys. - I'll keep it. - Keep what? That idiot's kid? Genetically, he's alright! What's alright about him? The character of the mom and dad are very important. Don't you know that? Are you done talking? - It's not that… - Then what? You're going through menopause. Ah… What? Meno… Be careful. She's here again. - Mom. - I know. This is why young people are infertile. They're careless with their bodies. Geez. You're lucky. Hey. You shouldn't speak like that when someone's listening. Did I say anything wrong? Is that something an adult should say to a child? Whether she's able to have a baby or not did she harm you in any way? If you think your child is precious, you should consider others precious too! Hey it's not like she's your kid, right? She is! That's why I'm saying it! Let's go. How dare you go on like you know everything? Here. Don't be too grateful. I was just in a really bad mood today, so I went off. You're Ko Joo Yeon, right? No. I saw the article. He's a jerk. He looks alright, though. He's an idiot. You're like a real person. What? On TV, you don't seem like one. You look so happy. Do you know how hard it is to look happy? There are a lot of people who can't laugh even though they want to. How old are you? I'm old enough. Do you want to grab a bite? I have to do it today. Thanks for the ice cream. Yeah. What, she's here. Sure, take her. Is it healthy? - Is what? - The kid. Do you know how long we looked for you? I just talked to him so don't go. Stay put. Just don't move. She's on her way out again. - Hey. - I have to talk with a patient. Isn't it dangerous for you to get an abortion at such a young age? You… If you do this now, you have a higher chance of getting breast cancer later. I'll explain that to her so leave! What's wrong with you? Artificial termination of pregnancy is for people with genetic mental or physical diseases… I know this really well. You get rid of the baby now? You might not be able to have one later when you really want one. - So I should just have it? - What? Just have it? That's it? I'm not even grown up yet. How can I be so irresponsible and have this child? Will it grow up on its own? You can raise it well. If you have this baby, I'll raise it. An actress who bought a baby from a middle school student. This is a crime. When reporters hear this, it'll be really bad for you. Your days as an actress will be over. Why are you being so negative? She doesn't want it, and I do. If she has it and I raise it, it's good for both of us. Okay fine… Ignoring the fact that's illegal and immoral, what if something bad happens? What if you change your mind? I won't. Can't you see how much I want a baby? You won't change your mind? Really? You can't even wear the same pair of shoes for a week, right? Are children the same as shoes? You're acting just like how you do when you go to buy shoes. If you can't take responsibility, just leave it be, Joo Yeon. It's different this time. If I won't raise it, she'll really abort it. Do you know how dangerous it is to get an abortion when it's already that big? And what about that innocent child? Don't you feel sorry for it? Why is that your responsibility? How much do you know her? She's a pregnant middle school student. You have no idea how kids are these days So what, are you going to be my side forever? Yeah. Don't make me laugh. I'm not going to live like this anymore. Does it taste good? Yeah. Sister. My art teacher said if I win a prize at an art competition, I can go to an art high school. So what? Teacher said if I go to academies during vacation, and prepare really hard… Are you out of your mind? I'm pouring drinks for old men just to help us get by, and you're asking for money for art school? I'm saving money, too. You're wearing that blouse, right? Stop it, Kim Dam Ji. It's annoying enough that I have to live with you. Hi! Come here, eat. Yeah, I'm hungry. That's mine. You have it. You're representing the school at the art competition, right? Yeah. Did you tell her? The hospital? Do you want me to go with you? (Hanwul Middle School Grade 3 Class 3 Song Hyun Bin) (Celebration, Competing in the Junior World Golf Competition) Isn't that her? How should I know? What's wrong with her? What if she won't give me the baby? Then thank her for that. She's coming… Wangsimni 532-220. What? Put it in the navigation. You know it's dangerous to have a baby that young, right? (Total Amount: 100 million won) - Yeah, but still 100 million… - What? - Do you want me to get off? - What? No, no… Deposit the down payment, 5 million won into that account. - Okay. - And since it's vacation, I'll stay with you until I have the baby. - My house? - I'll find you a room. Yeah. How can strangers live together? Isn't this your baby? It is. A mother's voice is very important for the unborn baby. Don't you want prenatal education? Prenatal… I do. What, there's more? I can't have it in a hospital, so there are 2 ways. Have it at home with a witness and report the birth, or have it overseas. In case we do it overseas, we'll need a middleman. Reporting the birth… - Take a right here. - What? Okay… So are you going to do it or not? Of course I will. Hey, here… We're almost there… Is this right? She's smart. She's smarter than you. I mean geez… This is okay, right? It's a bit small, but it'll do. Thanks. Get out of the way. Don't jump on the bed. What are you going to do if she Why are you being so crude? Whatever. Hey, you. Middle school student, grade 3, class 2. I know where you live… Wangsimni 530… If you step out of line, I'll come get you. I'm a scary man. Leave! You're scary. - Look here. - Scary! - So scary. - I'll… I can even catch ghosts… Stop it! You inhumane man. There's no point in regretting. Are you sure you'll take responsibility? I will. Hey. Hey… Kim Dan Ji isn't coming home today. It's vacation, so she went somewhere with her friend. (Communicating with your infant raises IQ and EQ) Don't trust anybody. I don't trust anyone. The reason why I let you in my home isn't because I like you or I pity you. It's only about my child. My child's prenatal education. Those are rules you have to keep here. What you have to do for my child. And what you have to do after you have the baby. We shouldn't get too attached, so call me Miss Joo Yeon, okay? Yes, Miss Master. Miss Joo Yeon. Protein is good for developing immunity and growth. Plenty of rest, balanced nutrition, appropriate exercise, and most of all, your calm state of mind is very important for the baby, so relax. A long time ago, they didn't have air conditioning… Can't we watch something else? Think of him as the baby's father and have the baby listen to his voice. He's the only decent man in all of Korea. Thank you. So all I have to do is eat what I want and play like crazy? Like crazy… Speak properly and think good thoughts. Geez… this tastes like crap. Hey! You're not allowed to go outside. If you get caught, my career is over. If my career is over, you won't get a single penny. And your baby will be an orphan. (Ko Joo Yeon, Kim Dan Ji) You're not allowed in any other room in this house aside from yours. Geez. You have a nice life. Eat a lot. (Weight: 43.8) (Lunch time) I didn't leave any records or take any money, as you know. I'm just examining her, but don't think for a second that she can have the baby here. This is the last time we're meeting. Okay, got it. So how is the baby? Daughter? Legally I can tell you after 32 weeks. You can just tell me. Okay fine. But the baby is healthy? The baby's smaller than average. Why? I've been feeding her so well. Healthy foods. Yoga. Those are just basics. The mother can't be stressed. What do you want me to do? It might be because she's so young. Don't worry about it so much. If there's anything wrong with the baby, I'll make sure this place closes down! Don't come back! Ever again! Wow. This is delicious. But, Miss Joo Yeon, don't you work? I'm pregnant, so I don't work. You're not getting casted are you? This world has 3 types of actors. First, actors who wait to get casted. Second, actors who select roles. Third, actors who create roles. Which one are you? The third type, of course. Nobody our age knows who you are. Who watches dramas for the woman anyway? Only women watch TV dramas. Have you heard of Shin Saimdang? 50,000 won. The director for the special 50th anniversary historical drama Shin Saimdang came to my office himself to offer me the role. But I declined. This? (National Younger Brother Kang Ji Hoon, prepares to become Yulgok Yi I!) This idiot. What's the point of having a good image? You need to make more when you can. He wants to have a go at me, does he? Follow me. What? - Hello. - Hey! Long time. I've been watching you, you're getting better. - Hello. - Hi, Seok Kyu. I heard you stole something in Macao. Exactly the same. - Hello. - Hi. How are you doing, Joo Hyun? Let's grab a drink sometime. Hello. (Queen of Crime) (Mini series for Mondays and Tuesdays, first broadcast on May 9) Director, we need to work together. Of course. Oh? It's the dad. The baby's dad is walking by. He's short. I'm going to get an autograph. Excuse me, please give me an autograph. Hello. - I'm a fan. - Oh dear. It's okay, are you okay? The woman is on top of her husband's head, shaking his top knot. What do we… I'm sorry, I'm late, right? Oh? Hello, ma'am. Hello. I must have lost my mind for a moment. You even came by my office. I know it wasn't an easy decision. Thank you. You're like a real actress now. Thank you. Okay, let's finish the reading, and go grab a drink. - Okay. - Yes, let's start from scene 5. Scene 5, dark night. Shin Saimdang is staring at Lee Won Soo, her husband, who is hiding behind the uncle's back. Passing state exams are important, but you aren't a virtuous or devoted daughter. How can you treat your father so coldly, who missed you so? If he is as weak as his father, and just as incapable, I will go to the mountains as a Buddhist nun. Or, I will even end my own life and leave this world. Look, see this… I… I'm going to go to the bathroom. - Hello. - Yes? Hello. (Shin Saimdang) Oh dear, Miss Joo Yeon. Miss Joo Yeon. Miss Joo Yeon. What is she doing? Miss Joo Yeon! I'm not going to book! I'm not going to! No booking. Ah, geez… When did you learn how to do that? I had to eat. Yeah, people need skills. I was picked to represent my school at an art competition. Representative? Does that mean you're going to compete? How can I like this? You were right. You're an actor that creates roles. You promoted yourself from Mrs. Kwon to Shin Saimdang. - Do you want to die? - Don't move! I'm almost done, don't ruin it. But Miss Joo Yeon, why don't you live with your mom? She died when I was 20. Dad? I've never met him. You? Similar situation. I wasn't that sad when it happened because I was young, but it's sadder as time passes. Mm. - I miss her more. - Mm. When other kids complain about their moms and dads, I pretend to listen but I'm really jealous. I thought like that, too. Hey… you're different from me. You're very bright. Hey, you, you're alright yourself. Smart, skilled, good with money, and pretty enough. But you have to be careful of guys. Don't laugh, I'm serious. Women need to meet the right man. If you ever meet a guy, call me first. Got it? I got it but do you have the right to tell me that? That idiot. Revenge… shouldn't you take it? It's Ko Joo Yeon! Ko Joo Yeon! - Ko Joo Yeon! - One moment. Ko Joo Yeon, give me a moment. - Ko Joo Yeon! - One moment. Is it true that you're pregnant? - Please tell us. - Is it true? - Please look here. - Just 1 statement. Yes, I'm pregnant. I thought it was my last chance so… I decided to keep it. Are you going to say who the father is? Ko Joo Yeon! Just one word… (Ko Joo Yeon is 2 months pregnant) Top star Ko Joo Yeon has announced that she is pregnant! The internet is rampant with speculations about who the father is, and real time searches related to Ko Joo Yeon is battling for the first and second spots, garnering public interest. Everyone is wondering about what she will do next. The CEO is in the hospital. My goodness, where? You don't say 'where' in this situation, you ask why is he sick. Are you going to keep doing this until I pop a blood vessel and faint? It's not like I'm going to raise the child hidden from the world. How do you know if the child will be born, whether your mind will change, or her mind will change? My mind won't change. Ever. Who do you think I am? What are you going to do with the commercials we are contracted? That one commercial? I don't know. Right now, my life is more important than commercials. Hey! Is this just about you? It's about your life, my life, and the life of my family. I know, I do… But what? How can you act this way? How are you still so immature? You told me to stay this way. You said actors need to stay immature or their careers will be over! Mature! You need to be more mature. I think actors need to mature. Don't go outside and just stay in until things calm down. Stay in. Got it? You need to eat some more. Anything you want? Should I not have said anything? No way, I feel so much better. You use the internet, right? Add some comments. That'll show them. I have been. You should too. Get revenge. I'm fine. Why? Still like him? Did you tell him you were pregnant? - I did. - And? He stole his mom's ring and gave it to me? Crazy kid… To pay for the abortion? And he asked me if it was his. Wow, that jerk. It's not like I'm any better. Did you commit some deadly sin? He's the bad guy who doesn't know how precious a woman's body is and is being irresponsible. You didn't do anything wrong. Then why am I the only one suffering? You're just a bit early, that's all. Sure it's hard now. But look at me, I'm fine. What's there to life anyway? It's short. We shouldn't feel down. It's easier to live life blaming others. Let it out, don't keep it all in. He's going to the U.S. today. As a representative of Korea. (3 New Messages, Check Information?) (Is that him?) (I just want to go!) (Hey! Just let him go? You're in love aren't you?) (Then what do I do?) (He's coming, he's coming, he's coming) Why are you… (Hit him) It's your kid. What? It's your kid. Let's talk about this later. Why would we meet again? Good luck on your competition. Your baby's going to watch you on the field. Every. Hole. Bin, we're taking photos. What are you doing there? - Hello. - Oh? Are you Bin's friend? I came to congratulate him. Thank you so much for coming all the way here. Can I take the picture with you? Of course! Hurry up. Ah, and this… Bin gave this to me. Okay! Let's take the picture. Look here. 1, 2, 3. Hey, you… You're a lot better than I thought? What's he going to do? That picture's going to last forever. I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for you. Thank you. Hey. Just call me Big Sis from now on. You've earned it. Say it. Try it out. Big Sis. - Hey! - Yeah. - Where are you? - Why? How are you feeling? I'm sorry I didn't tell you what I was going to do. But I couldn't keep it a secret until the baby was born. No one knows how life will turn out. Right? I always thought I'd end up just fooling around with younger guys. You think a baby even crossed my mind? I tried so hard to make you change your image, and nothing worked before. What? I know you never ever considered this before doing what you did, but geez. Look at this. Come on, hurry. Take a look. Oh my. Oh my, what is this? Oh my… That baby is a blessing. - You're not a Miss anymore. - What? - You're going to do it, right? - What? Formula, baby products, all of it. Of course! Yes, of course! I'll do it! All of it! What can't a mother do? Of course! Let's make some money. - Let's make money. - Make money! - Make money! - Make money! - Let's make money! - Let's do it! - Make money! - How many are there? (Ko Joo Yeon) - Cut, okay? - Okay? - Great job. - Great job! Great job. - Mrs. Kwon? - Shin Saimdang! I'll think about it. The director and main cast of Shin Saimdang are going on stage. How did you cast the roles? Honestly, in my head, there was only one person for the role. Our passionate actress, Ko Joo Yeon. The scandals of Ko Joo Yeon's pregnancy and with Kang Ji Hoon is garnering public interest. I think it took a lot of consideration to decide on the role. If this scandal was true, we wouldn't be sitting next to each other like this. - That jerk… - Look at him… Right, Joo Yeon? Don't hold the mike, don't do it! I thought about it a lot. Don't think about anything. I don't think there's any reason for me not to sit next to my baby's father. What did I do wrong? Isn't that right? - Wow, that looks good. - Wow! With a mother's heart, mother's ramen. - Cut! We'll check the monitor. - Yes. Hey, Park! I just talked with Brad… Okay, great job. I finished talking with Brad. Okay, thanks. - Hey wait… - What? Her makeup isn't staying on. What primer did you use? I told you to use banila co. Fancy brands aren't all good. It's fine. - They're all the same. - Fine. Let's erase the make-up on our way. I'm tired. Chanel, Hermes all want you to wear them. - Ah, my stomach hurts. - Hey! How many did I eat? People are watching, be careful. Don't you have anything cool? I keep getting heat rashes. Think about how hard it is for pregnant mothers. Hey, I think the baby's a blessing. My wife went to go see a fortune teller. A nobleman will appear from the East and open doors for you. She's from Wangsimni. Is Wangsimni east? It probably is, right? Can you just keep going out like this? I snuck out. Your stomach is getting bigger. Is Ko Joo Yeon good to you? She's hot these days. She made me really annoyed at first, but now it's comfortable. Are her boobs really that big? You're relationship's over once you have the baby, so don't get attached. It probably will be, right? Of course! She's more volatile than a middle school student. She's not always like that. She's bright. Ok-hee! Hey! Did you know? I went to a few academies. If you draw better than me, you're really good. I'm going. Hey, don't get attached! (Weight 44.6) (Edema 28.3) We have a special guest at the studio today. She's receiving public support through her brave announcement. It's actress Ko Joo Yeon. Hello. Hello! I'm Ko Joo Yeon. You should be used to the camera, but you look nervous. It's my first time on the news. It's making me very nervous. It's the same as a drama camera. - Relax. - Yes. - She got her wish. - Your recent news on becoming a single mother is really impacting our society. Yes. - That must've been hard for you. - Yes. How did you have the courage? In our society, having a baby, without a father is considered a messy private life? No. There is a social bias that it's promiscuous behavior, yes? Yes! Promiscuous, yes. Socially, it seems reproachable, and people tend to glare. It's not just the woman's fault, but women become discouraged? - Yes, it seems that way. - Yes… Stupid. (Chances of getting pregnant while wearing a condom) - I'll take that. - Yes. - Great job. - Good job. You're so ignorant, it's embarrassing. Let's go. Do you want to die? I'm so annoyed. Ah, good news! Ji Hoon's out of Shin Saimdang, and his CEO is after him for penalties. Could you take a picture? - I'm sorry. - Ah, yes! - Come here. - Just take it… Make sure we look good. I'll take it, 1, 2, 3. - Thank you. - Good job. - Good job. - Great job. - Please post a good one on SNS. - Yes. - Ah, wait. - Here's the microphone… Could you turn the light back on? Could you take one with me? Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, did you see? Did you see me? I did. He was sitting right there. He's really different. He's really something… You know what else? He wants to have a meal with me! What's the big deal about a meal? Hey! The national anchor wants to have a meal with me. It's an honor. The baby can hear his voice. I'm the one that's pregnant, okay? You still like men after what you've been through? Did I say I'm going to do anything with him? I'm pregnant too, okay? Publically. I just wanted to share, can't you just accept it? - Want me to do your nails? - No. You're tired, go to sleep. I went to the hospital and then I came to the hamburger joint you talked about. Yes, okay. I'll take care of it. Why aren't you eating? You're close with her? Not really? We just know a lot about each other. She didn't say anything about you. Why would she tell you? She talks about you, though. What does she say? That you're a blessing. I… You seem close with the man with you the other day. Are you… - Who? - The big guy… Ah! He's my best friend. - Ah, I see. - He's my stylist. We worked together for so long, so people tend to misunderstand. Did you… - misunderstand? - No, no… - You're a real person. - What? On the news, you sit like a robot and speak so eloquently. You didn't seem like a real person. Like you wouldn't even poop. Ah, I'm sorry. - Let's eat. - Okay. Is it a girl? Don't I look a bit older? Yeah, you do! You are old. Hey! My butt. What are you doing here? I think it's a girl. - Ah! My stomach. - Right. I think it's a girl. How do you know? I had a dream, and a peach… I don't care if it's a girl or boy. Ah, I'm late again! I'll be back. Take this and eat whatever you want. Take it. (Good morning?) (Are you free this weekend?) - Ah, really. - Ah, what? - Here. - What is it? It's a cellphone! Give it to Dan Ji. I got it with your card. It's from you. Okay. - Ah, geez! - What? Pay more attention to Dan Ji. She's pregnant and alone. It must be hard for her. What about me? Isn't life hard for me? She's in middle school! Grade 3! You're middle-aged! You were so focused on prenatal education in the beginning. Does it seem like I have time for that? And I need to raise the baby soon. I need to make my money while I can. Ah, really. Ah, got it. It stings. I got it. Geez, really. How's your art competition prep going? What competition? People need skills. How can I go like this? Tell the teacher for me. Hey. You scared me. How are you? My Sang Nam. It's the first time I heard she has a niece? When is she getting in? I'm on my way, stay in your room. How can you let him in? He just went in, what could I do? Is that her? Give that to me. I'm not a bad person. I just have something to tell her. - Let me go! - Really. - Let go! - Just once… What are you doing here? Go in your room. It's not mine, right? We used condoms. Can't you just tell me it isn't mine? Did I commit some deadly sin? I just cheated once, aren't you being too harsh? We were just dating! For me, that was the last time. Joo Yeon. I love you. Let's start over. Liar. Joo Yeon. Please. Get out of here. Geez, really! Don't come closer, I'll call the police. I don't have anything to lose. Let's see how far this goes. I don't care if she's young. Does she think at all? Stop it. The contract said not to go out alone. Try that again, I dare you! Okay? Stop it! She was just feeling cooped up. So what! Huh? Okay, okay… Big Sis, ice cream! These are braised beef ribs. These are pumpkin pancakes. These are all good for pregnant women. Heat it up whenever you're hungry. Are you constipated? Pregnant women usually are. You fart often, right? Ah. This is carp juice. It's good for pregnant women. So make sure you drink it. Okay? Now eat. Here… Ah, and… This… You don't have pregnancy clothes that fit you well, so I made one. I measured you by eye, so I'm not sure if it'll fit you well. Try it out later. Yeah… it's hard on your own, right? Joo Yeon's so busy all of a sudden. She's not a bad person. Please understand. Is she dating Joo Min Ho these days? It's not like that. Really, that's not why she's not more attentive. She's just a bit immature. I've known her for over 20 years… She's always been… Just please understand. There's a lot I need to understand when it comes to her. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah. I'm going to borrow this today. Why did you bring so much stuff here when you have your own room? Isn't it the baby's room? Where are you going? I have an appointment. We were supposed to go to the hospital together. How are you going to raise the baby later when you're so busy? I forgot. Let's go together later. I'm sorry. I thought I had a spare, but I don't. It's yours, Miss Joo Yeon anyway. Why are you calling me Miss Joo Yeon? The baby's coming soon. Better not to get attached. (Lunch Time) What is that? Oh? This is… The baby's head, the baby's hand, feet, and this is the baby's heart. This is the baby's heartbeat. Can't you turn it off? What? Sure… What are those guys doing? Why are you here alone? I can't get an abortion now, right? What? Ah, that's hot… Please wait, it's almost done. (Gynecology Deok Soo) - Hey, what? - Yeah. Did something happen with Dan Ji? Why? She said something strange today. What did she say? If… - she can get an abortion now. - What? And I didn't tell her this, but the location of the baby isn't so great. What does that mean? We have to see, it's nothing serious, but take care of Dan Ji. Don't have her come alone. Joo Yeon! Let's eat. Let's talk later. (You're giving up on the art competition? - Ok Hee) You're not Ko Joo Yeon's niece, are you? Tell me your mom's phone number. Hurry. Top Star K is under suspicion of announcing a false pregnancy… Oh my gosh, honey! Honey! Wake up. - What do we do? - What? I'm tired. - Wake up! - I don't have work today. Joo Yeon! What do we do? What about her? The neighbors didn't know about her, as she did not go outside of the Seoul Pyongchang-dong villa where K lives. I'm watching. - Where's Dan Ji? - Dan Ji… Her agency has yet to respond. She's not home. What? Didn't you say you went to the hospital with her? I was going to give all the money to you. Pay our debts, that's why I did it. I'm sorry. Who said you did anything wrong? Yeah, we can get at least a million out of this. Let's not do this. We can get more money. Why not? You can even do art. I'm sorry, that's why. Let's not do this to Joo Yeon. That money's enough. Shut up, you're annoying me. She was really good to me. Really good. We can't do this to her. She's a really good person. Stop the car. Get out. Get out. If you like her so much, get out, okay? Sis… She's going to live with you forever? She's going to take care of you? If you like her so much, go. Hurry up and make your choice. (Star Today Reporter Ko Bong Keon) Dan Ji. Dan Ji, are you okay? So you made her pregnant, and now you want her baby? What do you mean we made her pregnant? We met her after she was pregnant. So you tricked an innocent child and told her to sell her baby. That's not what we did… Met in an elevator for the first time July 12. Locked her in the Pyongchang-dong house after taking her in a van July 19. We have it all down. Don't lie. Locked her in? What are you… Did you think you could solve this with money? You're really bold, aren't you? How did you know she was an orphan? Don't threaten… Kim Dan Ji. Is that what you told them? How else would we have known? Talk to me. Okay? Take Joo Yeon and leave. Joo Yeon, let's go inside. Why are you just standing there? Say something. Did you say that to them? Why aren't you talking? Joo Yeon, wait… Is this what you were planning to do from the start? How could you do this to me? Why? That wasn't enough money? Why should I stop here? She's only Ko Joo Yeon. What can she did if I threaten her and take more of her money? No one will believe her or trust her, anyway. She's just a wounded, national fool, Ko Joo Yeon! You're crying? Why are you crying? Shouldn't that be me? Why did you talk me into this? You won't even be responsible for it. It's all because of you! I'm sure you felt pressured from all the bad comments and being cast out from your drama role. How do you feel now? I had a hard time because of the false rumors, but I'm planning to give my all for the drama. Is there anything you want to say to Ko Joo Yeon? I want to say thank you to my family for believing in me. - Ji Hoon. - Thank you. This case can be likened to the Ripley Syndrome, where a famous person fears losing the spotlight, and ends up lying repetitively. You'll congratulate me, right? It's a type of… She's really something. How can she think of hiding that? She must have a mental illness. What normal person would do that? Geez. The CF penalties alone are 2 billion. If you sell this house, it'll cover it. Pyeong Goo went to Ji Hoon and begged on his knees. We avoided a lawsuit. (Memorandum of Agreement) I'm sorry. When your mother passed away, she asked me to take care of you. I wondered how many bad people there are in this world for her to depend on a guy like me. It was surprising, a lot of pressure and a bit sad. It's been 20 years for us, right? We fended well in this chaos. And to avoid a lawsuit, you have to apologize publicly yourself. Okay, let's eat. - Thank you. - Sure. Well, everything's settled, so, - let's toast. - Sure. Cheers. We're lucky it's just come to this. Good job. Are a lot of places calling for you? You can go there. Joo Yeon. What? What did I do wrong now? I spent everything I learned to protect us. Why are you looking at me like a criminal? What did any of us do wrong? - What? - This is punishment. Sang Mi, stop it. How dare you yell at these people? These people begged on their knees to cover for you and your fickleness. Okay, fine, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for always being the fool. Thank you. That's why I went out this morning in the rain for groceries and slaved away in front of that hot stove for you. Who said anyone wanted to eat this? You think this is caring, right? When you're in a good mood, you go out with young guys to expensive restaurants and clubs. But when something bad happens you don't want to be alone, so you say you'll make us a meal and have us come over. All the while saying "No one is on my side…" Have you ever been on anyone's side? If you don't want to eat, leave. If you didn't want to come, you shouldn't have. Kang, San, let's go! Come. Hey, Sang Mi. I'm being perfectly clear. I've never made anyone come. If you want to leave, go. Hey, Mi Rae. I'm leaving, too. That wasn't all of your money. Pyeong Goo, Mi Rae, and I all worked hard for that money. What? Why aren't you leaving? Geez, Ko Joo Yeon. Really. Don't cry too much. The rainy season started today. After a long drought, this is welcome. Please remember to take your umbrella on your way to work. We are always on your side. Thank you. Did you take care of everything? Yes. What will you do now? With my driving skills, who'd take me? I'm going to go back home. This isn't much, but take it. You'll need it. Great job. Thank you. Geez… Do you think Dan Ji really did that on purpose? She never used the credit card you gave her. Yes, hello. - I'm Dan Ji's friend. - What? I need to tell you something. Dan Ji left home. Dan Ji's sister gave her some money, and went to Australia with her boyfriend. Can't you help Dan Ji out? We want to help her, but legally there is nothing else we can do. I'm sorry. Be careful… (Art Competition Type C) (Ko Joo Yeon) (I'm scared) I'm scared. I'm scared. I think it's a girl. Ah, my stomach! I'll be back. I'm going to borrow this today. We were supposed to go to the hospital together. Let's go together later. I'm scared. (I'm scared) It moved today. The contract said not to go out alone. Try that again, I dare you! Okay? Why are you crying? Shouldn't that be me? You won't even be responsible for it. It's all because of you! (Esther's House) You're going to the art competition? Dan Ji, but if you go like this - people will… - If I need a guardian's signature, I'll get it later. (Adoption Consent Form) (Parent: Kim Dan Ji, Guardian: Kim Seon Yeong) I told you. You might change your mind so decide slowly… I'm not stupid. I'm young, uneducated, and no adult will help me. I have no right to be a mother. I'm leaving my baby to live my life, so I'm going to work hard. (Press Conference for Ko Joo Yeon's Official Apology) Pyeong Goo. You know where Dan Ji is, don't you? I want to apologize to her first Joo Yeon. I didn't do anything for her. It's my last request, Pyeong Goo. (Esther's House) Why is she here? Where is Dan Ji? Hey, Joo Yeon! Ko Joo Yeon! Really… where are you going to go? Are you going to keep being like this? If you don't go to that press conference your life will be over. She got into a traffic accident, and will be a little late. Is she going to apologize or not? I'm sorry, please wait a little longer. It's not about that, you called all of the reporters here. What are you doing? Students will move to the second floor AV room. (CEO) - Hey! - Hey! Where are you? CEO, we came to Dan Ji. What are you talking about? If you do this, it's over for everyone. Don't you know that? I do. But sir… The national fool Ko Joo Yeon is right this time. Sir, please, just block this for us this time. I'm begging you. I'm sorry. One more time. The exam is about to begin, so students who will participate… (37th National Art Competition for Middle and High School Students) What are you doing there? Go inside. Big Sis… Let's go. We need to register. Registration form. Ko Joo Yeon, Ko Joo Yeon… - She's crazy. - Why is she here? Good lucky. You can't be here. Why? It's a school event, and all of Korea's students will be here today. She'll just draw and leave. It's not about that, it's her condition… What about her condition? - Ko Joo Yeon. - Yes? What is your relationship with the student? I'm her guardian. The competition will begin. Students… Excuse me, you need to go back. We don't have anywhere else to go. You know you can't do this, right? Sir, it's my business so back off. Just let her draw and leave. You think because you're a celebrity you can do whatever you want? Yeah, really… Think of all the work we put in preparing for this competition. She worked hard for it, too. Just let her draw, what's the problem? - You're too much. - What are you doing? - You're bothering the students. - Yeah… I'll call the reporters! Reporters? I have to go see them anyway. Nice timing. Call them. My life hit rock bottom anyway. I'm not afraid of reporters. Call them! Call all of them! Where do you think you are? Why are you making such a racket? I don't want to. I just want her to draw… What are you doing at a school? A pregnant girl is nothing to be proud of. Ah, who said it is? These are innocent kids who just draw really hard. So don't make any more noise and just leave. Have you no shame? What's there to be shameful about? What did we do wrong? What's the difference between her and the students inside? It's just her stomach. You're so brazen, aren't you… Sure, she did it early. So what? She must have had her reasons. But. The boy who did this to her is representing Korea in the U.S. But how come she… How come she can't enter this competition? Why are you crying? Don't cry. These adults are too much. So what? So she can't do anything else with her life now? We're so embarrassed, and we wanted to give up everything. But we really mustered up the courage to come here. Just once. Can't you just give her a chance? Please. Don't cry. Do well, okay? Guardian, please wait outside. Yes, sorry! I'm sorry. Sorry. (Breaking News] Ko Joo Yeon fails to appear at the press conference) I'm sorry. (Ko Joo Yeon Official Press Conference) Ko Joo Yeon, please come out. - Ko Joo Yeon! - Ko Joo Yeon! Ko Joo Yeon! Get out of the way! Is Kim Dan Ji's guardian here? The mother is refusing anesthesia, so we can't perform the operation. We need you to come in. Dan Ji, right now… you need surgery. The baby isn't doing so well. Everything's going to be fine. You just have to fall asleep for a little bit. You can do it, right Dan Ji? All I thought about was how great it would be to get all that money. All I did was hate and try to get rid of the baby. - And you… - No, Dan Ji! It's not. It's not because of you. It's me. Big Sis, I'm sorry. Can you be the baby's mother? My baby, I can't send it to someone I don't know. I won't send our baby anywhere. I'll hold on to the baby. Okay? And do you know what your taemong means? Your baby will make their own fortune. My life is over. I'm a grandmother at 42. Life is hard. Indie film directors don't pay you. Dan Ji changed her dreams 10 times. - I'll go again. - Bad girl. - Bye. - But, it's strange. - Big Sis! - Really strange. Whenever I see him, I feel stronger. Is our baby here? - I don't like me either. - What's that? Hairy monster? Oh, did you? Oh, you did… Who did that? Okay… How can we… I like romance. Ah, yes. Like this, look. - Dad. - Okay. CEO, we don't have the foreign liquor that you like. This will do. - Did you hear? - What? Dan Ji. She has a boyfriend. - What! - That girl. She doesn't study. I am studying. She says she is, leave her be. - Let's eat! - Oh! Glass noodles. I dare you to fail exams again! I'll stop paying for your academy. They're not related, but it's strange they both like men, right? I quit men a long time ago, okay? So is anchor Joo Min Ho a woman? He's just a friend! Friend… The friend is here. Let's eat. Come here! Oh my! Kang, Sang, mom's glass noodles! Mom's glass noodles. Look at her pretending to be cute. Wow. Hey, are you crazy? I just tried it out. - No, this… - Nice job. Did someone put barley tea in this? Who? - Kim Dan Ji, you… - Yeah? You? Ah, I did that! Me… You're out of your mind, really… I drank it and it was bland so I put some in. I thought this was alcohol. What did you pour in? Ah geez! It's halfway gone! This tastes like alcohol. - Ah, I'm hungry. - The guest is here. Only me! - Deok Soo, eat a lot. - Yes. Hey, go eat over there.
