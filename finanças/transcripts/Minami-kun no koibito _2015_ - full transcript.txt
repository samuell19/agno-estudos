- I'll leave Horikiri-shi in your care. Okay. By the way, When I looked into "The Legend of One-Inch Princess", I found out that using the lucky mallet is not enough. What? In the original story, after the One-inch Princess used the mallet, she prayed, facing the morning sun, at Akebono Cape and she became big. Akebono Cape? Why don't you go? Please, make me big, and return me to my original self. Please return Chiyomi to her original self. The day has finally come when I can return to my original self. Where are you, Chiyomi? Right here! I am here, Minami-kun! Ever since Minami-kun, who I've liked since when I was little, has rescued me, I've felt happiness being close to the person I like, and sadness... The Minami-kun that I like is not a coward like that. You can't do anything without me. Your fever is going up. Being impatient with myself for not being able to do a thing. Being disappointed at myself... A lot happened. - That you really like Chobiko... - I like Chiyomi. It's not one sided-love. You are... already a part of me. Minami-kun... I finally found out that Minami-kun was feeling the same way. Now, our feelings became one. I want to get back to how I was... for Minami-kun. ~Last Episode~Good bye Chiyomi, Good bye Minami-kun Why? Am I going to stay like this forever? Don't worry. I'm sure there is another way. But... what else can we do? Don't worry. I'm here with you. Minami-kun... But, that Takagi... he was so confident, but what is this? Thank you very much. Thank you for taking care of me during my stay. Thank you very much. Well... Since we came all the way out here, shall we skip school for a day and stay one more night somewhere? He's not heading back now, is he? I'll Leave Horikiri-shi in your care. Okay. In the original story, after the One-inch Princess used the mallet, she prayed, facing the morning sun, at Akebono Cape and she became big. Akebono Cape? Why don't you go? Those two are definitely seeing each other. Somewhere, they will meet up. Chiyomi, is there any place you want to go? Yeah. Where? Where do you want to go? Please take me home. Home? Not Minami-kun's house, but my house. Chiyomi? I'm going to tell my parents about what's been going on. Wait a minute. It's not like you can't get back to normal forever. I can't continue to be your burden like this forever. It's okay with me. I don't think of it as a burden. Minami-kun... Minami-kun is talking to himself all this time. Is he okay? Let's forget about each other when we get home. Everything up until now... let's forget about them. What are you saying? I can't possibly do that. You can't become happy being with me like this. There's nothing I can do for you. Don't worry about that. I'm saying it's okay. I don't like it. I don't want to live being a burden to you. Minami-kun, you will someday regret it. I'll regret more if I'm not with you. I... no matter how you are, I will protect you. And I won't leave your side. Minami-kun... I love you. Let's stay together forever. I'm sorry. Let's end this.

Shut up! I don't know! What are you guys doing? Let's go. Hurry up and get in the car. Minami-kun. Minami-kun! Hey... Minami-kun. Hey, Minami-kun! Minami-kun. Minami-kun... Minami-kun, are you okay? Minami-kun! Hey, Minami-kun! Minami-kun! Ch, Chiyomi? Mom... Mom... Minami-kun is... Maybe Onee-chan (big sister) did really turn into a dwarf. Mom! Minami-kun is not moving! What should we do? - Chiyomi, calm down.- What should we do? There's nothing you can do right now. Let's calm down first... Hello? There was an accident. Please come quickly. [Nomura Hospital] [Operating Room] Doctor, how is Shunichi? How is he doing? The surgery was a success. We removed the bleeding in the brain. There were no other damages, so all we have to do is wait for him to regain his consciousness. I'm sure there will be no aftereffect either. Dr. Kawamura, thank you so much. Thank you. So he was Minami-san's child. Since he is young, I'm sure he'll recover quickly. Thank you very much. Excuse me. Thank you very much. That's great. Minami-kun... Thank goodness... Here we are. I'm home. Hey, where is Chiyomi? - She's in here.- Here? Dad, I'm home. I'm sorry to have made you worry for a long time. Chi...Chi...Chi...Chi... I'm Chiyomi. What~~~~!!!! I see. Asuka, why didn't you tell us if you knew? I did tell you. I said she might have become a tiny person. That sounded like a joke. You wouldn't have believed me if I told you anyway. - But, even so...- It's alright now. She came home safely like this. Dad... Hey, you are so small and cute. Welcome home, Chiyomi. Welcome home. I'm so happy for you. I'm home. He's been asleep this whole time. He just had the surgery yesterday... This is to be expected? It's strange. The anesthesia has worn off a long time ago. He should be awake by now. Eh? So cute. Chiyomi. - Chiyomi.- What's the matter, Mom? Minami-kun hasn't regained consciousness yet. What? My Little LoverMinami Kun No Koibito Dad... What went wrong? Ricchan, thank you (for coming). Minami-kun... What's going on? He should be awake by now. I was told that it is clearly not normal for him to be in a coma for a long time like this. But, wasn't he recovering nicely? There is a chance that he wouldn't regain consciousness. No way...! Dad! Minami-san, the doctor wants to talk to you about our plans going forward. Okay. Ricchan, may I ask you to (stay here) for a while? - I am going, too.- Me, too. Minami-kun... Mom. Hmm? Would you leave us alone for a little bit? Okay. Minami-kun. Wake up. Wake up... please. I'm sorry, Minami-kun... I was only thinking about myself. Even if I couldn't get back to how I used to be, I would have been happy just to be beside you. I will never leave you. Even if you didn't wake up. I love you, Minami-kun. Let's stay together forever. Minami-kun... Minami-kun! Chiyomi... Yeah, I'm Chiyomi. Do you recognize me? You were safe... Minami-kun. I'm so relieved. I'm so happy. Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Little Lover Team @Viki Chiyomi. Minami-kun. Minami-kun, I... Chiyomi? Yes, Minami-kun. - Chiyomi.-Yes. - Chiyomi.- Yes. Can you wear something? Don't look! - Not yet!- I won't look. It's okay now. I can't believe... a kiss really worked... I wonder if a prince's kiss would return me to my original size. There is no way that would work. My goodness. Holding back (a kiss) backfired. What?

Next one up is Ueno Yuka-san, a freshman in the dance club, who is going to be the next leader. She wrote a song for the two. Please enjoy. Yay, we can listen to Yuka-rin's song.

I forgot to pack sweatpants and shoes. What do you think you are going there for? Minami-kun successfully entered a medical university where he could commute from home. He became a medical student in April this year. I moved to Minami-kun's house. Well, I just moved to our neighbor's house though. We've been having a sweet married-life. It will be so hard for me to be away from you for two weeks. Well, I sure will feel that way. But, today, I am going to Tokyo to participate in the dance workshop I was supposed to go to last year. This time, you will work hard to become a dancing writer, right? After I finish writing this, I'll be going. Are you about to finish it? It is getting to the best part of the story now. The best part? The big guy took Chobiko to a place. The place was... Be careful. Wow, this place brings back memories. It seems as if it happened a long time ago. Yeah. It makes me remember the time when I became small. Is that all you remember? What? It is not a well-made crown, but... Chiyomi... I love you. I want you to stay with me forever. Let's get married. When she put her face on the big guy's chest, She heard his heartbeat she used to listen to. Chiyomi, look. The two kept looking at the rainbow for a long time. That was the same kind of rainbow that they saw when they were kids. That rainbow might have been our future. Chobiko is not in a pocket anymore.
