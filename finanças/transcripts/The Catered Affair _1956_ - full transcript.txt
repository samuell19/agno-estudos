YOU DIDN'T SEE BY ANY CHANCE MY CAT ANGELO? YOU KNOW, THE PINK ONE? NO. HMM. HE'S A TRAMP. I FEED HIM, PLEASURE HE GIVES SOMEBODY ELSE. I SAW JANEY LAST NIGHT COMING HOME LATE, WITH THE FELLOW WITH THE EYEGLASSES. ANGELO! Woman: IS THAT YOU, TOM? WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE? Radio announcer: WE WILL RETURN TO THE ROMANCE OF HELEN TRENT IN JUST A MOMENT. I DIDN'T BEAT THE DAWN. I DIDN'T SLEEP SO GOOD MYSELF. IF I'D BEAT THE DAWN, I COULD GET SOME SLEEP. AND NOW LOOK AT THAT LIGHT COMING IN. WELL, WEAR ONE OF THEM THINGS LIKE WHAT'S-HIS-NAME WHO WORKS NIGHTS. OVER YOUR EYES, YOU KNOW. CLEAR OUT TO IDLEWILD THIS FARE WANTED ME TO GO. SO I SAYS, "LOOK, I WORK UPTOWN." SO HE SAYS, "SO WHAT? YOU'RE A CAB DRIVER, AIN'T YA?" SO? SO I SAID, "MAYBE I AM, BUT YOU CAN GET YOURSELF MANY A HACK THAT'S GOING YOUR WAY." SO HE SAID HE WAS GONNA CALL A COP, AND I TOLD HIM TO GO AHEAD. SO? SO I DROVE TO IDLEWILD, AND THAT BROKE THE BACK OF THE NIGHT. ANYWAY, IT'S MY LAST DAY OF WORKING NIGHTS. LOOK AT THAT ICE... CAKED SOLID. NO. NO NEW CONTRIVANCES IN THIS HOUSE TILL AFTER I HAVE MY OWN HACK. I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING ABOUT A NEW ICEBOX. HELLO, POP. WHO'S IN THE BATHROOM? YOUR UNCLE JACK. OH. EDDIE UP YET? YEAH, HE'S UP. I HEARD YOU COMING HOME LATE LAST NIGHT. YOU WERE WHERE? WITH RALPH. WE WENT TO SEE FATHER MURPHY. FATHER MURPHY, NOW. MA? YEAH? MA? RALPH AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED. WELL, JANE, THAT'S VERY NICE. WELL, WHAT FINALLY DECIDED US WAS RALPH'S GOT THIS FRIEND, YOU KNOW, IN CALIFORNIA, BUT HIS WIFE'S PREGNANT, SO HE ASKED RALPH IF HE KNEW SOMEBODY WHO COULD DRIVE HIS CAR OUT FOR HIM, BECAUSE HE CAN'T DRIVE IT OUT HIMSELF, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HIS WIFE'S PREGNANT, SO... SO RALPH THOUGHT QUICKLY AND DECIDED WE COULD MAKE A NICE HONEYMOON OUT OF A NICE TRIP TO CALIFORNIA LIKE THAT. TOM, YOUR DAUGHTER'S GETTING MARRIED. I'M NOT DEAF, AGGIE. JANE, THAT'S VERY NICE. WELL, ANYWAY, RALPH FINISHES HIS SCHOOL TERM ON NOVEMBER 3. THAT'S TOMORROW. THAT'S JUST 3 WEEKS BEFORE HE STARTS THE WINTER SESSION. HE'S TEACHING THE REGULAR WINTER SESSION THIS YEAR, SO WE DECIDED BOTH OF US THAT NOVEMBER 6 WAS JUST PERFECT. SO DID FATHER MURPHY, AND HE'S ANNOUNCING THE BANNS THIS SUNDAY AT MASS AND GOT US A DISPENSATION. WE'LL HAVE TO INVITE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER FOR DINNER. FATHER MURPHY'S? NO, RALPH'S. MR. AND MRS. HALLORAN. GIVE ME THE SALT AND PEPPER. I KNOW IT'S KIND OF SHORT NOTICE, MA, BUT HOW ABOUT TONIGHT? COULD WE HAVE THEM OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT? WELL, IT'S FRIDAY. I'M GOING TO THE FISH MARKET, ANYWAY. TONIGHT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU, PA? HUH? OH, IT'S FINE. FINE WITH ME, JANE. I'M THROUGH IN THE BATHROOM. ALL RIGHT, JACK. LISTEN, I'LL CALL RALPH AND HAVE HIM BRING THEM OVER AROUND 7:00. AND MA, DON'T GO TO ANY EXTRA TROUBLE, YOU KNOW? JUST FISH AND POTATOES LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE ON FRIDAY NIGHT. IN FACT, ONE THING I'D LIKE TO GET STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE NO BIG WEDDING. JUST A PLAIN, SIMPLE CEREMONY. THAT'S THE BEST WAY, JANE. NO WEDDING RECEPTION, NO NOTHING. BECAUSE I WANT TO GET AN EARLY START FOR CALIFORNIA. THE WHOLE THING WILL ONLY TAKE ABOUT 10 MINUTES. THAT'S THE BEST WAY OF ALL, JANE. NO WEDDING RECEPTION, NO NOTHING. NONE OF THE FUSS AND FEATHERS THAT GOES ON WITH ALL THESE BIG WEDDINGS. YOUR COUSIN JOHN TOLD ME IT COST HIM $3,000 TO GIVE HIS DAUGHTER CAROLINE HER WEDDING. WELL, JANE, IF IT'S A SMALL WEDDING YOU WANT, THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL HAVE. $3,000 FOR A WEDDING BREAKFAST. IT'S ENOUGH TO CHILL YOUR BLOOD. IF WE WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS HONEYMOON IN THE CAR, WE HAVE TO GET MARRIED BY NOVEMBER 6, NEXT TUESDAY. WELL, JANE, THAT'S VERY SENSIBLE OF YOU. ANYWAY, YOUR PA AND ME THOUGHT WE'D GIVE YOU A CHECK FOR 500. 500? OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, TOM, YOUR ONE LIVING DAUGHTER'S GETTING MARRIED. COST YOU MORE THAN 500 IF SHE WANTED A RECEPTION PARTY. WELL, I DIDN'T SAY NO. WE ALWAYS SAID WE'D GIVE THE KID A CHECK, BUT WE NEVER SPECIFIED NO FIGURE. PLEASE, WE DON'T WANT NO CHECKS. WE JUST WANT TO GET MARRIED. SO NOVEMBER 6 AT ST. AUGUSTINE'S, JUST YOU TWO AND EDDIE AND RALPH'S MOTHER AND FATHER, AND I'LL ASK ALICE, BECAUSE I WAS HER MAID OF HONOR, AND THE WHOLE THING WILL TAKE ABOUT 10 MINUTES. YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK YOUR UNCLE JACK. MA, IF WE ASK UNCLE JACK, THEN... WE'D HAVE TO INVITE UNCLE HARRY AND AUNT TERESA... BUT HE LIVES RIGHT HERE IN THE HOUSE WITH US. MA, JUST THE IMMEDIATE FAMILIES. I'D LIKE TO ASK UNCLE JACK, BUT IF WE DO, THE OTHERS WILL ALL BE MAD. YEAH, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT. IF YOU ASK ONE, YOU'RE STUCK WITH A BUNDLE, AND THAT MEANS HAVING A BIG PARTY. BUT YOU BETTER LET ME TELL HIM. JACK'S A TOUCHY MAN. I'M GOING TO BED. JANE, UH... I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT, PA. YEAH. GOOD NIGHT. JANE... EDDIE OUGHT TO BE HERE FOR DINNER TONIGHT. I HOPE HE HASN'T GOT A DATE OR ANYTHING. JANE, IT'S A BIG THING, GETTING MARRIED. WHAT? I SAID IT'S A BIG THING, GETTING MARRIED TO SOMEBODY. WELL, SURE IT IS. YOU GOT TO PREPARE FOR IT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, PREPARE? WELL, I WAS JUST SAYING MARRIAGE ISN'T ALL ROSES, YOU KNOW. WELL, WHO ON EARTH EVER SAID IT WAS? YOU GOT TO LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP. MA, I'VE KNOWN RALPH 3 YEARS... BUT I WASN'T SAYING YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM ALL RIGHT. I WAS JUST SAYING THAT MARRIAGE IS A BIG THING, LIKE SOME GIRLS DON'T KNOW NOWADAYS. AND YOU GOT TO MAKE SACRIFICES. AND WHEN THE CHILDREN START COMING, YOU GOT TO PUT THEM FIRST AHEAD OF EVERYBODY. I KNOW, MA... AND YOU CAN'T GO THROWING MONEY AROUND. I HOPE YOU GOT MORE THAN YOUR PA AND ME, BUT IF YOU DON'T, DON'T GO THROWING IT AROUND. NO, MA. AND THEN ONE DAY YOU'LL FIND OUT A LOT OF TIME'S GONE BY, AND YOU'LL WAKE UP KNOWING THIS IS THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE... JUST LIKE THIS. DAY AFTER DAY, YEAR AFTER YEAR, JUST THE SAME. AND THAT'S WHY BEING MARRIED'S SUCH A BIG THING. THE SAME THING, OVER AND OVER? WELL, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? WHAT DO YOU EXPECT, A BED OF ROSES? MA, I'M ONLY SAYING WHAT YOU SAID. AND DON'T GET MARRIED THINKING IT'S ONLY A GOOD TIME. IT'S NOT A BAD TIME, BUT IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME, LIVING ALL YOUR LIFE WITH ONE MAN AND STRUGGLING TO RAISE THE CHILDREN DECENT. AND DON'T GO RUNNING AROUND, STAYING OUT LATE NIGHT IN BARS, LIKE SO MANY DO NOWADAYS. RALPH AND ME LIKE STAYING HOME. OH, AND MIND YOUR TEMPER. DON'T LET NOTHING GET YOU DOWN, NO MATTER WHAT. YOU GOT TO GIVE AND TAKE. MA, THOSE ARE ALL THE THINGS YOU DON'T DO, BUT WHAT DO YOU DO? I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED? WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU'RE MARRIED, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. ISN'T THERE ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES NOT DOING THIS AND THAT? LIKE WHAT? WELL, LIKE LOVING SOMEBODY. WELL, OF COURSE THERE IS, BUT DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE ANY BED OF ROSES. I KNOW, MA. AND I KNOW YOU'VE KNOWN RALPH QUITE A TIME, AND BEING MARRIED, WELL... WELL, BEING MARRIED'S DIFFERENT FROM WHEN I WAS A GIRL. US NOT KNOWING ABOUT THINGS IN ADVANCE. YOU KNOW. THINGS IN ADVANCE? YEAH. OH, MA, THAT! WELL, IT'S IMPORTANT. WELL, SURE IT IS. THEY CALL IT COMPATIBILITY. WELL, I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY CALL IT, BUT JUST YOU REMEMBER IT'S NOT THE WHOLE THING, LIKE SO MANY KIDS NOWADAYS SEEM TO THINK... WHICH IS WHY THERE'S THIS TROUBLE ALL THE TIME, MARRYING AND DIVORCING. WELL, MA, HONESTLY, RALPH AND ME ARE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY TROUBLE THAT WAY. OH. I MEAN, WE'RE BOTH GROWN-UP, AND WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME. I THINK IT'S NICE YOU'RE SO SENSIBLE. EXCEPT THAT AFTER A WHILE, IT'S JUST NOT THAT IMPORTANT OR ANYTHING. OH, EDDIE, YOUR SISTER'S MARRYING RALPH. WELL, THAT'S GOOD. THAT ALL YOU GOT TO SAY? CONGRATULATIONS. EDDIE, YOUR SISTER'S MARRYING RALPH. I HEARD YOU. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID. SHE'S GOT HIM, SO GOOD. I NEVER SEEN LESS FAMILY SPIRIT. SO WHO'S GOT SPIRIT? I GOT NOTHING. NEXT MONTH FORT DIX, THEN THE ARMY'S GOT NOTHING. WELL, AS LONG AS YOU LIVE HERE IN... EDDIE, RALPH'S FAMILY IS COMING OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT, AND YOU GOT TO BE HERE TO MEET HIS FAMILY. I TOLD THE GUYS I'D SEE THEM EARLY. YOU'LL BE HERE. SEE? I'VE GOT NO RIGHTS. WELL, I GOT TO GO. OH, MA, WILL YOU TALK TO UNCLE JACK? YOU'LL EXPLAIN IT TO HIM? YEAH, I'LL TALK TO HIM. JANE? YES, MA? WELL... IT'S A BIG THING YOU'RE DOING. WELL, I'M LATE. SO JANE'S GETTING MARRIED AT LAST. I CAN'T SAY IT WAS A SURPRISE OR ANYTHING. THE FIRST ONE. THE FIRST ONE TO BE MARRIED. BE NICE FOR JANE, BEING SETTLED WITH RALPH AND RAISING HER OWN FAMILY. I WISH WE COULD GIVE HER A REAL WEDDING, BUT SHE'S GOT A GOOD HEAD ON HER SHOULDERS. I WAS TALKING TO HER JUST NOW, YOU KNOW, ABOUT... ABOUT BEING MARRIED. SHE'S GOT SOME FUNNY IDEAS. MOST GIRLS DO. BUT I TALKED SENSE TO HER. I TOLD HER WHAT IT WAS LIKE. WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEING MARRIED. WELL, JACK, WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR SOME NEWS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO YOURSELF? I'M COUNTING THE BEATS OF ME HEART. OH, THAT? YOU'RE AS HEALTHY AS ANYBODY. IT'S A FASTER AND STEADY BEAT. AND THE BLOOD PRESSURE'S GONE UP. I CAN FEEL IT POUNDING. ME COUSIN TIMOTHY PASSED OVER FROM THE VERY SAME THING. TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME HE WAS, AND A MAN OF IRON, THEY SAY. DO YOU KNOW, I... I THINK I'LL DROP IN AND SEE THE DOCTOR. JANE'S GETTING MARRIED AT LAST, TO RALPH HALLORAN. AH! THAT'S GREAT NEWS. HA HA HA! THAT'S GREAT NEWS! WHERE IS SHE NOW, IN THE KITCHEN? SHE JUST NOW WENT TO WORK. WELL, THIS IS A DAY I THOUGHT I'D NEVER LIVE TO SEE. IS THAT THE FELLOW WITH THE GLASSES? THE SAME. SHE'S HAVING THE BANNS ANNOUNCED AT SUNDAY MASS, WITH THE WEDDING ON THE SIXTH, NEXT TUESDAY. WE'LL GIVE THEM A PARTY LIKE NONE OTHER. WE PUT A BOTTLE OF BEER IN THE KITCHEN AND WE PILE THE ROOMS HIGH WITH COUSINS, UNCLES, AND AUNTS. JACK, TIE YOUR SHOE BEFORE YOU TRIP AND FALL. SAY, AGGIE, WHY DON'T YOU RENT A HALL, THE WAY JOHN DID WITH HIS CAROLINE? JACK... I'LL PAY FOR THE RENT OF THE HALL. JACK, IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT WAY. SHE'S JUST HAVING A SMALL WEDDING EARLY IN THE MORNING, THAT'S ALL. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS. AND, UH, THERE ARE OTHER COMPLICATIONS. Eddie: SO LONG, MOM. DON'T YOU BE LATE, EDDIE. YOU SEE, THERE'S THIS, UH, THIS FELLA WHO'S GOT A CAR, AND THEY'RE MOVING TO CALIFORNIA, BUT HIS WIFE IS PREGNANT... WHAT'S THAT? WHO'S PREGNANT? THE OTHER FELLA'S WIFE. BUT THE THING IS THIS, JACK... NOW... NOW DON'T BE TOUCHY. YOU KNOW HOW DEAR YOU ARE TO ALL OF US, BUT IF WE INVITE YOU, WE GOT TO INVITE MICHAEL AND TOM AND JOE, AND ALL THE COUSINS, AND BEFORE WE KNOW IT, THERE WILL BE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS. SO WE DECIDED JUST THE SIMPLEST CEREMONY WITH ONLY IMMEDIATE FAMILY. AND WOULD I NOT BE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY? JACK, YOU SEE, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THEY'RE MARRIED ON THE SIXTH, BECAUSE... I SEE, THEN I'M NOT TO BE INVITED TO THE WEDDING, HUH? JACK, YOU CAN SEE THAT IF WE INVITE YOU, WE GOT TO INVITE TOM, MICHAEL, AND JOE, AND ALL OF FRANK'S BUNCH. ME COAT. I LEFT IT AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. JACK, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU, BUT YOU CAN SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. AND TIE YOUR SHOE. SO, THE BOY'S MOTHER AND FATHER ARE COMING FOR DINNER, AND WE WOULDN'T THINK NOT TO HAVE YOU. 7:00 IT IS, SO DON'T BE COMING HOME LATE. OH, JACK, YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE DOWN TO THE UNION HALL TILL 11:00. I THINK I'LL CALL IN AND SEE THE DOCTOR. I DON'T FEEL ANY TOO HEARTY. WELL, BE HOME EARLY. THEY'RE COMING AT 7:00. NOW DON'T FORGET. AND JACK, TIE YOUR SHOE BEFORE YOU TRIP AND FALL. THE EGGS YOU LOAN ME, EH? THEY WERE A LIFE-SAVER, MRS. HURLEY. THANKS FOR BRINGING THEM BACK. HAVE YOU GOT A LITTLE CUP OF COFFEE FOR ME? YEAH. YEAH. OH. YOU KNOW, THIS VARICOSE VEIN OF MINE, MMM, THEY'RE MURDER. I'M TELLING YOU, PLAIN MURDER. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I'M GETTING TOO OLD. I KNOW THAT, BUT I CAN'T WALK, I CAN'T STAND UP. AND HOW'S YOUR DAUGHTER JANEY? SHE ALWAYS GOES OUT WITH THAT FELLA WITH THE GLASSES. SHE'S GETTING MARRIED ON NOVEMBER 6. MARRIED? AH! CONGRATULATIONS, MRS. HURLEY. HEY, THAT MUST BE A LOAD OUT OF YOUR BACK. I KNOW. I MARRY 6 GIRLS, AND IT WAS A STONE OUT OF MY BACK ALL THE TIME. RALPH'S A NICE BOY. LOOK... FROZE SOLID. HE'S WELL FIXED, HUH? HE'S A TEACHER. WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, TOO. HIS FATHER'S IN REAL ESTATE, DOING VERY GOOD. THEY LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE BIG APARTMENT BUILDINGS WITH 3 ELEVATORS, YOU KNOW THE KIND? WHEN YOU WANT TO SEE A PERSON, YOU PHONE FROM DOWNSTAIRS? YEAH, I KNOW. BECAUSE MY GIRL'S SISTER, SHE LIVES IN ONE OF THEM THINGS, BIG APARTMENT. AND YOU KNOW WHICH ONE? YOU KNOW, SHE'S THE ONE THAT HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE. BUT SHE MARRIED GOOD. UNTIL NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHY. WELL, THE WEDDING IS GONNA BE NEXT WEEK, HUH? SO SOON, AIN'T IT? YEAH. JUST A SMALL, QUIET AFFAIR. NO FUSS, NO RECEPTION. WON'T TAKE 10 MINUTES. RALPH'S GOT THE LOAN OF THIS CAR, AND THEY'RE GOING BUCKING IT OFF TO CALIFORNIA. OH, SO IT'S GONNA BE A QUAINT AFFAIR, NOBODY AROUND, HUH? YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS. YOU SEE, THIS FELLA'S WIFE IS... IS PREGNANT, SO RALPH'S GOT THE USE OF HIS CAR. PREGNANT? AND HOW ARE YOU, MRS. HURLEY, TODAY? PRETTY GOOD. I GOT COMPANY FOR DINNER.

WELL, THAT'S WHAT JANE WANTS. SHE JUST DON'T WANT NO... NO FANCY WEDDING. YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAYS. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID. JOE? DID YOU EVER KNOW A GIRL THAT DIDN'T WANT A FANCY WEDDING AND WEAR A WHITE DRESS THAT TRAILS 10 FEET BEHIND HER? IT'S A BIG THING IN A GIRL'S LIFE. WELL, JANE'S NOT THAT TYPE. SHE'S JUST A DOWN-TO-EARTH GIRL, NO NONSENSE. 10 MINUTES IN THE MORNING WITH FATHER MURPHY, AND THAT'S THE STORY. 10 MINUTES IN THE MORNING? THAT DON'T EVEN SOUND RELIGIOUS TO ME. WELL, I GUESS FATHER MURPHY KNOWS WHAT'S RELIGIOUS AND WHAT AIN'T. IS SHE IN TROUBLE? IS WHO IN TROUBLE? WELL, YOUR DAUGHTER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IS SHE IN TROUBLE? WELL, I MEAN IF SHE'S GETTING MARRIED IN SUCH A RUSH, WHAT'S ALL THE HURRY FOR? FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, MRS. CASEY. LOOK, THEY GOT THE LOAN OF THIS CAR... PERSONALLY, I THINK IT'S SWELL JANE DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU TO A WHOLE LOT OF EXPENSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD, WHEN LOTS OF GIRLS IN HER PLACE... LOOK, WE'RE NOT EXACTLY ON RELIEF, AND WE CAN AFFORD TO GIVE OUR GIRL A BIG WEDDING IF THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS. BUT YOU SEE, THEY GOT THE LOAN OF THIS CAR... IS SHE IN TROUBLE? LOOK... THE OTHER FELLA'S WIFE IS HAVING THE BABY. I UNDERSTAND. MM-HMM... HELLO. IS RALPH HALLORAN THERE? THANKS, JACK. HELLO? RALPH? HI. ABOUT TONIGHT, CAN YOUR FAMILY MAKE IT? WHAT? WELL, NO. I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU. I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE KIND OF ROUGH FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS, BUT... IT'S SOMETHING EVERYBODY GETTING MARRIED HAS TO DO, GETTING THEIR FAMILIES TOGETHER. HONEY... HONEY, IT'S NOT IMPORTANT IF YOUR PEOPLE OR MY PEOPLE LIKE EACH OTHER. THEY'LL JUST SIZE EACH OTHER UP, AND MY FAMILY WILL FIGURE YOU'RE LUCKY, AND YOUR FAMILY WILL FIGURE I'M LUCKY. SO DON'T WORRY, HUH? I'LL PICK THEM UP AND BE OVER ABOUT 7:00. GOOD-BYE, HONEY. HI. WHY, RALPH! WELL, HELLO! HOW'S MY BOY? SIT DOWN, TAKE A LOAD OFF YOUR FEET. HI, MOM. HOW ARE YOU, KID? LONG TIME NO SEE. SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN. WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT THIS MAN THAT BRINGS THE TEENAGERS UP ON THE STAGE TO DO THINGS THE WAY MAJOR BOWLES USED TO. MY, THEY'RE TALENTED. I HEAR WE'RE GOING TO A BIG BLOWOUT TONIGHT. GONNA MEET THE NEW IN-LAWS? IT'S JUST SUPPER, THAT'S ALL. OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET JANE'S FAMILY. BUT I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WEREN'T... AHEM. UH... HAVE YOU GOT A COLD? NO SWEATER ON YOU. SAY, HOW ABOUT A SNORT, RALPHIE? I GOT A BOTTLE OF RYE. I GOT A BRAND-NEW BOTTLE. I'M JUST WAITING FOR AN EXCUSE TO OPEN IT. NO THANKS, DAD. OH, RALPH, I WISH YOU WEREN'T GOING OFF LIKE THIS WITHOUT A PROPER PARTY OR ANYTHING. IT SEEMS SO KIND OF COLD-BLOODED. YEAH, YOUR MOM'S RIGHT, RALPHIE. IT DOES SEEM LIKE A SHAME NOT HAVING A REAL PARTY. OF COURSE, IF HURLEY HASN'T GOT THE MONEY TO SPEND... DAD, DAD, DAD... MOM, MOM... WE DON'T WANT A PARTY. WELL, IF MY DAUGHTER WAS GETTING MARRIED, I'D SPEND MY LAST PENNY TO SEE THAT SHE HAD A REAL WEDDING. SAY, WHAT ABOUT ME PUTTING UP THE MONEY, HMM? LISTEN, I COULD GET THE BALLROOM AT THE ST. MORITZ... YOU COULDN'T DO THAT, JOE, NO. ONLY THE BRIDE'S FATHER CAN DO THAT. I'M SURE THAT THE HURLEYS WOULDN'T OBJECT... DAD, DAD, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE. PLEASE WAIT A MINUTE. ALL WE WANT TO DO IS GET MARRIED, YOU KNOW, QUIETLY, AND TAKE A TRIP, AND THAT'S ALL. YEAH, BUT I BET DEEP DOWN IN HER HEART, JANE WOULD LIKE A REAL WEDDING. NEVER MIND. WHAT RALPHIE WANTS IS FINE. LET'S LET IT GO AT THAT, HUH? I MUST CHANGE MY CLOTHES. HAVE TO LOOK MY BEST. HA HA! AND ABOUT 4:00 IN THE MORNING, I HEARD THESE OWLS AGAIN. SO I TURNED TO MARY AND I SAID, "HONEY," I SAID, "DO YOU HEAR THOSE OWLS?" SHE SAID, "NO." I SAID, "THIS IS THE LAST HONEYMOON I'M EVER GONNA SPEND IN THIS WILDERNESS." SHE SAID, "THIS IS THE LAST HONEYMOON YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND, PERIOD!" THE JOKE OF IT IS, WE NEVER DID GET TO NIAGARA FALLS! YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME OF A STORY WHEN A FELLA... COULD I FIX YOU ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE DRINKS? Mr. Halloran: YES, YES. YOU MIGHT SWEETEN IT UP A BIT. JUST ON THE ROCKS, PLEASE, MRS. HURLEY. REMINDS ME OF A STORY... CAN I FIX YOU ANOTHER ONE OF THESE DRINKS? OH, GOODNESS, NO, THANKS. I'M STILL LIGHTHEADED FROM THE LAST ONE. IT WAS SO STRONG. REMINDS ME OF THE TIME OUR IRENE WAS MARRIED. MA, DID YOU TELL UNCLE JACK 7:00? YEAH, I DID. GOODNESS, WE DRANK THAT DAY. Mr. Halloran: HURLEY... OH, THANK YOU KINDLY, MA'AM. HURLEY, RALPHIE HERE TELLS ME THAT YOU'RE IN THE TAXICAB BUSINESS. WELL, IT'S BY WAY OF BEING MY LIVELIHOOD, YES. IT'S INTERESTING WORK, I'D SAY, HUH? WELL, IT HAS THAT SIDE OF IT. I EXPECT YOU GET TO SEE QUITE A BIT OF THE PASSING PARADE, AS IT WERE, HUH? WELL, NOW AND THEN, I SORT OF GET A LOOK AT IT IN THE LITTLE MIRROR OVER THE WINDSHIELD. THAT'S GOOD. THE LITTLE MIRROR OVER THE WINDSHIELD. WELL, I GUESS UNCLE JACK ISN'T COMING HOME. I BETTER GO AND START IT. OH, I'LL HELP. NO, YOU STAY WITH OUR GUESTS. EDDIE? YEAH? PULL THE TABLE OUT. EXCUSE ME. YOU OWN YOUR OWN CAB, DO YOU? WELL, I HAVE PLANS OF BUYING ONE, YES. BUT FIRST YOU GOT TO GET THIS MEDALLION. MEDALLION? THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S A CITY LICENSE. YOU SEE, THE CITY WON'T LICENSE MORE HACKS, SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL A FELLA WHO'S GOT A MEDALLION WANTS TO SELL, AND THE GOING PRICE RIGHT NOW IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF $8,000. GET SOME ICE OUT RIGHT AWAY. WHAT FOR? FOR THE ICE WATER. YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING FOR THAT. WE'RE GONNA SERVE THIS DINNER PROPER, IF NOTHING ELSE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NOTHING ELSE? I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST GONNA BE DINNER, LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE ON FRIDAY NIGHT. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HER ONLY DAUGHTER GETTING MARRIED. MA, WE ALREADY DECIDED. SO INSTEAD, IT'S BEING DONE LIKE IT WAS SHAMEFUL AND SECRET. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SHAMEFUL AND SECRET? I HOPE WE GAVE THEM THE RIGHT WHISKEY. RALPH SAYS HIS FATHER DRINKS TOO MUCH. IT'S NO CONCERN OF OURS THIS NIGHT. MA, WHAT'S WRONG? STOP ACTING SO NERVOUS. COME ON. TAKE THE TRAY IN AND GET THEM STARTED. BE CAREFUL. I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST GONNA BE DINNER LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE. GO ON, BE QUICK. OH, IT FEELS AS THOUGH I'VE EATEN MYSELF HALF TO DEATH. Mr. Halloran: THAT WAS A SWELL FEED, MA'AM. A REAL SWELL FEED. Mrs. Hurley: YOU'RE WELCOME, I'M SURE. I DO HOPE IT WASN'T TOO MUCH TROUBLE. I MEAN, SO MANY AT ONE TIME. NO, WE ALWAYS EAT THIS WAY. Eddie: I'M GONNA MEET THE FELLAS, HUH, MA? OH, EDDIE. I WAS WONDERING, MR. HURLEY... YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO FOR YOU KIDS? I'VE GOT THIS APARTMENT IN MIND FOR YOU. IT'S A 3-ROOM APARTMENT, THE BEDFORD PARK SECTION. IT'S NOT BIG, BUT IT'S GOT A NICE KITCHEN. LIVING ROOM 18' BY 11', AND THE RENT $81 A MONTH. AND THE FIRST YEAR'S RENT, THAT'S MY WEDDING PRESENT TO YOU. THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU, MR. HALLORAN. IT SURE IS, DAD, BUT WE WERE PLANNING... I FIGURE THAT IT WAS THE LEAST WE CAN DO FOR THE YOUNG ONES AS THEY LEAVE THE NEST. YES, SIR, THEY LEAVE THE NEST. THE OLDEST BOY JOE, HE'S BEEN MARRIED 10 YEARS NOW. HE'S GOT TWO FINE CHILDREN. DOING VERY WELL IN THESE PLASTICS. THE TWO GIRLS... IRENE, SHE'S BEEN MARRIED NOW TO A SKIN DOCTOR DOWN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THEY LIVE IN A VERY STYLISH HOUSE, YOU KNOW. YES, OUT IN THE NORTHWEST SECTION. IT'S A RANCH-TYPE PLACE... THAT'S AWFUL NICE, BUT... YOU KNOW, WHEN IRENE GOT MARRIED, WE TOOK THE GRAND BALLROOM OF THE BEDFORD PLAZA HOTEL? Mrs. Halloran: I LIKE THE BEDFORD PLAZA. WOULD YOU LIKE A CIGAR, TOM? OH, THANKS. WE HAD OVER 400 GUESTS THERE. YEAH, THE TABLE OF HORS D'OEUVRES ALONE COST ME ALMOST $1,400... 1,400! OF COURSE, WHEN THE OTHER GIRL GOT MARRIED, THAT WAS A REALBLOWOUT! WE TOOK THE GRAND BALLROOM DOWNTOWN AT THE ST. MORITZ HOTEL THAT TIME. I LIKE THE ST. MORITZ, TOO. WELL, WE THOUGHT WE'D GIVE THE KIDS A CHECK FOR A WEDDING PRESENT, YOU KNOW? TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO WITH. TO THE AMOUNT OF $1,000. YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING, TOM? Mr. Halloran: OF COURSE I KNOW THAT THE KIDS HERE SAY THAT THEY DON'T WANT A CATERED AFFAIR... I WAS UNAVOIDABLY DETAINED. DINNER'S OVER. A FEW OLD FRIENDS AND I MET BY CHANCE IN THE GREEN GRASS GRILL, AND I WAS... DETAINED. THIS IS MY BROTHER JACK CONLON. MR. AND MRS. HALLORAN. AND RALPH YOU KNOW. NICE TO KNOW YOU. PLEASE TO MEET YOU, MRS. HANNIGAN, AND TO WELCOME YOU TO THIS HOUSE. JACK, MR. HALLORAN WAS JUST TELLING US ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. HEH. ONLY IMMEDIATE FAMILY. HUH? WHAT'S THAT?

NO RELATION BY ANY CHANCE TO MY FRIEND MICHAEL? DIED OF DRINK LAST MONTH AT THE BELLEVUE HOSPITAL. NO. WELL, IT'S A COMMON NAME, BUT 'TIS AN UNCOMMON MAN, MICHAEL HALLORAN. YOU WERE TELLING US ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. THE WHOLE AFFAIR, LET ME SAY, WAS FULLY DISCUSSED IN THE GREEN GRASS GRILL... THAT I WASN'T TO ATTEND THE WEDDING OF ME NIECE. OH, AND IT WAS A FINE DINNER, MRS. HURLEY. I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'VE SEEN JOE EAT SO MUCH. 12 YEARS I'VE LIVED IN THIS ROOM... 12 LONG YEARS IN THIS VERY ROOM. THIS VERY ROOM?

MR. CONLON WANTS TO GO TO SLEEP. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I COULD DO WITH A LITTLE REST. ME HEART'S OVERTAXED TODAY, AND I NEED ME BEAUTY SLEEP. JACK'S JUST CARRYING ON, THAT'S ALL. CARRYING ON, IS IT? I SHOULD THINK ME LAST NIGHT IN THIS HOUSE MIGHT BE... YOUR LAST NIGHT? YES, AGGIE. I'M MOVING OUT TOMORROW TO FIND SOME RESIDENCE ELSEWHERE. NOW, ONE AND ALL, GOOD NIGHT. Mrs. Hurley: I'M VERY SORRY. Mrs. Halloran: VERY NICE TIME. Mr. Halloran: GOOD NIGHT. IT WAS VERY NICE. GOOD NIGHT. Mrs. Hurley: GOOD NIGHT, RALPH. Ralph: GOOD NIGHT, MRS. HURLEY. BYE. JANE, I BEEN THINKING... WELL, YOU HEARD THEM TONIGHT. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. GIVING AWAY APARTMENTS RIGHT AND LEFT THEY WERE, BUFFALO THIS AND NIAGARA THAT. MA, DON'T WORRY. WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY APARTMENT. AND YOUR UNCLE JACK COMING HOME LIKE A CRAZY MAN. JANE, YOU GOT TO HAVE A REAL WEDDING. MA, WE CAN'T, THAT'S ALL. THERE ISN'T TIME. OH, JUST THINK, YOU CAN DOLL UP IN A BEAUTIFUL DRESS WITH ALICE AS YOUR MATRON OF HONOR. WELL, WHO GETS MARRIED ON 5 DAYS' NOTICE? RALPH AND ME. DOWN AT THE MARKET, MRS.

OH, COME ON NOW, AGGIE, TAKE IT EASY. LET'S NOT GET IN AN UPROAR ABOUT THIS. WE OWE IT TO THE FAMILY. PEOPLE WILL SAY WE'RE ON RELIEF OR SOMETHING. WELL, WE'RE NOT, AND WE KNOW WE'RE NOT. AND THE WEDDING PRESENT... I'VE GIVEN AWAY SO MANY WEDDING PRESENTS THAT PILED HIGH, THEY'D BE AS BIG AS THE EMPIRE STATE. I'D LIKE TO GET SOME OF THEM BACK. AM I RIGHT, TOM? YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, AGGIE. MA, WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY BIG WEDDINGS, AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT! HEY, I'M THROUGH. PUT YOUR SHOES ON. WELL? YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED AT CAROLINE'S WEDDING? AUNT EMMA STILL WON'T TALK TO AUNT LU BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T LET HER SIT AT THE BRIDE'S TABLE. AND KATHLEEN REARDON WAS THE MAID OF HONOR. WENT AND BOUGHT AN ORGANDY DRESS FOR $42! AND CAROLINE WOULDN'T LET HER WEAR IT, BECAUSE ONLY THE BRIDE CAN WEAR WHITE. AND THEY HAD THAT BIG FIGHT. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUT I DON'T WANT ALL THE FUSS AND THE FIGHTING AND SCREAMING THAT ALWAYS GOES ON. AM I RIGHT, PA? YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. WELL, HOW CAN SHE BE RIGHT AND SHEBE RIGHT? HOW CAN THEY BOTH BE RIGHT? AND YOU'RE RIGHT, TOO. WELL, ALL I KNOW IS, I'VE DEEPLY OFFENDED MY BROTHER JACK. BOY, HE SURE HUNG ONE ON TONIGHT. SHUT UP. I'M ACCUSED OF ATHEISM, OF NOT LOVING MY CHILDREN, AND OF BEING A WARD OF THE STATE. MA, IT'S MY WEDDING. LET ME RUN IT MY OWN WAY! AND THAT HALLORAN... GIVING THEM AN APARTMENT. WHAT ARE WE GIVING THEM FOR A WEDDING PRESENT? NOTHING BUT A CHECK FOR SOME MONEY. WHAT HAVE WE EVER GIVEN THAT GIRL, HER COMING UNEXPECTED AND US FAVORING TERRENCE... GOD REST HIS SOUL. AND I FEEL VERY GUILTY. I FEEL WE OWE HER A BIG SPLASH FOR A WEDDING. SO MAYBE IT COSTS US $2,000... 2,000?! OH. SO YOU'RE AWAKE NOW, ARE YOU? YOU'RE NOT SLEEPY WHEN THERE ARE NO GUESTS TO BE RUN OUT OF THE HOUSE. MA, RALPH ONLY HAS 3 WEEKS OFF, AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT HE SEES NEW MEXICO. AND IF WE WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT CAR, WE... THAT CAR! I'VE BEEN EXPLAINING ABOUT THE FELLA WITH THE CAR AND THE WIFE WHO'S PREGNANT IN CALIFORNIA, AND EVERY TIME I TELL IT, IT SOUNDS SILLIER! HOW YOU FEELING, UNCLE JACK? DON'T TALK TO ME. OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE! I'VE LIVED IN THIS HOUSE FOR 12 YEARS, AND IF THAT ISN'T IMMEDIATE FAMILY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. OH, JACK... WELL, THERE YOU ARE. YOUR UNCLE JACK, WHO LENT US THE MONEY WHEN WE WAS BROKE, WHO PAYS HIS SHARE OF THE RENT HERE, MOVING OUT BECAUSE HE'S HURT. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING... YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BIG WEDDING WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME! I'M RIGHT, TOM. I KNOW I'M RIGHT ABOUT THIS! IT'S ALL FOR HER, SOMETHING FOR HER, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. WELL? I'M GOING TO BED. WELL, AM I RIGHT? AGGIE, $2,000 IS HALF OF EVERYTHING I EVER SAVED. LOOK, TOM... THINK OF THAT GIRL LEAVING THIS HOUSE WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR HER WHOLE LIFE WITH US. JUST MOVING OUT, LIKE... LIKE SHE WAS CHANGING A PLACE TO LIVE. WE'VE BEEN LIKE NOTHING AT ALL TO HER... JUST STRANGERS LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE. JANE, I'M SORRY ABOUT JUST NOW. ABOUT LOSING MY TEMPER, I MEAN. BUT I MEANT IT, EVERY WORD I SAID. ABOUT BEING SO WORRIED WHAT THE NEIGHBORS SAID? AFRAID THEY THOUGHT I WAS IN TROUBLE? OH, NO, THAT DON'T MATTER. I MEAN WHEN I SAID... WELL, WE NEVER DONE ANYTHING FOR YOU. BUT MA, WE AREN'T ASKING FOR ANYTHING. OH, I KNOW IT'S NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS JUST TO GIVE YOU A FINE PARTY, BUT YOUR PA AND ME... WELL, YOUR MA WANTS THIS WEDDING VERY MUCH. MA, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. JANE, I NEVER HAD A PROPER WEDDING. I WAS MARRIED ALL IN A RUSH ONE SATURDAY MORNING, AND ME IN THIS OLD COTTON DRESS NOT FIT TO BE SEEN ON THE STREET WITH, LET ALONE BE MARRIED IN. OH, I SAID I DIDN'T MIND, BUT I DID. TO THIS DAY. LOOK, I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS ONE FINE THING, WITH ALL THE TRIMMINGS. SOMETHING TO REMEMBER WHEN... WELL, WHEN THE BAD DAYS COME, AND... YOU'RE ALL WORE OUT AND GROWING OLD... LIKE ME. MA... ALL RIGHT, MA. I'LL TELL RALPH, BUT HE ISN'T GONNA LIKE IT. OH, SURE HE WILL. WELL, AT LEAST THAT WILL KEEP UNCLE JACK FROM MOVING OUT. YEAH, POOR MAN. I FELT SO HIGH WHEN I HAD TO TELL HIM HE WAS NOT TO SEE YOU MARRIED. IT'LL TAKE A LOT OF FIGURING OUT. YEAH. SENDING OUT INVITATIONS AND... WE WON'T BE ABLE TO HAVE THE TRIP. SO YOU'LL GO SOMEPLACE NEARBY. GOT TO GO TO BED. GOT A LOT TO DO TOMORROW. SEE YOU IN THE MORNING, JANE. GOOD NIGHT, JANE. GOOD NIGHT, MA. HELLO? Jane: HELLO, RALPH? I'M SORRY ABOUT WAKING YOU UP. JANEY? WHAT'S THE MATTER? NO, NOTHING'S THE MATTER. I'M FINE. SURE, I'M SURE. RALPH... RALPH... I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING... BUT IT WILL KEEP TILL TOMORROW. WELL, I'M WIDE AWAKE NOW, HONEY. YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL ME NOW. IT'S NOTHING, RALPH. I GOT TO BE DOWNTOWN TOMORROW ANYWAY, AND I THOUGHT WE'D MEET AND HAVE COFFEE AND TALK A LITTLE. I'M SORRY ABOUT WAKING YOU UP. GOOD NIGHT, RALPH. HI. HI. YOU'RE LATE. YOU SHOULD HAVE STARTED WITHOUT ME. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT WAS ALL THE MYSTERY ABOUT? MYSTERY? WELL, YEAH. YOU PHONE ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, START TO TELL ME SOMETHING, STOP, START, STOP, TELL ME NOT TO WORRY, SO I SPEND HALF THE NIGHT WORRYING. RALPH? YEAH? NOTHING. JANEY, WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? I CAN'T TALK TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE IN A MOOD. I'MIN A MOOD? WELL, STOP BUILDING IT UP IN YOUR MIND. ALL RIGHT. RALPH? MM-HMM? RALPH, DO YOU LOVE ME? NO. I'M MARRYING YOU BECAUSE I DON'T LOVE YOU. I MEAN, NOTHING COULD SPOIL IT FOR US, COULD IT? LIKE WHAT? WELL, LIKE... LIKE HAVING A WEDDING PARTY. WEDDING PARTY? WELL, DON'T GET YOURSELF UP INTO A... I THOUGHT WE DECIDED ABOUT THE... I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT MA ASKED ME TONIGHT IF WE COULD HAVE A... MOM. WELL, YOU HEARD THEM. YOU KNOW THE WAY YOUR FOLKS CARRIED ON ABOUT THE BIG WEDDINGS THEY GAVE YOUR SISTERS, AND ALL THAT TALK ABOUT GIVING AWAY APARTMENTS. SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEIR GIVING US AN APARTMENT? THERE'S NOTHING WRONG. BUT MA JUST ABOUT BLEW HER TOP LISTENING TO ALL THE THINGS YOUR FOLKS DID FOR THEIR KIDS. WHILE SHE AND PA... HAVEN'T DONE A THING ABOUT... ABOUT US GETTING MARRIED. BECAUSE... THEY... THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY MONEY. RALPH, IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS THING, WE WON'T HAVE IT. WE'RE THE ONES THAT ARE GETTING MARRIED. RIGHT. IT WILL KILL MA IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS WEDDING PARTY. I GUESS IT MUST MEAN SOMETHING SPECIAL TO HER, AND I THOUGHT WE COULD... WELL, I TOLD HER I'D ASK YOU, AND MEET HER DOWNTOWN, AND... WE'D LOOK AT SOME BRIDAL GOWNS. ASK ME? YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME, HONEY. YOU'RE TELLING ME. RALPH? ARE YOU MAD AT ME? YOUR MOTHER WANTS A BIG, FANCY, EXTRAVAGANT WEDDING. YOUR COUSINS WANT IT, YOUR UNCLES WANT IT, NOW YOU WANT IT. IN FACT, THE WHOLE IRISH POPULATION OF THE BRONX WANTS A CATERED AFFAIR. FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, LEAVE THE POOR IRISH OUT OF IT. I'D LIKE TO LEAVE EVERYONE OUT OF IT. RALPH... RALPH... CAN WE TALK A MINUTE? I'VE GOT TO GO TO THE LIBRARY. I'M GONNA BE LATE. WAIT, PLEASE, WAIT. YOU WANT A BIG AFFAIR, WE'LL HAVE A BIG AFFAIR. IT'S JUST I NEVER KNEW IT WAS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU. NOT TO ME, TO HER. TO MOM. WHAT IT MEANS TO HER. LOOK, IF IT TAKES A CATERED AFFAIR TO BRING LOVE TO THE WORLD, YOU GOT MY APPROVAL. OK? OH, RALPH, YOU'RE VERY UNDERSTANDING. FRANKLY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL. LOOKS LIKE WE'VE ALL BEEN DESERTED. JANEY OUT SOMEWHERE AT THE CRACK OF DAWN, AGGIE OUT TENDING TO THE INVITATIONS, UH, YOU WOULDN'T BY ANY CHANCE BE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GREEN GRASS GRILL? YEAH, IT HAPPENS. COME ON. I'M HAVING TEA WITH MRS. RAFFERTY. AH, YES, IT WAS A GREATER DEED TO GIVE THE GIRL A FINE WEDDING. TO LAUNCH HER DOWN THE WAYS, YOU MIGHT SAY, LIKE A FINE SHIP WITH ALL FLAGS FLYING. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, IT WAS A WISE DECISION TO GIVE THE YOUNGSTERS A SWELL BANG-UP WEDDING. YEAH, $2,000. THAT'S BANG-UP, ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU, THAT I'M WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE ANY SUM, DON'T YOU? NO, NO. NO, JACK. NO, THIS IS AGGIE'S PARTY. WELL, AGGIE HAD THE RIGHT IDEA. HIRE A BIG BALLROOM, GIVE A GREAT PARTY. YEAH, THE WOMEN. AH, THE LADIES, GOD BLESS THEM. WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT THEM? I NEVER NOTICED YOU GETTING MARRIED TO ONE, JACK CONLON. OH, I RESERVE ME COMPANY FOR THE WORLD. YEAH, YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE BALLROOM OF THE CONCOURSE PLAZA, 5:00. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WELL, MRS. RAFFERTY, THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN THE SITUATION SINCE LAST WE MET AT THE GREEN GRASS GRILL. OH? I HAVE THE KETTLE BOILING FOR YOUR TEA, MR. CONLON. YES, JANE'S WEDDING IS GOING TO BE A PROPER AFFAIR, AFTER ALL. AND YOU'LL BE GOING, AFTER ALL. I'LL BE GOING, AND SO WILL YOU, MRS. RAFFERTY. OH, NOW, I COULDN'T DO THAT, MR. CONLON. WHY, I DON'T KNOW YOUR PEOPLE. WELL, YOU'LL GET TO KNOW THEM AT THE RECEPTION. WHAT CHANGED THEIR MINDS NOW? OH, THE FIRM STAND I TOOK. I TOLD THEM I WAS MOVING OUT, SO THEY CAME ROUND FAST. WOULD YOU... WOULD YOU REALLY HAVE MOVED OUT OF YOUR SISTER'S APARTMENT? WELL, PERHAPS IT WAS AN IDLE THREAT. BUT WHERE WOULD I GO? WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR NOT LIVING WITH IN-LAWS. BUT YOU LIKE LIVING WITH YOUR MARRIED DAUGHTER, DON'T YOU? ESPECIALLY NOW SHE'S NOT UNDERFOOT SINCE SHE TOOK THAT JOB WORKING ALL DAY. TRUE. I HAVE THE WHOLE PLACE TO MESELF. BUT AFTER ALL, IT'S COMPANIONABLE LIVING WITH YOUR OWN KIN, WHEN YOU'VE NO HUSBAND OR WIFE OF YOUR OWN. I'VE BEEN A WIDOW A LONG TIME. WELL, BETTER TO HAVE LOVED AND LOST, AS THEY SAY. OH? OH, YES. OF COURSE, I MESELF, I BELONG TO A LONG LINE OF BACHELORS. THAT IS TO SAY, ME UNCLES WERE ALL BACHELORS. IT'S A MATTER OF PRIDE IN A MAN, AVOIDING THE PITFALLS OF MATRIMONY. I'VE GOT 3 BACHELOR BROTHERS LIVING TOGETHER BACK IN THE COUNTY LIMERICK. WELL, THINK OF THAT. ME SISTER MARY WAS BORN HERE FIRST, THEN AGGIE. AH, YOU'D HAVE LOVED MARY. I'M SURE I WOULD. SHE KEPT HOUSE FOR ME FOR 20 YEARS AND NEVER GOT MARRIED HERSELF. OH, A STRIKING GIRL. WEIGHED NEAR 200 POUNDS. MY, MY, MY. A FINE, BIG, JOLLY GIRL WITH A SMILE LIKE THE MORNING. YES. SHE DROPPED DEAD ONE NIGHT LISTENING TO A JOKE I WAS TELLING... YOU KNOW, THE ONE ABOUT THE LADY MISSIONARY AND THE CANNIBALS. OH, THAT ONE! HO HO HO! KEELED OVER DEAD. A FINE WAY TO GO... LAUGHING AT A FUNNY STORY WITH A BOTTLE OF BEER IN YOUR HANDS. IT WAS THAT. WELL, MRS. RAFFERTY, SHALL WE WHIP UP A GAME? I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT SUGGEST IT. I FEEL LUCK IN ME BONES TODAY. WILL IT BE ONE OR TWO CANASTAS TO GO OUT? UH, LET'S PLAY TWO AND PICK UP TWO CARDS. GOOD. AND HOW DOES THE COUNT STAND OF US NOW? UH, I AM IN DEBT TO YOU TO THE AMOUNT OF...$24,700. WELL, THEN LET'S SEE IF WE CAN MAKE IT AN EVEN 25,000. OW! OH, SORRY, MISS. HOLD YOUR BREATH IN. I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO BREATHE IN THIS THING. YOU WANT NO WAIST, I'LL GIVE YOU NO WAIST. WE CAN ALWAYS LET IT OUT AFTER THE WEDDING IF WE WANT TO USE THE GOWN FOR A FORMAL. A FORMAL? WELL, YOU WOULDN'T WANT ALL THIS EXPENSE JUST FOR ONE TIME, WOULD YOU? IS THAT ALL, MR. MEYER? Tailor: THAT'S ALL. WHERE'S ALICE? I THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE WAS GONNA MEET YOU HERE. SHE'LL BE ALONG. YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID WHEN I TOLD HER I WAS GETTING MARRIED? SHE SAID, "SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?" IT SOUNDED FUNNY THE WAY SHE SAID IT OVER THE TELEPHONE. I KNOW ONE THING: I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND WHEN PA FINDS OUT THIS DRESS ALONE IS GONNA COST $120. HELLO, ALICE. ALICE, LOOK. OH, JANE, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF WE COULD DRESS UP LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME? I WONDER HOW IT WOULD LOOK ON ME. YOU GOT TO ADMIT IT'S KIND OF STYLISH, LIKE I ALWAYS DRESS. NOW ALICE HERE'S GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE'S GONNA WEAR. I WAS THINKING ROSE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT WITH THIS. YEAH, I... I... WELL, HERE ARE THE SHOES WE WANTED. THIS IS ALICE SCANLON. SHE'S GOING TO BE MY MATRON OF HONOR. WELL, I'M SURE WE CAN FIND SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR OUR MATRON OF HONOR. COME ON, YOU'LL LOVE BLUE. COME ON, LET'S GO LOOK FOR OUR DRESS. NO, NOT RIGHT NOW. WELL, YOU GO AHEAD WHILE I CHANGE. SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW, SOMETHING BORROWED, SOMETHING BLUE. IT'S BEEN NICE SHOPPING TOGETHER. WE NEVER DID THAT BEFORE. I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M VERY SORRY WE NEVER WENT SHOPPING TOGETHER BEFORE, JANE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, JANE? I MEAN I'M VERY SORRY I DIDN'T TAKE MORE INTEREST IN YOU WHEN YOU WAS A LITTLE GIRL. I WAS ALWAYS... WELL, WE HAD THE CURSE OF MONEY OVER US ALL OUR LIVES, YOUR PA AND ME. YOU'RE SPENDING A LOT TODAY. IT WAS YOUR IDEA. REMEMBER THAT WHEN HE HITS THE CEILING. WELL, ALL HE HAS TO DO IS THINK HOW WE WAS MARRIED. THE ONLY REASON HE MARRIED ME WAS THAT MY FATHER, GOD REST HIS SOUL, MET HIM ONE DAY AT THE UNION HALL. THEY WAS BOTH HOUSE PAINTERS, YOU KNOW. AND HE SAID, "HURLEY, I'LL GIVE YOU $300 IF YOU'LL MARRY MY DAUGHTER." AND HE SAID HE WOULD, AND HE DID. WHY, I NEVER HEARD THAT STORY, MA. OH, SURE, SURE. OF COURSE I'M EXAGGERATING A LITTLE, BUT... BUT THAT'S THE GIST OF IT. OH, HE'S A GOOD MAN, YOUR FATHER. WHEN TERRENCE WAS KILLED IN KOREA, I THINK I'D HAVE DIED MYSELF, IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE STEADINESS OF YOUR FATHER. BUT HE'S A VERY CLOSE MAN WITH THE MONEY. I NEVER KNEW THAT STORY ABOUT YOU AND PA. OH, I THOUGHT YOU KNEW. JANE, WE WAS NEVER VERY CLOSE. IT'S ALL MY FAULT. NO REPROACH TO YOU. BUT WHEN YOU START GETTING ON LIKE ME, YOU START LOOKING BACK AT THINGS. LOOK, THIS IS DUMB. DON'T LISTEN TO A WORD I SAID. COME ON. I GOT A MILLION THINGS TO DO. WE FOUND HER THIS LOVELY BLUE ORGANDY, BUT SHE FEELS IT DOESN'T SUIT HER. I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT AT LUNCH, JANE. WE DID WANT SOMETHING IN ROSE. WHO DO I MAKE THE DEPOSIT TO? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. YOU GO ON, GIRLS. I GOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT. ALL RIGHT, MA. SEE YOU TONIGHT. I'M GONNA HAVE DINNER WITH RALPH. YEAH? WELL, DON'T STAY OUT TO ALL HOURS. OH, JANE, JANE, THE DEPOSIT'S GONNA CLEAN ME UP. COULD I HAVE $1.00 FOR BUS FARE? OH, SURE. THAT BE ENOUGH? YEAH, SURE. THANKS. OK. NICE TO HAVE SEEN YOU, ALICE. NICE TO HAVE SEEN YOU. I'LL GET YOU THE $1.00 BACK TOMORROW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT PA'S GONNA DO WHEN HE FINDS OUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE SPENT, BUT AT THIS POINT, I DON'T CARE. I MEAN, IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BIG WEDDING, LET'S HAVE ONE. TWO COFFEES, PLEASE. OH, BEFORE I FORGET, LET'S MAKE A LIST OF BRIDESMAIDS. I WROTE DOWN SOME NAMES LAST NIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, WE GOT TO HAVE MARY ELIZABETH... YOU KNOW, BECAUSE SHE HAD US AS HER BRIDESMAIDS. SHE'S A WONDERFUL GIRL. JANE... JANE, I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR MATRON OF HONOR. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU GOT SWEAR TO GOD YOU'LL NEVER TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE I... WHY, ALICE, WHAT'S THE MATTER? OH, JANE, I... I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW ASHAMED I FEEL ABOUT THIS, BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND ON THAT BLUE ORGANDY OR ANYTHING ELSE. OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE... THAT DRESS ALONE COSTS $35, JANE, AND YOU... YOU KNOW BILL'S OUT OF WORK. HE DON'T EVEN SLEEP NIGHTS NOW WITH WORRY. WE HAVEN'T GOT ONE CENT. BUT LOOK, ALICE... AND EVEN IF I COULD AFFORD THE DRESS, BILL HAS GOT TO HAVE A TUXEDO. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WEAR A TUXEDO. IF I WEAR THE GOWN, HE'S GOT TO WEAR A TUXEDO. THAT COSTS $15, $20 TO RENT. HE DOESN'T NEED TO WEAR ANY TUXEDO, JUST A PLAIN BLUE SUIT. HE DON'T HAVE A BLUE SUIT. DON'T YOU REMEMBER? I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK HOW EMBARRASSED I WAS HE DON'T EVEN HAVE A BLUE SUIT. ALICE, THE TROUBLE WITH YOU IS YOU'RE TOO ASHAMED OF THESE THINGS. SO HE HAS TO GO OUT AND GET A BLUE SUIT. THAT WILL COST HIM 60 BUCKS, AND THAT BLUE ORGANDY IS 35 BUCKS, AND I... I GOT TO HAVE SHOES TO MATCH THE DRESS, AND A BAG TO MATCH THE SHOES, AND... SO... FOR ME TO BE YOUR MATRON OF HONOR IS GONNA COST BILL AND ME $100, AND... WE... WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT. AND THAT'S THAT. PLEASE, DON'T EVER TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS. YOU'RE BROKE. WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE? JANE, I'M VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT THIS, YOU KNOW THAT. ALICE, I CAN LOAN YOU THE MONEY FOR THE DRESS. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. ALICE, DON'T BE SO TOUCHY. JANE, YOU SAY ONE MORE WORD, I GOT TO GET UP AND GET OUT OF HERE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. ALICE... LEAVE ME ALONE. I ARRIVED A BIT EARLY. SORT OF EXAMINING THE PREMISES, YOU MIGHT SAY. WHERE'S AGGIE? I THOUGHT SHE WAS COMING WITH YOU. NO. YOU SEE THE MANAGER YET? HE'S INSIDE HIS OFFICE, WAITING FOR US. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, AT THAT. ISN'T THAT MAGNIFICENT? IT'S GONNA COST A MINT. I WAS SO FAR DOWNTOWN. ISN'T IT GRAND? WELL, LET'S GET IT OVER WITH. I GOT TO BE GOING SOON, HUH? OH, JACK, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN JANEY AND ME TODAY. IT WAS SOMETHING. WE PICKED OUT A LACE WEDDING DRESS WITH A VEIL RIGHT DOWN TO THE FLOOR. SOUNDS MIGHTY FINE. OH, IT WAS SOMETHING. SHE LOOKED JUST LIKE... IF YOU DON'T MIND, I GOT JUST SO MUCH TIME, SO WE'LL SEE THE MANAGER NOW AND GET THE BAD NEWS, HUH? I WAS JUST TELLING JACK SOMETHING. AND THIS VEIL GOES RIGHT OUT TO HERE, IT'S ALL KIND OF A TULLE KIND OF THING WITH ORANGE BLOSSOMS ON THE TOP. MRS. HURLEY, I'M PLEASED TO SEE YOU. MR. CONLON, WE ALREADY MET. MR. HURLEY. WE'VE COME TO TALK ABOUT OUR DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. YES, I KNOW. NOW I GOT TOGETHER A FEW THINGS... OUR RATES AND SO ON. HOW MUCH THIS GONNA COST? WELL, FIRST I HAVE TO HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND, ALSO THE NEXT AVAILABILITY OF THE BALLROOM. HOW MUCH WILL THIS COME TO? WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE FOR THE WEDDING BREAKFAST. NOW, HERE ARE SOME PICTURES OF ONE OF OUR BUFFETS, BY THE WAY. HOW MANY DO YOU THINK, TOM? CLOSE TO 200, I'D SAY. TWO HUN... YEAH. WHERE DO YOU GET 200? WE DON'T EVEN KNOW 50 PEOPLE. WE GOT TO CUT THE LIST DOWN AS IT IS. BUT 200 PEOPLE? HOW DO YOU GET 200 PEOPLE? EXCUSE ME. Manager: OH, YES, YES, OF COURSE. NOW LOOK, TOM, THERE'S HARRY AND BOBBY AND JOE, AND ALL OF THAT CROWD. OH, AND THEN THERE'S THE DENNISONS, THERE MUST BE 18 OF THEM. AND THEN WHAT ABOUT YOUR BROTHER JACK? OH, AND THEN THERE'S HARRY, AND THEN HELEN... HARRY'S NOT COMING ALL THE WAY UP FROM WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA. OH, SURE HE WILL. AND THE COUSINS, WHAT ABOUT THEM? AND JANE MUST HAVE SOME FRIENDS OF HER OWN SHE'LL WANT. WHY, THERE COULD BE MORE 150 THAN 100. I THOUGHT THEY WAS JUST BEING INVITED TO THE CHURCH. I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GONNA PAY FOR THEIR BREAKFAST, TOO. WELL, JUST LET'S SAY, IN ROUND NUMBERS, 100 FOR US AND 100 FOR THE GROOM. HOW MUCH WOULD THAT BE? WELL, NOW, THE BREAKFAST IS $5.00 APIECE. NOW THERE ARE THE FLOWERS, OF COURSE. HERE ARE SOME MODELS OF OUR TABLE DECORATIONS. THIS IS THE SINGLE, AND THIS IS THE DOUBLE. THIS ONE'S $20 APIECE. YOU SEE, YOU GET FROM US THE BALLROOM, THE BREAKFAST, AND THE CATERING. NOW, IF YOU WANT HOT AND COLD HORS D'OEUVRES, LIQUOR, PHOTOGRAPHERS, LIMOUSINE SERVICE, FLOWERS... LIMOUSINE SERVICE? LIMOUSINE... GREAT IDEA. WELL, TOM, YOU GOT TO DRIVE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T GOT ANY CARS FROM THE CHURCH HERE. OF COURSE. IT'S NOT SO AWFUL FAR. JUST 20, 30 BLOCKS BY SUBWAY. EXCUSE ME. TOM, IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AT ALL, WE MIGHT AS WELL DO IT RIGHT. LOOK, AGGIE, THERE'S $4,400 IN THE BANK THAT I SCRIMPED AND SAVED FOR FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS TO GET MY OWN CAB. YOU SCRIMPED? WHAT ABOUT ME? SO WE BOTH DID. SO I CAN'T SEE THROWING AWAY $4,400 ON ONE MEAL. I'M WILLING TO GIVE THE GIRL A FANCY PARTY, BUT THROWING AWAY OUR WHOLE LIFE SAVINGS ON ONE MEAL, AND A BREAKFAST, AT THAT... NO! YOU SKIMPED ON ME ALL MY LIFE. YOU'LL NOT SKIMP ON THAT GIRL. I DONE THE BEST I COULD FOR MY KIDS. LOOK, TOM, WE'VE HAD IT HARD BETWEEN US, BUT I'LL NOT HAGGLE AND BICKER WITH YOU NOW. THIS GIRL'S GOING TO HAVE A WEDDING SHE'LL REMEMBER TILL THE DAY SHE DIES. SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG, WHITE, SATIN PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM THAT SHE CAN LOOK AT WHEN THE BAD YEARS COME. AND MAYBE THEN SHE'LL HAVE A KIND THOUGHT FOR HER FATHER AND MOTHER... WHO NEVER GIVEN HER NOTHING AT ALL. AND YOU'RE AS BAD AS ME. BUT THIS SHE'S GOING TO HAVE, I'LL TELL YOU THAT. SO WE DECIDED TO HOLD THE WAKE IN THE GREEN GRASS GRILL. Man: THAT'S VERY FUNNY, INDEED! WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING THE GUEST LIST. IF YOU'D LIKE TO THINK IT OVER AND COME BACK ANOTHER TIME... NO, NO, THIS IS THE PLACE. FINE. NOW, ABOUT THE FLORAL DECORATIONS... DON'T WE GET SENT FLOWERS AT A WEDDING? COULDN'T WE JUST TAKE THE FLOWERS WE GET DOWN HERE AFTER THE SERVICE? TOM, YOU CAN'T TAKE THEM OUT OF THE CHURCH. TOM, WHEN YOU PUT A FLOWER IN THE CHURCH... YES. NOW, ABOUT THE LIMOUSINE SERVICE... HOW MANY CAN YOU SQUEEZE INTO ONE OF THEM LIMOUSINES? WELL, I'D SAY ABOUT 10, I GUESS, SPEAKING OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. THEN WE'LL HAVE 10 LIMOUSINES. THEN 100 CAN RIDE. 10?! THESE ARE THE WEDDING CAKE ORNAMENTS. HOW MUCH WOULD THAT BE? WELL, I THINK WE'D BETTER START AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. LET'S SEE, NOW... 6 GALLONS OF ASSORTED COCKTAILS AT $28 A GALLON, 28 BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE FOR THE TOAST AT $6.00 A BOTTLE, 12 BOTTLES OF RYE AT $8.00 A BOTTLE, 12 BOTTLES OF SCOTCH AT $11 A BOTTLE... 10 LIMOUSINES, AN ORCHESTRA, FLOWERS... AND THE BRIDAL TABLE FLOWERS, $20. CENTERPIECES FOR ALL THE OTHERS, $20 APIECE, YES. 15% ON THE FOOD TIP, 20 CENTS PER PERSON FOR THE CHECKROOM. 200 MATCHBOOKS... THAT WOULD BE $14. WEDDING ALBUM, 25 PICTURES, THAT'S $75. LIMOUSINE SERVICE... ANYWAY, WHEN SHE SAID BILL DIDN'T HAVE A BLUE SUIT, WELL, SHE STARTED CRYING. OH, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR BEST FRIEND JUST BREAKS DOWN AND CRIES? I DON'T KNOW, HONEY. WE'RE IN THE SAME TRAP. I KNOW BILL DIDN'T HAVE A JOB. YOU KNEW HOW ALICE FELT ABOUT THINGS. THE THING IS, WHY DIDN'T WE THINK ABOUT IT BEFORE WE HURT THEIR FEELINGS? IT'S GETTING TO BE SUCH A MESS. OH! WHY DON'T YOU FIX THIS THING? IT SPRAYS ALL OVER THE PLACE. WELL, JUST WAIT TILL YOU HEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE MY FOLKS ASKED TO THE PARTY YOUR OLD MAN'S PAYING FOR. AS OF THIS AFTERNOON, MY MOTHER FOUND WE'RE RELATED BY BLOOD TO 46 PEOPLE, AND BY MARRIAGE TO 81. AND ON TOP OF THAT, THERE ARE SOME 40-ODD CLOSE FRIENDS WHO DESERVE THE RARE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING ME MARRY YOU. THAT'S OVER 150 ALREADY! AW, JANIE, LET'S LEAVE TUESDAY LIKE WE PLANNED. LEAVE? LEAVE! WHAT ABOUT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS? CANCEL THEM! IT WON'T KILL ANYBODY! RALPH... LISTEN, JANIE... RALPH, I CAN'T, THAT'S ALL. RALPH, I WANT TO DO IT FOR MA, THAT'S ALL. WHAT DO YOU DO TO YOUR SHIRTS, LOSING THE BUTTONS ALL THE TIME? RALPH... I WAS WONDERING TODAY... LISTENING TO MA... IF SHE AND PA EVER SAID THEY LOVED EACH OTHER. I DON'T THINK THEY EVER DID. I KNOW THEY NEVER DID. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING YOU SAY. IT'S SOMETHING YOU DO. IT'S THE WHOLE WAY YOU LIVE. THAT'S LOVE. I KNOW. I KNOW, BUT... SOMETIMES IF THINGS AREN'T SAID, AFTER A WHILE, THEY AREN'T TRUE ANYMORE. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE. YOU MEAN I NEVER TOLD YOU WHAT I FEEL ABOUT YOU? YES. OH, YES... BUT DON'T EVER STOP TELLING ME. IF WE'RE GOING TO THE MOVIES, WE'D BETTER GET GOING, HUH? HMM... YOU REALLY WANT TO GO? HMM... I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU WANT TO GO? WELL, IF YOU WANT TO GO... JANIE... DEAR... RALPH... I THINK WE BETTER GO TO THE MOVIES. YOU'RE UP EARLY, MA. YEAH. I'M GOING OVER THE GUEST LIST, AND GUESS WHAT. WE'RE IN TROUBLE? I GOT THE LIST DOWN TO 94 FOR OUR SIDE. THAT'S A SAVING OF $30. TOM, I SAVED US $30. HOW? WE'RE INVITING 94 PEOPLE INSTEAD OF THE 100. OUR 94 AND THE HALLORAN'S 100... OH, NO. MA. WHAT? RALPH TOLD ME HIS MOTHER'S INVITING ABOUT... 160 PEOPLE. HOW MANY? 160?! BUT I TOLD HER THERE'D BE 100 FOR EACH OF US. I MADE A BIG THING YESTERDAY. 160, YOU SAID? RALPH'S MAD ABOUT IT, TOO. WHAT IS 160 TIMES 5?DON'T CARRY ON! I'M ASKING FOR A BIT OF INFORMATION. WHAT IS 160 TIMES 5? NOW, TOM, RALPH MUST BE WRONG. 160 TIMES 5 ON TOP OF $3,100 ALREADY TO BE THROWN DOWN THE DRAIN ON THIS CRIMINAL BREAKFAST WE'RE SERVING A BUNCH OF STRANGERS! NOW, TOM, RELAX A MINUTE. I'LL CALL MRS.

MA, MAYBE WE BETTER CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF. NO, I WON'T. ANYWAY, WE CAN'T. RALPH MUST BE WRONG. MRS. HALLORAN? THIS IS AGNES HURLEY. OH, YEAH, WE'RE FINE. AND HOW ARE YOU? WELL, THAT'S NICE. LOOK, I WAS JUST GOING OVER MY LIST, AND I WAS... I WAS WONDERING ABOUT YOUR LIST. OH, SURE, I KNOW WE WON'T BE INVITING THE SAME PEOPLE, BUT... HOW MANY DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ASKING? 186?! 186?!

NOTHING WAS EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU! STOP IT, BOTH OF YOU! FRIDAY WE DECIDED TO HAVE A BIG WEDDING, AND IN TWO DAYS, MY BEST FRIEND ALICE HATES ME, MY UNCLE IS MOVING OUT, MY MOTHER AND FATHER ARE BREAKING UP! I'VE LOST MY HONEYMOON, PA'S LOST HIS CAB, AND RALPH IS SO SORE, HE MAY WALK OUT ON THE WHOLE THING! SO... LET'S CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF! I KNOW WE PUT $50 DOWN ON THE BALLROOM AND $50 DOWN ON THE BRIDAL GOWN... $50?! FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN, IF IT'S $50 DOWN, HOW MUCH WILL THIS COME TO? OK! OK, WE'RE CALLING IT OFF! BUT THE INVITATIONS WENT OUT THIS MORNING. THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WRITE EVERYBODY AND SAY THE PLANS WERE CHANGED! AND YOUR UNCLE HARRY'S COMING UP FROM VIRGINIA. OK, SO MAYBE IT'S EMBARRASSING, BUT IT'S A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN HAVING PA GO BROKE AND RALPH AND ME LOSE OUR HONEYMOON! ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, WE WON'T HAVE A WEDDING! ALL RIGHT. MA, I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WANTED THE BIG WEDDING, AND I APPRECIATE IT. I SWEAR I DO. ALL RIGHT. I'LL CALL THE HALLORANS. NO. I'LL CALL THEM. IT'S MY PLACE TO CALL THEM. WELL, I'LL... I'LL GO CALL HALLORAN. MA... GET YOUR CLOTHES. IT'S TIME FOR MASS. MRS. HALLORAN? NO CONSIDERATION. NO GRATITUDE. NO LOYALTY. VANITY... ALL THE TIME, VANITY. HELLO THERE, JACK. HELLO THERE. YOU LOOK QUITE HEARTY, MR. CONLON. WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS LAST HOUR HAS AGED ME 100 YEARS. JIGGER OF RYE, JIMMY! ISN'T IT A BIT EARLY FOR YOU, MR. CONLON? IT'S THE HEART... BAD PALPITATION BROUGHT ON BY THE UNKINDNESS OF OTHERS. WHAT HAPPENED? I'M LEAVING THAT HOUSE FOR GOOD AND ALL! OH? NO CONSIDERATION. NO GRATITUDE. NO LOYALTY. THAT DOES SOUND BAD. AH, MRS. RAFFERTY, TODAY I'VE SEEN ALL THE BLACKNESS OF THE HUMAN HEART. AND IT HAD TO DO WITH YOUR INVITING ME. IT HAD. I APPRECIATE THAT, MR. CONLON. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT SISTER OF MINE IS LOSING HER SENSES. I WAS THE ONE WHO PLANNED THE WEDDING. I WAS THE ONE WHO MADE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS, WHO INTERVIEWED THE CATERERS. AND ME REWARD? I ASK TO BRING ME BEST FRIEND IN ALL THE WORLD... AND THUS THIS UGLY QUARREL. OH, WELL... IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT AGAIN SOON. BUT I'M STILL MOVING OUT! BUT WHERE ON EARTH WILL I GO? WELL... IT JUST HAPPENS I KNOW THIS PLACE NOT A STONE'S THROW FROM WHERE WE'RE SITTING. A ROOM. A SMALL APARTMENT. AND, UH... AND... IT'S A NICE SIZE PLACE. BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO. FOR TWO, HUH? I'LL SAY NO MORE, MR. CONLON. UH, FOR TWO, DID YOU SAY, MRS. RAFFERTY? I DID. AND YOU'D BE WILLING TO LEAVE YOUR MARRIED DAUGHTER'S HOUSE? I WOULD! YEAH, AND TWO CAN LIVE AS CHEAP AS ONE. SO I'VE ALWAYS HEARD, MR. CONLON. WELL, NOW THINGS LOOK VERY BRIGHT. THEY DO, AT THAT. JIGGER OF RYE, JIMMY! SHALL WE HAVE A BIT OF A GAME? YES, LET'S HAVE A GAME TO CELEBRATE. TWO CANASTAS TO GO OUT? AND PICK UP TWO CARDS. WELL, IT'S A GRAND DAY AFTER ALL, MRS. RAFFERTY. IT IS, MR. CONLON. HI. HI. HI, ALICE, BILL. HOW ARE YOU, BILL? HOW YOU DOING, ROB? FINE, JUST FINE, BILL. COME ON, NOW, WHAT'S SO EXCITING YOU COULDN'T TELL ME ON THE PHONE? A JOB. BILL HAS A JOB WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY. YEAH, THE ONE I PUT IN FOR LAST YEAR CAME THROUGH... FINALLY CAME THROUGH. GREAT. SO I CAN GET THE DRESS, AND BILL CAN GET THE SUIT, AND I CAN BE YOUR MATRON OF HONOR LIKE WE ALWAYS PLANNED. ALICE... ALICE, THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY BIG WEDDINGS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT WAS ALL SET. WELL, WE'RE GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW, LIKE WE ALWAYS PLANNED. I WAS GOING TO CALL YOU TONIGHT TO TELL YOU. JUST WEAR... WHAT YOU ALWAYS WEAR. GEE, IT'S KIND OF A SHAME, ISN'T IT? WHAT'S A SHAME? Alice: NOT HAVING THE BIG WEDDING AND ALL. JANE, YOUR MOTHER... IT'S OK WITH HER? OH, SURE. SURE, IT IS. MA'S THE PRACTICAL ONE IN THE FAMILY. IT WAS HER IDEA TO CALL IT OFF. LET'S DANCE, OK? SURE. HE HASN'T GOT A JOB. NO, I KNOW. THEY PROBABLY BORROWED THE MONEY FOR THE ORGANDY DRESS AND THE BLUE SUIT. JANIE... JANIE, DARLING... YOUR MA WILL BE ALL RIGHT. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE LOOK ON HER FACE WHEN I TOLD HER WE WEREN'T HAVING A BIG WEDDING. I'LL NEVER FORGET THE WAY SHE LOOKED... LIKE I'D HIT HER IN THE FACE. SHH, HONEY. HONEY... AND I KEEP THINKING ABOUT THAT HOUSE... THE TWO OF THEM ALONE... LIVING THERE THE REST OF THEIR LIVES... NEVER TALKING... NEVER LOVING EACH OTHER... RALPH... WE WILL NEVER BE LIKE THAT. NO, HONEY. NO, NO. WHY, HELLO THERE, TOM. IS AGGIE ABOUT? SHE'S IN THE BEDROOM. ARE YOU REALLY MOVING OUT? YES, SIR. JACK CONLON'S WORD IS AS GOOD AS HIS BOND. JACK, I... WELL, I GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT. WELL, I TELL YOU, I THINK WE'D BE A LITTLE PINCHED FOR SPACE WITH YOU AND AGGIE AND ME AND MRS. CONLON. MRS. CONLON?! YES, SIR. MRS. RAFFERTY HAS FINALLY CONSENTED TO BE ME WIFE. WHY, JACK, THAT'S WONDERFUL! I'M GLAD TO HEAR THE NEWS! YES, I'VE DECIDED TO NARROW ME ACTIVITIES FROM THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD DOWN TO MRS. RAFFERTY. I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D HAVE THE NERVE! IT WAS QUITE PAINLESS... ALMOST. I DIDN'T FEEL A THING. OH, AGGIE! JACK'S GETTING MARRIED! WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE NEWS, AGGIE? WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE. WE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME BEER TO CELEBRATE. Jack: SOME OTHER TIME. YOU SEE, WE'RE MOVING INTO THE NEW APARTMENT TONIGHT. THIS IS A SURPRISE. YEAH, THERE IS THAT ELEMENT IN IT, ISN'T THERE? WHERE IS THE PLACE YOU'RE MOVING TO? IT'S ABOUT 6 BLOCKS AS THE CROW FLIES, AND WE'LL BE OVER OFTEN ENOUGH. AND YOU'LL COME OVER TO SEE US, TOO, I HOPE. Tom: OH, SURE. YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE MY DECISION IN RELATION TO MRS. RAFFERTY, I'VE BEEN SEEING THINGS IN WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A NEW LIGHT. WHAT AM I, I ASK YOU, AFTER 61 YEARS? AN UNCLE, THAT'S ALL. NO CHILDREN, NO GRANDCHILDREN, NO WIFE OF ME OWN, NO HOME WHERE I BELONG, NO... BUT, JACK, THIS IS YOUR HOME. AH, NO, AGGIE. IT'S YOURS AND TOM'S. I'VE JUST BEEN SCAVENGING HERE FOR A BIT OF WARMTH I SHOULD HAVE FOUND LONG AGO WITH SOMEBODY LIKE MRS. RAFFERTY. AND, YOU KNOW, IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS BREAK-UP, I'D HAVE GONE ON BEING JUST AN UNCLE FOR THE REST OF ME DAYS. LOOK, YOU'RE NOT RUSHING INTO THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED? THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY BIG WEDDING, YOU KNOW. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE LIKE IT WAS BEFORE. SURE, IT IS. SURE, IT IS. AND WE'LL BE NEARBY, HOPPING OVER WHENEVER YOU LIKE. EATING IN MOSTLY, BECAUSE THESE RESTAURANTS HAVE ALL THAT FRIED FOOD THAT DON'T AGREE WITH ME AT ALL. LOOK, AGGIE, FOR SOME PECULIAR REASON, THE WORLD SEEMS TO BE DIVIDED INTO PAIRS. THERE'S LITTLE JANIE AND HER RALPH, THERE'S ME AND MRS. RAFFERTY, AND THERE'S YOU AND TOM. YOU'VE GOT HIM, AND HE'S GOT YOU. YEAH, THAT'S FINE, JACK. WELL, AGGIE, ME GIRL, I'M ON ME WAY. AGGIE? I'LL TALK TO HER, JACK. WELL, I'LL SEE YOU AT THE CHURCH. OK. AGGIE? AGGIE... WELL... WELL, THAT WAS A DUMB THING TO DO. MMM... FEEL ALL RIGHT NOW? SURE. SURE. JACK GONE? YEAH, HE'S GONE. TURN AROUND. JANE... NOT HOME YET? NO. AGGIE, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? I CRIED, FOR PETE'S SAKE, THAT'S ALL. I CRIED! SO WHAT? AGGIE, DON'T FEEL... I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT NONE OF IT. AGGIE, YOU'VE GONE RIGHT OFF YOUR ROCKER ABOUT THIS WEDDING. IT'S NOT THE WEDDING! YOU'RE A SENSELESS AND STUPID MAN. YOU DON'T CARE YOUR DAUGHTER'S GETTING MARRIED... NOT A LIVING THING! ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT! I JUST WANTED TO DO A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR HER. THE SAME TUNE FOR ALL THESE YEARS, AND I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING IT! THAT'S ALL I EVER GET OUT OF YOU IS THE SHARP EDGE OF YOUR TONGUE. IT'S ALWAYS ME, IT'S ALWAYS MY FAULT. YOU'RE THE GOOD, THE NEVER-FAILING ONE. THEY'LL BE THINKING OF CANONIZING YOU! WELL, HEAR ME NOW, AGGIE: YOU'RE NO FANCY BARGAIN, I CAN TELL YOU THAT! YOU GOT YOUR $300 WORTH! DON'T YOU EVER MENTION THAT $300 TO ME AGAIN, YOU HEAR ME? I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING IT! YOU THINK YOU HAD IT SO BAD? WELL, LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ME, ABOUT THE TIMES I WANTED TO QUIT THE WHOLE BUSINESS, PACK A BAG AND GO OUT TO ARIZONA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT... THE TIMES I PUT THE HACK IN THE GARAGE, READY AND WILLING TO THROW THE WHOLE BUSINESS! FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I WANT TO GIVE THE GIRL A DECENT WEDDING? AND DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A LIVING SHAME THAT MY ONLY LIVING DAUGHTER COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS, "I WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE," AND I HAD TO SAY TO HER, "NO. GO GET A JOB. WE NEED THE MONEY." I COULD HEAR YOU OUTSIDE IN THE HALL. GO TO BED. THIS IS BETWEEN YOUR MOTHER AND ME. THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY BIG WEDDING. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WEDDING! NOW, GO TO BED AND CLOSE THE DOOR! MA... GO TO BED. YOU HAD YOUR SISTER MARY LIVE WITH US, THEN YOUR BROTHER JACK FOR 12 YEARS, AND IT WAS ALWAYS TO MAKE THEM HAPPY. THEN IT WAS TO MAKE THE KIDS HAPPY. AND THERE WAS NOTHING, BUT TERRENCE GOT TO GO TO MILITARY SCHOOL. AND NOW IT'S THIS WEDDING TO MAKE THE GIRL HAPPY. WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME? I'M YOUR HUSBAND. WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING TO MAKE ME HAPPY? JANE'S GETTING MARRIED, EDDIE WILL BE IN THE DRAFT ANY DAY, YOUR BROTHER JACK IS MARRYING AND MOVING OUT... AND IT'S JUST ME YOU GOT LEFT IN YOUR OLD AGE. IT'S ME YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT. I TRIED TO MAKE YOU HAPPY, BUT I CAN'T AFFORD NO BIG WEDDING. WHY CAN'T YOU SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT INSTEAD OF WITH EVERYONE ELSE? PA... MA, I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM ABOUT THE WAY EVERYTHING'S BEEN, ABOUT THE BIG WEDDING BEING CALLED OFF AND UNCLE JACK MOVING OUT. HMM? I SAID I WAS SORRY. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, JANE. I KNOW HOW DISAPPOINTED YOU WERE. WELL, I JUST WANTED TO DO A LITTLE SOMETHING, THAT WAS ALL. WHERE'S YOUR PA NOW? DRINKING BEER, WITH A MEAN EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE. WELL, LET HIM BE. TURN OUT THE LIGHT, JANE. GO TO SLEEP NOW. TOMORROW'S THE BIGGEST DAY OF YOUR WHOLE LIFE. MAKE IT START GOOD. I WILL, MA. THAT'S THE WHOLE TRICK. MAKE IT START GOOD. WELL, I'M... I'M ALL PACKED. I HEARD YOU UP AT DAWN, BANGING AROUND. YEAH, I COULDN'T SLEEP ALL NIGHT LONG. I DIDN'T SLEEP SO GOOD MYSELF. HOW'S PA FEELING? WELL, THE WAY YOU'D THINK, CONSIDERING HE DRANK UP ALL THE BEER IN THE ICEBOX. HE'S STILL SLEEPING. AND HE'D REALLY BETTER BE GETTING UP SOON. IT'S 9:00, AND FATHER MURPHY STARTS AT 10:00 ON THE DOT. EDDIE? ARE YOU READY? TAKING THE SOUTHERN ROUTE OR THE NORTHERN ROUTE? THE SOUTHERN, COMING AND GOING. BECAUSE OF THE WINTER ROADS. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU'LL BE HOUSEKEEPING YOURSELF SOON. YEAH, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT. WELL, IT'S NOT THE EASIEST THING DAY AFTER DAY, BUT YOU'LL GET USED TO IT, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE. I'M SO JUMPY! I DON'T KNOW WHY. THERE'S NO REASON AT ALL. WELL, I SHOULD HOPE A GIRL ON HER WEDDING DAY SHOULD BE A LITTLE JUMPY. THAT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF. IT'S FUNNY. WE WAS NEVER ALONE. YOUR PA AND ME WAS NEVER ALONE TOGETHER FROM THAT FIRST DAY WE WAS MARRIED. I KNOW, MA. IT'S A FUNNY THING. THERE WAS ALWAYS SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND. I GUESS YOU'LL MISS THEM. WE NEVER TALKED TOGETHER, YOUR PA AND ME. IN ALL THAT TIME, WE NEVER TALKED TOGETHER ONCE. WHY, SURE YOU DID. I WAS ALWAYS MINDING THE KIDS OR DOING THE HOUSEWORK, AND HE WAS OUT DRIVING THE HACK ALL DAY, AND THEN HE'D COME HOME AND EAT AND GO TO SLEEP. MAYBE UNCLE JACK WILL MOVE BACK IN AGAIN. NO. NOBODY'S EVER MOVING IN AGAIN. ALL ALONE. SOMETHING NEW, YOUR PA AND ME TOGETHER. YOU AREN'T MAD AT HIM? MAD? HOW COULD I BE MAD AT WHAT'S BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE AND WILL BE TO THE END? I'M GLAD. WELL, I'LL GET MY BAG AND PUT IT IN THE HALL. WELL, GUESS I'LL BE MOVING INTO HER ROOM TONIGHT. YEAH. GOING TO BE KIND OF QUIET AROUND HERE FOR A CHANGE, WITH UNCLE JACK AND JANE BOTH GONE. YEAH, IT'LL BE QUIET. THEN, DECEMBER 15th, I'M OFF TO FORT DIX. WELL, THERE'S NO WAR. THAT'S A BLESSING. NOT LIKE WHEN TERRENCE WENT. COME ON, EDDIE. DO UP YOUR COAT AND TIE. HURRY UP, GET GOING. WE BETTER GET STARTED, MA. I'M READY. WHAT ABOUT PA? YOU TWO GO ON. I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR PA. MA, DON'T BE LATE. DON'T WORRY. IT'S 10:00 SHARP, AND WE CAN'T KEEP FATHER MURPHY WAITING AFTER ALL HE'S DONE. Jane: EDDIE? Eddie: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO THEM? Man: RALPH, RALPH. Ralph: JUST A SECOND. BE VERY HAPPY, JANE. THANKS, ALICE. UNCLE JACK, WHERE ARE THEY? ARE THEY WITH YOU? NO. MAYBE THEY'RE NOT COMING AT ALL AFTER ALL THE FUSS THAT'S BEEN MADE. OH, DON'T BE SILLY, UNCLE JACK. OF COURSE THEY WILL. THIS IS MRS. RAFFERTY, WHO'LL SOON BE MRS. CONLON. Many happy returns of the day, I'm sure. SAME TO YOU, MRS. RAFFERTY. AND THIS IS... UH, MISTER....UH, HALLIGAN. How do you do? HOW DO YOU DO? Jack: LOOK AT THEM, THE TWO BRIDES... MAY AND SEPTEMBER. EARLY SEPTEMBER. Oh, Mr. Conlon! YES, WELL, WE'LL GET MARRIED NEXT MONTH, A SIMPLE CEREMONY. ONLY IMMEDIATE FAMILY. IT'S A GOOD DAY FOR THE WEDDING. A GOOD DAY. WHERE'S THE GIRL? GONE TO THE CHURCH. ABOUT LAST NIGHT... YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT WANTING TO DO SOMETHING, ABOUT HAVING A BIG AFFAIR FOR THE GIRL. NO, TOM, I WAS WRONG. I WAS WRONG. I PRESSED YOUR SUIT THIS MORNING. TOM, JANE'S GETTING MARRIED THIS MORNING THE WAY SHE WANTS TO, AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. THAT AND YOU AND ME BEING THERE TOGETHER AFTER THIS LONG TIME... TOGETHER IN THE CHURCH, WATCHING OUR GIRL GET MARRIED, BEGINNING THIS NEW LIFE. IT'S A LONG TIME WE'VE BEEN MARRIED. TOO LONG? TOO LONG A TIME? TO KNOW SOMEBODY? IT'S LIKE A DAY, AGGIE. GO ON, WASH YOUR FACE. WE'RE LATE. HURRY UP, TOM. MR. LEITER. SAM, THIS IS AGGIE. YEAH, ABOUT THE TAXI. TAXI, MISTER? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? TAKING YOU TO THE CHURCH IN OUR NEW CAB. RIGHT, AGNES?
