* [jet engine powering down] [Caribbean music] * [man speaking foreign language] GOOD-BYE NOW. ENJOY YOUR STAY. [indistinct chatter] THE FOUNDATION FOR WHOM I WORK SUPPORTS A BOTANIST NAMED ROBERT CAMPBELL, ONCE OF SOME NOTE. BUT ON SEPARATING FROM HIS WIFE AND LONGTIME RESEARCH PARTNER, HE'D WITHDRAWN HIS STATION DEEPER INTO THE BUSH. AND UNTIL LAST MONTH'S MESSAGE, NO ONE HAD HEARD FROM HIM IN THREE YEARS. HE ASKED FOR AN ASSISTANT AND A GAS CHROMATOGRAPH, AND POINTEDLY REFUSED TO SAY WHY. I'M SURPRISED THAT THEY SENT A WOMAN... FOR DR. CAMPBELL. PLEASE DON'T LOSE IT. WAIT A MINUTE. AREN'T YOU COMING WITH ME? I'M AFRAID HE WAS ADAMANT ABOUT THAT. TANAKI WILL GUIDE YOU FROM HERE. [gasps] [speaking native language] COME ON, YOU! GO! HYAH! COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. [grunts] WHOA. CAREFUL. ARE WE HERE? HUH? [grunts] OKAY, READY? HERE YOU GO. [grunts] INDIAN?! [insects buzzing] [distant rhythmic chanting] [rhythmic chanting grows louder] [chanting in native language] [mouths silently] OH, BOY. WHO ARE YOU? WHO AM I? WHO ARE YOU? I ASKED YOU FIRST. YOU'RE DR. CAMPBELL, RIGHT? I KNOW WHO THE HELL I AM. I'M ASKING WHO YOU ARE. CRANE. NO, NO, TOUCAN. NO, THAT'S MY NAME. TOUCAN? HOW ODD. CRANE. DR. RAE CRANE. I DO WISH YOU'D MAKE UP YOUR MIND. NOW WHERE DID YOU GO? MAYBE IT'S BEST WE TALK IN THE MORNING, DOCTOR. THIS IS FROM ORNEGA. HOW ABOUT A PLACE TO SLEEP? ORNEGA? YOU FROM ASTON? THEY SENT YOU? I TELL YOU THEY SEND A GIRL. THEY SENT A GIRL? YES. [chuckles] I'M NOT A GIRL! THE HELL YOU'RE NOT. I'M YOUR RESEARCH ASSISTANT. THE HELL YOU ARE. AND WHERE'S YOUR MASK? I DON'T HAVE A MASK. I JUST GOT HERE. NO ONE COMES IN HERE WITHOUT A SURGICAL MASK. GOD KNOWS WHAT BUGS YOU'RE CARRYING. JAHAUSA, GET HER A MASK. HEY, RELAX. THIS IS AS CLOSE AS WE GET, TONTO. NOT FOR ME, YOU HUSSY! FOR THE INDIANS! HUSSY?! ONE OUTSIDER COMING IN HERE WITH A COMMON COLD CAN DECIMATE AN ENTIRE TRIBE. AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHOTS? WHAT ABOUT A PLACE TO SLEEP, GOD DAMN IT? TO SLEEP?! SLEEP! OH. UM, SLEEP...WELL... YES, OF COURSE. PLEASE FORGIVE ME. THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO LEAVE TILL TOMORROW. [chuckles] I MUST TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THESE. THEY GET LOST IN THE FOREST, YOU SEE? THE FOREST IS SO VAST AND-- AND WE'RE JUST SO VERY SMALL. [voice trailing off indistinctly] DR. CAMPBELL? [indistinct chatter] [man yelling in native language] AH, NO, NO, NO, PALALA. BACK TO THE BOAT. BACK, BACK. HEY! BACK IT UP. BACK IT UP. YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO UNPACK THAT EQUIPMENT. WHERE YOU GOING? NO, NO, NO. NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. HE'S LOADING THE BOAT. NO, NO BOAT. PALALA, ONLY THOSE BOXES ARE STAYING. NO, NO, COME ON. COME ON. UP, UP. UP, DOWN. LUGGAGE DOWN. COME ON, PUT IT DOWN. HEY, WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR AND ASK HIM TO PUT MY LUGGAGE DOWN? [speaks foreign language] SORRY. I FORGOT WOMEN LIKE TO CARRY THEIR OWN NOW. I THINK I SHOULD INTRODUCE MYSELF. WELL, YOU'RE THE SO-CALLED RESEARCH ASSISTANT FROM ASTON, HMM? HUH, YOU REMEMBER LAST NIGHT? DO I APPEAR SENILE? DRUNK. INTOXICATED, YES. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. THE PEACH PALM FESTIVAL IS THE RELIGIOUS CEREMONY. ARE THOSE BAGS TOO HEAVY? SHALL I CALL PALALA BACK? NO. I'M NOT GETTING ON A BOAT. NO BOAT. I'M AFRAID IT'S THE ONLY AVAILABLE TRANSPORT, AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T REMAIN HERE. WHY, BECAUSE I'M NOT A MAN? BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THREE MEN. I REQUESTED DR. ALAN SEALOVE, AND IF HE WAS UNAVAILABLE, DR. GREGORY HOFFMAN. [scoffs] I'M PUBLISHED MORE EXTENSIVELY THAN DR. SEALOVE. I HOLD DEGREES FROM CCNY, BERKELEY, AND CAMBRIDGE. I'M THE RECIPIENT OF THE THURMAN AWARD... IN '82 AND '86. THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME IT'S EVER BEEN GIVEN TO THE SAME PERSON TWICE. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT ME? DO THOSE BOOTS COME WITH A MANUAL? NO. I THOUGHT OF SNAKES. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU DID FIELD RESEARCH? OR WHEN'S THE FIRST TIME? I DID A MONTH IN LA SALVE. A WHOLE MONTH? PALALA? [speaks foreign language] YOU DIDN'T NEED ME. YOU NEEDED A CADDY. PALALA WILL CADDY YOUR BAGS TO THE BOAT. HUH, YOU SEND ME BACK ON THE BASIS OF MY GENDER. IT'S CALLED SEX DISCRIMINATION. LOOK, I UNDERSTAND YOUR RESERVATIONS. I HEARD ABOUT YOUR WIFE. MY WIFE? [scoffs] GOOD GOD. SHE LEFT ME. I WISH YOU'D FOLLOW HER EXAMPLE. ARE WE FINISHED? YOU HAVE A BOAT TO CATCH. NO BOAT! I WANT A MEAL AND A BATH! THIS ISN'T A HOTEL. I'LL LEAVE WHEN I'M DAMN WELL READY. I KNOW. AFTER A MEAL AND A BATH. I'M NOT A 19-YEAR-OLD GRAD STUDENT WORKING UP A RESUME, AND I DON'T EXPECT TO BE TREATED AS IF I WERE. I'M HUNGRY, I'M TIRED... AND I'VE BEEN IN THESE CLOTHES FOR MORE THAN ONE DANCE. PALALA WILL SEE THAT YOU GET SOME BREAKFAST. I SAID, "AND A BATH." UNBUTTON YOUR SHIRT. EXCUSE ME? YOU WANT TO BATHE IN THEIR WATER SUPPLY, YOU'LL TAKE A MEDICAL FIRST. SIT DOWN, HERE. [sighs] IS HE GONNA WATCH? DON'T YOU WANT A NURSE PRESENT? I'LL RISK IT. WELL, I WON'T. AH! DEEP BREATH. NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'VE BEEN SO SECRETIVE ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH HERE. AGAIN. YOU'VE FOUND THE CURE FOR THE COMMON HANGOVER. AH! LOOK UP. LEFT...RIGHT. [sighs] OPEN YOUR MOUTH. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME. SAY, "AHH." AHH! SEE YOUR CONNECTOR. MY WHAT? IT'S IN YOUR PASSPORT. YOUR VACCINE CARD. OH, GOD. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. THE PRINCIPLE CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG ABORIGINALS IS IMPORTED DISEASE. [electronic beeping] WHAT DO YOU SEE? I THOUGHT WE DID THE EYE EXAMINATION. COME ON. YOU WON TWO THURMAN AWARDS. SHOW OFF. WHAT AM I ANALYZING? DID YOU RUN A BASELINE? NO. NEXT TIME, RUN A BASELINE TO CALIBRATE THE MACHINE. THERE'S A GLUCOSE SOLUTION SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT. IS THAT THE SUBSTANCE YOU'RE ANALYZING? YES. [computer beeps] WHAT IS IT, A PLANT EXTRACT? AH, FULL MARKS. CONTINUE. OKAY. [computer beeps] WE'RE LOOKING AT, UH... 49 COMPOUNDS. [rain begins to fall, thunder rumbles] OKAY, WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS-- WHERE WAS I? OKAY, 49 COMPOUNDS. NO, NO, NOPE. NEARLY ALL OF THESE ARE IDENTIFIABLE. IN SHORT, NOTHING NEW. IS THIS WHY YOU WANTED THE CHROMATOGRAPH? YOU SAID, "NEARLY ALL IDENTIFIABLE." YEAH. JUST THIS ONE, UH, PEAK 37. LOOKS LIKE AN ACID DERIVATIVE. ALTHOUGH THOSE SIDE-- YOU MUST HAVE REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE ONTO SOMETHING. I'M SORRY. CAN IT BE SYNTHESIZED? UH-UH. THIS ONE'S MOTHER NATURE'S KITCHEN. END OF STORY. WHY? WHAT IS IT YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT? I DON'T THINK. I KNOW. SHARE IT. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? EVEN AS A CHILD, HE DIDN'T LIKE TO SHARE. IT'S DEEP-SEATED, I SUPPOSE. WHAT IS IT, A SECRET? I'LL CROSS MY HEART AND SPIT ON THE FLOOR. YOU SAID BREAKFAST AND A BATH, HUH? PALALA? [speaking foreign language] HEY, YOU SAVING IT FOR SEALOVE? DON'T. HE'S NOT COMING. THEN I'LL SETTLE FOR ROBINSON. YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GOT ME AND LAST YEAR'S CHROMATOGRAPH. I GIVE UP. I BELIEVE OUR DEAL WAS BATH, BREAKFAST, AND BOAT. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO MAKE DEALS! THEN WHY DID YOU COME HERE? I'LL LEAVE THE CHROMATOGRAPH FOR THE TIME BEING. I'M ASKING YOU A QUESTION. YOU HAVE NO IDEA, HAVE YOU? ASTON'S CONSIDERING PULLING YOUR FUNDS AND SHIPPING YOU OUT. I'M YOUR JUDGE AND JURY. WINSLOW WOULD NEVER PERMIT THAT. AH, WINSLOW! WINSLOW RETIRED LAST YEAR. IF YOU HADN'T CUT OFF INCOMING, YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT. WHO REPLACED HIM? ME. YOU DON'T GIVE PROGRESS REPORTS! YOU MOVE YOUR DAMN STATION WHEREVER AND WHENEVER YOU LIKE! YOU KNOW, WE NEED A RECORD OF EXPENSES! OH, AND YOU DON'T RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION! SO HERE I AM! SO HERE I AM! [indistinct yelling] PUT THIS ON. I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING. I'VE SEEN IT. PUT IT ON! PLEASE. FOLLOW ME. [speaking native language] THIS IS KALANA... WIFE OF JAHAUSA, MOTHER OF IMANA. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] PALPATE HER THROAT. I'M NOT A MEDIC. GOOD GOD, WOMAN. MUST EVERYTHING BE A FULL-SCALE DEBATE WITH YOU? JUST DO IT. FEEL ANYTHING? NOTHING. AH, SIX MONTHS AGO SHE CAME TO SEE ME. COUPLE OF LUMPS IN HER THROAT. I SENT HER DOWNRIVER WITH A FRANCISCAN MISSIONARY TO THE HOSPITAL THERE, AND SHE MADE HER OWN WAY BACK. TOOK HER A MONTH. AND THE NODES WERE ALMOST DOUBLE THE SIZE. DEPSWA. TWO INJECTIONS OF THAT SAMPLE YOU JUST TESTED, AND THE LUMPS DISAPPEARED WITHIN A WEEK. NO BOOSTERS. NO SIDE EFFECTS. THAT'S JUST SWELL. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO REPORT TO THE FOUNDATION? DR. CAMPBELL SHOWED ME A CURED PATIENT WHO CLAIMS A HISTORY OF UNDIAGNOSED, UNDOCUMENTED LUMPS IN HER THROAT? HEY! OW! LOOK, I'M TIRED-- HERE IT IS. A SCAN REPORT. SHE BROUGHT IT BACK FROM MANICOBE. THAT'S DELIGHTFUL. I'LL BRING IT WITH ME IF YOU'LL CONTACT DR. ORNEGA-- "STAGE TWO: ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR LYMPHOMAS." [grunts] HERE. CHECK HER BIOPSY REPORT. WHAT FOR? IT COULD BE ANYBODY'S. OKAY. YOU THINK I'M LYING? I THINK YOU'RE A MAN WHO'S ALLOWED HIS PERSONAL PROBLEMS GET IN THE WAY OF HIS CLINICAL JUDGMENT. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. STAY. STAY? STAY? HE TALKS TO ME LIKE A DOG. 500,000 SCIENTISTS IN THIS WORLD, AND I END UP WITH DR. MENGELE WITH A PONYTAIL. NOW WHAT?! GOOD GOD. FEEL THAT? WHAT IS IT? A SUPRACLAVICULAR NODE. MALIGNANT. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I GAVE IT TO HIM. TRANSPLANTED TISSUE. I GAVE IT TO THEM ALL. YOU WILL BIOPSY THE LOT. I INSIST. THAT IS YOUR CONTROL GROUP. AND THIS LUCKY BUGGER GETS AN INJECTION BY NIGHTFALL AND TOMORROW, IN THE MORNING, YOU WILL EXAMINE HIM. OH, COME ON! I'M NOT PROPOSING MARRIAGE. I'M ASKING YOU TO BIOPSY A FAMILY OF RODENTS. SPEND 12 HOURS IN A PERFECTLY LUXURIOUS HAMMOCK. NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT. JUST NOD. [guinea pigs squeal] [children speaking native language] WHERE'S THE BALL? [speaking native language] NO BALL. [speaking native language] HERE. THERE. HOLD IT. THERE. [speaking native language] WHAT WAS IN THE TIN? HMM? THE BOYS, YOU WERE GIVING THEM SOMETHING FROM THE TIN. AH, CANDY-COATED ANTS. OH. YOU WANT SOME? THE TIN IS INSIDE ON THE TABLE. I'LL PASS. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT IS IT? FREEZE-DRIED ICE CREAM. I'LL PASS. COME ON. THE ASTRONAUTS EAT IT. DOESN'T TASTE LIKE ICE CREAM. [scoffs] WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU HAD A DOUBLE DIP? THE PALATE REMEMBERS. THAT WOMAN, KALANA? SHE CALLED YOU SOMETHING. "DEPSWA." "DEPSWA"? WHAT'S IT MEAN? "MEDICINE MAN." THAT'S ME. DON'T THEY HAVE ONE OF THEIR OWN? WHAT? MEDICINE MAN. I GAVE ALKA-SELTZER TO A KID WITH A BELLY ACHE. YOU DID WHAT? ALKA-SELTZER CURED HIM WITH ONE BELCH. BUT IT WAS THE, "PLOP, PLOP, FIZZ, FIZZ," THAT REALLY DAZZLED THEM. THE MEDICINE MAN WAS UNDERSTANDABLY PISSED OFF. I HAD TAKEN HIS STICK. STICK? HIS SELF-RESPECT. HIS PLACE. SO HE JUST TOOK OFF. MY INTENTIONS WERE WELL MEANT, BUT... YOU TAKE THE HAMMOCK. I'LL SLEEP IN THE GREENHOUSE. WELL, IF I NEED ANYTHING, I'LL LET YOU KNOW. YOU WILL? GOOD. THANK YOU. DR. CAMPBELL? ALREADY? MY NAME IS DR. CRANE. RAE CRANE. JUST IN CASE YOU NEED TO, UH, ADDRESS ME DIRECTLY. I THOUGHT I'D JUST CALL YOU "BROOKLYN." I'M FROM THE BRONX. OH, WELL, THE BRONX. DOESN'T QUITE ROLL OFF THE TONGUE, DOES IT? GOOD NIGHT. [speaking native language] [humming] WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? I'M COVERING MY ASS. AH! I DON'T WANT YOU ACCUSING ME OF PLAYING SWITCHEROO WITH YOUR CONTROL GROUP. OH, I GET IT. PEACH PALM FESTIVAL, DAY TWO. NO. NO FESTIVAL. JUST A BEDTIME STORY. YOU'RE STARING AT ME. YOUR PAJAMAS. I HAVEN'T SEEN PAJAMAS IN... A LONG TIME. [screaming] OH, JESUS! OH! WHOA! WHAT IS IT NOW? [whining] GOD. AH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S HENRY. HE KEEPS THE PLACE FREE OF RATS. COME ON, OLD DEAR. COME ON. LOOK, I'LL SLEEP WITH LIZARDS, AND I'LL SLEEP WITH GUINEA PIGS-- OH, I UNDERSTAND. A GIRL HAS TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE. COME ON, OLD DEAR. SWEET DREAMS. GO TO HELL. PROBABLY. NO, DO YOU? WHY DO YOU THINK THAT? [laughter] THAT'S VERY FUNNY. DR. CAMPBELL! DR. CAMPBELL! DR. CAMPBELL! [laughter] IMANA. GOOD STUFF, BOTH OF YOU. CAMPBELL! JESUS, CAMPBELL. I KNOW. YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW. YOU'VE FOUND THE CURE FOR CANCER AND ALL YOU CAN SAY IS, "I KNOW"? WHAT IS IT? BROMELIAD. THE FLOWER. HOW'D YOU FIND IT? GET DRESSED. OKAY. I CAME HERE SIX YEARS AGO. WHY? A FREAK TRIBE. NO CANCER. WHAT ABOUT THE WOMAN YOU SHOWED ME? NO, JAHAUSA MARRIED OUTSIDE THE TRIBE. KALANA'S AN EXOTI. THEN IT'S GENETIC. NO, NO, NO. IT'S ENVIRONMENTAL. THE TRIBES HAVE ALWAYS INTERMARRIED. BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THE BROMELIAD DOESN'T GROW ANYWHERE EXCEPT HERE. SO THE EXOTI DON'T USE IT. KALANA STILL DOESN'T PUT IT IN THEIR FOOD. SHE SAYS IT TASTES BAD. SO THEY EAT THIS FLOWER? INGEST IT. SNUFF AND, UH, SOMETIMES CHEWING TOBACCO. WELL, IT'S IN MOST OF THEIR FOOD. GROWS WILD, A HUNDRED FEET UP IN THE CANOPY. TEN STORIES UP? MMM, ON THE TOP SHELF OF THE PHARMACOLOGICAL SUPERSTORE. LIVES OFF A TREE. I'D SEEN THE OLD MEDICINE MAN UP THERE GATHERING FOR HIS JUJU KIT. AND THERE IT WAS. THERE'S ONLY ONE FLY IN THE SERUM. I CAN'T REPRODUCE IT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? NONE OF THE NEW SAMPLES WORK. AND I HAVE VERY LITTLE OF THE ORIGINAL SERUM LEFT. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY I CAN'T REPRODUCE IT. WAIT A MINUTE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?! I FOUND A CURE FOR THE FUCKIN' PLAGUE OF THE 20th CENTURY, AND NOW I'VE LOST IT! HAVEN'T YOU EVER LOST ANYTHING, DR. BRONX? YOUR PURSE, YOUR CAR KEYS? WELL, IT'S RATHER LIKE THAT. NOW YOU HAVE IT. NOW YOU DON'T. YOUR NOTES ARE GONE? I HAVE MY NOTES. I FOLLOWED MY NOTES. YOUR NOTES MUST BE WRONG. THEY'RE NOT. THEN EXPLAIN IT. I--I CAN'T. OKAY. THE FIRST THING I DO WHEN I GET TO L.A. IS I GET DR. CROWSON. HIS PEOPLE CAN SET UP A REAL LAB DOWN HERE. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS LAB. WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED. LOOK... THIS IS MAJOR LEAGUE. YOU NEED HELP. I PROMISE YOU WILL GET FULL CREDIT. DO YOU THINK I GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE IMMORTAL TEXTBOOK QUOTE? DARE I INSULT YOU WITH A HISTORY LESSON? NO, BETTER STILL, HOW ABOUT SUBTRACTION? 9 MILLION INDIANS IN THE AMAZON. WHITE MEN BRING MEASLES, FLU, POLIO, AND CHICKEN POX. NOW YOU'VE GOT 200,000 INDIANS. WITHOUT USING YOUR FINGERS, JUST HOW MANY DID WE SHOVE IN THE HOLE? IT'S NOT THEY'LL BE UNVACCINATED. THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE WORKING FOR ASTON. ALL PRECAUTIONS WOULD BE TAKEN. YOU DON'T REMEMBER MOCARA, DO YOU? YOU'RE TOO YOUNG. SOME OVEREAGER SON OF A BITCH FOUND A GREAT LITTLE PAINKILLER IN THE JUNGLE. $0.15 TO MAKE A $5 BOTTLE. ASTON WAS ONTO IT LIKE A FLY TO DUNG. ALL VERY SCIENTIFIC. ALL PRECAUTIONS TAKEN. SWINE FLU KILLED THE ENTIRE VILLAGE. MUCH REGRET. SO SORRY. BUT THE EAGER BEAVER STILL ENDED UP WITH HIS $0.10 ON THE DOLLAR. THIS ISN'T A PAINKILLER. THIS IS THE CURE FOR CANCER. THESE PEOPLE DON'T NEED A CURE FOR CANCER. ASK THEM. THERE'S A ROAD COMING INTO THE AREA. YOU'RE FINISHED. ASTON CAN STOP THAT. ASTON WILL NEED THE ROAD. THEY'LL MAKE SURE THAT IT LEADS RIGHT UP TO MY PALAPA. HOW CAN I GO-- HOW CAN YOU GO BACK WHEN I NEED YOU HERE? WHAT? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M A DAMN GOOD BIOCHEMIST. I'M NOT A FIELD RESEARCHER. I HAVEN'T DONE THIS WORK FOR YEARS. I'M NOT QUALIFIED. I KNOW. TOO MANY FOUNDATION FUNDRAISERS. TOO MANY SUBCOMMITTEES. TAKE TWO GUINEA PIGS AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING. WELL, WHEN YOU'RE OLD AND GRAY, YOU'LL PUT LILIES ON MY GRAVE AND WISH YOU COULD THANK ME. YEAH, WELL, I'LL THANK YOU NOW, BUT I'M STILL LEAVING. [chuckles] HOW? CAMPBELL... I'M NOT YOUR PRISONER. NO, YOU'RE MY RESEARCH ASSISTANT. YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF HEIGHTS, ARE YOU, BRONX? RIGHT FOOT. AND UP. [grunts] THERE YOU ARE. YOU GIVE THE CUTAWAY A GOOD YANK... AND UP YOU GO. EH? WELL, COME ON. I WANT YOU TO SEE. WHOO! OH! COME ON. OOH. OH. ALL RIGHT. DR. BRONX. LEFT LEG FIRST. THERE. NOW THE RIGHT. [grunts] THERE YOU ARE. THIS UP HERE. OH! ALL RIGHT? COME ON. OH, GOD. THINK OF NEIL ARMSTRONG. ALL RIGHT. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE WEEK. DID YOU HEAR ME? THEY'RE NOT IN ABUNDANCE. IF YOU FIND ONE, PLOP IT IN THE BAG. OH! ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE? YES. LIKE THIS. WHATEVER THIS FLOWER NEEDS TO FERTILIZE, IT GETS IT UP HERE. WHETHER IT'S A AN AIR STREAM BEING TRANSFERRED BY AN INSECT FOR THE POLLEN, OR GOD KNOWS WHAT LEAKING OUT OF THE TREE-- COULD BE ANYTHING. IT COULD BE EVERYTHING. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THIS SYSTEM. YOU CAN'T BEAT IT. YOU CAN ONLY WIPE IT OUT. IS THAT THE ROAD? YOU SEE THE RIVER? NO ONE CAN REMEMBER IT EVER BEING THIS LOW. WHAT ABOUT ALL THE RAIN? EVERY YEAR IT RAINS LESS. LESS RAINFOREST MEANS LESS RAIN. THE INDIANS HAVE ASKED ME TO PRAY FOR A DELUGE. DO YOU PRAY, BRONX? THERE'S SO MUCH SMOKE. I DIDN'T KNOW THE ROAD WAS SO CLOSE. YES, WELL, DEATH IS INEVITABLE, DR. BRONX. BUT IT'S CONSIDERED BAD FORM TO DISCUSS IT OVER A MAN'S SICK-BED, ALL RIGHT? YEAH, WELL, CLOSING YOUR EYES WON'T MAKE IT DISAPPEAR. NEITHER WILL TALK. LET'S GO. YOU'RE A LUNATIC. I'LL SHOW YOU A SHORTCUT! WOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO! WHOO-HA-HA-HA! OH, GOD, OH, GOD. WHEN WAS IT MADE? WHAT? THE EIGHTH SAMPLE, WHEN WAS IT MADE? UH, DATA SHEETS. GREEN NOTEBOOK, TOP LEFT. YOU DON'T SMOKE, DO YOU? NO, I QUIT. GOOD GOD. WHY? THEY'VE BEEN MISSING FROM THE LAST THREE SHIPMENTS. I SUSPECT JAHAUSA'S GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. YOUR OTHER LEFT. LAST ONE. HMM. OKAY, LOOK. HERE'S THE ORIGINAL EXTRACT, THE ONE THAT WORKS. HERE'S THE EIGHT SUBSEQUENT ONES THAT DON'T WORK. YOU NOTICE ANYTHING? I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT. IT'S MISSING FROM EVERY FAILED SAMPLE. PEAK 37. DID YOU VARY THE SOLUTION? NO. YOU THINK THE BROMELIAD CHANGES CHEMISTRY DURING ITS LIFE CYCLE? IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE. BUT ALL THESE SAMPLES ARE DATED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF EACH OTHER. MAYBE THE FIRST BATCH WAS CONTAMINATED. MAYBE PEAK 37 IS A FUNGUS. NO, I SCREENED EVERY SAMPLE, INCLUDING THE FIRST ONE. YEAH, WELL, MAYBE YOU USED A DIRTY TEST TUBE. WHO KNOWS? THERE'S GOTTA BE A THOUSAND VARIATIONS ON THIS PLANT EXTRACT AND WE'VE GOTTA MAKE AND TEST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. I TELL YOU, WE NEED HELP. WE'RE LOOKING AT TOO MANY POSSIBILITIES. ISN'T THAT WHAT SCIENCE IS ALL ABOUT? ELIMINATING POSSIBILITIES? [speaking native language indistinctly] WELL? YOU SAID YOU NEEDED HELP. OKAY, JAHAUSA, CAN YOU TELL THEM THAT I NEED THEM TO BREAK IT FROM THE ROOT? KEEP THAT ROOT. [speaking native language] HOW WE DOING? TELL HER IF SHE BREAKS THE LEAVES, IT'S EASIER. IF SHE BREAKS THEM-- SEE, THEY'RE TOO BIG. IMANA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY WAY? HOW YOU DOING? GOOD. THIS IS EXCELLENT. [speaking native language] [laughs] HI, ARE YOU BREAKING THEM FROM THE ROOTS? YOU GOTTA BREAK 'EM FROM THE ROOTS, OKAY? UH, IT'S KALANA. HI. OKAY. [speaking native language] I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'M SORRY. DEPSWA! [speaking native language] [replies in foreign language] [laughter] IT'S ALL RIGHT. HE JUST WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE A DATE FOR THE PROM, EUPHEMISTICALLY SPEAKING. WHY ARE THEY STARING AT ME? THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A VIRGIN OF YOUR MATURITY. WHAT? I HAD TO GIVE THEM SOME EXCUSE. WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID, "SHE'S ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED." REALLY? OH, IT'S TO BE MRS. BRONX? IT WILL BE NEXT WINTER. I DON'T APPROVE OF LONG ENGAGEMENTS. WE WOULDA LIKED TO HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED EARLIER, BUT IT WASN'T CONVENIENT. AH, A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE. YOU PROBABLY KNOW HIM, OR AT LEAST HIS FAMILY. TOM FALLON? TOMMY FALLON? GOOD GOD, HE'S ABOUT 95 YEARS OLD. YOU'LL INHERIT BEFORE THE HONEYMOON'S OVER. I TAKE MY HAT OFF TO YOU, GIRL. HIS SON. OH, HIS SON? NO, I DON'T KNOW THE SON, BUT I CAN WELL IMAGINE. GOOD STOCK. GOOD CONTRIBUTOR. MET AT A FUNDRAISER, DID WE? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WHERE I MET HIM? DON'T GET YOUR KNICKERS IN A TWIST, MRS. BRONX. JUST REMEMBER, BREEDING IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR INTELLIGENCE. OFTEN THE DEATH OF IT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE, AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF THAT STUFF? THE SALIVA SPEEDS UP THE FERMENTATION PROCESS. PASS. WELL, YOU MIGHT AS WELL. YOU CAN'T TEST THIS LOT FOR ANOTHER 72 HOURS. IT'LL GO BY JUST AS FAST IF WE'RE TESTING THE LOCAL FUNGUS. I TOLD YOU I SCREENED EVERY SAMPLE. WELL, THERE IS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY. WHICH IS? A SIX-PACK OF PEACH "PEAR-NOD," AND YOU WERE DRUNKER THAN A SKUNK WHEN YOU DID THE TEST. PERNOD. THE "D" IS SILENT. IF YOU'RE GONNA HANG AROUND WITH THE FALLONS, YOU BETTER GET IT RIGHT, KID. PERNOD. MM-HMM. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. SHALL I WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU? WHAT IF THE MISSING STEP ISN'T HERE IN THE LAB? YOUR MEDICINE MAN, THE FIRST DAY YOU SAW HIM COLLECT THE BROMELIADS, WHAT IF HE DID SOMETHING? I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING YOU INSTINCTIVELY COPIED THAT FIRST TIME AND HAVEN'T DONE SINCE. WHAT IF IT'S IN THE HARVESTING? I COUNTED AT LEAST THREE WHAT-IFS. YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T START AN INVESTIGATION WITH, "ONCE UPON A TIME," DO YOU? EXACTLY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO INVESTIGATE? NOT WHAT, WHO. YOUR MERRY MEN MUST KNOW WHERE THE MEDICINE MAN IS. WE SHOULD GO AND QUESTION HIM. AS YOU YOURSELF POINTED OUT, YOU'RE SCARCELY A QUALIFIED FIELD RESEARCHER. AND AS YOU'VE POINTED OUT, RESEARCH IS A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION. DON'T YOU PRESUME TO TELL ME HOW TO FOLLOW UP. "QUESTION THE MEDICINE MAN." GOOD GOD. DON'T YOU THINK I QUESTIONED THE SON OF A BITCH? [children chattering] OCUPADO. OCUPADO! UH, UH, [speaks foreign language] UH, SOMEWHERE ELSE! RELAX. RELAX. THEY KNOW NOT TO URINATE IN THE WATER. THAT'S NOT MY CONCERN. WELL, IT SHOULD BE. URINE ATTRACTS THE SPIKY CANDIRU. IT'S A RELATIVELY TINY FISH THAT ENTERS ANY AVAILABLE ORIFICE. LOOK, CAN'T YOU BLOW A WHISTLE? MAYBE THEY'D LIKE TO FETCH SOME GOLF BALLS? THE SPIKES ARE ANGLED BACKWARDS AND HAVE TO BE SURGICALLY REMOVED. IT'S A HELL OF A PROCEDURE. I CAME TO APOLOGIZE. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I LOST MY TEMPER. ABOUT THE SPIKES? NO, ABOUT THE MEDICINE MAN. GOD DAMN IT, CAMPBELL. THE SPIKY CANDIRU. GOOD GOD, WHERE? HEY! [speaking foreign language] MUST ADMIT I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN ONE THIS FAR UPRIVER, BUT IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA TO KEEP YOUR KNICKERS ON. OH! WELL, ALL GONE. SATISFIED? I DIDN'T MEAN TO JUMP DOWN YOUR THROAT THIS AFTERNOON. WELL, THEN I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY. LET'S FORGET IT. THE, UH--THE MEDICINE MAN, HE WOULDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS UNTIL I GOT UP TO LEAVE, AND THEN HE SPOKE ONE WORD. MOCARA. THE SWINE FLU EPIDEMIC? YOU TOLD ME. AH, YEAH. WELL, THEY, UH-- HE WAS AFRAID, YOU SEE, BECAUSE IN MOCARA, THEIR MEDICINE MAN HAD SHARED FORBIDDEN JUJU MAGIC WITH THE EAGER BEAVER... AND SWINE FLU WAS THE GODS' PUNISHMENT FOR THAT INDISCRETION. ALL RIGHT. HE WOULDN'T TALK. HE MIGHT TALK TO ME. A WOMAN? LOOK, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO? SIT ON YOUR HANDS FOR THREE DAYS AND PRAY FOR PEAK 37? WE COULD TAKE JAHAUSA. HE COULD PLEAD OUR CASE. YOU COULD SAY YOU'RE SORRY. I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS IT WAS ME. I MEANT SORRY FOR THE ALKA-SELTZER. THOUGHT YOU MEANT MOCARA. AAH! DEPSWA. [speaking native language] IMANA. [speaking native language] IMANA. [speaking native language] IMANA. [speaking native language] SAME STORY AS THE MOTHER. SUPRACLAVICULAR NODE, NON-TENDER... AND ADHERING TO THE SURROUNDING TISSUES. HOW BIG WOULD YOU SAY? ONE CENTIMETER. THEN GIVE IT TWO. YOU CAN'T AND YOU KNOW IT. IT'S SO CLOSE TO HIS WINDPIPE HE'LL CHOKE TO DEATH BEFORE THE CANCER KILLS HIM. IT'S NOT A WEED. IT'S A TUMOR. IT CAN WAIT. IT'S NOT A TUMOR. IT'S A CHILD. THE CHILD CAN WAIT TOO. YOU USE UP THE LAST BIT OF THE WORKING SERUM, AND WE HAVE NOTHING. YOU CAN'T USE THE LAST OF IT. WE KNOW THE MOLECULE. A PICTURE! A GHOST IN THE MACHINE! FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, CAMPBELL, USE YOUR HEAD! THE BOY WON'T DIE IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS. LOOK, ONE OF THOSE BEAKERS SPROUT PEAK 37, YOU CAN GIVE SAMPLES AWAY FOR CHRISTMAS. I'LL HELP YOU WRAP. SUPPOSE THE NEW SERUMS DON'T WORK? YOU SAID YOURSELF YOU FOUND THE CURE FOR THE PLAGUE OF THIS CENTURY. IT BELONGS TO THE HUMAN RACE, NOT TO ONE SICK KID. DEPSWA? COME ON, GIMME THAT SYRINGE. IT'LL BE MY SLEEPLESS NIGHT. [speaking foreign language indistinctly] JAHAUSA'S TAKING HIS SON TO THE MEDICINE MAN. WHEN SHE WOKE UP THIS MORNING, THEY WERE BOTH GONE. SHE WANTS ME TO BRING THEM BACK. MEDICINE MAN? KALANA, WHERE'S THE MEDICINE MAN? [speaking native language] WHAT IS SHE SAYING? SAYING JAHAUSA'S A FOOL-- WHO CAN SHOW US WHERE THE MEDICINE MAN IS? PALALA. PALALA? PALALA CAN SHOW US. CAN'T HEAR YOU! LOOK, GET OUT OF THERE! IF WE LEAVE NOW, WE CAN CATCH UP TO JAHAUSA! CAN'T HEAR YOU! YOU GOT SOME HISTORY-- FINE, IT'S HISTORY. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? DRAG IT AROUND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? IF THAT MAN HAS ANSWERS, WE NEED THEM! I CAN'T HEAR-- CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW? [gasps] WHAT IS IT? HEADACHE. KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE GROUND, YOU WON'T CHANGE FOCUS, YOU WON'T GET A HEADACHE. YOU MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED IT EARLIER. OH, DIDN'T I? I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT I DID. PALALA? [speaking foreign language] OH, NO. I GOT SOMETHING BETTER. GIVE IT. NO, NO. [sighs] WHAT IS IT? YOKO TREE. THE BARK IS 3% PURE CAFFEINE. CURES HEADACHES, FATIGUE, ACHES, PAINS, NEURITIS, NEURALGIA. DRINK IT. IT'LL KEEP YOU ON YOUR FEET TILL DINNERTIME. PASS. DRINK IT. PASS. DRINK IT... OR PALALA WILL FORCE YOU ON YOUR BACK, CLOSE YOUR NOSE, WHILE I POUR IT DOWN YOUR GULLET. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, PALALA? [chuckles] UH-HUH, "GULLET." GO AHEAD. [gags] WHOA! WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS BARK? IT'S CALLED YOKO. YOKO. YOU KNOW, THIS WOULD KNOCK MAXWELL HOUSE RIGHT OFF THE SHELF... IF THE NARCS WOULDN'T STOP ME AT THE BORDER. [gasps] OOH. THIS ISN'T A HALLUCINOGEN IS IT? WHICH PEAK IS HIS? NONE OF THE ABOVE. THE OLD MAN LIVES AT THE BASE OF THE GORGE. DOWNHILL. YEAH. HUH! HEY, WE'VE GOTTA TALK ABOUT MARKETING THIS STUFF. * YOKO COLA * COLA * YOKO COLA HEY, OF COURSE YOU'D HAVE TO ADD SUGAR! YOUR VERSION TASTES LIKE SHH-- OH, MAN! THEY DON'T SPIT IN THIS ONE, DO THEY? UH, SPIT? NO, BUT-- OKAY, DON'T TELL ME. REALLY, DON'T TELL ME. WHEW! * YOCAFF * YOSPRESSO * YOCAFF YOSPRESSO HEY, HAVE YOU BROKEN IT DOWN YET? WHOA, LOOK AT THAT! IF I WERE THE MEDICINE MAN, I WOULDA TAKEN THAT PENTHOUSE. WHY DOES HE LIVE AT THE BOTTOM? TO GET AWAY FROM THE CONSTANT GABBING, MOST LIKELY. OH, SORRY FOR DISTURBING YOU. WHOA! [giggles] YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M OKAY. [laughing] GO AHEAD. I'LL CATCH UP. [chuckles] THAT "YOCOLA" SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE A KID'S DRINK. I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE MASS MARKETING-- OKAY. I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE MASS MARKETING OF THIS DRINK FOR THE ADULT, LIKE A CONTINENTAL, SUAVE THING. UM, IS IT DIFFICULT... TO PROCESS THAT YOKO BARK? [grunts] WHOA! [screaming] BRONX? WHERE ARE YOU? I'M ALL RIGHT. DON'T PLAY SILLY BUGGERS. WHERE ARE YOU? I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M OKAY. STAY WHERE YOU ARE. [screaming] I'M GONNA LOWER A HARNESS. PALALA?

WE MIGHT BE IN THE WRONG GORGE. OH, SOMEHOW I DOUBT THAT. I MEAN, ARE YOU SURE PALALA KNOWS WHERE HE LIVES? OH, YEAH. WHAT IF HE DOESN'T? WHAT DO WE DO THEN? [moans] I THOUGHT I WAS DREAMING. CAMPBELL, I THOUGHT-- [speaking native language] OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON? IT SEEMS THERE'S GOING TO BE A FIGHT. BETWEEN YOU AND HIM? MM-HMM. HE'S THREE FEET TALL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. YOU WANTED TO PICK HIS BRAINS. NOT OFF THE SIDEWALK. EVER MOUTH OFF TO THE DEAN, AND THEN NEED A GRANT? OH. THIS IS A EAT-CROW, KISS-ASS CONTEST? EXACTLY. REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT TAKING HIS STICK? I THINK THIS IS ABOUT GIVING IT BACK. SO HE'S GOTTA WIN? MM-HMM. OKAY. BEND OVER, TAKE THREE WHACKS, AND LET'S CUT TO THE INFO. IT DOESN'T QUITE WORK THAT WAY. [speaking native language] THE TRICKY PART IS-- IS WHAT? NOT GETTING MY SKULL CRACKED IN THE PROCESS. [speaking native language] [responds in foreign language] [speaking native language] TELL HIM HIS MOTHER EATS ARMY BOOTS. [speaking native language] [responds in foreign language] HE'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COUSINS MARRY! FOR CHRIST'S SAKE-- AH! [speaking native language] I WAS HELPING. WELL, DON'T! [speaking native language] I DON'T NEED A BLOODY INTERPRETER. I DO. [grunts] DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK, RUNT. CAMPBELL. [speaking foreign language] OH, YEAH. NICE KISS. [speaking foreign language] [speaking foreign language] [speaking native language] [responds in foreign language] [speaking native language] WHAT? WHAT'D HE SAY? WHAT'D HE SAY? AH! WHAT'D HE SAY? WHAT'D HE SAY? BACK TO SQUARE ONE. WHERE DID I GO WRONG? THE EATING CROW OR THE KISSING ASS DEPARTMENT? HMM? IT WASN'T A TOTAL LOSS. [speaking native language] [speaking native language] MY, MY. ISN'T IT ALL BRIGHT AND SHINY? I CLEANED UP A LITTLE, THAT'S ALL. THESE FIRST FOUR EXTRACTS WILL BE READY TO TEST BY 7:00. I'LL SET MY ALARM CLOCK FOR 6:30. INCIDENTALLY, THE BLUE DOESN'T COME OFF. GET DRUNK SOMEWHERE ELSE. HEY, I LIVE HERE. GET SANCTIMONIOUS SOMEWHERE ELSE. I TRIED TO GET DRUNK AT JAHAUSA'S, AS A MATTER OF FACT. BUT I SOON TIRED OF HEARING HIM PRAY OVER HIS ONLY SON. SO I SAID TO MYSELF, "WHY NOT VISIT DR. BRONX AND HER TABERNACLE OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE?" I'M NOT A MONSTER, CAMPBELL. NO, YOU'RE NOT A MONSTER. AND IF I HAVE IN ANY WAY LABELED YOU MONSTROUS BY GESTURE OR MANNER, I SINCERELY BEG YOUR PARDON. I'D LIKE TO GO TO SLEEP NOW. I HAVE AN EARLY MORNING. I WOULDN'T BOTHER SETTING THAT ALARM, MONSTER BRONX. HE WON'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. HEY, I PICTURE YOU AT IMANA'S AGE... SITTING IN BED, AWAKE, ARMS CROSSED, WHISPERING, "I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS. I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS." WHERE WAS I WHEN YOU WERE SIX YEARS OF AGE AND ARMED AGAINST THE DARK? PROBABLY HIDING, LIKE YOU ARE NOW. IN THE JUNGLE OR IN THE BOTTLE? TO WHICH HIDEOUT ARE YOU REFERRING? DOES IT MATTER? IT'S NOT AS DIFFICULT AS YOU MIGHT THINK WATCHING SOMEONE DIE. AFTER 70 OR 80 MEN, WOMEN, INFANTS... YOU BEGIN TO FEEL QUITE NUMB. WHEN I LEFT JAHAUSA'S HUT, I WAS COMING HERE TO GET THE MAGIC SERUM. TO SAVE MYSELF, OF COURSE. NOT THE BOY. WHICH MAKES ME THE MONSTER. YOU, AT LEAST, WOULD SAVE THE WORLD. AND THE WORLD IS NOT ONE CHOKING BOY IN THE MIDDLE OF A DISAPPEARING FOREST. EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS THAT WAY HERE IN THE DARK, AGAINST WHICH YOU ARE SO WELL ARMED... AND I HAVE ONLY THIS. ENOUGH. GIMME THAT BOTTLE. YOU'RE NOT A MURDERER. THAT'S NOT WHY SHE LEFT YOU. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT? SHE LEFT ME... BECAUSE I WOULDN'T ALLOW HER TO FORGIVE ME. SHE VERY MUCH WANTED TO DO SO. BUT I COULDN'T FORGIVE MYSELF. UNTIL I DO, NO ONE-- NO ONE'S ALLOWED. DEPSWA. [speaking native language] OH. WE'VE BEEN INVITED TO A PRAYER MEETING. I'LL MAKE YOUR EXCUSES. [chanting in native language] [rhythmic chanting in native language] [indistinct chatter] OH, HI. KALANA! KALANA! KALANA! [speaking native language] YES, YES, HE'S OKAY. HE'S OKAY. HE'LL BE FINE. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY IS EVERYONE RUNNING? [indistinct yelling] TIME'S UP. [indistinct chatter] A MIRACLE WITHOUT PROOF IS ONLY A MIRACLE. IT DO NOT STOP BULLDOZERS. LOOK, ORNEGA, I INJECTED HIM MYSELF. I'M NOT DOUBTING IT. THIS BROMELIAD, I'VE NEVER SEEN IT GROWING ANYWHERE ELSE. YOU CAN'T TRANSPLANT IT TO THE LAB. CHRIST, I COULDN'T BRING IT DOWN 100 FEET FROM ORIGIN. NOW YOU MOVE YOUR ROAD THROUGH HERE, AND WE'VE LOST IT. COME ON, ROBERTO. IT'S NOT MY ROAD. WE NEED TIME. WE'RE TESTING NEW SAMPLES. SENOR REYES, HE HAS ALREADY BEEN INSTRUCTED TO MOVE THE VILLAGERS. IF A TEST IS SUCCESSFUL IN, SAY, NEXT 24 HOURS-- [whispers] 24 HOURS? THE BULLDOZERS ARE RUNNING NIGHT AND DAY NOW. I'M GONNA RETEST. IT DIDN'T WORK, RAE. IT'S NOT HERE. BUT YOU PROMISED ME A WEEK. YOU GAVE ME A WEEK. PACK YOUR BAGS, RAE, BEFORE THE ROAD GETS HERE. [chuckles] YOU'RE ALWAYS THROWING ME OUT. IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT? QUITE A BIT. YOU DON'T SMOKE, DO YOU? THERE'S GOTTA BE A CIGARETTE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ME? SUPPOSED TO BE? I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD LIKENESS. TAKE IT IF YOU WANT. NO, I'D RATHER YOU KEPT IT. WELL, I CERTAINLY FLATTERED YOU A BIT BY IDEALIZING YOUR FOREHEAD, BUT A MAN IN LOVE WOULDN'T NOTICE THE DISPARITY. A MAN IN LOVE? YEAH, TOMMY FALLON, THE YOUNGER. GIVE IT TO HIM. I'M SURE HE SEES YOUR FOREHEAD EXACTLY AS I'VE DRAWN IT. AND HE PROBABLY NEVER NOTICED THAT YOUR LEFT EAR IS LOWER THAN YOUR RIGHT EAR. WHEN ONE IS SMITTEN, THOSE ARE THE DETAILS-- WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING? BASELINE. WHAT ARE YOU USING? SUGAR SOLUTION. THE SAME SOLUTION YOU'VE USED EACH TIME? NO. I RAN OUT. WHY? WHERE'D YOU GET THE SUGAR? WHOA! CAMPBELL! CAMPBELL! [indistinct dialog] CAMPBELL! CAMPBELL! CAMPBELL! CAMPBELL! CAMPBELL! IT'S A DAMN POOR TIME FOR HAVING AN IRONMAN CONTEST. OW. HAVE YOU EVER LOST ANYTHING, ORNEGA? YOUR CAR KEYS, YOUR WALLET? IT WASN'T THE BROMELIADS. IT WAS THE ANTS. YOU'RE CERTAIN? I SEEM TO HAVE LEFT THE EVIDENCE IN MY OTHER SUIT. CAMPBELL? ROBERTO. ROBERTO? IT'S ME, MIGUEL. AH, MIGUEL. WE CAN GO WHENEVER YOU ARE READY. NO, NO, NO. I KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR NOW. IF THOSE LITTLE ORANGE BASTARDS EXIST SOMEWHERE ELSE... ROBERTO... I'LL FIND THEM. LOOK AT YOURSELF. IT'S TIME OUT, MY FRIEND. SIX YEARS AND ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT. ASTON ISN'T GOING-- ASTON WILL REPLACE IT, ALL OF IT. AND PROVIDE WITH A RESEARCH ASSISTANT, PER HIS REQUEST. DR. SEALOVE, IF I REMEMBER, WAS YOUR FIRST CHOICE. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. IF YOU ARE READY, WE SHOULD GO. GOOD LUCK. THANKS. GOOD LUCK TO YOU. YOU'LL BE IN TOUCH. [indistinct chatter] THEY WON'T RELOCATE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT HAS INDICATED. SOONER OR LATER, THEY'LL HAVE NO PLACE LEFT, THEN THEY'LL GO WHERE THEY'RE TOLD. HE SAYS THE MEDICINE MAN HAS FOUND A PLACE UPRIVER. MEDICINE MAN? YOU MEAN CAMPBELL? NO, THAT SMALL ONE OVER BY THE TREES. GIMME A MINUTE. RIGHT. I'LL TELL HIM. HE SAID THIS WAS YOUR STICK. HE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW. HE'S FOUND A GOOD PLACE. AND IF YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF, YOU CAN GO WITH THEM. HE SAID HE'LL TEACH YOU BIG MAGIC. HE SAID HE'S NEVER MET A MAN LIKE YOU BEFORE... AND MAYBE HE NEVER WILL AGAIN. I'M GONNA NEED IN ADDITION TO A NEW CHROMATOGRAPH, MORE SCOPES, CALIPERS-- I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERYTHING YOU NEED. WHEN I REACH THE CITY, I'LL CONTACT DR. SEALOVE. WELL, I'VE RECONSIDERED. UH, DR. SEALOVE IS MY SECOND CHOICE NOW. OH, COME ON, BRONX. YOU THINK TOM FALLON'S GONNA WALK DOWN THE AISLE WITH A WOMAN WHO HAS SOMETHING BLUE AS A TATTOO ON HER FOREHEAD, HUH? I WANT JOINT PUBLICATION. YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER YOU WANT. WHAT DO YOU WANT? A MEAL AND A BATH. THEN UNBUTTON YOUR SHIRT. [speaking native language] "DEAREST TOM, WE'RE PUSHING UPRIVER "IN SEARCH OF THOSE ANTS. "AND WITH SOME LUCK, WE'LL GET TO THEM "BEFORE THE LUMBER COMPANIES DO. "AND ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE? [chuckles] "WELL... I'M NOT SO SURE I'M READY FOR IT YET." [speaking native language] OKAY. [speaking foreign language] "HMM, LIFE IS STRANGE. BUT DOWN HERE..." HEY, BRONX! "IT SEEMS..." YEAH? "SO VERY PRECIOUS." COME ON! I'M COMING! [uplifting orchestral music] * [suspenseful music] *
