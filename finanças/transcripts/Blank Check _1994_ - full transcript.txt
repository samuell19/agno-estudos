Where are you? Oh. Hello, beautiful. Did you miss me? Dad, I-I've given this some thought, and I've decided that since Damien and Ralph have their own rooms, well, there's no reason why they should be bringin' their junk into my room. Well, how's that sound, Allen? - Out of the way, stick boy. - Hand & Foot is here to stay. - Oops. Kicked your baby monkey. - Get out of here, Ralph. - Here, take this. - Go away, Damien. This is my room. Was. Now it's also the world headquarters of Hand & Foot, Incorporated. Hand & Foot, all the way. Hand & Foot, Hand & Foot, Hand & Foot. Hand & Foot? You guys aren't gonna make a dime. - Okay. We'll use this. - Yeah. - Hey! That's my life's savings! - Oh, consider yourself our silent partner. - Yeah, say somethin' and you're dead. - Yeah. - How's the big move goin'? - Great. - Good. - Come on, Ralph. Gotta get to work. Dad? Dad. Well, I-I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided that s-s-since Damien and Ralph have their own room-- - Preston, they need the space for their business. - Not my space. Well, y-young man, in this family, industry gets rewarded. See, while you're in here playing, your brothers are hard at work. -Yeah, kissin' butt for money. -Well, you know the golden rule. - He who has the gold makes the rules. - Right. You know, one of these days, you'll have a job. When I was your age, - I had my own business. - I had my own business. - Cleaning wheels. I was pullin' in... - Cleaning wheels. I was pullin' in... - a hundred bucks a week polishin' cars. - $75-- - You used to say 75. - Well, you gotta think big, Preston. - Always tellin' the same story. You got that? - Surprise. - Check it out. What's that? - Whoa! Check it out! - Yeah, it's for your business. We had a spare at the office. Damien, the speakers are out in the hall. - Uh, how's it work? - Well, it, uh, imitates human intelligence, like you guys. Hey, Preston, maybe you could teach your brothers how to use it. - Not possible. - Well, don't worry, boys. Software in here... will teach you how to do everything but make love to a woman. Mmm, now I know what program to get your father for Christmas. - Mom! - Oops. Oh, here. Let me-- Let me have that. Preston, honey, you're gonna be late for Butch's birthday party. Who wants to celebrate Butch's birth? - It's important to get out of your room more. - Our room. Well, good-bye, guys. Damien and Ralph sleep butt to face. Butt to face.Butt to face. - Who said that?- Butt to face. - Type quit. - Butt to face. Butt to face.- Hit delete. Turn it off! - Butt to face.- Pull the plug, man. - Ow! - Don't rub it. Be a man. - Ouch. - Little wimp. Come on, Preston! You don't want to be late for Butch's birthday party. - So, you gonna have fun today? - How can I, Dad? - I don't have any money. - Ah, look. Here's a couple of bucks. I-- Heck, you can have fun all day on that. You don't get out much, do you, Dad? Welcome to Fun Land.Fun, fun, fun for everyone. Welcome to Fun Land.Fun, fun, fun for everyone. - Hey. Hey, man. - Hey, Butch. Hey, man. Yeah. Hey, what's up? -...to Fun Land.Fun, fun, fun for everyone.-Oh, look! It's Presto the Pesto. Butch. Aww. Tokens! - Gimme 50. It's my birthday. - Fifty. - Twenty-five, please? - Twenty-five. - Twenty-seven. - Twenty-seven. - Six, please. Six. Six. - Coming? - I don't know. - It's gonna be awesome! - Yeah! Let's go over here! - This one! - Hurry! - Hey, Preston. - Preston! Hey, over here. - Hey, Preston, how's your ostrich? - Watch out, Preston! Hey, Preston! Come with us! Just kidding. Did you have fun at Butch's birthday party? I have a question. Are we broke? No, we just have to watch our spending habits. That's right. Like when your mother calls her sister back East and talks for 97 minutes. So, if we're not poverty stricken there must be some other reason I'm so deprived. - We're outta here. - Whoo! Goin' to the ball game. - Can I go? - We bought tickets, toad. - Damien! - You need some cash? - Nah, we got a bunch of change. - Later, Preston. It's not fair. Why can't I have anything? Well, Preston, they have jobs, and they've learned to save. How can I save money if I don't have any? A penny saved is a penny earned. What do you want for your birthday? Money. So I can pay to have Ralph and Damien knocked off. - Anything else? - Well, maybe we'll give him... one of his birthday presents early. A gift came from Grandma today. What a rip-off. It's a check for nothing. I'm having a bad day. Oh, your Grandma just forgot to fill in how much it was for, but she-- she signed it at the bottom, see? It's a blank check. Oh, we'll just fill in the amount. How much did you get last year, honey? - A thousand. - Ten dollars. Wait, Dad. What about inflation? Oh, make it eleven. You'd be surprised how fast $11 can grow with interest. Preston? Preston? Eleven dollars... at 3.45% interest. Your account will reach none million dollars... in 342,506 years. I'm stuck here forever. Lights out up there! - Why? - My house. My rules. My house. My rules. My own house. Dave, who needs assets? I'm your asset. I'm a big asset. - I can't believe you--- Oh, co-- Dave, Dave-- Come on, come on. Why only borrow $150,000? - Our money is your money. Round it off to two. - Do I qualify? Of course you qualify for the loan, Dave. We're golf partners. -You don't look happy to see me. -Quig-- - Quigley. - Quigley. That's funny. I don't remember you stuttering on the witness stand. - You just sang like a bird, didn't ya? - Well, I had no choice, Carl. - I mean, lying in court. - You also pointed at me. That hurt. Well, I was under oath. I mean-- Come here. The only reason you're alive, Biderman, is I knew I might need you again someday.- Like today. - Oh, sure. You need a loan? Rates are great now, and you get a toaster. I don't need a toaster. Before I went away, I put aside a little nest egg. Well, the-- these bills are marked consecutively. -They'd trace these in a minute. -That's right. That's where you come in, old buddy. I want new bills. We're back in the S&L business, Biderman. Oh, no. No, money-- money laundering is very difficult these days, Carl. You still do it, though, don't you? That's a good-looking family right there. You're not gonna hurt them, are you? - Hate to have to. - All right. How do you want to do this? - I'll send my guy in tomorrow with a check for a million. - Tomorrow? Yup, tomorrow. Just like the old days. - You give him the cash, unmarked, send him on his way. - Whom should I expect? Whom sh-- Whom should you expect. His name is Juice. - Juice. - Mmm. He'll be here in exactly, uh, 24 hours. Let's call it 1:00. Come on. Walk me out. Show a little respect. Whoa. I know how you feel. - Hi. - Hi. Can you see okay? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, sure. Uh, I would like to open an account, please? Eleven dollars. Do you have any other money you'd like to deposit, Mr. Waters? Oh, uh, I-I could, but it's sort of hard to save around my house. That's why I'm here. I'm afraid we have a minimum balance. It's $200. Two hundred dollars! That could take a million years. Well, whenever you're ready, please come back and see me, okay? My name's Shay Stanley. Ask for me. Okay, I'll do that. - Thanks. - Bye-bye. - I-I-I'll see you next time? - I hope it's not in a million years. B-B-Bye. Excuse me. Oh. Carl! Carl! Uh, here. You can use these checks. They're temporary. - Thank you, Edward. - Like our relationship. - Sucker! - Give me that! That's mine! Give it to me! Butch, give it to me! - Preston, come on! - Butch! - Give it back! Whoa! - If you can catch me. Whoa! Come on, Butch! Perfect. What the hell do you think you're doin'? - I-I-- - Huh? I saw the whole thing. I can be a witness, if the price is decent. Get out of here. He's perfectly all right. Aren't ya? Aren't ya! - Yes. - Good. Get that thing out from underneath my car. What about my bike? - Kid, was I the one who parked there? - My word! Are you all right? He's fine. It was just a little accident. He's okay. - I think this guy's been drinking vodka. - I have not been drink-- I don't drink at all, seriously. Seriously. Kid, talk to me. -How much you want for the bike? -A thousand bucks! I'm not talking to you! Bye, kid. Go on. Walk away. What do you want, kid? Name a figure. We'll discuss it. Give this to your dad. He'll know what to do with it. I gotta go. - Oh, man. - I thought we understood about taking care of our valuables. Valuable? It was a piece of junk. Well, if that's how you feel about a gift from your parents, I don't see giving you a new one for your birthday. I don't want a new bike. I want my own room. I'm warning you. You're on thin ice as it is about the bike. You know what I want? What I want is my own house. My rules. My money. That's it, young man. Until further notice, you're grounded. What'd I do wrong? Fred. It's a blank check. Preston Waters. Two hundred. A thousand. One million dollars. Cash. One million dollars. Hey, sonny. Cashin' a big one today? Uh, sort of. Yoo-hoo. Over here, young man. - Well? - I-I-I'd like to... cash this check, please. Oh. A comedian. - No-No, ma'am. - Okay, then we better take it to Mr. Biderman. Come on. Excuse me, Mr. Biderman. We have a little problem here. - What is it, Mrs. Udowitz? - Someone thinks this is some kind of game. What? Let me see that. I see. Is there much of a line out there, Mrs. Udowitz? - Yes, we're swamped. - Then what are you doing here? Please. - Juice? - No, thanks. I'm not thirsty. Not thirsty. Mr. Quigley give you this check? - He did. - He did. - How did you run into Mr. Quigley? - I-I didn't. He ran into me. Ah. Brilliant. Brilliant. - Oh. - I suppose you want big bills. Actually, regular size would be okay. Regular. That's cute. -Put your backpack on the table. -Hey, hey. - I assume you know what to do with this. - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. Next. Look here, sweetheart. You're lookin' kinda good there. You got your pearls and everything on. Hate for somethin' to have to happen to 'em. Well, look here. My name is Juice. And I got somethin' right here, and I wondered if you'd be... so kind enough as to cash it for me. What do you want, a million bucks? Well, as a matter of fact, I do. Go see Biderman. Mm-mmm. Oh, my goodness gracious. Here we go. Here we go. You tell Mr. Quigley that he hasn't lost his touch. - Uh-huh. - All right? You can go now. Hey, kid. - Stay away from the racetrack. - Yes, sir. Goodness gracious, looky here. Oh, 'scuse me, sweetie. - What's wrong with you, little boy? - I'm sorry. Don't be a-messin' up a view as good as all that. - I-I'm sorry. - What you doin' out of school anyway, huh? Now you know you oughta be in school. Go on and get up out of here before I decide to get upset. Hurry up. How, uh, how may I help you, sir? Big Juice, man. Quigley sent me. - Everything is fine. Not to worry. - Uh-huh. - The eagle has landed. - Hmm? The horse is in the barn. The chicken is in the pot. Look here, man. I don't know nothin' about no eagles landin' and all of that. I don't know nothin' about no horses runnin' through the barn. And I certainly don't know nothin' about no... chickens bein' in a pot, you understand? But if you'll do me a favor as to be so kind... as to cash this check right there, I could be on my way. Wait. Quigley sent you? - That's right. - What about the kid? - What kid, man? I don't know-- - The kid! - The kid with the backpack! - Look here, man. I'm tired of tellin' you this, but if you don't give me the money for that check, I guarantee you... there's a bullet with your name on it in this chamber. The kid with the backpack! The kid with the backpack! Backpack! Backpack! The kid! Oh, my goodness. One hundred and fifty grand, cash. That's my last offer, guys. You're our realtor. You tell us. This offer is so much less than our asking price. Well, Mrs. Appleton, it really is a buyer's market. Do you mind if we take a minute to think about it? Listen, I got all the time in the world, sweetheart. Too bad I can't say the same for you two. Applesauce, what's with the long face, my man? I bought your pad. You got some cash. It's a beautiful thing. Su casa is soon to be mi casa. You know what I'm sayin'? - Groovin' thing, man. - Yeah, well-- - Hello? - Good afternoon. - ...house.- I'd like to make a cash offer on your house. - Someone else wants to make an offer. - Hey?

Are you tellin' me we're gonna sit here and listen, listen to some talking box... - with a robot voice? What is this? - Uh, 300 it is. Are you, uh, prepared to top 300? No, I don't think I'm prepared to top 300. Are you out of your mind? We had a deal here. Are you realtors just a bunch of crooks? Is that it? What's goin' on with you people? Well, I am sorry you feel that way, but I have an offer on the table of 300. - Thousand.- Uh, we'll take it. - Sold. - Yeah! You probably won't live to enjoy the cash. Just one thing, sir.

Money! - You did what with my money? - You're not gonna believe this. He gave all your money to a little old bitty boy. That was my nest egg. That's all I had to start a new life. I worked hard to steal that money, Biderman! You gave it to some zit-faced little kid? Now wait a minute. I-I seen the kid. His skin looked pretty smooth. - The boy had a check signed by you. - I didn't write a check... - to anybody except for this genius here. - Hey, now, hold on a minute. I'm not the one who cashed the check for a million dollars. That was this man right here. - Had your signature. - I said I didn't write it! You gave me a checkbook. I put it in my pocket. I got in my car. I-- I-- I can't feel my legs. - I-- Oh, oh, oh. - Calm down. I've got a surveillance photo of the boy. W-W-We'll find him in no time. - Oh, yeah, that's him.

No, no, no. They-- They-- They have listings. Uh, uh, family activities where th-- uh, wh-where, you know, things where kids go. - See? - Fine. You're gonna help me find him, you understand? Dead or alive. Let's get out of here. Oh, don't think you ain't comin' along with us. Somebody's in there with Biderman now. A couple of guys I've never seen before. They've just left. The money laundering is definitely on again. We've gotta notify the Bureau right away. Hello, Limousines Unlimited. - You have the car keys? - No, you have the car keys. - Oh, yeah.

I thought he just moved here. There was a Tangerino where I used to live. Hmm? Oh. Compliments of the chef for Mr. Waters... and his lovely guest. They-- They look like lobsters only... weenie. Oh. M-Mr. Macintosh wanted you to have this too. Oh, thanks. Oh, wow. This is beautiful. Oh. But I can't accept this from you. But it's from Mr. Macintosh. - Why? - Just a little business gift. I mean, it's deductible, isn't it? I'm not really sure, but it's way too expensive. Mr. Macintosh has a million dollars. You know, a million dollars doesn't buy all that much these days. Do you think he should've asked for more? What exactly does he do, anyway? Oh, little of this and little of that. - You know. - No, I'm afraid I don't. - Oh. - Is he an entrepreneur? No, he's American. Very secretive. He-- He has some questions for you too. Okay. Shoot. - Are you married? - No. What-- What's the shortest guy you ever dated? Mmm, I'm not really sure. - The youngest? - You know, these are pretty personal questions. Well, Mr. Macintosh is very interested in you. - He is? - He, uh-- He's never met anybody like you before. He's never met me before period. Technically, no, but, he's been thinking a lot about you lately. - He has? - Yep. Preston! Are you okay? - Do you like hamburgers? - I love hamburgers. Never saw this kid before in my life. This is a waste of time. Come on. What's so special about this place? - You'll see. - Mm, come on. Tell me. - Okay. - You gonna tell me? - Come with me. - All right. - Where are you taking me? - You'll see. - See what? - Okay, get in the middle. - Here? - Okay, ready? Five, four, three, two, one. - Holy smokes. - Okay! Okay, now come over. - Okay. Okay, now grab onto me. - I don't believe this! Okay. Okay, now give it some room. - Don't get wet. - Get us out. Oh, my god! Okay, okay. - No, we're gonna get soaked. - No, now come-- come around here. Come around here. - Okay, hold onto me. - Hey, where are you? - Preston! - Whoa, yeah! This was a great idea, Biderman. Where's all the kids, huh? Carl, it's late at night. I mean, all the little boys and girls are tucked in bed. - What do you expect? - What I expect is when I give someone a million dollars, and I come back a day later, I find the million dollars; that's what I-- - That's what I expect! - Carl, I'm, I'm-- Carl, I'm not a magician. Oh, no, you can make it disappear. You just can't get it back, right? - I'm tellin' you, Carl, I-- - If y'all want a kid so bad, - there go one right over there. - That's the little boy from the bank! Shh. Shh. - Go get him ! - Oh, I'll race ya to the limo! - What? Okay, I'll race ya. - I'll race ya to the limo! - I got the door for ya! - Open the door. I'm freezing! Go, Henry! Go, Henry, go! All right, here we go! He got away again! I don't believe this! He got away again! This was the most fun. I haven't done anything like this since I was a little kid. - Me neither. - Thank you so much. When can I see you again? Well, I really have to spend some time with my job, you know, right now.

You know, dew-drop, I think I should meet him because... I'm gonna need a little cash deposit. Oh, uh, here. Let me get you some cash. Ooh, yes, you do have money, don't you? - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - You better be careful walkin' around... with this much money darling; somebody could just rip you right off. Now you know what?This first $10,000 is gonna Now, of course, I'll get the balance at the party. And Mr. Macintosh is good for it? I am just so looking forward to meeting him. - Who isn't? - Waiters!

All right? - Is something wrong? - No, not at all. Is Mr. Macintosh around? - Ah, no. - But he will be here tonight. - Yeah. - In person. - In person. - Okay. I'll see you tonight? - Okay. - Okay. You're looking good. Bye. I'll be calling. What a babe. Baby brother comes into his own. For a little weasel, he sure knows how to get a girlfriend. - Ah, too bad he picked a fortune hunter. - Little love pilot, shot down in flames by a gold digger. By a what? Gold digger, someone who is only after money. I know women. And that one's after Macintosh's cold, hard cash. Well, for your information, me and Shay already went on a date and, uh, shared one fantastic time, boys. Oh, yes. Every second she was getting closer... - and closer to Mr. Macintosh. - Shut up! Just answer me this. Did she ever, ever just once come by without saying, Meanwhile, I wonder if I can see Mr. Macintosh? - She's a gold digger, man. She just wants Macintosh's money. - Yeah. - Don't rub it. Be a man. - Yeah, don't rub it. - She wants a guy with money, not some little kid... - Yeah. with an empty piggy bank. Well, I'll wait by the windows I'll wait by the door To make sure you don't come home You ever know any gold diggers? Man, have I. I hate 'em. They're the worst. The way I look at it, you know, anybody who's your friend... because you have money is not your friend at all. That's it. You know what they say about gold. He who has the gold makes the rules? No, no, no, no, no, no. A fool and his gold are soon parted. - What does that mean? - A fool and his gold are soon parted? Those old sayings, man. I don't get 'em. I don't even know really what that means. You ever heard that more than one way to skin a cat? Have you heard that one? Who skins cats? Why would you skin a cat? And there is not more than one way to skin a cat. There is only one way to skin a cat. You grab the cat; you rip the skin off the cat. What is the number two way? Think about it. Wh-What, do you put a hose up the cat's butt? He gets so bloated that he skins himself? What does he-- What does he have... a little piece of velcro under his butt there; we just, like, un-velcro him? No. Kill two birds with one stone. You heard that one? Whew. Do you know anyone who has even killed one bird with one stone? Kids try it all the time. You can't hit a bird with a stone. Unless you got a big huge stone and they're little, tiny baby birds. Then-- Beep, beep. Dead. Huh, A fool and his gold are soon parted. I guess it means that if you're a fool, your gold or your money is soon gone. And once it's gone, it is outta there; it is history. It is dust. It is vapor. It is no more. You are living in Brokesville. - Unless you have Macintosh's kind of money, and then-- - What if you don't? Well, I guess then you find out who your real friends are. Man, we look good. Is everybody having a good time? - Good. You are. - Yes, well, we are, darling. Wow, look at the balloons! This is great! - Look at the ice sculpture over here! - Presents! Hey, hey, hey, hey, kid, no touching. These are Mr. Macintosh's. Well, go find your parents. Go on. Get outta here. Go on! - I just want to see this Macintosh. - I just want to pig out. Hey, look at this. Excuse me. - Sorry. - Exactly, uh, who are you looking for there, Preston? - Have you seen Shay? - Gosh, no, I haven't seen her, but she'll be around. She'll be here somewhere. Come on. Let's have-- Oh, man, look at all this food! If Macintosh doesn't show, we bring the kid in, agreed? If Preston says Macintosh is gonna be there, Macintosh will be there. But you don't make a move until I give you the signal. - Understood? - We got eight men ready to go in there... and nail him the second he shows up. We close this deal tonight! Where's the pizza and the ice cream? Wh-What's goin' on here? This could've been a pizza before it got run over by a couple of trucks. Could've been. Oh, oh, that looks tasty. Looks like something you'd find between your toes, doesn't it? It-- It's suckin' the life out of me! It's suckin' the life out of me! - Shut up! Everybody's looking at you. - So what? Who cares? Come on. Relax. Have a good time. She'll show up. Oh, there's Shay now! Hah, just kiddin'. I was kiddin' ya. Would you just relax? She'll be here. Man. It's not at all what you thought it would be like, eh, being rich, huh? Preston? Preston? Ah, ice cream, ice cream. Yoo-hoo, Preston. Now where is our mystery man? It's time for Mr. Macintosh to make his appearance. You see, I like to give my employers their bills directly. That way, if they have any questions or heart attacks or somethin'-- - Well, I'll give it to him. - Fine. Be quick about it. $100,000? Sweetheart, I know this seems like a whole lot of money to normal people like me and you.But to a man like Macintosh, Now you get up there and get me my money! I'll get your money. Party. $100,000. - Not a problem. You can leave it. - This is fine. - Have a good night. - I'll be right back. Thank you. Transaction: not possible. Insufficient funds. Current balance: $332.17. - Three-hundred dollars! - Transaction: not possible. - Insufficient funds.Transaction: not possible.- Oh, no. - No, please, God. - Insufficient funds. This can't be right. One, two, three, four-- It's gone. It's all gone. Mr. Macintosh? Oh, sorry to bother you. It's Fred Waters, Preston's dad. I know you got a bash going on here, so I'll make it brief. But, uh-- I wanted to ask you a-a favor. You see, today is Preston's birthday and if you see him, if you could send him home a little early-- You know, lately he's been working so hard. All of a sudden, money's become so important to him. I guess that's mostly my fault. You don't have kids, do you, Mr. Macintosh? Well, I tell you, it's very easy to make mistakes with them. I haven't always paid enough attention to my kids. I pushed them too hard, you know, maybe. Especially Preston. I guess I, uh, expect more from him. He reminds me of myself at that age. I couldn't wait to grow up. I'm afraid he's missing out on his childhood. So am I. Well, uh, thanks. I won't take up any more of your time. And we appreciate you sending Preston home early. Well, if he, if he wants to come, that is. - Yeah, I want to come home. - Thanks. Dad. Dad? Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, wait! Daddy! Henry! Henry! Wait a minute. Where's Henry? Your driver? He left a little while ago. He-- He left? Are you sure it was Henry? Big guy, white limo. He's gone. Thanks. Now I know who my friends are. Excuse me. Sorry. Preston? Mr. Macintosh? - Mr. Macintosh? - It's just me. -Which one of us did you want? -I was looking for you, Preston. - Oh, good. - And Mr. Macintosh. Look, it's very, very important that I find Mr. Macintosh right now. Do you understand? He's no wheres. He's gone. And I think you better leave too. - Preston, you could be in danger. - Just go, okay? Get your necklace and just take it and leave. Give it back There's no time to lose So give it back Give it back Riggs? Riggs? Riggs? - Looks like no one's home. - Shut up, Wienerman. - Biderman. - Where is he? - I don't know, but he might be down the street... at Mr. Macintosh's; that's his boss. Macintosh. Come on! You know, I do like what they have done with this color. Mm-mmm-mmm. There you are, puppy-butt. - Did you get me my money? - Uh, Macintosh has disappeared. What? Now, I am warning you, Tom Thumb. Don't you trifle with me. If I don't get paid, I will sue Mr. Macintosh for every dime he is worth! Well, be sure and tell me when you find him. Okay, little Mr. Man, this party is over! Quiet! Stop that playing! Stop that music! Quiet! Attention! Attention! Attention! Everybody, this party is over! Our host can't pay his bills. Mr. Macintosh is a fraud! She's right. I hate to tell you this, but there's been a terrible mistake, and nobody sh-should've been invited. Macintosh is-- is gone. And he's not coming back. So I think you should all leave too. So, go. - Go on. - Close down the bar! Come on. Let's get out of here! Come on, Antoine. Move it! Come on. Move it! Move it! Come back here with those glasses! Y'all forcin' me-- Give me that! You-- Henry? Henry? I knew you'd come back. Henry! Happy birthday. I'm here to blow out your candles. - What's your hurry, kid? You got a big check to cash? - Yeah. No! - Let me go! - I like this pad. What do you think, Juice? Oh, yeah. I like the pad. It looks real nice. - Can you handle it? Got the TV. - Oh, I like this. TV. - Drums. All kind of toys. - Drums. You got a little taste, little flavor. - What's this thing here? - I don't know. I don't think I've seen one of those before. - Preston, how do you work this? - Well, you turn the knob. You know, you really shouldn't let him in such a nice house as this. I mean, all your stuff could get broken. Kid, where's Macintosh? N-Nowhere. He's nowhere. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Where is he? - Huh? - Th-There is no Macintosh. I made him up. I-It was me the whole time. Don't give me that. Who bought this house? I-I did. You? You outbid me? Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You tryin' to tell me... that this little bitty boy right here... outbid you with your own money? Be a fly on the wall, okay, Juice? Listen, kid. You know it's illegal to take things that don't belong to you. I know. I feel awful. Take me to the police. Carl, don't do it. It's a trick. Get out of here. Son, I don't want to take you to the police. Just tell me, okay? Where's my money? I-- I spent it. - All of it? - All of it. How could you spend a million dollars... in six days? You must not have been shoppin' lately. Carl, Carl, wait a minute. Maybe we're thinking about this Macintosh thing in the wrong way. - What are you talking about? - Well, you needed a new house, a new identity. Well, this kid-- He's done it for you. I mean, Macintosh could run for mayor here. Yeah, I kinda like the idea of that. - Uh, Mayor Quigley. Yeah. - No, no. Mayor Macintosh. I like it. Look, there's only one problem with that. There-- - Hey! - Get back here! - Wait for me! Wait for me! I'm comin'! I'm comin'! - Get upstairs, man. Get in there. Break it down! Break it down! Come on! There he is! - Where is he? Where is he? - He went down there. - Juice, go after him. Go on! - I ain't goin' down there. - You're crazy, man. I ain't goin' down there. - Come on. Watch your head. - What is it, about 230-- Whoa! - It's okay. - Let's go. - I'm not goin'-- I'm not goin' in there. - Oh, no, he didn't! - Did you see him? - Oh, no, you did just push me in the pool like that! - Get out of there! - Come on. We gotta find him. - Boy, you must be crazy. What? What happened? Biderman, act like you got a purpose in life. Go! I think I'm experiencing chest pains. Oh! Carl! Juice! Little boy? Little boy from the bank? Oh, my god! Where am I? I hate this! Gotcha! Hey! Got it. Time for a little batting practice. Here we go! Hey. What's happenin', yo? Hey, ho, hey! - Just outside.

Get him, you guys! - All right, hold him. - I got a baseball for you. - You're not a very nice boy. Freeze ! Preston, are you okay? What's this all about? What's happenin' here? Miss Stanley, what are you doing here? - Let go! - As of this moment, you're fired from my bank! FBI, Biderman. From this moment, you're fired from your bank. - What? - You're with the FBI? - Yes, Preston, I am. - Okay, kid, finally, at long last, who's Macintosh? Um, uh, u-uh, uh, - um, I-- - I'm Macintosh. - You're Macintosh? - I'm Macintosh, and I want you all off my property now! - He's Macintosh. - You're sure? I tell you I'm Macintosh! Please tell these guys I'm Macintosh. - Oh, he's Macintosh. Don't you know Papa Macintosh? - Mr. Macintosh. - He's Macintosh. And Big Mama Macintosh be hangin' out with the brothers, you know? Okay then, Mr. Macintosh, you're under arrest for fraud, money laundering and grand theft. - What are you talking about?

Come on! - Take it easy! - I'm a banker! You can't do this! - I'm not even from here, man. I was rollin' down the street. - I'm a banker. - Cat said, Hey, there's a party. - I own-- I own a bank! Sir, stay behind the line there. Everyone, just calm down. Okay? Honey, I'm gonna check this out, make sure that Preston's okay. You take the boys home? - What's, uh, what's going on here? - I don't know. Something to do with Mr. Macintosh. The FBI's all over the place. - Uh, have you seen, have you seen a little boy? - He's inside with the FBI. - Excuse me, excuse me, please. Officer-- - Whoa, whoa ! - Nobody gets in there without a badge. - I-I-I'm looking for my son. - Kinda neat. Can I see your badge? - Shay Stanley, FBI. Cool. Wait a minute. So that means our date... was just for your-- just for your job? Well, it started out like that. -I should've known. -Hey, you know, I wouldn't have traded that night for anything. So, when can I see you again, Shay? Hmm. Why don't you give me a call in, say, about ten years. - Five. - Seven. - Six. Okay. It's a date. Good night, Preston. Preston! Preston? Oh, my god, he's in shock. Oh, I'm fine, Dad. I'm fine now. Oh, I'm glad to see you. - Well, what's going on here? - Oh, it's a long story. - Well, why don't we go on home and you tell me all about it. - Okay. I want to say good-bye to a friend, okay, Dad? Well, this is just great. I can't step out for a couple seconds. I miss all the action. Thanks. Are you okay? - I thought you left, man. - No, I didn't leave. What did we say the party needed? Ice cream, right? I just went to get ice cream. I don't know if I got the exact recipe, but I think I got it close. - So? - Hey, it's, uh, pretty close. Well, I guess, uh, Macintosh is no more, huh? It's too bad because, uh, I really enjoyed, uh, workin' for him. I had a good time too. Do me a favor? Next time you see him, t-tell him, uh, that I-I'm really gonna miss him. I'll miss you too, Henry. You're gonna do just fine. See ya. - Hey, Henry. - Huh? - Know what you have? - What? - S-T-Y-L-E. Style. - Style. Hey, Preston! You're not gonna finish this ice cream, I guess, huh? Well, no sense lettin' this go to waste. So, uh, what happened? Oh, well, uh-- Macintosh wasn't-- He-- - He wasn't who he thought he was. - How do you mean? He shouldn't have done what he did. I mean, he shouldn't have fooled everybody. I think you're right. It's been a long night. Better get on up to bed. Yeah, I think you oughta get some sleep too, Dad. And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about Mr. Macintosh. - Sleep well, Preston. - Ta-da!
