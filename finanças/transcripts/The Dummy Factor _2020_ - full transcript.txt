- Hey, Noel. Did you spill something outside the upstairs bathroom? Your mother said she stepped in a puddle this morning. Pissed yourself again, eh? - Jason. - Can I play with Oscar now? - Ah, you just finish your milk first. Oh, where'd you get that? - Granville Island. - Hm, when? - Um, yesterday? - You wanna go to the park and play soccer? - Sure. Just gonna tell my mum. Mum, I'm gonna go play soccer with Noel in the park. See ya. So what park do you wanna go to? I'm thinking Maple Grove. Bet I can get to Maple Grove before you. - I bet you can't. - Yo, but taking this. No! - Did you see that movie last night? - No, my mom made me go to bed before it started. - It was totally freaky. Eight people were killed. I counted. First one was a boy who got snatched from his bed while he was sleeping, then they found this girl tied to a post on the sidewalk. Gross. What's that kid doin' over there? - I don't know. - Yo, Oscar, I got this new trick. Watch this. Oh, damn it. - Hah, where'd you learn it? - Shut up. - You wanna come over? - I can't. I gotta do my paper route. Mr. Sherman was waiting on his doorstep yesterday. Can't get a complaint filed. - Okay. See ya. - See ya, Oscar. - Hey, little Noel man. Better watch out on your route today. - Wait, why? - Says here some kid went missin' a few days ago outside a supermarket in Marpole. Cops think he might've been snatched by some psycho. - I gotta go. I'm serious, man! You might be next. - "Kevin Day failed to return home on Friday after going to the store to pick up a carton of milk. Witnesses reported seeing him talking to a man with brown hair and glasses. He is the second child to go missing in the last seven months." - Hello, Noel! Is that my paper? - Uh, yeah. - Thank you so much. Do you mind bringing it at the same time every day? - Okay. - Goodbye. - Man, these graphics are awesome. - Mum wants to know if you want potatoes or rice. Jason. Jason! - What? - Potatoes or rice? - I don't know, I... Look what you made me do. - Just go tell Mum. - Fine. - Stop! - So, Noel man, any problems on your route today? Rice! I said- - What do you mean? - I want rice. The supermarket psycho didn't come after you? Who is the supermarket psycho? - That guy that grabbed that kid the other day. Now he's out to get Noel. - Really? - Shut up, he's not! - Hey, is that my man? - Yeah. I'm gonna sic the psycho on you. - There's no such thing as a supermarket psycho, right? - Hm? - There's no such thing as a supermarket psycho, right? - You read the paper. I didn't make it up. - Oh, man. Oh, I hope it's not. - What? - No, it's nothing. It couldn't be him. Could it? - Who could it be? What're you talking about? - Nah, I really shouldn't. - I'm telling Mom! - No, no, don't do that. You mustn't. Okay, I guess you got a right to know. So remember how, like, uh, two years ago, I came home early from camp? - I'm not sure I- - Remember? Mum and Dad were supposed to pick me up on the Saturday but they ended up picking me up on the Wednesday? You couldn't come in 'cause you had some sort of soccer lesson or something? - Oh, that's right. I had to go to Oscar's house after. - Well, what they never told you was the actual reason I came home early. It's because the camp was canceled. - No way. Why? - That, my friend, all started one night when a kid in my cabin decided to take a leak. What are you doing? - I'm going to the bathroom. - Okay! Stupid... So, the next morning, I'm getting dressed, getting ready to go for breakfast, and when my counselor asks if anyone knows where Jake is- - Hey, does anyone know where Jake is? I told him that I thought I remembered him waking me up last night before he went to the bathroom. - When was that? - Uh... I don't know. - Well, he's probably already at the dining hall. But it turns out he wasn't. Jake? Jake! They got everyone together and did a big search, but Jake was never found. - Jake! - Jake! - Jake, where are you? - Jake! - Jake! - Jake! I guess they probably should've sent us all home right then and there, but for some reason, they didn't. Why not? I just said I don't know! Jake! Maybe if they had, maybe then I wouldn't have seen... What, what did you see? Jason, what did you see? The worst thing I've ever seen in my whole entire life. Something I'll like never forget. - Hey, we were playing here! You owe us a ball! - Go get it from Cargo. Fine. Cargo was the groundskeeper. That was part of the thing at camp. Cargo? All the staff and the counselors had nicknames. Cargo? Cargo. I'm, uh, I need another soccer ball. It was kind of a game to try and figure out as many of their real names as possible. Cargo? It was pretty easy with most of them, but not Cargo. Nobody ever figured out who he really was. Cargo had this thing about his equipment. He kept them all in this big metal trunk in his shed. If you needed something, you had to go and ask him. You were never allowed to just get it yourself. But he kept this monster padlock on it. Except that day. For some reason, he had forgotten to lock it. I was looking through it, trying to find a soccer ball. I moved something in the way and that's when I see it. It was Jake. He was dead. What? What did you do? Got the hell outta there. And then I saw him, Cargo, across the field by the forest. That was the last time anyone saw him. And just like that... He disappeared. Obviously, after that, the camp was canceled. Everyone's parents were called. Mum and Dad came and picked me up. End of story. - But Cargo's still out there. - Well, yeah. Guess he is. Dinner! - Do Mom and Dad know? - Well, most of it anyway. Look, man, you gotta promise not to tell anyone what I told you today, all right? - But why? - 'Cause I said so. That's why. - But... Hey! Hey, stop, stop! Don't. Okay, okay, okay, I won't talk. - Don't. Tell. Anyone. Geesh. That was aggressive. - Okay, as long as you guys stay here, without touching the ground, as long as you don't leave the bed, I think you'll be safe. - What's goin' on? - I'm just building a fort. - Hm. - Cubby said that the others were scared, so he said that I should bring them together and then they'd be safe. - Oh! He did, did he? - It's sort of like James's peach. If everyone's in like this, nothing on the outside can get them. - Hm. Makes sense. And now it's time for you to get into bed, under cover as well. - Fine. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Don't let the bed bugs bite. Goodnight, guys. I got this new puppet yesterday. It's so cool. What's it look like? It's missing an eye and it kind of looks like a elf. Does it have pointy ears? Oh, I forgot. - You forget? Didn't you just say you got it yesterday? - Well, my mind hurts when I'm at school. We've been in school for six hours. You can't expect my mind to work. - Hey. How was your day? - Meh. It was fine. I got a notice for you. - Oh. What's this about? - I don't know. - Oh, Noel. Under the tap. - Hm. That's weird. - Eat your broccoli. Noel, your mother and I have something serious we wanna talk to you about. - What? - You're adopted. Sorry, man. Jason! - It's about the notice you brought home from school. Did Miss Race talk to you about it? - I don't know. Well, did she or didn't she? - She just gave it to us and said "Give it to your parents." - Oh, you in trouble now! - You need to hear this too, Mr. Smart Mouth. - It's about something that happened to one of your classmates the other day. - What do you mean? - Well, according to this, on Thursday, a grade three student reported that she was followed home after school. She describes the individual as being an older male who wore a brown jacket. That's Cargo. Ow! - Did you just kick him? - Nope. - Your father and I think that you, and you, should be extra careful. And that means if you see anything weird or out of the ordinary, tell us. And you're coming home straight after school and doing your papers. I don't want you out after dark. - But what if I wanna play at someone's house? - This isn't open for negotiation. - But- - It's either that or you're gonna have to give up your paper route. Is that what you want? - No. - So? Do we have an agreement? - Yeah, I guess. What do you guys think about that notice that was sent home yesterday? - Oh, I heard it was Cindy from grade two. - No way. - What about Cindy? What're you talking about? - My parents are totally freaked. They don't want me to do my paper route after dark now. - Why? - 'Cause they don't want the guy who followed Cindy home to get him. - I'm thinking it was the same guy that snatched that kid from the supermarket last week. Wait. What kid? - He, uh... I read about it in the paper. Some kid went to the supermarket at Marpole and just disappeared. - Marpole? - Maybe it's that guy who lives on Cypress. - You mean the guy that lives in that house? - Nah. Can't be him. - I bet it totally is, though. That's what they said on the news. - What news? I never read about that in the paper. - Well, that's because it was just on TV. - Really? - Yeah, I heard it last night. They said the police thought there was a molester living in there, but they don't know where! Was a molester? - You mean a molester? - Yeah, same thing. - I think we should go check it out. - What do you mean? - I think we should go investigate after school. - Oh, totally. - I don't think that's a good idea. - I think if we all go, he wouldn't dare to do anything. - But what about your paper route? You said you couldn't do it late. - This is way more important. What do you think Joe and Frank Hardy would do? - And Encyclopedia Brown. - Yeah, him too. Okay, meet here after school. - Hey, you guys. Think they'll give us a reward for catching him? - Maybe. - Chawesome. Jessica, Amanda! Time to go in! Go. Hurry up. - So, Noel, what're you gonna get with your share? - Uh, I think I'm gonna get Stretch Armstrong. Ah. Good choice. - Oscar, what you gonna get? - Oh, I'm gonna get a pet raccoon. - You can't get a pet raccoon. - Honestly, what is your obsession with raccoons? - Oh, well, once when I was in Stanley Park, someone dropped a bag of peanuts and there was a river of raccoons. You couldn't see the ground. You've told us this story so many times. Like, chill out. Well, I haven't told you the part that a raccoon hissed at me. Yes. You, you have. Oh. Okay. - So, you guys, if a turkey and a chicken had a fight, no weapons, who do you think would win? - Oh, this is it. - Sorry. Sorry. - Hey, you can't go rushing in like that. What if he's watching? - Wait. Do you think he might be? - Let's think about this for a second. Oscar, is there anything we need to know about this news report before we do this? - I don't know. I think all they said is that he lived on Cypress. - So what's the plan? Go! Go, walk. - No. No way. Nuh-uh. I don't wanna be the bait! - Nothing's gonna happen to you. - Yeah, come on, ya dorkus. Just do it! - Oh, crap. Fine. And don't look at the house. Get down. Look at the window, look in there. - Okay. Looks like nobody's home. What do we do now? - I guess we just look for clues. - All right. Coast is clear. So gross. - Don't leave footprints. Shh! - No, you shh. - Both of you, shut up. Hey! Hey, you guys, I found something. What is it? - It's a glove. I found this glove. - That's totally the type of glove a molester would use. Hey, don't touch it. Don't touch it. You just touched it right there! - Not with my hand. - Hm, that's smart. Oh, crap! - Eww! Dude, the molester killed a bird. Oh, gross. - We should go home now. It's kinda scary. - Yeah, this guy's crazy. - Shh, shh, shh. It's a car. He's home, he's home! He's home! Let's get outta here! Guys, wait up! Uh, Noel? Where have you been and where are you going? What did we talk about last night? - Uh, to eat my broccoli? - Don't get lippy with me, young man. So? Did you forget or are you just being willfully disobedient? - I didn't forget, it was just some of my friends were doing something and I wanted to do it, too. - Well, we'll see what your dad has to say, but I hope you're prepared to be grounded. But I was supposed to have a sleepover at Oscar's. - You should've thought about that, before you stayed out so late. Oh, come on, Mom! Please? It won't happen again. - No, no. I'm not having this conversation. Please? Please? Please. Please! - Okay. I tell you what. If you come home right after school tomorrow, and on Friday and you do your route at the proper time, then we'll keep this just between us, okay? - Thanks, Mom. Well, where are you going now? - Uh, to do my route. - It's dark! Let me get my keys. I will drive you. Now, don't give Cynthia a hard time, okay? Eat whatever she gives you. Bye bye. Have fun. You forgot something! Hey, Cynthia. Thanks for taking him. Good luck. - Welcome to my lair. That was perfectly placed! - It was just a giant pile. - What do you want for dinner? - I don't know. - My mom said we could have anything. Like, I mean anything. Do you like mac and cheese? - Yeah, I guess. What about pancakes? - What about mac and cheese on pancakes? - Yeah. Sounds good. - How about with syrup as well? - That, that sounds kinda grotty. - Oh. You wanna play Dummy tonight? - I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't. - Why not? - What're you doing? - Something. Hi, I'm Noel. I'm too afraid to play Dummy. Don't worry. There's nothing to fear as long as Oscar's near. Turn off the light. - Just one more chapter. We got him. Did you see that? - Yeah, they totally picked it up to check if it was- - We totally fooled them. Let's do it again. But another street, yeah. Uh, what street? How about Marpole? Oh, no. That's where the psycho is. How about Maple? Yeah, sure. Let's go there. It's the car! Let's go, let's go, let's go! - Come on, let's go! = Oh crap. Come on! Come on, let's go! - Come on, hurry up. - I'm trying! - Grab the dummy! - I got him! Grab the dummy! He's got it, he's got it! Oh, crap! Let's go! I think we're okay. I don't think they're following us anymore. That was crazy. Who were they? - I don't know. It's getting pretty late. I think we should be heading back. - I don't wanna lug this thing back to your place. - Well, we're pretty close to yours, so... Let's just stash it out in your backyard or somethin'. - All right, but it's your turn to carry it. Fine. This thing's so annoying. Dude, be really quiet. Okay. So where should we put it? - Okay, just follow me. Pass it to me. It's him. It's him. - That was your brother. - Yeah, I know. - What did she feed you last night? - Macaroni and pancakes. - Noel. That's not... Your bags? Well, that's no kind of dinner. I'm gonna call Cynthia 'cause this is the second time. I mean, last time, what was it? It was... It was, like, undercooked chicken. How much sleep did you get? - I don't know. - Hey Yawny. I think somebody needs a nap. - Where are you going? - To do my route. - You haven't done that yet? It's already dark out. - I was sleeping. - You better hurry up. Your mother and I aren't gonna be here when you get back. - Wait, why? - We're going out. - What about dinner? - I gave your brother some money. You guys can order somethin'. - Wait, with Jason? - Do you have another brother? - I guess not. - Yeah, he already knows he has to stay home with you tonight. - But- - No buts! Hurry! Go, go! - Hello? Hello? Mom? Dad? Jason? Jason? What? Where are you goin'? I'm going out. - But Dad said you had to stay home. Yeah, well he's isn't here now, is he? - But what about dinner? Oh, yeah. Um... Look, here's a 20. Just call the pizza man or somethin'. - How am I supposed to do that? I've never done it before. - I don't know. About time you figured it out for yourself. - Jason! - Look, I have to go, okay? I'm sorry, I just... I'll see you later. - Uh... Hi, my name's Noel. Uh, can I order a pizza? Can I please have a small pepperoni pizza with cheese, green peppers and anchovies, please? I got a pizza. I'm gonna eat it now. You suck. I killed you. Here he goes. Stupid dummy. So, this is the Lochless Monster. I made it. I made it out of clay and then I gave it to my grandma and she put it in the kiln and then, uh, heated it up. Then painted it and gave it back. She did a good job. The teeth look really sharp, but they're really not. They're just super blunt, actually. It's kind of weird. This is my teddy bear. His name is Cubby and I sleep with him every night. He's my good bear. I like him a lot. And this. This is a giant frog that I won at the carnival by playing whack-a-mole, those stupid frickin' moles. Okay, your move. That was a pretty good move for a dummy. Yeah, his name is Cargo. He killed some kid at my brother's camp two years ago. And apparently he just disappeared. I think he's back. He snatched some kid named Kevin. And another kid named Lisa. And he followed Cindy home. Yeah, he lives on Cypress. We checked his house out and, uh, I think those kids are still locked in his basement. Yeah. I'm tired, too. I think we should go to bed now. But don't worry, I'll protect you. Hey. What the? The hell is this? Sophie! Sophie! Sophie! You better get up here! - I'm at the other end of the house. I can't hear you. - Noel's not in his room. - Where is he? - I don't know. This thing was in his bed. - What the heck is that? - Some kind of stuffed person. - Uh, yeah. I can see that, but where'd it come from? - How should I know? - You don't think he snuck out, do you? - No, I don't think he'd do that. He's not Jason. - Yeah, not yet. Well, he can't have just disappeared. He's gotta be around here somewhere. - Oh. Those kids that went missing. - What about them? - You don't think... - You think Noel was abducted? - I don't know. That girl. She was taken right out of her own bed. They say whoever did it came in through the bedroom window. - You're freaking me out, Len. - Yeah, well... Noel? Are you in here? What's goin' on? - You really gave us quite a scare. Sorry. What was that thing doing in your bed? Where did you get it, anyway? - I don't know. - Come on, Noel. I think you can do better than that. - I guess I didn't... - Didn't what? - I just thought if Cargo came into my room to kidnap me, he'd find the dummy instead of me and he would leave. - Nobody's gonna kidnap you. We promise. - No! If Cargo wants to get me, he'll find a way to get me. He's already got Kevin, Jake and Lisa. - What's Cargo? - Who are Jake and Kevin and Lisa? - You can stop pretending. Jason told me what happened, so please, just stop pretending. - He did? - Yeah, he told me about what happened at his camp two summers ago. - Which was what, exactly? - Jake's murder! And they closed the camp down and that's why Jason came home early. - Your brother told you all that? - Yeah. - And this Cargo was... - The man who killed Jake. He worked at the camp and Jason found Jake's body in Cargo's trunk. - Uh-huh. Jason! - No! Please, don't tell him I told you! - It's all right. It's okay, it's all right. Jason? I need you to get upstairs this instant. - Drink your cocoa. All right, all right. Bloody hell. What did you say to me? - It's okay. You're not in any trouble. All right, I'm here. What's the big deal? Where did that come from? - It's mine. - Your brother here told us quite the story. - Oh? Huh? - What were you thinking, scaring him like that? - Look, I don't know what he told you, but I- - He told us that you told him that two years ago, you came home early from camp because there was a murder there. Is that true? Is that what you said? Oh, yeah. That. Seriously! - Well, that's what happened, isn't it? - You better wipe that smile off your face. - The actual real reason your dad and I had to pick up your brother was because he got caught, trying to light an outhouse on fire. - Wait, what do you mean? - What your mother means is that the camp didn't close early, nobody died there. Your big brother was just lying to you. Isn't that right, Jason? Oh, man. You're so stupid. I can't believe you fell for it. - You mean there's no Cargo? - Well, yeah, there's a Cargo, but he was just some dweeb that handed out volleyballs. - But... - Oh, he was totally suck- - All right, that's enough out of you. You go back to bed. - Oh, Cargo's gonna get ya! - Don't you think this is the end of it! - What is wrong with you? Would you like more cocoa? - No. I'm just gonna go to bed now. - Aww. - Ah! Get out of my room, jerk! I said, get out! - Well, Mum told me to come up and apologize, so... I have to admit, that was a pretty good trick you pulled on me last night. I can't believe I didn't recognize you. Were you the one I had the tug of war with? - Yeah. Was that Cory in the car? - Yeah. So you knew it was me? - Yeah. - Well, I guess I owe you one for not snitching, then. - Why were you dressed in black? - All right, if I tell you this, you gotta promise not to tell Mum and Dad. - I promise. - No, I'm being serious. - I cross my heart and hope to die. - Okay, well, me and Cory have this... Yeah, well, we have this game where we go into people's houses at night and we just kinda like walk around while they're sleeping. - So you're a robber? - No, no, no, no. We don't actually take anything. Well, we started leaving little notes, like to let them know we're there. But yeah, other than that, we just walk around. - But why? - Well, we got this whole point system going. So, basically, for every minute that you're in a house, you get like five points and then you go to different rooms and you can only be in one room for 30 seconds at each time. Then if there's people in the room, you get like 20, but if there's two people sleeping in the room, you get like 30 and you also get a point for each second you're actually in that room. - How many points do you got? - 175. - How many does Cory have? - 123. You're kickin' his butt! - I know, that's 'cause I got like 63 last Friday night. - How do you pick the houses anyway? Can you do it to anybody's? - Well, we check them out first. Make sure there's no alarm system or dog that barks. We also need to find an unlocked window. So usually it takes a bunch of houses before we can actually find one we get into. - Do you think if I told you about a house, you could get into it? Uh, I don't know, maybe. Where is it? - It's that one where that weird guy lives. - You mean the house on Cypress? - Yeah, the TV said that there's a molester living there. I was wondering if you could go see if those missing kids were in there. - Whoa, wait, wait. You think they're in that house? - Yeah, that's what the TV said. I searched it and found some clues. Do you think you could do it? - Uh... I don't know. - Please! I'll be your best friend. Well, I guess we could check it out. - All right, cool. - Hey, man. Any problems? - No, you? - No, nothing. - Hey, guys, wait for me! - Holy shit, what the hell? Why are you wearing a ninja costume? - 'Cause it was the only black I had. Also, why are you even here? I told you to wait in the house. - But... I just wanna do- - Okay, shh, be quiet. - It was my idea. I just wanted to- - Shut him up. Someone's gonna hear. - And I, and, and... - Okay, you can come in the car if you stop throwing a tantrum. - Thanks. Come on. Why are we stopping here? - Look, if you're gonna come along you gotta be quiet, okay? - But the molester's back there. - Hey, stupid. Do you really think we're gonna park right in front of his house and let him know we're just coming in? - Hm, I guess not. - Okay, so be ready when I get back? Yeah. All right. Um, what are you doing? Coming with you? No way. You're staying in the car. - Why? - Okay, Cory, get the car going. Let's go. - What? No, I'll stay in the car. I'll stay in the car. All right. Shit, shit. Come on. Front door. - Let's go, let's go! - What the shit, man? Let's go! What're you waiting for? Step the fuck on the gas! - What about Noel? - What? Where the hell is he? - Well, when I parked the car, he said that he was gonna help you and then he went off down the lane. - You're such an idiot. Why would you even let him go? Oh, if he... If I go back there, we're both totally screwed. Come on! Let's go, let's go! Come on, man! Get out of here! - That was so scary. Did you hear that girl screaming? - Uh, no. No, I didn't. Don't know what you're talking about. - I think she was being tortured. - Hm. - My numchucks. - What's your problem now? - I think I left my numchucks at the molester's house. - Why did you even bring those stupid things? - They're part of the costume. Oh, no! - Shh, be quiet! - Mum wrote my name on them. - Way to go, butthole. You're up shit creek now. - What am I supposed to do? - Just lock your windows and hope to god that the molester doesn't come and get ya. - Jason! - Look, there is no way I am going back to that house. I've done my one good deed for this year. I am done. - Please. Please, you gotta help me. - What do you want me to do? - I'm thinking we could go up there during recess. - I don't know. We could get in trouble. - Well, what if he finds them? I really need a lookout. I think we're okay. - So where'd you lose 'em? I can't remember. Damn it. - Noel! Noel! - Where'd you find them? - Over there. - Oh, I must've dropped them when I climbed the fence. Come on, faster! - We're late! Boys! Were either of you unaware that you are not allowed to leave the school grounds during recess? Oscar? - I don't know. What about you, Noel? What are the rules about staying on school property? - I don't know. - Look, this is serious. I've got half a mind to suspend the both of you. - No. You can't do that. Oh, yes, I can. And I will, unless I start getting some straight answers. So, what were you doing, then? You both wanna be suspended, is that it? - We had to go to the molester's house. - What? - I think we gotta tell him. What if those kids are still there? - What are you talking about? - The molester. The one that followed Cindy home last week. And took Kevin and Lisa. He lives on Cypress Street. - He what? How could you possibly know that? - Because the TV said so. - The TV said so? Okay, okay. Let's just, um, start from the beginning? When did you supposedly hear this? - Uh... Last week? - Last week? And what exactly did you hear on the TV? - Well... - It's a simple question. - Uh... - You don't remember the actual words you heard? - I guess I didn't really hear them. But Oscar did. He's the one that told us about it. - Oscar? Would you care to shed some light on the situation? - Come on. Tell him. - Your friend here seems to think that you heard something on the TV and I'd like you to tell me what that was. I've had about enough of this. When I ask you a question, I expect an honest answer. - It was nothing. - Just tell him what the news said about the molester living on Cypress. Is that what you told him? - Yes. And is that in fact what you heard on the TV? Well? - No. - What do you mean, no? - Did you hear anything at all about a "molester" living around here? - No. I just... I made all that up. - What? No, you didn't. - All right, then. You two can go back to your classes. I need to consider how we're going to handle what you did. Hey, Noel. Hey, Noel. Time for bed. Time for bed, sweetie. It's actually past your bedtime. There we go. Like a little bug. Goodnight. Mum? Yeah? - Why do people make things up when they don't have to? - Well... I guess there could be lots of reasons. - But are any of those good reasons? No. Probably not. - That's what I thought. - Are you okay? Is this about what happened at school today? - No. It's nothing. I was just wondering. Aww. Goodnight, munchkin. Goodnight. Sweet dreams.
