WAIT, MARTIN'S YOUR UNCLE? YEAH, YOU DUMBASS. HOW ELSE DO YOU THINK ERIN AND CHRIS GOT IT? AND QUIT DEFLECTING, OKAY? I KNOW YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY THE METH TYPE. NO, NOT REALLY. HOW DID YOU END UP HERE? MY ROOMMATE WAS DOING IT ON CAMPUS, AND MY MOM GOT SICK, AND HE OFFERED TO THROW SOME MONEY MY WAY IF I HELPED OUT. WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU SEEM REAL DIFFERENT THAN EVERYBODY ELSE AROUND HERE. YOU THINK I'M DIFFERENT? ANGRIER? WHAT? I'M NOT EVEN FROM HERE. MY FAMILY CAME FROM TEXAS. MY DAD GOT CANNED, SO MY UNCLE FOUND HIM SOME JOB, JUST OVER AT THE PAPER MILL IN ESCANABA SO... YEAH, THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP GROWING UP IN THIS FROZEN ARMPIT OF A TOWN. MY ROOMMATE WAS SMALL TIME, BUT HE WAS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY, YOU KNOW? THESE GUYS, THEY FOUND US, AND SAID THEY COULD BROKER A BIG SALE FOR US, AND THAT WOULD MEAN NO MORE SMALL TOWN DEALING TO COLLEGE KIDS. THAT MEANS ONE BIG SALE FOR A HUNDRED GS. I'M GUESSING THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT DOWN. THE DEAL WENT BAD. REALLY BAD. WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS NOW? UM... THEY'RE... THEY'RE GONE. THERE WAS A LEAK IN THE GAS HEATER IN OUR LITTLE TRAILER. WOW. I'M REALLY SORRY. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA FUCKING DO, RIGHT? I JUST DIDN'T WANNA GET STUCK HERE. YOU KNOW? NOT LIKE OUR PARENTS DID. WE HAD THESE PLANS AND... WE WERE GONNA GET OUT. CHRIS WANTED TO OPEN THIS BAGEL SHOP BECAUSE, I DON'T KNOW, THE BOY JUST LOVED BAGELS. AND I DIDN'T REALLY CARE WHERE WE WENT. YOU KNOW, I JUST WANTED TO END UP SOMEWHERE WARM. MY IDIOT ROOMMATE DECIDED TO MAKE THE DEAL IN OUR APARTMENT. AND WHEN I GOT BACK FROM CLASS, I FOUND HIM DEAD, WEDGED UP AGAINST THE DOOR LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO LOCK SOMEBODY IN. THEN SOMEBODY STARTED SHOOTING AT ME THROUGH THE DOOR, AND... I RAN. I GRABBED HIS KEYS, I JUST WENT TO HIS STUPID CONVERTIBLE, AND... I JUST DROVE, MAN. I DROVE AND DROVE. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THEN I REALIZED I HAD THE MONEY IN THE CAR WITH ME. WAIT, YOU'VE GOT... YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED GRAND JUST SITTING AROUND? NO, I SENT MOST OF THE MONEY TO MY MOM, GOT HER SET UP IN A CANCER CLINIC IN TAMPA UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME. SHE'S DOING... SHE'S DOING BETTER NOW. SOUNDS LIKE AT LEAST SOMETHING GOOD CAME OUT OF IT, RIGHT? WHEN I WAS A KID, I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY OUTSTANDING THAT YOU COULD SEE YOUR OWN BREATH. I MEAN, I KNOW NOW THAT IT'S JUST WATER VAPOR CONDENSING IN THE AIR, MAKING LITTLE RAIN CLOUDS AS IT CHANGES FROM GAS TO LIQUID, BUT I ALWAYS FELT LIKE I WAS SOME SORT OF DRAGON BOY... BREATHING SMOKE AND FIRE. CHECK IT OUT. A BABY'S FOOT. OH... WELL, LOOK WHAT WE GOT HERE. NORTH, MY FRIEND. WE GO NORTH. YOU'RE MAKING IT TOO DAMN BIG! WHAT? JUST STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU GONNA DROP A DEAD BODY THROUGH THERE? SORRY, I FIGURED, BIGGER HOLE, MORE FISH. YEAH, YEAH, MORE FISH. SO YOU'RE SEEING MY NIECE THERE, HUH? YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT, TOO, EH? SMALL TOWN, IDIOT. WELL, YEAH, OFF AND ON. AND THAT APRIL GIRL? LOOK, I DIDN'T PLAN FOR THIS, OKAY? MADISON TURNED ME DOWN, AND APRIL WAS JUST REALLY NICE ABOUT THINGS. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I WAS YOUNG MYSELF AND NEW IN TOWN ONCE. IT'S COLDER THAN HELL UP HERE, AND I IMAGINE I WARMED UP WITH MOST OF THE GIRLS IN TOWN IN MY DAY. THE WARMEST PLACE I KNOW, BETWEEN A WOMAN'S THIGHS. YEAH. I DON'T KNOW WHY KIDS NOWADAYS ALL RUSH INTO MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIPS SO DAMN QUICK ANYWAY. BACK IN THE '60S, EVERYONE WAS SLEEPING WITH EVERYONE ALL THE TIME. I WONDER WHY THAT CHANGED. I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS AIDS. OH. - HUH. - YEAH. OH. OH! SORRY, I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE. CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING? COFFEE? OH, NO, NO. THANKS, MISS, NO. I'M AGENT HOLDEN CAULFIELD. THIS IS MY PARTNER... STEVE, AND WE'RE FROM THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, AND WE'RE JUST LOOKING TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS... AND CHECK OUT ONE OF THESE DELICIOUS-LOOKING PASTRIES. - OOH. - OH. OH, NO, THEY'RE PASTIES, ACTUALLY. MM-HM. WOW, THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. YEAH. YEAH, ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP. GREAT. IS THAT KOOL-AID? WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE SOURCE OF THIS RED METHAMPHETAMINE. OH, THAT'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. YES, MAYBE YOU COULD POINT US IN THE LIKELY DIRECTION. WELL, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO START, I WOULD TRY ON THE NORTH SIDE OF TOWN BECAUSE THERE ARE A FEW UNSAVORY TYPES ON THAT SIDE OF TOWN. SO, GREAT, THANK YOU, THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL, BUT I WAS HOPING MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE US SOME NAMES. OH, RIGHT, YEAH. YEAH, UM, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK I KNOW A PERSON LIKE THAT. SO SORRY ABOUT THAT. BUT I BET YOU SHE WOULD, IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT THERE. - ERIN. - WHOA, HOMES! YOU CAN'T JUST SNEAK UP ON A SISTER LIKE THAT. I SPILLED SO MUCH POPCORN. DAMN, WILL YOU SHUT UP ALREADY? LISTEN TO ME.

ONCE YOU'RE THERE, LET THEM SEE YOU GO INSIDE, THEN SNEAK OUT THE BACK TO MARTIN'S SHACK AND I'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE. YOU GOT ALL THAT? YEAH, YEAH, DRIVE TO THE SHACK IN 20 MINUTES. AND THEN SNEAK OUT THE BACK TO MARTIN'S. OKAY, GOOD. IF WE JUST BE COOL, WE BOTH SHOULD MAKE IT THROUGH THIS. YO, WHAT DID YOU DO TO THESE MOTHERFUCKERS TO MAKE THEM SO MAD AT YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE? THEY... THEY THINK I STOLE SOMETHING FROM THEM. DID YOU? NO. OKAY, MAYBE. ALL RIGHT, IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED, ALL RIGHT? I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO YOU LATER. FUCK. YOU GOT IT? - OKAY. - OKAY.

I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO COOK METH. UNTIL I GOT HERE, THE WORST THING I'D EVER DONE, WAS STEAL A SCALE FROM THE LAB. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T GET IT. MY ROOMMATE WAS THE COOK. ALL I EVER DID WAS BORROW EQUIPMENT FROM THE SCHOOL CAMPUS LAB. HELL, I WAS EVEN PLANNING ON RETURNING THAT. SO WHERE DID ALL THE METH COME FROM, THEN? HUH? AFTER THEY CAUGHT UP TO ME THE FIRST TIME, I KNEW I'D NEVER REALLY BE ABLE TO OUTRUN THEM. I COULD NEVER HAVE A LIFE IF THEY KNEW I WAS STILL OUT THERE. SO I STARTED SELLING THE STOCKPILE OF METH I HAD WHEN I RAN. I WANTED THEM TO FIND ME, SO I COULD LURE THEM IN AND TRY TO FAKE MY OWN DEATH. YEAH, WELL, THAT WAS PRETTY STUPID, AND IT DIDN'T WORK, SO YOU GOTTA GET OVER IT 'CAUSE WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH... WE CAN'T.

WELL, MY FIRST CHOICE WAS STUBBORNLY UNAVAILABLE. GO OUT THE BACK DOOR, HIDE IN THE OTHER SHACK. - I'M GONNA TRY AND HOLD THEM OFF. - NO, NO, NO. - I'M NOT JUST GONNA LEAVE... - PLEASE! JUST LISTEN TO ME, DON'T ARGUE WITH ME. FORGET ABOUT THE GIRL. JUST WATCH THE DOOR IN CASE HE TRIES TO SNEAK PAST ME. YOU REALLY SHOULD'VE KEPT RUNNING. YOU CAN'T RUN FROM YOUR PROBLEMS FOREVER, EH? WHAT? FUCK! OH, MY... NO! OH, MY GOD! THAT WAS YOUR FUCKING PLAN? IT WASN'T MY FIRST PLAN, BUT IT WORKED. NOT IF WE FREEZE TO DEATH, YOU ASSHOLE. LET'S GO. WE CAN'T DIE OUT HERE. NO, NO! NO! OH, JEEZ. HEY. HEY. HEY, HOW ARE WE NOT ARRESTED? MARTIN COVERED FOR US. HE SAID WE WERE OUT FISHING IN HIS SHACK AND... THAT THE ICE MUST'VE BLEW AND YOU MUST'VE FELL IN. HOW ARE YOU... HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP? I'M FINE. HOW'S THE BABY? IS IT OKAY? MADDY, I'M... I'M REALLY SORRY. OH, GOD. IT STARTED UP WHEN WE FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT. THAT'S THE WHOLE REASON CHRIS STARTED COOKING IN THE FIRST PLACE... BECAUSE HE WANTED US TO HAVE MORE MONEY FOR THE BABY. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. ALL RIGHT? I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING SERIOUS. HOW'D YOU LEARN TO MAKE A BOMB ANYWAY? I LOOKED IT UP ON THE INTERNET.
