(chimes ringing) (percussive exotic music) (crickets chirping) (car creaking) (man and woman moaning) - What was that? - What? - There was this fantastic flood of light and warmth. - I think that's called an orgasm, baby. - You wish. (woman giggling) (birds chirping) (chanting in foreign language in background) - Bahai Guru Sachepacha, you know what is best but we have suffered enough. If you can find it in your heart to set us free from this curse and deliver me a son, I will be forever grateful. (tinkling) - Oh, good morning, beta. - Good morning, papa. - [Mom] Don't go anywhere. I'm nearly finished. - I'm late for class. - Wait, I have something for you. Happy birthday, beta. (clinking) - [Daughter] An old jhanjar? - That's not just any old jhanjar. It's the one you used to wear as a child in India. Your grandmother kept it for you all these years to give to you on your 19th birthday. - I wore this? - Yes. Here you are. And standing right next to you is your future husband. Isn't he handsome? He has the other jhanjar. And when both of you get together again, the set will be complete just like the two of you. - I think I'm gonna puke. - Wait, don't forget this. - What's this? - It arrived yesterday. Let me read it to you. - I'm late. - But aren't you curious? (sneezing) (gasping) You just sneezed. Sit down. - [Daughter] Mother! - Sit. Wait till the bad luck passes. Oh it's a terrible month. There's supposed to be an eclipse. Ay, guru. - I don't have time for this primitive shit. - Primitive shit, (speaking in foreign language) You come straight home from school. Sensational Saris is having its annual Diwali sale. - I thought you said the bad luck had passed. I'm sorry, Rumi, I forgot. There's a law against this sort of thing. You could get arrested. - We're just trying to get a look at Count Dracula. - Shh! - Count Dracula? - You're such a suck! - Who's Count Dracula? - The freak that lives down here. Have you ever seen him? - [Kid] He lives in the suite next to us and we've never seen him. - Maybe he likes his privacy. - Oh, shit burgers! There's old lady Cheema! Run before she turns you into a toad! - Hello auntie Chee. - I'm glad I caught you before you left. Come. Oh, thank you. Oh, it's useless. My arthritis is getting so bad. You'll have to do it, dear. Thank you. Never mind those, come. Come, come, come. I have to give you a reading. - It's okay, aunty Chee, I don't really believe in this. - I promised your grandmother I'll give you a reading on your 19th birthday. Come and sit. (clock ticking) My dear child. You're burdened with an overwhelming destiny. - Where? - See this is your lifeline. It has so many little chains in it. These are obstacles. - Those are just toast crumbs from this morning. - There's an eclipse around the corner. You might feel unfamiliar sensations. - I'm not gonna go howling at the moon, am I? (laughing) Come to think of it, I have been feeling a little strange lately. - [Cheema] Strange, how? - It's hard to describe. It's kind of like this tingling throughout my whole body. Like when your hand falls asleep. - You are carrying the light, my dear. The universe has initiated you. - Initiated me for what? - Wait and see. Let the celestial sisters guide you. The number three is very significant. - Holy shit, did you see that? - [Cheema] What? - The flower! - [Cheema] What about it? - Wasn't it? Never mind. (chimes ringing) (percussive song in foreign language) (clapping and giggling) - Wow, you really outdid yourself on that one. - Yeah well I thought Gugan might enjoy a traditional happy birthday dance. - We should change your name to Kelly Bindur. (laughing) - Ethnicity is a state of mind. - Yeah well you're out of yours. Where's that damn clinking noise coming from? - Oh, they're my new ankle bracelets. They have bells on them. Only a buck at the Punjabi market, ladies. - Hope you got change back. - They're chungers. - [Jessie] We know what they are. We're the Indians, remember? - What's this? A love letter from Arjan. - That'll be the day. - Oh my god, is that? You're 19 today. - [Jessie] Yeah, so? - Can I tell them? - I don't care. Everyone's gonna know sooner or later. - Know what? - Gugan's grandmother has promised her hand in marriage to some guy in India. - No way. - Isn't that so romantic? - You nuts? It's purely obligation. - Obligation, yeah right. When have you done anything out of obligation? - It's complicated. (car honks) - Does Arjan know? (hip hop music) - You getting out? - Sorry, can't stay. Well maybe for a quick birthday toast. Oh come on man. You gotta loosen up that turban. I think it's cutting off the circulation to your brain. - One day your father is gonna figure out who's watering down the supply. - I've got a foolproof system. Besides, it's my duty as a loving daughter. Full strength could kill him. - I wanna stay real. Just like in the commercial. - What's so great about reality, man? - You should visit us sometime. - Shit, that's Jarinder. - Hey baby. While you're down there. Ow! - It's okay, she's gone. - She's so straight. She'll go right to her parents and tell. Next thing you know, her mother will be babbling it all over the Gurdwara. - And here I thought people at the Gurdwara would be closer to god. - If you wanna be closer to God you should have a toke of this stuff. You could have a cup of chai with him. - Here, I didn't have time to wrap it. Happy birthday. - The young person's guide to the Sikh religion. Oh, that's so sweet. - It's pretty good. See here it's written specially for young people who've sort of lost faith in the culture. - Great. I'll have to read it after midterms. - Well I got you something too. - You did? - Sure. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it. It's sort of for people who've lost faith in their culture too. - Are you coming? Hey! The party's probably over by now. I don't know what you see in that guy. - It's easy. Neither of us have any expectations. - Have you ever heard the saying "If the milk was free, no one will buy the cow"? - Have you ever heard the saying "I just sold my cow so I don't need your bull"? - Look I know it's none of my business but why are you wasting your time with that guy? - What do you mean? - When the time comes, how are you gonna pitch him to your parents? - What? What makes you think I wanna marry him? - Well you're sleeping with him. I mean Indian girls don't usually, you know. - Fuck? - Don't say it. - Oh I'll never understand Indian men. They don't want their women to be sexual yet they can't wait to get into their pants. Freud would have a heyday with you guys. - Yeah. And Romeo there is above all that. - At least he's not hung up on the whole Madonna whore shit. - No, he's just a poster boy for your brain on drugs. And besides he's not even of your caste. - I can't believe you said that. - What? - The caste thing. - He's not your caste. - It's just amazing. Indian people are so intolerant. When they can't find another race to discriminate against, they start discriminating against their own. - The guy gave you drugs for your birthday. What's he gonna give you for Christmas, a grow op? He's an asshole who doesn't give a shit about you. - Thanks for your concern but I can take care of myself. (sighs) (chimes ringing) - Excuse me. May I trouble you to throw me my towel? I think it's over there. You may want to avert your eyes. I do my laps in the buff. - Or I might not. - Suit yourself. I don't usually get any spectators this time of day. Are you with the birthday bash? Happy birthday. - How do you know it's my birthday? - 'Cause you look very introspective. - Do you make a habit of going skinny dipping in the freezing ocean? - Only when there's a beautiful lady around to watch. - Why is it that an English accent can make even the corniest old lines sound intelligent? - [Kelly] Gugan! - I think your friends are looking for you. - What did you say your name was? - I didn't. (light music) - It's really quite exquisite, isn't it? Are you all right, beta? You're looking a little pale lately. - I'm fine. - Then you could show a little bit more excitement. After all, you are a bride to be. - I agreed to go through with it, mother. But no one said I had to be excited about it. - Gugan, you know we have your best interest at heart. They're a well-to-do family. He's educated and attractive. - Spare me the sales pitch because you're feeling guilty. I said I'd do it. But you and I both know why I'm in this situation. - Look, they're a kind-hearted family. If it wasn't for them, Ruman wouldn't be alive today. And your grandmother-- (clacking) - Shh, shh, shh. - [Mom] He only seems to listen to you. - Maybe because I've always accepted him for who he really is. - Oh Gugan, try to understand. It's different in India. If only I could take back that wretched night. (energetic Bollywood music) (singing in foreign language) (giggling) - I'm done, let's go. - Oh no, no, no, you can't do that. Oh god those colors are much too drab for the parade. - Who's idea was it to bring her anyways? - Ooh, somebody call them PG, do you have something in-- - I can't believe you're actually thinking about going through with this. Why don't you just say no? - It's a long story. There were complications when Ruman was born. These people saved his life and the only request they made was I marry their only son. - Pretty big request. - Come on, you guys, let's try them on. - What? - Oh, it'll be fun, you'll see. - So now you have to marry a stranger? - Why don't you just say no? I mean they're in India. It's not like they're gonna come looking for you. - My grandmother was really traditional. - Yeah, well whose isn't? - She made me promise on her deathbed that I would honor the agreement. - Those old boories are so sneaky. They always wait till they're on their deathbed. I mean who's gonna say no to a dying old boory? (laughs) Besides Jessie. - Come on you guys, let's go. - Wait a minute guys. I have no idea how to put this thing on. - [Everyone] Who does? - Oh you guys are so pitiful. Have you no sense of your own culture? - You should talk. Look at you with the bangles and the bindhi. Shouldn't you be wearing something green with shamrocks on it? - [Kelly] Mmm, too boring. Now your culture, fascinating. - You're just romanticizing it. - I'd say forget it. The old lady's dead. It's not like she'll ever know. - It's not that simple. My mother's convinced we're under some kind of curse. And if I break the agreement something terrible will happen. - Something terrible is gonna happen. You're gonna end up marrying some freshie from India with a turban. - Besides, you don't know anything about this guy. I mean he could be an alcoholic or a wife beater. - Or worse, he could be shitty in bed. (giggling) - I look like a majarani! - You look like white bread dressed up as whole wheat. Now I, I look hot. - I think I'm gonna take this one. What about you, Gugan, which one did you choose? - I'm not sure. - The pink. Definitely the pink. (light music) - Where is that man? Are you listening? - He's gone out for a few minutes. Said he'll be back after lunch. - We just opened. No sooner does he get here then he's out the back door. We've got to decide on the float for the parade, order the decorations. - What's the big deal? It's not exactly busy in here. - I'm the one who works my fingers to the bone to feed you and keep a roof over your head. He just comes and goes as he pleases. - Mom, do you mind? That stuff stinks. - Look, prenti. This is a sacred ritual, have some respect. - It stings my eyes! - It'll help bring us happiness and prosperity and protect us from bad luck during the eclipse. - It's an incense burner, not a genie. - You don't know anything about your religion. If you ever went to the Gurdwara you'd understand. - Like I said before, God has left that building. - One day that blasphemous tongue of yours will get you into trouble. - If there was a God, he would have struck me down a long time ago. - Maybe he's waiting for a clear shot. - Oh if business doesn't pick up I don't know how I'm gonna marry off two daughters. It would have been so much easier if you were boys. Child, go find your father. - Mom, do I have to? - No, you don't have to. You could stay here and mop the floors, wipe down the trays, fill in the sugar dispensers. - [Sister] Okay, okay, I'm going. (chime ringing) - What's the matter with you? You look like you've seen a ghost. (zooming) (melancholy music) - [Nurse] Gugan Dhaliwal? (speaking in foreign language) - Hi. - I see you've figured out the gown. Some of my East Indian patients find it rather puzzling. - Seems straightforward enough. - Well you'd be surprised the number of times I've come in here and found a pair of grass poking through the armholes. Now what can I do for you today? - I think, actually I'm sure I'm pregnant. - Oh I see. And you want to know the sex. - No. - [Doctor] You don't want to know the sex? - Is that so surprising? - No, most of my patients don't come over the line unless they're concerned about the sex of their fetus. You know you can get a therapeutic abortion in Canada, it's legal. - I realize that. It's a question of privacy. - Oh I see. Well, first thing we need to do is an ultrasound to date the fetus. Now this is going to be a little cold. Hang on. (machine beeping) Right. There we are. Well I'll be damned. - What, is there something wrong? - No, no let me just check on something. If this is what I think it is, it's very rare. It's remarkable. - Is everything all right? - [Doctor] Well look, see for yourself. - What? Are those twins? - Oh no, not twins, my dear. Triplets. Very rare indeed. - Holy shit, three? Are you sure? Three. - You see the three little sacs there with the three little hearts beating, huh? Oh, not a looly on any of them I'm sorry to say. - A what? - A looly. Isn't that the Punjabi word for penis? - The light is growing stronger. But embrace it. Everything will work out. You wait and see. When you touched my wrist the other day I felt a strange tingling sensation. My arthritis hasn't bothered me since. - That's good news. - Drink it. I put some ginger in it to help with the nausea. You're having nausea, aren't you? - The nausea I can handle. It's the fricking spook show I'm having a problem with. - You have the gift just like your grandmother did. - A bouquet of roses or a box of chocolates is a gift. Losing your mind is not. - It is because the eclipse is very close to Diwali this year. - What does that mean? - There are opposing forces at work. The absence of light and the celebration of light. Everything is aligning itself to the way it should be. You are, or they are channeling the light. - The light? - Diwali's a time of spiritual renewal. A time to shine light on the dark forces in our lives. You have been blessed to carry the light. It's a great honor bestowed only on people worthy of it. - I don't want to be worthy of it. I just wanna have fun. - It only works through people who are pure to restore balance in our lives. - Well then there's definitely been a mistake. I'm far from pure. - I mean pure of heart, love. (birds chirping) - You're spending too much time with that old lady. - I thought you'd be happy. She's very spiritual. - She's not spiritual, she's primitive. She does not pray to God. - Just because she doesn't treat God like a vending machine doesn't mean she's primitive. - (speaking in foreign language) The babas will be here soon, we need to prepare. (exotic music in foreign language) - Who are they? These guys are real babas? Get over here! Get over the fence. (humming) - Whoah! She just gave them a wad of money just for a drink of water! - Whoah. - Ruman! (shattering) (man groaning) (man singing in foreign language) - I told you a hundred times to keep this door closed. The entire house smells of booze. - I take it you're not going to need my stud services this week, eh? - Have you no shame talking about our private matters? - I'm ready when you are. - Are you drunk already? Where's the bottle? - You go mind your own business. - We've got company over. - So what? I'll share. - You old fool. Just you stay in this room tonight. Those people could be our future in-laws. - Ah, they should be so lucky. - Oh, good you're home. Let me put these away and change into a nice sevar chemise. I've got a good feeling about this family. The boy is an engineer. Same caste, what more can you want? - Mmm, that is good looking and has a hot bod? - Oh, hot bod is not important. The most important thing is that he comes from a good family and he has good earning potential. Now when you come out to serve the chai don't look them straight in the eye, hmm? Be shy, reserved. Just look down at their feet. - How am I supposed to see if he's hot if I'm looking down at his feet? - Oh, you're supposed to steal a glimpse not outward gawk. - We should develop some kind of signal in case I don't like him. - Don't be silly, he's an engineer. You can learn to like an engineer. - So where'd you meet these people anyways? - I didn't exactly meet them. - What? - So, what's going on? - Prospective young man and his family are coming over to meet Pria. - What, are you nuts? You let her set this up? - She wouldn't let it go. - So who's this guy? - An engineer. - What does he look like? - Looks are not important. - You know that actually means he's, (choking) - Oho, look, they'll be here any moment now. Go and put something other than those. Don't you girls own anything other than torn jeans? - Why do I have to go change? They're not coming to check me out. - The whole family is on display. - Whatever. I refuse to put on that clown suit. Engineers, engineer. It's them, they're here! - Are you sure it's them? - Yup, I saw the Kleenex. - What? - Every Hindu car has a box of Kleenex from 1975. It sits in the back tray and slides around. It's a trademark. - Jah, go get changed. Pria, you go to the kitchen. Serve the chai in about 10 minutes. And remember what I said. Don't stare at him. - Why can't she look at him? - Because he might find it intimidating. - Only if he's a baboon. - Go. You go to the bedroom, take care of your papa. - I take it you got thrown out too, huh? Damn woman. - (speaking in foreign language) Welcome, welcome. Come in, come in. - Thank you. - Where is the girl's father? - He's sick with the flu. He came in from work and went straight to bed. - Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Where does he work? - We have a sweet shop in the market. It's been so busy. So, Arjan, you're an engineer? - Actually I'm studying to be one. - Oh, you're still at school. - That's quite an ambitious undertaking. - This is one of your daughters? - She's the older one. She's also at school. - So what kind of engineering are you in? - What do you mean? - You know, civil, electrical, metallurgical. I bet you're in the chemical. - Just the basic type. - The basic type? Honey, I never heard of the basic type. What exactly does it involve? - What about your other daughter? What does she do? - Oh, Pria helps out in the shop. You know it's so busy, we couldn't manage without her. - Do you have any other children? - The girls have a brother. - Oh, where is he? - He's also not well. Is Arjan your only son? - He has two brothers. He's the youngest of three. He's a good boy, doesn't smoke, drink, or stay out late. - I think I'll go help with the chai. - [Mom] This is my other daughter, Pria. - You look very familiar. I think I've seen you around the school parking lot. You're always visiting that white woman who lives in the trailer with the five kids? - No, no, you must have him mixed up with someone else. - No, no, you drive the orange Chevy with the fuzzy white seats, right? Funny, I always thought you were married to that woman. The littlest one with the runny nose, looks exactly like you. - No, no. You must be mistaken. (speaking in foreign language) - You shouldn't be out of bed, hmm? - And miss the chance to meet these wonderful people? - You really should go back to bed. - Nah, nah, nah, nonsense. - [Mom] It's the fever. It's still quite high. - How about a drink? Gugan, get out a couple of glasses. Hey, this must be the outstanding young man. Why don't the two of you go for a little walk? Have some fun, here. - I think we should be going now. - Which village did you say you're from? - Ladpur. - Ladpur, that is very close to our place. We are from Lashipu. We are practically neighbors! - What's your family name? - Kentra. - Kentra? I see. - It's getting late. We should go. - But I'm... (grunting) - Thanks a lot. - Me, you're the one shopping around for the virgin. - No expectations, remember? Your words, not mine. - Yeah well you'll be much happier with some Indian virgin who worships the very ground you walk on anyway. By the way, nice hair. - (speaking in foreign language) I hope the neighbors didn't see. I knew it would be bad luck doing it so close to the eclipse. (snoring) - So Pria, what did you think? You wanna marry him? - Don't even joke about it. - What? - Our dear mother just about had you engaged to an untouchable. - Ah, what, ew, gross. - Oh Gugan, go boil these dishes. - Mom, they're people just like you and me. And you call yourself spiritual. Even Jesus was nice to the lepers. - Jesus was white, what did he know? - If that wasn't the most embarrassing one yet. - You have no idea. - We can never have these people as our in-laws. - They weren't that bad. - Are you kidding? That was the worst drink I've ever had in my life. 90 percent water. (spitting) cheap son of a bitch. - How I supposed to know they're lying about their caste? No one lies about their caste. There's no point. Why they would write that they are Jat in the ad is beyond me. - Wait a minute, is the ad in English? - Of course. - Well that explains it. - Explains nothing, you think I can't read English? - Mother, being able to read discount sale or no tax is a far cry from being able to read English. Let me see. - Look, right here. Wanted, nice Punjabi girl for sure engineer. No calls if no Jat caste. - Wanted, nice Punjabi girl for future engineer. No calls if no just cause. - Just cause, mother, not Jat caste, big difference. - I'm surprised she was even able to make out engineer. - Engineer, doctor, lawyer, that's just another word for money. Every Indian mother understands that. (laughing) (clacking) - But soft, what light through yonder window breaks! - Are you mad? My father will kill you if he finds you here. - Deny thy father. - Ah, that's my line, Romeo. (grunting) - [Man] Now we know why Juliet had a balcony. - This is nuts, I don't even know your name. - What's in a name? Will a rose not smell as sweet known by any other name? - Knock it off. If anyone sees you here, I'm dead. What do you want? - I waited for you. I'm booked to fly out tomorrow. I had to see you before I left. Tell me you're not feeling this intense connection and I'll go. - I'm not feeling this intense conn-- (light music) Okay look. Things are really complicated. - They're only as complicated as you choose to make them. - Trust me, they're complicated. - Tell me you're not feeling what I'm feeling. - In another time and place, if things were different. - Come with me. - What, I hardly know you. - Well we can fix that. The best delivery is but sick and green and none but fools do have. Cast it off. (chimes ringing) (energetic music) - Make sure no one sees you. - My plane leaves 7:30 tomorrow night. - This is ludicrous. I don't even know your name. - Raymond. - Pleased to meet you, Raymond. - Come with me. - I can't. - Don't deny your feelings. Feels right, doesn't it? - I don't know what feels right anymore. I just introduced myself to a guy I just slept with. - Well then, we'll have to make an honest woman out of you. Marry me. - Yeah right. Look, it's been fun. But my life is really complicated. - It's only as complicated as you want to make it. - Okay, wise guy. Uncomplicate this. - Hey, don't worry about it. I've got one too. I quite fancy a bit of pop. You know all of the Indian goddesses have pot bellies. It's kind of sexy. - Was Romeo this thick? It's not a pot belly, you idiot. I'm pregnant. - That was quick. - With triplets. - Okay, minor setback. - All girls. - Wow. Triplet girls. Who did you piss off? - Goodbye. - Not so fast. You're not gonna get rid of me yet. You know nothing is really as bad as it seems. The past is history. Tomorrow's a mystery. Today is a gift. That's why it's called the present. - I just told you I'm pregnant with triplets and you act like I'm talking about the weather? - I can deal with it. - I am pregnant with another man's sperm, and you're acting like-- - Okay, I get it. I don't need a picture. - Aha, so now you're reacting honestly. - We all have our stuff. - You mean baggage. - Whatever. We all come with it. - What's your baggage? - Let's just say one man's baggage is another man's treasure. - You talk in riddles and I still don't know anything about you. - That's not true. You know I'd drink poison just to be with you. - You have to be careful, Rami. Not all that glitters is gold. (light music) - [Doctor] Hmm. What now? Let me guess. They're holding up pro-life signs. - Everything's just fine. - What's that? - [Doctor] What's what? - That strange cloud-like thing around their heads. It looks like a halo. - They all have halos in there. Wait till you get them home. You can get dressed now. The receptionist will explain to you the procedures when you fill out the forms. Although ultrasound is a reliable method, we can't guarantee its accuracy 100%. Gender mistakes, although very rare can occur. - Gender mistakes. - Miss? What about the second half of your appointment? Do you wanna book it for another time? - Not right now. - Are you sure? We get quite busy here and you don't have much time. - It's okay. If I get really desperate I have a coat hanger in the car. (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello, can I speak to Arjan please? - Just a minute. Arjan, telephone! - Hello? - I need to see you. - What are you nuts, calling me at home? - I got tired of leaving messages on your cell. - [Arjan] I've been busy. - I just bet you have. - [Arjan] I gotta go. - Wait, I have to see you. Consolation point, seven o'clock. - Why, so you can finish me off? - Fine, then I'll just show up on your doorstep and talk to your dear mother about what her precious son has been up to while she's been out looking for a nice Indian girlfriend to marry. - I gotta go. - I'm pregnant. - Shit! - With triplets. - Triple shit. All right, my boys can swim. - [Gugan] Actually, they're girls. (slamming) - Okay, bye John. - How could you? Isn't it enough that this house is cursed already? (speaking in foreign language) Your grandmother made a vow. We can't back out. - She had no right. - No right? (speaking in foreign language) she was your grandmother! If your own grandmother doesn't have the right, who does? Maybe it's a mistake. Are you absolutely sure? - I'm sure. - Then we have to take care of it before anyone finds out. - I can't take care of it that way. - I know how you're feeling, beta. But it's the right thing to do. You're young. You have your whole life ahead of you. Why do you want to risk all that, huh? Trust me. Before long you won't even think about it anymore. - You don't really believe that, mother. - You don't understand about the effect this will have on the future. This mistake will destroy this family. Are you selfish enough to ruin your sister's life as well? Tell me. Who's gonna marry the sister of a pregnant randi? - [Pria] Mom! - Isn't it bad enough that she has a drunk for a father and a mute brother? - It wouldn't be that way if you hadn't tried to rip him out! - [Pria] Mom, what is she talking about? - Tell her, mother! Tell her how you thought Ruman was a girl and how you tried to get some old crone from the village to take care of it for you! - You were young. You know nothing about tradition. - Tradition? It's got nothing to do with tradition. It's prejudice, pure and simple. - You wait until they whisper behind your back about your filthy untouchable children. Our people will never let you forget. - Your people, not mine. I'm not like you! - Gugan! - You're right. I'm not like you. I have values and respect for my family. - How do you even know what your values are? You inherited them like some disease! - So, you'll sacrifice your family and reputation. I have nothing more to say to you. - [Pria] Mom! - She's made her choice. When I come home from work I don't want to see her face anymore. - Mother, no! Gugan, papa won't let you do this. He won't let you do this! Papa! - Fine, I'll leave. - [Mom] Do as you please. (Ruman growling) - Where will you go? - Not sure, maybe Kelly's. - Gugan. Have you even thought about this? What about school? And what makes you think that Arjan's gonna be happy about this? - It's not about Arjan. - Well he's the father, isn't he? - Does it matter? - Mom is only trying to do what's best for you. - No, she's trying to do what's best for her. - Oh come on. You don't really believe that. - She almost aborted Ruman because she thought he was a girl. I sat in the doctor's office and did almost exactly the same thing. Pria, someone's gotta put an end to this bullshit. - Just because you do, doesn't mean anybody else will. They'll still want boys. You can't change our religion! - It's not about religion! It's the Indian culture that has to change! It's hard to explain, Pria. It's like someone is sending me signs. - What? - It's like I've been given this responsibility to right the wrong. - Okay now you're starting to freak me out. - Change has to start somewhere. - Why here? Why not let somebody else start it and suffer? You're gonna end up a single mom out on the streets without any support! - What about them, Pria? Our mother couldn't stand the thought of people looking down at her because she had three daughters and not a single son. Do you want your daughters to go through that? - Your daughters are gonna be untouchables, do you want them to go through that? - No. That's why I'm doing this. (sobbing) You might as well take this. I won't be needing it. - Papa, tell her not to go. Papa! (sobbing) (somber music) - There they are. - Magic water! - All right! - I don't know, you guys. Doesn't look very safe to drink. - Sure it is. Who's ever heard of unsafe magic water? - What's all that stuff floating around in it? - Where? Oh yeah. We'll have to charge extra for that. (kids shouting in distance) - Not a single match. Why do I even bother? Gugan Dhaliwal. Should start charging rent now that she's getting her mail here. - Oh hey mom, you're up early. Didn't you work the night shift? Mom, you're drinking? We just got up. - Oh who can sleep with those darn brats always up to no good. - I think it's cute. They're selling magic water. - Magic water. I bet it's dope. - What's this? - Oh your friend's receiving her mail here now. - Hmm, looks funny, it's not postmarked. - [Mom] Yeah it must have been delivered. The whole neighborhood knows she's living here. - It doesn't say who it's from, that's strange. - What's strange? - [Mom] Oh, there's a package for you. No note or anything. - For me? - I mean, do you think it's safe? - What? - Well you didn't exactly leave on good terms. - Oh good point. Is it tickin? - No. Sure smells good. - Give me that. - [Mom] Ooh, what are those? - [Gugan] Ludoos. - What? - Ludoos. Oh, I love those things, they're so good. But aren't they usually yellow? - Yeah. Oh they're the traditional sweet of celebration. Usually when a son is born, the family gives out ludoos to show their gratitude. - And what if a little girl is born, what do they hand out then? - A box of Kleenex. - These ones are pink though. I mean do you think that-- - While you two argue over the color I'm gonna have one. - Mom, no! Are you sure you wanna eat one of those? - You think someone's trying to poison us with pink sweet balls? Even the IRA wouldn't stoop that low. And besides, poison isn't exactly the Indo-Candian weapon of choice, now is it? It's not dramatic enough. No they usually prefer semi-automatics, knives, vise grips and pizza ovens. Isn't that right, Gugen? - Don't mind her. She didn't get enough sleep. - I'm sorry dear, I didn't mean anything by it. You know you're like a daughter to me. And if you dye your hair red I'd have my Irish daughter back. - Mom, I really think you should get some rest now. - Good plan. You will check on me just in case. - Yup. God, this has gotta be Arjan. It's gotta be his way of making up. - Oh, I forgot to pick my numbers. Gugen, come here. I need to rub your belly for luck. - What? - Oh mom's got these weird good luck rituals. - [Gugan] That tickles. - Okay, you girls in there, do your thing, make me a winner. Or your mom will have to find another place to live. - [Kelly] Do you think it was Arjan? - No, I told you, Arjan was at my place checking out my sister. God knows how many girls he's got on the go. - What an asshole. - Besides, it could be anybody. Everyone's talking about it. So I'm kinda looking forward to it. It should be interesting. But anyway. You know what, I'll catch up with you later okay? See ya. Hey! I may be pregnant but I can still outrun your sorry ass. If I didn't know better I think you're avoiding me. - No, it's just. - [Gugan] Just what? - I don't know. Everything is different now. - In what way? - You must have had some idea how I felt about you. - And now your feelings for me have changed because I'm damaged goods? - No. Okay yes, but not because you're pregnant. I just realize how different we are. - We're not that different. It's just we both know what we don't want. - It's been like that all day. People walking away with little jars of water. God in a glass. - People are so gullible. - Don't be too quick to judge, my dear. The power of belief can work miracles especially during this phase of the moon. - Hey, Gugan, want some of our magic potion? You'll have a boy, guaranteed! - I'll pass. - Oh, come on. There might not be any left. Jaskren went home to get his dog. She's gonna have puppies. And he wants to make sure they're all boys. - Oh, I almost forgot to congratulate you on your sister's upcoming wedding. - Can I see that? I didn't get one. - [Cheema] I'm sorry, dear. How insensitive of me. - She's getting married on Rakhri day. Aunty Chee, am I doing the right thing? - Just follow your heart, beti. Change never comes easy. (sobbing) (percussive music) - What are you doing in here by yourself? Your house is full of people. - My house may be full but my heart is empty. - It's your daughter's engagement party. You have an obligation to your guests. - Sometimes our sense of obligation can cloud what is important. - She made her choice. - You did not give her a choice. - She's headstrong and foolish. - She is young. She is young. - Holy mother of Jesus! - Mom, what's wrong?! - Oh holy mother of grace. - Mom what's wrong? - No, no the ticket. - The what? - The ticket. We won! - We won? We won, we won. We won, we won! What exactly did we win? - The whole bloody motherload. - The whole jackpot? Are you sure? - 500,000 big ones! No more night shifts! It's about time this Irish family got their pot of gold. And it's all because of you. Those little ones in there are magic. - Come here you. (cars whooshing) - Thank you. - What do you have there? (gentle music) - Oh be careful with the blessed Mother for goodness sake. Oh, good, could you turn her just a bit? Yes, oh she's beautiful. Turn her just a bit, yes. She'll look over the street. Hi, look she's here. Oh she's lovely. Thank you. Well how long are you gonna stare at it, dear? It's not gonna open itself. It's more of those pink sweet balls. - Miss O'Donnell? - [Miss O'Donnell] Hmm? - Do you believe in spiritual energy? - You mean God? Everybody believes in God. They just don't know it till life bites them in the arse. Oh maybe now we'll find out what's in the package. - Oh, when did that arrive? - It was at the door when I came in. - Looks just like the last one, don't you think? - I'm hoping. Well come on, they're not gonna be very good stale. - A rakhri. Wednesday is Rakhri day. - A what? - A rakhri. - Can you eat it? - It's a wristband that a sister ties around her brother's wrist on rakhri day. Ruman looks forward to it all year. - To that thing? Well he has to get out more. - Mom. - Oh she knows I don't mean anything. But what sort of young man would wear that frou frou thing on his wrist? - It's a symbolic gesture, mother. And need I remind you the strange old green men running around our toadstools in the front yard? - Completely different! - Yeah, real. - I'm disappointed. I was looking forward to having one of those loodoo things. - [Kelly] Any ideas? - I'm completely stumped. - You don't suppose it could be your mom or your dad? - Why would they go through so much trouble? I'm only a couple of houses away. - I bet it's Pria. This is her way of getting you over there on rukhri day. Besides, you should go over there if Ruman really wants you to. You shouldn't have to miss out on everything. They're still your family, you know? - I don't wanna hurt Pria or Ruman. But my mother, she has to make the first move. (percussive exotic music) - It's the mother of that girl named Gugan. - Right then, she's going to get triplets. You don't know who the father is. - She's not married? - No, not married. - You got something to say to me, say it to my face. Just as I thought. Cowards, both of you. My daughter made a mistake but she has more courage in her baby finger than both of you have in your entire bodies put together! Come, Pria. (somber music) (chimes lightly ringing) (light music) (inspiring music) (camera clicking) (speaking in foreign language) - Gugan, don't go! - Did you hear that? Did you hear that? (speaking in foreign language) My son can speak! - I knew you'd come. I knew you couldn't disappoint Ruman on rakhri day. - Through you God has forgiven me and given me my son back. It's a good thing you inherited my stubbornness. - This wasn't about Ruman finding his voice. This will always be your home. - Welcome to the family. - You too. (light music) (chattering) - You like that? All right guys scram, get out of here. - What are you doing here? - Well, I've been doing some thinking. And I guess this is the right thing to do here. Oh wait, here, hold this. - I can't, someone might see me. - Right. Okay, here it goes. Gugan, will you marry me? (laughing) Okay that wasn't supposed to be funny. - You've dropped your girlfriend. - Well I'm glad you're having a good time with this. - No, it's just, you're proposing. - And is that so hard to believe? - No. Just you're not, - Not what, a stand-up kind of guy? - No, the marrying kind. - I'm gonna be a father. We all gotta grow up sooner or later, right? - What does your mother have to say about all this? - My mother? Hell, she's just happy you're not some white chick living in the trailer with five kids. - I think it's so romantic that he proposed to you. - Oh please. The guy has never had a job in his life. How is he gonna support a family? - Don't be so cynical. I'm sure he'll get a job. - Doing what? - Everybody has some skills. - Not Arjan. Not unless you think that rolling a joint with one hand and your eyes closed is a skill. - I still think it's so romantic that he proposed to you. Don't you, Gugan? - Huh? I guess. What's so amusing, boys? - Oh nothing. Just, ooh, aah. Nav, I like it best when I'm on top. - Shut your face, you little weasel. - Hey Gugan, we'll help you get your stuff back from crazy O'Donnell's for 10 bucks. - Wait a minute. How did you guys know where we were going? - We heard you talking. - [Gugan] What? - Nothing. Roop doesn't know what he's talking about. - Okay, you guys better come clean or I'm gonna have to do some pretty loud talking about what you've been spending your money on. - It was Piper's idea to but the naked girly books. I didn't even want to look. He made me. He said if a guy passed up a chance to look at a naked girl, he gets a visit from the fag fairy. - Shut up. - We hear everything. The walls are paper thin. It's almost like we're in the same room. - [Gugan] Yeah right. - Go ahead. Ask me what you guys had for dinner last night and how Pria likes Nav to-- - Ugh, let's go. - [Piper] Ooh, Nav. - You little pricks. - Hey Gugan, what was in the packages? - You idiot. - [Gugan] Okay, start talking. - It'll cost you. - It's a shame. - [Roop] What? - It's a shame that you're gonna have to shut this little business enterprise down. - You can't make us. - Sure I can. I'll just complain to the city about all the noise and traffic it generates. And the fact that you guys aren't licensed to sell magic water. - [Piper] You're bluffing! - Try me. - A man gave the packages to us and told us to deliver them to you. - What man? What did he look like? - Just a man. - Pria, go get me that number. - An Indian guy. We never seen him before. - Yeah he talked funny. - [Gugan] What did he say? - He said "Deliver this to the knocked up chick "that used to live upstairs." And since you're the only knocked up chick in this nice wholesome neighborhood, we took it to you. - Did he say anything else? - [Piper] No. - Roop. - No, that's all he said. He gave us coupons for free Hot Fudge Sundaes from Lucky's. He works there. - I can't believe you brought the fricking Battlestar for a stakeout. - I had no choice. - That's him! - Yeah! - That lying son of a bitch. He's supposed to be in England. - I told you. One asshole in your pants is enough. - Follow him. - Starboard, captain. (birds chirping) Oh yeah, no one will notice us in this thing. - Hurry, we're gonna lose him. There he is! Okay, okay, hang back, he'll see us. - Why didn't you ask him where he lived? - I didn't want to seem too forward. - Oh I see, asking him where he lived seems too forward but banging him is not? - You guys, okay where's he going? You want me to follow him still? - Yeah, maybe to run him over. - [Jessie] Hey he's headed toward your street. - Whoah wouldn't that be weird if he lived like a block away from you or something? - Holy shit, he's going into Ramsey's suite! - He's history. The Count will suck him dry. - Let's go. - You going already? - Oh we were just gonna go through some last minute touches on the car. - You girls are representing our business in the parade. So make sure you behave yourselves. And be careful. Today's the eclipse. (creaking) - [Pria] We're breaking and entering. - Not if we have just cause. A landlord can enter a rented premises if there's an emergency. Don't you smell the smoke? - You know, I don't think this is a good idea. If this guy moves out, mom is gonna kill us. He hasn't bounced a single rent check. - Shh, listen. - Oh god. Oh they really have been listening to me and Nav. Hey. Hey, I know this guy from somewhere. - [Raymond] Hi, sorry I can't take your call right now so please leave a message. - Oh, hi, it's Pria from Baba Guru Sweets. I just need to double check your order. That's where I saw him. I don't get it though. I mean why would Ramsey want pink ludoos and why wouldn't he tell us who he was? - Because Mr. Ramsey is not who he claims to be. Listen, tell Arjan to pick me up from Lucky's. I have a few things to take care of. - No. You're supposed to be on the float handing out sweets. - I'll be quick. - Mr. Ramsey I presume. Or is it Raymond? Who are you? - Let me explain. - It had better be good. There's a law against making false claims on your rental agreement and sending strange gifts to people. - My real name is Raymond. I had to use a false name on the rental agreement. - How much is false about you? - Just the name. But what's in a name, right? - In this case, everything. Our whole relationship has been a lie. - My feelings for you are not. - How can I believe you? You've done nothing but deceive me. This has just been one sick game to you. - I admit it started out that way. But the more I got to know you-- - Just stop. You know what really hurts is that you know every intimate detail about me and I know absolutely nothing about you. And the little bit I thought I knew turned out to be a lie. - Please, open it. It'll explain everything. - There's no point. Some thing's just not meant to be. (horn honking) - Please Gugan, you're making a mistake. - The only mistake I made was believing that you and I had something special. - Gugan, don't throw it all away. Tell me that you love him and that he makes you feel the way that I make you feel and I'll step aside. - He's the father. It's the right thing to do. - I see. I guess this is goodbye then. I'll fly out tonight. Wait. Please take this. It was meant for you. (light music) - Stop, I can't do this. - Oh thank god. What? - You don't have to be so relieved. - I'm sorry babe. But it would be selfish of me to be with the same woman for the rest of my life. Gugan, wait. I'm sorry. I just can't do this right now. Hey. Don't forget this. (bright parade music) (train hooting) - Well god, at least smile. You're scaring away the kids. It's supposed to be a celebration. - I don't feel much like celebrating. - Well pass out the ludoos then. - [Gugan] Oh shit! - [Kelly] What? Hey, that looks like the one you have at home. - It is. It's the matching pair. But... Oh my god! (hectic music) (girls shouting) - [Kelly] Go, go , go, go! (mystic music) (sobbing) - She walks in beauty like the night of cloudless lines and starry skies. - Why is it that an English accent can make even the corniest line sound intelligent? - You mean like the stars will conspire to make you my destiny, I can't stand to live my life without you. Marry me. - Yeah, something like that. You're supposed to be in India. - You're not the only one whose family immigrated, you know. - You're not at all what I had imagined. - Nor you. - You're supposed to wear a turban and talk with a thick Indian accent. - And you're supposed to be submissive and walk two steps behind me. - I can't believe you came all the way from England just to check me out. - I came to fulfill my destiny. - Are you sure this isn't too much destiny for you? - Up until now I thought I was destined for a life without children. - Why? - Everyone has their baggage. - One man's baggage is another woman's treasure.
