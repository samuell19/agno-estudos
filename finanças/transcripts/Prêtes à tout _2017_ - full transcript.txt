Penitentiary Administration Whatever It Takes Thank you. Mrs. Berthou. Alain Crémieux, investigating judge. Have a seat. I'm investigating Mr. Bouazid's death... a.k.a. "Ghost". Mrs. Berthou, do you know Ms. Daoudi? - No. - "No." Of course. I know you're lying to protect your kids but there's no point anymore. They admitted to doing it. They're giving their statements at the station. Only the truth will help them now. It's my fault. I take full responsibility. I'm listening. It started one month ago. I didn't know Samir, much less Nadia. After graduating, I found myself teaching in a rather exclusive high school. Life seemed so simple. My eldest children were easy to raise. Romain was the youngest. I thought I knew him by heart. I didn't see it coming. "Here are fruits, flowers, leaves, and branches," "and here too is my heart, which beats for you." Verlaine. A hint for the mock exam. Thank you, Ma'am. Thank you for gracing us with your presence, Juliette. Louis, has Romain left the lunchroom? Yes. We went to Mouettes café. - He should be here soon. - His class starts at 2pm. This is Romain. Don't leave a message. I won't listen. It's Mom. It's five till. Try to be on time for math. Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? Fred, I'm talking. Thank you. I'd like to officially announce that we have a sign-up sheet for the Easter hike. I recommend coming. I've prepared quite a program. It'll be a good time. Another test? Aline, are you a masochist? I'm one of the few who enjoys grading papers. Unlike you. Romain hasn't seen one since January. I'm one of the few who wants students to enjoy reading even if I'm behind. But if your son insists on being graded... He's more concerned about his skateboarding. The model-student rebels. Great! I feel reassured. Hello? Yes, he's my son. Sorry? Hello. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Aline Berthou. My son... - Do you have a form of ID? We'll call you. What's going on? Have a seat. Someone will get you. My son is 15. He was arrested in a café. I deserve some explanations. Hello? Hello, Josiane? Aline Berthou. Yes, Romain blacked out. I'm taking him to the doctor's. No. He's fine. Have 10th-graders' test moved to Friday. Yes, I'll keep you updated. Thank you, Josiane. Arnaud, call me when you get this. Thank you. - Ms. Daoudi. - Yes. Mrs. Berthou. Your sons are being held while we investigate a case of drug trafficking. They'll be called in for questioning. You can go. We'll call tomorrow. Thank you. Excuse me! - Your son... - His name is Samir. Do our sons know each other? It's pretty easy to see. They were dealing together and got caught. It can't be. They're in custody. There must be a reason. - It might be a mistake. - Sure, if it makes you feel better. Hello, Jacqueline? Sorry for bothering you. I can't get a hold of my husband. His phone is turned off. No, no. No, he can call me when he gets out. Thank you. Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. Are you OK? We lost little Théo. He held on for three years. Even when you expect it, it's still... I'm really sorry. How is Romain? He's over at a friend's. Good for him. I'm taking a sleeping pill. I need to get some sleep. You didn't tell him? I thought I could deal with it on my own. I was waiting to know more. I was sure Romain hadn't done anything wrong. We're investigating drug trafficking at the high school. Romain was called in with a certain Samir. We found 20 grams of hash on him. You're facing three years. I never sell. It's for my own use. Using and carrying drugs are punishable by one year of jail and a fine of 3,750 euros. My son never causes problems, at home or at school. I'm sure he was pressured into it. It won't happen again. This isn't a case of candy theft. Consuming cannabis is punishable by law. By buying, you're an accomplice to dealing. Your dealers may be armed. It looks cool in the movies but in reality, it's a very dangerous game. Do you know the statistics on deaths by settlings of scores? I don't get it. You've got a good background. Your parents are together and care for you. You're ahead one year in the best high school... Why do you hang out with Samir? We met at an office New Year's party. His mother is a nurse at my dad's hospital. - You never mentioned him. - Your son is a minor. He's 15. It's your job to make sure he keeps good company. So... You're going to be summoned to a Juvenile Court. You're a first offender. Based on your status, it'll surely be ruled as a mistake. The judge will probably issue a warning to give you a chance. You won't have a second one. A second offense means prison. Understand? Hurry up. Don't even think about seeing your friend again. We're done here, right? Because you think this is Samir's fault? Are you happy with yourself? Disengage the safety lock. Seatbelt on. Take off your cap. - Will you tell Dad? - That's all you care about? No. I won't ruin his day. He has other problems. He would be so disappointed. Why do you smoke? It's a dangerous drug. It's illegal. Everyone smokes, you know. So you should too? Are you stupid? And what was she insinuating? That you buy from Samir to sell it at school? Come on. You know I don't. Don't take that tone with me. I've never hit my son. I've always tried to respect him and trust him. Anyhow, I don't have a choice. I'm a single mother. I work nights and I take classes for entrance exams as well. Until then, Samir had never let me down. But for months, he hadn't looked me in the eye. He stopped telling me about his day. He didn't laugh like before. I was afraid and didn't know what to do. I wasn't going to show it. We're no queers! Hey, Samir! You're back? So, how was your night in jail? You can forget about Samir. He's grounded. I know. Please excuse me. I'm very sorry. I received an emergency call. My mother broke her hip. It won't happen again. Thank you so much. Good bye. - Hey, Safia. - Hi, Nadia. - You OK? - Fine. - You wanted to see me? - Samir! He wants to give you something. - How's the baby? - Meh. I swear, I'm exhausted. But... - All this? - Don't worry. He paid for it. - Really? - Don't worry about it. OK. Thank you so much. I don't want any more of your presents. I'm not hungry. - You ruined my appetite. - Mom... Shut it! That's enough nonsense. Shit! Go on. Throw your life away, if you want. Go to jail. Act like a qaid, for all I care. I've got my own life. I have an exam in a month. I'm not acting like a qaid. You're acting worse. Can't you see you're being used? Only you got caught. Meanwhile, Ghost is pocketing everything. When you get locked up, they'll be quick to replace you. And we'll need to pay your fine. Your principal called. You're expelled for 1 week. That'll look great on your school record. Or your permanent record. Did you think of that? You know what that is? It follows you your whole life. Listen to me, Samir... We can eat pasta every day... We don't need to go on vacation. But graduating is the only way you'll make it out of here. Do you understand? You're a good student. You can't throw your life away. You hear? You just can't! Eat. Romain Turn off that phone. We need to have a talk. Your father isn't eating with us. No kidding. It doesn't make him happy either. He'd like to spend more time at home. But I'm here, Romain. I'm listening and I believe you. You messed up, wanted to smoke like everybody else... I can understand, you know. But you have to talk to me. Do you want to see a psychologist? I'm sorry I slapped you. I know that's not the answer. But think how I feel. I have to study for my math test. I have to hide out in my room. Hold on a minute. Good night, Sweetie. I know you think I'm a "drag", as you would say, but you don't realize what cannabis does to your brain as it develops. They've done many studies on it. Smoking can destroy your neurons and provoke hallucinations. Let's start over, OK? No more allowance money, no going out, and we'll have you tested to make sure you aren't smoking. And no more seeing Samir. Got it? Avoid him. Now, let's forget about this. I love you. Samir? Yes. How will you do it? Thank you. Samir explained what happened: "After being arrested, I swear I wanted to quit." "But when the cops showed up, I panicked." "I threw it down the toilet." "Ghost gave me the hash to sell at the Mouettes café" "and I'd bring him the money. I owed him 2,000 euros." "2,000. Can you imagine?" Did he say anything? If Samir had told me he owed 2,000 euros to Ghost, I would have borrowed the money, worked day and night. I'd never let my son be indebted to that psychopath. He was afraid and didn't say anything. They thought they could deal with it alone. You flushed it? Are you crazy? What could I do, genius? There were cops everywhere. - And Ghost? - Shut up. He doesn't know. Fuck, I'm done for. Mourad owed him 300 bucks. You have no idea how bad it was. What are you going to do? - I'll get protection. - What? - I need to get a gun. - Are you nuts? Relax, I'm kidding. Stop messing. We'll get the money. Later, bro. I get out at 4. See you. Romain. - What's up? - Not much. You? We heard you got arrested. Scary shit. Were you flipping out? It was OK. I didn't say anything. - Are you facing time? - I just got a warning. Worst-case scenario, I'll do some community service. Will you be at my birthday on Saturday? OK. Can you score us some coke? - Um... I don't know. - Come on! I'm counting on you. I was in my underwear for five hours. There wasn't any heating and some strange guy was watching me... Romain. You forgot your gym clothes. So now you're popular? There's nothing to be proud of. - I'd keep a low profile. - You're embarrassing me. I'll drive you home after school. - Mom, please. - Your keys. How does one define a Cornelian dilemma without copying from the Internet? Pierre... Minimum effort. That's a D. Sophie had the best definition: "An internal conflict between love and honor," "provoking a deep and painful crisis." The rest was interesting but full of English terms. Check your work. It won't pass. C? But... As a reminder, the word "opportunity" doesn't mean "chance" in French You can use "occasion" instead. And what would you use for "my son deals hash"? "Shitty dealer"? - And for "pinner"? - Joint? - Blunt? - Spliff? I'm helping your vocabulary. I'm disappointed in you, Sophie. Hi! Are you joining us on the hike? Not this time. - Time for your tea? - No, I'll have a coffee. - Here. - Thanks. Say, how... - How do you find Romain? - You're asking me to tell on him? I don't know what he's up to. He's avoiding me... His grades have gone down this semester. Maybe he's just tired of being valedictorian. I'm kidding. I promise, I'll tell you if I see any problems. - Well, actually... - Aline, I signed you up. Jesus, Françoise! I said no! Hello, Jacqueline. This is Aline Berthou. I'd like to speak to Ms. Daoudi. She's a healthcare provider. You wanted to see me? I've only got five minutes. Right before my class on palliative care. So? What's going on? - Our boys are still hanging out. - And? It's up to us to watch them. Are you saying I'm not watching my son? He's a bad influence on yours? I didn't say that. I don't know Samir. He's like other kids, but he likes school even if his school isn't as great as yours. If he continues, I'll turn him in myself. I'm serious and he knows it. You want them to stop seeing each other? You can try. They call each other all day and meet up at the skatepark every night. The coolest spot in town, apparently. I didn't know. Excuse me. I can't be late. My son doesn't open up to me either. You're still a little lost at 15, don't you think? Don't worry. The police got to them. It won't happen again. They're teenagers. They speak another language. We just need to be supportive. Come on. Let's keep in touch. Thank you. Thank you. Did you know Mr. Bouazid? Everybody knows him, in our hood. "Ghost." A fitting name for that asshole. Every time we think he's locked up for good, he comes back. Even when he's in jail, his word is law. I watched him grow up. I saw his mother become afraid of her own son. These kids think life's just a video game. They feel nothing. They have no emotions. They don't belong in jail but in a psychiatric hospital. The problem is, his business makes the neighborhood thrive. Excuse me. Hey, faggots! You're skateboarding and you didn't invite your pal? What's up, Samir? I wanted to come, too. Come here. Where you going? My best bud! It's Samir! - Let him go! - What you gonna do? Shut the hell up! - You want your teeth knocked out? - He's my pal. What are you doing? We're just messing around. Right, Samir? You think I'm afraid of you? Touch my son again and I'll call the cops on you. We're going home. - Did you hear that? - She thinks she's tough. And you, shouldn't you be at home? You! Watch it or you're dead. Do you want to talk about it? There's nothing to say. It's a game. Yeah... It looked like you were having a great time. Samir, are you still dealing with Ghost? - Mom... - You'd tell me, right? He wanted to know about the arrest. He's using your fear. Don't let him use you. You'll get sentenced if you mess up. Understand? Come on, unload the groceries. Again? I don't believe it. Tonight it's TV dinners and our show. - OK. - I'm going to study a bit. - Can I use the computer? - Go ahead. Samir, forget about Ghost and his gang. In three months, I'll graduate and we can move. Yeah right. You asked for a transfer four years ago. It's society's fault. I never ask anyone for anything. I always get by. I just say hello and goodbye to the neighbors. No one knows about my life. Between Samir's father who was... a bad decision, and not being in contact with my family, I've always counted on myself. Until now, I was proud of that. But at that point... I felt so alone. You can go. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Let's continue. Second Semester Report Card (February 2017) Sophomore Year Romain! Romain. What were you doing? It's your report card. - Hello, Ma'am. - Hello, Juliette. It's nice to see you here. I didn't know you were seeing each other. My 17th birthday's on Saturday. Can Romain come? I don't think so. Sorry, Juliette, but... I need to talk to his father first. Romain is only 15. And we have an agreement. No need to tell her my life story. I'm going. Goodbye Ma'am. Goodbye, Juliette. Can I see her out? Is that allowed? According to Romain's statement, Juliette came to order cocaine for her birthday. She brought him 500 euros, that day. - You had no idea? - How could I know? She's a normal kid, an average student, transparent. I knew her as a child. Her parents are pharmacists, members of the PTA... Respectable people. I think I felt relieved that Romain had a girlfriend. He was younger than the others and was bullied. He was often alone in the courtyard. OK, he messed up. But I didn't want to put him down further. He had enough pressure from his father. This report card isn't so great. - What's going on? - Just a little drop. It happens. He went from an A to C average, though. He's late to class. Lack of concentration... Are you in love? You have to get it together. Sure, it's great to be a ladies' man, but... Your brother got A's and had rugby practice every night. You shouldn't compare them. I'm just saying he should go out for sports. I skateboard. I hope it's a phase. He'll pull it together. Have faith in him. Romain, do you have the phone? What are you doing? Are you snooping? - You promised you'd stop. - It's old... - You're like the DEA! - That's enough! I'm sick of you! You never believe me. - Give it back! - Wake up, Romain! Did you hear the police? Smoking hash lands you in jail for one year. What do you want? How am I supposed to help you? I lied to your father. Go on, tell him. You know he won't give a damn. - Hello, Jacqueline. - Hello, Mrs. Berthou. He's with a patient. I'll tell him you're here. That's alright. I'll wait here. Thank you. Do you have an appointment with Prof. Berthou? We just came to thank him. He was wonderful. Right? Pediatric Consultation Centre - We'll call you with the results. - Thank you. It's about Romain. Can this wait? Théo's parents are here. Of course it can. It always does. Hello. I got your message. Can you wait in the office? - I'll be right there. - Thank you. - What's going on? - Romain needs his father. Your son isn't well. I don't know what to do. He needs guidance. OK... Can we talk about this tonight at home? I'll be home around 9 pm. I promise. I promise. I can't give you a one-month receipt. They're done by trimester. Yeah, OK. I get it. Thanks. Sure. I have another call. Hello, Samir? No. The visit was cancelled. Can you take care of dinner? I'll do the dishes. I won't be home for another 45 minutes. You gonna turn us in? Get out of here! What are you looking at? Get the hell away from here! You know what's coming to you. You know who I am. I'll cut you up. I don't give a damn. Go ahead, turn me in. Just try. Go ahead. Let's move. Need a ride? I'd press charges if I were you. Yeah, right. They'll protect me. I'll be a witness. I saw them threaten you. Don't get involved. I don't want trouble. Nothing happened. They'll leave me alone if I stay out of their way. I'd move, if I were you. Great idea. I hadn't thought of that. I don't know this neighborhood. It's worth a visit. This is us. We live on the 7th floor. The elevator has been under repair since... Every drug addict in town shops here. They call it "supermarket tower". See the kids with the earbuds? Thanks to them, no one gets caught. If the police come poking around, the place clears out. That couple comes here regularly. Good clients are taken care of so they'll keep coming. They're our VIP's. Drugs are stashed with nannies like my neighbor, Safia. Four kids, single mother. It helps pay the rent. If the police shows up, she's first to go. You're not going to find a theater, a music school, or a library around here. You need to take the bus to go to the pool. I'm sorry. I wasn't tactful. - I only wanted... - To tell me what to do? Obviously, you're a teacher. You know better. Sorry. I needed to let my anger out on someone. Thank you for the ride. How about some tea? - I can't right now... - It's fine, I get it. Another time. What's your number? 0616119448. - I'm Nadia. - I'm Aline. The guy with the orange coat had a gun. The other two had knives. They threatened my friend at work. - Will she press charges? - No. She's afraid. They deal out in open, in front of everybody. Everyone knows what goes on over there. We're well-aware of these guys. They've done time quite often. - This can't go on. - We're investigating. We must catch them in the act, witnesses, proof. There's a code of silence, so it takes a while. Tell your friend to make a statement. She's afraid of retaliation. Her kids got into some trouble and she'd rather not deal with us, is that it? Vicious cycle. There's no escape. What are you waiting for? Her dead body? Believe me, we do the best we can. Of course. Please excuse me. Another round? Think you're ready? Romain, you left your bag in the doorway. You're home early. You could have told me. Honey, do you realize how much you criticize? I cancelled my class. I wanted to spend some time with my son. Go rest, we'll take care of dinner. OK? See you in a bit. Rematch. Go on. Pass me your gamepad. Afraid I'll cheat? - How do you accelerate? - Press on the square. Not bad for beginners, don't you think? It's pretty good, right? Who wants to go to the movies? Not tonight, please. It's Juliette's birthday. You're most certainly not going. His grades... And for once, you're at home with us. If it's for a good cause, just this once, right? - OK, be home by midnight. - Cool! Thanks. Yes, my love... there's another woman in his life. Are you ready? You seem nervous. Don't be. You look handsome. What are you doing? You can go, but I need to check your bag first. There's nothing. Give it back. We made a deal. OK. Fine. Dig around. I don't feel like going anyways. - Why? - I don't know anyone. It sucks. You know Juliette. It's a great way to make friends. "A great way to make friends"? Why do you think they're there? Of course you want to go. Drop it. Do you want me to drop you off? No, it's fine. I'll take my scooter. Have a great time. If you'd checked his bag, you'd have found 30 g of cocaine that he and Samir were going to sell. They owed Ghost some money. They had to. That's an excuse? Smart and honest kids like them? Because dealing coke is a way to pay back a debt? The blow's here! Hi, Nadia? I can't reach Samir. He never comes home this late. They're at a party. They'll be back soon. Don't be so naive, it's 2 am! Where is this party? I'll come pick you up. Thank you. Everything OK? I can't sleep. I'm going to watch a DVD. Juliette. Juliette! Where is Romain? - Have you seen Romain and Samir? - Left. - Where did they go? When? - Hey! Let them sober up. This is what Romain declared in his statement: "We sold everything at the party." "In 30 minutes, we made 3,000 euros." "Samir wanted to go but Juliette cut some lines" "and there was vodka." "After 4 hours, Samir asked me to take him home." "I was completely wasted." Fuck you, Ghost! - Give me the money. - What? Give it to me. Hurry up. - Don't hang around. - Shit... Shit, hurry up. - Come on, faster. - It's fine. You're afraid of them? Mourad, go home. Don't touch me! - What're you doing? - Hand it over! Let go! What should we do? Shall I take you home? I'm not going home without my son. I'll check every police station and hospital. - Don't get so worked up. - I've had enough of your airs! This is your son's fault. He drags Samir to these parties. - If anything happens to him... - Shh! Hello, Arnaud? What? No. I... Yes, right away. Where is he? Where is he? Where? I haven't done anything. Let go of me! Everything's fine. No broken bones. We gave them a sedative. We'll let them rest. They'll be out tomorrow. This is Nadia, Samir's mother. She's a geriatrics practical nurse. May I have a moment? It's not written in the file, but I wanted to tell you... Can you come here for a minute? Romain had 2 g of alcohol in his blood and traces of cocaine. Do you have an explanation? Little punk. He's not going to Juliette's anytime soon. What was he doing in that part of town? I don't know! Ask him yourself. We'll at least have to file a report for the stolen scooter. No. Samir lives there. It could get him in trouble. Let those guys go so they can do it again? Do you think that's logical? The boys who stole the scooter also stole the money. Samir became even more indebted to Ghost. 5,000 euros, if I understand correctly. And he still didn't say anything? No. Are you OK, Samir? How do you feel? I'm in pain all over. I need to lie down. One moment. - What were you doing at the party? - I was just with Romain. I didn't take anything, I swear. You're not hiding anything? Does the scooter have anything to do with Ghost? No. You would tell me, right? I'm here for you, you know? Everything's fine, Mom. Don't worry. Can I get some oxygen? You'll end up sounding like Darth Vador. I'll quit after the exam. - Do you need help studying? - You don't mind? Hello? Don't deny it, little punk. I just left the station. They told me everything. I know your history. Believe me, I'll protect my son. No... You listen to me. Starting now, don't call him, don't go near him... You disappear from his life. I never want to hear about you again! Yeah, I hope so. What a way to talk. It's easy to accuse others. Because I should act politely? My wife doesn't tell me that my son spent the night in jail. This spoiled kid is taking drugs while acting like a model son, taking me for a fool! So excuse me for being tense. You know what disappoints me the most in all of this? Your lack of courage. I deal with kids who fight illnesses every day. You only make me feel contempt. There's no other word for it. That isn't the right tactic, Arnaud. - So he made a mistake... - It's his last one. I'm calling Bertrand. His son is in a boarding school in the USA and he stays out of trouble. - It won't solve the problem. I'll straighten out my son by cutting him off. And his pushover Mommy won't be there. We're both to blame. You're never around. Sorry for having to work 15 hours a day at my job. Now that everything's out, what do you propose to do? Where did I put his number? You're fleeing the problem. It's wrong. I don't really want your opinion. I wouldn't say you're making the right choices these days. You think you make the right decisions? Go back to your kids. Arnaud and I usually never fight. What do you want me to say? Go hug him. - He has a conference in Geneva. - Oh, poor guy! You must admit, he's not trying to understand. He heals others' kids, but puts his in boarding school. You can't know the pressure he faces. Yes, I do. He's known in the field. Everyone loves him, here. Well, admires him. Well, both. I'm not criticizing but Samir lost his friend and is stuck at home. He hasn't lost much. Only a rich and egocentric kid. I've lost my students' respect because of him. He'll end up breaking up my marriage, too. I think I'm starting to hate him. Even the best mothers need a break sometimes. - Let's go have a drink. - It's on me. Oh, don't be so bougie. Fine, we can split. - OK. - It isn't past your curfew, I hope? Samir, where are you? You won't solve anything by running away. It's late. Come back home. I just want to know how 15-year-old boys got a gun. It's easy in our neck of the woods. According to his confession, he got it from... a certain Mourad. Samir defended him when he suffered reprisals. - He helped him out in return. - You knew? Of course I didn't! I already told you: I thought he would tell me if he had a problem instead of defending himself. - But you find it to be normal? - For a boy to buy a gun because he lives in fear, because he can't find protection any other way? No one would find that normal. No one. Samir! Samir! Samir, come out of your hole you little rat! Come on out, I said! Come out here! Shit, listen up, you little fucker! We're going to find you! You're a dead man! We know you're there! Come out, now! Romain, can we talk for a minute? I'm late. I have to go. You have 20 minutes. Don't run away. - We can talk at lunch. - OK. We'll eat together? OK, great. - Wait for me at noon. - Yeah. Noon. In front of school. Bye! Thus, we find... recurring themes of Racinian tragedy: confinement... Internal dilemmas, power struggles, passion... Where does confinement take place in Bajazet? It happens in the seraglio. In Ottoman palaces, seraglios were confined living quarters used by wives and concubines. - The harem... - Oh, things are heating up! Don't blush like that. You're all just a bunch of idiots. Shit! Jesus... It happens to me too, when I'm tired. Here. Thanks. You're son didn't show up today. This is Romain. Don't leave a message. I won't listen. Juliette. Can I see you for a minute? It's about your essay for the mock test. - Plagiarism. - I didn't cheat. I'm not saying that, but I'd like to talk about it. I'll take you home. I'll admit, I borrowed Louis' paper. - Are you going to flunk me? - I didn't read it. - Romain took cocaine at your party. - Wait... We can talk about this in front of you parents... Everyone takes coke at parties. Just for the night. - What's the problem? - Romain's carrying this around! I'd say it's a problem. He sells us the coke. Sorry? You know... He's our dealer. Get the hell out. Leave! Put that away. Get rid of it immediately. - Where did he get a gun? - What does it matter? They're hiding. They're scared. They're in danger. Sam, please pick up. We're looking for you. Samir, if you're with Romain, tell him he's not in trouble. We won't tell anyone. We just want to help. We need to tell the police. It's Romain. They're in a parking lot. - What? - Let's go. - There's a car here. - Over there. Take that! You want more? You should have left town. - Stay down! - I'm gonna fuck you up! What're you doing? Take the wheel and leave the motor running. Leave them alone! Leave them alone! - Leave them alone! - You here for a gang bang? - Drop it! - OK, calm down. - Leave them alone! - Calm down. She's crazy. - Stop! Stop! - Leave them alone. Let them go. Move it. It's fine. Chill out. Go on. In the car. In the car! Hurry up! - Hands up. Don't move. - Lower the gun. - Hands up! - Relax. It's fine, I'm not moving. Go after the car. Run! Come on! Go around! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! I thought these things had safety locks. These things usually have safety locks, right? Stop. Stop! Leave him alone! Stop! Calm down. Calm down! Calm down. We can't stay here. They'll find us. We'll go to the police. They'll do an investigation. They were armed. - It was self-defense. - The kids were dealing coke. Do you know what they risk? This can't be happening. Listen to me. Look at me. Look at me... Listen to me. We'll leave town. We'll calm down and think. And then we'll decide. OK? But we can't stay here. There you go. A body was found in an abandoned parking lot in Fontenay-sur-Marne. According to initial findings, the man was deliberately run over by a car which took off. Residents in the area say it's yet another settling of scores linked to drug trafficking, which has spread throughout neighborhood. The victim was known to the police. He died while on the way to the hospital. On the other side of the planet, in the Fiji Islands... He's dead. Nadia, he was scum. A deadly dealer. I killed a man. Let's leave. Relax. Relax... Calm down. Piece of shit! Stupid bitch! Yes, it was them. That's my wife. What'll we do? Where will we go? We'll be OK. We saved them. That's all that matters. But until when? We can't keep running. They'll catch up with us. - Let's call a lawyer. - No. My son won't go to jail. Never. It's too late. We must turn ourselves in. And have done all of this for nothing? You know what jail means? Their lives will be over. They're minors. Maybe they'll only serve a few months. - We have no choice, Aline. - We can protect them. Here's what we'll do. You'll all go home and pretend nothing happened. The police won't trace it back to you. I'll admit to everything. We'll agree on a version of the story. - Are you crazy? - It's the best solution. I'm a respectable mother. I'll say I was attacked. At most, I'll risk probation. The important thing is for the kids to be safe. Understand? Can you imagine your son's guilt, had he accepted? You asked him to lie. It was all my fault. He wasn't aware of the repercussions of his actions. It was up to me to understand the situation... to keep him out of danger. They're so young. Maybe they grew up overnight. There's no more you can do for your son. Perhaps it's better for him. Your children must face the consequences of their actions. As for you, you'll both be detained until the trial. That was a true act of bravery, boys. Dad, I'm afraid. I'm here for you. I'm right here. Hey! SIX MONTHS LATER The judge ruled it was self-defense. The case was dismissed. We expected this, of course, but... now it's official. They're free. Your mother is exhausted. She needs to rest for a bit, but... she'll come see you very soon. Nadia is still going to take her exam to become a nurse. She feels good about it. She's fighting. Good for her. The judge was very good to Samir. He focused on his good grades. So your friend isn't going to jail. He'll go to a boarding school under legal protection in case of retaliation, you know? He asked if he could write to you. He misses you. We miss you. I started dealing at 14. I wanted to buy a present for my mother. I wanted her 35th birthday to be special. She deserved it, struggling on her own and having faith in me. But when you start, you can't stop. It's easy money, and you have needs and temptations. Your supplier protects you. He feels like a family. He's like a big brother. When it's no longer a choice... "When it's no longer a choice," "that your 'big brother' is a gang leader..." That your 'big brother' is a gang leader... - "...who won't help you..." - who won't help you... "it's too late." "You're afraid of retaliation." "You have no one to turn to." "So you keep going and dig yourself in deeper." "It's a system. You do as you're told." "You're only 15, and your life is about business" "and settlings of scores." Because trafficking helps everyone. It stops the suburbs from exploding. Cannabis is the youth's main employer in our neighborhood. Julien, Nabil... - "Grégory..." - Yacine, Erwan... - "Skander." "These are your children..." These are your children... who died for nothing. Subtitles: Alexandra Joslyn for ECLAIR
