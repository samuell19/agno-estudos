- Praise God. - Forever. Why don't you sleep? We ran out of fuel. I'm going down to the mine to ask before they run out. Are you Evin's bastard daughter? Tell your mother there will be a wedding. We ran out of oil. As promised. You're too good for me, Mom. What are you doing here? Don't you like your new father? Here it is, dulled. Move. She's not asleep yet. Wait. Let me look. But quietly, yes? Let me see you. There is no slamming of doors in my house. Do not shake them. "The owner of a respectable German house in Prague will accept a girl who is applied in manual work and who understands German." "The train ticket is will send in advance." Will I ever see you again? Sleep 26 Reza.. Listen to me, even if is far from you. I will, Mom. The Emperor can see it everything if you are a good girl. - The new maid? - Yes. Follow me. "LA CRIADA". Where do you come from? Do you speak Hungarian? Just say, "Yes, ma'am, yes, sir." Hurry up. Wipe your shoes. Resi, that's an exaggeration. I told you not to argue. Help me up, Bora. The new maid, ma'am. Is it mute? Yes? You have to listen. If you steal you will be farewell, do you understand? Yes, ma'am. Well, he can talk. Maybe I can sing. Can you sing? Go ahead. Let's go. ? The lower door is built in five years. ? ? Before her, they resounded young people. ? ? At that time, it was a world to live in. Gverkom, the miners' quarter. ? ? From the tavern to the fray and from the fray to the mine. ? Bravo, like a nightingale. Continue. Good, isn't it? Resi, stop it. You're going to get fat. You're going to stay a spinster. You will stay here with me. Jancsi climbed your bed and Bora took care of your quilt. Are you afraid of mice? No. Are you already menstruating? 64 It cannot be avoided. Unless you are pregnant. But I don't know if that's a relief. How many were in your house? First, just me and my mom. Then he got married so that they would not say in ?tiavnica that was prostituted. The widower brought his children, three of them. Mom is now waiting for her family. You're a mama's girl, aren't you? Remember what you dream. That which you dream of in the new home, it will become a reality. Stefan, come and eat. Let me see you. Be kind. No one wants a sad maid. The high bourgeoisie does not lower the stairs. Look under your feet. I turn around and the cat is over the table. You should have drowned him. This is our Krist?na, the cook. Kitchen. That's what the cook does. Has your mother of you, you bastard? Kochi Jancsi and Mr. Istv?n. They work in the garden and in the house. - Stefan, with Istv?n. - Fuck you. It doesn't hurt so much anymore. I think it numbed her. Krist?na, you are the best cook of all Prague, I swear. Just don't choke. Come to my room sometime. We'll have a good time, won't we? They are awake. Shall we go? Gracious and protective Jesus, be with the Father Thy highest honor. And to the Spirit who rejoices us at all times forever. - Amen. - Amen. Go. Let's go. Let's go! The laundry. What is dripping goes to one side. Do not mix the pillows of the Mr. and Mrs., it would be a sin. They are perfumed and have an embroidered label. This is where we wash and we make soap. Soap should be saved, not to waste it. Don't smell of bleach all Fridays. Continued. Put some lavender or moths will eat it. - What's up? - Nothing. The lady sees every stain. You have to polish them well. Serve in silence, be like a mouse. She's Bora, she's stuck up. I wanted to be a cook, but Krist?na cooks better. Always ventilate. After a night of party everything is a problem. You have waste. You need vinegar and oil. What are you doing? You have to hold this potty like a vase of flowers. They should not think that their shit smells like ours. L?za? L?za. - Shall we wash today? - Not until Friday. - Well, we will do it today. - Yes, ma'am. I can never do it alone. This way you don't shit yourself. "I can do it alone." The lady wants the toilet inside and Mr. says no, that the shit must be out. - Blessed be the Lord Jesus Christ. - Forever and ever. Anka? What do you have here? Stefan is playing with you. Lo does with anyone who will let it. Even with Krist?na? Silly. Krist?na does not know sleeps with no one. She is still a virgin, probably forever. Who would want it no tits and no ass? The young woman snores until nine. He makes a fool of himself. When you are not snoring, you are giving turn around and read or not even that. He imagines a prince on a white horse coming to look for her. How do you know all that, L?za? - You're just... - A maid? Finally, it's time to play. Enter. Good morning. Where is my brooch? I had it here. Did you steal it? Confess or I will call the police. Show me your hands. Take off your apron. Take off your clothes. Here it was. I had forgotten about it. What are you doing there? stop? Out of here. Glory to the Father, to the Son and the Holy Spirit, as at the beginning, now and forever. God, may mom have health, as well as his family. And the Emperor. Amen. You haven't told me what you dreamed the first night. Anka! L?za is going to give me a pin, I'm going to nail this one cockroach on the wall. - Good appetite. - Good appetite. Please. Thank you. The spoon is in the right hand. Elbows. - How you are sitting. - How am I sitting? I will have them bring a mirror so you can see yourself. It's hard, you can't eat it. Leave the hard stuff aside. L?za, bring the books. No need for that. I'm sitting upright. You are not. Those two, come on. Nothing helps you, I can tell you whatever I want. - Is it tasty? - Yes. Resi, imagine Austria-Hungary as our home. Solid, 171 quality, and indestructible. And you as Emperor? Well, my kids, you and mom as the most important ministries of the empire. Books are schools. And the paintings? Paintings and jewelry are cultural heritage. Cities are rooms and the The garden is the Alps. What about the kitchen? The kitchen is a warehouse of material reserves. And the fence is the border. Do you see that you do understand? Go. So when your mother you to do something, it is 183 as if the Emperor wanted to approve a new law. At first glance, we limited, but in... Resi, it's a system. The system in which we live. Where is my pipe? Here, sir. I realize it right away if anything is needed. I will do anything that wish to see their eyes. My goodness. That won't work even if cut your hands. It is necessary to adapt. Let Anka taste the lemon. Lemon is expensive. The water must be cold or it will shrink. Don't cry. You are not even the first nor the last maid. Being a maid is not the worst thing that can happen to you. Look who's talking, Krist?na. They don't chase you everywhere, no one tells you that nothing works, that you are incompetent and stupid. Dumb? Let me tell you something. The mansion does not have secrets for the servants. We know all about them. You, me, Stefan, L?za. We know what they eat, what they drink, when they go to bed. And who they sleep with. We know who comes to visit them. We know when they bleed, when they are sick. What they write and to whom. But they know nothing about us. Your secret will remain yours. So tell me, who is really a fool. Why so early? Can't sleep? You were at thinking of a boy, right? Do you have a boyfriend? Cute, isn't it? It is called French garden. It was invented by the French. They like it that way. Who did you leave at home? To Mom. No man? There were twelve of us at home, like the apostles. My brother went to the USA and shat on us. I said I was going to Prague already that we are a monarchy. Although the boys insulted him. He said that the Emperor was an old man. who fell asleep in his time. Can you read? "Milan Stefanik, a native of Slovakia. She studied astronomy at the Karl-Ferdinand University. Currently an observer and scientist in Paris. The photo below was taken during the ascent to the alpine mountain Mont Blanc, the highest in the European continent. Why did you go there? It is very tall. He probably wanted to throw a glimpse from that location. I would also take a look. For you. I have clothes on the stairs. Are you made of sugar? They arrived. - Burn them. - Yes. Anka, come on. We have to clean their shoes. Welcome. - Good. - Hello, sir. - What do you have there? - Mom! - Clean it yourself. - No. By the stairs? - How many steps are there? - One thousand. This way. It is beautiful. Son of a retired postal employee and a mother of ill repute. Is it a match for our only daughter? Why? Why him? Why not Johann that has 5,000 acres of land? Or Dolf who has a house in front of the Hofburg? - Can I take sugar? - Don't grab it, you'll burn yourself. What a visit! Finally. Welcome. - You look younger and younger. - Not me, you. Please sit down. A charming personality. My daughter Resi. Resi, play something for Gustav. Don't be shy. Our Resi. Practice every day. Apparently so did his son. Beautiful view of those two, don't you think? You will look like a princess. A little more. Anka, help me, you have stronger hands. Yes, ma'am. To. Exhale and hold your breath. I told you not to breathe. Let me see. Everyone will be watching you. What do you have? Thank you, Anka. - Thank you. - Good. This is no longer sustainable. Austria-Hungary is the State largest in Europe. 53 million inhabitants that speak a myriad of languages. But you are forgetting Russia, sir. But Russia is not Europe. What will happen if an archduke like the future Francis II, really transforms the austro-hungarian monarchy. in the united states federations of Greater Austria. after departure of the Emperor? I wouldn't talk about the march of the Emperor not even theoretically. You are 84 years old, sir. D'Este really intends to eliminate state dualism. Nonsense. Another drink. What are you doing, L?za? 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... How long will to shout those idiots? They deserve to be killed. Was anything stolen? I would not be surprised. Can I eat this, Krist?na? I am starving. And you, do you have little work? What is that? nonsense you are reading again? Beautiful. She is the maiden of the the viceroy fell in love. They are all fairy tales. What do you know? Nobody has ever looked at you. The spinster is envious. Now I don't know how it will end. Wrong, always wrong, L?za. I know that. Someday someone will will write about me. You will see. The press will write about me in the newspaper. Crap. I'm not going back there. I'm going to sleep. I have to wait. I will continue to hand them out. It is wrong. Do you want to? I asked your father to ask me will let me talk to you alone. Where will you live after the marriage, Miss Resi? Here. Dad wants you to we stay here. There is plenty of room. Now that Gustav is here, the will finally stop giving me orders. And Mr. Gustav will Do you like it, Miss Resi? What about you? He is like the master. It is said that every woman chooses her husband resembling her father. Don't you? I have no father. What is sex like? Have you done it before? With a boy? Come here. Greetings to the lady, Mura. Anka? What will Gustav do with me tomorrow? What all men do. But what will it be like? Couldn't you find out? Then you come and tell me about it, okay? Stefan. Well, do what you have to do. Not yet. Can be supported. Really? With one or two is over. Let me see. Good morning, Jancsi. You must have been dreaming something very nice. You are who you dreamed of, I didn't sleep much. Fox. Will I be able to breathe? Can you make the dress a little shorter? No, that's fine. Okay, it's fine. Anka, keep it. Very good, ma'am. It was nothing. Resi. How nice. The veil, guys. Thank you. - You will call me father. - I can't do that, sir. - Father. - Father. Don't argue, be nice with him and keeps smiling. Do you know who laughs for no reason, mother? Don't apologize. The men do not want weak women. It's after the wedding, so I guess it doesn't matter anymore, does it? You'll know the first time to get your ass kicked. We arrived. Let's go. Goodbye. Good luck. Take care. Stefanik, is the one who climbed the mountain. Now it will go to sea as Miss Resi. Kristina, will you return Mrs. Resi? Why wouldn't I come back? Wait. Good. - Is that how they dress over there? - Here in this country. Wait until d'Este is emperor, will drive all Germans out of Prague. Where far away? Back home. We are the only ones that we are at home. I thought the man was at home here in Prague. The gentleman is German. Mrs. Grandmother and the two boys. Even your Resi is German. We are the only locals at home. - The two of us? - Yes. You'll see, it won't stay not a single German. Krist?na, how do you know these things? How come you don't? Did you put the heating on? It is very cold. I'm sure they forgot to put it in. The Slovaks built everything Budapest. You should have gone there. - How many trees are left? - Thousand. - How much? - Back! Krist?na, as in every Christmas. Steak and salad, pike-perch, rabbit in cream sauce and for dessert corn cream with apples and raisins. And topped with cherry liqueur. The gentleman loves it very much. And the soup? Mr. does not want a tent. Let's hope he survives for this time to the tent. I will not eat carp. Yes, you will. I beg your pardon? What about heating? Is anyone going to turn on the heat? You are so cheerful, L?za. I like cheerful girls. I like to laugh. Sometimes I laugh all day long. I'm ticklish. Where else are you ticklish? The lord will buy me a house. It's small, but I don't mind it. Will come to my house and no one will know. It will ensure that you do not have to serve, I'll just wait for him to come. Will you come to visit me? We are going to have fun. Get moving. Imagine someone. To Mr. To Stefan. Why do you do that, L?za? You are so... What? So pretty. Good morning. They are coming. - Honey, how have you been? - Hi, Mom. You haven't changed a bit. And what should it look like? - Miss Resi. - Miss Resi, Krist?na. Madam, I will prepare something for you. Had it not been for the unfortunate plebiscite of 1960, Venice would remain ours, not Italy's. We need to talk. When are you going to see me again? Is it straight? No! No, Gustav. Why? I will do it. You are late. - Excuse me, sir. - What did you call me? - No, Father. - We can leave now. Why aren't you pregnant? Three months at sea and nothing? Did you sleep together? What do you think? Resi, you are no longer a child. You are now a married woman. When you are pregnant, you will have free time of your marital obligations. Maybe for a year. Tell Krist?na to prepare a fertility potion. It will be for the newspaper. Take this to him. Put it in water, let it settle for a few minutes. half an hour and you will grow a baby. Is it the Virgin Mary? Will have a baby if Gustav sleeps with her, doesn't he? No one has given birth after tea. You lied to me. It was different from what you said. It was as I showed you. Did you miss me? Every day. Every day? How is it now that it is a lady, Miss Resi? Sometimes, when it rained, wanted to go out on the street. To get wet, you know? To stop feeling it. I still felt it. Even when he was not or had gone to the port. I could still smell it. It has hardly rained here. Keep caressing me. Damn it. Why are you crying, Anka? 478 You didn't know them. You didn't know heir or mistress. I prepare the brains Znojmo style, as my mother taught me. She was shot in the neck and blood came out a meter away. And his wife in the stomach, right here. Stefan. The car was covered in blood. He is finished, poor d'Este. What was he doing there? He must have been sitting at home. No one would have shot there. Onions. No one would take me to Serbia even if I was invited. Why would they invite you, Krist?na? The gentleman said he would be ready in two to three months. It will soon be over, you'll see. Three months? Enough. He doesn't know anything. You will not wear a uniform. The most handsome man is a soldier in uniform. What do you do with it? We will defeat them, Father. This ridiculous war cannot last long. And the assassination is the real reason, or just an excuse for men to adults play at being soldiers? It's not a woman's job married to meddle in such matters. And for a single woman? Don't get involved in of men, Resi. Burn it, Rosa. L?za... Mr. L?za. Jancsi says the war will end in six months. Stefan says that in this year. Because everyone is against us. The Russians, the French and... All. My father says that Austria-Hungary is eternal, that will last a thousand years and that everyone envies us. The French have no king, English is just for show and Russia is a hundred years behind the times. And that everyone envies us. It should not. But it's nice, isn't it? Come, I'll show you something. What is your home like, Anka? What is life like there? Bonita. We will go one day, won't we? Together? Just the two of us. Yes. And we will live there together. I will show you the city. And Calvary. In summer we will go swimming. And in autumn we pick plums, we will cook dulce de leche. We will live. I hope you will also call Gustav. - What are you doing? - No one is watching. They already called me. They will also call Mr. Gustav. Maybe they are together. And if I am killed, will I will you regret it, Anka? - Why would they kill you? - They kill everybody. Perhaps only one in two. You may not, but Mr. Gustav does. Would you like that? What would women do without men? There must be one left. They could do without us. I have good news. My gallbladder was disturbing last night. We are going to have a child. In the end. Or a daughter. Look, the herbs will help you helped. They help everyone. The main thing is that the child is healthy. What? I don't hear anything. She's pregnant, Mom. We will start a new chapter in our family history. Your granddaughter. Resi is pregnant. We will have a baby. Just the two of them. It will be ours. Make it a girl. Father! I was summoned! I will go to war! Yes! War! War! War! War! War! War! What if Gustav is killed? It would be fate. Never in my life have I ever seen a woman who dresses like a man. Maybe yes, just maybe you did not recognize her. Although Gustav's shoes may be a bit too big for you. Mine are fine. Oh, my God! Breathe. Breathe, Resi. No. It is amniotic fluid, Miss Resi, let's go. - Help Resi, Krist?na. - Miss, come to bed. It's all right. I will check it out. In the morning. You will have a baby in the morning, Miss. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses... God, what kind of antichrist is she? It is God's punishment. I do not I wouldn't want that for the world. I advise you to do the same, Anka. It's already dark, Krist?na. Why hasn't the baby still? Sometimes it happens. What is it? The mother dies. Or sometimes the child. Sometimes both. Our Father who art in the heavens, hallowed be Thy name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done. will on earth as it is in heaven. - Mrs. - What's up? Do we need to call the doctor? More like a priest. Don't die, Resi. What if you are already a widow? Try one more time. Bid a little more. Once again. Again! Resi, now! Bidding! Slowly. Take a breath of fresh air. now! Yes. Come on, now. Let's go. Mommy, boys! Resi had a son! Mom, he did it! Yes. What a pity. It can happen. Very good. I will write to Gustav that next time it will be a boy. Mom... Can Anka be from adoptive mother? Shall I close the door to that does not bother you? She never stops crying. Children cry. But all the time? It is beautiful. He has not smiled once. Other children laugh. There will be time. You will, Miss. I really do. Good. Gustav is going to want a child. He will start coming to me again. I saw our Emperor Franz Josef. 626 It is very old. It is about a hundred years old. He did not see me. You will never know if I am good or not. What if you never do I get to like it? What if I don't come to love her? I love her. Anka... Can it be arranged that Gustav dies in the war? What are you doing here? What? Go to work. The child is crying again. That little girl was brought by the devil. Fuck the war. Go do your thing. Kristina, is it possible make someone die? That is with black magic. Do you want your soul becomes dark? Do you want to get caught or me for giving you advice? I don't want you to end up like our old Cyr?nicka. When I was young, cut off all the hair on his the crotch, burned it, mixed in Full Moon the ashes with water in the urinal, he drank it, then climbed onto a broom, walked around the room ten times and shouted, "Die, die, die!" And after a month the old man was dead. - Good. - Anka! Then you'd better not tell me. - But she had to be naked. -Anka, come here! Stop or it will not work. Die, die! Die! Die, die! Die, die! Die, die! Die, die! We solved it. There is nothing in any store. Everything is empty. You are still the best cook, Krist?na. The best in Prague, I swear. It is obvious that you are eating shit at the front. They were eating without butter and no sugar. It is not necessary. Burn it, Krist?na. Let me tell you that we are on the side wrong. In the wrong trench. - Which trench is the good one? - Across the street. Just across the street. Anka, look. Read. "Czech and Slovak brothers, The Germans and Austrians want to to dominate the world and enslave Europe. They must be confronted and fight for our freedom." Stefanik. Emptied the bag of it while flying. There was a field full of papers. We all hid it. - Shut up. - What are you afraid of, Krist?na? You only talk about the war. Don't you know of anything else? There is a lot of resistance. People from Prague, some Slovaks as well. Something has to be done. Not doing enough? Keep it. Stefan! Wait. Each soldier has a memory of his girlfriend. We both know how that's the way it is, Anka. Are you coming? Goodbye, Jancsi. What does it really do a nobleman like your father? Feeds us. To Grandma, to Mom, to you and me. To the whole house. What is written on the letters that Kristina burns? - State secrets. - Does the master have a secret? We all have secrets. Dad, the Emperor, we too, don't we? Where did you get it? It was given to me by Stefan from his brother. It appeared in the newspapers. He pilots an airplane and throws papers. It's just making a mess. I wonder who will clean it. A woman can go crazy, a man can fuck a fart and it's in the papers. Sit down. Resi! Resi! I have some bad news. The heart of the monarchy is badly wounded. Today, Your Majesty Imperial passed away peacefully. Pray for your husband. Do you think it was my fault? That I called his death? 711 Miss, I'm going to feed you. Burn it. L?za? Are you sick? Leave me alone. You are pregnant. Shall I take it out? Are you an angel, Kristina? That's how women want it. But God... What God? Has God given birth to something? - L?za. - What? You will take off my corset and no one will know. My mother also had me. I am also a bastard. He loved me anyway. Did he love you? Good morning, Jancsi. It has arrived. It's a piece of meat. It is already at home. If it were me, if it had been done to me, if I were a man, I would put a bullet in my head. If it were a real one. There are things I don't know they can pass up. They have to face each other. This is how you shake hands with the grim reaper. and you say, "Come on, do it! Do it!" Head on like a bull. Being crippled? Oh, my goodness. Crippled? If it were me, I would hang myself from the first tree. Who says you have to survive at all costs? Come here. Let's play. Can you cover it up? Now I will have an eye on you. Battle scars are the ornament of a man. I am the head. The head! Mother, can a soldier to be a boss? Yes. ? Good soldier. ? ? Nice soldier. ? Take the baby with you! This is my home, I can do whatever you want! - This shit is yours! - It's my house! It isn't! You're crippled! All is well. 762 You look useless! You should have died! Shut up! Why are you crying, stupid? It's not even my baby. When I cast the spell I shouldn't have laughed. I don't want to see you in Resi's quarters. You are no longer the mother adoptive mother of the child. Wait, the hand! Get a grip! If I had died, I would have arrived. a coffin with a broomstick. It would be more useful than this. Lo known in all brothels. He grew a leg. I'm not going to make a normal baby. We could have been happy without her. What's up? I am your good girl. No? You will have others, as many as you want. You will not abort them. You only lost that one man. They wrote about it. About our L?za. "The maid could not bear the weight of his sin and hanged himself. In doing so, he deprived himself of the Kingdom of Heaven." That's right. Fortunately, the Lord did not read what is in the newspaper. Burn it. Anka, I have something for you. Did they write to you from home? Fuck, pig. Damn you! Stand up! - Idiot, get up, don't fall down! - Don't hit me! Do it! I swear I will kick you! Help me, help me. You won't remember anything tomorrow. He wet himself. I'm going to hell. Damn job. Anka, when will we go climb the ?tiavnica? Tomorrow. Pick up the child and off we go. We will run away, don't we will tell anyone. I have no money. I will work. We will have a good time. Just the two of them and the child. At night. 1:00 am. I never sleep at night, L?za. Never. Neither the first night or any other night. Now I dream, L?za. This is like a dream. Divorce, did you know? What am I going to do without you? That's enough! That's enough! - Let me go! Enough! - Don't go away! For God's sake! I will commit suicide! We are here now. Here is Vienna. Austria. And where is Znojmo? Znojmo? In Czechoslovakia. - And T???n? - T???n? In Poland. And B?k?scsaba? In Hungary. - And An?ina ?tiavnica? - In Bansk? ?tiavnica. Where are you going? Home. My mother was widowed. Her husband died in the mine. If you want, I'll take me the lady with me. No! Yes, the child will get used to it. No, Gustav. No! We will send you money every month. No. - Take care of her. - Agreed. - We cannot do it. - No, Gustav. No! - Yes. - No! No! We will forget everything and we will start all over again. - No! - We will have more children. You will show me the city... And the forest. And your house, Anka. In autumn, there will be plums and we will make plum pudding. We shall live. Will you wait for me? Will you wait for me, Anka? Stop, Jancsi! Stop! Wait for me. Don't worry, Miss Resi. I don't care if it's different. I'll tell them it's mine, that I gave birth to a bastard. What's new at home? while I was away? Stefanik died. He who flies high, falls deep. I will show you the city. The Calvary. We'll be together, Resi. Both of them. As long as we want. 862 I will be with you to always if you want to. Anna Muran??kov? cared for the. lady until her death. and never left Bansk? ?tiavnica. He never saw his Resi again. Died in 1986.
