In this term, you will be assessed on an original research project. You will work with the person next to you on the topic of your choosing. See you next week, partner. This totally proves extraterrestrials seeded life on Earth. Why Earth? Why not Mars or Saturn? Because of the Goldilocks zone. - That's a "bear" faced lie. - That's a dollar. Hey guys. Hey Jake. Hey guys, look, another sighting. Truth.wiki again Charles, really? More like the wackopedia. Charles, let's be logical for a moment. If advanced beings with the ability to travel anywhere in the universe actually exist... Why would they visit Brightwood? To make sure we're not a threat, obviously. A threat? They have like warp drive and interdimensional propulsion. Yeah, we have your mom's minivan. Definitely not a threat. Hey dude, will you get out of my bag? Where are the chips, Einstein? Leave it alone. It's a Wi-Fi amplifier, idiot. Wow, that's fascinating. Can it amplify this? You're a massive nerd. I need your skills again. You really suck at this. What do you want me to change it to? I don't know, a B minus or something. Oh, come on! No waffles? This town sucks! I heard she got cancer. Who, Polly? I heard this one kid got it, and his entire family died. They had like these boils and pus... Ow, what was that for? Dude! Oh. Sorry, man. I bet you miss him, huh? Sorry. Hey Mikey, check this out! Whoo! Wall and peace! Michael Emory... It's no use running, son. Allan Farraday. Here to rescue the world from the horrors of street art? This is three, Mike. Three strikes. You got me. I give up, cuff me. Get in the car. You gonna take me in or what? I'm taking you home. No need to upset your mother today. We're all very fond of Jennifer, aren't we? Well... Your mom's a good woman. Good morning, Doris. Mrs. Mercher, how are you today? Oh doctor, I'm dying! Mm-hmm. I'm crossing over. I know I am. Reduce your caffeine intake and try to stay away from processed foods. I don't have the cancer? Uh no, Mrs. Mercher, you're suffering from migraines again. I'm gonna send you for an eye exam. - Migraines? - Mmm. Oh doctor, thank you. You really know how to put an old lady at ease. - Thank you, doctor. - Bye now. - Bye. - Bye bye. I think you have a fan there. Jennifer... I have news. They've sent someone. He finally got their attention. Two years. This is just the beginning. The investigator will be at town meeting on Saturday. Sure you're okay? Yeah. Hey Mike. Do yourself a favor and stay away from that Jonas kid. Do us both a favor and stay away from my mother. Looks like little Jakey's got a girlfriend. Police escort again. Real nice. Hey, stop it! Why do you have to be such a jerk all the time? I'm good with it. Allan. Hey, Jennifer. What a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately, it's a business call. It's Mike again. Oh. It's okay, I let him off with a final caution. Thank you. Don't thank me yet. I do what I can to keep these kids out of the system. But Mike, he is really pushing it. Okay, I'll talk to him. Oh, um... get together soon? Yeah, I'd like that. Michael Emory, you and I are gonna have a big talk. Did you hear what I said? Mike! Whatever, Jennifer. Excuse me, I'm your mother! Mike? What? What? I just had a chat with Officer Farraday, is what. Do you have something to say to me? Not really. Mike? How is Allan? If it wasn't for Allan Farraday, you'd be sitting in the slammer right now! All he wants to do is get in your-- Don't you dare finish that sentence! Whatever. Why do you care? Why do I care? I didn't raise you to be some delinquent is why. What would your father have said? I don't know. Why don't you go ask him? That's right, you can't! Mike! Jake? Come here, please! You mind telling me what this is? My report card. I gave it to you last week. That's funny 'cause this one just came in the mail. It's Charles' handiwork, I presume. You gotta hand it to him, he certainly has talent. You know you're grounded. Right? I guess. You guess right, young man. One week. If you're having trouble... you come and talk to me. You don't have Charles fashion forgeries. I miss him too. I'm sorry, mom. Don't let Mike see that. You know how he is with your dad's things. Shh. - Idiot! - Idiot! What are you guys doing here? We're going to the forest. You've gotta come with. Mom got my real report. Really? What'd she say? Could she tell them apart? Dude, she was pissed. I'm grounded. My informant confirmed the coordinates. There were sightings. Informant. Who's his informant? He means creepy Jeremy guy. Shut up, Max. Charles, I just told you I'm grounded. You totally did, but listen... I have a plan, we go there, check it out, and come straight back. We'll be an hour, tops. What if it's totally legit? We'll be rich and famous. Dude, no one makes money online. The Swedish gamer guy does. True, he made like millions. If my mom finds you guys here, I'm dead. Then hurry up and come down here, so we can go already. One hour? Totally. Okay, okay. I'm coming. So where are we going, exactly? Here. Hey Jake. What you doing? Oh, hey. Guys, this is Abbie. - Hey. - Hey. We're going to the forest. Cool. Mind if I tag along? - Sure, I guess. - No, you can't. Oh. How come? It could be dangerous or something. You might get dirty. Sounds like fun. I'll grab my bike. I don't get girls. Total aliens. From Venus. Especially pretty ones. She seems okay. Yeah? Well, she better keep up. Ready? Let's go. Guys, come on. So, what's he looking for? UFOs Charles, how much further? You said we'd be an hour. It's been like 30 minutes already. This is seriously creepy. What if we get seducted by alien? It's "abducted", moron. "Seducted"'s when you get a girlfriend. Hey, what do you call an alien with no eyes? Alens. Get it? - A, L... - That's a dollar. It's kind of a thing with us. You get fined a dollar for bad jokes. Yeah, Max owes like 100 bucks. Guys, this is totally it. Dylan, set up the cameras. Did you check the sensors? I don't wanna miss anything. Relax. They work. I think I dropped some candy. Ugh. Man, gross! Hey, look. Wow, it's really beautiful. Do they normally glow? Capillary action. I don't think that's a good idea. We'll study it for class. What if it's poisonous or something? Charles, don't touch anything. I only got enough charge for one flash. One? It's all I got. Is he always like this? Charles? He just gets like that with this UFO stuff. What's that stuff? Dunno yet. It's kinda weird, right? Max! Where are snacks? Max! I found it. - Idiot! - Idiot! Well, that proves there's no intelligent life out here. You're in deep trouble, young man. Jake, your friend Abbie's here. She says you have a project due. I thought I was grounded? You are. That's why you're doing schoolwork on a weekend. Thanks so much, Mrs. Emory. The project's not due... Come on, you gotta see this. What's with all this stuff? Take a look. Do you see that? Not really. Whoa! What is it? I'm not sure. I did some preliminaries. We need to do a chemical analysis. We what? Hey Dad. Sure. Okay. I gotta go. Maybe go from here. I can't do this stuff. Sure you can. Just follow my notes. Hey guys, what's up? I got totally busted. Guys, this is epic! I just mixed a frappuccino with fries... And it tastes like waffles! Shut up for a sec. There guys online were talking about this glowing stuff... Like the stuff you found. Maybe they were talking diodes or fiber optics. Wow, good thinking, Radio Shack. Wait, they said the military's been looking for it. Like it's top secret or something. Maybe it gives you super powers. Are you for real? Guys, I gotta go. I told you to stay out of Dad's room. It's mine too. He gave it to both of us. What's all this? Making love potions for your little girlfriend? She's not my girlfriend. Leave it! Come on, Jakey. Let's get a real reaction going here. - Stop it! - It's alive! - Stop it! - It's alive! Why do you have to be such a d-- Now, now. Language, Jake. Get out of my room! Chill, lover boy. Have fun with your little potions. No way. What are you? It's okay. Come on. It's okay, come on. "Magnes" Magnes. Magnus. Magnus, that's what I'll call you. Hey boy. Pleased to meet you. Come on, it's okay. Come on. Jake. Jake, wake up! Ah, look at this room. Seriously? You guys treat this place like a dump! Are you listening to me? You better have this place spotless as soon as we come home, am I clear? Okay. Sorry. Get dressed! 'Cause you're coming with me to the town meeting. Where are you? Maybe I dreamed it. Jake. Shh. Jake, gotta go. Just a minute. Now, Jake. Shh. Shh. I'm not kidding. Stay! No, stay. It's okay, I'm coming back, Jake? Coming. Jake, would you hurry up, please? Mom, I'm not feeling too well. You were fine five minutes ago. I know, I just started feeling bad. Maybe I should stay home. Also, I'm grounded, so I can't go. You go where I tell you to go. Hurry up, I'll be late! - But Mom! - In! What on earth? No, Mom, wait! I can explain! Where do you think you're going? You're in deep trouble, young man! Good morning, everyone. Good morning. I'm an epidemiologist with the EPA. I've been tasked with the investigation of a possible disease cluster here in Brightwood. Now please, everyone. I know that you want answers. And I'm here to find those answers. A couple of nights back, uh... Me and Will, we were fishing. And uh, we caught something. A monster. Ladies and gentlemen... My name is Colonel Douglas Roderick. I'm in command of operations at Fort Brightwood. The military is here to protect and serve. We are committed to working with the EPA What about the UFO? Yeah, what about that? People of Brightwood... Imagination is a wonderful thing. Don't patronize us. Some of us would love to believe in mythical monsters. This is ain't no monster, mister. We got one right here. Yeah, you see that? Yup. Right there. Gentlemen, that's a catfish. Catfish? That ain't no catfish. That one was flappin' around, changin' all kinds o' colors. It was super weird. Super weird. I'm gonna need to take that specimen away for testing. Of course, doctor. No, no wait a second. I want to sell that on eBay. eBay? Will you please call me if you see something like this again? - Dad, hey... - Hey, hey Abbie! Hey Mrs. Emory. Hey Jake. Dr. Tansy, Jennifer Emory from the clinic. Actually, we're neighbors. I'm so relieved you're actually here. Hi, Jennifer. Look, can we chat later? Ah, I gotta go. I want that room of yours spotless. Magnus. Are you kidding me? Michael Emory. This house looks like a crime scene. Where are we going? They took that thing, those fishermen caught. Why? That's what I want to know. Dad. Stay in the car. Dr. Tansy. You appear to be lost. Can I help you with something? Colonel, I think we had a little miscommunication back there. I'm gonna need that specimen. Specimen? Sorry, doctor. You'll have to be little more specific. Under the EPA Act of 1994, I have sole authority... Doctor, I'm aware of your credentials. The military will be more than happy to cooperate with all official requests. With all due respect, colonel, this is an official request. Now, I'd appreciate it if you'd hand over that specimen. You take care now, doctor. I'd hate to see anything happen to you. Or your lovely daughter. Brightwood can be a funny place. Looks like a storm's coming, Fred. What was all that about? - Dad? - Give me your phone. Why? Abbie, phone. Dad! Abigail, you promise me that you will leave your locations services on and have your phone with you at all time. Dad! Abbie, promise me! Okay, okay, I promise. Dad, seriously, what's going on? I don't know. I know one thing. That sure as hell wasn't a catfish. Food rewards or vocal commands such as "good boy." Show your pet your... Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Whoa! Hi Jake, what's up? - Where's your video? - Uh, camera's dead. Look, we're going back to the forest. You've gotta come with us. Stay! Okay, okay. Dude, chill. Charles, I gotta go. Oh, no. Um, hi. Hey. Hey. So, the science project with the weird sludge stuff. No, I can't. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What was that? What was what? Uh, the huge crash that just came from your house? Uh, nothing. Gotta go. Bye! Jake? Hello? Jake? What are you doing here? What's going on? You have to swear not to tell. Tell what? Just swear. - Listen, I... - Swear! Okay, I swear. Shh. It's okay, he wont hurt you. Whoa. What is it? Here's the thing... You know the little science experiment? I was doing the chemical analysis stuff and well... something happened. Something happened? You mean him? We gotta show my dad. - No, no, no, way! - Jake! You can't. No one can know about it. They'll take him away and they'll do tests on him. But you don't know what it is. It might be dangerous. Look at him. Does he look dangerous? He is kinda cute. Well, little guy... Looks like you just became our research project. Officer Farraday 107 to dispatch. Go ahead, 107. On site, responding to 459a. Damaged warehouses, couple of broken windows. Some damaged vehicles, looks like juveniles. Copy that. Hello. Good evening, gentlemen. What's the nature of the military presence here? We'll take it from here, officer. It's clearly a civilian matter. Mind telling me what's going on? Of course. Listen, Commander. - I'm just here trying to do my... - It's "Colonel". Excuse me? It's "Colonel". We'll take it from here, officer? Farraday. Farraday. Keep up the good work, officer. 107 to dispatch. Have we been advised of any military operations? Negative, no military assignments. This is highly irregular. A military colonel has just moved me out of my 459a. Orders just through. Advise: Stand down and vacate. Vacate? Affirmative, 107. Roger that. 107 out. Get these lights off. Where's Mom? Work, probably. Who cares? It's a holiday weekend. Aw, man! Mom's gonna be pissed. Who are they from? Farraday. You're grounded, you know. Snitches get stiches. - Hey. - Later, dork. Oh, hey. - Wow, he's grown. - I know. But I mean, he's grown a lot. I've been thinking about what he might be. I have this book on marine animals. My dad gave it to us so we could identify the fish we caught. Somehow, I don't think he's a fish. I know, but... that thing those fishermen caught had a sail fin. Like Magnus. They said it changed color and stuff. We gotta start somewhere, I guess. Hey... Hey, sit! No, sit. Hey, quit it. Hi, this is Fred Tansy. Can you put me through to Special Agent Martinez, please? Where? Okay, listen. Let him know I found something at Brightwood. Fred, it's Jennifer Emory. Please call me urgently. Fred? No, no, not at all. Is everything okay? My son in trouble again, is he? No, no, nothing like that. I don't think I could cope with that right now. Could you cope with dinner? Tomorrow night? - Say, seven? - Yeah, that'd be nice. What's with the pictures? Oh, uh... I dunno. I guess they just remind me of the old times with my dad. I just don't want things to change. What are his other characteristics? Maybe do a search for "camouflage". Sorry. Jake, he doesn't look so good. Jake. I forgot to mention something. Mention what? That. He just grew like two feet. Jake. Come here, Magnus. Jake. How do you forget to mention something like that? How big is he? 53 inches. He's gonna be huge. We got a problem. We gotta show my dad. No! You can't. You swore! Jake, at this rate by tomorrow, he won't even fit in your house. I'll move him. I'll move him to the garage. He'll be fine. Dude, you gotta see this. What are you doing here? Guys, it's okay. Calm down. He won't hurt you Holy crap! It's an alien! I mean... extraterrestrial! It's not an alien! Sit! Looks like the cat's out of the bag. Somehow, I don't think it's a cat. It's a figure of speech. I don't think it's one of those either. Guys, it's okay. Meet Magnus. That thing has a name? Listen, you can't tell anyone, okay? Are you kidding me? This is the find of the century. Charles, I'm serious. I am too. Wait till I post this. Do you ever listen, Charles? - What the hell, Jake? - Go home! - You're not filming it. - Are you kidding me? This is worth a fortune. As a friend, I'm asking you to go home. You know what, Jake? I'm not sure we really are friends. Friends tell each other things. And friends don't keep massive secrets from each other. I knew you'd do this. All you care about is your stupid channel! Well, all you care about is your stupid girlfriend! She's not my stupid girlfriend! Come on, guys, let's go. Can you believe that guy? I gotta go. Come here, Magnus. Dad, I have to tell you something. What's that? I don't know. They're gonna do an autopsy on him to find out. You mean they're gonna cut it up? Mm-hmm. But what if it wasn't dead? I guess they might observe it. Observe it? For how long? I don't know. A few days, weeks maybe. Depends on what it was. This one... They're gonna wanna analyze every inch of that one. That's a fascinating specimen. What'd you wanna tell me? Nothing. Never mind. What are you doing? That's Dad's camping bag. I told you to stay out of his stuff. Fine. Whatever. Don't go in there. Out of my way. Mike, please. Please? What are you up to? Hang on. You got your little girlfriend in there, haven't you? No! Fine, I'll just show you. Just... Please, don't freak out. Yeah, whatever. That's the big secret? A little old for the plush toys. What the hell is that thing? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? You didn't you check the invoice? I didn't buy it, you moron. It's incredible. I'm keeping him, Mike. Remember that time when... we went fishing with Dad and caught that eel? We snuck it home and put it in the bath. Yeah. Mom freaked. Right. That's no eel. I got somethin'. Yeah, you got somethin', all right. I got somethin' here... Steady. Steady. Colonel Roderick's office, please? Colonel Roderick's office. Yeah, good morning. This is Dr. Fred Tansy from the EPA. I'd like to set up a meeting with Colonel Roderick, please. Hold, please. Hello? Dr. Tansy? It's Will from the town meeting. I thought I'd drive you to school this morning We can start the day as a family. You never drive us to school. Well, today I am. I'm what? Driving us to school. Uh, we're gonna walk. You got two minutes. No arguments. We'll grab breakfast on the way. Mike, I can't leave him here. What do you want me to do about it? I don't know. You're always getting out of stuff. I'm going to the car now. You will both be in it. - Mike. - I'll think of something. Just don't just make her mad, okay? She's always mad. - Mike! - All right. Okay. This breakfast thing... Can we just skip breakfast thing? Can we please not have an argument today? Who's arguing? I'm just saying this isn't the best day for it. Actually, Mike, today is the perfect day for it. What does that mean? I just think it's time we all moved on. This is about Farraday, isn't it? He asked you out again. Yes, he did. And I intend to go. Tonight, actually. Come on, guys, it's been two years. Two years is too soon to replace Dad. I'm not replacing Dad. No one will ever replace him. Don't I deserve some happiness? Not with some glorified hall monitor. That's enough. Allan's given you plenty of chances. It's about time you gave him a chance. You know what, Jennifer? I don't need to give him jack. Don't call me Jennifer. I'm your mother. You're not my mother. You're just some douchebag's girlfriend. Get out! You too. That was mean, Mike. I told you not to make her mad. You want to go back home to that thing of yours, don't you? Don't worry. I'll make it up to her. Over there, keep looking! Colonel? What can I do for you, doctor? Well, first of all, you can stop jerkin' me around. Now, where's Will Spencer? Sorry, doctor. I'm in the middle of a military training exercise. Colonel. Check again! Well, something stinks here and it's not a catfish. Thanks for the house call, doctor. Watch him. Find out what he knows. Magnus? It's me, boy. What's up, boy? 107 to dispatch. Go ahead, 107. Mike. Just checking that 10-70 on Hargray Street. Copy that. Relax. It's Farraday. Follow me. Abbie! Magnus, it's okay. I'm right here. - Jake! - Sit! It's okay, it's me. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. That thing is dangerous. It has to go. He just needs more training. I just did not train him properly. Jake, whatever that thing is... It's turning wild. He belongs here. He needs me. Look at her wrist. - He didn't mean it. - Seriously? How long do you think you can keep him hidden for? Stay here. I'm gonna go grab a bandage. You okay? Yeah. Sorry about what I said before. To Charles, I mean. Its fine. I didn't mean it. - I mean... - Which part? The "girlfriend" part? - Or the "stupid" part? - You're not stupid. Look, anyway, I'm sorry. Are we good? Mike! What are you doing, son? I'm not your son. You know what? You're absolutely right. Why don't I just give your mom a call. What do you say? Go ahead. Put her in the mood for your big date tonight. Magnus. Shh. Look. If I do a search, and I find something I shouldn't, things are gonna get very complicated. - Listen up, Farraday... - Almost finished. Just one more coat and it's done. Oh. Hello, officer. Mind telling me what the two of you are doing out of school? Certainly. Mike's making a present for Jennifer. It's her 40th tomorrow. He was running behind, so, I offered to help. With everything she's been through, I just think it's so thoughtful of him. Don't you? So, it's her birthday tomorrow? Huh. Come in, 107. We have a 451 in progress. Roger that. On my way. I suggest... you clean that cut. And then the both of you get back to school. OMG, guys, look! Another sighting! This is right near us. We gotta check it out. Uh, Charles... No. Guys, seriously. This is really close. You think? Oh my gosh! Did guys just see that? Are you guys ready? How can anyone be ready for this? Are you kidding me? I was born ready. Nah, I'm pretty sure you were born naked, screaming and unable to read. Shut up, Max. Let's go! This is batch 27, boys. No one enters. No one leaves. Nothing gets out. Guys, come on. I don't think this is a good idea. Yeah, what he said. Relax, its abandoned. Guys... - Shh. - You shh. Ugh. Pooper. Max. Guys, look! Oh my gosh, I told you. They're totally real. - This is Charles Altman. - Hey! I told you this wasn't a good idea. Shut up and run. We're all gonna die. I love candy. Max, come on, hurry up! What are you doing? Get out. I told you to leave that stuff alone. I'm not leaving him, Mike. He needs me. - I'm taking him away. - Away? Away where? Where do you think you can hide him? I'm taking him to the tunnel. The tunnel. What? So, you're gonna go live out in the wild with it? Yeah, good plan, Jake. I see you've really thought this through. I'm staying with him and you can't stop me. That thing is dangerous. You saw what he did to Abbie. Who's gonna be there when he goes Jekyll and Hyde on you? He won't do that to me. He'd never do that. You can't control it. Wake up! He needs me. I made him. He's my responsibility. I'm never going to leave him. Report. We've secured the area. Stephens and Robbs reported kids. We found this. This is the find of the century Charles, I'm serious. I am too. Wait till I post this. Are you okay? Dude, we've got to get him to the mother ship. What are you doing here? They were everywhere. - What? - Aliens. What are you talking about? The military were trying to capture them. But the UFOs just kept beaming them up. I'm not convinced of your teleportation theory. It's totally legit. I think I killed one with candy. Jake! Ah, crap! We come in peace. You gonna move it, you gotta go now. I'm coming with you. Magnus, stay. I think we'll go just in case the UFOs return... I'm gonna go with them. Magnus... Step aside. Excuse me? I said, step aside. And I said, excuse me. I don't know who you think you are, but... I know my rights. Your rights? Let me tell you about your rights. You have the right to remain very, very silent. Anything you say, can and will makes piss me off. Knowing and understanding these rights, will protect you from any unnecessary pain and suffering. All clear. Where is it? What is that? Charles was right. What's wrong, boy? Magnus, stop. Charles, you were right! Jake. You were right about the UFOs. There's one right in front of us. See? In front of you? There's one right here! Jake, you've got to get out there now. What? They're drones. They're military drones. Jake, run! Jake, come on. Darn it, Magnus. Where are you? Jake. Good boy, Magnus. Abbie? Wow, it looks like stars inside. Glow worms. They're like him. Magnus, look. It's okay. You'll be safe here, boy. You'll be safe here, okay? You'll be safe here, boy. I'm right here. It's okay. Shh. I'm right here. Stay. You'll be safe. It's okay. I'm right here. Here you go. You'll be safe, okay? You gotta stay now. Come on. Let's go home. There were four beds in that room and they've all been slept in as well. I mean does anybody clean here? I was kinda surprised you asked me out again. Really? I mean, I hoped you would. I thought I might've scared you off. I mean, Mike... No. No, kids in this town have got it tough. You know, there's only two options. Military or mischief. I've been that kid. Would we like dessert? Uh, I'll just have coffee, thanks. Okay. I organized a little surprise for you. Um, I wanted to get in early, so... Uh, happy 40th birthday! Oh, uh... Ah, Allan... I'm really flattered. But it's not my birthday. They're gonna kill him. There, at the old substation. Hold position! Leave him alone! Magnus, it's me! OMG, I gotta film this! Isn't that Jake? I'm right here! - Right here. - Jake! Mom, it's okay. Sit. Drop. Sorry. Get the kid outta there! End it! No! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Sorry! Wrap it up. I'll take Abbie home. Charles, this is not the time. Charles, will you quit... Easy, people! He's coming around. Let's get him secured. Put him on ice. Dad? Dad! Farraday 107 to dispatch. We have a 207 here. Proceed. I need back up. Negative, 141. We are in lockdown. What? Initiating curfew. On whose authority? Order comes from military HQ. Roderick. Do you have it? Building 6. Negative 202.130.2 What is going on? Well, Mike, looks like you've finally made something of yourself. Guys, I'm speaking to you. This is delicious, Mrs. Emory. Where did you get this picture? Yearbook photo. You sure this will get us on base? Get you on base? You guys aren't going anywhere near that base. Mom, we got this. You most certainly have not got this. Don't worry, Mrs. Emory, I brought insurance. These babies will be streaming live the whole time. Check it out! All comms are out, so I set up a close-circuit Wi-Fi relay to bypass the phone carriers. You guys, this is ridiculous! I know, they don't even have snacks. Mom, listen, call as many people as you can and tell them to tune in to Charles' channel. Jake, there's no way I'm gonna let you do this... Mom, just listen. - Are you okay? - They've taken Fred. - What? - This has gone too far. I'm going to Fort Brightwood to bring him back. We all are. No, you kids are not going anywhere. For years, all you've talked about is how the military have done something to us. How they did something to Dad. Jake, there's no way I'm gonna let you do this. Mom, just let him talk. They took my friend. Now they've taken Abbie's dad. They've taken enough. It's time for us to do something. Hey guys... I understand that you want to help. I get it. - But I can't allow you... - Allow? Once you set foot on Fort Brightwood, you have zero authority. We're going with you. Allow us to or not. Allan, I don't want you to go. Can't someone else handle this? There is no one else. Roderick's got the entire force locked out. I gotta go. Time is critical. Keep these kids out of trouble. Is there any point in me telling you that what you're planning here is both illegal and dangerous? Not a chance. Danger's my middle name. No, it's not. It's Francis. Get in. Whoa. I know. Imported. Where'd you get it? I borrowed it. Borrowed? Law and justice don't always tread the same path, Mike. We'll have it back in the impound by morning. The police impound? That place is like a fort! So I've heard. Yeah, well, growing up in a tough town you tend to acquire certain skills. So I've heard. I can't see! The camera's not on yet. I know, genius. My helmet's too big. Use this. You'd better not lose it. What if this doesn't work? Do not worry, it'll work. So, Charles, where'd you get the ID template? - My informant. - Who says "informant"? That's what I said. It's probably some guy's library. Do not be stupid. Nobody uses the library anymore. I got it from truth.wiki. Oh. We are so screwed. Everybody quiet. We're here. What's the cargo? Biological materials. You wanna open her up? See that symbol there, buddy? Go ahead. But it's your funeral. Biohazard symbol. Good thinking. I don't think he's buying the ID. Stay calm.

He's cold-blooded. We just need to warm him up. Lights, we need lights. Dad? He should be here. Do not worry. We'll find him. He could be anywhere. Crap. Quick, Charles, go to... No, no, no! What the? Stupid antenna! Come on, we gotta go now. No, wait, he'll warm up. Come on, boy, get up! Jake, we're out of time. Hey, I found a map. It's a map of the building. Is there a cell block on there? Kitchen, com center, a bunch of interview rooms. Bingo! What is it? Evidence. Goggles, come in, goggles. I'm totally offline. Quit calling me that. I'm coming. The antenna moved again. Didn't you check this stuff? I just built a closed network out of a roll of tape and a can of chips. Give me a break. Come on, we have to go now.

Oh, I'm not gonna kill him. Not yet. Where are the boys? - Uh... - Where are they? Charles, come in! OMG, we just hit 223,000 views. Shut up about your channel. We need eyes on Building 6. How about you start by telling me exactly how you made... him? Don't tell him anything, Jake. Leave him alone! Then tell me how you made it. I can't remember. You can't remember. - Open it up! - No! Then tell me how you made it! Somewhere in that little head of yours is the answer. And one way or another, I will get it out of you. Lock 'em up! No, no, wait, I... I remember. Magnesium. Hydrogen. Sodium. Sodium bicarbonate. There must be something else! Uh, protein shake. I spilled a protein shake. A protein shake. Two years of R&D and the stabilizing element is a protein shake. A simple enzyme. We have what we need. Destroy it. No! OMG, did you just see that? We just hit 900,000 views. Come on, boy! They don't leave the base. Stay with him! Whoa, whoa, here. Take it out!

Colonel Roderick. You're under arrest for kidnapping and conspiracy. You have the right to... Officer, you're out of your jurisdiction. And way out of your depth. It's a case of your word against the government. That's where you're wrong. It's your word against the government. You wanna prosecute me? Take a shot. What I do here saves lives. Your lives. While you sleep at night. Safe and warm in your little beds. I protect you from monsters. Real monsters. Monsters that would devour the very freedoms you take for granted. You're the monster, Roderick. You've endangered the lives of everyone in this town. Endangered? Maybe. Freedom always has its price. The price you morons at the EPA will never understand. War is a numbers game. Peace is a numbers game. A hundred lost, a million saved. 126, you maniac! 126 fatalities in the past two years due to clear military misconduct. I may have killed 126. Hell, I'll kill hundreds more to get my work into the field. As I said, it's your word against the government. And here, I am the government. Wrong again, idiot. It's your word against 5.4 million viewers on my live feed. You are so screwed, buddy. This was the scene last week at a remote military installation. Where one Colonel Douglas Roderick was arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit acts of biological terror. Authorities are crediting a bunch of local children with the discovery of crucial evidence in what appears to be an on-going investigation. And in other news, residents in the nearby town of Brightwood claim to have seen monsters. No, ma'am it wasn't no catfish. I can tell you that right now. Super weird. Super weird. - What? - What? No. Oh, it's time to level. We've been through a lot, the hazmat suits. We won't talk about that. OMG, check it out! 5,200 dollars! This is awesome! We're rich! Jake, Abbie's here too. Coming. Hey, Charles, I gotta go. See you later? Totally. We're going to the forest. Bring Abbie. Cool. Magnus? Is it you? Sit.
