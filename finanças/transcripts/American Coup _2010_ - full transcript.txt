[music] In August of 1953 Iran had a democratic government. Its parliament and prime minister, the popular Mohammad Mosaddegh, had nationalized the oil industry to control the country's chief asset. Then, the CIA intervened. [music] [music] [music] [music] I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo. [Applause and Cheering] We meet at a time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world. Tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate. For many years Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country and there is, in fact, a tumultuous history between us. Since the Islamic revolution Iran has played a role in acts of hostage taking and violence against US troops and civilians. In the middle of the Cold War the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. This history is well known. I have never heard anything about the CIA, especially in 1953. I don't know anything about it. I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that. I have no knowledge of that whatsoever. Something I've never heard of, never known anything about. I have no clue. Uh... Uh... Uh... can you repeat that? Well I wasn't born in 1953 so I've never heard of the coup. That was a little bit before my time. After the Eisenhower administration made its decision to overthrow Mosaddegh, Allen Dulles selected Kermit Roosevelt to carry out the coup. At the beginning of august 1953 Kermit Roosevelt arrived in Tehran and began this covert operation. It's really a fascinating operation to study because it answers this odd question. How do you overthrow a government? [music] Former Premier Mosaddegh’s ruined house is a mute testimony to three days of bloody rioting culminating in a military coup. Suppose you get sent to a country and you're told "overthrow the government" so what do you do on the first day? What do you do on the second day? In the quick shift of power, Mosaddegh was finally apprehended and awaits trial for treason. The Shah, who had fled to Rome, comes home backed by General Zedekiah, military strongman, who engineered his return to power. The general will now have a strong voice in the newly formed government whose cabinet is seen here with Shah Pahlavi. How do you overthrow a government? [music] Many countries in the Middle East are what you might call fake countries or invented countries. They're countries that were created by outside powers, usually in the wake of World War I and I think there's a temptation for people that aren't familiar with the region to see Iran in that category but that's not true. Actually the opposite is true. Iran, formerly known as Persia, is one of the world's oldest civilizations. At a time when Europeans are still living in caves and wearing animal skins people in Persia were conducting experiments in astronomy and learning about mathematics and writing beautiful poetry. So this is a civilization that has a great deal of sense of its history, a sense of self confidence, a sense of identity and a sense of being rooted in the long course of world history. This is not a country that just arrived and it is trying to figure out who or what it is. In 1908 the British discovered oil in Iran. Geologists soon learned that Iran sits on an ocean of oil. The British decided that they needed oil to run their cars, to power their Navy and to fuel their economy. But Britain has no oil. When oil was discovered there the British decided that they would like to control that entire resource. Soon after the discovery this Anglo Iranian Oil Company was formed and it purchased the majority stake and then the oil company arranged a concession with Iran. The entire stock of Iranian oil was the property of this British company and all the rights to exploit oil in Iran belonged to this company. Oil, of course, became very profitable from the 1920s onwards and the way the division was, was abysmal. For instance, Iran was getting sometimes 16 percent of the profits and the profits were defined in such a way that it actually short changed Iran. Books were not open to the public, even to the Iranian government. In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh was chosen Prime Minister of Iran. Mosaddegh was a tireless social reformer, fiercely nationalistic and incorruptible. No account of the 20th century is complete without a chapter on him. Mohammad Mosaddegh was an outstanding politician, political figure in Iran for a long, long time. He had relatives who were part of the previous dynasty, The Qajar dynasty and he was a prominent figure for a number of decades in Iran. Before he became Prime Minister in 1951 he was a vocal opponent of British control over Iran's oil industry and generally Britain's control over Iran as a country. We have to remember this is at a time when there's a wave of nationalism going through Iran. There's been long struggle against the British since the late 1800s and there was a feeling in the country that it was time for Iran to really be independent. As Iran's vast petroleum reserves aroused nationalists following seizure by the Iranian government of the British operated refineries and distribution facility. Demonstrations at the huge oil port of Ibadan culminate in the tearing down of signs over company offices and the raising of the Iranian flag over the installations. - And here comes Gossamer, a very well respected person, a lawyer, who managed to get himself in this very powerful position in the country. Mosaddegh was a fascinating figure. He must be one of the towering figures in the 20th century history of the developing world. Bear in mind that when he emerged there had never been a figure from a poor country who had risen up in such a visible way to challenge the masters of the universe. Nobody from a poor country had ever stood up and said "we own this resource, it belongs to us, it doesn't matter what companies you've imposed on us or what agreements you've imposed on us; all of that was unjust. We have this resource and we are miserably poor. We need the money from this resource and we insist on having it." Mosaddegh is very much interested in national sovereignty but there's something more than that. He's not just a national leader. He was very sincerely committed to the notion of liberal democracy. Time Magazine made Mohammad Gossamer its man of the year for 1951. They chose him over Douglas MacArthur, Harry Truman, Winston Churchill and a number of other towering world figures and they were right. He was the most important person in the world at that time. And he did what a lot of Iranians strongly agreed with, which was to make sure that Iran would keep the revenues of its own oil, at least a big portion of it, whereas in the past it didn't keep any of it. So people in Iran began challenging Anglo Iranian Oil Company and saying "you've got to change your contract with us and give us 50 percent, you keep 50 percent", not keep 90 percent or more, whatever it was, no one ever knew since Iranians were never allowed to audit the books. The Anglo Iranian Oil Company refused. They would not concede an inch. They were quite pigheaded. I think they were still maybe caught in the colonial mentality of the past and thought that the idea that some poor country could try to pressure them or dictate terms to them was unthinkable. The important thing is who actually controls oil production because if you control oil production then you can decide whether you're going to increase it or lower it and that then determines, of course, price. What Mosaddegh was doing was threatening that because by nationalizing he was saying MANIOC is not going to be in charge of production, Iran will be in charge. We can decide how much to produce, who to sell it to and that could influence the market. So that's where it became the threat. The ability of a foreign company to control oil in the Middle East was also important, not just for the British but also in the American's eyes. They didn't want other countries in the Middle East to begin thinking that all you have to do is make trouble and foreign companies are going to have to make concessions to you. The pretense was that they were willing to compromise but the Brits from right at the beginning they didn't want to give up control. They started spending some money on, you know, parks, swimming pools and stuff. So by '51 they were saying "the Iranians should be grateful to us because we've built you swimming pools and stuff." Well of course a swimming pool might cost the oil company 2,000 pounds. What's that when you know profits are like 50 million pounds a year or something like that. They were treating them kind of like the way we treated black Americans in per civil war south, or even post civil war south when we put them in economic slavery instead of real slavery and persisted, even more adamantly, in their desire to rape, pillage and plunder Iran. The Persians had every reason to dislike the way that MANIOC was treating them. The British didn't really know how to deal with a situation like this. It was a new era for them but they were still thinking in an older era. One of their first impulses was"well we're going to send an army and we'll just invade Iran." Harry Truman, in Washington, got wind of this and he went crazy. You got this situation where Harry Truman, I think, says"I'm not having any of this, this is imperialism, this is colonialism. We've fought a damn war. Winston Churchill when you come back to the government you can go to hell." President Truman was increasingly concerned about the intensity of this argument between Iran and Britain. At one point he sent a leading figure in the United States, Aver ell Harridan, who had been famous as governor of New York and had held a number of international positions, to Iran with instructions to negotiate with Mosaddegh and see if he could get Mosaddegh to make some kind of a compromise with the British. I want to express to you my appreciation for your willingness to undertake this trip to Iran. It's a very important job that you have undertaken and one which I think you can handle with satisfaction and success. Mr Harridan undertakes a series of conferences with Prime Minister Mosaddegh. Out of these conferences hope emerges, that the crisis that threatens world peace may now be averted. Poor Averell Harriman was shuttling back and forth between British and Iranian representatives, trying to make a deal, and realised that neither side was willing to. The British policy was to actually undermine Mosaddegh initially by putting economic pressure. So one way of economic pressure was to try to close down the oil industry, thinking that the Iranians wouldn't be able to run the oil industry. Actually Iranians were able to run it. They kept turning up the pressure, hoping that as one official of the old British company said "when they need money they will come crawling to us on their bellies." So the next step was to have a blockade so Iran couldn't sell its oil and so whenever tankers from Italy or somewhere came to buy oil the British would actually impound them. This way the main source of revenue of course for Iran dried up because Iran's main source of foreign exchange and revenue was in fact oil. The British then decided they would take Mosaddegh to international tribunals. The first thing Britain did was to submit a resolution to the United Nations Security Council in which the Security Council would order Iran to give back the oil company. When Mosaddegh heard about this he decided to do something that no leader of any poor country had ever done. He would fly himself to New York, which wasn't so easy in those days, and personally present Iran's case to the Security Council. He made quite a splash in New York City. He went to visit the Liberty Bell, went to Washington DC. He was a very colorful figure, something like your beloved but perhaps slightly eccentric favourite uncle. His speech at the Security Council was very potent. It was the first time that most people at the UN and most people in the world had ever heard the leader of a poor country explain a clash like this from the perspective of the poor country. We'd always been hearing it from the other perspective. [music] The United Nations, once again, confronts a grave problem as Premier Mohammad Mosaddegh of Iran arrives with Secretary [Trig Hurley] at the Security Council to present his side of the explosive Iranian oil case. The ailing statesman electrifies the Council as he denies the right of the United Nations to intervene in what he calls a purely internal matter. He accuses Britain of intimidation by a display of armed might after the nationalization of the oil industry. Sir Goldwyn Ebb, Britain's representative, is an attentive listener to his arguments, as is America's Warren Austin. The issue could be peace or war. After that debate the Security Council did something that it had never done in the brief history of the UN, which was to refuse to pass a resolution that had been sponsored by one of the leading members of the Security Council, Britain. So the UN refused to order Mosaddegh to give back the oil company. Then the British decided "we're gonna take Mosaddegh to the world court in the Hague" and Mosaddegh himself flew to The Hague. Hearings before the International Court at The Hague failed to solve the difference as Premier Mosaddegh, with his parliament behind him, firmly pursued his nationalist course. The same thing happened. He had a great impact, not just on public opinion but on the judges there and those judges also refused to order him to give back the oil company. So the British were running out of options. From their point of view Iran had stolen something that belonged to Britain. It seemed like an open and shut case. "We had a contract with them. They gave us the right to own their oil. Now they want it back. But this is a contract, it cannot be violated, they signed it." The United Nations did not accept this argument; the World Court did not accept this argument. This was quite a shock for the British. The British tried to oust Mosaddegh by bribing members of Parliament. But Mosaddegh got wind of the plot, he promptly kicked the Brits out of the country. After the British Embassy in Tehran was closed the British were more or less out of options. They had tried everything from blockading ports to appeals to international bodies, threats, embargoes, everything. Now they didn't even have anyone in Iran. So they turned to the Americans. Churchill asked President Truman,"can you do us this favour? Can you overthrow this madman who has taken away our oil company?" Harry Truman, I think, was violently opposed on principle to supporting the coup and Britain worked hard to get Harry Truman to support the coup. And Truman said "no". The CIA had never overthrown a government up to that time and it was Truman's firm belief that it never should. That seemed like the end of the line for Britain. Then, in November of 1952, a surge of excitement charged through the British foreign service. In Washington, a new President had been elected - Dwight Di. Eisenhower. IKE for President. IKE for President. You like IKE. I like IKE. Everybody likes IKE for President. Hang out the banner and beat the drum. We'll take IKE to Washington. We've got to get where we are going, travel day and night for President. Let Ladling go the other way. We'll all go with Ike. You like IKE. I like IKE. Everybody likes IKE for President. Hang up the banner and beat the drum. We'll take IKE to Washington. We'll take IKE to Washington. We'll take IKE to Washington. We'll take IKE to Washington. Now is the time for all good Americans to come to the aid of their country. There was a fundamental disagreement between Truman and Eisenhower on the question of whether Mosaddegh was the problem or the solution. Truman and his Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, had for some time been working fairly closely with Mosaddegh. They had a fundamental sympathy towards Iran and its efforts to get itself out from under the influence of Great Britain. They became convinced that negotiations with Mosaddegh were the way to go. Eisenhower and his group, on the other hand, although they didn't reach this conclusion right away, were much more disposed towards finding some other solution. The British approached the incoming Republican Administration about overthrowing Mosaddegh. John Foster Dulles, the new Secretary of State, had long railed against the dangers of communism. For much of his career, he had served as a top lawyer for large mulch-national corporations. His brother Allen became the new director of the CIA. It was the first and only time that siblings controlled both the overt and covert sides of American foreign policy. It wasn't hard for the British to talk the brothers into overthrowing Mosaddegh. The Dulles brothers then sold the new president on the idea of a coup by playing the communist card. There's only one person in the whole Eisenhower administration whoever raises this question of Mosaddegh’s true beliefs and that person was President Eisenhower himself. There was a meeting of the National Security Council at which Eisenhower said something like "I'm glad we're overthrowing this communist Mosaddegh but I actually wasn't aware that he really was a communist" and Dulles had a great answer. Dulles said"well it's true that Mosaddegh is not a communist, however Mosaddegh is an elderly man, he could die, he could be overthrown. That would produce instability in Iran. There is a communist party in Iran. Iran is on the border with the Soviet Union, therefore circumstances could unfold in a way that might leave Iran open to communism." And then the straw that breaks the camel's back is"the Soviets are coming." Where have we heard this before? "The Soviets are coming, the Soviets are coming." When Eisenhower heard that he said "okay, you've convinced me." And Eisenhower approves it and it goes ahead and there's one other thing operating here. Eisenhower has this incredible aversion for war, not so counter intuitive if you think about it for a moment. He doesn't want to see a nuclear war in particular and so he develops this penchant for clandestine operations because compared to war they're cheap. After the Eisenhower administration made its decision to overthrow Mosaddegh, Allen Dulles selected Kermit Roosevelt to carry out the coup. Kermit Roosevelt was the grandson of Theodore Roosevelt. He's very well educated, my god he's a Roosevelt. He is full of energy, the energy of youth, the dynamism of youth and good education and he wants to serve his country but he wants to do it in a secretive way, he wants to do it in an adventurous way, he wants to do it overseas and so forth. - As the chief of the Middle East section of the CIA he was the logical choice. So he's the perfect person for this kind of operation. At the beginning of August, 1953 Kermit Roosevelt arrived in Tehran and began this covert operation. It's really a fascinating operation to study because it answers this odd question; how do you overthrow a government? Suppose you get sent to a country and you're told "overthrow the government" so what do you do on the first day? What do you do on the second day? Kermit Roosevelt, who really was something like a true life James Bond, carried out a very effective policy. Roosevelt bribed tribal leaders and newspaper editors who now claimed that Mosaddegh was a dictator and had to go. Every day they were printing articles about how evil Mosaddegh was, that he was a Jew, he was a homosexual, he was a criminal, he was an agent of the British; anything they could think of to undermine him. Leaving nothing to chance, Roosevelt bribed military officers, religious leaders, and members of Parliament. One of the most interesting things that Kermit Roosevelt did, besides bribing members of parliament and military officers and everyone else, was his decision to throw Tehran into chaos. He had this idea that if there were riots and outbreaks of violence every day around Tehran people would begin to think that Prime Minister Mosaddegh had completely lost control of the country. So as the coup day drew closer he bribed the chief leader of the protection rackets in Tehran, a guy named Shaman the Brainless, to turn out his mob. It was Kermit Roosevelt's idea that this gang, this mob, should charge through the streets of Tehran, beat up pedestrians, break shop windows, fire guns into mosques and then yell "up with communism, we love Mosaddegh" and that wasn't even enough. Kermit Roosevelt had an even better idea. He hired another mob to attack that mob. That created a huge outbreak of street violence. The first idea that Kermit Roosevelt had was to bring the Shah into the plot. The British had occupied Iran during the second world war, at which time they placed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on the throne as Shah or"King". Prior to doing so, they forced the Shah's father - a ruthless strongman - to abdicate the throne due to suspected pro-Nazi sympathies. In placing the son on the throne, the Brits hoped the younger, weaker Shah would be easier to control. The Shah was a great coward and a great pipsqueak and real afraid cat, very much different from the image that we had of him 20 years later. He was terrified of becoming involved in this operation because he feared, perhaps quite rightly, that if it went wrong he'd be finished, he'd be chased all out of the country. This was really dicey up to the last minute. The Shah even didn't think this was gonna work. They had to fly his sister in, for example, who was hated and didn't even wanna go, to try and convince him to do it. It took a great deal of persuasion and a lot of pressure by Kermit Roosevelt and a number of people that he brought in to persuade the Shah to join the plot. [music] Now what did Kermit Roosevelt want the Shah to do? It was his idea that the Shah should sign two orders, "firmands" they're called in Farsi. The first order dismisses Mosaddegh as Prime Minister and the second order names General Zahedi as his successor. So late one night, around midnight, one of the generals or a colonel at that time, loyal to the Shah, arrived with a few soldiers at Mosaddegh’s house, bangs on the door and when the door is opened says, "I have two orders from the Shah." Now everyone, including the Shah and Kermit Roosevelt understood what Mosaddegh’s reaction to these orders would be. He would say"these are illegal, I reject these orders. You have no right to name a new Prime Minister or to fire a Prime Minister without parliament's approval," and when he did that they would arrest him, that was the plan. That simple plan failed because Mosaddegh actually got wind of the plan so when the Shah's troops came to Mosaddegh’s home to arrest him Mosaddegh had actually more troops there waiting for them. So they arrested the Shah's kernel. The next morning Radio Tehran broadcast the news that a British plot, that's what the Iranians, naively thought it was, had been crushed. When the Shah heard this he fled the country immediately and went to Baghdad and then on to Rome. The CIA cabled Roosevelt that the situation had become too dangerous and to leave Tehran at once. Kermit Roosevelt, however, thought to himself "wait, I can still do this; I have many assets I haven't used yet. I can still get this done" and showing the resourcefulness, for which he became famous, he decided to stay on in Tehran and try, four days later, to stage another coup. For the next several days, Roosevelt played the roll of puppeteer. Throwing Tehran deeper into chaos, he had one gang take to the streets, followed by another. After Mullahs marched to denounce Mosaddegh, he had the military storm the streets. They never had any idea that there was such a person as Kermit Roosevelt, that he was operating in the basement of the US Embassy. When two Iranian agents working for the CIA got cold feet, Roosevelt made them an offer they couldn't refuse. Kermit Roosevelt produced a valise with 50,000 dollars in cash. He told them: "if you agree to continue helping me I'll give you this 50,000 dollars, and by the way, if you don't I'm gonna kill you." Considering that option they changed their mind and decided to help. Roosevelt knew that the other officers under his control hadn't been touched yet. He had Loyd Henderson, the US Ambassador deliver a message to Mosaddegh: establish law and order and clear the streets of demonstrators or the US would cease to recognize him as prime minister. Henderson falsely claimed that American lives were at risk. Mosaddegh fell for the trap and effectively disarmed himself. He ordered his supporters off the streets, and established martial law which allowed the coup plotters to gain access to needed fuel and weapons. The military officers in on the plot then rolled their tanks into Tehran - not to clear the streets of demonstrators, but to arrest Mosaddegh. At Mosaddegh's residence there was a final fire fight. Mosaddegh’s men with their 3 tanks were no match for the 36 tanks that besieged the residence, which was soon destroyed. Finally, late at night, the firing stopped. The people inside fled. Mosaddegh jumped over a back wall and disappeared. The house was looted. They brought out whatever they could find and some of Mosaddegh’s personal furnishings were actually for sale on the street. His refrigerator was sold to somebody for about 35 dollars. It was time to deliver the coup DE grace, that was the naming of Zahedi. To head up the coup, the CIA had chosen Fazlollah Zahedi who had a reputation for ruthlessness. General Zahedi had spent WWII in a British internment camp due to his connections to Nazi agents. Now General Zahedi was in the custody, essentially, of Kermit Roosevelt. Roosevelt had stashed him at a safe house near the American Embassy. So he arrived there to tell him, "everything's worked out, it's all set, you're gonna be the Prime Minister." The guy was just sitting there in his underwear waiting for news. Zahedi was brought out onto the streets and rode aboard a tank through the streets of Tehran to the radio station where he was to make his statement announcing that Mosaddegh was overthrown and, "I'm now your new Prime Minister." It was quite a festive event although there was one hitch. As he was about to make his radio speech the radio announcers decided we need some marshal music to show that Iranian patriotism has finally triumphed. So he went running off, according to this account, to the Embassy library, pulled the first, you know, record album that he could find off the shelf and immediately put this record on the turntable and the very first song that came out was The Star-Spangled Banner. So this was another kind of wink of history maybe since it actually was the Americans who were coming to power. That was quickly changed. Iranian music was put on. Zahedi made his speech, announced that the evil Mosaddegh was gone and, "I will now take over and restore Iran's greatness." The Shah was sitting at lunch in a hotel in Rome, probably thinking to himself what he was gonna do now. He had already told people he would have to look for work because he wasn't gonna be able to go back to Iran. Suddenly some news reporters burst in and handed him the news and they said, "you're back. The coup... there was another coup... it succeeded. You're back on, you're gonna be the king." He was in complete shock and, for some time, couldn't speak at all. Finally, his first words were "I knew it, they love me." Back at the US Embassy, the champagne flowed as jubilation reigned. The message the Dulles brothers took away was that they had a whole new way to shape world events. After the coup several hundred military officers were arrested, about 60 were executed. There was a purge of all officers who were deemed loyal to the democratic government and not loyal to Zahedi or the Shah. It was a way of cleansing the army and doing something that Mosaddegh had refused to do, which is build an army loyal to the people in power at that moment. For his part in the coup, Zahedi was paid 5 million dollars by the CIA. The oil industry was denationalized. An international consortium was formed with 40 percent of the shares now going to American companies. Profits were split with Iran on a 50/50 basis. But the British effectively retained overall control, and its oil company renamed itself British Petroleum. Three months after the coup, Mosaddegh was tried in a military court on trumped-up chargers of treason. His fiery defense electrified the courtroom and is still remembered today. [applause] Well the McCarthy era was a dark time in the United States. This was from about 1950 to '54 thereabouts when McCarthy was on the scene and he both was created by and came to symbolize this period of absolute fear of communism, excessive fear, hysteria, as it's often called. I intend to go into those States and give the American people the cold documented picture of the sell-out in Korea, the extent to which communism has been directing our foreign policy, our suicidal foreign policy if you please. It was a time that created pressures against different American administrations, presidential administrations, to move their policies to the right. John Foster Dulles was one of the big proponents of rollback of communism under the Eisenhower administration. He had been, for a long time, an outspoken critic of Truman's policies, about the fears of the United States being soft on communism and he is known for being a vocal advocate of pushing back hard against the communists. He later admitted that he tended to exaggerate the threat, purely because it served certain interests. I think the conclusion that the Soviets didn't have any real implementable, executable designs on Iran in '52, '53, '54, I think it's a pretty sound conclusion but on the other side of that coin an even sounder conclusion I think is that, at this time, the so-called communists, the Tutor, in Iran was indisposed to be a lackey of the Soviet Union. Basically they were an indigenous group, not a common turn group, not a group that was recruited and funded and marshaled in Moscow and sent to Iran. The ideas of communism were certainly very much opposed to Mosaddegh’s idea. You could speculate on whether circumstances might have changed over time and communist influence might have grown there. The question of communism threat is often used as a rhetorical when it's useful. So in the early part, when the oil crisis starts, the Americans keep pressuring the British to actually deal with Mosaddegh and the Americans say to the British"if you don't deal, Mosaddegh will be overthrown and the communists move in" and the British pooh-poohs this and say "there's absolutely no danger of that. We can pressure Mosaddegh as much as we want, there's no communist threat." Later on you find the British then say: "we have to get rid of Mosaddegh to stop the communist guy" and then people like Acheson are then repeating the earlier British pooh-poohing that really there's no real danger of a communist takeover. At the time, of course, you can say the discourse in the West was the communist danger. So if you want to get anything done you say that. Nowadays you can say the discourse is international terrorism and you can justify anything. But even the Dulles brothers' view that this country was very susceptible to communist takeover is something that they developed themselves and is quite dubious from historical perspective. The distortion we usually get in the conventional view of the coup is that it's part of the Cold War; it's the US/USSR rivalry that leaves the CIA to carry out the coup. I would argue that the coup's really rooted in the oil crisis, when Iran nationalized the oil company. This wasn't just a threat to the British; it was as much a threat actually to all the Western companies including the American companies because the same thing could happen to American companies in the Middle East or South America. The summer of 1953 was a turbulent time and of course very threatening and dangerous for Mosaddegh. Mosaddegh’s house should have been sacrosanct. It was not and the mob went after it. I was horrified by the bloodletting in the streets. There were tanks attacking the house, there was a lot of killing then. 300 people died in that couple of hours. I interviewed the Shah amongst a group of reporters there; me and people from United Press and he just was kind of bubbling over with glee at having been saved. I met Kermit Roosevelt for the first time after the coup. I had several discussions with him later about "do you really think now that was a good idea?" and he said, "oh yes, it gave us another 20 years or something like that." It was the most reactionary, he was obeying orders Kermit was. I think he truly believed in his mission. - The '53 coup is like a guillotine in Iran, it inaugurated a massive repression and it changed the landscape so the political situation, besides being more repressive, secular organizations like the National Front, the Etude Party, were in fact disassembled, they've dismantled. They couldn't function after '53. The '53 coup was clearly a big success for the CIA as they saw it at the time and it fit perfectly with the ideas of President Eisenhower, the Dulles brothers and others who thought that covert operations was a very powerful tool in US foreign policy and it clearly served as a model or, you know, provided lessons for future operations, including the following year, in 1954, in Guatemala. At the time this coup seemed like a great success but let's look back at it from the perspective of history, from the perspective of today. The Shah ruled for 25 years, with increasing repression His repression produced the explosion of the late 1970's, what we call the Islamic revolution. That revolution brought to power a clerk of fanatically anti-American Mulls, who had spent the next quarter century, vigorously and sometimes very violently, trying to undermine western power all over the world. So from the perspective of history, this coup doesn't quite so successful at all. A lot of history came out of three weeks in Tehran, in the summer of 1953. These people remember this, even if it's not something that necessarily happened yesterday, you have to remember, Iran is a country with very long history. It is a culture that is very much dependent on people, understanding and knowing it's history. So something that happened 50 or 60 years ago, is not that very far back for a country who's history stretches 3000 years. What's interesting about 53, that is the episode, that is the time in which America in the Iranian mindsets, becomes a violator, becomes an aggressor. Prior to that, the view of Americans and the view of America amongst Iranian public, was an extremely positive one and well deserving so because America was correctly viewed as an anti colonial power, who opposed colonization, who itself had fought a war of independence against who, Great Britain. [music] You know we in the United States have short memories, people in the Middle East never forget and I think there is a political truth to that and the Iranian people I believe know all about it but the average American doesn't have the vaguest idea that we interfered with an elected government. What bothers me so much, is that the American people believe that we can do no harm, that we are willing to go to war, start a war to promote democracy with force, at the same time, sometimes when there's a leader in a country that's been elected even in recent years. elected leaders in the middle east, we don't like them, we don't support them. What CIA for many years has warned about blow back I know that when I brought that term up in the presidential debate, it wasn't my term and I referenced it to it haven't been established by the CIA, because they knew and understood this that they can come back on us, it was an unintended consequence We should know what went on in 1953, what happened with the coup there but I think that the goal of all individuals ot to be to know the truth The truth about our history and not to hide from us and when history is distorted, I think we just continue to make mistakes. So history is helpful if we're honest with ourselves. I think that's the most important thing for any country or any people, is to be honest with ourselves because when your own government does harm and you ignore it, or pretended it never existed or defend it for the wrong reasons, it's very detrimental. If the United States had not overthrown the Mosaddegh government it's at least conceivable that democracy would've continued to thrive and consolidate itself in Iran. We might have had a stable democracy in the heart of the Muslim middle east, all these 50 years. I can hardly wrap my mind around how different the middle east might look today, had that been the case. [music] The idea that it is necessary nefarious, it's always engaged in overthrowing governments, that's false. Asides from the birds. The government of Mosaddegh if you recall His was over thrown by the accident, the Shah. As far a I know, we don't engage in assassinations and kidnappings and things of that kind. As far as I know, we never have. I hope I have a reasonable moral standard. Well the Iranians were organizing themselves and really all they needed was support and to some extent professional guidance. It was my feeling then, that remains my feeling that the British understood the extent of paranoia in this country concerning communism this was the day of Joel McCarthy and the British consciously played on that fear in order to help persuade us, to involve ourselves in the coup. What we did from Washington, was to write some of the articles that would appear on the Persian press and these articles would appear thanks to the Dravidian’s who had contacts I believe with probably 4/5 of the Iranian press and they were designed to show most of that as a communist collaborator and as a fanatic, as a person who didn't understand that you could be both nationalistic and positive. These two agents saw the opportunity, and sent the people we had under our control, into the streets and acted as if they were today. They were provocateurs. We had more than just provocateurs we had a lot of shot troops who actually acted as if they were two dead people throwing rocks at mosques, at priests. That mob that came into north Tehran and was decisive in the overthrow was a mercenary mob, had no ideology and that mob was paid for by American dollars and the amount of money that was used it has to have been very large. The CIA prepared a report on how the coup had be carried out. It would serve as a guide for conducting coups in the future bu the report left out key details. But even if we saw the full report, there were certain things the author Donald Wilbert wouldn't have put in there because it wouldn't have been caution to put those in. Things such as the CIA working very closely with the Iranian Nazi party. That wouldn't have gone very well down in Washington. He also doesn't deal with actually questions of assassination which I suspect the MI6 and the CIA were involved. So that sort of sanitized out of the report. I think that in the 53 coup, the CIA was much more involved in the actual mechanics in of coup that in other places like Guatemala or Indonesia and places So there's much more very incriminating information and that's why the CIA has been very reluctant to release the stuff. Well I remember the start of the CIA from when I was in college it had just been recently started, 1947 after the war. The main purpose of course was so there would never be another pearl harbor When there were little snippets of information around and nobody to, these days we would say connect the dots. There was no one central place where all this information together and so Harry Truman was hell-bent and determined that would never happen again, there would be one central place which would be possessed of all the information available on a given country or situation. He was equally determined to have it one place where he could go and say look, Mr.Director I want to know what you and those two universities worth of specialists out there in the woods in Virginia. I want to know what you really think. I don't care what the State department is saying or the pentagon. The pentagon is telling me that the Russians are 10ft tall. I know they're not 10 ft tall. They may not be 5'9ft like you're saying, but I want to know what you think okay No, speak to me in truth. And man, it was clear that that's what Truman Intended What we got instead, was an apparatus that seemed revel in covert operations, Clandestine operations spend billions of tax payer dollars for those operations in total secrecy and expend blood and treasure in those operations, often times failing, in total secrecy. He wrote a not bad, I have a copy of it here. Not bad in the Washington Post December 22, 1963. As he watched these things happen you know, he watched Iran and he watched Guatemala and he saw governments toppled and he said hey man, hey time out That's not what I intended here. It says he simply does not recognize the entity that he helped create in 1947 in the CIA and clearly his angst is about the covert operations aspect of the CIA. and he sees it as a danger to the integrity and the health of our democratic republic. I have a copy of this, this thing. What he says is this, the title is Limit CIA Role To Intelligence Well ya, hello. That's what it's supposed to be all about right? Okay. Quote, I never thought that when I set up the CIA, it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations. Now there are some searching questions that need to be answered. I, therefore, would like to see the CIA restored to it's original assignment as the intelligence arm of the President, and that whatever else it can properly perform in that special field and that its operational duties be terminated or properly used elsewhere Well, you were right about a lot of things Harry. you're dead right about that. Truman ended his stinging rebuke of the CIA, by writing that "The agency is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it." Of course the Brits came over, as for our help, Allen Dulles and yes that would be great covert action authorized by the President and so they went in and they overthrew Mosaddegh, They threw him out okay, now that's where history begins, recent history for Iranians and Americans don't have any idea that there is this very legitimate grievance. and what came in? The Shah. What he did was bring in the most brutal secret police, bunch of torturers, second to none, even the German Gestapo. They were called Saks. With the help of American aid and training, Savak was created in 1957, it's name alone would come to strike fear in the hearts and minds of Iran’s citizens. Well the Savak becomes essentially the secret police for the Shah and their training and education and their mode to stop Iranians so forth are more or less given to them by the CIA person personnel who are, as far as I can tell, are also some military involved in this. The CIA and the military often work together, a very insidious relationship in my view. The 53 coup deprived the regime that ruled in Iran of legitimacy and the overwhelming majority of the people, even many of the people of were working for the regime. They previewed the regime as dependent on the United States, as fundamentally born of a sinful act. What Savak becomes for the Shah, is secret police do and many of these more autocratic societies, particularly when they're becoming more and more autocratic as the Shah was, is it takes care of all of it's oppositions, either arrest them and spirits them away to sites unknown, for purposes unknown, never to be contacted again, buries them in the desert, or whatever but it becomes the Shah's way of dealing with residence and dealing with it in a very draconian harsh way and of course this just breeds more and more discontent amongst the populous in Iran and makes him look more and more the tyrant rather than the beloved leader that he always wanted to be seen as. Under the Shah was unimaginable, that anybody would say anything critical within the political word, against anybody, absolutely not. So it was a combination of not that Savak was all pervasive or powerful but the physiological perimeter’s of the Savak and the political order had created a situation that we were all conscious and fearful of Savak. So the aura was created that the Savak is everywhere and it contributed to the terrorization and internalization of that terror in the society and the arch. and I made so many trips to Savak’s office answering questions and just, sometimes they take you in and you sit there for 5 hours and nobody comes out and there are a number of other people sitting in the room you're too fearful to say a word because you don't know who they are. So I did experience, it was the very beginning, it became far more viscous as time went on because it was the beginning of its formation when I was still in Iran. Several of our students you know, got refuge on the roofs the fifth floor, the sixth floor, they threw them away just threw them like garbage, down and many people got killed that way, many people had broken legs or arms. Being in the center of this torture chambers hearing all of these cries and screams coming everywhere. I mean, I couldn't sleep for a minute, yet 24 hours. because of this you are in solitary and this guy is screaming kill me! Don't do that, just kill me! I mean screams all over, you feel like you are there and they handcuffed me this way there was this hook and they could raise it so I could be kind of hanged from my hands and the pain [inaudible dialogue] and death would be, I mean just a relief. This is difficult for you to talk about it's a horrible experience. You don't have to if you don’t want to. I have a duty to say these things for American people to know what it was like under the Shah. The main reason that the Savak and the Shah was sent packing was because ever other family in Iran knew somebody or had one of the members of their family tortured That's what torture brings you okay. [music] After 25 years of increasingly despotic by the Shah millions of Iranians took to the streets in what would become known as The Islamic Revolution. The Shah fled the country in January of 1979. Later that year, Iranian students overran the US embassy in Tehran when the Shah was allowed to enter the United States. [crowd chanting] The man who called me was a man by the name of Frank Re dice who as on the desk that Sunday and he told me that a number of student demonstrators had broken into the US embassy and apparently had taken some American diplomats hostage and he wanted me to come in the state department I was then the senior diplomatic correspondent for ABC to do a piece on it for that evenings news and it was Sunday and I didn't want to come in and I told him I didn't think this thing would last more than an hour or two as I said like this things going to die. I mean it's not going to last. But regrettably every single day in Iran was a noninvasive day. Ultimately the hostages were held for 440 days. They appointed me as ambassador to the UN in order to facilitate this agreement. The group of us were throwing out names for this new program and Dick Wald said you know in racing, horse raising there is something called The Morning Line since this program is going at 11:30 at night why don’t we call it the Night Line. and I said that the dumbest I've ever heard I think that's a really stupid title for a program I left Tehran with the hope that I'm coming to the United States going to the security council doing everything we could to expedite the release of hostages. I met Jimmy Carter at the White house and he joked that the two people who had benefited most from the hostage take and were first the guy Ayatollah Khomeini and second, me. I didn't want to be the ambassador of a country that had taken hostages. I accepted the position in order to resolve the hostage crisis and when I came to realize that the hostage crisis is not going to be resolved there was absolutely no reason for me to stay there it would have been absurd because I thought the act was criminal and illegal and inhuman in every sense of the word. Certainly in the initial months of America Held Hostage I think the title was hysterical. Later turned out to be more accurate than it was at the outset. Nightlife and many other television programs and journalists, they were shocked. but the immorality and the illegality of the act which was understandable and yet after 25 years of supporting an illegitimate government, overthrowing democratic elected the prime minister in 1953 it was the responsibility of the press to gain an understanding of why it happened but at the same time "" The Nightlife and other television programs did not do that I forget whether we did that if we didn't it would have been a huge oversight, we should've. because that clearly was that was and is to this day you know I mean, 50 whatever it is 56 years later. That continues to be a very sole point with the Iranian people. When they had guests, or the newspapers interviewed various people in an article you could read a sentence or a phrase about the coup but the reader of the article is not going to end up thinking about the connection between what happened in 1953 and what happened in 1979. And if you show just a little of imagination and think how we would feel if some power greater than the United States had overthrown one of our presidents, had assisted one of our enemies in assaulting the homeland of the United States, had supported someone that we felt was a pretender to the White House, and giving him all kinds of weapons and overlooked human rights abusers that he and his secret police inflicted on the people of the United States I think we'd feel pretty upset about that and we would probably harbor that grudge a generation or five. The hostage crisis in one sense was a very simple thing I mean you had a group of students who wanted to demonstrate against the US who were unhappy with the way things were going. The role of the Shah was an important element in the evolution of the events in Tehran after the revolution. What was going to happen to him? should we anticipate that he would again be restored to the thrown? would we engage ourselves in the kind of coup we did in 1953 to restore him to the thrown? that was the concern among the part of the revolutionary elements in the city of Tehran at that time, in 1979. The Shah had been admitted back into the United States and this was considered to be the first step to returning him to the thrown that was not true but that's the way people remembering 1953 they thought this was the first step in bringing him back. to admit him into the United States in the context of the revolutionary afferment that was abroad in that country at that time, in 1979. There was something else so I said no, let's not admit him. Jimmy Carter was extremely reluctant to do this in fact he was the very last one of all of his advisers to finally agree to do this and in that final meeting that he had where he looked around the room and everybody in the room was telling him yes you you've got to let him in, he's dying, you can't reject his you can't tell him he can't have medical treatment and so forth and he looked around the room and I said well okay he said I hear what all of you are saying but he said I wonder what you're all going to say to me when they take our people hostage in Tehran. It was clear that this was a dangerous thing to do. He was admitted and we paid for it. [crowd chanting] The actions of Iran have shocked the civilized world for a government to applaud mob violence and terrorism for a government actually to support and in effect participate in the taking and holding of hostages is unprecedented in human history. They do about sit ins and they were going to come in, make their point they had done it once before, it had been done once before at the embassy in February and ended within 48 hours they very much had the same idea that this would be a short lived thing and they were as surprised as anybody else when Khomeini threw his support to the students they didn't come prepared to stay for 444 days and suddenly they found themselves not having a sit in, but running a prison. Lousy. Treatment during captivity was lousy. Not in the sense where they beat me everyday but it was in-violation of something very profound in the Iranian zone culture one of the leaders of the student militants who were then holding the three of us in solitary confinement each of us in separate cells. He came in to see me one day, in my cell and I proceeded, I took the opportunity to say look why are you doing this? It is totally contrary to all Iranian traditions of freedom human rights treating us this way physically abused as hostages it is totally absolutely wrong why are you doing this? He responded by saying you have nothing to complain about your country took my country hostage in 1953 totally and abrogated the opportunities that we had then we're a free participatory democracy. I was reminded of 1984 particularly if you remember the incident in there of the two minutes hate that everyday at Winston Smiths ministry they would all stop work and they would get together and they would have two minutes of hate and they would scream, shout slogans and scream and yell and get all excited and then they would have hate week that seemed very much the situation we were in I couldn't identify today, where it was or is but it was a prison, a dark cold prison where my colleagues had been held in and out of prisons during those months and I could do nothing to help them, that was my hurt that was my mental hurt if you will. but beyond what happened to me personally the event still resonates, it resonates in this country it resonates around the world and for better or worse and mostly for worse it shapes the way people look at Iran The student captures also controlled all of the library of the embassy compound and so we all got access to books, eventually not the books you wanted one of my colleagues is much quoted as having said first book they gave me was a god damn geometry book I never liked geometry but I read everything in that book. You ignore history and you ignore Iranians view of history and you ignore the history of the United States and Iran at your peril. to give you the simplest example in October of 1979, when the White House decided to admit the Shah to the country it said alright we will do this but we will tell the Iranians that we're doing this only for humanitarian reasons because the Shah is sick and so he's coming to the United States only for medical treatment and there is no political agenda. Well, that may have been true but given the history of US Iranian relations I doubt that any Iranian over the age of 3 would have believed such an explanation and perhaps that was why the events of 1953 and the Americans coming eventually siding with the British working to overthrow Dr.Mosaddegh's nationalist government came as such a profound shock I mean had it been the British they probably would've been expected, had it been the Russians would've been expected but from someone who you thought was your friend it was seen as a very deep betrayal Freedom as one comes to appreciate, eventually and certainly as a hostage in solitary confinement is a beautiful thing. They were 20 years old at the time we were all 20 years old at the time. when we're at that age you're emotional you don't think through what you do. I don't blame them so much for what they did I blame those who rode the wave who did not take up their responsibilities. I understood their zeal you have to understand that even though you think they are wrong you give them credit for being zealous and they sure as hell were determined to hold as long as they could I have no particular malice towards each and every one of them except my hope my them, my I wish for them is they never get a visa to come to my country. I can get emotional in that subject. You make gestures, you lower the tone of the rhetoric, you stop the sermonizing you put your preconceptions aside I have said since the day I left since the moment I entered the Algerian aircraft to return me to freedom I said it to the principle hostage taker at the top of the ramp I look forward to the day your when your country and mine can again have a normal diplomatic relationship I have advocated that ever since, I have preached the need to talk. We should be talking. Now, will that bring an immediate change? will that bring immediate positive results? probably not, suspicions still run deep you don't overcome 30 years of hostility with one speech or one gesture but you keep at it. [music] Khatami made a speech in January of 88' in which he basically went as far as any Iranian leader is ever likely to go and saying that clearly we would never do that again and those were different times and so forth he can't come out and say oh we were completely wrong, he can't say that I mean Khomeini was behind it, he supported it all the way and he's the father of their country it's like saying George Washington made a foolish mistake you don't just say things like that. The problem with US Iran relations is not so much foreign policy it's domestic policy. In the United States, Iran is a dirty word and has been since the time of the hostage crisis it's very hard to get politicians to say anything constructive about Iran and our relations with Iran it's easier to dismiss them, to criticize them or to suggest harder sanctions on them or punishment In Iran it's the same thing. The revolution was as much an anti-American revolution as it was an anti-Shah revolution we're going to have to give up something but Iran is going to have to give up something and that's what negotiations are all about. [music] In January of 2002, George Bush gave his second state of the union address he singled out Iran for special attention and thereby damaged chances for a better relationship Here we've got after all an administration that finds in Afghanistan in 2000 late 2001, 2002 that the Iranians are very cooperative that the Iranians are helping you that the Iranians are helping you with everything from rounding up the Taliban, finding Al-Qaeda who might have flown into Iran working for The Bonn conference, in stalling Karzai that they are helping you as much as anybody else in the region and you pay them back by giving a state of union address which calls them a member of the access of evil which is imponderable to them they don't even know what that means but they know it's bad Iran aggressively prosue these weapons and exports terror states like these and their terrorist allies constitute and access of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world and so their payback for having cooperated in Afganistan is to be called a member of the access of evil imagine their befuddlement and imagine their anger I'm Iranian and that's funny cause people I tell them my American friends, I go ya I'm Iranian they go oh so you're Arab and I'm like no we're actually different we're not Arab but I mean you know we're similar you know we're all getting shot at, you know that's one thing but you Iranians are actually ethnically, we're actually Arian we're white, we're white, so stop shooting you know a lot of the times I would get in an argument with people around the time of the Iraq war, cause I was against the war and a lot of the times people would say we got to do this got to do that and I'd always say do you know the history let's go back a little bit and see how we got here in the first place and I would always bring the 53 coup into the argument The Iranians don't even say their Iranian Iranians say they're Persian. In Iran we say we are Persian you know it sounds nicer and friendlier we even smile, when we say we're Persian we smile "I am Persian!" "I am Persian!" "I am not dangerous, I am Persian!" "I am Persian like the cat" "I am the cat!" "I am Persian like the rug, hello rug colorful, hand woven." I have a friend who's conservative and we have these debates and I go go back and look that Iran had a democracy and that US with England, they came in overthrew that democracy to implement a monarchy for the oil. So you know you got to have a historical perspective before before you get into these debates. People think that just because I'm from the Middle East I'm an expert on the Middle East So like I got a friend, every time the gas prices go up he'll always ask my opinion about it he'll always corner me, "hey Mass, hey Mass in your opinion what's going on with this gas thing what's going to happen, what's going on 50 words or less, breakdown would you you're my middle eastern friend." like dude I don't work at Opek, I don't know I pay the same price as you you know, like I don't have a discount pump at the gas station I don't want in like "Hassan Hussein discount pump, okay my friend." [laughter and applause] Fuck America [laughter] I joke about that, I said you know it was funny cause the hijackers were Saudis and Egyptians and somehow Iran ended up in the access of evil I remember watching that and he was like there's an access of evil, I was like yes there is and he goes it's North Korea, I'm like ya he goes it's Iraq, I go right on he goes it's Iran, I'm like what the hell, what do we do you know okay we might have a nuclear program but we're not admitting to it, maybe we have a nuclear program maybe we don't, define nuclear. I think that goes back to that whole cause Iran also calls America the great Satan It's kind of like five year old’s on a playground just name calling. So it was unfortunate, it's undiplomatic let's put it that way. [music] The Bush administration came into office thinking there was a quick and easy solution to the proliferation problem fortunately there is now a wide spread at least expert consensus that this strategy of forced regime change didn't work, that the solution is to leave the regime change up to the people of the country themselves the only ones who can really change the regime and to seek other combinations of pressures and incentives to convince those countries, convince those people to abandon nuclear programs. The Iranian program is a threat in many ways, but the answer isn't to force the regime to give up the program no country has ever been forced to give up a nuclear program but lots of countries have be convinced to do so. The NIE also correctly understood that the drivers behind Iran’s program were not some crazy idea of a global genocide or annihilation of Israel they were the same motives that have motivated most countries who have pursued nuclear weapons, a desire for security to protect them from attack a desire for enhanced prestige. Think India getting the bomb, there is no real military option here history is very clear on this score, an attack on a country causes the people of that country to rally around the leadership, not flee from it it often will lead to an acceleration of military programs containment works, deterrence is alive and well the worst case, scenario is not good but it's a lot better than starting a nuclear war in the neighborhood. No US President has ever spoken that way to the Muslim people and when he referenced the 1953 coup against the democratic leadership of Iran, he was doing so not as an apology but just stating a truth everybody knows what the US has done in that region and when he coupled that with an explicit reference to colonialism, for many Muslims this was unbelievable that you heard a western leader acknowledging this just as a fact that we have to deal with and then let's move on, let's have a new relationship new structures, based on our needs now, fully aware of the sins and omissions hat both sides have committed in the years passed. Iran's a country, it's a very youthful country vast majority of the country are less than 30 years old born after the revolution actually and very well educated, it's a majority Shia country over 90% Shia but it's also pretty ethnically diverse and there are lots of minorities, there's Arabs there's Kurd, there's Turks, there's Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sunnis as well as Shia so it's pretty ethnically diverse, at the same time it is overwhelmingly Shia. Ya every Iranian you can talk about in the 1953 CIA backed coup against the democratically elected government of Prime minister Mosaddegh and the reason every Iranian knows knows that history is cause they're taught it every school kid knows about it, the same way we know that George Washington fought the British, the same we way know who Benjamin Franklin was and Iranians will know that there was a democratically elected government that was overthrown by the CIA. President Khatami expressed regret rather than an apology or feeling shameful about it, certainly not proud of it I don't think hardly anybody is proud of it including the students who took over the embassy Out beyond the ideas of wrongdoing and right-doing there's a field, I'll meet you there and the reason I put that in the introduction was because I think it speaks very well to the idea of why I wrote the book in the first place, which is complete misunderstanding between Iran and the United States and it's accusations fly back and forth, you did this, you did this you are doing this, you are doing that you're wrong here, you're right here I'm right here, you're wrong there none of that ever gets us anywhere, that's all rhetoric and it's always accusations, like a fight any fight and we’re in this conflict but there's place where you go, go beyond those accusations beyond those fights, beyond those issues that we have between us, there's a place where we could meet and discuss things. On June 12th 2009 Iranians went to the polls in large numbers. when the Presidential election appeared stolen, they took to the streets in protests, situations seem to harpen back to what happened to Iran’s nascent democracy of the 1950's. [music] The protests have subsided but it's obvious that peoples sense of anger and injustice hasn't subsided and millions of people which represented diverse swathe of Iranian society, not only in Tehran but throughout the Country are risking their lives, almost on a daily basis for greater political voice, for more economic opportunities for more social freedoms and I think Iranians have really inspired people throughout the world. Mousavi has earned a tremendous respect from people for not backing down to the hardliners, for continuing the fight and in a way the relationship between Mousavi and the crowd is somewhat symbiotic in the sense that I think that the crowds are inspired by Mousavi unwillingness to back down and Mousavi is frankly is odd I think by the courage of the crowd and that allows him the political capital to remain defiant. What's interesting about Mousavi is that he is not an opposition candidate who has actually been an opponent of the regime, he's someone with impeccable revolutionary credentials, he was prime minister for 8 years, he was someone who was close to the father of the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini and he's not for a wholesale revolution, what he's saying is that the revolution, the ideals of the 1979 revolution have veered off onto a dangerous path and we need to take it back onto the [Persian word] as they say in Persian, 'the right path'. In the last 1970's, the iconic images which emerged from the revolution were bearded, middle aged, traditional men. The iconic images from this movement have been young, educated, modern female like Neda Agha-Soltan who was killed and women's role in these protests I think have been quite frankly awesome. women have continued to go to the streets despite the regimes indiscriminate use of words I think any change which takes place in Iran will and will have played an incredibly important role in bringing about that change and it's remarkable that days and weeks and months and I'm sure years after Neda’s death, people from around the world are never going to forget that image and are never going to forget her tremendous bravery and are never going to forget the conditions under which she died. Right now theres an incredible whirlwind of emotions that Iranians are feeling there's tremendous hope and tremendous fear all at the same time. there is this hope that finally after 30 years there is light at the end of the tunnel there's hope for a more modern, progressive, tolerant Iran. You have a unique situation in the sense that, right now about two thirds of Iranians are under 33 so they don’t remember the 1979 revolution they have no inherent enmity towards the United States they have no inherent loyalty towards the Islamic republic. 2009 is a much different world than 1979 1979, there wasn't internet, there wasn't satellite television, people couldn’t see what was taking place beyond their borders this has been a movement which has transcended age, it's transcended gender, it's transcended geographic location, it's transcended religiosity, it's transcended socioeconomic class and again when millions of people have taken to the streets despite the risk of wars despite the risks to the security you can only imagine that there's millions of people who feel solidarity with them at home. So we should not underestimate the magnitude of this moment. The problems are not that intractable we have huge common interest here and we have resolved problems much greater than this. In my life, I've seen miracles happen I've seen Germany unite, the Soviet Union collapse, the war in Vietnam now embraces American tourism. I've seen Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland who swore never, never, never, and denounced each other as terrorists, shake hands and form a united government. I've seen a man walk out of a prison cell that held him for 28 years to become the majority leader of South Africa. Don't tell me that miracles can't happen don't tell me that any of these challenges are too big or too intractable that we have to use military force to resolve them I think that the US and Iran are destined to become partners once again. We have the power to make the world we seek but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning keeping in mind what has been written the Holy Qur’an tells us Oh man kind, we have created you male and a female and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you make know one another The Talmud tells us: "The whole of the Tūrān is for the purpose of promoting peace." The Holy Bible tells us: "Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of God." [applause] The people of the world can live together in peace we know that is Gods vision now that must be our work here on earth. Thank you and may Gods peace be upon you.
