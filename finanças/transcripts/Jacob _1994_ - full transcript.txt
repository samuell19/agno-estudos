[wind whistling] [camel grunts] [camels grunting] [yells] (man) I can't see! (Isaac) Esau! Behind you. [tent flapping] (Esau) Not that loose. (Esau) let it bend with the wind, not break. [sheep bleating] [sheep continue bleating] Is Abraham safe? Yes. His tent is out of the wind. You go on ahead. I'll make sure the wells are capped. We don't want them full of sand by morning. [shepherd chattering] [sheep bleating] Oh, help me! Help me! [camel grunting] (man) Just leave him! Just leave him! [rain pattering] (Rebekah) That took long enough. Where are the boys? One fights the storm to save the wells. The other is with his grandfather. Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who brings forth the bread from the earth. Amen. [sheep bleating] Ah, Esau always stalks the finest in the herd. He never takes the easy kill. The people of Abraham need more than a strong arm in their leader. I know I'm from a different tribe-- Now don't start, woman. [rain pattering] Esau is the firstborn. (Rebekah) Jacob came second, But he was clutching his brother's heel. He tried to get out first. But it was Esau the hunter who was first. And then Jacob. One, a man of action... And the other, a man who cares about the tribe. (Isaac) Now, that is enough. I think Abraham hears god's voice whenever the wind blows. God speaks to all of us. Yes, but we don't all hear him. Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe Who brings forth the bread from the earth. Amen. Do you hear him? (Jacob) Hear god's voice? Me? I often feel there's someone watching. Do you know what I mean? I do. I feel it all the time. But it always turns out to be a Canaanite woman, following me like a lovesick cow. [Esau and Isaac laugh] And you encourage them. You'll end up with a Canaanite wife. I could do worse. Pickings are slim in our camp. [sheep bleating] [grunts] Here. Let's find some shade. (Jacob) You go on. Jacob, my son is dying. My firstborn. [sobs] [wheezes] [mumbles] Be strong, Elon. The God of Abraham watches over you. [bird twittering] [bird screeching] God of Abraham, protect and keep this, your servant. Mmm, smells delicious. That's quite a prize I stalked him half the day. ...Even for a hunter like you. There's only one greater pleasure, believe me. [laughs] You should come with me to the Canaanite women. That's a thrill even you could enjoy. Perhaps I already have. You might enjoy it more if your head was clear And you knew who you were lying with. You talk like an old woman stirring her porridge. Well, porridge has its uses. (Esau) I'm hungry. Give me some. No. It's for Gaham's boy. He's sick. Damn you! I brought home enough meat for the entire tribe. Don't I deserve a little porridge? I tell you, it's for Gaham's boy. There's enough for both of us. Then wait. Don't just think of yourself. [lamb bleating] You think I'm stupid, don't you? No, but you're very uncaring. You're the firstborn. Firstborn be damned. What does that mean? Just a bit bigger share of what father leaves us. If your inheritance means so little to you, And your hunger is so desperate, give it to me. And in return, you can take all the porridge you want. Done. No, it's not that easy. Swear it. Swear by the God of Abraham. That in return for the porridge, I give up my inheritance. The inheritance of the firstborn to you, my brother Jacob. [pot thudding] Did you pair as many animals as you'd hoped? Yes, mother. By spring, we'll be overrun with lambs. We've never had a better man tending the flocks. Not difficult to persuade animals to couple, mother. Nor some men. (Jacob) I won't speak against Esau. He married outside our tribe. And now he's building a stone house, like the Canaanites. How's father? His eyesight is worse. (Rebekah) And I know he's in pain. [camel grunting] Esau? No, father. It's Jacob. Ah. Do you think Esau is too busy? For you, father? Never. I'll fetch him. Esau! Father wants to see you. [women giggling] Well, what do you think? You should build one for yourself. A stone house? No, Esau. I'm not a Canaanite. [laughs] (Isaac) Hairy, just like the animals that fear your bow. [Isaac panting] I'm an old man, Esau, And the hour of my death is near. No, father. No, listen. Listen to me. Take your bow, Find some game, the finest in the herd, (Isaac) prepare it, and then bring it to me. (Isaac) When I've eaten my fill, then, Then, I'll give you my paternal blessing. (Esau) No, father. It is time. Don't argue. Do as I say. Or I'll be gone And you'll no longer have the chance. Quickly! Get Jacob. Tell him to come here at once. God intended you to continue Abraham's line, Not Esau. Really? He told you so, did he? When I was with child, I was in great pain. I sought the counsel of God. "2 nations are within your womb," I was told. "2 manner of men shall be delivered to you. "the one is stronger than the other And the elder shall serve the younger." You are the one who pleases god. You must understand that. No. I can't do that to Esau. I've already taken his inheritance as firstborn. That's enough. Really? You feel no call? You never sense a presence at your shoulder? Fetch me 2 young goats. I'll prepare a meal for your father. You can take it to him. He's nearly blind. He'll bless you. No. Don't you want the elder son's blessing? Don't you want to carry on the line begun by Abraham? Not by deception. All that counts is that you do it. Esau will turn us into Canaanites. Do as I say. This is God's will. (Jacob) mother, can any good come from this? (Rebekah) This must be God's wish, Or he would've made you the hunter And Esau the one who cares. [groaning] It won't work. He'll feel my arms and know it's not Esau. Quiet. It will work. Father. I'm here. Is it Jacob or Esau? Your firstborn. And I've done as you wished. I've brought you the food. Come closer. Closer, my son, so that I may touch you. Take the food that I prepared for you And then you can give me your blessing. (Isaac) The arm is the arm of Esau, But the voice is the voice of Jacob. Are you truly my son Esau? Yes, I am your son. Come near, my son, and kiss me. Yes, you are truly Esau. (Isaac) God give you the dew of heaven, The riches of the earth, Grain, and new wine in plenty. May people serve you and nations bow down to you. May you be lord over your brothers And may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, And a blessing on those who bless you. [sighs] Who's that? It's me. Esau. Come, sit up and eat. Then you can give me your blessing. Why are you feeding me again? I've blessed you already. Who was it who brought food to me? Jacob. Damn him! [pot shatters] First, he takes my birthright. Now he steals my blessing. Esau, my son, what have I done? Have you no blessing left for me? I've given him everything. I've made him your master. But you must bless me instead. But I blessed him. And he must remain blessed. God saw me bless Jacob. He allowed it to happen. I--I cannot change that. Then bless me, too. Bless me, too. [sobbing] You shall enjoy the riches of the earth And the dew of heaven. But you will live by the sword. You've deceived me once too often. I'll have your heart before sunrise. You care nothing for us. Nothing for who we are! (Jacob) I deserve the blessing of the firstborn! [grunting] (Rebekah) Jacob! Stop! Stop it! (Rebekah) Esau! Would you curse your father's last days by murdering your brother? [grunts] (Esau) I give you warning. Our father's days are numbered. And once he's been properly mourned, I'll kill you, brother, and never shed a tear. You die the day after he does. You must leave here, Jacob. You must move on. I'm not afraid of Esau! Do as I say, or he will kill you. Then they will kill him! I don't want to lose 2 sons in one day. (Rebekah) Your father wants you. Hurry. Do as he tells you! He wants to send me away. Is that why he blessed me? (Isaac) It is time you were married, Jacob, But not to a Canaanite woman. You must go to Padanaram and find a wife there. One of the daughters of Laban, Your mother's brother. Now, Jacob, May God bless you. May he make you fruitful and increase your descendants until they become a community of nations. (Isaac) May he bestow on you and your offspring The blessing given to Abraham So that you can possess the land where you are now living, The land God gave to Abraham. [sheep bleating] A special gift for your bride. [sniffs] (man) He's taking a rich dowry. Are you just going to let him go? These are my father's last days. (Esau) I can't harm Jacob. What hurts you hurts me. You're my brother-in-law. I cannot have his death on my head. Of course not. [wind whistling] [bird calls] [camel grunting] [hooves clomping] [bird screeching] Esau. [camel grunts] [camel grunting] [continues grunting] [camel snorting] [donkey braying] [continues braying] [donkey screeches] [camel grunting] [bird caws] (voice) I am the Lord, The God of Abraham and your father, Isaac. I will give this land to you and your descendants. They will be as countless as the specks of dust on the ground. And you will spread far and wide To west and east, to north and south. All the families of the earth will long to be blessed as you and your descendants are blessed. I shall be with you to protect you wherever you go and I shall bring you back to this land. I shall not leave you until I have done what I promised you. [crickets chirping] [bird calls] [bird screeching] If God will be with me, and if He will protect me on my journey, and if I return safely to my father's house, Then the Lord shall be my God. and of everything He gives me, I will set aside a tenth part for Him. What happens even if I get there? I have no dowry now! No means to get a wife! Tell me! [grunting] Yes. Yes, I will go on. I've placed my faith in Him Who showed me the gateway to heaven. [bird cawing] [sheep bleating] (Jacob) My friends! My friends! (Jacob) Where are you from? We're from Haran. (Jacob) Oh. [grunts] Then I'm here. [pants] God has delivered me. [sheep bleating] Do you know, do you know Laban, son of Nahor? Anyone who doesn't is from a long way off. [sheep continue bleating] Can you take me to him? (man) She can take you to him. She's his wife? (man) She's his daughter. He's looking for your father. I will take you to him Once we have watered the flocks. [sheep bleating] [Jacob grunts] [grunting] [water sloshing] You are generous with your strength. [lamb bleats] Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm Jacob. (Jacob) Son of Rebekah, your father's sister! [bird twittering] [all chattering] [camel grunting] [all continue chattering] (man) Laban! [women giggling] (man) Laban! Laban! Laban! [sheep bleating] Laban, I must see you now. Why do fortune tellers get in such a state? They are supposed to know what is going to happen, aren't they? [men laugh] When I cast the stones this morning, there was a new message: A presence will soon be among us, a presence that will make us all rich. [laughs] Starting with you, I suppose Since you'll want payment for this prediction. [men laugh] No, Laban, I swear. [sheep bleating] Swear it on oath before my household gods. I do. I do so swear. A great presence is near to us. (Rachel) Father! A man at the well. Jacob. [pants] A--a man who--who calls himself Son of Rebekah, your sister. Really? Then bring him here, Rachel. There may be something to this, after all. Great wealth from the son of nomads? (Jacob) Uncle. I am Jacob, son of Isaac and Rebekah, [panting] Your sister. [groans] Great wealth, did you say? I'd have another look at your stones, soothsayer. It's true. I swore it on your gods, Laban. Sit down, nephew. Join us in our humble meal. [claps] So, I gather you were attacked by thieves. Yes, uncle. They prey on the caravan routes. Oh, yes, yes. We live in lawless times. [mumbles] Did they take a great deal? A bride's ransom. (Laban) Ah. You must stay with us until you get your strength back. Then I shall want to hear more. We all will. (Laban) This is Morash, my eldest son. [Laban chuckles] At least they didn't rob you of your appetite, huh? [men laugh] (Laban) Have the flocks been counted, Be'or? (Laban) Ah, this is my second son. (Be'or) Not yet, father. Ah, we need more eyes in the fields. Well, perhaps my nephew can help. I would be honored, uncle. Good. Leah will be your guide (Laban) show you our home, our village, and our fields. (Laban) she's my eldest daughter. I would be grateful for her help. [sheep bleating] [sheep grunts] [all giggling] [sheep bleating] [lamb bleating] (Soothsayer) It's Jacob's doing. (Laban) Whatever he touches flourishes. How do we know it's him? (Soothsayer) It's his doing. (Soothsayer) And his god, to whom he prays nightly. Tell me, which one? My prayers must be as good as his. It's not a god known to us. (Laban) We must keep Jacob here. (Morash) He has his eye on Rachel. (Be'or) And she's noticed him. Rachel. Where did you come from? I had to bring the midday meals. Leah's not well. You work too hard. Oh, this was just an accident. You push yourself. Why would a god that makes everything you touch succeed Want you to struggle? To make me worthy. Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who brings forth the bread from the earth. Amen. But one day... What? ...He'll reward me. How? With your love. If he truly cares for me. [sheep bleating] I hope my brothers never hear you speak like that. They won't. Not until the time is right. It will never be time until Leah is married. I can wait. Don't be afraid. If we were seen, we'd be stoned. Don't run away, Rachel. Please. You know I won't. I can't. But we must be careful. [panting] [clicking tongue] You hear that? Yes. It's a sign between the 2 of us That one of us wants to speak with the other. If it is returned, it means no one is about. [clicking tongue] Now is not a good time. [clicking tongue] Morash knows I'm bringing the midday meals. [clicking tongue] Jacob, [crickets chirping] It's not right That you should work for nothing. Yeah. Tell me what wages you want. I don't expect wages, uncle. Then what made you come here? Rebekah, your sister and my mother wanted me to take one of your daughters to be my wife. (Laban) Ah. [snapping fingers] Why should I give up something so precious to a man who has nothing? I know I come empty-handed, but I'm a good worker. Take me as a laborer. I'll give you 5 years for Rachel. It would be a great break with tradition to see Rachel married before Leah. I'm blood of your blood. This isn't a marriage outside of the family. Yeah, that's true. And you know I'm a good worker, which means a good provider. Everything you touch flourishes. Then let me work for you. For 5 years. 10. 7. So be it. Stay here and work for me. I promise you'll never regret this day. Why don't you tell Rachel yourself? [chuckling] But perhaps she knows already. [laughing] You're cheating Leah. Oh, 7 years is a long time. We'll worry about it later. [sighing] I'm sorry for Leah. But what pains her gives me great joy. And me? Each morning, I've been frightened you'd say it was time to leave. I will leave, first thing in the morning 7 years from today. But I'll never leave without you. [sighs] [men chattering] (Soothsayer) Whatever Jacob touches flourishes. [dog barking] The rain comes on time. The grass grows like weeds. It's Jacob's god. (Soothsayer) If Jacob leaves, His god, who is so strong and bountiful, will leave with him. There is a way. (Laban) This is not a man who can be forced. It needs cleverness. He must think he stays by his own choice. [knocking at door] [snoring] (Jacob) Laban! [knocking continues] [Laban grunting] (Jacob) Laban! [knocking continues] Jacob. I've served my time. [titters] I've come for Rachel. You're--you're very prompt. You'll keep your word? Oh, o-o-of course I will. Of course. Oh. Ah, we must make plans for the wedding. Should we invite anyone from your family? Your--your brother, perhaps? No. I'll see him soon enough when I take my bride back. Back to my own country. Oh. All in good time. First, come in. We must prepare the wedding feast. [laughing] I wish I were dead. I wish father were dead, and those ugly gods he worships. At least Jacob's god stands for honor and decency. Then why is he letting all this happen? Why is he deserting Jacob now? What's meant for Jacob is meant for me and for you. It will end as it should. I have faith in that. [rooster crowing] [music playing] [people laughing] [people chattering] Sit, sit. Come, come. [water sloshing] [music playing] [music stops] Where's Leah? Um, she is in her room. She's terribly upset. It's understandable, huh? The bride awaits her master. But the room is dark. A tradition to honor modesty. The bed chamber must be unlit on the wedding night. [door closing] Rachel? [clicking tongue] [clicking tongue] [clicking tongue] [birds chirping] [cow mooing] [rooster crowing] [sheep bleating] You? You? All night long, I called you Rachel. And you answered me. How did you know the signs? Rachel had no choice, Jacob. What else could she do? One word from you would've stopped it all! Have you never wanted something so badly That you would deceive even the people you love to get it? God. My God. Will my debt never be paid? Will I never atone? [sighs] Where's Laban? [door opening] Laban! (Laban) No, no, no! Don't do anything! (Jacob) You deceived me! Give me a reason not to kill you! I can explain! Help me! Help me! Would your god want my blood on your hands? [grunting] [gasping] Out, out. Everybody out. Out. [pants] (Jacob) Give me a reason not to kill you! (Laban) I can explain! Help me! Stop him! [groaning] [panting] I've not deceived you. Rachel is yours. You shall have Rachel. I swear it. And you ignored the pain you'd cause and settled on deception! No, no, no. Well, not exactly. We all have to deceive a little. Leah is now yours. And once this week of celebration is over, I shall give you Rachel as a bride as well. I only wanted one wife, you fool! But 2 wives speak well of a man. 2 dowries. They show the world how rich he is. What dowries? You've kept me penniless for 7 years! That's not a problem. You live here with my daughters and work another 7 years for your second bride, Rachel. Huh? You get the goods in advance, so to speak. It seems hard, But it is the only way the gods have left you. [titters] There is no other way. Please don't hate me. I don't hate you. [sheep bleating] [sighs] [panting] [groans] [Leah screams] (woman) Fetch blankets! [Leah screams] (woman) Almost here. You'll soon be blessed with a fine son. Now, push again! [screaming] Here it comes! Where are the blankets? [baby crying] We shall call you Judah, which means "praise." And that is what we must offer god: Praise for his bounty. 4 sons, my husband. Do you love me now? Knife. I win. Oh, what's going on? You're never happier, Jacob, Than when your wife gives you another son. Leah is a gentle woman. It would be wrong to punish her for what your father did. You're also my wife. The children are a gift from god, A blessing for all of us. I want to be like her, Jacob. Please give me children or I shall die of pain. I'm not God. Children aren't mine to give. But you were chosen by him. Why does he prefer Leah? Tell me what to do. What can I do? Lie with my slave girl. Please lie with her, so she can give birth on my knees. Then I will have a child of my own. Please do this for me, Jacob. Bilhah. [dog barking] It's exactly as I predicted. While Jacob remains here his god enriches us all. (Laban) I hope we will all remember who kept Jacob here. How could we forget, father? But his second 7 years are nearly up. How are we going to keep him? He has no reason to leave now. He has 7 sons by Leah, 2 from the slave girl, Bilhah, Another by Leah's slave girl, Zilpah. And for good measure, Leah has given him a daughter, Dinah. Oh, you've come early to please an old man. God has blessed me, father. What are you talking about? Father, I am with child. (Jacob) Rachel's blessing is a sure sign. When our child is born, we will take our leave. Of course, I can't stop you going. But you will be a sorry sight when you get there. If you get there at all. [Laban sighing] You came empty-handed, So you must leave empty-handed. I think you will find it difficult To keep your enormous brood without water or food On such a long journey. You want to keep me here a prisoner? No, no, no, no. You've earned dowries for my daughters. I'm honor-bound to pay you. Name your price. No. I don't want your silver, I don't want your gold. But... I want a share in your flocks. I deserve that. Go through your entire stock. Remove all of your black lambs And all of your speckled goats. They will be my wages. But all my sheep are white, and all my goats are black. You'll have nothing. I'll have all I need. I'm guided by the hand that showed me the gateway to heaven. Then tell me the story again. Please. (Jacob) I told Laban that I would go through his flocks and pick out every black lamb and every speckled goat. They would be my wages. But Laban and his sons cheated and removed all the speckled goats and all the rams that were black. Then the angel of God appeared to me in a dream. So, I took fresh rods of poplar and plane trees and peeled off strips of bark, exposing the white of the rods. I put the peeled rods in the water troughs, and fixed some of them upright so that they were facing the she-goats that were on heat when they came to drink. Take the poles out when the weaker animals come to drink. We want to breed from the strongest. (Jacob) They mated in front of the rods, and gave birth to young that were striped and spotted and speckled. And now you see why I put my trust in the Lord. [lamb bleating] It's sorcery. It's robbery. And when Rachel has the child... [grunting] (Jacob) And the ewes gave birth to black sheep. [sheep bleating] [inaudible] So our wealth has increased. Your son. Joseph. We shall call you Joseph. That means "the one who will add to our people." Joseph. [laughs] Joseph. Thank you. Last night, the Lord appeared to me again. It will soon be time to leave. (Jacob) I must do as God tells me, But I cannot force you to leave your father. I think we should all do what God tells you. Father sold us for profit. He got his price. We are worthless to him now. Then we must wait our chance. You must shear your sheep and move your flocks to the winter grazing. It's time! No. I do as God tells me. Oh, you and your god. Your flocks will perish in the winter snow. The animals will die. Then you'll be praying to my god. Do as you please. We move our flocks and return in 6 days. [camels grunting] We leave in 3 days, when he's farthest from home. We must be careful. None of his servants must know our plan. [rooster crowing] [bleating] We must move faster. Gilead is still a good 5 days away. Will Esau be there to meet us? Once he knows we're near, I think he'll certainly be there to meet us. What's the matter? He's my brother. Just as Joseph is yours. There should never be bad blood in a family. But I don't think your grandfather, Laban would agree. Fools! Why didn't you send someone after me? We did, master, but you were back before he found you. Let's go after him, father. Let's kill him, and let's take back the flocks. No. But the flocks are ours. Jacob stole them by sorcery! Oh, you won't defeat Jacob by force! We need guidance. [gasps] I'll follow him even to his father's tent and I'll kill him there. He's no more than a day's ride ahead. We pitch camp here for the night. (Jacob) Tomorrow, we'll be in my brother's land. I'll ride on ahead and set the trail for the morning. (Jacob) I'm almost home. Almost home. It is you, God of my fathers, Who wins the victories for your servant Jacob. It's not the sword that saved me, But your guidance and love. (God) Listen carefully, Laban. Do not lay your hand on the man I have blessed. Do Jacob no harm. You have delivered me from my adversaries. You have thrown my enemies into confusion. [bird cawing] Simeon. Simeon. It's Laban. He's here! Hey! [whimpering] [all cheering] You see? It's easy. All you need-- (man) Esau! Esau, your brother. My brother. He's less than 2 days ride away. Is he alone? There must be nearly 100 people with him. Get the men. I want them armed. We leave now! What are you waiting for? You'll do nothing unless I tell you. Jacob. Jacob, my son. What have you done? We could have talked it over, huh? You're a very clever man, Laban. But talking to you leads to years of servitude. But why, Jacob, did you steal my gods? How can I ignore such an insult? Your gods? (Jacob) I didn't steal your gods. How can you deceive me? I will never do such a thing. Search my camp. Whoever stole your gods shall die. This I swear by everything I hold dear. Why have you got Joseph? Rachel's sick. Oh. Forgive me for not getting up, father. I am as women are once a month. My dear, Forgive me. (Jacob) Have you found anything? No. Then let us go. They are my daughters, my children, my livestock. Everything you see is mine! But I cannot go back with you! I must go on until I reach the land promised to me by Abraham and Isaac. I worked all those years only to make myself worthy of it. Then this is where our paths separate. I swear I shall not pass this way again before God. Nor shall I cross beyond this point. If you ill-treat my daughters, or betray them with other women, The God of Abraham must be your judge. (Jacob) We must offer a sacrifice, Seal our pact. [knife slashing] [goat bleats] [camel grunting] He's straight ahead of us. Come on. (Esau) We'll take him tomorrow. We pitch camp here. But the sun's still high. We should go on. We're now in the land of Esau. We go no further till he and I have settled our differences. I want you to prepare an offering of gifts. Select the finest of our lambs and goats, the best of our ewes and she-goats, our very best broadcloth, and prepare a caravan. Tzurim. I want you to drive it west to Seir. Find my brother. Present him with my gifts. (Jacob) Tell him where I've been all these years. Tell him that he is my king and that what you bring shows my respect and obedience. How long do we stay here? Until the gifts are delivered and the messengers return. 2 days there and 2 days back. Then we move on. But why do we wait? And why should we give everything we've worked for to a brother you haven't seen in years? He's been with me every day I've been gone. I cannot take you to the land God promised us until I make peace with Esau. Why not? Once, a long time ago, I wronged Esau. I endured my trials to prove to God that I wanted to atone, that I learned the lessons that he sent me. You understand that, but does Esau? (Tzurim) Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! Tzurim? Jacob! What happened? Why are you back so soon? Your brother, Esau. He must have known you were coming. He'll be here by daybreak with a band of armed men. [Tzurim panting] Split up into 2 groups. Divide the goods and flocks equally. Then, when I give the order, one group will follow Rachel and half my sons, while the other will go with Leah and the rest. Go. God of Abraham and Isaac. Save me, I pray, from my brother Esau. I fear he will come and destroy me, sparing neither mother nor child. Deliver me so that I can fulfill your promise. That my descendants will be like the sand of the sea: Beyond all counting. Who's there? [groaning] Esau? Esau? Who are you? Why are you trying to kill me? If you come from my brother, take this back as my answer: You cannot defeat me! The God of Abraham is with me! Only he can break me! [screams] [panting] Is God with you? Has he deserted me? You! (man) Let go of me. I could kill you if I choose. I won't let go until you bless me. I've not come to bless you, but to make sure that you don't escape. Now, let me go. Not until you bless me. Isn't that why the Lord sent you? Now, give me your blessing! [grunting] What is your name? Jacob! Your name shall no longer be Jacob, But Israel, because you have striven with God as well as with men, and you have prevailed. [groans] Esau. [grunting] Father, what happened? Get back! He must meet me first, alone. [hollers] [baby crying] Brother. Suddenly, I'm his brother again. Why did you run from me all these years? I wronged you. I feared you would take your revenge. It would have been just. Even he admits it. Admits it humbly. I beg your forgiveness. Damn you. I came here to punish you. I wanted to take your possessions and leave you penniless. I wanted to take your people and leave you with no one to love you. I have waited years for this day. But now I'm here. I feel the hand of Abraham and Isaac. I can't harm you. [crying] And these children... They're the children God has blessed me with. God has blessed you, indeed. Now, come with me to Seir and live with me in peace. I sheathe my sword. We need time to rest. To gather ourselves. Go on ahead. We'll soon follow. Very well. You'd better take shelter. A storm is coming. (Jacob) Get ready to leave. Leaving now?
