Home in the morning heat with Big Brent and Africa. Congratulations to Ebony on picking up those tickets for unscrambling Kingston, and speaking of Kingston, I was thinkin' about how happy I am not having to deal with a bitter or crazy baby mama. Now look, ladies, I know Africa's not here to represent y'all here today, but before you start cussing me out in your car, I know some of y'all are probably dealing with a deadbeat baby daddy right now. Look, he can't pick up the kids on this day. He ain't got the money for this, he ain't got the money for that. Look, some of y'all might be bitter too. Let's just keep it all the way 100. Some of y'all are mad that your baby daddy done moved on, right? Don't be mad, be happy that he done found somebody else, but he should be taking care of the kids. And for all those brothers out there that's not taking care of your kids, my man, matter of fact, I can't even call you a man. Come on, fam, you gotta take care of your kids, man. We gonna go there today, man. I wanna hear from baby mamas, I wanna hear from baby daddies today. Hit us up, 313-298-1075, my baby. We are talkin' about child support, right here on Hot 107.5 with the morning heat. What up, though? - [Woman] My baby daddy is terrible, okay? I'm talking about terrible, the worst kind. My son is only five years old, he ain't never been a part of his life. I'm talkin' about never been a part of his life. If you ever find him, you ever see him, put him in jail. - What up though? - [Man] Man, Big Ray, this topic is on point. I just got out of county lockup yesterday. My baby mama went down and said I haven't been paying my child support, and that I was in arrears. - [DJ] What up though? - [Woman] Let me tell you what kinda nigga my baby daddy is. Every time I ask him for some money, this nigga don't never got it. But every time I see this nigga he got on a new pair of shoes, the new Yeezys that came out, flexin' on the Gram, buying bottles, but you don't got no money for the kids, nigga? Why, give me some money! ♪ Happy birthday dear Kya ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ (all cheering) (kids chattering) - Crystal, listen.

What the fuck is you mad about? - Man, you don't answer the phone for your kids in the first place. So what's the difference now? - Oh yeah, ha!

Hey fam, get that wedgie out, bro. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Before we go any farther, let me take y'all back to the beginning, so y'all can see for y'allself how Crystal became my baby mama. Yo mama sucks so much dick, nah, ain't nobody sayin' mama jokes no more. Let's see. Yo daddy suck so much dick. (Kyle laughing) Goddamn, Bruce Jenner. Bruce Jenner your daddy, that's funny in itself. - That's bullshit! You can't get here no sooner? That's like an hour and a half away. I can't wait that long. Fuck! Dunno what the fuck I'm about to do now, man. - Damn, you need some help baby? - You think? - 'Scuse me with your smart ass. Damn, now do you want some help or not? - With my tire, right? - A-duh, what else? Nobody gonna do nothin' to your little scary ass. - I dunno, man.

You got a spare in the trunk or not? - You know what, I think it is one in the back. I hope you know what you doin'. - Pop the trunk! What's wrong with y'all women, always got some smart shit to say. - Ah, shut yo ass up. - So what you gonna do about the tow truck people? You gonna call and let 'em know you're straight? - Actually, that wasn't even a tow company. That was my soon to be ex-boyfriend. - Oh shit. You got one of them hams with cheese, huh? I'm just sayin', if you was my girl you wouldn't be out there for no period of time. I'm stoppin' whatever I gotta do for mine. - Whatever, how you know he wasn't busy or something? - Look at you, taking that for baby boy. Look, hear yourself? Throw the whole nigga away. He ain't special. - Man, whatever. We here. - Damn. Got here quick as hell. I was tryin' to beat everybody. Appreciate the ride. That's my number. Hope to see you.

You still writin' huh? - Told you, it's my ticket out bro. - So you got your segment two yet, or? - Oh my god. - Never mind. Bro, what happened with that girl the other day? - Who, Crystal? - Yeah. - Crystal cool. Real cool. - My nigga, she got any friends? - Cut that bullshit, man. - What, she got a sister? A mama? Everybody got a mama, fam. Titi, what her auntie look like? Her titi probably fine as hell. Bro! ♪ Titi do you love me ♪ Yo! (somber music) - If I could go out, don't you think I'd be getting dressed and ready? This nigga act like he always got somewhere to be. But if I had known it was gonna be like this, I wouldn't, you think I would've did this shit? Girl, then he always talkin' about he got a show, like he a comedian. This nigga not even fuckin' funny. You wanna know what's a fuckin' joke? That check. - Wait, where you goin'? - Out. - Out where? Come on man, I got a show to do. - A show? Boy, bye. Don't nobody care about your little show. You can do that another time. I'm goin' out. - Crystal! - What? - You know what? Never mind, go ahead and go. (somber music) (tools whirring) - Hey, we're gonna talk about gettin' you some of those extra hours next month, okay? I want you to keep up the good work, buddy. - Hey, look. Now what the fuck is this? You can't even give this shit to a kid. Dude, you gotta have another envelope in there for me somewhere, man. - Look, I don't calculate the hours. The time clock does that for you. You know, the machine that you walk up to twice a day? Twice. - 'Sup man. Damn bro! Slow down nigga, where you in a rush to? Bro, yo hips are switchin'. Tired ass. - Thank you for calling Piper's, what's goin' on? Your mom died? I am so sorry, I'm so sorry. No, no, no, no, it's okay, you can just come in an hour later. All right, no, no, no, no time off, you'll be fine. It's just a mom. Okay, have a good day. - Excuse me, miss. Can somebody tell me my check is short? I worked over 40 hours last week. - Can I help you? - I hope so. Somebody gonna have to tell me why my check is 40 hours short. - Okay, first of all I need you to calm down, and respectfully tell me what's the problem. - Look-- - Are you calm? - Miss, I worked over 40 hours last week, and this check is not reflecting the work that I did, and I know good and goddamn well I did more than 86,000 worth of work in this sweat box. - What's your employee number? - [Kyle] 951088. - All right, I'm pulling you up now, let's see. Looks like you've been with the company a while now. - You damn right! I mean, you right I have. What's up with my check? - Well Mr. Brown, it looks like you have a child support order. - [Kyle] A child support? - The notice was received two weeks ago, yep. - I ain't owe no damn child support. - Well, according to the state of Michigan you are on child support. Yeah, we have a signed notice and so we have to deduct your wages. - You serious? As in like you not playin' serious. - Sorry I don't think there's a laugh track. Not joking, you're on child support. We can't help you, I'm so sorry. You need to call Friend of the Courts, and they'll take care of it. Hey, they usually send you a notice. You didn't get anything in the mail? (phone ringing) You'll be all right. Got an employee whose mom just died, she'll be fine too. Hello? Thank you for calling Piper's. You again, honey I said two hours, where you at? - What the fuck nigga, can you knock? - Where the fuck my baby at? - She with my mama. - And fuck knockin', I've been knockin' for over a month now. You've been spinnin' me, you seen me calling you. - Me and Kya been busy. - Man, Kya two years old. What the fuck is she busy doing, watching "Paw Patrol?" - It's late, Kyle. What do you want? - You know what the fuck I want. Crystal, you put me on child support. Since when don't I take care of my child? - You the one that missed the hearing. - What hearing? Nobody told me about no fuckin' hearing! - Kyle, they sent mail to your house. If you checked it, maybe you would've known we had court. - Man, what the fuck? What'd you do, dream with the Friends of the Court, wake up and say I'mma take half this nigga check? Oh, I know what it is. You're just tryin' to make my shit more difficult than it already is. - You done? - Hell no I ain't done! - You know what? Maybe you should ask that little girlfriend of yours to help you pay your child support, 'cause them little checks from your job ain't cuttin' it. - Oh I know what it is. It's 'cause baby girl at the party was wifey material. You know what? Fuck you! - Nigga, fuck you! Get your hands off me! - You know what? Nigga, somebody has to you lonely bitch! (somber music) (phone ringing) - [Voicemail] Please leave your message. - Okay, thank you Miss Thomas. - Sound like some bad news, my nigga. - It is, dumbass baby mama done put me on child support. - That shit's fucked up, but hey listen, remember that job opportunity I told you about? It's still available. I just made this in a couple of hours and shit, you know what I'm saying? You don't need no application. - All right, we'll keep that in mind. I could maybe borrow some of the dough. - Nah, I got a job for ya. - Come on, man. (birds chirping) (muffled hip hop music) - What's up, bro? - This dumbass bitch done put me on child support like I'm some fuckin' deadbeat or something, man. Like I don't take care of my daughter. - Man, that shit crazy. I wish one of my baby mamas would try to pull some shit like that. - Bro, I dunno what to do, man. They takin' money out my check, they not lettin' me see my daughter. Man, this shit crazy, man. - Shit, nigga, do what I do. Nigga, I whoop my kids every time I get 'em so she don't ever bring 'em back. Fuck it, nigga. You told that bitch to get an abortion anyway. - Nigga, I'm not you. I gives a fuck about my daughter, man. Real talk. - And I don't? I don't, nigga, I was just tryin' to help. - You good, man, my bad. I just hate that old hairy plastic ass booty bitch, man. - Bro, you noticed that shit too? Nigga, I seen that bitch the other day, nigga, she had her booty braided and shit, and I'm like, it's all right, but you know what I'm saying? I was gonna compliment her, but I thought you would get mad at... - When you see her booty? - Bitch, I'm driving. Nigga, you know LeBron just joined the Lakers, fam? Shit crazy. Anyway, nigga you don't mean that shit, man. She foul, but you don't mean that shit, bro. - Yes I do, man. It's only two things that's gonna make a man hate a woman instantly, bro. - [Man] What's that? - One's callin' the police, the other's puttin' him on child support. Don't fuck with my freedom or my money. You don't do either of those two things, man, and we good. - [Justin] Yeah, touche my nigga, touche. - Yeah I'm gonna be ready. Just call me when you on your way. Money? Yeah girl, you know that hoe ass nigga check just dropped today. (Crystal laughs) All right, just call me. - Now I hope you know I can't keep Kya tonight, because I have something to do. - What you mean? You said you was gonna keep her today! - I did keep her today! Do you know? It is six o'clock and the day is over. I didn't say I was keepin' her tonight. - Ma, it's Tisha's birthday. I'm tryin' to go to the club. - Well you better take her to her daddy, 'cause he wanna see her anyway. Besides, she can even spend the night. - I ain't doin' all that. My baby not goin' over there. - But you, what do you mean over there? That is her daddy. - You know what? I'mma just get a babysitter. But you the one that told me to put him on child support, anyway. - You know, I suggested it. I didn't tell yo silly ass to go do it, and besides, I definitely didn't tell you to keep a little girl from her father. - Whatever. - Mhmm. - Kya, get your bag, we about to go. - Something to do tonight. - [Kyle] Now that's a bitter ugly bitch. (phone buzzes) (phone buzzes) - Wow, okay. Are you really about to go meet this girl for breakfast? - Breakfast, really? What are you talkin' about, baby? - What am I talking about? - Yes. - Why don't you check your phone and see what I'm talking about. I'm talking about your lying, cheating, manipulative ways! It's gotta stop! - Really? You gonna start this? It's too early for this shit, man, come on! - Hunter, just stop! I am so sick of this! I seriously can't keep doing this no more. You think I'm dumb? You out here tryin' to play me like I'm stupid, but I'm not. I know what you're out here doing, okay? You out here messin' with these lil ugly ass girls, trickin' off in these streets. I know what you're out here doin', but that's okay, your fans can have you, okay? I'm straight, I don't want you. - Fans? Who said anything about having fans, like why is you trippin'? - Why am I trippin'? - Yes! - Because I realize that you're never gonna get it, okay? I can't do this no more with you. - Come here, man. - No, don't baby me! I'm straight, I'm good! Fuck you! - Fuck me? - I'm done with this relationship. You can get out of my life, you can get out of my house. I'm done, I don't wanna do this no more. And now, your dumb ass made me late, so thank you. - So it's like that? You just gonna leave? (door slams) Wow, you'll be back. - See what I mean? This is what I gotta deal with. He's never on time. - Shit don't make no sense. - Never. - Thanks for joining us. So before we get started, let's keep in mind that we're here for Kya, and what's in her best interest. - With all due respect, that's my daughter, fam. I know what's in her best interest. - What, you don't know shit. - Look, nobody talkin' to you, Miss Man, you can beat it. - Ma'am, you will have to leave. This hearing's for mom and dad only. - I'm here to support my sister. - It's okay, you can go. - I'll see you in the courtroom. - Now, I have a job to do, fam. So who wants to go first? - First, I'll go first. First of all, I thought we was meeting with a Miss Thomas. Now, I don't know how you dress after work, but right now you lookin' like a man, fam. - Insulting me isn't gonna help you, Mr. Brown. - Man, chill out. It was a joke, it wasn't an insult. - That's his problem. He think everything is a joke. That's why we here now. - Bullshit. - Wow. - We're here 'cause you a lonely thot, and I don't want your lonely ass. - Excuse me, like I said from the beginning, we're here about Kya and Kya only. I don't know what Miss Thomas went over with you already. For some reason, she's running late, so we gonna have to start over. - Look man, I can't live off $86 a week. Y'all taking $360 outta my check already, and considering the fact that I got bills, how am I supposed to survive off that? - [Crystal] What bills? - The amount deducted was calculated with a child support calculator. When you didn't show up for your original hearing, the court only had information that was given to us. - Okay, so now what? - Tell you what, I'll give you two weeks. Bring me your check stub, your monthly expenses, and I'll recalculate your payments based on information you provide. - I provided all that information to Miss Thomas already. - Miss Thomas isn't here, so I need new copies for my files. - Y'all work together. You can't get that from her? - No I can't. Mr. Brown, where are you going? Unless you wanna miss another hearing, I suggest you sit down. You still have to see the judge. - Okay Mr. Brown, you filed the motion to have your case heard, so what seems to be the issue? - Sir, my check is short every week and I can't even see my daughter. - To my understanding, you missed your last hearing. Were you thinking about your daughter that day? - No, it's called I didn't know. - Didn't know? Okay, well that's a great way to start this hearing. - Sir, if I would've known, I would've beat you here. But that would've been a breeze considering the fact that you was 1,000 minutes late today. - Watch it, Mr. Brown, watch it. I think you need to get serious. We take the welfare of a child very seriously in this courtroom. So your jokes, and your lil sarcastic remarks is useless. - Judge, he don't take nothin' serious. - Suppose you're right. How do you think we should handle this situation? - Are you serious, Judge? Why you gonna listen to her opinion? This is your courtroom, not hers. You're supposed to be listening to the facts, not side with her. - You're absolutely right, this is my courtroom and I do what I wanna do, Mr. Brown. Is that clear? You want me to listen to you, and you not even man enough, you not even responsible enough to read your mail. I know this court sent over multiple notices, and you expect me to believe you are responsible enough to take care of a child? - I've been taking care of my daughter since she was born. When and how I'm opening my mail has nothing to do with me as a father. - Miss Sampson, how long has this man been in his child's life? - I mean, since she was born. - But that don't make him special, though. - Man, shut your water balloon headass up. - What? - Be quiet in this courtroom! Let's get on this hairline you got, sir. We gonna get on this good hairline you got. Bosleys ain't gonna help that there, sir. - Wasn't even talkin' to you. - Who was talkin' to you? How about you sit there and mind your business? - What you think this is? You little Bobby Brown lookin'-- - I don't even know you. - [Judge] Hey, hey! I say order in this court! - Shut up! - Ma'am, your hairline ain't up to the front either, now. I'mma hold both of y'all in contempt for the way you look. Your tracks is showin'. - Man relax fam, relax. - Boy, hey. I'mma hold your hairline in contempt, one more word. (Crystal snickering) - Sir, I've been takin' care of my daughter since she was born, and I'm paying child support and can't see my child. Who is that supportin'? Not Kya. - Mr. Brown, I will grant you parenting time every weekend, all right? Every weekend. Fridays at six p.m., you are to pick up your daughter from Miss Sampson in a public place. Miss Sampson, I don't advise him coming to your home. Mr. Brown, you are to have Kya back on Sundays at six p.m. so she can go back home with her mother, is that clear? - Yeah. - Miss Sampson? - Yes, Judge. - [Judge] Is there anything else we need to discuss? - No, Judge. (gavel bangs) (gentle guitar music) (woman sighs) (phone ringing) - Damn, you okay miss lady? - Excuse me? - Are you good? I mean, I'm pretty sure that cellphone ain't do nothin' to you. - Long day. - Long ass day. I bet your day wasn't as bad as mine. I've been in court all morning long, battling my bitter baby mama tryin' to keep my daughter away from me. And then I had to come right back down here to get information that I already emailed to this Miss Thomas lady. And then this judge? He wasn't hearing nothin' I had to say. It's like this child support shit, is designed to make a nigga fail. - Are you Mr. Brown? - Yeah, why? Is it written on my forehead? - I'm Miss Thomas. I'm really sorry I couldn't make your hearing this morning, so I guess I'm the one that's to blame, you know, for your shitty day. - Hell yeah, you damn right. That Mr. George, the Tyler the Creator, 50 Tyson lookin' ass nigga? Man, he full of shit. - He's okay, I mean he just takes his job seriously, that's all. - I see. That Judge Martin, I think that's his name? Tall, black, and he tough as hell? - Yeah, that sounds exactly like Judge Martin. He's a real ladies man, too. I mean, all the women in his courtroom love him. - What about you? - No, I mean I might fall for scum sometimes, but Judge Martin's my boss, and I choose to stay away from mess like that. So let me guess, the entire hearing consisted of him asking her what she wanted to do, right? - Man, hell yeah. - Yep, well, you win. Your day was definitely worse than mine. Good luck with everything, Mr. Brown. - Whoa, where you goin'? - Back to work. - Come on, at least have another coffee or something. I mean, it's the least you can do since you missed my hearing this morning. - You know, I don't think that's a good idea. - Why not? I ain't scum. I'm a good guy. - I didn't say you were, but you're battling what seems like a really messy custody situation, and I just don't wanna complicate things. - Look, this my number. Hope you use it. - Okay well, good luck Mr. Brown. - Thank you, Miss Thomas. (gentle piano music) - Kyle, my baby, my brother, what's happening? - B, I've been waitin' for you for over an hour now, man. - My bad! I was at the club with Big T. He was over there shuttin' that thing down. He get love over there, B. He get love. - Big T? - Big T. - Man, come on, are you serious man? Why you ain't got me over there, man? You know I'm ready, man, come on! - Look Kyle, I listened to your material. I read your material, and quite frankly? It ain't shit, B. It ain't shit. Aight, you need a little more experience. - Experience? Man, that's bullshit and you know it. You said you liked my material, man. - I do, I do. But look, it's not gonna be a bunch of mes in those seats. - So what you tryna say? Big T over there sellin' seats, man? - He not exactly sellin' seats, you know, but he do got a following, you know? People like him, he got a crowd. You know, look, this what I'mma do for you. I'mma help you out. You take your material, wrap it up, and throw that shit out the window. Throw that shit out the window, and when you get some new material, come holler at me. (engine roaring) (phone buzzing) T! I was just talkin' about you baby, just talkin' about you, T, just talkin' 'bout you. (knocking) (pounding) - Damn bro, you ain't hear me knock? Woo, did you hit the lottery or something, nigga? Like these, Rent-A-Center? My nigga. What's up with you, fam? - Shit, what's the word bruh? - Shit, how'd that court thing go? - Man, a bunch of bullshit. - Man, damn. Lemme tell you what happened with me and my baby mama though, fam. - Which one? - Miscarry the one, the bitch that thinks she a G. - Man, what happened bro? - Bro! (birds chirping) - Did it hurt? - Bitch, you childish as fuck, what the fuck is you doing over here? - Can I get some food to go with this oil? - Some food? Bitch, you need to put that shit in your mouth, maybe you'd suck dick better. - Boy, that's cool, you ain't shit but a deadbeat no way. - A deadbeat? I don't even know if that little nigga mine. You see this, you see this? That little nigga hairline is immaculate. - You know I'm part Cherokee. - This bitch sayin' she's part Cherokee, you wanna be a G so bad you ain't even thinking. - Man, it's cool. Shut yo ass up, pick that dirty bitch up off the ground. - Fuck you, bitch, get the fuck off my property before I have my mama call the police on your headass! Fuck! - Nigga, are you serious bro? - [Justin] Yes bro, that bitch is crazy as hell. - So what you doing, you left her on the ground? - Sure did. - Man, you a nut.

I don't have to see you until Friday. - [Crystal] What's wrong with you? Look, Kya daycare bill is due. - Okay, and? Take it out the child support money. - [Crystal] I already used that for clothes. - For your clothes, or for hers? - Yours. - [Crystal] Excuse me? - Look, I get paid, I mean you get paid Friday. - Bitch. - So, you gonna have the money, just make sure you at the meeting spot on time. - Ah, that's what I'm talkin' about, man. Fuck that bitch, bro. She probably playin' you anyway, usin' that money for some damn ass shots or something, man. Shit, that's why I don't trust these hoes out here. Know what I'm sayin'? My baby mama called me the other day talm 'bout can you get me some diapers? I put them bitches on layaway. (both laughing) - Nigga, you a fuckin' fool. - Bro, what I tell you about calling me a nigga? You don't see this good ass Indian hair right here in my beard? - Nigga, that's the coochie hair. You ain't no damn Indian, you's a nigga, nigga. (Justin laughs) (kids chattering) (birds chirping) There she go. That's Daddy angel, come on baby. What you doin', come on, let's go. Come on, we'll go with Daddy. Psh, nice car. - Whatever, nigga. You just be on time droppin' her off on Sunday. - As long as my check on time.

What we doin' today? Wanna go to the bounce house? - Damn, that bitch fine! Fuck. - Watch your fuckin' mouth. - My bad, bro. She is fine, though. 'Bout to go in there with her, fam. - Nigga, you don't even go into the bounce house with your own kids, man. Now why you gonna ruin that lady's good time with her kids? - Man, forget them kids, bro. I'm tryna bounce on her. - Speakin' of kids. - Here we go. - I thought you was bringin' your daughters to come through to play with Kya, man. - Fuck that, I mean, I changed my mind. I ain't got time for that daddy-daughter shit. They get to callin' you, wanna hang out. I'm cool. - That's crazy, bro. I couldn't imagine spending my time with nobody else, man, outside of Kya, nobody bro. You gonna wake up one day. It's like my OG said, bruh, you're a child once, but you an adult forever. You gonna wish you had that time back, man. - Oh I'm woke. I just ain't tryin' to pick them up and all that, man. They cool at the crib with they mama. - Dog, you crazy. Well look, I'm about to go have a good time, and spend some time with my daughter, something you ain't gonna never know nothin' about. - Ha, I ain't tryin' to, goddamn it. Hey, but you need a ride, or you good? - No, I'm cool man. I'll probably grab an Uber or something. - All right fo sho. Hey, real quick, When you go in there, can you tell my nigga's baby mama I say what up, though? Appreciate you, fam. (pleasant music) (kids chattering) (kids laughing) (phone buzzes) - Wow, yeah right. You think I'm playing with you? This nigga thinks somebody playin' with him, like, what don't you get? I'm done with your cheating ass, I'm done! Matter of fact, look out with that. (upbeat music) (kids chattering) (kids laughing) Well all right then. - Hey, here you go. - Hi mama. What's this on her face? - Man, what you talkin' about? - Kyle, what the fuck is this on her face? What you have her sleepin' on some dirty ass sheets or something? - Man, calm down. All my sheets clean. That's not where she got that damn rash from, she could've got it from anyplace. Is she allergic to something? Is there something you not tellin' me? - No, she not allergic to nothing. - [Kyle] You're sure? - I'm her motherfuckin' mama, Kyle. I'd know if she was allergic to something. - Look, I don't know where she got this rash from. - That's bullshit! Now I'm gonna have to be sittin' with her for hours at the doctor's office, tryin' to figure out what this is on her face. - I can sit with her, it's my baby. - That's not the fuckin' point! - You ain't got no fuckin' point cussin' at me like that. That shit is uncalled for. I don't know where she got that damn rash from. - You need to get all that together and tell it to the judge, because if you don't know where this rash came from, then you obviously wasn't fuckin' watching her! - Man, that's bullshit! You just tryin' to stop my parenting time, why? 'Cause she like me more than she like you? - Kyle, fuck you. - Stupid ass, fake ass, Tia and Tamera lookin' motherfucker, man. - You good? - Hell yeah. Come on man, pull the fuck off. (engines rumbling) - Yeah girl, I cannot wait to turn up tonight. It's gonna be a good night! (phone ringing) Oh, hold on. What, Crystal? What, a rash? Hold on, did he take her over to Justice mama house? 'Cause you know Justice mama is nasty. Okay look, either way you gotta take her to the clinic. Yes, the clinic, she could have booty dust on her face, or she done got into Kyle's just for me shit. Either way, she gotta go to the clinic! Look, I'm about to get me some more ammo, and I'm gonna meet you up there. Girl, how much longer? I think my niece got rabies again. - Bitch, what? - [Server] Who had the turkey chops? - Oh that'd be me. - [Server] Okay, and salmon and rice? - Yeah, thank you. - [Server] You guys need anything else? - Can you actually grab a few napkins please? - [Server] Absolutely. - Thank you. - So. Miss Thomas. So what made you call me? - Stop, it's Brianna. - Oh snap. I get to call you Brianna, huh? - Well, we're not in my office, and this clearly has nothing to do with work, so yes, call me Brianna. - Okay, Brianna. So what made you hit me up? - I was thinkin' about you. - Oh, you was thinkin' about me, huh? Let's see here. She loves me, she loves me not. (Brianna laughs) She loves me not. - You are so crazy. - Oh shit, she loves me. No, I'm just playing. I'm glad you called, but I ain't think you was gonna use the number, honestly. - [Server] Here you guys go. Do you need anything else? - No, this is perfect, thank you so much. - Thanks. - Well, don't be mad, but I actually threw it in the trash. - What? - But then I went back and I got it, so. - You threw my number in the trash? So what am I, the trash man now? Oh, lemme see here. - Sorry. - She loves me not, damn. - Oh my gosh, stop saying that. I do love you. - Whoa, whoa. - I mean (laughs) no, I didn't mean it like that. - Okay, okay, slow down, slow down, slow down little miss thot box. I think you're pretty and all that, but that's a little too soon for you to be telling me you love me, don't you think? - Whatever, you know what I meant, okay? You got some jokes. - But nah, all jokes aside, seriously I'm glad you called. - So, how's your daughter and the whole child support situation? - She good. My baby mama on the other hand gettin' on my damn nerves. - [Brianna] Really? She can't be that bad, can she? - You don't know her like I know her. First of all, she bitter. She love to argue. You know how y'all women are. - Excuse me? I don't like to argue. - I don't like to argue either, but it is what it is. So this past weekend, picked my daughter up, and when it's time to take her back to the meeting spot, before I get a chance to say anything, baby mama on my head, making a scene about this rash Kya got on her face. - [Brianna] A rash, where'd she get the rash from? - I have no idea. All we did this weekend was we went to the bounce house, and then we chilled for the rest of the weekend. - Oh, okay, that's where she got the rash from. - What, my house? I mean it may look like a jungle sometimes, but you can't get no rash there. - No, the bounce house. That's where she got the rash from, the bounce house? Those things are really dirty, and they never clean 'em, or disinfect them. I mean, do you know how many kids jump around in those things every day? It's really disgusting. - Damn. I didn't even think about that. But now she's trying to stop my parenting time. - Well, she can't do that. Only a judge can discontinue parenting time. - Well guess what, I'm fucked, 'cause Judge Martin hate me. - Yeah, he's hated me my whole life, so. - What? - What? Nothing. You like your food? - This food good. - [Brianna] Yeah, it looks good. Did you wanna try some of mine? - Sure. I like that. - It's good, right? - Yeah. - Yeah.

Mr. Brown, you filed yet another motion, so tell me, what is the problem? - Good morning, Judge. How you doin' today? - Get to the point, Mr. Brown. I'm sure everyone is having a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious day. - Well sir, I filed this motion because I haven't seen my daughter in almost a month. I was awarded parenting time to see my daughter every weekend, but this, she hasn't been to the meeting spot in over three weeks. - Is this true, Miss Sampson? - Well Judge, last time my daughter was with her father, he brought her home with this huge rash on her face, and when I asked him where it came from, he couldn't even tell me. Rashes like that don't pop outta nowhere. - It didn't just pop outta nowhere. - I wasn't talkin' to you. You'll get your chance. Go ahead. - Thank you, Judge. Like I was saying before I was interrupted, I asked him where the rash came from, and he just started yelling at me in front of our daughter. He just insisted on creating this scene at the restaurant. - Mr. Brown, can you tell me what happened to your daughter's face? - Sir, I took my daughter to the bounce house to have fun. It's what she wanted to do. How was I supposed to know they didn't disinfect and clean these bounce houses? I mean that's gotta be where she got the rash from, and as far as kids, kids play in these bounce houses 24/7. People bring their sick kids to the bounce houses. If I'd have known that, I'd have never brought my daughter to the bounce house in the first place. - Did you tell her mother that? - I tried to, but soon as I started to say something she started yelling and screaming, making a scene. - Well you all met at the restaurant, correct? - [Kyle] Yes sir. - Were there people at this restaurant having a meal? - I don't know how many people was eatin' at the restaurant. - But it was the middle of the day, correct? - Yeah it was, but-- - So it's fair to say that customers were trying to enjoy a meal, correct? - I guess you could say that. - I am saying that. - [Kyle] Okay. - She asked you about a rash, and you decided to disturb these customers while they were having a meal, that's disturbing the peace. - No, actually I was more concerned about my daughter, whether or not I was concerned about if people was ordering hamburgers or double cheeseburgers. What other people eat don't mean shit. I wasn't concerned with that. - You will respect this courtroom, and watch your mouth! This is the last time I will tell you to respect my courtroom. My courtroom is not a place for your jokes. There will be no laughing, no smiling, no none of that in my courtroom, do you understand Mr. Brown? As much as I would love to take away your parenting time, Jack, as I have decided not to, wait, you get it, you get it? Jack ass? (Judge laughs) Now that was funny! (Judge laughs) Miss Sampson, I am ordering you to meet this man every weekend so he can spend time with his daughter. And that's the order of the court. I should do standup. Oh, have a nice day, Jack, I mean Mr. Brown. - See you got little mama today, bro. What you got up later? - Probably nothin', man. Got Kya all day today, you know? I don't drop her off until tomorrow. - Why you wanna be daddy of the year so bad, you ain't even thinkin'? - Nigga, you need to spend some time with your own little girls. - What? Nigga, I will. One day, goddamn it. But for now, about to dip. Gonna be somebody daddy. I ain't talkin' 'bout no little girls, nigga. - Oh man, I get what you're saying. (ominous music) (dog snarling) (Kya screaming) Kya! Kya, Kya, hey come on, just get off, come on. Shoo, shoo, Kya, you okay baby? Are you okay? (Kya screaming) - I just gave you $30 last month! What more do you want from me? All right, I'll be over there when I get off, all right. Paying that. Bro, what the fuck? What's wrong with you, man? I ain't seen you since the whole dog incident. How Kya doing? - She's straight. She better than what I thought. She got some scratches and bruises man, but you know Crystal gonna make a fuss about anything, bro, and I gotta go back to court next week. - You should've known that was coming, bro. I'm just glad little mama all right, though. But now that I think about it, it just seemed like that dog wanted to play. You know what I'm saying? It wasn't tryin' to hurt her. - Fam, play or not man, that judge ain't playing with me. - [Man] Damn, you talk to Brianna? - Man, what the fuck Brianna gonna do? This judge hate me man, and I gotta go to court next week. - I'm prayin' for you, my nigga. - What prayer gonna do man, but whatever. Pray twice. - Call this bighead bitch back. Bitch, you got me at work cryin' and shit man, what we gonna do? - Calling the case of Sampson and Brown. Can you switch please? Miss Sampson, you're the plaintiff in this case today. Thank you. All right now, Miss Sampson, you filed a motion to have Mr. Brown's parenting time revoked. Why is that? - Well Judge, you know the first time he brought her home, she had that big rash on her face. Now, I can understand that that could've possibly came from the bounce house. But this time, when he brought her home, she had scratches all over her face. When I asked him what happened, he said that a pit bull jumped on my baby, and that she fell. I really don't feel like my daughter is safe while she's with him. - Sir, the dog was harmless. Yeah, some cuts and some bruises, but the dog never bit her. - I had to take my daughter to the hospital. That doesn't sound harmless to me. - Well exactly what type of injuries did she sustain? - Well, I have some pictures if you'd like to see 'em. Now if you look at that third picture, you can see that she is bleeding. - Mr. Brown? Lookin' at these pictures don't look like the dog was harmless. Did she have to get stitches? - Yeah, but only two sir. - Any amount of stitches is not considered harmless, Mr. Brown. What happened to the dog? - He ran away after he took her toy. - After looking at these photos, Mr. Brown, you tell me why I should continue parenting time? Do you realize your daughter could have been severely injured? - Yeah, but she wasn't. - [Judge] She wasn't this time, but what about next time? - There won't be a next time. - How can you be so sure? Excuse me? I said how can you be so sure? - I can't, but-- - Just, that's not the response I was looking for. I was looking for a response like, I never have my daughter around dogs, or I would die before I let my daughter be within the vicinity of another dog. - But Judge-- - Just stop! Stop talking! I've already made my decision. - You made your decision before I even opened my mouth. - [Judge] And what decision is that? - It don't matter, she's not takin' my daughter from me. - Lemme tell you something. Dogs kill people. Dogs kill kids. Have you been watching the news? Kids gettin' mauled by dogs, you've left me no other choice. I have no other choice but to terminate your parenting time, Mr. Brown. And that is the order of this court. - You dirty bitch. You know what? You gonna see how you keep them crusty ass toes did, I ain't payin' you shit else. Put some lotion on them heels. - Yeah, we'll see. - Call in the next case. Smith and Wesson? (somber music) - Wrong tool. Damn Sam, don't be comin' up in here lookin' like that on your day off. - Boy, stop. - Say, do you want to go to the movies? - Nigga, you wish. - Bro, you seen Sam? Coming in here lookin' like a Samantha. Still the wrong tool. - Hey look, bro. - 'Sup? - My bad about the other day, man. - Don't even worry about it, fam. I know you under a lot of pressure. Don't even sweat it. My G. Sorry to hear about what happened in court too, man. I know you love the hell out that little girl. - Yeah man I do, but what do I do about it, man? It's probably the best decision. Judge Martin was probably right, man. - What? Man, that judge don't know what's right for your daughter, nigga. - Yeah man, but what can I do about it now? - Hey, want me to hire a hitman? - [Kyle] You don't know no damn hitman. - You got me fucked up, nigga, I do know a hitman. Nigga, what time is it bro? About time for lunch, man. - Look, you mind if I grab a ride with you later on? - Yeah, my dog. - All right. - I'm hungry as hell. Hey bro, it's lunchtime man. We ain't doin' shit anyway. Sam, you still here for a reason, what's up? - And what's that? - Trying to leave with you, we'll go to that movie. - Boy, bye. - Boy you just don't quit, do ya? - No, hey bro ain't that your girl? - Yeah it is man, look. I'mma hit you up later, we gonna grab a drink or something all right? - All right, for sure. - All right. - Hey baby, what's up with that booty? I mean that movie? - Hello. - Hey, what's up? What you doin' here? - Kyle, I've been trying to call you. Why are you avoiding me? - Nobody ignoring you, I just don't know what to say. Seeing how your boss did me the other day. - Yeah, I did, but I know I can help you. - Help me how? You heard what he said. I can't even see my daughter. - Kyle, it's not the end of the world. You can file a grievance against his judgment. I know that's gonna help. - So why you just didn't tell me that? - Hello? You've been ignoring my calls. - Look, I haven't been ignoring you, it's just that-- - Stop. I get it, it's okay.

Judge Martin is my daddy. - What the fuck do you mean, daddy? Daddy like sperm donor daddy, or come fuck me, daddy? - He's my father! We're not close, we never have been! - So why the fuck you just didn't tell me this shit before? - Before what? - Before you start callin' me daddy. - I know I should've told you sooner. I started to, but I didn't think we would get this far. - Baby, what? This is the fuckin' dog that fuckin' attacked my daughter. Are you fuckin' serious? - [Brianna] Wait, no, this is my dog. This is Dino. I've had him since I was a kid. - Well Dino attacked my fuckin' little girl. - [Brianna] What? - And how did he get outside my house in the first place? Did you tell your daughter, did you tell your dad where I stayed at? Is this why you wanted to come to my house? - [Brianna] No! What, I would never do that to you Kyle, are you serious right now? - Man that's fuckin' bullshit, and you know it. I guess the joke is on me, huh? I'm the ass clown. Here it is, thinkin' you're the one that's helping me save my daughter, and it's because of you I lost her in the fuckin' first place! - [Brianna] Kyle, I would never do that to you. You have to listen to me. I would never do you like that. - That's fuckin' bullshit! You planned this. Your father planned this, and you planned this. I'm fuckin' out. - Kyle! Wait! - You know what? You the one who deserve an Emmy, not me. - [Brianna] What? (somber music) - Mr. Brown, is it? - You know my name, just like I know what the fuck you did. - Excuse me? I'd watch myself if I were you. - I ain't gotta watch shit. We not in your courtroom, Mr. Martin. - Watch yourself, son. - I ain't gotta watch myself, you watch yourself. Y'all planned this shit from the beginning, taking my daughter from me, why? Because you want my baby mama 'cause I'm fuckin' your daughter. Yeah. I'm a damn good father, and you know it. But you know what? Judge or not, you will never be the man that I am. If it wasn't for my daughter, I'd fuck your ass up right now. - Bri, I just ran into your little friend outsi, Bri? Bri, what's wrong? - How could you? How could you do that? Dino could've hurt that little girl! - Dino isn't vicious. You know, he just wanted to play. - This is a new low, even for you, Daddy. I don't even wanna know how Dino got over there. (emotional music) You know what? My entire life, I have sat there and I've been silent. I have never questioned you, or your authority, in or out of the courtroom. I have watched as you made horrible decisions. I've watched as you've flirted with every girl that came in and out of that courtroom, right in front of me. I've had your back, and I've been loyal to you, why? Because you're my father? Because you're my boss? You never told me you were proud of me. You've never said you were sorry for all the things that you've done. That you made me do! I just can't stand by anymore while you hurt people, and make these bad decisions that change people's lives. That little innocent girl doesn't deserve to be taken away from her father. I just can't do it anymore. I can't do it anymore, Dad. That's why I told the one person I know you're afraid of. - You wouldn't. - Yes, I would. And I did. I told my mama what you did, just now on the phone. Now you're the one with baby mama drama. You know what, you might wanna get home, because you know what's gonna happen if she has to come lookin' for you. (emotional music) - What you watchin', mama? Got some pizza. - I want my daddy. - Aww. (emotional music) - What's up? - Hey buddy, I talked to Miss Tillman, and I can get you some extra hours if you need 'em. - Okay, I'll let you know. - All right, thanks. (emotional music) - Man, you got us back in court again, with this clown. Man, you did something terrible-- - Can you stop, can you stop? - No, this is ridiculous. - Why do you always do this? - Me? You got us here, we here for you! - Kyle. Can I talk to you for a minute? - Psh, no. - Headass. - What, nigga? - Damn nigga, you straight, is you good? - Idiot. See what I'm talkin' about? Stupid, go ahead, I'm gonna wait out here. - You sure? - I'm positive. - All right. - Go ahead. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - So, Mr. Brown, you filed a petition to have your case reopened. I looked over the case before comin' out here. You filed several motions? - Yes sir. It's been a while since I've seen my daughter. I'm a good father, just don't know what else to do. - I have a letter here from Judge Martin. He's recommending your parenting time be reinstated. According to this letter, he think you a good father. Mr. Brown, are you still employed? - Yes sir, I'm at Piper Automotives. - So, Mr. Brown? This is what I'm gonna do. I'm going to reinstate your parenting time. - But Judge. - Miss Sampson, if you have any objections I will hear from you shortly. - That's the thing, Judge, I don't have any objections. I actually wanna terminate the order of support altogether. I think that me and Kyle can co-parent. - Are you sure, Miss Sampson? You do realize your child support payments will be terminated as well. - Yes sir. - Do you understand what co-parenting means? - Yeah, it means that me and Kyle will have to work together to make the best decisions for our daughter, without the help of the courts. - Do you think you can handle that, Mr. Brown? - Yes, yes sir. I can handle that. - Miss Sampson, stop at the clerk's and sign all the necessary paperwork on your way out. - Thank you. - You know if this was a brother something like Johnnie Cochran, maybe he could even get your kids back, man. - What, you know damn well I don't want my kids, nigga. What type of shit you on? - What's wrong with you, man? - I don't want my motherfuckin' kids. - Let me holler at him for a minute. I'll see you in the car, okay? - Fo sho. - Judge Martin, mind if I talk to you for a second? - Oh. Okay. - Sorry about that. Think I owe you an apology, man, for the way things transpired. - You know what? - It's going down, nigga. I'm just gonna take the stairs. - I owe you an apology. I know all too well about baby mama drama. - So we good, no hard feelings? - Yeah man, we good. - Hey bro. Ain't you Officer Jackson from the white movie? - Man, time's up, man. - I knew it was your headass. Boy, you somethin' else. Just met a celebrity. Call my baby mama real quick, man. Hello? Who the fuck is this? Oh what's up son, where your mama at? Nigga, this your daddy. Justin. Chh. What's up girl, thought you had another nigga answering your phone or somethin', he sound grown as hell. High school? Damn, when that happen? What high school he go to? You know what, never mind. Look, I wanted to come by there later, maybe we could talk, talk some things out about these kids, work something out, you know what I'm sayin'? You gonna be at home later? All right, cool. All right. High school? Got some groceries for the baby. - Thank you. - I wanted to talk to you because, I was wondering if maybe we could co-parent? - Co-parent? - Yeah, co-parent is like when two parents come to an agreement to find out what's best for the-- - I know what it is, Justin. I like that. - Me too. - Yeah. - Bring it in? Come on now. Better not have no niggas around my baby, either. Don't play that shit. (birds chirping) - How you doin'? - I'm good, how are you? - Doin' good. I think I owe you an apology. This was totally out of character. I just was goin' through something. - Kyle, I'm the one that owes you an apology. What my father did was wrong, and I'm sorry. - Don't even trip. I got somebody I want you to meet.
