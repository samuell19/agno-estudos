Film restaur? en 2019 par La Cineteca di Bologna/L'Immagine Ritrovata et le World Cinema Project de The Film Foundation Restauration financ?e par la George Lucas Family Foundation THE WOMAN WITH THE KNIFE This woman is a double from the afterlife. Every person on earth has a double in the world of the dead. Usually, they are the same sex as their earthly counterpart. But sometimes, as in your case, they may also be of the opposite sex. And that creates emotional problems. These doubles are very jealous. This woman, aside from her bouts of jealousy, is a guardian. She protects you from any danger that might befall you. You must learn to understand her and accept her ways. For she is very demanding. Do not fear her. Her presence is beneficial. But I don't want to influence your decision. If she scares you so much that you never want to see her again... you'll never see her again. But if you want to see her more and strengthen your bond... I can help that to happen. Before we begin, I'd like you to weigh up the pros and cons... because once the work is done, I cannot undo your decision. So think it over for a few days. This is all so silly. I can hardly believe it myself. And yet I know I saw her. She came towards me... with a knife in her hand. It's quite possible, and I take your word for it. The surprising thing is that I instinctively went to the witch doctor. It's a side of me that I wasn't aware of. I was so sure that I had left superstition behind. And then, at the first sign of trouble I run to the witch doctor for comfort. It's embarrassing. You know, if you'd gone to a shrink, he would have talked nonsense too. Let's be honest, at least there's a certain romance about seeing a witch doctor. You did what any scared person would: we cling to our beliefs. What matters is what you feel, what you yourself believe. This vision has shocked you. Find out how it relates to your past. Are you able to take control of the situation? Control? Control what? I don't even know what I'm afraid of. Well, perhaps. Maybe once I collect my thoughts. But right now that's impossible. I can't stop worrying about the next apparition... of that double from the afterlife. I'm too scared to take a shower or close my eyes. I'm scared to death. Sometimes when I'm alone, I feel a presence close beside me. The problem is, how do we find out the truth? How do we explain this phenomenon and with what evidence? Where does she come from? Who is she? What does she want from me? - What are you thinking? - Nothing. About what you said. Sir, if you don't know the name of the person you want to see then I can't find him for you. How can you know someone and not know their name? Well, you see it's quite complicated. I was a boy when I knew him but I never knew his name. I used to call him Uncle. He was a family friend. And he has been here for three years? So they say. I'm not from here. I've been travelling. I'll do my best, but don't get your hopes up. Do you see him? There. I recognise him. So it's him, the man with the leather bracelet. Like everyone here, he has a story to tell. Good evening. You don't seem pleased to see me. I have something to give you. Take good care of it. It will be of great help to you. So when I got there, I was still very innocent. One day a friend said, "Time to pop your cherry!" They took me to a brothel. Brothels over there aren't like ours. They're beautiful houses. Inside, they have thick carpets and mirrors all over the walls. Like palaces. So they took me there. We went in and were greeted in the lounge. They showed us pictures of the women to choose from. When you've made your choice the girls are called in. Boy, did we have fun! We drank the finest wines, ate wonderful food and danced. The girl I picked... She was a real beauty. Her chest was like this! And her eyes... When she looked at me and she raised her eyebrows... a shock ran through me and I wanted to ravish her there and then! She was fantastic. Her name was Lili. Was she white? Of course. It's their country. All the girls are white. Who do you think work the fields, wait tables and sweep the streets? White people. There are rich and poor people. The poor are just like here, but the rich are richer than you have ever seen. Over there, the rich people are seriously rich. Have you been to Paris? Do you know France too? That's not quite how it works. Paris is a city and France is the country. Like here, Ivory Coast is the country and Abidjan the city. I've been to many cities. I know Marseille, Toulon, N?mes, Fr?jus, Bordeaux... and Paris, of course. And plenty more. Will you ever go back there? To live in those countries you need a lot of money. And I've got none. You must go when you're young. That way you can learn all kinds of things. Just by walking through Paris, for example, you learn French history. Good evening. Don't move. Sit down. May I sit? I am your wife from the hereafter. Don't be so impatient. You'll destroy the love that is growing between us. You cannot touch me. I am only the light by which you can see me. Like a flame you long to touch, it will burn you or you'll snuff it out. You must wait until I materialise. Until I physically come to life. The other night, I gave you my leather bracelet. It will be the only material thing that you possess of me while you wait. I must leave you now. Sleep well. I will come back. It will be a surprise. See you soon. Let me go! I'll smash your face in! I'm not a "darkie"! I've been to Paris and Marseille. You're a disgrace! I won't be bullied by fools like him. Good evening. Don't be afraid, it's me. Don't move. I will stay close to you today. I told you it would be a surprise. I've come to tell you, you can summon me when you want. Just take the bracelet and I will be there with you. Would you like that? Then just take the bracelet with you, and I will be there. Sweet dreams. Good night. It's so great to be taking this trip together. - What did you say? - I wasn't talking to you. Take us to the veterans' home. Yes, sir. This outing was so important to you, I could hardly refuse to come. You should enjoy it too. I'd feel bad if I thought you were only here for my sake. Of course I'll enjoy it. Don't worry. If you don't mind, I'll just be a minute. I have to drop this at the police station. It's just across the street. Thank you. Good day, officer. There's a strange man in my taxi. He keeps talking to himself, as if there's somebody with him. He's scaring me. I want him out of my taxi. The police shouldn't let these people roam the streets. Are you complaining about a customer or the police? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. But that man is still in my taxi. What do I do? Don't bother me with something so small. Just politely ask him to get out. But he's crazy! He could be dangerous. Alright, don't cry. I'll help you to get rid of him. Wait here. Where has he got to? Taxi drivers are so impolite. Can you believe it? He just gets out and leaves us here! Let's go on foot. That will teach him to abandon us. Here he is, officer. But... where did he go? Is this some sort of joke? Perhaps you think we don't have enough to do? Don't waste my time with this nonsense. I'm so sorry. I swear on my father's life, I had a lunatic on board. Don't mess me around! Where is he? Did he just vanish? Perhaps you're the madman after all. Is everything alright up there? I had a madman in my taxi! A madman, or a ghost. My God! Maybe he's right. WAR VETERANS' HOME Won't you have a drink with me? Here's to love. May I? Bastard! How dare you! Get off me! What did he want? I have no idea. I just picked up that empty chair over there. - Look at what he's doing. - Who is he? I'm sorry, my dear. People can be so rude. They have no respect for others. Inspector, there are dangerous madmen on the loose! It's a disgrace. Do something. This is intolerable, Inspector. Madmen in the street! What about our safety? What are you going to do? I have a big family. My wife and children are in danger. What can I possibly do? What has this poor man done? I can't arrest him without cause. I'm telling you, he's nuts! Today he attacked three people on the caf? terrace. If what you say is true, then we have to act quickly. That changes everything. One moment. What do you want? Let go of me! What an incredible story. Asylums are full of incredible stories. Thank you so much for helping me find him. Sir! Tell him to give me back my bracelet. You refuse, too? What's wrong with them? Has everybody gone mad? Give me back my bracelet! Give me back my bracelet! Sorry, sir... Oh, it's you! Look how grown-up you are! You're a real woman, now. What a sight. Now I remember. You and I used to play together. You've changed too. You've become a real man, with that voice. Yes, but I'm older than you. Yes, and you always used that advantage to beat me. Still angry about that? Of course not. Let's not part like this. Why don't we get a drink? I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting someone. Okay, some other time. Mind if I walk with you? Strange, how long it's been since we saw each other. What are you doing? I'm still in school. Sixth-form. Do your parents still live in the same building? Let's meet up again, and soon. How about dinner? I'd love that. When are you free? I hope you can fit me in one evening. I'm all booked up this week. - Then lunch, tomorrow? - Fine. I'll pick you up from that bar at 12:30. Perfect. 12:30. - How beautiful you've become. - Thank you. I have to go. - Bye. - See you tomorrow. See you soon! - Don't forget. - Don't worry. Why am I giving you my life story? What good will it do you? Don't worry. I'm not a father confessor. That's not my style. I was asking for myself. For yourself? Even if you're happy with your life and the goals you set yourself... you still have to compare them with people you know. You scare me when you look so serious. I'm serious, but there's no need to be scared. I haven't been at my best lately. And to me, you represent reality. You're bursting with life and energy. There's no miraculous reason. It's very simple. I accept life as it comes and find happiness in that. I can't do that, even though I know you're right. You have to take account of society around you, even if you disagree with it. Otherwise reality leaves you behind. I'm terrified of getting left behind. Of missing out. It makes me feel like I'm getting old, dying. That's why I need to see you living. You're reality. You're youthful. Your company makes me feel alive too. You're making life so complicated. These are artificial problems. Not to me. My life depends on it. We should meet again. Would you like that? - If you like, sure. - Thanks. You can always come round. I'm always home after work. - To your place? - Don't worry. I'm a decent man. Here... That's my address. Time to go. Waiter! - Good evening. - How are you? Aren't you ready yet? I'll only be a minute. Don't get angry. I'm not angry. I'm just remarking that you're not ready. Have a seat. While I get ready, how about a drink? What would you like? - Nothing, thanks. - Fine. Up to you. You know, I saw Kofi this morning. - Kofi, who? - The boy who used to live with us. Oh, him. We fought all the time as kids. Honestly, you weren't always very nice to him. What's he doing? He has a family and works to provide for them. Bravo! How touching. We had a chat, talked about this and that... You, for instance. He said you hadn't been in touch for ages. True. He asked if you were still just as strange. How ridiculous! Anyway, he's not the only one. Some people say I'm pretentious. Kofi says you give yourself airs. Well, we don't share the same concerns or hobbies, and we define happiness differently. Well, well... That's odd. I also knew a strange man. When I was a boy, I used to see him on my way to school. In the same spot. There was something odd about him. At least, that was my impression. You know what happened? He went mad. He spent a lot of his life in Europe. When he returned, he couldn't adjust to life here. He spent most of his time in bars, getting drunk and bragging about his Parisian adventures. Back then I didn't realise, but he was one of the first victims of those two worlds colliding. Why are you telling me this? When you mentioned Kofi, it reminded me of this man. All too often people stumble through life. They have no conception of things that exist outside their world. I refuse to live like that. I do not accept the life I've been given. So kill yourself. No, I can't. For two reasons. Firstly, I don't have the courage to do something like that. Secondly, it's against my religion. My own religion, obviously. My life transcends my person. It's part of a greater whole... which I call the energetic element of humanity. That element must evolve to a higher level... which is total perfection, the end, the absolute. I don't know how to explain it. Here's an example. Frogspawn becomes tadpoles... which in turn, grow into frogs again. That's the highest level of that species. Not a single frog can exist without passing through the process of spawn, tadpole, frog. In my case... my life becomes an element in the process that leads to man's highest level of evolution. Because it's necessary, it is therefore essential. Premature death, such as suicide, impedes the natural progress of this evolution. Whether a life is rich or not, fulfilled or unfulfilled, it makes an equal contribution towards that evolution. It constitutes a useful experiment. So you're too chicken for suicide, despite your disenchantment with life? You don't understand but it doesn't matter. - How time flies. - You're right. Back in a minute. I always enjoy taking a walk after dinner. Yes, doctors recommend it. That's why there is often dancing after posh dinners. Just a quick ten-minute session! Look out there. A ship. It travels to other countries, other worlds. I'm so jealous of people who travel. Come on. Poor me! I can't. I'm exhausted. I'm staying here. You can't stay here. Come on. We're almost there. Come on, now. You'll wake everybody up. Wait, I know what to do. See? No need to panic. And there was light. Don't fall asleep. Wake up. Wake up, you wimp! What's going on? Her again, isn't it? You need to rest, you know. The doctor says so. If you're tired and want me to leave, just tell me. No problem. What happened? They found a woman screaming like crazy in your room, and you were out cold. They took you both to the hospital. The woman has already gone home. As for you, you've had a terrible nervous breakdown. They gave you sedatives to let you sleep. You've been asleep for 12 hours. She came back, didn't she? I don't know. I don't remember anything. Everything is happening so fast... that I'm quite dizzy. My God... I wish I could make all this go away. He's delirious. He still has a fever. In a way, it's a good thing that the vision keeps returning. You'll get used to it, and you have to learn not to fear it, now you know it's a hallucination. You must also try to see Mah again. I know it's hard but you have to. There must be a link between Mah and your vision. And you have to find out what that link is. Maybe it's true what you say. But I don't think I can bear to see that vision ever again. Or to see Mah. Give me some time to clear my mind. Don't take too long. It's now or never. There you are! Nice of you to come. You aren't leaving already? Is your glass empty? There's plenty here to eat and drink. Thank you. I have time. The night is still young. Enjoy yourself. You're all alone. Are you bored? Not at all. I'm having a great time. - No! - I have it on good authority. Is it true what they say? What do they say? That you don't like women! That's easy to check. If you'll allow it, I'm at your service. So they arrest the killer, and the superintendent, outraged, shouts furiously at the defendant, "Are you proud of what you've done? "You sexually assaulted her, strangled her and cut up the body. "It's beyond belief." Then the killer shrugs his shoulders, and says, "If you can't even flirt these days..." I'll tell you straight, this country is ours, and we can't put up with being bullied like we were in the past. She says it like a challenge: "Come to my place if you want to meet." So I told her I would visit if she gave me a date that suited her. I went to her house. Luckily her husband was out. After we've had our fun, I go to the sitting room. I've just sat down when her husband comes in. "Finally, there you are!" I say. "I was just passing and dropped in to say hello. "But your wife was shut in her room. I was about to leave." He asked how his wife was. When he heard she wasn't sick, he told her off for not taking care of me. Eventually we broke out the whiskey and had a great time! Still alone? Let's sort you out. I'll find you some company. There are two girls who would love to dance. I don't feel like dancing. Don't be silly. You can't leave them waiting. I'm not in the mood. Come on, you're here to enjoy yourself. No, I really don't want to. I don't believe this. You don't want to eat, drink or even dance. You shun the other guests. Why did you come here? That's true. I just asked myself the same question. Perhaps I should be on my way. Thank you for inviting me. I had a good time. Good bye. You little jerk. I ought to beat you to a pulp. If you weren't my guest tonight... Piss off! And never come here again. You're taking this the wrong way. Such a nice restaurant. - Shall we dance after this? - No. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. You've been acting so strange lately. Like I get on your nerves. My presence seems to annoy you. You're wrong. I'm depressed, that's all. You think I'm a fool? I know you're hiding something. Whatever it is, I expect to be treated nicely on a date. What do you want me to do? Kiss and caress you in public? Keep your voice down. We're not alone. Then stop nagging me. I understand. I don't need you to tell me a second time. Mah, wait for me. Don't touch me. Wait for me! Well, if that's what she wants... Let me in. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. I don't know what you see in a fool like me. - No, wait! - What's the matter? No! Don't come any closer. Kafouri! Kafouri! She's still there! Stay away! Not a step further or I'll beat you! I'm telling you, stay back! What's wrong with you? Did you want to kill me? So that's what it was. Suddenly it's all clear to me. That face is none other than my mother's. But how could it have become so depersonalised? I still remember that day. It was raining. I was sheltering with a girl of my age, by a fence in the corner of the yard. We felt so happy as the rain fell around us... and we felt safe. So we fell into each other's arms. I don't know how they found us. We were well hidden. But I still remember my mother's furious face above us, saying these words: "Little boys who play dirty games with little girls "will be snatched away by Death and never see Mummy or Daddy again." Those words took root in my subconscious... and haunted me every time I fell in love with a girl. All the pretty faces that might lead me to those "dirty games" became obscured by the mask of Death. That fear has taken on the face of the woman who haunts me. Do you understand, Mah? I don't blame you. Quite the opposite. Thanks to you, I have escaped from this nightmare. Mah, forgive me. Don't you believe what I just told you? Calm down. My love, don't leave me. No more crying. It's over. It's the emotion. You acted so strangely. I really thought you had gone mad. - Who is Kafouri? - Kafouri? - Where did you hear that name? - You said it when you called for help. - Really? - Of course. Don't you remember? I don't remember. Kafouri... he doesn't exist. How come? He's a figment of my imagination. My love, did you need all this to fight your loneliness? I always found reality difficult to handle. It hurts me. I can't communicate with my peers. I can't touch them. The contact sears my skin. So I chose an unreal world. In that world I feel alive. That's where I feel like a free man. - Are you that unhappy? - No more than anyone else. To me, it was a way of adjusting to reality. I hope it's all over now. Yes, it is over. What's wrong? Are you sure I exist? And that I will always exist for you? Yes, all my life. Now, I can face reality head-on. With you, I can set out to reconquer the world.
