Toho Co. Ltd Wakai hito Young People Directed by Toyoda Shiro Based on the novel by Ishizaka Yojiro Director: Toyoda Shiro Starring: Oohinata Den: Mazaki sensei Ichikawa Haruyo: Enami Keiko Natsukawa Shizue: Hashimoto sensei Hanabusa Yoriko: Enami Hatsu Yamaguchi Isamu: Sasaki sensei Hayashi Chitose: Hashimoto's mother-in-law Matsubayashi Kiyoshi: Dr. Yamakawa They say the inspector today is very tough. Anyway, it's not nice to be inspected for just 10 minutes and then commented on. I'd like to watch Mazaki sensei's class. Your comment might be sharper than the inspector's. Yes, Hashimoto-san might be. Now you can hear the real sound of the throat. Why did you doodle? Don't call it a doodle. It's not. - Then what is this? - A sketch of my father. But each face is different. What are you doing? Answer me. I drew the pictures of my father which each time came from my heart. I see. You have no... Yamagata sensei said I was born without the blessing of God. I won't scold you anymore. I think Enami-san likes doodling very much. Sensei... Mazaki-kun. You've kept the inspectors for a whole hour. I've never heard the like. We were totally skipped. For an hour I was thinking with students and inspired by students, forgetting the time. I pay respects to the rich experience of teacher Mazaki. All the students were talking freely, as friends, that should be noted as better than in other schools. Except that, it happened I picked up the notebook of a student. I found many doodlings here and there. I hadn't tried to discover her mischief but simply wanted to know how she made notes. I'm afraid the student feels hurt, thinking that she is blamed more than she deserves. I ask you, teacher Mazaki, please put her at ease. I was prepared to be accused, but thank you for your warm words to the student. Please allow me to make an excuse on her behalf. She doesn't believe it was doodling. Unfortunately she doesn't know her father. If I may be so bold, she is an illegitimate child. She drew her father when he came to mind every now and then and wanted to save them. Considering her daily behaviour she suffers from unreasonable persecution due to her unfortunate origin and she has lost her will-power, becoming a robot of emotion, as if God threw her on the experimental table of life. She is no more than a poor guinea pig. Keiko-san. Keiko-san will be an artist. The music and art teachers say you are a genius. It's true. Actually I'm a load of trouble, aren't I? Maybe I made a big speech. I became embarrassed. What do you think? I think you protect Enami too much. I feel your romantic analysis of Enami is quite wrong. She lives a corrupt existence without a sense of real life. The way you protect that girl, I feel is quite useless. You can't say someone is useless because they are a troublesome person. She has her own way of living. She certainly has. But it's the beauty of one who goes to ruin. A hard, momentary beauty. It's a beauty I don't have. In addition, it's a tempting beauty. What? Tempting? Is she something...? No, I just feel so. In fact it's the opposite. Enami can make boyfriends easily. But if a boy tries to get close, she yells violently at him. Maybe such behaviour comes from her life. Sensei, goodbye. Goodbye. If you intend to set her a good example she can become a wonderful woman. But... Can you assure me? Under a certain condition. What is it? Make Enami... your wife. No, I can't. I'm a teacher. Then, it's better to stop favouring her completely. Is that an order? Your lukewarm kindness, neither one thing nor the other, is the worst. But, I would raise her up my own way. Do as you like. Do you know the remark of a certain gambler? "Woman is multifarious, no need to care which woman you favour." Or something similar. Welcome back. Mama. Welcome back. Mama, take me to apologize. - Where to? - To sensei. - Have you done something wrong again? - It's mama's fault. - Me? - Yes, you, mama. You are obliged to apologize. They saw this today. Mama. Yes, I am obliged. - I can come with you. - Can you? Yes. Mama, give me some. Mama, have you ever been happy? Well, I don't know. What is happy? What is unhappy? I've lost the power to think of it. Can a woman only get happiness from a man? Is there no happiness in the world, for a woman being alone? You become quite grown-up every now and then. Well, how can one answer? Listen, mama. Suppose you go heaven and are asked what you've done when you were alive, what would you answer? In heaven? Be honest. Alright. I gave my kindness to many boyfriends equally. I never betrayed anyone. It was suitable for my nature. Therefore no man fought or became unhappy on my account. I'd answer like that. Keiko, is mama a bad woman? I don't know. I like mama. Though I think you are a very good mama, sometimes I think you are a bad mama and I hate you. Oh, you gave your guest some work. Because you don't sew for me, obasan. Yes, I'm an inattentive old woman. It's finished now. - Thank you. - Have you done it? Mama, you can leave. How rude you are. See? That's how she is. Maybe mother spoils her. We are like sisters, not mother and daughter. Mama, leave now. I'll send you to the way out. Just as she said. Sensei, actually she easily gets lonely. Please be kind to her. Hurry, mama. Oh, you are all together. With all our children. Give birth, increase children. Only for that matter, we follow the teachings of God. - Where are you going? - To beat Mazaki-san. Debating again? Excuse me. See? Good shoes, aren't they? How could you know my size? When I was in charge of cleaning, I secretly measured them. I see. We teachers have decided not to accept gifts, but as you are especially troublesome, I'll accept this from you. Hey, what are you doing? See, it's fits perfectly. Sensei's foot is so big. Mine is so small. Smell it. You have oily feet, sensei. But, sensei, in today's class, you were relatively calm with my question. Don't say that. But I was rather startled. I expected you would ask a unique question. Did you? I wanted to see the face of Hashimoto sensei. - What? Hashimoto sensei? - Yes. Why are you so interested. That's funny. Sensei would you like to eat some? Watching you like that, you seem a good, honest girl. However, sometimes you do unbelievable things. Why? I don't know myself. I think strangely. For example, if someone is hiding something, I want to glance in the depths of someone's heart. That's threatening. It's true. Then, do you know my mind? No. You camouflage yourself and don't allow me to see. Do I? No, I don't. Yes, you do. No, I don't. Sure? See? It's a lie. A lie, a lie. Excuse me. Is Mazaki sensei at home. It's Hashimoto sensei. I don't want to see her. Don't worry. Just keep sitting. No problem. Stay. I'll hide here. I'll jump out later. Hashimoto-san, please. Oh, no. Please. You closed the window. It's so stuffy. Because you live this, you are influenced by unhealthy ideas. Welcome. Oh, I forgot greetings. Good evening, forgive me for disturbing you. You wait. You embarrassed me. No, I was afraid we'd be debating again. Yes, I do debate. Take it easy. Would you like some tea. I'll make some. Are these sweets? If so let's eat. It's not a present, it's a book. A book? - Sweets turned into a book. - Don't say that. I was thinking of bringing a present of sweets before I left. But I didn't, because I decided not to associate you with any waste. Is that true? But, meanwhile the way of no-waste like that is dangerous. I don't think a women's beauty should only be intellectual. That's no problem for me. But I still have the gentleness to make tea. A rat? Should I open up and wipe it out? Oh, it's not good manners, sensei. Obasan. Give us some tea. Are you there? I'll treat you to tea. Let's go out. Yes, let's. - The book? - I left it in your room. I brought it to lend it to you. The present is nutrition for the brain. Yes it is. Dear me. Miss. Mama. What time is it? Oh, gee. Miss. Where is sensei? He went out. I'll leave. Shoes. Obasan, goodbye. Look. Nice. Will you wear these on the school trip? I can't walk in Tokyo with black stockings. But is this allowed? But sensei also... Really? Quiet, girls. The chaperone teachers for the school trip were announced. General manager and accountant is Yamagata sensei. General affairs and health, lzumi sensei. I don't like it. Guide is, as we hoped, Mazaki sensei. Quiet. Applause for Enami Keiko-san our ambassador plenipotentiary, who appealed for Mazaki sensei. Bow! Not yet. 5th Grade Tokyo trip group gather at Hakodate ferry boat station Keiko. Sorry I can't see you off. Take care. Is the money enough? Do you want more? No. Take this. No, I don't need money. You can go, father. I told you I'm all right. You'll be late for work. Then take care. People are watching. Please take care of my girl. Take care. Enami-san. There you are. What's wrong? Your eyes are red. No, nothing's wrong. Gee, we were worried. Mazaki sensei came. He overslept. Sorry I'm late. We have to take care of things, do you understand, sensei? Yes I know. Tie or hat should not be crooked. Sensei, time to gather. Mazaki sensei. I have a mother in-law who is living in Tokyo. You have? Then I should have given this messy job to you. Sensei, sensei, it's time. I have no time. Bye. My baby has diarrhoea. That's too bad. Sensei, sensei. A student came to my compartment and started to cry. Is she still there? She said, "I want to cry alone for an hour. Please move away." It's rather strange. I'm sorry. Some students are troublesome. Conductor's compartment Hey, don't cry. What's wrong? I'll get cross. You'll spoil the enjoyment of all the girls with your personal feelings. It's because I have no mother. My mother... We're travelling. No one has a mother here. I don't mean that. I'm talking of my own affairs. Sensei can't understand. If you cry for an hour, conductor-san will be in trouble. How could you cry so hard? You've stopped crying. Sensei, many things came out in my head. That's why I came here. - I discovered something important. - What is it? When I cry the train travels along my cry and flies fast like it's having fun. You seem to enjoy your crying. I begin to feel that I can do nothing wrong. Shall I cry some more? No, that's enough. Octopus, tempura, red string. Open up. Don't joke. Exhausted! Let's have a bath. Hey, don't do loose things. Who says so? Do you want to play riddles? What is that, the more you eat the more it increases? Peanuts! Then, what are 1,000 little boys playing tug-of-war? I don't know. - Do you know, sensei? - I don't know. Natto. Your turn, sensei. - I'm not good at this kind of thing. - Sensei, whatever. All right. Just one. Scary, smelly, and delicious. What is that? You don't know? I'll tell you. Listen. An ogre, in a toilet, eating daifuku cake. Has sensei joined them? I am tired, sensei. I'm exhausted too. Sensei, I'll give you a massage. Oh, are you going to earn a point? No. Mazaki sensei, you have a visitor. - A student's relative? - She said Hashimoto-san. I have no student called Hashimoto. Isn't it Hashimoto sensei. Yes, she said the mother of Hashimoto sensei. Coming. I wasn't particularly asked by Sumi-san. From her letters which she sent me, I guessed unnecessarily. Hashimoto-san and I are colleagues, nothing more than that. Yes, sir. I know that very well. And we are very different in nature. She seems very cool as you see. That originates from her giri obligation to me, I believe. Anyway, the most important thing is her own happiness. That is, I wish her to be a good wife. Anyway, I hope you will be a good adviser for her for whatever. I wanted to ask that, so I visited you like this. Well, Hashimoto-san doesn't need my advice. You are wrong, sir. Woman, after all, cannot do anything easily alone. Maybe it's too rude to tell you this, but frankly, we expect you will be our kin in the future. So, I wanted to see you on this occasion. I will consider carefully. Haven't you gone to bed yet? Leave her alone. Our fun trip came to an end. Gee. Do you know who is the happiest person in the world? You don't know? A person wearing a heavy wedding kimono, with tsunokakushi, sitting in front of a golden folding screen getting a cup of sake for their love. I don't know. Enami-san is trying to avoid Mazaki sensei. Camouflage. I know. What's wrong? I feel sick. Are you alright? Are you very tired out from your trip? No, I was given two days leave. Now I'm fine. I see, very good. I'm in a rush. Thank you. Sorry I kept you so long, sir. Hashimoto-san has many workshop guests. She says she can't meet you now. Alright, I won't disturb her. Give her this. Sensei, this is a present from him. - Did he leave? - Yes. I think it's best to avoid him. Why? I heard from a senior that during the school trip, there was a rumour about Mazaki sensei and Enami-san. You knew, didn't you, sensei? I won't distance myself from Mazaki sensei because of such a rumour. He has no strong beliefs, he is an ordinary paternalist. He's not like me. That's why I tried to clear his friendship with Mazaki sensei. Sensei, are you mad for what I said? - Why? - But... - No. - Really? Great! I like sensei for that. Miyagawa-san. Oosumi-san. Mori-san. Tashiro-san. Enami-san. Enami-san. Absent. Look, Enami-san is leaving. These days, she's often absent. Do you know why? You don't know? It's secret. Wow, really? It's a disgrace to the whole school. You must rest in the infirmary. I'm OK. What's the matter? Because Mazaki sensei is in the room. That's why I don't want to go in. I'm scared. Loose bowels? Are you alright? Yes, thank you. Actually, my reason is this. I see. Prohibited smoking tastes wonderful. It can't be a haiku. - Take one. - No, I don't. You look bad. - Is it so painful? - Yes. My stomach is bad, but I have a much more unpleasant matter. What is it? Recently I have heard frequent rumours among the students. You've heard about it, haven't you? Yes, thank you for confiding in me. As a matter of fact I was quite worried about it. I couldn't believe it, so I ignored it. - Is there any truth in it? - No. The rumour that Enami shows a certain symptom in her body... No kidding! I don't know about Enami's physical condition, but I can say that the rumour concerning me is total nonsense. I can believe it. I know you, I believe you. But if it's not you... I know it's not you. Anyway, Enami is outrageous. Outrageous indeed. That's the end of it, don't you think? They say she has many boyfriends. Do you know? But, I wonder. The doctor is out now. Please wait a while. Keiko-chan, did you enjoy the school trip? Yes. I wish I was a schoolgirl again. Which medicine can kill me with the least pain. There's no medicine for an easy death. You'd suffer more than die of a disease. Oh, the doctor's returned. What's the matter? Is something wrong? Insomnia inherited from a parent? What's the matter? What's wrong? Such a rumour came from your excessive protection of Enami. Can't you understand? You are young. The difficulty of being a teacher in a female school lies there. Enami-san, Tashiro-san. Look at it that way way, you must call them like this. Enami-san. If you do it like that, you'll get jealousy immediately. This is a real nuisance. Being young is not always good. An old teacher like me is much better. The people make light of me in the school though. Mazaki sensei, a call from the school doctor and... Kei-chan. Leave me! How annoying! Everyone suspects me! Don't be silly. If you don't clear the doubt, I'll die! Please, please. I understand. Please, please. Don't worry. Your friends doubt for nothing. There's no need to cry. I'll write the certificate for you. Show it Mazaki sensei and study hard. - Kei-chan! - No... What are you doing? It's a lie. A lie. I can't show such a fake certificate to anyone. Hey, I know. The doctor insults Keiko too. - You made a fool of me. - Don't. She was so excited. We gave her a sedative. Thank you very much. What did the doctor say? He said, don't worry. Enami-san has a certified clean body. Please don't be concerned. Sensei. Oh, you were awake. You exercise well, sensei. But, sensei... I thought you wouldn't care for Keiko anymore. Why not? Because... Sensei, do you know the rumour going round school? I thought you hated Keiko. Yes, you are a troublesome student whom I should hate. But, according to rumours you felt like vomiting sometimes, didn't you? Yes, when I took wine in the evening, I felt ill the next day. I see. That's only natural. Do you like alcohol? No, I don't like it or hate it. I wanted to try my ability for many things. To tell you the truth, mama often forces me to drink. That's not good. Mama worries about me. She worries that I'll get disgusted with her life and leave her. So she wants to make me exactly like her, as quickly as possible. You caught mama's feelings and mentioned such things in school. What did I say? Well, that you are interested in men. Did I say such a thing? Yes, I said so, yes. I wanted to know the identity of my father through men. And my mama, who forgets me. I wanted to know if I can forgive my disgusting mama. That's not a healthy idea. You try to escape your mother's life, but on the contrary are unconsciously interested in it. That's not so good. You must think of something which deserves your fresh youthfulness. Sensei can't understand. Sensei. Hashimoto sensei must hate me. Why so? Is your money order gone? Did you lose it in the room? If you can't find it, what will you do? Terrible. It may seem a little severe, but we must check the belongings of all the students to find the person who stole the money order. I agree. We must thoroughly scour the lodging house. What do you think? What is your opinion? No one disagrees? How about you? I disagree. Why do you disagree? Do you disagree for no particular reason? No, sir. For the students, all of them are suspected. I don't wish to give the young people such a negative experience, who are now at the most developing age. Not experience but training. Can't you agree by thinking that? I don't think such distorted training is good. Whether willing or not, our students will be timid once they go out into the world, I want to make them as positive as possible in school at least. Positive but easily broken, that's not good. Education is just like child's play if there is no foundation for real life. I don't believe education is to adjust a person to the world as it is. Rather, to motivate them to influence the world as it should be. - I can't agree with your idealism. - Education is ideal. Ideal but not formulaic. - Formulaic means stereotype. - Me? Yes. It resulted so. You are evaluating me especially personally today. Let's leave it. Aside from your debate, what shall we do for the present issue? Listen, our rooms have been ransacked. - A thief again? - No. The teachers are inspecting our belongings. It's not fair. To Enami Kyoko-dono Medical certificate enclosed Yukiko-san, As shown in the attached certificate, Keiko's suspicion was cleared and I am fine. I report this for the gratitude of your friendship. From a revived bird, Keiko Did you find it? What is it? - Nothing. - What are you hiding? I'm not. Why are you so noisy? - I think it's wrong. - What is? Are you saying to stop the inspection? Do you think you can solve this problem? Yes! We want to solve the problem through our student's association. Are you confident? To tell you the truth, we concerned teachers discussed it. Hashimoto sensei insisted on leaving it to the student's association. I opposed her. The responsibility is all mine. You shouldn't disclose the details of our discussion. I withdrew my opinion and followed the general view. I told them where the responsibility lies. It's of no use now. I don't like to be protected by others. - I'm not protecting you. - No, whatever you are... We've found who took it! Who? Gather in the dining room. Who took it? The owner of the money order. She put it between her dictionary pages and forgot it. We found it in the dictionary. Good. I think the problem is to doubt, not to be doubted. A narrow escape. There is a saying, straighten the horns and kill the cow. But I can't trust old morals or sayings which were created in the old world. - Are you still obsessed? - You are a coward. If you blame me why didn't you blame me all the way? You are insinuating. - Am I? - Yes. Then, I'll speak out. In short, you hate old things. For instance, a female student who came from a country village was influenced by city life, began to be ashamed to introduce her old, simple and honest parents, full of wrinkles. I feel such shallowness is inherent in the way you hate old things. What can I do in order to be liked by you? But your observation is perfect. You never watch your feet, but dream of life in higher dimensions. Your body is looking for something which is standing right here, that is smaller and lower than you think. You've been very frank with me. You asked me to speak clearly, nevertheless, when I speak frankly, you seem offended. Look. The students have already recovered. How joyfully they sing. They look so cheerful. You also look cheerful and beautiful. Crooked again? You can't stand it. A sad nature. Over the mountains, far to travel People say, happiness dwells. [Uber den Bergen: Carl Busse] Well, what was it after that? Do you remember? Oh, and I went in the crowd of others, Oh, and I went in the crowd of others, and returned with a tear-stained face. Over the mountains, far to travel, people say, Happiness dwells. Over the mountains, far to travel, people say, Happiness dwells. Mazaki sensei. I thought... you were fond of me. And yet... And yet, why am I so argumentative? Why can't I be an honest woman? My mother... my deceased mother said, "someday, you will..." What's the matter? What are you doing here at this hour? Nothing. If something is bothering you, tell me. You'll feel better if you speak out about it. Come. You are just like a baby. I wanted to touch someone's warm heart. You can cry as much as you want. At your age, with your heart so full, you can't wait to reach your mother's lap to shed your tears. Manage with my lap, you can cry as much as you want. When I go home, my mama is not mine alone. I don't want to go home. Sensei, in this world, is there no happiness for a woman being alone? Sensei. Obasan, it's started snowing. Yes, so it has. Are you going back to your home town for the winter holidays. I don't know. There are many family members. I can't study at home. But you are fortunate, having such a happy family. A power failure? Oh, no. Obasan, I have a candle in the desk drawer. You have? The right side. - Did you find it? - Yes. Thank you. Maybe it's better to sleep. What a terrible wind. What is it? What's wrong at this hour? Tell me. What is it? Nothing. - What's the matter? - Obasan, look after her. She's so strange. Please. Where are you going? Mama. What are you saying? I don't know Keiko. No, I don't know Keiko. Hey, hold on. The teacher is visiting. What? Teacher? Tell me so I can understand. Maybe Keiko fell in the sea and drowned. I told her so. I told her "To hell with you!" Keiko despises me, her own mother. I told her: "go in the sea and drown yourself" As a matter of fact, right? Drop dead, Keiko. What's the matter at this hour? Will you let Enami stay tonight at your place? Did Enami do something? She quarrelled with her mother. She had no place to go, so came to me. She is staying at your place now? I don't want her to return to such a mother. Your place is no good, of course. Alright. I'll let her stay with me. I'll come for her soon. Please. I'll wait at home. Enami-kun... wake up. Wake up. Let's go. Where to? - To Hashimoto sensei. - I don't want to. But you can't stay here. No, I don't want to go. You can't stay here. What would people say? Sensei, are you afraid of people? - You are afraid of the school. - Fool. It's your problem too. Don't talk nonsense. - Let's go. - No! I don't want to go to Hashimoto sensei. What's the matter? Come with me. I hate Mazaki sensei! Enami-san. Enami-san. Sensei, where are you going to take me to? - Come to my place. - No, I'm going home. Leave me alone. No, you can't. Mazaki sensei left you in my care. Mazaki sensei still cares for me like that? How strange. I have a responsibility to take care of you. That's none of my business. Do you hate me so much? I hate you! You like Mazaki sensei, don't you? No, I hate him. I detest him. I'll go home. I'll apologize to mama. I'll tell mama, I'm sorry for despising you. I'll say I'll be a woman like mama. No, you mustn't become such a corrupt woman. Sensei, do you insult my mama? I feel sorry for mama. I know the people in the world despise mama and me. I'm going home. Enami-san. Wait. Wait! Don't go back home. Leave me alone. I'm going home. Enami-san, let's go back to Mazaki sensei. No, I'm going home. No. See this watch, wait for me for 10 minutes. I'll ask Mazaki sensei about you. Wait for me, please. Please. Stay there, alright? Is Mazaki sensei there? - Didn't you meet him? - He went out? Yes. How is it? Enami can't do without you. With my own idea I was taking her nowhere. I was wrong. Are you suggesting I marry her? Are you saying it from the heart? Or from a sudden impulse? What do you really think? You must know well. But... if I follow my real feelings it's too pitiful for her. Yes, she has become distorted by the world. Pitiful girl. Hashimoto-san, don't misunderstand me. This is a teacher's love, a teacher's duty. I'll tell you honestly. Thanks to you, I've escaped from the disaster of falling in love with her dark beauty. Thanks to you I have saved myself.
