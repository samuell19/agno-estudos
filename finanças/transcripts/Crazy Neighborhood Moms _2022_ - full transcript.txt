[slow mysterious music] [door creaks open] christian I'm in here. [door closes] you want me to come find you, so you can do whatever you want with me? -[gun cocks] -bonnie! What? I thought that-- you thought what, that I was christian? My husband, christian? Cheap. Christian hates that color. I, I think this is all just a big misunderstanding. I'm not-- you're not what, kira, sleeping with my husband? It's bad enough you've been sneaking around with him for months, but to stand here and lie to me about it? You must think I'm a complete idiot. Are you looking for this? Oh, looks like christian's running late. Lucky for me, but not so much for you. -[phone thuds] -[phone shatters] [kira gasps] [sighs] you know, he gave me those flowers too when we first got together, before he got bored and started sleeping with whores like you. Bonnie, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. This was all just a big mistake. I was gonna end it tonight. I guess you were planning on giving him quite the send off. You know what the worst part about all this is? You're not even special. This house, everything that you own, it's from your ex-husband. You don't work. You're not even that pretty. You're nothing but a basic slut. Oh, really? Well, you're nothing but a frigid bitch, and that's why chris-- -[gunshot blasts] -[kira grunts] [kira thuds] [tense suspenseful music] -[bonnie grunts] -[vase shatters] [suspenseful music] [gentle somber music] [charlotte] we're here. It's beautiful. You did good, mom. [giggles] [women breathing heavily] not bad. We can do a second run today to get the real miles in. Right, renee? Absolutely. More cardio is never a bad thing. Oh, I guess the new neighbors finally moved in. I can't believe the garcias sold that house for so little. They should've used me as their real estate agent. Oh, it looks like their girl's about my sabrina's age. She could use some more friends. She's just so shy. Yeah, you're right. Sabrina's nothing like my victoria. I also noticed that the new neighbor has no husband. Probably divorced. Maybe her husband's just, working? She's lifting all the heavy boxes. She is definitely single. The quintessential independent woman. [renee scoffs] I think we have another kira on our hands. Um, I, I, I can go talk to her, get the story if you want? No, not yet. I wanna say hello first. We're on for tomorrow after our run? Yeah, wouldn't miss it. [laughs] all right, girl. What's, what's happening tomorrow? I, I'll, I'll figure it out. Great. [angela groans] [slow somber music] welcome to the neighborhood. Hello there, I'm bonnie. Charlotte. Nice to meet you. This is for you. I just love to roll out the red carpet for new neighbors. Thank you. That is so kind. Is that your daughter? Yes, that's jordan. Oh. I have a daughter too. Victoria. She's studying abroad in paris. Wow, you must be so proud. Oh. Is your husband home as well? I'm divorced. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm not. It's for the best. Are you gonna open it? Oh, yes, of course. All of these products are from an amazing company that I represent called elavelle. That right there, that's beauty juice. It'll absolutely change your life. Angela, she lives just down the street. She got adult cystic acne, poor thing, and that cleared it right up. I am very familiar with these products. All of these products, actually. I'm a sales rep for elavelle too. You are? Well, I knew I liked you. [charlotte laughs hesitantly] I am just gonna get you some nice wine instead. Oh, no gifts are necessary, really. Trust me. You'll need it. It was lovely to meet you. I'll be seeing you around, neighbor. [tense music] how's the neighbor? Nice. I think. [deep ominous music] [gasps] charlotte's number one? [deep somber music] you've only been there a year longer than me. You're not gonna be number one for long. [deep somber music] no personal photos. All business. Interesting. Is that because your husband left you for a prettier younger thing? [deep somber music] [garage door buzzing] [cork pops] [charlotte] oh. Oh. Uh. Need some help? [charlotte] I'm okay. Christian, you want some wine? [tense music] christian. [crickets chirping] christian? -Let me get that. -[charlotte groaning] -oh. -I got it. [christian] I got it. Pretty heavy. [charlotte] you're so nice to help. [christian] just being a good neighbor. Which room's this go in? Kitchen, but, you really don't have to do this. Oh, come on. It's my pleasure. [tense suspenseful music] all right. Where do you want it? [grunts] you can just put it right over there. Okay. [box thuds] [sighs] I'm christian, by the way. Charlotte. I think I met your wife earlier. Ah, yes, my wife. Always likes to know everything that is going on in the neighborhood. So, what brings you to cascade lake, charlotte? Well, my daughter wants to get into an ivy for engineering and there's an amazing stem program here. Apparently, all the kids who get into the cascade lake's program end up having their pick of which university to attend. That's right, my daughter got into that program and now she's studying in paris. Your wife mentioned that, very impressive. Bonnie's cousin is actually on the selection committee for the stem program. Oh really? [door clicks shut] speaking of, this is my daughter, jordan. Meet christian. Hi, it's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. All right, I'm gonna let you two get back to unpacking, but if you need some help lifting the heavier stuff, I'm just a knock away. I appreciate that. Thanks again. You're welcome. Have a great night. All right, let's get these boxes. [door closes] wine? Sure. Bonnie? What the hell? Where were you? I saw the neighbor carrying a heavy box and I thought I'd give her a hand. Oh, how helpful of you. Is there something wrong with being a good neighbor? Not unless you're going back to your old ways. You do have a thing for neighbors, after all. And here I thought we moved past that. You better watch yourself. So should you. [deep tense music] this neighborhood's a little weird, don't you think? You don't like it? It's just different living in the suburbs. At least in the city, you know what to expect. I don't really know what these stepford wives are up to. That's it. No more true crime podcasts. [chuckles] I'm just looking out for us. So am I. We are in this together, babe. We're here to secure your future, remember? Lacy's driving out here tomorrow. She's having trouble sleeping, so I'm packaging together all these products, kinda like a better sleep prescription. Say, that's a cool idea. You're so good at this stuff, mom. I need to channel some of your sales energy for my stem program application. It's due this week and we both know I'm not that great at selling myself. If I don't get in, it's kinda like we moved to this town for nothing. Oh, you know what? The neighbor mentioned they're related to someone who runs the program. Why don't I see if I can get a meeting? And then you can just let me do the selling. Really? Yes. Yes, thank you. [slosomber music] [utensil clinking] some of these products are marketed to help women feel better in their body. Let's be honest, they just wanna get rid of their cellulite. [both chuckle] let me guess, these are the women who wait to have their kids in their 30s and can't seem to peel off the baby weight. [laughs] exactly. You're gonna be a natural at this. So we'll split the sales from your commission 50-50. And you can do it nights and weekends until you earn enough to replace your salary. Okay. Hm. -[computer dings] -new sales contest. The winner in each district gets, a company car? You help me get to number one and win this-- mm-hmm. And you'll be earning a six-figure commission by the end of the year, guaranteed. Anything to get me outta my soul-sucking corporate job, okay, you gotta deal. Hm. Now here's what we're going to do. We're gonna throw a big party, invite everyone we know, and we're gonna win that car. [birds chirping] [mysterious music] I love you, and you love me, and that's all that matters. [birds chirping] I'm so excited for this new sleep package. I'm really glad the supplements are helping. And coupled with the other products, you should be getting more rest in no time. I'm going to tell all my sleep-deprived ladies in my pta. You're going to get a ton of orders. Hey. Already getting a jump on the contest, I see. In the spirit of friendly competition, I wanted to invite you and jordan to my elavelle garden party tomorrow. My daughter might even fly home from paris to attend. Did you just make this, this morning? Party planning's kinda my thing. I, I just ask that you don't try to poach any of my clients at the party. Of course I wouldn't do that. And in keeping in the spirit of friendly competition, I'd like to invite you to a party I'm throwing here at the house next week for my clients. Wonderful. So, it's settled then. Oh, before you go, your husband mentioned you have a family member who's on the selection committee for the stem program. Did he? Well, he's correct. My cousin is the superintendent. Do you have any pointers on getting a meeting with him? We moved to this town just so my daughter could be in the school district and have a chance in getting into that program. My cousin's virtually impossible to get a meeting with. I mean, he doesn't really take meetings with parents directly. But, maybe I could call him, get him to move your daughter's application to the top of the pile. Thank you. I appreciate any help. [gentle music] [bonnie] we're working on a lot of new products, so really take a look. Take a look at all of the skin cream. And, the lip gloss are wonderful. Thank you so much. Oh, no, thank you. -I'm fine. -Thanks for coming. Thanks. Thanks so much. [bonnie] hi charlotte. Hey. Say hi. Hi. Whoo. You're definitely winning this contest. I've sold maybe $5,000 worth of products, and the party's just started, -so I'm feeling really good. -Good job. Now, let's double it. -Oh, I'm on it. -Lift, lift. Lift, lift. Okay. -I'll stop. -What're you doing? Angela. Uh, yes? What do you know about her? Oh, well, she's definitely divorced. Uh, I know that already. But, I don't think it was a friendly divorce if you know-- I'm so glad you could make it, charlotte. Jordan. This is a beautiful party. Is your daughter here? I wanted to introduce her. Jordan really wants to study in paris someday. It will be so nice to hear about your daughter's experience. Victoria really wanted to be here, but-- she's in paris studying, where she should be. Well, next time she's in town then. Here, I brought you this. [bonnie] oh. Very generous of you. Well, it is the thought that counts. I can take your purse so you don't have to hold it. Sweetheart, the ice needs refilling. We have caterers who can handle that. Yes, but they don't know where to find that extra freezer. Well, you can show them. I'm in the middle of hosting our guests. Mom, why don't we go over there and get some of those fancy pastries? Sure, honey. Thank you again, bonnie, for the invite. This really is a beautiful party. Don't embarrass me. Hi. [gentle music] -[tense music] -charlotte sommers. Hm. [purse contents shuffling] what're you doing? Oh, just being a good hostess. By looking through someone's personal effects? That's not what I was doing. Trust me. I don't need to rifle through charlotte's cheap purse to know that she is not interesting. [tense music] [relaxed choral music in background] fun party, huh? [chuckles] yeah. I just got out of a riveting conversation about a celery juice cleanse. [girls chuckle] you're jordan, right? I'm sabrina. You want some? Uh, no. I have a peanut allergy and all of that sweet stuff is like almond, hazelnut, whatever. [both laugh] is everyone in the neighborhood like this? Yeah, pretty much. I think my mom would probably be different if we lived somewhere else. But, my dad is away for business all the time, and so, she just gets sucked into it all. My mom's just been acting really weird since the whole robbery thing, you know? What? Oh, you haven't heard? Yeah, a couple months ago, somebody broke into a house in the neighborhood. They tried to rob the owner, and they killed her. [tense music] I was actually born in the city. And why'd you move out of atlanta? My daughter is trying to get into the stem program here, and we have to live in the school district to qualify. Oh, well it's nice that your daughter will get both environments, suburbia and city. [chuckles] how often does she visit her father? Things are a bit complicated, so she's just with me. Oh, so you get sole custody then. Mom, did you know somebody who was murdered in this neighborhood like, three months ago? -Oh. -Excuse me? Sabrina, are you trying to scare our neighbors? It's not like it's a secret, mom. What happened? [angela breathing shallowly] mom? Angela, are you all right? Hey. One second. [angela gasping] hey, mom? [bonnie] is everything okay over here? I don't think angela's feeling well. Look. Look at me. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Fine. I was just informed there was a murder in this neighborhood. Is that true? It was awful what happened. But, I promise you that cascade lakes has never seen as much as a fly get hurt before that. It was a completely random, isolated incident. What's going on? Oh, charlotte just found out about poor kira. But I told her that our neighborhood is completely safe. There's nothing to worry about. Okay. This is weird. You all look like you've just seen a ghost, and someone was killed. I don't care how safe the neighborhood normally is. Mom, why don't I build a neighborhood watch forum? Let's not make any rash decisions. Everything that deals with the neighborhood has to be voted on and approved by all the residents. Well, I think it's a smart idea. Yeah, I set one up in my old neighborhood as a project for school. I can build a custom, private online forum and we can each hook up our outdoor security camera feeds to it. As long as all the neighbors agree, anyone can see what's going on at any time. This forum online would help us watch other neighbors? Make sure there's nothing out of sorts going on? Right. I think that's a fabulous idea. [deep mysterious music] [crickets chirping] so, I'm set up as the administrator. I've emailed everyone their login to the neighborhood watch forum. I've uploaded all the feeds from your outside security cameras. You can log into the forum any time. Click around, flag any suspicious activity by pressing this button. That'll send an alert text to all the neighbors. This is all very impressive, jordan. Tell me, what else can you watch with this kind of setup? With technology you can track almost anything. That's why it's so cool. When you say track, do you mean like finding out where someone is? For example, if angela wanted to track down sabrina because she isn't where she says she is, could she do that? I'm always where I say I am. [group chuckles] I don't think you need to worry about sabrina. But with your phone, you can track people pretty easily. Most phones have geolocation, so you can find out where someone is. Thank you for setting all this up, jordan, and keeping our neighborhood safe. [group claps] what was all that about? Well you tell me. Are you too distracted by a certain neighbor? Hey, bonnie, I don't mean to be pushy, but have you had a chance to call your cousin about the stem program? Oh, I'm sorry. I have been swamped with customers. I will call him tomorrow. Now that you can see a little of what jordan can do, maybe you can put in a good word for her? Of course. Thanks bonnie. I owe you one. [bonnie chuckles] [bonnie] I brought your favorite. You didn't have to do that. I'm really glad you were able to make it out. It's been awhile. [bonnie chuckles] how's victoria doing in college? Oh, dean's list again. No surprise there. Mm-hmm. And as you know, she was selected out of thousands of students to study in paris, but she still finds time to call me every day. I think she's a little bit homesick. I'm sure she is. I'm glad to hear she's doing well at her studies. So what brings you in? I wanted to see if you were still on that selection committee for the stem program. I am. Why? Well, there's this student-- bonnie, let me stop you right there. If you're here asking for a favor for a friend, nothing you say is gonna sway my decision to accept their kid. Okay, I already called in that favor for victoria. I can't do it again. No, it's actually quite the opposite. I wanted to warn you about an applicant. What do you mean warn me? Well, there's this student, her name is jordan porter. She just moved into my neighborhood with her mother, and she has been causing some trouble. What kind of trouble? Several neighbors have reported their things missing since she moved in. And interestingly, she's the one who helped us set up our neighborhood watch. But I'm starting to realize that that was all part of her plan to know when the neighbors leave so that she could break in. And since she's the only administrator, I'm certain she's erasing the footage of her stealing things. That seems a bit complex for a teenager to mastermind. Are you sure? She is a smart one. We're all gathering the information still, and getting the police involved, but I thought it was best to let you know now. I'm sure you wouldn't wanna tarnish your program's reputation. Absolutely not. I appreciate the intel. I'll be sure to note it on her application when it comes in. What'd you say your name was again? Jordan, jordan porter. Porter. Well, thanks cuz, I appreciate it. You're welcome. Thanks for the pastries. Oh, they're delicious. Enjoy those. Yeah, you know I love 'em. [bonnie chuckles] [slow somber music] so, the party will be this Saturday night at my house. The theme will be r and r, rest and relaxation. Hey sweetie. I'm gonna teach everyone a bedtime stretching routine and meditation, and of course I'll have plenty of elavelle product samples. Everyone will leave feeling amazing. [lacy on chat] that sounds great. I'll invite the entire pta. Hey, the more the merrier. Oh, this is going to be so much fun. Yes it will. I'll see you Saturday. [chat end tone] hey sweetie. How was school? Mm, pretty good. Met some new people. You finish your stem application? I know. I know I'm procrastinating. I'm really good at the technology stuff, just not so good at the application stuff. I'll finish soon. You better. Mom, you're so good at talking to your clients. I don't know why anyone buys from mrs. Mason. I saw her at the party teaching mrs. Monroe how to sell and she was so pushy. Well, that's how the company trains you to be. I just take a different approach to things. And that's why you're number one. [chuckles] [crickets chirping] I think with that big commission check you're gonna get when you win the sales contest, you should buy this. It's a new listing in marshall hills. The owners have already moved out. It's the perfect second home. It's not far from here. It's completely private, relaxing. You could do yoga, all day. We can go look at it tomorrow. Angela, I'm trying to win a sales contest. I don't have time to drive to the middle of nowhere. Okay yeah, sure. I'll just text you the lockbox code. You can look at it whenever you want. I don't understand how charlotte is number one. She's just so [scoffs] bland. Oh, I looked at her social media and her clients really love her. Oh, maybe if you took a different approach. Her clients are just too stupid to realize that she's a fake, and a husband stealer. What? Has she been flirting with christian? Please. You saw how she looked at him at my garden party. And at the house last weekend [scoffs] I noticed all of her little attempts to get his attention. I guess I didn't notice. Yeah, it's subtle. Just like it was with kira. And just like kira, she is not gonna get away with it. [garage door clicks] oh, christian's home. Sabrina is friendly with charlotte's daughter, right? They seem to be, yeah. And charlotte is so obsessed with getting her daughter into that stem program. I think that's the only reason they moved here. So what happens to charlotte if poor little jordan doesn't get in? Uh. Oh hey, christian. I, I was just telling bonnie about this amazing property in marshall hills. It's the perfect get away. We're buying a second home now? No. [slow somber music] [bonnie sighs] [deep foreboding music] [bonnie groans lightly] [computer keys clicking] you play the part of the sweet neighbor so well, just like kira did. But I can see through you. [computer keys clicking] bingo. Devin sommers, the brain child of the hottest new tech startup, lynxtra tech, and his wife, charlotte. Huh. Startup company lynxtra tech folds after multi-million dollar lawsuit due to founder's mismanagement of money. Maybe you and I have more in common than I thought, charlotte. Husbands who hide things. [deep tense music] hey baby, I can't wait to see you tonight. You know, it's really hard pretending like we're not together. I can't just go up to you in the neighborhood and hug you or kiss you or hold your hand. But, I love you, and you love me, and that's all that matters. [deep tense music] [intriguing music] did you change your password again? [deep tense music] turns out our little charlotte's ex-husband got into some financial trouble. How do you know that? I did my research last night. Everything okay? I just um, I think you might be misreading the situation with charlotte. The last time you were researching someone-- what, angela? Go ahead. I dare you to say it. After you promised me you would never speak a word about it again. I'm sorry. I don't want there to be any more accidents. If everybody behaves themselves in this neighborhood, and you can keep it together, there's not gonna be any more accidents. [renee] hey. I'm gonna run with renee. Clearly, you are too weak to keep up. [angela shuddering] hey. [angela breathing shallowly] mom? Mom. Mom! Mom, are you okay? -Hey. What's wrong? -I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. [slow tense music] mom, you have to stop hanging out with mrs. Mason. Okay? All she does is make you upset. And ever since kira died, it's like-- sh, okay, okay. Everything okay here? It's fine. I'm just out of breath from my run. You didn't even go on a run, mom. Stop lying. [angela chuckles nervously] what are you up to this morning? [deep tense music] why are you watching her? Oh, I thought you were at work. I was on my way there, but something kept bothering me. Answer the question. Why are you watching her? I don't know what you're talking about. Charlotte, you're spying on her. And you were going through her purse the other day at the party. [bonnie] that's ridiculous. Tell me why you changed your laptop password, after we agreed in therapy to have shared passwords. I forgot to give you the new one. What happened to angela this morning? Excuse me? Something changed in your friendship right after kira was murdered. Angela is on edge, like she's always trying to hide something. Are you accusing poor angela? No, but I'm sure if she was pushed, she could tell secrets, couldn't she? You stay away from angela. Stay away from charlotte. Ah. Aren't you the hero? I mean it, bonnie. She's a neighbor, nothing more. I have no interest in her romantically or otherwise. I find that hard to believe. Look, that's enough. I am just getting started. I could go to the police right now. I'm sure they would love to hear all about your shady business deals, your offshore accounts. You would rot in prison, and you wouldn't be able to see your precious charlotte anymore, or any other woman that you just can't seem to resist. But you won't do that, will you? Miss prim and proper, queen of the neighborhood. What would everyone think of you if I went away to jail? And you turn me in? I'll tell the police you murdered kira. They would never believe you. Maybe not. But what, it will take them about 30 seconds to crack angela, who knows the truth. We have no choice but to work together here, because we both have something to hide. So how 'bout we call a truce, sweetheart. [ominous music] truce. [crickets chirping] and...Finished. [sighs] finally. [jordan sighs] [computer dings] bonnie mason. 15 hours of watch time? It's only been a week. Who are you watching, mrs. Mason? [phone line ringing] hey, jord. Hey, is mrs. Mason really nosy or something? Pretty much. Why? Uh, I can see how many hours people are checking out the neighborhood watch surveillance, and she's on it all the time. Oh, she is so obsessed with this neighborhood and controlling everybody. She once had everyone in the neighborhood sign a petition that student drivers couldn't practice there. So, I had to practice somewhere else and I crashed my mom's car. I blame her, of course. Yeah. Blaming her sounds like a good strategy. [sabrina laughs] well. [jordan chuckles] hey, neighbor. Finished unpacking? Finally. Lotta work, isn't it? Oh my goodness. [both laugh] [tense eerie music] [slow foreboding music] [christian] well, you look great. [charlotte] yeah, oh, thank you. [christian] yeah, very much. You having a good time? [christian and charlotte talking muffled] [car engine turns over] you are not gonna have that party. [haunting music] [shades snap] morning, charlotte. Hey. Hey, um, I booked massage appointments for angela me tonight. I was planning on surprising her. Something came up, and I thought maybe you would like to go instead. Maybe you could bring sabrina and jordan, make it a mother-daughter night out, my treat. Wow, that's so generous. Thank you, bonnie. I haven't had a massage in forever, and it'll be a great way to celebrate that jordan finally finished her stem application. Your daughter really is so talented. I hope she gets in the program. Thanks to you for putting in a good word with your cousin, maybe her chances are even higher. Oh, I should get back to my sales calls. Same here. Coming into the home stretch of the contest. May the best woman win. [tense suspenseful music] [siren blares distantly] [door clicks open] thank you. [slow somber music] I have an idea. Since you live too far to come to my house, why don't you throw a relaxation party for your friends at your house? I can overnight you a huge box of products. Whatever you sell, I can give you a commission. [laura on phone] next week might work. Yes? Let's do it. Okay. You can overnight it? Yeah. I can get that right out to you. -Thanks. -Thanks, laura. Bye. If I can have a client host a party, I will double my sales. Hmm. We're still in second place. It's time to step it up. I still have my day job, bonnie. I've gone into work late all week for you. I don't wanna raise any red flags. I need to win this. And I have other priorities. If you want outta that job that you whine about every day, then you need to get on the phone. Convince every woman that you know that she needs to lose 10 pounds. And that elavelle products are the magic pill. You know what? I don't think this is gonna work. 'cause I've brought in a lotta sales for you. The rest, you can handle yourself. Don't you dare leave. Renee. Renee! [door slams shut] [charlotte] oh, I can't wait for this massage. [all talking at once] [angela] have you been? Oh it's so fun, you're gonna love it. [laughs] -[car starting] -[slow haunting music] [brush rustling] [slow eerie music] [slow suspenseful music] [rattling and clinking] hm. [tense somber music] where were ya? Oh, just out for a run. Thought you were working late? You never run at night. Where'd you get that sweatshirt? Out of the back of my closet. What, is this an interrogation? I'm headed upstairs to the office. Don't work too hard. [foreboding music] that was so much fun, we gotta do it again. Bye, guys. See you tomorrow. Okay, see ya. [alarm beeping] mom, what is that? I don't know. Wait here a second while I check it out. [alarm beeping continues] dammit. Is there something going on next door? There's a gas company truck out front. How would I know? I'm going over to check. No. Christian. They checked it during the inspection, right? Of course, or we wouldn't have moved in. Just to be safe, we recommend you vacate the house for at least 48 hours. We have a ton of people coming over for a party tomorrow night. I guess I'll start calling everyone to cancel. We can go to a hotel for the night. I'll crack the windows before I leave the house. Everything okay over here? Carbon monoxide issue, something with the furnace. We have to leave the house for the night. Thank goodness that you caught it. That stuff's so dangerous. What about your party? I guess I'll need to cancel. I should call lacy and the other guests. Thanks for stopping by to check on us. [charlotte sighs] let's go. [slow tense music] [gentle somber music] [smartphone rings] charlotte, is everything okay? Yes. I wanted to let you know, the party is back on tomorrow night. What do you mean? A client of mine is going to host. It's in the city, about 20 miles away, but you're still welcome to come if you'd like. Bonnie, you there? Yes, I um, I don't think I could get to the city tomorrow. Traffic going into atlanta is just so unpredictable on the weekends, and I have a prior engagement right before. Of course. I understand. Have a great weekend and break a leg. You too. You will not win. You will not win! [food clattering] [sobbing quietly] [birds chirping] [bonnie sighs] [angela] what time are they announcing the winner? [bonnie] any minute now. I made a record number of sales this weekend, no thanks to renee, for ditching me at the last minute. I can't imagine that charlottes little backup party would be enough to put her in the lead. Oh, here it is. Oh, how about we celebrate by going to see that house in marshall hills. No. Stop trying to push that place on me. Okay. "the winner of the sales contest is..." what, did you win? What? Jordan, jordan, jordan! [yells] oh my god, mom, I'm so proud of you. That means I'm getting a new car, which means you get-- you're giving me the suv? When you get your license, you have a few months still. Does that mean I can drive to school this morning? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now I just have to get into the stem program and then we both have something to celebrate. Well, I don't think you have anything to worry about. Mrs. Mason has a relative on the committee, and she's already put in a good word. Oh! [both yell excitedly] come on in the car. Okay, okay, baby, okay. All right, let's go, let's go. Whoo! You wanna go to the spa? That always makes you feel better. Oh, angela, I don't need a massage. I need to destroy charlotte. But she won fairly. What, what more could you do? Are you really asking me that? Charlotte is a leech. She is just like kira. If I don't do something, she's gonna do exactly what kira did to me. I, I can't, I can't be involved with this. Don't be so dramatic. Bonnie, I covered for you. I lied to the police. I could go to prison if anyone found out. What about, what about sabrina? Breathe, angela breathe, hey. You know I appreciate what you did for me, right? I would never put you in that position again. Okay? Come here, come here. Come here. It's okay. [slow somber music] [birds chirping] I hear they're gonna announce who's getting into the stem program on Thursday. Really? Mm-hmm. How do you know? I overheard my chemistry teacher telling one of the kids in my class. Are you excited? More nervous. And excited, I guess. Nervcited. [both chuckle] want some? It's peanut butter frosting. [whispering] it's my mom's favorite. No thanks, peanut allergy. I forgot. You told me that. I'm sorry. No, it's all good. Anything new going on with the ever-exciting neighborhood watch? My mom's so bad at technology, I'm pretty sure she already forgot her password. [laughs] well, mrs. Mason still seems to be in some binge-watching competition with herself. Other than that, it's been quiet. I just can't imagine what she's looking for. I don't know. The only thing I can think of is her husband. Wait, she's spying on him? Your mom's not home, right? No, she's out with some of her clients. Swear you won't say anything. Uh, duh. Obviously. [both laugh] okay, well, I think there was something going on between mr. Mason and kira, the one who died. What? Oh my god, why didn't you tell before? Well, I kinda forgot about it until I saw mr. Mason acting really weird the other day. What was he doing? I couldn't sleep the other night so I was on my porch really early and I saw him out jogging, and he just stopped in front of kira's old house, and he looked really sad. Maybe he was just sad because she died and they were neighbors. No, no, because it made me remember something from about a year ago. I was walking the trail behind the neighborhood, and I saw mr. Mason and kira back there. What were they doing? Just talking, I think, but it was just weird that they were back there, alone. And as soon as they saw me, they got really tense and weird and just walked off in opposite directions. Hm. [soft mysterious music] we can watch footage of mr. Mason from the other day. There he is. Get a little closer. Hm. He definitely looks sad. Yeah. [soft mysterious music] [glass clinking] [tense foreboding music] [tense somber music] mom, this is definitely the nicest car you've ever owned. [christian] yeah? Are you sure you don't wanna keep the suv and I can keep this one? [chuckles] [charlotte] you do really well in school, and we'll see what happens. [jordan] are you serious? [christian] maybe you'll win another one. [jordan] maybe. Your mom did great. It really is a beautiful car. Well-deserved, congratulations. Charlotte, I'm so glad I caught you. Wanted to congratulate you on this wonderful prize. Thank you. I had some good competition. Hm. I've gotta head off to work. Have a great day, honey. Well, you gonna take it out for a little spin? Can't wait to drive it, but the company is sending someone to detail it today. I'll drive it to my client appointments tonight. Oh, that's so classy of them. You guys enjoy it. [laughs] [charlotte and jordan giggling] [gentle somber music] [bonnie yelling] [smartphone ringing] [sadly] hello? Bonnie. Hi, it's peter swanson from elavelle. Mr. Swanson. What an honor to have you calling me. Well first of all, call me peter, please. I like to personally reach out to my top salespeople, and I was so impressed with the numbers this month I decided to host a small dinner next week in atlanta. I'd like to invite you to join me and a few members of our executive team. I would love to. Are there any other sales reps invited? Uh, just one. Charlotte porter, the contest winner. You know, we have an opening for a district manager for the entire southeast region. The most profitable region in the company? That's the one, yes. It's got a $250,000 base salary, very attractive quarterly bonuses, and you don't have to deal with the day-to-day direct sales. Does that sound like something that would interest you? Yes. I am so honored you are considering me. Well, you and charlotte, of course. I'll have my assistant send over the details and location for the meeting and dinner. See you then. Take care. Thank you. [soft tense music] hey, I couldn't help but notice your work. Beautiful job on this car. Thanks. This is a real nice one. I would love to get an estimate for mine. Do you mind checking it out right now? I have a meeting to get to. It's that house right there. Not at all. Oh, I gotta take this. I'll meet you over there. Sure. [tense suspenseful music] [bleach dribbling] [jordan and sabrina laughing] [sabrina] thanks for walking home with me. Of course. Beats taking the bus. [smartphone alerts] oh my god, finally. It's the list of people who got into the stem program. [sabrina gasps] open it. [slow somber music] I, I didn't get in. What? That's impossible. You're like the smartest person I know. Yeah well, not smart enough, I guess. Hey, do you wanna go get some milkshakes? I heard about this new place that makes you try all of these crazy new flavors. Nothing makes you feel better than a pound of ice cream. Sure. [gentle somber music] I can't believe they didn't accept you. Bonnie even put in a good word with her cousin. He's superintendent, doesn't have enough clout to make a decision? Maybe that boarding school in new hampshire is my only option. Honey, I don't wanna think about sending you away to boarding school. Well, I don't know what else to do, unless we both move to new hampshire. I can't move there because of work. I have to stay in the southeast district, and there's nothing open in the northeast. I'm gonna make some calls starting tomorrow, find out what happened. You don't have to do that. I want to. Whoa. [laughs] what is in that? I don't even know. It was called triple deluxe or something with like, a hundred different things to make me forget about not getting into the stem program. Well, I don't think straws are gonna be able to suck this thing up, we're gonna need some spoons. Can you, yeah. [laughs] [door shutting] oh charlotte, what a surprise. I thought you'd be out driving that shiny new car of yours. I'm meeting a client in 30 minutes or so, but I wanted to tell you, jordan didn't get into the stem program. Did your cousin mention anything to you? No, that's news to me. Well, it is a highly competitive program. My daughter got in of course, but she had a stellar academic record. Your daughter also had a family member on the committee. I tried calling your cousin several times today, but his secretary wouldn't put me through. Like I told you before, it's impossible to get a meeting with him. He's the superintendent. It's his job to be available for the parents. No, he's the top executive of the school district. The people that work under him take the meetings. Besides, there's an entire committee who decides who gets into the stem program. Then I will speak to every single person on that committee if I have to. My daughter deserves this. [deep tense music] I think they gave us the wrong ones. [sabrina coughs] this ones tastes like cherry. I hate cherry. [sabrina gasps] you okay? Uh-uh. Wait that means you, you got the one with peanut butter. Let me. [sabrina gasping] just breathe. [sabrina gasping] okay. Oh. [smartphone alerts] [charlotte sighs] [deep somber music] oh my god. -[tense music] -[angela breathing heavily] jordan just told me what happened. I have to get to my daughter. Anytime she gets a shot, she has to go to the hospital afterwards, and my car's still at the mechanics. I knew I should've gotten a rental car. And bonnie just left, so she can't pick me up, and I'm trying to get an uber but it's saying no drivers are available right now. Just take my new car. What? The client I'm seeing tonight ordered a lot more product than I expected, so I'm taking the suv. -Okay. -Here. Take my new car. Okay, thank you so much. Come on, come on. Okay. [slow somber music] [car chiming] what? What is going on? -What the hell? -[car chiming] [engine stalling] come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come, come on. [engine stalling] [horn honks] [angela gasps] [horn honks] -[angela screams] -[vehicles crash] [bird cawing] today I'm standing in front of you, angela's loving family and dearest friends with deep sadness in my heart. Angela showed us that no matter how hard life can be, we must stay loyal, love fiercely, and live every moment because we never know how or when it will end. Angela was more than a best friend to me. She was like the sister I never had. Her spirit will always guide every decision that I make for the rest of my life. I'm forever grateful for every moment that we spent together. [tense music] hey sabrina. Hey, hey, I'm here for you. I just can't listen to those lies anymore. Mrs. Mason? Yeah, she's so full of it. Did you know that when we first moved to this neighborhood, she hated my mom, she hated her. She made it hell for her until she needed something from my dad, and then suddenly she's mom's best friend. I didn't know that. I'm so sorry. At least I won't have to put up with her for much longer. What do you mean? I have to move to germany with my dad. What? I know, it sucks, but he can't leave work, and I can't wait to be outta this neighborhood. But I don't wanna leave school and I don't wanna leave you. [sniffling] maybe I can come visit you out there. Yeah. I'd love that. [gentle somber music] well, I'll keep watch and I'll jump in if mrs. Mason even tries to come near you. [sighs] I'm not kidding though, jordan. There's something very wrong with ms. Mason. I know we joke about her a lot, but I have a bad feeling there's things we just don't know about. She's not just some harmless neighborhood mom. She's crazy. [foreboding music] [crickets chirping] it was a nice service for sabrina's mom today. When does she leave for germany? This weekend. I'm really gonna miss her. I know you will, sweetie. I looked into that boarding school in new hampshire again. Honey. I don't wanna leave you mom, but it's only a few hours flight from the atlanta airport, and it's not that expensive. I can come home every weekend. Sweetie, no. I haven't given up on the program here yet. They already rejected me. With no good reason. You have perfect grades, stellar references from your other school technology programs, and you've built the most sophisticated neighborhood watch I've ever seen. There has to be a reason they didn't accept you. And we're gonna find out what their reason is. Okay? Okay. I won't give up. Not yet. [jordan sighs] that for the elavelle dinner tomorrow night? Mm-hmm. I could come with you if that'd make you feel better after everything that's happened with angela. We could even make a night of it. Get a suite at a hotel in the city, like old times. Hm, like old times, huh? I think we're way past that. We have our truce. I don't tell your secrets and you don't share mine. No need to complicate things. [deep foreboding music] I'm gonna feel a lot better very soon. [tense mysterious music] hm. [tense mysterious music] [birds chirping] [zipper scratches] I'm leaving a little bit earlier for my dinner tonight. I have a meeting with a new client. I'll be gone before you get home from school, so I'll see you later tonight, okay? Okay. Good luck, I know they'll love you. Thank you, sweetie. [soft mysterious music] no reception. Well that's good. Angela was right about the privacy. And there's the code. [tense music] [charlotte sighs] here we go. [tense somber music] [suspenseful music] -[cars honking] -oh, I can't believe this. Come on, I'm gonna be late. [tense music] [charlotte sighs] [jordan sighs] hello? Anyone here? Can I help you, young lady? Superintendent campbell? Yeah, that's me. How'd you get in here? The door was unlocked. Well, my secretary must've forgotten to lock it for the day. What can I help you with? I'm jordan porter. My mom was trying to reach you. Porter, huh? Yeah, I got your mother's messages. If you're here to try to change my mind about the stem program, you're wasting your time. I was just wondering why I wasn't chosen. Well, it's a committee selection, miss porter. I wouldn't know everyone's personal reasons for not selecting you. Okay. Uh, well, did you vote for me? If you must know, I rejected your application. Why? Miss porter your acceptance or nonacceptance into this program is not up for discussion. Well there has to be a reason. I have perfect grades and references and better test scores than two of the other applicants that got in. I know, but it's not just about test scores. I know you're related to my neighbor, mrs. Mason, and she said she'd put in a good word for me. Did that put you off or something? A good word? Miss porter, I'm afraid you're a bit confused about how others perceive you. Okay? Now if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting. I expect this conversation ends here. Good day. -Thank you. -Mm-hmm. [deep tense music] dammit, charlotte, I can't be late for this dinner. Now there's not gonna be enough time. [groans] [tense music] seriously? [sighs] no reception, great. At least my gps still works. [soft mysterious music] hi, this is charlotte porter. Sorry I can't take your call, please leave a message. Hey, mom, I just had a super-weird conversation with the superintendent. Call me when you get this. [suspenseful music] [charlotte sighs] okay. [charlotte sighs] [suspenseful music] rebecca? Rebecca, it's charlotte. [ominous music] rebecca? Rebecca? Rebecca? [charlotte cries out] let me outta here! [banging at door] what? What is happening? Please, just come open the door. Somebody, please! Help! Help me. Please, please, help. Rickets chirping] [phone ringing] hey, jordan. Hey. I'm sorry to bother you. I know you're packing for germany and have a million things to deal with, but I think mrs. Mason is the one who messed up my chances of getting into the stem program. Are you serious? Yeah, so, her cousin is the superintendent. I asked him why I didn't get in, and he said some cryptic thing about how I don't know how others perceive me. Maybe she told him I did something bad, but, why? I don't know. Maybe she's mad at your mom for winning the sales contest. That's a weird way to get revenge. She's a weird lady. [jordan sighs] hold on. You said before that you thought mr. Mason was having an affair with that neighbor, the one who died. Yeah, kira. And now mrs. Mason watches everyone in the neighborhood all the time. That doesn't surprise me. She's a big snoop. Oh my god. Get this. Most days, mrs. Mason watches for two to three hours. But on the 17th she watched for six hours. That's the day my mom died. I know. Hey, let me go through the rest of this neighborhood watch footage and I'll call you back. I have a weird feeling about all of this. Are you gonna be okay? Yeah. I'm just gonna finish packing. Um, I'll talk to you later. Love you. Love you. [jordan sighs] [computer keys clicking] hm. Where are you going? [tense foreboding music] and why did you come to my house? [tense foreboding music] what are you doing? [tense foreboding music] [phone keys clicking] [phone line ringing] uh, come on, mom. Pick up, pick up, pick up. [jordan groans] [dramatic music] if I could just pry that door open. [soft mysterious music] okay. Okay. Okay. [tense suspenseful music] [charlotte grunts softly] [light jazz music] [patrons chattering] oh, oh bonnie, I'm just as impressed with your wit as I am with your sales numbers. And, since it seems charlotte's a no-show, you are the leading candidate for this position. I am so flattered and honored. Shall we order some wine for the table? Tell you what, you can do the honors and choose. How about the chateau du cray? Oh, I've actually always wanted to try that. It's a great bordeaux. Hm. A lady that knows her wine, very impressive. [suspenseful music] [woman on phone] I'm sorry miss, we checked with the party and she hasn't arrived yet. Are you sure? Yes. There's only one woman who is a guest of the party, and her name isn't charlotte. As soon as she arrives, can you please tell her to call her daughter? I will, miss. Thanks. [sighs] [soft mysterious music] maybe I'm overreacting. [soft mysterious music] there's one way to find out, mr. Mason. Hey. Jordan. Everything okay? Not really, no. It's about my mom. What about her? Is mrs. Mason like, mad at my mom or something? Oh no, I don't believe so. Why? Are you sure? Because I'm pretty sure she said something to her cousin that ruined my chances of getting into the stem program. And she watches people in the neighborhood, a lot. Okay, what do you mean? On the neighborhood watch forum, she's on it all the time. Did you know that? No. But I work a lot, I'm not home that much. [sighs] were you home the day that sabrina's mom died while driving my mom's car? No. Why? Because she was on it watching for six hours that day. And she even came to my house, and she was hanging around my mom's new car. What does that mean? What exactly was she doing? I don't know. Do you think there's any possibility that your wife would wanna hurt my mom? Mr. Mason, please. If you know anything, my mom's supposed to be at that company dinner right now and she never showed up. You know something, and I can tell. [jordan sighs] yeah. You're just gonna leave? Yes. But you're coming with me. We're gonna find her. [charlotte yelling and grunting] -[charlotte grunting] -[wood thudding] who are you, rebecca, and why did you lock me in here? [charlotte breathing heavily] -let me out! -[shed rattles] [foreboding music] other than the restaurant, your mom didn't mention going anywhere else, right? She was going to see a new client today, before the company dinner. Do you know where? No. She didn't say. Hold on. I think I can track her phone. How? I can use "find a phone". I thought you could only do that with your own device. I'm pretty sure I linked our phones a while back. Yep, I did. Okay, uh, the closest town is called marshall hills. Marshall hills? Wasn't angela showing a property? Huh? Go to the real estate website and pull up the listings for angela samuels. I think I know where your mother is. [tense mysterious music] hs] bonnie, we are all very impressed with you. I'd like to officially offer you the job. Yes, I accept. I'm so excited and honored for this opportunity. I hope I'm not speaking out of turn, but I do think that you made the right choice between me and charlotte. Well, given charlotte didn't show up tonight, it's clear she wasn't interested in the position. I don't think that's the reason. Oh? Charlotte has some skeletons in her closet. She has the reputation in our district for being ruthless. Well, that's not necessarily a bad thing. We actually appreciate tenacity. Of course. But charlotte has a certain inclination for using practices that are not acceptable or legal. She must've learned a thing or two from her ex-husband. He got into some financial trouble at his own business. And I just learned that charlotte was well aware of it. She even had a hand in it. I had no idea. We can't have someone like that on our team, and certainly not in a management role. [ominous music] [deep somber music] that's my mom's car. [deep somber music] mom? Mom? Jordan? Jordan, is that you, baby? I'm in here. [jordan] mom? -[banging on shed] -jordan, I'm here. Jordan? Jordan! Hang on charlotte. [charlotte] okay. Mom! We need to break the lock. Okay, just wait, mom, okay? [charlotte] okay. Okay. [christian grunts] get back, charlotte! [christian yells] [lock clatters] oh, oh, jordan. [jordan] thank god you're okay. I'm all right, baby. [charlotte breathing heavily] how did you find me? And why are you two together? I tracked your phone, but it only went so far. And mr. Mason knew the rest. How? I think my wife had something to do with this. You're saying bonnie locked me in here? I mean, maybe she pretended to be a client to get you out here. Just to stop me from going to the company dinner? Or did she want to-- mom, I think mrs. Mason did something to your new car. She thought you were gonna drive it that night, not mrs. Samuels. We don't have any proof. Well, it's about damn time we get some. [deep somber music] how 'bout we do lunch next week? Oh, I'd love that. We can brief you more on the upcoming conferences and your travel schedule. Perfect. [glass clinking] everyone, let's have one last toast congratulating bonnie on her new position. Managing the most important district, the southeast. [glasses clinking] so exciting. [christian] I'm looking for someone. Wow. [deep foreboding music] bonnie. What are you doing here? I just rescued charlotte from a shed. The one you locked her in, and planned to kill her. Are you insane? I would never do something like that. You know what I think? I think you two are having an affair, and you came down here to sabotage me. Looks like she roped her daughter into this too. That's what you think, but here's what I know. You murdered our neighbor, kira, 'cause I was having an affair with her. And you only got away with it 'cause you have information about my business that could put me away for a long time. What do you think you're doing? You tampered with charlotte's car, hoping she'd get into an accident, but you killed your best friend instead. And I have every reason to believe you were headed back to that house tonight to murder charlotte too. Peter, he's lying. It's over, bonnie. You idiot. Do you realize you are gonna rot in prison now? Yes. But it's a small price to pay to stop you from hurting anyone else. [tense music] -[bonnie yells] -[knife slashing] -[jordan screams] -[crowd gasps] oh no you don't. [jordan] mom, no! [christian groans] [charlotte and bonnie grunting and yelling] [knife clinking] you are not gonna get away with this, you bitch! [charlotte cries out] [adventurous music] [silverware clattering] [both yelling] back! [chef] whoa, whoa, whoa. You did it! Jordan, go! [bonnie yells] go. [charlotte and bonnie yelling] please. I can't wait to watch you die. -[cup clunks] -[bonnie grunts] -[charlotte whimpering] -[body thudding] [deep somber music] [siren blaring] [jordan] mom. I'm okay, I'm okay. Everything's gonna be okay. [slow somber music] [sabrina] thanks, you can come see me. You can even stay with me. -What if I literally-- -[both laugh] maybe they'll let me [muffled by sabrina laughing]. Okay. [laughs] I don't think so. They're very strict there. -I bet. -You know what happened-- right, exactly. We don't want any [both laughing]-- hey, girls. Sabrina, we didn't think we'd see you 'til next month. I know, I'm so thankful my dad decided to come back early. Hi. It's so good to see you. We're both so happy to see you. [all giggle] for jordan getting accepted into both universities she applied to. Jord, why didn't you tell me? I'm still processing. That's so exciting. Oh, congrats. It's all because I got into that stem program. [charlotte] yeah. In both my interviews, they said that was the most impressive part of my application. [all chuckle] what university do you think I should go to? Whatever one you want, honey. Luckily with this new district manager job, I have more flexibility to travel, so I can come see you anytime. [all giggle] [sabrina] I'm so proud of you, jordan. You did azing. [girls laugh]
