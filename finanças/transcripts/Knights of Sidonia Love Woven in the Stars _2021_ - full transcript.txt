Release Clasp Formation! Found you! Take this! You penetrated the core! Gauna disintegrated! "Predicted Core Location" Eight down. Nine. Ten. You're not out here just to rack up kills, Hamagata! --Hashine! --I'm fine. I can dodge it. You guys in the front shouldn't try to do it all by yourselves. We're behind you. Remember that. Right! Thank you, Tanikaze-san. "Virtual Garde Training System" "Virtual Garde Training System" "Virtual Training Complete" "Virtual Garde Training System" "Virtual Training Complete" You destroyed the Gauna Pod. You destroyed the Gauna Pod. "Training Rank #1 Kairi Hamagata" You destroyed the Gauna Pod. "Training Rank #1 Kairi Hamagata" "Training Rank #1 Kairi Hamagata" The mission is a success. "Training Rank #1 Kairi Hamagata" "Training Rank #1 Kairi Hamagata" Okay, everybody out! Okay, everybody out! Your mission completion time was 29 minutes. A new record! Instructor Tsuruuchi! With the results I got today, I could take down a Gauna twice that size! Hamagata, you're a good pilot, so you need to fix that cockiness of yours. Tanikaze-san! Good work, Tanikaze-san! Tsumugi! I thought you might be hungry, so I made you this. Thank you, Tsumugi! It's so good! "Knights of Sidonia: Love Woven in the Stars" Sidonia has now spent ten years in the Planet Nine region. I'm sure some of you wish this peace would continue forever. But I want you to remember the reason why we came. To colonize Planet Seven. That is our great task as humanity's Seed Ship. Our common dream. "To Seven, the Land of Safety and Peace" That is our great task as humanity's Seed Ship. Our common dream. That is our great task as humanity's Seed Ship. Our common dream. But the Large Gauna Cluster is blocking our path. We've spent a decade planning a way to destroy it. And now, we're ready. The time is now! Sidonia will now begin its war against the Large Gauna Cluster! Given the distance to the Large Gauna Cluster, we believe it will take a year for the war to end. Our plan is already in place! Now is the time to win the war against the Gauna, and realize humanity's great dream! I expect all of you to go above and beyond in fulfilling your duty. Want to go over there? Hey there. Tsumugi, are you ready? Hooray! Tsumugi came up with the idea and made it herself. It's perfect. Really? I'm so happy! It's beautiful! Did you use to have festivals like this every year? That's right. But then the war with the Gauna began, and we had bigger problems. We haven't had one since the year we met Nagate. Yeah. I think it was really nice of the captain to let us bring back the Gravity Festival. Look at this, Tanikaze-san! This is me! It's cute! Hello there, Tanikaze-kun. H-Hoshijiro? Hey, Tanikaze. En? Ren? And-- Let me introduce you to our new sisters. They're so tiny. And young! They were rolled out a year early this time, but the progress we've made with compressed education means they make fine pilots. Hello, everyone. I'm Ryo Honoka. I'll introduce you. From the right, Nen Honoka, Raku, Kan, Shoku, Sui, Kei, Baku, Sen, Kun, To. And... Nen, Raku, Kan, Shoku... It's no good. I can't remember them all. Well, give it time. It's Tsumugi-chan! Tsumugi-chan, Clasp with me! Okay! It's Tsumugi-chan! Izana-san, look! "513th Final Round" "513th Final Round" Oh, it's the Gravity Cup. "513th Final Round" "513th Final Round" Tsuruuchi-san made it all the way to the finals! Tsuruuchi-san made it all the way to the finals! Wow, Tsuruuchi-san! This year's your chance to win, Tsuruuchi. He always loses at the last minute. Don't say that! I'm not who I used to be! Right, Samari? If I win, this time you have to photosynthesize with me... What? Down! Photosynthesis... That's game! The winner is Toutarou Yamano, the new kid! Tsuruuchi is denied the victory by a young entrant once more! "513th Gravity Cup Toutarou Yamano" "513th Gravity Cup Toutarou Yamano" Huh? "513th Gravity Cup Toutarou Yamano" The new kids seem to be having fun. Right? Hey! You're such a kid... That hurt! Tsumugi? We will now begin "Planet Ten" "Planet Ten" the operations phase of our plan to destroy the Large Gauna Cluster! "Planet Four" the operations phase of our plan to destroy the Large Gauna Cluster! "Planet Six" the operations phase of our plan to destroy the Large Gauna Cluster! The operations phase of our plan to destroy the Large Gauna Cluster! Sidonia entered the region around Planet Nine, remaining in a position on the exact opposite side of the star Lem from the Large Gauna Cluster. We've been in a stalemate. They can't easily reach us, but we can't reach them. But Toha Heavy Industries has developed a weapon that will change that forever! Director Sasaki! The Graviton Radiation Emitter. The Graviton Radiation... what? The one capable of piercing even superstructures? I thought its existence was entirely theoretical. We built it using the data left behind by the scientist Ochiai. The scientist... Ochiai? But... we managed to get the thing built, though there are still problems. Particularly the energy it consumes. So to fire one shot, you need... lemme count the zeroes on that number... You're kidding! This is the limit of our current technology. But where are we supposed to get this much energy? We use the energy of the star Lem. We'll place the Stellar Energy Collectors near Lem. It will take about a year to fill them. Wow... We can shoot it as many times as we want! Is there a risk the Gauna will find it? The system uses no Heigus particles. That's right. Gauna respond to Heigus particles and Kabi. So it's invisible to them? But due to its simple construction, all it can do is gather energy. "Planet Five" But due to its simple construction, all it can do is gather energy. But due to its simple construction, all it can do is gather energy. "Collector Sphere 2" "Collector Sphere 2" We'll need a separate system to actually send the energy to the emitters. "Collector Sphere 2" "Collector Sphere 1" We'll need a separate system to actually send the energy to the emitters. "Collector Sphere 1" We'll need a separate system to actually send the energy to the emitters. "Collector Sphere 1" For that, we'll deploy a network of transmitters and relays. Oh, so they're going to find it anyway. Thus, we deploy the transmitters only after the energy has been sufficiently charged. We do it right before we fire, and in an extremely short time span. That's why we're making a new Garde Unit, the Series 20 Yukimori, with a new type of engine. This unit can carry the transmitters to Lem extremely quickly. Tanikaze, you'll be our pilot for the Yukimori. Yes, ma'am. First, we'll take Planet Eight in order to establish the transmitter. Planet Eight is hidden from the Large Gauna Cluster by Lem right now. "Large Gauna Cluster" Planet Eight is hidden from the Large Gauna Cluster by Lem right now. "Large Gauna Cluster" "Large Gauna Cluster" This is our chance. "Large Gauna Cluster" "Large Gauna Cluster" We have another trick up our sleeve that's almost done. We have another trick up our sleeve that's almost done. Kunato? What do you mean? Hybrid 2. Did you know that Kunato was creating a second Hybrid? The captain told me just before the briefing. I guess this means a new sibling for Tsumugi. Yeah. That's right. Kanata's brain waves are normal. Ena mass is stable. It took a long time to complete it. Of course. We were trying to make an immortal, perfect life form. You! Hurry! And don't smack into anything! "Men's Changing Room" I will never get used to this. All control systems and sensors normal. Propulsion operating normally. Garde Units are being loaded into the hangar. All Gardes, as well as Hybrid Tsumugi, please hurry with your work. Left and right loading devices functioning normally. Garde Unit techs, do your final checks on the Series 19s and Upgraded Series 18. Operating as normal. Launch preparations complete! High Commander Kobayashi, the Mizuki is taking off. Understood. Make sure this attack is a success, XO Midorikawa. Roger that. Tactical defense cruiser Mizuki, taking off! The area around Planet Eight! Roger. Releasing output on Heigus propulsion engine. Initiating special acceleration! Attention all personnel. The goal of this operation is take over Planet Eight, our optimal relay point, and place the relay units. Gardes, your task will be to destroy all the Gauna on Eight. Roger! Bridge to hangar control, you are cleared to launch your Gardes. --Opening left and right launch ports. No obstacles on the launch path. --Garde launcher, begin launching all Gardes! --Opening left and right launch ports. No obstacles on the launch path. --Garde launcher, begin launching all Gardes! --One-zero until the Heigus propulsion engines reach their launch values. --One-zero until the Heigus propulsion engines reach their launch values. Fire! Release all bulkheads on the Hybrid launch port. Hybrid Tsumugi's pulse and brain waves are stabilized. Tsumugi, you protect this ship. Roger. Mizuki to all personnel. We will now begin the assault on the enemy-controlled Planet Eight. This is Tanikaze. Roger! Observation team, begin identifying the location of the primary core immediately. "Switching Visual Perception Area" Observation team, begin identifying the location of the primary core immediately. Observation team, begin identifying the location of the primary core immediately. Gauna Pod Ga-708! Approximately 1,000 kilometers until the encounter begins! Ga-708 has launched multiple Gauna. Eww... It's not like what we saw in training! I can do this! I can do this! I can do this! Calm down! Focus! You beat him a bunch of times in training! There are fewer than in training! We can do this! All units, Release Clasp Formation! Roger! Open fire! Yes! Almost all the Gauna that were launched have been destroyed. No sign of a second wave! This is the observation team! We've identified the location of the Gauna Pod's primary core! Okay, everyone on the forward team, get close and strip off its Ena! Roger! Core is 70% broken through! Primary core exposed! Everyone, fire your core-piercing rounds! Ga-708 has disintegrated! The Gauna Pod was destroyed! The Gauna were just easy targets! I won! Wait! There's still a Gauna signal! One... Two... No, four! There's more? Let's hit them! Roger! Just a little more... All personnel, stay on alert! Where'd it come from? What? What happened? Forward units, fall back! One unit down. What is this? What is this voice? Sister? A transmission from the Gauna? "Analyzing" "Analyzing" This is... "Analyzing" "Eiko Yamano" This is... This is... What is this? Release Clasp Formation. Begin attack on all Gardes. Unit 843 badly damaged! Pilot seat shell is lightly damaged. The pilot is alive! Core exposed. The pilot has died... Nishinaka-kun... Core destroyed. One unit down. They're attacking us with our own combat doctrine! The Gauna didn't fight like this in virtual training! Release Heigus particles! They dispersed it! They even copied the Garde's anti-Heigus coating... Get off me, damn it! Hashine! Tanikaze has taken one down! Tanikaze-san! That's a Gauna! Don't be deceived by its appearance! Fight like you always do! It's an old type, not even autonomous... He's amazing! Damn it! I can't hit it! Ryo, keep firing! Bring it here! Sister! Tanikaze-san! Okay, just two left! Don't eat me! Nakama is badly damaged! Communication lost! The Intelligent-Type Gauna have captured Nakama's unit --No! --and are leaving the battlefield! --Tsumugi, stop! --and are leaving the battlefield! Tanikaze-san... They ate a person! We learned in class that there are Gauna that copy the form of the pilots they eat. We took so much damage from just four Gauna... The Series 19s and Upgraded Series 18s didn't stand a chance against them... It was like it could tell what their autonomous mode would do. We haven't seen an Intelligent-Type Gauna since the Crimson Hawk Moth. But... now it can Clasp? It may actually be specialized for hunting Gardes... What is this? "Planet Seven Lem Planet Eight Planet Nine" "Unconfirmed" "Unconfirmed" "Planet Seven Large Gauna Cluster Lem" The Large Gauna Cluster has moved. And it's faster than estimated! It may have generated new propulsion units with its Ena. How much time do we have? Six months at this rate. It will intercept Sidonia in orbit around Planet Eight. If we leave Nine now, we can dodge it. Captain! If they want a final battle, they can have it. The Sidonia remains in orbit around Planet Nine. We will begin the Sector 32 Dismantling Experiment as planned. Maintain gravity balance in your tower! That was dangerous, Hamagata! Oops! Hamagata-kun, I know we're not in combat, but that doesn't give you an excuse to play around. Sorry. Huh? Tsumugi, what's wrong? You always get excited during these things. I'm not always going to be a kid, okay? Is this going to make it in time? The Large Gauna Cluster started moving and moved up the schedule six months, right? We haven't even finished the Series 20. So we have to fight before the collectors finish charging? We paid a high price to be able to build them. It has to work... I'm sure it will be fine, everyone! Stellar Energy Collector Spheres 1 through 3 have successfully been placed in orbit around Lem. The others will be arriving shortly. Okay. Our next top story. Command announced today that they successfully took Planet Eight. "Planet Eight Taken" Command announced today that they successfully took Planet Eight. "Planet Eight Taken" "Planet Eight Taken" Planet Eight is a strategically important planet in Planet Eight is a strategically important planet in --So will we not have to be --our war against the Large Gauna Cluster. --Scared of the Gauna anymore? --our war against the Large Gauna Cluster. --But... can we really beat the --our war against the Large Gauna Cluster. --Large Gauna Cluster head on? --our war against the Large Gauna Cluster. --I'm scared... --our war against the Large Gauna Cluster. This assault was the first step. Everything is proceeding as planned... The move-up of the time line is scaring the people on board the ship. We can fire the Graviton Radiation Emitter even without fully filling the collectors. Have Toha finish the Series 20 as fast as possible. Of course. Captain, we need to talk. Mizuki to Sidonia Central Command. The relay base around Planet Eight has been set up, and we are returning to base. Permission granted. Whew, we're finally done! Time for some nice relaxing photosynthesis! Kunato? Tanikaze, it's not good to get too sentimental. Human emotions are useless in the battle against the Gauna. The Gauna won't wait for us to stop crying. Nagate? Hiyama-san? What are you doing here? Well, you know... I know Kunato's right, but... You remind me of people I knew who were much like you... One of them was someone who fought a long time to protect Sidonia. The other saved me when I almost died. They both had different ways of thinking, but they both cared deeply for Sidonia. It's been almost two months since we took over Eight, but the Large Gauna Cluster hasn't changed its course. If we'd changed course immediately, we could've escaped. But not now. And our new weapon, the Series 20, isn't finished. Captain! We will attempt to boot up the Hybrid, Kanata. Kanata? This soon? We will have her generate a propulsion device like the one in the Series 20. Are you ready, Kunato? We're ready, Captain. Kunato-kun, what are you doing? It's dangerous to be up there! If something happens... I'm here just in case something happens. It's fine. Go ahead. We will now initiate a boot-up test for the Hybrid, Kanata. "Hybrid Kanata Test Activation” We will now initiate a boot-up test for the Hybrid, Kanata. "Hybrid Kanata Test Activation” Hybrid Kanata is in boot-up sequence 1. Vitals are stable. Brain waves normal. No issues. Ena mass has reached expected values. Remote control routes established for all nerve circuitry from the center to the edges. Move to boot-up sequence 2. Roger. Releasing safeties! Kunato-kun! Disabling hibernation. Kanata is awakening. Brain waves stable. Hybrid Kanata boot-up successful. Is Kunato-kun okay? He seems to simply be unconscious. It's been a century since then? Would you be willing to forgive me at last, Kobayashi? This voice... I have my immortal body! I've finally been freed from the very concept of a species! Ochiai, you bastard... You almost destroyed Sidonia! Why are you here? A century ago... Is that the scientist Ochiai? Ochiai? The one who started the 4th Gauna War? --Him? --The one who threw away the Kabizashi and let the Gauna in? --The one who threw away the Kabizashi and let the Gauna in? Kanata's Ena mass is expanding beyond predicted values! "Heigus Particle Signal" Kanata's Ena mass is expanding beyond predicted values! "Heigus Particle Signal" "Heigus Particle Signal" Heigus particle density is rising rapidly! "Heigus Particle Signal" It's absorbing unexpected amounts from the ship's Heigus ducts! We're destroying Kanata. Gardes on duty, equip Hyper Velocity Projectile Accelerator Devices and head there immediately! Roger! Tanikaze, Samari, get both your teams ready to go! This is impossible... I need to stop him! Command, Kanata is using its Ena to create a Graviton Radiation Emitter! Did you say Graviton Radiation Emitter? What happened? Primary and backup controls for the experiment lab sector are down! What is this? Gravity vibration waves detected! A gravity warning is in effect! A gravity warning is in effect! --Gravitational anomalies occurring across the ship! --What is this? --Gravitational anomalies occuring across the ship! Begin safety procedures immediately! A gravity warning is in effect! A gravity warning is in effect! Gravitational anomalies-- --Begin safety procedures immediately! --Tanikaze! --Begin safety procedures immediately! We have a wounded pilot! Requesting assistance! Fire in Garde Hangar 7! Firefighting teams, head there now! Explosions have occurred in multiple Garde Hangars! Upgraded Tsugumori Il damaged! The internals around the pilot seat are badly damaged! It cannot launch, and its pilot is badly injured! What's going on here? "Unconscious" Tanikaze-san! An explosion? Command, what the hell is going on? What's happening? Izana-san, is Tanikaze-san okay? I don't know either! No! This is Tsumugi! Open the door to my launch port! Hurry! We can't get it open here! We're investigating why! Give us some time! I can't! I'm destroying this door! Tsumugi, calm down! Hybrid Tsumugi's launch port won't open! Someone has sealed it! We had bombs planted here too! The Series 20 was damaged! Ochiai, you bastard... Have every crew member, including civilians, search the ship from top to bottom! "Communications Lost" search the ship from top to bottom! "Communications Lost" "Communications Lost" It doesn't matter what you do, Kobayashi. "Communications Lost" Captain, Kanata has forced his way into the ship's communications system and is leaking information. I've been reborn into the ultimate life form! Ochiai! Hey! There's wounded over there! Shit! Hey, you! What are you doing? Target sighted! Opening fire! Fire! It didn't work! That's... a Superstructure? 783 badly damaged! Pilot unconscious! A mass cannon... That shell was so fast! Displaying analysis! No... normal Garde weapons can't destroy it! I told you, it's useless, Kobayashi. We'll use the Graviton Radiation Emitter too. Captain, with the amount of Heigus particles we have aboard the Sidonia, we need to get real close or it won't work! If we don't use it now, we'll lose the ability to use it forever. Get it ready. She wants us to fire the Graviton Radiation Emitter? How are we supposed to get the energy? Captain's orders! We have to fire it, even at minimum power! How are we even supposed to hit it from there? What do we do? The emitter is the only weapon that can penetrate Hybrid 2's Superstructure, but we can't use it. But he has a Graviton Radiation Emitter of his own, made from Ena... Communications restored! "Hybrid Kanata" Communications restored! "Hybrid Kanata" "Hybrid Kanata" Commander, Kanata's firing device will be ready in a few minutes! Commander, Kanata's firing device will be ready in a few minutes! So you're making the exact same mistake you made last time, Ochiai? I'm not what I was before. And now there's no Hiroki Saito. He left behind an heir. You mean Nagate Tanikaze? I never thought I'd hear those words from you. She's crazy, you know that? Time to show us your skills, then! Tsumugi! Even assuming you somehow beat the Gauna, how long do you think you can keep your species alive by passing the seed down the generations? A few hundred million years at best? No, a few thousand? I'm different. Now, I can even talk to the Gauna. Understanding the Gauna is impossible. Don't you want to know what they want? Where they came from? What they're trying to do? Tanikaze-san! Seventy seconds. If you insist on trying to eliminate the Gauna... ...I'll show you no mercy. I'll destroy the Sidonia. Kobayashi, I can keep humanity alive all by myself-- That's impossible, Ochiai. You're going to die here. But there's no need to fear. As you leave this world, know you can believe in the next generation! You leave me no choice then. Kanata's Graviton Radiation Emitter will be online soon! Thirty seconds until it fires! The ducts are connected! Do we have the barrel ready yet? We need three minutes! That's not enough time! Let me help! Tsumugi, don't tell me you're going to serve as a support pillar? The tip isn't shielded! It's not safe! Five seconds until Kanata fires! Tsumugi! Tanikaze-san, I'll protect Sidonia... Stop, Ochiai! Lalah? Why were they able to fire? And through the hull? Old man! Tsumugi! Tsumugi! The disintegration stopped! There's still Ena left! Why? We destroyed the core! Look. There's still core left! There was another he was hiding! I told you, Kobayashi. If something's really important, you need a spare! Kanata is heading away from the Sidonia at high speed! Wow, it blasted a hole clean through here! It's the only weapon capable of penetrating a Superstructure. Even with the bare minimum of power we were able to scrape up from the Sidonia, it hit this hard. But our enemy, the Hybrid Kanata, has this same weapon. Tsumugi saved us again, huh? Yes. The civilian crew have sent a lot of thank you messages. Get well soon, Tsumugi. It's not just her. It's you too. You saved us all again. Everyone's grateful. Oh, how's Nagate? Still in the ICU. He's not in any danger, but it'll take two to three weeks to get him back on his feet. Why do the exams take so long for a tiny injury like this? --Yamano-san! --Yamano-senpai! You caught the one who attacked Tanikaze-san, right? Wow! Not entirely, no. Do you know what happened to her? Her body is still alive. It was sent to Shinatose Labs. They found some kind of bug in her body... Bug? I got you! So they're thinking that other crew members may be being controlled by the scientist Ochiai. We just got examined ourselves. Scary, huh? Both that woman and Norio Kunato were taken over by Ochiai without even knowing it! Norio Kunato? Yes. From Kunato Developments. The scientist Ochiai had moved himself inside his body! His body was recovered and is at Shinatose Labs too. I see. Inside Norio Kunato? Do we have to fight? Give it up, Lalah. We can't allow anything to threaten Sidonia. Ochiai should still care about us! Captain, XO Midorikawa is here. Send her in. Excuse me. Um... excuse me! Hiyama-san? Midorikawa, what do we know about Ochiai, I mean, the Hybrid Kanata? We don't know where it is. It seems to have left Lem. It'll take time for him to recover his Ena. He probably wanted to avoid the risk of running into the Gauna before them. Right. Um, Captain, may I ask you something? Go ahead. Um, it's about Ochiai. He's supposed to be dead. Why is he alive? I thought you might know... Because... we are the Immortal Council. Lalah! The Immortal Council? The highest governing body on Sidonia, comprised of immortals... It wasn't an urban legend? We can't keep it a secret any longer, Kobayashi. We should tell her, at least. True. The material that can pierce a Gauna core... the Kabi... Do you know how it was discovered? Yes. Six hundred years ago, the Sidonia encountered a mysterious ruin in space, where it was discovered by chance. We were the ones who investigated it. It was a special space that cut off Heigus particles. We found the Gauna there. Gauna! --Run, Kobayashi! --Saito-kun! Suzuki was eaten! Ochiai, give the order to retreat! We didn't have a way to fight back. We had no choice but to go further in. In that space, with nowhere to run, we saw it for the first time. We discovered the one way to defeat the Gauna, the Kabi, and became heroes, the first in Sidonia's history to defeat them. And... That's where the research into immortality began. Ochiai dedicated himself to researching the Gauna. He came to believe that they may be the ultimate life form. And at last, he tried to fuse human and Gauna. Ochiai was obsessed with the Gauna. And a century ago, when he created the Hybrid, he parted ways with the Sidonia. He ejected the Kabizashi and allowed the Gauna inside, causing the 4th Gauna War. You know that much, right? That was... because he wanted to prove the Gauna were after the Kabi! In fact, the Gauna are drawn not just by the Kabi, but by anything that uses the Heigus particles. That's why the Sidonia was in danger. We captured Ochiai and took his research data, locking them both securely away beneath Kunato Developments. But he rebelled against us again. The blood worm that we found in Kunato's body was used as a medium to take over his body. What day is it? I've been out for that long? Wait, Tanikaze! I'm fine! I'm home! Nobody's here? "Tsumugi” "Tsumugi” Tsumugi? "Tsumugi” "Tsumugi” Is somebody here? Is somebody here? Is somebody here? Is somebody here? Tsumugi! Tanikaze-san... I'm so glad. You're safe. I'm so glad... Me too... I thought you were gone... Thank you, Tanikaze-san! Are you okay now? I heard you did something crazy! I wasn't even really thinking... Are you worried about me, Tanikaze-san? Of course! And that's... because I'm needed as a weapon for Sidonia? What are you talking about? I'm sorry! I know it's not the time, but-- No, I want to hear you say it! If I died, would you...? That won't happen! I promise! Never talk... ...about dying again, Tsumugi... Promise me. Okay! ...will be moving. We thank those of you in the residential block. See, it's open. O-Okay! You don't need to be so nervous. Now let's go. D-Don't let me go! Wow! I'm flying! Hasn't that happened a lot of times? You seem fine now, huh? Yes! Tanikaze-san, how'd you get permission for me to go to the residential block? The captain gave special permission. Is it okay for me to get this close to a building? It's fine. This is the oldest part of Sidonia. Nobody lives here. If you sit there, the building will collapse! It's fine. Looks like someone else was here first. We'll be going. Take your time! Wh-Where are we? It's the sea. You said you wanted to swim, right? The sea! It smells so good, right En? I decided to use some fancy tea, just for today. Hey! Hey, hey! Tsumugi! It's the pleasant scent of the sea, right En? Tanikaze-san, thank you so much! I... never thought I'd get a chance to do something like this. When I saw the residential block today, I was so excited, I forgot I could fly! That's why you were so scared? Yes. But it was a new experience, I had so much fun! I'm so happy I could die... I did it again... I'm sorry. What's wrong, Tsumugi? It's nothing! Tsumugi? I'm sorry. You were trying so hard to let me have fun... It's okay. I'll protect you no matter what, Tsumugi. So don't cry. I--- I'm not scared of dying in battle at all! But... if... if... If I could be a normal size, be human... ...and then be with you, just once... When I think about that... I can't stop crying! What am I saying? It doesn't matter whether you're human! You're fine as you are! It doesn't matter how big you are! You're only 15 meters taller than me, anyway! I'm going to live a long time, so that I can be with you as long as possible until I die! I love you, Tsumugi! Tanikaze, I'm feeling dizzy... Are you okay? T-Tanikaze-san? A-Are you okay? 7 Binding memories together, far beyond the horizon 7 --What? --What's going on? 7 The two are connected by a life they know is real 5 --What? --What's going on? 7. The two are connected by a life they know is real 7 7 The two are connected by a life they know is real 5 There's music throughout the whole residential block... 7.

The Doctor proved my innocence. Will Mozuku go back to normal? We won't know how much of her mind and memories we can bring back until we try. But we can regenerate her body. I'm the one who broke Ochiai's seal, for my own glory and to get at Tanikaze. Mozuku did nothing wrong! Please... save her! Kunato-kun... "Upgraded Tsugumori" Are you thinking that there's no place for you on the Sidonia? I'm sorry. I used to think the same thing, so... I'm Toutarou Yamano. Yamano? Yes. Eiko Yamano, the one who the Gauna ate, was my sister. She was on your team, along with you and Tanikaze. She had a brother? I was still young when she died. Do you know how many years it's been since then? Hah, hah, hah! Your sister's a Gauna! You should just throw yourself into the reactor! Sister... Suppression Force down! The Gauna have breached our final defense line! I see... It felt like it was yesterday. I had you join my team. I look forward to working with you. Yes, me too. We need to get this thing running in 60 hours! You there! No slacking! The Large Gauna Cluster is close, but I think we'll make it. The Large Gauna Cluster has passed Planet Eight. It will reach us in 240 hours. If the Yukimori gets built, we can fire the Graviton Radiation Emitter before the enemy arrives. All we have to do now is find the primary core... The Large Gauna Cluster is sending Gauna to Lem! "Warning" The Large Gauna Cluster is sending Gauna to Lem! "Warning" "Warning" Are they...? "Warning" "Warning" A large number of Gauna Pods are heading for Lem! A large number of Gauna Pods are heading for Lem! They're after the collectors! At their current rate of speed, they'll reach Lem within 48 hours! Did they analyze the brain of the pilot the Intelligent-Type Gauna devoured, and learn our plans? Midorikawa, form a Suppression Force comprised of all Mizukis and Series 19s, and launch immediately. Yes ma'am! XO Midorikawa to all ships in the Mizuki fleet. We are heading to Lem to defend the Stellar Energy Collectors. Is it okay to send this many ships with the Large Gauna Cluster so close? If we lose the collectors, we lose anyway. I thought they weren't going to attack them. Well, it's the Gauna. Who knows? The Suppression Force has completed their nine-ship linkage. Go! Tanikaze-san... Tsumugi. You want it done in two days? It's not that easy! We'll do what we have to. Our top priority is tuning up the rear propulsion system, and then... "Tsumugi” Tsumugi. Captain? I want to talk to you. Do you have a moment? Captain? Where do I start? It was so long ago... I was in my teens, so about 700 years ago. Seven hundred years? Yes, I guess it's been that long... Back then, I was just a girl who became a pilot, because there was a pilot I looked up to. They were a better pilot than anyone else. They'd even managed to defeat a Gauna, back when the Gardes were far less powerful and there was no Kabi. "Hiroki Saito defeats another Gauna!" and there was no Kabi. "Hiroki Saito defeats another Gauna!" "Hiroki Saito defeats another Gauna!" A true genius, head and shoulders above everyone else. "Hiroki Saito defeats another Gauna!" "Hiroki Saito defeats another Gauna!" There was even a plan to take their personality and memories and copy them. There was even a plan to take their personality and memories and copy them. That was Hiroki Saito. The one who raised you underground. M-My grandfather? But... 700 years ago... He wasn't your grandfather. You are Hiroki Saito's clone. A special version, made using many forbidden... ...genetic technologies. She told me everything. My grandfather, her, and Hiyama-san, and the scientist Ochiai. The captain had seemed so far away and out of reach, but now she seemed like someone I'd known for a long time. Thank you for telling me. I've done whatever it took to keep Sidonia alive. But Saito denied immortality. He raised you in the usual way. Maybe what I've done is the same as Ochiai, just to a lesser degree. Captain... Even now, I'm sending you and the other pilots to your deaths, and telling myself it's to protect Sidonia. Maybe I'm a little tired. Sidonia only made it this far because of you! Grandpa looked really satisfied, near the end. Tanikaze... I believe in you, Captain! This will be our last battle. I'm counting on you, Tanikaze. Yes ma'am! The Gauna force heading to Lem has split up! One is heading towards us! --How many? --Multiple Gauna Pods, containing approximately 6,000 in each one of them! They want to delay us. Which means... We'll shake them off at full speed. All ships, move to high alert! Ga-729 is firing a Heigus Particle Cannon! Evasive maneuvers! This is the Suppression Force. We have engaged the Gauna! What's the situation? The Mizuki's link has been broken. Their speed is dropping! The Suppression Force was attacked en route? The Garde Units and Tsumugi are engaging them! Tsumugi! They keep aiming for us specifically! Link up the Mizukis again! Ship #8 is falling behind! Our propulsion system is damaged. Go on without us! Garde Units, return to your ships! There's no end of them! They're leaving us! It's over! They're leaving! Don't give up, everyone! Let's go back together! Tsumugi-san! Tsumugi! "Contact Lost" Tsumugi! "Contact Lost" "Contact Lost" We've lost contact with Mizuki Ship #8 and Tsumugi! We've lost contact with Mizuki Ship #8 and Tsumugi! The Suppression fleet has escaped, except for Ship #8. But at their current speed, the Gauna will reach Lem before them! Launch the Series 20. But it's not finished. I don't care! Yesterday you said I had two days! We did those welds fast, and we haven't tested them! Another change with the Large Gauna Cluster! It's accelerating towards Sidonia again! Impossible... It still had the power to accelerate? It's moved its Ena to the rear to increase its propulsion! A huge number of Gauna have launched from the Large Gauna Cluster! There are... There are an estimated 100,000 enemies in the group! At their head is Ga-722, Intelligent-Type Gauna! There's so many... They're attacking us, too? And our autonomized Gardes can't handle that Intelligent-Type... Even if the Series 20 is fast, it can't protect them both! Do we prioritize defending Sidonia, and regroup... ...or bet on the Suppression Force? We'll intercept the Gauna. Turn the ship and prepare a bombardment! Deploy our defense units! The Series 20 will proceed to Lem as planned. I'm sorry, everyone... I didn't want to let any of you die... I want to go to Tsumugi now. But I can't leave Sidonia now... Captain! The Series 20 will join the defense. I can still make it after I take out the Intelligent-Type Gauna... There isn't time. If we want to take out the Large Gauna Cluster, the Series 20 needs to go to Lem, now. But then Sidonia will... Director Sasaki, let me use the Upgraded Tsugumori Il. You know that not just anybody can use that, right? This is unofficial, but it's my training records with the Tsugumori. What is this? You've been training since you were a child? And look at these amazing ratings! The Upgraded Tsugumori I isn't autonomous. It can fight the Intelligent-Type. Fine. Get the Upgraded Tsugumori Il ready, now! Kunato... Go. Leave Sidonia to me. Right. You can do it, Yukimori! Tsumugi... Listen, it's sturdy, but it can't take a hit from a Graviton Radiation Emitter. Understood! I'm telling you this because you've never understood! Tanikaze, heading out! Upgraded Tsugumori Il, launching! Releasing propulsion device! Tanikaze-san! You fell asleep, huh? Tsumugi-san! Wake up! She lost an important organ, but this ship doesn't have the facilities to fix it anymore! No! If it weren't for her, we'd be long dead... Ga-729 is heading back to us. Anybody who still has ammo, get ready to intercept! It's hopeless... We don't have enough firepower... We need to defeat every Gauna we can, for Sidonia's future! Yeah. How else can we repay Tsumugi-san? That's right! Don't give up yet! Ga-729 will arrive shortly! Fire! There's not enough firepower! "Warning: No Core-Piercing Rounds Remaining” Ga-729 is disintegrating! What was that? Something just pierced through the Gauna Pod's primary core! Tanikaze-san! Ram attack successful! Tsumugi! Tanikaze-san... Where are you? Right here. I'm right here! I--- ...I don't... ...want to be apart... ...from you anymore... Tanikaze-san... Tanikaze-san, get Tsumugi-san to Sidonia, now! Hashine, Tanikaze-san needs to meet up with the main Suppression Force! What are you doing? Taking her with me. There's a bio-tank on the primary Mizuki. But in the state she's in... It's too dangerous! It's the only way. The fleet has taken 63% casualties! Ships #2 and #4, hold off the Gauna Pods on the starboard side! Captain, Collector Sphere 4 was destroyed! Forget it. For now, we focus on defending Sphere 7, the one right in front of us! Roger! Only Spheres 6 and 7 made it. We need to defend them no matter what. Maintain speed! If you lose too much speed, Lem's gravity well will draw you in! Right! "Communication Request” One Garde down. Ga-721, Intelligent-Type Gauna! Die! Shit! Don't let it get away! High-density Heigus signal detected from Ga-721! No! It's going to destroy the collector! High-speed flying object approaching from outside the combat area! Its speed is incredible! The Intelligent-Type Gauna disintegrated! The high-speed object rammed it! The Yukimori? Tanikaze? No, that's...! The Hybrid Kanata... No, Ochiai! Impossible! He was still outside the star system when we left! Shoot him down, Gardes! He's after the Collector Spheres! Get him! Honoka team, 3-1 Clasp! Roger! Got him! He's tough! The collector! Ochiai's Ena is expanding rapidly! He's absorbed the energy... No! Destroy it now! But... It's better than giving it all to him! Roger! Ship #4 is badly damaged! One hundred twenty Gardes were destroyed! Multiple enemy Gauna disintegrated! He's hitting friend and foe alike... "Warning: Heigus Particle Signal” "Warning: Heigus Particle Signal” Oh no! The flagship! Oh no! The flagship! Ochiai! Get him! Tanikaze! Get Tsumugi to a bio-tank! Tanikaze-san! It's okay now, Tsumugi! Ochiai's heading for Collector Sphere 7! Tanikaze! Let me handle Ochiai! What are you going to do? Normal weapons can't penetrate his armor! He has a Graviton Radiation Emitter, too! Even the Yukimori... I have a plan! Ochiai! You came after me alone? You must be Saito's clone, Nagate Tanikaze. It's just like it was a hundred years ago, huh? Then... The collector is falling into Lem! He shot it down himself? I thought he was after its energy! Ochiai is still going after the Collector Sphere! A Series 19's propulsion system can't handle that gravity. Tanikaze, only you and the Yukimori can follow him. Defeat Ochiai and protect the collector! Roger! Our second defense line is about to be breached! The Large Gauna Cluster is still approaching! It's on a collision course with us! Observation team, have we identified its primary core? We've narrowed it down to 60 candidates, but we're not sure which is the real one! Even with the energy from the collectors, we can't fire the emitter that many times! Narrow it down further! Roger! Deploy all our defensive units! Stop them at the last defense line, no matter the cost! Gauna... Kunato unit, Ga-490 is approaching! Be careful! Stop it, Hoshijiro! Stay away! I can finally get revenge, sister... All units, open fire! Ga-722 has broken through the defense line on its own and is continuing the fight! I'll delay the Intelligent-Type Gauna with the Upgraded Tsugumori Il. Okay! Yamano team, turn off your autonomous mode! We'll fight the Intelligent-Type! Roger! Multiple enemy Gauna have landed on the Garde launch port! Gauna intrusion warning is in effect! All crew, get to shelters, and connect your safety belts! Everybody, stay calm! --I'm scared! --Oh no... It's okay! Multiple Gauna have entered the residential block! The Kabizashi vault has been destroyed! The Gardes can't stop them in time! Heigus. Particle. Cannon. Get down! The Upgraded Tsugumori Ii! Get out of here! It's fast! But... There! Damn it! One Gauna down! Toutarou! Go, Kunato-san! Roger! Shit! I can do this! Just a bit more! “No Ammo Remaining" What? Is this the end? Toutarou? I won't let you have all the glory for yourself! The Intelligent-Type Gauna has disintegrated! Kunato and Yamano have destroyed the Gauna inside the residential block! I did it, sis... Well done, Yamano. You're pretending to be right in my firing line, aren't you? I suppose you want me to fire and expose my firing port? The Yukimori has entered the convective envelope! The pilot seat of Tanikaze's Garde is rising in temperature! His heart rate is exceeding 180! Tanikaze, stay away from Lem's core! He knows the max temperature the Yukimori can handle! The Large Gauna Cluster is about to hit the satellite! It's like... the whole satellite's just a toy... Observation team, let's go! Deploy the observation network! Begin searching for the primary core! "Linking Observation Information” "Releasing Amplification Limits (Not Recommended) (Not Recommended) (Not Recommended)" I found the primary core! We can get out of here, everyone! Nagate, it's all up to you now! How long will you be able to move like that? Tanikaze is entering the radiative layer. The temperature of his pilot's seat is rising rapidly! He can't keep this up! Tanikaze-san! Even the Yukimori won't last much longer! His cooling systems can't keep up! His engines may be fine, but he won't last! Your human body can't last any longer. You're mine. What? You... You pretended to slow down? Secondary detonation successful. Primary core sighted! Lalah... The Ena in your body has attached to your brain. Outside this life support device, you'll die. I'm sorry, Lalah! This is all I can do right now. But someday, I swear... ...I'll get you out of that! I love this! Thank you, Ochiai! So you're going to kill me, Tanikaze? Does anyone think about humanity's future as much as me? For a thousand years, no one has been able to speak to the Gauna. And I succeeded in talking to them. You can't destroy the Large Gauna Cluster! That's... a memory device! A collection of all the information about the universe... It would take thousands of years to understand it all... Now that I've become the ultimate life form, I can solve its mysteries... I can even leave humanity's seed forever... With my existence, humanity has surpassed its incompleteness as a life form... And you would... ...ruin it all? You don't have the right to end our species! I am a Knight of Sidonia. I have to kill you. Wait! You don't want to see Shizuka Hoshijiro again? I can grant your wish! Tanikaze has destroyed Kanata and secured the collector! I'm returning to base! We did it! Tanikaze! The temperature is still rising inside Tanikaze's Garde! The damage is destroying its airtightness! "Garde Pilot Survival Limit Reached" "Garde Pilot Survival Limit Reached" "Switching to Autonomous Mode" It's up to you now... ...everyone. The Yukimori has switched to autonomous mode! It's 50,000 kilometers from the Mizuki! Autonomous...? He's willing to die? The Garde will be okay, but its pilot won't... It was the only way to defeat Ochiai... Tanikaze? You knew this would happen? Don't give up, Tanikaze! You always came home alive, right? Bye, Tsumugi... Tanikaze-san! Tsu-Tsumugi left her bio-tank! Tsumugi, your Ena can't help you inside the star! Come back! Tsumugi! You can't do it in the shape you're in! No, stay away, Tsumugi! Tanikaze-san! Her mass is dropping! The Ena's being worn away! Tsumugi! Go back, Tsumugi! I'm fine! Tanikaze-san. Tsumugi... Why? Please let me help you. The temperature in Tanikaze's Garde is dropping! Its airtightness is recovering? She used her Ena to seal it? Tsumugi! I-I'm fine! Please, Tsumugi! Go back! No... No! No! Tsumugi! Tanikaze-san... I--- I'm glad... ...I was born. Thank you. "Disintegration Confirmed" Tsumugi! Collectors connected! Energy transmission beginning! That's the collector Tanikaze-san and Tsumugi protected... Please, protect Sidonia! It's so close... It won't make it in time. Sidonia will be... The Large Gauna Cluster will make contact imminently! Energy is coming in from the collector! Energy charge 93%! It's surpassed the criticality point! Target the primary core of the Large Gauna Cluster! Target locked! Graviton Radiation Emitter, final safety device, released! Fire. The core's still there! It didn't disintegrate! There's a huge gravity wave right in front of us! Did it use gravity to deflect it? Prepare the Heavy Mass Cannon. The Primary Core Shaft Mass Cannon? We'll fire while their primary core is exposed. Hurry! Roger! Five hundred kilometers until impact! Primary Core Shaft Barrel is ready to use! Okay, everyone out of the barrel! Hurry! Artificial Kabi Mass Round, loaded! This barrel and round were a gift from our ancestors... Please, protect Sidonia! "Round Loading Complete" "Round Loading Complete" Primary Core Shaft Mass Cannon loaded! "Round Loading Complete" Heigus ducts and bullet accelerator device connected! Activate the main engines! The Large Gauna Cluster! Open Gunport 1! Fire. The Large Gauna Cluster has disintegrated! Footage from the Sidonia! They've destroyed the Large Gauna Cluster! We won. We did it... We really did it. Yeah. We won. We won! It's okay now. Drink this. Thank you. There she is. Over there. Captain, we brought a stretcher! Captain? No way... It's an honor! I'm fine! Just don't move. Hey, what's wrong? The mask? It was in the way, so I took it off. It's been centuries since I've seen that expression on your face... Tanikaze... Tsumugi... Ena pollution of Planet Seven was found to be minimal. The authorities have announced their intent to immediately begin improving the environment and begin colonization. She figured out how the blood worm's personality copy technology works? Wow, Grandma... And this Ena was clinging to a deep, deep gap in the Yukimori. Does that mean... Um, we found this during the rebuilding efforts. Tsumugi... Tanikaze-san, are you okay? I'm sorry, this is embarrassing. No... --Bye! --I'm sorry... --Was he okay? --Yeah! Tanikaze-san. Are you really okay? Yes. I can walk on my own. One, two. One... No... Is that you, Tsumugi? Grandma figured out how Ochiai's personality transfer worked easily. For her, transferring Tsumugi's personality to the body of Hoshijiro that the Gauna had regenerated was simple. I thought I'd never see you again... Tanikaze-san? Um... I'm... I'm human now! Do you still like me in this form? Welcome back, Tsumugi! Hooray! Tanikaze-san! Hooray! Hooray! No! We said we'd all go when Daddy got back! I can go on my own! Wait, Nodoka! "Environmental Bureau" Nodoka! Day 26, Month 13 of Seven-Year 4. Sidonia is leaving on its journey again, with about half the ship deciding to stay behind. Nodoka-chan! Izana-chan! Yuhata! It's been a long time. I'm going to be a great pilot like you! Good luck. Leave Sidonia to me. I'm counting on you, Kunato. Izana-chan, when will we meet again? When will it be, I wonder? I don't know, but if you're in trouble, I promise I'll be there for you. So when I'm in trouble, come to help me, okay? Okay! Captain Midorikawa, the departure ceremony is about to begin! Seed Ship Sidonia will now set off in search of new lands!
