Beep Welcome my fellow aviation enthusiasts! On board our Swiss flight LX64 from Zurich to Miami. Should you be thinking 'I know that guy! ' you may be right. A mere 5 years have passed, I've grayed some more and I'm fully equipped with magnifying glasses now. My co-pilots however get constantly younger. Today I'm flying with my charming colleague Jenny Knecht. Without giving away too much: It's her birthday today! I'm looking forward to this flight and especially to tomorrow. We're going to visit our flight school, not by car but being picked up by the student pilots in Vero Beach. Join us on the flight school tour. It's going to be awesome, I promise! Wonderful! - I'm ready. Stop horsing around! Right turn and right again on taxiway E, northbound to holding position E2. Suddenly I've lost all trust in the MD-11. But that aircraft was my baby. Suddenly it became just a ruthless tube that could really let you down. Psst! Auto pilot is coming off. Checked. Hi, good morning! - Hi, how are you? I'm Jenny. Hi Marcus. How is the situation for Miami? The route is mostly above water. Let me get my specs set up. Water as far as the eye can reach. The routing Santiago - Lajes (Azores) - Gander I see you constructed an elegant rerouting in order to avoid extended range planning (ETOPS). Let's talk weather. We caught a glimpse beforehand Similar conditions at destination and alternate. Looks like a smooth ride. Somewhere there's an ILS approach out of service. These are the restrictions. - That's alright. I see, Lajes (LPLA) that's the ILS you mentioned but the weather is OK there. Nice work! Approved! Let's take a look at the en route weather. No significant weather in sight. I see you've routed us smoothly along the North Atlantic track for a bit. No loops! - Exactly! This dispatch planning resembles a piece of art! About the fuel... We did the fuel calculations earlier. We're going to take extra fuel due to the thunder storms in the area. Expecting takeoff runway 16, which is dry. Tailwind 4 kn and 16°C - That should work just fine. I'd say we're ready for departure then. Tip top! - Ciao, bye bye! Briefing room 10, right? - Yeah, no.10 Good morning everyone! A very warm welcome everyone! We're going to Miami. I've got the best assistant, Jenny is going to brief you. Alright, flight time today is 10h 5 min. Once again we're going to be mostly over water. We're leaving Europe in western France, crossing the North Atlantic and possibly catching a glimpse of the Bahamas. We're expecting a smooth flight, even when crossing the Atlantic. Alright, see you in a bit. There's our bus. Wait for us! Today's a first. In my entire career, the co-pilot never brought cake. That's the female touch. Wait, you didn't bring the cake? - I did! We thought you had some. - Of course I did! Is it your birthday today? - Yes. Happy birthday! ' Thank YOU guys! Another year has passed. - Yeah, I'm pushing 3O now. Oh boy! For the first time, I'm closer to 30. Wow, pretty young! Thanks, Jenny! Thank you guys! - You're welcome. Thanks for bringing us. Hello there. The film team is approved by us. - Okay. Great. Thanks. I've got the newest wind. That's fine. Jenny, how far are your preparations? What's missing? - The oxygen mask test. Ground for cockpit, oxygen test will follow. Perfect. Shall I ask for routing clearance? Phone off, I'm off the grid. Delivery, good day, LX64. Airbus A330 with weather information "O" at gate E34, unable for runway 28, for clearance, please. LX64, good day, runway 16 to Miami, VEBIT 3S departure route, transponder code 3003. Runway 16 to Miami, VEBIT 3S departure route and transponder 3003. I will call you back when ready, LX64. Good! Let's make a plan here. Expecting VEBIT 3S routing. Runway 16 straight ahead to 1 mile from Kloten or 2000ft whichever is later. Then a left turn. There's a speed constraint. Maximum 210kt, then minimum 4000ft, then intercept 253° towards... That's course 233° to BREGO point, then ZH554, 558 and VEBIT point. Minimum altitudes 5000ft at BREGO, 6000ft at ZH554, and 7000ft at waypoint ZH558. We've got that in the box (FMS). Decision speed would be 151 kt up to now. Full reverse thrust. (In case of emergency) Otherwise we continue to rotate at 154kt. Take off safety speed 158kt, quite close together. We'd then follow the engine out standard departure (SID) 2.4/4.8, slightly left, turning left back to Kloten. Once on course we retract the flaps, minimum altitude 3440ft, climbing to 5000ft. If we're in a rush we request to turn back with vectors from 5000ft for the ILS runway 16. Otherwise we take it easy, engine out departure to GIPOL. Holding pattern, trouble shooting and back. Overweight landing, back here it's no problem on dry runway 16. With that weight we might blow some tires though. In that case, I'd call fire services 123,1 MHz. Probably they'd be there anyway. Shall I start the APU (auxiliary power unit)? - Yes. APU started. Cabin crew, yellow door selectors armed. LX64 fully ready. LX64, roger standby, call for start up 121 .85MHz, have a good day. 121 .85MHz, thanks, you too! Hello ground. You may lift the aircraft while we ask Standby for the rest. - Thanks a lot!

Optimum flight level 345. Looking good. You can see the mountains, too. For a moment I thought you'd recite their names, from left to right. I let you do the honors, you have a closer view. Left, the highest peak is the Finsteraarhorn (14,022 ft). The one with the flat snowfield is the Schreckhorn or Wetterhorn (13,379 ft). Then the dark walled Eiger (13,020 ft). Next Ménch (13,474 ft) and Jungfrau (13,642 ft). Well done! You just gotta love flying. Over there, last January we had our Lauberhorn airshow with Patrouille Swiss. Have you been there? Sure! Great. - With tears in my eyes, because it was so overwhelming. It was unbelievable. LX64, contact Geneva on 128.9MHz, bye! Geneva on 128.9MHz, bye! Let's keep our eyes on the road for a change. Geneva hello, LX64 passing FL145, climbing FL230. Good afternoon identified. Cleared VADAR, MILPA and NINTU, climb FL240. VADAR, MILPA and NINTU Climb FL240, LX64. That's what we've got in the box. VADAR, MILPA, NINTU (Waypoints). FL240 blue. - Checked. If you watch the Video from the Payerne Airshow... It was held in the extension of the small lake, closely followed by Payerne Air Base. The village on the left bank of the bigger lake can be seen very well. It's called Estavayer-le-Lac. They did a great job filming the A330 doing a low pass over it. Yeah, that's right. - Really awesome. Smoke! Attention: Top (90) Roll out Bambini and change of turn. A330 well done! Brilliant! Down there, I took my first flying lessons! That's the airport Grenchen (LSZG) with the flight school "Swiss Aviation Training". The small runway belongs to the Airport Grenchen. I recall a lot of training units there. Grenchen and Vero Beach. Grenchen is the training home base for SWISS training. We have a beautiful view of the lakes today. On the right is the Lake Biel. The St. Peter's Island that extends into the lake. And the Lake Neuchétel, the big one. The Neuenburgersee. - Right. In German: Neuenburgersee. That's the language border! (Swiss-French) And lastly there is "Yverdon" a small airport at the lake. Yverdon-les-Bains. - They have a harbor wake board-lift. Right, I remember water skiing there once. I've always wanted to, but never made it. We could charter a plane to fly there for wake boarding. Jenny, your ideas are unbeatable but first you have to teach me kite surfing. You got it. Wake boarding is a perfect preparation for kite surfing. So I recommend to start off with this first. Oh dear! - 134.85OMHz, LX64. Radar, hello, LX64 heavy passing FL213, climbing FL240. LX64, bonjour, identified, climb FL290. Climb FL290, LX64. Report level you're able to reach by NINTU? Ladies and gentlemen, hello again from the flight deck, this is your captain speaking. Together with my colleague Jennifer Knecht I would like to welcome you on board our A330 destination Miami. You're turning again on course to RETSA? Contact Reims on 126.285MHz, bye-bye! $0? Any comments so far? For example: "Thomi, you managed getting to cruise level without anything major going wrong? We did have a system warning on the ground though! Besides that: perfect performance! "Vent extract fault", was it? It fixed itself as it seems. That's what I expected because it happened before maintain FL34O when reaching - 1000ft to go. and contact Bordeaux on 123.63OMHz, au revoir! Contact 123.63OMHz and maintain FL34O when reaching, LX64. ...contact 132.415MHz, au revoir! 132.415MHz, Air Cargo 86222, so long. Bordeaux, bonjour, LX64 heavy approaching FL340. LX64, bonjour Madame... Let me jump back to the warning message we got at the engine startup: "vent extract fault". Vent extract fault. - Checked. That's mainly the air-condition for our equipment downstairs. The computers in our basement are sitting in racks and are generating a great deal of heat. We cool them down by using exhaust air from the cabin. Exhaust air from the cabin is directed over our instruments behind the dashboard and then routed to our basement. The normal state can be observed on the ECAM. This rectangle represents our fuselage. These are the two exhaust valves for the cabin pressure, and we are focusing on this (third) valve. On the ground, it is completely open and the air is exhausted by a dedicated fan. It's deflected underneath the aircraft's body. During flight, it has to be shut. Closing has to begin with the first engine start, otherwise it's wide open. And this closing-command might have come too late, so the sensor reported an abnormality which was canceled by the computer itself. The cabin air travels through this pipe, through our dashboard and then into our basement next through all computer racks with the dedicated fan, and we're talking about this hatch right here. It's open on the ground and was closing too slow today. That was the reason for our warning. By now, the hatch is closed. Our tube is leak proof. In a nutshell, our plane is loaded with sensors detecting every position of hatches and valves etc. They're generating warnings if something happens out of tolerance. Sometimes they already react if expected occurrences are delayed, and that was the reason for our warning today. We've got visitors. Hi there, Helen! - Hello. Could you fill this in, please? Leave it with me, I'll fill it in later. I haven't seen this in a long time, with our old Swiss Logo attached. That's a flight-logbook of a young passenger. Seated where? Row 28. In Economy-class. She's a frequent flyer. That's Gabriela, a female frequent flyer. Date, Flight number, Destination, Flight-time. Another row holds the call-sign of the plane. Also miles being flown. Hopefully not in statute miles, Oh yes, too bad. That means converting. And the captain's signature. I recall SWISS has republished these logbooks. I still think, that this is a really neat idea. We'll set to work right now. Give me another 5 minutes. ...when you asked for the present heading, we were turning, so confirm heading 040° is good for you? Glarner Apfelsuppe! Canton of Glarus. A specialty that is new to me, too. Beautiful. ...has a good weather. Commit. As you can see, not everything here is high tech, sometimes we stick to old-school paper. We've highlighted our routing on our chart. In case of an emergency we always have to know our alternate airport right away. We took off back in Zurich, crossing the North Atlantic and ending at Miami Airport. I used some highlighters to point out our present position and which alternate airports would be attainable at the moment. I keep updating the green line, it's a poor man's moving map. - Thanks, Jenny! It highlights our current position. We're at the blue line now, next I continue in yellow. The yellow segments are special, that's why they are marked like that. Then there are the circles, the small green ones and the big red ones. If we're within the small green circles, we call it a "stop". From there we can reach an alternate airport within 1 h. First one was Zurich, then Santiago de Compostella in north west Spain. Next is Lajes. Since the circles don't intersect, we'd need more than 1 h at the yellow segment. So we draw a bigger circle. It's called ETOPS circle. (Extended range performance) We're certified for up to 3h of ETOPS operations. At the moment we'd return to Santiago, but soon we'll reach the point where Lajes would be closer. Additional to Jenny's great explanations and programming, we can see the equal time points according to our flight plan. SCQ stands for Santiago, TER stands for Lajes, Azores. That's the equal time point we just passed resulting in using Lajes airport in case of emergency. By the way, this line shows that we are not exactly sticking to our dashed flight path line but are one mile offset. Due to the precision of today's autopilots navigation, flying offset one mile adds to the level of security in such (uncontrolled) areas. That means in case of oncoming traffic, we would be separated. Especially on the same flight level. But that's a rather unlikely event. In this area of the north Atlantic, everybody is heading in the same direction. At this time of the day, all of Europe is heading for North America. In the afternoon the avalanche (of planes) turns around utilizing the jet streams from behind. We have intentionally avoided these streams blowing east. The eastbound traffic will intentionally use these streams to take the advantage of getting home faster. Meanwhile we have received the weather forecast I had ordered. Let me tear it off. This is the latest report. Miami already 84°F (29°C). And Lajes 75°F (24°C). Still beautiful. So, for the unlikely event of an emergency situation we exactly know which suitable airport is the closest. Right now, it would be Lajes, Azores. We have the latest weather from there, it's perfect. We also know which runway would be ours. At the moment ILS approach to runway'! 5. So we are prepared for any unlikely event. Thanks, Jenny. - You're welcome. W040, secondary frequency 13354kHz. Say again, primary frequency for New York? Primary frequency 17952kHz, secondary 13354kHz. Alright, New York control is 17952kHz, secondary 13354kHz, CAY903 (Cayman Airlines).

You got the frequencies? - Yeah. Who is it? You have to sing, Thomi! - I have to sing? Oh dear... Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Jenny Happy birthday to you! Thank you! Wow, how sweet! - All the best! Thank you so much! Yay! You can do that forever! But look, there's a flame! - Right. You're all so nice, thank you so much! Thank you. - Would you like a coffee or something else? I'll have one, I'd like to have a coffee. - Cafe creme? Lungo creme. I'm fine, thanks indeed. I'll have to take a picture. - Yeah, me too. Theoretically, even Thomi has a camera... Thank you for visiting. Bye! - Bye! Perfect! Slow? Okay, now. So nice! - The flash beats everything. You have to spend your birthday flying with your boss! How bad is that? - No, it's mega cool! The bottom is not suitable for eating, right? I wish you all the best, enjoy. - Thank you. Thanks a lot! Delicious! 1758, FL360. Request FL 360 No ATC required. I had that before.. PAN-PAN-PAN, all aircraft. (distress call) PAN-PAN-PAN, all aircraft. Pan-Pan-Pan. - On Airway L455. 30miles south of.. DELTA676 deviating to the right. FL380, deviate to right for weather. - It's pretty good right here, actually. He is at our Flight level.. Do you still hear him? - Yeah. Just "Pan-Pan, deviating right due to weather to FL380." But I don't read him anymore. He has stopped talking. Yeah. I'll check with him. Got it. - Bye now. It's Delta, right? - Yes. Delta flight, declaring Pan-Pan due to weather, FL380. Could you give me the exact position again, it's LX64 as well on FL380. Utter silence. - calling on guard about the weather information can you say? He asked you. - Yeah, but I am on the other Freq. Calling on guard. LX64 calling on guard. We received a Pan call by a DL flight. Assuming that he was deviating due to weather, I was just verifying his position. Thanks. "Thanks"! That's the one down there, but I want the other one. If he was on our route, he wouldn't deviate. He must be right in there. - Yeah. There are in general two different types of emergency calls. The first one is the Mayday call. That means there is an actual emergency. Furthermore, there is the Pan-Pan-Pan call. That call indicates some urgency or a possible emergency. We just heard a call like this on the emergency frequency. It came from DL676. (Virgin Islands-JFK) They spoke about problems due to weather, probably because of these thunderclouds northwest of us. I guess he couldn't talk to anybody about it, he probably couldn't get clearance via ATC. Now he just angles off to the left or to the right. He wanted to inform all the other aircraft about a possible conflict in terms of separation. Using the emergency frequency guarantees maximum attention. And as you can see, we react immediately to a call like that. I didn't get through to him, but the controller in Bermuda heard me, so I had to explain it to him. But I still don't have any reliable information where exactly the DL is. It doesn't seem to be threatening for us, even if he's on the same FL as we are, and that was the most critical issue. 'Cause we're on FL380, too. Fortunately, today we have the TCAS. (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) If this aircraft gets too close, we would see it on the display. Therefore I'm not concerned. LX64 Oceanic advising at JIMAC you can choose between FL37O or FL41O due to traffic. FL41O doesn't work for us... - Standby, LX64. Request FL370, LX64. LX64, Roger. Cross 20 miles east of JIMAC at FL370. Cross 20 miles east of JIMAC at FL370, LX64. Right-hand, you can see it quite well now, actually. It's a pretty small thundercloud, but it was foreseeable that we would fly into the so-called tops of it. Out of convenience I decided to divert south, therefore I needed clearance from New York. What we got, but primarily I'm keeping us out of this cloud by relying on my eyes. With NY, I negotiated a maximum of 10 miles range (left and right) but I'll probably only need 5 mi since I can already turn back. I just want to make sure that Jenny can enjoy her soup without spilling it. Right. Of course it's very comfortable if you can actually see the cloud. Thereby you can estimate if you are going to hit it or if you can avoid it. Although it's not a vicious thundercloud. Maybe the northern part up there, but this little section over here is harmless. You mean the upper edge? - Right! Regarding the evaluation of the traffic situation in Orlando, I have to say that we're not quite there yet. I expect that to happen in the near future, when planes will have internet access. Soon we'll be able to retrieve much more information. At home on my iPad, I can trace the air situation, I can see everybody who's up there. If I compare that to the information up here, there are some discrepancies that will likely be dissolved within a few years. We have iPads on the B777, but if you have an iPad or an old model like ours isn't the question. It's all about the connectivity. Next year, we will modify this planes so that the passengers have access to the internet. Of course we're going to snatch a connection, too. Not for endless Google research, but to transfer a new quality of information. Color images, radar images and images of the airspace will be transmitted right to the cockpit. We're really looking forward to that, this will improve the situation awareness in the cockpit. JB501 (Jet BIue) position LECOG 1951, FL340. OLEDO next OLEDO time 2021 GANIS point next SELCAL check backup frequency 6586 kHZ. The Miami airport is quite busy. There are four runways, three of them are parallel. They are numbered 08L(left), 08R(right) and 09 on the southern side. There also is a diagonal one, Runway 12. We expect to land either on 09, on 12 or on 08R, but that wouldn't be convenient. 08L is too short. We're parked down here on the southern tip of terminal "J"(Juliet) , so RWY 09 or RWY 12 would be perfect. We'd have a very short taxi time before reaching our parking position. Quit horsing around! I have to say something soon, so here we go! LX64, Miami center, hello. radar contact 25 miles north east of the south west intersection affirm, LX64, hello. Our A330 is in excellent shape. No restrictions, we adjusted the fuel prediction. 5 tons, right now we've got about 25 minutes holding time, but I guess that's going to expand a bit. Yeah. Weather is okay Our options are either to divert to Fort Lauderdale or to commit to Miami. The landscape is completely flat. Absolutely no obstacles, besides the Four Seasons hotel which would be biggest hurdle while approaching Over 3000 ft, we're completely safe. Our arrival route is HIGHLY6 via OSOGY point Facing east, that's 16000 at MILSY, you entered that. Air Transat, contact Jacksonville center, 134.85MHz. Perfect. HIGHLY6 passes north of the airfield opened leg after RUBOE point followed by whatever they give us We have to be a little flexible. We've checked the requirements for the RNAV approach on RWY 09 the computer's progress page is filled in ALT cruise level arrived. - That is checked. For the approach we're going to use the lateral navigation mode"LNAV" down to a minimum altitude of 460 ft. DL42 Miami center, hello. I'll enter it for you. - Thank you. Intermediate altitude 3000 ft until HODLE 9.2 miles off the runway. For distance measurement we'll have to rely on the GPS Right. Lateral navigation LNAV and vertically via track/flight path angle Flight path angle -3°. Cross checked with the altitude versus distance table or likely visual. - Yeah. Configuration: full flaps, manual landing, manual braking. Autobrake off, full reverse. Initially. Manual landing... - All manual. As always. If that doesn't work out, the missed approach would be 800 ft. Right turn to Virginia Keys into the holding pattern. 3000 ft altitude and speed at minimum drag. Flaps up at approximately 21 0kt. Performance calculations are done. No further comment We'll cross check that anyways once we've got a runway assigned. Alternative ILS on runway 12 is saved as backup Go around leads to the same place identical conditions, 3000 ft, a simple ILS12 approach. FL380. - You calculated the performance. The wind has even turned to headwind now, there shouldn't be a problem. So far, so good. Any questions? I'm ready. - Let's go. That's Freeport (Bahamas) down there. You have control. - I have control. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. I hope you had a pleasant flight so far. We are northeast of Miami, we will soon continue our descent in the direction of Miami airport. We are expecting to land in about 40 minutes. We hope to get a great view of the Bahamas, especially from the left side of the aircraft. The turquoise blue sea and the sandbanks puts us into a holiday mood, too. The weather in Miami is quite nice, slightly cloudy, there are no thunderstorms in sight at the moment. The temperature is a pleasant 31°C. We start preparing for our landing approach now, I'd like to take the opportunity to say goodbye to you already. It has been a pleasure having you on board, we wish you a wonderful stay in Florida, please enjoy your holiday. We hope to see you again real soon, thank you. Very pretty! Look at the turquoise water, Jenny! All these reefs and sandbanks create this turquoise blue color, that view really gets me into a holiday mood! Gorgeous.

We 're not done with our checklist, yet. Then drive to the hotel. Nothing special, but it's a fantastic beach side location. Don't forget: If you want to join us tomorrow, get up early! We have to be at Kendall airport at 9:00 am. We can't wait to fly to Vero Beach for our flight-school visit. " I'm ready! And if there's some salsa on the radio... That's good. Great! Yes, finally! Sunshine! Jet boat Miami How do I define "vacation"? Oh, that's a tough one! For me, it demands a lot of will-power to go on vacation. The obstacle is not being on vacation, but to get there. I admit it, I hate standing in line at the airport security check for two hours! I just don't have the brass neck. If I have to work, I'm there an hour in advance. Backdoor, security check, bus, airplane, work. I get that done in an hour, including the whole flight preparation. As a passenger, I have to be there two hours beforehand. No way! Miami is one of my favorite hotels. The location is great, it's right on the beach, you can dive in the turquoise blue water straightaway! After arrival, you're always a little jet-lagged. European Arrivals wake up early, regardless of when you went to bed. I usually wake up at 6 a.m. I get my running trainers on, there's a beautiful beach trail heading north for about three miles. That's a wonderful morning run. And if you manage to catch the sunrise, that's the icing on the cake. Good morning, nice to see you again. Good to seeing you again, doing well, thank you Perfectly on time, perfect weather Yes sir, - nice airport, awesome The weather should be blue skies all the way up north Do we go with this? - This is our chariot. May I take your bags. I take it, don't work for me. Have a safe flight, see you in Vero Beach All right, here we go close it properly Left side, clear prop! Yeah, right side is clear Maybe I can assist. - Let's go.. Air is coming All right Your safety Even with a marshaller, perfect service You want me to open the door? Yeah, that would be great! You have control and I do some pictures. Yeah, I see them. Are you feeling at home, Jenny? Yes, this reminds me of my time as student It calls to these nice times at Vero Beach, right? I'm soaking wet already. (...) but two separate runways and some weather restrictions. Hello everybody. Let me introduce Thomi Frick. We've already met a little while ago. Thanks for letting me burst in. Get out! I'm just visiting and happy to soak up some Vero Beach atmosphere. Jenny and I already took a trip down memory lane approaching Miami, and in few years, you will do the same. You'll fly towards Miami, Auto tune Vero Beach on the right, and you'll go: "Oh, it was so beautiful and really cool, there!" What about your questions? Is there any actual information about the aircraft type we'll be on? Is it the Bombardier Series, the Airbus or is it still written in the stars? I'll lay odds on the CSeries. The Airbus fleet will be downsized. There is a backlog that can only be reduced by retiring or retraining people to the B777 respectively the CSeries. Growth is currently taking place at Swiss Global with the CSeries and the B777. I think it's a safe bet to say that by no later than the end of next year, you'll be ready. You might be the first who get to do the initial course with the CSeries. That is a privilege, I think this is a really great aircraft. State-of-the-art. Like your Seminole with the nice glass cockpit and Moving map. The Airbus doesn't have that, I'm still dreaming of it. But we'll get there someday! People always ask me: ls pilot training really worth the effort? As a father of a 21 year old son, what do I tell a young flight enthusiast who's thinking about doing it, too? I really have to weigh my words there. But the answer is actually really simple. If it's your dream, stick to your dreams. Keep following it. If you're enthusiastic about it, you have to do it. If you're really talented, you will always find a job. I actually cut my teeth on the passion for flying. My mother used to be a flight attendant. I have encountered this world early on, my mother often took me along. I got to know the world of aviation, and I realized very early it's my world. Aside from the fact that I love flying, I really like to travel. So for me, being a pilot really is a dream job, it's the perfect mix. This might be a little premature and difficult to answer, but when can we upgrade from short-haul flights to intercontinental? Most recently, the dwell times had been quite short. About two years, right, Jenny? - Barely three years. Two or three years. Our basis has been broadened since Swiss Global and Swiss International engage in the short-haul flights. That means you most likely will have to wait about four to five years. And that's a good thing, don't be too disappointed. Flying long distance too early is never a good idea. Short-haul flights are great to gain practical experience. You can do four landings a day and really create a routine. If you switch to intercont. too soon, it can be really unsatisfying. You may even start arguing about the landings, because there are only about three per month left. Four... If Jenny flies, five. We're often asked why we train in Europe, in our case in Grenchen, and in Vero Beach as well. There are two different perspectives. Training in Europe is expensive. On the other side, we can train the European environment. And by that I mean compound, mountains, bad weather conditions, European ATC and so on. In contrast, Vero Beach is extremely economical. But the weather is always nice, well, almost always. The landscape is really plain, there are absolutely no barriers. However, there are a lot of airfields. Training here is very efficient, they need take-offs and landings, approaches and flying hours, and Vero Beach is perfect for that. The training is really intense and quite strict, downtime often falls by the wayside. Your friends and family has to get used to this, it's a full-time training which is short but really intense. Every flight is an exam, you're always evaluated. Accordingly, everyone is under pressure. You are constantly challenged without time to recapitulate anything, it goes on and on, always ahead. It takes a lot of time, willpower, discipline and diligence to manage that. Even when the weather is nice, you often sit at home boning up but with this goal in mind. It was really tough sometimes... despite all the great stuff. Who's going to fly today? Who gets to fly or has to? everybody! Who wants company? I'll take the first one. Raphael? - That's right. May I join you? - Of course. Who's the flying instructor? - Alan is my flying instructor. I will go now and tell him that I'd like to be a fly on the wall. I'm not the checker, I'm going to be speechless with amazement. last but not least Fuel mode, we have 90 gallons. Really quick CDI go to "1 Switch to one checked. And we can check the OBS. So we rotate this one. Here you see it moving down. - Okay. Very good. - Thank you. Probably a little scattered up further west with few clouds Strobe lights on. Throttle idle. Brakes released. Left sector and right side is clear. And let's make a brake check here. - Brakes checked. Check your side. Vero Beach Tower N7704D No.1 for runway 12R ready for departure time check. - thank you, take of-f. Time check - good. Take off power set rotate Extend across field N7704D Extend upwind N7704D flight power set climb check gear checked up flaps checked up cowl flaps open you can use Valkaria airport as an aiming point giving you a good position left and behind is clear turning left 30° and green light power setting glide and speed that was a good one and we go to flight safety south ramp DC to the ramp on this frequency N7704D have a nice day ready master, off electrical equipment is off throttle idle mixture cut off - That was great. Thank you. Did you like it? - You did a really good job. I liked, how you adapted the different angles with the aiming points. You did a great job like nothing You listened to the feedback and had a great touch'n go and landed perfectly on the center line. Great situation awareness! You flew independently and relaxed I liked it. Thank you. All the best. - The same to you. You have to secure the plane. - Yes, I do. So the door will not fall off! See you later. Bye! - See you, thanks. Our idea is to enable every young Swiss or other talented colleague who is a flight enthusiast to take up that profession. It is unacceptable that this decision is a question of money. I'm often asked about the total cost of the entire training. That is not an exact science, we just float a number. If the flying school is well utilized, it'll be about 132000 USD. That's the approximate amount. Our goal is that the student doesn't have to come up with extra money. An applicant who is positively assessed by us can begin with the training. There is a specified amount of money in the form of an interest-free loan that he has to repay. And we as an airline shall pay the rest. In Switzerland, we're fortunate enough to be subsidized by the state. For one, the SAT as an accredited professional college is eligible, but there's another factor that is extremely interesting for us. A new law determines that the receipts of the mineral oil tax have to be reinvested in aviation. In the future, this tax revenues will pay for approximately half of the training costs. My boyfriend is also a pilot, I met him during the training. On the very first day, he sat next to me. At first we were just friends but in Vero Beach we got to know each other. We've been together for almost five years now. A lot of people ask "Two pilots? How does that even work?!" "You never see each other!" But it is the opposite, "it's perfect for us." We both understand the fascination of flying. We have the same preferences and enjoy kite surfing together, we ride the surf and we can fly together. That's simply marvelous . I remember the accident of Halifax, when we lost a MD-11. Two good friends of mine lost their lives back then. I am sometimes asked how I deal with that. The accident was such a shock for us, that we refused to believe it actually happened. Sadly, I have to say that I got used to things like that back in the army. I remember being asked by the psychologist at the army physical if I was aware that the death rate was about 10%. What's the answer of an extremely motivated 18-year-old to this? "Of course, no problem! I have a 90% chance of surviving, that's great!" But I never expected something like that to happen in civil aviation. There was a lot of emotional defense. "It cannot be, this can't be true!" Those guys were so great, two of our best men. We knew that if they couldn't make it, none of us would have had a chance. We were really preoccupied with that. I discovered for myself, the confidence I had in the MD-11 as an airplane, as my baby, was suddenly gone. All at once it became just a ruthless tube that could really let you down. I had to recover from that experience and tell myself over and over it actually happened - and it can happen to you, too. We just have to live with that. It took us all a lot of time to cope with that hard times. Okay, the interview is over, now I'll return to another kite session Today I'll take the sail No.11. It might be a little too big, the wind has been getting up quite a bit. Stop! Thank you! I'll kite for maybe another hour, then I'll be worn out and fall asleep. I have to bank some sleep so that I'm rested for our flight back to Zurich. And I'm already looking forward to that. See you! Miami gate, hello, SWISS65 heavy.

This is your captain speaking, on behalf of my copilot Jennifer Knecht I'd like to welcome you aboard our Airbus. Back to Zurich. Let me therefore take this opportunity to apologize for the delay. The heavy thunderstorm over the airport have led to generalized delays and to a temporary handling stop. Because of this, we are running a bit behind schedule. We are currently third or fourth in line for takeoff, there are still some planes approaching. We expect to being cleared for takeoff in a little less than 10 minutes. After takeoff, we'll be able to calculate the estimated time of arrival. After that, we gladly provide you with more detailed information. We hope you feel comfortable aboard, please enjoy you flight. Thanks You have control. - I have control. Should we start before takeoff preparations? Okay. Flight controls? Checked. - Checked.

LX65, in fact, we'd like to pass 10 miles southeast of JANUS and then direct VALLY LX65 heavy, roger and let me know, when you reach JANUS Roget We won't go through that (red) area. Look! Heading 100° would have been even better and afterwards VALLY. American56 heavy, radar contact climb and maintain 16000 ft Deviations 10 miles left and right permitted Let's switch radar to manual. Yes. Can you go to JANUS now? Negative, that takes us through a central thunder LX65, we have arrivals coming in the same direction I need you to turn, heading to 050. Okay, we'll give it a try. We're heading towards JANUS now. LX65, a previous Boeing 777 went through there with no issues. Okay, thank you. I think it's not too bad. - It's better there. LX65, we have quite a smooth ride, we're heading towards JANUS. LX65 heavy, roger contact Miami center on 133.4 MHz. 133.4 MHz , LX65. Miami Center, good evening, LX65 heavy, 12000 climbing 16000, approaching JANUS. LX65, Miami center go direct to SUMRS Confirm direct to SUMRS? Affirm, direct waypoint SUMRS Great direct SUMRS, LX65. Great. Navigation SUMRS. - Checked. Ali's well that ends well. LX65, Shannon good morning radar identified cleared from SOMAX to LIZAD Good morning. By now, we are 2 hours ahead of Zurich. We have sunshine in our faces, now's a good occasion for a little throwback. We struggled with a severe thunderstorm flying out of Miami. In the afternoon, we noticed that something was gathering out there. On our way to the airport, we looked up the radar images on the internet. We also got an update once we were in the cockpit. Unfortunately, we don't have that kind of information on board officially. We're still lacking WLAN on board This one is on my private telephone bill but it was important for us to know what was really going on in Miami. This radar image here proves it quite well. There was a storm front approaching from the southwest moving towards Miami. And while getting on the bus for the airport, the storm bursted and we got stuck in traffic. The airport was temporarily forced to cease operations, they had to initiate a so-called handling stop. So no one is allowed near the aircraft because of a lightning strike. I have to say, it all went a lot smoother than I expected. We got through fairly good. After that, it was pretty much smooth cruising, it was just that one storm front. Since then, we only had some small turbulences. There wasn't much going on here for the last 7 hours. But that kind of monotony is also part of our job. London, hello, LX65 heavy on level 360. LX65, London, good morning direct to LIZAD Direct LIZAD, LX65 heavy. - That could be it. Got it! Have you seen this one from Lauberhorn? That's from last January. It's one of the two cool videos we shot ourselves. Sales (another SWISS pilot) did the actual filming with a lot of manpower and countless cameras. We did something similar in Payerne at the "Air 14 show". That was the centennial celebration of the air force, 75 years Patrouille Suisse, 25 years PC-7. We already had a great performance together with an A330. That's our Chief Flight Instructor Martin Stotzer. With his colleagues, he's in charge of the A320. That's my favorite scene, the changing of the jacket. That looks really cool. The effort was gigantic, they trained everything in the simulator in advance with the Patrouille Swiss. They even trained together with Patrouille Swiss to study the territory. Calculated turns and determined radii to make sure their choreography really works. It looks incredible! - It looked like that from the ground, too! Lukas Zeitner (ex air-defense pilot) Our colleagues from Lufthansa are a bit jealous. Awesome. Brilliant. - Top class. Let's look straight ahead once again. There may be planes crossing. No, it's too far away. Okay, here it comes. Why can't I see it? 5 miles, approximately there. There it is. Up there. J728R contact BRESNO 118.65 MHz. There's another one over there, it's passing us now. FL30 to FL35 AirFrance689 Damn haze. Let me rise! LX65, climb to level 370. Thank you, climbing level 370, LX65. Speed, vertical speed plus 700. ALT CRUISE level 370. I, too, wish you a very good morning. As you can see, we're already approaching mainland. Today, we'll start approaching France north of Brest. We'll fly south of Paris and then right into Switzerland via Basel to Zurich. Unfortunately, the weather isn't as good as I hoped it would be. I would have loved to show you the beautiful view with the mountains. But unfortunately, it's raining and visibility is pretty poor today. We're also anticipating some west wind. In defiance of the west wind, I expect a landing on runway 14. That's the busiest runway in Zurich. The location isn't ideal, since we often have a west wind flow, we're accustomed to land with a little tailwind. And that's what I'm expecting today. On the ground, it looks like this. We're going to land right here, the runway is quite long (3300 m). We will leave the runway at the second taxiway and immediately turn right so we can park at Dock E. 134.335 MHz LX65. Most of the long-haul flights go to Dock E. More precisely, Echo 35, which means we only have very limited taxi time. Right, then right again. Then we'll finally reach Zurich, and after landing, we'll be looking forward to our beds, of course. Right now, I'm already looking forward to my descent, I can hardly wait! Just one hour left, and I'm glad to take you along to Zurich. Who is calling? - LX65 heavy, on FL370. Look, Jenny. The LX19 from Newark. There, on the left. Great picture. They'd be glad if we sent them a picture, I'll take a photo. Where are you'? There! SWISS1QR, what is the ride? Smooth, LX19R Thank you. Awesome! Let me have my passenger announcement now. Arc de Triumphed in sight! Ladies and gentlemen, good morning from the cockpit. This is your copilot speaking, I hope you have enjoyed your flight so far and were able to get some rest. Currently, we're south of Paris. If you look out the left side of the aircraft, you can see the city. Within a short time, we'll start the descent to Zurich. We expect to arrive on time since we were able to compensate our delay. We are going to land in about 40 minutes. The weather in Zurich is a little rainy, the temperature is 13° Celsius. Thank you for flying Swiss, I wish you a pleasant stay in Zurich or just in case a nice onward journey. LX65 bonjour direct MELKO I'm requesting the latest weather report. Okay, Zurich has wind from 210° with 8 kn 10°C and dewpoint 9°C QNH 1012. Moderate ice forecast winter's coming! Why did I announce it has 13 degrees in Zurich? My weather forecast in Miami predicted 13 degrees for Zurich. That's good. Anticipation. LX65, direct PILON. LX65, direct to PILON. NAV set for PILON. - Okay. LX65, contact Reims 132.28 MHz, au revoir. 132.28 MHz, LX65, au revoir. Swiss19R, contact Reims on 132,28 MHz au revoir. 132,28 MHz au revoir, merci. Reims bonjour, LX65 heavy, FL 370. Bonjour, LX65 identified direct PILON call you back for descent Direct PILON, standing by for descent, LX65. Do you want a sip? - No, thanks. But it gives you wings! That stuff is horrible to me. I must be the wrong generation. - Have you tried this one? It's warm now, so it's not that tasty. But it's better than Red Bull. Liquid gummy bears. I never did a Simulator Check without it. - Really? It's just because... - That's outrageous. Usually, I don't drink it, but back in school, when I had to study a lot, I always drank it. And during training, for A320 and A330 in the simulator... I always had a half can before getting into the sim, and the rest after toilet break It became such a ritual it's psychological now, I have to pack one Red Bull and drink it. It's always been this way! It calms my nerves. You'll be awarded a gold badge from Red Bull. I thought if I do that today, it'll give me... ...wings. It always worked great in the simulator, so it'll work great now. But it isn't Red Bull, it's from Migros. "Migros Budget Energy Drink". "Support your domestic products." Yeah. - Great. AIitaliaSSJ, bonjour, identified. (Rome-London) Are you exhausted'? - Yes, Please give me some positive energy. LX65, start descent level 350 descending level 350.

There are some periods of sunshine, but then it's clouding Some pea soup fog ahead. That's Basel and the Rhine Valley. Yeah. LX19R, bonjour, reduce speed 240 knots. I call you back shortly for lower. - Roger. Now they're putting an end to our high-speed flight. Yeah, we're not on schedule anymore. Descend 190, speed 240 kt, LX787 (Brussels - Zurich) LX19, descend FL270 descending 270, Swiss19R KLM57C contact Swiss Radar (Amsterdam - Zurich) ls there something in my eye? - I don't see anything. I need my magnifying glass. It feels like an eyelash or something. I don't see it. Rub a little. - There it is! Thanks. There's not much wind up here. That's why it's so rocky. - Quite atypical, right? Yeah. Usually, we have at least a 30 kt tailwind over here. On this route, with this height restrictions near Basel, FL200 and 170, we're often above the calculated approach angle. This in combination with mostly westerly winds always creates a little bit of stress. You always have to come up with something to get the plane down. Especially the A330. - Right. It's build to glide. A motorized glider. The problem is, just like today, we're often forced to reduce the speed, it's 240 kt now. That increases the gliding and makes it even harder. The impact of the flaps decreases with dwindling speed. You have to be alert and start the slowing-down process early enough. But diving down right now doesn't cut it. Contact Swiss radar 135.67 MHz, good bye. 135.67 MHz, LX65, bye-bye. Basel is on our left. - Yeah. Swiss Radar, good morning, FL220, descending level 190, speed 240 kn LX65, identified BLM 2G arrival to hold at GIPOL your expected approach time is 54. Roger, LX65. Speed reducing. - BLM 2G to hold at GIPOL approach time 54 can we reduce the speed? Maintain speed after reaching FL 190 thereafter free speed Roger to maintain 240 kn until reaching FL190, then free speed. LX65, descend to FL 150. Descend to FL150, LX65. FL150 blue and thrust open descend Free speed at FL150 - at FL19O You're rocking, Jenny. Speed 220. Turbulences are quite uncommon for this region. I think it's because of the wind shift. We had some south wind, and now it has turned 180 degrees. A few minutes ago, it was 160... disregard holding instructions Much better, LX65, thanks. Now we have a northern wind with a speed of 30 kt, it has turned completely. Speed 240 kt. LX65, descend FL 130 at 1500 or greater Landing FL130 is 1500 or more FL130 blue.

As expected, the weather in Zurich is not so nice, but Jenny did a very good job landing under these conditions. For us, it was a great flight, just the way we like it. No stress, everything went well, no technical problems. Just as it should be! Thanks for joining us, I hope you enjoyed yourselves. Maybe we'll see each other again, I can just say: "Hey, dude, watch that wicked flight!" "A badass ride..." - "A badass ride over the Atlantic!" And for your information, that was a very bad landing. We were very pleased with the landing. Even as copilot, he has always been great at flying So you've known each other for a while? - Yeah! Is he taping already? - Yes, he is. To have everything in the can, even if you have a fit of spontaneity. My fits of spontaneity... He will put them in the outtakes! - You bet! Join us on the airway... To the flight training school... cut it, I wanted to say something different! I'll never be TV-compatible! - You already are! First of all, I'm looking forward to our flight... no, that's wrong again! I'm already exhausted! Join us, it's going to be awesome! Good enough? Yay! - Yay! Is that really necessary? I always wanted to do that! - They're rolling! I'm powdering my boss, that's cool! The nose as well. No! And now it's my turn. - Do you have a towel for me? The nose? Over here and a bit there..
