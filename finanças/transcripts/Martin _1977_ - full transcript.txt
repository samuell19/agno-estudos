Let's just watch the game here. Cuda will like that. Come on. What about me? I promised him. He's been bugging me for all this time. He says, "you never spend any time around here." I think he think we're off someplace...you know. What about me? You don't seem to ever Want to spend any time with me anymore. We spend our lives in bed! We do not. That's not the way it is, and you know that. Just relax. Can't you just relax here? No, I can't relax here. I'll just watch, like, the first half with him. I'm so sick of you, This whole place, everyone here. All you want to do is sit down And watch the games And just let everything just pass by. We have to get in the car, And we have to drive all the way out there. It's even more exhausting. Oh, come on. Give me a break! Just forget it. Nosferatu. Oh, you must be Martin. Just a minute, son. I'll get my purse. Go around to the side. Go around to the side. This is for the meat. And this is for you, Martin. Ok? Well, that was quick. I didn't expect you till later this afternoon. It's good that you caught me. I was just gonna run down to the state store. Thank you. I can give you A ride back downtown if you'd like. Why not? It's such a long way. Let's go. This is really something... Coming all the way up here to deliver this stuff. Now I deliver you all the way back downtown. I could have picked it up myself. It's too bad you had to walk all the way up. Have you got a minute? I need gas. can I help you? Woyes. A dollar's worth of regular, please. My husband puts in all the mileage When he's out gallivanting around with the girls. So i'm not gonna use my money To fill up the tank for him. I don't get enough as it is. Yeah, I know you have to get back. It'll just be a minute. Would you reach over there in the glove compartment And give me the little notebook that's in there. In the glove compartment. There's a little notebook in there. Thanks. My husband's a fanatic about this... How much gas, when, what's the mileage. I'm sorry. I'm the complaining old housewife. If you don't like it, get out. Hey, I don't mean you. I mean me. If i'm so dissatisfied, I should just get out of it And shut up about it. You remind me of an old cat I used to have. I don't mean that to sound funny. I had an old alley cat, And he used to sit on the floor And stare up at me with those eyes. I really used to be able To talk to that old cat. And he'd just listen and listen Till I got it all out of my system. He never said anything either, Never talked back. Wow. Thank you. Say, do you do any other jobs... Yardwork, handy-Work, stuff like that? Well, maybe we can work something out. See you next week. Christina: it's crazy. I can't believe this is happening. It's a nightmare, for you and him! Your father was not from our part of the world. Your mother knew. She believed. Well, if she did, then thank god I was too little to know her. Martin had his father until he was 32. Grandfather, he is just a boy! Look in the books, christina. We have the books of the family. Did you ever look? Of course, the books. The books will show it. Those damn books... They should be burned! That's where you get your horrible ideas! Ask the boy himself. Ask Martin. He will tell you. He's unbalanced. He's mad. And you and those books have driven him to it! He is nosferatu. He was born to elena borassa And rudy mathias in the old country In 1892. He is young for nosferatu. There have been 9 such accursed in the family. There are 3 still alive. Martin is one. Count demodeli is the eldest in the family now. From the old country, he sends the letters Telling who will take the company into their house. We obey, first for the family shame, And again because, to defy the evil ones Is to bring a curse upon oneself. I will not shame the family, But the devil... the devil can take my soul. I would have destroyed the children The moment they showed the signs. Elena borassa took her own life instead. Now...Martin comes to me. People cannot come to other people's beliefs. It's hard for you, I know. It's hard for anyone young. Do you believe that god's whole world Runs by the laws of the few sciences We have been able to discover? Oh, no, christina. There is more. But people are satisfied. They know so much, they think they know all. And that makes it easy for nosferatu. That makes it easy for all the devils. Damn him. Here. Let me help. No. It's my job. I just want to help, all right? No. It's my job. Mind if I turn this off? I'm glad you don't believe in the magic. Well, I don't. I really don't. I know, and i'm glad. I'm sorry that you have to go through it all. I know it must be awful for you. It is. It is awful. Tada cuda. Ah, he's... As long as it doesn't get crazy. Sometimes they get crazy. How old are you, Martin? Oh, i'm old. How old? 84. Listen, I would really like to help you. Would you like to see a doctor? I've seen lots of doctors. They don't know what to do either. You shouldn't be with the family. Maybe you should be In a hospital or a home or something. No. That would be too hard for me. Well, I think that this is hard for you, And I think that if the family Really wanted to help you, That that's what they should do. They're crazy! They're the ones that are... I'm sorry. Ah, it's just that... well, I grew up in this entire thing, too. Nosferatu. Nosferatu. The family curse. The family shame. It's the middle ages! Do you know, i heard about this My entire life? Sometimes I even start thinking That i'm gonna believe all that bullshit. I couldn't go to a hospital. That would be too hard for me. I'll be fine. I'm always fine. Damn him. Listen... i really want to talk to you Some more about this, ok? No, I mean I really want to talk to you, And maybe even we can sit grandfather down And talk to him. I'll talk to you, not to him. All right. That's all right. Sure you don't want me to help? Well, i'm gonna go wait out on the back porch. If arthur comes, i'm gonna go ahead and leave. See you later. I'd like to have a phone. I would really like to have a phone. How about that game on sunday, man? It was pretty close. It could have gone either way. We put your phones in upstairs And left the phone books up there for you. Thank you. Christina, shouting: what do you think I am? What do you think I am? Oh, i'm so sick of you! I'm so sick of your attitude towards me! I'm important, and i'm tired... I'm tired of waiting on that damn porch! Don't give me that. I don't want to hear you say that! I don't care where you were this time. Where were you last week? Where were you the week before that? Do you think i don't hear things? I don't ever ask you, now, do i? Do I ever accuse you of anything? I know what you're doing! I don't care. I don't care! A man and a woman dancing. This is a man and a lady in bed? Yeah. It's only $4.98. I sell a lot of them. T.J. Is here, you know. Let me put your bags in your car for you. I don't want no money. I just want to help you, baby. That's all I want. snowcone? Wosnowcone? Oh, no snowcone. How about a fudgicle? I think we're gonna be A few minutes making up our minds. Maybe you better take care of this man. Do you have ice cream sandwiches? A sandwich? One? Hello. who is it, honey? Oh, jesus. Do you have anything? Uh...do you have anything? I only give to organized charities.

Voice: nosferatu. Martin's voice: it gets crazy sometimes, And sometimes I think they're really gonna catch me And hurt me or even kill me. Man's voice: yeah, i've seen that in the movies... People trying to stop your kind. Martin's voice: you have to really stay calm When that happens. And you just have to remember that the ones that are after you Are never calm. People are never calm when they're angry. Man's voice: no, it's true. It's very true. Martin's voice: for a long time, I didn't care if they'd kill me. Most people spend their lives worrying about dying. For a long time, i wished I would die, Or I wished somebody would kill me. It's been a long time for me... a long time full of crazy people. I'm pretty careful about not getting caught now. I've learned a lot of things. I have good tools. And I have the needles. Man's voice: needles? Martin's voice: it was really hard before the needles. Man's voice: what kind of needles? Count? Martin's voice: everything's been pretty easy Since i've learned how to be careful. People are the hardest thing. Man's voice: ha ha ha. I understand. When I see people together, they don't talk, not really. They don't say what they mean. Man's voice: right. Martin's voice: then they have the other, They have the sexy stuff, Whenever they want it. I've been much too shy to ever do the sexy stuff. Man's voice: mm-Hmm... Martin's voice: I mean, do it with someone who was awake. Man's voice: uh...ha ha. Martin's voice: someday maybe i'll get to do it... awake, without the blood part. Just do it with somebody and then be together And talk all night. Man's voice: we've had questions from our listeners As to how often this happens. I mean, every full moon? Martin: I don't know. I lose track. Not all the time. That's not like in the movies either. I saw a movie once where it happened every night. Now, that's crazy. Those movies are crazy. oh, so you mean to tell me, All those movies aren't true, huh? What else isn't true? Are you gonna dispel any other myths, Like getting back to your grave before sunup Or garlic... Martin: it's all crazy. so you don't burn up to a crisp in the sunlight? Nothing like that? Martin: well, the sun bothers my eyes sometimes, Especially when it's about time, when I get shaky. yeah, well, listen, count, my sponsor's getting shaky, So i've got to take a break. Hang on a minute. Night-Timers, we've been talking to the count. Yes, a real, live, honest-To-Goodness vampire. And if you have any questions You'd like to pass on to the count, How about giving me a call here at 555-1650? Be back in a moment. Man's voice on radio: be back in a moment. Talk about a sale. This week's sale at mason's... Accent storage tables, some of our best-Selling... count, are you there? Hey, count? Count? Count, are you there, man? Martin: hello. say, man, where can i get ahold of you? This is really going over big. I mean, it's very good. We have a lot of people calling, and they're very interested. Count, i'd like to talk to you. I'd like to have you come down to the station... Man's voice on radio: ...a 54 by 20 by 16 now $66. You stay in my house. Will you embarrass me like this? This is a catholic family. I will not be seen in church without you. Get dressed. Priest: and jesus answered them, "Have not I chosen you 12, and one of you be the devil..." So ends the gospel according to saint john. Instead of a sermon today, i think that we need to discuss The problem of rebuilding the church. Being new to the community, i've asked deacon roy To talk to you about this. We need a good bit of money If we hope to rebuild this parish. Deacon roy, if you would address the congregation. Deacon roy: thank you. First of all, The tragedy of our church being burned down, I understand, has shaken some of our parishioners' faith. This need not be. Now is the time to express your faith. For example, if we go to our homes when we leave here And see things that we do not use laying around That we can sell, That's one way to raise money. Hold raffles. And we can all get together and furnish labor. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Will you come up to the house sometime? Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. We will have supper late tomorrow night. I invited the new priest To come to our house for supper. You will make a good dinner. Sure you wouldn't like something in that? You don't mind if I do, right? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. It's just that you're... So gentle, So nice. I only want to hold you. Martin, don't be so afraid. The door is finished. Father curry was in braddock...42... No, 43 years before he left. No. Thank you. I'd like to have a little more wine. You like this wine? Gorinzkas made this wine. I like it, too. Gorinzkas. I don't know him. Is he catholic? A good catholic, yes, father howard. But you wouldn't know him. He left even before corelli. That's too bad. I would have commissioned him To make some wine for the church. I don't suppose it's sacrilege to say That the wine at st. Vincent's is putrid. You were sent here, or you asked to come? I was sent by the diocese When father corelli retired. Retired? Ha! Father corelli is younger than I am. He asked to leave. He left, like the rest of them. They think this town is finished. No. He has cancer. He's very near the end. In fact, i haven't heard. He may be gone. Oh, thank you. This is a town for old persons, father howard. You know the things an old person Wants from a priest? Oh, this is very sweet. An old person needs a priest Who thinks the way the old person thinks, A priest who believes in the old ways. That's why I use the latin mass here in braddock. I think people around here... Do you believe in demons, father howard? Do you believe the devil can enter a person's soul? I don't know what to believe about that. You don't know, father howard? Ha! You see, this is what I mean. This is not what an old person Wants to hear from a priest. Father howard, would you like some more cookies? No, thanks. Can I get you anything else? No, no. I'm fine. If our priests cannot save us from such things, Who can, father howard? Well, i've had several conversations about this With some of my associates, And I think... i think it's a difficult issue. It's something that has to be dealt with. Grandfather, stop it. You're gonna scare father howard away. Fascinating subject, actually. You should talk to father zulemas about this. Father... zulemas. Zulemas. He a great old guy. He claims to have actually done The old mystical rites for real. He went to see that film the exorcist. He said they did it all wrong. Zulemas. I don't suppose you saw that movie. I thought it was great. Woman's voice: Martin. Martin. nosferatu. I cast you out... Unclean spirit, Along with every satanic power of the enemy, Every sector from hell, And all your felled companions, In the name of our lord jesus christ. It is he who commands you. Harken therefore, and tremble in fear, satan, You enemy of the faith, You foe of the human race, You begetter of death, You robber of life, You corrupter of justice, You root of all evil and vice, Seducer of men, Betrayer of the nations... ...fountain of avarice, fomenter of discord, Author of pain and sorrow. Why, then, do you stand and resist, knowing... that christ our lord brings your plans to nothing? By the sign of the holy cross of our lord jesus christ, Who lives and reigns With the father and the holy spirit, God and forever... o amen. Amen. The lord be with you all. May he also be with you. May he also be with you. Let us pray. Look down in pity on this, your servant, Martin, Now in the toils of the unclean spirit, Now caught up in the fearsome threats Of man's ancient enemy, Sworn foe of our race... By the sign of the cross... Keep watch over the innermost recesses of his heart. Whoo! Ha ha ha! Devil. You are the devil. You devil, you. It's just a costume. It's only a costume. Wait just a minute. I'll get some money. How about a little painting tomorrow? Joey's out of town again, And he left the game room half finished. You want me here for sex, don't you? I never really did it before. I was always too shy. But I decided... i'd really like to do it with you. I'm all dressed now. Why are you crying? Why are you crying? It's nothing. Did I hurt you? What did I do? You didn't do anything, Martin. You're worrying about having a kid. I knew I should have worn One of those things. Oh, jesus, Martin. It's nothing to do with you. Really? Really. Worrying about having a kid. Ha ha. I can't have kids. I can never have kids. There's something wrong inside. I don't know. What do you think? Is that good for me or bad for me? No opinion? That's why you're so nice to have around, Martin. You don't have opinions. You took it down. What? You took it down. Oh, I thought it was stupid, A stupid superstition. I just didn't want it there, that's all. I was right, wasn't i? Hurry and come down to supper. I'm going out tonight. Woget the goddamn stogie out of your mouth And don't burn me up. I'll try not to. Don't try to burn me up. Nope. I've just got to get out of here, that's all. I say go to all of you. If you don't want to be here, Then we don't need you! I want to be here. I've been here since I was a kid. Hey, but i'm a good mechanic. I should be fixing cars. What am I doing here? Go...like william korinzkas, Like molinopzkus. It's good for christina not to be married yet. She's young for her years. Maybe it's good for her never to marry. You know, we have a problem... in the family. What? You've seen the boy Martin. Yeah. Oh, it is a problem. It is the shame of us parents. You want to have children, don't you? Yeah. Think about it. Just think about it. You're still here. I guess... i guess he, uh... couldn't come. I guess, uh... i don't like arthur. He makes you feel bad. Oh, Martin, it isn't arthur. It's...i don't expect any more from arthur. It's... it's everything. It's... it's everything. Arthur told me about The conversation you had with him. It's such bullshit, grandfather. It is so goddamn hypocritical. There is insanity in this family, And you've got it! You will not use such language in my house. Language? Shit on the language! Well, good-Bye, grandfather cuda. Where will you go? I leave tomorrow morning with arthur. Oh, but don't worry. We won't have any offspring. We won't even wind up together. Arthur's just my way out. Christina... you are wrong. Well, then, too bad for me. Christina: if you need anything, You just call me or... Or come. I'll send you the money. No. You'll forget about me. No, I won't. Why do you think i'll forget? Because you're going away. People always go away So they can forget where they were. Well, I won't. You'll see. I won't forget. I'll tell you where I am. Martin... will you finish your breakfast? I wish you could shoot me up with drugs, Take away a piece of my brain or something. Boy, do I wish what you have is catching. Some people think it is catching. In the movies, it's catching. Give it to me. Please. Martin, you're lazy! You're a lazy boy! Cuda, you make him work! We work hard around here! Martin's voice: there's a lot of people I could do it to if I wanted. Man's voice: ooh, stay away from your old friend barry. Martin's voice: I know a lot of people. I know what they do. I've watched them a lot, and I know what they do. I've been letting them go, Even the ones who are really mean to me all the time. I just decided to let them go. So I don't know what i'm gonna do. I'm getting pretty shaky. I'm really getting shaky. Can I bring your buggy back? You ain't got to pay no cash. I don't want no money. And when I try to find somebody to do it to, I can't decide. It's like...none of the ladies look pretty. I don't know. I used to be able to decide fast. I used to be able to find somebody really fast... The ladies looked pretty or something. Please. Leave her alone! Man, what you doing? Martin's voice: maybe it's just because I'm doing the sexy stuff without the blood now, Doing it with an awake person. I don't know. He looks really good in his tennis shoes, doesn't he? hey, that's where that loony lives, man. Hey, give me that beer can, will you? I can hit that loony with this beer can. Come on. Give me a beer can. Whoo! Hey! How about a beer? Give me a beer. You know, you didn't have to like All of that attention that he was giving you. What can I say? Beggars can't be choosers. Yeah? Well, you can beg and choose me, Can't you? Sure can. Martin's voice: i've got to do something. I've got to pick somebody. I'm getting so shaky, i might make a mistake. Barry's voice: a mistake?
