The world we see every day, is it truly a real world? The human brain controls what we see subconsciously... ...and deletes some information. But the machine doesn't lie. If you look up, you will notice an unbelievable number of cameras. It is believed that more than four million cameras are operating in Japan. And tens of millions of hours' worth of videos are being recorded every day. But do they really capture the same world we see? Sometimes, they will witness the world of death. And the strange incident in it may be a sign of a grudge... or regret of the dead... trying to tell us the truth. "Warning" "The videos you are about to see may contain paranormal activies..." "related to the dead." "We are not responsible for any tragedies or illnesses..." "caused by watching these videos." "Please be advised." "Traffic Intersection" The Shibuya intersection. There is no other place where so many people cross at the same time. And there are so many cameras watching this intersection. And sometimes, something that is out of the ordinary... can be captured on video. This video was captured from the building... right next to the intersection. This specific location has always had some issues with the camera. They no longer have a camera at this location. "Please listen carefully right before the video gets jammed. "Please just listen to the audio." "Were you able to hear someone reading the sutras?" "After a careful analysis we spotted a mysterious woman." "Please focus on the center of the screen." The woman in a mourning dress suddenly appears, then disappears. Who is she? If you look carefully... she seems to be carrying a portrait of a deceased person. "How can you tell if a person you just saw is a real person_" "Taxi" Lately, to avoid trouble with passengers and to review accidents... many taxi companies are installing dashcams in their cars. The video you are about to see... was captured by one of those cameras. First, let's hear from the taxi driver who provided this video. I think it was about three months ago. I was right in the middle of my shift. I didn't have any luck with passengers. It was totally dead that day. But I guess it was around 1am. You can expect some long distance passengers in Ginza around that time. So I was driving my car from Yotsuya to Ginza. I was keeping the volume of the radio very low. When I came around this area I heard the loud noise through my radio. That caught me by surprise. I wasn't sure what it was, but I just kept going. Then I saw a woman in a white coat standing over there. I figured she may be waiting for a cab. I tried to stop my car, but I passed her a little. Then I turned back. And she was gone. Where was it? It was right before that signal, which is green right now. Is it where that black car is parked? Yes, a little bit further. "Nagata, Tokyo" This is the actual video of the moment captured by the dashcam. "You can clearly hear the radio noise." Just like the driver said... you can see a woman in a white coat standing there. "Now please watch the videos from both the front and back." As the noise from the radio disappears... you see a woman on the side of the street. The driver got out of the car to check... but he didn't see a woman anymore. Please watch when a woman in a white coat shows up. You can see a woman on the left side. As the driver notices her, he pulls the car over. Based on the speed of the car and the woman's position... it is rather strange that the back camera didn't capture her there. And was it really a white coat she was wearing? It almost looks like a bathrobe from a hotel somewhere. "Please listen to the radio noise right before she appears." "Can you hear the siren?" I just remembered right then. I believe it was right around here. There was a huge fire that killed many people about 30 years ago. According to the other drivers who have been around much longer... you have a great chance of running into them around here. I didn't take it seriously, but it came to mind. I couldn't sleep that night. "As the driver said..." "this was the location of the famous fire." "Many were killed in the high-rise hotel fire." "Bar" "Kabuki-cho, Tokyo" This video was captured inside the bar where the incident happened. Two cameras have captured the entire incident. We acquired the video from the source. But it captured something very strange. A small reunion party was being held. The man sitting on the left had a birthday that day. So they decided to meet up at the bar... they used to visit regularly. The woman at the bar... suggested to take a photo of the two together. And she held up her camera. Say cheese! - Huh? - I closed my eyes! - Oh, yeah, you did! - Okay, one more time! Say cheese! - How is it? - This one's good! Now the girls swap places and take a photo with the man. Okay, say cheese! Oh, it came out really good! - Can you take it with my phone? - Your phone? Sure! - There you go. - Okay. - Hey, are you okay? - Wait, we're taking a picture. "The barkeeper kept hitting the man like he was crazy." "We were able to talk to one of the women." The barkeeper kept hitting him. I have no idea what happened. We called the police after it happened. But we ran out of there quickly. And... well... Someone passing by came to our help. He instructed us to call the police and we returned to the bar. But he was still hitting him. He's been in a koma ever since. He hasn't woken up yet. We hadn't been there for a while. We frequented that bar when we were in college. The barkeeper was always smiling and very kind. We didn't expect him to act like that. It was totally out of character. "Please watch it from a different angle." This video captured the strange movement by the barkeeper. Ready? Say cheese! - I closed my eyes! - Oh, really! - Yeah, you closed your eyes! - I know! One more time! Say cheese! - How was it? - It came out really nice. Please focus on the barkeeper's movement. Okay, say cheese! - Oh, it came out really good! - Yeah? - Can you take it with my phone? - Your phone? Sure. - There it is. - Okay. "Please focus on the barkeeper's head movement." Okay, say cheese! - Oh, it came out really good! - Yeah? "Did you notice him staring at the wall in the back?" "Please watch it with split screen." - Are you ready? - Yeah! Okay, say cheese! Please focus on the mirror... on the left side of the video on the right. A woman can be seen for a second when the flash goes off. Who is she? There was him, the birthday boy, the girl who planned the party, myself... and Mami was supposed to join us later. And the barkeeper. That's all. He was living freely. He didn't have a steady job, just working part-time. He was really friendly, so a lot of girls liked him. So he was kind of like a leech sometimes... How should I say it? So some women might have had a grudge against him. But not the barkeeper, I don't think... We knew him very well, so we understood how he was. We would've never dated him or anything like that. The woman who only appeared when the flash went off... What did she say to the barkeeper? "We still don't know who this woman is." "Trash Heap" This video was captured at the residential dumpsite in Nagoya. They had behavior issues with some of the residents. So several neighbors chipped in to set up this security camera. But instead, it captured something terrifying. It was between 7 and 8 in the morning. You see the residents dropping off the trash every few minutes. Please watch this woman's movement very carefully. A woman from earlier brought a man with her. She tells him to move some of the trash, and he reluctantly follows her request. "What did the woman witness..." They didn't find anything after all. And they returned to their home. Please watch when she drops off the trash. It seems like she froze for a moment after spotting something. And she runs away quickly. Please watch right below her right hand very carefully. Did you notice? Right after she puts the trash down, you can see something moving. She said that she saw a woman's hand... move between those bags. We carefully reviewed the video right before and after this moment. We didn't see anyone go in or out of the trash pile. "A messenger from the other side may appear in unexpected places." "Elevator" This video was captured in front of the elevator... in an apartment building. A woman jumped to her death... about two years ago at this location. Since then, her ghost has been seen in the building many times. You can see the shadow of someone behind the man who just stepped out. It seems like a woman. But when the elevator arrives on the second floor, it's gone. "A female shadow disapparead suddenly." We decided to investigate this apartment building. Based on the information we got from the manager of this building... when investigating about the woman who died two years ago... we were able to get in touch with and talk to one of her friends. I've known her since we attended beauty school together. We often went out to eat and just hanged around together. When did she pass away? The end of the year, two years ago. On the day she passed away, did you go to her apartment? Yes, I did. I received a call from my friend, so I rushed over there. But she was already transported to a hospital. But her blood was still all over the place. She was dating someone at the time. And they weren't getting along. I guess he was cheating on her a lot. But she really loved him. So she was desperate to make him turn around, I think. She was a hard worker. She was thinking of studying in New York. But she couldn't go. According to her, she wanted to be a beautician more than anyone else. She still can't understand why she decided to end her life. "Please watch the video from inside the elevator." Please watch the video on the bottom right. This video was captured at the same time... when a woman's shadow showed up. When the businessman gets in... we don't see a woman's shadow yet. The elevator passes the third floor, then the second floor. And it reaches the first floor. "A female shadow can't be seen inside the elevator." She was a hard worker. She was thinking of studying in New York. But she couldn't go. "Her boyfriend disappeared after her death." "Her death was surrounded by many suspicious circumstances." "Many still doubt that she committed suicide." "Underground Walkway" This video was captured in the underpass in Tachikawa, Tokyo. Sexual predators have been spotted in this area... so three cameras have been set up at the entrance, exit, and in the middle. It's after 1am. It's very busy during the day... but you rarely see anyone around this time. A strange phenomenon has been captured right after this. Please focus on the video labeled "02", which was set up in the middle. It captured something unthinkable in our daily life. Did you spot it? You can see a shadow moving... from the front to the back of the video. You can't project this type of narrow shadow... unless you walk right by the wall. We decided to investigate the location to find out more about the shadow. It was unusually cold inside the underpass. But we didn't find anything unusual... about the camera that captured the shadow. The underpass is about 3m wide. And it's impossible to set up something to cast a shadow on the wall. But the sight outside caught us by surprise. "There was a cemetery right next to the underpass." "This was part of the cemetery before the underpass was built." "Laundromat" This video was captured three years ago inside a coin laundry in Tokyo. Please watch the entire screen very carefully. Did you notice it? The white dryer on the right moves slowly... every time someone passes. After the owner closes the store... the same dryer starts moving rapidly on its own. What's more, when the headlights of a passing car... shine through the store... the video captures something else unusual. Right next to the spinning dryer... you can see the shadow of a woman with long hair. Who is she? Actually, at this coin laundry... a newborn baby was found dead inside the dryer... about ten years ago. Since then... the dryer started spinning on its own at night... and a female ghost was often spotted. "The store is now gone and has been turned into a parking lot." "Shop" This video was captured inside a store in Itabashi-ku, Tokyo. A paranormal activity was caught in this video. Please watch it very carefully. In this store, a door suddenly opens. And things fall off the shelves on their own. So called poltergeist phenomenon can be seen time to time. "We were able to interview the store owner." It was back in 2008, I think. There was a traffic accident in front of the store. One of my regulars was the mother of a kindergartner. While she was shopping inside my store... her daughter jumped out in the street and was hit by a truck. She was hospitalized for a month. And sadly, she passed away. Soon after that... things started to fall off the shelves. Maybe once or twice a month, when nobody is around. Like an instant noodle or a soda can, here and there. It's been going on for three years. Has her mother come here after the accident? Of course, she came here to get a cigarette or a drink. She came to shop sometimes. But I haven't seen her since the third anniversary. The kindergarten graduation was around March 20th. I think it was around that time. I believe it's one way for her... to express her love to her daughter... or something like that. Did you notice? There was a bouquet... placed on the side of the road. Until the third anniversary last year, her mother placed flowers there every month. But she had a new baby... and stopped coming to the location. "When we visited the location, there were no flowers." "We analyzed the video even further." "Then..." We noticed something... other than a little girl's poltergeist phenomenon... in this video footage. "We hope the little girl's spirit is resting in peace." "Railroad Crossing" This video was captured by a security camera... at the railroad crossing. This crossing is being called... "the devil's crossing" by people living in the area... because there have been so many suicides... at this location. It's after 10pm. You still see some traffic because it's near a shopping area. Please keep watching the video. Please focus on the windows... of the passing train on the left-hand side. If you watch carefully... you may be able to see someone's face. Is it a soul of someone who died at this crossing? It seems like it's looking this way... in agonizing pain. "We noticed something else after reviewing the video." Please pay attention to the man... who's walking towards the camera. Do you sense something unusual about him? Then the train with the strange face... will come speeding by. "Did you notice that the same man walked by twice?" This is the man before the train passes by. Just a minute after that... the same man appears from the same direction. Did you notice the difference between him and the others? "The man has no shadow." "We found out that it takes at least 3 and a half mintues to go around." "Every year, people commit suicide at this crossing." "He may be one of the victims who died at this location." The cameras are always watching us without our knowledge. There are more than four million cameras in Japan alone. And they record tens of millions of hours worth of videos every day. The mysterious videos we showed you today are... only a fraction of what's out there right now. We created the surveillance cameras to capture people. But what's being recorded may not look like it's from this world. Maybe it's actually recording the real world.
