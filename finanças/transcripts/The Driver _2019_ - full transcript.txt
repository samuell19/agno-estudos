[man narrating] I need to sleep. I can't remember the last time I got a good night's sleep. But no one has slept much these last years. Not with them out there. People aren't any better. It almost seems the dead went after the good people and left us with assholes. My partner here is a prime example. [pounding] He's awake. Doesn't matter. What did Tony do anyways? He didn't tell me and I didn't ask. I knew what Tony had done. But my partner, Joe, wasn't in the loop. He was just a soldier, one of the few handy with a gun. When someone had to go, we took care of it. Tony was a thief. He stole water from the community, using it to make moonshine in secret. "Secret" didn't sit well with the leaders. He knew the price. Time to pay up. I like Tony. He wasn't a dick. He was a thief, but he wasn't a dick. We're here. [tires squeal] Get out. Listen, Tony, we're going to take off that gag. Are you going to be quiet? - Man, please! You gotta let me... - [exclaims] - I'm sorry. - [driver] Pick him up. Listen, Tony. I like you. I'll give you a choice. You can run, take your chances with them, or take a bullet. - What? - Have your freedom... or end up dinner for them. I'll take my chances. I'll run. Huh. Stay still. [car door shuts] - [engine starts] - Good luck. - [gunfire] - [shouts] Stop! Take me! Come back! [growling, snarling] [Tony screams] [lighter clicks] I always like when we give them a choice. [narrator] A choice? That was no choice. Just a game Joe liked to play. He told me once in his old life he did it to a guy, a gambler, owed his boss too much money. Except it was crocodiles. A swamp. Get to the other side, freedom. Debt cleared. No one ever saw him again. Like I said, an asshole. Fucker doesn't even know how to smoke. [clicks, radio static] [man] Ladies and gentlemen, it's that time of day again. Get ready for all your favorite sounds of civilization. - [snarling] - But first... - [continues, indistinct] - [chuckles] That guy always cracks me up. Yeah. He's a real hoot. [anthem plays on PA] [zombies snarling] [roaring, snarling] [anthem continues playing] No one ever said they were smart. It's primeval. What? Built-in instinct. [narrator] Smart or not, they were fast. And deadly. One bite, and you were dead. Some people died fast, under 12 hours. Others lasted longer. But none more than a day. A fever was the first sign, and then sluggishness, stumbling, a craving for water, then death. And then pretty soon after, they wake. The noise drew them away each night so we could have some sort of life. In the day, you hunkered down, made as little noise as possible. Still, many came. The smallest noise drew them out like flies. Not smells or sights. Noise. No one knew why. Gonna drive it back to the garage? No. [speaking foreign language] Good. Stay alert. [generator humming] Hey, boss, what's the status? All four generators purring like a kitten. Fuel? About enough to last us another six months. Good. Keep us running. Will do. In this world, in a place like this, everything has to function. The guards better be awake. The generators better be functional. Power, water and food... the same three essentials from before still apply. - Just more difficult to come by. - [engine starts] You can take nothing for granted. The dead were easy to keep out. It's the living that I fear the most. [groans] [exhales] [indistinct conversations] [children exclaiming] [narrator] Outside of my wife and daughter, only two people I know I can trust here. Lee is one of them. He was already here when we arrived. Kept everyone alive by himself. Back then, there was only a handful of them. It's grown tenfold since. Too many, if you ask me. Anything? All good here? What about you? Fine. Really? Really. What about you? Fine. DJ is the other guy. [driver] DJ! He's like a cockroach, but in a good way. A pet cockroach. The man could survive anything. Instantly likable, and with a heart of gold. Ever since he got here, he set up our communication system. I'm still debating whether that's a good thing or not. Thanks anyway. So, um, was Tony... yeah? Yeah. Stealing again? Three strikes, you're out. That's so stupid. People liked him too. Could be trouble. I know. But rules are rules, and we all know that. Sure do. When is it ready? Uh, soon. You rush these things, and they blow up in your face. So, uh... Yeah. We have to know whether it's true or not. They won't believe us unless we have comms with him. We believe. You still broadcasting on shortwave? Yeah. Every day. Late nights, afternoons, spreading the good word. Good. Keep it up. - Just might save someone's life. - I hope so. I just wish I knew if anybody was listening. I'm sure someone is. I still wish we could tell them where we are. We can't. More people, more trouble. Yeah, I hear you. - Hey. - Hey. Let me guess. - Comm's still not working? - Let me check. Uh... He's waiting for you. - You be cool. - Always. You guys say hi to that Dr. Strange wannabe upstairs, huh? [chattering] Children, it's almost time for dinner. Now, go wash up. [woman] You heard the man. Come along, or there won't be any dinner. Come on. Let's go. Thank you, Mary. Make sure we're not disturbed. Mary. So how was it? He ran. - Damn fool. - Yeah. Let's keep that between us. People liked that boy. I know. What's done is done. May the good Lord look on him with favor when he reaches heaven. Amen. We need to talk. Not that again. DJ will have the comms up soon. When he does... if he does... we will try our best to reach out to them, anyone who is out there. And then what? We have two vehicles, one of which isn't working very well. You want to tell these folks they've got to stay behind? No, sir. I say we stay, like I've always been saying. We have food, water, safety. We can't last. Those things will never get in here. They're not the only things out there. Others! Our kind has gotten more ruthless! And that is why I have you. Come, let's enjoy this time we have. Go see your family and meet us at the table. Thank you. But I think I'll eat at home. As you wish. And don't let them get to you. You and I both know that what you do, what I do, keeps this place from falling into anarchy. Now, go see your wife and that little girl of yours. Not so little anymore. Time does fly. Let's just hope we can make it last long enough for our children to have a peaceful world once more. That's the only thing I pray for. You pray? Only for that. [narrator] Religion went to shit long before the world did. The way it was practiced especially. But I believe in faith. In hope. Without hope... what point humanity? Animal! You're an animal! He was my son! My only son! My one son! [sobs] [woman] Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. [woman sobbing] [sighs] Fuck her and her idiot son. Don't you like it? Not that much. Thank you. - Do you have something? - Not yet. Go. Are you drawing Fred again? It's for Henry. He never saw a dog before. Not a real one, I mean. I told him about having Fred when I was little, and he wanted to see what he looked like. Well, it's really good. Thanks. - So how's the painting of your father coming? - It's almost finished. But he hardly has time to sit for me anymore. He's a busy man. All right, time for dinner. Clear all that up. Hey, why don't we sit with everyone else like we used to? Honey, Dad thinks it's important we have some time, just us, as a family. But I thought everyone here was a family. One big family. That's what everyone says. It's what Gabriel says, and my teachers. We are an extended family, but... it's nice to have time just us too, you know? - Okay. - Okay. Put it away. Knock, knock. Dad! Hey, honey. - How are you? - Good. Good. Hey. [sighs] Wash up. [no audible dialogue] All right, babe, it's time for you to finish your schoolwork. Okay. The painting's almost done. Right. Uh, let me talk with Mom for five minutes, and I will sit for you. Okay, great. Okay, what's wrong? You and Joe weren't out looking for food or gas today, were you? No. Was it Tony? Seems like you already know. [sighs] People were giving me dirty looks all day. He was a thief. I know. They know. But he was human. How many of us are left? There'd be a lot fewer if we didn't stop people like him. But he was so young. And people liked him. And now they hate you, and they hate me and Bree by extension. Well, then, it's time to leave. How? Where? The car is already loaded. Water, food, guns. We head up north, where the man said it was. Haven. That is a story you heard from a dying man on the side of a road. A stranger. Bree is 12. She can believe in unicorns. I believe it. You're the only one. - DJ does. - DJ doesn't count. - DJ wasn't here in the beginning. - Neither was I. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [mouths words] Come here. Uh, hey, Dad? Oh. Sorry. You, young lady, have impeccable timing. Well, thank you. [mother] Okay. Let's let your dad get some sleep now. Uh, we'll finish tomorrow, okay? - Okay. - Okay. [kisses] - Sleep tight. - And don't let anything bite. Never. - Who? - Me. All clear? Clear. - [groans] - [machine gun fire] Fuck! Get Bree, get your "go" bag. - What? - Get Bree, get your "go" bag. Should I sound the alarm? - Yes, do it. - Okay. [snarling] [klaxon wails] [panicked screaming] This is DJ, last of the old breed, sending the good word to the good people. Haven, come on. We know you're out there. - Let us know, and we'll... Hold on. - [gunfire] Listen very carefully. Our base has been compromised. We're under attack. It is not safe here. Stay away from the old rice mill. Head north. I believe that is where Haven is. Maybe I'll see you there. This is DJ, signing off. [man] Go, go! Get to the bunker! Go! Hurry! - Is there anything I can do? - Go! Get to the bunker! [gunfire] - [gasping, exclaiming] - [grunting] [grunts] Get back! [muffled shouting] [groaning] [growling] - What's happening? - We're under attack. - Who? - I don't know. Your duty remains in this room, protecting me! Bree! Bree, get up! Where's your "go" bag? - What? - Where's your "go" bag? It's up there. Okay, come on, get dressed. - Where's Dad? - He's where he needs to be. Come on. Hurry up! Get inside! Come on! Get inside and lock the door! Go! [gunshot] Get inside! Go! [shouting] [growling, snarling] [shouts] [slurping] [whispering, indistinct] Joe! Thank God. You traitor. Where's your God now? [gasping] No, no. No, no. Please, please, please. I'll come back for you later. It's Sharon and Bree! Open the door! Open the door, goddamn it! Okay, baby, it's gonna be all right. Let's get back to the house, okay? [snarling] [Joe screaming] [groans] Why? Why? Because you never let me drive! [body thuds] [zombies snarling] [grunting] [roars] [snarling] [groaning] [grunting] [roaring] [grunts] [chain rattling] Run, Bree! Run! Bree? [exclaims] [panting] [roars] Mom! Sharon? Mama! No, please, God! We have to stop the bleeding. I have bandages. It's too late. - No, Dad. We have to try. - Bree... It's too late. Even if we stopped the bleeding, she'll turn. [sighs] - Please? - [Sharon coughing] Don't let her turn. [coughing continues] [sobbing] [father] I won't. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. You got to let go. Let go, baby. Let go. Good-bye, Mama. I loved you so much. [door shuts] I love you. [gunshot] Right in here. Come on. [narrator] Fucking Joe. Death was too good for him. I should've left him to the dead. But shooting him felt good. And right now, I need to feel good. I used to kill people for a living. Now I kill the dead to live. - There's irony in there somewhere. - [zombie snarling] I don't care what it takes. I have to keep her alive. Haven was a rumor, people said. I didn't think so. A while back, I found a man dying by the side of the road, his car wrecked, his family dead beside him. Trying to get to Haven, he said. Up north. Place of safety. None of those things that used to be people. Doctors, researchers. Army, maybe. Heard it on a radio broadcast. [switches radio on] [radio static] Not close enough, maybe. Maybe it is just a rumor. But right now, it's all we got: hope. [whispers] Hey. Hey. [Bree] How did they get in? Those dead things? Joe. He betrayed us. Joe? I thought he was your friend. Wasn't he? Guess not. Why? I don't understand. Some people have a mean streak in them. He was never really happy. Wanted more, I guess. Thought he could run things. And now he's dead. All those people... our friends, my mother... they're all dead too! Shh! We don't have any walls. We have to be quiet out here. Where are they? Anywhere. Everywhere. What happened? Oh. Bullet must've grazed me. Does it hurt? Nah. Hey. Why don't you go... take care of business? Don't go too far. Make sure I can see you. Daddy? Be very quiet. Faster. [low snarling] As soon as we close the door, they'll hear us. Shh, shh, shh. Her mother was dead. And I would be soon too. I had 12 hours... maybe more, maybe less... to find Haven. To give her a chance to have a life. Now I just had to find the damn place before I checked out. I know one thing: I won't wait to turn. I'll save one bullet for me. - [engine starts] - [snarling] - [father] You hungry? - No. You didn't have breakfast. Not hungry. Maybe some water. Why don't you take a look in the duffel bag. - Can you help me? - Yeah. This food looks really old. Military-grade rations. Dehydrated and vacuum-sealed. You know, it's still edible and not all that bad-tasting. I found them on an army base. It says it's cheese spread. Cheese spread? Ingredients not in regular cheese. Ah. Maybe find something else. - Cookies are good. - [chuckles] [clears throat] Hmm. Cookie. ♪ You got me ♪ ♪ Killer moon ♪ ♪ And I got you ♪ ♪ I got you ♪ ♪ I'm dying ♪ ♪ Under you ♪ Weapons training. What? We're gonna do this in bits and pieces, all right? - Okay. - Take my gun. Finger off the trigger. I don't want you shooting in the car. Nope. Uh-uh. Don't point it at anything you don't want to shoot at. What now? Okay, see that button on the side of the handle? - This one? Okay. - Yes. Press that, the clip will come out. - Yeah. - Good. Put it down. Now check the slide. It's this part right here. Pull it back. What do you see inside? - Nothing. - Good. Put it down. Okay. Slide out those bullets gently. Don't drop them. One, two, three. Yes. I want you to reload. There's a box of ammo in my pack, duffel bag back there. - Okay. - Red-and-black box. Okay. Take out some bullets. Load up the clip like it's... Pez candy. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, it's all filled. Good. Unload it and do it again. Come on. Okay, good. Put the clip down. Pick up the gun. Slide it back. Make sure there's nothing inside. - Nope. - Good. Practice how to aim. Roll down your window. - All right. - Pick a target. The trees, sign, anything. - Okay, I'll do that big tree over there. - All right. - Bam! - Hey, no noise. Just pretend. I mean, that was pretending, but no noise. Okay. Ooh, sign. I got it. - You missed. High and left. - What? How do you know? I used to teach people how to do this. What do you mean? - Never mind. - Tell me. - It's not important. - It is to me. I used to kill people for a living. Can I pull the trigger? Yeah. It's called dry firing. Don't do it too much. Wear out the connection. Two times. Okay. [clicks] - Oh. That's not easy. - Good. Means it's a safe gun. I never thought any gun was totally safe. I suppose not. Keep practicing. Okay. - [clicks] - You missed. - [clicks] - Missed again. - [clicks] - That time, I got it. [pistol cocks, clicks] [cocking, clicking continues] - What's wrong? - I, uh... I just need a second. Okay. Hey. All right, scoot over. Driving lesson. What? Come on. It'll be fun. [exhales, groans] All right. You know, other than you, this is my baby. - I know. - All right. Luckily, this is an automatic. All you have to do is keep your foot on the brake, - Mm-hmm. - and shift out of park into D, drive, or R, reverse. - Yes. Yeah. - Okay? You never step on the gas and brake at the same time. You only use your right foot. Left foot stays to the side. - Okay. - Right foot, gas or brake. - Understood? - Yes. - Okay. - Can I start it? Seat belts. Ah. [exhales, clears throat] Okay, where are we going? North, to Haven. I thought that was a myth. Let's find out. Start it up. Foot on the brake. Brake. - Press the start button. - Okay. - [engine starts] - All right. Shift it from park to D, drive. - Okay. - Foot off the brake, onto the gas. Press slowly. [engine revs] Good. - [brakes screech] - Slow down, slow down. - Hey, watch. - Okay. You drive like your mother. - Is that bad? - No. It's really bad. - Pay attention. - Okay. Are you breathing? - Yeah. - Okay. All right. Keep going. Pay attention. Slow down. Slow down? I know it's not much, but... happy birthday. Dad... my birthday's tomorrow. I know, but... why wait, right? Mom. She's not here. Honey, it's too soon, I know. We will grieve when we get to Haven. I promise. But for now, let's... just be happy we have each other, okay? Okay. Okay. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday Dear Bree ♪ [brakes screech] Scoot over. [sighs] I'm sorry. No worries. You did good. You stopped in time. No damage done. Who were they, anyway? Bandits. Scum. Living off good people. Like the ones that attacked our home. Yes. Never trust them. How are we going to trust the people at Haven? If it's real, they have to trust us. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Why? - You're sweating a lot. It's adrenaline. - Grab me a water? - Sure. Whoa. Your mom said, "Never share open bottles," right? I guess so. That was recent. Bree? Take this. It's loaded. Don't point it at me, don't point it at yourself. I need you to go outside, keep guard, eyes and ears. You see something coming at us, you point and you squeeze hard. - You understand? - Mm-hmm. But I don't think I can do it. I need you to. All right? I'll teach you more about it later. Right now, you point and you squeeze. Got it? Yeah. All right. Take your seat belt off. Once we get outside, you leave the door open, okay? Eyes and ears. All right. [liquid gurgling] [father] Watch! - [low snarling] - [gasps] Daddy! Dad! Shoot it! - Shoot it! - I can't. [gunshot] Get in the car. Get in the car! It's okay. No. It's not. I could've died. You could've died too. Just like Mom. It's your first time. It's okay. I need to learn... how to kill them. I have an idea. One thing the old world never lacked was guns and ammo. I have plenty of both... and little time. I already feel weak, dizzy. She saw the sweat. I can only explain it away so long. Soon we must talk. But not yet. All right, come here. You're gonna start with the rifle. Killing for the first time is easier at a distance. The scope will help you aim. Keep your finger off the trigger until we're ready, all right? - Okay. - If you can, you find high ground and something to stabilize the weapon against. Come on. And don't point that at me. Don't you point that at anything you don't want to shoot. Okay. All right, come over here. You're gonna use this tree to stabilize your gun, all right? You're gonna watch for anything on this side of the hill. - I'm gonna watch our backs, all right? - Yeah. It's a single-shot. That means it shoots one time, and then you've got to reload. - You see that lever right there? - Mm-hmm. Push it out, pull it back. Okay. That's where you put the bullet in. Right? Push it forward. You just reloaded it. Down. You shoot. All right? You pull it back and repeat. - Okay. - Got that? All right. The scope, you're gonna see some crosshairs in there. You line those crosshairs up right between the eyes, right in the middle of the forehead. Squeeze the trigger. Don't pull. And very important... Listen to me. Hey! Listen to me. You squeeze and exhale. You're gonna feel some jolt, all right, a kick, the butt. - Yep. Mm-hmm. - All right? So, nice and stable, strong. Don't put your head too close to the scope. - You know why? - Why? It will hit back and give you an idiot cut. - You don't want that. - Mm-mmm. Any questions? I think I'm good. All right. Take some of these rounds, put them in your pocket where you can get to them easily. Why don't you load one in? - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, finger off the trigger until you're ready to go. They're gonna come from everywhere. You cover everything on that side. I got our backs. All right. [gunshot] [chamber clicks] Daddy! Okay. [shrieks] Good. Bree? Oh. [gunshot] [growling] [gunshot] - [snarling] - [gunshot] [snarling, shouts] [gunshot] - [gunshot] - [roars] [roaring] [gunshot] [gunshot] Watch your six. - [gunshot] - [snarling] [gunshot] [gunshot] - [roaring, snarling] - [gunshot] [gunshots] Get in the car. Get in the car. [groans] [panting] [groans] Get me another water, please. Oh, God. You got bit, didn't you? Stop the car. - Bree... - Now. [sighs] Now, show me. You lied to me. I had to. You knew you were dying this whole time. I had to get you to a safe place. I had to try. A safe place? With no mom or dad? I had to try. I'm sorry. What am I gonna do? You're gonna live. Be happy. How? I don't know. But you're gonna find a way. I can't. Not without you, not without Mom. Yes, you can. You will. For us. Please? We can't. My blood, sweat... We don't know if it's safe. [scoffs] Bree, no! No! No! Bree! [clattering] [roaring] [coughing] [roaring] [gunshot] - You okay? - [zombie snarling] [roaring] - [roaring] - [screaming] [gunshot] Bree! Good job. Come on. Follow me. Stay with me. Gun forward! Gun forward! [roaring] [grunts] I'm okay! Go! [zombies snarling] [grunting] [gunshots] Move back! Move back! [zombies snarling, roaring] [gunshots] - Let's go. - I've got a car up the road. Thank you. I'm Rose and this is Sylvia. Our home was overrun last night. We are searching for Haven. So are we. I'm Bree. This is my dad. You can't drive. Can you? Yeah. Good. So, you got a name? - Does it matter? - Oh. All right. First rule: If you start looking like you want to eat us, Rose puts a bullet in you. Got it? Got it. Just take care of my daughter. We will. Thank you. How's the gas? Quarter of a tank. [Bree] Dad? Daddy? Yeah. I'm here. I'm here. Bandages. We need to stop the bleeding. Doesn't matter. You'll bleed to death. Do it. She's right. [grunting] I'm sorry. Me too. I should've told you earlier. That bite looks fresh. It is. Second one? Yeah. I got one... on my arm earlier this morning. Bad luck. Yeah. Bad fucking luck. Let's check again. [radio static] [woman] If you can hear this, you're on the right path. Take Highway 7 and keep heading north. Stay on Highway 7. It will lead you down into a river. And then there's a path to the right. Take it. Be aware. There's hundreds, maybe thousands of them around. Run as fast as you can. If you're lucky, they won't find you. Oh, my God! - It's real! - It seems so. Or it could be a trap. Do you know where she's talking about? Yeah. Keep heading north. We should be there before sunset. [Bree] Is this Highway 7? It is. - Can we make it? - [Bree] Is there enough? Maybe. Medicine. Doctors. They can help you, Daddy! Bree, there's no cure. [Bree] You don't know that. It's been years. They might have found something. Yeah. Could be. You never know. I had no hope. There was no cure. She knew that. Rose and Sylvia knew it too. Everyone did. But she's my little girl. Hope... Every father has to let go at some point. I hope I've done enough. I know Sharon did. The rest is out of our hands now. You're just like your mother. Beautiful, smart, strong. You know you're my favorite daughter, right? Yeah. Yeah. We need you to survive. You be smart, and you be brave. I love you. I love you too, Dad. I'll never forget what you did for me. I know. [gasps, groans] You'd better go. You got this. You got this. Go, baby. [snarling] [gunshots] [snarls] [horn honking] And don't let anything bite. Sleep tight. [thinking] Fucking unicorns. [explosions] [roaring, snarling] [clicking] [roaring] [klaxon wailing] [knife slicing] Welcome to Haven. [Bree narrating] My father made the ultimate sacrifice for us. For me. I'm sure he wasn't a perfect man, but I never cared about that. He was the perfect husband and the best father I could ever ask for. Thank you for chasing unicorns with me, Dad, and for giving me a chance. I'm gonna do my best to make it count.
