Welcome. Please open it. Open it. Please open it. Thank you. Thank you. Here is the bathroom. Balcony. The mini bar. - What's your name? - Mousa. I'm gonna leave you a tip downstairs, I don't have any change right now. Thank you. Thank you. Darling, this is Hamdy. Now, Hamdy I would tell you the name of this young lady, but, uh, I forgot. She's quite mysterious. You make me feel like I'm in that uh... what's the... what's the Agatha Christie film? Um, you know this... The one with the Nile. Death On The Nile. Is that your only Luxor reference? That film had a huge impact on my life. Come on. Hamdy, this round is on me. Ladies, it's on me, y'all, I got you covered. Dunia Patunia! Thank you. Glad to see you're having fun tonight. Oh, come on. I can't have fun without you here. Of course you can't. Have you met your new mysterious guest Hana? She just checked in today. I haven't had the pleasure. Hi, I'm Dunia the manager. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Have fun. Thank you. Hamdy, it's Hana, I just remembered it's Hana. Can you turn on the light please? Sorry I just haven't been able to sleep. I just got back from a war zone. Yeah, I figured. Ali! Hello! - Hey! - Welcome, Hana. I'm sorry. We missed you Hana. Please, can we stop here? Thank you. Hey. Hana. - Hi. - What are doing here? - Um... - I can't believe you're here! Yeah... Um... I'm just on a dig. You're on a dig? No. I'm not on a dig, sorry. - I'm on a dig. - No, you're on a dig. I'm always on a dig. Yeah, um... I'm on leave. I'm on leave. I didn't think you'd be here. I'll come and find you at your hotel. Where are you staying? At the Winter Palace. Afternoon. Good afternoon. It's such a beautiful garden, isn't it? We've been coming here for forty years. I think one falls in love with the place and has to keep on coming back. Yeah, I think you might be right. Do go to Abydos if you haven't been already. - Hi. - Hi. Are there any messages for me? Let me check. No. I'm afraid there is no messages for you, Ma'am. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Now that we've arrived to this mortuary temple of Ramses the Third, I invite us to just take a moment and breathe into our heart's centers. Feeling the earth below and the sky above. And from this place here on the wall behind us, we see the great goddess Mut and her consort and beloved Amon Ra. You see that Mut is giving Amon Ra life force, energy... and in stark contrast I draw your attention to the opposite wall. And here we see Ramses the Third conquering the sea people, who came to try and take the land away from the Egyptian people. What this represents for us is our own inner demons. How do we conquer our own inner demons? Because we all can. We all can find that strength within us. And for us, what that means is once we conquer those inner demons, we offer it as a blessing to the divine. - Do you need a guide? - No, thank you. Can we have some help over here? Can someone call an Ambulance please? Quickly. They'll be coming. There'll be someone here. Hello. I'm a doctor. - What's her name? - Her name is Sarah. And what happened, did she fall over? She's fainted, she's fallen. - Did she hit her head? - No, I caught her on the way down. This happens a lot. The energy is too strong here. They get overwhelmed and collapse. Right. Sarah... Sarah? Yeah. Yeah, she is conscious. Do you think you can sit up? Yeah. Ok. Ok. How are you feeling? What exactly are these tours that you're doing? It's a spiritual tour. Wow. How did you get into that? I first came to Egypt with the Grateful Dead in '78. My husband managed the band. When I went to Luxor I just got hooked and kept on coming back. Hannoush. I came to get you. Hi. A lady named Angie left an urgent message for you. She wants you to go to Oasis hotel and check on someone. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. I know where that is. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'll take you. - Hi. - Hello. Thank you for coming. - Is she all right? - Yes. The doctors have seen her, but I just thought it would be better if you had another look. Oh, yeah. Sure. Come. - I'll just be outside. - Okay. We are going to Abydos in a few days' time. It's a long drive. I hope Sarah will be able to make it. Have you been? Er, maybe when I was a child. It's a beautiful and holy place. The ancient Egyptians made their pilgrimage there. You should come with us. - Hello! - Hi! Hi, Sarah. - Hi. - Come on in. - Thank you. - I'll give you a minute. - Hi, how are you feeling? - Better. - Good. - Much better. That's good to hear. The doctor gave her something great. Just make sure that she is not alone. She'll be great. You really should come to Abydos. I think you'd benefit greatly. Oh, I'm really busy. I can't, but thank you. Oh, well, thank you for coming. - No worries. - Alright, take care. Goodbye. What's in Abydos again? We've been there together. You know it's that beautiful temple. It's where the Egyptians used to hold their annual pilgrimage. You know? The holiest, their holiest site. I don't remember it. I mean you'd remember, it's not really a place you'd forget. I don't know, I don't remember much these days. You used to have the best memory. Yeah, not anymore. By And by the way, it's not A-be-dos It's Abydos. A-BY... DOS, Abydos. I can't believe you forgot our trip to Abydos. We had such a great time together. I'll take your word for it. For old times' sake. Yeah, like that ever got us anywhere. How come you came? I told you because I'm on leave. Where were you? I was on the Jordan Syria Border. I'm a surgeon now, so I was working in a war trauma unit. Are you going back? They want me to go to the Yemen next. The Yemen? Seriously? Yeah. Do you have someone? Come on, someone, a lover, a husband, a boyfriend. No, do you? No. Nobody serious. Well, maybe she thinks it's serious. Trust me, she doesn't. Did you have children? You? No. That's a shame 'cause I always thought you'd be a really good dad. Don't write me off so soon. There's still time. Yeah, well, I suppose you can have them whenever. But I want to see them grow up. So I'm working on this amazing sort of feminist temple. I think you'll love it. Will you come tomorrow? I know the old team would love to see you. The old team. They're still alive! They haven't died? Well, Professor Schumann died. God, I'm sorry. No, really, no I am sorry. I know. Though he was pushing like, what, 100? Trust you put it like that. - Here. - Oh, no, I'm not cold. I just forgot how pregnant this place is. Pregnant with what? You know with the history of things being here with us. Nothing to be scared of. Just tell them to leave you alone. Good night, Hannoush. Good night. See you tomorrow? Ok. Is it true that there is only one way across the Nile? Like there's a bridge but it's 45 minutes away. It's one bridge, 45 minutes. One bridge, it's right there, I mean surely there's gotta be a boat that can take me over there in like 5 minutes. Boat would be fine. So I can go see the Valley of the Kings if I go over there in a boat? Much quicker, right? - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Better than one of the hot air balloons, right? - I think so, yeah. Yeah, I don't know if I wanna go up in a hot air balloon. It's fucking scary, right? Would she be able to help me you think? Ok good. I think he's gone now. Why don't you take the staff exit? It's down this way. Thank you. Oh, hi. Hey! - How are you? - Fine, how are you? - I'm good. It's really good to see you. - Nice to see you. Thanks for bringing her. Having you here is just like old times. Yeah, I thought a lot about you when I heard about looting in the news. Yeah, during the revolution, it was quite bad. Our flimsy door didn't hold back the looters and they came in expecting gold, but all they got were bones and pottery. But, um, thank God that doesn't happen anymore with everything now. Hi. Good to see you. Look, this is our latest find. It's a Shabti. It's supposed to help you in the afterlife. Wow. You know, I went to Freud's house and I saw the collection there. Oh ya? He was an avid collector, you know. He loved Egyptology, and he loved archeology, and he said, that looking at the mind it was sort of like excavating the mind. Just the way archaeologists do the soil. So, he had lots of these tchotchkes, I know. And what was it on his desk? - I think it was a cat. - That's right. Do you ever feel like... like a... I just... I've been walking around a lot on my own recently, and I feel something. I feel like I'm aware of something. Well, yes, I think one does. I mean you're walking in places that have thousands of years of really intense human emotion. And they imbued the space with this power and presence. And I think a lot of us do, at one time or the other, feel that sort of connection. And that's what makes this work so intriguing. Yeah. She might cheer you up, give you some inspiration. See this? It's the goddess Isis. And she's suckling the baby Horus. This was really the prototype for the virgin Mary and the baby Jesus. And there is an amulet to be worn for protection to give you the idea of rebirth and regeneration. It's really a form of hope and solace. Thanks. Should we take her in? Why not? See those hackings? Yeah. This tomb was built for this insignificant King. And then the two Royal ladies, named Takhat and Baketwernel, moved in, hacked out his decoration, and painted their own faces all over the place. Sorry about the stairs. But we ran out of money. Hold onto my arm. Like that? Slowly. So those are the parts of the granite sarcophagi we found. We also found the jars that hold their internal organs. But not a trace of Amenmesse the king. Wow, who were these women? What did they do here? Don't you ever worry that you... About what? I'm just gonna get some air. I was gonna say, do you ever worry about opening up places that have been laid to rest? What, you mean like, curses? Yes. What are you ten? I just think the more unstable the world is, the more the supernatural comes to the forefront. I can't believe you still stay at the Marsam. I could never imagine staying anywhere else. I have the best memories here. Do you want a drink? Um, a glass of water. Sorry about the mess. Sultan. It's getting late, and I should go. Yeah? Yeah. Hi, can I get a Winter Palace club sandwich please? With fries. Do you want anything? No, thank you. I heard they cut down a lot of the trees, but the garden is still beautiful. I love this garden. Apparently, they're gonna redo this hotel. Which would be sad. There's something lovely about it being so faded and imperfect. - Good morning. - Good morning. How are you? Good, yeah. Did you sleep well? I did, yeah. June this is my old friend Sultan. This is June and Harold. What are you laughing about? You've become such a granny. Shut up, no I haven't I'm just being polite, and besides, I think it's really lovely seeing a couple like that. They've been together since their twenties. That's when we met. You were 22, and I was 23. Would you like to go swimming? I don't have any trunks. I think as long as you're not wearing a thong, you'll be all right in boxers. Excuse me, sir. Sir, excuse me. Excuse me. Sir. Excuse me, sir. Sir, excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Actually, you are not allowed to swim with underwear in the swimming pool. Sorry do you know where I can get swimming trunks around here? Yeah, for sure, sir. You can find it at the entrance of the hotel in the bazaars. Can I please have five more minutes? You got five minutes. And then you'll have to be outside of the pool. Thank you for understanding. This is the staff entrance here. How did you find it? Uh... I just, umm, came out here one day. Why? I can't remember. It's really quiet down here. Look, look, look. Look what I found. Oh my God, this reminds me, this reminds me so much of when we had a long distance relationship and I would call you from Kathmandu on a crappy line. Beirut was worse. I hope they don't get rid of it in the refurb. Why are you so obsessed with this refurb? This carpet is just amazing. Madam. May I interrupt you clawing your feeling the walls for a second? You received a fax from Rio De Janeiro. Apparently, your travelers check was stolen, and somebody has been caught trying to purchase a Discman. Hold. Just hold. Where are we going? To the Marsam. There's my first dig. You remember how we used to sneak in after dark? It was so quiet. And we would stand there in the moonlight. Don't be so cheesy. Hey, hey. - Hey. - Hey. Glad you guys could make it. Please take your place. - Hi, I'm Hana. - I'm Catherine, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Jared. - Hi. See that guy over there? He's one of those nutters. Someone who thinks that the pyramids were made by aliens or people from Atlantis. Hana ran into an interesting group a few days ago. So does that mean they thought they had been reincarnated? They didn't, no. They seemed quite cool. Ok. I mean, generally they think that they have been reincarnated and that they are Ramses the 2nd or Nefertari or someone, Nefertiti. It's never the beggar or the cleaner. Except for Omm Sety, Omm Sety's story is legit. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, that was different. What was Omm Sety's story? She was really amazing. So when she was a child, like 4 or something, she fell down the stairs, hit her head. They thought she was dead. And then, the doctor came, and she came back to life. And, she kept saying, I want go home, I want to go home. And they said no, no, my dear, you are at home. And then, a little while later, she was opening the Life magazine, and there was a big feature on Egypt. And so she came running around saying, look, look this is my home. So, they took her British museum, and she was running around embracing the statues and things, and she finally came to Egypt. She married an Egyptian. She started working for the antiquities. But her big thing was that she had been a temple dancer who'd fallen in love with the King. And it was a sort of story of love and remembrance. And she came and lived and worked in the temple. It was really amazing. The key thing is, she helped archaeologists to find their digs. She would tell them where to dig, and then they opened it up and they find things and tell them stories about what's the ceremony and events that taking place in these digs. Excuse me. So, she was amazing, and yeah. And she said "Oh there is a garden here," and it was just sand. They dug down and they found this garden. And they could even see the pits where the trees had been placed. Hello there. Hi. How are you? What are you drinking? Lemonade. Don't you want something stronger? No, I'm not very good on drinks at the moment. I've been there. You should definitely avoid it. Mmm. Yeah, that's what I thought. So how long are you staying? I don't know, maybe a week. Oh, wow, great. Ok, I have to take you to this lady. She knows things. She's sort of holy. What, you don't believe me? Um... you know, now people just seem to have a Shaman and a Pomeranian. What's a Pomeranian? This guy. Oh. I like Dobermans. I get a sense you're going to enjoy it there. It might be even good for you. So, have you been to Abydos yet? I've wanted to show you this place since it opened. I even thought of contacting you. How were you gonna contact me? Facebook. Are we friends on Facebook? Yeah. I can't imagine how I let that happen? Why? Because the last thing I wanna do is see you happy on a beach in Dubai with kids. That's harsh. Good morning. Hi. We're going to see Sekhmet's sanctuary. She's the patron saint of physicians and healers. I'm glad we did this. The 45-minute journey across the Nile three times a day was beginning to take its toll. Come and move in with me at the Marsam. Just at the Marsam? Well, that's where I'll be for the next two months. And then where will you be? Back to New Haven. Hmm... And what will I do all day when you're... at the dig? You can sleep, read, sit in the courtyard. There's a pool here. Don't you miss how hopeful we were? About us? Yeah, about the world, about us, about everything. Yes. Do you remember what it was like 20 years ago? I wish it could be like that. I heard this thing, the old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born. Now is the time of monsters. Who said that? You know, I've actually forgotten. Where are you going? To pee. Did you ever think that you'd spend most of your adult life here? Yeah, I think I did when I chose to do this. Yeah? But I didn't really think of it in terms of time. I don't think we knew what time was when we were young. Where did you think you would be? I don't think I thought about it, I just... I just assumed everything would just come together, you know. That's the really weird thing about being this age is that there's just not time for things to... What are you, 90? ...come together. Yes! But in your twenties you know you feel like... Sultan! - Oh, Maria, hi. - Hi. Hey, God, you're here. Yeah. I'm visiting my dad. How long are you here for? For a few weeks. This is my old friend Hana. Hi, Hana. Nice to meet you. - Hi, I'm his old friend. - What are you up to? Oh, I'm going to visit a friend on the other side. Are you headed that way? Yeah. Ok, do you want to share a boat? Hi. So why is your boat called Bob Marley? I don't know. Not my boat, it's you. Hi. Well, I'm going this way. So, um, it was so nice to see you, Sultan. And really nice meeting you, Hana. Really nice meeting you. See you. Bye. Bye. So nice to meet you. So nice to meet you. It's about the divine. And... how we project ourselves onto it. Pretty much the basis for anthropomorphic religion. We like to see ourselves in everything. My favorite is Nut. She swallows the sun. She swallows the sun? She swallows the sun. Painful. Oh no. It's like dancing lessons when you are little. I once saw someone do that. Skating move. Oh, my God, look! Have I ever shown you that? That fucking hurt. Ow! Dance with me. Dance with me. That's awkward. Morning. Hi. Hana this is Alia. - Hi. - Hi. It's so nice and cool in here. Is this part of the same group that Chloe told me about? Yeah. It's uh... it's this one right here. Do you have the other file? Ok. Do you want a coffee? Is Chloe still an archaeologist? Yes, she teaches at Brown. Are you still in touch with her? I mean she works on the digs sometimes. She's happily married, with children. Cool. They fell in love, and they got married. Yeah, she's so clever. You don't need to be clever. When it's right it just happens. Hana! Hamoush. Don't live in the past. Don't live in the past? You're an archaeologist. Your entire life's work is about living in the past. You live in the past. But we have another chance now. I'm just tired. I'm really tired. I've been in a dark place. I saw things that nobody should see. And I'm broken. I can't take anymore pain. Don't follow me. Yeah. Give her your hat. How long is she going to sleep on it? Oh, I don't know. It could take all night. I have a flat tire. Hi. Can I come in? Let's go to Abydos. That's just what I was thinking.
