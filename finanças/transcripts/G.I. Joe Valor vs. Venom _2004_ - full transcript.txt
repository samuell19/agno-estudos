...yet, once again, only adults disappeared, leaving children behind. Around the world, this is the fifth mysterious abduction in the past three weeks. Missing adults, abandoned children, in Alaska, Mexico, Siberia, Canada and Australia. In Washington, sources close to the White... Who's there?! Show yourself. Now! Good eye, Hawk. I nearly took out my own men. Duke, in this kind of combat, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between your enemy and your friend. I know who my friends are. Heavy Duty, Dusty! What you find? The enemy's cooked up a mess of trouble for us. They're gonna come at us from two directions, get us in the crossfire. Then we'll have to outflank them first. Uh, might be too late for that. Huh? No! No! Hawk! Ah, now, this is just plain embarrassing. They got me. Hey, I got him! I got the general! Wanna guess who's next? You are! I'm a goner, Dusty! Save yourself! Eat paint, you little varmints! Mama! Good flanking maneuver, men. Good thing I loaned you my old sergeant's jacket. Yup, those kids are good. We might want to recruit a couple of them someday. Good timing, though. Now, I got to get ready for the awards ceremony, but you jokers go play the next round, and make sure those kids have fun! That's an order. Yes, sir! Humm?! Mmm, it is so inspiring to see all you busy G.I. Joes playing games with the children today. I'm sorry, ma'am. What was that you said? G.I. what? G.I. Joes. The top-secret team of America's best Special Forces soldiers, operating under the direct authority of the President himself. Sorry, ma'am, I've never heard. Oh, I knew you would say that, sonny. The G.I. Joes are so top-secret, everyone who's a member has to pretend they've never heard of them. Now, ma'am, if that's true, how do you know about them? I have a secret of my own. Is that so? The Baroness! Good afternoon, General. Though I suppose it is better for me than it is for you. Destro! What 're you doing here? Mmm, why, darling, it's simple. Cobra wishes to offer you a job. I'm done, Dusty. You can have the soap now. Why? I'm done, too. Hey, you guys. Where's Hawk? He's supposed to be handing out the awards to the kids. Mmm, haven't seen him, Duke. We can't disappoint those kids. So, let's go find him on the double. Hold on, Duke. What's that? These are Hawk's. Hey, Duke. Get a load of this. You think Hawk was snatched? Heads up, Joes! We got Level One priority flash traffic. Hawk's gotta take it ASAP. "Priority One flash traffic, please pick up." Sorry, Hi-Tech, Hawk's... not available. Then you got to take the call. That's Hawk's gauntlet. It's the only one with the crypto circuits for taking calls from the top. Scarlett, Dusty, you bring Hi-Tech up to speed. Heavy Duty, you make sure those kids get their awards. Then get back here on the double. We start the search for Hawk now. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Duke, where's General Hawk? We think he might be in trouble, sir. If my National Security Advisors are correct, Hawk could be in bigger trouble than you think. What 're your orders, sir? Duke, when was the last time you went to the zoo? I can't tell you what I don't know. I never saw what hit me. Too bad that security tape doesn't show anything. You mean... not yet. Cool, a U.C.O.- Unidentified Creepy Object. It looks like some kind of big bug. Smells more like some kind of snake to me. Something's wrong in the bear enclosure. Let's check it out. Tranquilizer darts? We gotta get rid of them, or he's gonna hurt himself bad. Okay, not our usual line of work, but let's see what we can do. Hold it right there, Soldier Boy. You go anywhere near my bear, and I'll feed you to him piece by piece. Your bear?! I'm Dr. Lincoln Talbot, the zoo's chief veterinarian and animal behaviorist, and I look after my animals my way. Everyone can use some backup. You're right. Hold my coat! Hey, now, Teddy, it's me, Link. That's right, you know me. I'm your friend, and I won't let anybody hurt you. Whoa. Don't try that at home, kids. There. You'll be better now. What's that? This is for taking blood and tissue samples... but why? Doc! Look out! Ted! Here! Here! I could've handled it. Yeah. I'm sure. What's the verdict, Hi-Tech? Bad design, shoddy workmanship and a really ugly color. Which means it's another hunk of junk built by Dr. Mindbender. Huh, what a hack. So, Cobra was behind the assault on the zoo. The President was right. The President?! Right about what? Break out the new Gauntlets. There's something we all have to see. Everyone's synched up? In the past three weeks, there have been five mass kidnappings around the world. In each case, the target was a small isolated town or village, and each time, no children were taken-only adults. The missing adults around the world, the tranqued animals at this zoo, and Hawk's capture: there's a good chance they're all connected to the same Cobra operation. But what's Cobra up to? That's what we have to find out... and fast. Something bad's going on here, and if my animals are involved, those military misfits are gonna have to deal with me. Ah, there is such beauty in destruction. Wouldn't you agree, General Hawk? What is this place? This is the Viper Pit, General - your new home. And I am your new commander. I gotta stop eating those spicy burritos before bedtime. Hugh! I'm having the craziest dream. Oh, I think "nightmare" would be a better word for what you're about to witness. Over Kill! Commence the demonstration! Not my job, not my job. Mindbender's job, not my job. It's Mindbender's obsession with organics that's holding back Cobra. Get over it, you biomechanical dolt! Just get Mindbender in here! Uh, Cobra Commander, apologies. I didn't think Hawk would recover so quickly. Prepare the source material. Oh, oh and uh... General, uh, when Mindbender says "source material," he means "victim". Over Kill, have... have me the Fangblade. I don't think so. My Venomized Troops are genetically programmed to obey whoever wields the Fangblade. And that's me! Which species do you wish to use? Surprise me! You see, General, all life on Earth is based on DNA, and my genius has now made it possible to... Yadda-yadda-yadda! Actions speak louder than words, Mindbender! What have you done to that poor devil? I've given his life purpose. With a single commander... And the ability to venomize civilians by the thousands... Cobra can create an entire unstoppable army... ...anywhere we choose. Isn't that right, Cobra Commander? No, like this! Cobra Commander! Oh, what is it now? The demonstration is over. So, executive recap. Spray the green gas over a city, turn useless civilians into Venomized Troopers, crush freedom and democracy, and Cobra rules the world. Any questions? Yeah... you getting enough oxygen through that mask? Prepare the general for the maximum treatment. But that process it's not perfected. Oh, is that all? Over Kill, hook the general up to your new Brain Wave Scanner and download his memory. Download his memory. Download memory. My pleasure. Download memory. Download memory. Tunnel Rat, report. Copy that, Flint. Payload is go, go, go. A real work of art, if I said so myself. Copy that, Tunnel Rat. This is G.I. Joe Citadel Launch Control. We are go for linear induction launch of Test Payload Number One. Five... Four... Three... Two... One. Induction! And payload is on course. We're on target. Ocean Recon One, do you copy? This is Ocean Recon One. Torpedo here, copy that. Shipwreck, Wetsuit! Look sharp, men! We've got incoming. Here it comes. Wait for it, wait for it... All right! It worked! The rain generator worked perfectly! We'll be able to put an end to drought around the world! Well, we've got a few more tests to run first, gentlemen. Stay on station for next launch in eight hours! Copy that. This is Ocean Recon One, standing by. My dear friend, Slash. Yes, friend Slice? Do you know what time it is? - Time to call Cobra Commander! - Time to call Cobra Commander! - You read my mind! - You read my mind! Yada, yada, yada... Oh, get on with it, Destro! ...and so, given the time it will take to construct a suitable delivery system, my company will be able to implement the full venomization program in three years. No! I'm not waiting three years to control the world! Not three months! Not three weeks! Hold that thought. Slice, Slash, tell me you have good news. Mm-hmm. So it is fully functional? Huh?! With only four Joes to defend the whole installation? Perfect. You may commence Operation Cobra Landgrab at once. Three years to implement my master plan, Destro?! I don't think so. Ya think grenades blow up better if they're polished, do ya, Gung-Ho? Ooh... You look after these bad boys, and when the gumbo hit the fan, they look after you. Hey, what was that? Slash, please, I insist, the honor of initiating the electromagnetic pulse must be yours. Slice, no, I couldn't... unless... - We push it together! - We push it together! Fortunately, our equipment is perfectly shielded. But those Joes will never know what hit them. Hey! What was that?! We've been hit by an electromagnetic pulse! Electronics are fried! Including our lasers! Yo, Tunnel Rat, I think you'll all be glad they're good and polished now, huh? Battle Android Troopers... Razor troopers... - Sand Scorpions, attack! - ...Scorpions, attack! We've go to make every one of these count! Beach Head, get the BTR! Gung Ho, we've got to hold the fort while Tunnel Rat sets the C4! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Flint, Gung-Ho, we got to pull out! There's a second wave attacking from the rear, and they're something I've never seen before! Tunnel Rat better get a move on with those self-destruct charges! Gangway! Coming through! Now all we need is Rat Boy to get out here. Perfect timing. Is anything broken? Yeah... about a zillion of those BATs. But me? I'm fine. Then hold on to your holsters. Whoa! I think Betsy just sprung a leak. - BATs! - Sand Scorpions! - Razor Troopers! - Razor Troopers! Pursue it. Pulverize them! That's it for this buggy! This is where I get off, boys. I'm just the guy to head back for recon. But yous gotta keep going. Yeah, something's funky with the satellite com grid. I can't uplink to HQ. We got to report in person. But as soon as we report, we're coming back for you, huh? That's a promise. Geez-Louise, Gung-Ho! I'm chokin' on the mush here. I got it under control. Exemplary news, Cobra Commander. Despite this sloppy joe jumble, we will be able to piece together a working launch computer. But to operate their launcher... ...we will still need the top-secret G.I. Joe codes. Fortunately, I know exactly where to get them, don't I, General Hawk? You have no choice but to surrender. Really, Jinx, the end result is inevitable. Kamakura, you talk to much. - How did you...? - The way of the ninja is to misdirect, outthink and evade. Hmm. You'd better work on that last one. Sensei! Did you see my victory? Hey, pal, I was blindfolded and it still took you 20 minutes to take me down. Ah, sword training! Now we'll have some real fun. What's the matter, Kamakura? Did I wear you out? "Tatsu Ashi"! That's Japanese for "Dragon's Tooth." The Tatsu Ashi was forged from the cooled breath of a dragon that fell to Earth on Mount Fuji. That sounds like a legend about a meteorite. It is a sword that can only be used by a warrior with ultimate skill and selfless focus. Well, you're certainly focused on yourself, that's for sure. Prepare for defeat. Against the Tatsu Ashi, there can be no defense. I'm not fighting your sword, Kamakura. I'm fighting you. Well, this is different. Now hear this. Now hear this. All personnel report to the Briefing Room ASAP. This is not a drill. Space Com has just confirmed that our most advanced surveillance satellite has been blasted out of orbit somewhere over Antarctica. So far, it's been their game. But starting now, we're taking this battle to Cobra. Yo, Joe! Scramble the jets! Looks like we got company. This is Flight Team One. Ready for takeoff. We need more firepower! Let's hope the Thunder Wings get here fast. Heavy Duty, Scarlett, stick with me. Duke, bogey at ten o'clock! It's Wild Weasel. Mayday, Mayday! I'm hit! The great Storm Shadow... ...has grown careless. Put that quantum-code card back in Hawk's safe! And if I do not? I have been trained by Snake Eyes. And I and the entire Arashikage clan have been betrayed by him. You are a child in the way of the ninja, but if I must end your life, then end it I shall. You can try. But I'm the master of the Tatsu Ashi. The owner, yes. The master? Never! Listen, carefully! The only reason you live is to pass this message to your sensei. Annihilation... soon... at my hands... You wanna say something to Snake Eyes? You say it yourself. He heard what was said. He stole Hawk's quantum-code card. Engine's out! I'm going in! Say it again, Joe! It's music to my ears. Faked you out. Tag! You're hit! Mayday! Mayday... Mayday... Mayday... Mayday... Great save, Duke! Cobra reinforcements! We're outnumbered! It's Wild Bill and the Thunder Wings! Slip Stream's in the house! And Ace is here to baby-sit these rookies! Wild Bill don't need no baby-sitter. Just watch me powder them bogeys! Ya-hoo! Next stop Vegas, boys! Wild Bill is on a roll! Them Night Adders is splitting up. Go get 'em, boys. I hear smoked snakes is tasty this time of year. Time to subtract some Adders! Those Night Adders are here to pick up Storm Shadow! You help Snake Eyes! I'll stop those jets! I know you, Snake Eyes. You have to save her. Even if it means I escape. Whoa! Initiating retrieval procedure. It's over. Cobra's pulling out. What do you say, Duke? Do we go after them? Negative, Wild Bill. We can't risk leaving this base undefended. Copy that, Duke. Me and the boys'll stay on patrol. Sensei! Jinx! Did you see what I did? I'm probably the greatest ninja ever to... - to... - Oh, Kamakura, you're still talking too much. Hey, Kamakura, Jinx, wanna have some fun? I'm gonna see if this robot has any tasty data to download. May... day... That's it, we'll have to walk from here. I don't know about that. Hi-Tech designed this with reconfigurable technology. You think we can rebuild this vehicle into something else? Mmm, I think we'd better have to. Listen... Something's following us, bros, and... I don't think it's a parade. Let's just hope Hi-Tech knew what he was doing. There's our answer, Duke. That Cobra attack was launched from Antarctica. Right below the coordinates where we lost our satellite. If that's Cobra's new base, then that's where they're holding Hawk prisoner. We're bringing Hawk home. Hi-Tech, how come a smart guy like you doesn't know the difference between noise and music? Driver picks the station, dude. Whoever's eating up bandwidth with that racket is better give it a rest! Much better. Deploy Articulated Rocket Pods on my mark. Mark! Hey, roll up the window, will you? No way! I'm boiling! Well, I'm freezing! Ice Sabre Three, what's the holdup? Uh, just adjusting cabin temperature. Rocket Pods are deployed. The Joes have found us! I advise we abandon this facility now. Sit down! No one's going anywhere! This is Cobra Commander to Mantis Sub Control. Send out the Snow Wolves. Now, this should be a real howl. Come on, Frostbite. My lungs are icing up here! Aw, keep your long johns on. A little fresh air never hurt nobody. Duke! We're under attack! New Cobra Troopers! Like animals! Hi-Tech! Heavy Duty! You with Frostbite and Dusty, keep those troopers off our six! Buy us ten minutes! Snake Eyes! Jinx! We're going in! We gotta keep those creeps on ice till Duke can bust into Cobra's base! Then let's get down and dirty! There's got to be hundreds of those things out there! And here I was starting to feel left out. We do this fast and clean, people. Ten minutes: in and out. Synchronize Gauntlets! Mark! Cobra's right on schedule. Snake Eyes, start the diversion! I'd call that diverting. I have prepared Hawk for his procedure. Like I do everything else in this lab. Mindbender, the bioextractors from the National Zoo! All of them! But... I've never put that much venom into a single subject. He might become too powerful, even for the Fangblade! I said all of them! Now! Let's try a little of this, a little of that, uh, some of this... and all of this! Ha-ha! Oh, I love science! Over Kill, open the cylinder! Now, General Hawk, prepare for maximum venomization! Drop it! Now! Now! Now! Coil Crushers! Crush those Joes like the insects they are! See what's possible when I venomize ordinary civilians with a touch of boa constrictor DNA? That's why you came after the zoo animals? To take their DNA?! They weren't ordinary animals, Duke. They were Alphas, the best of the best. And when I venomize a born leader like General Hawk with DNA from all the alpha animals, Cobra will have the ultimate leader for the ultimate army. Army?! You mean the civilians you've kidnapped! Oh, they're merely unimportant test subjects. To prove we can create a venomized army wherever we need one. You're taking people from their homes, parents from their children! You're a... ...a monster! If it's a monster you want, then a monster you will get! Over Kill, open the cylinder! Open the cylinder. Open the cylinder. Open the cylinder. Consider it done! For all the good it'll do you... Mindbender, nothing happened! I... I told you, I've never attempted a transformation like this. Mindbender never attempted, never attempted, never attempted. As usual, Mindbender, you put too much faith... too much faith, too much faith, in organics... eh, eh, eh, organics... ...when what is needed is a mechanical solution! Like my supercharged magnetic induction fields! Induction! What's he doing to Hawk? Magnetic, magnet induction fields. Ah, ah! Over Kill's gone mad! Oh, at least he isn't boring. Now that's more like it. Meet Cobra's newest general, Venomous Maximus! Hawk?! Is that you? Duke? Help me! Stop me before I... No! You are my general, and I say... attack! I do not need your orders to lead my venomized forces against G.I. Joe. Release the prisoners! It will make for a more interesting game. Duke, what do we do? We fight for our lives. Kamakura! Get out of there! Well done, General. Now bring victory to Cobra by... Victory is mine. Keep firing into the snow! We can lose these guys in the steam cloud. Hey, guys! That's ten minutes. Time to get our man Duke. And I was just getting warmed up. You are weak, Duke. You have no chance against me. Just as your pathetic forces will have no chance against my venomized troops. His venomized troops?! Hmm... Duke, Kamakura! Time's up. Have you found Hawk? This is Duke. Cobra's mutated Hawk, venomized him into some kind of monster! We're on our way! Negative! I say again, negative! It's too dangerous. All personnel withdraw! That's an order. Oh, how disappointing. We missed the floor show. I'll dispose of this one, free of charge. This one is mine. No, no, no! Duke is mine, and l will deal with him my way. Is that understood, General? Very well. Understood... for now. Thanks for the fast evac, Wild Bill. This operational command center is a total write-off. Only thing we can do is chop everything back to Joe H.Q. ASAP. Copy that, Scarlett. Wild Bill out. See anything interesting? Maybe. I think that... Aah! You're using a kung fu grip on me?! If you wanna keep that arm, Doc, you've got some questions to answer. Copy? Copy! Question number one: What's a veterinarian from the National Zoo doing in an abandoned army base? I bet whoever tranqued my animals were the same ones who trashed your secret base. I don't know anything about a "secret base," Doc. Look, I don't give a flying fish about the military or your classified G.I. Joe unit. I did two tours as a Navy SEAL and that was plenty. The only reason I'm here is to find out why someone stole DNA samples from my animals. DNA samples?! If you've been holding back vital information about... Holding back?! I'm here, aren't I? It's amazing you could convert that wreck into this hover craft so fast, Gung-Ho. Thanks to Hi-Tech's design and the proper motivation, eh? Hang on, Joes! We're hitting the water. They've stopped firing?! Yeah, like they're afraid of water... Or something in it. Heads up! It's Flint and the launch team. Not the whole team. Tunnel Rat's missing. Ahoy, Flint! Ahoy, yourself. You swabbies got a working radio? Sure do, but our satellite hookups are spotty. I think we lost one. We lost more than a satellite, bros. Cobra captured our launch facility. But the weird thing is, they gave up following us when we hit the water. Well, then at least we don't have to worry about... Chief! Break out the re-breathers! Off the boat, Fish Face! Hey, don't touch those things. They're like electric eels. Shocking! Shocking! Gung-Ho, you're a genius! Get some metal between them and they'll short-circuit each other! Gung-Ho, get the Chief! I'll get Wetsuit. Yo, Flint! We could use some of that electrical wire out here! Hey, Polly! Wanna cracker? Cracker?! Cracker, cracker! Cracker. Come on, Polly. You can do it. Ahh! Bird overboard! Bird overboard! Okay, Shipwreck, your turn! Way to go, Polly. Polly's gone. Ooh! What is taking so long, Mindbender?! I need more venom to make more troopers! We lost too many BATs in Antarctica. I need more lab workers. Venomous Maximus, I order you to assist Mindbender! Understood? I command my army. I "assist" no one. As of now, our fight is with G.I. Joe, but remember, the Venom Troops answer only to me. Don't you ever... After Cobra has dealt with G.I. Joe, I will deal with you. He's too powerful. I warned you this would happen. Quiet! We'll use your monstrosity to destroy G.I. Joe, and then Venomous Maximus will face my wrath. Too powerful... too powerful. I heard everything, General, and I know this organization will benefit from a change of command. There's no base out here. Link, I said it was a... "secret base". That's everything we have, Link. What's your professional opinion? I don't know how it's possible, but those enemy soldiers... I believe they're humans enhanced with animal DNA. In this case, from what's on the tape, I'd say Arctic wolf. Can you reverse the process? Technically, yes, but I doubt those things will stand in line for a shot of the antidote. Hey, Doc, you invent the cure, I'll invent the delivery system. There is no door. Good move, Kamakura! They've taken Hawk... and everything else. This is Duke, calling any G.I. Joe station! Any station, come back. Duke! You're alive! Calling all G.I. Joes! Oh, it's time to tune to the Cobra Channel. Oh, hello. Today, for your viewing pleasure, we present the first and last episode of a brand-new reality show I call ...No Survivors! Run! And like all good shows, it ends with a bang. Over there! That one! Kamakura! No use! I'm stuck! Leave me. You still have a chance. This team stays together. Duke! I was supposed to watch his back. You didn't let him down. I say again, this is Duke to any G.I. Joe station. Come back! - Duke! - So what's going on down there? You guys having a party or something? We are now! Then another chunk of concrete knocked the pipe off Kamakura, and we were able to get to the Night Adder before the whole base caved in. 'Course, Kamakura isn't the only thing that needs to be patched up. I got a new gauntlet for you. Good. Because this one I'm giving back to Hawk. In person. Now, what's the latest? Flint and Shipwreck reported in from South America. Cobra's overrun our South American launch facility. So that's their second base. With our launcher, Cobra can deliver their venom anywhere in the world - transform whole cities into mind-controlled armies overnight! Even if I find an antidote, there's no way to make enough to save everyone in the world. Which means it's up to us. We have to stop Cobra once and for all. Before they use that launcher. You are cleared for vector grid 000. So, what you bring me? Your present's in the back seat, wrapped up all nice and pretty, compliments of Flint 'n Shipwreck and the boys. Brilliant genetic engineering, but there's one critical flaw. Looks like a simple amino acid substitution will make it easy to separate the animal DNA from the original human DNA. Odd that somebody would make such a basic mistake. Hey, ask me if I'm surprised. Dr. Mindburger is a couple of circuits short of a motherboard, if you know what I mean. Pow! Let's hope this does the trick. It worked! Leave the rest to me. Cobra Commander, the launch computers have been reprogrammed for our venom payloads. We can launch within the hour. You landed two hours ago. What kept you? We caught a spy - a G.I. Joe code named Tunnel Rat. He's been hiding in the jungle trying to find out what we want with this launcher. Then let's give the little rodent a front-row seat for our very first launch. Listen up! Flint's gonna bring us up to speed. We've scouted the Citadel, and this is where Cobra Commander has set up his command post. So, we figure that's where the big guys will be - including Hawk. This is the launcher. Cobra BATs have already loaded it with venomization payloads. Snake Eyes, you and your team will target the launcher. I know it'd be a lot easier if we could just blow up the launcher, but we can't. That base is full of innocent civilians that Cobra's venomized into troops, and we can't risk hurting any of them. So, our mission is first: Shut down the launcher. Second: Get Link's antidote to those venomized civilians. And third: Get Cobra Commander by the shorts and give him a twist he won't forget. Give him a twist! Okay, team, lock and load! Go... Joe! Stand by for primary launch sequence in 11 minutes on my mark. "Launch sequence initiated." Somebody'd better tell me that isn't... G.I. Joe! First wave. follow me! A rain forest? In Siberia? They have an antidote. And you call yourself a genius?! Storm Shadow, we must make sure the payloads launch. Destro! How much time? Nine minutes. Hope you don't mind we just let ourselves in. We need Venomous Maximus! Where is he?! Let G.I. Joe and the old Cobra destroy each other. Then there will be nothing to stop me... and to stop us. When I rule Cobra, you shall be rewarded. Poor, poor Mr. Rat. It hurts just to look. - Tighter! - Tighter! Very funny, guys, but let's see who's laughin' in the end. One G.I. Joe... against both of us?! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! This time, nothing can save you! Hey! This BAT makes a darn good bat! Get away from that! Make me! Let's see how you handle asynchronous phase inversion, you two-bit hacker! It's that the best you can do?! Double asynchronous phase inversion back at you, Mindloser! The antidote only worked on the hybrids exposed to it at the highest concentration. The rest we're gonna have to cure one at a time. You heard the man! Make every shot... paint ball count! Yo Joe! Now, where was I...? On the endangered species list... where all organics belong. Whatever that thing is, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. Heavy Duty! Venomous Maximus! For the glory of Cobra - we have to work together! I do not need you! I created you to serve me! To serve Cobra! You will be the servant now. I shall command Cobra! No! I-I control the Fangblade. And now I control you. Over Kill, help Cobra Commander! That's close enough! Close enough... You're right. It is, close enough! What are you doing? What I should have done long ago: clean house! Clean house! Prepare the lab for maximum venomization of all remaining source material. Yes, yes, yes! What about him? I will be at the launch platform, cleaning up his mess. All right! Now I can scratch where it itches! Incoming! Whoa! Iron filings?! How come they're stuck on me? Ow! Hey, I'm some kind of super-magnet! Ow! Hey, guys! Cuttin' edge woik, kid. Mama Rat always said to recycle! Wot's dat? Nobody want to laugh at "poor Mr. Rat" no more? "Clear the launch ramp!" "Clear the launch ramp!" We're too late! "Five... four... three..." "two... one... launch." The missile. It just stopped. This is G.I. Joe Citadel Launch Control. This launch is scrubbed. Mindbelcher, haven't you ever heard of an "off" switch? You simple-minded techno-geek. The battle's not over. Venomous Maximus has turned against you. The venomized armies won't be under Cobra's control. At least under Cobra, humanity would survive, but if those two creatures conquer the world we're all doomed. Hi-Tech, you warn the team on the platform that the payloads are still live! Heavy Duty, watch Mindbender! Scarlett, you're with me! Worthless humans. You know nothing. Those are the last venom troopers. Get 'em! All available personnel report at once to the launch platform! The launcher is still active. You'll be all right now. I'll take you to the medical tent. Okay Bendminder, you don't want Venomous and Over Kill to run the world... and I want my general back. So what do you say we figure out how to shut down that launcher from here together? When you put it that way, how can I refuse? Hold it right there! Nothing's getting launched today. Guys... you gotta help me. I'm a walking trash can. How did it happen? I got sucked into a wind generator. Ow! It charged me like a magnet. No big deal, Dusty. Best way to demagnetize anything is to reverse the polarity. Ow! Duke, Snake Eyes! Get Hawk to the center of the first ring! Hey! What about me?! Ow! Dusty, stay back! It's your magnetic field. We don't know what it will do to the one in the launcher! Ow! Hurry it up, okay? And now the world will see how a true scientific genius... Yeah, yeah, whatever. It's on. Uh, guys! We gotcha! That junk from Dusty - it's blowing right through him. What's wrong with my uniform? What happened? I'm so clean! I hate being clean. Flint! We need the antidote. All you've got. Looks like we're just ticking him off. That's all we have, Duke. Is it enough? Hawk, you have to help us now. Fight it! Any way you can. I know you're inside. We need you, Hawk. Duke. That's it, Hawk. You can do it. I do not need you to tell me that. All my enemies lined up on the launch ramp?! So, if I just press one button, I can create my first venomized army and rid myself of Duke and Venomous Maximus, all at once. I win! Hawk!
