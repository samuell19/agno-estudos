(EERIE MUSIC) (PROSPECTOR GRUNTING) No, no (GRUNTS). Get off me (SCREAMS)! (EERIE MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) REPORTER: Topping the news today, two murders and a robbery in less than 24 hours. Residents are in a panic after a gun battle erupts on their street. One person was killed and four others are hospitalized. Charlie, this isn't working. You have to make more money. CHARLIE: Carol, you know I'm on salary. I know that, I know that, but you have to something, consulting, a night job, something. You know I can't. Maybe you could, if you would stop going on those expeditions of yours every five minutes. REPORTER: Might be related to the robbery. The remaining suspects are still at large. CAROL: We need more. REPORTER: They're in their early 20s or late teens, with dark hair. CHARLIE: I'm working on it. REPORTER: 210 to 220 pounds. They are considered armed and dangerous. If you've seen either suspect, or have any information that can help. (PEN THUDS) WOMAN: No! MAN: What do you mean leave you alone? WOMAN: I don't wanna talk to you! MAN: What're you talking about? WOMAN: I don't care anymore! I just don't care anymore! MAN: Well, maybe I just don't care. WOMAN: No, now leave me alone! I don't care about this place! MAN: Yeah, I know you don't. Look, I don't wanna work all day, I come in here and look at this place. WOMAN: I work, I work. I vacuum, I try, I cleaned the windows! I do what I can! MAN: You don't wanna do nothing. You work on your hair is what you work on. WOMAN: Well then, I don't care about that! MAN: You work on, you work on buying your clothes. WOMAN: Look, I have to look good if I go out in public! MAN: Who are you gonna look good for? You don't have to look good for me? WOMAN: I don't know! MAN: I'm the only one that matters around here. WOMAN: Yeah, I matter too! I don't know why. MAN: I don't know why I married you. WOMAN: I don't care. I'm sick of cooking in this kitchen. I cook something, you're like, it's lousy. I feel like a slave! I can't leave the house! I can't do anything! This will be brief, Charles, because I'm gonna be honest with you. Frankly, Mr. Donavan, you're not worthy of tenure, and are likely to be gone before the end of the year. Sir, sir, I don't, I don't think that's a fair evaluation at, at all, I... How old are you now? 35, sir. Then you're old enough to know that fair is a subjective term used only by students and amateurs. Sir, I feel like within the next few weeks I'm gonna be able to put on your desk... It's right here in black and white. Your presentations are minimal. You have virtually no awards or honors. Your professional development has basically been ignored. When this goes out to the referees, they will recommend that you are gone. When the department votes on your tenure, they will recommend that you are gone, and when this crosses my desk, I will recommend that you are gone. And, Charles, in 31 years, the provost has never reversed one of my recommendations. You will not be tenured. Charles, I'm having this conversation with you as a matter of courtesy. In all honesty, I felt you had great potential, but it just has not come to fruition here. This just may not be a good fit for you. If you can put something on here within 30 days that shows you are worthwhile, there may be a chance. Otherwise, I'm telling you this now, so that you can start to look for something else before the end of the year. Good luck, Charles. Son of a bitch. Hey, Jared. JARED: Hey, Lia. CHARLIE: All right, guys, let's bring it in. KATIE'S MOM: Take this. Okay, okay, gotta go. CHARLIE: Bring it in, guys. WILL: (sighs) Shit, man, here we go. Come on, come on, bring it in. All right, does everybody got everything? Boots, tools, flashlight? Lia, you know we're not gonna have any cell phone service within like 80 miles of where we're going, right? Oh, well, I guess I could take pictures with it. Now, any artifacts we find will be property of the university, because they're funding this expedition. Now, as expedition leader, I'm gonna be accredited with any significant discoveries, of course. Of course. Well, that hardly seems worth going then, does it? Well, I don't, I don't know, William. Is it worth saving your failing grades? (CHASE CHUCKLES) All right, let's get this show on the road, shall we? Now, we're gonna be stopping 20 miles outside of the preserve to gas up and get drinks and stuff. Keep that in mind, guys. Professor, you wanna ride in the back by me? Ah, (CLEARS THROAT) you know, I think I'm gonna sit up front with Renee, but uh, I've gotta give directions and stuff there, but, but thanks. ♪ A shadow right around, around your pretty face ♪ Christ, how much further is it? Didn't he say that we were gonna stop for gas? I need a Coke. RENEE: Or a beer. Or a case of beer. Renee, let's get Katie drunk tonight. We're all in the wilderness. We can get naked and howl at the moon. RENEE: What? I am not getting naked. ♪ Can I stay as long as I please ♪ ♪ Just to see you tomorrow in the sunlight ♪ CHARLIE: Chase. CHASE: Yo. There's a store up here on your right, less than a mile. Pull in there. Ladies, you still with us? As much as they ever were. ♪ The sun is shining ♪ ♪ The sun is shining ♪ ♪ All around, around, around your pretty face ♪ ♪ Around, around, around, around ♪ ♪ Around, around, around, around ♪ You coming? Um, no, I, I don't think so. Okay, want something to drink? Sure, root beer. That'll be 18.16. Wow, really? Greed is its own punishment. Um, thank you. RENEE: Mm hmm. CHASE: Hey, let's ditch Professor Dickweed. CHARLIE: Come on, Chase, Jesus Christ. (CHASE LAUGHING) Unlock the door. Hey, man, I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't even realize, don't fail me. All right Chase, you're right at the fuckin' line. Just drive, don't say shit until we get there. Hello, sir, I'm Professor Donavan. You should be expecting us. ABE: Abe, these are you. Mess hall is behind us. Showers are over there. Thanks. Which one's ours? You pick. Oh, man, hey, what happened to your face? Dude! It's okay. No, seriously, did you like tangle with a grizzly bear? There are things more deadly than the wildlife up here. What're you like afraid of Bigfoot or something? Hey, man, I, sorry. RENEE: Mine. LIA: Is that a bug? CHASE: Hey, Will, check this out (chuckles). Dude. My, oh, my, wherever did you acquire such a valuable skill, man. CHASE: I use to spend summers at my uncle's ranch when I was a kid. WILL: Yeah, okay. Hey, fellas, school's provided two meals a day. Now, we're gonna have dinner here in about an hour over at the mess hall. Breakfast is gonna be tomorrow morning at seven a.m. sharp. Oh, hey, what about lunch? They're not providing lunch? We're gonna be on the mountain, Chase. There's not catering, here. (WILL CHUCKLES) WILL: Come on. All right, it's a short hike from here to the base of the mountain. Right on the trail apparently. Now we're gonna leave here at 7:30 tomorrow morning after having had breakfast. On this side of the mountain is a well known cave with fairly easy access. We're gonna stay together until that point. What? Now, the artifacts that we're gonna be looking for are gonna be buried in or near a ravine that was marked by a horseshoe nailed to a cottonwood tree next to another tree with 12 bullet holes in a tight cluster. Now, these markings were created in the winter of 1876, so they're gonna be fairly grown over by now, and they should stand somewhere between eight and 10 feet off the ground. So, we're looking for a horseshoe then? CHARLIE: A donkey shoe technically. Wait, um, stay together until that point? What do you mean? We need to cover the entire mountaintop, so we're gonna search everywhere above the entrance of the cave. So, to do that effectively, we're gonna need to split up, and then we're gonna meet back here before dark. Everyone get a good night's sleep. You're gonna need it. We're splitting up? Mm, I think I'll grab my shower tonight then. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Okay, I'll see you guys in the morning. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) RENEE: Not bad. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (DOOR THUDS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (HEELS THUDDING) (RENEE GASPS) (RENEE SIGHS) (RENEE GROANS) There was no service for the last 20 miles coming up here, Lia. So. All right, guys, this way. It's up there on your right. All right, this is the only trail to the cave. That's where we begin. Not cool. It's pretty cool. RENEE: Real nice, Will. Okay, we can rest here for a couple of minutes. Then we gotta get started. (STUDENTS CHATTERING) WILL: Have you ever seen one of those before? Hey, Will, do you know I was having a conversation, yeah? So, let's have, Lia, let's have you and Chase, let's have you guys go over to the east side of the mountain. Now, that's gonna be to your right as you exit the cave, okay? William, let's have you and Allison go over to the west side. Now, that's gonna be to your left as you exit the cave. Renee. What do you think about being my personal assistant today? Maybe for some extra credit? I sure could use some help with all these maps. Professor Donavan, we can't leave Katie on her own. Oh, oh, yeah, um, Katie, you and uh, you and Renee search the immediate area, and uh, and then go directly to the top of the mountain. I'm gonna search just over the back side of the top. Now, we all have our assignments. If anyone finds anything, come to the top of the mountain and find me immediately. Otherwise, meet me back down at the camp tonight. Oh, and uh, be sure to get off the mountain before it gets too dark. (EERIE MUSIC) RENEE: (grunts) Shit. You okay? Fine (SIGHS). You shouldn't have worn shorts, Renee. Probably not, it's good for my grade though. What did you say? I didn't say anything. What did you mean though. What does wearing shorts have to do with your grade? Really, how do you? Oh, oh, sweetie (CHUCKLES). (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DEMONIC WHISPERING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (DEMONIC WHISPERING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) How much longer before it gets dark I wonder. Sooner than later. What the hell does that mean? Let's keep moving. ALLISON: I don't feel good. Probably just not used to the altitude. Probably need some food and maybe rest. Once you get used to the, Allison? Allison, Allison. What? You've got a nosebleed. ALLISON: That's weird. All right, let's head back to camp then. (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) (GRUNTING) Good God, Allison (GRUNTING). ALLISON: I'm not even that heavy, come on. Where's Professor Donavan? He's not back yet. Why, do you miss him? Wasn't he the one saying to get back before it gets dark, dumbass. (ANIMAL SCREECHING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Dinner in 30 minutes. What's with him? What an odd dude. I guess I'll grab my shower. WILL: Thanks for sharing. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (DOOR THUDS) (HEELS THUDDING) Hello? Is someone in here? (HEELS THUDDING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) That smells really good. Do you need any help? Thanks, no. What're you staring at? Where did you get that? What? Where did you get that? It's mine, I found it in the. CHASE: Is there any beer left? Where you going? I'm making a plate for Professor Donavan for when he comes back. ALLISON: Suck up. LIA: Hey, you got any of that COOP left? WILL: Yeah. LIA: Hand me a DNR, would ya? And with that, I bid you all adieu until tomorrow. (ALLISON GIGGLING) Woo! CHASE: Katie. Hey. You want a beer? I'm good. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (WILL GROANING) Damn, baby, you should've said something. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (WILL SCREAMING) CHASE: Did you have a bad dream there, buddy? No, Allison, she, she. ALLISON: I think somebody can't handle his liquor. All right, hey, come on, brother. Hey, back to bed. Hey, sleep it off, sleep if off, sleep it off. A hot fuckin' mess. My God. You know, me too, it's getting late. What about the Professor? He's probably camped out in some cave, jerking off to an inscription found on the wall. Anyone check his cabin? Which one is his, I wonder? (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) (DOOR CREAKING) (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) Professor? Charles? I saved you some food. (EERIE MUSIC) (ALLISON GASPS) (EERIE MUSIC) Hey, guys. RENEE: Hey. Professor Donavan's not here? He stayed out all night. Dude, it looks like you two stayed out all night. (CHUCKLES) Clever girl. I had some fucked up dreams. He stayed out on the mountain all night? Yeah. What the hell? I thought that they were gonna provide us with breakfast. Breakfast isn't ready. Where's that old Indian dude? KATIE: Abe? CHASE: Huh? His name is Abe. Yeah, Abe, whatever. Isn't he the one that's supposed to be taken care of us? I'm starving. He got all weird last night and just took off somewhere. Got weird, really? Well, weirder than usual. No, guys, he's really sweet to cook for us, and... It's his damn job. He gets to live here for free. He gets paid to look after the place and cook for his guests. He should be looking after us, not just take off without a word. Totally not cool. Man, I gotta eat something. Maybe there's some Pop-Tarts in there. I'm sure that when he saw the Professor wasn't coming back he figured screw it, why wake up early, nobody's watching. Hell, he probably got liquored up worse than you two. You guys aren't worried about the Professor? You don't think it's strange he stayed out all night? What if something happened to him? Like what? I don't now. He could be hurt or lost up there. Really, Professor Dora the Explorer? Seems unlikely, this whole expedition was his idea. He bullied us into coming with him for a grade. He lives for this shit. Well, maybe Abe went to go look for him. (DOOR CREAKING) Then why ain't he back yet cooking us our breakfast? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) You wanna go swimming or something? No, not really, no. I don't wanna be off having fun when the Professor gets back. If I fail another class, I'm screwed. I'm sure he expects us to already be up on the mountain looking for that damn horseshoe on a tree or whatever. I'm bored as hell just sitting here. Let's do something. Maybe we should call the police. That's not what I meant. Couldn't call anyway. There's no phone lines or reception out here, remember? Well, then we should go to the nearest town. Seriously, guys, Professor Donavan and Abe have been gone all night. We can't just sit here and wait. What if something happened to them? Look, Katie, it's cool that you're concerned and everything, but it would take half a day to get to the nearest town, wherever the hell that is, and by the time we got to file a report and bring anyone back, the whole day would be gone, if they even believe us. I don't know. Maybe we should do something. Preferably not hang out at the cop shop all day though. I say we just chill here till he gets back. I'm still kind of hungover. I didn't sleep well either. I kept dreaming I was hearing music all night. We can't just sit here and act like everything's normal. We should go into town. Professor Donavan has the keys. Oh, good God. Dude! Dude, hey, whatcha doing? I'm gonna go look for Professor Dickweed. Then I'm going too. I mean, I don't really wanna look like an asshole when you guys find him without me. Guys, what about the police, seriously? RENEE: Katie. Maybe we can find the keys to Abe's truck or we could um... RENEE: Katie. You coming? Okay. (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) Morning, Deirdre. Morning, Lonny. RENEE: We should've brought some water. ALLISON: You think? RENEE: Will, where are you going? Well, logically we start at the first cave, and then go from there. If in fact, he's not already there that is. Can you find it again? I don't get it. What? The path, it just disappeared. Yesterday there was a path here that led to the entrance of the cave, and now it just doesn't exist. Did you just get us lost in the mountains, seriously? No, I'm telling you, there was a path like stairsteps here yesterday. I know what I'm doing. Okay, the cave is right above us halfway to the top. Don't you guys remember? Look at this shit. So, what do you wanna do, go back? CHASE: I guess we must've wandered off the trail. I didn't wander off the fuckin' trail, damn it. It's just gone. Isn't that it? Yeah. Weird. (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) CHASE: At least we beat the rain. Now what? We wait out the rain, then we keep moving. (THUNDER CRASHING) (LIGHT PIANO MUSIC) What's that? DEIRDRE: A note from Crazy Abe up at the campground. More of that voodoo medicine man crap I reckon. Says some kids found a piece of jewelry belonging to Belle Starr. Well, I guess he'd know. Not some missing Jesse James treasure. Nope, just Belle. Poor bastard. That Abe's a sweet fella. He just ain't never been the same since the accident. Accident (LAUGHING)? No, no, it was her ghost attacked him treasure hunting. Don't you forget that. I always figured it was just the peyote. He got too fucked up and fell face first on the boulders. Well, I wish the hell they'd find all that money, so they can quit looking. Leave us the hell alone. Hey, Lonny? Yeah? He says there's a professor of some kind didn't come in off the mountain last night. God, damn it, see what I mean? So, I guess I'll go up there after lunch today. See what the hell Abe's hollering about. God, damn it, son of a bitch. (EERIE MUSIC) (CHUCKLES) I guess the stereo type has some basis in reality. Huh? Native Americans and liquor, a drunken Indian. Oh yeah, I've heard that one before. Go wake him up. He can help us look. Yeah, go wake the drunk sleeping on a rock in the middle of the day. Yeah, that'll end well. Really, Will? Hey! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ALLISON SCREAMING) WILL: What's wrong, are you okay? RENEE: Oh, fuck. KATIE: Oh, God. What the fuck are you doing? CHASE: I'm gonna check his pulse. Ew, no. He could still be alive. Chase, Chase. What happened to him? Well, I think that's fairly obvious. He passed out drunk in the night and something ate him, like a bear of a big cat. We need to get off the mountain. We need to go get help. Help, help, we can't help him. Look at this. You wanna leave Donavan up here with whatever did that? He's right, we're already up here. We should just find him and tell him about this. We can't leave him alone up here to be eaten too. At least then he'd quit staring at my tits. Oh, my God, Lia, shut up. Old Tonto here was passed out drunk like an invitation to a buffet. We're waking around in broad daylight. As long as we're in groups of two or three, nothing's gonna fuck with us. I don't think it's safe. ALLISON: Of course you don't. Look, the sooner we find the Professor, the sooner we can all go home. Couldn't we just go home now, and let the cops worry about the Professor? No, he's got a point. Plus, we're already guaranteed an A after all this shit. You guys. Look, Katie, if you wanna go back down you can by yourself. I'm sure the Professor would love to hear it when we find him. What're you thinking? Just checking it out. Hey. See, you guys, I told you. There's no blood. There's no mess. There's nothing broken or torn. He's probably somewhere geeking out about a historical marker or something. CHASE: So, where is he then? He's probably close. I doubt he'd wander far without his geek Bible. Probably went to pee behind a bush. Well, he didn't head back down the mountain, or else we would've seen him. Unless he went to the West side by the lake. There's a lake? Yeah, down the base, through the woods I think. Maybe someone should go check there. I don't mind. CHASE: I better go with her. All right, let's see what we got here. Man, that was some weird shit. I never saw a dead body before. At least something finally happened on this dull ass trip. Hey, he seemed like a nice enough old dude, but I don't know him from Jack so. So, that didn't freak you out a little bit? I was scared shitless up there. Well, I can honestly say it did get my blood pumping a little. Oh hey, this is nice. Yeah, I wonder why no one's around? The season's over remember? The school made a deal with the state so we could be here after their closed. Right. Looks like we have the place to ourselves then. Ha, no password. I wonder what's in this thing? RENEE: Probably pictures of me. If he walks up here and catches you digging through his shit, you're screwed. So keep watch for me. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Where you going? CHASE: To take a leak. Shy? CHASE: Polite. Okay. CHASE: No, I need to grab a cigarette too. Now, that's cliche. Hey, I wonder if the others are having as much fun as we are? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) This is Lonny to base, come in. This is base, Lonny, go ahead. Deirdre, did you ever hear anything back from old Abe? Not a thing since this morning, hon. Okay, I guess you're gonna need to go ahead and call the South base. Get a couple of guys up here. Looks like we may have a search and rescue. Roger that, Lonny. Whatever happened with Abe? I don't know, couldn't tell you. His truck's here, but he's not here. No one else is for that matter. (LAUGHING) Ow wow, that's classic. What, what happened? That old fucker. This was never a historical expedition. This was a treasure hunt the entire time. He was using us to hunt gold. Dude, where'd you even get that from? It's all over his notes. Apparently, he's looking for gold that was left up here in 1873 when the James Gang got caught in a blizzard. There's money involved? Apparently, about two million bucks in today's money. You know, that explains a lot. A lot about what? I never said anything, because I figured he was just full of shit, but he said that after this trip, he was gonna leave his wife, and wanted me to go with him to Italy. Bullshit, that's not true. Of course it is, he said that after this trip... You're a fucking liar! Why would I lie about that? I was already screwing him anyway. (FIST THUDS) (RENEE GRUNTS) You're not fucking going anywhere with him! You got it? (FIST THUDS) (ALLISON GRUNTS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (FISTS THUDDING) WILL: Ooh. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) KATIE: Hey, hey. WILL: Damn. RENEE: It's all right, I'm okay (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (URINE SPLASHING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (URINE SPLASHING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (URINE SPLASHING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hey, you hungry? I got an energy bar! Lia! Seriously, Allison, what the hell? Everyone knows what a horndog Donavan is. Did you think you were the only one? He said that he was gonna work shit out with his wife when he broke up with me. He takes up with this freak? Bitch, I will flat out fuck you up. Guys, guys, come on. This is not good for anyone. She's right, you two can figure out who's trespassing when we get home. The emphasis on the part about getting home. So, according to Donavan's notes the James Gang stole a bunch of gold from a Mexican mule train, then came out here to hide. Why would anyone come to this lifeless rock pile to hide out? It says here that Cole Younger had an ongoing thing with a woman named Belle Starr. Lived a couple miles from here, knew the area pretty well. Apparently, they never made it back to make a withdraw from their stash. So, Professor Donavan would be famous if he found it. I call him Charles. Go to hell. Oh my God, would you both stop. What makes you think he would tell anyone? That's why he's using students. As soon as anyone found anything, he would've dumped us back home and gone solo. So where is he now I wonder? Counting his gold maybe. Something's not right. He wouldn't have left all his stuff just lying here. We need to find him. He could be hurt. ALLISON: Or rich. WILL: Allison, where are you going? To be alone, away from this bitch. (WILL SIGHS) Hey (SIGHS). Look, for what it's worth, I'm sorry about the thing with Renee. I hear Donavan's got a new freshman every year. She doesn't even really care about him. You can see it in her eyes. She's just screwing him, because she thinks it's cool and edgy or some shit. Well, you can call him out on it when we find him. He can kiss my ass! In fact I don't know why we're even looking for the bastard! I say we just leave him up here. We can go sit and wait. Still make him share whatever he finds. Well, clearly he would deny having found anything on his own and just come back later. I guess so. I didn't get much out of this damn trip. Damn it, God, can somebody just kill me now and get it over with? Well, you're right about one thing. This whole fucked up weekend definitely wasn't worth the trouble. If I had to do it all over again, I would just fail the course, and forego the whole dead Indian, missing professor bullshit. But I suppose that'll be over with soon when we find the Professor. Hell, he's probably already back at the camp. Why don't you come on back? Not yet, maybe in a minute. Yeah, okay, okay. To hell with this. I'm not gonna just sit here on my ass waiting to see if he's coming back or not. He likely ditched us for a reason, Renee. Listen, you two head east. Me and Allison will check on the top and the center. If he's found anything, we'll let him know in no uncertain terms that we're onto his little scheme. He can't cut us out. Either way you two head back to the first cave before meeting at the campground. Yeah, whatever, come on. Deirdre, what's going on with my help? Did you ever call the South Base? I sure did, Lonny. They're sending a guy. Said they'd be there in about an hour. Jesus. Hold it, wait a minute. You said a guy, as in one person? Are you shitting me? Wouldn't shit my favorite turd, Lonny. They said one guy, be there in about an hour. Lia! Lia! Come on, where'd you go, baby? Quit fuckin' around now. This isn't funny. Couldn't wait five minutes for me, bitch? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) what the hell did I do with that rope? Oh, screw it. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Lia, Lia, wait up! Baby, it's not safe for you alone. You could slip and fall. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Lia? Asshole, God, you lying fucking asshole! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (ALLISON GASPING AND SCREAMING) No, no, no, no! (BODY THUDS) Allison, Allison! Allison, if you quit now, I won't be sharing. Chickenshit. Renee, please, we've gotta get somebody to help. Okay, something's not right. You've gotta know that. You can say that again. I can't believe Charles was ever with that greedy, little gold digger. No, I mean with Abe dead and the Professor missing. He's not missing, Katie. He'll be back. 20 bucks says he won't leave without me. You don't understand the power we have over guys. Hey. Hey. Is Lia with you guys? RENEE: I thought she was with you? CHASE: No, she left me behind. RENEE: What did you do to her? Nothing she didn't want. (ROCKS THUDDING) Ow, shit! KATIE: Oh, my God! RENEE: Damn, dude! CHASE: God, ow. Are you okay? Ah, I'm okay. What the fuck? (BOULDER THUDS) (KATIE SCREAMING) Holy, fuckin' shit! Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! Renee, help me! Chase, Chase! Did you see that? How did that happen? I told you we need to get off this mountain. Something's not right. We need to go get help. Yeah, yeah, okay. We'll head to the cave, and then we'll meet everyone down at the campground. Okay. RENEE: Then we've gotta go into town for help. Okay. Maybe the Indian still has his keys in his, in his pocket. Okay. Katie, this way. Renee! What? Did you see that? I didn't see anything. What was it? There was a woman. There was a woman standing right there. She was all messed up. Come on. Hi, I'm D.W. I'm supposed to talk to Lonny. Well, glad you could finally make it, D. Dub. Hell, I was the only one workin'. Had to do my rounds then get everything locked up. So, what's going on? Something about the caretaker guy? Don't know, can't find him, but he did leave us a note implying that there's a teacher and some kids up here, and the teacher never came off the mountain last night. What kids? Exactly, I can't find them either. Well, hell. - Should we go take a look? - Yeah, definitely. So, what about this caretaker guy? What about him? He left you a note? Yeah, he left a note down at the Ranger Station last night some time. What did it say? What, it's a secret or something? Look, you've gotta take anything Abe says with a grain of salt. We don't call him Crazy Abe for no reason at all. Back in junior high there was a time when he didn't show up to school for about like a month, and when he did come back, had that big scar on his face. He didn't talk much after that, but when he did talk, he was spinning these yarns about the ghost of Belle Starr and how she attacked him up on the mountain when he tried to pick up a souvenir. He swears she was real. Nearly tore his face off. Belle Starr, the bandit queen from the Old West? Not the Old West. She lived the last half of her life right here, oh, about four miles over this mountain right here to the north. Yeah, yeah, I've heard of her. She rode with Jesse James. No. D.W.: No? No, local townfolk believe she was sleeping with one of the gang members, one of the Younger brothers, Cole I believe. She didn't ride with them. They were train robbers. She was a cattle thief. Oh, okay, so what about the note then? Abe had indicated in the note the kids found a piece of jewelry that he thought belonged to Belle Starr, and they brought it down off the mountain with them. Huh. Sounds like trouble, doesn't it? Are you saying it was a ghost? LONNY: I don't know. You know that's why they call him Crazy Abe. (D.W. CHUCKLES) I don't believe in ghosts myself. D.W.: Yeah, me neither. LONNY: But I'm telling you, there's some weird shit goes on on this mountain. D.W.: You're telling me. (KATIE GASPS) Renee! RENEE: What? KATIE: Renee, come here, come here. Oh my God, it's Allison. What the fuck? We need to get down there and help her. We need, we need to bring her back up to... She's gone. You wanna just leave her down there like Abe and Chase, Renee? She's gone, Katie. Get it through your head. We can't help the dead, let's go. My God, Renee. What, what, did you think I wanted her to do this? I didn't know she would literally jump off the damn mountain! I can't help it if she... KATIE: Renee! - RENEE: What? - What if she didn't jump? We need to go. Oh, my God. Come on, we need to go, we need to go. Professor, we've been looking everywhere for you. We found your stuff. What've you been doing? Professor? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Oh, shit, man, oh, fuck me, oh, fuck me, shit! Poor crazy bastard. What do you figure, Lonny, bear? No, ain't no claws did that. That's a straight blade knife. That's a big knife. From the looks of it, they quite literally tore him apart. That took someone strong to do that. Maybe several someones. Base, come in, Deirdre. Come over, Deirdre. Too far in? I believe so. We're not gonna be able to help him, come on. Let's find those kids. Allison, Allison! Allison, Chase! Oh fuck, fuck, where the fuck is everybody? Oh, fuckin' shit. Allison? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (WILL GRUNTING AND GASPING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Oh, Jesus Christ, Lonny. What the hell's going on here? One thing's for sure, it ain't animals. Depends on your definition of animals. What do you reckon? I reckon there's some young folks up on this mountain that we need to talk to, and we need to talk to them right the hell now. (INSECT SCREECHING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (KATIE SCREAMS) Renee, Renee! Renee! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (RENEE GASPING) Hang on, Renee! (RENEE GASPING) Renee! (RENEE GASPING AND CHOCKING) Okay, okay, okay.

No, you don't understand! Don't you even breath! You got her, D. Dub? I do. You stay on her. You keep her covered while I get the cuffs on her. (D.W. SCREAMING) D.W., D.W., God dam it, D.W. You stay right where you're at, young lady! Don't you move. Don't make me shoot you. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hey, stop, shit! D. Dub, where you at? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Ah, shit. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Shit. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (KATIE SCREAMS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Fuck you, get away from me! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (TASER CLICKING) Damn it, girl, don't you ever. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Right here. Foot up. Hands up. Deirdre, come in. Whatcha got, Lonny? We're gonna need the State Police up here, and the Medical Examiner. Roger that, you okay up there? Soon as you can, Deirdre. Yes, sir. Open your hands. You've got a lot of explaining to do. You might as well start at the beginning. (KATIE WHIMPERING) What do you want me to do with all this stuff, Lonny. Just leave it by the door. The Sheriff's gonna send somebody over this afternoon to pick it up. Alrighty then. (EERIE MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull
