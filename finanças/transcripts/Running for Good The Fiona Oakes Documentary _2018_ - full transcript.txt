(ticking) (dramatic electronic music) And it's not gonna be easy. When you've been told you're not gonna walk again, to be out there doing that, that's never gonna be easy. (dramatic electronic music) And this is the one race that you have to pay insurance for repatriation if you die. (dramatic electronic music) You can see out there people are pushing themselves really, really hard. It's like it make you wanna cry. Pick up you know thinking you're gonna be out here doing this, and then I've got to go through it tomorrow. (singing in a foreign language) (drum music) [Rich] In the Sahara Desert, one of the most extreme races in the world takes place. Marathon Des Sables, the marathon of sand. Traversing over 250 kilometers across sand dunes, mountain ranges, dry lakes and abandoned villages of North Africa, Marathon Des Sables is roughly the equivalent of six marathons back to back. Competitors are required to be self sufficient carrying all food and necessary equipment over the course of six days to reach the finish line. Available water is carefully rationed at checkpoints throughout the days, and nights are spent in open air tent bivouacs along the route. With day time temperatures reaching 50 degrees Celsius, the threat to human health if very real. In previous years, runners have died in their attempt to complete this grueling event. It has been called the toughest foot race on earth. Marathon Des Sables is a 32 year old race now. We call it the daddy of ultras. This is not a homogenized race that is constructed in order to make it nice. You have to be physically fit to do Marathon Des Sables, but then you have to be mentally fit. I have seen people in really bad shape in MDS. It's scary, you know you walk in there, and you see people you don't know if they're dead or alive. Running in sand, running up a dune, it's a bit like going to a local mall and running up the escalator as it's coming down, but doing that 50 times in a row. And then repeating that everyday. The key point of it is it's self sufficient. You have to carry all your personal belongings with you. You have to carry your backpack. You have to carry your stove, all your food supplies basically everything. Your feet are so important in this race. If you get blisters, or if something happens to your feet, you're gonna be in a bad place. You have to always be very proactive, make sure that you manage any potential problems before they get too serious. You can wreck your feet. Heat's a really nasty, insidious thing mixed with a bit of moisture mixed with a bit of sand. That can really destroy feet easily. In the Sahara, you have runners in extreme pain. The sights you see are just, some of them are just horrible. It takes a special type of person to be able to do this. A lot of the running I do is about laboriously clocking in things. I'm good. Like counting backwards. So if I've got 26 miles to run, the first mile, then I think I've got 25, 24, 23. So I do this in a similar sort of way. I'll do 100 pushes with this or whatever, and then I'll go and get my pitchfork and shovel it. It's just mental strength. I'm not gonna stop till I've done it. So rather than sit around and worry about it, I might as well just get on and do it. My running begins and ends when I'm actually physically doing it. I don't live running. Running is something I do as a job for the animals. Somebody said to me, "You've won a couple" "of marathons this year. "You've done really well." "Why not do Marathon Des Sables next year?" And I thought oh what's that? I never heard of that. Because I am the most un-clued up woman you'll ever meet. And I looked into it. It's supposed to be the toughest foot race on the planet. It's a week in the Sahara Desert. You gotta be self sufficient. You gotta carry all your own gear. So I used to think you'd drop off the end of the world if you run past 26.2 miles on a road. It never even occurred to me there were all these strange weird, wonderful, exotic races in other parts of the world. And I thought okay I've done fast races, hard fast races. I'll do this. (orchestral music) I first met Fiona in 2014. She came into the shop, and she was just this whirlwind. Like she was absolutely mad as a box of frogs. I'm not sure you can describe her in any other terms. She is absolutely extraordinary. And what's really extraordinary about her is she doesn't look extraordinary. I heard her resting heart rate's like 30 or something. It's so low that they're like, "Are you even alive?" She just doesn't seem to stop. (laughing) I don't know how she does what she does. So she runs this animal sanctuary with 400 or so animals, she trains like maybe 100 miles a week. She's just so dedicated to what she does, and she doesn't do it for her. She does it for the animals and for other people, and she's trying to promote sustainability. When you first meet her, you've got no sense that you're talking to someone that's extraordinary. And one of the reasons is that she doesn't self promote. She has no sense of actually how fantastic she is. (orchestral music) She doesn't brag about anything she does. She just gets on with it. But what she does is quite remarkable really. The beauty about Fiona is that she's taking care of you know hundreds of animals on her sanctuary, and then she's training. She's you know competing in these grueling events. Fiona, she says I'm not really a runner. Now how can somebody that runs a two, 38 marathon call themselves not really a runner? I mean she's not a runner? She's a really good runner. She's a really good runner. I've always felt quite embarrassed when I'm invited to these mega races, and people are looking at me thinking, what are you doing here kind of thing. And I know I don't look the same as everybody else. When I tell people I've got like eighth place in the Amsterdam Marathon or like top 20 in London and Berlin and Great North Run, and these are the biggest races in the world. These are not messing around with. People are like flabbergasted. It's kind of a funny story with the running. I don't like it. I lack talent. I lack ability, but probably the strength I've got is that I actually do recognize that, but I don't really know too much about running. I don't really care that much around running. I just care about the results I can get from the running. Fiona was a large baby. She was nine pound, four when she was born. My GP said she looked like a three month old baby. She lifted her head up immediately. She was born and looked around her. And my first words to her were, "Hello Fiona." I was the tom boy always outside, always outside. Love of animals, love of nature. I was a very, very sporty kid. Everybody remembers me as this like little Duracell bunny that was just always, always going. I mean it was like crack of dawn till late at night, Fiona would be buzzing along. And then I lost that. She was always an athletic little girl until she had this terrible problem in the early teens. She started having knee pain. Slightly before my teenage years, I developed a problem with my knee. I was in all sorts of pain, all sorts of trouble with it. So I went into hospital continually having the back of my kneecap scraped off, having the ligaments and things readjusted around my kneecap to kind of pivot it in a different direction. And nothing was really working. That was my right leg that was affected to start with, and then because I was leaning so heavily on my left leg, that became weak and affected. So I have having all these surgeries. It was very, very frustrating. I think I had about 17 operations in all. I was not able to go to school. I was getting too weak to go to school. I couldn't mobilize around the school, couldn't do anything. There wasn't even offered any home tutoring. And then the doctors said look we've got a serious problem. There is a massive conglomeration behind your kneecap. It is turning it to jelly. It is crumbling inside, and it needs to come out. And it needs to come out quickly. This is gonna be a big operation, and this is going to be very painful. I have to say I've never been in pain like I was in after that operation. I couldn't lay, I couldn't move in me bed. I couldn't literally alter my position in my bed. I was told I wouldn't walk again properly let alone be able to do sporting activities especially things like running which were high impact. I was gonna be registered disabled at one point 'cause it looked so hopeless. So that was an incredibly challenging time for all the family actually. Oh, it was hell. It was just too bad to go there. It's left her with an extremely painful knee. I think it hurts most of the time. I don't think there's very much of the time that it is pain free. The operations are bad enough, but it's the treatment and the recuperation and the work that has to be put in after these orthopedic operations. It just went on and on and on until she was 19. It's very extraordinary to have anybody who's had repeat surgery let's say more than three or four procedures on a patella who has not been disabled. I don't look back at this time. I'm not bitter. It was difficult, and I don't like revisiting it. I'll be honest with you. I really do find it difficult. There's been some extraordinarily miserable times, but they've made me the person I am. And I acknowledge them and embrace them for that. I really do. And I definitely know what it's like to suffer myself. So I can relate to it with other beings whether they be human or not. And I certainly don't want to inflict it on them unnecessarily. She's growing all shy and bashful. Over the years, we've had hundreds of dogs. I mean at one time, we had 26 dogs living in the house at one time. We've had lots and lots of dogs. Poppy's story is that she came to us, and she'd been obviously used for fighting. And she's got the classic signs of a dog that's been used in a fighting ring in that she's quite nervous, and she's got no ears. Anybody knows this particular breed knows that when they fight, they always attack the head, and their ears are what suffer. Unfortunately Poppy's ears were ripped off in a fight. She's a very loving dog, and just a typical example of how humans abuse animals. She's got a set routine. She comes in this time, she has her tea. And she knows how she likes to live her life. She actually likes to live her life very quietly. When Fiona started the sanctuary back in 1993, we were both at work, but we decided when we started to get more animals in, Fiona would look after the animals, and I would carry on with my job. We deliberately set out not to have the animal sanctuary as our means of living. Our money, we could earn in a different industry, and then just use that money to fund the sanctuary and obviously encourage people to donate to the sanctuary knowing that 100% of what they give goes towards the feed bill. Every penny we've got has always gone into the sanctuary absolutely everything we've got. And my mom too, you know like we were trying to buy this place, sold her engagement ring, a piano, everything had to go. That's been how it's been ever since we've been here. Oh look at his little nose. She just loves taking care of the animals. She knows them all by heart. She knows their personalities, everything yeah. It's incredible. And she's such a kind person that she doesn't say no to any animal in danger. These came from a place up north about 300 miles away, and they are what they call cade lambs. Brian was one of 36 cades that we were offered by a farmer which we took on, and we have been trying to hand rear. We've got 400 rescued animals, so managing 36 babies basically is very, very difficult. Brian came, and he was very, very weak. He collapsed and we brought him into the house. We did everything for him that we could. And we thought he was gonna die, and he didn't. He didn't die. He pulled through. I don't quite know how he pulled through. There's stuff that needs to be done all the time. There's animals to see to, there's medications to attend to, there's maintenance to do, there's a list of jobs as long as your arm. The thought of having to do all that work, and then go out and run 20 miles. It's not even just like oh I'm just gonna do a nice little country job. It's appalling speed work to have to fit in, or an appalling 20 mile road run, and then come back, and as soon as you get back, to have to then start the evening jobs which is like bringing all the horses in, getting them back. It just, no, even though we've lived together 24 years, I have no idea how anybody can fit all that in. Because we were so tight on money, I mean for the first year or two we were here, we had nothing, and that's kind of when the marathon running kicked it. I thought it's cheap to do. You can do it anytime day or night. You don't need a lot of equipment. So that's basically why I took to running. There was no great desire behind it. It was just something physically that I thought I could make work for the animals. If I had a patient who had no kneecap who wanted to do some running or marathoning activity, I would tell them to stay on level ground. Can you imagine running downhill without a kneecap? I don't understand the engineering aspect of how you can run it without a kneecap. Your kneecap's there to guide your quads down so they can run effectively, and also it stops the over articulation of your knee. So I'm not sure how that's possible. We always caution the patients if they don't have a kneecap, you can't backpack downhill with heavy packs even medium weight packs. When you start climbing and especially as you start descending, that's where that kneecap comes into activity. As a physical therapist, I mean it's pretty amazing when I see individuals competing that push the limits of endurance and strength without certain body parts and then Fiona's case, here she is you know running without a kneecap. It is kind of mystifying like how does that happen? But Fiona's found a way to adapt and move her body and challenge it not just get through daily life and taking care of animals on her sanctuary, but then meeting the demands of an ultra marathon, meeting the demands of a multi day event. I'm spending a lot of energy training 100 miles a week for 10 week block before a marathon, dedicating yourself to it. It puts us under a lot of stress, and then you come to your taper period, your paranoid about getting ill, your paranoid about getting an injury. Impacts on your family life. [Rich] Two weeks before Fiona was to begin Marathon Des Sables, she contracted a severe respiratory infection. Unable to train, she was bedridden for eight days prior to leaving. (singing in a foreign language) (drum music) We fly into a place called Ouarzazate. We call it the gateway to the Sahara. And even from there, we've got another six hours by coach to the start line, and the start line changes every year. (singing in a foreign language) (drum music) You are shipped into the desert to this unidentified destination where you see an awful lot of tents in a big circle. You wander around the camp, and you search for a tent which appears to have a space in it. (dramatic music) If you are traveling and running alone, you arrive alone. You find a place in a tent with which that will be your place for the week. You're allocated a tent number. That will be your tent number, and the place in that tent will be your place for the week. (dramatic music) Yeah it was a long, long journey. I had a dreadful day yesterday. Brian died that little lamb, and he died in my arms in my bed in the middle of the night. 10 days I've nursed him. And we got the vet so many times, and I took him to bed on Wednesday night, and we thought we gave him steroids, and we thought he was getting better. You know he has these episodes of collapse. And then at quarter past three in the morning, he just woke up and died. And we've got I think about 38 left, lambs that we're hand rearing four times a day feeding 'em. I'm still on antibiotics till tomorrow morning. My mom's ill. Martin's coping as best he can. I've got the most blinding headache, and I've had headaches with this on and off for the two weeks. I had to go the doctor. I had to go and get some antibiotics, and she gave me a 10 day course to finish tomorrow morning. If I feel ill, I think I've gotta make a choice of whether you do something cavalier and just you know carry on and see if you can push it. The things I've had in the past, when I had broken toes before now, that's very much if you can contain the pain, you can contain it. But this is systematic, and so I'm not sure that it's a good idea because you can't bluff these conditions. I don't know. I'll just have to see. Don't know that's all you can do. If you don't try, you don't know. That's the problem. It's a bit disappointing the way I feel. I have to say. (dramatic music) Had a lot of stress over the last three months, a lot of extra work, a lot of extra commitments. And you can get ill. Anybody at anytime can get ill. So I just hope that you know I think what I'll do is I'll just go to sleep now and try and just relax it out in the system and just try and rest up and see if I feel better in the morning. (dramatic electronic music) (piano music) It's a very big juxtaposition to go from one morning you're looking after your animals, the next morning you're in the Sahara Desert surrounded by a multitude of people who are all into their running and into their statistics. And you kind of feel like you don't belong. Unless you know anyone, you are confined with these seven strangers male or female for that entire week. You've got space in that tent with which your bedroll fits, and that's your home for the week. (piano music) I tell you last night thought, last night. You know when you've got the headache that makes you feel ill, and you just know you should eat, but you can't. And you just need to shut off. I think it was also, yeah I'm not well. For sure, I'm not well, but the stress of leaving that environment to be in this environment. You know I'm coming from temperatures that are really cold to run here, and I have done nothing. No race, no nothing. I've been busy all year with the animals, and then with the lambs, and then the illness, so I'm not in a great place. But you know we'll see. I really haven't had a lot of time to kinda go through packing me pack and unpacking it and packing it. So it's all a bit last minute 'cause I've been ill for two weeks. And that was kinda the two week period that I'd intended to dedicate to doing some of this stuff. (piano music) Basically everything you're carrying it pretty essential in terms of becomes very, very precious. But now I'm gonna do my grand weigh in of the pack and see what a nightmare it is. (piano music) (electronic ticking) Oh, that's a mother pack. That's an 8.9. (laughing) That's a heck of a pack. Yeah every little thing does add up. Obviously it doesn't feel heavy when you're carrying it through an airport. But when you're carrying it trying to get up a sand dune, then you're thinking to yourself really I do need to lose some here. (piano music) On the Saturday, you have everything that you're not gonna carry with you on the race taken away from you. That is shipped off back to a hotel somewhere you know in a local town. You go through registration. You get technical checks. You get the medical checks. They check the weight of your bag. There's a minimum weight to every bag, six and a half kilos. And they check you've got sufficient food. They make sure that you've got 2,000 calories a day to keep you going. It is enough nutrition to get you through, but it's certainly not enough to be comfortable with. You're then left in the middle of the desert, and you start running. (piano music) [Rich] The first stage of Marathon Des Sables traverses primarily rolling sand dunes for over 30 kilometers. This will be the shortest stage of the entire race. Runners are given a generous 10 hour cutoff time to reach bivouac one where they will stop for the night. So you get up in the morning. You prepare yourself meticulously to run each stage. You're constantly worried about losing thing. You've got this tiny little backpack with which to put everything in. Everything becomes so precious. Every painkiller, every boiled sweet. Everything you've got becomes so precious 'cause you simply cannot replace it anywhere. If I'm like blinking hard, I've got a choice. I'm free to do this. I'm free to stop doing this. The reason I'm doing it is for those that aren't free to make it stop. You know people living in camps far worse than this that are not able to just say actually I'd like to go home to my luxury house now. You know okay, and you know same with animals that are imprisoned. They aren't free to just say I've had enough. So yeah, that's what I'm gonna kind of think of today. (dramatic music) MDS should not be run when you're physically sick. That's something I wouldn't recommend to anyone because you have to be in a perfect state to do that. And even when you're in a perfect state, things can go wrong. If you're on antibiotics, I personally wouldn't do it. But with Fiona, there's a reason for everything what she does, and the reason is far greater than you know how she's feeling. The lack of training the last couple of weeks is not as big a problem. There's still this thing lurking in my system. Probably another week would've been a lot better for me to recover. When it's actually systematic, you do worry that you can feel yourself starting to boil from inside. So it's very hot, but because you're over exerting yourself, you come in very hot from inside as well. If you overheat, you've got no way of coming back from it. You don't wanna be on your maximum out there. You've got to be able to think I'm operating at only ever at 80% with possibly 100% when you're really in the dunes. That's when you give it your all because you can't get over 'em otherwise. I've been in some dunes here, and I've been literally coming over 'em absolutely desperate thinking I'm really frightened now. I've not got any water. If you're in a dune section, you won't come out of it with any water in your bottles when it gets really hard. And it will get really hard. But I have promised that if I genuinely do not think it's the place to be, then I will leave because obviously I don't want to be coming home in a box. And this is the one race that you have to pay insurance for repatriation if you die. Because obviously you can see out there people are pushing themselves really, really hard. I've got my injuries. I've got my problems. So I knew it's not gonna be easy. When you've been told you're not gonna walk again as a teenager, to be out there doing that, that's never gonna be easy. But I just want to show people it is doable. I hope it's doable, but we'll see. (dramatic music) I think it's very, very difficult to do a race like Marathon Des Sables if you're not 100%. It's an enormous challenge for your body, and I think if you run it being unwell, you take a huge risk. Because of the sheer exhaustion you're putting yourself through in a very, very extreme environment where it's really, really hot. It's a very big risk to take. This isn't my sort of running at all. But without the cold, without the flu, you know I could be pushing harder. [Runner] And you run for animal? Animals Sanctuary. Right, I'm gonna cut along. I shall see you along the way. It is quite inspiring actually to see how many women are taking on this challenge. And women are actually I think surprising some of the men what they lack in the actual physical strength of the top runners, they can match in the mental strength. And that's what this race is about being mentally very strong. It's about determination, and I think women are showing that they can do that equally as well. And I think it shows how maligned kind of women have been through history. It's quite shocking to thing 1984 was the first marathon that women were allowed to run in the Olympics. And now you see women out here doing this doing something that is so physically demanding. You know some men couldn't do it. (dramatic music) It's just a job to get done. Just do the job. That's all it is. Whatever way you can, just do the job. And the reason you're doing the job is always in the forefront of your mind. It's not pushing your body in terms of running. It's pushing your body in terms of what it will tolerate before saying actually no I don't want to do this or can't do this. I mean this is like 30 K. There's another 208, and they're harder, a lot harder all of 'em. (dramatic music) Good morning, it's Sunday morning at the sanctuary. And people might be wondering what happens on a Sunday morning. Particularly with Percy Bear now that he's got an increased number of fans. So I thought we'd just have a quick visit to see what he's up to. [Steve] Percy is the lifelong companion with Martin as well by the way. He's the other lifelong companion, but he takes second place next to Percy. Have you met Percy? (laughing) Percy is also with Fiona wherever she goes. Normally sits in Fiona's hand and is shaped like a bear. A bit like I imagine you see you know you have Indian spirits that are kind of replicated in different icons. I think there's a spirit within Percy. So Percy is just a little mascot of me, my running, like my cheeky little alter ego that goes everywhere with me now, traveling companion. Yeah people then say, they ask why are you carrying that? They ask you the question rather than you forcing it upon them. And it's just a gentle way, a more subversive way of drawing people into the story. Somebody in Brazil started the Percy supporter group. And people from all around the world started to send me bears for the Percy support group. So I put 'em all in here, and that's where they live. You can hear Fiona a long time before you can see her shouting, "Can you take a photo of me and Percy?" That's how you know that Percy's got a tiny body, great big personality, absolutely inseparable. When Percy's there, people tend to laugh and they joke. And it's kind of an olive branch to say I'm not threatening. And it helps me as well. I've got another mouthpiece where the focus of attention is not necessarily always on me 'cause I don't actually like it too much. Everybody's counting like in grams. Obviously I'm counting in grams. And then all of a sudden in goes Percy. And he's not actually that light. Actually I think he's gaining weight. I'm not gonna let him sit at home. He can suffer it with me square on. [Rich] Stage two of Marathon Des Sables covers 39 kilometers with a cutoff time of 11 1/2 hours. The first 25 kilometers consist of rocky plateaus, hills, and sand dunes before making the steep climb and descent over the mountain pass known as El Otfal Jebel. (dramatic piano music) I'm quite worried 'cause I was actually cold at night, and everybody else was a bit warmer, and I was really cold. (dramatic piano music) You're amongst the best part of 1,000 people usually 1,000 plus other people, 35 nationalities. It attracts people who want a lifetime adventure, and they get it in spades in the MDS. (dramatic piano music) The MDS is 90% mental, and the other 10% is in your head. Well I think for extreme runners it's just this idea that we are just pushing our limits. We're just so curious to know what our mind can handle and what our bodies can handle. (dramatic piano music) Decline tires your legs, but you need a lot of leg strength to control your muscles coming down because when your legs get tired, fatigued, they're not behaving as they should. That's why I was worried actually that I might not have the strength. I was quite concerned that I wouldn't be able to hold myself together. Just thinking I'll go for it. I just wanna get down. (dramatic piano music) And it's prone for injury. I mean you could injure yourself at any point. You could trip. You could your knee, quads and knees. People fall, they bang their heads, heat sickness. Anything can happen at anytime. (dramatic piano music) Actually when I came off the jebel, I felt really strong, and I ran into the checkpoint, and it was when I stopped, I felt awful. I started to feel very, very sick. (dramatic piano music) But fortunately I got enough water to collect myself. At the end of the day, I'm grateful that I'm able to even consider doing this 'cause there's a lot of people that aren't able to do it. They haven't got their health. So to be able to be in a position where you can even consider coming here and doing this is a win. It was hot out there, and main thought passing through my mind today was how hot is it in a cattle truck? And they haven't got any water. My mind drifts off always in that direction. I know I should be thinking about me self and what I'm doing, but truly my mind always compares. I'm ashamed when I think, we're moaning, and because we're suffering. But we're not suffering. We're not suffering like animals. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the animals. No way would I be away from the sanctuary. I am here now, and I want to make the best of it. But it is a spectacular place to be. It's awesomely beautiful, serene. Privileged to be allowed her. (dramatic music) When you can see the finish, if you can jog and run into the finish, it gives you think like I did actually get it right. I didn't actually crawl into the finish line, have to walk in and collapse. I did actually get that one right. (dramatic music) (beeping) So after a long day in the desert, a hearty meal is required. But instead of a hearty meal, you've got this. So we have to prepare ourselves for this. [Runner] You need this walker at the marathon. [Man] Extra large, and (muttering). [Man In Orange Shirt] It's actually better than him. (muttering) [Man Off Camera] Oh, not too bad. (muttering) (laughing) (muttering) Looks like it's going to be a cold meal for me tonight. (speaking in a foreign language) [Man Off camera] Literal translation. (muttering) I don't eat that much out on the course. It's not energy I'm gonna lack out there. Bearing in mind, I only eat one meal a day at home. I'm not doing that here. I'm taking snacks, and I am forcing myself. I would expect to be on my feat all day at home and eat one meal. And that would include a run, and I never, ever take anything in a road marathon. So I'm quite able to run two, 38 in a road marathon with only taking water. It's difficult to be surprised by Fiona because she's just everything she does she does to the absolute maximum. And obviously when she said she was going to try a marathon, I thought okay I know she's gonna do fine. And she did a marathon, and she did it I think under three hours. And it was just like this is your first marathon. When she started winning marathons and winning local events. You say oh right, okay, you've won another one. And obviously she was doing it to try and build herself a platform from which she could speak. And she found that obviously from winning local races to winning marathons still wasn't giving her the platform she wanted which is when she started to turn to you know the endurance events. When Fiona was offered the chance to run at the North Pole, it was just like okay, fine. You know it's kind of like you expect her to come up with something that most people would say, "What?" If you say to someone, I've done a marathon. People know it's extreme. They know that the North Pole is extreme. So I figured put the two together, North Pole and a marathon, you've got a win here. That's definitive hard core. And I just literally went out as normal running, came back, walked into the house and said, right Martin, I've got something to tell you. "What's that?" I want to do the North Pole Marathon. And he just looked at be and ah. Because of the knee condition that I've got, I cannot afford to slip. If I slip, I tear, I dislocate it very, very easily. There's nothing to keep it stable in there. So I didn't really know whether it was going to be possible for me to run in these conditions. The race organizer wrote to me and said if you will consider doing it, I will give you the place. And then it was like well game on. It's a massive opportunity, and it might never come again. (dramatic music) When the plane door opens, it's just like whoa. The reality just hits you. All you can see is just snow. You can hear the ice and the water underneath you cracking. The cold is the kind of cold that you throw some water up in the air, and it freezes. There's no going back. I'm thinking about hypothermia and potential frostbite. You've got to be very, very careful. I had spoken to the other runners, and there was almost like an overconfidence to them. Fiona was really refreshing because here she was touted as one of the elite runners sharing with me in all honesty that she was terrified just as I was. And I looked at her I'm like how can you be terrified? So we're laying there in our cots, and we're just like staring up at the tent ceiling going this is gonna be brutal. And she was like, "Yep, it's gonna be really hard." It reached minus 30 at its coldest point. Like you'd take a step, and you'd sink down to knee deep snow. There are parts that were super icy, and you couldn't really get good footing. It is one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had. Fiona is a legend. She ended up winning the North Pole Marathon very, very easily. (dramatic music) Probably I did a bit too well. It caused a bit of animosity from the point of view of the other runners. For a woman to come out here carrying a small teddy bear and humiliate us. I placed with the men, got the course record. I came in like six and a half hours later, and she hugged me, and she just said, "I am so proud of you." And I was like really, "You've been laying here" "for six hours waiting for me to finish." And she was like but I think you were the toughest. She's so incredibly strong, and she kind of denies it in herself, but she's so willing to acknowledge it in others. Honestly like I've never seen someone so strong and so humble. When I actually finished the North Pole Marathon I was absolutely elated. Not at winning the race, not thinking of anything more than the fact that I'd got through this awesome achievement of surviving out there. She runs. "Oh yeah, I finished." How did you do? "Oh, I won." You won? You (laughing) won? "And I broke the course record." I was just like oh okay. [Rich] The course of stage three for Marathon Des Sables is exceptionally challenging and dramatic. Runners are required to scale three steep technical mountains over 31.6 kilometers. The first strenuous ascent forces racers up a sandy rock strewn slope. Once summited, runners must navigate along the ridge of Joua Baba Ali Jebel before dropping down to check point one only to have to climb back up again on the other side of a dry riverbed. In an almost sadistic design, the third and largest climb takes runners back over the mountain they scaled the previous day, a treacherous technical and exposed route of jagged volcanic rock. After descending, 10 kilometers of stony plateau still lays ahead of racers before camping for the night. I'm actually really worried about today, seriously worried because it all climbs, and my knee does not like to climb. It protesteth something rotten in the street. I was just thinking that I was running along yesterday. And I've got my cashew nuts out, and it all went horribly wrong with some poles banging around my feet, and I was just getting in a right kerfuffle with bag open. And I didn't get them all in my mouth. And they kind of went to the side and round my cheek. And I'm so desperate to not drop these two cashew nuts, that they're rolling around my cheek to get 'em back inside my mouth. I'm like what am I doing? It's two cashew nuts. And I'm thinking oh no, that's like 25 calories. Get it in my mouth. Don't let 'em fall on the ground. Some sort of ludicrous, mad person going along. (laughing) It puts it in perspective. Too much perspective. (laughing) (dramatic music) The reality hits here. It's not called the toughest foot race on the planet because it's a 10 K. You know Sunday morning, it really is tough. And they pride themselves in making it tough. (dramatic music) It's hard, and it's long, and it's relentless. It's completely alien, and you just want it to go away. You just want to cry out there. You just want to cry. (dramatic music) I've got a faint idea of what the climbs were. And I thought oh no, they can't be including all those in. But they did. (dramatic music) That's me gritting it out. That's not me doing something that I want to do at all. I would never dare to do that attempt because at some point I know my leg would give up. And today when they said the three climbs, I thought if there's three climbs, there's three descents. That's a problem to me. It genuinely is. I mean in truth I think people would be shocked to see what you've gotta do. It's nothing to do with running. It's almost like rock climbing. It's so steep and sandy, and you're just left to your own devices. You get frightened. You think I can't do that. I cannot do that climbing. I literally can't do it, and I get use my right leg. It's not got the power that my left leg, so everything has to be done from the left leg. That scared me. That really scared me. This was somebody who was told they wouldn't walk properly when they were younger. (dramatic music) It is insane. You wouldn't be allowed to do it in any other country, wouldn't get away with the health and safety. You just wouldn't. It's mental. You do see grown men cry out there. (dramatic music) I was just so relived to get down there. I was so worried when we got to descending. (dramatic music) Man, that was hard. It was really, really hard. I just wanted to sit down and cry in fact. I don't wanna do this. I just don't wanna do this. I just don't wanna do it. I'm doing it for the animals. I'm not doing it for me. (dramatic music) That's one of the worst days I've know in this race. You saw Fiona suffering. You saw her in a lot of pain. (dramatic music) The most important things that you're gonna do is get ready for tomorrow if there's gonna be tomorrow. You just gotta prepare for it. This is one thing that makes me really appreciate when you get back home. One tiny drop of water and a towel, and it feels so good. It feels better than any power shower you could ever go under. You know because you're here in these conditions, and you're really appreciating it. And you really use every inch of everything. Something that in the West we're guilty of not doing. I'm not saying everybody should live like this. I'm not asking everybody to live like this. I'm just asking people to consider that people do have to live like this, and how lucky was are to not do. As you can see, my toenails are now so blistered they're comin' off. No point in trying to keep 'em on. I'll just pop 'em and put iodine on. Yeah, I'm about to lose my big toe nails, and they are sore. They're like sore, man. They've got some bashing. I did something actually tremendous yesterday. I was in such a state of confusion, I put Tabasco on my toes. (laughing) Yeah, I picked up the wrong pack, oh it's there, and in total oblivion, I just poured it on my toes. Probably did 'em good actually. (groaning) [Man In orange] Damn you. This isn't. This is a sand storm I think. [Man In Orange] Ah Fiona, your socks. [Fiona] Have you got two socks there, two small ones? - Yeah, two little ones. - Thank you. Seeing it there, it just blows up like that. (muttering) [Man In Orange] That's great that the helicopter came, and suddenly it started. (muttering) Fiona has some remarkable achievements under her belt, and she doesn't really get the media attention that she actually deserves. (dramatic music) When I came back from the North Pole Marathon, the BBC contacted me immediately. They said we'd like you come to Salford. We'll pay your expenses which was a big thing for me. Bring your mom that's fine, get you a hotel. We want you to open and close BBC Breakfast. And the researcher said there's just one thing, we would prefer it if you didn't mention the fact that you're vegan. And I thought but that's the whole part of me being there. That's the punchline. That's the barrier to getting the athletic achievements out there. It's because I've done it with a hidden agenda as far as their concerned. I wanted to do it to promote something which they're not happy to promote. I sat on the sofa there live, and I was literally the whole time that they were kinda talking and questioning me. I was thinking how do I mention the fact that, dare I, dare I. I better not. What do I do, how do I do it? How do I say it? And in the end they kind of say to me why did you run a marathon at the North Pole? And I think that if I'd have said because I'm just an airhead kind of adrenaline junkie, and I just wanted to do it 'cause it was there. I think that they could've connected with that a lot better than the answer I gave. I'm a lifelong vegan. And I'm a patriot of the Vegan Society. It's their 70th anniversary next year, and I was looking to do something really, really special. So I just thought what's the most extreme thing I can do. I've done a lot of other marathons. As I say, I wanted to prove I could do it on a vegan diet and raise money 'cause I run an animal sanctuary and sort of help them as well. The second part of the interview came later in the show. There's no uptake on this vegan diet. They've completely blanked it. They didn't want it on there, and that's it. We have had reporters who told us off record. I can't really feature you because you're flying in the face of the people who pay our wages, the advertisers, they're paying them to sell their meat and dairy. And here we are promoting a vegan athlete who's showing actually you don't need all that crap. If Fiona can do what she does and has been vegan for 40 years, you know surely a vegan diet will be enough to manage you down the shops to get your weekly shopping from Tesco or wherever. So many people have it in their mind. I mean I have it too this idea that you need to have meat, you need to have animal protein to be able to push harder and faster. But I really think of what I'm putting into my body is fuel that's gonna fuel my workouts, but also fuel recovery. And I think that's probably the biggest benefit of a plant based diet is that ability to fuel it with the best fuel possible, but then it's also the fuel that's gonna help recover you. That's going to allow my muscles to heal, to allow my body to be ready for the next workout, or to be ready for the next race. I genuinely see food as a fuel. I'm not a food obsessive person. I respect food. I respect the fact that I have enough food. And that's something that which a lot of people in the world and animals do not have. She only eats one meal a day, and she eats that when all the work is finished for the day. She will then eat. And she eats methodically, slowly, and then she goes to bed and hopefully sleeps. When I came back from the North Pole, that's when the world record attempt came up. There's a record to be the fastest woman in days to actually do a marathon on every continent plus the North Pole. I explored the possibility and potential costs. No way we could afford it. This is an opportunity to get in the Guinness Book of World Records as a vegan, and I'm throwing it away. And I knew I was throwing it away because there's no way I was gonna go back to the North Pole and run that marathon again. I thought this is just too good to miss. I just can't not do this. Surely to goodness I can't not do this. But in the meantime, I'd written to one or two people to ask for help. And a guy from America had actually written back to me and said he'd like to support it. It was pretty much game on then. The first race I ran, I won. I didn't intend to. Martin said to me, "You do realize that" "if you could do that in every race, "you would actually become the fastest woman, "you'd get three world records instead on one. "You'd be the fastest woman in running time "in actual physical ability wise not just logistic-wise" "to run a marathon on every continent and the North Pole." The pressure then was on to no just amble around these races was actually to run 'em and do as well as I could in 'em so when the accumulated times were rolled together, I would be the fastest woman ever to actually physically run on these continents. We're just saying goodbye to Fiona and her mom now as they journey halfway around the world to Australia. [Meg] Hello Mr. Percy. Are you ready? Did he make the right decision finding his coat? [Martin] Yeah, he did. (dramatic music) [Fiona] We were in Australia less time then we were flying there. Tip out of the plane, run the marathon, do the championship time, get back on a plane so that immediately I arrive, Martin can go to work to cut down the amount of days off he's having to facilitate me do this. Morning, it's eight o'clock in the morning. Fiona's getting ready with Percy to go in the taxi to Omsk in Siberia. And we're just gonna go through the final checklist to make sure she's got everything that she needs to have. Running gear? Yep. [Martin] Currency? Yep. [Martin] Trainers? Yep. [Martin] What about the training? You've done the training? What training? [Martin] For the marathon. You have to train for them? [Martin] Yeah. (muttering) The Omsk international marathon is the biggest race in Russia. I'd had no sleep, and then tip out and run, placed in it, and it was quite tough. Every time I was running these quick times, the pressure was then on to keep doing it to get these three world records instead of the one world record I'd originally set out to do. And the next challenge was to go to America. The nearest one I could find on the East Coast was the Atlantic City Marathon. I think I won that race. (dramatic music) When we arrived home, I was quite poorly. And I remember I think I've got about 12 days before I've got to go to Africa. And I don't know how I got through it, but I did. And I did the time I wanted to do it in. So now it was back home to the UK, try to recover, do the last two marathons in this series. You're geting more and more tired, more and more prone to injury and fatigue, illness as well. You get very, very stressed out. You've only got one chance, and if something goes wrong, the whole thing's out the window. [Rich] On the morning of stage four of MDS, Fiona discovered that the soles of her shoes were disintegrating. The previous days of harsh terrain running on volcanic rock had taken their toll. They've just ripped to pieces underneath. And it's both of them. It just basically took the soles off. The tread just came off. They're not particularly built for hours and hours of climbing and descending in very, very hostile and hot terrain. They're built for road running. My shoes really didn't occur to me because I've tried and tested 'em for so many times. It didn't really occur to me. But that just shows you what this race is. It throw up things that you don't expect. As I say I've created a sole with this. And if you were then to get some gaffer tape to hold this in place or just keep putting gaffer tape around to give layers. Again if your shoes go, you go. You go home. There's nothing you can do. Mark down there is going to lend me some gaffer tape, and I'm gonna try and tape them and see how far I get. Well I've just gotta go out there and see what happens. Nothing I can do. (dramatic music) [Rich] Stage four of MDS also known as the long stage is the equivalent of two marathons back to back. Runners are given 36 hours to cross the 86.2 kilometers of dunes, dry salt lakes, riverbeds, and jebels along the route. Runners must push through the night to make bivouac four in time to avoid disqualification. In an effort to try to preserve her shoes remaining tread, Fiona decides to walk the entire stage with her fellow tent mates. (dramatic music) I've seen people drop out because they didn't hydrate enough, but to be honest, I've seen more people drop out because they didn't take care of their feet. It's the combination of the heat and the sweating of your feet and you know the roughness of the sand and sand getting into your shoes. It's like the perfect storm of why people are forced to drop out. (dramatic music) I stop at every checkpoint and wrap 'em till I've got some tread. I think the bags'll hold. It's just funny. It was a matter of going around the camp and trying to beg and borrow tape from people. I think any kilometer that the soles of these shoes are now protected is a win. It's just brutal. You actually are looking at 86 kilometers with a giant backpack in hostile terrain, hostile condition climbing, trudging. (dramatic music) The thing is it's not the last stage today. So even if you get through today on no shoes, you've got a marathon to worry about on no shoes. The whole stage it had to be weighted. What do you do? Do you hammer your shoes and try and get off your feet as quickly as possible but risk hammering 'em too much, so you can't actually enter the marathon stage? Or do you take it really, really easy, watch every step and try and nurse them home? (dramatic music) It makes you wanna cry because you know thinking you're gonna be out here doing this, and then I've gotta go through tomorrow. I'm just praying. (dramatic music) It's grim when you look at it and think right 86 kilometers. Even if you do a relatively decent pace factoring in stops, you're looking at a cozy 23 hours. (dramatic music) And it's literally going through checkpoint after checkpoint fixating on getting to a checkpoint. You just sit. Then it's body and equipment management. First thing before I was actually seeing to myself was looking at the shoes. (dramatic music) I was laying in bed last night sort of I'm not doing it. I'm not putting myself through that. The disappointment of having to go out there now knowing that you probably might have to pull out because of your shoes. (dramatic music) It's relentless. I mean you've just gotta keep moving forward. Demoralizing, you can't see the terrain. You can't see what's out in front, so you just have to rely on having enough strength to cope with whatever comes. (dramatic music) Night is just a different game to running at night as opposed to running the day. That's when the demons come to play at night. And they do play some fairly nasty tricks on you. So it's really hard. You've got to go dig really deep to get yourself out of some of the holes that your mind puts you in. And that requires extraordinary, extraordinary depth of character. (dramatic music) You know what an ox or a horse or donkey feels like being harnessed up. (dramatic music) And you know you're gonna be out there for a long time, and you just hope your body holds up. That's the main thing. You're just desperately hoping your body and your mind holds up. (dramatic music) (electronic ticking) Well we're just waiting for the taxi to come to take Fiona to the airport for what? - The annual egg and spoon. - Annual egg And spoon competition. [Martin] That's what you've been training for? Yeah. [Martin] That's not right. I think you're going to run across the desert. No, no, I think it's an egg and spoon competition. So you're telling me all you're training has been based around egg and spoon. Well yeah, we've got the egg and spoon here that we've been training with. [Martin] That's a pepper Peppa Pig egg and spoon set made of plastic. Yeah. [Martin] Well I'm sorry, but that's not right. You're gonna have to give those to me, and you're gonna have to put that backpack on and run across the desert unfortunately. We went off to South America, and I have to say if I'd have known what I was letting myself in for, I question whether I would've actually gone. It was so horrible. And I'm forever grateful that my mom actually went with me and witnessed it because if she hadn't, I don't think she would've believed it. The Atacama Volcano Marathon is extreme in a very different way to the ice marathons. It's one of the highest marathons in the world. So you start at 14 and a half thousand feet, and you've only got 11% oxygen. It's about what you'd have at sea level. And I'd convinced myself that it wouldn't be too bad running a marathon at 14,000 feet altitude. I really hadn't given it that much thought. Running at altitude I think especially for someone who comes from sea level is definitely a challenge. It is very, very extreme. I think more extreme and potentially more risky than the ice marathons. You've got to contest with the fact that you're running at altitude, but you're not kinda running. You're battling very, very bad terrain about 28 K. I rolled my knee on a stone or whatever it was I don't know. I just rolled my knee and slipped. I knew I'd damaged it badly the minute I did it. I just thought okay I'm gonna have to walk. I'm gonna have to do what I have to do to finish, and it's not gonna be pretty. And it really wasn't. If I'd have just been trying to do this for myself, I wouldn't have put myself through it. I have to say that. But I wasn't doing it for myself, so I did. (dramatic music) And I remember laying the back of this ambulance, 14,400 feet up the side of a volcano in the Atacama Desert thinking how the hell am I gonna recover from this? The doctor has just told me that I am not gonna run again this year. It was November, November 14th. How the hell am I gonna run in Antarctica in five days? Just complete silence, game over kind of thing. I couldn't even bend my leg. And we got back to the hotel mom and I. We just went back to our room and thought this is the worst nightmare that could possibly have happened. We got into Santiago, and I was pretty much panicking. And we went off to Antarctica. And I thought this is not possible. I was really scared. I just couldn't run. I just couldn't bend my leg. I didn't know what to do. I got all these expectations resting on me, guilt, fear. I got these world records. I'm doubtful whether I can do 'em or not. I've failed basically. (dramatic music) I just thought how am I gonna possibly keep on? It was very, very cold. I won't say I prepared myself for my run because I didn't think with this knee that was just constantly throbbing, and I was like severely depleted from the Atacama race anyway, and I was in a lot of pain which was very, very worrying. I'm just gonna run, shuffle, crawl, slide, whatever I've got to do. As long as the knee continues at this pain level and doesn't get any worse, as long as I can just block that out, I might be able to just keep going. You're so aware of treading this fine balance between something go wrong, and if it goes wrong, you've got no way of making it go right. You just can't, and it hits you really quickly. It really does hit very quickly. One minute you're running in fog, and the next minute it's just like some curtain's been drawn in front of you. It was absolutely majestic. Just the ethereal beauty of looking around you and seeing nothing and no one and like check this I'm in Antarctica, wow. As the kind of kilometers or miles tick by, I realize that I was beginning to catch runners. I don't know it was like a total epiphany. The Fiona that had been worried and in pain with the knee kind of left my body, and the spirit of a new Fiona came into my body, and it was like wow perhaps I'm not going that slowly. Perhaps it isn't completely out the window. Perhaps I can still salvage something from this race. Perhaps I can, dare I say break this record of being the fastest woman in actual running time to go to these continents, these extra two bonus world records. And dare I even dream it, I can win it. So it all kinda came rushing upon me all at once seeing the camp, seeing the gantry, seeing the finish line and more importantly seeing the tape being help across for the first lady home. (horn honking) (audience cheering) Broke the tape, nearly broke me neck 'cause I fell over on the tape and slipped. Very, very unlady like. I said oh did I win? That's the only thing. Did I win? And he said, "Yeah, yeah, you won." "And you even broke the course record." I couldn't actually believe it. (dramatic music) I still don't know how I did it, but I did. And yeah, that was my world record. (laughing) [Rich] Fiona Oaks set three world records, fastest aggregate time to complete a marathon on each continent, fastest aggregate time to complete a marathon on each continent and the North Pole, both cumulatively and elapsed. Stage five of Marathon Des Sables is the final leg of the race. At 42.2 kilometers, it is a marathon distance run and the second longest stage of the entire week. The course forces runners along painfully uneven terrain before sending them down into a deep, dry wash. After climbing out, they must traverse a long section of rocky plateaus and steep wind blown sand dunes. The course then passes through the ancient and abandoned village of Methis in the final stretch to the finish line. (sucking air) That really, really stung. 'Cause I know my toe nail's gonna come off. When it does come off, I don't want it to be loose in my shoe. Feeling nervous about today, but I think everyone in the tent agrees we're feeling pretty blessed to be in a position to be sitting here even considering going out there because in the beginning of the week getting to Friday does actually seem like a daunting prospect. In the beginning of the week, yeah, yeah whatever happens, I'm gonna crawl to the finish on my eyelids, you know. And then even yesterday when the long stage was over, people then start thinking oh my God what if something goes wrong in the night? What if I wake up with a cold? What if I wake up with the cramps? You know what if? All the what ifs because that long stage takes so much out of people that you don't want to have done it for nothing. And that was my main concern with the shoes. If worst outcomes it is a couple of stones and some plastic bags and some more gaffer tape, and you know whatever it takes. But let's say we hope it doesn't come to that. (dramatic music) People listen to Fiona talk, and they come to me afterwards and they say, "You must be very proud." And I say no. Pride reflects onto me. I look at her in awe, and then the guilt kicks in. The guilt at having brought a life into the world that is so compassionate and feeling and loving that she has to push herself to these tremendous lengths to try to get a platform so that she can speak for those who have no voice. (dramatic music) I've been very strong, but I am very, very sensitive. I abhor cruelty to humans and animals alike. I don't think that in the 21st century especially people should be suffering, and I certainly don't think animals should be suffering at people's hands. I can't turn a blind eye. It's not in me to do that. I always want to try and do the right thing and do as much as I possibly can whilst I'm here and able to do it. (dramatic music) (audience cheering) (dramatic music) (speaking in a foreign language) [Rich] Fiona finishes with a total running time of 46 hours, 31 minutes, 26 seconds in the top third of female runners. It's kind of mixed emotions when you finish. It's been the focus of your life for a long time before you came here. And for the last week, you've been fully aware that you're working toward this particular moment. And when it comes, it's not exactly a let down, but it's just I think to be honest with you, it reminds me more of relief. I'm all talked out about it now. It's done. It's over. I've done it. So it's move on and do something else now. Go home, feed my lambs. That's where I wanna be, so much I wanna be. So yeah, that's what it's all about. (dramatic music) Fiona, she's so pure. And she's just doing it like everything from her heart. She's not defined by a physical condition. She doesn't define herself by her extraordinary running. She does this completely selflessly. For her, it's for her passionate belief about veganism and about her animal sanctuary. Part of what makes her so incredible is that she's just so humble. Her life and her work with the animals with her sanctuary drives her, and it gives her a focus for her running. For so many reasons, I want Fiona to succeed in her running and her advocacy. I think sometimes people look at individuals like Fiona, and it's like oh they're super human. Maybe she does have some genetic abilities that have helped her, but she's got an incredible amount of will, and she's a great example for what you can continue to do throughout a lifetime. (dramatic music)
