Ugh. Ugh. Ahhhhhh! Thank God that's over with. I want you to take my body. You want me to do what!? It'll be fun... trust me. Ummm... Keep fishin' Brit, this one is mine - Sometimes. This time! Ok! I got the message - I'll catch you later. You too sexy fish. She... I know. Just remember who you really want. There she is. Yeah I see her! Avery Quinn! Stop right where you are! Oh God... Avery!... We've got eye on her... she's on foot..and she's armed... Come on. You ain't gotta tell me twice. Well, I doubt you can do twice but I'll take what I can get. Does she have to try to nail everything that moves? - What!? - Nothing! Let's go. Oh boy... Oh, no, no, no loverboy... its time to go- party is over... Come on Gwyn! We'll let you join in if you'd like. You can't handle me! Let's go! I better go too. You don't have to be good all of the time you know. Your dad hates me enough already. Stop worrying about what people think! That's easy for you to say. Just go - with your boyfriend! Help! Somebody please... help me... help... help me... help me... What the hell!? Somebody get locked out and shit themselves or what?.... You sure can pick 'em ladies... Standards, ladies. Standards. Let me in! Please! I think its some girl out there in her underwear but I can't - really tell. - Well goddamn! I say let that - bitch in! - Shut up, man. She might be - hurt. - Maybe we should call the police first? Police!? For a girl with her wail-tail flying? You don't need cops baby, you need Carter Reese. What if she left here earlier and got in trouble? That wouldn't be too good for Pi house, would it Gwyn? Nobody is calling anyone. Pi house will be fine. I'll handle this. One way or another... Help! See! What did I tell you!? When girls come to Carter Reese their pants just fall off! Hey. Let me help you baby. Oh shit! Close the door! Now! Ok... Lock it! Hurry up! I said lock the fucking door! Now! And get over there before I blow his goddamn head off! Want me to hold my hands up forever? You'll do whatever I say. Got it? Fuck you! Fuck me?! Fuck you! Understand me now? There are far worse things that can happen to you than your arms getting tired. Trust me. Now go! Everyone into the living room where I can see you. Now! What do you want? What do I want? What do I want? That's a good question So many things. I don't know. How about my last two days back for starters? A good pair of running shoes and comfortable pants wouldn't hurt either. But I - What do I really want? What do I want? That's what you want to know!? Is it!? Pi House. You think these girls have actually seen anything? It's the last night before Spring Break This party is legendary. The price of admission is enough to say the least. Well, I wouldn't let Sharon find out how you know about legendary Last Night. Can't imagine your dad would be too thrilled about it either. What do I want? What do I want? I want my friends back. I just want my Eric back. I just want them back. I just want them back. I can't believe he's real. Why did we have to do it! If we would have never done it, they'd still be here. Here. Let me help you. Help me!? How are you gonna help me Gwyn!? You know Dylan, I've been called multiple times to this estate for noise complaints. Yeah Miller, we're all aware of your enthusiasm when it comes to catching the noise complaint cases at the Pi House. A word to the wise - women always find out. Always. Don't forget that big guy. Oh, that's right, I know who you are you stuck up bitch. if you're stupid morning show wasn't enough, your picture's all over the place at GMU. How much did that cost you anyway huh? Must be nice to buy your way out of everything. If I can't do it, I'll just buy it. Just rich bitch Malibu Barbie living the American dream aren't ya!? You really think she'd crash this party? I mean. Too many witnesses right - it doesn't make sense - No it doesn't make any sense. but if anything strange is going on, Gwyn will know about it - nothing happens at GMU without Gwyn knowing about it. Besides, Olivia said she came this way so it's worth a shot. But enough of this getting to know you bullshit, let's keep it simple. - I didn't... - Ah, why so sensitive anyway Gwyn!? Did I hit a nerve? I don't wanna hear it! You can't buy your way out of this one. You can't help me. None of you can. Then what do you want? Just go. - Dylan? - Hmm? How do you know about the Pi parties. Experience buddy boy. Experience. Wow. Do not fucking move! Come on ladies. Ms. Prescott!? Ms. Prescott, its Sheriff Dylan and Officer Miller from Lake Hartwell PD. Alright, get rid of them - You go, too! And if anyone of you thinks about signaling them or calling out or even breathing too fucking loudly I'll empty every fucking bullet into them, take their guns, and shoot you all in the fucking head! You get me? Come on, ladies. Jesus Christ. Come on, ladies! Ma'am we're looking for a fugitive in the area, can you open the door please? You want me to knock? Shut up. Let's go! Come on! Ms. Prescott!? Tada! - Good evening, Ms. Prescott. - Good evening officers what can - I do ya for? - Ma'am not to alarm you, we're looking for a suspect in the area. Have you seen this woman? Uh, no I haven't Lucas, what has she done? It's possible she may have murdered five people at the old Granville house, you know, in the woods off highway 41. - You okay? - Yeah..yeah she's fine we're just, uh - that's shocking. Yeah it sure is. It's strange too. By all accounts she was... she was a good girl. Guess you can't really tell anymore these days with the damn reality TV, horror movies, sexting, and the uppers and downers they gotta take to deal with it. You know its a miracle we don't hear more often about some of our own just going snap, crackle and pop off the goddamn - reservation. - Sheriff! Sheriff! Sorry, sorry ma'am... Miss, have another look. A little harder. Jesus Christ, she's here! No, wait! Don't even think about it, hero. Throw your gun away! Throw it away! Get inside now! Into the living room. Alright, just... just take it easy. It's, it's Avery, right? Look. Just give me the gun and we can end this. Nobody else has to get hurt. Okay? Shut up! Everybody on their knees! I need to think! It was him. I thought it was just like a game an urban legend you know? A kid's story. Tick tock! Look. Avery. It's alright. Just give me the gun. Your friends were hurt tonight. They need our help. It's okay. We can help you. I didn't mean to hurt him. I didn't kill anyone else. I barley escaped, don't you get it!? Him who? What game? Yo! Are you kidding me with this shit!? This bitch is fucking crazy! Blaming some bullshit game!? - Shut up Carter! - She's fucking whacked! Shut up! Look, Avery, whatever you think happened it's okay. We can talk about it. Just give me the gun, we can help you. I'm the only one that survived. Don't you see? I don't know how to stop him. - Stop who!? - I don't know who or what he is. He comes in your sleep. Who comes in your sleep sweetie? The Sandman. Tick Tock. Oh, oh! Oh Freddy Kreuger did it!? Yeah, this twat's fucking crazy! That's enough Carter! - It's stupid bullshit! - That's enough! She's a killer! We all saw it! She's just trying to blame some fake-ass wanna-be boogeyman! The Sandman!? Yeah. Look, the insanity defense is a good one, keep going with that you crazy fucking bitch! - Shut up! - Fuck you! You think it's just a game? You think he isn't real? Its just my imagination? Then we're all gonna play a little game together. We'll see what scares you by the end of the night. So you want us to play a stupid game!? Its not a game! Its real! Tick tock. Then what do you want us to do? You. You take her and her and go find some candles and something to cut with. Let me go, just leave them alone. Shut up Ms. Perfect. No one better get a hero complex. I still got five bullets left. You three go! Now! Don't even think about moving. Keep your eyes open. Something strange is going on. This doesn't make any sense. Yeah you're damn right. A little girl like that killing all of those people? I can't believe it. Me either. Still. These kids these days. You know what, don't go all Lucas Dylan on me! Don't lose focus! Balls. It's just one girl. It's just one girl with a trail of bodies behind her. Yeah fair enough. - Ok, now what do we do? - Now we sit around for the next three and a half half hours watching our candles burn while this psycho cunt tries to figure out how to kill us all and escape. Meanwhile Barney Fife here and TJ Hooker outside get to die - heroes. - Shut the hell up, Carter. Fuck you RJ! No! Fuck you Carter this is your fault! My fault? She holds us at gunpoint and it's my fault!? It's your fault we even have to do any of this! Can you guys just take it easy okay? I'm gonna get us out of this. This is bullshit! Yo, just keep your candle lit and that's it! It's a fucking kid's game! Might as well be saying Bloody Mary in front of a goddamn mirror! No! That's not it! The midnight Man? This would be his greatest fear. You think you know. but you don't, but you will. You all will. First of all, you can forget whatever you think you know or saw in some shitty indie movie 'cause this ain't no game! This ain't no bullshit Midnight Man! This is real. The Sandman is real. Tick Tock! Tick tock! Hello!? Hey, hey. Crazy bitch! When all of the blood is on the paper, its time to invite the Sandman in. Once he's here, he's here until dawn. if you try to leave or turn on the lights, he'll kill you. When you see him, it's the last thing you'll see. And you better pray you survive and don't wake up. and all you can do is try to survive your worst nightmares and hope that you beat him. I thought you weren't supposed to fall asleep? No no no no no! That's what I'm saying! This is real! you have to beat him at his game! But what do you mean we have to try to survive our worst nightmares? Look at me. What do you think? He wants you to wake up so he can get you. Tick tock! Tick tock! And what if you don't? Oh then it's just easy! You just have to survive your worst nightmares. Oh, I fucking told y'all this bitch is crazy! Look, we're gonna be fine unless she shoots us, get fucking real! Shut up Carter! Fine! Sure! As long as you all keep your candles lit and stay asleep and survive your worst nightmares you'll be fine! How are any of us supposed to sleep? You don't have a choice! When he's here, you'll go to sleep and stay asleep as long as your candle is lit. What if it goes out? Avery! Get out! Go! The Sandman kills you as you sit unless you get your candle - re-lit in time... - Okay. - in time, in time. - Okay, alright. You know what, Carter's right, this is some bullshit! Complete bullshit! Bring me the paper! Light your candles. What now then!? Now I'll invite the Sandman. I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy! You'll see! I'm not crazy, okay. Sandman come to me tonight 'till morning's light, as darkness falls and shadows loom, I bid you welcome to my room, rest your bones beside my bed, your spell of slumber deep, and stay beside me as I sleep, If I die before I wake, I grant to you my soul to take. Now we wait. This bitch is nuts, and you fucking morons bought it!? I mean, we could have rushed her, taken her gun, and been halfway to Daytona by now but no. She doesn't have the guts to shoot one of us on purpose anyway. Would you shut up kid!? Avery, Avery, look at me. Why don't you just give me the gun okay? Look... I can take you down to the station, we can talk about whatever happened to you and your friends. It's ok. We can help you. It's okay. Sweetie, just, just give him the gun. We know that you didn't mean to do this. Maybe I am crazy. Just give him the gun! No! I'm not crazy! You'll see! He's coming! You'll see! I'm not crazy!!! THE SANDMAN: Tick tock. See. Nobody move. Did you see that shit!? We gotta get out of here. Where, where is she!? Avery!? She's fucking dead man! And we're all gonna be too if we don't leave! - Come on! Let's go! - Yo! You can't leave! Didn't you hear her?! Oh so now you believe!? Oh and you don't!? Yo, I believe what I saw! You know what!? You all can fucking stay if you want, we're leaving! That fucking thing's hand just went through her fucking chest I'm not standing around to be next! That's enough! You wanna live forever kid!? I'm sorry. No! Carter's right, I'm sorry... I'm staying... We're all staying! She's right! Just stay where you are, and and keep your - candles lit. - RJ just sit down please! So, are we just supposed to sit here all night!? I say we go! She couldn't have been right about everything! I mean she said we'd all be asleep right!? Right!? Do you really wanna test that? Do you? I'm in charge of each and every one of you! I say we stay right here and wait it out. We only have until dawn, right? Yeah! She's right! Just stay where you are. I can't even believe I'm saying this, keep your candles lit and we'll stick this out together. And don't forget. We're already playing the game. What!? Wait, excuse me, but am I the only one with a fucking brain!? Am I the only one who fucking saw that!? We all seen it! It's amazing how fast you change your tune. Big tough guy. Look at you now. Chicken Shit!! Chicken shit!? Yo, did you hear her!? She said we had to beat him at his game now, I don't know about y'all but I'm a fucking winner and I'm gonna walk out the door at the end of this night! Now, you can all sit here and sing Kumbaya, play tiddlywinks, or fucking jerk each other off for all I care. I'm taking me and my candle where none of y'all can fuck with it and waiting it out alone. and if any of you try to find me, I'll kill you myself. Kid!? Wait! Let him go. He ain't going anywhere. besides the first noise, noise that he hears he will be in here up underneath our asses pretending like we need he him. You know his type, all talk no action. I'm walking outta here tonight. I'm walking outta here tonight. I'm walking out here. Now, what are we supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for that thing to get us? No, if we stay together we should be fine alright? And keep your candles lit! Right. That's fine and I can do all of that, but I need to go to the bathroom first. No, you can't go. I'll be fine. Look, just, just take someone with you okay? I will be fine! All I have to do is keep a candle lit, pop a squat, tinkle and I'll be right back. Gwyn. You go girl! What the hell? Oh my God. Is this for real? I must say, if this is my worst nightmare, I don't want to wake up, it's pretty good! Okay. Get a grip! Still. Oh my God. Okay, that's enough! Open the door. Open the door. Can anybody hear me!? Open the door! I'm serious! Come on! Joke's over! Bo? Somebody!? Anybody!? She shouldn't have gone. Did you want her to piss right here!? Would you just shut up Brittany!? Your mouth just has to always be open don't it!? Just like your goddamn legs! You know what - fuck you! - Fuck you! - Both of you, stop! Everybody stop arguing alright! It doesn't get us anywhere and it's stupid! Look, I know this may be new for you guys but if we want to pull through with this you're going to have to work together! Now, that means we keep our shit wired tight! So, if you want to go to the bathroom you hold it and if you want to open your mouth, you don't! You keep your cool! I sure as hell am not dying in a goddamn sorority house tonight alright!? None of us are, okay! Look, we have to get Gwyn and that little douche bag back here and make sure they park their asses until the time is up! You, what's your name? RJ. Alright, RJ, look. You get your buddy and bring him back here. I will escort Ms. Prescott, okay. No. What!? I'm not moving. Way to pick 'em Erin! Look. I'm sorry alright. But you were right before. I mean y'all saw that thing, everybody saw it. I'm gonna stay here and make sure my candle stays lit. I'm not moving. You know what. I'll go. No, you shouldn't. Shouldn't what!? Go because I'm a girl!? Give me a break! At least take someone with you okay. I'll go! Okay, fine. Just stay together and come right back. Its across the house. We'll be okay! Don't go. I can't just sit here and do nothing, even if you can. Maybe my dad was right. I'll be right back. If anything happens, just yell like hell. Okay? No! - Jesus! - No lights, remember? I don't see him anyway. Why don't we just split up? Yeah cause that always works out in scary movies. All we have to do is keep our candles lit and we're - fine right? - Tick tock. Right. Oh my God you asshole! Asshole huh? We need to find Erin and get back to the circle. Did you hear me!? Okay! Easy tiger! We don't have time for that and if we did, you wouldn't know what to do with me. Okay. Gwyn? Ms. Prescott!? Hold on, I'm coming! Harder! You got me in the mood, now let's go! That's more like it! Okay! That's enough! We don't have a safe word, stop! Enough! Enough! I said that's enough! Why? Carter, let me go. Fucking asshole. Tick tock. No! No! No! Oh God No!...No!!!!!...no, no, no. Well, I'll be goddamned. What do we got here? Wha-what? What!? What the hell do you mean what!? You about knocked me the hell on my ass!

These little college whores just think they can come out here run all into anybody, do any goddamn thing they want - ain't that right Zeke!? Uh huh! I didn't mean to, I didn't- Come out here with her tits all bouncing, ass all hanging out. You know, this used to be our mama and daddy's place back before little whores like you came out here. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- You didn't mean to what!? Knock me on my ass? Come out here dressed like that. You trying to tease us? Is that what you're doing? That's exactly what she's doing! Coming out here bumping into my brother tits first, you know he can't take that kind of excitement - he's got a goddamn heart condition for fuck's sake! I'm sorry! Oh, now you're sorry!? Well, I think we got us a little girl that needs a lesson in manners like the way that mama and daddy used to teach it. Don't you? I like that idea. That's a fucking fantabulous idea! We gonna have you whistling zippity fucking doo dah out that sweet ass of yours when we're done with you. No! I just wanted to run! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Please let me go! Please. Alright. We don't like teasing, do we Hal? No. We don't. You're all ours now. We're gonna show you why little girls shouldn't be out here all alone.

What's the matter baby boy? Aren't you happy to see your old man? This can't be. Dad!? Wait, wait, wait. Jack?! Gwyn. Don't move Gwyn! What!? It's just your father, he's a legend. No, no... no. I see you still think you can control every man on the planet Gwyn. Jack, we need your help! I know what you need! But what are you prepared to do about it? - Trent, what's going on? I don't know, just, just stay behind me okay. What are you doing here kid? Is this what I taught you? Is it!? Is this what I gave up my life for? If you're gonna do something, you do your best or you stand down. It was one test dad! I will pass it next time alright!? I'm glad that your mother is not here, it's a disgrace to her memory. Did you ever think maybe I wanted something different for myself? When I was growing up my father used to say there were three things that really matter: Country, God and Family. Well, I don't wanna be him! In the first five minutes of combat you will find out more about yourself and everybody around you than you will in the rest of your life. Well, I'm not a soldier dad! And I'm not a hero like you and I don't want to be anything like you! Don't move! Hands up! Dad! I said don't move! Hands up Miller! Jake Beasley? I thought you were doing 25 to life. There's no pen that can hold me, not as long as you're alive! This is my son. I know. Dad! Dad, I don't know what to do, there's so much blood! I gotta call for help! No. You go get him. I can't leave you here - there's so much - - you're gonna bleed! You don't want to live forever, do you kid? Go... go. Dad!?...Dad!?...Dad!? Speak boy. Is that what I took that bullet for? No sir. - Is it!? - No sir! I can't hear you! No Sir! Look at you. Don't move, stand behind me. Who do you think you are? You think you're in control here? This can't be. You're dead. You'd like that wouldn't you? So I couldn't see that you let Beasley get away with it? No! No, I got my man - I - I brought him in. You got nothing! There's only one way to handle a psychopath and you didn't have the guts. It's pathetic! All these people - all these innocent people are dying- Stop it Jack! Trent, let's go! Let's get out of here! No, you run Gwyn. You remember Orwell? What did we say? Say It! People sleep peaceably in their beds because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf! Again! People sleep peaceably in their beds at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf! Good. You're getting better. Now listen, you're busy playing cops and robbers while all these innocent people are gonna die and it's all gonna be your fault. Hey, now, you don't wanna live forever, do ya kid? Tick tock son. Tick tock. Miller!? Miller!? Wake up! Come on! Snap to it! Miller!? Ms. Prescott!? You okay? What happened!? We seen something at the end of the hall. We both heard it! Then you just passed out. Are you okay!? Huh? Are you okay!? Yeah, okay. Come on, let's get back to the living room. Come on. Splitting up! What the hell was I thinking!? That never ends well. At last I still have my candle. Tick tock. Hello!? Who's there!? Get a grip! Jesus! Fuck! RJ! I thought you weren't gonna move? I came to find you. We need to talk. Here? Now? Yes! Here. Now. I have to find Carter. Fuck Carter! We need to talk. Okay, you've got me. I'm sitting here. Do I? Do you what? Have you? You're ridiculous! I don't have time for this- Keep your fucking ass in that fucking chair! Oh, you're gonna grow a backbone now? Fine. When you look at me, what do you see? - What do I see? - Yes! What do you see? Fine! You want this right here, right now? Fine! I see an amazing guy who can't get over his own bullshit hang-ups to be the man I want him to be. If you could just do that, you would be the man I want to be with all of the time instead of - this. That's what I see. That's what you see? That's what I see. Yeah, I know what you really see. Oh really? Why don't you tell me then? You see the same thing your daddy does every time he looks at me - Oh yeah? - Yeah! What's that!? A man who ain't ever gonna be good enough! And not because he isn't smart and not because he doesn't have potential, but because every time you look at him the only thing you see is a worthless-low-down-nigger. Erin - Hey!? RJ - Yeah! An athlete. A field hand who ain't worth noting more than an occasional good time for his daughter every time she wants to make her daddy mad! Damn it! I said tell me I'm wrong! What you said. Disgusts me. Does it!? Yes, it does. Why? Erin - Why? I wanna know! You're good enough for me RJ, more than good enough. But this fear you have, this constant worry about us and how people see you. That's your problem! Nobody ever spit in our face! Nobody ever told us we couldn't be together! Nobody ever told you that you weren't good enough! All of this shit is in your mind! And maybe that's because you're just- Just what!? It's because the only person that sees you as a nigger, is you! Erin!? Erin!? Come on! It'll be fun, trust me! Trust you!? Damn right trust me! Would I ever steer you wrong!? Yes. You totally would. - It's true. - Fine. Okay, but not this time! You're totally gonna dig it! You're gonna love it! Alright then. Guys, this is it? A kegger!? Seriously!? Until the orgy starts. No! I should really be studying, I have a world history test tomorrow! Oh my God. We are so not going to miss you. Tell me about it! Wait, miss me? What do you mean miss me!? I'm just glad we didn't have to carry her! Yeah for real, the box was heavy enough! Oh my god, you didn't even have to dig! Oh please, neither did you, that's what they're here for! You guys, what the hell are you talking talking about? Babe, beer! It's a surprise. I don't get it. You'll see. Wait no! No! No! No!!! No! No! No! Please!!!! Please... please. Carter? Carter! Carter! Damn it! Carter? Where are you? Carter! Tick tock! Jesus! That better not be you Carter Reese! Fuck it. Carter. Tick tock! Carter!? Oh my God! I got ya, didn't I? Bunch of scared little bitches. Yeah, we're the bitches. I can't believe I volunteered to come look for you, come on! No way! I told you guys, I'm staying here until morning and then Carter Reese is walking out that door. I can't come back without you, RJ is already pissed! Well I guess you're staying here, cause I'm not going! Stay here? - That's right! - With you? - Yeah, with me! - I don't think so! Come on! It's not like you haven't done it before. That was a long time ago Carter Reese, keep dreaming. No, this is your dream baby. Oh. Ah. Oh. Fuck. What the fuck!? - Dylan!? - Dylan hold on we're coming! Lucas!?

Too scared of what people might think? What do you think of this? Do you like that? I know I do! You want me, come get me. Erin? Carter? How? Why? Sorry bro. Did you really think she would be with you? Look at her and look at you. Look at me? Yeah, I mean bro... you're a little too tan if you... Tan!? Oh, RJ. Don't take it so hard, I mean... you said it yourself. You're nothing to me. Just a toy. A nigger to do whatever I need him to do. Nigger? Did I stutter? He is just a nigger, right? He is. You are. it is what it is, man. You were right about daddy. That's exactly how he saw you and what can I say. I'm a daddy's girl. But you can stay and watch us. And I guess that old saying was wrong because I went black. And I couldn't wait to get back. Gwyn!? Gwyn wake up! Gwyn! Wake up! Bo! Bo wake up! Can you hear me!? Jesus! Why won't they wake up? Tick tock! Don't move! I said don't move! Show me your hands. Dear God. Look at him. He's pathetic! Go! Just go, loser! As if I was ever a nigger lover. Inchoate. Run! Tick tock! - Please!

Carter? Tick tock. Carter!? Tick tock! - Carter!? - Bo. I don't know when I'm going to learn my lesson with you. So this is it huh? Unbelievable. So, you're just gonna get me out here, get me all ready to go, and what? Just leave me hanging? This because I went out with your sister? I only did that to get close to you. Make you jealous, you know I had no real interest in her. But I can see none of that makes a difference to you. No, this has nothing to do with me and your sister does it? No, it's all about you! All part of your disgusting need to fuck everyone you can as much as you can just to prove something to yourself. Isn't that right!? You'll do anything you can to hide how you feel about me from everyone! Your sister, your mom, your dad, your friends. From yourself. All just to hide the fact that you're gay!? Admit it! Be proud of who you are. - Admit it goddamn it! - That's enough! That's enough! I am so sick of this shit! You're just like everybody else! Just a self-righteous prick who wants everybody to do everything their way! You hear me?! I don't need to go around screaming or waving a flag just to know who I am. You understand? I don't need a month. I don't need a day. And I don't need a march just to validate me! You don't see my parents or my friends out there organizing straight pride protests or celebrations do you, huh!? You fucking hypocrite! It's different! No, no it's no different. You only think it's different because someone with an agenda used you and told you that it was different! Who or what I am is my own business! You hear me? It's bullshit! You're hiding! But, but you can keep lying to yourself. But what happens when you can't hide behind that arrogant lady's man you try to be and your secret gets out? If and when I want someone to know, I will tell them. But until then, nobody better find out. You hear me!? You better keep your mouth shut! Oops. Carter let me get a clear picture of you! Carter Reese, can you let us know how long you've known you've been gay? Let me get a clear picture of you! Are you bisexual or are you just paying women to have sex with you!? ...a picture of you and your boyfriend!? ...homosexual will hurt your father's business in the UK? My boy in there smoking pole! You said some ass was getting pounded tonight, you didn't say it was your ass! Good morning GMU wants an exclusive! I can see it now: Carter Reese from frat boy to fabulous! Does your girlfriend know you're queer!? How long have you been shagging men in parked cars!? Does Brittany know!? What about your sister!? Is this why the PI girls say you can't get it up!?
