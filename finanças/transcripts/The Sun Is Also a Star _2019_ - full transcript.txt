Carl Sagan once said that human beings are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it's forever. 13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang created the stars, the planets, the galaxies. Observable fact, rational thought, pure science. Perfect. The Big Bang also led to my home. New York. A city filled with humanity, dreams, loss... love. The choice we make. The path we choose. I always believed it would take a lifetime to understand the human heart. In the end, all it took was a single day. Dad? I gotta run. Accept destiny. Okay, um, I have my appointment at the immigration office at 8:00. Don't put yourself through that, baby girl. Give it up. We've been through lawyers. 'Tasha. We've tried for too long, Natasha Kingsley. We leave tomorrow. We're going home. But this... This is my home. New York is my home. I gotta run. Have a good day at school. â™ª Come, come, my baby come - Lester Barnes. - Natasha Kingsley. I... I set up the InfoPass appointment in order to retry my parents' case. Everything's in this file. Do yourself a favor, let me read it. Okay. Okay, here we go. Father's name? Samuel. Your brother? Peter. - Younger? - Peter's 11. Was he born in the U.S.? No. He was born in Jamaica. - We moved when he was four. - Any family members that are U.S. citizens? No. I've looked. When are you all set to leave? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Tomorrow. Okay. Your case is no longer under USCIS jurisdiction. What does that mean? Your removal is final. Sorry. So, there's nothing you can do? You know, I've been to Jamaica. It's a beautiful place. Everything there is irie. You know, you're gonna be okay. Yeah. Forget it. Hey, hey, hey. You're going to Jamaica. Some people are going to Gaza in here. Some people are going to Syria, Afghanistan. You're gonna be okay. Everybody tells me that I'm gonna be okay and I'm tired of it. 'Cause I've been here for nine years. I'm supposed to be going into senior year, focusing on AP Chem, and college and all of that. But instead I am here. And this is the last place I wanted to be. This is the last place, 'cause this is my home. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry, all right? Maybe there's something. Take this. That's a friend of mine, does some pro bono work. Jeremy Martinez. He's a lawyer. Call him. Hi, I'd like to set an appointment with Mr. Martinez today, please. My name is Natasha Kingsley. What is this regarding? My family is being deported tomorrow and we need his help. I'm sorry, Mr. Martinez is pretty booked today and... Listen, listen. My family - is leaving tomorrow... - Mrs. Kingsley... My family is leaving tomorrow. Can you please help me out? Can you? Please. Just this one time. I'm begging you. Please. All my parents ever dreamed about was to bring us here. Listen, I can give you 15 minutes at noon, which is his lunch. But that is it. Okay, that's all I need. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. My parents both went to college in Montego Bay. They met accidentally during a tropical storm. He ducked into a clothing store for shelter, and she was the store manager wearing a name tag and looking official. She never thought she could fall for such a romantic. But he was always reaching for the stars. Even if he had to fight to reach them. Deus ex machina. Daniel! I wanna help save lives and make the world a better place. Daniel! Okay, Umma. Today is so important, Daniel. It's the ticket to the rest of your life. I know, Umma. Lookin' like the one percent, little brother. Dartmouth is a very good school. Very good. - Good morning. - Mmm. What? I don't understand what you're saying, Mom. Hmm. Man, Dartmouth. Dartmouth. Good luck on your big interview. Huh? It's all on you now, Danny boy. One percent of what? Charlie forgot deposit slip again. Charlie? It's okay, Umma. I'll take it to him and Appa. After your interview. Then, straight to school. - No friends. - I won't. Do not be late. Yo, I can't tell if I'm riffing too much in this song or not. The line, it's, uh... Focus on the "we." It's... Or... - Second one. - Second one? Yeah, how you punch the "we"... - Right afterwards. - Yeah. You're gonna be the next big thing. Man, I'm not the one going to Dartmouth. I'm not in yet. Depends on today. Yeah, you got this, dude. Hope so. Hope so. Serious? MTA crushing it as always. We got a train delay at 68th Street. We're gonna be moving shortly. You might be panicking, but don't. Let me just say a little something for you. So, I take my daughter to school every morning. Me and my friend, Levi, we got overly in a conversation... We're taking the bus next time. ...which almost made our kids late for school. We get down to the subway and we miss the train. Shut up, asshole. And that particular morning, it just happened to be 9/11. Had Levi made that train, he would have been the one that goes into Manhattan because he worked at the World Trade Center. What I'm trying to say is, don't panic because of you being late. You never know why you were meant to be here at this time. Grand Central Station, next stop, ladies and gentlemen. Always remember to open up your heart to destiny. That was quite a story. Made me think, "Wow, he needs a therapist." Yo, I got some time before work. So, windows, yeah? His legs are the same size as the rest of his body. Shit. Well, there's your future. Right there. What, that guy dancing right there? No, you can't dance that well. Guy that's right there in the middle. He looks like everything was going well in his life and now, nope. Nothing. That's too bad. Poor guy. There's your role model. - The monk? - Yeah, the monk. He looks happier than everyone else. Yeah. I think we're missing something. Something's going on. Whoa. What? Her. It's just a cute girl, Daniel. I mean, okay. She's really cute, but... No one ever does that. What? Look up. Everyone is so busy looking straight ahead, they don't bother to look up. - Holy shit! - What? - Wait, where you going? - Her jacket. - Deus ex machina. - So? I wrote it this morning. It's Latin for "God from the machine." I don't know what that means. Open up your heart. What? Sorry, what are you talking about? Daniel, where are you going? Daniel! Open up your heart to destiny. Excuse me. I can't find her. Yeah, I don't see her. Wasn't meant to be. But, hey, man, you tried. I think I'm gonna see her again. I don't think so, man. I'll text you after my shift, okay? All right. Wish me luck. With the interview or the girl? Daniel. Text me when you come back to planet Earth, okay? The next stop is East Broadway. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. What the hell? Hey, he's okay. Here, take my water. I'm so sorry. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. That was close. Can I help you up? Thanks. Ow! Sorry about pulling you down. Can I ask your name? Natasha. I'm Daniel. You saved my life. Thank you. Do you want to sit down? I normally don't wear a suit. It's for my alumni interview for Dartmouth. No school today? Uh, no. No school. What's with the notebook? Uh... Just poems. Poems? Yeah, I just dabble in it for fun. Not a big deal, really. What are they about? Oh, no, no, no. Wait, let me guess. Love. - Not all of them. - But most of them? Yes. Well, I don't believe in love. It exists whether you believe in it or not. And that's a provable fact? Yeah. How could thousands of songs and poems be about something that doesn't exist? Boy, please! Words on paper. What would convince you? If you can't use the scientific method on it, then it's not real. Anything in this world that's a fact, it's a fact because we can either observe it, measure it, or experiment with it. If you can't do any of those things, then it's legit, deadass not real. But you gotta admit people are feeling something. Hormones. They're feeling hormones. And we just call it love, so that we have something grand to live for. Otherwise, life seems really mundane and just a random series of events that you have no control over until you die. Depressing, right? You make it sound depressing. Because it is. So, no magic, no fate, no "meant to be"? What if I told you I could get you, to fall in love with me? Scientifically. How is that humanly possible? Just give me a day. One day. Today. I can't. I don't have a day. Do you have an hour? An hour. I'm not changing my mind, though. No. My appointment's at noon and I'll be home right after that. Your mother is worried sick. You have to come pack your stuff. Dad, this lawyer might be able to help. Stop being such a stubborn child. And get home now. Please, we have to do something. This is honestly our last chance. Come pack your stuff. I'm gonna throw it all in the trash. Will you please just listen to me for once? - Hello? - Is this Daniel Bae? Yes, this is Daniel Bae. My apologies, but Mr. Martinez needs to reschedule our interview. - Reschedule? - Tomorrow morning, 8:00. Yeah! I think I can make that work. Okay. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Uh-huh. See you then. Yes! Hey. What was that all about? - Just parents being parents. - Hmm. Loosened your tie. Yeah. Uh, my interview got postponed to tomorrow. But back to love and science. So, this study had researchers put a bunch of couples into a lab and had them ask each other a series of intimate questions. Sounds ridiculous. At the end of the study, they had to stare into each other's eyes for four minutes without saying a word. So, you think you're gonna make me fall in love by asking me these questions? Okay, so there are 36 questions. Okay, so we're doing this? But nobody's got time for all that. So, how about I pick ten randomly? Okay, question number one. What are the five key ingredients to falling in love? This is so idiotic. Um... Fine. Uh... Mutual self-interest and socioeconomic compatibility. Okay. Well, my ingredients are friendship and chemistry. Mmm. Of course they are. My last three are some sort of moral compass... Common interests are a must. And let's see, the X factor. What in the world is the X factor? Don't worry. We've got it. You know what... I hate to break this to you, but taking this little quiz isn't gonna make me change my mind, Mr. Plaid Tie. Did you just call me Pad Thai? Plaid Tie. Because not only is that completely racist, but also culturally insensitive as my family is from Korea, not Thailand. Well, that is not what I said, so you can stop waiting for an apology. Oh, I'm waiting for something, but not for an apology. Where are you going? I told you I have a meeting. Uh, we still have 27 minutes left. Mmm-hmm. So, you coming or what? So, where do you see yourself in five years? Is that actually one of the questions? I might be improvising. Well, I want to be a data scientist. What's that? It's a scientist who analyzes data. We take large amounts of information and strategize on how to apply it practically. Like how? Like traffic flow, four-day work weeks for big companies, personal time versus productivity. All that jazz. Come on. You're passionate about it, though, right? Yeah, well, I'm passionate about walking on the moon. But I can't live off of passion any more than I can live off of love. It's a long life to spend doing something you're not really into. It's a long life to spend chasing dreams. You should really kick it with my dad sometime. Am I reminding you of a 50-year-old Korean man? Without the accent. So, he's not crazy about you pursuing poetry? Oh, no. I'm first-generation. And? It means it doesn't matter what I want. According to my parents, I'm meant to be a doctor. Oh. You know, at least when you're a doctor making bank, you can thank them for not letting you be a starving artist. It's hard to be passionate when you're hungry. This is me. You're kidding. This is where my interview was supposed to be. Come on. Honestly? I'm serious. What are you doing here? Personal. Okay. But you gotta admit, this definitely proves my point. Fate is real. Wait, I think you mean coincidences, 'cause they can happen without meaning. Okay. Okay. I'll wait here for you and then we'll finish the questions. Daniel, I should really go home right after this. Today is a big day. So, I think this is where we say goodbye. Um... Am I gonna see you again? The odds aren't in your favor. I'm guessing 1 in 8 million. I really think I could have changed your mind if I had the whole day. Too bad you couldn't prove your hypothesis. It was nice to save your life, Natasha. Nice meeting you, Daniel. You know, good luck with everything. Honestly, I hope the interview goes well. Figure all that out. Thanks. Thanks again. You know, I'm gonna prove my hypothesis! Love is real. This isn't the last time I'm gonna see you. If I gotta hit up all the boroughs, we're gonna see each other again. You can't stop what's meant to be. The Theory of Multiverse was set forth originally by Hugh Everett in quantum mechanics. It posited that every version of our past and future histories exists, just in an alternate universe. This means that for every choice you make, an infinite number of universes exist where you made a different choice. In this way, we get to live multiple lives. I'm not quite sure which universe I'm living in now. Law offices of Jeremy Martinez. Perfect. Okay, thank you. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, I'm Natasha Kingsley. I was just about to call you. I am so sorry, but I have some bad news. Mr. Martinez was biking in to work when he got clipped by a car. But he was lucky. Just a few bruises. He'll be back around 4:30. Can you come back then? Law offices of Jeremy Martinez. Of course. Of course. Um, I was supposed to help my mother but I'll be here. Great. I need you to fill these out. I already have my case files. You still need to fill these out. You can take a seat right over there. Okay. How can I help you? "Have you ever been convicted of a crime?" Hey, get back here! "Are you willing to offer allegiance "to the United States of America?" I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic... "Have you ever been involved "in anti-government activities?" Protect kids not guns! Protect kids not guns! "What does America mean to you?" Flip your hair a little bit. We've had a lot of cases like yours recently. I think Mr. Martinez may be able to help you reopen your case. Honestly? I can't make any promises, especially these days. But be back 4:30 sharp. - Hey, Tash. - Oh! Hey. Doing nicknames now? Yeah. How'd your thing go? Uh... I have to come back at 4:30. I guess that just gives you four hours to just hang out with me or... I mean, I should still go home. Okay, yeah, how long does that take? 45, 50ish minutes? One way? Yeah. That's like two hours. Just to be home then turn around? Okay, you make some fair points. Yeah. So? I have, uh, this thing uptown. My parents. - Your parents? - Yeah. I just gotta drop something off. It's not a big deal at all. Do you wanna come? - I'm sorry. - For what? I'm sorry this isn't exactly the sexiest first date. Never agreed it was a date. Oh, it is. You'll see. I wish I could just bottle your confidence and sell it. 'Cause I'd make a shit ton of money. I'm not that confident. Okay. This is it. - This is your family's store? - Mmm-hmm. Your family, the South Korean immigrants, own a black hair care store? Yes. My family of South Korean immigrants do own a black hair care store. Passion project? It seems random, but it's not. See, in the 60s, wigs made from South Korean hair were extremely popular. Around that time, the South Korean government banned the export of hair, making it difficult for anyone other than Koreans to make wigs. Then the U.S. government banned wigs made from Chinese hair. This gave Koreans full control over the entire wig industry and the wig business evolved into the more general black hair care business. Which, South Koreans currently control 60 to 80%. Aisle one is shampoos, conditioners, dyes, a bunch of other things that I don't understand. Aisle three is weaves, uh, wigs... Wow. This place is huge. Uh, can I get you anything? I think I'm set on gel, but thanks. No. No! Uh, I didn't mean a product. Uh, my dad's got a fridge in the back with like soda and... Mmm, got it. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. - A soda would be great. - Mmm-hmm. Pink? Why not? Doesn't seem like your style. You never know what might work. Hmm. Mmm-hmm. I think you'd look beautiful with a giant, pink afro. Well, not the whole thing, just the ends. - Cool. - Yeah. Your hair looks really soft. You think it can take all that dye? Well, you're the black hair care expert. So, why don't you feel it and tell me? Really? It's a one-time-only offer. Aw! What's going on here? Uh... Oh, God. This is my older brother, Charlie. This is my friend, Natasha. Friend? Oh! I thought maybe he just caught a shoplifter. What did you just say? Hey, we get a lot of those in a store like this, right? - I'm sure you understand. - Wow. What the hell is your problem? What? What? - Tough guy in a suit now. Huh? - Daniel, let's just go. Don't touch me. Let's go. Go. Oh... Appa. The money pouch. Oh... Hey, want me to translate for your friend, Danny? Uh... Hi, Mr... - Bae. - Mr. Bae, I'm Natasha. You're a friend of Daniel's. Would you like something before you leave? What, for free? Not this aisle. Come with me. Ah. Relaxer for your hair. Make your hair not so big. Thank you, Mr. Bae, but I like my hair big. Oh, if you like big, you should get yourself a man, 'cause little Danny here... Yeah, 'cause my dick is an inch long, still twice as big as yours. I gotta go. You know, it could not have gone any worse. What a combo. I mean, maybe I should have gotten the relaxer just to make him like me more. I'm glad you find this funny. Dude, tragedy is funny. Sometimes you gotta laugh to keep from crying. Are we in a tragedy? That's what life is. You know, we all die in the end. Hey... I'm sorry. Daniel... you're not your dad. And you're for sure not your brother. And they shouldn't be mad at you because of me. They should be mad because you stole all the good looks in the family. Thank you. I still have three hours. So, where to? I have one of my favorite spots. Okay. - Soccer. - Really? Yeah. All I hear is the ball, like, thudding on the ground. It doesn't even make any sense. 'Cause soccer, isn't the ball supposed to stay on the ground? Yeah, I mean, unless you kick it. Wow. Thank you for bringing me here. Makes you feel minuscule and so important at the same time. Passionate about it, you should be an astronomer. No, but really, though. But you love it. Change is a constant in the universe. Stars, planets, even galaxies, are always on the move. Tugged this way and that. By the powerful, ever-present force of gravity. At times, they even collide. This may sound alarming, but collisions can actually be beneficial... and sometimes beautiful. - Okay. - Next question. Hmm. Okay. Perfect timing. - Where are we going? - Noraebang. - Uh, in here? - Mmm-hmm. Korean karaoke. No, I'm not doing it, Daniel Bae. I'm not doing it. You know, in Noraebang you don't choose the song. The song chooses you. There goes that overly dramatic poet again. - Glad you recognize. - Yeah. Do you know what I recognize? I recognize that almost every poem I've read is about three things. Love, sex, and the stars. Stars are important. Didn't we just learn that - at the planetarium? - Sure, but... I don't know. Why not more poems about the sun? The sun is also a star. Just 'cause it's the most important star doesn't make it poetic. The sun is a benevolent star. A giver. It's our greatest symbol of hope. That's worth writing about. Fine. I'll only write poems about the sun from now on. Thank you. And sex. Gotta be ready in case the song calls for it. Good morning, everyone. The star explosion schematic view. Today is not a coincidence. It led me to you. - I gotta go right now. - What's wrong? These dreams are screwing up my entire life. I can't do this. Natasha! Natasha, what's wrong? Natasha! Natasha! Just wait! Natasha! What just happened back there? Just talk to me. What are you so afraid of? Hmm? What are you so afraid of? Of being late to my appointment. Or are you afraid of this? I know this is real. And I know you feel it, too. Natasha... Daniel, I know you think that us meeting is fate or destiny or whatever, but it can't be real, because I'm probably never gonna see you again. What? Why not? Because I wasn't born here. Because my family is being deported tomorrow. You're leaving tomorrow? Yeah. For good. You're just making it harder, Daniel. But there's gotta be something we can do. Just wait, Natasha, just wait. There's gotta be something we can do. I'm right here. I'm not a dream. Okay? I'm right here. Stay. - Thank you for saving my life. - Natasha. - Natasha. Natasha! - No. Leave me alone. I don't even have your number! Hi. Perfect timing, Miss Kingsley. Follow me, please. He's a little banged up after the accident, but extremely dedicated to his cases. Yep? Mr. Martinez, this is Natasha Kingsley. Thank you. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for squeezing me in. - Sorry. - No, it's okay. Please sit. I've had a chance to review your file and, uh, what I'd like to do is see the judge who issued this removal order, okay? I went to school with him. He's a good guy. And he'll be able to stop the deportation? Well, he might let me file a motion to reopen the case and then we can reverse this voluntary removal. All right? And then, at least you won't have to leave tomorrow. And I should have an answer from the judge in the morning. And then probably we should meet again. 10 o'clock all right with you? Okay, uh, well, then what? Well, then I'll ask for a new trial and submit a petition for permanent resident status. Okay? How's that sound to you? Like somebody finally cares. Hey, you're back early. You finished with the interview already? What happened? You can tell me. You can tell me anything. Why the long face, man? Shut up, Charlie. So, how did your fancy college interview go, Doctor Bae? Hmm? We finally got a doctor in the house? Someone to be proud of? Oh, come on, you really got nothing to say to me? No, Hyung. I don't. Hey. I told you not to call me that. Oh, shit, you're right. Someone might find out you're actually Korean. You think that little black girl made your balls grow? Huh? Oh, no, you're the little bitch who can't think for himself without their approval. Yeah, that's what you are. Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry not everybody can be as badass or edgy as you. Staying at home, eating their food, breaking Mom's heart. Fuck you! You think you're better than me? Hmm? - Just let me ask you... - Yeah. I'd do her, afro and all! You... Get some ice for your lip. Doctor Bae. Doctor Bae. Doctor Bae. - Doctor Bae. - Doctor Bae. - Are you okay? - Yes. Forget about Charlie. The only thing that matters is your interview. And you go to good college, you become doctor, you be success. What if I don't want the same things you and Umma want, Appa? Daniel, it is about the family name. It's about honor for all of us. But what about what I need? "I, I, I." America is all about "I." You do not throw away your future. Appa! If you do not go to college, you're on your own! "Yeah, Appa." "Yeah, Appa." Daniel! When my mother, Min Soo, fell in love with my father, Dae Hyun, she didn't expect it would take them from South Korea to America. When my mom and dad learned that they were going to have a baby, they struggled with what to name it. See, in America, the family name is called the last name. My father said it showed that Americans think the individual is more important than the family. But in Korea, the family name came first and told the entire history of your ancestry. When my brother was born they picked an American name, followed by a Korean personal name, followed by the family name. Then a couple of years later, they named me. So, in the end, they chose both. Korean and American. American and Korean. That way, we would know where we were from and where we were going. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Mmm. You look great. Thanks. Your boy's not here. Yeah, I know. I need his number. - You need his number? - Mmm-hmm. - From me? - That's what I just said. Danny's number? From me? You gonna give it to me or not? What's your deal? You have an Asian fetish or something? I just have something really important that I need to tell him. You really like him, huh? Yeah, I do. Here. Thank you. Yeah, okay. You're welcome. All right. Great. Great. Yep, all right. Hey. Don't break his heart. Hello? Hey. Natasha? Hi. How'd you get my... Your brother gave me your number. My brother gave you my number? I have it and it's me. I have some good news. Can you meet me? Yeah. No, yeah. Where are you? - Lightning round. - Okay. What is your most treasured memory? - Oh. When we first got here... - Mmm-hmm. ...my dad took us to see the fireworks at Coney Island. We ate fried dough, went on all the rides. Just kind of magical. Is that cheesy? - He was different then. - Your dad? Yeah. He's the reason we're here, but it's not even his fault. No, it's not his fault that ICE does these random raids. And he was working in the kitchen that day. Nine years here, then boom. Man, I'm sorry. It's all sorts of complicated. God, I love this city. Don't fall. I got him! I got him! Day's sweetest moments are at dawn. Good morning. I could get used to waking up like this. - Thank you. - Hmm. My bangs are probably everywhere. Any more questions? Kiss me? What time is it? - Uh... - You don't wanna miss your interview. - Oh, shit. It's 7:15. - Hmm! Oh, we gotta go. - Come on. Come on. - Yeah. Yeah, it's interview time. Come on. You got everything? Come on, come on. Yeah. Careful. Careful. What? I don't know. You're going in there, you're gonna kill this interview and I'll wait here for you until my appointment. You're good. Are you okay? - What if I have to leave? - You're not leaving. - How do you know that? - Because I know. The universe wants us to be together. You're not leaving, Natasha. Don't you see? That's what this whole thing is. Even your jacket, deus ex machina. It's fate. So you have nothing to worry about. Okay. Come on. You're gonna be late. Go, go, go. I don't want to go. Go! You promise you're gonna be here? I'll be here. We'll finish the questions when you get back. - Go to your interview. - I'm going. I'm going. Hi, Mommy! No, I... I'm so sorry. I should have reached out. I'm safe, though. No, no, no. I graduated a long time ago. Class of '92. Are you a Queens boy? - Yep. - Yeah, me, too. Your mother's name is Min Soo? Yes. - Pretty, pretty. - Thank you. Yeah. Soccer team. Forward. Must be fast. Asian Culture Club vice president? Mmm-hmm. Yes, sir. Excellent interpersonal customer service skills. What's that? Yes, sir. My, uh, father owns a black hair care store. I work there part-time. Any community service, that type of stuff? Mmm-hmm. I volunteer at the children's hospital in the Bronx twice a month. It's rewarding. I write poems with the patients. Takes their mind off of being sick. Oh, so you like to write, huh? I do. I do. As a hobby. Yeah, yeah. No, I feel like doctors should all be well-rounded, but, you know, it's rare. So, um... So when did you first know you wanted to be a doctor? Never. Is that an okay answer? Yeah, I guess. If it's honest. It is. All right. Well, let's go with that then. My parents want me to be a doctor. I never wanted that. I just... I want to be a poet. So why the hell do you wanna go to Dartmouth? Uh, my parents are immigrants. All they want is to give me and my brother a better life. It's all they ever wanted. But what about what you want? Doesn't that count for something? I don't know. Okay. There's still a chance, Mom. Will you please just listen to me for once? All I'm saying is I'm here. I have this appointment. Give me an hour. - Miss Kingsley, you're early. - Hi. Is he in there? - Yes, he is, but... - Okay, great. - I'll be home in an hour. - Hey, excuse me. I'm hanging up now. Goodbye, Mom. Your appointment's not until 10. Miss Kingsley you can't go in there. He's in a meeting! So sorry for the interruption. Excuse me. We're having a meeting here. - Tash? - Daniel? Destiny. What's going on here? This is... Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. You're fine. It's fine. We were just finishing up. No, we're not. We're just getting started right now. Can you tell me what happened with the judge? I don't think you wanna be talking about this in front of Mr. Bae right here. You can say anything in front of him. Just tell me. Can my family stay? No. I'm sorry. So you're saying I have to leave today? Natasha, if there was anything I could have done, I'm telling you, I would have done it. You said you could fix it. I promised to try and I did. I really did. Oh, your promises don't mean shit! Look, the current political climate, and the way they keep changing policies... - I mean, I did all I could. - You know what's so messed up? I'm so sorry, Tash. I'm so sorry. You said this wasn't gonna happen! You promised me - this wasn't gonna happen. - So sorry. Natasha! Hey! You didn't finish your interview. Natasha only has a few hours left. I'm not wasting another second. Don't you want the recommendation? Not more than I want the girl. Natasha! Natasha! Natasha, come on. Natasha, please. - Wait, wait, wait. Just wait. - I can't wait! - Wait. - I can't wait. I have to go home. I have to pack. I have so much to do. I can help. I can help. No, my parents are there. Go back to your interview. - Go back. - I don't care. I don't care about Dartmouth. It doesn't matter to me the way that you do. You met me yesterday! - Get over it! Get over it. - I don't wanna get over it. But you should! - But you should. - I'm not gonna get over it. No, no. Here's what we're not gonna do. We're not gonna act like this isn't the worst thing on earth, 'cause it is. Okay? But I'm coming home with you. I'm gonna see where you eat, where you sleep, where you live and I wish I could have done it sooner, but now is better than never. Are you okay with that? I just don't wanna go. I just don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go. I don't wanna... It's okay. I look homeless. You don't have to be nervous. I'm meeting your parents. Well, I mean, the good thing is, you can screw up all you want. Never gonna see 'em again. Pass me that one there. Lord, Natasha! Peter, go turn that damn music off. We didn't know when you'd come home. Uh, mommy, this is Daniel. Sorry to meet you under these circumstances, Mrs. Kingsley. Mmm. Dad, I'm sorry that I stayed out. He's the reason why you not come home last night? - Mr. Kingsley, it's my fault. - Not a word, boy. We've been up all night. Thinking about you, worried about you. And you've come home with this stranger. Daniel's not a stranger. He's my guest. Your guest? When you have your own home, you can have a guest. But this here's my home. What makes this your home? A home is a place you fight for. You don't even wanna stay. It's not simple, 'Tasha. What is it? I just wanted to give you all so much more than this. I love you. But we are leaving. Okay. - Thank you, sir. - Here's your bag. I don't know how to say goodbye. Then don't. We still have one more test to go. The stare. Four minutes. No talking. Ready? I'm not sure if we're supposed to hold hands during this part, but the hell with it. It's all right. I'm right here. Carl Sagan once said that human beings are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it's forever. Compared to the lifespan of the universe, our lives begin and end in a single day. I've come to understand it this way. The stars aren't just balls of gas burning billions of miles away. They are also a reminder of the brief time we share on this planet. At first, Daniel and I stayed in touch. But time and distance are the heart's natural enemies. May each day be today. Everyone we meet... ...everyone we love... how we got here... what path we choose... and who we choose to remember. They are all a part of our story. But we cannot allow the story to be written for us. Because we don't have forever. Sometimes... all we have is a single day. I'm Daniel. You saved my life. Thank you. I love you, Daniel Bae. I guess the experiment worked. Uh... Sorry I'm late. No, just... Thank you for coming. Yeah. So you found your way back to New York City, huh? Wasn't easy. As you know. But my student visa finally came through for grad school. So what are you studying? Astronomy. Um, I'm actually flying to San Francisco tomorrow to start my PhD at Berkeley. Thank you. Dr. Natasha Kingsley. Look at you. Thanks. But I need to ask you a question. Yeah, sure. So, the day my family got deported, there was a boy, Daniel Bae, who came to your office to interview for Dartmouth. Okay. I haven't been able to find him anywhere. I mean, he's not online anymore. It's literally like he's vanished. And I was wondering if you have any way of contacting him. No. No. When he ran out of my office, that was the last time I ever saw him. I'm sorry. I'll tell you something. You know why I remember that day? - Hmm. - Well, because I had a million things to do that morning, and I had this accident, right? And I actually tried to convince the EMTs not to take me to the hospital. But I was glad they did. Why? Well, because... my doctor became my wife. Yeah! Oh, my God! I know, I know, I know. So, you know, sometimes you can't control everything... I don't know. I don't know. Maybe just being open to fate, maybe that's a choice. Maybe. Uh... Good luck with everything. I mean that. - Thank you. - Okay. That's it for me. We've got some more talent coming out, so just sit tight. This is a poem I wrote about the sun. Natasha. Wow. How? I like your glasses. I like the hair. I leave tomorrow. I only need a day. Mmm. Well... I don't really have a day. Give me an hour.
