Daughter-in-law, when is Mahesh coming from Baroda? Today, uncle Sukhilal. Listen, some loaves of bread are left. Take them home. [COW MOO] Sheela! Hey Silli! Why were you outside? I was feeding bread to the cow. Breads aren't for free to feed the cow. You hail from pauper's house, but are giving alms here. Wow! Uncle Sukhilal, why did you keep the bread back? If your mother-in-law sees you, she'll whack you, dear. In this house you can't even feed animals. You eat it, daughter. Eat it. Silli, eat the stale bread. Don't give them to the servants. Keep fresh breads for the evening. No, no, daughter-in-law. One shouldn't get up while eating. - Eat a morsel of stale bread, dear. - No. I'm not hungry. For my sake, daughter-in-law. - Uncle Sukhilal! - Eat your food. Silli! I can't find my keys. Just see where I've kept them while eating. [SOBBING] I can't find it. I've checked everywhere. Have your meal, daughter-in-law. You! I told you to look for keys. What's the rush to eat? I couldn't find the keys, mother-in-law. Get up! Let me check you. - I don't have the keys. - Get up. Let me check. Get up! No, mother-in-law. I don't have the keys... [KEY'S JINGING] Aunt, look. Keys fell from your dress. Shut up! Why are you meddling? Leave if your work is over. Come back in the evening. Mother, maybe you forgot the keys after keeping them there. Shut up! Shameless! How dare you argue with me! I know. You're always eyeing my keys. I know very well. You and your husband don't like... ...mine handling all the responsibilities here. But remember. Because of me you get food to eat. Eat! Feed yourself to death! Why aren't you eating properly, daughter? You didn't eat properly even at noon. What is it? I can't eat tasteless food. Even after so many days she can't do household chores. Someone should've taught her. The way I taught you. Everybody is useless in her family. One can't eat this food. It's so bland. Come on. Serve some curry. Mother-in law, you? What are you looking at? Serve me some curry. I don't think his food satiated anyone's hunger. What are you staring at? Go away! Go! Make our bed. Come, daughter. Now eat properly. I wasn't destined to get a good daughter-in-law. You did great by sending her away. Whenever she's in front of me, I can't eat anything. Here. - That dish is good. Give me. - Sure. Here. - Yes. You too take it. - Eat. - Want it? - No. Ate your food? Yes. Water can't satiate hunger. Where are you going? To bring some food from the market. You can't sleep on an empty stomach. I wasn't really hungry. You've to suppress your emotions. Have you learn to suppress hunger too? You love me so much. I don't want anything else. With the husband's love, a wife gets the strength to endure. But husband too should've strength to... ...give rights to his wife. I don't even have that strength. I've not given you any happiness. - Who told you I'm not happy? - I can see everything. I feel like taking you away from here. But I promised father not to leave mother alone. That's why I'm quiet. Even you've to tolerate a lot along with me. Mahesh, where you're going so late in the night? To the market. No need. Come here. Check the account. I didn't get the time. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Prakash, Your clothes are ready. Where should I keep? Sister-in-law, why are you doing this? You already have so much work. Since you came to this house, you got only problem. I got husband like your brother... ...and a brother-in-law like you. Sister-in-law, you're so kind hearted. Mother always tortures you. But you always smile like a wounded soldier in a war. The day I become lieutenant I'll take you and brother along. Uncle, I'll also come with you. I want a train. I'll send train for my Veena as soon as I reach. Run! - Prakash. Are you going? - Yes, brother. Holidays are over. Now duty. Have you seen the girl? No. - Why? What happened? - Same thing, Sheela. Before I see the girl... ...our mother's notoriety reaches them. Then how brother-in-law get married? Sister-in-law... Even after knowing everything... ...why do you want to bring a girl in this hell? Someone might come to turn it into heaven. Mother-in-law wants you to get married soon. No, sister-in-law. She doesn't want my marriage, but dowry. No decent family will get their girl married in this house. Tales of our mother's atrocities are spread everywhere. Criticise. Criticize your mother. - No, mother. That's not so. - Shut up. You can't do anything. I've got you married, but this unfortunate gave me... ...a burden by giving birth to a girl. You can't find a girl for your brother. My son-in-law Lalla Kupchand will do this work too. He had seen a girl. She's from a rich family. - We'll get 50,000 rupees in dowry. - But mother... - ...where is the girl from? - How does that bother you? Even junk comes handy sometimes. But both my sons are useless. Lalla cares so much for this house? We get such a son-in-law with luck. [LIQUID PURRING] [DRUM PLAYING] "Look, how great my darling is." "He gets restless at nightfall." "He doesn't want me, but his needs." "After completing his work..." "...he walks away." "Very clever. My sweetheart is very clever." "My sweetheart is very clever." "He makes me dance whole night."

I think you're plotting some dark plan. What are you talking? No, no. Your charm has the power... ...to spread light everywhere. [BIKE ENGINE REVVING] You betrayed me! [SIGHS] Idiot. Characterless. You should be ashamed, madam. First see who has pulled your veil. Hit him. Hit him too. I am... I'm really very sorry. Okay. Let's go. Bus has arrived. Ok. 3554012. Oh no! Not this one. Bring this one. Oh God! This doesn't have number. You're destined to get rich. But whose hand is this? It's not mine. Sir, when did you come? I was calling you for long, but you're busy in lottery tickets. - Hit a jackpot. - No, sir. Actually these days my luck isn't with me, but on leave. Along with tickets, you'll get leave too. Got it? - How much did they cost? - 21. There was a bumper draw of 700,000. 21. You'll not reform. If you win the lottery, what will you do with so much money? What will I do? Engagement and marriage quickly. Is it? Found a girl or did you like one of these? No, sir. I like these girls but only half. The girl I'll marry will have nose like Hema Malini. Her eyes like Zenat Amaan and lips like Rakhi... I want an all-in-one girl. To fulfill this dream you've to win a lottery. Yes, sir. But my motto in life is to keep trying ... ...till I get success. I'll get success sooner or later. It'll be better if you get it before old age. - Yes, sir. - Ok. - Is my uniform ready? - Yes, sir. It's ready. - Bring it to my room. - Yes. - Is room open? - Yes. Sir. - If you don't mind can I ask you something? - Yes. It seems to be swollen. Do you've toothache? No. What do you mean? Someone might have given a wrong salute. Totaram, you'll not understand this. This is a result of standing in a wrong queue. Got it? - You too get in line and bring uniform to my room. - Yes. - Go it? - Yes. Good. Ask whatever you want to. After all you've to make her daughter-in-law. You should make all the enquiries. Lalla Khopchand, your choice can't be wrong. The girl's face shows that she's decent and simple... ...simple and from a good family. - Right, daughter Shobha? - Yes, mother. He makes thorough enquires. What is your name? - That... - Kastoori. Wow! What a nice name! Kastoori. - House will be full of fragrance. - Kastoori. Seek mother-in-law's blessings. [MUMMRING] God bless you. Seek Lalla's blessing. No, mother-in-law. Silli, why are you standing here? Go and prepare the meals. Sit down, daughter. Mahesh. You don't want to go to the farm? Yes, mother. I'm going. Mother-in-law, allow us to leave. Not fair, Lalla. You just came and want to leave. No. I took a responsibility to reach her safely home. Actually I was not going to come. But suddenly her father got minor heart attack. So I've to reach her early. - Shobha, hurry up! We've to leave. - No. Let Shobha stay here. You've lots of work to do. When you're free you can take her along. I don't mind. Keep her for lifetime. But after marriage daughter is guest at her maternal house. I don't feel so. Mother-in-law, what should I say? [GIGGLING] Say it. No. I insist. No. - I say, tell her. - No. - I say, tell her. - No. - Why not? - I said no. What is it, Lalla? Shobha wants you to say something, but you refuse. I didn't understand. Shobha, you tell me. - Actually... - No, Shobha. Mother, he has to pay 8000 to the society. I told him to take it from you, but he refuses. Lalla, why to feel shy from me? No, mother. You already did me so much favour. - I don't like to trouble you more. - Why not? You don't have to beg others till I'm here. - Mother, to trouble you... - What trouble? I will get the money. As you wish. [SIGHS] Great! Ms. Kastoori Devi. You've done a great job. No maiden can shy like you. Wait, wait, wait. I'll give it to you. Take 500 rupees for your night. Thank God, I got rid of that problem. My heart was beating very fast on that time. And that old woman was jumping with joy. That's fine, Lalla. But how will we pass... ...the second act? I know you'll never fail to steal... ...hearts of young boys. Never. Never. That old woman will dance to your tune. And you... You just steal her keys and... ...plunder all her money. That's it. [GIGGLING] But I've to become wife of your brother-in-law. Have you thought that? Don't talk like virtuous lady? You're already married. Married for ever. Dupe that Prakash too. Then we'll have a new start... ...and a bright future. Sir, you called for me? Yes, Prakash. What do you do after duty hours? - Me? - Yes. - I didn't understand you, sir? - I mean... ...as you're single, you must be... ...dating girls and having affair after work? No, sir. Not at all. - Are you sure? - Sure, sir. - Sir, has anyone complained about me? - It isn't so. But it's strange! Why don't you meet girls? Are you shy? No, sir. Are you scared? Yes. I'm scared. [GIGGLES] Good! I wanted to know this. It means you're a decent and virtuous fellow. Thank you, sir. It's about girl's college. I'm giving you a responsibility. - I don't consider you a coward but decent. - Yes, sir. We got invitation from Sarla Devi's girl college. There's a fair for destitute girls. Go and give this donation and apologise on my behalf... - ...for my absence. - Yes, sir. And take some decent cadets with you to make it lively. Yes, sir. Gulalwadi's gem is here. Come, sir. Enjoy mouth watering savouries. It'll lift your spirits. Cheap and best stuff. Come on. Come. - Principal? - Yes. Kindly accept this check with best wishes from our academy. Thank you. - [SHOTGUN SOUND] - [BALLON POPPING] I've spent 15 and not hit a target. If I had invested I would've got richer. Bad luck! [CHUCKLES] Durga, it seems your stall will make the most profit. Why? Because they look at you and miss the target. For a good cause it's a good thing. Go quickly. - Madam, how much for a chance. - One rupee. Take this. - [SHOTGUN SOUND] - [BALLON POPPING] Thank you very much. - [SHOTGUN SOUND] - [BALLON POPPING] Thank you. [DRUM PLAYING] - [SHOTGUN SOUND] - [BALLON POPPING] Thank you. [DRUM PLAYING] - [SHOTGUN SOUND] - [BALLON POPPING] Thank you. May I try my luck too? Yes, why not? But your rewards are very costly. You don't forget old incidents? Okay, I've forgotten it. [SHOTGUN SOUND] [SHOTGUN SOUND] You don't know how to shoot? I'm trying. I might hit the target. If a soldier is wooed, how will he shoot? If you can't hit the target, move on. Give me a chance too. Uncle, you've passed the age to aim. Got it? Your reward. Later. - Can I ask you something? - Yes. Why not? I had coffee with you, but I don't even know your name. That's nothing. It always happens with us, I mean with soldiers. They aren't known by their name, only by their ranks. But I'll have to tell you. My name is Prakash. Is it nice? It's good. What's yours? Durga. - Is it okay? - It's very nice. - And it's familiar too. - What do you mean? You're Durga and I know Bhawani since childhood. - Who is that? - My mother. They are searching girl for me. Here. Did you find any girl? Yes. My mother didn't find any, but I've found one. [WAVES SPLASHING] What if she rejects your choice? Even God can't stop us now, Durga. [WAVES SPLASHING] Durga, you'll stand by me? Yes, Prakash. [WAVES SPLASHING] Rail! Rail! Rail! Rail! Rail! Rail! - Veena, give me this train. - No, it's mine. - I want to play with it. - No, I won't give you. I'll snatch it. I won't give it. I won't give it. I'll call grandma now. Granny! Granny! Granny! Pappu! What is it, son? Granny, this Veena won't give me the train. Why not? No, grandma this is mine. I won't give it. - I'm telling you to give it to him. - No. - She's a spoilt brat. - Yes. Her mother has pampered her. Veena! - Give it. - No, I won't. It's mine. - Don't be stubborn. Pappu is your brother. - No. - Uncle has sent it for me. - Give it, dear. I won't give it, I won't give it. Why won't you give it? Why won't you give it? - My uncle has sent it. - Isn't your uncle related to him? Next time don't even dare to touch it. Move. Veena! My dear. Pappu. Take it, son. [CRYING] Don't cry, dear. We'll get you another one. - You don't get me anything. - I promise you. How will you get it? You've no money. Grandma doesn't give you any money. - Father keeps asking her for money. - Dear! [CRYING] Don't cry. I won't be stubborn again. I won't even touch the toy train. Dear, Veena! Veena! Veena! Thank you. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [JEEP MOVING] Hello, Gupta. - Hello, Sinha. - Hello. - You're in the club after a long time. - I've a wife at home. I'm not single like you to prowl here for a wife. - Found anyone? - Many, but none are good looking. Really? Then tell me where do all the women look beautiful? - I don't know. - In the darkness. [LAUGHING] But in this brightness there is a beautiful girl in the club. - Who? - Your daughter. - Is Durga here? - Yes, she's sitting with cadet Prakash. Okay, okay. This will be fun. The ice-cream is tasty. - Have this cherry. - No, I've just had tea. - Have it. No. - I'll catch cold. For me. - You. - Keep sitting. - Who is she? - I... She's Durga. Colonel Gupta. - Greetings! - Greetings! Keep sitting. - Is she your relative? - I... I... She's not related. She's just a friend now. Girlfriend. - You mean you like each other. - Yes, sir. - No. - No need to hide from sir? Strange! You had told me you were afraid of girls. I had said it. - Has the fear vanished now? - Fear. - But you... - You keep sitting... Sit. How long do you know each other? - That... - Please you shut up! I am talking with Prakash. For how long do you know her? Sir, not too long. About ten odd days. - Not since many days. - Whatever, but do your parents know... - ...that you're seeing Prakash. - No. - What? - No they don't know. - Aren't you a decent girl? - Yes. - Sir... - Yes. Then before taking this step you should've... ...taken parents' consent, isn't it? - Yes. - But, sir. - Keep quiet. I'm speaking to her. - Yes, sir. Go home now. I need to speak to Prakash. - But... - Please go home. - I... - Durga, I... So you've started dating girls? - How will you work? - No, sir. It's not true. It is. You've made a big mistake. I'll decide verdict tomorrow. Report to my place at 10 tomorrow. - Okay? - Okay, sir. Okay. - Sit down. - Okay, sir. [WHISTLING] Good evening, sir. Sir, have you returned after seeing a tragic love story? Your face looks so pale. - It isn't shinning like this shoe. - Totaram! I mean, since a few day you were in a romantic mood. Totaram. You can't trust girls. First, they promise and change altogether. He bluntly refused that you both meet each other. She just left on colonel's order. Even the colonel found out? He's a very strict. That's why I'm content with my posters. I'll put it in your room too. You won't have any girl trouble. Totaram, you want me to get court marshaled. Colonel has called me home. Called you home? Bad sign, sir! Bad sign. This is bad news. Once he had called captain D'souza home. For seven days captain was running... ...on the parade ground with rifle on his head. - And captain Nanavati... - Totaram. I've to report in the morning. Let me sleep. Will you be able to sleep, sir? I say... ...get out. Best of luck, sir. Good morning, sir. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. Sit down. I'm fine here. I said sit down. Sumitra, this is Prakash, a senior cadet from our academy. And these days along with military duty he's chasing girls. - No, sir. - Keep sitting. Didn't you tell me yesterday... - What was the girl's name? - Durga. - That you like Durga. - Yes, I had said it. - But... But... Sir. - Just like that? Yes. - Just like that? - Yes. That means you don't like Durga? No, no, sir. Not at all. It was just like that. - Just like that, again. - Yes. But Durga said you like her. Durga? Did she meet you again? What do you mean? I meet her every day. - What? - She's here right now. - No, sir. - Yes, yes. - Durga! - Yes? - Durga, Prakash is here. - Hello. - Keep sitting. - Yes, sir. Hello. - You know her? - Yes. - Do you know her parents? - No, sir. I'm her father and she's her mother. - No, sir. - No. - She's our daughter? - Yes. - Sit down. - Thank you, sir. - This means you know nothing about her? - No, sir. - You should know. - I must know, sir. - Do you know she's a good painter? - Yes, sir. - How? Have you seen her paintings? - No, sir. Then how do you know? Dear, show him your paintings. - Come. - I don't need to see the paintings? You've to. We need privacy to speak. Go. Thank you, sir. [CLATTER] I'm sorry, sir. [GIGGLING] How is the boy? He's very simple, but you harassed him a lot. It's an old habit. How will he be for our Durga? - He's good. - Not only good, he's very talented. - He'll progress. - Really? [SIGHS] Prakash. What happened, Prakash? Papa! No. Don't call colonel. He has shocked me to the hilt. Why are you so afraid of my dad? He likes to joke. He's your father, but he's my boss. And he has ordered me to know all about you. They're taking too long to see the paintings. Let's check. You're after him again. Relax. Okay, serve tea. I didn't know you're such a fine artist. You've a temple in your room? - Why? - No. I mean modern and educated girls don't pray. I do. I get a lot of peace. Have you found out about his family? The academy has his records. They're landlords. Father isn't alive. He has a big family. They're rich. Then what are you waiting for? Talk to his mother. I thought the same. Hey. Whose bride is she? It was a thought, so I made it. You've made a bride. I want to make one too. Durga, will you marry me? "My beloved. O my beloved." "My beloved! Since you came..." "...the entire world is with me." "It's with me." "My beloved, O my beloved." "My beloved! The world is nothing..." "...since I got you." "Since it's with me." "My unfulfilled desires ask me..." "...how long will we be together." "Till the heart keeps beating." "Till there are dreams in eyes." "With every heartbeat I feel like a bride." "With every heartbeat I feel like a bride." "You've come with a dream like a marriage procession." "You've come." - "My beloved. - My beloved." - "Since you came... - Since you came..." "...the entire world is with me." "It's with me." "Tell me." "The life of my soul." "Tell me, how you would care for me." "We'll stay together the way..." "...colours merge with each other." "With colours, desires and dreams..." "...someone has come like the rain." "He has come." "My beloved. O my beloved." "My beloved! Since you came..." "...the entire world is with me." "It's with me." "My beloved. O my beloved." "My beloved! The world is nothing..." "...since I got you." "It's with me." - "It's with me. - It's with me." - Greetings. - Yes? - Does Mrs. Bhavani Devi stay here? - Yes. - What is your good name? - I'm Colonel Gupta from Bombay. Come. Please come. Come in. Come. Please take a seat. - I'll inform the madam. - Okay. Until we don't get the balance 30,000 of the dowry... ...I'll not send Sheila home. Mother, let me go to attend my brother's wedding. - I'll never ask again. - I said no. - Mother, please. - Get lost. - Don't cry, dear. Don't cry. - Mother. Mother. [SOBBING] Stop crying and go inside. And you listen to me. Forget that you ever had a daughter. - Don't cry, dear. Don't cry. - Mother. [CRYING] I'm going. [CRYING] - Mother! - Stop this drama and go inside. [CRYING] Come. - Ok. - Come. - Madam, he wants to meet you. - Greetings. Greetings. - Please take a seat. - Thank you. This is my daughter. What can I do for you? I'm colonel Gupta. I've come from Mumbai to meet you. Okay! My son Prakash is in Mumbai too. - He's taking military training. - Yes, I know that. He's a very talented boy. I've come to talk to you about him. Meaning? My daughter Durga is doing graduation. Prakash knows her very well and both are fond of each other. I'd like it if their choice could be cemented forever. If you agree to this proposal, I'll consider myself lucky. I've brought the snaps of my daughter with me. Take a look. Look, mother, she even knows how to dance. Yes, she dances very well. She has learnt it with dedication. The she must've learnt singing too. Yes, she can sing a little. - What else has she learnt? - Actually... The skill to trap affluent boys also. I don't get it. My son is rich but he is simple. You want to misguide him to seize his wealth. You wouldn't be capable of giving a dowry? Listen, I'm an army officer and serve respectfully... ...so I won't be able to give a dowry. But my daughter is virtuous and respectful. Respectful? The girl who dances with anklets on her feet can't... ...be our daughter-in-law. Mrs. Bhavani, you're insulting me and my daughter. I erred by bringing a proposal here. Did we send you a procession to call you here? No, but had I known you're so rude I won't have come here. You make your daughter dance in front of thousands... ...and you're pointing out my faults. Mrs. Bhavani, you're crossing your limits. Instead of ruining a decent house... ...get her to join a troupe. I know what I've to do with my daughter. But my daughter will never come to the house... ...where the mother-in-law is like you. Got it? Shobha! I fear that Prakash might get trapped by that girl. We should get him married quickly. I'll send Sukhlal to fetch him tomorrow. - There. - There. - Can I go inside, guard? - Yes. Don't remove your shoes. It's fine here. Consider it your own regiment. Please sit and relax there. Lord Ram! Ram! Disgusting. [HUMMING] Looks like you're still a bachelor. How did you come to know? Looking at all these posters you've put up on the wall... ...like a juice centre. What can I do, Mr. Dukhlal? I mean Mr. Sukhlal. - I can't sleep in the night. - Really? Yes! I look at these snaps and when the eyes get tired... ...I'm able to sleep for a while. Then why don't you get married? I'm ready to get married, but I can't find a girl. A handsome young man like you should never be short of female company. That's right. There are lots of girls. - But I want someone different. - Oh. Someone who has eyes like Zeenat Amaan. Nose like Hema Malini and lips like Raakhi. I asked you everything but I didn't ask your name? Yes, that got left out. I'm Totaram, a single bird. - Then an alliance is already made. - Alliance? What alliance? Your name is Totaram and my daughter's name is Maina. Even she's still a maiden. Why didn't you tell me earlier? I'll just come. [HUMMING] Why are you taking all this trouble, friend? It's no trouble. We get it at a discount in the army canteen. Please help yourself. - How is it? - Good. Pungent. - I was asking about the girl. - Girl? - Oh! Maina. - Yes, yes, Mania. She's form the village, but very beautiful. And she's expert in doing house-hold chores. - How are her eyes? - Eyes. - Like this. - Like Zeenat Amaan. - Absolutely. - Great. - And her nose? - Nose? Nose? Like this. - Like Hema Malini? - Yes. - Wow, wow! And her lips? - Lips. Like these. - Lips like Rakhee. - Forget this. Come to our village and see her. No need to see her now, father-in-law. When I've seen you, it's as good as seeing the girl. Kindly sit relaxed. Like this. Okay. Like this. - But should I keep this plate in my hands? - Yes. Hold it. Don't move. Don't move. Are you clicking my snap? Got it. Now I'll remove all these snaps... ...and put yours... ...and pray day and night. You looks decent and from a respectful family. - Visit our village sometime. - I'll definitely come. - I'll apply for leave right away. - Ok. - Because due to Mr. Prakash we've become close. - Ok. - Totaram! - Yes? Bring the keys of my room. - Yes. - Mr. Prakash has come. - Come. - Let's go. Welcome, uncle Sukhlal. Sit. How come you are here suddenly? I'll tell that to you later. First have these sweets. Sheila has sent them especially for you. I'm eating sweets made by sister-in-law after a long time. Poor soul. But uncle, why did she send these? She only knows it. Anyway madam has called you. You must've received her letter. Got it, uncle. What's the point in meeting the girl I don't want to marry? Why? Have you found one here? Yes, uncle. Is she from a good family? Uncle, Durga is the daughter of colonel Gupta of our academy. Colonel Gupta? - Didn't you say Colonel Gupta? - Yes. Why? What is it, uncle? It's a problem. What problem? First finish the food. I'll tell you later. - It shouldn't have happened. - What? Colonel had come with a proposal... ...but madam insulted him very badly. - She didn't even offer tea to him. - Tea! Why did you take the trouble, Mr. Totaram? What is the trouble in serving our people? Isn't it, sir? - Please take it. - Go ahead, uncle. Have tea, sir. Tea. Uncle. We should go to colonel's house immediately. Mother has insulted him. - I should apologise. - Yes let's go. Uncle. He left. Remember the alliance of Tota and Maina. No, Prakash, this isn't possible now. I can never forget your mother's behaviour. That was most insulting. If she wasn't interested in our proposal... ...she could've refused it. - What was the need to insult? - Yes. I apologise for her behaviour, sir. I apologise on her behalf. Still I can't agree for this marriage. I can't send my daughter to the woman who... ...treats her daughter-in-law worse than a beast. I'm taking the responsibility of Durga's future, sir. - But you... - I assure you. Durga will never have to enter that house. - How is it possible? - Sir. You're know I'll become an officer soon. I'll have a good job, a place to stay... ...respect and everything. We'll stay here, sir. You mean to say you won't live in your mother's house? No, sir. I don't desire my mother's wealth. Durga is well aware of it. Dear Durga. This concerns your future. Before I take a decision I want to know your opinion. Papa, I'm aware of everything. I can stay in any state with him. Now she has also agreed, sir. Please agree. Look, they make a good couple. When Durga doesn't have to go that house... ...what difference does it make? Prakash isn't at fault. Okay, I'll fix the wedding day today. Come, Sumitra. Bless them. - Bless you. - Blessings. Come, Durga. What is this, son? Uncle Sukhlal, you call me a son, but you won't bless us. God bless the couple. Colonel Gupta's daughter is marrying... ...Prakash... Prakash Chandra Chowdhary. What? What is it? Why did the newspaper drop from your hands? Is it some bad news? My beautiful Kesar. From every evil I can get profit. Here, read this. This means that before you could stage your plan... ...your brother-in-law uprooted the stage. [SIGHS] Kesar, now... - We don't need to stage a drama. - Meaning? I'll tell you. Sit here. Prakash, has married against his mother's will. Now he can't even set a foot in that house. And nobody can drive me out of there. [SIGHS] Kesar, that old woman won't even look at his face now. I won't even look at his face now. He has defamed me. How dare he! He married the girl whose father you had insulted? Then madam, younger daughter-in-law will come here. No. She'll never come here. They can't even set a foot here. My name is Bhavani. [HUMMING] [DOOR BELL RINGING] Coming. He's impatient. Congratulations, my darling. My sweetheart, congrats. - What is the happy occasion? - You... - You... - What has happened to me? I'll tell you after a treat. I'll tell you if you give me something sweet. - Tell me? - First sweet. - Tell me? - First sweet. First tell me. - Now tell me. - Should I? You've graduated in first class with honours. - Really? - Yes. - [KNOCK ON THE DOOR] - What a pain? Who could it be? [KNOCK ON THE DOOR] [CHUCKLES] - Whose letter is it? - Maybe from brother. 'Dear Prakash.' 'You did a good thing by marrying against mom's wish.' 'My wife and I wanted to see you as a groom.' 'But mom's anger buried our desire.' 'You know our helplessness very well.' 'Now we pray to God...' '...to save your wife from the bane of pain of this house.' 'Bless you.' 'Veena has also sent you a letter.' What is it? 'My dear uncle.' 'Grandma hits me a lot.' 'She snatched the train-set you had...' '...sent for me and gave it to Pappu.' Because of me you're staying away from your family. They all want to meet you. Let's go there once. For what? To hear mother's abuses? To tolerate her torture? No matter what, but she's your mother. She also have a heart. Durga, you don't know the tortures brother and sister-in-law are going through. Veena's childhood is being snatched away from her. You got your mother's love. I didn't get love from my mother. The doors of that house are closed forever for you. Everything there is not ours anymore. Forget it. [COW MOO] Whose snap were you clicking? Tell me the truth. You were clicking my snap? I'll tell you if you leave me. Tell me. Tell me quickly. Actually first I could see two buffaloes in my camera. - But from close range I could see only one. - Ok. Ok. - What? You're calling me a buffalo? - No! So you're calling me a buffalo? Answer me? No, no, you're like top actress of India. - Beauty queen. - Really? But leave my neck, please. Please. - Does your father have a ration shop? - No. - He works in the mansion. - Mansion? - Do you know Mr. Sukhla? - He's my father. - Mr. Sukhlal is your father? - Yes. Is your name Maina? - Yes, yes, I'm Maina. - Maina. - Who are you? - I'm Totaram. Oh God! You're Tota and I'm Maina. If you get up, I'll get some relief. - Yes. - Yes, please. - My legs. I'm safe. - I hope I'm not heavy. No, no, you're heavy and I'm thankful. - Won't you click my snap? - Sure. Let me breathe and straighten my arm out. Smile please. [GIGGLING] - What happened? - Give me a cute smile. Don't grin like a wrestler, but like a girl. You should've said so. Yes, this is correct. Keep smiling. - Mr. Totaram. - Here. - Totaram, when did you come? - I haven't. I'm still on the way. - And you've already met your Maina. - Yes. - You're clicking snaps before the wedding? - No, no. Child Maina, serve our guest. I'll return from the mansion. Even I'll come along. Where are you going? Come. Let me serve you. - Take good care of him. - Come on! Get a plate of fritters and savoury. - Give water to that customer. - Waiter. Come here. - What is it, sir? - Have you made this dish in oil or kerosene? You're strange, sir. We don't get oil or kerosene these days. Think what you want and eat it. Make special tea, friend. Give me half a kilogram of pudding. Bring half a kilogram pudding. - Please, pack it. - Parcel it. Half a kilogram of pudding? Another fellow is trapped. Father, keep blessing me... ...so that I can serve mother-in-law. When did you come, Lalla? - Bless me. - What are you doing? - With your blessing I got land for the soap factory. - Good. - So I performed veneration. - Good. - It isn't good to delay God's veneration. - Right. Kindly take this offering. Lalla, only the fortunate get a son-in-law like you. What are you doing? Sheila! Take some offerings too. Take some more. [GIGGLES] Sukhlal. - Take some offering and distribute the rest. - Sure, sir. - You've done a great deed. - That's fine. Actually, mother, I vowed that if my work gets done... - ...I'd offer gold bracelets to the Goddess. - Okay. The work got done, but where has she gone? Shobha! - When did you come? - Forget that. Give me your bracelets. What is this, Lalla? In front of the mother, you'll make her remove her bracelets. No, but I've to fulfil the vow. Give it to me. Wait. Silli. Silli. - Yes, mother. - Come here. Remove those bracelets. What? Don't stare me. Remove your bracelets and give it to Lalla. - He'll offer it to the Goddess. - No. - Why Sheila's bracelets? - Why not? Is she going to take them to the grave? Give it. Here. O God! Is anybody there? I said... Whom do you want? Yes, my father-in-law... I mean is Mr. Sukhlal, here. Sukhlal! Somebody has come to meet you. Thank you. - Totaram. - Yes. Come. Who is the man who called you? - Son-in-law of this house. - Son-in-law. - He's distributing offering. Have some. - Okay. It's not an offering. It's a pudding from Hotel Naryan made in kerosene. I saw this man buying this pudding from there. He's a crooked son-in-law. Good Lord! This is the limit. This means all this drama was to get... ...daughter-in-law's bracelets. In this manner he'll ruin this house. No, no. I'll have to go to town and inform Mr. Prakash about it. Everything. He distributed pudding as an offering. Disgusting! Not just that, he took daughter-in-law's bangles. He said he had vowed to offer it to the Goddess. With a mother-in-law like that forget bangles... ...he'll even sell off the house. But our mother won't understand it. He's being applauded and the son and... ...daughter-in-law aren't even getting proper food. Veena doesn't even have a toy to play with. And whenever he comes, he doesn't leave... ...without taking at least goods worth 8 to 10000. But why don't your brother and sister Sheila say something. Durga, you don't know anything about our house. Our father was a very brave man. But whatever clout he had was outside the house. Mother always ruled the house. When father couldn't do a thing what will... ...brother and sister-in-law do? But the responsibility of our house is ours too. Which house? - I've forgotten that house forever. - No, sir. Don't say that. I'm not talking about the... ...materialistic value of that house. But think of the living souls that can't utter a word. Those who have suppressed their desires... ...and are suffering everything. I want to know how long will all this go on. Sukhlal uncle, even I've a heart. I'm related to them. Even I think a lot... ...but does anything happen without mother's consent? I've often told brother and sister-in-law to come here. And I'm telling you too. That house isn't for humans. Why don't you stay with us? Why should I? You call them your blood relatives... ...but you don't want to have anything to do with them. I'm a servant. My loyalty is with them. I can't ignore them. Bye. - Sukhlal uncle. - I came with great expectations, but fine. Whatever God has willed will happen. 'Think of those living souls who can't speak.' 'The train-set you had sent for me was...' '...snatched and given to Pappu.' 'My wife and I wanted to see you as a groom.' 'But mother's anger buried our desire.' Durga, why have you woken up? I can't sleep. Why? What is it? - Can I ask you something? - Yes. - Will you listen to me? - Have I ever refused you? - Tell me, what is it? - Promise me. I promise. - I want to go to my in-laws' house. - What? In-laws' house? Are you in your senses? Absolutely. We've such a big house and a family. Then why should we live away like strangers. Why are you getting this idiotic notion suddenly? Not suddenly, I had thought about this before marriage. Before marriage? This means you want to avenge your father's insult. - No, it's not like that. - So why do you insist to go there. Why don't you understand? The tears in Sukhlal uncle's eyes forced me to... ...think about those poor souls. I'm getting restless thinking about... ...your brother, sister-in-law and Veena. We've to go there, please. But listen. My mother won't even let you into the house. I'm sure I'll receive her love and blessing. Love and blessings from my mother? No matter what, we'll go. You've promised me. Okay, but we'll go with a return ticket. Because we'll have to return from the doorstep. - Shall we leave right now? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. Fine. Let's go to sleep now. God, I'm going today with a big responsibility. Grant me strength to fulfil it. - Papa. - Dear, when you've decided to go, I won't stop you. But my heart says you'll not be happy there. Papa, after marriage in-law's house is the girl's house. Bless me so that I can bring happiness in that house. I would bless you that... ...you succeed to change your mother-in-law's feelings for you. Mother! Always treat your mother-in-law's problems as your problems. A daughter-in-law's duty is to serve her. - Go, dear. - Mother. [CAR STOPPED SOUND] Sister-in-law! Prakash, you! Greetings. Don't come in, brother-in-law. Wait here. But... Greetings, young master, young madam. - Greetings, uncle Shuklal. How are you? - Everything is fine. - Brother driver, help me unload. - Come. Go, daughter. Go quickly. Now come inside. No, not you. First sister-in-law will enter. Goddess Laxmi is entering in the form of new bride. Durga, with your foot topple the urn filled with... ...grains and hop over and enter the house. So that there is never a dearth of grains in your house. Wait! Wait there. Silli, who had told you to do all this? Go inside. Shobha. Who are these strangers at our door? Strangers? We aren't strangers, mother, it's us. Shobha, tell them... ...I don't recognise them. Sister, tell her, her younger son has come with him... ...his wife, the daughter-in-law of this house has come. I had a younger son, but he's no more. Consider the dignity of your age before you speak. Heard, mother? She's her to teach you wisdom. Throw her out of here. Her father had declared proudly that... ...my daughter will never enter your house. Then why are you here? They told you. I had not said anything. I'm the new daughter-in-law of this house. I've come to my house... - ...and I won't stop now. - Durga. This is the limit. Let's leave. No. I'll complete the rituals and enter... - ...at any cost. - Really? Is it so? Then I'll kick the rituals out. I'm telling you to leave. Go away. Don't do such inauspicious deeds, mother. Goddess Laxmi gets insulted. Think about your honour. What did you say? I... I should think about my honour? Get lost from here. No, mother. I'm your daughter-in-law. You'll have to accept me. So you won't go so easily. I'll have you thrown out forcefully. Mother! Get lost. I don't need your pretence. Wow! After insulting mother you're honouring her! - Sister! Mother. I'm going. Fine. Take her with you. I'll not be able to tolerate her here. Even I want her to leave. But I can't help it. She won't listen to me. Really? So she has come with the intention to fight me. I'll see how long she can survive before you. Take care of yourself. Durga. I'm worried about you... I don't know how you'll get along with mother. Don't worry about that. I take care of everything. Keep writing to me. Okay. [CAR MOVING] [CLATTER] Let it be, Durga. What is this, sister? You don't let me work. Even I'm in my husband's house like you. You've come here for a few days. I don't like to make you work. But you keep working all day. I'm eternally bound to this house. Work has become a routine for me. I'm not going to leave in four days. I'm here for good. Why do you want to ruin your happy life? I've come to face sorrow. I've come to help change my sister's suffocating existence. Sister! Durga, only the fortunate ones get sister like you. In this house, I feel blessed finding your support. Sister. You're crying. I'm shedding tears right from the day I got married. For the first time these are tears of joy. Can I ask you something? Sure! After hearing from him about here I was wondering how... ...you endure mother-in-law's atrocities for so long. If cornered even an ant retaliates. Don't you've a heart? I do... ...but it's dead. Let it be. Don't say anything. Let me speak. Let me tell you everything today. By telling you I'll be relieved of the burden on my soul. From my maternal home I came here. Mother-in-law mentions about my parents' poverty frequently. I receive taunts everyday. It was our first wedding night. With dreams of a new life... ...I was going to his room. Wait! Where are you going? Are you going to your room? First tell me when are your parents... ...going to pay the 30,000 balance of the dowry? I don't know? But they've said they will. Yes, but when? After their death. Listen carefully. Until I don't get 30000 you'll not go to your maternal home. Not even on their death. Mother, why are you speaking such ill words? You're arguing with me. Wait. I'll show you. I'll give you a lesson you'll never forget. - Mother! No! - Come. - Come. - No! You act smart and back answer me. - Don't do this, mother. Don't do it. - There. Got it? I've caused a burn on your foot deliberately so that... ...on every step of your life you remember... ...the consequence of confronting me. Now go and begin your new life. I was crying the whole night with my head on his shoulder. He kept explaining and consoling me. But he didn't have courage to question mother. Mom, don't get me married or else... ...my mother-in-law will burn my foot too. Veena, don't say that. Sister, I'm here to heal your wounds. ...of body and soul too. Now there won't be any more injustice in this house. Silli. Serve the food. Sit, mother. I'll serve the food. Why? What's wrong with her? Now that I'm here, sister Sheila won't do all the work. I too have some duty. Saw, mom? Colonel's daughter has learnt her duty too. She's new here. She'll do some drama in the beginning. Don't stare me. Serve the food quickly. I'm hungry. Oh God! What a tasteless food! The second one is worse than the first. We aren't destined to eat good food. Eat, daughter. Serve. Serve me. Is this lentil? There is too much water. It's totally bland. And this vegetable is too salty. Even an animal won't eat this food. Eat it. Sister, you too sit and eat food. - No, no. I'll eat later. - Why later? I'll serve you. Sit down. Wait. She will sit to dine with us? Why not? She's the elder daughter-in-law of the house. Sit, sister. Silli, get up. No. She won't get up. Eat, sister. Don't worry. What did you say? You incite her against me! Shameless one! How dare you! Eat, sister. [SIGHS] The new bride is supervising the harvest. She's counting trees of the orchard. Tomorrow she'll go to check rooms on rent. And then... Then she'll send you a notice. Strange! Doesn't she respect her elders? I've no right to meddle. But honestly, my love for you forces me to do that. - Dad, letter for you. - Yes, son. [CLATTER] Letter. - Who has written it? - Your younger son. For her wife. Actually we shouldn't read letters of husband and wife. But this matter seems to be... Anyway, let it be. God knows what he might have written. Please read it, Lalla. Let's see what they are up to. No, no, mother. It doesn't seem right. Let it be. They deserve such treatment. Shobha, open and read the letter. Okay, mom. [PAPER RUSTLE] Papu, what are you doing here? - Go and play outside. - Wait, son. I'll give you sweets. Here, son. Eat it. No, granny. I'm not hungry. Please eat it. It's made from clarified butter. Take it. Have it. Yes, Shobha. Read it aloud so that all of us can hear. My darling. My dream girl. [GIGGLING] It's not for you, but for her. Read further. I've always written you to come back. But you always write that you won't return... ...before achieving the goal for which you went there. Lalla. What would be her goal? What else, mother? She wants her right. She has started with farms and orchards. Let her. I'll see her. What has he written further? You must've understood my mother's nature. She's a tyrant. She is obsessed with power and wealth. Oh God! God! Did you see, mother? This is the return for your maternal love. Read further. What does my brother-in-law write ahead? Even God can restrict her atrocities and greed. My elder sister... Why did you stop? Read further. You read. [PAPER RUSTLE] My elder sister Shobha Devi must be fulfilling... ...her duty by instigating mother. Such a sister, who ruins her brother's... ...married life, is a bane. May he ruin! He's criticizing his mother and sister. - Oh God! - Listen further. My dutiful, kind and able brother-in-law... Khopchand. I think you should read further, mother. My dutiful, kind and able brother-in-law is Khopchand. What can I write about his greatness! Even humans have qualities of animals. Some are as simple as a cow. Some are brave and kind like lion. But Mr. Khopchand is sly like a fox. What are you doing, mother? What are you doing? That fool is maligning all of us. What should I read? Don't throw it down, mother. Don't throw it down. What if someone sees? Granny, where are mom and aunt? - To hell. - Granny, why do you say so? I am hungry too. You gave sweets to Pappu. Give me too. There is bread and pickle in the kitchen. Go and eat it. Get lost! No. I won't eat bread and pickle. I want sweets. You want sweets? Get lost. No. I won't go. I want sweets. You want sweets? You will eat sweets? Here. - Eat sweets. - Mother! - Why are you hitting my daughter? - Here are sweets. - Hit me if you want. Do anything. - She wants sweets. But please don't hit my innocent daughter. Wow! You gave birth to a girl and humiliated us. Now you back answer us. I think she has taught it to you. I'll fix you right now. What are you doing, mother? It's not her fault. Sister, take Veena inside. You! Who are you to stop me? How dare you! Mother, calm down. Elders should keep themselves calm. Tell me, what's the matter? Durga Devi, did you check the farms and fields? Yes. Now see the houses on rent. Get the details about them. Check the accounts of the rents. Any outsider shouldn't interfere in our family matters. He's not an outsider, but you are. And you want to seize it. Tell me, why did you go to the farms with Silli? To see our farms and workers. I didn't do anything wrong. Yes. But you didn't do the right thing. I am telling you on behalf of mother. Such attitudes seem to be wrong. I am saying the same thing. Such attitudes seem to be wrong. Someday you might get in trouble. Yes, Totaram. - You want to marry Maina. - Yes, sir. But I can't live in quarters with you after marriage. - Why? - Because the quarters door is small. - So I've rented a garage. - Okay. Uncle. What do you think? What can I say, sir? Do whatever you think is right. I agree. Maina, do you have any objection? [LAUGHING] Uncle, I know Totaram very well. He's honest and has a job. I'm sure he'll keep Maina happy. Then fix the alliance, sir. I am not capable to hold a grand marriage. But... Don't worry about that. If not a grand, but it'll be a great wedding. [LAUGHING] Totaram, congrats. - You've won a lottery today. - And a bumper one, sir. Okay. Take it. No, I won't take dowry. Fool! Who will give you dowry? It's for sweets. - Sweets? - I should pay for it. Uncle, both the bride and groom are my own. - So it's my right. - As you wish. Here. Bring and distribute sweets. But it'll fetch only half a kilogram. Give me more. Please. - Shall I go? - Yes. Bye. Bye. Bye. [LAUGHING] - Uncle. - Yes? How is everyone at home? There's nothing new, sir. But after the arrival of younger daughter-in-law... - ...the greedy son-in-law has cowered. - Ok. Come, sister. Durga, these fish look so happy. Every since your arrival, even they get food on time. They may be dumb, but even they've the rights to live. But in this house only selected ones have the rights to live. Do you know tomorrow is husband's day? The biggest festival for a wife. But only Shobha has the right to celebrate it in this house. How is it possible? We too are married. We'll celebrate it with pomp. We'll gather the women of the neighbourhood... ...and have a dance function. Durga, I know this is your first husband's day festival. You've lots of desires in your heart. But what can we do about mother-in-law's nature? One without kindness in one's heart can't have happiness. But doesn't she even think that on this day... ...her daughter-in-law prays for her son's long life. Mother can only see her daughter and son-in-law. Besides them she can't see anyone else. Neither sons nor daughters-in-law. What a mother! What a mother-in-law! Silli! Silli! - Where are you, fool! - I'll be back. "May our mother-in-law have a long life!" "May our mother-in-law have a long life!" "We love our mother-in-law more than our mother." "Our mothers gave us birth." "But you gave us our beloveds." "Our mothers gave us birth." "But you gave us our beloveds." "You are great, mother-in-law!" "Have a long life!" "May our mother-in-law have a long life!" "We love our mother-in-law more than our mother." "May my husband's face always glow with happiness!" "My husband's face!" "May my husband live for as long as the stars and the moon!" "May he have a long life." "These symbols of marriage..." "...are the priceless gems of life." "All these are your gifts, mother-in-law." "Have a long life!" "May our mother-in-law have a long life!" "We love our mother-in-law more than our mother." "My brother-in-law is like my brother." "My sister-in-law is like an angel." "My elder brother-in-law is like my guardian." "My elder sister-in-law is like my lady luck." "My husband's sister is like my sister." "We can't praise this sister enough." "They are all here because of you, mother-in-law." "Have a long life!" "May our mother-in-law have a long life!" "We love our mother-in-law more than our mother." "When a daughter leaves her maternal house..." "...she craves for maternal love." "She craves for maternal love." "Maternal love and affection showers..." "...in my mother-in-law's house." "Showers in my mother-in-law's house." "This house is more beautiful than heaven." "Daughter-in-law is treated like a daughter." "Our mother-in-law personified maternal love." "Have a long life!" "May our mother-in-law have a long life!" "We love our mother-in-law more than our mother." "Our mothers gave us birth." "But you gave us our beloveds." "Our mothers gave us birth." "But you gave us our beloveds." "You are great, mother-in-law!" "Have a long life!" "May our mother-in-law have a long life!" "We love our mother-in-law more than our mother." Colonel's daughter! Will you just fed the fish all day... ...or think about our meal too? [WATER SLOSHING] [SANSKRIT CHANTS] - Start it. - Yes. Mother, dig a hole and lay the foundation. - Why me? - You're strange! I've named this factory... ...'Respected Bhavani Devi Soap Factory'. Who else is greater than you for me? You give me so much respect, Lalla? Mother, he said he won't start this factory... ...if you don't lay the foundation. Absolutely. Not a leader or minister, but you'll inaugurate it. - Dig a hole. - Okay. Okay. [APPLAUSE] Lalla, you've taken a big responsibility. If you need anything else, do tell me. No, mother. Right now 20,000 are enough. And if I am short, I'll arrange from somewhere. Great, Lalla! Why will you beg others when I'm here? I'll give you 25,000. Okay? As you wish. Pen, mother. It's the first cheque. I'll write 30,000. Who can argue with you? Who can stop you? How dare you! Mother, you're signing one cheque after another. Think before spending. Who are you to stop me? Everything is mine. Not just money, I can give you the entire property. You can surely do that. But at least check that your money isn't misused. Wow! I started the construction work myself. I've laid the foundation. That's what I'm telling you. They've laid that foundation for you. This foundation is to mark your end. So that they can seize your entire property. Shobha! Call Pappu. We'll leave right now. Your husband is called a thief and a traitor. Let's go. Hurry up. Lalla! Lalla! I didn't say anything to you. Why do you listen to this witch? No, mother. Suspicion is very dangerous. It can ruin us any day. Son Pappu, come here. I swear on my son with God as my witness... ...that I'm investing your money for the right cause. Wretched girl! You accuse a simple man. Aren't you ashamed, witch! He won't go. You go away! Go or else I'll throw you out. Mother, I won't go without showing you the truth. She take the cheque book. Mother, how can I leave you in such a situation. Veena, you will get cured. Silli, make the food. I'm going out. Mother-in-law, Veena is ill. So what? She won't die. You're sitting idle making excuse of girl's ailment. Prepare the food. - Mother. - Yes, child? Granny always scolds you... ...because I'm a girl? No, child. No. Don't think that. Mother. If I die, granny won't be angry with you. No, child. May you live for a thousand years! I'll endure everything for you. Everything! Veena! Veena! Veena! Veena! Veena, say something. Veena! Uncle Sukhlal. Sister. What happened, sister? Veena won't say anything. God know what happened to my girl. Don't worry. Doctor is here. - Put the girl on the bed. - Come. Come. The girl is very serious. Admit her in a hospital immediately. I've given her an injection for the time being. Sukhlal. - Yes? - Distribute it among the poor. Okay, madam. Lalla, a ring on your wedding anniversary. Shobha, this is for you. And a golden chair for my darling Pappu. - Mother. - God bless you. Mother, you've given us gold on our wedding anniversary. Even my mother never celebrated such an anniversary. - Lalla, there can be no price on love and affection. - Mother. Silli! Serve the food. We're back. Son, let me see what granny gave to you. Okay. Fine. Mother, food isn't ready. Why? I had told Silli to prepare the food. What were you doing? Doctor had come, mother. Veena has fever. We need some money to take her to the hospital. I think this is your ruse. You won't get any money. You've no money for a child's treatment. What disaster has befallen on her? Hospital! Doctor! There is uproar in the entire house. She would've been fine with some herbal concoction. We were giving that to her till now. But the doctor said it's not an ordinary fever. It's typhoid. Won't you give us the money? No. Never. We've raised kids and seen ailments too. But I've no money to splurge. You've money to buy dress. You've money to make chain and ring. But you've no money for a kid's treatment. Mother, she too is your grandchild too. Stop this nonsense! If you are so sympathetic towards her... ...get money from your maternal house. I would have. But we've no time. Won't you give us the money? I said no. Mother, won't you give us the money? No. Lalla. Lalla. She... I've taken 500 rupees. Oh God! Oh God! She's become so arrogant. She has insulted mother so badly. Take it. Go and put shroud on the girl. You should be ashamed of yourself. I can't bear it. I can't bear it anymore, mother. Enough. It's the limit. - We had to be so humiliated. - Calm down. It's not mother's fault. But mother, allow us to leave now. No, no, Lalla. Why will you leave this house? She will leave, forever. She won't leave till she's alive, mother. If you want to get rid of her forever... ...you'll have to kill her. Mother, she's not a woman, but fire. She'll incinerate the entire house. What should I do now? No need to worry. The girl is fine now. - Sister, remove the saline. - Yes, doctor. Come will me. I'll prescribe the medicines. Durga, today Veena is alive because of you. I had no courage to face mother even at such a moment. Sister, you'll get the courage some day. When elders do atrocities... ...youngsters are forced to confront them. Bye. Mother will be wait for me. Found a solution! [CLEARING THROAT] Mother, I found a solution! Nobody can even doubt us even in their wildest dream. What's the solution? - Lizard's poison! - Oh God! - Natural death! - Oh dear! Is it necessary to kill her? Isn't there any other way to drive her out of the house? No, mother. Poison is the antidote for poison. Today she has slapped me. I fear she might slap you too in future. If you ready for it, let things continue as they are. Tell me, mother. Okay. Put it in, mother. Put it in, mother. Don't delay. Or she might come in. Put it in. She might come in. Durga. How is Veena now? She's fine. Doctor said there is nothing to worry now. Daughter. You did the right thing. I scolded you a lot in my anger at that time. Even Lalla repented a lot later on. Yes. Durga, please don't mind what I said. Mother, if everyone does the right thing in the house... ...it'll be the biggest joy for me. Can I go now, mother? I'm feeling very sleepy? What? How can you sleep without eating anything? Mother. I'm not hungry today. Why aren't you hungry? You shouldn't sleep hungry. Eat something. Then go to sleep. Shobha, bring sweet rice, vegetables and... ...fried bread in a bowl quickly. She'll bring it soon. Okay, mother. I'll get it. [TABLE CREAKS] Have it. Have it. Durga, don't just eat vegetables and fried bread. Have some sweet rice too. I've made it so well. - Lizard! - Lizard? No, no. - Where is the lizard? - In the plate. Lizard has helped its own species. Totaram, where are you going with your luggage? I'm fleeing from home. You just got married. You call it a marriage, uncle Ramu. I've got such a fat wife that if she massages my legs I can't walk properly. When she massages me, my bones hurt. When she applies oil on my head, my hair fall. That's enough, uncle Ramu. I can't bear it anymore. Please don't tell anyone that I'm fleeing. - Not even to Maina. - No, no. Don't ever tell Maina. - Okay. - Thanks. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Bye.

Lallan, I can't find my keys. You must've misplaced them. - Try to remember. - I remember it very well. I kept it below the pillow. I always keep them here. Strange! Keys disappeared from the house! - Shobha! Shobha! - What is it? Mother can't find her keys. - Have you seen them? - No. But mother, have you asked them? Are you crazy? Why will they take them? That day Durga took the keys, but in front of all. She took the money and returned you the keys. You'll find them, mother. Don't worry. Let's look for them. Sister, these colour looks nice on you. Please try it. Durga, this is your dress. I can't wear it. I'm your sister, so why do you treat me like an outsider? - It's not so. - Durga, I can't find my keys. Have you taken them? No, mother. Didn't I tell you that Durga wouldn't have taken the keys? Let's go and look there. [KEY'S JINGING] Here, mother. We found the keys. But how did it get in her box? Why don't you say something? Why are you quiet? - I don't know, mom. - Let it be. We found them in the house. We'll think of the rest later. But keep the keys safely from next time. Come. Come. Sister. Thank God some outsider didn't get the keys, mother. So we don't need to open the locker. - Locker? - Yes. If you doubt, you can check it. But I don't think Durga is such a girl. Still it is better to check, mother. Yes. You're right. Oh God! - Lalla. - What happened, mother? All my money and jewelleries are stolen. - Lalla. - Oh God! Oh God! Durga, what have you done? You've bitten the hand that fed you. Durga! Durga! Come here. Look at this. Tell me, where are the money and jewelleries? Money and jewelleries? I don't know. I know very well. You've stolen them. Mother, why are you falsely accusing Durga? Don't you know that she's been incriminated? Shut up! Lalla, call the police immediately. - We'll find the truth. - Let it be, mother. Durga is after all the daughter-in-law of this house. If outsiders come to know, our family will be defamed. Then ask her. Where are the money and jewelleries? I said I don't know. Junior madam. This sir wants to meet you. - You're Durga? - Yes. But who are you? - Yes. - She's Durga. But what do you want from her? I'm broker of jewellery market. Last night you came to Mangaldas jeweller... ...to assess the worth of your jewelleries. Maybe you forgot this necklace there in a hurry. This is a lie. - Mother, is this your necklace? - Yes, Lalla. Yes. Everything is proved now. Nothing is left. Call the police immediately. Oh God! [DIALER TONE] Police station. Constable, take this. So you suspect your younger daughter-in-law... - ...Durga is the thief? - Yes. She's the thief. No, inspector. It's a false accusation. Let us decide that. Mrs. Durga, you've to come to police station with us. - And you too? - Okay. - To testify. - Sure. - Come. - Durga. I feared that someday the hatred in this house... ...with hurt you too. Those who are guilty have to fear, sister. But innocent ones can never be harmed. Don't worry. Mrs. Durga Chowdhary is released on your bail. And you may know that she can't leave the town... ...until the court doesn't give its verdict. Sign here. Durga. I know it's not your fault. I feared that they might put you in a big problem. I don't regret that. But I am regretful as mother is badly plundered. But when will mother realize it? When will she understand you? Come. Wow! Wow! Wow! Mother, these sweets taste more delicious. [LAUGHING] Veena, come here. - What is it, granny? - Have some sweets. I won't eat it. You got my aunt arrested. - I won't eat it. - Witch! How dare you! - Will you do it again? - Mother. - Tell me. - Why are you hitting my daughter? How has she harmed you? I gave her sweets to eat. But she threw it on Lalla. A small kid is accusing her granny. She isn't lying. You falsely accused Durga and got her arrested. Wow! Even you've started replying. Let's see who comes to your rescue today! Didn't I tell you that I won't leave... ...without finishing my work? You can even try... ...to accuse me of murder, not just theft. Come, sister. 'Murder charge!' [WATER SLOSHING] Mother! - Mother! - Yes, Lalla. I'm going to the city. So would you like me to get something from there? No. I don't want anything. But when will you return? I am not sure how much time will it take. Sometimes the work gets done quickly. Sometimes it takes time too. Still, return quickly after completing the work. You know the police have released the colonel's daughter. We still didn't get those money and jewelleries. Mother, Durga was released on bail. Don't worry. She'll surely get imprisoned. And you'll get your belongings. - No. - Mother. - [GLASS BEKING] - [WATER SLOSHING] - You had a narrow escape, mother. - Mother, are you hurt? - I don't know how it fell. - You wanted to kill her. But God willed something else. Our saviour is the greatest. Mother! Like these fish even you would've been... ...wriggling to your death, mother. This... Lalla... The tank didn't fell. But it was made to fall. Mother, if you die, they will get all your wealth. As long as you own all these things... ...your life is in danger at every step. For my wealth... ...they... they want to kill me. Mother, if you bequeath your wealth... ...to someone else... ...nobody can kill you. Yes. Then what will they get by killing me? I'll ask the lawyer to make a will. And I'll bequeath you all my property. That's it. The will is ready, madam Bhavani. Take this. - Sign here. - Okay. I hand you the responsibility of the house from today, Lalla. Now see, mother. I will teach every one nice lesson. Why are you so depressed? Won't you go to work? Nothing is left there for us now. Mother has willed everything to Khopchand. She made us his slave. Everything will be fine. Brother-in-law! You didn't go to work today. It's fine if you don't want to go. You're on leave today. But brother-in-law, I'm going to bank. Polish my shoes. Is my dad your servant? Why will he polish your shoes? Wow! Father is too timid to say anything. But this small kid is yelling! Beware! Leave my kid. Then tell your husband to polish my shoes. What? He'll polish your shoes. Who else will do it? I've fired Sukhlal. Yes, madam. Now you'll have to do all the house chores. Khopchand, mind your tongue. I'll do that. You take my shoes. - Polish it. - Scum! You! What's going on? You've raised your hand on Lalla. Mother, cancel your will and let me go. No, no, Lalla. I've willed everything to you after deliberation. Mahesh! You'll have to listen to Lalla. Why don't you say that I'll have to obey him? Yes, you'll have to obey him. We won't live here to obey him. Come on, Veena. Yes. Come, Sheila. We can't live here now. Where are you going? Out of this prison to breathe in fresh air. You don't have to go. Lalla never says anything wrong. No, he is always right. Even you are always right. I always saw injustice done on my wife but... ...I never said a word. Enough. That's it. I can't keep quiet anymore. Come, Sheila. Wait. You can't go. - Move aside, mother. Let us go. - Shut up! You back answer me. Let me see how to step out of this house. You've lost the right to order me, mother. The leg, which you had burnt, has got strength now. Now it won't stumble. How dare you! Sir, come with me. My house is your house too. - Uncle Sukhlal. - Listen. Don't refuse, madam. Come, child. Come, sir. Who are you? What do you want? - You're the broker of jewellery market. - What's the matter? You know, you had brought the necklace in the mansion? Necklace? Which necklace? - Don't know. - No. Sir, he doesn't remember the necklace. - No? - No. Poor fellow got hurt. You don't know? Now? No. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Khopchand gave me that necklace. - Really? - Yes. - Rest of the jewelleries? - Other jewelleries? Which one? - You don't know? - No. - You don't know? - Yes. Tell me. Wait. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. That... Khopchand gave those jewelleries to Kesar. Listen, brother. I am not brother, but Patanga. - Tell me. - No, it's nothing. I wanted to meet someone else. Listen. Can't I help you? No, brother. I mean sister. I mean sister-in-law. - What can I say? - Tell me, what do you want? Don't feel shy. - Do you want to meet madam Kesar? - Yes. Do you know her? Go. I won't tell you. - Please tell me. - I won't tell you. Listen, if you help me meet her... ...I'll please you too. - Really? - Yes. Really. - From how far do you want to meet her? - Far? What do you mean? 20 rupees to see her from 20 meter distance. - Rs.50 to meet from so near. - I will give you Rs.100. - Bravo, dear! - Help me! - Totaram, what is going on? - Help! Help me! Help me! Sir. Sir. He's Kesar's secretary. He was frisking me. - Kesar's secretary. - Yes. Oh God! 2 men. You've to pay more money for 2 men. More money! My foot! Do you know him? - Who are you? - CID. CID. Oh God! - Crime branch. - Crime branch? Oh God! I'm stuck. Take your money back. Bye. Where are you going, queen? - Won't you take us to madam Kesar? - No. I don't know. - Do you know? - No. - Do you? - Yes. - Then come on. - Why are you manhandling me? - Come. - Oh God! Leave me. You are two and I'm alone. Khopchand. Who is Khopchand? I don't know, sir. Listen, madam Kesar. Our men have surrounded this house. - If you don't tell us about the jewelleries... - Okay. Okay. - Those jewelleries? - Yes. Yes. Those jewelleries. But Khopchand has taken them back. Sister, they're CID. Listen, madam Kesar. If you try to act smart with us... ...you'll rot in prison for all your life. - Totaram. Handcuff her. - Okay. No, no, sir. I'll tell you. But sir, I hope we won't get in any trouble. We're poor. If you help us, we'll save you. - I've the jewelleries. - Good. I will get them. - Totaram. - Yes? Go inside with her. Me? Thank you, sir. Thank you. Take this, sir. But sir, take care of us. We will. We always will. - And forever. - Totaram, come. Yes, sir. [FOOTSTEPS] Give us the jewelleries. Jewelleries? Okay. Sir, give them the jewelleries. Take it, brother. Jewelleries. You! Want to get arrested? Now get lost. Go! Me? Actually... God! Save me. God! Save me from him. Sir. Well done. Well done. - Good job! - Come. Wait. Let me cool him down. He was severely thrashed. Cool down. - Totaram. - Coming, sir. Wait a minute. What are you saying? - How do they know? - I don't know. He thrashed everyone here. Me too. - Maybe they went to the police station. - Police! 'If the old woman finds out, she'll change her will.' Mother, the jewelleries are found. - Jewelleries are found. - Yes. - Jewelleries are found. - Yes. Hurry up. - Where are they? - I'll tell you. Hurry up. [FOOTSTEPS] Durga, we've the jewelleries. Where is mom? Khopchand took mother along. He too was saying that jewelleries are found. But we've the jewelleries. - Where could Khopchand have taken mom? - I think it's fishy. I think mom's life is in danger. Come on. Tell me, mother. Do you have any trouble here? By the way, this place is very quiet and safe. Back home everyone wanted to kill you. So I've brought you away from them. Now you won't get to see those scoundrels. You're a scoundrel. Impostor. You made me drive away my children. You incited me against my noble daughters-in-law. Why? Why did you betray me? Scum! How much more sin will you commit? Go away. Go away from here. Go away. [GATE CLOSES] - What? - Brother, God knows here Khopchand took mother. Her life is in danger. I saw them going towards the storehouse. - Let's go. - Yes. Come. - Where's mother? - Mother. Durga. Durga! Scum! Tell me, where is mother? Tell me, where is mother? [SCREAMING] No! Where is mother? Where is mother? Tell me, where is mother? Tell me, where is mother? Tell me, where is mother? - Father-in-law, should I hit him too? - Yes. Tell me, where is mother? - Mother is in the storehouse. - Get lost! Open the door. - Brother, the chain is broken. - How will the door open? [DIGGING] [SCREAMING] Mother! Mother! Mother! - Mother. - Mother. [SPITTING] Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. Durga! Doctor. How is Durga now? I can't say anything for sure now. Doctor, can her life be in danger by sucking out poison? Because of chapped lips the poison has... - ...spread in the body with her blood. - Doctor. Please doctor. - We are trying our best. - Thank you. Doctor, save my daughter-in-law at any cost. Brace yourself. If she survives the night, she'll be out of danger. Doctor, can I see my daughter-in-law from here. - Just once. - Okay. 'God, don't do this injustice!' 'Don't take her life in place of this sinner's life, God.' 'Durga is innocent, God.' 'Change your decision. Change your decision, God.' Take my life. But save Durga... ...my, child and the daughter-in-law of my house, God. Save her! Save her, God! [CLOCK TICKING] [CLOCK BELL RINGING] [CLOCK TICKING] Doctor. Mother. [CLOCK BELL RINGING] - Doctor. - Doctor. Doctor, how is Durga now? She's out of danger. No need to worry now. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Doctor. Doctor. We're grateful to you. - Doctor. - Our treatment and your blessings gave... ...a new life to Durga. Thank you, doctor. She's regaining consciousness. - You can go inside. - Okay. Durga. Durga. Durga. Mother. Durga. My lady luck. Durga. Mother. - Durga. - Mother. My lady luck. Durga. God bless you, daughters. No mother-in-law can be fortunate than me. I've daughters-in-law who are virtuous and kind. - Mother-in-law. - Don't call me mother-in-law but, mother. You both are my daughter. Right, Silli. Oh no! Sheila! Mother, every girl comes to her husband's house... ...leaving the shelter of her maternal house. If in-laws take the place of parents... ...they won't miss their parents in their husbands' house. Mother. Mother, your son-in-law is here too. He was running away. But I caught him. Should we take him to prison? Don't ask me. Ask Durga. She has done lots of injustice on Durga. Leave him. Durga, you're really an angel. - Forgive me. - No, no. Don't embarrass me by saying that. Today I've fulfilled the desire with which I came here. I got your blessings, mother. [CHUCKLES] - Shall we go now? - Where? I won't let you go. - What about my job? - Quit your job. Now all of you will live here. And... ...you will take the responsibility of this house. - Take this, daughter. - No, mother. This is your right. We just need your love and affection. Wow! "May our mother-in-law have a long life!" "May our mother-in-law have a long life!" "We love our mother-in-law more than our mother." "Our mothers gave us birth." "But you gave us our beloveds." "Our mothers gave us birth." "But you gave us our beloveds." "You are great, mother-in-law!"
