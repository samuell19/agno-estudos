No, no, no! Don't turn your head. Just your eyes. - Here? - No. Sister, The doctor is coming. Dear, how is Jiya? She doesn't clearly remember things from the recent past. Your doubt was right. Ya. She doesn't rememberthings from the past mo yean. I conducted a brain response test. That's how we confirmed that she has memoy loss. In 900/o ofthe cases, it is temporay. It might be because of the shock from that accident. You know right? If she gets her hands on a car, Jiya turns into a racing car driver. Did you get the car she drove during the accident, uncle? No. The police enquiy is on. Finding the car is not important.. What's important is getting her memoy back. Jiya doesn't have many close friends. You are not just her best friend, but also a role model to her as well. So you're the one who should give us our old Jiya back. You know that her wedding is fixed, right? Yes. l haven't seen the groom. I thought l'll meet him during the engagement. My God! He is the guy!! 100 years! This is Jiya's fiance, Mr. Ravi. This is the doctor treating Jiya right now. Not that Major Ravi. E Ravi. - Eravi? - Not Eravi.. What is Jiya's doctor? No! You're going to name a disease which we would never understand, right? L've heard enough ofthat. So that's not necessay. - Does she have memoy or not? - No. That's all l want to know. All ofyou wait here. L'll make her alright! Over there. She is vey disturbed. She may become violent too. Don't be tensed, dear. He will take care of it! Long back, in Sri Lanka, you know IPKF? During that, his father saved my life! I gave him a promise that day. That his son will mary my daughter! He has pe_ectly acquired his father's skill. He will take care of it right away! Wait 8 watch! - Help!! What happened? Didn't l tell you that she will be moody? When l said that l'm Ravi and if she recogniMd me, her reaction was like she saw a rapist! When l held her hand asking why she was staring at me, Doctor, one minute. Come. She rememben certain things vey clearly. Long back, while we were in school, l had casually peeped into her toilet while she was bathing. She threw that glass on me asking if l was that peeping Tom! You peeped? Sheesh! Aren't you an army o_icer? When l was studying in 8th standard, l wasn't in the army, right? So she remembers that alone, vey vividly. After that, l ioined the army, killed our enemies, and our wedding got fixed. And she rememben none ofthat. Eveything is in place. Those memories haven't gone anywhere. I thinkthis is a temporay memoy loss. - When will it become permanent? - Huh? I mean.. When would Jiya come back to her life permanently? It can happen any time. Something or someone who is close to her heart; if she sees them or hears their voice, that maybe enough! But it didn't come back when she heard my voice! Tell me doctor! It can be someone else, right? A close friend, a relative; Boyfriend? Apart from me? Whom? So you planted these pear saplings, uncle? Oh, it's tea? - Give me the key. - Oh dear.. Dear, that's not our car. It belongs to a guest. L'll be heartbroken if l don't take it for at least one spin! Dear, don't take it. What ifthe owner comes now? - What's going to happen now! - Gosh! L've just heard of people going cray when they lose memoy. Now l know for sure. - L was just quoting an example. - Don't you know? If she sees a new model car, she doesn't bother about anything and speeds away! I hope she comes back before the guest comes. I doubt it. This is Mr. Menon. The manager. This is Mr. Ravi. Sir, the bookings are really low this month. Any promotion programmes? Let it be, Menon. I'm really tensed about my daughter. You do as you please. Let me be free. Okay sir. Got it. We'll manage. I don't know what to tell you or how to solve this. And, the doctor has specially told us that, you shouldn't emotionally disturb Jiya by asking too many questions. I will solve all the problems! This is Mathews. Him? - Isn't he your relative? - Yes. What is he going to do? Yes. He is our relative and a close friend of mine. And notiust that, Mathews is an excellent private detective as well. How can he solve a problem which even the doctor couldn't? I don't think you know him well enough. He has ten brains! A 'Ravana' incarnate! Where are the other nine brains? - They went for a walk. The world famous private detective Brett Lee is his professor. - Ravi, enough! - No, let me.. Don't overdo it, please. You know, uncle? The two famous detective novels which are a regular feature on the fortnightly, 'The Kolkota Knife' and 'Soman, 10 years, brown skin'; - He has written them both. - Ganga!! - What is it, dad? - Come here, Ganga. Your mom is calling you. - You can play after lunch. The actual ghost in Madamballi house, - Huh? - Ghost? Oh.. Err.. I iust said that in a flow. L've got a lead in Jiya's case. Is it? What lead? Without Jiya's knowledge, OfyOUfS, l searched her room. I spoke to some of her friends as well. Has she mentioned anything about a 'P' to you? You mean the English alphabet 'P'? Yes. 'Pa' in English, 'P' in Malayalam, - And in Hindi? - 'Pu'.. I didn't get you. In the notepads l found in Jiya's room, 'to meet P, P called, worried about P'.. Was written quite o_en. Some of her college friends also had a doubt that there was such a 'P'. There is someone in her life with a nickname called 'P'. Or maybe a name starting with that letter; l'm sure about that. 'P'. That's me! Emmanuel Maior Ravi. Where is 'P' in that? 'Pattarumadam'. The house name! - There's P in that, right? - There's P in that. But your house name is 'Kuriyedath', right? Yes. But you have to cross Pattarumadam to reach my house! So, a_er Pattarumadam, from Kuriyedathu house, Emmanuel Ravi. P.E.K. Ravi. Okay? I am that 'P'. - No. - Yes! Who is that? Where is he from? L.. I have a garage in the foothills. And Jiya is the reason behind that. We are in love. P for Prince. My brother owns 4-5 boats in Mangalore. I visit him once in a while. I was there, when l heard that Jiya had an accident and lost her memoy. If someone did this deliberately, that bast__$.. How can Jiya love someone like me? Isn't that what you were thinking right now? Isn't evey love stoy like that, Sir? Even in my case, it was almost the same. That's what this 'P' is saying. This is vey confusing. We shall ask her. - Jiya! - Jiya is not here. Another 'P' has taken her along. Another 'P'? Do you recogniM me? Pranav's friend. When the accident happened, Pranav wasn't in town. His usual business trip. You always complained about these sudden trips of his. Do you remember this song? It's his favourite song. P for Pranav? What name did the other guy say? Prince for P. Sory. P for Prince. Have you seen him? Do you know him? Do you remember anything? I think l've seen him somewhere. Uncle, you don't have to believe all this! When he sang in the co_ee shop, Jiya said that she remembered something. L'll also sing. Let's see if she remembers something. And, when she saw Prince's photo, the same thing happened. So, she would've at least seen them somewhere. She saw you in 8th standard, right? And newer saw you again! Don't insult me! Why don't you ask your friends? No! Many more such frauds would come if she does that! No one else should know about my condition. And don't ask anyone about this. Please. I'm going to sleep. - Me too. - Mathews! I was talking about sleeping at my home. Move! Jose Mathirangkandathil. From Kattappana. From the Gulf, he has been doing many businesses, money transactions, Recruitment agency, and many other things, for several years. All of them are bogus. He cheated many people there and has landed here. We haven't been able to arrest him due to the lack of evidence. So we should find evidence against him. L've summoned you for that, Sameer. Study all the details. His properties, houses of his relatives; places he visits; eveything should be mapped. You might find a lead somewhere or the other. His victims have mostly been Malayalis. People with small-time jobs in the Gulf, ordinay people; people who wanted to double their limited savings. Forthem, we must nab him! But still, how is this possible? You just have to cut the banana, wrap it in gram flour; and dip it in oil 8fy it. What? To make banana fritters! Sheesh! Dude, who took you into the army? Or did they hatch you over there? I was talking about memoy loss. Oh! Okay. Eveywhere, women are the ones who lose memoy. Even in movies. Who said so? My wife's memoy is increasing day by day instead. How long l've been praying!! Whatever! What about our plan? What's the next step? Pay the bill. Pay the bill 8 come, man! J Ravi there's not just one, but two roadblocks in your way. The 'P' whom uncle met. And another 'P' whom Jiya met. P-P (trumpet) Are they trumpet players or what? That, l don't know. But ifthings proceed like this, the both of them will make you blow... What? Trumpet! And you might have to play the drums too! When one of them marries your girl. I don't know how to play a trumpet. My item was 'flute'. While l was in the army, during the evenings; l used to play the 'flute', for all the soldiers who came tired a_er their duties. - What happened to this guy? That was our only entertainment. What happened to you? Mathews, even if there are anymore Ps or Qs in Jiya's life; it's a Yes for me! What do you mean? I am okay with it! She is their only daughter. And she has wealth worth crores of rupees. I won't let her go. She is my life! Lfthis Eravazhanji river belongs to theArabian sea, - Which one? This? - Ya. What are you saying, man? This is the waste water flowing from that hotel. And it will flow to that drainage over there. - You 8 yourfilmy dialogues! - My mood is spoilt! You don't wory. Let me enquire about them both. L'll find out who's P and who's Q among them. You relax. And ya, were you serious about that 'flute' thing? Yes, and l'm proud of it! - Is it? - Yea. Come. That idiot detective is watching you. - L saw him. - Okay, start! Like evey other girl, Jiya was also cray about chocolates. You know Florence chocolate shop near Curson Pa_? Over there, she used to close her eyes, taste chocolates; and guess which flavour it was. She was cray about that. Bro, Let me start over once again from here. I hope she considen me a friend at least. What is this, dude? Ever since Jiya's accident, you haven't been able to concentrate on your business, right? Without Jiya, it's meaningless to do anything! There is no business orwealth, which is bigger than her for me. Even ifyou ask me a 1000 times to choose bemeen my wealth and Jiya, l have iust one answer. Jiya. Oh my God! Don't tickle me! It's not a flute? Lfthere was a magic Iamp among all these, l would've rubbed it and brought back her memoy. I mistook you. Brother, is there any way to bring back old memories through.. Some devices or tricks and... - Magic spells? - Yes! Ancient scriptures! - Are there any? - Yes. Sure. Really? I think it should be there. From Harappa - Mohenjo Daro? No way! And then, Mesoppottamian.. And there, way back to.. 11 32 BC, Or... 132 BC? Right? You... Was it 22 BC? - Ravi! Let me check. Bloody idiot! What happened dude? What did you find out? Can't you stop chewing and ask me what happened to me, and what did l find out? Didn't l ask you the same thing? Why are you shouting for that? Am l deaR Bhutan? Why should l go to Bhutan? - What are you saying, Ravi? - Mathews.. Since you're not asking, l'll tell you. I saw that guitarist fellow. Speak so_ly. The others might hear. Vomit? Why should l vomit here? What happened to you actually? One has lost her memoy and the one who went to enquire became deaf! My God, why are you testing me? - Ravi, let me talk to you! - Later! Now he wants to go to Punnapra? Wait! Hey Maior. Hey Maior Ravi.. Hey, l met one 'P'. - Now l'm going to meet the other 'P'. - Do whatever you want! Brother, someone's coming behind you! He's saying something. Listen to him! - Deaf 8 mad people all around! - Oh. He's deaR Hello? He's your friend, right? If he's deaf, buy a hearing aid for him! He won't have to suffer so much! Lfyou need good muscles, you must go to the gym. I can't hear anything.. Stay there. So sad. Even his condition is pathetic. Where is he planning to go? I won't leave you. God, no kicker? Why are you coming bemeen my legs? That too when l'm in a hury.. 'Karunalaya Mental Health Centre' What is he doing here? Who among you is mad? - What? - Who among you is mad? It's me. I thought so. Welcome. Don't throw it at me. Please. He was throwing it at the mango? Sir, have you read this? L've seen all this in WhatsApp. The mad men are not kept in cells here or what? Don't go. l'm a doctor. Come! Come here. You thought l'm a mad man when you saw me? Sit. Are you drunk? My state of mind is such.. I will prescribe some anti-depressants. You'll be find ifyou have that. I don't need anti-depressants, doctor. Then what do you want? You want to die? Suicide is never a solution to any problem. I wished to live a life which l dreamt of, with a girl l loved, doctor. I will never consider suicide. Then what is the problem? My next patient is waiting. Tell me what your problem is. L've seen this in a movie.. Or.. l don't remember if it was in a book.. Atechnique which can erase memories. If she doesn't remember me, even l want to become like that. You want to forget her? Then? To meet again as strangen. Get acquainted; and to make new memories. My God! ALIJ.. There were two? Jiya. Sicily, the doctor is calling you. Go to the 3rd block. Take this guy to the shock room. Does such pure love exist even now? Sir, don't su_er standing. You can sit 8 su_er. L'll walk 8 su_er. How.. I don't know how to console you.. In fact, there's no such system here. And, That's the only way out. How many ofthat should l have daily, doctor? What? This medicine. It's not a medicine. It's the name of a hospital. This is so strange. When the guitarist is reminiscing about chocolates, this guy wants to create new memories. It's him! Shall we go? Shall we go? If so, please drop me near the gate. Isn't the gate on that side? Did you lose the way? No, we're going to the right place. But why are you going inside again? Don't shout! l'll drop you. I don't have to go there. That's what eveyone says over here. There he goes again. What happened? Your face? I'm writing a report for you. That's okay. But why are you making these strange faces in bemeen? Don't bother about it. l got shock treatment. It'll go away in 2 days. What about your investigation? L'll tell you.. My investigation has covered almost all the areas. I traveled through many routes like a mad man. That we understood when we saw you. Tell us the matter! Let me complete. My inference is that.. Or you can call it my conclusion, lf one is Shahjahan, the other is Pareekkutty. - Mathews! - Stop! Both ofthem loved Jiya sincerely in their own ways. - No! - You!! One is a millionaire! Stopping all his businesses and leaving all his wealth; he is in a lot of pain tying to find his way into Jiya's memories. And the other one, wants to erase his own memories, and become like Jiya. They both would give their life forJiya! She is like their lifeline, their heartbeat. - Bullshit! - Correct! If she's a tree, they are her branches! Get lost you dog! Jiya isn't like that. Didn't you hear him, uncle? Are you saying this under the influence of marijuana or something? Never! I found this a_er going through a lot oftorture. 1000/o true. Both ofthem are pe_ect. The fault is with your daughter! - YOU! - Move! One who romances or even fakes romance with mo pe_ect gentlemen; cheating them both for time-pass alone; by going around with them both; an absolute slut... He is tying to get such a girl married o_ to you; you idiot!! Gun! Gun! Why should l fail? Aren't you the one who failed? Not that. There's a gun behind you. Look! How dare you say such nonsense about my only daughter? That too, being my own relative? I'm saying this because l'm your relative. This should be pointed at your daughter! Hasn't the doctor told us not to disturb her with such emotional things? But how can l keep it in my mind? If l have a tension in my mind, l can't relax until l share itwith someone. I had to tell you Jiya, because l need to prove that; that bloody Mathews is wrong! You should prove that he was lying, yourself. You are MY daughter! It's not as if you will never love someone; but l know that you won't do anything that l don't like, without my permission. Two people together... That's not my girl! You should talk to both ofthem. Listen to what they have to say. We'll know what their roles are in my daughtefs life. Is that necessay, daddy? Won't they.. - Won't they leave a_er some time? - No. As far as l know, l don't think they would go. Don't you want to know the truth? Will there be a problem? Interacting with mo people.. She is a colonel's daughter. And they know that vey well. Nothing will happen. But still.. That.. What you said is true. Hey.. What if one ofthem is actually her lover? Nancy, what if interacting with them, can help in bringing back her memoy? And what if her memoy comes back? I know how to send them away! LfJiya gets married, that will only be to Ravi. The most important thing for an army-man is his promise. Got it? Oh dear Lord! Please save my child! I was a goon. An orphan who was left stranded. I grew up in the railway colony here. And what l studied was, to do anything to make a living! Since l was ready to do anything; l was taken under the wings of a king who ruled the city back then. And considered me a younger brother. He was the one who gave me the name - Prince. The King's son. And eveything l did was for him, from then on.. Hearing about me, and seeing me at many places; what you had for me initially was, curiosity. The fascination of seeing a goon in real life. Slight contempt. Some fear. It is still etched in my mind, like a Tamil movie. What are you doing? Brother Prince, my mother is really unwell. Can you give me some money to take her to the hospital? - You have any money? - No, bro. - You? - No. And you? Gosh! Come. Do you have any money? No. No? I swear! My dad is in the militay. So? So, l don't get much pocket money. - Don't take it. - Her mother is unwell. Lfyou lose a chain, it will come back. But if a mother's life is lost, it will never come back. I will return this chain to you. It is Prince's promise. L'll send my guys to fix the puncture. You can keep this. I lied to mom that l lost the chain. And now l can't take it back home. You can give this to them. They're poor, right? Lfyou want to do something for someone, do it yourself. Sometime lateryou told me, what l said backthen, that was what attracted you to me. Then, you wanted to introduce me to yourfamily. I tried to evade that many times. Your birthday.. It was a pam at the Army club with all the army-men in town. The man who saved your father's life; his son was there too. What was his name? Ya. Ravi. It's nice to hear these army stories, right? My papa used to put me to sleep with his army stories. Once, a soldier's mo legs was smashed under a paton tank. And a rocket which pierced through a man's skull, landed on a riverwith his left eye.. These stories were like lullabies to me. Listening to them, l sucked my finger and slept. Even a_er our marriage, you should narrate stories like this to me. Lying on your lap.. You got emotional? I know.. That's what l said.. - Go pierce your eyes and come. - Huh? I mean, wash your eyes 8 come. How long have l been waiting for you? Why are you so late? Sit. Sit on the bike. - Where are you taking me? - To kill you. SIT! You look prem today. I said you look pretty. I don't know how to say this. Shall l mary you? Are goons so romantic? Why? Do you want to ty one? I didn't have the brains to do that in my good old days. What can l do now? Lfthe goon's romance is in this range, what about the guitarist? What all do you have to say? When did you see me fint; how did you chase me around; and where did you propose to me? Tell me. Let me hear it. You don't have to hear it with such an attitude. L'll tell you sometime later. What was our love stoy? How did you follow me around? Where did you propose to me? It wasn't me; who followed and proposed. It was you! Already 7 missed calls. I have to go. Who is this Prabhu Deva? Shall we invite him for our college day? - For training? - Yes. Him? Do you know who he is? - Who is he? - His name is Pranav. Have you heard of AJ Foundations? It's a huge business group. It's a huge set-up. He's the owner ofthat group. Vey down to earth. And he also has a craze like you. Car racing. It's 9 o'clock! Daddy will kill me. So soon? Didn't l tell you while coming? I have to leave at the correct time. That's not done! Didn't we come with you? So come. Let's go. Enough ofthis. L'll ioin you guys! You're leaving so soon? Let's go. Oh. l didn't introduce you. This is Jiya. Her dad's an ex-militay guy. So there's a cu_ew at home. She's really scared of her dad. Pranav, ask her to stay a little longer. Because of her, we have a cu_ew now. I won't say that. The girls in our county are safe to an extent, only because a few such strict fathers still exist. And you, who're tying to follow it.. To Jiya 8 her father! Oh God, he seems to be more traditional than your dad! While you were studying MBA in Ernakulam, we saw each other several times. So, there was a slight friendship bemeen us. - You're reading a book? - Ya. Lfyou're free, we can walk around in the lawn; crack someiokes and have fun!! I'm not in the mood. Daddy is calling. To play a game. - Come. - You wannajoin? I think this mat is old. What is this? Get lost you idiot! You've set up someone to clap for you, Pranav? Good going! One day, you invited me for your birthday pam. Take it. Must be a costly gift. - Take it. - Enough. Stop it. So seeing your wealth, car 8 diamond gifts, l proposed to you? My family isn't that bad either. No. Never. You're a girl with a solid character. Then what? I'm still standing there with the gi_. Can you open it? I'm not really fond of these costly gi_s. Just open it 8 see. L've been wanting a pet for a long time. Where do l.. Did you like the gi_? Really? Of coune! Then, set it free.. I didn't gi_ you the dove. I gi_ed you its freedom. How is it? Shall l tell you something? The stoy that one guy told, could've happened to me. He saw me in the church.. A fascination towards a goon. Realising his kindness... But what the other guy told.. It was too much of a romantic stoy.. Like a Hindi film.. Song, dance, adventure and all that.. I don't even know what to do.. It's as if l'm going mad. Amnesia is also a kind of madness. We shall do something. The goon's stoy.. I mean, the incidents he narrated.. What ifyou tell all that to Pranav? What if they know each othe_ Orwe could get some other lead also.. What is this? Why are you walking around with this? Evey private detective has this thing with them. What is it for? Dude, ifyou look through this, any idiot can be seen as a big shot! Mathews, you are a big shot! Brother, tea.. Have it.. And.. Hey, hey.. Come here. Don't do that! - Not nice? - You'll get nicely! And you might even get killed! I noticed even when you came here last time. You were ogling at the maid girl.. What are you saying? I stopped all that long back! In a family with a tradition ofwan, a complete 'ceasefire' is not possible! Ceasefire? Hey, l'm warning you! Her brother is in the district iail. That too, for a stabbing case. Political murder. He is my client as well. He has le_ her here because he trusts me. If he knows that you're ogling at her, that's enough for him. He'll come out on parole, kill you and go back to jail! Leave all that. What do you think about the stories they told? I'm coming to that, Mr. Major Ravi. - When a film shoot happens, - Film shoot? Sory. l thought you were the other Major Ravi. When both these love stories were happening, where were you? I am there in both these stories. That's the beauty of it. The birthday pam in the goon's stoy. I was there during that. You were? So such a pam happened. So what he's saying is true. Ya. Many such parties have happened. You would've bored hertelling her your army stories there.. No way. That's where the problem lies. I don't remember that. Party is fine. Me being in that party is also fine. But ifyou ask me if all those things happened.. Similarly, the club which the other guy mentioned.. - With the ball 8 stick? - Yes. I go to the club and sometimes l check out that stick too. But you don't remember ifthings happened the way Jiya told you. Exactly. The club happened, the party happened; she was there, you were there too.. And all ofthis happened for real. - But you don't.. - Rememberthat.. Is it? Are you making the payment in cash or as a cheque? You tell me the matter. What is your conclusion? - She didn't lose her memoy. - Then? You did! Start the treatment today itself. They have found a new medicine in Homeopathy.. What happened? Do you know Prince? Prince. No. I don't know him.. But.. This stoy.. Stoy? I'm not saying it's a stoy. But what if it is? What? I didn't get you. Do you have half an hour to spare? To go somewhere. This is a friend of mine. He's tying to write scripts for movies. This is Jiya. Before we start, let me tell you something. I'm not saying this is what it is, but it can be! What? Please tell me the matter. Go sit there. Sit down. This Prince, floated and reached a slum from somewhere..

Get coffee. You can go. Setting the dove free was fine, but don't you think you overdid it, when you said you also flew around in the sky? You're the one who cooked up a stoy by mixing 'Titanic' with 'Thalapathy'. Don't overdo it! How come you didn't say 'Rajumon asked me, what my name was 8 l said Prince', as well? I forgot that. But l'm going to say that now. What is this, dude? Jiya. l had it tattooed for her! Where would you have tattooed if her name was Lakshmi Gopalaswami? Over here.. L'll do it here, man! And l'll reveal all your lies and prove that my louwe is true! Not louwe. Love. Learn to speak properly first. Ya right! You bloody romantic hero! 15 days from today.. 15 days from today will be a strike by CPl(M). Ty moving it one ortwo days earlier or later. Okay. 14th day from today. Is that fine? Get lost man! Like those old mythological movies from Udaya Studio. You bloody 'King's son', just rememberthis. The second Jiya gets her memoy back, you will be out! When did you become 'in' for that? Why did you come here now? Dude, any loser can do photoshop now. - Show me. - L will. This is her purse. And this is our photo. - Co_ee. - Oh the ugly venion of Shobhana is here again! Don't make plans sipping co_ee 8 watching Padmarajan's movies! Whatever you plan, l'll be around the corner to destroy it. - Wherever you go.. - Woodhouse? Not woodhouse. Wherever you go, l am there. You are just Pranav. I am Prince. The King's son. Move ifyou don't want to die under my bike. Whatever you plan, l'll be around the corner to destroy it. J Swami - Swami? - Huh? Who are you? What do you want? Shouldn't you be checking the horoscope? That's what l was also thinking. That l had forgotten something. So you don't know anything about all this? What are you saying? I was born to a family which had astrologers forthe last 3 generations. But sometimes, l lose my memoy. That's a small problem that l have. You lose your memoy? Best! My God! Why are you sending these people to me? What is your problem? You solve your problem. Bloody astrologerwithout any memoy! Look at that scam on his neck! And calling himself new generation! A true Christian is following astrologen 8 magicians now? It's really sad, you army-man! You shut up! Hey, stop! L've come up with a great plan. That will be also screwed up. And you'll end up being deaf or mad! And they will keep scoring in the meanwhile. Get lost! That's why l've made a plan which goes in the same route as theirs. Their routes reached her, right? And didn't she listen to whatever they had to say? She listened; and it worked. This is also like that. It will work. Get on the bike. Do you have the height to ride a bullet? I had an urgeto say this truth out loud several times. But as a militay-man, l controlled myself. Tell us the matter, Ravi. The girl whom l loved the most, lost her memoy. The girl who wanted to mary me lost her memoy. Even then l had this urge to say this.. And l controlled myself. Two frauds came from nowhere told random stories, and stirred her mind. L.. I was out of her life.. Even then l had this urge to say this.. Lfyou want to say something, say it.. Or else, get some medicines for this urge of yours. Let me complete. When they narrated their stories, didn't you listen to them? My God! So you also have a stoy to tell which she has forgotten? What stoy? See? Even Mummy understood. But you haven't understood. Dear, didn't you have a much more romantic relationship with Ravi, than what they told you in their stories? Ravi, isn't that what you're going to say? Hold your head high and narrate your love stoy! Let us hear it. Attention. - Yes Sir! - Not to you! I was asking them to pay attention. Now start.. A little space to tell my stoy.. One day backthen.. A rainy day.. The day uncle 8 aunty had gone for a pam at rifle club. As you called me to bring Jiya also to the party, l went to take her. There was a soothing chilled breeze on that day. That cold breeze had the frangrance of a Plumeria flower. But there are only Bougainvilleas there.. Yes. The fragrance of a bloomed Bougainvillea. But Bougainvillea doesn't have a fragrance. If it doesn't have, l'll go on the previous day and spray some pe_ume. No. l'll do it. Then listen to me. Intoxicated by that smell, l rang the doorbell. No. You rang the doorbell. What is this? A ghost stoy? Let me say.. Let me listen. Let him say.. Now can l say? Yes, son. Jiya opened the door. Come inside. L'll finish my bath 8 come. She opened her shower.. While reading a book.. Opened her shower while reading a book? Dude, pay attention. She opened her shower. You, who were reading a book.. Are not able to do it. In your mind, it is only her.. And the shower. And her taking a shower. And the fragrance ofthe Lux soap that she uses. You want to go in there right now. But no! Sit there! Your militay ethics do not allow you to do that. Like this, you swallow your drivel and sit there itself. And then suddenly, What? Cockroach! Cockroach!! Jiya is screaming out loud like that. When you turned a_er killing that cockroach with one stomp, the sight you saw.. She is standing there looking at you, wet from the shower. Not knowing what to say or do. She even forgot to cover herselfwith her hand. Like a newly married army-man who got his leave, you didn't care about anything else. You began your war right there! It happened. I did it in a weak moment. If only she had cried out aloud... Please forgive me, uncle! So this was your romantic stoy? I can't undentand what his motive is. Even l don't know that. I need Jiya to get her memoy back. How? The doctors tried.. And so did you... There is one way. A doctor friend of mine from Delhi told me.. We have to re-create that accident once again. Without causing any risk to Jiya. We should pick a day when she comes through plantation road alone and do it. The same route she took that day. That's fine bro. But she doesn't know how this accident happened, right? No. She doesn't. But it is somewhere along that route. My plan is that.. When she comes that way, the hairpin bend after the telephone exchange; l will come there in full speed through the hill road. She is coming.. Dear, l am three months pregnant. Press " to get this ringtone from 'Chandanamazha' serial. Got me scared! Bro, she has crossed the 4th hairpin bend. - Okay. - So all the best! 'The brave-hearted will take the bride!' What is this? Oh. It was you? What did you iust do? You don't remember me, right? So, l thought l'll die under some goods lory. Even then, you see whom God sent? You again! You don't know.. Who you are to me.. Once, Raiumon asked me.. Which Raiumon? He is my neighbour's kid.. What is uncle's name.. Park the car properly and flirt around son! Police car. I didn't expect it so soon. You're trapped, man! Things don't happen like we expect them to, right? My God!! What is this? What are you doing, man? The brake failed! Balan, hit him! What did you say you were doing? Accident re-creation. What? Re-creating the same incident again.. Like that.. An item like that.. - What did you do just now? - L hit him, Sir. Re-create it once again! Do you want to re-create things risking a policeman's life? I swear l didn't know you were a policeman, Sir. In spite writing 'POLICE' in bold on thejeep, and in spite of me sitting inside wearing khakis, like Inspector Balram; you didn't know l was a policeman? - Shall l him him, Sir? - No. Then give him one! Enough. - L swear, Sir.. - Here.. I swear, Sir.. Didn't l tell you earlier? It was get that girl's memoy back. You!! You want to get her memoy by chasing her near an abyss? Won't she die? See this.. My hands are still shivering.. - Sir, it's shivering.. - Yes, it is. Not that, Sir. Your phone is shivering. Pick it up. You see what l'll do with you! Sir, it's your wife. Don't pick up. - It must be to talk about that matter. - What matter? She said that she wanted a bathroom 8 toilet attached to the bedroom at home. Since it was a fair request, l said okay. When the wo_ started, she said that she wants a bath-tub. I agreed to that as well. When the bath-tub was almost done, she said.. That she wants a swimming pool. What do i do? Now if l agree to a swimming pool, when it is almost over, what if she says that she didn't mean this, but a small beach instead. What will l do? He escaped. Catch him! Chase! Sir, l'm here only. What is it? Sir, l'll get it ready. What? The beach? You'll bring it in a sack? No. Swimming pool. My friend does it on contract. You don't have to spend a penny! - Really? - Yeah! But you have to help me. What help? A loafer is following this girl l told you about.. You should get him out of my way. Which loafe_ Come.. Sir, this is that loafer. The one you just talked about? - Yes. Are you doing 'Kathakali' with your eyes? No, Sir. L've come here to say the sight l saw with these mo eyes. What sight? Come here, Sir. Sheesh! What is this? Tell me the matter. This guy.. I don't even know who this scoundrel is.. But this guy.. This guy tried to kill you brutally by pushing you into the abyss. l saw it, Sir. I'm here as an eye-witness forthat. Allow me. You should charge the case for murder, Sir. For this, l can even come until the Supreme Court! Apart from that, l humbly request him to be hanged until death, Sir. Tell me Georgekutty, where have you buried the Commissioner's son's body, after coming backfrom the prayer meet in Thodupuzha? - Tell me! - Georgekum? That was another case. I got carried away. A_er silently watching someone tying to kill a policeman, you want to be a witness now? Son, you tell me. What should l do to him? I iust need a byte. Not that byte. I meant a video clip. Video clip? Mine? That's risky. Give it to him. Shut up! Sir, l'll bring what he has to say in that clip. - Okay? - Okay. - Don't forget about the swimming pool. - Done! He will write the script, l will direct.. And you will act.. I came looking for the wealth of a girl who lost her memoy.. I have nothing to do with her. Pranav is her actual lover. I understood how deep Pranav's love for Jiya is.. I am on way to pray at Velankanni shrine for Pranav 8 Jiya to unite. - Say Jai Hind! - Jai Hind! Jai Hind? My script didn't have Jai Hind, right? That must be the policeman's addition. I came here thinking that l'll have to edit something. - But this is ok, right? - It's superb, bro! Let me call Jiya. What happened? Who is in the ICU? Your daddy? - No. - Then? Mummy? - Then? - Come. A dead body in the ICU? I just heard that the police beat him up 8 put him in the hospital. Didn't you getjust one punch, you scoundrel? What is it, Prince? What are you saying? He might be asking us to leave. See. He's saying bye. No. No. Don't take it o_. What ifyou don't get breath? He doesn't get breath when he keeps it. Tell me. What happened, Prince? Why did the Police do this to you? Someone deliberately made the Police hit me, to chase me away from this town. God! Will it be daddy? No, no! Not your daddy! If itwas him, he would've sent the army. Will it be Ravi then? No. He doesn't have the brains to do this. Jiya, - Pranav! Pranav! - Huh? L've deleted it. Pranav, what did you delete? An office file. I sent it to America. Butjust before it reached Australia, l deleted it from Singapore. - You've deleted it? - Yes, yes. What is it, Prince? Why did you say his name? Since Pranav has deleted it from Singpaore, do you doubt someone, Prana_ No. J Still yOU taMe aS SOOn aS yOU heard this, right? You always used to say, 'When you're in trouble, l will be there'. - Did you arrange this? - Yes. Please come. This is the latest victim of police brutality against the common man. Jiya, let's go. They'll do the needful now. Are you able to talk, brother? Tell me, tell me what happened? L... My name is Prince. - Isn't this that 'Kathakali' guy? - Yes, Sir. The Sl 8 policemen beat me to pulp, broke my bones, - We just have gave him one punch, right? - That's it, Sir. He would've been trapped in a lathi charge. Under Dr.Suresh's recommendation, l was given the Combiflam injection. On my butt. Around 2 hours back. A_erthat, l don't remember anything. The Prime Minister is still maintaing silence, overthe incident where a poor young man was brutally beaten up. The Commissioner is joining us live now. Sir, an Sl from your department has done this brutal act. Which rascal is that? Bloody fool! We made an enquiy. And immediately suspended the o_icer as part ofthe enquiy. That is Kerala Police! That's how Police should be! Hey, call the commissioner. Let me compliment him for this brave decision. Call him. Sir, they're showing the photo ofthat policeman. No, no! l don't want to see that rascal's face. You call the commissioner. - The commissioner is calling you. - That's it! When we thought about him, he called! What the hell have you done? Suspension? - For me? - Yes. Why? You'll know that when you get the suspension order. You have to report to the Commissioner's o_ice within 3 PM today. - Understood? - Okay Sir. Sir, it's your wife. Ask her to get used to bathing in a canal. Madam, he said you can bathe in a canal from now on. You rascal Pranav! I can wearthis hat just for an hour more. Before that, l have to do one more thing. Come. - Even he's punctured! - You! What happened, Pranav? Did the police beat you up? You dog, Jiya gave those fruits for me. Those local bananas are yours. You eat that! Bananas are good for motion during the morning. You can have them. What happened here? Hey.. You are clever. But let me tell you something. Whether it is foryou or for me, what we both need is Jiya to get her memoy back. So at least for that, can we think about it together? You want Jiya to get her memoy back. And l should support you for that. - Exactly! I won't do that! Because, l don't want Jiya to get her memoy back. I don't want herto get her memoy back at all! It's a problem ifJiya gets her memoy back or even if she doesn't. If she gets her memoy back, she will go with them. And if she doesn't get it back, she doesn't even know you, right? Find a way to chase those guys away! There's one way. The accident which caused Jiya's memoy loss. That wasn't an accident. One of them, or maybe the both ofthem together, did it deliberately! - Is it? - Huh? What do l do with him? My dearfriend, we will say this to Jiya! But she has to believe it, right? Even if she doesn't, she will have a doubt. That's enough. What happened to you, was not just an ordinay accident. The Police doesn't have such a doubt. Police! Jiya, have they been able to find the car you drove during the accident yet? Then what's the point? Call them both, and present this matter to them yourself. We will know instantly, if they are responsible for it or not. Call them both! I had to attend a reception. That's why l'm late. Eveyone here is speaking so_ly. So keep it low. She asked you to speak softly and not to show signs like dumb people. Stop it, you idiot! The accident which happened to me... lt was notiust an accident. The people who are responsible for it, are around this table itself. Here, here.. This table.. I meant they are around this table. - Got it? - Mathews! Was it Mathews? You bloody detective! It wasn't me! Ravi? - Ravi, it was you? - Huh? Mathews, Ravi? So it was Mathews 8 Ravi togethe_ Both of them togethe_ My God! Shall l hand them over to police right now? Shall l finish them right now? Please shut up, brother. That wasn't what l meant to say.. The person who tried to kill you.. This Ravi and. When did l ty to kill her? Let me complete what l'm saying, you donkey! Jiya, Mathews is going to say it. Pay attention. Tell us, Mathews. Don't wory about Ravi. I'm there, right? Come on! Say it! Watch out! Ravi, whos wedding has been fixed with Jiya.. When he realised it isn't going to happen, Say it, say it Mathews.. One among you.. He, ioined him and tried to kill Jiya! Right Mathews? Say it! Yes. Why should l ioin him? - L didn't mean that you joined him.. - Then? That's it, Mathews.. Tell me.. Ravi didn'tioin me.. but him, right? I was the one whom Ravi 8 him were against, right? Why should l ty to kill poor Jiya? If it's proved that you are behind this, l'll be the one who's gonna kill you. Why should l ty to kill Jiya? I'm ready to even die for her. - Then die.. Stab yourself.. - L will do that! Stab yourself. l'll help you! Lfyou act smart, l'll stab both ofyou! - Then stab me! - L will! - As if l'm going to letyou do it! - L don't need your permission. - You look like a total fraud. - You're a biggerfraud! Then prove it! - What's there to prove? Your face is proof! - Ask Jiya who l am! - Things have gone out control. I'm just a goon from the streets! Me too! You're not a goon, you're a loony! Shut up, oryou'll get trapped. - Then come on, stab me! - Stop it! Even if it was an accident or not, these troubles will be over if l die, right? Hey, Jiya.. Are you happy now? Jiya, let me talkto you.. Jiya, don't listen to him. He's a fraud. Listen to me alone. One minute. 'District Jail, Ernakulam' How is my sister Valli? She's fine, brother! One minute. Hold this. It's my friend.. Ravi.. Ya.. l had called.. I'm at the iail now.. Not inside.. Outside.. Our Valli's brother has been released. I came here to receive him. I called you to say that.. We willl tell Maari annan eveything in detail.. He will handle those mo bloody 'P's.. Eveything is okay. You come home. - Mathews isn't here. - L know. He asked me to wait here. Okay. You come inside. L'll have a bath 8 come. Cockroach!! - Where is Valli? - She must be thrilled now. Is it? Brother! What happened, dear? She must be cying out of joy, seeing her brother. Don't cy, dear.. Tell me what happened.. Don't cy, dear.. L've come a_er so Iong to see you.. What is the point ifyou keep cying like this? Tell me dear.. My God!! You devil! Forgive me, bro! Itiust happened... ln a weak moment, me and Valli.. Brother, he's the one who did this to me.. If she had cried out aloud then, lt's okay.. A chance foryou to cy out Ioud will come right now. I don't know what to tell you. Don't you say that, only God can change the promise that you made? This must be God's decision. How did l have a son like him? What do we do now? - What to do? He's not listening to anything. He's a political goon. I must get them married this Friday at the Mariyamman Temple. There's no other option. Sory dear.. I know you already have many problems... And now this too.. Dear, Like l told him, this is God's will. God must have thought that you shouldn't be living with a perverted rascal like him, and erased him from your memoy. Daddy! You shut up! I have to find that Mathews! He's the one who made you do all this! Isn't it better to go slow? What if you get scared otherwise? Hey.. She is taking you along to say that she doesn't like you. Don't be depressed when you hear that. She's taking you to the suicide point 8 kill you. Don't scream then. Both ofyou, please get down. Major Ravi, who was chasing me around has gone! To mary another girl. Yes. l heard that. A Tamil girl, right? What is your plan now? Well.. l.. I can guess why you guys cooked up stories to get close to me. A fairly good-looking girl.. Single child.. Loads of cash.. resort and what not.. And no memoy as well! What more is needed.. For mo international frauds? But things are not like what you imagined. I didn't get you. Nothing has happened to me after the accident! What? I haven't lost my memoy! You haven't lost your memoy? Then why did you do all this? Doctor, Actually, l am acting. There's nothing wrong with me. This is my only way out. Or else l'll have to mary that donkey! Since he rescued my daddy, my wedding has been fixed with his son. You haven't seen him, right? A complete idiot. There's an actual 'P' in my life. And you both know that it's not you. I never knew that, l would have to suffer mo such nuisances, because of a drama l played to ditch Ravi. I was tolerating it because l was helpless. All your stupid shenanigans, all these days. Now that Ravi is out of my life, l can't tolerate you guys for a second further. Now l can tell daddy, that l don't know these mo frauds. Daddy will handle the rest. You might be a big businessman.. That's better.. Jiya, don't listen to him. Listen to me. Don't you understand what l said? How many times l told this.. And still you're stooping so low.. There's a limit! Okay. l'm going! By the way, you remember eveything, right? You haven't seen me anywhere, right? Didn't l say no? So you don't have anything to ask me, right? Don't come later asking for compensations. That's why l asked. Think once more! I'm going anyway! You loser, didn't you hear her? Can't you get lost? If she gets married to him, her life will be over! He is really sad. Even though, we were fighting all the time, l can understand his feelings. What you said was like a tight slap to him. But he knows only to react like this. And how are you going to react? You'll come home drunk 8 create a nuisance there? Then? Will you morph my photos, circulate them and shame me? So you'll be all emotional and cut your veins, and write a love letter with your blood? I will kill you. Who did you think l was? Nice name, right? I tookthat name for you. It should have been a 'P', right? So, P for Pranav. He must be sad about you getting your memoy back. But l'm happy! I did all that drama, for this moment! For you to get your memoy back! And to tell me that.. Now tell me.. Where is my car? Ca_ Which car? That day, at the co_ee shop, 'Please.. One small spin'. The carthat you took from me, saying that! L've smuggled many things. From gold biscuits to eveything needed for a house! Similarly, l smuggled this carfrom Dubai via Tuticorn port taking a huge risk! That red car outside? You know Jiya Holidays at the hill-top? That's ours.. Just one round. I came a_er you in this disguise, to find out where my car was! I don't remember. You don't remember? Didn't you just say sometime back, that you were acting like you lost memoy? That's true.. But.. I must get my car! Bro, check out that car! Look at how she's going! There she goes! You and your bloody premonition! Who is this? Is she dead, bro? Bro, what do l do with this car? Take it to our garage. Does she have memoy or not? She has.. But she doesnt.. I didn't get you. That is, she was acting as if she lost her memoy. So she has memoy, right? That's where the problem lies. She has actually lost her memoy. You dog, why would someone who actually lost her memoy, act like she has lost her memoy? Who do l think l am to believe this? - This idiot? - Yes. - How do l explain? - Ty.. Let me ty explaining. So the thing is, while she was acting like she lost her memoy, she had actually lost her memoy. She didn't know that! Because she didn't have memoy, right? So, since she is acting like she lost her memoy, she didn't thinkthat she would've actually lost it! There's a slight confusion, right? For me too. Err.. l.. Let me ty once again! That is.. Lfyou both are tying to fool me together, you son of a swine! What is it, boss? Not you, you bloody pork! Don't thinkyou've become an underworld don, a_er smuggling a couple of gold chains 8 stuff! So don't ty to show o_ in front of us! It's an old car, right? Will the problem be over if l arrange another new car? You can take that car and shove it in your mouth! Do you know? It was the car my son drove before he died. It is his memorial. His favourite! The first 8 the last! - Biju? - Yes boss! Just remind him who we are! Or else, he would forget even that! Is that necessay? That this will lead to some other problem. It's easy to say. No memoy, memoy is gone; memoy has come back! And now what? I remember the accident happening. I remember coming to the hospital as well. But the rest.. That is how our brain wo_s, Jiya. It is not in our control. What you were acting out, actually happened to you! Due to the shock ofthe accident, certain things that happened then.. Like how you took Pranav's car; and that the same car was in the accident, has blurred out from your memoy. Before the accident happened, l saw Pranav.. And a_er the accident, l saw Prince. That's why their images are haunting you. Apart from vague memories, l don't remembertaking the car, and whatever happened a_er that! I swear on God! So you don't have anything to ask me, right? Later, don't come asking for compensations! That's why l'm asking. You understood the area, Samee_ - Yes, Sir. You should be there. - Yes, Sir. Don't say that, Chettiyaar! First you come 8 see the car! Then tell me a price. Ya. l'll be here only. - Okay. - Bro, Will the police come a_er us? Don't start offwith your black tongue again! Since she doesn't remember us, we don't have to wory. She was a nice girl! If it had worked out, l could've lived like a king! Such high hopes you had! Changing your name, acting as her old lover, tattooing her name.. Lfyou had tried to sell this instead of going behind her, we could've repaired our loans! Shut up! I'm going to sell it. Chettiyaar is on his way. That's good. L'll also get back the Rs.1500 which you owe me. Did she really say that she didn't like you? Ya. She said that. - Good. - At least her life is saved. Get lost! You come inside! L'll serve you right! This is why dad got married again! - Oh my God! - The car! - Son! I'm taking this. Thank you for storing it safely. What are you looking at, you ass? Chase him! - Bro, our car! - My God! - My 1500 bucks. He's tying to fool my boss! Lfyou keep accelerating, petrol won't get filled by itself. Why didn't you pour some petrol in this then? What kind of a car mechanic are you? Have you seen any car mechanic who fills petrol in cars that come to the garage? Move! Hey boy, go get some petrol. Here! Bring the petrol we have in the garage. You may leave! When he brings petrol, l'll leave with the car. Where? L've paid for petrol, right? L'll take the car. Is it so in yourtown? Lfyou buy petrol, you can take the ca_ lf it's my own car, l can take it. This is my car. That cray witch, took it from asking for a small spin; and ended up in an accident. By the way, you're even smarter, huh? When you saw a good looking girl 8 a car together, you tried to steal them both? I won't get the girl anyway! But l want this car. You won't get it. - Then you gon't get it too. L've sold this to Chinnappa Chettiyaar. You sold it? Now ifyou want it, buy it from him. How dare you sell my car without my permission? Why should l go ask random people for my ca_ Don't touch me! Don't fool around with me. Have you heard ofthe underworld? - Underwear? Underworld! I risked my life to smuggle this car. I will take it. So it's not yours? Then let me see how you're gonna take it! Even these guys have started asking what's inside the car. More than what's inside the car, they shouldn't know what the car is! It's gold. Completely. From the engine to the wheel base, eveything is made of gold. You didn't know that? What were you smuggling then? What kind of a smuggler are you? Dog! What? Not you. l was thinking of another dog. The dog who made me bring this. His son's sentiments.. Nonsense.. My God! Was l going to sell this fortune to Chettiyar for 1 .5 lakhs? Anyway, good that you didn't fill petrol in this. Hey smuggler, we're not going to get that girl anyway. Should we lose this gold too? What? I went around acting that l loved her, to settle down in life. And there are a lot of loans on my family as well. Lfthis is the case, you won't have to work for someone else. What say? The 4 wheels 8 spare wheel foryou! I iust need the rest! You 8 your mean ways! I was the one who smuggled this taking all the risk! I was the one who stored this car 8 gave you this idea! So? - So l'm not saying 50-50. But give me half of what you get. Bro! Here. I have to tell you something important. It's really urgent. - Tell me later. Go man! Why are you looking back? Go! Smart guy! If he knows this, he'll sell us also along with this. Best. Pour it fast! Gosh! Jose! Dude! Get into the car when l tell you. Get in the car! Get in! Quick! My car. Come to me. Come to daddy! Got it, right? Boss, he wasn't saying Hi. He was saying bye. Idiots! Get in! Who are these people? - Jose! - You want juice in bemeen all this? Notiuice. Jose. He was the one whom l smuggled this car for. Don't give him anything! Go fast! Don't hit the gold car. Chase carefully. You put the le_ indicator 8 turned right? Who taught you driving?

I mean be careful 8 go fast! The indicator again! Yes boss! Right indicator, and ya, he's turned left. He's tying to fool me like the tigerwas fooled in that folk stoy. Careful! Careful! The carwill flip! Drive carefully man! Before we catch them, don't get me killed! Stop the car! I said stop the car! There! You asked me to stop 8 l've stopped. Not to you! I was asking them to stop the car. Start the car! Stop! Stop! Stop, man! You want to pee, boss? Which side was their indicator towards before turning? Towards right! Isn't it? Yes! - The go le_! We're going through the foothills. I think they will escape towards the town. Where will you go now? To the water? Drive! Let me see! Stop! Come! I said stop the car. There's no road or bridge there! It's gone! You were going on asking me to go southwards, right? If we had gone that way, we'd have been trapped. That's what l also meant! Hello Mister, l have a sixth sense in this matter. Even if l close my eyes 8 drive, l'll land only at a safe place. Who are they? The safest place to bring a gold car into. The customs department's ship! The award for the best smuggler this year is definitely foryou! Sir, l thinkthis is the same car. They've understood. We've trapped. You are trapped. This is your car. I just asked for a lift. I don't know anything. At least now, stand by me, you dog! Are you sure? You'll stand by me too? Who are you? Sir, don't do anything to me. I don't know anything. This is his.. No, Sir. This is not his car. Is it your car? No, no. It's our... lt belongs to you both? No. Someone brought it to our garage to get it repaired. Yes. That's true. Someone brought it to our garage 8 said that it's his son's memorial; and he wanted us to repair it quickly. That's all we know. When we saw this scratch on this bumper, we had a doubt. So when they knew that we had this doubt they threatened us, Sir. - And they tried to kill us, Sir. But we decided together that we will never bow our heads, in front of antisocials who destroy the economic balance of our county.. Yes, Sir. So we escaped without bowing our heads. Escaped? He meant that we escaped with this to come here. Why didn't you inform this to the police? He will say that correctly, Sir. It won't be right ifwe inform the Police, Sir. We've read about smuggled goods in the papers, right? So.. And we can trust the Customs blindly, right? During my childhood, l wanted to be a Customs o_icer when l grew up. Then mom asked me to get a real job. Good iob, boys! According to the Customs department's rules, you'll get a percentage ofthe worth ofthe smuggled item. That wasn't needed. Can you take us both into the Customs department? Stand up! You don't have to hold me. L'll come. Leave my throat! The money which was made by cheating the poor working class. The attempt to smuggle it; This court sentences 4 years imprisonment to the accused 8 his accomplices. This court is handing over the responsibility to assess the worth of smuggled goods 8 return the money to people who've lost it to the Customs, Police and Revenue department officen. Don't stare. It's the same amount for both of us. I doubt if you have an extra O. Yea. l have an extra O. You want it? I don't want your O. What? See that. Abdullah, - Yes, sir. Put me in Govindachamy's cell. The food there is good. I have to be glamourous. L'll ty my best, Sir. Move the cheque.. - l have to go to the bank for that. I said, hide the cheque! God will punish you! What is this? I was seeing if it will bounce! - Let it be! I hope it bounces! For helping us to nab Jose. For me? What for? I was just saying thanks because you thanked me. How many thanks will he say in one day? Why did he say thanks to us for nabbing Jose? That's what.. - l'm behind that. I told them that you're my friends; and that you did all this to bring back my memoy. Apart from that, l promised that you didn't have anything to do with this car business. Intentionally or not, you both solved a huge crisis in my life. And, for entertaining me with a lot of stories; a return gi_ from me. Nothing happened to you and you got the money as well. Now we are even. There is nothing that we owe each other. By the way, can we meet your 'P'? Jiya's PA? Not Jiya's PA. P. The real P. Has he come? Then introduce us. That's not needed. What ifyou start making new stories then? I know both ofyou vey well. Leave us alone. Let us live in peace. And ifyou both have real names and addresses, l'll send my wedding invites. Okay then. See you. That original P is really lucky! I have iust one prayer. That they both should get divorced as soon as possible. Are you so cheap? - Why? I can't wish forthat! - Is this what you wish for? Who among you knows more details about smuggling? What happened, Sir? Customs preventive officer, Tresyamma Madam is calling you. She wants to know some more details. He's the best guy! Dude, you go see her and get things cleared. Aren't you the real smuggler? You go! You're pemect for her! I was the one who called you. Why are you reluctant to come? What reluctance? I did eveything. I mean all those things. He's a little kid, madam. I'm the one who knows eveything. Just me. Whoever it is, come.. God, l hope at least this wo_s out. What do you know about this? Sometime back, you didn't know anything, right? Leave at least this one for me. - That's what l also want to say. Punnoose Varghese. We're from the same Church. Shut up! Madam, is your husband Punnoose Varghese in the Customs? Punnoose is my Daddy. English. Won't work out for you! L'll teach her Malayalam! Yes. l saw him.
