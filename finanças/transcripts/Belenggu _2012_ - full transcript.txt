Ty to remember Remember? You're both wrong. They're still alive. Oh thank goodness. You found him. And then he run away That's very shocking to us. We hadn't expected it. Did he ever try to run away before? Never Would you consider him as a dangerous patient? Most of the time he like to keep to himself. He is also very polite. I don't know what got into him. But, please. But please. Return Jingga to me. Please. When he lived here... I had never seem him with anyone. Not even once? Not to my knowledge. Okay Sir. Can you remember... Maybe he had brought home a woman once? Someone named Jingga? No... nothing Elang doesn't like to make friends... he always keeps things to himself. But... What? But... He's a little strange. I always think that about him. How do you mean? One night we had a blackout. I don't know why... I had a feeling I wanted to check the place out. And on the top floor... which was unused and empty. I saw him standing and quivering... while looking up. But there was nothing above him. And then what else? I often saw him stand alone in the hallway. He was silent for a very long time. Sometimes it was as if he was talking to someone. Would you like some sweets? He didn't even realize that... I was watching him. Oh yes... There was another strange thing that happened one night. He was talking about seeing blood on the floor. and asked about his next door neighbour. but the floor was clean and there was nothing going on, What's with the next door neighbour? That's what was strange about it. The room next door has been been vacant for a year now. Two months ago... I saw a young man lying on the floor, in front of the door. He was very weak. So I brought him in... and gave him something to drink. He didn't say much. It seemed like he didn't know where he was. I felt bad for him. So I offered him a job here. How did you find him? I mean, how did he behave? He's very quiet. But he works hard. It's just that sometimes. he lives in his own world. Was that why you fired him? On one strange evening. We had a customer who kept arguing with her boyfriend. Where's the proof that you had broken things off? I know your game. You think you can play tricks on me? You asshole! Hey, watch you mouth! You think... you're holier than everyone else? You asshole! You're so cheap. You mean the silent young man? Yes, he comes here... often to drink coffee by himself. And he always sits in that corner over there. This your coffee. How are you today? I don't really know him. He never likes to talk. Except maybe to one of my waitresses. Ningsih I don't really know much about him. He doesn't speak very often. But he loves to talk about hiss bunny dreams. I don't know. He seems to hate bunnies. Bunnies. And you didn't feel weirded out by it? Of course, I did. I things bunnies are the cutest thing. One more thing. Have you ever seen him talk to a women named Jingga? He always comes here alone. What's your connection with the men you slaughtered? What's your connection with three men you slaughtered? I didn't know them. You didn't know them? Here's an ax... and here's you bloodied shirt which you dumped into the trash. Answer me I really don’t know them. I really didn't know them. They why did you kill them? To revenge Jingga Jingga, Jingga, Jingga. You're driving me nuts. Arturo, stop it. Arturo, stop it. Sit down. Sit down. I'm not lying to you, Sir. Please believe me. All right. Why don't you tell us about Jingga. All right. Those three men had raped Jingga. I simply carried out her revenge. I love Jingga. I will do anything for her, Please Believe me. He can't tell the difference... Between what's real and what's not. He built... His own world inside his head... until he believed that... His imagination was real. So he could manipulate everything to look crazy, Right? Are you questioning my diagnosis? I've tested him. I've hundreds of patients like him. Doctor. Doctor So that means... If he did commit murder... he wouldn't be conscious of it? Right? That's right Yeah. In other words, he'll get away with it. In other words... He doesn't belong in jail. I don't buy that bullshit We're not going to let him get away with it, are we? I remember on the night it happened. The sky looked darker than usual. That's my daughter's photograph. That's my daughter photograph. Her name's Laras. She died ten years ago. In an accident. She was 15 years old Can you tell us... About the three men who were murdered? How well did you know them? They're drunkards... with nothing better... To do than make problems. Please have a drink. Thank you. One more thing... have you ever heard... involving the three murdered people? So it's true... those three men had raped a woman? That's an old story... which we all tried to cover for. Everyone... pretends like nothing had ever happened. Can you talk to us about it? Once there was a young woman... who used to rent one of the small houses here. She was a prostitute. She always kept things to herself. She only left her house at night. Everyone here talked about her. as if we all much better than she was. You know about it? This is a small area. Everyone here knows about it. And then what happened? Well, word got around... and everybody turned into a pariah. Everybody cornered her. Shamed her. What about the woman? She died. She hanged herself. When did it happen? Around two years ago. Two years? Was her name Jingga? Jingga? No one ever knew her real name. Everyone here called her... a witch. We should focus on Elang and forget about Jingga. The bloodied knife and shirt... are enough to prove he had done it. But how would he have know about the rape? And what did have to do with the three men? Fortunately, there hasn't been too many suicide cases... in the last three years, Which makes it easier for us to compile the data. especially for those who cannot be identified. I remember what happened. The woman was very beautiful. It was unfortunate that she felt she had to kill herself. Is this name of the woman who committed suicide? Yes. It is. How did you know about the rape? Jingga told me. Jingga doesn’t exist. And you were treated at the hospital... the woman who was raped had hanged herself and died. Come on You must have read about it in the paper... and made up something for yourself. Right? Jingga is still alive. You're smarten than everyone thinks you are. You're trying to manipulate them... with your stories... so they'll think you're crazy. Do you still remember that? What is this? Do you remember? Look at it. These are pictures of you wife and daughter... you killed them five years ago. You never admitted Ti killing them. You said there an evil bunny... who come to the house and killed them. Yes, the bunny did it. Now find him. That evil man was you, Elang. No... It was you. It was you... It was not. But you wouldn't admit to it... you always said someone else had done it. It wasn't me... Do remember... Look at all the faces! Look The day was Senja's birthday. You came home earlier after working the performance... because you wanted to surprise her. You're home early. Senja. Daddy brought you a gift. Where are going sweetie? Please understand. We've talked about this. I can't take it any more. Please. Please understand me. I'm scared, Mother. You don't have to be scared. Everything's okay. Where are you going? Senja, wait over there. I can't take it any more. I'm leaving. I will never let you or my child leave this house. Never How long will you keep me here for? Until the day you die. Dad... don't Djenar... Senja Where are you guys? Quickly, he'll be home soon. So did you do to them? That's impossible... Open your eyes, Elang. That's impossible... You remember. That's impossible... I couldn’t have killed the people I love. There was no one else there, just you. Look at them Look at those faces closely Look at them You are the killer. Now you know... There was no one else but you. There was only you. Hallo Haris? Is Yosef there? All right... please tell him... That I am bringing him a very important document for him. Yes, very important. Okay. Please wait for me. Please forgive me. Forgive me, sweetie... I;am sorry for your loss. Thank you. Yes, Haris. What is it? From the report we received... Arturo's death is not an accident. What about the document he had with him? I haven't received it. We didn't find any document on location. So the woman did not die? No, she didn't. The old woman who brought her here saved her... When she tried to hang herself. An old woman? Yes Jingga Jingga Where are you? Jingga Let me go... let me go... Jingga... Jingga Where is Jingga? Let me go... let me go... Let me go... Relax Elang. I'm here. How are you?
