What utter darkness suddenly surrounds me? You got up early again? Yet you know that Mother goes to bed very late. - When were you put to bed? - I dunno. Dad's waking up now. What is it? What's the matter? Don't you feel well? Calm down... Calm down! Mummy... l'm scared! Mummy l'm hurt! L have to go to the hospital. Michel is bleeding l'll drive you there. Charles isn't well either. He attacked us! You drive them. L'm going to the Police. L'll call the office to say l'll be late. THE BREACH Mrs. Regnier, we're not doing it for fun. You hit him in self-defense? No, to protect Michel. He threw him across the room. Is the child seriously wounded? L don't know. L'm waiting. Did you quarrel often with your husband? You had difficulties? No no... What is your husband's job? He writes. Wants to become an author. He has no real position, then. Yes, he has. You work outside? You're a barmaid at the "Friends' Bar". Many wives work so their husbands can study. You work nights? L want to bring up my son myself. Your son has a broken leg and a cranial traumatism. Be at rest, it's not bad. He has a nice bed. You can see him soon. Here take this. You'll feel better. We'll soon be through. How's Charles? He'll be ok. Where is he? His father took him back home. Yes, l understand. Isn't he Ludovic Regnier the manufacturer? Your father-in-law is very rich. L don't want him to take Michel. L'm unable to work in an office. You know why your husband attacked you? For the child, it was an accident. Are you lodging a complaint? L can't let him come near Michel. He was like mad. L don't know he's become mad. If your statement is proven, you've a right... l know... my rights. L'll get a divorce, but please leave me alone now because... Forgive us. If you like, l'll drive you back. How kind of you to have waited, Mrs. Roy! But l prefer to stay until Michel wakes up and explains what happened. L can't thank you enough for what you did. It's only natural. Can you tell me of a lawyer for my divorce? What? You want to... Don't come to a decision in a hurry. It's too serious. And you're upset. Give me the address of a lawyer. There's the one who pleaded for my husband. L'm his second wife, you see. If you wish to see your son... l saw the Doctor about Michel. L'll have him put into a separate room. He needs people around him. He'll have the nurses required. He's better among other children. L'll pay. L'll look after him. L'll manage. He's my son! He's the son of Charles. And this marriage is finished! As soon as l've seen a lawyer. Listen, l advise you to... Charles will never again mistreat us! That's a lie! Who hit Charles? Who hurt him? It was me. A foolish marriage! If you want to know, Charles is with us. L know. Well taken care of. He'll never go back to your place. He won't pay the rent any longer. Our lawyers will divide the property. Half of the house, the car the furniture. Anything you want. If a financial arrangement... l want what's legally mine! And l'll get it. We'll take care of Michel. No you won't! What do you think? L've always supported my husband and son. L paid everything... ...including the rent. That's what you wanted right? Will you continue to be a barmaid... ...or a taxi-girl... ...or will you go back to strip-teasing? L'm too old to work as a dancing-girl. That's no life for a small child. As soon as he's well, we'll go to Paris. You've no right to take him away. You destroyed my son, don't destroy his son! L shouldn't have laughed. Are you Miss Lagache? Do you know a place around here... where l could find a room? Not too expensive? Well... l wouldn't know. L can't go home, my son is up there. Yes, l understand. And l'm so tired... What's the matter? She'd like to find a room around here. She's worn out, poor girl. Not too expensive. Don't worry, l know of something. The dope was too strong this morning. You feel the effect of it. What about a small boarding-house? Mrs. Pinelli will surely have a room. - Where is it? - Across the street. Since l live there, you know it's not too expensive. Lean against me, let's go. You're Mrs. Regnier? L'm Doctor Blanchard. Left foot. Right foot. Try to straighten up! It's a decent house. Men and women apart. Everyone in their quarters. Feeling better? Let's go. Three old women play cards all the time in this house. They're funny. Don't worry about your son, he'll be alright. It's here. - You feel better? - Yes We'll speak to Mrs. Pinelli. Let's hope there's a room available. Elise, be a good girl, call mom. She's a bit abnormal, but sweet. Here's a lady who'd like to rent a room. Hello madame, l'm Mrs. Regnier. My small boy is at the hospital. And l'd like to stay as near as possible. Please excuse me. You're a friend of Dr. Blanchard's? Sorry? Are you a friend of the doctor's? No, not at all. He was kind enough to take me here. This way... The only room left. It used to be a veranda. The air is good. That's all l have. But it's very pleasant. Yes, it's fine. But isn't it too... How much is it? 10,000 per week. Including the breakfast. No dinners, no suppers. There's a bathroom. How long would you keep it? It'll depend on my son's health. Until l can take him away. L'll pay one week in advance. Later, l'll go and get my things. He was admitted this morning. L'd like to rest a little. This is a single room. Men aren't allowed to stay downstairs. And ladies mustn't go upstairs. This is a decent place. There's a bolt inside, but no key. Everyone is honest here. But l'm not responsible for valuables. Don't you worry. It'll be fine. It's alright. It'll be fine. And the husband? L can't tell you more than l know. L bet we'll see more of Dr. Blanchard! She won't stay long. We'll soon see the hubby or the boy-friend or both! An ambulance! L just rented the veranda. That's very good. L accept anyone as long as we can. What will become of us later, Henri? Don't worry. They won't pull it down before September. That young woman looks all right. How old is the boy? He's four. Normally, he'll be given to the mother. Oh my god! There's nothing normal in this matter. L want to know this: Legally, what constitutes indignity? The mother's indignity? Difficult. It has to be proved without a doubt. How? If she's insane not just a little... but completely insane. If she's a criminal, l mean... if she murdered somebody. If she is a confirmed drunkard. Or if she has an incurable disease. What about immorality? Morality? It would require a lot of evidence. And vulgarity? The lack of education? The incapability of raising the child in comfort? It's up to your son to provide that comfort. So... you want this divorce... you don't want this woman to raise the child. Is your son aware of this? Of course. Why isn't he here with us? He is sick. He's wounded. "She" wounded him. They had a fight. Since their marriage, she's tried to destroy him. The child was wounded in the fight. What if l brought evidence? Of what? Of the truth. That woman won't ruin my son's life... ...and then go peacefully with the child! The poor kid is already neurotic. Let them come to an agreement. L don't want him to see her. My son was wounded. Everything they owned must go to him. That's impossible. Listen to me... As soon as everything is legally settled... ...my wife and l will take care of the child. No lengthy proceedings, none of that. If proof is needed, l'll find some! Aren't you wasting money, Mr. Regnier, ...sending against her anyone at all? Goodbye my lady. Do what is necessary, please. A too obvious hostility would be unwise. ...and the judge will side with the mother. It's clear you've never accepted this marriage. Control yourselves. And, believe me, there's often... ...a prejudice against money. Thanks for your advice. Old fossil! L'm going to see Charles. Come with me, don't leave me alone! - She won't win, will she? - Oh no! L guarantee she won't! And you haven't seen him since? Well, let's settle the most urgent. L'll go with you to the flat... so that you take your things legally. L saved 400 francs. May l take them? Your own savings? Take them, by all means! Mrs. Roy can't have told you about your fee... l don't know when l can pay it. There's no hurry. Don't worry about that. Let's go. I... have no car for the moment. We'll take the tram. They've always hated me. L'm not educated. When Mother died, my father fell ill. L had to leave school. We lived Fontainebleau. L had a girlfriend in Paris. L was tempted. L worked in several shops, then an office. Then l attended dancing classes. L spent everything l had. Then l was engaged as a strip-teaser... A strip-teaser? That didn't last long, it was too hard. You don't realize. It's not fun. L met Charles. Three months later, we married. Funny, he never talked about his folks. Never said they were wealthy. As if he were ashamed. Ashamed? Well... why be ashamed of wealth? L don't know. Towards himself... because they supported him. But it didn't last long. They went crazy when they heard he'd married. They came to see us. We were living near the Seine. Charles had rented a typewriter. We tried to sell stories. While l was working. We didn't find it awful. But they did! Our armchair was a bit torn. His mother looked at it expecting rats to come out. L mended it. Later, they heard l'd been a dancer. And they didn't like it? They wanted us to divorce. That went on 3 years. We had little money, but we were happy. You were in love. Well sure... And l was pregnant. Charles was happy. He had found a job. Then he fell ill. He said it was stress... l don't know. His pals told him it was stupid to have kids. So he wrote his parents. Nothing else to do. He was ill and couldn't work. And l was about to deliver. They wrote back ambiguous letters... ...then sent the tickets. That's how we came here. We lived with them in the big house. Three doctors took care of Charles. And l was there, with my big belly. They kept saying they were happy, but... When Michel was born, they took care of him. He had a nurse who knew how to feed him... how to bathe and dress him. They tried hard to be nice, but couldn't. When l wanted to take Michel, they said: "Be careful!" It was true, he cried. You'll say l had it easy and l could have cared more. No, l don't think it's your style. Then l realized all wasn't well for Charles. He didn't work. He was gone all day and returned with strange eyes. Is that when he started taking drugs? He said he had problems. But l told myself l should go because l felt l had fallen into a frightful trap. One day, l took Michel in my arms and left. And Charles ran after me, came with me... and stayed. Because... he loved me. You sure are courageous. L didn't have the strength to choose otherwise. We thought things would settle down. It worsened... without my realizing it Well, l didn't want to face it. His parents had talked so badly of me. Yet he continued to see them. He became more and more addicted. L'm sure that's what made him crazy because he's usually nice. He's not a brute at all. He loved Michel, he never would've... hurt him. L think there's no chance he'll get custody of the kid. They have so much money! Mr. Thomas is here. Let them in. My dear Paul! So glad to see you again. So am I, Sir. Please sit down. L'll explain why l asked you to come. My dear Paul, l was sorry to hear... ...your dealing was not very prosperous. Well, l have small problems. That's what l meant. It saddens me... ...because l liked your father a lot. And you as well. Don't exaggerate! Listen... He and l were unlucky in that business. L'd have given a lot for him to end... otherwise. ...in short, though l feel no guilt, l'd like to honor his memory ...by doing something for his son. You interest me l must say. L know l do. You're utterly broke. L inquired about you. L don't doubt it. L'd like you to do something for me. By way of compensation, if all goes well... Would you come back into the business? Come back? How? As a manager. L'm tempted! What must l do, kill someone? Ok! Specially if he's a skunk. L'm only looking for evidence against a person... Just one proof? Is that all? L won't have to plant anything? Certainly not. Not even... fabricate some coincidences? Are you living alone, Paul? Yup! Hardened sinner bachelor! L just want to know... Come on, tell me what you want. L want my grandson. There's a detail l'd like to settle. Suppose l search hard and find nothing? L'll have wasted my time! There is something. All l want is to find it. In order to convince the judge... ...and take the child back. That's what l want. L'd do anything for what you promise me. That's fine. Of course, l'll do my best to help you. What about expenses? There will be charges... Yes, l expect there will be. L'll give you a list of their friends. Have you ever met her? L just saw her once at a party. Come, l'll show you what she did to my son. "The Knight kissed the young Queen's hand" "Then he fell at her feet". Hello old chum! Pleasure to see you, Paul! Mother was reading to me. He can't read very well yet. And l love to read aloud. You got a funny shoulder! It's nothing. It's still aching. He can't move without help. But here... he's being cared for extremely well... ...that l'm sure of! Sonia, for God's sake! Stop for a minute! Old Regnier wanted to give me some dough. Are you crazy? Look at that! He's the crazy one! He's offered me a management. You told me he was swine. The lousiest of all swine! He asked me to find proofs against a bitch. What for? To take her kid. He's the old man's grandson. - But if there are no proofs? - There'll be some. Rather shady, isn't it? You're worried? L don't give a damn! The end justifies the means. What are you going to do? Guess. See if you're clever. - L'm not clever. - Listen to me... Her main problem is the dough question. The old man cut off the allowance. L doubt she has much. L'll see to it she doesn't find any. L've the list of her acquaintances. A few calls and it's done. They're told the girl's a slut, she drinks, she takes drugs, parties out... Anything you like. And that she tries to hit on everyone. Also that the family... ...won't pay her debts. You think it'll work? Of course it'll work. Good excuse to keep their dough! L'll visit her neighbors, her boss, And l'll tell them the same yarn. L'll weave a big cobweb... A big cobweb! And she'll be caught in it, alone. When one's alone, one makes blunders. She'll be clever if she gets out of it. What are you thinking about? Guess! That's all you think about! Here's the boyfriend. Madam is sure to see them! He looks serious. Must be the husband. L'm Allan Jordan, Mrs. Regnier's lawyer. If you need any help, any advice, call me up. May l have your phone number? 16-18-26. May l sit down with you, from time to time? You've a fine outlook from here. My little boy is across, in the hospital. How is he? Better, but it's no fun for him. His Dad visited him? He's in hospital too? L'm Mrs. Marino. He's with his folks because l'm filing for a divorce. What game are you playing? Tarots. It's an officer's game. Do you play cards? Poorly. Your cards seem odd. They're very pretty. More beautiful than ordinary cards. She's young... ...she looks lost. She'll marry again! Yes, it's awfully sad, l agree. But you see what l'm saying? Don't mention it. Good-bye, Sir. Aren't l a genius? A swine, you mean. Good day, Ladies and Gentlemen! The bread. Doctor, if you want some slices. No, don't worry, l won't have time. L'm in a hurry. Good day. Good morning, Madam. Did you sleep well? Very well, thank you. Mr. Mostel, your slices are longer and longer. That's correct. His fees can't pay for his food. It's really not my fault... ...if this country is under-developed. L'm the first to regret it. L haven't had the honor of being introduced to you. The draconian... and slightly obsolete... regulations... ...are to blame! L am... Gerard Mostel, actor... Or rather, if you wish... ...tragedian. In short, theatrical actor. Imagine how these times confuse me. L know your name, Madam. And also that your son is... ...in our dear hospital. Don't you see any divination there... ...nor uncanny gift. L had only to listen to the suggestions of these three charming people... ...whom l like to see as the legendary Parcae. They possess the same elegance and tenacity. Hours of nice words, but bad tempered... Don't believe a word and allow me... ...to present you with this bread. This humble homage will, l hope, ...prevent our draconian moralist... ...to knit her pretty brows. Don't wake him up, please. - How is he? - Much better! It's very good for him to keep sleeping like this. Come back after lunch. Are you hiding something? Of course not. We hide only bad news. He's already played with the others. Didn't you play with Michel before he slept? Has anybody come to see him? His grandparents. Sorry! You're Regnier's wife? Listen, my name's Paul Thomas. We met at a party, in Paris. Quite a while ago. You don't remember? No... forgive me... It's not important. Charles and l were kids together. L've always known him. How is he? And you? Why are you here? Be nice, come and have a drink with me. L badly need to speak to someone. You accept? Sorry, l'm not myself. What brought you to these parts? My small boy is in the hospital. Sorry to hear that. He's much better today. - A ham-sandwich and a coffee, please. - A coffee ...and a sandwich too You don't remember me at all? Helen... isn't it? L seem to remember your name, yes. L haven't seen Charles for ages. How is he? He lives at his parents'. L'm divorcing him. L see... Forgive me. Those things happen. What's the matter? That's nothing. L underwent an operation, not long ago, up there... Just got out of the hospital. Why don't you go home? Listen, l guess l must tell someone. They say they removed everything, but still... ...l have to come back every other day. Not very cheerful, is it? Follow the treatment, and you'll soon be all right. Perhaps. L lack pluck to live a normal life again. What do you do in life, Mr. Thomas? Several things. But call me "Paul". Where do you live? Me, l don't know, l've left my home. L live across the street, in a boarding house. Do they accept men on their last legs? L promise l won't die there. Oh my god. Sorry, l'm self-pitying. Excuse me. Don't mention it. Let's be practical. If l have to come back to this dump every two days... ...you must come and ask if there are rooms available. The place is old-fashioned, but inexpensive. L have no reason to save money. Here l go again! Do you want some stamps? Air mail? There's a box just outside. L'll just take a second. See how swift it was? - Thanks. - No problem. It does me a lot of good to see you. Have dinner with me? No. L don't think l can. L mustn't. Thanks all the same. Well, then, another time. Please! L wanted to offer you dinner, let me pay for this! You can't imagine... ...how happy l am to have met you. There l was not knowing what to do and... ...you came. So what's 15 francs? For me it's a lot because l'm in a difficult situation. Won't you drink your coffee? And your sandwich? L'll take it. Where's your boarding house? You'll see, l'll show you. It's on the right. Look it's that way. You can't miss it. There's a big hedge... ...l'd better not accompany you. The land-lady is a bit... ...you know, she's against mixing sexes. See you soon. Thank you. It's l who thanks you! That's Mr. Mostel. A tenant who's an actor. He's rehearsing. This way... Here's the room. It will do fine! If you allow me, l'll take it. Does the sign l saw outside... ...mean the house will disappear? Yes. In September. What a pity to see all those houses go. Boarding-houses are indispensable, especially single ones. Alas, l don't know where my tenants will go! - You have a closet... - I forget to tell you. Mrs. Regnier lives here? L met her at the hospital. L'm an old friend of her husband's. And l wanted to tell you... Her father-in-law is a very wealthy man. He owns a lot of houses everywhere. L think he's got one just like yours. L'll find out whether... ...he wouldn't let you rent it. After all, he'd surely be glad... ...to find a person like you... ...who'd keep it in good order. Where is it? L can't say exactly, but l'll inquire. Mr. Thomas... if you do, you'll save my life! There are miracles, sometimes! L'm glad you like the room. Quite a lot! The bathroom is large and always clean. L check it. Only Dr. Blanchard and Mr. Mostel use it. L'm particular about boarders. L'm sure you are. One thing surprises me. Does Mrs. Regnier know about September? Yes, everyone knows about it. Why doesn't she tell her father-in-law? Of course, she's so worried herself... Sorry, l opened the wrong door! Looking for the parlor? The opposite door. Are you... Mr. Pinelli? Paul Thomas, your new boarder. Elise... say hello to Mr. Thomas. Say hello to Mr. Thomas. She's a bit backward. She's charming. Forgive me. Please! L'm always busy tidying things in the cupboard. Here are the ladies l told you about. Mr. Thomas told me about the house. If you can do something, we'll bless you! Believe me, l'll do all l can. You're lovers of tarots? You can play? L know the rules. Wonderful! Would you play with us? L haven't got much time left... ...but enough, l hope, for a few games. Mrs. Pinelli told us... we're sorry. Science makes miracles. Don't lose heart. Thank you... Let's play. How are you, Helen? You found a room? L'm glad for you. Is your little boy any worse? No, Michel's quite all right. Don't worry. Good night. You won't go and cry alone in your room! Please excuse me. Tell me. That'll comfort you. Michel's grand-mother came to see him. That's why l'm upset. Emily? Yes. That's right, you know her? She's a bit... weighty, isn't she? L wonder whether she's weighty or... Why am l always to blame for everything? When Michel saw her... ...he started crying and screaming. And she said it was all my fault... ...that l set him against her and her husband. L've had quite enough! L've really had enough! Don't get into such a state! Everything fine? You're happy? The kid's much better. He seems to tease you all the time. Care for a little walk? With the best intentions. No, thanks very much. Forgive me, Ladies. Youth goes with youth! What a sad situation. Aren't you an old friend of Mrs. Regnier's? L met her once, many years ago. But l've always known her ex-husband. A divorce is always terrible. It depends, you know. One can't judge from the outside. One should know both parties grounds. Her husband, your friend, isn't very well, is he? It's hard to explain. He's a... very emotional man... ...very sensitive... There exist difficult situations... ...also unexplainable shame. A virtuous wife has more value than a ruby. And Mrs. Regnier... ...is a little flimsy? L won't judge her. Neither would l belittle her. It's not because... ...she's whimsical from time to time... Where's the virtuous girl of more value than a ruby? Who says only sublime words... ...who remains calm... ...and keeps her dignity? L pass. Again?! Five trumps! L'm going out for a little walk. You'll tell me how much l owe you but... - l'll play the return-match. - With pleasure! Let's void this deal. L thought so... she had a lover. And she must've had another one since. Not him, he's a dying man. He shouldn't go out at night. It's too cool. Sex! What a mug! L know. Believe me, this is no joke. Do you want a whisky? If you want. Hello Mr. Regnier? Paul Thomas here, reporting How are you getting along? Well, that's not easy. L'm staying in her boarding house. It's run by Mr. And Mrs. Pinelli. L know. One of my companies owns it. It's the kind she'd choose. Crazies, drunks, seniles... ...the same perversion. Yes you're right, it's a crazy place. But in order to put the old girl on our side... l said you'd find another house for her. Right. That's no problem. There's something more urgent. Both parties have taken divorce proceedings. But we... l mean Charles, was the first. The girl's lawyer is trying to hasten things. And our own lawyer thinKs he'll succeed. ...though her mouthpiece, is a bum... He won't listen to reason. So hurry! L phoned all the people she Knows in Paris... ...l visited her neighbors. Nothing against her. Or it's old news. Hurry and find something we can use. That's what l want! L've an idea. L'll tell you when l'm sure. The proof's got to be sound. What is it? Something serious? It'll be serious enough, if l find it. But that scheme... will cost money. Do it at any price! L'm in a fine mess! You leave earlier and earlier. Because l've more and more work. L'm gonna see your little boy. L'm going there presently. What a pretty dress you have, Elise! Pink suits you very well. L had feathers around my neck... ...and also on the bottom of the dress. That's sounds pretty! But there was one that wasn't nice... ...one of her drawings. You should've started over. Elise... come here! She seems to have a liking for you. Bon Appetit to all. It's a fine day ahead. The sun is the God of days! Mr. Thomas is back. L hadn't seen him go out. Will you play today? You're tempting me! L'll come down as soon as l can. We'll wait for you. - Sorry, l thought you you'd be a while. - Don't worry about it. L'll come later. No, stay. Want a drink? With pleasure. My wife misunderstands me, you know... Will the tooth-glass do? Fine. It's the content that's important. Want a shot? It can't be fun to be deprived of drinks? There's one who likes it too, here. Mrs. Regnier. You don't say! Don't tell me you're not aware of it. Well... sometimes her eyes were more or less... She's so worried! Sure! L wouldn't cast a stone at her. Elise likes her a lot. Before, it was Mostel. She adored him... ...as if he were a God. It's Mrs. Regnier now. She follows her everywhere. Mrs. Regnier is very nice with Elise. L won't tell you what was said about her. Nothing... filthy gossip. That she liked little girls. That's booshwah! Can't keep people from goofing off. L've got to finish my work now. L'm going, then. Just half an hour... Take your time. Can't you open the window? It stinks here. There'll be a draught. Put something on! How long will it last? You're not funny. You don't have to worry. You don't find anything? Nothing to be found. That girl is A.1. She's a saint... another Joan of Arc! But l'm not discouraged. Regnier doesn't care, the old hypocrite! L could kill the girl... ...he'd wash his hands. Aren't you crazy? Can you figure me as a killer? Listen, Sonia, l'm not stupid, am I? We can make our pile, and l'll chance it. L'm preparing a shrewd scheme. All l know is that l miss you. Don't talk! And listen to me. L'll make her pass for a dissolute girl. The Pinelli girl is backward. L'll prove that Helen's debasing her. You understand? You must help me. What will l do? Can you reach Bob and his gang? Can you reach them? Wait a minute... Can you, yes or crap? It's all about you! Don't talk! Shut up! L'll need some acid and soporifics... ...and also those special sweets. Hell, you can do that. Yes, but l bet they won't give it away. There's all the cash you need. Mr. Regnier? Paul Thomas speaking. May l see you tonight? No..."see" you. L need money for our business. Pour me a whisky. It's very definite. No, twice as much. It's a cinch, l tell you! O.K., agreed. See you tonight. Don't laugh, you make me sick! What is it? L must see you. What's goin' on? L have to talk to you. Come, please come! Of course that's none of my business, but... As I... l like you very much... ...not only Charles, but you too... ...and as l see how hard you're fighting... ...with little money That's right. Why don't you ask Regnier? He's so rich! It has nothing to do with me. That's childish! Let them at least pay the doctor. Do you realize it'll be hard to raise the kid? L realize it. You're terribly strong. What are you smiling at? The balloon peddler. He comes here often. We never talk but we're fond of each other. L had another blow today. L called up a friend of mine. Her husband answered curtly. It's strange. It seems someone's trying to isolate me. It's stupid. Of course it's stupid. L shouldn't tell this to you. Excuse me... Why? Have you started? Started what? Your treatment. Yes... sure... yes. L already went twice. Keep your courage. You too... keep your courage! You're late! You choose your time. L was with her. L know that. - You've got me watched? - Not you... Her. Then you know she's as white as snow, and you don't stand a chance! So you fell for her too! L should've known. Never mind. Got the dough? Don't talk to me like that! Sorry. You want your evidence, yes? You have it? L'm going to. But give the money. Don't be a fool. Go tonight! Dollars... Leave me alone! - Thank you. - What's up? My divorce. Mr. Jordan obtained a hearing very quickly. L hurried to tell you knowing it'd make you happy. Is it tomorrow? No, the day after. At 11:30. L'll come and fetch you. L promise it'll be done tonight. Don't worry about the hearing. Have her visit the house for 2 hours. It surprised me too! At 6pm... We will succeed, Mr. Regnier! That's some crazy idea! Shut up and listen. Everything has to be ready at 6:30. We'll have 15 minutes maximum. After that, you call her up as l said. And you say your stuff. O.K., but tell me everything. That's quite simple. L'll offer to take her to the airport. The nit-wit will already be in the car... Both will be gorged with drugs. L fake an accident, put Saint Helen at the wheel, and l scram. Think of the scandal! You're a smart guy! Yes, l'm a smart guy. He's exulting! L've good news for Mrs. Pinelli. She's doing the rooms. Will you play today? L hope so, Ladies! That's not a moribund! Mrs. Pinelli, wonderful news! You mustn't come into a lady's room like that! Sorry, but l'm so glad for you! Mr. Regnier phoned me: You can visit the house today. My God, it can't be true! Yes. Starting at 6 p.m. So late? L've got the address written down. 11 rue de l'Eglise Someone will be there. L can't believe it. My God, l can't believe it! How can l thank you? Your joy's my reward, dear Madam. Ladies, l'm visiting the house this evening! Is it possible? Where is it? Rue de l'Eglise Rue de l'Eglise! Miraculous! The nightmare's over and all that is thanks to Mr. Thomas! And we thought you were joking! God bless you! God bless... l'll get you some port. We'll drink a little port. Some port, Mr. Thomas? Yes... with pleasure. - Everything ok? - Yes, fine. L'm so glad to see you laugh. It's almost too fine. L'm afraid l'll be a kill-joy. The hospital has never seen your "moribund". You're sure? Isn't his name Paul Thomas? Well, he's unknown to the regiment. It doesn't surprise me. He looks about as ill as l do. It doesn't worry me at all. L'm glad to know the truth. What is it? Nothing. You have a tiptop character! We're going to x-ray your little boy. L was sure l'd find you here. L'm totally upset... l've never been so insulted... So l quickly came to warn you. So what is it? Isn't your father-in-law Ludovic Regnier? Last night, l was "ordered" to go and see him. About a leading part. Do you know, he owns two theaters and finances pictures. He's... he's terribly important. So l went, you understand, l couldn't do otherwise. My profession has its demands. He received me himself, very affably. Said he could help me get the success l deserve He thought l'd do anything... to be famous, to have my name in the press. What did he ask in return? That l make you the gossip of the town. That's why he tried to buy me! To spy on you! He told you so? Yes, straight out. As if l'd sell my honor for success! L don't know how to thank you! No, no, don't thank me. L couldn't have acted otherwise. This world is hideous! We live with a knife in the back. People aren't kind any longer. Do you know what your father-in-law thinks? He thinks that Paul Thomas and you... That you are... lovers. The fools! The fools! L'm lucky in everything. This is a lucky day for everybody. My turn to deal, right? Say, Ladies, l've an idea. L assume... ...that you will follow Mrs. Pinelli in her new house? - We certainly will. - Where could we go? L suggest you go with her to visit it. L think she'd like to be accompanied. We can't go without her asking us. L'm sure she'll be delighted. Well, Miss, you lost your shadow? The guy who used to follow you... Didn't you know? A man used to follow me? Dark and tall? The one who was with you yesterday? No, another one you don't seem to know. A short blond man. Don't worry, he isn't here today. Thanks for telling me. L would buy some balloons for my boy... ...but l don't have much money. No big deal, next time. We're ready, Mr. Thomas. - My heart's beating hard! - Ours too. It's quite an expedition. It's far but the house is worth it. Are you sure someone is there to show us? Yes. His name is on the note l gave you, it's Milamogue. All right, let's go. Keep an eye on the house. And on Elise too, because my husband... Don't worry. Look at this. Where is she? Gone with the ladies to see the house. We're alone. You don't know why l drink like this. You must despise me. You can't understand. L think of nothing else. She shouldn't forbid me. L'm forced to hide. It's since our kid was born. L can't bear it. Take her in the parlor. L don't want her to look at me... l'd like to drink alone. Elise... come in the parlor... ...we'll do some drawings. Elise, go with Mr. Thomas. Go. Go, my darling... Go! Here Elise, ...take a candy. Take a candy. You'll do a nice drawing. A nice drawing... with your chalk... We'll show it to Helen. To Mrs. Regnier. To Helen. L want to do a nice drawing for Helen. You're happy, aren't you? Look at the nice drawing Elise did for you. You see, Elise... Helen is very glad. Helen is glad. She'll show you pretty pictures. She's always like this? L had her swallow a special sweet. Can we show the nice pictures to Elise, my dear Helen? Yes, show the beautiful pictures. Look at the nice pictures with Helen. Yes, look at the pretty pictures. You see them? You have a very lovely dress Look... ...feel how soft it is. It's soft! Want a whisky? L think, my dear Helen, it's time for you to get cozy. Look, Elise... look at Helen. It's Helen. How's your son? Very well. The X-ray went well... And you? I...? L'm going up to my room. You don't like the night. Same as I. Neither nights nor days. So long! Too stupid! For you, Mrs. Regnier. A certain Miss Rousselet. Sorry to have answered it. L thought... Are you Mrs. Regnier? Good evening. L'm the niece of your friend Mrs. Rousselet. She received your letter... but couldn't answer sooner, Mrs. Rousselet. She came bacK yesterday. She asKed me to inform you... that she'll arriee t-night. Yes, but how? She said: "Helen must need me". So she'll arriee at the airport tonight. She's awfully kind. A small problem, l can't pick her up at the airport. L'm overworked. She asKs if you couldn't go there. She's awfully anxious to see you. So if you can possibly... It's the least l can do! And it makes me so happy. You can't understand. Wait, l've written down the flight number. Bitch! Sabena Flight 958, landing at 8:30 p.m. My husband will be there. - Did you write it down? - Yes. Count on me. L hope we'll see each other. Thanks, goodbye. Happy news? A friend of mine is arriving from Paris. L'm not alone any more. L'll win! L'm glad to hear that. Helen, l'm standing by you, believe me. L know you're not ill and you spy on me. You brought me luck! L've got to confess something. Listen, please. It's true, l'm not sick. Father Regnier asked me to watch you. - I know that. - Forgive me, please. L'm so ashamed. L admit it was ugly, but l didn't understand. Now l know he was completely wrong about you. L told him so, and l'll repeat it. You're a good person. Exactly the mother Michel needs. L beg you to forgive me. L'm so sorry... so ashamed. Let me do something for you. Let me take you to the airport. Then l'll know you've forgiven me... Please! No, l won't. Don't be spiteful. Understand me. L know you're not mean. No, l can't afford the luxury. What do you mean? Come, tell me. Or l'll never forgive myself. Don't be stupid! It won't be a disaster if l go alone. Helen, don't go! It's impossible! To make me happy let me at least give you a candy. That's enough! We're not kids anymore. It can't be true... It can't be. Return the girl. Please, is the flight from Paris late? Yes. The 8:30 flight is late. You're making a mistake. L was told 8:30 p.m., Sabena Flight 958. Sabena 958... No, it doesn't exist. How is it not here? Are you getting in? Where to? Woods Square. Wait. What's the exact time? 8:50 p.m. Look at me. It's very important. Can you recognize me? What's this business? Please! You'll be able to recognize me? Yes... What's up? You're so white. Are you ill? No, don't worry. It's all right... Go on. Wait a minute. Pay the taxi, please. L'm here to see Charles. L suppose he's in his room. Shall l pay the taxi, Madam? Certainly. We weren't expecting her. L thought... never more... my little Helen. Is Michel all right? My God... have you... forgiven me? L remember everything, you know. Yes, Michel's quite well. Yes, l've forgiven you, you know that. But... understand... l can't any more... Yes, l know. L understand. But... please listen... ...l'd like... to see you... from time to time. Yes, l understand. But... Listen, l don't know how to explain... l must take him to Paris, you see. We must leave here. Don't speak... don't. Stay with me. L would so much like... You see... it's as if l were dead, here. Maybe we could try. We could put him in a different room. L know it's impossible. Are you better? Sometimes, it starts all over again, but... ...but l don't take drugs any more... l don't know... don't know... ...l want you to stay always with me. Stay with me! Listen, Charles... Listen to me... l came to tell you l have no more money Why? Where are you living? In a boarding house... ...just across from Michel's hospital... ...at Mrs. Pinelli's. Why haven't you got any money left? Why am l still alive?! We'll find a way... listen... Be patient a little longer... What's going on here? Leave them alone. What? L'm telling my husband l've got no more money. Your husband? You want money, l understand? No, no, you don't understand. Good-bye. Come here... in my study. L want to know why you came here. This way! L asked Charles to leave you. He never could. And now he'll never be able to! No scene here! Not here! Yes Helen, please, not here. Why be so cruel, Mr. Regnier? It's odious. Your spy stole all my money. You gave him orders! You're insane! Oh my God... No more money... Certainly, we'll give you some money. Why are you here? To prevent the divorce? No, l can't afford it, and that's a pity. You owe me 250 francs. And 150 for the plane. That's 400 francs. Here they are! Here they are! You don't think l had anything to do with this theft business? - Poor child, she's upset. - Here. Wait! You can't go out in the streets like this. Tell the chauffeur... ...to take Madam wherever she wishes. Please! Sit down a moment. Will you have something to drink? It'd do you good. L can't even tell you what l think of you! L'll wait outside. L'm very sorry. It's crazy! Tell me what happened. L don't know. L stayed in this room all evening. L'm no warden! He only thinks of himself! Ladies, please! L have my own worries! Where's Mrs. Regnier? And Mr. Thomas? He promised to look after Elise. And my husband is dead-drunk! What's going on? L don't understand, my daughter's lying all dressed in bed and l can't wake her up. L wasn't feeling well, so l went to bed. But Helen was here with Elise. She'll tell you. Where is she? She told me, she was going to the airport. Here she is in a big Mercedes. What! Was Elise with you? No... Why? She's asleep all dressed, It's impossible to wake her. Help her. L really can't. You met your friend at the airport? Listen you... l don't know if you're behind all this. L don't understand about Elise... ...nor about the airport. Or why my money is gone. If that was to be a frame-up, it failed! Get it?! L saw Charles. And l'll go to the hearing tomorrow... ...and l'll keep my boy... ...and we'll go to Paris. L'm tired, but l still have all my strength. And l'm not an automation. And my spirit is healthy And l'm going to bed! Don't think l don't give a damn! Don't let her throw you off balance. Calm down, Mrs. Pinelli. You'll talk to Elise when she wakes up. You'd better let her sleep. And you should go to bed too. We'll all go to bed! What's up? A conspiracy? Don't worry, l'll have my coffee outside. It'll be ready in 10 minutes. L don't have 10 minutes. The coffee mill's jammed. No coffee. Mrs. Pinelli attended to Elise. What's the matter? She's sleeping. L wonder if she was given a drug or sleeping pills? L was told you weren't so well yourself. Good day, Doctor. How's Elise? Still asleep. L haven't left her one minute. And there's no coffee. Never mind. L'll get the orange juice. We visited the house last night with the ladies. It's large, but rather unkempt. There's much to be done. L'm glad Mr. Thomas could do that for you. You don't like him? L think... l rather pity him. Helen, don't think l've forgotten what you told me yesterday. L know it'll take time to regain your trust. Believe me, l had no part in what happened to you yesterday. As l had no part in what happened to Elise. The whole thing is unimportant. - Lf you want me to apologize, l will. - Please. You've seen Charles? How is he? Very bad. And very sad. She's awake but says incredible things. My little girl. She keeps calling: "Helen!" Helen! It's so sweet... l feel funny... What did you do to her? L don't know anything. What do you mean, Elise? Come with me to see Helen. Helen's here! Helen's here! No, the other Helen, and the moving pictures. And the naked gentleman, and the ladies... It's good! What's the matter? L don't know... everything's changing... l want to see the men and women and the other Helen. Take me there... Damned if l understand! L'm myself no more... Complete nonsense! You put something in the orange juice You put something in the orange juice? How beautiful you are. L've always known it. L mustn't forget my little boy. You're a scoundrel! Please... my little boy... l must get ready. L don't want to fly away! L want to remain a human being... Try and understand. Come, let's not leave her alone! Let's be loyal to our sex and motherhood! We must be her guardian angels! The old lunatics! What are you doing? L'm getting dressed. L'm going out. You can't do that! We're all going with you to the hearing, shortly. Helen's in trouble. L better go. She's gonna help me. Helen can do nothing. Dad is taking care of everything. L want Helen! To hell with the rest! To hell with Michel too! Charles! Daddy won't be pleased. To hell with what father thinks! Why do you want to see her? She knows me. She understands me. Please! Pull yourself together, Charles! L haven't much time left. Let me go! Let me go! Blue... ...blue... Blue is very important! "Pleasures of love Last only one moment..." Come, sing with me. My friend! L know who you are. You are God. You do things in order to protect me. Don't keep your angels prisoners. You can't keep them like this, they suffer. Set them free, please! L beg you! Let them go... answer my prayers... l'm following them! Who'll pay for them? Us! We'll pay you! Charles! Stop! Stop, Charles... don't be a jerk! Self-defense! He rushed towards me... ...he attacked me! Self-defense! L couldn't kill anyone. Self-defense... l want to see my son. L'm going to see my son...
