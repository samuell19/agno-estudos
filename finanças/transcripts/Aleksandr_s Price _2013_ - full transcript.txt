I'm a little nervous. Sorry. Relax. Just relax. Take your time and talk to me, Um, wow was your day? This is really embarrassing for me. You don't have to be embarrassed. I'm not here to judge you. My day was good, but... I need help. Would you like to start by telling me why you're here? About two years ago, my mother, my sister and I moved here and we were very excited about it. Our plan was to start a new life here in New York City. Russia isn't exactly a fairy tale and my mother had a friend and she was going to give her house keeping work. So, in the meantime, we would just hang around. Where did you learn English? We were very poor, but my mother had an American friend and he would give me classes since I was 15. SHe in turn would clean for him so... That's very impressive. Your mom's very smart. You speak very well. Thank you very much. Sure. Anyway, soon enough, my mother lost her job and she started to drink. Despite everything that happened, she was a very good mother I really miss her. What happened? She lost control of the situation. See, my mother used to take very strong medication to control her depression. Why was she depressed? Nikoly Ivanov, my father left my mother when I was just born, and since then, she hasn't been very healthy. She's always been on antidepressants. Sorry to hear that. Anyway, my mother had always wanted to come to America because she knew that my father, her ex-boyfriend came to New York City for a better life without us. And she just wanted to find him very badly. Did you find him? No, no we didn't. And the thing is, once she realized that she'd never find him, she stopped taking her medication. She didn't tell us and then, one day, not too long ago, she um... she killed herself. [crying] You can imagine how it became for me without her. In a city like New York. So big, So crowded... The sense of loneliness is just profound. Suffocating at times. How did she kill herself? She cut her wrist. That afternoon, we had a fight and I left. I'm so sorry about your loss. I know that you must feel overwhelmed, but you have to believe me, it will get better. There is so much more to it than the death of my mother. I have went through a tough year. I have done things that I am not proud of. Things I never thought I would. And it just keeps getting worse. There is no way out. Everyone deserves a second chance. You're a good person. I can tell by the look in your eyes. Anyway, after my mother died, I needed to talk to a friend. I don't have many, but I had Emma. Hi. I'm so sorry. Why do I have to live life like this? I can't keep living like this. Life's unfair. I know. I'm here for you though. OK. You'll be alright. To be honest, I don't even think I can cry any more. I understand. How's your sister doing with all of this? Is she OK? Um, Angelika, um she left. She has left and she hasn't told me were she is going to. I went home and all of her stuff was gone. What? What do you mean she left? Did she say anything? Did she leave a note? No. She didn't. And the thing is, she took all of the savings my mother had. I have nothing. I don't know how I am going to make it. How will I pay for things? OK. Relax. You can find a job. No, I can't, Emma. I am not legal to work. What am I supposed to do? OK. OK. You're a smart boy. OK? You'll figure it out. I'll help you. New York City has plenty of opportunities. OK? Maybe you're right. Just trust me. You'll figure it out. You'll figure it out. Did she help you? Yes, she did. She sure did. She hooked me up with someone she knew. Emma had given me a number of a friend of hers. We met and he told me how he could help me. I just didn't expect what I was told. What were you told? James, that was his name. He offered me to dance. Not your average job. To dance? Uh, are you a dancer? No, I'm not. Well, I wasn't at the time. What kind of dancing are we talking about? That requires your clothes off. - Any questions? - Yes. What am I suppose to do now? You dance. That's what we pay you for. Do your thing. Alright? Remember, tips are a big part of your pay check. So get in to it. Did you take the job? I did. Hey, what's your name? My name is Aleksander. I'm Christian. - Nice to meet you. - NIce to meet you. Hey, I'm Jason. Everyone calls me Jas. Hi, my name is Eric. Don't worry. They'll try to eat you like you're [inaudible], but you won't let them. If you get in to any trouble they'll take care of you. Don't worry. I'll be keeping a close eye on you as well. OK? New York City has the hottest guys. It won't take too long for you to find a boyfriend. Are you single? Yes, I am. Oh, I forgot, you have a gaydar for single men. That's right bitch. How did that experience make you feel? It's just dancing really. What do you mean? Right. I just mean, did it make you feel uncomfortable? No. Actually, after a while, I liked it. Knowing that everyone was watching me and that they wished they could be with me... It made me feel powerful for once. Powerful. That's a strong word. Yeah. It is. It sure is. The night I was asked to pole dance, that's when it all started. Wait, I got condoms right here. Let me give you blow job first. OK. Oh shit, dude. OH, c'mere! I'm gonna fuck you so good! No! not yet! I can't wait to fuck you man. It's my first time. It's ok, I've just never had sex in there. You telling' me you never been fucked in the ass before? Yes. Want me to fuck you? Yes, but be gentle please. OK? Alright. Good morning, beautiful. Sleep OK? Yeah, thank you. Good. Listen, I gotta get to work. I had a great time last night. Maybe we can do it again some day. Oh here. That should cover you. What is this? There's $500 there. It usually covers the guys I sleep with. I think I'm pretty generous. Wait, uh. I'm not sure I understand. Alright. You're not one of those guys who wants a relationship are you? Because I don't. Dude, I'm straight. I just like to pay little hotties like you every now and then. Good ass by the way. I'll come looking for you when I need you. But I gave you my number lat night. Yeah, I know. I'll call you when I need you. What was I suppose to do? Not take the money? I wasn't exactly in a position where I could complain. Plus, $500. I would never make that amount in a regular job. Can you believe that? He was married or had a girlfriend or something. But, in any case, he came for a second round. Fuck baby, you got the best fuckin ass, man. Shit! Fuck! [climaxing] Oh man. Fuck. Man, you got a fuckin good ass, dude. I love fuckin you. Listen, I don't think I want to do this any more. What do you mean? You don't like spending time with me? No, it's not that. I just don't think it's right that I take any more money from you. I told you about that. It means nothing to me. Seriously. Chill. But it means something to me. Well, I can fuck you for free if you want, but I told you, I am not going to do a relationship. You understand? Never mind. So I figured, the next morning, I would drop some resumes. Just to see if I could get a job. To be honest, I was exhausted. I had been walking around the entire city for the whole day. I just wanted to have a drink and go home. Welcome. How are you? Vodka with ice please. You got it. I got this. - It's OK. Thank you. - No, please. [inaudible] Thank you very much. You did not say that - shut up. I know - dude. ...I did I can't believe it I know. I know. I got you. You did. What? Nothing. Just a bit of a headache. Oh, can I get you an aspirin? No, it's OK. I'm fine. I'm just not used to drink. I'm fine. Thanks, though. You know what, I think I'm going to just go home. I had a great time. Really? I was just going to invite you to my room if that's cool with you. Um yeah.. Wait... - I don't usually do that. - I know you don't. You do? OK. Why not? After the day I had, I figured it'd be nice to spend the night with someone, you know. Feel loved. He got me liquored up. That's for sure. And he invited me to his room. He was so nice so I did not hesitate much. I got to admit it. His eyes, his lips, his touch... He felt so good. Did you like it? Did I like it? What do you think? I'm just wondering. I like knowing what guys like. What do you like? I didn't like it. I loved it. You are amazing. Thank you. I liked it too. Still have a headache? You know, you really are worth every penny. Excuse me, what is this? What do you think it is? I'm paying you for your services. Services?! What are you talking about? I'm not a prostitute. Seriously? Who are you kidding here? The way you sucked me off, the way you let me fuck you... I can tell you're a professional. A professional?! It's OK. That is the second time I have ever slept with a guy! What? Riiight. Hey, what is the matter? Why are you going? Hey, I paid you for the night! Don't touch me! That is the moment I guess I became an escort. Once you're in, it changes who you are. How did you feel? At that moment, worthless, dirty, used. I felt as if I had lost a part of me. I did lose a part of me that day. But, with time I have come to realize, it's actually pleasant. After walking around the city, I thought that maybe what just happened, wasn't so bad after all. I mean, I had earned a good amount in a short period of time. I guess I couldn't complain really. Not in my circumstances. Hey. How are you? I'm OK. How are you? I'm great. You look good. How are things going? They're going, you know. Yeah, did you meet with James? Yeah. I did. Good I told you he'd help you. So what are you doing now? Are you working with him? Yes... I started to dance for him. You're dancing for him? I'm dancing at the gay club. That's what I meant. Oh. I never thought you'd do anything like that. Me neither. He offered me that. I wasn't in a position to say no, so I thought I would give it a try. Huh. So uh, how come you never told me about this before? I mean, are you gay? What are you doing?! I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know what I want. I'll see you around - OK? Bye. So confusing. I thought that by kissing her I would probably become straight. But am I even gay? Having sexual intercourse with men would actually indicate that you are at least bisexual. That of course if you also feel attracted to women. Is that the case? It's OK. That's OK to be confused. You will eventually figure it out. You're still young. Anyway, shortly after, I wanted to dance again. And I went to another club. I liked it the first time. Hi. I'm sorry. My name's Billy. We didn't mean to stare, but me and my pals were wondering if you'd like to go to a cool bar downtown. Wondering if you'd like to grab a drink? - Sure. - Cool. Let's do it. ♪♪ Thank you for inviting me guys. I had a great time. We had a great time too, Aleksander. Wait. Where are you going? Um, home I guess? Why? You're not coming with us? You're not coming with me? I don't really know you. Any of you. You just met me. At the bar. Don't you remember? Where are you headed? We're just going back to my place for a little while. What for? It's a little late. Just hang out. Yeah, dude. Hang out. OK. I guess I could come for a bit. Actually, I'm gonna head home, guys. You coming, Babe? You know what? I think I'm going to go with them. See you tomorrow? Oh, OK. Seeya. See you guys. - This is your place? - Yep. It's nice. [snorting sound] You got a problem? No, I don't. Here. What is this? What do you think it is? It's a magic mix I made for you. Just drink it. You'll like it. What the fuck did you do?! I know. How much did you spend? It's yours. You bought it, man. What? [laughing] Nothing like coke on a weekday. [laughter] It's Saturday. Hey, it's your turn. C'mon. You'll like it. It's his turn. [mumbling] I have to go to the bathroom. Get him! Get him! Get him! Hey! [eerie music plays] Hey! Where ... Don't fucking touch me! Fucking asshole! [dry heaving] I felt terrible. I couldn't remember what I had done or with whom. With all the drinking and drugs I just blacked out. Do you use drugs often? Actually, that was the first time. I had never done this before. I swear. The problem though, is... I started to use more often after that one time. Not that I wanted to do it deliberately, it just kept coming my way. Kind of like being an escort. I felt hopeless. You know that you control your life. Never let a bad situation take over. Yeah. I guess it is easier said than done, no? Hello. Uh, who? Who is this again? Oh Keith, hi. How's it going? Uh, tonight? You know, I don't really... Oh, I will be there. Yeah, $500 will be fine. OK see you. Right. Aleksander? - Tom? - Yeah! Were you listening to my conversation? No. I just saw you and thought I'd say hello. Oh, hello then. So what's up? You live around this neighborhood? Not really. It's just my day off. So, how was last night? A blur. I mean literally. I don't remember much. I think Billy must have put something in my drink, but he wouldn't really do that right? Billy really isn't one to be trusted. I meant to tell you. What do you mean? He's a bit of a tool. He takes advantage of guys every chance he gets. That's comforting to know. No. No. I didn't mean it like that. I think we all must have had some... Wasn't one of them your boyfriend? - Joel? - Right. Nah, not really. We've been dating on and off for about a month. I talked to him this morning and we broke up yet again. But I thought you just said you're not dating. It's complicated. It always is, no? Anyway, I'm going to go home. I'm really tired. Yeah. Sure. - Was nice seeing you - You too. Get some sleep. [inaudible] Hey! Yes? I don't know. Maybe you might want to have coffee with me some time? Are you asking me out on a date? Just coffee, really. Oh, sounds nice. Great. What's your number? Oh here. Thanks. Alright, I'll see you. Bye. Aleksander? Oh, hi. You alright? Yeah. Why? Just asking. Um, do you want to have a drink? No, actually, we should get going. I got something to do later. Oh fuck! Come here. You can stay the night if you want. Check out's not till 12 PM. You're leaving? Dude, I told you. I got a date. Why do you get so cold after we've had sex? I'm not cold. I'm just doing my thing. Oh, I almost forgot. I have this business partner. He's dying to meet you. What are you now? My pimp? That's funny. Relax, man. Anyways, his number's in the envelope. He pays big time. You really should give him a call. Trust me. Hey. Hey. I'm just trying to help you out man Get you some more work. OK? Hi. John? Yes. It's Aleksander. Yes. He's told me you'd like to see me. - Hello. - Hi. - It's John. - Aleksander. Nice to meet you. Thank you. You like it? Can we have drink and talk a little first? Get to know each other. So, anything you want to tell me about you? You're the one who wants to talk so talk! So, you're friends with Keith? We work together sometimes. Why? Just making conversation. How old are you? What question is that to make coming from an escort? What's that suppose to mean? [mocking tone] What's that suppose to mean? I'm 36. - Right. - What do you mean, "right"?! Nothing. Just, um you don't look... Uh... You look great. - I have a white BMW. - OK. Do you want to know how much I earn? Sure. I bet it will be as impressive as your car. I make 6 figures a year honey. Good for you. You're not impressed? Look, I'm not sure why you're tell me all this. As long as you can pay me, it's cool with me. - I'm telling you I'm rich! - And I got that. You know, I don't we're getting off to a very good start. I'm very impressed. You're very handsome and I would love to go for a ride in your white BMW some time. Something wrong? You're a fucking, cock sucking scumbag! What's wrong with you?! You're just a cheap rent boy! This really isn't necessary. I'm going to fuck you and show you how to shut up your filthy cock sucking mouth, you cheap fuck! Let go of me you freak! You're a fucking prostitute. I may be a prostitute but you're a fucking asshole which is worse! Come back here you stupid bitch! I guess I've always been weird. Russia wasn't much different for me. Do you like sex? Are you kidding? I have sex for a living. That doesn't necessarily mean that you enjoy it. Therefore my question is: Do you enjoy it? I don't know. I just feel very lonely. That is the closest I get to interacting with anyone. Thank you for bringing me here. My pleasure. This is really good. Yeah, this place has some of the best coffee in the city. No, I mean being here with you. The coffee tastes really good too. No problem. I don't have much of a social life. That is why it is nice to be here with you. I'm serious. I'm serious. Don't make fun of my accent. No, it's really cute. Thank you. So, you don't have much of a social life, huh? Are you being sarcastic? You know, you seem like a very nice, sweet young man. There's something off about you. Off? What do you mean? Well, the other night, you went home with my friends. What's up with that? And again, I don't usually do that. I told you. You don't have to lie to me. What makes you think that I am lying? Aleksander, my friends told me what you guys did that night. What is it that they told you? Basically everything, but don't get mad. I see. Now you're judging me, right? No. What you do is your business. My business? Who said it's a business?! It's just an expression. The point is, I just don't think that someone who is bad at socializing would ever do something like that. Don't get me wrong... And tell me Tom, did you enjoy what you heard? Pardon me? You enjoy it? Oh I bet your friends told you all the details. Things I probably don't even remember. I'm not sure I'm following you. Did you enjoy hearing I got fucked in the ass? Shh! Quiet! There's other people around! What Tom? Are you embarrassed may take you for a perv? Being with someone who's 20 years younger than you? Yeah, and you can stop that right now. Did Joel tell you what I did to him? Stop it now! Not only did the 3 of them fuck me, but I swallowed Joel's cum and I loved it. Would you shut up! I think you know me a little better now. Maybe I am not so bad at socializing after all. But you know what? I shouldn't have come here in the first place. You seemed to be a nice understanding guy and you're just as judging as everyone else. Wait! Don't bother calling me again. This was a mistake. I'm sorry. Is masterbating something that helps you release tension? Yes. Isn't that the reason why people masterbate in the first place? Well, there's a difference between doing it with someone or to pleasure yourself or to do it because of conflict. And tell me Dr. Mary: Wouldn't you love for me to cum all over your face? I love it all. Man, woman, dirty, and fitly. Aleksander? Aleksander? Aleksander?Aleksander? I see. Hello? Yes, I'm fine. Tom, I just don't like people being intrusive. That's all. I sure don't want to see you any time soon. Yeah, I will think about it. OK bye. - Hey. - Hey. How's it going? Good. Good. You? Almost there? My name's Dick. Fair enough, Dick. Bad boy - heh. Hello? Hello? Hello? [apartment door buzzing] I want to take you to a restaurant tonight. You don't have to do that. But I want to. And I just feel horrible about what happened. So let me take you out. I just really need to make it up to you. It's unnecessary, but if it'll make you feel better then OK. Thank you, Emma. The truth is that I have missed seeing you. Since the loss of my mother and sister, I have been feeling very lonely. You are my best and only friend. You know, I've been meaning to ask you about that. Have you met anyone lately or made any friends at work or anything? At work? Yeah. At the club. I mean you're still dancing right? [phone ringing] Right, right, the club. Um, I don't go around often. Did you find another job? No. Why? Well, how are you making rent? And paying for food, and clothes, and stuff? Hey Aleksander, what's going on? So, what time will we meet tonight? Aleksander. You know, they say the food is excellent and a lot of fancy people frequent that place. Hey Aleksander, can you answer my question please? What? What is it? Where are you getting all of this money from? What money? What the hell is wrong with you?! I think I'm getting lost. OK. Have have you managed to produce if you're not working? After what you put me through, I don't really think you're in a position to ask me how I make living. But... Stripping! A guy my age. At that period! Seriously? You brought me to where I am. I brought you where?! Brought me to do things I never thought I would. Like what? Like having sex for money for instance. Pushing and pushing and pushing till you get what you want! Happy?! No. No. This is really unfair. What sort of friend introduces another friend to a guy who auditions boys for strip clubs? That's unfair! OK. First of all, I didn't know he would offer you that. OK and secondly, it's up to you to take a job or not. Don't blame me for your bad decisions. Of course, it's always me. I'd forgotten everything that happens to me is my fault. Oh, come on! Aleksander! You know what, Emma?! Forget about tonight, yeah?! Aleksander! Keith? Yeah? Can we talk for a second? I'm kind of in a hurry. OK. What is it? I like spending time with you and... Me too. Do you think we could do this more often? Don't you think we do it often enough already? We can keep going here here occasionally right? Things are going good. My like is kind of lonely right now and uh... Aleksander, can we not do this right now, please? I really need a connection with someone more than just the sex.. I have to get ready. I have to get ready! Please. OK. Hey. I think you're really cool, man. For real. You're a good guy, Aleksander. Maybe you need to meet someone new if what you're looking for is a serious relationship. If you find that someone, just go for it. You deserve it But you probably should stop doing the work you've been doing. Just think about it OK? I'm sorry. I really got to go. Hey, why don't you watch where you're going? [Emma moaning] [echoing laughter] Hello. Sit, please. So, it was good to hear from you. Thanks for that. You're welcome. So what's up? Is everything OK? I don't know. So why did you want to see me? I guess I wanted to have some company. Why me? Seriously? I mean don't take it the wrong way but... I get it. You didn't have anyone else did you? I'm your last resort, right? It's not like that. Besides, I feel that I owe you an apology. I don't know what's going on with me. Something's wrong. Really? I'm being serious. I am sorry about the things I said. It was really mean. Apology accepted. Thank you. You made this really easy. Good. So now are you going to tell me who you are? My mother died a few months ago. My sister left without saying goodbye. And I am illegal in this country. And I have sex for money. And I hate myself for it. That is who I am. It's going to be alright. That must have been a lot for you. You can only imagine. Are you looking for him? Who? My father? Yeah No, of course not. That was my mother's dream. It was her highlight. I don't even think I would want meet him ever. He ruined my family's life. My life. I understand. Well, for what it's worth, I think you're a good, strong person, Aleksander You just need to shift your way in a different direction and everything will be fine. I'm trying. I really am. Sounds good. You seem like a very nice guy. I am. I said you seem like one. Let me be the judge of that. Sounds fair. So how exactly do I prove to you that I'm a good guy? You know what? I think that you already did. - Oh, um... - I'm sorry. I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. No. You don't need to explain yourself. I'm the one who's crossing the line here. Really? Of course. Aleksander, I'd rather keep a friendship with you than nothing at all. I have been feeling very lonely, but I'm just not ready to be with someone yet. Goodnight, Tom. The more lonely I felt, the more I got immersed into sex. I even found my next client through craigslist. Things went from bad to worse. - Hey, I'm Aleksander - Shhhh. Don't talk. Just do as your told. Mae Lee, please take our guest with you. Get him ready. Make him a beautiful woman. Thank you for doing this. Not a problem. Is he nice? Is he nice? The guy you work for? I'm not suppose to talk to you. OK. Well, you seem nice. Please Mae Lee, you can go now. Thank you, Sir. See you tomorrow. I'll be your host tonight. I got that. You are perfection. Listen, I have never done this before. But you seem just fine. So uh, what is it you want me to do? Should I act feminine? Aren't you gay? Yeah, I uh, I'm anything you want me to be tonight. Good. Let's sit down. So host, what is your real name? No. No. No questions But No buts. Look over there. There's $5,000 in that envelope. $5,000?! $5,000 You can take it after tonight. But you're going to have to be a very naughty girl. You take it up the butt? Yeah, I mean, what else? Here, have another drink. A little more, A little bit more. OK. Where is the bathroom? You alright? No. My head hurts Let me help you. Take this. Come one. I don't have all night Are you awake? That's my boy. Or should I say girl? I'm confused. See I don't really like gay boys. They ruin peoples' lives. They're disgusting human beings. God, I hate you. I'd kill you but I don't want to get my couch dirty with your blood. I'm gonna fuck your ass right now! I'm gonna fuck you like you've never been fucked! Because I don't want hear your voice, I've given you the fuckin date rape drug. I have $5,000 in that envelope, and I'm not gonna pay you shit! Huh?! You fucking faggot! Fucking homo! You like my cock in your hole? Huh?! God, I hate you! You owe me an explanation. I haven't heard from you in weeks. What's going on Aleksander? I'm really worried about you. Why won't you talk to me? You asked me to come here. I got raped last night. What? A guy, a client raped me. Are you OK? How did it? Do you report it to the police? I can't report it. I was doing something illegal while I'm illegal. You got to stop this Aleksander. I think, I deserve it. Excuse me? I deserve it. It's in my cards. I have sex for money. It was only a matter of time before something like this would happen. You be serious. Ok just. tell me you're in shock and you don't know what you're saying Ok? My father left us. My mother kills herself. My sister then leaves me. Do you see a pattern? Because I do. I got raped. It's pattern. It was meant to happen. It's OK. I just wanted to tell you. Just let it out. You need help. You need to get yourself checked. This person could be sick. I don't think so. I mean, I lost track of how many people I have slept with for the past few months anyway. Well, did he at least do it with a condom on? I don't know. I was drugged. I didn't... In any case, if I was infected, what is the worst that could happen? Die? Then it's be the end of this. Please don't say that! I'm so sorry. It's OK. Look, you really need to quit this. Don't give me lecture now. I'm not. I'm not lecturing you. I just care about you. I just want to help you. You can't help me Emma, This is who I am now. But you can change that. I can try but... Yeah, I think you should. i will think about it. Hey there! Hi. Hey you! Come here. Do we know each other? You don't know me, but I know you. I want you to blow me. Excuse me! You heard me! I want you to suck my cock. No! I know what you are. What is that? A whore. Let go of me. I wouldn't do that if I were you. I'm a cop. What do you want? I didn't do anything? You know that prostitution's illegal?! I'm! I'm! Wait. I know all about your situation. There's nothing we can't fix right? So you suck it and maybe I'll forget all about it. We got a deal? You even dare and I'll ship your ass back to Russia tomorrow. That's right. It's $200 for a blow job and $500 to fuck. Yeah, good try. It's free for me. Consider it a favor for not turning you in. Now move. I don't have all fucking day. That's a lot you've gone through Yeah. You got raped and you tried to commit suicide. I know. It's really unfair. Life's hard. No one ever said it was easy. You've go from growing up without a father figure, to losing you mother, and you've sucked into this spiral of negativity and bad company. But things do get better. They will get better. I promise. How can you be so sure about it? Because I have faith in you. That is the first time that anyone ever said something like that to me. Are you sure? Maybe you haven't been listening very closely. There are people who care about you in your life. You just got to give them some room. Hi! How's everything? Good. Good. You? Things are great! A little sad. Especially after you turned me down. You know that I don't really... I'm joking. I'm kidding. Oh. You are? Yeah. I met someone actually. Yeah. He's name is Eric and he's handsome and smart. He's got a good job. What else could I ask for? Not much. I mean. No less than I could offer you. Excuse me? I'm just saying, he sounds like a catch. And so am I. Of course you are. You're amazing. You'll meet someone - eventually. I've got to go the men's room. I'll be right back. Why don't you order for me? What are you having? Same as you. Aleksander, what are you doing?! What do you think I'm doing? What the hell! I offered myself to you and you rejected me! What's wrong with you?! This is going to be the best blow job you ever got. No! No Aleksander! What the hell is wrong with you?! You can't keep behaving like this! Everybody wants to fuck me and so do you! No Aleksander, everyone wants to buy you. Not everybody wants you. You see, I did want you because I thought I knew you. But this? Oh you feel left out? You see I'm doing well. That I met someone. And now you want to sleep with me?! That's low; even for you. Oh my god no! Yes! You try to control it all Aleksander. You just can't! I just realized, I realized that I love you! I love you! Oh please. Come on! You just disappointed me more than anyone. I mean it! Please believe me! Goodbye, Aleksander. Tom! Goodbye! Tom! - Here. - Thank you. Keith sent me a text message. He said he knew of a sex party and that I should go. I really didn't want to do it, but I asked how much they were going to pay and I decided to go. I was going to have sex with women as well for the first time. Get pretty. Have a seat. Take a drink. It'll keep your bone strong. More. Drink my bitch. More. More. [man laughs] Lick. No. Suck it. More! That's it. That's it. That's exactly right. Yes! Beautiful. More. [auditory hallucination of laughter] Thanks for coming. My pleasure. Get yourself comfortable. Take down your jacket. I'll make a drink for us. You're making me feel young again! Let me get you undressed. Yeah. Yeah. Pull my hair! Are you leaving already? Yeah. I don't stay over. Not with clients. I had a great time. Yeah. Me too. Oh, you can take $500 from my wallet right there. I just take that on my way from work. Nikolay Ivanov. My father. Sacha! [violent crying] Aleksander! Stop this this instant! You're not well! Stop it! OK. I'm going to leave the room and when I'm back, you better have stopped it or I'm going to have you removed from my office! Aleksander? You did the right thing by coming here. I will help you get though this. [sobbing] For the coming months, I started to see a psychiatrist. It was very helpful and so was Dr. Mary. The 2 of them showed me ways to be happy. They helped me find the good in me. I have so many qualities that I didn't even know I had. I moved out of my old apartment to a better area. And I started to work at a different place. A job where people appreciated me for who I am not for what I do. Getting clean both from drugs and sex; it's a daily battle. I got tempted so many times, but I didn't know if I would fall for it again. Would I fall for it again? Oooh [female voice]
