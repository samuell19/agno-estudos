I think it did a great job. - Olivia. - Are we going to talk about it at some point, or are you just going to pretend nothing happened yesterday? - What happened yesterday? - Jack are you kidding me? Didn't you notice what happened last night with your mother? - Last night we went to dinner. - I'm sorry, can you please close the book, and stop reading and pay attention to me, is that too much to ask? Please? Oh thank you. - Right. What's the matter? - Are you really, I mean are you kidding me, or did you realize what happened last night? There was something really wrong about your mother. - What happened last night, we had dinner with my mother and we came home, what, what's wrong? - Yeah and I have found out that you've been keeping things from me, alongside your mother. - I've been keeping things from you? - Yes. - Olivia, what are you talking about? - I don't care that she lies to you, or that she lies to me, but when it comes to you lying to me, it's a whole different matter Jack. - Oh my goodness, so we went for supper, we come back, we go to sleep, we wake up and now my mother lies to you, I lie to you? - I don't care about your mum. - What are you talking about? - I care about that lie about her and you lie to me. - No ones lying to anyone. - Of course, yes. She's been keeping things from you, have you noticed at least? - No. Okay fine, I mean last night, well she was off. - Thank you. - She was off a little bit, but everyone's off. - A little bit? - You and your mother are off sometimes. - I'm sorry, I'm the psychologist here, I can see right through her. - Well done, what do you see then, what's there to see? - There's something serious that she's keeping from you Jack. You have to make her tell the truth, you know that? And you cannot keep things from me, you know we're married here. - Okay, I know we're married. - Then let's start acting like you are. I can't accept this Jack, you know? - Fine, fine. I will go later today and I'll talk to her and ask her what's up. - Thank you, you will go, thank you so much for considering me, you know we're just a couple. - We will go. - Fuck off! - We will go, we will go, later. - Thank you, thank you. - Okay. Olivia, look, we can go together as a couple and find out what's wrong with her, the truth and whatever you see. - Whatever I see? - We can go together as a couple, we can go after lunch. Please, you're right, I wouldn't want anything to come between us. Please? We can go after lunch. My dear? Monkey? Yeah? A little smile? - No. - No monkey smile? - No. - We go after lunch? - Yeah. - Yes. Okay, come on. It's fine, let's have some breakfast, come on. It's so cute, have you seen it?

My name's Jack. - We know who you are. - Jack don't forget, we are lawyers, we're a different breed of intellect. It's our privilege to lie. The problem is that, she did it. The problem is that, she did it. It's our privilege to lie. It's our privilege to lie. The problem is that, she did it. Jack. Jack. It's our privilege to lie. It's our privilege to lie. The problem is that, she did it. Jack. The problem is that. The problem, the problem is that, she did it. The problem is that, she did it. - Mr. Casey. Do you have a moment please? - Yes, sure. - Detective Michael Berelli. I'm searching for Olivia Bailey. - Yes, that's me. What's the problem detective? Is there a problem, what's going on? - My office has received a complaint about your practice. I need to ask you a few questions. - Detective I think there's been some kind of mistake. My wife is a professional. - Sir, calm down. This is just an investigation. No one has been accused of anything yet. - It's okay. How can I help you detective. We're sorry, this is just out of the ordinary for us. - I understand. I'm sure we can get to the bottom of this. We have a couple complaints from a man who say you are their therapist. They say you met with some of them, and they say you were asking them to do things that are uncomfortable, and unusual. - Unusual? I deal with people who are psychologically unstable. I have to analyze if they can fit into society so that they do not kill or become a menace to this country. - And? - That should help you from having to investigate a real crime. - Then you shouldn't have problem with taking a detection test at out office if we need it. - Mr. Berelli, I think you should check your sources. My wife and I are late for lunch, good day. - I will be in contact. Thank you for your time. - Are you guys all right? - Of course. Actually, Olivia and I came here to talk to you about something. We both feel that there's something you're not telling us mother, and now is the time to get things out in the open and be honest. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Yesterday evening, at dinner, Olivia felt, we felt, that you were hiding something from us. - Was this your idea? - Seriously? Sorry? - Yesterday was so clear that you were lying to us. And you know what? I don't care only this is affecting out marriage because he started to lie, he lied to me and I'm not gonna let it. May it's just a misunderstanding. - I'm not gonna allow it. There's no point shouting about it. - What are you talking about? - Guys, guys, guys. - You know what? I don't care if you don't want to tell me. But to talk to him and tell him the truth. - Mother, what she's trying to say is that I think it's time to be honest. - Or what? - Or you'll be seeing a lot less of me. And her, and us. - You know there are things that are better not to be said or known. I don't think you'll like me anymore. - Mother it's not about whether I like you any more or less, I'm your son, I'll always love you. It's just about telling the truth. Look I understand if you don't want to tell Olivia, it's your choice, it's your choice, but you can tell me. Would it make it easier if I came back later? Yeah? Okay, let's do that, okay? Okay. Cold. - Yeah. - See you soon again. - Bye, thank you. - Bye. Bye mom, see well. - Yeah, listen I, Jack and Olivia were here yesterday and. I don't know, Olivia doesn't seem too well. You know, we've had our differences and I'm probably not the easiest, but I still want him to be happy, so I thought it would be good if you had a mother daughter talk with her. I don't know, distraught, and I know somethings not right. What does that mean? Enough! Listen, we cannot tell them anything. We know that in this world you need to have assets and without them, we are nothing. Okay. Just whatever you do, do not tell them anything. Okay, okay bye. - Goodbye Grace. - Am I willing to sacrifice my son for riches? - Dad? When I went in last night, I felt something really bad. And I felt lost. I know. I know. Stop it, it pains me day and night. Stop it! Stop it. I don't know what you're talking about, - I'm checking on the case. No, I'll call you later. So their parents. Very interesting. Berelli here, yeah? Have you heard about Madison Plures case? Oh. Really? Thanks, yeah. Kill. Kill. Kill. - How can I help you sir? - Detective Michael Berelli. Can I come in? - Yes of course, please. - I'm investigating on a case which involves your sons wife. - Okay, what is it? - My office ask me to investigate on an unconventional practice. - She is the best therapist in Europe, you don't know what you're talking about. She's a diamond in this horrible world. - I understand, but I still must do my job, so I have a question for you. Do you know anything about a 1978 death of Ms. Madison Plures? - I don't know what your talking about. Is this about my daughter in law? - No, I have to follow up on all leads that can be related to our case. - I understand but I really have to go back to work. Would you mind to leave now detective? I'm sorry. - Certainly. But I'm gonna be back if I find that you are lying very soon. - Are you okay? Yeah, did you sleep well? - Yeah. - There was no bread left. It's all right. - Grace. - Excuse me? - I know what you did. - Stop harassing me. - I've got your number Grace! I don't know how long I can go on like this. - If you don't say the truth now you will lose everything. - What about Jack? What about my son? You see what is happening. I feel he's suffering because of me, because of what I did. - You have to choose now. - Where is it, where is it? Come on, come on, yes. Little bit, little bit, little bit.

Okay, okay, well come quick. - I love you. Bye. Olivia! Olivia! Olivia! Olivia! - Grace, you have to tell the truth now. - I can't. I just can't. - Olivia! - Olivia! - Olivia! - Olivia! - Hello Hello, I'm an abuse therapist. I can offer you my services, I can help you feel better. - Olivia! Olivia! Olivia, Olivia.

Hey. - So whatever you wanna tell me, tell me. Come on. I'm listening. - You know we weren't always rich. We were poor common people. I befriended an old lady who was very rich and I took care of her estate because I was intelligent and great with numbers. So I took care of her estate and she trusted me with her life. Only I got greedy. And I wanted more power and more money. So I agreed with the family that we would find a way to kill her. And they would set an agreement that I would get a percentage of the estate worth millions if I participated. I couldn't follow through, but her family did. I tried to back out of the agreement because I believe it's wrong but they didn't let me. Instead they killed her and placed her body into a red suitcase. This is really hard, but I had no idea they would blackmail me. They put the suitcase under the house when I wasn't home. I couldn't report it to the police because they would have arrested me as an accomplice to the crime. And every time I approached the suitcase to dump it into the sea, a demon appeared that threatened to kill you and everybody near to me. Anyways about a month later I went to the bank and there were 75 million euros deposited into my account. And I took it. I'm so sorry. - Sorry? All of this and you're sorry? Mother, get that suitcase out of this house. Do you understand what it's doing to me! Tell the police, tell the truth, it's ruining my life! If that suit case and you are not out of this house tomorrow night, I will take to to the station myself! Do you understand? Get rid of it! - Stop it, stop. God, God help me. God, please help me. I can't do this anymore, I can't do this. She's running, she's running. - Oh Jack you made it, look at you know, look at you now, you've done it! Well done you, well done you. Mr. Vanderbilt, Mr. Vanderbilt, Mr. Vanderbilt. Hello Mr. Vanderbilt, lovely to see you Mr. Vanderbilt. You want, you want, I can have your money? Look at you Jack, you've done it. They've lied. They've lied. Olivia. They lied to us! She lied to us! My own mother. My own mother! - You were so close. Yeah, yeah, Chris was telling me. - Jack, Jack. Can I talk to you for a second? - Sure, what's up? - Be careful. - The world is yours, take whatever you want. - Jack, a lie is not a lie. - Jack, always tell the truth. - We know what you want, so just take it. - God is always watching, and listening. - Jack can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah, one sec, sorry. What's up? - Jack don't forget. We as lawyers, we're a different breed of intellect. It's our privilege to lie. Now you have these people fooled, but I know who you really are. Do you want to go outside and take some of this nervousness away? - Sure, yeah, I'm in. - Olivia. - Where is mom? - She's in there. - Darling? Are you okay? I need to talk to you. - What's wrong, Olivia? Right now? Can you please. - I can't, not right this moment darling, I can't talk right now. Actually you can, this is what we're gonna do and you're gonna tell me the truth so. - Darling even if I-- - This time we're doing my way. - This is neither the time nor the place. - Mum, you're not-- - I've heard enough, you know what? Olivia please, please. Please understand. - I'm sorry, we came here for answers and now you're telling me you don't even wanna talk right now? I don't want to talk. - I cannot go on like this, we don't know what we're going through. I can't go on like this. - You have no idea, you have no idea. Your father and I, we became rich when we were young. We were poor, we didn't know how we would survive. - Mum, you are stalling! Please! - I don't give a shit about this! Okay, okay, you want me to tell you, you want me to tell you? - Yes, yes, I know that something else is causing this, I need to know it now. - Okay, you want the truth, okay. Okay. During the 1990s your father and I met a gentleman at a nightclub we used to go to to connect with rich people. We were seeking opportunities and these gentlemen, they liked out company, and they liked our style, didn't they Kevin? So he introduced us to prostitution and how to run a brothel. This man, he gave us, he gave us a brothel. And the house, this house, it had many women. And the man who gave us the house, he started to. He started to send underage girls because men, men would pay so much money for them. We didn't like it. But he insisted, he threatened to kick us out if we didn't go along with it. So we agreed. And after years of this life style, and many of these young women, they ended up with psychological problems which they took with them into their adult life. - But in the end, I'd had enough. And I insisted that these girls should go home. And we shut the house down. We closed the brothel. - I knew there was something else, now I see why. Now I see why I've been acting, why I've been feeling so promiscuous. - Darling can't you just understand? Just please, understand. The reason we have so much, the reason we have everything. We bought many properties and we became successful real estate owners. We stopped the prostitution. - The house is, the house is still there. What do you mean, it's still there? - It's abandoned. But it's, it's still alive. - Oh my God. That's why this is happening. That's why this is happening, we have to burn the house down. That's why I'm going through all this. And you didn't think we had to burn it down? We have to burn it down, we have to burn it down. I'm gonna burn it down, don't touch me! - Greetings all. It is great to have you, may peace be with you. You know in life you have the choices. You can tell the truth or you can lie. You can believe the curse, or you cannot believe the curse. But in end it will be your decision in life to make the right choice. Life is not promised with anything you desire or want. But the one thing you do have is your choices. May the Lord be with you, amen. - Well Grace, you get to come with me. We have more evidence on the case. Okay Grace, are you ready to tell the truth now? Jack, I'm just gonna take a shower. - Okay. My darling Jack. By the time you read this letter, I will have left Sorrento. I could not bring myself to say these words in person to you. These are the hardest words that I have ever written. Now that you have heard what I had done. You know, everything that I am. Jack you'll never knew how sorry I am but I need you to be strong. The suitcase is in the closet and the key is underneath my bed. Now, you know where it is and the lies it contains. What you do with this information is up to you my love. No one else knows. This is now you're choice. I know I'm not perfect. And I know I have failed you. One day I pray that I will be forgiven but for now, I have told you the truth and that is all I can do.
