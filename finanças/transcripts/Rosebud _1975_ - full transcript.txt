Glad you're here. - Why? Is there anything? It's boring here. Is a year holiday in Corsica so boring? - I love action. That'll be fine. We leave tomorrow morning. I knew. I said he came out this week. He says every week, al- ls magazine ready? Come on. Adrian, how are you? Hacam, for the first time in Algeria. - That's fifteen years ago. Madam, you are not so good? - She talks to no one. Is everything else okay? In the house, and the farm? Your friends take good care. - Nice. We'll talk later. Hopefully you some snaps on. What happened to them? He has recently had a car accident. He?? had three boys with him. An idiot drove them. Tardets could get out, but children perished by fire. When they brought here... the charred corpses... ...she was completely hysterical. Yelling, screaming. We have her tied to the bed. She went four days and nights. And then she stopped suddenly. Since then, she says nothing. And he just sits there? - The whole day. Guilt, I think. Sad, but fortunately he is unharmed. The farm must to his name for our plan. Why I put day and night someone with him. Let the basement look at. - I shows a lot more to see. While you stole planes and the front pulled in Germany... I worked hard. This I put the security of the door. Take something of your own format. - Very funny. Help with me. Two hundred years ago hewn out of the rock. Ideal for us. I have lightly built. This is the armory. Russian AK-4's. Are they good? - If you like firearms. Try you still make the ideal weapon? I've already made it. Who do you use for years. This non-. The last was wider. That hurt. It works right? What the heck. - I'm getting nauseous. Murder people, okay. But I want to hurt them. Look. Perfect. I want to try.'M out. Here is another basement. Where does the air come from? - I have found four shafts. And if someone is crying? - That's no problem. And water and toilets? There is water from the kitchen, but toilets need it the old fashioned way. Buckets? - Even I can not control everything. Simply delightful, Mom. Beautiful long legs of a dancer. The dancers I know had hideous legs. And so ' a beautiful sight. - That's different. When I get back from Greece, we go from here back to London. This should not you? - Go ahead. Who have you agreed in Rome? - With friends. Some do not know you. Like? Who then? A handsome Italian? Margareth, what would your father say? He would say, Helene, here in Berkshire we tolerate ge and handsome Italians. She's not here now. - Patrice Thibaud. He is a friend of Sabine. Joyce Donnovan. How do you know me? A-flutter. Sabine and Helene errands. We're going to cook for Sabine's grandfather. Is Fargeau here? - Not yet. He'll eat later. Can you get it out? - I know him not, and I want to keep it that way. Lettuce, pate, meat, bread... I think we forgot something. - There is still nothing more. That lndian blouse though. - You already have four of it. Butter. We forgot the butter. - No, I'm here. Where have you been? - We are going camping in Sweden. Put?? this briefly in the galley. Sweetheart. Hey, guy. You might come yesterday. - I could not leave. Who's going? - Margaret Carter, Joyce Donnovan... And Gertrude Freyer. If you together ' n cartel forms, can you buy the whole world. German banking, British shipbuilding, U.S. politics and steel. And you eyeball, Fargeau Enterprises. But poor Helene has nothing. If you were not so busy with Sabine, , you did what I had. Come on, we have to cook. - Start making. I'll come. Do you dare lay odds, Patrice? There lies the Rosebud. Strange name for a boat. Could Fargeau nothing better than that? It had something to do with a movie. - You call from any port. No buts. You call out each port. I'm two weeks at The Hassler in Rome and then home. I'm going. Kiss. I'm calling from Athens. - Earlier. I will. Do not worry. For a firearm enthusiast you shoot bad. Quickly, the money. As we have seen together... - Quiet. Arise tonight you waiting for? What we do with that boy? - They're not coming, they said. We do not feel crowded. If he's not gone for two hours, , just enter the character. I light a cigarette. My first and only of that night. Here, half your money. The rest comes tonight. Do you have any salad. - I do not like salad. Do it anyway. We remain more than one day in Sicily. You do not know whether there is McKinley. Yes. I had a card from him. He's with a group of Princeton excavations at Catania. He was talking about lewd mosaics. - Princeton, yuck. If you knew that your mom with your teacher... If they knew McKinley, she was there before me. Maybe I'll stay longer in Sicily. Consider the appointment. - Do not drop out. Never. - Whiners. I've made a decision. You keep eating. - Oh, no. I'm here for you. Not to eat with that reactionary bag. - He's not a bag. He ' n grandfather. You need at acquainted. I borrow a clean shirt captain. - I've got a shirt. And I do not eat it. How are your parents? - Good. Dad comes from the Senate soon. Is he president? - M ' My mom hates Washington. Thank you. They go back to live in Paris? Your mom parties were famous. There is m ' a sweet girl. - Come on, the meat shortly. Grandpa, this is Patrice Thibaud. He?? would like to meet. Patrice, finally. - How do you do? Nothing. - Keep looking. It's still early. What was your name again, Patrice? - I am a lecturer at Vincennes. Oh yes, I believe that a senior accountant of mine studied there. Cigarette? What do you give? - Political Economy. I might be a stupid... Currently we deal with the negative effects of economic powers... ...as you... ...on the integrity of the government. - Negative effect, you say? Where are the strawberries? - Sit down, you're probably tired of it cooking. The larger a conglomerate like yours, how harmful it is. Without businesses, there is no work and collapsed society together. I have nothing against companies, but against... ...the wealthy elite that controls them. Oh, so that's it. Delicious. If people are exploited long enough revolution is the only way out. When all revolutionaries in their energy work tasks, was' n revolution unnecessary. Your defense is quite predictable. - And your attack is extremely naive. Sorry it was just as seriously. Is there champagne? Yes, though. I hit the champagne over. Just rude. Just like that redhead Labour lazy. Patrice not go well pissed off. I'm not angry. I do not. Belong here. I want to talk to you. - What? You're at z ' n money tied. He buys you as he buys anything. What should I do? - Go during the journey to find yourself. Do not you love me? Is he gone? I should get going. Nice kid. - Like ' m nice? You think ' m kind. Maybe I 'can to get at the Sorbonne. That seems better. Goodbye, sweetheart. Day, Grandpa. Captain? Everything okay? - No problems. Caution. You have a precious cargo. There he goes. It will not be long. Okay, come on. Here's the rest of your money. You save me now unconscious? - Then no one knows you participated. Relax, you feel nothing of it. It works perfectly. Where sleeps the crew? - There. Casting off. You are a prisoner of the Palestinian Liberation Army. Do what we say. Arise. How to get here? - Top. Come on. And that drape loosely. Come on. Over here. Come on, move it. Okay, in a row of chairs. Who is Helene Nikolaos? I am. Attention, there sails a ship direction Acco. Current position: 32 degrees north... ...34 degrees 25 minutes east longitude. - Send a reconnaissance unit. Central command post for WA 291. Here WA 291 You tell me. Research vessel unknown between Tel Aviv and Acco. Command Post here WA 291 - Shoot.. This is a yacht, named Rosebud. No visible activity, and no response to request identification. We'll send a patrol boat. Colonel Avivi, please. Rush. Damn. 2-1 in sets for me. At last I'm going to win again. It's not time yet. A good diplomat let z ' Win a supervisor. That's what you think. - But then unwillingly. Come on, Colonel. Colonel Avivi phone. That's what you settled Hamlekh. He's not responding. - Really. What are you doing? He's slowing down, it seems. You did it. We'll see if anyone is. We found seven dead. Let the rest of the ship to search. You go into a truck. - What is this game? It's not a game. My grandfather pay for what you want. Please let us go. You are blindfolded, like when you went to the Rosebud. I should point out that if you see anything what we're trying to keep secret... ...we have to murder you. Based on autopilot we know that the ship is leaving here... ...and had to come around here. - How? Simple, they carry a compass course in in the system and it does the rest. How accurate is that? - Very much. The computer takes into changing winds and currents. The timer is not set, so we know no time. So they can sit in Egypt, Libya or T unesi?. Everywhere. Newsweek. With Martin. Martin, what are you doing? - Lunch. 1 To 0.40 am? And my article? - Here. As always: Short, British, and it will not be posted. Newsweek dependance. Wait. That does not sound like me. Give it to Nick. Right. If Mr. Fargeau asks me, it seems nothing for me. He insists? I still work for the U.S.? Or has he bought too? Only Foreign Affairs? Good. When you bring the file along? No, I only talk to ' m when I read it.' Then he waits a moment. If you do not like him... ...send Nick only. Mr. Martin? Mr. Fargeau you expected. Where were you? I sit all day waiting for? Sit down. Do you want anything? - A ham sandwich. With some mustard. Quick, we're in a hurry. And a glass of milk would be nice. There is a letter from the kidnappers. My granddaughter and four friends are in the hands of Black September. You need to get through your contacts her free. My contacts with Black September? - Like that Lufthansa hijacking. Mr. Fargeau, I'm a British correspondent for Newsweek. You can stop this nonsense. I know everything about you. Really. You are a British mercenary employed by the United States. On October 3, 1972... ...decided to dump the last three terrorists 't Olympic massacre. Their presence in a German cell could lead to a new attack. On October 5, Lawrence Martin of the CIA, was that you... ...informed by Hans Schloss of the BND. Could the German secret service is not refurbishing it yourself? German agents had to remain aloof, because of lsrael air could get... ...a scandal caused. On October 20, you flown to Beirut and... Go. It's fascinating. On October 20, you had a conversation with in Beirut Black September. On 28 October did you like purser... ...boarded the Lufthansa unit during maintenance... ...hid two grenades and two pistols in the toilet. The 29th hijacked two Arabs' t phone and demanded the release of terrorists. You guided the terrorists M ?nchen Zagreb... ...to exchange for the passengers of the hijacked airliner them. Nice story, but it's not true. Although I was in Zagreb and was m ' n article even posted. Stop playing games, Martin. Hesitate to call yourself correspondent, but you work for me now, error. Maybe I can help you, but work for you... Never. Let me see that letter. - All right. There was a film in which is now being edited. I let him in five minutes to the family show. I'll see you again. Oh, by the way: Are there more Jewish girls at? I think not. But how do you know it from me? I had destroyed my papers for the Nazis. No, not everything. I have a found when you were waiting for me. You later. My name is Helene Nikolaos. My girlfriends, Sabine Fargeau... Margaret Carter... Joyce Donnovan... Gertrude Freyer... ...and I... ...are prisoners Palestinian Liberation Army... One of us will be released if this movie is broadcast... ...on all major TV channels in France, Germany, England and America... ...on same day at eight o'clock in the evening. If the film is edited or not broadcast in one of the countries... ...one of us will be executed... ...and the dead body in her parents home delivery. But if the film is shown as asked the girl released will... ...meekrijgen a film with further instructions. Any attempt to find or liberate us... our location... ...will lead to our immediate execution. You will understand how scared we are. Help us, please. How did such a thing could ever happen? But how much ransom they ask, I pay it. All I'm dead broke. We have to stay rational. Martin, what do you suggest? That you first determine whether you respond to their demands. Admit I think is unwise. I was in Kenya when the Mau Mau was active. A group of hostage family Governor in z ' n house. They would release them if he surrendered. Against my advice he did. The next day hung his head to the balcony. Besides that z ' a wife and children. Fine story now come along. - And this situation is different. It is the Palestinians to the public... ...opinion. They want to have the movie on TV. I give these animals also prefer their sense not. But we have no choice. We set a date. Today is Tuesday, right? Friday then? Each of us makes it's in z ' s own country is on TV. I'm going straight to the prime minister. - Anything else? Well, good luck all. France, England and Germany have aired. Idiots. Stupid idiots. - The U.S. is still there. Why would they 't do? - Do not be so negative. Ambassador in Washington. He always Boils? I can not at the stove. - And I avoid the sink. Mr. Martin, what do you think? - Melina, you promised. Do you mind talking about it? We have to wait until the first one is free. Are not you afraid that America is not broadcasting? Why would not they? Donnovan has permission from the FCC. Anyway, within two hours we know it. I take ' m so. They never learn. The king was toppled we had to rush out of Greece. I said, 'We're going to Paris.' But she said ' That's too expensive.' But we are gone, I found work and a nice apartment. Eat Well. That's why I'm talking to you, what you eat so. This is my special dessert. Eat al-l. It is really delicious. A summer came Sabine Helene. Her parents were dead. She did not back the whole holiday to her grandfather, without boyfriends. We loved it. As if we had a daughter with. A few days later Fargeau me early to get a drink. He?? liked it so much that Sabine had with us. And he gave me the key of this apartment. Without any cost or obligation. Do you understand why I was not worried? Here I am, a poor Greek exile, like God in France... ...anywhere and I never made me worry about one day. Except... ...my two daughters. That was Fargeau. There is something in the U.S., we must come immediately. What is it? - Donnovan called. The ambassador lsraeli is urgent meeting with the president. What does that mean? That lsrael want to block the broadcast. Yeah, hold on. I'm putting you on speaker. Donnovan. Go ahead. Do you hear me? Yes, what happened? I do not know what happened, but ambassador declared: ' I've had a good conversation with the president. He also found that the U.S. should not be blackmailed by terrorists... ...regardless of the consequences.' End of quote. So he said the president not support broadcast state. He said. - But Senator... ...everything was still around? There was approval from the FCC. Day, Mr. Nikolaos. The FCC apparently wanted only gauge how... ...the stations were thinking about naked. I try the press secretary of the President to speak. Go talk to the president himself. - He wants to see me until Monday. Too much pressure from the other side. But then it's too late. I'll call when I know something. Do not cry, honey. The president's deliberation in his Oval Office to and weigh what to do. Approval cost him Jewish support. A ban will cost him the support of all mothers in the country. The numbers are in your favor. There are mothers. I have to make of the commentary on the BBC recording... ...after the film. We can now see it. The situation is that the three European countries have the film screened... ...and the U.S. that eight hours would have to follow suit. From Beirut reported that PLO leader Yasser Arafat... ...has denied any involvement in the kidnapping. On BBC 2's go to 22.30 further Newsroom on the matter. This was Jules Pettifer. The regular program will resume. Is there something in the newspaper? - Two comments for, one against. O Lord Carter. Good evening Yes, there is a problem in America. Wait, I get another call. Wait, I'll put you on speaker. - You hear me? The president remains aloof. The TV stations are private companies. He can blackmail message not stop. So it is broadcast. Guard, the interrupt channels broadcast. I love the phone with the TV. The life of an innocent girl lies in the hands of the three major channels. The managements speak their disapproval about the way the kidnappers. But life must always priority. Therefore, we will broadcast the movie as required. They're going to do it. He?? is now broadcast. Thank God. Lord Carter, he's on TV. Call Freyer for me? Thanks. Do you want to continue to sweep? - Seven times but. Terrible. We must do something. We are so weak by those tranquilizers. Wipe well but. It's your turn. - Waste of time. I'd kill for a nail file. This is not to. We can Kirkbane hostage when he brings the food. He immediately cut your throat. Sabine, come at his feet. We play chess. - She had to spit yesterday. From that eating a goat would have puke. Would we out of here alive? - We would not want to talk about. Do you do hard again? - Do I sometimes find it good? Take it to. There'll calm you down. You get nothing. You have to wake continue on the way home. Do not give up. You're stronger than you think. You always have luck. - She can not help it. Now you have it on. Before you leave, we make a movie. This is your text. Ready? Reading. The Palestine Liberation Organization is pleased... ...that the film has been screened so fast. Today I am released. This was the first part of your journey. You are now going by plane. On the other hand, you will be waiting. Okay? Careful. I leave you here. Barn with the rope over the edge. Then you can free yourself. Follow the path back to the road and try to get a ride there. Success. What are you doing here alone? - Can you take me to the police? Where are we? - We'll be in lle-Rousse. Where is that? - Corsica. Thank you very much. - Welcome. It is at the corner. To escape, you must first press the continue a time in my house. What do we tell them? - They had to recover first. Say, how did you brought to Corsica? - With a small plane. I was blindfolded, but I he had two engines. The were off and landing on rough terrain. Are they seen on the radar? No, but that says nothing. Smugglers come along too. - Continue. After landing took a man with a nice voice me into a van. Oh yeah, when they took me out of the basement... - What basement? Forget it, I will. About the second film... - I was just telling. It's a short film, but then you must read on television. Ask your parents to pack some clothes I let them pick. They bring 'em. - With the press there. I want to see. - And I want to talk to you. Later you can see them, now you can call. What are you doing? If I want to leave, you can not stop me. And do I have to sleep sometimes? With you? Well, if you insist... Withers. - That was not meant seriously. Sorry. I realize what you've been through, but you have to tell me everything. The life of your girlfriends depends. Call your parents, then we begin. What the sleeping accommodation is concerned... Thibaud, let me see your ID. Sorry, certainly in my other clothes. I had such a rush when I heard that you wanted to see me. I understand that the party wants that you hate the police... ...but we're trying to save your girlfriend. I would think that you do want to help. In your mind you might just tie your shoes. If you do not have a warrant, I go again. Sit. You are going to pass away when we say it. Get off me. - I judge of that. Stop. Idiots. What are you doing? Look. He started -. Who believes that? I can see the headlines now: 'Activists leader beaten up by police.' And then the head with it. God almighty. Get a doctor quickly. Let ' m Make a list of trusted chiefs. He needs every 24 hours' n other command be detained until it's patched. And that could take weeks. Yes, Mr. Fargeau. I'm working on it. After this film Charles-Andr? Fargeau should... ...on TV to admit his part in the massacre of innocent Palestinians... ...by King Hussein in September 1970, Black September. After this statement is one of my friends released... ...with a new film with further instructions. Otherwise, the new film delivered to her parents... ...her lifeless body. My name is Charles-Andr? Fargeau. In June 1970, King Hussein had... ...and Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian refugees... ...almost an agreement reached on peaceful coexistence. I then reported the king I, despite the arms embargo... ...could deliver to eradicate all. Palestinians in Jordan have enough weapons. I did mainly for profit. Hussein agreed. When the crew of the cargo refused... Aquitain. I'm the captain and crew my yacht Rosebud bribed... ...to Aquitain to Al-Aqabah to sail... ...where the weapons were transferred to Hussein's Bedouin army. I accept full responsibility for the massacre... ...whereby all Palestinian families have been killed... ...become known as Black September... And for the death of my crew, charged with complicity is slain. I must also confess that I long for many years... ...concealed that I am Jewish. Helene, I just want to talk to Martin. - I can not go anywhere. Go a bath. - Good idea. Black September is led by an Englishman Edward Sloat. He's behind all recent actions, except around the Olympic terrorists. I was, and you knew that. After he graduated from Cambridge, he was n scholarship Iraq. He?? would return to teach after a year... ...but was instead advisor of the royal family. He was a Muslim, went to Mecca and called himself Hadji Asham Sloat. And z ' n link with Black September? - The massacre at the airport Lod. Sloat paid a Japanese leftist movement for $ 750,000. It had to be a suicide mission. The terrorists were given a dose of cyanide that was released after a certain time. Besides the terrorist who has told you? He was not dead. We were just in time z ' n stomach pumped. How did Sloat that money? - Through Switzerland. A cunning ploy. A: The Communist Revolution in Iraq. All wealthy families were slain. Two: Their power was deposited in Swiss bank accounts. Three: Sloat has worked at a Swiss bank. He let Arab accomplices as next of kin to claim the money. Could they identify themselves? They said their papers were destroyed , what their witnesses confirmed. How has he won? Estimated Crude? $ 500 million? - Good grief. This is a project of him. Arab war comics. - The hero is different in each country. Algerian Algerian, Egyptian in Egypt... But the villain remains a jew. Semitism is widespread. Strips are harmless. But not Sloat. He is ruthless, organized and smart. Why are you telling me this? The strips are made by a comics publisher in Hamburg. A courier delivers them to Sloat. You might be able to follow the courier. - Can you do that yourself? The Germans do not work with it. They prefer to let terrorists free than they catch them. But you are they required anything. But you are they required anything. Not bad, but I'm prettier. I see you too little for a good portrait. There's a collaborator. I guessed it already, but now I know. What are you talking about? - Empty your pockets. Empty pockets, or I will. Tiran. I've fifteen bars one afternoon eaten. Without spitting. Thank you very much. What a dirty trick. - You walk to suck those bastards. I suppose you'll have to put them to bed. No, they do not. It's not fair. Messages for passengers. How are you, Hans? - Good. Now I can help you. Again. Nice. Took it difficult to 'settle? T. - For you? No, since that trick with the hijacking you our secret national hero. All this for an observation job? German thoroughness. We can not look because the curtains are always closed in the studio. This microphone from send us a signal of their door here. Hence they are within 30 seconds outside. So who leave the premises within that time, is suspect. And after closing? - Then we follow all the first five employees. The suspect is just the studio. There you 'have m. Look, here. It is a well-oiled machine. - Nice, huh? And now we wait. That's one way. - Wait. Follow suspect, around 40, 1.82 meters, light raincoat, black portfolio. He runs the Binder Strasse. Let them walk. The suspect got into a white taxi. Northward on Mittelweg. Registration HH-WZ-627. There he goes. Flights to Berlin 608 leaving in half an hour. Two tickets for the same flight. - It's full. The 220 is still room. No, this flight. I can put you on the waiting list. - I have a reservation. You Excuse me... Miss Edgeworth. Through computer- problems, your flight is overbooked. We had booked for weeks. Yes, but you can join with flight 220. And to sweeten the wait we offer a champagne lunch. If you take the ticket and baggage... I will accompany these charming ladies to the restaurant. Schmitt, so beautiful. Can I join? - We'll call you when we need you. He sends the voucher to someone who completes the order. Can I help you? - A man has issued sketches. I want to know what you do for him. - Excluded. I am the police. - You will be with ' n order to come. I have another official document. - Get out. Right now. T rut. You again? - Grete Muller. Which is present? This is in school. - Girls 14 sitting there now mostly. What do you want from Grete? - We want to ask her something. About her working here. - Why? On your door that you close at six. - But it was not until ten o'clock. After-hours, we eat together. - Late dinners. Sounds familiar, huh? - Very. You ate with your previous assistant. - In bed, she said. That charge was withdrawn. You can not touch me. Grete's parents may be less forgiving. What do you want to know? - The man with the portfolio. He brings weekly drawings and we make slides. When are they ready? - Tomorrow at five. Who gets them? Who comes here with the coupon. We are waiting in a car outside the door. When issuing the slides, giving you a sign. And when they see that, then hang up. If I do what you ask, leave me alone? Out. I get sick of you. You are leaving the American sector. We do not go. Only Germans allowed alongside. Go on. - On which side they shoot me down. The bastards. Thibaud, come with me. - Leave me alone. They let you go. - With this face? That they do not dare. What's behind it? - Nothing. You're free, get out. If you are engaged to Sabine Fargeau? - I'm engaged to her. What do you know about the kidnapping? - What happened to your face? What will you do? - I've been soaking in cells full of lice. I have to go to the doctor. Tomorrow I will give a press conference. I have to go. Larry, how are you? State Thibaud in the newspaper? On the front page. A friend will bring you a slide. Do ' m at Kobis Pictorial with the mission of Sloat. You'd leave me alone. - When I'm done, I'll leave you alone. Do you still prepared drawings? - Maybe. Where is the package? Specify. You forget that I have been. And do not look. I wait outside to keep. Watching you. Helene Did you achieved? - Yeah, come on. You need help with the Rosebud case. - I do not know anything. I know. Why I've gotten pretty. Was that your work? Yes, and all those people too. I know who is behind the kidnapping. If the press your ideas exposed... ...he might want to talk to you. And this morning came the invitation. And I'm in your place. You stay here and you take phone until my return. You're a cop, huh? - Something like that. Then you're doubly wrong. I hate the police and support the Palestinians. Now get out. I ask you to help me save Sabine. How long should I stay here? - There is enough food for two weeks. And you trust me to stay here. - Course. You are a special policeman. Very well. Have z ' completed a phone? He would cooperate, so he does keep a low profile. Get out and undress. Do not worry, I'm with you. This time you will succeed. Do your makeup and see, Martin. It is probably not good. No, not really. Thank you. What was that all about? Sit down. You mean execution? Curious execution. He?? had you can shoot. He was one of m ' s best men. - But now he is dead. He had survived a suicide attack. - I do not understand. Who run a suicide mission, is dead. He's ready. That's the way to go. Survivors I can not deal with. Go get coffee. I know since Lod Airport. Well, what did you tell me? Public opinion is on your hand. The lsra?li?rs are willing to consult. I can arrange an interview. Public opinion can be so flip. If the world 2.5 million Jews are more important than three girls... You lose. Want some coffee? When you release the girls, you give Palestinians what they want: Negotiations with lsrael. - Maybe. But I do not want that. I want the destruction of lsrael. Sloat, you do not know yet? Jews run no more gas chambers. They fight back, and quite well. Palestinians benefit from a deal. My plans go further than aid to the Palestinians. This is the beginning of jihad, holy war. I'm Arabia recapture for all believers. A compromise with lsrael impossible. Right. Allah. If you do not want a deal, why I'm here? You need a few messages convey to me. First. Tell your friends lsraeli that no deal is. There will be no peace until we have all of Arabia, including Palestine... ...united under Islam, a holy land where we can live in peace. Then you may continue your way to hell. And second? Tell Donnovan I his daughter as the next or last to release... ...or not. If he can allow the weapon to help U.S. lsrael is reduced... ...would be able to influence my decision. And now you have to leave. Martin, you come at the oddest times emerge. Give ' m a yellow badge. You have to draw Yafet. I. - Do. The inventor of the term 'top secret' Deserves the death penalty. Where were you? - In camp Sloat. Where is that? - You may only behind ' m as I say. Where is that? - If the girls are pretty. Does the national interest of lsrael above three spoiled bitches? Those are my terms. - Nof mine. You definitely need something from me. - If lsrael risk, you hear it. Yes, yes: Mats me now, I mats you later. So you love you? Within reasonable limits. Okay? - All right. I was blindfolded, so I know not sure, but I suspect in Lebanon. The headquarters is in a cave. Let this analysis. By a geologist. Was it? - Beware. It's a strange, soft rock from the cave. Also some? - The caves are very special. This huge, carved by humans. I think a quarry. If I can look at you I can topographic maps they might appoint. Our computers have it within five minutes . Meanwhile, it can go to the lab. A cave system in Lebanon? Can you draw me? Jack, put the tape with maps Lebanon there briefly. This is' s most advanced computer system of all intelligence. We are years in Russia and the U.S.. It is an American computer. - This is the information that it contains. Is the plan ready? What are they? - Holes at the top of the caves. Jack, put the tape infrared data on drive 2. This flat edge is input, huh? - From ' n another cave, not from outside. Is this only a part of the cave? I'd have to have more information. Like? - A direction would be nice. This is the south side. How do you know? They prayed when I was there and they do. Then I put the infrared data over the holes in the cave. It can be done without that extra step, but so we know for sure. I'm impressed. - And rightly so. I have examined the samples. They are definitely somewhere in southern Lebanon. Tasty accurate. - Confirmation is nice. If you take me, I take the last flight to Paris. Sorry, it's so ' n chaos since I'm home. Stop. What are you doing? - It's just a little test. Testje? For what? M ' n ears popping apart. And yours? - Terrible. This I am not used to. M ' My father has a pressurized cabin. Thank pilot. T rack ' m but right, we'll go back. Had one ear problems when you flew to Corsica? I think not. Absolutely not. And that pilot flew like a madman. Two bunks only. That must have been tight. Is this the bathroom? Describe ' m once. There was left a toilet, and the sink was straight. Was there a shower? There was no room for. - You are mistaken, there was a hand shower. What kind of wood was used in the cabin? With so - ' n tasteless yellow color. Sounds like satinwood. It is only in Dutch ships. So our boat had no shower. - But he was also the same? Absolutely. - But without curtains and bedspreads. But it was the same type of boat. Good. You go back to Paris. The plane is waiting. Was that it? I was hoping for some excitement. - I want to talk to you. Line a taxi. I'm not going home. I'm going with you to Corsica. Why do you think... I'm not a child. - I. I understand that thing with those ears though. We have flown a meter. We spent the whole time in Corsica and off you go to now, and I go along. I've been there. I might recognize something. I thought you were blindfolded? - I can feel the atmosphere. Maybe I hear or smell something. You never know. And if you recognized? - I paint m ' n her and do ' n sunglasses. I'm a different girl. A-dead. My friends down there. I can just do it. I want to take the risk. Right then. I thank you for your help. And then Helene? - I'll stay. You always have luck. Sorry, I did not recognize you. - Okay. That's just fine. Can you arrange bread and coffee? - I've spent it all in the salon. One? What's his name? Adrian T-a-r-d-e-s-t. Tardets. Port of Bastia, in Corsica. Antoine Is there? - What do you want? I'm Martin. I believe... - I know. Come on. Sit down. Antoine? - Moment. How did you get that man? - That they found me. What do you want to know? - Do you know one Adrian Tardets? Came from Algeria when the Arabs came to power... ...and bought a farm on the other side of the island. According to some, the Arabs for the ' bought m and are buddies. What is a farm? The time it was run down, but now come you're just like your Arab. Larry Martin. Two rooms, please. And would you call a number for me? Tel Aviv. Good, but it may take some time. Do your best. It's important. There's a call for you on my phone. Did they give a different number? Try that. Hamlekh is in Paris. I leave ' to connect to me. Please, do not go away now. - You must be tired. Go to sleep. You trying to seduce me? You do not bad. No, you think? What shall I do next? - What you need to do... more... ...is five steps backwards to do... ...lie down on the bed... Not a slumped. Elegant. And then I kiss you. Eyes closed. You can even get some sigh. And then I turn off the light. You go to sleep and I go to m ' n room. No, do not. What are you doing in Paris? I'm coming. - What happened? There is a new movie. - Who is free? None. And no body. Only a movie. When does the first flight to Paris? You can then book me? A person. - Let me alone? I'm back tomorrow. Go to sleep. They demand a total boycott comes all products in lsrael. My grandfather, Charles-Andr? Fargeau... ...should publish the names of anyone who acts lsrael... ...of the largest companies to the smallest shops. This is the last film. If the world satisfactorily respond... ...will have four months Gertrude Freyer be released. Four months later, following Joyce Donnovan. And after a year I will be released. Not over a whole year. But let them murder me. Please. Another whole year, I'm not full. Grandpa, tell them they have murder me. I am Abdul Mahjid Hacam. My allies and I are desperate. Our people are desperate. Only in this way can we ask attention to our fate. If we think a girl should be set correctly, you will find two bodies. That Girl, and that of her executioner. If all the girls are dead and I only remains... I will rob me of life. Did you see how they looked? So brave. Poor child. Murder. She asked me to murder her. Schloss, the chancellor always says you're on the case. How exactly? He works with me. - And what do you do? Cooperate with him. - Not so smart. I can not say anything about it. - Nonsense. Come on. Otherwise, I'll take you to the Senate. You can me as a British citizen anywhere drag around but me best. Then I'm going to answer stupid questions in Washington while you bury your child. That film is unprecedented. The is now between three rich girls and lsrael. This misery is caused by lsrael and the Jews. Why should Donnovan, Carter and I suffer? That sounds eerily familiar. Give the Jews but the debt. If the public wants it, , the film perfectly well on TV. Not this movie. And if your daughter is dead, the whole issue is forgotten. How long do you need? - Five days. And if we refuse? - Then you do not see your daughter again. I have to work. When I read something about that movie, I hand in my resignation. Bye, gentlemen. Do they decided something? - Freyer wants to show the film... ...but Fargeau has ensured that you get your five days. He is full of surprises. He is not alone. Where are we going? - To Corsica. Still handy, a neighbor Tardets nephew. We can but up here by car. The rest we have to walk. But I have two mules for the stuff. If the girls can you not sit and Tardets which is just a weirdo? Then we have a problem. - And I get the blame for sure. Then you will be eligible for a job at Newsweek. Graves. - I dig al. When this meter is declining, water flows into a storage tank in the house. The level in the tank is then dropped. There is a float in the tank, as in a toilet cistern. That opens automatically when the level is too low, and closes when the tank is full. How do you know what system they use? - That's the same everywhere. I shut off the supply after eating, as they go wash. Then we know for sure that the valve is open will be placed. Why not now? - We do not know how big the tank is. If we do close early and the water runs out, they smell a rat. I do not understand. They use nothing. What they perform there? Wait, there he goes. Where did that water come from? - What is leaking out as we sit down. Ready. If I twist it open, the gas passes through the open valve's house. Have much time? - All the time in the world. Na ' a minute of sleep everyone there. And remains so as long as it continues to flow. And overdose? - Can not. It is even odorless. From now on, it's a cinch. Go ahead. Come on. It's safe. He had the keys. Thank God. They are in order. It is our success. We are only at the half. Sit down, Sloat. Martin, did you know about this stupid action? - Sure. That surprises me. I'm disappointed. Do not you see that you're here with nothing achieved? You're going to jail. I think that's a good result. If I do not quite get, the girls executed. The girls are freed yesterday. - That's a big mistake. Then I have to use more violence. It works terrorism. Black September Without you nothing. They will demand my release. In lsrael we make no deals with terrorists. Then this is an exception. Black September will go anywhere in the world abduct children... ...and to bring death until I am free. Do the Palestinians commit political suicide? Their political suicide. I'm the desert does not purify the unbelievers to bring Lenin inside. I want to restore the faith, according to the laws of Muhammad. Place will be for all the faithful Palestinians. And the Communist Black September will be destroyed. Will you destroy the people who have to rescue you? They have turned their backs on God. He demands before destruction, and that is inevitable. But if we tell them what you're planning. They'll never believe you. You are the enemy. - Jou they believe. We have recorded every word. Black September will be enthralled. Allah the merciful, God of mercy. Why is this to you? Why have you forsaken me? Maybe he was ashamed of you. What do you want to achieve? The violence does not stop me. Only when lsrael admits or destroyed. Israel does not allow. - And we are not destroyed. But without bastards like you preaching violence is perhaps... ...talking about genuine peace. - Never. Allah will save me. He will save me so I can destroy you. Oh yeah? Then you'll have to wait for him. Within the cell. We need to get started. Take him. Lunch. How much fuel do you have? For up to four hours. Set sail for Algeria, stay at this altitude, call Paris. They have four hours to Corsica to three Palestinian comrades free. If Hacam, Kateb and Cheikh are not free before the fuel is... ...we destroy this unit with everyone on board.
