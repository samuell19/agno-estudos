It's time to come in, my loves! Come inside and have something warm to drink before I tuck you into your beds. Listen to your mother! Henry said he saw some injuns in the woods! Are you gonna grab your gun? Indians? Should we be worried, darling? Henry has an imagination as enormous as my love for you... - There are no savages within many miles of here. - Come children. We live in a good place... with good people... There's nothing to worry about! My boys sit out there on some days and just shoot the blazes out of them injuns. Just like the injuns shoot Buffalo... Just bang bang! bang bang! Until they're all gone. Well tha's what they say anyways. Well if you ask me it's a shame they have to waste the bullets at all... Eventually that strong federal government back East has got to do something! Why they don't send all those troops out here to kill those horrid creatures is just beyond me! This entire countryside remains infested! Extermination is the only answer! There is no helping them, there is no civilizing them. Why, getting rid of them once and for all is as much a blessing to them as it is to us. That's true! - A blessing?! Extermination, a blessing?! How can you--? Rebecca perhaps you should leave this conversation to those better suited, those that know a bit more about -- A bit more about what? About Indians? About extermination?! About murderous animals! Are you deaf? Blind? Those things are out there just outside of town right now! We keep giving them their own places to live-- Very nice places if you ask me! Yes yes every bit is nice is what we have here, but what do they do? Where are they now? Everywhere except for that land we have reserved just for them! It ain't like my boys are out there hunting them or anything! If they stayed on their land-- if they understood-- If if they weren't lurking about... my boys would have no reason to be shooting them all the time. If we let those animals have their way, they would come into town rape every last one of us-- And leave with our scalps to go sell down in Mexico! Would you stay in town if you were hungry? And you knew there was a rabbit just beyond our last road? Which animals? Which tribe of animals is it this time? Far as I know the only Indians to have been moved recently-- the only ones anywhere near us right now-- --are the Kumeyaay! They're nothing like Apache and not like-- They're Indians Rebecca! Subhuman savages-- maybe one is less violent than the other. --but there is no such thing anywhere as a peaceful-- What y'all are doing here seems very dangerous! If there isn't already a problem with that local group of Kumeyaay-- Do you think accusing them of murder... of being uncivilized Savages... is going to make things better? What do you mean, "if"? Mrs Payne's boys have at least one or two every day on their land! Not to mention the horror that visited upon the Dubois family this past Sunday Eve and-- Our very own Mrs Blake here! Poor Hester lost her husband just two weeks ago-- --and she just barely escaped death from the hands of those Savages herself! - God's Will! - God's Will! Everything I have ever read about-- or know-- What is it exactly that you know Mrs Falcone? Revel in your book learned naivete while you can! We'll hope that you come to your senses-- Before the real world out there ends up butchering you like it did me-- Before you lose everything! That wonderful husband and beautiful children of yours! - Miss Blake. Ma'am-- got stuff already stacked up over there that you wanted. And go grab the wagon and get your home if you like-- Did I say I was ready? Do I look ready? Go along finish up with the wagon. Wait with the horses. I'll be there momentarily. First the Blakes, then the Du Bois-- God knows who else! We're gonna shoot and scalp every damn injun we can find! - Well you drunkards ain't gonna find no injuns around here! What exactly can I do for you Roscoe? Please tell me what you need, before you destroy my store! Because we gonna shoot em... we gonna scalp em... and then we're gonna hang them! Ma'am... I'll give you man five dollars for each scalp you bring me! - How was town my love? - Cold. Oh Mi Amor! Spring is here though and warm beautiful days are coming soon. You can feel it in the air already! I really meant that awful Mrs Paine who runs the store and those hens who just sit there-- Clucking and cackling nonsense all day about things they know nothing about! Did something happen in town? They were talking about the Dubois family-- about what happened... Oh yes, a terrible slaughter. Such a tragedy. Frank was such a good man and he had a wonderful wife and family-- And the attack was so soon after the Blakes... You know Mr Blake was killed, and poor Hester... barely even left her bed spoke for a week since-- - Poor Hester! There's nothing poor about Hester! Her husband's probably relieved to be dead! She was right there... right alongside those awful old biddies blaming the Kumeyaay-- Calling them savages! Yeah, yeah, I heard the same things. Hester barely spoke but when she did she only said they looked and sounded like the Kumeyaay... And there have been reports of them leaving the reservation-- But it wasn't the Kumeyaay, Michael. They're peaceful people... I don't know much. My dad made sure I was raised exactly like him... - I'm sure you are. white as the whitest clouds... I never got to talk about mom. Or her mom, or our people... but I remember my grandma really good-- And I took what I could here and there-- and this ain't them, Michael! Those people are already out there starving-- and being hunted-- and now-- Now what? Did you tell them? Those Biddies! Give them facts to set them straight! No. I tried but this group of men men walked in saying the whole Dubois family got scalped by injuns-- The drunkest one of them said him and the whole drunk Posse with him were gonna scalp every injun they could find-- And Mrs Blake offered to pay them! She offered what? What happened? I don't know! I was so upset that I just ran out of the store and I forgot to pay And I just I rode home as fast as I could-- And was so upset I forgot your paper too-- I'm sorry... I know you needed it to finish the paperwork for Mrs Blake to properly inherit Mr Blake's shares in Blake Inc. and that's the whole reason I went in the first place-- There is nothing to worry about, Mi Amor... I need to ride to town to see Hester tomorrow morning to confirm her plan before I write this up anyway-- She is not releasing those shares and cashing them in as I suggested. I will stop by Paine's General and pay Mrs Paine as I pick up the paper. Once I get Hester's signature I can finally wrap this business up with Blake Industrial Gold Mining Inc.! If you like we can take Edward and Emma and move anywhere you want. Back to the city! Back to civilization... I heard it's supposed to be very beautiful back East in Baltimore. Anywhere. As long as you're by my side. I love you so much-- We think alike Mi Amor-- I love you too... Emma, dear, go get your papa and brother. It's time for dinner. Yes Mama. Eddie! Daddy! dinner's ready! Mama! Emma said she ate all the cornbread! Did she now... Let's see if we can find some more... Excuse you, young man! Emma, will you please say grace? Yes Papa... Give us, oh God, of the nourishing meal, well-being to the body, the frame of the soul. Give us oh God of the honey sweet milk, the sap, and the savor for the fragrant farms--Through Christ we pray. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Mama? Was Henry Dubois a bad boy? Is that why God let him get killed by the injuns? Edward Michael! We do not say "injuns"-- But that's what the boys at school say-- Well, we do not say it in this house-- or anywhere else for that matter! Yes ma'am... But was he a bad boy? And his Daddy too? No mejito... He was not killed because he was a bad person. He was killed because of bad people-- No, darling. God doesn't punish people. Henry was a good boy and he is in Heaven now. More cornbread? Yum! Job was God's most loyal follower and all types of bad things happened to him-- Sometimes bad things just happen to good people... That's why God has servants... Revengers, to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil... Romans chapter 13... Shut those damn kids up! Mi Amor! You bastards! Break into our house-- attack us in the night! Sneak into our house! Attack my children! Attack my wife! No! Gotcha! Michael! No! Get him off of me! You damned idiot! you almost got me! Well, I got him, though. Right? Not yet. Almost there-- - No! - No, Michael! No! He's there now. And with his own gun. It's a nice gun... Who are you? Why are you doing this? Well now... What do we have here? You was at the store earlier today, weren't ya? Yeah... What are you some kind of injun lover or something? Well, that's gonna make this all the more fun! Oh yeah! That's gonna look real nice up on my wall! What you think boys? Yeah! She's ready! Go get Simon! Simon! Ain't seen nobody at all. Yall safe to keep at your work-- No no no no no, it ain't like that, boy. This is for you. My present. Yeah finally watch you become a man. Well I'm just here to keep watch. That's all I'm good for remember. Remember? Everybody gotta grow up sometime. All right? I ain't gonna be here to protect your sorry ass forever. Nah.

Fuck "can't", boy. It aint' "can't". It's "won't" and I can't abide by that no longer! I can't abide that anymore! You ain't shit.

Hey, I'm Simon-- Kumeyaay-- What? Kumeyaay? Did you say Kumeyaay? Mi a... Kumeyaay... I ain't never going to get you out to that reservation but... Look, I'll get you to that Old Fort on the way... Come on... I must be crazy. Only person in town trying to find an injun out there... We'll see, I guess... Kumeyaay! We're here for help... Kumeyaay, please please help us. We both Kumeyaay and we need your help. Simon... Simon... I'm Simon. And this... this is Mia... Mia... we don't... I don't speak...I don't Kumeyaay... Neither my sweet boy, do we... Simon, you're awake. Good... Are you okay? I think I fell down... That you did. And down for two days you stayed. Mia! Where's Mia? We are taking good care of your mother-- I will take you to her and then it is probably best that you-- She-- she ain't seen my mama... but she's... my... I ain't leaving her. That's it. And that's all. Yes. Well, we often find family outside our blood... They call me "Delicate Poison"... Delicate Poison... OK... What happened to her? Can you tell me that? It was an attack. An attack. Some... some men-- What men? What did they do to her? Why? They killed her her family. They killed her kids. They killed her husband and they thought they killed her too! Natives? No... but they-- Dressed like natives? How did--? Where is she? She gonna be okay? Badly injured, including burns and broken bones. But her body is strong. Out here she will recover, but on the inside-- She may still be dying. You can leave in the morning, go back to your people in peace-- No! I ain't going nowhere without her. She's all I got. She's been your friend for a long time? Never met her before but she's the most important person in my life. Well um like you she hasn't moved since your arrival-- Wait. She hasn't even moved? This is a good thing. She needs time to heal and her body needs medicine and she's getting both. You also-- I need to make sure she's okay. That's all I need. I'm gonna be staying in here from now on... I'm gonna be staying in here from now on... I'm gonna be staying in here from now on... I'm gonna be staying in here from now on... Simon. I'm glad to see you eating. You look stronger already. Thank you, Delicate Poison. Is that your brother? I heard he's called "ghost" around our camp... Is that his name? Yes, he's called Ghost with Silent Knives Protects. Unfortunately it began as a mocking nickname. "Ghost". But like his appearance he has embraced it. Do you know--? Is there like um-- is there a story behind that name? Ghost with Silent Knives Protects? Of course. And I'm sure -- when the time is right -- if you want, he'll share it with you. But that story is his to tell... Thank you again, Delicate Poison. I can call you Delicate, right? Yes. Yes please, Simon. I think I'd quite like that. Uh hello "Protector"... I wanted to introduce myself-- I'm Simon... I brought Mia here... I was just wondering. Could you show me that move you were doing just a minute ago? Simon! It's Mia. She's awake-- You need me? She needs me? How is she? Listen... Jesus Lord in heaven every time I'm in there, she just lies there like a statue! That's why I wanted you here. I have remedies she needs badly but I need her to trust me... Simon, come in there with me. Help me help her. Help me soothe her. Please-- No! No! I brought fruit-- Why are they called lost people? Not these people. All people. It is our thought that as the European ways continue to spread here... we are all being moved further and further from nature-- That all of us have lost-- or are losing-- our way. You see, it is not we who are "the" lost people... It is people who are lost. White black brown yellow. Skin or country, it doesn't matter... Because when belched smoke becomes our sky... when piss and poisons run in streams then we have lost. We have all lost... We merely recognize-- We want to convince sheep to become their own shepherd-- What? This country. This system. At war with itself-- The people of this country at war with themselves-- Yeah, no no. That war-- it's over-- But there is a deeper war being fought still. Their impermanence is burned into their name... Separate and still equal defies the very logic they claim to prize so highly. No Union can stand forever... So... so like we're not lost people we're we're at war with the U.S... like like seditionists... Like those Southern States in the South that they're on fire after all this time. No. We're at war with the future they manifest. Our war is not merely fought with weapons and violence... Our war is fought with ideas! We do not fight for Glory. If we win, our names will not be written across the sky in fire. Then how will you know? We will know when this country is no longer a group of United States or any other sort of state thing... And are instead One Nation. All as one people, more the same than not. And if... if we lose...? It will matter not. Our names, like this country, hammered into dust quickly. This is natural. Even that which dies quickly may seem strong early on. Their Nation. Our cause... Her family. It's all the same to Nature. Every moment of history survives only while strong and then it feeds the next moments... which grow stronger as the previous parishes. The present moment forever only basks in the prosperity of now. Blinded by itself to the past, and proudly ignorant to a future without it-- Thirsty... Of course you are darling. Sit still, sit still. Some water. Slowly though. Slowly... This is good. It's much faster than I expected. Hey, do you want some food? Some food. Something to eat? Um so... it seems like she's getting better. She wants to start training. Immediately like she won't take no for an answer. Ghost... Ghost! Please let us know the next time you are giving such treatment to this woman. Of course, brother! Since you asked. What an unusual request request for you to make. So... that means I can start training too. Right? When does she start? Tomorrow. Delicate, did you see that? Oh! I nailed that... never shot an error before last week! Oh man, what's next? What's next, Delicate? Well, next you eat. And then you rest, and I'll see you back here tomorrow morning. I can't hit shit with this thing... my arm is fucking useless! Might as well just have one. We will train your arm and make it stronger, Mia. With your injuries, you cannot expect instant success with an instrument as precise as a bow and arrow. Give it time. See you back here tomorrow morning? Yeah. I'm gonna stay here and try firing a few more arrows. Like you said... gotta get stronger. Just don't exhaust yourself, Mia. Remember, this is only one weapon. Next I will teach you to master six shooter, blades, staff... First knife training today? Yeah. Protector gave this to me. He said he made it when he's about my age. He showed me how to take care of it... sharpen it... I'm gonna take a real good care of this! Ain't anyone ever give me nothing nice before. Look what I made! Been working at it at night for two weeks. This is amazing! Right? Amazing. And dangerous-- Mia, do you ever think about anything except killing? Ever? Not really. Why would I? This place. These people. Something special is happening here, Mia. They've accepted us... They, they want us to be a... they want me to be a part of their world. I ain't never had that before... You don't seem to give a shit about anything-- I don't... Don't need to either... Got you. Got Delicate Poison. Y'all help me deal with anyone else. Y'all are all I need... Look, I I know you you done lost a lot that's why I care. I-- I just I don't want you to be blind to what you got here. This place and these people are... I just I hope you can see it before it's too late. I can see just fine, Simon. I thought you'd have been more impressed is all! All right, everyone line up. Three on this side and three on this side. During this round you will only be using your staff. On my mark. Go! Ow! Okay I see how it is... Get her off me! Mia, please. Stop! Mia. No. Enough! Mia, you will stop this now or I will be forced to stop you myself and I guarantee you will be injured! Ain't none of you gonna hurt me! I'm the one does the hurting now! But you're right. I took it a bit too far. I'll stop-- We all have! You will not return to training for three days, You must learn control, Mia. Control?! You want to control me? Well, to hell with all of you! - Mia! Stop! - Stop! All you have to do is know the Stars-- - Stars... - Hmm? Stars. That's what they're being learned up on. She's teaching them so they always know to find their way back home... What did you see? I'm not okay. I won't be okay until I have killed every one of them who took mine from me. Why I am still alive. Home, Simon. I think it's time to go home... But I thought, I thought-- Wait! you ain't gonna-- No, I mean my house. Gotta see that place where they... where I... No, I mean my house. Gotta see that place where they... where I... No, I mean my house. Gotta see that place where they... where I... But I can't keep pretending it's not there. At least deserve to say goodbye... Get that behind me, then I'll come back. Finish healing. Finish training. Then I'll start the killing... Well, ya ain't going back there without me... Of course not... But I think it's best we ride out of your first light tomorrow morning... without anyone else any the wiser to all this. Ain't having no discussions... I always wanted to doctor those animals growing up. You know? Like they always just been better to me than any human bean. Being. Huh? It's not human bean. It's human being. Yeah, I guess that do make sense. They always being something. Mad. Mean. Two-Faced. Bad. Sad... Nuh-uh. This ain't sad. This? Is being angry. Resolute. This is taking control. There'll be time for sad after... After what? Whoa... oh that ain't good. Hyah! Mia! Mia wait! What's that little guy up to? Looks like he's in a rush to get his ass shot off! Hey, that's no little boy! What the Hell Stop! Stop. All right you're gonna have to shoot through them to get to me and I'll be blasting too! Oh god no! No! You ain't hurting no more kids! - Mia, Mia! Listen, all right-- I don't know you. We ain't got to do this, all right? We can just go all separate ways and we all could be all right-- All right, so... That's right. Ain't nobody gotta be do no shootin. Get down here Sarah. Mia, what are you doing--? Watch out. Watch out! Stop, don't you move! Or I swear to God I'll rip that arm the rest of the way off and I'll beat you to death with it. Screw you-- Never shoulda give you that chance I guess... Your taste ain't changed none, I see. Still after innocent women and children! Listen, lady! I ain't never seen you! All right? My eye! It ain't polite to stare! Oh God! You never seen me? Look! This is what your hands did to me! You did this to me! Mia, Mia! Not now, Simon! Sarah, don't stare! She's a monster, Mommy! A witch! - Sarah! - Monster? Maybe. Tell you what-- Y'all get on them horses, ride straight down this road. And don't stop till you find the goddamn Sheriff! You tell him about how yo got attacked and the fucking monster came and saved ya! Go on! Get out of here! Nuh-uh! Not you. Where you think you're going, you murderous bastard?! You think I'm just gonna let you crawl away? Please... please... Not with my claw in your spine you ain't! I can't feel my legs! I severed your spine! And here I figured you didn't even have one! Shit. Ain't the first time I've been wrong, I guess! Please... please don't... I remember begging. Didn't do much for me! Mia! It's not him! Mia! It's not him! It's not him. It's not him. - No! No! - It wasn't him! What did you do? He was mine! It wasn't him, Mia. No it wasn't him it wasn't him. It wasn't him. I know it wasn't him because-- I know who it was that did this to you... to your family. I was there I-- I saw it all-- It was my daddy! It was my awful daddy who caused you all this! I was there I saw it all... I couldn't do nothing. But I-- I just-- I took this to remember you by-- Somehow keep you alive maybe by having it... But then I saw you! I saw you. I saw you alive-- I thought I was seeing things but you was alive and so I just I've been just trying to help since... since I couldn't help then. I finally feel like I matter. You. You matter, Mia. You matter, Mia. Come on. This detour already has us fighting the Sun. Let's move! So... this is what you're looking for? I don't know. Maybe. I guess. Just needed this to move forward... To remind me... Couldn't have done this a month ago, Simon. Thank you. For coming. For being here. Of course. Couldn't have stopped me if you tried. Will you tell me about them? Starting to remember more and more... Emma loved horses. All animals really. You remind me of her. One of her Papa's friends was a metal worker and he taught her how to make shoes-- This was her first one. Did she keep it for good luck? Oh no. She didn't believe in luck. Very much a child of God... closer to him than I ever was... I don't know where she got that. Michael... my husband... He'd come home and beat his duster inside the door which I would always get angry about and he knew it... He would just call out "Mi Amor"... I could hear him speak his native tongue for hours... Mi Amor... Oh! Wait! That's what you were saying-- I thought rattlers were coming out of the floor! What're you talking about? When I found you or followed you-- you you were saying something. I thought you were saying your name. Mia. You were saying "mi amor"... That makes sense. The first thing I said in the morning and last thing I said at night... Well... what's that mean? It means "my love". I like that. That's nice. But then don't... don't you want me and everyone else to start calling you Rebecca? Like it says in that locket? No. I ain't her no more-- Rebecca died here. With her family... We're gonna lose the sun. I still have one thing for us to do before we head home. Welcome back. You look well. Come in. We have tea for you. Oh thanks! My whole body's aching. Ghost... Interesting. It's bitter. Thanks. Thanks. You seem more at peace. I take it your visit was pleasant and uneventful. Well... I wouldn't exactly say that. Did you face trouble? No trouble. Got to practice some is all. Still learning to shoot with this hand... but my claw work like a charm! There was these guys... they were going to kill this family but we-- well Mia-- This tastes like shit. You were not ready. Finish it all. It will rejuvenate you. Body, Spirit and Mind. Yeah, well ready or not we killed the shit out of both of them. Two less assholes out there terrorizing women and children. I call that a win. Oh you're right. I'm starting to feel better already! Mia you still have much to learn in the ways of combat and your rage blinds you still. Ain't gonna argue with that none. I just feel it come and I-- Oh. Oh. Yeah! Oh. You're right. Oh I feel great. you guys want to go outside? Let's go outside! Come on! Come on! I hope you guys were listening. I was agreeing with you! when do we start? You will find your spirit animal and use it to learn stronger focus. You started when you took your first sip of tea from the vine. You guys see this right? Whose horse is this? This horse belongs to no one, but he seems to have chosen you. Perhaps you are brothers. No. No, you're my brother, Protector. Delicate, you were right. family is blood. It's just... just not the same... Simon! Dang! Don't know what you guys gave us but... I don't think that little guy... can handle it...
