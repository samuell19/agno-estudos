(mysterious music) - Can you make sure your phone's on silent? Is that good, you think? - [Steven] Yeah. - I don't even know if we'll need it. - [Steven] Oh, I have a light on my camera. Kay, rolling. - Hey guys, it's me, your girl, Ruby Real and in this video, I'm gonna be debunking some weird shit. Okay, one more time. Okay, this is it, this is the one. Hey guys, nope, okay one more time, we got this. - [Steven] You got this. - Okay, I'm ready, here we go. Hey guys, it's your girl, Ruby Real. And in this video I'm gonna be debunking the strangest most trendiest myth in the Pacific Northwest. Do you know about the tree game? Do you think it's real? I'm gonna find out. Okay, how was that? - [Steven] Ugh, not bad. - Not bad as in not that good? And if you're new here, make sure you hit that like and subscribe button. - [Steven] Here's Cali Carson picking out her outfit of the day. - I was thinking of going like this. It's what I'm most comfortable in. - Seriously, throw something on okay, we gotta go. - I don't know what to wear. (upbeat music) - [Steven] Go Cali, go Cali, all right, show us what you got. Hey! (upbeat music) Ruby looking thrilled. - Hey, what's up guys? It's Cali Carson here with another kick ass video for y'all. Today is a very special day because I'm joined by two of my favorite people, Ruby Real and Steven Lane. All right, make sure to check out their channels if you haven't already. And if you're new here and you like what you see and you want to see more of it, go ahead and hit that subscribe button here. - [Steven] Ugh, fuck. - What's that? - [Steven] I had you framed wrong. - And if you're new here and you like what you see and you want to see more of it, go ahead and hit that subscribe button here. - Got it. Hey guys, I'm Steven Lane and today you're gonna be joining me in an adventure. I have with me Cali Can Do Carson and Ruby Real. This is gonna be insane, this is gonna be epic. Have you ever heard of the tree game? I hadn't before this either, but it's supposed to be scary and we're gonna find out if it's real. Ruby asked me to go and I couldn't say no so here we go. We're out here walking to the next location. It's a beautiful day in the city. Who are we going to meet? - I should talk about the tree game first. - [Steven] All right, tell us. What is the tree game? - Okay, so if you don't already know, there is a tree in a North Vancouver forest that looks really, really creepy. So naturally people created a scary story around it. But the thing is there isn't one official story but someone did create a trendy little game that people now think is real. The idea is that if you circle around the tree you'll get transferred to another dimension. - [Steven] And then what? - And then I don't know. - [Steven] Okay, go for it. - Okay, so this story got really popular because in the last year there's been a missing hiker. They went into the forest to specifically play the game. His name was Harvey Owen. People claim that he's trapped in the other dimension 'cause there are people who have claimed to see him. - [Steven] What do you think about that, Cali? - I don't like it. - The people who've attempted the tree game claimed to have gotten lost and disoriented for what seemed like days. They usually come back with little to no memory of what actually happened to them. They claim to have heard strange noises and seen creepy people who they might think is the missing hiker, Harvey Owen. And then of course there are people who have gone and not seen anything out of the ordinary. - [Steven] Which is what you saw. - Exactly. - [Steven] So you've been there? - Yes, I should talk about that. - [Steven] What was your experience like? - It was exactly how I thought it was gonna be. I went there with a couple of friends and we saw the tree. Nothing happened. - [Steven] But you never did the game? - No, that's why I'm going back. This time, I'm gonna do the game and prove that all this is just a silly myth. - [Steven] Turtle, look at the turtle. Okay, who are we going to see right now? - Okay, so we are off to see Trent Lewis who has played the tree game and claimed to have gone through the other dimension. He's gonna tell us about his experience and explain to us exactly how to do the game correctly. Because apparently a lot of people who attempt it don't do it right. - [Steven] Do you think this guy's for real? - Do I think that he walked around a tree and got transferred to another dimension? Smells like bullshit to me. - [Steven] Here's the man with the story, Trent Lewis. Rolling. - Nobody knows the true history of this tree. Is it some satanic ritual? Is it something left behind by aliens? No one knows. - [Ruby] And you think this is real because you claim to have gone into the alternate dimension? - Okay listen, if I'm being fully honest when I first heard about all this I thought it was absolute bullshit but that's until I came to investigate it myself. And my experience was terrifying. It changed everything. - [Steven] Go for it. - Okay well I don't remember much but I remember coming to check it out for myself. And as I started walking around, I found myself lost. Now it felt like I was lost for a really long time, you know? It was like days, but it was always daytime. And I remember it was like time, it just stood still. And I was confused and there was this weird noise coming from the trees like a crackling, like it was, and then a glow from the trees. I got to be honest, I've never seen anything like it. - [Ruby] Who came up with the idea that you have to walk around the tree in order to transfer into the other dimension? - Look, I think Harvey came up with that to make it fun right, to just popularize it. I don't believe you have to do the ritual. I know that things happen when you do it but I think that there's a portal somewhere around the area near the tree and if it happens to be open when you're there that's, see that's when you get stuck in it. (upbeat music) - We're not gonna actually do the ritual thing, are we? - [Steven] Why not? What are you scared? - Yeah, shit like this freaks me out, not gonna lie. What do you think about what that Trent guy said? - To be honest, I thought he was gonna be more of a weirdo but he almost sounded convincing. - So do you think there's a possibility this thing is real? - Hell no. And I'm gonna prove him and all you others wrong. - This is it. The beginning of the end. - More like the beginning of the truth. - Watch this. Ruby, are you sure we're going the right way? - [Ruby] Yeah. - Are you sure? Because I feel like we're not going the right way. - I have the map. - Well, what if the map is wrong? Are you sure we're going the right way? - [Cali] You're so annoying. - She's pissed, but she loves it. - [Cali] Do you think we're lost? - No. - [Cali] Are you sure? - I have the map. We went too far, we have to backtrack. - I was right. - Found it. It's this way. - [Steven] I thought you said this was a river. This looks more like a creek. Hey, it's way easier to cross over here. All right, I'm gonna cross. All right guys, strike a pose. Beautiful. - Officially out of cell phone range. - [Steven] So the map is now useless? - Pretty much, but we don't need it. - [Cali] Is the plane gonna break the audio? - [Steven] Give it a second. - Hey guys, we're almost at the tree and Ruby here is about to perform the ritual and then we're gonna find out if this thing is real or is it fake? - [Steven] Mm, that's a good angle. Oh, there it is. - [Ruby] Okay, we're here. - [Steven] This is it? Where is it? Okay, it looks a little evil - [Cali] Creepy as fuck, man. - Okay so the Trent guy said that the portal is somewhere in the vicinity of the tree, but in this video we want to debunk the myth and the game. So I'm gonna do the ritual exactly the way it's supposed to be done. - I'm getting weird, bad vibes. - [Steven] Do you need me to hold you? - Well, that'd be nice. - Okay, I'm gonna go for it. Are you guys rolling? - [Steven] We're rolling. - Hey guys, I'm about to perform the tree game. Supposedly if I successfully go around the tree I'll be transferred to an alternate reality. Wish me luck. - [Steven] Good luck, Ruby. How do you feel? - Like I'm still in the same dimension. - Technically, I should also be in a parallel universe or whatever, because I just did it with you. Go for it, Cali. - I'm good. - [Steven] Come on, do it for the video. - Is it necessary? - [Steven] Do it, do it, Cali. - No. - [Steven] Ruby, shouldn't she do it for the video? (sighs) Okay, go for it. - There, done. Happy? - [Steven] That wasn't so bad, was it? - No. - [Steven] So what do you think? - I think it's just a silly game that somebody made up and somehow it got trendy, but as you can see none of us transferred to an alternate dimension, we're all still here. - [Steven] Who's gonna win, Cali Carson versus Ruby Real. - All right, Ruby Real, it's on. (grunting) - [Steven] Oh, okay. - No, no, no, no, stop. (laughing) - The tree game is a load of bullshit and today we proved it. If you don't believe us, get your ass out here and try it yourself. I'm Ruby Real and this myth has been #debunked. - [Steven] Wow, Ruby, so much attitude. - Got to get my point across. - Okay, are we heading back? - Yeah, we'll be back before dark. - So what's your next video gonna be? - I was actually just thinking about that. There's this scam where people are being led to adopt puppies, but there's no puppies. So people are spending big money on nothing and I might investigate that. - [Steven] I thought you were more about debunking shit? - Oh, I am. There's this alien abduction story I want to tackle too. - [Steven] What the fuck is this? - Oh my gosh, what is this? Look at like the little sticks, are like so perfectly put like together. - Should I step in it? - Go. - [Steven] She's doing it. - Do I start a chant or? (laughing) - [Steven] Are you gonna step in there, Ruby? - Why not? Nothing's gonna happen. - [Steven] You guys are nuts. I ain't going in there. - This was very anticlimactic. I expected a lot more out of this. (laughing) - Alright, so we're just gonna do this for one quick shot. Ruby go first and then Cali after and I'll just follow you guys. All right and go. - So you guys are getting pretty close. - [Cali] What? - Come on, I see it. - [Cali] Maybe a little. - Have you guys been getting into it? - [Cali] No. Okay, don't tell Steven I told you, but we've been seeing each other for a couple of weeks now. He just wants to keep it a secret. - Wow. And how do you feel about that? - [Cali] I don't know. It's what he wants. - [Ruby] I'm just getting B-roll. We call this pee role. - Is this the trail we first came down? - [Ruby] Sure is. Okay, I think we got enough shots, time to put this thing away. (crackling) - What the hell is that? (crackling) Didn't that Trent guy say he heard noises? - Yep, and that solves that mystery. He heard trees cracking. - [Steven] No, but it didn't sound natural. - It sounded like electricity. - [Steven] What the fuck? - We must have circled back. - [Cali] How? - Fuck, I don't know. - [Steven] Are you kidding me? I thought we were almost back at the parking lot. We were backtracking this entire fucking time? Now we got to hike for another hour and a half. - I'm sorry guys, I don't know what happened. - [Steven] What do you think that noise was? - I don't know. Maybe something to do with the magnetic field. I'm no science expert. Ruby could also be right, it could be the trees or the planes. - [Steven] Ruby, do you think it's possible we ended up in another dimension, parallel universe, alternate reality? - [Ruby] Fuck off. - [Steven] I'm just asking. Do you think it's possible? - No, I just think we took a wrong turn. Okay, so technically as soon as we cross this river, we should be on the other side. We'd have to cross it again to be on the side of the tree. This is where I'm confused. - Let's not let it happen again. - Oh geez. - Careful, Cali. - [Cali] I'm trying. - Okay, so we made it back to the main trail or at least what we think is the main trail. - This is 100% the main trail. - Okay so Ruby says we're back, which is great, 'cause we've been hiking for over five hours now and we did not pack nearly enough food or water to last us this and we're all very hungry. - [Cali] Give a sign off. - I'll do it in the parking lot. (crackling) - [Cali] It's so creepy. What the hell is that? - I don't know, but I'm about to shit my pants. - It's gone, right? - [Cali] I don't hear anything. - So fucking weird. - [Cali] What's going on? - We rounded the corner where Ruby said the parking lot was and we got this, more trail in a never ending forest. Where's the parking lot, Ruby? - It should be just right up here. - [Steven] You've said that a few times. - Well it has to be. - [Steven] Are you admitting you got us lost? - Don't put this all on me. You can help figure this shit out too. - [Steven] You said it was easy. Once we got to the main trail. - It is, which is why we're not leaving the main trail. Don't film me. - Give me the map. - It won't update because there's no cell reception. - I've had enough of your fucking bullshit. I'm leading the way this time. - I don't know what's going on. We're not going off any wrong turns. I was sure both times - You were sure? Then why are we fucking back here? - Don't fucking yell at me. - I'm not yelling. - You're raising your voice and it's not helping. - You know what's not helping? Your directions. I don't want to hike for another hour and a half so I'm doing the map this time. - [Cali] What if we try going the other way? - No, that doesn't make any sense. We'd only go further into the forest. - [Cali] Guys. - [Steven] What did you see? - I saw a guy. He was just standing in the path like 500 yards away, no joke. He was wearing hiking gear and he was just standing there. And then I turned to tell you guys but when I looked back he was gone. - Let's just go. - Well, shouldn't we see who it is? Maybe they can help us. - No, we're in the deep fucking woods and it's getting late. I don't want to be making friends out here. - Well, unless they know how to get out. - Or the way to fucking murder us. - [Steven] Yeah, let's just go. If he wanted to help us, he would have came and talked to us. - Fuck, I have the chills after seeing that guy. - [Steven] Maybe it was Harvey Owen. - Don't say that shit. - My feet are in some serious pain. - How can you even understand this thing? - Look, once we get to the river, all we have to do is cross it, hike up straight to the main trail and then head south for like 15 minutes and then we should get to the parking lot. - [Cali] That Trent guy said he got lost out here and that he was hearing strange noises and seeing things. - Yeah. - [Cali] So isn't that what's happening to us? - Yeah. - [Cali] Well don't you think that maybe we're- - Look, I don't know. - Look, look! Did you get that? - [Steven] Fuck, I don't know. I don't know, I don't know if I got it. - [Cali] What the fuck was that? - [Steven] Something really fucked up is going on here. What if it's aliens? Here we go, crossing the river again. I don't know how many times this is but I never want to see this river again. Okay, we've gone this way both times and both times we've ended up back at the tree. - Okay, fine, it doesn't make sense, but we'll go the other way. - Yeah, we're gonna go the other way. - It doesn't fucking make sense. - Hey, hey over here! (plane whirring) - Hello, help! Hello! - We should have at least passed the parking lot by now or at least seen it. - Well, should we backtrack? - No. - Well, what if we walked past it? When we first went on the trail the parking lot was right there. We just need to find it. - That's what I don't understand. It's not a very hidden parking lot. It's like very visible. - [Cali] Here we are, back at the tree. - Okay, I'm starting to think that maybe something actually might've happened to us. I mean, we keep hearing strange noises and we seem to be going in some never ending loop. So I think our best bet is just to go around the tree again and try to reverse this thing. Fuck me, I sound crazy. - [Steven] Okay, go for it. Let me turn my light on. - [Ruby] Maybe don't film her puking. - [Steven] If this doesn't work, then what? - Then, I don't know, out of ideas. Cali, you good? I'll go check on her. Cali? Where'd she go? - [Steven] She's not there? - No, did she come out? - [Steven] No. - [Ruby] What the fuck? - [Steven] Cali? - [Ruby] Cali! - [Steven] Cali! - [Ruby] Cali! Cali! - Cali! - Cali! - Cali! - I don't see her. Cali! Cali! Cali, where are you? What the fuck is happening? - [Steven] I don't know. - Why are you shooting this? She couldn't have just disappeared - [Steven] The way things have been going, it doesn't seem that unlikely. - Well, we have to find her. We have to get her back, right? - [Steven] She's gone. She wouldn't have taken off as a joke. - Fuck me, is this thing real? - [Steven] What about that guy she saw? You think he might've done something? - We would have heard her or him or some sort of rustling. We were like 10 feet away from her. Cali, thank God - [Steven] Cali, where'd you go? What happened to you? - [Ruby] Cali, come here. Why's she just standing there? Cali, come on. - [Steven] Why the fuck is she standing like that? - [Ruby] Are you okay? Did something happen? - [Steven] What is she doing? - [Ruby] Cali? - [Steven] Oh fuck, what the fuck? What the fuck? Where'd she go? What just happened? What just happened? - Fuck! - What just happened? - She just, she just fucking disappeared. How the fu? - [Steven] Fuck, what the fuck? What the fuck? Come on! - [Ruby] Well, we can't just leave her. - [Steven] She's not with us anymore. Something's up, you saw it. - We have to do something. We have to get her back. - [Steven] We're fucking losing our minds out here. The longer we sit around, the more danger we put ourselves in. We need to get as far away from that tree as possible. - Fuck okay, let's go. - [Steven] Look at your phone. - Why? - [Steven] Tell me what time it says. - 11 p.m. It's still light out. - [Steven] Exactly. It's like time keeps going on, but not for us. - We're totally in another dimension. - This is bullshit, stop filming me! - [Ruby] Oh, what? So now you're the only one that can film someone having a breakdown? - You said this thing wasn't fucking real, Ruby. - [Ruby] I didn't think that it was. - Well now what? We're just lost souls and we walk around in circles forever? - [Ruby] Don't give up hope yet. - We're gonna cross the river and I swear to God if we're at that fucking tree again, I'm gonna lose my mind. - [Ruby] We have to stick together. - I know. - [Ruby] Did you and Cali have a thing? - What? - [Ruby] I just know she liked you and you guys flirted like a lot, so I'm just curious. - I mean, we were talking, kind of seeing each other secretly but not really. - [Ruby] Wow, I can't believe you never told me. - Fuck, I feel so bad that she's gone. I just want her back. - [Ruby] I know, I'm so sorry, man. - I didn't even need a video. I was just bored. - [Ruby] I didn't mean for all of this to happen. I thought it was gonna be a fucking joke. - Same. - [Ruby] What did you like about Cali? - Why are you asking me this? - [Ruby] I'm just trying to talk about anything other than what's going. - We need to talk about what's going on because we need to figure it out. - We need a mental break. (crackling) It's getting louder. I'm so fucking tired. - [Steven] Same and hungry. - There's one left. You want to split it? - [Steven] No, you have it. Okay, give me some. - I think we need a longer break. - [Steven] What kind of break? - Like a rest. Maybe if we get some sleep, we might be able to think better. - [Steven] You want to sleep here? - God no, by the river? Is that okay with you? - [Steven] Yeah. - Oh my God, I am so sore. You don't have to. It feels really good though. We should probably try to get some sleep. Don't leave my side - Shit, I forgot to turn the camera off. All right, so we successfully woke up and we didn't disappear so that's a good sign. How long do you think we were sleeping? - I'm not sure. Maybe like three hours. I feel so much better though. - [Steven] Same. - But the hunger is getting worse. - [Steven] What's the first thing you're gonna do when you get out of here? - If? - [Steven] Sorry when. - I mean I don't really want to think about it because it's pure torture, but all I want is buffalo cauliflower wings and tofu spinach lasagne. - [Steven] I just want a steak. - Gross. - [Steven] Like a big juicy ribeye. - Gag. Although I'm so hungry that I'd probably eat the steak right now and just deal with the guilt afterward. - [Steven] Let's try this trail. Even though it doesn't make sense on the map, we haven't gone down here yet. - Okay. Hello? - [Steven] What are you doing? Cali saw a guy and then disappeared shortly after. - [Ruby] We have to take our chances, okay? Hi. Hello? - [Steven] Fuck, I don't like the looks of this guy. - Come on. Hello? What the fuck? He went this way, I swear to God. Fuck, now he disappeared, he fucking disappeared. Oh shit, look. - [Steven] Hey man, we're a little lost. Oh shit, go, go. - Run! - [Steven] Oh shit. Oh fuck. Keep going, keep going, keep going. - We're fucked, we're so fucked. - [Steven] Just stop saying that. - I want to go home. - [Steven] Hey, look at me. It's gonna be okay. - No, it's not. How can you say that? It's not gonna be okay. - [Steven] Come here. - Are we gonna die out here? - [Steven] Don't think like that. Come here. As long as you're with me, everything will be okay. Okay? - Do you ever think about me or the fun we had? You left the camera on. There are things we know we know, things we know are unknown and then there are unknown unknowns. Whatever this is just became a new known unknown. - [Steven] But how do we prove anything? - Video. - [Steven] Right, but they'll think we're faking it. - No, as soon as we get out of here, I'm going full on with this thing. I'm calling up that Trent guy and we're gonna get a team of scientists up in here to figure this shit out. - [Steven] You're crazy. I'm never coming back here again. - I'm also thinking about deleting my social media. - [Steven] There's no way you'll do that. - Why wouldn't I? - [Steven] What are you gonna do instead? - I've always wanted to go to school for journalism. I mean my channel's kind of a prelude to that anyways. All of my videos are investigative stories. Maybe it's time to take it to a professional level, tell some stories that matter, make a difference, you know? - [Steven] You're gonna make less money on the professional level than you would with your social media. - You don't know that. Actually, that's probably true, but I don't know, it's not about the money. - [Steven] Oh, it will be when you notice the money stop coming in. - No, it's about living within your means, you know, making adjustments and making it work. - [Steven] Says every poor person ever. - Okay. Well what are you in it for? You're a pretty big influencer. You've got millions of followers. - [Steven] What do you mean what am I in it for? Fame and fortune baby. - Okay, give me the camera. Okay, Steven Lane, social media influencer, what are your goals? - Well, considering the fact that we're literally in a parallel universe or a time warp or something at this point my only goal is to stay alive. - [Ruby] But when you do make it back home? - Honestly, I think I'm gonna start posting more content. I've been pretty lazy and honestly- - [Ruby] More content? - Well, like I feel like this experience if anything has like taught me that life is like extremely short, and even shorter than I thought, 'cause apparently you can just disappear at any moment. So it's time to make the best of it and just post more, I think. - [Ruby] All right. Well what kind of content are you gonna post? - I don't know. Does it even matter? - [Ruby] I think it does. - Okay well not all of us want to be journalists and report on vegan stories and social justice things. Okay, we can make funny content, you don't have to degrade us for it. - [Ruby] Okay yeah, I guess you're right. - [Steven] Do you think there's a chance that Cali's been waiting in the parking lot for us this whole time? - I hope so. Fuck, that would be amazing. Why do you think she disappeared way before us? - I've been thinking about that. What did she do differently? Okay, I have a plan. We're gonna go around it. We're gonna hug it. We're gonna say nice things to it. We're gonna do anything and everything we can to try to reverse this thing. - Okay. Forgive me tree. We're sorry if we did anything wrong, just please send us back home. Now what? - [Ruby] We try again. - Okay so we just did another lap and whatever we tried didn't work because we're just back at the tree again. - Steven's taking a leak. Honestly, I'm so tired of walking down the same trail through the same bushes I don't even know how many times - Cali? Cali, is that you? Cali? Oh shit. - [Steven] Ruby! - [Ruby] Over here. Steven, I saw her, I saw Cali. She came at me like she wasn't happy to see me. - Cali? Why would she do that? - [Ruby] She must know. - Know what, what we did? - [Ruby] Yeah, about us. Fuck, we fucked up. - Shit. - [Ruby] Let's just keep going. - You just want to keep going, just ignore it and make things weirder? - [Ruby What else are we gonna do? - I don't know. - [Ruby] Fuck. - [Steven] Okay, so you were right there walking in front of me and then you were just transported like 10 feet ahead for like three seconds then you were back here. - What? - [Steven] I don't know you were there and then you were there and then you were back here. - Well did you get out on camera? - [Steven] No. - Wouldn't I notice? - [Steven] I know what I saw. What the fuck? It happened again. - [Ruby] What? - [Steven] You were on this side and then suddenly you're over there. - Are you joking me right now? - [Steven] No, I'm not fucking joking. - Okay, well maybe we're out of sync or something. - [Steven] Oh shit, if you disappear then I'll be in here alone. I can't be in here alone. - Hold on, what did we do differently? - [Steven] We went around the tree. I don't know what we did differently. I said more things to the tree. I said nice things. - Holy shit. - [Steven] What? What? - What way did you go around? - [Steven] Oh fuck, I don't know. - I went around clockwise like this. - [Steven] I went the other way. - Are you sure? - [Steven] Yeah, I totally went the other way. - Okay, well maybe that has something to do with something. - [Steven] Is that what Cali did? - Maybe. I think one of us should go back around again. - [Steven] Okay, who? - Well I've been going around the same way each time. - [Steven] So you want me to go around? - Yeah. - [Steven] But you should go around to get on my level, that's where Cali is. - I don't think that's a good idea. - [Steven] So you're scared of Cali now? - I'm not scared of Cali. I'm scared of being stuck out here forever. - [Steven] You should go around to get on my side. - No, you go around. Please do it before it's too late, before we separate, please. Okay, so we're back at the tree again. Steven's gonna go around the same way that I did. We're pretty sure that whatever way you go around has something to do with which dimension you end up in. - Okay, are you filming? - [Ruby] Yes, hurry. Steven? Steven? Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Steven? No. (crying) No, no. So I'm all alone. And I knew that this would happen eventually. I'm fed up, I'm confused as fuck. At least I have this camera to talk to. It keeps me somewhat sane. I think I heard something. Hello? Steven, oh my God. Steven, where'd you? Steven wait, Steven can you hear me? Steven wait, look at me. What the fuck? What the fuck? (crackling) Guys, guys, can you hear me? Steven, Cali, please, please tell me you can hear me. Please. (crackling) Can you hear me? (crackling) I'm attempting to find the parking lot one last time. I'm all alone. Steven and Cali seem to be in the same dimension now. What's happening here? Everything is glowing. This is so cool. Oh shit. (ethereal buzzing) So I'm feeling really lightheaded. I was glowing and I was by the creek and now I'm here, but I don't know how I got here. I'm feeling really confused. I know I came here, I know I came here to do something but what did I come here to do? I was making a video. I was making a video and I was with Steven and there was someone else with us. Fuck. There was someone else with us. We were with Cali fuck, why'd I forget that Cali was with us? Wait. Where are they? I'm not sure what's going on. I'm gonna go around the tree the same way they did and I'm gonna see what happens. (birds chirping) (mysterious music)
