That little PPP thing you got going on, I need action in it. I'm a good business man. And I pay what I want. Just let me know what I need to do. You know this is my city, man. There ain't nothing I can't get done. But there's only one thing. (ominous music) If this shit goes south, I need you to take full responsibility of this shit.

You can walk your funny looking ass out this door and I'll never see you again or take this money and we can talk about what we need to do next. - Man, I don't know what we going to do. This nigga Nemo got us on this so-called gas. This shit don't even get me high. - I know bro, taste it. I spent my whole bread on that shit. I had four zips bro. I sold that shit in two hours. Dude took one hit of that shit, told everybody. Word got around, I ain't sold shit. - Man, you know it takes only one. Shit, it's been a whole week for me. - Damn, you know what?

He a straight up geek, but he good with computers. - Now what that gotta do with us? You know, I ain't good with computers - Man, wait and let me finish. Dude say right now he's sitting on 40 bands on a PPP loan. - PPP loan, now is you high? I thought you said that shit was CBD. - What you need to hear is you ain't gotta pay it back. Man, we could take that money, hit Tulsa, go get some real gas come back, plug the streets, take a couple hundred off the string. - Like a real player, dude. (laughing) (mysterious music) - Boy, I swear if I ever get the chance to get with Mulatto, I'm gonna make love to her. Man, look at that. Well, well, well. - Hi. - How can I help you? - Oh, you won't be helping me. You'll be helping my husband. (mysterious music) (laughing) - It's a beautiful day to be blessing the Lord. Am I right Lil Dickie? - Yes, pastor. - Now I'm looking for Sean. I'm here to bless him for blessing with the, Sean? (record scratching) Oh, okay, okay. Could I possibly offer you one of my lovely outfits? - Hell no. - No? - Yeah, no, I'm cool. But you can gimme that bread you know that we talked about earlier. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ain't that what, little mustard seeds? - [Lil Dickie] Something like that. - Well you see, things have been a little bit crazy around here if you know what I mean. - Yeah, I mean I understand you pastor but I mean you been getting a lot of heat with that message that you're bringing down there at the church, you know, trying to take the rainbow back from the L G B T Q R S crew. (mysterious music) Man, why is you making it such a big deal about a rainbow? - Look, I'm just here to settle this debt, aight? Now, I got $4,950. Oh and a $50 gift card as well. Now it's $40 on that though. Cause God led me to go get some gas because being filled with God's presence I can't be on E. (spritzing) - These niggas. You know what? You're good pastor. You're good. - I just got one question. Why the suit? Suit, Jericho juice, rainbow flunky. What's up with the suit man? - Well, you see the suit, it made me viral. So this was definitely confirmation to give just this one message. - Which is? - That the rainbow, it belonged to Noah. - [Sean] What? - Clueless. (record scratching) Baby, let's go. Our work with the Lord here is done. How did you, what do. - The ark belonged to Noah, it was Noah's ark not Noah's rainbow, Party City, mother. (patting) - Nice seeing you. - And nice to meet you too, Mrs. Rain. - Hug here. (chiming) Oh yes. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, oh. (spritzing) (ominous chiming) - First ladY, we gots to go.

Why is he dropping off all this cash and why you signing me up for shit we ain't talked about? - Shit that's going around here is opportunity out here to get money and I can't be broke, bro. That shit just ain't gonna cut it bro. You know that shit - I can't get with this. This seems like a trap. This shit dangerous, bro. I had a couple people ask me about it and going forward I'm just sending them straight to you. - And I respect that, you know? Cause I'm be having a lot of people come in here, you know what I'm saying? Dropping off bread. I can cut you in on it, you know what I'm saying? For collecting the money, you know what I'm saying? - It's at least you could do man using my office and shit but why you, why you looking at me like that bro? - I was just thinking man, about the pastor's wife. How she was up hugging on you bro. - Nah bro, nah man, on the, nah for real man like on the real? Females just love and I hug and cuddle on them, bro. Like they'll pay me to do it or some shit like I have a gift. I don't know, I didn't choose this life. - Mr. Cuddler. - [Sean] Yeah. - Mr Cuddler. - [Sean] Mm-hmm. - I gotta get out of here, man.

Do you love your boyfriend? Cause he got a brother, I'm just saying. - Yes, but he don't care about anything I got going on. He say things are gonna get better and change for us, but honestly it's just getting worse. - Worse as in cheating, or being broke? I pray not both, cause if that's the case you better run. - No, he's a good man. Definitely not a cheater. We just broke though. He sell insurance and he do people's taxes (file scrapes ) - Oh, he's one of those. Anyway, look, I'm not trying to come across as a bad influence, but I hate seeing you struggle like this. You don't deserve that. I'm gonna come right out and say it. You need a sugar daddy. (dramatic music) - No, no, I can't. I love Jacob, I love him. He just needs to do better. (ominous music) - I love your big heart, girl but love ain't gonna pay these bills. I'm gonna say this, don't lose your nail shop when you have the power to save it. I know you was raised in the church where they prophesy, but I was raised in the dirt where we profit. (dramatic music) Ooh, girl. - You like them? - Yes.

We had feelings for each other, now we're married. - What a story, sounds like a great couple. - Mm-hmm, thanks, come on back. - All right. - Have a seat. - Thank you. - So what brings you in? - My situation is pertaining to that PPP loan. The feds got my grandpa in jail for taking 2 million for a loan. - Did he spend it? - None of it. - Okay, well that's good. If he still has some money, I can work a better deal. - I gotta be real with you, Mrs. Rain. . My grandpa didn't have nothing to do with this. I did of the loan in his name, my boy Sean, he put the little finishing touches on it and sent it through. He was the only one who had the information to process the loan. - Hmm, why would he do it for $2 million and he has none of it. I mean, this, this could turn out to be expensive. - How much we talking? - I'm thinking close to 10K. I mean you need some quick work done. - Damn, $10,000? I don't have that kind of money, Mrs. Rain. - That's okay, I can take another form of payment. - Like what, you take food stamps? (laughing) - Funny, you know what I mean. - Oh no, no, Mrs. Rain. I can't go down for sleeping with the preacher's wife. That's a one way ticket to hell. - Oh come on, Mr. Cuddler. I'm a woman of God, I have other needs. - Like what? - I lack much affection in my life. You know, my husband, he keeps my other needs where sex is concerned, I'm filled there. I just need a hug. I mean, there's something that you should be aware of. - No, okay, Miss First Lady. Well, I'm listening, I'm all ears, baby. - I've watched you and you're a man of discipline. So I will do your case if you cuddle me for one hour. - What, why? - Like I said, I lack, love and affection. I need that extra touch. I just need to be held. - Wow, okay, okay. Well cuddling with no sex, I can do that. Don't want to do that, but I can do that. - Okay, okay, good. There's just one more thing. - What's up? - So I've been talking to the ladies of the church about you and they also need to blow off a little steam, right? Knock that extra little edge off. So they're willing to also cuddle with you for one hour for $500. - $500 an hour? Hell yeah, I'll cuddle them bi- I mean, absolutely, I'd love to cuddle the members of your congregation. Mrs. Rain. - All right, that's what I like to hear. One more hug. - Yes, one for the road. (chiming) - Seal the deal. - Yeah, press down. Stick it together, on an oath. - Yes. (chiming) (doors slamming) - Lonnie, Lonnie, Lonnie. Thought you was leaving? What's good, nigga? - Nigga, where Sean at? Seem like your boy disappeared. - Is there a problem? - Yeah nigga, we got a problem. - Ain't no problem. - Come on, I ain't got no problem with you, bro. But your boy, he disappeared.

He got a busload of church women lined up for cuddles charging 250 to 1000 depending on the circumstances. (sultry music) - Hmm. - So what if I wanted to cuddle all night? - All night? It would be very costly, Mrs. Jackson, for all night. - Costly, money really is no issue. (coins jingling) - Check your Cash App. - Really? - Okay, all right, all right, all right.

Honorable Matthews presiding. (ominous music) - Please be seated. Will the defendant please rise? Are you the defendant in this case? - Yes. - Please state your name and your age. - Sean Miles Murray I'm 28. - Mr. Murray, you are charged with one count of laundering money and five counts of wire fraud. How do you plead? (ominous music) - Guilty. - Thank you, Mr. Murray. will the prosecuting attorney please state his or her name for the record. - Veronica Getman. - Thank you. Ms. Getman. Will the attorney for the defense please state his or her name for the record. - Clarice Rain, your honor. - Thank you Mrs. Rain. We are ready to proceed with the sentencing portion of our case. The defendant having pled guilty to six counts of criminal information. Specifically the one count of laundering money and five counts of wire fraud in violation of Title 18 United States code sections 1956 and 1343 both of which are felonies. I'll be glad to hear from the government and then from the defense and Mr. Murray, I'll give you the opportunity to address the court. You may be seated for now. Ms. Getman, you may proceed. - Thank you, your honor. Can you please instruct your client to please remove his glasses so we can see into his eyes? - Certainly will the defendant please remove his glasses? - Nobody gotta tell me to do nothing. Don't nobody gotta tell me to do nothing. - Thank you. - Thank you, your honor. The government sentencing is as follows. 60 months for the count of money laundering and 120 months for the five counts of wire fraud with no possibility of parole. And I'd like to explain why this sentencing is appropriate for this case. Mr. Murray is one of the many people who have robbed American small businesses of the opportunity to keep their business open. This man must be held accountable for all of the thefts towards the only help most of these small business owners have had during one of the toughest seasons America has witnessed. Thank you for your time, your honor. - Thank you, Ms. Getman. - Mrs. Rain, I'll be glad to hear from you. - I don't intend to take much of your time. Thank you, your honor. Your honor, I'd like to present that my client has no prior criminal record. The last time he had any run-ins with the law he was a teenager stealing candy. My client understands the errors that he has made and for such Mr. Murray came here today willing and ready to accept the consequences of those actions. Anything that you may see fit, we understand, but we are ultimately asking for a lighter sentencing, knowing that we will honor and respect any sentencing that you pass down. Thank you for your time, your honor. - Thank you Mrs. Rain. Mr. Murray, if you'll please stand. I'll now personally address you to determine if you wish to make a statement and give you the opportunity to speak on your own behalf. Do you wish to make a statement, sir? - Yes. I seen somebody do this before, but they didn't do it the right way with me. - I got this, trust me. - No, I got this. I'm doing this for me. - Okay. - Your honor, I'd like to sing a song. Hello there your honor. I like to say that I'm sorry for the things I've done and I try to be stronger in this life I chose but I want you to know that door I've closed and your honor I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. And to my mother, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. To the small businesses, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. To the taxpayers, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. (cheering) (gavel pounding) - We'll have order in the court. We'll have you fined for contempt if it happens again. Thank you Mr. Murray. Well, you're obviously a talented young man and I hope that you'll use your time productively in the El Dorado State Penitentiary. I hope that you'll take advantage of the programs that they offer so that upon your a release, you can achieve all your goals. Now the court has taken into consideration the nature and the circumstance of the offenses. And I have considered the aggravating and the mitigating factors in determining a sentence case number 6520 third degree, money laundering, one count, 60 months. For wire fraud under section 1343 of title 18 five counts 120 months. Mr. Murray, you should really thank Mrs. Rain. You have a highly favorite attorney representing you today for me to even consider parole. It is here by order that the defendant be incarcerated within the department of corrections for a total of 15 years, with the possibility of parole in seven years, six months. That is this sentence of this court. - What is he paying for, the shoes? Jesus, not like this baby. Come on years on you gonna be right? - 15 years? - Not like this. (dramatic music) - Hold on, so you're telling me, you're taking me to see the real sunshine? Yes, it's something you need to see. (playful music) Keep going. - Take your ass up in there and have a seat. - Hold up, what is going on? You're supposed to trust me. - I don't trust you and why all of a sudden grandpa looking like he don't been healed by Jesus? - God is good. - All the lean over disgusting shit. And I thought you was supposed to be taking me somewhere to meet this girl named Sunshine. - Sis. - Hey, hey bitch. Hello? (playful music) - So serious. - What up, sis? - What is this? You look like. - We twins, my feet are the ain't no ocean, ain't no sea. Not on a serious. What up, sis? Wait a minute, how? Don't tell me how. I don't know, I don't know. - Sis, there's much don't know. Grandpa Smack and Goldie is not the real crooks in this case, trust me. Our so-called brother is the son of the man who controls the whole operation. Without him, this money will be easily traced. You see the guy you sent to prison, he didn't actually run anything. He actually works for me. I knew his ass wasn't Sunshine, it's a damn girl's name. So wait a minute, you're telling me you're Sunshine and wait a minute, is that in on this? This is Judge Matthews' whole operation. Our parents never told you I existed because they thought it was best for us. Mom raised me in the hood with no support of dad, of course, because she was a strong black mom trying to prove something. Get this, mom called us the light twins. You were bright, and I was sunshine. You get it? - Rude. - Mom was a secret because Judge Matthews was married to our brother's mother. One day, Mom drops you off at Judge Matthews' doorstep. And guess who answered the door? His wife, but mom told her everything, everything. And then mom packed me up and we moved to Tulsa. I'm not mad at all, but don't understand why the judge would hide us from each other. I mean he showed up in my life after mom died and decided to do crime with me and played goody goody with you. So wait a minute. Is Tim in all this? No, well, I don't know. I mean, he's a good guy and all, but daddy don't want me talking to him nor you. Dad paid me a lot of money to stay out the way, but we just thought that you just needed to know the truth, but you do know that you take me down and you taking the whole family down. - All us. - Everybody. - All us. - I bet you didn't know that Miss Goldie is our little sister. Dad had a little dark secrets. - Papa was a rollin stone. - But real talk sis, I hate that you have to find out this way, but we all wanna know, what you gonna do? - Little sis, huh? I gotta apologize to you cause after I arrest you, I kind of went back to your house, set fire to all your Indian Remis. - Wait a minute. - Hold on. - Hey, you wasn't even there. - Wait was this the Indian Remi that was mine? - You gave me the (overlapping shouting) - We need to stop talking and start walking. - I just wanna know what you gonna do. - I'll will shoot you. - My pride got in the way, but I've been miserable without you. - Oh baby, me too. Even though it's still hard to believe your missing shoe story. - So we going there, that's what we doing? - Yeah. - Bet, bet. But let's not forget that you gotta missing shoe situation that hasn't been resolved either, right? The truth baby. - It's embarrassing. - Just tell me the truth, baby. That's the only way we gonna heal properly from this. - Okay, look Jacob. For starters, Leonard, he's a weirdo. - Okay, most bald men are. - So he undressed my feet. - Just calm down, Janelle, calm down.

You were turned into a human sundae and just going forward we're gonna keep our toes to ourselves in this relationship that's gonna be our new agreement. Everybody keep they toes to themselves, how about that, huh? - Yeah, well, shut up and take this shoe. One shoe ain't gonna do you no good. Plus it's fake, look at it. - See you outta line.
