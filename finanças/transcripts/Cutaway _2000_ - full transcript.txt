I SAW IT LOADED MYSELF. IMPOSSIBLE OR NOT, THERE AREN'T ANY BOATS THAT CAN MAKE IT HERE THAT FAST THAT LEFT THE HARBOR. THAT LEAVES YOUR PLANE. INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS GOING TO BE ALL OVER YOU. THEY THINK I TIPPED? THEY MANAGED TO GET A COPY OF YOUR LAST SHRINK REPORT. "SUBJECT HAS DIFFICULTY SEPARATING HIS UNDERCOVER WORK FROM HIS TRUE PERSONALITY." VIC, I KNOW YOU'RE OKAY. I KNOW THAT, BUT THE ODDS ARE AGAINST US. THEY GOT MORE MONEY, THEY GOT SMARTER LAWYERS, WE CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL. I JUST WANT TO WIN ONE. - HERE YOU ARE. - THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME.

THIS IS WHERE WE PACK THE CHUTES. EVERY RIG HAS A RESERVE CHUTE FOR EMERGENCIES. EVERY JUMPER ON THIS FIELD WEARS A TOP SPEED RECORDER. IT'S LIKE OUR TRADEMARK. SHOWS HOW FAST WE'RE GOING. OVER HERE, WE'VE GOT HELMETS, JUMPSUITS, EXCUSE ME... I LOVE THIS! THAT'S "BOOM-BOOM." USED TO BE SOME DOCTOR OR LAWYER, BUT TODAY, OFFICIALLY A CUTAWAY. "CUTAWAY"? THAT'S WHEN YOU SELL YOUR HOUSE, QUIT YOUR JOB, AND MOVE OUT HERE TO THE DROP ZONE. GIVE UP EVERYTHING, JUST LIKE THAT? IT'S NOT ABOUT GIVING UP ANYTHING. IT'S ABOUT CUTTING AWAY THE BULLSHIT IN YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOUR MAIN CHUTE FAILS, YOU'VE GOT TO CUT IT AWAY, SO YOU CAN PULL YOUR RESERVE AND SAVE YOURSELF. SO THEN, HE'S SAVING HIMSELF? YEP. - YOU READY TO JUMP? - ME? NO, I'M JUST... YOU KNOW, I'M JUST HERE TO... TO WHAT? - TO JUMP, I GUESS. - CASH DISCOUNT? THAT'LL BE $90. ALL RIGHT. THERE. YOU'RE READY TO GO. "READY TO GO"?

IT'S JUST THAT I'M KIND OF USED TO BEING IN CONTROL. SO AM I. - YEAH? - YEAH. WHO'S THE BLONDE? SHE'S ONE OF OUR PILOTS. SHE'S TURBO'S. - HEY, RUSH! - YEAH? RUSH? VIC.

YES, MA'AM, THAT'S RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A REALLY NICE VIDEO OF YOUR JUMP TO SHOW YOUR FAMILY. THANK YOU. WHEN WE HIT 16,000 FEET, IT'LL BE SUNSET. TAKE THE SHUTTER OFF "AUTO" AND PUT IT ON "MANUAL." IT'S LIKE HE KNOWS EVERYBODY'S JOB BETTER THAN-- HE DOES. - I SAW YOU GET "PIED" TODAY. - THAT WAS GREAT, WASN'T IT? - YEAH. - SURE BEATS WORKING. LEFT, FIVE DEGREES! FIVE DEGREES, NOT 15! BACK TO THE RIGHT! OKAY, OKAY! STAND BY! OKAY, MRS. SHIPLEY, TIME TO TEST YOUR BLADDER CONTROL. HOW LONG BEFORE HE HAS TO PULL THE CORD?

I DON'T WANT TO LET HIM DO THIS ANYMORE! - SET... - I'LL GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK! ...GO! WASN'T THAT LIKE SEX? IF IT WAS, I'VE BEEN DOING IT THE WRONG WAY! MAN, YOU CAN SEE SO MUCH FROM UP HERE! EVERYTHING. WHAT WAS THAT? IT'S JUST RED LINE SHOWING OFF. HE'S CRAZY. THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU. ANYTHING. WHAT THE HELL IS A "WHUFFO"? IT'S A VIRGIN. SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER JUMPED BEFORE. IT COMES FROM, "WHUFFO' YOU JUMP OUTTA DEM PLANES?" IT'S A HELL OF A WAY FOR ME TO LOSE MY VIRGINITY. YOU WERE BORN HERE? YOU'VE BEEN AT THIS DROP ZONE YOUR WHOLE LIFE? NOT MY WHOLE LIFE. I'VE BEEN TO MEETS. - YOU'VE BEEN TO MEETS? - LOTS OF THEM. STAR! MY GRANDMA ALWAYS SAID MY PRINCE WOULD SWEEP ME OFF MY FEET. YOU JUMPED OUT OF A PERFECTLY GOOD AIRPLANE? YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS AIRPLANE. VIC, I TOLD YOU TO REST, TAKE IT EASY. THE BIMINI CASE. I KNOW HOW THEY DID IT. SKYDIVING-- WITH PARACHUTES. - PARACHUTES? - LIKE G.I. JOE. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK HOW YOU KNOW? DID A LITTLE RESEARCH. BRIAN, DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE... MILES OUT TO SEA, WITH 100 POUNDS OF WEIGHT ON YOUR CHEST, AND WITH THESE CHUTES, YOU COULD FLY FOR MILES? AND... OUR LITTLE BLONDE PILOT? I SAW HER PICTURE OUT AT THE DROP ZONE. OKAY, SO, LET ME GUESS. IN ORDER TO SNIFF THIS OUT... YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO UNDERCOVER, AND NATURALLY, YOU'LL NEED SKYDIVING LESSONS. - PROBABLY. - AFTER YOUR "SHRIMPFEST"... I DON'T THINK THE BUREAU'S GONNA WANT TO PAY FOR THIS. THEY DON'T NEED TO. BRIAN, PLEASE... ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS PULL STRINGS WITH THE ARMY. THEY'VE GOT SOME WIND TUNNEL THING OUT THERE. IT'LL HELP ME TRAIN AND LEARN FASTER. GREAT. SO... I'LL LEAVE MY BADGE AND GUN WITH YOU. I'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU SOON. COOPER... WHO ARE YOU GONNA BE THIS TIME? - VIC PEARSON. - SERGEANT DELMIRA. THEY CALL ME "EIGHT." "EIGHT," MEANING THE NUMBER? WE GO BY OUR POSITION IN THE SPEEDSTAR LINEUP. "EIGHT" MEANS "LAST GUY OUT"-- THE BEST. I HEARD YOU WERE IN NEED OF SOME FAST TRAINING. THIS IS THE PLACE. INCOMING! KNOCK THAT SHIT OFF, YOU MAGGOTS! I INVENTED THAT MOVE. VERY IMPRESSIVE. WHAT IS SPEEDSTAR? READY, SET, GO! A NEW COMPETITIVE EVENT IN SKYDIVING. CLOCK STARTS, THE FIRST GUY EXITS THE PLANE... AND ENDS WHEN THE EIGHTH MAN-- THE BEST-- ENTERS THE STAR. - IT'S A RACE. - ONLY IN THIS RACE... THE FINISH LINE IS MADE OUT OF PEOPLE. IF YOU CAN'T STOP-- YOU DIE. THIS MAKES YOU GUYS THE BEST? NO-- I MAKE US THE BEST... AND I'LL MAKE YOU DAMN GOOD, TOO. SO WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO IMPRESS? A GIRL IN MIAMI NAMED STAR. SHE WORKS FOR A GUY NAMED "RED LINE." "RED LINE"? - YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM? - YEAH, I'VE HEARD OF HIM. HE'S AIR MIAMI'S NUMBER EIGHT. OF COURSE, THEY'VE NEVER WON A MEET... BUT A LOT OF CIVILIANS LIKE TO SAY HE'STHE BEST. YOU MEAN, THE BEST IN THE WORLD? THAT'S WHAT THEYSAY. YOU KNOW, THE LEAGUE'S MOST VALUABLE PLAYER, BUT ON A LOSING TEAM. THE FACT IS, THEY LOSE. IN MY BOOK, THAT MAKES HIM A LOSER. STILL, IF YOU CAN FOOL RED LINE... YOU DESERVE AN ACADEMY AWARD. YEAH! THANKS. AT 1000 FEET, YOU SHOULD BE ON YOUR DOWNWIND. 750, YOU SHOULD BE ON YOUR BASE. WE ONCE WERE AS A CHILD INNOCENT IN OUR MINDS KNOWING NO RACE, OR CONCEPT OF TIME BEFORE WE WERE TAUGHT DIFFERENCES OF MANKIND BUT AS LIFE MOVES ON WE SEE OUR INNOCENT MINDS DISAPPEAR LIKE THE SUN IN THE NIGHT TAUGHT SOCIETY'S VIEWS IN OUR LIFE BORN WITH A LOVE FOR ALL MANKIND THINK BACK TO OUR INNOCENT MINDS WE ARE ALL CONNECTED ALL ONE WE ARE ALL CONNECTED ALL ONE ONLY ONE RACE EXISTS WE ARE ALL CALLED "MANKIND" WITH ONE GOD UP ABOVE LOVING ALL OF US THE SAME BORN WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL MIND WE ARE ALL CONNECTED, ALL ONE LET'S RETURN TO OUR RIGHT THAT WE'RE ALL CHOSEN PEOPLE, EVERY ONE OF US EQUAL AND LOVED BY GOD'S LIGHT BORN WITH THIS LOVE FOR MANKIND THINK BACK TO OUR INNOCENT MIND ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL WE'LL FIND LET'S THINK BACK LIKE A CHILD TO OUR INNOCENT MIND WE ARE ALL CONNECTED ALL ONE RUSH!

YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THE MOVES HE WAS MAKING. HIS FIRST SOLO JUMP. NOBODY FREEFALLS LIKE THAT. - FIRST TIME... - RIGHT. I'M SURE. I'M SURE HE'S A PRODIGY IN FREEFALL, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO STEERING... HE STILL NEEDS A LITTLE HELP. BORN WITH THIS LOVE FOR MANKIND THINK BACK TO OUR INNOCENT MINDS FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL WE'LL FIND THINK BACK TO OUR INNOCENT MIND WE'RE ALL BORN WITH THIS LOVE FOR ALL MANKIND THINK BACK LIKE A CHILD TO OUR INNOCENT MIND WE ARE ALL CONNECTED ALL ONE WE ARE ALL CONNECTED ALL ONE ONLY ONE RACE EXISTS... THE FUEL GUY KEEPS CALLING. I THINK HE LIKES YOU. TELL HIM WE'LL PAY HIM NEXT WEEK. ON MY WAY. - THIS IS 80 JUMPS? - TRY 18. - BULLSHIT. - EIGHTEEN? SEE, YOU'RE WAY TOO STIFF. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BUFFETING AROUND LIKE A PIECE OF PLYWOOD, AND YOU'VE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH YOUR LEGS. DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR ARMS IF YOUR LEGS AREN'T WORKING WITH YOU. THIS EARLY IN THE SKYDIVE... YOU GET MORE SPEED FROM THE THROW OF THE PLANE THAN YOU DO FROM THE PULL OF GRAVITY, SO GO WITH IT! ACCEPT IT, THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR RATE OF SPEED. YOU'RE NOT FOCUSING ON STAR, BECAUSE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE GROUND. AT THIS HEIGHT, YOU'VE GOT 40 SECONDS TILL IMPACT. JUST FORGET ABOUT IT. CONCENTRATE ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT. STAR, PRACTICE IS AT 3:00. TILL THEN, FORGET ABOUT THE FUEL BILL. GET HIM STRAIGHTENED OUT. SO MANY THINGS I'M STILL DOING WRONG. IT'S A WONDER I'M NOT DEAD. VIC, YOU DON'T GET IT. RED LINE NEVERTALKS TO STUDENTS, OR CARES ABOUT THEIR DIVES. I MEAN, HE MUST SEE SOMETHING IN YOU. - YEAH? - YEAH. AND WHAT DO YOU SEE? I SEE A COMPUTER CONSULTANT WHOSE VACATION IS ABOUT TO END. THEN WHAT WILL I DO? I DON'T KNOW. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT. IF I WERE SMART, I'D HAVE ALREADY CALLED MY BOSS AND ASKED FOR SOME MORE VACATION TIME. WHEN WERE YOU GONNA TELL ME? AS SOON AS YOU ASKED. "18 JUMPS," MY ASS. YOU'LL NEVER BE ONE OF US, BROTHER. I'M TALKING TO YOU, MAN! I'LL SEE YOU ON THE FLIGHT LINE. YOU'RE LATE. ALL THEY DO IS SKYDIVE. I MISS ONE JUMP, THEY'LL THINK I'M AN OUTSIDER. YOU ARE AN OUTSIDER. DON'T FORGET THAT. NAME'S RANDY KINGSTON. HE'S GOT TWO PRIORS, LAST ONE, DRUGS. - WHAT ELSE? - THAT'S IT, TILL I GET INSIDE. "INSIDE"? YOU'VE DRAWN SO MUCH CASH, YOU COULD OPEN YOUR OWN DROP ZONE. EVEN THEN, I'D STILL NEED MORE. IT'S AN EXPENSIVE SPORT, BRIAN. THERE'S NO MONEY IN THE DROP ZONE BUSINESS. HALF OF THESE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN HAVE JOBS. THE MONEY'S COMING FROM SOMEWHERE. I JUST NEED SOME MORE TIME. I NEED TO GET CLOSER TO TURBO. "TURBO"? THAT'S KINGSTON, BUT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT. WELL, KNOW THIS-- YOU ARE JUMPING TO WORK THE CASE, YOU ARE NOT WORKING THE CASE TO JUMP, SO-- YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK OUT THERE... YOU'RE GONNA GET INSIDE, WHEREVER THAT IS, AND DO IT QUICKLY. VIC. IT'S LATE. I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU. - WHAT'S IN THE BAG? - MY LIFE. - I'M CUTTING AWAY. - OH, MY GOD. OKAY... OKAY, EVERYBODY! REMEMBER TO TIE THE PLANE DOWN BEFORE THE BEER FRONT MOVES IN, AND BE SET AT 6:00 AM FOR TEAM CALL. PEARSON... YOU'RE IN AT ONE. YOU GO! HOW YOU GUYS CAN PRACTICE THIS EARLY... AFTER A PARTY LIKE THAT, I DO NOT KNOW. PARTY? IT WAS MORE LIKE A CHURCH SOCIAL. EVERYONE WALKED HOME UNDER THEIR OWN POWER, SO IT WASN'T A REAL PARTY. READY! SET! GO! WHERE DID YOU DISAPPEAR TO LAST NIGHT? I SLEPT ON THE PLANE. I DON'T REMEMBER TOO MUCH, BUT DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG? YOU'RE ON THE TEAM. SO? IT MEANS WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M THE FIRST WOMAN EVER TO BE ON A SPEEDSTAR TEAM. A GOOD ONE, AT LEAST. RED LINE GAVE ME A CHANCE... WHAT'S RED LINE GOT TO DO WITH THIS? HE GAVE ME A CHANCE NO GIRL'S EVER HAD BEFORE. PART OF THE DEAL IS NO ROMANCE WITH TEAMMATES. LOOK... IF YOU WANT TO DO THE TEAM... DON'T "DO" THE TEAM. READY! SET! GO! - I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. - VIC, DON'T START. YOU'RE ON THE TEAM. YOU DEAL WITH IT. - LOOK AT BOOM-BOOM. - WHAT ABOUT HIM? DO THE MATH. THERE ARE EIGHT SLOTS ON A SPEEDSTAR TEAM. IF YOU'RE ON, SOMEBODY ELSE IS OFF. THIS TEAM MEANS EVERYTHING TO HIM. IT'S WHY HE CUT AWAY HIS OLD LIFE. AND NOW HE'S ON THE BENCH. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. RED LINE WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU JUST BACKED OUT. I'M NOT QUITTING. IT'S A DASH 7 SKYVAN. WHAT? SMART! SAME MODEL AIRCRAFT AS IN THE NATIONALS. BETTER THAN THAT. IT ISTHE AIRCRAFT FROM THE NATIONALS. NOW WE GOT THE HOME COURT ADVANTAGE, WE CAN BEAT THOSE ARMY RAT BASTARDS AT THEIR OWN GAME! RED, THIS IS COOL, BUT... BUT WHAT? - CAN WE AFFORD THIS? - LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT. OKAY? WHAT DID THIS BABY SET YOU BACK? JUST REMEMBER TO HOLD YOUR HEADING, AND KEEP A STEADY FALL RATE, EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT. - I KNOW WHAT TO DO. - SURE YOU DO. ONLY THIS TIME, YOU'LL HAVE ALL OF US COMING FULL TILT. THAT TAKES CONCENTRATION, TOTAL COMMITMENT-- NOT JUST FROM HERE-- BUT FROM HERE. LINE IT UP! READY... SET... GO! GOOD TIME. HOLD IT... ALL RIGHT! HE'S GOT SOMETHING. I KNOW THAT MUCH. HOW DO YOU KNOW? SAME WAY I KNEW WITH YOU. GIMME. HOW'D WE DO? SOMEBODY GOT IN LATE, BUT YOU STILL DID AN 18.4. YOU THINK THE ARMY ISN'T DOING 18s? WE'RE SO SLOW, THEY'LL BE GIVING US PARKING TICKETS. JESUS. OKAY, PEOPLE... TOMORROW, FASTER... SAME TIME, SAME CHANNEL. OH, AND, CAL? YEAH? I WANT YOU TO BRIEF VIC ON THE NUMBER TWO SLOT. YOU TWO ARE TRADING PLACES TOMORROW. SORRY, BRO'. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. NO, YOU DON'T. - YEAH, I DO. - NO, YOU DON'T. - CAL... - DON'T. JUST DON'T. THAT MAKES TWO YOU'VE BLOWN AWAY. ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? GIVE ME A BREAK. CAL SCREWED UP, NOT ME. SATELLITE NAVIGATION. BIMINI. HEY, BOYS. WHAT'S UP? WHAT? WHAT? KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY? YOU TWO ARE GONNA SIT UP ALL NIGHT, AND BITCH ABOUT ME, THEN WAKE UP TOMORROW AT DAWN, AND LET RED LINE DUMP ALL OVER YOU. NO, NO. HE DOESN'T DUMP ON US. IT'S RED LINE THAT BENCHES THIS GUY OR PROMOTES THAT GUY. SAYS WHO'S FAST, AND WHO'S SLOW? - NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. - IT IS, KID. THE QUESTION IS, WHY DO YOU PUT UP WITH IT? TO WIN. YOU'VE COME UP SO FAST, YOU DON'T SEE THE BIG PICTURE. WE KNOW RED LINE IS DIFFERENT. HE GETS US TO DO THINGS WE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE. LIKE WHAT? LIKE CUTTING AWAY. I WAS A LAWYER, A GOOD LAWYER. I STARTED OUT WITH ALL THESE IDEALS... I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA CHANGE THE WORLD. IT WASN'T ABOUT IDEALS, IT WAS ABOUT PUTTING A SHOW ON FOR THE JURY... MAKING THE OTHER SIDE LOOK BAD, AND FOR WHAT? TO CUT A DEAL? MAKES YOU FORGET WHY YOU'RE DOING IT, KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? LET ME TELL YOU A STORY. ONE DAY, I WALK INTO THIS MEETING. A CASE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR MONTHS. CLIENTS FROM BOTH SIDES ARE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TABLE. THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME, WAITING FOR ME TO SIT DOWN... AND WHAT? I COULDN'T REMEMBER WHICH SIDE I WAS ON. SEE, OUT HERE WITH RED LINE, IT'S ALL CLEAR. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND WHY. IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE SOMETIMES, BUT IT'S ALL CRYSTAL CLEAR. BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE. NOT REALLY. I'LL SHOW YOU. SEE, SPEEDSTARS FALL IN A RANDOM PATTERN. THEY ZIGZAG. YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS. EVEN MORE CHAOTICALLY AS EACH GUY HITS. NOW SEE, YOUR BIG GUNS, ESPECIALLY DELMIRA-- DELMIRA? ARMY'S EIGHTH GUY. RED LINE CAN'T STAND HIM. ANYWAY, THE OTHER GUYS WILL CHASE AFTER THE FORMATION IN A SNAKE-LIKE COURSE LIKE THIS. VERY INEFFICIENT. BUT RED LINE-- AND THIS IS PURE GENIUS-- SOMEHOW KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE THE FORMATION IS GOING AND FLIES IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO THAT POINT. HOW DOES HE KNOW? WELL, THAT IS THE QUESTION, ISN'T IT? CAL'S WRITING HIS THESIS ON THIS. DISSERTATION. FUCKING Ph.D. FROM M.I.T. BESIDES, WHO DO YOU THINK PAYS FOR OUR JUMPS? - I PAY FOR MY OWN. - YEAH, UNTIL YOU'RE BROKE. THEN RED LINE WILL PAY FOR YOU LIKE HE PAYS FOR US. I THOUGHT TURBO WAS THE GUY WITH ALL THE MONEY. TURBO, RED LINE, SAME THING. LET'S GO. I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY. OOH-HH... AN EMBARRASSING MOMENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. AN AIRBALL FROM THE GREAT VIC COOPER. COULD IT BE HE'S RUSTY FROM BEING OUT OF TOUCH SO LONG? SO...? TURBO'S GOT ALL THE NIGHT GEAR, AND HE'S GOT THE TALENT. OKAY, TERRIFIC. THE PIECES FIT... WE'RE GONNA PUT A TAIL THIS TURBO AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE HIM DOWN ON HIS NEXT DROP. YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME YOU FEEL SORRY FOR THIS DOPE SMUGGLER? NEED I REMIND YOU, THAT STUFF ENDS UP IN SCHOOLS? I'M TIRED OF TAKING DOWN THE LITTLE GUY. LITTLE? THIS IS A MAJOR MULE. HE'S JUST GONNA GET REPLACED, BRIAN... BY SOME OTHER SKYDIVER, OR SCUBA DIVER, OR WHATEVER. EITHER WAY, THOSE DROPS ARE GONNA GET MADE. THIS IS OUR JOB. D.E.A. FRIES THE BIG FISH. D.E.A. NEVER HAD A CHANCE LIKE THIS. LIKE WHAT? IF I CAN GET IN ON THESE DROPS... I WILL I.D. EVERY LAST DISTRIBUTOR. BRIAN, TO KEEP UP THE TRAINING PACE TAKES A LOT OF CASH. SO THE DROPS ARE GONNA START HAPPENING MORE AND MORE. BY THE NATIONALS, WE COULD SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE OPERATION. GOD HELP ME FOR ASKING THIS, BUT... HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GET IN ON THESE DROPS? I GOTTA GET CLOSER. TAKE A LOOK AT YOURSELF, OKAY? LESSONS WEREN'T ENOUGH. TO GET CLOSER, YOU HAD TO IMPRESS THE TEACHER. NOW YOU'RE ON THE TEAM AND YOU'RE STILL NOT CLOSE ENOUGH. THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS. OKAY, FINE. HEY. HEY! I'M GOING TO BACK YOU ON THIS. BUT I AM BACKING VIC COOPER. NO THAT OTHER GUYS IN THERE. FASTER. FASTER! FASTER! BETTER GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE SOMEONE CATCHES US. YOU'RE GOING THIRD TOMORROW. BE READY. NUMBER THREE... WE NEED TO TALK. IF THE MAN SAYS YOU'RE FASTER, THEN YOU MUST BE FASTER. I MEAN, THE PROBLEM IS IS YOU STILL GOT YOUR, YOU KNOW-- YOU STILL GOT YOUR OWN AGENDA. I MEAN, YOU STILL GOT SOME WHUFFO ISSUE LEFT, MAN. I MEAN, WE CAN HEAR IT. IT'S JUST NAGGING AT YOU. NAGGING. NAG, NAG, NAG... YEAH, YEAH. BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. NOT UNLESS YOU JUMP IN WITH BOTH FEET. SINCE I CUT AWAY, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN READY TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. LEGAL, ILLEGAL. ILLEGAL? THIS ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND. WHAT COULD BE MORE OF A RUSH THAN SPEEDSTARS? OH, GOD, YOU DIDN'T JUST DO THAT, VIC! HOLY SHIT! IT'S A LITTLE STRONGER THAN COFFEE, ISN'T IT? ARMY JUST DID A 16. AND THEIR NUMBER THREE HIT 160. THAT MEANS YOU ARE OUR WEAK LINK, VIC. - I'LL GO FASTER. - I KNOW YOU WILL. I WANT YOU AND STAR TO GO BACK AFTER THE JUMPS, AND DO SUB-TERMINAL DRILLS UNTIL DARK... AT LEAST. MY FRIEND, TODAY YOU CAN HAVE MY SLOT. AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING TODAY. I MEAN EVERY DAY, UNTIL YOU BREAK 165. RED LINE... YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS WANNA PLAY? THEN YOU'RE GONNA PAY. ON THE FLIGHT LINE IN 30. - HOW DID HE KNOW? - RADAR. I MEAN 30 SECONDS. GO! CONTROL MY TINIEST MOTIONS WITHHOLD MY SIMPLEST NEEDS I WISH YOU WEREN'T THIS CLOSE NOW... I WISH YOU DIDN'T SUCCEED READY, SET, GO! DANCING ON A THIN LINE CONTROL MY TINIEST MOTIONS WITHHOLD MY SIMPLEST NEEDS I WISH I DIDN'T NEED YOU NOW... I WISH YOU DIDN'T NEED ME AND I HATE YOU BUT YOU NEED ME AND I NEED YOU AND I NEED...

DAMNED IF YOU AREN'T THE HUNGRIEST SON OF A BITCH I EVER JUMPED WITH. - NO MORE DETENTION? - NO. BUT IT PAID OFF BIG, DIDN'T IT, STAR? IN THE PAST EIGHT DAYS, YOU'VE CLOCKED YOUR BEST TIMES. THAT'S WHY YOU'LL BE THE FASTEST NUMBER THREE IN THE NATIONALS. YOU'RE AT FOUR, VIC. DON'T FUCK UP. WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT? YOU'LL BE NEXT. THAT'S NOT FUNNY. YEAH, IT IS. IT'S PRETTY FUNNY. HEY! HEY! GOD, THAT WAS BETTER! NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO DIRECT YOUR MOMENTUM, JUST LET YOURSELF GO INTO THE GRIP. YES, I FEEL IT. IT'S EASY! "EASY"? YOU HEAR THIS COCKY BASTARD? COCKY IS GOOD, BUT REMEMBER... THE ARMY ALREADY KNOWS THE STUFF YOU'RE LEARNING, - AND MORE. - HOW CAN WE BEAT THEM? VIC-- BY WANTING IT MORE. I DO. RIGHT ON. ASS KISSER. BROWNNOSER. NOSE ASSER. BROWN KISSER. ASS NOSER. - WHAT'S UP? - OH, YOU WANT SOME OF THIS? I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT NOW. YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME? YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M STARTING TO GET THE FEEL OF IT. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? ANY DAY NOW, I'M GONNA BLOW BY THOSE GUYS BACK THERE. I KNOW IT. DON'T LET IT GO TO YOUR HEAD OR ANYTHING. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'RE ABOUT TO START THE SECOND RACE OF THE EVENING. ALL BETTING WINDOWS ARE NOW CLOSED. HEY, BOSS... YOU EVER HEAR THE EXPRESSION, "YOU STAND OUT LIKE A SKYDIVER AT THE DOG TRACK"? I KNOW. LOOK... THIS IS ME RIGHT NOW. WHAT ABOUT KINGSTON? THE BLONDE PILOT MAY NOT BE HIS ONLY ACCOMPLICE. TURBO'S FIRST DRUG ARREST... IT WAS SMALL, SO HE'S SMALL TIME. WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT? A FEELING... RED LINE JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE TYPE. HE'S GOT NO RECORD, YET HE'S THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING. HE'S THE ONE THAT MAKES THINGS HAPPEN. RED LINE? YOU TOLD ME HE LIVES LIKE A BUM. MAYBE SO... OR MAYBE, LIKE A MONK, OR A KNIGHT ON A CRUSADE. I DON'T KNOW. OKAY, LOOK. WHOEVER IT IS, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. I'M OUT. I GOTTA FLY. CAN YOU COLLECT THIS WINNER FOR ME? YOU BET ON NUMBER EIGHT? EIGHT'S ALWAYS THE FASTEST. VIC KEEPS GETTING FASTER AND FASTER. I DON'T KNOW. WHATEVER HE LEFT BACK IN THE WORLD HAS GOT HIM FIRED UP. YEAH, BUT... HE'S GONE AS FAR AS HE CAN GO, RIGHT? THIS IS ABOUT ME AND YOU. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE STOPWATCH, RIGHT? WE HAVE OUR OWN THING. RED LINE? RED LINE! YOU CAN'T GIVE HIM MY SLOT, MAN! PACK 'EM UP. CAL, WHAT WAS OUR TIME ON THAT LAST ONE? 15.15. PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WE'VE BEEN DOING ALL WEEK. NO DENYING IT. WE'RE STUCK AT 15. - ARMY HAS NEVER DONE A 15. - NEVER HAD TO! WE SHOW THEM 15s, THEY'LL SHOW 14s SURE AS SHIT. - WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO? - ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO... LINE IT UP! ONLY WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE... MAKE IT AN EVEN RACE. LETTING YOUR TWO HOTSHOTS GO ALL OUT... IF THEY CAN'T STOP, THE REST OF US GET CREAMED! IT'S THIS OR LOSE! - THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. - HE'S NOT DOCKING ON YOU.

PRACTICE TOMORROW AT DAWN. WHY IS EVERYBODY DOWN ON ME? TURBO DID THIS TO HIMSELF. YOU AND RED LINE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT? THE PARAMEDIC SAID HIS NECK WAS BROKEN IN THE COLLISION. HE WANTED TO BEAT ME SO BAD, HE RISKED HIS OWN LIFE... - AND EVERYBODY ELSE'S. - AND YOU WOULDN'T? I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE PRESSURE AT THE BACK OF THE LINEUP. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BACK OF THE LINEUP? HE WOULD HAVE QUIT ANYWAY... ONCE I MADE YOU NUMBER SEVEN. JUST A MATTER OF TIME. DID YOU SEE THE TAPE? YOU MADE IT IN UNDER 10. YOU SAVED MY LIFE. VIC... SUB-10? I'D SAY THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID IN THE OLD DAYS ABOUT SUB-20... UNTIL I BLEW THAT ALL TO HELL. ME AND TURBO, THAT IS. - HOW DID YOU DO IT? - CUTTING EVERYTHING ELSE AWAY. SCHOOL... FRIENDS, FAMILY... I MEAN, HOW DID YOU CATCH HIM? I WAS GOING BALLS OUT-- YOU BLEW BY ME LIKE I WAS STANDING STILL. THE ONLY THING HOLDING YOU BACK IS FEAR. FEAR OF WHAT? DYING. YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF DYING? NO, I AM... BUT I'M MORE AFRAID OF SOMEONE BLAZING BY ME. LOOK HERE... YOU'RE MY NUMBER SEVEN NOW. THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES WITH THAT. YEAH, I KNOW. DRILL THE TEAM, CHECK THE GEAR... NO, ANYONE CAN DO THAT CRAP. WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS BEING MY PARTNER... IN EVERYTHING. LEADING THE TEAM, GETTING THEM READY FOR THE MEET EMOTIONALLY, FINANCIALLY-- ESPECIALLY FINANCIALLY. KEEPING THIS TOGETHER TAKES MORE MONEY THAN YOU'D EVER DREAM OF. WHATEVER IT TAKES. THERE'S NO MONEY FOR THE NATIONALS. WHAT? IF WE DON'T GET SOME QUICK CASH, WE LOSE. HOW DO WE GET SOME QUICK CASH?

AND THAT'S WHY I WILL ALWAYS BE THE FASTEST. ABOUT THIS ACCIDENT YESTERDAY... THE COUNTY SAYS YOU WERE INVOLVED. JUST MAKE SURE THAT REPORT DOESN'T SAY THAT TURBO AND I WERE RACING WHEN HE BOUNCED. KINGSTON? YOU KILLED YOUR FREAKING TARGET? - ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? - HE WAS NEVER THE TARGET. IT WAS RED LINE ALL THE TIME. I'M IN. - IN THE PIPELINE? - RIGHT ON. OKAY, GREAT.

THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T STOP US. "US"? I MEAN, THEM. - "THEM"? - LOOK... YOU WIRE ME UP, AND WE WILL SHUT THEM DOWN. FORGET ABOUT ALL THE PHYSICAL STUFF. THE MECHANICS STAR TAUGHT YOU MAKE HER A GOOD NUMBER FOUR, BUT THEY CAN'T MAKE YOU A GREAT NUMBER SEVEN. - CAL SAYS... - CAL DOESN'T KNOW. IT ISN'T IN ONE OF HIS BOOKS. SO WHAT IS IT, A ZEN THING? I DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT ZEN... BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE TRICKS YOU LEARN. IT'S ABOUT HOW MANY OTHER THINGS YOU CAN CUT AWAY. WHAT'S LEFT? BESIDES THE GOLD MEDAL? WHEN I KNOW... YOU'LL KNOW. THAT WAS SO FAST. IT WAS FAST. I JUST REALIZED HOW GOOD IT FEELS TO BE PUSHED AGAIN. I'LL PUSH YOU EVEN FURTHER IF YOU TELL ME HOW. LIKE WHEN YOU CAUGHT TURBO THAT DAY. CAN YOU TEACH ME TO GO THAT FAST? I HOPE SO. 'CAUSE THEN I GET TO GO EVEN FASTER. WHERE ARE YOU? Here. We're making another drop tomorrow. WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS? YOU CALL ME FROM UNDERCOVER? The roof of the Second Street Bank, nine o' clock. Are you okay? WEARING THE WIRE HELPS. IT KEEPS ME CONNECTED... TO THE JOB, AND TO YOU. BUT I'M CONNECTED HERE, TOO. Sounds to me like you're in over your head, Vic. STAR. THE TEAM. THIS WHOLE THING. IT'S LIKE I JUST CAN'T WIN. THERE IT IS AGAIN. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERFERENCE, BUT IT'S NOT. THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE AT THAT PARTY WEARING A WIRE. THERE'S NO DELIVERY HAPPENING HERE. This party's clean. Tell the team to relax. I'M TELLING YOU, TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT. GENTLEMEN... CHECK IT OUT. - I ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY THAT. - TRY WHAT? IT ISGOING DOWN. ROOFTOP! GO, GO, GO! WE WIN THE NATIONALS TOMORROW, GET A SPONSOR, WE WON'T HAVE TO DO THIS ANY MORE.

EASY, EASY... OPEN. THAT'S A POLICE LINE. DON'T CROSS IT. - ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - WHAT DO YOU CARE? - I CARE. - GOT A FUNNY WAY OF SHOWING IT. I STILL GOT MY COVER. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. NO, KID, THE COVER'S GOT YOU. AND I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER THING... I'M YOUR PARTNER. THAT'SWHAT MATTERS. THAT SON OF A BITCH WAS POINTING A GUN AT ME. - LISTEN-- - I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT! THEY ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW... ROUNDING UP YOUR BUYERS. I'M GOING OUT TO THE AIR STRIP TO PICK UP YOUR MAN. I'LL GO. TO DO WHAT... SKYDIVE? TO MAKE THE ARREST. RED'S OUT COLD. WHATEVER YOU GAVE HIM HELPED. HE'LL BE OKAY. HOW ABOUT YOU? - I'VE BEEN BETTER. - I'M GLAD... WE'RE ALL GLAD THAT IT'S OVER. - YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT "IT" IS. - I KNOW... I'M JUST SORRY YOU GOT CAUGHT UP IN IT. - BESIDES, NEXT YEAR... - THERE ISN'T GONNA BE A NEXT YEAR. YOU'RE QUITTING? SKYDIVING, YEAH... BUT NOT YOU. COME WITH ME. LET'S TRY SOMETHING ELSE. YOU MEAN SOMETHING ELSE YOU CAN QUIT ON? NO WAY. I'D FOLLOW YOU ANYWHERE, EVEN AWAY FROM HERE AND RED LINE, BUT NEVER TO QUIT. YOU MADE A COMMITMENT TO THIS THING JUST LIKE ALL OF US. IF YOU COULD CUT AWAY SO EASILY, THEN MAYBE YOU'D CUT AWAY FROM ME, TOO. GO AHEAD AND QUIT. YEAH, VIC, JUST QUIT. I MEAN... YOU COULD TRY. GOD KNOWS I'VE BEEN TRYING EVER SINCE THE DAY I STARTED. EVERYONE THINKS I LOVE THIS LIFE, THAT I CHOSE THIS. WHO WOULD CHOOSE THIS? IT'S A GODDAMN CURSE. YOU KNOW-- YEAH, YOU KNOW. YOU TELL HER. TELL HER. TELL HER HOW THERE'S NOTHING REAL FOR YOU BACK IN THE WORLD. ONLY THISIS REAL. TURBO TOOK THE ONLY WAY OUT. - ARE WE PACKED FOR THE MEET? - YEAH. EVERYTHING'S IN THE PLANE, BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT? - GO GET STAR. - HOW CAN WE-- - HOW CAN WE GO? - MOVE YOUR ASS, NOW! YOU GUYS GET RED LINE. HURRY UP. ARE WE A SPEEDSTAR TEAM? LET'S SEE SOME SPEED! GO! WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY? ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER. OH, YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS. HE CAN BARELY WALK. IF I PUT A STAR IN FRONT OF HIM HE'LL HIT IT. WHAT DO YOU SAY, RED LINE? YOU'RE NOT GONNA QUIT ON ME, ARE YOU? GET HIM ON THERE, BOYS. LET'S GO. CAL. HOW ABOUT YOU? HI, ONCE AGAIN, EVERYONE. I'M BURT CAMPBELL, WELCOMING YOU TO THE 1-800-SKYDIVE NATIONAL SKYDIVING CHAMPIONSHIPS HERE IN BEAUTIFUL MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA. BUCKLE UP, KIDS, BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE THE TOP ATHLETES IN THE WORLD'S FASTEST SPORT-- SKYDIVING. ON HAND TO HELP ME CALL THE ACTION-- MY BROADCAST PARTNER, HE IS A FOUR-TIME WORLD FREEFALL CHAMPION, CRAIG LEWIS. THE QUESTION EVERYBODY'S GONNA ASK FROM THE OUTSET... JUST HOW FAST DO THESE GUYS-- AND THESE GALS-- REALLY FALL? BURT, THINK OF IT AS RACING AT THE INDY 500, BUT WITHOUT THE CAR. AMAZINGLY FAST. LET'S ALSO POINT OUT THINGS ARE GOING TO GET EVEN FASTER LATER ON, WHEN THE SPEEDSTAR COMPETITION GETS UNDER WAY, RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT, BURT. THOUGH THE CROWD HERE LOVED THE PARACHUTE STACKING AND THE FREESTYLE EVENTS FOR THEIR BEAUTY AND PRECISION, IT'S THE SPEEDSTARS THAT GET THEIR ADRENALINE PUMPING. THERE'S A BIG KEY TO THIS EVENT WE HAVE TO POINT OUT. IT HAS LONG BEEN DOMINATED BY THE U.S. ARMY PARACHUTE TEAM, THE GOLDEN KNIGHTS. CRAIG, WE UNDERSTAND THAT IN PRACTICE FOR THIS EVENT, THE GOLDEN KNIGHTS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY TURNING IN NEAR RECORD TIMES OF UNDER 13 SECONDS. - THAT IS STUNNING. - THAT IS AMAZING, AND IF THAT'S TRUE, THERE ARE RECORDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE BROKEN HERE TODAY. BREAK OUT THE RECORD BOOKS, GO AHEAD AND LOOSEN UP, AND GET READY TO TAKE THE PLUNGE. THE 1-800-SKYDIVE NATIONAL SKYDIVING CHAMPIONSHIPS, RIGHT HERE. OH, SHIT. PEARSON! PEARSON! WAIT UP! LOOK AT YOU. HOW ARE YA? HOW ABOUT DOWN IN MIAMI? THEY BELIEVE YOU'RE A SKYDIVER YET? I AM A SKYDIVER. WHAT I MEAN IS, WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT? THAT AIR MIAMI IS GONNA KICK YOUR ASS, BITCH. WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TO TALK TO ME THAT WAY? HE'S MY NUMBER SEVEN, THAT'S WHO HE IS. - YUP. - YOUR NUMBER SEVEN? YOU SON OF A BITCH. WHAT HAPPENED TO TURBO? DEAD! ALL RIGHT, GET OUT OF HERE, RED LINE. GET HIM OUT OF HERE, GROUND RUSH. GO ON, GO. SURPRISE. I DIDN'T TEACH YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW. WHAT HAPPENED TO TURBO? HE WAS A LITTLE TOO SLOW... SO WE KILLED HIM. YOU'RE GONNA LOSE! YOU'RE A LOSER! CAL... RED LINE, RED LINE! OUR PLANE IS OVER THERE. COME ON, THIS IS THE WRONG TEAM. WE'RE BACK, AND IT'S ROUND ONE. THE MICHIGAN SQUAD LEADING OFF AGAINST THE 1-800 TEAM. VERY SMOOTH, FOR A PAIR OF YOUNGER TEAMS, CRAIG. NO DOUBT, BURT. YOU DON'T GET TO THE NATIONALS UNLESS ALL EIGHT JUMPERS MOVE AS ONE-- LIKE PARTS OF A SINGLE BODY. LIKE THEY'RE SHARING THE SAME BRAIN. READY! SET! GO! TROUBLE ON THE EXIT, BURT. THEIR LAST MAN WAS SLOW COMING OUT THE DOOR. THAT WILL HURT THEM THIS ROUND. THAT'S A TOUGH BREAK FOR THE MIAMI TEAM, CRAIG. WHOA! LOOK AT HIM GO! IT'S THAT OUT-OF-NOWHERE ACCELERATION THAT MADE RED LINE A LEGEND. LIKE YOU SAY, YOU SEE IT, BUT YOU JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT. THAT'S 12.66. 12.66! I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU, IF THIS KEEPS UP, THAT UPSET THAT EVERYBODY HAS LONG HOPED FOR COULD BE RIGHT HERE IN THE OFFING TODAY. IF AIR MIAMI BUILT THEIR STAR IN NEAR RECORD TIME, AND THIS IS ONLY ROUND ONE, THAT'S NOT BAD CONSIDERING AFTER A RECENT FATALITY THAT THEY HAD TO REPLACE A TEAM MEMBER. IF THEY KEEP THAT INTENSITY IN THE REMAINING ROUNDS, THEY COULD RUN AWAY WITH THIS THING. THAT WOULD BE JUST FINE WITH THIS CROWD, CRAIG. ARE THESE FANS PUMPED UP, OR WHAT? THEY ARE, AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY LOVE RED LINE, THEY'RE SEEING HISTORY WITH THAT SCORE, AND THEY KNOW IT. YOU CAN BET THE ARMY IS OUT TO MAKE MILITARY HISTORY TODAY, AND THEY TAKE NO PRISONERS. IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S CHARACTERIZED THE ARMY'S WINNING STREAK UP TO NOW, IT'S THAT TOUGH COMPETITION BRINGS OUT THE BEST IN THESE GUYS. YOU WON'T SEE THEM CHOKE, THAT'S FOR SURE. THERE THEY GO! TALK US THROUGH IT, CRAIG. GLAD TO, BURT. THE GOLDEN KNIGHTS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR CRISP, CLEAN, MILITARY PRECISION. IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO WIN, THEY HAVE TO LOOK GOOD DOING IT. HERE'S THEIR NUMBER EIGHT! UNBELIEVABLE! 12.65 SECONDS! PURE PERFECTION, BURT! THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY! IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS! HEARD THAT! AT THE END OF ROUND ONE, - THE FAMOUS DELMIRA DISCIPLINE... - SHIT! ...GIVING THE GOLDEN KNIGHTS A NARROW LEAD. THAT RAT BASTARD! I HATE HIM! WELL, AT LEAST HE'S BACK TO NORMAL. JUST IN TIME. AIR MIAMI, ROUND TWO. IT'S ALL EYES IN THE SKY IN ROUND TWO, AS THE CROWD HOLDS THEIR BREATH FOR AIR MIAMI. GOOD EXITS... SMOOTH APPROACHES... COME ON, WATCH YOUR CONTROL. OOH! THEIR SEVENTH MAN HIT HARD! YOU KNOW THEY'RE FEELING THAT! 12.39! A GOOD SCORE, BUT STILL SOME TROUBLE THERE. YES, BURT. THESE JUMPERS ARE PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS. INSTEAD OF FLARING THEIR BODIES EARLY TO SLOW DOWN AND DOCK, THEY'RE FLARING AT THE LAST POSSIBLE SECOND. THE LAST TWO MEN SLAM INTO THE STAR SO HARD, THEY ALMOST TEAR IT APART. IT'S BRUTAL PUNISHMENT FOR THE GUYS ON THE RECEIVING END. IN FACT, THEY ALREADY HAVE A STRAGGLER, BURT. EXACTLY. WELL SHORT OF THE LANDING ZONE, TOO. LOOKS LIKE AN AIR MIAMI JUMPER SHAKEN UP. YOU OKAY? YOU ALMOST PULLED MY ARM OUT. YOU TWO ARE FLYING LIKE MANIACS. LET ME SEE IT-- TRY TO REMEMBER YOU'RE PART OF A TEAM! STILL ROUND TWO, AS THE ARMY FIGHTS TO HOLD THEIR LEAD. IT'S A FIGHT, ALL RIGHT. THE GIVEAWAY IS THAT THE ARMY IS NOT LOOKING SO PRETTY. THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO BE, AT THESE SPEEDS. IT'S ALL YOU CAN DO JUST TO DOCK IN YOUR SLOT. HOLY SH-- SHAVING CREAM, BURT! A 12.22! HOLD ON A SECOND-- THEY STILL HAVE TO HOLD THAT FORMATION FOR A FULL FIVE SECONDS TO KEEP THAT SCORE. THIRD ROUND IS UNDERWAY AS THE ARMY LEADS OFF. AND THEY ARE FLYING VERY TIGHT. THEY'RE CLOCKING A RECORD-BREAKING PACE HERE! THAT'S SIX, AND SEVEN... HERE'S DELMIRA-- OOH! - DELMIRA MISSES IT! - THAT WILL COST HIM. WITH THE MIAMI TEAM HOT ON THEIR HEELS, THAT'S STILL A BAD ROUND FOR THE ARMY. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. JUST LAST YEAR, THE ARMY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY TO HAVE THAT SCORE. BUT TODAY, IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO STAY AHEAD OF AIR MIAMI. - THE ARMY JUST BLEW ONE. - ONE. STAR SAYS WE OUGHT TO TURN IT DOWN A NOTCH. YEAH, SO DOES THE ARMY. JUST STAY ON IT. READY! SET! GO! AIR MIAMI HAS GOT TO BE SMELLING BLOOD HERE. YEAH, BUT THEY'RE A LITTLE TOO EAGER. LOOK HOW THEY ARE CROWDING ONE ANOTHER. THAT'S THE SUREST WAY TO THROW OFF YOUR TIMING. RED LINE HITS-- OH-- THEY LOST IT! COULD BE THAT INJURY WAS WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT. UNBELIEVABLE! A 17.29! CRAIG, I GOTTA TELL YOU, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE CHOKED. NO, NOT A CHOKE, BURT. SOMETHING'S GOING ON IN THE BACK OF THAT LINEUP. - SOMETHING DANGEROUS. - WHATEVER IT IS... THIS IS A MAJOR SETBACK FOR AIR MIAMI. BUMMER. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU NEARLY KNOCKED US OUT OF THE MEET! CUT THE KAMIKAZE SHIT OFF! SO, CRAIG, THE ARMY'S BUILT UP A TREMENDOUS LEAD. EVEN A MEDIOCRE SCORE ON THE NEXT JUMP PROBABLY WOULD CLINCH FIRST PLACE FOR THEM. I'VE GOT TO THINK THEY'RE GONNA CRUISE IN THIS LAST ROUND, - AND JUST PLAY IT SAFE. - NOT DELMIRA. THIS MAN IS ON A MISSION. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. - PEDAL TO THE METAL, THEN? - ALL THE WAY. THEN, LET'S GO RIGHT UP TOP. CLEAN EXIT. PERFECT FORM. OH, NOW THIS IS WAY TOO FAST! JEEZ! YOU SEE, IT'S COLLAPSING! OH, MY GOD! 11.67, A WORLD RECORD! 52.36. THEIR TOTAL. WE NEED A SUB-10 TO WIN. IT'S OVER. RED LINE, OLD BUDDY... It looks like the Golden Knights get the gold again... but you've got the silver locked up. There's something you should know about this Vic Pearson. Your number seven... HE'S A... HE'S REALLY AN EIGHT. Have a good jump. I HOPE IT'S NOT HIS LAST. I KNOW... WHO YOU ARE. SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO... LINE IT UP! NO... NO, WE CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN. REMEMBER LAST TIME? WHAT HAPPENED TO TURBO? CORD ALMOST DIED, TOO. IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OF US. - YOU TWO ARE TOTALLY PSYCHO! - GUYS, GUYS... OUT THERE, ALL THAT STUFF'S COOL, BUT YOU'RE ASKING US TO LAY DOWN AND TAKE TWO TORPEDOES UP OUR ASS. IT'S BETTER THAN A SILVER MEDAL! YOU TWO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. WE'LL CATCH YOU. IT'S NOT ABOUT THIS JUMP. IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE THING! ARE WE AT THE WRONG ALTITUDE, OR SOMETHING? THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE. - DO YOU GUYS NEED OXYGEN? - THE ONLY YEAR OF MY LIFE! - THE LAST TIME WE DID THIS-- - SOMEBODY DIED. TURBO'S DEAD, BUT HE DIED THAT DAY BECAUSE HE JUMPED FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS. HE DIDN'T CUT IT ALL AWAY. I HAVE. I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO DIE... BUT THIS IS WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR. WHAT WE ALL SIGNED UP FOR. AND NOBODY QUITS. STAND BY! EVEN RACE? A SHOT AT THE TITLE. EXIT! READY! - SET... - GO! JESUS! THEIR LAST TWO MEN JUST WENT "NO LIFT." - THEY ARE DIVING BLIND! - WAIT A MINUTE... EXPLAIN TO US. WHAT'S "NO LIFT"? SUICIDE-- MURDER-- I DON'T KNOW! TIME! THEY'RE ON THEIR BACKS! IT'S OVER! YEAH! YEAH! 9.90! A 9.90! I SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, AND I STAND BY THAT STATEMENT! ITWAS IMPOSSIBLE! THE TEAM FROM MIAMI HAS JUST DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE! WHO WON? WE DID! CAN'T YOU HEAR THE CROWD? NO-- WHO WON? I DON'T KNOW. WHO WON? WE DID. WHO WON?! YOU DID. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. ANYTHING YOU SAY... CAN BE USED-- RED LINE... MY MEN ARE EVERYWHERE. BESIDES... IT'S TOO LOW FOR YOU TO USE YOUR RESERVE. - I WON'T BE NEEDING IT. - RED LINE! RED LINE! WHO WON? WE DID. SO, WHAT'S IT ALL MEAN? YOU'RE NUMBER TWO. I SAW THIS YOUNG NEW KID ON THE MICHIGAN TEAM. HE'S NOT THAT FAST NOW, BUT HE COULD BE. ALL RIGHT, NOW LISTEN UP. THE ARMY'S GONNA COME BACK TWICE AS STRONG NEXT YEAR, ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT WE DID TO THEM TODAY. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO JUMP MORE THAN EVER.
