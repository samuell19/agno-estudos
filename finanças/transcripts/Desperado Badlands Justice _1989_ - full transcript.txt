We're closed up, friend. You know a man called Emmett? What about him? I'm looking for him. I heard he worked here. He did. He's moved on to the town of Magnolia. Looking for some excitement, I expect. It's just you two fellas here? Just us two. You mind if I have a cup of coffee? Help yourself. I saw three horses out front. Pete, why don't you explain the way things are to Mr. McCall. That's a nice gun you got there. My friend Sundeen, he's got one just like it. Right now, it's pointed directly at your manhood. Your friend Emmett, I put two whiskeys in him. He liked nothing better than telling me your whole life story. I crown myself, Pete. Why don't you go see about getting Mr. McCall's guns. Aah! -Shut up, Pete. Just stay right where you're at, Pete. I want that $2,000 reward a whole hell of a lot more than I want Pete's company. Man's got to keep his priorities straight. Aah! Desperado Why don't you come To your senses? You been out riding fences For so long now Oh, you're a hard one I know that you got Your reasons These things That are pleasing you Can hurt you somehow Don't you draw The queen of diamonds, boy She'll beat you If she's able You know the queen of hearts Is always your best bet Now it seems to me Some fine things Have been laid Upon your table But you only want the ones That you can't get Desperado Why don't you come To your senses? Come down From your fences Open the gate It may be raining But there's a rainbow Above you You better let Somebody love you Before it's too Late -Daddy! -No, stop! -Cal! -Daddy! Cal! Are you okay? Cal, say something! Daddy! Cal, come on. Come on, Cal. Say something. Daddy? There anybody in there? My husband. Shore-up's collapsing from inside. You got any dynamite? The explosion could kill him. Ma'am, he's dead right now unless we blow him out of there. Get down. Cal. Oh, God. Who's that? That's the man that got you out. I'm obliged, mister. I got to get you inside and fix up that arm. Honey, it's there. What? The gold. I seen it. Oh, Cal. Cal. Come on. Come on. This'll help. You're going to heal up fine. Here you are. -Thank you, ma'am. -You're welcome. You ever been to Philadelphia? No. There's a parcel of land up on what they call Liberty Hill. You can see the sites of four different battles of the Revolution from there. Going to build this house right on that spot, with a view of the river and all four of those sites. Cal studied to build houses before we came out West. Never could make enough to get one off the drawing board. When we sell the mine, I'll be able to build that house. And we're going to live in it, the way we always dreamed. Aren't you going to miss it out here? About the only thing I'll really miss are these flowers. I think they're the prettiest I've ever seen. For what I'm getting paid for that mine, we'll be able to have them shipped back -whenever you please. Does that doll have a name? Victoria. She was named after the Queen of England. Are you going to have room in this house for Victoria? It wouldn't be a palace without her. You know, Cal... a man wanted to work a mine like this, he could find himself rich. I don't need to be rich. Just need enough to build that house and send Jenny to a fine school. After Sam Ethridge comes out to confirm the property lines, we're Easterners as fast as I can get to town, sign the papers and collect my money. I'm real happy for you, Cal. Last night, I'm dead asleep and Allie wakes me. Scared me half out of the bed. I don't know what's wrong. She starts to smile. So I start smiling too. And finally I say, "Why are we smiling?" And she says, "Cal, I never thought I'd say this again, but I want another baby." I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life. I want to show you a secret. All right. Come on. It's real close. Over here. Only the people in our family know about this. I wanted you to know about it too. Well, I'm honored. That's quite a place. We won't be able to take it with us when we go to Philadelphia. No, you won't. Maybe you can keep an eye on it for us. That's going to be a little hard for me to do, Jenny. Why's that? Well, because I won't be around all the time. But if you are around, you'll make sure everything's all right? You got my word on it. Wish you could stay through to supper. I've got a rancher's roast. Well, that sounds real good. But I've got to get to Magnolia. I got some business to tend to. I'll stop back in a couple of days. We'd like that. I wonder if they got that licorice at the general store. Jenny, it's not polite to hint for gifts. It's all right. Sometimes I need a hint. There's no words for all we owe you. Bye. Tequila. His tooth starts aching bad, he gets crazy with it. All he wants to do is drink and fight. They've been trying to get that tooth out for a week. I'm looking for a man named Emmett. I heard he was here in town. He was. Rode out a couple days ago. I got $5 says somebody gets cut. Ten says somebody gets killed. You're drunk. Not drunk enough. Well, you got to be pretty drunk, you don't feel my gun in your ribs. I can cut out your eyes before you pull the trigger. Do it. I'd like to buy these gentlemen a drink. I'm Kirby Clarke. We didn't expect you for the better part of a week, Mr. Boothe. Mr. Clarke... you were always the one to be spoiling our sport. Things were just becoming interesting. The others are at the hotel. Might be more convenient to talk there. Shall we go, Mr. Boothe? Lead the way. Bet ain't over yet. As I explained in the letter, we are a merchant's association. A coalition of concerned citizens, including myself, Mr. Ledon, Mr. Messina, and Mr. Young, our lawyer. I think I made it very clear the problem we face, Mr. Boothe. You see, our community is at a crucial point in its development. We are in a perfect location for a railroad stop on the Albuquerque line. So, what's the problem? You met him. Richard Marriott. The Englishman? Yes. Yes, he has a completely different plan for Magnolia. He's turning this town into a cesspool. Gambling, prostitution, gunrunning. He will line his pockets with the spoils of any dirty little business. Goodness gracious, you saw what it was like over there. The man owns half the town, and he's buying up what's left, including the mines. Well, four able-bodied men like you ought to be able to have a talk with a man like Marriott. That's what we're hiring you to do. You're hiring me to talk to him? I think we made it plain enough in our letter, Mr. Boothe, that we have offered you $900 to come here and kill him. Now, that's what you do, isn't it? One of you own the general store? I'm going to be needing to buy some licorice. Are you going to do it or not? No. Hold it right there! Who are you? A friend. Who did this? Stay where you are. If you were their friend, how come I ain't never seen you before? What happened to the little girl? Who did this? The next shot goes right through your head. I'm going to bury these folks. I'm a miner. I know how to dig. That was your last warning. You better get on your horse and keep traveling, stranger. With our mines, our natural resources and our location on the cattle trail, we are the obvious choice for a railroad stop. And, gentlemen, I plan to live to see Magnolia become one of the biggest towns east of San Francisco. You don't have to sell us, Mr. Clarke. That's why we're here. What concerns us is what this town seems to be turning into. Well, there is no problem that we can't deal with. Well, we can't give you a final decision until we're convinced you're taking the proper steps. Now, I believe the federal marshal is due here on the 10th. That's eight days from now. If he can give us his-- Mr. Boothe? I believe you got my badge? You see, gentlemen? We are not even waiting for the federal marshal. I would like to introduce Mr. Boothe, Magnolia's new sheriff. Your meeting's over. Well, what the hell does that mean? Cal and Allison Parsons have been murdered. Their little daughter's missing. Oh, Mr. Boothe. We are happy that you've reconsidered our offer. But I am unhappy that you interrupt my meeting. You said you wanted a sheriff. We're on the verge of turning this town around, of giving it a future. There's a little girl lost in those hills out there. I want to find her. You're right. You are absolutely right. Cal and Allison were friends of mine, and I-- I shouldn't be thinking about business, not at this time. No, I'll do anything I can to help you. We have got to find her. Let's go! All right, we're going to break up into four groups. Anybody sees any sign of that little girl, fire two shots in the air. It frosts over tonight, that kid'll be dead by morning. Keep looking, Ben. We just got to keep looking. I want everybody back here to saddle up tomorrow. Lyle, come over here. Lyle, we'll show you where your quarters are. You can get settled in. Mr. Boothe, I appreciate what you've done here today. I want you to know that. You've gone far beyond anything that we could have asked or expected of you. And tomorrow morning, I am going to take personal charge of the search party. And then you can get back to the business that you were hired to attend to. Take care of him now. Thank you, again. You want me to show you your office? Know a man named Ethridge? Runs a claims office? Sure. That's it right over there. He lives right behind it. Go on and take my horse over to the stable. Be sure that he's fed and brushed down. Hey, sheriff. I hear you ain't got no conscience. We're closed. You're open. Let's try it again. Cal Parsons told me you were coming out there to check his claim. Mister, I want to know what happened out there. By the time I got there, all there was was the two of them shot dead. Not a thing I could do about it. You could have buried them. Mister, I didn't know if the shooting was finished... someone was just reloading. You see that little girl out there? No, sir. There wasn't any sign of her. Who's buying that mine? Buying the mine? The mine. You went out to check the property lines. For who? That's... private information. It just became public. No one's saying nothing, Mr. Marriott. That's not the answer that I wanted to hear. You'll dig a little deeper and tend to that business immediately, Mr. Pike. Yes, sir, Mr. Marriott. Lee, Miss Caroline at the breakfast table? I told you, we do not have coffee for breakfast. But your guest said he preferred it. My guest? This is quite a surprise. I'm afraid I haven't had the pleasure. This is Mr. Boothe. Magnolia's new sheriff. You should have told us you were coming, Mr. Boothe. I would have had the chef prepare you something special. However, I'm delighted you're here. I was going to send for you anyway. I trust the coffee is to your taste. Tell me, sheriff, did you know Mr. Laughton, your predecessor? No, ma'am. Pike tells me he wasn't very good with a gun. I think that because you're not eating, we will excuse you now, my dear. Sheriff. Ma'am. Mr. Boothe, they tell me that you have been paid a great deal of money to come here and kill me. These people consider me to be the lawless West, and yet they're the ones that go out and hire the professional killer. I'm a businessman, Mr. Boothe. I make my living by catering to the needs of a growing country. That Henry of yours, for instance, I could supply you with several hundreds of those. Or perhaps something with a little more firepower is to your taste. But right now, I'm negotiating the purchase of a Gatling gun. Right now, I'm looking for a little girl. Jenny Parsons? Oh. I can assure you that no one deplores the death of her parents more than I do. You were buying the mine. I had bought it, Mr. Boothe. Cal Parsons and I had shaken hands. The terms were all agreed. But he never turned up in town to sign the papers. If finding Jenny Parsons is in your interest, Mr. Boothe, go to it. Go to it. You have my blessing. Your blessing? Yes, sir. For without that, you would be a dead man. I don't like being threatened. Mr. Boothe. Why don't you leave Magnolia. Ma'am? There's enough corruption in this town without you. And what makes you think that I'm corrupt? You're here. Can I help you with that, Miss Harris? I can manage. I was real sorry to hear about what happened out there at the Parsons place. You have any ideas about that? No, do you? You were their friend. Maybe you answer my question civil-like. Tell me about the little girl. Go to hell. Come here, lady. -I don't think that lady wants to talk to you. Don't be a fool, mister. I'll kill your boss here and put a bullet in your eye before you can cock your gun. He ain't going to do nothing, Merle. Try me, Merle. Let the girl go. Aah! It's just going to get worse. Drop your gun. Tell Marriott to stay out of my way. Thank you. So you're the new sheriff? Henry Boothe. Why were they asking you about the little girl? Because I'm the one that found their bodies. And you didn't see any sign of Jenny? No. She was nowhere in sight. What do you think happened to her? You might ask Mr. Clarke. Isn't he the one that hired you? Ah, Mr. Boothe. I thought you were in charge of the search party. I have men covering every inch of ground for miles around the Parsons' mine. If that little girl is alive, we'll find her. Mr. Boothe... I understand that you had a little talk with Mr. Ethridge last night. Now, maybe I haven't made my position entirely clear to you. Your concern is with Richard Marriott. Now more than ever. Isn't it obvious to you that it was Marriott who killed the Parsons? Marriott was buying their mine. Why would he kill them? That's the way Richard Marriott does business. He makes an offer, and at the last moment he defaults, offers half. If the man doesn't like the terms, he shoots him. He shoots him? Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it? Oh, yes, it does, when he goes to talk to the next miner. Now, I have $1,000 here, Mr. Boothe. There's 900 that was offered to you. An additional 100 of my own. Now, the federal marshal will be here in eight days. We have until then to clean up this town, or we'll lose the railroad. I want Richard Marriott dead and buried by the end of the week. How did your meeting with the railway people go, Kirby? I trust that you managed to reassure them that I was not a threat. I don't recall your name coming up. I have tried to cooperate with you every step of the way. And every step of the way, you have opposed me. I am the future of this town. And the sooner you recognize that, the safer you will be. Are you through? Not yet. If you imagine that this hired killer that you've brought in is going to tilt the scales in your direction, I think you're going to be sadly mistaken. I don't know what you're talking about. This sheriff, or whatever it is you call him, I think you'll find that he's far more interested in finding the Parsons child than he is in my state of health. Well, we're all concerned about the little girl. Yes. We should talk about that sometime. And about the Parsons' mine. There ain't gonna be room enough for all this in the saloon. That's why we're moving next door. To the mercantile? Hey! Careful with that. It come all the way from New Orleans. You. You're not putting that through my front door. Well, we ain't. We're cutting a hole right through the side of the saloon. What's your problem anyways? -You and Marriott made a deal. -I never made that-- You sure as hell did. We're supposed to help you relocate. You got your choice. Another town, or... ...or heaven. I built this place with my own hands. Ma'am. I don't take very kindly to you pointing that thing at me. Well, then you'd better get back on your horse. You're not going to shoot me. Look, I appreciate what you done for me back in town, but it don't mean you're welcome on my land. Did Cal Parsons own a watch? Might have. Solid gold watch? If Cal Parsons owned a watch like this, he'd have traded it in for tools. One of a few things that I brought with me from Europe was an abiding passion for fine Napoleon brandy. How are you, my friend? You disappointed me. Well, yes, of course you're disappointed. But you have to understand, it's a volatile business. My friends in the military have suffered a setback. Temporary one. You guaranteed 500 rifles. All I see outside is 40. You men will be able to take delivery of the rest within a few days. And as for that Gatling gun that you've been so anxious to get your hands on, we have it. No, we had a deal. I made plans based on your word. Then your plans will just have to be adjusted. Sometimes it is not so easy to make these changes. Look, my dear chap, if you want to go off and fight your little revolution and save your people from the chains of oppression, then you will take delivery as and when I can arrange delivery. Unless you know somewhere else where you can do your business. You haven't touched your brandy. The guns ain't yours yet. You pull a gun on my friend again, I will cut off your nose and feed it to you. We do business, no? Maybe they'll just all kill each other, and that'll be that. Damn lot of good your hired killer's doing us. Look here. Pike, it seems like you're always giving somebody a hard time. Seems like you got a problem minding your own business. Well, you're forgetting that I'm sheriff. That makes it all my business. They're Army issue. What about it, Mr. Sheriff? You can't go in there! The U.S. Army. Not only are they corrupt, they're slow. The bar is not open. I found your watch. Thought you might want it back. Well, it's quite beautiful, but I'm afraid it isn't mine. Now, if you'll excuse us, we're trying to talk. You're going to talk to me. Your time as sheriff has just come to an end. Let's go back outside. Go to hell. That weren't supposed to mean no more than a friendly invitation. You just drop your gun there, real easy. I would do what he says. In case you were wondering, I would have shot the kid. Get him out of my sight. We'll take him. Hector... I have done my best to coexist with these people, and this is how they thank me. I want you to find the Parsons girl, even if you have to rip this town apart. I want this matter settled. And if the railroad or anybody else wants to speak to the person in charge of Magnolia, they will speak to me. Go find the girl. What is it? What do you want? Just a little friendly conversation, Mr. Young. I believe... that this is yours. Now then, Mr. Young, I understand that you drew up Cal Parsons' will. I was his lawyer, yes. Excellent. Now all you have to do is tell me the specifics. I imagine that his daughter inherited. Mr. Marriott, a lawyer isn't allowed to violate the confidentiality-- Do you want us to violate his confidentiality, Mr. Marriott? No, no, no, Mr. Pike. That won't be necessary. Nothing untoward is going to happen here. Jenny Parsons inherited, is that correct? I assume there was a trustee. Of course. She was only a child. The name, Mr. Young. The name! Emily Harris. And Miss Harris can sign for the child? Up until her 21st birthday. She can, for instance, sign over the child's rights to the mine. I would have that checked if I were you. I believe it's running a little fast. Hello, Emily. May I come in? I want to discuss your claim. No, you may not come in. Oh. Why, have you got some fortunate fellow stashed away inside? Just tell me what you want and then get the hell off my land. Now, I have come here in good faith. I haven't brought anybody with me. What is that, a threat? Well, I hadn't construed it as such. But I will give you some advice. Magnolia is becoming more and more an unpleasant place to live in. Now, please let me come inside so that I can discuss with you how I can buy your mine. And if I won't sell? What are you going to do? Kill me too? I think that was uncalled for. You got just enough time to get back in that carriage and get out of here, or else I'm going to blow you back to wherever you came from. You have worked so hard since your brother died. You sacrificed your life and your dreams for his dream. I admire that. I can make your dreams come true, Emily. Get off my land. Good day. Sleep well. Aah! Whoa. Whoa. Come on out of there! I told you, I don't take kindly to you pointing that thing at me. You're bleeding. Did you get that the last town you were sheriff in? Something I really ought to tell you. What? That you ain't Henry Boothe? Last town I lived in before Magnolia, a man came through there about five years ago named Henry Boothe. Shot up that town pretty good. Well, my name is Duell McCall. And knowing that information can make you $2,000. They say I killed a sheriff. Did you? No. I've been looking for the man who did. Well, staying around Magnolia trying to find Jenny... how's that going to help you find this man? Well, I haven't been doing it because of that. I stayed with the Parsons for a couple of days. It was like looking through a store window at something I could never hope to buy. And besides that, I know what it's like to lose your family. Does it really matter that much to you? Something's got to. When Cal and Allison were shot... I was out in the woodshed. I was fixing a pickax. I heard the shots. I just didn't think nothing of it. I figured it was just somebody doing some hunting. It wasn't until the night there was somebody at my door. Jenny. She run all the way down from her folks' mine. She said her mama told her to just keep running. Don't look behind, no matter what she heard. She hid out back until it got dark. Is she all right? She's safe. I have her with a friend. Does she know who killed her folks? No. Can I ask you to do something for me? Hold me. Good morning. Good morning. Who did you think was out in the stable last night? I thought maybe Marriott had come back. Come back? He was out here earlier. He wanted to buy my mine. I think you'd better take me to Jenny. You any good with that rifle? Aren't you supposed to be tied to a wagon somewhere? Sheriff, you know, we's only expecting the lady. That must be why there's only three of you. Lady, right now, that little girl is the last of your worries. Wouldn't you say? Pat? Jared? Aah! I'm so sorry, Emily. The four of them just came in. The child and I were just sitting down to breakfast. Where'd they take the little girl? You go to hell. Mister, you're not going to make it. Why don't you help the little girl? Pike took her. I don't know where he... Marriott won't hurt her. How do you figure that? He wants the mine. He's got to talk to me. I'm her guardian. You know a town called Kelton? Yeah. Why? Take me there. I came for that rifle shipment. You ain't Pike. I am now. What am I supposed to tell Pike when he shows up? I wouldn't waste a lot of time on that. Now that you got everything you want, I guess you'll be going, huh? You're forgetting something. I don't know what you mean. The Gatling gun. Pull the cover off. Emily, my dear. How nice to see you. I was just enjoying a good book. Do you find you have much time for reading these days? I want to see Jenny. Yes. Well, I think it might be more prudent to discuss the young lady's business in my study. Well, I must say, it took you longer to come and see me than I'd expected. Please. I want Jenny. Yes, of course you do. I didn't expect that you'd come because you'd changed your mind about my proposal. Well, she's a charming little girl. So well behaved for someone brought up out here. I want to see her. You know, I do believe that Cal made a very, very wise choice in appointing you her guardian. Damn you. Bring her to me. Oh, she's not here. Caroline cannot abide children. Where is she? She's safe. Now then... all I want is what was agreed upon. I have here a bill of sale. You will sign it for the child. I will give you, to hold in trust for her, the $5,000 that I promised Cal. You promised Cal $10,000. Did I? Now, you have taken up enough of my time. I suggest that you sign the bill of sale. And I suggest you look out your front window. What the...? [horses whinny and dogs bark distantly] Have you gone out of your mind? That's a nice piece of merchandise you got here. I've already told Emily the little girl isn't here. Well, I wouldn't have shot up your whole house if I thought she was. Then what do you want? I want the little girl! I've got your guns. You bring her to Emily's, I'll give them back to you. One hour. Sheriff. Sheriff, I don't know anything about that little girl. But I do know that Richard Marriott is a lot of things, but he's not responsible for those two people being killed. And what about that little girl? You think once he gets his rifles back, he won't put a bullet in her? We never did take that trip to San Francisco, did we? Richard, I didn't tell him anything, I swear. Then where is it written that marriage isn't a marriage without a honeymoon? Oh, I have no illusions about this. I know you don't love me. But then, love isn't everything in a marriage, is it? You know... the first time I saw you, the thing that I found most beautiful about you was your hair. It was so soft. So silky. I truly believed it was the most beautiful hair in the world. Richard, don't. Now I'm going to be able to keep that beauty with me forever. Hurry. Have you heard? Marriott's got the girl. Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Mr. Henry Boothe. Gentlemen. Sorry I was detained. Where's Charlie Young? Was that my gun that did this? It seems that, once again, you are unable to keep your word. -Just a minute... -No, no, no, no. No more excuses. And no more delays! My men will take the Gatling gun, and you will return the money we advanced you for the rifles. That is out of the question. We have a deal. But you have lost control of the situation. The rifles are no longer in your possession. Am I to take that to mean that you intend to take control of the situation? You come from a people with a glorious history of unfinished revolutions, rampant starvation, and pathetic attempts at self-government, and you intend to take control? I want the money. The money has been spent, you idiot. Do you not understand how commerce works? How the hell do you think I got the Gatling gun? Now, get out of my way so I can get you your rifles back. I know how to get you your guns. That looks like Charlie Young. Whoa. I wanted you... to tell you... the watch was mine. I didn't know he was going to shoot. Pike? Richard's ready for the little girl now. All right, I hear you. She's asleep. Whoa. I didn't know you smoke. I don't. Isn't it time for you to take a walk? Where's the girl? It doesn't work like that. It doesn't work that way either. Hey, you tell your boys to throw their guns. Throw 'em far. Do as he says. Do it! I'm just going to keep this lit for the time being. Where is the girl? She's in good hands. You don't think I'd leave her here, do you? Given your propensity to go down blowing things to bits? Well, you best see about getting her. All in good time. Now, I'm going to tell you this again, because I want you to understand me quite clearly. I did not kill Cal and Allison Parsons. As I told Emily, I had a deal with Cal. A deal which I am prepared to honor. All I want is Emily's signature. And, of course, my guns. Get the girl. You don't appear to understand me. Mr. Pike is bringing the girl here. Now, though I didn't kill the parents, unless I get the signature, I'm perfectly prepared to kill the child, do you under Now tell me who has control of the situation. You can live or die. Emily! May I take my guns? Hell, yes. Thank you. I didn't do this for you. These guns are to keep my country free of men like that. Vamonos! Hyah! Hyah! Come on, let's go up to the house. Bring the little girl over here. I don't want no part in killing a little girl, Kirby. You want this little girl's testimony to leave you hanging on the gallows? This whole thing's gone too far. We were going to just ride out and talk to Cal Parsons. You end up shooting 'em. Now we come to this. If Cal had sold me the mine instead of Marriott, none of this would have happened. Anyways, you don't have to pull the trigger. That's what we're paying Mr. Boothe for. This sure as hell is the land of opportunity. I get offered a job to work here. I come to find another man doing that job in my stead. Sure didn't expect that man to be you, McCall. I believe that $2,000 reward on you was alive or dead. The girl, Mr. Boothe. -Be my pleasure. It don't matter who pulls the trigger. It just ain't right. I can fix it so you don't see it. You never had a chance, Kirby. None of us did. Freshened him up for you, sheriff. Ain't let no one else touch him. You did a good job. This one's on me. Well, there you are, Miss Harris. I guess you're about as rich as anyone around here. Did you hear about the railroad? They're going to start work on the depot next month. Yes. Oh. I just wanted you to know, Miss Harris, how I'm sorry about everything. We don't have to talk about it again. Come on, Jenny, let's go. We thought you'd gone. Well, I couldn't leave before I kept my word. It's licorice and hard candy. And what else is in there? It's beautiful. Do you know where to wear that? Near my heart. You can't stay on a little longer? Well, I met a lady a while back, and she gave me some pretty good advice. She said, "Get back on your horse, stranger. Keep traveling." You're not a stranger anymore. Desperado Why don't you come to your senses? Come down from your fences Open the gate It may be raining But there's a rainbow above you You better let somebody Love... you Before it's too... Late
