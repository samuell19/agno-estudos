It's smoking! Hello! My car broke. Hello. Tell Father I won't be able to do the first reading. That's an easy one, I can fix it for you. Thank you. - Have you been here for a long time? - Yeah. Truth be told, I'm always waiting for you. But you're always busy, can't even throw me a glance. That's why I'm waiting for a day that you'll finally notice me. So I can.. So what? So I can tell you that... I love you. I love you. I love you too. Yikes! Agent X44? Yes. You know me? Kid, you can just call me. Tony Falcon. Okay? Tony Falcon! Me and my dad are a fan of yours! He's even mimicking how your dress, are you aware of that? Thank you very much. Sometimes I think no one likes me anymore. No, you're just being too dramatic. Let's change topic, why are you here? I mean, where's Eric? Everything's fine, why'd you have to appear? Eric? He's on his apartment, deep asleep. He's sleeping? - So, this is all a dream? - That's right. And I thought everything's real. Rizette, do you really have a big clock, on your condo? What? A big clock on your condo. Ahhh. I'm indeed dreaming. Good morning Manila, Philippines! Good morning! It's all a dream, but that's fine. I'm still beautiful. Hey, wake up! Stand up so you can run errands for me! I feel like God has dedicated this day for me. I'll meet Eric again. You know that giggly feeling, you can't explain? Hey! Rizette, Rhea, fix your bed and go here. Alright, here I go. Hey! - Wake up. - Let me sleep some more. I'm glad you feel like it's your day but let me just continue sleeping. - Ma, 'morning. - You two, go down here. Pa, I'll start moving. Hey, wake up! You know, I don't understand you. No, no, I don't want to! Stand up, wake up! Opening song playing, a rendition of "Mahirap magmahal ng syota ng iba" You Thought... Ma, I'll have to go. Let me have it. How many semesters do you have left? Around three. Why don't you use our savings? It's your savings with Dad, and I can fund my schooling. What I want is you, to finish your studies, and land a good job. I got a good job, aren't I? My job is the same with you two before, our life's good. I'm listening to your conversation. If I can choose, I'd want a better life for you. Me and your mom were both security guards, same with your grandpa, and it's the same with your uncle. How about changing your path? Do you mean you regret it? No, I don't. I'm happy and thankful, that we were security guards. 'Cause if not, our paths might have never crossed. See, you liked it. If not for our job, you might not be here. Because of your job, you met each other. Just like me and Eric, we met on my workplace. Ma, ever wondered if our ancestors were some sort of guards too? Maybe, maybe not. Too much talking, you have to go. Rhea, you'll be late! - They're about to leave. - The basket! Coming, wait for me! You're always late, ah? Pa, my goodbye kiss? - Follow us later. - Okay, will do. - Follow us, ha. - Yeah, I'll just fix things. - Bye bye! - No worries. What? Be ready. He'll be there in a while. He's coming? Good morning sir! Alright. Wait, wait, don't touch that, that trash bin. The wrapper, the candy wrapper! Alright, this is his candy wrapper. Why don't you take it all, you could've helped me. That's not included in my agenda. This is what I care about. Candy wrapper and his smile earlier. I got this wrapper and his smile. - He smiled at you? - Yes, he did. He's using his phone, how can he smile at you? He isn't cross-eyed. It happened there and you're here, you didn't saw it. Mind your business. How can you not accept that I'm in a relationship with Eric? It isn't difficult to understand, right? What a morning. - I pity you. - Where's my pen? I pity you. I don't care. October 22, 8:43 AM. Eric smiled at me. Why don't you write any real events on your logbook? Even a bit. This is mine, don't stick your nose here. All I care is, he smiled at me. Period. He smiled at me, he's just too shy to stare at me. Visit a doctor. I really pity you and your illusions. - Hi Rizette! - Hi love! Done with breakfast? - I'm done. - I haven't eaten since last night. - I'm asking her, not you. - Let me have it, please. You know, I'm thankful and I appreciate this. Did you prepare this? Actually, it's not yet paid. Is that so? How about your meal earlier? Your next meal? I'll pay for them. Stop working and I'll have you covered. Take care! I feel insulted. So when can I see you? You have to be specific, let's set a date. I'm persistent and I won't stop until you say yes. No, no. I won't take no for an answer. You know me.. Okay! You're sure, huh? I'll drop by your place. Okay, alright. I'll hang up, call you later. Uncle, I'm watching. Let's talk first. Will you go to work? My boss arrives late, so it's fine. He's a manager, how about you? Even so, I already met my quota. Have you enrolled? Next semester. If you actually enrolled, on all of your next semester promises, you could have finished Medicine. Guilt-tripping.. I'm just reminding you. Your mother's order to me, is you'll enroll next semester, so you can follow them abroad. You know I don't like Australia. I'm working here so all is good. So you can have fun? Enrico, make sure that you'll enroll, next semester because, your mom is bugging me. Alright, I'll enroll. Do you think I'll believe you? Asshole. Sis! - Yes? - When will we go home? Your shift ended hours ago. I need to go home for my assignments. Why are you in a hurry? I thought you wanna meet my boyfriend? Why are you in a rush now? - Rizette. - What? Be ready, he's coming. - Really? - Yeah, he'll be there in a bit. - Alright, bye. - He's there? He's arriving, follow me. He's really handsome. Come over here, he'll be here in a bit. - Where is he? - Look over there. Make sure you look presentable, I'll introduce you to him. Eric, here's Rhea, my cousin. So now, he's cute, right? He's so handsome! I'm disappointed, I thought you were already in a relationship. We got mutual understanding, no need to talk about it. Sis, I don't understand the relationship you're referring to. He just passed by without even saying "Hi" to you. He got shy because he saw you. - Is that so? - Yeah! Shouldn't you apologize to me? I went here for nothing? You know... Rhea, where are you getting those misconceptions about love? Don't you know that every relationship starts with glances? He didn't even look at you. Eh, I'm not in a hurry. I don't know why you're in a rush. I'm enjoying this "he acts like he don't know, but he actually do" phase. Well, I wish you really good luck. If your plan is to stand there and wait for him until he notice you, you'll be waiting forever. You should act and take actual steps. I'll have to go, wasted my fare for nothing. Thanks for the treat. Thanks. Do you think Eric will notice me? Do you think Jun will notice me? Do you think Eric will love me someday? Do you think Jun will love me someday? Are you making fun of me? No! I also have problems with my love life! Rhea's advice was right. I should do something. Rizette! - Rizette? - Don't touch me! - It's stressing me out. - Yeah! - I'm kind, right? - That's right! I understand him but he abused that! Rizette, no! - Stop! Don't do it! - Get out of my way! - I don't care if I get hurt! - Yeah! Should've done it before. No! Lord, your will be done. It's up to him now! Nooooooo! - Let's go. - What's the plan? Let's go! Where? Hi! What? I'm Rizette. Your guard, I mean the building's guard. - So what? - Any problem? Isn't it obvious? I need to leave but I got flat tire. Yeah, I see. It's flat. Need help? You can fix it? Yeah, changing tire's an easy task. - Are you really sure 'bout that? - Sure, I can fix it. Just trust me. If you're sure, I'll leave it to you. Sorry but I really need to go, fix it for me. He's a bit lazy huh. Be thankful you're handsome. "Close". Okay okay, don't be mad. I'll help you with it. At least, we're a bit, closer now. He put his arms on my shoulder. He touched me and, I feel like he's interested in me. You're closer with this wheel. I saw it. - You got dirt as a remembrance. - Same with you. That's incl... Don't do that! He'll get mad. - One day, I'll destroy that car. - Let's go. Let's go! At least we got a new fallback. Dad, with how long you've been stargazing with Mom... Have you seen a real shooting star? Yes, saw it once. Is it on a new year's eve? That might be a roman candle. No. Let me tell the story. I'm in a memorial park with her. I haven't taken any actions back then. A shooting star suddenly appeared, so I wished upon it. It eventually came true. What's the wish? Of course, for me to marry your Mom. Sigh. I wish a falling star, a shooting star, appear in front of me. What would you wish for? I want to be with Eric someday. My only wish, what else would it be. Shouldn't have asked. How about you? Simple, I'll wish for you to see a falling star so you can be with him. - So we can be at peace. - I agree. Crazy! Be serious, what is it? Be serious. Aside from your stuttering to stop. Nothing. Maybe I'd wish for, our Lord, even for a drug lord, to take my stepfather, so I can be in good terms with my Mom and I can have a family again. Aren't we your family? - Self-pity. - What did she say, dug lord? Dug lord... Stutter kid. Got more? Are you complaining? My mom made that out of pure glutinous rice. - Any drinks? - Still looking for more, huh? I'll give more after my salary. Ple... Hey! I'm still talking... We're good, yeah? - Okay? Make it longer. - Alright. Okay, fine. Bye! Do you see him? Yeah, he's coming. Be prepared. Okay, don't call again. Low battery. Why block me? Why? Go on another one, don't mess with my plan. Go away! - Sell that later. I don't need it. - Okay. - Good morning, love! - Ay, good morning! - Ouch! - Yes, that's possible. Hang up, I'm in an elevator. Is that important? Okay okay, wait a minute. Let me go out. Hi Love! - Love? - How's life? Sorry, can't hear you. Hi! Why are you here, what are you doing? Lord, why is this happening? I've been a good follower. Jun? Jun? Jun? Am I not allowed on elevator? Why are you messing up my plans? - You're pretty. - Shut up! It's as if this is fate. Yeah, you're fated to ruin my day. I hope they won't fix this. Please Lord, don't listen. He's a bad guy. - Rizette, I love you. - No, don't touch me! Touch me and you'll regret it! I assure you! I do love you. Shut up, talk to this stick. Rizette wants it longer... So wish granted. Junjun! Jun! Rizette... - You know... - No touch! Jun! Jun! Jun! Your watch looks g... Why don't you give me a chance? What do you think? You're so ugly! Ugly as hell! - Helloooo! - Noo, stop! I won't repeat that again! This sucks! Make it fast, please! You're too slow! It's opening! Ju-jun! Wait for me, Jun! Okay, go away now! - Beauty, beauty! Help me get off here! - Jun, wait! I'll help you get out! Rizette, you go help yourself... Jun, are you fine? Feeling dizzy? You look fine already. Jun, use my shoulders to go up. Oops, I can't carry you. Step on me instead! Yeah, yeah, go step on me! Step on me! - Are you fine? - Yeah I'm good, enjoy your stay there! Okay Jun, take a rest please! Get some air! Yes sir. Thank you. Bye. Eric, there's a problem. Mr. Chris Dela Paz called, and the papers aren't in yet. You promised it last week. - Shit, I forgot. - Here you go again. - Sweetheart? - Yes? - Please help me. - How? Here's how. Call our connections at LTO. Tell them that it's needed as soon as possible. Ask them to make it quick, then bring the papers to Dela Paz's office. - Trying to use me? - Please? Don't pass your workload to me. It's just a favor. In exchange, I'll take you out for lunch. - Promise? - Sure. - A promise? - Yep. Really? Call them! - Okay, got ya. - I don't know who wins the competition. Hello, LTO...

[ song plays ] Impossible It's hard to believe Something this questionable Impossible It only happens on the movies Impossible Impossible Hey! What? We're done. What? Just a misunderstanding. It's not clear, explain it. Why can't he love me? Eric won't be happy with her... Because no one can rival my love for him! Those lines are from a movie. - Good movie? - Yeah. That's probably a sign. Of what? You know, it's hard, to force yourself unto someone who doesn't like you. What should I do? How about stop it? You know... Push yourself some more, and you're a fool. - Just like you? - Yeah. It's not easy. It's always like this! Being stupid doesn't feel good. So stop it! Let's change paths. - Let me treat you. - For real? - Yeah. - That's a promise. What's that? Tell me. Are you crazy? Can you stop this? Are you starting a cult? Tell me. I'll quit! - I quit. - I quit! - I quit. - I'll stop being a fool! - I'll stop being a fool. - Good. I'm done. - Hey, what are you hiding there? - Nothing! - No, I saw a sampaguita. Can smell it. - No, there's nothing here. What is that, show it to me, friend. - I quit. - I quit! Quit making fun of me, we're the same. You're indeed my best friend. You're my idol, that's why. He's cute here, he'll pass as a stuffed toy. Let's go. Yes! That's a good one! Yes! You're really good. Let's talk later, approved! Oh no. This game is tiring, the balls are heavy! Where'd you get that girl? My nephew brought her. Alright, it's game time! - Take some rest. - Okay, will do. Y'know what, this mascara really works. What brand do you use? Huh? I don't use make-up when bowling. Really? Why not? How did you two met? - Ah... - Let me tell them the story! This is really funny! I was in the mall for like twenty minutes, you know. I was looking for my car in the parking lot. I roamed a lot, and I can't find my car. So I'm about to call the security, because I thought my car was stolen. So then, I saw Eric. Love you! Love you too. He looks so kind so I asked him to help me. Oh? So where's your car then? Yeah, so we went through each of the cars on the lot. Then I realized my car's not parked on that level! So it's on another floor, and you just got confused? Nooo! - So it's on the other building? - Still no! I'm parked at a different mall! It's hilarious now that I remember it. I'm just really confused that day. So where's your car? As I said, it's on a different mall because I'm really confused that day. Ahhhhhh... That's confusing. Yeah, gosh! It's really cute how we met. Yeah, it's cute. It's cute. Eric, why do you like her? Why ask? She doesn't look like someone you'd pursue. That's right. Seriously? Then why are you clinging to her? Uncle, I'm not marrying her. We're just dating. Why would I look for qualities, when I planned not to marry anyone. Was that enough? What a jerk. Sis! I hope we gaze upon a falling star. - I don't care anymore. - Huh? A change of mind? - I don't have anything to wish.... - What do you mean? Mom, I got no wishes now. Something to do with your love? Wish for anything else instead. I don't want to. He's what I want. Rizette, you know, dreaming for someone isn't bad but you shouldn't devote everything to him. You don't always get what you wish for. I know that, Mom. I already accepted the fact that he won't like me back. If he don't like me, that's fine. I'm a lowly guard... I'm just pretty but that's fine. Don't look down on that job, because whatever we got now is from that job. I mean, I'm not belittling my job. Why are you belittling yourself? I'm just being realistic. Nothing wrong with that mindset but, don't look down on yourself because that's how people will see you. You know... - I got a solution for your problem. - What it is? Forget about Eric and I'll introduce you to someone new! I'm not interested, sorry. Eric's the only one I want. Only him. Hey! You should've been done! - Sorry, I have lots of tasks. - Okay, bring it there. - To the other cage. Go. - Okay. Done counting that? - Yes, this is complete. - Okay, go. - Hi Joey! - Oh, Rhea. - Someone's taking care of you two? - Chong is already with Mr. Rudy. No schedule for school today? None, I mean my class will start at afternoon. - I'm here to ask you something. - What is it? Do you have a girlfriend? Don't have one yet. - How about a wife? - None. Why is that so? Can't find my type. - So what's your type? - You can take those if you want. - Kind, thoughtful, sweet, and pretty. - Let me check first. It's important we have the same interests. You're interested with... ducks? - You got more of that? - Yeah we have more. - That's good with me. - Put those here. How much per piece? - I can give it for... - Why are you asking those questions? So here's why... - I'll find a girl you'll like. - 40 pesos per piece? - Don't introduce me to someone ugly. - No, she's beautiful. - As beautiful as you? - Of course! Temyong, I'll let both of you negotiate. - Rudy, manage the farm. - Okay. - Rhea, I have to leave. - Thank you, sir Joey. - Get me good ducks. - Hey, tell me what your topic is. Nothing, I'll just find him a match. Find me a girl, too! - I don't want to. - Please? My niece is still young, her aunt might get mad at you. I'm not after her, just asking questions. Rhea, stop what you're doing. - Go get some more. - Okay. - I thought you'll stop chasing him. - Yeah. What's your problem?! I thought we should stop her! Yeah, but I realized that it's better if she's still mad in love with Eric. - Why? - Do I need to explain it? While she's crazy for Eric, you won't have a chance to her. If that's the case, I can still go after you. See? - Really? - Yeah! - Let's spar once, wanna try? - We're together so it's fine! What a crazy girl! I can't make it today, Uncle Bert has errands for me. Next day? I'm not available either. Wednesday... How about on Wednesday? Not today, why are you persistent? I said on Wednesday. Hey, what's that? Hello, I already got a phone... Okay. Wait for me outside. This is good model! Freeze! Stop acting like you're talking with someone, there's no signal here. There's no exit point there. Don't dare move! Hah, I don't even need a gun. Hey you, fight me! Wow! Grandmaster-like moves! Yoooooo! That's insane?! Yes! Move! That's the end for you... Yes! Guard? Miss? Were you hurt? Injuries? - You're okay? - I'm fine. - I'm fine. - Sure? Eric! Don't worry, my uncle knows the doctors here. They'll take care of you. Mom? Sis? You're finally awake! Rizette, I'm glad you're awake! Dad! Dad! Wake up! She's awake now. My God... Rizette... - How are you feeling right now? - What do you feel? Wanna drink? Rhea, get some water! Drink this. - Ma. - What's the matter? Where's Eric? What a fool! Are you crazy? Are you insane? - Why did you risk your life? - Same question. That's my obligation as a security guard. What nonsense is that? Don't forget that we are also guards back then, and I know our job. That is to guard the building, - not risk our lives for a mobile phone. - Yeah. If you got killed, what would that Eric do? Yeah! That's right so you should be thankful that you ain't dead yet. Did Eric visited me already? Looks like your injury went over your head. Dad! I need this contract printed. Make a copy and send it to accounting. Hello, good morning ladies. You look good today. This is for you. - And here's for you. - Eric, it's good afternoon already. Eric, I already filed your PO's. Really? - And here are your contracts. - Oh, nice. - That's already followed-up with legal. - Okay, thank you. I'm glad you're here. - How about me? - My... angels? - Thanks for these. - Okay, thank you. Ha ha... Thank you. Know what? He gave chocolates and, you're acting all giddy. Cheap girls. - You're just jealous. - Cheapskate, can't even give anything. - That's right! - Correct! Bro, if I'd be given a chance, I'll hang that guy. Hurry up before he gets promoted. Hi! - Hi! - Am I too early? A bit, because I ain't ready yet. - Will it be long? - Here... Hmm... I just finished hot oil, wax, threading. Now my hair's being set. So... - So another treatment after? - Yeah, foot spa and paraffin treatment. Will it take 30 minutes? Around an hour and a half... Are you fine with that? We'll be late on screening. It's fine, let's skip the movie. Let's change plans. Let's visit Rizette instead. Why? Asking why? Don't you want to meet the girl who saved me? Nope. I feel guilty, you know... She risked her life and we won't visit her? Send her flowers and fruits. That's enough. Already did that. Please fix this part, it's a bit messy. ...that's the truth. Rhea? - Yes? - Get the clearance from accounting. - Got it. - Let's meet at the lobby later. Ma, did he not visit me? Nope. But he paid for your hospital bills. Maybe he wanted to visit me. - Or he's just busy. - Hold on, wait! Wait! - Maybe you should forget him. - Quick, it's closing! You should think about how you can quickly recover. Get in. It's expensive. Rhea? My love... - Stop! - Relax, don't be too obvious. Hi. - Good thing I arrived in time. - Yeah we're going home. Dr. Salvador also told me that. Ah yeah, that's correct. Here's my mom. My dad, and my cousin. Good morning. So... I'll drive you. No need, it's too far. We're from Binangonan, Rizal. - That's fine with me. - Yeah! She saved you so it's only fitting you do this much. Binangonan's pretty far. - Let's save some fare. - Dad.... Okay okay. Let's go. If you say so... - Don't move fast. - Sorry for the hassle. My family's strict. It's beautiful here. Spacious, and there are lots of okra. Ah yes, I planted all of it. Thanks for driving us home. That's nothing, I should be the one thanking you. You have no idea how many people are stabbed because of phones. I'm one of them... Your family loves ducks... My mom's business. Heyyyyyy! Hey! Hey. Eric, dine with us later. Taking that would be too much. Dad... Eric will be dining with us since it's already late, okay? Fine with me! Yeah, you should stay here, so Rizette will be happier... Right? No need to go to work immediately. I talked to your agency. Why? Heh. You see her? You got no idea, how excited she is to work, even if she has to report while bleeding. Let's go, so you can rest. Okay. - Yeah, I need to rest. - Ouch! Get in, we'll eat now! Hey, dinner's ready! Go inside and follow me! Dad! - Let's eat. - Ignore her, that's just how she is. Let's go. - Let me help. - Okay. Go eat inside. - Ouch, ouch. - Be careful. - Can we sleep... no, we should eat. - Right there? Hold me so I won't.... Sir, let's eat. Dad, let's eat... or you can stay there. - Eric, let's eat. Dad, we'll go inside. - Go. I can't pay you right away, I haven't sold my three haciendas. My driver uses the car because he has a board meeting. Okay, I'll just call you. I'll give you an update. Yeah yeah, I'll let you know. Bye-bye. There's a problem. Tell me. I talked to your Mom. I got no idea who told her that you didn't enroll. You should have explained. I wasn't able to talk back, she's even asking me, to pay my long-forgotten debt. She might not send money for tuition and allowance. That's fine, I can enroll myself with my salary. What do you want for dinner? Pizza or resto take-out? Do you really want me to choose? Okay, get me a knife and I'll stab you. You're making my life hard, I don't know what are your plans in life. You're dragging me with you. - Ah Rudy. - Hi Joey! What's up? Your uncle? They got lots of orders for fried duck, - So I'm paying in his behalf. - Oh, okay. - So, Joey? - Yeah? Do you agree? To what? - I'll match you with someone. - I asked you to match me as well. - Rudy, Rudy. - No! - Rudy, help with what they are doing. - They can manage that. Just go, we don't need a batch of broken eggs. Alright, alright. Take this... Handle it properly. - Find me a match. - I don't want to, go away! - Please? - No! Leave! Start again. I'll introduce you to a girl. Hmm, go. Do your thing. I'm not actively searching for a girl. If I meet someone, then go. That's why I'll let her meet you. You're funny. Describe that girl to me. Does she like ducks? Not only she like ducks, she also love, balut, penoy... and she's pretty! The qualities you're looking for she got them! And she gives it all when it comes to love! You're still young and you're already thinking of dating. Can't you prioritize your studies? I disagree, I'm not a kid anymore. - I'm a teenager. - Nope, not buying that one. You're a kid. Welcome back. - Friend, you look happy. - Yeah. - Wanna throw a party? You fit there. - Yeah yeah. Now that... you're back, we'll have to share Jun's attention. What? He's yours, I don't care about him. Chase him all you want. Is that clear? - Clear? Don't you know.... - Hey! You're back. - Yeah, I am. - That's great! I'm in a hurry now so, what time are you going home? - Ah... 6 p.m. 6 p.m. - Okay okay. - Let's eat later. - You don't... - Okay, yes. - Alright. Wow! I feel like stabbing myself out of jealousy. He's here! He'll stab me with love! Jun, go stab me wherever you like! - Please stab me... - I kid you not. I'll actually stab you! I got a bad day! Hot-headed. He's another case, of someone who can't face the truth. See? - Looks like a kid's meal... oatmeal. - Want this? You know, I have no idea how to thank you enough. You've already done so much. No need to go for more, it's fine. How about this, tell me a story. Story? Like how long you've been a guard, how you started, or tell me about your family. Anything. Actually, we're a family of security guards. The agency I am in now is the same with my parents. The separation pay that they got were used to start a business. As for me, I saved everything that I earned for 2 years. For what? For studies, I'm still studying. I'm taking Business Administration and I got three semesters left. You know, there are companies granting scholarships. Why don't you apply? Especially, for deserving students, like you. I didn't know that before, and I can fund myself by working. You're hardworking. I need it that's why. How about you? I'm working but I'm too lazy to study. Lazy? Why is that so? I don't know. Does that need a reason? Can't answer that. - Oh My God! Stupid! - Sorry mam... - I'm really sorry. - Careless! Clumsy! Stupid as hell! - I'm really sorry. - You messed my new dress! - Mam, you don't need to. I can clean... - It's fine. Thank you, mam. Why did you do that? What is it? Helping the waiter earlier. Have you ever wondered how many tenants are there on your condo? A lot. There are lots of them. Over... a hundred I guess. - One hundred? - Yes. - And that one hundred... - You'll adjust to every one of them? Of course. Think of it, every owner has different personalities. There are kind, someone who greets you, conceited guy or gal, rude. I have to deal with all of them and I know how it feels to be embarrassed. You've already made a mistake and they'll make you feel bad. - You'll want to suddenly disappear. - Right. I can relate to that waiter, so I helped him. Alright, let's go! - Lots of cars, let me call a guard. - No, I can do it. - Are you sure? - Yeah, let me do it. Okay! Go. Okay. Okay. Let's go! Okay! - Okay, time to leave. - You're good, huh. While you're not here, unit 7 and unit 8 owners fought. They pulled each other's hair! I thought his boyfriend is from unit 9? Here's a thing, unit 7 actually resembles the other... - How about the partner of that girl? - He's here. Hello. - Hi. - I bought these for you. - Coffee and pastries. - I'll surely miss this. Why is that so? I'll be assigned to another place. Huh? Why? That's how it works, we're usually changing areas. How about, I talk to your agency so you'll stay? There's no need to. No, let me try. Nothing to lose anyway. Up to you. I need to leave, I'll be late. Okay, take care! Thanks for the treat. - Okay. - Okay. Love you. What to do, you'll be far from him? That's fine. The agency's looking for a graveyard shift in preparation for my schooling. Good for you... making progress. Then get assigned to another place. I don't wanna be far from Jun, my love! That looks expensive, can I have some? It's for me so sorry, no sharing. - Please spare me some, I'm hungry. - No, this is for me. - You became selfish. - Yeah yeah, okay, I'm selfish. Have your breakfast, love. Perfect timing love, she already got food. Thank you. I'm taking the coffee, as she already got too much of it. Thank you. Thank you my love. I'm sorry you got no coffee. - Share? - Cheers! - You look like those ducks! - Want this on your face? I'm busy... Will that take long? It will be done, three pieces left. Sis? Is Eric your boyfriend? I don't know. You don't know? Yeah, why is that so? - One piece, please. - We're not talking about it. It's like M.U. (Mutual Understanding). MU? What's that MU? What does that mean? Know what? There's no middle ground. Either he's your boyfriend or not. It's like this. When you're understanding each other, both of you are happy. Together, you're happy. You miss each other, when you're far apart. His problems, are also your problems. It's just like that, no need to make things complicated. Once you've said "I love you" to each other, that's as good as being in a relationship. Wait a minute kid, tell me... That guy, did he confess to you his feelings? Ha? - Not yet. - Oh? But I'm sure with what I feel for him. 100%! We know what you're feeling. We're sure with what you feel. Me and your mom wants to know what that guy is really after. You'll visit Eric, miss? Yes, why? Nothing. He already left. - Really? - Yeah. - He left a while ago. - Okay. - I'll return later... - Wait! Excuse me, don't touch me, you're only a guard! - Let me take... - No, no, I'll give it to him myself. - The flowers look heavy, I'll give it. - No, thank you. - I wanna make sure he gets this. - I'll make sure! - Okay, make sure he'll receive these. - Yeah yeah. Annoying. What an annoying girl. Nice, I look good! Hey Rizette! - For you. - Thanks, there's no need for these. - Come inside for a bit. - Ah no. I just brought these because I know you're sick. - You're welcome here. - I need to go down and you need rest. - Eat those and get well soon. - Sure? - I bought those for you. - Okay, okay. I have to go. - Okay, I'll go. - Thank you. Is this real or another dream? You Thought... (Karaoke Version) NOTE: Translation is a bit based on the song timing, not with text on-screen. YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T SAW THAT YOU'RE HAPPY WHENEVER I'M HAPPY YOU THOUGHT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M PART OF YOUR EVERY DREAM I KNOW YOU LISTENED TO EVERY THING I SAID YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T SAW THEM YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU LOVE ME EVEN WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE IT YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU LOVE ME EVEN WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE IT YOU THOUGHT THOSE ARE TOO SIMPLE, I KNOW IT EVEN BEFORE YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE Here are the documents needed for the head start. - Leave them and I'll process it. - Okay, thank you. - If there's any issue, just call me. - Okay, no problem. Bye! Yes, hello! Hi Sweetie! A colleague of mine is so handsome! I'm losing myself when he's here! I really like him, too bad you're not seeing him. Too handsome! Bro, I just messed with the documents and we're just starting. Sis? How did you attract Eric? Why? Nothing. I'm just curious because he doesn't even notice you before. Maybe it's because when you're giving true love to someone, they'll reciprocate it. That's it. Is that so? Yeah. - Shooting star! There, there! - Shooting star! - What happ... - Quick! Make a wish! What's your wish? Nothing. Really? What is it? - Not sharing, it might not come true. - Unfair, why don't you tell it to me? - Why? - That won't come true. - It will! - That won't come true. - It will - I'll wish it won't come true. No! - Morning, sir! - Be seated. - The head start account is yours? - Yes sir. You know that it's one of our biggest account? Why? The head of purchasing department called furiously. Order placement is all wrong. Totally wrong costing! Wrong documentation! Botched first batch of delivery. How did that happen when I properly set things up? How did it happen? It's because you're sloppy! Boss, that's not true. I do my work properly. Could it be mistakes on accounting? I'll check it again but, I assure you this won't happen again. I know. I've made sure this won't happen. With the country's employment rate, a lot of people will want your position. I'll expect your resignation, first thing tomorrow. What? - I deserve an investigation. - What for? Because that might not be my doing. Someone may have sabotaged me! Someone might have messed up and you concluded it's me! I'm sorry. Sir, have you not considered that? Eric's fucked. I know you're behind it! Prove it. What happened to your car? Company car so I returned it. Really? - Can we talk? - Sure, but after my yoga class. Okay? No! Let's talk now! This is important. Don't yell at me! It's because you don't listen and believe me! You're prioritizing make-up and visiting the parlor. I lost my job and you're thinking about yoga. So what's the big deal? What's the problem? Find another job. And even if I don't attend my yoga class, doesn't change the fact that you're jobless. So don't divert your anger to me. Still wanna do this? - You don't understand me huh? - What do you mean by that? You. Think if you still want us together. Oh shit, I don't need you okay? Fine! I don't need you either! Go home by yourself! Ma'am, please accept me. My credentials are good. Sorry sir, we don't have any openings now. None. Apply again next time, we may have vacancy by then. Don't bug me! Don't call us, we'll call you! Thank you. Okay, thank you. Next! - Mr. De Leon. - Good morning ma'am. What's your plan? I don't know, I don't have any. Actually, you got two choices. Trip to Australia, or trip to Ateneo (school). Choose one. - Love? - Yes? Do you believe that you can get any thing through hard work? Yes. I need your suggestion... Will you love me if I'll work hard? Or I need to do it by force? Why can't I get Rizette through hard work? I don't care! What? What? Ah, I mean it's possible that you two aren't meant to be. Maybe. Love? - Yes? - When will you say yes to me? Soon. Really? Really soon? Today? - Rizette? - Yes ma'am? Mr. Francisco asked you to have an applicant sign then return it. Okay, thank you mam. - Good morning ma'am. - Good morning. Excuse me, miss. - Yes? - Is this where the application form is? Yes. Is it about being Mr. Francisco's executive assistant? Are these the papers? No, you're mistaken. It's not these. We've already hired someone. - Ha? - Someone's hired. But it's only 9 AM. The interviews will start at 9:30 AM. It's only 9 AM? No, it's 10... Good morning ma'am! It's already 10 AM. That means you are the weakest link. Goodbye. - Grumpy guard. - Eric, I need you here please. Excuse me! - Rizette! - Why? Why are you late? Fill this up using my pen then go inside. - It's all good? - Yeah, all good. - Thank you. - Hurry up! Yeah, that's it. Why would you leave when you already have a good job? - I just want to try new opportunities. - Hmm... okay. You have marketing experience... That's definitely a plus. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your interest. My assistant will get in touch with you. I'll be honored to be a part of your company, sir. Okay. Are there applicants left? I didn't see any, I can check it for you. No, no, it's okay. I'm just wondering why there are no other applicants. - Thanks anyway. - Okay sir. Ouch! - It hurts. - Sorry. Give me that. What are you doing here? I... I just wanna tell you I got the job. - Really? - Yeah! Congratulations! Why'd you have to surprise me like that? That aside, thanks because you saved me twice. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! - You're welcome and sorry I hit you. - Yeah, it kinda hurts. Look, your muscle's so big. I said sorry. - What now? - Let's go! Let's celebrate! Thank you. Good thing your uncle lent you this pickup. - He trusts you, huh. - Yeah, told him I'm applying for a job. I'm really happy today! What a great day! Yeah! Really happy! - I can feel your high energy here. - Ah, really? - Are you in good terms with your Mom? - Eh, not yet. But that's fine, I know she'll be happy for me. On my second salary, I'll treat you. Why not on your first one? Because I need the first salary for my enrollment. - So this isn't just job celebration. - Yeah. - Congratulations. - Thank you. But actually, I can easily ask Mom for money. She'll send some for sure, I know she won't say no. But I thought, someone's inspiring me now, to do all of these. It would be a shame if... I'll be lazy. Hmmm. The stars here looks good. Yeah I agree, there are lots of them in the sky. They're too many! It's cold. Yeah. Really cold. There, use your jacket. Oh okay. Let me. No this is mine, I'll take this home. - For our dog. - Ah okay. Alright. I feel like it's cold even with the jacket, because it's thin. Even if it's denim, it's thin... - It's that cold? - Yeah. Here. Oops. There. I'm fine! - You're good? - Yes. You're right, it's cold. Marie? Eric? - Hi. - Hi. How's life? Doing fine. You look different. Thanks. Eric, about the last time... I'm sorry for the bad break-up. Anyway... - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. Forget it. What's new? I'm in a travel agency now. And you? All good. I'm in Core 24 agency now. - Really? - Here's my card. What are you doing in a financing company? It's only part-time. Miss, I'll pay for her items. But you're good at car sales. Remember my uncle Sammy? He's a car dealer. He opened a showroom in Alabang and needs a staff. Are you interested? Better pay! - Why not? - Okay, okay. I'll give him a call and I'll let you know. Okay. So... - It's nice seeing you. - Nice seeing you too. - Bye. - Bye. - Marriage? - Of course, avoiding jinx. Make sure to free up your Friday. - Why? - We'll be on Beauty and Jun's wedding. Is that on Friday? Yes. Beauty's in a hurry, Jun might, change his mind. How many photos do you need? Six pieces for 1x1 and two pieces for 2x2, for office files and application. Application? Yeah. Miss, miss! I need six 1x1 and two 2x2 but we need a photo together. - Is that possible? - Yes. - We'll have a photo together? - Yes! It's ready. - Let's go. - Enter the booth. Let me take off your bag. I'll enter. Sit on my lap. - I'll sit there? - Yeah. - Really? - Go. Marie told me about a job opening, probably a better job. - Why not try it, you'll lose nothing. - I agree with you. Same thoughts. You know, Marie changed a lot. She's my ex-girlfriend. You already met her, you know her. - I think I do... - That pretty girl visiting me. - You know her? - Yeah. I'm thinking, of courting her again. - What? - Ready! Smile! I should've stabbed you! - What? - Nothing! Ah okay. Miss, the solo shots. - Is it ready? - Yes. - I'll just press it? - Yes. Sorry. Sorry. I'm really sorry for being late. Okay okay, just drive because we're late. My uncle's waiting for us already. It'll be quick, right? I need to leave immediately. Okay. Or I'll just... take a cab after it. Okay. - Jun, hurry up! The judge will leave. - Wait! I'll be there! - Beauty! You're beautiful today! - Thank you! Please wait... No need, Eric will drive for us. He left already. - Where did he go? - I don't know. He's in Marie's car. Are we talking to you?! Let's go, let's go. I just asked the judge to wed us quickly. Driver, please take us to the city hall. Go! Drive straight! Here's the paper. - Jun and Beauty? - Yes... Is that your real name? Yes, because that's what my parents saw when I was born. Alright. Remember this day. - Remember why you wanna get married. - Yes. Remember your feelings for each other. I hope you won't return after a year, asking for an annulment. That won't happen doc, I mean judge, honor, miss. Let's start now please. Okay. One of the secrets of a good, marriage is loving your partner, more than you love yourself. You treasure your partner more than yourself. It's also how, you can show that you truly, love your partner. Can you love her like that, Jun? Yes. That's why I'm here and I didn't run away... it's because I really love Beauty. - Yes, we love each other. - Okay. Okay, let's start. Beauty Iruma, do you accept Jun Bacud, as your husband, for better or for worst... Mark, I'll just get my belongings. Go on, no one's using that locker. ...that's really something... I told you, you should be in car sales. I owe you one. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Rizette? Rizette? Rizette. Please wait. Is it done? Yeah. I don't know how I'll tell you this but... I had a long chat with my new boss, that's why... I wasn't able to attend. Rizette, I'm sorry. It's fine. Okay. Rizette, I'm really really sorry. Don't be sorry. It's all fine. You don't need to apologize because, it's not your fault. I looked like a fool. A crazy girl who... I don't know... What do you mean? Let me finish what I'm saying. I might forget this... This won't let me sleep at night. I'm... I'm mad, because, I'm mad because I thought we both... I thought we share the same feeling, you know? My mistake. It's nothing... I just thought... I thought that... it's possible. - I don't know... - Rizette. Rizette. - I don't understand... - No! Let me finish please. I'll be done in a bit. Let me take your time. You're really kind to me. So... so I thought it was something else. That's it. Also, you're too handsome, you make me weak... I'll have to go. Oh, there you are. I'm constipated. Ah, feels good. You're stargazing again? You know, sis, what you said was right. When you meet the person meant for you... Heaven! Kid's giggling again. Any problem? Why? I'll take any night shift. School starts early morning. Okay, I'll find you one. Thank you. Send my regards to your mom and dad. I'll let them know. Hey. Hi Rhea. Hi. I still don't know how you tricked me here. I got good convincing powers. So where's your cousin that I'll be meeting? Wait a minute... It's you? I thought you were referring to your cousin. Ahhh, yes! The thing is, she suddenly had plans. Since you're already here, I volunteered. Ahh. Okay okay. I was a bit nervous. What if it's really me? You know, I thought you might be infatuated to me. That happens a lot to teenagers like you... attracted to older men, and they'll think it's love. You're not even my type. That's a relief. I thought you're serious. Look at you, you're too young. You're like my little sister. I don't want to be jailed for corruption of minors. So, let's order? Waiter! Who are you? Who are you? Rhea? What are you doing here? You've scared me. Why are you crying? Any problem? Sis, please explain... I thought being in love, feels like heaven... Why do I feel like hell? Tell me what happened. Nothing. Then there's nothing to talk about. In love? Is that what you're keeping from me? Yes... with Joey! So he's the guy. He's the reason why you're with Dad when he's buying ducks? You haven't learned a thing from me. - Serves you right. - Sis. You know me, you're my idol since I'm a kid. You're still young. I don't want to fall in love again. But being in love feels really good. So good as if you're on drugs. It hits different, you feel "high". But once it's over, it feels being in a rehab... for ten years. Is that what you felt? Nah. Actually, no. Worse than that. It hurts because, I'm happy just seeing Eric. I'm happy even with... just touching his cigar's butt. I can die happily with that. As long as it's from Eric, I'll worship it like crazy. But, it came to a point where he's within reach. So close that... I felt like I can reach and touch him. That point, where I thought he can love me back. But he can't. It hurts because... I love him. Stop crying. So, this resto's your favorite? Well... - What are you doing? - Ma'am, sorry... Sorry. It's because you're stupid! - Let me help, that's fine. - I can do it sir. It's fine. Let him clean! Where's you manager? I need to talk to him! No need, that's too much. Go, I got this. - Why stop me? He deserves it! - No! Nobody deserves it! He's embarrassed and you're mocking him? I'll leave. You won't understand me anyway. Where are you going? Rox? The lights! This isn't fun! Rox? Rox, don't make fun of me! Who are you? Stop it! Wait! Wait! It's me, Eric! You always bring misfortune! Why are you here? What do you need from me? Lost your phone again? Someone stole it? You got flat tires? What else? Need a job? We need a guard because I'll be promoted as a supervisor. Rizette, Rizette! - Why? - Why? It's hard to surprise you! Why do you have to? I'm here to tell you that I broke up with Marie. So what? What's new? How many girls, have you dumped before? - No, there's nothing new... - Shhh. Look at me. Look up here. - Rizette, listen. - Stop! Listen to what I'll say. Okay. I'm here because, because I'm not the person you used to know. Really? Rizette. A lot has changed since we last talked. I had so much realizations. And we both know that I owe you my life, because you saved me. This is like from a drama. - I'm not done yet. - Okay fine. I'm indebted when you, loved me for who I am, and because of that, let me return what you did to me. I'll even outdo your efforts. Just give me a chance. Rizette. I don't know if, you'll still accept and believe me but, regardless if you do or don't, I want you to know that... I really love you. Love? I just realized it... Why just now? I know it long ago, I knew... Knew what? Knew that I love you! Remember the night we're on the pickup truck? YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T SAW THAT Yeah, why YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T SAW THAT There isn't a falling star back then YOU'RE HAPPY WHENEVER I'M HAPPY YOU THOUGHT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M PART OF YOUR EVERY DREAM I KNOW YOU LISTENED TO EVERY THING I SAID YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T SAW IT YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU LOVE ME EVEN WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE IT YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T HEAR YOUR HEARTBEAT AND EXCITEMENT YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T FEEL THAT I HAVE SOMEONE TO BE WITH ON HAPPINESS, SADNESS YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE WHEN I NEED YOU YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T SAW IT YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU LOVE ME EVEN WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE IT YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU LOVE ME EVEN WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE IT YOU THOUGHT THOSE ARE TOO SIMPLE, I KNOW IT EVEN BEFORE YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T NOTICE custom subtitles made from scratch by RSG for KG Don't re-upload elsewhere.
