(children chattering) RAMONA: My name's Ramona Q. I'm nine and three months, and no matter what my sister Beezus tells you, I'm not a pest. My dad says I just have an overactive imagination, which does come in handy. It makes the fun parts funner and the scary parts scarier. And frankly, it's good to scare yourself once in a while, 'cause if you can't be brave at recess, how can you do it when it really counts? Okay, stay with me. You can do it, Ramona. (shrieking and laughing) I'll never make it, Howie. Whoa. Owie, owie. (laughing) RAMONA: That's my echo off the canyon, canyon, canyon. Don't psych yourself out, Ramona. Just don't look down. (gasping) It's too far! (echoing) Far! Far! Far! (Ramona whimpering) (gasping) (bell ringing) (screaming) Howie, help! -Mrs. Meacham? -(chalk squeaking) Uh, Ramona's kind of hung up. (chairs screech) -Help, please. -(students laughing) -(laughing continues) -Quiet. Face front. Ah! Help. MRS. MEACHAM: Eyes forward. Lock it down. MRS. MEACHAM: Ramona Quimby, get down from there. This isn't a circus. (students laughing) (laughing louder) HOWIE: You should have seen it through a window. It was awesome. You looked like a piñata. Well, obviously without all the candy. RAMONA: It made me really dizzy, yet I wanna do it again. -Race you home, mudball. -(laughing) -RAMONA: I won! -HOWIE: See you tomorrow. -Bye, Howie. -WILLA JEAN: Excuse me. (shrieks, grunts) -Ramona. -(giggling) Be more careful with Willa Jean. -Huh? -She's younger than you are. -Ha-ha! -(tricycle bell dings) -Ow. -Willa Jean, come to Grammy. (gasps) (groaning) (groaning) (babbling) (laughs) Mom, look it! I taught Roberta how to stick out her tongue. That's great, sweetie. Now I can cancel the private tutor. (giggles) Next, can you teach her how to change her own diaper? Oh, could you set the table, please, Ramona? And add another plate for Aunt Bea. She's coming by later for dessert. -So, five altogether? -Yep. Um, I was about to do that. Hmm. Being about to do it and doing it. (speaking French) Mom! Beezus is acting all French again. (car alarm beeps) Dad's home! (giggles) Daddy! Prepare for impact! -(grunts) -(laughing) -DOROTHY: Hi, honey! -Dad! Hey! How are my beautiful girls? Mwah! -Did you crunch the numbers, Dad? -You bet I did, Pickle. -I crunched them good. Real good. -(squeals) -The whole darn day. -(giggles) I don't think you got dirty enough today, Ramona. Well, there's always tomorrow. -Mwah! -I'll let you two catch up. There's my little girl. My little bowling ball with legs. -(cat shrieks) -Sorry about that, Icky Sticky. (giggles) Dad, it's Picky Picky. When are you ever gonna learn his real name? When he learns mine. So, Beezus, suppose I told you that when I pulled up in front of the house tonight, I saw your old buddy Henry staring at it like he left something important inside. Henry Huggins? I haven't heard that name in a while. Isn't he the boy that used to eat dirt in the backyard? -Yeah. -He doesn't do that anymore. Ooh. If I didn't know better, I'd say somebody has a crush. -Ooh-ooh! -Can we please talk about something else? Nope. There is that dance coming up. Maybe he wants to ask you to it. Well, if he's gonna ask my girl to a dance, he'd better have some moves. Can the old dirt-eater do this? Ooh-hoo, whoo-hoo! (blowing, popping lips) Oh, I hope not. Stop. -Mom! -(laughing) ROBERT: What do we got here? Note from the bank. It could be loan papers for the addition. -Hope they don't expect us to pay it back. -Well, banks are funny that way. What do we got here? "To the Parents of Beatrice Quimby." Could this be the latest report card? "Beatrice Quimby gets in fights, steals from the vending machines, counterfeits hall passes." -Wait. Let me see. -"We recommend juvenile prison." (laughs) All A's. -We're so proud of you. -♪ Proud of you ♪ -It's not funny. -♪ We're so proud of you ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ So, Ramona, Beatrice has her report card. Doesn't that mean-- I don't know-- you should have one too? (scoffs) That old thing? Yeah, that old thing. Where would that old thing happen to be? -That's a good place for it. -Yeah, wouldn't want it to spoil. (chuckles) Oh. "Ramona is a bright young student"-- That's my girl. "...but lacks focus, often daydreams, disputes the need to spell words correctly and has very little respect for the rules of grammar or rules in general." (giggles) Oh. Why would she write this, Ramona? Because... she's no fun. -That is no excuse. -But it's true. She makes us all use the same words from the same list. And when I try to be original, she just shoots me down. Like when I invented the word "terrifical." She goes, "Ramona, that's not a word." And I say, "It's a lot funner word to say." She goes, "'Funner' isn't a word either." What kind of teacher is that? She can't tell kids not to invent words. She's not the president of the world. -(laughing) -You butt out, Beezus. Ramona, Mrs. Meacham is your teacher. -You need to listen to her. -And she's not that bad. I mean, she was fair with me when I was your age. Yeah, well-- Everybody loves Beezus, -(bangs table) -...and everybody hates me! -(laughs) -BEEZUS: Okay. -Why are you laughing? -We're not laughing, sweetie. I'm gonna say a bad word. -You are? -Mm-hmm. A really bad one. Well, if you feel the need to get one out of your system, then go ahead. -Guts! -(meows) -Guts, guts, guts! -(Roberta coos) -(snickering) -(all laughing) "G" word. That's your idea of a bad word, Ramona? (coos) (knocking) -(doorknob rattles) -(knocking) Honey, I'm sorry we laughed. -(squishing) -Hey. (knocking) (squishing continues) (grunts) (door slams) Oh, oh, oh. (Roberta cooing) What's she done? (gasps) (laughs, grunts) -Oh, guts! -(laughs) Hey, babe. How's the air up there? Hi, Aunt Bea. Aw, you can do better than that. -Where's the love? Honk, honk. -(laughs) I thought I'd find you here. That was a fine job you did on the toothpaste. You must have a really strong grip. Oh! Let me see those calluses. Oh, yeah. All that time on the jungle gym sure is paying off. Did that one get bigger? Tremendous. Trophy size. You know, I was a younger sister, too, once, still am. No matter how old I get, I'll always be younger. (chuckles) It's no fair, Aunt Bea. I never do anything as good as Beezus. -And Roberta, if she burps, it's adorable. -Hmm. Last week, she poured applesauce on her head, -and dad stopped to take pictures. -Oh! I mean, when it's my turn to do stuff, nobody even cares. Well, it's impossible to compete with pouring food on your head. Why do we even bother? You know what I bet? I bet it would be nice to have something of your own for once. Like my own room? Maybe just something small... you could always have with you. Go ahead. Open it. (gasps) I found that picture the other day, and I realized I was exactly your age, so I wanted you to have it. -That's you? -(laughs) Yeah. And look, there's room for another if you wanna give that little girl some company. -Thank you, Aunt Bea. -Mm-hmm. I want you to know... that you will always have me around. -Aw. -BOTH: Whoo! (laughing) You okay? -(laughing) -I gotcha. Mmm. I gotcha.

Whoa! -(screams) -♪ Walking on sunshine ♪ -This is the best day ever! -Whoo-hoo! Yeah. I wish we had a hole in our house. Hey, Ramona, let's make a deal. If you can settle down for a few hours, I'll see if dad can take us out to dinner. -(gasps) -Really? -Can we go to Macaroni Joe's? -(whines) There is an inch of dust covering my whole kitchen. -We can go anywhere. -Yeah! Whoo! I'm having a hair crisis. But it looks the same as always. Thanks. Thanks a lot. -(car alarm chirping) -He's home! -Dad. -Hey. Daddy! -Boing! -Ohh! -(exhales) -Did you crunch the numbers, dad? Well, today they kind of crunched me back. But I got you a little surprise. Why don't you and Beez go outside and share those... and I'll talk to your mom for a minute, okay? -Let's go. -Thank you. (sighs) (sighs) -(parents speaking, indistinct) -Something's wrong. ROBERT: They let three people go last week. How can you tell? 'Cause they're whispering. Did I do something wrong? No. Not this time. But something tells me that we're not going to Macaroni Joe's. Hey, you got more red ones. All right. Take a few more. Remember how I taught you to eat them. -Bite the head off first? -Yep. It's more humane that way. DOROTHY: You don't deserve to be downsized. (exhales) "Downsized"? What's that mean? Well, um, it means the storage company was bought by a bigger one, and a lot of people were let go, including dad. The good news is I called Dr. Perry's office, and she has some part-time work for me again, so that should tide us over for a little while, at least. ROBERT: Don't worry. I will find a job. But in the meantime, I got a little extra time to spend with my girls. Right? -Right? -Right. -Okay. -Right. You realize we're gonna be poor now, right? No, we're not. -Are we? -Have you seen how many bills they get? It's insane. Everything costs money, even water. Well, Mom's gonna make money. And Dad, he'll be with us. That part's fun. Well, get ready for another year in hand-me-down heaven. (sighs) Hey, lights out, my lovelies. Sweet dreams. (wind whistling) Beezus? (wind whistling) It's sort of scary having a hole in the house, don't you think? -Beezus. -Shh. I'm trying to sleep. (wind whistling) Beezus, did you hear that growling? It's probably just your stomach, doofus. Unless-- Unless it's something... else. Beezus, stop it. -Like a ferocious, hungry-- -Stop! slithering beast that feeds on pests with bad report cards. -Ah! -(screams) (laughing) You're too easy. Beezus, it's not funny. I thought it was. (chuckling) Bring it up. (tool whirring) ROBERT: Okay, let me get a pen. Let me write this down. DOROTHY: Both girls get carrots and sandwiches. -Okay. -Beezus wants hers in a Ziploc, and Ramona insists on having tin foil. She claims it affects the taste, but I think she just likes making sculptures with it. What else? Ramona wants a hard-boiled egg if we have any. Think fast. Please tell me you're gonna remember all this. Look at me-- fully domesticated. (laughs) I've lined up Mrs. Kemp to watch Roberta at noon. All you have to do is go nail this interview today. How do I look? -I'd give you the job. -ROBERT: Really? I'd take it. (groans) -Ew! -Ew! Ramona, did I ever show you the proper way... to crack a hard-boiled egg? Mm-mmm. Hmm-hmm. -(blowing) -(gasps) You are so weird. (laughing) -A guy's gotta get his protein somehow. -(laughs) -(laughing) -See, I got this stuff down. Hey, Ramona, wait up! -RAMONA: Bye, Dad! -Bye-bye! -(giggles) -Nice doodles. They're not doodles. They're sketches. My dad's extremely sketchy. (snickers) MRS. MEACHAM (clears throat): Is everyone in their seats? I'm about to round the corner. And good morning. I trust you all survived the weekend with most of your limbs intact. It's time we tackle our class reports. Tell us about something special in your life... using at least one word from our vocabulary list. This is my ballet tiara. Ooh. This is a saddle for riding camels. It's special to me because I'm going to wear my tiara... when I audition for the part of the princess in the Royal Peanut Butter commercials. And it's special because my Uncle Hobart gave it to me. I think I'd be extraordinary in the role. E-X-T-R-A-O-R-D-I-N-A-R-Y. And he travels all over the world, taking pictures of animals in their natural habitat. H-A-B-I-T-A-T. Extraordinary. That's when you take something... ordinary... -and give it a little extra. -(students laugh) -So, does anybody wanna sit on it? -STUDENTS: Yeah! -Okay, Ramona, let's hear it. -Why, thank you, Mrs. Meacham. (laughs) -(students laughing) -MRS. MEACHAM: Shh. Mute button. Mute button. What am I doing? I'm muting you. Ramona, go on. Well, the most special thing in my life is that some nice workmen in blue helmets -came to my house this week-- -MRS. MEACHAM: Shh. -and chopped a great big hole in it. -(students laughing) But, but they did. It was so big, I could see all of Portland. (students laughing) I mean, Howie knows. Howie came and jumped through the hole. Um-- He did. -(laughing) -MRS. MEACHAM: That's enough now. -I think the hole's in her head. -(laughing) -MRS. MEACHAM: Show's over, Ramona. -BOY: She's such a liar. -Mrs. Meacham, I'm not lying. -Take your seat. Go ahead. Take your seat. The purpose of this exercise is not to entertain us. No embellishments, please. Now, who would like to go next? Hands? You saw them chop the hole in my house. Actually, no. They pried it with crowbars. Technically, they pried it. That's what I meant. Now, Mrs. Meacham thinks I'm a liar, and she's gonna tell my mom and dad I'm a big troublemaker tonight. Well, you are sometimes. I mean, technically, you are. Maybe you should technically look for a new best friend. -(gasps) -Hey! How you doing there, chief? Who's your girlfriend? G-- I'm not his girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend. She's Ramona, and she lives over there. Ramona. ♪ Ramona and Howie are sitting in a tree ♪ ♪ They are K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪ Wait a second. Ramona Quimby? Huh. Hey, I'm Hobart. I'm Howie's favorite uncle. No? Oh. Sorry. Yeah. We all heard about it. Oh, really? Well, how's that beautiful Aunt Beatrice of yours doing? You be sure to tell her I'd love to catch up, all right? Hey, Howie, how'd the saddle work out? Did you get an "A"? (door closes) Dad? Does Aunt Bea really know some weird guy named Hobart? Hobart? That's a name I haven't heard in quite a while. Yeah, they were high school sweethearts, old Hobart and Bea. Him? But he's not even her type. And what would that type be? Perfect. Hmm. Oh, I'm afraid to look. Bills, bills, bills. It never ends, Pickle. Did you get the job today? -Well, I didn't get this one. -Oh. 'Cause I was thinking. I've got the perfect job. -What? -You should be a fireman. Oh. Yeah? Yes. I mean, you would save people's lives... and climb gigantic ladders. And if it was a night alarm, you would get to put your fire suit on over your pajamas. -Whoa. -It's true, Dad. I took a field trip. Well, I want to work in my pajamas, but I think you're overestimating my job skills a little bit. I'm not that versatile. -Dad. -What? I think you can do anything. Don't you? Well... -(door opens) -DOROTHY: Hi! I'm home! -We need to be there by 5:00, honey. -Oh. You know, I've heard those parent-teacher meetings can be really boring. They make your brain numb, they're that boring. -Nice try, Ramona. We're going. -Yeah. Good one, Pickle. Honey, I want to call the bank tomorrow and cancel the loan. -Bob, there's a gaping hole in the house. -(meows) I don't think we have much choice. ROBERT: We're in over our heads. Let's wait till we're on our feet. Beezus, what are they talking about? -We just have to finish it. -(exhales) Hey. And if we default? I'd rather sell it than let the bank take the house. (echoing) Bank take the house. Bank take the house. -(rumbling) -(gasps) -(crane beeping) -(gasps) (screams) (all gasp) (horn honking) (Ramona whimpering) -(crying) Our house. -(Picky Picky meows) -Can we just talk about this later, Bob? -Okay, fine. -We're late. -Mom, wait. No more stalling. We're meeting with Mrs. Meacham, end of story. -Hmm? -Be good, lovelies. -Mwah! -And be good for Aunt Bea tonight. We're off to numb our brains. Beezus, where's the bank gonna take our house? It's just an expression, genius. They don't take it anywhere. -Oh. -They just sell it to someone else. -What? -(phone rings) -I got it. -(beeps) -Hello. Oh, hi, Henry. -Beezus, we can't move. This is our house. We belong here. I-I don't want us to leave Klickitat Street. Ramona, I am on the phone. (doorbell rings) Aunt Bea! -Can I, can I ask you something? -Shh. Just a minute, babe. What's wrong? I just thought I recognized someone out there. Oh. You mean Hobart. Hmm. Sounds like you've met him. He said he wants to catch up with you. (exhales) You're kidding. -He said that to you? -Mm-hmm. Well, that's just-- That's just classic. (horn honking) Aunt Bea, can I ask you something? I think the bank's gonna take our house. -Aunt Bea? -Huh? -Are you listening? -Hmm? Oh. I'm sorry. I just-- (exhales) How do I put this? Um, you know those calluses on your hands? Yeah. Mm-hmm. How the skin gets tough to protect a spot that got hurt? I have one of those on my heart from a really long time ago. And if he thinks he can just come back here and start picking at it, he is sadly mistaken. RAMONA: I guess you're the only one left to talk to. I'm sorry for pulling your tail when I was little... and for trying to teach you how to play catch... and for dressing you up as an astronaut. -(purrs) -I know you're really old, so, I'm gonna say this gently. We're in a lot of trouble, Picky Picky. We need money. And we might lose our house. -(purrs) -But don't worry, okay? I'm gonna help. Nobody thinks I can, but I can. I can be extraordinary. -(meows) -I'm glad we agree. Whoa. (giggles) Whoo! Whoo! (flies buzzing) Ramona, why is my desk on the lawn? It's a secret. Okay, fine. I'll tell you. I'm saving the house for Mom and Dad. Is that Great Grandma's crystal? Ramona, we never use that. I know. We're gonna make so much money today, Beezus. Now, if you wanna join the team, I could always use a hardworking sales associate. Um, is that "delicious"? -Mm-hmm! -Ah. Ooh! Customer! Customer! (gasps) Ramona, please, please, please, don't call him over-- Hey, Henry, you look thirsty! -Hi. -Hi, Henry. Hey, Beezus. Hi. (laughs) Selling lemonade? Oh yeah. Just helping out my little sister. -(grunts) -Like the uniform? Well, the last time I saw you in pajamas, we were playing sheep in the Christmas pageant. But, yeah, it's a good look for you. Huh. Right. Yeah. Baa! Baa! But I think you spilled something on your shirt there. -Oh. -(laughs) Gotcha. (clears throat) Hello! Delicious lemonade, anyone? I-- Yeah, I'll have one. -You will? -Yeah. Well, that'll be one dollar, please. Exact change preferred. Oh, Ramona, Henry doesn't have to pay. -Beezus, it's for the house. -Uh, she meant "on the house." No charge. Here. -But, Beezus-- -Thank you. -Beezus! -Shh. -(fly buzzing) -Beezus! -I said, shh. -But, Beezus-- Beezus, that won't taste-- (whimpers) good. Oh! RAMONA: She's right. No charge for that. I wanna die! Just let me die! I hate my life! -Beezus? -No. Go away. Get out. Get out. But... what did I do that was so bad? You embarrassed me in front of Henry. If I didn't know better, I'd swear you were actually trying to ruin my life. You run around like a nutball. You don't care what anybody thinks. And you even stuck me with my stupid nickname. But I was just a baby then, and I meant to call you Beatrice. It just came out... wrong. Yeah, tell me about it. How can I be normal with a name like Beezus? Who could ever love a girl named Beezus? Jesus? Get out! Mrs. Pitt, would you care for a car wash today? My car is in the shop today, deary. -Wash your car? -Just washed it myself. Please let me wash your car, please! (thuds) Are you the pizza man? No. Hey, babe. Hey. How's business? -I'm considering retirement. -(squeaks) (chuckles) AUNT BEA: Ramona's not a quitter. (grunts) Mwah! -(whistling) -Is he still out there? Doesn't he have anything better to do than tinker with his precious Jeep? Oh, look at him. (scoffs) He thinks he can flash those hazel eyes and that smug little smile... and just reel me back in again. -Reel you back in? -Yeah. -Like a sea bass. -Ew. -I know. Exactly. -(wrench clicking) Here's what we do. We head straight to the house, looking confident and radiant, so Hobart gets a good look at everything he missed out on, okay? -Okay. -I'm so glad I wore my good jeans. -Ready to strut? -I think so. -Hmm. -But what if he tries to talk to us? -We ignore him. -Got it. Strut and ignore. Mm-hmm. Mm-mmm! Keep up the good work. -RAMONA: Mm-mmm-mmm. -Mm-mmm. -WILLA JEAN: Excuse me. -Oh! (screams) (giggles) AUNT BEA: Good, Bea. Real smooth. How are you doing there, Beatrice? There we go. -You got a little-- -No. You gotta watch out for that cross traffic, ladies. What's the rush? We're ignoring you. Now, why would you wanna do that? So nobody gets reeled in like a sea bass. -Oh! Like the fish? -Mm-hmm. Huh. Well, we'll make sure that doesn't happen. But it would be nice to find some time to catch up with your Aunt Bea. I think we just did. Excuse us. (Ramona clears throat) Keep struttin', Aunt Bea. You're doing good. Hey, Ramona! That Jeep of mine could sure use a wash, don't you think? The poor thing's been sitting in the garage for 15 years now, Bea? How much to hose her off? Fifty dollars. -Fifty d-- No. No, no, no. -Mm-hmm. No, I would never take advantage of you like that, Ramona. That Jeep is my pride and joy. Okay, I tell you what. For you to wash it, and a "delishus" custom hand-wash at that, I'm gonna have to insist on, uh-- Oh, I don't know-- an even... hundred bucks? Really? Yeah. Really. Not a penny less. One hundred dollars? -Yeah. -Whoo! Oh, just, uh, one little condition. Bea gets to chat with me. Yeah, we can sit inside, like the old car washes. -What do you say, Bea? -(laughs) Like I said, it'd be nice to catch up. (whispering) Please, please, please. How fast can you wash his car? -Milady. -Huh. I'm regretting this already. (chuckling) -(laughing) -Oh. It's like time stood still in here. -I'd swear I was back in high school. -Mm-hmm. -The good old days. (chuckles) -(laughs) I wouldn't mind going back for a while. Maybe I could, you know, figure out where I messed up. Oh, ancient history. I've moved on. Yeah, I'll say. RAMONA: Back off, Romeo. -(giggles) -I think she likes me. Don't bet on it. (laughs) Stay cool, Aunt Bea. So, I'll be heading off to Alaska in a few weeks. After I get this thing up and running, I am back on the road... and out of your hair for the next few years. Well, my hair thanks you. But it was inspired of you, bribing my niece just to talk to me, Mr. Moneybags. Well, a hundred bucks is a bargain. You know, between you and me, I was willing to go much higher. Oh, really? (laughs) Times have changed. This from the guy who bought me a ring for my sweet 16... straight from a gum ball machine. -Oh, yeah. That's right. -I even had to lend you the quarter. (sighs) You know, let's face it. I wanted that ring to be real. You always knew it was disposable. Just you and me in a nutshell. Yeah. Coming through. Ooh! What do we have here? (gasps) Oh, no! -"You and Me Forever Mix"? -Oh, Hobart! Could these be the romantic stylings of the young Beatrice? Oh, don't play it. Oh, Hobart, that's embarrassing. -Please don't play it. -Of course, I'm gonna play it. -This is so embarrassing. -(soft rock music plays) Uh-uh. Oh!

(screams) -(whimpers) -I'm afraid to look. -(scoffs) -ROBERT: No, no, no, no. The surface was wet. He tried hosing it off. How do we get it off without damaging the paint job underneath? Okay. And if we bring it in, how much? Ballpark? What is that, hundreds? -Thousands? -No. No. Try this guy. (Robert sighs) Well, this is gonna cost us a fortune. ROBERT: Hello. I'd-- Yes, I'll hold. I-- I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. -You're sorry? -Mm-hmm. Uh, I'm sorry, because now that I'm looking at it from a distance, I realize that I should be thanking you. I mean, look at it. It's-- It's camouflaged. And from what I hear, the icy Alaskan terrain looks-- looks just like that. So, I can just sneak right up on those polar bears. I don't even have to get out of my Jeep. (chuckles) Well, I'm-- I'm glad you like it? -I love it. -ROBERT: Hey, Hobart, are you crazy? -You're not gonna leave it like that. -No, no, no. No, no. I paid for something "delishus," and look what I got-- an Easter egg. What do you think, Bea? That a good look for me? BEA: Hmm. Sure. It might even bring out your sensitive side. (mouths words) ROBERT: Next time we clean the neighbor's garage, it's coming out of your allowance, not mine, Picasso. For your records, my dear. Now I have less money than I started with, and I started with zero. How about you focus on things around the house instead? Like being a good helper, getting along with your sisters. I can feed Roberta, Mommy. Don't worry about a thing. I'll do it. Okay. Here's the peas and a spoon. Work some magic. ROBERT: That's my girl. (cooing) Ooh, look! Here comes the... intergalactic space lava. Ramona, she's an infant. She doesn't know what intergalactic space lava is. -I don't even know what that is. -Oh, you butt out, Beez-- Uh, I mean, thank you for your feedback. I love feedback. Love it. -Any progress today? -(clears throat) Yeah. I, um-- I got a couple of leads, but... I don't know if I'm executive material anymore. Could be time to try something else. -Like what? -Fireman! Fireman, fireman. Fireman. I don't know. You know, something creative. Uh-- I used to be a creative guy. Yeah, well, if you find a job that pays you to be creative and have fun, then maybe you can give them my résumé too. Guess what! It's picture day tomorrow. Oh! That's good. Seeing your picture always cheers me up. Me, too. Then I'll make sure it's the best picture ever, ever. It'll be... dazzling. We expect nothing less. Say "peas." "Peas, please." Mom, look.

My mom lets me pick out my own clothes. We can tell. Excuse me. What are you doing? I'm loading my grape-a-pult. Watch and learn. And what was the purpose of that?

I'm not saying that energy's bad. It's just you gotta learn how to control it. I mean, come on, let's be honest here.

I don't think school's a good call right now. Oh. You're in a suit. Do you have an interview? Well, yeah, but I can change it if we have to. Are you queasy sick or achy sick? Well, I'm kind of feeling better now. You sure? Okay, well, let's go.

We've got sprinkler pipes down there. Oh, is that what I keep hitting? (laughs) Don't worry, Mom. Relax. It's okay. MRS. KEMP: Oh! -HOBART: Good talk. -HOWIE: What do you think he's doing? (whispering) Maybe he's digging a secret tunnel to Istanbul. A spy network right through your very own backyard. Or maybe this house was built on an old burial ground, and I'm unlocking an ancient curse. (growling, grunting) (screaming) (giggling) Open call? That means anybody can audition, right? Mm-hmm.

Everybody else, take five. Ramona! What was that about? "Rough at home"? Well, your dad lost his job, didn't he? Maybe. Look, when people lose their jobs, you know, they start fighting, and then they get a divorce and sell their houses. It's textbook. Look at the bright side, Ramona. I mean, after my dad got laid off, my mom sold her house, got a real estate license, so there's a plus. And then my dad got a new car and moved to Tacoma. Tacoma? Susan, I'm so sorry. Well, now on my birthdays, they both give me checks, so it works out. -(guitar music playing) -(groans) MAN: Okay. Hey, Ramona? Would you mind taking your seat again? What are you doing by the window there? I was-- I was wondering, where is Tacoma?

You get comfortable in there. (grunts) (engine cranking) Come on. -(cranking continues) -Oh! Come on! (grunting) You're kidding me. Try this one. Okay. No, no. That's no good. I think this one's gonna be good. How'd the interview go today, Daddy? Well, I had to cancel the interview when the nurse called. But there's other jobs out there. Hey, we're not gonna let one bad day get us down. Let's do somethin'... really special. Just me and you. What would you like to do? Think big. Well, you know that big bridge we took when we went to Washington State? Yeah. I've always wanted to stop in the middle... and have one foot in Oregon and one in Washington. Hmm? That way my legs have dual citizenship. (chuckles) I like it. That's interesting. Interesting notion. Not practical because the car's kaput, but you're on the right track. I mean, it's bold, it's daring, it's fairly inexpensive. Come on. Give me-- What else? We could draw it. Oh! I've got an idea. Let's me and you draw the longest picture in the world. What do you think? (imitates brake squeal) Okay. I'm gonna draw our house, and I'm gonna draw Howie's house... and school and Mount Hood... and everything else as far as I can see. -Daddy? -Hmm? I think you draw better than anybody in the whole world. Oh. Well, thank you, Pickle. You know, I studied art back in the day, as they say. What happened? Did you get a bad report card? (chuckles) No. Beezus came along. Then I took the best job I could, and before you know it, I was a vice president. -Then I came along? -Yep. That's right. And then Roberta. But I wouldn't change a thing. You girls make my life very colorful. (chattering, laughing) -Hi. Hey, Beezus. -Hey. -Wanna walk home? -Sure. Cool. HENRY (laughing): Oh, man. When we were kids, I thought your dad was, like, the king of Klickitat Street. Do you remember that gorilla hunt in my backyard when he made us set up the tents and wait there all night with bananas and butterfly nets? You ended up with mashed bananas in your hair. I had poison ivy all over me. But it was also-- The best time we had that whole summer. Hands down. Yeah, well, he's not as funny these days. Why? What's going on? He lost his job a few weeks ago, and he acts like he's not worried, for our sake, but I can tell he is. And he should be. What if he doesn't get something that he likes? What if he has to settle for something that he hates... because of... us? Beezus, that's a big deal. -Why didn't you tell me? -I don't know. I don't know. Sometimes... things feel different between us. Like it's not as easy to talk to you as it used to be, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I guess. A little. It's not that I don't want to talk to you-- No, no. I get you. -It's just very different. -Different. Exactly. Oh, gosh. Um-- Yeah. Thank you. You should probably button that. Oh. Yeah. It's good to know some things never change.

You look great. Hello, Ramona. Susan! How could you be a princess without your tiara? -Hi, Mrs. Kushner. -Hello, Ramona. Okay. Let's go. That looks beautiful. (exhales) -Excuse me! Aunt Bea, I need a tiara! -(Bea laughing) It takes a real man to be able to drive around in this. Oh, by the way, I talked to my publisher. He found me an apartment in Anchorage. Very spacious. Got great views. Room for two. Well. Maybe you can find a nice polar bear to cuddle up with. Eh, Alaska could be fun, Bea. I mean, it is still the last great frontier. You know that, right? Mm-hmm. Plus, it's only a two-year commitment. (laughing) Commitment was never your thing. Okay. Now, that's just not fair. Bea, you've gotta give me a chance here. Come on. I've been traveling the world for over 10 years trying to get you out of my head. -And you know what? -What? It ain't workin'. I didn't come here for this stupid Jeep. I came here for you. Come with me. (squealing, laughing) Next is-- whoa-- Ramona Quimby. My goodness. That's quite the tiara you have there. I designed it in the parking lot. -(chuckles) -So, tell me, why are you here today? 'Cause my dad says that commercials are the racket to be in. Hmm. Twirl. Twirl. -(screams) -(girl gasps) -(screams) -(laughing) Okay. Thank you, Ramona. (groans) -Don't move. -(gasps) A tiara made of burrs? It would have worked, Dad, until I fell into their stupid sandwich. (groans) -Sandwich? -Ow! -I won't even ask. -Ow! You're doing it too fast! 'Cause I'm late, Ramona. Very late. Sorry. (sighs) How's it look? Kinda trendy? (gasps) Oh. Yes, well, that's one way of putting it. -(gasps) -ROBERT: Listen up, ladies. I got a two-hour drive to get to this interview, so I need you to be responsible till your mom gets home. You have her number at the office if there's a problem, but remember, she's under a lot of stress, so no fighting, okay? Beezus, you're in charge. Baby monitor. How come she's always in charge? Um, have you seen your hair lately? -Imagine what you'd do to our house. -Hey! Just try to be good-- especially you. Bye! -(door closes) -(laughing) (chuckles) "Especially you." (exhales) (sizzling) (water boiling) Ramona, I don't think making dinner is gonna distract Mom from your hair. -It's worth a shot. -(rings) Quimby residence. Oh, hi, Henry. I'm not sure if Beezus is available. -Give it to me! Stop! Give it to me! -She could be in the bathroom. -Go away, you jerk! -HENRY: Wait. What did you say? -No, not you, Henry! -Ow! BEEZUS: You put him on speaker, doofus! -(kissing) I'm Beezus! I love Henry! -Shut up! -(both grunting) -(chuckles) Should I call back later? -No! I want you! -Huh? I mean, I wanna talk to you right now, so now is a good time! -Okay. -Get off! -(alarm beeping) -(gasps) (gasping) My hot dog soufflé! (gasps, squealing) Stop! (alarm stops) -(both screaming) -Ramona! -Ramona, move! -(screaming) Stop! Drop it! Drop it! -No! -I said, drop it! (whimpering) You will never change, will you? For a moment there, I actually thought that you were maturing, but you will always be a little pest! (Roberta crying) -I'll go get her. -No! Just stop! Stop touching everything! Everything that you touch you mess up, including my love life. You have a love life? Just feed the cat and leave me alone! -(thud) -(grunts) HENRY (on speaker): Uh, hello? Okay. I'm gonna hang up now. (dial tone) Picky Picky? It's dinnertime. -(food rattling) -Come on. Let's talk. Wake up. Wake up, lazy bum. (gasps) -(bowl clattering) -Beezus! -(knocks) -Beezus? I thought he was asleep, but he's not. What now? He's dead. (sobs) Picky Picky's dead. Don't worry. Mom will be home soon. She'll know what to do. No. Remember what Dad said? We can't make any trouble for Mom now. Okay. He was a Quimby before we were, Beezus. Picky Picky, I hope you have nine lives. And maybe tomorrow, you can wake up as somebody else's cat, start a new life. (sniffles) I really hope they feed you melon rind sometimes. I know you like that. I think it's important... that you know... Dad was just pretending to forget your name. (chuckles, sobs) He always knew it. He really did love you. We'll miss you, Picky Picky. (bell jingling) (sobs) (sniffles) It's okay. DOROTHY: You girls had to handle all this tonight by yourselves? I'm sorry. RAMONA: We're okay, Mom. How did I get so lucky to have two brave girls like you? Hmm? (kisses) (car alarm chirps) I'm home! (exhales) We have some news. So do I. I got the job. What? Great position. Start-up in eastern Oregon. How do you girls feel about that? Wait. To live there? Mm-hmm. But what about the house? We'll get a new one there. What's your news? Nothing. Ramona? Will you sleep in here with me tonight? I'm not ready for a new school... with all new kids. Me neither. But you'll do fine. You don't always embarrass yourself like I do. You're the most prettiest, perfect girl in high school, and everybody loves you. Ramona, those people don't know who I am, really. There's only one person in that whole school who really knows me. -Henry? -Yeah. And that took 15 years. Who else is gonna wanna waste 15 years getting to know me? I would. Ramona, I know that you think being different is bad, but it's not. You don't worry about coloring inside the lines, you know? Huh? You're your own person. You don't care what other people think. It's brave being how you are. Oh. Well... sometimes I color inside the lines. It really depends on the picture. Yeah. (laughing) MAN: All right. So, how does this look? MRS. KUSHNER: It's perfect. Yeah, it's great. Why does it have to be Susan's mom? She's supposed to be a very good agent, sweetheart. (man chattering) -That's great. Ta-da! -(laughing) (squeaking) Aren't you gonna help us, Ramona? We only have a few hours to do this. I don't wanna help sell the house. I wanted to save it. MRS. KEMP: Are you gonna fill these holes before you go? Howie wants to do it. Why don't you get your boyfriend Hobart to help? -He likes to dig. -Isn't that the truth? Now, he wants me to go with him to Alaska. Last night, he sent roses. Alaska? Did you say yes? I mean, I was tempted, but if I'm gonna uproot my entire life, I need some real sign of commitment. -I'm sorry, Bea. -Oh, no. Don't be. We had our fight, and now he's running away again. In the long run, I saved myself a massive heartache... and just replaced it with a... small one. Ramona, grab a hose and help out, okay? I know life stinks, but we still have to make the yard look good. Everything will be okay, babe. Onwards and upwards. (chuckles) -Oh! -(gasps) (laughing) Oh, I see! Very funny. Who did that? Bea? That's just adorable. Classy, Bea. Very classy. Now I gotta go inside and change all my clothes. Real nice. -Bea. -(gasps) Ah! That's for the roses, sweetheart. They need water. Oh! There it is!

I still wish that I could go back and fix all the stupid things I did when we were younger. I guess this is as close as I can get. You kept all this stuff? Yeah. That's my gum ball ring. Bea, I don't want to go anyplace else without you. I love you. Will you marry me? (crying) You will? -(clapping) -ROBERT: Whoo! -(grunts) Guts! -(giggles) My head is spinning! We must be crazy! We'll have to go to the courthouse and make it official. No, we ain't goin' to no stinking courthouse. If we're gonna do something crazy, we're gonna do it with style. We're gonna throw a real wedding. Honey, they want you in Alaska in three days. That's plenty of time. Sure. But what about a church or food or, say, a wedding dress? You can use mine. You always said you liked it. -We can just alter it. -Yeah! See? I like that idea. There you go! Hand-me-downs. It never ends, Ramona. Yeah. We get the word out, we book a band, boom-- we got a wedding! People can bring their own food. They can bring their own chairs. All we need is a little love and a few bridesmaids. Oh! I've always wanted to be a bridesmaid. Ah! Well, that was easy. Anybody else? -Ramona? Ramona? -What do you say? Will you do us the honor? Ramona? Sea bass! See what? Oh, it's an inside joke. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You said you wouldn't get reeled in. You said I would always have you around! Hey, Ramona? Get back here and apologize. -Honey, please come talk to me. -(door slams) (grunts) (chattering) MRS. KUSHNER: You have room for a piano. Also, look at this built-in desk. It's fabulous.

Thank you. Okay, Ramona, that's it. These antics of yours gotta stop right now. You're making our lives really difficult. I thought I made it colorful, Dad. Not in the middle of our open house. -Come on! -(phone ringing) You said you were gonna be more responsible. It's time to grow up. Dad, can't you see I'm trying? -Well, you gotta try harder. -BEEZUS: Dad? Mrs. Meacham's on the phone. -She needs to talk to you. -Oh, great. What now? Sweetie. (grunts) -Ramona, your father was just-- -Mom! I'm nine years old. I think I can tell when I'm not wanted. -I just have to run away. -(sighs) Ramona, don't be silly. -You're not gonna run away. -No, I mean it. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. How long will you be gone? I mean, just in case people start asking. Forever. Well, in that case, I think you're gonna need a bigger suitcase. Okay. Now, I've added your dad's old sweater. I don't want you to get cold at night. I know it's a little big on you now, but you'll eventually grow into it. Oh, and do you plan on brushing your teeth? That's my girl.

'Cause whatever I did wrong, I probably didn't mean it. Well, believe it or not, we weren't talking about you at all. Really? Yeah, she was talking about an opening... for an art teacher at your school, next term. Remember when she called the house the other day? Well, she told me that she passed that mural of ours on to the principal, who mentioned it to the superintendent. Long story short, it's crummy pay, it's part-time. I hear some of those kids down at your school can be a real handful. Oh! But I'm thinking I'm gonna take it. Oh, my gosh! That's better than a fireman! -(giggling) -I know.
