Please make my mother smarter. Why that face? Mother, what's worrying you? Nothing. I'm not worried at all. Please, dear Buddha, perhaps I ask too often, and you may be tired of this, but please help my mother. I'd better go to work now. The maintenance crew isn't reliable at all. So it takes more time to do an inspection! I'm going now. I've got eight runs this morning. Same in the afternoon. I'll be back in the evening. Look at that. What are the maintenance men doing? What a lousy job! This is an old car, though. Maybe I shouldn't blame them. Let's go. Trolley freak! Good morning, Mr. Tanba. Good morning. Are you still a religious man? Yes, I say my prayers every morning and evening. Well, it's hard on your mother. Don't worry. She's all right because I'm with her. You're right. How's the streetcar today? Not so good, not so bad. How is business? Just so-so. Now - Say hello to your mother. Don't get drunk again. Come straight home tonight. Shut up. You're the one driving me to drink. Hey. Let's go, Hatsu. Okay, buddy. I'll be right out. Listen. Come home drunk again and you sleep outside. What a woman! Why don't you say hello to my buddy? He was so drunk last night - Let's go, buddy. She'll keep going all day if we listen. All women are the same. They nag you so much you end up in a bad mood. After work, let's have a drink. - Good morning. - Have a nice day. Shima is a good man. But I can't stand that tic of his or that wife of his. Morning. Weigh this. We don't sell cabbage by weight. There's a set price per head. You expect me to pay for the bad part? What a greedy vendor! You can't accuse me of that. You know my greens are a lot cheaper than in town. Cheaper and worse. Your stuff doesn't even come close to the ones in town. All this about a head of cabbage. I don't have to listen to your chattering. Take it. You don't have to pay. What? I'm not a beggar! I asked the price. I'm a customer, aren't I? - But you treat me like - - I'm sorry. It just slipped out. Let me weigh it for you. Why count? No one cares how many hairs it has. You may be right, but for me, there must be just 30. Watching you work is a pain in the neck! Hey, who got you pregnant this time? There's my Umeko. I hear you're with a new young guy. You've gotten prettier. Hey, we haven't done it for a long time. Take a break from the young guys and let me have a little. Too good for us? Why not have a good time with me again? How are our children? Are they all well? This is a great disaster to us, Katsuko. Your aunt is in the hospital for an operation. God knows till when. I've arranged for your mother to pay the expenses. But even though it's her own sister, she wants us to pay it all back out of the monthly expenses we spend on you. Just think about that. You owe it to your aunt after everything she's done for you. You must work very hard. You know what worries her at the hospital. If you were more attractive and had a better figure, you could get a better job. But this is all you can do. To make up for it, do your aunt's share, too. Understand? Your nature isn't even human. Nor animal. I'd have to say your nature is purely vegetable. Hello! It's Isemasa. Drinking as usual? I shouldn't say this to a good customer, but he's really lazy. He drinks or sleeps while you and his wife work. Now that his wife is in the hospital, he makes you work all alone. You've gotten thinner, too. Here, take this. It's good. See you later. Hey, how are you? Why don't you answer me, asshole! He has the eyes of a dead man. He gives me the creeps. It's just as though he was dead. I'll bet his blood is as cold as ice. Our house ought to be built on a hill. We Japanese used to build houses in valleys and mountain coves. We've always preferred the lowlands. That's true. I saw pictures of foreign countries. They have their houses in high places, but ours are in low places. There's a reason for that. There are many earthquakes and typhoons in Japan. Wooden houses in high places are easily shaken by earthquakes and typhoons. So they chose the lowlands to avoid the danger. But that's not the only reason. The Japanese prefer soft light to bright sunshine. We like shady places. We like to live in the midst of nature. So we couldn't get used to concrete houses. That's right. I don't like concrete houses either. They're too cold for me. But we shouldn't forget one thing. It's true that wooden houses suit the Japanese people. But we mustn't cling to our culture and characteristics if we become weak and lose endurance as a result. By living in houses made of stone, iron, and concrete, foreigners have strengthened their characters and capabilities. Now we're building our own house. We must take our future into consideration. We must think of you, your children, and your grandchildren. Yes, that's true. He must have been handsome when he was young. He still is. Someone went over to see him one night. "Someone"? Trying to take a dig at me? What makes you think that? Well, did you go all the way? You always brag about getting what you want. Something must have happened. Once I'd made up my mind that I wanted him, I washed myself with a real perfumed soap at the public bath and went over to his place. How exciting. So did it go well or not? Well, when I was just about to enter his house, I heard an awful groan. I opened the door a little and looked in. He was asleep. He must have been having a nightmare. He groaned as if he was being crushed. Then he suddenly woke up... and said, "Ocho" in a low voice. It was like a voice from the grave. It gave me the chills. And I ran away from his place. This mackerel is no good. It's stale. But this one - A fresh fish has tight skin. Look at this. It's peeling off. Another one. That's all for tonight. Come on. Don't be so mean. - No, that's all. - Why? Buddy, it sure is good to see you. Come on in. I'm not so good. I want to talk to you. All right. Have a drink first. Come in. What happened? I can't stand my damn wife anymore. I feel like I'm some kind of dog, all tied up. I don't really understand, but that can't feel good, can it? Of course not. It's just like having a bucketful of sand poured over your head while you're eating. You know what? You sure do have your share of troubles at home. - Yeah, I do. - Tatsu's stubborn. She's good-natured, but she loses it when she gets mad. What's that? What did you say about the sand? Did she really pour sand over your head? No, it only felt like that. She was acting really grumpy, so I asked why. She said it wasn't any of my business. I told her, "Then don't be like that." Then she said, "Why shouldn't I?" How do I know why? I didn't know what to say, so I had to yell. I said, "Get out!" But she ignored me. So I got out myself and came here. After all, a husband has some pride. Doesn't he, Hatsu? You're so right. Husbands have to work hard enough outside. It's only natural they want their wives to be nice to them. But my wife isn't like that. She's like a nail digging into a cavity in my tooth. - That's too bad. - Yeah. - Women are really impossible. - Yeah. They have too much free time. They enjoy turning a little thing into something huge. That's right. - I'll tell her a thing or two. - You will? Now, now. You're drunk. Don't be ridiculous. This much won't get me drunk, right, buddy? - But you'd better not go now. - He's right. - I will go. - No. Don't go. You'd better not. Don't go, okay? I'm fine. Just shut up and listen. Leave it to me. - Okay, then. - Are you all right? I'm all right. I'm going. - Are you sure? - Yeah, bye now. He's gone. I'll have some. Pour me some. You want some sake? My hands must be drunk, too. You're spilling it all over. I'm sorry. Hey. You're Hatsu's Yoshie, aren't you? This is a big surprise. I feel sort of funny. Strange. My heart isn't beating at all. Let me see. It's thumping all right. It's moving my hand. Oh, is it? How is your heart? - Feel for yourself. - May I? It takes too long this way. The hell with your heart. Hold on a minute. Not so rough. Wait. Am I rough? What's the matter? Don't go to sleep there. You'll catch cold. No, I won't. Hello, boy. You can have that there. Thank you. Cook the fish before you eat it, though. Don't come in while customers are here. You again! There's nothing for you here. No use standing there. Get out. Wait. Don't be so mean! Thank you. I've been thinking all evening about the house we're building. Looks like you're sleepy. No, I'm not sleepy. I'm listening. The gate comes first. The gate is the face of a house. The face shows the character. That's right. Since we're building a house on a hill, it must be in a European style. How about rococo? Or Spanish style? British style isn't bad either. They're a bit showy. It should be neither too fancy nor too imposing. I want a gate both plain and inviting. What do you think? It's made of iron, yet it doesn't seem cold. It's not so showy, rather inviting. Yes, it's nice. It will be a deep green. But it must be painted red first, anti-corrosive. The gate is finished. No, not that. Those are my tools. The money is over here. There's not much, but I'll give you some. That's all I have now. Come again if you need more. I'll save some up for you. Close the shutters. Come in through the door next time. Look at this. This is real roast beef. Cooked rare very nicely. The inside must remain red like this. You want it? No, you eat it. I don't like raw meat. Now that the gate is made, the fence comes next. Yes, that's right. Since the gate is made of iron, the fence will be made of iron bars, too. Nice, isn't it? Yes, it's nice. Very nice. Katsuko! You look like you're about to collapse. You can only work so much. You've got a right to think of yourself. I know you work day and night. But you shouldn't have to for that drunkard. Think of your health and don't overwork yourself. You've gotten thinner. Here, take this. I took a bite, though. That darn drunkard. He can go to hell! Be careful! You nearly got run over. What if you got killed? You're not allowed to sit on the tracks. And you were sitting right there. Unbelievable! Hillbilly! TROLLEY FREAK It's me. Prices have gone up. It's a problem. You won't even believe how much salted salmon cost. I know. It's really horrible. I wanted to buy a slice of pork. Just one slice. And the price really shocked me. Those two and their husbands - I can't believe it! They've swapped husbands! Of course everyone has her secret affair. No one's putting that down. But they're too open about it. They still get along with each other. Their husbands too. Hope this good weather will last. Yeah, I hope so. See you, buddy. - See you tomorrow. Hey. Now, we're going to finish our house. That's right. Exactly. The color of the walls, excluding the doors and the windows, will decide the feeling of the house. What color would you like? Let's see, I'd like... white. White? I did it white as you said, but it's too common. Wonderful! Yes, it's nice. I'm going to kill you! Come and get me, bastards! What's wrong with your husband? Who knows? He gets drunk like that sometimes. What, you old fart? He's all right. It's all right. What did Mr. Tanba tell you that time? Well... Shall I change places with you? What, you old fart? Let me trade places with you. It's tiring to do that alone. I really felt deflated. Trade places with him? It's not like it was manual labor. How could I ask him? I felt ashamed and went to bed. It's a slight change of design. It's not a great change. But you put in so much work already. I mean that porch. It's too small for any practical use. You'll want to play on it or look around from it. Yes, you're right. We should redo it. That's a much better shape, isn't it? Yes, it is. Don't give me that look. I must eat this much for the baby. What's the matter, Father? Why do you look at us so strangely sometimes? Oh, I'm only surprised at how big you've grown. I'm fed up with everything now. Life is nothing but pain to me. When I get up in the morning and get ready for breakfast... thinking I have to do everything all over again, I just lose my strength. Food doesn't taste good. I lose my appetite. When I go to the public bath... I'm disgusted to see myself in the mirror. Naked, I look really disgusting and filthy. I can't stand myself. At this point, the only thing I want... is to die quickly. I want to disappear from this world. This powder is used in engraving. It's a very strong poison not sold to the public. You'll die without pain an hour after taking it. If you really want to die, take it. Thank you. It's very kind of you. Good-bye. I wasn't always like this. I used to run a kimono shop. I had a wife and two sons. I had five employees and a servant. I even had two mistresses and lived in luxury. But... after my sons were called up for military service and were killed at the China Front... I lost interest in business. My wife fell sick and died six months later. My house was burnt during an air raid, and I lost everything. I had to let my mistresses go. I earned my living by peddling toys. Still, my dead wife and sons appear in my dreams and talk with me every night. They laugh and talk as if they were alive. You must be happy during those times. Yes, I am. You feel that happiness because you live your life. In other words, they are alive as long as you are alive. Is it all right to kill them by killing yourself? You said this poison would take effect in an hour. Can't I stop it now? It's only been five minutes. The effect of one drug can be mitigated by another. In medicine, there are laxatives and astringents, digestives and counteractives, things like that. Is there such a medication for this poison? Of course there is. Every poison has an antidote. I'm not sure if I have any. - Look for it. - Just a minute. Hurry up and give me that antidote. Where is it? Where? Not there? Where is it? Hurry! Give me the antidote now! Murderer! Give me the medicine. Murderer! Don't be so upset. It's only a digestive you took. This is nothing to get upset about. Just keep still. Close your eyes. Lie still with your eyes closed. It's nothing. Close your eyes! Do it! Why are you making a fire? We don't need hot water. I have to boil this fish. Fish? Let me see. Sour mackerel. It's not raw. It's pickled in salt and vinegar. But the sushi chef told me to cook it first. It must be a mistake. We don't boil sour mackerel. But - Now let's consider the kitchen. The modern style is convenient. But to make the best food, our traditional style is preferable. What do you think? You mentioned Hei's woman. Isn't she the one called Ocho? I don't know. She just invited herself in? - She doesn't look that pushy. - Don't be fooled by her looks. I once knew a woman who looked just like her. Women like that are extraordinarily sensual. They don't lose interest in sex no matter how old they are. Wait and see. She'll eat him alive. Supper is ready, please. Old man, there's something common to all women, 15, 30, no matter how old they are. A middle-aged woman sometimes looks as innocent as a teenage girl. A 16-year-old girl sometimes gives you a look as if she were a 35-year-old woman. Women are really devilish. Stop crying, Taro. Umeko is worried about you. Father. What is it? Is it true we aren't your children? Think for yourself. Do you think you aren't? I know every one of you is mine. So, you're all dear to me. But if you don't love me and if you don't think I'm your dad, then I am not, right? But people have always said that we aren't your kids, that our fathers are all different. And they didn't just tell me, but also Jiro, Hanako and Shiro. People say what they want. You can't stop them from saying all kinds of things. Right? No one can really tell whose child is whose. If you believe someone is your dad, then you are his son. If someone says you aren't my kids, then you ask him about his own father. I'll bet he can't answer. After all, it's either you believe me, or you believe the others. Who do you believe? - You, Father. I like my sister. The mackerel isn't the reason. If the fish was spoiled, we'd have hives or feel nauseated. But neither of us have those symptoms. That is to say, this isn't food poisoning. It's only diarrhea caused by exposure to the cold. Yes, that's right. I'll be back. The operation turned out all right. I've had a good long rest for four months, and I'm told to rest even more. I don't think I've been this happy since I was born. But one thing worried me after I came home. It's Katsuko. She's become so thin and sick-looking. She earned our living all alone. That's why. There must be something more. It's time, Katsuko. You need to prepare your aunt's dinner on time. Make it according to the doctor's recipe. This house? Excuse me. I'm a police investigator. Do you know him? No, I don't. It was at night, so you may not recognize him. But you must remember that you were robbed. No, I don't remember that. Strange. This fellow was arrested a week ago for burglary. He confessed to having robbed you too. That's not what I said. It's true that I snuck in here and tried to steal that box. But he told me it was only his tools and gave me some money. I don't know anything about that. I admit it myself, so it's true. You told me to come for money again. No, I didn't. You must have dreamed it. Maybe he's senile. Can someone who's senile do work like this? Didn't he break in or steal anything at night? No, nothing like that happened. What a waste of time. Excuse us. - We have guests. - Hello. Come in. Come in. You don't have to hesitate here. Come in. Excuse me. Come and greet my colleagues. I can't get it to start. This is frustrating. I have to do all this for a bunch of bastards crowding the place. Did you see the chief today? He took out a cigarette and struck a match. Then the explosion! The whole box, right by his nose. Meet Mr. Igawa, Mr. Nomoto, and Mr. Matsui. This is my wife. Nice to meet you. I'm going to the bath. The fire's lit. I'll warm some sake. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever found a way to get rice from a rice store? I don't mean borrowing, I mean taking it right in front of their eyes. You take a big pot and get it all wet on the inside, and have it filled at the rice store. Try to get it on credit and they'll refuse. You throw the rice out, but the pot is wet. So some rice remains stuck to the sides. If you repeat that three times, you'll get enough for a meal. Great, isn't it? The sake is ready. - I'll get it. Mr. Igawa, please. Mr. Nomoto. We'll start with Mr. Igawa, our superior. What is it? Say, Shima. We're not welcome here, are we? Did I say something wrong? No. You're a good person. I know that. But what's wrong with her? You introduced her as your wife, so we greeted her politely. But she - - I'm sorry. I apologize. It's just that she's rough and selfish. Don't apologize. I'm not blaming you. You're a good person. That's why I'm outraged by her. Who is she? How can she call herself a wife? I'm not mad about how rude she was to us. But what a way to treat her husband! She doesn't greet you when you come home. And she leaves you alone with your guests. I can't take it! That's not how a wife should behave! If I were you, I would kick her out! That's why... I'm apologizing to you. You don't have to. You're really a good person. I'm not blaming you. You should kick her out instead of apologizing to us. As fellow men, let me say this. That kind of woman - How dare you say that. What has my wife done to you? How can you tell me to kick her out? - Let's not fight, Shima. - It's fine. Let's listen to him. She's my wife. Sure, my wife - She might seem worthless to you. But she's been through a lot because of me. Even when we had nothing to eat but water, she's stuck right by me. You don't know how she fought to make a living with me. That rice-pot story - She did that. What right do you have to tell me to kick her out? Tell me. What right do you have? I understand. I was wrong. Forgive me. Let's have a drink. Shima. You won't talk to me. I understand. I can't say anything about you blaming me. Not after you saw what I did. What was the matter with me? I don't understand myself. Something like a wild beast was in me. I couldn't control myself. It wasn't like I loved him more than you. Believe me. I know you suffered a lot. But I've had a hard time of it too. My mother felt sorry for you. She didn't forgive me as long as she lived. Since her death, I've hated and blamed myself. I hear that even a criminal who's committed murder is pardoned after serving his time. If there's something that would satisfy you, please tell me. I'll do anything to make it up to you. GYNECOLOGIST I don't care how it happened. Just be honest and tell me who it is. I have to know so I can decide what to do. Tell me, Katsuko. Who is the man? What's wrong with him? He's been going to the bathroom a lot. He must be very ill if he can't walk anymore. I feel sorry for him, but I wouldn't talk to his stuck-up father. If the diarrhea doesn't stop, he'd better see a doctor. It's not so serious. Right? Right. I'll be fine soon. You tried to be nice, but he's too proud. No, he isn't proud. Poor fellow. He's just weak. I feel more sorry for the boy, though. It doesn't matter who did it. Let me make one thing clear. You seem to suspect me, but I didn't do it. How could I? She's like a family member, not just a niece. She's my adopted daughter, you know. So which is it? Does she keep or get rid of the baby? She shouldn't keep the baby. She's too young. What about our reputation? She should take medical measures rather than ethical measures now. What do you mean? Abortion? That's right. And the money? We'll have to borrow from your sister. But we've already borrowed so much from her. Yes, we'll have to make it so that she can't refuse us. Excuse me. Is this Katsuko Watanaka's residence? Will you come with me? - What is it? - An assault. It may become a murder case. I see. Go with the officer. Are you her father? Katsuko is my wife's niece. You said an assault. How badly is she injured? She's not the victim, but the assailant. She took a kitchen knife and stabbed this kid, Okabe - A sake-shop delivery boy. He's badly wounded. Hurry up. You don't have to go see her right away. Pay a visit to the victim first. You can't see him. He's in a coma. Come to the station. Remember, you're the parents of the assailant. A fast cure is the only treatment in such a case. But there's a limit to it. I wish I could walk. I'm sure I'll be able to walk soon. I don't mean that. I'm not asking you to go get food. If I can't stand the hunger, I'll go myself. Don't worry. I'm not so hungry. The longer you fast, the better you get. One can live without eating for a week or so. Well... We were talking about the drawing room. I proposed the Scottish style. But I've decided to reconsider. Well? What's the situation? How's Katsuko? Did she really attack the delivery boy? With a kitchen knife? She really did. I've been thinking. There can be only one reason why she did it. You agree, don't you? One reason. He got her pregnant. She won't say anything. No matter how many times I asked, she wouldn't tell me why she did it. If she had any reason for doing it, it would be considered. The officer told me so. But she just keeps quiet. No wonder she can't talk. She's ashamed. That's why. The police want you to come. What for? She's your niece. She's your adopted daughter. I'll have to go there every day now. What will I say every time they ask where you are? Tell them I'm sick. I've got nothing to do with this. They've got no right to summon anybody for anything. How dare they! You won't forgive me. You'll never forgive me. What kind of tree is this? It's no longer a tree when it's dead. Luckily it's over. The delivery boy will recover in three weeks. He said this, protecting Katsuko, "I don't understand why she did it. But I don't hate her. If the victim doesn't think she did anything wrong, then why punish Katsuko?" A policeman told me so. He says that because of a guilty conscience. If he was stabbed for no reason, why should he ask them not to punish her? He's as much as confessed to the crime. The police want you for that. They know you aren't sick. They'll come for you. Come for me? Why would they want me? Katsuko wants to talk to you in front of them. What for? I don't know. When she learned that the boy was safe, she asked them to call you. I think they already know something. Nonsense! Whatever that wicked girl said isn't true! Why are you shouting? If what she says isn't true, you don't have to shout or be afraid of the police. I'm not afraid of the police! What proof can they find in her lies? Hey. I don't see your friend. Where is he? We didn't work together today. He'll be here soon. Give me a shot of the devil killer. It packs a punch when you're tired out. The new one I got is pretty strong. I've been drinking for years. The real poison is - Say no more. After all, man can't live without food. Even a sick man should eat something. I'll go get some food. I'll be back soon. I'll get something good for you. Quiet! Who's there? Just a minute now. Let me see. I drank a shot at that stall over there then went down a side street into another bar. Who's there? How can you say that, idiot? Have you forgotten your husband's voice? What kind of a wife are you? It's you. What's the matter? A fine greeting. "It's you." Don't joke around. You had the devil killer, didn't you? So what? What's wrong with that? Give me some water. - Don't ask too much. Why don't you mind your husband for once? Water! - Here. This is my buddy, isn't it? It's my buddy! Weren't you with him? No, not today. I had a lot of free whiskey after work. Give me a hand. He's too heavy. - Hey. - What? - Up. - What are you doing? What are you doing to me? Let me go! Come on, buddy. My husband's dead drunk. And you too, Hatsu? What did you say? You call him your husband? What do you mean? Look at him. Give me a pillow. He's my buddy, isn't he? It's my buddy! You still have your shoes on. You too, and you carried him up. What? Me too? Yeah, I still have my shoes on too. Well, my best wishes to him. Good night. Say hello to Yoshie. Water! Give me some water! Here's your water! I'm back. I told them you were sick. The restaurant man gave us something good. We forgot about the swimming pool. Let's make one. Oh, yes, let's. One you'd like. I'm glad you're talking. Everything will be all right. The worst is finally over. Children are really very strong. A swimming pool is good. It'll be in the lawn. White tiles in the midst of evergreens. Still, filling and draining it will be hard. The place is on a hill. We'll need a huge water tank in case of water shortages. And the drainage problem. To drain a pool full of water, a small drainpipe won't do. But don't worry. We'll make it. This is all your idea, and the pool will be good for your health. Your soup is ready. It's consommé. It's best after not eating. What's wrong? How was your man last night? Mine was dead drunk again. I don't know what to say! Men are all the same. I wish they brought home half the money they spend on liquor. What makes them do it? Something just gets into them. I'm tired of this. Hey! - They've swapped again. - Looks like rain. - They look happy though. - Look at that cloud. Yeah, it's about time. Go ahead. I don't see you at the store anymore. Oh, right. Your uncle's disappeared. I'm sorry. I don't understand. Why did you do that to me? Why? I wanted... to kill myself. You mean suicide? But, why did you have to do that to me then? I don't know how to say this right. I don't exactly remember... what it was like. Only, when I thought of killing myself, I was afraid you would forget me. I thought you would forget me soon after I died. I was so scared. So scared. I couldn't stand it. I had no idea. Let's go eat something. I'm not hungry now. Well, then, some other time. I'm sorry, Mr. Okabe. Look, your pool is all done. Working hard, eh? Hello! The maintenance crew had better finish the job by morning. This car may be old, but that doesn't mean they can slack off. I must give them a talk tomorrow. Wait and see. THE END
