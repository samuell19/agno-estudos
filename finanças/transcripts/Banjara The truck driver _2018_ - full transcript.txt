Stay there. Let me check first. It's all clear. Come on. You are safe here. This apartment has just one key, which is with me. Don't open the door for anyone. I repeat, you don't need to leave this place. I'll be back tomorrow. Don't open the door for anyone. You don't need to worry. He who'll try to mess with Simmi needs to worry. Because Simmi hits where it hurts. You know, the people involved in this murder.. ..are very powerful and strong people. No doubt, only a Punjabi girl can have the courage.. ..to testify against them. No phone calls, correct? I'll have to answer. It's my boyfriend. No means no. Turn it off. - It's yours. - Oh, f**k. Okay, wait. Till the time you don't testify, you won't tell anyone where you are. - Got it? - Yes. I am done. Now it's your turn. Hi Dara, I'm good. How are you? I cannot talk to you for long. I'll be in Calgary tomorrow, meet me there. Okay? I'll call you later. I love you too, sweetheart. Goodbye now. Okay? - Hey, Maddy.. - What did you think? Rascal! You don't know. Simmi hits where it hurts. Come, Baba. Coming. Shall we? Look at her sing. He asks too many questions. What happened? This isn't aroma of food, it's a flower's fragrance. Buddy, your guess is sometimes right. An angel in hiding? You! Who hits brakes like this? Who made you a driver? I did. But who asked you to get in. It's your perfume that caused him to hit the brakes. She is neither an Indian nor a foreigner. She lies and then complains. Forget me and continue driving. Okay. I'll drive after you get down. - What? - Didn't you hear him? Baba asked you to get down. Get out. - Get down. - What's wrong? - Get out. - But.. Come on. - Listen! - Get out. - Get down. Come on. - Wait.. - Wait! Hold on. - Come on. I don't want to send you away, but go. Go away. Go, go. - Let's go. - One second, one second. - Stop! Please. - Hey fragrant witch, move aside. One second, please. A bus's passenger can't ride in a truck. I need help. Are you going to Calgary? We might go to Pucho? How does it concern you? But this road goes to Calgary. It doesn't go to Pucho. The road doesn't go anywhere actually. It's the vehicle which moves. And it's moving after dropping you off. - Move aside. - Please listen to me. We won't help you. And we won't listen to your good or bad story. Baba, my boss, he is going to do something very good. And I too am going to do something very good. Please listen to me. Look, if boss likes your story then we might help you. But Baba's decision will be the final decision. Okay. See, the thing is that I am from Vancouver. Born and brought up in Canada. I'll explain it in short. I am an independent girl. And I have just one boyfriend. He stays in Calgary. My parents don't like him. And they want me to marry someone else. That doesn't even happen in Khair Balongi Dao anymore. You still living in the 14th century in Canada? Do they still serve Pathiwale Chole Bhature in Khair Balongi Dao? They serve it here in Montreal. Do they still play Lucky Ram Lucky and Chandi's song? They play it in Calgary. Do you find anyone calling BMW as BM-Double U there? You can find them here. All the things that doesn't happen in Punjab happens here. Tell me, if it isn't so. Oh really? Fine. Do one thing. Sing Didar Sandhu's duet songs with your boyfriend. And get lost. Let us leave. Aren't you a Punjabi? Being a Punjabi, you won't help a helpless Punjabi girl? The thing is, we can help the Punjabi kudi.. ..but we cannot help a Punjabi girl. Got it? Billa? Let her get in. Okay, he listened to me. Come in. Come. Get in. - What are you waiting for? - Really? Get in. Come this way. - Get in. - Thank you. Come. Get it, dear. Come. I haven't eaten anything since morning. I am so hungry. Oh, I found something. Don't you have anything else? There's something in the trailer. No! I'm pretty full. Thank you so much. You guys are very sweet. To hell with sweet. You ate food meant for two of us. Look at her capacity. You used to taunt me that this pint can carry a gallon. Look at her, this eye drop sized girl can carry a gallon. By the way, you could have refused to help me after listening to my story. But then you changed your mind. - Why? - Because of Mr. Neek Singh. Something similar had happened with him. Who is Mr. Neek Singh? Neek Singh used to live in the neighborhood of Gujranwala Kangniwal, Punjab. This was when Punjab wasn't divided as Pakistani or Hindustani. Punjab used to be just Punjab. Here you go, aunt. A shawl for you. May Allah keep you happy, son. Why did you have to get me a shawl? You anyway spend all that you earn in a trip on the villagers. You should save some for yourself. I have nothing of my own. This village is mine. - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! We won't leave anyone of theirs alive here. Uncle, everyone knows yet you stay unaware. They have been killing our people over here. How can we do nothing about this? But they are all our people here. There are no strangers here. There is one from another religion here. How can he be one of us? Harneek, my boy! Harneek! What is it, aunt? Harneek, this is the wrath of Lord. Bad times are here. What happened? What is wrong? People have become enemy of their own people. It's time to use your judgment and not give in to rumors. Uncle, don't misunderstand news as rumors and befriend the enemies. It is time to think about only one thing. They are killing our people. So we too will kill their people. Government has caused this division. This chaos won't last for long. Everything will settle down on its own. Nothing is going to be right again, son. For Almighty's sake, please leave this place. Leave? Where do I go? Blood for blood. Go to your people. - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! This is my house, my village. This is no longer your house. These villagers are no longer your friends. - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! My childhood has changed. Which I spent on the shoulders of Hamir and Khans alike? I have helped Rashid and Rafaq raise their children. I should leave them? Baba's hands have changed.. ..which helped me grow up? - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! Shout out aloud! Everything has changed. The news on the radio changed everything. Those times and days have become a thing of a past now. Consider this as God's will and leave. - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Goodbye, aunt. May God be with you. - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! - Shout out aloud! - Lord is greatest! Shout out aloud! You old woman, happy with what you have done? You helped him flee? - Who is it? Who is it? - He's a Sikh. - Come on. Let's go. - He's a Sikh. He's a Sikh. Go after him! Catch him. Come on. Hurry up. Don't you dare! Don't you dare take another step! I swear on Lord.. ..as long as I am alive.. ..I'll the one who even looks at my daughter. Aunt, I swear upon my turban, I am a Sikh. Sikhs were born to help the helpless. Those who kill in the name of religion won't even get a place in hell. Sikhs are killing in the name of Waheguru.. ..whereas Muslims in the name of Allah. Oh God! Protect my daughter. Mother? Mother.. Mother! Mother! If you want, I can drop you anywhere. Where do you want to go? I have no one left. There has to be someone who will support you in these troubled times. There is a village close to Amritsar, Pershera. My parents got me betrothed there. Come on, I'll take you there. Are you hungry? Would you like to eat a Pinni? 'Mother asked me not to eat anything offered by a stranger.' Where have we reached? We are crossing a mosque. We are in East Punjab now. We had crossed a Gurudwara. It is now a part of west Punjab. Punjab got divided into two. Even the rivers will get divided I guess. Each will get around two. Are you hungry? Yes. Don't throw them again. Aunt Noora had made them with a lot of affection. Oh no, you are choking. I'll stop near a well. We can take a breather there. I think sun is very strong here. This well has dried up. Stay in the truck. Keep the windows closed and doors locked. I'll go find another source. Where did she go? Where did you go? Stupid girl? I asked you to stay in the truck. Do you have a death wish? Let's go. "The winds get merrier." "They worship the path you take." "The winds get merrier." "They worship the path you take."

"Journey ends quickly if your company is good." Stay awake! Stay awake! Where are we sitting? We are in our village. Where else? I know we are in our village. I mean where does this fall now. We are India, right uncle? Chief, who owns a truck here? He looks suspicious. - Who knows where they have come from? - Stay there. - Let's go and find out. - There is a woman with him. Stay awake! - Stay awake! - What is your name, brother? My name is Harneek Singh. I am from Kangniwal. What is this woman? What is her name? Where does Ratan Singh live, brother? We asked you what her name is. Her name is stupid. Where does Ratan Singh live? Brother, I think he kidnapped her from there. My name is Soni. Okay we accept that your name is Soni. But how would we know whether you are from this side or that side. She was betrothed into Ratan Singh's family. I need to drop her there safe and sound. Show me his house. - Let's go. - Let's go, chief. We will soon know the truth. - Let's go. - Stay awake! Who is it? I am coming. Who is it? Brother, someone from the other side has come to meet you. He was asking where you stay. Yes? Who is it? Tell me. We have been asking the same questions. Calm down. Calm down. Yes, that reminds me the fire will cool down. - Look after them. - Let's go. Look after them. - Who are they? - I don't know. Soni? Yes, it's Soni. Oh God! What happened? They killed everyone, those misguided souls. Mother was alone. She made me leave the village with her. But she couldn't escape them for long. I met them by chance. She knew where you stayed. It was a blessing from God. Take care of her, I'll get going. Goodbye. Wait, young man. Who are you? I am Harneek Singh. I am from Kangniwal. This partition left me homeless. I found her alive among the dead bodies lying on the road. Her mother died a painful death. I had promised her that I'll take her to a safe place. I have fulfill my promised. I am leaving her in your care. How would we know whether you have sinned or kept her honor intact? Ungrateful beings. You should be praise this girl.. ..to keep her honor intact even in troubled times. And she kept praying for her husband's wellbeing even when in trouble. Well done, young man. You did a good deed by bringing her here. Okay then, goodbye. Goodbye. Get her inside. Come in, my dear. Come, my brave child. Let's go. Look girl, there is no other way to say this. We have been hearing new stories every day.. ..about what are doing to the girls across the border. And a stranger brought you here. Look at your state, how do we believe that he didn't do anything. For God's sake don't say that, mother. Only God can vouch for my intentions. You had chosen me to be your son's bride. Look into my eyes and you shall know the truth. Look into her eyes! I don't see anything but filth in them. Look girl, we don't care about what lies in your eyes. Have some shame, Ratan Singh. For God's sake, think about others at least. I can see it in her eyes that she is telling the truth. I don't know understand what shamelessness blinds all of you. I can see everything, it's you who can't see anything. He can see the truth. Soni, my child. This is bad. But you should stay strong. I will talk to Panth. Aunt, I don't think anything will work out. Why do you worry? Your Panth is different from all of them. There, Panth is back. I'll talk to him. Aunt, there is nothing to think about. I cannot marry a girl who has spent a night with a truck driver. Panth, he isn't that kind of a man. If he were like that then why would he bring her here? A woman can read into a man's eye. Aunt, you can never look at someone and know how he is. There is just one thing I know. Come hell or high water, I don't want her. Where are you going, stupid? How does it concern you? Didn't I leave you with your fiance's family? Yes, but they are idiots. Great. But can't they be given any sense? Suspicion doesn't let that happen. It's very simple. I cannot marry someone who doubts me. Did you run away from there? What do you intend to do now? Travel. With? With the one who gave me a new life. Will this do? Yes, it will do. If not this then that will do. Wow! What a beautiful love story. I want a treat. Full tummy buffalo. What rubbish. Did he call me buffalo? I asked for a treat. Your grandfather found such a beautiful wife. I deserve a treat. Right? Well the thing is I can only offer you my blood and skin. Bite me, and enjoy. I don't want your blood. I want coke. Take a right turn. - Let's stop at a gas station. Let's party. - I like you. Both is stupid. Don't mind him. He gets angry sometimes. He is very hungry. He became a good driver. I've got a point. Can I give you an advice? Hello? An advice. Did you just curse me? Mental case. Can I give you an advice? Evil speaks, evil does. What does that mean? Dead man speaks, tear the shirt. Very bad joke. Anyway, I was wondering as it is a celebration of a Punjabi wedding. That too your grandfather and grandmother's. It was such a beautiful love story. So we should have a grand celebration. Champagne? Okay, not in your budget. - No problem. - That.. Wine? What do you think Billa? Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes, yes. Billing, please. What is this, a Punjabi dress, for me? Wait a second. I just took a lift from you, to go be with my boyfriend. I hope you aren't thinking too much into it. Change your name from Simmi to Delusional. - What? - Doubt. Idiot. Dumbo. Come on, quickly get her into the car. I said keep quiet. Come on, brother. Hurry up. Billa! - Billa! - Yes? Who the f**k is he? Stop him. We are not engaged to you, man. This is between us. Leave. You are still carrying an old pistol? This was used back in the second world war. 45's bullets are thick, they get stuck in the barrel sometimes. This won't work. The bullet will get stuck in it. It's barrel is rusted and defective. Oh, f**k. I am not a fool. Don't try to be smart. Let's go. Oh, my God! That was so scary. I thought I was going to die today. But somewhere in my heart I knew.. ..that Neek Singh's grandson, will be a gentleman. - What happened now? - Get down. You want me to get down? What happened now? What happened? Baba is angry, he is furious. - But.. - Get down. She doesn't move. Come on. Come on. Go. - Move it. Go away. Go. Go. - Wait, wait, wait. Look, listen to me, listen to me. Hello! - What did I do wrong now? - You are a fraud. Your got trapped in your own screenplay. You were going to meet your boyfriend. You also said you want to get married. These people who had come to kill you, were they your father? Were they there to bless you? It's nothing. They were criminals. Killers. I couldn't help it. I was running for my life. I couldn't trust anyone. I had no one I could trust and tell the truth. I was scared. What if you too would have refused? Then what would I do? Walk to Calgary or die? Tell me? Listen to me just once. Seriously. This time, I'm going to tell you the truth. Just one last time. Tell me. Simmi! Lock the storeroom. - Okay. - Okay? J&amp;B! Sorry sir, bar is closed. We didn't ask about that, chick. We ordered some drinks. Sorry sir, can't do that now. The bar is closed. Please leave. You're refusing us? In our country? Our city? Come on, make us some drinks.. ..or else I'll show you what happens when you say no. Sorry ma'am, we are closed. Jaz, it's okay. Let me talk to them. Look guys, she said no. And that means no. Now get out of here or I'll call the police. We're scared, aren't we? Can you see how scared we are? Let me teach you a lesson, you little b*it*h. B*it*h? Not a b*t*h, you are messing with a lioness. White boy. What did you say? Now how do I explain it in English. That Simmi hits where it hurts. - Get out! Get out right now! Get out! - I am not leaving. Seriously, it's not that big of a deal. Get out! No! No! No, get out! I'm not leaving, okay? - You gotta get out right now. - I am not a b*t*h, I am a lioness. I know my rights, okay? I won't spare you. Leave me alone. - What're you doing? - Hey, you can't touch me. - No, you can't hit me. - Dare you! What're you doing? What did you do? - Come on, run! - Jaz! - We gotta go! - Jaz! - What did you do bro! Let's get out of here. - Right now! Run! Are you okay? I am so sorry. We need help. Help! So you want me to believe in your lie like before? This time it is not a lie. Look at me. Trust me only if you think that I'm telling the truth. Really? Can I believe you? Who are you? Simmi here. Where are you? I won't be telling you that. No way! What do you mean by that? Yeah, I mean it. You said I am safe. I have already been attacked twice. You know what? You were supposed to protect me. And I am not safe. Listen, I told you so many times.. ..those people are very dangerous. That's why I am worried about you. After it is my duty to protect you. Then why didn't you perform your duty well. I am very sorry. It won't happen again. Tell me, where are you now? I said no, means no. Now I'll manage to get to Calgary on my own. Thank you so much! You deserve a hug. Oh, not you. Thank you. You were very kind. I know, Mr. Neek Singh. But your principles don't work in this generation. - No. - He is right, grandpa. Your son is right. How does it concern us? Whether she is from Punjab or Bengal. Whether she is alone or with an army. Whether her story is true or fake. She might be telling the truth. How does it concern us whether someone shoots her or slit her throat. With hands or a knife? If you want to kill her then just kill her. You drive on. Go on. So we are going back now? Hey, helpless girl. Get in. Get in. Get in. You shouldn't be stubborn. You won't find such emotional people like us in Canada.. ..even if you go looking with a torch in hand. If there were others like us you would've reached a lift by now. Don't act smart. You will die. You will freeze. Get in. Tell your boss to first come here and apologize. Hello, madam. He won't apologize. Right? Right? Billa, I don't have time to waste. I'll count only till three. Hello, we will count only till three. Get in. One. Two. Three! - She's coming! - Wait! Your boss is very unromantic. He doesn't care about me. Thank you, Mr. Neek Singh. I am sure he returned only because of you. Don't yawn, or I will feel lazy too. Okay listen, now I am very sleepy. I think I'm going to sleep. Please play some soothing instrumental music. I'll play Bismillah Khan's Shehnai. Go to sleep. For God's sake, go to sleep. And keep sleeping. Hey, hello? Do you want to leave or stay? This isn't a pillow, it's a gift. Oh really? Did you come back because of that Punjabi dress? Don't assume anything. I just took a lift from you. Did you take a lift or gave one? Oh I see. And who is this dress for then? It's for Kiran. Kiran? Who is this? K.. Kiran? The love of Binder's life. I am neither longer sleepy nor hungry. Let's listen to Binder and Kiran's love story. Sometimes like Sohni, Sahiba, Heer.. Sometimes like a poet's muse.. Sometimes like a sketch made by a lover.. "Sometimes like Sohni, Sahiba, Heer.." "- Sometimes like a poet's muse.. - Wonderful!" "Sometimes like a sketch made by a lover.." Oh God, did it have to breakdown now? Couldn't you break down elsewhere? I can't see anyone here who would help me. Brother will be upset because I'll get late. Oh God, why did this driver get down? What's wrong, girl? Nothing. Nothing? I am talking about this scooter and not about you. Nothing. Then you are pushing it for fun? It has broken down. But how does it concern you? Is this how you talk to people who come to help you? If a bad person asks then it is a bad thing. Do I look like a bad person? Truck drivers aren't good people. Truck drivers drink alcohol. They trouble girls. They keep twisting their moustaches. How do you know that? Do you work as a clerk at the PNA? My friend had told me about truck drivers. Okay. Okay. Is your friend having an affair with a driver? Disgusting! What are you saying? Your scooter has broken down. You don't want to seek driver's help. This is such an isolated road. What if something goes wrong? Call home, I'll wait till someone shows up. My phone's battery has conked. Right. You spend the whole day on snapchat. The battery is bound to get drained. Why don't you install a truck's battery in your phone. Use my phone to call. I'll wait. From your phone? Why? Do you have a problem? What will I say when my family asks whose phone am I calling from? That I am calling from a truck driver's phone. Move aside then, I'll repair it. Why should I listen to you? There is alcohol in my truck. Do you want me to get drunk and twist my moustaches? Come on, move back. There, it has started. No thank you before you leave? Thank you. There, even Binder is here. He is a very nice person. He never behaves like a boss. He owns such a big transport company.. ..and yet you can see him on a truck more than the drivers. - That's why he owns such a big transport company. - True. As the elders say, hard work always pays. His father has started the tradition of working hard. That's why he and his uncle are having a good life these days. Take It. I have got your 5570 repaired. Don't break your head over it again. Son, trucks gets repaired with the love and affection your family gives. I hope you didn't waste money on a mechanic. What's true for the cards ain't true for people. Bye. Hello, Mr. Neek Singh. Times have changed. First wooden Mercury then Ace. Then Ashok Leyland. Now even Mercedes has started manufacturing trucks. But one thing hasn't changed. Girls. Same old story. Truck drivers get drunk. They trouble girls. They twist their moustaches. If we have them, we will twist them for sure. Is uncle permitted to interrupt this conversation.. ..between grandfather and grandson? Where have you been, uncle? Sucha Singh from Gagan. They have organized ladies musical ceremony at their residence. We need to go there tomorrow. Sure, you can go. You will go with me. What will I do there? Gama's truck has broken down. It's making a lot of noise. He has to go to Bombay. - I was thinking of repairing its chassis. - Damn. I have noticed that my father, my brother and you. Have spent your life romancing these trucks. Stupid! You should enjoy a few parties as well. Who knows, you might end up liking a living creation of God. Uncle, you are such a pervert even at this age. Men and horses never grow old, nephew. Fine, uncle. If you insist, I'll go there. Who knows, I might meet someone accidentally. Brother, ask her why is so late? Brother, my scooter had broken down. And my phone's battery was also dead. Can't you change your tuition's timings? Your education is of no good to us. We are getting you educated.. ..but that doesn't mean we give you the license to do as you please. - Do you understand? - What do you mean? Come here, girl. You should mind your manners while talking to a girl. You are pampering her a lot, mother. I have pampered you all, not her! You couldn't even clear high school. She is dedicative towards studying so why don't let her? "When you walk, my heart stops." Let's go now. Go where? My legs are yet to start hurting. When will we leave then? My brothers will kill me. - Let's go. - "You have stepped out of the house.." Come on, Kiran. You can dance in your own house. You have ruined my mood now. Neither are you having a good time.. ..nor are you letting me have a good time. You always do that. "She applies henna on her heels and walks on toes." Listen, let's go. - Where? - Let's go inside. "She applies henna on her heels and walks on toes." Why? Has the auspicious hour began now? Let's go and dance on the stage. Let's dance till your legs hurt. Or else you will say that I didn't let you dance. Stop pulling my arm. - Let's go. Come on. - Hurry up. Should we go give the gift? You go ahead, uncle. Okay. "She wants to swim Chenab." "She wants to take Babbu's name." "She wants to find Mirza, she wants to catch hold of Majhnu." "She wants to catch hold of Majhnu." "She wants to swim Chenab." "She wants to take Babbu's name." "She wants to find Mirza." "She wants to catch hold of Majhnu." "This piece of jaggery melts on fire." "She applies henna on her heels and walks on toes." "You have stepped out of the house, now there is no going back for you." Okay, so I have done my duty here. Shall we leave now? - Can we wait for a few more minutes? - Why? So that I can socialize a little? You need to give the truck back to Dharma. Dharma won't be coming. Why? Dharma isn't well. - Really? - Yes. I think you aren't well either. I was a pervert so now you. Let's go. Come on. Come on, now. Standing in the middle of the road. Do you have a death wish? Move aside. Can't you see that it has broken down? It had broken down the other day. Today you are just pretending that it is. How do you know? My truck can carry 500 scooters to Bombay. I can touch and know whether my truck has high blood pressure or low sugar. Move aside. No. Truck drivers get drunk. They twist their moustaches. They trouble girls as well. Now I know that people lie. I see. There are so good truck drivers are well. Forgive me, dear. Your scooter is working just fine. Yes, but there is something wrong with me. I think I have caught the love fever. There is a cure for dengue. But there is no cure for love. Oh no. I will get cured if you support me. Whom do I call next? Is everything fine, uncle? You look upset. What is wrong? Nothing. Druggie Pal who drives 9090? - Yes? - He ran away. His truck is loaded. Goods need to reach Kolkata. I don't know what to do now. It's okay. It can go tomorrow morning. Well done. What's the use after the need is gone? It is loaded with firecrackers, stupid. Diwali is approaching. It's okay, they can use it for Guru Nanak Jayanti instead. - It's not a big deal. - Listen! I am not going this time. Go there. Who knows, you might end up liking a living creation of God there. Who knows I might end up meeting one here? Here? What's here? You won't understand, uncle. This is between me and Neek Singh. - Okay. - Yes. So love is in the air. Hats off to that girl.. ..who made your heart beat like other boys. But remember son, the romance that you are doing.. ..you will need my help to take things further. So my boy, go deliver the goods. Okay, I'll see. - I'll seek advice. - Okay. So you seek advice from someone other than me. You have found a nice meeting place here. You sit here and keep staring at this dirty pond. This is a swimming pool for buffalos. Buffalos are bathed here. Now can buffalos who provide us with milk be dirty? There is a solution. Tell your father to form a mineral water lake here. I don't understand your philosophies, Waris Shah. It's okay. You have a lifetime left to understand. For the time being you should know.. ..that the driver has contracted dengue.. ..so I will have to go to Kolkata instead of the driver. Kolkata? When will you come back? In 10 days. 10 days! I'll go crazy in 10 days. What is 10 days? 5 days to go and 5 days to come back. I will be with you the next day. 10 days! Do you know how long that is? You are Binder? Yes. And you are Deepi? Yes. Her family has gone to send her to Canada. They left? She didn't go willingly. They forced her to go with her aunt. She doesn't have her aunt's address. But she has told me that she lives in Surrey. Any message? She cried and said that she'll wait for you.. ..till you don't come to take her back. Thank you. "My heart is inconsolable." "How do I console it?" "My heart is inconsolable." "How do I console it?" "How do distract it from love.." "How do distract it from love and divert its attention elsewhere?" "My heart is inconsolable." "How do I console it?" "My heart is inconsolable." "How do I console it?" "Like a child when carried around the waist." "It keeps slipping away. "How do I see it break right before my eyes?"

"And let you make slippers of them." "My heart is inconsolable." "How do I console it?" "My heart is inconsolable." "How do I console it?" "I am tired of explaining." "It didn't stop even after getting hurt." "It says this world isn't so bad." "I should give it a try again." "I am tired of explaining." "It didn't stop even after getting hurt."

"My heart is inconsolable." "How do I console it?" You'll enjoy these sights initially. Hey, hello. Fasten your seatbelt, man. I am the one who can help you. I will show you around as well. To teach you how to drive. To get you a license. It is all my responsibility. I taught you how to ride a full size cycle. We aren't going to discuss that. About the cycle. You troubled me a lot while teaching me. I couldn't even touch my feet. Here I can't let go of the steering wheel. Can you ever reach the brakes? There will be times when I hit the brakes.. ..and ask you to hold the steering wheel. God will save us. The blind manages to meet the leper by chance. I didn't expect to meet one so far away. Just by chance. But who is blind here and who is leper? I am blind in love. And Canada has made you a leper. - Well said. - Yes. Leper. Blind. Blinded by Kiran's love I have reached Canada. You are so lucky. You got a driving license in just two months. Here you go. Thank you. Now you can go to drink coffee in a truck. And you know that it is hard to survive without a car? - License? - What? Kiran too must have made one then. Oh, yeah. One cannot do without a license here. Find out then. She must have made a license. It will also contain her name and address. You have hit a jackpot. I have got five addresses. You are lucky. Check it. Now find out which one of these Kiran is yours. Who's there? - Hello, aunt. - Hello. Aunt? I am Billi. Are you Kiran's aunt? Yes. Kiran used to stay here? Yes, she was. But they moved to Calgary. He is my friend. He wanted to meet her. Since he was here, he thought he should meet her. They stay close back in the village. - Can we get her number of something? - Her address? Sure, I have it. - Give me just a minute. - So nice of you. - Here's her address. - Oh, Yes! Thank you. - It's her address? - Yes. Here you go, buddy. We did it. I got her address. Kiran's address. Thank you. Wow! You are awesome, man. Okay, I forgive you for every thing. I deserve a big treat now. - Right? - Yes. We should celebrate. Two hoggers have got together, poor burgers will have to suffer. Touch your heart say it, we deserve a party. We deserve it, don't we? A treat, for Kiran? Yes, you deserve it. - Yes! - Yeah!

"She is in a mood to love." "She is in a mood to love." "I am in the mood to dance all night." "I am in the mood to dance all night." "I am in the mood to dance all night." Yes. I have always been like this. Okay. When I saw you, I felt that.. Binder! Oh, my God! It is such a beautiful place. I wonder why haven't I seen this place before.. ..in spite of living in Canada for so many years? This is favourite place of Binder. Whenever he passes by, he stops here. Then he sits here and stares at it. It reminds him of the lake in our village. He feels jealous, why isn't the water in his village lake this clean. - Are you kidding me? - Yeah. You know what, Binder? When I was running to save my life.. ..I never knew that the person.. ..I will meet would introduce me to such a beautiful life. Life is so beautiful. You see life like.. ..your mind shows it to you. When you feel sad.. ..then your heart is sad. When you feel happy.. ..then life looks like an arc of colors. The arc of colors? You mean a rainbow? Right? Same thing. Arc, rainbow. Or Kiran! Oh my god Binder. I have come so far. But now I am feeling very nervous. You were very brave while spinning your tales. Why are you feeling scared now? But you know what? Do you have another story to tell? No. Speak your heart out. You will neither get to meet Binder again nor such an opportunity. - Shut up, Billi. - Okay. Okay. Stop right there. My boyfriend will meet me here. Stop. Stop. I will miss you. Good luck. Good luck to you too. Bye, Billi. Bye, sister-in-law. Miss you too. Binder! Now that I am leaving, can I say something? If there wasn't a girl in your life.. And if there wasn't a boy in my life.. Then there couldn't have been a boy better than you for me. Getting sentimental now? Go. Bye! Hey! - How are you? - Great. I missed you so much. Who was he? Stranger. A complete stranger who risked even his life.. ..to protect a girl who took a lift from him. Oh, he must really be a great man. He is. Now do we go to a hotel or do we go home? Wherever. But we have to go to the court first thing tomorrow morning. Simmi, do you have any idea who they are? You want to testify because of Jaz, right? She is dead. But you and I are alive. And your life is at risk. We have another option instead. A bright future. End of all the problems. How so? I know some of their men. I'll talk to them and ask.. ..whether will they help us get settled if you don't testify. It is a big deal for us to settle down.. ..but it is a very small thing for them. I hope you understand. I understood. What did you understand? - It's over. - Over? What's over? We are over. Like you don't want to drink at all? Fine. You are in Calgary now. You have sister-in-law's address. That must be giving you enough high. I like your love story. Awesome. Great. And grandfather's story, Mr. Neek Singh's story.. What happened with your father.. ..Mr. Nachchattar Singh in '84? Who can forget '84? The year 1984 was like hell for all Punjabis. Yes. Hail to Lord Mahadev! Hail to Lord Mahadev! I will have to fight with them. A Sikh can never run away from a battlefield. I rather embrace death.. ..than run away. Bring up my child with a lot of love. Hail to Lord Mahadev! Hail to Lord Mahadev! Hold the steering wheel. Stop here. Farewell. Goodbye. See you in next life. Get him! Baba, what happened to those murderers? What would happen to them? Half of them lived a good life and died. The other half are old and ready to die. The government is still looking for proof. - Yes? - Hello. Hi. Kiran? Kiran isn't at home. Who are you? I am her classmate. I have come from India. I thought I should meet her as I am in Canada. I see. Kiran has gone to work. Okay. Any address? Your honor, there is no point wasting anymore time on this case. The only so called witness is nowhere to be found. So that means there is no witness to this case. No, sir. There is a witness. Judge praised the brave Simmi Sandhu.. ..and questioned the integrity of the entire police department. And he ordered that the corrupt police officers.. ..should be investigated by the CIA. That is Punjab's brave girl, Simmi Sandhu. Simmi! Simmi! Didn't you get scared while testifying against such dangerous people? Simmi! Tell me, Simmi. Please reply, Simmi. Simmi, Simmi! Kiran! Binder is here! Stupid, it takes a little time to cross the seven seas. I can even cheat death for you. I didn't know. The worst was when they kept a dagger around my neck and said.. ..that if I don't agree to get married to him then they will kill you. You turned out to be so weak in spite of being surrounded.. ..by the strong arms of your love? One message from you and I had put my life on a standstill. Only to see that you were helpless? You throw me into the sea and ask.. Binder, do you know how to swim? I kept my promise.. And you? And you kept ruining it for me. Can your helpless.. ..give me those days back? My piece of heaven.. ..you stole it. You filled my life with only dark nights.. ..with no dawn in sight. You gifted me with sorrow of a lifetime. Why you did this? Kiran! Hey, Kiran! Are you done? Who is he? He is Binder. He's from my village. We met here coincidently. - Let's go. - Come on. Let's go. 'Coincidently?' 'Stupid, I loved you so much that my nature changed.' 'Otherwise, this meeting would have ended differently.' 'I had come to take you, and yet I leave without you.' 'I was alone before, and I am alone now as well.' "Life is a gamble." "I lost the gamble." "Pushing me into the storm." "You swam ashore." "Life is a gamble." "I lost the gamble." "Pushing me into the storm." "You swam ashore." "I kept singing your praises even as I drowned." "I kept you close to my heart." "I kept you close to my heart." "And you kept playing with my heart." "I kept you close to my heart." "And you kept playing with my heart." "I am a crazy fool." "You are very shrewd and smart." "You too no time to forget my love." "I am a crazy fool." "You are very shrewd and smart." "You too no time to forget my love." "I gave you my blood." "You presented me with poison." "I kept you close to my heart." "I kept you close to my heart." "And you kept playing with my heart." "I kept you close to my heart." "And you kept playing with my heart." "First you broke the oars, then you pushed me." "I had no funeral, my ashes where submerged into the river." "First you broke the oars, then you pushed me." "I had no funeral, my ashes where submerged into the river." "I kept offering you my hand, but kept letting go of my hand." "I kept you close to my heart." "I kept you close to my heart." "And you kept playing with my heart." "I kept you close to my heart." "And you kept playing with my heart." "If you had taken my hand, I would have survived the sea." "I would have bravely faced any storm." "If you had taken my hand, I would have survived the sea." "I would have bravely faced any storm." "Tell me, for what past sins am I repenting here?" "I kept you close to my heart." "I kept you close to my heart." "And you kept playing with my heart." "I kept you close to my heart." "And you kept playing with my heart." Hi! Hello! What's wrong? All alone today? Yes, Billi is gone for a local round. I am talking about Kiran. Not all love stories end happily like Neek Singh's did. There are some which don't meet the right end. Kiran's love failed. I am sorry, Binder. It's okay. My heart will cry and little then calm down. Tell me, what happened with you. Left. He left you or you left him? I left him. He had no morals. So what now, you want someone else? Honestly speaking.. Billi had told me that this is your favourite place. That's why I keep coming here. So that I get to meet you, by chance. So that I can talk a little with you? You don't do little talks. In fact, I just have one thing to say today. Perhaps, I didn't feel it when I was with you. But after you kept I many times felt.. ..that I am in love with you. Feeling and being are two different things. I too had felt that Kiran was in love with me. Listen to me. Bye. Binder! I have become so simple because of you. I have even stopped colouring my beard. It is good as it is. Very good. Talking like me, are you now? Oh man! She is after you. Hi, I am here. What are you doing here? I wanted to talk to you. That day you said that feeling that you are in love.. ..and being in love are two different things. So now I know, I am in love with you. For real. It is possible.. You think so.. I don't. Can I say something? I've explained this earlier as well. - It can never be you. - What? What do you mean? - Hey Billi. - Hey, hi. Billi, ask him to apologize. Otherwise, I won't get in the truck. Who is asking you to? Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, please stop! Let me get in. Fine, I am sorry. Please, listen to me. Let the beautiful girl in. "I had small piece of land, did whatever I can." "I also liked to drive." "I also liked to drive." "I had small piece of land, did whatever I can." "I also liked to drive."
