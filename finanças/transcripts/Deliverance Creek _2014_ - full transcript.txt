I COULD ARRANGE FOR A WHITE MAN TO BUY MOSES BACK. - WHY ARE YOU SAYING ALL THIS? - YOU REALLY BROKE INTO YOUR MASTER'S SAFE? YOU SHOW ME HOW YOU DID IT, YOU HAVE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY BACK TOGETHER IN A WEEK. - WHITE FOLKS ALWAYS PROMISE THINGS. BUT ALL THEY DELIVER IS PAIN. - MAYBE IT'LL BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME. LOOK, HERE'S ONE SHE MADE EARLIER. - SO ALL WE GOT TO DO IS STEAL TWO KEYS, WHICH ARE PROBABLY IN THE BANK. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, ROB THE GODDAMN BANK TWICE? - THEY'RE NOT GONNA KEEP THE KEYS TO THE BANK IN THE BANK, JASPER. - LOOK, I SAY WE FORGET ALL THAT, OKAY? WHEN THE GOLD GETS HERE, WE JUST HOLD 'EM UP AS THEY'RE LOADING IT IN THE BACK OF THE VAULT. - HOW MANY SOLDIERS YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA HAVE PROTECTING THAT GOLD, TOBY-- 40, 50? WHAT, YOU THINK THE GATLIN GANG IS GONNA BE ABLE TO FIGHT OFF AN ENTIRE UNION REGIMENT? - BELLE'S RIGHT, ALL RIGHT? THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO THIS. - AND IF DONE RIGHT, NO ONE GETS HURT-- NOT US, NOT ANYONE IN DELIVERANCE. ONLY PEOPLE GONNA FEEL ANY PAIN IS CRAWFORDS... WHEN THEY OPEN THAT VAULT, FIND IT AS EMPTY AS MY PANTRY. - AND WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE, BELLE? I MEAN, WHY ARE WE TRUSTING A NEGRO WE DON'T EVEN DAMN WELL KNOW? - BECAUSE SHE'S QUICK AS A WINK, AND WITHOUT HER, WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW TO BREAK INTO A SAFE. - OH, YEAH, AND SHE CAN ALSO TURN ON US JUST LIKE THAT. [snaps fingers] TAKE ALL THE REWARD MONEY AND LEAVE US HANGING OUT DRY IN THE TOWN SQUARE. - I'LL BE LONG GONE BY THEN. - YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? SHE'S UPPITY. - I'M A RUNAWAY SLAVE. WHO AM I GONNA GO RUNNING TO? WHO AM I GONNA TELL? I'M HERE FOR ONE REASON-- THAT'S TO GET MY SHARE AND COLLECT MY FAMILY, THEN I'M GONE. - CORDELIA'S GONNA HAVE ONE KEY. - IT'S PROBABLY HANGING AROUND HER NECK. - GOOD, 'CAUSE I'M GONNA STRANGLE HER WITH IT. - BEN CRAWFORD PROBABLY HAS THE OTHER ONE. - MRS. MILLER. - HELLO, BEN. - WHY DON'T YOU LET ME HELP YOU TODAY? - THAT'S MIGHTY NICE OF YOU, BEN. - HERE WE GO. OH. PARDON ME. NOW, LET ME... - [humming] [thumping] [distant horse whinnies] - GARRET, HEAD ON OVER TO FONTAINE. PICK ME UP A LOAD OF PINE PLANKS. USE BELLE'S WAGON. RUNT, I WANT YOU TO FIND ME FOUR DEAD POSSUM, MUSKRAT, WHATEVER. THE DEADER, THE BETTER. [men chuckle] - DUTCH, YOU'RE ABOUT MY SIZE. SO TAKE FINN HERE OVER TO LAFAYETTE AND PICK TOBY AND I UP A COUPLE BLACK WOOL SUITS. AND HOW ABOUT A COUPLE TOP HATS AND TIES? - TOP HATS? TIES? I THOUGHT WE WAS ROBBING A BANK. - WHO THE HELL SAYS WE AIN'T? - WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT IS ALL THIS? - Y'ALL GOT A JOB TO DO. GET. - COME ON, THEN. - HEY, CYRIL. CYRIL... YOU EVER QUESTION MY AUTHORITY AGAIN IN FRONT OF MY MEN, I WILL KILL YOU. - I MUST SAY, IT'S A POINT OF PRIDE THAT YOU'VE CHOSEN OUR BANK, MAJOR MCCALLISTER. MY FAMILY IS LOYAL UNION SUPPORTERS. THE WALLS ARE SOLID BRICK, AND THE VAULT IS SOLID STEEL. - THE VAULT'S NOT READY. - OH, THEY'RE JUST FINISHING NOW. IS IT READY? - YES, MA'AM. - MM-HMM. - I DON'T THINK MANY BANKS, EVEN IN NEW YORK CITY, HAVE ONE. IT WAS JUST INVENTED LAST YEAR. - STILL, I'D LIKE TO HAVE ONE OF MY MEN POSTED INSIDE YOUR BANK. - WELL, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. WE HAVE OUR OWN SECURITY INSIDE THE BANK. - [imitates gunshots] OH, GOD, NO! NO, NOT ME, OH! [imitates gunshot] LOOK HOW EASY THAT WOULD BE, LIKE PICKING FAT TICKS OFF A SLEEPING DOG. INSTEAD, HERE WE SIT, IDLE. SEEMS QUEER, DON'T IT? IF TOBY AND JASPER DON'T COME OUT THAT BANK TONIGHT WITH BAGS OF GOLD, WE'RE GOING IN AND DO WHAT WE SHOULD'VE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AS LONG AS JASPER'S TAKING ORDERS FROM HIS LITTLE SISTER, YOU'RE ALL TAKING ORDERS FROM ME, YOU HEAR? - YES, SIR. - YEAH. - OH, BEN. - I GOT YOUR NOTE. EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? - IT IS. IT'S JUST, I WENT OUT TO SEE KESSIE THIS MORNING, AND SHE'S ANXIOUS TO SEE HER BOYS. SHE WANTS TO HEAD OUT TOMORROW, FIRST THING. - THAT'S WHEN WE'RE DOING THE UNION PAYROLL. WE COULD SET OUT THE NEXT DAY, WHEN THINGS SETTLE. - I MEAN, I CAN TAKE HER, I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE BOYS ARE, BEN. - I-I DON'T-- I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO ALONE. - IT DOESN'T TAKE TWO OF US, BEN. IF WE FEEL LIKE IT'S SAFE, I CAN TAKE HER. I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHERE. SO YOU DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE IT? - NOW, HATTIE GATLIN, THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAID. - YOU DON'T HAVE TO-- IT'S WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE, WHICH IS INCREDIBLY INSULTING, SINCE I'VE ALREADY DONE A FEW RUNS ON MY OWN. WHAT? - THAT'S NOT WHAT'S WRITTEN ON MY FACE HERE... THAT'S ALL. - BEN CRAWFORD, IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING. THEN JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU-- - NOW, I'M WORKING ALL NIGHT TONIGHT... AND PROBABLY HALF THE DAY TOMORROW. THEN YOU AND I WILL TAKE KESSIE TO SEE HER BOYS... TOGETHER. - YOU'VE GOT YOUR LANTERN, A POT OF COFFEE, AND A BUCKET. - HOW GENEROUS, AUNT CORDELIA. - I'LL BE BACK AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING. I GOT YOU THIS SHOTGUN. YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE TO USE IT. - YOU ASKED ME TO DO THIS, SO I'M HERE. - I RAISED YOU LIKE A SON. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I TRUST. - [sighs] HATTIE KNOWS THE KIDS ARE STAYING WITH MOM, BUT... IN CASE ANYTHING GOES WRONG... - I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT-- - DON'T. THAT WORKS FOR SOME, BUT NOT FOR YOU. - COME ON, BELLE. I'M SORRY, OKAY? I'M--I'M SORRY THAT I NEVER SAW WHAT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY OWN DAMN FACE, AND IF I COULD GO BACK AND DO IT OVER AGAIN, I WOULD-- I WANT TO. - IT DON'T WORK THAT WAY, TOBY. YOU KNOW THAT. - AFTER THIS ROBBERY, LET'S JUST LEAVE, OKAY? JUST YOU AND ME, AND WE'LL START A NEW FAMILY, AND I'LL--I'LL RAISE YOUR KIDS AS MY OWN, AND WE'LL HAVE MORE KIDS. BELLE, WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE BOY. [man shouts in the distance] - WE'RE CLOSED. - BUT IT AIN'T EVEN 5:00 YET. - DON'T YOU SEE ALL THE COMMOTION AROUND HERE, BOY? - PLEASE, SIR. MY MA, MY PA, MY TWO BROTHERS-- THEY ALL GOT TOOK BY THE SMALLPOX. - THE SMELL OF "PUTREFICATION" IS A SURE SIGN OF THE SMALLPOX. I AIN'T TOUCHING THEM BODIES, BOY. - YOU DON'T NEED TO DO NOTHING. I JUST NEED A PLACE TO PUT 'EM FOR TONIGHT. - ON THREE. - YES, SIR. - THREE. - [grunts] [both grunting] - ALL RIGHT. DON'T JUST STAND THERE, BOY. GO. - UH, YES, SIR. - GO. GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
