♪♪ Lord, this brother, here, he's in a lot of trouble. So all I'm asking is, is there a way for me to go, if that's what's supposed to happen? And this brother gets saved, somehow. I guess it's up to you, so...whatever's gonna happen, is gonna happen. [phone ringing] [Reggie] My father's a sports executive. He met my moms when he was just a lawyer for the local NBA team. She was a cheerleader for the team. They were together long enough for me and my sister to be born. He left my mom when she was pregnant with my little brother, Vince. He couldn't keep it in his pants, so Moms kicked him out. Moms was proud like that. She wouldn't even accept child support, which means we didn't have no money. Moms was just like that. Any episodes since the last visit? No, I've been good. Okay, good. [Reggie] When I was 12, I got mixed up with these street cats. And here I am, with no pops, nobody to look out for me on these streets, but they helped me, so I did some work for 'em. I did it so I could walk up and down these streets without being shot. [ rap music ♪] [gunshots] J-Bone. He was the man. He ran the blocks like a soldier. I mean, he could do whatever he wanted to do. [gunshots] As far as I know, no one ever crossed him and lived to tell about it. To me, he was like a big brother. One day, I took a bullet. I lived, but Moms didn't have money to pay the medical bills, so she gave up, sent me to live with my pops. A little while later, Bone got locked up for some dirt. I haven't seen him since. I never forgot where I come from, though. [metallic clanking] [rap music ♪] [breathes deeply] ♪♪ Nigga, what's up? Welcome back. [laughs] You still doing that thing? Oh yeah. Everything straight?

It's just a matter of time before he's back up to some kind of dirt. All right, so he's made some mistakes. We both know he's not the only one around here who's made mistakes. Look. I don't deny the fact that I'm partly responsible for Joseph's incarceration. I make no apologies for that. But he is a thief and a criminal. Doesn't matter what crime he went down for. He was going down and I wasn't gonna let you go down with him. [piano music on stereo] [dramatic music] [sighs] Somebody there? Who the hell is it? Cataracts getting worse, huh, Pop? Joseph? Yeah... It's me, Pop. Come to visit your old man. Good. Pour yourself a drink. [gunshot] [screaming] [gunshot] Oh, damn, boy! What the hell is wrong with you? Oh, Lord. Jesus Christ.

Like you're a gangster, or a thug, or whatever it is you think you are. I know where you used to live. And you don't live there anymore. You need to start acting like who you are. And who is that? A young man with something to lose. Your days of chilling and hanging out are over. You are coming to work at the dome. You will start in marketing and rotate around to every department 'til we find something that fits. And you can forget about that nepotism crap, too. You will work. You will come to the office early and you will leave late. And that is the end of it. Oh, shit. Boy, what you doin'? [groaning in pain] Oh shit. I never hurt you bad, boy. I only tried to toughen you up. Boy, what you doin'? [trunk slams] [screaming, pounding] How'd your doctor's appointment go? It was all right. Same old thing, you know. I still blame that boy for getting you shot. Damn, dad. Look, he didn't get me shot. I did. Can we just get off of this right now? It's starting to give me a headache. Okay. All right. You hungry? Mmm. Where you wanna go? I don't know. Whatever's open. Yeah, I gotta stop and get some cash right quick. [rap music ♪] Let's roll so we can catch this nigga, man. You handled it? Everything is cool, baby. [engine revving] You know, I was gonna wait 'til Vincent's graduation to tell you, but I think now is the time. I have something for you. Something like what? This is for you. What is it? If, after a year, you show me you've done some good work, and you show me you can be responsible, you can have that. You can do whatever you want. But you have to make me a promise. What? That you'll stay away from him. Ah, come on, Dad. Promise me. All right. I promise. Give me a minute. [cell phone ringing] Ah, shit. [gunshot] Somebody help me! Hold on. Don't die on me. Somebody fucking help me! Somebody help me. The death of Brother Ben is tragic. A devastating loss, and not just for the family, but for our community, who proudly counted him as a conscientious citizen, but... but more than that. Much more than that. As a friend. And we have to keep our friends in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts and minds. And how do we do that? How do we do that? By resisting the temptations of anger and vengeance. By redoubling our efforts to eradicate this disease of evil whose symptoms are drugs and violence. By reconnecting with God. And rebuilding our injured community. We must become more vigilant in our commitment to our community. I would ask you all to bow your heads, take a moment of silent prayer and contemplation. [Reggie] When I look back on it now, this is when it all start to fall apart. I listen to all this talk about the community. About staying together. But the only thing I could think about was... was revenge. [cell phone ringing] Hello? Who dis? Reggie? Hey, Ma. What's up? I just called to remind you that it's your brother's graduation this Saturday, and he expects you to be there. [mouths] Damn. You didn't forget, did you? No, Ma. I didn't forget. Reggie. You're not the only one that's hurting. I know. I know. What time? Uh, four. Um... we're having some people over afterwards for a little food. I'll be there. [cell phone beeps] Hol--hold on one second, Ma. [cell phone beeps] Yo. Yo, man. It's Bone. Yo, Bone. Hold on one second.

Kinda stocky build. Got a low haircut. [Reggie] And somehow, looking to get the guy who shot my father, even doing it with J, it didn't seem as bad as doing nothing at all. [music, quiet conversations] Yo, look up here. Look right up here. [laughing] Oh my God, man. Y'all see this? We looking at a bunch of clowns, man. That's a birthday party. Yeah, there he is! Blue shirt! Nah, that's the local preacher. He look like a local gay scientist to me. [laughs] Son of a bitch. [laughing] Gentlemen. Ah...lady. Can I help you all? Nah, Pops. We was just, uh, in the neighborhood. We're looking for a party or something. Well, you found a party. This is, um... my daughter's 21st birthday. Nah, this ain't what we looking for. You know what I mean? Yeah, I think I know what you mean. But uh, if you all can promise to behave yourself, uh...you're welcome. That's cool, Revvy Rev, but we gonna have to pass on this one. We gonna keep it moving. Well then, y'all have a peaceful night. Whatchu lookin' at man? What, you might know me or something? No, nothing. No, I just thought... Come on, let's go. Save that noise, Preach. [engine revving] God bless ya. Yo, we gonna find that bitch ass nigga that shot Benson, we gonna be out. I've been ready since yesterday. Jamal, where you say them busters kick it at? North Park, near Lembrook, dog. That's where them fools be at. [laughs] A'ight, business man. Still, what was more important than talking to your little sister? It's not even like that, Tosh. Just had to do a few things, take care of some business. You should be minding your business. [television] Various family members were hit by gunfire at 12:30 last night, in what police suspect was a drug related shooting. Mrs. Flo Jenson and her four children were all wounded - in this house behind me. - Shit. Eight year old Clara Jenson was seriously wounded while she slept in her bed. Mrs. Jenson's 18 year old son, Philip Jenson, did not fare so well. He died at the scene. I'm talking with Lieutenant Phil Hudson. Lieutenant Hudson, any new information? Nothing conclusive. We're in the process of going house to house, trying to tie down leads. Can you give us some explanation as to the motivation for this senseless attack? Well, we believe the intended target was Philip Jenson, a local dealer with ties to smuggling and gun running. Other family members were just victims of circumstance. And what are the chances that the perpetrators will be brought to justice? We believe that the combined efforts of law enforcement in the community is what's needed to prevent a repeat of this tragedy. Thank you. [sighs] Same old shit... Yeah. Same old story.

You wanna hear that old ass story, yeah. [whistles] [rhythmic drumming] [gunshots] [gunshots] [horn honking] That's a good story, but not exactly as I remember it. Whatchu talking' bout? What, now you don't remember the story? Anyway. Anyway, listen. I just want to say pardon me for earlier, man. I don't really know what hit me, man. I'm just-- Shh. Cool, baby. You got lucky too, man. I was about to take my present back. - Present? - Mhmm. What you got for me? [laughs] [Reggie] I remember what my father said about him. I knew who he was, what he was capable of. But being with a brother like J... Thanks, Pete. [Reggie] Knowing you was with him, with his crew, it just felt better being on his side. When I went in, I wasn't scared. Not even the first night. Looked at those cats on the bus. You know, some cats looked scared, most of them try to look hard. You know, throwing up gang signs and shit, talking all loud. It was like they thought, the louder they talked, the less somebody would mess with them. I can't even imagine what that's like. That first night... everybody was hoping that they wouldn't be the ones who got got. I mean, cats were being beaten, raped, you name it. But nobody fucked with me. No, it, it was like they were trying to make me feel comfortable so they could sneak me. Then about a week went by, and five cats came into my cell and beat on me for about a hour. And then they just walked away like nothing happened. I know you got them niggas back, though. [laughs] Nah. Nah, see. It wasn't personal. They just wanted to let me know, that no matter how big I was, no matter how hard I was, they could get to me. I respected them niggas for that. They helped me. Like my pops. Whatchu talking' about? Thank you, Pops. [J-Bone's father's voice] Come visit your old man. Good. They reminded me that no matter what they did to me, it would never compare to what my pops did to me every day of my life. See, my pops, he prepared me for what was coming. He taught me how to survive without him. In his own special way. You should have thanked him. I did. Yo, nigga. You got me all off track, nigga.

Look, if taking a human life is worth 40 bucks to you, then that means that's what you think your life is worth. Commit murder? Then there's no turning back, son. Your own life will never be the same. Or maybe you know that already. Don't hear this shit. Wait a minute. - I know you. - Nah, you don't know me. Reggie, you can't blame yourself for your father's death. You're in pain, but killing someone is just gonna make it worse. It's not gonna make it better, and it's certainly not gonna bring him back. You think you know me, Rev? You think you know me? Get on your fucking knees. Get on your knees! Lord... That ain't gonna save you now. I guess I'm supposed to be beggin' for my life here, but you know what? If I go, that means, brother here, he's in a lot of trouble. That shit ain't gonna save you now. So all I'm asking is, is there a way for me to go if that's what's supposed to happen? Where's your god now, huh? And this brother gets saved somehow. I mean. It's in your hands. I don't know... - ...what to do here. - Praying. I, I've talked to this brother the best way I know how and I guess, I guess it's up to you. But like I say, I'm ready to go. I've got nothing to worry about, so Lord, it's in your hands. I don't know what to do here. So whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen. [gunshot] Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on man. We gotta get out of here. Let's roll. Shit. Get the gun. [breathing heavily] I killed him. I think. I killed him. That's right, baby. You handled your business. I'm proud of you. Let's roll. [television reporter] We're reporting live here from downtown, where the city is in shock this morning at the news of the second murder within a month of a high profile member of the community, shot dead at an ATM machine. Reverend James Packer was murdered late last night. Ironically, moments after he had just deposited his parish's weekend collection. Investigators are not-- [Reggie] They say you can't take back mistakes. I guess if I knew then what I know now, I crossed a line that night that should have never been crossed. And I felt I just, I had to do something. [Reverend Packer's voice] Reggie. You can't blame yourself for your father's death. Killing someone is certainly not gonna bring him back. [Benson Cooper's voice] Just a matter of time before he's back into some kind of dirt. Right now you have everything a man could ever want. All I want is for you to take advantage of it. All I'm asking is, this brother gets saved... somehow. You need to start acting like who you are, Reggie. Who you are... who you are... who you are... who you are... What the hell was I doing? I honestly don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I didn't mean-- - ...up here, Mom. I'm Alicia. Cool. I'm... Reggie. Reggie Cooper. Oh, I think I remember. My father spoke at your father's funeral, right? Yeah. He did. Thanks for coming. No...don't, don't thank me. I just, um... thought I'd come by... pay my respects. This has gotta be hard on you right now. You're probably the only one here who really knows how I feel. It was nice to see you. Yeah, you too. Thanks again for coming. If you ever want to talk, you should give me a call. I'll do that. Bye. [sighs] Mama? Yes. What is this? Oh... those belonged to your daddy. He started this scrapbook when you were a little girl. And... he has a record of his whole life in this journal. His thoughts, his feelings, his prayers... his dreams for you. Can I read it? Mhmm. And you know what? I think it might be nice for you to take it into his study and read it. Have a nice private talk with him. Okay? Hey. - Yo. What up, 'Mar? - Reggie Reg. - What's up, baby? - What's going on, baby? - You. You. - What's going on? Nah, we cleanin' up in here, man. - A'ight. - Talkin' doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs, you name it. We got it. They all freaks of the industry. - Hook me up. - Yo. See you later, baby. Yo, J! Yo, Bone! Damn, baby. Why you so late? I thought you were coming to put in some work. Yeah. I was sidetracked. I gotta go to this funeral. Funeral? Hold up. Now do me a favor. Tell Luke to recheck the count. Register's off. I'll be back in a minute. Now, tell me you didn't go to that preacher's funeral. [scoffs] Tell me you smarter than that. Yo, this ain't no game, son. This business is rollin' now. I'm about to have this entire thing locked down. Look, you ain't got to worry about me. I'm handling this. I hope so. 'Cause I won't let anything or anyone stand in my way. Including you. You got that? So you go, you get your head straight, nigga. When you ready to get down, you give me a call. You got it? - I got it. - You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Call me tonight. I'ma hit you later. [phone ringing] Tosha? Where you been? I've been trying to page you. It's not working. Yeah, I, I got a new number. That cell phone was dead. Listen, where's Ma? I need to talk to her. Oh, um. She went to the store with Vince. She's a little worried about you. What's up? Everything's fine, all right? I don't want y'all worrying about me. Tell Mom I'm all right. Okay. But I was glad you called. Um... Reggie, I wanna know if it's okay if I come over, um, Daddy's house for the weekend. I need some place to stay because... I just need some space, you know? You always up to something, man. Go ahead. The keys is where I always put them. You go. Yo, but don't mess up the house, neither. All right. Thanks. And um, Joseph called looking for you. Don't tell him you spoke to me, you hear me? Um. Okay.

I don't care what you believe, or how many times you ask me the question, you gonna get the same answer. I don't know him. Y'all hear me back there? [inaudible whispering] We got your partner next door. And he confessed to everything. He said you planned this one. - You're a goddamn liar. - Hmm. I don't know that dude, and you know that. Remember this? This is the gun we took off your partner. He says it belongs to you. Am I gonna find out that that is your gun, Reggie? No. Don't answer that. Maybe you wanna lawyer up now. I don't need no lawyer, 'cause I didn't do nothing. [knocking on door] [sighing] [knocking continues] Okay! Coming. Oh, it's you. Where's Reggie? I know he's having problems with his phone. You know, I don't know. He didn't say. Oh, so you heard from him? Yeah. Well, you know. I, I erased his phone number. You got it? [phone ringing] Hold on. Be right back. Hello? Hey, Ricky, sweetie. How you doing? Oh, no. That's cool. 'Cause I just got out the shower anyway. So, how long you gonna be? What time are you coming? All right. That's fine. No. [laughs] Uh, hey gorgeous. I'm out. You miss me? Aw... Looks like this is your lucky day, Mr. Cooper. Seems like your story checks out with the victim. My captain says you might have saved this lady's life. So, you're free to go.

I don't even know what to say. Is it okay if I'm calling you? Is that o-- I don't know if that's all right. I know it didn't make much sense, but there wasn't a way that I could tell her how I really met her that day. How you been? But I had this hole inside of me from the day that my dad got shot. And I had this fool idea that maybe she could help me fill it. Reggie? Hi. Come in. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. And no matter what my daughter told you, I don't bite. Um. Um... I'm so sorry about what happened to your husband. Thank you, Reggie. Thank you. And I was sorry to hear about your father. I heard that he was a very nice man. Anyway, welcome to our home.

You getting sensitive, right? Catching feelings for the preacher's daughter. Oh, my bad. You thought I didn't recognize her. Why you messin' with her? It ain't even like that, man. I bumped into her on the way in the spot, figured we have a few drinks, you know-- This ain't no game. You need to cut that shit off right now. Bone, I got this man. I can handle this. Don't worry about it. You better not slip up, brother. You know, ever since... Ever since the thing with the preacher, man... I've been a little on edge, man. I just need a little time for-- Fuck that preacher. That preacher got what he deserved. He was holding out, so you dealt with him. That's a done deal.

We used to hang out back in the day. You know, but uh... I ain't seen him in a while, so... Well, what happened? Did you guys have a fight or something? Nah, nah. Nothing like that. Just kicking it. And talking about some business. That's all. Reggie, should I know something? No, why do you say that? I don't know. You're just, you know... You're acting kind of mysterious. - Mysterious? - Yeah. How am I being mysterious? I just don't wanna mess up a good night, that's all. ...I don't, Bora Bora... or some crazy place like that, or whatever. So they tells me, so he like rents this yacht. So they go out on the yacht, and they're cruisin', the yacht gets stuck. So they had to take the little boat back to the island. So, they're stuck in the middle of the ocean. This-- right. So they get in the little boat and they, you know, start going back and they start looking in each other's eyes and the sun was going down and... It was that type of... - googly eyes and, you know. - Love at first sight. I wouldn't call it love at first sight. I, I don't really believe in love at first sight. Oh? What do you believe in then? I don't know. Everything's so fake nowadays. You know how you... open yourself up to people... [stammers] and let 'em in and show 'em love? It's like, it makes it so much easier for them to just stab you in the back. You know what I'm saying? Oh? Friends, family, your neighbors? None of that matters anymore. It's like, the more you let a person in, and they love you, and you love them and stuff like that, and I, I know I wanna know a lot about them. Oh... You mean, the easier it is for them to hurt you. You know... My father told me once that the only thing you can count on in this world is that people are gonna make mistakes. So you have to forgive. That's all love is. It's forgiveness. Forgiveness, huh? [cheering on TV] How was business tonight? Oh, you know. The numbers were good. Actually, the best night of the week. Why are you here? Where else am I gonna be? The Caribbean, or the south of France, Hollywood, you name it. Mmm. Sounds good. When do we leave? My point is... I'm not going anywhere. But you could. You could go anywhere, you could do anything you want, if you put your mind to it. Exactly. You're kidding. Okay. Thanks. What's going on? They lifted a partial off that gun from the mall robbery. You remember that Lieutenant Hudson I told you about up at the 22nd? Yeah. What do you think? Get this. The prints and the blood match the murdered preacher. Yeah, well...there's just one problem, detective. - What's that? - I never heard of this guy. He's not in the system. What, what about the other guy? Yeah, well that's a donut, too. Nothing so far, but I'll run this one statewide. I might wanna follow up with you. Anytime. Just give us a call. Lieutenant. [intercom beeping] Kline? Bring me the Packer file.

Put down your weapon and come out hands on head. [sirens] [helicopters] [police scanner] [gunshots] [sirens] [sirens, police scanner] Mr. Brown. No. It just might interest you to know that we've got you in custody because of a tip. Can I have a cigarette or something? Sure. Kline? You had a smooth operation going there, Joseph. You don't get your hands dirty anymore, do you? You get your flunkies to do it for you. Even get them to take bullets for you. I guess this is where I ask for my attorney. Sure, we can do that, and we'd just violate your ass back to prison. Or we could hold off on a lawyer for now. [sighs] Maybe we write it up that you're um... here of your own accord. That you're not under arrest, but you're cooperating with an investigation, hmm? I'm listening. We need some information, Joseph. We need to know what you know about the murder of Reverend James Packer. Yeah, I heard about him, man. That's a sad thing. Yeah, well, we think you know something about it. I mean, how you figure that? What do you know about a young man named Reggie Cooper? Coop, you mean, Coop? Yeah, yeah. Coop's from the hood, man. Um, what he gotta do with this? We have witnesses connecting you to him. We also know you two happened to have a falling out around the same time as the killing. Witnesses to what? What witnesses? Hmm. Guess it doesn't matter. You were asking me about a lawyer, weren't you? [sighs] Joseph, we got a tight bust here. We got associating with known felons. We got alcohol consumption. We've got stolen property. So... Hmm? You know, maybe Mr. Bone... needs to spend a little more time in his cell. No, that's not gonna be necessary. Well, tell us. I know y'all ain't got nothing on me. But maybe you could make things uncomfortable, so let's just say that it's in my best interest to give you what I know. Now, you give me 48 hours, I'll see what I can come up with. And then we can end all of this bad business between us. 24. 24. Who are you, Reggie Cooper? Why you always messin' with me, baby? Who am I? I think I know you... but I really don't. Do I? Are you serious? You showed up out of nowhere. We went on one date... ...and now we're inseparable. Isn't that strange to you? I mean... What do you want to find out about me? That I'm not perfect? Cause... I don't wanna ruin the surprise, baby, but... I'm not. Remember you said... "Past is the past" and "We should leave stuff in the past." What happened to that? Is it about your father? Look, why can't we just chill? Why you always gotta bring up all this sensitive shit? Talk about that right now. Okay. Fine. You're not telling us everything, Lieutenant. We found a gun that we think might be... involved in this killing. Where did you find it? Well, that's the sticky part, ma'am. I'm really not at liberty to tell you, right now. I see. I, I guess you know best. Thank you. Um, I'd like to ask you both a couple of questions. Could you tell me anything you might know about a young man called Reggie Cooper? Uh... that's my boyfriend. How long have you known him? About three or four months? Why? How well do you know him? Pretty well. We're very close. What's going on? What does Reggie have to do with this? Probably nothing. I wonder, could you tell me how you met him? He came to my father's viewing. My father spoke at his father's funeral. Benson Cooper. Yeah. If I may, Lieutenant, why are you asking all these questions about Reggie? We just gotta follow up on leads, ma'am. That's all. Tell me, Alicia. Is there anything unusual about this boy? I mean, anything you could like me to know? No, I can't think of anything. Well... Okay. I appreciate your time very much. Thank you. Thanks for your time. So long, Alicia. It's good to see you. Bye. It's nice to see you, too. You let us know what you find out. We deserve that much. You certainly do. Thanks for seeing me. Thank you. [phone ringing] - Yo. - Hi, Reggie. What's wrong? A police officer came here asking a lot of questions. Questions about you and my father. Police officer? What, what'd he say? He was asking how we met. How did we meet, Reggie? What do you mean, how did we meet? You know how we met. Yeah, but why were you there? To pay my respects, baby. What, what's with all the questions? I don't think you're telling the truth. So what am I lying about then, baby? Look, I need you to tell me the truth. Do you know anything about my father's death? Alicia... Listen... I'm listening... Do you love me? Do you love me? I think so. I... I guess so... Alicia, baby, you know... you know you mean more to me than anything in this world. You know I would never do anything to hurt you. You know that, right? I know. It's just that... some things... are just hard to explain. What things? Reggie, what are you talking about? I don't know. I... Baby, I gotta go. I ca--I gotta go. Reggie! Reggie! [phone beeps] [sirens] Hey, watch it young man. I just got out of the hosp-- Sorry about that, old man. That's all right. Thats all right. [knocking] Hey. What's the matter? Don't ask. What do you mean? This Packer. It doesn't make sense. The white guy from the mall is not the shooter. I mean, this idiot was locked up for a DUI at the time of the Packer murder. What about the other guy? Cooper. Well, I can connect Reggie with Joseph. I can even connect Joseph with Packer. But I can't connect either one of them to the scene of the crime. I need something else. How bout an eye witness? I'm not in the mood, Kline. Look, I gotta work this through. No, no. I'm, I'm not joking. What? I came in here to be a witness to a murder. Well, why now, Mr. Cody? Why didn't you come in sooner? I was in the hospital 'til the other day. Well... I'm glad you're feeling better. Why don't you tell us what you saw? I drove my car up to the grocery story. Now, on the way back, I usually go past the river, but the road was blocked off for construction. So, I went down to Main Street. You know, past Main Street? By the bank? I sees this man robbing this nice minister man. You know? The reverend, uh...uh... - Packer? - That's it. The reverend Parker. Now, I pull away fast 'cause I didn't know what would happen. I was going to hightail it all the way back home, but then I start to feeling bad. So I turned around and went back. But it was too late. Parker was on the ground... dead. Did you get a good look at his face? Yes, sir. I did. I never forgets me a face. It was Parker, all right. Saw his picture in the paper the very next day. No, sir. I meant the kid with the gun. Well, that's what I'm getting to. Mr. Cody, let me make this easier for you. Here. Is this the kid that you saw that night by the ATM? Hmm. Let me see here. That's all right, take your time. Nope. Don't know that I've seen that boy before. Mr. Cody, please, this is very important. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. Like I said, I never forgets me a face. Hmm. But I'm sure glad you got the other one. What other one? Well, the one that just left out of this office a few minutes ago. [Reverend Packer] June 14th. Alicia's 21st birthday. My wife prepared a nice dinner. I was surprised by an encounter with Joseph Brown. Didn't know he was out of prison. Benson Cooper and I gave information which led to Brown's prosecution. I know we did the right thing. Reggie... [car beeps] [knocking] Ricky, I gotta go. Somebody's at the door. Okay? Call me tonight, k baby? All right. Bye. [phone beeps] Oh, it's you. Goodbye, Joseph. [body thuds] I'll have a look for myself. [thunder] [Reggie] My dad always said, you can't run from who you are, from what you do. I've just been too angry, too stubborn to be paying attention. There was so many people I cared about. People who cared about me. I'd hurt them all too much already. There was only one move left. I understand. Only one thing left to do. [knocking] Reggie? Hello? Is anybody home? Oh my God! Tosha! Tosha? Tosha! Are you okay? What happened? Wake up? Oh my God. Don't leave her. I'll be right there. [phone beeps] Mama, what's wrong? Baby, I can't talk right now. I got to go. I'll call you when I can. - What's-- - It's Tosha. For the niggas who won't be here. [indistinct conversation] So... How do you want this to go down, boss? SWAT. I'll be there this time. Okay. Ma? Ma! Ma! Yo, Reggie. - Where you been, man? - What up man? What up? Where Ma at? What, you here by yourself? Where's everybody at? I don't know. Ma rushed out. Something about Tosha getting hurt or something. I don't know. Hurt? What are you talking about, hurt? I don't know, man. She rushed out of here. Mom said she was gonna call. Yo, man, I thought you was never coming back, yo. [scoffs] Of course I was coming back, man. Where's the phone? I need to make a phone call. I don't know. It's right over there. Let me get this room for a minute. All right, cool. [phone dialing] [phone ringing] Hudson here. Lieutenant, my name is Reggie Cooper. Cooper. Listen, we need to talk. Yeah, I know. It's all over. I'm turning myself in. Fine, good yeah. But there's something you need to know. What's that? It's about Joseph Brown. When's the last time you saw him? I don't know, it's been a while. Why? 'Cause we think he may have good reason to kill you. That's why. Bone? Yeah, Bone. Whatever you call him. Look. He might be coming for you. Hang up the phone. [Hudson] Cooper? [phone beeps] What the fuck are you doing, man? I'm handling my business. Something you ain't been doing lately. Now, go sit your bitch ass down. [dial tone] Sit the fuck down. Oh no, what, you gonna kill me, Bone? That's what this has come to? Hmm? You wanna kill me? You a snitch. I can't trust you no more. Snitch? Nigga, why would I snitch on you, man? I got more to lose than you. You know, I ain't never killed nobody who ain't deserve it. Right? I killed your father. What the fuck did you just say? I killed your father. Why the fuck would you do that? Because your father was a snitch. Like father, like son. So I just even the score. But I'm gonna give you a chance I didn't give your bitch-ass father, or mine. You didn't do that. You love your father? Why the fuck would you do that? I should kill you right now, you fuckin' piece of shit. Yeah, yeah. Pull the trigger. I loved my father. Pull the trigger, bitch. Squeeze it, bitch. Come on, squeeze it. [screams] Ahh, fucking kill you right here! [laughs] Send me to hell. Send me to hell. I won't do it again. [laughs] I'm not like you. It was that preacher, wasn't it? I knew it... it's just not for me, Bone. Well, hallelujah. You got religion all of a sudden. This ain't got nothing to do with religion. NIgga, I loved you like a brother. Huh uh. Taught me a lot of shit. Like a brother to me, my nigga. Huh uh. I loved you like a brother. I'd rather... I'd rather be feared than loved. But I don't fear you, Bone. What? I did what I did... for family. I'm your family. Loot was your family. Jamal was your family. The streets are your family. You do for us, we do for you. That's how it works, but you forgot that. You forgot where you come from. What did I forget, Bone? Where am I from, Bone? Yeah... Yeah. That's it. I decided I'm gonna turn myself in, tell them what I did, and I'm not gonna take you with me. [laughs] You got it twisted, son. It's not about what you did the night the preacher died. It's about what you didn't do. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? What makes you think... you could kill anybody. You don't even know how to use a damn gun. Don't move. Think you know me? Get on your knees! Get on your fucking knees. Lord... That shit ain't gonna save you now. I guess I'm supposed to be begging for my life, but you know what? If I go, that means this brother here... - ...he's in a lot of trouble. - Praying. Is there a way... Where's your god now, huh? ...for me to go if that's what's supposed to happen? It's in your hands. I don't know-- [gunshot] Sh-- I guess you finally caught up with me. You should have minded your own business. What makes you so... evil? Well, since I won't be going with you, tell that nigga Jesus I said what's up. [gunshots] [body thuds] Coop. Coop. Coop. Coop. Come on, man. We gotta get out of here. Let's roll. Oh, shit. Get the gun. I didn't do it? I had to kill him. You, you ain't cut out for this game. It don't matter now. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Make your peace with Jesus, Coop. Drop it. [laughing] Well, if it ain't little brother playing 5-0 again. I ain't playing, Joseph. Drop the gun! Well look, I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I can't do that, little man. I'm gonna have to call your bluff. Bone... please don't make me kill you. Yeah. He got nothing to do with this, Bone. Yeah, nigga. Yeah. See that, that's what I'm... that's what I'm talking about. Joseph! I will fucking blow your head off in here. Do you hear me? Please, don't make me kill you. I believe you would. I believe little man would kill me. Drop the gun. [gunshot, glass shattering] Vince! [gunshot] [glass shattering] Vince! Vince! You all right? Vince? I'm all right, I'm all right. [coughing] - Target's clear. - Let's go. Clear to enter the house. [coughing] One clear, two clear. [police scanner] That's cool, Coop. Life is hard. This is easy. You ever done something you truly regret, Lieutenant? What do you mean? I mean, like, if you could turn back the hands of time. Just for a minute, maybe an hour. You know, do some good for the one you love. No, I'd have to change more than an hour. I guess. The gun we took wasn't the gun that killed Packer. The ballistics don't match, but I guess you know that, don't you? We had an eye witness. He recalls seeing two men at the scene. He ID'ed the shooter, it was Brown. I don't imagine you know anything about the identity of the second man, do you? You don't owe him anything anymore. It's over. Take this opportunity and start over, okay? Thanks a lot, Lieutenant. We're not gonna meet this way again, right? No. So... what do you think? Did I do the right thing? By the way, I checked out what he asked me to. Yeah? Brown's gun... wasn't even loaded. What the hell do you make of that? How is she? She's all right. I'm sorry. For everything.
