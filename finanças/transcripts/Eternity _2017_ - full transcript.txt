Dear wife! Where are you? Come here! Wait for me! Please, give me a hand. OK. This is lovely, beautiful. Come closer, sea there. Phaxsi, my wife, let this be a sacred time. Willka, my husband, let this be a sacred time. Golden jewel, silver jewel... this is for you. Today is your wedding. Have strength and fill the corral with lot of lambs. Be always cheerful. Long live! Long live fertility! Hurrah! Hurrah! Today is Santo Romerito's Day. Hurrah! Long live fertility! Long live fertility! - Santo Romerito! - Hurray! Hurray! Long live! Let's celebrate. “Here is the golden offering. Here is the silver temple. Come back here, Romeritos. Come back here, spirits. Here is the golden offering. Here is the silver temple. "Come back here, Romeritos. Come back here, spirits." Willka, wake up. Dear, wake up. What's the matter? I want us to talk. I had a bad premonition. I think our son Antuku has forgotten about us. What was your dream about? I saw our son running naked, then he felt into a muddy river. Oh, no! That is a bad omen. Our son... he doesn't visit us anymore. He's gone for so long now. He must have forgotten us. If he comes.. I was thinking, what would I cook for him? Willka! Willka! He fell asleep again. Let's make porridge. - Grind some quinoa. - OK. - Today we will go the fields to make potato starch. - OK. Dear husband! Dear wife! Let's have lunch. I'm coming. I'm so tired. If our son Antuku would be here, he'd help us. I think he will never return. I think the big city has changed our son. One day he said: “Speaking Aymara is embarrassing”.He said that. How wrong things must be... that our own son has abandoned us. I hope the wind will bring him back home. - I think that is enough. - OK. I would like you to knit a new poncho for me. This poncho is so old. I'm too old... to knit your poncho. I can't see well anymore. I can hardly finish this blanket. It is too old, alright. Well, I will do my best to knit you a poncho. Thank you, you can do it. These fabrics are like us. The colors must be in harmony... so they can co-exist well. So, what color will be my new poncho? Dear, let's have some coca leaves. Phaxsi, wake up! Phaxsi, I'm right here. I think our son will come soon. I dreamed about it. My dreams usually come true. It's just a dream. And you never dream about our son? In ever recall my dreams. Tomorrow we'll go to the road and wait for him. I have a feeling he will come. Let's go to sleep. Turn off the lamp. It looks like our son will never arrive. What have we done wrong, for him to abandon us? He's left a long time ago... and maybe he thinks we already died. We still live, and we are waiting for him. Where will he be? He doesn't show up. The wind is gone again. - Have some rest. Come seat. - OK. Let's wait for the wind. My whole body aches. Youngsters should do this job. The elderly, we can't do it anymore. If we don't work, what are we going to eat? Mother Phaxsi, you know how to attract the wind. This young wind is so lazy. Young wind, come here! Miss frost is here! She says she loves you a lot! Come back here strong! Come dancing and blowing! It worked, it heard you. It's coming now, look. - Dear, eat this. - OK. Alright, alright. Tomorrow... is Pachakuti's Day. We will go the sacred mountain. Yes. I'm tired. Dear wife, the day has arrived again... and it's a sacred day. Let's go fast. Today is the beginning of a new year. Sun god is moving fast. Holy Mother Earth, holy mountains and ancestors, for this year that is ending, we offer you this as a token of gratitude. Likewise, as we begin this new year, we ask you for our wellness, for our live stock and our crops. Please, take care of our son. We also ask you to make our son comes back. Tell our fortune, pick a message for this year. Oh! What's the matter? It says a misfortune will happen this year. Besides, death is around us. I don't want to go yet, I wish to see my son again. We are running out of matches. The town is too far. You will have to go to buy matches. There's a leak? Yes, it is dripping. What you said? It's dripping, I felt it in my hand. There must be a hole in the roof. Hand me a plate, so it will drip there. Good, good. Let it drip there. Oh dear god! Protect us from this bad augury. I'm tired. I'm so tired. It looks like it will keep raining. - Get the stairs ready. - OK. I'm coming. Rain, go away! Phaxsi! Give me that bunch of straw! Pull it carefully. Hurry up, before the sun sets, cover the hole. Little Wawa! Come here! Watch the sheeps, be careful with the fox. Tomorrow you must go to the town... to buy matches. But it's too far. Besides, I'm afraid of travelling. Maybe I can't even go back. You are still strong. You will come back. - Don't forget the matches. - OK. Matches, matches, matches. Matches, matches, matches. Matches, matches, matches. Come back soon. Yes. Off I go. Big Apacheta, I'm tired. I'm so exhausted. I'm tired. Big Apacheta, help me finish my journey. Wawa! Where are you, Wawa?! Willka! Where are you? Willka! Willka! Where are you? Willka! Phaxsi! Help me! Willka! Where are you?! Wilka! Phaxsi! Help me! What happened? I can not get up. - I brought you food. Eat this. - Thank you. Dear, wake up. Dear, wake up. You didn't make it to the town? This is a disgrace, it is not right. What are we going to do now? We ran out of matches. We'll keep the ember burning. So we will take good care of the fire. This is not right. It has snowed a lot... What is this? Wawa! Where are you? Where hast his dog gone? He's lost. Willka! Willka! All my sheeps have been devoured. Look, this baby died too. My babies! Dear wife, the fox has eaten all. My babies! My babies! My poor babies! This can't be. My livestock. They were so lovely. Why?! Why?! Oh, my sheeps! My romerito... I lost all my animals. Start the fire carefully. We have to take good care of this fire... I wish it never goes out. I made you this medicine. Please, hurry up. I have chills. My dear, you're the last son we have left. “Condor from the high summits, when will you come back? Condor from the high summits, when will you come back? I'm too old now, I want to fly far away. Condor from the high summits, when will you come back?” Where will it be? I lost it, where could it be? I lost it. Phaxsi! Where are you? Here it is, I found it. I was calling for you. What are you looking for? Coca leaves. I'm hungry. Look, I found it. I hope there's something left. No! There's nothing here. What will I do? What are we going to eat? There's nothing left. Don't worry, we will be fine. Dear wife, wake up. I'm sleepy. It is late, sleep then. Wait. For tomorrow, I will save this fire... with the ember burning. Wife! Wake up! - My skirt! - Getup, quickly, we must escape from this house. Fire! Fire! Hurry up... or we'll be caught by the fire! The house is on fire! My house is burning! Throw some water! Oh my god! - What sin have we done? - Help us! God, help me! Help!! We lost it! We lost it all! God, where are you?! My God, help us! Dear, wake up. Look, we lost everything in the fire. Are you sick? I'm cold. Despite all, we're together. We will be OK. If our son Antuku would be here, he'd help us. Shut up. Our son will never come. Alqamari, bad omen! Why are you coming to cry in my house? Light up that lamp. I'm afraid to handle the fire. Because of me... the house went on fire. Don't blame yourself, let it go. Calm down, I'll make you some medicine. Please, hurry. Drink this, - it will heal you. - Thank you. Did you hear the crying? What is it? The gods are crying. Will you leave me too? And now, what will you cook? I don't know. All we had, it burned with the house. What if we kill the lama? No! It's the only thing we have left. What will we eat, then? How much longer will we survive? Dear son, don't be scared. My god! What have we done to you... to fall from grace like this! What have you done? Answer me! You said you were hungry. Don't cry, we will be OK. Please, don't cry. Willka. Willka. Talk to me, say something. Don't go to sleep, food is almost ready. Willka. Willka, let's eat. Willka. Willka, talk to me! What is happening to you?! Phaxsi. Phax... Dear, you're strong. No, don't give up. - Water... water... - Wait. Here's the water. Please, drink it. Willka, Willka... don't go. Don't leave me. Listen to me! I'll knit a white poncho for you. Willka, Willka. Please, don't leave me. You said you will never leave me, what happened?! Please, wake up! Willka! Willka! Dearests, take care of our son Antuku.
