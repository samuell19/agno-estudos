Video Running Time 02:27:20 Google search name - Tarana You can't run away form problems and pains. They follow you wherever you go. My car was going very fast on the road, But I knew it can't save me from self-created destruction. You're strange Moti. You're not yet ready for wedding tonight. - I'm just leaving. - Let me congratulate you. This present is from all of us. We wish your married life to be as colorful as these flowers. I don't want your present. Marriages take place everyday - it is not a new thing. Go and do your work. - What's happened to him. - It is his marriage today. - Something is wrong in marriage. - Let's go back to our work. Please wait. I beg your pardon. And thank you for the flowers. Patient is ready for surgery. My hands were shaking. There was darkness before my eyes. My patient was unconscious. His life and death was in my hands. But how a drowning man can support another person. I tried to get hold on myself. Tonight I will get married - with a girl I can never love. I can never make her happy. My father will be happy as as his burden will be lightened But Tarana's soul will be smiling. She knows I can't forget her as much as I may try. I'm exhausted. I can't think. I can't run away from all this. She was a very crazy girl. I remember clearly... I was returning from abroad after getting my MD degree. After many years I saw the earth of my country. My heart danced at seeing those wide spread jungles hiding many a small villages... It didn't know their beauty will arrest me. And these villages will make me their own forever.

People come and go - but they leave their memories in hearts. If I get an opportunity I will come to see you. Yes, but who knows how long I'll hold life in my old body. But you're like a god who is working to save other lives. But I had desire to see this god with my own eyes. If you were not blind by birth your sight could be restored. I'm not blind by birth -I lost my sight seven years ago. - You are not blind by birth! - No. I don't guarantee, but I hope your sight can be restored. - My sight can be restored. - Yes I hope so. Tarana, doctor sahib says my sight can be restored. - What' re you saying papa? - He said he'll restore my sight I'll see beauty of nature. I'll see you my kid! - Will papa see again? - Yes, I do hope so. You'll really restore his sight - I'll try - rest is up to God. - You're giving him false hope? - No, you stupid girl. When will you restore his eyes? Tell me when? After I return. - Where are you going? - Going to city. - When? - I'm going today. Why did you hid it from me until now? Tell me, why... I knew when you hear this you will be angry with me. Why are your eyes still turning red? Liar... thief... I'll come back in a month or two - why don't you understand? I too have a home, my father - I'm returning after 7 years... I don't trust your words... you're lying... I'm lying? Yes. I found out from your talk - you didn't tell me anything You've been deceiving me for so many days - you're scoundrel - You're bent on insulting me... - Yes, what'll you do... - I'll slap you... - I dare you... You're leaving me and also slapping me. - I just gave one slap. - Give me 10, and stay here. - What will you get if I stay. - You want me to say openly... - Yes... - What! No, I won't say any such thing. - What have you done to me? - I've put a spell on you. - Praise makes you happy! - Yes. You will forget me after going there? - You won't forget me Moti... - It's possible. - You have never seen the city... - No. In the hustle of city how can I remember where or who I had met - I might not remember your name. - Moti! Never do that. When you stop loving, just poison me. Hey! You think I will ever forget you. Look here. You know. I'll remember you in quiet of night when city sleeps I'll ask you to go, let me sleep but you'll persist there. - Stay one more day Moti. - What's use of one more day? I'll have to go next day. Won't you come to see me off? - No. I won't see you off. - I'll come to receive you. [You have never seen the city] [After going there how can I remember where or who I had met I might not remember your name. My beloved has left me unhappy Whose bad spell is upon me. How did you come back? Perhaps because I couldn't go. Nobody stopped you. Yes, you're right - nobody stopped me. But I remember someone standing on hill with tears in her eyes. A shivering hand waved at me - then all went dark in my eyes. I can't remember what happened thereafter. You feel so much yet you were so proud to accept my request. Go, I've no concern with you - No concern! Yes, none at all. - Should I go? - Yes... you go away - Okay return my thing. - What did you give me? I gave you my heart. Return it. - Heart? - Yes, return my heart. I had given it to you. You throw your things and blame me for stealing them. Will your father be angry with you? No. I've explained everything to mother. Very clever! - Namastte, how can I help you? - Moti's father...? Yes, I'm his father. I have a letter from your son. - Please have a seat. - Thakur, please read... - Dear dad, meet the mom. - Why did Moti send her here? He writes, papa's eyes will be operated. I've not got rid of this mom - now where has papa come from? I'm sending a list of medicine and instrument - take this. Please buy and send these immediately. Neither I want to hear letter nor meet her. Turn them out. - Should I write you won't send? - Yes write whatever you like. Why are you shouting, If you don't send I'll send. Give me. Mother has sent so many things. What does she write in letter? I'm sending some clothes for Tarana with other materials. How do I look? - Very bad. - What else has mom written? The way you left me I doubt you will find another excuse to stay there after father's eye surgery. This city has no better girl to offer you than Tarana. Her eyes, beautiful nose, pink lips I've not seen in the world Give my abundance love. Mom has sent abundance love. Do you want to take? You have added them on your own Have I been bitten by a mad dog that I'll praise you so much. You certainly have been bitten by a mad dog. What happened? Mom has sent material for your eye surgery Eyes... material for restoring my eyes... - Will I be able to see again? - Tell us Moti Babu. Our duty is to make an effort - success is in God's hands. God... God can give everything. He isn't the God's devotee? A man who can give sight can also put life in a dead body. And one who puts life in dead is like a God. What do you say... - I say this is impossible. - But he seems knowledgeable. - Who can challenge God's will. - But he will get his sight. - What if he can't see? - What if he can see? - I'll shave off my moustache. - So let's all agree... Defeated person's moustache will be shaved and paraded in every village street with black face on a donkey. - How are you now. - I am okay. But when I imagine about seeing you, seeing Tarana... my heart jumps in happiness. But then I tell my mad heart... don't hold too much hope - what if sight is not restored! When will you remove dressing? You don't tell anything. - It'll be removed today. - Will it be removed today! - Right now. - Right now! Can Surdas see anything now? When his dressing is removed my father will also see. It's just a pretext. Outsider is taking advantage of you. - What do you mean? - I've always warned you they sow thorns of sadness in the village of happiness. After all how a man can give sight that God has taken away. Shut up. I'll shut up but you will have to weep someday. With the removal of dressing outsider's secret will be out. I can see you. I got my eyes. I can see my daughter. Can't you hear, I've been calling you so loudly. - I don't want to talk to you. - But why are you weeping? You wanted to go for sight seeing. I even borrowed the cart. But you don't want to go today. What's the harm in going tomorrow. Tomorrow papa is returning - will we have time. Did you ask why I don't want to go today. I don't want to ask or talk with you any more. You boss over me, Tarana do this, Tarana do that... I do everything for you with or saying. I shine your shoes I clean your dirty laundry - and you never even thank me. Just for this of small matter - it's not small matter. You go away from here You're very bad. - Okay, let's go right now. - Let's go right now. - Why did you take this pill? - I was hungry so I ate a pill. What else can I do? Since I've come here you fight with me. I don't get anything to eat. So I eat these tablets. You gave this to mom in fever. You've fever, you're so hot. It's hot because you touched it I don't have any fever. No, it is fever - No, it's not. - I'm so bad. - Of course you are. I fought with you so much. Have rest, will go another time No rest now. We'll go, we'll go today and we'll go right now. - Your fever will worsen. - I don't care, you'll go. - No, I won't go. - You'll not go? Oh, he has picked her up. Worse may come on you outsider... Well outsider, you dare so much I'll punish you for this. Put a hand on my heart. Its each beat challenges your power - Guru says have patience. - How can I be patient. I'm eager to hold her hand and outsider picks her in his arms. Guru, don't delay, bless him - he adds Rs.15 in your wealth. Another Rs.15. Okay take this but bless me, suggest remedy. Take Guru's blessings and inform the Surdas. Father is gone to holy places and daughter for unholy games. My coming to you clandestinely Remember it, never forget. Hey - - What? - Come on... - No. Then go. Come here Moti. What's wrong with you? - What happened Moti? - Nothing. Felt dizzy. There is a shelter nearby come, you can rest there. Who can tolerate his behavior. Girls are respected in village We won't let outsider scar the esteem of this village. - Why are these clouds bursting? - Perhaps they are angry. - Clouds also become angry. - Yes, why not. Then they burst and cause lightening to burn their homes. - Will lightening fall today. - Can't say. It can fall on us. We've not sinned. Lightening falls on sinners. Lightening is falling on my heart too. You can ignore such behavior villagers can't tolerate it. If you got eyes by losing respect then poke these eyes. What use of those eyes which can't be raised in public. When you were blind they were meeting in secret - Now he openly carries her in his lap. I don't lie. I've seen him carrying your daughter. You saw. With your own eyes. The what did you do? Instead of giving this news if you had prepared their pyre and said you're waiting for me, I would have said put oil on the pyre and burn them alive. This night's for being together and for becoming immortal. Only if time will stop here - with lightening and clouds... and night covering our life - - What'll happen then? I'll then spend rest of my life in your maddening eyes. And when death comes I'll put my head in your lap and sleep. No. God please do not keep me alive after Moti. Let me die before Moti my God. Very often I feel you're smaller than me. As if you'll fall somewhere - will be lost without me Whenever you're away from me, I become fearful - something has happened to you and I start praying for your safety. - You are madly in love. - You too are madly in love. Rain has stopped. There'll be no cloud bursting or lightening I stopped them. I asked them to be quiet. My Moti is not well. He'll sleep. You've control over all these things. Close your eyes. I've closed them. - Now sleep. - I'm asleep. Deceitful. Sleep quietly otherwise Night will run away." Somebody is coming Moti! - Papa! - Move away... We don't kill guests. Go away. Before villagers kill you I say go away from here. Go. He's guest. Papa said don't kill guests. You may go sir. It's very difficult. My sons actions often cause troubles. Patience will bear fruit. After you meet him you'll be happy. I can see some shelters ahead - we can rest there. Who' re you? Your servant-dust of your feet. I woke days and nights... to see you awake and bring light in my life. On this moonless night you have made my life as full moon night What are you saying? You'll die? What's all this? How did I come home? Where's Tarana? Tarana? Who's Tarana? My Tarana. They wanted to snatch her from me. Where's she I'm your Tarana. Recognize me. Look into my eyes. - You're Tarana? - Yes. I'm your Tarana. No. You're not Tarana. You're lying. They took her. Where did they took her? Why don't you tell? Then hear. Tarana left you. Perhaps her game was over. Perhaps she was bored. I brought your dead body. I put a new life in your body. You'll not take her name now. You'll forget her from heart. One more word and I'll take off your tongue. Go away from here. I'm going to her. She's waiting for me. Tarana. Where' re you Tarana. I can't see anything. Beat me, how much more you can. Don't your hands tire out? Wish you had died on birth - I would not have seen this day. I tremble to see hate in people's eyes. As if they say - there goes the shameless man carrying disgrace on his soul. Sin? What's my sin? Tell me papa what's my sin? Whole village saw him sleeping in your lap and you're asking what's your sin. A man in high fever falls in rain. He can't walk two steps. If giving him support is sin - then I've committed a sin. Shut up. Don't try to trick me Even tonight you were taking that bastard's name in sleep. Don't abuse him papa, he's not bad. You'd said he is a god. Why did you say? You said he's god. I accepted him as my god. As long as I'm alive I'll say Moti was god, yes he's god. Who took a false blame. Whose wounds will always cry. - Where' re you going postman? - Delivering a letter to Tarana - Give it to me, I'll deliver. - Much obliged. A letter from city! There is something cooking. Outsider is sick. He'll come to marry Tarana after he's well If Tarana marries outsider, all will taunt and laugh at me. Take Gurus permission and go to Surdas. Beg for Tarana's hand. Don't miss this opportunity. Bless him Guru, he gives Rs.15. - I've given Rs.15 many times. - Give one more time. I'll give you right now... Take it. Every time Rs.15 You've made your Guru very greedy. Your money is going? I'm taking back my own money. People are spreading rumors and taunting me. Marry Tarana to me Marry her to you - who lied and made me insult a god like man... who instigated me to beat my innocent daughter. Go away otherwise I'll throw you out. Wise people say think twice before you say anything. Shut up you dog. By raising your hand on me you have raised it on your fate. - Have you understood Ganeshi? - I'm a nurse I can't do that. I'll give Rs.200 which is more than you get helping 50 births. Keep Rs.10 advance. Spread this rumor throughout the village. - She's shamed the whole village. - Who? Tarana? What happened? O God! She should have died. - Here she comes! - Who? Tarana? Let's go. Why are you evading me. Don't touch me, otherwise I'll have to clean my water pitcher. Why will you clean again? Won't you tell me? - You tell her... - Tell me, why you all hate me? Nurse mom said that you - What has she said? What have I done? You don't want to tell me. Okay... - I'll ask nurse mom myself. - Better don't go to her. All doors of the village are closed on you. What happened my kid. Tell me. They avoid my shadow, they hate me. Tell me why they do that. Why do they stop me from going to the riverbank. Does running water, air, earth belong to them. They cover their clean utensils when they see me. I'm being treated the same. I too burn in this hell fire. Before this people used to greet me respectfully. Now I go as though a dog passed from here to there. What's the reason? What's our crime? Tell me papa. I've accepted Sheila as my daughter-in-law. You'll have to marry her. My heart will break in pieces without Tarana. Tarana is dead. It was a momentary craze. Forget her. But don't forget who you are what's your duty. Take back my youth Oh giver of youth." Hate in eyes, hate on lips - turning face on seeing us... hiding cleaned utensils from my daughter's shadow... You've treated me and my daughter like you treat dogs. But I say you are dogs... She is lucky to have found a god like outsider. Their love is like love of Lord Shiva and Parvati. Their love is purer than the brightness of sun. Very pure love. If it wasn't pure I would have killed her myself. These hands can protect her but can also choke her if impure. So choke her Surdas. She can't live with our daughters. I'm in favor of her love. Do whatever wrong you can. What more can be wronged, there is nothing left. What will she say. Can you throw dust on moon. Say auntie, why are you afraid. - Say, what do you want to say. - I'm nurse. - I know that. - Tarana is pregnant. You can't see anything except the dark. But I can see a spark of light in the darkness. If you agree. Tarana will marry with fire. Death will sing welcome songs. Look Moti, we are getting married. Save Tarana from burning. Go away otherwise I will throw you in the fire. - This your madness Surdas. - Go away... Anyone stepping forward will see this consequence. Go away. Don't be stupid Tarana - Moti is alive. I'm not lying. See this letter. I don't want to die. I want to go to my Moti. What's going on here? Where's Tarana. Don't you see her marriage pyre This land can't bear the burden of an unwed mother. Also it can't bear the burden of sinner like you. Outsider is innocent. I bribed the nurse to spread this rumor. Forgive me. You're telling after she has been silenced. There is only me and My sorrowful evening" My life without you is A blame on my life." See Moti, papa has also left me. And I'm still alive. Fire could not burn me. But you'll never be able to forget her. Her crazy soul will be all over you but you won't see her. She will be weeping for you but you won't feel her. Her hands will console you but you won't feel them. But you can make her soul happy. - How? - By remaining alive. You're a doctor Moti. Thousands of dying people need your help. You can give them life and the smiles which they've lost. Your own wounds will be uncured but you can cure their sores. Why should I do that? And for whom? Do it for Tarana. Do it for her soul. Do it for Tarana. Do it for your soul. Soup for you uncle. - My daughter looks like a bride. - Why do you such things? - How did Moti agree? - How do I know? He's a foolish boy. I thought there is nothing left in my life except frustration. But today I see a ray of hope in this darkness. And that's you. You can remove this darkness from my life. You've given him new life. You can make him forget Tarana. Time is a great healer. I don't need to remove her memories. Tickets for you sir. What's the matter Moti. - Going to picture. - I can see that. But who's the other ticket for? It's for a girl. For a girl? Did you hear Kitty? At last Dr. Moti has forgotten his first love! Forgotten his first love! Forgotten his first love! You seem tired. Why, what happened? Avoice keep echoing. I don't know what's happening to me. Have some sleep - you'll be okay. Yes, I better sleep. Give me a couple of sleeping pills. My beloved has abandoned me Which evil eyes has affected me Who are you? How did you come in? - He's sleeping so peacefully! - Have you anything to say him? He is asleep, What will he hear of me? You can see him in hospital tomorrow. He usually doesn't see anybody in home. Who is he to you. I'm too shy to say it. So he loves you too much? He can't live without me. But why you're asking all this? Because some day some one had loved me that much. I too believed that he can't live without me. - But he went leaving me alone. - Where did he go? How can I tell you where he went? If I tell you my story - your heart too will break. Your eyes will shed tears of blood. So I'll not tell you anything. Why should I burn you in my fire. It's not your fault. Wait... You didn't come. See... I've come to you. How discourteous are you Moti? You didn't even welcome me. - Take these ten rupees. - No, I don't want money. - Keep these, you may need them. - No. - Would you give me this goat. - What'll you do of it stupid. I will tell my problems with this dumb one. Will you give? Tell him a stupid girl took her. Okay take her. But take good care of her. Sainyan...! What a beautiful name! Sainyan...! Who had come here Sheila? I felt she was here. She wanted to say something to me. Dead people don't come like this. Then why do I often wake from sleep? Why do I feel she is searching me around here. I wish she would come. If it's up to me I'd rather go there and send her here. If you go I'll be very lonely - I'll be totally alone. Problem is both situations are very difficult. Sir, master wants to see you. - What does he want to say. - Can't say. - You come with me Sheila. - No, you go. I've no complaint against you. I'm crying for unlucky Sheila. When I see her I remember a torn-feathered peacock. Papa, there is no way to repay her kind help. She has given a new life to drowned man. What have you done? You give her hope and then withdraw it. I've done no such thing. She was so excited to go out with you this morning. But you disappointed her. I knowl should expect nothing from you, but being a father... I think you might show some mercy on her. Anyway, go my son. An old man's emotions can make you unhappy. Go. Do whatever you like. Go wherever you can have peace. Don't worry about me. I'll spend my days somehow. Papa... - After all what had happened? - He's very sad because of me. - What does he want? - He wants me to... He wants I should marry you. What did you say? What could have I said...? What you would have said? Answer, why don't you say? If I was in your place I would have willingly given my life for the happiness of my dying father. And now may I ask what you are going to do? Now why don't you answer? I'll do no such thing. Go and tell him Moti can't sacrifice... that he doesn't have courage... that he'll go away from here... that he can't see his father dying before his own eyes. Go... why are you still here looking at my face. Go. Wait Sheila... I can't give you anything in life. I don't have nothing to offer. I can't even love you. I know your life with me will be an unhappy life. I ask you - will you marry me knowing all this? Will you? I will - if you so desire. [It's possible I might forget you after going to city.] [In city's hustle, I may forget where I'd gone, or who I'd met] [Perhaps I may not even remember your name.] [So don't mind if I pass by you without recognizing you.] [Don't mind.] Will touching feet of gods and goddesses rid life's problems. Problems may or may not be solved, but this brings peace. So you've come here for peace. I've come to get blessings for beginning of new life. What do you mean by new life. Don't you remember Moti - we're getting married tonight. Yes I remember we're getting married tonight. What would you get by marrying me. I'll get a god at whose feet I'll spend all my life. You' II cheat yourself knowingly. It's a matter of devotion. You can't see yourself with my eyes Whenever my eyes see you - they see a god in you. I wish my eyes had this quality So that wherever you turn your eyes you will see Tarana. Isn't it true? It's true Sheila. You can see her in me. This same Sheila can become Tarana in your eyes. Do you hear, this Sheila can become Tarana in your eyes. What' re you saying Sheila? In depth of my eyes you can see the eyes you're so keen to see. I was waiting for this moment. I got you today Moti. From now onwards you're mine. No worldly power can separate me from you. - No power can separate us. - Sheila... I lost - Tarana won. But no body was at fault. It was written in my fate - nobody can change or wipe it. What a forgetful man you are! Do you know how late you are? Come soon - auspicious moment is about to pass over. I'm coming soon. - Bridegroom has come Jamuna. - Really, let's get Rs.100... Moti Babu you can't enter without giving Rs.100 to us... He is liar my God. You're my witness. He lied to me. He betrayed me God. The way he has taken my peace - You deprive him of peace God. You can throw pieces of his picture... but you can't remove his memory from your heart. Can you? Can you Tarana? No I can't forget you Moti... I can't Respected father. I know I'm causing shock to your heart... but I've no option. You were trying to spring in the garden of my life... but it's not in my control. Forgive me if you can. Don't try to search me. I'm going far away from you. You're still alive? No... you don't come near me. - Don't come near me. - Why shouldn't I come near you I know you belong to someone else. You go away from here Moti - I don't need you. Stupid! I was under the impression you had left me. Don't lie any more Moti - I'm already very troubled. Leave me alone. Move away your hands. Tarana... Tarana is dead. I hate you. You're a liar - you cheated me. Leave me. You leave me Moti. Hear me or I'll choke your neck - Choke me, choke my neck. Listen, you've not allowed me to have a moment of peace. Enough is enough. Understand? Luckily my craze has brought me here - otherwise I would have been married to that girl. You're not married to that girl - No Tarana. - You're lying. - I'm telling the truth. Okay leave my hear. And see you'll have to stop the use of abusive language. - Won't you stop? - Yes - I'll stop.
