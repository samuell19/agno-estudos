ALL THAT DIVIDES US Go that way. There. Tito. Get going! Hey! We fucked him good! He almost ripped his arm off! Can't fuck with him. Good boy, Tito. Little Tito. Turn it up. I'll call the sitter. What sitter? You have a sitter? Yeah. To sit on whose dope? What is this shit? Ben, I'm talking to you! What the hell's going on? Explain. - Karim, forget the phone! - Take it easy. It's cool. Nothing to say? What if he finds out? Dumbfuck! Daniel won't think it's us. Even the kids know where his stash is. But they aren't reaming him. This business stinks. Why the hell are you using a sitter? How long you been gouging him? Dunno, like two months. Two months? So where's the cash? It goes fast. Threads, a chick here and there... You gotta be kidding. And his new wheels. - A piece of shit! - Whaddya mean? What'd you pay for it? Well? We gotta sell off the rest. The sitter better shut her trap. You'll see, she rocks. Don't give a shit. What's her name? Dunno. Can't pronounce it. What's up? What clowns! I cut, you weigh? Move! What's going on? On the floor! Don't move! Little bitches! Am I a supermarket? How long were you gonna stiff me? Didn't you say you quit working for me? Where's the rest of the stuff? What rest? Didn't think I'd notice? Look, we sold some. How much? - Just a little. - My ass! I'm missing 30,000 worth! Look, we fucked up. We'll work it out. Can we work it out? I want my dough. Shit, Daniel! I want my cash! Go to the cops, and it's the swamp! Get your bitches outta here. Get 'em out! Fucking shit! My hand, man! Sonofabitch! Come on. Move, dammit! I told you we were fucked. Why didn't you tell me? She won't throw you out? Got any better ideas to fix this? How could you fuck up so bad? - What's going on? - Nothing. I'll explain. - What's the matter? - Stop. - Is she home? - Yes. Tell me what's up. You're stressing me out. Here. Don't overdo. Come on, share. Would you see me if I didn't get you high? I think so. You have other qualities. Does it hurt? Yes. What're you doing? I need 3 or 4 grand. That much? Who are these guys? Shut up! You don't know 'em. Tell me what the money's for. It doesn't grow on trees. I know, thanks! You don't know them! Will you help me? Yes or no? Either help, and you save me, or I'll kill myself. Got that? I'll kill myself. That what you want? Are you nuts? I swear I will. Will you help me or not? Stop, Rodolphe! I swear I will. I'll help you. Just stop. Shit, look at your hand. What is this game? It's no game. Think I'm joking? I'm fucked, I tell you. I'm fucked. I'm fucked. What's she doing here? Want a drink? Stop seeing my daughter. Can't she decide? She's no kid. - I'm still her mother. - What the fuck do I care? At least I don't bore her. She gets out, has fun. "The real life"! Wonderful. We may even get married. To keep fleecing us? The bank called. Shut up, Granny! How dare you! I'm not your bitch. Came to lecture me? And your husband's port schemes? Your Kraut wasn't so clean, so don't bust my balls! I wish he were here to slug you. Can you believe her? Be right back. This isn't your office. Lay off! You're up front, so am I. Julia loves me. She's hooked. So she helps me out. What'll I do without her? Is it so important to you? Yes, very. Enough to talk money? A fine proof of love! 30,000 and I disappear. No money, I stay. So play fucking Santa Claus or beat it. So is that it? Or how about a drink, a smoke? Right, get lost. - So how much? - 3,000. 4,000 to the death. - 5,000, ok? - Ok. - You serious? - Got a better idea? It'll go fine. Ok, boy. Go! Get him! Go for the throat, Tito! Don't let up! Kill him! I see what cash you give him. So? He needs help. I need him. He wants money to stop seeing you. Think I'm surprised? What do you see in him? Find better than this guy who... I find guys who like fucking cripples! You're not a cripple! I hate it when you say that. Well, I hate this leg. And what that accident did to me! Give me a drag. Did you have to tell him Dad did time? Why? You ashamed? No. But I don't see the need. Say you'll stop seeing him. Promise me. Never promise, never disappoint. - Here. - I don't want it. Now listen. Mom, stop it. Wrap him in this if you want. Go away, please. What a ball breaker she is! At first I thought she was my ticket outta here. But she's crazier than I am. Oh yeah? You okay? Without Tito, how'll we make money? Dunno. He'll hassle us until we pay up. Fucker! We could pull a heist. Are you serious? I'll do it if we have to. Are you nuts? A heist! What a clown! So, guys, what do we do? Sell your lousy crate. You, the shit you bought. Your clown duds, TV... You kidding? Do I look like it? I ain't selling my threads. I said, sell it all! Lay off, Rodolphe! 30,000 euros! You really fucked me up! It's them or us! Get that through your head. Fuck! Cut it out. What's with you guys? Fuck. - C'mon, I'm kidding. - You pain. Don't be such a priss. I'm taking a dip. You coming? I'm game! Coming, Ben? Move your ass. You bastard! Cut it out! Get your ass in here. Come on, Ben! Let me by. Rod who? Get lost! Fuck! I don't believe it! Gimme your keys, I'll take her home. Wait at home. Hey, guys! - You know her? - Yeah, I do. Don't bring dopeheads to the 'hood. Shut your ass, guys. Stuff it. What're you doing here? You don't call back. Think I have time? And your mother pissed me off. Come on. To hell with her. Stop it. Not here! You're totally stoned. Here. - I found 300 euros at home. - That all? Mom told the bank I was incompetent. I can't get more. But I'll figure it out, I swear. Stop, I said. I'll take you home. And cover up. I'm a little zonked. Did we smoke a lot? You especially. Did you take all those meds? They ease the pain. Lay off. Right. Any excuse will do. Here. Stop. Not now. Your mouth says one thing, your dick says the opposite. I want you. Wait. You drive me wild. Fucking shit. What? Look. Shit. What an idiot! Why'd I say I'd take you home? Walk, it's not far. I'll deal with it. I'll help you. With that bum leg, you'll help change a tire? As usual, right? We fuck, you get your dough, I get my dope. It suited you until now. You want more? Think you're irreplaceable? You're good for my prostate. I can have any chick. Look into my eyes. You see love there? You see love? Think you're so hot? You're frigid! I gotta work my dick off. Go on, beat it. Get outta here! - Are you nuts? - Shut up! Fuck you! I don't believe it! Quit laughing. Serves you right. - Look at you. - Quit it. Quit laughing or I'll kill you. Beat it, you worthless bitch! - Shut up! - Get lost! Stop! You serious? Want me to slug you? Try it. - Go on, hit me. - You'd like that. Shut your mouth. You're pissing me off. I'm gonna rip you to pieces! Shut up! Following me like a dog. "Rodolphe..." Nothing but trouble. Shut up! I can't stand you! - Goddammit! - Shut up! Fuck... You ok? Oh shit. Let me see. Hang on. Look at me. I love you. Forgive me. Look at me. Look at me. I'm sorry. Are you ok? Look at me, I said. You ok? I love you. Forgive me. Stay. Stay with me. Stay with me! Shit. Fuck. Mom? What is it? Now what'd you take? Look at you. Say something! What? I don't know what I've done. It's Rodolphe. What? Did he... Did you fight? Did he hurt you? I don't know what I did. I hit him. What? - He went crazy. - What'd you do? I'm in deep shit. Did anyone see you? Did you see any other cars? I don't think so. Don't "think." Be specific! No, no other cars. Are you sure? Yes. Shit. I'm screwed. I'm screwed. - We need to call the cops. - Quiet. What're you doing? Nothing. Be quiet. Help me, dammit! Here we go. Wait. Give it to me. Here. There, got it. Wait. Don't move. Are you ok? That scared me. You ok? That scared me. - Will you be alright? - I'm cold. Wake up. Your meds. If you have anything of that guy's, get rid of it. You hear me? Your phone. Your phone! What if the cops ask questions? I don't know. We'll see. Strip your bed. Tracking... Rodolphe's voicemail. Leave a message. You gone fishing or what? Are you serious? Bring my wheels back! What's with you? They found Rodolphe's body. On a local beach, a man was found murdered. He is Rodolphe Calavera, thirtyish, with a police record for petty crime. So far the investigation suggests a local gang dispute. Was he a friend? If you can call a dealer a friend, yes. Did you see him at other times? I don't see merchants except for business. Was he pushy when you owed him money? More and more, yes. What if they know he brought you here? Don't answer that! Remember, it's up to the police. They must prove you saw each other. So I say I didn't see him, that I've no idea what could have happened, and why are they asking. Right? That's it. Try to be more convincing. - Mom... - Listen! They have no proof, no witnesses. They have nothing. Nothing! Ok, let's start over. So... What a heartbeat! Is it me? It's nothing. I don't know what you've heard, but I didn't do Rodolphe. Don't whine to the cops. Think we're squealers? The cops know nothing. They came by. And? They don't give a shit. So who did Rodolphe? - Do you know? - No, I don't. I just want my dough. 30 grand is hard to get. I put clothes on you. I can strip you. Nice. You want "nice"? Find another job. Sell teddy bears or candy. That's nice. Ok, got it. Mom! The cops! It's Olivier. I know why. - Want some coffee? - That sounds good. How do you feel? Better. Much better. Thanks. Sorry to have bothered you about the stolen ring. I should have told you I found it. Good. You sounded so upset on the phone. I didn't want to worry you. Anyway, who would take it? No one comes out here. Then we drop it? Yes. This house is too big. I misplace things. I'll be going. Thanks for the coffee. 'Bye, Louise. Proud of yourself? Ben. What's going on? What's with you? And you scared the kid. The site would enable you to dispatch larger ships. Like what your husband had in Hamburg. Still, a land purchase that size is a costly operation. Competition is stiff. He's right. Mr. Keller would have agreed. The contracts. They must go out tomorrow. Yes, Julia. No, I'm sorry. Mom, come home. Why? Come home quick. Are you alright? Sorry, I have to leave. Who are you? Rodolphe's friend. The jerk took my car. Your car's not here. That's just it. It's nearby. I was telling your daughter, I tracked it in case it got stolen. Don't freak out. No one saw me come here. What are you doing? Calling the police, of course. You can't do that. Rodolphe bummed money off you. His "goose with the golden eggs"! A good reason to whack him. Now he can't bother you. I'm not involved. - The police'll believe me. - Then try 'em. You, call them. They'll be all ears. Others saw you together. Like those kids bugging you. And what's my car doing here? Explain that. I've already been questioned. What'd you say? I don't do the police's job. What do you want? 30,000. And I'll keep quiet. Is that what Rodolphe's worth? Shut up, I swear! I want part of it Thursday. Or you'll do 20 years. An old service station before the toll. Be there at 11 or it's the cops. Friendly advice: no funny stuff. Are you ok, Mom? Are you ok? Look at me. I'm so sorry. I hate myself. Come inside. Still here? I decided not to go. At breakfast, I gazed around at all these familiar things, the teapot, the teacups, the vases... If I went to that meeting, they'd cease to be mine. A feeling it would all be taken away. Our house would no longer be ours. And now? I feel better. It's best. He won't be back. Good. Thank you. - Why, it's Ben! - Who's that? Ben Torres. He worked here... temporarily. Mr. Keller didn't keep him. No, I didn't come. But how can you come here like this? I knew you'd be pleased. Too bad you didn't remember me. But you didn't care about your husband's staff. Over a year loading and unloading on your fucking piers. Three temp contracts. They say it's illegal. Your husband made me think he'd hire me for good. Until he sacked me. I understand your anger. But do you seriously think I can pay 30,000 euros like that? You'll pay me 35,000 euros. What do you mean? You said... I know what I said. But that was before you stood me up. So now it's 35,000. - Why're you doing this? - Doing what? This blackmail. Wanna make it 40,000? All I want is the money. But folks like you want everything. I'm doing it because I can. You must understand that. Your 15,000 euros. I'll need two signatures, please. One here, and there. Hand it over. How much? 15,000. 15,000? Are you shitting me? 15,000 is a hefty sum. I can't withdraw just like that. Bullshit. You're loaded. It's the company's money. The Board has to ok it. I don't give a fuck how! Either do what I say or your daughter hits the clink. Don't take me for a clown. Hang on. Thanks. Bust ass and get me the money. There's 12,000. Sweet. Why'd I only get peanuts before? When's the rest coming? Fast. What's your scheme? There is no scheme. Know the beach we went to with Dad? I buried Tito there. It's quiet. He adored you. Of course. I fed him. See how she's grown? She looks so like you. Think so? Why not go see her? It's not so far. Later she'll ask questions you can't answer. I'm saving up to go. I don't want her to think her dad's a bum. What's wrong? I prefer the dark. Come up to bed. Sometimes I wake up and I think he's there. Come to bed. You need your rest. What have I done, Mom? What have we done? What have I done? I'm so ashamed. I'm ashamed. What have I done? Come to bed. You need your rest. I'm ashamed. So ashamed. You need sleep. I'll give you a pill. That's all I could get. I tried to up them to 8,000, but no. Thank you, Patricia. One always bargains badly when in need. They know it. Do you have troubles? No, but I didn't wear that necklace. And Julia didn't want it. Hey, cuz! - Wanna hit? - No thanks. Well? I got a third. There's 7,000. You what? 15,000 to go. I want it tomorrow. I can't tomorrow. Hang on, whaddya mean? I can't just take money out. It can't be obvious. I have to juggle. So when? This weekend. But after that how can I know you'll stop? You can't. You're in no position to ask. Don't let me down. You ok? Breathe it in. Smell that fresh air? Isn't this a cool spot? Look. It's for the lookouts to warn of cop cars or dicey stuff. But me, I prefer to look this way. You feel like the world is yours. And at night, with the lights, just imagine. Rodolphe and me came up here a lot. Over there, up on that building. You? Yeah. Wicked, isn't it? Are you allowed to do that on buildings? Nah! Anyhow, I don't ask no one for nothing. I'm a bad ass. I see. I don't ask anyone for anything either. I'm a bad ass too. How do you get up there? I manage. I tag from balconies at night. It takes some climbing. But then, I own the place. Hi. Two. - Hi. - 'Evening. My name's Stéphane. Yeah, I know. You know? - What'll you have? - Vodka, please. Two vodkas. - Here's to you. - To you. Another one. Here's to you, Stéphane. It's really far! Wait, let me help you. - Can you manage? - Yes. - Stop! I changed my mind. - Why? Come on! I don't want to. Stop, I said! - Come here. - Stop! Let me go! Are you nuts? - Stop it! - You stop. Are you crazy? Leave me alone! Come on, it's ok. Stop. - Leave me alone! - Calm down. My daughter said to let her be! You brought me to your mother's? You're sick! - Get the hell out! - I'm going. She's a cocktease. - Out! - Right. Fuck you! Got a cigarette? Come here. It's too hard, Mom. I'm not as strong as you. I'm not that strong. It's instinct. It's to protect you. It has nothing to do with strength or anything like that. What are you doing to pay him? I manage. - I thought you blew me off. - I got lost. It's in there. How much? 3,000. Where do I go? Straight. I'll tell you. I ran a stop sign! Stay calm. We did nothing bad. Take the ticket and don't argue. Kill the engine, please. Papers. Registration and license. Do you know why? You ran a stop sign. I know. We were talking. I wasn't paying attention. Thank you. - Is everything alright? - Fine. Why? Please get out of the car. Why? Get out, ma'am. Calling all available units. Roger. We're on our way. Let's go. We have to go. Expect a ticket in the mail. How goes it, crew? And you? Everything cool? Shit! Why're you here? Your neighbors will hate me. I knocked on all the doors to find you. Who's there, Ben? Nothing, a mistake. - Is this the Calavera place? - Yes. Are you Greg? I was a friend of Rodolphe's. Mom! A friend of Rodolphe's. I'm Julia. I don't want to bother you. You're not. Come in. - Did you know Rodolphe well? - Yes, kind of. The police say it was a gang killing. But I don't get it. Forgive me. It's like fatigue. You can't fight it. Maybe it is fatigue. Something to drink? Yes. Maybe something strong. Have a seat. Rodolphe found us this apartment. He came to see us a few times a week. Sometimes he slept with the boy. Excuse me. Rodolphe's mom called. - What're you doing here? - Why? Playing the mourner? Who d'you think you are? Tell her not to go near Rodolphe's family! He didn't give a shit about you. Isn't that why you killed him? Know what he called you? He said you were just a rich cripple. Lay off me too! - Just beat it! - Stop. She better not go back there. It makes me go nuts. Thanks for bringing her home. Enough. I've had it. I want to quit. I'm tired. You can't do it alone. It's a hard habit to kick. Let me call the clinic. It's nice to see you here. You never come. You could work with me. Don't we spend enough time together? What would I do? I know nothing. Neither did I, so I learned. When I get confused about container ships or multifunction vessels, then I fake it. I don't mind being the boss. What bugs me is all the rest. These shoes hurt. Feet need to breathe. Mom, I'm going to call Olivier. I want to be tried. You won't survive in prison. It won't bring him back. You'll get 10-15 years, I don't know. Where will I be then? Your father wasn't in jail long, but I'll never forget those corridors, that smell. Still, I killed him. What do you know? What do you mean? Remember the state you were in? Get it out of your head that you killed him. You didn't kill him. Tell yourself that. It never happened. Well? Nothing today. I need more time. Are you kidding? I can't get more! It's too hard. It's too hard. I can't anymore. What if I stop? You're smarter than that. Figure it out. Get me the dough. Tuesday. - I can't invent money! - Figure it out. Save your neck and I disappear. Don't forget, I'm your best friend. Goddammit! Spying on me? That bother you? It's not nice not to return my calls. - You'll get it Tuesday. - How? You have a scheme. What's your scheme? - Not your business, man. - What is it? You'll get your dough, that's all. I asked, what's your scheme? Cut it out! Answer when asked, got that? Let me go! Ben, what's going on? Nothing! Get out of here! Who's that? - Who's that? - You don't know her. I want my dough Tuesday. - Got that? - Yes. Now beat it. Fucking bastard! Leave me alone. Leave me alone! You just walk in now? Where's Louise? Tell me, what's going on with those guys? - None of your business. - You think? Why the look? Wondering if you have great tits, as Rod said. Not bad, I think. But settle for imagining. Forget it. Can I ask a question? What? Do you have anything of Rodolphe? On your phone? Videos or a message? Are you joking? I remember everything but his voice. I have nothing left. How's lover boy? Lover boy! Wait till you get a girl. Check it out. Hang on. Stop it! She seen your scrawny legs? Enough! I loved him. I know he used me. But I loved him. How'd you kill him? Did you plan it? Catch him off guard, or look him in the eye? Answer me! Lay off! - Leave me alone. - Little clown. Hi. The money's not here. Need a hand? Is it for them? What? The money. For those guys I saw? What does it matter? What do they know? Nothing. I owe them money and you're the way I can pay them. I'm sorry. Otherwise what happens? I don't know. You read 'em all? I'll never have time to read them all. So why so many books? I had a bookstore. I lived with books. I loved that. I had to sell it when I took over my husband's business. Where'd you meet? Aren't you nosy! In Hamburg. I taught in the French school. But I missed France. Not France. Actually, this area. When I visited this house I knew I wanted to live here. But it was big. Too big. We were young and carefree. Julia was 16 but hardly spoke French. Now I want to move. Here. It was at Rodolphe's. I thought it was gone forever. I was fond of it. Here, it's yours. Really? Thanks. Thanks, Amine. Well? Here. Where you getting it? Not your business, cousin. You messing with me? Where's the money coming from? What is this? Hold it, Daniel! Hang on. Like that? Stop it! Don't move! Let go of him! Let him go! Karim, move it! Filthy bastard! You're in for it. Shut up. Guns! Hand over your guns! Your gun! Come with me. Don't do this. We'll yank your teeth one by one until you croak! Fuck. You scared me! Can you do me a favor? What's going on? Guys are after me. I can't go home. Put me up a night or two. If I'm not around, they'll think I split. So? Why you hiding out here? Scared? Keep it up. In fact, you're scared. You act tough, then you wimp out. It's all show. Like saying you do graf murals for a living! Bullshit to impress my mom. And she believes you. If you wanted a skill, you'd have one. You stinking little rich kid! Think it's enough to want something? Yes, I do. If you want to, you can. It's when you can't that you're through. You'd rather act like a big shot. You want to be like Rodolphe. But you can't hold a candle to him, you clown. Kiss me. What? You're sick! How's that? Just what I expected. Mrs. Keller? Yes. - Everything ok? - Why? Who is this? We're looking for Ben. Ben Torres. Who's Ben Torres? Sure of yourself? Yes. Who are you? It's them. - I gotta go. - No way. That's the safety. Then just shoot. I'll never manage. Turn off the lights. I see them. Sure of yourself? Yes, I'm sure it's here. Ask what they want. Come out, Ben! If they know I'm here, we're dead. Go on, Mom. Who's there? Mrs. Keller? What do you want? To ask you something. Who are you? Go away! Open up. I can't use this! Give it to me. Go on! Go away! We're looking for Ben. Ben Torres. Don't know him. You've no business here. He killed a man. Did you know? I'm not hiding anyone. I called the police. They're coming. Go away. Go away! Go away! It's ok, Mom. It's over. Let's go inside. You showed those assholes. Thank you. I'd never killed a man. It was me or him. I'm sorry. They won't give up. When I met you, I thought it was my lucky day. There's no such thing. Sir, I want... Leaving? Yeah. How long have we known each other? Forever. It'll be weird not seeing you. I'll miss you, man. When'll you stop this, Ben? Two guys came looking for you, asking where you were. Wanna end up like Rodolphe? I'm stopping now. I'm going away. If the cops come, give 'em this. - What is it? - Don't open it. Just give it to 'em. - Where you going? - I'll call when I get there. Going to see your daughter? I love you. Are you? Yes. - It's Louise. - I'll call ya back. I'm worried. Why'd you take off? Later. What're you doing, man? Open up! Ben! What's going on? Why's she give you dough? Something about Rodolphe's death? Do yourself a favor: Talk, fuckhead. Don't think we'll go back and see her? Go fuck yourself. You'll see who's fucked. Who's fucked? Sonofabitch! Fucking sonofabitch! Well? Your mother! You're gonna smoke, for Bruno! Little bitch. To what do I owe the pleasure? I want to report a missing person. A minor? No, a young man. For how long? Yesterday. That's not missing. Aren't you overreacting? I'm sure something's happened. His name is Ben Torres. He lives in the Thau Island projects. It's not my business, but I think something awful happened. Excuse me, Louise, but what's your relationship? He's a former employee. I'm worried about him. He seemed lost. But I... Maybe I'm imagining things. We'll check it out. He was found this morning, dead, pretty messed up. Isn't this yours? He must have stolen it. No, I'd given it to him. Louise, that boy was a killer. His mother gave us this. What? Sir, I want someone to understand, and I want it to be you. I lied to you about Rodolphe Calavera. It was too soon. I thought I'd get away with it. I know I won't be free for long. You might arrest me any day. So I'd rather leave. Yes, I killed Rodolphe Calavera. But I never meant to. I loved him. He was my friend.
