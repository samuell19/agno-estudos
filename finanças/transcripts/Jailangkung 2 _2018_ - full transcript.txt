It's you again! -What's going on now? -Come here. What is it? Did you see how much money that guy gave to the Captain... ...just to bring that box? Yes, I saw it from before. What's inside that box anyway? That must be a one precious box. It must came with a high price. Let's check it out downstairs. We shouldn't keep doing this. How are we going to change our live then? What makes you think that way? I'm not that kind of person. I'm just curious. Listen, Din, if you won't tag along, just let us be. Just stay put. That's right. Just stay put. Wait for me! I wanna come too! Where's the Captain? We're gonna be busted for sure. Don't be scared, I'd take responsibility of it. He's behind the wheel anyway, he has no clue at all. Just follow me. -I'm worried. -Be quiet. It's one suspicious box indeed. Go on and take a look. It's just a box. Let's head back now. Take it easy, it's on me. Wait here. What's wrong with you? There is a girl inside that box. Hold on. "Jailangkung 2" "Congratulations on your new home" Dad? My dear Diani. I still can't believe you are on 6th place in class. I'm so proud of you. Congratulations once again! My dear. Let's grab some ice cream now. -Let's go. -Okay. Tasya. You okay right? Have you been waiting long? Am I late? If not, I'm gonna go upstairs to get your report card. Okay? Sorry. -Good morning, sir. -Morning. -Where is your grandad? -He's at home. I'm here to get grandad's stuff. Wait a minute. Your grandad and I have known each other ages ago. Since the dollars currency is only 600 rupiah. Here you go. The difference is I'm a hard-worker... ...while he's into meditation and spiritual stuff. Like this one. Open this book. Here is the book that he ordered from me. It's full of mystic stuff, such as Matianak, Ndas Glundung... See. Don't mimic this stuff. Such a waste of your handsome face if you are into this things. I'm going to let him know. Don't do that. He's gonna kill me with his black magic. "Matianak" "Ndas Glundung" Ram... Hi, Bel. Here's my grandad's book. He told me to get this book. And I think you need to see this. You'd better read it. Dad, I'll go first. Go ahead. -Dad... -Huh? Kak Angel's so weird lately. Just look at her. We'll find a way to make it clear. Give me the pepper. -No, its not like that... -No... Give me the pepper! Call the Jailangkung. Call the Jailangkung. Call the Jailangkung. Play with me... Did you get the report card yet? Who took the report card? My mother, Doc. Then how was it? Many red marks. I got the last place. Your report card's on fire. You got the last place. Yeah. At least my mother is the one who took it. Where's your mother anyway? Where's your mother? Where's your mother? Where's your mother? Where's your mother? Where's your mother... Jailangkung, Jailangkung. There's a little ceremony here. Sarah Wijanarko, I will carry you here, please come out and reveal yourself. Jailangkung Jailangkung. There's a little ceremony here. Sarah Wijanarko, I will carry you here, please come out and reveal yourself. Jailangkung, Jailangkung. There's a little ceremony here. Sarah Wijanarko, I will carry you here, please come out and reveal yourself. Jailangkung, Jailangkung. There's a little ceremony here. Sarah Wijanarko, I will carry you here, please come out and reveal yourself. -Stop it! -Sarah. Sarah, I'm glad I could see you again. What did we talk about last time? Dad! Look! Tasya's here. Tasya... ...why are you still awake? Go to sleep, it's already late. Dad, I told you. There's something wrong with Kak Angel. Just look at the falling plates from before. Bel... ...try to remember. Is there something you didn't tell me when I was in a comma state? Well? Back then... ...Angel went missing. Until Rama and I found her in a graveyard. She was holding a baby. And she told us the baby is hers. No, there's no way. She is not pregnant. -It's not like I'm in a coma for months... -Dad, that's enough. We gotta ask her now. -Angel? -Kak Angel... -Angel? -Kak Angel... Kak Angel. -That baby is... -This baby came from my womb. But that baby... She was born unnaturally. What so unnatural about it, Bel? You were pregnant all of a sudden... -...and you gave birth in a grave... -I gave birth to her. Angel... ...that baby can't live in this house. Why is that so? You do still want to protect your child, don't you? All of you will be safe. As long as you don't disturb my child. Kak Angel... Bel... Dad, that baby must be a Matianak. Bel... ...I want us to live normally again. I want you to stop thinking about it. I'll take care of Angel. -But Dad... -Bella, listen to me please. As long as Matianak stay inside our house, something's going to happen for sure. Now she is back. Go away! Get out! She is back. You know whom you should go to, right? Come here and play with me. Don't go home until you die. Even though I don't know how accurate this book is, this book is quite interesting. What's the content of this book? The interesting thing is it's about Matianak. I know it already. Bel. Are you okay? Yesterday... ...I... I saw... What did you see? I'm going to the restroom. Sorry. "Out of Order" Who's there? What happened? -Calm down... Just breath. -I... -I... -Calm down. -How come you suddenly... -Hey, what happened? Rama! Sorry, I mean no harm. I'm new around here. My name is Bram. Hey, what's wrong? There's something in there. -I swear, I something, Ram. -Calm down. Let's go to the cafe and calm yourself down. Let's go. Are you coming or not? You are from Anthropology class? That means you know about Matianak. Hold on. Why did you bring up Matianak to this matter? It's a long story. But my sister brought Matianak to our house. Now I'm haunted. Not to brag myself or stuff, but I know where Matianak came from. Yeah? Do you know about Nyi Roro Kidul? Nyi Roro Kidul has nine maids. One of them fell in love with a human... ...and they had a supernatural child... ...called Matianak. Usually humans go after Matianak for three purposes. For wealth, power, and for immunity. That's why humans created an amulet. It's known as Kurungsukmo. It is an amulet to defeat Matianak. Then, I need to find that Kurungsukmo to oust Matianak? Yeah. How am I going to find it? Have you ever heard about the SS Ourang Medan ship? SS Ourang Medan? Hold on. I believe it was an old ship that exploded and sinked. That's right. Matianak will be destroy if the Kurungsukmo necklace is collided. The story is SS Ourang Medan ship was found with no crew on board. All of the ship crew was dead with scared expression on. Captain, help. All of the crew is dead. There's only a few people know about the real story. When it was occurring, Matianak was on board. Hold up. How did they took Matianak on board SS Ourang Medan ship? They put the Kurungsukmo necklace around her neck. It will weaken her. But somehow it managed to escape... ...and killed everyone in sight. Matianak moved into SS Ourang Medan ship. Matianak got away. The ship exploded. There's a huge possibility of the amulet being sinked along with the ship. We gotta find that ship, Ram. There's a nearest lighthouse... ...that got the radio signal of SS Ourang Medan ship. We will obtain the ship coordinate if we go to the lighthouse. Okay, we go there immediately. From now on, mommy will protect you. And my only duty is to protect you. Kung Kung Jailangkung Do you know where my mom is? I want to meet my mom. I've never known my mom after all of this time. Kung, call out your friends. Call my mom. I want to meet her. I miss her. Please call her. Tas? Tasya. Tasya! Tasya! Angel. Angel. Angel, have you seen Tasya? Where is she? She's missing. I look for her everywhere, but still unable to find her. I also... Angel... Dad. Bel. -Tasya is missing. -What do you mean? Have you ask Kak Angel yet? She doesn't know and she doesn't care. This gotta be it. This has something to do with Matianak inside our house, Dad. Rama and I know how to annihilate Matianak. By putting the amulet around her neck. The problem is, where is the amulet? Do you have any idea where to find it? I know, sir. -Who are you? -I'm Bram. A friend of Bella and Rama. May I go to call my grandma for help? Sure. Are you sure you know the place? I'm positive, sir. Okay. You gotta go now. Let me take care everything around here. We gotta split up. To put this to an end. Tomorrow morning there will be someone called Bu Suwito come over. Okay. We should get going then. Okay. Bye, Dad. Be careful. -Sir. -Be careful. The last coordinate of the SS Ourang Medan ship... ...got caught in this lighthouse. We are going to get there around 6 AM. Are you sure they still keep the archive? It got abandoned long ago. The only way to find out is to go there. It all caused by Dad playing the Jailangkung before. That's enough, Bel. Your dad miss your mom so much. Stop dwelling in the past. Ram, I want to go there first. -I'm going to grab some snacks. -Okay. -Sir, fill the gas please. -Okay. -Ram? -Yeah? How come there's no one on the cashier? -There's no one around? -Yeah. Just grab anything for now. Probably they went to the toilet. They'll be there soon. Okay then. Rama! Rama! Rama! Ram! The exit. I need to find the exit. Bella! Bel! Bella! Thanks for calling, this was a voice message service. Please hold... Bella! Bel... Where's Rama? He went after you. Bella. Bella. Bella. Bel... Bella. Bella. I didn't met him. Where is Rama? I swear, Bel. He went after you. What's with you? What do we do now? I didn't see him at all. It's Rama! Rama! Hurry up, Rama! Come on, Ram. Matianak has tons of army. The more we are trying to get rid of her, the more we are disturbed. Bella. They say here is where the Dutch murdered all of their war prisoners. As for their head, they all got cut off. If you are scared, just say it. If you have less stamina, just say it. I'd make it easy for you. -You go first. -No, you go first. Hope the transcript is not destroyed yet. Bella. Bella. Bella. Madam Suwito. Please come in. I have no idea what's inside your house. But there's so many spirits came surround this place. Spirits? Yes. The one from the grave. Even they already went inside the house. Anyway... It seems like my daughter was playing the Jailangkung. Gosh. To play the Jailangkung, one must ready to obey tons of the rules that come with it. This ritual should be in a place confidential. Until it leaked. There's so many people misused it. If it's not by the rules, it could bring harm to us. Give it to me. Here. Madam. How about my daughter? Where is Tasya? She's on the other side. There should be someone willing to go and get her. I will get her. Tell me how to get her. What year did the ship sinked? In 1947. Bram. What is it, Ram? This is the last Morse script of the SS Ourang Medan ship. What does it say? "SOS... SOS..." "Help. Our ship is under attack. All of the crew is dead." "Our coordinate is 5" South Latitude and 101" East Longitude." Meaning that the ship was sinked in this coordinate, Bram. That means we know where the amulet is. Let's go. Hey! Hey! Who is it? Did you get it? -Yeah, we got it. -Okay. Come on! "SOS from Ourang Medan." "We are floating." "All crew including the captain is dead." "Maybe all of the crew is dead." And then... There's a message. What is it? "We are dead." This Wikipedia is right. Is the coordinate of SS Ourang Medan ship written on the script? Yes, it is. Have you get the ship yet, Bel? Yes, I have. In fact, they're waiting for us. Okay, let's go. -Ram. Could you help me? -Sure. Is this your lucky bracelet? Guys. Be careful down there. -Is it clear? -It's clear. Do you know where you are? Madam, where should I headed to? Keep moving forward. Follow my voice. What's your heart is looking for is seen by your eyes. What did you see? I'm seeing a big ancient palace. It looks just like a big house in the middle of the woods. What else do you see? There's a little stone gate with lions guarding it. That is Keraton Alas Ketonggo. What is it? It's a mystical palace of the other side. It's a medium to the afterlife. You are in a royal hall. Ask permission when passing through. You should behave. You are just a visitor. Tasya. What was that Ram? It called Rai Alus. I'm glad you saved my life. You still have the amulet with you, right? Yeah. Guys, are you okay? All good. So intimate. Tasya. Tasya. Madam. I found Tasya. Where is she? She's in the arms of a spirit. Grab the torch next to you and distract it. Which torch? Which torch, Madam? Get the torch and distract it attention. But there are no torch around here. The torch is in your hand, Ferdi. Come out. Come on out! Get out from there! Come on out! Get out! Tasya. Come on. Madam Suwito! I've got Tasya! Help me! Madam Suwito, help me out! Madam Suwito! Help me! Help me please! They are after me! Madam Suwito... Follow the light. Madam... Madam! Here she is. It's Tasya. Thanks for bring her back to me. But she's still unconscious. What should we do next? There's still something left attached to her. What should we do? She's got something attached to her body. Let me. -Is this the Jailangkung that she used? -That's right. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Thank you, Madam. -Tasya. -Bella. -Bella. -Dad. Where have you been, Tasya? Bel... Bu Suwito helped me find Tasya. -Ram. -Sir. -Madam, look at that. -Hold Tasya. Madam! Madam Suwito! Come on. Come on. Dad! -Dad! -Yeah! Get Tasya out from here! I've got this. Tasya. Come on quick! Ram, Bram. Help me put it around her neck. Let's do it. Tasya. Sit down. Are you okay? Look at me, Tas! Okay. Tasya. Dad. They are outside. Tasya. It's okay. As long as they are outside, we'll be safe, okay? -Tasya. -Dad. They are no longer outside. How does it feel to be deceived? All those hard work to dive into the ocean... ...for the amulet. Bram. What was this all about? Who is he? He is my grandpa. You know whom you should go to, right? What's the content of this book? I know it already. Our family keep Matianak for five generation. And after all of this time losing it, you help us brought it back. -Ram, you... -Don't you know? With this amulet, I can control the Matianak. Now... ...I want to stand up just like before. I'm standing up! Bram! What do you want? Do you remember... ...you once told me... ...that you've done the exact same thing to Grandmother. Let's call it a karma then. Do you really think you can handle it? You have no knowledge, you are still a newbie. There's so much for you to learn, Bram! You never trust me. I'm a grown up man, Grandpa! Stop thinking about what I can't do while you can. Bram... You will never replace me. Ever. Kill my grandfather now! Bram... That's impossible. Now! Kill my grandfather! Kill him now! Kak Angel. Bel... Matianak. Kill them all! Kill them all now! Don't disturb my family! Anak, do what mommy told you. Listen to me. Don't disturb my family! Kill your mom! Kill your mom now! Kill your mom! Matianak will be destroy if the Kurungsukmo necklace is collided. Let's go.
