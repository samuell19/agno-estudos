The ears are warm now. What about your nose? My nose? The Man Who Surprised Everyone Is it too heavy? Put your weapons on the ground. Gun him down! Are you alive? Fucker! Just remember - these pills will kill the pain for some time, but then the effect will die down. Can you tell me exactly how long I have left? I can't say exactly. Maybe 2 months. Each case is different. Have you made your mind up about a hospice? I talked about one that would make it easier for your family. Everything is provided, breakfast, lunch, dinner, linens, painkillers, all at the state's expense. I'll think about. I have some time. You said 2 months. I didn't say 2 months. I said, 2 months maybe... Will my wife be able to withdraw it? Yes, by proxy. But if you open one for 3 months you can get more benefits. No, just 2 months. It's fine. Oh, hey there Egor Petrovich. Is that it? Got anything tasty? Egor! Hey. What did the law enforcement tell you? Everything was legal? Self-defense? Zakhar, when are you gonna fix the problem with the power station? Well, I took care of it. They notified me. They'll factor in the times it was shut off. So, there'll be blackouts in winter again, we'll stay without electricity and then they'll factor it in? - Well, what can I do? - Do something, at least. So? What did they tell you? The limits of self-defense were not exceeded. So... I thought they would put you in jail. They won't. Don't worry. - Alright. - Oh, hey Dad! - What's this? - There you go! Wow... We're going to have dinner soon. - Dad, did you get a big scar? - It's small. Everyone at school says you're a tough guy. Where's the grub? Wait, dad. What's this? - Cod's liver. - A delicacy. Egor bought it, just a little surprise. We're going to have it with potatoes... Dad... It's shit. He's become a burden. Dad's become a burden... Listen, we should fix up mom's gravesite. But probably in the spring, right? We shouldn't do it now. Cause it'll settle down during the winter. Yep. Look what I bought from the Chinese. Pretty isn't it? It's for our baby girl. Will you let me sleep? Go to sleep. Sleep. No one is bothering you... Why aren't you sleeping? Sleep. I can't. Natasha, we shouldn't... When I was pregnant with Artyom, you didn't care. Look, it bursts here... Of course it bursts, it is all rotten... Come on or you'll be running back and forth. Egor! Egor! Natasha! Natasha! I was up on the roof and then I landed on the couch. What is this? Egor! Dad, what is this? Get out of here! Sit down. I put some money in the bank, with interest. and we're going to make it in your name. So you won't waste time getting it through my will. Should be enough for the funeral. You should sell the hayfields. 2 hectares of land, that should be good money. You should apply for state aid, survivor's benefit for each child. I wrote it down here, a type of checklist. Don't say anything to anyone. I got sick and that's that. We'll get the rest of the harvest, and I'll go to a hospice. They said that we won't have to pay for it. So we won't be wasting money. Are you listening to me? You'll go to the medics. Natasha... Even the most hopeless cases can be cured nowadays. Natasha, there are no options. Who said that? Our local doctors? They're all idiots! There are other doctors. We just need to get some money. We can get some. People will help us. Let's not involve anyone else in this. I'm not going to beg. Can we somehow speed up the modernization process? To avoid new blackouts. My people are growling. There are some highly nervous ones. Well yea. Wait a bit. I'll be running for local council in spring, I don't need this tension. The thing is no one's gonna remember that I set up their celebration of the village day. People forget the good you do. This professor from Moscow will stay for only a week. there's going to be some kind of seminar. We just don't have that much. Yeah, force majeure. - Where's Egor? - He's at work. Ok, you go ahead and ask around the village. They'll give you at least what they can... And I'll try to find something in the reserve fund. Whatever is left in there. Thank you. Don't thank me yet. Just don't tell Egor about this. Okay? Be strong... I was hiding it from Stepan, so he wouldn't spend it all on booze. I would give more money, if there was any more.... Thank you. So they grab the goat and bring it to the veterinarian. He takes an X-ray examination and says "How am I going to get your money out? The paper bills are already half digested.” Vasilich says "Cut it open, at least we'll save a half”. And Oksana says: "No. I won't let you kill the goat for your half-digested money. Next time you won't hide it in the goat shed". - Let me give you some more. - No, I'm fine. Good evening everyone. Bon Appetit. Oh, Zakhar Victorovich. Come join us. No I can't, I don't have time. Here... You like to criticize your countrymen, but they don't remember your hate. Good-bye. Egor, we really love you and respect you, We know you're a strong man and a proud one. Just do us a favour, please. - We need to go to the doctor. - We closed this subject. You closed it. Dad... Please... Please excuse me, but I won't take your money. Don't worry about it, we have money, we can pay... No, it's almost at the terminal stage. I'm sorry but I'm afraid I can't help you. But there are new medicinal products nowadays. - Please take the money... - Hold yourself together! Please, I'm begging you! Please! Wait, Egor! Please take the money! Natasha... You're holding it tight. You like to hold things tight? You can't hold everything tight. You won't be able to. Just try to let go. Come on... There you go... That's it, I cleansed him. Thanks. Don't look back on your way home. They say that a blind man was brought to her last year. She touched him, and he began to see. I'm not blind. Remember, when you served in the Navy I came to visit you at the sea? Remember the storm on the 3rd day? You were on guard duty. I was all alone and I felt sad. So I went to the pier. There was a storm, the sea was raging. It was beautiful. So I was on the pier and the 1st wave hit my knees; the 2nd one hit my chest. The 3rd one pulled me into the water. I never told you this. I started to struggle in the ice cold water. Then I saw some alcoholics walking down the shore. They saw me and ran up with a stick. and they started to throw it to me. "Grab it!" But the waves were pulling me away. I felt I was running out of strength. I was ready to give up. I fell into a state of apathy. But suddenly I thought "Well yeah, so I'm going to drown now, and they'll come to you and tell you about it. And you will just stand there silently..." And I just felt so sorry for you. Natasha... And I started to feel sorry for myself. So I just pulled through and got hold of the stick. Then they pulled me out. They gave me a coat and some alcohol. They even walked me to the dormitory. I didn't even catch a cold. - It didn't help you? - Was it supposed to help? Well, I can't give you your money back. I spent it all on vodka. I'm going to tell you a little story. The Story of Jumba the Drake and Death. There lived drake upon a lake. Jumba was his name. His time to die came. Just like with you, but he didn't want to die... So here's what this smartass come up with... He walked out on the road, and rolled around in the dust. He became grey as a duck. He looked just like a duck. And when Death came to take him away, She couldn't recognize him among the ducks. So Death went home empty. Jumba tricked her. - Dad, you need some help? - No, it's fine. I got an ‘A' in math today. For the 1st time. Good job. Go on with it. Artyom, what's wrong? You're a man. Just like that. Yeah. Hey! Are you busy? No. Do you mind if I smoke? Egor, just don't lose faith. Maybe it still can be cured. I have a tumor too, in my throat. It's been there for a while, it's just encapsulated. That's what they said. If you need anything, just tell me. Ok, Stepa, if I need anything, I'll let you know. Get better. Egor... Egor... Stop right there, bitch! Who are you? Egor! What is all of this? Wait! What's wrong? You overslept, Natasha. Egor, talk to me. Can you hear me? Egor! Can you hear me? Don't come in the house. - Where's dad? - Dad? He isn't feeling well. He decided to live in the sauna for a bit. Eat. - Where are you going? - To see dad. Sit down. Sit down, I said. Artyom, you're already grown up. Dad isn't feeling well. He doesn't want to see anyone. He doesn't want us to see him weak? Eat. You gonna be late for school. Have you gone mad? Get out of here! I won't let you, bitch! I forbid you! You wanna shame all of us, you bastard? Why can't you just die normally? Thanks dad... - Where's Artyom? - He went off with the boys. Did you guys eat? There was buckwheat left. Yeah, that's what we had to eat. You should bring some to Egor. I will. - Come on. - Pass. - Right here. Come on. - Pass. - Go! Go! - Pass. Go! Go! Will someone give me a pass? We don't play with fags. What? who's a fag here? Your father is a fag and you're too! - You're the fags! - What did you just say? You think you're tough huh? Now you'll know... Bastard! You creep! Take that, you bitch. Dad! Dad! Please come out... Dad! I don't believe what they say! Dad, come out... They're all lying! It's not true. Dad, please... Dad, please... Tyoma... Tyoma, get up... I'm not going to school. Natasha, what's that crowd doing in front of our house? - I don't believe it. - But why is he hiding? Natasha, what's going on out there? Egor! They won't leave. Come out here, say something to them... Tell them you had a mental breakdown because of your sickness. Or I could tell them that you were just joking. I only want the best for you. How much time do you have left? Just die like a man. - What are you doing out here? - I want to speak with Egor. - I said get out of here! - Why are you yelling at him? - Where do you think you're going? - Have Egor come out. Get out of here! Let's break the door and see. Get out of my yard! Get out of here! Open up, Egor! You can't go inside. He's ill. Is that clear? - Egor! - Leave! Get out of here! Step back! We'll just take a look and go. Get out of my yard! Egor Petrovich? Get up. Egor, that's enough. We don't need your "parades” here. You either stop this or get lost. Guys, what are you doing? Come on that's enough! Are you nuts? Stop that, now! Get away! All of you! Move it! Get the fuck outta here! Hi there. Nice to meet you. You're so pretty. I haven't been with a woman for a month.
