"Umegaoka... Annual Concert" Umegaoka... symphony? "Umegaoka Symphony Orchestra" "Members wanted! Please contact below" Nonomura here. I really loved your performance. Thanks. I played in an orchestra in college. But once I got a job, I stopped playing. And then... hearing your orchestra reawakened something in me. So I was wondering... um... if I might have a chance at joining. Well, I don't know... It's very forward of me, I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have bothered you. Thanks for your time. Wait, don't hang up. What? We'd love to have you. Please join us. You mean the orchestra? Do you mean it? Thank you! Thank you! "Central Community Hall" "Umegaoka Symphony Orchestra" Has anyone come? Not yet. Hello. Why don't we take a seat over here. Oh boy! Thanks. Careful now. Hello. Are you okay? That's such a heavy instrument. Is everything okay? There you go. - Mr. Rabaul. - Take a seat right here. How're you feeling? My daughter gave this to me, but I can't make heads or tails of it. What am I supposed to do with this? It's a nuisance. It's the Intersect. It's ringing. Hello? "Sex Soldiers" Sex... "Sex Soldiers" Are you Ms. Koyama? Chizuru Koyama? Yes. I'm Nonomura, Umegaoka Symphony Orchestra conductor. You don't know how glad I am to see you. This is truly wonderful. Everyone's here. Pardon me. - But will the other members... - What? Will the other members from yesterday be arriving later? Yesterday? What was yesterday? The concert, of course. Concert? We didn't have one. At the Umegaoka Concert Hall? Concert hall... Oh, the "Ume Phil" had their regular performance, I believe. "Ume Phil"? The Umegaoka Philharmonic. People get us confused sometimes. What? Wrong orchestra? We have absolutely no relation to them whatsoever. But forget that. You don't know how happy I am to have you join our "okeh" (casket). "Okeh"? Your casket? Our casket? No, our orchestra. "Okeh" for "orchestra". Excuse me, I was in shock for a second. We're the Umegaoka Symphony Orchestra. Not the philharmonic. "Ume-Sym" for short. Oh, thank you. Thanks for the keys. The room is ours. This way. Let's start today... with "Pomp and Circumstance". It's Elgar! A standard for amateur units. Not too hard. At least its Classical music. A maestro in his 70s or 80s is common. Who knows? They might be good. "GOLDEN ORCHESTRA!" Elgar's turning in his grave. There's no bowing unison. No rhythm. The reason is clear. No one sees the conductor. And he doesn't see them. They just make faces. Please make it stop. Just pretend to be playing. Stop staring. Oh my! A new record! What is it? Huh? What just happened? Are you kidding? We've never gotten this far before. Our previous best was bar 98. We just couldn't break the 100 barrier. But we just blew past it by 14 bars! I hardly know what to do with myself. Great work! We've been progressing. They were worse? The hot cakes have cooled. I brought pickles for everyone. How about you? It's homemade. Help yourself. Today, I've booked a restaurant so we can welcome our newest member. You have? Do you have somewhere to go? Um... Farewell, Rabaul, we'll return again! Often I cry youthful tears for thee! What do you think of our orchestra? Give it to me straight, Miss Koyama. I can handle it. Give it to you straight, huh? Pathetic! The worst orchestra ever! The worst? Oh... let me see now. There's room for improvement in tonality and ensemble harmonics. Yes, I agree. I think you may have a point there. You may be right. Not "may", but definitely. Really? Even the Berlin Phil makes mistakes. Even Karajan makes mistakes. Don't even compare. I'm talking about the fundamentals of making music. This girl knows a thing or two about music. So how do we get these fundamentals you speak of? Exactly! Through practice. Simply practice. - But we do practice. - We practice, don't we? More... until you can do what you couldn't before. She's right. I can't read the small letters on today's telephones. Practice! Eat up. Thanks. You're never too old to join our merry band. Thank you. Drink up. Don't hold back. Finish that first. That's more like it. - Good morning! - Yes, good morning. Morning. Miss Koyama. Good morning. - Morning, Teacher! - Good morning. What's on the test? Not telling. Excuse me, Miss Koyama. - Just a hint. - No way. So there is an equation that can solve the problem. It may not seem so conventionally. But what's used here is what we call an imaginary root. It's not real, but then again... it is. You. In the back. Wake up, please. What does this graph show? This contacts the line at just one point. The name for this quadratic equation is...? Saggy boob. Okay, pipe down! Quiet, please! Be sure to write this down. Sorry to go over. Not at all. Take your time. See you. Yes. Teacher? What's up? Miss Koyama. Who, me? My grandfather asked me to thank you for coming yesterday. Grandfather? Your grandfather knows Miss Koyama, Nonomura? Nonomura? I'm Kazune Nonomura. She joined my grandfather's orchestra. Not exactly. That's wonderful, Miss Koyama. An orchestra? That's amazing. Not at all. My grandpa said you're really great. That reminds me. He felt guilty for not calling you a taxi. After you walked into a telephone pole. Look at the time! Homeroom is starting. Hurry! Give my regards to your grandfather. I will. Please favor him with your kindness. Ouch! What's your problem? Ow. Is that a hearing aid? He can't hear without it, so he just starts banging. Aren't old folks fun? You never know what will happen. He had a heavenly vibrato. What a shame. Please try to stay strong. But it was all so sudden. My deepest condolences. "Umegaoka Symphony Orchestra" Any one of our members could go at any time. I was thinking... would you be our first violin? God help me. "Request for Dismissal" Ume-Phil waits. I'm definitely quitting. How about asking Miss Koyama to be concertmaster? Yes, that's a great idea. Wait a second. I've only just recently joined the group. It's not about seniority. It's about desire. Yes, whoever wants to do it. Please do it. It's not that I don't want to, but... A word from our new concertmaster, Miss Koyama. I'm a bit green at this, but I'll do my best. I am such an idiot! Congratulations. Let's drink. Drink, drink, drink. Each rehearsal ended with a "steering meeting". In short, drinking. But that wasn't the worst. Umegaoka Philharmonic, bah! They tricked us... made us look like fools. Four years ago... We were betrayed by our concert master, Osawa. That cur. He quit, taking many of our best members with him. And then what did he go and do? He created the Umegaoka Philharmonic. That devil! I hope he dies of rabies from a dog bite. Are you listening? Yes, yes. But there was another reason for Nonomura's hatred of Osawa. "Nonomura's Radio Shop" Osawa Electric, Osawa Electric "Osawa Electric" "For all your appliance needs, it's Osawa!" You're planning to join the "Ume-Phil"? I don't know if they'll have me but... I want to continue my music. You're multi-talented, Miss Koyama. It's funny, but I feel energized whenever I'm around you, Miss Koyama. Really? Darn. I really wanted that last croquette. Too bad. Teacher. Excuse me. What? What's this about? The "Ume-Phil"? You know very well its relation to us. My grandpa has a weak heart. Then tell him this. All I want is to play in a real orchestra. I have a feeling that's why people left "Ume-Sym" to go build "Ume-Phil". I have a feeling that's why people left "Ume-Sym" to go build "Ume-Phil". I'm sorry. I've nothing more to say. Grandpa wants you to hear him out just one last time. Will you listen to him? Like I said. I've nothing more to say. He feels bad... for causing you such trouble. Listen. I'm only meeting him to get closure, all right? I understand. "Hotel Imperial" What, here? Are you sure? Yes. Mr. Kura? What're you doing? Are you okay, Mr. Kura? Careful! What? I got it. Mr. Nonomura? What? This looks bad. An orchestra member and high school teacher in suspect circumstances. What if this were sent to the school? What about it? Me and you? It's a little far-fetched, don't you think? Is that so? Don't get us wrong. We're not the least interested in bringing you down. We just want you to forget this talk of... quitting the orchestra. Miss Koyama... we beg you. Please don't quit. Mr. Nonomura. You dressed up, hiding out all this time... to capture this one moment just so I would stay? That's correct. Look at this, and think hard about it. What's wrong? What did you push, Grandpa? You deleted it! I told you to learn how to use it first! Is there a problem? I hate digital. I hate digital! It's okay, Grandpa. Stop exaggerating, Mr. Nonomura. He's a good actor. What? Grandpa? Mr. Nonomura! Call an ambulance! Grandpa! Take the car! Get a grip. We have a speed date next week. Mr. Nonomura was hospitalized a few days for tests. "Nonomura" He was forbidden to conduct for a while. Her grandmother was the one who named her "Kazune". Soon after she was born... my wife departed from this world. That was 17 years ago now. When my daughter and her husband took over the store... She said she wanted to play music. I got excited and bought a violin first. She passed away before she ever touched it. So I started playing violin instead. In the times when we grew up... anyone who could play an instrument... had to be from a rich family. But I suppose... it was my dream, too. Mr. Nonomura. I'd be happy to conduct rehearsals until your return. Truly? Yes. Then here. I'm so grateful. I'm so grateful. I'm so grateful. Please don't do that. Okay. Let's start with just the wind instruments. Ready? Okay. Three and... Mr. Kura. Your pitch is a tad low. Think higher. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Three and... Perfection. Close. Now you were a bit high. Once more, okay? - Once more? - Please. Ready, here we go. Three and... Yes, wonderful! I knew you could do it. Perfection. What the heck am I doing? Now let's take it all together from the same place. Ready? Here we go. Maestro. I think you could take it just a little bit slower. Slower? Slower than this? Yes, I think we were going a smidge too fast. I nailed it, right? I think so. I mean, I tried my best. Yeah? If you're not eating that, may I? Sure. I know what's up. As soon as you return, I'm quitting. I've never conducted before. When do you expect to return? That's a matter... for the doctor to decide. At least I'm spared... from learning the digital camera. Huh? If you insist on quitting, I'll just set a trap again. I've been practicing with Tommy. What? They feel no guilt. I'm definitely quitting. I'm quitting! What a great movie! The 3D made it so real and powerful! That rat. You resemble the lead. I do not. You do. I'm not that wild. This is Koichi Osawa. Wow, a Keiwa Academy freshman? Very elite. But a freshman? He's younger than you. So? Is that a problem? Not at all. You go girl. I am Chizuru Koyama. I conduct her grandfather's orchestra. Really? My father has an orchestra, too. The Umegaoka Philharmonic. Ume-Phil's concert master is Osawa. Is that...? Osawa Electric. My dad's company. That means... you're the son of Osawa Electric's CEO and Ume-Phil? Yes. Teacher. Koichi doesn't know anything about my grandpa. But he's... What is it? I had no idea about the Ume-Phil and your grandfather's store. I was never told anything. It's completely understandable. Why would you hear about a lame orchestra... or a small, failing street shop? Kazune. I don't know if it will help... but I'd be happy to listen or talk about it. Nothing would make me happier than being your confidante. My dad did a terrible thing. It doesn't concern us. Incidentally... Ume-Phil doesn't sound like an amateur orchestra. My dad hires a top conductor for the December concert. Really? A French person, I believe. This is he. Lombard? The "Little Giant" conducting Ume-Phil? You're kidding! Who's the "Little Giant"? You've never heard of Lombard? He's a world-class conductor. Hm? "Orchestra Members with Experience Wanted" "1 violin, 1 viola Audition piece: Four Seasons 'Spring'" "Power Engine Music Room: 321,040 yen" "Purchase" "Soundproof Room" "Ume-Phil audition" I'm concert master Osawa. Please. This is where it counts... the hardest part of the piece. I'm rushing the tempo. My bowing is reversed. Thank you. That's enough. Please wait outside. Welcome. Oh, it's you, Teacher. What do you mean? I'm a customer, too. You work here, huh? Drop off your laundry and go. Say, I have some good news. Want to hear it? Do I have a choice? The truth is... I can't honestly say it was a sheer pleasure listening to you. But you did show passion and flavor. You must have practiced a lot. You passed. Hey, I wanted to say that. So? Are you going to cheat on Ume-Sym? I wouldn't call it "cheating". What's the attraction to orchestras? Frankly, as a family member, it's a nuisance. Grandpa says he can't feel the music through headphones. So he blasts it out loud. My parents complain about it all the time. But you seem very willing to help him. If I don't do it... he'll have nobody on his side. Then there's the store. My parents want to close it down. But Grandpa won't allow it. Osawa Electric has offered to buy up the property. Should you be seeing Koichi? None of that matters to us. But Dad... he insists that the time to sell is now. It's like war in my house every day. Your family really seems tied up with Osawa Electric. I hope it has a happy ending. Oh. See you tomorrow. - Evening. - Evening. Done, Kazune? Wait a moment. Ume-Phil's rehearsals were rigorous. Of course, Lombart wasn't there for those. But the trainer was also a top shelf pro. Seconds only... from 79. Third pult only. Okay. Miss Koyama from 74. Stop. Mr. Kura! Don't just come in randomly. Look at the music. I was wrong? Follow the page. Timpani. Don't try to cover with volume. This is supposed to be allargando. Ms. Masa, no eating danishes. - It's custard. - It is. I don't care. Let's play it again. From the top. Three and... Sorry. I have to go. I almost forgot I have a golf game. Lombart's coming? Yes! Pardon me. Lombard is coming to watch rehearsal. What'll I do? This Sunday? What about Ume-Sym practice? Oh. You're right. I can't be at both places. If I don't go, Ume-Sym practice will be canceled. What now? Don't ask me. You're the one playing both sides. You're right. Sorry. You just need conducting? You play piano? Nothing worth demonstrating. But I've never conducted before. That's okay. Nobody even looks at the conductor. Just swing the stick and you'll be fine. I told them I'm attending my sister's wedding so play along. Go ahead. Eat. Miss Koyama. Your bowing is wrong. I'm sorry. How do you like us? Everybody plays so wonderfully. Keep it up. I need you to light a fire under the second violins. Keep it up. I need you to light a fire under the second violins. Hardly. I'm the one who could use their instruction. Instruction? That doesn't happen here. Perhaps you aren't aware of our system. Not every member of Ume-Phil is allowed to perform. Each part has at least one player who can't play on stage. Are you practicing, Miss Koyama? I'm sorry. Miss Koyama, you won't be needed until after the performance. I'll be ready by performance time, I promise. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll do better! I'll play better! I'm sorry! What was that? "Rombart arrives" Sorry. I'll be quick. - Miss Koyama. - I'm ready. We've been pondering this for a while. But we can't have you on stage with Mr. Lombart. I'm very sorry. Lombart. Know any Japanese words? He's even smaller than I thought. But Mr. Lombart is here in Umegaoka! "World-renowned maestro Lombart to conduct local amateur orchestra!" Mr. Lombart! Take our photo. Take our photo! "Osawa Electric CEO, Yoshiko Osawa, 54" I hear you love tempura. Maestro. Maestro! Oh. You're spacing out. Sorry. We've brought you a congratulatory gift. For your sister. Wow, that's big. A fertility charm. It worked for me. Thank you. Why don't we all go celebrate? Get serious! Let's rehearse. This is why people defect to Ume-Phil. Let's begin. Three and... I can actually hear this as "Pomp and Circumstance". Here, it should be allargando. New phrases in tempo primo. They're watching! Following the baton! Wow. That was wonderful. But why all of a sudden? Wait. What did the fill-in teach you? He played the piano. Piano? He played on the piano what we were to play on our instruments. All from memory. Not just piano. He said his flute-playing was not for public ears. So that's how you explain musical composition to these old folks. They hadn't grasped what good music was until now. What's wrong, Maestro. Do you feel ill? No, I'm fine. You don't seem to be yourself. I'm okay. Maestro! Oh no! Are you alright? She's burning up. She's very hot. And now she's crying. It's unlocked. - Teacher? - What the...? Are you dead? Coming in! Wait, wait, wait. Hold it! You're alive. What's this? A sauna? How do you get through? Under the table? Hilarious. Look, I didn't ask you to come here. So please go home. Are you sure? What if I've brought happy news? What happy news? Pardon me. Wait! Don't come in! What is that? Shut your mouth! This way, Teacher. I'm entering. What is this? Pardon the intrusion. You gotta crawl under the table. Under? Looks great. This is fabulous. I'm so glad. No, really. I'm not just saying that. I love housework. You made the pudding, too? Yes. I like to cook, especially sweets. Yum! What a relief. Wow. I'll do the dishes. No need... well, okay. Sorry to make you crawl. No, this is fun. Very fun. Don't be weird. Take care. Get well. Thanks for everything. I hear practice is going well. Um... I don't want to surprise you and have it affect your health, but... I'd like to quit the orchestra after all. I'm sorry. I see. I accept. It was unfair of me to expect a young woman... like yourself to stick around. But I decided to try anyway... because that orchestra had been a dream of mine. Are you joining Ume-Phil, then? No. I'm quitting music. I realized my limitations. But I'm okay with that. Maestro. I can no longer... serve as conductor. At my age, even surgery won't help. It's not just conducting. I'm forbidden from having any performance from here on out. Even if I wanted to. But you say you won't despite the fact that you can. If you don't do it now... I'm afraid... you'll wish you had later. Huh? Lombart? (In French) (In French) (In French) It's appears to be the condenser. I like to keep parts from old, discarded appliances. This will work. Okay then. Let's try it. There, it's alive. Your whiskers... what? Your whiskers... Your whiskers tickle. Hearing music on this player my dad bought me... I feel the passion of youth return. This cassette radio is essential to me. The electric shop president gave me the latest player... and said this was not worth repairing. He couldn't understand my music. How much do I owe you? 10 squid legs and... Be serious. I do it as a service. I can't charge you. You're a professional. You must get paid. In that case, 100 yen would be fine. Ah! Wait a second. Hold on. Actually, we're looking for a conductor. Any recommendations? If possible, a patient and kind Japanese. Someone who can explain things in a simple, straightforward way. I'll do what I can. And I'll conduct the performance. What? You, Maestro Lombart? No, no. Our orchestra is very, very bad and incomplete. And we have no plans to perform. Not a problem. Mr. Nonomura. Can you believe this? Maestro Lombart. I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I must decline. What? But why? We already have the perfect conductor. Excuse me? That's you. Mr. Nonomura, a word. Mr. Lombart is offering to conduct. Why bring me up? That's crazy. Plus, I quit. I didn't agree. Don't be rude. Are you a conductor? Absolutely not. She's giving up on music... and wants to quit our group and the Ume-Phil. Ume-Phil? You. Know any Japanese words? Ugh. That orchestra is nonsense. I often wish I could return to my amateur days. That's where the enjoyment is purest. Their method made you want to quit. Precisely why... I can't approve of your conducting our orchestra, Maestro Lombart. We have members who have been around for a very long time. The only one who can lead them... is our very own conductor. You're so right. I was wrong. So there you have it. I entrust Ume-Sym into your capable hands. That is best. Just quit Ume-Phil. Like me. I quit Ume-Phil too! Quit Ume-Phil? You can't do that. I'm a conductor, not their promoter. I just want to make music. What do I really want to do? The answer came quickly. I quit Ume-Phil and devoted myself to Ume-Sym conductor. "First tempo: fast, then easy" To the end? We did it! The whole piece! Perfect, Mr. Kura! Thanks! Look, I made this just for the occasion. Sorry, what does this say? "Members Wanted for the Umegaoka Symphony Orchestra" "Inquire for interview at Nonomura Radio Shop" What's wrong, Koichi? Let me join Ume-Sym. Well sure, but... - Your dad. - He's of no concern. You're looking for new members. Heck, this is so much fun! Join, join! Thank you. From the side, you look just like Karajan. Want to try my pickles? Eat pickles later. Koichi, you sit here, then. Let's take it from the top. Ready? Okay? Three and... A concert? At long last, you've taken them to that point. Yes. I have much to ask you. By all means. Ask away. If you decide it, I approve. A concert. May I have your attention! Listen up! Umegaoka Symphony Orchestra... it's time to give a concert. What? Bravo! Quiet! It's too soon for "bravos". Nothing has begun yet. Listen carefully. The success of a concert hinges on the choice of music. So let me hear your views, and let's choose a piece. Yes, Tommy! Beethoven's "9th". You're shooting too high. Mozart! "Symphony No. 40!" Full of melancholy. There's no trumpet part. What? Really? Forget it. Maestro! Master Builder! "The Inextinguishable"! How does that go? You don't know that wonderful piece? - I do. It's Nielsen. - Exactly. Timpani glissando. Exactly! Definitely not. Debussy's "Syrinx". It's quite short. It's 3 minutes of flute solo. That's all. We don't choose on the basis of solos. Maestro. Just once in my life, I'd like... to play a glissando. I could go at any time. This could be my last chance at it. Stop, Master Builder. You're bringing down the mood. Stop your crying. In the distant mountains, the sun sets. Stars in the sky. Dvorak? "New World", 2nd movement. Yes. I absolutely adore that piece. Let's do it, then. Actually, the piece I prepared... was this! "From the New World" So "Pomp and Circumstance" and "From the New World"? Yes, and we'll finish with the 9th. Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9". Please be quiet. "Kura Sushi" Maestro Lombart! Chizuru! Hi there! But what brings you here? I'm not sure but he appeared, so I brought him. I'm sorry, I don't understand. What about your interpreter? I was very moved. He cut short his tour in Hong Kong to come see your rehearsal. He cut short his tour in Hong Kong to come see your rehearsal. Wow, Mr. Sakashita. You've learned French. I called only an hour ago. I took some French in college, actually. But you're amazing, Miss Koyama. Are you kidding? Look at you, Mr. Sakashita. It's nothing. I can only speak a little. Looks like a match! Stop, Tommy. It's not like that. Mr. Kura. Sorry I'm late. Are you well, Nonomura? I'm great. Look. Who's the shorty? He's no shorty. That's Mr. Lombart. He is?! How do you do? Let's get ready, folks. I forgot my B flat. Can I borrow that? Again? Make sure your return it. Hurry. Hold it. Move out of the way. Here. Return it, okay? Radish? That's his specialty. What? I'll compose a song for him. For Mr. Kura? The world's first radish piece. What? Thank you! "1st Annual Concert 'Radish Concerto' by Phillip Lombart" It's off kilter. "Hi! We're the Umegaoka Symphony Orchestra!" I think the map should be a little bigger. You're right. Old guys have bad eyes. So did you invite him properly? Who? Mr. Sakashita. That's none of your business, right? You're older, so you have to take the initiative. Is that a thing? Whatever. Stay out of it. I'll see ya. What? That girl. "Master Builder" Hello? What's up, Toryo? We can't seat everybody that wants tickets! "Umegaoka Large Music Hall" What's wrong? Feeling woozy again? Are you ill? No, I was just lost in thought. Wondering what to wear at the concert. Is that all? Don't scare us like that! Come on! You needn't worry about that, Chizuru. Right? Okay. Let's see now. Trumpets were late. Let's take a break, and then play it one more time. Take five. "Kazune, 19 calls" Whoa. What? I don't have time for romance counseling. It's grandpa! Mr. Nonomura. Kazune. What are you doing here, Son? I should ask the same of you, Father. What's going on? It's not for sale. "Real Estate Sales Contract" I said I won't sell and I mean it. And even if I did, I'd never sell to him. Father, please. You have no customers. Why continue? We have customers. Excuse me! See? Yes. We've got business, so go home. Where is Osawa Electric? Go straight and you can't miss it. The sign is very big. Thank you. I refuse to lose to you. Not my store, nor my orchestra. Both have one foot in the grave. What did you just say? I ought to... strangle you... Father! Father? Dear, come quick! Papa! Papa! Father! Ambulance! Mr. Nonomura. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kazune. You apologize properly too, Dad! Apologize! Koichi. Please leave. Go home. Let's go. Come. What's his condition? Grandpa... needs surgery. But... considering his age... it could be difficult. Yo, Maestro. Hello. Good afternoon. Hi, how are you? Look who's here already! I'm relieved. The doctor was surprised at how well you handled the surgery. It's all thanks to this. Kazune played this during the operation. What surprised me... was learning that Osawa had a son like Koichi. He's a really good kid. This hit him hard, and he's been trying to find ways to help. He helped with the orchestra, and then he joined. But then his father found out. Practically disowned him. Poor thing. It's not his fault. This is between me and Osawa. It doesn't involve those kids. Mr. Nonomura. Mr. Nonomura! What? Oh, you scared me. For a second, I thought... my heart would fail. Sorry. I got lost in thought momentarily. Thank God. What were you thinking about? Maybe it's time to close up the shop. But don't you remember how happy you made Mr. Lombart? People like you are still in demand. No, most customers these days... just want the latest thing at the cheapest price possible. I can't blame them. There's nothing wrong with that. Such are the times we live in. Maestro. Yes? Maybe I'll ask you to put me in upcoming performance, too. What? I don't know. You're the conductor, of course. I was thinking I'd pick up the violin again. I won't cause trouble. But your heart. Don't worry. I promised not to overdo it. I got the doctor to sign off on my just playing the violin. I have to make the most of the life that I just got back, and enjoy it. Just take care of me if something does go wrong, all right? Understood. In that case, let's get you ready. No mercy. Okay. This was our last rehearsal. Tomorrow, we play a concert at last. Mr. Nonomura. Your technique, quite honestly, could still use some work. But there's something in the way you play that melody... that the rest of of the orchestra doesn't quite attain. Perhaps it's the history that Mr. Nonomura has lived. But it seems like life itself is resonating in the music. It has love. I thought that once I became an adult... I wouldn't have room to progress. I thought of giving music up on many occasions. I would get depressed... and would just want to quit over and over. But at times like that... I'd see your faces. And that was all the encouragement I needed to push on. No, you've got it all backwards. What? We only worked hard because we saw how hard you were working. That's right. You're the reason a bunch of old fogies like us made it this far. It's true. Thank you. That's right! Bravo! Bravo! We want you to wear this tomorrow. It's old but we had it re-altered. Was it bad timing to ask you out on the eve of the concert? No, not at all. Everyone said they'd be in bed by 7 to be rested for tomorrow. Seven? That early! I agree. That's taking it a bit too far. This is for you. What? Open it. Would you wear it tomorrow? Oh! Thank you. I had a dream back in school, too. But I abandoned it when I realized I wasn't made for it. So seeing you so passionately pursuing something you love... is incredibly radiant. I'm not really sure why, but... things like work or romance... rarely seem to go as planned. But if you have a passion for something... you don't mind giving your all for it. That's what those people have taught me. You're staring. I'm sorry. Miss Koyama? I'm 23 years old. Is that still okay? No. Age makes no difference at all. In fact, it seems just about right. It's just about right? It is. Well then. Yes. To our meeting. It's huge. Maestro! Oh, that looks marvelous on you! Well perhaps... we made it a little small. Sorry. No, it's the best tailcoat ever. Isn't it a little early to be getting dressed up? I kind of jumped the gun. Maestro, relax. Relax. That's right, relax. You do the same. Okay, raise the sign! "Umegaoka Symphony Orchestra's 1st Annual Concert" How'd it go last night? Not telling. We could be going out. Really? Congratulations! Maybe, but not sure yet. Okay? Going out where? Nowhere. Nothing. Take a look! Going where? I forgot my shirt and necktie. Lend me yours, Kura. Not a chance. Why? This is all I've got on. I'll stick out in this. It's okay. Your face stands out more. Don't say that. I'm panicking here. Anyone bring an extra shirt? Mr. Lombart! Chizuru. Go out and have a blast. Do you mind if I record it with this? Not at all. Right? Of course. Shall I give it a check up? You look great. Thanks. I always carry it like a lucky charm. You won't believe the people! There's a huge crowd out there! Hello! Bonjour! The place is packed! Thanks to the world debut of Mr. Lombart's original piece. Did you see all the people? Pardon me. Mr. Lombart! Shake my hand! We're opening the hall. All together, I see. Miss Koyama, was it? The one who quit the Ume-Phil. I look forward to seeing what you can do. It's good to see you well, Mr. Nonomura. No collapsing this time. Mr. Lombart. I certainly hope your "radish concerto" doesn't spoil. Shall we? Usher him to the guest seat. Ms. Koyama... You've got this. Okay. The house... is full of people. Okay. What's the matter? Forgot the music. Me, too. Got it? I'm fine. Move along, please. Mr. Nonomura. Let's enjoy this. I already am. Right. Perfect without doubt! Such fun! How's the heart? Nothing beats doing what you love! Totally! Power's out? Maybe. Your attention. Lightning has caused a complete electrical outage. Can you restore it? It'll take some time. Guests, please make your way carefully to the lobby. Wait please! Mr. Nonomura, do you have your driver? Yes, but what do you plan to do? Let me see it. Well everyone, are you ready? You bet we are. There was no hesitating. The had all memorized the music. We'd practiced it so much. And everyone was proud that they'd spared no effort. That's how we go this far! This is us! Ume-Sym! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! "Ume-Phil Plays Pomp and Circumstan in the dark" "Osawa Electric" "Nonomura Radio Shop We fix old stuff" There we go! - And him! - Okay let's go. Miss Koyama. I've made up my mind! Miss Koyama? Yes? I'm going to France. France? I like sweets. I love them, in fact. But I gave up on my dream of becoming a patissier. Sweets? A pa-patissier? I'm sorry, what? At age 23, it's not too late, right? I'll do my best. Thank you, Miss Koyama! See you. She's grown much more powerful. As if driven by the devil. Well, of course. I heard an interesting story from Kazune. It seems... Mr. Nonomura! Yes!
