Hello, everyone. I'm Mark Polonia, and I'd like to welcome you to this first-ever release of "Church of the Damned." Now, a little bit of history is required here. Our first real shot-on-video feature was "Splatter Farm." But we have to go back two more movies, this being one of them. Prior to that, we made "Hallucinations." It was a 65-minute real nightmarish quality feature shot on video that may end up getting released through this series. But before that, our first foray into video and our attempt to make a feature was this one you're going to watch... "Church of the Damned." "Church of the Damned" was inspired by the wave of shot-on-video movies that were coming out at the time. Now keep in mind, we were still in high school at the time this was made. In fact, we started shooting this over Christmas break in 12th grade. We had just come out of a Super 8 film background. So the way we shot this film was sort of counterproductive to actually editing it later, because we had no means or no understanding at that time of how to edit video. It was that new. So we tried to shoot a lot of things in camera and save ourselves editing, which did not work. We ultimately realized halfway through the shoot that it did not work. "Church of the Damned" really was never officially finished. We dropped the project for various reasons, went right into "Hallucinations" to give it another try, something a little more focused. And you'll see what I mean when you watch this. In this movie, there's no women, which explains our dating situation at the time in high school. We're trying to play cops. When you watch it, we look like kids. If we were making a sequel to "Emil and the Detectives," that Walt Disney program, it might have passed. But we did what we could with what we had. And we tried to reach beyond what most people were doing at the time... Shot-on-video stuff... What little we knew of it. And you know, it just doesn't work. We look like what we are... A bunch of high school kids. However, the movie does have some concrete things in it. It's got a couple really good set pieces. Once I edited this together, I was surprised at having just jumped into the medium of VHS that we did have a mastery of how to put a movie together. That wasn't the case. The case was our struggle with this new technology. I remember the first scene we shot with this, which is the kid getting killed who's in the kitchen. John ran outside... we were going to go outside and shoot... slips on the ice. Bam, the camera hits the ground. I thought, it's all over. Fortunately, it was a pretty rugged camera. We used it to shoot this, "Hallucination," "Splatter Farm," and one other movie, I think. But nonetheless, it was a constant struggle. Lighting was different. It was nice to actually be able to shoot something, and have the sound come out and be there, and not have to re-dub it. That was fantastic. The camera had limitations. You couldn't control the iris. There were no f-stops on it. There were no filters. You basically had a manual and an automatic focus. That was it. And a zoom button, which we abused regularly throughout the shooting. Having said that, watching it now that I put it together, it's not as bad as I would've thought it was. I wish we would have finished it. And we really only had to shoot, like, two or three scenes to finish up the movie. We gave up on it, probably just because of the frustration of trying to shoot it on video. But having not learned anything, we jumped right into "Hallucinations" and then "Splatter Farm." And the rest is history. So it was a real good catalyst. And I'm actually excited to have this come out and have people see it... The real seeds, the beginnings of what we kind of pioneered from here forward. I do remember a couple things about the shoot. It was always gloomy out. It was always cold. And it snowed, and it snowed, and it snowed. A lot of the movie took place outside. And I remember, it was just a miserable time... Freezing cold. We're in blazers and jackets... Still wasn't enough. If it wasn't snowing, it was raining and just freezing. We were always cold making this picture, and that's one thing that stands out. The other thing that stands out is how much fun it was. As much work as it was and as much experimentation that it was, it really was fun. We got to do a lot of different things as far as makeup effects go. Yeah, it was a much longer story than we had ever made before. I believe the original title of this was called "Fallen Angel," and then we kind of whittled it down. Todd Smith came up with the original idea. And then I think we sat down, brainstormed, and typed... I typed the script with a typewriter because that's all we had. And I don't know where the script went. I know years ago I saw it somewhere, but it probably got pitched out. It was quite involved, lots of dialogue, and just a good time. Looking back, I remember how free you are at that time to just go out and shoot a feature. When you're in high school, all that mattered were girls and making movies. And we made lots of movies, so it was a fun time. And I'm proud to have this presentation here for you. [creepy music] [non-english singing] [creepy music] [grunting] Fuckhead. Ah! [snap] [creepy music] Who's there? I said, who's there? [creepy music] [shouting] [non-english singing] [music playing] [creepy music] [shouting] What's wrong? Is it my beans? Chill out. The winds kind of funny, though. Farmer Sam had a few cows mutilated a few days back. Yeah. And what did it? GUY 1: Report said wolves done it. GUY 2: Wolves my ass. That damn city cop they brought in don't know his ass from a hole in the ground. Messiah Ward's a good man. Maybe a good man, but definitely stupid. Those weren't wolves. Those were devil worshippers. GUY 1: What the hell are you talking about? GUY 2: Brotherhood of Darkness in that old church near the rundown cemetery. Some folks even seen people coming out of there lately... Weird people and noises. It's them, all right. Just can feel it. They found the traitor it all began. GUY 1: Really? Then what happened next? Well, the comments began, and then some even weirder happened. Even weirder? GUY 2: Then they put him in a coffin. I guess they were the ones responsible. I don't. It's nonsense. They may hear you. Grow up. [creepy music] Why don't you stop being silly? Come over here and help. [growl] [evil laugh] [groan] [gunshot] [evil laugh] [suspenseful music] [growl] [phone ringing] Hello. Yeah, who is it? Hello, Frank. What's up? The only time you call me is when something really messy turns out. Two murders? Where? Yeah. OK. Yeah. OK. OK. Up the old Cali Road, three miles? OK, thanks. I'll get right to it. Great way to start the day. [non-english singing] Come here, captain. What for? Possible evidence. Let's not get excited. Could be one of those flatlanders' piece of debris. I'll do a rundown on the damn thing when we get back to the office. Good for a part-timer. Let's go. Paramedics will finish up here. [heavy breathing] You fools! [non-english singing] The police have grabbed one of the medallions of the Brotherhood! You'll will all be struck down by Ismodus for this foolish act. You, watch this Messiah Ward. Don't let him out of your sight! Bring that medallion back, or you shall hang besides Thomas! Nothing must stand in our way... Nothing. We must get that medallion back. We must! You said the customs department couldn't track the identity of this medallion anywhere? That's right. What the hell is it? Some kind of strange writing on here. I can't make it out. I don't know, but here's the missing persons report you asked for. Thanks. Now let's get started. [creepy music] [shouting] [evil laugh] Who's there? Who's there? [creepy music] [growl] Hey, you! What the hell? Come here. Who are you? Get the hell out of my barn, asshole. [growl] [shout] [evil laugh] [sizzle] [shout] [evil laugh] [growl] [shouting] [non-english singing] [creepy music] The ritual massacre is going well! Soon we will have the medallion and a very nosy cop. All this we owe to Brother Thomas. [evil laugh] Hi, Ward. Hi, Barney. Figured out what the hell that is yet? Not one of them knows what this thing means, unless... Unless the murderers that would wear this belong to some kind of group that would use this for a symbol. You're saying murderers in the plural? That's correct. How can you be so sure? Well, let's take the evidence. [creepy music] You have a kid sawed in half, a severed head in the refrigerator, two butchered campers. I won't even repeat how they died. What teenage campers? One's in the coroner's office. Found him about 6:00 this morning. What a mess... two couples. Christ, the situation keeps getting worse and worse. Every day, more people die. Exactly. And this is our [muted] clue. The way I figure it, there have to be more than one murderer. You just don't kill two couples without some sort of a struggle. Surely don't just let someone do that to you without putting up a struggle. But who would do this group killing? Sounds like some sort of bizarre cult. Hey, I'll go down to the library and check out some books, see if I can find anything of value. [creepy music] Good job. You found something. Not only that, but I found a lot of things. I think this is the answer right here. My god. This is it. Brotherhoods of Darkness, history of the death cult. It's them. It's got to be them. This book is full of facts. We can build a really strong case. Let's read first, find out what we're dealing with. Oh. The Legion of Brotherhood and the Disciples of Satan. Satan? Sounds like we've got some devil worshippers on our hands. Swell. BARNEY: Go on. Frequent sacrifices are offered to the great one consisting of animals and innocents of God. The dark one saith that one who commits thou deed of death serves thy master fully. [creepy music] [non-english singing] The prophecy is true. We are degenerating. What is it? One of our members was taken during the camp slaying. Have you brought the body back? Yes, it has been done. Look at us. We only have a few more days. We must have more raids. Send out the entire flock. The Brotherhoods of Darkness must survive. Do you understand? Thou shalt serve the master and do his bidding. The ritual of massacre will bring a new tomorrow. Our time shall soon arrive on the wings of a fiery demon! You will again be with us, Father Jonathan. Brother Thomas has paid for his sins. Right. There's sacrifices to the master. That would explain all this mayhem. Hell, the papers would have a field day with this. Question is, how many people have they already gotten this very day? Experienced. Look at this... A church, place where they worship. I don't recognize it. Me neither. This is I do recognize. What? [creepy music] WARD: The house of Jonathan. Are you familiar with this man? He's been arrested so many times it isn't even funny. For what? Even attempt to murder his wife, which I think he was guilty of. Wasn't even found guilty. I have an idea. What do you say we pay a visit to the house of Father Jonathan? It's about time we crack this case open. [creepy music] [groan] Vinny! Vinny! Where are you? Where'd you go? Vinny! Come on! I'm over here! [creepy music] [shout] [groan] [crunch] [non-english singing] WARD: Hey, that's a for-sale sign. I thought you said he still lived here. BARNEY: Last I knew of, he did. Hey, ain't this breaking and entering? Let's just just call it police business. If that guy comes in and finds us... Then we'll arrest him. You take that side, and I'll take this side. All right. We'll meet at the end of the hall. [creepy music] [laugh] [creepy music] Nothing here. Same here. I'll check out the cellar. I'll go check the upstairs. [creepy music] What's behind the door? [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [creepy music] [shout] Ward. [growl] [creepy music] Where's the medallion? Aw, Barney. Give me the medallion. No, Ward. Don't give it to him. Give it to me or die. [muted] You have what you want. Kill him. No! [shouting] Damn! BARNEY: You all right? Yeah. This is fucking weird. Coroner's gonna shit when he sees this. This whole night's been a disaster. Not really. Now we finally have some concrete evidence. What, the stiff? No. This. A map? What is it? Possibly that church in that book. I'm sure if we go over the evidence again, we can locate it. Come on, Ward. Let's get the hell out of here. [creepy music] [non-english singing] The time is approaching. In a few more hours, this very night, our leader shall rise from his coma state and again help us battle that God of the Earth! It is written on the parchment bound in human flesh that we must take the life of an elder. But there is a place that I know of, and it is here that we shall fulfill the ritual of massacre. And our lord shall send us our beloved brother Jonathan to restore us and make us powerful! Now we must give thanks unto our lord and give him prayer and forgiveness, for we now hold the key to eternal damnation of this Earth that will make the Brotherhoods of darkest stronger in body and in soul! Ah! [laugh] Here you go. BARNEY: Oh, thanks, Ward. Find anything yet? Oh, yes. I've looked through the book and the map. Found a few things in here. Well, if I knew what language these were written in, I'd had news a long time ago. That I know. Now tell me something I don't know. These are mines in the backs. Then look at this. That's a symbol for all the mines. That's it. BARNEY: The only mines located around here are in the Blackwoods. Shouldn't that be where the church is? WARD: Great. Let's go nab 'em. [muted] take a backup patrol? Who said anything about an arrest? What are you talking about? These murderers don't deserve a fair trial, where they can get away with anything. Sometimes a person has to do what he has to do. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, we're going to save the taxpayers a little money. Good. By the way, you had several calls while you were out. The coroner called. Then your mother called. What did she want? I don't know, but the coroner said you were supposed to get your ass down there as soon as possible. Did he do an autopsy yet? That's just it. He wouldn't touch it, sounded drunk. One look at that would jar anybody's nerves. We've got a lot to do. Grab the book. We'll go get a bite to eat before we see the coroner. It is time [muted] will be fulfilled. [non-english singing] We will take the life of an elder. All rise and come forth to choose the weapon of your fiery destiny. Come forth and receive. ALL: [chanting] CORONER: Look at this. There it is. There we go. Jesus Christ. Is this your boy? Yeah, it might just be. It was like this when we killed it. That's OK. CORONER: There we go. Find anything? CORONER: Everything looks fine. Liver. Now comes the fun part. Now, that wasn't so bad, was it, Barney? CORONER: OK, we'll cover this [muted].. [creepy music] [suspenseful music] Mother of God! My God! [gunshot] That's mighty fine shooting you did, Ward. Thanks. The church is down here a few miles. Take the next turn. Hey, you missed a turn. No, I didn't. Just where are we going? To see Ma. [non-english singing] [creepy music] Well, McGuire, Did you get my call? Yeah, Ma. Oh, excuse me. This is Barney. Hello. Hello, ma'am. He's my new partner. Can we come in for a while? Why, of course. [suspenseful music] Is all this you say true? Afraid so, ma'am. Devil worshippers, Brotherhoods of Darkness, it it's all so awful, just like all those murders. That's why we want you to be especially careful. Well, if any of them fruit loops step foot on this property, they's gonna get an ass-full of buckshot. Just be careful. OK, Ma? I can take care of myself. I know, Ma. We'll see you later. Buh-bye. [creepy music] We'll be back later. OK, Ma? Goodbye. See you, ma'am. Now we got to find that church. [creepy music] [growl] ALL: [snarl] [bangs] [growls] I haven't begun yet. I will destroy you by the powers of hell! But first, you are truly ours! [growl] [shout] [growl] [creepy music] [growl] [shouts] [bangs] [suspenseful music] [snarl] Damn you! [growl] I smell you! [growl] [shout] You haven't won yet! [shouts] [shout] [shout] [suspenseful music] [shout] I don't have the rage! [shout] [dramatic music] Come on. Come on. [snarl] [scream] [shout] [snarl] [scream] [snarl] [scream] You son of a bitch! I'm gonna bash your fucking face in! [scream] Now I'm going to tear your heart out [groans] How's it feel? [creepy music] DEMON: [groans] [growl] [creepy music] I'm tired of you. [snarl] [groan] [creepy music] [growl] Now you're going to fly across the room like an angel. [snarl] Good wins over evil! DEMON: [screams] [dramatic music]
