Can you stay the whole night? Can you do that? Yeah, if that's what you want then I can do that. Yes. That's what I want. Done. Now, once I get the money I can call in and we can get started. How much? 4,000. $4,000? For the night? Yes. Oh, I didn't anticipate it would be that much. I'm assuming cash only? Uh-huh. I only have like $3,000 on me. There's an ATM downstairs. I can wait. Can I pay you the rest in the morning? Payment has to be in full, up front. Right. Ok. How about if I pay you like, you know, a late charge fee? Rules are rules. Oh, come on. I'm not gonna rip you off. Hey, either you pay up or I'm outta here. Ok. That's understandable. Um, hear me out. How about this? I will give you the $3,000 and I'll give you this watch for, you know, collateral. You hang on to it and tomorrow morning I give you the rest of the money. It's worth a lot more than $1,000. Trust me. Look at it. It's real. Nikki, don't make me go downstairs. The girl at the front desk saw me there ten minutes ago and if I go down to an ATM and I take out a whack of cash it's gonna look... you know. Please? Pretty please? Plus an extra hundred? Deal. Fine. And the $3,000. Yeah. Well, yeah. Of course. You better not try and stiff me or we're gonna have a real problem. You got that? I would never do that. This is 32. Well, let's consider it a tip. Thank you. I'm here at the hotel. Yeah, I'll be here all night. Uh-huh. Bye. Um, can I get you something? A drink would be lovely. Great. How about what I'm having? I'll have a vodka neat. Oh, I don't think I have vodka. There's none over there? Uh, vodka. Will this do? That will be lovely. My god. They've got M&M's here for seven bucks. You can get them for a $1.50 anywhere else.

Commercial, mostly. How's that going? Things have gone in my favour lately. That must be nice. Cheers. Yeah. How old are you? 21. How old are you? 21. Not your work age. What's your real age? That is my real age. What year were you born? 199... 6. Alright. I get it. It's probably better for business if you say you're 21. I was just asking. It's not like I'm gonna kick you out if you tell me you're 30. What's it to you? I don't know. Just curious. Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age? You're right. If you say you're 20 then you're 20. 21. If you say you're 21, then you're 21. I'm 24. Oh. Well, 24 is a great age. Actually, I just turned 26 last week. Get the fuck outta my room! I'm just joking. 26 is a great age, ok? It's way better than 21. It doesn't feel like it. No, it is. You're in your prime, the golden years. It's downhill after that, trust me. Yay. How old are you? 21. Is that right? Times two. Eww. And a bunch more years. Well, you know what they say, 40's are the new 30's. Well, that would be mildly comforting if I was in my 40's. I turned 50 this year. That's exciting. No, it's not. It's horrifying. Want another drink? I'm still working on this. What time is it? I think a little after midnight. Am I at the beginning of your shift or the end? Somewhere in the middle. Did you have someone before me? Just one other. Was he good looking? He was cute. Cuter than me? Not even close. He was cute in a boyish kinda way. He was so nervous, though. It was over before it even started, if you catch my drift. I tried to console him but I think I just made it worse so I got up and I left. Oh, that's too bad. For him or for me? You been doing this a while? A little over six years. Wow. You started young. I bet you seen some things. I sure have. What's the weirdest thing that a customer or client? Client. What's the weirdest thing a client's ever asked you to do? Weirdest? Um... Or, you don't have to answer that if you don't want to. Oh, no. Well... I had this one guy, he had me put on these clothes. They were just regular jeans, a shirt, whatever. And he held me and he cried all night. Just sobbed into my chest. Then I found out the clothes belonged to his daughter who had recently been murdered by her ex-boyfriend. Holy fuck, that's heavy. Poor guy. He didn't wanna have sex, did he? Oh, no, no! Woah, that would have been so weird. Right. There's no way I would go along with that stuff now, it's too exhausting. When I first started I was too scared to say no to people because I- I thought they'd get mad or- I don't know. I've got a weird one for you. Ok, I once had this client, an older guy, even older than you if you if you can believe it. I can't, but go ahead. He must have been in his 60's. Anyways, his thing was he wanted to be a dog. A dog? Yeah, like woof woof, a dog. He got naked and he put on these fake dog ears and he had a tail and he was barking and panting. It was full-on. And it wasn't some kinky sex thing, either. He just straight up wanted to be a dog. That's it. How long did this go on? I don't know, like six hours, maybe longer. And what did you do? Uh, I fed him. Real dog food, by the way. His idea, not mine. My god. Uh, I scratched his belly, we played fetch for a bit. Then I think I just got bored and I fell asleep on the couch watching TV. When I woke up he was curled up next to me on the floor, sleeping. So yeah, I guess that was maybe the weirdest thing. But it was also kinda sweet. Like, I was never freaked out by him or anything. This poor guy probably just wants an escape from his real life and wants to be a dog for a few hours. Like, he's not hurting anyone. Did you ever see him again? No, but I've heard he's done this to a few other girls around town. I guess I wasn't a very good dog-sitter. Oh, wow! Um, here. You ok? Yeah. Thank you. That was impressive. Would you like another drink? No, thank you. Oh, come on. It's lonesome drinking alone. Then don't drink. That's even more lonesome. Do you want anything else? Maybe a soda pop? Juice? No. I'm good. I'm gonna use the ladies. ♪ Tired eyes bitter cold, ♪ ♪ Dragging on has gotten old ♪ Prayers for night to come to close, ♪ ♪ Seems like time is just folding on itself, ♪ ♪ Seems like time is just folding on itself, ♪ ♪ Winter's here taking hold, ♪ ♪ Thoughts of you I can't repose ♪ Are you allowed to smoke in here?

Open the door- open the goddamn door! Leave her alone! When did she get a lock on her door? A couple weeks ago. And you let her? I didn't let her, she did it herself! What's the matter with you? Tracy, open this door right now! Jim! Stop! Tracy, I'm giving you three seconds to open this fucking door! Will you calm down? ...Go by yourself! Tracy! Open the god... Jim, what're you doing?! What song is that? Hmm? What song are you humming? Oh, you like it? It's by this local singer, Anton Gail. You've probably never heard of him, he's not famous or anything. But I um... I saw him play at a club a couple of weeks ago and I bought his album and I've just been totally obsessed with it. Especially that one song, I just can't get it out of my head. It's been playing over and over on a loop. I have it on my phone, I can play it for you if you like. Uh, maybe later. Ok. Can I have a drag of that? I thought you only smoked occasionally. Well, tonight's become one of those occasions. I like the way you smoke. The way I smoke? What do you mean? Yeah. You know, like a lot of women, well, men too, they... they make smoking seem trashy but you, you make it look elegant. You're making me self-conscious. That's not to encourage you to smoke, by the way. You should quit. I know. I've been trying to quit, it's just- after so long it becomes kind of part of your identity. How long have you been smoking? I started when I was 14, so what's that? Fourteen years old? Yeah, I don't waste any time. How do you even get cigarettes at that age? I had an older boyfriend, so you know. Well, and my mom's boyfriend used to leave packs of smokes lying around and I'd sneak a few here or there and he wouldn't notice. Or if he did he didn't say anything. But when I first started I wasn't even inhaling. I was just puffing on them to look cool. So I guess I didn't really start smoking until the summer going into grade 11 when I started smoking weed. Speaking of which, do you want to smoke a joint? Do you have some? 'Cause if you have some I think I'll smoke some. Oh, I sure do. You don't smoke weed much, do you? Uh, no. Uh, I can't even tell you the last time I smoked. Wow. By the way, you look good smoking, too. No, you do. You look- you look really cool and tough. Mmm. I hate it, you know, when like sissies, they're like afraid of their cigarettes. Do you know what I mean? Like, I like it when a man has a firm grip on it like it's his and no one can take it from him. Why are you laughing? Oh, nothing. What? Oh, you just reminded me of something. Ok, so tell me. My wife- well, my ex-wife... Mmmhmm. She was jealous of my smoking. Ok. Yeah. She used to say that I had more passion when I smoked than when I kissed her. Yeah. In fact, one time she said, in a snarky tone, "I wish that you would smoke me like you smoke that cigarette". What the fuck does that mean? It beats me. Oh, I know. Maybe that was her subtle way of asking you for a rim job 'cause she was too embarrassed to ask you straight up. Oh my god. Can you imagine? Yeah. My marriage could have been saved if I had eaten some butt. Yeah. Uh, no. You finish it. Ok. Well. Holy cow. You know what we should do? What? We should eat some of those chocolates. Oh, you're wasted. And I am in the mood for some expensive chocolate. No. Yes. We are gonna do it. But they're so expensive. I don't care. We're gonna eat 'em. Ok. Alright, so we got um, M&M's, we got KitKat, we got Aero, and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Are you insane? I thought you just wanted M&M's. Ok, alright. Well, what about M&M's and one more? Sure. M&M's and KitKat? Reese's. Oh, good choice. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups it is! Oh. Oh. Ok. Here we go. So come on, Tracy. Come eat these with me. Ugh. I am gonna get fat because of you. Hey, do you mind that I called you Tracy just now? No, you can call me Tracy. I don't mind. Ok. Oh yeah. Good call on the chocolate. Oh man, these are good. Oh my god. I don't remember it tasting this good. I think maybe- Uh-huh. The could be this good because they are so fuckin' expensive. That's what I thought, too! Mmmhmm. Or just 'cause we're super baked. Oh yeah, right. Mmm. Wow. Mmm. Oh my god. My face is numb. Oh, woah. I- I don't think I can even feel my face. Your eyes are half closed. Are they really? Yeah. How about now? They're the same. Now? No different. Fuck it. Uh-huh. Oh, so good. Mmm. Ok, I'll switch you. I want a Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Yeah, I mean, you better finish the last one before I eat them all. Mmm. Oh. Peanut butter and chocolate. That's always a good combination. Where are you going? I have sticky fingers. I hate sticky fingers. Tracy, I'm giving you three seconds to open this fucking door! Will you calm down?! Stop it, just go by yourself! Tracy, open the goddamn door! Jim, what're you doing?! Stop! What're you doing?! Open the door! Are you crazy?! No! Call an ambulance! Oh my god. Listen to me. You need to call an ambulance, Anna. Now! Is she dead? Aaaargh! Look at- just look at me! Go and call an ambulance, please. Ok. Ok, baby. Ok. Ok. Breathe. Are you ok? Daddy's here.

What day is it today? Thursday, the 10th. Yeah, I could do tonight. Dinner? Dinner is good. How about 8 o'clock? 8 o'clock. Um, is there anything in particular you wanna eat? You- you can pick the place. My treat. Alright. I'll text you the address. We'll meet there at 8:00. Great. See you tonight. Bye. It's ok. Here we go. Top. Uh-huh. Ok, almost- almost done. Ok, we're gonna rinse. Chin up. There. Oh. What is it? When'd you get this? It's white. You look thin. Are you eating? Yes. Anna feeding you properly? She is. You kids eat out too much. You have to eat home-cooked meals. I know, I know. How's work? Work is good. They paying you enough? Your boss... what's his name? Harvey? No, not him. Uh, somebody else. Harvey Cameron. Cameron? Is that... That's right, Cameron. Yeah. I don't work for him anymore. What happened? Did... did you get fired? No. I- I started my own company. You did? When? A few years ago. Oh. Mom, do you like it here or would you rather live at home? Where's Tracy? I wanna see my granddaughter. Is she here? No. It's just me. Oh, right. I forgot. It's a school day. What grade is she in now? Eleven. Oh. Lord. Before you know it she's gonna be married and having babies of her own. You and Anna should have had more kids. It's always been my one regret for you two. You should have had three or four. How nice would that have been? If your father had been around for longer I would have had a whole slew of kids running around. Excuse me. Here you go. Don't treat me like a baby. I can do it myself. Let me. What do you say we go for a walk? Yeah. Oh, this thing. You're choking me. Oh, I'm not. Should I get the wheelchair? No. I'd like to walk. Good. I'll call you when it's ready. Thank you. Next. Oh, you just wait. Hey, how's it going? Good. What can I get ya? I will have the classic. I'll have the same. Two classics, please. With pickles? Hell yeah. You? Yes, please. Anything to drink? Nope. Name? Tracy. Two classics with pickles. Two classics, two pickles. That'll be $16.00. Your treat, right? Oh, of course it is. So? What do you think? Do you like it? Fuck, you hate it. Oh man, I hyped it up too much. This is so good. Really? Mmmhmm. This is gonna be a problem now. Right? What'd I tell you? Oh, it's the best thing ever and at the end of the day it's just some crappy white bread and cheese but it's the best thing. Try it with that. Hmm... ketchup. Yes, of course. Perfection. I brought you a present. Mmm. Da-da-da-da! That's a good idea. Uh-huh. Cheers. Cheers. You know, I haven't hung around this neighbourhood in a really long time. Everything's different now. Oh yeah? Yeah, you know, I used to live around here. You did? Yeah. A couple of blocks up that way. A building on the corner. The one with the red brick? Yeah. Why, you know it? When did you live there? Oh, a long time ago. Right after I got married. My daughter was born in that apartment. Why'd you leave? It was a dump. I mean, this whole neighbourhood was a dump, really. We only moved there because the rent was so cheap. Really? Yeah. It wasn't like it is now. There wasn't any fancy restaurants or pop-up sandwich shops. It was rough. Our bedroom window looked directly over an alleyway and the things that we saw and heard coming outta there? You can imagine. And in the summertime? The summertime was the worst. Jesus, the smell alone. It was like a... a urinal for the homeless. Gross. Yeah. It was no place to raise a child. How old's your daughter now? She's 17. Does she live with her mom? Do you see her often? Not so much. How come? You know. Things. Yeah. I get it. Should we take these to go? Um... do you mind if we just sit here for a while? Yeah, sure. If you're chilly we can go. No, I'm ok. I just um... I have to pee. Not right now, but soon. I'm just letting you know. Ok, well if you have to pee let me know because I think there's a Starbucks up the street. I wonder if it's still open. Well, if it's not, you can pee in the alley by my old building. Yeah, good idea. ♪ ♪ It's all I've known ♪ It's all I show, ♪ And oh... ♪ Oh... ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh... ♪ ♪ ♪ Thank you. My last song this evening... What'd you think? Isn't he just...

I should send him flowers or a card or something. I already sent a card on your behalf. Thank you. You moved the table. Yeah. I needed a change. I like it. It's more spacious. I don't know how I feel about it. I liked it at first, but... I don't know. I might move it back. No, you should leave it. I was never crazy about the old layout. Really? You never mentioned that before. No. This is new. What, the painting? Yes. What're you talking about? That's been there for ages. Has it? Yeah, it has. We bought it at that little fundraiser that Helen threw at that gallery in Chinatown. You don't remember? No. The car got towed and we couldn't find a cab so we walked all the way to the tow lot. It was pouring rain. Why don't I remember this? It doesn't matter. Have a seat. No, it's ok. It's not that bad. You look like you ran face first into a brick wall.

Would you like me to take a look at it? No, it's fine. I've got the plumber coming in a few days. Ok. I don't know what to do, Anna. What am I supposed to do? I don't know. I just feel so broken. I blamed you. I wanted to hurt you. Where did that get me? Or you? We could spend the rest of our lives hating ourselves and resenting each other for what happened, but I don't want to. I'm too tired. So I think... the only thing we can do... the best thing we can do is just keep on living. We have to survive somehow. I'll always love her.
