The people of Aquafa yielded to the Zolian Empire ten years ago. I can assure you that our loyalty remains steadfast. I know it does. OFFICER: He has arrived, my lord. This salt mine... I was told you were once the supervisor. - Is that correct, Tohlim? - Correct. YOTALU: I'd like you to guide someone through it. Halt! Halt! All entry is forbidden. (horse neighs) Foolish lout!

YOTALU: Stand down. GUARD: Lord Yotalu. Thank you for coming on such short notice. Please, there's no need for that. Let me introduce Tohlim. He is the right-hand man to the king of Aquafa. I am Hohsalle Yuguraul. It's a pleasure to meet you. Sir Hohsalle, you are one of the sacred doctors. I consider making your acquaintance a great honor. The pleasure is all mine. You do yourself a disservice, sir. Your political acumen is as impressive as it is reliable. But I truly thank you for the kind words. Do I detect sarcasm? (chuckles) Not at all. I beg your pardon if this seems cold, but could you delay the cremation, Lord Yotalu? What for? HOHSALLE: I'd like to inspect the bodies first. After all, that is the reason I came all this way. (stammering, gasping) Wh-What are you doing? That boundary is sacred. (groaning) HOHSALLE: Mikimu, please. SOLDIER: That's Sir Hohsalle, huh? SOLDIER 2: Priest-doctors can't compete with Zol's physician. Especially since he apparently saved Lord Yotalu's mother. I guess keeping the second-empress alive would win trust. (gasping) - Sir Hohsalle. - Yes. Bring them, please. Right. (grunts) (gasping, exhales) - HOHSALLE: Take a look at this. - YOTALU: Just as I suspected. The falconry party was attacked by the same dogs? HOHSALLE: Yes. They bear the same bite marks. However, these aren't the only patients I've seen with these lesions. My brother, are you saying he has the same disease? What is it? I wasn't sure until now, but... It's black wolf fever, also known as mittsual. (priests gasp, whimper) The mittsual? HOHSALLE: All of them are Zolians? Condemned criminals, but yes. The people of Aquafa consider this a sacred place. It would be wrong to make them work here. HOHSALLE: Hardly any stench. The bodies down here are in better condition. Could we take some of them back to the capital with us? YOTALU: I'm sure the priest-doctors won't be happy about it. But very well. - It shall be done. - Huh? (grunts) There's nothing to fear. She's one of ours. I asked her to come down here to inspect things. What have you found? Somehow, one of the workers managed to make it out of here alive. HOHSALLE: Hmm. It's been smashed. Could that have been done by a human? SAE: He was bitten by one of the dogs, though. That caused him to collapse for a moment. Then he got back onto his feet, broke out and went that way. Hey! I asked you if this could've been done by... Makokan, let her work. A chain was dragged across the floor here. And there are bloodstains. But the footprints leading away suggest that he wasn't carried out of this mine by a dog. He walked to the exit by his own two feet. You said he was bitten. Are you sure that's where the blood came from? This pool of blood was fairly sizable. And the shape certainly suggests a bite. Should that concern us? If this man did indeed survive after being bitten by one of those dogs, then there's a strong possibility he's immune to the mittsual. Are you saying if we could track them down, that might be enough to figure out a cure? If we had the blood of a survivor and luck, yes, it's possible. YOTALU: Check the names of all the slaves that were here. OFFICER: M'lord. (yelling in pain) (grunts, whimpers) YOTALU: The Zolian army was once thought invincible. Until they were wiped out by the mittsual in a matter of days. And here it is again. OFFICER: We've discovered the name of the man who escaped. Van. He came from the Gansa clan. Wait, Van? Where was he when we took him prisoner? Records say we got him at the battle of Kashuna River. (gasps) The Lone Antlers. Broken Antler Van. SOLDIER: Lord Yotalu! Where is he? Lord Yotalu! ♪ ♪ Then he still lives. To think, there was an Aquafaese down there after all. She will find him for us. That woman is the greatest tracker this land has ever known. Can you find him? She will. Be sure she knows to bring him back to us alive. Yes, of course, sir. You heard Sir Hohsalle. We need you to bring him back alive. That will not be an easy task, sir. This Van is a surviving member of the elusive Lone Antlers. (horse whinnies) Huh? Wait! Come back! (groans) Hey, you. How are you riding my pyuika? (grunts) Wow. You're the only person I've ever seen mounted on one of those. Didn't think it was possible. There was a pack of ossam dogs that came flooding out of the forest all of a sudden. They spooked the pyuika. It slipped free of its reins and took off. Flipped my cart over on top of me in the process. Well... (grunts) At least those dogs didn't eat the poor beast. A healthy pyuika will fetch you a king's ransom if you're willing to sell it to the Zolian army. That's why I became a breeder. Of course, that's easier said than done. All of mine are wild. They won't obey my commands. I don't understand what the Zolians want - with such stubborn creatures. - Tasty. (chuckles) That's fahmu. It's a Zolian specialty. My wife baked them herself. - They're delicious, aren't they? - (grunting) You know, if I were to make a guess, I'd say it's because the Zolians didn't know how to deal with the Aquafaese pyuika riders during the last war. (sighs) MAN: You really are something special, mister. I thought the one I already had would calm down a little if I bought another female, so I decided to spend what coin I had on me. But she's already with child. - Is she really? - Mm. (sighs) These pyuika are a complete mystery to me. I guess I should be thankful for my injury. Or perhaps I should be thankful for this little goddess, huh? - Yunacha! - Huh? Yunacha? - VAN: Yuna. - (Yuna chuckles) That's her name. Yuna. Ah. Gotcha. I'm To hm a. I'm Van. TOHMA: Yuna and Van. Well, I'm much obliged. Say, have you heard the latest about the ossam dogs? Apparently, they attacked the lord's falconry party. Whatever's happening with them, it sure doesn't bode well. UTALU: Is it true? Every one of them is dead? Yes. Slaves and soldiers, for a total of 600. UTALU: Killed by lowly dogs? Actually, Sir Hohsalle says... they contracted the mittsual. (gasps, sighs) The curse of Aquafa. In our grandfathers' era, the Zolian troops who stormed this land fell prey to the disease. It was said to be the retribution of dead Aquafaese. I wonder if it's a coincidence that it's returned now, just in time for the Emperor's Eyes visit. Forgive me, my lord, but this curse is nothing more than a superstition. The people of Aquafa pledged our loyalty to you nearly ten years ago, and we would never turn our backs on you. - UTALU: What of the Aquafaese? - Uh... 600 casualties. - Were any of them from Aquafa? - AQUAFA KING: Well, I... No, none. But, brother, that doesn't... (Utalu grumbling) - (gasps) - (Utalu grunting) (gasps) UTALU: Tohlim. (grunts, chuckles) Loyal servant of Aquafa's king. (grunting) Lick it. Come over here and prove the mittsual is no curse by contracting it yourself. As you wish, my lord. (gasps) (retches) Brother. Sir Hohsalle! (grunting) At this stage, herbs won't be of any use. What can help him, then? I'll need to make an anti-poison by diluting the blood of someone who was infected. Out of the question! Lord Utalu's pure imperial blood must not be sullied by that of a mere commoner. His survival is better left for fate to decide. Bodies are not but vessels. Tainting Lord Utalu's soul would be deplorable. - PRIESTS: Deplorable! - UTALU: I need nothing. I shall heal this affliction myself, without such medicine. Well spoken, Lord Utalu. There is nothing more imperative than maintaining the purity of your soul. (Utalu groaning, wheezing) UTALU: I shall not die. I shall not die. (straining) MAKOKAN: Is it true that Aquafaese are immune to the mittsual? That Zolians are the only ones who can catch it? Some books say so, yes. Is something wrong, sir? I found Tohlim's calm demeanor a bit peculiar. - Hmm. - (chuckles) Well, a disease certainly doesn't care what country you're from. Hmm. This Emperor's Eyes visit is such nonsense. I know Fire Horse Village is sacred, but why must they go to the trouble of traveling such a great distance? I think it's because of the mittsual. It once forced the Zolian army to retreat from there. They wish to reshape history, I suppose, and to dispel fear. MAKOKAN: In that case, it's a bit ironic that the mittsual would return now, don't you think? HOHSALLE: No. I suspect that's more than coincidence. MAKOKAN: Really? How so? HOHSALLE: You're not just a swordsman anymore. Use your head. AQUAFA KING: The falconry and the salt mine. So far, it's all going according to plan. Once Yotalu succeeds his brother, Zol will be much easier to control. We're making good progress. And yet, we must be careful not to move forward too hastily. OHFAN: Are you afraid? Because at this rate, the Emperor's Eyes are going to be at the doorstep of my village as soon as spring. Have patience. One of the slaves in the mine was Aquafaese. We must maintain secrecy, so proceed with the utmost caution. OHFAN: I take no orders from the spineless minions of Zol. Oh fan, wait. Is there a reason for you to be so impatient? That's concerning. Are you certain we can trust him and Fire Horse Village to adhere to the plan? TOHLIM: At the end of the day, they are nothing more than our pawns. The mittsual is their last lifeline. They know they cannot act rashly. AQUAFA KING: And what about this Aquafaese survivor - from the salt mine? - (horse neighs) TOHLIM: We have a tracker working on finding him. AQUAFA KING: Yes, but to what end? TOHLIM: Leave that to me. The life of one Aquafaese, or the future of this entire land... Which would you choose? Hmm. That's checkmate. Obviously, you know what my choice would be. TOHLIM: As you wish. SAE: It's possible this man was traveling with a small child. Ah. Yes, there was a young man with an accent with them. Oh, the guy with the pyuika. - (birds chirping) - (sheep bleating) - (grunting) - TOHMA: Hey! Hey, I'm back! To hm a! Huh? TOHMA: Kiya! (quiet chatter) Huh? TOHMA: Hmm? Ah.

They can't speak to you directly until they've shared a drink with you. (groans) - (chuckling) - TOHMA: That's a great idea. Hey, if you'll let us put you to work here, we can give you a place to stay and all the food you can eat. Great.

For generations, we Yugurauls have served the leaders of the time with our medical expertise, to learn about countries, diseases and ourselves.

Many years ago, the Zolian army came through here and laid waste to everything, scaring all the pyuika away. Just the mention of Zol would send us trembling and running for cover. Hey! Don't drink all of it! But that all changed about ten years ago. A group of pyuika riders called the Lone Antlers took up arms against the Zolians and became Aquafa's guardians. It was because of them that Zol was willing to enter into a treaty with us. And now we have wonderful Zolian wives - to bake us delicious fahmu. - Here, have some. None for me, dear, thank you. Zolians believe that drinking the milk of a beast will turn you into a beast yourself. Huh? VAN: I was hunting a long time ago, and I saw a herd of pyuika get attacked by a pack of wolves.

To treat those, we dilute the blood of someone who was poisoned and transfuse it into the patient. Because that infected blood remembers how to fight against the poison, it weakens the effects of the snakebite. It's the same here. Your blood was able to defeat the mittsual.

But if we have patience, we can afford to lose Fire Horse Village. As long as the ossam are still alive, we will succeed one day. You dare speak to me of patience? For our country, in the interest of its future. What about Hohsalle? If he manages to find a cure, that future we dream of shall never come. The key to all of that is the man who escaped from the salt mine. All we have to do is remove him from the equation. ELDER: The anger of some has been reignited by the return of the Emperor's Eyes. And all the rumors about the mittsual coming back again are only fanning the flames. This land used to belong to Aquafa. This is Zol's punishment. ELDER: The lord and his wife cared for the people of our village a great deal, and they were good and kind. They were the reason our village was able to prosper as much as it did. Foolishness. Sir, do you know where my mother went? (gasps) (fire rumbling) ELDER: An Aquafaese curse. There are many who call the mittsual Zol's divine punishment. Let's go. I only pray that this doesn't lead to another war breaking out. Why was I the one to survive this disease? ♪ ♪ HOHSALLE: The mittsual. It kills Zolians but not Aquafaese. There has to be a reason. It is not mere chance. If we look closely, we will find the hidden threads of the true cause. And by following those threads, we will save many lives. Trusting that is the basis of the medical arts. ♪ ♪ HOHSALLE: Van. There must be a reason why you survived. We just haven't found it yet. VAN: These medical arts of yours, do they just save the body? Or the soul, too? As long as the body is saved, the soul will be saved, as well. Yuna saved my soul. Without her, I'd be lost. HOHSALLE: His soul. The way he speaks of it, it sounds different somehow, compared to the soul the priest-doctors believe in. (horse whinnies) (rumbling) - (horse neighing) - Whoa. It's a guide for the emperor's balloon. He's getting closer. HOHSALLE: The Emperor's Eyes visit. Then we must be close. Yes. Fire Horse Village isn't much farther from here. HOHSALLE: This place was once protected by the mittsual. Yet another hidden thread. (distant rumbling) (snarling) I can no longer hear the sound of any voices. Huh. (child crying) The young ones let themselves get bitten again? Yes, sir. They seem to have snuck into the sanctuary at night. OHFAN: They should have known better. They're incapable of receiving the power. Chief Oh fan, they only wished to repay you. The fools. They wished to succeed their king. ♪ ♪ - SAE: Dismount your horses. - HOHSALLE: Hmm? - (Hohsalle grunts) - (horse neighing) Stilt-walker. High on your left. (grunts) (gasps) (stilt-walker grunts) What are you doing? We are Aquafaese, too. Why attack us? We can all be blinded by our fear and hatred. I was once just like them. YOTALU: A few years ago, I actually had an encounter with Broken Antler Van. Six Lone Antlers decimated us. My squadron was almost wiped out. Lucky you survived. No, I was only a boy, so Van refused to kill me. - (rumbling) - (all gasp) (soldiers gasping, murmuring) (sighs) Sorry to make us rest here. Not befitting of a doctor. Van, may I ask a question? What is she like, this Yuna of yours? Where do I start? Yuna is... She has small hands. They're soft and also a bit clingy. ♪ ♪ Her cheeks are rosy, round and warm. Her hair is a little unruly, but... tying it into pigtails makes her smile with delight. She loves to smile. She likes animals. But insects, not so much. She loves to drink pyuika milk. And she knows how to milk them herself, too. Meat tastes better when I'm around her. She can't chew her food very well, but she smiles when she's got a mouthful. Sometimes when she's sleeping, she'll latch onto my back. (chuckles softly) Holds on so tight it hurts a little bit. I can't say I ever dreamed of being a father again, but all I want to do is show her everything. I want to see her grow, to fall in love with someone, get married, and... I want to keep watching over her all the while. SAE: A deer whistle? VAN: Yes. The child you made it for isn't really yours, though. Thanks for this. The child, she's an orphan from a nearby village, given to an unstable salt miner to calm her down. Yes. But there are things more important than blood. Yuna is my daughter. - That's all that matters. - (chuckles softly) The way you talk reminds me that some things are invisible to a tracker. You'll want to travel northwest from these hot springs. Follow the valley when you reach it. That will lead you to Fire Horse Village. The ossam will be waiting for you. Your daughter will be there. Why did you go to the trouble of bringing us out this far? SAE: She's a survivor of the mittsual, too. I was planning on killing the both of you. Are you leaving? You found yourself a good village. Take her back when you find her. My name's Sae, by the way. Next time we meet, you can call me that. (grunts softly) ♪ ♪ (gasps softly) (gasps) HOHSALLE: When I awoke, the woman had left us.

(whistle screeching) (whistle echoes) (Hohsalle chuckles) Not really a pleasant sound, is it? (both laugh) Yuna's just beyond this tunnel. Yes. The land of the mittsual. Wha... Hey. Wait for me! KENOI: At last, you have come, Van. I've been waiting. (muffled grunting) KENOI: With your power, you will become one with the village's remaining ossam. They are the key to our future. Come, Van.

We forgot all about them. Don't even know how to breed them. And yet still they gather here. This land is sacred for the pyuika, too. So, then, what do you say you and I reclaim this realm together? Van? Van! YUNA: Pretty, right? Right? (chuckles) Who are you? It's so pretty. (chuckles) Pretty? YUNA: Because they glow. HOHSALLE: The asshimi? Are you... (gasps) Yuna. - Ossam. - MAN: I'm sorry, but that area is off-limits to you. It's good to see you again, Sir Hohsalle. We studied together in Otawalle. My name is Shikan. Please, sir, I need your help. OHFAN: Last autumn, the so-called right-hand man to the king of Aquafa paid a visit to this village. He said Zolian Emperor Natalu was going to resume the visit of the Emperor's Eyes. He said they'd long forgotten their fear of the mittsual. They didn't remember just how well it protected this village. That is why Kenoi chose to lead the ossam once again. It was necessary, to remind the Zolians why they should be afraid. However, the Dog King is growing old, and his power is unfortunately waning. A successor needs to take his place as the leader of the pack. And it cannot be me, for the mittsual has chosen you, Van. (shallow breathing) What happened? Was this the mittsual's doing? SHIKAN: Yes. HOHSALLE: But these children... - Aren't they Aquafaese? - They are. They should have been immune to it, but they're not. They've been infected as if they were Zolians. But why? I do not know. All of them are liberated captives from Zol. Perhaps it's because they were raised in Zolian villages. I can't think of any other reason, unless... maybe the disease has mutated. HOHSALLE: They were bitten by the ossam? SHIKAN: Yes. After Oh fan freed them, they wanted to repay him for it, so they let the dogs bite them. Let them? Why volunteer to be bitten? They wanted the power to become the next Dog King. I don't understand. SHIKAN: The ossam can only be led by a human who's survived one of their bites. Someone the mittsual chooses to bestow with a special power. VAN: Why was I the one to survive this disease? (gasps) Are you talking about Van? Yes. BOY: Does that mean a successor has been found? We tried. We weren't worthy. But it's okay. He found one. Congratulations. You did it, Chief Oh fan. - (boy coughing) - (Shikan gasping) - Boil some water. - Huh? - Do you have any ikimi? - A little, yes. I'll teach you a combination to mix it with. - Bring your herbs. - Right. HOHSALLE: Damn it. Where are you, Van? Hey, newcomer, get a move on! (grunting) Huh? Wait, that woman. Hey, the food! Come back! TOHLIM: You disobeyed my order. SAE: Yes. His life nullifies everything. Letting him go means the mittsual will no longer pose a threat. And I don't have to explain to you what that means for us. You disappoint me. Take her away. SOLDIERS: Yes, sir. Get up. That's the tracker woman, is it not? Yes. It appears she lost the survivor from the salt mine. - She what? - (sighs) TOHLIM: Now all we can do is watch as the visit of the Emperor's Eyes proceeds. I'll ensure Ohfan's silence. - And abandon Fire Horse Village? - Yes. And grit our teeth as we gaze upon the emperor's smiling face. We sacrifice far too much. (Makokan panting) You! Tracker woman! Where is he? - SOLDIER: What are you... - Where is Sir Hohsalle? Where did you leave him? - SOLDIER: Stop it! - Move! I must ask that woman a question! (whimpering) Help! Hel... (groans) By now, Sir Hohsalle and Van should have reached Fire Horse Village. Follow the cliffs three leagues to the north. You'll find a secret path to the village hidden in the mountainside. (shallow breathing) It is morning now. Drink this pyuika milk. It will nourish you. All the villagers here drink it. And there was a time when all the people of Aquafa did. These boys grew up as captives of Zol, so they refuse it because they don't like the smell. I wish I could convince them they need it. (gasps) Chief Oh fan is coming. There you are. You're the sacred doctor, aren't you? You should know, Van is here for a reason. The mittsual brought the former leader of the Lone Antlers to this land to become its new king. That is the will of the gods. Only the chosen ones can survive the disease. HOHSALLE: No! A disease is all it is, not the will of the gods. With the help of Van's blood, I can save those children. Interesting. Then you're here because you seek Van. Very well. I suppose all will be decided once he has become the next Dog King. Go, Van. Kenoi's waiting for you. - And your daughter is with him. - HOHSALLE: No. Don't do it, Van! (grunts) It's true. The mittsual does appear to be godly. We can't guess when or why it'll happen. And we don't yet know why it will spare some but kill others. As it stands, it is far beyond our grasp. And yet, that does not justify giving up. Perhaps it seems to be destiny, but isn't fighting against destiny how we've managed to survive this long? Hmm. Actually, I'm quite satisfied with my destiny. (chuckles) Zolian Emperor Natalu. I'll gladly give my life to end his. ♪ ♪ (growling) KENOI: Are you willing? Answer me, Van. Amidst the sea of darkness, the mittsual found you. Use it to remake our world as the Dog King. Do that which your soul surely desires. I lost my family, which left me groveling in the darkness for a long time. Until Yuna saved me. She brought me back from the abyss. That little girl was what saved my soul. (rumbling) Yuna! KENOI: She is favored by the ossam, as well. Like you, she has been given the power to become their ruler. This is the answer you seek. Give in to it, Van. - VAN: No. - Hmm? VAN: This is no place for her to live. And I want to live on with her, so I must continue to resist. I cannot be the Dog King.
