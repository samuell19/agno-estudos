Oh, my god! Murali is drowning. Help! Somebody help! Please come over! Hey, call the police. Please move away. The one standing to the side. Give way to the Fire Force. Move away, please. Murali, please open your eyes. Somebody press his stomach, and drain the water inside. Water, the essential drink. ♫ The eyes are as blue as the deep blue sea. ♫ ♫ The lips are adorned with mesmerizing beauty. ♫ ♫ It's jubilation, music, and fun, all over the night. ♪ ♫ The clouds over the skies dance to the tune of the music. ♫ ♫ It's merriment all around. ♫ Honey, Kaimal Sir has come. He is a staunch Gandhian. He has participated in Dandi March. Sir, please... May you remain a sumangali forever. You can't leave without having food. I'm sorry, I can't put up with the rush. That's fine. I'll manage a seat for you, please come. ♫ Now the dreams get wings like butterflies. ♫ ♫ You sail in the breezy wind together. ♫ ♫ With soothing music all around. ♫ ♫ It's merriment all around. ♫ Just hold on. Move it aside. Pour it into this. Enough! Enough! Sambar. [Curry] Sheenu, do you want Sambar? -Water. - Sambar. - Do you want Sambar? - Water. - Sambar. - Water. Murali, you stop serving, and start eating. - Go. - I'll eat later. I know, you have not eaten anything since yesterday. No worries. You may eat now. If at all we want to conduct another marriage in our family, she must give birth to a kid. - You start eating. - You have a seat, sit. - I'm saying it. - I'll eat later. You come on. Mohan, hold this. Come on, sit. No, eh.. He is our family member. Very smart. He is a hard worker. Do you know who he is? Kaimal sir! He's an ardent follower of Gandhiji. He's participated in Dandi March and all. Ha! Ha! You know what, The children of today have no discipline. Yes, that's true. - They aren't polite either. - Very true. That's why Gandhi insists on learning Yoga. From where did you learn Yoga? I was with Gandhiji at Sabarmati Ashram for long. To be frank, it is delighting to see your face. And it is giving us an immense peace. That's God's blessing! What happened? What's wrong? It's Brandy. Just add water to it. Why making a big scene for such a silly thing? Who the hell served alcohol in the feast? Who the fuck had a Gandhian drink alcohol? Be cool, please. - I'll cool down later. - We will find a way out. Listen Browski, we needn’t have any relationship with these rascals who do not respect a patriot. What do you mean by 'no relationship'? How is that possible? What happened? What's the problem? Have you no shame for humiliating an idealistic person like him who hasn't even chewed water in his entire life? He's just a Gandhian, and not Gandhi. It's enough to make him drink some curd milk. Give it your fucking dad. Sister, please sit. Let's talk and resolve things. Das, let's talk it out. What wrong has he done to insult him in a marriage function? We don't need any relationship with such uncultured fellows. Do you remember what teacher taught you in class? No? Then, what were you up to in the class? You write! I'll read out the question. Just write the answer. 'What is pollution?' What on earth is this? Is she preparing for IAS exam to teach her over night? Meenu, Meenu... Look at your book, and write. Hey. Go and sleep, honey. Meenu. What's the use of studying like this? Just to spoil the kid. What is it? A frog? Hasn't anyone slept yet? Did I get home early? [A rooster crowing.] Why is the rooster crowing? [The clock ticking.] Is it 5.30 am? Second question. 'Name the different types of pollution'? Sonny, Bhava, where's the phone? Here it is. One sec please, don't sing songs. Let me try calling Murali. Thank god, if he picks up the call. Tell him that we are almost there. Just 5 minutes. 5 minutes! It's right down the slope. Hi Murali, Sonny, we will reach you in 5 minutes. Aren't you ready? Yes, yes, in 5 minutes... We will be there in 5 minutes, OK? Be ready, OK? Sister, Is Murali at home? It's been one week since he'd borrowed Rs.500 from me. Now then, he doesn't come in front of me. The money was kept aside for paying my son's fees. Murali, just give me my money and go. I'll give it for Onam, sis. I'm coming. Murali, just tell me, and go. Murali, move your body and come. It's already late. I'll give it for Onam. I'm going for a marriage thing... She's come asking for money. Murali, have you boozed right in the morning? You stink of booze. Yuck! Me? No, I didn't drink today. This smell is from yesterday's... Where is the thing? The house is right down the slope. That's not what I asked. Where's the booze? What the crap is he saying? Murali, what are you worrying about? Abhi is treating all of us after seeing the bride. He's gonna spoil everything, OK? That's not the thing. I feel peppy if I booze and go. Yes, yes, he's too much of pep. What's her sun sign? We can ask her after reaching there. Don't be in a hurry. Hey, You shouldn't linger on there for a long time. Or else, you will lose your value. What the heck are you doing? Don't ruin my shirt. Murali, couldn't you wear proper clothes today? Shucks! Nobody cares to look at me. That's true. Even you! We are reaching. Be decent. How do I open the door? Get out, quick. We are late, I think. - It's an old mansion, I guess. - Come on, fast. The house and surroundings don't look neat. Come on, anyways. It's late. Did you lose your way? We are dot on time. It's late for me. That's what I meant. I've an urgent meeting. Hey, get them tea. Come on, sit. Welcome them in. Don't utter a word about booze, OK? Half a cup is enough. Or else, they will take more time to drink it all up. Luckily, it isn't hot. Or else, he'd sit and blow over it for an hour. No need of procession. Take only the mixture. Enough! Enough! Serve it to them. Hey, put the buttons on. Comb your hairs if you want. Come! Come! Give it to them, honey. Make it fast, dear. Give it fast, honey. They would be in a hurry. I don't want it. Is everyone like him? No, no, I drink tea. Give the mixture to me. It's good. If she has anything to talk to me... - Don't take a chance. - That's better. See, I want to think about this. I need a day's time. - I'll inform the decision to the broker. - Alright. You sit there. Drink it peacefully and then go. I'm in a hurry. Come on, Vinod. It's regarding my job. See ya. What a hurry-burry is this? What a dad he is? Come, let's go. We are leaving. Let me finish the tea. Hey. [A folk song.] - I want some gravy. - There's no gravy. Bro, can you give me some gravy? There's no gravy. [Would she have liked me?] Why not? I've told them that you neither drink nor smoke. Why aren't you giving me gravy? If so, why do you keep the shop open? - Are you going to make it an issue? - No, I just want some gravy. Hey. Get me some gravy. A little will do. A little. Didn't I tell you that there's no gravy? This shop is not what I asked for. But only some gravy... Hey, Ain't I saying it to you that there's no gravy? Why is it so? Buy a full plate of curry, if you want. How bad you open the shop and give me no curry? I can't give you any gravy. Buy a full plate of curry, if you want. - Don't make a mess out of here. - Who's messing up things? Don't get yourself beaten up. We can go to the other shop. Murali, c'mon, let's go. We can booze from a shop where there's no fight. You paid the money, right? What a food! It tasted yuck. OK, take care. Give me change. [Money] I don't have change. Where can I get it? Ask somewhere over there. His smile says that he doesn't drink. Bro, do you have change? Uncle! See, who's sitting here? Is this what you told, he doesn't drink or smoke? We didn't know that you are here. Or else, we would've gone to any other shop. Isn't it so? OK then, we will call you tomorrow. No need. You needn't call. So, that girl's also gone. Come on. Come on. What's it? - He's in trouble. - This marriage also got stalled. What? What's wrong? - No change, sorry. - What's the matter? Hey! Is your urgent meeting taking place here? I understood it right from the beginning... that you are our type. You too. Hey, get us two glasses of toddy. 2 glasses of toddy. Do you know why I like you? Do you smoke? It's harmful to your health, you know? - Bro, give me 2 bottles of toddy. - What? - Bro, Toddy! - Toddy? Why? Isn't it a toddy shop? Yes, it is. But there's no toddy for girls. Why is it so? Do you have guys with you? No, but we are 5 in numbers. No matter you are 5 or 10, We don't sell booze to girls. But you have not kept any board saying, 'no booze to girls'. No matter what, we don't sell booze to girls. We have seen shops like this even before. I agree! But, this place is notorious. - You go home. - Fucking get out of here! You don't have to scare us with your gigantic body. Just like a rhinoceros. Why is he being so rude at us? Hey. Why do you get scared when he tries to scare you off? Bro, what shall we do if they don't give us toddy? - Do you have money with you? - Yes. So, you have money... but no man. OK, come with me. - I'll buy it for you. - Awesome! What's your name, bro? I'm Murali. They are my folks. Why do you want to know my name for boozing? It seems like you want to drink in my name. Sit. Toddy is not the only thing you get here... but yummy tapioca, sardine curry songs... Then... Mashe, they are our folks. He's our Yesudas [Singer] with no beard. He sings really well. Mashe, please sing our song. ♫ When we were to part, after meeting for the first time, ♫ ♫ I realised that I lost my heart in your eyes. ♫ ♫ When I came back to you, looking for it ♫ ♫ I found your eyes shut, as if you didn't want to give it away. ♫ ♫ And I eagerly waited for long beside your door steps. ♫ ♫ The night is over, and the sun has risen. ♫ ♫ Have you still not opened your eyes? ♫ ♫ What's taking you so long, my lovely girl? ♫ ♫ If you don't give back my brimming heart, ♫ ♫ I will recall all those things that I had forgotten. ♫ ♫ But I realize that I can recall only your charming face, ♫ ♫ All other memories just faded away, like lines drawn in the water. ♫ ♫ I searched for it again and again. ♫ ♫ I twitched my eyelids over and over, ♫ ♫ Where's my thumping heart, my lovely girl? ♫ ♫ Like the kohl blent into the waves inside your eyes, ♫ ♫ My heart coalesced into yours, with no coming back to me. ♫ ♫ I spend the rest of my life, pondering over what to do next. ♫ Bro, just put your foot down. Go faster. What are you saying, my dear? It starts early in the morning. Why so early? Every time I see, he'll be riding on the pillion. Hey, It's Nisha. Pull over. Hi. Where are you heading this way? I'm going to Haseena's house. Oh, is it this way? Yes, this way is straight to her house. - OK, then. - Where are you guys going? [Actor] Laletan's new movie is releasing today. "Sagar Alias Jacky." Are you drunk right in the morning? I'm asking if you are drunk right in the morning? Nah! What are you saying? Don't you know that I don't drink in the morning on those days, Laletan's movie is releasing? I know, let me check. What are you upto? I just had a little. Just one peg. I will not drink again. I swear, I won't drink. Then, promise me. What is she asking for? Promise me, Murali. Promise me, I say. I won't drink, my dear. Nisha. Hey. Go! Go! Don't tell him that it's me. Haven't I told you many times not to hang around with this drunkard? Get on to the bike. Simply to make people gossip about you. What's your problem? Why are you always sweet talking to him? I like Murali a lot. I'll go away with him. What can be done, if boozers also start romancing girls? What's the use of someone here being a nondrinker? Where were you? The film began. Get in fast. - The film began? - Yes. Stop lagging behind, and get in fast. My dear Lalettan, muah! Muah! muah! I want to call Laletan after watching the movie. Do you have his new number? He changed his old number as you constantly pestered him with calls. I rang up Mathrubhumi office, Mattannoor branch, saying I am Mattannoor.... Who is the guy who plays Chenda? - Sankarankutty Nair! - Yes, Sankarankutty Nair. And asked for Laletan's number. Has the movie begun? No, right? Lalettaa!!! It began. "Peace be upon you." No worries. Look at her. This girl. She's a bit problematic. - Is she your relative? - Get lost, relative it seems! I saw her hanging around with another set of guys last week. That is when the accident took place... I couldn't even say 'thank you' to you. You may say it now. - Thank you. - Welcome. By the by, what do you do, Sir? I do a small business. What business? Earlier, I sold Biscuits. Now, It's contract... Construction! Oh, Building construction. At times, I build... And at times, I pull down... OK, Good night. Good night, Sir. No matter what you say, Murali is extra decent. It's true that he drinks. Is that not enough? Though he drinks, he's a helping hand for everyone. Who was there for Kunjechi's marriage... for arranging everything...? I can't even think about it. Didn't you argue with your dad for him? That too for a drunkard? You needn't tell me about dad. He might not be drinking booze. But, Is he doing any good to anyone in this place, being a nondrinker? Can you just stop this? You talk about him everyday. There is another thing. Murali will look after me more than dad does to you. I'm sure about it. He knows how to respect women. He understood the matter. You don't You understand it, Rozario? You don't know Jacky as an enemy. Take care. Take care. Hey, Manoj K Jayan, you cheated our Lalettan, right? Come, let me go buy something to eat. Get me touchings. Ground nuts will do. I'll go and see. They won't have facilities for it. Keep quiet. We can check it out while going. Hey chap, don't you want to pee? What? What?? - What's it? - It's been sometime... What are you talking about? Why did you pull my hair? Who pulled your hair? It's been sometime you'd started it. Started what? What do you want? - What's your problem? - What the hell do you want? Will you give me what I want? Why do you want to nose into unnecessary things? How dare you touch me? I'm Umman Chandi's nephew. Umman Chandi's nephew it seems. I'm Commissioner's brother. What's with me if you are Commissioner's brother? We are family. What's your problem with it? What family are you saying? I saw you doing things together. I saw it myself. Isn't it you who grabbed my legs? - Who grabbed your legs? - Isn't it you who grabbed my legs? You don't have to act as a loyal wife. I know her. Last week... didn't I tell you? I saw her hanging around with another set of guys. Don't talk rubbish, you scumbag. What a pity! - Have you come here before? - Yeah, yes. Eh? For what? Have you seen the tiles laid over here? Yes. They were supplied by our company for free. Your company? Not mine but my Boss'. Come one by one, and sign here. - What's your name? - Vijayan! Vijayan! Write you name and signature. - Where do I sign, Sir? - Here. OK. Be careful. They are testing for alcohol. Oh, my gosh! Put down your dhoti. What's your name? Er... Murali. Why are your eyes red? I have sore eyes. Write your name, and signature. Where's it? 'Ma'. 'Mu'. 'Mura...' 'Murala'. I'm not done. 'Murila'. Let me go, Sir? Sir, the guys from Theater Case has come. Call them inside. Come on. Move to this side. Ask them to come in. Hey, come on in. Come on in. Go and stand there. Stand there! There! - What's your name? - Madhurima. - Are you the complainant? - Yes. Who are you? She's my wife's niece. He's her husband, Lijjil. He's her brother, Madhu. Drinking and eve-teasing is his hobby. He's a kind of Anti-Social. It's not him who created the problems. That's him. But he was there with him. What's your name? Were you there in the theater? You stay outside. Who among you were beaten up? - It's me. - Who beat you? That's him. Move to this side. Do I have to tell you individually to turn this side? Turn this side. - What's the matter? - I beat him because he lied. Will you beat someone for telling lies? He lied saying that he's Umman Chandi's nephew. Umman Chandi doesn't have a sister. That's a lie. Rajendran. Ask Geetha to take her testimony and let her go. Go out. Take both of them, and make them clean the toilets of Taluk hospital. - OK, Sir. - Then, let them go. Come with me. Madhurima, wife of Lijjil Prabhakaran, Mangalam house, Keezhattoor, Thaliparamba. 24 years old. Madhurima. So, 'Githa'. [Bhagvath Gita] "I shall give only the truth before the court." Sir, I don't believe in this. Then? Constitution! Who's that? He will come now... Might be a witness. Indian Constitution is what I believe. With the bad intention of abusing the woman, he publicly insulted her, grasping her thighs... Not thighs. Thighs, huh? It's my legs. Let him stay behind bars, and learn how to behave to women. For 40 days. I escaped because Madhurima beat him. The news says, the girl was pinched on her thighs. - What a wonderful guy! - Yeah, true. What all claims did she have about him? When Prakashan was in jail, it's our dying Murali, who did all the necessary help needed for him. And this ungrateful chap is living happily after marrying a girl. He shouldn't have helped him. What happened to the girl? What else? Nisha got married to another guy. And Murali got fucked up. Poor Murali, isn't he? Who's Murali's bystander? - Doctor is calling you in. - Alright. One person will do. Hey, you stay here. I'll go speak to him. You stay here. I'll go speak to him too. Who're you? - I'm Murali's teacher. - Please sit. - Do you booze? - No. Then? I just go with him for a company. He's not going to live longer for giving him a company. His liver is almost over. Oh, my gosh! So, won't he be able to booze anymore? Best teacher, best students! Almost all of his organs have expired. I'm prescribing a few medicines. But I don't think it will help. Doctor, Is there any other way out? Stop boozing. That's the only way. Dad, who's a 'Water Man'? Kiddie, they're the people who are always under the influence. Hey, is this how you talk to a kid? Honey, they are the people who carry water to places. Suni. Two of our chickens are missing. Did they get caught by any fox? Mom, just ask him when, the people who'd gone to see the bride returned the previous day. What a pity! The chickens were reared for giving eggs to our kid. Do cocks lay eggs? Will you kill me, fucking mom? You will never prosper in life. That's because I was born in this family. I should have born in any other family. BEEP. Dude, Pick out the dry sheets, OK? How do I find them? Just bite and see. If it is raw, your tooth will stick together. Oh, Really? Then, I'll eat it. Will sis come now? We are safe, if she doesn't come. Dude, 2 bottles for 10 MC sheets. That's enough for now! We will rock it today. Stop there, moron! This idiot is trading off my hard work for booze. I'll kill you, bloody! Stop there, I say. I can't run. Drop it and run? Run, or else she will kill me. - Hey, hey, hey. - Escape! - I'll break your leg. - Don't throw it, Podimol. - Wait, wait, I'll come to you. - No! No! I'll catch you, dirty pig! It has been sometime... Don't throw it at me, Podimol. Get lost, you! If you ever come to this house again, I'll fucking kill you. He's come for stealing. For making money to get sloshed. It's very cold here, isn't it? My dear Murali, Will you ever feel hot near a pond side? That's not it. The cool is because of this rock. What a discovery! Have you ever cut stones? - No, I haven't. - Yeah, that's what. I've cut a hell lot of stones. The cool is from the stones. It may be cold there. But it's very hot here. That kind of a blow is what I just got. It's the money for two Full that she threw away. Can you take it once more? Yes, of course! You can take my dead body. Let the time come. I'll take it. Given my condition, the time is up. Murali. Dude. Don't you want to ride your cousin's new Benz car? Saji has come from the Gulf. He's bought a Benz car. He's throwing a party it seems. Has he come? But he didn't call me. He might have rung you up, and failed to connect you since your phone is dead. That's true. My phone is dead. Then, how can he call me? Our deity is very powerful. I was just thinking a way out to get a drink. You know what, you are my messenger from god. - Are you coming with me? - What else shall I do? Then come on. Go to temple and pray without sitting like this. OK, disciple. Murali, what did we drink last time? - Scotch or Whiskey? - It's Scotch Whiskey. Oh! Scotch Whiskey. I think he's changed the paint of the house. It's a huge house, Murali. Close the gate and come in. Murali, don't spit there. Sonny. This is BMW. No, it's a Benz, Murali. Can't you see? You son't have to teach me. Kiddo, Do you know me? I'm your Murali uncle. You stay here. Aunty. Hey. Watch and ride. Do you have a license? Aunty. Who's come to our house? Long time no see. Where were you? I'm too busy, aunty. Yes, yes, I know what it is. What's this? Saji bought it for me. Your neck will break, ha! ha! - Where's my brother? - He's upstairs. Hi, what on earth? Murali? Hi Viji... Have you gotten slim? - No chance. - I'll serve it. No, I'll give it. - When's he coming? - Next month. Ask him to bring... "May peace be upon you." Don't say anything. Just come back immediately. You stole Arab's wig, didn't you? Your boorish wig is lying here. He said, he will burn you as well as your wig. He's cussing me out. Do you get it? Why don't you speak? Bro, please listen. There's no one else to give bath to baby, wash the car. Why are you being so irresponsible? You should come back right now. Catch the next flight, and be here. Otherwise, you are fired. Beware of it. Don't say a word more. - Thank you. - I'll fucking kill you. Thank you. - How clumsy do you look? I knew that you came. He is my cousin. He is a 'Water Man', an all time boozer. He does tiles work. Poor guy! Oh, I see. Hey. Do you have any manners? I thought it's his glass. Can't you watch the glass before taking it? Is this the way your Cousin behaves? Murali, please go. You can drink later. Please go. He's acting up. Idiot! - Is it how he must behave? - There was no need to beat him. - Then what? - Leave it. A down and out donkey! He fucking spoiled my mood. Yes! Yes! Is it for making curry? But it's not dry enough. Saji has come from Dubai. Did you know? Who cares? What? Give me 200 rupees. Get lost. He's grown out to a big bull. Still, he's begging for money. Don't you know Savithri's son? A chain worth 5 Pavan is what he gifted to his wife. You may booze and spoil your life. I hate that idiot. Don't waste it making curry. If sold, you will get a good price. Hey. Darling. Give me a 100 rupees no? Sweety. Give me 50 rupees, at least. He bought it for us. The radio, and the emegency. "I have no money with me'. [Song from radio] You be a waste like this. "I have no money with me'. "Not even a single paisa for buying poison". My son got promoted as Thahasildar. His posting is in Thalasseri. Hey! Can't these guys go home, and crash out? You may leave, Narayanan. - I want to meet someone here. - OK, then. You stay here. Vijaya. Vijaya. - Hey, Vijaya. - Hi, bro. Hey, Vijaya. Jaison is in the hospital. - Tell them to switch it off. - Switch it off, please. Idiot, just switch it off. Our Jaison is in the hospital. He's Dengue fever. - Sorry to hear that. - I need 1600 rupees. 1600 rupees? I don't have any money. I'll get money after cutting and loading these. 102 degree fever! Oh, my god! Won't he die of temperature? When... when are you going to finish this? Give the money, it's just 1600 rupees. I told you, I don't have money. He's crying over there, dude. You ask the Bengali if he has money. You shut up. He will beat me. No use of asking them. They will have money only if I give. They will not have.. - Poor Jaison! - I'm poorer than him. I don't have any money. What shall we do now? Tell me something. What shall I say? See, the manager is calling. God knows what it is. Hi Manager, don't cuss. Two loads are coming to you. Murali, If we don't pay the money, he'll be in trouble. I came with you thinking, you had the money for drinking. You invited me, and I thought you had the money. Did I ever have money with me? Didn't you people go yet? Manager... Can we sell this machine? [It will reach you soon.] Please keep quiet. We will do it after he goes. You may go and eat. Come on. He's asking us to eat and come. Come on. Come on. Where's he going to? Might be for getting money. Murali, This is going to be bad. You be here. Dear Vijayan, hurry up. I'll show you something. What are you saying, Bhava? Don't I know Murali? Is he going to cut it, and load it all alone? - Don't I know him? - You needn't trust me. See for yourself. I'm not seeing Murali for the first time. - Give him the money. - Ah! Murali! Hey chap. What a surprise! You may go. Take out the money. You did the cutting and loading all by yourself? Leave it. Give me the money. Why not? I'll give the money for sure. Take out the money. Here it is. Be patient! Don't snatch it from me. Get going to the hospital. Fast, fast, fast. He's not in the hospital. We have pawned him in the bar. In the bar? Can't you do some job, and fend for yourself? Will you get the happiness of sitting idle from working? It normally takes a week's time to finish loading these much stones altogether. Wow! Anyways, I needn't work anymore today. Boss, who's he? He's a Mallu. But, he doesn't go for a job. Hey. Stop the work, and go home. Go! Go! See, I'll tell you something. You must stop being friends with that rascal Murali from now. Do you get it? He doesn't care about anything. You hardly go for a job. Even if you go to the quarry, you will sit and booze with the quarrymen. Can't you stop boozing? Then... Look at me! I'll tell you one more thing. If you repeat this, I'll kill you for sure. I mean, both of you! Eat lavishly. Don't make any compromise on it. - Eat up everything, dumbo! - Are the Idlis over? What? - What the fuck do you want? - Nothing. I'll fucking make Dosa and give you. It's simple. Just ask for NRI Saji's brother's house. My Benz car is lying in the front yard. You can find it easily. Saji, which of these glasses is good for filling Payasam? - This one. - OK. Saji, juice for you. My dear Jijimol, please leave me alone. If she sees, that's it. She is looking for reasons to fight with me. Ha! Are you relatives turning up at this time? It's just an engagement and not marriage. - Hasn't Murali come? - Hasn't he reached yet? No, I didn't see him anywhere here. Come! Come! Sheenu, just hold on. Get me some cold water, dear. I'm not sure if it is there. Let me see. Or Pepsi will do. You are my lovely Sheenu. Thank you! God bless you. No need of saying thanks, holding girls' hands, OK? Then I'll hold your hands, oldie. He's all the time under influence. I'm not drinking with your money. As if I'm going to give my money to you. I bought it from Dubai. It's 4 Pavan of gold. So, with everyone's consent, we are moving on to the ring exchange ceremony. What are you muttering about? Saji, Sheenu's ring is missing. What? Sheenu's ring is missing. These girls are very careless. Aren't you? It will be there somewhere. Go and check. Please come. Come on. Saji, just a minute. Sis, are you sure? Yes, I saw it with my eyes. Are you sure? Yes. Are you sure, pakka? Did you actually see it? Don't give it a guess. I saw Murali holding her hands. He touched me. And shook my hands. Are you Sania Mirza to shake your hands? Come on. Where is he? Murali. Hey, Murali. Just come here for a minute. Have you taken Sheena's ring? If you have taken her ring, give it back to her. Why would I want her ring? - Saji, you move. - I didn't take it. Wait, wait, wait. What are you saying? I've not taken it. Don't misbehave after coming home. If you want money for buying booze, won't I give you? Bro, I drink enough. Then, why would I need her ring? Why would I take her ring? You come to this side. It was there on my hand. I'm sure. - Let me see. - I didn't take it, bro. Babu, get your hands off of me. Move backwards. Let us check. What are you doing? Didn't I tell you, I've not taken it? You know how terrible I can be. I've not taken it, Bro. I swear. Why should I take her ring? I've not taken it. Just ask her. Sheena, did I take your ring? Weren't I shaking hands with you? You tell me, did I take it? I just shook hands with her for a Pepsi she gave me. Don't stage a drama here. I'm not lying. I've not taken it. Just ask her. The problem is solved if you give it back. Or else, we will call Police. You should bring up your children properly. Otherwise, this is the case. Hubby! Hubby! He takes things only from home. He will not steal from others. Our son is a drunkard. But he's not a thief. I swear, I've not taken it, bro. Murali, tell us the truth. I swear, I didn't steal. We will not let you go unless you return the ring. I promise upon my mother, I've not taken it. See, my mom's there. I haven't taken it, mom. I'll never steal, mom. Mom, please tell them that I won't steal. Hi Reghu, come over. Geez! All of you have come, huh? Have you started inviting for marriage? Yes, we are inviting one by one. Renu, come out. Reghu and Vimala have come. I'm sorry about that day. Anybody would react in such a situation. Saji's friends are the ones who blew it way out of proportion. You yourself used to tell me, right? About Murali's character... Saji is too good. He bought us 5 Pavan of gold for the marriage. He cherishes his family. You know, the marriage falls on 26th of next month. Please mark 25th and 26th on your calendar. What's the need of noting it down? To accuse me of stealing? Goes without saying. That's not the thing. Please lock Undappan (Murali) inside the house for those two days. This is the first marriage in our family, right? Am I mad to lock me inside? Kitty... There's no point in wearing bindi like this. You must learn to understand people. Unfortunately, I happen to be his mother. Or else I could kill him, adding poison in his food. What can I do? I'm not able to stop it. Do people deliberately get drunk? It's easy to advise others. First you start drinking. Then, you will understand how difficult it is to stop it. This time, I want dad to come with me. You're the one who come with me every time. Riya's father comes. Siya's Pappa also comes. Stand still. What are you guys fighting for? It's PTA meeting in my school today. Didn't I tell you yesterday? Sorry, I forgot. Let's go? I'll go with her. Even otherwise, I'm the one who's supposed to go. I don't even have a good shirt to wear. Your mom is a big tailor. She doesn’t even know how to stitch a shirt. Honey, you wait outside. I'm coming. Get going. Why are people wearing white shirts and all? - Let's go, Honey? - Yes. It's a PTA meeting in the school. And not a personal meeting with the class teacher. No need of teasing me. If I don't dress up well, it's a shame for her. Oh my gosh! My slipper isn't good. That's dad's slippers. Who do you think the shirt belongs to? Do you want me to buy anything? Do you want to go on the bicycle or walk? Let's walk. I'll hold it, dad. No problem. I'll hold it. Honey, Do you study well? Or will you embarrass me in front of your teachers? No way! I'm the class topper. I knew it. Honey, you're in 6-A or B? Gosh! Dad, I'm in 5-A. You must sit in the front seat for the meeting, OK? Why not? Aren't you, the class first? Class topper's dad will sit in the front seat itself. Dad, will you buy me a biriyani while going back? Yes, of course. You must sit in the front seat itself, OK? Yes, I will, Honey. You get in, I'll come soon. I'll come soon. Where are you going? I want to give a signature at Krishibhavan. Dad, the meeting is at 11 o' clock. I'll be back soon, you may get in. What's up? All good? Drive me home. If teachers are beaten, it's a different case, altogether. Police case? That's not an issue. I'll take care of it. He makes kids shave off their head and act plays every year. And do they get any prize? No! Leave aside those things. What are they doing with their annual funds? Do you see the flooring in here? All cracked and broken... There could be snakes inside these holes. You know it. It's for all these I wanted to beat him up. Dear Prasad, If we make an issue in here, our children are the ones who will be affected by it. Do you get it? That's not what I'm saying, Sir. Are we not sending our kids here, thinking that they will take good care of them? That's true. Your father hasn't come yet? No, he will come now, aunty. He will come. Don't you want to recite the prayer? You come. Don't worry, OK? He might have gone for some emergency. ♫ Like how a father caress his children, ♫ ♫ You, the light of knowledge illuminates our lives. ♫ ♫ You are present all over the universe, ♫ ♫ As an absolute truth. ♫ ♫ Like virtue, like a mom's love, ♫ ♫ You blend into our lives, always. ♫ ♫ Please bestow us with the clarity of thought. ♫ ♫ So that our hearts become a garden of love. ♫ ♫ Please live in our souls, ♫ ♫ so that the words of love sprout in the lips. ♫ ♫ You erase the darkness in our hearts. ♫ ♫ And show us the path of righteousness. ♫ ♫ You are the crux of life. ♫ ♫ You are the music of life. ♫ What's wrong with you, Meenu? I want my old table and not this. Isn't it good? Then, I'll give it to someone else. No! He's someone who even sold his daughter's study table for boozing. Be careful. He might sell you as well. So, you have money to buy these things. Has my girl slept? Has she slept? I have brought Biriyani for you. Come. Hey. Come on, let's eat Biriyani. Call my girl. Hey. Call her. Call her. We will sit here and eat. Biriyani is too good. It is from Sahodaran's hotel. Come on, I say. Call her. Honey. Has mom slept? Has mom slept? Why are you staring at me? It's yummy! Darling, you eat. You eat. Open your mouth. Eat it. Eat it, my love. Go and sit somewhere else, Murali. Eat it, sweety. Go sit somewhere else without harassing me. What harassment are you saying? I'm just giving you Biriyani. Eat the Biriyani, baby. Eat it, I say. What the fuck are you doing? Won't you eat if I give you? - Fucking eat it, I say. - Get lost. If you fucking touch me again... You have been harassing me since our marriage. If you interfere in my kid's matters, I'll kill you. People like you have this notion, that you can do anything to your wife after getting drunk. Once you realize that you will be beaten back, you will stop this nonsense. I'll put an end to it. I'll put an end to it. You are my wife. So, you can beat me. I bought it for you. You hit me, didn't you? Didn't you hit me, you bitch? Mom. He's taking Meenu's chain. Go catch him. - Murali, hang on. - What's it? Give Meenu's chain to me, and go. - Give her chain to me. - What chain? - Her chain... - I didn't take it. I told you I didn't take it. Give Meenu's chain, I say. I said, I didn't take it. Give her chain and go. Didn't I tell you that I didn't take it? What are you doing? Didn't I tell you that I haven't taken it? I didn't fucking take it. Mom, she's trying to kill me. Aren't you both trying to kill me? I'll show you... I'll show you, what I can do. You don't have to kill me. I'll kill myself. You will be happy... You will be happy if I die. Both of you together... are trying to ruin my life. This bitch... She thrashed me even yesterday. Do you know that? Do you fucking know that, Mom? All of you will be happy, if I die. You... she and dad... I took the chain to fix its round loop. You want to kill me, right? Hope I die in a shot. I'll not stay alive anymore. You don't have to poke me down. I'm going to die. Oh! Are you are grinding Chutney when I am going to die? Saina, Yes, Sis. When you start looking for a matrimony, You should tell your family to inquire if the groom has a nick-name. I fell in this trap just because I didn't know his nick-name. Even if you marry a thief, never marry a drunkard. I'll do only love marriage. That's good. You will have peace of mind at least until your love is over. They will reach only tomorrow? No, tonight! They had rang up. But only after midnight... Sis, there is a powder. What powder? Mix it in water and give it to him, he will stop drinking. Give whom? Murali? What about giving it a try? He needn't stop drinking without knowing about it. This is something to be stopped willingly. Are you a feminist? Ah! This is the place. Hold him. Take him inside. Be careful. I will take his dhoti and come. Lay him here. Sis, this is his dhoti. Sis, call us if you need anything. We will be around here. Whatever it is, it was a peaceful death. No one can resist the call of death. Well, Having a good physique is of no use. He's drunk most of the times. There won't be anything inside his body. Everything would have burnt out. He's a person who'd come to my studio yesterday with a few rubber sheets. Today he is dead. He was worried about having no income from stone mining. Vijayan had wished a lot to go to the Gulf. He should have gone. If so, he would have flourished. Pour some for Murali. Murali. Our assumptions are right. Everyone around us is talking about the same... that she is the reason why Vijayan died. I knew it before. Murali, don't go there right now. - Murali! - Just leave me, I say. Don't make it an issue. Hey, stop him. Go and stop him. He shouldn't go there. This is going to be a problem. What the fuck are you doing? Don't make problems in a mourning famlily. Do you know one thing? She's the one who killed him. You can talk about it later. You just come here. Get out of here. She killed him. I know that she killed him. She killed him. Santhosh. Charge him with Section 364 and 364-A along with 'Murder attempt'. Let him stay behind bars for some days. He will be alright if he's kept in the jail for some days. Is it in a mourning family, this drunkard is making so much trouble? Jaison. Hello. I'll come... hello... Why did he cut my call? You don't need to buy rice. I'll beat you, and break your face. I'll send people to beat her up. It seems like all other dogs have gone home. I've not gone home yet. I'm going too. Jaison. Jaison. Give me a little, please. Just a peg, please. If any of them sees... They won't see. Just a little... I'm shivering, please. Please move over. I'll get some for you. There are no free glasses over there. If they see... that's a problem. You drink it fast, and go, Murali. Hi. Could you give me some tea? No, there is no tea for you. You get out. I've money with me. But only 2 rupees. You can have it. From where did you steal it? I didn't steal. It's my money. Please give me some tea. Told you once that there's no tea. Get lost! Booze and tea is not a match. Get out, go. I feel dizzy, that's why... Could you give me some hot water? Didn't I ask you to get out? Murali. Hey. Why are you here? I can understand what you are saying. But I'm not able to stop it. You give it a try. I've tried a lot, dear. When I get up in the morning, if I don't get it... I feel quite disturbed.. Something like... difficulty in breathing... and I don't know... I know that she... Nobody likes me. That's because I drink, I know that. I've tried many times to stop it. I'm not able to control it. Can't you go for a job? That's not possible. No one gives a job to a drunkard. Dear, Drinking is not a bad thing. But, drinking to the extent of ruining your life is not good. In the end, nobody will be there for you. I know everything... I know everything, but... Everyone... advises me to be good. But no one has ever told me 'How'? I feel terrible for not being able to stop it. To stop drinking is actually easy. But controlling it is difficult. If you will behave properly... Will you get me a job here? What job could I get you? Anything is fine. - Let me tell you something? - Yes. Will you be good? If so, I will take you somewhere. Everything will be alright. Be positive. ♫ The burning red sun climbs up the craggy hills, ♫ ♫ It moves along the ridges to a far-off place. ♫ ♫ It wears a smile and, relentlessly walks ahead, ♫ ♫ To spread the light everywhere. ♫ ♫ The burning red sun climbs up the craggy hills, ♫ ♫ It moves along the ridges to a far-off place. ♫ ♫ It wears a smile and, relentlessly walks ahead, ♫ ♫ To spread the light everywhere. ♫ "Jeevan Care" De Addiction Centre, Meloor. ♫ It passes the dark cloud forests, and the squalling wind, ♫ ♫ With courage and endurance. ♫ ♫ The large wavy sea calls him back. ♫ ♫ But he moves ahead without listening to anything. ♫ Is it for making me stop drinking, you took me here in the name of a job? For both. You just come with me. - Is doctor there in the room? - Yes. You stay here. I'll meet the doctor and come. Pray well to God. Sir. Yes. Ah! Rajan. Come on in. Long time no see. I was busy with my work. - Have your seat. - No, Sir... Sit, my dear. Tell me. - How's life? - All good, Sir. Sir, I want to tell you something. Gosh! Yellow is My favourite colour. Have it. What were you saying? Sir, a guy from my place has come with me. Murali. He was a chronic drunkard. He says that he has stopped drinking. No way! He must be bluffing. That's not it, Sir. He got into a fight at his friend's mourning house. And he was in jail for over a month. He says that he is a changed person now. If you could give him a job, he will become good. Please help him, Sir. Should I take a risk? Sir, He's someone who's very close to me. He has a small daughter and all. He won't drink if he is here. Sir, please don't say 'no'. Ask him to come inside. Murali. Yes. Come, Murali. Sit. No, I'll stand here. Rajan told me everything. There's nothing to worry about. Murali, you must start working. We must always be engaged in something. I can arrange a job for you here. You won't make any problem, right? Never, I'll be good. I've promised him. What's with this messy look of yours? Can't you take a bath, and wear clean clothes? There are no vacant rooms here. Do one thing. There's a lodge nearby. Take a room for rent. Then, take a bath, wear good clothes, and come back immediately. Elsa, come in. He's Murali. He will be here for some days. Be positive. She's Dr. Elsa, my wife. She is taking care of the administration here. Do you have money with you? I've only 22 rupees with me. Dear, give him 2000 rupees. Write your name and signature here. Come on, write. My hands will shiver if I write. Rent is 500. Deposit is 500 again. If you damage anything inside the room, the deposit money will not be returned. Give me the cash. Take the cash out. Here is 1000 rupees. Go straight from here. And the second room's yours. - Alright. - OK. Here's the key. Take a bath first, and go to the doctor immediately. Go. - Aren't you coming? - I've to go urgently. You get going. Hey. Don't make problems. I won't drink anymore. I can't show my face in this place anymore. My condition is such that, I'm forced to hide my face in shame. I'd better kill him, and go to jail. At least, the people around us would be happy. Let him go to hell. Dammit! My hope that you will change for the better is lost now. I need my kid, at least. Your friends are not like you. They are taking care of their family despite drinking. My daughter is growing big. Anyone could abuse a drunkard's kid. But I will not let that happen to My kid. You wear clothes or not, my kid and I won't be here to see it. Come with me. Dear Suni, Please don't leave. Suni, I won't drink anymore. Suni, please... Dear... - Give my money back to me. - Why? Full of bed bugs, I can't sleep. Don't say nonsense. I'm saying the truth. It's full of bed bugs. - Get me my money. - But you just got in, right? - You go and see yourself. - I can't give you any money. Take out my money. What the hell are you doing? - Give my things back. - Take out my money. Hello! Hey! Give me a Rum. Our mind lies in our own hands. When, where, and with whom to open it up are decided by ourselves. Only we must decide on it. We should never open up our mind in an undesirable place. Do you get it? This is enough for today. We will continue it tomorrow. I hope you are taking your medicines on time, and practicing yoga without fail. Very good. - Do you feel like taking a small (peg) once in a while? - No. Oh! Very good. OK. Take care. I couldn't show up yesterday. My daughter was sick. We need to buy these medicines. We will send Murali for it. Murali. How is your daughter? She has difficulty in breathing. - She is taking medicines. - OK. Murali, you must go to the town urgently. There is a medical shop called Alshifa near the bus stand. Show this prescription to them. They will give you a medicine. - Don't I have to tell your name? - Yes, you can. Bring it here, and give it to Mam. You may give 4000 rupees to Murali. Don't we have an extra phone here? Give it to him. If so, we can ring him up, if anything comes up. Murali. Don't misuse the money for drinking. - I stopped drinking. - OK. Come with me, Murali. Earlier, I used to hit the bottle even without touchings. But after coming here, I became skinny eating rice soup and cereals. My wife has two brothers. They brought me here. I'm waiting to get out of here. What about me? I was a guy who lived a peaceful life, by working and boozing. It's the ward member who took me here. I'll surely take revenge on him as soon as I get out of here. Dear, 'Cheers' is the harmonious sound you get to hear, when two loving hearts kiss each other. That's true. It's so pleasing to hear it. If I could get a pint right now, I would add some soda and chilled ice into it, and would simply get sloshed. You must tell me if you need any touchings. I will send it from the canteen. Murali. Hey, Murali. Where are you heading to? - What? - Where are you going? Why the heck do you bother it? I'm sorry, Murali. - What Sorry? - Listen to me. So, you yourself know that what you did was wrong. - Murali, listen to me. - What's it that I must listen to? I had rang you up. - When did you call me? - Your fucking phone wasn't working. - Did you ring me up? - Yes, I did. I'd come to your house. Who'd you want to see at my house? Murali, please don't get angry. Listen to me. - Get your hands off me, Balu. - Please. I don't want to see you. Get lost. I have a lot of bloody friends. 32 days... It's 32 days that I spent in jail. Did anyone show up to bail me out of jail? Forget about the bail. Did any one of you come to see me at least? Murali, honestly speaking, I wanted to come. But, when people told me that you will improve if you stayed in jail for a few days, I was convinced. My bad. What an improvement! Do you know what all things happened in my life, because of what you said that day? My wife abandoned me... My daughter left me... I'm the person who doesn't have anyone at all. What did I tell, are you saying? Didn't you tell anything at all? Did I ever say that she'd killed him? Didn't you say so? Didn't you say that she'd killed him? Didn't you say that she'd killed him? When he got a chest pain, if she had called any one of us, we could take him to the hospital, and save him. Isn't it what I'd told, Murali? It is for that you made all the mess out there. So, it's now you are explaining things to me. At this late hour... after everyone has gone from my life. Everything goes wrong in my life. Yes, those two medicines itself. Yes. I'm at the medical shop. Yes, I'll come soon. You have no change at all, Murali. Are you here to change me? Murali. We will meet when I'm changed. But, I'm not able to sleep at all, doctor. I'm full of negative thoughts. Why are you thinking about unnecessary things? You just think about the flowers in the garden... the food in our canteen... Go see what veggies are there in the Sambhar today. Go! Go to the kitchen, and watch everything. - OK. - Then, you will feel better. Everything will be alright. My mom got sick. I was in the hospital overnight. Which mom of yours is sick? You are a person, who must be lying in the drains as a rotten dead-body. There is no use of treating people like you. Even otherwise, what good are you guys gonna do after being sober? Does anyone in this world have any benefits out of you? Tell me. There is no bad habit that we willfully can't change. But you should have the will. But you are not capable of doing it. I'm not gaining anything out of treating you. I'm saying it for everyone. Fake people like him can't be allowed inside homes. From today onwards, you neither have a job nor a treatment here. You must get out of here now. Get lost, you... Sir. What you want? Are you crying? After making everyone cry the entire life, are you crying your eyes out here? I don't want to see you crying. If you have to cry, go outside. No false tears of an awful person, like you should fall here. Hey. Keep it with you. If at all you have a realization, keep it as an asset. Or else, throw it away. Doctor, please... Will you believe me? I won't drink anymore. I swear I won't drink. Trust You? Is there anyone in this world who'd believe you? If at all there is someone, bring him here. Then, I'll treat you. Go. Sir... Get lost! Didn't you leave yet? No. I rang up all my folks. Nobody is ready to come. Nobody trusts me... since I'm a drunkard. Nobody understands me. I came just to give it to you and go. Full amount is not there. But I will pay it later. Murali. Give me your wife's number. There's no use of calling her. She will not come. Hello. Hello. Aren't you Murali's wife? I'm Sunitha. Who're you? Sunitha, I'm Dr.Subramaniam. Murali is there in my hospital now. Sunitha, can you come over here? I can't come. I have no relationship with him. Sunitha, Murali has a disease. He must be treated. Before the treatment, someone close to him must be here with him. That's why I'm telling you. You must come here. I'm safe in my house. My daughter too. I can't leave it, and come. It's difficult for me to see him rotting dead in the streets like stray dogs. Because, he is my daughter's father. If she happens to see it, she will get upset. I'm neither interested in living with him nor in giving birth to his children. I can't live with him as I don't love him. I will take care of my daughter all alone. But... If there is anything that I can do for helping him live like a human being, I am ready to do it. I will give my full support to you, doctor. It's on his wife's backbone, every drunkard in the world, hits freely after getting drunk. But in the end, these wives are the ones who take care of them. Like her. Nobody remembers it. Did you hear what she said just now? None of them needs you. You're the one who needs them. If you realize it, you can still come back to life. You may drink. Nobody's going to stop you. But if your drinking ruins the happiness and freedom of others around you... You are answerable for it. Weren't you easily ignoring her until now? Your own wife? Now on, your life is wholly dependent on her. You'd better keep it in mind, OK? ♫ You were the sky-light of my life. ♫ ♫ You flew away from me, beyond the horizon. ♫ ♫ You were my wings, my dear ♫ ♫ But, I failed to realize it until now. ♫ ♫ The shadow faded away. ♫ ♫ And I lost my way too. ♫ ♫ In the incessant rain in the night. ♫ ♫ As the light of my life had gone, ♫ ♫ The rhythm of my life got muddled up. ♫ ♫ And, I turned out to be nothing. ♫ You might feel sleepy.

I want it! I want it! Didn't I tell you not to drink it? Murali. - Lay him on the bed. - Hold his legs. Hold his legs. Lay him on the bed. Doctor. What happened to him? He drank spirit. ♫ You were the sky-light of my life. ♫ ♫ You flew away from me, beyond the horizon. ♫ ♫ You were my wings, my dear ♫ ♫ But, I failed to realize it until now. ♫ ♫ The shadow faded away. ♫ ♫ And I lost my way too. ♫ ♫ In the incessant rain in the night. ♫ ♫ As the light of my life had gone, ♫ ♫ The rhythm of my life got muddled up. ♫ ♫ And, I turned out to be nothing. ♫ ♫ I lost my body. ♫ ♫ I lost the love of my life. ♫ ♫ And my mind floats in tears. ♫ ♫ How long should I sail into the wind, all alone? ♫ ♫ Bearing the dreadful pain inside me. ♫ ♫ How far shall I flow ahead, ♫ ♪ With the memories from the past. ♫ ♫ To reach you to the shore. ♫ If I stay here any longer, he will start feeling love for me.

There is hardly anyone who doesn't drink. But among them, around 20% are diseased. They suffer from this mental disorder called Chronic Alcoholism. This disease can be cured only by treatment. If you cooperate with me, we will give it a try. No! No! The patient should know about the treatment. You needn't take him here without telling about it. Anyways, you come. We will talk eye-to-eye. Come over, Murali. Mam told me that you're here. I just wanted to meet you before going. You have become really smart. You should maintain this, OK? Or will you come back as before? No. Will you stop the medicines? No. I'll never bring shame on anyone. I'll not drink anymore. You're my God, doctor. Alright! Get going. Once you reach home, you should always be with Sunitha and kid. Family is our Paradise, isn't it? Can I give you a hug? See you. Unni. Unni, what's up? I need to go to the town urgently. The clothes kept outside are costly. If you want to go anywhere, close the shop. Nobody can be trusted these days. Fix buttons on it. Hey. What's up? I was hospitalized for a few days. That's why I couldn't meet up with you guys. I slowly stopped drinking. What's wrong with Unni? I'll call you back. Murali? I'll call you back. Is nobody here? Nobody is here. Are you not aware of it? The house property was sold. My son bought it. Faisi. Where is my family, then? Murali, are you asking it to me? Your family, you must be knowing it. Jaleel, Dear Jaleel, Could you give me a tender coconut? - Tender coconut? - I'm starving. Why do you want tender coconut? Add water and drink. Kannan. Keep an eye on the coconuts. His condition was really bad. Actually, now it's OK. BP levels are normal. Now, there is nothing to worry about. - Thank you, Doctor. - Thank you, Doctor. Murali is fine. But we are not. If a person has the will, he could easily stop drinking. Only that a good doctor, and proper medicines should be there. But the life of a person who has stopped drinking isn't completely in his hands. The society has a big role in it. He can have a good life only if his family and friends support him. We must always keep it in mind that alcoholism is a disease, and the person with us has just recovered from that disease. Suppose, there is a car driven by a person who has just recovered from a mental disorder. Would we daringly get into the car? Would anyone employ such a person? The same attitude is what we show to a person who has stopped drinking. He is treated as a drunkard until his death. From now, Murali's life is dependent on the love and care you show him. Love! Give him Love. He will surrender. No matter he's a deadly tusker! Length is 12.2. - Dear, I'm leaving. - OK. Bye, Honey. Dad, bring me something when you come back. Let me see. - Oh! You are leaving? - Yes. The bus is at 5.50. Sonny, take the water. OK, then. I'll be a little late to get back. ♫ I learnt how to live my life, in this world. ♫ ♫ Your happiness lies within yourself. ♫ ♫ This is a journey from the Earth to the Sky. ♫ ♫ Our success depends on our attitude. ♫ ♫ There's no happiness without our dear ones. ♫ ♫ Life is meaningless without them. ♫ ♫ Make up your mind, and be determined. ♫ ♫ Live for an aim, and follow your dreams. ♫ ♫ Make up your mind, and be determined. ♫ How many kilos? - A quarter will do. - Just a quarter? For 25 rupees! Normally, we don't sell in small quantities. ♫ Life is all about ups and downs. ♫ ♫ At times, you fall, and at times, you rise up. ♫ Ah! What's up, Murali? I stopped drinking and all. Could you get me a job? Show me your hands. See, it's shivering. What did you stop, you were saying? ♫ Make up your mind, and be determined. ♫ ♫ Live for an aim, and follow your dreams. ♫ Hello. Doctor, hello, are you busy? Hi, Murali. No, it's nothing... I'm really fed up. I knocked so many doors. But, I didn't land a job yet. I don't know what to do. Why don't you start a business of your own? What business do you mean? I have no money to invest. Aren't you the one who has the biggest investment? Didn't you get it? 'Insult' is the biggest investment in the world. In fact, the teacher who trains a failed person, pass the tests of life. Only those who were insulted have succeeded in life. ♫ I'm a droplet, sailing through a turbulent sea. ♫ I'll supply the load to whoever you tell. I'm happy that you are ready to give the load even after knowing that I have no money to invest. But, how do I take a risk? Only those who take risks will succeed in life. Here, Ain't I the one who's taking the risk? You may take the orders. I'll supply the load. - Are you sure? - It's my word. I shall never forget your help. ♫ The skies seek for a light along its paths. ♫ ♫ The light is somewhere far away from it. ♫ ♫ Though the sea is foaming and swirling ♫ ♫ It sails and sails ahead. ♫ ♫ I hug whichever shore, I reach. ♫ ♫ There's no stepping back as before. ♫ ♫ Though the sea is foaming and swirling ♫ ♫ The boat sails and sails ahead. ♫ ♫ I hug whichever shore, I reach. ♫ ♫ There's no stepping back as before. ♫ This is a Site Office. So, we can't make a decision. Our Boss is the one who must take a decision. It's better you meet him personally. How could I meet your Boss? He's next to this. You may go this way. Will you be a reference for me? I'm Sorry. You carry on, Murali. OK. - OK. - OK, Murali. We already have a bunch of good suppliers. There are no quality issues so far. For the same reason, we are not looking for new suppliers. Sir, I've high quality tiles with me. I can give you a good margin too. We are a new company. It's small. Please help us out, Sir. I'd like to help you. But, you come back with something new. What a customer needs is variety. Think of something new. And come with a variety. What did you say your name is? I'm Murali. Murali, bring me something different. Then, I'll give orders. ♫ The path was wretched, and the mind was burning. ♫ ♫ The days and nights were just passing away. ♫ ♫ There is a long way to sail about. ♫ ♫ When I land on my dreamland. ♫ ♫ When I open up new chapters of life. ♫ ♫ The entire universe conspire for my victory. ♫ ♫ Though the sea is foaming and swirling ♫ ♫ The boat sails and sails ahead. ♫ ♫ I hug whichever shore, I reach. ♫ ♫ There's no stepping back as before. ♫ ♫ Though the sea is foaming and swirling ♫ ♫ The boat sails and sails ahead. ♫ ♫ I hug whichever shore, I reach. ♫ ♫ There's no stepping back as before. ♫ Sir. Ha! Murali. You seem to be very energetic today. What's up? Any progress? Come on, take a seat. I'm glad, you remember my name. Yeah, very well. You'd come the other day, right? It's been sometime since then... Sir, my project is ready. Oh, good! Tell me what it is? Sir... Have you seen soil and water mating with each other? Have you seen it? What? The water and soil, over the years, commingle with each other, in the presence of natural wind and cold. And there's this product you get from the factory of nature. That's my project all about. Stop being poetic, and come to the matter. Before the advent of AC and fan, how did we build homes so as to regulate heat and cold? It's with Laterite stone bricks. Indigenous cut stones. That is the reason why our Bakel Fort is still standing strong. But, tell me what your innovation is all about. It's your words that made me, think differently. All that we need is already there in our surroundings. When we find it out, and make use of it, it becomes valuable. In fact, our life thrives on the soil we step on, and the water we take in. That's more than enough to build a life. The land we were born would never deceive us. It's the very same belief which took me to this idea. Your idea is awesome! It can be used as both floor tile and wall tile. It is super cool. Will it last? 10 years guarantee. Will you be able to supply large quantities? I can manage it, Sir. If so, let the first order be mine itself. Thank you, Sir. Come to the office. I can give the cheque only in the name of your company. So, write your company's name. - Do you have a pen? - No. Water man! There's variety in this name too. It has everything about me. May I come in? Yes. Doctor. Hi, how's life going on? Good, I'm quite happy. I'm here with a person. This is for you. This is my favourite colour. Still, you can have it. What were you saying, Murali? I've brought someone with me. His name's Chandran. He's an alcoholic. He says that he's stopped drinking. No way! He's bluffing. Yeah, I know it. That's why I took him here. He is facing some problem right now. I'd like you to treat him. The remaining part... I will take care. Do you want to take a risk, Murali? He's not as risky as me. He's got 2 daughters. He won't drink if he's here. Please don't put down my request. Call him inside. Chandran. Chandran, what's your problem? I don't have any problem, Sir. Everyone advices me to stop drinking. Once you start drinking, you can never stop it. Those who are claiming to have stopped drinking is just bluffing. What about giving it a try? If you don't believe me, you may try. I will take care of him. You carry on. OK, doctor. I will ring you up. Alright! Chandran, please sit here. Sit here. He will help you stop everything. How long have you been drinking? Murali is a person who came here with just Rs.22 in his pocket, 4-5 years ago. He was more alcoholic than you. Now, he has business across 22 countries. He's giving jobs to more than 20,000 people. Chandran, there is no bad habit that we willfully can't change. When you decide to win, you start winning. Murali, he's been calling for sometime. Yes. Murali, I hope you are not busy. No, no, what busyness? You may talk. You know, my younger daughter is getting married. Everything's more or less decided. But, if I could get your date, I could finalize it. You may fix the date. I'll be there. That's not it... They are asking for 100 Pavan of gold. We had given 50 Pavan each to both of her sisters. Don't get tensed, Ravi uncle. We can arrange it. It's our Sheena's marriage, right? When will you be free to come? If you could tell me a date in December, I could print the invitation letters accordingly. Please mark 25th and 26th on your calendar. And please lock Undappan inside the house for those two days. Mark 25th and 26th of December on your calendar. I'll be there.
