You're at, like, 191 and he's at, like, 259 or something? Yeah, yeah. Exactly. CNN. FOX. MSNBC. 589. 783. That's it. Well, what's-- what's in? Uh, 69%. Seems awfully early to call it. Sixty-nine percent. Unless they're looking and seeing that counties haven't come in-- Did they just call Ohio? Yeah, supposedly. Who called it, CNN? Well, if we don't have Colorado... ...it doesn't matter what happens in Ohio. Yeah, but I don't know yet from Colorado. We can-- we can wait a little bit. I mean, it's fine. It's just-- Let's not rush. Let's not do what Al Gore did and let things get bad and jump out in front of it. By the way, does somebody have a number for the President? - I do. - Okay. I hadn't thought about that. So what do you say if we... what do you think you say in a concession speech? - Papa? - Yeah? Make sure I don't hit the pole. I'll do my best, but if you get too close to the pole, you just jump out. - Okay? - Just jump? You just roll out. - You ready? - Not toward the pole. - Chloe! - No! It's okay. You can go on the next one. Just jump off. If you get to the pole, jump. - Okay, watch out, Chloe. - We're in a race. You can't just quit like that. - That's true. - Take one for the team. Is the pole the finish line? Yeah, the first one to the pole. On your mark, get set, go. We gave you new gloves last year so you don't have to wear the duct tape ones. I know, but these things work great. This is where I wanted to be! I thought you guys were on my side! We're going to go around the room. We're gonna vote? I'm gonna start there. We're gonna start there. I vote for McCain. Let's go around the room and get your thoughts. And it's going to be on, um, the, uh, reasons to do it, the reasons not to do it. - The pros and cons. - Pros and cons. It's kind of like when we went around and talked about our careers and what we're thinking, and we want the advice of the brothers. We kind of did the same thing. And it turned into something very natural even though it was kind of orderly. Well, now it's his turn to get... I'm getting advice. ...get his advice from the board. I think the con would be that you would be the president. Who wants to have to be the president? A giant con. - Talk about stress. - Yeah. - Talk about stress. - And scary situations. You'd be bald in about a month. I think Josh will be gray and bald just after the campaign. He gets so involved. I think emotionally it will just be hard on everybody... but it'll be an amazing experience. No pros? The thing that scares me most is that... you'll come out, and that message will be lost. People will either think it's too good to be true, or it's not-- it's just kind of a facade, but... I mean, I feel like if people really get to know who you are... it could be a successful campaign. As much as we've kind of all articulated the risks that we feel for our kids and for us, we stand strongly enough behind you that we want to be there for you. I remember talking to your dad before he passed away, and asked him, "Should I get into politics someday? What would be your advice?" And he said, "Don't do it." You have an opportunity now as a result of so many things that were beyond your control, to run, that it would be a shame not to at least try. And if you don't win, we'll still love you. The country may think of you as a laughingstock, and we'll know the truth, and that's okay. But I think you have a duty to your country and to God to see what comes of it. Do you mind if I shoot you guys? Ask you a couple of questions? Ask him. They're not from here. Did you know that you had a presidential candidate sitting right over there at that table? Actually we didn't. That is Mitt Romney. Does that name ring a bell? Sorry, guys, I'm running for President. They don't know who I am. I did see your commercial yesterday. Did you see my commercial yesterday? I haven't seen my commercial, so. - It looked very good. - Thank you. That's good. We're trying to guess which possible presidential candidate is here in Charleston, South Carolina. All my news I get from The Daily Show and Colbert Report, so... Can y'all give any hints? He's from Massachusetts. Oh, okay, yes. You're hot. You're getting hot. From Massachusetts. A presidential candidate from Massachusetts. No? Theo Epstein. It's a Republican. Okay. - A Republican-- - Romney? - Romney. - Never heard of him. You know, if I get beaten up, that goes with the territory. And I have looked, by the way, at what happens to anybody in this country who loses as the nominee of their party, who loses the General Election. They become a loser for life, all right? That's it. It's over. And-- and, you know-- Mike-- Mike Dukakis? He can't get a job mowing lawns, all right? I mean, it's-- I mean, we-- we just brutalize whoever loses, all right? And I know that, I know that, and so I'm going in with my eyes open. But I'm going in with my eyes open because I think it's really important, and I'm in this-- look, there are guys in this room who could run the country as well as I could. But I happen to be in this very funny position, having done a couple of things that put me in a position where I could do it. And if I don't do it, who the heck will? And so I'm gonna give it my all, and you're gonna give me all the money. Careful not to break my hair. You saw O Brother, Where Art Thou? You've never seen that movie? Oh, my gosh, that is the best movie. I'm sorry, I grew up in the South-- Best movie in America. Oh, you've got to see it. I know, but if I hear one more banjo, I'll have to kill myself. Deliverance. I just can't do it. The best lines-- the best political lines. You'll hear them the whole campaign. ...of all time. Oh, yeah. I've already quoted-- I've quoted at least two of them this morning. You've got to listen to the political lines. Listen to Pappy O'Daniel when he talks. "Just write my concession speech now." "Just go write my concession speech right now." "Okay, we'll go write the concession--" All done? Okay. No shine? - No shine. - Is that all right? That looks good. You know, the safe thing to do is just add a little more light, a little more light, a little more light. But that's leading us to the thing I always try and avoid. I try to avoid that flatness, and, uh... taking the safe route. I think, "Let's go for drama!" We live drama now, don't we? We do. Yeah. We don't want to offend anybody by showing off a flaw, you know, in the candidate or in the people that control his lighting, because implied in that is a mistake, and that means this guy could make a mistake when he's president, and we can't bear that idea. Of course he's gonna make a mistake when he's president. He's human. Governor, I'm sorry. I was supposed to be there face-to-face with you in Detroit or Dearborn this morning. Mother Nature had other ideas, so I apologize. I look forward to seeing you next time. Let's talk about some of the realities of the race, Governor. Let's talk about a recent poll said that 43% of Americans are not even sure who you are. Well, at this stage it's real early to have people know who I am. That's something which will develop over time. Papa! Hi, there! How you doing, Nicholas? - How you doing, buddy? - Hi, Greg. Hey, Nick! Hi, there, Joe-Joe. How you doing, buddy? Hi, there. Hi, there, sweetie. How you doing? Good to see you. Chloe, how are you doing, sweetie? Good to see you, love. Hi, there, Parker. How are you doing, Parker? Good to see Parker. Oh, yes, Parker. Oh, yes. Ready? Who's here? Dad. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. You're almost there! Oh, baby, how you doing? Hey, Benny, how you doing, buddy? Love ya. There's Josh! We got the whole gopher village. We got the whole gopher village. Look at these guys. Uh, cold and snowy. How you doing, Ben? Just terrific. Good. Can you lean back and talk like Fred Thompson? Well... I can understand that. Perfectly articulate at all times. Yeah, okay. Uh, how about lights? You guys look at the lights? We're doing that right now, sir. It is what it is. ...just to see what's happening, you will not see yourself. Good, yeah. Would you be more comfortable if the chair was up higher? Yeah, the higher the chair is, the better I'm gonna feel. Well, I do and I don't. My guess is it's already all the way up. That's actually how it was all designed-- the set, the cameras-- designed to make you guys look best because that's what Charlie wants. He wants to set up a topic at the dining room table and have you guys have a conversation about it. You're already having us planning on talking to each other. But we're not supposed to ask each other questions. You can. You're not coming prepared with questions. Pardon? We didn't say, "Please come prepared with a question for Senator McCain." We thought that was gimmicky. If you-- if in the course of the conversation there's, "Whoa, whoa, Senator, I respectfully disagree with that position. Is that really...?" That would be okay, but we're not, um-- That's asking questions of the candidates. Yeah. Okay. Well, you'd better clarify. Yeah, I'm being-- no, no, no. If we're allowed to ask other questions, "Senator McCain, why do you continue to persist in saying this and such? That's just not right." That is-- Charlie would not allow that. Not that kind of question. I'm sorry, I was not being clear. You're not going to pose a question where the debate is going to keep going that way. Charlie would come in at that point. But what he is looking for is to have you-- he's going to set up a topic, and he wants to see where the contrast is. There are no rules, so this is a scrum. Yeah. No, no, no, guys, if we're able to just have a conversation and he's gonna back out of it, then we can have a scrum. He's not gonna say, "Time out. That was too unfair a question. That was too harsh a question." No, no, no. Again, he's really not looking for a scrum. Well, he's not looking for a scrum, but if he's basically saying, "Look, I'm gonna raise a topic and let each of you speak on it," then I'm going to be talking about, for instance, let's take illegal immigration. I'm going to talk about my position and I'm going to say that the other guys have the following positions, and then they're going to say, "No, I don't." And then we're going to have a debate over whether they do or they don't. Except that he is prepared to prod the conversation along to keep it on target. It won't need to be prodded, if we're able to-- Well, that's known as an argument. - Or a scrum. - Or a scrum. Or a dining room table conversation. A dining room conversation is among members of the family. These are all people competing for the same job, all right? And trying to point out why they're the right one and the other guy's not. This is a very different setting than any of the debates that we've held so far. Well, they were all a debate of a certain kind, where people are asked questions and people responded to questions, with a good deal of dignity. I have a feeling that this format suggests a different outcome. Can you plug me in? How in the world do we find these things out on the day of the debate? This group has aimed a lot of partisan firepower at Hillary Clinton, but I'd like, if you don't mind, to adjust the outcome for a minute and walk down this road with me. Let's say that Barack Obama is the nominee He won the Iowa caucus. We have a WMUR poll out just tonight that shows it's tied here in New Hampshire, 33 to 33, and I'd like to know from you why not vote for Barack Obama, and not just because he's a Democrat. You're not allowed to say that. I'd like to hear some specifics on why not him. When we sit down and talk about change, Barack Obama and myself, in that final debate, as you're positing, I can say, not only can I talk change with you, I've lived it, in the private sector. For 25 years, I've brought change to company after company. In the Olympics, it was in trouble. I brought change. In Massachusetts, I brought change. I have done it. I have changed things, and that experience is what America is looking for. I just wanted to say to Governor Romney, we disagree on a lot of issues, but I agree, you are the candidate of change. Look, the difference I would have with Senator Obama has got to do with national security. I know Senator Obama, and I've worked with him many times, and I respect him, as I respect Senator Clinton. Senator Obama does not have the national security experience and background to lead this nation. Hillary Clinton and Bill Richardson and Senator Dodd and Senator Biden all made that same argument. And Barack Obama blew 'em away. And if you think making that argument as a Republican, that you have more experience and you've been around longer in the Senate, that that's somehow-- and that you know the Senate cloakroom better than he does-- that's not gonna work. He's not gonna beat Barack Obama with another long-term-- He proved that in-- that was proven in Iowa. Yeah, yeah. He just killed every other-- Barack Obama has changed our race. He's changed our prospects. Ready, and... action. I'm Mitt Romney. This is an important moment in our nation's history. How many more debates do I have to go to? I have one next week, in South Carolina. This doesn't make any sense. Does it make any sense to you? Mitt, you might not have to do it. How's that? I mean, I'm going to Michigan, for sure. He wants to kick my teeth in. Their campaign manager said he wants to shoot me in the groin. That's what he said. "I want to shoot him in the groin." And the next time he says, "I want to kick his teeth in." I mean, can you imagine? Go ahead. Ever once have you thought, "This just isn't worth it"? You know, it's hard for me to do these interviews because I'm so used to doing interviews with the media, where I'm so trained to say, "Absolutely not. This is such a, you know-- It's just been great to get to know the country," you know. That's so hard, but to actually speak my mind, it's very different. Okay, well, let's do this, then-- do the media version, and then translate what's really going on in your head. Okay, what's the media answer to that question? Remind me your question. Here, the question is, "Do you ever think, Well, is this worth it?" I just think the opportunity for someone like my dad to come in and run the country, and with the challenges we face in this country right now, to have someone with my dad's experience, his knowledge and his vision for America. Uh, someone that can, you know, come in and do this, you know, it's worth whatever it takes for us to get my dad into office. Translation: This is so awful. It's so hard. Um, I mean, you always hear about-- they talk and they say, "Oh, why can't we just get someone good to run for president?" And this is why. This is why you don't get good people running for president. I mean, what-- what better guy is there than my dad? You know, is he perfect? Absolutely not. He's made mistakes, he's done all sorts of things wrong, but, for goodness sakes, here's a brilliant guy, um, who's had-- his experience is turning things around, which is what we need in this country. It's like, this is the guy for the moment. And we're in this, and you just get beat up constantly. "Oh, Mitt Romney's a flip-flopper. He's this, he's that." And you just kind of go, "Man, is this worth it?" This is awful. So... that's the translation. I think it's, you know, barring some great success tonight, if we're virtually tied in the polls now and if all the newspapers are gonna be writing wonderful articles about why they should vote for John McCain tomorrow, or Tuesday, when people go to the polls... that's not a-- that's not a good thing. Maybe you just wait a few years. Yeah. Yeah, I've done it once, though. See? Look at this. Never again. We cannot do this again. You can only squeeze the blood out of that rock one time. One thing's for sure, though. You don't, um... you don't raise-- you don't put personal money in. See, we had to put personal money in to establish credibility and build a brand name. When this is over, I will have built a brand name. Yeah, but-- People will know me, they'll know what I stand for: The Flipping Mormon. The guy that'll say or do anything to get elected. - Oh, great. - Yeah, yeah. Quite a brand you've built. Yeah, exactly right. Our dear heavenly Father, once again we bow our knees and in all humility come before thee and ask thy help. We acknowledge all the blessings thou hast given us in our lives... and acknowledge the most extraordinary children that have been given to us, to be a guide and a comfort to us. We pray that... thou would understand that our desires in doing this... are pure, and that we are grateful for our blessings and have a desire to serve thee and to bring greater light to this earth. We pray that if it be thy will... that our desires may be... made manifest through thy Holy Ghost and through thy spirit to make this a possibility... ...is our prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Amen. Tagg did that on purpose. - Yeah! Jenn, I have to go downstairs. Nice prayer, Mom. It's gonna be okay. We'll be just fine. Okay, now I have red eyes from everything. You're not feeling like it. Okay. Good luck. We gotta run. - Come here. - What are you crying for? These aren't tears of sorrow. These are tears of gratitude. Not tears of sorrow at all. Our Republican presidential forum continues here on FOX News. Mike Huckabee, who served ten years as governor of Arkansas. Mitt Romney, former governor of the neighboring state of Massachusetts. And John McCain, now serving his fourth term as U.S. Senator from Arizona. Gentlemen, welcome. Let's get to it. When we talked earlier today, you said that in fact you think that your record as a flip-flopper pales in comparison to some of the other people here at the table. What I'd say is I'm certainly not the only person at this table that's changed their mind on a position, and I certainly would far be in favor of a person who has the willingness to say I was wrong and change their position and become right, than someone who is so stubborn as to say they're not going to change their position. I've spent my life in a place where I've been able to bring change. I will change Washington, to make sure that the America our kids inherit is every bit as great, even greater, than what we received from the Greatest Generation. Gentlemen, well, that's it for the FOX Republican presidential candidates forum. Now the analysis starts about what happened here tonight. First off, show of hands, how many of you walked in here without a committed candidate? Raise your hands. How many of you walked in here supporting Mitt Romney? Raise your hands. How many of you are going to leave here supporting Mitt Romney? I just believe that Mitt Romney has such presence, and he speaks right off the cuff, confident, and is very, very well versed. You knocked it dead! Hey. I wasn't feeling very good about it. Oh, my-- How many are for Mitt Romney after the debate? Twenty-eight. Every hand, every hand. You were fantastic. I've never seen a better debate. How did you feel on the stage? - I thought I was dying. Here comes Frank Luntz! The blue line represents moderates, and Mitt Romney consistently got the best responses of the entire evening. Two days to go, Mitt Romney hit a home run tonight. Brit, back to you. All right, Frank, thanks very much. Chris Wallace, the moderator of tonight's forum, will join us shortly for a debrief, but first, after a break... That is pretty rare. That is pretty rare. Thanks. We're messing his hair up! He's gonna fall asleep on his feet. Governor, is there a plan "B" if things don't go as you hope tomorrow? I'm planning on it going real well, thanks. I'm very excited about the prospect, and last night's debate gave me just the boost I need to take it over the top. Hillary Clinton beat Barack Obama? - Well, six percent in. - Seven. Yeah, but that's a bigger poll than I've ever seen. You ever seen a poll with 10,000 people in it? Yeah, but it's not a sample. What city? There's different parts of the state. Still. And mine's getting worse. Eight thousand votes. And 250. I'm sorry, it's getting worse. Ooh, that's not good. That's not good. Okay. The Flipping Mormon. I can't fix the Mormon side, or I won't fix the Mormon side. The flipping side... And that would hurt the flipping, too. Yes, that would, wouldn't it? The flipping side continues to be a problem, and I think it's the reason, by the way, twenty-seven papers here went along with it. I can't do anything. I mean, it's like, "Your speech has changed! See? You're flipping again!" It's like, "You can't change your stump speech?" That's a flip-flop, if you change your speech? I mean, it's literally, there's nothing I can do. "He was at Burger King last night, McDonald's the night before!" I mean, it's really-- is there-- is there any way-- I mean, do we put on my website what my positions are? Do we answer the flipping charges? And say, here-- you know-- this is what his position is on this. And it's like, That's where it is, and stop saying it. You know, it's like-- I mean, I keep-- you know, I keep hearing-- no, but I keep hearing, for instance, "You've changed your position on gay marriage." It's like, "Yeah, okay, I've changed my position." No, I haven't! But they keep saying it. And it's like, is there not some way of saying, "Stop buying the dog food that's been shipped to you from McCain"? I did not change my position on gay marriage. - He did. He did. Stop-- well, I'm not worried about that. Time heals all wounds. I'm not worried about that. Really, I'm not. By the time-- Ten years from now, no one'll even know. It's like, "Weren't you the guy that-- I can't remember." You know, it's-- I'm not worried. But it's-- it's so damaging to me... That's how we all remember Kerry. It's so damaging to me that-- that-- that, um... that I don't know that it's going to be that devastating in a place like Michigan. Is there any way...? And it's like trying to convince people that-- that-- that Dan Quayle is smart, all right? You're not gonna convince 'em that Dan Quayle is smart, or that Gerry Ford isn't a stumblebum. And maybe it's-- I gotta live with that. "Oh, you flip on everything." In which case, I think I'm a flawed candidate. You want me to sign that one? Good luck. We're counting on you. You must get down. You must get discouraged. And... but every time I see you, you're back up again. It's these pills I take. When I came as close as I did in both Iowa and New Hampshire, there's a greater sense of, "Come on, guys. Don't you get it?" Why don't we say, "Washington is broken." People said, "No, that doesn't sound right, that doesn't sound right." And, uh, you know, "I can turn it around." "No, don't use 'turnaround,' don't use 'Washington is broken.'" Now-- and so they didn't like that early on. They liked the idea of change. "Talk about change all the time." I said, "Well, change is such a trite word. It's used all the time." And Alex Castellanos, to his credit, said, "Just use it. It's good. Just say change." I said, "No, I've got to say something like 'Washington is broken.'" And so we battled a bit, and I used "change," but I used it in more of a philosophical way than I do now, and I make it more-- more direct. So you can tell a difference in listening to the speeches, is that right? Yeah, I-I thought there was, uh... A change? But cars have changed a lot since then, because in the places they make cars, you either make a better car or your competitor will, and he'll drive you out of business. You change and get better, or you're gone. And it's true throughout the private sector, whether you're selling insurance or selling shirts or making cars or whatever you do. You better always be making a better and better product or service, or somebody else will, and you'll be out of business. - Is he decent? - Is he decent? This is bad news, right? Is he decent? - Almost. - Is he in the bathtub? He's thinking if you're coming up-- I've got a robe on. I'm out of the bathtub. Thirty-five, twenty-nine, Romney! No, really? - Yeah, really. - Yeah. - Are you kidding? - No. Can I get a hug? I said to Ann, "I think we lost this one." Gosh. Unbelievable. We won one. Can you believe it? - Really? - Good job, Dad. It looks like we won one. Nice job. Oh, gosh. I can't believe I'm in this thing. Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Let's take this campaign to South Carolina and Nevada and Florida and all over the country. Let's take it all the way to the White House! So, we're walking back from dinner and, uh, I got a call from Will Ritter. And Will said that there was a news report that Charlie Crist, governor of Florida, had endorsed John McCain. And Charlie Crist had promised my dad multiple times that he was gonna stay neutral. He talked to many people on our campaign He promised 'em all that he was gonna stay neutral. And now he's announced that he's gonna endorse John McCain, and it's two days before the election. This is a big deal. It's a tight race, and it's probably enough to tip it in McCain's favor. Wow, isn't this fun? You do something like this, you call and say, "Look, I've made a decision." By the way, we've all talked to him and said, "Are you gonna endorse somebody?" And he said no. Don't you think now, if you lose here with dignity, which is that Crist and Martinez endorsed McCain. We were tied-- we were tied-- We were tied, and they came out and endorsed McCain, and-- and, um... you know, whatever he promised them. And, you know, we lost there, and that's just the way it is. Romney! Romney! Romney! Romney! Many of you know that Mitt Romney is my papa. But I also wouldn't be here if I didn't know that... ...he would make a great president. Thank you so much. ...right now leading in Tampa, leading along the coast in St. Petersburg, leading down in Sarasota. So, if these numbers hold, it looks like John McCain would win the state narrowly... We're getting beat everywhere. Yeah. ... the war hero who spent almost six years-- more than five years-- as a POW in Vietnam, the longtime Senator from Arizona, an important win for John McCain. In Florida right now, beating Mitt Romney, John McCain... Oh, this feels worse than usual. Not worse than Iowa. What am I gonna say, though? "Almost, but not quite." "Almost, but not quite." Six months ago we laughed at John McCain. - I know. - Laughed. And now he's-- now he's most likely the nominee. Even if he gets a majority of the votes on the 5th... ...there's still other states after that. It's-- it's not over yet. But you're gonna have to hit him. We've hit him with everything we've got. He ran a smart campaign. He's got a vision and room... He ran a smart campaign. He beat us. Why do you give up when you've got a chance? If you resign February 6th, fine, then do that. But until you're out, don't give up. No one sends a check in. You have to be asked at fundraisers, and I mean, it's just-- and who's gonna want to come to a big event for me? I mean, I didn't even want to go to events! "Let me tell you how I'm gonna win this!" It's like, oh, gosh, I can't-- I can't fake that. I don't blame you. I can't blame you. - You need to go to bed. - To bed. Let's go. We need to go to bed, and you need... Take care of whatever it takes to sleep. But you need to realize that you're the best candidate... - A year ago we told you... - ...and keep at it. ...that we'd love you no matter how this thing turned out, and... - Now you're not so sure. - Now we're not so sure! You saw right there, he wants us all to have given up. He doesn't want us holding on to any hope. He hates to disappoint, and so this is-- he's disappointed. He thinks he's disappointed the family and his supporters and all these people, and I think that kills him more than anything. And so, uh... hopefully he knows how proud we are. We basically just lost the presidency, and nobody's that upset. So... you know, I think it shows that... we wanted to win, yes, but... I mean, there's a lot of downside to winning. A lot of downside. And now we can avoid all that, and now just go back to our lives and be pretty happy, so, uh, you know what? I'm not too upset. Um, now we get to go on and do what we want to do and live our lives and have privacy and all that, so... this is not all bad. But I'll tell you something else: in four years, the country's gonna be in worse shape and gonna want to have a real rethinking. I do not believe-- there's people saying this is a changing of the Republican Party. That's not really what's happened here. That isn't-- that isn't-- We're doing the same thing we've always done-- get the old guy who's in line. That's exactly right, and the other thing is that there's malaise about Bush, and-- and-- and that's part of what's going on in this whole thing too. I got some real bad news. If that's the case... you're the next guy in line. That's right. You're the next guy in line in four years. Four years. They asked again today, some of our advisors did, would we think about doing it in four years. I think I need to write myself some notes as to why I would not want to do that again, on how difficult this is, and... just say, just remind myself, "If you're tempted, the answer's no. It's too much." My fellow Republicans... my fellow Americans... I am proud to introduce to you the next president of the United States of America, Mitt Romney! Mr. Chairman... and delegates, I accept your nomination for president of the United States! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Just three weeks ago, the former Massachusetts governor was center stage in Tampa, at the Republican National Convention, rallying his party and making his case for the presidency. But then... There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. There are 47% who are with him who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food... Mitt Romney was caught on camera criticizing 47% of Americans who don't pay income taxes, characterizing them as victims dependent upon government. The latest polls show President Obama with a 5-, 7-, sometimes 8-point lead in some battleground states, about a week and a half until the first presidential debate. So the question we've been hearing all week is, Can Mitt Romney survive the errors of the past few weeks, or has the train left the station? The comment about the 47% was telling. It was... given behind closed doors. But I think what's more telling are the policies that Governor Romney proposes because they fit in with that philosophy. You know, in a campaign, you make hundreds, maybe even thousands of speeches and interviews, and now and then things don't come out exactly the way you meant them. That may have happened to me tonight once or twice. We'll find out after the debate. But I can tell you this: My entire life has been devoted to helping a hundred per cent of the people. Breaks my heart to see the people in this country struggling under the policies of this president. We've got 43 months with unemployment above eight percent. That's the longest-- Nah, I'm not gonna go that way. Never mind. We've had 43 months above eight percent. We are about to have our first presidential debate against Barack Obama, October 3rd, 2012. Everyone in the world is watching. No pressure. I love you very much. Just get a little something in your tummy so you're not... So, any advice? Yes. Conviction, from your heart, as to why you're running. Conviction that... this country's on the wrong course and that you are able to put it on the right one. Conviction. Complete power from within your heart. That's all. We came into this really nervous. The polls have been not great. They've come back a little bit in the last couple of days, but there's a lot of pressure to do well at the debate tonight, and, uh, we were really nervous, um, just thinking about President Obama, he's a great speaker and, uh, just has-- you know, he has the mantel of the presidency. So do you think this debate's gonna be different from the others in that you'll be intimidated by the fact that he's president... Sure. Are you kidding? We shouldn't be intimidated. You should not be intimidated by him. I'm not joking, Mitt. He's a very good debater. He's a lot better than the other guys. He's a much more effective debater than they are. Watch his tapes. He does a very nice job. I feel like I would be a little intimidated, but I think Mom's right. Absolutely. You should not be, at all. My inclination-- see, I would be afraid to kind of stand up to him and afraid of how people would perceive you standing up to the president, but I think-- Oh, I think they expect me to. I think so too. I'm not worried about that. I represent the party that represents half the people in this country. I got selected by that party. I'm their nominee. And they're furious. And I'm gonna stand up to this guy 'cause he's taking us in the wrong direction I got no problem doing that. When I get intense, it looks like I'm angry and mad, you know, and my eyes are in caves anyway, so it looks like I'm being angry. Those are some of-- they showed some of your better moments in your debates, those are some of your better moments. You know, they showed you smacking down Newt Gingrich there. That was one of your best moments. I'll tell you, I'm good at smack down if I have a piece of information I can smack 'em down with. If it's just who can out-verbalize someone else... - Yeah. - ...I'm... no. But the information, you're prepared. Just shoot me an e-mail with those numbers? Yeah, what's the defense budget, you know, what's Medicare budget... Okay? Thanks. All righty. Okay, bye. The thing that I don't get is, how come they don't understand, like, how bad it is? Don't they get how bad it is, for the small business? I mean, they-- I think they put these things in place thinking they're gonna hurt the big guys and, you know, put it in place for the big banks and the big corporations, but don't they realize how much it hurts the 35... Thirty-five people. ...people, you know, employees? They don't know how hard it is. They don't know-- they have not been in a setting where you're trying to make it, where you've got a little business and you're trying to make it. They don't know how hard that is. They're all lawyers, aren't they? They're lawyers. They assume it's always there, and business is always there. They don't know that businesses fail, that people go out of business, that they lose their life savings, they lose their job, but they start over again, but they don't know how hard it is for a business to succeed, and they keep piling on more and more, thinking, "Well, that's okay, these guys will all do fine." At some point, they don't do fine. That's the-- But they, never having been there, they don't understand it. In those early days at Bain Capital, when we were investing in businesses like Sanborn-- you remember Sanborn, the centrifuge company? I agonized over that. Every night I thought about that. How are we gonna get that to succeed? It was just-- and you know what? It didn't make it. Finally went out of business. And it was like, Oh, boy. I'm beginning to realize I have a debate tonight. It's tonight, isn't it, that we're doing it? Mom, can I have some Chapstick on? Look, Mom, this is-- it's not opened yet. There was a bunch of 'em on that counter. Whoa! It's windy! The curtains are blowing. Oh, gosh, look at that garbage. Pull the curtains. Thank you. Wipe your hands when you're done, please, okay? This is all stinky. Can you get the door for me? We were admiring your purse. What is this? Go get 'em, Mom. ...not in the car, but he can film and then run into the family van. Is that all right? I'll be down in a second. Jackson, you're up. Ann. How are you feeling? Right now, very calm, actually. Looking outside, looking at the sun... feeling very calm. All right. Family members, we're gonna get you movin'. Ann. Ready to go? I'm about to pull the Guv if you're ready, John. - All right. - Are we ready? Here we go. All right. Got to keep moving to the elevators. Let's just get some, uh, dirge music so that Mitt's walking to his execution. - Off we go. - Off we go. Yeah, is that insane that they'd close a major freeway... During rush hour. For us, it is not today. People were having a fit tonight. The thing we most hoped as we were praying as a family was that people would see who my dad was, that they'd see the guy we know. That's what we wanted. Let's begin with jobs. What are... the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs? You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression Fast forward an hour, we're at the debate. First question, my dad just nails it. And a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, "Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He has lost his most recent job, and we've now just lost our home. Can you help us?" And the answer is yes, we can help, but it's gonna take a different path. And my dad just, one after the next, is just answering the questions directly with force, with power. About ten, 15 minutes into it, it's like, this is going well. This is going really well. An hour into it, it's like, This couldn't be going better. And it's like, Please end. End immediately. I was looking at the lady next to me. I kept looking at her watch. It's like... This has got to stop. And now, from the University of Denver, I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night. An hour and a half later, he just absolutely crushed it. They started off with a handshake and a smile. They wound up with a handshake and a smile, and now they're meeting their respective families at the end of this 90-minute debate, as you can see on the screen. The president actually spoke for more than four minutes... Way to go, Dad! Thank you. Good job, Guv. Great job, sir. Nice work. Nice work. We're running, we're running. Excellent job in there. God bless you! God bless you! ...gonna walk in real fast. Can I just ask you, like, how do you feel? Great. I mean, just like, relieved...? Is it like relief or joy or...? Yeah, come on in. Sitting presidents have a very hard time in these debates: George Herbert Walker did, George W. did, because they feel like, "Who is this whippersnapper coming up here that knows nothing? I'm president of the United States. I've been all over the world. I meet with world leaders. I'm the commander in chief. I know all these things." And they come in, this-- and so they don't prepare, they don't prepare, and they just think they can just waltz through it. 'Cause they've done the job. 'Cause they've done the job and they know everything. Then they get crushed in the first debate, as George W. did, as George Herbert Walker-- and then they come back from there. I don't think they got crushed as badly as he got crushed. No, I think you're right. Kerry barely won the first debate with George, and even in that debate, George Bush came across as more trustworthy. Kerry looked-- Kerry always looks pedantic. We will remind you of that fact four years from now. It's unbelievable. He'll be better next time. The guy who did him, Greg, was actually really good. But you can be better next time too. I've got a lot of good stories. I've got the guy that-- you know, electronics guy... Yeah? You know, the actual numbers on that, by the way, he had four employees, including himself and his son. He had to cut two away. He makes guitar amplifiers, the guy did. And he said they calculated 65% of what they earned went to government. Sixty-five percent. And he said, "We were blown away." We can't survive that! But again-- well, it's-- it's-- he said no one ever calculates it this way. It's federal income tax, FICA, payroll tax, state income tax, and then state sales tax. They did all their sales tax. Real estate tax. And, uh, what's the other tax? What about Social Security? Social Security, that's FICA. Yeah, I already... - Gasoline. - On gasoline. And gas tax. 'Cause, you know, you don't think about all those taxes. When you take all of the taxes together and then you look at how much money his business was making, he said, "Two-thirds of what we make goes to government. And it's like, you know, starting this business was high-risk. The chance of winning was, like, ten percent, so we're making a profit, and then they take two-thirds of it." He says that's crazy. I was with Papa John of Papa John's Pizza. He said, "I wouldn't start my company today. In this environment, I wouldn't do it." I write-- I write down-- they get pretty sprawly here. - You can see it. - Doodlies. That is amazing. I've learned that if I write too much on the paper, I won't be able to see it again. I'll get confused. - All three. - Mm-kay. That's what I start with: Dad. - Dad. - Wait, wait, wait. I want to-- will you explain that? What is this that I'm looking at? I just, uh, that's, um, that's my-- those are my notes from the, uh... And you write those when you get up there? When I get up there-- we didn't have any time this time. I didn't write as much as I normally do, but I normally write more when I get up there, just to remind me-- myself of things, but because we went into questions with no prep time, I just wrote down a couple of things. I wrote down "Dad." I always think about Dad and about-- about I'm standing on his shoulders. I would not be there-- there's no way I would be able to be running for president if Dad hadn't done what Dad did. He's the real deal. The guy was born in Mexico. You're the real deal. No. He didn't have a college degree. He became head of a car company and became a governor. I mean, it would have never entered my mind to be in politics. This guy-- how-- how can you go from his beginnings to think, "I can be head of a car company, I can run for governor, I can run for president"? I don't know how that gap-- all right? For me, I started where he ended up, all right? I started off with money and education and Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School. For me, it's moving that far. For him, it was like that. So, anyway, I write Dad's name down, remembering him, and then I have a little sun there. "Let your light so shine..." You guys want to take a debate ticket for your book of remembrance? Can we say a thank-you prayer? Our Father in heaven, we are thankful tonight to be able to gather after a successful day. We are thankful for the many blessings that have been bestowed upon us by virtue of the greatness of our parents. We love and appreciate them. We pray-- thank thee for Ann, my sweetheart, for her prayer and her blessing that she gives to me and to this effort. We're thankful for our loved ones throughout the world and for the great joy that we have to recognize that all of these things will pass away and thy kingdom and our families are that which will endure. We say these things with thankfulness in our hearts in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. She stabilizes my dad completely. I mean, she helps him have perspective and to unwind and to not get too worked up, and to be able to relax. That's, uh, that's one of her major strengths. When I first heard it, my dad told me on the phone, and I didn't believe it. I said, "Well, that's--" It just didn't make sense to me. This was my mom. She doesn't have multiple sclerosis. They've misdiagnosed her somehow. I think I was in denial, and didn't realize it, and a couple of weeks into it, I realized, "Wait, this is for real. She's really sick." And it hits you slowly. It was right around Thanksgiving time, and it was really hard. I mean, this is your mom. And it just happens to other people; it doesn't happen to you. And all of a sudden, it's happening to you! There have been studies that have shown that people who have MS, for some reason, respond well to riding horses, and they're not quite sure why it is. The real factor for her was being able to put her heart and soul into something, and to connect with them and go beyond herself, and so much of that helped pull her out of the depression that she was in over having her disease, and get beyond just concentrating on being sick and start concentrating on other things. It's when I get little twinges of fatigue or I get little twinges of pain or I get little-- then I think, "Oh, no! It's coming back!" So I'm always fearful that it will come back and ravage me, but, um, if I really stick to my guns and keep myself, you know, this program that I have, I do fine. And I just have to make sure to not get... too overwhelmed with all of the travel and all the things that happen in the campaign, that it gets me too fatigued, and I can do-- two or three days, I'm fine, on the campaign trail, and then, day three or four, I am drooping and feeling pretty wasted and really fatigued, and, um, you know, Mitt says, "Get back on your horse," and that's all it takes, honestly. It's just amazing. How 'bout I just take it? How 'bout I just take your tongue? Then you can't lick me. What am I gonna do with your tongue? I got it, though. Okay, here we go. I feel no pressure at all. I'm at complete peace about the whole thing. And, um... I'm very confident that Mitt is gonna win. I got it on, Garrett. I tied it, I tied it. You did, you were able to tie it. Well, sort of, kind of. I was just about to come see you. Frumpy, but I made it. Gosh, you look really good. You looked at me and you said, "You look good." You looked at her and you said, "You look really good." - Look at this. - She's gorgeous. It-- it looks pretty good, though. Yeah, it looks good. I wouldn't fool with it. I'm trying to iron something here, so... See, the cuff-- this is a new shirt, so the cuff is all funny, so I'm... Well, that fits you great. So I'm trying to-- I should have done this before I put it on, of course. Are you gonna iron it on you, seriously? - Of course. - Oh, my goodness. This, uh, this may not end well. I love it. Look at this. It's working. Ouch. It's sort of working. Ouch. Ouch. All right, that's good enough, Mitt. For goodness sakes. In the dark, you can't see wrinkles. You got the speech? Can I look at the speech? Okay. I have to go down and make sure I've got my lipstick. It is my great honor to welcome Mrs. Ann Romney... and the honorable Mitt Romney, former governor of the state of Massachusetts. And the honorable Barack Obama, 44th president of the United States of America! Well, you are right, a campaign can require a lot of wardrobe changes. Blue jeans in the morning, perhaps. A suit for a lunch fundraiser. Sport coat for dinner. But it's nice to finally relax and to wear what Ann and I wear around the house. The window seat on an overbooked cross-country flight? Don't mind if I do! I ordered myself a "stadium pal" and realized that while it might make sense in the hospital, it really wasn't very practical for day-to-day use. In an open-air sporting arena a piping hot 32-ounce bag of urine might go unnoticed. Um, are-- this is supposed to be foreign policy though, right? - No, the next one. - Oh, it is? This is just the Town Hall. This is supposed to be just a brawl. So this is-- and is it supposedly just the voters who are asking these questions, or are they--? Yeah, but Candy Crowley gets to pick the questions. She gets to pick the questions, but the rules are that she cannot participate or ask any follow-on questions. I'm just a little concerned that they've spent five days in debate prep. Doesn't matter. You know what? Then he's gonna be better than he was. There's no question he's gonna be better than he was. He was-- he was a disaster last time, and he will not be a disaster this time. But you know what? You won't, as long as-- You just do well yourself. Don't worry about how he does. - Just be yourself. - What you got there? Oh, the mother lode! Dad, it wasn't like he just lost last time. You won. Yeah, do what you did last time. It was awesome. Yeah, it's easy. Here's my hypothesis on the race. There are a lot of people who are disappointed in Obama and don't want to vote for him, but they're not sure if they can vote for you because they think that there's this bad caricature of you out there. Right. And the last debate was the first time they've seen, "Oh, wait a minute, maybe he's not." So tonight's just another chance for you to show that you're a good person with good ideas. That was Murphy's comment. My team thinks, no, I've got to be the aggressor. I've got to be out there prosecuting, pushing hard. - I agree. - Well, you-- you can't-- You can be a good guy and be pushing hard. I agree with your team. Do what your team says. They have a much better sense. You did it exactly right last time. He did both. He did both last time. You know, though, you've been more aggressive, I think, than in the last-- in the past, so you can do it. You've done it before. We can't give him any more advice. - I think it's a bad idea. - We must all be quiet. Oh, no, no, no, no. I appreciate the counsel and advice, I just don't listen to it. I'm kidding. I was reading John Kerry just went on a 10-minute tirade about you. He said-- the example he gave was, uh, that Romney's got elevators for his cars and in the State House he had his own personal elevator, which is rich, coming from John Kerry, of all people. But I will bet you the elevator comes up tonight. "It was for my wife's M.S., you A-hole." I would love just being asked the questions. That'd be great. It's all the things I've got to do: the moderator and Barack Obama and attack him. Stuart says, "Look, on each question, you've got to make a connection with the person that asks the question. Then, number two, you've got to answer the question. Then, number three, you've got to set the broader stage. Number four, you've got to attack Barack Obama so he has to respond to you." It's like, "I've got a minute." I mean, you know, that's 120 words. It's like, I can't do that. Again, I'm really, really glad that it's you and not me. I just-- and when I try-- when I try and do it, I can't do it. When I try and practice it, it's like I can't get all that stuff in. I can't do it all, and then I start speaking fast, and people say slow down. It's like, you know, all right, you've got to slow down and be calm. Don't speak so quickly. Well, he's not gonna do it either, in a minute. But I look at it and say, hey, if we come out where people say, "He did a good job, you know"-- our guys say we won, their guys say they won, fine. Yeah. All right, well, be a good boy for Kinsley, okay? I wish you a very happy birthday, and we appreciate all the work you're doing. I got him psyched up. It's like, old Obama's gonna tell us what he's gonna do. Oh. Hmm. Hmm. What am I gonna tell us we're gonna do? Remember to answer all the questions, but remember to tell us what we're gonna do. Bye. Is everybody else doing all right? The baby's okay? This is ABC World News with Diane Sawyer. Good evening on this Tuesday night. As we come on the air, President Obama and Governor Mitt Romney are preparing to head into the arena for their second big debate, and both men are on the ground just outside New York City. They know the power of one night in this race. You know, I think any of these attacks on wealth are something you can just deflect. This isn't about... The American people, they understood how I spend my money and how we're going to spend theirs. The president's-- the president's spending trillions of dollars of your money. - Love ya. - You're gonna do it, Dad. Love ya. Love ya. Love ya. You gonna still love me when it's over? Just like Michelle loved him. That's what she said to Barack on the stage. - Yeah, right. - "I still love you." That's right. Is there a bathroom in here, is that what this is? There's one back there, yes, sir. That's what it is? Yeah, okay. Thanks. Wow. Closing in, I want to still get a lot of people in. I want to ask you something, Mr. President, and then have the governor just quickly-- your Secretary of State, as I'm sure you know, has said that she takes full responsibility for the attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi. The day after the attack, Governor, I stood in the Rose Garden, and I told the American people and the world that we were gonna find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror, and I also said that we're gonna hunt down those who committed this crime. And the suggestion that anybody in my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive. That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as commander in chief. Governor, if you want to reply, just quickly, to this, please. I think it's interesting the president just said something which is that, on the day after the attack, he went in the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror. That's what I said. You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror. It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying? Please proceed, Governor. I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror. Get the transcript. He did in fact, sir. So let me call it an act of terror. Can you say that a little louder, Candy? He did call it an act of terror. It did as well take-- it did as well, uh, take two weeks or so for the whole idea of there being a riot out there about this tape to come out. You are correct about that. The administration-- the administration indicated that this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction. It did. It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group, and-- and to suggest-- am I incorrect in that regard? On Sunday, the, uh, your Secretary-- Excuse me. The ambassador to the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how this was a spontaneous reaction... I'm happy to have a longer conversation about foreign policy. Absolutely, but I want to move you on... Okay, I'm happy to do that, too. Well... how bad was it? What do you mean? It was. Tough format, though. It wasn't good. I thought we did really well. That question they got wrong-- that one thing he got wrong when he said he didn't say in the Rose Garden-- who briefed him on that? I just don't know who briefed him on that, but someone got it wrong. I just kept looking at my watch-- how many more minutes? It's just so painful for me. It is tough. Good job. Really good-- no, it was. He did a lot better this time. He did really well. You also did really well this time. It was not a win for him at all. Well, I'll bet it's 70-30 in the polls, so-- No. Yeah. Eighty-twenty? Ninety-ten? Republicans are gonna think you won, Democrats are gonna think he won. That's right. The CBS poll, if you're curious, is 37% Obama won, 30% you, and 33% tied. That's not bad. Good fight. Sixty-three percent. Thirty-seven percent Obama, 30% Dad, 33% tied. They both did well, then. That's exactly what you needed. Yeah, a draw. In this format, that's really good, I think. Yeah, that's exactly what you needed. The other thing is, you know, I wanted to come back and talk about him and his China stuff. She keeps interrupting me. "No, no, you can't talk about that." Why can't I talk about that? He talked about that. He talks about whatever the heck he wants to. I can't do that. Her excuse was the time, but that was irrelevant. But he had more time than you had. It didn't matter. It mattered who got to go last. But-- but he has this interesting point: "If Candy Crowley thought Romney was right in the spirit of the law, why--" which is what she said in her walk-back-- "why was she so aggressive correcting the letter of the law?" Yeah. Good point. I asked him whether he called the attack a terrorist attack. How are you wrong? How is that a misspeaking? How is that-- that's both technically right and in the spirit right, both. All of us complain there's no food at La Guardia airport. There is so much food in that food court to the left, you won't believe it. In the La Guardia Delta terminal, there is no food. What are you talking about? You're crazy. Mister-- Mr. Fly Private. Let me give you-- let me give you-- give you the reason. Can you look it up on your iPad? I'm gonna look it up right now. Look at terminal "E" or whatever it is. - But, uh... - It had a dining room? It's changed since you were there. You're thinking of the shuttle. The shuttle has one area with eight gates. But then the regular Delta has, like, twenty gates, and it's the other direction. You go through the same entry, same security, and you go left to the regular Delta. They have 20 gates and they have a huge food court. Tagg, just give up. You don't stand a chance. - Have you found it yet? - He's still debating. - He's got you! - That's right! Where was this guy tonight? Pretty good. Did you see it? Could you see it, Tagg? Yep. And you were wrong. I'll show you how I know. Yes. Look, I'll show you. I wouldn't cross him. Here's the map of the terminal. There's the Delta shuttle Marine Air Terminal right there. What Marine Air Terminal? That's the Delta shuttle. They moved the shuttle terminal to this little marine-- I'm talking about it's over here-- Over here is the Delta terminal that you cannot get to from the Delta shuttle-- I'm not talking about the Marine Air Terminal. I'm talking about over here. But this is where the shuttle is now. If you take the shuttle to Boston, it's out of the Marine Air Terminal. They've moved Delta over to the Marine air terminal? About eight years ago. That is true, that is true. Who is it? Oh, it's US Air. Is it US Air? It's US Air. - You're thinking US Air. - The US Air. I won a debate! You finally! You went down! Sweet dreams. Love ya. Take care. It was a good fight. You did great. It was-- - It was a difficult debate. - It was. That was-- that was tough. - And that threw you off. - And it threw me off. I was like, I was like, this is like your SAT you know when you, you know, three questions in a row you don't know the answer to, it's like, "Oh, no, I'm gonna flunk out. My life is over." Nope, nope, not at all. It was awesome. Let's go, guys. I told my dad, I said, "Dad, think of yourself like Rocky, and you're in the ring, and you're getting your face beat in, but you've got to show you can take a punch, and you gotta get up off the mat and keep fighting, and don't go down until this thing's over. And whether you win or not, you want to be known as a fighter. And this thing's far from over. Oh, my gosh, look at this. Are you guys watching this? - The doors opening. - Wow, that's cool. Hold on, hold on. - Don't look. - You're gonna miss it. Yeah, don't look. Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Wow. Wow! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! Mitt! It's wide open. Maybe we should start walking. What are you doing? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next president and first lady of the United States, Governor and Mrs. Romney! We want Mitt! We want Mitt! We have journeyed far and wide in this campaign together, for America's future, and now we're almost there. One final push, we'll be there. You know, it's some long days and some short nights, and now we are very, very close. The door to a brighter future is there, it's open, it's waiting for us. I need your vote, I need your work. Walk with me. Together, tomorrow is another day. Thank you. Good to see you again. Governor, how are you feeling today? - Who did you vote for? - Very good, very good. - Who did you vote for? - I think you know. - Good luck. - Thank you. Thanks much. Bye-bye, guys. - Good morning. - Hey, guys. Good luck to you, sir. Who did you vote for? Did you vote? Oh, my goodness. There are a lot of people out there. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there are a lot of people. I mean, usually it's empty in here, as you know. We come in, there's nobody here. There's a big line down the street. So people are turning out to vote. I talked to a radio host in Cleveland. He said the suburban voting places have long lines, much, much longer, he said, than when, um, John McCain ran four years ago. Yeah. Interesting. See you guys. See you, buddy. Love you. Take care. Allie, bye-bye. See you tonight. Jennifer. Wanna come with me to Cleveland? I'm leaving right now. See you guys. It's Morning Edition from NPR news. I'm Steve Inskeep. And I'm Renée Montagne. This is a day that many Americans will spend staring at maps of the United States. Some who are not staring already have the electoral map in their heads as they calculate ways that President Obama or Mitt Romney can win 270 electoral votes. In order to win, President Obama would need to hang on to painfully close leads in several states. Mitt Romney needs to win the states he leads narrowly and also capture a few states where the President leads. Tonight I want to speak about what lies ahead, about the tomorrow we can build together. That freedom, so integral to the American experience, will again propel us forward to new heights of discovery, to new horizons of opportunity, and to new dimensions of prosperity. We're-- anyway, you get the idea, you get the idea. Yeah! Yeah! What's going on, you guys? Huh? What up? Good to see you. Hey, buddy. How are you doing? - Good. - Doing good. We're doing well too. It's all good. Boy, these crowds. You're coming here. Joe Biden... We just saw his plane. Yeah, he was just leaving. They were talking about how we're desperate, you know, we're desperate, we're going out on election day. Funny thing. Funny thing, he's in Cleveland too. Strange. Janna reminds me of that every time. She does. She's like... yeah. How was the voting? It was, um, it was different, than my usual voting. Well. Welcome to Pittsburgh. This is our last campaign stop. It's our last campaign stop. Well, we'll see. There's probably a Chipotle around. This is our la-- This is our last-- I was suggesting to Ken we do an OTR at a bar on the way back. Guys, look at the parking garage. Look at the parking garage. Wow. Oh, my God. Look at this in here! Wow! Great to see you. Thanks for your work. Gosh, you guys are fabulous. Thank you so much. Hey, you guys, how are you. Thank you for fighting for my dad's business. Thanks so much, thank you. Hi. How are you? - Good to see you guys. - Yeah, hold on. Judy, hold on, he wants to talk to you. Hold on. That's my supervisor. Hey, Judy, this is Mitt Romney. How are you? Oh, wow. He look bigger in person. Hey, guys. How you doing? - Good, how are you? - Good to see you. - How you guys doing? - Wonderful, how are you? - I'm doing good, thanks. - Blowin' leaves. You're blowing leaves today? The sunshine is good in Ohio. It's a good day when it's sun-shining. I love the leaves when it's sun-shining outdoors. When I was a boy we used to burn the leaves. They don't do that anymore, of course. But we used to put them in front of the street, you know, and burn them, and they'd smoke. I love the smell. How you doing? This your son? Can you hold that for me, for the car? Mitt and I want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for this great effort, and I just want to introduce to you, because of your hard work, the next President of the United States, Mitt Romney. You know I always slept well before an election. That's because I knew I'd given everything, so I didn't worry, I did everything I could, and after that it's out of my hands. That's what I feel. Left it all on the field. Traffic is unbelievable. Is it real-- Can-- can you see it? - You see it out there? - Oh, my goodness! And it just goes on and on and on. Way down there. They've shut down the roads. - Why? - At five. Why? Secret Service has everything shut down as if you're the president of the United States. Queen for a day. ABC News live coverage of Election Night 2012. No surprises yet in the presidential race. The big battleground states are still out. We are here with our entire team of experts and analysts. We have our reporters out in the battleground states. The two of you have been there at this very moment. What's going on upstairs where the candidates are? What are they saying to each other at this moment? I feel like I need to lay down on the ground and throw up. Get him some ice water. How is everyone so calm? Oh, my gosh. I'm just dying. It's finally hitting me. - Get the panic out. - Panicsville. I really want to go slap him in the face right now. Slap me, hard as you can. Go for it. Lay it on me. Go for it. I need one on the other side. Match it up. Match it up. That's pretty good. Funny. Right now CNN has you, you're up by 500 votes. - Where? - That's not good. - Florida. - That's not good. A squeaker in Florida, Ohio, there's just no way. I know. It was up, like, six points, and we were hoping for Pennsylvania or Michigan. - I mean, you know, hoping. - Yeah. Both called. I wonder what the story is in Wisconsin. Oh, that's probably gone too. Did you know you know that you lost Wisconsin? Chloe, we're not coming in with updates. There we go. There we go. Okay. Did that just get reported? It's okay. You can give us updates. I want to know the states that we win and lose. Right? Nope. Chloe. No updates. Don't. Mmm. Look at this trash here. Whose stuff is this, do you know? Some of those are mine. So far George Allen is up two percent. Ninety-six percent in. Oh, that's good to hear. That's amazing, is what that is. That's really amazing. - You get 'em to sleep? - They're asleep. Wow, good job. Wow. Amazing. Wow. Wow, that's too bad. Boy, all those states, huh? Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada. Well, so the-- our only hope is Ohio. Right? Yeah. We're hanging our hat on one state. All right, bye. Yeah. Yep. I just can't believe you're going to lose. Doesn't it make-- it makes your life a lot better, doesn't it? Yeah, but still I just don't believe it's possible that you can lose. It doesn't change your life, does it? Ben? Hmm? No. The pathway still is, you know, Florida and, uh, Virginia, which is really close. And Ohio, which they're still feeling good about, 'cause it's still just absentee ballots right now. And then we've got to pick off Colorado or Iowa or New Hampshire or Nevada. It comes down to Ohio, folks. It does, it does. Ohio. You know, we talked to Senator Portman. He thinks that we're going to have a margin that we can't catch up to in Ohio. We might come up just short there. And so, we don't want you to look like some-- you know, John Kerry... Hangin' on, you mean? Hangin' on. Like Newt Gingrich. Yeah. We just want to do it right, for you and-- Ed talked to Karl. Karl is the last of the guys out there fighting, and Karl knows now that the numbers aren't there, and he's going to speak now and... He's gonna make clear on FOX News that, the Ohio numbers, we can't catch up with what's coming in. Okay. So what do you say? What do you think you say in a concession speech? Let me read you what I have here and see what you think. I've just called President Obama to congratulate him on his victory. His supporters and his campaign also deserve congratulations. I wish all of them well, particularly the president and the first lady and their daughters. This is a time of great challenges for America and I pray that the President will be successful in guiding the nation. No one's listening. I was following. I was following you. Shall I send you this? Do you want me to send it to you? Shall I do that? - Then we can-- - What's going on? We're writing a concession speech. - It's finished? - Yeah. Can you be gracious and still say what you think? I hope so, but... Because I don't-- What's--? I mean... I don't know the story. Obviously you don't want him to look like a jerk, but he's in this race because he's passionate about what he believes in. Why not say, "This is what I believe"? No one thinks he just spent two years because he doesn't believe in it. And there's tomorrow and there's the next day and there's-- But what? For what? To go out and make the case. I mean-- He's not going to run for anything again. That's for sure. To make the case. How would I make the case? Where? My time on the stage is over, guys. I mean, I'm happy for the time I had there, but my time is over. I think you're under-- How-- but to do what? We're done. I think there's almost a pastoral role you're playing in the political world, and... the... and part of what you're playing, I think... ...is soothing people. I... yeah. Okay. That's-- I don't think this is a time for soothing and "everything's fine." I think this is a time for, "This is really serious, guys. This is really serious." To get up and soothe is not-- is not my inclination. I cannot believe that he's an aberration in the country. I believe we're following the same path of every other great nation, which is we're following greater government, money, tax the rich people, promise more stuff to everybody, borrow until you go over a cliff. And that's-- and that's-- and I think-- I think we have a very high risk of reaching that tipping point sometime in the next five years. I'm just-- I'm just-- And the idea of saying, "Hey, It's fine, don't worry about it." No, it's really not. This election is over, but our principles endure. I believe the principles upon which this nation was founded are the only sure guide to a resurgent economy and to renewed greatness. Ann and I join with you to earnestly pray for him and for this great nation. We're 593 words, so that's about six minutes. Probably be a lot of applause. How long are you aiming for? That's fine. I think that's fine. Don't you think that's fine? Hey. Hey, Matt. Don't do it yet? Okay. All right, how long do you think? Okay. All right, we'll hold tight. Rhoades says don't do it yet. "Don't do it" meaning "don't call Obama yet"? - Don't call the president yet. - Why? They all just called and said don't call the president yet. - Why? - I don't know. It's not over yet. Premature. Why, if we lost Ohio? Well, he's saying we-- there's a chance we'll still win Ohio. This is not what they're reporting in Ohio. Doesn't sound like there's a very good chance, and that's the issue for me. Tell them to wait. Karl Rove is redoing the Ohio map. You're, uh, you're up in the popular vote, by the way. Mmm. Yeah, we haven't gotten California yet. Well, even reporters like Ben Smith and people are saying it's crazy for Romney to rush to concede. - Prolong the agony. - Prolong the agony. Did you call it? - It's 12:04. - What about Colorado? We're down four points in Colorado. Four points? I think it's time. May I use the house phone? It's okay, honey, it's okay. Garrett? He was just in the hallway. I was just going to tell you, you know, my-- my own view of the Secret Service is, I want to get a ride home tomorrow 'cause I don't have a car to get there, but then pull up stakes. I have no interest in having them stay around for any more time. Yeah. You know, I think you should go with what they suggest in terms... they'll pare it back. The idea of them driving me one mile once I'm home-- I... it's like, I will feel ridiculous. We need to hold for just a second. Okay. We'll hang on. Then we'll start... calling out... Um, it's been an amazing honor uh, that-- to work with someone like the Guv, of such high character. Um, he's a true, you know, he's a role model to me. You know, it goes without saying I'd rather lose with this guy than win with anybody else. It's a real honor. Governor Mitt Romney. I won't quote him by name. He's here, but he said to me, he said, "You know, Mitt," he said, in some ways we kind of had to steal the Republican nomination because our party is Southern, evangelical and populist. And you're-- and you're Northern, and you're Mormon and you're rich. - And these things... ...these do not match well with our party. Let me just note a couple of other things, and that is, um, I have long since learned that the, uh, greatest source of, um, of true wealth in life is the associations you have with other human beings. Uh, most importantly the person you fall in love with, your family, uh, but also the people you work with and that become your friends. We want you to have a glorious life. We want you to be successful in whatever you choose to do. And we want you to be effective in helping pass along a nation which is more free and more prosperous than we found it. He has to leave at five. It's funny, it is like at a funeral, which is that the family, you know, you've gone through your mourning, and you stand there and shake hands with other people coming through, and when they see you, they weep, they break down, because they haven't, you know... - They haven't mourned. - They haven't mourned yet. And as the family, it's like, "Yeah, I can't mourn any more." Boo-hoo! - That's enough! Sir, it was my pleasure. Absolutely, it was. Thank you. Thanks for taking care of her. I worried about her, but with you guys around... No problems. You've got a sense of normalcy. - We do. - Yeah, yeah, that's true. Well, we enjoyed every minute of it. - It was an honor. - God bless. Thanks, guys. - Bye-bye. - Take care.
