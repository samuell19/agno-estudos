About your death. It's about your death. They accomplish the painful duty of participating. Accomplish, duty of participating. Your death. And if my father died? If my father died, she asked. Surprised as if for the first time such idea had occurred to her. But what she saw, was an old house falling apart in slow motion, and her father's lips slowly moving. Repeating his last movements. It was a projection, it was a ghost imitating the echo of his own voice. She knew it, and she wouldn't stop dictating me about the meaning of it all. I don't get you, you are always talking about death and you don't die. Maybe my stare, maybe it's not that fixed and sharp stare of the daughter that deserves the father that she has. I was always at your mercy. He talked about death and he wouldn't die. Lived for that, to perpetuate his absence, to celebrate it day after day. To keep alive his recumbent statue. Stop with the replicas you said. I almost don't know how to speak, I don't have my own words. But I think, I think about your death. I know I should hurry, that I don't have a minute to waste. I know that these are your final moments and I search for a replica. I steal from you a replica that reduces you to my silence. Contrary to what you think, your pedagogic system nailed it. This that I am is the result of your education and of my obedience. Everyday since youth you would do her the dictation. Spelled the words one by one. Dictating words that she learn't to spell without a single mistake. Which made you proud, because it was you who said them. You were from the beginning the main subject of our conversations, of our thoughts. You smile, you recognize yourself in us, you recognize me as your daughter. Fathers, don't upset your children but educate them in discipline and correction. Sons, honor your father to achieve happiness and have a long life on earth. We debate, in its most tiny details, this process that exists between you and us. We resort to jokes, to seriousness, to love, to obstinacy, to cholera, to hate, to dedication, to the feeling of guilt. We used our full efforts from our head and heart to settle that terrible process in which you always thought yourself as judge. When you are only one of the parts, so weak and so blind as any one of us. Weaker and blinder than me because you are dead. When he dies, I' ll grief. The daughter. The greased family comes to thank by this means, those who came to watch. Dead you are, already dead. Your wife arranged masses for your soul. Liberated herself from you, betrayed you. You didn't like. Fatally. And your daughter, calm, arranged the rest. Followed you to your last address, buried you. If my father died, she dreams. It's like a prisoner that intends to invade himself. Maybe he succeeds. That he will let himself be free. But he projects to make his prison a nice place. Now, if he pretends to invade himself, he can't think of remodeling the prison. He can't think of remodeling the prison. The President Ant칩nio Oliveira Salzar. Died at 9 o'clock and 15 minutes, morning of today. 27 of July, 1970. Gentle Costume. Maybe it's my thing. In the last hour, there is gonna always be something that delays me. It's obvious that if I already resolved anything, something will be a delay. Maybe it's the house, the maid, life. See, with a day like this, already the lights on, and there closed. The others wait. Everyone dependent on him. It's our destiny. We came to the world to this. Always sacrificed. Don't let the sun touch the furniture, it burns everything. We have to close this window. I'm sick of saying this but no one gives me attention. This world is already as it can't be seen. And this plants, they don't have water. For how long have they not been watered? I have to remember everything. I would like to know what would be of this house without me. Go inside and see if he is going to take too long. If you are ready it's best to leave. In this house nobody has routine. You never think what he means to do. If I know, if I don't... always this prison. The others are right. Don't give them any attention. And they aren't less appreciated for that. I have been sacrificing all my life. Only God knows. It's better not to talk. He brought to our knowledge a prudent and saving direction. He accustomed us to the spiritual concentration and the material renounce. He cheered us to suffer with cargo all the sacrifices that this hour demands. My dust, my dust that accumulates in these furnitures. I think that in my time it wasn't like this. So it is our obligation to fully obey to become invincible. Without a spirit of obedience, We never perform our sacred duties of intelligence. And obeying to the boss, it's obeying to the instinct of an eternal Portugal. I don't wait any longer. I don't have the age to put myself through this. And I? I don't have to subdue... It's forbidden to enter your grandmother's room. Those drawers are such a mess. But someone go tell her that. Your father always gives her reason. It's useless to talk and I already gave up. Go inside, see if you find out what he is thinking. You are leaving? I am also going, I also want to go. I'm ready, I want to catch some air. - You will stay there quiet. It's not the weather to go out. - Worse than a child. Don't take too long. Where are they? Let me do this. - Go inside because you can get cold. Give me a spring. - And if you go to your room, wouldn't that be better? Hey, what time is it? It's 10 kings to half a coin. 10 kings... to half a coin? Always a smile. A delightful face to everyone. When I walked in the gardens, surrounded by maids. What time is it? It's almost time to lunch. - Time to lunch? What happened to him? 10 kings... Who knows, I told you not to take long. Poor one... It's time to lunch. The price was sleeping oh, the rested sleepiness. But in this, a gunfire. Fired at they eye of the father. Little saint. That we feel pity. Poor little saint. That sleeps. Blond child, without his father. Without his eye. So much pity. He slept. But he had an ominous dream. Oh oh, oh oh. I'm the grandmother. Could go to the window... - And look at the flowers of his garden. Those are the only flowers he likes. Carnivorous flowers. And there was a miniature plane flying over the garden. A swallow. - A swallow... a vulture, the raven of the city. Aeromodelling? - And this plane enters his window. It would be better if it blows up. That doesn't solve anything. - This one is against violence. It's a waste. - He is a pacifist. I'm for the mass. If he went to the mass we would put a guy in a priest costume, and give him the extreme unction. Extreme unction? A poisoned hole bread. He and the priests... It's a persecution mania. - It's to counter my mother. You think so? - No, it's more than that. Then everybody goes its away. Mother to hers and dad to hell. Naughty. You are already seeing your father's beard burning. The mustache... For me it looks like a good poison... a real poison... A good blowpipe and that's it! It's an ancient idea of mine. - Hum. It's fast and silent. And the suspects?. And I ask myself if they would do the same for us. Like, if we could manage it. It would work better in the thicket wilderness. You don't see nothing straight ahead. And far away, tan tan!, and the war cried. Those are the red skins. - It's all the same thing. Which side who knows... Africa is very hot... Right... A silenced rifle is much better than that. It never misses the target. And it's more discreet. In our times it would be a bomb, and that would be it. Yeah, the red legion. I never joined that. One more place to serve. I came here for the defence of human rights. Trust in the virgin... Nothing more perfect was ever invented... Easy to make, easy to transport, easy to use. Even a child learns. Many entered and left my house. My mother is so sad, hanged by my fathers jacket. Him running down the stairs. "Stop with that Ant칩nio, you will hurt yourself, and us too." "You could die Ant칩nio!" And he died. The young must settle things the right way. You are greasing. - Which way? Ah, as always. No, not today. Even the weather changed. And for worse. Rain, floods. Some sun is a miracle. It's the weather being confused. For me, F치tima's miracle is enough. The times change. And the poisoned book? The book that he will read from the first to the last line. Licks his finger to the turn of every page. Comes in the 'Arabian Nights'. It is a story that I remember. I know, he is dead arriving at the last page. The last page? That's waiting too long. He is dead as soon as people start talking about him. Like this, he doesn't even know. His mouth watering of anger. Of the poison, like this. Down in front of the photograph. His own photograph. He already guessed who it isn't. The dogs of the national revolution! The perfect crime! Five tomes, five! And you? Any ideas? You don't say anything. Well, when he went to the cinema we could project... He would never go to the cinema... We have a doctrine and we are a force. As a force, we must rule. We have a mandate of a powerful revolution. With no oppositions and with the country's consecration. Adepts of a doctrine. And we care being intransigent. In the defense, and the directing of the principles that constitute it. In these circumstances, there are no agreements. No transitions or disagreements are possible. He wasn't spoken of yet. When Gomes da Costa entered Lisbon, following the 28th of May. I went with my father to the avenue where the troops celebrated. We hardly distinguished the old general, but my father who believed in his abilities, of saving the republic, and the democracy, yelled: "The time's are of the army." Salazar, Salazar, Salazar! I am the president of the republic and the minister of the navy. The faithful and the soldiers. People from the Minho and Portugal. We mark today 10 years, in this same city. From the orders of Gomes da Costa, optimism and bravery were not virtues. Because they came directly from the soul, as a demand from the own's nature. The Portuguese army started the triumphant right, without a fight. Glorious, without blood, because in the truth, the voice of command. Was only the military expression of an irreversible order of the nation. And the new age began. Here's now what happened. To the souls haunted by doubt and negativism of the century. We search to bring back comfort of the great facts. We don't argue God and the virtue. We don't argue the nation and it's history. We don't argue authority and it's prestige. We don't argue family and it's morals. We don't argue the glory of work and it's duty. We won't leave here without knowing who has the courage to follow us. Everyone! - Everyone! Death is the operation of surprise to the enemy. True acts of bravery from the boys. We had several casualties, and now we enjoy some well deserved vacations. I'm ready for what's to come. I'm used to the weather. We get used to everything. And this life of adventure doesn't stop pleasing. The heat is worse, the cracking heat. Every time I can I shower with it. First burning then freezing. Nothing is better. As soon as I am in my room, limp. Wouldn't withstand the clothes. Now for example, I am... What impresses the most is the majesty of the landscape. This is too big for me. You have no idea. Everything grows quick and a lot. It's the heat. We spend our days drinking. I am starting to gain the addiction. It's a way of forgetting the fear, the weaknesses and the fears. We remember Oliveira? Died in an ambush. Betraying friend, you never know when the treason attacks. We must always be alert. Everything about that on papers is little. It doesn't even give a small idea. If you see the photograph that I have here, you would die frightened. You'll see it after, close to me, so you won't get frightened. I go forward and I don't want to think in anything else. Going away from here alive, the future is ours. Show here! No! It's for me. For me! Show me! Don't be silly! Let me see, c'mon! Let me go! C'mon don't be silly! - Drop it! Ok! This joke's over. C'mon let me go! Show it! Let go! Don't be silly, show me. Let go! Let go! What are you pulling? Let go! Let go. Let go! Don't look at me like that. That was your fault. Why did you mess with me again? Am I not sick of telling you not to mess with my life? It is your fault! Isn't the letter for me? The letter is mine! Are you jealous? You are capable of that. Why did you want to read the letter? To laugh, to joke? You think I don't know what I'm saying? You are a pit of poison! You came to this world only to upset others. Those who treat you well, that like you and that sacrifice for you and fill you with pampering! Oh, so sorry, you are upset. You don't do anything for anybody, you don't like anyone, you are a dog that knows no owner! And I have the obligation to deal with the girl that even makes fun of me. Isn't it enough my life, the relationships that I have? Dealing with girls all day. From morning to night! Insubordinate girls that think they are somebody. That think they know more than the old. That contradict the professors, give them lessons! They should go home to study and not walking around who knows where. Reading everything they shouldn't! Then at home they are as her. She likes disorder, chaos. I don't even want to see. Probably would end up showing the letter. She even talks bad of the cousin! Nobody is good enough for her. Only her is good, only her is intelligent. To be a mother you need intelligence! The letter was mine, sent to me, and she rips it! If I did the same to her stuff, I would like to see if she liked it. What she has is caress. I her caressed too much! If she had my educations... an iron fist! She came late, that was her luck. Only thing I know is that I am always the victim. In this house I am always the victim! The victim! Always the victim. Victim... Always... So, what does he say? Oh, what can he tell? Pretty stuff... - Thank God he still has health. If he doesn't take care of his own health, God won't help him much. In the papers it comes every day. - It's a matter of saying. He is in good health, that's what matters. In the papers it comes everyday asking for a godmother, if I had time and were younger, of course... - Oh woman, who hears you would think you are full of work! But still has time to read the paper. Capable of dying with the work she has. That of the godmothers is a good story... Only one more drop... I have also been by that and I don't have any godmother. Grandmother or godfather! Always distracts him from the black... Poor ones from the wilderness. - There you are with your nonsense... Pass me the plate. Eat plenty, I don't want anymore. They are dangerous women, I don't know what they have. The boss was there. It's a spell... It's a spell... Spells she uses! Oh what a talk... To have in front of the mother, The daughters... - Shut up and eat. You never learn. Don't forget the pills. It's unpalatable. - She never does it as I say. We should fire her. Out, out! They are a plague, so shameless! No one would miss them. The better we pay them, the worse they work. Out, out! They are filth. - Oh nanny... I don't see the joke. I don't want fights at the table. At least today let me eat calmly. We save by one side, they spend by another. Can't have money like this. I can't eat this. Stop with the oddities. Saved from gluttony, that's what it is. But look, it tastes fine to me. Maybe it's because we are celebrating. Well, celebrating... I don't have the age to that. And for a little treat? - Those he always has age. I must be sick. I can't eat this. - You have been with a lack of appetite. So many preoccupations... One day you will end bad with those jokes, you know? Don't you want to go to window, see whose outside? And you, you should behave. Looks impossible... You don't even respect this day. I want a little more... You can't eat more, it isn't good for you. Poor thing, not even today that we are celebrating? When do you take me outside? Let's go for a little walk... You can take it. At the shadow of the routine, and the boredom. That the sweet life of family generates, we will be an exemplary couple. Children we will have those who we'll teach the good Portuguese. Chain and medium, what came of wrong, awaits them. To be always innocent, oh, I wanted it so bad. Milk-teeth, a little wire of voice. Of the past, the lesson is good practice. Because, those who are similar to theirs... doesn't degenerate. And see, what humbleness, has its award. They obey, we in charge. I'm married! I'll have children, 9 months from now... I am... The mother! My womb grows! All my body leaves the shadow. This house exists to wrap me. Today I am more important than yesterday. Today... I have a son to educate. Know by heart the screams I'll give. The father's terror seeing this victory. I feel the chain of milk empty my son.. So... I also demand being a part of history! I rocked the cradle. For the first time, I spelled the names. The diseases without medicine. Shred the third. And at night, to make them sleep, transmitted them what I was taught centuries ago. But I tremble with the revolutions and the storms. With a lot of wind and light. Everything I do, running and thinking, two times, more. I know there are dangers. But it's dangerous to name then. I know there are addictions, but why should I speak of that? So I save this half innocence. The rent and the knitting. The patience... I let it jump? Yes father, yes! Careful with the chandelier, it's better you not, don't! It can hit a wall and damage it, it can break a glass... It's better not, it's better not. And half is spilled. No champagne, makes the head dizzy. I'll get something even better. Also bring a glass, so you can drink champagne with us! So you go to sleep happier. If this is champagne... Go on or you'll lose your strength! Thank you so much and congratulations. Thank you. No speeches, no speeches! Let's drink! That this day happens for many years. - This is tea with sugar. Happy birthday to you, in this lovely date, many good fortunes, plenty years of life! Portuguese people! You know what you want? Yes! Portuguese people! Know were you are heading? Yes! "A Mocidade Portugesa" plays. "A Mocidade Portugesa" plays. "A Mocidade Portugesa" plays Salazar! We owe you hope! We owe you peace! We owe you the present! But from today, the debt turned bigger. We owe you certainty. We owe you the happiness. We owe you the future. In the name of all of us, in the name of everyone who is to come, following us, stronger and healthier! Praise you, Salazar! For keeping your promise. Thank you for all the centuries to come. Thank you forever! Praise Salazar! - Hurray! On those times, my house was an island. You would still see fields from the balcony, and the silence would only be broken in the winter, with the noise of rain against the windows. And in the summer, with the noise of the electric cars in the rails. We had little money, but grandmother would send stuff from the farm. And we didn't need sacrifices for managing the house. With our first daughter the troubles came. She ended up in and intern school. And by that time, my father got sick. Was a year, before he died, in the greatest physical misery. We didn't want her to see him in that state. We had him locked in the room. When she came from vacations, she only say the coffin. Went to be buried on the day the war ended. But the room remained closed, with bags and old furniture. And we only opened it when grandmother stopped being capable of managing the farm. And came to live in the city. Never got used to this life. So, absence that transforms in resentment when we say anything to her. Don't do this. Don't touch that. But her life is now another. Mister President of the Council. The Portuguese Nation here represented in every it's activities and organisms. Comes to claim today. Its profound gratitude. Because you could predict the calamities that threatened the world and to prepare and strengthen the country to beat them! Because arrived the hard times. You defended in the middle of so many contradictions and dangers. With the help of providence the honor and integrity of the nation! Hurray! Mister President of the Council, you can trust the Portuguese people like it knows that it can profoundly count on you! My lady, a poor man is here, asking for something you could give her. Have patience, today I can't. It can't be every day, every hour, every moment. Have patience. They don't leave us alone. One penny today. Two tomorrow. If we pay attention, at the end of the month. It's a wage. The problem with it is maybe the most distressing for being more theatrical. Because it makes the foreign think and even the nationals! That behind that misery that sports makes difficult the transit in the city, there is a misery that hides itself. But that keeps spreading. And although, that's a wrong thought. That isn't the index of misery, because it's more of an addiction. Because the majority of those who ask, don't need to ask. Maybe when it's a blind... a crippled... We see, we know it's true, we aren't being fooled. Even so there are those who disguise, that pretend. You would never know... This case however, doesn't have the seriousness that is assigned. Save your you exploitable theatricality. And it can be solved if there is good will. By the following method, first: Severely punishing false beggars. Going like that, door to door, disturbing each one. You never know, it could be a thief. I'm sick of you telling you not to open the door. Second: Returning to precedence. Your homeland, the poor that aren't form Lisbon. And third: putting the rest, the real ones, in the exiles created for that. But they prefer vagrancy, alms. Some have more money than you, or than me. What they don't like is working. And without work, you have nothing, accomplish nothing. Isn't it? You ever saw someone have something without working? The living room needs waxing. Those curtains are black. And the carpet, how long has it not been beat? X I'm going out, I'll be back for dinner. Don't be late for dinner. In this house in we never eat at the right hours... This toilet leaves a smell... Don't forget, today you should scrub the staircase. Advices for the domestic staff. Advices for the domestic staff. Don't talk to me about the worker that works self-consciously on his task. That spends his life complaining about ironing. That think it is menial. It's a foolish creature. And rather unhappy. Only to her the job becomes unbearable. Only to her the day seems eternal. And the week infinite. So, to iron the apron doesn't require any science. Come one comes in the absence of the Lord, don't overcharge the memory with names. Because in truth, you have much more to do. Moreover, who can memorize every name there is? For sure you would confuse them. Even more, can't read or write. Can't hear anything with this noise, then it's me who gets deaf! Maria! Only appear after they have been called three or four times, Because only dogs go after the first whistle. - Maria! And when the mister yells: "Who is there?" None of the servants is obligated to respond, because "who is there" is not a name for a person. If they wish to leave the house they work, and if they fear offending the boss because they are too timid for that subject, the best is to become from one day to the other, the most naughty possible. So they think of firing them. And leaving, give the worst information, so that no one dares to offer their services. You know and I know, shut up and I'll shut up too. Let me pass miss. I'm sad with no adventure, luminous and precious servant. That endures the family dictatorship. Well put and virtuous. Spent my life serving. And more years I'll spend in other's home. When I leave from here, if I leave... I'll be sick of enduring. And old, ugly. Alone I am, I'm quiet. Among 5 people superior in money. And in facade. It's a bad habit for a servant not listening to the lords... Working so hard and well, would deserve some distraction at night. But like me there is no one, that is demanded, night and day, to be at hand. Oh what a hell of a life this of mine... How can I seem hollow? Alone in the kitchen, straightening. And ironing the clothes... It's about time to take a day off and to make it understood the authority of demanding and overcoming and advancing, and abolishing the property where it exists! What do you have in your house if I get fired? If all this goes to ashes... Goodbye home. But I don't want it for nothing... For the work you have done, some other life you deserve. People who don't respect and cast out, fires you quickly. There is no gain in working. Those who are in charge and do nothing, are bosses. I am no one. (A Maria = nobody) Don't laugh. That stuff doesn't bring money... I'll pretend to lose. Another day I'll win, and you'll win. Because it was from you I learned, everything I told you before. The concept of nation, is inseparable, on the Portuguese matter, of the notion of civilizing motion. Dealing with groups of people, of different races, languages and cults, this unique economic involvement. Nationalizing action can't loosen up of the effort from the hand of the populations, taking advantage of the helpful elements of cultures that found in its path, attenuating the tribal exhibitionism and rivalries. Making everyone participate in the common work. Waking the national conscience. X X. Someone to burn this hut! It's him captain. -Are you sure? Positive. Didn't you hear me calling you? - I did. Why didn't you answer? - I didn't felt like it. You didn't feel like it? It will soon. Tie his hands behind the back! Two whites no, two blacks! What does he say? - Are you the chief? Yes I am. I should slit your throat! - Quiet, sit down! Where? -The ground. It's dirty. Sit down! Only a feeling, is at the same time big and profound, to flood the soul in this moment. The firm determination of defending the national integrity. And it's this determination that has to be interpreted everywhere, as a valuable and striking affirmation, of our people's will to live. I explained some days ago, the obligation of deserving our dead. But seeing the spectacle, that God made us watch, of a united and eternal people, that compresses it with it's a thousand representations, near the place of power, before this standstill of souls, that totally offer themselves, to hear the echo of the same anxieties of the beyond-the-sea wars. That are now also enjoying this moment of peace. And by the legitimacy of their national participation before all this, that is beautiful, and big, and unique! You don't have only to deserve the dead, we have to try to be the best. Oh! I forgot the umbrella... - True! Maybe it'll rain and we forgot the umbrella. Do you need anything else? We were going there but we won't take too long. I need to be obeyed in my home. I think the father doesn't have much to complain from me. I have a clear conscience. I think I have been an obedient daughter. - Don't say anything! I don't want to see my home transformed in an ash of butts. Butts... or having faith be a follower. My faith is keeping me going. Reading of the book of Leviticus. In those days the Lord said to Moses: You shall talk to the children of Israel and you'll say: If you walk in precepts, if you keep my commandments, and if you practice them, I'll give you the rain. And the earth will germinate, and the trees be full of fruits. I will remove savage beasts from the land, and the sword won't enter your territory. Your enemies will fall by your sword. You'll eat the older fruit among the ancient. And when the new ones arrive, I'll put the old aside. I'll walk among you, I'll be your God, and you will be my people. Says the omnipotent Lord. If they fulfilled these principles... It's always the same thing... Never respects the other's opinion. I don't want to see my wife and daughter messing with priests. My gosh, saint Jesus! - Don't challenge me! Always the same thing! I always fought against that cancer of the society and I'll keep fighting till I die. God may have mercy on your soul. If the government concedes privileges to that scum, don't count with me. We were going to the mass for... - Died as a hero! Fulfilled his duty as a soldier! Wait a moment. His duty as a soldier! Died with a clear conscience or died in the name of others? X. The mass doesn't help. It's all to discount from our sins. Sins? What sins? Have judgment! This house... It's a house of mad people, an asylum! I believe that every man is born with the same duties and rights. I believe that for the woman, the same thing applies. I defend the freedom of speech! The several creeds that redeem the man. And the share made by the people, of those that have everything to those that eat nothing. I am worthy citizen... and aware. A Portuguese of birth. Democratic root. Today, with the experience life gave me, I know what it can be put to practice, or not. Everyone working is a duty. But... there are works and works for each one to do! The superior spirit, clairvoyant, cult is not a mule! Strong figure... Everyone working is a duty. But I won't bake breads for my baker to read. A soldier doesn't sit in a coffee shop, neither me, a pacifist man, goes to war! Oh no one is a democrat in his land. That man and woman be equal, there can be no more law adjustments. But I live among four, except the tureen that doesn't count, I am the one in charge. If I didn't impose and indisposed, if I didn't claim and cried out, If I didn't undo what they weave, and I didn't have them under my wing, what would be of me and them? Oh no one is a democrat in his home. Miss? Miss? Miss? Hey, miss! A dead body! Oh what did this girl do... What she thought! I had a feeling! Miss, wake up! Look the father! Go, go! - Oh girl, what happened? Take it out! Take it out! Oh my god, what did she do? This isn't something normal to do! Take it out! Do something instead of looking to each other! For what are women worth? It's better to call for a doctor. What a shame, what a shame. She needed some slaps! She has the age to start behaving. Is this the example you give to your sister? Linden tea, linden tea for the nerves! Is this what your praises are for? How will you tell this feat to the superior?! Don't massacre her more, get out of here go inside, she will be okay if God wants. - My poor thing... Why did try to kill yourself, did you have any reason? I don't know, I believe so. Woke up with that idea so I put it practice. Can you explain better? I don't think I can explain better. It was a moment of weakness. Wasn't it hard? - No. Never had an idea seem so simple. To put to practice. Maybe I had a dream. I usually dream a lot but I wake up more tired then when I went to sleep. Not this time, I was full of strength. Did you want to celebrate that? Yes. I believe it was a celebration. Posthumous. And now, how do you feel? Well. All back to normal. Life doesn't seem to be more than this. Thank you Lord that you spared me. Good she didn't notice. Slide the window Maria. The statue that since today is a part of this palace, doesn't try to be a consecration. It wouldn't be enough for that. And there is no monument that can rival, what Salazar raised with his own hands, by restoring, rebuilding and redeem this country. The 30 years of government that we celebrate today, Stand out and individualize themselves in the history of Portugal for being the era of Salazar. The 30 years of his government, have been profound transformation, wide in the field of things, by a miracle of action. But they weren't of a lesser projection in the field of ideas, of habits and costumes. And that by the work of permanent teachings, by the word and by example. It was created a new style of public living, a style of composure, dignity and moderation, and that is after all, the style of Salazar's own attitude. The Master among some disciplines that for 40 years helped him erecting the country over the biggest political crisis that the nation knew over it's long centuries of history. His word of honor was always clear, timely... They are sitting in the living room. He has his eyes fixes in the television and an old dream of power and strength passes through his aged head. The room is dark. She listens do the noise of cars in the street. Echoing by the thick walls and the closed windows. Remembers of the purchases she has to do, the money that is scarce. The servant who she just argued with. To keep a habit of confrontation that confirms her in the place of Lady and owner of the house. He stands, looks through the window, closes the blinders and sits again, silently. Voices are heard from the stairs. Water in the pipes. A door closing. She is the mother, he is the father. Every night they sit in that room, one in front of the other, without looking at each other. Sometimes they talk of a luminous era, but only the walls hear what they say. And it will be lost with their death. To the soul haunted by doubt and negativism of the century, We searched to bring back comfort of the great facts. We don't argue God and the virtue. We don't argue the nation and it's history. We don't argue authority and it's prestige. We don't argue family and it's morals. We don't argue the glory of work and it's duty. These were the last images captured of Professor Oliveira Salazar by our cameras. They did it. I fought for the rights of my children. So... I leave them an honored name. But... I never got the trust of mine. I wanted to be firm, I was hard. Today... maybe I won't be more to my daughter eyes of a tyrant. Follow my advice, follow my examples, what you seem innocent, can seem to me a crime. What for you is without consequence, can be my coffin lid. The inequality, the injustice, you think it was you who found that? The absolute freedom never exists. Life is being contented with the possible. Sacrificed... Knowing to wait. I worked. I have done my duty with peace with myself. Was there something you didn't have? However, it seems you accuse me with your silence. You look at me like an enemy. Just as they leave infancy they start to help me. With what right? Paternity is a career that a fine day we get imposed with. Without wanting to know if we have vocation for it. Throwing all down is what you want. You are still a child. You don't know what you do... or what you say. I lose my strength... Joy, and even hope. I fought so much so that you had everything. And here I am. Weak, impotent, reduced to simple substance. Sad is the victory, that a child has over his father's reason. Instead of being happy, he should cry. Because that victory will cost him in the future. It was all for your own good. Parents... only want their children's good. Don't forget this. I am not excusing myself... I am not excusing myself... I am not excusing myself... Being radical is picking things by their roots. I restart. Start from the beginning. The.. his.. to.. Ry.. Of.. any.. So.. cie.. e.. Ty.. Was.. since.. always..

Built by the society's ruins, Our era is the era of bourgeoisie... The history of any society was always the battle of the classes. The history of any society was always the battle of the classes.
