Come on up. How are you? -Fine -That's good. Are you ready? Almost. I'll be back in a couple of minutes. Make yourself at home! OK Hey, did you tell Pablo about this weekend? Why would I? I don't know... You're so annoying! It was just a joke! When were you gonna to tell me about this? Today. Congratulations! When are you leaving? I'm supposed to leave in June, but there's a lot of paperwork to do first. As you can see, I'll be there for about 2 years. That's a long time! Have you told your parents? No, I haven't told anyone yet. Why not? Are you really sure that you wanna go? Yeah, of course. I've just got so many things going on in my head right now. I need to take my time. Is it because of your parents? Cut it out, Ana! You know how they are. They're old! It'll be hard for them. They won't understand. So, why did you apply for the scholarship in the first place? Sorry. I know this is my problem. You'll have to tell them sooner or later. Well, I'd prefer to tell them when I get back. I will have more time to think in peace. Why are you so complicated? I wonder when you'll stop straining every nerve to make a decision! Someday I will... I hope you'll be by my side that day. OK, we'd better get going! How are you, Susana?. -Have you been waiting long? -No, not really. -So, are we ready to go? -Yeah! -Good! -OK, let's go! Why is he here? Well, he gets on well with Leonor, so he wanted to come. Hi. Well, I hope no one's annoyed about me being here. -Hello. -We haven't seen each other in ages... Yeah, I think that last time we saw each other was at Fran's birthday. -I'm not making you uncomfortable, am I? -No. Let me put your bag here. Thanks. Ana, why are you so quiet? -Who? Me? -Yeah, you. Nothing. I'm fine. I'm just enjoying the view. We can't go this way. You have to go back to the main road and then go straight ahead. Are you sure? Yeah, I've done this a thousand times on my way to see Leonor. -Francisca, please, concentrate. -Hey, I never said to make a detour! Stop! We don't need to see you two arguing. You're siblings, for god's sake. Felipe, do as Fran says. Go back. At this speed... -It's OK. -Could you just let me drive, guys? I'm not gonna drive too fast on this road, OK? OK. Watch out! What's up? There's something on the road... What the hell, guys! It's a fucking dog! Disgusting! -What can we do? -Try not to run it over. A little bit further, just a little bit more... Watch your heads, guys. Have we stopped? It's stopped working! Has the engine flooded? I think so. Maybe there's too much dust in it. Don't worry, Felipe. There is not much more I can do to help you with this. Don't you have any idea about cars? Call me if you need a hand. It seems kind of complicated. What? I don't know. Are you OK? Yep, I'm fine. I've got a lot of work to do, which I would say is good. What about you? Fine. It's been a hard year, but I'm happy. Why are you happy? Do you remember my scholarship application? -Ah, to study in Berlin? -Yeah. Did you apply again? Yeah, and I got it! -No way! -Yep! Hopefully I'll be there in a couple of months... That's so great, Ana! Congratulations! -Thank You! -I'm really happy for you. What about your boyfriend? He still doesn't know about the scholarship. But are you guys still together? Yeah... I mean, we're working on it. -Working on it? -I'm still processing the news. -This is taking too much time! -What do you think they're talking about? Why didn't you tell me that he was coming, too? Don't blame me! It was his idea not to tell anybody. I thought she would take this badly, but... she seems to be okay. Who cares now? He's going to France. When? Very soon. -That's funny. -What? What? OK, but please don't repeat what I'm going to tell you. Is she pregnant? -No! -Then what? -She got the scholarship! -Wow, that's so cool! Yeah. Well, it seems that we are going to be neighbours. What do you mean? In 4 months I'm going to be living in a city just south of Paris. I'll be doing research work in an Institute. So, I'm happy too. There will be a lot of things to learn, and I'll be paid good money. So lots of things going on in my mind right now. You always wanted this opportunity. Yeah, I know, but I think it'll be strange to leave everything behind and move to somewhere so far away. This will make you laugh but... Honestly... What? Alfredo, can you help me? We'll talk later. Excuse me, sir. Hello... Hi. Our car broke down. Could you help us fix it, please? I thought it was the radiator, but it could be an electrical failure. We don't know much about cars. Bring me a cloth. -Hey, he's gonna help us. -Who's that man? That's great. Some local. He's sexy! Do you really think so? You've been single for too long. You may have a point. Turn it on. You really fixed it that quickly? Well, don't you wanna get going? Wow. Thank you! You saved our weekend. What are you doing? Here take this. No, I don't want money. -Please, accept this. -I said I don't want your money. So, on behalf of all of us I wanna thank you for your help.. What the fuck! Why don't you just shut up? Easy there! Are you OK? Why don't you shut up? It's just a burn, sir. It's gonna be OK. Just let your hand get some air. OK, you'd better get moving. Yeah, thanks. Here. Excuse me. Do you know where the Castaneda's farm is? Yes, it's not far from here. How far exactly? About 10 minutes away. Thanks a lot, Mr...? Juan Ferreira. Thanks, Juan. Be careful, young lady. This is a very solitary road. Thank you. Hello. Was it insulting that I offered him money for his help? Hey, man. I had to bite my tongue! I wanted to kick the crap out of him. Stop! There's something on the road. No, no. I'm not stopping again. But there's something on the road! Stop, stop! Open the door. -Stay here. -No, we're coming with you. Slowly. -Oh my god, what happened to her? -What is this? Don't just stand there. Do something. -We need to get out of here! -Ana... Ana... Calm down. Calm down. We have to get her out of here, Alfredo. Now. Please! I don't know if it is appropriate to move someone in her condition. -Hey, are you all stupid or what? -Calm down. -Can we think a bit before doing anything? -Think about what? What do you mean? Hey! You never help! Where are you going? She's in shock. Hi, good afternoon. My friends and I were passing by and we found a woman who... Motherfucker! What are you doing, assholes? Run! run! -Get up! -Come on, Susana! I'd like you to meet someone. Come on. I can't anymore... We should have gotten you help immediately. Sorry. If you stay here. They'll kill me. What? She has to eat. Take her away! This is for you... so that you can look pretty. Pretty? Who's there? What are you doing? Pedro! Come. Go to your room! There was no need for that. Take care of this. I did nothing, man. So you're not a man all of a sudden? Where are my friends? What do you want? Let me out. What are you gonna do to us? What good would knowing do? Please! Please! Let me out of here. You will be handed over. To whom? Does it matter? To the "Power." The people that paid for you. So be grateful for being here. Once you get to that hellhole you'll beg to return this house. What are you doing, idiot? What are you doing? You can't do this. They don't belong to us. You know that! Never do this again! Did you hear me? Never again! Out. She can't move. Out. Now! Sit down! Are you OK? Yes. How are you? Felipe? What do you want? There are things... Shut up! There are things we don't speak about at the table. Where are my friends? And? -How did the little girl sleep last night? -Don't touch her! -Take your hands off me! -Calm down, calm down... Have you forgotten what you said to me? You said that if I played with you then you'd let me go. What does she mean? Ah. Didn't he tell you? -She's lying! -No, I'm not! Didn't you tell them that we're going away together? What? What did you say to her? He said that if I paid attention to him then we'd run away together. She's lying! I never said that to this bitch! No? What the fuck did you say? Catch her! -Get off me! Let me go! -Get back inside! Don't say anything... How are you? I'm fine. I've got a lot of work to do, like always... What about you, young lady? What are you doing here? Let's get to work. Are you OK? Of course she's OK! Get the order out of the car. Put the boxes here. And where are your friends, young lady? Inside. Hurry up, Juan. -Where are the other boxes? -OK, OK... Let me go get the money! OK! It's 40 dollars, like always. -Come on. -No, no... -Come on, please... -You go. What's going on? Help me. I warned you... I told you this place could be dangerous... Get us out of here! Are your friends okay? Get in the car and hide! Ana. Your friends are waiting for you! Let's go inside to get the money. No, I can't. I'm too busy. I have to deliver some orders. Go and get the money. I don't have time for this. OK, I'll come in for just 2 minutes. How long have you been delivering orders to us Juan? For about 30 years. Did you know my mother? Yes. She must have loved you a lot. It seems that way. So... So what? I don't know. You tell me. Hey, Carmen. Let her go. Why? 'Cause she's different. She's not like the others. Like the one inside your car? Well, I have to go... Without your money? Thanks. Don't move, asshole! Stay there! What's going on, guys? Is this what you want, Juan? Open the door! Is this what you want? Open the door, fat ass! Give me back the girl. Give her to me and go away! You're almost like family, Juan! But not quite! You poor maniacs! Did you call us insane? Come outside. No! Come on, come on. What does this all mean? Your new life starts now, Ana. -What did you say? -Take this. Don't do anything stupid. What is this? That? It has a bullet inside. Shoot! I can't. I'm not a murderer. You have one minute! If you don't do it all of you will die. I won't do it. Who is it? Does it matter? If you do this you can save all your friends. Kill me. It seems you don't understand! Do what I say! No, Ana. What? You've got 20 seconds. No, no... Time is running out, Ana... Don't do it! I want to live! My life can't end here. -Do it! Kill him! -No, please! Well done. Show them who it is. It was him or you, Ana. Take her away. Gather them all. We have to deliver the group. Hey, hey. Chelita. Listen to me. One day you'll eventually understand everything. If you had never been delivered to me, those jerks would have killed you or kept you locked up like a dog in some underground room in this house. Fran, Fran, try to react. I know how you feel. We all feel bad about Felipe, but if we don't try to escape nobody will ever know what happened to us! -Fran... Fran! -Stop! Leave her alone! We have to get out together! I can't do it alone! It's impossible! Do you see what kind of people they are! I'm not waiting here for those motherfuckers to kill us! We can't get out, Alfredo! There are three of them and one of them is a woman. I can deal with the men, but I need you guys as well. I need both of you! Fran. Why? Why? Why? Go, go, go! Just leave! Go! No, no! Forgive me. -Come on, motherfuckers! -No, no... Move! Move, bitch! Run! This way! Follow me! Find all of them! Where are the others? I don't know! Come on! Let's get out of here! One of the bitches is still inside! Run! Run! Hello. Sorry. We've just escaped from a house, we need help. There are some guys chasing us. We're in danger. Please, get us out of here! What's going on? It's too long to explain. Please get us out of here! -OK, OK. Get in the back. Quick! -Thank you! Good afternoon. Hi. Good afternoon. Have you see a couple pass by? Yes. Just a minute ago I saw two people running over there. They tried to make me stop the car, but I didn't. -They went back down the road. -Yes. -Back down the road? -Yes. -Did you get a clear look at them? -No. OK but you saw that they were going back down the road? I already told you! They went back down the road! -Don't cause any problems, girl. -Well, if you don't wanna help... -No! no! Don't move. Don't move! -No! No! Don't touch her! Angelica! Angelica! Put the gun down or I'll kill him! Or what, motherfucker? I will kill him. Put it down! Throw it away! Step back. Back! Are you going without the girl? Let her go. Are you gonna leave her with me? -We can't... -Sorry... So what are you gonna do without your Daddy, little girl. Can I be your dad? Touch me, little girl. Touch me! Touch me! Run! See you back at the house! Hi! Sorry. We need your help. There are some guys following us. They've killed a whole family. We don't know where to go. Ana, run! I'm scared. Calm down. No! Go, Ana! Go! Enough! Go inside. Why? After all we've done for you! Die! -Help me! -What's going on? -There's someone following me! -Who? He's here! What? Already? Jorge, leave. Why? You're not supposed to know about this. How long have we been doing this? It won't gonna happen again. We now have a massacre in the community. And it is our duty to clean it up. We didn't want this. But we caught them all again, Mr. Gustavo. Who is this man? He's our cousin Jorge, Sir. Who dares to speak without my permission? He helped us bring them back here... He's Esther's son. Really? What do you want? I wanna work with you. First of all you have to trust us. OK. Open your mouth. Do you still trust me, Jorge? Now show me what you have prepared for me. And clean this mess up. This is all your fault, Ana. Francisca! We need to stick together to get out of here! It's always the same with you... Always playing the victim. Fucking dumb bitch! You are unscathed! Your body has not been violated by these animals. What are you going to do with us? You've been rescued. No, no! Don't touch me! And you will be released. Please... For you! For us! At sunrise... it will be your turn, my friend. And you ladies will stay here to increase the population of our humble town. From darkness to light. My Lord, please welcome them to your kingdom. And wipe away their sins for the whole of eternity. It's all my fault... No, don't say that. We should have never stopped. This is not your fault, Ana. Calm down... We can't make any mistakes this time. I need to get out here even if they kill me for trying to escape. You heard what the old man said. This will become our own hell. Who are you? Why are you here? Is your father the fat man who you were with? We know where he is. If you help us, we can take you to him. We can tell you how to find him. Hey, sweetheart. Trust us. There's a big key. Over there. Yes. You have to come with us. If at any moment if I can't go on or if they catch me, promise me you'll continue. Promise me! I promise... but I don't understand why you're asking me to do this. Because I know you well, Ana. I know that you always keep your promises. Hurry up! Come on! Come on ! What are you doing? I can't go any further, Ana. I will to try to slow them down as much as I can. -You have to go and get help! -No! Ana, you promised me! -No... -Yes... yes. Go! -Why are you doing this? -I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ana. Ana, come on! Come on! Let's go! I want them here before sunrise... -They're gonna catch us again! -I can't go on anymore. I can't... Be quiet, please, or they will catch us. I'm so sorry. We have to keep on going. Come on, Fran. Come on! Where's the girl? Be careful. Come on! Now that's what I like to see! You didn't have to do that, jerk. What a mess... Do you understand that if they escape this will all be over? That won't happen. Keep on walking. I said keep on walking! -What happened? -My foot! It's broken! I have to go on! -No, no! Don't leave me! Please! -Stay here, I'll come back! No! Don't leave me! Please don't leave me alone! Ana! Please! Ana! Ana! Ana! Help me! Calm down. Breathe. Everything's OK. Stay here. -Don't go! Don't go, please! -I will come back. Let me go for help! Please, stay here! I'll come back. Don't leave! Please! Forgive me. Stay back or I'll kill you! You don't know who I am... Think about what would happen to you if you shot someone like me. Have you thought about the danger that you'd put your parents in? -Why, bitch? -Stop, Carmen! Stop! She can't leave! You can't touch her! This bitch can't leave this place! What are you doing, child? You do not want to understand, do you? You are making a mistake. Let her go! Put the weapon on the ground. Let her go! Surrender. I'm dying. Die, damn bitch! No! What have you done? You've made a terrible mistake! Kill me! You are already dead and buried. -What happened? -Help me! -OK. Calm down. Tell me what's going on? -Drive, please! -Get me out of here! -Alright. Let's go to hospital! -Calm down. It's all over. -We have to go now! Hurry up! OK! OK! But please calm down. Get me out of here now! Now! I can't anymore... I can't!
