[soft piano music] [soft female vocals over piano music] CENTER OF MY WORLD [birds chirping] That's me. A totally normal country boy. Maybe a little gayer than most. But still, quite standard. And this is what I do best. Just hanging around, chilling, listening to music or spending rainy afternoons in the library Or hanging around with Kat, my best friend. Stealing fruit and berries, making ice cream, and then obviously eating it. And that's my family. My mum, Glass, although to call her mum is quite a stretch. And my sis, Dianne. Dianne and I used to be like... Like MacGyver and his pocketknife, like asparagus and hollandaise sauce or, just like the Olsen twins she was my everything, my best friend, my ally. And I was her kindred spirit. and this is where we live. Inherited from a great aunt or something. It's called Visible. Hellooo, how weird is that? and them? They're our neighbors. And their houses. And their gardens. And their lives, which Glass wants to know nothing about [birds chirping] [car honking] Tereza? Hey Phil Glass wanted to come and pick you up but then decided she wanted to cook for you instead and now she's like... [laughs] you know what she's like come on, let's go Come on, don't make a big deal about it. How was camp? Think of it like... You have a cat allergy and they send you to play with a bunch of cats. That's kinda like how it is with me and French. You're such a drama queen. A drama queen, bien sûr. How are my two ladies, by the way? Every time I called Glass was... I dunno... Phil? What happened here? You didn't hear? It was a real shit storm, like no other. I've never seen anything like it before. Damn. Thanks again Say hi to Pascal for me bye [excited scream] [laughter] [kissing sounds] Sorry I didn't pick you up. It was just... Are you hungry? I actually wanted to make chicken, but then I ran out of time and then I... Mum, I really wasn't expecting that you learned how to cook in 3 weeks Watch your tongue, young man. Ah, no no... Just two. Dianne isn't here? No, she is... Come on, tell me about your thing... About your camp... Mum, it was amazing, please send me again next year That nice, huh? HEY, there you are! Hey Phil, let's talk later, yeah? I have to run. Welcome home. What's up with her? Nothing. Come on, let's eat. [door slams] Mom? Don't mom me, I'm warning you. What happened here? Did the Third World War pass through our garden? That was the storm, it wrecked everything. What happened to Dianne's tree? Glass? Mom? Glass? Mom!? Not now Phil. Later, darling, yeah? [door slams] Welcome home. When Glass first arrived, she was barely 17, I think, and already 9 months pregnant. And all of a sudden, there were three. [babies crying] Three kids in the middle of nowhere. It didn't go down so well around here. A woman with two kids and no husband, it didn't look good. But we got along really well, even without a man in the house. Other kids would often ask where our father was. And we'd ask Glass. She's always say something like: He's a seafaring adventurer Or something like: A cowboy on the ranch And later, when fairytales just didn't cut it anymore. I'll tell you when you're older, okay? At some point, we stopped asking, because it was useless. And now it's almost normal to know nothing about our father. The ominous number three on the list. Dianne doesn't even seem to care anymore. From my point of view, there's an emptiness, almost like a blind spot. [brushing] Hey, do you ever think about him? About who? You know who I'm talking about. Don't you miss him? Why should I? I don't know him. Don't you ever wish... I mean... Don't you ever think about how it would be if we knew him? [spitting] Come on, let's go Get it? Yeah. What about it? Duh! these are the names of her lovers. So look at the dates, and count back nine months. That must be him. It makes total sense. America. Somehow this word has always had a calming effect on me. As if it could fill this emptiness in me. [phone beep] You're back and you haven't called me yet? You Lulu! [laughs] This Lulu just got back from language camp. I can't wait to see you though, Madame. Hehe [electronic music] [phone beep] Don't hehe me, mister. I'm dying of boredom and I want to see you. NOW. [electronic music] Really Phil, I'm so glad you're back. These past three weeks have been horrible. Ok, hold on, you'll love this. What do you think? Nice Kay, you're right. It doesn't do my ass justice and my boobs look like two peas. What's crazy was that storm, you know? Right before we went on vacation, it was huge. It felt like the apocalypse was coming. They say there was a kid riding a bike who almost died after a branch hit him or something. Shit, and? Monsieur? What do you think? I'd say... A little less done up would also be okay. The wrapping shouldn't look better than the present Kat loves to be different. Actually, she'd like to be a little like my mum. She idolizes Glass as if she were a goddess, and adores everything in her that all others find disturbing Hey, have you spoken with Dianne lately? Nope and focus please, you're mine now! Oh my God, I'm so happy you're back! [music] [car honking] [car honking] Mum! Please. You're finally free when you have nothing to lose. [car honking] THERE'S NO "S" IN BITCH! Glass always did what she wanted. She didn't care what others thought about her. But the others didn't exactly like that. They found it predictable. Glass called it being organized. The three of us - we stick together. We're strong and we will fight back. We don't have to fit in anywhere. And always remember that. No one can tell us how we should live, no one. I think Dianne suffered from Glass' social ignorance more than I did. But back then, she was still hopeful. Oh. Hey. Come on. Hey there, I'm Kyle. [squealing, laughter] Will you stay with us forever? Parfait? Bien sûr, madame. I'm dying for it. Lemon or strawberry? Love fruit. Madame, I like you. Look at me. Quickly, look. You're finally getting a beard. I love it Monsieur. Gorgeous! It's a masterpiece, isn't it? That tickles. That really tickles. Your hair looks like cotton candy. Look at you! You're the one with the thick beard! Un, deux, trois. Okay, you have to make the cream. Wait. By the way, we're getting a new guy in our class. And? And nothing, just that. I flipped through my dad's documents and saw. It seems they used to live in the area and then moved out of the country for a while. Now they're back and he's supposed to be cute. You can't manipulate my thoughts. Okay, fine, you totally can. Maybe. Picture, now! Yeah, okay! [laughter] [somber music] Dianne? Dianne, do you want to chat? Morning. Hey Phil. Morning. Good morning. Hey, Dianne, where were you? What? Last night, where were you? I have no idea what you're talking about. Do you maybe wanna go to school together? I have to take care of something first My boobs grew like crazy over the summer! Feel 'em. 2 cup sizes or something! At least! Are you sure that neither one of you guys wasn't switched at birth? I mean, like honestly, what makes you two twins? Do you want my gum? No thanks. I can share. So ladies and gentlemen, say goodbye to the sweetness of wasting time. Katja? May I have your attention, please? My god. May I have your attention, please? [upbeat music] And!? What did I tell you? Hi, I'm Nicholas. Finally, I know your name. Phil? I'm going to have another baby. Do you want to feel it? It's going to take a while, it's still so small! Isn't that nice? It is, it is. Have you told Dianne yet? Yeah, this morning. And what did she say? I don't want to see tears when you drop it. [bottles rattling] Earth to Phil! I finally know your name Why did you wink at that guy? Cuz I saw you like him. Want a lemonade, darling? Yeah. Where's my globe? Which globe? My snow globe! I told you already, I left it in the car. Here, take it. [sexy music] Dianne, I have to tell you something. Dianne? Ew. You're really gross sometimes How so? Hey, I have something for you. Pick a hand. Right. Tadaa! Your own bow Is it for me? Yes, here. Now you can really go hunting. Have you heard of Diana, the Roman goddess? No She's the goddess of hunting. I'll make you an arrow and show you how to shoot it [crash] I just want to be alone, okay? It's the phone. Again... Phil? Leave me alone! Did I do something wrong? We can talk about it I could get rid of you, Kyle. I really could. No Yes, I could Yeah? Fuck it Yeah, well then, fuck it I'll always always always be by your side. I promise. Kyle, get out... [glass shattering] Get out! Good morning. Where's Kyle? Kyle won't be coming by anymore. He sends you his regards, but he's not the one for me. [slam] [click] [somber music] I don't get what you have against him. [camera phone clicking] Just because. He's a fake. I feel it. And you know I have a good instinct, when it comes to people. Why are you being so grumpy today? I'm not! I must be imagining things then. I got a bad review on eBay, okay? Ahaa, there's the culprit. Who does he think he is? Horny asshole. Besides, he collects stuff. Who, your eBay customer? No, Nicholas. Listen to me, Phil, something's not right with this guy. Come on, let's go. My God. Horny asshole. Besides, he collects stuff. Who, your eBay customer? No, Nicholas. Listen to me, Phil, something's... [bang in the distance] [squeaking] [crickets chirping] [click] Look at this carefully, ladies and gentlemen, and tell me... What do you see? When you don't understand something, it sometimes helps if you step back, to get the bigger picture. Yes, Katja? Did you have breakfast with a philosopher this morning? Thank you for your meaningful contribution, Katja. What do you see now? Distance provides clarity. When you distance yourselves you get a better understanding. Only then can you see everything clearly. [beep] Hey Phil. Hi. Where were you today? Where.. Where was I? Yeah, during training? At the track? You weren't there. Right. Yeah I was just hanging around there. Ah, well then. That kinda sucks. I missed seeing you there. Me? [upbeat music] Yeah, I missed you. And tomorrow? Tomorrow? Well, yeah. If you... if you want to hang around there tomorrow, then just wait for me until I finish my laps. Um... Okay. Okay. [dramatic music] Kat, come quick! I have to tell you something. Hey, Thomas just accused me of having an affair with you. With you! How ridiculous is that? And even if it were true, it's none of his business! I'm really so over it. Men are just so stupid Hello? Present company excluded! At least I'm sure that you'll be mine forever and ever. What did you want to tell me, darling? I forgot. Okay. Mom? Phil. Is everything okay? Yes, do you need something? It's just that, I think I have a date tomorrow and I can't fall asleep. Okay, come here, sit down. Are you sure everything's okay? I'm going to give you some advice, yeah? So that you can let me sleep in peace. Okay. What should I do? Do everything. But never ask him if he loves you. Why not? If he says no, then you'll wish you'd never asked. And if he says yes, you'll never know if it's just because you asked, and he wants to avoid an awkward scene. You'll be disappointed either way, so drop it. But he could also say yes and mean it, couldn't he? Just trust me on this one Phil, I've been through this before. Funny, mom. You're such a big help. If you have any more questions, then ask away. But not tonight, okay? Night night, darling. Goodnight, mom. It wasn't that easy for Glass either. I think she fought hard for a long time. And then she got tired of fighting. It was around the time when she went to the hospital. [crying] Mum? Glass. Mum. Mama. Quick, call an ambulance, please! Do it. DO IT! Phil? What happened? I called an ambulance. They're on their way. Good job, my darling. Where's your sister? Upstairs in Glass' room. She's cleaning up. Dianne? What's going on in there? Nor for children's eyes. It was a terrible sight to behold and Glass was sad for a very long time. And Dianne started to withdraw herself too. I wanted to be sad as well, but it somehow didn't seem to work. I didn't have any connection to the baby yet. I think that was the moment where things started to go downhill. And a small silver rift started nestling itself between us. Hey, can't you sleep? Come here. When you were a baby, I always touched your nose like this. It would make you so sleepy. Someone once told me that life is like a big house. With many many rooms. You don't want to live in every room, and that's why some doors are always closed. And sometimes, things happen in life that can't be immediately understood. They're just too big and powerful, and you feel too small to face them. And then you get anxious. Do you know what you have to do then? You have to stick that anxiety into one of those empty rooms. But it's very important that you never throw the keys to that door away. Do you understand what I'm saying? Come. Last one there's a rotten egg! So? What now? Should we go to the lake? I don't have my trunks with me and I still have to help Glass with a few things Can't help those who don't wanna be helped. [bike horn honks] Kiss Glass for me, yeah? [whimsical music] Hey, cool that you waited. Are you coming? [water spraying] [music] I'm so happy for you! In love, huh. Would you hate me if I asked, whether you can really talk about love, when you've only done it for the first time? Pascal. What good does it do him if everyone sugarcoats it? I've known him for weeks! Yeah, from looking at him, as far as I understand. That is, more from gazing. Exactly. And sometimes a look is all it takes, isn't it Pacal? Of course, you're right. And what did he say... You know... After? He didn't say anything. We got dressed Well then, there's nothing I can say, really. No 'see you tomorrow' or 'I'll call you' or something? Yeah, obviously that. He wants to get together, he just doesn't know where yet. Why don't you just hang in Visible? You and your lover? Because I don't want Dianne and Glass to find out just yet About your fling? Is it a secret? No, I don't want them to know we had sex, if you really wanna know. So you're that loud, huh. Ah, but you can use my shed, I'll give you the keys in case you want another wild night. Yes! [crunching] Phil? Could you be home early tonight? I'm cooking. Hallelujah, what are you planning? What should I have planned? We're having someone over and I'm going to cook, that's all. And who's the victim? Hey! You don't know him. His name's Mike and he's a carpenter, and I'd like to... I see, a carpenter. What needs fixing? Shut up! We've only met a few times... ...And now you're cooking for him? Are you freaking out? Don't be ridiculous. I just want... You'd like for everything to be perfect? But Glass, Michael's going to get the wrong impression. Bye bye, Phil. Get out of here! Get out of here. [birds chirping] Wait here. Tadaaa! Tell me something. What do you want to hear? I dunno. Something about yourself. I want to know everything. Okay, well, I like... Sleeping in, chilling, eating. I like running and spaghetti. Yeah... I don't know if it was a dream, but I think we've met before, a few years ago. Could it be? I was walking with my mother to the supermarket. I saw you standing in front of the door. I was carrying a few bottles and they fell out of my hands. Do you remember? No, I can't remember anything right now. Where were you? I asked you to be on time. Sorry! I was... Is he already here? Yes! Michael? My son. Son - Michael Hi, it's nice to finally meet you. I've already heard quite a few things about you. Hi! I'm Phil, nice to meet you too. The fish totally fell apart, so I made fish soup instead. It's definitely disgusting. [clears throat] Ok, who's gonna try it? You're right, Glass, it's really no good. [all laugh] I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry! Do you want bread? No no! Should we make a couple of pizzas instead? Yes! Yes yes! How was your date? Is he your boyfriend now? What? Glass told me, that you wanted to go meet a guy. I hope it doesn't bother you. What? That I'm gay? Or that Glass can't keep her mouth shut? I'm hoping for both. Nah, don't worry about it. And yeah, I might have a boyfriend. I... What exactly did Glass tell you? That she doesn't really know. Sorry, I didn't want to be indiscreet. Ah. No no, it's all good... It's just that I don't even know yet. Unfortunately. [crickets chirping] He shouldn't get his hopes up. What? He shouldn't bother so much. He'll get kicked out sooner or later. It's actually going quite well. Well yeah, it always starts out well. It's far too late for such things. Could be. Anyway, I'd still give it a go. Just give him a chance. Nothing is going to change. It's too late. Don't you get it? [crickets chirping] And? Questions? What are you doing? Did you manage to get anything out of her? Nope. And I really don't care either way. Hey, Phil. If it bothers you so much, then do something. Just ask her. Okay, then I can have it back, yeah? Glass? Yeah? Where is the center exactly? What do you mean? Like, the center. The center of the world. Where is it? You really know how to ask questions. The center of the world hmm. I think... I think it's different for everyone. It's where someone stands and what the important things are. Yeah? Can I meet your mother? Trust me, you don't want to do that. Why not? I hear she's pretty cool. Oh yeah? What've you heard? Nothing bad. Just that she's freer than most of the philistines around here. Have you told her about us? Yeah. Really? And.. Is she okay with it? Mhmm. Have you... Does anyone else know? About us? No one. And your friend? Kat? No. She'd be jealous, wouldn't she? Could be, why? Does it seem like it? I don't think she really likes me. Yeah, right. What was that? What? That... [nervous laugh] Could I meet her? Who? Your mum? I dunno. Hmmm. Well, you get your taste from me, for sure. Have fun boys. And not too wild. [laughs] May I introduce you? My mother. You never told me you live in a fairytale castle. Careful, it's um... I mean, when you look at the studies, I'm a total cliché. No father figure. Surrounded by dominant women. Are you in touch with your father? But it's all fine. I guess you could say that. After all, I'm not the first one who grew up without knowing his Father. There were for example: Romulus and Remus, raised by a wolf, and founders of Rome, if we go by the myth. Father? None! Or DaVinci, or Charlie Chaplin, Louis Armstrong, John Lennon, Mike Tyson, Truman Capote, Jack Nicholson, Gene Simmons, Eminem, Bill Clinton, Obama and not to forget Luke Skywalker. All of them grew up without a dad. And regardless, they became something. Well, maybe I shouldn't think about it too much. Why does this damn blind spot make me so insecure? How can you miss someone, whom you don't even know? Can I come and visit your place next? That'll be difficult. Difficult? Why? Because my dad is always traveling, and my mom drinks Prosecco like her life depends on it with her friends. So.. Difficult. Is it bad? Not really. It was just... Just... [grunts] Watch out, watch out. [sawing] Come on, lift it! That didn't work out. Does she ever talk to you about it? About what? Glass. Does she talk to you about Dianne? No. Honestly, I don't even want to ask. I feel like they have to work it out themselves. And you? What are you doing about it? [atmospheric music] [knocking] [splashing] Sorry, I'm almost done. Are you leaving? I'm meeting Kora for a bit I'll always always always be by your side. You should put make-up on more often. Ass. What's Kat saying now that you have a boyfriend? Did she tell you about it? No, she didn't, but I can tell. Have you forgotten? I am your sister, after all. Or doesn't she know yet? Yeah, I know. I have to tell her. Hey Dianne, I miss talking to you. Hey Phil, Vanilla ice cream! No I can't anymore! Yes you can! Vanilla is good for the soul. Says who? Says me! But I don't feel so good. Then you have to push through. Here, eat it. Mmmm. Hey, it's slowly becoming pathological, Monsieur. You need immediate attention. Do you really hate him that much? Well, hate... I just think it's ridiculous how everyone's making such a big fuss about him. You don't find him shitty though, do you? No no, I just think, that he... Kat, we're together. [laughs] You're kidding, right? No, really, I shit you not. Since when? I dunno. Not that long. I wanted to tell you, but I didn't know how to... I'm sorry, Madame. Really. Okay, wow. How's he in bed? Can't you ever ask normal questions? Who came on to who? Did you come on to him or did he come on to you? Do you want to get married? Do you want to have kids? Please do me a favor. Try to like him, okay? I'll keep my absolute, most beautiful smile just for him. [laughing] [birds and crickets chirping] [heavy breathing] [slow music] Because whenever you want, you can borrow my dad. He loves to annoy kids. Very funny. Hi. Hey. I know everything about you two. Every dirty detail. Meaning? Hush money. How much? Two thousand. In small, used bills? In large, new... Ice cream cones. Cherry and vanilla. Deal. [upbeat music] [splash] It was one of those hot, sky blue days, that tasted like vanilla ice cream and the future. One of those days that for whichever reason made your heart beat faster, and on which you would swear up and down that friendships would never end. Phil, you have to come quick. Dianne was arrested! Finally, hey Phil. What's going on? Where is she? I don't exactly know. They're both in there with the police right now. Who's 'they'? Dianne and Kora Kora's also here? Michael? Hi there. Where's Glass? She didn't want to come. What do you mean, she didn't want to come? Dianne was arrested and she's not here? And? What do we know? Nothing really. The police said something about a dog. It might have attacked a boy and hurt him pretty badly. What dog? The kid's dog. What now, so the kid was attacked by his own dog. What does Dianne have to do with it? The boy claims Dianne set the dog on him. That she was somehow controlling him. That's ridiculous. Where are they? There? To the right. I'll go talk to them. [knocking] Perhaps Michael's reaction would have less convincing, had he known Dianne longer. What Glass had already seen long ago, I only clearly realized that night. Dianne! Glass! What the hell? What are you doing up there? Nothing. Dianne. Stop this shit now! Come down here now! Did you you hear me? In a minute! No! Now! Bye. Bye. Kora, should I drop you off somewhere? That would be great if it's no trouble. No, no. Did you or didn't you? Did I what? Set the dog on the boy? Dianne? Don't play dumb. What are you trying to say, Glass? That you believe a bunch of strangers over me? Because I know you. If you knew me then you wouldn't ask these questions. [slams door] How am I supposed to know you when you act like this? Crazy? What's crazy about having friends that are interested in other things besides random guys and fucking? Where did I go wrong, Dianne? You really want me to answer that? YES! God damn it! YES! How much time have you got? I give up. Mum... Mum, you didn't try hard enough. Maybe if you... Shut up, Phil. You have no idea. No idea. So stop with the good advice. How do you do that? Make animals come to you? I'm not doing anything. So why are they coming? Because I listen to them. What are you up to? Phil, don't bother me. Did you do it? Did you set that dog on the kid? Phil, don't be such an idiot. Don't you think I would've held that dog back if I could do such shitty magic? Then just tell her! Then everything'll be okay again. Phil, it's not okay. Go away, please. What's going on with you, Dianne? Why can't we go back to the way things used to be? [door closes] Glass, I don't want to interfere, but maybe now would be the time to... Then don't interfere, Michael. This has nothing to do with you, so stay out of it! Glass, this is getting childish! Ah! Then get out! Nobody's forcing you to stay! Please leave! Maybe it's better this way. With this, you're arming yourself to the teeth. You're not getting rid of me that easy. [crying] And yes it does concern me, because I care about you all. What's this shit? Why are you following me? I wasn't. I'm not your... Okay, yeah, okay. Maybe a little. I just want to... You don't say anything. Maybe I have a reason? Go home, Phil. Diane? [music] [knocking] Good morning! How's it going, handsome? Breakfast? Are there also greens? Not yet, but look who I bought! Surprise! Hey, I saw that you guys have a shower in your garden. What's up, do you feel like it? What's wrong with you? You look like you got hit by a train or something. Okay, breakfast! Yeah, come!! Woo! [laughter] Right on my ass. No. Stop. Stop!! Hey, boys. I was thinking: I want to dye my hair. Black! Why not. Do it. Do you have any idea, how wonderful of a man you're going to be? You think? Everything at home sucks. And with you it's so great. I'm crazy about you. I feel sick when I'm not with you. I can't think about anything else. Is it good or bad? You don't always have to be so dramatic. I love you. [water running] What's wrong? Nothing, just leave me alone. Hey, I'm sorry. Well, maybe he just has nothing to talk about or to say. Ever though about that? Yeah, right. Everyone has something to talk about. Where's Tereza? She'll be home late today. Nice. Tea? That's okay. Are you two happy? You and Tereza? Sometimes very, sometimes not so much. But yeah, I think in general we're happy. I just don't know what he's really thinking. You know, what he feels. What do I mean to him? Why don't you just ask him? You're worried about what he'll say. Glass also says that it's better not to ask. And you think Glass is the right person to ask about this kind of thing? Oh hun, you're freaking me out. Sit down. Okay, what do you want from him? I don't know. More reassurance, I think. See? Now we're getting somewhere. The bad news is: there is no reassurance in relationships. Then at least I wish he wasn't so closed off. He knows everything about me, and I know nothing about him. I feel like I don't know him at all. and I love him anyway. Not anyway, in spite of! Maybe that's it? What fascinates you about him? The mysterious Prince. Very funny. Hun! It's a wonder that you managed, out of the millions of sperm, to make it, with that ambition of yours. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to grab life by the balls a little, and not just hang around. If you want answers, then do something about it! [music] Do your parents... You know... Have you told them about us? No. They wouldn't understand. Oh, okay. So. This is the garden. This is the lawn. My mother has it mowed at least once a week. God forbid someone walk by and see it unkept. And... This is the house. You coming? What's in there? Just things. Come on. Phil, it's really not important. You're hiding something. Come on, my parents aren't here. I'll show you around. Phil, it's nothing exciting. May I? What is that? Those are... Things I've collected. These are all things that people have lost or thrown out. Maybe others don't find them important. Or maybe they meant something to someone once and now they're missed. I believe that people don't just lose things by mistake. I mean, not on purpose, of course, you know? All of these things are a symbol of disregard. I built my own world in here. I gave these things a new life. And what do you do with them? Nothing. Well... I think about their history. [laughs] Sounds a bit psycho, right? That's why I don't tell anyone about them. I... I... Do you have a favorite? Why? Come on. [loud buzzing] Hey! [music] Hey! I made your chicken. I thought you'd like to have some. Thanks When are you coming back? Are you speaking with Dianne again? That doesn't concern you, Phil. Yeah but I live here too, so it does concern me. And it concerns Dianne too. It concerns all three of us. I'm not going to let you guys pressure me, Phil. Hey, come back here! You're being childish! I'll come back when you're back to normal. This atmosphere... I can't take it anymore. Phil. Phil! Phil! I'll talk to her. But you have to leave it to me, to be ready, okay? ♪ Beautiful world, where are you? ♪ ♪ Come back, lovely time of nature's bloom. ♪ ♪ Come back, lovely time of nature's bloom. ♪ Telephone. Again... Phil? Sorry, he's still sleeping. I'll let him know, yeah. Bye. [beep] I'm starting to run out of excuses. Don't you have anything to say to Kat? I so hoped that everything would go well. Maybe you should thinking about going back to Visible. Why to Visible? Because it's your home? Yeah, but I'm not going back there. Okay. How long are you going to hide for? No idea. Until the two of them make up. What if they need you to do that? They don't need me. They're so busy with their own problems that they don't even see me anymore. Do you remember what I told you about the house with all the rooms? That I can hide things in there. Exactly. What else? That you should never throw the keys away. Why? Because maybe one day you'll realize that the only way to get to the bigger, more beautiful part of the house is through that room. [music] Do you want to talk about it? Where's Dianne? Don't you first want to talk about... Her things weren't outside. Where is she? She moved out right after you did. Where? She didn't say. Glass. What happened? Phil. I don't think now's the time... Mum. Please. But it's so hard to understand. Then give it a shot. Just try. I'm here. I won't run away. Okay, fine. You know the albums, right? In the bookshelf. The big ones with the pressed flowers... This all happened so long ago. The page. What was on it? [dramatic music] [rustling] A long time ago, women used to make themselves more attractive to men using poison from the Belladonna plant. With poison? Hey! In small doses, poison from the Belladonna plant dilated your pupils and made your eyes bigger and more beautiful. And that made you more appealing? Sure, when you had nothing better to offer. And what they brought upon themselves with their attractiveness, they... Zick... eliminated with higher doses of the poison. What does that mean? [laughs] Come on, let's go. [laughs] Dianne! Hey. Glass said you moved out. Where are you living now? At Kora's. She's tutoring me in math. You know.. Sure. Tereza still has some space. Or if there's anything you need from home, I could bring it over. It's alright. It wasn't an accident, was it? It was planned. Why? Phil, it was a long time ago. Dianne, what happened? You already know. Glass kicked all of them out. With her actions and her style. And every time, we ended up alone again. At some point, I came to terms with it. And then Kyle came. He liked us and we liked him. And it sprang up again. The hope. That we... God, it sounds so... That we could maybe be a real family again. And then she distanced herself again. And I was so... So angry. All I wished for was another mother. And then I thought, if she could take our father away, then she didn't deserve another child. Mama almost died. And it was my fault. I shut myself off, and kept it a secret. Forever. Sometimes I can almost forget, but every time I see her digging in the garden, it all comes back. And when I left, you wanted to... No... I never wanted to tell her. I have to come to terms with it myself first, but... About a year ago, I met someone. Jan? How do you know about that? The letters. I found them in your room. But why didn't you talk about it? No idea, it was too fresh. It was something special, and fragile. Jan was good for me. He got me and could handle my anger. But then there was that storm in the summer. Everything started flying around. Tiles fell from rooftops and trees were uprooted and flung around like toothpicks. Jan was on his way to Visible. To me. But he never made it. Come with me. This is Jan. I come to see him almost everyday. I thought he would die without me. Crazy, right? God, Dianne. Come. Come on. I felt so guilty. I needed someone to catch me and hold me. She wasn't there. She was with busy with yet another guy. She started saying how she wanted another child. Everything came back to me. And I told her what happened. It's like I was 10 again and helpless. I screamed at her, told her I wished she had died that day. Oh, no. Oh, yes. Phil, you weren't there. Come home. And you? I'm there. I'm back. [bell buzzing] Hi. Phil? What's up? You're acting strange. I saw you. You and Kat. In your shed. How could you? I though that we were, somehow... Do you love her? Phil, I... No. Do you love me? How do you know that... That, that feeling you have for me... That it's love? I need you. Need? Like lungs need air or like you need the newest iPhone? That's not fair. Unfair? You're telling me what's unfair? Why does anything have to change? We have a good time together. Phil, I really really like you. Why can't we just keeping going like this. The three of us... It doesn't work like that. That won't work for me. It's not enough, don't you get it? Phil, I can't imagine my life without you. But I need Kat too. I need both of you. Nicholas, I can't share you. I just can't. I'm sorry. Phil. Phil! Phil! Um... If there's ever even the smallest chance, that you think about talking to me in the next hundred years. Phil, I just want you to know that I'll wait for you. I'll wait for your forever, if that's what it takes! [whizzing, exploding] [laughter] [cheering] Happy New Year! Cheers!! Open it! Open it! Open it! Ta da! [laughter] It's just a small survival kit for your trip. Who was it? No idea, nobody was there, but this was. [pop] [laughter] [music] You're starting without me? Baby To your trip! To your trip! To America! [cheering] I have a little something for you. I thought it would be more useful than that old map you have under your bed. Thanks! If you actually meet him, send me a picture, yeah? Who? Number 3! I thought you didn't care about that. Whatever, you shouldn't be so radical. It would be so great, if you came with me. One of us has to get their shit together. Besides, what can happen in three weeks? [sarcastic laugh] First, I'm going to rip up that list. It should've been done a long time ago. What? I did it already. As you said, it should've been done a long time ago. [knocking] Are you sleeping? I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight. I just wanted to say goodbye. Who knows if I can get up so early. Sit down, cruel mother. Excited? Me? Not at all! Listen up, Phil. I have an idea. You can ask me anything you want quickly. And I'll answer. Okay. What's his name? Next question Where does he live? Yeah right. This is starting out well. Okay, then - how was he? He was... He was wonderful. He was the most wonderful man that could have ever existed. If he was so amazing, then why did he leave you? He didn't. We loved each other incredibly much. He was so good-natured, so sensitive. When he touched a flower, it would start to bloom. I swear, I saw it. Butterflies, moths, all insects. He attracted them like a flame. Like Dianne. Like Dianne. But it has nothing to do with creepy crawlers at all. It was about this overwhelming empathy. This vulnerability. Haven't you seen what happens to these people? I was always afraid of him. And then? What happened? And then I got pregnant. Suddenly, I was afraid of you. And then it was clear. It would never work with him. Never. So I just took off. And I thought, yeah, once I'm gone. And...? I had no idea how bad my conscience would be, and how much it hurt. Why didn't you ever tell us? Because it was easier that way. What? Not to talk about it. Oh Phil, if only there was an easy answer for everything... I hope that you make all your dreams come true. But be careful, and don't expect too much. And don't be sad. Mom? Yeah? What's our father's name? [music] I thought we didn't do this anymore. Take care of yourself. Guys, I'm going to pee myself in a minute. Phil? [whispering] That's still me. And that's still my family. I'm really going to miss them. Everyday. Even Glass' cooking. For now, this is no longer the house I live in. And the small people, with their small lives don't matter anymore. It's all incredibly complicated here. But there's one thing I'm sure of: the center of my world is right here, where they are. Will I find him? I have no idea. And maybe he really is a seafaring adventurer, or a cowboy on a ranch, or a hippie or a transvestite or a loser, or maybe he sells weapons to desperate housewives. What do I know? The answer isn't important anymore. I can feel the emptiness in me getting smaller. But now I want to open a few doors. [music] [captioning: Ryan Suits]
