I got up and I looked outside, and there were two men on the telephone pole. And they were doing something on the wires, and there were lights shining on them. And it was really strange to see it at 3:00 a.m. So I freaked out, I went across the hall to my mom's room. And I woke her up, and I-- and I was like, "Mom, there are these two guys outside on the wire "and they're putting something-- "they're installing something at 3:00 a.m., and maybe we should call the police."

Was in... like, few months after your dad pass away. And someone came running, said that someone is here asking for you. I went to the door, I found already people inside my house by the door. Who? Two-- two-- it was like three-- three, I think. It was three men with the black suit. I recognize them, it was FBI, of course. You said they sat here for one hour. What did you talk about for one hour? You know, you don't know them. How they-- the same question, you don't answer, they will say another one, and they enter the oth-- the third one, the fou-- they make you-- they make you-- they make you confused.

How did you know the times where maybe you were just being paranoid and the times where really something wa-- No, excuse me, because everyone in the community was saying, "They came, they came, they came, they came." So if we wanna go and talk to some people... Mm-hmm. ...in the neighborhood who have stories, who should we go to? Many, honey. Maybe these neighbors. All of them, they received these people. So... Everyone has... Yeah, yeah. All right, here we go. My least favorite thing about journalism was... like, an MOS, "man on street," where you just have to like, find people and ask the-- like, I would dread doing that, and this feels a lot like that. Bridgeview is a really tight-knit neighborhood. Everybody knows everybody else. All of our dads are friends from the mosque, and all the moms are always looking out for each others' kids. ...so we decided we need to d-- No, she's not. Oh, okay. Well, we're doing a documentary about the neighborhood and all the surveillance that's happened here, asking people about things that they saw and things that they witnessed over the years, and so... A lot of people in my neighborhood have stories about being watched. But most of them are afraid to talk out loud about it, especially when there's a camera around. We got some bread. But no interview. Well, there are two cars in the driveway. Kinda feel like it's another way of saying "no." Come this way. If you can get an angle. A little bit more. Little bit more. Yeah, right there. And that damn car is always just parked right there. It's like how you see in the movies. Like those pizza vans that are just sitting, staked out in front of your house. When you pass the van by, like, they'd pull up... Newspaper.... a book or a magazine, or act like they're not in the car. Like, we can see you. They put a camera at the corner. So they watch all the area. I saw a car stop right next to garbage container, and they're going through it. Now I said to her, "Maybe they are homeless." But darn, homeless doesn't drive good Dodge van, no spot on it. ♪♪ First time we saw a car parked was the fall of 1990. Every time I went for the groceries, I saw the car. I went and drop off the kids, I saw the car. And we kind of thought that our house was bugged too, that somebody was looking into our house all the time. When my kids were small, you know, they said, "Oh, it was the bomb." You know? Like that was the really cool thing. That was like the big word, and we couldn't use it. And I had to tell my kids "no." Almost like a swear word, "you don't say that." You feel like someone's just invading your life, you know? I have a feeling that there is a camera, there is something watching. And you don't feel free, you don't feel safe. I don't remember how it felt to just know that I'm free in my home. "This is my home, it's just ours." I don't have that feeling. It's become to the point where I would call the neighbor across the street if a car's parked over there and you say, "Do you have a visitor that owns a car like that?"Mm-hmm. Isn't that terrible?

Our fathers were really close, and we spent our childhood going to picnics, listening to R&B, and riding our bikes after school. At the same time, Dee and Emma's dads were being investigated by the FBI. The government accused their fathers of supporting terrorist activity. In court, all of the terrorism charges were dismissed, but they were convicted of white-collar crimes. Emma's dad took a plea to lobbying without a license and spent five years under house arrest, and Dee's dad was convicted of mail fraud and spent four years in prison. After serving their time, they both continued to get visits from the FBI. Their families were regularly interrogated while traveling, and eventually tired of living with this constant harassment and fear. Both fathers moved out of the country and their families were split up. Stories like this were not uncommon in my neighborhood. And even though not a single person in my community has ever been convicted of anything related to terrorism, we still feel like we're being watched. My best friends' lives were turned inside out by what happened to them. And since then, I have lived in fear of the day we would be next. That they would come for me, for my family. I need to understand why the FBI was targeting my community, and try to figure out whether it's still happening today. ♪♪ Wrong way. There it is.

Do you have, you know, "this person bought something from this person who paid this person"? What do you-- what ties are there? What connections? Sure. I mean, for the most part, almost all of these investigations ended without any indictments. And the ones that did result in indictments were for things like tax fraud.Yeah.

The successful investigation, which was code-named Vulgar Betrayal-- V-U-L-G-A-R Betrayal, led to the June 1998 seizure of $1.4 million of Middle Eastern terrorist funding. ♪♪ That's the very first document in the whole series. July 11, 1996. All we know about why they opened this investigation is all here. It's about an organization called the North American Islamic Trust, which is an umbrella organization that has most mosques in this country under its umbrella. Uh, the weird thing about this is that-- so the ti-- this title here usually tells you what kind of crime they're looking for. And in the very first ones, it's all "white-collar crimes." Look, they have this "IT," international terrorism. So they-- they're looking for white-collar crimes but they're saying it's a terrorism investigation. So that's the first kind of question mark that comes up. And the list is here. And these are the major Muslim organizations in America today. So basically, they thought all of these mosques and charities were just one big front, cover for terrorism. I mean, what's the justification for this? This is the order saying, "In June of '98, "we're gonna seize the assets of an organization and a person." And one of the things they seized was the house I lived in, so that's what's whited out here. Our upstairs neighbor was the first American citizen ever designated a terrorist. And we were the neighbors living downstairs from him at the time. In a middle-class suburb of Chicago, living in this house, a man the U.S. government calls a designated global terrorist. His name, Muhammad Salah. "NBC News" caught him peering out the window this weekend. That guy peering out the window of his own house, that's Abu Ahmad. He's publicly known as the first American citizen ever put on the terrorist watch list. But I knew him best as Ahmed's dad, my bighearted upstairs neighbor. Abu Ahmad was a trusted man in our community. When there was a humanitarian crisis in Palestine in the '90s, our mosque sent him to the West Bank with thousands of dollars in donations. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank today, two American citizens of Palestinian descent are being held without charge in an Israeli military prison. While the government here describes the two Chicagoans as "agents" for the fundamentalist group Hamas, they have not been charged with a crime, nor have they been allowed to see an attorney. When he was arrested by the Israelis, accused of collecting money for terrorism, our community took to the streets to protest his arrest. While in Israeli detention, Abu Ahmad was tortured and forced to sign a confession in Hebrew, a language he didn't speak. The information collected by Israeli agents during interrogation was sent to FBI agents in Chicago and became one of the foundations for the Vulgar Betrayal investigation. Salah, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was convicted in Israel. But after five years in prison there, he was allowed to return to the U.S. despite protests from the lead FBI agent on the case who says Salah remains a threat. He and a number of others should've been arrested, should've been behind bars, should've had their citizenship stripped, should've been evicted from this country. Carrying his eight-year-old son on his shoulders, Muhammad Salah reacts to a not guilty verdict of aiding and funding a terrorist organization. I have to thank my community and the larger community. It didn't matter that Abu Ahmad was found not guilty in court. It didn't matter that the government eventually removed his name from the terrorist watch list. Once you're labeled a terrorist, that red paint never really comes off. Come on, Usama. It's really hard to get all of you together. The Gummy Worms will be here to lure you to the table. What's this? These are FBI documents. So I found 1,000 pages of declassified FBI documents... Mmm. ...about an investigation they were doing in Chicago in the '90s called Operation Vulgar Betrayal. Um, one of the most interesting documents, "Request for surveillance "to verify home addresses and employment. "The agent anticipates the interviews "of approximately 500 individuals and leaders "of many nonprofit organizations "throughout the United States. "Individuals who have invested, contributed, "and/or d-- donated money "to the North American Islamic Trust, "ISNA, IARA, MAS, or the Cultural Society will be interviewed." Literally any Muslim American who's involved in a community. Here's the list of the people that are gonna be interviewed. If there's an individual's name, it's whited out. There's our school.Straight up. Our school is at the top of the list. So the next document-- and this I'm gonna need Mama's help with. "On June 9, 1998, the assets of 'blank' "were seized pursuant to warrants based on "civil forfeiture complaint filed in the United States court, northern district of Illinois." So on June 9, 1998, we lived in that house that was seized by the FBI, right? Yeah. So, Mama, go ahead, tell your story. Uh, we were, I think, shopping, something like this. W-- we came, and we-- we saw these bunch of women and men in suits-- Were we in the car with you? I think, yeah. I was, "What's going on?" Like, I wasn't aware. I was just say-- Your father's over there. "FBI, FBI." They were just forcing the door, something like this... The door of our apartment? Of the building. I was-- said, "What they are doing?" He said, "I think they are taking over the-- the building." Your father told me, he said... Without... Homeless. Without-- homeless. So we have to think about having another apartment.

If a lady, she's sick or she had her babies, we used to organize ourself... to cook for her, to help her in the house. Wow. Yeah, because they don't have a family here. So we are the family. ♪♪ In 1998, when my little brother and the fifth kid in our family was born, my father decided that we should move to a bigger house in Bridgeview. While the new house was being built, my dad was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer. And a few months after we moved in, he was gone. I remember for weeks after he died, my house was full of family friends and neighbors cooking, and cleaning, and keeping my mother company. At my father's funeral, hundreds of people from around Chicago came to the mosque. The imam asked the community to make a donation in memory of my father to help pay off the remainder of our mortgage. In less than an hour, the community donated more than $200,000. We paid off our home. And 19 years later, we're still here. It's really easy for me to talk about my family, my community, but it's a lot harder to talk about myself. I feel like I can't even begin to tell you who I am without getting into who I'm not. I was ten years old when I became aware that everyone looks at us like we're all a bunch of terrorists. It started with cartoons, all the bad guys in the movies had accents like my parents. I had to slit a few throats, but I got it. We kids were constantly bombarded with images of Arabs and Muslims as radical, backwards, violent villains. Money is power. And so I became aware of how others see me, and I learned how not to come off to people. Not a terrorist, not an alien, not a traitor. Don't talk too loud in Arabic at the mall, don't argue with your parents in public, don't talk with an accent, don't fail in school, don't ever break the rules, don't look un-American. I am constantly juggling within me two conflicting gazes. How I see myself, and how I see myself through the eyes of others. Through the eyes of a world that views me with suspicion and fear.

"In accordance with FBI practice, "this response neither confirms nor denies the existence of your subjects name on any watch lists." Okay. This is really crazy.

And she was just like--Confused. "We left Algeria because of the police, now we're gonna come here 'cause of the police." Yeah, exactly.She's like, "Don't get involved." Oh, that's so funny. Yeah. So it's like a cultural mentality that we're really trying to change, 'cause that's a lot of people's mind-set is that like, "Don't get involved, keep your head ducked down, and that will keep you safe." But we know staying quiet actually hasn't kept anyone safe in this community. Hi! Good to see you. Good to see you. Give me a hug.How're you doing? This'll actually be really straightforward, I think. Okay, cool.I think the judge is gonna kind of say, you know, "Have you come to any agreement?" And we're gonna say "no, and this is what's happened."Yeah. And it'll be nice to meet him, and it's good for him to kind of... see you.Okay, yeah, cool. Yeah, it'll be good.Yeah, so-- A few people will come. It's a status hearing, so they know it'll be short. Yeah. But maybe a handful of people from the community will show up? So we'll see, yeah.Great, great. That's excellent. ♪♪ Good morning, Your Honor. This is Alexa Poletto for Assia Boundaoui, the plaintiff. One year ago, my client, who is a journalist, submitted this FOIA request to the government asking for information which is very much in the public interest. This request was denied by the government. One year later, we don't have a document in hand. The FBI currently has the Russian investigation, James Comey, other things that are headline news. "Headlines" doesn't cut it for me as being more important than a request from a citizen for documents. Today, my real interest is having the government compelled to a schedule to produce documents. The standard the FBI uses is review 500 pages, and processing them on a monthly basis. I don't think 500 pages per month is going to be acceptable in this case for a FOIA request that's been pending since September of last year. Absent something telling me I can't do it, I'm going to order processing at a faster rate than has occurred. I don't think we need to discuss this more. I'll have you back next week. I think Muslim Americans are aware of the threat of increased... As racist groups of the past have gotten new life, like it or not, from Trump. An Islamic center in Houston, Texas burns down in a fire still under investigation. You have individuals who are driven to act on their prejudices and take it out on women who visibly appear to be Muslim. ♪♪ Wow. Look. "Google may have detected government-backed attackers trying to steal your password." I clicked on the "Learn More," and this popped up. That's really frightening. This is all-- all of it is hard. Suddenly it becomes hard to communicate. It's interesting. Once you're under investigation, it's not that you're-- you stop talking to people because you don't trust them, it's because you're afraid that any f-- like, medium of communication is being watched. And so nothing is secure anymore, and so you keep to yours-- I mean, the idea-- like, you become alienated, you can't talk to people about what the fuck is going on. You can't even get the help that you need because you're afraid. So one thing I did that was proactive other than freaking out was I e-mailed that woman at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, Harlo, and I took screenshots of all those things. And I was like... "Is this legit? Because the URL looks legit. Is it legit? And if it is, like, what should I do?" And she responded this morning and she said, "Google has methods of detecting "this type of attacks on people's accounts. "And for some reason, a lot of alerts have been going out to people this past week." So I am going to my mother's house to sleep over for the night. And, uh, been having to find a way to hide all my shit whenever I leave the house because I'm afraid that someone might break into the house, whoever it is that's watching me, and steal my hard drives for the film. So every time I leave the house now, I hide the stuff. ♪♪ Apparently there was a robbery nearby, and there's three me-- or two men on the loose. They already caught one, two more waiting to be caught. So all of our parents are stuck in the mosques and they can't get out till the other two are caught. Your house? No, no, Assia. Please, please. Assia, please. Please... What are you hearing about what happened? The lockdown? I heard that it was an FBI sting that went wrong. Shh. Warrants. So let me-- okay, so that's your theory. Here's what-- we're sitting with one of our neighbors yesterday, and she was saying that they told us that this was a sting or bank robbers. But this was actually a test run... ...to see how Bridgeview reacts? And she said if it was really people with assault rifles that were in our neighborhood loose, why wasn't there a single ambulance? Yeah, exactly. Why wasn't there a single fire truck? Don't you have EMTs waiting? There are three guys loose with assault rifles in the neighborhood, not a single ambulance. Also, if there was no coordination, why exactly when it happened we had seven police departments' cars here? How did they show up so quick? How was there a-- a tank rolling down in front of the mosque? Many times.Many times. The next day in the press, they said this was not a bank robbery. So they told us it was a bank robbery on the day of, and the next day they denied it. They said there was no bank robbed. W-- what? They said, "We refuse to say why." See? That means this-- what we thought was true. I received, yesterday, a motion for an Open America stay seeking essentially to stay any production or at least delay it. The period was some 64 months. We tried to negotiate with the government again this week, and were informed immediately that they would not be entering into any discussions with us. We discussed it with the FBI at the highest level, and they felt that they could not do anything more. It's a fairly extraordinary request, going from saying it will take three years and now requesting essentially a five-year timetable. This is an old criminal investigation, and there's just no justification for that. This is a very serious issue that is very pertinent today to very many Americans. My client is entitled to expedited processing. Whether the FBI thinks that it's a nuisance to have to respond to this, it's still the federal law. I can't change that, you can't change that, and you can't ignore the law. Next Tuesday you'll get a ruling. My name is Assia Boundaoui. I'm a researcher and a journalist, and I actually grew up in this community just a few blocks away from the mosque here. I just wanna begin by saying that, um, I believe strongly that a healthy relationship between law enforcement, government, and our community has to be one that's predicated on trust and transparency. For the past few years, I've been digging into the long, wide-reaching investigation of this Muslim community. These investigations profiled entire communities based on ethnicity and religion, and used a really broad brush to paint law-abiding American citizens as suspect. These might have happened in the past, but people are still living with the effects of these long-term investigations. They've caused, um, profound impacts on our community. Um, and one of them, one that aught to be of concern to government institutions is the lack of trust in law enforcement. We did a survey a couple years ago. 40 % of residents around this mosque here have received visits from the FBI. And so after every terrorist attack in Paris, in Boston, people get visits around here. And right before the elections, many people in this neighborhood received knocks on their doors, asked a number of questions about political affiliations, et cetera. Say we brought that to you, what would-- what are the steps internally within the FBI that you would take to address what we would consider maybe a civil rights concern? Tha-- that's exactly what happened. We-- I actually have it documented. They have-- we have cards, business cards that they handed out. I'm telling you it actually happened. Mm-hmm. Right before the election, so we-- That was in November. I mean, these are just like, things that people in the community have-- have talked about-- If something happens to you and you needed-- the FBI is your champion. So at one time, he is your savior. And another time, he is your Halloween nightmare. No, I mean, you have to-- that's the kind of education we need to tell people. It's gonna continue to take education... ♪♪ He is part of the group of community leaders we have that thinks just saying, you know... just being "yes men" to the FBI, and law enforcement, and local politicians is the way to get a seat at the table. The whole point of having a seat at a table is to advocate on behalf of the community. You know? It's to like-- it's to make sure our community's rights are protected and our interests are being served. Otherwise, what the fuck is the point of having a seat at the table? ♪♪ It's so hard. The hardest part is dealing with this community that's not even fighting against the FBI... What's the point? They're treating me like I'm their enemy. Like, I have to fight them to do this. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Hello? What happened? Oh, my God. You don't ask him, "Who are you"? Mama! Okay, I just took a picture. I'm sending it to your WhatsApp. Look a-- look at it and tell me if that's him. I mean, this picture is about maybe 12 years old. Oh, my God, I'm so scared! He's Robert Wright, the FBI agent who started Vulgar Betrayal. Oh... What's that? Say that again? I missed that. Yeah... Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I usually record all of my phone calls. Um, but if you opt out of that, I don't have to do that. Okay, okay. I cannot record you. I hung up with Bob 20 minutes later. He talked and talked, but didn't say very much at all. The most illuminating part of the conversation was when he told me he had a job to do, and me and my neighbors had a job to do. We're the bad guys doing our bad guy jobs, and he's the good guy doing his good guy job of keeping America safe from us. I thought as a good journalist, I should try and see if Bob would be a source. I reached out for an interview, but when he didn't answer my text I immediately stopped trying. There's no way for me here to separate the personal and the professional. The truth is I don't want anything to do with this guy, and I don't care if that makes me a bad journalist. Can you move it back a little? That's pretty good, though. We can see the whole walkway. We can see the cars. Yeah. But the front door, a little more of the front door, we wanna be able to see. Move it back. Any more of the front door, it'll just be that dark. Back a little more? That's perfect. I know... I don't know. I don't know. When I called him, he said, "Did I scare your mom?" Was that your goal? Were you trying to scare her? Yeah, is it you-- yeah, is it your goal? What do you think? And he laughed. So what came out of your phone call? I was trying very hard to sound very cool, calm, and collected on the phone-- This was all by the phone? Yeah, and not scared. But I was really shook. I was super shook. I was really-- I know I have no reason to be afraid, but I was really afraid. Like, why is he coming t-- he knows where we live, he knows who my mom is, he knows what her face is. Because he had been-- He sauntered into the neighborhood like, "Oh, yeah, my old stomping grounds." Like, that makes me so mad. What's the purpose? Mm-hmm. Why he's here? Yeah, well, I still don't have an answer for any of that. ♪♪ Before the court is plaintiff's motion that compel expedited processing of her request for FBI records concerning the anti-terrorism operation Vulgar Betrayal. Plaintiff is informing the public of the FBI's alleged profiling and surveillance of communities based on race, religion, and ethnicity. In particular, the Arab-American community in Bridgeview. Significant questions about privacy rights are implicated by the plaintiff's project. The court finds that the anticipated five-year timeline for production is patently unreasonable, and plaintiff is entitled to expedited processing. The court orders the defendants to review 3,500 pages per month, and give priority to the subfiles of individuals for whom plaintiff provides privacy waivers. I'm very happy, you guys. I'm so happy. We couldn't have expected-- we couldn't have asked for anything better. Can we do like a, you know, jumping in the air and the kicking thing now? You get arrested... ♪♪ Nobody would like to be the target of a government program called Operation Vulgar Betrayal. Assia Boundaoui grew up in Bridgeview, and she's now uncovering what happened there in the '90s. You've been having some interesting encounters with the government, trying to get files from the government. Um, wha-- how did that spiel out? Because you ended up with an enormous volume of documents. 3,500 pages a month. Which is setting a really important FOIA precedent, in fact, in FOIA litigation that, you know, that you-- if this is in the public interest and you can prove this serves a public interest, that the government has to release. And so the whole idea of this entire project, this entire mission, was to shine a light on something that's been secret for such a long time. When you won your court case, did people make a big deal out of that? Is th-- is that a big-- I mean, 'cause it seems like it would be almost national news. I mean, we were very excited. We were super excited about it. The community was really excited. I-I think they were really surprised. I think they didn't think you go up against the government and win. And that's a very interesting thing, by the way. The FOIA law is very unique to the United States. You know, that while the government can conduct this surveillance and can violate your privacy and freedom of association, freedom of religion, you also have the right to know that they do that. You know? And that's an incredible thing about this democracy is you have the right to know, and you can get the records of them violating your rights. This is the first batch. It looks like, in terms of redacting, like they redacted as much as they--Heavy-handed. Heavy-handed.Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. but, um, we can-- I think we'll be able to glean some things out of this. Okay. ♪♪ This paper here says in 1989, the FBI field office in Indianapolis opened an investigation on the Islamic Trust, and then closed it. I mean, this is really interesting. I had no idea that there was an investigation on the same topic before Vulgar Betrayal. ♪♪ Pending questions and answers. What were the tactics used in Vulgar Betrayal? Informants. Culling informants from the community. Sending FBI agents to people's houses and places of work. Use of immigration officers during FBI interviews.

"In the future, Springfield requests "that Chicago articulate the reasonable belief "that each named person is engaged in criminal activity in support of international terrorism." The things that they found as suspicious about us are actually the things that are most important characteristics of our community. Yeah. We're very philanthropic, and we're connected to each other. ♪♪ I always thought that paranoia is an effect of the investigative tactics that they used. The way they did the investigation caused us to be paranoid. But what if-- what if some of these things are reversed? It's not that this is the cause and that's the effect, what if this was the purpose? Based on historically how the FBI has dealt with communities of color, it's not a stretch of the imagination to say their surveillance methods created paranoia. But in fact, they wanted to create paranoia within the Muslim community. Shake the cage, rattle the cage and see what comes out.Right. And they thought there were terrorists there, so that if they put enough heat and pressure on us, they would come out of the woodworks and they would catch them on a phone call or whatever when they did. But w-- when you rattle a cage and there aren't any criminals crawling out, what does that do to the people in the cage, you know? ♪♪ ♪♪ Everybody in this room knows exactly what we're talking about when we're talking about the increase in surveillance in the community, increase in this presumption that the community is something of a threat. That started from Operation Vulgar Betrayal in the '90s and that informed not just methods of investigation, but also legislation that was enacted post-9/11. Law enforcement and the FBI in particular feel like they can roll into our community and kind of do whatever they want. We want to send the message that no, they can't. And we do that by reporting every single time they come. Checks and balances starts with people. Um, the balance are the courts and Congress. The check is the people. As long as we're scared, and we hide, and we say, "Talking about it somehow makes us more of a target," it actually plays into the entire secrecy of the whole game. As long as people are afraid to talk, then there is no check against the system. We cannot be asleep any longer. This is our country. I wanna raise my boys to be proud of who they are as Arab, as Muslims, as Palestinians, and as Americans. Whether you are a citizen born here or a citizen naturalized, or an immigrant, don't feel that you are less of a citizen than the white man. They definitely understand the fears that our immigrant communities come to this country with. They know we wanna invite them in to have a cup of tea or coffee and prove to them that we're great American citizens. And I just wanna say... It's very simple, do not invite them into your home. ♪♪ A 20-minute drive from my mom's house is the only panopticon prison ever built in the U.S. The panopticon is designed to ensure that the prisoner is seen without ever seeing, and that the guards see everything without ever being seen. The prisoners feel like they are under such constant surveillance that they change their own behavior. Their paranoia becomes as effective a tool of control as actual surveillance. They become silent, docile, alienated. I still don't know for a fact whether the FBI has ever stopped watching us, and perhaps there's nothing that I can do about being watched. Maybe the only thing I can do is make sure that the government is not invisible, that the systems of power are kept in check. It's in the act of looking back and talking out loud that we become less alienated, less petrified by our paranoia. Perhaps the only way to disrupt surveillance is to make sure that those who do the watching are also being watched. ♪♪
