Paris suburbs, 1993 Does your dad still blow his money on gambling? I like your father but he lives like a prince. Even though he's broke. I pity your poor mother. When does university begin? Tomorrow. You'll get lost! I'll drive you. There's no need. I went there yesterday. I can show you the Eiffel Tower. And Paris. Why not? Come here. Closer. Sit down. I know plenty of women. But you're beautiful. Don't be scared. Your aunt will never find out. Why are you scared? Lina, come here. What do you want? - To say something. - What? Let's talk for a second. What is it? I said no. Don't touch me. Ok, I'll stay here. I won't move. Let go! Get off me! Shame on you. - Keep back. - Put that down. I'll kill you! Let go! Drop it! Where are you going? Are you crazy? I was just joking! PARISIENNE Work around here? Work around here? I'm a student. Yeah? At a faculty? The university. - What? - The university. Same difference. Studying what? Economics. Heavy stuff. Coming! Pretty heavy... School isn't my thing. Screw Charlemagne! Hello. Sir? A coffee and a glass of water. A coffee and a glass of water. She left? For fuck's sake... Goddam bitch! My name is Mr Gibert. We'll be spending this first semester together. Concerning papers to prepare... You'll have a list of writings by the great economists, from Adam Smith to John Keyes, via Karl Marx. This list of papers will lead to surprise tests. These surprise tests are important. They'll show us if you are working and, moreover, they represent 50% of your final result. Written or oral papers? I see some haven't understood. You can do an oral or written presentation. For an oral one, you'll need a colleague. Got a spare sheet of paper? I forgot my bag. First lecture and the scroungers are out. Got a pen? 10 francs and a Mars too? What? I was kidding. Thanks. Let's have someone read. The young man in glasses, please. Italian would suit me. - That's mine. - It was on the floor. I thought it was yours. It is, but... Thanks. Can I come with you? - No. - We're going home. Please... I've nowhere to go, no money. I don't know what to do. Where d'you live? In the suburbs. I don't have the keys. - Go to the cops. - I can't. It pissed me off, waiting a half-hour outside the cinema. 30 minutes! Fred, my sister. Lina from uni. She's sleeping here tonight. Sleeping here? She can sleep in my room. - Put your things here. - Thanks. I can't tell you, I... Hold on... Cannes... You see the filmers... and the filmed... - How was my pasta? - Gross. Gross? - You liked it? - Yes. - She's polite. - It was good. Come on, let her speak. I have to tell you... Our mum's coming tomorrow. So I can't be here? You've lost your keys, but you get on with your family? I have no family. My aunt is a distant aunt. And my parents are gone. They're dead. I can't go back to Lebanon. I have no one left. I need to find somewhere to stay. A room, in Paris. We'll help you. There's a women's hostel nearby. Don't you have a grant or a job? No, I don't work. Your boss needs telemarketers. That's not my decision. But you could... - Stop meddling. - You can ask. Fred's a secretary for an estate agent. - When she isn't... - What are you going to say? Posing for photos in catalogues. Put it away, you're boring her. Better than real life, huh? Stop it! Shit, that's Jean! Hi there! You're early. How's it going? Jean... Good evening. Have a good evening. No dessert? No, I'm ok. Thanks for helping. Did you find my wallet by chance or take it from my bag? I found it on the floor. Next to... Ok... It's me. Is Mounira back? I'm at the women's hostel. I'll wait for you. Hello... Sorry about the other night. I didn't mean to scare you. It was a misunderstanding. - Mounira mustn't... - I won't talk! Listen, I'm going to Monaco soon. You could have fun there. The sea, the swimming pool... - Tell Mounira you're at a friend's. - No! Scatterbrained. Totally irresponsible. We were worried sick! What would I have said, if your mother had called? "Your daughter's vanished. She's on the streets." I wasn't on the streets. Simon looked everywhere. He called the police. He's a busy man. He can't stand my family as it is. He'll think we're beggars! - I was at a friend's. - What friend? You only just got here. After 20 years, I have no friends. A university friend. Listen, we put you up, but it's a big responsibility. If anything happens, what do we do? You knew I had to go and fetch the children. Every time I go away, it's a disaster! Bring me the plates. I'm free. I do as I want. What do you mean, free? Are we confining you? You've no money. You won't last a week. You've no residence permit. Are you mad? - I shouldn't have enrolled you. - I'm leaving! At least give me your friend's number! I'll call you with it. You can't leave like this... Yes, I can! Hi. What's up? Could I leave a few things with you? - Your mum's gone? - And the hostel? Was it seedy? Yes. Come on. What's Tolbiac? Where classes are. - Know it? - No. Opposite Bercy, near the Place d'Italie. What's going on? That's for Gagnebin. What's that? Art History. - You'll manage? - Yes, thanks. Who thinks they're ugly in this class? Two ugly boys. This girl, no. This young lady neither. Since no one admits to being ugly, we're in tune with our subject. In this class, we're going to like the ugly. We shall above explore 20th century art... in all its diversity. Expressionism, body-art, and we'll begin with the very father of the ugly, Goya's Cronos. It's an impressive collection. You'll forget all your hang-ups. If you have any, that is! Our fascination for the ugly has remained taboo until now. Yet the ugly is not horror, which is accidental. Nor terror. The ugly is ontological. In other words, part of the essence of man, of his finiteness. In the face of the psychic mutilations that he encounters in life and that he must fight, man carries with him the marks of his inner battles. Most of the time, the ugly appears as the simple negative of beauty. It's very limiting. In actual fact, the ugly attains the deepest and darkest aspects of the human soul. I'd now like you to take a piece of paper... and draw up a short list of what you find ugly. For now, everything is ugly What a mess... You haven't had a medical? It's there. Louder, please, I can't understand. The certificate's there. It's out of date. Like it says, it has to be less than two weeks old. But I'm fine. I don't care if you are. I need another certificate. A recent one. Do new blood tests and bring the right documents. Next! Hello, this is Julie from the Marly agency, specialized business realtors. Do you have offices to sell or need offices to rent or buy? Thank you. More self-confidence. And better diction. I don't want an accent. Keep practising. And I need your residence permit. I'll bring it in. Hello, this is Julie from the Marly agency, specialized business realtors. Do you have offices to sell or need offices to rent? It's on the Champs-Elysées. Rich, good-looking guys... Got a boyfriend? A lover? No. Never had sex? Once, long ago. I'm not interested. You're so lucky! I can't stay alone. I even have charity sex! With some guys, if I don't do it, who will? But the last one... Each time we fucked... it was fireworks! Then, all of a sudden, he just up and vanished. I called him maybe twenty times. I couldn't call the cops. I don't care, I'll find plenty more. Pleased with the job? Yes. So say, "I'm pleased, Antonia." I'm pleased, Antonia. There you go! Let's have this fucking class! Wanna dance, Lina? I'm ok. - Wanna dance? - Yeah! Bored? No, I'm with friends. Not dancing? I'm going to. Go on, I'll watch. Want a drink instead? Champagne Narek. What's Champagne Narek? Narek's the waiter. He's Armenian. I ordered champagne for you. Good translation? Jean-Marc. Lina. Thank you. For me? Bravo. They're for me? Shit, you're luckier than me. Jean-Marc. Looks like he's serious. It's upstairs. Can't decide? There's a lot of choice. Hello, Lucien. - How are you? - Fine, and you? I'm fine, thanks. The young lady can't decide. What would you like? I have a nice morel risotto, a wonderful white truffle omelette... The second one. The omelette. - A sole for me. - Perfect. Do you like it? You often invite girls here? Why do you ask? He spoke as if he'd seen loads of girls with you. You flatter me. - The wine list, sir? - Please. How many girls? I'll tell you, if you want to know. I keep a woman three nights. So two women a week, that's six nights a week. That makes four times six... 24 nights a month. And, each year, that makes... 288 women. That's 288 nights. That makes 288 dinner dates. No, I don't invite them all here. I'd get bored if I did. He's on the drums. He pretends not to love her. She can't stop kissing him, but he acts cold. When she left for the USA, he drank, did drugs and slept around. They're back together. Those two have always been together, like Nicolas and Hélène. Then José and Bénédicte. Bénédicte is new. She loved Christian, but never told him. You see? - It's simple. - Wild, you mean. I want some fun. Let's have a drink and go clubbing. - What can you wear? - Don't know... I can't find his number. You put it in your bag. Here. A heterogeneous work. This store was a book to be read, a sculpture made up of various items: a salad shaker, a bicycle wheel, etc., and a meeting place, as the Supports/Surfaces group held many exhibitions there. This composition, cobbled together over the years, is called "Anything" by Ben and... he's not wrong! Saying art can be anything marks a revolution in thinking. Some artists, for example... Thank you, Thomas. ...with bare hands and feet climb a huge ladder studded with sharp metal teeth. Gina Pane, in 1971. Or, in the basement of an exhibition... That's the wrong photo, Thomas. Nor that one. Hurry now... ...masturbation to the rhythm of the visitor's footsteps. We have no photos of that. Unfortunately. We also have... Joseph Beuys: "Explanation of a Painting to a Dead Hare", 1965. Also Richard Kern with a Christ covered in excrement. And Rodolphe Schwartz Kogler and his nude wrapped in wet bandages and electric wires, live ones, beneath a hail of razorblades. Are these artists illusionists as Plato would think? Or, as art is "anything", are they violent artists? How can we qualify such liberty? Such intoxication in action? What use is it all? I'm asking you that. I'll see you next week for a new class. Remember to visit museums. That's very important. I need to see three students. Maximilien Renard, Cyril Rigoni and Lina Karam, please. - Are you Lina Karam? - Yes. I'm correcting work and had to tell you I was very touched by what you wrote. But you're not enrolled in my class. You're not on the list. That's bothersome. I have too many students to take on more. I enrolled in Economics by mistake. I'd just arrived in France and I got confused. But I want to take your class. I like it. - How long have you been here? - Two months. I'm from Lebanon. What do you think of our fine country? I don't know. Waiting to see? Wait for me, we'll try to save your hide. Thank you. - Pretty handbag. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Thomas, put the slides away in the right order, please. Yes, ma'am. Lina Karam. She's written three letters, to no avail. What are you waiting for? I'm sorry, I have no idea... If you had it, you'd have found it. Yes... I think so. When was the... What is the problem? A mistake in the confirmation of her options. You did it by Minitel? It's problematic. She'd like to attend my class but another one was selected. That's easy to correct, Mrs Gagnebin. We'll do it right away. I know it's easy. So I wonder why it wasn't done sooner. I have a teacher, a new one, called Gagnebin. She talks about artists, how they're different and free. They're lucky... What painter do you like? I like Manet. His pictures of flowers and roses. Everything he painted before he lost his leg. He said, "I'd like to paint them all before dying." - Got my messages? - I don't know Manet. - You don't know Manet? - No. What are you doing? You like to act mysterious. I thought of you yesterday. My hands reached out for you. Stay on it. I'll call you tomorrow. - Is this your office? - Yes. You do deals here? You're the boss? She's your wife? Yes, she's my wife. You don't love her anymore and cheat on her? Love has nothing to do with it. What is it then? I'm very happy I met you. I think you're stunning. You're a gorgeous woman. You mean you want to sleep with me? Don't you? No. You're scared? You like being scared? Let's talk about Marivaux. I'll tell you a secret. When I read Marivaux, I feel 20 again. Women in Marivaux! The problem with Marivaux is a reputation that disadvantages him. He describes the share of instability and indecision in each one of us. The mystery of attraction... The refined banter that can appear as inconsistency, and that some accuse him of, namely Voltaire who says, "He weighs flies' eggs on spider web scales." He means he's a nit-picker. Exactly. You need to fall in love to understand what Marivaux writes. That seething energy blithely contaminates each protagonist by sowing the seed of madness in the characters' behaviour. "In truth, "it all resembles a dream," says the maid in "Les Fausses Confidences". And it's that dream we'll be studying. You're not saying much. It's weird being here with you. In a château. It's like being in a French novel. Why a French novel? They're full of lovers. And everyone finds it normal. As if that were real life. I'm happy to show you real life then. Leave it on. Why? I want to see you. No... What? I can't. Leave it on, I said. I'm too ashamed. Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes while I fuck you. I'd like you to remember this moment when you're alone in bed, when you go to classes... On the metro with your friends... I want you to remember it. I was afraid you'd leave me. No way... I didn't want to wake you. It's 'cos you said three nights. This date here... You changed it? No, look... You can see the mark. Your file is complete. I get my residence permit? Come back for it in ten days. I need it for work. Can I have it now? Ma'am, you're not here to work, but to learn... That means I have it? Yes, you have it. Lina? Come in here. I need a word. I forgot my residence permit again. It's not that. I have some good news for you. You've made a 750-franc bonus. 750 francs? You helped make a sale and I'm very pleased. Thank you so much. You can even do a little overtime. Yes, I can. Fetch Frédérique. I need to talk to her. She made a sale too? Not exactly, no. - I'll fetch her. - Thank you. Can I have a word? Why are you crying? You don't steal others' work! You're dishonest. I knew it right away. - I didn't mean to. - What? Playing the poor immigrant again? Fuck you! And find another place. - I'm sorry... - Screw sorry! Can I speak to Jean-Marc? He's not here. Who is this? Do you steal a lot? Who are you? Julien! I paid for that cappuccino. How much do you want? You want money? Keep it, it's ok. It was on me. Thanks. How's university? I told you last time, school isn't my thing. I quit after high school. It's been odd jobs since. I could've caught you last time. Want to go for coffee? No. Shit... What? I just realized I'm wearing a pink shirt. I'm with a pretty girl in Paris and I'm in a pink shirt. Know anyone who wants to rent out a room or a small apartment? I can ask around. Forget it. Bye. Take care, ok. You're beautiful, Lina. I have to go. Lina! Lina! You know my sister's being fired 'cos of you? It's not my fault! It's not my fault, Antonia! Sure! I should've realized when you tried to rob me. You pulled the wool over our eyes. I called your cousin or someone. You're no orphan. I lied 'cos my uncle wanted to sleep with me! I was desperate! That's so low, trying to kill off your own family! Give me my bag! You have two weeks to pick up your stuff. That's not how things work in France. Here. Can you manage? Yeah, I'm ok. Want some help? Thank you. Lina brought Lebanese cakes. Lebanese? What's that? Arab? No, not at all. We have a few Arabs, but it's a mix. You made them? No, I bought them. Yeah? I'll try one. There's honey in them? Nice. It's good. We're for a monarchy. It could help revive patriotic feeling and also revive French cultural heritage. 'Cos France has had problems for 200 years now, see. - It's fucked up. - Exactly. Even foreigners think and say the same thing. So you see, it's not some abstract thing. You understand? The wogs have no money, so they steal. - To take it back home. - Stop. Calm down, Arnaud. - And I prefer wogs to queers! - Stop! I didn't know that. France is in a bad way. And you can really sense it now. There's not enough work. And that's not a racist thing. We just want the best for our country. And to welcome those we take in properly. We work and pay our taxes. And for who? And for whom? - For foreigners. - People who don't work. You understand? That's the problem. I called you. Why are you here? A surprise, it's my birthday. Maybe we could go somewhere. It's over, Lina. Everything ok, baby? Sweetheart, it's so good to hear your voice! I called your friend. No one answered. I've moved out, to a bigger apartment... I'll give you the number. I wish I'd been there. What did you do for your birthday? I was with friends. So you weren't alone? No, I'm not alone. It feels like you left years ago. I miss you. I have to wait until the end of the year to see you. We don't see your brother. He stays shut in his room. Time stands still and the days are long. Your father wanted to talk to you, but he isn't here now. And I miss you. Your father too. But he doesn't say it, you know. His health isn't good either. But I'll say no more... He refuses to see a doctor. Hello? Can you hear me? I can't hear you anymore. Take care, sweetheart. Miss... Miss... You can't stay here on the grass. Miss... Up you get. Sorry. I read Pascal again last Sunday and thought of you. "Let each of us examine his thoughts; he will find them wholly concerned with the past or the future. We almost never think of the present and, if we do think of it, it is only to see what light is thrown on our future plans. The present is never our end. Thus, we never actually live, but hope to live. And since we are always planning how to be happy, it is inevitable that we should never be so." Men are strange. They beat against the past, dream of the future. They have stopped living. If we were truly in the present, we could be happy. Instead of that, during all this time, we sleep. We are uneasy sleepers. We are the living dead. I want to get away from here. I want to go to the USA. Maybe I'll never come back. I'd busk on the streets. But at least I'd be free. I'm a bit like you, see. I'd have gone anywhere. I didn't really choose. I came to France because I knew people here. My aunt... But we don't talk now. So I don't know why I'm here. France chose you. France... If you say so. What do you listen to? What music, I mean. I don't know. Everything. You can't say everything. That's impossible! You can listen with one ear like Van Gogh who looked at landscapes with one ear. You can't listen to everything. Do you like endives with ham? Yes. Why? I know a top restaurant. Let's try these endives. The best in Paris. Excuse me. - Yes? - Danielle sent me. Give me for 200. Let me know first. I'm sorry. Here. Tell Danielle to get fucked. Want some music on? It's good. France has trouble with rock music. Why? Helno, the singer with Les Négresses Vertes, is compared to the Pogues' singer but they're nothing alike. - Know why? - No. Vision. Helno is nuts. That's why he's so funny. I saw him live. He came out looking like this... Just like this. Then he fell like this. - Are you ok? - Yeah. He fell straight down. People were yelling, "Stop, Helno, you're fucking it all up!" And he fucked up. He killed himself? No, maybe he should have. The following week, he was on Sunday afternoon TV. Here you go... Frank Black. Black Francis, the Pixies' leader. I like his mug. What's his mug? His face. His mug. He's really cultivated too. I'm almost jealous of him. This is a great one. You listen to it loud. - He's in Paris on Friday. - What? Frank Black. He is? Want to come with me? Ok. I have to go or I'll miss the last metro. You're in the suburbs? No, in Paris, in a palace. A hostel actually. The Palais de la Femme. Ok... I'll walk you back. What are you doing? Just borrowing some money. It's only to buy food. - My bag! - I'll pay you back! Let go of my bag! Let go! Shut the fuck up! Help! Fucking hell... What's going on here? She tried to steal my bag. Come with me. Bitch! Lina! - Hi. - How are you? What happened? I'm sick of hostels. Got any ideas? I'll try to think. It's ok being a racist, but you look fucking dumb. - You talking to me? - Hold on... Calm down. What was that? It's ok being a racist, but you look fucking dumb. - Want a fight? - Jerk! Arnaud, stop it! - Stop it! - Fucking Red! Communist asshole! - Piss off! - Fucking queer. Moron! That'll clean your shit! I'll waste you! Piss off! So this is it. There you have... The kitchen. The kitchen corner. Here, you have a table, with chairs if you have guests. There's an oven here. The bed's over here... Right here. And a TV set and a telephone. And a bathroom over there. All right. Thanks. There's a glitch, but I'll mend it. Thank you. You'll see to the tap? It's cute. Don't hesitate to make yourself at home here. What's he doing? It's leaking even more. Don't hit it. I'm fucking trying to mend it! Don't hit it with that. Use the spanner. It's seized up. There, that's done it. It's all good now. Turn it on then! I bet it's broken. Try turning it. You see. He broke it. Fuck! We'll have to call a plumber. - You broke it. - It's fixed. It's broken. If it doesn't work, I'll use the other one. Cold water in the kitchen and hot in the bathroom... - I'll call a plumber. - It's ok. Get my books and we'll go. The money... Thanks, it's a big help. Here. We'll see if you can stay longer. If anyone calls, give them my number. Yes. This is for two months. Great, thanks. See you. Thank you, Victoire. And Arnaud too. See you at uni? Sorry. It's all right. Bye. You're hopeless! How could he look at each person? Girls always believe singers look them in the eye. Singers use a sweeping technique. Frank Black didn't look at you. - You looked at me... - Yes, I missed half the gig. Got friends at uni? No... Yes, I have one friend. She's a royalist. Are you sure? Of what? Yes. She's a right-wing extremist? No, she's not a racist. She thinks royalists are better for France. But her guy's a skinhead. He's dumb, totally dumb. What's so funny? Stop it, they're nice. Don't make fun, they're nice. Cut it out! I'm laughing 'cos your only friend is a nazi. You're mean. You kiss well for a fascist. Hold on... I like when it's dark. This is Ben. A great guy. How's it going? Give me five minutes. Where are you going? All alone? A pretty girl like you, lost? Know what that jerk Pasqua wants? The death penalty for all queers, junkies and alcoholics. Instead of bombing Milosevic. But he's mulling over that. We're just small fry. We love our creature comforts here. Creature comforts! You jerks! You can't even move your asses! Yeah, sure! Julien? Julien? Where were you? Let's split. - I gave you something last time... - I know. You promised me... We're going. We just got here. What were you doing? - Let's split. - What were you doing? Shit, the cops... Give it to me! Walk slowly, ok? Your identity papers! Your papers! We stop? - Let go of him! - Cool it! - Let go! - Where's your dope? - Give me your bag! - Leave her be! - Where's the dope? - Are you nuts? Shut up or I'll book you! Got it? - We're clean. - A residence permit. - Is this yours? - Yes. - Who's your dealer? - Is it real? Who? Where's the dope? Go easy on her. You're hurting me. Shut up! Getting turned on? Take your shit. - Get lost! - Take your shit. - Have a good evening. - Sure. Fuckers... Where's my residence permit? Assholes. You shouldn't have. You really scared me. It could've been bad for you. They'd have let me go right away. It was so good for once, I didn't want it to end. And I wasn't afraid. We screwed them over. You were beautiful, even getting arrested. What's it like? Fresh air. Illusions with no real meaning. Want to try? No. Don't stop. What are you doing today? It sucks. Don't stop, it was beautiful. Something livelier then. "Abandoned by my family, it seemed natural to aggravate the situation by loving boys, capping this love with stealing, and stealing with crime or addiction to crime. And so I deliberately rejected a world that had rejected me. I tallied up the singularity of my misfortunes." On looking at Jean Genet's life, you'll see that the narrator identifies with the author but reinvents the facts as he sees fit. This isn't a literature class but Jean Genet interests me for the way he exposes the principles of his poetry and the foundations of a subversive ethic. His story... Mum, is that you? What's up with your dad? He's sick. My mom wants me to go home. When'll you be back? After the summer, perhaps. We'll write. Write to my aunt's. The mail service is bad in Beirut. - We'll call each other? - Of course. You know, when I came here... I told stories about the war to interest people. I said I'd seen explosions and dead people. That I was an orphan. None of it's true. You don't see anything in a war. You just hear the noise. Bombs whistling and exploding... All day, all night, that's what you hear. But I mostly heard my parents. They shouted all the time. We were a family in spite of ourselves. I could tell we wouldn't stay together long. It was like one big lie, our family. I'm mad at myself... Mad at myself for hating them... and hiding here. You're not hiding. You truly exist here. You're not hiding. Sweetheart? Don't worry, dear. Your father won't suffer. The doctor said so. It'll be over in a few weeks. Thank God. What does that mean? How do you know? What does the doctor know? Where's God? I told you, don't blaspheme! You just thanked God that he's going to die! - Move, stupid. - Bigot... Asshole! Son of a bitch! Fuck! I said to let me drive. - My nerves will snap. - Your nerves? How can you drive, dear? Drive, Mum. You're too high, son. - You can talk! - Is this how you thank me? Like this? Yes. Shame on you! Ungrateful brats... Your mum pops pills from dawn to dusk. - For her hand, for her shoulder... - Me? - And I'm high? - You're a junkie! No, you're the junkie! My son, a junkie! My mother's the junkie! I don't do drugs. - A junkie, me? - Yes, you! Dawn to dusk, 16 pills a day. Weed is screwing your mind up. Like your pills. Just drive... - I raised you badly. - That's for sure. - You should focus on studying... - And you on driving. So teach me! Come on then! The sea's beautiful. The weather too. I'm glad we came today. What's your boyfriend's name? Julien. Is he French? How old? Handsome? Fair hair? Yes, he's French. He's 27. - Want to see him? - You bet. I have a photo. He's so cute! He has fair hair. Nice! When I was in France, I couldn't get on with them. I dated a guy who wasn't even French. It didn't work. Why not? The French like to stick together. They don't get on with foreigners. Here, we live together. We're never alone. How do you manage there? It's not right. Force him to eat. Welcome! Hello. God preserve you. How are you, niece? You'll stay, we hope. I'm just back to see Dad. What's over there? My studies. You heard, she just wants to see her father. Your father mistreated me all his life. And he's still doing it. I'm sick of it, brother. This has to stop. We have to feed him. I'll hold him and you make him eat. But we can't stay like this. People talk. No one makes Dad do anything. No one. - He mistreated me. - Stop crying. Enough! What's up with her? Unlock the door, I said! Unlock it or I'll break it down! Keep away! You stubborn idiot! Get out! Let go of me! Let go of me! Everyone out! All of you! Get out of my sight! I'm sick of you all! Dad? Hi. Is Julien here? Julien's left. He's in the States. He lent me his place. I've moved in here. When'll he be back? No idea. He took his things and left. But I called him! I don't know what to say. Julien's gone away. Got something for him? - No. - No? That's not for him? No. Thanks. Ok. What's your name? It's ok. See you. Bye. I don't believe it! Keep going! What is this? Lina! The potatoes are turning black. What do we do? - Sorry. - Cook them twice or they turn black! I showed you! Go on... I have to cut them too! Always running late. My onions... Nathalie! Are the tables set, dammit? Just a minute. The plates! We can't sink any lower than this. And that's a good thing. I hope you've washed them. How's it looking? "We regret to inform you that your request "to renew your residence permit for 1995 is pending judgement..." The attackers were a man of 25 and a young woman aged barely 20. Their murderous spree began at 9:30 pm at the Pantin pound. They held up the guards, stole their weapons and stopped a cab. Interior Minister Charles Pasqua paid tribute to them last night. These pen-pushers are tiring. I have an appointment next month. My file is pending because I can't switch courses. Unless I get a grant. I can do you a certificate but grants are hard to get. Really? I think you need a lawyer. A lawyer will want a lot of money. - Am I disturbing you? - No, Evelyne. I have a friend who's a lawyer. I can ask him about it. I'll keep you posted. All right. Thank you. I'm making no promises, but I hope it will work. How do you get by? - Do your parents help? - No, I work. You have a job? Yes, I peel potatoes. Illegally. It's not easy... Well then... Gagnebin told me, but I forgot. Sorry. What are you studying? I was doing Economics, then Comparative Literature and Art History. I switched. - The prefecture calls it... - "Academic regression". But I've progressed! Last year, I worked for a realtor. The boss had problems, so I had to quit. And I worked too much. I overdid it. But she told me to work like that. I didn't know it would be a problem... Plus I'm subletting. I was living with my aunt but we don't speak anymore. My uncle neither. I had to leave. And I've run out of money. Basically, you're bad news. Right... Sorry, I can't help you. I deal with people who want to stay here, some desperate cases, believe me. Your case isn't tragic. It is, I don't want to go back! I just want to stay here. I understand. Yes? No, Rafaël. You can't just walk in there, ok. This place smells like an ashtray. You shouldn't smoke so much this early. Your son's here... I'm taking the printer, Dad. I won't be home for dinner. Ok, but bring it back this time! Call your mum to tell her. Yeah. - Do you know my son? - No. - He's at your university. - I don't know him. What was I saying? That you're too busy to help. When are you seeing Immigration? In two weeks. Hi. Just give us the flyer... Come to the meeting, Monday at 6. Hi. Can I sit? - Hi. - I'm Nathalie. I work in a union and we need people. To fight capitalism. The way the bourgeoisie treats workers is terrible. It's important to get involved. I'm not into politics. How can you say that? You've worked. I'm not into it. I don't have a residence permit, so all that... But you're here. - So you're involved. - I don't care. Know what it's like slaving away for a pathetic pension? Come to our meetings. What is it? You think it's funny? Ok... Hi, Madam Mao, how's it going? Get off my back. You spoke to me? - You talk to turncoats now? - Piss off and write your rag. Is it love that makes you so radiant? You're so hot, it's a tidal wave of pheromones. You're a jerk. And you're hot to trot. You're laughing? I'm outta here. Take your flyers. I love her. Are you wavering between the far right and the far left? How does it look? - What is this? - The fucking printer guy. We'll find someone else. Sophie... Pierre... This is Lina. Sit down. What has he gone and done now? Has he done the inside pages right? Look at the centre page. Fantastic. - It looks good. - Take one, it's our paper. The fourth issue will be great. Subscriptions on page 4. It's a real newspaper? It doesn't look like one? We only have one vendor so far, but we'll invade France. Let me explain. Posting bills is simple. You need good shoes so you can run away. A bucket with a wide bottom to stand on... And a stick. Why a stick? To hit people with. I'm kidding. It's to stir the glue. - With that, you're all set. - I can do that. I run fast. I'll be deported soon anyway... Come with us next time we post bills. - We're all going? - I don't know. I can write too. About your adventures with Immigration? No, about Manet, say. Manet? That's nice. We needed an undocumented Arab to have an article on Manet. To the article on Manet. To our new journalist. What's up, Sophie? Nothing. - You don't like Manet? - I do! - You should've written it. - You'd have read it? The atmosphere's usually good... Screw you. I got Debord's insolence right away. I want that insolence in this paper. To reach the 15 guys who'll start a revolution. 15? They'll need a drink or two first. There were 400 of them for the Russian Revolution. 15 will be enough in France, if they're drunk. You've read Debord? I don't know revolution, I know war. She doesn't know France. I do, by heart. - You do? - I know all the regions. - Want me to name them? - In order. Alsace, Aquitaine, Auvergne, Lower Normandy, Ile de France... - Brittany. - Brittany, Burgundy. The Centre, Franche-Comté, Corsica, The fuckers tagged the door again. - Your paper's here? - Yeah. - Fuck it. - We need white paint. It's always the same assholes! Come in, Lina. They didn't break in. What a mess... Want a drink? The black stamp is for a rejected application. What? The black stamp is for a rejected application. - Got another account? - No. The family ties in France are weak. And we've detected inconsistencies. Plus you've worked more than part-time. The authorities have decided not to renew your residence permit. You have a month to leave France. My lawyer said I could lodge an appeal and complete the year. Ask your lawyer. Wait for your receipt. Number 72, please! Number 72, please. Number 72. Don't forget your roots. You'll always be a foreigner here. Even I want to go back. What a life! Screw liberty. People die and no one cares. A man got ran down the other day and no one stopped. Why don't you come to see us? You're here? That's nice. Ok, honey? Great, and you? Have you done Lina's accommodation papers? I forgot. I'll do them. A letter came for you last week. A letter for me? Can I have it? Of course. I'll make dinner. You'll eat with us? - No. - You must. I was fond of your father. I understand your grief. But try to loosen up. Forget that other business... Don't touch me. No one surprises anyone else here. Everyone looks really weird. It's like being in a movie, an extra on a film set. But if you touched someone, the movie wouldn't stop. A taxi-driver asked me if I found New York beautiful. I answered yes. He said he did too but many people see it as filled with savages. I'm off to Arizona to cross the desert. The past is clear here. Too much air, too much freedom. This is what being a foreigner means. It's fantastic. I'm so lost here, I can't make music. But I'm happy, even though I'm thinking of coming back. I want to see you too. I often think of you. I'll write in a few months. Julien. Hey, peabrain! You and your fairy philosophy... Polluting the city again? What d'you want? First, you get a beating. Then, we'll tidy up. Let go of him! Piss off! Don't fucking touch her! Piss off! He gets it. Piss off, you. Are you ok? Does it hurt? It's ok, thanks. Good job it missed your eye. When's the hearing? The 21st. It'll be healed by then. You're pretty anyway. You'll stay for dinner? - I never said no. - You didn't, you said it wasn't right. No, I congratulated you! You congratulated me? I don't give a damn! I know you don't. - I do as I want. - Good. Can we change the subject? This jerk will vote for the right soon! So? Le Pen will get in thanks to you! He always will! Honey... He's too dumb to be our son. Is this usual? - It's funny. - Yes, it's funny. You're talking crap! Try to see further. Be polite. - Mum, we're talking. - Ok, but calm down. He gets carried away. Just change the subject. I'll explain to you about May '68. I'd really like to be there when you do to hear your view of May '68. Your mum's right, let's drop it. You've worn the topic out. - Worn it out? - I think you have. So what do we talk about? You're touchy, just like I am. Touchy? With the crap you talk, good job I'm touchy! I'm not touchy, I'm a militant. Stop spitting at me. I didn't choose the couscous! Say it's your mum's fault for cooking Moroccan. Go ahead. If you're so smart, help her with her papers. - What're you waiting for? - He'll help. I'll help but not while we're eating. That's hypocritical. I'm going to, ok. I said I'll do it. Thank you. You can joke about anything but not with just anyone. You wear me out. You're a great revolutionary... We need to change. We're going it change the whole paper! So change! "Itinerant collective work. The printing tools..." We'll read him this. "The printing tools were as simple as could be. A few boxes of type, a small and sticky cylinder, a large one covered with fabric as a printing roller, two bottles of ink and a few brushes or sponges. All organized to be packed away in minutes." Unlike our stuff. We'll make our own printing press. "Empty-handed, they were attacking a mighty power and its absolute ruler. The anarchist treatise calls all conspirators dreamers of the absolute." Exactly. What's he doing? Move! Fucking move! Parisians... Always screwing up. - Close your eyes. - No... Go on, it's a surprise. - Are they closed? - Yes. Can I open them? No. Are you ok? - Like it? - Yes. This was the Renault plant once. It's like a huge place floating gently on the Seine... Beautiful, huh? Yes. Worried about the hearing? No, I'm not afraid. I have to tell you something. What? You know Julien... I think about him. I can't help it. Shit. If he comes back, you'll leave me? He won't come back. Maybe I'll be gone when he does. If he comes back, I'll have to clout him. I'm not joking. Neither am I. I'm ready to fight for you. Is this Julien tough? Yes. Shit. I did pretty good last time. Yeah. I need to take some classes and bulk up a bit. I have a bit of time before he comes back. Screw Julien. Even if they deport you, I'll follow you. I'll follow you everywhere. They're running late but everything will be fine. Is this judge usually late? I don't know him either. Let the hearing begin. You may sit. You've been in France for five years. You have no diplomas. You're not enrolled anywhere. What have you been doing all this time? I sculpt. Is that all? Yes, that's all. You have insufficient funds, a child born two years ago... How do you earn your living? I sell a few pieces and I get a little benefit. My son is French. Your demands, Mr Prosecutor? Application of the law. The court thanks you. You may wait for our ruling. Next case. Miss Lina Karam. Step closer. I speak for Miss Lina Karam. Very good. Don't worry. Tell them I thought we were free in France. I won't forget. Your Honour, this is a paradoxical case. Right wing politicians claim... Please stick to the case. That is the case, your Honour. Foreigners are accused of coming to France to get rich on welfare handouts. They have an easy life and inflate our social security deficit, while on the other hand... We've seen your routine before. You're not in parliament here. Your Honour, I agree. But this is a serious matter. She's a good student and works too much. The energy of youth that she brings to France by working overtime... She thought she was free. The author of her deportation order did not show the same zeal. He forgot to mention article 23.7 of the ruling of April 13th, 1967. So you realize, your Honour, you simply must cancel this order. Liberty must be defended and sometimes earned. Thank you. We'd have preferred you to begin with that. The hearing is suspended. The ruling will be delivered after the recess. I'm going for a smoke. All right. You have a good lawyer, you're lucky. Been here long? Two years. If they deport me, I don't know what I'll do. I've forgotten so much. I don't want to go back. It's not the poverty, I'm just scared. There's no hope back there. I was stifling. It's not easy living here but at least it's peaceful. You can be yourself with no one watching you. And when you finally understand people here, you can even be happy. That's impossible in my country. Just living peacefully, respected as a person... Fear drowns out our voices. When you're scared all the time, when you can't work, talk or walk down the street... When no one can protect you, your country is nothing. It doesn't even exist. Let the hearing resume. Please sit. The court's rulings are as follows: Mr Daniel Gomis... Yes. You will be escorted to the border. Mr Ben Mira, Kamel. The deportation order is cancelled. Thank you, your Honour. Mr Ahmed Taraoui. You will be escorted to the border. No! Your Honour... Miss Bogdana Rizea. You will be escorted to the border. Miss Lina Karam. The court cancels the deportation order. Today's hearing is over.
