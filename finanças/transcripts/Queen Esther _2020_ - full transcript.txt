Everyone has a story. Pay attention to what you are about to see. Don't miss a moment. The author's hand is in every detail. How do I know this is true? Because what you are about to see is my story. "In the days when King Xerxes was seated on the throne, "the Persian Empire stretched from India to Ethiopia. "Eager to display his splendor, "the young king threw an extravagant feast at his magnificent palace "for everyone in the imperial city of Susa." These are days for celebration. Serve the royal wine. Cyrus the Great conquered this land and liberated our nation. Now, one generation later, we feast in the grandest city in the world. Susa! Susa! But not all is well tonight, for an old enemy lurks on the horizon. So the time has finally come. I will overtake that rebellious shining jewel across the sea. The Greeks will bow to Persia. Hatach. Summon the queen. And you make sure she wears her crown. Queen Vashti was the most beautiful woman in the land. Her family had worn the crown from generation to generation. She was descended from true royalty and everyone knew it. - No. - Pardon me, my queen? It's undignified. I will not be part of that indulgent spectacle. If he thinks he can prove his nobility by commanding me to appear, my husband is mistaken. But he is the king. He is the son of a stable boy. I am a true queen. The empire was prepared for victory. King Xerxes was prepared to seal his legacy. But no one was prepared for what happened next. My subjects, I give you my queen, Vashti. Where is she? Where is my wife? She says she's not coming. Your Majesty. All people throughout your land must follow your commands Even the queen How could she? This could spread like a disease Women doing as they please Think of the trouble they could bring She will pay for this. She's wronged not only you But the entire nation too I'm afraid we must do something Vashti's fate hung in the balance. Persian law was clear. Whatever the King decreed could never be changed. Scribes. Summon the scribes. Princes of Persia speak. What is your counsel? Issue this decree. All Persian wives... All women of Persia are to give honor to their husbands. They must comply And because she disobeyed, the crown will be taken from Vashti. Let it be done once and for all Everybody knows that pride comes before the fall Take him to the gallows. Hail Xerxes, King of Kings and... Lord of Lords This is where our story begins. By order of the King "That all Persian wives give honor to their husbands." "That Vashti be banished from the presence of the King." "And let her crown be given to a more worthy woman." Long live Xerxes Hadassah? Hadassah, what are you doing here? - I went to the King's market. - You what? I thought I could get something special for Sabbath. Look at this. That does smell nice, but I don't want you wandering around with all these vagabonds in town for the King's festival. - Hello, beautiful. - Keep walking. Especially with your face uncovered. Now, what is all this? - Some of it's for Abigail. - You bought her groceries last week. She's alone, Mordecai. Not with us living next door. She eats like a queen. He defends the widows and orphans, he loves even the strangers living among us. - He gives them food and clothes. - You're an excellent student. And you're an excellent teacher. - Now get going. - Shalom, cousin. - Shalom. And cover that face. She's growing up quickly, Mordecai. Have you started looking for a husband for her yet? We need to get back to work. She could have her pick of any man in Susa. She's not going to marry any man in Susa, Levi. She's going to marry a fine young Hebrew boy. - Who? - I'll decide who, Eli. - When? - I'll decide when. She isn't one of your ledgers, Mordecai. It isn't that simple. You don't think I know that? I know that. She was six years old when she came to live with me. Things were simple then. I ate, she ate. I slept, she slept. I talked, she listened. - Now things are... - Complicated? - Women are. - Listen. God gave her to me, not you. - I'll seek his guidance, not yours. - Is Mordecai here? - I can't get anything done. - I have the ledger from the gate. Any chance you could take a look at it for me? Amir, I manage your personal finances, not the empire's. Okay. Just one favor then. I keep going over it, but between the festival and the coming war... - I'll see what I can do. - Yes, I'll pick it up tomorrow. Tomorrow's the Sabbath. Oh, right. Your traditions. - You can pick it up first of the week. - Ah, yes. You're the best accountant in the city. When are you going to come and work for me at the gate? Work for this king? - Never. - Never say never. - Never. Your stubbornness is going to be the death of you, Mordecai. Goodbye. There she is. Talk to her. I can't. I can't do it. Hey, what is the worst that could happen? She could talk back. She's coming. Come on. Go. Good Habbath, Sadaffa. You mean "Good Sabbath", Caleb? - Oh! She knows my name. - She does. I've decided to call you honey. Why's that? - Because you draw the flies. Hello, Abigail. I got this for you from the King's market. I told you I don't need charity. But I have always wanted something from the King's market. Ooh. Your cousin won't like this. Mordecai is more thoughtful than people think. He hides it well. - I have a little something for you too. No, Ruthie, come back here. Oh! Apparently the whole neighborhood is glad you're home. We got to get her out of there before Mordecai returns. Come on in. Hello, Ruthie. - What a sweet girl. - Mmm-hmm. She loves you, Hadassah. Ruthie loves everybody. Not true. She never runs to Mordecai. Oh, this is doing well. You put ashes in the soil like I told you. - They seem to be working. - Hmm. Ashes bring life. It reminds me of the hadass trees that grow all over Israel. So beautiful. Strong, too. Mmm... Your parents named you well. Hadassah. Now, listen. They placed you in Mordecai's care to raise you. But God placed you next door to me so I can help out where your mother no longer can. So... Here. I love it. I wore it the day I married Samuel. And the day is coming for Mordecai to find you a proper husband. Oh, well, he hasn't really talked about it. It's going to take a very special man to marry you. Abigail, I don't think... We'll just hang this up right here behind these other things as a subtle reminder to help him. It's what I always did with Samuel, and it always worked. What is that dog doing in my house? Leaving. Oh... Come here, Ruthie. Oh, let's get you away from that grumpy old man. Hmm. Thank you for the groceries, honey. Say goodbye to Mordecai. Oh! I know he scares me, too. Good Sabbath. What a day. You heard about the latest decree? Everyone was talking about it at market. Clearly, this king doesn't understand anything when it comes to marriage. When the time comes for you to get married... Yes. The sun is going down. Sabbath is about to begin. - Um, I'll get the challah bread. - I'll get the oil lamp. As the prophet Isaiah said, "I will make you a light to guide the nations..." "And you will bring my salvation to the ends of the earth." And here we sit at the ends of the earth. Wait. I know that you won't live with me forever. But how am I supposed to find a young man worthy of you? - Your parents trusted me. - They were right to trust you. - Be still and know he is God. - ... he is God. You're an excellent student, Hadassah. His word is a lamp unto your feet. - Hide it deep in your heart. - I will. Promise me you'll always remember who you are. I promise. We should pray. O Lord, we bless your name What is so urgent that it can't wait until tomorrow? Xerxes wants Vashti back. - Oh, no. - I knew it. - I knew this would happen. - Well, the law cannot be changed. You should never have suggested her removal. It doesn't matter. Xerxes will blame all of us. I have a plan. Haven't you caused enough trouble already? My wife won't even let me back in the house. My wife is obeying me. She's just not talking to me. - Another decree? - Just read. We are to gather the most beautiful women from across the empire for Xerxes to choose from? No Persian king has ever chosen a queen like this. - He'll love the idea. - What man wouldn't? This isn't the Persian way. No. Would you want your daughter taken for the King's harem? As the King's subjects, they already belong to him. What does the empire lose if a few young women do their duty? This will appease the King and protect our positions in court. Where do I sign? Thanks to us, Xerxes will have a beautiful new bride. And some nobody is about to be very lucky. - Come. There's no time to waste. - Well, he won't be getting my daughter. I don't think you have anything to worry about. - I am the King. - You requested more wine, my lord. Why didn't she just come to me? Mother would have obeyed. She may not have liked it, but she would have done it. - She respected Father. - You may go. It was the princes' idea to get rid of her, not mine. They're coming to see you. Tonight? Tell them to wait in the court. She was so beautiful, Hatach. Proud, stubborn. But I thought I could trust her. You will find a queen worthy to stand at your side, Your Majesty. If she exists. Who am I that you notice me? Who am I that you care for me? You made every star tonight With a plan for every light On the threshold of something new Help me to trust in you Heavens move and seasons change So it's time I do same So with hope A little fear I will be still and know You're here I look up And know You're here - Where is she? - What is this? You can't just... Oh, good. They're not here yet. - They should be here soon. - What is going on? - Haven't you heard the latest decree? - No. There's a new decree every day. Is everything all right? Everyone thinks they can just burst into our home... Mordecai, for once just listen. By order of the King... "Let all beautiful, unmarried women throughout the empire "be brought to the King's palace." "Let them be placed in the King's harem." "Let the one who pleases the King most be made queen instead of Vashti." Long live Xerxes - No. - He made it the law, Mordecai. They are taking them whether they want to go or not. - He can't do this. - He's the king. - He can do whatever he wants. - If they see Hadassah... - Mordecai? Out. - Get out. All of you. Out. - All right. - Pack your things. We're leaving. - There isn't enough time. Then we'll hide everything that's yours. We won't let them find you. I knew this would happen. I knew one day something like this would happen. Mordecai. - We should have moved back to Jerusalem. We should have left when we had the chance. Mordecai. This godless city is no place for the people of Jehovah. - Mordecai. - Hadassah. - We need to pray. - You're right. - Is God going to let this happen? - I don't know. Why are we wasting time in this district? The King doesn't want a filthy Jew. - Get out of here. - We're just following orders. And trust me. A beautiful girl lives there. Excuse me. I think you have the wrong house. It's just a grumpy old bachelor that lives there. Quiet. See if she's in there. Oh! You startled me. I was just heading out to work. - Where is she? - I don't know what you're talking about. Where's your daughter? - I don't have a daughter. Search it. - You won't find anything. - Careful, Jew. Some of us remember the old days when your kind were still slaves. - You don't belong in this city. - And you don't belong in my home. There's nothing in here. It looks like it's just him. See? I told you. One more word and I'll have you flogged. Wait. - I found this. - I've never seen that before in my life. It's mine. The veil is mine. - No, Ruthie. Come back. - Quiet, woman. Well, well, well. Look what the dog found. - Bring her out. - Don't touch her. - You're all filthy liars. - Mordecai. How could anyone forget a face like that? Please. - Take her. No, Mordecai... - I beg you, please. - You can't do this. Mordecai. Lord, you can't let this happen. - I have to help her. - No, Mordecai. - Mordecai, you can't. - I have to do something. You'll be killed. You saw how they still treat us. The Hebrew girls don't stand a chance in there. - Then they must never know. Mordecai. Take her in. Take her in. - Wait. Not you. - Hadassah. - Hadassah, where are you? - Mordecai, I'm over here. What is the matter with you? Are you all right, Esther? - Esther... - She's over there. Go, go. - He's back. Stop him. - No. Wait. - Wait. You have no right to take... - Get out of my way. Please. Hadassah, you can't tell anyone you're a Hebrew. - Why? - It's the only way we can keep you safe. - No one can know. - But it's who I am. There are people in this world who hate us. - Promise me you won't tell anyone. - I promise. That's it. I've had enough. - You and your daughter... - She's not my daughter. - You there, what is your name? - Esther. - Her name is Esther. Esther. Hmm. She's the last one for today. Take her in. We'll begin again tomorrow. I can't... - Go. Oh, Hadassah! Remember who you are I can't believe we're here. - I heard the King is really handsome. Well, I heard he has a terrible temper. Remember what happened to Vashti? Well, she was a fool. The King needs someone who knows how to be queen. - Is that you? - They had to drag her in by her hair. - Stop crying. - What's your name? - Leah. I can't do this. I have to get out of here. Leah, no. No. No. Please. Help me. Let me go. Release her. These women are property of the King. What is this about? - I don't belong here. - Most of you don't. Why? - I'm a Hebrew. - A Jew? Well, that explains it. I don't want her anywhere near me. Silence! The gods have assured victory. The time is right, Your Majesty. The immortals are assembling and we'll be ready to leave tonight. Those rebels will mourn the day they refused to submit to me. What is this? Bow. These are the chosen young women from Susa, Your Majesty. For the contest. - More will be arriving in the weeks ahead. - Well done, Master Hegai. It looks like you have something to work with. - Don't you agree, generals? - The battle awaits, Your Majesty. I am truly looking forward to my victorious return. Come, generals. Take them to be purified, and have them dressed for the baths. - No time to waste. - Right, ladies. That way. Single file. Not the one the King noticed. - Wait here. Master Hegai, what is to be done with the Jewish girl? The King won't choose a Hebrew for a queen. Make her a handmaiden to the others. - They'll destroy her. - No. It's the best I can do. And as for you... - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. - What's your name? Hada... Esther. My name is Esther. Esther. You're named for the stars. Let's see if you continue to outshine the others. Take her. So we begin. My son, you must defend your kingdom. But pride was your father's downfall. He sought battle where there was none. The last time he left for Greece was the last time I saw him alive. - I am not my father. Remember who you are, Xerxes. Legacy Dynasty Royalty, destiny, victory Fulfill your destiny Seal your legacy Remember who we are Who you are Generations have gone before you My prideful son The crown must still be won I still see her as that small child It had been days since she had last smiled Eyes full of questions and frozen tears She knew that death Had stolen precious years But I took her In my arms to protect her To keep her safe from harm but I failed her So you must save her now Because I don't know how - Mordecai, I got your letter. - Amir, did anyone follow you? - I don't believe so. What is this about? - I need your help, Amir. There was a young woman who was taken into the palace today who doesn't belong there. What are you talking about? You're the highest official at the King's Gate. I thought maybe you could find a way to get her released. Released? Those girls are property of the King. - People are not property. - We are all subjects of the King. She doesn't belong with him. Listen. I thought you asked me here to finally accept the job at the gate. We could be arrested for even discussing it. - There is nothing you can do. - I refuse to accept that. Can you at least check on her for me? Let me know how she is. No. It's forbidden, Mordecai. Whoever she is, she belongs to the King. Just accept that and things will get easier. I don't want things to get easier. I want them to be right. I'm sorry, Mordecai. Good night. Lord, why are you allowing this? Help me, please. Who are you? I... I'm Ezra. I live upstairs. I'm sorry about what happened today. You're never here this late. But I saw that your lamp was burning and I figured that you probably haven't eaten. So I stopped by the market on the way home from the palace to get something to eat. The palace? - So, here. - Palace? I've had enough of the palace. - What? Oh... - Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Lord, there has to be a way to get to her. You need to show me. Goat cheese, lamb, challah bread? That boy's a Hebrew. Come back. Come back. Come back. Where did he... You. I need to talk to you. - Wait there. I'll come to you. A Hebrew who works in the palace right above my head the whole time. So many stairs. I should've had you come to me. - Open the door. It's Mordecai. - I know. - Let me in. - Please don't hurt me. - I just want to ask you a question. - Hey. - Oh... You work for the palace? - I don't want any trouble. - Do you work for the palace? - Yes. For the King, actually. I'm one of his scribes. The King? - Are you a Hebrew? - I'm in the tribe. Good. I need your help. When do you go back? I work every day. Except Sabbath, of course. A man of faith. That's important. I just need you to check on someone for me. Is she in the harem? - Yes. - No. She's one of us. She doesn't deserve this. It's too much of a risk. I'm sorry. "He who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it is guilty." Are you trying to use scripture... - It's written right there. - That's because I wrote it. I'm transcribing the scriptures. "He who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it is guilty." Looks good to me. - Her name is... - Esther. Her Persian name is Esther. - What does it mean? - Star. But in Hebrew, it means... - Hidden. - Ah. Yes. Oh, Lord. All right, I'll do it. - I mean I'll try. I'll try. - Oh! Thank you. I'm sorry. What did you say your name was? My name is Ezra. It means help. Thank you, Lord. We'll scrub off the past Till they're clean One future is meant for a queen Look one last time And say goodbye to who you see Say hello To what we know you're meant to be A reflection of perfection a lovely figure and complexion No objection to correction you must be Persia's own reflection Welcome to the Oasis. Over the next 12 months, I will break you down, then build you back up, like soldiers preparing for war. Now, let's see who among you is worth it. Beauty is pain beauty is strain Beauty is hurry up and wait - Be still - A lady is grace - Be still and know - A lady saves face A lady knows her place Congratulations. Those of you remaining will continue on. A scalding bath perfume for their skin Eat to sustain but don't get too thin A kiss of sun to keep them fair And do something with their nails and their hair You're not working as hard as the others. - I am doing the best I can. - And it's effortless. I'm giving you special beauty treatments of gold and myrrh and a diet of the choicest foods. You'll also be assigned personal handmaidens. Now go. - Can one of them be Leah? - The Jewish girl? You're not like the others. I'll see to it. Oh, Mordecai, you need to stop coming by the palace every day. Well, what's the latest news? She's under the charge of a man named Hegai. - Hegai? - And apparently, Esther is his favorite. - Oh, of course she is. - That's good, right? - I want to hear from her, Ezra. - What? No. You're crazy. The palace guards have the entire wing blocked off. - It'd be easier to walk to the Red Sea. - So it's possible. - Argh! - Go. Go, go, go. A connection, good impression will be the key to your election Your projection, his perception must be Persia's own reflection In six months, look at what you've become. Moving forward, you should reflect your new identity. Choose wisely. How to make him see me? Bow with your knees - Be still Stand out from the crowd Always say please - Be still and know - Eyes down, chin up - Be the last thing that he sees Be quiet, never loud - It's not a time for weakness A queen is true - No more tears to shed It could be you Could I really wear the crown upon my head? If you're Persia through and through Take them. Why did you choose a veil? This reminded me of home. - You miss your home, don't you? - Very much. I will allow you to send one message home. Master Hegai, it isn't allowed. She may not have chosen a crown, but a crown just might choose her. Shaashgaz, summon a trustworthy scribe. Mordecai. Mordecai, you're not gonna believe this. I have a letter and it's from her. It's from her. The time is now An obsession with progression will surely keep you from rejection To show you how With each section and inspection we steered you in the right direction We broke you down A connection, good impression will be the key to your election To wear the crown Your projection, his perception you must be Persia's own reflection My dear Mordecai, I miss you. I present Caspara, keeper of treasure. I am praying the Lord will bring us back together. Adrina, the burning flame. I am safe, and so is our secret. Anya, full of grace. I remember what you taught me. Avaley, a lovely songbird. That God knows the plans he has for us. Pari, playful spirit. Plans for a hope and a future. Yasmin, the seductive flower. I love you, Mordecai. And Esther. I remember who I am. My rising star. Your Hadassah. Oh, my dear girl. Thank you, Lord. It is time. You are ready for His Majesty. I can hear them cheering - A picture of royalty - He will love what he sees - Daughter of this country - It's all been for this moment - A queen is born, not trained You are who And where you're meant to be What is this about? - The King is returning. - What? The Spartans are stronger than we assumed. We're losing the war. How is he taking it? How do you think? He's executed his generals. He whipped the sea when his fleet sank, and he burned the city of Athens to the ground. So, not well. - He's going mad. - And he'll be coming to us for answers. We need to turn the tide back in our favor. We need someone that the King will listen to. - Send for Governor Haman. - Governor Haman? But... He's the wealthiest and most powerful governor in the empire. And there's a reason for that. What if he comes with a cost? Our lives are at stake. It's a risk worth taking. Gather the others. Mordecai. Where are you going at this hour? - To the gate, if you must know. - Why? Surely they're closed. I'm getting a job at the gate. - You're going to work for the King? - It's the only way I can be near her. - He's returning. - Oh, no. Hadassah. He's losing the war, and that tyrant will be more dangerous than ever. And my Hadassah will be led to him like a lamb to the slaughter. Why is the Lord allowing all of this to happen? - I ask him that same question every day. But I can't sit by and do nothing. I'm afraid for her, Abigail. I need to speak with Amir right away. Unorganized barbarians. A small collection of states that fight among themselves. An easy opponent. You were wrong. The Greeks were ready for us. - I'm sorry that the generals... - The generals have been dealt with. - But what do I do with you? - Your Majesty... Did I extend my scepter to you? You made me look like a fool. Sit. So, counsel me, princes of Persia. - How do I restore the dignity of my reign? - Raise taxes. - That usually works. - Quiet. If it pleases the King, we have sent for one of the most successful governors among the provinces. His territory is thriving. He's strong, cunning and his pockets run deep with gold. You have my attention. He was once a trusted advisor of your father's. - Really? What's his name? - Governor Haman. Bring him to me. And I don't need to remind you how high the stakes are, Memucan. And now, perhaps a bit of distraction. Master Hegai has been preparing the choicest young ladies of the empire for you. I almost forgot. Hatach, tell Master Hegai to bring the most promising candidate. For all our sakes. Lady Esther? The indigo dye for your nails is ready. - Thank you, Leah. - She gets everything. Well, Master Hegai knows Esther needs all the help she can get. Esther, aren't you going to defend yourself? Oh, she won't. She never disagrees. You know, it may work for Hegai, but it won't appeal to the King. There's plenty of dye. I could share it with all of you. - No, no, no. No. It's all yours. Hmm. Go ahead. Jew, paint Lady Esther's nails. Look at what you did. You fool. - You pushed me. Silence. No. It will take weeks to remove this from your skin. - Who's responsible? - The Jewish girl did it. They can't be trusted with anything. I don't believe she's the one who can't be trusted. The King has returned. We begin the process tonight. You will each choose an item to take with you. Something to help him remember you. Yasmin, make your selection. - I'm going now? - Yes. And unfortunately for you, the King is not in the best of spirits. Very well. - That belongs to Esther. - She won't be needing it. In fact, the King won't be meeting any of you. The rest of you, prepare yourselves. I have a feeling you will be meeting the King. Leah, would you please see to our Esther? I'll wait I'll wait on you I'll hope I'll hope in you From the depths I cry to you You are, you are my light I'll walk by faith and not by sight Why does it feel so dark tonight? I can't help but question Could this be your intention? But I'll listen And wait I'll wait So with hope And with fear I'll be still and know Chariots, horses, wine skins? Peacock feathers? I hate this. I hate this. I'm here to be close to Hadassah, and I haven't seen or heard a single word. I can't take it anymore. Lord, I'm going. Unless you tell me you need me and I cannot leave, I'm done. Mordecai, I need you. You cannot leave. Amir, there's nothing more I can do. Between this disaster of a war and the King's spending, this empire's facing financial ruin. Not for long. He's called for one of the wealthiest governors to come help assess the situation. A lot of good that'll do. Mordecai, we keep our opinions to ourselves. Besides, the King has other things on his mind. I heard Master Hegai is sending his most promising candidate to the King this evening. Amir, I'm not interested in... Wait. What did you say? - The girls for the contest. - What's her name? Her name? I have no idea. But Hegai calls her his rising star. Perfect timing. Tonight is the festival of lights, after all. Give me that ledger, Amir. I'll have it ready for you first thing in the morning. - But I thought tomorrow was your Sabbath. - First of the week then. - Good night, Amir. - Good night. Hadassah. My Hadassah. Well, the wait was worth it. What did you choose to take with you? Nothing yet. I wanted to ask you first. You're the only one who has. A harp? It's beautiful. Thank you. I think you have everything you need. I'm scared. It's the darkest night of the year. I can't think of a better time for my star to rise. You may enter. There is another threat to my crown. Rebellions are everywhere. And you and Teresh, my most trusted bodyguards, have done nothing to eliminate the threat. If you would just listen to the generals... What did you say? - If you would just... - Your safety is our top priority, my king. You can trust us. Stand outside my door tonight. I need to be alone. Bigthan. Teresh. Tell Hatach to bring more wine. Another one. What do you have to say for yourself? - Speak. - I can leave if you wish. You're already here. What are you hiding? Remove your veil so I can see you. Hmm. You're beautiful. And different from the others. They like to make themselves known. Well, I would offer you some wine, but there is no wine in my chamber. - I've sent for Hatach, Your Majesty. - I am surrounded by fools. And all I want is some peace. Who taught you to play? My father. He could do anything. So could mine. The city looks beautiful under the starlight. I've always loved the stars. Come. Take a look. - It's a perfect night for the festival. - Are those the gardens? Yes. My father took great pride in his gardens, but they've been neglected ever since he died. My mother loved to garden. She died when I was very young. - It's not easy feeling alone, is it? - No, it isn't. But that's why I love the stars. They remind me that we're never alone. Huh. Then maybe we should get a better view. - I would have picked the first one. - Why can't he just choose one? We all know Xerxes can't make a good decision. He treats us like handmaids while he keeps running our country into the dust. Maybe he won't for much longer. I have a plan. Ha! How did I almost forget? Open sky, softly lit Just a taste of being free Is the sweetest gift to me I feel you I know you're here How did I almost forget? Kings are strong, confident A taste of who I used to be Is life coming back to me? I feel it I know it's near Underneath the starlight Anything's possible Everything's beautiful Hope is dawning tonight A new start In my heart At the threshold of something new Light is breaking Light is breaking through Underneath the starlight Anything's possible Everything's beautiful Hope is dawning tonight A new start Master Hegai, prepare the crown. I have made my choice. It is time for a royal celebration. And so it was, in the tenth year of his reign, King Xerxes placed the royal crown on my head. I give you Queen Esther. King Xerxes invited the greatest nobles from the farthest reaches of Persia to attend. He relieved taxes and gave gifts with royal generosity. The Lord had set everything in place. The renowned satrap of Sidon, head of the house of Hammedatha. Lord Governor Haman and his wife, Lady Zeresh. Governor Haman, I've been expecting you. I present your queen, Esther. I trust that you will serve me as well as you served my father. Trust me when I say we stand at the threshold of a greater Persia. A snake had entered the garden. What are we doing here? The King gave Hadassah this garden as a wedding gift. Some gift. I really don't think we should be here. The Queen of Persia. Why is the Lord allowing this? How will she ever survive it? She's stronger than you think. She's kept her most important secret so far. - Yes, but if the King ever finds out... - Can we talk about this somewhere else? Out here. Oh, no. - We'll be alone. Mordecai, let's get out of here. Does it have to be tonight? We promised. - It can't wait any longer. - All right. I just thought that maybe... - What was that? - Nothing. No one comes to these gardens anymore. Calm down, Bigthan. It's not every day we kill the King, Teresh. You kill the King. I stand guard as usual. - Why does it have to be me? - Because the lot fell to you. We've been through this before. The poisoned dagger is behind the bed, near the window. Now, let's get this over with. We have to do it - I can't do it We've already been paid so get to it When he goes to bed think of what they said We're better off if he's dead Can't ignore anymore went back on what he swore Lost the war and what for? - Now he's married a common... Can this be true? We can do it we have to do it We've already been paid - So get to it - What can I do? When he goes to bed think of what they said We're better off if he's dead - Take the knife - Take his life And if she's there Kill his wife - Let's go. - No, no, no. Lord, I have to do something. Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you know what time it is? Who are you and what are you doing out here? - I need to see the Queen. - You can't see the Queen. Even I can't see the Queen. Now, quiet down and leave or I'll call the palace guards. Yes. No. Not the palace guards. Oh, who were those men? I suggest you leave while I give you the chance. - Master Hegai, what is going on out here? - Master Hegai? - Hegai, the star is in trouble. - The star? What is this about? I just overheard two men plotting to kill the King and possibly his wife. - My Esther. - My Esther. How did you know her? Well, let's just say I once received a letter from the harem. Go on. These two men are planning to murder Xerxes tonight. It's two men who are very close to him. - Who? - I can't remember. What do you mean, you can't remember? Well, these Persian names are very confusing. - Can you remember anything? - Oh, Lord, you have to help me. It started with... A bird? Bird. B. B. Bigthan. - Bigthan and Teresh? - Yes. They're the King's bodyguards. They're the King's assassins. We need to tell Esther. We can't. But I know someone who can. Shaashgaz, get the Jewish girl, Leah. And keep this between us. Now, tell me again from the beginning. They have to do it they're gonna do it They've already been paid to get to it When he goes to bed this what they said We're better off if he's dead Take a knife take his life And if she's there, kill his wife - Are you sure? - Yes. Hegai sent me here immediately. And Mordecai? Is he safe? - The man from the gate? Yes. - Oh, good. - I have to warn my husband. - No. No, you can't. You could be killed if you go in there unsummoned. He'll be killed if I don't. See if Bigthan and Teresh are on the loggia. I'll go with you. Your Highness. What are you doing out of your chamber at this hour? - I need to see the King. - You can't see the King. Even I can't see the King unless he summons me. - They're coming. - Who? Come to my chamber. We're better off if he's dead - If you're right - Then they might We have to move tonight We need to get word to someone who can see the King. Lord Haman. The King has been meeting with him every night. - Can we trust him? - Can we afford not to? I'll distract Teresh. You get word to Lord Haman. Teresh. Teresh. It's such an unusually dark night. Would you kindly see me back to my chamber? - It will only take a moment. - Of course, Your Highness. Where's the King? Is it too late? Teresh. Teresh. Teresh, the King is not here. We have to find him. King Xerxes. Your Majesty. Master Hegai? Lord Haman? What's going on here? - Who are you? - I'm Mordecai. I work at the gate. Your Majesty, I'm here on behalf of the Queen. - The Queen? - She sent for me to protect you. Protect me? She has a message for you, if you will allow her to give it. Esther? If it pleases the King This man named Mordecai The worker from your gate As he was passing by He heard them plan your fate There's a knife they keep underneath your bed While you were asleep, they were... If it weren't for Mordecai, you'd be dead - What are their names? - Bigthan and Teresh. You liar. - What? Guards, seize them. - My closest defenders. She's lying. - The Queen is lying. - Teresh. I found this under your bed, my son. It's laced with poison. I've never seen that before in my life. You traitors. You dare betray your king? I trusted you I gave you everything Scribes. It fills me with disgust You shouldn't have to question who to trust Take this down. Mordecai told my wife write down he saved my life Haman, too I trust you I will reward those who are Faithful, loyal, grateful Take them to the gallows. It's time for things to change In Persia We stand at the dawn of a new day in Persia, a day that demands loyalty. To ensure the success of my reign, one man will stand by my side. Your first imperial prime minister, Grand Vizier Haman, the Agagite. No! An Agagite? An Agagite? Lord, this can't be. This can't be happening. Have you heard the latest news? Well, look who it is, back from the palace. Ezra needs to hear this. - Hear what? - What I'm about to tell you. - Oh, ho. Hey. - Ezra. - What is going on? Governor Haman has been promoted. - But you're the one who saved the King. - Who's Governor Haman? He is our new prime minister. - Prime minister? - And he's an Agagite. An Agagite? Xerxes will only have one man giving him counsel. - And that man is a self-declared... - Agagite. - The prime minister is an... Agagite. We know. He could have said he was from the west, an Amalekite even. But he wants to be known as an Agagite. A direct descendant of the enemies of God. No Persian king would allow anything to happen to us. Cyrus freed the Jews. Xerxes' father helped to rebuild Jerusalem. Is there reason for concern? Haman is only an adviser. - He's his only adviser. - I just came from the palace. Haman has ordered that anyone who works for the empire must bow in his presence. - He wants to be king. - He wants to be worshipped. - The King agreed? - Yes. Mordecai, that means you're going to have to... Bow. - We worship the Lord alone. Now, it's not worth causing trouble. - You just need to keep your head down. - From evil men come evil deeds. It's best to obey the law. You're creating danger that isn't even there. I won't let it happen again. Generation to generation The echo rings Our history of blood and kings We turned our back on the Lord Even after he set us free and parted the sea Through miles of sand and sun He showed us who to be so the world could see He taught us how to pierce the dark and shine But soon enough the enemy came from behind They stole and they murdered who they could find The Amalekites promised God's people safe passage through their land. But they broke that promise. They attacked from behind, killing women, children, the sick and the old. The weakest of God's people. The Lord said... I will wipe out the Amalekites from under heaven. Time passed the people wanted a king The Lord sounded a call to a man named Saul He was meant to rule with light but he let the shadows fall He lost it all He feared men but he didn't fear the Lord He loved the things of this world and lived by the sword The cost was greater than we could afford After generations of brutal attacks, the Lord commanded King Saul... Go. Attack the Amalekites. Destroy everyone and everything owned by them. But Saul disobeyed. He kept the best of what they had. And he kept their king, Agag, alive. The spirit of the Lord left Saul that day, and he was tortured in his spirit till his dying day. The descendants of Agag are the Agagites. Haman is descended from King Agag. I am descended from King Saul. The blood of kings flows through our veins, and the Lord has allowed this ancient enemy to rise again. Make no mistake, God has a plan. There is an enemy, and we have a choice. A choice we must make to obey Flows through time until it makes a way So I will stand for what is right God still says let there be light A new day A new way The rules have changed, rearranged but we still have to play A new time A new crime The price is high say goodbye to what's left of your pride A choice we must make to bend or break It's all at stake will you bend or break? - We are certain - Someone will not bend - What will happen? - The fool could meet his end Who is it? He's not even Persian Mordecai? Nowhere to run he is done But it's only begun The shadow - We all must sacrifice Of the gallows - I don't have a price If you refuse you will lose This is no time to choose You must bow to him. A choice we must make to bend or break It's all at stake will you bend or break? The Lord is with me I will not be afraid - He will guide me on my way - A choice we must make He is for me I will choose this day It is him I will obey It's not too late to compromise one would even call it wise No room for defiance make the right alliance Mordecai, you're going to get us all in trouble. Why won't you just bow to him? - I won't. - Why? - Because... - Why? - Because I'm a Jew. - Tell Haman. A secret is worth its weight in gold Crowded shadows can be sold We all stand to profit by filling Haman's pocket Susa never felt so cold Mordecai, what are you doing? This is only the beginning Compromise is just like sinning In the end, you won't be winning Now is the time to bow don't think about how, just bow Bend the knee don't ask questions It could be too hard a lesson bow, bow, bow - You only stand to lose - I will not be afraid If you refuse You only stand to lose if you refuse Bow So, it's because you're a Jew. And you're an Agagite. Yes. It's important to remember who we are. Bow to me. It's the law. I worship the Lord alone. Come, princes. I have never seen such insubordination, such... - Obstinance. - It was bold. - It was brazen. - It was dangerous. Mordecai. Mordecai. Mordecai. Zeresh. - Yes, my love. - Bring the lots. - As you wish. My husband, what are you doing? - He will be punished. - Absolutely. The King will not deny Mordecai's execution. Mordecai alone isn't enough. Other Jews will follow his example. They must be dealt with. Are you suggesting that we kill all Jews? - But, Grand Vizier... - Zeresh, the dice. - What are they for? - I know what I'm going to do. - I just need to know when. - The King will never agree to this. Xerxes is like clay in my hands. But Persian kings have always supported them. Then he must never know it is the Jews. Now, stand with me or meet the same fate as those dogs. Do it. He may be prepared to die But it's not only his life that I demand Roll the dice Royal blood flows through my veins Their blood will flow and rain at my command Roll the dice - For the month, for the day - It's time those Hebrews pay - For the month, for the day - For generations of decay Roll the dice - I try to follow you with each step - Roll the dice I try to keep my eyes straight ahead But I wonder am I willing to die? God, why? Roll the dice O Lord, I bless your name Your promises remain Creator, our savior... Please light my - Lady Atossa. - Have you seen my son? No. He hasn't summoned me in weeks. He only sees Grand Vizier Haman. - He's even forgotten you. - Is something wrong? The King of Persia needs more than a single counselor. If his father could see him now, well... - I'm sorry for disturbing you. - I wish there was something I could do. So do I. But keep praying. Perhaps your God will help. The gods have spoken. The time they choose is the 13th of Adar. On the 13th of Adar they'll run but won't get far - On the 13th of Adar - None shall be spared On the 13th of Adar I will wipe them out and blot their name From under every star You placed every star tonight With a plan for every light Why does it feel so dark tonight? Who can stand against me? I have come to steal, kill and destroy Avenge my legacy On that day, they will pay Let darkness guide me on my way Grand Vizier Haman. - I understand you wanted to see me. Your Majesty. Welcome to the Hall of Chronicles. My father built this library to hold our records. Everything that happens in this empire is recorded and secured within these walls. It's a place to remind kings of our history. Yes, it's important to remember our history. So, more good news, Haman? I look forward to your reports. Unfortunately, there is a problem rising in the empire. A problem? I have everything in place to take care of it. - I just need your approval. - What is it? A possible rebellion. Go on. There's a people throughout your land They follow their own commands They don't obey the King They can't do this. They spread like a disease hoard their gold as they please Think of the trouble they could bring They will pay for this. They say they're set apart But there's rebellion in their hearts I'm afraid we must do something Who are they? Does it matter? Mercy could be seen as weakness While they live, you should be sleepless All I need is your ring How many are there? - Thousands. - Thousands? - What will it cost? - Nothing. I will pay 10.000 pieces of silver into the treasury if you will allow me to take care of this for you. I know they've overthrown kings in the past. You take this ring and use it to destroy them. Whatever you seal with this cannot be changed. - I trust you, Haman. - I will take care of everything. Generation to generation The echo rings Our history of blood And kings By order of the Grand Vizier... Hear this. On the 13th day of the month of Adar... All Jews throughout the Persian Empire... Young, old, women and children... Are sentenced to death. - Sealed by His Royal Majesty... Xerxes, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. No! - Mordecai, what do we do? - We cover ourselves in sackcloth and ash. We humble ourselves before the Lord our God. Yes, ashes bring life. Oh, Lord, you led our people through oceans. You made giants fall. You shut the mouth of the roaring lions. Shut your mouth, Mordecai, before you make things worse. Make a way to save us from the enemy again. Forgive us, Lord. Save us. Mordecai, I just came from the palace. Haman is behind it all. Of course he is. He's finishing what his ancestors started. He offered the King 750.000 pounds of silver so it can happen. That's a year's worth of income for the empire. He's bought us, paid to have us killed. That's not all. The citizens of Persia are called to carry out the murders. They're marking every Hebrew home throughout the empire, and anyone who kills a Jew gets to keep our possessions. - Greed will win them over. - He's turning the world against us. But the Persian kings, they've always protected us. - Why is the King allowing this to happen? - Haman never told Xerxes it was us. What? What do you mean? Haman never told Xerxes it was the Jews he wanted to kill. Someone has to tell him. Someone has to go to the King and... - None of us can see the King. - It doesn't matter. Xerxes won't change his mind. He has nothing to lose. Lord, make a way. - Are you Mordecai from the gate? - I am. My name is Hatach. I have been sent by the Queen. - The Queen? Hadassah. She is concerned for your safety. She wants you to remove your sackcloth and wear this. I won't. And what should I tell her is the reason for all of this? - She doesn't know? - Mordecai, she could be the way. No. Mordecai, she could go to the King and plead for our lives. I don't want her in danger. If the King finds out his wife is one of us... She was never supposed to be there in the first place. Mordecai, what if she was meant to be there all along? Haman the Agagite the one who holds the ring Plotted late last night Now it's law sealed by the King The young and the old the near and the far Every Jew in the empire will be killed Hadassah. Tell him who you are He asked that you go to the King and plead for the lives of your people. - Your people? I can't. Xerxes hasn't called for me in 30 days. He doesn't love me like he used to. Your Highness, if you approach the King without being summoned and he does not extend his scepter to you... I'll be killed. This Mordecai does not know what he is asking. He does. Oh, Mordecai. Hadassah. All I ever wanted was to keep you safe. I did the best that I could. But you have always been in the Lord's hands. Deliverance will come for God's people. God has a plan. There is an enemy. And right now you have a choice. Who knows? Perhaps you were made queen for such a time as this. Generation to generation The call is high If I die, I die Will you ask our people to fast and pray to the Lord for three days? My servants and I will do the same. Then I will go to the King. Hadassah, be still and know. He is God. Your word is a lamp unto my feet Your word is a light unto my path I'll walk in your ways for all of my days Though I may not have many left Your word is like sweetness in my mouth Your word is like honey on my lips I still taste your goodness long for your presence Let me rest in your midst Our eyes are open Our hearts are broken Take these ashes fan them into flame Forgive us, Father Your sons and daughters We're fighting doubt and crying out your name Your word is a lamp unto my feet Your word is a light unto my path I'll walk in your ways for all of my days Though I may not have many left A choice we must make to obey Generation Flows through time Until it makes a way - Our hearts are burning - Your word is a lamp - We are returning - Your word is a light To your will try to be still in all things - You have the power - I'll follow your ways - In this dark hour - For all of my days You are the King of Kings So help her stand For what is right God still says let there be light Be still Be still Be still Be still Be still and... No. What is this? I have a request. - She was not summoned. My king. My life is in your hands. Guards. Princes. Bow to your queen. Esther, what is your request? I would give you anything, even up to half of my kingdom. Will you and Grand Vizier Haman come to a banquet I've prepared today? A banquet? That's what you risked your life to ask for? - Yes. I have something I need to ask you. - My Esther, you are full of surprises. Hatach, summon Grand Vizier Haman. We have a feast to attend. Leah. Hegai. If it pleases the King, and if I have found favor in your sight, please grant me my life and spare my people. Grant me my life, spare my people. And by the way, the person you trust the most in the entire world is behind it all. - It's going to be fine. - Don't forget this. Thank you. Your Majesty. Grand Vizier Haman. - I am so grateful... Your Highness. It's an honor to be invited to this charming, intimate feast. What is the occasion? My queen risked her life to ask us here today. She has a request. What could a beautiful young queen living in the shadow of your greatness possibly need? I would give her anything. Up to half my kingdom. - Really? - Go on, Esther. Make your request. Please, sit. I thought we could begin with some of your favorites. Now... - If it pleases the King... - Esther, will you play something for us? She played for me the first night we met, Haman. That was when you captured my heart, Esther. - Your Majesty, I... - You play well, Your Highness. But how about something more lively? Hatach, add some musicians. - Your Majesty... Now, isn't that better? I wanted to ask you if... This is what I need both of you at my side - Your friend in word and deed - My bride - It's time to celebrate - I feel relief in sight No need to moderate tonight What is your request? My request If it pleases the King I think he'll have another drink. Pomegranate walnut stew eggplant and tomato, too Our kitchens only serve the best herring with some lemon zest Lamb with fenugreek and thyme roasted with a hint of lime And of course the wine More wine - There's something else we need - What did we have that time? Was it a leg of steed? Sublime - Are there dancers here? - None that I've prepared It always brings him cheer You there. Thank you for the invitation Well, you are prime minister of this nation - I'm here to serve the King - So am I, his queen We can work for him together Your Majesty This is my request Another bottle. Serve the best. Women for your every taste dance and sway with covered face Guitars, sitars, tambourines it's a feast fit for a queen Nothing Persian is as fine ages beautifully with time As, of course, the wine More wine. More wine Entertainment is our skill Every need will be fulfilled here we cannot... Be still. Your Majesty. My request if it pleases the King... - Oh! Hatach, tend to His Majesty. See that he gets back to his chamber. What? Wait. Wait. Esther, what was your request? Um... Will you come to another banquet I've prepared tomorrow? The both of you. Then I will make my request. Your Highness. Perhaps it would be better if you made your requests known to me. Is there anything I can do for you? You've done enough. But please, it is very important to me that you are here tomorrow. It will be my honor, Your Highness. Get up and bow, you dog. So be it. Come, princes. She didn't do it. She failed us. She failed us all. - You don't know that. - It's over, Mordecai. - She broke her word. - No. Not my Hadassah. - Something must have gone wrong. - What do we do? We keep praying. I didn't do it I tried to do it There was no time, and I knew it everything was planned I don't understand And now they're coming back for another feast tomorrow. - What will you do differently tomorrow? - I don't know. Was I wrong? Just stay strong you're right where you belong I wear the King's ring. My pockets overflow with wealth and so does my household. I have 10 sons and all of it means nothing while that arrogant Jew lives. He's one man, Haman. You're letting this Mordecai... Don't mention that name again. I want it wiped from the face of the earth. - He'll be dead in a few months. - Why can't you just kill him now, Father? Yes, Father. We can build our own gallows. - Hang him on it for everyone to see. - You can make an example of him. Your son is right. You have the favor of the King. You could go to him now and ask for the death of... That Jew tonight. The gods have already selected the proper time. - Don't test them, Haman. - I don't fear the gods, Zeresh. The stars are painting an uncertain picture of the future. - Enough! Why can't you be more like the Queen? She knows how to keep quiet. If I kept quiet, you wouldn't be where you are. - Do what you will. - Aridai, gather your brothers. You're going to build a gallows tonight. Raise it high. Make sure I can see it from my window. First thing tomorrow morning, I will go to Xerxes and ask for the death of Mordecai. Is it unraveling? the life we've built The web we've spun the blood we've spilt It's not a time for weakness no more tears to shed I may not have her sweetness but I'll take strength instead I pray to the lights For power and vision I pray to the night To unveil what's hidden We're running out of time Give me a sign We've spent so many years behind these walls She held my hand through every fall I always lived like you were something from the past But she reminds me that our faith was built to last Look at the stars they remind us to be still You seem so far draw her closer to your will You know their names you know their number in the sky Each one in place O Lord, please lift up her eyes We're running out of time give her a sign I have done everything to raise and guide this king No price I didn't pay but he has lost his way I can't be what he needs Someone must intercede something must be done If you're listening Save my son Look at the stars they remind us to be still You seem so far draw her closer to your will You know their names you know their number in the sky Each one in place O Lord, please lift up her eyes He's running out of time We're running out of time - Give me a... Give her a... Give him a sign Guards! Guards! Guards! - What is it? - What's going on? - They're trying to kill me. - Who? Bigthan, Teresh. Your Majesty, Bigthan and Teresh were executed years ago. - No, no. - They were hung on the gallows. It was ordered by you and recorded in the royal chronicles. - You were dreaming. - What? - Shall I send for some wine? - No. No, Hatach. No. I want to see it. - What? Bring me the chronicles from that night. Go! Lord, what do I do? I feel so alone. Little Hadassah come sit at the wheel See how I shape the vessel touch and feel Work with what you can when it resists your hands Your heart is like clay that God loves very much You're so beautiful, Hadassah Make sure it bends and molds beneath his touch You must be brave, my darling He always has a plan You can trust his hand Stay planted In his love And you will grow in sunshine and snow Be still and know he is God And you are his I still hear your voices echo in my heart What I wouldn't give to go back to the start You told me to be brave But praying didn't save you My God I can't hear you My God I can't see you I'm tired of feeling alone I just want to go back home Hadassah, it's time. But where you lead I'll go It is recorded that the poison dagger was found in the King's chamber for the purpose of assassinating King Xerxes. Bigthan and Teresh were found to be the guilty parties. Yes, yes. This is what I was looking for. Haman discovered their plot. No, Your Majesty. It says here the plot was discovered by Mordecai. Mordecai? Who is Mordecai? Mordecai who works at the palace gate, Your Majesty. Haman assisted the Queen in delivering the news and was promoted to grand vizier. The guilty parties were then hung on the gallows. What about this Mordecai? What was done for him? Nothing. I suppose he went back to work at the gate. Nothing? The man saved my life and I gave him nothing. Loyalty must be rewarded. I need to fix this now. Your Majesty, there's a request to see you in the outer court. - Who is it? - Grand Vizier Haman. Oh, Haman. Perfect. He'll know what to do. If it pleases the King, and if I have found favor in your sight, there is a man named Mordecai who is disloyal and traitorous to the empire. And who I'd like to, with your permission... Grand Vizier Haman, you are just the man I wanted to see. Your Majesty. If it pleases the King... What should be done for a man that pleases the King? What? A man who the King would delight to honor. A man that has saved this empire and preserved my throne. Your Majesty, I'm humbled by the sentiment... It should be bold. - You've already been so generous... - Extravagant. You've already bestowed the highest honor... He should be treated with the respect he deserves, with the respect of the throne itself. Grand Vizier, what should be done for this man? Well, he could be dressed in one of your robes, and wear one of your crowns and be placed on your own horse. And then he could be paraded throughout the city by your highest official, proclaiming, "This is what is done for the man that the King delights to honor." Yes. Oh, this is a good gift. It's the best gift I could possibly give. - Yes. Yes, it is. Then it's settled. Go and do all of this for Mordecai at the gate. What? While you, Grand Vizier Haman, will carry this out to the entire city. Don't you miss a single street. Uh... - What? Thank you, Haman. You always have the best ideas. Oh, was there something you wanted to ask me? - What? - Another time then. Yes, Your Majesty. We can't believe what we are seeing Are we dreaming? What's the meaning of this display? This is what is done for the man who pleases the King. We can't believe what we are hearing No one cheering or jeering we don't know what to say It's turning the tide Beginning with this ride He cheated and lied That snake tried to get ahead but now he is behind - Everything is ready. - Did you get the challah bread? - Yes. And the lamb. - Good. - Oh, what about the lanterns? - They're in place. The garden looks beautiful. Thank you. Remember, you and Hatach are allowed. And only the most trusted servants. Will you send for Hegai? He's on his way now. - Thank you, Leah. - Queen Esther, is that Haman? Is that Mordecai? Reversal of men Controversial he didn't break or bend Flipped on his head We can't help but wonder who is gonna end up dead The higher the stakes The risk grows with each step you take He may have felt tall - Everybody knows that pride - Everybody knows that pride Everybody knows that pride comes before the fall That was a sign. A sign that the Lord is still with us. We need to keep going. Queen Esther, you made a lovely selection. You will look radiant in this color. Thank you, Hegai. You were an excellent teacher. I just want it all to be perfect. Your Highness, if I may... It isn't perfection that gives you favor with the King. It's... It's a strength that comes from deep within you. I know I'm never alone, Hegai. "Do not fear, for I am with you. Do not be discouraged. I am your God." I will strengthen you and help you. What kind of God does that for his people? The kind that loves us enough to save us. He was wearing the King's robes, being paraded around the city on the King's horse. As a man who most pleases... I was there, wasn't I? It changes nothing. It's a bad omen. A sign from his god. - Don't mention his god, Zeresh. - You're making a grave mistake. I've been learning more, and the Hebrew God is unlike anything I have ever seen. He showed Mordecai that he is with him, that he is with all of his people, and you have already begun to fall. - Zeresh. - Grand Vizier. - What? - The Queen requests your presence. Oh, yes. The Queen. When I return home, everything will continue as before. Those people will be destroyed and their god will be forgotten. This is unbelievable. This garden hasn't looked this good since my father died. In fact, it's never looked this good. Your Majesty. Grand Vizier Haman. - I'm glad you could join us. - Thank you, Your Highness. Your Majesty, may I speak with you about... Oh, this color is magnificent. What do you call this tree? The hadass tree. They grow all over the western territory. - My mother grew one here in Susa. - Your Majesty. - Magnificent. Don't you agree, Haman? - Yes, yes. It's very pink. - Your Majesty, the man from the gate... - Prime Minister, may I offer you a drink? Yes. Yes, of course, Your Highness. - Thank you. - Oh, this smells wonderful. I've never seen food like this. You are full of surprises, my queen. Your Majesty, the man from the gate that you honored this morning... - Oh! Mordecai? Yes. Him. - I have a request regarding... - More wine, Grand Vizier? - No. No, thank you. - Oh, oh. Let me help you with that. - Don't touch me. - My apologies. Speaking of requests, what is yours, Esther? I already told you I would give you anything. Up to half my kingdom. Now, as I was saying, this man from the gate... I do have a request, Your Majesty, and I will make it now. Good. Go on, Esther. If I have found favor in your sight, and if it pleases you, my request is for my life. You already have your life. My request is for my life and the lives of my people. I don't understand. We have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated. - Oh, no. Go on. If we were merely sold as slaves, I wouldn't have brought this to you. But there would still be hope for my people. - But we are all to be killed. - Who would threaten my wife? Who would dare do such a thing? - Oh, no. - Who? A foe and an enemy. This wicked man. - Oh, no. - Haman. - What? What? - I didn't know. Please, please, Your Majesty, if I had only known...

Please. Please, Your Majesty, if I had only known... - I need to be alone. - I was trying to protect you. That man from the gate refused to bow. But to you. Not the King. - He's a dangerous radical. - That dangerous radical raised me. Oh... You are full of surprises. Do you realize what you've done? You and your little secret have compromised everything the King has worked for. And he doesn't deal well with lies. I want you to leave. Now. - No. - I am your queen. You are a Jew. And the law says that you are to be killed, and nothing can change that. But if you help me regain favor in his sight, I will make sure you are spared. - I am the Lord's and he will defend me. - So beautiful. It's a shame you ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Plead on my behalf, and we will both be saved. Let me go. Take your hands off my queen. I trusted you. I gave you everything Guards. So this is who you are A traitor, liar, snake return my ring Take him now I was only trying to eliminate the threat. Do you know what you've done? My grandfather freed the Hebrews from slavery, and now it's my hand that signs for their deaths and the death of my queen. I can take care of everything. - No. - You need me. I see the game you're playing You have undone everything I've built You've been betraying Legacy, dynasty Royalty, destiny, honesty I will take your advice one last time and remove the threat permanently. - What should we do with him? Your Majesty, if I may... He instructed And constructed A stake raised high for Mordecai the man who saved your life Mordecai? Impale Haman on it. You always wanted to be raised up. Well, now is your time. Go. Be still Be still Be still and know What have I done? The decree is law. Esther, I am so sorry. We'll find a way. My God always makes a way. Hope is dawning tonight Anything's possible Anything's possible Apparently, he didn't see The writing on the wall But everybody knows that pride everybody knows that pride Everybody knows that pride comes before the fall Presenting the new grand vizier of Persia, Mordecai, the Hebrew. By the authority of the King, I issue the following decree. On the 13th day of Adar, in every province, in every city throughout this empire, all Hebrew people are granted the right to protect themselves from anyone who comes against them. From this day forward, they are permitted to do whatever is necessary to ready themselves, to stand united against their enemies. Let this time of mourning and fasting turn to celebration and feasting. There will be deliverance for God's people. Long live King Xerxes and long live Queen Esther. Darkness whispers You are far from home on your own There's a promise ringing in our bones We're not alone The stars won't be swept away tonight Be still and know He is God He is on the throne He's always here He always was We are not alone They came for me I was torn away Lost my name light was fading Then he fanned the flame He called my name Will you choose to run or stand and fight? We've seen giants fall Lions sleep We've walked through oceans He's always here He always was we are not alone The enemy is closing in but God won't let this story end We were born with purpose for such a time as this The world was meant to see us shine He placed us in the night Let there be light There is a name Stronger still Than death or pain Yahweh Yahweh, Yahweh Yahweh Yahweh, Yahweh Yahweh - Yahweh - Yahweh Yahweh Yahweh Be still and know He is God You are not alone - It is finished. - He delivered us, Hadassah. Ezra, take this down. By the authority of the King and Queen of Persia. A letter was drafted by Mordecai and sent to all of God's people throughout the empire. They were to celebrate, to hold feasts and give gifts to tell this story from generation to generation. So God's people will always remember that he has a plan. And his plan shines through us, through you, as a light to the world. A choice we must make to obey Flows through time Until it makes a way So we will stand For what is right God still says let there be light Light Light Light When I look back, I see his hand in every detail, carefully shaping every moment. God had a plan for me all along. Be still. Know that he is God. And in your story, you'll discover that he made you who you are for such a time as this.
