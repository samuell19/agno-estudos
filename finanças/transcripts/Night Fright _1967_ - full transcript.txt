(contemplative music) (crickets chirping) - Heavens, I just realized where we are. Satan's Hollow, why did we come way out here to park? - Just to be alone. - [Mary] Silly, I know that but why this spooky place? The lake would've been more romantic. - Sure, and as busy as a meat market selling 10 cent steak. - [Radio Announcer] We interrupt the music to bring you a news bulletin concerning the fiery object that was reported to have crashed in the hills east of the town an hour ago. - Fiery object, what's he talking about? - Shh, let's hear this. - [Radio Announcer] The object, whatever it was, has not been located yet, although state police are combing the area where it was seen to have come down. No trace of any wreckage or debris has been found. (dramatic music) The only witnesses to the mysterious crash, a farmer and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Stokes said they were just preparing to retire for the night when they saw a bright flash through their bedroom window. They ran to the window just in time to see what Mr. Stokes described as a giant-sized shooting star dive behind a hill and apparently explode. The witnesses were unable to say exactly how far away the fireball fell and it is believed that this is the reason the searchers have been unsuccessful in locating it. Stay tuned to this station for further developments as they occur. And now we return to music for your late-hour listening enjoyment. - What in the world do you think it was? - Not from this world, baby. You heard what the man said, it came from the sky. - Buddy, aren't you ever serious? - Sure I'm real serious right now, about you. (suspenseful music) (intense music) (screaming) (laughing) - Well, Sue, that sounds about like him. Did you have any money with you? - Enough, but I'll tell you, Judy, he's not going to do that to me again. - That's what you said the last time. Hey, there's Chris. (pensive music) Gee, he's a little early. - [Sue] Well I'll see you later. (bright music) - [Chris] Hey you ready? - Just about, but you're a little early. I'll be right back. - [Chris] Okay, hurry. (whistling) - Well, hello handsome. - Well, hello yourself way up there. - How's it going, Chris? - Couldn't be better right now. You still mad at me, Annie? - I never was, I couldn't care less. - Sure you couldn't. - [Chris] Aw, come on, now, you... (door closes) Oh, hi honey. - Hi, honey. (calm instrumental music) - Well, where shall we start? How about a nice drive in the country? - Oh just like that huh? Are you sure you wanna go with little me? Or have you ever seen the country with Annie? - [Chris] Now don't be like that, you know that's all over and done with, don't ya? - Well I certainly thought so, but I no sooner turn my back and I see you looking up there with those big cow eyes. - Oh gosh, I was just talking to her, now come on, you know me better than that. - Well, you did date her a while and I suppose it's okay just to talk. But that all you'd better do, Chris Johnson! (laughing) - All right, okay, let's go. (engine revving) (upbeat jazzy music) Mmm, this is more like it. - Yeah, all we need is a loaf of bread and a jug of wine. Say, we're really in the wilderness. - Yeah. Make it a Coke and darn, we got it made. - Ew, you dirty young man, come on, let's get next to nature. (laughing) - Okay. (contemplative music) - Hmm, this is nice. - Yeah. - It's good to get away from everyone sometimes. You know, I mean really get away. - It really is. - Say, isn't this the spot where the flying saucer landed? - Oh, the radio only said a flaming object, it could've been a shooting star or a satellite or anything like that. - Okay, boy, so I'd like to think it was a flying saucer with little green men that come to say, "Take me to your leader." - Yeah, then we'd be all over the newspapers. But, but seriously, have you, have you ever thought about, well, sometimes when I'm alone I think about the things that we don't know about. About the sky and the Earth and the air and the wind and, well, even this leaf. - Well Chris, I didn't know you were a philosopher. You sound just like Professor Clary. - Well, I suppose I do. But Clary's lectures have started me to thinking. Like, oh, you don't really know what keeps this Earth in orbit or what's out there in space. Sometimes when I'm by myself I... (pensive music) - There they are. Hi, we thought we'd find you two out in the boondocks. - Yeah, it's so good to see you. - We're going down to the beach and have a dance then, you guys wanna come along? - Ah, no thanks Rog, we'll see you down there later, maybe. - Oh, all right. You two have fun. - We'll try. (calm instrumental music) Come on, Chris, let's take a walk. (low murmuring) - Hey, you were comparing me a moment ago with Clary, did I ever tell you about the day that he slipped right off his desk and fell in the middle of orals? - No, how in the world did he fall off his desk? - Well, you know the way he props himself back on his spine like he does. Well on this particular day, well, they had just treated the floors and he had both feet out in front of him, both of them slipped and kapow, he fell. (laughing) - Oh, poor old Professor Clary. I can just see him doing that. Then what happened? - Well then he gets up off the floor and adjusts his glasses, you know the way he does, and says, completely unrattled, "All right, class, now that I have succeeded "in fracturing my left fibula, my right tibia, "several vertebrae as well as caving in "a portion of my ribcage, we might as well "continue with the oral examinations." (laughing) - Oh, Chris, you sound just like him. - Judy, want me to clue you in on something? - [Judy] Sure, what? - You're something else when you laugh. I mean, you're special. Mmm, just like the song says. Sweeter than wine. - Uh-huh. And you'd better not have any more, your liable to get drunk, and remember, you're driving. - Come on now, what's with this running off bit? Long weekend, remember? We don't have to be back in class 'til next Tuesday. - Well what do you wanna do? Spend the next four days out here? - Hey, that's the best idea I've heard today. - Sorry, but I've gotta get back home before Mrs. Pierce thinks we've eloped. - Hey, that's another good idea. (laughing) - Big talk, nothing but big talk. You know you wouldn't get married if your life depended on it. - [Chris] Why, you! (laughing) (Chris stammering) (laughing) (upbeat music) (laughing) (screaming) (siren blaring) (suspenseful music) (distant conversation) - [Ben] Well, Clint, was that fiery object that crashed last night what they were looking for? - Yep, a rocket. - A rocket? - One of ours. And would you believe it? Those government boys were already there. - How the hell did they beat us out here? - Beats me how they do it, but I'll tell you one thing, they won't get my vote in any popularity contest. - [Ben] What do you mean? - I mean that thing crashed right here in my county and they won't let me near it. Makes be about half sore. - I can't say that I blame you. - Aw, come on, we're wasting time here, let's go. (engine rumbling) Alan, Alan Clayton. - Clint Crawford, or should I say Sheriff Crawford? - Ah, Clint will do, how are you, Alan? - Fine, fine. Say, I heard you were elected over old Todd Potts by a landslide, congratulations. - Oh, well, thanks. Oh, you haven't met my Chief Deputy. Ben Whitfield, Professor Alan Clayton. - How do you do? - Hi, how are you? - Fine. - Alan was head of the biology department at the university before you came here. But I thought you were over at Cape Kennedy? Well, what are you doing out here today? Is that one of the rockets you built and now they're mad at you because it cracked up? (laughing) - I wouldn't be at all surprised. No, I guess they just figured they had to have an egghead in on the party. - Well, I hope you get along with those government boys better than I did. (siren wailing) - Wonder where they're going. - I don't know. Hey, there's a call coming in. - Right. - Clint, I guess your business kinda keeps you hopping too, doesn't it? - [Clint] Sure does. - Well, listen, I've gotta get over and see what these government boys want. Say, why don't you come over to the house some night and have a cold beer with me? - Well thanks, I just might take you up on that. - [Alan] Do that, Clint, nice to see you. - Bye Alan. - Yeah, okay Pat, we're only about five minutes away from there now. Unit one out. - What's up? - Pat says it's murder. - Where? - Satan's Hollow. (dramatic music) (engine revving) (engine roaring) (pensive music) (tense music) - The Bennett girl's dead, the Williams boy's still alive. Ambulance driver said it's hard to tell how bad he was hurt, sometimes a lot of blood makes it look worse than it is. - I sure hope so. - Clint, have you ever seen anything as bad in your life as the way that little girl was chewed up? There wasn't even enough left of her face to identify. - I know. I hate to think how her folks are gonna take it. - What kind of a killer could do a think like that? - I wish I knew. - What the devil's going on around here, Clint? I went out there where that thing cracked up and those government boys wouldn't let me near the place. - Same thing happened to me. Seems it's in my county but outside my jurisdiction. - Now one of them told me you fellas followed the ambulance down here so I headed this way. What's going on? - Murder, Wes. Girl chewed to pieces, boy barely alive. - Who, Clint? - Buddy Williams and the Bennett girl. - When did it happen? - Sometime last night. - [Wes] Any idea who did it? - No, no idea. - You should've seen that little girl's body. - What do you mean? - I'll tell you later. Come on, help us look around, Wes. - Let me get some pictures first? - No, first we try to find some kind of a lead. - Okay, where do we start? - Ben, you go north, while don't you try that direction? I'll take the woods, and be careful. (suspenseful music) (mysterious music) (guttural grunting) (playful music) - [Wes] Clint, hey, Clint! (mysterious music) Clint, Clint, I found something? - What is it? - Come and see for yourself. - What's happened, what's all the yelling for? - [Clint] Wes found something, let's take a look. - Now this is where something came out of the woods onto the road here. And over here, where the ground is soft, it left some tracks. You ever see anything like this in your life? - Nope, can't say as I have. Got any ideas, Ben? - Well, I'll tell you what it looks like. A bull gator leaves tracks something like this. - A gator, walking on his hind legs? - Clint, I said it looks like it but these are different, they're larger, much larger. - Well, the tracks seem to be coming from that direction. Ben, suppose you backtrack, see what you can find out? I'll follow them and see where they lead. - All right, Clint. - Well, what about me? - Oh, you go back to the car, call Pat. Tell him to bring some plaster out here so I can make a moulage of these tracks, tell him to make it snappy. - All right. - Oh, and Wes, don't say anything about this to your newspaper, at least not for the time being. - Clint you know I have a respon-- - Look, Wes, I mean it. - Okay, Clint, for the time being. (mysterious music) (intense music) (discordant music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Sheriff, you're gonna get run over one of these days, stepping out in front of cars like this. - [Darlene] Hi, Clint. - Hello, Darlene. What are you kids doing out here? - We heard there was some action out this way last night. - Yeah, a flying saucer or something fell, we thought we'd come out and see it. - The state fuzz up the road there wouldn't let us near the place. - Well, they had their reasons. Where you headed now? - Out to our cabin to have a barbecue and play some records. - Well I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you kids to forget the party and go on back to town. - Oh, hold on a minute, Sheriff. - Look, I haven't got time to stand here and argue, you'll have to forget the party, I mean it. - Now wait a minute, Clint. Just because you may be my future brother-in-law doesn't give you the right to tell me what to do. - No, it doesn't, but being Sheriff does. - Oh now, listen to the big, tough Matt Dillon type, what are you gonna do, give us 'til sundown to get out of town, Sheriff? (all laughing) - No, I'm gonna give you about one minute to turn this car around and get outta here. Because I'm about to lose my patience. - Well, I've already lost mine, fuzz. - Look, punk, don't ever call me fuzz. When you talk to me, call me Sheriff. Now get outta here! (intense music) (engine roaring) - What the devil's wrong with that Bowers kid? - Aw, he's just mad 'cause I made him go back to town. Find anything? - No, the tracks seem to lead off into the east there but I lost them here where the ground gets rocky. - East, huh? - Yeah, they seem to come from the general direction of where that rocket, say, where the rocket fell. You don't suppose there's any connection between the rocket and this thing-- - No, I don't see how. Come on, we got work to do. (somber music) Any calls yet? - Yeah, one. - Pat on his way? - [Wes] Should be here any minute. - Good. - Clint, bad news. - [Clint] What's that? - The Williams kid didn't make it. - Aw, that's tough, he was a nice boy. - That's too bad. - Who's gonna break the news to the parents? - I'll have to do it. Ben, go down and patrol that river road until I get some state police up here. And don't let anyone near that place. - [Ben] Right. (upbeat jazzy music) - This is a bomb, we had a real swinging weekend planned and that stupid Sheriff had to go and blow it. - Hey, you know, they're all the same. You pin one of those dime-store badges on 'em and all the sudden they're big men from tough town. - The nerve of that guy. What does your sister see in him anyway, Darlene? - It's a long story. He and Bob, you know, Joan's husband, were close friends, they fought together in Korea. Then when Bob was killed and Clint finally got back, they kind of drifted together. The weird thing is, she's really stuck on him. - Boy are you lucky, gonna have a real live sheriff in the family. (laughing) - I'll only be a minute, Pat. - Hi, honey, aren't you a little early? - Joan, honey, I'm sorry, but-- - Don't tell me, our dinner date tonight's canceled? - I can't help it, something real serious came up. - I know. I was in emergency when they brought in those kids. - Then you saw them? - Yes. Clint, what happened to them? - That's what I'm trying to find out. - Well, I'm worried. They say it happened at Satan's Hollow. Darlene went up there this morning with that Rex Bowers. - Well, you can stop worrying, I ran into them and told them to come back into town. Which reminds me, why don't you discourage Darlene from running around with that Bowers boy? He's headed for real trouble. - I've talked to her, she won't listen. - Well you better have another talk with her. I'm sorry, honey, I've gotta leave. I'll call you later. - Bye honey. Take care of yourself. - You know, when I think how stupid people really are, keeping us away from the lake and blowing our party. - Yeah, I guess they think we're gonna drive out there and load their old rocket in the back seat of your convertible and then make off with it. - Haven't you heard, they think we're foreign spies. - Well I'm not gonna let the fuzz tell me what to do. I'm gonna wait until it's dark and go out there again, you with me? - Yeah, groovy. - Well, what do you think? - I'm in, but I think we should invite everybody. - Yeah, the more people the crazier the blast. Hey, there's someone we can invite. - Who? - Chris Jordan. He and Judy probably are looking for something to do. - Well I'll go ask him, let me out, Rex. - Wait a minute, let Carla ask him, it's her idea. - No, she wants to ask him 'cause she still has a big crush on him, right Darlene? - Shut up, Carla. - Hey, what is this anyway? - What, didn't you know? Darlene and Chris had a big item going two years ago. - If you don't shut up-- - Is it true? What about it? - Yes, we were engaged once. Why? - Well why didn't you tell me anything about it? - You never asked. - [Roger] Hey man, sit down, don't blow your cool over some chick. - Well, gee, I hope you didn't get in any trouble with your housemother. - No, Mrs. Pierce wasn't here when I came in. - Ooh, that's good. Look, why don't I pick you up about seven and we'll go for a drive or something? Maybe it'll make you feel better. Well, maybe we'll run into some of the gang and drum up some excitement? Yeah, I guess we have had enough excitement for one day. Okay, we'll do something together, just the two of us. All right, sweetie, goodbye. - [Carla] Hey, you didn't even talk to him. - No need to, I heard him telling Judy. They want to be anti-social, just the two of them. - How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. - You heard the whole conversation? - At least his side. - Lay it on us, baby, what'd he say, what'd he say? - He said what? Well you can tell him from me I don't give a damn how under-manned his department is, I need state troopers up here to help me! That's better! Now the state barracks is giving me trouble. - The state Police Chief's an old friend of Todd Potts. They're probably still sore about your getting Todd's job. - Look, Clint, I hate to bring this up right now, but-- - Wait a minute, Wes. Pat, I want you to call Alan Clayton at the university, find out if he's available tonight. If you don't find him there, try his home. Pat, use the phone in the other office, will you? - All right, Sheriff. - Okay, Wes, now what were you saying? - I was saying that I hate to bring it up right now but I've got a paper to get out. Now how long do I have to hold this story? - Look, Wes, this involves the welfare and safety of the whole county. If word of this got out right now, no telling what might happen. - Clint, I have a responsibility to my subscribers. - And I have a responsibility for their safety. Look, all I'm asking you is to keep the lid on it a couple of days, so how 'bout it? - All right. I may as well go back to the office. - Wes. This is for the state crime lab, drop it off for me, will you? - Sure, anything else? - No, that's all. Now don't forget to drop it off. I want the lab to get on it right away. - Don't worry. I'll see you later. (sighs) (intercom buzzing) - [Pat] Sheriff, I've got the Professor on the line, you want to speak to him? - Thanks, Pat. Hello, Alan? I've got a puzzle you might be able to help me with. (mysterious music) (crickets chirping) - [Chris] Hi. - [Judy] Oh, Chris, I'm so glad you're here. - [Chris] Well, what's the matter, you're shaken. - [Judy] It's simply gotten to me, Chris. Nothing like this has ever happened before. - You gotta pull yourself together, I mean, going to pieces won't help matters any. - [Judy] But what are we going to do? - [Chris] Well, we are not going to do anything except try to get ourselves back to normal. Let's get something to eat. - [Judy] Oh, I don't think I can eat anything. But I'll try. - Okay. (engine roaring) (suspenseful music) - Hi Judy, hi Chris. - Hello Betty. - Hi, Betty. - What'll you have? - [Chris] Couple of hamburgers and Cokes, I guess. - You're on your way to the blast too? - [Judy] What blast? - [Chris] What are you talking about? - The beach party. Rex and Darlene and some of the others just left, said they were going to the lake. - Chris, they don't know what danger they're in. - Aw, they'll be all right, the cops will never let 'em get near the place. - But what if they sneak in? You know how stubborn Rex is. - No, I don't, I'm not as well acquainted with him as you are. - Oh, Chris, don't be juvenile. - Look, Judy, I could care less what happens to Rex Bowers. - What about Darlene and the others? I think you should call Sheriff Crawford so they can notify the officers out there to watch for them. If any of them were to get hurt or killed, we'd never forgive ourselves. - All right. (playful music) (all laughing) - [Woman] Hey, you guys are late. - Sorry, we stopped off to get some goodies. - Hey, you have any trouble crossing through? - Nah. - Most of them are over by Satan's Hollow anyway. (group clamoring) - The Sheriff isn't in his office. - Did you try Darlene's sister? - Yeah, but she had already left the hospital. I called her house and she isn't there either. - Okay. We'd better go to the lake and tell the gang to stay away from there. - Whatever you say. - Hey, what about your order? (jazzy dance music) (crickets chirping) (engine rumbling) (jazzy dance music) - [Clint] What do you make of it, Alan? - [Alan] Well, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. - Why do you say that? - Well, it does have some familiar characteristics, but there are also certain differences. - Differences? From what? - [Alan] Like from an alligator print, that's what this impression resembles. - Strange, that's what Ben said. - And you say you tried to follow the tracks? - Yeah, yeah but we lost 'em on hard ground. - Hmm, say, how 'bout a drink? - No thanks, I'm on duty. - You don't mind if I have one, do you? - Be my guest. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (phone ringing) - Sheriff's office, Deputy Lance speaking. Oh, hi Joan. No, he isn't here right now, he drove over to Lanesburg to Professor Clayton's house. Yeah. - Then you're not sure what kind of animal made that track? - Nope, but I'd like to study the moulage a little longer. - All right, Alan, but I need to know something as soon as possible. - Right, I'll try and let you know something by morning. - Fine, I'd appreciate it, night Alan. - Goodnight, Clint. (calm instrumental music) (crickets chirping) - Unit one calling base, unit one calling base. Pat, I'm leaving Professor Clayton's house, headed for Satan's Hollow. Unit one out. (phone ringing) - Hello. - This is Joan Scott. Is Sheriff Crawford there? - No, he just left. - Oh, I missed him at the office too. Well, thank you anyway. (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (swanky music) (suspenseful music) (intense music) (growling) - Unit one to Sheriff's office. Unit one to the Sheriff's office, come in Pat! Come in! Unit one to Sheriff's office! Come in Pat, I'm trapped in Satan's Hollow, the car's stuck! Come in, Pat, anybody! Come in! Pat, Ben, get me somebody! (intense music) (growling) Come in, Pat! Come in, my god, come in somebody! Come in, Pat! Come in Pat, anybody! My god, help me! Come in, Pat, come in, Pat! (glass shattering) The window! (gunfire popping) Come in, Pat! Come in! (intense music) (yelling) (swanky music) (growling) (growling) - [Radio Announcer] Hey there's a great new instrumental by the Wildcats, another climber for our top 40. Now if you cats want to hear the swingingest place in town- - Hey, someone's coming. - Chris and Judy. - [Rex] What are you doing out here? - [Chris] I came to tell you to take your party somewhere else. - What, and leave here? - [Roger] You're sick, man. - What's with everybody anyhow? That's all we've heard all day long, get away from here, stay away from here. It's beginning to sound like a broken record. - We have as much right here as anyone else. - Look, I'm telling you this for your own good. - Well I'm fed up taking orders, lover boy, you go take your advice and peddle it somewhere else. - Now listen, Rex. - No, you listen! Nobody invited you and little miss Sunday School out here. This is our private blast and if you don't dig it, split! - I'm just trying to help you. - I said split! - Look, buddy, don't push me. (intense music) (grunting) - Okay, okay, you've proved your point. - All right, I'm telling you for the last time, and you'd better take my word for it. You're in a lotta danger if you stay here. End of advice. Come on, Judy. - [Darlene] You okay, honey? (crickets chirping) - Helen's beginning to get too cold for comfort out here anyway. - Yeah, gang, why don't we go over to Mitch's house, he has a heated swimming pool. - [Man] Yeah, come on, let's go over to my pad. - Coming Rex? - Aw, you cats go ahead and split if you want to, I'll leave here when I get good and ready. - Yeah, but you got the wheels, remember? - So ride with Mitch! - Hey, don't get touchy about it. Come on, Carla. - What about you, Darlene? - I'd better stay with Rex. (calm instrumental music) Come on. (crickets chirping) Does it hurt much? - Nah, just a scratch. - Shall I kiss it and make it well? - I thought your sister was the only nurse in your family. - Nuh uh, shows you how wrong you can be. (ominous music) (growling) (screaming) (intense music) (growling) (growling) (crickets chirping) (screaming) - [Darlene] Help! - Oh my god! (growling) - [Darlene] Come on, let's go. (yelling) (growling) Please open it. Hurry, oh hurry! - [Joan] I can't get it open! - Quick, over here! (gunfire popping) Joan, get into your car, quick! - Clint, I can't leave you! - Get outta here! (growling) (gunfire popping) (suspenseful music) (growling) (intense music) - [Judy] He didn't hurt you, did he? - [Chris] No. - [Judy] Well, I still don't know a lot about it, but I think we should've told them. - [Chris] Maybe you're right, but the Sheriff told us not to say anything, remember? At least anyway, I tried. - [Judy] Oh, Rex will never listen to anyone. But I guess the Sheriff knows what he's doing. - [Chris] I sure hope so. (suspenseful music) - [Judy] Oh, Chris, this is creepy all of the sudden. - [Chris] Yeah. Hey, that's the Sheriff's car! - [Judy] I don't see anybody around. - [Chris] I think I'll take a look. - [Judy] Wait, Chris, don't leave me! - Okay, come on. Don't, Judy, don't look. - What is it? - It's Ben Whitfield, he's dead. - Oh Chris, let's get out of here. (leaves crunching) Chris! - [Clint] Chris! Chris! Chris, Judy. - Sheriff Crawford! What happened to you? - Nevermind, where's Ben? - In the car. (suspenseful music) - [Clint] Let's get back to town! - [Chris] Yes sir! - I don't care how shorthanded you are, I need more men! You sent me two men two patrol that whole area. Some kids slipped past 'em last night and one of the kids was killed. Now what am I supposed to tell his parents, that their state patrol couldn't spare the men? No, I need at least 20 men! Then they'll be there in an hour. Fine. Pat, come here. I want you to go out there and meet those troopers. See they cover every road leading in there. That one, that one and the Satan's Hollow road. I want that whole area sealed off, got it? - Right. - Now hop to it. I'll be along later. - [Pat] Yes sir. - Honey, how's Darlene? - She'll be all right. I left her at my aunt's house with a doctor. Poor kid was in shock. All the way home she just sat there beside me, as rigid and motionless as a mannequin. - Well shouldn't you be with her, I mean, there's no, what did you say? - About Darlene? - No, no. The part about the mannequin. - Clint, I don't understand. - Just a minute, honey. (phone ringing) - Gazette, Blau speaking. Clint, got anything I can print yet? - No, not yet, but there is something you can do for me that could get you the biggest story you've ever printed. Now I want you to get in touch with Maury Stern. He won't be at his store this late but I'm sure you can find him at- - Okay, I'll take care of that for you. - Goodbye, Wes. Alan! I didn't expect you here tonight. - Well, after some consideration I thought I'd better talk to you again. Could I speak with you alone? - Well sure, Joan if you and the kids don't mind. - [Joan] We'll get a cup of coffee. - All right, Alan, what's on your mind? - Well Clint, I'm afraid I wasn't being entirely honest with you earlier this evening. To tell you the truth, as soon as I saw that moulage I had an idea what that creature was. - [Clint] Why didn't you tell me? - Well, I'll try and explain. When I was at Cape Kennedy I was involved in space research. Well, it was top secret work so, naturally, there were some people I had to check with before I could give you any information. - Then what you're saying is that this creature, or whatever it is, is connected with the government space program? - I believe so. You see, we were involved in a project called Operation Noah's Ark. The purpose of the project was to try to ascertain the effects of cosmic radiation on live animals. Well, we sent a rocket further out into space than any rocket containing life had ever gone. It contained over 40 different kinds of animal life but when it got 300,000 miles out, which is well beyond the moon, we lost contact. Well, after about three months, we abandoned hope and gave it up for lost. And then suddenly, last night, one of our tracking stations picked it up again as it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. Now the thing that was strange about it was the length of time it had been gone. Almost six months. - Then what happened? - Well, you know the rest. That was it that fell outside of town last night. That's why they wouldn't let anybody near it. - And that's why they brought you out there? - Clint, I can't begin to describe the horror of what we found inside that wreckage. I'll never forget the sight of those horrible mutations. - They were still alive? - Some of them were. The rest of them had been eaten by something huge. - Yeah, yeah, I ran into that something earlier this evening, it almost killed me. It's killed four times already. It's not gonna kill again if I can prevent it. Chris, you and the girls can come in now. Chris? - Yes sir? - Your father owns a construction company, doesn't he? - [Chris] Yes sir. - Here's a list of things I need, can you get 'em for me? - Sure, no sweat. - Okay, meet me at the West Shore intersection as soon as possible. - Yes sir. - Hey Chris, wait for me! - Well Clint, have you got a plan? - Yep, you ever go duck hunting? - Duck hunting, why sure. - Then you know about decoys. - Mm-hmm. Would you mind making it a little bit clearer? - On the way out there. Joan, I'll drop you off at your aunt's. - No, I'm going with you, I'm not staying behind not knowing what's happening to you out there. I'm going and that's final. - All right, come on. (suspenseful music) (low murmuring) - Oh, the place is covered. - State Troopers have all roads covered, the area is completely sealed off. - [Pat] Good. - [Wes] Past 11, he ought to be here. - [Pat] Here he comes now. (mysterious music) - [Clint] Pat, how's it coming? - [Pat] Area's sealed off tighter than a drum. - [Clint] Fine, how 'bout you, Wes, get everything? - [Wes] Everything but one thing. - Joan! Honey, I hate to ask you this, but there's one small favor you can do for me. Now Wes got everything except one item... (suspenseful music) - [Chris] Sorry I'm late, Sheriff, but some of the stuff was hard to find. - Okay, Chris, put it in Wes' car. Chris. - Yeah? - Why did you bring Judy with you? Why didn't you take her back to her dorm? - Well, I didn't want to delay you, I thought you wanted the stuff right away. - All right, you stay in the car with her. - Yes sir. - Everybody, move out! (suspenseful music) - Chris, what does he want with all that stuff? - I don't know what he wanted with it. (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (growling) (growling) (ominous music) (growling) (intense music) (screaming) (crickets chirping) (intense music) (growling) (growling) - [Chris] Sheriff, it's after us! (ominous music) - [Clint] Get over behind those rocks! (growling) (gunfire popping) (explosion booming) (suspenseful music) - I bet Maury Stern never thought one of his mannequins would end up as a booby trap, huh? (men chuckling) (happy music) - You all right, honey? - Yeah, except for my favorite uniform being blown to pieces. - I'll buy you all the uniforms you want. (dramatic music) (upbeat music)
