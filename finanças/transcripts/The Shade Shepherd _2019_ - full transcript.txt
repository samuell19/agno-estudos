Everyday I see the same people make the same mistakes over and over again and, I can't fix them, I understand people, but I can't fix them. Look at Pike my own fuckin' brother. It's not your job to fix people. Then what is my job Stace? I mean really who am I without that- My husband. I know and I appreciate that. But right now it's not good enough for me. Okay- Who will our son see? Just his dad that's all he needs. This is not okay. Figure it out. Stacey. I'm sorry for leaving like this... Something happened... Pike could be in serious trouble. I hope you can understand... Jack? Stay calm, Pike. Pike! Stop or you're gonna tip the boat! Jack! What are you doing man!? Stop! I can't swim Jack! Jack? You motherfucker! Come back! Don't go!

Whatever you want. Nobody will know ya. It's a new start. How far is it? So we're here. It's about 70 miles until we can get into Michigan. Once we cross state line we might be able to figure something else out. But, until then we gotta hike it. It's too risky. We can take some cans and what not, but we don't have a tent. It ain't gonna be easy. What do you say? You got the fight in you or not? Thank you. Pack those cans. Oh come on man. We can go around. We can swim across it. Grab a rope. Grab a rope. You alright?

Local authorities have widened the search through more parts of Northern Indiana and into lower Michigan. Where are we? Motel for the night. Put this on. Put it on. Found a room unlocked. Nobody will be by until morning. Really? You sure? Just act normal. Oh you gotta try this, Jack. I will. So good. I gotta ditch this truck. You can stay here, relax, shower...

And I found my way back by following this creek that seemed like it went forever. Pike you saying you know this creek? Maybe... I mean a creeks a creek but... Our house is in Southern Michigan, we're in Southern Michigan now right? Yeah. Well fuck it then, follow me. Holy shit. Looks abandoned. Good. Where you going? Look man there's a store about 3 miles up the road. You can get a map there. It's too risky and I'm too tired. Let's just park it here tonight. Shits haunted man. You really don't remember this place? Not really. You were young. Home sweet home. Brings it back, yeah? Oh yeah. You took your first steps right there. How long were we here for again? You? About 4 years. Right up to a month after dad left. And what was that story? He went for a pack of smokes and never came back? You believe that shit? Nah. I think mom stole it from a movie. Yeah, she was always good at lying for him. Was he really that bad Pike? Till I was old enough to fight back. Couldn't have been all fight. You're lucky you didn't know him. Man I miss this. Used to be pretty good ya know? At ball. Yeah we've seen your trophies. Why'd ya stop playing? When you drop out of high school they don't let ya play. Man, do you ever remember Ma going to work?

I'm just saying man she had an addiction- Watch your fucking mouth- And you of all people know how powerful that is- You don't have a clue- Pike, isn't it a bit selfish to think that everything revolves around you? Oh my God! That it's your fault for Mom, Dad, Jennifer, everybody? Why the hell you bringing up all this shit?
