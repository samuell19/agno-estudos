We have lived with the stench for a week. The whole hallway smells. Go and get some cleaning stuff there at the bathroom. Wait out here until l call. Martin, you can get in here now! Wipe out the cabinet, but don't touch it. lt smells. What is it? -Rat poison. We had agreed thatwe would avoid this. lt's fucking fermenting in the cabinet, there is a heatwave. No, l'll fix it myself now. Butwait for me on the pier when l get there. l have to get the money from the restaurant Go to the boat, we meet at the pier. All right. -Good. So, get on board now. Stay on the right side. That is good. Of course l realized thatyou weren't alone when you snatched the beer. You are going to help me with one more thing here first. Here. Place the bag in the trunk, and take an envelope in the glove compartment. lf you can do that, itwould be nice? l have to make a call here now. Yes. But ... take them both! Yes!

Thanks for your help. Thanks. You, uh... Or if you... lf you don'twant to... You can hang outwith me for a while. lf you want to help out. Nettan? -But, Gosta, you're so early. l've said this a thousand times! No stiletto heels on the parquet. The toilet? When will you fix the toilet? Do you notwater the flowers? There are living beings. Welcome. You're going to Susanne, right? She is waiting there, see. Now l have to work. -Yes, good. Hey there. How's it going? -Fine. This is Karl-Henrik, my nephew. He sings in a Pentecostal church choir. Lena is my landlord. -Hi. Well it's about all the complaints, of all the running in the stairs. Yes, it's really unfortunate. l'm renting out to some girls- who sing in the same choir as Karl-Henrik, but now l'll throw them out. No, well that might not be necessary. Just as long as this stops! Take the bucket and the handle there too. Hey. lt is this kind of self-cleaning, you know. Two speeds. Gears. Thank you. Need help, Martin? -What? No, it's all right. ltwas your birthday the other day? -No, itwas my brother. My birthday is in February. -Well, then you have time to practice driving. Hey you, are those good? l would need a cold buffet staff. Hello. This is my nephew Karl-Bertil. He is studying finance. Look at thatvino. ldiot! People should stay at home if they can't behave. What are you doing? Do you study or what? ln high school, the social sciences program. Social...? -Society. lt is mostly for people who don't know what they want to do. Where do you live? On Lidingo... but in apartment. What do you mean: but in apartment? -You say it like that. So people don't think you are rich just because you live on Lidingo. What's wrong with being rich? Now let's go. Are you ready? Hi. Sorry. Who is that? They were a bit mean so l felt sorry for him. What have you done with your hand? l slipped in the shower. But he can't be here. Weren'tyou going to get a boatwithout a stern cabin? lt'll be in the way when you go fishing. Have you thought aboutwhatwe said? -Yes l have, and l don't like it. One more thing with the stuff... A package is missing. Where is it? Ask Kenta about it. Hi. Martin. -l'll take that. No, no, no, Martin's got it. -Yeah, yeah. ltwould be really cool with a fly bridge too. We haven't received the papers from the licensing authority. lf we don't get them, we can lose our serving license, Gosta. lt's getting really nice. ls ityour dad's boat?

What are you doing? l don't know really. Gosta said l could stay for a while, He's actually quite nice. Did you want something or?. No, l have to go. Goodbye. -Hi. What did she do here? Jenny? Hello. -Hi. Do you think it's bad that l work with Gosta? No. lt's good l guess. Why? No, l wasjustwondering. No it's good, and you get more money. That's great. l'm a bit late. Hello. What are you doing? What are you doing! ''lt's a bit dirty on thejetty here. We're leaving now. -Take off your glasses. Take off your glasses, l said. -Why? Take off your glasses. l'm not gonna tell you one more time. Martin, cast off. -Are we going with our boat now? No, we won't go in any boat. Martin and l are doing this on our own. You and l are going out fishing. That's nice. Okay, so they go then. Have you? -Yes, yes. ltwould be good for me to know what it is that l should do. Absolutely. -Or whatyou want me to do. What do you want me to do? -Don't stress me, l have some plans. What does your dad do? Don'tyou know whatyour dad is working with? At some office. But he is nice and all? -Yeah. My dad was a pig. Did you get it? -Yeah. Well, Martin, what are you gonna do now? What are your plans? When l was your age... l want to go abroad. You'd have to take a year of from school and earn a lot of money. Work with me, you'll earn money. -What is it that l'm working with? Nalle and Kenta are good. But l need someone l can trust. l'm going to go abroad. That's what l want to do. No, now we're going home. -Weren'tyou waiting for someone? Yes, but l can't... l have to go back to the hotel. l can stay. -No, we'll pack up now. l want to stay. Heads, you'll stay. You stay. Yesterday Bjorn Borg won French open championship which unofficially is known as world championship on gravel. That's how it should look like. l cannot accept any more. ltwill be noticed. But of course ... l could register it as today's... Here is the license. Hakansson. ''lt's me. l justwanted to tell you that it is going very well right now. How are you? We're getting by. - Nils, can you open the door. ls Dad home? Yes, he is sick, home from work. Why? Yes, you know ... Have a good time. Thank you for calling. Bye. Jenny! Hello. You look really nice. Thanks. -How are you? l have worked a lotwith Gosta. That's why l haven't... ... been able to be with you. But, like, what are you doing now? Maybe we can go for a walk. -Gosta wants me to work at the disco. l'm a bit like a manager there you could say. But can'tyou come by there and we can meet later?. Maybe l can. Micke! Micke! Hey, Martin. Hi. -How's it going? Good to see you. -Do you want to get in? l'll getyou in. l have my buddies with me too. Your buddies l can't do that, butyou can get in. Come on now. -No, there can't be too many under aged people in there. Screw that. There isjust a bunch of old people in there anyway. We can have lunch some day? -Lunch? Now, this is the last song, last dance. Finally. Yes? -Hi. Checkout from the disco. -Good. See you tomorrow. Wait, Gosta. Please bring me my paycheck? -We'll talk about it tomorrow. Good night. Hi. Nalle and Kenta are coming soon. Could you finish this quickly. l was thinking... ... about, what's it called ... ... lf l maybe... ... lf l could perhaps startworking at the restaurant again. Don'tyou like it here? Do you want higher salary? That's not a problem. lt's not that much fun, right? No, l understand that. l will also stop. We should stop with this crap. Butyou know, don'tworry. lf they catch us it'sjust like running a red light. Who is it? Two men are looking for you, Gosta. They'll have to wait. They say they are from the police. l'm coming. Hello. Gosta Jansson. -Rune Eriksson. You wanted to see me? -Emil Kaberg. What a summer, eh? -We want to search your premises. We are from the police. -Sure. lf you don't have anything against it? -No, no. lt'll be fast. We have Athos here. Sweden's best search dog. He might look a bit scary, but he's a damn fine guy after work. Wait a minute. l have to tell you something. This is embarrassing. We have rats in the kitchen. l thought of the dog. lt takes large rats to scare the Athos. Now you search. Search! lf there is anything he'll find it. Don'tworry. You're dumping it out?! Don'tyou have any guts in your head? ls it totally empty in there? The police are here. The police? lf you react like this when the cops show up you're not suited for this work. You fucking idiot! Now we'll end this. We're ending this. Get out! This is it, get out. Stop! l've built up all of Sandhamn. l've built everything myself. You just ruin it. Fuck! Ouch! Fuck. ..Then we continue with the kitchen. -Yes. l have to ask. Can he really distinguish between food and drug scents? But Athos is a bomb dog. Bomb-Dog? We're here because the King is going to participate in the sailing race Gotland Round. What a nice dog he is. -You are so nice. Therefore, l'm very grateful- to end up by welcoming His Majesty, and everyone else to the 1975 year race of Gotland Round! l would also like to thank Director Gosta Jansson- for his brilliantwork with our club house and its restoration. And so - a toast to the King! Song - ''Royal Anthem'' l'm listening. lt is important thatyou carry this on in a way that agrees with the KSSS basic values. lntegrity, reasoning, good seamanship. ls the pain throbbing like that still? -Yes, a bit. Good. What do you do with them anyway? Don't know. lt's like a summerjob. lt seems a bitviolent. Where are you living? lt's a bit difficult to say... l've lived all over. First in America, then in England, then Belgium Skane, and so now Tyreso. Are you a Tyreso-girl? -Mm. What's wrong with that? Nothing. Are you really going for a whole year?. -l have to go. Too bad. Sorry. Can l ask you a question? Don't get mad, promise. l promise. What? Are you seeing anyone right now? -Why would l be mad if you ask me that? No, l don't. Are you seeing Gosta? -Why would l do that? l really didn't... -Tell me what it is. -Can we stop talking about it? Are you angry? -No l'm not. Have you ever kissed him? -One more thing about Gosta and l'll go. Just drop it. -You said you wouldn't get angry. But l'm not. How nice it is. -Mm. lf you would have done anything with him... -Can you shut up! Gosta's my dad, he's my fucking dad! Now you've ruined everything! l didn'twant anyone to know He's my dad! Now you've ruined it! Jenny, sorry! Watch yourself! -Shut up! What the hell are you doing? Why didn'tyou say anything? Why didn'tyou say anything? Why didn'tyou say anything aboutJenny? -This is what happens with seasonal staff. You've lied to me all the time! -l have not lied to you. l just haven't said everything. That's not such big of a deal. Jenny wanted it this way. Are you hurt? Your fucking dope buddy Kenta hit me! -Pull yourself together! l? lt is you who are into drugs. What happened, Martin? Did you fall? We'll do it like this, you go home to Marketta and sleep there. l'll sleep on the boat tonight. Can you handle that? lt'll feel better tomorrow. l'm gonna sleep here. lsn't there any wine? A drink or something? Beer?. What happened? Where's Gosta? Gosta is a fucking idiot. Do you know that he is with other girls? He fucks other chicks. He's so fucking disgusting. Sorry. He doesn't. l just said that. He'sjust stupid. Gosta really likes you, Martin. But there's another side of him as well. And it is not so beautiful. As long as that side is there nobody should get too close to him. You are a bit too close now, Martin. But l work with him. -Listen to me now. Other way around Gosta couldn't give a shit aboutyou. He has said thatwe... -You must move on. So why don'tyou do that? l'm doing that. l just have to find the right opportunity. We have to talk a little. You have to take the breakfastwith you, otherwise you'll miss the boat. The boat? -Hi. Martin, get dressed, we'll take a walk. And where did he sleep last night? l can't take this. l'll get back to you later. Come now, Martin. Well, Martin ... When l was in your age l ran away from home. l went to the U.S; l metJenny's mom. She sang in a hotel there. But she died suddenly and there l was, all alone with little Jenny. The funeral cost a thousand dollars. Athousand dollars. Martin, l'm... l'm really sorry for this thing with Kenta. Butyou have to understand it happens because... People like Kenta and Nalle, they come and go, but people like you, Martin ... Now l'm buying the hotel, taking over the inn. l'll own the whole island. But l wantyou here. Are you in on this? Can'tyou be in on this with me? The downside of being a criminal is thatyou attract other criminals. Boh! You have to be able to take a little bit of beating. So you have something to tell your buddies when you get back to Lidingo. Pull yourself together, Kenta. Sorry. -You have to mean it too. l can't. l'm tired. ltwill have to be enough with this. Sorry. -Now we forget about this. How much did we lose approximately? l don't know. Four, five, maybe. -But now we need to pay the Poles. This is what l said the whole time. l knew itwould get to this. We could mix the things ourselves. -No, wait. First of all, l don'twant that. And we don't have the stuff that's needed. -We have gathered some stuff. Yes, we have. We have. Almost everything, actually. -Wait a second, didn'twe agree on one thing? We wouldn't do this. You don't give a shit aboutwhat l say. ...well it's kind of good thatwe don't... Only this time that is. This place could be turned into a Disneyland butwith Saltkrakan theme. With Tjorven and Batsman, Teddy and Freddy. You mean Saltkrakan with Uncle Melker... who'll arrange pony rides on Pippi longstocking's horse or what? But he wasn't in Saltkrakan. -That's not so fucking important is it? You can't put Emil and Madicken together. Thatwould start a hell of a fight. l'm Sorry. ltwas stupid of me not to listen to you. l understand how you feel. My dad is also a shitty dad. Are you really gonna go? lf you also think my dad is an idiot- why are you with him all the time? Howdy! Excuse the mess. l'm cleaning up a bit here. lt's really amazing how much stuff you have. Check this out. Do you wanna grab some coffee? -No thanks. All right. Butwhat a summer we have had, right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Fuck! There you are. l have looked everywhere. Are you all right? -Yes thanks. Yes, you have a nice place here, right? Ann-Britt and l were going to eat some crayfish tonight. Do you want to come? This is Martin, Mikael's best friend. Martin came with us this summer. - Mikael hasjust arrived. There you are. -Hey. Hey, Martin. -lt is so great to see you two together out here! Martin, l've heard thatyou have a really good contactwith Gosta. lt's good for you. What a wonderful man he is. Have you met Gosta? Lenny, you've done some business... Lennart is head of the state authority. Yes, l am head of the permits. ''Let's sing a bit. Sing. Nobody has it as good as l except my father as far as l know he's conserved in alcohol in the National Museum Cheers! Micke, you two haven't seen each other so much this summer, right? lt gets better when school starts this fall. l won't go to school this fall. You're going to be an exchange student? -l don't know, no idea. Just take it easy maybe. We'll see. Martin, we invited your parents. ltwould be nice if they could be here. ltwould be so nice to have them here. -lt probably wouldn'twork. We have lots of extra beds. And in the boatwe have a huge ... My dad is an alcoholic. He's a severe alcoholic. Aha. -Martin now l think you are unfair to your dad. l don't think so. He would probably start touching you, Ann-Britt. And start a fightwith you, Ulf. And vomit all over the bedroom. That is if he would make the trip here. Well.. Thanks for the crayfish. ltwas really good. l'll get going. ltwas nice as always. Now let's sing! l'll sail back home on the director's boat. Really fucking nice. lt'd be fun if you'd come along. Justyou and me. Like always. What do you say? -l'll probably stay. What is it, what's wrong? We can go now if you want. Do you? You don't believe me? We can go tonight. Should we go right now? - No, come on. What do you mean no? -Come on. lt's okay. All right. Hello. Can l come with you? Just for a part of the way. lt might be boring for you to travel on your own. See you by the boat. Well hello. You can't sleep neither?. What do you say, should we take that cup of morningjava now? -l... Just a morningjava. Strange thatwe've never had coffee together, right? Though we've been neighbors all summer. lt's so fucking typical Swedish. People don't say hallo and don't talk to each other. You've got sugar there. So.. yes. Martin, isn't it time for you to go home soon? -How did you know my name? Are you kidding? l've heard it all this summer: ''Martin!, Martin! '' The men, they have really worked you. -Why don'tyou go home yourself? No, what the hell, l've been working all summer so l still have my vacation left. And it's booked too. So when l'm done here l'm off to Mallorca. What the hell, was it called? Maga ... Magaluf. What have you worked with here? -Don'tyou get it? Here you go. Okay, so this is how it is. We know all about Gosta Jansson and his guys. And you too. Martin Hakansson. You're in a hell of a lot of trouble. Are you gonna have a hot dog too? -No, hell, l have to hold back a bit. Bosse, have you fixed the second part? Now you and l are gonna have a little talk. Hey babe! We're leaving now. Then we'll do as decided, right? We have people everywhere. lf you don't act follow the plan, you'll see what happens. Understand? -l understand. What did you say? -l understand. Bosse? Bosse! Was there anything else we need to talk about? No, whatwould that be? -What the hell do l know? Do you? No. ls the kid okay? -Yes, he'sjust a bit low. Yeah. Well who the hell isn't? Well, who the hell isn't? Good boy. Get out. l'll see you next summer then? -No, then Martin will be head waiter. No ... As a guest, l mean. -Yes. Thanks, Fritz. Take care. -You too. No, wait, damn it! This will also go on the front. The microphone must be attached. Now we can test the mic. -Yes. Put on your shirt. Say something: ''One, two, three.'' ''One, two, three. Yes, itworks. -All right, Martin. You, uh... l have talked to the prosecutor. You'll probably do okay because you've cooperated with us. Just so you know. lt'll be all rightyou know. Whatwas that? -What did you say? Whatwas that noise? - A hedgehog. lt's cooking fine. l told you so. What the hell was that? Damn, you scared me. You could say hello or something. -Where have you been? l need to talk to you about something. Notwith them. Guys, you can get out for a while? l'll keep control over this. lt's nice to get some fresh air. Yeah, yeah. Yes? What's so damn important? Why the hell do you come rushing in like this? l've told you thatyou can't be here when we work! Yeah, you just stare! lf you haven't seen a drug factory, now you have! Then, look damn it. We are drug dealers. And what are you gonna do about that? Just run to the cops. Once they get here, we're long gone. You curious bastard. Can'tyou just go? Hey. Stavsnas. Hey, Gosta. How's it going? -Good. Crime Division has cracked Sweden's best organized drug league ever. The police thinks that Sweden's drug king is caught now. We've managed to catch the obvious leader, he has had talented, good employees. They have distributed the drugs using hi-speed cars and racing boats. Now the time is 3:15 and the hearing of Martin Hakansson is completed. What happens now? -The prosecutor takes over. And decide if you're going to be detained or not. Then itwill be a trial and a sentence. Will l go to prison now? -You won't end up in the high security. Butyou'll have to count on juvenile detention. But they said that if l helped you l wouldn't have to go to prison. Oh, Stig pulled that story on you? Sorry. You shouldn't believe everything. That's a trick that he's learned from ''Kojak''. Boh! What the hell are you staring at?! Hey. Stand still. You are free. There's the exit. At a press conference today the police didn't comment on the information that there could be, a yet uncaught, leader of the so called Sandhamn league still out there... Martin. Martin! The man should have helped establish the league but according to the prosecutor he doesn't exist, and the investigation will not be continued. Howdy kid! Did you get all your things with you? -Yes. l thoughtyou might be a bit hungry. l mean the food in there wasn't the best, right? Am l free now? -Yes, you can put it thatway. You know, you need to start thinking before you talk. Be an adult and take some responsibility. You can't be sure l'll be here the next time. How did you get me out? -l pulled some strings and so.. What do you mean? -Martin you don't understand this. Butyou don't have to be grateful or anything like that. l'm not the slightest bit grateful. -Okay? The only reason you got me outwas because you were afraid that l would tell on you- thatyou got the license for Gosta. All authorizations. Don'tyou think l understand? What did you have to pay? How much did it cost? How much did l cost? The prosecutor was given a berth at Sandhamn. And some other stuff too, but that's nothing we need to talk about. Butyou're right.l have to grow up and take more responsibility. God knows it's not free to live. Today Stockholm's District Court announced the verdict in the trial against the so called Sandhamn League. The main defendantwas sentenced despite his denial to eightyears in prison. The restaurant manager's two accomplices got five and three and a half years in prison. All were sentenced for serious drug offenses. Martin! -Hi, Mom. Finally. We have missed you so much. We heard just an hour ago thatyou're coming. Hi, Martin. We have to celebrate you've come home. -Yes. Cheers. Are you still sick and home from work? Yes, well, it's something with the back. But they don't find anything. As if there were nothing there. -You know l have pain.. you know. Yes, yes, l didn't mean it like that. -No, butyou know it. l think l'm going to bed. But l've cooked spaghetti and meat sauce. Good night. This came for you. ls this whatyou're looking for?. ls it this? Martin... Was ityou who had it all the time? Give it to me. -No, l'll throw it away. No. Don't be silly now, Martin. -Nils, come to bed. Shut up, fucking bitch! -Don't touch her! Sorry, take it easy. Just give it to me. Dad, go to bed. -Give me the bottle. Give me the bottle. Give it to me. -Go to bed! What happened next? l saw dad in the closet. He didn'twant to go out. Then we fought. Did he hityour mother too? Yes, if l remember correctly. He was really aggressive. You know thatwe need to contact social services? ltwill cause some problems, but will also helpful, if you want it. Yes it'll probably be good. Nils? -Mom. Oh god...! Jenny writes: Hi, Martin. How are you? l'm great. Hope you're not mad at me. l should have told you about my father, but l didn't have the courage. ln retrospect, what happened might be mostly good. Dad and l have contact now. He calls every day from jail. Hope you have a good time. Perhaps we'll meet sometime. Hugs and kisses - Jenny. Hello! Oh. How did you find your way here? -Map. l have to continue. What are you going to do? Eh? l don't know. Sorry. l'll be off at six today. We can meet then, if you want. Mm.
