You know, dear, there's such a stigma against people that choose to live their lives in solitude. We're crazy, weird or broken. But what most people fail to understand is that maybe people like me see things very clearly and they're the ones that are oblivious to the dangers out there. Just dating, having families, going out for drinks with friends at bars, opening themselves up. And then they call people like me paranoid, while we're the ones that were right all along.

Let's take it to the next level. What do they want? Are they good? Are they bad? What do they want? Domination at any cost.

I know you're worried about your mother. She's strong. We have to believe she's going to pull through. I know. You're right. It's just been really hard. And not seeing her is... Why haven't we seen you in so long? Your mother and I were very close as children, all the way through to our 20s. We just chose different paths for our lives. Things got busy. I blinked and bam, the little girl I once knew was almost an adult. I'm sorry, I didn't make an effort to come see you more. And your mother. That's why I have to believe she's going to pull through. I hope to get a chance to make things right. Like before the change happened. [eerie music] It's not all on you. Don't feel bad. Mom could have tried harder. We all could have.

What is young love? It's almost certain you'll move on from each other, it's not permanent. It's hormones and insecurities, neediness and jealousy. Believe me, you're better off. Believe me. I wish it was that simple. He just basically lied to me about everything and destroyed our entire plan. I guess we're talking about this. So Josh is a year older than me. He was going to put off school for a year and work to save money. And then when I graduate, we were going to move out together and go to the same school. Now apparently he wants to go to college now and not defer. And he got accepted into a totally different school I didn't even know he applied to. Guys are fucking liars. All people are liars.
