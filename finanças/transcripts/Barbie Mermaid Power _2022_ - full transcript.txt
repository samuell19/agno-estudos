[LAUGHING] Skipper! We're here to pick up trash, not seaweed. [CHUCKLES] My bad. I love spending time with you and your sisters. It reminds me why being an only child is so great. You're a Roberts. Barbie Brooklyn Roberts, to be exact. That makes us practically sisters. Not the same, but still cool, Barbie Malibu Roberts. I got one! I got a whole bunch. [CHUCKLING] That's great, Chelsea. Hunh. [SIGHS] This is such a big job. It's kind of overwhelming. Every little bit helps, right? It would be nice if we could just snap our fingers and "poof." Too bad magic's not real. Um, Barbie? [BOTH] Which one, Stacie? My sister one. Your bag is glowing. Oh. Whoa! Oh, I can explain... sort of. Um, it was a gift... from a mermaid. So... A mermaid? You know that sounds crazy, right? Probably the reason I never told you. But it's totally true. We met her on vacation one time. She needed my help to save some dolphins. Then we got mixed up with this crazy scientist named Marlo... Anyway, it was a thing, so, um... And the glowing necklace? The mermaid, Isla, gave it to me as a thanks and as a way to connect if she ever needed my help again. Looks like she needs your help again. [CHUCKLES] Hey there. Pretty. But what are we waiting for? We have to go help Isla! Oh, you want to come too? I'm seven, and I'm obsessed with mermaids. Do you even have to ask? I want to be a mermaid. We do get to be mermaids, right? How cool would that be? You promised Mom and Dad we'd all stick together. They're not going to be too happy if you put an entire ocean between us. [CHUCKLING] You win. We'll all go see Isla. [CHEERING] Yay! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're all down with this? What am I missing? I know. This is weird and crazy and seems impossible. But, sometimes, to see the impossible you just have to make the leap. - [BIRD CHIRPING] - Whoa! What do you think? I've never even seen a bird like you before. I'll take it as a sign. [BIRD CHIRPING] I'm in. Alright! Okay, how does this work? [LAUGHING] [ALL] One, two, three! [GASPS] Amazing! Oh, wow! [LAUGHS] Whoa! - Whoa! - Wow! Beautiful! Yeah! Isn't this awesome? Whoa! Oh! Woo-hoo! Look at this tail! Whoa. Whoa! [LAUGHING] [GASPS] Hi! [LAUGHING] Girl, we have gone on a lot of adventures together, but this one takes the cake, the crab cake. [CHUCKLING] Do not be fooled by their whimsical appearance in legends and fairy tales. Brace yourselves for this, people. Are you braced? Mermaids are real. [CROWD MURMURING] Mermaids? [CHUCKLING] Is she for real? Is this serious? With all due respect, Marlo, you've been trying to convince us of this for years. We're scientists. We need proof. Where is your proof? I'm glad you asked, Dr. Tang. [CLEARS THROAT] Whoa, whoa! This shell tiara was found on a tiny rock out in the middle of the sea. I believe it once belonged to a mermaid. [SCIENTIST] Is this a joke? That rock is the epicenter of a well-documented phenomena known as "The Mermaid Moon". It appears once every hundred years. I have it on very good authority that when the first ray of the Mermaid Moon hits this specific location, all mermaids come to the surface of the sea to soak in the moon's energy. And what is the source of this good authority? Well, um, it's... My granny told me about it when I was a little girl. - [SCIENTIST] Absurd! - [SCIENTISTS LAUGHING] [SCIENTISTS] Right. - What a waste of my time. - Is this in the budget? This is ridiculous. This lecture is over. Wait! Don't go! I'm not finished. Yes, you are, Marlo. We are officially revoking your funding. But, but... Please, Marlo, come on. Our oceans have far more pressing issues to address. Stop wasting our time with your frivolous fairy-tale witch-hunt. It's not a witch hunt. They're mermaids. It's a... mermaid hunt. [GROANS] Get over here or you're fired. Oh, oh! Well, it was a good gig while it lasted. Hm. Here's an interesting job I can apply for. Tropical beverage taster. I wonder if they'll let me work from home. Ah! Funding or no funding, I will continue my mission. A real live mermaid in captivity will bring a pretty penny on stages across the world. Then we'll see who has the last laugh. [DIABOLICAL LAUGHING] I should probably get a new ringtone. Whoa! Uh, that's a shark. It's okay. She's as afraid of you as we are of her. Afraid? No, I'm just so... thrown. Everything I thought I knew just... isn't. But, um, is it different under water or do we not still have a mission to start? And where exactly are we going? - Wow! - Whoa!

Well, I don't even know where to start, because with the Mermaid Moon so soon, we've got the ceremony to prepare for, but without the right powers we can't. So, the golden pearl picked but left two people out and I knew where to look for one, but I wasn't sure until... Oh. Maybe it'd be easier if I show you. ♪♪ I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope I'm an earth mermaid. Why? Duh, Finn, because I like making things grow. - How cool would that be? - Cool, sure. But who wants cool when you can have fire power? Being able to heat water and control volcanoes. It's literally hot. Whatever, Finn. What power do you want, Talleigha? I really don't care which one power I get. - What? - What? I plan to have them all. Why am I not surprised? You want to be the Power Keeper. The one mermaid who can control every power. The one at the center of the ceremony. All eyes on her as she lifts Mermaid Rock to the sky. - Whoa. - Look at Talleigha! [CHUCKLING] Look who's already getting her air power. And water and earth. Once I get fire, no one will be able to rival me for Power Keeper. That's not how it works, you know. We all get a little of every power. But the one we're supposed to have is the only one that sticks. Unless you're the Power Keeper. You think it's you, Aquaryah? It could be. Look, I'm already getting water power. Mm! Whoa! [CRASHING SOUNDS] You're way too young to swim with us big fish, Aquaryah. But don't worry, it'll only be another 100 years until the next Mermaid Moon. Good one, Talleigha. [LAUGHING] Baby sis, what are you doing here? Talleigha's right. You'll never have your powers by this Mermaid Moon. [SIGHS] How do you know? I just know, okay? [PUFFERFISH SQUEALS] Wait for me! ♪♪ So many mermaids! It's like Merchella. [CHUCKLES] This place is amazing, Isla, but you still haven't told us. Why are we here? To get your powers, of course. Powers? As in "superpowers"? Kinda. I'm a mermaid of air. It's why I can breathe air, like you. Do we all get powers? Oh, I need a good mermaid hero name. I could be... Gill-Girl! Hi-ya! - Hi-ya! - [PUFFY SQUEALS] Hey, you scared Puffy. - It's okay. It's okay. - [SPUTTERING] Sorry. [CORALIA] So, you've brought us not just one, but two humans to compete in the games? Coralia, yes. Meet Barbie and Barbie. - Hi. - Hello. Isla believes humans are the answer to our problems. Many of us see you only as the cause of them. I look forward to you proving Isla right. [CHITTERS] Who's this? [CHUCKLING] That's Viva. She's a vaquita. [CHITTERS] [GIGGLING] Hi, Viva. It's great to meet you too. Aw, what a cool pet. We don't have pets here. We treat all creatures equally. Oh, excuse me. You're definitely cool and totally not a pet. Attention, everyone. There are now eight candidates for Power Keeper. The final two have come to us all the way from the surface. Psh. Land dwellers? No way. They don't belong here. They'll never be as powerful as we are. They're the reason we need powers. They seem cool to me. For the benefit of our guests, let me remind everyone what's at stake. The future of our world is in your hands. My bet's on Talleigha! None of us knows who will be chosen Power Keeper. No matter who they are, we must show every creature dignity and respect... equally. I will see you all at the feast. Until then, behave. Get in some practice. Tomorrow, we begin. [SCOFFS] I think they really like us. [GIGGLING] Look at me! Zero gravity! You can't do that on land? - Ah! Whoa! - Whoa, whoa! [THUD] Not here either, apparently. [GIGGLES] [CLEARS THROAT] Hi, I'm Skipper. This is Stacie and that's Chelsea. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. I'm Aquaryah. I always wanted sisters. Wow! Whoa, you're good. My special tail helps me balance. How come your tail is different? I was born without one, so my dad made me this one. It's pretty. Thanks. There are four challenges. One for each power.

She just means it's obvious that no land dweller will ever be the Power Keeper. It just wouldn't be natural. Land dwellers have more power than you think. Oh, I know what you're capable of. Protecting our world isn't something you do well. We're here because we want to help. That would be a welcome first. [ISLA] Ignore them. Are you coming, Isla? I'll catch up with you later.

If you help us escape, we'll take you with us! You'll be free to do whatever you want. What is that? A floating island. A man-made floating island of trash. Sadly, yes. If it gets any closer to Pacifica, it will block the moon's rays and we won't be able to perform our ceremony. We have to stop it. If the Power Keeper is among us, we have a chance. Whoa. The girls are in there? [CHITTERS] [CHITTERS] You've got your prize, so can we set sail for home? Now? Please? With only two mermaids? When the moon rises I'll be able to catch even more. Then, all the world will know my name. [BARBIE] Marlo! [GASPS] Barbie! This is a really strange place to run into an old friend. We're not friends, but Marlo once tried to capture one of mine. Of course you're the one behind this! Where are the little girls? Ha! Wouldn't you like to know? - Uh, Marlo? - Not now, Oslo. I need to explain to our guest here why these little mermaids, why all mermaids, in fact, are so important to me. - Yeah, but, uh, the thing is... - You see, Barbie, when my grandmother gave me this tiara, she told me the power belongs to the sea. She knew mermaids were real because she was one. Of course I never saw her tail, but I knew it was true. That makes me part mermaid too. It explains everything to me. Why I always was drawn to the sea, why I never quite fit in on land. Why it became my life's work to prove mermaids are real. Marlo, you really need to see this. What is it? [GASPS] They're gone! - What? Where are they? - [CRASHING SOUNDS] - Whoa! - Ohhhh! What's going on? I knew we should have gotten that tune up. [GLASS SHATTERING SOUNDS] Oh, no, oh, no! We're taking on water! [STRUGGLING GRUNTS] Come on, Oslo! Do something! Ah! It's no use! We've got to abandon ship! Not without my mermaids! Whatever. I'm out of here! [MARLO] Oslo! Oh, no! I can't get it out. Ah-ha! [LOUD CRASHING SOUNDS] [BARBIE GASPS] - Whoa! - Oh, no! What? I'm a mermaid! Oh, no! My tiara! [STRAINING GRUNTS] Ah! Marlo! Listen, there is more to being a mermaid than just swimming around. A huge battle is going on. Help me get out of here. Help us. [STRAINING GRUNTS] Please, Marlo. You know the right thing to do. [MARLO'S GRANDMOTHER] Its power belongs to the sea. ♪♪ Whoa! Thank you, Marlo. Let's go. Ya! Ahhhhh! Hi-ya! [GRUNTING] ♪♪ Barbie! You're a water mermaid! What's she doing here? Helping. No one can help us now. We need the Power Keeper. [CHITTERS] She's here. - Chelsea! You're okay. - Aquaryah, you're okay. She's more than okay. She's the Power Keeper. ♪♪ Wait, me? I've been watching you this entire adventure. No one is braver, stronger or more caring. I can feel it. You have the power within you. ♪♪ It is her. Aquaryah's the Power Keeper. Everyone, aim your powers at Aquaryah! ♪♪ We did it! [CHEERING] Aquaryah! You are amazing! And you were right. You don't need my protection. I probably need yours. This was the best underwater adventure ever. You're the best underwater friend ever. You never treated me differently, even when I didn't have powers. Back home, no one has superpowers. We have to solve our problems without them. That sounds awful. Not when we all work together. [GIGGLING] I knew you had it in you. Helping people is your real superpower. It wasn't just me. Marlo stepped up. I feel so invigorated! What else can I do to help? The best way to help is to go back to your life on land and spread the word. Respect our world by treating yours better. Look!
