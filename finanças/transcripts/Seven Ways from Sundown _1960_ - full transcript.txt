A Ranger? - Now we get a Ranger. - Let's whup him. - What's the matter with you two fellas? - Tar and feather him as a lesson. - Yeah, tar and feather him. - You with us? - Come on. - Come on. - Someone mind telling me what happened? - Jim Flood happened. Flood figured he was getting cheated at poker by Ike Hanley. He shot Hanley then shot his brothers. That's when we needed us a Ranger. One finally comes along, he ain't even got brains enough to be wearing a gun. - Take it easy Beeker. - Take it easy? After Flood burns my place down and shoots four men? Without a lawman, this town depends on the Rangers. Ain't never one around when you need them. - Hey, the fire is starting up again. - Hey, get those water buckets men. Form a line men. Mind telling me how I get to the town of Buckley? - About 30 mile due north. - Which way did this Flood go? Out that way, northwest. But I wouldn't go chasing after him all by my lonesome. I'm obliged. Better get out of this town though, before they decide to hang me. - I guess you fellas are Company D. - That's right. Captain Bledsoe sent me up from Austin and I'm supposed to go to work for you. - You Lieutenant Herly? - What's your name? Jones sir, Seven Jones. You any kin to Two Jones? Yes sir, he was my brother, you knew him? I knew him. - You remember Jones lieutenant. - I remember sergeant. I've been here earlier, but I've been chasing a fella by the name of Jim Flood. You were chasing Flood? Well, not exactly chasing him, mostly just trying to see which way he went. He sort of wrecked a place called Beeker's Crossing. What happened? He burned down the saloon, shot up the place, I couldn't pick up his trail.. Get a long start. Hennessy, you'll go after Flood... first thing in the morning, I'll figure out which men you can take. - You're not going? - No, I got too much work to do here. You take care of Jones, get him settled. - How long you've been a Ranger? - Just since they signed me up at Austin. - Don't you believe in sidearms? - They said you'd issue me a revolving gun. What about Clancy's old gun? It'll be deducted from your first month's pay. - Sure is a honey. - No, it's a gun not a baby Seven. - Yes sir. - You don't call sergeants sir. You know how to shoot it? Sort of, is someplace where I could try it out? About 10,000 square miles of nothing out back a way. Come on. Take a shot at that gong out there. That's doing it the hard way. - You some kind of trick shot or something? - No. Try the rest of your shot. Only safe place in the whole valley was that gong. I'll show you your bunk and where you put your horse. As soon as you tend to your horse, maybe Mrs Karrington will give you some dinner... - if she's got any left. - Mrs Karrington? Yeah, that's her house over there. She's got the deal to feed us Rangers. - I could sure use something to eat. - Put your horse in the first stall there. Thank you. I just got a glimpse of him when he went by the house. I'll bet he's real nice. Ma? You think... Do you think the average person would like me in this dress? They told me I might be able to get something to eat. The noon meal is already over. Who sent you? That lieutenant? No ma'am, sergeant Hennessy. Well, clear a place for yourself at the table. There's some dishes in the kitchen and beans in the pot. The door over there. Hold still. - A cup. - We got plenty of cups. And two plates. - Well, I think that looks all right. - I think it's beautiful. You find beans all right? - But you didn't get any coffee. - I'll get it for him Ma. There you are mister... - Jones, Seven Jones. - I'm Joy Karrington. Ma, his name is Seven Jones. - Pleased to meet you ma'am. - Sit down. Go and eat. I'll get the hot water started and you bring the rest of the dishes, will you dear? - It's nice dog. - His name is Apache. Apache? Well, it's no funnier name than you've got. No I, I guess not. Just wait till you heard the rest of it. You see, my Pa wasn't much for fancy when it came to giving out names, so... he just named us by the numbers and let it go at that. Plain number is not much of a name. That's what my ma said too, so we always used to add something like... the firstborn was One for the Money Jones... the second was Two for the Show Jones and and right on up to me. My full name is Seven Ways From Sundown Jones. Well. - You're new on the Rangers. - Yes ma'am. How you come to join? Well, mostly was on account of my older brother, Two Jones. - He got killed working for the Rangers. - Oh, I'm sorry. That was a real pretty dress you were trying on. For the Fultons' barn raising tonight, are you going? Oh, I don't know and I haven't been asked. Well, the Fultons will be real glad to have you. - Well, maybe. - Oh, I'll get you some pie. - We ain't that hard up for men Herly. - That's for me to say sergeant. You know as well as me what kind of man Flood is. I ought to be taking a whole company instead of one new man. Jones has got to pull his own weight. You saw how he handled the gun... me and him taking on Jim Flood would be downright suicide. You're taking Jones sergeant and that's that. Hennessy. You don't think I like making that choice, do you? But I got men scattered over half of Texas. I need at least five men down in the south plateau, four men covering the Baker place... and I can't send Duncan or Hollis. Most of those men are protecting cows. Is saving a few head of cattle more important than a man's life? He joined up, didn't he? Let him earn his pay. He don't seem to know Flood was in on the killing of his brother... but finding out might make him act even more foolish than normal. I'd say he'd be the last man to send. Stay Apache, stay here boy, stay. Apache. Apache, there. There's a good dog, it's all right. There, there now. Well, just maybe he might not be the last man to send. How come you can't handle a six-shooter? Us Joneses never had too much spare cash, I never could afford one of them revolving gun. When word gets back in the morning about... Flood, you and me is going to take out after him. Good. Say, your brother ever mention anything about working for Herly? No, Two wasn't much for writing. I'm glad I'm going with you sergeant. Well, maybe along the way I can teach you about using a sidearm. I'd be obliged to you. Jones? You're staying here tonight, keep an eye in the office. Yes sir. First barn raising I've been to in a year. Lots of girls and lots of whiskey, both are fun and both are risky. Hey, wait for me. Come on Shorty, we can't keep the women waiting. Yeah, all the good looking ones will be picked. You sure smell pretty Shorty. Yeah, he smells like he climbed out of a jug of that fancy flowery water. - Let them rip. - Come on. Gal in one hand and a jug in the other. Maybe I should take the duty Seven. Wouldn't want you half asleep when we take off. I'm all right. - Hennessy. - Yeah? You said you knew my brother, how did he come to get killed? Well, I don't know much about it. - Some fracas down in the Big Bend country. - Yeah, I know that. If you should get sleepy, I'll take over. Thanks. - Oh, hello. - Hello. You don't want sit down? I thought you went to the barn raising. Oh, oh, we, we did but... Well, Ma wasn't feeling so well, so we, we left early. That's too bad. They said it was you and Hennessy going out after Jim Flood. That's right, sergeant Hennessy and me. From the stories I've heard about him, Flood must be 20 feet tall. - Don't you worry about that. - Well... It's just that, well, Ma and me we... we wouldn't want to have anything bad happen to sergeant Hennessy... - But why should it be you going with him? - Why not? I'm a Ranger. Yes, but you're so new. Yes I am but the sergeant is going to teach me as we go along. Maybe he'll be able to keep me from getting killed for the first day or two. Oh, it's just... Well, Ma sure thinks an awful lot of you, the way you saved the pup today and all... Well, she liked you right away from the first time she saw you. Yeah well, I sure like her too. She's nice, all right. Look, it isn't as if it's going to be my last night on earth. I wish you good luck. Well, report is Flood is still heading north. Likely pick up his trail around Sterling City. That far up? He sure gets a lot of distance out of a horse. Doing the impossible is just everyday living for Flood. I'll check us out, be right back. - Oh, fine morning Miss Joy. - Yes, sure is fine. - How's your Ma this morning? - Oh, she's much improved today, thank you. She was, saying how too bad we didn't get to know you longer than just one day. Well I... I'd sure like to be able to, to write you a letter sometime, if I'm gone that long. - You think it'd be all right? - Oh, I'd like that, so would Ma. Oh, I brought you a little food to take along. It's always nice to have a little extra food. Oh, it's a cake. It's a real beautiful cake, about the nicest thing anyone ever did for me. You take good care of yourself Seven. - I'll come back to see you. - Morning Joy. Cake. Hey. That's two times out of four... you hit good and close today, you're getting the hang of it. Doesn't look like we ever going to catch up with Flood. Should pull into Sterling late today. Knowing Flood, you figure he still be there? Knowing Jim? The only thing a man can know about what Jim is going to do is that he'll... darn sure never know. - Kind of full of surprises, eh? - Yeah. - Nothing, eh? - No. - Any other suggestions? - Yeah, let's have a drink. Hello boys. - Evening miss... - Lucinda. - How about a drink? - Couple of whiskeys. - And get whatever you'd like for yourself. - Thank you. Joe? Two whiskeys. Bet this is the only town in Texas where nobody ever heard of Jim Flood. They've heard of him all right. He's been here and gone. Left them all dizzy with his blasted charm. There's not many places left to look for him around here. - What you boys do? - A little of everything. - Well, I heard you're looking for Jim Flood. - Might be. What you want with him? That ain't anybody's business but Jim's and ours. - A man like that has a lot of enemies. - Jim can take care of his enemies. - It's true, you're not the law. - Do I look it? You don't. He does, kind of. Except he's young. His honest looks come in handy sometimes. If you're still doubtful, I don't suppose a lawman would know the particular place... Flood has a burn scar, shaped like an X. Yeah, well, how do you know about that? Because me, accidentally branded him one time, one time when we was drunk. If... If I do tell you where he went, will you, will you give him a message for me? Fair enough. He left day before yesterday, he's headed north towards Big Spring. Will you tell him that, that Lucinda loves him and and to please come back? Or to let me know where he is so I can go to him. We'll tell him. - I sure wish the best for you ma'am. - Oh no, the, the drinks are on the house. - Well, thank you. - You won't forget? Not a chance. - We're not headed north. - No. How come? Flood didn't go south because we come up that way. He didn't go east because is nothing out there. Pretty much leaves west, the way we're traveling, out toward the Llano Estacado. What about north like the girl said? Flood never in his life told a girl the right direction he was going. You really think we can make money off the lake Mr. Flood? Sure. After we stock it with sturgeon, we can make a million dollars selling caviar. What's that? Well, it's a fancy food the crowned heads of Europe swear by it. Crowned heads? You know, kings and queens, lords and ladies, czars and czarinas. Them people sure must've a great time of it, ain't it mister? Most of them would like to change places with us right now. - They would? - You betcha. Taking life easy is one of the delights of the world. Guess so. Gee, that sure is a mighty pretty folding knife. You like the idea of us stocking the lake with sturgeons? Sure do, I'd like to go partners with you anytime. Well, just maybe we'll do her one of these days. I've been living right over there, in part of this canyon, my whole life... and nobody ever had that idea before, they're just farmers. Well, farming is fine if you like it. Me, I'd rather do something I like and go bust than succeed at doing something dull. Yeah, makes you feel like... - That life has a kind of magic in it. - Yeah. Say, would you take another look at the flats behind us there? Sure. Still don't see nothing. Out toward the peaks, way back, look high. Yeah, there's a speck of dust way out there. People sure can be a nuisance sometimes. - You in a spot? - What, me? But they going to be in trouble if they don't quit following me. - You might tell them that. - All right. I'll sure tell them. On stocking the lake. We just might do it one of these days. - Mr. Flood? - Yeah? You forgot your folding knife. You know, that's much too nice a knife for a fellow like me to be careless with it. You better take care of it for me. Gee, thanks. - So long Jody. - Goodbye Mr. Flood. Seven. - Flood? - No doubt about it. Smoked these ever since he is a kid. About a day ahead, I'd say. You seem to know him real good. Nobody knows Jim Flood real good. But when we young fellas, we did spend some time together. - That so? - Yeah. He could always beat us others at anything, cards, women, guns... Never even seemed to try hard. How come he wound up an outlaw? Well, some people say he just never grew up. To him, this world is kind of a circus and 4th of July celebration all rolled into one. That's why he was trouble, people say. And it's also why they usually loved him, at first sight. You seem to think a fair amount of him too. Yeah, in a way. When you see the kind of a fella he is, you got to forgive him a lot of things. It's not for us to judge him one way or the other. I want you to remember that. I'll remember. - One thing I know for sure about him. - Yeah? He seems to just loaf along and rides about a thousand miles a day. Sooner or later we'll come up with him, hey... You see a stranger around here lately? Not for six or eight months. You've been making these horse tracks and munching that grass there yourself? He said for you not to follow him no more. - Don't suppose you know which way he went. - Didn't rightly notice mister. See what I mean about Flood? Stay down. I should've known, was going too easy. Hennessy? Remember what I told you, it ain't up to us to judge Flood. I'm giving you an order. You head right back for Texas. Promise me you won't go after him yourself. Not going anywhere by myself, you're going to be all right. Promise me. You sure are stubborn. Where's my hat? You one of those two fellas been trailing me? That's right. If you're going to shoot, I'd wish you'd get it over with, the suspense is awful. Hold it. That's the last one, you want it? You pretty good shot. - It's a pretty bad hole. - Doesn't look too bad to me. - What are our plans? - I'm taking you back to Texas. I imagine they'll hang you. Well, in the meantime would you be good enough to toss me my hat? Get it yourself. Looks like you'll have to carry me all the way to Texas. - That won't stop me. - You can't get far. I tell you, I'm bleeding to death. All right, we'll stay right here till that bleeding stops. - Sit down. - There's a better place close by. - Where? - Cabin of mine. Let's go. After all I did get shot. That cabin of mine is just a short way up ahead. I'm telling you this because I'm just about to pass out. You pass out and I'll let you lay here and die. This is kind of embarrassing. - I got any blood left? - I don't know. - You cutting me open to see? - I got to probe for that bullet. Way you look right now, you're more likely to stab me to death. Why don't you shut up. Honest... real nice of you, leave me out there to die after all. Well, I should've, after what you did to Hennessy. - Hennessy? - Sergeant Hennessy, Texas Rangers. Man you shot back there. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? Who cares how you feel? - What's your name? - Jones. Jones, you're a nice, likable young fella. You look real close, you'll see a small scar, right at the top of my forehead. A Comanche put it there when he started to scalp me... 15 years ago. Was Hennessy who stopped him. Let's not bring Hennessy up again. Still here. Couple pieces of beef and I'll feel good as new, how about you? I'm fine. There's food aplenty out there in the pantry. I found it. There's a lean-to out back for the horses. - Feed out there too. - I found it. I found that too. That's the only piece of artillery in the place. If you'd asked me where it was, I'd told you. I'll bet. Well, I might as well get a fire started. I'll go feed the horses, you know how to cook? All the chefs in New Orleans slink away in shame when my name is mentioned. Yeah. Steak and beans for supper. Now, this six-gun has what you might call a hair trigger. Don't put that fork down too heavy, it might go off. They're sure teaching you young Rangers to be cautious nowadays. Let me have your plate. - I noticed some rat poison in the pantry. - Jones? Your cutting knife. Is it all right that we eat now? Yeah. You're an incessant talker, aren't you? I talk when there's something to say. Tell me something... why did they send an inexperienced young fella like you after me? It's kind of insulting, nothing personal, of course. I got you, haven't I? Well, in a way, yes. But the only reason I haven't killed you is because you're a friend of Hennessy's... and you're a likable young fellow. - There's some pickles in the pantry. - I'll get them. Think pretty high of yourself, don't you? Kill me? You see what I mean? When you were watching me through the window there, you didn't watch long enough. - Well, from now on I'll be more careful. - I should hope so. - You a gambling man? - Sometime. - Want to play a little stud or draw? - I got a hunch you ain't honest. Well, let's just say I'm not easy to beat. - What should we play for? - Fun? All right money, pennies. - You sure are a plunger. - Look, I only make 26 dollars a month. I'll get some beans, each bean will be worth one penny. Well, I guess it's better than playing solitaire. - Call. - Jacks, three of them. Beats two pair. - How much is that altogether? - Let's see now, that makes 62 dollars. Better than two month's wages gone in one night. You going to have to wait a while to get paid. - Better thing to do is try to win it back. - No. We're leaving here first thing in the morning, it's time to get some sleep. - You figured out how to do that? - Yeah. You're sleeping in the pantry, there's room on the floor. I suspected as much. Good night. - Say, Flood. - Yeah? I've been thinking about you not hitting me with that poker. You miss me on purpose? It's a stupid question Jones. Yeah well, the thing is I, well... - You trying to thank me kid? - No, I'm not. - Don't call me kid either, my name is Seven. - What? Seven Ways from Sundown Jones. Well, we all have a cross to bear. Night. I wish you weren't so set on going all the way back to Texas, I kind of like it here. Well, that's where we're going. You're an easy cuss to get along with, I sort of hate to hurt you so I'll go along a ways. But I'm not going to jail in Buckley, let's make that clear, eh? I'll take two. - Twenty cents. - I call that. - Three jacks. - Straight. You sure you're not cheating? All right, I'm going to teach you something Seven. - See the back of that card? - You using a marked deck? I still don't feel like going back to Texas. Just the same, come daylight you better be ready to ride. Can't beat you young fellas for optimism. Seems to me I ought to have a strong vote in what we do just now. - Hennessy said you was full of tricks. - Yeah. So I took the trouble to unload that six-gun. You know, I'm beginning to think that you and me ought to be partners. - Game is over. - Yeah. You, owe me 86 dollars. Turn around and I'll tie you up. Right at. Thought maybe I busted your head. Speaking of heads, you got the hardest one I ever saw. Last fellow I walloped like that was out for three hours. I was out long enough. You could have shot me. This rope is kind of tight. How long you figuring on keeping me tied up? All the way back to Texas. You sure you wouldn't rather go to California instead of Texas? Texas. The least you can do is let me choose my route. There's a couple of girls I'd kind of like to see along the way. This is not exactly a sightseeing trip. It's a long way, least we can do is enjoy it. Say Seven, I don't know whether you know it or not... but I think we might be in a little trouble. - What kind of trouble? - Apaches, I suspect. We've been traveling on some of their sacred ground. I know it might seem foolish from your point of view... but I'd suggest that you untie me and give me my gun. If they are Apaches you're still going to stay tied. I'd suggest strongly that you give me something to shoot with. - You got any other suggestions? - Yeah, come on. We got some other visitors over here. How you going to fight them off from both sides at once? I don't know, but is a lot better than having to fight you too. I thought Indians always did a lot of hollering. They only do that mainly when they're trying to build up their nerve. They don't think they got any particular problem here. You keep watching that side. Looks like they're planning on joining the merriment. Well, we're not waiting for that. Get on your horse. I'd argue with you, only it's better than waiting around here all day. Of all the lousy, rotten luck, a single shot. Where you get that rifle? Look at them run. I guess they decided to do something easy... like attack an army fort rather than tangle with you and me. You know, if you had untied my hands they might have thought they were surrounded. Let's get out of here. - Cigar? - No, thanks. You know, I think I had to face life without cigars, whiskey, women, steak and cards... I'd much rather they take me out, string me up. There's an unpleasant thought, getting hung. The word is hanged. Which is what ain't going to happen to me. I've been shot 11 times, broke out of more jails than you can count... had a rope around my neck twice, so don't worry about me.. I won't. I'm still trying to figure out how they sent just you and Hennessy after me. - Your boss got something against you? - Heck no, Herly is just short of men. Herly? That's just like the Rangers, always short of something men, money or brains. You know Jones, you could've a lot more fun if you'd quit the Rangers, join up with me. I got a kind of calling. One my brothers was killed with the Rangers. That's a darn shame. - Last spring, down the Big Bend country. - Last spring? Yeap, April. Your brother, he, he look anything like you? I guess so, taller maybe. I kind of liked old Two. Seems to me I heard something about that scrap. Way I heard it, that ranger wouldn't have gotten shot... another ranger hadn't ducked out on him. How do you mean? Well, the way I heard it another lawman was supposed to be covering for him... but he hid behind a rock, never showed himself. - Seems to me it was the ranger's fault. - What else do you know about it? Nothing. Nothing at all, just picked that story up in El Paso. In any case, I sure I'm sorry about your brother. Going to get some sleep. Well, what will it be, Sterling or Hobbs? I don't want to go into a town where there'll be a lot of fuss. Just want to pick up some supplies and wire the Rangers. Then my suggestion would be to head on over towards Sterling. I thought it would be. I met your girl Lucinda the other day. - Everyone in town kind of likes you. - Well, I guess it'll have to be Hobbs then. You think we can get our supplies without a mob coming out to lynch you? We might even stop off for a quiet drink or two. Now that you wired the Rangers, and before we go shopping and you... suppose we could have that quiet drink? I guess one drink wouldn't hurt. Oh, Howdy Jim. And it was your suggestion we go to Sterling, eh? Was your decision to come to Hobbs, Jones. - Say, how in blazes you get tied up? - Well, let's untie him. Hold it. Jim. - Oh, who tied you up? - Meet Seven Jones, Gilda. Maybe we ought to drop this Jones down a well. Oh, no, no Sam, don't tangle with him, he's tougher than he looks. We ain't going to let him take you away. - Right? - Right. Hold down everybody, we don't want to get each other banged up. I'm sure Mr. Jones wouldn't mind if we all has a sociable drink. You give me your word you won't try to get away? You think my word is any good? - Yeah, I do. - You got it. - All right. - You sure are a trusting soul. First drinks are on the house, come on boys. Sit down here Jim. Make yourself at home Jones, you're among friends. - There you are, the good stuff. - Good boy. - Fill us in on what you been doing Jim. - Oh, staying sober mostly... keeping out of trouble. - What do we drink to? - Let's drink to Seven Jones... the only man I ever hit who didn't stay down. To Seven Jones. If Seven here would be willing to turn his back long enough for us to cut those ropes... between all of us here, we'd give him enough money to retire. What I've been wondering Flood, is what is it you ever did for this town. - He's just him, that's all. - Town comes to life when he's here. You know, he's, he's what every man would like to be but never is. Nobody will ever tame him. And what's more, he's never gone on a rampage in this town, which is sort of a help. How are you Jim? Maybe you ladies would like to rejoin us later? Sure. You fellas got something on your mind? Word come that Flood was here. Flood is worth $6,000, dead or alive. Word also came he was tied up. Or you two bounty hunters would be running like rabbits. Pay no heed Dick. You're a Texas Ranger young fella, on New Mexico soil. You know the law? - No. - But he upholds it anyhow. We got us duly constituted authority here, you ain't. You got to turn him over to us. We'll guarantee he won't get away. - I don't like your looks mister, sorry. - Maybe we'll have to shoot you too kid. Of course, we'd be willing to make a deal about the reward money. That's about far enough. I got a gun aimed right at your belt buckle. - He's bluffing. - I reckon. And he's defending Flood, which means he's going against the law. Get him. Put it on the bar. Now finish that quiet drink of yours. Why don't you just shoot him and let's get on with the party? Let's get out of here. You get any idea about following us, forget it. I'll untie Flood and give him a gun. That was an interesting break in the monotony last night. You only had the sense to take my advice, we'd still be there. Little girl who kept eying you was kind of pretty. - There's one I like better back in Buckley. - No reason not to like them all. Maybe if I get to stay in Buckley long enough, I'll meet her. See if I approve. - You'll have plenty of time. - No. You keep forgetting. I said I'm not going to jail. You know, we never did get those supplies. All we need is some meat and flour and some horseshoe nails. - We can make do. - What about cigars? Well, is a tragedy I can't even stand thinking about. The problem is we're headed toward the Pecos country over toward Devil's River. Not many towns there I'm on friendly terms with. I'm glad to hear that. You know Jonesy, you'd brave as a lion, holding off them bounty hunters. Maybe we can get the supplies we need from them. I'd give my right arm for a cigar. - Afternoon. - What do you want? We need some supplies, if you let us have them. - Like what? - Hey, that's Jim Flood. Sure it is, I've seen him in El Paso. I'm taking him in, we don't want any trouble, just some supplies. That's the man Jake Hanley and his bunch was looking for... and he'll pay plenty to lay his hands on him. - I said I'm taking him in. - Sure son. Hanley pay half a year's wages for him and he's tied up. Shut up. This man is the law and we ain't going against the law. Now that we've got that settled... what we need is flour and beans and horseshoe nails if you could spare them. Get him some Joe. Get out of here. Hey, look at this. Seven, when I pass on to glory, my one wish will be to go with a pocket full of cigars. Where I'm going there'll be no problem lighting them. Hey, who is that Jake Hanley they were talking about? Hanley? Him and his friends are undoubtedly the meanest... bunch of gunslingers in the entire Southwest. And you, a Ranger, never heard of him? What he got against you? All sorts of things too numerous to mention. Had a dispute with some of his brothers one time, for instance. They the same Hanleys you shot back at Beeker's Crossing? Yeah. No wonder he's out to get you. They're just one, big, mean family and Jake is the last of them. We may as well help ourselves to the stuff we need. That's the way I like to hear you talk. You know, you'd make a fair to middle badman if you ever gave yourself half the chance. You ever think about it? - About what? - Being an outlaw. Having the sheer pleasure of throwing in with me. Together we could pick up the entire Southwest and shake it like a pair of dice. Come up with a lucky seven every time. No, never thought about it. Well, think about it. Hey, look at this, some bacon. Those peaks are starting to look familiar. We ought to be in Buckley about tomorrow night, I'd say. - We make it to Buckley. - Eh? Look Seven, if we run into that Hanley bunch, don't try too hard to hold on to me. - Hanley? - Yeah. Let him take me Seven. No use of us both getting killed, get out of the way. I'm not standing by and let you get shot, you're my prisoner. Don't do it. Let's not have a big fracas. I'll just go along with you fellows. - Good. - Nobody is taking him Hanley. Better get out of here kid. Hey Jonesy. Thanks. - Buckley, eh? - Yeap. You made it Seven. Now I kind of like to get out of here without hurting you. Don't worry about it. It's Flood. That's Flood. Get down. Lieutenant, this here is Jim Flood. Lieutenant, seems to me we met someplace. - Fogarty, lock him up. - I'll see you later Seven. All right Jones. - Jones. - Yes sir? Write up a report. I want details on Hennessy and bringing in Flood. Give it to me in the morning. Here, I'll take them Seven. Boy, that sure was something, bringing in Jim Flood. Yeah. Seven. - Hello. - You look tired. - I am a little. - Can I fix you some coffee? I'd like that. Let's see now, after I left Beeker's Crossing... All right Fred, you've got your story, that's enough for tonight. You shouldn't have thrown that newspaper fella out. I could have held him... spellbound for another hour or so. But then doubtless, you wanted to have a word with me in private, eh? I got nothing to say to you. The service here is deplorable. You save hanging money by letting your prisoners starve? Supper will be brought. Only I had a better memory... I'm sure I've seen that distinguished face of yours. Yeah. Yeah, it's coming to me now a little more clear. It happened last year. Had something to do with a loop... or a curve or a twist, yeah. That's it, a bend. That's it, the Big Bend country. Seems to me the fella you remind me of was sitting behind a rock. You spend much time sitting behind rocks, lieutenant? Talk like that can get you hurt. In case you hadn't thought of it lieutenant, it can also get you hurt. I doubt if anyone is going to be fonder of you when they find out that... you deserted a Ranger named Two Jones last year, let him get killed. Killed by you. My guess is that you sent Seven after me hoping I'd kill him too. With Seven Jones out of the way, you could forget the whole Jones... family, maybe even forget what a coward you are. Nobody ever believe you, telling a story like that. No? The only way to find out is to tell it. You going to be at the end of a rope one way or the other, what are you after? Sometimes I just get a calling to even things out for a friend. You're dead set on pushing your luck, aren't you? That's right. I'm going to let you out of here. Well, that's sure neighborly of you. You got a reputation for breaking jail. You're going to try a break now. I don't know, that doesn't seem quite honest. Step out of the cell. Lieutenant, before you shoot, you mind if I have another puff or two? Well, I better get started with the dishes. Was a good meal, doubt even Flood could've done better than that. Flood, I'd like to know more about him, you seem to like him. - He's kind of a hard man to tell about. - I wish you'd try. Well, seems almost impossible to explain but... I trust him more than any man I know, with anything I had. And at the same time know he might turn on me any minute. What is it makes you feel that way about him? Flood is whatever a man kind of wants to be, I guess. Wild and free as a bird. As free as the hawk that tried to kill my puppy? Well... - I don't think you understand what I... - Free enough to kill Hennessy? Yahoo, see you later Seven. Get the doctor. She'll be fine. Shock is what does it when you're hit like that. I don't suppose you'd have a cup of hot coffee, would you Mary? Why certainly, in the kitchen, I'll get it for you. You ought to get some sleep. Flood. Took me a little while to shake the Rangers. I figured it take you about this long. - Going to do you a big favor. - What's that? Going to give you one last chance to come along with me. You know Seven, you and I hit it off like nobody is business. That's right, we did. Well, come on then. We'll have us a great time. No, I got to stop you Flood. You don't think you're going to put me in that jail again? I'm going to try. What's bothering you? You're awful serious. You remember firing a shot near this house when you rode out of town? - Yeah. - Well, you hit a girl. A girl you never even knew, you could've killed her. - Oh, I'm sorry. - You still could've killed her. A man just can't do the things you do. Look Seven, we can do things that nobody is ever dreamed of, come on. No. You know as well as I do that you can't stop me. - I'll do my best. - Why? Because of Hennessy, that girl, all the others. It's not enough just to be sorry Flood. For all I know, the man who killed my brother might've been sorry, but it didn't help. Yeah. Well, so long Seven. I got to stop you Jim, turn around. When I first met you, you were pretty clumsy, you've been improving. I never knew you to be so slow. I didn't expect you to miss like that. At the last minute there, I remembered you owed me $86. Couldn't stand to lose that gambling debt. Yeah.
