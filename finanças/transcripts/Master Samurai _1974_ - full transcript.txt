(tense music) (gunshots blasting) (lively music) (mumbling) - [Peterson] Will you take me to the Hyatt Hotel? - [Driver] Aye. - [Peterson] Thank you. (lively music) - [Man] Welcome, sir. - [Peterson] Thank you. - Drive on. - Are you sure that was him? - I've seen him twice. Once in Bangkok. Once in Rangoon. - It could be he's interested in the same line of business we are. Anyway, I'm totally sure. I don't think he'll be a problem. (mumbling) bothered. - You think he can help, maybe? - I don't know. - You think he'll lead us to something? - Well, his record showing something pretty impressive. If he was playing, he won't take it sitting down. - That's true. - [Benigno] You keep an eye on him and see what he'll do next. (phone ringing) - Hello? Who? Yeah, okay. Hey, Bruno. Boy, you boys are on the ball. I haven't been in town an hour and, sure I always have time to talk to an old friend, but, hey, now wait a minute. I'm no longer with... Where? Yeah, I think I know the place, but... (uptempo party music) Hello, Bruno. - [Bruno] Hi. - Bring me a glass, please. - Yes, sir. - [Bruno] Are you clear? - No one followed me. I came the long way around. Now, what's up? - A hot piece of info goin' around. I knew sooner or later the agency would send someone in. But I didn't know it'd be you. - Bruno, that's what I was trying to tell you on the phone. I'm no longer with the agency. I'm a private detective working for a worldwide organization. - Why? What happened? - Overzealous. There was this dope-pushing bastard that had moved to this trade with the ghetto people and middle class schoolkids. You ever see a 14 year old girl who's been popping quartz? He was arrested several times but never convicted. Big friends, big money. So, I convicted him. Right between the eyes. Washington asked me to leave the service. - So, what are you doing here in Manila? - You read about that three million dollar kidnapping in Chicago by the People's Liberation Army? - Yeah. - That's what it's all about. The People's Liberation Army is a front for the organization. We got a lead the money's around here. Since I knew the area, they sent me. Hey, what's the matter? - My people are on the same thing. - What? - Listen, that's what this hot tip is all about. The guys around here are all excited about a big operation. Big, I tell you. There's talk of foreign financing and all that. - You in on it? - In a way, yes, but I haven't got the whole thing on it. - Thank you. (melancholy music) If you're in, why are you telling me? - They're into narcotics. You know I'm against that. It killed my brother. - Yeah, sure, I know. - Look, I used to be a smuggler and a gun runner, but that is all over now. - Okay, go on. - Let me look around. All I know is, there's a tie up involving a big-time politician and components. (melancholy music) - This is one of the suspects in the kidnapping. Have you seen him? - No, I've not seen him. You better leave. - What's the matter? - Later, you go out the front door. I'll go this way. (tense beat music) - Ah, ah! (thudding) (grunting) (tense beat music) (thudding) (grunting) (engine rumbling) (groaning) (mumbling) - [Peterson] Good morning. Is Major Javier in? - [Receptionist] Yes, sir. - [Major] Come on in. - [Peterson] Good morning, Major. My name's Peterson. - [Major] How are you, Mr. Peterson? Please, sit down. - [Peterson] Thank you. - [Major] Can we be of any help, perhaps? - What have you found out about this Bruno's killing? - Ah, yes. Hmm. Quite interesting. A petty hoodlum dies and the very next morning, I find an American gentleman in my office interested in him. - I knew him, that's all. - That's a nice one. We're also informed that Mr. Bruno was seen drinking with a certain foreigner last night. You weren't that foreigner, by any chance? - Yes, but I-- - And my I ask why you were with him? - Well, you see, I'm a businessman and Bruno was... (mumbling) find me a companion, whenever I came here to Manila. - I see. And you don't think he died accidentally? - No, I don't. - And you suspect that he was killed, right? - I don't know, except I never knew him to be a heavy drinker. Maybe, the woman business, competition. - Unlikely, Mr. Peterson. You see, Bruno wasn't really into that kind of a business. But I think you know all that. - Major, how would I know? I'm in import exports. - Tantos. - [Tantos] Sir? - Mr. Peterson is here in my office-- - [Tantos] Yes, sir. - About the Bruno case. Come on in. Take Mr. Peterson out and get a statement from him. (mumbling) - Come on, this way, please. - Import export. (chuckling) Why did they have to kill a character like Bruno just for talking to a foreigner like Peterson? - What I don't understand is, where does Peterson fit in? - Cable Washington for a dossier on him. - Yes, sir. - [Vargas] Mr. Peterson. - [Peterson] Yeah? - [Vargas] My name is Vargas. I wanna talk with you about Bruno. - I just gave my statement in there. Go read it. - I know, I know. But they won't show it to me. I'm a suspended cop, a detective. I owe him something. - Look, Vargas. I'm just a businessman, all right? - Peterson, I don't think you're just a businessman, and I doubt if Major Javier thinks so, either. He's probably cabling Washington right now to check you out. I'll know the answer an hour after he does. - Okay. Call me at my hotel this evening. We'll have a drink. (horns honking) (engine grumbling) - All right, but it's less fun. Only you could have pulled off that caper in Taipei. - Look, Bill, I need a favor, just for old times' sake, okay? - Sure, anything. What can I do to help? - You know why I'm here? - I know. Three million reasons why you're here. What have you got? - Not much, just that somehow, Manila got into the picture. Then last night, this guy I was drinking with got killed. - Ah, Bruno, right. The guy who was helping you with those commies. (chuckling) - I'm beginning to think you're way ahead of me. All right, what have you got? - We're trying to put the pieces together, but all we have so far, it's not very much, is that a big syndicate got thrown out of Monte del Fuego. - How? - Uncle Sam tried to put the dollar squeeze on them, but no go. Finally, the group of Admiral Hernandez staged a coup. - And then what happened? - Well, it seems the coup caught everyone by surprise. The Admiral's boys got everything. They syndicate funds, everything except for the top two or three. So, the syndicate still has its head intact. - What happened next? - That's where your three million bucks come in. The syndicate needed replenishment of capital, so they pulled that phony political kidnapping and started looking around for a new base. Ah, thank you. - Well, that makes sense so far. Oh, thank you. But why Manila? Man, there's Marshall Law here. - They're brave little bastards, aren't they? (mumbling) First thing the new government did is execute a Chinese dopehead and I guess that kind of false security the syndicate finds useful. - Don't like it, but it makes sense. I don't understand. How can they operate? - They'll find a front man, like an ex-politician who still has good contacts. It's not a big step from the old politics to syndicate crime and dope is profitable enough to justify risks. - Yeah. Bruno told me the same thing. Incidentally, do you have anything on a Sergeant Vargas, a detective? - Sergeant Vargas, name's familiar. Let's see, let's see here. That one's recent. Here it is, got suspended. Said he was framed. - Said he wants to talk to me. Why not, okay. Well. Guess I better be going. - Dang glad to be of help to an alumnus. - Hey, can't you do something about this import export thing? Everybody sees through it. - Well, I tried to recommend a brothel in the front one. Nearly got kicked out. - And that's my story. (melancholy music) Peterson, you see that one, that framed me, (mumbling) for I'd been promised a lot of money. See, I just wanna clear myself. And now Bruno is dead. He could have tied up the loose ends. - Yeah, yeah I know. - What brings you here? - It started late last year in Chicago with a kidnapping by the People's Liberation Army. There's a three million dollar ransom. My company was hired to recover the ransom. Trail led me here. (melancholy music) (mumbling) And that's how it is. What's your next move? - Well, what do you think I should do? - We'll team up. It'll make things easier for me if I could use your contacts, besides, for the way they handled Bruno, I could use some backup. - [Man] Welcome. (chuckling) Yes, it's good to see you again. (speaking foreign language) - How do you do? (melancholy music) - Who's the chick? - She's Cecile LaFanta. One of our society girls. - Who's with her? Her lover? - No, Don Benigno. He was a top politician before Marshall Law. - Marshall Law hasn't changed his style of living. - Well, Don Benigno apparently made it a long time ago. - Well, unless you're going to run, she'll have to, she'll run for office now. Yeah, yeah. I think that's a good idea. - What are your plans now? - I'm not sure. - Maybe I can put you onto a new lead. - Like what? (mumbling) - Like this man needs followed. Like the man turtle. - We'll do that. You're on suspension. That means no income. - It's a little tight, but I'll manage. - You've got to move fast. Here. Take this. Hire a car and buy some information with it. - Oh, thank you, but... - Come on. It's not mine. Business expenses. - Okay, thank you. Waiter. Waiter! - [Waiter] Yes sir, thank you sir, thank you. - [Peterson] Thank you. (patrons chattering) - Okay, come in. - Subject is on his way out, we're following by car, over. (engines grumbling) (tense dramatic music) (crashing) (tense dramatic music) (engines grumbling) (engine zooming) (mumbling) (engine revving) (tense dramatic music) (crashing) (gunshots blasting) - [Thug] John, let's get outta here! (tense dramatic music) (engine grumbling) (tense music) - [Thug] Good evenin', Mr. Peterson. - Good evening. What's goin' on? - We're from the police, Mr. Peterson. We're searching your place. Been hearin' things about ya. - You have a search warrant? - We are under Marshall Law. Haven't you heard? - I heard the people still have-- aren't you curious about what happened to your pals tonight? (chuckling) (thudding) (grunting) (tense dramatic music) (gunshots blasting) - Come on! (gunshots blasting) (tense dramatic music) (groaning) (footsteps thudding) (engine rumbling) (chattering) (tense music) - [Vargas] Oh. - Oh. - Hello. Could I stay awhile here? - Do you want a massage? (slow tempo romantic music) - Oh. Massage? Sure. Sure. - I give a good massage. (slow tempo romantic music) - You know Bruno? - [Masseuse] I'm sorry sir, I don't know anybody by that name. - How 'bout Turko? Is he here? - Don't know him. - Well, he brought me here. Does he own the place? - I can see my work here. (tense music) - Hey, buddy. We've been hearin' things about you. So, you're the inquisitive fellow? Why do you work? - I was just playin' with her. Tryin' to make time while she massaged me. - You want massage, huh? Let me do it for you. (thudding) (grunting) (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) (woman shrieking) (thudding) (grunting) (uptempo tense music) (thudding) (grunting) (engine rumbling) - Hold it. Who the hell are you? You been trailing me for a couple of days now. - What's the matter? You don't want my help? - That's just it. Why did you help? - Let's go someplace where we can talk this over. - Okay. Okay. So, you're from MI-5 Special Force out of Hong Kong. - Yes. - But why always following me about? Why didn't you go to the police or MBI? - Look, all we have to go on are tips. I can't go to your metric armor MBI saying fellas check out this (mumbling). Very unprofessional. So, I decided to start with you. I thought you'd lead us to something while you were trying to kill yourself on that pusher (mumbling). By the way, how 'bout the American man, Peterson? - He's also chasing down rumors. It appears we're all in the same boat. - It sure looks that way, all right. Well, now. I can concentrate on the Chinese angle. We heard that some local Chinese businessmen are tied up with the drugs, but they're only a part of the picture. - The operation's really big. International, if I'm right. My problem is I tend to find the main local contacts. At present, I don't have any leads. - [Singh] Well, so far, that's all that we've got. - Gentlemen. I'm glad you accepted my invitation. - How could we refuse when the invitation was delivered by uniformed cop? - I hope you'll excuse that touch, but I think the situation has become urgent. Now, Mr. Peterson. For a man in the import export business, the only trading you've seem to have accomplished so far is trading punches and bullets. And as far as you're concerned, Mr. Singh, you claim to be a tourism developer from Hong Kong, but your only investments made so far have been some Kung Fu kicks here and there. - Well, sir, I-- - And as for you, suspension doesn't seem good enough. Maybe I'll hang you. All right. What's goin' on? - By now, Major, you know who I am. - Yes, Washington was very helpful. But Hong Kong was a little vague about you, which means you probably are working for Her Majesty's Secret Service. Now, don't you guys know you're supposed to cooperate with the police forces in the countries you're operating in? - We will let you know once we get something definite. - We're competent investigators, here, Mr. Singh. You know that. We're professionals and we'd do anything and that includes running down rumors. - Oh, we know that, sir, but too much activity might tip them off. - Suppose you let us worry about that. Now, get this and get this good. You hear anything, you better let us know, or else. - Say no more, Major. We got the message. (tense music) (dramatic tense music) (yelling) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) (crashing) - Hello? - [Man On Phone] General. - What? - [Man On Phone] We've just been raided! - This is the second time that place has been raided. Okay. You just lie low for a while. - If we killed violence we wouldn't have this problem. - I don't know what's happening here. (phone ringing) Yes, Turko. - [Man On Phone] We've been raided again! - Again? - [Man On Phone] Yeah, again. Everything's a disaster. 15 were up again, including four of our men. What do we do now? - I'll handle it. Know any of our men being arrested? We might remember Royce. - [Vargas] Hi, Turko. Send your boys out. I wanna talk to you. - Now, what do you want? All of my drugs been raided. All because of you. - No, Turko, it's you, when you killed Bruno. - You must be crazy. - Cut out the dramatics. I know your style. I have no evidence, but between us, you had him killed, didn't you? - You, a suspended cop? Ha ha, don't make me laugh Vargas. You have no more authority than I do, and you know it. - You and your friend have something to do with that. - I think it's time you and your friend left. (thudding) (grunting) (dramatic uptempo music) (thudding) (grunting) (crashing) (thudding) (grunting) (crashing) (thudding) (grunting) (dramatic uptempo music) (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) (tense uptempo music) (thudding) (grunting) - My friend Vargas tells me you know who had Bruno killed. (grunting) That's what you're about to do. - No, no. Don't push, don't. Don't, don't. It was me, I'll tell ya, it was me. - Why? - Well, they decided he was always in the way. Because of what happened to his brother, his kid brother. - Why'd they frame Vargas? (grunting) Now for the big question. Who's number one? - No, no. I can't tell you that. They'll kill me for sure. They'll kill if I talk. - That's a possibility, Turko. But if you don't tell me... (gunshot popping) (grunting) (slow tempo jazzy music) - Oh, Amy, if anyone calls for me, I'll be at home, okay? - [Amy] Yes, ma'am. - Thanks. (engine rumbling) (horn honking) - [Benigno] Okay, well everything is all set. Good, good. Now, if you need anything more, don't hesitate to call. Right, speak to you then. - [Cecile] Something wrong, Dad? - No, nothing. I just want to be sure that everything is all set for George's arrival. (mumbling) What I can't figure out is what kind of business he's got in mind. He's been in and out of the country so many times for several months, now. I'm beginning to wonder whether it's really a business or you he's interested in. - Oh, Dad, cut it out. - Cecile, I think he's fallen for you. - I don't care, Dad. He seems to be so, so cold blooded. - Well, you know how it is in business. Sometimes you have to be cold blooded or even ruthless, otherwise, competition will eat you up. (murmuring) - He's coming tomorrow. - Yes, I know he is and with his associates. (chattering) (mumbling) - [Waiter] Your paper, sir. - Thank you. (chattering) - [Waiter] Here you are. - Thank you. (chattering) (dramatic music) - So, Jensen planned it. - He's the first definite link we've had between the kidnapping and the trail to Manila. - Who is this George Pomeroy who's leadin' the group? - Sounds familiar. I've come across his name. He's an old business partner of Don Benigno LaFanta. I think he's been here before. - Well, send traces to Washington anonymously. - Already done, Vargas. Meanwhile, let's dig deeper into the business deals of Don Benigno LaFanta. Put the whole bunch under surveillance. - [Peterson] I can tail those two Chinese fellows. - [Major] I suppose you don't know anything about Turko's death? - Officially, not a damn thing. Unofficially, if we can find the three men and start breaking the drug trade, then we can find Turko's killer. - Says in the paper that Don Benigno's giving a big welcome party tonight. Maybe I can attend. Who knows? Perhaps I can find something interesting. - So you have an invitation? - No. But I have a friend in the trading business who has contacts here. I think he can get me an invitation. - Your friend Mr. Daniels, I presume. Import export, huh? (chattering) (melancholy music) - I hope you're enjoying yourself. Is everything to your satisfaction? Good, good, have a nice night. (melancholy music) (chattering) - Here she comes. Make yourself at home, won't you? Excuse me for just a moment. (chattering) Well, gentlemen, are you all being taken care of? - Excuse me, excuse me. - I'm Cecile LaFanta, your hostess. Won't you come in? - Thank you. (slow tempo romantic music) - Well, Mr. Peterson. What's your line of business? - Import exports. Right now I'm interested in building (mumbling). - Oh, how interesting. We produce those things, you know. As a matter of fact, Father owns a cement factory. - I know. - Oh, excuse me for a moment. (chattering) (slow tempo romantic music) - [Peterson] Hail, hail, the gang's all here. - What the hell do we care? (mumbling) (chattering) - Benigno. Go away. (slow tempo romantic music) - [Benigno] I thought all the invitations were screened. - [George] Yes, they were, I assure you. - Then what's that bastard, Peterson, doing here? - Peterson? Who's Peterson? - He was the man assigned to investigate the kidnapping job. Now, I'd like to remind me you that you no longer run in that two bit political organization. I don't know what's happenin' around here, but all we've left are these punks from pussy-- - Give me a little time, I-- (mumbling) - There's a lot to see. - Right, I'll show you around. Well, the cutting section's over there. Come on, you don't really want to see my father's plant, do you? - Nope. Come on, let's get outta here. (engine rumbling) (slow tempo romantic music) - All right, then. - All right. - Let's go. (slow tempo romantic music) (engine rumbling) Well, do you like it? - Not bad. Pretty good. (slow tempo romantic music) - That's the tall volcano down there. (slow tempo romantic music) (water rushing) (tense music) (gunshots blasting) - [Peterson] Get down. (tense music) Keep your head down. (gunshots blasting) We have to paddle. (gunshots blasting) (mumbling) keep going. (slow tempo tense music) (gunshots blasting) (yelling) (splashing) (tense beat music) (gunshots blasting) Are you all right? - I'm fine. Who were they? What did they want? - I don't know. Maybe river pirates. The important thing is that I scared them off and that you are safe. (lively music) (engines rumbling) - Bastard. Watch that footage, come on. (lively music) (tires squealing) Faster, come on! (crashing) (engine rumbling) - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (engine rumbling) - [Cecile] Oh, Daddy. Oh, it was awful. It was awful. - What happened? - [Cecile] We went down to (mumbling) and there were these guys, they started firing shots at us and they tried to drive us off the road. They just kept shooting at us. - Wait a minute. Just calm down and relax. - [Cecile] I'm sorry. - Does anybody know who these guys were? What they were after? - No. Peterson said they were the river pirates, that they're after his money. - That's all? - Yes. But why? - It doesn't matter. Look, Angel, I care a lot about ya. It's not important just so long as you're okay. - Please, George, not now. - You better get some rest. (lively music) - Look, darling, I said just one more. - [Alona] Okay, just one. - Good. (lively music) Hey, hey, Peterson, import export, right? - Yeah, right. Sorry, I don't remember your name. - Jensen, fine cars. - Oh, yeah, right, yeah, yeah. This your wife? - Yeah, I'd like to meet uh, what's your name, honey? - [Alona] Alona. - Oh, Alona, I'd like you to meet my friend, Peterson. You got a friend for Peterson? - [Alona] Sure, I got plenty friends. - Not tonight, Alona. Some other time, maybe. - All right, this is Manila, buddy. Everybody has fun here. Say, I got an idea. Let's use this and have some fun. - What's this? - I got it from a friend. What do you say? - Can't get in without this? - Right. For the security conscious. You need a special friend to get one of these things. - Look, I'm tied up tonight. How about you be my reference and get me one of those? We'll go tomorrow. - See what I can do. But me, I'm not waiting for tomorrow, baby. I'm gonna have me a wing-ding tonight with this here little, uh, what was your name again, honey? - I guess that's the time. Don Benigno is about to lose it all. And Pomeroy and his syndicate are willing to bail him out, if he can provide the local front for the operation. - Bastards. - Has it gone far between you and Cecile? - Oh, I almost forgot. Have the lab make up another one like this. (slow tempo music) - What is it? - A friend gave it to me. It could be our first real break. You ever hear of this place? - No, I haven't. - We'll go there tonight. - Fine with me. (slow tempo ethnic music) (hooves clomping) (crashing) (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) (buzzing) - Good evening, sir. The card, please. - Oh. (chuckling) - Okay, go ahead. (uptempo music) (chattering) (tense music) (moaning) (tense music) - [Jensen] This is where the foyer will be, of course and the we'll uh... (Vargas groaning) - Mr. Jensen, we caught this guy snooping around outside. What should we do? - Okay. Take him downstairs and lean on him a little. Find out what he knows, then make sure he forgets it. - [Thug] Come on. (tense music) (mumbling) - [George] Find out what's going on. (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) (crashing) (gunshots blasting) (yelling) (tense music) Goddammit, Jim. What kind of idiots did you import? - They were the best. - The whole setup is in a shambles, all because of a has-been C.I.A. agent, a suspended Filipino cop, and a Chinese flatfoot. - Forget 'em, George. - Forget it. This country was a bad choice. Don Benigno's lost his nerve. He's no good anymore. We're pullin' out. - Pullin' out? - That's right. The sooner the better. I'll contact Chan in Malaysia. We'll be safe there until we can check out a new base in Asia. - What about the money? - We take it with us. - I've got it all lined up. Now, keep quiet, all of you, while I talk to her. (phone ringing) - [Cecile] Hello? - Cecile, George here. - George. It's quite late. Something wrong? - Nothing's wrong. I have to leave the country for a few days and I'd like to see you before I go. How 'bout comin' out on the boat with me tomorrow? - Tomorrow? Well, I don't know. I'm not sure. - Aw, come on, Cecile. It'll be quite a while before I can see you again. - All right. Okay. - Good, I'll see you about 9:30, okay? - All right. - So, this is what we will do. First, get the boat ready for tomorrow. - Aye. Ready. - [Cecile] Oh, business again? - No, not for me. They're here to see your father. - [Cecile] This early, George? - Shall we go? We'll be home early. - [Cecile] Goodbye, Dad. - [Benigno] All right, gentlemen. Now, what's on your mind? - It's Peterson. He's getting to be a problem. - What do you intend to do about it? (chuckling) - Let's talk to him. - Talk to him? Well, what about? - Every man has his price, Don Benigno. - That just won't work on Peterson. He can't be bought. - We can at least try. Call him up and tell him to come over. - Are you ordering me? (chuckling) - No, we're not at all. Let's just call it friendly persuasion from Mr. George Pomeroy. (phone ringing) - Yes? - Hello, Mr. Peterson. This is Don Benigno LaFanta. - Good morning. - I'd like to talk to you, about business. Is that all right? - When? - Right now, if it's not inconvenient for you. I shall be waiting for you at my house. Very good. (phone ringing) - Yeah? What's up? - Don Benigno just called. He wants me to go to his house. I think it's a set up after what happened last night. First of all, I want you and Vargas to see if you can get hold of a couple of motorcycles. - Yeah, okay. (engine rumbling) (uptempo tense music) - [Benigno] A meeting of all things. You said we'd just talk with Peterson. - We don't trust that guy. We're just playin' it safe. - [Benigno] Now look, I told you I don't want any trouble here - [Thug] Shut up! (mumbling) - You paged my name! - Cut out the bullshit, old man. Too late for anything else. (engine rumbling) - He's coming! (uptempo jazzy music) (engines zooming) - Peterson, you get out! It's a trap! (gunshot popping) (crashing) (gunshots blasting) (tense music) I'm sorry. They have Cecile. - Who? - With Pomeroy. At the yacht club. - Why the yacht club? - I don't know. They might go there to my resort by the beach. Take care of her. (tense music) (gunshots blasting) (yelling) (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) (yelling) - [Peterson] The yacht club, let's go. - Okay. (thudding) (grunting) What did you do that for? - [Singh] Why the hell not? (tense music) (mumbling) - Tied up in traffic. Don't worry, they'll be here. - That's all right. But I thought you wanted to relax. You're all worked up, you know. - You know me, dear. I don't like waiting. Would you like another drink? - All right. Thanks. - [Thug] Hey boss. - [George] What is it? How's it goin'? - They're comin' over. Don Benigno fouled up everything. - [George] Now, wait a minute, all right? Let's start from the beginning. - [Thug] Peterson, Vargas and that chink agent came in. I got the hell out just in time. - What about Don Benigno? - He got shot. - What? My father got shot? Oh! Let me go! (grunting) (thudding) (engines zooming) (footsteps clunking) - That son of a bitch. I bet they're heading to Don Benigno's resort. - Now what? - We'll go after 'em. - How? - How else? We'll borrow a speedboat. - Singh and I will go by land and cut off any escape. - Okay. - Hey. Be careful. (engines zooming) - Listen, Jensen. There might be trouble ahead. Everything's gone wrong, they got away, that's all. - What happened? - [George] Never mind, just alert the boys to be on the lookout. - Okay.
