Myself Rahul. I am 40 years old. Normally at this age in one's life there comes a big twist. I also experienced something big. I mean, really big. One that changed my life. Actually let's start at the very beginning. Since I was a kid I have been living in this house with my... grandfather, grandmother, mother and father. My parents passed away when I was eight years old... My grandparents took care of me. When I was a child it was quite obvious that I was rather cute. People would pull my cheeks and say... So Sweet! And this sweetness was in my grandfathers' shop. Y. Y. Mithaiwala (Sweet Seller). In Mumbai, the outlets of our shop, surpassed the greenery. Brother, please pack six samosas and half a kilo of the fried sweet. Brother!!?? Why? Why? Mithaiwala!! And my grandfather would also interfere in my love life... at times he would call... and at times he himself would show up in person in person. I never got the chance to be in a relationship... and clearly marriage was out of the question. Six, six!! Rahul, did you see the way Sachin plays! Wow!! Though my grandfather was a die hard fan of Sachin Tendulkar... he never applied the word 'die' in his life. Time passed on but he did not. All my relatives settled abroad. And then came 2013. My grandfathers' 100th birthday! Apart from my grandfather I have two more tragedies in my life... my friends Bobby and Salim. Hi Rahul. Hi. All set for Goa? Goa? Once you reach there don't be naughty at forty huh! And both of you, mind your own business! Tanu, can you just help me for a minute here? What is this new story you two have been cooking? Not just the two, this includes all of us. Rahul, it's grandpa's birthday but the gift is for you. Hot NRI women! I've already spoken to them. In Goa we will be with them for a 6 days - 7 nights fixed package! What sort of friends are you? One week! How will grandpa let me go for a week? Just a minute. He's an idiot! - But you are also an idiot! - Rahul... Come here. Grandpa. Sir, you come with me. Yes, grandpa. Yes, you brought me a gift didn't you? You haven't yet opened the gifts given by Vimal, Renu and the others.. They are others, not 'ours'. I am going to be a 100. I will say very important things. They only like me because we're related. You love me which is why we are related! I wonder what will happen to you once pass on. Grandpa... Here we go! I've also begun to talk about leaving... it's hardly my age to talk of leaving... Why do we talk about what is to happen 20 to 25 years later. Come on, give it to me. Yes. Wow! A bat autographed by Sachin! Come on, hit! It was Rahul's idea to open a franchise of your shop in Goa. Yes go ahead and open it. Why are you wasting your time here? Grandpa, we have already seen an amazing land plot in Panjim. We are going with Rahul to finalize the plot. Go. Oh come on, Sachin, hit it beyond the boundary! Six! Sachin is on 99. Sachin is on 99!! Sachin is on 99!! What grandma? So much excitement for a century. It's just a game. He will make it again. Grandpa! Both grandpa and Sachin were knocked out at 99! It was a strange feeling. But then I read somewhere that... a person's death is already predestined before his birth. I thought to myself if what has to... happen has already happened what difference does it make? After all grandpa was alive... since the invention of all India radio to the advent of Twitter. He lived a good life. That's it! At that very moment... I had made a decision. Goa is on! Grandma, I want to do something more in life. I want to do something my heart tells me to do. I cannot handle Y. Y. Mithaiwala now. Grandma, even I have some dreams. Till now I've just let my age catch on. But now I want to see the world and learn things. Grandma, I really want to live life on my own terms. Rahul, with the property you've already begun to live life on your own terms. Live your life the way you want to, nobody is stopping you. But you will have to do me a favor. Yes tell me, grandma. It was your grandfather's last wish... that after he died... half of his ashes would be immersed into the Ganga... and the other half in Rameshwaram. Rameshwaram? Yes. I will go along with Anshu and immerse his ashes into the Ganga... but you will have to go to Rameshwaram to pour out the other half of his ashes. Grandma, me? Yes, you! This was your grandfather's last wish, you will have to fulfil it. This Rameshwaram is at the end of India! That too in the exact opposite direction as Goa! One minute guys! Salim, give me that. The waters of Goa must be flowing up to Rameshwaram, right? What do you mean? What he means is that if we pour out Grandpa's ashes in the waters of Goa... It will eventually float and reach Rameshwaram. Yes, but Goa and Rameshwaramare miles away. Oh, we are going to make them coincide.. What does that mean? Goa is on! Yes, Rahul. Bobby, change of plan. What? You're coming to Goa right? Of course, I'm coming. But to fool grandma we have to begin our journey by train. What? Grandma is going to come to see me off. So in the next two hours I will buy a ticket to any train going to South India. I will get on the train, and I will get off at the Kalyan station. You guys wait for me there, we will travel by road from there. Which means, Goa is on! Let's go, grandpa. Chennai Express? Yes, Chennai Express. As much as I know, I don't think Chennai Express goes to Rameshwaram. You did not understand. Didn't I tell you that I want to spend more time with grandpa? So I am taking the long route not the wrong route. I will get off at Chennai and take the road to Rameshwaram. Rahul... do you know why I am taking your grandpa's ashes to the Ganga? It's because I don't trust anyone here. But I have complete faith... that you will immerse your grandpa's ashes... with most sincerity in the waters of Rameshwaram. I did not like lying to grandma one bit. But by then, I had already done that. Hello. Rahul, where are you, man? We have already reached Kalyan. Yes, I'm already in the train after bidding farewell to Grandma. I will be reaching shortly. Rahul's arrived. Rahul, where were you? I've come, right? - Now it's going to be fun! - Yes!! - Ash! - What happened now? The ashes! Granpa's ash! No Rahul... No. - Granpa! - Rahul, listen to us! Thanks. No, It's okay. I've done this before. Actually I've. Sorry I should go. Meenamma, what did you think? That you could get away from us? What you are doing is totally wrong! Don't try to preach to us. Excuse me. What are you guys fighting about? People miss catching trains, because of you people I missed my platform. Hi! Meenama. It's all right. Hi. That's my seat. My seat - um. May I? Thank you. Sorry! Sorry to you, sir. One second... Take it out... nonsense. I am sorry. I am a little fat. It's mine. Hello. Rahul, where are you? I am in the train. In the train? I didn't have the chance to get out. So, this is what we are going to do... we will meet at Karjat Station. And listen... don't worry about me... I've got great company. You found her, huh? Yes, she is sitting right in front of me. What hair! What amazing eyes! What lips! You are naming parts of her body in front of her... does she not have her sandals on? She doesn't understand Hindi. Hey wait, she's looking at me. She's probably looking at me with love. Make sure you check she's not blind. Shut up man. But its possible that she may get blinded by my love. Okay listen, lets meet at Karjat Station na... till then I will keep myself busy here. Hopefully, I should be able to get her along. When I saw you I knew my dear... that love is crazy my dear... Now where do I go... What makes you think don't understand Hindi? The ones who you helped are here to kidnap me. Kidnap? I'm in big trouble. So will you help me? So that they don't suspect anything... talk to me through songs. Grant me forgiveness, for I have wronged you. I had no idea you knew the language. I will do as you say now. Since I've made a mistake, I should pay the penalty. Hi... Don't you worry! I am here! Meenamma. You sing. So you go to... go to the toilet. So you go to... you go to the toilet. Toilet... but why are you sending me to the toilet? What is it that you intend to do, tell me? Your... I will use your phone to make a call. I will inform my friends. Toilet toilet... go to the toilet. Toilet! Call! Nature's call. Hello, Nature? I am calling... How are you? Rahul... you must not have heard the name before. Phone. Nokia Lumia 920. Advanced floating lens technology. Fat boy pillow recharge. Wireless recharging docking station. High quality audio in retro styling. Rupees 34,249. Can I make a call from this? Of course, you can. Meenamma, what did you think... You would call and we wouldn't notice? What the heck? That was my phone. My friends are waiting for me at the Karjat Station, how will I contact them? 35,000 rupee phone! Okay... 34,249. I will sue you! That was my phone, my phone! Meenamma, what is he saying? It was his phone. If I knew that earlier... I would have thrown him out with the phone. What pai pai is he doing? He's saying had they known the phone belonged to you... they would throw you out with the phone. Oh really? Is this your father's kingdom? Are you trying to scare me? Are you threatening me? I will show you! Meenamma! Enough! This is too much. You have made me so angry that I will sit down. And if I sit down don't think I won't be able to stand up again. And if I stand up don't think... I cannot sit down again. And I forgive you for the mobile too. I can buy out the entire mobile company if I want to. 4G, 5G, I have a lot of money. Poor people. Okay! Ticket. Brother, Ticket. No. What ille? no? Ticket No. If you don't have a ticket then you will have to pay a fine. I have my ticket. You call this a ticket. If you don't have a ticket then you will have to pay a fine. From where have you boarded the train? Are they with you? Listen to me very carefully TC... don't take it easy on these hooligans. Something is very, very fishy. Fishy? I swear all four of them are carrying long weapons. These four friends have abducted this girl and taking her very far away. Very carefully. Come on, get up. Come, come. Come on. Hey... song? Hey... song.. Now you will be in trouble. You can go to jail and play ping pong! You think you are King Kong? What aaa? Don't underestimate the power of a common man. And Meenamma, you are on my watch now. Now the TC is on our side... you see how he straightens them out. Enough! This is too much. You all have made me so angry that now I have to sit. You sing and dance. We are going by Chennai Express. You laugh and cry. We are going by Chennai Express. Meenamma? Whatever happened with the TC, you are the sol witness to it. That is why you will come with us to Komban village on Chennai Express. On Chennai Express! All my hearts wishes were washed away with these ashes. I had come to Goa to wash away the ashes but instead drowned the TC. My friends tried to get in touch with me. But they could not track me down because... my 35,000 rupee cell phone was lying somewhere on a train track.. Okay 34,249! I want to sleep. Okay... you sleep. Peﬂyanna, check on the next station. I am hungry. Okay. Meenamma... what is happening? I cannot understand a thing. You are scolding your kidnappers? And they are quietly listening to you? I'm confused! I will clear your confusion. Thank you. Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Meena Lochini Adhaghu Sundaram. Hello. Daughter of Durgeshwara Adhagh Sundaram. My father is a highly respected man in the Komban area. Good... He is a... you know periyathalai. Periyathalai... Teacher? No. Don! These four are listening to my pechi because... - Pechi? - Talk. Talk... pechi. So they were listening to me talk because they're my father's goons. Goons... goons? Yes but don't worry they are my cousin brother. Oh! It's like that. So mean okay! You can't do that. Sorry. My father had asked them to kidnap me and bring me back to Komban. Oh God! That means your father is the Godfather of the South. Yes. And he wants my Kalyanam to be done. Kal... You know marriage. Yes, Marriage. With Tangaballi. Tingabilla? What is Tingabilla? Yes, that is why I ran away! I didn't understand. Tangaballi is my father's friend's son. Okay. If I get married then my father will own his friend's village too. Okay. Then father will become double powerful. Good. That's why my father wants to get me married. I don't even want to get married. He just doesn't understand! Now did you understand the entire situations? No. No. This is your father, your goons, your marriage; what's my fault? The problem is also yours, kidnapping is also yours... that ppppaammbbb... kkambb village is also yours and it's my neck on the line? That means, what is yours is mine? No, Meenamma. People fly kites in the air, your goons throw mobiles and TCs in the air! I was quietly and happily going to Goa. Goa is on! But no! Take the Chennai Express. Huh? Now my whole... whole life is ruined! I am ruined! At night I thought of running away! When I opened my eyes in the morning... - Will you have an Idli? - No. Just need to go. - Will you eat? - No, just need to go. Why is he not eating Idlis? Inspector sir... Wake up... Inspector sir. I am being kidnapped. Kidnapped by 4 cousin brothers... Please come and catch them. They are criminals. Peﬂya. What officer... Did you hear the sound of this chicken? He said... Have you ever heard chickens? - Check, if there anything to eat? - Okay. Meenamma... that policeman instead of helping me, he... my father's reign begins from here. The policemen are helpless. What? What do you mean? It means that no one can do anything to these four. That means from here on anything can happen to me? Yes. That means I could even lose my life here? - Yes. - All you are saying is - yes! Do you know you should never tell a dying person that he's about to die. At least give me some sort of false hope that I will be saved. Okay. You can be saved. Feeling better? Feeling better! Now along with Grandpa's ashes my ashes will also be washed away. I don't know why I gave you my hand? You gave me your hand? In a bid to save myself I was running, why did you help those four? Had I known that your brothers were goons... I would have kicked them instead of helping them. Anyway, you are the root cause of this entire problem. Ever since you've come into my life, my life sucks! - What?- Sucks! - Same here. - Okay. Why have you come to me? You've come to my side. Forget about sides, Meenamma. Come to the point. Is there any way for the two of us to get out? Tell me, please! - Please! - Yes, there is. What is it? Please tell me... But you will have to do as I say. As if everything was going my way till now. I'll do it, tell me what has to be done? Once we reach Komban, in front of my father... whenever I look towards you, you just nod your head. Okay. Nod what? - Head. - What? - Head! - Okay. Nod my head. Nod my head. I will eat idlis, I will eat dosas, I will nod my head. I will eat dosas... I am okay... Take the Chennai express. Hey Chinna... We reached our village... come! Let's go. What are you doing? Meenamma, why did he pull the chain? When we arrive at my village we pull the chain. Don't worry, it's very common. The station begins from where we stand. Come on! Hey... move on! Who is this? Father. How many times will you try to escape! Why are you doing this? For what? I don't want to marry Tangaballi... Meena kept making her father understand, emotionally. Her father heard what Meena had to say. I am in love with somebody. Who is he? And I was... He. And I was as clueless as you all are. He loves me too. Am I right? The plan was to just nod my head. That is why... After such a reaction one thing was certain. In the future, I wouldn't be able to nod my head... because it would be cut off! My dear... Is Tamil your mother tongue? What is your father asking me about my mother? He's asking you if Tamil is your mother tongue? Appa, he settled in the North... I will teach him Tamil after our marriage. Meena likes this boy... bring him. Meenamma, I thought they were going to kill me... but your fathers goons lifted me up on their shoulders. Passing the parcel. Shoulder to shoulder. What did you say to them? I just told them three lies. You lied? At least tell me what you said? My first lie was that we are very much in love with each other. What? My second lie was that we wanted to get married to each other. What! That's when you nodded your head. Yes, I nodded. But that... So all of them have accepted this? No. The plan only worked when I told them the third lie. What was that? That you lived up north since you were a child which is why you don't know Tamil. He thought my story was genuine. So they've gone to the village to decide about our future. Not to decide on the future but to destroy my future. I am not going to be a part of this. Hey brother... Think about it Rahul, I will get married. - But that is my problem! - Go brother go. At first there were just four of them running after you... now the whole village will chase you. I did all this drama so we could buy some time. We will run away as soon as we get an opportunity at night. Run away... Don't worry, I have a lot of experience in running away. My family. Meena's small family reminded me of the population in China. Meena began telling them the story of Chennai Express. As the story progressed everyone seemed to be more impressed with me. But I was depressed. My mind was stressed. The place where I had arrived was a very dangerous one! Everyone was treating me well. But a goat is also well fed before it is sacrificed! 98... 982136... 98213... I've asked Bobby to geta fancy number many times... but no, he'll just be cheap. All the mobile service providers I tried to contact were all to my brain... This mobile technology definitely connected us with our mothers and sisters but... it had also messed with our heads. At first when there were no mobile phones... then we would remember all telephone numbers. Now that we have a mobile phone we don't remember any numbers! Meena... So when do we get out of here? Meena, don't ignore this please. This drama has gone on for too long, it's quite enough now. - I'm losing patience. - Rahul. Hello sir. Coffee... I was asking... Coffee. - Get him a coffee. - Thank you, sir. Coffee. The food is ready, call everybody. Madhi, come here. Rahul. Rahul. Oh no! Hello. Hey, you are so smart. What are you jabbering on in Tamil? Talk in Hindi. Hey, you are very beautiful. Wow, you learnt Tamil in a day? I love you so much. Hey... I am not this sort of a guy... Please! - Meena. - Rahul. - Madhi. - Puvi. They came. We just followed them. Yes... Let's go. You naughty... What's the hurry? You naughty! Meena I want to get out of here, please do something. Do?? Naughty!! Not naughty. Do in fine? Vanakkam. Coffee? Oh man! Joking! Singh. We need to take a decision in some of these matters. A Punjabi? Here? We need to take a decision in some matter. So we should think and take a decision. You are right... but tell Meennamma that... This Punjabi man is speaking in Tamil. With the boy she should not... give me a minute... This is just great, you're Rahul right? Yes, how did you know? It's the work of policemen, to identify a corpse. A corpse? But I am still.. If it's not been done already, it will be done. Anyways, myself inspector Samsher from Punjab. - Okay, Sir. - Which part? Which part? The whole body my friend. I'm in charge of this area. You have a lot of guts. Fell in love with Meena, knowing that you'll be in the bad books of Tangaballi. Oh no, not at all. People here have misunderstood. Actually these guys want to frame me. You will be framed up on this wall... and a garland will also be placed on your photograph. Garland! No sir. This is against the law. Here you go, you should have thought about all this before falling in love! Tangaballi. I have heard that this time somebody has come with Meena. Yes! What can we do? What is he saying? Tangaballi is asking about you. What is the father saying? The father is saying you are the one because... of who Meena keeps running away from home time and again. Oh not me! My marriage with Meena was already fixed. You are right my dear... Now what is he saying? The father is saying his first choice for Meena is Tangaballi but he is helpless. What can he do if Meena's first choice is you!? No, no... - No...- Yes! I am not here to decide what is right and wrong... it's a prestige issue. Sir, what is he saying now? The father is saying that... to solve this matter now they will all get together and take a decision. Not him, what is the giant saying? He's saying... Now it's not about right or wrong... It's a matter of his prestige. If it's a matter of his prestige... then why is he trying to take away mine? Sir, don't worry. I can handle this. Hi. Are you the one who wants to marry Meena? Yeah. At least hear him out... Who do you think you are? A hero? Yeah. Its okay, he is joking with me... If you are a real man, fight with me! Natural! God's gift! Like you... We fight tonight... If you win, Meena is yours... If I win Meena is mine. What do you say? Yo Bro. He is so tall right! What gibberish was he talking? I can't hear you - please speak up. Don't be scared. He has challenged you. What? You and he will have a fight tonight. Why? - Whoever wins, will get Meena. - Why? My friend you have just accepted the challenge!! But I don't even understand Tamil, I just nod my head. You came here alive. Okay. You will not leave here alive. Never sir. I will cut you into several pieces and parcel it. Tingu sir, that's what I'm saying, peace, love, affection, friendship, Gandhi. Why didn't you tell me what he was saying before? You were tickling me instead! - Let's see. - What? - We will see. - What? We will see. Who is stronger. Who is stronger? What do you mean who is stronger, sir? I am not at all strong. Make them understand. Rahul! Sit. - I know there's a little problem. - A little problem? The fight has been fixed for tonight with that TV tower Tingu. And your father also wants to find out who amongst the two of us is stronger.. - Strong? - Yes, strong... Look Meenamma... if I get angry... Then what will you do Rahul? I will commit suicide. I will consume poison.. Tie a noose around my neck and be run over by the Chennai Express. - No. - The train is calling me. Rahul... Rahul! - Don't panic. - But he's so tall. I will make a plan to run away tonight. He's very hairy and scary. - Till then you remain normal. - No I cannot remain normal. Normal Rahul. - Normal!- Okay. I am normal. You place a time bomb inside a person and ask them to be normal! Okay, I am normal. Hi, I am Normal. You must have heard that name before. - Meenamma! - Yes. So many people. They are preparing for your fight with Tangaballi. I know... but how are we going to get away with so many people around? Don't worry. My escape plan is ready. It's ready? What is it? You just go out and behave normal. - I am normal.- Normal. I will come in a while and signal to you. - Okay. - Then the two of us will run away. Till then you don't make any mistakes. No mistakes. I am normal. No mistakes. Dude, where are you going? You are the one for me. Come and hug me. My body craves for you. Hey I don't know Tamil. Okay, should I sing in Hindi? Just a second... My exotic beauty. I have veiled it. And brought it for you, hidden it from the world. I am stuck between the devil and the deep sea. Will someone tell me what to do? I wonder who has cursed me.

Meena Lochini Azzadddddha Sundaram. Addresses are shorter than this name! I had gone on a holiday, and you took me on a trip! No, I won't nod my head now. Nope! Hey pot King! Why are you sitting on that bike and staring at me? I had full plans of having fun, because of your ashes... I've gotten into so much trouble. Grandpa, I had full plans to immerse your ashes in the waters of Goa but... you changed my entire plan! Why? Y. Y. Mithaiwala? Hey brother... Hold this! You were scaring me by showing me your gun, weren't you? Now I will also show you something. Look! Saw that? Can you do that? No right? That's because your three Michellin tyres come in between. Fatty. Hey Don! You threaten me? Wait. Can you do this? No right? So then? Boss! Mr. Durgeshwara Azzadddddha Sundaram. Tamil is not my mother tongue! Enamma Kanne? You have become a referee? You fixed a match betweenTingu and me. Where's Tingu, where's... bring Tingu. Tingu. Hey you black cloth hanging on a hanger! Will you fight with me? Why? You are so tall and I'm so small. Okay you can fight... but before that show me if you can do this? Tingu look... Can you do this? Catch him. Tangaballi, can you do this? - Hey Sir! - Rahul. What has happened? You and me will have some buttermilk! I will have some buttermilk, come on get up! - Come on get up! - Okay, sir. Oh! You are completely drunk. Careful! Come. Hey don't fall again! Careful! Come here sit. Sit, listen... The station is on the opposite side. Tomorrow morning at 5:30 you need to leave by the first train. Understood? And don't tell anyone that I helped you. - It's a secret. - Yes and let it remain a secret. Else, the entire village will cut me into pieces. Okay? The rest, the Almighty will take care of. Now, go to sleep. Oh my God! Earthquake! Sir! Life of Pi? Hey! Look! How did you come here? From where have you come? - Where is this boat going? - Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka! Why? To get diesel. Have you gone mad? Why are you going to Sri Lanka to get diesel? We're going to Sri Lanka to smuggle diesel. Smuggling! But that is illegal. Everything is fair when one has to survive. If the Sri Lanka Marine police catch us, we will be jailed. If the Indian Marine police catch us, we will be jailed here. If police don't catch us, all is well. Oil is well!! Help me, I've gotten on to the wrong boat. Bring out the gun. Get me the gun. Help me! Gun! Why are you taking out a gun? This is illegal. Don't do that! Very good, sir, well done, sir. Catch them and arrest them. You're the first smuggler who is so happy about being arrested. No, sir. I'm not a smuggler. I am not with them, sir. I am an Indian, sir. Okay. Then show me your passport! Passport! Why, sir? To verify whether you are an Indian or Sri Lankan. These are international waters. International waters! But sir, I am not with them. I talk in Hindi, sir, Hindi!! We can also talk in Hindi. Listen in Hindi! What? We all speak in Hindi! Sir, he's one of our men. - And you are my woman! - What? Shut up. What are you looking at? Arrest him. What does that mean? They say if you suffix word, Ji, (Yes)to any other word... you gain respect. Refu... Ji. I did not gain anything! Here my fate was being written by my grandpa sitting in heavens... whereas Meena's fatewas being written by her father. He decided to get her married off to Tangaballi. Meena was neither happy with it nor was it her choice. Who would have thought that the tip of India... would begin a new chapter in Meena's and my life. Brother, what are you looking at with such fear? - Is this yours? - Yes. I'm sure there is RDX in this. He is... no he was! I mean it was! My grandfather is in it... I mean my grandfather's ashes are in that.. Allow me to show you. Don't move. Okay, Sir... I have been telling you that I am not a smuggler, haven't I? I'm an Indian. My name is Rahul and I'm not a terrorist. You know, sir I came from Mumbai to immerse my grandfather's ashes, that's all. I told the police everything truthfully. My history. The geography of my travel. And my chemistry with the people of Komban. After hearing all this, all the Marine police officer said was... So, the people of Komban know you, right? - Hello sir! - Hello, dummy. So nice to see you... your fellow brothers are dropping me to Mumbai. Give me a hug! You left me right? Because of some smugglers I went away to Sri Lanka. You didn't go away. You came back... to Komban. How can that happen? Look... Look there... - All the best. - Brother, me too. Catch him. What are you doing, man? Please. Sir, please leave me for heaven's sake! Namaste, sir. Namaste. Do you know him? Know him? We know him. - Periya. - Yes. He is our family member, isn't it? Yes, he is one of us. Hey, where had you disappeared? There's such tension since you went missing. Oh family!! So you are an Indian after all. I will release you here and leave. Officer, you cannot leave me here and go. I am Sri lankan. I am Sri... Devi. Ennama kannu... referee? No, sir I meant, Periyathale sir... What... hanger? I meant strong sir. - Michellin Tyre? - No, sir. Chewing gum, huh? Sweet, sir. I mean sweet. Do not step forward. I am warning you. I will cut all bonds of friendship. Hold this. Nobody come forward. If anybody comes forward, I will... cut myself. Okay, cut yourself. Cut yourself. I will cut Meenamma. Stop. I will cut Meenamma. Meenamma, open the door. Don't move any of you! Move! What do I do? Sorry, Tingu sir. Sorry. Catch him. - Come on, get out. - What? First you get drunk and run away all by yourself. Then you get into trouble and use me to... get out of it and then you say get out of the car. Yes that's what I said. Get out please. I won't get out. This car belongs to my father. If you don't get out, I will take you back there. Then from Miss you will become Mrs. Before that, from Rahul you will become Late Rahul. No! I mean, I don't think there's any parking here, let's go. What happened? Has the vehicle broken down? No, who told you that? - What is with the smoke, then? - Smoke? The car is smoking a cigarette. And do you know why I came outside? I thought to myself, that I could wait and relax here and Tangaballi would come by. And, when he does come, the three of us can play together. Can't you see? Your father's car is even worse than your Hindi. You have wrecked the car! Don't call this a car, it'd be a sin to call this a car. This car has saved your life. It's not a car, it's a wreck! My father's favorite car! Go... Catch it, Rahul... Catch it, Rahul. What are you... run. It's Appa's favorite car, Rahul. Catch. Oh no! Here you go... Here, Meenamma baby. Your father's favorite car. Actually the problem wasn't your father's, neither was it his wrecked car... the problem is yours. You see wherever you go, you carry a free trouble pack along with you. Bad luck! Actually you are like a black cat. Worse than a black cat! If you cross the path of the black cat, the black cat will get cursed. Then why are you with me? Why am I with you? Why are you with me? Please, Meenamma. Stop stalking me. From now on. I will go my way, you go your way! Alright. Fine by me. But by the way. You stole the car and drove in the wrong direction. Now we have only one way out. You will have to cross Komban again! Komban! Don't scare me with Komban. If you are not with me, I will manage on my own, like this! Impossible. There's no word called impossible in my dictionary. Really? From where did you buy sucha rubbish dictionary? Don't underestimate the power of a common man. Get lost. I thought I would never meet Meenamma ever again... but fate had decreed something else altogether. Hello, sir. I need to find the road. Where... is... the highway? Okay. Why are you doing that? I want to see the road. Where is the highway? Where is the highway? Okay. Meaning. Meaning! My child, quiet. Don't take so much trouble. I feel bad, then. The two of us have the same problem. At this age there is no need for a new language. Okay. Okay. Excuse me brother. Brother, stop. Brother, hello. What do you want? What is your work here? I'm not Angelina Jolie. I'm a boy, Rahul. I need a lift! You're from Mumbai right? How do you know so much about me? The entire South knows you. One fair boy has eloped with Durgeshwara Azagsundaram's daughter in a car. Oh no, what have you done! Today you are in a car tomorrow you will be the headline of a newspaper. No, listen to me. You don't know, the village people are chasing you with sticks! Once you're caught... they will separate your head from your body and put that as a headline! Let it be... Is it their kingdom? The girl you have eloped with, this is her father's kingdom! Brother, please help me. Go away. Brother help me. I am Angelina Jolie! Brother! I became numb after hearing this... I could see the road ahead... But there was no way out. Except one. Meenamma... Meenamma... Meenamma... Meenamma... What is it? What? You've come back to me after all? Figured it out, didn't you? How does it feel to be alone? Look at your face. It seems like you are getting a fever because you are so frightened. Come on now, I've come to take you. We will go together. Come! Come! Again you've taken the wrong route. This is the safer route, that side you will find Tangaballi. Come on! Listen, I can save you. Listen don't underestimate the power of a common man! Vidamba village. Come on. A wedding ceremony is going on here. We will roam around here and speak to people. We can stay here for a few days... till then father and Tangaballi's tension will get a bit diffused.. Then why are you standing here and talking Ms. Subtitle. Go, go ahead and talk to people. So much style!! Why don't you go and talk? I can talk. This 'Kunjam kunjam'... what? Apadiya sapadiya po. Your grandfather can go take a hike! (In Marathi) You speak in Marathi too? Why? If you can speak in Tamil, why can't I speak in Marathi? Oh mother! Meenamma. For now just go and talk in Tamil. Ready steady go! It seemed very pleasant. As though nothing could go wrong. Once bitten, twice shy... that's why this time I did not nod in agreement to anything! The second time when the villagers looked at me... Now what happened? Hey hey, don't come in front of me... Open the window. Let the fresh air in. Here is the towel and some clothes. Rest well. In the morning, after your bath, we will arrange the prayers. Rest well. Take care of him. Bye. -Thanks. You know, a film should be made on me. I laugh my way into a mess. Whenever people are willing to gladly lift me upon their shoulders... I know I am in a trouble. And you, Meenamma... what are the lies you have spun around this time? I told them we got married and ran away. Have you copyrighted this story of getting married and running away? Then what did you say? The second lie that... I told them was that you are so good that you will never leave me and go. Never! You only said that you wouldn't leave me. Yes. Then I said you got so tired with the journey that you felt faint. That's why... Head!! That's why I'm getting this special treatment. No. The special treatment is because I told them... the reason why we eloped is because my father has a huge problem... with you being poor and me being rich. Yeah. I am very rich. - Of course. - And you are a Sweet Seller. How did you know I was a Sweet Seller? What? You are a Sweet Seller? No. Say it. Yes. I am a Sweet Seller. What is so funny about that? A Sweet Seller is better than being a Don. You understand? Quiet. Okay... Very funny. That means my third lie is actually the truth. Very funny. You are making fun of me now? Earlier, your father made a fool out of me. What a great father daughter combination. I wonder how your mother tolerates the two of you. Does she ever protest or does she also... I don't have a mother. She passed away. I am sorry. I had no idea. I am really very sorry. I know what it feels like to not have a mother. Why? Your mother? They died in a car accident. I was eight years old then. Since then you've been all alone? I am sorry. No. It's alright! Actually I never really missed my parents because... my grandparents took their place. Especially grandpa. He was always happy when I was happy. He couldn't live without me. Rahul this Rahul that... Rahul... He was always there for me! My grandpa. Still Rahul... to go through fifty years of your life without parents... it's not an easy thing! Yes Meenamma, it is hard, but... Fifty years? Yes. Do I look like I'm fifty years old? Why? You're not? Don't tell me you're more than that? I get it. Pathetic, corny joke. Bloody single screen humour! Because you have no class. You are cheap. You are cheap! Meenamma, will you sleep on the floor? This is not for me, it's for you. Why? Won't you be able to control yourself if I sleep with you on the bed? Shut up, okay! I have a problem. Yes exactly, you won't be able to control yourself. - Stop your nonsense. - What does that mean? - It means stop your nonsense. - Do? Oh my naughty! Aunty! Remember! Do... I will sleep on the bed because I am your spouse... your husband. Your mate and don't they say that there is no business like show-her business. Come on Meenamma. Let us sleep-amma. Fine, sleep if you want. Don't tell me I didn't warn you. It's quite late at night. I can give no guarantees. Rahul, think about yourself you will be taken advantage of... tonight because your wife has no control. Shut up.- Baby good night. Don't let the bed bugs bite. Tangaballi... don't come closer. I will kick you. Tangaballi... don't come closer. I will kick you. I will not leave you. I'm sorry but I don't know your language. Do not come closer. Do not come closer... I will kick you. Help me. Meena has gone crazy. Meena has gone mad. Meena has gone mad! Didn't I tell you not to sleep next to me? Childhood problem... I kick in my sleep. Am I your father's scooter that you will kick? You're not the daughter of a don. You're the daughter of a donkey! Sorry. Come and sleep now! Never... I will never sleep with you. You're mad! Get lost. You get lost. Are you dressed up for your morning jog? No. It's the village ritual for newlyweds. Ritual? The husband carries his wife in his arms, up the steps to the temple. They believe it strengthens the marital bond. Okay. Are you strong? What is the need to be strong to watch a ritual? We don't have to watch, we have to do it. We are husband and wife for them. No, I will not be forced into doing anything. No... the situation is like that. What? - Obligation! - What obligation? Do you want to stay here or not? Yes, I want to stay. Then you will have to carry me. You won't drop me right? Meenamma, perhaps you are forgetting. Don't underestimate the power of a... Sweet Seller? Common man. Where is the temple? Where is the temple? Meenamma, where is the temple? We will reach the temple after climbing three hundred steps. Three hundred! I will reach heaven after climbing a hundred. What happened? Where has the power of the common man gone? Meenamma please! I know you will drop me after fifty. Never! Don't underestimate the common of a power man... I mean the power of a common man. Rahul, you carried your wife to the temple... Bravo. Meena, he will take care of you all your life. What is he saying? He's saying that you've proved you will look after me for the rest of our lives. Ya. Raaja, may you live for a hundred years. You both will live together for seven generations. Miss Subtitle. What? They believe that the couples who are able to complete this ritual... God will keep them together for the next seven lives. Why haven't you put kumkum? What is he saying? Without the vermillion the ritual is not complete. What? You should've mentioned it earlier. That means all of this has gone to waste? My hands and my hips are hurting so much! Put this kumkum my son. Oh! She's got it. Thank you, aunty. Thank you very much. No, Rahul. What happened? This ritual won't be complete without the vermillion. These people will take us out from here. Come on and listen. Hurry up. We have to descend 300 steps and this time you will help me. My heart, like a butterfly has taken flight far away. My heart, like a butterfly has taken flight far away. With sweet fragrances it has gone to stay. I have never felt this way a ray of light. kisses the darkness away. My heart, like a butterfly has taken flight far away... Far, far away. Should I say it in words or inscribe it on the sky. Praise be to you. My heart, like a butterfly has taken flight far away. With sweet fragrances it has gone to stay. Your deep brown eyes. Tease me with a glance. Your soothing words can. Also put the birds in a trance. A little incomplete without you, Now I feel complete. Your simplicity has swept me off my feet. My heart, like a butterfly has taken flight far away... Far, far away. Should I say it in words or inscribe it on the sky. Praise be to you. What happened Rahul? What? I am packing. Why? Do you on living here in this Vidamba village? Look Meenamma, this is enough. We will quietly slip away without telling anyone. Otherwise these people will keep making us do weird rituals. - You also get ready. Let's go. - No Rahul. If we run away from here then what will the villagers think? They will think that we've run away. It's no big deal. Come on. You also get ready. It's about the villagers feelings Rahul. They will feel hurt! What about when they find out that we lied about being married? Will they help anyone the next time? Will these people be able to trust anyone again? As it is... Do you want to stay here? Is that it? I've noticed that... ever since you've started playing the role of being my wife... you have been having a lot of fun. Look, just because I put vermillion on your head... doesn't mean you start getting serious about it. - That was a stupid ritual. - Rahul! Only you can think this way! Have you thought about how the villagers would feel? Forget the village, have you thought about your grandmother's feelings? Didn't you say that your grandfather had replaced your parents. And what did you do? You changed the place where he wanted his ashes immersed. - Rameshwaram to Goa! - Yes! I changed the place. Do you know why? Because I... I don't have any feelings. I am bad... actually... I am a very bad man! Only you are very good, these villagers are very good... Grandma is. Grandpa is. And a bad person has no right to stay amongst good people. So I'll just go. You know what, you keep this with you. You are good, he was good. All of you make a company of good people and live together. I am not going to live in this village right. Spare me please! Even though I was mad, I had a sinking feeling... about leaving Meenamma all alone. You've come? Rahul! This... This is too much! One minute, yes. One minute. I'll come there. Hi Tangaballi sir. You and me... No personal enmity here, sir. Why take me, go to Komban village and kill? No point, sir. You've... you've got your lady, sir. Leave me. I ready steady go, sir! Sir! What? From my heart, sir. I am speaking from my heart, sir. Forgive me and forget me. Throw it away, sir. Do whatever you want with your lady, sir. Do... do get married. Do what you want to do, sir. Just let me go. Thank you. Sir, she's your girl. You can sing any song you want to with her. Now Meena is all yours, my friend. Hey you! You're a number stupid, parasite and an opportunist! What? - You are leaving me and running? - Try and understand. - Understand what? - That... - What that? - That only... - What that only? I've played such a game... that I fool the opponent and the game comes into my hands. To save you... I've played a ruse. So this was your strategy? Since when did you become brave enough to defend me? Meena! Washing powder, Meena! What? No matter how wicked I am, I am human after all. I thought to myself that I must help you Meena. Now did you understand what I'm saying... Meena! Pick up the sickle that's... right in front of you and beside Tangaballi. Yes! I will take it. I've understood my lady love. You two think I don't understand... and that you can make a fool out of me. Tangaballi is singing in Hindi? Yes! Balli Balli I am Tangaballi! I know your plan... now you're in trouble. You will not sing to him anymore. Now you will bid farewell to this world, while doing disco! - Okay, that's enough! - Hey Tangu... Hey Tangu... Touch and show Anna, I will cut you. You do not know... whom you are fighting with. We are good for good people and at the same time bad for... bad people... understand. We are in South, but we are in the center of people's hearts. Whoever ridicules our honor and culture, we teach them such a lesson that... they wet their pants. Rahul! Meenamma, ready steady go! Meena... nobody can understand women. At a time like this she's worried about her things! Really, no one can understand women. Come on. Here you go, your ticket to Mumbai. And you? I am going to immerse Grandpa's ashes in Rameshwaram. You know Meenamma, I just realized... the best way to escape your problems is to... is to face them. No matter how wicked I am, I am human after all, Meena. You are right about all... just one thing is wrong. I will also come with you to Rameshwaram. What? Have you gone mad? This is wrong. - I'm doing the right thing. - Right, how? You've got the chance to run away with such difficulty. I could have run away when you were drunk in the village, if I wanted. I didn't run away then. So how will I, now? Its final Rahul, I will also come with you. Meenamma, try to understand... I've taken a decision, let me complete it on my own accord, please. And you might be in danger there. - What if Tangaballi reaches there? - Exactly. I will save you from Tangaballi. That's why I should come with you! Okay? Okay. Okay. Sometimes two roads travel side by side. They slowly converge at the end of the ride. Sometimes when troubles become twice their size... They are halved when shared with someone nice. Our love story is so strange. Sometimes we progress, sometimes we curb. Though I am the north pole and you are the south. Yet our love has brought us together. Though I am the north pole and you are the south. We are equal partners in every situation. Though we fight. Our partnership is alright. With you everything seems alright. We are two different people with different attitudes. We wander the world in style. Sometimes we go apart and come back. We live our lives in the moment our moods change like the seasons. Though I am the north pole and you are the south. The naughty north has given south a wink. Though I am the north pole and you are the south. We will be together, forget about the whole world. Sometimes two roads travel side by side. They slowly converge at the end of the ride. Sometimes when troubles become twice their size... They are halved when shared with someone nice. Our love story is so strange. Sometimes we progress, sometimes we curb. Though I am the north pole and you are the south. Yet our love has brought us together. Though I am the north pole and you are the south. We are equal partners in every situation. Tomorrow morning we can complete the immersion ritual. For tonight we will have to stay in this lodge. It's like this, Meena... we are all so busy running around in this fast paced life. Our lives are no less than a marathon... we're all running to gain something in life. Then someday we leave everything and go away. Just like I will leave you and go tomorrow. All your worries will come to an end. I'm going away forever, Rahul. But where will you go? Puna... My childhood friend lives there. Chitra. I was wondering Meenamma whether you will be safe there or not... I mean what if you father's goons or your cousins reach there? Meenamma you come with me to Mumbai... My house is there... grandma is there... You can stay there peacefully. Thereafter, you can decide for yourself, as to what you want to do. You can start afresh. And what if my father's goons reach there? That's not his kingdom. That is not Komban village, it's Mumbai. Nobody can do such a thing there. And if my father asks you, what I am doing in your house... what will you say then? Then I will tell him... both of us, you know... You and me. It's okay, Rahul. Pune is fine for me. Anyway I have troubled you a lot. It's not your sympathy, but your love that I seek. I ask for your love as I know you love me too. Because of the fear of the world. I promise I will never forfeit you, my dear. I will never let you go. I will never let you go. I will never let you go. If this isn't love. Then what is love? Now that I have won your love. I don't care if I lose the world. I will never let you go. My life has lost its meaning. Since you are not there with me. Love is renowned. Since on this path I have walked down. I will not leave it mid way... From the path of your love, I will not stray. I will never let you go. I will never let you go. Where have we come, Rahul... I don't know... We've come to the right place, Meenamma. They will kill you... - Without thinking twice... - No, Meena. I have come to a decision after a lot of consideration. Rahul, you have gone mad. We had run away from here. But for how long will you run? But for how long will you run? Don't you have any dreams or a life of your own? Hello, sir. You must be wondering how I am back here by myself? - Dad... he means to say... - No, Meenamma. Today your father and me don't need any translation. No subtitles! We're good. Because today I will talk and you will have to listen. Mr. Durgeshwara Azag... Sir! The most import and man of Komban village. Don! Good, sir... It's very good to be important, sir. But it's more important to be good. You must be thinking why I have come here? Who is he? Am I mad? Or am I drunk? No sir, not mad. And no drinks. Not drunk. Sober, sir. I just came to find out why you are being so harsh towards Meena. Why? Don't you love your daughter? No? Because in a wedding yougive your daughter's hand in marriage. But you tried to sacrifice her life. Would a father do such a thing? No father should be like you. No father will be like you. Sir... I am sorry, sir. I am a Sweet Seller. Sweet. But I will say something bitter. You can be the father of this village, the God father of this village... but you cannot be your daughter's father. Never, sir. Your pull and power, full marks for that, very good, sir. But in one subject you have failed, zero... full zero, sir. Emotion, sir. Don't you have any value for your daughter's emotions... her wish, her happiness? No value? No importance? Why sir? Let me tell you, sir. We are in the sixty sixth year of independence. But just like Meena the others girls in this village have... no right to celebrate that independence. No right! And you people too... if you don't care for your daughter's emotions... then this entire village... this unity, Periyathalai! This power is nothing, sir. I say it's nothing! And you Mr. Tangaballi. You're so tall, so big! But with a small heart. Now what do we do? Do we fight? Come on... Come on. Let's fight. Hit me. I will not fight back because I want to do the right thing. No. It is straight and simple. I am a common man. I get angry. And don't underestimate the power of a common man. What is it that you had said? You have come here alive. But you won't leave here alive, wasn't it? I will cut you into pieces and parcel it. Ya? I will fight now. I will fight with you. I will fight with each of your men. Fight everyone! Fight the entire village if I have to. Only for Meena. Because I love her. I do. Rahul! Father, please! Rahul! Rahul! Come on. Fight me. Come on everyone. Enough. No more fights. My body is no doubt very big but your courage is even bigger! Very big. You are like us! Real man! You win! You win! Go, Meena is yours. Meena is yours. Rahul and Meena will get married. Will look after me for the rest of our lives. Those who complete the ritual... are kept together by God, for next seven lives. You love me a lot, don't you? Then we should have just eloped from Rameshwaram. Why did you risk coming to Komban? Meenamma, don't underestimate the power of a... Sweet Seller? Sweet Seller. Now will you nod your head for what I am about to ask you? Do you love me as much as I love you? Meena Lochini... will you marry me? Will you kick me at night, mistaking me for your father's scooter? Sixteen hundred and thirty five languages are spoken in our country. But today I realized, that the most important language is - love! Indeed, love has no language... And I would give the entire credit for the common man... becoming the hero of Komban village to my grandfather. My grandfather! He gave me a wake up call when... I was immersing his ashes in the waters of Rameshwaram. Well all said and done. One wrong train. Chennai Express showed me the right way. And today this Rahul... will surely tell Meenamma that those who love, are the one's who get the girl.
