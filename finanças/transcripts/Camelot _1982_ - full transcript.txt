Why am I on the far side of the channel on this dark and dismal plain, waiting at angry dawn to do battle against the man I love for the woman I love? - The rules of battle are not for Lancelot du Lac, Your Majesty. Let us attack now while they sleep. - We'll attack at dawn, not a moment before. - [Knight] But Your Majesty-- - If the rules of decency are dead at least we will observe the rules of dying. Merlyn. Merlyn. How did I blunder under this agonizing absurdity? Where did I go wrong, how did I stumble? Please tell me, I must know, I haven't much time. A thin inch of sunlight over that hill, and the arrows will begin to fly. Merlyn, if I have to die in battle, please do not let me die bewildered. Merlyn! Merlyn! In whatever cave you hide, wherever in God's kingdom you slumber, I command you to take me back to the beginning! Take me back to the beginning! - [Merlyn] Think, Arthur! Think! ("Guenevere" by Alan Jay Lerner & Frederick Loewe) - I'm thinking, Merlyn. I'm thinking. I'm thinking. Where are you, Merlyn? - I am here, Arthur, under this tree. I know you are up there, come down at once. Wart, do you hear me? Do you hear me, Wart? Come down, I say, you are perfectly safe. There is no one here, no welcoming committee, no carriage, no sign of your bride. (audience laughs) - Merlyn! Merlyn, Merlyn, Merlyn, why are you angry? I know you are because you called me Wart. - Yes, Wart. Your schoolboy nickname. That's what your behavior warrants, perched in a tree, trying to steal a look at your bride, oh. Will you never learn patience? - Patience. I am the king, others must learn patience. (audience laughs) Oh Merlyn, please tell me, how is she? Is she beautiful? - I don't recall. - Oh, rubbish. Are you pretending you don't or you can't remember the future? - When you live backwards in time as I do and have the future to remember as well as the past, occasionally, you do forget a face. (audience laughs) - Oh, Merlyn. Merlyn, I command you as your king to tell me is she or is she not-- - She is beautiful. - Quite, or very? - Very. - Oh, Merlyn. Why haven't you taught me about love and marriage? - Don't, scramble them together, that way they are two different things. Beside, I did give you a lesson once, but your mind was, as usual, elsewhere. You'd better heed me well from now on. I shan't be here long. - Why not? - I have told you, I am doomed to be bewitched by a nymph named Nimue, who will steal my magic powers and lock me in a cave forever. - Nimue, fiddlesticks. Every time you are displeased with me, you threaten me with this creature, Nimue. - [Merlyn] It is not a threat. It will happen someday. It will happen. - Well Merlyn, Merlyn, when you think she's near, why don't you change yourself into a bat? (audience laughs) Oh Merlyn, Merlyn. Do you remember when I was a little boy? You changed me into a hawk? Oh the feeling, sailing through air. Merlyn, do it again, right this minute, for old time's sake, one last soar through the sky. - So you can soar through the sky to her carriage and see her through the window. No. (audience laughs) Merlyn, I must insist that you remember who I am. Please, Merlyn. Change me into a hawk, or I'll have your head (tongue clicks) cut off. - Have my head cut off? (laughs) Oh Wart, it is you who keep forgetting who you are. Think of the joy you brought to Camelot, a radiant young princess never before out of her castle come by treaty to bring peace between peoples, a royal marriage, a new queen. And where is the king? Swinging in the trees, thank heaven! History never knew, thank heaven Malory and Tennyson never found out, thank heaven your people are not aware of your behavior. Now, go back to the castle at once! (mimics whooshing) (audience laughs and applauds) - My people, indeed. As if they give a thought for what the king is doing tonight.

You heard me praying. - Well I couldn't tell, but My Lady, you did pray rather loudly. (audience laughs) - And you know who I am? - You're Guenevere. - Yes, you're afraid I may be your queen. That accounts for your polite, respectable, despicable behavior. - Oh why isn't Merlyn here? He usually senses when I need him, he appears. Why has he failed me now? - Who? - Merlyn, my teacher. He'd know what to do immediately. You see, I'm not accomplished at thinking, and I have Merlyn do it for me. Well he's the wisest man alive. He lives backwards. - I beg your pardon? - He lives backwards. Well he doesn't age, you see. He um, he youthens. (audience laughs) My Lady, let me explain. You see, Merlyn can remember the future and therefore tell you what you will be doing in it. Do you understand? - Well, of course I don't understand. But if you mean he's some sort of fortune teller, I'd give a year in paradise to know mine. I can never return to my own castle, and I absolutely refuse to go on to that one. - You refuse to go on, ever? - Ever. My only choice is to. Don't stare, it's rude. (audience laughs) Who are you? - Uh. Uh. Actually, they call me Wart. - Wart? What a ridiculous name. Are you sure you heard them properly? - Oh yes, My Lady. It was a nickname given to me when I was a little boy. - Well, you're rather sweet in spite of your name, and I didn't think I was going to like anyone in Camelot. Can you imagine riding in a carriage for seven hours on the verge of hysteria, then seeing that horrible castle rising in the distance and running away, then having a strange man come peering at you through the branches looking like a lost owl. You must admit, for my first day away from home, it's quite a plateful. If only I weren't alone, I could. Wart, why don't you. Is it really Wart? - Oh, yes. - Wart, why don't you run away with me? - I, run away with you? - Yes, as my protector. Naturally, I would be brutalized by strangers, I expect that, but it would be dreadful if there were no one to rescue me. Think of it, we could travel the world, France, Scotland, Spain! - Oh, what a dream she spins. And how easy I could be caught up in it. I'm afraid I can't, My Lady. To serve as your protector would answer the prayers of the most fanatic cavalier alive. But alas, I must decline. - You force me to stay? - Oh, not at all. - But you know, you're the only one I know in Camelot. Whom else can I turn to? - Well, if you do persist in escaping, My Lady, I could arrange for somebody brave and trustworthy to accompany you. - Then do so immediately, there's not much time. - Oh, do you look around you, My Lady. Reconsider, Camelot is unique. My Lady, we have here, in Camelot, and enchanted forest where a fairy queen, Morgan La Fey, lives in an invisible castle, and that is most unusual. And we have uh, we have an owl that talks, called Archimedes, he talks, and that is highly original. And we have unicorns with silver feet, the rarest kind.

(audience laughs) (midtempo orchestral music) (Arthur chuckles) - Merlyn! (audience laughs) My Lady. My Lady, when. When I was a young lad, of 18, our good king Pendragon died in London, leaving no one to succeed him. Only a sword stuck through an anvil that stood on a stone, and written on it in letters of gold, it said whosoever pulleth this sword from this stone and anvil is rightwise born king of all England. For many knights tried to dislodge it, but they failed. So a great tournament was proclaimed for New Year's Day so that all the mightiest knights in England could gather together in one spot and have a god at the sword. Well I went to London as a squire to my cousin, Sir Kay. On the morning of the tournament, Kay discovered he left his sword behind, and gave me a shilling to go back and fetch it. On my way through London, I passed this square, and there I saw this sword looming up into the sky. Not thinking too quickly, I thought it was a war memorial. (audience laughs) Well, since the square was deserted, I thought I would borrow it and save myself the journey. I tried to dislodge it, and I failed. I tried again, and I failed again, I tried again, and I failed again, then I closed my eyes, and with all my might, tried for one last time, and ho! The sword moved in my hand and slowly fell out of the stone. I had a great cry, I opened my eyes, the square was filled with people shouting long live the king, long live the king! Long live the. I looked at the sword in my hand, and I saw the blade gleaming with letters of gold. That's how I became king. (audience laughs) I never wanted to be king. I never thought I would be kind. And since I am king, I have been ill at ease in my crown until my eyes beheld you. And then, for the first time, I felt like a king. I was glad to be king, and most astonishing of all, suddenly I wanted to be the wises, most heroic, the most splendid king to ever sit on any throne. If My Lady would come with me, I will arrange for a carriage to take you back to your father. ♪ I hear it never rains till after sundown ♪ ♪ By eight the morning fog must disappear ♪ ♪ In short there's simply not a more congenial spot ♪ ♪ For happily-ever-aftering than here in Camelot ♪ I'm afraid, Your Majesty. - Afraid? - Marriage is rather frightening, isn't it? - Well I must confess, the thought had occurred to me. (audience laughs) Well, of course, now that I've met you, the thought of not marrying sounds infinitely more terrifying. (Guenevere giggles) - But what would've happened if we hadn't? To the treaty? - We would've been broken, and war would've been declared. - War, over me? You're simply marvelous! (audience applauds) - At last, at last he's ambitious, at last. How foolish of me, not to have realized sooner. He didn't need a lecture, he needed a queen. All his life, I have struggled to teach him to think, then over the hill comes his fated maiden, and for her, he wants to be Caesar and Solomon. Man, man goes from love to ambition. Never from ambition to love. Who said that? (audience laughs) Someone in the 19th century, I believe, if my memory serves me correctly. Or was it the 20th? No matter. Now, at last, he will begin putting together the pieces of his destiny. It shan't be long, a night five years from now. Or is it six? No, no, four. Yes, after the battle of Bedegraine, no, no, Bedegraine is much earlier. What is it with me today? My memory is full of clouds. It can't be senility. I've outgrown that.

(audience applauds) - Oh Jenny, you can't deny the facts. Did I not pledge to you five years ago that I would become the wisest, the most heroic, the most splendid king to sit on any throne? - You did. - And in five years, have I become the wisest, the most heroic, the most splendid king to sit on any throne? - You have. - Oh, rubbish, Jenny. I have not become what I pledged to you I would be. I am a failure, and that's that. - Oh Arthur, that's not true. You are the greatest warrior in England. - For what purpose? Might is not always right. - Nonsense, dear, of course it is. To be right and lose couldn't possibly be right. - Might and right, battle, plunder, oh the thought always plagues me. You know Merlyn always frowned on battles yet Merlyn always helped me win them. There must be clue there somewhere, if only I could find it. I'm always walking down a winding, dimly-lit road, and in the distance, I see the outline of a thought, like the shadow on a hill. I fumble, I stumble, at last I get there, and when I do, the hill is gone. Not there at all. Then I hear a voice crying out to me, go back Arthur! It's too dark for you to be out thinking! - Oh, my poor love. Let me see you do it. Walk out loud. Walk out loud. - Oh, Jenny. Proposition. It is far better to be alive than dead. - [Guenevere] Far better. - If that is the case, why do we have battles where people are killed? - [Guenevere] I don't know, do you? - Of course, because someone attacks. - [Guenevere] Of course, that's very clever of you, Arthur. - Thank you, Jenny. Proposition, we have battles because someone attacks. But why, why, why? - Because knights love it. They adore charging around and whacking away. It's splendid fun, you've said so yourself often. - Well it is splendid fun, but it is hardly reason enough. - Oh, well I think it is. And from a woman's point of you, it's wonderfully exciting seeing your knight in armor riding bravely off to battle. Especially when you'll know he'll be home safe in one piece for dinner. - That's it, Jenny! It's the armor. Of course, it's the armor. Look, only knights can afford to bedeck themselves in armor. They declare war whenever it suits them, and they go galloping throughout the countryside, slicing up peasants and foot soldiers because peasants and foot soldiers cannot afford the armor. All that can happen to a knight is an occasional (fist thuds) dent. (audience laughs) Proposition, wrong or right, they have the might. So wrong or right, they're right, and that's wrong. Right? (audience laughs) - Absolutely. Dear Arthur, why don't we have a nice, quiet dinner? And after, if you like, you can stroll again. - Bless you, Jenny. Jenny, Jenny. Supposing we create a new order of chivalry. - I beg your pardon? - Well a new order, where might is only used for right, to improve instead of destroy. Oh yes, Jenny, we could invite all the knights, good or bad, to lay down their arms and come and join us here. We could take one of the large rooms in the castle, put a table in it, and the knights would gather at it. - What would they do? - Oh, uh, talk, plan, discuss, make new laws, plan improvements, I-- - Really, Arthur, do you think your knights would ever want to do such a peaceful thing? - Oh, we'll make it a great honor, Jenny. Very fashionable. They will all want to enroll. Now, now, the knights of my new order would go galloping throughout the world, still dressed in armor, still whacking away, that will give them an outlet for their whacking, only this time, they'll be whacking for good. Defend virgins, rid the wrongs done in the past, help the oppressed, why. (gasps) Why, that's it, Jenny. Not might is right, might for right. - [Guenevere] It's fascinating. - Oh Jenny, it's so civilized. We create a whole new generation of chivalry. Young men bursting with zeal, ideals. - It'll have to be an awfully large table, won't it? But won't there be jealousies. All your knights claiming superiority and wanting to sit at the head. - Oh, of course Jenny, of course. Well then, we'll have to make a sort of, like a circular sort of thing, a round, a round, a round, a round table, Jenny. There is no head. - My father has one that would be perfect. It seats 150. It was given to him once as a present, he never uses it. (audience laughs) - Thank you, Jenny. Oh, Jenny, have I had a thought? Am I at that hill again, or is it all just mirage? I mean, I could be wrong, the whole idea may be absurd. Oh why isn't Merlyn here, now that I need him? He'd tell me what to do. Knights at a table. - [Guenevere] A round table? - A round table. A new order of chivalry. Shining knights gallivanting around the countryside like, like, like angels in armor, swords swinging, apostles battling to stamp out evil, Jenny, it's ridiculous. (audience laughs) Why, it's juvenile. It's infantile, it's folly, it's, it's, it's-- - It's marvelous. - It is marvelous, absolutely marvelous.

And the next time you raise a spear at me, remember, you challenge the right arm of King Arthur. - [Arthur] I am King Arthur! - The king? - Almost the late king. - I struck you? Oh my god! Your Majesty, I am Lancelot of du Lac. I heard of your new order in France and came to join. Oh, I beg Your Majesty to forgive me, not because I deserve it, but by forgiving me, I'll suffer more. - My dear fellow, I don't want you to suffer at all. I want to congratulate you, please rise. You too, squire. - Oh, I can't, Your Majesty, I'm too ashamed to lift my head. - Well then, I command you. (audience laughs) I have never felt a bash in my chest quite like it. It was most spectacular. Where did you learn to do it? - Oh, my skill comes from training, Your Majesty. My strength from purity. (audience laughs) - Oh yes. Well that is a unique recipe. - Well, he is a unique man, Your Majesty. Why, when he was 14, he could defeat any jouster in France. His father, King Ban, made me his squire-- - Did you say Ban? Of Benwick? - Yes, Your Majesty. - What did you say your name was? - Lancelot du Lac, Your Majesty. - Lancelot du Lac. Why, you're Lancelot. I was told you were coming. - [Lancelot] You were told, Your Majesty? - Yes, yes. Merlyn, the court magician, he said to me one day, he said Arthur, keep your eye out for Lancelot du Lac, he will come from Joyous Gard, he will come to the court of Camelot, and he will be, he will be, he will be, oh, what was it now, he would be? - Your ally? If you'll take me. Your friend, who asks not friendship, your defender when you need one whose heart is already filled with you, whose body is your sword to brandish! Did he prophesy that, Your Majesty, for all that, I am. - Well, really. (audience laughs) Well that's far more than I could hope for. That's far more than I should ask. - Then, you'll accept me? - Without hesitation. We will arrange for his knighthood immediately. We will arrange for your knighthood immediately. - No, Your Majesty, not immed. Not immed, not immediately. Not till I have proven myself. For all you know of me now is words. Invest me because of deeds, sire. Give me an order. - Now? - Yes, yes now, this moment. Send me on a mission, let me perform for you. Is there some wrong I can right, some enemy I can battle, some peril I can undertake? - Well actually, there's not much going on today. (audience laughs) Well, well you see, Lancelot. You see, you see, this is the first of May, and the queen and her court have gone a-Maying. I was going to surprise Her Majesty when of course you surprised me. - Well, gone a-Maying, Your Majesty? - Yes, yes, it's a sort of picnic. You know, they eat grapes and chase young girls around trees. - A pic-nic, Your Majesty? (audience laughs) - Yes, yes, it's a custom that we have here. Well this is England, you know, and this is the season for gathering flowers. - Knights gathering flowers, Your Majesty? - Well someone has to do it! (audience laughs and applauds) - But with so much to be done. - Well that's, that's precisely the point, Lancelot. Because there is so much to be done. And it is civilized, and civilization should have some, well, some gentle hobbies. Look, look, look, let's meet the queen. - I should be honored. Oh, Dab, Dab, Dab, I bring the horses to the castle. Feed them and dress them for battle. - Battle? But there is no one to fight today. - One never knows, Your Majesty. Enemies seldom take holidays. (audience laughs) - Yes, I suppose so. Merlyn. - What is it, sire, have I offended you? Did I say something that displeased you? - Oh no, Lancelot. I've just recalled what Merlyn said to me. How wondrous, how strange. Merlyn said that you would be the greatest knight to ever sit at my table, but that was long before I had ever thought of the table, so he knew it would exist, and I thought he meant a dining table, but he meant the round table, so I have stumbled on my future. I mean, I have done the right thing. - But did you ever doubt it, Your Majesty? - Of course, only fools never doubt. (audience laughs) Well, welcome to the table, Lance. Bless you for coming.

You are in the presence of Your Majesty, Guenevere, Queen of England. - Oh really. (chuckles) Your Majesty. We'll have to forgo the bending. These hinges need oiling, been sleeping out for 18 years, no isn't proper, there you are. Do forgive what. (audience laughs) - Who are you, Milord? - Why, name of King Pellinore. May have heard of me, what what, ha-ha. What what (chuckles). - [Man] What what? - What, what, what, what, what? What, what, what, what? (audience laughs) Oh. Oh by the way, where am I now? - Don't you know? - No, no haven't the foggiest. - You are in Camelot. - Camelot. Thank you. Camelot, Camelot. Horrid, Horrid, we've been through here, haven't we, hm? Oh, you wouldn't know, all you can see is hair. (audience laughs) Ah, I remember now, I remember. I remember, I remember, I spent a lovely day here years ago with he most delightful chap named, uh, oh, Court, Lort, Mort, b-b-b, Wart, Wart, what what. Did you ever meet him, Milady? - Constantly. He's my husband, King Arthur of England. - By Jove, is he now? Good for him, well done! (audience laughs) Hoo, yours fondly thought he was grand, simply grand. Oh do say hello to him for me when you see him again, won't you? (chuckles) Oh well, mustn't take up any more of your valuable time. Have to mollock on, now, what. (chuckles) King of England, by George, isn't that well done, Horrid. Thank you so much. - Oh, Milord. I'm sure Arthur would love to see you again. Wouldn't you care to spend the night? - Did? Spend the night? - Yes. - In a house? - In a bed. - A bed. - A feather bed. - Would it have pillows? - Down pillows. - (garbled humming) I'd love that. By George, oh man that is unkindly common of you. I mean, uncommonly kind. (audience laughs) I've just one, and could he possibly sleep somewhere else? - Oh yes, of course, where would you like him to sleep? - I don't know, anywhere. Just anywhere around the castle will do. The moat. (audience laughs) I don't really like him very much. He is a bit of company, but he's, he's a dog. (audience laughs) Very easily do without him. - Then shall sleep in the stable. Sir, would you kindly escort our guest to the castle. - Pleasure, My Lady. - Ma'am, this is too generous of you. It's too generous for words. (chuckles) Oh, what a glorious day. You know, there's even a hint of summer in the air? Or is that you? Oh, come along, Horrid. (audience laughs) - Oh, a delightful surprise. Arthur please forgive us. We have just encountered an absolute cartoon of a man called King Pellinore. - Pellinore? I remember him from my youth, he was a delightful fellow. - I've invited him to stay the night. - Splendid, Jenny, just splendid. Jenny, I want you to meet Lancelot du Lac. - Milord. - Your Majesty. - Jenny, this is the Lancelot that Merlyn spoke of. He's come all the way from France to join our table. - Welcome, Milord. I hope your journey was pleasant. - I'm honored to be among you, Your Majesty. And allow me to pledge to Her Majesty my eternal dedication to this inspired cause. (audience laughs) - Thank you, Milord. How charming of you to say-- - This splendid dream must be made a universal reality. - Oh, absolutely, it really must. Arthur, don't you think-- - I have assured his majesty that he may call upon me at any time to perform any deed no matter the risk. - Thank you, Milord, that's most comforting. Arthur, really-- - I'm always on duty. - Yes, I can see that. (audience gasps) (audience laughs) Arthur, can you stay? - (laughs) I would be delighted, my love. I'd like you to hear the new program we've been discussing. You see, what we thought was, we thought that, um, Lancelot, I think you had better explain it. - To Her Majesty? - Of course. - But would Her Majesty not find the complicated affairs of chivalry rather tedious? - Not at all, Milord. I've never found chivalry tedious, so far. (audience laughs) May I remind you, Milord, the round table happens to be my husband's idea. - Any idea, however exalted, could be improved. - Really? - Yes, I have suggested to His Majesty that we create a standard for chivalry. - Isn't that a marvelous idea, Jenny? - A standard for chivalry? - Yes, a standard for chivalry. Well that way, chivalry will um, will have a standard. - Well yes, Your Majesty. There must be an unattainable goal, that, with work, becomes attainable. Oh not only in arms, but in thought. An indoctrination of noble Christian principle. - And who's abilities would serve as the standard, Milord. - Well certainly not mine, Your Majesty. It would not be fair. (audience laughs) - Not fair, in what way? - Oh I would never ask anyone to live by my standards, Your Majesty. Nor to dedicate yourself to the tortured quest for perfection in body and spirit, oh no. I would not ask that of anyone. - Nor would I. And have you achieved perfection, Milord? - Well physically, yes, Your Majesty, but. (audience laughs) But the refining of the soul is an endless struggle. - Oh, I dare say, I do dare say, do you mean to tell me you've never been defeated in battle or tournament? - No, never, Your Majesty. - I see. And I gather you consider it highly unlikely ever to happen in the future. - Highly, Your Majesty. - Sir Dinadan, Sir Dinadan. Lancelot, tell me, how was the channel? Did you have a rough crossing? - Tell me a little of your struggle for the perfection of the spirit. - Jenny, I think we ought to discuss the training program. - Oh, I'm much more interested in his spirit and noble Christian principles. Tell me, Milord, have you come to grips with humility lately? (audience laughs) - Humility, Your Majesty? - Jenny, I think we ought to discuss the training program elsewhere, not here, not now. Well, you look far too beautiful, my darling, to have anything on your mind except frolic and flowers. Have a nice day. Same to you, Sir Dinadan. Come along Lancelot, come quickly. - Good day, Your Majesty. - Good day to you, Milord. - [Man] By George, that Frenchman is an unpleasant fellow. - [Man] He seems to have the king wrapped around his finger. - [Woman] He's so poisonously good. - [Man] Well, he probably walked across the channel. (crowd laughs) - Sir Dinadan? - Your Majesty. - [Guenevere] When is our next tournament? - It is a week from Saturday, Your Majesty. - And who are our three best jousters? - Sir Lionel, Sir Sagramore, and with all the humility, c'est moi, Your Majesty. (audience laughs) - [Sir Sagramore] My Lady, you shall have my challenge in the morning. - And mine! - And mine! ♪ Tra la, it's May ♪ ♪ The lusty month of May ♪ ♪ The darling month when everyone throws self-control away ♪ ♪ It's fun, it's gay, a libelous display ♪ ♪ Those dreary vows that everyone takes ♪ ♪ Everyone brakes, everyone makes divine mistakes ♪ ♪ The lusty month of May ♪ ♪ Tra la, tra la la la la la ♪ (audience applauds) - Are you truly satisfied with the proclamation, Lance, and is there anything you would like to add? - Oh, not at all, Arthur, it's perfect. Of course, there are one or two changes I would like you to consider. - Of course, naturally. - Sire. - It's for you, Jenny! What changes would you like me to consider, Lance? - Oh, it's not pressing, Arthur, we can do it tomorrow. - No, let's do it now. - I'd rather not, Arthur. If you'll excuse me. - Good evening, Milord. - Good evening, Your Majesty. - Tell me, while I was napping, did I miss any improvements in chivalry? - No, Your Majesty, if you'll excuse me. - Milord. When you're arranging things with God tonight, do be sure and give us nice weather tomorrow. - But no one could refuse your wish. Milady. Good night, Sire, good nights, Milord. - [Arthur] Jenny why, why do you persist in baiting that boy? - Baiting? Not at all. Haven't you heard his latest claim? He says he can perform miracles. - Oh, miracles, what! - Oh, come, come both of you. Surely that was a figure of speech. - Oh no Arthur, he announced to the knights as clear as a bell, he's purity gives him miraculous powers. - Purity, well I can tell you both as clear as a bell, He was referring to his physical prowess, which is vast indeed. - Physical prowess, well, we shall see about his physical prowess in the tournament tomorrow. Do you know Sir Sagramore, Sir Lionel and Sir Dinadan have all three challenged him to a joust? (chuckles) There's three damn strong men. - You mean, he's accepted to fight all three on one and the same day? - Yes, quite. (laughs) I tell you, Arthur, in all my travels I've never met anyone like him. He doesn't drink, he has no lady. Talks to nobody but you and God. He's crammed full of religion. (chuckles) An all around unpleasant fellow. (audience laughs) - Pelly, would you tell the Chamberlain the order of jousts tomorrow will be Dinadan, Sagramore and Lionel. - Ah, ha-ha, the big chap last, eh? (chuckles) Whoa, good idea. Yours hopefully can hardly wait. Good night, ma'am, good night, Arthur. Big chap last, eh? Good idea. (chuckles) (audience laughs) - Oh Jenny, for you. - Oh, its a note of thanks from Sir Lionel. I'm allowing him to carry my kerchief tomorrow. - Oh Jenny, Jenny. Dear Jenny, I would be most grateful if you would withdraw your permission from Sir Lionel. - At this late date, Arthur, that would be rather awkward. - Well then allow, uh, Lancelot to carry your kerchief against Sir Sagramore. - But, I promised it to Sagramore. - Then against Dinadan. - Well he asked so prettily, I couldn't refuse. - Oh Jenny, this is appalling! Jenny there are certain issues here which you have obviously overlooked. You see it will appear to the court that you are rooting for Lance's defeat. - But we don't know he'll be defeated. Besides, he knocked you unconscious and you woke up his bosom friend. Maybe he'll knock them out too, and they'll all take a house by the sea together. (audience laughs) Oh Jenny. Jenny, at the risk of disappointing the knights, I ask you to withdraw your permission from all three. - Arthur, I believe you're jealous of the knights and their attentions to me. Are you, my love? - Jealous, Jenny? Jealous? What absolute rubbish! You know perfectly well that I am delighted the court adores you. I'd be astonished if they didn't. And I trust you as I do God above. Why they've carried your kerchief in tournament a hundred times, and you are dragged me off the subject, and I want you back on it. Now, will you or will you not, withdraw your permission? - Only if you command me as king. - And if I do, will you forgive me? - Never. - If I ask as a husband, will you, as a favor? (chuckles) Jenny. - (giggles) No. Arthur, all the knights are against him, and I quite agree with them. I find him just as overbearing and pretentious as they do. - Jenny that is not the issue. The issue is your kerchief. Can we not stay on the subject? - But there is nothing more to be said. If His Majesty wishes me to withdraw permission, let him command me and yours humbly will graciously obey. What, what, what, what, what, what, what. - What, what, what, what, what, what, what.

(audience laughs) Ooh, he was an enormous, big chap. I mean, however the boy did it, it must take an awful lot of whatever it is he uses. I say, do you think he could help cure my rheumatism or does he only go in for bigger things? You know sometimes from sleeping out all those years I get a pain that starts about here-- - I don't know, Pelly, I don't know! The boy is in the hall, go down and ask him! The walk will do you good, and the quiet will do me good. - I say Arthur, that's a bit snappy. (audience laughs) All right, I will. I'll go down and see the fellows. - Wait, Pelly. It was a bit snappy. I do apologize. - Of course. (chuckles) Unimportant. - Pelly, have you never been in love? - No, Lord old chap, no, no. Never had the time. Always been too busy chasing the beast. Now, I'm not young enough or old enough. - I'm too young and too old. I'm too old not to be uncertain of fears that might be phantom, and too young not to be tormented by them. - Well I, I don't know what you're talking about Arthur. Ah, well ma'am. Hoo-hoo, that was quite a day wasn't it? - Yes it was, Pelly. - (chuckles) I must say, you were very generous with the boy, ma'am. When he stood there looking at you and you stood there looking at him, I must say it was very touching. Didn't you think so, Arthur? - Pelly. Pelly, summon the Chamberlain. Alert the court there are to be festivities tonight. Ask him come to my study and bring the names of those awaiting knighthood. - Right, festivities, eh? I'd better get down to the blacksmith's and get into my formal togs. (laughs) - Jenny, you look rather tired. - Oh yes I am, rather. - I'm sorry to have to put you through a formal affair this evening, but I thought Lance should be invested immediately. - Oh yes, of course. I shall be all right - Jenny. Jenny, why don't you take Lady Anne and go to the lodge for a few days? I'll join you in the weekend. You know how she always amuses you with her gossip of the court, and I think it might do you good to get away from chivalry and round tables for a while. Don't you think?

I didn't mean to disturb you, but I was told that Arthur wanted to see me. - I believe he does. And you're not disturbing me, Lancelot. You are to be knighted. - When, Milady? - This evening. - I wish he would not. - Why? - I'm not worthy of it, Milady. I don't deserve it. - Not deserve it? Lancelot, what greater wonder could you ever perform? No, I'm sure Arthur will insist on it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must change for dinner. But do wait here, Arthur will be-- - Jenny, don't go. Jenny, I love you. God forgive me, but I do. - God forgive us both, Lance. - I, I knew it since the first afternoon. Not when we met, but when I walked away. - When I-- - Lance! Lance! Lance! Lance, oh, Lance. I have been searching for you everywhere. What a stunning achievement, my boy! And the court, you could almost hear their hearts burst open to you. Surely I can arrange your knighthood now. Sainthood is not in my power. - I shall be honored, Arthur. - But before we throw ourselves into pomp and ritual, I thought that we three might have a quiet drink together. If you'll make an exception, Lance. - I'll do it. - Do you have any idea the impact this miracle will have on the country? When this is known, they'll come flocking to the Round Table from one end of England to the other. From Scotland and Wales and all those quests we've planned for the knights, Lance, may now not be necessary. For when it is known what has happened here in Camelot it is possible that they will lay down their arms and come of their own free will. It is possible that they will never take up arms again. And all orders will disappear and there will be a real, P, P, peace. And all the things I dreamed. I dreamed. I dreamed. (uptempo orchestral music) Excalibur. - The invested knights of The Round Table of Brackley, Colgrevance. Of Winchester, Bliant. Of Wales, Guilliam. Of Cornwall, Castor. Of Joyous Gard, Lancelot du Lac. - Proposition. If I could choose, from every woman who breathes on this earth, the face I would most love, the smile, the laugh, the touch, the voice, the heart, the very soul itself, every feature and detail to the last strand of the hair. It would all be Jenny. Proposition, if I could choose from every man who breathes on this earth a man for my friend, a man for my brother and a man for my son, they would all be Lance. I love them. Yes, I love them, and they answer me with pain and torment. Be it sin or not sin, they have betrayed me in their hearts, and that's far sin enough. I see it in their eyes and hear it when they speak, and they must pay for it and be punished. I shan't be wounded and not return it in kind. I'm through with feeble hoping. I demand a man's vengeance! Proposition, I am a king, not a man. And a very civilized king could it possibly be civilized to love myself above all? Could it possibly be civilized to destroy the thing I love? What of their pain and their torment? Did they ask for this calamity? And can passion be selected? Is there any doubt of their devotion to me and to my table? By God, Excalibur, I shall be a king. This is the time of King Arthur, and we reach for the stars. This is the time of King Arthur, when violence is not strength and compassion is not weakness. We are civilized. Resolved! We shall go through this together. They, you and I! And may God have mercy on us all.

How much do you think Arthur knows? - What is there to know? Desire without hope, love without loving. - Why does he never leave the castle without one of us with him? There are rumors in every corner of every hall. Surely he must have heard them. Jenny, what if they erupted into accusation? - There is a court of law now Lance, there can be no accusation without evidence, and there is no evidence and never will be. It is time to go, Lady Anne? - [Anne] Yes, Milady. - I have a thrilling engagement this afternoon, Lancelot. I'm giving the prizes at the cattle show. I can't wait to see who wins. - Oh, I have the list of winners for you, Milady. - Oh, the Aberdeen Angus for a change. I'm so pleased for him. He's been working so hard and losing for years to the short horns. Thank you for waiting with me, Lancelot. - Thank you for allowing me, Milady. - Ah, Camelot. Where the king gives freedom and the queen takes liberties. You poor things. Perhaps we can arrange a little rendezvous for you. - Ah Pelly, have you seen Lance? He just left, Your Majesty. He was here with the Queen. - With the qu-- You aren't a member of this court. How dare you enter these grounds unannounced. - But I was announced, Milord. Did the Chamberlain not say that there was a young man from Scotland who wished to bring you greetings? - And were you not informed all visitors are to return tomorrow afternoon? - I shall be busy tomorrow afternoon! - By Jove, what impertinence! You must be taught a lesson. - Keep away, don't touch me, I'm unarmed! - Oh Pelly, call the guard! Have this impertinent young idiot thrown out. - That's not a very kind way to treat the son of Queen Morgause. Yes, Your Majesty. I am Mordred. - Mordred, wait-- - Your Majesty. - Leave us, Pelly. Well I'll be waiting nearby, if you need me, Arthur. - I bring you greetings, Your Majesty, from Queen Morgause and King Lot. - Mordred, I had lost track of the years. I had no idea you had grown to manhood. Please rise. I trust your mother is well. - The queen is splendid, as ravishing as ever. Which is not surprising. Vigilant selfishness is wonderful for the skin. (Arthur chuckles) I've been wandering about the castle. It's quite grand, really. I love the way you've mixed English with French. Very tasteful. - [Arthur] And what brings you to Camelot, Mordred? - A desire of blood, Your Majesty. I have followed my brothers here. Half brothers. - (laughs) Oh, they'll be so miserable to see me again. Do you know what they did to me once? Mother had a youth potion that took off ten years. When I was nine they gave it to me to make me minus one. (Arthur and audience laugh) - To visit your brothers whom you detest seems a rather odd reason for so long a journey. - And there's you, Your Majesty. As I was saying, I kept asking mother why King Lot despised me so. And then one day, not long ago, she told me the marvelous news. He's not my father. How once, when she was visiting England, she met an attractive lad named Arthur, invited him to her room and bewitched him for the night. Is that the way the story goes, Your Majesty? - Yes. That's the way the story goes. - You can imagine her surprise when later he became the King of all England. - Ah-ha! Ah-ha. Ah, ha. Oh yes, I can imagine her surprise. And now that you're here, what are your plans? - That's for you to decide, Your Majesty. - Of course it is. Here is what I suggest. Here is what I offer. Here is what I. (Mordred chuckles) You will remain here in Camelot and become a Knight of The Round Table. You have youth, brains and a proper heritage. Much can be done, if you apply yourself. - How generous of you, Your Majesty! I can think of nothing that would please me more than to gain your confidence. - Oh, I'm certain of that. I shall be watching you carefully Mordred, very carefully indeed, to see that you deserve it. Tonight you will dine with the queen and me, we will try to get to know you better. Tomorrow your training will began. But I must warn you, Mordred, favoritism will not be shown. The right to knighthood must be earned by virtue and proper deeds. - I shall try, Your Majesty. - No doubt you will. And Mordred. You will not turn your back on me, and you will leave, when I tell you. I'll have you know that I am a civilized man with the occasional lapses. The adage blood is thicker than water was invented by undeserving relatives. - Virtue and proper deeds, Your Majesty? Like what? Courage, Milord? Purity and humility, my liege?

Tonight is the first night in a month he hasn't been here for dinner, and not having him here makes it seem like a party. - Arthur, I implore you, get rid of him and quickly. Arthur, he's setting knight against knight. He's bent on the destruction of the table, and I'm beginning to believe he may achieve it. - I know Lance. - Arthur, you've got to face it, you've sired a snake. (audience laughs) - He'll stop at nothing to destroy you to make his inheritance come faster. No matter how or through whom. - Then we must make certain that our passions do not destroy our dreams. We must make certain that he is not given the opportunity. - Well, let him cross my path and so help me, I'll run him through. - You will not, Lance, you won't harm him I forbid it. - But he's your mortal enemy. - He's still my son! Lance, despite all logic I can't stop hoping that there's still some good in him that I can reach. Besides, we got civil law here now. We can't take that law back into our own hands. If he violates the law, the law will deal with him. I must have your word on that. - If that is what you wish Arthur. You have my word. Goodnight ma'am. Goodnight Sir Pelly. - Goodnight Lancelot. Pelly, tomorrow let's go hunting. I could do with some fresh air. - (chuckles) Now that is a better idea than your court of law. Goodnight ma'am. Goodnight Arthur. (chuckles) - Arthur, would you like to be left alone? You spend so much time alone these days. - No Jenny, I would like you to stay. Please stay, stay. - Arthur, I hope you suffer no guilt over Mordred. I feel nothing for him, and neither should you. After all you're not the first king to have one of those things running around. (audience laughs) - I do feel nothing for him. There is no mistaking the fact that he is a venomous specimen. - Amen. Well there's one thing I can say for him, he's bound to marry well. Everyone is above him. (audience laughs) - Ah Jenny, even if he were banished, He would still remain a constant menace to the throne and a threat to us. Oh Jenny. - Oh, that dreadful boy. One more added burden we could do without. - That's one burden we cannot avoid. - Royalty never can. Why is that Arthur? Other people do. They have ways and means of finding respite. What do they do?

Merlyn! - Arthur, where are you? (chuckles) Well come a long Arthur. There's no partridges here. No self-respecting bird would be caught dead in a place like this. - Wait Pelly, wait. Hello! Hello! - [Merlyn] Hello Wart. - Pelly. Echoes never forget Pelly. This is where I grew up. This is Merlyn's school house. This? School house? Most depressing halls of academia yours truly has ever seen. (chuckles) What could you possibly learn in a place like this? - Well, if I told you how Merlyn taught me, you would not believe it. - [Pellinore] Of course, I believe it. - By turning me into animals and birds? - I don't believe it. - It's true. Here I was a, I was a fish and a hawk and a unicorn. Oh Pelly, the fun. I was so young then. It was all filled with pink, green, blue, yellow, gold and wrapped in sunlight. - Well Arthur, you stay here and have your little class reunion. I'll just go and shoot a bird. Ooh, I only hope it won't be you. - Merlyn, Merlyn. Merlyn! Show me how to think! Merlyn! (dream-like harp music) Merlyn. Merlyn. Merlyn. Merlyn, how big a fish am I? I've just seen a big fish eat a little fish. Am I the dinner or the diner? - [Merlyn] What have you seen Arthur? Think! What have you learned? - Oh, nothing very much. Except that, big fish eat little fish like they do everywhere else. And that's not right is it Merlyn? Merlyn. Merlyn I. I, I don't like this pond. Hook me out. Change me into a hawk! - [Merlyn] Look down Arthur, what do you see? - Trees and fields. - [Merlyn] Can you see where Camelot ends and the next province begins? - Of course not Merlyn, there are no boundaries up here. Their are no boundaries anywhere. - If you can see them on the ground and you can't see them in the air, then what do you know as a hawk that you didn't know as Wart? Think Arthur. - I'm not thinking Merlyn. I'm gliding. The wind is taking me higher and higher and higher. Oh God, it's so beautiful up here. (dramatic orchestral music) Merlyn. - Good afternoon, Your Majesty. - Merlyn. Mordred. What are you doing in the woods? - Following in your footsteps, Your Majesty. Isn't this the legendary forest you told me about so often? - Yes, yes it is. - Have you come to gather a few stray nuggets of wisdom you may have left behind? - Wisdom, joy, call it what you will. Merlyn? Mordred, come. Come sit beside me. Mordred, I don't clam to have remembered everything that Merlyn taught me but this I do remember, happiness he said, is a venture. You can't be happy and wicked. Triumphant perhaps, but not happy. Now if I could teach this to you and make you believe it, then at last, you will be my son. - Are you happy, Your Majesty? - Yes. - Is the queen? - Yes. - And Sir Lancelot? - What are you implying? - Nothing, Your Majesty. It is simply that I did not realize that deception and hypocrisy were candidates for the badge of happiness. You wish me to be your son no more than I. Then prove to me, I am wrong. Give your son the lesson of his life and show me how virtue can triumph without your presence. Return to the castle! Inform the court that His Majesty will be hunting throughout the night and will not return until, mid-morning. - Yes, Your Majesty. I shall deliver your message at once. - Lance, Jenny. Be wise. Be wise. (midtempo orchestral music) Oh God! God, send an angel to the castle and tell them to be wise! Be wise! ("If Ever I Would Leave You" by Lerner and Loewe) - Jenny? - Lance. - I saw your lights in the window. I tried to stay away. - Did anyone see you? - No. No, no one. The castle is dark. I was careful. Jenny, don't be afraid. - But I am afraid. We're alone, I swear. No one saw me enter. Jenny, Arthur's hunting through the night and-- - We're not alone, are we, Lance? - We are, we are. - We're not. Here you are at last, with your arms around me, and the first thing we think of is him. But you love me, Jenny. - Oh, I do. I always will. Night after night I've thought of you here and wished for it with all my being. But now suddenly, we are less alone than ever. - But why? - Can't you see the shadow that's come between us?

It's because we're here, here in Camelot that everything is so wretched. - No, Lance. - Jenny, Jenny. Come away with me to Joyous Gard. Let us have it open and above board at last. - I've told you a thousand times I will never leave Arthur, ever. Now, let us say no more about it. - But this agonizing torment day after day, year after year. Would God I had your talent for acceptance, your invincible English calm - Oh, the insensitivity of sensitive men. Always they suffering so much, they can suffer nothing for others. You think you're the only one in torment. I'm just as tortured, just as anguished as you. But what would you have us do to this man we both love? Run away, leave him? Make him publicly miserable? Force him to declare war on you, where either one of you, if not both, would be killed, as well as hundreds of others? What sort of heartbreaking solution is that? - Forgive me, Jenny. Forgive me.

Why did you teach me how to think? Was it to create a mirage called hope and ideals? Barbarism is a natural state of man. What good is reason if it doesn't touch the heart? - Jenny, he's here. - Was either of you hurt in the escape? - Untouched, Arthur. - Arthur, we want to return with you to England. No matter what the cost, we've got to make things right. - [Lancelot] This war will do horrible harm to the Table, Arthur, we must stop it now before it grows. - [Guenevere] Arthur, let us pay for what we have done. - At the stake? No, I won't take you back. I shan't let you return, for what end? Justice? They have forgotten about justice. They want revenge! (Arthur sobs) Revenge! Revenge, the most worthless of causes. It's too late, Lance, the table is dead. It exists no more. - [Guenevere] What? - Over half the knights were killed in the yard. Some have escaped with Mordred to Orkney, I suppose to organize an army against me, and the rest are waiting in their tents, itching for dawn, cheerful to be at war again. It's those old uncivilized days returned once more. Those dreadful days we thought to put to sleep forever. - It's your wish, Arthur, that this dread battle go on? - No, it's not my wish, Lance! It is not my wish! Well I, I. I can think no longer what to do but to ride the tide of events. Oh God. God. All we've been through, for nothing but an idea. Something you can't touch or taste, smell or feel, Something without substance, life, reality or memory. (trumpet music) The charade begins soon. You must go back to Joyous Gard. - Jenny is not at Joyous Gard, Arthur. She. She stays with the Holy Sisters. Is there nothing to be done? - There's nothing to be done, but play out the game and leave the decisions to God. Go now. Go, go please. Please go now, go. Lance! Lance. (somber orchestral music) You. You must go to Jenny. - [Guenevere] I know. So often in the past, Arthur, I would look into your eyes, and there I would find forgiveness. Perhaps one day in the future it'll be there again. But I won't be with you. I won't know it. - Oh Jenny. Jenny. Jenny. Goodbye, my love. - Oh, Arthur. I see what I wanted to see. - My dearest love. Who's there? Who's there? Come out, come out I said, come out. - Forgive me Your Majesty I was searching for the Sergeant of Arms and got lost. I didn't wish to disturb you. - Who are you? You ought to be in bed. Are you a page? - I stowed away on one of the boats, Your Majesty. I came to fight for The Round Table. I'm very good with a bow. - And do you intend to kill people with this bow of yours? - Oh yes, Milord. A great many I hope. - And supposing they kill you? - Then I shall be dead M'lord. But I don't intend to be dead. I intend to be a knight. - A knight? - Yes M'lord. Of The Round Table. - Well tell me, when did you decide, upon this nonexistent career of yours? Was your vintage protected by knights when you're small boy? Your father, did he serve a knight? Your mother was she saved by a knight? - Oh no M'lord, I had never seen a knight until I stowed away. I only know of them, the stories people tell. - And from the stories people tell, you wish to become a knight? Tell me what you think you know of the Knights and The Round Table. - I know everything my Milord. Might for right, right for right. Justice for all. A Round Table were all knights would sit. Everything. - Come here, come. Come, come, come, come. Come hear my boy. - What is your name? - It is Tom, Milord. - And where is your home, Tom? - In Warwick, Milord. Now listen to me, Tom of Warwick. You will not fight in the battle tonight. Do you understand? - Yes, Milord. You will run behind the lines, hide in a tent until the battle is over. Return to England alive. To grow up and grow old. - [Tom] Yes, Milord. - And for as long as you live you will remember what I, the king, tell you, and you will do as I command. - [Tom] Yes, Milord. - Each evening from December to December.
