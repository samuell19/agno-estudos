'Your voice to billions of people may calmly, joyable and peacefully' 'But, in my personal life your voice very caring and always with your bless' 'Thanks to Tamilnadu Police Department' 'Thanks to press, media internet and social media friends' 'Anacondapuram' Go inside! It might descend any minute! Go! The 'Soothsayer' is here. Quick, get inside. You! Mr. Dry chilli! You've been peeing for long now! If it comes here then you'll be long gone! Get inside! Get inside! No one must step outside! After dark, especially men, don't step out! Get back into your houses! What's that sound? Sounds like a cat playing a flute! Where is it coming from? Who the heck is he, playing it at this odd hour? Who are you? Even in this brightness, you appear so pitch dark! Don't sit here. Just leave. Go! I'm talking to you. God! Fine, keep playing. If it comes down... it'll snatch away your flute and unleash hell upon you! Who are you talking about? Here it comes! God! Run, Mr. Baldie! If it catches you, it'll squeeze the life out of you! Run! Don't sit there! Just run! God! Eww! Pathetic! (Chanting mantras) Looks like it'll strip me off my clothes! You better return back! Run! Bangaru, Kangaroo, Pandiamma, Pachiamma... come out all of you! - What happen? - Just shut up and come. I don't know him but looks like the villain from those old age Amman movies! Dear 'Akhanda' Balakrishna, the saviour who has come to save our Anacondapuram! Finally, you put an end to the sound that was troubling us all these days. Behind this hill, there is a huge palace. There is a spirit inside that palace and many are trying to wake it up. But what they don't know is that... without going into that palace, that spirit cannot be awakened. By any chance, if someone wakes up that spirit... ...then it'll destroy all of you! Swami, you must save us! I cannot save you. I've sketched a person in this cloth. Only he can save you all. Go and find him at any cost! I wonder who is this great man? Greetings, in Current Affairs show today, we have the legendary writer, Mr. Sudhakar with us. Sir, what are your thoughts on the modern day cinema? What do I tell you? Back then when the heroine is introduced... the camera angle was from the stove tip but today it's from the heroine's hip! I guess that's why look miffed! Why don't you write a good story? Good story writers are not welcome today. Only erotic story writers are having a ball. Good writers, like me, are struggling and dying of poverty. Not even a single interesting photos in here! Who are you? I am Pooja. I am the new maid. Have it and tell me how you like it? Here, keep this. Here, take it all! We could see an unbelievable happiness on the face of that bear! When she noticed those cheap coins on the floor, she realized that... he is a cheapskate! Whether to accept those cheap coins and that cheapskate? She was battling with that question in her mind. Sir, did the water supply come today? Sir, don't you have any sense? I'm writing my script! To hell with your water supply! Go and find it out yourself! Yeah right! As if you're writing a story like Bahubali! It's after all a B Grade movie! So, stop reacting so much! A script like Bahubali can be easily written by a group of writers. But a script like this cannot come from discussions. It comes from our feelings that resonate... that we've seen and experienced from childhood. You will never know all that, sir. Well, I don't know if you really have those feelings... but ever since I met you... - I have lot of regretful feelings, sir! - Why? Why? Remember what you told me in our first meet? What did I tell you? 'I am director A. Bharathi' I must have got alerted when you said "A". Bharathi. I should've know you're an 'A' rated film maker. How did I miss it? Eww! On top, I have to wake up to all these posters ever morning! As an aspiring director... Bharathi Raja, Balachander, Mani Rathnam... or Christopher Nolan; their posters must be on the wall. But who are they, sir? Where did you even find these rubbish? Rubbish? Excuse me, sir! Those are my references. Years of hard work! You don't have to beat around the bush hereafter. Say it on my face! If this is not saying it on your face... then I must tell like this! This expression right here, sir! You threw it anger. That'd be a normal film. If the heroine does the same, then that's the film we are making. Simple! God, wonder what more is in store for me here! Why is the manager calling me so early? Hello. Mr. Director, I arrived here half an hour ago. Get ready and come down before auspicious hour is over. We are ready. Give us two minutes. Must convince the producer, get an advance and first, I must replace the cameraman. Yeah you can do that but why are you not punctual, sir? Now come, sir! You dwarf! One slap and... Does this place look like a toilet? Your granny can't teach you manners... but she'll pester us every month for rent! What did you drink? Your pee is so hot! Yeah right! You guys haven't paid a penny as rent, in last three months! And look at you running your mouths! Here, clean the floor where my grandson peed! - Myself? - Go ahead. Do it. Look how she's getting back at us! Sir, do a neat job. Where is the tea? Quick! You call this a tea and run this tea shop? - Damn, I'm so proud. - Shut up and drink it! - Ready. - Welcome, guys. - Would you like some tea? - We don't have that habit. Good habit. So be it. Please pay for the tea I ordered. We don't drink tea because we are broke. Drats! Both of you follow my scooter. Please, we'll follow you on your scooter. So, no vehicle? Oh Lord Shiva! Let's go. Sir, please make some seat for me. Sir... What's the matter? - Here to narrate the story to Baby. - Please wait. He wants you to narrate a story to a baby? Sir, this story cannot be narrated to baby. I'm so experienced that I can make out the story from it's title. So tell me the title, then I'll decide if you can tell it to Baby or not. Sir, go ahead. 'The Cockroach and cougar Kanaga' You guys are so naive. Such silly titles in this modern era! People are making films with 'Cheetah', 'Lion' in their title. Listen. Baby must be awestruck after hearing the story. Why do you have weapons when there's baby in the house? Careful, you might hurt the baby. Quiet now! Both their faces tell me they are crooks! - He's Baby. - I must get the interest! Hope they know about me! Tell them that I'll finish off them and their family! This boy is the director. A. Bharathi. He has excellent stories with him. When he narrates, even the stone hearted will shed a tear in the end. In short, he will touch you with his sto... What? - That's too much of a build up. - Wait. A build up is necessary. You can call him the next big director like 'Bala'. He will mesmerize you with his story. Sir, his whole family is sitting here. Do we really have to tell the story? Their faces tell me that they will like this story. Confirm it with him once more. Sir, will they all be there when I narrate the story? Of course. After all, they must get hold of ladies emotions. I hope the story has ladies emotions. Of course. There's ample amount of it. Isn't it, sir? Don't waste time and let your life slip away. Narrate the story. Jai Rajamouli. We open the frame showing.... two wet clothes drying outside a house. A boy and a girl are inside the house, and that too naked. At that moment, the door bangs and locks itself. Now guess what happened inside the house. Sister, you tell me. Granny, any idea? - Okay, at least you tell me. - Director... my future lies in what you're going to reveal next. Quiet now. The wet clothes dry up outside. And both of them inside the house turn wet. Oh Lord Shiva! Game over! Where are you going? Let me shut the door. Told you! She's hooked on to the story. Go ahead and shut the door. She's not hooked on to the story but I'm hooked on to my bad time! It was shaking for a long time. In the name of narrating story, they broke my tooth! Demons! When you know they are beating, why would you show your face first? I blocked it perfectly. - Sir! How about me? - Better than last time! - Thanks, sir. - You've made a progress. Who are you guys? So this is your routine? God bless you! Just get lost! To hell with his Cockroach and caterpillar! Stay and I'll give you a share from the movie's earnings. Sir, get me salary first. Then we can discuss shares. You're expecting salary? What happened? I just saw two wet clothes drying up, over there. Enough! - Oh Lord Shiva! - See the impact of that scene? What happened, Sowmya? Again that nightmare? Who died today? I did. Awesome! I must first move to another room. Why do you keep checking out this photo every time you have that nightmare? What's special about this photo? It's not just a photo. My ancestors used to gather up and pray to it. I'm linked to it in some way. Greetings, officer. This house. You leave. I'll take care of it. Sir, the whole locality looks eerie and quiet. What's with all the smoke? Who are they and what are they up to? Each and every one of their faces look like criminals with murder charges! Sir, there's a girl too! Wake him up! Who are you? Get up! I said, get up! Now who is this fellow? Who kept the globe on this shelf here? - It's not a globe but my head! - Who are you? I am the Scorpion priest - Govindalu! How dare you enter this place without my permission? - What does he mean? - Stop blabbing! Do you know who is he? Are you working under him all these days without knowing that? Are you an exorcist? - Are you his driver? - Damn it! Sir, their looks are very fishy. I've an important work at Commissioner's office. - Deal them and come. I'm leaving. - Sir... I also have an important work at police station. I'll also come. Bring that girl to the police station. We must inquire her! Don't bring these guys! Please madam, come to the police station. - She won't come if you ask like that. - Then how must I ask? Ask her out on a date to ECR and she'll come! Really? Shut up Mr. Punctured Football head! Hold this! Don't handle it like you carelessly handle your urine sample! You must handle it safely, okay? I am going to kill them today. You scumbag. Where is that A. Bharathi? Don't move sir. You ill fated moron. What did you tell my husband last night? He asked me about my story, so I gave him a gist of it. You gave a gist? That man did not let me sleep the whole night. It's a good thing, right? - I will... - Calm down. - He was repeating the story whole night! - Damn. I did not sleep for a second. He tortured me the entire night. Hi, we were discussing about the story. I warn you, don't listen to his stories. I was hoping that you will get awards someday. But you are getting hit by women. - It's a rehearsal. - Is it? I have found a producer for your movie. He is trying to make a movie for a longtime. But there is a catch to it. He wants to be the male lead. He can act even as female lead. We will manage. - There is another condition. - What? I cannot take you to him. I owe him debt money and I am absconding from him. If you meet him alone, you can narrate your story. Just tell the person, I will flatter him. He will visit an important place, once in every week. Lure him with your story. - This is the address. - Okay. All hail Lord Shiva! See you. Drive careful. (KAMADEVA SPECIALTY HOSPITAL DOCTOR KUNJANGO) Doctor Kunjango? - Ma'am, I want to see the doctor. - Please wait. It's so funny, the sort of problems these men face. Yes, I should also ask my boyfriend to visit our doctor. Sir. I think that owl- eyed fellow is getting us into a trap. Is this a place to narrate a story? This is the right place to narrate our story. What happened? Looks like my boyfriend is here. Let's give it a try. He is a clever guy. Be quiet. I wonder why he is here. I will hide myself, you talk with him. Okay. Hello! What do you two want? We are here to meet someone. Everyone is here for same reason. Fill this form first. Fill up the form, I'll see if he is inside. - Form? What the hell? - Pushpalal Sait... 'Kamadevan Special Hospital No further tension' Will meet him and tell the full story. Will get deal from him Super! Your hands are trembling. Is it that serious? Yes, it is my longtime dream. I should somehow make it work. I have been coming here for the last ten years. It has not worked for me yet. You think you make it work on the first day? Stop blabbering something. Let my hands go. Here it is. You have written 'no' in sex column. No, I have not experienced it yet. You idiot! You have to mention male or female here. Get lost!. Sir... Every one here looks sick and dull. Where can we find him in this crowd? I don't know. Dad! Tell me. Really? What is it? - Oh yes. - Pushpalal Sait. Yes. God! Sir...oh sir. - You look perfect. - Take your hands of me. Sir... You don't know him? - He is our regular customer. - You shut up. The same chubby face. You look exactly like I imagined. Manager Muthukumar sent us here to narrate a story to you. He is a fraud. He cheated me without paying the loan interest. You two really believed him? I have a superb story for you. My real story is already stinking. Don't play around. - Pushpalal. - They are calling me. Bye. - Yes coming. - Go narrate your story, go. Pushpa! 'Doctor Kunjango' Listen to the one-line story. You will be impressed. Who are you two? Tell me. I am A.Bharathi. I am a film director. Like I care about it! - Who is the patient here? - Him. Why are you pointing at each other? Enough! Who is the patient among you? Listen. If you do exactly as I say, I will agree to make your movie. - He is the patient. - Yes, I am the patient. What do you suffer from? 'Doctor Kunjango' What is your problem? - The world has become dark. - Yes. There are no pleasures in life. He is suffering inside everyday. God! He is afraid that he will waste his whole life. Why are you so concerned about his life? The patient looks strong willed. Just one test. I will verify if there is air in your tyre. Tyre? Go, take the test. Excuse me. Madam. Looks like a food container. What is this box for? - You? - Come with me. I will... - What is the noise? - It hurts. Open the door. - Is that a woman's voice I hear? - Shut up! Why did you come here? To tell my story to the producer. Is this the place to narrate story? Why? He is a fake doctor. He will trap you for life. Open the door, come out. Escape from this place or else I will kill you. Come out. Are you conducting the test on the nurse? You dead- meat! Stop. What were you doing inside? He is an old fried, we were just having a conversation. Did you serve some hot beverage for him? You think this is some park or restaurant? Go, do your job. Get out of my face. Sir? Can we get the same treatment from her? You dead and stinky meat! Get lost. Hello. What are you doing inside? Sait is in a good mood. Better come here soon. - We open with... - You need not open anything. I will produce your movie. Okay? But there is a condition. After the movie's release, everyone should recognise me. Sure. You can't even step out of your house. Why? He didn't mean it in a bad way. We need to start the work. Can we get an advance payment? Advance, yes. That is very important Spent it sensibly. Then... Heroine is very crucial in my movie. Why don't you call Nayanthara? I think she is free now. - For this 2000 rupees? - Yes. Why? Is this not enough? - We will find a better heroine for you. - Okay. No, no. Leave me. Don't weird - Can I get your number? - Get lost. Think you can get the number and woo her? Go away. Get out of here. These chicks are hot What is it? Where are you sir? Our place has turned into a cesspool. Lord Shiva! So many girls are waiting outside for audition. But these guys are locked inside and won't open the door. What exactly are the doing inside? Cameraman sir, are we showing off to much? Yes. Let's get rid of it. Do you any previous experience? Yes, I have 5 years of experience. Very good. Who did you work with? Two years with Chidambaram. Two years with a Dubai Sheikh. Then with Reddy in Andhra... Ma'am! I asked if you have any previous experience in acting. Leave. Next. Read out the dialogue once. Action! No, no. Leave me. No, no. Leave me, leave me. I'm pleading you. You please leave us. Is this some protest rally? Leave. I wrote this dialogue with so much emotion. - This dialogue? - Yes. She must deliver it like... But you saw how she delivered it! You ask her something. No, leave me. No, you can go. None of them fits the role. I have made dry fish curry, come soon. Why are you shouting? The director is conducting audition. - Quietly leave. - Who is that director? He has not paid the house rent for three months. You call him a director? Won't these heroines come for our audition? What happened? I tried to stop, but a girl is here for audition. Who is that? Move aside. Looks very old. Will she suit the role? How dare you? I will thrash you! Why are you gasping for breath? Who is it? Sir any problem? No problem. She is also an artist. She is a realistic performer. It's his training. Damn you! Shameless guys. That was a dialogue too. Actually we can use her for the other role. She performs well. Yes, she has performed very well on you. Idiots. Sir. I feel tired. Shall we wrap up the audition for today? Why don't you play the male lead? May I come in? Selected. That is not some pickle. Don't open and lick it. Put it down. You talk. - Every night she... - Every night? Allu Arjun! This is adult talk, it may get intimate, close your ears with the dhoti. Every night... she is getting nightmares. I brought her to you because she was getting scared. Here take this paper. Tell her to draw what she saw in her dream. Give. Is everything descending together? It has come alone. It is not a local piece. It is an international piece. This is a piece that no one was able to tame; including my dad and my grandpa. I will tame it and put it in this bottle. Hello. What are you blabbering? Just make her stop dreaming. You want her to stop dreaming? Tell her to work as night watchman in a ATM. Will the nightmare go away? Even her sleep go away because of mosquitoes. Let's get out of here. He is of no use. Two mountains. A village in the middle. That is the spot. Allu Arjun. There will be an aggressive ritual. Let's go for a close shot. Sir, what should I do now? Actually... how do I tell that... Actually what I want is... You know one video we saw that day. Down I don't get it. Step forward, that is what he is trying to say in English. - Excatly. - Okay. You said your boyfriend is a film director. Does he stay in this locality? Is he a low budget movie director? No. He is making a movie like Slumdog millionaire. That is why he is staying in such a place. Move a bit to your right. Introduce me to the heroine. Damn. Come. This is Pushpa. He is the hero and producer of our movie. - Greetings. - Greetings. That's one hell of a greeting! She's been using this modulation in over 100 films, so it became her nature. 100 films? I have not seen any. - Brother. - Yes. Where is film director Bharathi sir's house? That...? He will be in that second floor. What is happening? Only you two? There were more than five girls on that day. Having food? Shall I pour sambar? Not sambar. It will upset my stomach. Hey! You heard her slang? You took money from me, right? You call this piece of trash a heroine? Get up. I said get up. Remove your hands. I said remove your hands. What is this? Show some respect, man. Respect? What respect? - What respect do you expect? - See. What happened here? Why are you shouting at Pushpa? - He's insulting me. - Wait. Sir, he is driving me mad. He talks too much. Get him out of here. It is his first movie, so he talks a lot. You leave. - Go memorize your dialogue. - Showing your true colours? Must be up here, let's go check. - What are you doing? - Shut up. Will I win an award for this performance? See if you can enter your house after this performance! This is the house. What should I do now? Shut up, she will take care. Make it more sleazy. Yes, like that. God! Get a close shot. Sir, your girlfriend. Why are reminding me of her now? Sir, your girlfriend is behind you. Damn. What shall we do now? Open the door. Open it. Release me. - You! - Where did I keep the key? What is that receptionist doing here? Release me from this chain. - The keys are lost. - Keys are lost? Untie me from this. I will kill you if I come in. Open the door. The keys are lost. Are you going to open or not? - They are definitely up to something. - Open the door! Will you open or not? Change of scene. Please open door. Open it. Nobody can escape from the law. You! She is hitting for real. Okay, walk a bit to that side. Now put up an angry face and act like a police. Sowmya! What are you doing here? Must be here to see the shooting. They haven't seen one right? Yes. Shut up. Sowmya! When we first saw, the cot was lying flat. But now, it's standing straight. Come. Stand. See now, does it look flat? Look now. Does it look upright. - Yes. - What do you know about camera angles? Meet our hero, Pushpalal Sait. Greetings. Really? She is our heroine, Alagu Meena. This is her first Tamil movie. She has done many Bollywood movies. Greetings! Damn! I forgot about this. Get lost. Sowmya... Sowmya... I will change the scene if you don't like it. Stop acting. I know that you are doing something wrong. I will crush you when I find out about it. I was just making a movie. - Come on. - I will crush you. - I have a great scene for you. - Get lost! Seems like everyone wants to crush you. Shall we change the location? How about a song sequence? "He saw through me with his piercing eyes" "He charmed me with a solitary smile" "In my ever lush and exotic garden" "He sprinkled the elixir of shyness" "He brought flowers to adorn on my hair bun" "He brought honey to spread on my fabulous skin" "I clad this sultry silk saree to woo him" "He grabbed the blooming flower by its stem" "This bed of flower longs for a sweetheart" "Come my dear and take my breath away" "In this night of eternal stars" "Pick your favourites and make them dance to your tune" "Do not hesitate to make me sweat" "Sway your kitty bag in the air" "I will give you no excuses" "I will give you my everything" "He saw through me with his piercing eyes" "He charmed me with a solitary smile" "In my ever lush and exotic garden" "He sprinkled the elixir of shyness" This bar has quite a different set up. (Chanting) Cameraman sir! Where did he go? Please, it was an honest mistake! Please, let go of me! Please! Please, let go of me. There he is. My bad! Please! - Sir! Sir! Please help me! - I was looking for you everywhere! And here you are playing Kabbadi with them. Does it really look like I'm playing Kabaddi? Please save me, sir! - Let go of him! - Save me, sir.

You guys are showing up outta no where! Sir, here. Hey! Come. Come on. Fools! Get lost! Come on. Run, sir! Hey! Take this! Sir, let's hope they don't come back. What's so funny? They way you ran and tried to escape when they chased you... - It was so funny! - He creates all the trouble and now... You talk as if you bashed 10 of them like John Wick! I've decided. - Decided what, sir? - Not to continue with you. Take your things and leave. Why must I leave, sir? I have equal share in this house as much as you do, sir. - Share? - Yes We have never paid advance or rent! Then on what grounds are you talking about share? Wait. Remember I cleaned up when owner's grandson took a dump? On those grounds! Then stay here and clean for the house owner too. I'm leaving. Well, sir. To err is human. Why get upset over it? Your anger is justified. So, just leave. Oh, come on! How can I be angry on you, sir? How dare they lay hands on you, sir? If I was my younger self... I'd have bashed those lunatics! God! Sir... Just a power cut. - Don't leave me alone, sir. - Show off! I'll be back, wait! Come on, sir. Let's drink. Descend on me younger Bharathi! - Come on! Descend on me! - You almost finished it? Is it?

Was she wearing a churidhar or... He is living the character, sir! There she is. Ask her. Sir... it's pitch dark. Which direction do we go from here? Go straight. Head east, then turn left. Sir, Google map says take left. Forget that wretch! You go straight. Shut up and go left! Sir, where did she go? Sir, let's go this way and search. 'Anacondapuram' What is he trying to convey? What is it? Come here. Come on, sir. What's the rush? What are you trying to convey? Where do you want us to come? We don't understand a zilch! What do you take us for? Wait and watch now! How dare you show such vulgar actions! Ladies, what happened? What's that noise? Katirna Kaif and Murugesan's wife! Stop it! Stop it, ladies! Poor fellow. He already looks like a cucumber smothered by a dog. - Why are you hitting him? - Guess what he asked us? Stop it! What did you do to provoke them? Oh my God! Our lives are ruined! What do you mean? Don't you understand? - Tell us what is the matter, first! - Some three guys crossed over the hill! Where is she going with that chicken? To prepare Biriyani! Shut up and follow! What do we do now? We don't have to do anything. It will screw us royally, now. By any chance, if someone wakes up that spirit... then it'll destroy all of you! These guys usually film inside closed rooms. Shooting in this palace will cost me a lot I guess. Should we take all these risks for that dumb girl? Sir... It is too dark. - Shall we go in? - Are you going to listen if I say no? Spiderman's spirit might be here I guess. Don't invite the ghosts with your poor jokes. Shut up and walk. Sir... Do you have a lighter? Bhavana! She looks hot. Must have made her our heroine. What is this? Looks kind of weird. They have made a wild buffalo sit on the throne. It's pitch dark. Where did these two go? Pushpa? Hello. Hello. Buffalo sir. My King! It is me. Your Bhavana. Please, I am not worth it. Please don't do it. I told you right? I am not worth it. Look how she is lying. Soumy... Why are you sleeping here? Wake up. Damn it! Come on. Come. Hurry up. - Where am I now? - Come on. You woke up the sleeping spirit and run before all of us? Hurry up, Pushpa. Forget him, sir. Stop tailing us. Wait up. - Sorry brother, house full. - Open the door. Don't leave your Producer out. Bald Priest! Come here everyone. Soothsayer! Tell your village people to stand separately. All the villagers, stand separately. Who are they? You know what these people did? The went into the palace behind the hills. The evil spirit which you have awakened; did you think she's Devasena from Bhahubali? She's Mayasena! Do you even have any idea about her? Thousand years ago... Our soldiers back look very weak! Even the rusty swords must be sharpened. Commander, is this the kingdom? Give me that binocular. Wow! A beautiful, amazing, humongous and wonderful palace! I've never seen such a palace in my life. Where is our spy who gave us the information? Dear spy! Here's your prize! Go on a vacation with your family. Even the neighbourhood spy realized that I'll take over this kingdom. That's impossible, my lord! Well, there you go! Can't you keep your stinking mouth shut? Why are you always interested in saying negative things? Why is it impossible? This kingdom is called Anacondapuram. It is not ruled by a king... It is ruled by a queen and her name is Mayasena. Now, that's information! A good one! You will get your salary this month. Based on what you said, taking over that kingdom is a walk in the park! After all she's a woman! I've heard a lot about this Anacondapuram kingdom. What have you heard? Many kings came with their army to capture it. But none of them could capture it. I'm sure there must be some reason behind it. You walk around like a fool, trying to find out that reason. Meanwhile, I'll capture it and return victorious. Soldiers, set up the tents! We shall capture Anacondapuram tomorrow morning! Geru Khan vs Mayasena; let's see who win! Who are you? Amidst such a huge army... who is safe guarding you, yet I have you at knife point. Don't you still realize... who am I? Maya! Mayasena! Where is she? Fools! Where are you? Come here! Where is the Commander? I'm here, my Lord. What happened? Commander, she came in my dreams and had me at knife point! It wasn't a dream, my Lord. She came here for real! Blood! She crossed over a whole army, sneaked in to my palace... and have shed blood from my throat! So, what must be my reply? - Be decent and stay calm. - That's more like your coward legacy! That's not Geru Khan's legacy! Like her, I'll sneak, all by myself, into her palace... have her at knife point and draw her blood! That would make me proud! Why hasn't the king returned yet? The king hasn't returned, which means something has happened to him. Soldiers! Get the army ready! We might have to break into that palace at any moment. God! She disfigured my sword and kicked me out! Ouch. Oh my God! God! What happened, my Lord? How could you fall? Commander... your words were true! You told me I cannot finish her off, instead she finished me off. Stop blabbering, my Lord! Did they attack you? Tell me! I shall barge in with our army and attack them! Not just our army, but no army in this world can defeat her! - Does she have special spears or swords? - No. Or does she have any modern weapon? Come closer! She has a unique and different weapon all together! Oh Lord Sun, you must take care of our kingdom and it's subjects. Where's Raja Guru? Where is he? What he is doing at the top? Raja Guru! The sun is rising on the other side. Then what are you searching this side? Mr. Raja Guru! Geru Khan is coming with his army to wage war against us. He is coming to hunt down this palace and capture our kingdom! You get sloshed and wasted at night... and then rush late in the morning talking about Geru Khan and Shahrukh Khan? That spray mouthed fellow already came last night. He was no match to our queen and he sprinted away. He sprinted away? - I heard he's a great warrior. - Great warrior? As if he killed many lions and tigers! His will lose against our queen. Is our queen such a great warrior? What exactly did happened here last night? Please tell me that great story. Let me narrate the story of my queen. Listen! Mayasena! How dare you hold me at knife point? Geru Khan is here! Come out! - Who are these dummies? - This guy, you see? I say he'll return. I bet 1000 Gold coins. He won't return. 2000 Gold coins! Gambling fools! I'll finish off your queen first and then I'll turn you both into corpses. Maya! Where are you hiding? I'll finish you off today! Where are you? Where are the servants, ministers, advisors and others? Can't find anyone! So, am I the one paying and filling up my palace with workers, for no use? Who is it? Blood! Maya! Are you sending me a warning? This Geru Khan won't retreat for such warnings! Geru Khan has arrived! Did you hide after knowing that I'm coming? Where are you? Come out! Geru Khan dropped his jaws and went behind her. She put off the lamp. As a one sided lover of hers, I was helpless. I shut the door and returned. This the great story of our queen. I am ashamed to be a part of ministers here! On top, he has his eyes set on the queen. Please, don't insult my love. Wonder what her situation was last night? That's why she lost herself. Aren't you ashamed to say this? Minister, all these are quite common in our court. I will stab you with this! - Listen to me. - Raja Guru... What is it? - Queen has summoned you. - Come, let's find out why. Minister, so you now know how she looks during the night. You haven't seen her during the day, right? During the day... How she'll look? Have you seen her during the day? Can I also get a chance to see her? She will look very traditional during the day. Jerk! Peverted fellow! Come on, now! Even in game she will only attack the men! Be quiet. You were right. She indeed looks traditional. Shut up! This is the first time I'm seeing her in that attire. Queen, I'm disappointed that of late you are wearing very decent clothes. - Rajaguru! - What? Did you arrange for what our queen had ordered? - What arrangements? - Correct! What arrangements? Don't call yourself the hand of the queen! And on top, a minister to assist you! Fool! Aren't you ashamed? Only your paunch is growing but not your brain! You crazy woman! Why are you scolding me now? We asked you to bring in warriors who can match our queen's strength! - Where are they? - For what? - For our queen to play. - To play? Don't you both have any work? Take her name and every men in village run away like cowards! Then where will I get warriors from? She is calling me? She will unleash hell with her whip. Now she has a stick in her hand. What does it mean? If you don't get the warriors, then queen will be playing with both your heads. Being a queen means she has no limits? I didn't know I'm working in 'Death' department. Come on, minister. I'm starving since morning and I'm feeling dizzy now. We must bring in warriors and arrange them to play with her? Raja Guru, don't you understand what she means by that? I understand. They are asking us to... Raja Guru, don't you ever get angry? I did get angry once! But my love for her blinded my eyes. Pimping is better that this! Don't remind me of your previous profession. Listen... did you notice? She never looked directly in to my eyes. - For that you must look smart. - Mr. Aamir Khan, that's not the reason! It is because she feels shy to look into my eyes and talk. To make her every wish come true is my duty! Come, let's find out. And so, we would like to announce to this village that... every warrior here is ordered to come to the palace to play with the queen. And it's an order from the queen herself! All windows are shut yet I can hear the echo. Oh! Is that some kinda squeezing sound? Forget it, Raja Guru. Guess that's what she wished for tonight. Stop irritating me! The lucky fellow is getting lucky... and the unlucky must shut up and mind his business. You don't know about our queen. Let me show you how lucky he's getting. Come on. Look. Oh, the same noise is made while whipping lashes too? That's my queen! Have you ever got lashes like this? I'm wandering around this palace for that sole opportunity. Look how she's unleashing hell upon him. I watch this quite often. Now, you watch. How can she be so cruel? Listen, you hardly know anything about the queen. If you really wanna know about her, then first you must know about her father. Queen's father, who was once the king who ruled this kingdom. Instead of serving the people, he was only quenching his lust. He was a hardcore pervert! Any girl who fell in his sight, never escaped from him. All the atrocities he did everyday... was noticed by Mayasena. He didn't even spare his daughter's nanny. He turned a homely looking nanny into a screwed up zombie! Looking at the nanny who fed her, Mayasena cried her heart out. He was such a cheap fellow who'd never change! He continued his fantasy life. Mayasena noticed all this... and she directed the anger towards her father on to the whole male species! Then queen started her revolt. Every men in the kingdom ran for their life! Any man who opposed the queen, was tied up and skinned alive! He sired a devil instead of a daughter! Stop! How were you present then? You doofus! That's not me. That's my father - Jalsa Sathish. Hear out the story completely! Looks like as if he's sleeping on top of a volcano! Mr. King! You call her your daughter? You are far better than her! She is a menace! Wait, hold that thought. Why hasn't Bhavana arrived yet? I'll remove your footwear and hit you! You wanna play swing on a drumstick tree? So what if the tree is old... the roots are still strong. I'll take an axe and cut it down! Is this how you rule a kingdom? Neighbouring kings are spitting on my face. Then wipe it and move on! You can do that but I can't! Fine, then just tell me what are you here for? Finally! Do something about your daughter's atrocities! There is no fault of hers. Then whose fault it is? It's a curse because of my doings. She was born with a curse. That is why she is behaving like this. There are lot of good stories from old books. You could've raised her telling those stories. You ruined her life with your naughty stories! Rascal! He's coughing but doesn't seems to die! I drink heavily every night pondering over the woes of all men in our kingdom! I spend 10,000 every night! Fine, what would you do if she was your daughter? If she was my daughter then I'd poison her and then set her ablaze! Then do it. My king! Are you asking me to kill your daughter? Stop your drama! Isn't that what you wanted? Now go! Damn! I misunderstood this pure soul. Go and ask Bhavana to come at once! Bhavana? You deserve to be slippered again and again! Nothing wrong in it! King or beggar; learn to raise a daughter properly! Or don't have children. I hear that you're one of the best artist. Is it true? Whoa! Amazing! That's an excellent portrait of me. You're indeed a great artist. But then... I am an artist too. Now, watch me sketch your portrait. You don't look the same in the portrait. But that's not my fault. I blame the brushes! So what? Guards! In the future, nobody should every look back into my history and say that I'm a bad artist. Observe how he looks in this portrait... and I want you soldiers to ensure that he looks exactly like this. - Queen, this is unfair! Let go of me. - Take him! My princess... the king has summoned you. Tell him, I'm on my way. What do you see in it? The Empress of this country. So... You have not realized that you are a woman yet. Bring the food. Do not care that she is my daughter. Kill her! "Here comes the brave Maya!" "Here comes the brave Maya!" "A wizard" "Mayasena" "Wield the sword of courage" "A sorcerer" "Mayasena" "Overcome the deep sky!" "Here comes the brave Maya!" "Here comes the brave Maya!" "Here comes the brave Maya!" "Here comes the brave Maya!" You deserve to die Maya! Only then the kingdom will be safe. I deserve to die? If I deserve to die... then a person like you... must never have been born! "A Queen is she, so mighty-ly" "No more defeat, she'll never cease" "Back down you can't, already deemed" "To be beneath commanding feet" "A wizard" "Mayasena!" "The sword of courage" "Wield it" "A sorcerer" "Mayasena" "The deep sky" "Overcome it" "Fire, she burns anything" "In her path; believe! You will never sleep" "Watch for when she takes her throne" "And vows her foes to die alone" "I am a sweet fire" "I am a lethal sword" "I am a flower which bleeds" "There is no other" "No one who dares to stand..." "Stand against you" "No one can" "A wizard" "Mayasena" "The deep sky" "Overcome it" "She is the monster with the sword" "She holds the scepter of power" "I am demon Raavanan's sister" "My rage will conquer everything" "A wizard" "Mayasena" "The deep sky" "Overcome it" She killed her own father. She is a pure evil. She did not kill her father alone. She took my father's head from the plate and hung it in the palace entrance. She inscribed 'Look at me to prosper' under it. -But why? -To cast away evil eyes. That is brilliant of her. I am pretending to love her just to get my revenge on her. You have seen me as a comedian. Now you will see me as a villain. Minister, if we miss it today, our heads will be served in a plate. What is she doing? She is enjoying the music as if it is played by Anirudh. This guy used to chariot mechanic, but now he is a Tabla player! I brought him here because he is my relative. But he is irritating me. It's been an hour. Why are they not here yet? Damn this guy. Did they run away with the gold coins I paid them? Who are you? We are coming from far away. You must speak only the truth. If you lie, your heads will not be yours. Well, we are artists. We travel to different parts of world and perform. We are here to perform. Hope you will allow us, O Queen. Lie! It is the truth, my Queen. Lie! I swear, we are here to perform. Why are you begging her? How can she catch such a big spear with eyes closed? - Did she find out that it is your plan? - Shut up! I am not at all involved in this. Tell her. You tell her. God, she's isn't uttering a word! I know. "Here comes the brave Maya!" "Here comes the brave Maya!" Thank God. When Queen reign was flourishing, a new character made his entry! What notice is this? "The lust stories of the Queen" Wow! "The lust stories of the Queen" Venue: Near Parangimalai. In Jothi's tent. Yours truly, Storyteller. Quick! Story started. The Storyteller has escaped my Queen. Where is that Storyteller? Was the story good? Her hate for him turned into rage. She searched for him everywhere. "Oh people of my village, hear the story" "There was once a gorgeous Queen" "Oh people of my village, hear the story" "There was once a gorgeous Queen" "No man will dare to enter her fortress" "But a brave warrior entered to wage a sword fight" "The warrior who went to the fair Queen's fort" "Went past the gate and found his way in" "He sneaked his way in" "A ravishing dress covered one half and her skin covered the rest" "She was lost in a deep sleep" "She rested her hands on his unassuming shoulder" "Oh people of my village, hear the story" "There was once a gorgeous Queen" "Oh people of my village, hear the story" "There was once a gorgeous Queen" Stop it! Drag him out. Narrate the remaining story. "The warrior wielding a magic wand" "Seduced the mighty Queen" "Trapped her in his charm" "He spent the whole night with the Queen" "It started as a fight but..." "He lost himself to her and she surrendered herself to him" "Oh people of my village, hear the story" "There was once a gorgeous Queen" "Oh people of my village, hear the story" "There was once a gorgeous Queen" No one was able to defeat the Queen till then. But while she was mesmerized in your erotic story, they killed her. Only in her last moments that she realized, that it was Raja Guru's plot to get her through you. He did not spare you either. He killed you too. Where is my good news? - Raja Guru. - What? - I have an idea. - Tell. Suppose if the Queen escapes, she will chop your head and hang it in public, just like your father. I get it. You want her to chop my head so that you can get the throne. Shut up you 'stove-faced' minister. I am dying in anxiety and you are asking me questions? Why is my good news not here yet? Kudos! The Queen is no more. I am the King of Anacondapuram from now. I will be known as the man who saved the race and pride of men. He buried her alive. But her curse destroyed the entire kingdom. In the ruins of that fallen kingdom, thousand years ago... you belonged to a family of erotic story tellers. Only you can stop the queen with your erotic story. Terrified? It will be more terrifying from here-on. So, it has been your family business for generations. Stop it sir. This is your village's problem. You deal with it. See you. No one will step out of this village. Don't be scared. Today is a new moon day. Before the Queen's spirit gets furious, I will perform a great ritual. That ritual will destroy the Queen and save you. (Chanting mantras) What cream, priest? Bring me a silver lamp. Silver lamp? Give me a second. We must travel 80 kilometers to buy a silver lamp. Manage with this lamp for now. Alright. At least give me a coconut. Here. What is this? One half is here, but where is the other? I used it to make chutney this morning. You made chutney from it? Please let me go priest. Sit down. Please compromise priest. Listen. Occasional compromises are fine. But constant compromises are not. You people are the worst. You don't realize the seriousness. Do you want coconut oil for hair? Idiots! This is the most important stage. I need the blood of a chaste girl. Why are they blinking? You don't understand? I need the blood of a virgin girl. - Blood? - What? Only then, we can destroy the Queen and save him. Come quick. Bring it. I can tell from their faces that I'm not getting the blood. Priest, my Sowmya will donate her blood for me. Why bother asking the others? Sowmya. I am so sorry, my blood will be of no use to you. Great. Give me a second, I will check with my friend. A friend? Call her, call her soon. Hi, tell me. Sri, I need your blood. It's urgent. Blood? Why? We need a virgin's blood. That is why I called you. Oh Jeez! You must have asked me yesterday. Just today morning Shiva came to my home Game over! You are such a disgrace. This is not going to work. Priest, will a virgin goat's blood work? You fool! Should I make a curry with goat's blood? Stop demeaning my ritual. This ritual is a farce. You better leave. These people will learn only after dying a gruesome death at the Queen's hands. Priest... Him again? When will the queen come here? - I will... - Hey kid! - Who is that? - Move aside. Who is this ancient piece? Take my blood. Will she survive after that? Take my blood. If the oldest women in this village is a virgin, I feel sorry for you guys. Go inside without fear. I will take care of things from here. Sir. All the best. All the best! Back to the same place again. Madam. I am not worthy enough for you to haunt me. If you can appear before me, we can talk this out. Narrate me the remaining story. Story? What story? What story might it be? I don't have the heart to beat you up. Narrate me the remaining part of your story. Now! Madam, I have only one story with me. Shall I tell that to you? Two wet clothes are drying outside a house. At that time, inside the house... Hello, did she come? She is coming. She is asking me to narrate a story. What story should I tell her? Is she going to produce your movie? Just tell me if she's there. Hug her and give a long kiss. Are you really a holy man? Don't beat him. Girl. Our whole ritual is dependent on that kiss. Kiss her! Give her a kiss! - Just kiss her. - Kiss. This is a great opportunity. You! Kiss her now. Damn, she has disappeared again. Where is she? Hello. Excuse me. Hope she won't hit me. Ma'am. Now activate plan B! Listen... Let's not do it. No feelings. Apply the ritual blood on her face. Please! What wrong did she do? She is crying. I will not do it. Hey! What is happening there? Why is it silent? Come on. Come. Come on! Come to me and give a tight hug. Enough of hugging her Mr Director. Come here. You think this new story will work? Kind of. Was the ghost wearing a saree or churidhar? It doesn't matter. It already humiliated you. Where is he? You jerks! It is an ungrateful world! Who are you? "Oh my ghost! Oh my ghost!" "Oh my ghost! Oh my ghost!" "Oh my ghost! Oh my ghost!" "Oh my ghost! Oh my ghost!" "Bold and the beauty, you are a rocking sensation" "You effortlessly sweep away our heart" "Smooth and sleek, you are a dancing beauty" "Will you fulfill our desires?" "Oh Sunny!

"I stuck your photo in my house" "I kissed it a million times everyday" "You have occupied my entire heart " "I will let no one come between us" "You are the best of the best" "Your fragrant skin, shall I be its keeper" "Back in the bar..." "None of the alcohol gave me the kick" "But when you swung your hip, it got me high" "None of the alcohol gave me the kick" "But when you swung your hip, it got me high" "Bold and the beauty, you are a rocking sensation" "You effortlessly sweep away our heart" "Smooth and sleek, you are a dancing beauty" "Will you fulfill our desires?" "Oh my ghost! Oh my ghost!" "Oh my ghost! Oh my ghost!" "Bold and the beauty, you are a rocking sensation" "You effortlessly sweep away our heart" "Smooth and sleek, you are a dancing beauty" "Will you fulfill our desires?"
