Turn right. Give me a cigarette. Right curve. Then go straight at full speed. Slippery for next 200 meters. Watch for the ice on your left. Watch for the ice in Valberg. - The snow looks wet. - OK. Roger. How's the car? Change the sparkplugs, distributor and the brackets. Get me sparkplugs, a distributor and STP. Keep the speed high! We can't; the snow is wet in Valberg. If you make the top three, I'll recommend you for the factory team. How about it? Don't worry, I know this area. We're the service unit of the factory team. - What? - Shut up! We'll have the part at the next point. We can make it. #24 Pierre Leduc has passed the control in Beuil. Japanese driver #9, Godai is buzzing right along... What's wrong? I can't draw. I'm turning off the radio. Don't, leave it on. You're pretty. After all, he's racing - you're a bad wife. Sharp left hand bend. Sharp left hand bend. Next, curve right. Then straight ahead. Dammit! Full speed! Three-phase downshift. Right curve, then left. Then you're fine. Soft right. Tunnel ahead. Righthand bend. Sharp left. Careful, downshift. - Yuko. - Thanks. Left curve, past the field. Hairpin turn, right. Two-phase downshift. Just look at the map. We're off the timing - too fast! Don't worry! There's a bit of bad news, Godai appears to have been in a serious accident... He knew it was impossible, and he didn't replace his broken parts! - He's an irresponsible man! - Please, Pierre! Were you trying to kill Godai?! He trusted you! Please, stop! The reason I didn't sign with an automaker in the first place... is because I didn't want to sell my freedom for money! But that's exactly what happened! It's all turned to shit! Get out of here! The Gipsy Crew is finished! Juma isn't coming. Pierre. Yes. Yes… Yuko… You should sleep. I'll call later. Good night. How is he? Let's go. You go ahead. Anna... There's nothing we can do. Godai will probably die. What can I do?! Really?! You've been saying the same thing for 10 years now! I can't take it anymore! Living out of a car year round! The smell of gasoline! Worrying that you'll crash... - Anna… - Let me go back to Lyon. I'll be 40 soon. I don't want to die in that trailer. I want an ordinary life. No! Anna! Godai, I'm Yamazaki of the secretarial department. I'll make a hotel reservation for you. I have your itinerary here. Please, get in. Please, get in. I'll see you later. You left Japan because of the incident with track obstacles at the First Annual Japan G.P., right? You've been in international races for some time: what do you think of Japan's racing scene? Do you think that miniskirts and bellbottoms will dominate women's fashion this year? - Yes. - You're lucky to be alive. The Japanese press reported you dead. How did it feel? - How did what feel? - When you died? I'm alive. Godai, why don't you get married? Married? You've been living together for three years. Don't you think it's odd? Are you leaving? Yes, I'll be done in two days or so. Done with what? I'll take you back to the hotel. What'll you do when the Japan Grand Prix is over? You can't hide it, I can guess. I saw the racing calendar. When the Japan Grand Prix is finished, you'll go to Austria for the Belgrade race. Next is the Netherlands, then Spain in October for the Spanish Grand Prix. Nothing has changed. Not Japan, not you, not anything. Jacques! Yes, that is traditional Japanese clothing. Irrespective of the place or the age, I think this represents the most beautiful crystallization of art and love. How very interesting. It's an opinion very typical of Mr. Chabrol. Ladies and gentlemen, Jacques Chabrol, the so-called "Wizard of Fashion", is visiting Japan… Frustration with Tariff Cuts Demands for Strong Capital Liberalization Rushed Tariff Cuts, Liberalization Over here, please. Mr. Godai, this is Director Takase. He's been your most vocal supporter. - Pleased to meet you, I'm Godai. - I'm Takase. Have a seat. I'm glad to see that you made it back in one piece. Here are the results of my physical examination. No need, the doctor already said that your health was fine. An ordinary man would have given up the ghost. Not to waste any time, I have someone for you to meet. - Yamazaki, get everything ready. - Yes, sir. When my friends from the UAC came for a visit, this is how I showed them Tokyo. I'll introduce you. This is the Japan Grand Prix Commissioner and the Special Testing Director… - Long time, no see, Takeuchi. - I heard about Monte Carlo. I'm glad to see you're still alive. - You already know each other? - Yes. Godai, the maximum is 9,000 rpm. - The third corner is a bit tight, so watch yourself. - OK. - Is it ready to go, Eto? - Yes. - Is your body positioned all right? - Just fine. - You were right to recommend him. - I know. - Eto, check his time. - OK. Zoinks! He beat Minagawa's record by 26 seconds! The Jacques Chabrol Spring-Summer Collection Tokyo Department Store Could you please say a few words? Mr. Matsuoka. The fans just want to see your face. That alone will be advertising enough. All of the designers visiting Japan have done it. Sir, if you would make an appearance on the stage... It's my work that I want people to see. I didn't come to Japan as a salesman. No! It's wonderful. - How's Godai? - He's fine. Why did you come back to Japan? Are you no longer a gypsy? You should keep working. Why did you leave me, Yuko? I wonder if you truly believe in yourself. Let's go. Mr. Godai... Yuko isn't going with you. I'm sorry. Let's go. Goodbye. Your talent has not withered. Why don't you work with me? Promise me. I'll speak with Godai. Will you promise? - Eto. - Yes? It was exactly three years ago at the Japan Grand Prix. I was in a dead heat with Takeuchi. I was driving a Porsche 906. He was in a Nissan R380. In the second to last lap, I passed Takeuchi on the inside lane to take the lead. At that moment, he collided with me from behind. His vehicle disappeared at the 30 degree banking. I floored the pedal and passed the checkered flag. An ambulance took him to the hospital. He had severed a nerve in his right arm. The Commission met. They decided that the accident was caused by my blocking his vehicle. I was disqualified, and jeered at by fans as a coward. I didn't block his vehicle. I saw a lot of different ways to block in Europe in my three years there. This was different. When you lose on skill, you go down. Technique means besting yourself. Why are you telling me this? As of today, my life is in your hands. That's why. Oh, you're back. I don't want any outside calls. And I'd like a wake-up call at 9:00. Good night. You're in high spirits. The training camp starts tomorrow. I won't be back for a while. You're cool. You groupie. Do you want to come? Jacques was mad because I drank too much, but you're kind. Jacques? Do you think it's good to be kind? Jacques Chabrol is in Japan? Yes, you seem surprised. You're not surprised. You're not the type. He was once my lover. And now he's in Japan. Don't you want me? Practice starts tomorrow. I'll go to Kyoto with Jacques. Don't you care?! I wish I could die! What's happened to me?! It's strange... The Japanese circuit is identical to the one in Europe. Say hello to him for me. Okay. I might go on a trip when work is done in Kyoto. That sounds like a good idea. Anna is coming. Anna? When? With Pierre's factory team for the Japan Grand Prix. - Pierre? - It surprised me, too. I thought he wanted to be free. Mr. Godai. Eto will take you to the station. - Take it. - I don't need it. I want to see Anna. She'll be here until the Grand Prix ends. After Kyoto, will you be coming back? Godai. I figured you'd be here. Three years ago, you were in the R380. When you disappeared from my rearview mirror on this 30 degree banking… Ever since then, when I raced in Europe, - I always watch the mirrors. - Don't talk trash. You're supposed to be the coolest man in Japan. In Monte Carlo, when I was barely clinging to life, I thought to myself that if I could ever race again, I'd like to try it here again first. If I could perform perfectly, I could drive away the specter of my past with you. If you look at how the UAC team works, the people who stripped you of your title second guess themselves, too. I wonder what tricks the UAC has up its sleeves. As the capital deregulation of the auto industry approaches, this year's Grand Prix is said to be the showdown between US and Japanese cars. Preliminaries a Day Before the Japan Grand Prix... to Determine the Starting Order for the Race Not just one or two, but over and over and over. - Check the pedals. - Okay. I understand. Japan is lovely. Why did you go to Europe? You're lucky. Why? Pierre loves you. You think so? Doesn't he? I have regrets. Why? I tried to change him. 5 Minutes to Start The 31 vehicles that passed the preliminary races are now in position to start. Car #26, Duncan of the UAC is on pole position. Also in the front row are Car #25, UAC Pierre Leduc, and... Car #27, UAC front runner Reagan. The Japanese hope, Car #19, Takayuki Godai... he's in the Nissan R381 and took second position. A long time ago... we had dreams. To have babies, and to have homes. It hasn't been easy for him. I've put up with this for 12 years. It's true. Me, too, Anna... The life of a woman is so meaningless. 3 Minutes to Race The race will start in three minutes. 2 Minutes to Race You're coming, I hope. You must act. I know. Why do you hesitate? Life is fleeting. Come with me. You're beautiful... You're talented. You will take Paris by storm. Paris will love you. I will as well. Yuko. 1 Minute to Race - They're a little early. - The UAC appears to be in the lead. We've no word from the Meteorological Agency yet. It's expected to rain in some parts of the mountains. - We'll wait and see. - Okay. - Eto, get out the rain tires. - Right. - Tell every pit crew to do the same. - Will do. Godai is at 1:52. How's the engine? - Check the steering. - Got it. - Godai. - Thanks. Pierre is in the pit. He's got his eye on you. Be careful. Gasoline, OK. I want to be first to the checkered flag, and I can make it! What about Duncan! He's already out! Ramp up the RPMs a notch, OK? Start the engine! Go! - Okay! - Off we go! Yuko, don't you love Godai any more? Mr. Takeuchi, did you see the sign just now? Great, they're making a pit stop! Director, one of their vehicles is out of commission. Don't change the pace. Frank Reagan is the only one left. Eto, get the pit board ready. Godai. Takeuchi, I drove away your specter. You were spectacular. I have a favor to ask... Could you wait just three days before you take off for Europe? You're the only one who can do this. Will you wait? Don't touch me. If you touch me again, I'll kill you! What are you saying? You should go to bed, Pierre. Are you all right? You don't understand. Ask Godai... Ask him what I did. What happened today? Let's break it off. We're not good for each other. He said, "Let's break it off, Anna. We're not good for each other. "It's for the best." Okay, Pierre. If that's what you want. But I just want one thing... "OK, Pierre. Let's break up." I'd like you to know something. I always wanted a tranquil life. I never wanted to be that kind of woman. That's all. "I just wanted a quiet life. "But you couldn't give me that. "I couldn't have children... I couldn't even have a house. "Even if I leave you, "It's not because I don't love you anymore." - Key, please. - We have a message for you, sir. I have to make a phone call. I see... I'll be right over. I'll be right back. "I just wanted a tranquil life." Have a seat. I saw. Champion of the UAC Japan Grand Prix Formidable Japan Racer Beaten!! L'ambre coffee. I'm not a man given to idle pursuits. Except this. Thanks for the coffee. I'd like you to drive in the East African Safari Rally, Godai. The East African Safari Rally? I'm quite sure that the UAC will be entering next year. Their model will probably be the UK UAC Ford Escort Twin Cam. As you must know, this is a top-notch vehicle. - Nomura! - Yes. This is the East African Safari Rally team manager, Nomura. - Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. This is our chief technician, Nishijima. The rally isn't until next April, so you have plenty of time. Mr. Godai, I certainly hope you will join our team. We loved you in the Japan Grand Prix. Please look over this information. I see. Then you'll be racing in the East African Safari Rally? You've been dreaming of this for a long time. No one can stop you. When are you leaving? Maybe… How long will you be away? Two months? It'll be longer than that. Three? Five? No, even longer. Hey, Yuko... I… …want to wait, but I can't. I've taken everything from you: your job, your happiness... And in return, I've given you… Stifling loneliness, the stench of gasoline, and the life of a gypsy in a trailer. I was just talking to Jacques about it on the telephone. I can't take it anymore. I give up. Yuko... I can't pass up this chance. This an announcement for JAL flight departures. The deadline for embarkation procedures for flight 431 to Paris... will expire momentarily. Customers who have not yet completed these procedures should do so immediately. Please send the address of the Kenyan driver Juma Kingoli --East African Motor Sports Federation INTERMISSION Nairobi Port of Mombasa Kilimanjaro Godai, that could be the UAC! - Right, shut the windows. - OK. Hang on, Eto. Eto, this is the only way to handle the dry part of the race. It's the safest bet. And the most dangerous. But what if he slams on his breaks? I'll be breaking the whole time. Godai, it's the UAC. It's the Ford Escort Twin Cam. - Eto, it's time. Get ready. - Okay. Day of Drawing for Starting Order The grueling 5,000km, 5-day Rally crosses through Kenya and Uganda in Eastern Africa. The starting order for the race will be determined by lots. The first leg of the race, where the course heads north, is to start in Nairobi. This portion encompasses 2,500km, with 21 control points. Each driver will receive a time card at each control point, and one point will be deducted for each minute the car is late. Drivers must arrive in the Ugandan capital of Kampala with no more than 240 penalty points. The driver will be allowed 10 hours of rest. Then, he will enter the Southern leg of the race. Fewer than 10 cars are expected to make it back to Nairobi. The East African Safari Rally is called the "car breaker", and was conceived for the sole purpose of destroying vehicles. For the drivers, the luck of the draw will have a significant bearing... on their performance in the race. If the rain should happen to muddy unpaved roads, no provisions will be made for cars in the lead... that rut or otherwise mar the racing course. One-by-one the drivers' lots were drawn. The Simonyan-Neylan Nissan driving team is designated fourth. The Saunders-Petring team is #20. The Walton-McConnell team is #36. Still, even after 60th and 70th places were picked, Godai and Juma's names had not been drawn. The real problem is... the gap between the lead and 90th place is so wide. The head mechanic will explain the issue. Mr. Nomura! Are you giving up on Mr. Godai? Team Godai has done everything it can to prepare for this race! Do you expect him to pack spare tires, autoparts... and gasoline in his trunk?! Mr. Godai, for the factory team - - for any factory team - winning is the only thing that matters. So, we'll do everything in our power to get all three cars past the finish line. Eto evidently plans to service both you and the Walton-McConnell Team. But that's impossible. There will be a 2-hour gap between Cars #36 and #90. That means that when you start, the Saunders-Petring team... will already be 140 miles away. It's not impossible. I'll explain. If Eto services #36 and then #90 in Busia, there will be a 1:42 lag. However, slow traffic will delay the race by one hour in Kampala, During that time, Eto's car can go from Kampala all the way to Kabale. Covering 400 miles at a speed of 60mph... will allow Godai to take the lead. One Day Before the Race Entry to closed areas is strictly prohibited. Drivers must also be careful to comply with speed limits. And, of course, don't cause any accidents. - Be careful. - See you in Kampala. - Give 'em hell! - You can do it! Day of the Race This sucks, I wanted to see the start. - Eto, I'm going. - OK. - Be careful. - I will. 3:55pm 4:00pm: First Car Starts 2-minute Interval Between Cars 4:04pm Third Car Starts I'm connecting you with Nairobi. Hello, Godai? This is Takase. Oh, hello. This is Godai. I'm just about to leave. Fortunately this year has been unusually dry. The only rain has been in Northern Uganda. Please don't take unnecessary risks. I won't, don't worry. Good, then I'll look forward to hearing from you happy and healthy in five days. I'll talk to you then. In English, the term "rally" refers to meeting again. In 1911, the first Monte Carlo Rally was the first race held of this kind. Unlike races where cars are only gauged by their speed on a circuit, rallies incorporate mass-produced vehicles... on public thoroughfares with a restricted maximum average speed. Officials score each vehicle based on the elapsed time and the condition of the car... to determine the winner. Car #90 Starts He's late! #25 is coming! Jack it up higher! At that time, the service team had left Eto in Busia near the Ugandan border, and departed for the next service point. The team led by Eto stood by for Godai's car, which had taken off fairly late in the race. They accordingly had to wait for an hour and a half for him to pass. At Control Point #2, from Lake Elementaita to Control Point #4, the distance to Kiptekat is 197.8km. The allowed time is 1:40, at an average speed of 91kph. That is to say that in a straight line, the service team had to travel at over 120kph. For each minute they are late, a point is deducted. However, the road was generally flat, and dry runs indicated that the course would present no problems. - Godai, how are you for time? - 4 minutes. - How is everything? - The car's fine. - Take a look at the carburetor and the rear brakes. - OK! - How are the other teams? - Great. Walton's, and Saunders's cars were all fine, and they tore out to the Rwenzori Mountains The race has just started. This is not good. We'll have you ready in a jiffy. How's the carburetor? OK! Juma! Hurry! OK! Good luck! Tell me, Yuko, why did you come? Do you hope... to rekindle lost love? Pierre told me that once, when he was practicing, a stag jumped straight into the path of the car. The next thing he knew, the beautiful animal... was dead in the road, covered in its own blood. How beautiful. Ever since then, he gets frightened sometimes. Get it off! Fort Portal One of the men is checking, just wait a while. Hello, APA Hotel? Room #222. Mr. Nomura, please. Hello, Mr. Nomura? This is Nishijima at Fort Portal. Mr. Simonyan in Car #4 hasn't arrived yet. Do you have any information about him? What?! Fog and dust?! OK, OK, I got it. Change the windshield first! Have you got any water? He's coming! - How's she running? - Check the underbody. Godai, good work. You're lagging Car #4 by 33 minutes. #19 by 23 minutes, and #3 by 20 minutes. The oil's fine! From Mbarara, they had come to Fort Portal via Kabale on the treacherous Rwenzori Mountain route. Car #2, Car #1, Car #4, Car #19, and Pierre's Car #3, formed the top group in a dead heat. Godai's Car #90 had passed 40 other cars... to squeeze into the top 30, so he was starting to catch people's attention. Most cars that arrived at Fort Portal had already had over 100 points deducted. This is the equivalent of a penalty of around two hours. Only 6 cars had kept their point deductions in double digits. Of these, two2 were Nissan's: Simonyan's Car #4 and Godai's Car #90. 23 cars had already been bogged down on the difficult road... to Rwenzori Mountains and been pulled out of the race. Kabale Good work! Thanks, Juma. So far, the cars that have passed here... are #2 at the lead, followed by #1, and #4, which is Nissan's, and #25 in 8th place, then you guys. Both of our cars are in the game. If we play our cards right, we could still win. I can't believe you've passed so many other cars. You've made this place a zoo. All of the cars are just jammed in the checkpoint. Relay point, Kampala Park over there. Let's go! Thanks. Come home safe. Nairobi Rally Headquarters Who's immediately behind us? Godai? Hairpin bend! - Madam, Paris is on the line. - Thank you. Jacques, it's Yuko. Yes... Jacques... You were kind. Yes... He's running in the race. No... I don't know, but, but…. But... Yes. Thank you, Jacques. Goodbye. Tire! How is she? Great! We're going to raise the maximum to 7,000rpm. Check it! #4 has a bent lower arm and timed out. It's set for 7,000rpm, so try to overtake him. The team is behind the UAC by 10 points. Eto, don't rush. Jack down! Drivers ready! Go! Eto Group, relocate. I think something is wrong with the stabilizer. How far is it to the next checkpoint? Eto should already be there. Let's go! We'll have to lift up the car! - What is it? - We need a stabilizer bracket. Right, we'll take the one off our car. Rasheed, jack it up. Shake a leg! Godai, you're 20 minutes behind the lead car. You can make it! OK, Rasheed. Good luck! Back to Nairobi. Where is Car #3? Car #3 Pierre Leduc, and Car #90 Takayuki Godai are neck and neck. The Datsun and UAC teams are really in a duel. It may come down to how each car does on points. Oil pressure! I have an urgent bulletin: Pierre Leduc in Car #3 of the UAC had a breakdown... after running into an antelope on the course. It will have to retire, leaving in the lead car #90. You did it! Godai, you did it! Thank you! You have all but assured victory for the team. Go on, get out of the car. You have my sincerest gratitude. Your success was amazing. I look forward to hearing all about it when you return to Japan. Actually, I'm going on a trip. - A trip? - Yes. When are you coming back to Japan? I couldn't say. Well then, best wishes. You too. Goodbye. In the 17th Annual East African Safari Rally, 21 out of 95 cars broke down before completing the race Translated by Scannon Timing by lordretsudo
