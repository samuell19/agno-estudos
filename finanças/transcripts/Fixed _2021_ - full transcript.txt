Well, I can- - No, no, no, no. - You leave him. - Hey, Mark! - I wanna sort this one out. - Marky baby! I'm not letting that fucker ruin Mark getting our pie. Mark! Honestly, I don't know what the fuck this is about. Shut the fuck up, man. Oh, mate. Come on. You know I wouldn't do this. Oh, come on. - Come on, Mark. - I'll have that. I haven't got anything. No. No! You ain't gonna sweet talk your way out of this one. Sweet talking? Have you seen Stevie Saunders fight? He couldn't knock out a wank. We're gonna turn over every place you've ever called home or dropped your scrawny little ass in. I don't give a fuck who I have to damage to get Al's cash back. Come on. I've got business to do tonight. I've got places to be, mate. I'll be having this. No. Mark! Mark, honestly. There's been a mistake. Come on. Marky baby, let's talk about this man-o to man-o.

Where do you think I am? Where are you? Still at the fight, babe. It's brutally beautiful scenes. It's like the rumble in the fucking jungle all over again. Whatever. That's why I called, Bon. It looks like this is gonna be a long one. Take Mike Tyson on 'roids to knock this one out. The plane leaves in two hours. Yeah. I won't be that long. How many have you had? Yeah, Al said I won't be that long. Please tell me you've got your money and your passports? Yeah. Just gotta pop by the lockup before I leave. How are you gonna get in there, Darren? You left your keys at home again. Oh, it's fine. It's fine. I've got a spare. Did you say goodbye to Jimmy? No. Fuck sake, Daz. The plan was to meet up after the fight. I've been calling him. If I wasn't so excited, I'd wanna kill you. It's a new start Bon. Andy says there's a restaurant next to the bar that sells live lobsters. You pick the one you want and they cook it for you, fresh from the tank. Now, I may stink of fish and chips, Bons, to be fair. He said he'll show you around he bar when you get there. Show you the ropes. It's nice and quiet. Old fellows with nothing else to do but sip beer and bet on the horses. Text your brother and tell him to get the beers on ice. He can leave the lobster. How long you gonna be then? Hey, Bon. Get a couple of coffees in. And a Twix? Of course a fucking Twix. We can share it, 'cause I'm watching my figure. Well, I'm glad someone is. I love you. Say that again. You. No, I'll see you there. I heard you. You must've misheard. You've got an hour before the gates close. Stop worrying. Get me that Twix. Chops. Well, there's a voice from a dim and distant. Daz, what do I owe the pleasure? I need a favor, mate. Well, your timing's a bit off, son. I'm just getting a curry for me and Jules. It won't take long. Go on then. I need picking up from Donna's warehouse. I've just done a fight. That's it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you might need to put your powers of persuasion to use. Oh, fucking hell. It's nothing you can't handle, Chops. You know I'm gonna need compensation, right? Yeah. Yeah, no problem. It's been a good night. It's been a great night. Give me 10. 10 grand? No, fucking 10 minutes, you Muppet. Hello love. You all right? Yeah, I'm all right. Fucking idiots to deal with again. Right, right. Look. Let me call you back. Let me deal with this shit first Hey, Luce. Oh, thank God. I'm just checking that you're okay. Yeah. Why? You missed your appointment today. Yeah. Oh, sorry, Luce. Yeah. I've been busy, you know, looking for work. I wouldn't normally call this time of day, but I was worried about you. This is the second session you've missed this week. Yeah, it's not a problem because I haven't touched a drop for months now. That's great, Darren, But it can be a long road to recovery. Sorry. Going through a tunnel. Chopper! Chopper! Chopper. Mark. What are you doing here? Here for my boy. You ain't taking no one. I'm here for Daz. I'm taking him home, mate. You're not taking anyone, mate. Chops! Oh yeah? You and who's fucking army?

Hey, Jules. Have you seen Chops? He said he was having a quick pint with you. We've already got our curry. He's just this minute left, Jules. Fuck. I've been waiting 10 minutes for you. That's the longest I've ever waited for anyone. I suggest you get here now.. We both know what happens if I have to pay anyone a visit. Don't you, Daz? Oh, come on. Okay. That's it. Piss off. You robbing bastard, and in my fucking warehouse. I'm gonna rip your throat out. Oh, Ken. Leave it. They've set me up. Get out here and pay up now! Ken, it was a legitimate mistake. I didn't know he was a pro. Yes, you did, you cunting, fucking liar. Oh, fuck off! Leave him. Leave him alone. You little rat face! Calm down! Calm down! He owes me fucking money.

I'll go for a piss and not have to catch his fucking shit. Hey, Jim. It's your dad. Call me back now. It's important. Right. Yo, Emon. What's up, bro? Fucking hell, Daz. What time d'you call this? Time is but an abstract concept, my friend. Am I right? No. The answer's no, Daz. Come on, Em. You don't know what I'm gonna say. Don't you remember anything? What do you mean? That piece of shit car you sold me. You mean the Audi? Well, that's a beautiful piece of German engineering, Em. The floor was so rusty a huge chunk of it fell out from under the missus' feet along to the M6. It's still in the bastard lake under spaghetti junction. Buddy. I mean really, if I knew- - What, you calling about my refund? No, no, no. What I wanted to talk about was- Oh, fuck you. Oh, fuck. Hey, mate. It's your lucky day. Piss off, Daz. I'm not lending you anymore money. But you... Oh, shit. All right. Come on. Marv. Marv, Marv. Marv, you beautiful human being. Shit. Right, come on. Come on, Saul. Bloody pick up. Bloody pick up.

What happened to good old fashioned manners? That's what's wrong with the world. Fuck. He's in prison. She wants me dead in a ditch. I owe him 200 quid, and he's a psychopath. Jesus. Ravi. Fucking hell. Cheat me once. He's gonna not cheat me again. Give me my fucking money now! Fuck you. Here goes nothing. Rav? Ravi. Huh? You need to turn it down a bit. What? The music, it's a bit loud. Sorry, mate. I can't hear you. The music's too loud in here. Give me a minute. Let me turn this down. Yo, DC. What's happening, bruv? Rav, where are you? You asking where I am? as in life? My soul here is on this spiritual journey. Why are you asking where am I, 'cause I'm at home. Did you hear any noises at my place, next door? Any glass smashed or bangs or crashes? No, nothing. Nope, nada, zilch. Are you baked? Like a fucking fruitcake, bro. Hey, why is it so dark? Where are you? I need a favor, Rav. Rav? Look, you know I fixed you up with that scooter, right? Yeah, 500 they wanted. Yeah, and the one I got you? 150, bruv. See? You know me, yeah? I'm like the Harrod's to the Cavalier Pub. But you know, I'm loads cheaper and I've got better customer service. You know, bear man slag you off. I've always got your back. Yeah. Cheers, Rav. They say you're a waste, man. Well, yeah. Anyway. They say you'd even sell your mother for a profit. Fucking hell. All right, Rav. Temper. So, you know, I did you a pretty big favor there. Yeah? Yeah, I suppose you did. I need you to repay that favor. Bro, anything, anytime, anywhere. You name it, I'm there. All I need you to do is go and pick something up for me. Now? Aw, bruv. Not now, mate. It's late, I'm in my boxers, I'm getting high. 100 quid. 100 quid. I'm listening. Mate, I need you to go and get me some cash and my passport. I'm on lockup in the back of the flats.

I need a shit. No. Mark, I need a shit now, mate. Hold it in. I've gone past the point of no return. I'm gonna... It's not gonna be pleasant in here in a minute's time. I'm not kidding. I'm gonna fucking shit my pants and you're gonna have to drag me out of here covered in shit. Say goodbye to the ladies, Marky. Fuck. Mate, I think it's breached. It's coming out sideways.

You get me? Look, you need the lockup number. Shit, man. Yeah. Lockup number. What is it? 27. 27. Okay. Hey, how am I gonna get in? Go around the back. It's the last but one garage. Last but one garage. All right. Got it. Okay. What's going on? I don't know. I can hear sirens and blue lights. Shit, your smoking is making you paranoid. No, no, fam. I ain't paranoid. I'm just cautious. I don't wanna get arrested, you get me? Okay. I'm here. All right. Good. Look around. See if there's anybody there. No. I don't see anyone. Hey, DC. I feel like a spy. Look under the brick in the corner. Okay. Okay. Under that bit of wood, there should be a key. Seriously, bruv. - In here? - Yeah. In there. Bruv, what if there's snakes and spiders? Look, we're in Birmingham, Rav. There's gonna be spiders, but I promise, it wouldn't bite you. Are you sure? 'Cause I saw this TV show, right, and this guy's hand got bit- - I can't believe I'm having this conversation. All right. Chill out, man. I'm doing you a favor here, you get me? Bruv, I don't like this. You got it? I feel something. The wood. Yeah, yeah. I got it. Huh? Should be a key under there. Yeah, yeah. I got it. There you go. A piece of piss, bruv. Now go and let yourself in. Be careful. You're the paranoid one, DC. Not me. You. Bruv, it won't turn. Wiggle it about a bit. Come on. Yeah, got it. Bring in the scooter and close the fucking shutter, bruv. okay, you need to go to the back of the garage. Find a chest of drawers. Okay. Bruv, it's bare dark in here, man. Fuck! Move that box. Bruv, I just hurt my knee. What is this anyway? Fucking paint. Rav, you need the last drawer down. Hang on, bruv. I'm just moving this box out of the way. Last drawer down. Fuck me. Don't be getting any ideas, Rav. How much you got in here, bruv? Enough. Now clear it out. Hey, DC. You gotta tell me. Where'd you get all this from? Back of a Polish lorry. Now, bag it up and get out of there. What the fuck was that? Ravi? Talk to me. Bruv? Bruv? Bruv, what do I do now? Just stay calm, Ravi boy. Stay calm. Stay calm? Stay calm? You know very well I pretend to be a road man. I have a degree from Warwick University for crying out loud. I can't fight these guys. They'll fucking kill me. They'll kill me. All right, fill the bag with cash, Shove it in the helmet box, and get the fuck out of there. This is big. This is big. You have fucked me over. Don't be negative, Rav. Yeah? Have faith in your uncle Daz. Fuck you. You ain't my uncle. Where's that come from? I think it's the opposite side. Okay. Now's the time. Oh, wait, wait. Hold up. Bruv, it's so dark in here, I can barely see anything. Go. - Wait. - What the fuck? Wait. I'm gonna put this on my bike so I can see where I'm going. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Get the shutter open, Rav. Yes, Rav. Fuck you. Fuck your moms. You know I'm at Ken Donna's warehouse. Of course he knows. no, no, no, no, no, no. Wrong way! Oh, come on, Rav. Watch out! You're losing them. Go on, Rav. Can you hear me, Rav? They're right behind me. Well, keep running. Go on, kid. Bruv, they're right behind me. The person you are trying to reach - is unavailable. - What the fuck? No. No. You prick of a door! Fuck. Focus on goodness. Charlotte! How you doing? Darren, how come you haven't been coming to the meetings? I'm done with it, Char. Not touched to drop for six months now. I've missed our chats. You're always so fucking optimistic. You got to be, haven't you? Char? You okay? Well, I've not been in the best frame of mind. Lucy said that we should chat if anything ever- Char, listen. It's not worth it. Put down the can. The what? I heard you opening a can, Charlotte. It's really best if you just put it down. That's easy for you to say. You seem to have just stopped. You got a job at the phone shop, didn't you? I was chucked out of my accomodation 'cause this girl was being a total bitch, saying that I nicked her food. And then, I asked my dad if I could come home until I could find a place, but he didn't wanna know. But you've still got your job, right? How did you just stop, Daz? How the fuck did you do it? 'Cause at the moment, I'm really struggling. Bonnie. It was my partner Bonnie. She gave me a load of self-help books. A lot of it's bullocks, really, but there's this one phrase, "Focus on the goodness," because if you focus on the goodness it grows inside of you or something. That's what I started to do, focusing on the good things, looking to the future. And then, things just started to get better. Well, I haven't got any good things to focus on, Darren. Not now. What? Come on. You're young, you got a job. You got plenty of time to turn things around. Look at me, eh? Who would've thought I'd be in the position I'm in now? It's so hard and you don't realize. Focus on the goodness, Char. Call Lucy. She'll look out for you. She looked out for me. Can't I just stay with you, just for tonight, Daz, until I can find some accommodation? I'm a bit tied up at the moment, Char. I'm sorry. Call Lucy. She'll do right by you. I know she will. She's been so lovely to me. Yeah. She's an angel. Call her. Okay. Where are you? What? Where are you, Char? I'm stood at a bus station in town. Okay, right. Look, I really got to go, but please, call Lucy Fuck. Fuck Hello? Deb? You okay? I'm waiting. What for? For the elaborate story to start. The what? You know. I was having a great week, Deb, but then would you believe that got huge gas bill? And I need a couple of hundred to pay it or they will definitely cut me off this time. Deb, listen. Because you'd pissed your money away and needed to get ahold of some of your pills. Now hold on, Deb. You drunk? - No. - Pills. You really know how to see the good in people, don't you, Deb? I need to speak to Jim. He's out. I don't know where he is. He's not answering my calls. Not nice when that happens, is it? People forgetting about you. I never forgot a birthday or Christmas. Just picking him up from school. I had a job on, Deb. Or from football or from his mate's or coming home for dinner because you were wrecked. Look, last time we spoke, you said he had uni or something. He's saying he won't go now. What? Reckons he can make more cash by doing what he's doing now. More than anything a sports science degree could give him. What's that then? Selling weed. Maybe if you spoke to more often, you'd known this. Last time I saw him, he said I was an embarrassment. So thought I was doing the right thing by not calling. Daz Clemance doing the right thing? I need to speak to him tonight. Why? What was that noise? Nothing. I'm going away. Prison? No. Me and Bonnie, we just need a new start. Running away again. Yeah. I know where to this time. Is there an open name for an illegal bookie with painkiller addiction? You fit the bill. I haven't drunk in six months. I'm focusing on the goodness in life now. I wanna show Jim. Focusing on the goodness in life? Bonnie got me a book of inspirational quotes to help me get better. It's a little harder than it sounds. You have changed. Is Jim in his flat? Why? I owe a bit of money. Okay. You haven't changed at all. And I suggest that you get out top. Fucking hell, Daz! Look. Just get him to call me, okay? I tell him. I'll tell him. Daz, fuck you. Fuck. Fuck off. Fuck. Thank god. Ravi? Ravi? What have they done to you? This is going to be quite sore tomorrow. Where are you? What happened? They caught me in a cemetery. They brought me to this underpass. Who did this? I told them the money wasn't for them. Was it Nial? They worked for Al. They took all of it. They took all the money I'm sorry, man. Tried to fight them off. There was 15 of them. Did a number on me, clearly. No, no, no. Don't be sorry, Rav. I'm the one that should be sorry. I should have never got you involved. They were doing you over man, telling lies about you. Hey. DC I was trying to help you. What was I thinking? What was I thinking? What did you say? Oh, don't... Don't worry. You get yourself to A&E, yeah? No, no, no, no, no. Bruv, this is nothing. Nothing that ice or weed won't sort out. You get me? I owe you big time, Rav. Let's make it 500. Yeah. Yeah. Of course, Rav. Bruv, Emon told me not to buy that scooter from you, but I still did. Not like this. No, no, no, no. Not like this. Balls. Fuck! Fucking hell, man! Fuck. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. No! What's this? What the fuck is happening? Yeah, he ain't gonna be a problem anymore Al. Right away. All right. Yeah. All right, I'm on my way. Come on. We're gonna be late. Do you wanna share this Twix, or should I just eat it myself? The plane goes in 20 minutes. Come on. Jim. Hey, son. Dad, what's going on? Jimmy boy. It's so good to hear your voice. Dad, what's happened? Why are you acting so fucking weird? Are you okay? Yeah. Are you in your flat? I heard that conversation with mom. You were there all along? Why didn't you answer? Because. Because what? 'Cause last time I saw you, you burst into my flat at two in the morning, you slept on the floor, and then asked for a tenner to get a taxi home the morning after. So do you remember that? I bet you don't even remember. You're right. I'm a fucking nightmare. Why'd you call back, then? Jim? I thought if you were calling me, there's gotta be something up. Go on, then. Tell me. What is it? Me and Bonnie are moving to Spain. I got a job in her brother's bar. I wanted to meet up and tell you face to face before I went. Jim, are you there? Yeah. So what'd you think about that? I think that's for the best. I just wanted to say- - You don't need to say. Yes, I do. I treated you badly. Sometimes I should have been there for you, and I wasn't. I know. When I fell... Hold on. Just hear me out. I know you've heard this before, but please, listen. If I'd fallen a fraction to the left or the right, I would have been paralyzed for life. But lucky old me, - I fell just the right way. - Right way, yeah. Dad, I've heard this all before. So when I got out and I was in that wheelchair, they gave me tablets. They said it'd be all right. And I asked the doctor, "When would the pain leave?" And he said because of the way the injury was, probably never would. Yeah, dad. I know. I used to be a man that could lay down half of a side a roof in a fucking morning. Go out, get pilled up, dance 'til the early hours, have an hours kip, and then I'd get up and do a full day's shift on a couple of bacon sandwiches and a coffee. And then in one fucking moment, I was a baby, a baby that couldn't even wipe his own ass. - Dad. - And I hated asking your mother. I thought, "Don't worry, Daz. "It will heal. "It will pass. "And you'll soon be back to work." And I was, but it was different. I was slow and I was in too much pain. - Yeah. - So I started taking more of these fucking tablets. I was taking more and more just to get up in the morning. I got angry. Yeah. I know. I remember 'cause I was there. So I quit. I tried to get another job, but it turns out I'm unqualified for anything but roofing. I needed to keep you in clothes, and your mother. So I did what I did to get by. It wasn't enough. Every night, I wish I'd died that day I fell. Would've righted a lot of problems, not just for me. Can you ever think about me? You know, me and mom, how we would have felt if you'd have died? Pain wants your attention, Jim. It's a big, ugly monster that just nags away at you every second of the day, 24/7. It eats you alive. It's impossible to ignore. Jim. Jim! What the fuck? What happened? I wanted to look at you, look in your eyes, make sure you're not lying. We had some good times, too. Do you remember your 10th birthday? Blackpool, yeah. Lost your shit on a roller coaster, screaming like a baby. I was screaming with sheer joy. And then you went to the beach and you fell off your lilo. Yeah. Thought I could swim. Could you fuck. I had to bring you back to shore on my back. So that's it? You're going to Spain, so you're saying sorry? Listen, Jim. Your mother says you could go to uni. Yeah. So why are you fucking about, selling weed? I wanna help. With what? I'm gonna help you pay for your course. How? You're broke. I've been saving up for the last few months. I've got a couple of grand I wanna give you before you go. So you're paying me off? Really? Not paying you off, but if it's what you need, then take it, Jim. Don't be like me, son. I don't wanna be like you. Right, dad. You need to tell me exactly what's going on now, okay? No bullshitting. I'm in a spot a trouble, Jim. I knew there was more to this. I took a book on a boxing match and they think I fixed the fight. You fixed the fight, didn't you? How'd you fucking fix the fight? You fixed the fight, and they've beaten you up. That's what's happened, isn't it? Dad, you never learn. Dad? It's not looking good, son. They've stabbed me and they've locked me in a broom cupboard. What the fuck? Dad, okay. Right, you need to clean it out. Get a bandage on it. Get to A&E. I don't think I've got the time, Jim. Where are you? I'm at Donna's warehouse on the Dudley Road. I'll get you. I don't think an Uber's gonna take me like this, son. Then I'll get Dean to pick us up. Look, you can't go to Spain tonight. There's no way. Bonnie's waiting for me at the airport. I've got a ticket. Well, you're gonna have to tell her the truth. I'm gonna bust this lock. Wait. What if you can't get in? I'll break the fucking window. How else? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Just hold on in there, dad, okay? I'm coming to get you. Yeah. I've just come to see an old friend. Where's he fucking gone? Mark, he's fucking gone! No, 'cause the door and the lock's been fucking bust. No, the other door's all right. Well, he couldn't have gone far, could he? I'm gonna check out the back, mate. Mark, there's gonna be actions 'cause of this. You sneaky bastard. Fuck! Come on then big man! Come on! Get off. Stealing off me when I was inside. Al, please. What d'you think you're doing eh? No. No. Where the fuck d'you think you're going? I'm gonna crush you like a fucking stone. Bullshit. You're the fucking bullshitter, Daz. Those last three matches, you used professionals and sold them off as amateurs. That doesn't mean they're gonna win. But they all came in against the odds. And where's all that money that you didn't care? How the fuck am I meant to make any money? You took everything off me that I've earned for the last two years. Ow, fuck. People like you without a pot to piss in. make the best employees 'cause you're desperate and you need me. And I need you. Not anymore. There's always gonna be another loser. There always is, and there always will be! You are done, son. Daz, where the fuck are you? Where's Jimmy? What have you done to him? As little damage as I could, considering the circumstances. This has nothing to do with him. If he's got your money, that money belongs to me. That makes it everything to do with him, Daz! Have you killed him? No. He's not dead, but he knows not to hang around with his loser dad again. I was gonna pay you, Nial, honestly. With what, huh? Jimmy's told me. You're stabbed up, stranded. A big chunk of wedge on you. I'm coming for you. I'm coming from my money. Show me that he's all right. Show me! I'm sorry son. I'm sorry. Oh, shit. Bonnie. Where are you? I'm so sorry, babe. I'm just getting my stuff together. Bon, where are you? I'm in the queue, waiting to board the plane, Daz. I need to get on the plane, Daz. I can't wait anymore. I thought we were going together. You're slurring your words, Darren. It's not like that, I promise. You know where I'll be. If you want to come see me, fine. You said we were gonna get married. That was three years ago, Daz. I was gonna propose when we got there. It was meant to be a surprise. I got a ring. Please, Bon. Three years, Daz. It's a long time waiting. And now you're telling me you've got a ring? Yeah. I'll be there. I promise I promise. Come on. We're gonna be late. I'm coming for my money. Fuck! Dad, I thought you said it wasn't that bad. Oh, fuck. Dad. Dad, come 'round. Come on, dad. I'm gonna get you out of here. I thought you were Nial. He got me as I was on the way to Dean's. Come on. Oh, fuck. I told him you were at the garages behind the flats. We haven't got much time before he starts asking questions. Come on. Dean's waiting for us. Thanks, Jim. Isn't that the tune you used to sing to me at bedtime? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I thought so. It's just around the corner.
