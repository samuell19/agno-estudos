She knows what it's like for you to be away. You've led explorations before. Not for this long. Six weeks at most. She's a resilient lady. But this isn't a supply transport. She'll be fine. Or a job to say lean and back. It's a two year... I know. I know how long. Just go. It's hard. I'll go. I'm just thinking about what to say. Say they're tripling your salary, which is how we can afford to treat her. To cure her. You okay? I'm fine. It's two years. I won't be here. I know, but when you get back, she will. Dad! I can't do it! You okay? Yeah, yeah. Are you sure? Dad, I just want you to help me with this. Here, take your dumb blow sword. Just easy, a little gentle. I think my thumbs are too small. Your thumbs are perfect, they're just blowing too hard. Here, watch me. Watch me. Why are you so good at everything? You make it look so easy. It is easy, you just have to know how to do it. Don't blow in, blow down. This is you. Wait, just blow a little gently. Okay. Don't get frustrated, try again. It's okay. I know. What do you know? I know that you're leaving. And I know that's because of me. No, it's not because of you, it's for you. So how long will you be gone this time? I don't know. I'm just trying to figure out how to do it.
