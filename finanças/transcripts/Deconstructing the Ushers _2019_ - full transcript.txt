I inherited it from my best friend. before he died in the war and told me t® keep it in my ass, "Because, of the doubt that it brings luck, You can only trust this doubt. This doubt will prevent anyone from doing something as disgusting as reaching into my ass to steal the watch" Oh precisely. Sorry Gramps. how long we've been working together? Huh Mr. Winocki? 3-4 months you don't pay me And that is not including your old debt Your business with these watches.. Does not work.. You have no future in that. Believe me.

What's the fun in that? f I make millions, after returned from the past. and no one knows I fucked him, Then it's not worth it. That's precisely the reason why Antoine Robbed my watch. Everything I approved him to do. like robbing and demolishing the store, wasn't fun. But the things I didn't approve he took. know who screwed me. I didn't understand anything. Deb, this is for you, don't it open now! Only when I am gone. Give the Watch to Tom Coolidge. You see, Benny has this law. The Middle Law. When you allowed to meet him only 2 times. At the begining. and the end of the job. When you deliver the money. If you come in the middle, You die. Sorry Deb. Give me ten. then leave. One request. That's all Do not be rude. \ Ask. But do it quickly Say good morning. And gohome. Enter, say good morning. I had a wonderful robbery-, ask for the watch. Get off the door. go home. Jurk off, and that's all you gonna do. Okay? That's all you gonna do. Mr. Winocki. Avihai, get rid of your smile! Where is the Money? You insist on dying Pops! Benny, they stole my watch! Your watches are here Mr. Winocki. I explained to you. your watches are a gesture to me. what don't you understand!? Tony! Tony stole my watch! You have to punish him! Tony is here, on the balcony. Come Mr.Winocki, let's go out to the balcony get some fresh air. maybe you'll think more rationally. You must punish him. I explained to him how precious is the Watch to me. What you mean. This Watch? You ready to die for This Watch? Yes! You know why I like to throw people off the balcony7 You stopped nodding huh? n for'throwing people off the balcony. I'll give you exactly a minute, to explain. why you must have this wateh. If after this minute you can't convince me. I'll throw you down. you've convinced me, then I'll throw Tony. But it's my watch.. If you insist. Your minute has started. Benny you are a great manager One's word is their word. We had a dea Tony broke it! He broke your word! Listen, my watch... brings to those who wear it. so much luck I made a lot of money in America. But then I decided to come here to Israe because, you know I'm a proud Jew. But here with all the J.ews. the golden calf, we're screwed. Here the effect is opposite. The watch brings bad luck. And so. in 10 seconds. he'll know how it feels to hang in the air.

They're awarding me a prize of 6.000 Shekels I wish to give it to Ariella for the Special burial. It's Benny he wants to talk to you. Yes. Benny this conversation is over! Bye! I'm going. Wait. I'm not saying it's a good idea. I am not with Benny. How can you! What! You gone mad! To give her a... forged Doctorate! He doesn't have the Special Seal of the University. Without it he can't forge it. She has 24 hours to live. Maybe it's not such a bad idea to give her a few moments of joy. Where is your license, I can't find it? I have 12 points already. What am I supposed to do without my license? Come on. Where is he? I only found Ariella's license... You're going 40 over the speed limit. Don’t you think you've crossed the line, ma'am? Sorry.

What! No1 no no! It seems like justice is blind. Wait a minute.. Maybe she got the doctorate, and not me? wish this was the case. It's just a mistake. Look, I know you were very stressed out about getting your doctorate, before you fly to the convention in London. I can't accept this. Okay, it's until we issue you a new one. What do you expect me to do now? You don't realize how much of a disaster this is! It's no disaster, you're over reacting dear. I wish to speak with the professor. It's not going to help. we can't provide a new Doctorate today. What do you expect me to do? I can't tell you what to do.. Use your imagination...
