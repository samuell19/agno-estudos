That brings us right up to the hour here in Pottsville, Idaho. The one and only spud capital of the entire universe, and this is sweet talkin' Gene talkin' sweet talk to ya. So don't nobody go away now. I mean it cause we gonna drop about 60 seconds of important news on ya before we get back to those good ole KITY country sounds. At the top of the news tonight, and this ain't gonna come as no surprise, the weather. Well, it looks like all them ole dark and loud storm clouds that's been giving us such fits around here the last couple of days, have finally started to subside. However, the State Weather Bureau in Boise advises us that the break in weather could be temporary, and there's another storm front could be sneaking up on us like a hungry hound dog on a T-bone steak. If so, we can expect to have one wet Easter Sunday tomorrow. So you folks get your fingers crossed and your waterproof Easter eggs handy. Not to worry cause KITY news is gonna break into our regular programming to report any further storm warnings from Boise. Also in Boise, the weather bureau... [jarring synthesizer music] - [Narrator] In the distance, the town of Pottsville, Idaho. A small town. Not much different from any other Main Street, USA. Strange and unexplained events are occurring. - [Gene] The hotline number to call is 829-H-E-L-P, HELP. Hey, hey, still with me out there? - [Narrator] Some people are missing. Among them, a little child. The ultimate terror has taken form, and Pottsville, Idaho will never be the same.

Who's car? - [Dudley] Hello, sir. No driver, no registration. Damn thing's totally stripped. [sighs] What a mess. - [Mort] Hell, looks like one of Decker's junkyard cars. - Yeah, well they definitely lost control. - Did you run a routine check on the ID number? - I couldn't find it. Now you're welcome to look for yourself. - [Police Dispatcher] Mort, we've got a confirmation. No driver, no registration, no license. Checking hospital for further information on possible injury accident. Recommend check out ID number on vehicle. Repeat, check ID number on vehicle. - [Mort] 10-4. I'm on route to city impound. - [Police Dispatcher] 10-4 unit two, missing person. APB mudslides on Route 16. Creek bank overflow causing extensive damage. Two people reported missing in Pottsville vicinity. - [Mort] Where the hell's the ID number? Damn, it's gonna be a long night. - [Man] Detective Lutz? - [Mort] Yeah. - We seem to have a problem with they way some of these accident reports have been filled out. - What happened, Dudley screw up the license plate numbers again? - [Man] Yeah, you got it. - [Mort] Shit, I'll take care of it. Be back in a minute.

One of the worst storms in 20 years and you bring in some poor Mexican for fishing without a license. - [Dudley] Park it there, Jose. [man speaks in foreign language] Yeah, well, sit on a chair, Jose. - [Newscaster] For non-commissioned funds to Glendale was unintentional and has now been paid if full. We have in our studios, Dr. Garson Jones, leading chemist and advisor to the state of Idaho on regional environmental safety. Dr. Jones, isn't the dumping of radioactive waste into the aquifer contaminating out drinking water? - Well, I'm a chemist and I've been testing water for the county for over ten years, and exactly what do you mean by contamination? Are you referring to ah, emissions of over five millirads per cubic centimeter? And can you specify what form of radiation you're referring to? You see there are many, many types of radiation. It's a very confusing subject to the layman. - Did you lose your handcuff keys again? - [Dudley] They're in here somewhere. - Who's your friend over here? - [Dudley] A guy in for possession. - Possession? How heavy? - [Dudley] These. And no fishing license. I'm gonna book him. - Not trout, again. Christ, Dudley. - Fourth bust today. [fish thud against head] [Mort and man laugh] Wipe that smirk off your face, pepper belly. - [Mort] Hey, lighten up. - Matter of fact, I have some water from the aquifer right here. I'm gonna pour it into a glass. There's no more radiation in this water than what accumulate naturally. As you see, I have no hesitation drinking this water. There's as much radiation from a TV set or a radio. - [Mort] Uh, what a phony. - As a matter of fact I have a Geiger counter right here. Put this over my watch. [Geiger counter buzzing] Over the water from the aquifer. As you can see, more radiation emanates from this wrist watch than from the water. Therefore, one must conclude that dumping nuclear waste into the aquifer does not and will not affect the water. - [Mort] Pretty soon we'll all be glowing in the dark. - [Bobby] Two please. - Six bucks.

It's 6 a.m. in the morning. We just received reports of three more people missing due to the storm bringing the total to five. There's some good news. Looks like we got us one beautiful Easter Sunday, folks. This is the break in the weather we've all been waiting for. And this old boy's gonna call it a night. Good morning to you and God bless.

[chuckles] Now children, the Easter Bunny has hidden Easter eggs for you to find all over the garden. [children cheering] Good, good, but, but now you must remember, whoever finds the big egg with the bunny on it, wins the special prize. - What special prize? - Okay? You'll find out, darling. Okay everybody, ready now. Start hunting. [children chattering and cheering] - [Child] I got blue. - [Child] I got yellow. - [Child] I got the green.

[church choir music] - [Mort] Mayor, look, it has nothing to do with the storm. I know I haven't got any solid evidence, but I do know what I saw. - [Gordon] I think you're jumping to conclusions. - [Mort] Whatever chased me wasn't my imagination. It's out there and it's up to us to find it. - [Gordon] The last thing I want is a panic. - [Mort] Come off it. I was attacked. Mayor, you know you're the only one who could authorize an investigation. - I'm shipping a 120,000 tons a day of the finest spuds in the country, and no wild jawing's gonna spoil it for me. You're always making trouble, Lutz. Last week you complained about the pickets, this week it's-- - [Mort] Mayor, I've kept my mouth shut every time. - [Garson] Morning. - [Gordon] Mort, this is Garson Jones. - Gordon, good to see you. - [Gordon] This is detective Mortimer Lutz. - The mayor here tells me you ran into some trouble? That's a hell of a note. What do you think was after you? - [Mort] I don't know, it chased me. I didn't get a good look. - I'd like to run some tests of my own as soon as possible. I brought my equipment with me. - [Gordon] Dr. Jones is an expert in this field. He's the state official who elected Pottsville for the most sophisticated dump site in the country. Now I don't want word one of this leaking out. I've got too much at stake so deny all rumors. Work with Garson. Now Garson, you've had special training in dealing with the press, use it. I want this thing figured out and stopped without a panic. - Will do. - Appreciate it. Mort, you get outta here and get yourself some rest before you start that investigation. I've got enough problems around here as it is. - [Mort] What could be more important than this? - The Sweeper Committee for stamping out smut. My wife happens to be the chairman. [marching band music] - Happy Easter, Mortimer. Isn't this terrific? Everyone's helping out. We're gonna sweep the smut right out of this town. - Mrs. Lane, I don't know if you know this, but this building is empty. - Yes, it is but we're pretty sure they're putting in one of those filthy massage parlors. Ethel and George who own the shoe repair shop next door saw them putting in one of those massage tables, so what would you think? - How do you know what a massage table looks like? Aren't you being a little stupid? - Oh, Mortimer, are you in favor of filth coming into Pottsville? - It's not a question of whether I'm for it or against it. What's scaring the shit outta me is what's going on. Has your husband told you what we found? - This is a kind of contamination we really have to worry about. It's everybody's responsibility to keep pornography out of this state. Satan must be stopped at every opportunity. I've gotta say it gives me pleasure to see someone who really cares. [marching band music] [hooves cluck on pavement] [patrons chattering and laughing] - [Laurie] Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm alright. How late do you work tonight? - I have a long shift, um. There only two of us here today. - What time do you finish? - 7:30, why? - Don't leave here alone tonight. I'll walk over here at 7:30 and pick you up, okay? I'm concerned about your safety. - My safety? - [Man] Hey, Laurie, pick up. - I'll explain it later. I'll be here at 7:30 to pick you up. I want you to wait.

Anything. - [Dudley] Will do. - [Police Dispatcher] Pottsville to unit four, what's your 20? - [Officer] Unit four to Pottsville. - Lane Road and Lincoln Road. - Open up. - [Officer] Everything seems to be quiet. - [Dudley] Need that license and registration right now. Plain to see this is a 35 miles zone. I clocked you at 48 for four blocks. - I had no idea. - [sighs] I really outta write you a ticket. We can fix that quicker than God makes poor folks. You know, 48 is awful fast to be driving around these country roads. You really oughta think about maybe holding it down a little bit. Mm, Ah. - Ah. [laughs] - So just get on outta here now and take care of yourself. Try to keep it 35. - Okay.

[monster growls] Why don't you call it a night, it's quieted down. - [Officer] Roger, PD, goodnight. - [Gene] There's growing concern over all the storm related disappearances. And now my good ole buddy, Officer Dudley Ford hasn't been seen since early this morning, but the mayor assures us that a full investigation is under way. And Dudley, I'm playing your favorite song. You give a listen and get your tail on home back to your mama, you hear me? [birds chirping] - Joe, what's your reading on argininosuccinate? - [Joe] 96 rads. - Well, I'll be darned. That's a little high. - [Patricia] Dr. Jones, could you tell me why the mayor asked you to come out here? - Well, he didn't, he didn't ask me. I'm, I'm here on a routine assignment. - Would that routine assignment have anything to do with the discovery last night of a substance which was tested this morning, and measured at more than 900 millirads of radiation? - Well, I really can't comment on that. - I understand that the only place such high levels could accumulate would be at the nuclear disposal dump outside of Pottsville. A facility which you have endorsed as perfectly safe. - Well yes, that site is safe. As a matter of fact, I think a lot more harm is done by irresponsible reporting than all the dumpsites across this country. Frankly, I'm sick and tired of ah, untrue and exaggerated stories for the sake of sensationalism. I can assure you that that site is perfectly safe. There's absolutely no danger there. As a matter of fact, I'm planning on camping out there tonight to, to run some routine tests. You're welcome to come out there if you'd like to, see me. - Well, I think we just might take you up on that. - [Garson] Joe, there's some, ah, some more stuff to be picked up. [crickets chirping] - [Virginia] Gordon, what are you doing in bed? Evelyn will be here in half an hour. - Who's coming? - I told you last week about the Easter recital we're having tonight. How could you forget? You always forget the things that mean the most to me. - I'm just not in the mood for your boring friends. - Well besides my boring friends, your exciting family is coming. So you had better get ready because you're the host, and I refuse to let you make a fool of me again. - I'm at the IP&E Nuclear Disposal Dump outside of Pottsville, and with me is Dr. Garson Jones, Ada County's Chemical Safety Engineer. Dr. Jones, what is it exactly that you're doing out here? - Well as you know part of the extensive safety program maintained by IP&E involves careful monitoring of all areas where, where radioactive material is placed. - [Patricia] Well, I see that, but it appears to me that you're actually camping out here. - Yes, well, since this facility is perfectly safe I, ah, I find it much more convenient to, ah, remain here during the, ah, the course of the testing activity. - [Patricia] Thank you, Dr. Jones. - [Garson] Thank you. - [Patricia] This is Patricia Sanders at the nuclear disposal dump. Ron, how's the weather picture? - [Ron] The low is moving our way from Winnemucca and should be clearing by tomorrow morning.

[gun thuds on chair] [ominous orchestral music] [sewer lid clanks] [dramatic orchestral music] - [yelps] God, Mort, are you crazy? You almost scared me to death. - Are you alright? Why the hell didn't you wait for me? - Well, I waited til 11:45. I, I thought you forgot me. - I didn't forget, I got hung up. Where's your car at - It's around the corner. Got scared waiting for you out there. - [Mort] I got here as fast as I could. [Laurie chuckles] The keys? [monster snarls] Look out. [car door bangs shut] [dramatic orchestral music] Which key is it? - I don't know, the one with the tape. - [Mort] C'mon. - [Laurie] There's a backdoor.

Lutz? - Where are the reinforcements? - I came alone and I'm not about to enfor... Who are you? - You didn't call? - Now where is this thing? - It's in the freezer. - Move. What kind of a nutcase are you? - It was in there. [telephone rings] - I'll get it. - I don't get it. You call and ask for everything but the National Guard. - It's for you Mayor Lane, it's your wife. What happened? - I don't know, it's not there. - That can't be. This is the only way out. - [Virginia] Gordon, why do you let those worms boss you around? You know I'm not feeling well, and just as Dorothy Otterson was about to start her music recital, I get a message from Lupeta that you have gone off to that disgusting diner. I had to apologize all over the place for you. It was humiliating. You leave and we got guests over. - It's alright, Virginia. I'll, I'll, I'll be right home. - [Virginia] Oh, well step on it. - But if this thing is actually killing people, then why is the mayor trying to keep it quiet? - Potatoes. - Potatoes? - Around here that means big money. - Lutz. Get out here. Now listen, one more screw up like this and you're fired. My time is too important to be wasted. I'm going home and I don't wanna be disturbed unless you have something more substantial than a puddle. - It couldn't have escaped. Laurie, we've just gotta get some answers. Let's go. Garson called me. We gotta meet him at the dump. Oh, my God, it's out here. - [Arnold] We've been coming down here every night now for two weeks. - Yeah, it's necessary. Pottsville's our town and nobody here wants this. A massage parlor? - [Arnold] And just imagine what they'll be massaging. [Willis laughs] Yeah, well it's, you know, it seems to me we should just eliminate the problem. - [Willis] What are you talking about, Arnold? - [Arnold] I'll tell you what I'm talking about. I think we should burn the place down. [ominous orchestral music] [garage door clanks open] - [John] Hey, it even smells like smut in here. - [Arnold] The first thing we have to do now is to find something that will burn. Willis? Willis, come, get in here, c'mon. Watch the door. [door clanks shut] [ominous orchestral music] You look for something in there. I'll look in here. I knew it. John John? Nevermind, John. Oh, boy. [monster roars] [John yelps] - Arn? We're gonna get arrested. [Willis screams] [Willis screams] [garage door clanks shut] - Willis? Willis? Willis? John? John? Willis? Cowards. Looks like we got stuck with a couple of chickens, Lord. [garage door clanks shut] [Arnold screams] [window smashes] [monster snarls] - Michael? Michael? Where are you? [thunder rumbling] Michael, where are you? [wind howls] Michael, come back right now. - [Gene] My, my, it's a quiet evening here in potato country. So quiet you can hear a mosquito singing the National Anthem. But hey, hey, hey Sweet Gene's gonna perk things up a little bit. Y'all grab your honey and get your money and start stompin' to the sounds of Miss Dolly Harris. - Ladies and gentlemen, please, we're ready to start now. Would you please find a seat.

[upbeat country music] - Who's that old lady? - [Officer] Oh, that's just Marge Smith. She's been kinda cooking on another planet since her little kid disappeared out at the disposal site. - But it's not safe out there. - [Officer] I wouldn't worry about her. She can take care of herself. - But. [sighs] Marge? - What do you want? Have you seen him? - It's late. It's time to go home. - I can't. I've, I've gotta keep on looking. - For what? [Marge groans] Marge? - [Marge] Thanks so much for walking me home. It's been so long since anyone took the trouble to see that I was safely home. - Don't go in there. Marge, what is that? Oh that's just some of Michael's. - [Laurie] Michael? Who is Michael? Marge? Marge? [clock ticking] - My baby. [ominous synthesizer music] My Michael. I knew it. - [Mort] So you think radiation could have caused this? - Well, the only explanation I have is it's some sort of genetic freak. A mutation in his chromosomes must have been severely damaged at conception. Continual exposure to high radiation levels has created something completely unfamiliar to us. - But why is it so intelligent? - It's conceivable it can use a higher percentage of its brain, and at the same time be completely psychotic.

The weather service reports that another storm is on its way. If you can believe that one. It's gonna reach Southern Idaho by late tomorrow. There's at least one bit of good news, though. State Investigator Carson Jones has assured our Mayor Gordon Lane, that his investigation at the IPE Disposal Site is complete, and he's found no basis whatsoever for concern over the IPE Facility. In Mr. Garson's own words, "the average kitchen "is more dangerous than the IPE Facility." Well, he must have been at my home for dinner. Hey, hey, hey, what do you say? Let's get back to those good ole' KITI country sounds. [atmospheric orchestral music] [dramatic orchestral music]
