[Loulou] I came to New York in 1974. I was invited to show my film at the Museum of Modern Art. I became fascinated by the city. And so I decided to look for a place to stay. This is how I began. Little did I know. - Hello. - I'm looking for the room. Sure, come in. Brigit? I seem to have a spot on my pants. - A spot? - Yes. Well, how can you still be making spots? I hate spots! It's almost out. Can you see it? - Yes, I can see it. - [Cat meows] - [She huffs] - It's so annoying. I just don't understand how you can still be this way. [Brigit huffs] [Knocking at door] Someone's at the door. And now there's somebody and they're going to see the spot. I think you can't see it any more. Okay. I can see it. - [Fanny exhales] - I'll pull this down. Hello. Yes, my name is Loulou, I'm a friend of Denise, and I'm here for the spare room. Yes, come in. I'm Fanny. Brigit? Will surprises never cease? Meet Loulou, a French film-maker. Well, how do you do, my dear? Hello. What a lovely place here. Oh, maybe she knows your cousin, Patricia. She's a model, not an actress. But you know how all those models are aspiring actresses. Loulou's here about the spare room. Oh, how perfectly marvellous. Come and have tea with us. We'll all get to know each other. [Loulou] Thank you. We'll be loft-mates. How fun. [Bird squawks] Oh, Arthur! Do shut your hole when company's coming. He'd be the scandal of the family if we didn't also have Patricia - to contend with. - [Bird squawks] - You have another parrot? - Not at all. There's a dark sheep in every family, I guess, isn't there? Patricia is ours. Oh, a smoker. Of course. I'll get an ashtray. We do not smoke. Patricia's father died of lung cancer. Oh, I see. Anyway, what type of movies do you do? Not those blue movies, I hope. Oh, no... [Fanny] Here we go. Thank you very much. What were you two talking about? Patricia's father? Oh, my, yes. And Patricia's mother was struck by a bus on St Patrick's Day. How ironic. It made a strong impression on Patricia. - As a matter of fact... - [She coughs] ..I tend to think that that bus was Patricia's Waterloo. And her mother's also, if you see what I mean. My theory is, that it unhinged her. She has a very big mouth, you know. [Brigit coughs] Is my cigarette bothering you? Not at all, not at all. Don't be ridiculous. - I've got asthma. - [She coughs] - Oh, would you look at that. - Sorry. I have to get the spot remover. - [Fanny] I'll get the dustpan. - I'm so sorry. [Brigit] They're all the same! [Fanny] Now, relax, Brigit. You know what the doctor told you. We just don't want dirt all over the place in case Patricia should drop in. She never does, though. You would think we were outcasts. And she wouldn't think of inviting us up to that Versaille on Park Avenue. Nothing doing. We're not good enough for the likes of Patricia, apparently. - Well, is the landlord here? - Yes. And you'd better stop dragging your heels about the room. You know, space in New York vanishes like that. Wait! That's Patricia. - [Sander buzzes] - [Loulou] Are you the landlord? - Are you the landlord? - What? - Are you the landlord? - [Sander shuts off] - [Loulou clears throat] - Are you the landlord? Oh, we don't like to use the word "landlord". Even though I do own the place, this is more like a...commune. Do you still have a room in that commune? Because Denise told me you had a room to rent. Well, it's not a room, exactly. - Can I see it? - Absolutely. See, plenty of room for the bed, maybe even a small dresser in the corner, if you're interested. Ah, there is a closet. Oh, I'm afraid you're too late. It's not available. Someone pays me to store their books in there. You're not serious? Well, you're a friend of Denise's and all that, but there are plenty of people that would jump at the opportunity to get this choice little area. But my bathroom in Paris is bigger than that. You can't live in a bathroom, can you, Loulou? This is Soho, the Big Apple. I hope you're not going to charge me too much money. - 300. - 300? Look, I think 300's a fair price. You don't need 300 for that piece of space. This is prime real estate. I mean... Don't play that with me. I know who you are. You're an artist, you're a nice guy who just wants to play tough but that doesn't work. Okay, she's a friend of yours, maybe, but... She's not a friend, she just arrived. She doesn't know anybody here, you know. And you're not going to charge $300 deposit for this...walk-in closet. - This is Soho. - You're not going to... Oh, no, no. Wait a minute, wait a minute. How much do you pay? This is different. I have a bigger space. [Fanny] Now, part of this shelf belongs to Brigit and me. We keep our meats and cheeses here. If you have something small, like a package of hamburger, not one of those jumbo sized ones, mind you, you can put it here, right alongside ours. I told you I had time to wait. If you have something larger like... milk or orange juice, we'd prefer you double up with Peter's groceries on the bottom shelf. I don't eat very much, you know. Not domestic, huh? Just like Patricia. Oh, hello, Nora. She never so much as peeled an onion. You haven't seen her? Are you sure? Well, I thought she came over quite often. That's why I'm phoning. Okay. That Nora woman says that Patricia hasn't showed up at the agency in several days. - Frankly, Fanny, I'm worried. - Call that boutique. - That Zanzibar boutique. - [Landlord hums melody] [He continues humming] - Okay, bye. - Have a good day. Uh, Miss Blanchard, why did you make this film, exactly? Well, I read an interview with Andy Warhol about his earlier avant garde film. I was impressed. - And I... - [She clears throat] ..saw an image and... and then many other image. It seems to me that this film occasions a kind of crisis in the codes that effectively de-narrativizes the images. There's a certain gap in the drive of the signifying chain that, metaphorically speaking, causes the engine that motors the narrative pleasure to stall and sputter and break down. How do you account for this? Did you look at the film while you were thinking of that question? I think what my colleague, Charles Demerol, is trying to express... is that he just wants to see a good movie. And instead, he feels antagonized. He feels persecuted. He feels annoyed. Well, your colleague with a name like a pill asked a very long and vague question I'm not able to answer to. I don't feel you are talking about what you see, really, but... Uh, if I could interrupt, I think that the film does raise a number of important feminist issues, but I'm not sure that it isn't yet another sadomasochistic male fantasy film, yet another representation of woman as object for the male gaze. I didn't have such idea while I was making the film. I don't believe that, but I do have a different question. Is she really urinating? Or did you have some sort of squirting device under her tights, some special effect? Well, she is, in fact...relieving herself. If you really want to know, she had to drink two gallons of tea in order to get such a release. Now, what does that mean? Are you trying to say that represents the frustration of women? [Loulou] But she's not frustrated. Miss Blanchard, you don't mean to stand there and tell us that the urination sequence is not a metaphor for the problem of a male-identified female. Now, clearly, she's wearing panties, some kind of undergarment, thus indicating... ..that she's trying to fit a male image of a woman. But I don't understand. Is it a man or a woman? [Taxi approaches] [Errol] Okay, what's next? It's a French film by some French film-maker, It's an art film. Weinblatt thought it might move some demographics of the 3AM art film slot. The 6PM audience sure as hell is not going to go for that. I think it sits basically right, Arnie. I think you might get a couple of pig farmers at 6am, but...PM? It's a whole 'nother ball game. So what do we do with it? That's 15,000 down the crapper. Look, here comes that French thing. [Projector whirs] [Sid] Oh, my God, I can't take this. I'll see you fellas tomorrow. It's too much for me. [Errol] A hundred and thirteen films today already, and it's going to go on and on and on. What's next? - You must be Loulou. - Yeah. Come on in. So, you make your movie. Yeah, I'm in the business. Actually, I don't think I was very specific on... what, you know, you're supposed to do on the phone. Mm... What do you mean? What...what kind of job is it, exactly? Well, it's not a movie job, per se, if you follow me. But it's definitely a film connected job. See, what I need is someone with a heavy French accent... ..to talk on the telephone. Ooh, it sounds like you've had a day. Do you like this wig? It's the new style. They're all wearing them. Although the acetate is just horrible on your skin. I couldn't believe it. My own government tried to set me up as a kind of a prostitute. Oh, well, I wish mine would. Those hookers in Washington make a fortune. I've got to get a Quaalude before we go on tonight. There's some blow in the bathroom. - [Fanny] In the toilet? - Yes. God, am I out of it. Where are you playing tonight? CBGB? Darling, when I've got this guitar I don't know where I am, let me tell you. Loulou, do you know some Sid? Some what? [Fanny] I think a guy named Sid called, had a kind of husky voice. Oh, yeah, I know. Yeah. [She clears throat] [Brigit continues playing guitar] [Guitar playing stops] [Melancholy orchestral music gradually increases in volume] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Music concludes] [Soft clatter] [Telephone rings] [Blender whirs, rattles] [Blender shuts off] [Phone continues ringing] [Car horns] [Projector whirs] [Man, on film] And they're really at it, writhing bodies, really... [Director] I just came by to give you... Do you mind? I don't like to be disturbed. I try to cut your film. I realise that. I want to give you a few guidelines. This film has got to sell. It's got to work like a well-oiled piece of machinery. You get what I mean? I mean, when people see this film in a theatre, I don't want one dry seat in the house. I want their pants standing at attention when they watch this thing. Well, we know what your intentions are. It's not such a big mystery. - Well, then how come... - [Loulou] Oh, la, la. Just hear me out. How come when the hero tells the man he loves, "I love you" in the Turkish bath, You caught the "I" out of "I love you". Can you answer me that? Do you think it makes any difference with that script? He will say, "Pass me the salt." I believe in this movie. It's sexy, its warm, it's got laughs. It's got tragedy, love and violence. - In a word... - [Loulou] Emotion. Exactly. That's what motion pictures are all about. Right. [Man, on film] ...The music, which was full blast, and he just sort of smiled, took off his clothes, walked over to them... - [Man] Loulou! - [Projector shuts off] Do you want anything from the deli? Well, I don't know. I was wondering if I could get a fresh salad around here. You know, like a plain vegetable salad. Not around here. One second. [Loulou] You mean you have only hamburger and Coca-Cola here? That's all I can drink? One second, I'm talking to a pretty woman. You know, we're not in France. We only get an hour for lunch here. Well, then, forget about it. [Man] Okay, so that's three Cokes, three deluxe hamburgers and four fries, double coleslaw, heavy on the mayo... [Projector whirs] [Man, on film] We were smoking this incredible grass. And... actually he was making love to Juan. [Projector shuts off] ...A chocolate Yoo-hoo. [Mechanical whiring] Yes, I'm Loulou. You called me? I didn't understand, I thought you didn't like my film. Okay, fine. Uh, where is it? Oh, I know where it is. Okay, in an hour. About an hour, I'll have time to get ready. [Sid] She's gonna feel... [Gary] You think she likes the offer? [Sid] I think she'd very much like the offer... Oh, here she is now. Hello, Loulou. So nice that you could join us. This is Gary. Gary, this is Loulou. - Hi, Gary. - Hi. Sit down and have dinner with us. Welcome to the Belgian Congo. So, this must be the place where the nouveau riche come for dinner. Please, I don't speak French. I mean, I could if I wanted to, but I just don't care to. I was astonished you called me. I thought you hated my film. My father adored your film. We didn't come to talk about your film tonight. I have something else on my mind I wanted to talk to you about. I want to talk about a project that Gary has been working on for two years, and I thought you might help me with it. - So... - [Waiter speaks French] Oui, oui. I want a steak, medium well, some pomme frites... and a salad. Nothing else, that's all. And I'd like Assiette de Crudités, and, uh... blanc de noir. [David] I was wondering if this was one of my father's schemes to get me interested in women. He always said he wanted to make a film of a play I wrote called Nights of Samantha, and he was always finding these women film-makers trying to get us to work closely together on the script. And that was okay, except that I worked closely with three of them now and the film never seemed to get made. I mean, it would be great if I was interested in women. but, uh...I'm basically gay. So, nothing ever happens. Oh, he's only kidding, joking. He's got something, this boy of mine. I don't know what it is, if it's anything. But I'm willing to put up money to find out. I thought you might direct it. Direct? - Right, Gary? - [Gary] Sure. - Couldn't she direct it well? - [Gary] Terrific. She's just what the doctor ordered. See that piece of land over there, the one we're passing right now. Ten years ago I had a deal on that. It was all set to go. I decided to wait over the weekend before I made a decision. Monday morning, I woke up and the Santucci brothers had bought the building right out from under me. You know the Santuccis? Those are the people... The mafia people that came and made a visit to us one night. Look, sweetheart. Let me explain something to you. In this life, right now, with inflation the way it is, you've got to get in on the ground floor or you're lost. I'm on the ground floor. [Sid] Well, get off of it, that's all. Don't worry. I'm not worried. It's all there is to it. Dad, I'm worried. [Sid] Worried? What are you worried about? A young man like you with your whole life ahead of you? My God. Look at Loulou. She's got it made. She's a big artist. What am I? What did I ever do? I don't have it made. I just got there. And besides, it's hard. You have to work really constantly. Look, in life, you've got to learn how to take it easy. Let things come naturally. Be patient. Let me take your coat. Have a seat. I'll put the music on and we'll be home. [Sedate classical music plays] This is Mahler's 4th, one of my favourites. You know, I used to collect everything that was ever recorded by Mahler when I was young. It was a passion for me. [Music continues] You know, I don't think Mario knows anything about the theatre. He knows about movies... ..because... ..the last big success he had was, what? La Dolce Vita, 1964. That was a long time ago. He doesn't know what's going on now. Theatre, he's never done anything. Not a thing. [David sniffs] - He's not too bright. - [David sniffs] [David slurs indistinctly] Loulou, you want to go to Crisco Disco? It's nice here, but I want to get out of here. You want to...you want to go? It'll be fun. I'll take... I'll see that she gets home, deary. I'll take her home. - Don't worry about it. - You don't want to go? No? Well, I'm going to go. - So... - [Sid] Take it easy, son. Um... Okay...okay. I'll leave you to it. Bye. Be good. [Indistinct conversation] I don't know what's happening. I don't know why I'm here, why I didn't go with Gary. I can't...I can't... I can't find anything to say to you. Too many sensations, too many emotions. - No, it's not that. - Too much going on at one time. New York is full of those kind of energies. [She inhales] But I don't know, I never been with an older man. I've never been with an older man, so I don't know. [She clears throat] I don't know why I'm here, but at the same time, I like you very much. Well, I don't know whether I'm an older man or not. I know a man that's... had a lot of things put on him. I lived 25 years with a woman that... ..really was in love with the idea of being in love. You ever run into women like that? I don't run into women. I like men. Do you ever run into men that are in love with the idea of being in love? - Sure. - Mm-hm. Tell me, what do you really... What do you really think about... about love? - About love? - Sure. That's supposed to have been created in France. You're supposed to be... the real experts in love. Well, love is when you share things. It's when you... feel comfortable with somebody. Now I feel comfortable. His bullshit is gone, thank God. You mean you're falling in love. [Chuckling] No...I'm not. [Water lapping, burbling] Where am I? What's going on? [Sid] Good morning! Did you sleep well? Oh, I sleep so well. [Sid] I know you did. - You slept like a little baby. - Mm. - Would you like some coffee? - Mm-hm. Sit down at the table and I'll make you some, bring it to you. [Boat creaks] [She exhales] [He exhales] Why don't you stay all day and we'll go through all the Mahler together? Without a job now, you know, now I have to go back. But you'll come back? Yes. Oh, that's nice, I'd like that. I have to make a living. - But I'll come back. - Good. [She chuckles softly] We'll go through all the Mahler together. [Sid] Don't forget. I'll try! If there is one thing that will make you more serious, you have to get him to invest in the relationship. What do you mean, "invest?" The moment they pour money into anything, they become fascinated with it. It's an investment. Take my advice, treat yourself like the stock exchange and he'll go bananas over you. [She laughs] You mean... ..invest like you invest in the stock exchange? Okay, well, I'll... I'll try to do it the next time I see him. Where were we? - Sensuality, love... - Romance, action. [Projector whirs] [Sprightly music] [Sid] Another one with fur? My God. Isn't it fabulous, the way that it's cut? What do you think? Of all the ones I've shown you, this one is the most becoming on her. You shouldn't turn this one down. It's beautiful, Loulou, really. Really, you should take it. I'm wondering how much that cost. You hardly have to ask. We're practically giving it away. $400. Well, there, you see. It's a giveaway. Let's take it. Take it. [Music continues] Ah! Now, there is a piece of clothing, aren't I right? - Oh, yes, it's gorgeous. - Yeah, go ahead. I warn you. That one, they don't give it away. - It's $700. - [Sid] What? Look, at Sak's Fifth Avenue, for material like this, by a name designer, you'd pay at least twice, if not three times the amount. It's like we're paying you to take it off our hands. Well, you know, it's like an investment. - Mm-hm. - Let's look at it this way. Do you think the Museum of Modern Art would accept it when you're finished? Well, you know, a good piece of clothing lasts longer. - Everybody knows that. - She's got a point there. I have this little beige jacket at home I've been wearing for 13 years. It's never given me any trouble. She's got a point. Let's take everything. Okay, here's my cheque-book. You fill it out and I'll sign it. [Loulou] Hmm. - He was a coureur. - He was a coureur? He was a skirt-chaser, you know. You stayed with him all that time? All that time? But, I had no choice but to stay. Ah, you look beautiful. - Thank you. - Absolutely beautiful. Just like these flowers. Well, I don't know what to say, about those...compliments. - Compliments? - Not so much. Why not? You deserve them. You inspire them. [Sid] Ah, with you, my love, I could ride this cable car all day. Look at that magnificent river. Come on, sweetheart. [Sid] Shall we walk straight home? [Loulou] Yes, come on. So, that's home! [Loulou] Six months later, things were not so good. ..Up all night, practicing my speech, getting ready for this conference. What kind of a night did you have, Loulou? Not so good, I must say. I dream about a meatball. Meatball? Would you like some coffee, sweetheart? Meatball? Tell me, what kind of a meatball. Well, no, I dream about a meatball all night. Then at the end of the dream, I realised that my meatball was... to symbolise all the desire I have for another man. Can you believe in that kind of situation? [She clears throat] Desire for another man? - Are you serious? - Yes. You mean you're...you're thinking of being unfaithful? Well, no. What do you mean? Unfaithful to what, our marriage? Certainly, to our marriage. - That's being unfaithful. - [Loulou] What do you mean? Well, it's easy for you to say that because you have a desire. You can always, you know, satisfy it by going down the street to pick up a girl and thats...the end of your desire. For me it's not easy. Wait a minute, sweetheart. Let me understand this. I really want to understand what what you're trying to tell me. Try to explain it to me. If it's not being unfaithful, what is it? Tell me what it is. Strictly a sexual desire? Well, it's...I... I'm not sure. I think it's a desire beyond necessity. Look, I'm happy. I have everything I want a roof for once. I have affection. - There's your coffee. - Yes. - You have affection, what else? - I have money. You know, and... beyond that, I want something else. I don't know what it is. And I think it's my desire for another man. That's how we concretize. Well, if that's the kind of desire you have and if that's all it takes, is somebody from the street to satisfy it, that's something that I... I think probably... - I would want you to have. - What? Are you really to do that for me? Certainly. I'd be glad to do that for you, sweetheart, but I'm in a hurry. I have a lot of things to do. You should dress up, by the way. [She clears throat] [Sid] Did you go to the laundry yesterday? Yes, I went to the laundry, I pick up your beige pants. [Sid] How about my jacket? Where's my jacket, in the closet? No, your jacket is right on the... on the holder, right there. [Sid] How about the photographs? Did you get them from the photographer? Yeah, I get the photograph. I get the dinner for tonight. [Sid] Oh, what are we going to have for dinner? Well, I don't know but... - Is it going to be a surprise? - Yes. I'm very much in a hurry, sweetheart. I've got to button my shirt. I think I'll have to even... put my tie on on the tram car because I just don't have the time. I'm late...and it looks like... we're really pressed for time. But, sweetheart... So you're really... you're really serious about it. Yes, totally. Absolutely. I'm very serious about it. Sweetheart, anything that I can do to bring you the desires... are my pleasure. I want a young Puerto Rican. - A young boy. - A young Puerto Rican? - Skinny. - Skinny. - And very gentle. - And very gentle. - And juicy, very juicy. - [They kiss] My love, just to bring and satisfy your desires is my greatest pleasure. - I'll see you, tout à l'heure. - A tout à l'heure. [Door closes] [Loulou exhales] [She exhales] [She sings softly in French] [Man, on TV] Mr Clean has captured the sun with a fresh, clean fragrance. [Woman, on TV] Mm, he's sunshine fresh! [Man] For a fragrance fresh as sunshine every time you clean. [Man 2, on TV] Mm, what a fresh smell. And look at that shine! [Man] Mr Clean has captured the sun to make everything you clean smell sunshine fresh! [Man 3, on TV] What are you staring at? [Girl, on TV] Ring around the collar. You've got ring around the collar! [Woman 2, on TV] Those dirty rings. I tried spray. I tried powder. Then I discovered Wisk. Wisk is strong enough to get a ring around the collar, and your whole wash-load clean. [Child, on TV] I see you cleaned up your act. No more... [In sing-song voice] Ring around the collar! [Woman 2] Wisk, strong enough to get ring around the collar, and your whole wash clean. And if you noticed a chill in the air, it's because fall is officially here. And Bob Harris will tell us what to expect for the week to come. For the complete report, Watch the 10 o'clock weekend news, tonight with Marvin Scott I'm Doris McMillan. Have a very special week ahead. You deserve it. [Bob Harris, on TV] This dreadful season is marked by the appearance and the vapours of infinitesimal microbes, which proliferate like cancer cells and give the air and unbreathable consistency. Fortunately, the primavera comes to an end more quickly than one would expect. Those little monsters, which are now totally invading the atmosphere, begin to withdraw to the bottom of the sea, where they conceal themselves and instantly begin to develop into the giant amphibians, resurfacing only when the mating process is ready to begin. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, during these crucial days, the beaches should be closed and the public advised against walking along the shores. Once the process is completed, yes, summer is then ready to begin. The beach is open again. Weather comes to the full bloom and the rocks scattered along the shores begin to accelerate in their de-calcification. [TV static, indistinct audio snippets] [TV buzzes] - [Jaunty music on TV] - * Let the sunshine in * Face it with a grin. [Woman 3, on TV] You know, life insurance isn't just for men. You have responsibilities, too. So you bought your life insurance at a savings bank. Smart. The SBLI specialist helped you choose a plan that was just right. You got a $30,000 SBLI policy for less than ten dollars a month. That's why they call it "Low Cost Savings Bank Life Insurance." Listen, just because you're good-looking doesn't mean you can't be smart, too. [Jingle on TV] * Leaves you more money for living. * [Car horns] Driver, I want to go to 77th and Broadway, please. [Indistinct intercom chatter] [Sid] Wow, what a day. [Intercom chatter continues] [Sid] And now for the night's fantasies. But where does one find a young lover off the street? [Sid] Maybe there is an answer. Let's let fate play a hand in this. Maybe there's a real answer inside. [Arcade-like beeping nearby] But where do I find this young lover for my wife? You'll find the man you're looking for on an organ keyboard. Okay. Okay. Yeah, stop. Thank you. Right here. [Organist plays lively music] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Music continues, Sid snores] [Music, snoring continue] [Music concludes] [Organist plays mellow music] [Music fades] What a day. Conferences... speeches... desire... noises... people. What a day. What a day. And I've got still to find a young lover for my wife. You must be out of your mind. Yeah. Out of my mind. But I know I made a promise. But where does one find a young lover off the street? Off the street? I've got just the thing for you. Jim? [She sings softly in French] [Singing continues] Loulou! [Sid] Oh, Loulou, there you are. Look what I brought you. [Loulou] What? Who is he? [Sid] Don't you remember, this is your dream. - Mine? - [Sid] Sit down, Jim. Don't you remember? - [Loulou] That dream! - [Sid] Sweetheart! You've forgotten already? [He inhales, exhales] Look... The night is here. Your desires have changed. But don't give up your dream. It's here. It's real. You can have it now. Take it. Enjoy it. Sweetheart, I'll call you in the morning. So, you're a painter. - Yes. - [She chuckles nervously] Hi. How are you tonight? I'm fine, I guess. Kind of warm today. [Sid] Yeah, I guess it is warm. How was your day? Well... I guess you might call it an interesting experience. I see. After you. [Sid gasps, yells] [Thud] [Tango music] - Don't be ridiculous. - [She coughs] I've got asthma. Will you look at that. [Music continues] We don't like to use the word "landlord". Even though I own the place, this is really sort of a commune. [Music continues] Well, I read an interview of Andy Warhol about his earlier avant garde film. [Music continues] We want to make bucks on this film. I got faith in this movie. [Music continues] Loulou, have you ever seen the Statue of Liberty? Let me show you freedom. [Music continues] You can't talk to me that way. That's really the limit! [Music continues] [Music concludes]
