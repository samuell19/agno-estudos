Do you also wanna see when he slits the hooker's throat again? No, it's late. Mum will get angry. Let's go. Put your coat on, it's cold outside. - Did you like it then? - It's well done. Well done? The story goes nowhere, but because of all the stabbings, groans and blood spurts ..people are scared and they enjoy it! If I'd manage the motorway system, I'd make people pay a ticket just to watch the accidents.. The queue would go from Milan to Rome! Do you know how much this bullshit usually grosses? ..just because of 4 people dying, with some tomato sauce...Millions! Think about it! And fool as we are, we're giving them the money! And we are ragged-arsed people! - Oh dear! - What? Is this the proper way to speak to a young boy? I speak however I please to my son! And I teach him to tell things straight! Damn! And to know life! Real life! With no lies, Snow White or Little Red Hood! In that way he'll toughen up and will survive, kicking people's ass just like everybody does! ..and will not end up old, lonely and demented, spending his afternoon in crap cinemas! The killer in the movie is the doctor with the beard! Take that! What the hell...old folks should be killed.. forget about the pension! We need gas chambers! Look,he put the car just in front of our one..just because he spent 15 millions, he thinks he can park everywhere..! I'll teach him a good lesson! Next time he'll learn! - Do you have to get out, sir? - Yes! - 300 lire.. - Move that thing! Yes, sir. Sir? Are you not paying, sir? Oh, no..I can't believe that! In those cases, I just can't help it.. Of course! Probably I thought of that.. I can prove that to you anytime! It's disgusting here..it's a pigsty. ..and she's just sitting there, talking with another man! Yeah..what? No, it's just my husband.. - No! Thank God it's your ex husband! - No, well..it's not necessary. - It's not important at all.. - Of course it's not important.. After all I'm just the moron who pays your telephone flirting! I'll call you back.. actually, let's make it tonight.. Yeah, at the usual place.. Bye bye. So Luca will be left home alone, just for a change, uh? Can't you just make it for one night without.... Valerio, keep your filthy mouth shout or I'll kick your head! Luca, go studying! Go.. Listen, Valerio. I tell you one last time. Stop your disgusting charades in front of Luca! How can you say that? Do you think he's deaf and dumb? Not noticing your smutty actions? Why don't you let him stay with you then? You wanna keep him with you? - I'll pack his suitcase, you'll be out in 5 minutes. - You know I can't do that! I work like crazy for crap wages. I can't take care of Luca! Oh yes, you could! You just don't want to! Because you're a selfish bastard! You are a coward, hypocritical and also a failure! That's what you are! "Anna, you're a cow and I decided to kill you". "Kill you". End of quotation marks. While saying this, Jack took the .45 caliber and sneered.. "sneered" with two e's, don't mistype it. Anna was shaking.. She shouted..and then quotation marks: "You loved me, you desired me, you had me" "How can you forget that.." Jack pulled the firing pin. Anna screamed desperately.. You wanker! Are you crashing against me? Delete from "you wanker" on.. Jack fired..bam! bam! Esclamation mark! Anna fell without a sound, comma. Her stomach was ripped open! End of the tenth chapter. 3 copies, double spaced, without the usual typos! Otherwise I'll change the typing agency! - Barigozzi, when will you give me that detective story? - Hi, it's almost ready. You've been telling me this for a month! I'll have to be at the printing office on Thursday! I'm always working on that.. even in my spare time! Even in my car! Try to come up with something that sells at least! Of course. It's the story of a fetishist who kills 2 lesbians and the policeman is a gay man who falls in love with the killer. - Do you have a title? - Yeah, well..what do you think of "fucking bastard"? It's not strong. Try to stick in some words like "rape" or "intercourse", or "unnatural". Alright, alright..oh, by the way.. would it be possible to have some more money this time? More than half of the wages go up in smoke for the printing.. Valerio, you know that wages are set by the director's office..! - Why don't you try and ask the boss? - Good day, sir. Good day, mister Mesca. - I'm using the stairs.. - Are you still in the news department? - No, I'm on a different one. - What do you do now? Stir people to pity! - What about this nice countess? - Are you in the mood for jokes? I'm sorry, isn't she the countess Esmeralda? Put this here and buzz away if you don't want to be in trouble! Hey, we have the countess and we have the marquis.. "The little mail of the heart" Listen to this.. Dear countess Esmeralda, I'm a 39 years old widow, with a son who's 18. I'm trying very hard to keep my boy away from women.. I'm really worried that he could end up with one of today's immoral girls who could corrupt him or even pass him some bad disease.. I understand, of course, that my son has his own needs.. So I decided to make a sacrifice for his own good..and one night I went into his room.. You understand? ..the thing has been going on for about 1 year.. and I was starting not to be worried anymore.. But he's been feeling very nervous and worried for some time.. ..and I don't understand why.. - Do you understand.. - What? - Nothing. I'll kill grandpa Gustavo tomorrow. The Monster. - So what? - Well, Livraghi, what if it's a serious thing? - Do you have any idea of how many grandfathers called Gustavo are around? - Do you ever watch tv? There's a program for kids, some sugary, corny thing that makes you throw up called "the fairy tales of Grandpa Gustavo" - What if it's that one? - Barigozzi, after 20 years of this job you're still after the big scoop, american-style? Let's think of serious things! There's still space for half a page.. take this and write something stunning! What's stunning about this? The only thing I see is Morandi having a stroll with his wife.. Don't you see that gorgeous girl on the side? - Yeah, but it's just someone who's walking on her own.. - Well.. You leave out the wife.. Bring in the girl.. You make a title like "Gianni, a marriage in crisis?" And you write 30 lines of insinuations, vague enough to avoid him suing us.. For God's sake, Barigozzi. You still have to learn the basics of journalism! Barigozzi... What? Barigozzi? Yeah.. Of course..that's every good citizen's duty Grandpa Gustavo.. - Of course, I'll write that down. - Do you have the Gualtieri's file? - It must be on my table. ..and it was signed "The Monster" ..alright, I got it. - What's going on? - Nothing important. Don't worry, mr. Barigozzi. I wrote everything. If you wanna pass, we can do it tomorrow. What do you mean it could be too late? Let's not exaggerate! - They robbed me! - It's the next door, you can't miss it..there's always a queue there Thanks. - I'm looking for Vittorio Santi, the one who makes "Grandpa Gustavo". - That door, he's recording now. Thank you. - I'm afraid, but you can't get in. Don't you see the red light? - I didn't notice it, I'm sorry. The Big Bad Wolf was hiding, still and quiet. And he thought "come here and I'll eat you!" The smart bunny saw him, but pretended not to have seen him.. The wolf jumped and bam! He fell in the trap, from which he could not escape. Laughs. Now my little friends, I have to go. Don't forget to behave and be good with your grandfathers. Bye bye everybody. From grandpa Gustavo. Claps. Bye! Stop! Go with the titles! - Everything alright? - Not at all! That asshole with the microphone kept on making shadows on my face with the microphone! - Did you see grandpa Gustavo. - Unfortunately I did. - I was looking for Vittorio Santi. - He went out from that door. - Thanks. - I'm sorry, did you see Vittorio Santi? The one who's making "Grandpa Gustavo". - No. - Excuse me. - He didn't come here. - Have you checked at the taylor? - No - He's probably there. Thanks. - Excuse me, is grandpa Gustavo at the taylor? - Try at the bar. - Here? - Yes. - Thanks. The smart bunny dug a big hole and covered it with flowers.. He waited and then the big bad wolf came and saw the bunny.. May I come in? The Big Bad Wolf was hiding, still and quiet. And he thought "come here and I'll eat you!" The smart bunny saw him, but pretended not to have seen him.. The wolf jumped and bam! He fell in the trap, from which he could not escape. Now my little friends, I have to go. Don't forget to behave and be good with your grandfathers. Bye bye everybody. From grandpa Gustavo. - Allright, Barigozzi! - What do you mean? They didn't find any blood on your clothes or shoes, so it wasn't you who smashed the head of that poor man.. Such a good news. Can I get dressed now? Oh, lazybones! They must have finished one hour ago! Mazza, try to get his clothes back! - Please sit down. - Thanks. Cigarette? - Can we talk about this weird letter? - Of course. This is not a very nice affair, my friend. You should have brought us the letter the moment you received it. - Yeah, but... - To be precise, you failed to report a crime.. - Barigozzi.. - I already told you 20 times! I phoned this morning! I spoke to someone who thought I was a mad man and I gave up..! Speak to your colleague and check..his name is.. ..Caminito. Caminito never received any phone call. - What? - Just like you never received this letter..or even seen it or heard about it. Oh, well..I got it. You don't want people to know that police could have avoided the murder, but didn't do it! This is a strong statement, I wouldn't repeat it in front of a witness, or even write it on a newspaper.. - This thing is not over! - I give you an advice... - Ahh! - There you go..be very careful where you step, Barigozzi. Bastards. Not only they hid the letter. But look at the state of my clothes! With all the chemicals that they used! After all, I discovered the murder! Give me 1 hour and I'll write a stunning article! The newspaper's competitors already wrote detailed articles. Your stunning article is already old, it stinks! - ..and he's asking for an hour! - Well, I have something exclusive..the letter. - Do you have a copy of that? - No. - Did you record the phone call you made to the police? Did you take a picture of the dead body? You! What's your name? - Barigozzi, sir. - Barigozzi. - Yes. You're not a professional journalist. You're just a crap eye-witness! That's true..well, I mean.. I have a witness: Livraghi. You've seen the letter! You've read it, we spoke about it! Valerio, I see what you mean.. but it's not nice to involve an old friend like me in this.. - What.. - In other words, you never seen this mysterious letter.. Well, sir..I still have the journalist instinct.. Alright..and I still have to learn the basics, isn't it? Don't rip the entertainment page.. I wanna go to the movies. Look here..damn crooks! Not even a word! Neither about me nor the letter. It's like the murder was discovered by the invisible man! You see what you get for being a good citizen? If I took advantage of this, my article would be on the first page! You would take advantage of your mother's death if you could! but being a crook is not enough, Valerio. You also have to be smart! - and you... - me what? - Dad, I'm ready. Good. Go. Come on. - If I just have another chance like this, you'll see. - Leave please! Go away! Leave! Strangle him! Strangle that asshole! Kill him! Kill that asshole! Bastard! Referee, you're a peasant! May you always dress in black! Mafia man! Look at Valli, for heaven's sake! He's crap throughout the season, and tonight he's saving everything! Kill him, smash his head! Kill him! Just like that..set that on fire! Thieves! Beat them up! Hit them! Amazing..my voice's gone.. - Do you have a mint candy? - No, dad. This time is Gigi Valli's turn. The Monster. Someone put this paper in my pocket. Didn't you see anything? - Did you see anyone? - What is it? Nothing, nothing..good news, Luca! "Gigi Valli's last hours! An exclusive photo shoot by Valerio Barigozzi!" Capital letters, bold, size 20! Go, go.."jaguar"..you don't know what will happen to you! Oh yeah..sign those..80 kilograms of muscles will turn to worms' food in a while.. After all, he will die at top of the fame..first-string player in the first division.. ..he would retire in a year or two anyway..and would spend the rest of his days bothering everyone at the bar with his memories.. He's too old for the national team! Come! Come! They killed Valli! Let's go! Move! Stand him up. There you go. - Come on, dad. You can't treat me like a child! - I have to, Giorgio! You keep on considering my newspapers like toys! No, I'd just like to make them more modern, more punchy. Get more readers, sell more copies! You still believe in Santa! Where is the secretary? Don't tell me that at your age you still believe that the aim of a newspaper is to sell copies, uh? - Finally! Thank you. - Well, I learnt that..I know how to build up a publishing empire like yours. A favour to a political party, to a politician or to a corporation... Yeah..and those 22 bilions..come in! ..the advertising is guaranteed by the state.. - Thanks, Franco, thanks a lot. - Of course..it's been like this for 30 years. - But things can change! What if they stop the funds? - If they stop them, there are unions, pushed by 2000 journalists and printers! Let's do it like in America, Canada or Australia, instead of increasing our debt! There are magazines and newspapers which are great business! Grossing billions! Well, I've seen them..they are crap! They just have stunning, bad quality news. They are not newspapers for me.. do you know what they are? - Kicks in the balls! - That's it, dad! What do you think readers want? - Not such vulgar stuff! Come on! - Vulgar stuff is what they want! Violent stuff, aggressive, neurotic, unscrupulous..just like the people who read them! - I... - Oh no! You again! How dare you coming in my room in this way? - I tried to stop him.. - It's terribly important and I have no time.. - You have no time as my empoyee: you are fired! - Let's at least see what Barigozzi has to say! - What is it? - This is the reception sir..there are policemen here, they are coming up! Now I really have no time! 8 floors, and the lifts are fast! Listen to me without interruption. The monster killed again.. big, sensational stuff.. a very important footballer. I witnessed the whole thing..I have the article, two colour films and the copy of the letter that the monster sent. - Everything is stashed in a safe place. And it's all yours. - Mine? - Yeah. But I want a contract as a special correspondent and I want no trouble with the police. - But I... - You have enough lawyers and politician friends to do that! I give you 2 hours, mr. Mesca. I'll sell everything to your competitors after that! - You were fast, chief! - As long as we have good citizens like you who phone to tell us about murders.. - It's a matter of duty. - What a shame you only called after the murder though! Well, I was so shocked about this letter that my first urge was to go and inform that poor guy. - but unfortunately I was late.. - what a tragic fate.. - How did you receive it this time? - This time? Hearing you, someone could think that it's not the first letter that I get from the monster.. Did someone see another letter maybe? Or read something about its existence on the newspapers? - Come with me, Barigozzi. - Together with the contract, send me some new clothes! An old chinese proverb says "if they trick you, you just smile and don't move". "because if you stress out, your enemy could enjoy it..". Any news? Nothing relevant. We got the forensic report. Same method of the first murder. The skull was smashed by many blows from a not identified metallic object.. It could be anything.. From an ice pick to a hammer. ..or even a medieval mace! The blows came from up to down.. ..and from the front. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Let me see.. The monster must be a pretty big guy. To be able to hit in the head someone like Valli, who is 180 centimetres,hell! Forensic experts also said that even in this case the red "V" on the face was made with a lipstick.. Same brand as before..it's called.. "Mystery". Some cheap stuff that you can buy everywhere.. Not bad..with the second murder we learnt that the killer is tall, he doesn't spend much on lipstick and he's a graphomaniac.. What do you want at this hour in the morning? Are you drunk? - What's that? - It's a present for you! - Did you finally find the money for the divorce? - That's a good one! Luca, come here! Come and see! Here. Look here, look at the name. This is me! Do you recognize me? You have to hang it here, instead of the sea..here we go. Then you have to light up a candle in front of it. And everytime you pass, you get down on your knees and you'll make the sign of the cross. and you'll make an act of penitence for each time you called me "failure". Until your liver explodes! - Luca get ready or you'll be late for school. - No, no school today. He's on holiday! He's going with his dad. As you wish.. Come, Luca. You'll see where we go! What a shame though.. I think he had natural science lecture today.. Maybe they would have talked about.. ..the vulture! You know, Luca. The vulture is a nasty animal. Disgusting and coward. Not brave enough to fight with other animals to get food.. so, it follows the strong animals.. and when they finish eating.. ..it takes their left overs! Come, Luca. Dad knows a funnier story. The one about the fox and the grape. Let's go. - Congratulations, Barigozzi! - Hi. Thank you! - Felicitations, Barigozzi! Felicitations! - Thank you, thank you. - You made it! Empty the drawers and bring all my stuff to my new office.. - Listen, Barigozzi.. - No, the toilet is busy now! - I wanted to say.. - Shhh..wait a second.. This must be Menegalli. He always bangs the seat before flushing.. - You see? Hello Menegalli! - Hi Barigozzi, congratulations! - Thanks, bye. You could blindfold me, I would still recognize Cometti's gastritis and Menabò's irritable bowel syndrome! Livraghi, you have no idea how much you can learn working next to the toilet Listen..you are right to be angry at me. I acted like a... - like a... - son of a bitch? faggot? wimp? Well, I'm not angry at you really.. to show you that, I can take you to work with me upstairs.. - Would you like that? - Yeah. I'll tell that to Giorgio, straight away. ..Mesca, the son of the owner. Giorgio, it's Valerio here.. I wanted to tell you...what? Of course, I'll be there in a minute. It's amazing, since yesterday they didn't even know who I was.. now I just leave for a second and they panic.. - What is this shit, Barigozzi! - Well, Giorgio..mr. Mesca.. It's the second article about the murder..for tomorrow's edition.. Well, I thought.. I thought it was a good one.. There's everything there.. the results of the first investigations..speculations.. - Tell me what you don't like and I'll rewrite it.. - Valerio, your article is nice, right and exhaustive. - Not a syntax mistake there.. - So? Tomorrow's competitor articles will all be nice, right and exhaustive! Why should people buy our newspaper instead of another? Let's be reasonable, Barigozzi. This story is important for both you and me. My father is letting me do this just because he's a son of a gun and money make him forget his beliefs! ..with the monster thing we doubled the circulation! Valerio, that circulation will have to become the standard, otherwise I'll be a spoiled child when I'm 50 or more, while you'll go back working next to a toilet! Giorgio..how can I do this? I can't find a murdered body every day! The murders today are of public domain.. all the newspapers are more or less telling the same news! I don't care about the news.. we have more! We have you! - Me? - Of course! You're the only one who had a connection with the monster..he wrote you! he could write you again..actually, you should push him to do it! you should become his confidant, his conscience, his only dealer! Listen Valerio..the day people hear the word "monster" and connects it to Barigozzi...that's it! Everything that other newspapers write would be second hand stuff.. Bloody hell, I got an amazing idea! Listen.. So..first page. To the center, in bold and in a box. Just like this. Let's see. The title on a single line, like this.. "Letter to the monster!" - Yeah, not bad. Carry on. - I write him! Informally. "Dear monster"... well, maybe without "dear".. "Here I have your letters, written by the same hands that butchered", bla, bla.. Good..a little bit melodramatic, but the idea of the letter is perfect. - We have to use it all the way.. he writes you and only you. - Alright..then I'll carry on with soppy, heartbreaking tones.. The poor victims, the terrible remorse.. "why don't you repent? Turn yourself in" Calm down..he might be touched by it. He would stop killing and then we're screwed! That's right. I'll carry on with an aggressive tone then.. A bit of human sympathy and that's it.. That's perfect! You have to tease him so that either he'll write you again or he'll kill someone else! I'll start writing straight away, now that I have the inspiration. You'll see! Wait a second. What if he'll get angry and kill me instead? "Letter to the monster". "Here I have your letters..." Well, when I read this letter on the newspaper, I made up my mind..I want to confess! It was me killing those people. I am the monster! Did you hear what I said? I am the monster! I am the monster! Alright...tell me, what weapon did you use? An axe. Make a sketch of the place where you killed Valli. Where you got in and hid. Well, I don't remember..I mean.. I was in a state of shock.. - I'm not sure.. - Yeah, right.. But I confessed! Isn't that enough? It's me! The killer, the monster! - You have to believe me, I'm the monster. I swear! - Yeah, yeah.. - This is ridiculous.. - Was that fruitful? The usual crazy man..damn Barigozzi and his letters! He roused all the mythomaniacs of the city! I had to rely on 3 men, just to answer the calls of all the people who claim to know everything about the monster! You see, we have to listen to everyone.. One of the calls could be the good one.. But we're wasting so much time..! Don't tell me. The police commissioner is on my back! I can't stand it anymore! I'm sorry..are you chief Pisani? - It's a very important matter.. - Listen, I'm sorry..I'm very busy. You don't understand..I am the mmm... The monster! I got it! Listen, my friend..there's an office there. Take a number and queue up.. Good! - Doesn't this black monster look good? - Yeah, yeah..it works. You know what we'll do for tomorrow's edition? We'll have the "V" printed in red! It's more sinister! Think about the costs just to have another colour! Yeah, but it's worth the effort! In 2 days, the newsstands increased the requests of 3 times! In these times of massacres, kidnappings, terrorist attacks some old-style murder like this one is seen as fresh air! - As long as it lasts! - I also like the idea of the letter which continues on the internal pages! That's right! So that even the people who only take a peep at the newspaper at the newsstand will read it! By the way, we have to strengthen the distribution or we'll have a problem. Vismara promised me that he'll give us 3 trucks full of southern unemployed peasants to distribute the newspaper in the centre. You are Valerio Barigozzi, aren't you? - What are you doing? Who are you? - Shut up. Nobody has to hear. Who are you? The lipstick "Mystery". Let me introduce myself.. I am Baruffi, from "Baruffi Cosmetics". Pleased to meet you. I'm not fucking pleased! Is this the way to approach someone? - Fuck you.. - No, listen! I wanted to talk to you about some business matter. - Are you interested? - It depends. - Well, listen..my company makes the "Mystery" lipstick.. - Do you know something about the cosmetics business? - No, I don't. Well, to make it short, it's a problematic thing..the americans are ruling the market.. I wasn't selling much, I was about to close down. Then the monster came, God bless him! Amongst many out there, he chose my lipstick to write on his victims! - Do you sell more now? - Sell more? Well, it just took a couple of lines on the newspaper and half of the italian women wanted to try the lipstick, to get the thrill of wearing "the monster lipstick"! That's why I had the idea to make a new line of products.. and call it "murder", or even "crime".. in english it might work even better. What do you say? - I say that I don't see the connection between me and your lipsticks! - Oh, come on Barigozzi! I thought you figured it out! Advertising is the soul of commerce! ..and we can say that you have the exclusive rights for the monster... Let's be straight..everytime you mention my lipstick in your articles I give you 500.000 lire, what do you say? - Who do you think I am? - Well, sorry I didn't mean to offend you.. Do you think I'm an amateur? Of course I get offended! I can do much more than mentioning your lipstick in the articles..for 2 millions there will be a picture of it! Together with its name! 10 millions and there will be a 3 column article with an interview, using the monster investigation as an excuse! Barigozzi! I knew you were my man! I also had another promotional idea.. Some plastic puppets for the shops.. The monster! With a killer face..! With the same look that he has when he jumps on his victims! - Even next time, all the post go through this office, right? - Yes, sir. Nothing. The son of a bitch is not writing anymore! - You can stop searching, there will be no letter from the monster - Does it say it there? I sent this letter. I put one hair of mine in it, and it's not here anymore. - What do you care? You have many of them. - Someone opened it and checked it! So if the monster writes, we'll never get the letter! - Who checked it? - Police of course, they're not stupid. Where are we? In Chile? This is violation of epistolary secret! I'll make a scandal! Leave it. We were fool not to think about it. Valerio, If we don't come up with something soon we're screwed! - Well, I.. - There's no point in discussing.. Let's be realistic. A week has passed since the last murder. The letter to the monster is not good anymore, considering he's not answering.. This morning sales dropped. Only a little, but it's a sign. We got all we could from this story.. the only thing that I can do is to start going around smashing heads myself.. Not a bad idea..anyway, remember that tomorrow my father will be back from that congress in Germany.. The first thing he'll do will be checking the circulation figures.. If he notices that they went down..well, you know what it will happen to you.. - Do you want a mint candy? - No, I'm checking if there's any mail. Nothing..he's not writing anymore, the bastard! Why? What have I done to him? To think that he's hiding somewhere in this bloody city...where? Damn..maybe he lives close to the victims.. Look, this is the tv studio, and this is the football pitch.. They're not that far apart.. Where in the world is he? And why these 2 places? Luca! Luca, I got it! I got it, look! - You see? Do you get it? - What's the matter with you, writing on the signposts? What do you think you're doing? A "V" sign! "V" like "victory", "V" like "Valerio tells you to fuck off!" "V" like "Valerio will show you who Barigozzi is!" "The city is menaced by a bloodstained and terrifying V" Madam, you have to understand that nothing is certain. It's just a journalist's hypothesis. There's no basis to say that.. Yeah, I know that this damn "V" is passing over your house, but it's also passing over 100.000 other people's houses! What do you mean "protect"? I can't watch over the whole city! Listen..do as you wish.. write whoever you want! Oh, how I wish they would transfer me! I don't want any more phone calls, right? I got more trouble from Barigozzi in 10 days than all that I had in 10 years! Yeah, but he could be right.. I mean, there's no connection between the victims.. The monster could even be a maniac killer who picks them up by randomly. ..and we have the "V" sign on the faces..well, maybe.. I go and check how it is going with the interrogations, see you later. I've told you, Barigozzi. Be careful where you step. - Are we going home? - No, straight to the office! Quick! - Alright. - Hey, Livraghi! - I'm sorry, I didn't see you. What's going on here? Where is the doorman? Where are the guards? They're helping out with the newspapers. We never had such a circulation! We're all helping! No, you're all crazy! This is pure madness! Total stupidity! ..to publish this, without any piece of evidence, with no facts supporting the argument! This could make us sell 1 million copies in a day, but also ruin our reputation forever! - Yes.. - Find my son! And that idiot Barigozzi! Send them to my office, now! Yes, ok. - May I come in? - Come in, Valerio. Welcome back, mr. Mesca! I'm sorry I'm late, but I was in the editing department.. I asked them to re-edit the article on the left side, in the second page. And... - Something wrong? - I'm afraid there is..my father has some bad news for you.. What is it? It's weird that nobody thought of that.. The "V" line is also passing over our offices.. You got it all right. - What are you doing? - I'm calling the police. Wait a second, put that down. Valerio, let's try not to do some stupid thing. If I could do something to bring my dad back to life I would.. but things are like this now.. we challenged the monster and he responded attacking us! Valerio, this is the most important case of the century! And it's all ours! Tomorrow the other newspapers might as well close down! We can't work on tomorrow's edition and then call the police! It would be a crime! - Yeah, I know that. - But on the other hand, if we call them now, they'll keep us all night and we're screwed anyway. We're up to our neck in this! They could even think that it was one of us! They can't keep us if we have a perfect alibi, don't you think? - How do we get that? - Valerio.. Me and you met 5 minutes ago at the entrance.. Came up with the lift together.. And together we discovered the body..simple and clear. But that's not true! We would be the only ones to know that. - You were here already when I got in.. - What the hell do you have in mind? Some confused ideas.. You can't expect much from some lame reporter.. Is the assistant director supposed to be brighter? Yeah, I think so..let's do this: you call the police, you sound shocked, you stutter, and try to gain some time. I'll be back in 10 minutes. I get the photographers, take some pictures and then hide the films. Then I start working on the new edition. I'll make it all sound dramatic, what do you think? Of course, the monster is our personal enemy now! Yeah, but we know no fear and we keep fighting! I'll also attack the police! Something strong like "instead of looking for the killer, they persecute the journalists, already upset for the loss of their dearest ones". - Do you like it? - Listen, I'll call as soon as you get to the press department. Don't forget to get the photographers! Don't worry. Oh, by the way.. My deepest condolences.. It's a good editing job. He doesn't look like a pig anymore. - He almost looks like a good person. - This picture has to become a sort of trademark.. It'll be printed in the daily press with a caption saying "dead while on duty". We'll also have to find some dramatic title. Some shit like "your murder won't be left unpunished!" - Well, let's hope it will be! - The day they'll catch the monster we'll really be mourning! We'll have to coordinate all the publications of the Mesca Group. I want to get to all the readers, from 5 to 90 years old! Alright? - Let me hear your ideas! Come on. - In the cartoons department, we thought of 2 new characters. This is "Viperix", the uncatchable killer. It's good for the 8 to 12 years old readers! For the grown ups, we thought of "Monstrella". More Sado Maso, porn orientated.. Very good. Carry on with that! Actually, don't forget to put some decals of the characters in the first issue.. ..so that people can stick them to the scooters and the cars and promote us for free..! - Let's hear the women's weekly magazine - Listen, Valerio..crime news won't fit between fashion and cooking.. You're an idiot! I'll tell you what women are interested in..more than fashion, cooking and the dick! Gossip! Santi was a faggot. Valli had troubles with underage girls.. - ..and Mesca... - Mesca was a saint! At least for us.. Here is the second thing: emotion! Mesca was a good husband, good father, a benefactor, a dog-lover, a flower grower and a missionary of the truth! Third thing: women like to be scared. Find a very good writer. You can buy him. Make him write some thriller/mystery thing.. "The faceless killer could be sitting next to you on the tram"..I want all the italian women to check under their bed before going to sleep! - What about the "Hello Kids" magazine? - I think we need a different approach with the youngsters.. - They're more sharp..maybe we need sociologists, psychoanalysts. - No, we have enough of them! They somehow like the monster! After all he killed 3 very rich persons.. 2 symbols of easy success, in sport and showbusiness.. ..and the other a symbol of the economic and political power, in other words the power of the system! Try to depict the monster like a protester, a terrorist. Like a solitary fighter. Alright, that's it folks. Do your best! My condolences. Condolences.. Condolences. Condolences.. - So, Giorgio..how was the funeral? - Not bad. No rain, and television was there, so we'll get some promotion from the news.. - Everything fine here? - We're doing great. I wanna show you an idea for tomorrow's first page. I was thinking of something different. Something respectable and very dramatic, like this.. A big white box..only the name of the 3 victims inside.. Vittorio Santi, Gigi Valli.. and Nicola Mesca. And underneath, something like "will this list get bigger?" Uh? Yeah, the idea is not bad, but..well..that Gigi is not making it sound dramatic.. Well, you're right..maybe.. What was Valli's real full name? I've got the folder here.. hang on a second.. Let's see, Egisto.. Well, with a name like this..here we go. - Damn! - What? V, E, N. Maybe it's just a coincidence, Giorgio..maybe it stands for "Venerdì" or "Venere"..but think of that red "V". That's the key! One murder after the other, the monster is writing the word "Vendetta"! The apartment that I got is up there. There's a great view, you'll see! - I knew I wasn't that handsome, but I didn't think it was so bad.. - I'm sorry. The newspaper just upset me..didn't you read it? What? "The monster will kill in this area. The victim will be someone whose name starts with D". Do you believe this? It's a bunch of lies, just to sell more copies! Oh well, they said it last time also.. this thing about the "V".. - That journalist..Varigotti.. - Barigozzi..I think.. - Well, anyway..he gets it right, you know? - Do you think so? - Oh yeah! - What's your worry? My worry? My name is Donatella Domenica Donati! And I live right where the circle is! I go and sleep at my auntie's, my friend! That's it.. I'm scared. Taxi! Taxi! That's why we haven't seen many people around tonight..are you scared too? - We'll give mum a call, otherwise she'll be worried. - Well, she won't be home. - Of course..is she going out every night? - Almost.. - ..and she's even staying out all night.. - Yeah.. - Go. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight. - By the way, sir, 2 people came...! Listen, dad. Now that you're rich.. can I come and stay with you? Well, Luca..I wouldn't say rich.. let's say that it's starting to get better.. But you see..there's one thing.. I haven't really settled down here yet.. this is a residence, a kind of hotel.. It's not a good place for a young boy. Don't give me that face! Of course I want you to come and stay with me! ..but we have to arrange the thing.. we'll have to find a girl who will take care of you.. Or maybe a nice servant from Friuli, with a pair of tits like this! giving you a different kind of lessons.. Don't blush. I started in a similar way. I know you're thinking of those things. There's nothing wrong with that! Take a look. It's so small! The two of us wouldn't even fit in here! In any case, I promise you that from tomorrow I'll start looking for an apartment, alright? Go to the other room, the light switch is behind the door. Turn on the tele, play a record, do everything you want. In the meantime I'll fix you a sandwich, do you want one? - Ahh! - Luca, what's going on? - Dad! - What's up? Calm down.. Who's there? Bloody hell, Barigozzi..I didn't know that the boy was here.. it was just a joke.. Luca, stop it! It was just a joke! Stop it! It's a rubber toy. Look. Here we go. I made 200 pieces, for advertising purposes. I just wanted to make a joke.. I'm sorry. Just shut up! You and your jokes! Baruffi..you're such an asshole! Luca, we know this good-looking lady, don't we? We saw her before! Of course you do! ..with all the money that the record executives are taking from me for the promotion...! Damn them! You see? I'm a fan of yours. I've got all your records! You don't have to suck up to me or anything..we're even.. I've got all your articles! That's true actually! While she worked in the ad for the lipstick, she kept on asking me "when will you let me know Barigozzi" all the time! - How come you're so interested? - Well, you're the expert about the monster.. My name is Dina..with a "D", and I live in the area of the murders.. - I didn't know that.. - Neither did I, until this morning! - I moved to my new flat today in the afternoon.. - Such a coincidence! That's true! - What's the name of the song then? - I told you he's clever, he got it right straight away! It's not just a song, it's the whole album! We have "The Ballad Of The Monster", "Shiver", "Shadow In The Doorway", "Kiss Me While You Kill Me".. There's so much bad taste in there! It makes you want to throw up! It should sell like crazy! ..and Barigozzi, who's the monster expert, should give you a help for the promotion, right? - Right.. - How much? - Well, I thought of a percentage out of the sales - as soon as we hit 80.000 copies. - No.. - I'd prefer a lump sum. - He's got a fee for the pictures, a fee for the articles..a fee for everything..just like the hookers! Oh, please..shut up..you have nothing to do with this! Listen, everything you say is fine..just make a deal with the record executives! Very good! It's a very effective promotional idea.. I'm not saying it's not..but... ..aren't you scared? The monster is not joking..what if he'll choose you as his next victim? - Your monster is not scaring me at all! - Really? - I've done a gig with thousands randy kids who tried to get my panties! So... - Well, in that case.. "The Ballad Of The Monster". F.K.S. Chorus only, first take. "Never believe my heart.." "Love is a game, you like it and you make it.." "Words carried by the wind, thrown away.." "Just like he's done with my life.." "I know what loneliness is.." "It's a great will to live" "to let yourself go, and to dream.." "my life doesn't finish with him.." - Great, fantastic! - The beginning is crap! - Well.. - It's that bloody B flat! I just can't get it right! - We can take the first verse from the fifth take, the rest was good. - Do you wanna hear it back? - No, you just carry on with that.. I go eating or I'll starve to death! - Are you sleeping there? Come on! - Me? Well, yeah, I'm coming, alright.. Watch out, here they come! Are you hungry? Hang on a sec. - What are you doing? Put that away! - Leave it! - Give me the camera! - Get off me! - Give me that camera! - Move away! - Are you crazy? - Give me that! Here, like that! Give me the camera, give me the film! - Stop it! Bloody hell. - Damn! Get off me. Get off me! - How was it? - It was good! There's no need to do it again, it seemed real. - Well, I guess it was! She gave me a kick in the balls! This... - No, I didn't! - Come on, maybe it was accidental! - No, she went for them! - Oh, come on! Come on, take this. You'll get 2 new balls together with your wages! Bye and thank you! See you. - See you! ..well, she got you, uh? - I was certainly feeling better before! - Not a bad idea, uh? - Oh yeah, these things are always effective! I'd say that you're doing a good job.. - What can I bring you? - I'll have fillet and salad. What about you? - Hamburger with mustard and a lot of onion, thanks. - You're welcome. Oh my, why are you looking at me like that? - Don't tell me that my nose fell off! - Your nose? Since I had my nose job done, I'm afraid that I'll find it out of place! Yeah, but if the nose is alright, why the hell are you staring me? Well, I was thinking that considering that everybody thinks that we are..kind of together - Are you worried for my reputation? - Well, on the contrary..I mean... Well, I think I could..we could.. well, you got it...uh? No..I'm not sure I understand you.. When you work, you do and say filthy things, and talk bad about money and all the rest.. but when it comes to say a simple little word like "fuck"..you hesitate. What does that mean? Is that a "no" ? It means that I never thought of you in a bed context.. Well, there you go.. Let me look at you.. - Come on, come on.. - Well.. - What is that? The waiting list? - No, I'm just seeing if I can find a spare gap in the evening.. - Oh well, a "spare gap".. - Oh, no..please! Don't say that stupid thing..I just mean if I have some time between my commitments! I work, you see? - Luigi? - Yeah? - Don't put onions in that hamburger! - Alright. You know, if there's one thing that turns me off, that is bad breath.. Well, you promised me that tonight we would go to the boxing match! You promised me that! Come on Luca, don't act like a kid now. Daddy is full of money now, we can go out whenever we want. I can't do it tonight, I just can't. Luca? - Luca are you there? - Yeah..alright dad. - Is mum at home? - No. - Damn.. - What's on the tele? - A documentary..about the flood in Pakistan.. Alright, you stay there and watch those dead poor people, while you are in a comfortable place and you don't give a damn because daddy takes care of you.. - I speak to you tomorrow. Bye - Alright, bye. - Does this lamp thing have to go on for long? - No. - When it's finished it will turn off automatically. - Oh yeah, I'll turn on instead.. Let me have some tan.. oh my, you look like a black woman! It's nice to make love with a black woman like you.. Look at that...the countess Esmeralda.. ..20 years of being kicked in the ass, eating out in a cafeteria.. saying "yes" to the boss and then, boom..in 10 days look at where "Barigozzi the failure" got..! - What are you talking about? - I'm saying that to be completely happy I would like Anna to be here..! Well, no! I might be narrow minded, but I don't like threesomes! - You didn't get it.. - I still have fun in the old way.. Folk style, andante con brio.. Watch out, it might be the monster.. Well, I'll have the chain on before opening and then I'll see who it is.. In any case my sleepers are big..I can hit him straight in the balls with them. In case it's him.. This singer's got nice lyrics.. Ahh! Who's there? Look who's here.. - What are you doing here? - Well, Barigozzi. I was about to ask you the same thing.. You have a heavy sleep, Barigozzi.. A woman was butchered, a neighbour passing by saw the body through the open door, she screamed, the police arrived...and you? - You sleep. - Well, maybe a have a heavy sleep, and maybe I am a little deaf.. but is that a crime? - Try to be reasonable, Pisani. - I've been reasonable for a long time, my dear Barigozzi. I am reasonable and I wait. And now I wanna see your position. With no blackmails or strong alibis involved.. Are you really thinking that I am... - That I am... - What I know for sure is that you are the managing director of a sort of corporation that earns billions selling murders! ..and if you're directly involved I'll force you to confess! You'll see, the "Monster Company" is now over! - It went bankrupt! - Well.. - Do you want to...to arrest me? - I want to kick your ass real good! - Anyway..technically speaking, you're under custody for investigation. - You won't even keep me for an hour! I'm a journalist and with 30 lines I'll ruin your career! I'll make you, the police commissioner, the prefect, the chief of police and the Minister of the Interior all lose your jobs! - Let's go Barigozzi. - by God, you'll have to take me force! 20 hours of interrogation! I can't stand it anymore! - What is this, the Gestapo? - Stop it, they want you at the parlor. There's a visit for you. Finally, it must be Giorgio with the lawyer..now you'll see.. I'll be out in 5 minutes! I'll show you what Barigozzi can do with a typewriter! You'll see what happens! It'll be more than dynamite! More than the atomic bomb! I really wanna see how... Try not to cry, for heaven's sake. If it wasn't for Luca who wanted to come, I definitely wouldn't have come here. What do you care if I rot in here? You wouldn't even care if I would have to spend my whole life in here.. - Even if I would die in here! - Dad, you're not serious, are you? They'll let you go, isn't it? - Yeah, calm down Luca! Christ, did you really have to bring him? - Dad, I don't like this place, it's ugly. The guards, the bars! - Luca.. - Dad, let's go! Please dad! - Calm down! Take him away. - Dad.. - Take him away! - Dad! - Take him away, you nasty bitch! My God..this is just what I needed to cheer me up.. Wait a second. There is more people. Thank God. Giorgio, you came. Now you'll take me out of here. I'll go crazy! Don't worry Valerio, try to calm down. - Of course, Barigozzi. Sit down. Don't worry. - Don't worry you say.. Try to go up and down between the isolation cell and the interrogation room for the whole night, lawyer! Well, for now we can't do anything. You are in custody. In 24 hours we'll know if you'll be arrested. - We'll know the charge against you, and then... - Charge? What are you saying? - I haven't done anything! - Come on, Valerio. Chief Pisani has a lot of elements that could be against you.. You are always at the crime scene! You have the letters of the monster! - You can profit from the whole thing! - Me? Only me? - Pisani even said that the famous "V" is for Valerio.. - Bastard.. We'll fight back, Giorgio! I've got a great idea. Listen.. - We'll release my letter to the monster - Oh, no.. Something different, Giorgio. Something touching, moving! "From his dark cell, Barigozzi sends a message.." Do you understand, Giorgio? Listen.. "Help, monster. Tell the truth! Write the police and save an innocent who was wrongly accused". You sell many copies and at the same time.. ..you get me out of here.. cos I...I can't make it in here, Giorgio No, it's not the right time. - People are a little bit puzzled.. what if... - What if the police say that I'm the monster? - Is this what you wanna say? Come on, say it! Is this it? - Oh come on, don't be stupid, you know I'm on your side, Valerio. You can count on me as if I was you brother! First of all, I managed to make them treat you in a special way.. You know how these things go. Even the jail is not too bad if you have money, don't you agree? ..and talking about money, you sign this for me.. You know, I decided to republish all your detective novels.. This time without your american pseudonym.. ..but in a deluxe edition, with your name and surname written big! You'll get 15%, it's not bad. Come on, sign. - What is this? - Well, I thought that considering that you'll be here with nothing to do.. You could write a memorial. Around 100 pages..the full story of the monster.. You sign the contract now and then we'll discuss the details.. I'm sorry Giorgio, I'm just confused.. What do I get from this? - It depends, either 20 or 100 millions. - Well, depends on what? 20 if you're an innocent being wrongly accused. 100 if you are the monster. I'll let you have the papers as soon as possible, so you can start working. Be quick, but write something nice. I know I can count on you. Mister. Mister Barigozzi. The coffee. It has been stirred. Do you need something from the shop? Cigarettes, cognac.. Do you want something in particular for dinner? You don't have to worry. Mister Mesca will take care of everything. He said "give mister Barigozzi all he wants". Within the limits of the regulations.. I don't know if it's possible, but mister Barigozzi would like to have mister Mesca here. Alone and with the closed door. Oh, by the way..they brought your papers. I put them here. I'm going then..in case you need something.. ..yeah, I'll ring... one time for the guard, two times for the commissioner, three times for the director. Isn't that right? Don't forget to close the door! Look at this..always tidy and precise, the son of a bitch.. He emptied all the closets.. he sent me all the papers.. What is this? This time is Gigi Valli's turn. The Monster. Nice one, my dear monster. You framed me.. There's nothing to say.. My God.. How can it be? Of course! Now it's clear. Now it's clear like the sun! Open up! I have to go out! Open up! - Open up! - Calm down. What's going on? Are you crazy? No, I suddenly became intelligent! I know everything now! I know who the monster is! Barigozzi, watch out. If this is a scam or a trick, I'll make you regret that you were born! - I told you I know it. I know it! - Why don't you explain then? Because you have to see it with your own eyes. You'll only believe me when you'll see it! - That's the door. - But that's your own house! Yeah, that's my house. Let's be quick. Anna? Luca? Luca? Chief, please take them off. Here it is! Luca.. The letter of the monster were written with that typewriter, that's for sure. - But what does this mean, Barigozzi? - How can you not understand? It's Anna, my wife! That's the monster! Yeah, I saw her leaving half an hour ago together with the kid. They left with the Cinquecento. What look did the lady have? Did she look nervous? She always looks nervous. I'm sorry, mister Valerio..you know that better than me.. Yeah, of course, of course.. I'm sorry, chief..don't you understand? Luca, poor boy, he must have found that nasty hammer.. ..and he figured it out..! And that's why she took him with her! - ..to kill him! - Ehh.. - What do you mean "ehh", she'll kill him! All the police cars know the plate of the Cinquecento, so we'll find them soon. And then I'm not really sure about the whole thing. Chief, I told you already. I understood the whole thing when I found an article of mine written 10 years ago with the same typewriter that was used for the letter of the monster! ..a typewriter I left at Anna's place when we broke up! I knew that that woman hated me, but not up to this point! This is a terrible revenge, don't you see? Thanks to the letters, she provided me with the case of the monster. ..an occasion I've been waiting for forever..she waited until I was successful, until I thought I had made it and then..zac! She frames me! So that I would end up in prison and she would just enjoy her life with my money! Because nothing could happen before Luca was 18.. Chief, they called us. They found the car. You see? - Is this the one? - Yeah..did you find it like this? Empty? - Yeah, there was no one here. Didn't you take a look around? Well, couldn't you... - Oh, stop it! You've been talking long enough.. Call about 20 men, let's set up a search - Yes sir. Wait.. Chief, this place.. I recognize this place.. Come with me! It must have been 10 or 12 years ago.. that's why I didn't recognize it at first.. We came here on a Sunday.. Luca was about 5 years old. It was just an ordinary day.. a nice day though.. It was maybe the only peaceful day of our shitty marriage.. It even seemed like we cared about eachother.. Luca was such a happy child..back then.. There they are! Luca! Anna, let him go! She'll kill him! Stop her! She'll kill him. Watch out! Luca! Luca, my son. It's over. Your dad is here now. Giorgio, maybe you didn't get.. I...hang on a second. Luca, please stop it darling. I can't hear what they're saying.. Thanks. Yeah.. No, Giorgio..you don't have to insist on the fact that I signed.. I signed either as an innocent or as the monster.. ..but instead, I am the husband of the monster! No way, Giorgio. The americans are offering me 250.000 dollars. Not counting the screen rights! ..for them I am negotiating.. What do you mean with "gratitude"? You're just trying to be smart.. Come here with a bigger cheque and then you'll see how much I love you! Alright, sue me then. That doesn't scare me. oh yeah...to you and your sister! My dear Luca..this is life! It's a jungle! Either you eat them or they'll eat you! Don't listen to anyone..just go straight to where you're going. And think only about yourself! And then..down! On the head of the people who block your way! Go and get dressed now. The porters will be here any minute. I'll take care of this. You'll see how nice the new house is! There are also 2 balconies! Dad..you had figured it out, am I right? They said that the monster was a tall person.. But all you had to do was saying "excuse me, can I have an autograph?" They would lower their heads in front of you... The first time I was afraid.. ..but it's possible to do it.. and also..you were helping me.. - What? - Of course, dad. The thing about the "V".. The letter "D"... Are you saying that I was making things up and you were... Luca.. You.. - You've done all this for me.. - You always said that you just needed a good occasion to be successful.. ..and then you would show everyone.. ..and then we would have the money.. to be together forever, you and me.. You said that people were mean.. - and that you had to kill them all, and.. - Alright, alright...I know.. I know what I was saying.. I kept throwing up poison for all my shitty life.. And this is what happened.. I made up a monster. Dad..why are you not looking at me? Dad..if you act like that you scare me.. You're the only good person that I know in the world.. Dad..you don't want them to lock me away in that place with bars and guards, right? No, no..for God's sake shut up.. When mum found the hammer said "I'd rather kill you than let them lock you away..". But when I saw the guards on the lawn, I understood that that was a lie.. You would't lie to me, right dad? I don't know. I don't know anything anymore.. - Dad - Yeah? Please..I have to go back to school tomorrow.. Can you sign the absence note for me? Yes, Luca. Yes my son. That's right That's right like this.. .
