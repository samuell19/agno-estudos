Why have I returned? After eight or nine years I've come back... to a place that no longer exists. I carry on doing things thoughtlessly... without thinking the consequences. As you used to do. The laws of genetics never fail, as Mom would say. When I told her I was coming, she looked at me... with a clinical eye, thinking I was sick. Her professional constraint, I suppose. But she didn't ask questions. She thought it was strange that I'd return tomorrow... not even staying overnight. She didn't understand, or maybe she understood everything... With Mom you never know. Why spend money staying at hotels? The bus arrives early in the morning and returns at 10 p.m I'll have twelve hours going back to Buenos Aires... to think, and nearly the whole day for pedaling around for a few kilometers... to find out why I have come here. I'm not a tourist landscapes mean very little to me... hardly any old acquaintances are left... and not a single friend lives here. Perhaps I've just come to have a chat... with you... to tell you about things I went through, and things I plan on doing. It's tough at my age, having to make so many decisions, and the last thing you want to do at this age is to make decisions. Don't worry, I didn't come here to find out about my father or to really know you, nor to expose your dark side. It's something different. You were always the crystal- clear kind, firm as a stonewall, but transparent. There were times when I didn't understand you. It wasn't your fault... nor mine. I was too small to understand certain things. When I started to understand them, I realized I was... no longer a child. Maybe I've returned to remember... every detail of that winter. I'd like to hear your story. I only know part of it. I played a part, I eavesdropped and peeped. Maybe I'm here because I realized old memories were fading away... and it's foolish to let this happen. Certain things simply can't be forgotten. They must not be forgotten, however painful. Let's go Dumas! Faster! Faster Dumas! Faster! Faster Dumas! Are you crazy? If you want to kill yourself, get somebody to kick your head. I'm training for Racing Day. Take this to the hotel. Hold on. What's your name? Ernesto I'm Hans... I'm going to ask you a favor. I've got some instruments here which are destroyed by simply... looking at them. Try to dodge the potholes, and if a train comes, or an ostrich or a hare... you keep your cool, okay? The train comes on Saturdays, and it's already here... and there are no ostriches, that leaves only the hares and the potholes. Yes, the potholes. Don't worry... Thanks... This is for your mother, there's less every time. Where can I rent a car? I've got one for you. No, you shouldn't have bothered! If you don't like the hotel, you come over to my house. No, I don't want to be a bother. Maybe if it were for a few weeks only, but I'm staying much longer. You'd end up kicking me out. You? Never. Leave that, it's mine! The rocks are mine. What's going on? No, that's not mine. You idiot! I told you there were mine. Hey kid, don't insult me! Are you carrying rocks there? Would you show me one? Do you collect rocks? It's beautiful I also collect them. What for? It's my job. Here. Someday you'll let me try my luck against the train. Maybe one day I'll beat it. Is it a deal? It's a deal. What happened? I had to go to the town. I took a foreigner to the hotel! A tourist? Tourists never come here. No, he's a German geologist... hired by Andrada to search for oil or something like that. He's German but he speaks like a Spaniard. Is she busy? Yes, she's with Elsa. If you have another leak you get straight into bed... and you call me right away. Don't try to be tough, OK? Take half a pill a day... and I'll see you in two weeks. Thanks Ana. You're welcome. Patricia? The medical samples arrived. I guess I still have some friends left, put them in the drawer. Hi... All this oil story sounds like a pipedream to me. I'm just repeating what people are saying. Well, if our councilman Andrada is involved... it must be something dirty. Maybe this man is not even a geologist. Maybe he isn't. At least he has money. He gave me a twenty dollar tip. If he has money, then he's not a geologist. What are you going to do with this money? Don't you need it? Keep it. Buy yourself a perfume... so you can quit using mine. Are you going to mass? I'll be right back! You keep out. - Hi! - Hi... How's your little sister? Getting better... Aren't you coming? There's no mass. You can always pray... I'm not Catholic... Are you Jewish? No, I'm not. My Mom is Jewish, but not my Dad. And what are you? What do I know? Nothing I guess. You have to believe in something. Don't you believe in God? No... You're strange... Are you staying around here? I'll see you later... Would you like to go in? Come on, don't be scared. Nothing is going to happen to you... Cut it out, Nelda... That way you can scare your parents. Father Damian has sent his excuses; He will be away until... the Saints celebrations. Make a list... of all the children to be baptized and... for first communion. Those of you who were thinking of getting married... give it another thought, and anybody planning to die will have to postpone it. The Cooperative Society will assemble in the barn. Please take only what you need... to replace the essential goods... as we won't have money... until after the shearing. Things are rather complicated. Mario will explain. At your age, sugar is not good. At my age I don't need vitamins. Honey and mate don't mix well. Well, your going to take these pills... don Gregorio, OK? One per day. They'll work wonders. Are you going to take them? The slickers can pressure us but they won't show their cards. That would expose their power. Let's hold on a bit more. If anybody has a problem, we'll all help out. But shearing cannot be delayed. It can't! Of course. I'm not saying that. Let's go ahead but we keep the wool. Andrada's offer is not bad. We might lose 15%.. - 15%? - I estimate 30% maybe even more. That maybe true, but it's better to cash in now rather than in a month. Later he might refuse to buy. I don't think so, but there is a certain risk. That's the price for avoiding being pushed around. Do as you like, Juan... This is a Cooperative, not a jail. If you want to quit, tough luck. Excuse me, Don Mario. Mr. Andrada would like to speak with you. Whenever you want, you can stop by his ranch. He'll be waiting for you. Did he say what for? Business, he said. It's urgent. Tell him he'll have to wait a few days... twenty or thirty days... until his friends announce... the price for the wool. Then we'll talk. Okay, I'll tell him.. He also sent a message for you, don Juan. To go and pick up your check... the sooner the better I'm not going, Zamora. Tell Andrada that... I sold my wool to the Cooperative. He'll have to deal with don Mario. I'll tell him. But he won't like it. Are you threatening me? I'm a peaceful man, don Juan. I mean it as a friend. Thank you, Zamora, but as far as I know, you're nobody's friend, so save your advice for somebody else. Thank you, Juan... I think everything will be OK. Andrada will have to buy, because he has... to sell. This is for you. Why are you giving this to me? "The Call of the Wild", I have two of them. Thank you. It's a nice story. It's about a dog in Alaska. You'll like it. Read it and then tell me. I can't read, Ernesto. You'll have to return that, Ernesto. The guy made a mistake. Mom said it was okay! What did I say? To keep the tip! Mom's also mistaken. The man has no idea of money's worth. And it's a tip. Why must you take tips? Just stick to your price, and don't accept charity. He's right.. Be strong, boy. Sometimes you've got to lose. That doesn't mean you can use my perfume! What perfume? Perfume? Who said anything about a perfume? I don't know... Okay. Fix up the table, the food is almost ready. My hearing is getting worse everyday. Excuse me... Bye Ernie. Have a good rest. Why don't you undress and get into bed? It's late already. You have to sleep. I'm not sleepy. Then you walk about in a daze all day. You're hardly sleeping four hours per night. You won't feel well. Good night... The rain fell heavily... during three days. Very well... "The rain fell heavily" for three days". Where is the subject in this sentence? - The rain... - Very Good... "fell heavily during three days" is the... Predicate... Predicate. Very good... The rain... What happened with the rain? Let's see, what did the rain do? Pay attention... Dad...;Dad! Yeah? It's the geologist. Come with me... You finish copying. - Good Morning... - Good Morning. Sorry. I didn't intend... coming up to here. It's all right. No problem. I'm a bit lost. Is this the way to Bermejo Valley? Yes. The road goes through the town. I'm not going there. You... what are you doing here? You go to this school? No, I live here. I can't help it. He's my son... Obviously you don't let him skip class. But I'm not going to town. I'm heading to the valley, to Andrada's ranch. There's a bypass... some ten kilometers from town... But that won't get in... There's no road; You'll need a four wheel drive I'll get as far as I can I can walk. I have strong legs. Ernesto has something to tell you. Excuse me, I must carry on. Thanks. You made a mistake. You gave me too much money. You earned it. But this is a tip. I charge a fee for my work. I can't accept this. Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. Come on! Come on! Come on! I think it's time I stuff my Spanish pride and accept... your suggestion. I'll rent the horse. Dumas? Dumas is not for rent. We can ask don Cosme. Maybe he has a good horse. Only Dandy. The rest are raw material for hotdogs. Could I keep it here? The hotel is nice, but it doesn't have any stable. - I'll look after it. - Good. Rent it for three or four months... maybe more. What are you going to do in the valley? Oil. Councilman Andrada is convinced.. There's oil on his land. Totally bizarre. Well, if there isn't any oil, I'll pack my stuff... - and return to Madrid... - Madrid? I'm from Madrid! Really? How's that? We were there eight years; Ernesto was born there. Whereabouts in Madrid? Cuatro Caminos... I live just beside Plaza de Castilla, in Colonia del Carmen... - Hello... - Hello! Ana, my wife... this is Hans... Hans Mayer... Andrada's friends are not welcome... in this house. Hi... I'm not his friend. I only work for him. Anyway, I was on my way out... Would you lend me your pants? Yes, of course.. If that's how it is, you can stay. I'm sorry. I accept your apology... but I still have to go. Here... Come on. Take it. It's not a tip... it's for saving me from the quicksand. - Goodbye... - Goodbye! Bye... Did he kiss your hand? No, he did like this... Is that how they greet in Spain? Only with princesses. Your mother is a princess. I had lost my palace... and this man has discovered me! And I don't know what to do with my life! Keep a loose grip. Use your knees. Fine, what else? Don't pull too much or he'll balk. What he likes best is to trot. So try to make him trot, and don't be afraid. If you're afraid, he'll know and then you're screwed. What did you say his name was? Dandy... He must like it. - And to start him? - Use your heels. A privilege for the few! High society kids... always took riding lessons. Good Morning! The boss has gone to the city. He won't be back soon. But if you changed your mind I can phone him. No, this is not about the wool. It's about your daughter. Luciana? What is it? My son tells me that she can't read. Didn't she go to school? No. When her mother died she had to... take over the house, the kids. Whenever she can she joins the women here. Makes some extra money. That helps. She's hard working... she can't go around wasting her time. Maybe we can arrange something... I would like her to come to school... It doesn't have to be every day until she learns to read and write. Did she ask you? No, but I don't think she'll refuse. Her opinion doesn't count. I'm saying no. Look Zamora, you're a good father. It's not easy for a man to raise kids all by himself... as you have done, but someday... they'll have to fend for themselves. Then, they'll remember you. And getting a job being illiterate... Someday Luciana will be put to run this place, just like her mother. She won't need to... look for another job. She won't find a better place than here. Because if it was good enough for her mother... than it's good enough for her. Don't give her any funny ideas. Stay out of my life. Is it hard to teach someone to read? Not if other person is willing to learn. If you show me how, I'll try to teach her. OK, but don't let the old man find out... if Zamora catches you, he'll kick your ass. He won't know. The key is to keep... the student interested. You can use the book you gave her.. But don't just read. What else, then? You'll think of something. BERYLLIUM... It's a variation of emerald. This is Galena, the transistor's grandma. It has crystals which are sensitive to radio waves... so you can pick up a station using a needle and a little bit of patience. You never had problems? Yes. Several, luckily! Holy shit! Sorry sister, but this pepper... stings like hell! It's a very small chili... and very hot. It's called "God dammit." "God dammit"? That's about right! Luckily the priest rarely comes by. I've been warned... If they wish, they can expel me. She doesn't wear habits because she's still a novice. Nun's habits set a distance. I never use one. It's like telling people... "I'm different." That's not how I think. If you're still a novice, then I still have a chance. I'm a downright nun. She's saying that to keep you away. Although nuns can drop their habits... or lift them up. Every time some attractive guy shows up... they organize a dinner to hook me up. Not because they love me. They're just atheists and anticlerical. You're very pretty Nelda, Seems strange that you're only married to God. He got you there, Nelda. Come on, fling up your slipper! What should I do? Drop everything and go to Spain? Hold it! I haven't proposed anything yet! It's a passing proposition. A "quickie". Hey, don't be vulgar! Don't listen Ernesto. Really Nelda, what made you become a nun? I can't spot any trace of... hysterical mysticism in you. Another heathen. I can do what I do because I'm a nun. I would've liked to have a family, but instead I chose people. You've never felt anything... for anybody? Fall in love you mean? Once, I thought. But I preferred not to find out. She did find out, but she got scared. Scared of being your in-law! Don't give up, Spaniard. If I ever change my mind, it won't be with a married man... with four kids. How do you know I'm married? At your age, if you're not married or have kids... Then I must be gay or have some mental issue? Well, not really... I'm not crazy, but I've been married... twice. And divorced. No kids, and that bugs me. I would relapse with you... if you guarantee... a baby girl with your eyes. Well, well, well. - Well what? - Don't listen Ernesto! The stew is ready. Can we eat? I use my surname Plaza... to show that I'm not German. Mayer Plaza with a "Y"? Yes... Mayer Plaza sounds very posh. Sounds like a five star hotel. Now, people don't ask me if I'm German... Now they call me "Hans from the Mayer Plaza" I keep repeating I have no accommodations. - Is Mayer Jewish? - No, it's Nazi... - Nazi? - Yes, Nazi... My father was in the Condor Legion. Some Republican made a hole in his plane, he bailed out... but somehow his Swastika got effaced... and he landed in the hospital. My mother was a nurse, and she had to take care of him. They fell in love. The war was over for him, he deserted. And my mother was deserted. My mother's rich family turned their backs on her. I came in at the wrong time, as usual. When I was born, they didn't have anything. No money. Until I was about twelve... we were on the ropes. - Tough times... - I got it. Worse than tough. But one day Grandpa died... and apparently he forgot to disinherit my mother. She was an only child... so we became millionaires! We bought a house, two cars we hired a maid... a housekeeper. But later on, the Prussian officer... went after girls. My mom started drinking, My little brother went in the army and I became an anarchist. I found my vocation selecting rocks to throw at Franco's police. Did you become a deserter? No, I didn't have the guts. - "There's something else..." - You deserted, just like your father... Same story again. You deserted all that was expected... of you. "Until he killed his father." Only then he became a person. Somebody with true potential. My father's alive. In five minutes they'll prove... to you that you were wrong. Homemade psychoanalysis is more popular than soccer here. Easy on the wine. - I've only started. - In a moment he'll say... "There's no shrink... like a barman". There's no shrink like a barman. The generating word here is "call". CHANGE, CALL, GIVE, MEASURE. Copy up to here. You're doing all right. It was an old flat, with plenty of light... very beautiful. Before that, we lived a year in Paris. But Madrid was the best. - Buenos Aires... - Not by a mile... Objectively you can't compare them. Now if you put in your feelings... that's something different. Feelings are there. But they're also in Madrid. I miss Madrid more than Buenos Aires. We were very happy there. I don't know why we came back... We came back because we never really left. There was no other choice. Were you part of the Montoneros? No, just Peronists. Not even that. Our "comrades" sacked Mario from the university. He was a Sociology professor. I was a fool, they used me. Don't talk about that now. Then things started getting worse... people began to disappear... close friends. One night we came home and found the military inside. We barely escaped. We escaped, but they got Ernesto. Ernesto was my brother... He had nothing to do with it. They were after me. At that moment we were in Brazil. We'd been hiding in Buenos Aires, then crossed the border to Brazil. We never told him anything, so he didn't have to worry. It was worse. What could he say if he knew nothing? - I'll make more coffee? - No, I'll do it. Hans, when you have some time... could you talk to the kids? Give them a lecture about geology. No rush... Yes, I can talk. As for teaching, I'm not patient with kids. And this stuff about rocks can't be taught... like reading or math. Sorry for the lame moment, Hans, but it's over now. - Lame moment? - Lame moment, sad moment. One risks falling into a hermit's cave. But it's over now. I'm not worrying. And you shouldn't be apologizing. The way you carry ahead, how long have you been here? Three years? - Four years... - After four years in a place like this, I would be worse... I'd be talking to the moon. It's a place like any other, neither better nor worse. That is mysticism. But your case is more complicated. I understand that you wanted to leave Madrid... but why leave Buenos Aires? You're neither hippies nor green activists, nor Franciscan monks. We had to choose, Hans. To live like tourists in Madrid, or like middle class vegetables in Buenos Aires. It was Nelda's fault. She told us what she was doing here... and that she felt lonely, and that was it. That's a big lie. It was their own idea. We had some dollars saved up in Spain, which we used to start running the Cooperative. We built the shed for the chapel, financed the first community purchases. What we do is real, you can see it. It makes you feel good. We do miss many things, but it's bearable. So between the three of you, you control education, health, faith, and the economy of Valle Bermejo, and its surroundings. Am I right? Sounds dangerous when you say it like that. Please don't repeat it. We're not in control, we just help. That humbleness hides the Red Flag... follow our example world proletarians! Proletarians? They're not even farmers! Some of them have to rent the land... but most of the Cooperative members own a little piece of land. I would've preferred something else, but at least it's something. It's a good start. The farm... then the town, the province, the world! May God hear you! Your idealism is very touching. Is that good or bad? It belongs to another world. Kids starving to death... belong to another world? You think they come to school to learn? No! They come because here they can eat... at least once a day! You have to be realistic! This is south of the Rio Grande, comrades! Friends, if you please. When the world was distributed, you got the worst part, friends. You sound like a fascist priest: "It's God's will, take it and shut up." Not God, the multinational corporations. Don't argue with the girls, Hans. They're ferocious and they'll beat you up. He deserves it! In the end, we're all on the same side: The losers... Lose the battle but not the war? No. The war is lost, but at least I would like win one battle. Who can beat that? With Mario yes... But you? You're a male chauvinist... A primate... The war was won by the primates. The energy of the species against Christ, Marx, against Bakunin. A triumphal regression to the Age of Darkness. Each one up his own tree. Liberty, Fraternity, bullshit! Sounds very nice, but it's boring. We're primates, we can't change. Risk, adventure, and the struggle for life... makes us feel alive. We enjoy bashing our neighbor's head, and eating up his liver. But always adding some garlic and parsley, to make it civilized. Let's go, Dumas! That son of a bitch! Let's go Dumas! Luciana... - Luciana! - What are you doing here? Is your Dad home? On Saturdays he goes to the fields... he won't be back until tonight. Don't tell him I was here. I'll teach you to read, if you want. I don't know... It's hard for me. I don't want you to waste your time. Let's try. It's too much for me... I told you. No, it's because you're left handed. It's always more difficult for left handed people. Haven't you noticed everything is made for right handed people? If you were Jewish you'd be OK, because they read backwards. You write in Jewish too? Only a few words. - Write something. - Not now. Some other day. Now, let's carry on with that. That's because you don't know. Give me a paper. What is it? My Grandma always sings it. It's a lullaby of some sort. What does it mean? As beautiful as the moon, sparkling like the stars. Come on, carry on. - Here you go. - Thank you... Easy, kids, it's boiling hot. Here, you carry on. What's this for? It's a theodolite. It's used for taking measurements. But to explain, better join me and see. I can't, I'm in class. - After, then. - Would you like to be a geologist? - Do you make a lot of money? - Like any other job. Some talent, lots of luck. And a lot of "yes, sir". If you care about money, you'll have it. You'll be a shit like me, but with money. Hans! I didn't think you'd come. I have something for you. Look. An echinoderm, a fossil. For your collection. You may find more around. What are these blueprints for? Does Andrada want to... build a dam? No, he thought they could be useful. These are from an old project. Andrada doesn't want water, he wants oil. He likes money, like you. Get going... I'll show you how this works. You have to walk respectfully... we're stepping on the bottom of the sea. Look over there. External nucleus, outer stratum, and cortex. I'm sure you all find the mountain very boring, and to prevent that, we'll walk on a ball of fire. Exciting, a great adventure. What if I told you that you do this every day? Day and night you walk over a... thick carpet, but in fact... you're walking on molten fire. Because, strange as it may seem, nothing remains still, nothing is what it seems. For example, people say that if you talk to rocks, you're insane. That's partly right. One must not talk to them... but let them do the talking. First, you must understand their language. Just like with people, right? This rock... what is this rock saying? Let's see, you... and you? Does the rock say anything to you? Not a word? I can hear it... because I know its language. It tells me stories of millions of years ago, of thunderstorms, of rains. I can see dark skies and lightning, and animals and plants, like this leaf... driven by the storm until this was formed. This, which seems like a silly rock. Nothing is silly, nothing is too small... Ice, for instance, is the mountain's worst enemy. When it rains, the water goes through the cracks, and at night, it becomes ice. It grows, and it breaks the rock. Slowly, it disintegrates the rock. The mountain knows it, and groans... she can't defend herself, but she groans. A humming is heard before a storm... they call it the "bees' song". Because it's like a spluttering of sparks... like a humming of bees. Some people say it's the air loading up electricity, but I prefer to think... it's the mounting moaning. Knowledge brings us closer to magic. This is not magic, but it's fantastic. This light is called ultraviolet light. It carries us deep into caves... with this we can paralyze the cave monsters. Come close everybody. Listen! This light can paralyze the cave monsters... but it's also useful for other things. To prove it, we need complete darkness. Turn off the light, Ernesto. Only in darkness you can see the rocks' soul. Look at this one. Look! Do you see it? Each one has its own soul, in shape and color. This one is called axinite, a word that comes from the Greek. When the Greeks talked to this rock, they would call it axinite or something like that. Here, you take it, but be careful, you can't look straight at this light. It doesn't work with people, it's only for rocks. For people... well, nothing has been invented yet. "Once and again upon observing the brutal punishments..." "Buck understood the lesson:." "A man armed with a stick..." "was the lawmaker, a master that had to be obeyed..." "although not necessarily loved." What happened to your face? Where? Oh nothing, I cut myself shaving. Not necessarily loved. "Buck was never guilty of this feeling..." "but he saw other dogs beaten until defeated..." "who adored the man, wagged their tails..." "and licked his hands..." It's your turn now... "Once and again..." "Once... and again..." - "upon observ..." - Upon observing. Looking. I know what is to look, I'm not stupid. OK, carry on... "Upon observing... the bru..." I can't. Let's quit. I can't. Come on, try again. I'll read it again. No, leave me... Some other day, then. But do the exercises. It'll help... I can't. I don't have time. Before going to sleep.. I can't. I fall asleep! Better leave it, Ernesto. Some people study by night... they study very complicated things... You have to want to learn, that's all... I want to, but I can't. I'm slow. I already told you! Is it easy for you to clean the bosses' shit? You like that? You'll do that for the rest of your life? Somebody has to do it! But not you! Even if I can read, I'll continue here... I will never leave this place! Who says that? Your Dad? He says that, because he was born a slave, but you weren't. Why not? Because you say so? Leave me alone! If I read... or clean shit it's my problem. Nobody else should care! I do! I care! Why? Because! He's in fine shape, congratulations. Credit to my son... You realize Vallejo? They plan to beat us. Make your bet, Andrada. I don't like to take from the poor, but... I'll bet. Let's have some wine, Juan... This friend from Buenos Aires wants to meet you. Don't take bribes, Juan... That would be throwing money away. Have you decided on the wool, Dominici? The offer still holds. I thought you didn't like to take from the poor. When the official price is set, we'll talk. When the official price is set, you'll have to stick the wool up your asses. I can't believe nobody tries to keep something. If they do and they're caught, they're out. It's not worth the risk. My Dad says that you're all communists, that you deceive people... mess things up. You believe him? - Those are Andrada's words. - He's the one cheating people. Old church zealots! What the hell... Not very pious language, Sister. Come on man, you can't refuse me. We have to celebrate. Where are the kids, Luciana? Have they eaten already? They're playing, I'll go and get them. Wait for me at the chapel. What's going on? Come... "Once again, upon ob-ser-ving..." "the brutal punishments..." "Buck understood the lesson:." "A man" "armed... with a stick..." "was the..." lawmaker... A master who "had to be ob-eyed..." Although not necessarily... loved. Thank you. You read very well... I understand what you're saying, Sister... But nothing justifies... your refusal to wear a nun's habit. It turns your words... into God's words! God's word is God's word either way... They can't hear God's words, and not because of my clothing. God is for humans, and before talking about God... I have to see that they live... like human beings. Please excuse me a moment, Father. What is this? What were you doing? We were reading. Sure... when I go to the sacristy, you beat it! Don't let the Father see you. Hey, Andrada! Where's Juan? I saw him a moment ago... the guy was celebrating. Carry on betting, gentleman... - On Jengibre... - Jengibre. 10000 on Jengibre! Nobody matches it? There he comes. Here I am... Here I am! Everything is OK... - Bring Dumas along... - This is Dumas. Very cunning, Andrada... I didn't do anything. He got drunk on his own. I'm not drunk, I'm happy! And even if I'm drunk, I'll beat Zamora! Careful... What a way to screw things up! I sold the ranch, don Mario... I sold it to the foreigner, I couldn't avoid celebrating. Help me, I can... No, no... Lay off, man... The race is suspended. Nobody else can ride? Ernesto can race... and win. Don't let him, Mario... No, no... Of course not. This isn't for kids. What about Hans? He's small but he can ride a horse. Very funny, Sister. No, not me. He's better than me, better than Zamora... and anybody else. Well, it seems that it has been accepted. It has been accepted that I will not race. He can't race. He's Andrada's friend... He can't compete against him. Employee... Just an employee. Come on, courage, man. If you win I'll fire you... but don't worry, you can't win. This is for the expenses... I'll bet the rest on Dumas! Are you crazy? That's the Cooperative's money! Count it Andrada. See if you can match it. I don't have to count it, I'll match it. We're still without a horseman. Who will ride? Mario... What are the rules? - Get there first... - OK. Careful. I might touch you... with my whip. Go screw yourself! - Ready? - OK... Come on Zamora! Come here you old Spaniard... You're a natural gaucho! I hope you're just as lucky finding oil. I'll need a couple of wells, to recover what I've lost today. Ernesto! Ernesto is the winner! Ernesto, Ernesto! - Good afternoon... - Good afternoon. Come and help me, Ernie. Get moving! Are you asleep? - Dad... - Yeah? Can you talk to Mom? Of course I can. What about? Did you screw up? Luciana and I were inside the church... and Nelda found us. So what? She threw us out... We were behind the altar... She came in with the priest, and... But... What happened? What were you doing? Nothing, just reading... But Nelda didn't believe us. She must've told Mom. Reading? I promise... Okay, I'll talk to her. Anybody wants tea? Please... How's Nelda? Did she want anything? She's fine. Just wanted to chat. She looked worried. Anything wrong? Nothing... Women stuff... you know... Coward... Nelda's no squealer. The vaccines are ready... At a hospital in San Luis. We have to go and get them. That's good news, at last. When are we going? On Saturday. We can stay until Sunday. What do you think? Can we go to the movies? Of course. Not me. I have to go to Las Salinas. What fascinates me about you... is your youthful enthusiasm... that love for life. Enjoy a little bit! You can go to Las Salinas on Friday. And on Saturday we go to the capital. Doctor's orders! No arguments allowed. Dad, thieves! They're in the corral! Stay in here, don't go out! Mario! No, no, no! Leave them, Ernie! Nothing to worry about Ernie. Is it broken? No, but it was a close shave. You'll have to keep still a few days. Until they beat you up again. They won't stop until they kick us out. Let them go on! I was sacked once... They won't do it again. It's against me. You're not Jewish. I'm tired of playing... the anonymous hero. It's not against you. They pretend they're Nazis just to harass... Andrada is doing this to pressure us... to get the wool. What are you going to do? I'll break his neck. He'll get you in jail... You have no proof against him. Go to bed, Ernie. You have to be up in two hours. Let's do something. We won't say anything... So the Cooperative won't know. You did a good job. I'll go and cover up the signs, and skin the sheep. - Now? - Before the kids get to see it! Can I help you? I'll prepare the lime. We know how fear works... Somebody finds out, gets scared shitless... and will want to sell. Why don't you prepare some mate. - It's all over... - I'm tired, Mario. Go to bed. I'm sick and tired. All this is useless, absolutely. Don't get worked up now. I'm with the sick people, but my mind is somewhere else... I have to go to Las Salinas but I don't want to. Shall I tell them they'll get cured? I know they won't get cured. Nothing will change. What shall I tell the drunk? "Don't kill yourselves... alcohol is bad for you... life is beautiful?" Please! And they keep on bringing... children into this awful world. Don't they realize? I think they do, Ana. But they also see you, which makes them think... not everything is rotten... Come on, go to bed. This is not the right time to talk about this. We'll talk during the trip. I'm not coming. I want to stay alone. You two can go. I can't drive. I know, but please don't force me. Let me be alone. Luciana... What are you doing here? Are you crazy? We might be seen! Why did you come today? We said Saturday! I'm going to the capital. I came here... to tell you. You're leaving? To live? No, just a little holiday. I'll be back on Monday. I brought you more exercises. But you do them, okay? Okay, but leave now before they see you. Bye. I'll see you on Saturday... the next one. - Everything ready? - Yes, everything. Got enough money for the hotel? Yes. Take care... Lock up the house at night. Don't open if you see something strange, okay? Nothing will happen... They won't try again so soon. But... just in case. Don't be scared by thunder. And if they want to rape you, just relax and enjoy it... Don't be a wise guy, you can't scare me. Have a good time! Take care of your arm! And look after Ernesto... Did you bring your toothbrush? Wait, I got it. All this because he's an only child. With four kids it would be different. Four toothbrushes? You're right. Jewish mothers are worse than Italians... My mother was just like Ana. Why didn't you have more kids? Decision or fate? I didn't want to. We wanted a second child... but it took too long... later on, I didn't want to keep trying... I'm 52. With a family tendency... to die young. I'm scared not being there to watch him grow up... to protect him... I'm afraid with Ernesto, imagine with a new baby. Did we forget something? What do you have there? Clothes... I'll need them to change! I may be crazy, but I still have to be clean... On Sunday 25th we'll be at... Valle Bermejo chapel all day. I wanted to ask people to come... with their kids, it's important to vaccinate them. We'll have a pick-up truck, I mean two trucks, because a Spanish friend... will help us to bring people... from the neighboring towns. Sunday 25th, vaccination for Sabin and Triple. Valle Bermejo chapel! We need sneakers, old clothes... powdered milk, alcohol, band-aids... Whatever you... can send, will be useful. I don't like to ask for charity, but... the situation is very bad. This one's okay... There's one right here... yeah... John Wayne, he's the best! Please, he's a fascist! Who else can face 20 guys... armed to the teeth... and anxious to kill him, and he escapes, riding his horse in reverse? An yet, make you believe that he was... the most dangerous guy? He could be drunk, beaten up, defeated, in love... But... he never lost his dignity! I can't believe he likes westerns. I like them too! Of course! Good! This boy has to be... larger than life... The best! This place is expensive... If it's good, we'll go in, don't look at the prices... I'm paying! You've been inviting all day, Hans. It's enough... We go in... with one condition. I pay. I'm not paying. It's my friend Andrada who pays! Shall we have a drink? - Another one? - One before last! - That's right... - This time it's on me. Okay... Is the bar open? Yes sir, all night. Room 406, please... Just one drink and I'll go upstairs! Let's go? Hi... do you have cigarettes? Thank you... Do you have...? - I'll be right back... - Where are you going? You plan to carry on? It's four o'clock in the morning... you both need some sleep... I'll take him to his room... Oh no, I can do that myself. - It's higher up... - What? You're one floor short I'm missing one floor... I'll go with you... Where? That way? Okay! I'll be right back! And, who'll bring you back? I'll bring him back. Don't worry... Fuck... you two are wasted... Country! Country! You know the one about the guy who's completely wasted... goes to the Puerta del Sol, and asks somebody... No! It was New Year's Eve, and they were... eating grapes, in Madrid you eat grapes with... well, it doesn't matter... This guy is completely lost, and asks somebody... who's also lost! And he asks him... "Could you please tell me where I am?" The other one says "Hell, at the... Puerta del Sol". "No, no... The country! Country!" Country! Country! Shh! We'll be kicked out... Go away, please. I'll be right back. I'd prefer you don't come back. You got drunk together... then stick together! I can't stand drunks! One moment, one moment! You have no right to talk to him like that... This is a great guy... He's a frontiersman... Drunk or defeated, a frontiersman... never loses his dignity... I mean it... I may be wasted... but I know what I'm talking about. He's in a special class... and so are you... You're a terrific woman... Don't leave him alone... He loves you very much... and so do I... I love you both... very much... I'm sleepy and hungry... We're almost there... There're some cookies in my bag. Wake up... driving alone is very boring copilots are supposed to talk and those two are definitely out. Did you ever get drunk? I can't. Whenever I drink too much, I get sick, I throw up and then I fall asleep. I always miss all the fun. Why is it fun? Sometimes it is. If you get depressed, it can be worse... You lose control. You say and do things you normally wouldn't. Like the light in the rocks, it shows you the dark side of people. It can be sickening, but it can also be wonderful. You'll find out by yourself. I don't like to drink. You will. You're still too young. The laws of genetics never fail... and that thing behind you is your father. I have to see the doctor. It's an emergency! Anything wrong? No, what could go wrong? But I have to see her! What's going on? Doctor, please, can you... take me into the town? I'm busy don Gregorio... When you're finished, could you take me? No problem! You're looking very handsome, are you going to a party? I sold the ranch, doctor! I have to sign the papers. Andrada's friend bought it. The one from the capital. The one that bought Juan's... Yeah, that same guy! You'll have to wait a while. I sold the ranch, I'm going to live in the capital! Forgive us, your Highness... for interrupting your deep meditation... but we have brought the vaccines for your loyal subjects! What are you doing here? Aren't you cold? How did it go? Did you get the vaccines... without any problems? No problems, because I also went. - With Hans? - And Mario and Ernesto... we had a great time... I can imagine. What a temper! What's the matter? Look... I've been promoted. They're sending me to a course in Rome for a full year... then to Buenos Aires... to instruct novices. Can't you refuse? I'm a nun, Ana... I made a vow of obedience. Take the vaccines, Ernesto. Leave them in the sacristy! Or behind the altar... you know where, don't you? Yeah... You know when you're leaving? Did they tell you? No, I don't know. Maybe in a month or two... when my replacement arrives. A stiff who'll wear the habit everywhere... even to sleep. If you quit, you could stay. I'd love to. But I can't. You will... Leave it to me! They don't like what I'm doing... They never did, but the priest's report... was decisive. That son of a bitch says I'm... an anarchist, an anticlerical apostate. Except pretty, everything... Wrong, you are pretty. But he's right about everything else. If you weren't a nun it wouldn't bother you... it would be a compliment. Where are you going gaucho? Are you lost? I'm coming to see Mr. Zamora, to tell him vaccination is on tomorrow at the chapel I think he left early. I'll find somebody. I'll leave a message. Bye! This time I did them all. As you said... I get up and study when they're all asleep. Can you check them to see if they're correct? Very good... You're doing well, Luciana I don't know why I never taught before, but I think soon... you'll be able to read and write... whatever you want. How would I know when this happens? You'll be able to read and write! I know, you fool! I mean if I'll see you... If you'll keep coming here. - If you want, yes! - Okay. Shall I read now? Okay. "Buck learned to take off..." with his teeth the ice... that... acc-u-mu-lated". Lu... Am I doing it wrong? I think I love you. You better go, it's late. Why are you upset? I'm not. Then what's wrong? I know you won't come here anymore! Why do you say that? I said I would. I know you said it, but you won't you'll leave... Where will I go? I know you'll leave... You'll go back to the capital. Because you don't belong here, you're from the capital... and people from the capital always go away. Ernesto! Stop! Leave him alone! I'll show you, you whore! No, Dad! Leave him, please! Listen, kid, you're lucky you're not getting... your ass kicked today. You'll leave as you came... but I don't want to see you here again! Understood? If you feel like fucking, get one of... your own people, not my daughter, understand? Now get out of here... Beat it, you little shit! Ernesto, leave what you're doing... and go with your father... hurry. - Where's he going? - To speak with Andrada, don't let him get into trouble. To the ranch? But I'm classifying... my rocks! You can do that later. Hurry! - Hans is here! - That's better... Wait here, I'll be right back. I'm coming with you! Why don't you go see Luciana? Hello Zamora, how are you doing? What do you want, professor? Just a little chat, if it's possible. We have nothing to talk. I mean your boss. He has nothing to do with it... I don't know what this kid told you... but I don't want to argue with you! I meant what I said, I don't want him around here. So take him away! You'll have to see him for a while... he came with me and he's not leaving, is that clear, Zamora? Unless you want to kick us both out. I want to talk with your boss. And I don't want to... argue with you either. Sounds like this time you really screwed up. I promise I didn't do anything. Let me explain. Not now... We'll talk at home. Don't touch anything, boy... Drink it slowly, it's prime stuff. I can't taste whisky... the local one would've tasted the same to me. Before we start haggling, let me tell you that... the price went down. It's the market. Bad luck. But I didn't come to talk about wool. What's going on with the land, Andrada? You're buying everything... Old Gregorio's, Juan's, Eliseo's... They say there are more. The land is useless. What do you want it for? I haven't bought anything. Don't bullshit me, Andrada. Leave us alone for a moment, boy. Go and play. Stay, Ernesto. Kids talk too much. He's not a kid anymore! I won't say anything he can't hear, will you? I don't know what you're after... or why you stick you're nose in my business. I care about my people not getting screwed! Nobody's screwing anybody! You lefties always think... all businessmen are crooks. Surplus value... Explain to him the concept of... surplus value. He already knows it. He thrives on it. And through buying the worst land... in the province. Let's talk seriously, professor. A client from Buenos Aires... wants some land to build... a country club, with a pool and everything. Weekend tourism. What's wrong with that? That I don't believe you. That's you're problem. This is bullshit. - What? - It's bullshit! A hydroelectric complex, a dam. Remember the blueprints I showed you? An old project that was abandoned... to be built now with Spanish capital. That's why I'm here. Neither oil nor country club... shit! You won't last long here! Your contract expressly states that... you can't talk about the project! Oh shit! It's true, I forgot. Whatever made them put that? To buy time... to purchase this shitty land... which will go under water? You're going to far, you fucking... Careful, there are children here. Where's the profit? In the expropriation? The government must expropriate... those lands, but they'll pay much more... than what my friend has paid... for them. - Who knows... - So you weren't... screwing anybody, eh? Nobody! Everything is absolutely legal. If you don't believe me, go and report me... they sell, I buy... I'm not screwing anybody! I'm risking money to make a good deal... if it goes wrong, I'll lose! I don't know if you've already bought everything... but I'll talk to the people, so that you don't risk any more money. Talk to them, and see what happens... tell them not to sell, to wait for... the expropriation. Tell them the project is 30 years old... and for some reason... it was never built. But now it's on. A decree may come out tomorrow and everything will be stopped! But it's okay. Go tell them to wait. Maybe the government will pay them in bonds... or in installments. I'll come with you. I'll put the cash on the table... and we'll see who they'll listen to! It'll cost you more. I've got reserves, they don't. They're starving now! Today! But it's okay, go tell them to wait. I'll tell them. You're still living in a utopian world, professor. I'll also tell them... what a son of a bitch you are. I don't know why, but I think we're not... going to be welcomed in this house anymore. So you knew this all along. You could've told me! What for? He would've fired me. I'm a geologist not Jesus Christ. I was hired for a job and I did it. The rest is none of my business. - Okay! - You're not even a landowner... why should I tell you? Andrada's right... you can't do anything! - No? - No! This is south of the Rio Grande, don't you understand! And I live in Utopia! Listen here... - I'm a mercenary... - You said a geologist I go where they pay me. And the multinationals pay... better than anyone. If you behave of course! If you don't, you better do something else! But now everything's changed. Nothing has changed! You opened your mouth right in front of Andrada... Is that behaving well? Anybody can have a bad day. Everything's going to hell, Ernie. Okay, run along... They're waiting to talk with you. - Where? - In the barn. Meetings are meant for speaking out... Who wants to be the first one? Things look bad, don Mario. We have to sell. People can't hold on. We've got nothing. There's little left, but it's still something. We can last a few more days. We don't want to starve... that's why we made the Cooperative. Not only for that. Remember when each one was on his own? What happened? "Yes, sir", "Yes, boss", and get screwed... you bought everything at Andrada's store... paid what he said... you couldn't pay, so he remained a creditor... and held you by your balls! Until you got together. What did we start with? We had nothing! What did we do? Instead of each one eating up his own, we distributed everything. It took us six months to buy... from wholesalers, but we managed. We weren't full, but we weren't hungry either. Why can't we do the same now? We can, but the situation has changed. Now we have the wool, and we can sell it. If we get less, bad luck. We can manage anyway. I think we're about to win. And we shouldn't give up now! But that's my opinion. Let the majority decide. Mr. Andrada says that if we don't sell now, later he won't buy. He called and told us. So now you call him "mister" again... You saw him? I wanted to know. I've been asking... and everybody agrees, don Mario... except you. Have you talked to Nelda? Sister doesn't agree, but she says she's leaving. We'll be staying here. I'm also staying, and I don't agree... Andrada wants to stick it to us... I don't agree. If you let him win now, he'll always win. That's what I think! That's what you thought... until a few days ago. Am I mistaken, or have you already said yes? I think she'll give birth any minute now... her water's broken... Don't worry Elsa... How often do you get the pains? Very often. Put her in the ambulance! Bring my things, Ernesto, and tell Dad to come. He's at the meeting! Tell him it's urgent! I'll take you. Nelda, will you manage alone? Sure. Good luck. Dad... Dad! What are you doing here? Go inside! Where are you going? What happened? Nothing! I'll go and see if Nelda needs help. You go inside! I'll be right back! Stay there! Don't come any closer! Don't be afraid, Ernie, I'm not crazy. Someday you'll understand. Now they'll have to start all over again. They won't have a damn thing to lose. - Mom, last night... - I know... Nelda told me everything... Where's your father? Inside, in the bedroom. And the kids? No school today? No, I gave them a meal and sent them home. Thanks for everything. It wasn't your fault, okay? What happened? Did you get on time? The boy was dead at birth. Go on with your mother... don't leave her alone. Careful! You'll break it! It's fragile! Can you please hurry up? Be careful, it fragile! VALLE BERMEJO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT I'll deliver certificates to those... who finished seventh grade. In fact, nobody deserves it... No, seriously. Each one of you... tried the best you could. Whether you learned a lot or not, it doesn't matter... you learned to think and share experiences. That's what counts. Here, Esteban... Don't lose your certificates, you'll need them... to get jobs at the dam. They'll pay you a bit more. Not much more, just a little. Here, Rita. Roque, congratulations. Same to you, Jorge... Look after yourselves! Keep coming when school is over. The lunchroom is open all summer. Now you know. Come Ernie! Sit down... We were talking with Mom about you... and school, and what will happen now... and all that. You still have a year to go before... high school, but... it would be better if we made plans now. You really like rocks? Do you want to study geology? I like it, sure... I'd also like... to be a teacher. Either way, you have to study. That's what I don't like. You don't like to be bossed around, do you? The more you know, the less orders you'll receive. There's a high school in San Luis but it's too far... you can't go and come back every day... and you're not staying at a hostel. You're too young. I can stay there during the week! I'll travel every weekend. You'd have to live with priests. No, thanks. The best is for you to go to Buenos Aires... finish elementary school where you can carry on... into high school. So you won't have to change. Am I going alone to Buenos Aires? With Mom. As soon as school is over. You'll stay at your Grandma's until... Mom finds a job and can rent something. Aren't you coming? I can't, Ernie... I can't leave all this. When you find your own place... you can't leave it. We'll still see each other often, anyway. Once a month or more often. Either I travel or you two come over. You won't miss me. I don't want to go. I know... I know. Come on. Go put the flag away. Zamora's daughter gave me this for you. I'm sorry... Come on, give me a hand. If you were older, we'd... go for a few drinks and end up crying... under a table for the... women we've lost. Don't worry. Someone once said that what's important is to love... and not be loved. Whoever said that is a... stupid jerk! What bothers me is that there's no... chance of saying "perhaps..." I'm mistaken"... But no, It's always been the same. Here, Spain, everywhere. How long will they take? Five years? Let's say seven. Seven years of good life, good salary, new house... food. And then what? Who makes them return? When the dam's finished... who can tell them to go back to sheep, the vegetable garden, the harvest? No, they can't go back. The place that was theirs doesn't exist anymore. They'll end up scraping by in Buenos Aires... living in the slums. Don't complain. In seven years time there'll be... a lot more people ready to fight for "the cause". You're still in Utopia, Spaniard. You need a solid drink. No, no... I'm about to talk bullshit. Nobody could tell the difference. You would, because I get horny... and go after virgins. Thank God! I was afraid you would... go after nuns. When does the train arrive, Ernesto? Nine thirty and it leaves at 10:00. Well, don't go to the station. You already have... a client. Come to the hotel around eight. - Where are we going? - I'm going to Madrid. Are you leaving? And now you tell us? Did you finish your work? Not yet, but they preferred to... pay me now and send me home... I was becoming a bother... screwing things up. If the military return, here's your home. If not, it's still your home. Come around... some time. I'll be near. Only two hours on a plane. A weekend with me, and... your Sister Superior won't even recognize you. We'll write you. Sure, let me know how things are going... I won't promise I'll answer... I'm terrible for those things. Come on Spaniard, a few lines! The address is easy Mario Dominici, Valle Bermejo, San Luis, and that's it. Bye Spaniard, take care. You too professor, and don't quarrel too much! Oh, no, you all stay here. I want to remember you as you are... and not outside waving goodbye like fools, Sister, it'll be tough but try to forget me. It's been a pleasure knowing you... and I hope the next time we see each other... the pleasure will be much greater. Bye, you crazy fool. Good luck, have a good trip. When we meet again, you'll have to... keep all your promises. I'll try my best. Madame... with all due respect. This is my Grandma's address in Buenos Aires... you can write us there. It won't be necessary. Why did you give him Grandma's address? He doesn't know her. Aren't we going? No... What about my school? I don't know... We still have a year to think about it. We might convince your father... and we'll go together. Anybody wants coffee? It's still hot... - No, thanks... - Not for me. I think I'll take a stiff one. - So will I... - Same here. Can I try? Just a little shot! Please, sir! Keep the line. To register you have to wait in line, but you're too young... I don't think they'll give you a job. I'm not looking for a job. I've come to see Hans... Mayer Plaza... Room 13, to the right. Thanks... Ready. Am I leaving something behind? Of course I am... in every hotel, I leave something. You're leaving the light. This is for you. Take it! If the battery runs out, plug it to a 220. And remember, never aim at the eyes. Let's go... Aren't we taking the bags? Let them do that. Let's go. - What am I taking? - You're taking me, dammit! Aren't you? Let's go... Let's go, Dumas! Go! Go Dumas! - Go, Dumas! - Go Dumas! What a shit head! - Go! - Go, Dumas! Go Dumas, go! Give me five! Faster Dumas! Go! This is the last one! One last favor. Don't wait for the train... to leave, okay? Okay. Thanks for the light. Thank you for the trip. Goodbye, kid. Goodbye. Hans is somewhere in the States, in Texas... or he was, although he felt like staying for good. That's what he said when he sent... the last postcard, a couple of years ago. As soon as we got to Buenos Aires, Mom... found a job at a hospital. She overworks, and we hardly see each other. It's not the money. I also work... and we manage. It seems she doesn't want to have time... to think. She still can't believe that you're not around. She talks about you with certain anger... as if the heart attack had been your fault. I also feel angry sometimes... because I can't talk to you. Sometimes we really need you a lot, old man. After you passed away, in ten days we sold... what little we had left, and moved to Buenos Aires. I finished elementary at a school that also had... high school, just the way you wanted. I still keep the rocks, but that's not... what I chose. I went for medicine. I'm in my third year, and I just won a scholarship. I'm going to Spain. I don't know what I'll do... when the scholarship's over. I can look for a job in Europe... or return to Buenos Aires... if things get better. I'd like you to tell me how can one know... where his place is. I haven't found mine yet. I figure I'll realize it when I'm... in a place from which I can no longer leave. I suppose that's how it is. It'll show up one day. I still have time to find it.
