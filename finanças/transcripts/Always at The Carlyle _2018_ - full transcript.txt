We don't talk about our guests. We don't mention names. We don't divulge any of that information, and that's one of the reasons that people do feel so comfortable to stay here. Um, am I allowed to say that? I'm not even gonna go there. We're not the Pierre, the Plaza where you read it in the paper and all the magazines. Whatever happens here, stays here. When you think you can't be surprised anymore, something will end up surprising you. Are you ever in awe of who comes in? -No. No. -Nothing phases you? I just remember like fur coats and too much perfume on the ladies in the elevators. This room, probably in particular, it's probably had some very elegant evenings, and it's probably had some pretty dastardly things going on. Dastardly, dastardly stuff. You see, if anything ever happened between us, I would sit right at the bar and hope to meet some great-- Can you hear what this woman is saying?! Oh, I wouldn't. I wouldn't for a moment. The place that prides itself for discretion? I'm not gonna blow that. -I can't. - What do you mean? I can't. I can't. I would never share that. I'm not going to answer that. Maybe. Maybe. No, sir, I would never do that because I love this hotel. This is where I grew up, and this is what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life. It's all that, and there's stuff that I probably don't even know, you know, that goes on. I don't know what I'd say that for. -If anything's wrong, cut it. Why would anybody want to stay at a property when they know that they're going to be found out? They come here because they know it's a discreet address. Do you have any fear about this film, that this could blow it all up? No, because we haven't told you anything. -Oh, really? -I hope not. I stay in many different types of hotels, and I'm reasonably happy in a lot of them. But we're talking about love. Like someone you fall in love with, it's the eccentricities that you embrace as much as anything else if not more so. Feeling-wise, feeling of vibration. You feel like the history of like Jackie O or, you know, presidents and princesses and people like that. This is a unique place because you have Café Carlyle, Bemelmans Bar, The Gallery, and the dining room, and not to mention the lobby. Each feel singular. All of these things kind of coalesce into this one beautiful, iconic New York feeling. If you're staying here, you feel like you've made it. Have you stayed here? -I've never stayed here. This would be a place where I would bring a date, like, let me see if this girl can hang, you know? If she can understand this and enjoy it. And if I brought a girl here and she liked it, it was very major for me because, yeah, it was a very exclusive club, it was a very distinct thing. There are no big signs. There is no notable opulence. You are not in a grand hotel of your imagination. You either get it, or you don't. New York City gets loads of tourists from Britain but not like the two arriving tomorrow. This also marks their first visit ever to New York City. William and Kate may use trips like this to further their favorite causes, but they are also the most glamorous expression of the British royal brand. So, when it comes to thinking about where the royal visitors are going to stay, we play a very big role here in the consulate. The Carlyle has great history for the royal family back in Britain. A great grand old hotel in the very British tradition, although it's American and a very American hotel. The Prince and the Princess of Wales have stayed here, Princess Anne has stayed here, the Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex. So, it's rather nice that here is the new generation, and they're staying again. Good morning. Sales. This is Christina speaking. How may I assist you? I was very excited, but I had to hold it in because I did get the phone call when I was in the office, and we couldn't share it with anybody. There were only like four of us in the hotel that knew about it. We are known for our discretion, and we take that very seriously, So, I was adamant of-- my husband didn't even know. Christina's the direct liaison with the consulate. So, she knew. It stayed within a group of people-- Four or five because you can't afford to have something like that leak out. When I told Christina that the choice was The Carlyle, I got the response I expected, which was a very delightful and enthusiastic response but not over the top because that's not the way The Carlyle would be. The Carlyle is groovy simply because it doesn't scream hipness. That's why it is hip, and certainly in the day, anything you might want, comforts-- Anything-- can you remember a request-- When I say "anything", I don't know, you know, if you'd be able to score drugs or anything. -But-- - You might. But you might. I was going out with Jack Nicholson in the '70s, and I think it must have been where he stayed, where he's always stayed. He used to always say, "Good morning, Kim. This is Jack, Jack Nicholson." So, I would in turn say, "Good morning, Jack, Jack Nicholson." He said, "There we go." What happened between me and Jack Nicholson I would never forget. I was on duty, and he came outside to smoke a cigarette. Everybody go back, go back, calm down. Jack, how's it going? There was paparazzi in the front of the hotel. He immediately came out and say, "I will let you take a picture of me on one condition. If you take a picture of me and Ernesto and you bring him an 8x10 the next day, and if Ernesto doesn't show me that 8x10 the next day, you will never get another picture of me." And he went on ahead. He took a picture of us. Jack Nicholson was hugging me, and the guy came a few hours later with the 8x10, and he said, "Please, Ernesto, let him know. Please let him know that I gave it to you." Jack Nicholson is a very funny and very jolly man. "My friend, come on, come on. What can I do for you?" I said, "Sir--" He said, "Oh, no, no, no. You're my friend." Like I'm the waiter, but he's talking, "What can I do for you?" I remember one time when I rang the bell, the guest opened the door, and I was surprised it was Jack Nicholson. He was so upset when I rang the bell. He said, "I don't like when I'm taking a nap for people to ring the bell." And I was like, "Oh, I'm so sorry, sir." And he said, "I'm not upset anymore." And I'm smiling. "Your smile bring everything back together." - He sees you-- -His hair was flying. And show me that smile. Ready? And... Oh, yeah, I get it. For years, there was that wonderful Irish receptionist on the phone, and she always knew you, and she was always incredibly happy to hear that you were back and staying. He's my favorite celebrity guest. He calls me Lauren. He says, "How are ya, hon?" And sends me an orchid every time he comes. For years, always an orchid 'cause that's the kind of man he is. He's a real cool guy. I share it with all the operators. We put it in the telephone room, and, you know, it's just nice to see, and he writes the card, and he's just such a regular guy, old school. You pick two people from Hollywood that are both obviously incredible luminaries but also very well-connected socially. And so, when Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson would stay here, I think they were referred to as the "Jet Set." There was a certain level of chic to them that, you know, someone like-- a lot of our contemporary stars do not have. This hotel, when my dad was at his-- the top of his game, it was a really chic place. You were right there with... you could be in St. Moritz, Gstaad, London, Paris. New York, this was it. The Carlyle. I'll be talking to you about the people who stay here, but I try to be as discreet as possible. So, when people ask you, you don't say. I don't say, no. "Oh, yeah, Mick Jagger's in town." Well... I say that to my girlfriend. You walk in the door, and you just go back in time, and it's beautiful, and it's elegant, and it's slow, and it's deliberate, and yet Mick Jagger will come out of the elevator at the drop of a hat. So... We had the Rolling Stones like last week and-- Tell us about the Rolling Stones. Just like that, she says, "Oh yeah, it was the Rolling Stones." So, they came in, and they did what? Am I supposed to tell you all this? The people we were dealing with was a whole other thing. Why is that? Magic, magic people, really smart people, really talented people. There it is. Truly talented people. -Yeah, artists. - I think that's the difference between today. - Artists. Yeah. - Yes. Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward would come here quite often, they would stay here. They were filming a few movies at the time. They would get here late, about 9:30, 10:00, and they would want to have a light dinner, nothing heavy. A couple of times, Paul Newman would want a salad, and he would say, "I'm just gonna have a salad tonight, but I'm gonna make my own dressing." He knew all of the ingredients, and he must have been working on this at home. Then one night he came in, he was alone, and he came in and prepared the salad. It was table ten, and I said to him, "Can I taste it?" So, he said, "Sure, taste it." So, I tasted it, and I said, "I think you better stick to acting." So, he laughed, and I said, "No, it's really good." About a year or two later, Paul Newman comes out with this salad dressing, and it's all over the country in supermarkets and restaurants, and he's selling his salad dressing, and I said, "You know, I had something to do with that. It was created right here at The Carlyle." I never got any royalty, but, you know, maybe it's something to think about. Now there is a whole new set of celebrities like George Clooney who have suddenly found this hotel and, you know, use it as their-- He's not that new. George Clooney's been around for a bit. I wouldn't call him a spring chicken. My wife and I stayed here for almost three months last year because this is theroom. You know, it's a beautiful, elegant room. I mean, this is a magnificent hotel. You stay in a suite on an upper floor, you-- you're shocked by the view. Your-- you-- literally, it's breathtaking. Um... I can't get over this view. My God, the colors are so amazing, the park. What's the fair number on the Empire Suite, -in your opinion? -Fair number on it? The asking price is 20. It's ridiculously expensive. Would you pay that? Oh, no, I would never-- no. Th-- I mean, you could-- you could-- you could pay for somebody's school for a year for that. That's just ridiculous. So, the prices are a bit steep. It's okay. You-- you get what you pay for. And I'm not one-- I'm a fairly frugal person. I don't believe in paying for what I'm not getting. What do you think of this room? I haven't had a chance to look around, but it looks pretty nice. How much is this one? What's the price on this one? - About $4,000. - Ooh. Oh, that's better than ten. Are you aware of the other people that are in this movie? No. George Clooney. -Wow. -He's in this movie, and he talks about this room. Yes, He like this room. The Empire Suite. Have you ever had a run-in with George in this room? He said, "Hi, I'm George." Oh, the-- oh! I always think-- well, I'm about to be 55-years-old. So I always am afraid, well, maybe it's just me, and maybe I'm of an age where I just like it to be comfortable and the people are friendly, and, you know, maybe this is something that she won't find as attractive. When we were coming back here this time, I said, "You want to stay at, you know, The Carlyle?" She goes, "Absolutely." Favorite guest. Um, George Clooney. George Clooney. Yes. He can get me nervous. Who's your favorite guest? George Clooney, of course. Yeah, George Clooney. Yeah, of course. George Clooney, "Oh, my buddy, how are you?" George Clooney. He's completely my friend now. I guess I might sound like one of the girls here, -but I love George Clooney. -I actually did run into George Clooney on the steps of The Carlyle, and we had a nice chat outside, and I said, "You like staying here, George?" He went, "I love this place." He said, "It just oozes class." It was many years ago, and I'd stayed at a lot of different hotels, but a lot of my friends had stayed here, and they all just said that this was more like staying at your home. -And-- -How does she like it? She loves it here. It's like a family to her, you know? She knows all the guys, all the-- all the valets and the guys in the elevator. The guys in the elevator are really fun. So, how long you been working at The Carlyle? Oh, 20-- 23 years. - 23 years? -Going on. Elevator operators here at The Carlyle are really the secret sauce. I love them all. I love them all. And I take care of all of them because they take care of me. It's like you're holding your breath. How much longer can-- can this exist? It's completely awesome and, frankly, nuts. One of the guys told me that the elevator was, like, 100 years old, and you know, there's certain things like a wine or a painting that you don't mind being 100 years old. You know, an elevator, you'd like to be a little sort of up to date. I don't want to fly a 100-year-old plane. Is Allen a favorite? Allen's everybody's favorite. That's the one that just brought me up now. -A-double-L-- - Ask him to sing a song. Oh, I will. Oh, I didn't know he sang. I'm an elevator operator here. I've been in the hotel industry for 27 years. Yay! There's a protocol, and you know who you can approach and who you can't if you've done this for a long time. I've mastered the art of the 20-second conversation. What about the story with Bruce Willis? Well, I knew Bruce for years. Tell us that story as you told it to them. Well, I met Bruce years ago before he was famous. We were cast in a play together. I was the lead in it, and Bruce played a Hell's Kitchen Irish drug dealer. It was off-off-Broadway. I was the lead. And Bruce had the smallest part in the play. Now he's a big star, and I work in the elevator. Well, he was here with his wife and his kid and his nanny, and he was getting ready to check out. They got into the elevator, and he wasn't looking at me. So, I called him by his nickname, Bruno, and he just, you know, didn't look up and didn't notice me. So, he said, "Yeah, hi, how you doing?" And I said, "Man, look at me." And he looked up, and he was like, "Oh, man! Allen!" They are probably the people in this hotel that have the most stories and have the tightest lips. It's difficult sometimes to get-- to make them speak because they're so trained to not say anything. I've always been fascinated by elevator operators because I get it when there's a thing where you actually have to operate the elevator, but when you're pushing buttons, I mean, come on. This part I'd mastered, really, at an early age. So, if you have a single woman traveling and she's coming into a hotel late at night, they enjoy having that elevator operator. If you're coming and you just left with your wife and you're coming back with your girlfriend, it poses a bit of a problem. My primary function every day I get in one of these elevators is just to keep grilling them and try and get juicy information on the history of the great hotel. So, for example, the most famous elevator ride in history took place in The Carlyle. Because one of the guys that operates the elevator said to me, "You know, we once had Princess Diana, Michael Jackson, and Steve Jobs all at the same time." Now that is a power elevator. I heard it was silent. It was completely silent until Diana began singing Beat It. You ever get impressed by the names that come through? Oh, yes. Especially the celebrities. Like when Michael came with the kids. - Michael? - Michael Jackson, yes. - Michael Jackson? - Mm-hmm. -He came with the kids? - Yeah, we had to do-- -Uh-huh. - So, what did you put on his pillowcase? - "MJ." -And how about the kids? The kids was their full name. So, you stitched the name "Blanket" on a pillowcase. -On the pillowcase. -That's kinda funny. It's not about wowing a guest. It's about doing something that's really relevant to them, and I think that's when you get the wow. I call it low-cost, high-impact because when people see their monograms on a pillowcase, they cannot believe the personalization and that it's for them. When you see it on the bed that you're about to sleep in, it's just an amazing-- it gets everyone every time. I would hate if I came to stay here and the pillowcases didn't have "MM" on. If you learned that they recycle those. And they use "MM" for other "MM"s? You know, that might take the glamour and the glitz away from it all, but knowing The Carlyle how I know them and their attention to detail for regular clients, they wouldn't do that, they just wouldn't. Kicking up our heat index this morning, the countdown is on for Prince William and Princess Kate's arrival in New York City this weekend. It is the royal couple's first visit to the Big Apple, and they have an action-packed schedule. So, when you heard the royals were coming, were you excited? Yes, I was. Were you really? Yes, I was. Because I never went to England before to meet them. So, actually they come to New York. Room service. Thanks. So, I understand you were working late, and then because of that, you got to stay in the hotel? I had to work at 6:00 in the morning, so since I got off, like, at 12:00, they just, you know, let you stay in the hotel. That night, it was kind of busy in the hotel. I went upstairs to get my key, and to my surprise, I was going to stay in Princess Diana's room, and that was like the only room left. So, I was like "Are you sure?" And then she was like, "Yeah, go ahead. Go to sleep. That's it." I was like, "Whoa! I just got Princess Diana's room." You know, like, I was so happy about it. So, when I got up there, you know, I was like, "Whoa." I started crying. I really started crying. Because it was like-- just to think that Princess Diana used to spend time there, it was like too much for me, and plus the view. Like, it was like, wow. Like, the lights everywhere of the city. The moon was nice. Oh, to be honest, I didn't sleep that night. My mind just went to the past, like, going over where she walked, wherever she was. I was just standing in front of the room, like the living room and watching Central Park and going back to the other room, getting to see the city and just walking back and forth. My co-workers were like, "You're so lucky," because waiters for 20 years, 30 years, you know, they never got the chance to stay in a room like that. How much does that room go for? -Do you know the rate? - Um, $10,000. - Is it worth it? -It is. - Why? -Because of who stayed there. - It's all about who stayed there. -Yes. That was a great night. My floor was bangin'. It was the best floor ever. It was me in one corner, Rihanna in one corner, Stella McCartney in the other corner, and Cara Delevingne in the other. Can you imagine what time that floor went to bed? I came, and I was like, "Who is that?" Then I understood. It was a great floor. So, it's not just the pre-party. It's the after party of the Met Gala. The Met party's always at The Carlyle. Always. Every hotel has changed radically except for a handful of them. My favorite thing, really, to do is to feel like you're stepping back in time, and you know, this one, they give you that. There are times in the world where people like design, and the extremity of the design is tolerated. Art deco is a very extreme form. When you have a hotel, you can attract people by having extreme style, but you gotta be careful, and the thing that is great about The Carlyle is, that it's got these art deco bones, and then there's decoration on top of it. And the decoration is, you know, it's elegance, but it's more playful. The business of interior decorating would not have been a business without her. She had a line in her contract which I think was a very important line. It said, "Dorothy Draper shall be the sole arbiter of taste of the interior." And she became a household name because of the look. Dorothy Draper was retained by Moses Ginsberg at that time. Moses Ginsberg, who was a real estate tycoon of the 1930s. He decided that he wanted to open up a grand hotel to rival the hotels of Europe. He wanted something that would embody what he felt New York aristocratic life was about, which is discretion and the most elegant of everything. Hi, Rebecca. Sorry. -My family built The Carlyle. -Oh. And they're doing a documentary on it. - Do you know why it's called The Carlyle? -No. My Aunt Diana named it after Thomas Carlyle. -How interesting. -Yeah. My grandfather included his daughters in everything that he did, even though the women never worked in the business, and one of his daughters, the second oldest, Diana, she was one of the few women that graduated from college. She went to Cornell, and she was a voracious reader. She was reading Thomas Carlyle and enjoyed his work so much, she thought The Carlyle was a great name. So, it was nothing more than that simple. The way they make you feel when you check into The Carlyle hotel on Madison Avenue in New... York... City... The way they make you feel... it's magical. That's why I like coming to The Carlyle because it's this world with a certain kind of formality that's very comfortable, and it's not a world I grew up in. So, it has an exotic feeling. These paintings should be in a museum. They're really fantastic. We know also, that they were made in 1697. It's spelled W-E-E-N-I-X. It's pronounced "vay-nix." It's a Dutch name. -I'm sorry that I interrupted. -It's not a problem. This is a lobby. This is a lively setting. The two paintings that are here were bought by William Randolph Hearst. They were sold in 1941, and shortly after that, I think it was 1942 or so, that they were at The Carlyle, and they've been here ever since. And I love that they're in a public place. It's quite rare, actually, to have paintings of this quality hanging in a hotel lobby. I've never seen it anywhere. I'm sending a lot of people over here. All my art-history friends. How much are we talking-- Well, art historians tend to not like... to talk about money. Is this five? Thank you. -Oh, my God. -Oh, my God, Five H and J. We came to this hotel when we were about nine months old because our father was made general manager, and we moved in here, and we lived here for 18 years. So, when you say you've lived in a hotel, That's something a lot of people don't get a chance to do. As a kid we traveled a lot with my parents for my dad's film work. So, we stayed in a lot of grand hotels or just places that hosted him at film festivals, whatever. So, I have memories of room service, and I loved it. I loved it, and my dad would say, like, "Sofia, you can't just order orange juice whenever you want. Like $50 orange juice from room service." And I was just like, "I like orange juice." We'd call room service, and, yeah, my parents were horrified, but I thought it was really fun. That's probably around 11. I was coming in the side entrance from the bus, and I was looking down in the foyer, and I see this force of nature in front of me. It was a woman with yellow/red bombastic hair and red lipstick, really red lipstick, and it was Lucille Ball. She had on Capri pants and extremely high heels, and it was like I had to get out of the way of that. And she was chewing gum, and that was so forbidden. That was like, "She's chewing gum? Lucille Ball is chewing gum!" That's what I remember thinking. How naughty. Really? And we got Woody Allen and George Clooney and all of the great premier guests who have stayed here. Left meoff that list. You left me off that list! "The premier guests who stayed here." Well, the guys that got the nicer, fresher rooms. I didn't know there was a room like this at The Carlyle hotel. I thought they all had radiators-- peeling radiators in them, like the one they put me in. So, you had a bad experience? For $1,100 a night or something. Is this useful? It's the most glamorous hotel in the world? - Yeah-- -Can you believe that? I do, I almost believe it more so, in a way, just because it seems so unusual for these institutions, people to stay current and cool. People said, you know, "I both loved and hated your article because now, everybody's gonna know about it." Even people on staff were kind of like, "Oh, you know, that was a great story except for I wish you hadn't told it." Hotels as a rule, as a writer, fascinate me. You're going into a room where other people have been. You're not in your own home even if you live in a hotel. I mean, Tennessee Williams could have been in your room. Mark Twain could have been in your room, depending on the hotel, and you interact with these ghosts in some way. So, the people that die in a hotel. There's the people who are having trysts in a hotel. All of that transience is very romantic to me. I remember going to visit Hunter Thompson when he was doing a piece for us, and I went up to his room, and it was like 11:30. He was having breakfast, he had a bottle of scotch, a bowl of cereal, and a bowl of cocaine. and he asked me what I wanted for breakfast. "I'm fine. I've already had breakfast." Their first tenant was the composer Richard Rodgers. Moses Ginsberg wanted that feeling of instant aristocracy. The first time I came to The Carlyle at all was to Bemelmans Bar. I actually was on a date, and I'd been told to go here and I think it made me look good. I actually didn't know the place, but when I walked in, I thought this is-- this is-- this is a good idea. Bemelmans Bar is really unique. And I don't know of any similarly decorated bars with the kind of personal history that this place has. It is the last place where you can see a public installation of the works of Ludwig Bemelmans. There's nowhere else. This is it. Above and beyond the fact that you could see Madeline on the wall and how beloved Bemelmans' characters from those books are, there is much, much more to Bemelmans, much more than the Madeline books. I really spent most of my time kind of creeping around the room, leaning over people's martinis staring at these walls, and I thought I know this artist but I didn't know the name. This is-- this is not really Madeline literally. It's the style. It's the artistic style of Madeline. So, how did you guys get incorporated on the wall? -Because we wanted to-- -He-- he loved my dad and my mother. He loved my dad, and he just painted a double, you know, baby carriage. Right over here. Twins in a baby carriage. Right here. Here. Right here. With a nanny, and we had a really strict governess-- -We had baby carriages then, too. -We had baby carriages. He was here like in 1947, and we were about two or three. So, pop was an artist also, you know, fundamentally, and so he had a vision for the hotel, that it would be artistic, and so he called him over, and he said, "Listen, come over here and do this bar for me, and I'll give you free room and board for however long it takes you." My mother laughed about how he stretched it out 'cause they loved staying here. So, it ended up being a year and a half. Where did he go after that? They moved to New Jersey. And what I think is uniquely magical about this bar in particular, the little details. You can just totally get lost in these murals. They take you to a place and a time, you know, long... long gone but still connected to this hotel. I mean, those were the days where there were still sheep in Central Park. They did have sheep in Central Park. They cut the grass back in those days. So, you really do see how it's playful and a fantasy version but not too far from reality either. In fact, I made a film that is set in a hotel, and it's-- one of the biggest inspirations is Ludwig Bemelmans. My name is Roger. I'm from Barbados. I love when Bemelmans has his own facial image over here at the end of the bar, and he has his signature down there as well. I don't know what he looks like, but I presume he was kind of old. What happens? Do people ever try to take them? They steal a lot of them, yeah. - They do? - Oh, a lot. Yeah, I gotta-- I've drawn about... 23 or 24 or already. They steal them. Because they think there's value there? -Yeah. - What? They steal them? They steal them. I've been here for the last 28 years. This is actually-- that was my first job, and I believe it's going to be my last. And my best tip I got in this place was amazing. I'm never going to get it again. - What was it? -Was $7,000 one night. I would describe it as quiet as kept. You know, it's like sacred ground to me, and each night is completely, completely different. About a year ago, I was standing in the middle of the room, and suddenly, I saw a man standing on that side of the room with his wife, and I saw another man come in with his wife through this door. So, suddenly I realize that the man standing on the far side of the room was Richard Gere, and the man coming through this door was Paul McCartney with his wife. So, for a second I thought, who should I greet first? Who should I talk to first? So, I just closed my eyes for like half a second, and I thought like, let's go for the Beatle. I heard one story related to Paul McCartney about you, -That his daughter came in-- -That's right. Tell us a little about what happened. I can't talk about that. We can always cut it out, Tommy. I can't. I-I can't. You know, whatever happens here, whatever people are here, you just don't. - Do you miss it? -Yeah. What do you miss? I miss the people and the famous people that come in and the funny things that happen. Yeah, they're good memories. You did mention Liz Taylor. Yeah. She was funny. Tell us about what happened when shewalked in. No. I can't. You can't do that. I told you. I would say we have guests that come in, at least three guests a day that ask, "How's Tommy doing? Where's Tommy? I come once a year. I had this great experience with Tommy." 1958, and I got-- You came over to the States in 1958? Yeah, and I got the job in 1958. Was it because you're Irish? I'd say it helped. I've had situations here where Billy Joel has come in. We have an act now together, practically. He'll come in. I'll take the left side. And he'll take the right side, and then we're be doing it, and people are like, "Whoa, what's happening here?" We'd do Ain't Misbehavin'. We'd do Blue Moon. The amazing part is we have it now down that I'm playing here, we can do the same song, I get up, I go around him, he comes around, I start playing the top. He's playing the bottom. We got the choreography. So, we once joked we should take this on the road. We have a new act, you know. So-- My third day I think it was, Harry S. Truman sitting here, and he always came in and sat here. I didn't know the protocol of talking to a Mr. President. I said, "Harry, would you like a little drink?" The boss said, "Come here, come here. "He's Mr. President to you. You will not be here long!" So, Mr. President said, "Excuse me, sir, can I talk to you? I told that young man to call me by my name." He said, "I'm very sorry, Mr. President. Okay, Tommy, go ahead." If he didn't do that, they were gonna let me go. So, from that time on, it was Harry? No! Great hat. Fabulous. How you doing, darling? Well, of course, I'm not as sexy as you are. - Is he there? Hello? 914... What did Peter Sharp teach you? Oh, Peter Sharp was fabulous. He was instrumental in getting me recommended for the concierge job. The guy who trained me said about my stutter, he says, "Keep it." I said, "I can't"-- He said, "No, keep it, because it puts the person on the phone on your side because t-they don't want to offend a stutterer, and it gives you precious time to think and recover." Dwight is pro-- I think is the biggest-- one of the biggest assets of The Carlyle. The most sophisticated, intelligent man. The Carlyle would not be the same without him. People expect him here when they come. Dwight was really sort of the soul of the hotel. Walking in and seeing Dwight, it was like this big-- when we were young, almost like the big Santa Claus with the bear hugs, and he really represented warmth and old-world style in a way that others I don't think could reproduce. Dwight was just an institution, and he could get you any reservation in New York City. I got a call one night at home from a former colleague. He says, "They had somebody stuttering saying that they were y-you trying to get a table tonight for six people." And t-their response was, "Dwight doesn't stutter like that, who is this?" Have any guests ever commented about it? One. In all your 36 years, there's one? One refused to talk to me. Couldn't understand me. He didn't want t-to deal with me. If I answered the phone, he would hang up. And, um, he didn't come back. And the hotel didn't care. -No, unh-unh. - They wanted you over a guest-- Oh, yeah. It's-- How'd that make you feel? Well, I remembered my m-mother saying, "Son, you stutter. Some people will be offended by it. Some will laugh at you, and some will t-think you're retarded." She says, "But that's their problem, not your problem. You be the man you're going to be and just make sure that when it does come out, it's worth hearing." I spoke with Dwight. He's known people for 30 years. You know, I've known people since the 16 years that I've worked here who come back, and it's a family, and they come back because of that, because of the staff. Whether you've been here two years or 33 years or 50 years, which is the case for some of my colleagues, I just know that this hotel is so much bigger than all of us. You know, I had a guest who stays here for as long as I've worked here, who I've known since the beginning, and he put it the best. He said, "You know, we're an old hotel. We do have problems," but he said, you know, "There's a certain patina that we have that no other hotel has, no other hotels." And that's the truth. I mean, the staff in this hotel. Let's just face it, the doormen, the bellmen, the housekeepers, I mean, they're like my family. We have the same people here for decades. You really want these people to be sitting on your bed and chatting to you about, you know, "Ah, this guy doesn't know what he's doing," or, "This person doesn't what--" and it's the same characters. I'm still a rookie at the concierge desk. If we have the other concierges, seven years is kind of nothing here. I mean, having all the other people from 40 years, 30 years, 20 years, and me only seven years. But hopefully, I can retire here. That would be my wish. Give us a verse, one verse. Is it all right if we do it here? Yeah. Go for it, What do you want? Whatever your-- whatever sweet spot is. Okay. Let's see. D-- no, I don't want to do that one. It is the atmosphere. And this has nothing to do with money. Atmosphere has been made by the human factor. And the human factor in this hotel is so important. What's the most unusual request that has come down? I would say-- I always remember this. A woman had a cute little dog who-- she didn't want to take it out to do its business, and we said, "Well, can we get you wee-wee pads?" "No, he has to have grass." So, I had to order sod, a square of like grass, sod, and have it put in the room for the week and a half while they were here. Did they have a pooper-scooper or something? I guess. I mean, I don't know about that. Maybe she left it for housekeeping to clean up after. Woody Allen likes to sit in the back when he comes. Some people want to be in the middle. Politicians and leaders want to be in the back away from people, especially presidents of countries and so forth. What do they call you here? -Captain. -You're the captain. Yeah. It's a great, great title. -Yeah, yeah. - I love that. So, there's captains all over the city. -No, there's not anymore. - Really, so this is a rare-- It's kind of, yeah, we're kind of a dying breed. Do you know anything about JFK, Jr.? - Yes. - He used to come here. All the time. Tell us about him a little. He used to come and sit on table 29 with rollerblades. What do you mean rollerblades? He used to rollerblade around New York City. He'd come here with them on? He used to come in at like 2:30, 3:00 a couple times a week 'cause his mother lived around the corner. He used to bring all the ladies in? No, there were no ladies. Rollerblades. Breakfast-- his last breakfast was here? - Yes, right here. - Right here. -It was a weekend. - It was a weekend. And he took a plane that day to go to Martha's Vineyard. Yes, just before. - I liked his mother. - Oh, you did? She was the nicest person I ever met. She used to come in. All the time. Twice a week. She was the nicest person you've ever met? Yes. Just came and sat on table ten all the time. - Table ten. - Table ten. She remembered our names and she came and had the same thing every day. -What did she have? - Her Cobb salad and a drink and a cigarette. Back then, you could smoke. What was her drink of choice? I think it was gin and tonic. So, you're on camera telling us this? -Yes. - But you're not supposed to say. -So, does this feel-- -Well, I mean, you know, I think it's a 15-year thing -or a 20 years ago. - There's a rule. -Yeah, yeah. John F. Kennedy made The Carlyle what it is today. We had come from the 1950s. When Eisenhower left office, Eisenhower was 70 years old. John Kennedy was 43, and he had a beautiful wife who was wonderful to look at. Many things come when someone dies young. We have the same fascination with John Kennedy and Camelot. He was an important figure at a very important time, and he was also very glamorous. And so, of course, he'd stay here. You know, where else would he stay? I saw him here when I came here in '63. I was very young. I was about 17. I was working in the other department in the package room, and he was coming into the hotel, and we were peeking through the side door. We saw him coming in with the entourage and everything else, and across the street at the time, there were just brownstones there, so you had the cops sitting on top of the buildings, and it was actually quite a scene. I was really impressed. - So, you've been here ever since? -Yes, ever since. This was Jack Kennedy's birthday party at Madison Square Garden. Whoever paid $1,000 got to have dinner, and the President would come around and shake your hand. I never met Marilyn Monroe. I was never in her presence. I know that on one occasion, she was in New York. They were there at the same time together, you know, but other than that, I don't know of anything that transpired between the two of them. There's photos of Kennedy coming and going. There were some... secret back entrances that they would use. I asked my stepmother specifically if the press were all over The Carlyle hotel, why didn't they pick up on it, and she, without skipping a beat, said, "What good would it do the country?" You have to ask Danny, the bellman. - Danny, the bellman? -Danny, the bellman. I heard Marilyn Monroe used to come in through a tunnel here, is that true? I heard that, too, in fact, when I came here in '63. I've never seen the tunnel. I've never seen Marilyn Monroe. 51 years later, I'm still looking for the tunnel, and I can't find it. Most people would say that's very unusual for a man to do the same job for 54 years. What keeps you in this position? Oh, aside from loving the place and loving the people and people like you and all the other people, -it's cozy enough here. - You're a creature of habit as well. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely, yeah. That's what I tell my wife. "You're lucky I don't like change." It's that degree of longevity. People like Danny the bellman, who had been here for what, 50 years or more. They're part of the culture of this place. No one could have told me back in the early 1980s that I would break the record for staying at this hotel as a guest more times than any other guest, and I wear that as a badge of honor, I might say. I think as of today, it's something approaching 1,100 overnight stays. I don't think there's anybody even close. If this was a TV show, what would it be, a drama or a comedy? It would be, uh... both. A combination, you know? Why? What's so funny about it? What's so funny about this place? Um... The funny thing about this place is that it's an old hotel. Everybody keeps complaining about how old it is, but they all keep coming back. I think it's funny. What year did he walk in? Do you remember? I don't remember, 20 years ago. 20 years ago? Who walked in? Who was it? -You know. Our-- - Our what? Our famous president, Donald Trump. Okay, so he walks in. How did you overhear what he was saying about the hotel? He was on the second floor. There was a party on the second floor, and one of the waiters said on the second floor that Donald Trump said this was one of the most prestigious hotels he's ever walked in. I mean, that he's ever-- that's he's ever visited. But then what did he say about it after he got a really good look at the place? He said, "I confirm my belief." What did he say?! Come on, come on, Danny! Tell the truth! What did he really say? Tell the truth. I shouldn't talk about it. What did he say? What'd he say? He said, "This place is a joke." How's that? Check it out. Just whip around right here. -See that smile? He knows. - Danny. He knows. -Do you agree with that? -I've been here a lot of times. I like it more all the time. Place is a joke. -This place is a joke. Ridiculous. I mean, you look-- just look anyone in the eye, anyone that works here, look them in the eye. it's a joke. Yeah, there's not one person here that isn't slightly embarrassed and guilty of working here. He knows. This place is a joke. Why do you think they got this kind of door here? Start it over. Tell that one again. I've heard it before. Tell it again. You know those people who tell you the same joke every single time you see them? This place is a joke. What brought you there the first time? Um... Or whobrought you there, maybe. Well, uh... who brought me there was a boyfriend. - No way. - Yes! Not your husband. I don't want to say this! A boyfriend brought me there. Yes. I thought, wow, this is like being in Europe, but I'm not in Europe. I'm in New York, and this is, like, that old glamour. I'm sitting in the upper gallery of the hotel's living room which is called the Little House, and it was designed in 1989 by legendary Italian decorator Renzo Mongiardino, and it is in his classic style. Killen cloths all over the couches, wallpaper by Enrico Brus, who's an Italian designer, and it is-- for people who are fans or who studied Renzo Mongiardino, he's done some of the most classic interiors, from Elsa Peretti to the Agnellis' in Italy, and so having a piece of him in New York makes this room a room to remember. That corner banquette is-- is-- is-- basically was invented for you to have an affair. - Have you had an affair? -No, I have not. Maybe. Most of the people, when they walk in, they get shocked when they see. It's like you when you see a girl of 20 years and beautiful good-looking. One of the kings of Turkey, he had discussion for the same decoration. I would bring it over to The Carlyle. I mean, it has a unique, unique heritage. As a native New Yorker, there's really nothing that is more emblematic of elegance, history, romance, scandal than The Carlyle. In the first Gulf War, the Iraqi delegation to the UN was staying here, and of course, the FBI said, "We want to come in. We want to put people in room service. We want to tap the phones." You know, generally just be a presence here. My dad said, "Under no circumstances. These are our guests. These are my guests. And they have their privacy. I wouldn't let you do it to Warren Beatty. Why would I let you do it to the Iraqi delegation?" The Carlyle way is The Carlyle way, Peter Sharp is the person who made The Carlyle what it is today, and what's it's been in the last few years, and I think we all need to be grateful for what he has done because he did more than put The Carlyle on the map. I think he made it his grand dame. It was his private home, in a way. The Sharp family was from a real estate and a landmark point of view. I mean, they were part of the history of New York City. That's true, my gr-- I guess that would be, what, my-- four greats, I guess, was John Roebling. Peter was in this business for a long time. His parents owned several hotels. That's what they did, and Peter, even in his time off from school, he had to go work at the hotels. There was definitely competition between my father and my grandmother. My dad recognized that there was a need at that time that people who were coming to New York that were socially connected as well as connected in business didn't want to stay down at the St. Regis. They didn't want to stay at The Plaza, which was a zoo. They were usually here for relatively longer periods of time, and they wanted to stay where their friends lived. And so The Carlyle really became that second home. How did he run this place? -because we've heard various stories about-- -With the most-- With the most personal touch. I mean, he worried about every bud vase. He worried about the menu. He... didn't have to, but he did. I think it was his baby. There was also a feeling of-- of an esprit de corps here, of a single person owning the hotel as opposed to this being a corporate entity. Peter Sharp lived on Park Avenue, maybe a few blocks away, and he would go jogging in the park every day, and he'd come down and work room service for breakfast. He was making sure that the orders got delivered within 15 minutes. And that eye, I did learn that, the ability to walk into a room, and it's almost, you know, Conan Doyle-ish in a sense of being able to pick out 15 things that are wrong with a room just like that. And my dad could do that in spades, and he would say things-- and this was imbued into us-- is even though the guest doesn't see it, they see it. Do we have any extra flowers we can put one in this room? Yeah. It's Mr. Beretta's VIP guest. A great vote of thanks to the way The Carlyle transitioned from being an uptown hotel to being the socially in-place has got to go to my dad's really great friend, who's Ahmet Erdogan. It was Ahmet that said, "You gotta hire Bobby." I've been coming to The Carlyle since I was... about three, four-years-old. I grew up blocks away from here. I grew up 5 East 82nd Street, and my parents were very close with Bobby Short. I was brought to this room as a small child, made to put on a suit which I didn't like. As I remember, it was very itchy, and I used to sit in this room and listen to Bobby Short. As a kid, you know, by the time I was, like, five, seven, eight... I didn't really get it, and, you know, you're in a roomful of adults. It's quiet. It's dark. And you know, Bobby's playing, you know, Duke Ellington and Rodgers & Hart and Gershwin and so forth. But one day, I got it. I understood it, and I fell in love with Bobby and this room. Bobby, who was born in 1924, came and he started playing when he was 8-years-old on the road, couldn't read music, and he knew 6,000 songs, the lyrics and the music. And the great jazz people of the world like Fats Waller and Earl "Fatha" Hines and Louis Armstrong all knew the little boy and took him under their wing and taught him. A child prodigy since age 12 touring and performing and traveling and singing, so he grew up with this music, just every fabric of his being. Class. Classy, classy, classy. Just totally relaxed. To-tal-ly relaxed. And a brilliant performer. Brilliant performer. He was the hippest of the hip, the most continental of continental entertainers and jet setters. Bobby presented his knowledge to the audience so freely and not expecting them to know. So, he kind of just left room for you to say, "Okay, well, I don't know this era, but thank you, because you are making me understand what it is." Always impeccably dressed with a very erudite style and an appreciation of Cole Porter and Noel Coward and the most witty of songsters who has ever entertained an upper-crust cosmopolitan New York set. I'd never heard of him until I saw Hannah and Her Sisters, and I loved him in it. I'm a Woody Allen fanatic. I love all his movies, and I had seen Café Carlyle and Hannah and Her Sisters, and when Dianne Wiest is like snorting a third nostril into her face, I just thought it was the most amazing juxtaposition because you have the piano keys going, and then she's just coked out of her mind, and Woody Allen's suicidal, and it's just fabulous. And I thought to myself, "Self, I've got to go there." I saw them arrive, and it was an amazing moment because, you know, New Yorkers in particular pretend to be very sanguine about the royals until they're actually near them, and then, like everybody else, they go completely bonkers. It is a very brisk, cold, bitter night here. December in New York. Kate looking beautiful in a burgundy jacket. William sans coat, notably, but The Carlyle hotel, no stranger to receiving royalty. The Duke and Duchess, I think, definitely stayed here at The Carlyle because Princess Diana used to stay here, and she was very fond of this hotel, and I know they had heard about it. I heard him say that in the lobby, that he heard so much about this hotel through the years and they were really happy to be here. They need to stay in a place that's really going to capture the essence of the city in which they're at. That is really important to us because this was their first ever visit to New York. Oh, that was huge. I mean, it was huge. It was in every single newspaper and magazine and website, TV show, I mean, all around the world. Oh, they kind of told me where they wanted me to be. They asked me if I could try to stop them for a second so the photographers could take a lot of pictures. It was actually a cool moment. I was totally blinded. Thank you. Giovanni. How you doing? Nice to see you. -Good to see you. -Nice to be back. Thank you, thank you. How was the flight? -Good. -You sure? -I'm used to it. -I see you unshaven for once. It's okay. It's okay. This is one of the cases where we're very, very fortunate to have Roger liking this hotel so much, and he makes this hotel his base for him and his family when they're in New York. Roger Federer is Mr. Beretta's god. -It's his hero. -Roger Federer is the greatest tennis player that has ever lived. All good? Yeah, yeah. Of course, of course. It would be better if you win. Yes, of course. That would be always nice. We would be awfully upset here if you don't. That gives me three weeks to stay here. -Excuse me. -Thank you. Please. Okay, so, as I told you earlier, anything, anything that you need. A lot of stuff should already be in place, -but anything else. -Thanks for everything, Giovanni. I'm looking forward to hopefully three weeks. Yes. It's gonna be three weeks. I'm looking forward to the final. -Thank you, Roger. Ciao. -See you later. Ciao, ciao. -Bye-bye. -Bye. Total man crush. I want to tell you one thing, my complete confession. Oh, and-- and pl-- everyone must make a vow of secrecy to this. On Tuesday night, I went outside this hotel by the main doors with two dancers and a magnum of champagne naked and we took a picture. And we just went downstairs, and we just did it, and nobody knew, nobody caught it. So, your album cover is-- you took it outside of The Carlyle. -Yeah. -This was not planned, right? So, we have the Post-Its because-- Not only are you fully-- I am-- And that's not a magnum, you know, that's-- I checked with the censors. I am allowed to do that. So there you go. Wait. That's a great shot. We only had one shot at it, but it wasn't like there was people walking by me. There was nobody there. It was kind of like 3:00 in the morning, 2:00 in the morning. Anyway, these two dancers, Raymond and Lisa, came over, and we did it. I am a little drunk, and we went down and we sort of to practiced with our clothes on, and the security man from The Carlyle came out, and I said, "I'm just saying good-bye to my friends," lie. Because you had no permission to do this. -Zero. And, uh-- -Okay. But it was quite scary, like, someone could've come out any second, and then because I'd done that photo, when I was coming to do the live version of my show, I went back to The Carlyle purely to have that photo on the cover of the album. Isn't that nuts? It's a bit bad to want to do an album purely because you've got the photo for the cover first. Normally the music comes first, but... I'd like to think that when this came out, they called that security guard into the office, and the manager said, "Hey, Gary? Could you explain how this happened?" Anyway, with our new freedom to travel wherever we like, given by our good friend, President Carter, I thought I'd sing this song because it comes to mind instantly. It goes something like this. We were very, very close friends, and he always had that wonderful raspy voice, and he said, "How you doin', sugar?" With his accent, you know, and I just melted. I was so happy when he invited me to be present when he received the Madison Avenue and 76th Street corner that's called the Bobby Short Corner. That was his nickname, the King of The Carlyle. You know, he really deserved a street named after him. An 80th birthday party was held for him, and I remember Bobby Short clear as day sing It's Glamorous. And I said that is the way to live. There-- you know, there's the way to live. Turning 80? Yes, it's glamorous. Oh, people still talk about it. The bartenders talk about it. "When Mr. Short was here, we were three deep at the bar. They did three shows, they did a 1:00 set." It's amazing. I mean, a different world. I mean, jammed. I mean, New York was a different place. As I hit the keys and think about Bobby Short's personality, it does sort of come together and make a lot of sense, and I'm told that he required a brand-new Baldwin piano every time he'd play at the beginning of every season. It's marvelous. What happened when Bobby passed away? What was the reaction here? How did it happen? Was it slow, or was it sudden? It was very sudden. He was scheduled to-- to be performing in the Café. I think this was March or May of 2005. And it was just a shock. Nobody expected that at all. I was asked by Christie's to come and play his piano for the last time before it was auctioned off. So, here, I'm sitting at Christie's, amongst all of his artifacts. And I was sitting right in the middle of it playing Bobby's Bechstein for the last time. I think it sold for 150 grand. Yeah. I know the woman who bought his books. She bought the books for five grand. It was called "a lot." Just "a lot of books." How do you empty out Bobby Short's apartment and not check the books? People, the movers, I don't know, walked in there. 20 boxes of books. That was the lot. And that was sold as is. Five thousand. Nobody checked. She had a call two weeks after the auction from Sotheby's, someone offering her $1.5 million for the books. She hadn't even opened them, and she said, "I don't need the money"-- and she really doesn't-- and kept the books and then started looking. There are original letters from Cole Porter in there. There are lover letters. There is a Bobby Short... life in these 20 boxes. This is how he said it, and he's right. He says, "I'm no big star. I'm a star in this town. So, from the time the plane lands and until the planes take me back to France, I know it's the Bobby Short Carlyle show, and s-so I'm always on my best behavior." But he would never d-do anything to make either one of those shows look bad 'c-cause he knew that that room made him, and he made that room. I only came here now as if in a dream, I'm remembering, some ten years ago, to see Woody Allen. and I sat, as I remember, back there at the bar and just saw him. No, I've seen Woody play three times, I think. It's amusing. I like to see that. Why is it funny? Oh, he's so sincere about his clarinet. Café Carlyle, Bobby Short-- -Oh! -Woody Allen-- -Woody Allen's there every Monday. -Eartha Kitt. -Eartha Kitt was there, really? -Yes. Wasn't she good? Yeah. No, I'm thrilled and honored to be there with a great band. How about that? That's humbling. I heard that. I would usually stand in the back whenever I would watch my mother perform, and she felt it was a family. So, when she would come here, it was like being home. It's true. I'm being asked constantly, excuse me, what kind of songs and music influenced me as I was growing up? But I've never grown up, and I have no intentions of ever doing so. When you're in a room like that, the Café Carlyle, you expect some kind of envelope to be pushed. You feel like it's not gonna go much further than those four walls. We're at my favorite song. This is my favorite song about one of my favorite subjects in the world-- penises. I just like them. I do. I like them. I love the Café. I lovethe Café. Can you believe that that's still happening? I can. I-- I'll be there... I'll be there tonight. It's a magical room. And the drinks are good. I think we're looking at a Vertès fantasy. We're looking at circus performers. We're looking at musicians. We're looking at ballet. And I think they've become symbolic of this space in the same way that you enter Bemelmans' world, here you're entering the world of Marcel Vertès. Now with the patina of time, they've slightly faded and bled into the walls, in a way. They've become part of the fabric of the building, and that makes them even more attractive. I love you! Herb Alpert right there! -Go see him at The Carlyle! Here in New York City! There's a real artistic feeling in that room. You know, it just feels-- it's chummy. It feels cozy. And you know, so many great artists have performed on that stage, you feel that energy. So, it's-- I'm always looking forward to it, and so is Lani. And certain songs just seem to melt into the room. It feels kind of like an old movie. Like what's the film? All About Eve. Where she comes in and the dressing room is this large, grand room with all these windows. But The Carlyle is this fancy thing where someone brings in your dressing gown and they bring in your dinner, and you get ready for your show. You walk into the elevator, you walk out of it and walk into the room. You don't have to do Cole Porter in order to engage the audience here. As long as you as the performer are engaged in the song, the people come along the journey with you. You walk through the people, and you touch their shoulders as you're going to the stage, and the music's playing. There's a breeze, and you feel like you're in this very important place, and you step up and you try not to look at who's there. It's magical. I wanted to talk about what I had done in New York City the previous night, and this came in so handy. And now he's in The Carlyle. Café Carlyle. Hmmm, The Carlyle. Which is a small cabaret room. -Yes. -So, you can imagine his voice. I mean, the people who are residing on the 15th floor of the hotel must be shaking up there. I remember the first night I played here, I took over for Bobby Short, first night, and George Steinbrenner sat, like, right there. The first guy to stand up was him, and of course, that's pretty cool. I mean, when they saw the boss stand up, and half the place stood up right way, you know? So, I got a standing ovation. Well, I think it's really as varied a crowd as you get anywhere because you get some people for the music, some people because they know the reputation of the room and they come back year after year after year, you get millionaires, billionaires who are sitting and you don't even know who they are sometimes, and then you find out who they are or they talk to you at the bar and you go, "Oh, you own thatbuilding." Everything in New York you could do on the spur of the moment. Like maybe, "Let's go see Bobby at the Café Carlyle." Just the way you used to be able to say, "You know, I have a half-hour. I'm going to the Museum of Modern Art." You can't do that now, you know. There's lines. There's a zillion people. So, all of the treasures of New York that were the reason that you lived in New York and put up with all the things that are not great about New York, now, you know, there's a billion people from Kansas ahead of you in line, and even if you can make a phone call and get ahead of that line, you're going to be in there with a billion people from Kansas. I never dreamed that I would ever get to perform here. So, when I was asked to, I was kind of blown away by it. It's definitely a fantasy of mine to-- to be on this stage and to grace this-- this great institution. Not yet. It's not time. It's not time. But-- but it'll happen. You know, a lot of places, you could arrive at and think, well, it would be better if this place was more like this or like that or the other thing, but I think at The Carlyle, you're more like, okay, this is just good, the way I would want it to be. It's fabulous! For the people in the front row, I can hear what they're saying, and thank God nobody said, "She sucks. Oh, that was off" Because I think-- I think that would really throw me 'cause I am sensitive. You come to the Café Carlyle and see a show, it's going to be a sane evening. You know what I mean by that? Not insanity. Not loud, crazy, out of control, an evening of substance and joy and fun. And a little naughty. What the . - Especially if you're on stage. -You're [bleep] right. It's like, you know, Yankee Stadium. It's not there anymore. If this place goes dark, then there's no more New York City. Good night and thank you. That's it. That's all there is. Broadway legend Elaine Stritch was 89 when she died today at her home in Michigan. Her career spanned more than 70 years including film, television, and cabaret shows. Bobby Short blacked us out. -It was going so well. - I know! Later that day, that morning, we heard Elaine had passed. She was a big part of this place. It totally gives me the chills. I'm getting goosebumps. See, that's the kind of thing I kind of can understand. Like the energy. People's ener-- I'm not at all religious, but things like the energy that people have in the world and the soft of the-- that somehow something would have rocketed across the-- through the ions and the protons and everything and it would have affected this room, where so much of an energy is, I completely buy into that. Oh, my goodness, I love to think that that was the ghost of Elaine. Tsk, awe. There are some nights I remember that when it snows-- and the Upper East Side is quiet at night, but then when it snows, there's that lack of echo, and it's-- there's nothing going on. And sometimes you're so used to hearing traffic that you can't really sleep without some noise. So, there have been nights where I've been up at 3:00 in the morning and I'd go to the window, open it to-- I like-- you know, to feel that snow coming in. I always used to look out... to Elaine Stritch's corner room. She always had a light on, and-- almost like the light they put on stage when-- the ghost light, I think they call it, and I never felt alone in New York knowing that she was in that room. Yes, I need-- let's try F&B, please. I'm gonna miss talking to you. Well, thank you very much. Okay, good-bye, y'all. That was Tommy Lee Jones and his wife calling from the ranch. Actually, Dwight, we're members of the Santa Fe opera, and we have a house not far from the opera house in Santa Fe, and Dwight was a pretty well-informed opera fan. So, we invited him out to go to a few operas just before he retired, and he had a great time. He was awfully good company. I'm going to miss seeing my colleagues every day. -Mmm. Don't make me cry now. -All right. I'll change. Why did you know it was time? Good afternoon. This is Stephanie. -How may I assist you? - The stresses are-- are different. The world is less genteel. And it's really... not a world I care to be a part of in this position anymore. The things we lost, I think, were-- a lot of society lost its sense of... dignity. If you watch newsreels and people from the '40s and '50s, it's amazing to go to baseball to see footage of baseball games or people at-- everywhere in America. Ordinary people. They had hats on. They had jackets on. They had a sense of dignity and purpose in their lives, and they looked like solid c-citizens. But... we all look like messengers now. I don't care what they said, with the costumes comes a mentality, and o-- and once you toss out that, you've lost something that's very... ineffable. Well, you know, everybody changes. Nobody's the same down through the years, we all change. You're the constant. You haven't changed. Well, I don't know about that. People that saw me 25 years ago would think differently. but you know-- How long have you been here? I've been here ten months. Ten months only. What was your first impression? I loved it. - Really? -Absolutely. So, when you arrived here, you were like, "I won't change a thing. It's perfect"? - I guess not. -I take the Fifth. I grew up in Oklahoma. I wasn't singing on big stages. I was singing in people's living rooms. So, I knew that being at the Café Carlyle was going to feel like this small, intimate space where you can reach out and touch the people, and they hear it in a different way. And then so I chose to sing this song called, Make Someone Happy, which everyone knows, but I don't think people listen to it enough. The lyric is "Fame, if you win it, comes and goes in a minute. Where's the real stuff in life to cling to? Love is the answer. Someone to love is the answer. And make them happy, and then you'll be happy, too." So, I would finish my set with that song and that story, and the reason for that is that intimate thing. The audience there I think really loves that kind of thing because we go back to a time when things were simpler and things were more real, maybe, a little bit. More face to face. More human. And I'll always go and have me some of that if you're offering. Absolutely. I don't know whether profit comes first here. You know? There's a-- there's an eccentricity. There is an identity. There is a tradition here that must be served. And I think they're aware of that. They're not screwing things up by changing them. It is a weird-- and when I say "dysfunctional," what I mean by "dysfunctional" is that it could be a lot more cold-blooded. They could probably be making a lot more money if they were appealing for a wider, more middle ground. A certain type of people like this place. What exists here is the best of what we once were, but in an updated way. Look, I would say if you were going to ask me any place in the world that I've stayed, and I've stayed in a lot of great places in the world, nothing I've ever stayed to compares to this, the way you're treated. This isn't just a place that you come and lay your head. This is a glamorous place. I mean, I have a real-estate boner just sitting here. I mean, there's probably been some lucky hookers in here. Jack Nicholson. Where did Jack sit? Oh, he's table three in the back. Table three in the back. Did he give you an orchid? No, he gave me a tip. "The Lakers. Bet the Lakers," he said. -The Lakers were playing. - And did you? Yeah, I did. I actually did. I'm not exhausted. I'm exhilarated. You're a provocateur. You're a negative provocateur. There's nothing wrong with that. No, I feel-- don't I seem-- I don't seem tired. I-- I'm on it. I'm in the zone. And this entire room was a closet. I'm not kidding. It was a closet. And it wasn't my clothes. I want to be very clear. No, I can't stay here. What? Here? You mean the-- this room is blocked off for the night? What time-- what time do I have to be out of here? Just one free room for all this time? Okay. I'm bored now. Thank you, sir, thank you. You know, I heard that-- I was informed by the hotel that they're going to put a plaque up on your room. Oh, my God! You're kidding me! No, I'm not. Oh! That's a thrill. If that's true... wow. That's so-- such a compliment, I can't tell you. I don't know what the problem was 'cause nobody ever knocked on it, but it's up to them. Sometimes when people that are friendly, when they're leaving, and they're getting ready to check out, they'll say, "I'm checking out," and I'll go... What was the most unusual request you were ever asked? Wow, the most unusual. To find a pig that Tom Cruise ordered for-- -was it Reiner? - Rob Reiner? Yes. As a surprise. Dress the pig up. and we had a time getting it from customs. -You mean like live? No, it was a cooked pig with glasses, tuxedo hat. It was dressed up, you know. It was just like, "A pig? Dressed up?"
