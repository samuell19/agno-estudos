(FRENCH ACCORDION MUSIC PLAYS) (SPEAKS FRENCH) (SPEAKS FRENCH) (MAN SPEAKS FRENCH) (IN FRENCH) S'il vous plaÎt, monsieur. Anything else, Mummy? Don't forget, Joss, the hotel is Les Oeillets. - Tell the porter, he'll...know where. - Yes, Mummy. (CRIES) Don't let Mummy see you cry. (GUARD BLOWS WHISTLE) (AMBULANCE ENGINE STARTS UP) Come on, Vicky. We'll soon be at the hotel. (SPEAKS FRENCH) Hm? - Hotel Les Oeillets. - (SPEAKS FRENCH) I suppose we're walking. (RINGS BELL) (SPEAKS FRENCH) (BOTH SPEAK FRENCH) Vicky, you shouldn't have, not until you've asked. I'm sorry, Hester, but I love greengages. Madame Corbet! Madame Corbet! (BELL RINGS) (JOSS) Good evening, our name is Grey. We have reservations. (SPEAKS FRENCH) - What did she say? - Something about children alone. She say no kids. No kids in hotel. I suppose they don't take children by themselves. But if we are by ourselves... Madame... Notre mère is sick. (BOTH SPEAK FRENCH) Madame Corbet only manage hotel. The mademoiselle is boss. - Where is she? - She prepare to go out with Mr Eliot. What are we going to do? (SPEAKS FRENCH) Go and see cops. Come on. There's bound to be a hotel somewhere. Hester, can you help with the cases? Willmouse can you manage Vicky's? - You can leave the baggage. - You speak English? But naturally I speak English, when I wish to. - Leave the bags. They will be safe. - No, thank you. Hello, what's all this about? Great heavens, an orphanage! - We're not orphans! - We have a mother and a father. - And Uncle William. - Our mother's in the hospital. - She was bitten by fly. - We did have reservations. - It's not our fault mother was ill. - Stop! - What are they doing here? - Their mother holds four reservations. You have no right to make reservations without consulting me. Those were my orders. Where's the mother? She became ill on the way. She's in the hospital. Anyway, we're leaving, so it really doesn't matter. - Where are you going? - To the police. - Police? Why? - Because of you French. - I'm not French. - Oh. - Where's your father? - In the Himalayas. - What is he doing there? - Picking flowers. - Picking flowers? - He's a botanist. Bo-ta-nist. And he's on an expedition. Have you no relatives? - There's Uncle William. - Mother wouldn't want him to know. - He'd say I told you so. - What are we to do? I told them, they must go. - But they did book their rooms? - Accompanied by their mother. - It's not their fault their mother is ill. - It's not mine. Oh, come on Zizi, you're not that hard-hearted. Look at them. They're tired and hungry. - You can't throw them onto the streets. - Don't bother about us. - Come on, children. - No. They're staying the night. I insist. Well, all right. So you change your mind. Come this way, children. - I didn't know you liked children. - I don't know any. (CORBET) Your passports, please. That one's mine, the children are on mother's. Next year mother has told me I can have my own. I'm not interested in next year. Put them on the top floor and take their baggage. What are you waiting for? I'm not nursemaid. I don't take care of kids. You needn't worry. We can look after ourselves. Ça va, I take it. (LAUGHS) When you came that first night and signed the register, you put your address as the River Marne. It was the only address I had. - But nobody lives on a river. - The Chinese do, millions of them. - So now you're Chinese? - Only on my mother's side. (CHUCKLES) I've known you, how long, two months and you tell me nothing. I've told you that at night your eyes are this colour. You drink and you forget. Eliot, what is it that you're trying to forget? I can't remember. Oh, no, don't joke. You are a mystery. One night you appear out of nowhere, and every week you go away. Where? I have no idea. You have women up and down the river. I keep them in lobster pots. And when you go to Paris, what do you do then? If I said I went to Paris on business, it would sound rather dull, wouldn't it? - So? - So I'll make it more romantic. Actually I'm a, sort of, Robin Hood. I steal from the rich and give to the poor. - What poor? - Myself, most of the time. - Oh, I've been poor for quite a bit. - Oh, darling, please be serious. How did you come here? So, out of the way? I saw your château from the river and it looked most inviting. So the river brought you to me. I hope it never takes you away. (CAR DOOR OPENS) (WHISPERS) Hurry. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (CAR ENGINE STARTS UP) - Zizi? - Why are you still up? I cannot sleep until you are home safe. It's ridiculous. I telephoned the hospital. The mother of the children is ill, really ill. She has a serious blood poisoning. - Will she get well? - They think so, but it'll take some time. - What about the children? - Uh, tomorrow. (DOOR CLOSES) Oh, still up, Claudette? (BOTH CHUCKLE) - Willmouse, it's morning! - Smashing! What's it like? (BIRDS CHIRPING) (HESTER) Oh, it's not like Bexhill-on-Sea. (WILLMOUSE) At least someone else is staying here. - He's an artist. Joss will be pleased. - Let's go and wake her. - Joss, get up. - Come on, get up, it's lovely, look. - Oh, don't, please. - You are not ill, too? - Did a bug bite you? - Silly, I'm not ill like Mummy. Is it...? - They can't send us away today. - I don't think they will. Not with that good-looking man on our side. What good-looking man? - The one who's friendly. - He was well dressed, must be rich. I didn't like the look of any of them. Go and get breakfast. - Shall I wake Vicky? - No, don't. Afterwards get them to phone the hospital. All right, Joss. (DOOR CLOSES) - I'm starving. What'll you ask for? - Petit dejeuner. - Petit? That means "little", doesn't it? - Yes. - Then just ask for "dejeuner" for me. - Oh, Willmouse. - (HESTER) Do you think anyone's up? - The French sleep late. - I wonder if we can find a maid. - (DOOR OPENS) - What're you doing here? - Joss wants us to get breakfast. - Joss? Who's Joss? - My sister. She's ill. (SIGHS) - I expect she's been eating too much. - You don't know Joss. I'll go and see how she is. Tell Mauricette to get you breakfast and Paul can bring it up. And next time, stay in your room. Don't come down here. Well, how's the young patient? Alive, I hope. My word, it's stuffy in here. (SIGHS) Yeah, that's better. Got a tummy ache? (SIGHS) Hmm. Let's take a look at you. - No fever. Probably nerves. - I'm quite all right. Madame Corbet rang the hospital last night. - Your mother will be fine. - I want to see her. You shall, but I'm afraid she won't be allowed visiters for a few days. - I hate this place. - I'm not surprised after last night. It's not too bad. - Why did you come here? - It's near the war cemeteries. - Visiting someone's grave? - No. No one in particular. - Then why? - It was mother's idea. She thought we were becoming selfish. We ought to see what people have given up in so many wars. Hmm. Your mother seems to be rather an unusual person. Is unselfishness so unusual? If there's anything you want, tell your sister. I'll see that you get it. A sick person is allowed to be little selfish. Leave those shutters open, fresh air will do you good. Just what the doctor ordered. (DOOR CLOSES) Work, work. All day and late night. C'est pas juste. And now I have to play nurse to these enfant trouves. - What's that? "Enfant trouves". - I think he means strays. Shh! Mademoiselle Zizi's room. She's asleep. But that's not her room, that's the gentleman's room. You are bats. I know Mademoiselle Zizi's room, don't you think? We saw the gentleman come out of there this morning. Didn't we Willmouse? He make a visit with her. Compri? He visit with her. - What? So early? - (CHUCKLES) You, you ignorante. Naive, little baby. - Huh, so, so... - Yeah, so! (SPEAKS FRENCH) (HESTER) Get off me. Stop it! Let go of me! Will you let go? Will you let go of me! Let go! (PAUL SPEAKS IN FRENCH) (GRUNTING) (SPEAKS FRENCH) Will you stop it! Do you hear me? Stop! (SPEAKS FRENCH) Eliot! Eliot! Stop them. All right. Stop it! Stop it now. Come on! Stop it! (SPEAKS FRENCH) (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Quiet everybody. QUIET! If you must fight, why don't you use the garden? Is that what they teach you in army camps? To fight with girls? - She hit me. - Get out of here. - Go to your room and stay there. - All right. Zizi, I'll deal with this. I'm sorry, but I lost my temper. That'll teach him not to tangle with the British. Let's have a look. You get soap and water on those scratches. - Thank you, monsieur. - Not monsieur, just Eliot. - Eliot. - Good. Mauricette, see that they get another breakfast. - Oui, monsieur. - Run along. Another breakfast. Just like that. Look at those broken dishes, who'll pay for them? - I've no doubt you'll put it on the bill. - How do I know they have money? - Might not be able to pay for the rooms. - If they can't I will. You have so much money, you can spend it on strangers? Oh, Zizi, how can you talk about money after last night? (TUTS) (DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES) Please, miss, smoke? Thank you. (COUGHS) Take a little puff, little. You'll learn. Oh, dear, I wonder if I ever will. (SPEAKS FRENCH) (SPEAKS FRENCH) (PAUL) Regarde. (HESTER) It's just a lorry. (PAUL) That's beautiful. - It's mine. - You own it? Soon. I save money, then goodbye Les Oeillets. Mademoiselle Zizi, lousy, Madame Corbet, lousy. - Job, lousy. - Why do you stay? No place else. - Where are your mother and father? - Disparus. Disappeared? But parents just don't disappear. Father soldier, American, take pretty French girl, give her cigarette, maybe... - That's not a nice word. - Nice, nice, nice. For you, everything nice. For me, not nice. What about Eliot? Why did he stay here? - He is a real mystery. - Yes, I suppose he is. Get on with your work. Your job's not to play with children. And you run off and stop wasting his time. Cow. - Why is she so excited? - Always. When Eliot returns home, she go nuts, nuts. - Does Mademoiselle Zizi love Eliot? - (CHUCKLES) Naturellement. - And does he love her? - He amuse himself. - Amuse himself? - Yeah. He make love. You'll learn soon, like cigarette. When I in love, first time, I 14 years of age. - Aren't you finished yet? - Finished. Then come in and help Mauricette. Crazy woman, always shouting. (MUMBLES IN FRENCH) Get on with the polishing. - Oh, Monsieur Eliot returns tonight. - I'll make something very special. - Mauricette, I told you fresh flowers. - Madame Corbet said they were good. Oh, she did. Well, I say they will not do. Claudette, I said fresh flowers. When I give an order, I don't want it interfered with. Because of him, the flowers are not good enough. If I let you go your way, he will ruin our business. Nonsense. We had over a hundred for lunch. Yes, we are becoming only a restaurant, a restaurant and a bar, but a hotel, no. - You always say we're full up. - I do not wish to have strangers. You run a hotel and you do not want strangers. - Please, try to understand. - I understand. This enormous place is just for him, his country house and you pretend to be his wife. But he will never marry you. Never. (MUFFLED VOICES) - What are they arguing about? - You dope. Eliot, always Eliot. - Why should they quarrel about him? - Madame Corbet detests Eliot. - But why? - You ask question all the time, question. No, Paul, why? Because Madame Corbet love Mademoiselle Zizi. - But Paul... - (SPEAKS FRENCH) You have so much to learn. You should've heard Madame Z and Madame C. - They were arguing like mad. - Don't bother me with that. I can't get Miss Dawn's dress to hang evenly. - Hester, Willmouse! - Joss, you're well. - I'm coming down to dinner. - Must we change? - Yes, we'll eat in the dining room. - She won't let us. - We'll see. Come and get ready. - Eliot is coming back from Paris. What of it? (SPEAKS FRENCH) - Bonsoir, Mademoiselle. - Bonsoir, Mademoiselle Oh, thank you, Claudette. They look very nice. I'm sorry about this afternoon, but you have hurt me. It's the last thing I wish to do. Come to your senses, Zizi. Tell him to go. I cannot. You're asking me to do the impossible. We were so happy before he came, so happy. (CAR HORN HONKS) (WILLMOUSE) There's Eliot! - (HESTER) Eliot! - Hello, hello, how are you? - We've been waiting ages. - (ELIOT) You look different. I know, you're clean. - We missed you very much. - Well done. - Written to your mother every day? - Yes. - Hello, darling. - You're late. I was worried. - How about me? A family man. - You look tired. I'll make you a drink. That's what I need. Travelling in Paris is awful. (BOTH SPEAK FRENCH) - Are you enjoying yourself? - Yes. - I want to hear all the local gossip. - Come and play with us, please. - Let me have one drink. - Come, children. Give Eliot peace. Well, I'll be back later. (BOTH SPEAK FRENCH) - Vodka, squeeze of lemon, - Aah! - Specially for you. - That's it. Treat the customers right, they'll always come back. Are you satisfied? Well, I've come back, haven't I? - (ELIOT CHUCKLES) - Do you think he likes her? He'd sooner be with us. Seven letters beginning with a W. Mademoiselle Zizi's hair isn't really red. - They make it red in the shop. - I know. - You know? - The first time I saw her, it was a little black at the roots. - How do you spell wicked? - W-I-C-K-E-D. - That's no good. - Her eyelashes take off. - I watched her do it. - She does that with her bosoms too. - Bosoms? Do you call them bosoms? - I saw them lying in her chair. - Are you sure that's what they were? - I've made bosoms for Miss Dawn. - Yeah, sumptious, isn't it? - Isn't it? - (MAN) Yes. - Excuse me. (MAN) Good evening. (CORBET) Good evening. We wanted to put up for the night if you've got a room. - Yes, that's right, ma'am. - For one night? Oh, yes, we can accommodate you. - Michelin's got you down for one star. - That's what it says, one star. - Mademoiselle de Presles, the owner. - Good evening. Nice little place you've got here. The château must be pretty old. Yes, very, very old. It has been in my family since 1700. (SCOFFS) 1700?! Mademoiselle Zizi's father, a butcher. - A butcher? - Yeah. He sell bad meat to soldiers, make big money, buy château. - Does he mean she tells lies? - And how. And here, you can see where the bullets hit the wall. Do you mean that's a real blood stain? My poor château. It has seen 10 wars and 4 revolutions. - You don't say! - My! Blood! I saw Paul painting it on. - Why does she say those things? - Paul says blood makes good business. (ELIOT) Well, Monsieur Dufour, How are things at the police? Oh, quiet. A small town like this, what can happen? - What, indeed? - You are staying a long time. - I like it here. - You don't miss your home? - I haven't one. Have a nut. - Oh, thank you. If you stay here permanently, it's necessary to obtain an identity card. - Yes, yes, I know that, yes. - Come to the gendarmerie. - I'll look after you. - Thank you. That's very nice of you. That young girl. She is ravishing. It's only Joss... The one who was ill. You must think we're a very unhealthy family. Not at all. As a matter of fact, I think you look good, very good. - All of you. - Thank you. Mademoiselle said dinner ready in kitchen. Inform mademoiselle we wish to eat in the dinning room tonight. - Ça alors. - You heard. Allez! I hope the children haven't been bothering you. We don't bother. They were very good before I went away. - I can only hope they haven't changed. - We never change. - Did you have a pleasant trip? - Oh, business trip. What is this about eating in the dinning room? Bonsoir, mademoiselle. Oh... - I had not understood. - Understood? That any of you was so...so big. We would like to eat in the dinning room tonight. I can't have my rules interfered with. You'll have to make an exception, because they're dinning with me. She was angry. Is it all right to break rules when you're grown up? That depends, Hester. If you're going to be sorry about it afterwards, no. How do you know when you're going to be sorry. Oh, that's a difficult question. I'm not sure that I know the answer. You'll have to ask your mother. Shall we go in? Thank you. The children have been longing to eat in the dinning room. Do a favour and see what happens! They take advantage. - I let them stay here out of kindness. - No, you did not. Face the truth. You took them in because he insisted. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) (ELIOT)..the poor artist didn't know what he was talking about. (HESTER) Joss is an artist too. (JOSS) It's just an ambition. If it is your ambition, you shouldn't deny yourself. - Get Mr Joubert to give you lessons. - I'd be delighted. Miss Joss, if you could come to the office, please. - You go up to bed. I'll be up in a minute. - Good night, Eliot. - Good night. Thank you very much. - Not at all. I heard what you were saying to the children. I must say your views on crime are revolutionary. I don't want you eating in the dining room. But why shouldn't we eat there? We are guests like the others. - My mother is paying for us. - I don't mix children with adults. I'm sure you've had children in the dining room. Do not argue with mademoiselle. Do what she says. - My mother wouldn't like it. - You are in our charge. Monsieur Eliot has been looking after us. Shall we ask him what he thinks? Monsieur Eliot shall be informed. Well, I have decided. You may have dinner with the guests, but I forbid you, absolutely forbid you to trouble Eliot. Do you understand? You be a good girl and go straight to sleep. - What did she want? - We're not to trouble Eliot. She wants him to herself. You wouldn't believe me when I told you what was going on. All the more reason not to get mixed up in it. I'm going to see him whether she wants me or not. - Different for you, you're just a child. - I'm only three years younger than you. You wouldn't understand. Anyway, he's taking us to see mother. I suppose there's no harm in going to the hospital with him. I like him...a lot. (CHURCH BELL CHIMES) Stay in the car. Be good. It'll be your turn next time. - Give our love to mummy. - All right. (SPEAKS FRENCH) Built in 1304 by Philip III, in honour of his queen. - Mother's in a hospital built for a queen! - No different from English hospitals. Show me an English hospital that was a monastery and built by a king. - For your mother. - Thank you. They're her favorites. Bonjour, madame. (BOTH SPEAK FRENCH) (BOTH SPEAK FRENCH) - Sister says your mother's much better. - (JOSS) Oh, good! Did you ever hear of an English hospital serving wine to the patients? The sister says you can only stay a few moments. Hello, Mummy. - Are you feeling better? - Yes, thank you, darling, a lot better. Hello Hester. You're all right? How are the littles? They're fine. They send their love. Eliot says they can come next time. - I've been worried about you. - You're not to worry, Mrs Grey. - This is Eliot. - How do you do? - Their letters are full of you. - I've done nothing. - You mustn't be a trouble to Mr Eliot. - They're no trouble. I assure you. You're very kind. This is their uncle's address, in case you should need it. Thank you. I'm sure that won't be necessary. I'm sorry, darlings. I hope I haven't spoiled your holiday. - Don't be silly - It's all right, Mrs Grey. I'll take care of them. Your mother wanted you to see a battlefield. That's one. (HESTER) It doesn't look like a battlefield. (ELIOT) Fifteen years can heal a lot of scars. The German position was on top of that hill. And we were advancing up the valley from Soissons. - We? You were there, Eliot? - Yeah. You were a soldier? I was a lot of things. - Dew of Joss. - Does it taste of salt? No, sugar and spice. She's being standing there for a very long time. - (WILLMOUSE) Why is she black? - You often see them like that in France. The first sacred statutes were carved from bog oak, which is black. I read that in the guide book. - Would she be as old as that? - Yes, she is very, very old. She's supposed to be able to work miracles. - I can believe that. - Her cloak is beautiful. Are those real rubies in her crown? Yes, they are real. Rubies and amethysts. - I want to see the rubies. - I'll lift you up. (VICKY) I wish I had a crown like that. (JOSS) We'll see the rose window. - What's the matter, Hester? - When you looked at Joss, I was jealous. - Were you now? - But it's wrong to be jealous. Oh, I wouldn't say that. I think I feel rather flattered. Joss, look at those ladies standing on the wall. They are saints. They are 700 years old. Joss says they are 700 years old. That's right. This façade was built in the second quarter of the 13th century. - (HESTER) Eliot. - Don't do that! (CAMERA CRASHES) I'm sorry, Hester. If it's broken, I'll buy you another one. But why didn't you want to have your picture taken? It's just a silly superstition, that's all. - You, superstitious? - Everybody's a bit superstitious. It's an old Tartar myth, handed down in our family. Every time your picture's taken, a little bit is chipped off yourself. But you are not a Tartar. - They didn't have cameras then. - Of course, I'm a Tartar. My ancestor is the great Genghis Khan. And he had everything, including a camera. The cameras weren't invented till the 19th century. - Oh, Willmouse. - Come on. Let's go down the river. Eliot, what do you do? Well, let's see now, oh, all sorts of things. - I know how we can find out. - Count his buttons. - Yeah! - Count his buttons! Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. - Thief! - He's a thief! Well, who'd thought it? Come along, you tykes, we haven't got all the day. (ELIOT) Last to the car has a face like a pig. (SHOUTING) - Bonjour, Monsieur Eliot. - Bonjour, Claude. (SPEAKS FRENCH) There's a café along the towpath called La Grande Nuit, wait there. - Are we going to eat there? - Why? You're hungry? - Yes. - Go on. I won't be long. - (VICKY) Eliot, we are thirsty. - All right, but soft drinks only. (CHILDREN LAUGH) - (ELIOT) Claude. - Ça va, Eliot? It's all so perfect. I wish we never had to go back to Bexhill-on-Sea. - I will live in France when I grow up. - So will I. - Or perhaps India or Baghdad. - Is Eliot a sailor? How could he be? He doesn't dress like one. - What's he doing on a barge? - Maybe ships things down the river. It's none of our business. - I like Eliot. - Who doesn't, silly! He's the only one besides mother who doesn't laugh 'cause I make clothes. - Do you mind? - Of course, I mind. - Eliot is a good man. Isn't he, Joss? - He's good to us. This is the first time I've eaten in a restaurant. We had dinner out with Uncle William once. That doesn't count. It was a tea room. - Here comes Eliot. - Let's play dumb. No one talk. - Oh, not that silly game. - Oh, Joss, don't spoil it. If you've finished your cocktails, we'll have dinner. Have you decided what to eat? - Mm-hmm. - How about this table, Monsieur Eliot? Splendid, but it seems that I'm the only one with an appetite. Oh! Then what would you eat, monsieur? I'd like to start with one of those delicious plump little melons, you know, nice and juicy. (PRIDEAUX) Nice and juicy, when you bite into them, oh! - And what to follow? - How's the steak? Oh, salad, beef steak... (SPEAKS FRENCH) I'll settle for that, make mine not too well done. - (SPEAKS FRENCH) - Oh, fried potatoes. - (SPEAKS FRENCH) - Crisp and golden and some petits pois. - And what about some strawberries? - Are they fresh? I picked them myself this morning. Strawberries it is, and a pot of your wonderful fresh cream. - But of course. - Bring the wine. - I want ginger ale. - One. - So do I. - (ELIOT) Two. - And me. - Three. - Me too. - Four! Be seated. Can we have what you ordered? The melon and everything? M. Prideaux, four young people have rediscovered their appetites. - Can you extend that order? - Certainly, monsieur. You're lucky. On Christmas, we had a taste of sherry. Hm. All right. I can take a hint. Pass your glasses, not all at once. As a matter of fact, a little wine is a good thing. - It loosens rusty tongues. - It was my fault. I thought it up. - No water for me. I'm not a child. - I know. It's these clothes, they're young, aren't they? - I rather like them. - Couldn't possibly. I'll tell you a secret that will make you happy. I like everything about you. - (IN UNISON) We want our dinner! - All right! All right! Keep it quiet! Let's play a game. You pretend you're all dumb and I'll... (CAR DOORS SHUT) Why did you not telephone? - (WHISPERS) Shh, don't wake the child. - Can't we have a drink together? I'll be back in a moment. See you at the bar. - 'Night, mademoiselle. - Good night. Good night. (JOSS) I never had such a lovely day in my life. He's interested in that young girl and there's nothing you can do about it. Oh, please! Now he's found an excuse to go to her room. - Hm, she's just a child. - Is she? Or does he see in her you when you were young? Leave me alone, I hate you. We'll be hearing from Vicky in about 17 hours. Eliot, I don't want this day to end. (DOOR CLOSES) - Monsieur Eliot, coffee up. - (ELIOT) All right, thanks. Put it down. (PAUL GROANS) - What're you doing? - Nothing, it was open. - It was shut and you opened it! - No. Don't lie to me! - Get out! - Please, monsieur, it is the first time. - And it'll be the last. - Please, don't... - Get out of here! - Please... - Morning, Monsieur Joubert. - Mademoiselle. - I've just started sketching. - That's very good. Joss? - Joss? They're going to sack Paul. - What about Paul? Eliot caught him going through his things. He told Madame Z and Madame C to get rid of him. Madame C refused, but Eliot insisted. It was quite a row. - I heard the whole thing. - But Hester... If Paul gets sacked, he won't get his lorry. - But what can we do? - Ask Eliot to give him another chance. - Joss, please, please. - Why should I? It's not our affair. Seems such a shame. I don't suppose Eliot would change his mind even if you asked him. - Wouldn't he? - He refused his darling Zizi, so I suppose he'd refuse you. That's all you know. - Why are you smiling? - Oh, nothing. - You're putting on lipstick. - Just a little. - Where is Eliot? - I saw him go to the orchard. Don't you worry about Paul. Did you drop from that tree? Maybe you're a nymph and live up there... a greengage nymph. Then I should grant you a wish, only it's the other way around. - Would you do me a favour? - What can a mortal do for a nymph? - Don't let them send Paul away. - You too? He has no home and money. His heart is set on that lorry. - Why are you so concerned? - He's good to Hester and the littles. I've never known a family like yours, all, sort of, glued together. You must have had one too. I had a mother and father. They weren't around much when I was small. And when I grew up, I wasn't around much myself. - That sounds so lonely. - I suppose it does. I'm used to it now. Do you like this place, Eliot? - It's as good as any other. - Anyway, you have someone here. I mean, not exactly a family but I mean... Look...you tell me about your life, that funny place you come from, what's it called? - Bexhill-on-Sea. - Yeah, Bexhill-on-Sea. I do what everyone else does, go to school and afterwards we play hockey. Hockey is all very well in its way. It really isn't living, is it? I wouldn't know. You know, I feel as if I've never really lived until I came here. - No? - Can't tell you all that's happened to me. I mean, inside of myself... since yesterday. At first I didn't even like you. Why not? The day I was ill, you came to see me and treated me like a child. - You're not exactly an old lady. - I am 16 and a half. - A half! - Another year and a half, I'll be 18. At 18 a girl is quite grown up. In some places, she can even vote. What will you vote for, Joss? For life. Does that sound silly? No. You have my vote too. I don't want to miss a thing. I want to travel, I want to paint. Most of all, I want to live...to feel... ..the way I felt last night. Greengage nymph, your wish is granted. My wish? Oh, my wish, thank you. On one condition, that you'll come out with me. - We'll go to the Champagne Caves. - I'll tell the others. No, just you and I alone. Go to the car. I'll fix it up about Paul and meet you. - They just appeared. - Listen, you tykes. I'll take you some other time, but not today. - Please, we won't be in the way. - We promise. We're going to the Champagne Caves, that's no place for children. I need to know about Champagne. - So must I. - So must I. We've to walk through the dark, what about Vicky? - I like the dark. - You won't like this place. How do you know? (SIGHS) One thing about the British, they certainly stick together. (HESTER) Oh, thank you. (WILLMOUSE) It's going to be super. - What's he doing that for? - Each bottle gets a twist everyday. - Why? - That brings the sediment to the cork. - Now, this is an art. - They don't seem to talk much. No, they like to keep quiet down here. Even a current of air could disturb the wine. - Can we see some more? - There is plenty more to see. Come on. Off we go. Along here. - How far do the cellars go? - About 10 miles. But you mustn't call them cellars, they call them caves in France. - 1947, what does that mean? - That's the year the wine was bottled. - I was born in 1947. - Then you are the same vintage. - Where's mine, Eliot? - Well, let's see now? Ah, what's this over here? Here we are. Château Vicky,1952. - Does it really say that? - Maybe I have changed it just a bit. - Where's yours, Eliot? - The caves don't back go that far. - Here's mine. Château Joss, 1945. - 1945. Ah, that was a great year. One of the best they ever had. - For champagne? - For everything. And the war ended. - Where were you? - In Germany. I was in something called the Special Services. - Sounds nice. - Yeah, nice word for a spy. A spy? Did you disguise yourself and pretend you were somebody else? I'll be a spy when I grow up. You'll have to learn how to lie, to steal, even how to kill. No, you stick to fashion, Willmouse, there's less wear and tear. (POPPING) - (VICKY) What's that? - My favourite music. Champagne corks. - Come on, Vicky! - Coming! (SPEAKS FRENCH) - Bonjour, monsieur. - Bonjour. - You have been through the caves? - Yes, indeed. - May I say you have a fine family. - Hey? Uh, oh, yes, well, actually they give me quite a lot of trouble. Would you care to take a glass of champagne with me. - Champagne for us too! - Would you like that? - Yes, please. - Can I taste a little? Just a little? - Come with me. - Right. (ELIOT) You gotta be careful of champagne, you get bubbles in the nose. (JOSS) I've never tasted champagne before. (ELIOT) Well, there's always a first time. - (MAN) Bonjour, monsieur. - Bonjour. - Another party for you? - This is a fishing club. Each year we give them a lunch. It has many famous members. - Such as? - Doctors, lawyers, even a bishop. Well, they like champagne. This year the guest of honour, is what you'd call a Sherlock Holmes, one of the greatest detectives in France, Renard. - Renard. - That means a fox, doesn't it? (MAN) Yes, indeed. There he is now, talking to those two priests. Monsieur le Directeur, you'll forgive me. - It's late, I have an appointment. - Just one glass. - It's not fair! - Another time, encore, merci. - You said we could have champagne. - (VICKY) But I never tasted champagne. - Thank you, monsieur. - It's a pleasure. (VICKY) You don't have to carry me. (BOTH SPEAK FRENCH) (VICKY) I wanted to feel the bubbles in my nose. (SPEAK FRENCH) - This is the road back to Vieux moutiers. - Yes. You said you had an appointment in Reims. I know. - Do you tell lies, Eliot? - Yes. I'm sorry, I had to do that. - Why did you? - Oh, I had a reason. - You wouldn't understand. - You didn't tell the truth! I tell lies, so do all of you! - For you to tell them is different. - I know what she means. - It's OK for you, but I must be perfect. - You're grown up! When you're grown up you'll always tell the truth? Haven't any of you tasted champagne before? - Don't be silly, how could we? - Today was the first time we saw it. It isn't as exciting as all that, once you get used to it. I suppose that sounds silly too. Eliot, what's made you so unhappy? Being perfectly happy for two days. - Good evening, M. Joubert. - (JOUBERT) Good evening. - What are those glasses for, Joss? - I don't know. (CORK POPS) (HESTER) Champagne! It must be for us. (JOSS) Can't be. - You're having a party. - (HESTER) It is for us! - Oh, from Eliot? - (VICKY) Bubbles! It bubbles! - (HESTER) Let's drink to Eliot. - Yes, to Eliot. - Will you have some? - Thank you. - Could I offer a little bit to M. Joubert? - Certainly. Ask him. Say, "Vous prendrez bien un verre, monsieur Joubert?" (SPEAKS FRENCH) (BOTH SPEAK FRENCH) (ELIOT) Well done. (IN FRENCH) Good health. Good health. Monsieur, you must wet the cork and touch it behind mademoiselle's ear. How silly of me. I forgot, voilà. - Is that lucky, Eliot? - Rather.... - Oh, do it to all of us. - Oh, do it to me. All right, you asked for it. (ALL LAUGH) (ZIZI) Eliot! Claudette says you ordered champagne for the children. - Well, I had a reason for it. - Are you mad? I know your reason. - Don't make scene, it's nothing. - You call it nothing? (SPEAKS FRENCH) (VICKY CRYING) Zizi, really! - Joss? - Leave me alone. (DOOR CLOSES) Oh, come on. Grow up! Don't be such a baby. (ELIOT) Zizi? Zizi? Zizi, I want to talk to you. - (ZIZI) Go away! - Come on. Open this door. - I do not apologise. - I'm not asking you to apologise. - You'll take her part. - I'm not talking anybody's part. It's stupid! She's only a child. Come on, darling. Be sensible. (CRYING) Two days, I've hardly seen you. You go out with her and I'm left here. - You are not jealous of a little girl! - First she was big girl. Big enough to have dinners with grown-ups. Then she's a little girl. Charming (!) - Zizi, they are only children. - Children. You think I am an idiot. To you they are not children. Not her, anyway. - I have seen you looking at her! - Not so loud. Oh, you are afraid someone might hear. She might hear. I don't care. I want her to hear. It's time she found out about you. - Zizi, I warn you... - You pretend to take care of her. You pretend to be her father. What you want is to make love to her. Maybe you have already. So...I came close, hmm? Look, what I have given up for you. The hotel is my living. You say, "No guests", no guests. Claudette thinks I have gone mad. Oh, Eliot, all this must stop. Send for that uncle to get them. I don't want you and them here. - Zizi, we need those children. - We? - All right. I need them. - Because of us? Exactly. You imagine our affair is a secret. Oh, no. I believe it has to do with your business in Paris. You can believe what you like. I think that the police might be interested. Zizi...is that a threat? Don't try and blackmail me. Don't try, that's all. Oh, I know, you could kill me. You are capable of it. No...you are much too attractive. I'm nothing anymore. I have no pride. I'm only a woman who loves you. It's all that is left of me. Joss, are you all right? I put the littles to bed. Shall we go? Can't. They have even kept our passports. Passports? Why do you want them? I want to go home. I can't travel without them. - What about us? - You got along without me when I was ill. - It's more interesting now. - Interesting? Oh, Joss, don't spoil everything. I know it's difficult but we are alive. Just think how alive we are. It isn't like home where nothing ever happened. Hey, miss. See what I found? Champagne cork. You must keep it. Very lucky. - Thank you. - You do not want? Doesn't seem very lucky. - There's some champagne, you want it? - I don't. I not let that She-Cat get it. - He means Mauricette. - Oh, what could we do with it? We could drink it. - I'll get it. - Drink it? - Hester. - Well... You know, Joss, Paul is not bad when you get to know him. Soon you'll feel better. There. Now... - Santé! - Santé?! Good health! I not drink to that. I drink to the devil with all the cockroaches. - The devil and the cockroaches. - The cockroaches. I thought you had to drink to something nice. People at Les Oeillets not nice. Paul is right. They are not nice. - Pretty quick, eh? Another bottle? - But the wine is locked up. - Madame Corbet has the key. - Not now. I go for more. - But, Paul, should you? - Go on, go on. - You're angry. - What of it? I'm afraid of what you will do. When they find out... They can't do anymore than they've already done. - Paul will get into trouble. - Shut up. - Shut up. - (JOSS CHUCKLES) - Quoi? - It sounds so funny when you say it. (LAUGHS) Shut up. (GIGGLES) Shut up. - Mettez un bouchon. Same thing? - Mettez un bouchon. - Put a sock in it. - Put a sock in it. - Tonight, you grow up a little. - No. - Come on. Just a little. - No. Oh... (IN FRENCH) I'm beginning to feel a little Blanc-ety Blanc all over. - More. - Hey, you cook on gas. Fill it! Fill it! Fill it! - Joss, not any more please. - Shut up. - Shut up. Mettez un bouchon. - Put a sock in it. I wish they could see us at school now. (PAUL CHUCKLES) (PAUL AND JOSS GIGGLING) - Paul? - Eh? It was sweet of you to get me this wine. Joss, don't. He'll think you mean it. What if he does? You give cigarettes to Hester. Why not to me? OK. Here is your cigarette. Come on. Come, come, come on. I light it. (BOTH GIGGLE) - Joss, don't. - (JOSS) Why not? You'll hurt him. - I will hurt him. - (HESTER) You're getting drunk. I want to get drunk. I'll do all the disgusting things they do. (LAUGHING) No more Blankety Blank. Open the other bottle. - No. - Yes. (MUMBLES IN FRENCH) Boozy! Do you hear that, Hester? (PAUL AND JOSS LAUGHING) Blanc-ety, Blanc-ety Blanc! Blanc-ety Blanc...! Boozy! (SPEAKS FRENCH) What does Boozy say? He says before drinking such a fine wine, why don't you pray. All right. Let's pray. You are not to, Joss. (BANGING TABLE) You are not to. - Pious prig. - I'm not a prig. - Don't. Cry baby. - I'm not a cry baby. Cry, then. Howl. I don't care. Paul, hurry up with that wine. (SPEAKS FRENCH) Hit it, Boozy. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. (PAUL GIGGLES) - Paul? Paul? - Shut up. I don't want any. Encore une cigarette. Come and get it. Come on. (PAUL GIGGLES) What did they do to this room? - Joss, don't go over there. - (PAUL) Shut up. Don't you dare touch her. Paul, you are so nice. Oh, I feel so drunk. - Joss? - Shut up. Go to your bed. - I won't. - Leave her alone. - I must get her to bed. - You're a child. - Joss? I must... - (ELIOT) Paul! Not me. Them. They made me. Joss, please? She is drunk. Hester, what's all this? Who started this? Oh, to be drunk at their age on my wine. (SPEAKS FRENCH) Hester, please go to your room. - I'll take her. - I'll help you. No, I think you have done enough already. Too much. Oh, my head feels terrible. If this is how grown-ups feel, they are worse pigs than I thought. I can't even remember how I got to bed. M. Joubert carried you upstairs. Not Eliot? Eliot wanted to but M. Joubert wouldn't let him. Good. Finish it, Hester. It's supposed to help. - M. Joubert wasn't angry? - He was angry with Eliot. Wait till Corbet finds out we drank their wine. - She did. Don't you remember? - I don't remember anything at the end. - Eliot said he'd pay. - I don't want him to. (DOOR OPENS) I've just had an experience. At the river and I saw that barge. It's the one we saw with Eliot. The Marie France. - What of it? - Eliot came and saw me standing there. - At first he was sort of angry. - Why? He thought I had been following him but I hadn't. Anyway, it turned out all right. - We all had spending money again. - From Eliot? Yes, here's your share, Hester. What about the snaps you had to pick up? They are in the envelope too. Joss, these are yours. I don't want anything and never want to see him. - What will I do with it? - Throw them in the river. No fear. I know. I'll get some new patterns. Here's the one I took of Eliot at the cathedral. I didn't think it would come out. We had such a wonderful time that day. - Why do things have to change? - Because people change. Hester, you know, I think there is something wrong about Eliot. Why didn't want his picture taken? And at the Champagne Caves, why did he lie about the appointment? - He just wanted to leave, that's all. - Yes, but why so quickly? I don't think he wanted that police inspector to see him. - What was his name? - Renard. Remember. The fox. Renard. That's it. Hester, we have been friends with a man who isn't honest. I don't believe Eliot could be bad. Look at the way he behaved last night. I could almost feel sorry for Mademoiselle Zizi, being in love with a man like that. - He hurts everybody. - Oh, I don't know. My head feels terrible. I'm going back to bed. Hester, give me that snap. - But you just said you didn't like him? - I don't. I hate him. Oh, Joss! - I don't want to talk about last night. - I think not. I would like a 25 franc stamp, please. You can put it on our bill. Thank you. (ELIOT) Hello, Joss. Let's forget what happened, shall we? And start all over again. You don't want to? You may feel like that now but it won't last. I'm just off to Paris. I'll be back tomorrow. - I thought perhaps you and I could... - I'll be busy tomorrow. I'm very, very sorry about last night. Why do you keep doing things you're sorry about afterwards. I wish I knew the answer to that one too. (ZIZI SPEAKS FRENCH) (SPEAKS FRENCH) (ZIZI) Wait! I want to see you. Tonight, we have a big party. It's not for children. And you are to stay upstairs. Understand? - But Eliot said... - Eliot is in Paris. I'll have your dinner sent up to your rooms. - Yes, mademoiselle. - Be sure to tell your sister. Yes, mademoiselle. (ZIZI SPEAKS FRENCH) - What a lovely cake! - It's the biggest cake I ever saw. - I'm an artist with icings. - How's your French, Hester? - Improving. - Then translate this. (SPEAKS FRENCH) "The most daring robbery carried out in broad daylight on the Rue de La Paix." - What are those funny little men on top? - They are musicians. It is for the Instrument Makers' ball tonight. "The bandit, armed with a revolver made his escape in an open car "with jewels worth 10 million francs." - Smart fellow. - We're not allowed at the party. Will you save us some cake, M. Armand? - If you are a good girl. - I am. "The pattern of the hold-up leads the police to believe... "That it is again the work of Allen, "a bandit of international importance..." It tastes wonderful, M. Armand. "..who was behind the...something...jewels." "The jewel raids at Cannes last year. "Inspector Renard..." - Inspector who? - "Inspector Renard says, "I have seen him but once only, "and this time we shall get him." The line isn't bad but the perspective. I need to learn to draw. I'm going to art school soon. - When? - After the holidays. - For artists, there are no holidays. - Oh. And also, artists do not get mixed up with other things. But there are other things. But not for you. At least, not yet. Psst? Psst? But it was the same man. Inspector Renard. - Eliot ran away from him. - Why do you think it's Eliot? He was in Paris when a robbery happened. So were lots of people. Millions, in fact. - Why Eliot? - He didn't want the inspector to see him. I don't believe Eliot could ever do anything as bad as that. Do you really think so? Promise. Joss, I'm so relieved. (FAST-PACED JIG) (SLOW, SOMBRE MUSIC) (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) We'll speak in English. Now listen carefully. I'm ready to leave. Yes, tonight. Now, this is what you must do. - Joss, are you sure we ought to? - Why not? - If they don't let you stay? - They will. - I can make people do what I like. - You mean men? Look, there's Eliot. - You see? You see? - He wouldn't be here, would he? - Of course, he wouldn't. - Thank heavens. - Ah, the little English girl. - Bonsoir, monsieur. I'm not so very little, am I? It makes no difference. You're beautiful. I must introduce you to someone. Come with me. She looks like a lady. - She's only flirting. - I don't like her doing that. (SPEAKS FRENCH) Why are they kissing her hand? The French are fond of that. (WALTZ PLAYS) Little slut. I told her to stay in her room. You had no right to do that. First it was Paul, and now look at her. Oh, come on, Zizi. Forget her. (LAUGHS) She's just trying to be grown up. A woman in the world. You find excuses for her, always. You want her, don't you? I knew it from the beginning. (LAUGHS) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Paul. Paul, don't! - Allez. - Allez, you. What's the matter? Boy, back to work. Cockroach! Dance me, dance me. They don't want me to. She like me. (INDISTINCT ARGUING) (IN FRENCH) (DOOR CLOSES) Paul? Go away. Allez-vous-en. - Go away or I'll scream. - No scream. Paul, go now and I won't say anything. I won't tell anyone. (JOSS GAGGING) (JOSS) Paul, get away. Paul! No. No, please. (JOSS WHIMPERING) (PAUL) No, no! (JOSS CRYING) (ELIOT) Joss, you all right? Little swine. (PAUL SCREAMS) Listen, Joss... ..try to forget what has happened. Eliot! (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) - Oh! - No, Joss, no. I must call an ambulance, or a doctor. No, it's too late. He's dead. The drainpipe broke. He did it himself. It's terrible. It's horrible. - Joss, go back to bed. - We must call the police. - No. No police. - But the... No, please. I can't have the police. Don't ask any questions? - They're coming. - Huh? I sent that snapshot to Inspector Renard. - What snapshot? - One that Hester took at the cathedral. You sent that snapshot? Oh, Joss! Why? In heaven's name, why? I was jealous. When you left me and went to her, everything was spoiled. Everything. And I loved you so. - When did you send it? - Yesterday. Listen to me, Joss. When the inspector comes, you know nothing. Understand? You know nothing about tonight. You never saw me or Paul. You must promise me. - But they'll find him. - Not until I'm out of France. - They'll be searching the roads. - Not the one I'm taking. Now go back to bed quietly, and don't disturb anyone. - I'll never see you again? - Who knows? - I'll never love anyone else. - Oh... You say that now. Little Joss, this summer you grew up. You became a woman. Then kiss me that way. (PANTING) (IN FRENCH) Which of you took this photograph? I did. I took the picture. - And you are? - Hester. Hester, age 13. And you've succeeded in doing what no one else has ever done. - Getting a photograph of Allen. - He isn't Allen. - He's Eliot. - He's had many names. Now I must ask you for the negative. - I won't give it to you. - But you sent a picture. You were trying to help. (JOSS) I sent it, Inspector. Oh. You at least wish to bring this man to justice. No. (RENARD) Then why did you send it? For personal reasons. I'd give anything not to have sent it. A fine friend you are. - After all he did for you. - Mademoiselle, please. - But Eliot is our friend. - Your friend is a thief. A thief who stole in many countries. No, he was a soldier. He said he was a soldier. Oh, yes. He was. With a good record and a good family. It's all here. Then a scandal, a women, of course. The army punished him severely, discharged him dishonourably. He never went home. That is when his crimes began. First little ones, and then always bigger. Until he's now a formidable criminal. You're visitors here. And we welcome you. But now you can help us by answering my questions carefully. - When did you last see him? - They saw him at the ball, which is the last any of us saw of him. Mademoiselle, please do not answer questions unless they are directed to you. When did you last see him? - Speak up. - We'd rather not talk to you. Suppose you knew that Allen... Eliot was a murderer as well as a thief. - Would you still like him? - Yes. - Defending a murderer? - (HESTER) He isn't a murderer. - (RENARD) He killed Paul. - He wouldn't do such a thing. You have no proof. No one saw him commit the murder or throw the body in the river. But Madame Corbet will testify there were bad feelings between them. She told you that. When a murder is committed where no one has actually seen the crime, but where the circumstances point to a felon, the presumption of guilt is usually strong enough for the state to execute him. - He didn't kill Paul. - How do you know? - I was there. I saw it. - (HESTER) Joss... - What did you see? - He fell. - He was pushed. - No. His neck was broken. He didn't fall. It was an accident. He fell off the drainpipe. - Drainpipe? - The one he used... - ..to come to my room. - She wanted him to come. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) What did I say? This person, you call a child. You see what she was up to? - With Paul, and how many others? - It's a lie. The way you all lie here. The night you were drunk together? Do you deny that? And when you and Paul made a scene on the dance floor? I couldn't help it any more than his coming to my room. No. You can't help anything. But everywhere you are things happen. Bad things. It has been that way here ever since you came. Everything bad was here from the first night. I didn't know there was so much evil. We didn't bring it. It was here, all of you. Except Eliot. Check on that drainpipe. See if there are any marks under the girl's window. (JOSS SOBS) Mademoiselle, you're a woman of experience. By protecting this man, you're open to suspicion of collusion, of being an accessory. Surely, you have no illusions about Allen. I have no illusions, no. - But I love him. - (CAR APPROACHING) Dufour. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) Sorry, monsieur, but this evening the hotel is closed. I'm not a guest. I'm Bullock, a solicitor. (HESTER) Uncle William! How did you get here? (VICKY AND Willmouse SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) One at a time. Now everything's gonna be all right. - Hello, Joss. - Hello, Uncle William. This is Mademoiselle de Presles, Madame Corbet and Inspector Renard. - How do you do? - How do you do? - There's been some trouble. - That's why I'm here. - You know? - Yes. - How, if I may ask? - By the telegram. - What telegram? - I thought you knew about it. "Come immediately, Hotel Les Oeillets. "Your sister in hospital, children urgently need your help." (CORBET) Who sent it? (BULLOCK) It's not signed. - Eliot sent it of course. - (RENARD) Eliot? He always looked after us, didn't he, Joss? Yes. Always. Give it to me. He's wanted by the police. - Don't give it to him? - Mademoiselle, please. It was sent from Chalons at 8.00 this morning. - He was heading for the German border. - (RENARD) Hmm. Chalons... - Chalons is very near here. - Not 70 kilometres away. He's had at least seven hours. I don't understand. (DUFOUR) Could he be walking? (RENARD) The road's watched. - Chalons? That's on the Marne, isn't it? - (RENARD) The Marne. The Marne, the river. The one route we forgot. Search all barges between Chalons and the border. This time we've got him. Madame Corbet, I want to telephone quickly. (HESTER CRYING) Mademoiselle, I... He was our friend, Uncle William. He was our friend. Yes, he proved that by sending the telegram. You'll forget all about this when you're back in England. No, we'll never forget. Never! (DOVES COOING AND FLUTTERING)
