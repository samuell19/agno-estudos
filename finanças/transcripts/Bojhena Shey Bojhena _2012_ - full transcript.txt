Your mindset is so childish.. ..that you will just keep on looking at girls all your life. You wouldn't be able to get them. I have told you. Go on, go on. Now go and start the machine. Too much. Hey! Who are you? Yes? What are you doing in my room? Get out of the room. People will misunderstand if they spot you here. People can also misunderstand.. ..when you wave your hand from this terrace.. ..to that terrace, give signals, smile with all your teeth out. Right? True, isn't it? - I.. How are you bothered if I give signals to some girl or not? I am bothered. Because that girl in question.. is me. Yes, I know you cannot see my face clearly from a distance. But don't you understand if there is a difference between a girl.. ..and her mother? Hey, do you have some defect in your eyes? Do you know? You give signals to my mother instead of me at times. Now how can I make mother understand.. ..that you have dialed a wrong number? - You are very good looking. You have been watching me for the last 6 months. You know very well that I come to the terrace around 8 in the morning. So you can stand from 7.45 to 8.15. What difference does it make if I come or not? And what should you stand there for so long? You can just wave your hands for no reason. Why? What is the point? Listen, I have come to know that you are hitting on me.. ..two days after you started doing it. And I understood as well. And then, I saw you in the different shops of the colony. In the tea shop or cigarette shop.. - I don't smoke cigarettes. I know. Your friends do. You sit in the tea stall and yet don't have tea. You have milk. What is your name? Noor Islam. Muslim? Will do. I had thought that when I meet you for the first time.. ..I will give you two tight slaps. And then I saw that you seem good enough to look at and talk well. I changed my decision. What is your salary? - What? How much do you get as salary? 6000. It is the 6th of the month.. ..and yet you haven't opened the envelope of the salary. There is an alarm of 6 in the mobile. I guess it is for me. There is no name other than your mother on the call list. Why? What? - You don't call anyone and no one calls you either. Yes. Why did you call mother.. Why did you have to call mother? Yes? Mother. - Yes, tell me. Mother. Don't believe a word that the girl has told you. She spoke rubbish to you. What? What are you saying? Are you intoxicated in the morning? What are you saying? Hey, what did you tell mother? I haven't told her anything. I haven't even called her. You thought of it on your own. Mother, I will call you later. I am leaving for work. You are very scared of mother. Why? Why? What is the need to be so scared? You wear clothes by matching your clothes with mine? Why? Do you love me? Come to the kids' garden at 5 in the evening. Kids? - Yes. It is just right for you. But they wouldn't let me go before 7 in the evening. Take permission and come to the kids' garden at 5 in the evening. But two hours prior to the.. - Take leave. But from the time I have started working.. ..till date, I haven't taken a leave ever. Now start taking them. As you fallen in love now.. ..you will have to do a lot of things like this now. Bunking office. Telling lies. Talking to the police with courage. Thrashing people. The faster you learn all this the better it will be for you. And if you cannot do this, don't have an affair. There is no point. And get the salary envelope while coming. I need it. "No, no."

Bonus. What have we asked for? We have asked for bonus. 8.33%. I have been seeing that you have been shifting chairs since a long time. What is your intention? Trust me, sir. I don't have any intention. I am looking for someone called Shyamal Dutta. This is your primary right. Do you know Shyamal Dutta? No, sir, I don't know anyone. I mean, I was told by Ria.. There is a girl called Ria.. sent me here. Is one month's salary.. - Ria? - Is that right? - Yes. Are we asking for a lot? The whole of India.. - Go and sit in the tea shop outside.

If you would have known earlier.. ..you wouldn't have fallen in love with me.. ..or waved your hands at me from the terrace? Yes, I would have and waved as well. But.. You should have told me earlier. What did you tell him about us? Mad? Does anyone say anything? I have told him. - What? Now you go and ask him about what he has to say.

Look, I always have breakfast by nine in the morning.. ..and have lunch by 1.30. Now it is almost 3 and I haven't had either of both. Can I eat something? Don't girls of Kolkata cook at home? Even the boys of Kolkata do. Why? Tell me. In that case, why have they come here to eat? This is their workplace. Once they come here.. ..they don't know when they will go back home. And one can get everything here. Whatever one may need. And hence, this becomes their home and their world. Everything. Do you have stew? - Yes, I do. - What will you have? One minute. The dot has moved. - What? The dot on the forehead has moved. Tell me, what will you have? I am having chicken stew and bread. You? Mother says that on a good day, one mustn't have non-vegetarian.

Now we have to go to sister's house. What do you mean by we? I mean, since you have helped me so much.. ..you can take me to sister's house.. Where is your sister's house? That is what she said. Salt Lake. CI Lines. Okay, come on, we need to take an auto. Come on. Are you still scared? Actually I couldn't trust you for all this while. That is why I wasn't scared as well. Now I trust you a little. That is why I am scared. Bus. What? Oh no. - What is it? This is my office bus. It is gone. Hey, come on, come on. Just because you haven't gone to office.. ..doesn't mean you cannot get up on the office bus. Hey, his legs are paining. How will he come? She is calling you.. - His pain of the legs has come up to his stomach. Come up.. - Come on, come on. Come up, come up. Move.. - Hey, sit here. Nice. Call him. They are calling you from behind. What have you started? Tell me. It is not what you think it is. Hey, I went to the bus stand to drop brother-in-law. The poor one has come to Kolkata for the first time. She doesn't know her way around. And all of you have.. Okay, you went to drop brother-in-law. So I am sure you took your bike. Oh no, I have left my bike behind. Will I get it if I go now? Hey, nothing will happen. If I had a girl like that with me.. ..even I would have left my bike behind. Friends, is the bike first or the girl? Of course, the girl is first. Hey, call her. What is the need? - Call her. She is calling you. - What? He is a very nice boy. In the last two years, I have proposed to him.. ..hundred times, in hundred ways and in hundred different languages. What are you doing? - But he didn't pay attention. He is my colleague. He took pity on me and married me. He is my Mr. Helper. Drop her safely. - Thank you, friends. Bye. Go home early. - Go now. Bye, bye. We will meet at the office tomorrow. Hey, I forgot to ask you. How was your interview today? It was good. But they will not keep me in Kolkata. They will send me to Chennai. I declined. That is good. You mustn't go to an unknown city to work. The experience that you had on coming to Kolkata for the first time. We have come to CI Line. Now where is your sister's house? What is the address? - What? Sister's house? I mean.. She had told me. I have forgotten. What will happen now? Give her a call and ask for the address. - Yes. Hey, no. You call only from a booth. Come on, we will look for a booth. Hello? - Hello, sister. - Yes. The place you had told me about.. CI lane. I am there. Yes, do something. Ask someone for City center. Walk towards the city center. If you come ahead a little you will see house on the right side. And the name of that is Purulia Bhawan. And when you come ahead of Purulia Bhawan a bit.. ..you will.. - Sister, I.. On the left side, there is a lane. - I didn't understand anything. Okay, wait for sometime. I am giving the phone to him. Okay? One minute. One minute. Sister. Can you please talk to her? Hello. Okay, fine. Come on. You got it already? She was giving you directions. She just told me the address. Come on. One minute. Brother. Two big chocolates. And.. One King. -What King? King, right? A big Gold flake. One. - Gold flake. This is the one. Hey, Joi. You are here? - Sister. Oh, I see. So he is the one? According to your brief, everything matches. Shirt and pant. And he is quite tall as well. And to an extent of the scar of his cheek as well. But there is something that doesn't match. - Keep quiet. He doesn't look doubtful at all. At the first glance, I know. I can trust him with closed eyes. No, actually that was earlier.. I mean.. By mistake.. - I see. Actually she couldn't trust you at the beginning. Why? Just because I am a stranger from the city? Look, please don't mind. This is a lot like the conception. Just because someone is a politician, he has to be bad. I agree that some people of my city are bad. But the others are good. Just because of some bad people.. ..why should the others be blamed? I know I love my city a bit too much. Ultimate Kolkata is my own city. Balughat is my town. - And this house is mine. And should I not offer one cup of tea to the person.. ..who has helped my sister so much? Please come in. - No, I cannot do so today. Actually.. My bike.. If I go after this, I will have to collect it from the police station. Some other time.. - Okay. But the next time you come, you have to come in. Oh no, I think the cat has come to the kitchen again. I am going. Okay? Joi. Come. I am leaving. Bye. - Can I say something? But you wouldn't mind. Tell me. - I am saying something. You can call it an advice as well. If you meet a girl at the bus stand some other time.. ..don't make the mistake of wasting an entire day, bunking office.. ..wasting a leave and leaving your bike behind. Don't be so good. Just become a little clever. As you say, boss. I am leaving. Come to my house if you come to Balurghat. I owe you a favor. I will repay it with interest. I will come to Balurghat? Okay. If I ever come, it will be enough if you repay the favor. I don't need the interest. "Someone showed me a glimpse even when I asked for a little."

Wait, I will check if everyone has got up. What happened, brother? I was feeling like puking. That is why I came here and sat. I see. - You can sit on my seat. - Okay. Hey, everything is fine. Come on, come on, come on, come on. "I love you, my lover." "Ooh La, la." "My lover." "Ooh La, la." "I love you, my lover." "Ooh La, la." What happened? - Ooh La, la? Are you looking at girls? - No, no. Hey, listen. These girls play sports. So what should I do? - Even you play. Oh no, what are you doing? I had told you so many times to pick me from home. Actually.. I had told you so many times. Why didn't you pick me from home? Now leave me. Hey, listen, I am very scared of your father. He shows me the gun all the time. I see. So if my father asks you to leave me now.. ..you will leave me. Hey, no, no, he is a gentleman. He will not say that at all. Listen to me carefully. Even if asks you.. ..don't ever leave me. Got it? - Acting smart, are you? Hey, are you in love? Let me teach you a lesson. Hit him. Hit him. He loves Ria.. What did you tell him? - What? To him? What did you say? - What? I didn't get time to say anything. He went on hitting me. He had other men with him too. Are you a doctor? Hey, oh no, oh no. Oh Lord. What are you doing? Why? Would it be better if I was a doctor? No, no, a nurse will do fine for me. No, I mean, I had a dream since childhood. I will have a love marriage with a nurse when I grow up. What did he say to you? - What? What did he say to you? I didn't believe what he said. - What? He said that he is in love with you for the last 6 years. Water. Open your mouth. Whatever he said was right. Hey, Ria. Hey, Ria. Hey, Ria. Listen to me now. What happened? Hey, Ria. What happened? - He has been after me for the last 6 years. I didn't pay attention. Then, one day, all of a sudden, he called me.. ..and said that I think of myself as Madhuri Dixit. And I wouldn't get a better boy than him in this world. Yes. I am better than him in all respects. Meet me at Malda Government hospital tomorrow. Why? Are you a government hospital nurse? No. - I am a nurse in this private hospital. Then why should we meet there? That is because I asked you to. Hey, hey.. Sorry. Have you got a passport size photograph? - Yes. Take. You should have told me earlier that.. ..we are getting a registry marriage done. Registry isn't happening. Then? What is your date of birth? 12th of May, 1986. Sign it. What form is this? Organ donation. - Meaning? After you die.. ..all the organs of yours that will get wasted.. ..will be donated by you. I want to make a call at home. What is the need to be scared about everything? Even I made the donation. Did I ask anyone? Sign it quietly. Sign it. Sign it. Actually this is the first time. Everything happens for the first time in life. You are having an affair for the first time. Yes, but.. Sign it. They will take it after I die, right? Thank you. - Thank you. What is your age? 26. What do you think? How old do you think I am? How old can you be? I am just four.. Four years younger? That means, you are 22. I am four months older than you. Hey, Ria. Hey, Ria. - Listen to me. I am saying that it doesn't matter. I will manage it. Listen.. How is Raghav in this situation? Oh Lord, how would I know? You don't know? I am telling the truth. I don't know. Why? Are you feeling bad? Feeling bad? - Yes? - I will give you one slap. Firstly, there is a caste problem.. ..and then you are four months younger. Get in. Stop, stop, stop. I am leaving. Meet you later.. Hey! Stop, stop, stop. Ria! Hey, Ria. Listen, I thought a lot. Okay? It doesn't matter if you are four months older. Because now look, Sachin Tendulkar's wife, Anjali.. ..is five years older than him. And Saif Ali Khan's wife, Amrita Singh, was much older than him. And it really doesn't matter if we are Hindu and Muslims. Because look at Saif Ali Khan. He married Kareena Kapoor. Yes. Listen to something. You are not Saif Ali Khan or Sachin Tendulkar. And neither am I Amrita Singh or Anjali. Now, I know that neither am I Sachin nor Saif Ali Khan. None of them. But for me, you are Anjali.. ..Amrita Singh and even Kareena Kapoor. Shut up. Deepa. Sit here. What are you doing? I haven't come here to get treatment done. Hey, Ria. Injection? Yes? Yes. Hey, slowly. Oh no. Hey, Dipa. Listen. Is he done? Take it to the lab. Even she wears a uniform while working like me. But she is so beautiful. Yes. But why did she take my blood? There is a need. It is Monday today, right? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.. We will meet on Thursday evening at 5. What? So many days? Cannot we meet tomorrow? Thursday evening at 5. Go. Go. - Yes. Here you are. What is this? This is an HIV test report. What is that? I got you tested for AIDS. What? You thought I have AIDS? You doubted me, Ria? Why cannot I have a doubt? Are you my school mate? Or a childhood friend? A neighbor or an acquaintance? You are not, right? Then how I can trust you? You say that you love me. That means, after this when we are in love.. What do you mean by after this.. Aren't you in love with me now? No. When we are in love.. ..I am sure you would want to take me to a cinema hall and.. ..hold my hand sitting on a corner seat. Hey, no, no, I swear on Lord. I wouldn't do that. And then when we walk on the roads together.. ..you will touch your fingers to mine first. And then, you will keep your hands on mine. No, no, I don't think about all those things, Ria. And then, when we sit together in the bus.. ..on the pretext of sleeping.. ..you will keep your shoulder on my head. I don't feel sleepy when I get up on the bus. - I see. And then, you stay alone in your house. - Yes. If I go to your house alone one day.. ..you will try to do something wrong with me. - Hey! What rubbish are you saying? Disgusting. I don't think about all those things. I don't.. You won't do anything? - No, no. Then what is the point of having an affair? What? Ria. Hey, Ria. Are you looking for a point in love? - Yes, sure. Love doesn't just mean that.. ..both of us will keep looking at each other, Noor. There are good times and bad times in love. There is profit and loss as well. And when you are in love with me.. ..you will have to face these problems. And that is why I sent you to meet father and Raghav. And on the other side.. ..I am sure your mother doesn't know our age difference. When she comes to know I am sure she will ask questions. Your father will scare you about my father being a cop. And apart from that, you are Muslim and I am Hindu. That problem is already there. Now think over it. If you can handle all these problems.. ..then carry on an affair with me. And if you cannot.. ..I am leaving, boss. Ria. Ria. Ria, I love you. I will accept you the way you are. Ria, I will just live with you. Not like this. Take an hour's time. Think over it and then let me know. What is the point of thinking about this? Think. Think. Ria. Hey, Ria. Ria, actually I thought for an hour. I thought very carefully. If my mother has a problem with our age difference.. ..or if my father tries to scare me by saying.. ..that your father is a cop.. ..then I wouldn't listen to them. I will just live with you. Will you change your opinion later? No, no, not at all. I swear on Lord. I love you too. Come on. Hey.. Hey, Ria. Ria. - What is it? I am saying that I was expecting something bigger than this. What do you mean by that? Hug me. - What? Hug me. - No, no, disgusting. I mean, I am not saying that. I was saying that we can spend a good time, right? Yes? There is no time. I am a nurse. A nurse cannot leave the hospital anytime she feels like.. ..and spend her time. Take a leave. And what should I give as an excuse for a leave? Why? You had said that when a person is in love.. ..he has to bunk office and take leaves. Even you take a leave. Hey! "It is difficult living without you even for a day." "I want to spend a night. Stretch forth your hands." "Break all the obstacles." "Speak. Become alight like a poem." "Like the colors of the garden." "Like the assorted colors." "And the way the colors spread." "Without an address." "Hey, whenever I have wanted you." "We have been separated." "I have said it so many times." "I have got someone who doesn't understand my pain." "It is difficult living without you even for a day." "One day, all of sudden." "I had seen you." "In the lonely veranda." "I had drawn so many images without a reason." "One day, all of sudden." "I had seen you." "In the lonely veranda." "I had drawn so many images without a reason." "I have fallen in love with an innocent mind." "I have looked for you all the time." "I have burnt inside listening to your voice inside me." "It is difficult living without you even for a day." "Now it has started." "Our meetings have started." "The bright light of the love." "And the restlessness of the mind." "Now it has started." "Our meetings have started." "The bright light of the love." "And the restlessness of the mind." "All the times that I have wanted you." "We have been separated." "All the times that I have said it." "I have got someone who doesn't understand my pain." "It is difficult living without you even for a day." I have told everyone at home about our relationship. - Yes. You have told your family? I will tell them. What do you mean? You haven't told them yet? No, I will tell them tonight. Call right now. - I don't have balance in my phone. Call from my phone. -What? Tell me the number. Ria, look.. I mean, listen.. I mean, whatever we have between us.. ..is not a problem. Okay? But if our problem reaches our homes.. ..it will be a bigger problem. And when that problem comes back to us.. ..it will be a bigger problem. Right? What do you think? And if you don't make that call.. ..there will be a problem here. Tell me the number. 97320184. 84? - Yes. Hello. - Hello. Can I speak to Noor's mother? - Hey, no, no.. Hey, it is a call for you. Who is it? - God knows. I don't know. Hello. - Yes, aunt. No, no. - This is Noor's friend. Actually Noor and I have a relationship. And Noor.. Noor is afraid of talking to you about it.

I have told her. Mother has asked me to take you with me. There is no need to go at the moment. We can go at the time of the wedding. No, I mean, I would have taken you there for some other reason. What is the reason? Just.. Now if I take you with me after the marriage to the village.. ..my friends will say. Wow. Noor has such a beautiful wife. But. If I take you with me now.. - Okay? Then my friends will say that.. ..Noor has found a great looking girl.. No, I mean he has found a girlfriend. I see. So that is the reason you want to take me there? Good. Very good. I won't go anywhere with you. Hey, Ria. Ria, I didn't want to say that. Hey, Ria, listen to me. I didn't say that. Hey, Ria. Ria. Ria. Hey, don't go. Hey, Ria. Hey, there are other reasons as well.

Tell me. What is that? Can I ever get angry with my darling? What if I make a mistake some time? I wouldn't be angry even then. -Why not? Why? Why wouldn't you be angry if I made a mistake? Get angry with me if I make a mistake. Got it? Or else, few years after marriage, when we fight.. ..you will say things to me.. ..like you have never stopped me from doing anything.. ..or created obstacles or didn't get angry with me. I wouldn't listen to all that. If I make a mistake, get angry. Yes. And if I don't make a mistake and yet you shout at me.. ..I will give you two tight slaps. - Hey! Hey.

I will give you one tight slap. Give me your hand. - Hey! Hey, why are you giving your hand? I will pick her up. Move. - I see. Continue. Even if you don't say it, I will continue. Hey, Ria. Listen, I didn't understand. Very sorry. I didn't understand that I will push you so hard. Listen to me. Oh no, listen to me. I was asking you to get angry like this. -What? Tomorrow, meet my parents and take me from home. What? Hey, why meet at home? Come to the bus stand. Home. - No, bus stand. Home. - 'Bus stand.' 'What happened? Hey!' Hey, we are reaching Paltanda.
