I have known this before Homing. A locked door. A house of silence and strangers - I've been asked to inquire if you're hungry - Food? I never touch it The financial adviser didn't turn up. You can have his breakfast He phoned his order through, then phoned again to cancel the appointment - For what reason? - Jack spoke to him, not me What reason did he give your friend? Jack said he said he found himself without warning in the centre of a vast aboriginal financial calamity He dearly needs an adviser I won't bring you breakfast if you're going to waste it I abhor waste I have known this before. The door unlocked. The entrance of a stranger The offer of alms. The shark in the harbour Scrambled eggs - Shall I open the champagne? - Is it cold? - Freeing - Please open it - Who is the nook? - We share all burdens, Jack and myself Thank you We're old friends, Jack and myself. We met at a street comer I should tell you he'll deny this account. His story will be different I was standing at a street comer. A car drew up. It was him He asked me the way to Bolsover Street I told him Bolsover Street was in the middle of an intricate one-way system A one-way system easy enough to get into. The only trouble was that, once in, you couldn't get out I told him his best bet, if he really wanted to get to Bolsover Street, was to take the first left... ...first right, second right, third on the left, keep his eye open for a hardware shop... ...go right round the square, keeping to the inside lane, take the second mews on the right and then stop He will find himself facing a very tall office block, with a crescent courtyard He can take advantage of this office block. He can go round the crescent... ...come out the other way, follow the arrows, go past two sets of traffic lights... ...and take the next left indited by the first green filter he comes across He's got the Post Office Tower in his vision the whole time All he's got to do is reverse into the underground car park, change gear... ...go straight on, and he'll find himself in Bolsover Street with no trouble at all I did warn him, though, that he'll still be faced with the problem, having found Bolsover Sheet, of losing it I told him I knew one or two people who'd been wandering up and down Bolsover Street for years They'd wasted their bloody youth there. The people who live mere... ...their faces are grey, they're in a state of despair, but nobody pays any attention, you see All people are worried about is their illgotten gains. I wrote to The Times about it Life At A Dead End, I called it. Went for nothing Anyway, I told him that probably the best thing he could do... ...was to forget the whole idea of getting to Bolsover Street I remember saying to him: This trip you've got in mind, drop it, it could prove fatal But he said he had to deliver a parcel Anyway, I took all this trouble with him because he had a nice open face He looked like a man who would always do good to others himself Normally I wouldn't give a fuck. I should tell you he'll deny this account. His story will be different - When did you last have champagne for breakfast? - Well, to be quite honest, I'm a champagne drinker - Oh, are you? - I know my wines. Dijon In the thirties I made many trips to Dijon, for the winetasting, with my French translator Even after his death, I continued to go to Dijon, until I could go no longer You will wonder of course what he translated. The answer is my verse. I am a poet - I thought poets were young - I am young - Can I help you to a glass? - No, thank you - An excellent choice - Not mine Translating verse is an extremely difficult task Only the Rumanians remain respectable exponents of the waft Bit early in the morning for all this, isn't it? Finish the bottle. Doctor's orders Can I enquire as to why I was locked in this room, by the way? Doctor's orders Tell me when you're ready for coffee It must be wonderful to be a poet and to have admirers. And translators And to be young. I'm neither one nor the other You've reminded me. I must be off. I have a meeting at twelve - Thank you so mum for breakfast - What meeting? A board meeting. I'm on the board of a recently inaugurated poetry magazine We have our first meeting at twelve. Can't be late - Where's the meeting? - At The Bull's Head in Chalk Farm The landlord is kindly allowing us the use of a private room on the first floor It is essential that the meeting be private, as we shall be discussing policy - The Bull's Head in Chalk Farm? - Yes. The landlord is a friend of mine It is on that account that he has favoured us with a private room It is true of course that I informed him Lord Lancer would be attending the meeting He at once appreciated that a certain degree of sequesteredness would be the order of the day - Lord Lancer? - Our patron - He's not one of the Bengal Lancers, is he? - No, no. He's of Norman descent - A man of culture? - Impeccable credentials - Some of these aristocrats hate the arts - Lord Lancer is a man of honour. He loves the arts He has declared his love in public. He never goes back on his word But I must be off. Lord Lancer does not subscribe to the view that poets can treat time with nonchalance - Jack could do with a patron - Jack? - He's a poet - A poet? Really? Well, if he'd like to send me some examples of his work, double spaced on quarto... ...with copies in a separate folder by separate post in case of loss or misappropriation... ...stamped addressed envelope enclosed, I will read them - That's very nice of you - Not at all. You can tell him he can look forward... to a scrupulously honest and, if I may say so, highly sensitive judgment I'll tell him. He's in a real need of a patron The boss could be his patron but he's not interested Perhaps because he's a poet himself It's possible there's an element of jealousy in it, I don't know Not that the boss isn't a very kind man. He is. He's a very civilised man. But he's still human - The boss is a poet himself? - Don't be silly. He's more than that, isn't he? He's an essayist and critic as well He's a man of letters I thought his face was familiar Yes, sir I have known this before. The voice unheard. A listener. The command from an upper floor Charles. How nice of you to drop in. Have they been looking after you all right? Benson, let's have some coffee You're looking remarkably well. Haven't (hanged a bk. It's the squash, I expect Keeps you up to the mark. You were quite a dab hand at Oxford, as I remember Still at it? Wise man. Sensible chap. My goodness, it's been years When did we last meet? I have a suspicion we last dined together in '38, at the club Does that accord with your recollection? Croxley was there, yes Wyatt, it all comes back to me, Burston-Smith. What a bunch. What a night, as I recall All dead now, of course Ne, no, I'm a fool. I'm an idiot. Our last encounter, I remember it well Pavilion at Lord's in '39, against the West Indies, Hutton and Compton batting superbly Constantine bowling, war looming. Surely I'm fight? We shared a particularly fine bottle of port You look as fit now as you did then Did you have a good war? Oh thank you. Denson. Leave it there, will you? That will do How's Emily? What a woman Black? Here you are What a woman. Have to tell you I fell in love with her once upon a time Have to confess it to you. Took her out to tea, in Dorchester Told her of my yearning. Decided to take the bull by the hams Proposed that she betray you. Admitted you were a damn fine chap... ...but pointed out I would be taking nothing that belonged to you Simply that portion of herself all women keep in reserve, for a rainy day Had an infernal job persuading her. Said she adored you... ...her life would be meaningless were she to be false Plied her with buttered scones, Wiltshire cream, crumpets and strawberries Eventually she succumbed Don't suppose you ever knew about it, what? Oh, we're too old now for it to matter, don't you agree? I rented a little cottage for the summer. She used to motor to me twice or thrice a week I was an integral part of her shopping expeditions You were both living on the farm then. That's light, her father's farm She would come to me at tea-lime, or at coffee-lime, the innocent hours That summer she was mine, while you imagined her to be solely yours She loved the cottage. She loved the flowers. As did I Narcissi, crocus, dog's tooth violets, fuchsia, jonquils, pinks, verbena Her delicate hands. I'll never forget her way with jonquils Do you remember once, was it in '37, you took her to France? I was on the same boat. Kept to my bin. While you were doing your exercises... ...she came to me. Her ardour was, in my experience, unparalleled. Ah well You were always preoccupied with your physical condition, were you not Don't blame you. Damn fine figure of a map. Natural athlete Medals, scrolls, your name inscribed in gold Once a man has breasted the tape, alone, he is breasting the tape forever His golden moment can never be tarnished. Do you run still? Why was it we saw so little of each other, after we me down from Oxford? I mean, you had another string to your bow, did you not. You were a literary man. As was I Yes, yes, I know we shared the occasional picnic, with Tubby Wells and all that crowd We shared the occasional whisky and soda at the dub, but we were never dose, were we? I wonder why. Of course I was successful awfully early - You did say you had a good war, didn't you? - A rather good one, yes - How splendid. The RAF? - The Navy - How splendid. Destroyers? - Torpedo boats - First rate. Kill any Germans? - One or two - Well done - And you? - I was in Military Intelligence - Oh - You pursued your literary career, after the war? - Oh yes - So did I - I believe you've done rather well Oh quite well, yes. Past my best now Do you ever see Stella? - Stella? - You can't have forgotten - Stella who? - Stella Winstanley - Winstanley? - Bunty Winstanley's sister - Oh, Bunty. No, I never see her. - You were rather taken with her - Was I, old map? How did you know? - I was terribly fond of Bunty He was most dreadfully annoyed with you. Wanted to punch you on the nose - What for? - For seducing his sister - What business was it of his? - He was her brother That's my point. What on earth are you driving at? Bunty introduced Rupert to Stella. He was very fond of Rupert He gave the bride away. He and Rupert were terribly old friends - He threatened to horsewhip you - Who did? - Bunty - He never had the guts to speak to me himself Stella begged him not to. She implored him to stay his hand. She implored him not to tell Rupert - I see. But who told Bunty? - I told Bunty I was frightfully fond of Bunty. I was also frightfully fond of Stella - You appear to have been a dose friend of the family - Mainly of Arabella's. We used to ride together - Arabella Hinscott? - Yes - I knew her at Oxford - So did I - I was very fond of Arabella - Arabella was very fond of me Bunty was never sure of precisely how fond she was of me, nor of what form her fondness took - What in God's name do you mean? - Bunty busted me I was best man at their wedding. He also busted Arabella I should warn you that I was always extremely fond of Arabella Her father was my tutor. I used to stay at their house I knew her father well. He took a great interest in me Arabella was a girl of the most refined and organised sensibilities I agree Are you trying to tell me that you had an affair with Arabella? A form of an affair. She had no wish for full consummation She was content with her particular predilection. Consuming the male member I'm beginning to believe you're a scoundrel How dare you speak of Arabella Hinscott in sum a fashion? - I will have you blackballed from the dub - Oh my dear sir, may I remind you... ...that you betrayed Stella Winstanley with Emily Spooner, my own wife... ...throughout a long and soiled summer, a fad known at the time throughout the Home Counties May I further remind you that Muriel Blackwood and Doreen Busby... ...have never recovered from your insane and corrosive sexual absolutism? May I further remind you that your friendship with and corruption of Geoffrey Ramsden at Oxford... - ...was the talk of Balliol and Christchurch Cathedral? - This is scandalous! How dare you? - I will have you horsewhipped - It is you, sir, who have behaved scandalously To the fairest of sexes, of which my wife was the fairest representative It is you who have behaved unnaturally and scandalously. to the woman who was joined to me in God - I, sir? Unnaturally? Scandalously? - Scandalously. She told me all - You listen to the drivellings of a farmer's wife? - Since I was the farmer, yes You were no farmer, sir. A weekend wanker I wrote my Homage in Wessex in the summerhouse at West Upfield - I never had the good fortune to read it - It is written in terza rima ...a form whim, if you will forgive my saying so, you have never been able to master This is outrageous! Who are you? What are you doing in my house? Benson! A whisky and soda You are dearly a lout. The Charles Wetherby I knew was a gentleman I see a figure reduced. I am sorry for you Where is the moral ardour that sustained you once? Gone down the hatch Down the hatch. Right down the hatch I do not understand... I do not understand, and I see it all about me continually How the most sensitive and cultivated of men can so easily change, almost evernight... ...into the bully, the cutpurse, the brigand In my day nobody changed. A man was Only religion could alter him, and that at least was a glorious misery We are not banditti here I am prepared to be patient. I shall be kind to you I shall show you my library. I might even show you my study I might even show you my pen, and my blotting pad. I might even show you my footstool Another I might even show you my photograph album You might even see a face in it which might remind you of your own, of what you once were You might see faces of others, in shadow, or weeks of others, turning Or jaws, or backs of necks, or eyes, dark under hats, which might remind you of others... ...whom once you knew, whom you thought long dead But from whom you will still receive a sidelong glance, if you can face the good ghost Allow the love of the good ghost. They possess all that emotion, trapped Bow to it. It will assuredly never release them, but who knows what relief it may give to them Who knows how they may quicken in their chains, in their glass jars You think it cruel to quicken them, when they are fixed, imprisoned? No, no. Deeply, deeply, they wish to respond to your touch, to your look And when you smile, their joy is unbounded. And so I say to you. tender the dead... ...as you would yourself be tendered, now, in what you would describe as your life They're blank, mate. blank. The blank dead Nonsense - Pass the bottle - No - What? - I said no No pranks. No mischief. Give me the bottle - I've refused - Refusal can lead to dismissal - You can't dismiss me - Why not? - Because I won't go - If I tell you to go, you will go. Give me the bottle Bring the bottle - I'll have one myself - What impertinence Well, it doesn't matter. He was always a scallywag Is it raining? It so often rains, in August, in England Do you ever examine the gullies of the English countryside? Under the twigs, under the dead leaves, you'll find tennis balls, blackened Girls threw them for their dogs, or children, for each other, they rolled into the gully They are lost there, given up for dead, centuries old It's lime for your morning walk - I said it's lime for your morning walk - My morning walk? - Ne. I'm afraid I don't have the lime this morning - It's lime for your walk across the Heath I can't possibly. I'm too busy. I have too many things to do - What's that you're drinking? - The great malt whim wounds My God, you haven't got a drink. Where's your glass? - Thank you. It would be unwise to mix my drinks - Mix? - I was drinking champagne - Of course you were. of course - Albert, another bottle - Certainly, sir I can't possibly. I have too many things to do. I have an essay to write. A critical essay We'll have to med! the files, find out what it is I'm supposed to be appraising - At the moment it's slipped my mind - I could help you there - Oh? - On two counts Firstly, I have the nose of a ferret. I can find anything in a file Secondly, I have written any number of critical essays myself - Do you actually have a secretary? - I'm his secretary A secretarial post does less than justice to your talents A young poet should travel. Travel and suffer Join the navy, perhaps, and see the sea. Voyage and explore I've sailored. I've been there and back. I'm here where I'm needed You mentioned a photograph album. I could go through it with you I could put names to the faces. A proper exhumation could take place Yes, I am confident that I could be of enormous aid in that area - Those faces are nameless, friend - And they'll always be nameless There are places in my heart where no living soul has or can ever trespass Here you are. Fresh as a daisy - A drop for you, sir? - No, no. I'll stay where I am - I'll join Mr Friend, if I may, sir? - Naturally - Where's your glass? - No thanks Oh come on, be sociable. Be sociable. Consort with the society to which you're attached To which you're attached as if by bonds of steel - Mingle - It isn't even lunchtime The best lime to drink champagne is before lunch, you cunt - Don't ll me a cunt - We three, never forget, are the oldest of friends - That's why I called him a cunt - Stop talking To our good fortune The light out there is gloomy, hardly daylight at all. It is falling, rapidly Distasteful. Let us close the curtains. Put the lamps on Ah. What relief. How happy it is Today I shall come to a conclusion. There are certain matters... - ...which today I shall resolve - I'll help you I was in Bali when they sent for me. I didn't have to leave, I didn't have to come here But I felt I was called, I had no alternative I didn't have to leave that beautiful isle. But I was intrigued. I was only a boy But I was nondescript and anonymous. A famous writer wanted me He wanted me to be his secretary, his chauffeur, his housekeeper, his amanuensis - How did he know of me? Who told him? - He made an imaginative leap Few can do it. Few do it. He did it. And that is why God loves him You came on my recommendation. I've always liked youth because you can use it But it has to be open and honest. If it isn't open and honest you can't use it I recommended you. You were open, the whole world before you I find the work fruitful. I'm in touch with a very special intelligence This intelligence I found nourishing. I have been nourished by it. It's enlarged me Therefore it's an intelligence worth sewing. I find 'ts demands natural Not only that. They're legal. I'm not doing anything cooked It's a relief. I could so easily have been bent I have a sense of dignity in my work, a sense of honour It never leaves me. Of service to a cause He is my associate. He was my proposer. I've learnt a great deal from him He's been my guide. The most unselfish person I've ever met - He'll tell you. Let him speak - Who to? - What? - Speak? Who to? - To him - To him? To a pisshole collector? To a shithouse operator? To a jamrag vendor? What the fuck are you talking about? Look at him He's a mingejuice bottler, a fucking shitcake baker. What are you talking to him for? Yes, yes, but he's a good man at heart. I knew him at Oxford Let me live with you and be your secretary - ls there a big fly in here? I hear buzzing - No - You say no - Yes I ask you to consider me for the post If I were wearing a suit such as your own you would see me in a different light I am extremely good with tradespeople, hawkers, canvassers, nuns I can be silent when desired or, when desired, convivial I can discuss any subject of your choice. The future of the country, wild flowers, the Olympic Games It is true I have fallen on hard times But my imagination and intelligence are unimpaired. My will to work has not been eroded I remain capable of undertaking the gravest and most daunting responsibilities Temperamentally I can be what you wish. My character is, at core, a humble one I am an honest man and, moreover, I am not too old to learn My cooking is not to be sneezed at. I lean towards French cuisine But food without frills is not beyond my competency I have a keen eye for dust. My kitchen would be immaculate I am tender towards objects I would take good care of your silver I play mess, billiards, and the piano. I could play Chopin for you I could read the Bible to you. I am a good companion My career, I admit it freely, has been chequered I was one of the golden of my generation. Something happened. I don't know what it was Nevertheless I am I and have survived insult and deprivation I am I. I offer myself not abjectly but with ancient pride. I come to you as a warrior I shall be happy to serve you as my master. I bend my knee to your excellence I am furnished with the qualifies of piety, prudence, liberality and goodness Decline them at your peril It is my task as a gentleman to remain amiable in my behavior... courageous in my undertakings, discreet and gallant in my executions By whim I mean your private life would remain your own However. I shall be sensible to the least wrong offered you My sword shall be ready to dissever all manifest embodiments of malign forces that conspire to your ruin I will face death's challenge on your behalf. I shall meet it, for your sake, boldly... ...whether it be in the field or in the bedchamber. I am your chevalier I had rather bury myself in a tomb of honour than permit your dignity to be sullied by domestic enemy... or foreign foe. I am yours to command Before you reply, I would like to say one thing more I occasionally organise poetry readings, in the upstairs room of a particular public house They are reasonably well attended, mainly by the young I would be happy to offer you an evening of your own You could read your own work, to an interested and informed audience To an audience brimming over with potential for the greatest possible enthusiasm I can guarantee a full house, and I will be happy to arrange a straightforward fee for you Or, if you prefer, a substantial share of the profits The young. I can assure you. would flock to hear you My committee would deem it a singular honour to ad as your host You would be introduced by an authority on your work, perhaps myself After the reading. which I am confident will be a remarkable ...we could repair to the bar below, where the landlord, who happens to be a friend of mine... ...would I know be overjoyed to entertain you. with the compliments of the house Nearby is an Indian restaurant of excellent standing, at which you would be the guest of my committee Your face is so seldom seen, your words, known to so many... ...have been so seldom heard, in the absolute authority of your own rendering... ...that this event would qualify for that rarest of categories, the unique I beg you to consider seriously the social implications of sum an adventure You would be there in body. It would bring you to the young, the young to you The elderly, also, those who have almost lost hope... ...would on this occasion leave their homes and present themselves You would have no trouble with the press I would take upon myself the charge of keeping them from nuisance Perhaps you might agree to half a dozen photographs or so, but no more Unless of course you positively wished, on sum an occasion, to speak Unless you preferred to hold, let us say, a small press conference, after the reading... ...before supper, whereby you could speak through the press to the world But that is by the by, and would in no sense be a condition Let us content ourselves with the idea of an intimate reading. in a pleasing and conducive environment Let us consider an evening to be remembered, by all who take part in her Let us change the subject. For the last lime - What have I said? - You said you're changing the subject for the last lime - But what does that mean? - It means you'll never change the subject again - Never? - Never - Never? - You said for the last time - But what does that mean? What does it mean? - It means forever It means that the subject is changed once and for all and for the last lime forever If the subject is winter, for instance, it'll be winter forever - ls the subject winter? - The subject is now winter - So Ml therefore be winter forever - And for the last time Which will last forever. If the subject is winter, for example, spring will never come - But let me ask you. I must ask you... - Summer will never come - The trees... - Will never bud - I must ask you... - Snow... Will fall forever. Because you've changed the subject. For the last lime But have we? That's my question. Have I? Have we changed the subject? - Of course. The previous subject is closed - What was the previous subject? - It's forgotten. You've changed it - What is the present subject? That there is no possibility of changing the subject since the subject has new been changed - For the last time - So that nothing else will happen forever - You'll simply be siting here forever - But not alone No. We'll be with you. Briggs and me - It's night - And will always be night - Because the subject... - ...can never be changed But I hear the sounds of birds Don't you hear them? Sounds I never heard before I hear them as they must have sounded then, when I was young Although I never heard them then, although they sounded all about us then Yes. It is hue. I am walking towards a lake Someone is following me, through the trees. I lose him, easily I see a body in the water, floating I am excited. I look closer and see I was mistaken. There is nothing in the water I say to myself. I saw a body, drowning. But I am mistaken. There is nothing there No. You are in no man's land Which never moves, which never changes Which never grows older. but which remains forever, icy and silent I'll drink to that
