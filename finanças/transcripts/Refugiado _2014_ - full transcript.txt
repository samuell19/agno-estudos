Happy birthday, Eugenia! Happy birthday to you! No answer. Straight to voicemail. I'll try again. That's enough! Still nothing. But don't worry, someone will come for you. What's going on? They forgot him? - Yes. Enough! Don't worry. We'll call your mom again. All right? Come on. Okay? Want some water? I think it's this way. This way? Yes, that's right. Mati? Which is your house? It's the next one. In front? - Yes. Not this one, the next one. Bye! Mario, can you open for me? You don't have the keys? - No. Did your mom answer? - No. Mom? Mati, come here. Come on, we're going for help. Mom? Are you okay? Mom? Don't worry. Don't worry. My darling. Help me. Want to hear its heartbeat? There it is. Can you hear it? The baby is fine. Nothing happened to it. Excuse me... How are you feeling? Turn a bit. Now the other side. Lift your hair. Show me your other arm. Raise it a little... That's good. You can get dressed. Mati? Come on, darling. Can you stop the car? I don't feel well. Stop the car. You want to stop here? - Yes. Open the door... Are you okay? Follow me, this way. Hello. Where's my mom? She's with the manager. Shall we go for breakfast? Want me to help? Don't get worked up, kid. I'm not a kid. I've peed myself, too. I was laughing so hard I peed myself. It happens. Hello. Hi. - Hello. We need some clothes for my friend. Have you got anything? Show me. He needs a size 12, right? He needs some underpants, too. Do you have anything? - Here... Let's see... underpants. Let's take a look. Try that. Turn around. I won't do it again, mommy. Don't worry, honey. When will I go back to school? You won't be going, not while we're here. But I'm going to miss my friends' birthdays. And what about football? You can play football with the kids here. You put them down, I think. I already tried, Matías. They shouldn't be down. You're laughing, little pisser? I'm not a pisser. - Yes, little pisser! I'm not a pisser! No! Stop or I'll pee myself again! It's pretty. I like it. You're it! You're it! You're it! You're frozen! You're frozen. Ana, come here! Look what I found! What? A spiderweb! Don't let it get out. That's disgusting. I'm not touching that. You're really brave! Ow! - I told you! Want me to tell you a story? It had better be nice! I dunno. - If it's scary, I'll kill you. It's about death. No, it's not about death! You believed me? One day, me and my mom went shopping. And... And when we came back from shopping, daddy was taking rat poison and he fell on the ground. He passed out. Did they take your dad to the hospital? No, we couldn't take him, it was too far. They couldn't take him. Not here, not here... Stop it, come on. I think there's someone in that shower. Hold my hand. That curtain really scared me... Does he have any weapons? He likes knives. Has he ever... threatened you with a knife? Only as a joke. As a joke? He gave his knives names. And he says, "Don't get smart, don't be silly... or you'll have Don Raúl to deal with." Don Raúl is his knife? - It was just a joke. A joke? - A joke... Are you afraid? When he says that? - Yes. When he comes with a knife. Yes. That's more than a joke, it's a threat. Has he ever threatened to kill you? I don't remember. When I told him... When I told him, he got... Angry? - Yes, to know... That I had... Sorry. - It's fine. Don't worry. When he grabbed me... He said the baby was... from Carlos, my boss. And he started... shaking me. He grabbed me by the arms... and he started to... he took me into the bedroom. I swore to him that... the baby was his. And... And then, he... He held me... he shoved my back against the bedroom mirror and it broke. And then, I think... I don't remember very well. That's okay. After... at one point, I was on the ground... and he started saying that... the baby wasn't his. And as far as he was concerned... "You can die, you and... "that asshole's baby." And then, he... He hit you? In the stomach... and since I was afraid for the baby... I started to... Sorry. - Don't apologize. Can I have a tissue? - Yes. Can you feel it? Yes! Rain! - Yeah, rain! Ana! Ana, come inside! Ana, I told you to come inside. Come inside! Come on. Come on! This colour will enhance your complexion, you'll see. Your hair's already coloured, right? They're crazy! Have you been here a long time? Yeah, a really long time. You don't get bored? - No. I don't like living with my dad. Just my mom. He's difficult? He always says, "Ana, don't touch that! Or that, either!" "I'll smash your little face in, you brat!" Brat! Idiot! - Idiot! Bitch! - Bitch! Slut! - Slut! Language, kids! Mommy, look what we did. Show me. It's lovely. Well done. It's missing you. Make me pretty. What's wrong, mom? Please don't cry, mommy. What's going on? Lunch is ready, let's go. Come on! Your mom will be fine. We'll join you. What's wrong, love? Go and set the table, kids. Come, now. You have to help me too a bit, okay? I'll give you a hand... I don't want to, just leave me here... Come on... Eat Ana, settle down. Sit down. Are you okay, mom? - Eat calmly. Yes, darling, I'm better. Thanks. How are you doing, darling? - Good. Good? Give me your little hand. Don't worry. You're not going to eat? You have to eat. Otherwise you won't feel well. You'll get better faster. Just eat a little, come on. Ana! That's enough! What did I tell you? Did you manage to shower? Yes. Come on, Mati. It's time to get up. The current temperature is 16°C. Humidity is 62%. It is a few minutes past 6 am. Some twenty families are cut off in the town of Ranquel after the Carnero river broke its banks. The flooding was due to the heavy rain which has been ongoing in the area since yesterday morning. Come on, Matías. How are you? - Fine. Don't worry. We go in, you sign the restraining order, and we go. I'll stay with you, don't worry. Let's use the toilet. I don't want to. You won't be able to go after. I already went! It was too long ago, Matías. Come on. Where are you going? To the toilet. Quick, we're almost up. That way. Thanks. Zip it up. You have to help me, Mati. Okay? Look at me. Will you help me? What's going on? I can't go back where we were before. Look at me. I can't. How come? - I can't. Why? It'll be worse than before. I'm with my son. I'm coming. I wanna go back to the shelter. No, we're not going back to the shelter. We're not going back. Matías, listen to me. Matías, please. Don't make this harder! You have to do as I say! Fabián! Hello. - Hello. Laura! What have you got yourself into? How are you? Hello, sweetheart! How are you? We've been worried. He's looking for you. Come on, girls. Leave her alone. Give her some space. Back to work! Don't come back here. It's dangerous. He came to my home yesterday. In a rage. He almost broke down my door. He's crazy. Did he hurt you? No, the neighbour called the police. He left. I'm so sorry. Everything's fine. It's over now. I need somewhere to go. I'll ask my sister. I don't want to cause you problems. He's going to kill you. I need money. Matías! Hi. - Hi! How are you? Fine. Will you help me with the buttons? Okay. Where's your mother? Downstairs, with Paola. Then stay here and help me. Okay. You pick the buttons one by one. Okay. - Yes? Stand here. Okay. - They all have to be the same. Then you put them on the sleeve. Thanks! Thank you! Give whatever you can. Thank you... Hello. - Good evening. Good evening, I was sent here by Silvia. Yes. - She told you about me. I've prepared you a room with a double bed. The bathroom is shared. It's 150 pesos a night. Fine. - Is there TV? Yes, but it costs more. How much? 175. - Okay. Can you open it, please? Go on, Mati. Will it fit? - Yes. There. Thanks a lot. - It's fine. There you go. Sorry, I wanted to ask you... Can you make sure no one knows we're here? Don't worry. Hello? Who's speaking? Hi... Mati? Are you there? Is mommy with you? She's in the shower. Are you at Paola's? I won't tell you. Talk to your mom, Mati. You have to come home, do you understand? Your life is here, Matías. You have to go to school, you have your friends... I miss you, you know. Yes. But if you... If you love her, why do you hit her? I promise you that I'll never do it again. Listen, I need your help. I want to ask mom to forgive me. Understand? Okay. Everything okay? Are you hungry? Should we go eat something good? Yes? Want to taste my ravioli? No? We both deserved a good meal. Don't you think? Let's toast... Because... Everything has a solution in life. Except death. What if dad finds us? He won't find us. What if someone tells him? No one will tell him. Your fries are delicious. Wait for me, Mati! Good evening. Someone brought you these. What's that? We have to leave. - How come? Dad knows we're here. I didn't tell him anything, mommy. When did you talk to him? You were in the shower and the phone rang. What did you tell him, Matías? What did you say? Look at me! What did you say? Tell me what you said to dad. I swear I didn't. You swear you didn't what? Did you say where we are? You told him? - I didn't tell! No? - No. I didn't tell him! - But he knows! Never touch my phone again! Never answer my phone again! Understand? Calm down, tell me you understand. Fine. Where are your shoes? Put your shoes on. No minors! Please, just for tonight. Make an exception until tomorrow. This is no place for you. - I'll go tomorrow. Please do this for me. If there's an inspection, I'll get shut down. What if that's not your son? - I swear he's my son. I'm begging you. I'll go in the morning. Let me stay. Give me 500 pesos. Thank you. Take your hand off there, kid. Don't tell anyone we're here. Don't worry. - Thank you. Room 26, at the end of the hall. Hurry so no one sees you. - Thanks. Go on. Do you forgive me, mommy? What, darling? Do you forgive me? There's nothing to forgive, my little love. Look at me. Listen to me carefully. None of this is your fault. Okay? Okay? Daddy has a problem, and until he resolves it, he's dangerous. But it's not your fault. Don't worry. Okay? Matías? Did you sleep well? What is it? We have to go. Why again? Because we have to. Where are we going? It's a surprise. Okay. Hey, Mario! - Mati! We have to be quiet and very fast. Don't touch anything! I'm going to eat you! Come on, darling, take the toys you want. Quickly. Help me! What toys do you want to take, sweetheart? Pick the ones you like best. We'll take your favourites. Should we take Teddy? Let go! They're mine! I know. - Let go! Choose what you want. - They're mine, mine, mine... That can stay, that too... They stay under the bed. You don't want to take anything? Shall we go? I'm staying, too. No, Matías. We have to go. Listen to me. I want to take everything, too. But I can't, darling. I promise that where we're going... Mati, please. Where we're going, Matías... Come out of there. It's really beautiful. You'll love it, I promise. I promise. - Let go of me. Take those toys. What do you want? The ones under here? Let go of that! That's enough, Matías. They're mine! - No, stop it. Mine! Let go of them! That's enough, Matías. Let go of it. That's enough, we're going. Right now! Let's go. Open the door, Matías! Matías, open the... Go away! I know what we'll do. Go away! What we'll do... We'll take a bigger bag. Go away! I want to stay here! I know that, my little love. Sorry. I didn't mean to get angry. I'm sorry. - Go away! Matías, open the door. Open this door, Matías! Open it! Laura, it's Mario. Fabián is on his way up. Thanks. Matías, listen to me. Matías, do you hear me? Do you hear me? - What? Daddy is on his way up. We're going to fight... Do you hear me? - Isn't he at work? I thought so, but Mario says he's on his way. We have to go! Please open the door, Matías. Please, open it. Open it, darling. Do you want something to happen to mommy? Hey, love? Open up, darling. Can you manage? You have to... Darling, put the key in gently. To the middle, not to the back. Come on. Go on, darling. Go on, my little love. That's it! Let's go. Is daddy coming? Quietly, darling. Okay? Is it good? Why are we underneath China? But... Are we above it or underneath it? We're always moving. And why, when we're underneath, doesn't the water go above? I don't know. It's strange, right? - Yes, very. Coming! Who is it? Laura! We came to visit. Do you remember me? - No. I looked after you when you were a baby. You were like a little bundle. I'd put you here... and you'd go to sleep. How big you are, now! Time goes so fast. I don't know if you're still angry with me... but it was hard for me, too. And you, how are you doing? - Fine. And Fabián? It's complicated. What did he do to you? Does he know you're here? - No, he doesn't. It smells bad. We'll open the door a bit to air it out. Want to sleep in the big bed with me? I don't want to sleep with her. Don't worry. Can we open the door? - Yes. I'll do it. It's stuck. Anything is possible. Mom, what's wrong? Are you okay, Laura? - Yes, I'm fine. How far along are you? Eleven weeks. I'm fine, my angel. Come on! There... That's good. There we go. Lie down, now. I want Teddy. - Teddy? Where's Teddy? There, in the bag. The bear. Is that Teddy? - Yes. Put Teddy down for a siesta. Get some rest. Thanks. Mommy? Yes? When I was in your tummy, did I make you throw up as well? No, when you were in my tummy you made me sleep. Every baby is different. With you, I had lots of time... I'd fall asleep everywhere like a walrus. What's a walrus? A walrus is a great big animal that walks very slowly and falls asleep while it's walking. It walks a bit and falls asleep again. It walks then falls back asleep. Does it snore? Yes, it snores a lot. The other walruses have to wear earplugs. Come on! Come with me. Come on! Come with me. Are you happy to get a little brother? I don't know. They're a bit boring. Really? They just feed all the time. But he'll grow up fast and you'll be able to play with him. They don't know how. They break everything. But you're big. You'll be able to show him. Right? Where are we going? To a friend's house. You'll see. It's this way. There... We stay on this little path. - Is it flooded? Yes, it's flooded. Careful, it's broken here. Marta! Hello! Hi! How are you? Very well. I have my grandson visiting. Hi! - This is my friend, Marta. Check if this is right. We don't have much time. I just opened a little beer. You can't refuse one drink! No one can refuse you anything. No. And even less today, when we have things to celebrate. I'll give you the rest later. No problem. So, let's toast. Cheers! How is she? Good. She finally left him? You see? Things are falling back into place. I don't want to delude myself. No, you just have to wait and be very patient. Nothing more. Want to try the zip-line? What's that? Let him, Marta. He'll love it! My grandkids use it when they come. Want to? Okay. Shall we try, then? Is he attached right? Yes! Relax! That's perfect. It's safe, you'll see. It's perfect like that! If anything happens to him, I'll kill you. Nothing can happen to my grandson. Shall we go? - No! Yes, I mean! I'm Supermatías! I'm going to crash! Hi, Laura? Laura, can you hear me? Please forgive me, my love. I'll never do it again. Do you hear me? I need you to come back. Please! I'm nothing without you both. Laura? Are you there, my love? It was horrible. You're sick, Fabián. But I swear... Yes, you're sick. I'm on the phone, wait outside. Wait outside! - Did you tell him we're here? No, I didn't. Why are you crying? I'm not crying. I was talking. Wait for me outside. What's going on? I can't just stop talking to him from one day to the next. What do you want from me? Matías, go play outside a bit. That's enough, Laura. This has to end. Subtitles: Esther Russell
