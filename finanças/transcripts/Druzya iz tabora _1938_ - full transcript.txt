ACADEMIC COMMENDATION WORLD OF CHESS Good afternoon. Mr. Rypar? My name is Koke?. I've brought you the paperwork on some changes we're making to the building. Isn't that the building manager's job? You don't go to the meetings so you don't know: I've been the manager for two years now. It's about costs for a new elevator to meet EU regulations. It needs to be done fast. If it's a problem for you, don't worry, we can arrange a monthly payment schedule. Oh, I see... I don't have my glasses though. -You don't have your glasses? -That's right. I broke them. They won't be fixed until Friday. So I'll read it on Friday. Mr. Rypar... The postman left some mail for you, so I brought it up. Don't touch my mail, OK? Goodbye!

If he's going to speak in front of the students, I'm taking my class and leaving! VIETNAMESE MARKET IN PRAGUE What does it say? They want our passports to extend our visas. Assholes! Without our passports we're stuck here for good. -We have to run! -No. -It's been three months already! -Where do you want to go? The people in the market would rat us out. Why do you think they walled us up in here? I don't care, I'm out of here! If you give us away, I'll kill you myself! Don't piss me off! You'll give me your passport tonight. We'll get your visa extended. Feeling better? Not really. Get to work anyway, we can't lose time. Hello, I'd like to report illegal flyposting. What happened? I don't know. Hands up! Move it!

Then what are you doing up there? Go way! -I'm asking you a question... -No! Away! Then I'll just have a cigarette and go away. Are you crazy? Jesus Christ... Do you smoke? Do you smoke? No. Good for you. Listen, I'd rather not be here at all. But now that we're talking, I can't just let you jump.

Yeah, I know... Maybe we... Knock? No, no... It's late, the dinner is already cold. She must have had something urgent to do. I saw her run off somewhere from the window. So... consider it a practice run. It'll work out next time. Let's have a sip then. "The time and place is in the letter in front of your door." We're lying there in complete darkness, and I'm holding Zuzana's hand, and then my friend Miro speaks up and says, "I'm gonna take a piss." And as he gets up, the hand I was stroking... It slips away. And I say, "Miro?" And he's like, "What?" "Was that your hand?!" Do you get it? -Do you understand? -No. -I no understand. -You don't... Oh no. What? No more wine. No more? We want more, don't we? Yeah! No, no, no... I'll get it. You kill that duck. It moved. Good evening. Good evening. Well, goodnight then. CONDITIONALS Song? I'm going to open the door. So don't come out, ok? I haven't read the papers yet. Mr. Rypar... You are the only tenant who hasn't signed it. What if I don't want any changes in here? What if I want everything to stay as it is? What do you mean? Maybe I don't want to change anything. I have that right, do I not? Of course. The old regime suited you better, right? Mr. Koke?, listen carefully. A boor like you is not going to tell me... Oh, good morning... I guess you've already met, haven't you? No, we haven't met yet. Good morning, I'm Slavenkov?. This is my boyfriend, Marek. If you ever need anything feel free to knock. I'll be happy to help. Where are you from? I'm sorry? You have an accent. Where are you from? From Russia. Why? -Russia... -But I've lived here for a year. Why do you ask? Russia... Mr. Rypar? Mr. Rypar! So, listen... Anna's a Russian. -What? -She's Russian. I just spoke to her. And a Russian is of no use to us, she doesn't have EU citizenship. There's no time to waste. We'll find a Czech girl. Somewhere. Sir... I don't know. Do you want to clean this place until I die? What will you do then? Sir, I think... I can't Czech girl. I Vietnam, I not good Czech. I guess I can't school here and make money to Vietnam. It... hard... find some girl here... some wife. I not enough. You know what? Close your eyes. -Eyes? -Just close your eyes. Imagine you're an old man. Really old. Got it? You're an old man in a musty flat and you know your life is slowly coming to an end. You don't have the strength to do anything big. You forget things. Something always hurts, you're tired. Or you know what? Imagine you can't even get up anymore. You can't move. People have to take care of you. And all you ever do is think back on your life. And all the things you could have done and didn't. It pisses you off. But you can't do anything about it now. You stare at the ceiling. And you wait. And now open your eyes again. And now you're back. You're a 20-year-old, full of energy, with your whole life ahead of you. How does it feel? It's good. -Sir? -What? -Something here... -Something here stinks. I know. People piss here. "We are all living in the gutter." "And only some of us are looking at the stars." Do you know who said that? I don't know. Oscar Wilde. Smart guy. He would've enjoyed the world of today. People do whatever they want, say whatever they want. And he was gay. That's fashionable nowadays. What happen, sir? -Song... -What? Will you marry me? Anna, open up. CHARLES UNIVERSITY Koke? again?! Will we ignore him? Dad? Dad? Dad, are you in there? Martin, do you take sugar? No, no, thank you. It was you who wrote me? Thank you. But you wrote that... Thank you. Not much has changed here. Is that your computer? Yeah. Ours. Song is my renter. He lives here. I go there. How are you, dad? I'm 79. That's how I am. -Dad? -What? I asked if you have those old reels. I'd like to have them. Oh sure, I do have some. Are you alright, dad? I'm great. Why? Just want to know if you're ok. I was afraid you'd be in the hospital. In the hospital? Why did you come here? I wanted to see you. And why now? I don't know. I'm 40. I see things differently. I was that age when you left. You probably remember. I do. I not blaming you for anything. I was grumpy and pedantic. Even outside the classroom. I kind of understand it now. I just don't understand why you're here today. Nothing has changed here. I still hate this age we live in. People still see me as an old commie. Dad, that's just... Only one thing has changed around here. In your room there's a stranger who must have written you to say I was very sick, right? -Did he write you? -Dad... He wrote I'm sick, didn't he? Is that so hard to understand? Anyone would come to see their dying father! No, sorry. You're right. You know... For years, I wished you'd come. And now you needed to see me before I die. that's understandable. But you came for yourself, Martin. Not for me. I'm not dying. I feel great. I'm very sorry. I could have been a better husband. And, especially, a better father. I regret that. But there's nothing I can do about that now. If you'd ever like to visit again, for any other reason, I'd be very happy. But now, go. Drive carefully.
