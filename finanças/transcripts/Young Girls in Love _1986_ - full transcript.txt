"Young Girls in Love" "The friends you make in high school will be your friends for life." The principal said it on his long speech at the high school entrance ceremony. I came from a junior high school deep in the mountains of Hakusan. I moved to a high school in Kanazawa without any friends, those words really hit home for me. ・～ "To Takako Yoshioka" ・～ But now I assure you, My life would be so much darker if that was my friend for life. You don't have to be so resentful. When you're that beautiful, you became too good for this world. I remembered when she first introduced herself to the class. She went, "I'm Enami Midoriko". With a name as beautiful as Midoriko, and even herself was beautiful, I was just in awed by her. But you know what... What, you wanted to stay up all night with Midoriko and talk about life? There's nothing embarrassing about that. I'm talking about a deeper despair. A despair that upends the whole life of a woman. Even in the midst of her own death, Midoriko still grieves over the cruelty of mankind. When I think of her, I think of her unworldly genius and her beauty. Truly, truly... With her fate as a premature death. It was a will given by God. For now, we can only hope to reach the seventeen years that she lived. It was all glorious and pellucid, when we think of those days. Let us lift our prayers together for those days. That's a hell of a speech for someone who's terrible at Japanese. Bet it was hard to memorize the whole thing, right? -Did you stay up all night? -What's with the attitude, huh? It's a solemn funeral y'know. Today at 11 o'clock will be Tatsuo's wedding Tatsuo? You mean that intern? Now that's a surprise! So that one-sided love was real? Oh, excuse me. We love each other. It was a short but beautiful love that burned. Midoriko will die with her memories in her arms. (Sutra Chanting) I feel miserable. That's how heartbreak works. It's generally not. Tatsuo-san said, "The only ones who shine the most right now are you girls." But then he lost his mind to a female teacher at the junior high school he worked for. Isn't it normal for a teacher to be conceited with lewd? You guys are seriously bad at being good friends. Would you attend the funeral of a friend who had died twice already? Hmm? "The first time I got a funeral invitation was around this time last year. "During PE class, while everyone's watching me. I got carried away on the springboard as I opened my legs. And accidentally ripped my shorts." "The second one was last year's final exam. Her score marks were off by a lot. Red marks in five subjects, It was a disaster. The headmaster told her parents, "If things go on like this, she could be held back". That same day I received the funeral letter." "Short Pants" "Report Card" Well, I appreciate how you deal with your issues and personal growth as a person. How many of these white crosses will she have to make before she actually die? When you become an ordinary housewife with an ordinary husband and ordinary children... I wonder if I'll still receive those black-bordered invitations from you. Just shut up and listen. What is it with you people? I know that you are not the kind of friends who can comfort and encourage me. I know that, but… But you could at least try to have the "de" in "delicacy". She's really pissed On the day you get your heart broken, I'll be holding a Japanese flag on each hand. and I'll dance to "cancan" till I fall. Oh, so did you fall down from dancing last night? What did you just say? You're being a real asshole, you know that? Hey, you two! Cut it out! You're not feeling yourself today, Otaka. I say we go home. C'mon, let's head back. -You sure? Won't your mother be angry with me? -Nah. The shop doesn't open until after 7 o'clock I'm talking about people like Midoriko. Who is in love with someone, You can't really trust people, who talks about their relationship lightly, can't you? That's just something unforgivable, right? I feel like, when you're serious about someone... W-When you truly love someone... I don't think you would publicly talk about stuff like that. It's just like you to say that, Otaka. Saying that being in love with someone is like having the greatest mistake of one's life. And that things like that shouldn't be talked about publicly. -Hey, Otaka... -Hmm? Is there someone you like? And all the sudden you're asking me that? It's not that serious y'know. From the way you've been talking and acting today. Of course I'd ask something like that. I got one, you know. Hmm... Got what? A guy I like. Eh... Eh... You got a guy you like? Don't stutter will ya. So you got a guy you like? But why are you telling me this so suddenly? Because you, Otaka... Got the "I don't care about love" look on your face. What do you mean I got an "I don't care about love" look on my face? Hey, Taiko, Midoriko... Do you even know what it means to love someone? We all live by our own rules. In the same way, the person you love also has their own rules." That's why... that's why... to love someone means... That for the first time ever, Your own rules and your loved one's rule will crash into each other. Meaning, the way you do things in the past, the way you think, the way you feel, the way you live, won't apply anymore. Don't you think that's a little scary? "Oh look, I've finally found the love of my life." You think blabbering about stuff like that so lightly is right? (Announcer) "Everyone please gather on counter no.5" "Please enter as soon as possible! The movie is about to start in 10 minutes" "All exits are now closed and we're going in a break." So you're into these kind of films? What films? "When a man meets a woman at the right time, they don't need rules to love" It doesn't say anything about high schoolers not being allowed to see it. It's not the kind of film you'd watched after a funeral either. I was back from a wedding! What're you even doing here? You're in high school and you're watching cartoons like "Nine" and "Touch". And you're missing half of them. -Well, I'm in the baseball team. -You dummy. I'm in a hurry. Bye. Why do I have to see him here? This is the worst day ever. ・～ "Masaru Kutsukake" He's not more than an ordinary guy. But why do I keep looking at him like this? Half of me probably isn't even there, it all just happens naturally. I think my eyes are unconsciously following him. It's likely so, I guess I have to admit it. And if you're asking me, what's it like stalking at someone. Well, I'll have to pass on that. ・～ ・～ ・～ Both of my parents are living at the foot of Hakusan Mountain in our hot spring inn. My father is a self-proclaimed local tycoon who wants to be a member of the prefectural assembly. He's also the president of the Ishikawa Ryokan Association. He's always travelling from place to place. So he usually ignores his own Ryokan bussiness. But thanks to that, my sister and I were able to stay upstairs here for free. My sister, Hiroko, is currently in her fourth year at Kanazawa University of Education. I want to get myself a job soon. My parents also want me to be the hostess of my family's inn, so I've been offered the position. I don't know what people are supposed to be doing or studying on university. I just don't get it. You know, I feel like someone is trying to stalk me lately. Do you think maybe he secretly likes me? In the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. some people become overly sensitive to the gaze of others. Above all, anxiety and mental strain will exponentially rise. There will also be actions to try and withdraw from an interpersonal relationship. These people are called anthropophobes. Dinner's ready. ・～ "When the child tried to grab that golden ring. I had no choice but to let her do it, I mustn't say anything to stop her." "She would fall each time, but I mustn't say a thing to her." "Once the carousel stopped spinning, she'd hopped off the wooden horse and she'd come to me." "I'll be watching you, all I'll be doing is look at you." "I said so to her and gave her some more money." "Here you go, buy some more tickets." "She then took the money and she said, "I'm not angry at you anymore." "I know, now come on, let's go again." "That's when she suddenly..." Kinuko! So it was you? Since when did you start becoming a peeping tom? Oh, occasionally when I skip class to a place like this and hear a girl reading a book, of course I'll peep at her. I didn't expect to see anyone else here during class time. Oh, but I've always been here since last year. Still the same as ever eh. If you keep on skipping class and paint all the time, you'd be held back again y'know. I don't need you worrying about my future. -Here. -Oh, thanks. Anyways, you've seen that Salinger movie right? "Nine and a half weeks of lust between a man and a woman." Now that's just too much. How did you... How did you know I saw that movie? -Was it that damn Kutsugake? -Calm down, no need to be falsely accusing anyone. I was just in the seat right behind you. But you know what though... I really love watching you wear that funeral dress to a movie like that. -Come on, you're so dirty. -God, I love it dirty. Hey, maybe let me paint you naked next time. You'd look great naked. You've got really nice skin, very supple and plump. -Can't you keep it in your imagination? -Wait, I haven't told you before? I've seen you twice on that eastside bathhouse. -The eastside bathhouse? Naked then? -Well, of course. -You don't take a bath with your clothes on, do you? -N-No, of course not. Don't you have your own bathroom in your house? No, we have a bathroom, but I guess I'm the communal bath type. Hold on, don't you live in Omi-cho? -Yup, near the Omi-cho Market. -Then why would come from all the way there... -to the communal bathhouse on the eastside? -Well, not just the eastside bathhouse. You know, I love going to all the public baths. It's fun... Hehe... It's fun. Y-You... You're a damn pervert. Don't stutter. Hey listen. I don't know how many painters there are in the world... Who can't go into the women's bathroom just because they're a man. It might just be an eternal misfortune for them. Just think of the many models they missed, While I can see maybe 10 or 20 beautiful models there. Like that old fisherlady's arms... so strong, so vibrant... or that pregnant woman when she washes her belly. There's no comparisson to that kind of divinity, is there? Hmm... a naked woman is truly a thing of beauty. Women are truly the embodiment of Buddha's mother nature itself. This is pretty out there, isn't it? (School Bell Ringing) "Love is dying, and while love may die, still, it won't come out in the colour of a morning glory." Well, to summarize the meaning of that passage, "I've fallen in love with you. Though I toss and turn, unable to sleep. Even if I should die of hunger for the sake of this love. I would never reveal it to you." -Well, that's about it. -So then... That's pretty much the gist, isn't it? Let's see, I'll pick one of you to do it again next week. I'm sure you'll find a Man'yōshū passage that you'll like. -Sounds good? Hello, class? -Alright... Even when you've found a man you like, you still wouldn't open up to me. And not just when it comes to love, isn't it? But you just wouldn't open up to anything. I guess, you're the "closed off" type after all. Yea, so what? I'm definitely taking you to see my boyfriend. Why... why so sudden? What gave you the idea suddenly? It's for revenge. R-Revenge? W-What wrong have I done to you? Stop stuttering will ya. You know what really scares me? Mundane and ordinary people like you. Living the peaceful lifestyle, no romantic entanglement whatsoever. I'm going to take my revenge on you and your happy-go-lucky life. ・～ This is a bit unfair don't you think? Yea I know, it's a one-sided revenge after all. and I don't blame you for taking it out on me. Welp, anyways I hope you can cope with that. Uhh... I'm not a Dharma y'know. ・～ ・～ ・～ Oh, so he's a lyricist? This is "BOY FRIEND", isn't it? "girl girl" too? and "Girls' Season"? I know all of these. He's quite popular huh. -Used to be. -Hey. Oh, sorry to disturb you. This is my friend, Takako Yoshioka. -Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi. -Nice to meet you. I know all of your songs, Kobayashi-san. -That was a thing of the past. I quit. -Quit? Hiroshi here, is a real "tanka" poet. He won all the awards when he was just a student. Then how did you become a hit songwriter? Well, you can't earn a living doing tanka. I had a friend who ran a record company. "Why don't you give it a go?", he told me. Then his stuff became a big hit and he kept on making hits ever since. All the idol girls would line up just to get a song written by the great Hiroshi Kobayashi. -At least that's how the legend goes, right? -Yup, that's how the legend goes. But why did you quit? Oh, is it because you like writing "tanka" more? Not really, I feel no difference when I'm writing a "tanka" or a song. But isn't that a waste? Aren't music royalties a lot of money? I'll never understand you girls. But you wrote so many beautiful lyrics. If it was as simple as writing words, I could write forever. ・～ He said that he can think of a song as he makes one of his pots. He hasn't been writing songs about other people, has he? Is that why it's so hard for him to write a song about me? You are such a worrier. Pretty cool to imagine you're dating someone like that, you know? When you said we're meeting your boyfriend, I thought he'd just be some high schooler. Like I thought he was going to be some handsome boy who just studies and play sport. As expected from you Teiko. Truly amazing. Hey, what's wrong? (Sigh) Are you a mother? You dumbass. Christ, It's nothing like that. -You know that his family are "Kutani" potters, right? -Right. That's his job right now, but I'm sure Hiroshi will go to Tokyo again someday. Oh come on, you don't even know that. How can you say you're in love with a man, If you don't pay attention to things like that? Don't tell me... You're not following him to Tokyo, are you? Who knows? Ah! (Banging) W-What... What are you doing here all the sudden? Don't stutter will ya, Teiko. Ah... Excuse me, this is my ex-father. -What, father? -Yea. Kanazawa Gakuin University Faculty of Literature's Assistant Professor of Russian Literature, Mikoshiba Toshio, at your service. Ah, I'm Takako Yoshioka. Thank you for Teiko's continuous support. So, what do you want? No way you're here to reinstate your marriage with mom, right? I've come to get my books, Should be on the bookshelf upstairs. -You still got that bookshelf? -Yup, we got it. I've left the study exactly as it was when you left. I see. Ah, mom will be here soon. She probably don't want to caught her divorced husband up there. Especially with their daughter on the same building. Alright, why don't you get the books and I'll stay put. Oh, it's "The Turgenev Collection". Number three, four, and five. Three, four, and five, alrighty. I'll get it for you. -Takako, was it? -Yes. A glass of beer, please. Ah, alright. -Ms. Takako. -Yes? Have you read Turgenev? What? "I never had a first love." He said at the end. "All the sudden I started with a second love." It's "First Love", Ms. Takako. Right, here you go. Thank you very much. I don't mind you visiting, but... if you do come again, please don't come at such a thrilling time. Wait... Dad, come on. This way, this way, this way... Oh, it's already opened. -Hello there. -Welcome, Takako! -Where's Teiko? -Here, I'm here. -What are you doing over there? -Oh, nothing. Huh? Ah... Ah... Ah... Uhm the bathroom. The bathroom's this way right? No, no, no. This way, this way. Oh, that's right, haha. Ah... Mom, mom, mom. Uh, you know uh... I think the lights for the shop sign are out of power. -Oh, is that so? -Yeah. I've been meaning to change those fluorescent tubes, y'know. Ouch… -You sure? -Yeah. Look, it works fine. That's funny, it didn't work earlier. Is that so? -Oh my, there's a book on the floor. -Oh, that's... Isn't this your father's book, what's it doing here? Oh, that's uh... I borrowed it. Yeah, that's it. He's a stupid man, isn't he. "Those who fall in love are weak" "I was sixteen years old then." "It was the summer of 1833." "I was living with my parents in Moscow." "I've forgotten all about her slender figure... The slender base of her neck, her beautiful hands... The slightly dishevelled pale blonde hair of hers peeping out underneath her white platok... With her half-asleep, clever-looking eyes... Her eyelashes and the lustrous cheeks beneath them... I was lustfully starring at her." "You, hey, you!" "Suddenly I heard someone's voice at my side." "Is it right for you to be looking at a girl like that?" You, hey, you! Is it right for you to be looking at a girl like that? Takako... What are you doing outside? Kanzaki-kun? Ah. You know who that was, Hiro-chan? Yeah. You called him, "Kanzaki-Kun", didn't you? I used to tutor him, but he left at the end of the year. Why? Low grades or something? He's been getting great results left and right. No problem at all teaching him, we were on a roll. I think he got accepted to your school last spring. Hmm. Why did he quit then? Was it the tuition fee? He's hardworking, gets good grades, and also from a wealthy family. But his mom died when he was only in primary school. So he's been living alone with his dad. I see, I get it now. The desire for a mother becomes a longing for an older woman. And that longing for an older woman was his first... Well, I guess we all do. But to have people talking about you when you're not there... -It's really unpleasant, isn't it? -Right. Actually, there's this freshman kid who's quite popular. There're rumours going around saying that he likes Taka-senpai. The girls who are crazy for him are even trying to get you, Taka-senpai. That's just ridiculous. You've must've got it all wrong. Yeah, well that's what they all said. He's just that popular. I could understand, if he'd go for someone like Enami Midoriko. But of all people, I don't know why he picked Taka-senpai. What's the matter? You seem very enthusiastic today. Even when you mourn for your broken heart like it's the end of the world. Exams and an empty stomach will still exist. If I keep getting more red marks, I'll just be a beautiful moron. Well you don't get to call yourself a beautiful moron everyday eh? -Oh, no. There's a guy staring at us. -Hmm? Probably just another guy giving you the looks again. Sadly, the focus seems to be on you. Cute guy too. When did you hook up with that cutie? What's he like? He looks pretty new, maybe he's in his freshman year. Looks like a proper growing sprout. Is he still watching? He's still watching. Where is he sitting? Precisely behind you at an angle to the right. Alright... Kanzaki-kun, right? Why were you staring me? I'm sorry, my eyes wandered to you. Well, I don't mind. But honestly, I don't think I'd want to stand in for my sister. You're a female yakuza, aren't you? I'm scared at the fact that we're actually friends. Just because someone stared at you... You don't just go pick a fight with them, alright? What? We know each other. Wasn't I just saying my greetings to him? Well that greeting scared me. Oh, that poor new kid. He's all red-faced and mopey. What were you looking at? Careful on your way home tonight. I just saw his fangirls staring at you. Will you be my bodyguard then? On one hand, I'm annoyed that he's only talking to me about unimportant things. but on the other hand, I'm also happy that he was paying attention to me after all. A woman's mind is a complicated thing. (Art Club Members Talking) Still at it, Oe Kinuko? -We're leaving now, we'll leave the rest to you. -Aight, bye-bye. I mean I like the enthusiasm, but don't keep others waiting. -Huh? -Bye! Hey, when did you get here? I didn't even see you coming. Staring is such a powerful thing isn't it? Huh? The self that looks on and the object that's looked on. and it's like everything else is erased. If I were to become your model, and be stared at by your eyes... Go on... I'd be reminded of how helpless we truly all are. But, before you've even become my model... Someone's already been staring at you, am I right? Huh? Huh? You knew? He and I are in the same class after all. Oh, so he's looking at you because you have your sister's appearance. -Now that's the type of story that would make me tear up. -This is serious, you know? -I'm really scared. -Scared? Why is he staring at me so obediently? Being overly obedient like that is scary, isn't it? Just let him stare at you. Huh? Hmm... Him staring means that he's fallen in love. Well if that's the case, you being stared means... that you're being loved, right? You're too busy about thinking about staring. While you yourself can't even handle being stared at. That's why you're so hesitant to be my model. -That has nothing to do with this. -It does! Now listen to me for a bit, okay? It's not enough for someone to only fall in love, It's also important to be loved as well. To be gazed at by others as you gazed back at them. I want to see you go from being a woman in love to a woman that's loved. I too will secretly wait for you. Okay? Well, I'm outta here, bye-bye. I'm only saying that to get you off my back y'know. After all, you're my favorite. Love you, Takako. Ciao... ♪ (Humming) What the hell are you talking about, that pervy girl? I like the "Yakult" they serve.

Sit facing againts the wall, arms folded, while sitting cross-legged. She said you'd stay in that position until dawn. She told you that? Hiroko... What's wrong with that? I thought it was amazing. Amazing? W-Which part? When you fold your arms and stare at the wall. It's like you're going face to face with yourself. That's not something I can do. I liked Hiroko-sensei. But you and Hiroko-sensei are different. I like Hiroko-sensei. But sometimes I think I might have a crush on you, Takako. I hate to break it to you, but a love that begins with that kind of impression... I don't know, I think it's a bit too careless minded. Is that so? But out of all those girls at school...

While Midoriko's just dancing like crazy at the disco. Midoriko is? The moment you simply said, "I'm in love or I've fallen in love." You'd get carried away way... way too much. Aren't you just letting your feelings get the better of you? Well you... Hey, did you cut your hair? ・～ So you're ready to be stared at by my eyes. Are you cool with it now? Hmm? No, I'm not ready to expose my whole body. Well... -You want a drink? -No, thanks. So what is it this time? I didn't expect you to call me. Hmm? Just a whim. I don't think that's the case. Women are so stupid, aren't they? I wonder what's going on with them. Is it your friends? Love isn't something you should consume or be consumed by. Mhm, you mean like the fish right? I mean, it's only love y'know. -Only? -Yeah. Hold on a minute, Otaka. How can you say that it's "only" love? You actually love your friends. You're just afraid of being left behind, aren't you? Looks like I've hit a bull's-eye judging by the fact that you can't answer that. I just don't want to be eaten alive by love. -That's not it either. -Then what is it? Aversion. Otaka, It's more foolish for women to think based on logic... Rather than it is to think based on love. I'll teach you... Huh? What... What... What's the matter with you? You have to do stupid things to stupid people so they'd understand. Ah! Wait... I'm sorry, but... I'm into that kind of thing. No, wait, wait... Oh, God, besides I haven't bath since yesterday. You're still trying to reason your way out of this at this stage? Stop, what if someone sees us? What are you doing? Hey, hey... I'll blow the logic straight to your head. Wait... Stop... Ah... Stop... Oh, God, that feels so weird. I'm going to fill your head with all my heart. Wait... Wait... Wait... Stop... Wait! C'mon... Wait... Oh no, I'm starting to feel weird. Uh, wait... You're in love with someone, aren't you? Why should I tell you that? He's the reason for this crazy haircut, isn't he? I don't have to answer that. Huh... People like you, who can't even confess their love... Are 10 years too young to be my model. But I like that twisted, passionate side of you. -I can't help it y'know. -Leave me alone! After all I had to endure staying silent. I'd rather pine away and die. (Chuckling) Of course. Well, come to me before you die pining away. I'll paint you with all my might as a remnant for this world. Well, in the meantime, I'd suggest you go to the museum and do some research. Take care of yourself. Bye. Hmm, that could be good. ・～ (Announcer) Masaru Kutsukake from Kanazawa Daiichi High School. "We have a call for you. Please come to the museum reception desk." I can't help it, can't I? Yeah... Yoshioka, why are you here? What are you doing here on your spring break? I'm just here for no reason really. Well, there's also the after-effects of baseball. I'd understand if you were close to losing. That's not funny. We're good, but... I'm sorry for the third years seniors and alumni who came to see me while I was studying for exams. Is that the only way boys can talk? You lose, and you say, "I'm so disappointed!" If you'd just be frank about it, you'd have been so much better. Everything you say works, doesn't it? Y'know they say that men aren't into smart girls. "That's a blow for you, too! Since you got a knack for it, don't you?" But then again... You're the only one in class who ever came to watch me play baseball. I'm grateful for that. Do you like baseball? Oh, I don't know. I went there with a friend who's a die-hard baseball fan. "Forgive me, Kanzaki, for laying it on you." -Oh, the guy you were with. -Mhm. Wasn't that the freshman you threatened in the library? You dating that guy or something? We're just long time acquaintances. "Wow, that's not nice at all!" Kutsukake-kun's girlfriend is from Kaga, right? -Yeah, so you saw her at the stadium? -She's quite a cute girl, isn't she? Someone behind me was just shouting, "Masaru-kun!" She was cheering for you so hard. Anyone would feel really jealous just hearing that. Yeah... It's a problem being in different schools too, y'know? Like today for example, She said, "I can't come today, I suddenly got a class meeting". "What a fool she is!" What does it matter if you guys go to different schools? Like "seriously". But it is a problem, isn't it? "Are you going to open up to me because you're worried about your own love life?" You've known each other for a while, haven't you? Yeah, we went to junior high together. I see. "If you've been together since junior high school, then you're bound to get tired of each other." I'm talking like an idiot, aren't I? Dumbfounded by that. A normal girl would say, "It's okay, don't worry about it." Well, that's Yoshioka for ya. You'd say about anything, don't you? You're like a skilled madam​ who runs an Okiya whore house. "What a thing to say. Truly a woman's tragedy." See ya. That one's set for Teramachi, you know that? Are you sure? ・～ I don't care where I go, as long as I'm away from you. I can say about anything to you, because I'm not your girlfriend. I'm not going to listen to any more of this nonsense about misunderstandings between lovers. He even called me a brothel madam​ who runs an Okiya whore house. ・～ ・～ Sorry to barge in on you when you're so busy. No, don't worry about it. But why here all the sudden by yourself? I wrote a tanka and I thought you could read it. "My dear, I've been told of your love's woes, and how sad you are. To whom shall you tell?" Is there someone you love? A breakup. Prior to a breakup. Prior? There are so many men around me, But to choose just one of them... I'm not sure what it is. Why should it be him, not someone else? There are so many people who are nicer, better looking and smarter than him. Why... Why only one person, of all the others... Is he the only one? I don't even know... Am I in love or have I fallen in love... I can't tell. Yes, this is Kobayashi. What is it, Ippei? I'm heading back to Tokyo. But I'm not writing anymore. No, I'm serious. I won't write anymore, no matter how much you ask. Your phone number? Has it changed? Yeah, okay, okay. I'll write it down. Wait a minute. Hey, are you okay? -"Hello?" -Hey! (Hang Up Sound) (Laughing) Trying to scare me are you? (Disconnected Telephone Noise) Oh, no. What was that suddenly? Revenge. To whom? To Teiko? Midoriko? No, not that. It's more than that. -Yeah, for Hiroshi-san too. -For me? You treated Teiko and the rest of us like children. No, I didn't mean for it to be that way. No, you're wrong. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to write so many songs about girls. We may be immature... When it comes to love. But I think our feelings for others are the same as those of adults No, I think it's more than that. You should realise that, Hiroshi-san. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to come here and say this. I'll be going. You... Takako. Thank you. ・～ ♪～ ♪～ ♪～ Glad you came, my beloved sister. -You only love me at times like this. -Oh, don't say that. I also have to leave here at 8 o'clock for other reasons. 8... It's because we're supposed to be doing this damn errand until 11:00, isn't it? ♪～ ♪～ Why would you go back to the hot spring inn in the mountains after graduating from university? Only Hiro-chan would do that, right? Not really. You know some people would go to Tokyo in this day and age. I had no choice but to come back, I promised them. I was allowed to come to Kanazawa University for only four years. From having an "Omiai", to becoming a hostess for the hot spring inn... It just doesn't suit you, Hiro-chan! Don't say that, second daughter. The eldest daughter has her own logic. Well, I'll leave you to it. Yeah. ♪～ Hiro-chan, w-wa... Hiro-chan, you smoke? Thank you. Sorry to keep you waiting. Here you go, Sorry to keep you waiting. We've run out of ingredients. (Female Students Talking) Hey, if it isn't Takako. Midoriko! What are you... I'm surprised you came all this way. He's a sophomore here. -If Aki-bou knew, he'd be really pissed. -Leave me alone, will ya. ♪～ ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ I'm going home. Kana... -No! -No? What do you mean "no"?. -Well, I don't get it. -I'm going home. I don't get it if you don't make it clear. -No, isn't that enough? -That's not good enough. I'm leaving. Alright, enough of that. ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ What's the matter Takako? Why were you looking for me through the window? It's all too good for a coincidence. Haven't I told you before? I'm fixed on you naturally. Zaki... If you were to hug me right now, I wouldn't resist. Takako, I don't know what happened to you, but... It's not fair to just talk like that. I've had the most perfect heartbreak tonight. Breakup? I knew you were with that guy all along, Takako. So there's nothing to it. I too will be apart of that chain reaction of heartbreak. That's my dad. Hiroko-sensei... Hold up... ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ Hiro-chan... Well, I'm not going to kill myself over a broken heart either. Were you suggesting that I was gonna kill myself? If I told you, would you do it? I'm not gonna give up on life, at least not yet. I'm going home. Thanks. No problem. You can return it anytime you want. It's not for that. But for liking me. You're welcome. ・～ ・～ ・～ Takako-chan! I finally found you. I've been looking all over the gymnasium for you. -What is it? -It's your friend Midoriko... Aki-bou and his friends are in trouble, they're duelling Duelling? ・～ ・～ ・～ Wait, Midoriko! Stop them, please. No, those two are totally in the mood to be knights and gunslingers. That's being irresponsible. Both sides are going in full speed... The first person to swerve, loses. Oh, crap. If you both are really stubborn... It's going to be a head-on collision. You... It's going to be a real funeral, you know that? We've come this far. There's no stopping it. I've made up my mind and I'm watching men duel. Why don't you go scream, "gyah-gyah-wa-wa". Damn it, I'm not a TV series heroine anymore. I'm gonna scream, "gyah-gyah-wa-wa"! Gyah-gyah-wa-wa! (Screaming Continues) Dumbass. ・～ Aki-bou! Toru! Toru! Toru! Hey, Toru! Are you okay? Hey! Hey, the helmet, helmet. Hey, you alright? (Coughing) (Erina and Her Friends Cheering) The panties, the report card... All I had to do was bury them and I was clean. But that's not how it works with a broken heart. But... Hmm? But? I saw the motorbike duel and I thought... Isn't it nice to have such a simple and noble way to defend one's love? I guess so... Well, as long as we don't crash. I finally figured it out. There are no conditions for love. Conditions? What are you talking about? Love for marriage, love for family... Love for rank and status, and love for money. There's also love for a Ryokan inn. Yeah, we all have that someone we think of... And we're in love with just by looking at them. That's why I think it's okay for my broken heart... Along with my report card and my humiliated panties... To be buried together. My feelings for that person before and after the breakup... Doesn't change even by a gram, I can definitely say that! What was that? That was awfully realistic the way you said it. You've had your heart broken, haven't you? Maybe someday... We might have to fall in love with someone conditionally. And when we do, maybe a white cross won't be enough anymore. But until then, I'll keep burying them with my white crosses. Do as you please! Takako, have you just come back? Are you up already? I just woke up. I'm going to bed now, so don't wake me till noon. -Alright, good night. -Good night. Thanks for last night. Yeah. ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ ・～ How is your tea? It is excellent. ・～ ・～ ・～ Don't fuck with us girls! What the hell are you doing, Teiko? It's "Kutani" ware, isn't it? It's worth 200,000 yen. Oh... ・～ When was the last time the three of us had a field meeting like this? In the autumn of our first year, at Kenrokuen, wasn't it? Oh yeah, that time, there was that kid. He crawled up on the carpet, right? (Laughs) He came up here with muddy boots on. Takako got so pissed. Of course I did, it's a sacred tea ceremony. What was it? He started singing "Ninja Hattori" or "Doraemon" or something. Things got worse when he started doing those workout excersises from "Okaasan to Issho​". Hey, do you remember what that kid said that time? "When I was in my mother's tummy... And she was about to give birth, I tapped her tummy... and asked, "Can I come out?" My mother answered, "Yes, it's okay." I said, "Hello" as I came out." He said. I said, "Stupid parents, teaching such things to kids who don't know what they're talking about." But Midoriko said, "You're a clever boy to be able to say that as a 3 year old." Takako, do you remember what you said to him? I don't remember. I was upset. "Wouldn't it be nice if people were born that way?" Was what you said, romanticizing all by yourself. But even the ramblings of that one kid... Could show the personality in all three of us. "Yes that's right, I did say that." "And I still think that way." "Someone congratulating me on my birth with open arms, saying that it's okay." "They're waiting for me." "Then I would greet them, "Hello"... "It's a simple, beautiful, and yet very social word." "What a wonderful thing it would be if I were to be born with it as my first word." ・～ ・～ "That's all I thought I'd tell you" "Just a few words about what happened afterwards." "On the last day of March, Hiroko packed her bags and went back to Hakusan Mountain." "I'm the only one who lives on the second floor of the Ryokan Association building now." "Teiko is still sitting in the dining room with a copy of "Monthly Tanka" in her hand, chewing on an onigiri." "Hiroshi-san's name hasn't appeared on the list of winners of the tanka award yet." "Midoriko held her fourth funeral the day she learned Tatsuo had a child seven months after his marriage." "Kinuko, in spite of all the times she skipped class... she was able to avoid being held back for the second time and became a sophomore." "It was later counted as one of the Seven Wonders of Kanazawa Daiichi High School." "For the sake of Kinuko, I finally made up my mind to take my clothes off." "It took her a month to finish the painting." "Right now my painting is displayed on an art exhibition for the school festival in November." "I'm imagining Masaru Kutsukake pausing in front of my nude painting in No. 50, getting off to it." "If that happens, I'll be satisfied." "I have a feeling I could just walk up to him and say, "I love you." ・ MAY don't be so pouty. ・ Let me see your smiling face. ・ Be playful like you always are. ・～ ・ MAY don't be so pouty. ・ I can't say a single word about it. ・ And it annoys me. ・ Even now, even though you're hurting ・ I can think of a hundred words of comfort, but... ・ I can't say any of them! ・ I'll pretend I'm looking at a rainbow in a fountain. ・ "It's beautiful, isn't it?" That's all I can say. ・ You think I'm shy... ・～ ・ But I can't say it. ・ You've put a spell on me. ・ In this secret garden. ・ Every word is a lie. ・～
