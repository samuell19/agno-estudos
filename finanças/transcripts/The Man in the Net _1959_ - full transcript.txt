[suspenseful music] [cheerful music] [children shouting] [Timmie] Olly olly oxen free! -[Buck] You didn't even find us. -[Leroy] You're it again. [Emily] Oh, that's a dopey game. [Timmie] Buck, I had a good place. Did you see me? -Where were you? -You didn't even see me. I knocked the scab off my knee again. Look at this. My father says I'm gonna have scabby knees for the rest of my life. John, why do you paint? Honey, you ask too many hard questions. I guess because I love it. My mother says your paintings are dirty. She hasn't even seen them, but that's what she says. Everybody in town says that. Oh... -Do you think this is dirty? -[Emily] Nuh-uh. -[John] Do you, Leroy? -Nuh-uh. [John] Timmie? No. Neither do I. What do you call it? "Angels in the Wood." Let's go swimmin'. No, I've got to be getting back. Ah, come on. That's no fair. You said you were going swimming with us. -You promised. -We'll go tomorrow. I've got scabs all over these woods, and I believe trees are starting to grow out of 'em. Blood like that makes my mother nauseated. Here, Emily. Come here. Now if you live until tomorrow, you give this handkerchief back. -Do you understand? -All right. Right. Come on, Emily. Here, you take this. -Want me to walk with you? -Of course. Why do you like to be with us so much? Because I think you're the nicest people in the world. Hey, the blood came right through the handkerchief. -We'll getcha a purple heart. -[groans] [car engine rumbles] [suspenseful music] Your face changed as the car went by. Just for a second, it got kind of sad. Did it? Well, I'll see you tomorrow, kids. Ten-thirty at the creek. Deal? Ten-thirty at the creek. A deal. [door creaks] [ominous music] [sultry music] [door opens] [gasps] Well, you came in quiet as a pussy cat. Where'd you ever learn a thing like that? Hello, Steve. In case you're wondering, Linda's upstairs making herself beautiful. Oh, I just stopped in to say hello. I'm the neighborly type. ["Symphony No.4 in E minor" by Brahms] Don't it drive you nuts, all that music? Boy, oh, boy. What a collection. You must have a couple of hundred here. "Calm Sea" and "Prosperous Voyage," by Mendelssohn. What is this, some kind of symphony or somethin'? It's a sailor's hornpipe. [laughs] Yeah, yeah. Boy, John, you're a card. I heard you had a big art show in New York last week. -Didn't do so well, I hear. -Yeah, that's right. Ah, don't let it get you down. Money isn't everything. You got your health, and a couple of bucks to buy your wife a new dress every so often. What more can a man ask? That's right. Well, here's the beautiful Mrs. Hamilton. Steve, darling. You're an angel for waiting. I absolutely have to have a shower when I make that drive back from Marshaltown. If I didn't, I think I'd go and die a horrible death. It was sweet of you to drop by. I thought it was about time for me to have a cold beer, Linda. John didn't offer me any. I guess he don't appreciate my drivin' around in the hot sun, protecting his life and property. Well, are you back already, darling? I thought you'd still be out in the woods playing your lovely games with the children. John Just loves those kids. Your son, Buck, and all the rest of 'em. You know, I really think Stoneville ought to elect him the Scout Master. Linda, there was a roll of tape in here, where is it? Well, I don't know, darling. I haven't seen it. You're sure you wouldn't like a cold drink, Steve? Maybe some other time, Linda? -I'll walk you to the door then. -Fine. Next time you'll be entitled -to two beers. -Ha, ha. You will come again soon, won't you? [Steve] Sure, sure. If you think it's all right. [Linda] Well, of course. We're not snooty. We're just a struggling young artist and his wife. Bye-bye. [sighs] These poor, dear, boring country clods. I'm so glad you were here, darling, I never know what to say to Steve. He's like a big, stupid bear. Half the time I'm afraid he's going to hit me. He thought you were charming. You don't know what an effort it is. At least I made it. You could of been a little less rude to him. It doesn't matter. Oh. yes, it does. It matters a great deal. That's why people like the Morelands and the Careys don't like you. I don't ask them to like me. Where's the... [music swells] John, do you have to split my eardrums with that insane Beethoven thing? It's Brahms, dear. I'm sorry. [music ends abruptly] [Linda] You'd better get ready. We have to be at Vickie's party by eight. [exhales] Look, John. Look. Do you like my new hair? Very much. I think it's kinda nice for a change. I went over to that... Mademoiselle Helen's in Marshaltown. They have a new girl. She said she found some gray hairs. She wanted to touch them up. Can you see them, darling? I swear I can't. Huh? That girl should be fired. [chuckles] You're too sweet to notice. She said she found them, though. Not many, just a few. Oh, well, lots of women are gray before they're 25. [John] You're 28, Linda. Twenty-eight isn't old. The sun bleaches out my hair in the summertime. [drawer opens] There's no need for you to take that away from me. -No, there isn't. -Well, then why do you do it? Don't treat me like an infant child, John. I haven't had a drink in months. I know you haven't. You've behaved beautifully. Listen, I have enough to put up with around here without you patronizing me. You're my husband, not my minister. [bottle slams on table] I'm sorry, John. I don't know why I say things like that. I don't mean them. Honestly, I don't. It's okay. Nobody was hurt. Oh, I... got a letter from Charlie Raines this morning. Charlie Raines? You showed me all the mail, why didn't you show me that? Well, I wanted time to think about it. Why? What does he say? Well, he wants me to come back as head of the art department. "You're still considered by us as one of the most outstanding men in the field. We're looking desperately for someone who can swing the job of Head of the Art Department, a first-rate commercial artist. The salary we are prepared to offer..." Thirty thousand dollars a year! Well, that's twice what you were making before. That's right. You're not going back. You've already decided. Not unless we're starving, we're not. There's no sense talking about it. You've already decided. Linda, I know I can paint. I don't care what a couple of critics said. If I go back to that agency, I'd be working 24 hours a day. We both decided to give up the rat race in New York. We both decided it. Both of us? Are you out of your mind? That New York rat race, as you call it, was my whole life. There hasn't been one hour, starting with the day we moved here, ten months ago, that I haven't prayed to God to get back to it. To the kind of life I know how to live. What do I do here all day? I sit and stare out at those filthy woods while you're off painting your dreary paintings that nobody wants to buy. Or playing this miserable phonograph. Or chasing those runny-nosed kids through the bushes like a frustrated father. I hate them. I hate Stoneville. I hated moving here. I hate this town. I hate every damn provincial country cousin for miles in all directions! That won't help, Linda. You saint! You're so damn good. You'll come over to me now, and you'll say you understand, won't you? You'll say that I had a drink in Marshaltown because some idiot girl said some idiot thing about my hair. Well, it's not true. I haven't had a drink in months. There was never a time in my life when I ever had more than a couple... Oh, John help me. In the name of God, help me. Linda... We can't go back to New York, that's where you got sick, remember? [sobs] I get so scared. If you'd only see Dr. Allister. Just talk to him. No. No. You can't make me go to a psychiatrist. You can't have them lock me up somewhere. He wouldn't do that. Bill's a friend of ours. No, I... I don't want to talk about it. Please, look, I'm fine now. See, I'm fine. You're right, I had one drink, but only one. I swear it. It's just springing it like that on me. It's not easy. I know we're better off here, John. I know it. Well, you'd better get ready if you're going to the party. Me? Aren't you going? No. I couldn't possibly. Not now. -Why not? -Well, I'm just too upset to go, darling. Please, you go. -No. -Oh John, please. It's Vickie's birthday. And we've bought our present and everything. Linda, I don't like these people and they don't like me. I'm not witty and clever. They're not my kind. Well, they're my kind. They're the only thing that's keeping me alive here. You just... you just can't destroy that for me, simply because you resent their money. Please, darling, tell them I have a migraine or something. All right, Linda. Thank you, darling. See, I even put your name on the card, too. Give Vickie my love. Give them all my love and tell her how terribly sorry I am. Well, I think I'll go upstairs and lie down for a while. [crickets chirping] John. Hey, John! We all went swimming, and I stayed under the water a minute and twelve seconds. Who timed it? Nobody. I Just know how long I stayed under. Good evening, Mr. Hamilton. Leroy, you take that bike around the back way. Don't you know what time it is? -Ah, Dad... -[Alonso] Scat now. Won't you come in, sir? Mrs. Hamilton not with you tonight? -No. -Oh, what a shame. And a birthday party, too. May I help you? No thank you. [indistinct chatter] [Roz] Please congratulate her. So glad you like it. We brought it all the way from Sicily. [mixed chatter] -Absolutely you, Vic. -Excuse me, dear. John, how nice to see you. Where's Linda? She has a migraine. She asked me to apologize for her. Oh, I'm sorry. Happy birthday. Don't say that. I'm supposed to hate them all from now on. -Mr. Moreland. -John. -Why so formal? -How are you? I'm fine. How are you, Mrs. Moreland? Oh, Mr. Hamilton, how good of you to come. -Won't you join us? -Thank you. Roz, have you mixed all these up? -[Roz] I don't think so. -[Brad] John... [John] Oh, hello, Brad. -How are you? -Fine. -Where's Linda? -Linda can't come, Brad. Oh, that's a shame. I had her special tomato juice all set for her. Excuse me. Here's your martini. Mixed by loving hands to the fabulous Carey formula. Eight to one. Come along, Mr. Hamilton. [chuckles] Well, young man. I hear your show wasn't exactly a major event in the art field. Look, Dad, I don't think there's any reason for you-- Vickie, I've reached the age where I can be as rude as I like. Isn't that right, John? I guess so. I discovered a long time ago that you have to have the talent to do whatever you set out to do. I haven't figured out what Brad's talent is yet. But we'll probably find it one day, won't we, boy? I don't think this is the time for that. Brad, please. Now, don't try to prove how sensitive you are. Ah, John, could I get you a drink? -No, thank you. -[Gordon] Attention everybody. The fabulous Morelands will now show color slides of their European trip. Oh, look at this shot of Rome. Isn't it divine? [Gordon] And this is the hill outside Palermo, where Roz and I sat and finished the last chapter -of our brilliant novel. -John. This is lovely. Thank you very much. Linda picked it out. I'm sorry she couldn't come. I know it's not easy for you to be here alone. You know, it's not easy for me, sometimes. I often feel like I'm being drowned in an ocean of silly talk. Dinner's served. -Good night. -[Gordon] Shall we? John, please. [Gordon] Let's talk about Greece. I could talk for weeks. [indistinct chatter] -[Roz] Happy birthday, darling. -[applause] [crickets chirping] -Good evening, Mrs. Hamilton. -Alonso. Where is everybody? Surprise, surprise. It's only me, sit down. Happy birthday, Vickie. -Happy, happy birthday. -Why did you walk all the way? Why didn't you phone? Brad would of... would of called for you. Linda. But of course I walked, darling. I walked all the way through those lovely woods. It was absolutely divine. Besides, I had to come. I just had to. -Let me get you a drink. -[John] No, please. Besides, I decided it was just too childish to stay at home -simply because-- -What about your migraine? Migraine? Is that what you told them? I might of guessed it. You always were a bear for proprieties, weren't you, darling? Well, I don't have a migraine at all. As a matter of fact, I never felt better in my life. You might as well know it. John and I've had battle. He didn't mean to do it, really. It just happened. It could've happened to anyone. Poor darling, a second later he was apologizing. But we decided it was better that I stay home. After all, it isn't exactly the height of propriety to come to a Carey birthday party with a shiner. [laughs] Let's get this straight, my dear. You say you had a fight and he hit you? Dad, everyone quarrels. It's not our business. It certainly is our business, if she's in trouble. John, darling. Don't be angry with me for coming. And I just had to wish Vickie a happy birthday. I just had to. -You're going home. -Home? Darling, I only just arrived. I'm so sorry, my dear. Oh, Mrs. Carey, really, it's all my fault, I'm the one to blame. Really. Well, you might as well hear it all. We have no secrets from our dearest friends. Darlings, this is the great drama in the Hamilton household. John was offered his old job back at double the salary. Thirty thousand dollars a year, plus bonuses. And he's going to New York tomorrow and turn it down. So, there it is. It's a simple as that. You see? It's just that I'm so tired of scrimping and saving, and... well, being poor. The idea of going to New York again and to be able to live decently. The way you people live here. But that's just me. I'm being selfish and mercenary. It's John's life that matters. I know that. John has to paint. I know that. No matter what the critics say. I mustn't complain! Could I please have a drink? I was a fool to come here. I didn't really intend to, I'm sorry. I'm a monster to spoil your beautiful birthday party. Perhaps you'd better let John take you home. I should've stayed home. It's just that I was so depressed, and.. and my face hurt. So I took a drink. That's it. That's what's the matter with me. [giggles] I'm stinkin' drunk. You've had your say, now come on, go home. Oh, yes of course, darling. I'm sorry. Yes, of course. I've spoiled your beautiful birthday party. I don't know what to say. Thank you, Gordon. Always a gentleman. Oh. I'll go home now. Oh... I'll wait for you in the car, John. Oh, what a pity. That poor child. Good night. John, wait. We'll see you to the door. -Brad. -[Mr. Carey] Brad... you stay right where you are. John's our guest. [Mr. Carey] Brad. [John] You didn't have to do that, Vickie. Brad can't help behaving as he does, John. It's just that his father... Well, it's like half of him belongs to me and the other half belongs to his father. You going to turn down the New York offer? Yes, I am. Don't let them worry you. It's not their business what you and Linda do. Thanks so much. Good night. John... will you call us if you need us? We're very fond of you... and Linda. Thank you. Good night. [engine starts] Yom can open your eyes now. We're home. [melancholic music] [door slams] [door opens] You mad at me? Well, why don't you say something? Like what, Linda? Like why did I go there? It doesn't matter. Oh, I'll make it all right tomorrow. I promise. I'll tell them I lied about you hitting me. Look, I decided to go. I was running through the woods and I fell down. I had to say something. Everybody has fights. They know that. I don't see why you're being so absurd about this, I said I'd tell them tomorrow. I don't care about them. -John, um... -Please go to bed, Linda. Listen, I want to talk to you. I have something to tell you. I... -I called Charlie Raines. -You what? I told him you had to go out, but that you were very excited about his letter. And you asked me to call him and make a date for tomorrow. You're to meet him at four o'clock at the Endicott Room for cocktails. Just the two of you. Just to talk things over. If you take the 10:58, you'll be there in plenty of time. You did that? Well, darling, one of us has got to be sensible. John, I understand about your pride. I know you'd rather die than admit that the critics were right. But you must know by now that it hasn't worked. You're just not going to be a painter. You haven't got it in you. Now, that's nothing to be ashamed of. But I just can't stand by and see you ruin the only good chance-- Now you don't have to explain to the Careys. That makes your lie the truth. [whimpering] John. John, please. You can't squeeze me into any shape you like. You don't need a husband, you need something to wipe your feet on. [grunts] No, John. No, that's not true. Please go and see him, please. We've got to go to New York. New York is where you got sick. Where you started to drink. Where you had your breakdown. I'm not sick. Listen, John. Help me, please. We've got to go to New York, I can't stay here anymore. Listen, it's... it's Steve. It's Steve Ritter. I've been having an affair with Steve Ritter. I didn't want to tell you. But I tried to tell you several times. I was so ashamed. He'd come swaggering in here, like he did today, when you were out. I didn't want him, John. I swear before God, I didn't want him. But he was too powerful for me. It's like a disease, John. You've got to get me out of here. Don't you hear what I'm saying? I hear what you're saying. -You'll go see Dr. Allister. -No. You're going to Dr. Allister and do as he says. Those are my terms. Because once I loved you. Now I pity you. I am not sick. There's nothing the matter with me. It's you, you! You're distorting everything and trying to make me seem like I'm sick. Listen, John, what I just told you about Steve... I don't believe you about Steve. You don't believe me. [nervous laughter] Oh, that's funny. Oh, that's really funny. That makes me feel like falling down laughing. Linda... you're going to a doctor, Linda, or we're through. I'll do anything you say. [gasps] Only don't let me be alone. Please, please, please. John... could I have just one small drink? [moans] [inaudible] Here's your mail, Mrs. Hamilton. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. Linda! -Oh. -Where are you going? Oh, I was just going to walk home. Well, let me drive you. All right, but I'd like to stop by the Roadside Inn first. Fine. [car starts] [car engine rumbles] Oh! You're up. You know, I couldn't sleep, so I walked into town to pick up the mail. I walked all the way back. -You did? -Oh, yes. It's a beautiful day, John. Really beautiful. There's nothing important here. Well... are you going to New York? -That's why I packed the bag. -[sighs] When do you think you'll be coming back? Tomorrow afternoon. John, listen, I'm very sorry about last night. Really I am. So am I, Linda. Well, I got to be leaving. Brad called while you were asleep. He's taking the 10:58, too, He said he'd meet you there. -Oh? -Yes. Listen, what train do you think you're going to come back on tomorrow? -The 12:42. -Oh. [birds chirping] John... See you tomorrow. John, listen, I haven't had a drink today. I know you haven't. Look, if Dr. Allister isn't there, promise me you won't go to anyone else. I swear I'll do what Bill says, but no one else, please. All right, Linda. Want to drive me to the station? No, I don't want to be seen like this. Besides, I won't need the car. Listen... I lied to you last night about Steve. I don't know what got into me. I... I just... I'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye. Goodbye, then. [bell ringing] -Good morning, John. -Good morning. Linda told me you'd be on the 10:58. Say, I'm sorry about last night. My father is a little peculiar. He gets over-excited sometimes. The self-made man, you know. Ah, Linda'll be fine. She's like every other female in this world. A little hard to figure out sometimes, that's all. Maybe so. You still planning to turn that job down? Yes, I am. Well, I guess you know best. Say, if you're planning to stay overnight in town tonight, you're welcome to come over to the hotel and stay with me. I'll put you in on the expense account. Thanks. I might do that. We can... keep each other out of trouble. [indistinct chatter] No, no, Charlie. All right, all right I'm not going to try to sell you on coming back to Raines and Raines. But we're breaking new ground there. I mean, really booming, you know. And we'd love to have you. But you're the boy who has to fling the whole idea down the well to see how high it splashes for you. [chuckles] I don't know, they tell me I'm supposed to say those things. It's a... Madison Avenue custom or something. It's all very colorful, Charlie. But no thanks, anyway. I just can't see myself coming back. Sure, I understand. But Linda was so enthusiastic on the phone. I thought-- Linda is always eager. Yeah, that's a woman for you. God bless her. Johnny, I certainly wish you'd reconsider. No, Charlie. My check please. Sorry I'm late. Oh, hello, Brad. Mr. Raines, Mr. Carey. -Glad to know you. -How do you do? Well, I have to rush away. I'll see you, Johnny. -Goodbye. -Bye. Very dry Martini, please. [sighs] What a day. Excuse me. Since when are you drinking doubles? Telephone for you, Mr. Carey. Oh, thank you. Hello? No. Dr. Allister is on his vacation. He's been in Canada on a hunting trip for quite some time. He won't be back for another two weeks. Oh, thank you. Would you care to see Dr. Bolton? He's looking after Dr. Allister's patients. No, thank you. [phone rings] Hello, Dr. Allister's office. [bell ringing] [dramatic music] Linda. Linda! Linda! Linda. Linda. Linda. Linda! Linda! [music swells] [sniffs] Three-two-O. [panting] Hello, Vickie. Vickie, is Linda there? No, as a matter of fact, I was just going to call her. I haven't seen her since the other night. She's probably in town shopping or something. No, I have the car. Something's happened. Well, John, maybe she's nearby, just waiting for you to ask her to come home. Has Steve Ritter called? Anything wrong? No he hasn't. Will you care the Morelands and the Careys? I'd rather not, after the other night. [Vickie] Surely, John. I'll call right now. Thank you, Vickie. [phone rings] -Hello? -Hello, John? This is Gordon Moreland. Is Linda with you? Well, do you know where she is? Well, I've just been down to the village dump. I think you'd better get down there right away. Village dump? We found some of Linda's clothes there. Better hurry, John. -[phone hangs up] -Gordon? Gordon? Gordon? We found it, me and Buck. We were on the war path and we saw smoke signals, and then... there it was. Just lying there. We found it, me and Buck. -So we telephoned my father. -Hello, John. Sorry to get you down here like this, John, but we thought maybe you could help us. The kids found it and Mr. Moreland called me and thought maybe I could help. Well, we're pretty sure what it is. What we'd like to know is how it got here. That's Linda's new dress-- This is none of our business Roz. At the moment, Steve is the proper authority. Yes, but why would she throw it out on a dump? Especially a new dress. Absolutely absurd. Of course she wouldn't. What about it, John? Can you identify this suitcase and everything? Yes. This is hers. But I don't know where she is. -[Roz] You don't know? -Roz. What do you mean John? I was in New York yesterday. I just got back here three quarters of an hour ago, and she left me a note. We we're watching all over. That's how I found the suitcase. Look... Mrs. Moreland, would you take the kids home, huh? Not me, boy. I'm staying right here. Steve, you don't think that Linda could've been-- For heaven's sake, relax. Look, Buck. Tell Mom I'm gonna be a little late, huh? -You go with Mrs. Moreland. -Oh, Pop. You want a swat in the head? I'm gonna give you one. Please, I want to stay. -You too. Off. -If you need me as a witness or anything, Steve. Buck, Timmie. [Buck] Ah, come on, come on, we want to stay. We found it. Come on, aw... We wanna stay. Well, we'd better search the dump. Those kids have been over it pretty thoroughly. [engine starts] [car driving away] Maybe she went to New York, John. No, she had no friends there, really. That's nonsense. She's got dozens of friends there. She's always talking about them. -What about her folks? -None at all. Oh, it looks like she just walked right out into the blue, don't it, John? That's right. Maybe she did it just to give you a scare, huh, John? -Maybe. -It can't be that simple. Something's happened to her. I don't think there's any question about it. Ah, probably not. Well, there's nothing here. I guess I'm gonna have to call the State Troopers. I'm okay when it comes to checking church doors to see if they're locked, but this is pretty serious. It's okay with you, John, if I call Captain Greene? -It's okay. -All right, we'd better go up and have a look at your house, huh? Let's go. Give me Captain Greene, please. Your wife do this? I guess so. She sure musta been burning, John. All these gorgeous paintings. Steve tells me that she left you a note, may I see it? Yes, you can. Here you are. [inaudible] "Get yourself another woman to torture." Take a look around the place. Check the whole house. She feels that you've been treating her pretty badly, right? -That's exaggerated. She's sick. -She's sick? Yes, she's an alcoholic. Hold it. Wait a minute, John. Linda an alcoholic? Well, you know better than that. What, you tryin' to kid the Captain or something? Linda don't drink at all. I didn't want anybody to know. That's why we moved here. Well, what do you know. Linda an alky. Wonders never cease, do they? Okay. All right, she's a drunk. But she is gone. Steve tells me you had a battle with your wife the other night. What was it about? About a job I didn't take. -Job? You're a painter, right? -That's right. What kind of a job was it? Head of the Art Department at an agency. -How much did the job pay? -Thirty thousand. A woman doesn't have to be an alcoholic to get steamed up over that, does she, Steve? There were other complications. -She got mad, didn't she? -Yes, she did. Nothing very complicated about that. John went to New York yesterday. He Just got back. Was that to turn down the job? Yes it was. -What train did you take? -[John] The 10:58. Did your wife know why you were going? Yes. I was gonna see a psychiatrist... for her. A psychiatrist? You turn down $30,000, and you were gonna take her to a psychiatrist? You're teasing me, Mr. Hamilton. My wife has been sick for a long time. Ah, cut it out, John. Aren't you forgetting something? I know Linda. Why don't you shut up! Go ahead, John. You go first. All right. Settle down here. -What a mess. -[Steve] Sure is. All right. Now what about your sick wife? She was gonna see a psychiatrist, Dr. Allister. Did you talk to this Dr. Allister while you were in New York? No. He was on vacation. Well, didn't you even check to see first? -No, I didn't. -Was there another women? No, there wasn't. -Well, what'd you find? -Nothing much, Captain. Found this in the linen closet. And this card on the bathroom floor. I guess it's nothing, sir. [Greene] "Dear John, This is the life. No patients, no calls, no hospital duties. Why don't you drop those paint brushes and fly up here for a few days? Best to Linda. Bill Allister." Bill Allister. That's the psychiatrist, isn't it? Yes. This is postmarked six days ago. Lake Louise, Canada. You got this card before you went to New York. You knew that doctor wouldn't even be there, didn't you? No, I never saw the card. Do you always keep your typewriter there, under the stairs? -No. -Where do you keep it? In the barn. In my studio. This note, your wife typed it, didn't she? -Yes. -No signature. Nothing. Just typed. -That's right. -She do a lot of typing? Not very much. And yet she lugged the typewriter all the way in here to type the note. Why didn't she use a pen? That would've been the simplest thing, wouldn't it? If you think I typed that, you're wrong. -Captain Greene. -Yep. I found these out back, stuffed under a pile of half-burned leaves. Oh, somebody's blue jeans. Look at all those pretty paint colors. Blue, green, yellow. Just like artists use. Who'd be burning blue jeans on your property, Mr. Hamilton? -I don't know. -You know something? They look like they're about your size, John. Maybe you oughta try 'em on, huh? They're mine. I haven't seen 'em in a couple of days. You have no idea how they got there? -No. -Or who burned them? No. You don't think there might be a teeny speck of blood or something on them, do you Captain? Naw, I doubt it, Linda'll probably show up. You don't think she's dead or anything do you, John? -Where's your wife, mister? -I don't know. How did her suitcase get on the dump? I don't know. Did you type that note? No. I told you before, I didn't. -Did you tear up the room? -No. -Did you hide the gin bottle? -No. -Did you burn those blue jeans? -No! All right, Steve, you can give me her description for the teletype. Nothing comes in by tomorrow, fan out search parties over the area. Drag the lake, if necessary. You know the deal. Get as many volunteers as you need. There'll be no shortage, Captain. Get out! Get out, both of you. Before we start going through all this hullabaloo, would you like to tell us what you did with your wife? Yeah, give us a break, John-boy. You don't want to see us overworked or anything, do you? What did you do with Linda before you went to New York to set up your alibi? [grunts] -Why you...! -Cut it out! Settle down, Steve. You've got a pretty good right hand for a painter, John. You shouldn't have done that, Mr. Hamilton. Stay near your house. We'll be in touch. [suspenseful music] [Linda] John, I understand about your pride. I know you'd rather die than admit what the critics say is true. But you should know it by now. You're not going to be a painter. You just haven't got it in you. You can't make it. John! John? John! John! John! Vickie, what are you doing here? I came to drive you back to our house with me. John, you've got to get out of here. The news about your blue jeans and Linda's note is all over town. Everyone's saying that you've done something to her. They're gathering in the street in front of the post office. Steve Ritter's the worst of them all. He's causing all the hysteria. Why is he so against you, John? I don't know. I was afraid they might hurt you. I've done nothing... nothing to run from. Do you think she's dead? I'm not sure. Well, they're saying she is. They're saying no one saw her or spoke to her from the time you and she left my party the other night. Gordon's told them that you had over 12 hours alone with her before you took the train to New York with Brad. Why is Gordon so interested? Well, he thinks you killed her. Do you? No. You don't seem to be too sure. [sighs] I want to be, John. Well, it's just that there's so much. I mean, you told them Linda was an alcoholic and needed a psychiatrist badly. I've been her friend for over a year. These things are so hard to believe. I tried to keep it from everybody. I believe you, John. I can imagine what your life's been like. Whatever happens, or... whatever may have happened, I'm with you. -Good night, John. -Thank you, Vickie. [indistinct chatter] Yeah, I know. But it isn't State Troopers' business. It's Stoneville's business. You said it, Eddie. He killed her. There's no doubt in my mind. Gee, I'd like to handle that Hamilton. I know his kind. Artists. Oh! [man] They got crazy ideas. They think they can do anything they want. -Ah, I'd like to string him up. -You said it. You got something there, boy. [chuckles] [indistinct chatter] -Hi, Mom. -Hi, Emily. Mom? -What's the matter, dear? -Oh, nothing. Just Angel. She's such a dirty brat. She wouldn't eat breakfast. I made eggs and everything. And I burned myself, and then she locked herself in the bathroom and I can't make her come out. She'll come out. You go on home and I'll see you tonight. There's some men outside talking. Didn't you hear me say I'm busy? Okay, Mom. -See you later. -Bye, dear. Hi, Emily. Hello, John. I just brought your mail. Mother doesn't know, I sneaked it out of the post office. Thank you, Emily. And I came to tell you, you better not go down to the village. There were some men downtown talking. And they said the next time you came they were going to get you. I hate them. Oh, I hate them! And Angel, she's as bad as my mother and all the others. She says you killed Mrs. Hamilton. Why are people so awful? They're not awful, Emily, just kind of mixed up. Can I buy you a coke or something? No. I can't. Not now. When I get a feeling like this, I just want to be alone somewhere. Marshaltown Hardware. Cement? Three one hundred pound sacks, ready-mix. $5.85. One cement trowel, seventy-nine. Hm. August 29th, August... August 31st. August 29th is the day I left for New York. -[operator] Number, please. -Give me 385, please. Come on. Come on, come on. [man] Marshaltown Hardware. Hello, I'd like some information. I just got a bill for some things I didn't order. [man] What was the date on that bill? August 29th. -[man] And your name? -John Hamilton. Stoneville. [man] Just a minute, please. I have the bill here, Mr. Hamilton. I think you'll find it correct. Took the order myself. You took it? When? [man] Oh, you called that day, about ten in the morning. Tuesday, I think it was. I never called you. [man] John Hamilton in Stoneville. That was the name. You ordered cement to repair a dam for a swimming hole. You wanted it right away, I remember that very clearly. The truck delivered it August 29th. That was Wednesday. Anything else, Mr. Hamilton? [tense music] [dramatic music] [phone rings] [phone ringing] [phone continues ringing] -Yes? -John? John, thank God you answered. Look, you've got to get out of there. A lot of men from the town are coming for you. I'm in town now and I can see them from the window. John, you can't stay there. Not the way they are, they'll kill you. The State Police found blood and cement stains on your blue jeans. And then a hardware man in Marshaltown reported that you bought cement from him. Look, John, don't stay there. Go up to my house. If you're with me, they'll calm down. Thanks, Vickie. [suspenseful music] [shouts] [man] Come on out of there, you murderer! Wife killer! Come on, Hamilton. Murderer! Come on outta there. -Where's your wife? -[glass shatters] You'd better open up. Come on now... You can't get away! You might as well face it, Hamilton. -[glass shatters] -Where's your wife? You can't get away. Murderer! [man] We'll get you, Hamilton. Wife killer! [indistinct shouting] [police siren wailing] There he is. -[man] Come on, gentlemen! -Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Sam, he's headed for the woods. We're gonna have to divide up into two groups. You take half the men and cover the left. The rest of you men, come with me. [dramatic music] Over to the right! There he is! This way, Steve. To the left! [music swells] [man] Over by that bunch of trees. I can see him over there! There he is! There he goes. This way. He's over there! There he goes! John. Emily. Shh! Shh! Be careful. It's all right, now. They can't find you here. Nobody knows about this place, just Angel and me. We got furniture and everything. Orange crates and candles from the store. Here, you're tired. You'd better sit down. You mustn't be scared. They can't hear us in here. It's something funny about the rocks. You can yell and outside nobody can hear a thing. [man] Well, where'd he go? Shh, listen. -[man] Did you see him? -[man 2] No. [man] Ah, I guess he got clean away. Well, we lost him in here somewhere. Maybe he doubled back to the road. Let's go down and find out. They're going away. You're all scratched. Here, this'll help you. I came here to be alone after I left you. I was sad, kind of... And then, when I heard all that yelling and everything, I knew what it was. I went out and then I found you. There now. Feel better? Thank you. I hate them so much. What were they going to do to you? I... I don't know. Is she dead? She is, isn't she? Where? In the woodshed. You didn't kill her. I know you didn't. Someone made it look like you did. Who was it? I don't know. [girl hooting] That's Angel. That's our signal. That means she's coming here now. [hooting] John, she'll be mad. This is her cave. You see, it was really Angel who found it. She won't want you to stay here. When she comes, you tell her that I invited you. I know how to handle her. Do what I say, no matter how it sounds. She'll be here in a minute. What's he doing here? Emily invited me here. I did not. He came in by himself. Get him out of here. -I... I hope you don't mind. -I want him out of here. This is our cave, not his. This is my cave. I'm the only one who can say anything. Me and Louise. Huh. How would she know? How could a doll know anything? [chuckles] We say he can stay. [man] Hey, Mack... Maybe he doubled back around here somewhere. [man 2] There's nothin' here. There are men out in the woods. They're looking for you. You killed Mrs. Hamilton. That's why the men are after you. I'm gonna tell 'em John's in here. I'm gonna tell. No, no, you're not. You're not telling anything, or I'll kill you. I'll choke you to death. John's staying here for as long as he wants. We're helping him and there's nothing you can do about it Sit over there in the corner. We're gonna have a picnic. Louise says you can have half of Emily's share. -Watch it, buddy. -Yeah. He might've slipped out. He knows these woods pretty good. No, he's still in there. He never got near the road. You guys, post yourself along the road here, while we round up the other group. Keep him bottled up. Let's go back to the house, hey? Oh. May I have a favor of Emily? Thank you. Where's your bike? I'm not telling you. It's outside in the bushes. You take your bike, go to the Chimney house, leave it on the highway. Then go to Steve Ritter and tell him I borrowed it. Then he'll think I thumbed a ride into town. You understand? Can you do it? If I have to. You'd better. Of course. I'll go this very minute. Emily. -Bring the kids. -I will. [exhales] -Here. -Oh, thank you. Emily is a great, big, fat, stupid slave, isn't she? Isn't she? Oh, yes. You're right. I hate her. I keep saying you did bad things to Mrs. Hamilton, just to make her mad. I wouldn't care what anyone did to Mrs. Hamilton, would I, Louise? She's such a dirty liar. And sneaking around like that all the time. "Darling, Angel, I'll give you a bracelet like it." Liar.. Why is she a liar. -Because she is. -Why is she sneaky? Because she was hiding in the Chimney's and it isn't even her own house. That's sneaky, isn't it? -When was that? -Two weeks and two days ago. I counted the days because she promised me a present. Why'd she do that? Louise remembers. Don't you, Louise? When we were riding down the road. She loves to ride and see things. Her eyes are only buttons, but she sees everything. When people are away, you shouldn't hide in their house. Mrs. Hamilton's sneaky. I was coming up the road. She was there. And somebody was with her. [engine starts] Hello, Angel. My, that's a lovely doll. Are you taking her for a ride? Yes. The people who own the Chimney's asked me to look in once in a while, that's what I'm doing. She must be a very smart doll. That's a pretty bracelet. L-I... N-D-A. "Linda." It's beautiful. -Are we friends? -I don't know. Oh, well of course we are, Angel. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a bracelet just like this, with your name on it, if you promise not to tell John or anyone else that you saw me here. Thank you, Mrs. Hamilton. Then she drove away. Every day I waited for it, but she never gave it to me. Gave you what? A gold bracelet like hers. But I don't want her stinky bracelet anyway. Who was the person in the other car? I don't know. I couldn't see. But it was a man. -Steve Ritter? -I don't know. [indistinct chatter] [shovels scraping] Well, that's it. Let's give them a stretcher. Looks like they've found the body. Yeah. Well, pick it up, boys. Put her in the car, fellas. All right, boys. Let's get going. Mr. Ritter. Now, you better get out of here, Emily. This is no place for you. I saw John Hamilton. Where? In the woods, near the Chimney's. -When? -About a half hour ago. I was riding my bike and he came running out of the woods and asked if he could borrow it. I was scared, so I loaned it to him. He rode off towards the highway. Do you hear that, men? He couldn't have got far away. Everybody, get your cars, follow me. Come on, let's go. [indistinct shouting] Come on, let's go. [cars driving away] Goodnight, Louise. It worked, John. The bike thing worked. They all rode down to the highway. Oh, good. [Emily] I brought all the kids. Come on in, all of you. -Hiya, fellas. -Hi. -Hi, John. -Hi, John. Wow, what a place. What a beautiful secret. What a good cave. Nobody said you could come in. Nobody said. You get out of here. This is mine. Angel. Angel. Come here, honey. Please, look at me. I need them. No. Get them out. You stinky kids. You get out of here. Get out! Angel, please. Emily brought them, I'll kill her. Honey I asked her to. I need them. But I need you most of all. I don't want anybody in here. Get out. Leroy, Leroy, come here, please. Come on, sit down. Listen, kids. I need all of you. Every... every... Every one of you. Shh. Quiet. They were hunting you all over the woods. My father was with them. And he just telephoned Mommy that you got to the highway and thumbed a ride. And got away. They found Mrs. Hamilton's body in the woodshed, like you said. -They dug her up? -Uh-huh. I'll bet she looked awful. Awful scary. Stare-y eyes. Awful. They took her away in the ambulance. We don't think it was you, John. We swore an oath to help you. Even if they torture us. Thank you, Leroy. Can somebody go to my house and see who's left there? I can do that. I can crawl right up there and nobody'll see me. Okay. But you be careful. I will, I will. I want to do something, too. Please, John. I can do anything as good as they can. I know you can, Timmie. What time is your supper? Five o'clock. I'm sorry, John. I have to be back before five and lie down. Mommy says I'm nervous. -How about tomorrow? -You bet. I really need you. Both of you. You two boys run along. Keep it a secret, though. -Yeah. -Hurry. Boy, this is the greatest game we ever played. Excuse me. See you tomorrow. [John] See ya. Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. Had to wait 'til Mom went out so I could get you something to eat Made you a dozen hard boiled eggs. -Some of 'em cracked a little. -I can fix 'em. -Here, I brought you a paper. -Oh, thank you. Boy, Pop and the others are goin' out of their heads looking for you. I mean, Stoneville's a nuthouse. You ought to see 'em. Buck, we're goin' to my house. You're kiddin'. What're ya goin' up there for? -To look for something. -What? Well, whenever Mrs. Hamilton wanted to hide something from me, I think she always put it in the woodshed. What kind of things? Oh, bracelets, thing like that. I don't know. Supposin' you find something, then what? I think whoever killed her gave her that bracelet a couple of weeks ago. If I can find it, it'll help. John, who do you think it was? I don't know, son. Come on, fellas. I need both of you. I need both of you to help me. Let's go. [jazz music playing] The enemy? Hi. I scared you, didn't I? I learned how to walk soft in the Boy Scouts. Well, that's what I call dandy. Now you can just go right back home and put on your merit badge. Hey, how about letting me sneak a look at the grave? [officer] Look at the grave? Sonny, I'm going to count to five, and you'd better be out of here when I'm done. One, two, three... four... -All right. All right. -Five. [jazz music continues playing] Hi. -What are you doing here? -Nothin'. [officer] Then get out of here. [Leroy] Okay, okay. [officer] I said get out of here. Hey. -Hey, this way. -Take it easy. [jazz music continues] ["Symphony No. 4 in E minor" by Brahms] [jazz music playing] [symphony continues] [Linda] Relax, darling. He won't be back for hours. [recording stops] Come on. Come on! I thought I told you to get out of here. -Yes, sir I know. -Well, you do it then. Listen, you gotta let me see the grave. I bet some kids a quarter that I could see it. Look, Sonny, don't tell me your problems. If you don't get out of here I'll call your old man. He'll blister your tail for ya. [Buck] Oh, why'd ya have to be such a rat. What's it you if I get one look. [officer] All right, now beat it. Ah, I didn't want to see it anyhow. Now, go on now. [door closes] Can I help? What's all this other stuff? Presents given to Mrs. Hamilton by the man she was meeting in the Chimney house. It happens, Emily. I know. Whoever gave this to her, killed her. Why would they kill her? I don't know. Unless she was trying to blackmail him because I wasn't making enough money and she wanted him. What are you doing? I recorded some music about a week ago. Three minutes of it. The rest of the tape is blank. I think she recorded what he said... and she was going to hold it against him. And he killed her. Who was it? I don't know. I thought it was Steve Ritter. Buck's father? No, he doesn't have enough money... to buy all this stuff for Linda. Trap needs bait... and the bait is the tape. Somebody will come and try to destroy this. Timmie! What are you doing out of bed? -Nothin'. -You know you've got a cold. Get back up there at once. Get me Steve Ritter. -Hi, John! -Hi. I brought you some breakfast. Cold calves' liver sandwiches with ketchup. Thanks, pal. Timmie couldn't come. He got a fever or a cold or somethin' like that. I don't know. Oh, he's always getting' somethin'. Boy, the town's gone completely nuts. Pop's phone's ringin' all the time. People callin' to find out if you'd been caught. Y'know, Mr. Moreland, Timmie's, father, he called three times already. Gordon Moreland. Hey, what's this thing doin' here? I'll tell you about it later. Right now, I want you to do something for me. We're your men. I want you to go to Marshaltown, and go to the TV store and get me three tubes exactly like this. Now, here's some money. If anybody asks you anything, it's for your father. Right. Come on let's go. How much money did he give ya? Five bucks. [footsteps] -Hello. -Hello, Emily. Do you have something for me to do? -Yes, something very important. -What? You take this box up to the Chimney's. Hide it under the back steps. Look for an open window. Come back as soon as you can. -Why am I doing this? -It's a trap, Emily. Who for? I think for Gordon Moreland. Timmie's father? But I don't see why he would do this? Timmie's our friend. -Boy. -You hurry now. Okay. I'll be back as soon as I can. [suspenseful music] It's all ready. I hid it under the back steps. And the living room window's open. I tried it. Thank you, Emily. Boy, and I ran all the way. You mean you're out of breath from that? You oughta quit smokin'. [laughs] It's a quarter to four. I've got to take this tape recorder to the Chimney House. Leroy... I want you home by 4:30. Tell Vickie, I mean, Mrs. Carey, to meet me at 5 o'clock at the Chimney House. Alone. It's very important. She's my only witness. Don't worry. Emily. Emily, I've got a tough job for you to do. Good. I want you to go to Mr. Moreland's... and tell him your mother has a package to be picked up at the post office. And here... while you're talking to him, jiggle this in front of him. If he asks you where you got it, you got it at the Chimney House under the back steps with some tape and some other junk. -Can you do that? -Uh-huh. -Are you mad at me, John? -No, I'm not mad at you. Can I help like the others? -Can I trust you? -Yes. Well, you can stand guard outside of the cave. Buck'll be inside. Buck, if anybody comes, you come to the Chimney House and tell me. You bet. Well, I guess that's it. -Good luck. -Good luck. Thanks. [suspenseful music] [panting] -Dad, where's-- -I've hardly soon you for two days, Leroy. Where have you been? -Nowhere. Just out. -Look at you. How do you managed to get all overheated like that? I don't know. Dad, where's Mrs. Carey? -She's out. -Out? Where'd she go? I don't know. Now sit down over there and cool off. No, I gotta go find her. -What for? -Nothing. I'm just supposed to. Well, if it's so important, maybe you can tell me. I can't, Dad. I gotta go find her Come here, boy. Now you sit down over there until you're ready to let me in on the secret, you understand? -Okay, okay. -Leroy. Leroy. Brad, I think you're making a mistake going off to Europe in the summer. Nobody goes in the summer. It's the only time we can get away. -Well, you have it your way. -[door rings] But be sure you don't miss Firenze it's one of the few places left in the world. Oh! Emily. Nice to see you. Well, come in, you're out of breathe. No, thank you. I just have a message for Mr. Moreland. Well, don't be so nervous, dear. He's right inside. Timmie has a little cold. He'll be so glad to see you. -Timmie. -[Timmie] Yeah? Look who's here to see you. -Hello, Timmie. -Hi. I have a hundred and a half fever. -Isn't that great? -[laughs] Happy birthday, Timmie. -Gee, thanks. -Emily, how nice to see you. Didn't Leroy tell you? Tell me what, dear? You're supposed to be at the Chimney's at five o'clock. -Hey! -Well, no, I... Dinner will be ready in ten minutes. Well, I... Oh, Emily, would you like to stay. -No, thank you. -Oh, so sorry. -I'm sorry. -Oh, Gordon... Emily has a message for you. Well, what is it? Mama said to tell you there's a package in the post office that you're supposed to pick. Oh, thank you, Emily. That's very sweet of you. I'll pick it up on Monday. Hello, Mrs. Carey. Hello, Mr. Brad. Hello, Emily. Oh, I'm so sorry, uncle George. Now, what was it you were saying? Something about Steve Ritter. I was telling you that I saw him this morning. He swears he'll hunt John Hamilton down if it takes him ten years. And he meant it, Roz. I never heard a man sound so strong. I never liked him. He has an instinct of a killer. Well, my goodness. Thank you for the gift, Mrs. Carey. Well, you're welcome, darling. Now, let's see what's in it. I brought you a present, too. Oh, boy! What is it? We found it in a box under the Chimney's back steps, with a big roll of some kind of tape and a lot of other jewelry. It's all still there, except this. We each get one. Take your pick. Did you really find it? Or is it part of the game with John? [gasps] I did my part. Didn't I, Emily? I never told. Just like John said. What about John? What did you say? Do you know where John is? Answer me! Father, you're hurting me. -Gordon. -I'm waiting. [Gordon] You'll know what you'll get if you don't tell me. [sobs] He's in a cave. -Where? -A secret cave in the woods. Hello. Hello? Get me Steve Ritter. Hurry. I said hurry, are you deaf? [sobs] [knocks] Well? It all went wrong, John. [sobs] She told me everything on the way over. Darling, it was Timmie, not you. Timmie told them about the cave. They were calling the police when we left. -Honey... -[sobs] Did you tell Mr. Moreland about finding the tape under the steps? [sighs] Yes. I showed Timmie the gold bracelet and said that we found it with the tape. And everybody was listening. Honey, that was all you were supposed to do. Thanks. Don't cry, baby. You did beautifully. -[sniffs] -See? You really think it was Gordon? [breathes deeply] If it is, he'll try and destroy the tape. If it isn't, I'm on the run again. Gordon and Linda. It just doesn't seem logical. She's always been impressed by him. He's the celebrity I never was. She was out to get him. [car driving by] I think there's a car coming. Don't let them see you. [suspenseful music] [car door opens] Somebody's getting out. He's running through the bushes. Brad. Brad. [footsteps] [car door closes] I'm sorry. It doesn't make sense. Could I help-- It can't be Brad, he was in New York with you. The tape... the tape will prove it. [hoots] -The enemy? -Yeah. -Buck, look out! -[Steve] Buck! Buck you-- Buck, you come here! -Now where is here? -[panting] Where is he? [man] Where's Mr. Hamilton? Tell us, where is he? Go ahead, tell him. Go ahead. Now, I'm going to ask you one more time. Son, look at me. This is your father speaking to you. -Where is he? -Where's Mr. Hamilton? You know where he is. Tell us. Where is he? Tell him, dear. The Chimney house. Hey, Chief, the Chimney house! [sobs] Let's get back to the cars. -[indistinct shouting] -Come on! [car doors closing] [cars revving] [brakes screeching] John, they're here. You'd better open up. Come on outta there, you murderer! [knocks] Go on. Ah, some of you men come with me. ["Symphony No. 4 in E minor" by Brahms] [door rattles] Stand back. All right, John. Come outta there. I'm waiting. Okay, John, I'm coming in after you. -[glass shatters] -Go away! [Vickie] Emily! You had us fooled, didn't you? You and the kids. Is that the tape Mr. Moreland was talking about? Yes, it is. I don't get it. Music. What's that supposed to prove? Steve, let it play, then we'll know. Ah, shut it off. All right, John-boy, let's go. No, we've got to hear this. Vickie. I said, let's go. [Linda] Relax, darling. He won't be back for hours. He's out in the woods with all the neighborhood brats. My husband is every foundling's loving father. Oh, Brad darling, the ring is just beautiful, but you're mad to spend all that money. [Brad] I love you, Linda. When I think of what you have to put up with. If the ring'll make you happy... [Linda] Oh, Brad darling, I need you so. You don't even know. But you've got Vickie. [Brad] Don't talk about Vickie. I've told you all that before. [Linda] Tell me again. Do you love her, Brad? [Brad] How can you say that, Linda? You know I don't. I never did. I told you, I married her because my father asked me to. She had money, and his business was in a lot of trouble. He thought he'd had to go to prison. -Well, I didn't mind her. -Shut it off! -[Brad] I mean she... -[tape clicks] [John] Brad came here to destroy this tape. She was going to blackmail you, wasn't she, Brad? We planted another tape. I think you'll find it in his pocket. If you're trying to say my son killed Mrs. Hamilton, you're making a fantastic accusation. He was in New York the day she was killed. I sent him there myself on business. And John Hamilton was with him. Isn't that true, Mr. Hamilton? Yes, he was in New York with me. By the way, Steve, on the way to New York, I passed you on the road, you were going to my house. Wait a minute. All this wild talk. I'm callin' Captain Greene. And then... Go ahead, Mr. Hamilton. Let's hear it from you, Brad. Linda called you the morning we went to New York. -The morning she was killed. -No. She was going to send that tape to Vickie, wasn't she? I don't know what you're talking about. She did that because she realized I was going to turn down the job in New York. It meant a lot of money. She came to you before... but... this time she really meant it, didn't she? I don't believe it. It meant the end of your marriage. The wrecking of your business. You were frightened Brad, weren't you? But there was somebody to help you, wasn't there? No, there wasn't any... You and I went to New York. That someone came and got three bags of cement and charged it to my name. He came into my house, killed my wife and buried her. Then they typed a note, wrecked my house and slashed my paintings Then took my blue jeans and burned them so somebody could find them. -Who was it? Who is it! -Leave him alone. It's not his fault. Maybe it's mine. As a boy, he could never quite make his own way. I don't understand it. I really don't understand it. I tried. God knows I tried to do everything I thought a father was supposed to do. It's my fault. But I tried. While he was in New York, I went to her house, and I dragged that woman into the shed, and... And you killed her. All right, take them in and book 'em. Let's go, Mr. Carey. You, too. Brad... [phone dialing] [Greene] Get me the D.A.s office. [kids shouting] John. John. Look.
