GODS Are you gonna stay? - Dunno, are you? - I don't know. Who are you supposed to be with? One guy comes, and then another... So what? Stop being a dick. If you're staying, I'm staying. - Do whatever you want. - Come on, let's go. You're staying with that jerk? He's more wasted than you are! What are you looking at? - You're from Lima? - Yes, from Lima. I was born in Arequipa, but I've always lived here. No way! Toti is also from Arequipa! Of course, the Ricketts family! - What's your last name? - Moreno. My family is from the North, but that must not mean much. The North is pretty. I knew a Ricketts, a guy my age. Maybe Roberto's brother! By the way, Roberto had another child. He's so cute! He's already six months old. He's precious! They're so cute at that age. How are the other kids? Great. The older one just graduated, and the younger one is starting 9th grade. I can't believe it! They're really model kids, those two. - They go to Markham? - Of course. That school makes all the difference. Kids come out serious and responsible. It's really the best. Those gringos should invade us. They're not gringos, they're British! Same difference! As long as they invade us! So tell us... What are your plans? What matters is that you seem so happy. Of course. You're doing everything as you should. It's ideal. You're doing everything in order. You don't have to worry about a thing. We all live in peace here. That's exactly what I told Agustin. And you'll always have something to do! We never stop! Let's toast! Lovely to meet you! Hoping you enjoy yourself here. That you'll have a nice time. Fantastic. Wonderful. Thank you. - Where'd you find that? - Pretty, huh? Yeah, but bringing her here... - She is young. - Too young? Not too young. - Ripe. - And seasoned? Stop staring at her. You gonna marry her or is it just for some ass? I can't get her out of my head. Or did your head get stuck inside of her? Getting her an apartment would've sufficed. Am I making a mistake? No, Agustin, you're not making a mistake. You're making a fucking big mistake! What do the kids think? They never think anything. - Are they coming? - They said they'd come... You should talk to them. I get along with my kids. Here comes the loser now. Look who's here! Here you are, son. Good to see you. Where were you? - Where you coming from? - I was out. - What do you mean? - At a party. - And your sister? - She stayed. - You were supposed to come say hello. - Can I go now? - Did you say hi to Elisa? - Yes, Dad. When will you learn how to wear a shirt, pants? And don't stay in the kitchen! - I can't stand him! - Diego. - Hi. - What's wrong? - Is Andrea with you? - No, Nelly. I'm serving dinner. Go eat with the others. - I can't stand them. - I'll fix you something. Ines... Thanks. - Did you say hello to your father? - Yes. Do you want something else? Diego! Where is your sister? Hey, are you listening to me? Go get her, please. You know where she is. Now! He's such a pain in the ass... Caregol! Have you seen Andrea? No, I haven't. - What time is it? - I don't know. Andrea, come on. Let's go. Come on. Good morning. - What did we discuss yesterday? - Dad, don't start. We said we'd spend the evening together. I was tired. I slept at a friend's house. Do you remember Elisa? The new maid? Hello, how are you? It's a pleasure to meet you. Hello. You've been going out every night. I know. Take a break, today is Sunday. Like God! Of course, otherwise I'll get wrinkles. Diego, tomorrow, Ramon will bring you to my office, first thing. - Why me? - Tomorrow in my office at 8 AM sharp! - OK? - Yes, Dad. 8 in the morning, bad trip! Goddammit! "Yes, Dad." What do you want me to say? "Yes, Dad." Eat it, eat it! Last one in the pool has to drink it! Naked! Jerk. Andrea, you have to drink it! Should I bring it to you? Hey! Were you sleeping? Get up! Let's go to the beach. Dude, I know it's Sunday. Who are you with? OK, go back to sleep. Bye. Shit! Who should I call? You don't have to go out. We could watch a movie. Truja! How ya doin'? Come pick me up. Take your dad's car. No, let's go out. I'm hung-over too, but it's hell here. OK, bye. What a fucking bunch of wankers! What am I going to do? Sucky Sunday... Caregol, it's me. Can you come get me out of here? Yeah, I'm ready. Hurry up! What the hell are you doing? - What are you looking at? - Nothing. - They run every morning? - Yes, miss. - And the rest of the day? - They go back to Lima. - They all go back on Mondays? - Yes. - They come back in Thursdays? - On Fridays. Did you enjoy Saturday? - Sorry? - Saturday, did you like it? Yes, it was fun. You were beautiful. Your hair... A living doll. - Mrs. Toti has two children, right? - Yes. - And do you have children? - No. That's the Brescias' house. The one next to it is the Benavides'. And further down is Mrs. Claudia's. The last house is Mr. Gustavo's and Mrs. Toti's. - What time do you finish? - At 6 p. m. And then what do you do? Sometimes I go out, sometimes I stay in. - Mr. Agustin lets you go out? - Yes, miss. Others forbid it, but Mr. Agustin is very nice. That's good. Now I'll be the one who decides. Thank you, miss. Excuse me, I'm going to get back to work. Mom? How are you? Yes, it went well. Really well. I can't come today. I have to go to Lima to take care of Agustin. Next weekend, I promise. Chato was looking for me? What for? I have nothing to say to him. Don't give him my new number. So, what's up with you? Do you have your schedule and books? Is everything ready? When does registration end? Today. You're talented, son. You're goddamn talented. You were first in math, remember? Management. That's your thing. The doors are open for you here. When are you going to visit the factory? Don't worry. Today, take care of the university stuff, and tomorrow, come to our meeting. They'll be happy to see you. Buy yourself a tie, be elegant. Some of those people will be working for you one day. Don't forget that. Don't forget who you are. Yes, Dad. Have you decided on which car you'd like? Summer is almost over and you haven't said anything. You thought I'd forgotten? I'd really like a 4x4. A Suzuki. That's for kids. Be serious. A Ford F-150. It's the car for you: classy, original, elegant... But... Dad, I don't know... I see. You'll have your Suzuki, if you prefer a toy. But at least... stop moping around, you look like a damn idiot... always slouching. Too much profile, turn towards me. Too much tummy? A bit. I ate too much, sorry. Shall we take a break while you digest, or should I touch them up after? Your call. Touch them up later. - Like this? - Yes, that's good. Here we go. Today's message has a unique meaning for each of us. In Matthew, guilt is more present, than in Luke. But what matters is to be aware of the work to do. Here, ma'am. Anything else? - The "soy sauce, please". - Yes. But guilt obliges everyone to take responsibility. Absolutely. Guilt shouldn't exist. There's no such thing as chance, everything happens for a reason. Every cause produces an effect. We're all potential gods. That is "BBQ sauce", not "soy sauce." You don't know what "soy sauce" is? It was right next to this one. - Go look again. - Yes, ma'am. We'd like this circle of energy to guarantee us all a wonderful end of summer. The last activities are coming up. We hope to raise as much as possible to help those in need. Let's also think of our loved ones. We hope that our children will have a good year in high school or in university. That's all. What's the problem? You can't find it? It's right next to the other sauces. It says: "Soy sauce." You can't find it? Did you read the label? Lidia! Forget it, just go. Elisa, darling. What do you think? Yes, of course. Toti is the most religious one, right? She knows the Bible by heart. It's crazy. I never would've guessed. Let's see, Ezekiel... Daniel... Matthew... Luke... that's the one we read, I think. "And then, a woman sinner who..." This is so tedious... First of all, you need to make up your mind. You have to be sure. A woman in doubt should never get an abortion. You will always have an incurable wound inside your head. What if I don't want it? I'll tell you what it'll cost and you'll get it. That's it. Can I pay with a credit card? How far along are you? Six, seven weeks? More? Girls do that when they don't have money or if they've been raped. But you? What if it's more than 8 weeks? Then there's nothing I can do for you. After eight weeks, things have become more concrete. You can see them. The operation is longer, there's more anesthesia, and more bleeding. And all of that will remain in your head. Some good boning! What an idiot! We need some XTC. I'm stopping. Let's mess around with them aid! - She has great ass. - Are you nuts? - It's nice to grab. - You're a loser. Be nice and get us some ice. - What? - Some ice. Screw you! Get it yourself. Come on, sweetie, go get us some ice. Thanks. Don't move. I'll go. - Ines. - Hello. - Go get some ice. - Right away. So when are we going out? I'm serious. I'll come get you. I'll call you, and we'll go somewhere. OK? Why are you laughing? Stop it! What? Do I scare you? - Where's the ice? - Here it is. You coming? - Did he bother you? - What? Did he bother you? No, he just came to get some ice. Don't play the innocent. If they bother you, say something. Or do you like it? - No. - Well, then? Why don't you say anything? Speak. Say something. - OK, Diego. - No, Ines. If you don't speak up, everyone will think it's all fine. Yes, Diego. "Yes, Diego." Fuck... What are we going to do today? We could go to someone's house. - Whose house? - Anybody's. Or we could all go out to a good restaurant. - To see all of them again? - Yes. But you're seeing them tomorrow. What? Alright. - What should I wear? - Anything. Tell me what to wear. What for? Come on... Put on any dress. I don't have "any dress", idiot. What's wrong, love? Tell me what I should wear. What would you like to wear? Clothes. - What, don't you have any? - No. What do you need? Everything. I need everything. Well, then... let's go buy you everything! What's wrong? - Your friends? - I don't care. Andrea stayed at home? Yes. Why are you sad? Come play with us! - You already have teams. - It doesn't matter. It's my serve! It's for me! He's the winner. I love it. It's Cronos devouring his children. Do you know them? Chronos wanted to kill his children because the prophet said one of them would dethrone him. He ate them one by one. But his wife saved Zeus. Yes, I remember. It's one of the Nani's creations. It's fabulous. The money raised will go to the psychiatric hospital. We also give them advice on their garden and their vegetables. Come on. A house without plants isn't a home. I hate artificial plants. Julio Rubini have met his one. He brought it back from Madagascar. What happened to last year's fern? You're right! I messed that one up. I wasn't supposed to water it, but I did. It died. It had radicular rotting. - What about the cacti? - Gorgeous. Peruvianus monstruosus. It's a San Pedro, a disease deformed it. It's wild what a disease can do! And this is the yellow-spined echinocactus grusonii. They come from Mexico. It's also called "Mother-in-law's cushion". Let's go to the club this weekend! With the kids. - With Kike. - Which Kike? Yours, hers, all of them! He's nothing like other 80-year-olds! Christina's father-in-law is terrible! He walks around with a book "Sex after 60"! Can you believe it? Did you cut your hair? I want to cut mine too, I just don't know when. When do you decide... to cut your hair short? You don't decide, the mirror does. How awful! The calendars have arrived! They're fabulous. Let's applaud! If you come every afternoon, we'll get you a pass right away. If you come by now and then, call me first. But that would be useless. We'd be wasting our time. And we don't want to waste our time, do we? Yes, but... Ernesto's son has started. He's a hard-worker. He has his own sales office. Hard-workers are rewarded here. It's up to you. You can run your own office. - Did you talk to your sister? - I haven't seen her. You have to talk to her. Otherwise, who will? It's think... A woman who thinks is a man! Good one, huh? Laugh for God's sake! Always the same expression! I'm happy you're here, champ. Do you want a soda. Yes, Mom, everything possible. I went to the office. He took me around. Yes, Andrea is fine. I'll tell her. - We? - She wants to know how you are. Why won't you talk to her. To tell her "everything" like you do? Whatever. Dad wants me to talk to you. He says you're a loafer. I work and make money. He can fuck himself. He wants you to do something else. Find a husband? So he'll leave me alone! Do what he says. Like you? That asshole annoys everyone, but does whatever he wants! It's bullshit. Is that how they want us to end up to. Married with kids. You think they're happy? Dunno. Andrea, what the hell are we doing here? - What? - Let's get out of here. - To Lima? - No. Not Lima, no way. - Where then? - I don't know. Tell Ramon to take you to your friends, they must be up to something. - I'm going out. - Where are you going? Just out. Cobaea scandens. Madam, this came for you. Thank you. Primula japonica. Saxifraga wilsoniana. Cobaea scandens. Acer rufinerve. How do they remember so much crap? The have nothing better to do. Unbelievable... Melocactus bellavistensis. Yellow-spined Echinoctus grusonii. Euphorbia lactea candelabra. Trichocereus peruvianus monstruosus. Hello, I'm Pilar. Hello. I'm Elisa. Nice to meet you. Lovely to meet you. You look radiant! Absolutely divine. Divine. Did you see her? Yes, but she was so... She was so... You're kidding? I don't believe you! That's absolutely crazy! So crazy! Crazy! Impressive. Impressive! Excuse me... Excuse me. Vitis viniferae... You get married and you have it! It's not complicated. What if you don't wanna get married? You have it alone. But your dad would find out one day. Why? He'd just kill you! When does it really start showing up? Six months, for sure. You can just wear one of those bands. Like in the Middle Ages! Or you get rid of it? Well, yeah! What would you do with a kid? Your life would be screwed! You'd only think of your kid. No one would ask you out. Obviously, your tits would drop to the ground. It's horrible. - What? - Having an abortion. Yeah. Someone told me that they stick tweezers inside and yank it out... Gross! Like a scoop of ice cream! - Nasty. - Sounds like it. Not to get pregnant! Well, it depends on who knocks you up! What if you don't know. Come on! Of course you'd know. What? No shit! Are you knocked up? Tell us! No shit! You didn't use anything? Whose is it? Whose is it? Did you tell your dad? Jesus, she doesn't even know whose it is! It was between Christmas and mid-January. New Year's. - No, nothing happened. - You fucked Cano. Yeah, but with a rubber. There was another party before. Which one? - At Chata's. - Yeah, right. - I went to bed early that night. - Early? You were so trashed, you don't remember! But we didn't fuck, I slept. - Then at Chino's party. - Which one? We ended up at someone's house. I remember! That night you were all over Caregol! - Gross. - Caregol? How could you? I didn't do him. It grosses me out. Are you gonna tell him? I didn't fuck him, you're insane. Or did I? What a slut! - What are you gonna tell him? - Shit... Nothing! To a dimwit like that? Poor guy, he's nice... Yeah but he's a scumbag. To yours and Caregol's baby! So, I just forget about it? Of course you do! - Got any XTC? - As much as you want. - Bye bye, baby! - You'll kill it. From an overdose. Diego... I think she overdid it. Thanks. I'll leave. What are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, calm down... Go to sleep. You're going to love it. - What are you doing to her? - Hello, my darling. - I brought some tamales. - Mom, how did you get in? Look! It's so pretty! How did you find my house? I asked. What do you think? Mom, get out! You're going to screw it all up! I told you not to meddle in my life! Look how Grandma is dressed! I could've bought her something. So, then... Finish the dishes, are some food and then finish up with the laundry. These ladies have come to help you out. OK. Are you coming? I'll be right there. Mom. We can't make it today. Agustin has meetings and can't take a lunch break. Maybe next week. Agustin apologizes. I'll call you later or tomorrow. My mother just canceled lunch. My grandmother is sick. Have you thought it over. That's what I thought. What should I do? - Do you want to become a mother? - No. What then? An abortion, at three months? You can't keep this baby. No shit. What would you do with a kid here? - What? - You have to leave now. - Where to? - Wherever you want. To Miami. Go back to Lima and pack. I'll take care of the rest. How am I gonna live there? The same as you do here. Exactly the same? Don't worry about a thing. Exactly the same. When's it due? In six or seven months. Why don't you have a child with me? That's what I'm saying too. But it's not mine. She's only 21. What would she do with a baby? What do I have to do? Nothing. Just sign some papers. Nothing... It'll be mine. But I want to get married. Six months in Paris. I won't take care of anything. What's up? What are we gonna do? - You want to leave? - No, not that. What are we going to do? Stay at Dad's? It won't look good to the family. We're brother and sister. What the fuck are you talking about? Are you nuts? What's wrong with you? Kike! Come on, put something on that boogies! Can I have another drink, please? Those two are getting too close to each other! It's too early. Who's gonna start? Get out there, Gustavo! No way. I have my dignity. Come, Elisa! It's very easy! Just put your hands together and look at your ass. Don't say anything to Diego. He'd die. I just wanted to talk to you. But don't tell him anything. I'll call him tomorrow when I get there. Have you seen Andrea? She must be with her friends. Do you want something to eat? - Claudia. - What? I've read the entire Bible... All the books on the flowers... I read everything. Everything? You're crazy! Saint Matthew... Saint Luke, Saint Mark... Have some, Gustavo. The Bible is nice, but terribly dull. A bit long, yes. Just a bit. ' Chronos... Chronos... What an asshole! Don't criticize my Chronos. And Lot? Listen. Listen to me. Lot... is also an asshole! That's for sure! - Drink up! - No, I've got a headache. I'll drink alone. You've had enough! Stop her! My head is killing me! That's my salsa. Diego's still not home? He must be looking for his sister. Why is he always doing that? He takes care of her. Wouldn't you do the same? Yeah, right. What a bunch of lazy bums. ' They drink, they dance, and then they go to bed. What time is it? The sun is rising, it must be about 4. What time do we have to wake up? What's the use of going to bed? Can't we sleep some more? Andrea has gained weight, hasn't she? That's none of our business. On our studies. How are your English classes going? "I speak English." Can you read and write? And speak? You did. When do the classes start? In April. Where are you? Where? What the hell are you doing in Miami? What problem? - Did you know about Andrea? - Yes. - What's she doing in Miami? - In Miami? Holy shit! I don't know. Your father probably sent her. - Or she's been embarrassed. - Of what? Staying here with her big belly. Nelly, did you know about Andrea? Outside, at the gas station. I don't want to go back. I don't know. I'll find a place. Where is it? How do I get there? OK. You live here? In the winter, when I'm not with you at the beach. - Want some coffee? - No, Nelly, thanks. - Your father's going to miss you. - No. I don't think so. Don't say that. He's a kind man. Kind? You really think he cares about me or you? Of course. He's even good to us out here. He's helped us a lot. The kids have a place to play ball now. Look, close this... and you'll sleep well. You're leaving? I have to. Gianluca... What do you think? Already imagine him in high school... at graduation... Metallurgical engineer. I can see him at the foundry, working the metals, preparing the alloys. So, how are my nephews? Missing you as all the others. The women work while you just loaf around. - That's how it should be. - I'm still single. Chato, it's been a while. This idiot is still waiting for you. Forget it. Chato, there's no way. Cheers! So, what's up? Are you getting married? Yep. I suppose we'll be invited? I would think so. As what? As waiters? Idiot! Don't get mad. I'll bring you some cake. I suppose you should do so. My sweet hat. Let go. But I'm getting married outside. You mean, on the corner? At the market? In Paris. Jesus! In Paris? Cheers! I knew something was going on. You never came to see me. I was waiting for the right moment. How far along are you? Three months? Almost. You'll invite us to the baptism? To meet your husband. You don't come with him. Shouldn't she have? - It's the least... - Agustin is so busy. But he asked me to buy you this. And he sends his regards. That's nice. Did you see your grandmother? Is she in her room? Go tell her all your news. She'll be thrilled. My grandmother... Hello. Son... There's someone I want you to meet. This is Carla, Chalo's daughter. She lives in Argentina but she's spending 6 months here. - First time in Lima? - Yes. - Do you like it? - A lot. - How long are you staying? - Six months. - Didn't you work at the beach? - Yes. You work here now? No, I've just come to help. - I'm studying. - That's great. He is gorgeous, Elisa! Gianluca, right? He has his father's eyes. He's beautiful! We want to congratulate the father! Call him. Look, the daddy is in heaven. Congratulations! Your son is marvelous. Whenever you want for a little brother! To your health! I have to tell you all about Paris. The fashion! The fabulous food... We want to know everything, Elisa. Andrea didn't come? What are you thinking, Kike? Come to your own son's baptism, pretend it's not your kid and smile? - Gone in Miami? - Alone? That girl is never alone. Poor Agustin, at least the baby looks like him. But not at all like Elisa. Maybe when he'll grow up. Did you see Elisa? She sure looks great. The trip did her good. She was lucky to have met Agustin. Yes, poor girl. Yes, Mom, he lived all by himself in the slums. You had the choice and you went to El Agustino? What a crazy idea! - And now? - I'm in university. - Wonderful. - In humanities. I'm hesitating between sociology and psychology. Your stay in El Agustino has made you sensitive. Those are attractive domains... OCRed & proofread by moni@KG 1/12/2016 Minor corrections by bruno321@KG 05/02/2022
