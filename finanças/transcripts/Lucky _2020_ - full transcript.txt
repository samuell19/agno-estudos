Here I am. You hurt my feelings. Do you understand? I do understand.

I'm not being punished because all these other women aren't being punished, right? So I understand now. I'm not a bad person. Ted, can you tell me who he is? You know. I do? You know that it doesn't really matter. Doesn't matter who the man is or how to fight him or how to fix it. This is just how things are. Right. Let's go inside. You know we're not safer there.
