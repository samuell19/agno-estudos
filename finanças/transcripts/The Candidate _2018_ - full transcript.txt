Carlos, is that mine? These are, don Manuel. Did the gentlemen order red shrimp? It's about time, the red shrimp. The invention of the year. Super intuitive... I can't, I have things to do, I have an operation. - What? - What did Cabrera call it? Amadeus. What operation? It's no big deal. Go ahead, you can say it. He has adenoids. Yeah, right, adenoids. That too. I have adenoids too. So this time you're having an operation Now "The Lady" has adenoids! "The Lady!" "The Lady!" But you can't miss the Amadeus thing, no bullshit. When Cabrera gets back from Switzerland. - China. - I thought it was Switzerland. You thought wrong. Paco was there, how was the snow? Fine. I need to talk to you. No, let's hear about Rafa's vacation. Go on. Remember to write down the Jean Baptiste thing. Hold on, I can't right now. No, no, now is not the time... - Don't bullshit me. - Just drop it. The ledger, the ledger! Pass me the ledger. Please, it looks like a missal. - José Luis. - "The Lady" is losing his memory. - We'll make a mess. - Give me the ledger. "The Lady!" "The Lady!" I'm going to audit "The Lady!" "The Lady" will tell you all to go to hell. You're going to laugh your heads off, you'll see. - Write it down. - I am. Let's see. Yeah, yours is here. - Short or long version? - Short, please. Short. Vacation: Cies Islands, Luci's alcohol poisoning, call to the tourism councilman. Fuck the vacation. And Luci's helicopter ride to the ER in Vigo. Thank you, Susana. That girl will be the end of me. She's exactly like you. That's what my wife says. Check out the boss. new blood. That's why for me it's an honor, but nothing new, to introduce Rodrigo Alvarado, our Chief of Staff. A man who will help us take this country even further. Presenting the new recruit. Jealous, Paco? No way. She can't even look at him. Obviously not an easy job, but very clear to me, to solve problems and help the country... - Do the imitation. - Him or her? Leave her alone, she has enough. - Imitate D'Artagnan. - Okay, okay. Go on, Manul! - Let's see. - I'm like a foot short. Don't laugh, don't be mean. Here I go. I'm Alvarado. I'm young, I'm on the ball. I have a face like Dolph Lundgren. And above all else, zero tolerance for corruption. I was born to fight corruption. You're a bunch of gangsters. What a clown. A clown with many friends. - José Luis. - What? That's your fourth. And many of those friends in the National Court, so... don't laugh too much. José Luis for president! President, president! President, president! So your vacation went okay? Fine, fine. How about you? At the health resort, resting. Fine. I'm giving the go ahead. Not tomorrow or the next day, but soon. But... Did something happen? I want this under control as soon as possible. But we said in four years, right? Things might happen faster. - What does Madrid say? - I don't give a shit. - What, you don't want it? - Of course I do. It's an honor. No, it's not an honor. It's my office. It has to be you. Because you don't bow down to Madrid or anyone. Until I say, only Inés can know. All right? You're making me the happiest man in Spain. You know that, right? Thank you. THE - You never change your mind? - All the time. But not at work. I can't add much more than what I said on the phone. Do you know how many people I have to see today? - 1 have tons of work. - Yeah, me too, much more. Frias wanted to come here when he heard about this. I told him: "Wait." How long have we known each other? Along time. When we were the opposition we helped you when you needed it, didn't we? Yes, you know you're very dear to me. Then why the hell are you doing this to us? Because it feels like it's time, doesn't it to you? You don't get it. Either do it or we will. The only option I can think of, if you're morally exhausted, step aside, we'll find a replacement... - So you're giving me no choice. - You already made your choice. You're not choosing now, you chose a long time ago. Or do I have to remind everyone what's here? Be responsible. - Did a lot of people come? - Yeah, it's almost full. This way, don Manuel. - Hello. - Hello. Rosa, how are you? Hi, Manuel. How are you? - It's good to see you. - You too. What's up? Hi, how are you? May 1? I was going over it. How is everything? A lot of work lately. Good. I thought you had finished. No, they delayed me. - But you came from Madrid? - Yes. I'll probably miss the last train. - You were going before me. SR CRRY/CTS But since you said you were coming, they pushed me back. And I hate to wait. How is Enric??' Fine. - It's too bad what happened to him. - Too bad, yeah. You have to be careful what you say. You shouldn't, if it's true. At least in my field. I'm sure he'll come back strong. Sure, yeah. - Say hi for me, okay? - Okay. You're the one doing well. Congratulations. - You're working great. - Thanks. Even if you have to run from city to city... - You're the best in the morning by far. - Thank you. You don't like me, do you? Or you see me as an enemy. Mr. Lopez Vidal... Come with me, please. No, let her go first. I'm going to check my notes. No, that's okay. You said you were in a hurry so we changed... Yeah, but what I had after got canceled. Let her go. - It's really not necessary. - Are you sure? I insist, let her. Okay. Amaia, let's go, please. - Please. - Okay, then. Thank you. This way I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, definitely. Okay. Manu, hey. Your phone's been ringing. Come on. FRANCISCO CASTILLO TAKEN INTO CUSTODY The search began early this morning 4 and showed activity in August. Authorities believe the vice-secretary could be involved in a case of manipulating public bidding. Regional Vice-secretary Francisco Castillo... I'm leaving. has been taken into custody at a delicate time for the party, since Madrid is promoting an image of renovation and transparency with recruits like Rodrigo Alvarado, - ex-judge of the National Court. - That's right, Amaia. And Rodrigo Alvarado himself... - I'll call you later, okay? - Okay. from Madrid. At headquarters he defended the party's innocence... How bad is it? I don't know. - Should I be worried? - No. These cases will no longer be tolerated. We're working hard To cut this off at the source. Right away. - What's up, Manuel? - What's up? Everything under control? - Can't you see? - You sure? Yes, yes. Yes, you pain. Leave me alone. - Make sure there's nothing left. - Goodbye. Good morning, Tere. Big mess, huh? It won't stop ringing. Look, he wants you to go in. Thank you. If we go together, they can't say no. - They'll have no choice. - Should I come back later? And don't complain, it's not your style. Yeah, fine, but that's all I can say. - Worse for me. - Why the fuck not? You know exactly why not. Then let's do something, damn it. Your kid has it tough, face it. We'll think of something to do with him, but not the other thing. - Can you hear me? - Yes, goodbye. Damn, that woman talks a lot. How are you? Well, you've see it. What do you think? - This Paco can't get anything right. - What do we do? I was thinking of visiting the four of them. - From the last mess. - Why? No, don't do anything. This way we make sure we cover Paco. Do what I say for once. Stay calm. All right? Look, there is one thing. I want you to ease off with that jerk Cabrera. - It's going too strong, we need to ease off. - I'll look into it. - But you know what he's like. - No, I don't. He complains, he says we're looking over their shoulders. - Who? - Him, the businessmen. - So what? - He'll get angry and won't come back. I don't care, damn it, the party matters more than one "Money Grabber." Yes. - I'll call him when he gets back from China. - Okay. Everything clear? Yes, yes. Okay, then. Go out there and smile. No, better in my office, I'm meeting someone for lunch. Okay, great. Come on, gentlemen, this isn't so hard. We still need to put the chairs. - Damn, Manuel, give me a hug. - Gallardo. Do we know anything? - Can we talk? - Yes, of course. Let's have a seat. Sergio! Bring some coffee. What's up? - You want some orange juice? - No, no. Sergio! Bring some fresh orange juice! You love this, huh? You being okay, Manu, that's what I love most. Then keep quiet about the Paco thing until it's over. - You got that? - My lips are sealed. Sealed my ass. - 1 mean with important stuff... - Come on, I know you. You can't keep quiet even underwater. The juice? The juice! Right away. You get what you pay for. I would do anything for Paco. - Then keep quiet, you got that? - Yes. - Did you understand me? - Yes. Very good. - I'm off. - You're leaving? What about your juice? See you at the Amadeus meeting on Saturday? Yes. - See how his trip to China went. - We'll see. I think it will blow over in two months, okay? Okay. Just relax, Pareja. Nothing will happen. Look at you. You're too damn nervous. You can't go around like this. If nobody talks, nothing will happen to Paco. Stop looking so stressed. What's wrong? - Is it your wife...? - No, no... Fine, I'm just... It's okay, that's it. Don't worry about it. And the other thing? - What other thing? - You know. Forget about that. You mean Persika? Forget it. - It's under control. - You sound too sure. - You know anything? - No. - But we'll get caught. - No, we won't. With that face, they fucking will. I talked to Juan Ignacio and he said not to worry. Everybody can relax. I ate with him last week. And I told him: "Cut anything you have to, clean up anyone you have to." Nothing but peace and quiet. Okay? You got that? To Paco. Let's hope it's nothing. Sure. You're sure, aren't you? - Completely, Susi. - Whatever you say. If you say everything is fine, - I'll relax. - Don't worry, Susi. Good, because I can't take any more bad news. What's wrong? E found drugs on my youngest. - Guile? The maid checked his pockets before washing his clothes. Damn, Susi. You two are so lucky with Nati. Well, she's no saint... At least her head is in the right place. Well, some days. I'm really in bad shape. I'm here for you, okay? I know, Manu. Thank you, sweetie. - Welcome back. - 1 couldn't wait to get back. Why doesn't anyone warn me about this shit? - Did it go that badly? - They're gross. They spit during meetings and burp in your face at lunch. For them that's good manners. Manners? Their burps make you want to throw up the crap you just ate. And they eat crap there, Manuel. What a stench! Chinese people swarming everywhere. The assholes sure love money though. And the bastards watch you. They'd sure watch you! Are you stupid? You don't believe me? - 1 don't make stuff up, Manu. - Okay, come on. Right there. I don't make stuff up. Good evening. Martin Millers, tonic on the side. Have you got Yamazaki? One ice cube. ST e - It was awesome. Really awesome. For you too. - Wow, Cabrera! I - It's Christmas. - Where did you get this? - High quality. It sure is. I shouldn't even explain it to you. Homo. - See you on Saturday, right? - Yeah, yeah. "The Lady" said he might not come, that he has adenoids. He'll come, you'll see. You guys will flip over the new toy, it's amazing. What did you want to tell me? Paco. That's a big mess. Not a word. Let's see here... Iphoney... Iphone. - Right? - Yeah. This phone rocks, it has an amazing camera. Very nice, very nice! Captain? How are we doing? We've got the wind at our backs. Full sails ahead! - Let's go! - You're the best, you bastard! Gallar, how's it going? And over there we have my princess of the South Seas. Lucia! My daughter! Say something! - Piss off, Dad! - She's got a huge hangover. How are you guys? Mamma mia, mamma mia. Mamma mia, what ladies. A couple of mermaids. - How are you two? - Living like kings. And may you stay that way. Yes, sir. Over here we have a real gentleman, a king. Paco, Paquito, Paco. What's up, Paquito? Better than in jail, huh? - How's the image on that? - It has a quality of 2 megapixels. The image is awesome. You'll see, Inés. Technology... I'll email you a link later. SN 1 (Y R R I. It's worth a fortune. How do I turn this off? Hit that button. That one. - Did he tell you anything? - No. - He doesn't want to talk about it. - He won't talk to me. The party's over. He only talks to Ceballos and Alvarado. Another slippery one. She won't take my calls, but if she needs me, - we're family... - If she doesn't, she doesn't, damn it. - Are you new at this or what? - Hey, lovebirds. Look, this subject is starting to bore the media. And with the other thing you're covered, okay? So don't worry. - I'd be lost without you. - Fuck, no. Well? What do you guys think? The house in Teixeiro. Who was behind it? The police, of course. Yeah, I know it was the police. But who tipped them off? Tell us already. - The new guy. - What new guy? The new plumber. The raid? That guy does anything you want, Manu. He gets anything you want. Very nice job. Very high quality plumbing. Oh, yeah? And you've met him? I didn't just get here. Please, for God's sake! Weren't you up for minister? People always ask me for applications. Of course they do! Speaking of records, are those papers to sign upstairs? Yeah, let's go upstairs. - Let's go. - To listen to this guy. He's coming up! - What is this? - They played me, it was them! You guys are too much. Look, look, look. What could it be? Gallardo! Let's do some dancing! Turn up the music! Gorgeous! Turn up the music, we can't hear shit. Turn it up. Here we go! - Yes? - Manuel. It's Jacobo. Jacobo, what's up? I know it's late but I decided to call you. What happened? Nothing good. - Tell me, tell me. - You're coming out tomorrow. Well, it's Monday already, so Tuesday. What happened? There are recordings. I only know there are recordings. - [ Yeah, but related or not? - ] don't know. What do you fucking know? That they're recent. - 1 don't know. - Don't bullshit me, Jacobo, please. - 1 shouldn't be talking to you. - Yes, I know. And you'll be compensated like always. Who are you thinking of? Someone very close. It looks like someone screwed up or talked too much. That's all I know. I'm hanging up. Good luck. Hello, this is Roberto Gallardo... Morning, don Manuel. Tell her to leave, we have to talk. Tell her to leave, we have to talk. Lorena, honey, please. Go in the bathroom and take a shower. - Go in the bathroom. - Now? Yes, go in the bathroom. - What's wrong? - You talked. - And I hope you didn't mean to. - No, no, no... Who did you talk to about us? I fucking told you. I told you! Did I or not? Relax, Manuel, relax. - Who? - Nobody, Manu. You said nobody so nobody. Think. I am thinking, but no, damn it. No. - I take what you say seriously. - Don't kiss my ass. What do I gain by talking? - If they catch you, they catch me. - Your fucking big mouth got us into this! Think about who you've been talking to this month and about what. Person by person, okay? Including her. And let me know. We're sorry, the number... - What's up, Manuel? - Cabrera. - Have you got a minute? - Or two. Listen, I know you haven't, but have you talked to anyone about us? Nobody. - You sure? - Not sure, Manu, I'm positive. - Not before or after? - Not before, after, never. Okay, big kiss. Call me if you find out anything. I've got to run, bye. You know Alarcon, right? S e 100 - What are you doing here? Two minutes for your sarcasm and start talking. Two minutes is too short. - Good, I'm in a hurry. Who was it? - You'll see tomorrow, Of the mortals. Why is he laughing? Maybe because you walk into this office... You know who I am. Show a little respect... - Just stop it. - I'm more surprised than anyone. Look, Manuel. Either you pissed somebody off, or you were in the wrong place at the wrong time. - Delay it a couple days. - I can't delay it. I can't delay it even one minute. - And this little chat... - I'll be in touch. - Shit for brains. - 1 can't wait! Great, awesome! Someone is looking for trouble. We're sorry, the number you dialed is unavailable at this time. AL SR T RS-? You won't talk to me now? Let me take him upstairs. No, he can go alone. He can go alone! - How did you find out? - What do you care? Of course I care. I have two kids. What has that got to do with anything? - Are you wearing one right now? - No, damn it. How can you do this to me, man? How can you do this to me? - I'm sorry, man. - For who? - For who? - For the police. Since when? Two months, less. You fucking idiot! - You think they won't incriminate you? - I'll pay for my part. - [ Not with that face... - ] was sick of it. - Of having an awesome life! - Shut the fuck up. You fucking idiot! Of making a bundle for doing nothing. Of your wife and kids living in style. What is life to you? I couldn't look them in the eye, I couldn't even sleep. This is about how I divided the Persika share. - What are you talking about? - You wanted more. So now you can look your kids in the eye? Now you can? When your kids find out you sent your friends and their families to prison for a bigger cut... Where are you going? What have they got? You think they tell me anything? You know what you gave them, right? Besides us always meeting in bars and restaurants, I don't know. Look, do they have a lot or a little? What do they have? I think they've got the other day in your office. It was too quiet. I'm sorry, Manu. I really am. I have nothing against you, really. Manu, listen to me. Manu, listen to me. This is José Luis Frias, leave a message. José Luis, call me, it's important. MANUEL LOPEZ-VIDAL NAMED IN CORRUPTION SCANDAL since it could have serious consequences for the party after the recording was leaked of this conversation between one of the party strong men regional Vice-secretary Manuel Lopez-Vidal and a council member from City Hall whose identity hasn't been revealed. (YA =)o What about the other thing? Forget about that. You mean Persika? It's under control. - But we'll get caught. - No, we won't. I talked to Juan Ignacio and I told him: "Cut anything you have to, clean up anything you have to." Stop him, period. Like it's always been done. Land re-zoning and siphoning European Union subsidies for amounts that could reach hundreds of thousands of euros. The vice-secretary will have to face police questioning under "Operation Amadeus” which has been underway for a while now... From now on I want you to tell me everything. I want to know everything. Yes. What do I owe you, José. Right away, maestro. Why did you go into politics? Francisco? - Gentlemen? - What do you mean...? What were you expecting from politics? Hurry up, we came from Madrid just for this. I don't understand the question. What do you want from life, Manuel? Do you understand the question now? Well, from life... Same as everyone, I guess. My family to be okay, to be happy... To get by. Great, you've smashed it all. If you needed something, you should have asked. This party takes care of its own. We'd have given you anything, Francisco, Manuel, with pleasure. But this... This is a disgrace. For the party, our voters and the country. Because we're giving them reasons. How far does your thing go? Only here. Madrid isn't involved. Paco... Your thing in Switzerland? Local, that was local too... That came from the garbage. The garbage when? Well, that started in 2003. In 2003 you were... In territorial politics. - You did this with City Hall? - Of course. With Urban Planning. Who was there at the time? - At City Hall? - Of course. - Where else? - Paco, what's your problem? I don't know how you're spinning this... Were you there or not? And other people did other things. - There you go. - 1 don't see your angle. - Manuel... Manuel! - The things we say here... Calm down. Calm down. Yes, please. Okay, this changes things quite a bit from a rotten apple to an organized gang. With elections next year. Does that enter your mind? Logically. Paco. Your name took a hit. See what we do with you now. Return whatever sum, to begin with... Of course, of course. Manuel, you're out. - Me? - You're out, yes. And before you go, you'll stand up for this party in public. You got caught. - Face up to it. - We got caught. You got caught, face up to it. And they'll keep looking because some people want to come after us thanks to individuals like you. From now on, we want only transparency from you. Can you do that? Now it's the party first, you second. - You got it? - Yes, damn it. If you got it, lose the attitude. I don't know what your notion of politics is, but it's not what you've been doing. You have to set an example and from what I see, you come up short. Well? How does it look? Bad. Frankly bad, really. Relax, it's all a show for that bonehead Alvarado. Well, it looked real with all the party people there... You're getting scared now? - Calm me down. - You're going to have to eat shit. - That's how it is. And by the handful. - Great. - What if more keeps coming out? - We hold the fort. No, not that, the big one. - Persika? - Yes, Persika. No. Persika won't come out, it's impossible. Though you were messy. - How could I have known I was bugged...? - Persika won't come out. I'm telling you that. That would be a huge fucking shitstorm. No. Right now you apply yourself, eat what you're told and wait. Can you be more specific? Sometimes I don't get things. Even more? Are you deaf? So I take the blame for everyone? Including Paco. You're jealous again. The Paco thing is something else, a quick face wash. Wonderful. Fuck! There's one thing you don't know. Take it easy. Let's hear it. There's a job opening in Washington. Very cushy. Does Frias know about this? Great universities for Natividad. Yes, he knows. - What does he say? - Fuck all because it's up to me. I can't believe you're doing this to me, Asun. Screwing my life to keep your kid clean. Are you going stupid on me? Don't bust my balls, I'm saving your ass. Or would you rather... I'm getting the fuck out of here. We'll talk later. - Where did he go? - He's booked solid today. Call him, Manuel. I don't know what to tell you. Manuel, please. Give me that. Will you give it back? Thank you. Good afternoon. We'll treat him and... Would you mind if we talked later? Okay. - Manuel. - What's up? - How are you? - Fine. Is José Luis here? He left ten minutes ago. But how are you? Don't scare me... No, fine, fine. I'm actually here for José Luis. I thought he didn't want anyone to know. Well... You know how he is. - You want to go up? - Please. I think he had an award ceremony... - What are you doing here? - Can we talk? Will you excuse us? Sorry, excuse me. Thank you. I've been calling you for two days. And which part of not answering did you not understand? Mr. Frias, you're next. Yes. - Will you come with me? - Yes. - Don't follow me. - I'll wait and we'll have dinner. - I can't. - You can't or you won't? This is not the place. Are you aware that everybody could go down? I'm aware of more things than you can imagine. Don't call me if I don't answer, don't look at me if I look away. There's obviously a reason more important than your curiosity. Good afternoon. We're going to be coherent, we're going to be transparent, we're going to be responsible. - Hi. - Good evening. - My sister doesn't know. - Call her. Or she'll hear it from someone else. They've been after you for one year, the file is this thick. - Judge? - A woman. Costa. - What did the prosecutor say? - He won't answer. Go to his house after and talk to him. This might not go to trial. I'd rather be prepared. Okay, perfect. Two things then. Simple. - Your father. I'll take it. - Okay. - What two things? - Two things, move the money, if we get rid of the evidence, everything will be fine. Bermejo has supposedly taken care of the first. Do you trust him? No. I was at headquarters all fucking night. Look, you see? All of Persika is here. If they come after me, I can take them down. All of them. Let's see. I don't know if this is a good idea. No, right. Watch thine enemies, especially your fellow party members. Which are worse. - You must have made copies. - Yes, two pen drives. When I'm done I'm going to Madrid to see Ceballos. We'll see if this brings her around. No, she's in Milan. She gets back tomorrow. Damn, that's right. Let's make the most of today. Get me a meeting with Cabrera. - How are we for time? - Good. This part takes forever. - So we're good. - You can't trust Costa, Ramiro. - Did you hear that? - Yeah, don't worry. And the other part? Switzerland? - Fernando? - This Switzerland obsession. How many times have I got to say it? Sending money to Switzerland is tacky! Okay, then. Switzerland is out. What do I do now? What you'd be doing if you hadn't stolen all those papers. First, on a personal note, I am utterly disappointed. This gentleman had all of my trust up until this moment, but anyway, it's in the judges' hands now. José, I'll leave this here. Good morning. Hi, Rafa, what's up? Hi. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Sorry, that's my seat. You can't sit somewhere else? No, there are no more chairs. That's okay, Carlos. I'll find another. And we weren't expecting you. There you have it. In politics you have to improvise. The big problem, the chair. Can you pass me my things, Carlos, please? Thank you. We'll start with next year's budget. Maite, shut the door. Go to where we left off yesterday. The total tax income... When I say it's gone up very little compared to... Sorry... Maite, please. Go have a smoke. - Get the car, I'm leaving. - What's up, Manu? - Shall we go for a beer? - I can't. Will things get better for me? Did they say that? Come on, Manu. A quick one. I have news. No, Paco. - You'd have done the same. - But I didn't. Fuck, Manu, please. You have it easy. Frias worships you. The bastard hates me and you know it. You need to lose that attitude, I'm telling you. - You'll figure it out. - Go fuck yourself. Whatever you say, at least I tried. Sometimes you lose, eh, Manu? Sometimes you lose! What's up? - Antonio, coffee, please. - Right away. How are we, gentlemen? Let's see, Manuel... This is insane. No, this is called security, it's called precaution. The Chinese are insane. It's not a big deal. Not a big deal? Have they named a corruption scheme after your boat? Fuck, no. You don't have a boat. We're playing with the big boys here. Okay, no need to get upset. This part, no way. This commission is abusive. Something you want to say to me? Go ahead. That you've got a lot of nerve. Take it easy, Fernando, okay? Don't talk to me that way. Talk to me right. For me this isn't only business, for me this is a favor I'm doing him with my name already in the papers risking my fucking image and I don't appreciate having - my loyalty to this man questioned. - Okay, relax. Will everyone please calm down? Okay, but tell this guy to get out of my sight. Don't do it. Your lunch is covered. Your coffee. Here we see what looks like a home video of Manuel Lopez-Vidal and his wife with other party members enjoying a celebration on a friend's yacht. How are you? Manu, Manu. - What's going on here? - Mr. Lopez-Vidal. - Good morning. - Good morning. This order is from Judge Costa to detain you and search your home. Excuse me. Mr. Lopez-Vidal, you have a safe, right? Yes. If you'd be so kind... Open the safe and step back, please. Step back. Thank you. It looks like this is going to take a while. - Shall we have breakfast? - Sure, I'll make coffee. - Would anyone like coffee, water? - No, thank you. - Dad they're taking everything... - Nati, it's okay, they're doing their job. They'll leave when everything is clarified, don't worry. Since this is going to take a while, can I get dressed? Of course. There's a call from the courthouse... Excuse me, empty out your pockets on the table, please. - Yes, right away. - Thank you. Can you show me your shoe, please? The other one. I'll take this pen drive. - How did it go. - Good. Text Ceballos. "I have something that interests you, I'm coming to see you." - And get on the Cabrera thing. - I'm on it. Manuel, how are you? How did the night go? Tell Inés to get me a train ticket for 3 o'clock, okay? - Am I on time? - Yes, ahead. Wait by the door. They arrested Gallardo and he hasn't said anything, so relax. You're not going in. - What? - You're fired. - What? - For being clumsy or a traitor? Did I tell you not to keep evidence or did I not? How did they know there were two pen drives? I have no idea. No, you tell me, because I have no idea. - What are you talking about? - Get out of my sight. Come on, come on. - Let's go. - Manuel, listen to me. Fernando, say something, damn it. Is this okay? Good morning. Good morning. - We can get started, right? - Yes, sorry. - My new lawyer. - Okay. You've been informed of your rights while detained, - right? - Yes. And you are Don Manuel Lopez-Vidal? - I am. - Correct. Has carried out an investigation revealing clear indications of crimes of misconduct, repeated tax fraud, repeated bribery, malfeasance, forgery, competition rigging and influence trafficking. - Do you wish to make a statement? - No. - The prosecution? - Then we don't either. Parties, you may proceed. The prosecution requests pretrial detention due to the risk of destroying evidence and danger of escape. The defense opposes, ma'am. We request he be given parole due to my client's family and social roots and the impossibility to alter evidence after the search. I hereby apply preventable temporary custody with bail set at 200,000 euros. You must turn in your passport and check in at the courthouse every two weeks. The court agent will provide the allegations - in writing. - Correct. Correct. Yes, of course. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Shouldn't you talk to someone first? - To who? - 1 don't know! José Luis. - I can't talk to anyone. - But are you going to jail or not? - 1 don't know! What questions you ask! You know what happened last night? Ana called me and told me. Remember Marina, Anselmo's wife? From Persika? - Yeah, from accounting. - She's dead. Her car went off the road and she's dead. - Maybe it wasn't an accident. - Jesus Christ, Inés! Just calm down. Of course it was an accident. I want us to keep deciding things together. - I'll call you from the train to explain. - No, explain it now. - When I get to Madrid... - Explain it to me now! - 1 can"t! - Why can"t you? Because you got me a fucking ticket for a train leaving in 40 minutes! You! I'll call you from the train. I'll call you when I get to Madrid tonight, okay? Listen to me. I'll explain everything when I get back tonight. If I can't come, I'll call you. I'll call you and call you, okay? MESSAGE FROM CEBALLOS: DON'T COME - Manuel. - Asuncion. What can we do for you? I came to talk to you. You'll have to wait because these people and I are working. That's fine, I can talk right here in front of them if you want. Well, Manuel, don't make a fool of yourself. I wanted to talk about Persika... - 1 can't believe this, Manuel. - Neither can I, baby. We'll continue after, please. Rodrigo, give us a couple of minutes. I think I should stay. That's fine with me, eh? Just fine. This will take two seconds, Rodrigo, please. Two seconds. If you don't mind. You are such an idiot! I warned you. You brought up Persika in front of him! I've got him sniffing my snatch all day long. Please, let me speak. You must be mentally retarded. Will you let me talk already? I swear on my daughter I'll blow you up. - You're going to blow me up? - Yes, you and everyone. What shit are you talking? - Shall we ask Alvarado? - Ask whoever you fucking like. Look, either we make a deal right now or I'll hop in a taxi and go drink wine with the press. How about it? With the press. Go home to your daughter instead of swearing so much. There was another pen drive. - What are you talking about? - Made another copy. - And where is it? - In Madrid. Madrid is very big. Show me. You'll see it from the fucking witness stand, unless you take me seriously, we make a deal and forget how badly we all get along, your plans with Paco, mine with Frias and we talk about the future. The party won't recover from this. Think it over. Drop it already. You have nothing. You're alone and you're screwed. You should have listened when you had the chance. Out. You're making a mistake. Watch the news the next few days. See what you find. Your Yrama=aki. What are you doing? Don't stop. - Alvarado, please. - Don't follow me. I need to talk to you for a second. Only for a second, really. Keep going, I'll be right there. - What's up? - Just give me five minutes. I'll call you right now. Rodrigo Alvarado Urrea, law degree with honors, National Court Judge on leave, General Vice-Secretary of the party, married, two daughters. Not bad for under 40, but you're not the first. - 1 don't pretend to be. - Hey, please! Saint Rodrigo, Patron Saint of the Honest. Coming from you, that sounds - like an insult. - Okay, look. I'm here to help you pad your resume. Do you really think I need you for that? That depends. Do you want to be regional president of the party? Life is funny, huh? We all thought it would be you. - And look at me now. - No, I'm not the least bit interested. Besides, I think Frias has plenty of rope left. PR N e\ To Sure, probably. Throat cancer. Nobody knows. The heir to the realm is Paco. And I'm offering you his head. Asuncion won't be... amused at all, R E G pinning the Swiss accounts on you. I'm glad you noticed. I'm saying no, I don't think the party needs any more scandals. But I'm giving Paco's scandal only to you SO you can manage it. What a bunch of gangsters. Look, I won't get out of a trial. That's right, I'm going to need you and you know it. Yeah, but I still don't work miracles. But you know how to polish the prosecution. What you're asking is complicated. Less for you. Look, imagine I could help you, that I can recuse an unpleasant judge and get you one a little nicer, that I'm tempted by the idea of moving to the beach... Tell me, why the hell would I deprive myself of the true pleasure of seeing you go to prison? Because what I did was nothing special, man. What did I do? Survive? N What did I do? Fit into a machinery that's been greased since my grandfather's days. History won't remember me, that's fine. But I want the best for my wife and daughter. Good lord, how many ways can you tell the same story? You just got here, kid. Don't overestimate yourself. Alvarado, I understand perfectly if you say no to me right now, I understand perfectly. But months will go by and I won't be in the spotlight anymore. And until the trial, whenever you have a beer like now, you're going to remember this conversation. And that you can spare yourself four years of Ceballos. And that if you really want to change things, if you really want to change things, in the real world, this is how it's done. And with power. No, not like this. Not like this. Then how? Impressive, eh? You think you can convince me. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure? Because I already have. - Hi. - What's up? - Come in. - Thank you. Come in, come in. - Have a seat. - Okay. - Vodka then? - Yes, please. Just a little. - Like that? - Thanks. Was dinner business or pleasure? You're leaving the morning show? I don't know. Everything looks good, but... The shinier the offer, the less I trust it. You think there's a catch?? Power protects power. Why did you invite me here? I missed my train back. And I thought, why not? I shouldn't be here. But here you are. You think you know me well. I'm good at seeing people. - ( Oh, yeah? B ) Shall we try? Okay, go ahead. You love your job. Too much. But it's okay because you're very good. Very good. Smart, hardworking, with your feisty touch. But you still need one thing to be taken seriously. - A penis? A good story. You're going to give it to me? If you wait for me, yes. I'm awful at waiting, you know that. To patience. Keep going? Come on. - This is Rodrigo Alvarado... - Fuck. Give me change. Tell me what I owe you. Your change. This is Rodrigo Alvarado... - Who's that? - Lturralde, Ceballos' lawyer. The record shows that my client, Roberto Gallardo Antlunez, will cooperate with the prosecution to clarify the details he can offer about the so-called Amadeus Scheme which we hope will be considered when judging his specific case. This cooperation sustains that my client was an accomplice but never creator, instigator and/or active agent within the scheme. The other defendant present, Manuel Lopez-Vidal, was in fact creator, instigator and the brains behind the scheme as proven in the adjoined evidence. My client, Roberto Gallardo Antlunez, wants the record to show that Manuel Lopez-Vidal's was to appropriate and distribute a percentage of subsidies from Brussels destined to maintain agricultural lands bought previously by front men. - After the land was re-zoned... - Excuse me. lturralde, can you provide the defense with this evidence? After the land was re-zoned and designated urban, the land was sold to builders for a price up to 100 times greater per hectare, so we're looking at double embezzlement perpetuated for years. Here's the Persika thing. Everything's changed but my name. - Can we continue? - Yes, of course. Thank you. My client sustains that he was present at scheme meetings at different locations in the city and suburbs. Show that Manuel Lopez-Vidal was present at all of them. Including: Las Arenas Hotel conference hall, located at 22 Vifas Street, the Green Village Country Club, located at 7 Mercaderes Street, the Aphrodite Club, kilometer 13 of National Highway 3, - the Pink Paradise Club, kilometer 37... - 1 think that's enough. - Please let him finish. - Sorry. Thank you. The Pink Paradise Club, kilometer 37 of National Highway 1, the Doll Club, kilometer 41 of National Highway 2, El Torredn Grill, 91 Maestre Gonzalbo Street, Casa Sherezade, on Los Robles Avenue... Inés, listen to me. You just got played and it's only a sample of what they can do. You have to call José Luis. Look, I'm sorry about what just happened, but it's all a lie. They're going to throw a lot of shit to discredit me. Don't believe any of it. That's for me to decide. You focus on what's urgent. It's 3 weeks to trial, call José Luis and do whatever you have to. Before this gets worse, because it will. The taxi. You're not coming? No, I'm leaving alone. See you at home? Come on. Mr. Lopez-Vidal? Did you cooperate with the prosecution? Did you talk about any other party members implicated? Thank you very much. We keep going tomorrow, right? - Yeah, of course. - Okay. It's in the other one. Oh, thanks. Nati, I'm going to make a call, okay? He's with his daughter. This is Rodrigo Alvarado, leave a message... This is Rodrigo Alvarado, leave a message... Alvarado, there are 3 weeks left and I'm fucking sick and tired of looking for 1 euro coins to try and talk to you. You've had plenty of time, just tell me: yes or no. Can we go, please? - Did they say something? - No, they didn't. - Nati, look at me. Did they? - No, they didn't. Did you hear it? - Did you spit at us? - Spit what? - He spit on the ground. - They spit at us. - Check and see. - They did not spit at us. - Did you spit at me? - Dad, he didn't spit at you. You spit at me. Spit in my face if you have the balls! - You have no manners. - Manners, he says, the thief. Hey! I didn't steal from anyone, you got that? - Brat! - A thief and a whoremonger! - You people disgust me! - Dad... - Come on. - What? - What did you say? - Go on, scram. Dad, let's go! We're leaving! Look at me, Dad, look at me! Dad, please, look at me! Get the fuck out of here! I'll stomp your head! That's enough! You want to sit down? Would you like something to drink? Nobody knows this, but... I'm going to give you a chance. The last one. A chance to what? To end well. That's not why you called me. You'll never change, will you? You don't deserve your wife, she's smart, not like you. And she's right, sometimes it's better to be a Gallardo. - You are who you are. - And you're an arrogant bastard. - Me, arrogant? - Yes. Arrogance, this country's evil. - Arrogance breeds treason. - Treason is not doing what you're told. And you never did. You haven't learned anything, have you? You still haven't realized this is how bad news begins? - Answer it. - No, it doesn't matter. Go ahead, answer it. OKAY. YOU HAVE ONE WEEK. FROM R. ALVARADO There it is. That arrogant glow in your eyes. You know me well, huh? Like my own son. Well, I'm not your son. They don't play around, they're serious! Are you threatening me? What do you mean by that, José Luis? That I might have an accident? Will my car go off the road? What the fuck are you saying? Have the balls to say it! What are you saying? You're not my responsibility anymore, Manuel. What happened? Airline tickets and enough dollars. I talked to your sister. When you get to Toronto, she'll pick you up tomorrow, okay? I can't believe it. All you had to do was listen. Ines, please. This is hard for me too. Take it, it's for the best. - It's hard for you too. - Yes. - Sure. - Yes. - All for pride. - Inés, please. Where are you going? To pack your daughter's suitcase. - It's not pride, Ines! It's justice! We can go alone from here. Take care. I'll call you, okay? Cedrun, Caceres, Aguado, ST TR T VW Aragon, Nayim, Poyet, Higuera, Pardeza and Esnaider. Talk while you eat. Like you're giving a speech, not just names. I'd put Cedrun in the goal. Wings, Chucho Solana and Belsué, who saved a goal in the first half. On the right, the man who forever changed history with his right foot... Okay! Cedran, Caceres, Aguado, NIEU N SR Aragén, Nayim, Poyet, Higuera, Pardeza and Esnaider. Excuse me. Could you turn down the music a bit? Yes, Luis, what is it? Sorry, man. Something came up and I can't go. You're kidding. I have to finish something here in the office, I have 15 minutes - to eat before the Chinese come. - Tomorrow. I'm going to Belmopan first thing, I told you that, damn it. Luis, I need to talk to you, it's very important. Fuck, let's see. Next week, at the end of next week. I'll find you a spot, you're first in line. I swear on my youngest daughter's life. Or we'll talk - on the phone. - No. Are you in your office? I said yes, I'm in my office. - I'll be there in 10 minutes. - There's no time, the Chinese! I'll be there in 5 minutes, really. Here, keep the change. - Good afternoon. - Afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. There are still some tactical issues we need to work on. - It's impossible. Afternoon. - Good afternoon. I'm running first territory now, university students. Awesome. - Goodbye. - Bye. Hi. Hi. - Are you going down? - No, going up. He's expecting me. - Lots of people see you? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes. Let nobody in! You can't do this to me, gorgeous, it's not good to be seen here. You want some rice? I have plenty. Keeps you from shitting. Five minutes, Manuel. What can I do for you? The Chinese will be here TR N G You can't wait one fucking week? What can I do for you? Either you're having a stroke or you're fucking with me. What the fuck do you want? Hey! YOU HAVE MICROPHONES IN HERE I needed to talk to you. Where can we? - How do you know? - They're investigating a lot of people. - Since how long? - At least a month. - I've heard recordings. - Of me? Yeah. Here, of you, me... How could they have bugged my fucking office? This is too big, they need more heads to roll. And now they're coming after me? After me? After me? Look who they're not going after: Ceballos, Frias or Paco. I've been there for them the whole time! Fuck, when Alex made that whole mess at the convent, I was there and this is how they thank me. Recordings don't always hold up in court. They can't. We're businessmen, damn it! Trying to do things right. You pay, or you pay. That's how it works here. What kind of fucking shitty country is this? - For them it's easy. - For who? The party. AR. It's Frias, that fat son of a bitch. The faggot hates me. - He has it in for me. - Not just him. He's never, never shaken my hand. No, he did once, remember? You were in front of Rojas and Serrano when I named them presidents of whatever the fuck it was. That's the only time he shook my hand. But when you and Paco ate shit with the Persika crap, who did they call, Manuel? Bermejo. All terrified: "We have to hide it all in Andorra." And there I was, Manuel. Taking it all to Andorra in a fucking police helicopter. Yeah, you did. And this is how they thank me. That's right. Shit, the Chinese. (VI Where the fuck do I take the Chinese? - You know why this is, right? - No. Because they don't see us as equals. They fucking have it in for us. Me because I never finished my degree and you because of where you're from. That's it, they resent us. You know what Paco calls you? "The Money Grabber." He said it once in front of me. "Cabrera the Money Grabber." Me, The Money Grabber? Paco the Gypsy? And where did the Gypsy come from, eh? The Gypsy... If it weren't for Ceballos... that son of a bitch would be wiping my ass while I shit all over him! He's the one who should be looking for bugs under his desk. But too bad. That conniving asshole is always up to something. And he makes off with the money. It was his idea, in that fucking convent. What year was it? In '97. And he was completely drunk. Re-zoning the land... Fucking bastard. This isn't going to change. Nothing will ever change around here. You always have to fucking pay in life. You always have to pay. And when things get ugly, who do they call? Yours truly. And the Gypsy opens his hand. Nobody in the fucking world is better at it. Nobody! What did he say about Brussels? "If they want our peaches, they can eat my balls first." Son of a bitch. I don't think it's fucking funny. Let's go. If you find out anything, we'll meet. Don't call me. Paco. - How are you? - What's he doing here? - None of your business. - Shut up. What were you doing? Offer the Chinese some coffee, if you don't mind. Don't bullshit me. What did you two talk about exactly? Nothing much. - Manuel wants to move some money... - Some money. You are really something else. Paco, what I will politely ask you - is to calm down. - Calm down? Yeah, sure. Let's calmly discuss what you two need to discuss. But for God's sake, not here. Susi, you tell him. He's right, this is not the place. Let's talk in the office. Right, Manu? I'd rather not do it in the office. I'll buy you a drink downstairs. No, everyone will see how dumb their boss is. - You'll have to excuse me. - Nobody's going anywhere. - Take off your jacket. - No, no. - Did you search him, you jerk? - You're going to search me now? - Yes. - What, are you a cop now? - I want to see what you've got there. - I'm sorry, but I'm leaving. You're not going anywhere. Stay right there. - Don't touch me. - Of course I will. Don't touch me! Get your fucking hands off me. - Hey! - What's this? Look. You guys see this? I can't believe it, Manu. What do I do with you now? What do I do with you? Tell me. Tell me what to do with you! You're finished! You son of a bitch! Get out of here, you bastard! I'll kill you! Did you see that? Yeah. Break it, just in case. Maybe it's time to stop. - No. - Well, then? I have a week to give Alvarado something. We have to go to Andorra for Bermejo's money. How much have I got? How much can we move? - It depends. What for? - For a plumber. - Who is he? A new one. To do what? Find Bermejo's safety deposit box in Andorra. Then we' "bribe whatever b. Tell me, how much? A lot. I can't get that much money in one day. - How are you? - Fine. It's very cold. Nati, little by little. She's having fun with her cousins. Ines... I'm calling because I need money, practically all of it. And I can't promise I'll pay you back soon. But I really need it, otherwise... I don't know what will happen. That money isn't all yours. - It's also your daughter's. - 1 know. Look, I don't want to argue. Tell me how much and how to do it. But I will tell you one thing: I never kicked you out or left you with nothing. I've always treated you with respect and love because you've always been what matters most to me. How do we do it? Thanks. Look, Manu. It's better if Estrada calls you. Don't call me anymore, you got that? Never again. I'll contact you if I need to, all right? How are you, man? Okay. Pass me the backpack. It's all in there. Are you the ones who... They'll call you. - But... - They'll call you. 3 days, 5... Okay, this is all set. Have they called? - What's up? - Not much. I know a guy at Credit Andorra who looks soft enough, but... Who knows. I heard about one at Andbank who isn't a sure thing either. Is at the Privada, Curro's there, he's an old client of mine, and we'd better avoid Morabanc, they have a grudge with me. If you had to pick one? If it's Bermejo, then... at Andbank or Credit. (= =4 - It's me. - 1 was missing you. - It's almost done. - I'll believe it when I see it. - It got messy but it's almost done. No, I heard about the show you put on. Don't worry, you can set my thing in motion. Sorry to repeat myself, but I'll believe it when I see it. Look, there's only one week left and it's not enough time. Until it's in my hands, forget it, is that clear? - What? - It's not in a bank. It's not in a bank? That's Bermejo's daughter. - ( Who, the blonde? B ) I can't see anything. - The blonde, Lucia. - Yeah? Look at the little house "The Lady" was building this whole time. Follow me. Lucia, it's Manuel Lopez-Vidal. Manuel, your father's friend. - What's going on? - Sorry but he sent us to pick something up. It's urgent, really. It will only take a couple minutes. Please, open the door. Okay. Hi, Lucia. I'm sorry. Your father didn't say anything? No, nothing. There was a problem and he sent us over to pick up some documents. It should only take a couple minutes. Can we come in? - Yes. - Thank you. What's up? Nice little private party you got here. - Does your father know? - No. Well, don't worry. What do you need exactly? Some documents that were where, in a folder or on a hard drive? Yeah, he said a hard drive. - On a hard drive. - Can we have a quick look? Sure. L[H W. - Everything okay? - Fine, yeah. It's cool. Sorry, Lucia. It's only a couple minutes. - You won't tell my dad, right? - Please. Thank you. Fernando, look over there. Hi. They're friends of my dad's, they're leaving. - It's cool, you can keep doing that. - It's cool. - Nothing. - Is there anything upstairs? - There's a bedroom, but it's locked. - We'll take a look. It might be there. Shall we? Thanks. Check in back just in case, Fernando. - What's going on? - Nothing, they need to get something. I'm really sorry about this. Your dad will fill you in. - Okay. - It's a problem... - It's that room over there. - Wow. I didn't see a thing, eh? You're right, it's locked. - There must be a key. - No. No, no. Look, we know it has to be in there because it's the only locked room, right? My father told me that door couldn't be opened. Sure, he said that because it has important things, documents, which is exactly why I'm here, because your father asked me to come for the documents. So please, find me the key, okay? There must be one. - Lucia, please, go find the key. It's late. - 1 don't have a key to open that. A key, anything. - Fernando, come up. It's here. - I'm coming. Who is he? Hey! Are you crazy? - I need those documents. - Okay. Fine, but we have a problem here, life isn't always a party. - You don't need to kick the door... - Good. I know what I need to do. Look, here she is. Don't get smart with me. Give me the keys, Lucia, please. Let's see... Fuck. - Why wouldn't he come himself? - He's at a congress, you know that. - And why didn't he give you the key? - Good question, why didn't he? Fernando, we'll have to break the door down. - No, you can't do that. - Lucia, this is the situation: We need the documents for your father, if you want I'll call him right now at 4 in the morning, he's been sleeping for 3 hours, after a shitty day and tell him that we can't get what he asked for because his daughter won't let us break this fucking door! This stupid fucking door! Calm down, please. We need to find a toolbox to open this. Lucia, will you help your father and find a toolbox or something to open this? Thank you, thank you. Let's see a little activity. I don't know, maybe with an ID card. - With an ID card? - Find a crowbar or something. Find something I can use to pry it open. - I'm not moving, I'm fine right here. - Find it yourself. I'll go. It's there, Fernando. Hey, what are you doing? Lucia, come up here. Fernando, go to the car. - You don't want me to help? - No, this will only take a minute. Okay... Okay, Manuel. Look. He's lying. Hold on, she's coming up. Did you buy tickets to see this? Is this being shown live or what the fuck? I'm trying to work here, kid. Mind your own business, go snort a line downstairs. Let me do what Lucia's father asked me to do. Okay? Shut your fucking mouth! No, I won't shut up, damn it. This house isn't yours or mine. The owner is coming upstairs... Holy shit! Lucia, Lucia, come upstairs! - Hold on, just relax. - What the fuck did you do? - I'll clean this up. - This guy isn't friends with your dad. They're fighting because of the Amadeus Scheme, look. Did you hear that? - Relax, Lucia. - Stop for a second. Hey, please, stop! Lucia, take it easy... Don't touch me! Don't touch me! - Don't touch me! - You guys, stop. - Nobody touches me. - Everybody stop, I'm calling my dad. - Go ahead, call him. - Okay. He's not answering. - He's not answering. - Why? Because he's asleep. Why is he asleep? Because he sent me to pick up documents that are important to him. Why couldn't I get them? Because your stupid ass friends are in my fucking way and won't let me fucking work! Call him again, until he picks up. Don't touch anything! - She said not to touch anything. - Don't touch me! Don't fucking touch me. Let me work, damn it. - You're not leaving. - Great, yeah. - Perfect. - Good. Get a job as a security guard. - She said not to touch anything. - Would you brats let me think? Can you wait until Lucia comes back? Don't fucking touch anything! - Here it is, here it is. - What? What I was looking for. Keep quiet. Here we go, damn it. You wouldn't let me... Let's clean this up, come on. You want to help Lucia? Clean this up, please. Come on, we're in a hurry. - Would you guys clean up? - I'll help you. Okay, thank you. Would you guys please help out? Hey, I'm watching you... Hey! What's the problem? Don't touch me! Don't touch me... I'll kick your ass, you dumbshit. Don't touch me. What's going on here? - What's going on? - Can we all just relax? He stays until you talk to your dad. Nobody's going anywhere. Not you, not you, nobody, until I talk to my dad. Does your dad know you're here? - Of course he does. - I'll give him a message. I'll say you're here with guys twice your age who brought cocaine and that one is about to fuck a minor. You want me to tell him that? Or maybe I should tell my friend Emilio Pino, the federal police chief. Abusing a minor. Calm down, first of all, - a minor is 15 years old. - In Andorra too? You know what? I'm going to call the police. I'll say that 3 guys almost my age have been stealing, molesting... Those two have been stealing. Look, that one. He just took 500-euro bills from your father. Abusing minors and stealing. Should I call the police or leave with my documents? Should I call the police? Thank you. Will you let me through? You'll hear it from your father. Will you let me through? Let me through? Let me through. Would you please get out of the way? Help me. - Are you okay? - Yeah, let's go. Look. "Asun C." Ceballos is in here. Here, JLF. Frias too. FC, Francisco Castillo. Look, Persika, the ones in Madrid. This is too big for Alvarado. We need to give this to the media. His name comes up a lot. If he's in there, everyone is. Power companies, construction, pharmaceuticals, media companies, banks, everything and from everywhere. Not only one party. This will shatter everything, Fernando. - We can't do it. - Why not? It would destroy a country. This isn't just a political party anymore. Let's go to Madrid. We can't go back home. They're going to come after us. No, they won't. We have the information. Fernando, we have the information. When this gets out, this is our life insurance. We're untouchable. Bermejo will know everything by now. Fernando. Look at me. That's enough. Go home. Really. They've got nothing against you. I'll say that I tricked you. Let's go to the station, you take the first train home and forget all this, okay? No, no. I'd rather go with you. No shit. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Let's go to Madrid. Whatever you say. Just... let me call Rosa so she won't worry. Can we stop there? I have to go to the bathroom. Good evening. - The bathroom, please? - In back. Did an elegant older gentleman come in here? Coffee, please. I'm going to the bathroom. Charge me. Come on, Fernando, pick up. The number you dialed is not available at this time... - Hi. - Hi. How are you doing? Fine, here in the workshop. I see. Is everything okay? Are you okay? You look tired. - It was rough. - Rough, he says. It will go fine, you'll see. See you in a few. Good evening. We've announced it all week and it's finally time. Today we're here with Manuel Lopez-Vidal, a household name over the last few months, accused of being the brains behind and main beneficiary of the Amadeus Scheme. The trial begins in a few days, but he's here, with us, with the media for the first time and he's promised he has plenty to tell. We will begin in a few moments. - Good evening, Manuel Lépez-Vidal. - Good evening, Amaia. By now the whole country knows what you say is in those ledgers. That's right, we can find the names of high party officials getting paid... Cash bonuses in exchange for favors, we've heard on the news, yes. But what Spanish people are asking is why here? Why aren't you in court presenting those ledgers as evidence with an open case of your own? Well, obviously I will present this information in a court, there's no way around that, but first I want to make sure that citizens and the media are aware of these facts. You don't trust the legal system? That's a delicate question. Let's say that I've lost trust in many people Are you aware that some people think that what you're after with all this is revenge against - your fellow party members? - I'm aware of that, but I'm not worried because when these ledgers see the light, the chips will fall. There you heard it, Manuel Lopez-Vidal Is not worried. The chips will fall after the commercial. We'll be back in 30 seconds. - Okay, 30 seconds... - Okay, we're out. You started a little rough, didn't you? Amaia, please, after she leaves hold the notebook up to the camera. Juanlu, give me a close-up. Okay, let's see it. Are you listening? Juanlu, close-up. A little higher. Okay, but... Right there, perfect. You see it here, right? Okay. Okay, thank you. Back in ten... Ready? - Five, four... - Okay, let's do it. We're back with Manuel Lopez-Vidal. You claim that revealing these names and their activities would cause a political tsunami of a magnitude never seen in democracy. I'm convinced, start reading any time. How much have you received in exchange for favors? Your name is here as well. In fact, at a glance I think I saw it twice. Of course my name is there along with other high party officials. Yes, but answer the question, please. Many of our viewers might not be taking you seriously. What should I answer first, the question or the insult? I didn't insult you, Mr. Lopez-Vidal. Mrs. Marin, I think you want to divert attention away from the ledger. You won't answer the question? - Okay, my answer is I don't remember. - You don't remember? No, but we can open that ledger and calculate it if you want. You either don't want to or they won't let you. Please, don't insinuate things you can't prove. All right, next question. How long have you known about your party's activities? Since almost when I joined in May of 1993. Nearly 15 years. And you claim that party leaders are in this ledger Absolutely. Also the party president and candidate for president of the government? He is, and believe me, if we open that ledger and show it to the camera, - you'll see that... - Mr. Lopez-Vidal... Here's something I noticed, why is it whenever a citizen goes on television with clear, convincing information which attacks those in power, why all the problems? Maybe someone was right when they said once that power protects power. Ring a bell? What do you want, an award for coming here? Good, good. Look, I've had private security for 2 weeks because they tried to kill me, my family had to leave Spain, I'm living without my wife and daughter. I risked my life, literally, to bring those ledgers here for all of Spain to see and instead of doing your job, you're playing at being a star reporter. I don't want an award, you know that, I want to be heard. Will you handle that? Yes, I will, Mr. Lopez-Vidal. - Perfect. - But what's hard to handle is a normal citizen, like you just called yourself, being invited in September of 1998 with his wife on a trip to Jordan by the president of the company that had just won a contract to build an airport in your community. It's also hard to handle that in May of 2002 you bought a Joaquin Sorolla valued at... Are you here to humiliate me or to say something interesting? I'm told we have to cut to commercial, but yes, first I'll try to say something interesting. I don't buy the national hero facade you insist on wearing when the rest of us have to accept, understand and forgive a fellow "normal" citizen who has been stealing money that belonged to all of us for 15 years. Okay, we have to cut to commercial. We'll be right back with Manuel... We're not cutting to commercial. I'll walk out of here with those ledgers. Maybe in your party you used to say when things happen, but not here. We're not cutting, I'll leave with the ledgers. Tell them in the booth, if they hit that button, I'll get up, take these ledgers and go home. And nobody will see what everyone wanted to see. Well? Those are the consequences! Are we cutting to commercial or not? Amaia, it's up to you. Do what you want. You're going to think about it. I bet they're doing the same in the booth. That's great, because meanwhile I would like to point out something about your attitude that really stands out to me. - My attitude? - 1 don't know whether to classify it as ignorance or hypocrisy. - You're disrespecting me, sir. - No, no, no. I'll explain and everyone will understand. - Okay, then, show us all. - You know and won't say that although this is your show, you have a boss, Armando Pla, the president of this channel, who has another boss, José Manuel Zafra, the delegate adviser of the communications group And they have other bosses, the partners and shareholders who are the real owners of all this. I've had lunch and dinner with some of them on many occasions. And you know what? All these gentlemen really care about is the financial health of the IBEX 35. And yes, that this self-denominated "voice of the people" show perform its function. Shall I say what that function is or do you want to? To make people angry, but just enough for the IBEX gentlemen, all 3 of them, to keep their jobs forever and ever, amen. And yes, it's true, I'm part of that goal. I and a lot of people like me feed that system, it's true. But you do too, Mrs. Marin. You're nothing but an instrument perfectly designed by the same people I'm trying to unmask in vain, so if you don't mind, let's get to the point. Either we show the ledgers or cut to commercial and witness your professional suicide on live television. Do you regret it? What do you mean? Well, I'm imagining the last 15 years of your life. When you'd get home and see your family. Did you think...? Of course I regret it, otherwise I wouldn't be here. No, I worded the question badly. I'm looking for analysis, not regret. You just analyzed the situation for me and I'm grateful. That's why I don't think it takes much courage to apologize here publicly, that's way too easy. You know what the problem is? There are a lot of people like you. A lot. Too many. And I feel like our only hope to keep more people like you from coming back is through analysis and reflection. So answer me this: During the last 15 years of your life, while you were stealing and living like a king, did you ever stop to think about what you were doing? That your daughter has grown up thinking what you do was normal? Or even that it's something reserved for very few. Those who are worthy, the smartest. Answer me, please. Because I can't imagine someone as smart as you not stopping to think about it, and if you have, if you have, I can't imagine you sleeping well every night with such a life. So please, answer me this: Have you ever stopped to think, for one second in your life, a moment, in all this time, about what you were doing?
