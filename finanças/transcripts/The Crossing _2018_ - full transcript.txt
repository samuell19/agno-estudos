Wait! Hurry! What took you so long? Hurry! Come back here you two! You're late. Come here. Miss. - My foot hurts. - My belly hurts. What's wrong with you two? Fill out this form. Quick! Guys, line up here. Let's have a look at this equation. How do we solve this problem? This angle is 35 degrees, equals… E and C So what is E and C, if this is 6 cm here? Hey, how much would this cost? Thirty. Add 6 cm here. Don't forget to bring your homework in tomorrow. All rise! See you all tomorrow! - See you tomorrow, Miss! - See you. It's Liu Zipei's birthday today! - Really? - Buy as many as you can! 20% discount on all phone cases! Two for $70 and one for $40. They are not good. Yes, they are. You don't have to buy them. Please pay. This one is in stock. I'll give you tomorrow. Let's mark it down first. - Give me change. - Okay. There you go. A few dollars on Taobao. You're selling it for $40. What a rip off! It includes labor costs. You can go get it yourself! Let's split. No refund once you have opened it. Sorry, no refund. This one is $20. How much did we make? About $150. Add that to what you've already earned. Should be enough right? I'm booking the hotel! Look, I've chosen this one. See this tatami area. And the sliding doors are over here. You go in through here. Come over here! As soon as you go through the entrance, you can see the snow-capped mountains. And here you have the cherry trees, they are as beautiful as I am. Since it's winter, there's no cherry blossom. But everything is covered in snow. Then we step back. - And then we take off our clothes! - What? We're going to the hot springs. Look! It's snow! Falling gently like cherry blossom petals. What amazing sake this is! - What does it taste like? - Sweet, I think. I don't know. It must be expensive. Maybe you should book the hotel after I book the flight. But we're going during Christmas! Everything will be fully booked soon. You can pay me back later. No hurry. - How can I help you? - Are you hiring part-time staff? Liu Zipei. You turned 16 today? So I can hire you then. We pay standard minimum wage. That's $32,5 an hour. - How many hours can I do per day? - That depends on you. If I work for five hours, I'll get… It'll be $162,50. It's the same all over Hong Kong. - When can you start? - Today. - Let's give it a try then. - Okay. Hey. You're new here? What are you doing? You don't need to handle the trash. Get back to work. -Ask the server. Do something! - Sure, no worries. It should be here, right? My ring is very expensive. You have no idea. You cleaned that table, didn't you? -It's not there. - Have you checked your bag? How could it disappear? Don't worry. The customers are always like that. Go ask your server. I hope we can catch the last bus home. Where do you live? Far away. You're very young. You must need the money badly. Today's pay. See you. - Hey. - Hey. - You're here. - Yeah. It's really late. Have you eaten? Yes. Good luck to you. - You're a big girl now, so be good. - Thanks, dad. Keep it safe. Don't let your mom see it. Come, have some tea. Put it away. Spend it wisely. What else do you want? I'm thinking at Christmas… Hello? Seven million? How much can we get on the mortgage? Didn't your mom say she knew someone? The agent fees already set us back $70,000. Let's talk when I get back. - I'll head back, dad. It's getting late. - Right. You need to catch the last bus. Don't come here so late next time. It's not safe. I got a part-time job. You shouldn't be working. You should focus on school. Then you should focus on eating healthy. No more instant noodles. I'll be off then. Really? Let's go to Spain and play Mahjong there! Yes, let's go to Spain! Have some fruit! Don't put it here. We're playing Mahjong. Peipei, you're back? Hey, Peipei. You're getting prettier. That's because she looks more and more like me. Hey! Mind your manners! Leave it. There are dumplings on the table, if you're hungry. I've got something to do so I'll get going. Enjoy your game. Don't forget to bring us a mop each. - Take care. - Okay. Thanks! Heyden, have you finished your homework yet? I regret having children in Hong Kong now. Their homework is in traditional Chinese and English. I don't understand it. I can't help my own child with his homework. How come Peipei never asked for help? - You're lucky. - Yeah, I am. Hi, Melissa. This is Liu Zipei's domestic helper. Sorted! It's time for the cake! Where are the cigarettes? Here comes the cake! Happy Birthday, Hui! - Make a wish. - Make a wish! This year I want a girlfriend to warm my feet. It's her birthday today too! - I don't… - Cool! Let's celebrate together. Come on, make a wish! I hope it snows in Hong Kong. If it snowed, Hong Kong wouldn't be this hot. You two should toast each other. She doesn't drink. I'll drink it. Kiss him! Peipei! She doesn't drink. I'll drink it for her. No way! Or she has to jump into the water! Into the water! - I've taken the drink for her. - That doesn't count. Into the water you go! Take off your clothes! Into the water! Peipei! Hold on to me. Don't ever show off like that if you can't swim. Are you alright Peipei? You really jumped into the water? Why don't you come in? - Come on! - Nope! Watch out! Bring more girls along later. See you in Mongkok. Eight. - Did you have a good time, Hui? - It was a blast! We'll carry on later. Don't let him leave. - Japan here I come! - How much do I owe you? Leave it. Take her to my car over there. - What about you? - I'll be there in a bit. Watch her! Don't fall into the water. Look at you! Are you feeling sick? Be careful. - Call me when you're there. - Okay. How is she? That's enough. It's your fault she drank so much. Let's go and sing karaoke. I'm going to the hot springs in Japan. - My plane! Where's my plane? - Here's your plane. Time to board now. Put her seat belt on. Don't let her throw up. The car isn't mine. - Why aren't you boarding? - There's no room for her. We have school tomorrow. - You're Cinderella. - Do you know where she lives? Stop talking. Let's go. Be careful. Bye! TO SHENZHEN You! Come over here. Yes, you! - What's the matter? - Open your bag. Regular inspection. I've just been to Hong Kong for dinner. There are only clothes in it. Please open the bag for inspection. Sir, I'm in a hurry. I'll miss my flight. Stop! Hey! Stop! Stop! Hello? Hey, it's me. How did you get my number? You have my stuff, don't you? Don't touch the contents. I'll give it to Jo tomorrow. I'll text you an address, and you take it there tomorrow. - That's right. - Fire? A fire is a good omen. - I'm going to get rich. - You should worship for yourself. - How about another round this evening? - No, I've got business to do. - Getting cold feet? - That's not true. I'll be there. - Deal? - Deal. Okay, tonight at eight. - Be there or be square! - Okay. Where are you going so early on a Sunday? Hey, young lady! Take it. It's yours. Liu Zipei! Your aunt's house is massive! You say that every time you come here. Hurry up! - Should I take my shoes off? - Yeah. What's that place your aunty goes to? I think it's called Galway. Galway. I can't seem to find it. Of course you can't. It's too small. It's so far away… When are you going? Christmas. I thought we were going to Japan at Christmas. What's that? - This is what we'll wear in Japan. - What's that smell? It's my sister's. It's really old. - It's gone moldy. - It's a famous brand. - You'll freeze without it. - Yeah, but it'll give me a heatstroke now. Your parents are so nice to you. They know you can't get into college here, and send you abroad. What's so nice about that? My English sucks. I won't be able to communicate with anybody there. So what's your aunt doing there? Frying chips. She managed to buy such a big house by frying chips? Wonder how many chips she needed to fry. Poor thing. You should be in the sea. I feel sorry for us humans. We get eaten by them. Where should I put the fish? - You're leaving? - Yeah. - Help me with that, Liu Zipei? - Okay. Can I do that thing again? - What are you two mumbling about? - What are you doing? I was saying I've never seen anyone keep sharks as pets. Rich people, you know? My aunt thinks sharks bring good fortune. If that were true, I'd get ten sharks. I don't believe that crap. The only thing I trust is myself. I trust you too. Hey! This way! AHWING KEY COPY Come up. Brother Hao! - On your toes next time. - Got it. Hey, Hao. Brother Long! New girlfriend? What are you talking about? Wow, she's a young one. I picked her up on the street. Next time let me tag along. I'll let you tag along next time when I go pick up shit. Are you done packing those? Hurry up! Take a seat. Receipt, please. 30 boxes, right? - I'll tell you when I'm on the other side. - Be careful. Let me know when you are there. Do you need a hand? - Watch out, man. - You look tired. Unlike you, I have to run around. - What do you prefer? - I prefer mature… - What are you talking about? - Nothing… "Mature" what? I meant I like my eggs well done. - Chi wants his eggs well done. - Got it! Hey, Liu Zipei. This is Sister Hua. - Say hello! - Hi, Sister Hua. Meal time! I'm starving! - Have some chicken. - I want that piece! Wait! We have a guest today. Watch your manners! Don't mind them. Eat what you like. Don't be shy. Jay, I don't think there's enough food today. It would have been enough. But Hao has brought a girl with him. No wonder! Where's my cucumber? He ate it before I even had time to wash it. Hao is so greedy! You think that's funny, Four Eyes? You weren't so happy last week, were you? If it weren't for this girl, four phones would've been gone, brother Four Eyes. You should thank her. Sister Hua. It was my fault. Eat this. Don't be mad. Jay, the eggs are so overdone. You said you wanted them well done. - It's so well done. - Super well done. If you don't finish all this, Jay will lose face. Girl, what kind of ID do you have? - I have… - She has a Hong Kong ID, but lives in Shenzhen. - It's very handy. - Are you the girl? Was I asking you? Is she your girl? Not today, but she will be tomorrow. She already is. - How did you know? - She's my god sister! Two weeks ago it was Amy, then Bobo… Wait, what was your name again? - I'm… - Who cares. - We'll just call you sister-in-law. - Sister-in-law! Do you know what business we are in? Have you moved stuff over the border before? Don't worry, Sister Hua. She saved his ass. She's a smart girl. Can't keep your mouth shut? Sister Hua thinks you talk too much. Have some more fish. Pass me a bit will you? You think it's funny? What if I really let you carry the stuff and you get caught at customs? Aren't you afraid? I go through there everyday. I should be fine. You think you'll be okay? That was a long piss. Is your dick not working? If you ever get caught, just say the goods belong to you. Or say they belong to your parents or relatives. Say they are for personal use. If you ever get caught, remember to keep the receipt. Or I'll kill you. I'm joking. You simply won't get paid. - Your ID. - What? Your ID. Liu Zipei. 16 years old. Young and tender. Four Eyes, grab me an iPhone. Yes, sir. - KB, go wait for me in the car. - Yes, got it. Did you get a facelift or something? She's not your girlfriend. Hao has peculiar tastes. - You guys done yet? - Yeah. - How many did you give her? - One iPhone. Give her one more. - Okay. - Thank you, Sister Hua. - Come down when you're done! - Yes. - Are you off? - Yes. - Four Eyes! - Got it. I want you to take this receipt to this address. Go there as soon as you're on the other side. Be careful. Sister Peipei! Did I scare you? Auntie Hong. I told you to speak Cantonese. But we're not in Hong Kong anymore. - I want to have pizza. - Okay. You're here very late today, Peipei. See you around Peipei. Bye! Hello there! Are you alone? What's your name? Idiot. Hello? My boss says the vehicle has to have a refrigerating system. Fuck that! Tell your boss the air conditioner in my car is fine. Did you just call me? Give me the goods. - The receipt. - What? Didn't Chi give you the receipt? Oh, he did. Get on with it! I'd be off work already if it weren't for you. Don't be so late next time! Go! Go! There are three aspects to sex. Knowledge, the technical aspect, and rights. Now I'm going to show you how to use a condom properly. It's very simple. Hold the tip like this. Then safely roll it down like this. Not using a condom properly can be very dangerous. Thanks for giving us a demonstration of what not to do. Does Hao know you're going to study abroad? Of course not! He won't treat me the same if he knows I'm leaving. Men are too practical. But what would you know. As I was saying, this is the restaurant my friend went to. We can eat a whole mountain of sushi. For less than $100! - We must go there. - Do you love him then? Yeah. We have got to eat this! Oh no… We'll put on five kilograms in Japan. Probably more! I'll be going abroad soon. What if… I let you have Hao after I've left. - You're crazy. - What? You want a virgin instead? Jo… What? Are you… Feeling horny? Stop it! I'm going on Instagram to find you a boyfriend. - Stop taking pictures! - You want virgin boys. Hello Auntie. Hi Jo. Hello Uncle. Don't you have classes today? The teacher is sick. Peipei! Aren't you going to say hi to Uncle Zhou? Peipei! Have fun you two! - She's such a difficult teenager. - Don't worry. Peipei! Jo doesn't often come over. I'll leave you some money. Take her out for a nice meal. - Four Eyes, come help me. - Yes. Stay right there. Sister, go and help your brother will you? Go on. What's so funny? Got it all? Just a few more boxes. What do you need? Go get those iPhones, and arrange them by color. Brother Shui. There you are. Don't touch me! Kiss her! Kiss her! - Four Eyes, open the door. - Okay. It tickles. If you want to try it on just say. Help me sister Hua! Cut it out! What's all this noise about? They want to deliver the goods wearing school uniforms. - A student delivery girl just like you? - Yes. Your first delivery to the other side. And you've come up with a great idea. Smart girl. She's starting to look like me when I was younger. Not just a pretty face! Clever girls like Peipei are rare these days. Yes, Sister Hua. With these costumes, you must deliver at least five phones each. Peipei is leading the team today. Okay. Don't you think Hao looked really hot just now? Don't be silly. We're going to the movies. What are you doing? - What? - What're you doing? - I've got something to do. - What? What's that? - Tickets? - Exactly. I've done my research. It'll be snowing on those dates. We can sit in the hot springs and drink sake. - Just don't get drunk. - If I get drunk I can just hug you. Wow, you're so heavy! How did you get the tickets so quickly? - I made some money. - Made money? How? You must have a boyfriend. - No, I've been tutoring some students. - That's highly unlikely. You only scored two points higher than me in math. What are you talking about? Peipei has a boyfriend and didn't tell us. - You've got a boyfriend? - No, I don't. - You can go if you're in a hurry. - What hurry? I thought we were going to the movies? Did you get the tickets? What tickets? - Excuse me, is Brother Yong around? - I think he went that way. - In the restaurant maybe? - Yeah. Over there. Thanks. Good girl! Thank your grandpa! We're going to live in a big house. Give me a hug. - Yeah! - So awesome! See? You're smiling now. Have a chicken drumstick. What's up? On the other side yet? Just a little hiccup. I'll be there soon. What's the matter? Send me your location. The latest iPhone model. What's it selling for today? I'll have someone bring her up. - So? Can you fix it? - Yes. - That'll set you back $1,500. - That's so expensive! This is the latest version and the screen is badly damaged. - Can I replace it for an identical one? - Yes, an original screen. Do you take Hong Kong dollars? - Why don't you just sell this one to me. - No, I can't sell it. - When can you fix it? I'm in a hurry. - Right now. Hold on a sec. Lee! Take her up. See if she'll sell it for $12,000. - Follow him. - Let's go. - Sell the phone to me! Will you sell it? - New iPhone. I told you it's brand new. All you need to do is replace the screen. Offer her a few more dollars then. Hey! Be careful! Can you fix it? If not, I'll take it back. How about $8,000? No. I'm not selling it. I just want to fix it. She doesn't want to sell. Give it back! What are you doing? Can you stop that please? What are you saying? Ten thousand. This is mine. That was quite a scene you made. The whole market was watching. Just don't tell anyone else. Bad boy. Bad girl. - Yong, have you fixed it yet? - Almost. Shall we talk about our own business? You are in charge. This is why I like you! Don't get so close or you'll stress him out. This is the first time you've brought a school girl. - Way to go, man! - Stop talking rubbish. How much do I owe you? Fatty, how much? - How much? - How much? Name your price. How can I charge an old friend? I'm sorry, this is all I have on me. Funny girl. Interesting. Where did you find her? Are you done yet, Yong? Yep. Thanks. What now? You want some tea? - Have some tea! - Bye. You're here. Come on in. Take a seat. - Any trouble finding me? - Not really. - Got the package? - A glass of water will do. I said have you got the package? Yes. Here you go. Here you go. Good. Are you decorating the plate? Let me tell you… Don't let Sister Hua's boys find out next time. Here you go. What do you need all this money for? And what do you need all this money for? Three beef noodles to take away. Got it. Your iced milk tea is ready! - Are my noodles ready yet? It's been ages. - Almost there. - Step on it, Hao! Customers are waiting. - Yes, Sir. One beef noodles! Take this to table one, will you? - Which one is table one? - The one on the left. Coming! - This is for the table on the right. - Okay. - May I help you? - An iced tea. Yes, coming. One Set Meal C. Okay. Anyone else not get their noodles yet? Anyone missing drinks? Try this. - Hi, Hao. - Hi. Careful. It's hot. Like it? What's this? - It's for you. - Nice. What the hell is that? What are those red dots? You drew them on? But I have a new phone now. - I'll take it back then. - I'm kidding. Thanks. - Hao, come and help me. - Coming! Idiot. Come. Shout it out with me. I'm not an idiot like you. It feels great. Look, there's a shooting star! - It's just a plane. - Shut up and use your imagination. I thought you only believed in yourself. Yeah, I do. I only trust myself. Because whatever happens, you've only got yourself in the end. Why did you bring me up here? I come here when I want to get away from it all. What do you think? Happy? A handsome guy taking you out for a drive. Actually this is the first time… I bring someone here. I'll let you enjoy yourself then. I'm going back. Where are you going in such a hurry? Ow, that's itchy. - Too many mosquitos. - I'm going. How will you get back? Taxi? Stop acting tough. Give me a hand. Are you going to drive across? Hey, catch that. Put it on, quickly! You can't swim, right? - Does it work? - Are you doubting me? I was driving boats before you were born. Let me help you. Sit down. Careful. What's going on? Brother, this boat is a piece of shit. We're stuck here. I'm in some fucking cave. Find it yourself. I'm throwing you to the sharks when you get here. Where are you, shark? Someone wants to feed you. I think Hao is cheating on me. How many times have you said that this week? This time it's for real. When was the last time you saw us together? Two weeks ago! He used to say goodnight to me every night. He didn't even call me last night. He wasn't like this before. He's probably just busy. Someone told me yesterday that he took a girl up to Kowloon Peak with him. Do you think she's from our school? How would I know? - You've put on BB cream, have you? - Just like you taught me. Like I taught you? Vanity queen! Stop worrying. You're going to Ireland anyway. Not anymore. Yesterday my dad told me, he never had any intention of sending me abroad. He said girls don't need to go. They can stay in Hong Kong and marry. It's always like this. My brother gets it all. I'm counting on you. You guys are finished! Three hundred each. Cough up! I'm so in luck right now! I'll have to pay you with my underpants next. See? Peipei is my lucky charm. - Things've changed since Peipei got here. - Things are different, boys! You bet. I'm officially adopting her from now on. - For you from your Godmother. - Thanks Godmother! Good girl. I had a terrible hand. But Peipei got me all the good pieces. Yes? IPhone 6, iPhone 6. It's driving me crazy. I know you're out of stock. But for such a big delivery… I need to find someone I can really trust. Okay, okay! I'll let you know when I get more in. Talk later. They need another batch. But today's delivery… It's not as easy as delivering a phone, Hong. It's all the same. - True. We just need someone we trust. - Sure. My dear goddaughter. I need a special delivery worth several thousand done. Let's say it's a gift from your Godmother. Yeah, sure! - Sister Hua, why can't I go? - None of your business. Sister Peipei. Don't scare my goddaughter, Chi! It looks so real! This is a good one. Take a look at that Jay. Yesterday that loser got stuck at the crossing with the goods. Shenzhen keeps pushing me for the next delivery. Peipei, will you make the delivery for me? No… How can I ask a girl to go through customs with a gun. Sister Hua, let me find you someone smart to deliver it. Can't trust outsiders. Better to use our own people. Yeah. Better to use your own people. Peipei, it's not something Hua'd ask anyone to do lightly. Some people want to do it so bad. Come on, take this for me. Wow! This is some gun, Sister Hua. Sure you don't want me to take it? I'm smarter than her, right, Chi? She wouldn't ask an idiot like you. - What did you say? - You're an idiot. - I'll blow your head off. - Go ahead. - I'm waiting. - Oh, I'm so scared! - That's enough. Calm down! - We're just fooling around. I'm just kidding. - Chi, sit down. Let's play. - You're always winding people up. Come on! Luck's on my side tonight. Tighten your belt or your pants will fall down. Losing to Sister Hua is an honor. Who's turn is it? My turn? - Sister Hua, I'm going to the washroom. - Okay. Come over here. What's the matter? Let go of me! Use your brain! Those are guns. You could go to jail for that. If you can do it, why can't I? Stay away from it. Who are you to tell me what to do? You have no idea what kind of person Sister Hua is. Are you scared? What are you talking about? You're scared I'll tell her you're stealing her business. You think they see you as one of them? - You think you're the boss? - I brought you here. You're nothing but a noodle seller! Fuck this! Hola! Como estás? Sit. I've been reading your fortune. If we go to Spain together, our fate will change. You don't even know where Spain is. It's in the Northwestern Hemisphere. Why can't you just wish me happiness? I've been thinking. All I want… is for us both to lead a happy life. Whatever other daughters have, I want my daughter to have. Cut it out. What's going on? What do you want? Are you the girl from that day? Are you the girl who went up the mountain with Hao? Answer me! I can explain everything. Do you really think Hao took you up the mountain because he likes you? I'm his girlfriend! Who do you think you are? I took you out to have fun! I took you to the yacht party! Who do you think you are? What are you looking at? How many times did you do it? How many times did he get on you? How many times did you lie to me? You all lied to me! My dad lied to me. My brother took everything from me. But you can't lie to me, Peipei! - I was doing this for our Japan trip. - Not you! You can't lie to me. Japan. You're a whore just like your mom! What did you say? Say that again! Stop fighting! Stop! Stop it! Peipei! Stop it! Out of my way! Get up. Give me my money back, please! - Give me my money. - Get lost! What are you doing? - Peipei! - Don't push me. - I won't hit a young girl. - Peipei, forget about the money. - Peipei! - Get lost! We can always earn more money. I don't need the money. Are you all right? Go away! The lot of you! HAO I want you to make a delivery for me. Aren't you afraid Sister Hua will find out? What's the matter with you? - Nothing. - You're so clumsy. Let me help you. Come on. Put that down. Pull up your shirt. I won't look. Is it okay there? It tickles. Just hold on. I'm thinking… If this works out well, I want to rent my own warehouse. If I do, would you deliver for me? I'm very expensive. Can you afford me? You're worth it whatever the cost. Is that okay? Is it too tight? I want to take the rest. Where else can we attach them? Hold on. How come you like sharks so much? How come you like snow so much? Because I want to know what it feels like to be cold. Why not just… put your head in the fridge? How do you know I haven't tried that? You! Stop! Step over here for inspection, please. Sister Hua, have some tea. Don't mind if I do. Wow, Fatty. This tea smells great. Far better than the tea last year. - Sister Hua, about this delivery… - Fatty! This tea is really good. I'm not kidding. If only I knew you were coming today I'd have prepared an even better brew. I've never liked your shenanigans. Let me explain. I had no idea what this kid was doing behind your back. I'd never have given him the phones. Stop pretending! You get $50 extra for every phone! You think I don't know that? I'll split the profit with you. Thanks for being so cooperative. Watch the goods! Let me go! Stand still. Chi. She's a young lady. Don't be so rough. Be gentle. You should learn from Hao. Hao, show him how it's done. She's talking to you. She's talking to you. Come on! Kids these days are so busy being love birds. They think they're the only ones in this world. Look at you. All disheveled. The big fish eat the little fish. Remember. Never trust a man. I'm going to give you one more chance. One last chance. Don't waste my time. Batu, remove the phones from her. Stop. I've got this. I told you. I'll be gentle. Don't move! Police! Freeze! Stay where you are! Come here! How's Peipei doing? She was granted bail. That's good to hear. She's my only concern. You've been through so much. It hasn't been easy. Come on. Why couldn't we take the gondola? That's Hong Kong for you.
