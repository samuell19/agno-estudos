First Pavilion Who's there? - Professor Foss, will you please open the door. Professor? - May I help you? I'm sorry about the time, but it's very important. We're doctors. We need to speak to you. - Please ... I'm listening. I'm Dr. Baxter, Resident Ministry of War clinic. There's been a very serious accident with the pilot test of new missile. We've just come from surgery. - I don't know what I could do to help. I'm not a medical doctor. Yes, but this case has a connection with the research you are doing. I read your article in a scientific journal. That which you have called a "a theoretical possibility" has become fact, a concrete fact. What? The dynamic growth of cells? Yes, under the influence of cosmic radiation. In this case - the growth of cancer cells. This is incredible! Alright! Give me a moment. Where are we going? This isn't the way to the 4th quarter. What is the meaning of this? Can you answer my question? We know where we are going. You'll soon be where you need to be. Enough, gentlemen! I'm asking you to stop the car! Do not be a baby! - So this is a kidnapping, right? I warn you, it will end badly! Shut the hell up, college man! I do not know how to apologize to you, Professor. Perhaps a glass of cognac? - No, thank you. My people will be taken care of. But first, I must explain to you ... ... Why I had to resort to such a tasteless falsehood to entice you to us. Mr. Director, please! Herr Professor is here? I thought you were in Australia! - Oh, my dear, such a bad climate there... Well, gentlemen, I'll leave you alone. My role here is complete. Now the Director himself will introduce you to our secret. Best of luck! Which one of you dumb brutes dared to raise his voice in the car? I ask, who shouted at Professor Foss? He did. Yes, Mr. President, but I wasn't serious... Open the drawer. Hand. Mr. President ... Kick it. Kick it! And now you. Morons. ... In a couple of weeks we can begin the new experiments. Excuse me, professor, but I do not understand how important it all can be in practice? My dear, first I'll show you these practical results. What you see is a tiny representation of our world. Each model is reduced ten-fold compared to the original. Increasingly restless voices discuss the overpopulation of the Earth, diminishing food supplies, natural resources, space... One day, thinking about it, I realized that if each human could be reduced in size, say, 1/10 ... ... Everything that one needs would automatically have increased 10 times. You might think that this is some criminal, chelovekoubiystvennaya idea ... No, no, my idea is humanistic. In shrinking all humanity--- The world would have many times the resources to offer. I pondered various means to accomplish this goal. About methods of cross-breeding a new dwarf human race... The way we do with dogs. But I was intimidated by the prospect of decades of experimentation. Finally, I realized the solution! And now, my dear, look inside. This is the first experimental hall. Well, what do you think? But you ... Well, three-quarters of an hour of sleep. This corresponds to 8 hours. We shall awaken them. Professor! You were not expecting that? They're alive? Alive? Of course they're alive. Thank you, I will not eat. As you wish. But I think you are being petty. I will not accept any of your offers, alright? I only want to know if it was an illusion or a hallucination! The professor showed me these dolls, rising from bed, then began to tell me some nonsense ... We can discuss it with the Director ... - Director! What is this comedy? Professor Franton is the Director of our Center. I'll ask him to show you the pavilion again... ...If you wish. Now please enjoy! - If you insist, I will eat! Director, Professor Foss. Please, sir ... - Oh, these incredulous young men... But Professor ... - Don't speak. Come here, Doubting Thomas ... We will repeat the entire session from the beginning. I hate to wake them at this hour. But if I must... And now, look, my dear, look. Look---and believe. Let's see what it says, this---as you put it---doll. You call this orderly? ... Well, are these dolls alive? Yes Professor, but ... Okay, okay, look. What have we here? It is not in the spirit of the military... ...Pastor Levitsky. Do not forget that I allowed your beard as an exception. A kindness. Appreciate it. They can not see us? Neither see nor hear. This glass reflects light rays and sound waves. They think that the windows are covered, as these are. Remember my words---One day you will miss this life. May I see them more closely? - Indeed you can. Here, Look through this. And you, Mrs. Wheeler, late again today. Unfortunately, I saw it. Well, how do we proceed? Maybe eliminate the privilege of a separate bedroom? This idiot and his perverted power. Unfortunately, I can not yet replace him. By the way, don't you know him, my dear? The same lobby. Komendant David Holl. My assistant at the University. Do you remember? Think ... That is Holl? Professor, this is incredible! Excuse me, but ... I'll forgive you, my dear. I know you have many questions. I will answer them all. This is the fourth. Everything is going according to plan, the Director advises. Foss is with him now. Simple, is it not? - Have they agreed to this? You kidnapped them, like me! Ah, my dear. Science requires sacrifice. However, we did not. And besides ... ...They are not aware of their condition. Impossible! - Not at all. One moment. I told you that the method is based on the effects of radiation SF-5 on the human body. I developed a unique method of execution. See, an innocent, ordinary shower. But look here, under the ceiling. These emitters. Who would have noticed them... I thought they came here voluntarily? - The procedure is as follows ... My assistant David Holl goes to the elected with a fictitious agenda in military training. The recruit is brought here, where we play the comedy with the award of a special department of direction. Speak to him a few phrases regarding duty to his country, military secrets, honor, etc. The President does it brilliantly! Holl then conducts the guinea pig to the shower. Radiation acts during the shower and the person is miniaturized. Evenly ... Observe! The shower unit shrinks quickly. When the person emerges... ...he has unknowingly undergone a ten-fold reduction. Now ... I take out the entire unit from the wall and insert it into the model hall. There waiting for him is Holl, also miniaturized. Without these comedies, of course. The recruit is given his uniform. During night training they go to the aerodome, get on the plane and begin to fly! We're flying! Sometimes I even make the motor noise! And these organic changes do not cause mental changes? No. It seems not. Maybe they're a little disorientated. We can write it off as the usual disorientation civilians feel in the first weeks of life in the barracks. But one moment. The miniaturized can become full-sized again? Certainly. I have invented a method of complete reversal. The same SF-5 radiation, but regulated differently. But what does Komendant Holl say? What are his impressions? Holl? Ask him yourself. Holl, attention! Please! Holl, come out! Professor! - Well, here he is, speak to him! Good day, Holly! How do you feel? Wonderful, Professor! Excellent! You do not have any ill health in this state? - On the contrary! For me it is better. I have always been overweight ... At least his wit is not affected. I must have been a terrible bore, Professor! Director, it's the monster! - Holl, I'm ashamed. The monster's here again! Alright, I'll save you! Go away, "giant cat"! Hideous monster! - Yes, yes. You promised to get rid of it! - Okay, okay. We need to talk seriously, Professor! Send Holly back. Are you in command, now? The director has no secrets from me! Yes, you can talk. - Okay, I'll talk. I have to say it bluntly. Wake up, Professor! You're under the influence of criminals. Yes, common criminals! This is all being done for nefarious purposes, don't you see? What are you saying? They're philanthropists! They've spent fortunes on research that will save humanity! Philanthropists? So why I was kidnapped? I did not agree to any of this! But you have to help me. We need to work together on this experiment. The ten-fold decrease is only a half measure. We must develop a thousand-fold reduction method, a million-fold! Professor, this is nonsense! Wake up, this is nonsense! Mr. President, I have to report ... Dear Professor Foss! Allow me to give you a full explanation! Think hard. I assure you, it's not very pleasant. Remember, I'm warning you one last time. If you refuse me, I will induce the radiation. Of course, you will be confined to the hall indefinitely. Stop! I agree. On the condition that I will only work with the professor. And not in front of the hall. Agreed. Am I your assistant or accomplice? Professor, you must tell me everything. I need to understand the entire process or how can I help you? They would not let me. They will not know, I promise you. It is very simple. Just use the formula SF-5 plus the factor 74. Ah, so. Yes, it's simple. Do not stop me! This is the right thing, don't you understand? You know it is. No, no! - Can't you understand? You must! This is a heinous crime, they're abusing your knowledge! For the sake of violence over the world! They want to destroy humanity! Professor! Stand back! You can not! I can not be interrupted! Hold it! Help me! You can not! No, no! Do not shoot! Do not turn off light! Who's there? - Professor Foss, will you please open the door.
