Diablos! Falcon Main, this is Bravo Team. Falcon Main, this is Bravo Team. Do you copy? Storm incoming. Zero visibility. Request immediate support. Falcon Main, something's in here with us. Send immediate support. Falcon Main, this is Bravo Team. Send immediate support. Ma'am. Ma'am. - Marshall. - Link found something half a klick ahead. - Bravo Team? - Think so. Axe. - With Steeler. Man the 50. - Yes, boss. All right, ladies. Saddle up. She's a woman, but she still manages to make that sound like an insult. Get used to it. Captain. - You see those markers? - Yeah, I see them. Do you have any idea what they are? Sergeant Davis, I'm a Ranger, not an archeologist. Copy that. - Axe! - What? - What are you listening to? - George Jones. Who the hell's that? You're a philistine, Steeler. Yes. Yes, I am. Damn, Marshall. You got hella reflexes. Fifteenth casualty today. - Killing them. - Take no prisoners, Davis. - Link, what'd you find? - It's definitely Bravo Team. But the tracks end here. - What were Bravo Team traveling in? - Up-armored Humvee and a M-ATV. That's ten tons of armored vehicle. They don't just disappear. Boss, we've got something. Incoming. On your 12. - Where did that come from? - Came out of nowhere. Bravo Team reported a storm in their last transmission. - Hostiles using it for cover? - An ambush. Like in Helmand? Let's not find out. REDCON-1. If there are hostiles hiding behind that storm, things might get kinetic. Copy that. Marshall, what are you doing, bro? In case I get my head blown off, they can still tell who I am. Hardcore shit, cabr√≥n. Damn! Goddamn, that shit's close. Link, you ever seen lightning like this before? No. Never. But I feel pretty secure here in this big steel box, holding my metal gun. Dash, on your 12! Look at those markers! What the hell is that? - Watch out! - Damn it! Brace yourselves! Shit! Where the hell are we? And what happened to the storm? What the hell just happened? - Hey! - Guys! You okay? - I'll survive. - Did we just get hit by lightning? - Steeler, you good? - Never better. Where did all this sand come from? This isn't right, none of it. What the hell is that? I don't see any structures or mountains marked on this map. According to this, the nearest sand dune is 20 klicks away. - How's that possible? - Where the hell are we? - How did we get so far from the road? - I don't know. Axe, get on one of those dunes - and set up an observation point. - Yes, boss. - Steeler! - DPV will run. She's had worse. - Marshall? - GPS is fried, boss. Radio and sat. All I get is static. Even the compass is screwed up. Must have been the lightning. Well, what do you wanna do? Go analog. Navigate by the sun. Make it back to base. We hoof it if we have to. Boss, that's a long hike. Yeah, well, we keep going till we get comms. Then AWACS will call in support. They'll send helos, maybe armor. - Nice. - Back in business. - Boss. - Send it. There's something you got to see. Up-armored DPV and a M-ATV. It's Bravo Team. V-formation. Move out. What do we do about them? When we get comms, we'll call in recovery assets to retrieve the bodies. - What happened to them? - Flamethrowers. I don't think so. Never seen a flamethrower do this to a man. - Not even napalm burns that hot. - Ma'am? It's glass. Glass? When sand melts, it turns to glass. How do you melt sand? I don't know. This shit is officially above my pay grade. Looks like they made a stand. - Let off a lot of rounds. - They didn't hit anything. There's no bodies. Maybe they took the bodies with them? - I've seen that before. - Yeah. - Well, that's just the thing. - What do you see, Link? Nothing. No tracks anywhere. Whoever did this, they didn't leave a mark. We need to get moving. Move out! Dark Star to Falcon. Dark Star to Falcon, over. Damn it. Lightning really messed up the electronics, huh? Not just electronics. - What do you mean? - This isn't right. Nothing about this is right. That lightning, it did something to us. Captain knows what she's doing, all right? They say that in the army The pay is mighty fine They say that in the army The pay is mighty fine They give a hundred dollars And take back 99 They give a hundred dollars And take back 99 Oh, how I wanna go But they won't let me go Home They say that in the army The shoes are mighty fine You ask for size 11 They give you size nine You ask for size 11 They give you a size nine Oh, Lord, I wanna go But they won't let me go Home Jesus. - It has to be a dinosaur, right? - Saw a dinosaur in a museum one time. It wasn't that big. Hostile, 12 o'clock, 300 meters! Cease fire! Cease fire! - What's going on? - It's just chalk. Chief? Diablos. On our 6! What the hell is that? Link, back in the vehicle. Dash, Steeler, move, move, move! Fire! It's gaining on us! You're caught. - Come on, get out of here! - No way! - One... - Holy... ...two, three! Fire! Give me your hand. Come on! Dash! Come on! I'm trying! Steeler! - Got it, got it, got it! - Marshall, get in! Let's go, big boy! Give me your hand! Get inside! Link, get the RPG! Oh, my God. Fall back! Fall back! Run for cover! Captain. Come on! Come on, boss! I got it, I got it! Move, move! Reloading! What was that thing? What is that? I told you. I told you. That light, it took us somewhere. We need to get back. We need to get back home. - Stow it, Sergeant Davis. - Oh, my God. We're gonna die here. Shut that shit up right now, soldier. That's an order. - You see what it did to Steeler and Axe? - Dash, hey. I got three. You? - What? - Three mags left. What does it matter? Did you see that? It matters because we're soldiers. And this is what we do. We fight. - Am I right? - Rangers lead the way. - You with me? - Always, boss. You're all crazy. You know, I don't care what the hell that thing is. We do what we do best. We fight and we survive. No matter what the odds. You got it? - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. You got it? Loud and clear, ma'am. Now, I got three left. What about you? Med pack! - CPR, Marshall. - On it. - It's too late. - Bullshit! Don't die on me, Ranger. Come on. - Lack of pulse. - Unacceptable. Try it again. - I'm sorry. - Shit! There's more of them! Come on! We have to go! They're everywhere! I'm sorry. Master sergeant! - Link! - All right, on me! Let's move out! Fall back, fall back! Dash! Come on! Keep moving! Marshall! Go, go, go! No! Link. Dash. Dash. Dash. Come on. - You're alive. - Link. What is it? What is it? Pain in my chest! I can't feel my arm. Some sort of poison. You just gotta work through it. Come on. Let's move. Come on. All right. Oh, God. Oh, no. Captain. All right, it's just a little further. Let's go. I can't move. Okay, let me see. Let me see what it is. Go! Oh, my God! God, Link! No! You gotta go! Link! Damn you. Damn you! But I'm coming home. Nerscylla. - Nerscylla! - Get off me. Nice life you've... See how you like it. Cheers. Oh, you spiteful little bastard. Hey. How about that? Yeah. You don't like that, huh? Not so funny now, huh? I'll kill you. Come on! Push! Push! Here. I'm not your enemy. Wait, wait. Wait. One second. Look. Look. Here. Food. Food. Here. Take it. Here, give it to me. Look, look. So good. It's good, right? Slow down. Okay, it's good. It's chocolate. - Chocolate. - Chocolate. Yeah, chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate. - Choco... - Chocolate! - Chocolate! - I don't have any more. No, no more, no more, no more. Look, look. Nothing. I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Thank you so much. Oh, my God. Thank you. Hey. Wait! Where are you going? Wait! Me and you go out there? Yes. That lightning, I think that's what brought me here. I need to go there. I need to get home. That thing is still out there. - Diablos. - Diablos. Hey, over there... I have weapons. Diablos... What? Ni trovi Nerscylla. - What? - Nerscylla. No. We don't need to go back in there. We need to go out there. Diablos. Diablos. Diablos. Nerscylla. Diablo... We poison it. Smart. To kill a monster, you need a monster. But how are we gonna get one of those things? What? They say that in the army The coffee's mighty fine It looks like muddy water And tastes like turpentine Oh, Lord, I wanna go But they don't let me go Home They say that in the army The men are mighty fine To me they look like hunchbacks And sound like Frankenstein Oh, Lord, I wanna go But they won't let me go Home Come on! Yes! Got it! Next time, you're bait! "Ranger." That's me. Ranger. Yeah. Yeah. Hunter. Hunter. Ranger. - Yeah. Yes. - Hunter? Velcro. Velcro. Yeah. Velcro. Velcro. Okay. All right, all right. That's enough. That's enough. Oh, man. Really trying to get in here, huh? Is that your family? Are you gonna see them? Are you gonna go home? Home? I'm sorry. Rathalos. Let's do this. Never mind. Let's go. Ready! Yeah! What is that? You gotta tell me about that. You can't just do that to somebody. Any second now. Stop! Bait! Shit! Come on! Watch over him! You're welcome. Apceros. Apceros. - Apceros. - Yeah. Okay. Okay. They eat grass. Water. Water. Bait. Bait? You're funny. Know what I'm gonna do next time you're dying in the desert? Nothing. That smells good. - Catch Cephalos. - I'll eat anything at this point. Home. Yeah. My way home. I hope. Chocolate. Chocolate. So good. What's that? All right. Chocolate. No, no, no. - Chocolate. - Not chocolate. - What's going on? - Rathalos. You said that before. What the hell is a Rathalos? Thank you. Thank you. Don't thank me yet. Enjoying the show? This one must have come from the sky. What? What is that? Palico. My friend tells me I misjudged you. I may even owe you an apology. Just don't hold your breath. Why did you put me in chains? What are you so afraid of? Your world... and what it could do to mine. You aren't the first to cross over from your world. There were others. Long time ago. That's how you speak my language? - I made a study of it. - What happened to me? How did I get here? I believe that the answers we both seek lie here. At the peak of that mountain lies the Sky Tower. Remnants of an ancient civilization. Very advanced. Very dangerous. It is said that the Ancients knew how to travel between both worlds. I believe that is the purpose of the Sky Tower. That is what brought you here. What happened to this ancient civilization? They destroyed themselves. Their technology turned on them. You think my world had something to do with it. I suspect. But an open gateway between our two worlds was catastrophic once. I intend to make sure that doesn't happen again. We were on our way to investigate the Sky Tower when we strayed into the Diablos. That's where I lost my friend here. Tending to the wounded and repairing the ship was our first priority. But now we resume our mission. The Ancients would guard their technology with the most fearsome of creatures, a Rathalos. Almost impossible to kill. Their only weakness is just before they breathe fire. You help us with the battle ahead, perhaps we can help you get home. What's the matter? You don't have cats in your world? Hey! You been drinking from my mug again? We leave at dawn. And don't keep me waiting. I hate waiting. So? You ready? We got a hard climb ahead of us. Come on! We believe that the lava powers the machinery within the tower. It's controlling the storm. Exactly. It's creating a gateway to your world, but it looks unstable. Let's go. It's glass. Estas bone Rathalos. Rathalos. Prepare yourself. Remember, they're weak just before they breathe fire. Hey, ugly! It's okay! It's okay. You're safe now! Get the medic! Captain Artemis? Let's get her inside! Up! Let's go! Let's go! Captain, we've been searching for you. What the hell is she wearing? Falcon Main, this is Red Wolf. We've made contact with Dark Star. We have a lone survivor. I say again, a lone survivor. Ground forces are securing the area. Copy that, Red Wolf. Captain. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Captain? Captain Artemis? Where are the rest of your men? - My men? - Yes. Where are the rest of Alpha Team? Copy that. We're under attack! Aim for the belly! A Rathalos. Load! Fire! No! No! No! It's coming right for us! Evade! We're on Channel 5. Interference is... My God. Come on! I got you. My friend. Thought you might need a little help. Yeah, I... still don't understand you, man. Oh, yeah. Friends. Yeah, thank you. Min misa chocolate? I don't have any more chocolate. Think fast. - You're here. - We came to help. We can't have monsters from my world attacking yours. It's starting again. We don't have much time. There's going to be another attack. We have to get back. We have to shut the Sky Tower down. - Let's try to live through this first. - Copy that.
