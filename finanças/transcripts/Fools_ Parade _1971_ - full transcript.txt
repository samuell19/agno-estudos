(CLUNKING) Peas, Mattie, Peas. No store is any good without green peas. Captain, how do you feel about apple sauce? That tall man, that one with the white hair and the glass eye, that's Mattie Appleyard. He killed two or three men. - Yeah, I heard them talking about him in town this morning. A whole land withering on the vine, bread lines as long as freight trains. And a man that's killed maybe three men, riding out with all that money. (DOG BARKS) Now then, each one of ya has got himself a brand new state-free suit. And a state-free pair of shoes If you reach in your right-hand pocket, you will find yourself a brand new five-dollar bill. In your left-hand pocket, you'll find 7 cents car fare. Besides them greatest state-free gifts... ...each man has been given a state-free B&O ticket in his hip pocket. Prisoner release papers is in your coat pocket, they're in order. Westbound to Parkersburg will come along in 17 minutes. Pull out of this depot in 23 minutes. When it leaves, you'll be on it. Mattie they tell me up at the state prison that you've got a certified cheque in your pocket. They tell me it's for better than $25,000. - That's right, captain. What does a man have to do in Glory Prison to get a whole lot of money like that? 40 years hard work, captain. - What are you sweating for, Cottrill? You don't call this hot weather, do you, Cottrill? Not if you say it ain't, captain. Where are you from, boy? Where d'you think you are from, boy? Captain, I was born right here in Glory. You wasn't born, boy. You was found. You was found in a pasteboard box underneath a theatre seat. Ain't that right, boy? Captain, if I was found in Glory, then I must have been born in Glory. Why don't you go on home, then? - Captain, Johnny will be on that train when she pulls out. I am not talking to you, Appleyard. (TRAIN TOOTS) Runnin' early! # Shall we gather # At the river? # The beautiful, the beauti... # Still got time to make a run for it if you want to, boy. Captain, this ticket says Stonecoal, West Virginia. I ain't never been there in my life. Glory's my home. - Why don't you go on home, then? Go on, boy. Start running. Why can't I stay in Glory? They just don't want ex-convicts filling up the town, Johnny, you see. When a man finishes pulling time in Glory prison, the only home he's got is what state writes on his coast ticket. - That's a rule, boy. Just the same as there's rules in the Good Book. Just like the rule you broke that got you sent to Glory Prison. They were wrong. I never did that. Trying to pull that young girl's clothes off. That sweet fragile young thing, that adorable child. He pulled his time, captain, why don't you leave him alone? Shut your mouth, old man, I'm talking to the boy! I could've saved you. If I had you in my Sunday School, me and Jesus could've saved your pitiful soul! But it's too late now, boy! The Devil's got ya! (TRAIN TOOTS) And the Devil's a tough man to get shot of. Aboard! (DOG BARKS) We've been together for a long time now, Joey. I'm sorry we won't be seeing each other no more. You'll find another friend. (DOG WHIMPERS) I'll see you before tomorrow's sunrise, boy. Johnny. What did he say to you? - He said he'd see me before tomorrow's sunrise. What did he mean, Mattie? It sure feels good, don't it? Being on a train again. Yes, sir. It sure feels good. We're moving now. We're leaving this place. (DOG BARKS) (TRAIN'S WHISTLE BLOWS) (HORN BEEPS) Are they on it? - Indeed they are, Mr Grindstaff. Everything all set? - Like a diamond. That's the amount we agreed on, plus a little something extra for you. Thank you. Come in real handy for our missionary fund and vacation Bible school. You know why I like you? Cos you are deaf. You have got just enough sense to be blind, too. What the hell?! Listen, if you three fellas are planning on jumping train somewhere, I just want you to know that's your business. Who said anything about us jumping train? Nobody. I'm just telling you that if you do, it's none of my business. I mean, I just go back and forth to Parkersburg every day. I don't care. I don't care if you jump or not. Where did he come by that idea, that we are aiming to jump train? - I don't know. It almost felt as though he was asking us to. I'm gonna get me some good, clean free air. Lee, why don't you leave your book here? Nobody will bother it. - I can't do that. Nobody's gonna steal your grocery list. It's not a grocery list, it's ivantory. Ivantory's the most important thing a businessman has on him. (SIGHS) What does Tighe say, Mattie? Tighe? Tighe has to tell me what he sees in his own good time. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) The name's Roy K Sizemore. Out of Pittsburgh. Lee Cottrill. Out of prison. Well, now, something to celebrate, huh, brother Lee? (LAUGHS) This oughta taste right good to you after... How long you say you been in? 16 years. I'm my way down to Stonecoal to open up a... store. It's been a long time. - (LAUGHS) Is Stonecoal your home? It's my home and that's where I'm gonna open up a store with my two friends in there. All they've ever had is a company store and that's no real store at all. Ours is gonna to be a general store. What is it, Mattie? What's wrong? - It'll be alright. Is it something bad? - It'll be alright, I say. But you mustn't go back there tonight. Did Tighe see me going back? - Tighe saw you jumping this train and running back to Glory tonight. And leading us all to our doom. I won't, Mattie, I promise. - I believe you. But there's something in the air, Johnny. See that grey-haired fella back there? That's Mattie Appleyard. He did a 40-year rap for two murders. He worked all them years in the prison mine, saved every penny he earned. We're gonna be partners. The sign over the store is gonna to read... (HARMONICA PLAYS) I'd sure hate to be broke and homeless like them poor souls. But you ain't. Your partner, he's rich. How much money did you say he's saved? I didn't, I just said enough to start a store. Now, shucks, brother Lee! (LAUGHS) I wanna meet this great benefactor of yours. Come on, take me in there and introduce me to him. Mattie, this is Roy Sizemore. Roy K Sizemore, Mr Appleyard, and it certainly is a great pleasure to meet you, sir. Yes indeed, a real pleasure. - This is Johnny, Mr Sizemore. Hello, son. - Would you have a seat? Don't mind if I do, Mr Appleyard. What kind of business are you in, Mr Sizemore? Mine supplies. I work the southern district out of Pittsburgh for Vans Pearson Consolidated, Milwaukee. Oh. Hard prospects, times being what they are. Dismal, Mr Appleyard. Just... dismal. What, with the land swarming with radicals and unemployed trash and then there's the criminal element that's been... No offence meant, boys. - We understand, Mr Sizemore. Still, with that sample case of yours, there must be some business on the road. Sample case? Oh. Hell, that's no sample case. That's just an order I'm delivering personal. But you don't want to hear about me and my little dull routine. Mr Appleyard, what I wanna hear is your tale. Because I am by way of being a student of life and a philosopher and when I look at you boys, I tell myself that there but for His grace, go I. Well, it wasn't his Grace that sent us to Glory prison, Mr Sizemore, it was his Honour. (LAUGHS) Yeah. Mr Appleyard. My name's Enoch Purdy. I'm a retired engineer. I live down the river. I ride on the train for nothing and I sell greens just for a pastime. They were talking and whispering about you all over town, that you're carrying a cheque for more than $25,000. I've never even seen a payroll cheque for that much money. Er... could I just see that cheque? Sure. Sure. Here, you can feel it if you like. Mattie, are you sure? - It's alright, Lee. I trust Mr Purdy to hold it more than I trust some to see it. I sure do thank you. My pleasure, Mr Purdy. Whoops. (SNIFFS) What sort of mine supplies do you handle, Mr Sizemore? You know, regular line. Such as what, Mr Sizemore? Hell, you were a miner. Pumps, saws, carbines, drill shanks, permissibles, you know, the regular thing. What are permissibles, Mr Sizemore? (LAUGHS) Why, Mr Appleyard, you do sound like a greenhorn. Well, it's been a long time. A fellow forgets a lot in 40 years. You know, Mattie, dynamite. Oh, dynamite! You know how words and names have a way of failing me. Dynamite. I understand you're on your way to make the delivery, Mr Sizemore? Yes, we, er... - I'm gonna go outside for a while, Mattie. Johnny...! - I'll be back. Mr Sizemore, I don't... Is there something dangerous in that suitcase? No, no, of course not. Like explosives maybe? Mr Appleyard, you've got better sense than that. Why, if they was to get wind of a man carrying dynamite on a common carrier, it'd be a $1,000 fine and a year in jail. Why don't you make a jump for it, boy? What? - I'm trying to talk some sense into you, is what. Get away from them other two. - What do you mean you get away? They're my friends. One's a murderer, the other's a bank robber. Get away from them now. I'll help you. I'm not going! - You've got your whole life ahead of you, boy. For all you know, the other two may be dead by morning and you too if you don't get away from them. Dead? Why should they be dead? What are you bothering me for? You're just a kid and I can't stand to see you get hurt. Come on, I'll help ya. Take your hands of him! What did he mean, Mattie? He said we might be dead by tomorrow morning. There is no sense to it and no reason. (HUMS "Shall we Gather by the River?") Has he got everything straight? Me and Junior here is a team. If I've got it straight, he's got it straight. Do you, boy? I don't expect an impudent answer. I'll do fine. I always do. Steve, he knows me good. Well, I don't know you good. I don't think much of what you're wearing. You stick out like a brakeman's flag. I gotta get to Wheeling by midnight. I got a job singing on the radio. I'm not paying you for the goddamn radio. You know I ain't mucked up the job in 20 years. I know, Steve, you're a good boy. - Well, then why don't you lay off of Junior? You got my word he's cool. He's been on nine jobs with me. Singing on the radio? Smoke Hole. Smoke Hole bourbon. Come on, now! I want you to tell me all the facts behind your little misunderstanding with the law. What's it feel like to really kill a man, huh? Sizemore, I've just heard about enough from you. You reckon I envy you, don't you, on account of that cheque. Well, whose pocket you reckon that money come out of, huh? Huh? Me! The tax payer, that's who! So when you try and cash it, just remember, that it is a gift from Roy K Sizemore and a few other honest men like him. What does he mean, Mattie, trying to cash it? You won't have any trouble cashing it, will you? No. He's drunk Lee, he's just drunk. Could I see the cheque, Mattie? Look at this. "Cashable only by payee in person at bank of issuance." We have to go back to Glory. (THUNDER BOOMS) What the hell is that? - Hm? That? Ladies' bathing cap. Keeps cracked ice in it. What for? - Likes to suck on it. Reckons it keeps his mouth from getting dry on the job. You trying to kid me, Steve? Don't your mouth ever get dry on the job? You trying to kid me? - Well, hell, don't it? I thought you said he didn't get nervous. He ain't. He handles that Winchester like a steel guitar. Which you're gonna find out, Steve. (THUNDER BOOMS) You sure as hell are. It'll be alright. - But you said we'd cash it in Stonecoal, Mattie. You said it'd be alright. - I know I did, Johnny, but I was wrong. There's one place on this earth that that cheque is any good and that's that the bank in Glory. Why didn't you see, Mattie? Why didn't Tighe see? I don't know. I don't know but I didn't and that's all there is to it. I have to go back to Glory. - Well, I don't like it. I don't, either. - I thought we were getting closer to having a store and we are only getting further away. (BRAKES SCREECH) Get off my train. Get off my train! - Why? Why do you want us off your train? There's no time to talk. Just get off and run for your lives. Please. I don't want to hurt you. - Hurt us? You don't want to hurt us? What's that gun for if not to shoot us? Oh, my God. I was desperate when I took their money to do this. My wife is sick. Can you understand that? There's a mortgage. Here's the money they paid me to work with them. You take it. Take it and run. We're not more than a few hundred yards from the depot and they're waiting there for you. So run. You get away from them. Run now. - Who's they? There's no time to explain. They're gonna kill all three of you. - Who's gonna kill us? You don't understand. You've all done time in Glory prison but did you ever hear of a prison called 1935? - I know what year it is! What I don't know is who's out there waiting to kill us. Who is it? Is it Council? Answer me, damn you! - Yes, yes, it's Council and two others. How come they stopped way up there? Steve, you and your ice-sucking friend Here take Appleyard and Cottrill. Leave me handle the boy. I don't like boys. Junior, go up there and just check things out. You sure they're atheists, Steve? They're atheists, Junior. I promise you. You don't have to worry none about Junior. He's a nice, religious boy. Deputy sheriff, pop. As soon as I get on, move it up to the junction. 0ne of them's coming down the track. - What the devil are you doing with my shipment? I'm buying it from you. There. There. Lee, Johnny, let's go! - There's a law! Law? Regarding the transportation of explosives by passenger vehicles of any description or by common carrier? I have an eye for the law, my little drunken stranger! Now you go on here and sit down and don't you try and stop me again because if you do I am gonna have to hurt you real bad. Now sit down! - You ain't about to hurt nobody. Just keep standing still until we get into the depot. Which ones of you 'uns is them ex-cons. It ain't me. No, it's them here. Him, him and him. (TRAIN WHEELS SCREECH) You wanna pray? Before we get in the depot? Good... I thought you might want to because Steve, he's done told me all about you. You 'uns is atheists. I never shoot nobody but atheists. Steve, he helps me find them. I just love it when they repent. Just before I do it to them. (THUNDER BOOMS) Out there is Him. Wandering yonder in the night, searching out His sinners in the land. You wanna pray? Oh, God. Oh, Lord, is that you? (THUNDER BOOMS) Is it really you, Lord? I... I know, I know. I know, Lord, I know you've tried to show me the way but I just couldn't see. (THUNDER BOOMS) What's that you say, Lord? What's that? Did you hear that son? Did you hear? Did you hear what he said? If thine right eye offend thee, pluck it out! Have I, Lord? Have I? Then Lord, reach down thy hand now and draw from this sinner's face the eye that has so offended righteousness! I feel it! I feel it, Lord! I feel it, I feel it leaving my face! I feel your hand coming down and grabbing it. (THUNDER BOOMS) Agh! You say you won't take it, Lord? Why yes, Lord. Boy! He wants you to have it! Argh! Grab the suitcase! Much obliged, Lord. Come on! I'll cover the other side. (BRAKES SCREECH) Agh! (TRAIN WHISTLE BLARES) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLARES) Look out! I'm going out there. - What? I gotta get my book. - Alright, bring back that case of dynamite. There they go. Back to Glory. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLARES) Steve, I'm thinking mighty serious about killing that ice-sucking radio-singing little friend of yours! I got me one of 'em! I saw him fall! Where? Who is he? He's from Pittsburgh. (GUNSHOT) It appears to me Mattie Appleyard is a murderer again. (MUSIC PLAYS) I don't suppose it would be fitting of me to ask the proprietor of this establishment a personal question. Such as what? How much these beans stand him a case. I would admire so much to stock such a brand in the store. Oh, Lee, I would hate to tell you how far away that store is this morning. Mattie, we're right next to the bank. That's the first place you'd figure they'd look for us. It's the last place they'd figure us to be. What about him? He must know why we're here? I know why I'm here. I'm here to go in there like any other honest American and cash his cheque. It's your money, Mattie. You worked for it. - That's not the important part. What's important is as long as they've got that money locked up in there, they still have some of me locked up, too. If I'd had any sense, I'd have hired a boy scout troop to go down there and set rabbit traps for 'em. That's no way to look at it, Mr Grindstaff. After all, who can foresee the unforeseen? Who can foresee the unforeseen? My God, man, that's right out of Aristotle. Well, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it to be. Never mind. Who was it... Just a minute. Who was this man, you say? Sizemore. Roy K Sizemore. He was a salesman. Well, that's murder, you know. That means Appleyard can be shot on sight even in front of witnesses. That's the plan, Mr Grindstaff. As far as they know, they're not guilty of nothing. They're just coming into town to cash a cheque. (LAUGHS) It's kind of beautiful, ain't it? You think they are here in town now? - If they are not, they soon will. Of course, if you think that me and the boys can't handle it, I can go to the sheriff's office and have him call in the state police. - That's crafty thinking, Council. Then I can call in the state auditors and after they go over the books, we can invite in the state police to haul in my ass and your ass and a whole lot of other asses over to the jailhouse. Mr Grindstaff. - In a minute! Auditors is going to be poking their nose in, anyway. - Not before I get done doctoring up these convict working hope savings accounts. Brains, Council, brains. That's what it takes to keep the resources of this town from falling into the hands of convict scum. What is it now, Clara? - Good morning! Kind of foggy out there today. I imagine it'll burn off by 11 o'clock. Oh, are you... Are you Mr Grindstaff, the man who made out this cheque? Good, good. I'm awful happy to hear that cos you're the man who's gonna cash it. Don't do that! - Sit down, Council. Now, Mr Grindstaff, these are various links of Bickford safety fuse. Fuse? Fuse, that's right. They are tied in with these. These are... what's next to my heart what you might say. What's that? - Well. It's just what you're looking at, Mr Grindstaff. 12 sticks of DuPont high-velocity gelatine dynamite. And 12 mercury fulminate dynamite caps. I reckon that ought to do it, don't you think so, Mr Grindstaff? Is this your way of sticking up a bank? No. No. No, I'm not a bank robber. I'm just an American who's come into a bank to cash a cheque. I'll see you in hell first. - Well, that's very possible, Mr Grindstaff. Very possible indeed. And sooner than you think if you don't get me my money right quick. Captain Council, some of these fuses here are short burning and if you don't sit back down there and stay there, I'm gonna light one and when I do you can start counting to five, but you'll never get there because between two and four this office and this bank and half this city block will just go to kingdom come. I got 60 more pounds of it in here. Oh! The bag of blasting powder must have busted. Spilled all over the dynamite. Look at that. For God's sake man, watch your smokes! Well now, you want to go into the vault and get me my money right quick? I'm warning you, this is a crime you won't get away with. I'll go along with you on that, Mr Grindstaff. Suicide is one crime you can say that about. It's also one crime that nobody ever got locked up for. - Suicide? Don't... Don't you... Don't you understand? Don't you really see what I'm getting at? If I don't get my money, it's gonna make me feel so sad and depressed I don't think I'd really be interested in living anymore. Are you trying to tell me that you intend on blowing yourself up? Me and you and Captain Council and 50 or 60 innocent people in the immediate vicinity. - I think you're a liar. Council, do you think he means it? - In my best judgment, Mr Grindstaff, he does. Alright, I'll give your money! Can you stop that thing? Whee! (LAUGHS) You look kinda peaky, captain. Lack of sleep maybe? 25,450. One... $25,452. And 32 cents. And 32 cents. Damn you. - It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mr Grindstaff, even though you do have a little trouble understanding what's yours and what's mine. Good day. (MUSIC PLAYS) Out the back way, quick. Did you get it, Mattie? We'll all split up. They're after us for murder this time. Did you kill anyone? - No, I'll explain later, now do as I say. We'll meet under the trestle up by the station. We'll hop a freight out. Hey, you fellas! We're leaving. Have you got a kid back there? That ain't him. - How about him? - No. There's one back in there. - Watch that thing! Get down off of there. Get down off of there! While you still can. Back up. Back up! Come on, Joey. Come on. Come on, get through there! Maybe we ought to hop her when she pulls out. It's a hanging matter now. I'm not leaving Mattie. But Johnny, murder. Look, you ain't murdered nobody and I ain't murdered nobody. Now Mattie said he never would and I believe him. Mattie will know we've gone to Stonecoal. He'll follow us and he'll know. No. We've got to... go. Lee! - Tomatoes. Red Ripe. I'd sure admire to stock a delicacy like... (DOG BARKS) Lonesome? I'm Sonny Boy and this is Chanty. She's 16 years old. She is a cherry, just as fresh as this morning's milk. She ain't all we got down at the houseboat. We got store-bought cigarettes, beer, wine, whisky, anything you want. Anything. I sure could do with a good drink of whisky. Come on, then! It's just down the bank. What d'you say, Johnny? Lee, Mattie said to wait for him under the trestle. Now he wouldn't know to look on a houseboat. I sure could do with a good drink of whisky. Come on, it ain't far. Go on if you want to, Lee. But I'm waiting for Mattie. Cleo! Cleo! Chanty, go on back to your room. You can make yourself scarce too, Sonny Boy. I send you out for a live one and you come back with an ex-convict, fresh from the bricks. Cleo? - Out! Take your hat off, mister. - I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm not used to being amongst ladies. That ain't for me, it's for the flag. We respect that around here. Five won't buy you the girl. First man to get her will pay $100. That'll buy you 20 shots out that bottle there. Pour a drink, for both of us. What times! You wouldn't believe it, mister. I used to work 20 girls, 24 hours a day, right up there in Glory. Till the DARs ran me out. Come on. Well, what you served time for? Oh, just a little misunderstanding. What did the court call it? - Bank robbery. (LAUGHS) Drink up, mister, and drink free. This is on Cleo. I'm proud to have you sitting under my roof. Hey, buddy? Got a dime on you? Where's Lee? - He went on down the bank to a houseboat, Mattie. Went with some fella and a girl to get him a drink of whisky. - Hold this. Alright, let's go. Did you ever hear tell of the DARs? No, I don't think. They're ladies who had ancestors in the Revolutionary War. Them snobs! They won't let me join. I lost my great grandmother in that war. And they won't let me join. I'm real sorry to hear that... ma'am. How did she die? Infection. Some revolutionary colonel with a set of wooden teeth put a splinter in her tit! (GROANS) Makes me shudder to think about it. And it was just as honourable a wound as if she died in battle. I mean... she'd given everything she had to the country. She died doing what I do. What my ma did. And her ma did. We've been putting out for soldiers since 1776, the DARs won't let me in. (STARS AND STRIPES PLAYS) Stand up, mister. That's the Stars And Stripes Forever. (DISTANT MUSIC PLAYS) (DOG WHIMPERS) (KNOCK AT DOOR) (MUSIC STOPS) Who are they? They're my friends. You're all in trouble, ain't ya? - I wouldn't put it exactly like that, ma'am. How would you put it? - Well, bad trouble. Are they close behind ya? - Awful close, Lee, awful close. Well, any friend of a bank robber is a friend of mine. Get in that back room, quick. (DOG BARKS) (DOG WHIMPERS) Well, what brings you out on a cold morning, Dallas Council? Kicking in the doors of honest ladies all settled down for a little morning's drunk? It's not like old days, is it, Cleo? Oh, don't remind me of them days, Dallas. I ain't seen a black sheet or a whip or a mirror in a month of Sundays. Where you been since then? Tying up in any little tank town where there is a chance to make a dishonest dime. There's a skiff outside the window. Come on. Out the window. Hurry! Where are they, Cleo? I don't know what you're talking about. You oughtn't to your friends, Cleo. Now, why would I hide anybody? Why would I lie? Money? Five dollar bill and seven cents car fare? $25,452 and 32 cents. (DOG WHIMPERS) I won't be needing this. What's your name, child? - Chanty Thorn. Cleo took me in when nobody else would. Do you want to go with us? - You'd better hurry, Mister. Whoever it is, I'll stall them. I want you to get away. I know what it is like not to. (DOG WHIMPERS) (DOG WHIMPERS) Just put your substitute down on the chair and get off my boat. You work for the big rockpile, you've got no right to be here. You're making a big mistake, Cleo. I think something got into you. When was the last time you had a short-arm inspection? Just put it right down on the chair! All right, Cleo. It'll be the first loaded thing that ever had its butt in this chair. Agh! (GUNSHOT) We shouldn't have left them. We shouldn't have left that girl there, Mattie. We don't even know her. What does she mean to us? She's so young. So helpless-looking. Look, Mattie, look! That's Ohio! We're almost there. We're almost free. That old Doc's back there on the bank looking for us. Start rowing back. - What did you say? I said we're going back. But, we're almost there. We're almost free. That doesn't matter now. Are you going to turn around or not? We shouldn't have left that girl there. Get back in that seat. Give me the oars. Where they at? (SCREAMS) (DOG BARKS) You take care of her, I'll see if he hurt the woman. Well, look here, ma'am. - Fiive years. Five years I've lived in squalor. And you kind gentlemen come on board and put $25,000 in my lap. Where'd you put it? - I don't know what you're talking about. The suitcase you brung aboard, where is it? - Oh. Well, I guess you got us. - Where is it?! One side. Mattie, that's... - That's right, Lee, that's all we have. All you had, you mean. - Ma'am, about the girl here. What? The girl? Take her, I don't need her now. Just get off my boat! All of you. All right, all right. With all this money, I'm the one setting up store, now. I'll have girls like her by the score. I'll have a fine house in Wheeling. Or Cincinnati! I'll join the DARs. Go on, get! Get out! Ma'am, are you sure you know what usually happens to the greedy of this earth? They live in clover. Now, get! Well, it's none of my business, ma'am, and I'm nobody to be giving a lady like you advice, but it just seems to me that you could use some spiritual guidance. Get! So long, suckers! (STARS AND STRIPES PLAYS) (LAUGHS) She sure is patriotic. - Yes, she is. But I don't think she's ever gonna get into the DARs. There's more than one way to skin a cat! Why she do that, you reckon? A man... A man walks into a bank to cash a cheque and finds himself in a war! You couldn't have known. Who'd have thought she'd - I am sick and tired of everybody trying to steal and cheat me out of what I spent 40 years hard earning! From now on, it's gonna be a fight all the way. I've got these two hands and I've got a brain and I tell you, it's not just the money! I'd fight just the same if it was a Mason jar full of navy beans I'd spent half a lifetime saving! A man comes into town to cash a cheque. (SIREN WAILS) This is how it ends. $25,452 and 32 cents all out there in the river. Maybe. Maybe... not. Are you sure you searched that woman's houseboat thoroughly? There was no place for them to hide. I have a hunch they're still around here somewhere. And with no dynamite. It's Doc. In that old car of his. It's just like him to stay around sniffing and watching after all the others have gone. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLARES) Westbound freight. Our only chance. Alright, alright. We'll wait until the first five cars have passed. He's on the other side so that'll make a cover for us. We did it! We did it! We're just leaving and he's sitting there! In just a little while, we're going to have that store! A general store. Hey. Hey, Johnny, I got an idea. Something you can make a real career out of. You see this? That's a... That's a shoelace. I'm going to stock them in the store. And you know what part of a shoelace wears out first, don't you? The tips. So? - Don't you see, Johnny? You can make a whole career out of re-tipping shoelaces. (SINGS) You... can't see it, can you? Kids. You try to help... Can I sit with you, Johnny? - I was gonna ask ya but I didn't know whether you'd want to. Wake up, Mattie. Mattie, wake up! - What is it, what's wrong? You mind how there were no hobos on this train when we hopped her? What are you saying? How long have we been asleep? I dunno, but there's a good reason why there are no hobos on this train. This train wasn't from no place and it ain't going no place, neither. Take a look. That wasn't a freight train at all. The yard engine. They hauled us round for a while and then shunted us back on the siding. Like some kind of a dream. Five, six hours in here, we haven't moved away from Glory 15 yards. Like some kind of fools' parade. (MUSIC PLAYS) Willis, don't you think you've had enough to drink? I can't get drunk, Enoch. This is the 4th one I've had and I barely feel it. That's your conscience telling us to tell the Glory police what happened last night. It's too late, it's too late. Glass of water, please. (DOG WHIMPERS) You don't look at all happy, Willis. Must've had a bad night, hm? You take care of yourself, Willis. There's a sickness in the air. A man never knows when it's gonna get him. Mattie, what we gonna do? It's broad daylight and old Doc is sitting there in the car. I know, I know, I know. I just need time to think. There has to be a way out of this. There has to be. (DOG BARKS) Oh, hell. I'm going home, Enoch. I'll see you on tomorrow's run. Alright, Appleyard! Come on out! (BANGS ON CAR) Do you hear me? I know you're in there! Take the train down, kick two in the O.R. storage and two in number four. You hear me in there? I know you're in there! Come on out! You ain't getting away this time! (TYRES SCREECH) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) (DOG BARKS) I can't take it any more. This is all I can do for you. You understand that, don't you? - Oh, we understand. You didn't have to do this much. We appreciate it. Just remember, this is all. Well, not quite, Mr Hubbard. You could tell the police what happened last night. And get myself killed? Oh, no. Why don't you tell them? Well, I am afraid our word won't mean much against the Glory Merchant Bank. You can take off from here in any direction. Maybe now I can go home and get a little sleep. Maybe you'd get a lot more sleep if you drove right into Glory and gave your whole story to the sheriff. Are you crazy? Even if Council missed me, I'd end up in Glory prison. My wife is sick, there's a mortgage on my house. These are sorry times for honest men, Mr Hubbard. Sorry times. Appleyard? You just don't understand my position. That's one thing I do understand, Mr Hubbard. Maybe the only thing. Another eviction. - Yeah. And another bank I'm about to be in trouble with. I knew he wouldn't take them far. He's too scared for that. Are we going to stay here tonight, Mattie? - I'm tired, Johnny. I'm tired of running. It's time I did some heavy thinking for a change. I... It can't go on like this. It could be real cosy if you wanted to build a fire. How would he ever know to look here for us, Mattie? He's an evil man. Evil finds its own way. You know, it's kinda queer him being a Sunday-school teacher and all. God uses the good ones and the bad ones use God. (DOG BARKS) I guess we'll walk for a while. - Dallas. Dallas. Before we take this little walk, I'd like to ask you something. - Questions is free, Steve. When you get this money, are you really gonna give it back to the bank? You two ain't getting greedy on me, are you? You and your radio-singin' little friend. That ain't it Dallas, we've been with you all the way. I just don't think it's fair if you keep it all. - Fair? Did you say fair? What's fair? - You know. I've killed five men for Homer Grindstaff! I've pulled him and his Goddamn books out of the fire five times! I made it a little money on it, but this time it's for me. This time it's Christmas. For all of us. Sure, Steve, I'll divide with you. Where are your folks? My pa was killed in a mine and my ma, she ran away with a bootlegger. I don't have anybody now. I don't, either. Never did. You've got me. If you want me. Remember the first time we saw each other? I took one look at you and knew liked you. Well, a person just don't like somebody without any cause. You know Cleo was trying to sell me. Yes. Some of them were nice. But I never saw anybody I wanted to do that with. Do you know what I'm trying to tell you, Johnny? (DOG BARKS) That's old Bob Darnis' place. That's where your dog is running to, alright. The bank put Bob and his family out in the cold last winter. Nobody lives there anymore. Looks to me like somebody's busted in. Somebody like we're looking for. I want that Mattie Appleyard for myself. Alright, let's see how good you are. You lead off. Keep good 10 yards between us until we reach the farmhouse and then we'll all rush in together. Dallas, where do you think we should go when we get the money? Mexico. I never was no good at dividing, Steve. (GUNSHOT) What is it, Mattie? It ain't nothing. I thought I heard something. What? It's just the wind. (GROANS) Steve! Steve! (SOBS) Never did like boys. (GUNSHOT) Hello, Mr Hubbard. Do something for ya? Something wrong? It's taken me 40 years to learn to live in peace, Lee. 40 years after those two killers came scrabbling up that slag pile after me with their Winchester rifles and their Colt pistols. I had a bad temper then. The more they kept shooting at me, the meaner I felt. All I had to fight with was dynamite. That's all. And then they shot my partner dead so I did some fast priming, tying and timing. Lee, I tossed a better pitch than you ever saw in any prison baseball game. I just blew those two jokers right off from under their hats. And here I am again. Here I am. Nothing to fight with but dynamite. Where do we go from here, Mattie? That's what I'm trying to tell you. I'm through running. You and the girl and Johnny, you go ahead if you want to. I'm making my stand right now. I've always been ashamed of not knowing who I am. That's why I wanted to go back to Glory. I know who you are, Johnny. - I know now, too. (DOG WHIMPERS) (DOG BARKS) (HUMS "Shall We Gather at the River?") Do you hear that, Mattie? (HUMMING CONTINUES) Mattie! Mattie? - Is he dead? He's bleeding here. - What are we gonna do? I don't know, Lee. Can you fix dynamite? I've never handled it before. - Me, neither. Mattie talked about dynamite all the time, I never listened! Cap. It wants a cap. Be careful, Johnny, cos it could blow us all up. Even if I do, Lee, he won't get us. Get down! (HUBBUB) I'm gonna have me a store in heaven. That's the only way I'll ever get one, in heaven. This money is right back where it belongs, Clara. They'll be in jail the rest of their lives. Maybe even be hung. The prosecuting attorney's filed his charges. Let's go. (HUBBUB) (HUBBUB GETS LOUDER) Well, there they go. (LAUGHS) (HORN BEEPS) Mr Grindstaff? - Yes? Homer, you are under arrest. Prosecuting attorney here has something to say. Make out the cheque to Mr Mattie Appleyard for $25,452 and 32 cents. Cashable anywhere in the state? Anywhere from Wheeling to Stonecoal. Ma'am, I'd like to cash this cheque. (ALL CHEER) Looks like you're a hero, Mr Appleyard. No. I'm just an American coming into a bank to cash a cheque. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLARES) Does Tighe see something, Mattie? I can't understand it. We're being followed. (DOG BARKS) Mattie, what does Tighe see now? Tighe sees that store pretty clear.
