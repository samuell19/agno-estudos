'Life is like a mirror.' 'A slight fissure' 'would destroy it.' 'One mistake!' 'A small mistake.' 'Will turn your life upside down.' Pazham, dreaming, is it? Hey, Pazham, your order is ready. I've been screaming my lungs out. Come and collect it. 'My name is, Thiruchitrambalam.' 'Everyone calls' 'me, Pazham (Dork).' 'During childhood, that' 'name-calling pricked me.' 'Later I got used to it.' 'Now it doesn't' 'make a difference.' 'Shobana, my best friend.' 'Childhood friend!' 'Literally since childhood.' 812-C 'Hey, Gautham, ' 'someone's at the door.' I'm getting man. Wait! Hey, Pazham! Is it really you? Are you working for DOINK? 'It's not like he's proud' 'of me for working for it.' 'In fact, he's mocking me!' Come in, bro! It's been a while. No, I have to... 'She is An us ha.' 'I don't want her to see me.' Come in! 'I have a crush on' 'her since 5th grade.' No, I have to go. Okay. Take care. Bye! 'Until 10th grade, I was in an' 'unrequited relationship with her.' 'But I knew she was' 'out of my league!' 'So, I never professed' 'my love to her.' 'Later, I changed school.' 'And the chapter ended!' 'No use though.' 'I'm sure that idiot' 'would've told her about me.' 'Hey, step aside.' 'What happened to my order?' 'Hey, don't lay your hands on me?' 'What's wrong with it?' 'Then step aside.' 'Can't you see I'm eating?' '-Hey! Hey! Thrash that bugger!' 'Buddy, he's beating me.' 'Hey, let go!' Pazham, college students are beating up Suresh. Come with me! 'I'm a bit scared of fights.' 'I usually avoid fights.' Come on, get up! Summon the parents of college students to take them home. Okay, sir. Warn the rest of the guys. Okay, sir. 'I lead a simple life.' 'A life without any drama.' 'On weekdays I' 'work from nine to six.' 'During weekend, cinema, TV' 'and Netflix. An ordinary life.' 'Meet my grandfather.' 'Thiruchitrambalam!' Why are you late? 'My grandfather and I' 'share the same name.' 'Out of love for my grandfather, ' 'my mother named me after him.' 'She never realized her son would suffer' 'in the future because of this name.' [croons, Halamathi [Habibo - BEAST] Drink! What happened? Why is your face swollen? Tell me! Nothing happened. What did you cook for dinner? Rasam rice. Would you like to eat? I had dinner. Then why the hell did you ask what's for dinner? What else can I talk to you about? You asked what happened, right? It's him who hit me. Oh-oh! When there were so many guys, why did you just hit him? Had anyone known if he were my son, it would've been embarrassing. That doesn't mean you can beat your grown-up son. As if you raised me without any beatings. You never spared me! I'm doing the same. As his father raised him by beatings, why can't he raise his son differently? You have a point. Don't sass me old man! You're the reason for my suffering. Back then I was not sensible. It's not like you're sensible now. Fine, you must be tired after the beatings at the police station. Eat and hit the bed! You may take a leap. But I will hurtle beyond you. You can't even walk straight but claim to hurtle. To hell with you! Back in the day, I... Oh, God, please stop! Enough with the yesteryear stories. You better hit the bed. Hey, I don't need your help. [speaks gibberish] What language is this? 'It's been ages since our' 'house used to be home.' 'It's been ten years since' 'my father and I spoke.' 'We split the chores and allot' 'days accordingly to finish them.' 'If not for my grandfather, ' 'I would've left long ago.' 'A small mistake!' 'Our family shattered because' 'of one such small mistake.' 'THIRUCHITRAMBALAM' 'Dad, where's my watch?' 'It must be lying around somewhere.' 'What do you mean?' 'Check where you kept it.' 'It's not my fault!' What are you making? Breakfast! - What's for breakfast? - Omelet. Do you call omelet breakfast? Fine, don't have it! Brush your teeth before eating. It doesn't matter because you made it. Here comes a strict police officer! As if he's going to save the world. Oh, God! Shoba! Shoba, wake up! Hey, you have work to get to. You cow! - Wake up! - Get lost! Mom, she's refusing to wake up. Her office cab is about to arrive. I'm telling you now. I won't drop her to work. Oh, God, this has become a routine. Look at her sleep to glory. Wake up! Hey! You're running late for work. When women wake up early, it brings wealth to the household. Every day you wake up early. Why haven't we been blessed with wealth? I'll break your teeth! - Coffee! - Get lost! Thank you. Instead of getting ready, you're reading the paper. God help her! Bloody pig! Why were you dozing off? What else would I do? Only post noon seems like morning to me. That's when I get the feel of starting the day. Last night I called and texted you many times. Why didn't you reply? Last night I got caught up in a mess. People were fighting nearby. But I got dragged with no mistake of mine. Then I landed at my father's police station. He got an excuse and slapped me hard! By the time everything was resolved, it was too late. You get slapped by your father is not new. It's a routine though. What happened? Why did you call me last night? At work, I was offered a job opportunity in Canada. Of course, better salary. Also, I will get a good posting in 6 months. What have you decided? I don't know. I'm not sure I can stay away from my family. So, I called you to get an opinion. Do whatever you feel is right. Thanks for the help. What else is happening? Nothing much! I have to deliver food door-to-door. I always wondered, you know. While delivering the food, did you ever get tempted to open the package and eat? It does. It does everyday. But If I do it, I will get fired! As if it's a Governor's job. Every job is an important job. It's not like you're a President. Brother, please wait for a minute. Hey, you're running late for work. Hold on. I'll be back. What are you doing? My brother woke me up in the morning. Let him walk to work. Listen, if you got a problem with me, talk to me. Please don't mess with my bike. You own a lousy bike. It's a scooter for crying out loud! Can't you ride a bike like a man! Watch out. If not, you'll get hurt. I wonder how they handle her at work. - Bye. Call me. - Yeah, bye! Hi, Pazham! 'How much should I fill?' 'For 200 rupees.' - Hi! - Hey! Hey! Oh, no! What's wrong with you? Pick up the bike. Sorry, help me pick up. Please fill petrol. It's been long. I saw you the other day. You left without saying hi. 'That idiot told her about me.' I was not sure if you remembered me. Many don't remember old friends. How could I forget you? You were a class topper. What did you do after finishing school? I discontinued studies. Why? What happened? We all thought you would go places. Or you'd be successfully placed in a top position. What happened? Pay 200 rupees and take your bike. Better get an oil service. If not, it'll ruin your scooter. Sure, I'll do it. I got to go. I have a delivery to complete. Bye! Okay. Pazham, one second! Give me your number. Sure! 9840674238 I'm giving you a missed call. Save my number. Let's stay in touch. I'll whatsapp you. Bye! Are you saying she came forward, spoke, and gave her number? Yeah! I can't believe. I wonder why? What's to wonder? She wanted my number, so she asked. And she wished to give me her number, so she gave it to me. I feel I underestimated myself. Actually, I'm a stud! Something doesn't add up. What doesn't add up? You're jealous that a girl asked me for my number. Yeah right. As if I'm jealous of her! Hey, she's calling. Put it on speaker. - Put it on speaker. - Get lost! - Do it. - Wait! - Hello! - Hey, hi. How are you? Hi. I'm fine how are you? 'I'm fine. What you been up to?' 'Busy at work?' No. In fact, we employees at DOINK are on a strike. There's a conflict with tips. So, we're negotiating. I know. We, too, are unaware of what to do. We're addicted to ordering daily on DOINK. Moreover, it's too late now. Oh! I can still deliver. Are you sure? It won't be much of hassle for you? No, no, of course. Tell me, what do you want? Okay, so... Chicken pizza for me. 'Two large chicken' 'tandoori pizzas.' Okay. Okay. Tandoori pizzas large 'with extra cheese from Fat Boy.' Come on, note it down! 'Momos from Go-Go momo!' Okay, I made a note. And crispy corn from Mainland China. Good choice. It's a delicious dish. I'll deliver it 45 minutes. Perfect! Thank you so much. It really means a lot. Don't mention it. No problem. You're a sweetheart! Sweetheart! Now I know why she took your number. Why? Direct delivery! She's using you. Get lost. You always nitpick. Hey, trust you friend! I'll first deliver. Then I'll trust you. Whatsapp the order to me. Oh, God! - Hey! - Hi. - Thank you so much! - It's okay. Come, come! I'm wearing shoes. I'm wearing shoes. Come in. It's fine. I don't know what I would've done if not for you. Starved! How much? -â‚¹ 6,250 -Okay. One, three... here you go. Okay, here you go! - What is this? - Tip! No, it's okay. - Bye. - Bye. '[news] A kid named Manju went missing' 'from Jeeva park in Thygarayanagar nagar.' Hey, have it with chutney. 'The parents of the missing kid are' 'seeking the help of the police.' 'The police believe it could be' 'related to the previous kidnappings.' So, how did the meeting go? I hope it went well. What happened? Weren't you excited? What did she say? And what did you ask her? After receiving the food, did she propose to you? What happened? Come on, tell me! You see, I delivered the food. She took the food and tipped me. I told you so. She was using you. - You never listen... - Fine, okay you're right. Are you happy? I didn't mean to. I said because I didn't want my friend getting hurt. I was trying to protect you. Fine, let it go. Okay, what did you do with the tip? Did you take it or not? Only while returning did I regret not having taken the tip. To maintain dignity, I didn't take the tip. '[news] Nandakumar's six' 'year old daughter, Swetha...' 'and four year old, Rahul, ' 'son of Arivanandham' 'Were playing in' 'front of their house.' 'Unidentified men on the bike' 'kidnapped them both in split seconds.' When will you find these children? We'll find them soon. Won't abandon the case. [loud song playing on radio] I'm watching the news. Lower the radio volume. Tomorrow, first thing in the morning... deposit this money in Pazham's account. It's an usual thing. Pazham as in my son, not under your name. Don't forget that my money raised you. - Hello! - Where are you? What do you want? Bring me four beers when you come home in the evening. You're jobless at home. Why don't you go and get it yourself? Isn't that your job profile? Get it! I'll handle you when I get home. Hang up! You never gave me right directions. 'Okay, come to the first floor.' I'm on the first floor. Here you go! I didn't place an order. - Room #6? - The next door. Hey, scram! 'A few people come into' 'our lives unexpectedly.' 'But we don't realize they might' 'do good for us in the future.' Sir, I'm an electrician. I'm here to check what happened. Comeback later. Nab him! It's the police! Yes, sir! Hey, listen! Hey, let go. I said let go! 'Take him to the station.' I'm hell-bent on killing you. Keep moving. I won't spare you. '[news] Sir, I hope' 'the kid is safe.' 'We were able to save the' 'kid as we got there in time.' 'Child is safe!' 'Who were the kidnappers?' 'What was the purpose?' 'Investigation is going' 'on. That's all for now.' 'Sir, one more question.' '[news] For a while in Chennai...' What is it? He's giving interviews as if he's the hero. It's not like he found the kid. I informed on time. Only then do they catch the kidnappers. Doesn't that make me the hero? It's a shame they call themselves police and the public trusts them. You better shut up now. Dad, ask him not to overdo it. I won't stay quiet. It's not like I'm lying. I'm telling the truth. Ask him not to disrespect my work. I won't stop talking. What would he do? - Bloody... - Hey, that's enough! Pegs himself to be a hero? As soon as he heard the bullet sound... your grandson ran for his life. The entire police station was laughing. Why am I always scared? - Pazham! - Enough grandpa! Get out! - I better leave for good. - Hey! Hey, Pazham... Why is it so loud upstairs? My son hit my grandson. My grandson got pissed and went to the terrace. I'm not sure when things will settle down. How many times should I tell you? Yell as much as you want. Why did you raise your hand on him? This is not right uncle. I'm too young to be giving you advice. What you doing is not right. I have nothing else to say. Brother, did you happen to see Thiru? As if I don't have anything to do. Get lost! Why are you yelling at me? Why didn't you give biryani on Bakrid? If I have to feed you biryani, I'll have to run a biryani shop. Get lost! [fruit vendor calling [out on the street] Hey, dad asked you to check the bank account statement. Hey, where are you going? She doesn't give a damn. Buffalo! What's on your face? Face pack! It'll make your skin smooth and glowing. No way! Nothing can change your looks. Where is Thiru? Tell me that I'm as handsome as Hrithik Roshan, and I'll tell you. I would never say that. - Tell me! - I have no clue. He was in a rush to meet someone. He hasn't returned yet. Who is he meeting? He saying that he's going to meet a girl. I called him 4-5 times but no answer. Neither he came to see me off in the morning at the gate. Since morning he was busy decking himself. He kept changing clothes. He was very proud that he was going on a date with a girl. Is her name An us ha? The other day I was very disturbed. I don't know what I was thinking. I was just trying to be nice. But... It's okay. Let it go. You already apologized for it. If you wanted to be nice to me there are other ways to be nice to me. Other ways? What ways? Like... The hug you gave me. Something like that. Will it work out? Shoba, as far as I know, about Pazham, and from my observation, this will not work out. I believe this is how you are. Partying, drinking, and loud music! Why do you ask in a judgmental tone? I didn't mean to offend. During childhood, we wouldn't dress as we do now. Our parents would've whacked us. But it has become normal now. You're talking like an old man. We both belong to the same generation. There's no connection between age and the way of life. Our worlds are different. I guess we both at present are in the same world. When he calls, I won't pick up. Also, I won't reply to his messages. Don't tell him that I came over. '[lady] Dear, come over here...' I'll make him suffer for four days and patch up. Shucks! Have some shame! Hrithik Roshan, I'll tear your mouth. Get lost! Shobana, why have you been yelling? - Get lost! - You get lost! Hey, how many messages do you get in a row? Check who has been texting. Obviously, Thiru. Then talk to him. I won't! He's gone lurking without telling me. If I check it'll show that I'm online. Then he'll know I'm avoiding him. Idiot what if it's an emergency. I'm sure it's not an emergency. '[Thiru] Idiot, my' 'scooter broke down.' 'I'm near Cafe de Paris.' 'Come and pick me.' Poor thing, he's stranded on the road. Go and get him. Go! I thought you were sending your brother. How come you came? Why are you dressed like a waiter? Hop on! Am I really dressed like a waiter? Yes! I don't even have to turn around. I can sense the look on your face. Don't be angry. I didn't have much time. Do you expect me to prepare for the date or explain things to you? As if you were well-prepared! Don't underestimate me! Do you know, we kissed? Did you say you guys kissed? Kiss as in she kissed me on my cheeks. Come on, that's very normal these days. It's not normal. Three hugs and one kiss. What's with the reaction? Did she give a clear signal that she likes you? She spoke with her eyes. Not mere words. Eyes? How is that? "Won't the clouds' 'form, my dear?" "Won't there be' 'drizzles, my dear?" "Won't the body' 'get drenched, dear?" "Won't the fire get' 'extinguished, dear?" "If you speak through your' 'eyes, What would I do?" "I am getting confused" "The more I see you, ' 'The more I long to see you" "The more I speak to' 'you, The more I like you" "I seem to forget' 'the old notes" "Your touch is' 'soothing like a feather" "The more I see you..." "The more I speak to you..." "Old notes" "Your soothing touch" "Won't the clouds' 'form, my dear?" "Won't there be' 'drizzles, my dear?" "Before the drizzles touch' 'the ground, I can smell it" "The love turns' 'the soil into a doll" "I feel your love And I' 'ask for more and more" "And I ask for more and more" "The woes that were with me" "I see them getting' 'vanished in the air" "I follow the paths' 'That my legs take me" "I opened the doors to my' 'heart That I was shy to do so" "I'm sailing away' 'As the life takes me" "If you speak through your' 'eyes, What would I do?" "I am getting confused" "The more I see you, ' 'The more I long to see you" "The more I speak to' 'you, The more I like you" "I seem to forget' 'the old notes" "Your touch is' 'soothing like a feather" "The more I see you..." "The more I speak to you..." "The old notes..." "Your soothing touch" "Won't the clouds' 'form, my dear?" "Won't there be' 'drizzles, my dear?" "Won't the body get drenched?" "Won't the fire' 'get extinguished?" It's easy. First, do this step. Sandhya, give us two minutes. Okay. I spoke to grandpa. He's asking me to propose right away. If not, she'll friend-zone you. He suggested to strike when it's hot. What do you say? I concur your grandpa is more intelligent than you. Propose right away! That's the right thing to do. I don't know how to propose. Suggest me an idea. 'Next on stage are youngsters' 'from B Block of our colony.' [music playing on stage] Shobana! What is it? Shobana, suggest me an idea. This is not the right time. If you forget your step, I'll kill you! Who else would I ask? I have only you as my friend. Do you know to create art or music, or can you write a poem? Girls like who create art. I write good poems. Shall I write a poem for her? Great. Write a beautiful poem and propose to her. It'll definitely work out. 'Hey, girl, I like you' 'Not sure how to profess to you' 'Overgrown stache is a nuisance' 'Shall remove it' 'on the wedding day' What? What was that? I wrote this poem for you. I believe poems should carry humor. So... No doubt, it's hilarious. But... What does it mean? It means... I have had a crush on you since 6th grade. Our chemistry is better now that you've stepped into my life again. To be honest... back in the day I did not dare to propose. But now I feel like proposing. Erm... I love you! Hey, stop joking! Joking? Stop kidding. I never thought of you like that. - But... - But, what? But you flir... You flirted with me. See, I accept that I was flirting with you. But that's all to it. Flirting! It was not love. Okay? How come? Aren't they the same? You know what, you were right about it earlier. Our worlds are completely different. In your world, flirting could turn into love and marriage. It's not the same in my world. I may be slightly interested in a boy. But that's not love! Flirting and love are different things. I'm really sorry if I led you on, but... I never looked at you like that. Hi... Another five minutes. Yeah, I'll be there. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, bye! Leaving? Yeah, I... I have to meet someone. Are you serious? Yeah, that's what she said! I was fine with everything. She said not to joke. I'm professing my love, and she thought I was joking. Hey! She doesn't know what she was talking about. She seemed confused. What surprised me is your poem didn't impress her. Poem? What poem? I proposed to her with a poem, and she rejected it. Recite the poem. Hey, let me recite it. 'Hey, girl, I like you' 'Not sure how to profess to you' '-Overgrown stache' 'is a nuisance' -Great! 'Shall remove it' 'on the wedding day' Do you call this a poem? What's wrong with it? It is in sync with the current trend. Have you both lost your mind? Get up and leave! She may have said yes if not for the poem. He is oblivious to love. Old man! Do you want me to leave you alone? Yeah, you leave. I'll see you in the morning. What happened? Tanked! Oh, no! What would he do now? What else? He must be listening to sad love songs. [song playing on radio] I had my doubts. What doubt? You should play hard to get. What? Hard to get... I know what it meant! We should not make the first move. Oh! A butterfly... If you grab it, Its wings will crumble or fly away. It should come on its own and land on you. Hold the butterfly and kiss it. What do you know about the current generation to offer advice? Hey... back in the day when I was in love... Her name was Muthuram. Sounds like a man's name. Muthu and Ram both sound like man's names. - No, it's a woman. - Okay. During my childhood, I had a crush on her. But I never professed my love to her. I used to follow her everywhere. I'd do things that'll attract her attention. At the same time I'll keep an eye on her. That's how I impressed her. Grandmother's name wasn't Muthuram. - No. - Okay. After that, did you guys break up? I started to like Sentamizhselvi. Grandmother's name wasn't Sentamizhselvi as well. No! Okay. What did you learn from it? I learnt that If we visit your native many would resemble your face. Despite all odds, you should know how to approach a girl. I feel embarrassed to call you my grandson. Pazham! - What is it? - Cake! For what? The girl I loved said yes to me. Take it. The cake is delicious. - Please take a piece. - Sure. It was your plan all along. Sadist! You sent him to piss me off. Buffalo! Is this how you beat someone? It's hurting! How dare you piss me off on purpose? Hey, my brother is genuinely in a relationship. I'm not saying this because you're my best friend. She's not the right match for you. Agreed that you're average, and she's fantastic! Even if she roams around the world looking for a guy she can't find a match like you who'd take good care of her. Tell me, would she? Did you take it seriously? I was just joking. To be honest you were served! The movie has started. I told you to come early. Wait, step aside. Brother, please, one minute. One minute. Brother, one minute. Brother, one minute. One minute. Thank you. Go! Thank you, brother. Look, I offered you to buy popcorn, and you refused. It would be best if you didn't reach out to my popcorn. I don't want it! Didn't I offer to buy you? Now I have to buy a new one. Go ahead! Brother, please be quiet! Sister, mind your business! Will you please shut up! Someday I'm going to get beaten up. Hey, he's Pazham, right? Hey, DOINK! Do you deliver to theatres? Get two popcorn and ice creams for A1, A2 & A3. Shut up! Dude, that was awesome! Add two colas and cold coffees to the order. DOINK! DOINK! You're being really mean. We should not spare him! - '-Two samosas! - Anything else?' Just look at this. Hey, it's the DOINK guy. He had the audacity to actually come and ask her out, right? Stop it! He really thought that he could get her man. See how he looks. Stop laughing at him. It's not funny guys. Just behave yourself. - It's fine. - Shobana! Shobana! Shobana, hear me out... Hey, what's your problem? What the hell is your problem? - What? - What the hell? Shobana, hear me out. Listen, mind how you talk to me. One slap, and you'll be looking for your teeth. Calm down, Shobana. What are you looking at? You were passing comments inside the theatre. Peg, yourself to be a big shot, is it? Shobana! It looks like he finally found someone in his league, guys. That's not funny. Just stop it! Bloody! Shobana, let's leave. What? Why were you pissed and silent on our way home? Nothing! I asked what happened? I said, nothing! - Fine, bye! - Bye! Don't you have any sense? He spoke so low of me. You were standing there silent. Why didn't you slap him? Look, it's better to avoid trouble. We should not add fuel to it. Nothing would happen even if I reacted to it. The right thing to do is to avoid trouble during these situations. Say that you're scared! - Shoba, listen... - What is it? I agree you didn't want to react when he insulted you. But he spoke ill and insulted me. But you didn't say a word. I defended you! Don't you think you should've defended me? What are you so scared... Yes, I'm scared! See, you know everything about me. I'm not too fond of it that you still speak to me like this. I understand! That doesn't mean you continue to avoid problems. It's all in your head... Hey, get lost! Get lost! - I will leave for good! - Go! I don't want anyone who doesn't get me. Go! I'm leaving! A person will come into your life to understand you. Someone beyond me! To hell with you! 'Say that you're scared!' 'Say that you're scared!' Oh, no! I burnt a hole. It doesn't matter. Let him wear it as it is. [sings a song] Where would I sleep now? Serve me dinner. It's been served! Fool! Who brought this wedding invitation. It was sent by your in-laws. Why did you put the invitation on my table? We would have to go, son! Have you finished both the beers? What is this? Dad, what the hell is this? Whose turn was it to iron clothes? Who ironed the clothes? - I did. - Do you have any sense? I have been summoned to the commissioner officer tomorrow to congratulate. You expect me to wear this? I'm getting old. It was a mistake. How could you be so irresponsible? You burnt the shirt and hung it on the hanger. Who would inform me? I couldn't have done anything if I had found out in the morning. I should have informed. I didn't! I thought of letting you know during dinner. People in this house are out to torture me. I don't like to live in this house. Listen, why do you burden yourself with something you don't know. You don't have do anything. Just relax! Let him do it. Or I'll do it myself. Eh, it was me who burnt the shirt. What would he do? Is he doing it on purpose? Is he? Can't he stop creating troubles? How long do you expect me to bear this nonsense? I have been very patient with him. But don't expect me to stay the same. Likewise, ask him to shut up and leave. He's being disrespectful. He doesn't deserve respect. He burnt the shirt, and the top of it was arrogant. What is so bad about me burning his shirt? As if I destroyed his life! I wonder why the commissioner is rewarding him. It was me who cracked the case. Look, I'm sparing him for your sake. If not I would've disowned him! Hey! What the hell is wrong with you? Who is he to disown me? I disowned him long ago. Hey, what the hell is happening? Hey! I, too, know how to create a scene! I've done all of it growing up too. What the hell does he want? Ask him to get out and find a living. He hasn't done squat but is full of arrogance. So much anger! What does he want? What the hell does he want? I want my mother! Can he bring her back? - Pazham! - Enough with Pazham! How long are you going to escape reality? Hey, calm down! I want my mother and sister. Can he bring them back? He killed them both! Hey! Come here! Get out, damn it! I said, get out! Go! Hey, Pazham... Don't I have the right to raise my hand on you? I, too, should've died on that day. But I escaped death with minor fractures. But my father escaped without a scratch. He did everything. And he demeaned the other day. That I'm afraid and ran away. Why do you think I'm afraid? After the accident, I've been afraid all along. Anyone in my situation would've been the same. Right in front of my eyes, my mother and my sister... Tell me something. Was I like this before? You know I was a troublesome boy during my college. You have bailed me out! That doesn't mean you could hurt your father. I spoke the truth. During childhood, I used to play downstairs, and my mother would yell, asking me to come to dinner. I turn around today to see if she's on this terrace. I wish that she would come back. Grandpa, I'm not going to stay in this house anymore. In the morning, I'll leave. It'll be good for my father and me. Where would you go? And what would you do? I'll figure out something. You don't have to worry about me. You sort things out in the morning. Now go inside and sleep. I'll come. You leave. Hey, Pazham! I was pissed and threw away food. I'm hungry now! Go and get me food. Hello! 'Thiru, I need to' 'speak you for a minute.' Hey, I already told you. You better find a brave friend and let me off the hook. 'Come to Suriya Hospital right away.' Why? 'Please listen. Come' 'right away to the hospital.' What happened? Why should I come to the hospital? What happened? Why are you crying? Tell me what happened? Where is grandpa? Are you his son? He suffered a massive stroke. Left-sided paralysis. Left hand and left leg paralyzed. It'll be difficult to move around. Perhaps physiotherapy could cure it. He's out of danger. There you go. Please be careful. That's about it. Be careful. Place your leg over here. Give me a shout if you need anything. Close the door on your way out. What is it? Is he okay? I mean, how would he manage? He would find a way to manage. He has endured worst than this. It's just one hand and leg. You don't worry about it. I'm not worried though! It looks great only when he beats me. That suits him. The other day he hit me at the police station. He walked up and down like a lion. The entire police station was afraid of him. This paralysis is making him look weak. He's your father. But he's my son! This family was once happy. Everything got jinxed. Dad! Dad, help me go to the loo. Hey, Pazham. He's calling you as he needs to go to the loo. Hey! Dad... Dad... Dad! Dad! Hey, Pazham, wake up! He fell. Wake up, damn it! [mumbles] Hey, he fell. Please wake up! I'm not able to wake up. Hey, dad. Dad! Dad! Would you ever forgive me? I did not do it on purpose. It's not like I wish to live in hell where my son despises me. I should've died on that day. But I survived. Since that day, I've been slowly dying by the day. When they... When they took me to hospital after I suffered a stroke I was relieved that I was going to die. But my ill fate, I once again survived. Please forgive me! 'When my father asked' 'me for forgiveness' 'my vent-up anger of 10' 'years seemed meaningless.' 'Lack of communication' 'was the problem.' 'One word would' 'change everything.' "A flower of' 'happiness blossoms" "and sheds tears" Don't cry! "A tired heart that has' 'borne so much, feels free now" I'm heading for work. "A flower of happiness' 'blossoms And sheds tears" "A tired heart that has' 'borne so much, feels free now" "I lean on you as my' 'legs are worn and torn" "When you nurture me" "I become your child' 'Though I gave birth to you" "A flower of happiness' 'blossoms And sheds tears" "A tired heart that has' 'borne so much, feels free now" Your single source of income won't be enough anymore. Your father's source of income has ended. Medical expenses have gone up. So you need to take care of all the expenses. Why are we spending so much? It's just us men in the house, and the expenses are through the roof. Why is there â‚¹7,000 next to your name? What do you need it for? That's personal! You need to do two jobs. Only then can you run the family. You're jobless. Why don't you find a job? A person should work hard when he can do it. I did. And should rest when the time is up. And I'm resting. As it is I'm working too much. As you were pissed with your father, you discontinued your studies. In the process of punishing him, you destroyed your future. Even the double graduates are finding it hard to get a job. You better complete your graduation through correspondence. At least you may have a chance. Why should I come along to get you an application? Dad, I noticed Thiru reading a lot of books. But why? I have saved up money for him. Why don't you give it to him? He might start a business. Don't I know that? I want him to complete graduation. That's why I pushed him to get another job. It was I who asked Shobana to make him study. I have become a burden on you guys. Yes. But what can we do about it? For the past 25 years, I've been jobless. That makes me a burden on you and Thiru. It's a great feeling when my son and grandson are taking care of me. There's a time when bearing the burden is happiness. Also, there's a time when being a burden is happiness too. It all depends on the nature of our children. You're lucky to have a great son. "The colorful sky' 'makes my heart dance" "The angels are' 'singing my name" "You were the poem' 'That I wrote yesterday" "And you are the shadow' 'That I search for today" "You are a boon showered' 'upon me By the god" "For all the penance I' 'did Over my seven births" "Your lap is all I need" "and your love is' 'all I need till I die" "A flower of happiness' 'blossoms And sheds tears" "A tired heart that has' 'borne so much, feels free now" "I lean on you as my' 'legs are worn and torn" "When you nurture me" "I become your child' 'Though I gave birth to you" What do we do with the invitation? It took me ten years to face my son. I don't know how to face my in-laws. I can't take it if they blame me for their daughter's death. You'll have to face them! We can't just abandon relationships. Give it a thought. Be careful and eat on time. Don't go alone anywhere. Please take care of her. You're making a scene as if she got married and going abroad. Shut up! I have never sent her on a journey alone before. Auntie, don't worry. I'll take good care of her. Damn you! She has to take care of you too. Fine, you leave mom. Don't create a scene. - Okay, bye. Go safe. - Bye! Stop worrying! 'All these years, you both' 'never visited my grandparents.' 'At least I should' 'have visited them.' 'I kept contemplating, ' 'and years passed.' 'They're going to hold me for it.' 'We could not visit. But' 'they could've visited us.' Listen, the issue got blown out of... Bloody sinners! For me? Here drink! What are you discussing? Once we sort out things and return, we should get you married soon. What's the rush for my marriage? Right now, there are only three members in our family. I'll be gone soon. I said, I will die soon! I thought you'd say nothing would happen to me. My statement is not going to keep you alive. Eventually, you'll die one day. Fine, what would happen after you die? Since my daughter-in-law died, nothing has been exemplary. Your mother took great care of the house, you and your father. I'm looking for an equal match for you. It sounds good, though. But I'm not very lucky. Just because one girl rejected you, you should not lose hope. I didn't mean it that way. It's a huge process. Get the girl's number and wait to see who texts first. Even if she texts first we pretend to be busy. And reply to the text after a while. We wait until the girl comes online on whatsapp. Once she's online we go offline. Then feel sorry about ourselves as it's only you calling her. And when the phone rings, we get excited to attend to find it's a telemarketing call! Then torment ourselves wondering if her signals meant friendship or relationship. Then pine on the doubt if she feels the same about us. And finally, when we go and propose to a girl. We wouldn't know if she's going to say yes or not. Just the thought of it wants me to rip my head off. Pazham, arranged marriage is the best option. So, boys have to do so much to get a girl? We girls have only to choose. The boys do the rest. Wait and watch before we return home after the wedding... you'd meet the girl meant for you. Do you think so? Mix it well! WELCOME 'I can't take it if they blame' 'me for their daughter's death.' Don't panic. Calm down! Hey, listen... Shenbagam! Shenbagam! Look who is here. How could you abandon us? What did we do wrong? Relationships are forever, no matter the differences. We have no one but only you people. We have no one but only you people. It's disheartening to see you in this state. It's really sad! - Granny! - My son! Do you recognize me? I do, dear. Hope you're doing well. I'm doing well. Grandpa, how are you? I'm good, son. Come on, let's go inside. Welcome son-in-law. That's enough. Enough for me. Serve her. How do we eat this? Put it down. Hopeless! Look, this is your mother before marriage. Wow! Granny, shall I take this picture home? Sure you can. This is your mother and father on the day of the wedding. He looks like exactly like you. He looks funny! Shall I take this too? No! I only have one copy of it. Okay, please give it to me. I'll return it, don't worry. Hey, take a picture of it. Did you take a picture of this photo? Then take a picture of this too. Let the original copy be with me. You're very sharp, grandma! Your mother, when she was eight years old. She looks exactly like my sister. I was ignorant, and you lost both your daughter and granddaughter. I did not know how to face you people... I'm aware that you took great care of my daughter. Never did she call complaining about you. She lived like a queen. Fate had other plans. We did not want to trouble you. Thus no one visited. Dad! Thiru! Hey, I stood up! Hey, Thiru! Dad! May I help you? Neelakandan, sir. He's not in town. They will return after ten days. - And you? - I'm his colleague. Your name? 'His face looks familiar.' Mister! - Hey, listen! - What is it? My son-in-law has arrived. - Oh, is it? - He's following us. Maari heard your son-in-law has arrived. Yes, both son-in-law and grandson are here to attend the wedding. I'm very happy to hear. They would've turned it into a feast if we had informed them earlier. How do you manage in Chennai? We can't compare it with our village. I adjust. We'll meet tonight once they finish with the rituals. Sure, we shall meet! Country brutes! Be here sharp at 10:00 p.m. He is your uncle. - How are you? - I'm good! Do you remember auntie from Thevaar? He's her brother's brother-in-law. Okay. Do you recognize him? It's Subbaraj uncle. He's your mother's younger brother. It's been ten years. How are you uncle? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing well too. [seer citing wedding invitation] Uncle, hold on for a minute. As a tribute to the bride, we will dance. Why do you need to dance? That's the trend these days. Right! Do you think it would be as good as our performance? "Who? Who is he?" "Your future husband?" "Who? Who is he?" "The King of your" "head weight?" "Who? Who is he?" "Your future husband?" "Who? Who is he?" "The King of your" "head weight?" "Shine like a moon" "Strikes like Indiran" "And scores like" "a champion..." Check out the 4th girl dancing in the second row. "The beauty of a" "young girl's footsteps" She is getting her steps wrong. She's dancing well. "Who? Who is he?" Who shall I ask about the girl? Hey, you're the father of the bride. Instead of tending to the guests, you sat down to eat. Won't the father of the bride get hungry? The guests are enjoying the meal. You mind your business. Why did I even get married to him? Hi, son, did you eat? I will eat shortly. Please sit down and eat. Sure! "He's the right person!" - Uncle! - Son... You don't have to... I don't mind. You have not forgotten our culture. Such great traits and respect. - Uncle. - Wow! I was dying to hear that word. - Please repeat son. - Uncle. Fantastic! How can I help you, son? I hope you watched the dance. Yes, it was good. Indeed it was good. Could you tell me who the 4th girl in the second row is? She looked familiar. I would like to know if she's from our village. Son, why haven't you eaten anything? I thought you were hungry. Sure, I'll eat soon. Come right away. You carry on. I'll follow. I think you're in a bad mood. - Who? Me? - I'll see you later. See you, uncle. Now I get why he was sassing. How could I dance by learning the steps last minute? I told you, people. But no one paid heed to me. I know... 3rd step was wrong, so did 7th step and 11th step. All the steps were wrong! Everyone was laughing at me. It was so embarrassing. Hey, don't take it your heart. Calm down. No one would've noticed. You were dancing in the second row, not the first one. No one would've noticed. I'm sure everyone noticed. You are very mean! I'm being honest. Regardless her dance was kind of cute. Perhaps she's the girl Senior Pazham was referring to. Oh, God, now you have stuck that idea into my head. Whenever I see her, I'm going to think about it. Oh! Oh, really? It's not like you would've considered her to be your sister. Don't be ogling inside a temple. It's a sin! I'm a 90s kid. We visit temples just to ogle. You continue your prayers. Where did he go? Hey, go and talk to her. You're here only for a week. Given a year, I wouldn't do anything. A week is impossible. Go! Hello! You're circling left. It would be best if you circled to the right. It would be best if you did not circle left in the temple. You should circle to the right. Oh, to the right. Correct! What is your name? Ranjini. Nice! You dance well. I'm not lying. You were good. Thanks! What did you tell her? She left crying. I complimented on her performance... She knows that she didn't perform well. And your compliment made her cry. It's all because of you. I would've handled it in my style. To hell with your idea. Get lost! I deserve it. I left my busy schedule and came down to give you company. I had enough of your company. Now leave! I'm leaving. I'm leaving this evening by train. Do as you please! - Get lost! - Hey... "Three-fourths" "worth of a penny" "My dear!" That was awesome! "A crispy treat" "born to my sister" "In love, she's a mother" "In wisdom, she" "is an old lady" "In short, she is an..." Who? "Grandam!" Hey, she got pissed off! "Three-fourths worth" "of a penny, my dear" "A crispy treat" "born to my sister" "A crazy woman" "who has been left free" "End the atrocities" "My dear, why so arrogant?" "Keep walking ahead" "I am your beloved" "Sweetheart, be" "a little obedient" "My route is unique" "Why this drama?" "Hey, chatterbox" "Come let us take it head on" "Hey, grandam! Hey, grandam!" "Hey, grandam! Hey, grandam!" "Hey, grandam! Hey, grandam!" "If you see" "She is a spinning top She" "is the pearl inside the snail" "No one can equal you" "Sigma female" "Her walk will set ablaze" "Shall I accompany you?" "Hey, smoldering summer bowl" "Should you fall on" "my lap, It would be jolly" "Draped in half saree" "Begins a new love story" "If I hurt it I would be dead" "If you laugh" "If you stare" "If you laugh, If you stare" "You are my love, grandam" "Hey, grandam! Hey, grandam!" "Hey, grandam! Hey, grandam!" "Three-fourths worth" "of a penny, my dear" "A crispy treat" "born to my sister" "Crazy woman who" "has been left free" "You're the world to me" "My dear, why so arrogant?" "Keep walking ahead" "I am your beloved" "Sweetheart, be" "a little obedient" "My route is unique" "Why this drama?" "Hey, chatterbox" "Come let us take it head on" "Hey, grandam! Hey, grandam!" Uncle! Uncle! - Oh, God! Who was it? - Oh, no! What the hell is wrong with you? Someone whispered "uncle" into my ears. As if some girl would come late in the night to romance you. It wasn't a girl. It was a man. Damn you man! Get back to sleep. I've got things to do in the morning. Was it a dream? - Uncle! - It wasn't a dream! - You? - Shush! Sorry! I have a small doubt. What is it? In the second row... fourth girl. Do you know where she lives? Why are you asking me this? Uncle! Unc... Let's go. "Play your card." "Deal the cards already." Welcome, son-in-law. What are you up to so late at night? I came to check if everything is okay with you people. We are good! Don't trouble yourself. [indistinct chatter] You carry on with game. Look she's here. Let's go. - Go safe. - Continue playing. Come on. I'll show you around the village. Please hear me out. Yes! There's a window. I think this is her room. Yes. This is the room. What do you plan to do? Don't knock! Oh, no, someone is coming. Damn, it's an old woman. I don't see anyone. Hey, why are you howling like a Dog? Dog does not meow! Stand up. Phew! Now that you've seen the girl. Let's go! Oh, no! Hello. At the temple, I complimented your performance. But you left crying... To be honest, I liked your performance. It was natural and good. So, I came down to apologize. Don't mind me. - Uncle, I... - Dear, hold on! I brought him here as he wanted to apologize to you. Now that you've apologized, let's leave. - What's your name? - Pazham! Pazham (fruit)? - What kind of fruit? - Banana! Get back to sleep! - Let's go! - Shut up! My name is, Thiruchitrambalam. Said. Heard. Now you go! - Let us leave. - Goodnight! - Let's go. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Let's go! Shobana, where is Pazham? I don't know. I've been looking for him too. Wait, let me look for him. Not sure where he went. What are you doing? I don't feel like going back home. I'll miss my grandparents. I feel like staying back. I don't have anyone at home. Would you miss your grandparents? Or all this drama to seek Ranjini? Okay, okay. Don't get angry. Come on. Everyone is looking for you. We're getting late. What is it? You see, we're leaving now... I want to meet and talk to her. I kind of like that girl. Only if I keep in touch, I'll know if it'll work out or not. Thought as much. I don't even have her number. How do I keep in touch? Please come out. Crying is not the solution. You couldn't get them to stay for another week. Even after a week, they would have to leave. I'll tell them you're not coming and see them off. Please shut up. Trying to be over-smart. I... I'll wait over there. My folks will look for me. What is the matter? I'm leaving town. So I thought of bidding bye to you. Okay. Yes. I didn't know how to keep in touch with you. So, if you could share your number... Why should we be in touch? I was asking. Why should we be in touch? You're right. Why should we be in touch? Just like that, I was asking for your number. Okay, I'm taking my leave. If my father sees me talking to you, he'll bring mayhem! - Okay. - Take care. Bye! Let's go. Did you eat? That's a lot of food. You don't seem to listen. Grandma, what happened? Why? Why are you crying? Please be careful, dear. Okay. Take care of your health. Look, I've packed all kinds of sweet treats for you. It's all good. They're running late. Let them go. Here, keep this phone. Often we can speak over the phone. Also, we can see each other over the phone. - Video call? - Yes! Son! I'll take my leave, uncle. As you were here, I felt I was young again. No phone for you! Come on, dear! What happened? I was okay being single. It's you who got me confused. I didn't do anything. You claimed I'd meet a girl even before the wedding ceremony. I'm not responsible if you're looking at the wrong place. I don't get you. Turn around and look. - That's Shobana! - Obviously! I meant Shobana. Hey! Shobana can't be my love or lover. Fine, then explain what is love to me? Love is... It happens when you see someone... I can't seem to get a grasp of it. So, you have no idea what exactly it is, love? Love is... Two people like each other, understand and vibe together, and share their life. Oh-oh! So, in the past six months, you met two girls you liked, understood, and vibe together and ended up without sharing life with them. Beauty is all that matters. Boys change their personalities to please the girls. And blindly believe in what they like. As far as boys get the girls, they consider love is everything that the girl desires. That is the reason relationships and marriages don't last long. It's a hormonal change. You have confused me! Shobana knows you better than you know yourself. And you know Shobana well too. Love! I'm not able to see her as my love. Why don't you change your perspective about her? Give it a try. Boys never notice the love that's right in front of their eyes. They always look for love elsewhere. "Feeble? Faltering?" "Mind is full of confusions?" "Is it there or not" "This is the cause of my stress" "I have already been shunned" "I have not been lucky with love" "I don't understand what's the matter" "I don't know my state now" "Feeble? Faltering?" Oh, God no! "Mind is full of confusions?" "Is it there or not" "This is the cause of my stress" Yeah. They both look adorable. Let's eat. You go, I'll join you. Come, let's eat. Did you notice? You guys are behaving like husband and wife. He doesn't like eggplant. If you have potatoes, please bring them. - Shut up and eat. - Get lost! "You are the chariot of my life" "I did not realise this earlier" "Are you the one for me?" "God has tested me enough" "I loved you so much, So I am down with love fever." "What will I do? Oh God, you tell me" "You've stole my heart" "Now I am caught" Like I taught you, keep focus and write your exam. You'll clear your exams! In the evening, I'll meet you at the gate. "My friend now is my love" It's very simple. You take permission, vomit, then go back and write your exam. Don't panic! Hey, I'm talking to you! Do you hear me or not? I heard! I need to speak to you about an important matter. What is it? Tell me! I better finish my exam and tell you in the evening. My head will explode! I can't wait till evening. You better start talking. No, I'll speak to you in the evening. Fine, your wish. We're running late. I'm coming! Why did you ask me to come to the terrace? It's not like we can't speak elsewhere. How did you do your exam? You want coffee? Tell me! What is the matter? Do you want to borrow money? Can you please shut up for a moment? Okay-okay! Just now, we shared coffee. Likewise, why should we not share our lives too? Don't you get it? Eh... Let us get married! Forget that something like this happened. Okay? There should be no awkwardness between us. Idiot! Go and study for your exams. It's all because of you! It's all because of you. It was for your own good. At least she and I would've been friends. Now I lost that too. I don't know how to face her. You have destroyed our relationship. I'm an old man. Old men should stay put! "The whole-hearted love I have for you" "Is the sin that I have committed" "My shadow has also left me" "It looks like it is also angry with me" "I haven't professed..." We're running late. I have two more pick ups to complete. I'm coming! I don't see Thiru anywhere. Shut up and drive! "You are not at fault" So, you won't speak to me anymore? "And you are not me" "The sweet talker The flowering creeper" "You have left me speechless" "The moon. The parrot" Where is he? He must've gone to the store. His bike is parked downstairs. He may have walked to the store. Oh... okay! Hey, eat before you pity on yourself. "The sweet talker The flowering creeper" "You have left me speechless" "The moon. The parrot" "You torture me as you like" Thiru... take me out for dinner. We received an order to send you to Canada from our team. It's a good opportunity for you. If you reject it again, you'd never get an opportunity like this. - Shobana! - I'll take it sir. Good Shobana. Finally, you made the right decision. You may have to leave soon. You plan accordingly. What's that reaction? I said I love Shobana, but you don't look surprised. Everyone thought you guys would get married eventually. Everyone? When Shobana was born, your mother told Shobana's mother that their daughter would be her daughter-in-law. You should be surprised not us. Why the sudden plan to work in Canada? It's a great opportunity, mom. Only I got selected from my team. I'd be getting a raise in the salary too. Do you think you could stay alone? Come on, it's not a big deal. You know, six months ago I met a girl named An us ha. She rejected me! I was low for a few days, then moved on. Then, when we went to the village. Yes. Over there I liked a girl. Damn you! I liked her, but nothing worked out. I was low for a few days and moved on. Now when Shobana rejected... It's hurting like hell. I believed the previous two were love failures. Only now do I truly realize what a love failure feels like. I can't see my life without her in it. Did you feel that she's the, One? You realized it on your own, right? - Yes. - Let her realize too. Give her space. How can we send an unmarried girl abroad? Not necessary that women have to get married. Let her do what she wants. What? Now you're taking her side? Do you wish to keep her within the four walls? Only if she travels, she'll learn about the world. I got out of prison to kill you! Thiru! Thiru stop! Brother, please don't! Hey, don't harm him. Please don't do it. Let him go! Let go, damn it! Brother, please don't do it. Hey, let go of him. Thiru, you leave! Please I beg of you. - Thiru... Thiru... - Get lost! I only need your father. Thiru, you go! Please spare him. I said, you leave! Thiru... Thiru, you leave. I'll handle him. Hey! Hey, let go! Thiru! Hey, let go of him. Let go of my leg. Hey, let go of him! Let go of him! Hey! Hey! First, I'm going to kill you! Thiru, you leave! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Thiru! - Brother... Brother... - Let go! Thiru, run away. You don't listen! Hey! Let go... Hey! Let go! Thiru... Thiru! Thiru, you leave. Thiru... Thiru, you leave! Hey! Hey, Thiru! Hey! Hey, Thiru! Thiru, you leave! I said go. Go! Don't indulge; Leave! A few characters come into our lives unexpectedly. Also, I mentioned that they might do good for us in the future. When it came to saving my father, I fought like an animal. I understood that I would give up my life to save him. Shobana! Shobana! He will be fine. Don't worry! Don't cry. How was my fight? Even in college, I didn't see you fight like this. But now I witnessed it! I'm your son! I got admitted to the hospital for a few days. My father took care of me. But Shobana never came to see me. Neither anyone spoke to me about her. I shouldn't have proposed to her. As a friend, her anger is plausible. Please iron my uniform. I need to go to work tomorrow. What's the hurry? The Doctor has asked you to take rest. You can start work later. One of us has to work. You iron my uniform. Hey, Shobana... What about Shobana? Don't say anything. My head is already pounding. Listen, tomorrow she is... I said let go! Why are you yelling? Fine, you'll understand eventually. It's a scooter for crying out loud! Can't you ride a bike like a man! Pack everything in that bag. Are you planning to shop until the last minute? Did you pack everything I asked for? How do I pack this? 'Try and adjust, dad.' Thiru has returned from the hospital. Did you go and see him? Where is Thiru? I heard he got discharged. He has gone to work. Is he aware that I'm going abroad? As he was in that situation, I could not tell him. You do one thing. Call and meet Thiru. Don't involve me. Hello! Do you even know what's happening around you? What is it? Fine! How are you now? 'I'm fine.' Why did you rush back to work? 'You see...' What are you doing out here? Get out! Get lost! I'm okay. One of us has to go to work. I'm leaving for Canada tonight. Did anyone inform you? No one said anything. For how many days? I'm going there to work. I'm going to work there for two years. - Say something! - Fine, go... Go safe! Hello? My flight is at 03:00 a.m. I should be at the airport by 10:00 p.m. I'll leave home by 09:00 p.m. Okay, you wait outside the airport. I'll come and meet you. Okay. Krishna, did you book a cab? It's already here. I hope there's no traffic. If she leaves now, she will be on time. Come downstairs. Has Shobana left? Yes she did. You're being over dramatic. No one asked you to be the breadwinner. You better get married to your girlfriend soon. - Don't wait for me. - Get lost! Enjoy to the fullest. There are many places to visit in Canada. - Okay? - Sure, dad! Listen, please take care of your health. Eat on time. - Bye-bye. - Bye! Please take care of yourself. You too take care. Bye uncle. Did you speak to Thiru? He will meet me at the airport. I concur you won't take the flight. No, uncle. I will take the flight. Let's see! - Hello! - '-Shoba!' Tell me, mom. 'Have you reached airport?' I just reached. 'Has Thiru arrived?' He'll be here soon. Hey, stop the bike. Sir! Sir! Sir! - Park the bike. - Sir! Sir! Sir! Shobana, we have to go now. There's a long queue. Can we please move now? Five minutes I'm coming. No, no. We can't wait. We have to go now! Where's the helmet? Sir, it's an emergency. Please sir! You'll end up in an emergency if you ride without a helmet. A friend is leaving abroad. I have to go to the airport. Sir, please hand me the key. Hello, tell me. Sir, please hand me the key. Sir... I'll be there in half an hour. 'Hello!' I'm on my way. I booked a cab. I'll be there in ten minutes. Unfortunately, I can't step outside. Trust me, and I'll be there soon. The cab is almost here. Even if I want to, I can't step out. I have to go! "When I bear' 'unbearable weight" "You are the pillar' 'supporting me" "Let anyone come and go" "But you please' 'do not leave me" "Do not leave me" You're getting late for college. Hurry up! Fine, I'm leaving. Thiru, come in. Have some coffee. Shobana... She left abroad last night. Yeah she did! Without her, the house seems empty. He's feeling low because Shobana left abroad. They are childhood friends, right. What is it? You're the biggest fool. You can't grasp what's in front of your eyes. Take a look. Valentines day card. Greetings card. Mix tapes etc. She made everything just for you. When did you fall in love with Shobana? Do you know she's been in love with you since 6th grade? But she never expressed it. Because you never saw her in that way. I pushed her to propose to you. But you were behind other girls. Moreover, you ask her for suggestions. How do you expect her to propose to you? Listen... I never realized it. Later, I proposed to her. Yeah, right. You'll check out two girls in six months. After you get rejected by them, you'll propose to Shobana. What would she think? She must think she's a rebound. She might think to you, and she's just another option. What's the assurance? Your love and hers are not the same. I tried reasoning with her. I asked her to get married to a nice guy and to forget you. She never listened to me. Do you think she didn't have any options? Get lost! She's gone abroad. You stay put! 'You're a sweetheart!' Sweetheart! Do you want me to leave you alone? Yes. You leave. I'll see you tomorrow. 'I need to speak to her.' I... I will wait over there. ONE MONTH LATER Why are you crying? I shouldn't have come to Canada. I don't like it here. Don't cry. It's a good job. To hell with the job! It feels empty out here. It's a matter of two years! Is that you how you feel? You must be having fun without me. 'What else would I do?' 'You left, and I' 'have to accept it.' 'Going abroad was' 'your decision not mine.' Shall I come back? You don't have to come back. It's enough if you turn around. You have done a lot for me. But I never did anything for you. You took good care of me. But I never bothered to reciprocate. Your job. Your well-being. Your happiness. Your woes. Your love life. I never bothered to ask about anything. I heard husband and wife slowly drift apart after marriage. But I never understood that we were husband and wife all along. I took you for granted. I realized it only after you went away. It's only fair that I come here for you. You don't have to do anything. Hereafter I'll take care of you. Okay, let's go! Let's stay like this for a while. Okay. 'My beloved Tamizh folks.' 'My name is, Pazham.' 'Thiruchitrambalam!' 'Grandfather of Junior Pazham.' 'What age and experience teach' 'you are oblivious to youth.' 'Like you people, even I know that' 'Thiru and Shobana should get married.' 'But these two' 'morons didn't know.' 'A colossal drama for her' 'to move to another floor.' "What else do I need?" "You are enough for me" "When I bear' 'unbearable weight" - Over here. - I'm coming. "You are the pillar' 'supporting me" Hey! Your exam results are out. What happened? Fail! Don't be upset. No matter how many attempts it takes, I'll clear them. Okay. Until then? Look, I booked tickets for 09:30 p.m. Suppose you don't come by 08:30 p.m. I won't take you to the movie. Even now, you won't pick up and drop me at work? Late deliveries attract problems like refunds. He can't clear his exams. - But talks too much! - Hey! We are married now! - I love you! - Love you!
