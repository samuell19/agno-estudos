What about the maintenance team? Dokgowol Lunar Shield Project Intermediate Mechanic it's what you see I was thinking of rejecting the Gwanghangung space station , but Eventually, he joined the maintenance team of the 'Moon Shield Project'. Top secret, moon shield plan What is the moon shield plan to prevent asteroids from reaching Earth It's an operation that uses the moon as a shield. Because the asteroid collision has become a reality It was originally an asteroid orbiting Mars. After orbiting Mars for a long time , I must have felt boredom So I went off track It is said that after 8 years, it will rush into the arms of the earth. The deorbited asteroid was named Pi (π). Yes The circumference rate is what hits the earth In the end, mankind was ruined by mathematics. The news of the end heated up the world in an instant PUBG Pro League PEL sounds the final gunshot Don't miss the end of the world egg drop Wonder Park Apartment latest news Wonder Park is demolishing a residential-commercial complex. We are building evacuation apartments on the 18th floor underground. When an asteroid collides with Earth Will the handsome one die first? Professor Doo Hyo-woo, please tell me the correct answer. all die to prevent the extinction of mankind The United Nations convened a meeting in Geneva unanimously adopted the proposal of the Chinese representative Instead of waiting to die, he chose to attack. low gravity gravity operation The moon shield plan has a total of four stages. Level 1 The entire Earth joins forces to expand the existing lunar base Step 2 Use lunar helium 3 to create a new weapon, the Space Hammer. Step 3 Fire the Uchu Hammer to shoot down the Pi Step 4 Save the Earth by absorbing planetary fragments with the moon's gravity took 8 full years We succeeded in launching the Space Hammer The greatest problem of mankind will soon be solved 5 space hammers enter interception orbit As a member of the Lunar Shield Project, we have solved humanity's challenges. I need to do my homework in my life Maramseong, Commander of the Asia Branch of the Lunar Shield Project Ramseong, it's been 8 years since I first saw you Opportunities to express my feelings rarely come if you like me too here take these two guys WARNING, AIRLOCK OPEN WARNING, AIRLOCK OPEN have a good look hey There, maintenance team. Come on. hurry I am... take a picture hurry up It's expensive, don't drop it Careful let's all get ready ruler three - two - warning one warning what are you doing? which department? jeon... any department Let's not relax until the last moment contact the maintenance team The maintenance team rides on our FR001 when withdrawing it's the same spaceship same spaceship Would you rather write a letter? Jupiter, Commander Lunar Shield Project Engineers, due to the influence of the solar wind. 5 space hammers went off course Some of the fragments that did not enter the orbit will collide with the moon The base is also within the collision radius. how much time is left? 27 minutes and 38 seconds. 37 seconds 36 seconds notify all departments go straight to the launchpad Activate the emergency evacuation process All troops must withdraw as quickly as possible. warning, evacuation warning, evacuation warning I thought I had enough courage When I meet you I can't open my mouth warning so write a letter like this By the time you see this letter I 'll be sitting in the back seat for the best view if you like look at me and smile If that's too strange I tap your helmet three times with my left hand I'll take it as a good thing MG6630 program is ready What about the withdrawal situation?

Right, you too? huh sunken area ahead let's go power was withdrawn 31 seconds until the pie shard and the moon collided We must withdraw too. count down ready to launch launch what if i just go I haven't ridden yet Missiles are in the same place fell support no Warning, low oxygen Warning, low oxygen Warning, low oxygen Connecting an emergency call I have no conscience You don't have to treat me like a normal person Still, in this situation Knock on the door, take off your headphones and say to depart call connection hello I'm in trouble left me alone on the moon yes All 299 people withdrew. He cleaned everything up and left me alone. my location? The fourth pit to the right of the base exit. I'm alone so I'll look great yellow river water marni my heart breaks If only I knew that the Yellow River would dry up I wouldn't have let go of the railroad If the commander knew he was leaving moon man I wouldn't have written a love letter This is the UNMS Lunar Shield Base Respond when you hear This is the UNMS Lunar Shield Base Respond when you hear Six days have passed since the lunar shield plan failed. In the meantime , I tried to contact the earth by mobilizing all channels, but There was only one good news and three bad news left. the good news is that I am alive One small step was a giant leap for mankind. the bad news is The moon shield plan failed and Earth was destroyed. that only I am still alive This is the UNMS Lunar Shield Base The survival system in the base was well equipped. There are 114 days left of food for 300 people. if i stay alone enough to die Even if I eat full I guess the whole world is full 'Will you cry' 'The crane flies' 'beauty is forever' 'Smiles even in Gucheon' it's so sudden spirits in the sky here for you I wish you all the best Dear Maramseong!

Dokgowol can't connect? Team 2 is still trying. The communication equipment connected to the moon is completely broken. Only the module that sends images from the moon is alive Wirassa Lunar Shield Initiative Observer I can't do anything but watch All available resources are being used In two years , I will connect with Dokgowol. Earth's science and technology has completely regressed Even if it is connected There's no way to save that man Don't lose your strength over useless things who is useless? Son Kwang-yang Moon Shield Project Asia Bureau Chief wake up branch manager Is it my negligence that Dokgowol fell out? I will accept any punishment give me a chance to make up for my mistakes It's an order from above. After 30 days, Dokgowol spends time on the moon. Broadcast live all over the world Analyzing continental plate fault regions around the world while colliding with meteorites The Americas and the African continent were cut off The tidal wave that occurred at the time 30% of the land is submerged in the sea Inland cities covered in volcanic ash The concentration of harmful gases on the surface far exceeds the standard it's a very serious situation brother When will the sun rise again? Even sprouts die without sunlight. grapes, come here look at this the sun is out I know it's serious What does that have to do with the live broadcast of Dokgowol ? you're right I'd rather focus on rebuilding than the physical environment I am more concerned about the psychological state of the survivors. shelter The human activity space has been moved underground, Diseases increased due to poor living conditions Emergency food is only available for basic survival. The number of patients with depression increased If this condition persists Everyone will lose their will emergency food Relief is enough, don't push come one by one 2 servings, I came instead Brother, I can't live because of the constant power outage Let's eat quickly and go up to help. Even if I go, I'll just get in the way Why are you in the way? My brother is the best technician in our factory. The machine handles everything well. with this hand? Even if I hadn't saved you back then, it wouldn't have been like this Survivors think of Dokgowol as a hero If you take it as an example I don't know if I'll get the will to live Seeing what Dokgowol is doing, it seems impossible. I need to do image making again? Did I say no to this subway station ? should be deeper What are you doing? you are a celebrity image management image management? What image management is the world ruined ? Are you insane? I used to be a popular celebrity too it's nothing anymore Even now you are a popular celebrity I got a job in carriage number 2 It's the fan club grandma's birthday still there is someone who likes me Says you're a fan of the bald guy from Kung Fu Hustle go away speed is good Dokgowol's voice is dubbed Because there is no sound from the moon it's better Image making using dubbing After all, young people are different Commander Ma, I will give you my place soon. I will decline that This is the Lunar Shield Initiative Asia Command Center This is the Lunar Shield Initiative Asia Command Center Receive permission from the United Nations and inform the world we found a survivor on the moon On the day of the evacuation of the lunar base, a meteorite fell on the base I was forced to leave early. in that desperate moment He gave up the remaining seat to a colleague. I was walking in front of the launch pad and was hit by a falling meteorite I thought that colleague was sacrificed until now Contrary to expectations, he was alive And so far I've been alone disaster broadcast This survivor is Dokgowol, maintenance team of the Lunar Shield Project. Name: Dokgowol Affiliation: UNMS China Branch In 30 days, Dokgowol's daily life will be broadcast live. Looking at him, I sorted out my dizzy mind I hope you find your way to the future Wait What if people don't believe it? I have to convince that's too hard who believes who said no 196 days after major collision Maramseong Now that I've been with you, there's no time left now to you I want to go All this time , I didn't even bother to starve to death. It collapsed in three days My stomach almost exploded and I died I went outside and tried to take my helmet off You won't recognize me if I disappear without a form It's not easy to die Sleepy Syrup Maramseong Did you just give me a hint? I'll go to the warehouse No signal Found the cause of the malfunction, 2 teams are repairing it I get it. over takes 3 minutes 3 minutes before live broadcast 3 teams, 180 seconds left What's wrong? The signal has been lost and is being repaired It's sent all over the world, so make no mistake yes Are you still a voice actor? came He is the only voice actor left in China. The equipment is very old. I understand script Don't you have a copy? are you okay Adlib specialist signal restored 30 seconds left You know what to do? I'm talking to the screen 15 seconds left Were you very hungry? are you okay 'Cause it's enough for both of us It starts as soon as Dokgo Moon comes out I only say words that give me courage and strength trust only me nice to meet you but i have someone i like three two - One - let's start no What a wonderful day What a wonderful day What a wonderful day What a wonderful day What a wonderful day don't you knit? It's nonsense, the kangaroo is talking What are you talking about? I played separately from the screen i know go away what is a kangaroo? As a result of checking, the scientific research team left one behind. They are greedy and wild, so they are called bully kangaroos. what's the voice actor again? I checked and I was fooled He's the guy who dubbed comics on the Internet. It is called Horosa because it has a lot of appetite and a strong desire to show off . You didn't even know that kangaroos would come out. why is that my fault? but as an apology let me sing a song 'It's all my fault' it's all my fault it's really too much and among many animals Leave only the fiercest kangaroos? It was kind of aggressive well, it doesn't matter I just need to take my medicine Narration instead of dubbing ? If you don't like it, let the survivors know. Raised a kangaroo we say just go to the narration Occupying the warehouse... against the kangaroos Dok-go-wol holds an iron shovel without mercy I'm passing You can't attack a sleeping kangaroo Dokgowol is a good person Sleepy Syrup use it as a cane Getting old will help Maramseong I think I will follow you sooner or later Killed by him Better to die It's more painful because it's just enough that you won't die I can't I have to show you I will show you the power of mankind Will you quietly whisper They say they want to hear the stars in the sky the fantasy you gave me really amazing Dokgowol uses the famous beauty world Sleepy Syrup Don't ask how high the sun is I'll tell you my truth What are you going to do? Don't ask how many stars I'll tell you more What are you doing? Are you used to it? It was Dokgo Moon... Look at the car scratches I fly away in an instant really fast I'm so angry I'll be back come back I'm still a weird guy With a strange voice actor Dokgowol became a comedian it's all my fault Commander I don't agree with the Commander's words this time. Why is this the Commander's fault? It was Horosa who made our plan a laughing stock . As someone close to Horosa To evaluate objectively i'm still here And it's not all my fault The man on the moon is also a problem let's go listen to the song 'A problem caused by the moon' get out go and blow horosana Dokgowol has changed I made a machine gun with a 3D printer The only thing stopping me is death today I will smile in Gucheon Make me smile in Gucheon Kangaroo - Dokgowol don't let go Now I have a proper picture wrong don't follow me Dear Maramseong - Yes - Yes get rid of your legs right now Where do you hear the ukulele sound? It must be Horosa. Horosa stop blowing stop stop calling Commander an unexpected situation Dokgowol is hurt I can't stand It's like I can't even breathe Dokgo Will, here is UNMS Answer me if wrong open all channels All right Increased firing signal to maximum doggowol doggowol Respond when you hear doggowol This is the shield base Who just called? voice transmission system hello bad signal Yes or no, just answer You Are you the Moon Shield Planning Team? everyone Are you still alive? did you think of me? Will Dok-go-wol hear our voices ? probably not I haven't fixed the comms yet doesn't make sense scientifically There are many things that cannot be explained by science. mother let's not fight I'll take you home high five 224 days after major collision My name is Dokgowol ID P03008 Respond when you hear My name is Dokgo Will ID P03008 Respond when you hear My name is Dokgowol ID P03008 gangster stop eating now Stop what everyone is doing I have something to say our new home It was packed up I'm not reconciled It's like having an assortment as the head of this house There are questions why after that day Can't connect to Earth? tell me what do you want It's already great that you made that much noise. yes i think so It's amazing what you've endured so far then coming to pick me up go away I can't wait for your sister-in-law to go back we have to do it on our own from 1969 Apollo spacecraft set out to explore the moon one after another But in 1974 As Apollo 18 is about to depart for the moon Plans suddenly come to a halt And with the implementation of the Lunar Shield Plan The relevant files were finally released. Apollo 18 wasn't canceled Got in trouble after landing on the moon So Apollo 18 is still at the landing site Dokgowol started to move properly We forgot Apollo 18 too. If number 18 works normally Dokgowol aboard Apollo 18 You can go to a space station in lunar orbit From there, you can take a survival capsule and return to Earth. good news I got in touch with a GSA survival expert. You can use the lunar probe. The Lunar Explorer is under the ruins of the Collins meteorite. It can be controlled by emergency communications equipment. Then you will be able to communicate with Dokgowol. When Dokgowol safely returns to Earth Survivors here will be encouraged too Then we 'll do our part - Is it possible? - it's possible then let's do it failure rate 68% Americans did The Apollo program then It was like driving a washing machine across the Pacific Ocean. This washing machine has a lot to fix But in this matter I'm not the one to fall fall down fall down caution caution Dokgowol is building a raft to return home I saw Dokgowol wandering on the moon Wandering on the moon? A movie starring Oh Kyung, the emperor of the screen who suddenly disappeared 'Salpharang 2' comes to mind Moon Rover Connecting Commander have some water I've been chilling for a while look still hot It's so smooth Aren't you a mechanic? Correction is too severe An airship power engineer? But why did you go to the maintenance team? 282 days after the big collision , there is a problem Apollo's engines are all junk Loading weight is only 10kg Even if you ride alone, the load is exceeded What good could not be? if you can't point Gotta go with plan B We've been together so long, we're like family There are always variables in life Plan B is to abandon you instead i I will lose weight up to 10kg What's the situation like? if i don't abandon you throw away someone - Garbage - Garbage Chongru, why don't you believe me? You went to get some water to drink If I was going to throw it away, I threw it far away Mendeleev's Grand Canyon A space odyssey monument Gagarin Basin Or Manho Crater ten thousand? In the Ming Dynasty , there was a man named Man-Ho. I sat in a chair full of fireworks to go to space I have a chair, so all I need is firecrackers The strongest firecrackers in the world are on the moon The prototype of the space hammer is here Humanity's first lunar base Lake of Patience Science Base Excuse me. Are you done reviewing? What to say to the viewers ? Why are you doing this? Dokgowol found a way to return Once Dokgowol departs, he cannot return to the base. you're crazy I guess I'm really starting Dokgowol, what are you thinking? Commander, you think go away come out tell me how many It's too dangerous this time, it's even more dangerous if I go with you come out what are those eyes? It's no use threatening I say that I can't even beat you to death Are you really going to kill me? Should I use my fist? I have to tell you I see your will and take you away theoretically The space hammer engine Enough to replace the engine of Apollo 18 But moving the space hammer to the lunar shield base is absolutely impossible The lunar rover runs on solar energy. One hundred lunar days is 14 terrestrial days. Even if you run continuously for 14 days The operating range of the lunar rover is only 6,500 km. From the Moon Shield Base to the Lake of Endurance Over 8,000km round trip. Dokgowol is waiting for the sun to rise Since the lunar rover is powered by solar energy, We must return to base before the sun sets. What we calculated it's impossible Maybe Our live broadcast soon it will end Might have other plans Lake of Patience is to the east of the Lunar Shield base. If you see the milestone is WG21, it's west of the base. Dokgowol is going in the opposite direction to the Lake of Endurance. This is an impossible mission if this is Earth. but this is the moon Lunar Shield Base - Lake of Endurance floated I didn't misunderstand the direction You call this a contrarian - This is it - This is it - It's my plan. - It's Dokgowol's plan. The moon rotates at 16.6 km/h The speed at which the sun moves across the surface of the moon That's 16.6 km/h If you keep running after the sun Increased low Earth days from 14 to 41 I thought this plan was impossible It was because the days were short If I increase the daytime, this plan will also be possible Running more than 20 hours every day circling the moon Can carry a space hammer - You can complete the mission - You can complete the mission hold on tight, bully Lunar Shield Base if it goes according to plan We have to drive 31 days with only 4 hours of rest each day. Driving distance is 11,920km Reach the Lake of Endurance Lake of Patience After loading the space hammer, I ran again for ten days We must return to base before sunset moon shield base departed Dokgowol has departed It's still day when the sun doesn't go down Watching Dokgowol follow the sun Let's pray that the sun never sets When the sun goes down, the month of Dokgo ends. month round hour Lunar Exploration WG16 Copernicus Crater Sunset D-36 Manho Crater Sunset D-28 Crater Sunset D-20 are you awake? Scream Who in the universe would hear that ? month round hour Sunset on the west side of the sea of ​​waves D-12 destination is on the left you have arrived at your destination What is the purpose? goon, you've arrived arrived goon, you've arrived that we have arrived 5 years ago in an accident The Lake of Patience base is completely in ruins. Bullshit, don't touch me gangster This is the most powerful weapon in human history don't touch me carelessly gangster this nasty bastard Self-diagnosis completed Did you just touch the missile? this troublemaker you can't come out anymore Lake of Patience, Sunset D-10 After 31 days of hard work Dokgowol mounted a space hammer Only 1/4 of the lunar cycle is complete If Dokgowol can maintain its previous speed You can return to the Moon Shield base in ten days. It's so smoother than I thought I guess I must have been chosen come back girl come back girl where is my car I'm running out of time If Dokgowol goes back and saves the kangaroo We can't return to the Moon Shield Base before sunset . can't save Dokgowol faced a philosophical proposition Are you looking for whether or not to find a kangaroo No energy to return to base My only friend on the moon is a kangaroo Is it more important than your own life ? I won't even see a kangaroo soon If you don't find a kangaroo What about kangaroos? can't save but I'll go and save you I won't save Even if I die, don't resent me Why don't you follow me? if i go to save you we both die you die, i die you die, i die If you die, you die. go back Dokgowol is back gangster I'm coming The moment I turned, it came into my heart That's how you're a real man there is such a person On the outside, it seems normal and there is nothing accomplished. when the important moment comes A person who stands up and goes against the times Dokgowol is such a person. fool Webb Crater Sunset D-8 stop I can stop Okay, let's get dressed You can't die here I prefer to be beaten ouch Commander No matter how much you count it's over don't give up Dokgowol won't give up Should we give up? From a scientific point of view, it is dead. i don't believe in science How about a lunar exploration dog? I tried my best, but I still can't come out. The shovel is too small The lunar rover has an isotope battery With that, the Moon Rover can operate at the lowest power possible. If the moon exploration dog and Dokgowol meet Dokgowol can also return to the base From now on, watch the lunar rover screen for 24 hours. Figure out the route of Dokgowol with the milestones on the screen Dokgowol and the lunar exploration dog will meet The coordinates are 53.3 degrees east longitude and 2.5 degrees north latitude. Entered the Northeast of the Sea of ​​Plenty 142 hours left until sunset Dokgowol couldn't sleep and drove the lunar car. It's already been 53 hours switch to built-in battery I have power reserve, so I can last 5 more hours opportunity will come The moon explorer has arrived I'll go right away and support Dokgowol. low power mode Because Dokgowol started low power mode It is difficult to calculate the exact location But if you go all the way down this route It's the shortest distance to the base low temperature warning low temperature warning Room Temperature -20 Low Temperature Warning Room Temperature -40 Low Temperature Warning hold on low temperature warning low battery 55km I just need to go a little further I have good news and bad news the good news is That there couldn't be more bad news the bad news is There can be no more good news 55km left A spacesuit can only last 5 hours outdoors. It is impossible to travel 55 km on the moon in 5 hours. Where is the lunar rover located? 5km left There is a canyon 1km ahead then i have to go back late Let's cross the canyon using low gravity I'll do it Dok-go-wol believes in us and is resting lunar rover show me what about my dog? When I was young, adults said that When people die, they become stars in the sky. i don't want to be a star when you become a star You're too far away from the person you want to see I had a dream a dream far away freely I drifted like the wind Looking back beautiful starlight the place I most want to go next to you way home I couldn't imagine Take me to her. Now I heard later Ram Seong treats stray dogs and stray cats I rode the wind and brought you up It turned into leaves , so I tried to ask Will it become a shooting star and reap an abandoned human like me? I want to fall in your mind look What are you trying to do? kangaroo pulls A well-trained kangaroo You can run more than 30 km/h on the moon . gangster There is no time keep in mind speed is the best gangster Cancel what you just said safety first a miracle happened Dokgowol is a miracle I knew it wouldn't end like this gangster let's go Dokgo Moon flies Dokgowol's live broadcast gave hope to mankind There's positive chemistry going on between the survivors. So this year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded to Dok Go-Wol. A lot of fine dust has also disappeared. Communication facilities are also completed. If there are no problems After three months , you will be able to communicate with Dokgowol. good news I will report to the superior According to the observations of the local meteorological office Climate is recovering sooner than expected Currently , there are 45 million tons of fine dust in the atmosphere, Asia and Europe are connected to the atmospheric circulation There is a clear decline The air quality at night has also improved significantly. tell everyone There will never be a blackout in the future Only good things will happen The 8th level technician is back I won't lose to fate, hurry up and open the door The 8th grade technician is back Brother, how did you get struck by lightning? stop Is there electricity? came in Now that my brother is gone, there won't be a power outage. don't know that I couldn't even go up older brother be sure to come back I'll definitely go back 516 days after major collision gangster I have another problem To combine the things of the two eras It's not usually hard hard is hard I need to eat Does worrying make a difference? done connected gangster My name is Dokgowol ID PO3008 Respond when you hear My name is Dokgowol ID PO3008 Respond when you hear My name is Dokgowol ID PO3008 Respond when you hear How long will it take for communication to be restored ? at least one month We need to connect with Dokgowol as soon as possible. Maramseong way home I memorized your favorite song too I thought the day would come when I would call you it must be impossible You know what? I was always alone I think I know now what is the meaning of our life When you come home from work The one who lights up and waits Someone to pour a drink with when you're tired when you're in a slump The person to hug is the meaning of our lives The past two years I've lived really hard I want to go back to you I wanted to go back to you but now There's no reason to live anymore - Coordinate location. - Yes. it's not your fault it was fun so far high five I'm with him now I am Maramseong, Commander of the Lunar Shield Project. I have something to tell you you are like me You must have watched the hero Dokgowol. But I have a confession to make Dokgowol is not a hero The man was accidentally left on the moon I'm a normal person last year I tried to package him as a hero somehow when i see who is so behind I thought I couldn't give you hope last human in the universe but i was wrong who is so behind enduring to the end You shined a light on us in despair showed me hope Warning, low oxygen We know he's circumnavigating the moon I watched you save a kangaroo I saw you build a spaceship to come home Even when I see you enduring alone I couldn't fathom how lonely I must be Dokgowol is tired someone needs help that someone We should be the ones who watched Dokgowol only good things will happen this moment Let's light up the earth Let's shine a light on Dokgowol who is trapped in darkness light is Dokgowol is hopeful we are It is the light of Dokgo Moon turn on the light Let's tell Dokgowol doggowol you are not alone you are not a person why do you curse 613 days after major collision doggowol This is UNMS Can you see the screen we sent you ? Dokgowol, are you okay? say something You don't know Dokgowol hyungnim ? Over the past year, Hyung-nim's appearance was broadcast live 24 hours a day. I narrated Didn't miss a moment stop talking bullshit Dokgowol, now you're a world celebrity Do you know who is the most famous? It's a kangaroo hello doggowol hello Here's our plan It's up to us if Dokgowol returns. After contact with Earth Everyday goes by busily A return ship repair plan is also underway. But what I didn't expect The fact that I have to go with the space hammer Even though it is to balance the center of gravity it doesn't matter Because I can see Maram Castle every day I want nothing more but Create docking parts the whole world is watching me I just stare at her I mean, you shouldn't show it Maramseong The Earth and the Moon are 380,000 km apart. The feeling of being so close It's my first time Balance point performance test talk freely with you I want to lean on your shoulder i want to hold your hand want want more If the moon doesn't go, I'll go Gangloo, let's go to our earth I will never come back to this terrible place The vast universe is our earth before I had something to say tell me do you know Why did I join the maintenance team ? The engineer quota is full. What about the maintenance team? sorry I need to feed the cat Application Dokgowol this guy is fine it's me sorry are you okay I learned a lot thanks to joining the maintenance team. So fix the return line too When you hurriedly withdraw that day power was withdrawn 31 seconds until the pie shard and the moon collided I saw you through the rocket window We must withdraw too. count down But I couldn't wait because the situation was tense. sorry You didn't know me well back then, so I judged it rationally. will all By the way now If that happens again Will you still abandon me? yes I'm really cold so good good night good night here is zero one focus all Activate return vessel launch process gangster Finally, the day when Dokgowol returns Your face is shining Perhaps even now, Dokgowol's female fans You must be screaming like crazy, right? Dokgowill, face genius Dokgowol! start preparations for launch countdown begins - 4 - Normal control system - 3 - Communication normal - 2 - Electrical supply normal launch 10:30 The return ship has left the lunar surface speed normal altitude normal flight route top all data is ok Is it normal to shiver like this ? The state of the gang is also strange. 10:37 Return ship entered lunar orbit acceleration normal normal flight condition flight track top Return ship launch successful that's really great After 943 days alone on the moon Dokgowol returns to Earth approaching lunar orbit turn off the main engine 10:45 Return ship approaches Gwanghangung all is fine zero one Approaching Gwanghangung Switch to auto-docking system Please switch zero one entered the space station Has confirmed Where is the commander? zero one This meteorite is also a pie At that time, the pie was disassembled and split in two. The largest piece of debris fell to Earth The remaining fragments were incorporated into lunar orbit. Some floated between the Earth and the Moon However, a large piece remained among the fragments. The United Nations called it Pi Plus. Did you check the trajectory? It recently collided with another meteorite and changed its trajectory. rushing towards the earth at high speed There's only one person who can save us The only space hammer is on Dokgowol's return ship.
