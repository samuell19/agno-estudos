-Taxi? -Where to? -45, Emil Racovita Street. -OK. Give me your bag. Can I ask a favor? I have to take some food to the kids. My wife left me three years ago. I'm all they have. -I'll start the meter afterwards. -OK. If it's not far. Just a couple of streets away. I didn't want to leave earlier, I'd lose my place in the line. How are you? Here. Go eat with your brothers. That's life. I went to Spain to work in construction and my wife hooked up with a pimp. Now they're both in jail. She begs me to forgive her. 'Course I'll forgive her. The Lord says we should turn the other cheek. We have to forgive. What? An accident? Let me get you the bag. Thank you. You haven't paid me. 35 lei. -I'll get your change. -No need. Thank you very much. God bless! Want to put the bag in the trunk? We don't have much time. Come with me to finish the formalities. I don't wake up till five PM. I don't fall asleep until around six AM. The phone woke me up at around 3:20. They said he's in the emergency room. I threw on a dressing gown and left. It was too late. Maybe I'm crazy, but... I thought he smiled when he heard my voice. A few minutes later he stopped breathing. I held his hand when... I'm going to the bathroom. Are you ready? In a minute. I'm not leaving this evening. I hope you don't mind if I stay another day. Andrei, this is your house too. Anyway, I'm working the nights. It's no problem at all. I thought I should ask. I'll leave you the keys. I won't be home this evening. Thanks, I owe you! Mr Dorneanu. -My condolences. -Mr prosecutor! What do you want, Rogoz? Can't you see I'm with somebody? Sorry. I wanted to tell you we caught Snake. You said to bring him to you. Congratulations. What's up, Snake? We meet again? In a hurry, or what? No hurry, Mr Prosecutor, sorry to bother you. Finish your business, I'll wait for you here. Thank you so much. You promised you'd be a good boy. Well, there's still the predumption of innocence. -What? -Predumption of innocence. -Yes, you're right. -Until proven guilty, I'm a good guy. That's right. Wait here. This way, Mr Dorneanu. -Rogoz... -I'll wait. Never mind... Can I take a look? Are you sure you want to see them? Here. Those injuries weren't caused by the fall down the stairs. They're too extensive. I don't want to speculate, but the fall could have resulted from a fight. Is there a list of suspects? You know the law. Anyone in that restaurant is a suspect. It's rather delicate. Most of them are lawyers, prosecutors, judges. Colleagues. We're making inquiries, but must tread lightly. The best-case scenario is that someone came in from outside... In the best-case scenario my father would be alive. You're right. But he isn't. I want to find the person responsible, not a fall guy. If there's a person responsible. The coroner's verdict isn't in. Sorry. I told you the conclusions I drew at first sight. But... the coroner's report will give us some answers. Are there any recordings from the restaurant? Surveillance cameras? Anything? Somebody else drew up the evidence report, but I can take a look, although I didn't see... No mention here. I can talk to the prosecutor, though... Mr. Dorneanu, what surveillance cameras in that place? Sorry, I have to take this. Tell me quickly. What do you mean he got an F? After all that tutoring? What's he doing, crying? If he deserved a B why did he get an F? -Good afternoon. -Hello! -A table for one? -Sorry? A table for one, or are you waiting for someone? -For one, please. -This way. -A coffee. -That's all? OK. -Need the menu? -No, thank you. The toilet? Yes. Straight on and down the stairs. Are you hurt? No. Was it your shift yesterday? -Yes, why? -What about two days ago? -Listen, I don't want any trouble. -I just want to ask you something! Yes, mum. The battery died. I don't want everyone calling me. No, of course I didn't forget about you. How do you think it went? Like a funeral. I'll call you back later. I have to go. I love you. The difference is that I can sleep soundly at night. I've no reason to be scared. And the difference is... Let me bloody speak! The difference is that I'm hanging up. Like that! Fuck you and your fucking difference. Is this how I raised you, Andrei? To ignore your father's calls? I guess I can forget about you taking care of me when I'm old. I'll be in Bucharest on Wednesday. I'll take you to eat something proper for a change. Put it in your diary. I've a proposal for you. Business. I think you're right. The lawyer is more important than the judge. Hello. Mr Marascu? I'm Andrei Dorneanu, Toma's son. I've just got his phone and checked his call history. The last call he made was to you and... What? I see. To confirm he was coming to the restaurant after he'd said he wouldn't. Weren't you supposed to be at work? I didn't go. Thanks for bringing the car, I couldn't have done it. Are you hungry? No. Give me a cigarette. Why are you sitting in the dark? I'm wondering how it feels in the grave. Did you leave him some cigarettes? No. Maybe I should have. And some whiskey. And me naked. I miss him. I never had the chance to say anything important to him. I have the same feeling. That morning he had his regular check-up. He did it two-three times a year. He wasn't home when I got back, so I went to sleep, I was exhausted. I woke up with him inside me. I'll make an omelet. Want some? I'm going to bed. Morning. I'm leaving tonight. We even joked about it. People usually come to see me with a problem. He came preventively. It's nice to occasionally give a clean bill of health. I couldn't believe it when I heard. What's this? Mr Toma made a joke. He was always joking. He took the pen from my hand, and drew a tiny heart. He said that was where it hurt whenever I examined him. He was very nice. And what did you tell him? Honestly? That I'd diagnose "late-stage adolescence" if he kept messing around. What did he say? He said: "Not flirting with a woman like you would make me dead or blind." As he dressed, he told me he wanted to die quickly, so he wouldn't have time for regrets. Your father was a charming man, full of life. I was smiling for an hour after he left. Are you OK? Yes? Do you have something for a headache? Sure. Take this. -Thank you. -You're welcome. What about calls to the emergency services? Do they record them? I'm not sure, but I can ask someone. -Is there something wrong? -No. Can I keep this? We're not allowed to release documents, except to the patient. I'm so sorry. Do you want a copy? I wanted this one. Give it to me. These hands are made for playing the piano, doctor. What are you doing, Mr Toma? Are you judging me? Sit up! I'd judge you-- but would you serve the punishment? You'd send me to prison? What have I ever done to you? No, the judge chooses the sentence. I need to find a suitable one. You're perfectly healthy. But you only examined me from the waist up. -Hello. -Hello. I'm Andrei Dorneanu, the son of judge Toma Dorneanu. I knew the judge. It's all such so unfortunate. You can't imagine... Please sit down! So... -So, Mr.... -Cepoi. Mr Cepoi, I'm going to be straight with you. I know footage was recorded on the day of the "accident". You have two security cameras, one here and the other next to the men's toilet. I'd like to see the footage. Mitică, just coffee?! Bring some biscuits, something to eat! Well, you see, we don't have much space on those cameras. If you don't save the footage, it gets recorded over. And no one asked for the footage? No. I was surprised. That means you thought about it. Let's cut to the chase. How much will it cost for that footage? Everything between 12:00-15:00? Come on, Mr Andrei. What the hell! I'd give it to you if I had it. But I don't. I respected your father as if he were my... Mr Cepoi, do you want us to meet in Court? It won't be hard to close this restaurant down. I can see we're getting nowhere. Mr Andrei. Sit down. A blonde miss came that evening and took the footage. She was young. Said she was from God knows where. She threw around some acronyms I'd never heard of. She flashed an ID, small print, so I gave it to her. Then I started to wonder, but it was too late. She stormed in wearing high heels, smoking cigarettes, and I handed it over. You can do what you want to me, but I gave it to her. Mr Andrei, we make a very good Argentinian steak here. What do you say? On the house. Mitică! I thought I'd bring the last photos of your father alive for you to see. I took them at the dinner. I'm always taking photos. I've known you since you were little, but never noticed how much you look like him! -Can I have them? -Of course. No, you're wrong. No! -Ioana? -It hasn't started yet. You're leaving? I came to buy a ticket. This is Bubu. He's a real handful. Be good, honey. You just arrived? You're coming and I'm going. A twist of fate, I suppose. Where've you been? To a festival. It doesn't matter. How are you? Don't you want to get a coffee? Why's there cake all over my face? You're a messy eater! When I found out, I was at a film festival with Bubu. I take him everywhere. My aunt called. She always calls when something bad happens. "Toma died." "Toma died." I suddenly felt sick. And I dropped Bubu. We were in the park on the roundabout. He started screaming, but I couldn't get it together. I was completely numb. I started thinking about you and had to sit down. Yes. He's the last person you'd ever imagine dying. That's true. But when your heart gives out... His heart? Where did you hear that? It wasn't his heart. He fell down the stairs in a restaurant. What do you mean? Who the hell dies from falling down stairs? My father, I guess. Anyway... I don't want to think about it anymore. Me neither. How are you? I can't believe it's really you. And where did this cute kid appear from? He is cute, isn't he? It's an old story. From the start of university. I wanted to keep him, so I did. You know I'm not the marrying type. I know. From personal experience. If you wanted a kid, why didn't you call me? I didn't have your number. And Toma's house? Does it go to you? I don't know. I don't care. I'll never understand why we didn't end up growing old together. I made a film about your father. Or I started one. I tried to make a documentary about a judge. You made a film about my father? Just ten minutes of footage. Nothing edited. You made a film about my father and you're telling me after half an hour? You'd better ask some questions, right? Or I'll be talking to myself. Well, that's the idea with documentary films... So I look at the camera and start talking gibberish? Gibberish... You have to talk like they do in documentaries. OK. I'm Toma Dorneanu and for over 25 years I've been "judging" people. As if everybody is stupid and I'm the only smart one, telling them what's right and wrong. Kind of like God. But if the guy up there saw me, he'd probably throw a lightning-bolt. Being a judge is like... Where did you get that? I fell off my bike. Being a judge has nothing to do with right and wrong, but with the law. I often gave sentences I didn't agree with. My sense of morality isn't important. Nobody asks a judge what he thinks. People ask a judge what the law demands. -Aren't you hot in here? -Yeah, but there's nothing I can do. It was really hot. Yes. I don't know what else to say. Ask me questions. You can edit them out. I don't want to do it that way. Say whatever you'd like to get across. Must be hard being a director! What can I say? Half of the judges in this country should be in prison. You, too? No. Definitely not. But maybe a public beating wouldn't hurt. So you were involved in dodgy deals? Whose side are you on? No, I wasn't. Never. Though I had many chances. I could have made it, but I preferred to play it safe. Being smart means not thinking you're smarter than everyone else. If you only knew how many of my acquaintances are behind bars, Johnny? And if you want to know the truth... Fuck! The battery! It ran out. By the time I charged it, he left. You know how he was. What did he call you? Johnny. He made fun of me for being a tomboy. He called me John, Johnny, Johnny-boy. Toma. Yes, honey, but get away from the TV, you might get electrocuted. Let's play in your room! Are you leaving? Yes. Why didn't you go to law school after all? My father tutored you for half a year, didn't he? I just changed my mind. You changed your mind quite often that summer. Will you give me the film? There's nothing you can do with it, anyway. I'll make you a copy and send it to you in Bucharest. Ioana, for you he was a just a tutor. I'll make a copy and send it to you. Thanks. Why did he ask "where did you get that from?" What? My father asked you "where did you get that from?" I had a bruise over here. I fell off my bike. It was on the arm. You fell off your bike. What are you doing, sweetie? Which one do you want? Which one do you want, Andrei? This one or this one? It's not nice to speak with your back turned. -'Cause he can't see me? -Yes. Which car do you want? -This one? -This one. Here. I don't have time to play right now. I have a train to catch. Fine. -Say goodbye! -Bye! Won't you give him a kiss? Bye. Safe journey. Hello! Who is this? Dad? Didn't you leave? I'm leaving now. Want to come for a smoke? Close the door, Elena. Something wrong? Yes. My father died. Close the door. Not just your father. My husband died, too. I know. But you'll find another man. We need to take care of the inheritance. You sort it out. I don't want anything. Really? You were never interested in anything else? Tell me what the hell you want, and stop playing the victim. -I want to see the footage. -What footage? The one you took from the restaurant. You read too many detective novels, kid. Don't fucking "kid" me! You took that footage. I want to see it. Are you out of your mind? I brought you cigarettes and a beer. How are you doing, dad? What's up? Is the money spent? It is. I'm exaggerating. Two cinema tickets, two drinks, popcorn. If I'd got it from a supermarket, it'd be cheap. But they charge a fortune to put some ice and a straw in it. You get me? No way! You take her to the restaurant? You'd have to marry her, to make it worth the money. Wait a minute. I have to go. My son's calling. Hey, son. Yep, daddy's coming home now, I'm with the last client. OK. -See what... -Leave me here, please. Aren't you going to the train station? No, leave me here. You're killing me. I call you later. -Seven lei. -Thanks. Solid gold... €200. No thanks. I'm not interested. -€150. Solid gold. -I don't wear a watch. €100. Give it to a beautiful woman. €100. Solid gold. No more bets. 14 Red. Elena, you bring me luck. I always win when you're here. New dealer. When you decide to marry again, put me on the waiting list. Weren't you supposed to leave tonight? Tell me why my father is dead and I'll be gone. You're crazy. I'm not allowed to talk to anyone here. I want to see the footage. Good evening. Can I help you? This gentleman is looking for the bathroom. The bathroom is on your left. -That's him. -Are you looking for somebody? Yes. Elena Dorneanu. Sorry. You're not allowed to make contact with the staff. I'll show you the exit. I'm her brother. It's important. That's your problem. It's not allowed. I'll show you my ID. My name's Dorneanu. It's important. -Please, understand. -Come on. Just two minutes. I wouldn't be here if it weren't important. Please! I'm asking you! My father died. I have to let her know. Condolences, but you'll let her know after working hours. Just two minutes. Wait! Sorry, we're closed. How come? It was open this morning. They're stock-taking. Can I use the toilet, just two minutes? OK. But don't be long! Thanks. Short day at work? Tell me how you met my father. Why didn't you ask him? Honestly? I didn't think much of you then. I didn't think it was worth the effort. And why did you change your mind? How did you meet? In the casino? What do you really want, Andrei? Do you have a cigarette, bro? Thank you. Boss, can I use your phone? I used my father's key to get in. What happened? I'm tired. Can I sleep here tonight? Andrei, what's wrong with you? I'm tired. I can sleep in Bubu's room if you like. In Bubu's room? Come here. There you go. There you go. There you go. I know exactly how you feel. In moments like these... You have no idea how I feel. It doesn't matter anyway. Do you know... if my father had enemies? Did he mention anything? No. He didn't say a thing. What does it matter, anyway? You can't bring him back. I wonder what he'd have done in my place. You're not him. I noticed that myself. You've completely ruled out him falling down stairs? I'm not ruling out anything. But it would help if it were a little more believable. So I could move on. Those stairs aren't helpful at all. How long are you staying here in Cluj? I mean, you can stay as long as you want. When do you have to go back to Bucharest? I know what you were asking. I should have returned yesterday. Mum, I'm really hungry! Yes, sweetheart, right away. Who did you say his father was? A colleague from university. He left the country... He wanted me to go with him, but I don't want to live elsewhere. I didn't even tell him I was pregnant. He got a scholarship in the States. I should be going. Want to play with me? Are you ready? Don't you want to catch the train? Don't you want to catch the train? Yes, honey, he has to leave. -OK. -He has something to do. Why are you hurt? I fell. -Why? -He fell over, darling. -He didn't manage yet? -What? To catch the train. -He'll catch it today. -OK. Mummy will bring you breakfast. -Coming for a cigarette? -No. Some of us have to work. See you later. Hello, Mr Dorneanu. What happened? Nothing, I fell down the stairs. You fell down the stairs? This way. -Sorry, who is that? -Prosecutor Szekely. Beautiful, right? My father had a medical examination that very day. Don't you find it strange he had a heart attack on the same day? Everything seems strange when someone dies. All I know is the conclusion of the forensic report. And what's your conclusion? A swollen eye, a broken hand... They don't seem very consistent with a heart attack. My conclusion hardly matters. But if you want me to reopen the case, I will. But we might end up with the same conclusion. The restaurant had surveillance cameras. Why wasn't the footage seized? I'm glad you mentioned it, I almost forgot. It was seized. Our colleague Szekely, got hold of it. But she only put it in the report yesterday. She was on sick leave for two days. She has some health problems. Something about a lump in her breast. I'll call you back. We go out for a cigarette sometimes and she tells me stuff. She found a large lump in her right breast. It took two days for the biopsy... Sorry... Mr Dorneanu, I understand your grief. I'd probably behave the same in your shoes. But we're just doing our job, the best we can. That surveillance footage isn't much help to us. I mean... One of them wasn't even working and was left there to scare the staff. Only the one for the toilets was working. The footage shows clearly how Mr Dorneanu walks past. Nobody else passes until he was found on the steps. -Can I see the footage? -Of course, you're one of us. But not right now. As soon as the conclusions are made official, I'll give you the video myself. -Sorry. I have a train to catch. -Do you want me to call you a cab? No. I'd like to know why my father died. Can you help me with that? What are you doing here? Something happened? I didn't know what train you'd be on, so I came here right after you left. You've been here since last night? I wanted to let you know that I'll pack up and leave the house today. Everything he had is yours. Not legally. The inheritance... I'm not interested in that shit. I knew from the beginning... it wouldn't last. It was too good to last. I prepared myself for this moment every day of my life, but... It still caught me unprepared. Do you know how many of my acquaintances are behind bars, Johnny? -And if you want to know the truth... -Fuck! The battery! Is this how I raised you, Andrei? To ignore your father's calls? I guess I can forget about you taking care of me when I'm old. I'll be in Bucharest on Wednesday. I'll take you to eat something proper for a change. Put it in your diary. I've a proposal for you. Business. I think you're right. The lawyer is more important than the judge. And bring me some photos of your ladies, give a dirty old man something to look at. This answering machine is annoying, but your phone's off all the time. I hope you're with a girl! See you Wednesday. Bye. Subtitle translation by Andrei Neagu
