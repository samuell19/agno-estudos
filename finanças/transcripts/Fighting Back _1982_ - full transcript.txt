[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] [INDISTINCT MURMURING] Hi, baby, John. I am so sorry. Oh, God, it's all... [KISSES] I love you, baby. [CRYING] It's a lighter taste, yet not bland. Very reminiscent of the northern style of cooking, as opposed to the heavy-gas spicy style of the Southern land. Is that right?Yes, of all the country. You use sauce in your household, Mr. Donizetti? No need to answer that. Compliments of the Groaner Manufacturing Company. Here is some samples. You carry this, and it's going to move.I'll put that on your tab, Mr. Donati. [INDISTINCT SPORTS COMMENTARY] Sure, you want to think this over. Here's my card. Mr. D'Angelo, in case you decide... I got one word for you, son. Quality. Well, that's exactly the thing our product has is quality. I'll be hearing from you.All right. Yeah, I'm sure you will. God, somebody should tell that guy how bad business really is around here. Yeah, well, business is bad 'cause people like the Nardinis keep moving out. I'll tell you something, Frank. Running don't solve a thing. Come on, Danny. Walk your grandma home. Hey. Hey, whenever do I need a babysitter? Momma, don't start, huh? you know I don't want you walking home alone. I know how to take care of myself. JOHN: Will you get your jacket on? Come on.

Yeah, we checked that. Yeah?Car was stolen. What are you gonna do about it? I'm doing all I can do about it. Hey, look, we waited 45 minutes for the ambulance. That's 45 minutes! My mother waited on the floor for 45 minutes, Vince. So what the hell is that? You know what our problem is over here? You know what kind of shortage we got with police? I don't give a shit about your problems! This is my mother we're talking about here! You want to talk to him, Vince? John, believe me, look, there was a response as soon as the call came in.Son of a bitch. Look, we understand how you feel. We know what your problem is.You understand nothing. Now this is the reality of my life. My wife is on one floor and my mother is on the other! You tell me what I should think about the goddamn police department, huh. John, Vera is going to be all right. It looks like Harry Janelli is going to pull through. Thank God for that. Yeah, well, I'm gonna have to thank God for that. Because I sure as fuck can't thank the police department. Let's go. Yeah, where the fuck you been? Vacation? We gotta get out of here. There's just no question anymore.[SHUSHING] You'll wake her up. John. Listen to me. We have to move. Moving is out of the question. Nobody makes me move. Well, what are we gonna do? You tell me. I don't want to talk about it. Sons of bitches! It was more than just hit and run. My baby was killed, for Christ's sake. I know, John. What can I tell you? The guy made his bail. He was in and out in two hours. Well, that's wrong for Christ sakes! He knows all kinds of shit. Look, the guy's got a complaint file all to himself. I can't touch him. It's like trying to bust the mayor, for Christ's sakes. Sergeant said to me, "Morelli, what are you doing "wasting your time? Do your job. "Stop messing with the Mickey Mouse." Mickey Mouse? Does that look like Mickey Mouse out there? Look at those fuckers. They own the park. There's a guy who's pushing dope right now. Go on over there. If you can't handle him, you got two guys with a hot stereo over there. Get out that horse of yours and arrest 'em right now. I can't do it, John. It wouldn't stand up. What are you telling me? I'm chicken. Okay? I'll give you that. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] JOHN: It used to be such a beautiful park. Old Uncle Charlie. Boy. Take your life in your hands now if you walk through that park. Now, this... What's his name, huh? I don't remember him. Guy with the thing on. [OBJECTS CLATTERING] [YELPS] [GROANS] What's your problem? Goddamn it! Did you burn yourself? Let me see that. Don't touch me. Get away from me. I'm just trying to help you for Christ's sake.John. If you love me, how can you keep me here? What are you talking about?I don't understand it. I don't deserve to live this way. Your mother doesn't deserve to live this way. What's wrong with the way you live?Please listen to me. Please, just once. Listen to me, please. We have to move. Please. [SOBBING] Please! I love you, baby. I love you too. But you've got to get your priorities straight. If you don't get us out of here, I swear to God, I'm going to take Danny and I'm going to leave you. Please. You gotta give me time. Just give me time. Okay? [LISA SOBBING] [KISSES] Look at that. What? That's it. That's the son of a bitch. That's it. That's that son of a bitch that chased us and ran into us. I think you're right.Look at the fender on it. Look, I'll tell you what, I'm going to call the station, get some police over here. John, Don't go in there. John. [BAR MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, hey. John, let's get out of here. Come on. John? John. MAN: Get out of here! I said get out of here! Who out? Well, well, well. If it ain't Little Italy. Messing in other people's affairs again, huh? John! You know what they say about a man that can't control his woman? He can't control his bowels either. He shits in his pants. John! Drop that! [GUNSHOT] Get out of here! Get out here! All right. All right. Let go! Come on, man! Drop that gun, John!That son of a bitch, I'll kill him. Give me that gun! Give me the gun.Son of a bitch put Lisa in a hospital. That son of a bitch killed my baby!Calm down! John, you cannot go around shooting up bars! All right? Now we're going to call the police. [INDISTINCT] VINCE: What the hell you trying to do anyway? Get us both killed? What the... Jesus Christ! John, let him go! Son of a bitch! [WOMAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] John? John? Most of us work. How are we going to find time? I can't hear you, Frank. [WHISTLES] Hey, Frank wants to talk. Come on, let him talk. Quiet, will ya? John, I said most of us work. How are we going to find time? All right, we got to find the time. We got to figure out how to do it. Because families can't go out on the street no more. People is talking about moving on. What is that? What we've got to do is scare some respect into the punks. Hey, John, these guys don't scare that easy, man. We're not trained in that kind of stuff. MAN: Somebody mentioned before something about a citizen's arrest. I don't know anything about making a citizen's arrest, but I'm sure that there's some kind of legality involved. No, he's right. According to the law, you cannot take a suspect into the station. In making a citizen's arrest, you have to wait until an officer arrives on the scene. I guess that means I'll be standing around all the time waiting. [ALL EXCLAIM] Hey, come on.Excuse me... That's the point. These guys got more work than they can handle. So we get together a citizens group and help them out. That's what we're talking about, because they can't do it all. [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]This whole idea is ridiculous. At least it's about time they do something like this. Look what happened to poor Mrs. D'Angelo. It's a shame. It's a shame? It's appalling! I don't understand why any of us are still living here. What else are we gonna do? This is our home. Yes. And we're established here. Good night. JOHN: ...on the streets. I mean, other neighborhoods are doing it, why can't we? MAN: Excuse me, Vince, can we carry guns? VINCE: Well, half of you guys do carry guns. [MOUTHING]VINCE: Unlicensed. The fact is, if you're going to be exercising your constitutional rights by making a citizen's arrest, pointing a gun at that suspect's head would not be construed as self-defense. You know what I mean? It would fall into what they call a gray area. Well, I'm going to hold on to my gray area. [ALL LAUGH] Which I notice you're getting a little more up on these days. All right. A little bit. John.Hey, quiet down! Les wants to talk. What do you want to say, Les? John, I just want to say, um... I've got a lot of reasons for not getting involved in any of this, and I think you understand what I mean. But, uh, that cleaners... My father worked real hard for them. MAN: He's absolutely right. And the last time they got robbed, they roughed up Gene and, well, I just back you all the way. What do you want me to do? Hey, that's great. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. Vince and I, we grew up in that park across the street. How many of your kids go over there and play now? Huh? My kids don't go near that place. All of you got lives in this community here. All of you got lives here. Because it's your life I'm talking about here. MAN 1: What are you gonna do?MAN 2: I agree with that. I draw the line. Well, John, you convinced me, pal. I'm with you all the way. I don't know about these guys over here, but you got me. What are you talking about? What guys are you talking about? [ALL MURMURING] Hey, John, we got to do it right like you said, though. All right. Let's see a raise of hands, huh? Come on. Come on! Come on! Where? That's it, come on. Hey, Mr. Moresco is with us, both fists. Huh? [KISSES] [POWER TOOLS WHIRRING] MAN: Heads up! [KIDS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Here, here. Just watch it. [HAMMERING AND DRILLING] What about this section? Shouldn't it be smaller, Vince? I mean, that's the main problem area. It's a blow up, John.Yeah... It's only eight blocks up here, and about 12 down here. I'm going to lay out the other patrol areas in here.Okay. In here, we'll have radio contact with headquarters. MAN: I showed you how we do the compressions. Then we go back and do the airway, and everybody had a lot of fun. Now, who's going to do it? Who's gonna be the first guy to return the demonstration? [INDISTINCT OVERLAPPING CONVERSATION] MAN: I think I know this girl. You have an unconscious victim. I'm on the scene. What's the first thing you're gonna do?First thing I'm gonna do, I'm gonna deflate her, put her in my pocket, take her to the car, blow her up in the driveway. [ALL LAUGHING] What's the first thing you're gonna do?I'm gonna yell in her ears. Let me see you do it. Hey, lady, get up! Will you? Get up! Shake her shoulders a little bit. Not that... Not so hard, not so hard. You gotta shake...[INDISTINCT CHATTER] [ALL LAUGHING] I give her four breaths in her mouth. Yeah, it's good.All right? Four breaths. MAN: Ugh! that would kill anybody. [ALL LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER]MAN: I think she's alive, look! She's sticking her tongue in my mouth. [INDISTINCT CHATTER][ALL LAUGHING] Yeah, I swear to God, I love you, too. Hey, how's your arm? How are you? It looks pretty good. Will you hold that for a minute? What's this?That's a bottle. For what?Hit that thing, give it a name. You're kidding me![ALL CHEERING] I christen thee... [ALL CHEERING] [INDISTINCT OVERLAPPING CHATTER] [SING SONG VOICE] ♪ Nobody gets up! ♪ Nobody gets up! ♪ [SIREN WAILING] [SIGHING] Looks like a battering ram. It's a nice, quiet little sedan, Vince. Little Miley's driven by a little old lady. Too much, John.Half-price. I'm telling you, it's too much. Hey, John, what's Vince so pissed about? I don't know. He thinks you shouldn't drive around tanks or something, I guess. What does he expect? Hey, Morelli, come on back here. I want to give you a ride in my tank here. VINCE: Don't give me that. I'd say a girl scout. You've got an honest face. I'll give you good credit. I think it's time to introduce ourselves, gentlemen, to the community, leave a calling card, and I think the place to do it, is a bar.

He literally came here to pay us what he owes us. JOHN: I've come to ask your help. Shit! The man wants some help. Give it to him. What kind of help you want? Well, somebody hurt my mom at Janelli's drug store up in Lincoln Street, I thought you might just know who did it. [CHUCKLES] Hey, brothers! Anyone hurt his mama?

There are certain civil prerogatives. I'll tell you what? Keep your eye on him. If they break any laws, book 'em. All right. What do you want to do about our guys running around with him?

They used to drive around in cars, patrolling the neighborhood, and he started the North Ward Citizen's committee. They had self-defense classes, karate. One! Two! Three! Four! And here he is now. Just listen to him. This is really something. If the law cannot control it because the mayor will not make them, then it is time for us under the constitution to defend ourselves. to the limit!

[TIRES SCREECH][WOMAN SCREAMING] [CAR HONKING][INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [TIRES SCREECH] [TIRES SCREECH] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] You lost him, you dumb shit! Hey, motherfucker! You wanna come back here? Motherfucking shit! Hey, don't worry about it. Just a pimp car. MAN: It's pretty good. Exercising your constitutional rights, huh? [LAUGHS] Danny, get your coat on. John, what about Mrs... Carter's order? I'll be right there. LISA: What about the pasta? I gotta get the kid to school. What about opening up the store? We're opening right now. Go out. [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] Ah, this is crazy. JOHN: What are you doing, Giuseppe, what is this? I am here... We're here to... To thank you and to have some espresso coffee and to show you our support for what you do for us. This man, he gave us back our streets. [CROWD CHEERING] We love him. We love him. We love him. CROWD: We love you. We love you. [KISSES] Wait, wait. [SIREN WAILING] This...Don't worry about that. No, wait, wait. I got to make a speech, now. What do you got here? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Oh.God bless you! Viva l'Italia! [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] What's in there? A Cracker Jack. Huh?[LAUGHTER] That's beautiful. You put... [MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY] Look, how... Look. [CROWD CHEERING] One of my... gave him the flag. Hurray for... Hurray for John! [CROWD CHEERING] Well, you want some espresso, go on, back there. [ALL CLAMORING] There's a little Sambuca too. Go on, help yourself. Let's go. Let's go. That must have been a very special moment for you. Hey, you're on TV, aren't you? Channel Six, Sara Rogers. And I'd like you to join me for an interview on the Michael Taylor Show. Well, I don't know. John, I don't think so. We just opened the store, we have a lot of work to do. It won't take any time. JOHN: Well, how long? The crew's right here. We can go right outside. Right out here? Right out front. How long will it take? No time. Two or three questions. Oh, I see, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds pretty good. Yeah. Okay.Okay, I'll do that. Okay? John. Huh? I'm gonna go to the movies. What are you talking about? It's not even 8 o'clock in the morning. I'm going to a matinee. What about all that stuff in the kitchen? It's not my job, man. Yeah. SARA: The fact is you're a vigilante. No, vigilantes save people, we don't do that. We're just exercising our constitutional rights, Ms. Rogers. SARA: I'm just saying that when you take the law into your... No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Some guy comes into my neighborhood and I don't care what color he is, but he comes here to rob and mug. He's taking the law in his hands and he's breaking it. I take the law in my hands, I'm on the right side of the law. That's...SARA: That's an interesting distinction. You walk a delicate line. Delicate? Well, that's not something we use in this neighborhood. Do you want to know what delicate is? We look around. Just go on, look around here. See what delicate is here. In the park there or... You want to take a look over the park? Get out of the way. Get the camera over there and look over there. Look over there. That's delicate. That's what we call delicate. This is very good.JOHN: Brothers beating on brothers. It's a city of brotherly love. Now, if the agencies of this city cannot protect the rights of my children to live in this neighborhood, then we as parents, we reserve the right to protect the rights of our children, whatever way we can and that's that. You really think he's after your seat? I think this guy is very shrewd. That's what I think. It looks to me like he's building a power base for himself. Al. With all due respect, this guy couldn't care less for your seat. A man like John D'Angelo has no use for the whole concept of City Hall. Now that's bullshit, Commissioner. That's what that is. You know, there's a whole tradition of political ambition from these guys, these vigilantes in this country. It's always been like that. Let me ask you something. You ever hear of a guy by the name of Colonel William Lynch from Virginia? Hmm? It's the guy that invented lynching And you know what? He went on to a political career. Oh, Jesus, Al, we understand how you feel. But there's nothing illegal about what he's done. I helped both you guys get where you are today. Now I want you to stop this guy. Somehow. This business is all about favors, Commissioner. Remember? You owe me a couple. John D'Angelo, right? Yeah.I'm Councilman Brusco. Right. You know, you've been a real inspiration to our constituency. I got to hand it to you. Thanks. You ever need anything, I want you to know my office is always open to you. Good to know. I'll see you. I'm going to get right to the point, John. We have reports on your activities. Frankly, we're not happy. Yeah, what kind of report? We know you're not adverse to beat the living shit out of your suspects. Hey, what the hell are you talking about? You infringed on a man's rights, Mr. D'Angelo. Even though that man's a criminal. And I'm talking to you not only as the police commissioner, but as a Black man. Now you do that and you open the door to your own rights being infringed upon. And when this country gets to the point where they forget the Constitution, forget where their laws come from... Hey, wait a minute. What, do you want me to do? Flash the Constitution, when I'm looking down the barrel of a .44 magnum? FREEMAN: Leave it to the police, D'Angelo. The police? We've got no problem with the police. We've got a few of them to ride with us. Look, this thing is bigger than what the police can do. FREEMAN: You're a goddamn fool if you think that. Hey, look, if I'm doing something illegal, arrest me! I do what I got to do! Hey, Commissioner, I'll tell you something. My family breathes a hell of a lot easier because I'm doing what I'm doing, And I'll lay odds, if your family lived in my neighborhood, they'd breathe easier, too. John, I want you to consider this meeting as two things. An introduction. A warning. Now I want you to feel free to phone me, come and see me about this anytime you want. But I also want you to know that I'm going to make your life miserable. I'm going to make your life miserable, because what you are doing is wrong. Nice meeting you, John. Yeah, sure, Commissioner. He'd never get the Black vote. [LAUGHING] [WOMAN SCREAMING] Get him! He's got my bag, get him! Agh! Agh! [GRUNTING] Don't you ever do that in this neighborhood again, you got that? 'Cause I'm everywhere. You understand? All right, you tell your friends to stay out of this neighborhood. MAN 1: What is that? MAN 2: What a jerk. MAN 3: What is this? I think what they need in local government is someone like John D'Angelo, somebody who is responsive to the needs of the community. I think you'd make a first-rate councilman. Yeah, well, I appreciate that. But... dealing with the streets is one thing and... [SIGHS] Well, I just don't think I'm the political type, you know? Well, the businessmen who put your name forward obviously think you are. I know you are. You have a lot of support in the community. You made the ward's safe for business again. That's certainly a political asset. Yeah, well, this is really something, you know? I'll think about it. Do. Do, John. WAITER: Cigar.Cigar? Thanks. Do think about it, John. I'd appreciate it. You know, men like you have special responsibilities. Men like you know how to meet the challenges of life. Can't say that about many people today. That's true. JOHN: Guys like me, we got special responsibilities, Vinnie. I mean, the problem ain't just in the streets, you know, it's the politicians, judges, you know what I mean? Councilman. That's just the beginning, though, Vinnie, you know. Governor D'Angelo, how's that sound to you? You know something, John? JOHN: What? You're an asshole. Fuck this. [LAUGHING] John, what qualifies you to run for office? What the hell's that have to do with it? Look, if I'm elected, I can pass legislation. I can do things we can't do in patrol. I know what to do, too. John, when was the last time you voted? Oh, come on, Lisa. I don't need that now. Come on, I didn't vote for Brusco, I'll tell you that. Didn't vote for him. LISA: Mario, keep your food on your plate...JOHN: Hey, wake up, will you. Come on. Get your head out of that. Why are you resisting me, anyway? What the hell is wrong with me running for councilman? Nothing, John, please believe me. Nothing, I want... I want you to run for office. I want to see the best for you. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] LISA: I just want you to know that you're neglecting me, you're neglecting your son. You're neglecting your business. I'm not going to work double shift...Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.You let me finish. You let me finish! I'm not going to work double shift in the deli anymore. I'm not gonna be the man and I'm not going to be the woman in this relationship. You telling me I don't do my share around here? [INDISTINCT SHOUTING]I'm not telling you... LISA: I'm not telling you you're not doing your share. You're just never around anymore. Oh, Mario. Oh, come on. What's with you, Mario? You... What's the matter with you? Hey, you sick? What's the matter with you? Open your eyes. You on medication? [GROANS]Look at his eyes. He's on something. Is this your stuff?Dad, no. Hey, you just sit tight! My God, he's on smack. You're in trouble, Danny. He's on smack. Look at this. Call his folks. I'm all right. Let me see. Let me see here. You and me are going to have a talk. JOHN: Okay, which one is Dusty? DANNY: He's the fat guy with the blue coat and glasses. JOHN: He doesn't look like a pusher to me. What did they... What did they use to look like in your day, Dad? Tell the truth, we've always been straight with each other. You're try any of this shit? No, Dad. Well, let me tell you something. Mario is in a lot of trouble. He's okay now, but if he continues the way he's going, I wouldn't count on tomorrow. Stay here. [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] DUSTY: Agh! Just shut up! Just shut up. I ever see your business over here, it's gonna be your ass. You understand? You'll get in a lot of trouble for this Mr... What're you going to do, call the cops, huh? Look, we own the cops. Ow! [BONES CRACK][DUSTY SCREAMS IN PAIN] All right. You tell me where that shit comes from or I'm gonna break the other arm. WOMAN: Oh, look, there's John D'Angelo. MAN: Hey, Mr. D'Angelo. John D'Angelo, let me shake your hand. I think you're doing a really terrific job. God bless you.KID: I saw you on TV. Yes, yes. KID: Don't go in there. It's poison. Lupo here? Lupo! Can I help you? Dusty call ya? Laurie, why don't you go in the back and fix you hair? So, you're D'Angelo, huh? You broke his arm? Hey, Lupo, we don't need people like you in the neighborhood. You're real tough, huh? I don't want trouble. You want trouble? You got it. You're real fucking tough, ain't you? When I come back, I don't want to find you here. If I do, I'm going to redecorate your face. I'll be waiting for you, D'Angelo. You're mixed in the family business here. You just made a fucking move, you're going to be sorry for it, boy. 'Cause you know why? You don't know what fucking trouble is. All right, jerk? I know what trouble is. You don't know what fucking trouble is. Jerk. Click the fuck off, asshole. Fucking creep. MAN 1: Look at the heap he's driving. Hey, Mr. Crusading Citizen. You got here early, huh? JOHN: Hey, I know enough not to be late for Mr. Donato. MAN 2: You said a mouthful there, kid. Now, look, you've got two minutes with him. That's it. He means two minutes, kid. Down front. Uh-uh. Over there. Uh, Mr. Donato? DONATO: Shh! [MOUTHING] Go ahead. I got this here, People's Patrol and we go around the neighborhood and we... No need to tell me, I know about you. Your father was Anthony D'Angelo a greengrocer from Genoa. He always wore a red vest. Yes. DONATO: His heart gave out. I was sorry. Thank you, sir. Mr. D'Angelo, I got maybe two minutes for you. Tell me just one thing, you're not using this patrol of yours to move in on my business? You know what I mean by my business? Yes, sir, I do. Nothing wrong with ambitious men. I was brought up in this neighborhood. I know all about your business, Mr. Donato. Yeah. What do you want? Well, I want to be safe and I want my family to be safe. It's tough as hell out there. Well, I don't have to tell you that. When you live in a nice, big house now with the... iron gates all around it. But it wasn't so long ago your family lives where I live. What do you want? I hear you don't hold with dope. Bad business, too... emotional. Well, this... Captain Chicken guy sells smack to kids in high school. He says he's got your protection. [CHUCKLES] I don't eat chicken. Chickens eat chicken. I don't hold with cannibals. Mr. D'Angelo, what you're doing, I respect. I understand protection. Here. Coin from the old country. Time between our families. Show it. People will understand. You do seem Mafioso. Thank you, Mr. Donato. [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] You got it, sucker. [LAURIE SCREAMING] No!Come on.

What the hell is the point? It's the way you do things, you're such a goddamn hot-head. What are you talking about? The patrol works. He's overworked, John. And if he keeps this up, it won't be long before he's out of work altogether. Vincent's job is at stake, John. We've got a couple of kids to think about, John. Lillian.We pay the mortgage. We help support his parents. Lillian.I know that, I understand all that.You turned my husband into a 24-hour cop.I know that! Lillian!I know that! [SIGHS] VINCE: All right, I'll tell you exactly what it is. Okay? In the beginning, when we first started this, I saw something, I don't know, good. An option for the neighborhood. But it's not working out right. The patrol's changed, they're getting out of hand. And you've changed, John. You know what you're becoming? And I'm going to tell you this because I've known you all my life. You're becoming another goddamn police problem. I'm sick and tired of police problems. You think about it. I gotta go to work. See ya. He may have to quit the patrol. The hell he will. John. Where are you? IVAN: We got the guys that cut your mama's finger off. Come on. Are you sure this is him?
