[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that fatal night a fiery mass dropped from the sky onto earth causing the mountain of samar to erupt and burn everything around it leaving nothing but a wasteland within the bowels of the mountain a new and monstrous life was formed from that day on the people of samar in order to survive were forced to offer their children as a sacrifice to the hungry mountain of death [Music] oh [Music] way [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] your poor people can no longer endure the endless human sacrifice you impose on them you know that i am your most faithful subject and that before you i served your late father with the same devotion listen to the desperate cries of the mothers of samar the screams of the innocent victims queen samara you cannot you must not allow this wanton slaughter you are old claudius old enough to remember what happened during my father's reign long before i was born i remember the faith that overtook those who dared to rebel is even worse than the destiny we face but this is change change yes there exists a man one who's so marvelous whose courage and whose strength have allowed him to overcome any danger that threatens and do you think you'll be able to conquer those who reign on the mountain of death yes if you were to lead us your people would succeed in the night fool you'll only destroy yourselves and me too samara my queen i beseech you you know it's the only hope we have so don't take it away i command you to stop send for this man he lives in chariot sent for him before it's too late your people are tired you dare to make threats get out of you it'll be too late [Music] claudius lied to you the man from sarah is about to arrive they must be meeting secretly what's his name hercules [Music] so [Music] so [Music] ah [Music] season uh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] samara you have failed hercules is alive he escaped from the trap you set for him alive but how can he avoid death at the hands of my best soldiers you underestimated that man remember as long as he stays alive he remains a threat to that destiny rick than the stars we will not be able to leave the mountain and dominate the world and you will not become the most powerful woman on earth i promise you he will die as soon as possible samara before the next full moon you must deliver the princess pillars to the sacrifice in order to howard queen selena [Music] i can't help you anymore i can only remain visible briefly and my time is up now you will be alone be careful and remember villas billis villas billy my mom it's been so long when are we going to be able to meet openly in front of everyone i'm going to speak to your sister no don't go why are you so frightened after your own my family is the most noble in samurai i've tried many times to speak to her of my future and of our love but i've always found samara strangely hostile your sister brings only sadness to everyone that's not fair to her face the facts the people are suffering they want to free themselves from fear they want to destroy the monsters of the mountain and now they might be able to do it no we could wipe them out but the queen is still opposed to it to fight against the mysterious power of the monsters no one has ever dared to do that i'm frightened derek don't worry i don't intend to lose you i love you and i intend to marry you as soon as possible i'll speak to samara and this time she'll hear me out to the end i swear and if she doesn't give her consent never mind we'll find a way are you hercules yes who are you what do you want i'm to lead you to the man who sent for you all right up with you as a boy who weren't very convincing i'm a god daughter of claudius i bet your father sent a girl to meet me and a child at that i've no brothers and my father trusts only me what difference does it make for the cause of liberty and justice i'm ready to do anything even to fight that too if it's necessary let's go i'll take you into seminary by our roots but only i know so [Music] it's the queen you just died i saw you leaving the city at daybreak agar i'm greatly honored that my queen should take the trouble to watch over me if i do so it's for your own good my dear the moon's almost full and you are young so young you should be more prudent hercules she's gone you can come out now let me thank you hercules for answering my prayers it was my father's friendship for you that brought me here did anyone see you neither in the city nor the kingdom but a few leagues from sama i was ambushed by a band of ruffians they must have mistaken me for a rich merchant with sacks of gold i changed their minds for them bandits that's strange all the roads that lead to samar are always carefully guarded did you get a chance to see who their leader was yes he had a thick black beard and there was a long ugly scar running down his cheek ah that's daddy well who is he one of mogold's soldiers and the right arm of the queen the queen but is she against you yes i'm afraid so when her father the late king was dying the last thing he said to me was what's over samara guide her cancer at the time i thought my task would be an easy one however only arrogance and limitless pride animate that woman together with unrestrained ambition i tried to induce her to rebel against the fate that for years has hung over us every third new moon our youth is decimated by a sacrifice that's barbaric and inhuman the next sacrifice takes place tomorrow hercules that's why i sent for you you've always been a great fighter in the cause of justice and you've always been the victor will you lead the people of samar to liberation that's what i'm here for claudius thank you but you won't be alone you will have every courageous man in the city beginning with the young prince derek's with you the cousin of the queen your daughter is as courageous as she is beautiful [Music] i would have chosen a more tranquil life for her without fear have no regrets father think of all the innocent lives we'll save if we win our fight [Music] but in leaving the palace it wouldn't be wise for you to take the same route by which you entered i'll show you the way through the secret tunnel follow me [Music] this is the moment so we're almost there ah [Music] father my child this is the end save hercules take him to the wrong father don't make me leave you go [Music] so so hercules so hercules okay great [Music] uh uh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] oh god [Music] i couldn't do anything to save him i'll never forgive myself for it there was nothing you could do we were being spied on by queen samara i ran after you to warn you we were too late i only got there in time to hear the last words of my father he ordered me to lead you to the rendezvous where he'd intended to take you you must join the others so that they'll know you're still alive and won't abandon us you know better than that i could never abandon you again thank you hercules on your shoulders rest the future of the people of samar i i have great admiration for you i will show you a way out of the palace that will lead us into open country beyond the city walls we must be very careful not to be seen as soon as night falls we can come back to the city [Music] so [Music] he broke his way out of that cave as if it were made of clay the monster's been killed and the iron bars are torn apart but there isn't any trace of hercules but no one has ever gotten out of these caverns alive that man is superhuman with such strength will never overpower him with cunning we will but it's necessary to get him alone with none of his friends around but friends i know who they are tomorrow i'll arrange to send away prince derek's do you have men you can trust to follow orders implicitly yes fine they'll accompany you where what does it matter the essential thing is to keep him from coming back and as for hercules i want him taken alive he'll pay dearly for all the trouble he's caused me the queen wouldn't deny her sister anything i know and i'm here to ask her for the greatest favor of my life everyone at court knows the only favor that will satisfy the prince's villas what is it i must talk to you samara get out i want you to promise that you'll hear me out haven't i always done so don't you really believe i'm fond of you don't say that samara even if we didn't have the same mother you've always been a perfect sister to me and i'm grateful i wanted to be perfectly clear that my attitude is dictated solely by my affection for you of course and because of that affection you could make me the happiest woman in the world samara prince darrick's loves me and if you'll only give your consent we'll be married immediately we love each other you can't refuse of course not how could i refuse you in fact i want you to marry but not as soon as you would like oh samara why are you making us wait it's been my intention for a long time now to send prince daryx to the court of karim to conduct secret negotiations on a matter of the greatest delicacy but he'll be back soon and you'll live happily ever after oh thank you thank you dear sister you'll be leaving the first thing tomorrow morning though he'll be away from you it won't be for very long are you satisfied oh i'm so happy claudius is dead hercules has disappeared the two of them were the only hope we had there's nothing left to do you can talk that way because you don't have children but if you had a daughter like my child you'd understand the anguish that a mother feels when the moon is full and you know they're coming to take her away to the sacrifice i know this fear my wife is right we can't bear living this way is you're the only one who's been to the top of the mountain of death tell them what happened to you there speak out tell us whether ordinary men can overcome the monsters i saw the mountain open up miraculously and i was bathed in a blinding green light then huge deformed rock-like creatures appeared and at the same time i was deafened by a weird sound that seemed to come from the depths of the earth after that i don't remember anything i was so terrified i was robbed of my senses i came to after a while and i found i was alone your experience only confirms the fact that it will not be easy for us to win i think it's useless only hercules can fight the monsters with any chance of surviving all i can say is this i'm the cousin of the queen whose attitude seems to indicate she's in love with our enemy i swear to you that i'm not influenced by any personal ambition the only thing i want is to liberate somehow from the nightmare that's oppressing us then my wife and i will go away asking nothing expecting nothing i am alone in the world my name is timor and it's on the list of those who have been selected as victims for the sacrifice but i prefer to die in combat with the monsters if my death will help deliberate you're right kevin quiet don't let them hear you who is it it's i agar with a friend hercules it's hercules i'm glad you're with us safe and sound our worries are over with you leading us we will win let me present prince dax hercules claudius thought very highly of you prince will get along well together my friends i know of the tragic destiny that hangs over you but what would happen if one day the people of samar were to refuse to send the sacrificial victims to the monsters in the mountain but no one has ever dared refuse yet it's certain that the monsters will come down from their caves in the mountain bringing with them death and destruction as they did that night now things are different the people of samar are finally prepared to fight to the death i doubt that but i promise you if our faith and resolution is sufficient sama will again be free another patrol is passing there have never been so many soldiers in the street surely they're looking for you hercules return to your houses alert everyone that they are to be prepared for the attack say that hercules will lead them and that the cousin of the queen prince barracks is on their side get going thank you hercules till we meet again you stay here with us no one will think i'm looking for you in my tavern [Music] pleasant dreams good night [Music] so you're back i expected to find you here weeping for the death of your father and instead of mourning him you've been wandering around the city i wanted to bring you words of comfort that might ease the cruel loss you've suffered you'll have to resign yourself and i would do so if it would prove to me that his death was destined that it expressed the true will of the gods instead my father was brutally assassinated and i ask you to punish the murderers i'll investigate but it's not going to be easy your father had no enemies my father asked only the fortune smile on the people of samar his enemies should be sought among those who did not share his ideas and therefore feared him i don't know to whom you refer but i can assure you that the iron hand of retribution will strike down the assassins as retribution will always crush those who dare to challenge my will i never thought the time would come when i would greet you with such joy and in the same breath have to say goodbye watch and you'll see that my horse will fly on the wind like pegasus take care of yourself and come back soon when can i hope to see you again in a few days have you spoken of this to queen samara yes when she was giving me the instructions for the mission i'm to carry out for in quorum she made several references to our marriage plans it's strange but the way your sister spoke it seems she has no objections and sending me off as her ambassador with such good faith well now you're the most important relative of the queen you're right it's late and i must go goodbye my love promise it's only three days not a minute more have to go well is it true that derek has been sent away on orders from the queen yes i might have known she'd do something like that what are you trying to say i don't wish to alarm you billy but i think it's necessary you'll be told the queen's aware that derek's is taking part in the conspiracy but you think he's in danger yes i think he's walking into a trap oh agar don't give up hope princess come with me i know a man who's powerful enough to help us both and i'm sure he won't refuse you [Music] along that road they take the victims to the sacrifice beyond those woods in the river is the mountain of death come on i want to see it hercules they told me the tavern you'd be here the princess villas need your help that's your service the queen has sent barracks away on a mission to kara it's only a pretext she found out that derricks is one of the conspirators timor get my horse fast derek is already on the road to cory he left about an hour ago you would better go back to the palace princess and don't be afraid even if it costs me my life derex will be saved hercules [Music] i trust you to get them safely back to the city [Music] uh [Music] what are you doing [Music] uh [Music] [Music] i arrived just in time prince i owe you my life don't worry about that we've got to think about your wound that arrow's really in deep at nightfall i'll get you safely into the city [Music] we're ready to depart my queen and my sister sleeping sleeping like a baby after that draft you had prepared for her the horses are ready no one will see us let us go [Music] this is in danger i feel it save her it's a full moon the night of the sacrifice the the queen the queen watch out for he's delirious leave him to me hercules i know certain herbs that can cure even a wound like this get them are you absolutely sure that he was attacked on orders from the queen yes i am they were her soldiers what is it that's turned her against even her most faithful subjects and explain why she's so anxious to get me the queen didn't even know me she didn't know i was coming here but still she tried to have me murdered on the highway and then she nearly caught me in the trap that cost the life of claudius how could she always guess where i'd be the people say she has powers that are supernatural she possesses a magic powder which causes any man who takes it to look at her through the eyes of love they say she's never without it she carries it in a gold locket around her neck that's useful to know when i eventually come face to face with queen samara [Music] [Music] it's late why hasn't anyone come the news that derek's has gone away and that you followed him has certainly robbed our friends of all their courage we'll have to restore their confidence but we'll have to wait till daybreak because the city is full of soldiers taking victims for the sacrifice ah [Music] [Music] wow [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] but why why do the gods permit this you must have faith tyrus the time of our liberation is near before long we'll see that nothing remains of this but the memory of terror [Music] they're here you're in there did you hear me open up my head open my daughters stay calm go on don't attempt to resist we're here to take your daughter where is she no no no no you're outsiders uh ah hercules there's no time to be wasted they'll be returning with reinforcements we must find a safe place for derricks i know a place where he can hide [Music] hercules [Music] phyllis has been taken i saw her and changed with the other prisoners go on ahead they're on the march yes but don't go now you can't do anything alone i beg you wait for the others no that might be too late what would become of me if anything should happen to you don't worry nothing will [Music] run [Music] all right [Music] so [Music] so [Music] here they go [Music] [Music] so [Music] come princess [Music] we've got to at last [Music] [Music] you see [Music] they're absolutely identical that is why i ordered you to bring the princess phyllis our queen selena will awaken from her long sleep and will live again through the blood of phyllis you're my own sister you brought me here to kill me how could you be such a monster tell me that it isn't true zamara i beg you [Music] tamara tomorrow i beseech you [Music] wow [Music] the sacrifice will take place tomorrow night behold when the planet saturn comes into conjunction with mars and under the evil influence of uranus then will occur unimaginable disasters the oceans will rise the mountains crumble and inexorably our moon will draw near the earth through this cataclysm only our form of life can survive after the long night of sleep we shall become the masters of the earth but how shall i live then you will have the reward you have earned samara your beauty will never fade and your power will be equal to ours you will possess all the riches of the

would have been lying at my feet a dead [Music] but i prefer the challenge you offer alive [Music] i know that you are strong enough to crush me but it's worth the risk why all you'd have to do is reach out a hand and take me by the throat and break my neck the way you break the stem of a flower why don't you do it you have nothing to fear for me now that i've seen you i can no longer rebel against you i want to stay with you it's hercules who asks this no slave is as faithful as i would be [Music] [Applause] [Music] come hercules come and drink to our friendship [Music] we'll toast our

been killed derricks is in the hands of the queen and we don't even know whether hercules is alive hercules isn't a man to let himself be put out of the way that easily i agree with tertius i have a son i don't know whether he's dead or alive but that doesn't change anything let me and i say orders are ours an officer of the royal guards rubio what are you doing here i know just what you and your
