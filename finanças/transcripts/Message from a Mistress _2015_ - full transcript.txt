Subtitles by explosiveskull I'm that bitch. You know. The one every woman wishes she could be. The one every man wishes he could be with. My name is Jessica Bell. My friends call me Jessa. See... How do I begin? He's my lover... and her husband. Yeah, I mean, she has the ring, she has the marriage license, but I have him. And in this game, as far as I'm concerned, there can only be one winner. Me. Ma, what's burning? Huh? Oh, shoot! Oh, Kieren, hand me that towel, baby. I was trying to make breakfast for Daddy before his fishing trip. You? Cook? Is it Flashback Friday? Oh, really? - Oh, wait, can I have this orange? - No! - Why not? - Because! - I-I need it for... - It's just for breakfast. Hey babe! Good morning. I was, uh, trying to make breakfast for my husband. Good work. I'm trying, Jackson. And I love you. Hey, look, we need to talk. About what? We can talk about it later. Check your eggs. Come on, sweetie, let's go. School time. - And I'm eating this orange. - No! - Come on. - No. Let me hold the orange. I'm gonna give it back. - No. - I'll give you back half of it. - No. - Why not? Damn. Oh, baby. Oh, I love you. Damn. Mm, I love you. I love you, too. Baby, I asked you to get me up at 7 AM, not for you to get up too. I had to. I wanted to get some before you left. Plus, I needed to get up early so I can get some writing done before I go hang out with the girls. Me and my boys, we're about to catch a gang of fish today. Yeah. Y'all better get back, 'cause I'm telling you right now, - I ain't saving no plates. - You better save me a plate. You better save me a plate. I ain't saving... You get back here. - Don't play. - You get back here. I will. I promise. I ain't missin' any fish. So look. I've started my practice. - Mm-hmm. - And my baby, she's about to be a best-selling author, novelist. Right, yeah right. I wanna have a family. I wanna start a family. You know, when I finish my book, and I get an editor, and get published... it's a lot on a sister's plate. Just... be patient with me, Dr. Livewell. I just need a little more time before we start having a bunch of crumb-snatchers running around here. Baby, you've been working on that book for two years, all right? It's my first novel! Masterpieces take time. - What? - Okay. Hey. What? No, mm-mm. I'm not done with you yet. Where are you going? What you mean, you ain't done with me? Where you going? - It's the encore. - Is this fair? No. Is this fair? Is this fair? I'm serious. I want a family. No peeks. Baby. Okay. Good morning, Bishop. Have a good day. Oh! Hello? Aria, girl, you are not going to believe what your crazy ass Uncle Junebug did. That fool done went out and got another tramp pregnant. Baby mama number five, Lord Jesus, oh. I'm working, Mom. Well, that's your problem, not mine. Girl, you married a doctor. Why are you working anyway? I'm a writer. I'm writing. That's what writers do. Yeah, but you ain't sold nary book. But you know what? When you finish that thing, I'm gonna buy the first 10 copies, and I want them all autographed by my baby girl. Bye, Mama. This woman. Oh, crap. Okay. I think you should lead the toast. - Uh-uh, why me? - Because if Jamie does it, we'll be here all day with her prayer. There's always a good time for prayer. Amen to that. So, we're gonna take this time to do a toast to my ladies, whom I love, and I'm so happy that we do this every single Friday, 'cause it is Ladies' Friday. - Yes. - Hear, hear. It's bad luck to toast with water, Jamie. Yes, it is. Mm, mm, mm-hmm. So refreshing, so good for the body. Mm, mm, mm-mm. - Tap out. You win. - Where's Jessa? She's two hours late. No, no, she's not coming. - She mentioned she had something else to do. - What? What does she have to do where she can't be here? It's not like she has other friends, or a man. Mm, actually, she mentioned she was seeing somebody new! - What? - Yeah! Okay, no, no, no, please share details! Well, um... What in God's name is that? Oh, come on, you can't start and not finish. - Do you know about this guy? - Mm-mm. I know sometimes I work late at the office, but seriously? - You've never seen this guy? - Mm-mm. I don't know. Seeing somebody, 'cause I've been telling her for the longest... Uh, Renee? Sweet Jesus, Lord. - Uh, Renee? - Hmm? This sexy piece of caramel was at the door asking for you. Come on, baby, take it off. Listen, y'all are some thirsty hoes. This is my assistant, Darren. Did you just use that language? - Sorry, Darren. - It's okay, Mrs. Clinton. Here are those files you requested. Oh, yes. Thank you. Of course. Now, if you need anything else, feel free to just give me a call. - I'll be back at the office. - Okay, thank you Darren. - No problem. - Okay. - All right. - I'll walk you out. No problem, I can show myself out. - Oh, okay. - Ladies. Thank you. Bye, Darren! Dang, Renee. Now I see why you spend so many hours at work! Okay, y'all have some issues. Stop it! Come on... I am a happily married woman, thank you. Mm-hmm. And that boy is way too young. He's still wet behind the ears. He probably still wears Underoos. So true. You're married, not dead. As long as you don't do anything, there's nothing wrong with admiring God's creations. Hear, hear. I would admire that erry day. Wow, so vulgar. I can't deal with y'all chicks today. Oh no-no-no, no, no, sit. You sit. Darren probably came back 'cause he forgot something. I don't want y'all two broads salivating over him again. - I'm just getting a napkin. - No. You really need to get a proper doorbell, Aria. And you really need to stop eating cupcakes, Jamie. I'm serious. You can go from the chick with the fat ass to the fatass chick. Watch. Whoo-hoo! Ooh. Special delivery! Mm! Really? Wow. Really, Renee? Those are gorgeous. - Hmm! - Well, would you come open it? Oh! I thought they were for you. I thought that was your assistant, huh? Okay, no, Darren did not bring me these. They were already out on your porch when I went out there, so I assume they are for the lady of the house. - Moi? - Yes, would you hurry up and open it? Look at Kingston over here, flexing his romantic muscles. - It's "to her." - A DVD? Really? Let me find out that you and Kingston did a "Mimi and Nico" fake sex tape? Really? That's what we're about to watch? Girl, bye. Oh, okay. Actually, it says "to her," and Bishop Eric does know I'm here, so the flowers are probably for me. You know, no, no, no, Jamie has a point. 'Cause Jackson knows I'm over here, too. So how do we know this is not for me? Well, there's only one way to find out, ladies. Cough it up. Give it! I'll play it, 'Nee. My sweet husband. Surprise! It's me. This message is for her. I knew where to find you, because it's girls' night, where we hang with the clique. As you know, I won't be attending the festivities this go 'round. Or, ever again, for that matter. There are many forks in the road in life, and I decided to travel down the path leading straight into your husband's open arms. Yes, your husband. I can't lie, and say I regret it. I need him more than you do, and I love him more than you ever will. This morning? You saw him. For the last time. Tonight, he comes home to me. He's my man now. Thank you. Thank you for not being woman enough for him. I am twice the woman you are. As a matter of fact, he whispered that in my ear just a few weeks ago in your bed. I mean, if you have yet to figure it out, you most definitely will. Tonight. When you're sleeping alone, and your husband's arms are wrapped around me. Bye bye, now. - What the f...? - Oh my God. Does she think this is funny? This is not funny. Sorry, ladies. It's just that Jessa's little silly game - made me just lose my brunch. - Right. Oh, gosh. Did you get Jessa on the phone? Do you hear me talking on the phone to anybody, Jamie? Obviously the bitch didn't pick up. All right, this is all bad. Jessa, this is Aria. We got your little DVD message. Be woman enough to call us back. Matter of fact, be woman enough to bring your raggedy behind down here. You know where we are. Slut... tramp.. whore. Kingston's not answering the phone. All right, fine, let me call, see if Jackson will answer his cell. Hold on. Jackson's cell's gone straight to voicemail, too. The point is, she can only leave - with one of our husbands, right? - Right. So you said that you met up with Jessa the other week, and she mentioned she started seeing somebody, so... Yeah, we had lunch about four Fridays ago. Damn. They don't make 'em like that anymore. - Hey! - Oh! Hey, boo! Oh, you know what, I am so glad you chose Uncle Andre's. You know it's my favorite spot, right? Uh-uh. Girl, you are glowing. Did you get some last night? Um, I'm really trying to figure out what I'm gonna eat. So you are seeing someone! Yeah! I'm... no, not per se. Not necessarily seeing anyone like that. Okay, Aria, yes, I am seeing someone. Jessa, you don't have to feel guilty about moving on. It's been some time, so many years, since Mark passed away, okay? You deserve to move on with your life. At some point, you have to. All right? You deserve loved up, loved on, again, and again, and again. So...? When do we get to meet him? Um... Wow. We're taking things super... super-duper slow. So, meeting friends and family and all that that's probably not gonna happen. Not any time soon. You gotta give me something. I mean, like, where's he from? - The peach cobbler... - Does he have any kids? - What tax bracket is he in? - The peach cobbler is awesome. Social security? What does he look like? - I mean... - Okay, Curious Georgette. He looks... handsome. And, we, uh... we met through a, um... mutual friend. Okay! Uh-huh. Let's go, ladies. We need to get to the bottom of this hot mess and pay Miss Jessa Bell a visit. Come on. Come on. The one who sleeps alone tonight. So alone. She'll know. She'll know that I'm the better woman. Mm. Oh, hell, I wish he would have skipped that damn fishing trip. I mean, really. I've got all the red snapper he needs right here. Welcome to the whorehouse, ladies. Wow. Yo, this just got way real. - Where are you going? - Looking for clues. There isn't anything here. I should have known better than to trust that slut. I did her English paper freshman year! I should have known better than to trust anything that pees sitting down around my husband. I'm married to a fine ass doctor. Broads always trying to come up. I gotta protect what's mine! Who would have known I had to be on high alert around my friend. Yeah. We were always so competitive, but to think she'd go after my husband! I remember when I first introduced him to her punk ass. Jessa, meet the love of my life and the changer of my last name. Well, it's nice to meet you, Dr. Livewell. I hope you live up to your surname, for Aria's sake, of course. It was nice to meet you, Jessa. I'm gonna let your girlfriend handle that whole thing you just said. Well, you know, I'll have you know that you just made yourself a new friend, Kingston. Okay, well, any friend of Aria's is a friend of mine, so... Um, you know what, I need you two to put on some grown-up clothes, get cleaned up. We taking you out. Who's we? You got a boo? Girl, no. Me and two other couples from the neighborhood. We're just... treating you to dinner, like a welcome to the neighborhood thing. Yeah! Jamie and Renee, actually. You're gonna love them. - All right. - Free food! I'm in. - I'll get a shower. - All he needed to hear. It's like he won the lottery. I felt... Babe, seriously? I like him. - You do? - You did, girl. Thinking back on it, this is most likely when Jessa planned her attack. So what are you saying, Aria? It's me. I know it's me. Trying to play me. Is he serious? Hey, baby! What's up! Where have you been? Our song is playing! Oh, are you missing your big daddy? - Where have you been? - Store run. Did you leave the stuff in the car? 'Cause you came in here empty handed. No, your mom sent me to the store for a deck of cards. Mm-hmm? Baby, I think you should talk to Jessa. Why? 'Cause, I came out front, and she had her head down, so I told her to take a ride with me to the store. Kiss your wife. Give me the cards. - You'll need your hands. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Wait, baby? Okay, look, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - Grab my hair. - People are gonna see us. Oh my... Okay... All right... Wait, I don't understand why you had to give Kingston oral sex. Wanted to see if he smelled like soap. Like he cleaned up. Or if he smelled like Jessa. And? He smelled like neither. So it was a reward. To remind him that he was being taken care of at home. So... if he wouldn't mess with her then, what makes you think he's messing with her now? I don't know. Maybe they bonded while they were on their way to the store alone. Or maybe your mind is just playing tricks on you. Or maybe her woman's intuition is telling her that something is going on between Kingston and Jessa. I could hurt Jessa so bad right now. I'm so serious. Now, now, now. He is your husband. It takes two to tango. Yo, if you don't shut your bougie, delusional ass. God. Hand me the bottle, 'Nee. Might as well get faded while we're trying to figure out which one - of our marriages is over. - That is not funny, Aria. Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie. So, so, if we just pretend Jessa didn't drop a bombshell in all of our laps, it'll go away? You know, I'm sorry, ladies. I gave it a lot of thought, and I took it into prayer, and it's absolutely not Bishop Eric. We don't believe you. You need more people. Okay. Stop. Okay? We cannot start turning against each other, because it's none of our faults. And did you just quote Jay Z? Jamie, you're right. It's not Eric. It's not Kingston, either, Aria. How do you know? 'Cause it's Jackson. He told me this morning. Oh, Renee. I am so sorry. No, wait, he just walked up on you and told you he's having... he's sleeping with Jessa? This morning I told Jackson that I love him. He replied, "We need to talk." But that doesn't mean anything. It could be like you told me, you know, your mind could just be playing tricks on you. He could want to talk to you about millions of different things. Jackson is fed up with me working. I mean, come on, guys, we don't need the money. It was my choice. I started going back to work because I needed to be fulfilled. I mean, you don't understand wh-when the... when the kids started going to school, staying at home all day? Washing and cleaning? Come on, that got old! I'm a college-educated woman! I never thought that my career w-would... would jeopardize my marriage! One night Jackson invited all of his colleagues to our house for dinner, and... You know, I was up against a deadline for a marketing proposal. I asked Jessa to help out. - That's crazy. - Do you remember that? I do. I do. I totally forgot about that. - Wow. - Goodness, yeah. - That was hilarious. - How did that... - Good times. - Yeah, yeah, no. But listen, hey, I appreciate you coming over to help. - I really do. - Oh, Jackson. I mean, look at this place. I couldn't... there's no way I could have done this. Oh, please! It's fine! I love to help. Hey. I'm home. Hi! - Hey, Jessa. - Hey. Yeah. Hi, baby! Well, since you are back, I'm gonna... I guess I'm gonna head home. Thank you for everything, Jessa. I didn't do anything. You had everything planned perfectly. The caterers are in the kitchen throwing down. I had some of the samples. Delicious. Dropped the kids off at your mom's, and the table's set. Everything's good to go. Thank you. Jackson, I am sorry that I couldn't be here tonight. Couldn't, or wouldn't? Why do you keep fighting me about my work? You know that I am the vice president of marketing for a Fortune 500 company, which entails a lot of responsibility, - a lot of hours... - And so does being a wife! So, you... You're completely comfortable asking another woman to do your wifely duties? Wifely duties? Look, Jackson, let me tell you something. I know that I work, but I am still... I'm sorry, I'm looking for Mrs. Clinton? Yes, how can I help you? Um... the other Mrs. Clinton? I am Mrs. Clinton. I am the one and only Mrs. Clinton. What can I help you with, honey? Do either of you have the boating information? I'm sure we can reach them in case of emergency. And say what, huh? Oh, we should call them and say, "Excuse me, can I talk to the captain? "Can you please ask the three gentlemen, "'which one of you is a no-good cheating husband who's not coming home to his wife tonight?'" Now, what are you doing? I'm texting Jessa. She won't respond to any of our calls. Maybe she'll just... I mean, maybe she'll answer my text. Hello, Bishop. What are you doing? Jessa's? Oh. Fixing her blinds, I see. Last week it was her garbage disposal. I... I know that Mark is no longer here, and you guys have been friends for... Oh, don't be silly. Of course not. I don't want you to stop everything and come home. I... I'm just here, just studying Mark 12 through 14. All right. All right, baby. Oh, hey. Hi Jessa. Girl, I... I had to borrow your husband, again. You know I'm revamping the entire house, right? Including the drapes. So, we're just in here interior decorating. Oh, hey babe! Oh. Not only does my husband know the Word, apparently he's an interior decorator. Actually, I thought I'd come by and lend a hand since I was at home doing nothing. Oh. Well, by all means, the more the merrier. - Come on in. - Oh, glory be. - Glory be. - You look fantastic. Oh, Renee. Don't cry. I know it's difficult, but I don't think you need to worry. After listening to both of you, I'm pretty certain that it's Kingston. Bitch, please. You got the same message we did. I am a first lady. Do not refer to me with such vulgarity. Uh-huh. I call it like I see it. So do I. Stop it! The three of us are still best friends! We cannot let Jessa... She can't turn us against each other! I'm sorry. You're right. I'm sorry for calling you out your name, and wanting to slap the taste out your mouth. Apology accepted. Well, I need a shower, and I'm over this abandoned house. Can we please go home? - Yes. - Yes. Come on, sassy first lady. Stop it. Hey, lover. I'm home. The movers are all gone, and I'm just... I'm just here, all alone, just thinking about you, waiting on you, waiting to feel you inside of me. Tonight, lover. Oh, tonight is all about you. Regrets? I have none. You know, when Mark died, I thought I'd never love again, but I found life in his arms. I learned how to be again. I learned how to breathe again. He did that for me. He did, and no one could ever understand that. No one. I couldn't pass up the chance to feel loved again, to feel cherished and adored and... This is no fling. This is just the beginning for us. Little Miss Broken-Hearted, she'll be getting her divorce papers this week. And when she does, and everything is legally squared away, I'll marry the man that I love. Yeah. To my happiness. Cheers. You've been coming here once a month for the last five years. You only watch me perform, and then you leave without saying anything to me. You're one of my biggest fans. You know what you need? - A private dance. - Oh, no. No, no, no. - You game? - I'm married, thank you. I'm married. Let's go. Don't worry, you're in good hands with Pleasure. Oh. So... what exactly did you mean by private consultation? Oh, my. Front door open. Welcome home, wife. Eric, you're home early. Is there something wrong? Nasty girl. I'm a nasty girl. Eric, it's not what you think, honey. - It's not what you... - Shh. Are you my nasty girl? Yes, I'm your nasty girl. "Take me, my Pleasure. I'm your nasty girl." That's some message you left me, wifey. What's my name? Pleasure... No, no, it's not what it seems. I can explain this. - Eric, please no, please no. - Shut up! Yes! - Okay, okay... - Shut your mouth. Yes! I had no idea that I married a slut. - I can't breathe. - A no-good whore, someone that will beg another man to... - I can't breathe... - ...to do her like a trick? You still breathing? I hate you, Jamie. You hear me? I don't give a damn what happens to you from here on out. I could kill you. You've got the audacity to walk in my house, still wet from sex with another man. That's what you do to me, Jamie? Baby, I love you. I'm so sorry. You love me? - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - You really love me? Jamie, if you loved me... I would hate to be married to a woman who hated me. How was your day? Everything go well at church today? Mother came by this afternoon. She helped me make your favorite, red velvet cupcakes. Hmm! I almost forgot to tell you, the Martins had it out on the lawn today. She egged his BMW and slashed his tires. Can you believe it? I was watching it, and I felt like I was watching a soap opera live. It was better than one of those Tyler Perry plays. This is ridiculous, Eric. If you're going to ignore me, why do you come to dinner? If you're going to ignore me, why do you come home? If you're going to ignore me, why are we together? It's been a year since my indiscretion. I've apologized from the bottom of my heart. Are you ever going to forgive me? Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses. Please answer. Hello? Hey, Mom. Well, don't sound so excited to hear from me. No, I-I'm sorry. It's just I was hoping you were Kingston. Baby, what's wrong? Oh my God, Mama. Baby, what is it? Jessa sent over this DVD message to me, Renee and Jamie, saying she's having an affair with one of our husbands, and he's not coming home tonight, but leaving to be with her instead. - What? - And she was serious. Did you talk to Kingston? No, I tried calling him. He went on a fishing trip with Eric and Jackson. There's no reception there and he's not coming home until tonight. First off, that skank Jess needs her ass whupped. She is so irrelevant right now. This is about the commitment that was made between y'all and y'all's husband, not her. Believe it or not, it is not about that triflin' Jess Bell. This is about your marriages, because if it wasn't her, it could have been somebody else. You know, a faithful man remains faithful regardless of the woman or the temptations. - Do you understand that, Aria? - Yes, Mom. Okay now here's the million-dollar question for you. Do you think your husband's cheating on you? Don't think about it, just answer from your gut. Before the DVD message, I would say no. But I'd also say I wouldn't put nothing past my man. So you think Kingston has left you? Yes. Oh, hell no. Ariana Monique Gold, you are not crying. I just... I just don't know what to do, Mama. Baby, look, it is really simple. Either that dirty dog does not deserve one tear shed over his corpse, or it's not him, and you're worrying about nothing. Sweetie, in my opinion, in a few hours, you're going to see that you're just worrying about a whole bunch of nothing, okay? Kingston loves you. He adores the ground you walk on. He wouldn't cheat on you with that heifer. I pray you're right. Do you need me to come down there? No. No, I just need some time alone to regroup. All right, you call me back after you hear from your husband, all right baby? Call me back, okay? Bye, Mama. - Okay, I'm ready. - One, two... - Okay, wait. - What? - Okay. - One, two... stop laughing. - Okay, okay. - One, two, three, cheese. - That's so sad. - Yes, give them face. Only you would have a doggone selfie stick. Yes, I'm leaving this one with you. It's convenient. You're going to love it. - I'm telling you. - Goodie goodie. I'll take these with my man. See, now that's entirely too much information. - TMI? - Too much information. It's the alcohol speaking. Cheers. Oh, that was my freshmen year at Columbia. Oh, I look good. - Okay, you're so humble. - No. If I can get into that school, girl, and turn my life around... Oh goodness, wait a minute. We're not about to have a Mama... we were going to have that "Mama, I made it" moment. "I made it out the hood, Mama." Stop. No, I've done some things I'm not proud of. Haven't we all? Drinking, hoeing, running credit card scams, robbing folks, shoplifting, popping pills, smoking weed, drinking. - Oh, we do that. - We still do that. Yeah, I still do that. - We're good at it. - Threesomes, foursomes. I was on the track, when I was 15, one night, I was walking home, and dude pulled up beside me, offered me $200 for some head. I said, "I am not a hoe, I am not on the track, I am walking home, okay?" Then he said, "How about $3,000?" That's a lot of money at 16. I'd never seen that much money in my life, you know. So I said, "Sure." Do you know what he said? "Now that we have established that you are a hoe, now we just have to negotiate." I ended up getting $500. Wow. If I knew... being so stupid... would still affect my life today... I... Aria, don't. Okay, I mean, it's the past. I mean, it's a shady ass past, I can't even lie, but it's the past nonetheless. I wish life were so simple and cute, but when you're 15 and having sex and abortion after abortion after abortion, life has a way of punishing you because now... now... I can't have babies. I can't give my husband the one thing he wants from me. So I lie, because I don't have the heart to tell him... "Hey, hubby, I used to be a hoe." I've had a bunch of trains ran on me and a gang of abortions and now, I can't get pregnant. So I come up... with... excuse after excuse... as to why now... is not the best time... for me to give... m-my husband... who I love... the one thing he asks of me... a... a bab... a baby. I started my practice, and my baby, she about to be a best-selling author novelist. Yeah, right. I want to have a family. I want to start a family. And I love you. Yeah, but we need to talk. - About what? - We can talk about it later. At the tone, please record your message. When you are finished recording... She's your queen. Wow, you look gorgeous. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I mean, it's a lot for a school recital. No, no, no, no. No, no. See, actually I was going to say you look a little underdressed for my awards banquet tonight. You're not... you're not going to your daughter's dance recital tonight? Jackson, we already discussed this. Getting this award is a big accomplishment for me tonight and I want you there by my side with me. Look as a parent, my primary concern is for my child, so I'll be at the recital. Look, I'd advise you to do the same. Jackson, you and I both know that Kieren has a recital once a month, and I've already talked to her. She understands that Mommy and Daddy are missing only this one recital. Kieren barely understands her homework. Look, how... how many times is your job going to be more important than this family? What? How many times is this job going to be more important - than this family? - I heard you. Jackson, I am a great mother, and a phenomenal wife, and I have been that for years. And I'm just also trying to be a brilliant career woman, and me receiving this award tonight justifies that obviously I'm pretty good at it. But I am still a phenomenal wife and I am still a great woman. I am just now also a phenomenal career woman. But I'm all three, Jackson, all three, and I really would like if my husband would support me and be there by my side to help me climb up the ladder, not keep trying to drag me down. - Drag you down? - Yes. I'm sorry to drag you. Let us not pretend, I don't support your career or what it's doing to this family. Look at us. Jackson, wait. Jackson! Jackson, would you just please wait? Fine, you go to the recital then and afterwards, can you and the kids come meet me at the banquet? Okay. Okay. Congratulations. Thank you. Cheers. Hey, boss. Um. Hey! Hey. What are you doing here? It is almost midnight. Well, I mean, if you want to keep winning awards, someone's got to do the work. Say what? It was just a joke now, but what are you doing here? Why aren't you out celebrating? I am. I am enjoying my drinks and I am celebrating and toasting me because nobody else gives a damn. Well, you look absolutely beautiful tonight, and I admire the work that you do. You truly inspire me. Thank you. I am so happy that somebody that I know actually appreciates the work that I do. You know what, I know of a good way we could top off the night. Careful now, boy. That sounds like an indecent proposal. It is. Oh, God, okay. Please, stop. Please, let's stop. Please, stop. Just no. Can you help me up, please? Thank you. Oh, God. No words necessary. It was awful. Oh God, you ain't never lied. Oh God, it was awful. But you know what, okay, I'm sorry, Darren. It was probably because I had too much alcohol and there's a big age difference between us and I can only get wet for my husband and it's probably because... I'm gay. Oh. Thanks for letting me stop here so late, girl. I just needed a night away from Jackson. Renee? Please. Mi casa, su casa. You know that. That's what friends are for. You and Jackson had a fight? Tell me, what happened at the banquet? Jackson's hard-headed, stubborn mule ass never even showed up. What? He never came to the banquet, and he made a heavy guilt trip on me because I missed our daughter's recital. So to make a long story short, me emotional, a lot of drinks, a cute enough assistant that just thinks that I am God's gift to men, at work, after hours, oh God, really bad foreplay. I mean, really, really bad. Package wouldn't function. My self-esteem plummets even further. Assistant tells me he's gay. Mm-hmm! And, uh, me, now, 2 AM, at your house, and I am drunk as a skunk. Oh, my God. I mean, I can't believe you almost cheated on Jackson. And it was awful. My nipples are raw, my vajayjay is bruised, and I don't mean that in a good way. Hmm... So I take it you and Jackson are having problems? Hmm. In fact, I have a feeling that if... I am going to lose my husband and my family if I don't, if I don't stop working. No. There's always going to be shades of gray. You've got to find the middle ground. Don't quit your job, okay. Don't do that. You deserve to be happy. - Right. - Okay. Thanks. At the tone, please record your message. Hey Jackson, um... this morning you said to me that we need to talk. Those can be some of the scariest words that any wife... that any wife hears from her husband, because for the first time in our marriage, you have introduced a fear to me that our marriage could come to an end. And of course, I know I could probably be assuming the worst, but Jackson, I'm... you're my heart, and our family means everything to me. If uh... if working means losing you, then I promise you I will quit. I just want things to go back the way they used to be between us. I need you. Jackson, I need you. Jack... Damn. These women. Wow, they have been sending me all kinds of texts, threatening voicemails. I pay them no mind, okay. I have things to do. I have a life to prepare. Got to get ready for my man's arrival. Well, would you look at the time. It's almost 7 PM. He'll be here shortly. So you're drinking now. You disgust me. Oh Eric, after the day I've had, no, the year I've had, frankly darling, I don't give a damn what you think. All right. Like having one night stands with strippers and cursing? That's so disrespectful. Disrespectful? No, disrespectful is getting a message from your husband's mistress. - My what? - Your whore. Yeah, Jessa, she sent us a message via DVD, actually it was quite cute. And you're calling someone else a whore? Please. You're defending your mistress to me. Is that it? You know you lost your rights to question me when you opened your legs up to another man. Frankly, Eric, I'm surprised you're here because your mistress said you wouldn't be coming home tonight. Oh wait, did you forget something? Was it your Bible? Not that I care, but those are lies. Are they? You know, having to listen to my wife have sex with another man on the phone... I wouldn't care if I brought a woman home and screwed her in your bed. Why are you here, huh? I punished myself, and I've allowed you to punish me over and over again. But no, no, no more, Bishop Eric Maurice Hall. No more. What do you mean by that? Like I said, what do you mean by that? What do I mean? I'll tell you what I mean. All my life, I've tried to be the perfect little girl. I got the perfect grades, I never got my clothes dirty, I never did anything wrong because I wanted my parents to be so happy and so proud of me. - And? - And you know what I mean, Eric. You know exactly what I mean. My entire life, through college, I wanted everyone to like me, and this marriage, I wanted it to be perfect. The perfect everything, the perfect wife, the perfect first lady, but I'm tired of being perfect, and you know what? You can take your perfect whore and have a perfect little life together. Jamie. What? What? Don't speak because I'm done. I'm done talking. I'm done begging, I'm done praying. I'm done being treated like a second class whore in my own house. I wish you and Jessa the best. I pray for you. My church has been in this family for 50 years and I will not allow you to embarrass me or my family from that congregation with this nonsense that you're talking. Now I don't believe in divorce and you know that, Jamie. I do, and I didn't believe in it either, until I realized how disgusting it was being married to you. I will kill you before I allow you to leave this marriage. What are you going to do, Bishop? Put me in a chokehold, pin me down, strangle me, read some scripture? That's what I thought. What up, stranger? Where you been? Haven't seen you in a while. You used to come by every month. Oh, well, I've just been busy. You came to see me? You don't want to go back into that club, do you? And you want me to do you again, don't you? Get a room. I should be done by 12. Oh, Pleasure, how much? All night? All night. Two thousand. See you later. - Hey, babe. - Hey. Have a good day? - It was cool. - Did you catch any fish? I'm going to take a shower. I'll call you back. Hey, so is everybody still coming over for the fish fry later and play cards? Yeah, as far as I know. Eric and Kingston too? Yeah, you just asked me that. Okay, just asking. Renee... Really? You got my phone? Why do you have my phone? Jackson, do you want a divorce? - Do you? - Hell no. I do not. I do not want a divorce, Jackson. I don't. Didn't you get my message? Yeah, I got your message. Then what else do I have to do to prove to you that I want this marriage to work? What do you want from me? You want me to beg you? Fine, look at me. I am down on my knees. Please, please don't leave me. Please, don't give up on us. Please. Renee, get up. Renee, get up. No, Jackson, please. I don't care about that job. To hell with that career. - Please! - Renee... Please, Jackson, I love you. Jackson, please, I love you. Renee, listen to me. Jackson, I don't care about what happened in the past. I just need to make sure that you and I can move forward together now. If I could leave the past in the past, I would. I'm sorry. For what? What? - I love you. - But? I, um... I had an affair. I had a one-night stand, and she's pregnant. I'm sorry, I never meant for this to happen. Jessa's having your baby? Je... What are you talking about? What the hell does Jessa have to... what are you talking about? Just listen. Shut up. You shut up! Look, Renee... Let's try and figure out... whoa, whoa, Renee. Renee. I'm going to ask you one more time. Are you having an affair with Jessa? What? No. The one-night stand has nothing to do with Jessa. Why are you saying that? I need you to get out of this house. Babe, I'm-I'm sorry, I don't... Get out, Jackson. Get out! Jackson. Jackson! Damn it, Kingston. Damn you, Kingston. Why'd you do this to me? Why'd you do this to me? You son of a bitch, how could you do this to me? Damn you, Kingston. Damn you, you stupid, piece of, stupid... Damn you, Kingston. Baby, the heck did I do? What's going on? It's not you. It's not me. What? Okay. Well, I need to go fishing more. Baby, all right, listen. I stink. I've been on a boat all day, okay? - Let me just get in the shower. - No, no, homie. We about to take this off right now. Okay, so we do it real quick, all right? Remember, we've got to get over to Jackson's, all right? Where is Eric? I don't know. He's at home. And Jackson, is he at home too? Yeah. Why? What? Oh God, what? Are you screwing Jessa? Ow. No, I'm not screwing Jessa. Are you screwing Jessa? Baby, I'm not screwing Jessa, or any other woman, for that matter. What's going on? Wh-what's going on? What? Jessa sent this stupid DVD message to me, Renee, and Jamie, saying that she's having an affair with one of our husbands, and he's planning to leave one of us for her today. - What? - She packed up and everything. Okay, well, listen Aria, I don't know what's going on, - with Jessa... - Don't touch me. ...or anybody else. But, look... I'm not about to leave you for her or any other woman. What's wrong with you? I wish I could believe that, but with all three of you home and Jessa having no reason to lie, either one of you changed your mind or plans to dip out later. But one of you betrayed us, and I need to know if that's you. No, I told you, no, it's not. What? Every, every conversation you've had with Jessa, every time we spent time together, every look, every touch, that all seemed so innocent then. It's all suspect now, all of it. So wait a minute, not only do you think that I cheat on you, you think that I would cheat on you with your best friend? That's the husband that you married? Huh? You know what, if you think that, then you and I have some big problems. If you were planning to leave me for some other woman, then we have an even bigger problem. You can go to hell, that's the problem we got. Of course you would say that. Of course, Kingston. What else would you say? Yes, I was screwing Jessa and I was planning to leave you for her? Bitch, please. I'm your husband, all right? Watch your mouth, have some respect. Or what else, bitch? You know what, get yourself together, all right? Now when you're ready to have a grown conversation a-and control yourself like an adult, then we can have a conversation, all right? - We're talking about this now. - I'm not talking about it now. Kingston, we're talking about this right now. Kingston! Get back here! I didn't sleep a wink last night. I guess the last laugh is on me. My lover, oh, my lover, the man that I gave up so much for... ...he never showed up. He never even called. When I tried to call him, his phone just went straight to voicemail. I'm not heartless. I'm not. Those women were my friends. We shared many moments together. We have many memories. I know... I know the affair with me and lover was wrong, but... my husband's death was... It was so painful. The loneliness and the grief, it was unbearable. It was unbearable. And after our first night together, I just became consumed with him. He was like the light in my life of... of darkness... and... and gloom. He said all the right things, he did all the right things, he convinced me that he was willing to walk away from it all. I bet on love... and lost. Do I regret sending those taunting messages to my friends who are definitely now foes? I, uh... I don't know. It was spiteful... and childish. At the end of the day, my relationship with... I guess I should start referring to him by his government name. The relationship I had with... Did you have a good night? Did you... I didn't. Yeah, I know, okay. I know, it was. It was childish, I agree. So just... just come over here and spank me. Not a good time to go public? What are you saying, lover? Okay wait, so you're trying to tell me that everything you told me has just been a lie? You want to use me up and just throw me away? No, no, you're a liar. You're a liar, because you weren't even supposed to go back there. You were supposed to come straight here, to me. Oh please, you had no intentions of leaving her. A break? You want to take a break? I uh... I wouldn't do that if I were you, lover. Subtitles by explosiveskull
