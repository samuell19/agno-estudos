Pictures of branches trembling in the wind, absorbing the spirit from the earth, growing so gargantuan that I cannot see their tops. One day, in this very place, a tree I drew, did bloom, flowers bedecked its myriad branches. And all the flowers did in a moment fall. Overawed, I did not take up my brush... And now, the tree blooms no more. Nor does it sprout. Only a skeleton-Iike, dead tree remains. I coughed a Iittle and put away my paintbrush. Time passed and in this place, I began to paint again. The dead tree decays not, but radiates in silver tones. The brances grow both bigger and harder. SIowly does the tree change shape. A thousand years ago, in this very place, I alone have waited for the pre-destined moment to come again. AII I have done, is wait. Await the creation of my Iast painting. What is it? A fish. How did you get it? I found it. You must set it free. What are you doing? I am waiting. Waiting for what? From the sky... petals shall rain A Iong, Iong time ago, in a far away Iand, There was a small village deep in the forest. The villagers often hunted in the forest, gathering nuts, making houses and all the while singing, reciting poems, or singing Iullabies. Food was freely offered to passing travellers, and each day was Iived in bliss. As the sun set, fireplaces were Iit, time for a warm rest. Into sleep they went quietly. But one night, while all slept, a Iow, menacing growl came from the edge of the forest. Each day, it grew Iouder. Chilrden could not play outside. Men could not go hunting. The villagers were frightened and convened a meeting. The village elder spoke: "A mountain-sized monster Iives at the edge of our village. " "Surely it will come here in search of food. " "It will tear apart, both the sky and the earth, " "the sun shall burn and all will be destroyed. " The villagers trembled at these words. The bravest of all young men, did volunteer himself. "I shall destroy the monster! " "I will save the village and the forest!" Carrying all the village's hopes and anxieties, the young man entered the forest. Are you going again today? Can I take this? What will you do with it? I will take it with me. What are you painting? Do you always paint here? Yes, but never a picture do I finish. This little girl paints in my place. Why aren't you painting? There is one I must see before I can paint. Until it is revealed, I am unable to paint. Hence I sit here everyday, awaiting it's arrival. The wind has risen. Are you not cold? It's getting dark. I'll go home now. Don't be late. Flowers aren't falling... Today, again, it is not to be... Let him sleep. What is this? What happened? A car ran over it. Help me make a grave? Yes, I shall. As soon as I get a little better. It is like the scales of a reptile, or the bark of a tree. Rusty steel, smells like blood. It also gives off its own warmth. Feel it. When a creature dies, it becomes cold. But, cold steel instead, takes warmth. Shouldn't I think that all around me is warm? Come with me. "I came to destroy you. " Why? "You will destroy the forest. " "And all within it. " So said the young man. For a while the monster quietly pondered. "They declared I would destroy everything. " "I will walk atop your village and kill all within. " "Then call to the moon. " "AII the Ieaves from the trees I shall blow away. " "AII I wanted was to Iive in peace. " "But far too big in body, " "to Iive along side you humans. " At this, the young man withdrew his bow. He was at a Ioss what to do. The monster demanded to be slain. "But after my death use my body well. " "My body is harder than the stones. " "Make from it many strong houses and bridges. " So saying, he slowly closed his eyes. The young man carried off a whisker from the monster, back to his village. The villagers warmly welcomed him. AII, to a man, praised his prowess. But, he was not happy at all. He was even a Iittle sad. Flowers aren't falling... Today, again, it is not to be... Will you go again tomorrow? Well... But, maybe I cannot go anymore. At last, flowers fall. Produced & Directed by Kanji Nakajima
