(eerie music) (camera shutter snapping) - Arny, where are you? (tires screeching) Well, Lake Lochland doesn't do late. You've got five minutes. - I'd say don't worry about it, Kate, Scott may be getting out today. - [Kate] Oh, that's right. Oh my god, I gotta to call Abigail. - Who's Abigail? - The caretaker for your house. - I'm so clueless. - That's why you have me in your life, babe. (phone vibrating) Abigail, how's the house looking? - It's looking. - Have you ordered the curtains yet? - It hasn't come in yet. - Okay, I need you to make sure the curtains come in. I need the house to look spic-and-span. - Well I'm kinda in the middle of something. - [Kate] But... - But what? - Listen, I've got to go. Just make sure the curtains get in. Make sure the house looks good, alright? Make sure you do that for me. - Well, I can't, Kate. - Hi, yes, Abigail? Hi, it's Lake Lochland. - Oh I'm in trouble. - No, no, no, no, no, no. You're fine. - Hi, you must be Kate. - Yeah, I'm Kate. - Hi, it's great to see you, we're very excited. - Yeah, what is this? - This is going to be the centerpiece and we're probably going to shoot over there. - Okay, but what's inside? - Look, I don't need you to worry about the furniture or the drapes or any of that, okay? My brother's review is coming up today and he might be getting out. - Oh, is he going to stay here? Is that what the big rush is about? - Oh, no. I doubt he wants to be in that house any more than I do. It's his stuff from childhood, though. I think he might want those. - Okay, I'll dig around. - Just don't go in the basement, okay? - The door to the basement is locked. - Good, let's keep it that way. Thank you. - I'm gonna go over here-- - Okay. - [Arny] And the way the light's gonna shoot is gonna really make the whole project-- - What's inside the box, though? - Oh it's just a mirror, but it's very important and integral-- - Okay, okay. - To the way I see this coming through. - Arny, Arny, Arny, I need you to listen. - [Arny] Yeah. - We can't have mirrors in this shoot so you need to figure something else out, okay? - You must be kidding me, you can't have mirrors? (doorknob rattling) (sighing) You can't have mirrors? - Yeah, we cannot have mirrors. - What's the problem? - I'm sorry. Is there any other-- - But it's going to be the centerpiece of everything. I've thought this through in my head. - I understand that, but we-- - She's gonna look fantastic. - I understand that, but-- - I promise she's-- - No, no, no, no, don't touch me. - [Lake] What is going on here? - Kate is trying to ruin our shoot, Miss Lochland. - No mirrors, it's in the contract. - There's nothing in the contract. - Is that a mirror? - Jan? - There's no mention of mirrors in the contract. - Do it in post. - Do it in post? Are you kidding me? PCs can't do that, they're worlds apart. - Do it in post, or we walk. - Okay, do you want a bump in fee? Hey, Lake. - Look-- - Miss Lochland, are you are really walking away from this? - [Kate] Hey, hey, don't talk to my client. - Listen, I'm Arny Allen and there is a whole slew of models waiting in line who would kill to be a part of this shoot and would make your kennel run up to the barking places, you know what I'm saying? - And guess what, none of them are Lake Lochland. And you just blew your chance to work with her, okay? And if I get an ill word of this in the press, your career will be over. Now, now babe, I got your back. - You always do, Kate. - Congratulations, Mr. Allen. You've just been fucked by a supermodel. (laughing) (tense music) - How does it feel seeing her in magazines and commercials? - She grew up to fame and fortune. Not me. - There's still anger in you. I don't think you're ready for today. - We'll find out soon enough, Dr. Haddy. - Scott, we're ready for you. - Remember, there's no shame in saying you're not ready for this. - Yeah, but you won't hear that from me, Dr. Haddy. - Sorry about losing the gig today, Kate. - No, you're not. - I know I'm difficult. - I've never noticed it. (laughing) Oh, don't leave the cold cream on too long. You know how it blocks your pores. - But it makes such a soothing face mask. - You're old school. You want that oxy facial when I get back? - Ooh yes and a lip scrub. Oh wait, you're leaving? - Yeah, to get us paid for the day. - What? - You think I'm going to let that Scottish egomaniac put his hands on me and then stiff us? Not this girl. - You're my fight song, Kate. - Room covered up okay? - It's perfect. - Alright, I'll see you later. - Okay. - It's a big day for you, Scott. I'm sure you must be nervous. - I think I'm ready. I'm ready for it. (chuckling) - Do you always feel the need to please people? - People with Shared Delusional Disorder often feel the need to please others. - Again, I ask Scott, do you feel the need to please people? - Yes, I guess I do. But isn't that also a sign of being a nice person? Maybe we're all under some shared delusion that we actually like each other and want to do right by each other, but I like to think I've made real friendships, you know, even stuck in here. - You know, there really wasn't no mention of mirrors in the contract. In fact, they specifically requested a mirror box shoot after seeing my work. - Not my problem. Keep your hands to yourself next time. We'll call this even. - What a cunt. - Publicists. We can't shoot them. - So, Lake Lochland's the cunt. (chuckling) - No argument there. - I think you should be the famous one, Arny. - We have a lead on a gig that will make you famous beyond belief. (unsettling music) (chuckling) - And finally, is there anything else you'd like to say? - Well, I've gone from a terrified little kid who believed in ghosts to a 21 year old young man who regrets the delusions that led to the death of his parents. Every day I've had to live with what I did and I'm going to have to keep living with that for the rest of my life. Should I be released? Some people would say no. They think not. But I hope I am released so I can prove to them and prove to the world and I can prove to myself that I was just a mixed-up little kid and not some monster deserving of life in a cage. You asked me if I was scared? Yeah, I mean of course. Who wouldn't be scared of going out into the world after after so long. - You realize, by letting Scott go, we're going against the recommendations of his doctors, his nurses, and his peers. - You heard his answers, he's ready. - Maybe, maybe. - Look, we only have so much room in here. We've got to let some of the close calls go. - Yeah but I don't know. - Who would you choose to let go over him? - I don't know, Liz, I don't feel great about this. - How long do we have to wait? - I have no idea. - Scott. It's against my better judgment, but we've decided to authorize your release. - [Scott] Really? - We just have a little bit of paperwork to do, but there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to go today. Do you have anyone to pick you up? - [Scott] My sister. - Okay, we'll let her know. (dramatic music) (laughing) - Thank you, Dr. Haddy. Thank you so much. - Boom baby! Oh, hey, sorry. - Oh no, no, it's fine. I should get up anyway. - [Kate] You want me to prep the shower? - That would be great. - Okay. (unsettling music) Lake, the tape's not sticking. Do you still want to take that shower? - [Lake] Yeah, do that fog trick of yours. - Absolutely (shrieking) Lake, Lake, what, what is it? What happened? - Scott's getting out. (shrieking) (laughing) - Oh my god, I'm so happy for you. That's awesome, oh my god, oh my god, that's so exciting. I wish I could go with you, but Kevin is actually on his way out here right now. So I'm gonna meet him for dinner and maybe a quickie in the car before we head back to the city. (suspenseful music) Nothin' wrong with that. (man chuckling maniacally) - I didn't say anything. (chuckling) - Alright, so, you've got the room until the morning. I put your towels in the dresser. Is there anything else you need before I head out? - No, I am all good here. - Okay. - And you know what, why don't you bring Kevin back here instead of to the back of your car? I'll just drive myself back. - Are you sure? - Yeah, it's all you Mama. - Oh my gosh Lake, you're such a sweetheart. - Have fun tonight. (suspenseful music) (thudding) (gasping) (unnerving music) - Hello, lollipop. (gasping) You look a little bit knackered, fancy a kip? (grunting) (strained gasping) No! (door banging) (glass shattering) (sobbing) * There is a house deep in the woods * * She is beautiful * I faced hell and high water * But I will never face them alone * * I am never alone * There is no such thing * The wicked clever watch my back * * And I have an angel by my side * * But hell burns with so many colors * * I almost wish everyone could see * * And this is terrible, but it's not so bad * * And the worst thought that ever crossed my mind * * Is the best that I've ever had * * And you're all just trying to help * * And believe 999 steps till you let me know * * There's no such thing as low * There's no such thing I worry for you out there. - More than you worry about me in here? - In here I can do things. Out there, I'm limited. The world is a scary place. - Yeah, but at least I'm not scared of mirrors anymore. Maybe someday you could write a case study about me. Help others with shared delusional disorder. You've sure done okay by me. (laughing) - You know I had to make an excuse to come see you. - Oh yeah? - Uh huh. - We got a couple of continuances that I wouldn't normally grab. - Uh huh. - Now don't you go saying something about that, Miss PR lady. (unsettling music) (laughing) I missed you. - I missed you too. - Oh really? - Uh huh, yeah. (clanging) Klutz. (gasping) - [Lake] Kate? - Lake? Lake? - I thought she was gone - Please help me. - Lake. - I thought she was gone? - Oh my god. (unsettling music) Lake, what happened? Oh my god, oh my god. - I'm gonna call 911. - No, no don't do that. - Oh, we've got to get you to the hospital, baby. - No, no hospitals. - Oh my god. Oh, you need a doctor, oh my god. - There's a lot of blood in here. I should call somebody, I'm calling an-- - No, I said, no, and close that door. - Stop, stop, stop, okay? Okay, we've got to figure this out, oh my god. - What is there to figure out? Where is she-- - Lake, wait. (door banging) - What in the hell? Why didn't she let me call? - Doctor, I don't know if I want to stay with my sister. - Well, there's always the option of the halfway house-- - No, I mean, I do want to see her, but I just... I don't. What she did to me-- - Is not all that uncommon. Yes, your case was extreme, but there's always a dominant sibling in every sibling relationship. And your anger is justified, it's just, it's also a way to project blame. - If I let it ride, I'm soft. If I stay bitter I'm fragile. - You're not fragile, Scott. It's just even iron can break under too much strain. (knocking on door) - Knock, knock. - Come in. (door creaking open) - Scott, your sister is here. It's time to go. - Give me, give me one minute. Well, I guess, this is it. - [Haddy] I'm pulling for you. - I'll stay in touch. - It's a big world out there and you have very little experience with it. - Well I guess here's only one way to cure that problem. (unsettling dramatic music) (sighing) - Okay, good news. I just heard from Lake. She's okay, she's with her brother. The maids are going to clean the room so I don't think TMZ's gonna get a hold of this so we are good to go. - TMZ. I can't believe you are all more concerned about TMZ than making sure that girl is really okay. - Kevin, this is my job, I know what I'm doing, okay? - I know that, I know it's your job, but what I don't understand is-- - Kevin, I got this, okay? Okay? - Sweet pea, I'm not trying to make you mad. I'm just concerned about you, okay? I love you. - I love you, too. (suspenseful music) (speaking in a foreign language) (screaming) - So Jan and Charlie have identified another photographer? - [Elizabeth] I picked him out. And I hired him to photograph the boy's sister. - Lake Lochland. - You know, this is a good thing. I've arranged for Scott's release. And we can finally get revenge on that little shit who killed Bernie. - And do I still have to play wife to Gideon? - Mere. I know this is hard for you. But you're the best actress I know. It's time for you to get back into character. (unsettling music) - Hey, what gives? - [Charlie] We walk from here. - Hey, you're joking? (chuckling) What about my equipment? - You won't need it. (eerie music) (chuckling) (dramatic eerie music) Out, out, brief candle. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, who struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. - It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. (clapping) (chuckling) - The Scottish play. You're making me homesick. - You know Macbeth. That's a good start. - Did Mackers himself make this camera? It sure looks old enough. (chuckling) - Hello, I am Elizabeth. Jan and Charlie told me that you were a great photographer who's lost his way. - That sounds a little strong to me. - Strength of will is what you'll need to complete this project. And if you are able to capture the spirit of the piece, your career and life will never be the same. - That I am ready to try. - [Gideon] I can't believe she gave me the questions in advance. (sighing) Why does everything have to be so scripted? - Relax Gideon. Just speak from your heart. Did you ever in your wildest dreams, think that you would reach this many people with your soul energy? - Reaching them through a television show? I doubt I'll reach a single person tonight. - We are back with Gideon Ravenwood and Mere Spiegel to talk about their new eight step program to harness the power of soul energy. Tell us, what is soul energy? - Well quite simply, it's the energy of life that is so strong it carries your essence to the afterlife via your silver cord. - Have you ever felt connected to someone so strongly you can feel their presence in a room at a party? You don't even have to be looking at them, but you know exactly where they are, who they're with, what they're eating or drinking. - I wish, do you have his number? (chuckling) (moaning) (phone ringing musically) - Leave it. - Oh, it could be Lake. - Just a telemarketer. (chuckling) What're you doing? - You're good, but you're not that good. Kate Foster. - [Gideon On TV] Soul energy, dig it. - What? Really? No, no, no, no, okay. No, I'll handle it. No, I'll send someone over to handle it. Yeah, okay, alright, thank you. (sighing) Fuckety fuck. - What was that? - That was the hotel. The staff is scared to enter the room. - So can you blame them? I mean that hotel looked like a crime scene, baby. - I know. I gotta call Abigail. - Right now? - Yeah. - It's your silver cord of energy. And when intertwined with another being, it becomes so strong, that it makes a lightning bolt seem like a flash of a ladyfinger. - [Interviewer] So is love a form a soul energy? - Oh, absolutely. - It is one of its most powerful forms. - [Interviewer] What's the secret to gathering this power? - Silver. Now the metal already has many practical uses and applications, but with Gideon's eight step program you can unlock its magical powers as well. - And it's simple, it starts with a photo. (phone vibrating) - Hello? - Abby, I need you to get to the Green Sward Hotel and clean a room for me. I'll text you the address. - I'm off today, remember? - Okay, well I need you to do this now. - When is cleaning house ever an emergency? - When a hotel bathroom is covered with blood and the staff is afraid to enter the room to clean it because they think it's haunted. That's when. - Haunted? - Oh my god, I cannot let the press get a hold of this. - You know what, I'll do it. And I won't even need the hush money. (unsettling music) - Mm-hm. We are ready to shoot. - No, Arny, use the Voidfinder. (suspenseful music) (camera shutter snapping) (screaming) - [Elizabeth] The Voidfinder recognizes when a soul is captured in a piece. (gasping) Your composition must be very far from that. - If you want my best work, let me use my own fucking equipment. - Until you master the Voidfinder you'll never be able to use another camera again. Oh. (chuckling) (keys on phone clicking) - So you're a mean one, Mr. Ghosty? (knocking) Say... (knocking) - Suddenly a wild inch worm appeared. (chuckling) You remember when we used to do that out in the yard and Mom would get so mad because we would get grass stains all over? - Yeah. (chuckling) I'm glad you're feeling better. - Yeah, now that you're home. - Home, it's amazing. This is amazing. Seeing all these people out and about like this. Living free. Living in their homes. And now I'm home. This is a really nice place you have here. - Thanks. - Welcome. - Thanks. - Thank you, (chuckling) thanks for the sandwiches. - Oh, yeah, no problem. I figured you would be hungry. - They didn't have good turkey at the hospital. (laughing) 13 years of shitty turkey. - Oh and I have different clothes for you. - [Scott] Clothes? - We had to guess at the sizes and Kate did the shopping. And the only point of reference that she had was an old picture of you from your boy scout camping trip. So cargo pants. (laughing) Here you go, boy scout. (laughing) For all your assorted carrying purposes. - I can put these sandwiches in there. - Yeah, perfect. Like that time you filled all your pockets with tater tots. - [Scott] Oh, yeah. (chuckling) - Tot pockets. - Tot pockets. - I give up, I quit. - You only get one chance at this, Arny. I suggest you find more resolve. - It's making me blind! And it doesn't like one god damn fucking thing I'm doing with those mannequins. (punch thumping) (unsettling music) - Ooh, violence, it seemed to like that. - Spirit show yourself, spirit reveal, spirit come to me, so I know you are real. (whooshing) Ah, hello, are you alone or do you have a companion? (whooshing) Well, hello, friends. It's so nice to meet you. - Did you think it was a maiden ghost haunting your toilet? (laughing maniacally) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (panting) No, no, no, no. You can't get away that easily. (laughing maniacally) (suspenseful music) (panting) (gasping) Now where do you think you're going? Nowhere. (suspenseful music) (unsettling music) (camera shutter snapping) (screaming) - Come on, Arny, you're so close. - [Arny] It only wants more death. - Perhaps you should give it what it wants. - Silence, Jan, or you'll be the one we're snapping pictures of instead of the mannequins. (laughing) - Knives. Knives. I need two knives. (unsettling music) (camera shutter snapping) (laughing maniacally) (unnerving music) (camera shutter snapping) (camera shutter snapping) (dramatic music) - Aw, they fit, good. - Yeah. It has cool pockets. - Really. - I can fit so many of these in there. - I can, I can see that. You were serious about the sandwiches. (laughing) - Yeah, I'd do this in the hospital all the time every day. - [Lake] Oh. - They didn't let us eat a whole lot. - Oh, I almost forgot. These are for you. It's nothing fancy, but it runs and it will get you where you need to go. And now you have a phone for emergencies, my number and Kate's number is in here already. It's just stuff that you'll need, just basics. - What is this? - It's just-- - What am I going to do with that? - You can get your license and live your life. - No, this is-- (groaning) This has got to stop. - What, I'm just trying to help. - Okay, okay then the food and the sandwiches and the clothes, that's one thing, but a car? No, no! Stop, stop. - I'm sorry. - No, no, okay. If we are going to be, if I'm going to do this, if I'm gonna live out here, free and home, if we're going to be a normal brother and sister, have a normal fucking relationship, I have to be my own person, okay? I can't let you manipulate me anymore. I can't be under your spell. I can't do it ever again. - I'm not trying to manipulate you, I'm just trying to help. - Even if you aren't trying to. I can't do it. Dr. Haddy helped me, okay? He helped me all these three years, these... He helped me make sense of everything, okay? He brought me through some really, really dark times. He cured me of those delusions. - Delusions? - Yes, those delusions. - Scott, those weren't delusions. And they have haunted me every day since you left. - Nobody's blaming you, okay Lake? - [Lake] Why would anybody blame me? - Because you were, we were kids, okay? You had an active imagination. It's called shared delusional disorder and I fell victim to it, just as much as you did. - Victim? - Mr. Frazier. The ghost you made up that was, that you thought was possessing Dad. - Scotty, I didn't make him up. It was you who showed Mr. Frazier to me. (unnerving music) (unsettling music) Who's that? - Mr. Frazier. Do you believe in magic? I can't read it, can you? I think it says something that has to do with Mom and Dad. - What do we do? - Maybe we can fix them. (gasping) - [Lake] Scotty, Scott, wait. - Come to bed, sweet pea. - I can't. I'm waiting for Abigail to call me. She said she would when she was done. - I didn't say, sleep. - No, you didn't. Alright come on. - Now that's more like it. (chuckling) - Oh, wait, hold on, I forgot my phone. - [Kevin] I'll get it, I'll get it, go ahead. (tense music) (sighing) - [Answering Machine] You have one new message. Press one for new message. - [Bell] Dr. Skinner. This is Judge Bell. I am surprised that you released Scott Lochland, yesterday. By all accounts by the doctors and staff there, Scott Lochland is a very disturbed young man. I've sent over a packet asking for a report on your reasoning in this matter. I expect something on my desk by the day after tomorrow. Good day. (knocking on door) - Scott. - Miss Lochland? - Yes. - I'm Abigail. I'm the caretaker for your house. May I come in? (tense music) (sighing) (upbeat music) * Hey - Yes, yes, sweetheart. Yes, alright, hold on. - Byron, that fan is messing up my hair. - Okay and that's my problem because I mean I've got 99 problems and your hair's not one. Oh my god, really? (groaning) - Uh-oh. Looks like things aren't going well here without me. - You have some nerve. You blew the Lake Lochland shoot yesterday and then you come in here two hours late. Who was she this time, Arny? - Don't ask. Anyway What seems to be the problem here? - Okay, so I can't get the right depth of field with APS or full frame. I've switched out every camera, every lens. (groaning) I'm about to put this up on eBay and buy a Polaroid. - Dude, no need to be so dramatic, just let me take a look. - I thought you'd never ask. (groaning) - Alright. (camera shutter snapping) - See, told you it was a clusterfuck. - Yeah. (chuckling) Alright, come on. (unsettling music) - Any day now. Yeah. (camera shutter snapping) No, no, no, no, it's, it's not you, it's the camera. - Yeah, yeah. I can't. - Wait what's wrong? - We need to talk. - Alright. - Key information was left out of Scott Lochland's case file. I have Judge Bell crawling up my ass right now for answers. There's going to be a formal review on this. I do not feel good about this. I'm gonna tell the truth. - Have a seat. Look, I was sent the same file that you were. Here, let me show you. There. Do you see any discrepancies? - This one right here. - Really? - [Kent] Scott's disassociates disorder has been left out of this one. - Show me. - Right here. Oh no, what are you doing? - Shh. Just let it happen. Mommy's got plans for you. (dramatic music) - What happened to you? - What do you mean? - Yesterday. Why was the blood all over the hotel room? - How did you-- - Kate sent me to clean. - She didn't tell you? - I don't think she knew. I saw him Lake. The man with the face. Who is he? (sighing) - [Kate] What? (sighing) (phone vibrating) - Hello. - Hey, Pretty Girl. I haven't checked my messages yet. Kevin fucked with my phone last night. What's up? - Abigail is here actually. - What, why? - It's best you stay out of this Kate, okay? - Fuck that. I'm on my way over. - Okay, she's on her way over. - Want some tea? - Haddy, I'm at the house. - Why are you back there there? - I am. - Leave, it's dangerous for you there. - I have to know why I killed them. I have to know why I killed my parents. - [Haddy] No, Scott, listen to me. (dramatic music) - Hey, Mama. - What is going on? - Grab a seat and I'll tell you. - Hi boss. (doorknob rattling) - Okay, the reason I won't look in mirrors goes back to the time from before my parents died. My father was possessed and Scott knew it. He convinced me, too. We called the demon, Mr. Frazier, and it wanted to kill us, both of us. We told our mother about it, but she seemed under his spell. Mr. Frazier had Dad build a shrine in the basement. To what I have no idea. The shrine had a mirror that looked like a gate or a portal to god knows where. And an altar. The altar was for us. (dramatic eerie music) (steps creaking) - Demons, human sacrifice? Are you, are you sure? - She's sure. I've seen Mr. Frazier. He tried to kill me last night. He appeared in the hotel. In the bathroom mirror. He's real. - I always thought-- - That I was crazy. - Confused, scared, phobic, not crazy. I knew you too well. Or at least I thought I did. (creaking) - Well, now you know everything. There's nothing left to learn. - Nobody believes in demons until they actually see one. - There's everything to learn. How did you and your brother escape? (sighing) - I didn't tell you this so you could get involved. I told you this so you could run away. - Not in a million. You've had to live with this threat for far too long. And I'm not going to let this Mr. Frazier hurt you ever again. Even if it means I have to shatter every mirror in the whole world. - Can anybody spare a hammer? (eerie music) (doorknob rattling) - If Scott was the one to sniff out Mr. Frazier, then what was it that convinced you to believe that he even existed? - I could see him in the mirror whispering in my dad's ear. (sighing) - So did Mr. Frazier possess your father or was he more like a ghost? - Like I know. My mom did give me a prayer written in Hebrew and taught me how to read it. (sighing) Called the Yatsa. I could still recite if from memory I bet. I think it's an exorcism. I don't know, whatever it is, it saved me and my brother. - It looks like it's just one page. Like it's cut off at the bottom or something. Maybe there's more to the prayer. - She gave this to me right before Mr. Frazier appeared. Then she.... - Then she what? - She stopped talking to us. (sighing) - Kate, can you please pick up the phone? I said I'm sorry, I was not try-- Look, I don't have a lot of time to do the texting thing. (chattering) - Dr. Harris, hi. Thank you for taking the time to meet with us. - My pleasure, I'm happy to share my knowledge. - Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? - Of course, how can I help you? - You read Hebrew, is that correct? - Of course. - Well, we have this prayer and we want to know its origins and if there is anything more to it. Would you mind taking a look? - Yeah. Well, it's old, authentic. I don't know what kind of skin, it's not sheep, or goat. But, I'd like to study it. How did you come by this? - My mother gave it to me. It's called the Yatsa. She taught me to read it, too. Every word. I'm Lake Lochland by the way. Yatsa means to go, so is this like a-- - Oh, Yatsa has many meanings in the Hebrew language. It means both coming and going. - Is that how you read it? - Yeah. - I remember reading it the other way. - You read it backwards? - I guess so. - Huh. (speaking in a foreign language) I'm sorry, Miss. I don't think I can help you. - Wait, what? Dr. Harris, what is it? Dr. Harris, what's scaring you? - [Lake] I think we know the answer to that already. - Well, I guess, I don't know, what should we do? (dramatic music) - Would you like to see anything in the case? - Yes, Kevin? I can't, I can't right now. I'm with Lake. We're in the middle of something. - Hey, look, I'm really sorry about this morning. But if you allow me, I would like to make it up to you with dinner tonight? - I wish I could, but I can't. (electronic beeping) - Hello? (engine revving) (thudding) - I know someone we can call. (eerie dramatic music) - This is ridiculous. Why don't we just ring the doorbell? - I have a restraining order. - What? - [Abigail] There he is. - What's he doing? - Eating the sun. - What? - Yeah, you can derive nutrients from it. Vitamin A, vitamin D. Some people get so good at it they no longer have to eat. I've tried it. - Okay. - Go. Mere isn't around. He might be reasonable. - Okay let's go - This is trespassing, you know. - We're sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gideon, we need your help. - I'm sure you do, but what I don't understand is how can you help me? - Elizabeth, she's here. - Who is where? - The sister is here at Gideon's. - [Elizabeth] Lake Lochland is at your house? - What do you want me to do? - I'm Lake Lochland. If you help us, I could always go on your show and do a bit about how I believe in Soul Energy and all that. People might listen to me if they recognize me. - She cannot talk to Gideon. - Too late for that. - You have my attention. - We're trying to figure out what this spell means. - Can you kill her? - Not without witnesses. Look at that. Abigail is violating her restraining order. Get Jan and Charlie over here, I have a plan. - Well, you see, what you have here is a spell of summoning not of banishment. Yes, it's right here. - Well then who does it summon? - It really doesn't say. - [Lake] Maybe that's in the missing part. - No, there's no missing part. It calls on a spirit, but it doesn't mention a name. - Gideon, Gideon, she's spying on me again. Abigail, we've called the cops. You'll never get away with this. (muffled gasping) (suspenseful music) - You're ruined, you're ruined. You're ruined, you're ruined, you're ruined, you're fucking ruined! - Hello. - [Arny] Who are you? - I'm your new patron. - You're the one behind the camera. - No, you are. - I mean, you're the guy who made the camera. - No again, but it was made for me. - Then you know I'm ruined. Some fucking patron you are. - Oh please, you're not ruined. - How can you say that? You've stolen my everything, my art, my passion. - Those lewd contributions to the mundane that you burned in your rubbish bin? Stop massaging your loins and do some real work. - Who are you? - I've told you already. - Then what's your name? I want your name. - Well, those Lochland kids called me, Mr. Frazier. So I guess that's as good as any. - You may think you're my patron, but I definitely am not your photographer. So why don't you just leave? - Oh, I could do that. But then I wouldn't be the villain in all this, would I? Not like mankind. Those precocious apes that bloat the Earth with seven billion of their kind and then call those that cure their diseases and prolong their life spans the good guys. (chuckling) If you ask me, it's those that do the killing that are the true heroes of society. But you imprison and torture the true virtuosos in the art of killing, the murderers. The ones that take a life for no other reason than they just want a life to be taken. There's such poetry in that. Poe knew that. But modern artists quoth the Raven no more. - [Curtis] Don't worry, death will find you. - What? - Death, I said death will find you. - What the shit, bro? - No need to get hasty, man. I mean, Death finds us all. - What the hell, man? Here ya go. Fuck it. (chuckling) - What an appalling lack of silver. Shit. (coin clanging) I got something for you, come here. Here ya go. - [Scott] What the fuck is this? - Now that's a real quarter. Made of mostly silver. I say about-- (sniffing) Circa 1960. - What the fuck I need this for? - It's not for you, brotha. It's for the boatman. - The boatman? - You don't know the boatman? The boatman is the man, or the spirit they might say, that comes for you when you die. The boatman comin', coming for you tonight. - Whatever man, you know, fuck you. (banging on wall) (chuckling) - He's comin' for ya Scotty. - [Claire] Byron told me you weren't feeling well, today. Anything I can do? - Poor baby. - No, I just want to be left alone. - [Claire] Suit yourself, you know my number. - And now you know mine. (chuckling) - Now those opportunities are not going to come your way for very much longer. Are you sure you don't want to chase after them for one last hoorah? - Why? You just want me to murder them. - What did you just say? - Nothing, man. I didn't say anything. - Well, Arny, I think it's time you settle up and go home. - [Arny] What, a guy can't a guy talk to himself? - Not in my bar. Go home, get some sleep, and I'll forget what you said. - I wish I could forget. - I doubt that works. - Have another one? - What did you do? - I didn't do anything, pal. - I mean them, try this one. - Oh, an exercise in futility. - Do you have any cash? - [Arny] No, I don't have anything. - You're running an $80 tab. - That I can't pay. Call the cops? - Don't worry, Arny, this one's on me. (glass shattering) - Oh, fuck. (thumping) - [Frazier] Hey, leave. I'll take care of this mess. (muffled talking on police radio) - Anything else? - [Autumn] That's it, darling. (unnerving music) - [Kevin] Now what? - [Emanuel] Hey Autumn, can you buzz me in? - Sure thing, sweet tits. Hey, Emanuel, can you be so kind as to go to the property room for me and get the bags for Kate Foster and Lake Lochland, please? - I got you. (phone dialing beeping) (phone vibrating) (text messages dinging) - I can explain. - Explain what? You were with Lake. Do you love me? - Yes, of course, I love you. - Kate, do you really love me? - Hey, girls, you forgot your stuff. (crying) - [Kevin] Will you marry me? - Yes. - Yes, yes? - Yes. Of course, I'll marry you. Oh my god. - This is the nicest ring that I could find. (laughing) Now, can we please get out of this place and go celebrate? - I can't. - What? - Is Abigail still in lock up? - Who? - Abigail, I don't know her last name. Kate? - Yes, hon? - What's Abigail's last name? - Clayton. - Clayton, Abigail Clayton. - There's no Abigail Clayton in lockup. - What? No, that can't be right. She was arrested with us. - Abigail's restraining order is what got us locked up here in the first place. - Uh-uh, says here drunk and disorderly. (door creaking) (coughing) (crying) (door clanging shut) - What day is it. (coughing) What day is it? - Who are you? - [Kent] I'm Kent. (groaning) - It's Thursday. - [Kent] What time? (coughing) - I don't know, midnight maybe? - Oh my god, 12 hours. - [Abigail] What? - 12 hours, I've been in here 12 hours. (coughing) - What do they want from us? (distant arguing) - I'll whoop your ass-- (gun firing) - [Arny] Fuck. (camera shutter snapping) (unsettling music) - Do you always use your phone to make works of art? (woman screaming) Now take out your camera and go shoot this properly, or I'll kill another family. (woman screaming) (chuckling) (dog barking) (suspenseful music) (camera shutter snapping) (fun firing) (slow rock music) (fun firing) Brilliant. - More. (chuckling) - Oh, that was child's play, Arny. The Voidfinder is the tool for this trade. - When did they take you? Listen, Abigail. I realize, you don't trust anybody right now, but we need to see if there's a connection between the two of us. - You first. - I had an issue with a colleague of mine over a patient. - Name? - Elizabeth Ross. (coughing) She withheld key information from me on a case. I confronted her about it. Next thing you know (coughing) I'm waking up here. (coughing) - The patient's name? - [Kent] Scott Lochland. - Yeah, yeah that's Lake Lochland's brother. What was missing? - For starters, that he was a paranoid schizophrenic. He hallucinated his own psychotherapist. I think he called him Dr. Haddy. Yeah, crazy because Dr. Haddy, his imaginary doctor, is the only one he would allow to treat him. (unnerving music) (panting) - [Scott] Where are you, huh, where are you? - [Haddy] We need to talk. - I just met this homeless guy. He said I was gonna die tonight. - I warned you I cannot protect you out here. - So you believe him? - Regardless this will be the last night you see me. - What? No, Doctor, I need you here. There's so much I don't know, there's so much I need to learn about myself, about my family, about that night. - And if I go, you may have a chance. - How can you say that? You're my doctor. - You're the only one that can see me, Scott. - No. No. - It's true. - No, that's impossible. I didn't make you up. Not like I made up Mr. Frazier. - You didn't make up Mr. Frazier, he is very real. - No, stop saying that! - But before I go, cover the mirrors. He's gonna hurt you. He needs to hurt you. And when I'm gone he'll be back, but at least you'll be able to see him coming. - [Scott] No. - Are you sure you want to leave me right now? - Kevin, I'm not leaving you. - Can you close that door for a second, please? This is bullshit. I just proposed to you at a fucking police station. I'm a judge. Do you know how embarrassing that was? Do you know how hard that proposal was for me to make in the first place? - [Kate] Yes. - And you're getting ready to get up right now and leave? - [Kate] Yes, I know, I know and I'm sorry. - Sorry's not cutting it for me right now, Kate. - Kevin. - What? - We're in a situation right now and I-- - You're-- - Hear me out. I need to handle this, okay? Something really serious is going on and I need to help Lake. - Lake, Lake? It's Lake. Ever since I've been here, it's Lake. Everything, Lake, Lake, Lake, Lake. - Okay, well that's because I'm her publicist, Kevin. - But don't bring your job into this right now. - But this is my job though. - You've been having me deal with this for the whole time I've been here. I came here to see you. I barely got to spend any time with you. You've been spending all your time with her. I don't understand this. - I can't tell you the situation that we're in right now because you wouldn't even believe it if I did. - Is she insane? - No, she's not insane. We're in a situation. I can't explain it right now. - Then you need to-- - Now Abigail is missing okay? And I need to find her. - Come with me. - [Kent] Who are you, what do you want with me? (thudding) - Stop. - Get the fuck up, now. (crying) - Stop, stop. I'll come. Just stop, stop. (door clanging) - Is this your vision, Arny? - It needs more, don't you think? We're using our Voidfinder on this one. We shouldn't disappoint our benefactor. - You're the artist. - He seems a bit of a stuffed shirt. See if that helps any. - Then let's give him a Sicilian necktie. (laughing) (groaning) (chuckling) - I've always wondered with these things if the person dies from bleeding out or from suffocating. - Let's hope it's the latter, well the piece could use a touch of blue. Who's next? - Maybe I can help, as a judge. - No, I don't think you can. We just got arrested for a drunk and disorderly. We are not drunk, or disordered, okay? - Okay, I'm a judge I'll call somebody and have it cleared up. - If you want to call someone, find Abigail for me. - Okay, and? - There is no and, that's it. I don't want you involved, Kevin. - Kate, you are my fiance. - No, I don't want you involved. - I'm not going to just-- - I don't want you to get hurt. - Okay, now you're starting to freak me out. - Just trust me on this, okay? I'll take care of it and we'll go to dinner and I'll call you afterwards and we'll celebrate. I just, I just, let me take care of it, okay? Just find Abigail for me. - I-- (door slamming) I love you. (dramatic music) - Hey, whoa, are you okay? - It's Kevin. It'll be okay, I'll be okay. - [Lake] Oh, Scott texted, he said he's back at the apartment. - I think we should find Abigail. - Whoa, wait, no. No, I sent that text message. He just responded, okay. Except I couldn't have sent this because it was sent at the time that we were still in jail. Somebody else had to have sent this. - Maybe the same cop that took Abigail? Okay, let's go. (unsettling music) (electricity buzzing) (thudding) (tires squealing) - Pick up Scott, pick up, pick up. (groaning) - Okay, try not to panic, I'm sure he's fine. (phone vibrating) - Hello, Scotty, haven't seen you in yonks. (phone ringing) - Elizabeth? He's done it. - Who's done what? - [Meredith] Emanuel, he's captured Scott. - Glorious, where is he taking him? - The Lochland house. - Have you told the others? - I will. What about the photographer, is he ready? (chuckling) - Oh, yes, he's finally found his muse. (groaning) - No, don't manifest me here, Scott. I can't help you with this. - Why'd you leave me? You've made me more vulnerable. - I can't answer that, Scott. - You said if you left, I would have a chance. - You do. - How can you say that? Mr. Frazier is going to kill me. - Worse than that. He's going to destroy your soul. - [Scott] How could you betray me Doctor? - I've protected you for as long as I could, Scott. - [Scott] Protected me? I made you up in the first place. - Yeah, you did. And I had power. Enough power to keep Mr. Frazier at bay. - If you had the power, then that just means I have power. - Yeah, but now Mr. Frazier has help. A whole cult's worth of help. - Well how the fuck am I gonna make up to fight that? - How can you fight anyone locked in a trunk with your hands tied behind your back, Scott? (screaming) (groaning) - Any ideas? Dr. Haddy? Dr. Haddy! (screaming) (creaking) (eerie voice echoing) (suspenseful music) (creaking) - Hello, Scotty. (tires screeching) (panting) (thumping) (groaning) - Scott? Scott? Scott? (suspenseful music) - He's not here? What? What, what is it? (gasping) (groaning) - Kate? (blade thwacking) No, Kate, no. - That knocked the wind out of her sins. - Please, no. Please, don't, please-- - Don't get your knickers in a twist like that little wanker you call Scotty. - Just kill me. - I don't need to kill you, Lake. It's always been Scotty, all the way along. You were barely even a bonus. If you'd like to pay your last respects, come by the old homestead tonight. I'd love to meet you in the flesh. (suspenseful choral music) (sighing) (eerie music) - Wait a minute. It's been modified. Wait a minute. No. It means it can be, it can... It can be used as a weapon. Where is it? (thudding) - [Man] Who are you? - Mere Ravenwood. - Very well, welcome on this most sacred evening. (suspenseful music) - Welcome, brothers and sisters. Tonight we revel in glory as we are the first of our time to summon the Prince of Demons, the rune patron of Death, the preserver of Humanity, the Lord of Murder. By this ritual written on the flayed skin of our first sacrifice. We will use the energy we've gathered as a group to free our Lord to walk among us. (groaning) (shouting) (paper tearing) - Hold it! - Run. - I call the shots, Arny. You're just the photographer. - This isn't politics, Elizabeth, this is art. I just thought it would be a wonderful composition to see the pure white skin of Lake Lochland weeping next to her dying brother. I think it would make a nice contrast for this momentous occasion. - No! (screaming) - [Elizabeth] Let's get back to the ceremony. - [Lake] I'm sorry. - The ceremony was read over 10 years ago, you twit. There's only one thing left to do to summon me. - Everyone, stab the sacrifice. (blades thwacking) (screaming) (dramatic choral music) - No! No! (crying) (camera shutter snapping) (muffled screaming) (thunder booming) (laughing maniacally) (crying) - Kill her. - No. Kill her. (gasping) (laughing maniacally) So anxious for greatness when there is no greatness amongst them. (laughing maniacally) Kill yourselves. Kill yourselves! Kill yourselves. (metal music) (laughing maniacally) (camera shutter snapping) Kill yourselves! (camera shutter snapping) (blades thwacking) (blade whooshing) (screaming) (blade thwacking) (camera shutter snapping) (blade thwacking) (camera shutter snapping) (dramatic music) (laughing maniacally) That was beautiful. (laughing maniacally) You're a genius! (laughing maniacally) You'll have so much power in the afterlife, Arny. (screaming) (mysterious booming) There's your gift. (laughing maniacally) - Miss Lochland, the camera, it's a weapon. It might kill him, use it before it's too late. - Get away from that, it's mine. No. No. (chuckling) (whooshing) (screaming) - [Gideon] Hit him again. - No. (mirror shattering) (dramatic music) - You okay? - Yes. - Do you have any idea who did this? - Yes, it was Lake Lochland. The super model, Lake Lochland? - Do you know who that is? - Oh yeah. - She hit me on the head and went on a murderous rampage inside. - Alright, what about all the cloaks and masks in there? Anyone else besides Miss Lochland? - I don't know. She must have been into some pretty kinky stuff. - You don't know, you have no idea? - I have no idea. - Then why are you here? - I thought she was having an affair with my husband. (sighing) - [Detective] Okay. - There's another team at the Lochland apartment and apparently, they've found another body. It was the publicist. - Oh, great. This day's just getting better. Get that looked at, don't go far. - Can I get your information from you? - Yes. - First and last name? - Mere Spiegel Ravenwood. - And address? - Eight Atlas Drive. - [Detective] Thank you, you'll be hearing from us soon. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - You have a lot of talent. Have you ever wanted to be something more?
