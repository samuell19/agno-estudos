(GRUNTS) (HUMMING) (EXCLAIMING) Oh, no! Not Soda. I'm going to kill him. (MOANS) No way. You like him better than you like me. (PHIL SIGHS) Hey. Hey. Hey. Good morning, partner. Thanks. You want to brush my teeth too? Hope I didn't interrupt anything? Look, partner, this early morning shit has got to cease. I've got a 14-year-old kid that Nancy keeps telling me I should have breakfast with at least once a month. Yeah. I agree. But it's not that often that governors come this way, and the force is sworn to protect the heads of state. (YAWNING) What the hell are you talking about? I never swore to that and neither did you. (CHUCKLES) Sounds good though, didn't it? (PHIL SIGHS) Would you two take this noise someplace else? All right, partner. Come on. Come on. It's time to get up. Rise and shine, we've got to fight crime and evil. See you in five. (SIGHS) Remember tonight? Huh? You promised Cameron a big night out. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Don't worry. I'll be home early. Okay. (PEOPLE MURMURING) You still eating those damn crackers? It's a lot better than that crap you're putting in your mouth. Hey, don't knock it till you tried it, huh? All right. All right. You're right. Sure hope they win tonight. Well, it's about time they won something. (PHIL LAUGHING) Hey. Look out. That's my team. Are you two kids lost or something? Now, why don't you just run along, go play somewhere else, huh? (LAUGHS) Nice going, partner. Now, they'll think that all cops are pigs like you. And you know something? You're absolutely right. I'll tell you what, let's set an example for them, okay? I'll take the kid with the curly hair. You take the other one. He looks like the tough one. You kick him in the nuts. You ready? (CHUCKLING) (LAUGHING) Hey, Johnny, look who else got picked for this shit detail. Yeah. The gruesome twosome. (LAUGHING) Hey, knock it off you two or I'll forget that we're brother officers. Hey! Hey, don't blame us. We didn't pick you for this babysitting detail. Babysitting detail is right. Riding shotgun for the governor is just not my bag. Yeah. Well, come on, partner. Even the governor likes to see the Cubbies play once in a while. Yeah. You want some ice cream? No. All right. Hold the fort. I'll be right back. (GUN FIRES) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Sniper on the roof. Block the alleys. (SIREN WAILING) I know it was him. Did you actually see the sniper? Have you got any evidence? Listen, sir. They just released him from prison two weeks ago. He said he was going to get even with me and Phil for putting him there. I'm telling you, it was him. Look, Soda, I want you to get this straight for the last time. The way I see it, the sniper was after the governor, missed him, hit Gillespe, we got him, case closed. And you know as well as I do that every punk we ever lock up always says that he's out to get us. But, sir... Case closed. Now, if I hear that you're harassing Moss, I'll have you up on charges. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. So put out an APB on this guy, no bruises, please. We want him in fine spirit. Get it? Okay. Got it. I'll do an NCIC. CRYSTAL: Thanks. Looks like you had a bad time in there? You might say that. I guess that means he didn't buy your idea about Ivan Moss? Come on, maybe it was a coincidence, him being out? Don't you start too, okay? All right. Here's an up-to-date ID on him. Lieutenant Morgan? You're spending too much time with Sergeant Soda. She's been giving you ID records, hasn't she? Hasn't she? Do you want to get her disciplined? Not especially. Then confine your mutual relationships to the sack. How dare you? Tarver, you're free to resign from the force at any time if we don't measure up to your fine moral standards. Last warning, Soda, you got it? The Gillespe matter is closed. Yeah. Right. You know, the first six months on the force are very tough. Hmm. Then, it gets worse. Jesus Christ! That man is straight out of Caine Mutiny. Does Morgan scare you? No, he doesn't. You do. You know, I can't figure out if you're just boring or terrifying? (CHUCKLES) Why'd you join the force anyway? I couldn't sing. So you want to become a cop? You want the truth? Why not? I dig power. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Sure. (LAUGHS) Sure. I thought it would be fun to tell an audience, "Listen to me sing or I throw you in the slammer." (CHUCKLES) You're real nuts, you know that? You're a nut. (LAUGHS) I know.

Rolling stone gathers no moss, so a moss gathers no stones. You got it. Ah. My little brother is a funny guy. Must have heard that joke 4,000 times. Right, Ace? ACE: Yeah. Well, here you go, big brother. Three first-class on Western to Tahoe. All afternoon flights. Now, if you'll excuse me, there is a little chick over there. Hold it there. We've got another couple of weeks here. Couple of weeks? Yeah. Did you see this? Well, let's not worry about it. We ain't got nothing to worry about, big brother. Should we be worried, Irene? Let's keep her out of this. This woman with you or what? I thought she was with you. (SIGHS) Come on. I don't like it when you guys are kidding. Oh, so that's Soda Cracker, huh? Irene, this doesn't concern you. Why don't you stay out of this, huh? No problem. Yeah. Well, I'll see y'all later. I got a little waitress that I am interested in? IVAN: See you. Okay, you ready? Hold it up firm against the shoulder. Take off the safety. It's going to be a little jolt now, so be prepared for it, all right? Okay. Here we go. Fire. (GUN FIRES) Ah! Jesus. (CHUCKLES) I told you. Let me try it. Come over here a little bit. Watch the shell. The shell is going to come out of here. All right. Pull. Pull. (GUN FIRES) (GUNS FIRING) Pull. Must be getting rusty in my old age. Soda Cracker, how are you? Shouldn't you and I get together, have lunch, just show that I have no hard feelings? That was nice shooting, mister. Thank you, buddy. My name is Ivan Moss. I'm Cameron. Wait for me by car. Okay. Bye. See ya. Nice boy. I know it was you that hit Phil, Moss. I'm on your ass till you crack. And when you do, I'll be there to blow you straight to hell. Are you threatening me? Better than that, pal. I'm promising you. (LAUGHS) You know, I could report you for this? Your word against mine, puke. Puke. Where'd you get that name, Soda Cracker? Some friends gave it to me a long time ago. You really like those things? Do you always ask so many questions? How come we're watching Mr. Moss? Is he a cop? We're watching him because he's watching us. No, he's not a cop. Is he a puke? You don't like him very much, do you? He's number one on my hate list. Someday, I'll explain it all to you, kid. Let's go. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) See you later, Soda, thanks a lot. Hey, Soda, you are coming to your birthday party, right? Why not? Hey, Bess wants to get you a rug for your wall? No. No. That's too expensive man. Think that will stop her? No. Hey, you want a little advice? Would it make a difference? Not really. Soda, I know how close you were to Phil, but you got to lighten up, man. I'm serious. You've been sleeping and eating this Gillespe thing for over a month. Twenty-two days. SODA: Don't give me that bullshit. I want that information or our next meeting will be in a holding cell. All right, Pond, get on it. The two follow-ups on the Clifford murder, and you got these and these and these and these. As far as I can see, nothing's been done. And you've got these... These two homicides. What the hell is going on here, Soda? I'm working on it, sir. This is out of your territory. This is your third and last warning. What's Nancy doing here? Getting Phil's personal effects. Soda, this record goes back to files and it stays there. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. No, I will not excuse you, God damn it. This department is not arranged for your pleasure. You're screwing up, Soda. Now, you get your cases done and lay off the Gillespe investigation. Nancy, I could have brought those things home for you. What's this? Oh, it's just something a two-bit hood used for a hold up. Oh, you know, it's embarrassing some of the things we have to keep for evidence when we bust a hooker. Right. (SIGHS) It's just a hooker, Nancy, just a hooker. I appreciate what you're doing, Soda. At least, what you're trying to do. I... From the superintendent, he said how sorry he was about Phil. I thought I really knew Phil and there were nights that someone would call and he'd go. I always wanted to believe it was police work. I guess I know now. Now, come on, Nancy. He was always faithful to you. Honest he was. Soda, this is hard for me to say, but I don't think it'd be a good idea for Cameron to spend a lot of time around cops. Oh, come on. I know some of the boys are a little crass... I don't want my son around cops. You married a cop, Nancy. Yeah. I got a call from a hooker once, Soda. You know what she said? She said she was sleeping with Phil. She said, that's how he got information out of her. Come on, Nancy. You know better than that. That's what they all say when they get busted. He never did that. Sure he did. And he knew you'd cover for him. Did you ever give Phil a chance to explain? Forget it. What I don't want is you teaching my 14-year-old son how to use a shotgun. All right, Nancy. In fact, I don't want Cameron to see you anymore. Is that clear enough? If that's what you want? Soda, why don't you take this stuff and chuck it? They want you in Conference Room D. Who? The commission. For what? Why? Have you... Have you done something dumb? Not that I know of. Well, then, you don't have anything to worry about, do you? Now, straighten up your tie and get in there, and be pleasant. Oh, they don't know that you've been investigating Phil. Ha, ha. (DOOR OPENS) Ever take a bribe, Sergeant Soda? No, sir. Phil Gillespe ever take one? Not to my knowledge, sir. Yes or no? No, sir. That's all. You can go. Is there something wrong, sir? We ask the questions, not you. Dismissed. (DOOR CLOSES) What do you think? He didn't admit anything. I don't think he knows. He's got a good alibi. I'm looking for someone. So is everyone else. Name's Pond. Pond who? He doesn't go by any last name. I can't help. (SIGHS) Look, pal. I'm not in the mood for 20 questions, okay? So let's not play games. Pond ain't here. No, shit. I've been asking around. They tell me he works here sometimes. (SCOFFS) Sometimes is right, but junkyards seem to be his thing. Try Stony Island over around 89th Street. I'll do that now. But if he's not there, I won't be in a good mood when I come back. Hello, Pond. How did you find me? That's my job. You want a beer? That's not what I want from you, buddy. I told you on the phone, I ain't got nothing to tell you. I don't know what the fuck you're doing here. Jesus Christ, don't you ever clean up this goddamn place? Hey, my girlfriend, Ingrid, she used to clean it. She used to put a broom to it once in a while, but she split. She went to California. She wanted to become an actress. Yeah. Yeah. Right. When have you seen Ace? I told you, about a year ago is the last time I'd seen him. We went hunting pheasants. There was no goddamn pheasant hunting last year, but there was a lot of coke ran between Chicago and Detroit. Hey, don't start that shit with the cocaine, man. I don't do no drugs. I never did no drugs, and I ain't gonna start now. And I'm just telling you this, I went hunting pheasants with him and that's about it. You know what? I used to shoot them before they get up to fly. He'd call that a sport. Hey, Ace. I heard they got bitches out in the force now. What's that supposed to mean? You don't like cops? I hate the cock suckers. I hate them. Your big brother, Ivan, know you're here? You called him, didn't you? Hey, homes, I didn't know this guy was coming around, man. I swear. He just dropped in, right, Ace? God will you get you for that, Pond. Hey, why don't you piss off, fuck face. Come on, Ace, you just did some time for too much violence. Why don't you get out, fucker? I wish you wouldn't call me that. Why not, fucker? You might piss me off. It might get ugly. Hey, what is it, do you want to take a ride downtown or something? You're going to collar me? No. But I got a friend. Yeah. A cop? Yeah. He's outside. Used to play pro-ball. About your size. There ain't nobody outside. I looked. Well, maybe he saw your ugly face. (BOTTLE SHATTERS) (MEN GRUNTING) Where were you, partner? Hey, man, I stopped to get you a birthday present. IVAN: Nurse, this is Ivan Moss. Let me speak to my brother. Ace, how are you doing? Yeah, I heard. Soda shouldn't have done that? No, he doesn't know anything. I told you, he doesn't know anything. Now, let's not argue. Soda is not going to stop until we give him a funeral. So let's give him a funeral. I'll talk to your later. You take care. Yeah. SODA: Who's there? It's me, Crystal. Ready for the big party? Yeah. Need some help? Hey, hey, very funny. Wait for me in the other room. Sure. I'll see you. Okay. I heard you had some trouble with the Moss brothers. No problem. I got them worried. One's following me and the other one's trying to beat the crap out of me. (GRUNTS) Probably, they both would like to beat the crap out of me, but I'm too quick for them. Sure. Lightning fast devil that's you. Damn, are you sure you're all right? You're starting to cuss. Yeah. Well, maybe I'm going to be a cop after all, huh? I'm sure. They think I know something. Something more than just their illegal video porno operation. Uh-huh. We're getting back to hunches again, huh? Oh, no. It's not a hunch. Hunches ain't nothing. It's the thing that gives you the hunch that puts pukes in jail. Sure. We could play 20 questions. Is this hunch an animal, mineral or... Ah! Come on, Crystal, it's something. I don't know. What's with all this phony ID stuff? Oh, I get it from muggers, rapists. Aren't you supposed to turn this stuff in? I might need it for cover sometime. Hi, my name is Don Smith and I am with the Rod Iron Corporation. We just happened to have broken into your home here and we're going to do what we call a surreptitious search. Crystal, do you think that pukes play by the rule book? (CHUCKLES) Right. In order to preserve the law, we have to break it. It's my birthday. Would you knock it off, okay? Can I get dressed? Sure. (WHISTLES) You're really hurt, aren't you? Nah. Not much. Nothing a good, stiff drink wouldn't help. You pour, I'll get the ice. (CHUCKLES) Yes, sir, Sergeant Soda. Hey, it's my birthday. Oh, yeah? Well, you're getting a lot of mileage out of that, sport. (SCREAMS) You're asking for it. (DOORBELL BUZZING) Saved by the buzzer. (BOTH LAUGHING) (GASPS) Happy birthday. Get in here. Who was that? It's Phil's son, Cameron. Hi. Cameron, Crystal. Hi, Crystal. Hi, Cameron. Are you all set for the party? Yeah. Mom didn't want me to come. She's been acting funny lately. Say, how do you get a pretty girl like Crystal? (CHUCKLES) Oh! The same way you get a puke? How is that? You sneak up on him. Oh, that's very funny. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (PEOPLE CLAPPING) What's going on, old buddy? Hey, hey. (LAUGHING) Okay. I'll drink to that, my 21st birthday. (ALL LAUGHING) A little something for you. Okay. Happy birthday. Twenty-three. (LAUGHS) Presents. Presents. Wait a minute. Cake first. Cake first. Cut the cake first. Here we go. Time for the presents. Time for the presents. Yeah. Wait. This is from me. Oh, you like it, huh? (ALL LAUGH) Very funny. Oh, I thought so, yeah. What's the matter with my buddy? Oh, he's just upset because the office keeps calling him. I keep telling him that computers are never happy, but you know Peter, worrywart. Excuse me. Anyone wants a little cake here? (SIGHS) Yeah. You're looking great, Soda. (LAUGHING) Well, maybe there's something to birthdays after all, buddy? Yeah. When you're young, they remind you you're not grown up. And when you're grown up, they remind you, you're not young. (BOTH LAUGH) Yeah. There's something to that. Hey, look, I want to thank you for the party. (SIGHS) I wouldn't do it for anyone else, old buddy. I'll drink to that. I guess, you want a big piece of cake? There's one there. All right. Anything else? A little vodka, maybe? Those clowns said she had to boost her savings account by 15 percent. Savings, how do people save anything these days? You know what a pound of hamburger cost? (BOTH CHUCKLE) Well, I could always stop into headquarters and bust a few skulls for you, man. I bet you would do that. (LAUGHS) Hey, man your wife, she's a great woman and she cooks a hell of a cake too, buddy. Yeah. I'm lucky to have a woman like that. Here, here. Drink to that too. Oh, yeah. It's beautiful out there. PC, I've got a 100-year-old barn, 70-acre property there, that when I get through with that, it's going to be a dream house. Absolutely gorgeous. That kind of country you would like. Yeah. That kind of living you would like, too, believe me. Hey, we haven't gone fishing lately. Yeah. Well, I can understand that because the last time I out fished you, outcast you, outdid you for those catfish. (CHUCKLING) Hey, let's take Cameron. I've got a perfect fishing rod for him. Let me show it to you. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hey, let me freshen up my drink first. Oh, okay. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (ALL GASPING) Excuse me. Let me through, please. (BESS EXCLAIMING) Take care of her. He's dead. (BESS CRYING) Pete. Pete. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Well, welcome to the house of death. Come on. You're talking crazy. You've been drinking too much. You betcha. You betcha. You betcha. You wanna die? So, you see, I wanna celebrate. Don't give me that self-pity. (LAUGHS) All right. Free advice from Ann Sanders Landers. I'm over here. I gotta... I gotta... Don't push. (GRUNTING) Come on. I'm comfortable. Let me help you. I'm fine. I'm gonna put you to bed. Come on. Come on. Give me that. I'm a little stoned. Come on. I just wanna... All righty. Up. Help me. (GASPS) (POND GASPS) (GRUNTING) (EXPLOSIVE RUMBLING) (POND GROANING) BRENTWALL: This chap, Ace Moss, been in prison several times, nasty record, possible drug dealer. Says you assaulted him. Is that correct? Well, sir, I guess you could say that. You have a superior record with the force. Excellent evaluations. But sometimes we get a little too close to things involved on a personal level. That's why we thought you ought to take leave. I appreciate that, sir, but... Now, let me finish. Now, there was a time, and it was in my day, where we were admired, respected. Hell, we were loved by everyone in this country, and that's changed. You know why? Lawyers dying off our mistakes. They feast. Politicians sit down with them and work deals. It makes me sick. Do you agree with me, Lieutenant Morgan? I would, sir. BRENTWALL: Now, Sergeant Soda, I understand how you feel about your partner's killer. The force looks after its own, but we can't be seen on a vendetta anymore. That's exactly what the TV wants. A little more publicity, and the Feds will clamp down on us so hard, that we won't be able to fart in our shithouses. Now, do I make myself clear? Yes, sir. Lieutenant Morgan has arranged to put you on a plane tomorrow. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Release him. Dismissed. (DOOR CLOSES) I wish we had more like him. (DOORBELL BUZZING) Oh, hi. CRYSTAL: May I come in? Uh, sure. Go ahead. I've got some coffee. You want some? Sure. Great. I just dropped by to see how you're doing. Uh, just fine. You? Okay. Could be better. I know what that's like. How do you take your coffee? Oh, black. Is something special bothering you? (SIGHS) No. Murphy's Law. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. I know something, and I don't know what it is. Do you know what I mean? (CHUCKLES) Here, let me take that so you can have a cookie. It's beautiful. What's it worth? I don't know. Nothing, probably. I like it, though. I'm moving to Toronto. Oh? Yeah. My parents are up there. (SIGHS) I just can't seem to handle Cameron anymore. Oh, just give him some time, Nancy. I know. I need help, though. Did you hear that I got a letter from the governor? Uh-uh. He wants Cameron and me to accept a commendation for Phil. That will make Cameron proud. I'm not gonna go. I'm not even gonna tell Cameron about it. With any encouragement, he'll end up a cop. It's a... Well, we've been through that before. Yeah. Well, I have to go. Uh, say hello to Cameron for me, will you? Yeah. And if you need anything, call me. Um, listen, if you wanna see Cameron before we go... I mean, anytime, it's okay. Thanks. Wish I was going with you. Wish I was staying. They're putting the squeeze on me. Do as Morgan says, just this once. They'll never find the goddamn sniper. They're looking in the wrong place. Yes, we will. We? The department. For a minute, I thought they were assigning you to the case. Oh, I see. They are assigning you. Hey, it wasn't my idea, okay? I'm just doing what they tell me. Look, I gotta go, all right? Have a good trip. (CAR HORN HONKING) SODA: You must have had a good reason for not wanting me to get on that plane? What's on your mind, Crystal? Come on, spit it out. I went to see Nancy today. So? And... Well, maybe you can explain this. Do you think Phil was on the take? No, way. No, way. My partner on the take? No way. Nancy has a vase that must be worth $3,000. Now, where the hell does a cop get the money to buy a vase for $3,000? And you know what? There's a trophy case full of expensive trinkets. My partner, on the take? I don't believe it. There's no way. Well, what do we do now? Jesus. What do you mean "we"? Do you still think that Moss iced Phil? Yeah, I'm sure of it. I got a little more pressure I wanna put on him. Good. Let's go. Police. All right. Don't anybody move. You can't come in here. That means your mouth, too, puke. (SODA SIGHS) I have not had so much fun since police school. Now, where do we go next? Hey, hey. Come on. Hold on, dirty Harriet. I'll go it alone from here. Come on. Come on, you stuck your pretty neck out far enough. What I got in mind, you don't wanna be a part of. All right. You know where to find me. Yes, ma'am. You call me if you need me, now. You got it. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (TOY TRAIN WHIRRING) Nice layout. How in the hell did you get in here? Tricks of the trade. Listen, I've got $100. It's in my purse. Just get it and get the... Just get out. Sit down, Irene. (SIGHS) Hawaiian? Oh, wait a minute. Cop or no cop, I want a lawyer. That's fine with me. You have no legal right to be here. Reasonable cause. Some people saw you buying this. That's a lie. I don't know. Maybe I could find a dozen friends who say they saw you. Irene, what's a nice girl like you raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by a Baptist family doing in 21 Lake Tahoe? How did you find that out? (LAUGHS) Computers, phone calls, finks. But what's hard to figure is you and Ivan. We're just friends. The guy is mixed up into a lot of heavy things. I mean, what's your Baptist family gonna say when they come to visit you in the pen? You got nothing. I could book you on possession of a illegal substance. For a half of lid of grass? Hey, that's all it takes. I mean, I could throw in a couple grams of coke, get you a couple of years? At least let me get dressed. You're doing this to get Ivan, aren't you? He's a smart man. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. (SCOFFS) All right, Irene, where's the coke? That's just a piece of jewelry. That's all. Are you a snowbird, baby? Snowbird? Your old man, he's a big time coke dealer, ain't he? (LAUGHS) Come on, let's go. I'd rather have a drink. Really? Really. You think that will help you remember things a lot better? Maybe. The libations are in here. SODA: Hello, Ivan. And there's Ace. God damn, little buddy. You got great powers of recuperation. Got something on your mind, Soda? Yeah. A couple of murders. I suppose you'll be catching those responsible? You can count on it, pal. Hey, I like the train set. Bet you're pretty good with model airplanes, too. Oh, yeah. You're girlfriend, Irene. I don't think she likes you anymore. (DOOR CLOSES) IVAN: How are you doing? Hi. How did the recording session go? Pretty good. How would you like a new line of magic? Okay. Where's that coke spoon I gave you? I don't know. What did you do all day? Played solitaire. Did you? Go for it. Nice stuff. You left some of that good stuff on the blade. Stick out your tongue. Let me have your tongue. I missed you. I bet you tell that to all the boys. Irene, I don't like seconds. I don't know what you mean. You two got it on, didn't you? Is that what you mean about seconds? Did you get it on? IRENE: You have every right to be mad. He thinks you had something to do with his partner's death. He came up here. He threatened me. (SIGHS) He found the grass, and he tried to bust me. You did what you had to do, right? I love you, Ivan. What did you tell him? Nothing. Honest. Honest. Irene, I like you. You know, when I like people, I level with them. And I expect people who like me to level with me. So I'm gonna ask you one more time. What did you tell Soda Cracker? Nothing. Honest. I love you. Of course, you do. I did it for you. Sure. (CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING) Asshole. Don't ever call me an asshole again, asshole. You can't do nothing to me. You ain't even supposed to be in town. How do you know I wasn't supposed to be here, you big dumb son of a bitch? You don't get nothing. (MEN GRUNTING) Maybe it was you that wasted my partner. I got nothing to say. I want answers, Ace. Get lost. I'm tired of your goddamn bullshit. You can't. Can't what? Shoot you in the arm, blow off your goddamn kneecaps, shoot you in the balls? I don't know nothing. (CAR SCREECHING) Freeze, Soda. OFFICER: What you doing, Soda? He's killing me. This clown was in on the killing of Phil. He jumped me. He's gonna kill me. Drop the gun, fellow. Officer or not. Don't ever point a gun at another cop. What the hell are you teaching these goddamn rookies? Got evidence, Soda? Jesus Christ! Do you think I'd be doing this if I had evidence? Lock him up. What's the charge? Disturbing the peace. We can't let you go, Soda. What are you gonna do? Shoot me? (DOORBELL BUZZING) Yeah? Who's there? Brentwall. (BUZZER SOUNDING) Who the hell decorated this place? I did. Looks like a yuppie nightmare. You got a drink? I'd like some Scotch. Thirty years ago, your father and I raised hell together. Yeah. You told me about it. You set a bag on fire one time, tried to stamp it out. (CHUCKLES) Right. Found out the bag was full of dog shit. (CHUCKLES) I guess you think you can run things yourself? No. No, sir. You lied to me. Why? I didn't know my partner was on the take. (SIGHING) We knew we had a rotten apple for months. You think Gillespe infected anyone else in the force? I don't know. It's possible. I was going to throw you in the slammer for coming back. Now, you stay home and keep clean. Agreed? Yes, sir. Irene? Where's Ace? He ain't here. Well, I can see that. Where is he? He's been in jail all night. Soda had him arrested for disturbing the peace. You get down there, and you bail him out. I'll be at the gym. GYM TRAINER: Come on, one more. IVAN: Twenty-four, twenty-five... That's real good. That's real good. ...twenty... Hey, chump. Come back here. How about a cracker? You want a cracker? What? No. No. I guess not. Get this thing off me! So tell me, who's your connection in the department, Ivan? Huh? (GRUNTING) Come back here! Wanna talk about Phil? Jesus. He did me favors, all right? (GRUNTING) Yeah. Like what? Helped me get coke through customs. We used diplomatic pouches. Get this thing off me, will you? You wouldn't happen to have any of that around here, would you? What? No. No. (GRUNTING) All right. Right in the attache case. Cracker, God damn it, get this thing off me. Cracker? (GRUNTING) You bastard. (GUN FIRES) Soda, you son of a bitch! You were about to tell me something? Hold it, Soda. Some kind of lookout you are. Yeah. Next time, you be lookout. I want you two to shut up. This clown, Ace, Phil and Pete. I told you to shut up. Now, get them out of here. Hey! Come on. Don't leave me like this! Get this thing off of me! Well, I'll make all the arrangements. I was thinking about a white casket. Yeah. Okay, Mama. Bye. Mama's got courage, you know. She didn't even cry. It's not right. Ace was trying to save me, and that damn cop wasted him. He's in jail. No telling for how long. You know how these cops work together. They take care of their own, they do. I never thought it would turn out this way. Soda will be out in a day or two. He just keeps hounding and hounding me. I need for you to leave me alone, Irene. I can stay. I said I need for you to leave me alone, Irene. OFFICER: You seen Soda? Yeah. He's in with Brentwall. I got a letter here for him. Oh, I'll take it. My God. Let me put it this way. I gave you a second chance. Now, it's formal charges, Soda. Consider yourself busted. You're off the force until further notification. Yes, sir. And it's going to be very hard to get the force out of this one. Well, anyway, at least you have the coke. That's funny. What coke? Sir, there was coke there in the attache case at the gym. Powdered sugar. Sir, I know coke when I see it. I was there. I watched the tests. There must be another leak in the department. There was coke there when I left it. (SIGHS) Damn. You were right. He was in the take with Phil. I really believed that story about his inheritance. Shit, I even helped him build this place. That son of a bitch. (SIGHING) Well, we better give him a chance to explain before we do anything, okay? Sure. Another month, and you'll have this place looking pretty good. It's over, Ivan. What's that supposed to mean? I've written it all down. Dates, places, drug shipments, and how Phil got involved. You wrote all that down? I sent a copy to Soda. He should get his this morning. And another copy goes to Brentwall. It will be delivered to him tonight. Why are you doing this? I'll be dead and so will you. I told you not to hit Gillespe. Your personal vendetta had nothing to do with our operations. Now, you've got Soda on your ass. (SCOFFS) And there's nothing that's going to stop him. What are you doing? And about the cocaine. They'll find it with our bodies. Look, I made a mistake, and I'm gonna pay for it. Not through any trial. You and me, we're just gonna die quietly. Why don't we talk about this? Ivan. You tried to convince me to look away, and you've done it a couple of times. And that was pretty wonderful for a man with a bad heart and not much time left. Goodbye, Ivan. (GUN FIRES) Shit! (DOG WHIMPERS) (SIGHS) Goodbye, old fellow. (GUN FIRES) Shit. He didn't have to do this. (GUN FIRES) You wait here. Okay. (GUN FIRES) (THUDDING) (GUN FIRING) (GUN CLICKING) (GRUNTS) IVAN: It's just you and me, baby. (GRUNTS) (CREAKING) (FOOTSTEPS PATTERING) Soda. Look out, Soda! (BIRDS CHIRPING) (EXCLAIMS) Oh, shit. (TRAIN HORN BLOWING) Oh, shit. SODA: Don't. Son of a bitch.
