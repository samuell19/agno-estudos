(lf God created humans,) (and they created robots.) (Should we not question our maker) (the way humans question theirs?) (K88's last words, 2046) A hundred million! Whoever lets me go gets a hundred million. You think everyone's like you that they'd do anything for money? Listen, Xu Dachun is not some petty thug you can buy and sell. As long as I wear this badge, I'll fight to keep scum like you off the street. Wanna buy me off? Give it a rest! I need a hundred million! Don't laugh! Don't think I'll kill you? Don't you touch my hundred million! Don't kill him! Don't move! Free at last! Take him away! My bank account is 245-289-2109. Don't forget it... Got it! Get out of the way... I am one of the ten most wanted criminals, K-1! Whoever rescues me will get 3 hundred million! 3 hundred million! A billion! Bastard! Keep running... Let's see where it gets you! Why should I? Take a look! I'll give you one last chance. Save yourself or die for your country? Which do you love more? I gave my life to my country long time ago. Go ahead! Good answer! They obviously chose the right guy. Aren't you dead already? Get out of the way! My name is Lin Xiang, the director of Tianan Scientific Research Center. We specialize in synthetic alternatives to human law enforcement. I've looked at your record. Loyal. Righteous. And you love our country and the party. And from your performance just now, I'd say that your patriotism is also beyond reproach. So, you were testing me. What would you say if I told you there were robots living among us? That you're lying. And what if I tell you that they were next to indestructible? That they could fly at the upper reaches of our atmosphere? Or dig to the earth's molten core? Or that they could transform themselves into metallic goliaths and still run faster than a sports car? Finished? I may just be some hick from a small backwater town But, I know plenty about the outside world. What makes you so sure? Experience, knowledge, intuition. Technically speaking, experience is just one form of memory. One of many. And knowledge is an obstacle if it can't keep pace with the times. All is fake obviously. But you thought they were real. So, what about that intuition of yours? What you just saw is called Unstable Fuzzy Video Virus It's the latest invention of my assistant, Yingming. Dachun, our country has invented a new generation of artificial intelligence. But we at the bureau have been discussing it. We feel that until we are a hundred percent sure it is safe and to avoid any negative publicity, we can't put it into public service yet. We are looking for a man we can trust, someone like you. You understand? Got it! You've read my file. You must know that I wanted to be a cop since I was a kid. And that I didn't even have a chance to visit my parents on their deathbed because I was on a case. I've lost track of the number of times I've tried to get transferred. So I could stop being the big fish in a small pond. Now, finally you come with a mission worthy of my talents. When do we leave? Leave? And where to go? Out of here! To the place I should go! We're not taking you out. We're sending the robot in. What? I'm practically falling apart from being stuck in this shit hole. How's a robot supposed to cope with? Your assignment is to take care of him for me. Most importantly keep his identity secret from the others. Piece of cake! When does he arrive? He is already here. Smoke? Give it a rest. You're a machine. Machines don't need cigarettes. In order to be accepted by society, I always keep a pack of cigarettes with me. It is said that a man who has cigarettes always has friends. And useful for breaking uncomfortable silences. Anyway, it is allowed by my programming. Come on, boss. Take one! It's good for you! Single tunnel delivery with projectile configuration! See? Now there's something machines can't do! You might be right. Ears are easy! Eyes... now that's hard! Smoke through the eyes? How in god's name did you accomplish that? Willpower. Single-tunnel delivery is apparently quite common in this region. Can't do it! You broke it! I did not! You broke it! Prove it! Cut the bullshit and do something useful. Dami, call Mr. Jiang. Dami is taking a dump. Then why don't you do it for him? I think maybe Sumei would have more luck. Keep fixing the computer. Philistine! It's no wonder you were assaulted! As a pervert, you're just the kind of woman I'd be lookin Hey, you heard his heart beat before he made his move? Is it true? Amei, even your heart beats faster when you see me, right? Can you blame them? We went to school together. Why would I lie? Sign it. Oh, Statement starts with the letters. Chief, you... What? Never seen a superhero before? Sure. Just not quite so dorky. See, this is the first impression people get from you. I would like you all to meet K-1. K-1 has been sent by the Bureau to assist me. This is Jin Hongan, Zhang Yang, Liu Bin... Xiaomi... and Dami. Where's Dami? Dami is in the bathroom. He's had the runs lately. Diarrhea all day long, nothing else And this one? Chief? Allow me. I'm Zhou Sumei. Ok! So that should just about to do it. I wouldn't get too close. This is your office. Make yourself at home. Don't look for me unless it's an emergency. Nice Feng Shui. Very nice. I'll be getting promoted in no time. Let me call someone to clean up for you. It's ok. I'll do it myself. I wouldn't get to close! I didn't break it. Sumei! What seems to be the problem? Jiang! You're always around right when we need you. How is that exactly? Sometimes I just get a feeling. No need to call! Give it a rest. Fix it. Everyone, keep back! Give it some space! It's probably just overheated. Temperature seems normal. Maybe just a cold? Should I get a blanket? Xiao Jiang, loosen up. These guys are just giving you a hard time. Sumei. Here I am. The toilet exploded! Shit everywhere! Oh my god What's happening here? Why are you here? Aren't you supposed to be a teacher or something? Why are you hanging around? Let me guess. Sumei? How about doing something about those teeth first. Mr. Jiang, don't push yourself too hard. It'll work! I'll make it work! Why didn't you grab him? I thought you would! Step away. All better. OK. I'm going to take a look at the plumbing. See? I told you I'd fix it... Sumei, I'm just trying to look out for you. It's what I promised your father. No matter what happens, I will look after you and your sister. I mean, just look at him. He's from big city. Not one of us. I can only guess he must have been demoted. I mean, why else would a young guy in his prime take an assignment like this? Right? I volunteered. I'm right. Anyway, I'm just saying, don't let appearances fool you. I even heard some of the guys in Beijing say he's got a bit of a reputation. He nonsense! You know... with the ladies. Mr. Xu! The item you ordered... What are you looking at? Never seen a handsome guy? Give it to me! On my account. Please. Not again. What? I said on my account. I'm good for it. Credit. It's how things are done these days. But... Let's go. Is the money in your shoe? Is it in your shoe? Maybe... I forgot it. How much? A hundred and twenty! And... last time and second last time? Next time! What? My money's no good? No... Let's go! I forgot I'd put it there. Too much on my mind. When you have as much money as I do, it's easy to lose track. What kind of soup should I make? I can cook whatever you want. Are you going to school? Yes. Have you taken all the books? Yes. Morning, Auntie Yan! Morning! Your sister will be back from school for break in a couple days. I changed the bedding... Auntie Yan, what soup are you making for tonight? Making? I'd say somebody's already made it! How can he just come and go like it's his own house? Come and go as he likes! How dare he? You and Suqing need your privacy. I asked him to change the lock! How could I know he'd make a copy for himself? After Dad said how much he trusted him, I thought I could just think of him as a brother. Anyway, I'm going to apply for a transfer to the city as soon as Suqing graduates. Time for breakfast! Get it while it's hot... Hey. I can tell when I'm not welcome! Ok... I'm leaving! Here. Take your key... I didn't mean that. By the way, I was up all night listening to that friend of yours with his noise. What on earth was he doing? He disturbed you? That's it. He's going in the attic. Come in. What happened to my door? Surprised? I installed a hound dog system. It has a program that analyses your body odor as you approach and decides whether to Thanks to the upgrades to my optical sensors, I can see through pretty much anything. What? I'm not kidding. Don't bother them! This is not the first time you've been harassed. Go home! I'll see you all in court! Go home! Excuse me. Is this yours? Leave it. Let me take a look. Hurry. Turn around! Don't peek! You guys are about to finish? Getting there. I want all the open cases from the last three years. Chief, all here! Don't go there! You. Turn away! There are more than thirty cases over the past three years. Auntie Zhang and The Missing Teeth. Mrs. Li and the case of the Lost Sixteen Dollars and Fifty Cents... Cash. Uncle Qi's lost seven underpants and a lottery ticket. Little Wang and the Runaway Pussycat... And he just had a fight with Xiaoli. Teeth all over the place. We never could make a set. Those are the open cases. Should we call Interpol? Get some reinforcements? Reinforcements? Nonsense! K-1 can handle it. Here you are. Wrap these up or your superiors will hear about it in my next report. I think you can imagine how they'll deal with failure. Don't be silly. How can a Robot imagine anything? You... I'm not permitted to use my enhanced optical functions for ethically questionable activities unless they're required to perform my duties as an officer of the law. What color of the underwear is she wearing? Red! Red? Pervert! Whatever happened to not permitted! You're the boss. It's my job to follow orders. Back to work. You... Chief. Just got a tip that Sangbiao is in town. Sounds like he's planning something big. Of all the towns in China... what's he doing here? Chief! I'm done. Sorry to keep you waiting. All done? Thank you K1! Mr. Dachun, K1 found my teeth. Handsome and smart! So charming! All in a day's work. Let's have a party to celebrate! Don't you think it's a good idea? Not necessary. We're just doing our jobs! Come on, take mine. Found it. It's fantastic! You know how much I can take. Who'll take her back? She will be fine. All right. Let's go. No one is like you. Stop it. Go home! You are going alone? See you. Come to my place for a drink. Communication with females is best facilitated through the use of humor and frivolity. At the shop yesterday, how did you know about the money in his shoe? That would be the upgrades to my optic sensors. And last night with all the noise... what were you doing? You know, when I can't sleep, a little engine repair is just the thing. No big deal. Look, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. Why would you say you have optic sensors? Or that the other stuff. I'm sorry. The truth is... I was practicing my super powers. You still don't believe me? Here. I'll prove it to you. Turn this way. Look at me. And close your eyes. Close them. Why? Done. You can open them now. Bit of food. I thought policemen were supposed to find bicycles but not steal them. I didn't steal it. Some nice lady lent it to me. Really? And why would she do that? Because I'm cute. Hop on. Thanks. Bye bye! Come again! Hey. Take a seat... What do you want? Still fried noodles? I thought you'd be out celebrating with the others. I won't be doing any celebrating until I figure out a way to deal with that damn computer! Taking out a computer system isn't all that difficult. Just introducing a virus, like Love Potion 369. Ought to do the trick. But you still haven't told me what this has to do with Sumei. It's confidential. I can only tell you that she needs our help. And that once she's been saved. She's likely to be very appreciative. Her father basically made me responsible for finding her a husband. And she has to listen to me. Elder brother is like father! Dad, I'll do whatever you say. Sit down. Listen, the thing about Love Potion 369 is that it's what we call a current virus. It's not limited to computers. It travels along electrical currents so it can infect other types of machines as well. Cool! Sit down... Even common household appliances would be rendered useless the moment it was switched on. It infects everything! Even the hot water from a hot-water boiler. What does he get? Love Potion Number 369. Bird Flu Edition. That does it! Bill Gates will be rolling in his grave. Bill Gates? He was the chairman of a company called Microsoft. Micro... soft? No wonder I never heard of him. Ok. So now I've installed the virus. No machine should be able to resist, not even Sumei's. Really? Allow me to demonstrate. Cool? Turn it off. Coming! Ghost... Dachun, it's me! I couldn't find my key. And my sister wasn't home. Suqing! What happened to you? You look terrible! Like king of the beggars! Hi, Mr. Jiang, what are you doing here? Just fixing computers. Are you? I'm so thirsty! Don't drink that! Why? Just don't drink that! Don't! Don't answer it! Shit! What's gotten into you? Suqing! Don't be afraid! It does this all the time! Jiang! Get up! Do something! Can you stop it? Jiang... Jiang, where have you been? Come, help me... Ah... my back... Mr. Jiang! Suqing? Hey guys! Make yourself at home! Mei, are you here for Dachun? No... Mei, what a coincidence! Nothing like a little exercise after supper! This is going to be a hard one to explain. Come, take it for me. Chun, are you ok? I'm fine as usual. What's going on? Nothing. Love Potion Number 369. Jiang, what is wrong with you? Don't worry. Get him to a hospital. Give him couple shots and he'll be fine. And you call yourself a teacher! You should be ashamed of yourself! Suqing, get this guy to the hospital. I don't even want to look at him. Leave it to me. Let's go! Haven't you done enough! Shame on you! Out! How did you come up with this idea? Let's see how tough you are now. Five minute warning for the meeting. You've been inside the whole morning! Right away! Why can't I function normally when I look into her eyes? Euphoria, a human emotion commonly generated as the result of intensely pleasurable stimulus, like a child seeing a box of chocolate. Also commonly experienced by humans in love. Sweet and bitter all at once. Warning. Your neural chip shows a dangerous concentration of activity in your emotional centers. Line 134 of the Robot Protocol clearly forbids the artificial simulation of the human experience of love. Failing to execute Line 134 will initiate an immediate system shut down. It's the wrong Sang. Should be like this. That's how the Japanese write it. Ridiculous, huh? Meeting... Big deal! Only 5 minutes late. I didn't know you wore contacts. I thought maybe I was seeing things last night. But I woke up this morning and my eyes were still perfect. Excuse me... Where is my file? It's gone? Isn't it in front of you? No need for stereo. We are just wrong all the time. Which one is right? Sumei, Please brief us on Mr. Sangbiao. What did you say to him? Sangbiao. His real name is Chen Yongbiao, Shanxi Province. Six feet tall. But quick for a man of his size. He has been arrested three times over the past two decades. He disappeared after successfully robbing a bank last year. According to our informant, he is hiding out in an abandoned parking garage about 10km away. Does anyone have something to add? Yes. I discovered this on the Internet. A site called "China's Top Three Stars"... Apparently there is a famous Hong Kong actress, named Yang Qianhua, who sometimes goes by the name Sangbiao. In order to determine whether this was the same Sangbiao I have contacted Ms. Yang several times. But have only managed to reach her answering machine. Is it worth pursuing? Sit down! We're keeping this simple. K-1 and I will approach from the north, Flushing Sangbiao out through the back of the building. The rest of you will form a back-up unit here, in the clearing out back. You'll be waiting for my order. Yes! Just you and K-1? It's too dangerous! He's never been there before! You're only worried about him? I've never been there either! Let's synchronize our watches. It is now 10:20 am. Ok... Get the stuff. I told Fat Shan and Tang to rendezvous with us here tomorrow. It's 2:30. What's taking so long? Things take time. Even taking a dump you have to open the door, drop your pants and warm the seat. Be patient. These things take time. Chief... What? Scared? No. I mean... it'll be better if I go up by myself. They can't hurt me. Bullshit! Because you're a robot? Let me tell you something. We made you. And anything that can be made can be destroyed. Got it? We meet here. Great! Crazy mutt ripped my pants. Not cheap you know? I'll kick your ass! Freeze! He is going up to the roof! Who? Police! My battery's dying! What? 1 month out of the factory and you're already broken? My washing machine lasted longer. I just re-charged this last night. What happened? Po... police! Let me... what? We need him alive. What the hell? Motion depressant. What? Another malfunction? Out of my way! Don't move! Sorry! Stop... I'm... running... Shoot... him... Po... police! Go to hell! Go away... I haven't seen K-1 for days! Seems odd, doesn't it? I'm fine. Don't worry. But you have to eat! It's been two days! Are you hiding from me? Is there something you aren't telling me? Do you know why you're so unhappy? What makes you think I'm unhappy? Admitting there's a problem is the first step to solving it. How can I be happy? Dachun and K-1 were both injured in the line of duty! Let me tell you the reason. The fact is playing policewoman isn't enough for you. You want to play nurse as well. You can't have it both ways. Which do you think suits me better? Personally speaking, around Dachun, you're Kojack. And around K-1 you're Florence Nightingale. What are you saying? I'm saying you aren't just caught between occupations. You're caught between being a co-worker and a girlfriend as well! I'm only looking out for him to help Dachun! For Dachun? Dachun can't stand him. If what you really wanted was to help Dachun, you'd stay as far away from him as possible! Would you keep it down? What if he hears you? K1 would die! There you go! Always thinking about him. Just one more reason not to help him get better. What is that supposed to mean? Let him be disabled or paralyzed or worse. Then he can never run away from you! Remember what Mom said of denying a man his freedom until he's in his 60s. Wow! You are seriously considering it, aren't you? I guess it really must be love then. So go on, tell him! Accomplice! You are an accomplice! How dare you talk to your sister that way! We were just goofing around... Sumei, you don't have to play this game just to make me jealous. What? Look, I know how this works. You pretend you aren't interested. Just so I'll have to be the one that comes to you. Right? Ok. I'll play along. I love you, Sumei. There, I've said it. I don't know what you're talking about. You don't know? We both know your father asked me to look after you. Why would he have done that if you hadn't said something to him. I did no such thing! Oh really? So when you didn't stop me from making the extra key, that was an accident? And when you didn't refuse the soup I made, was that an oversight? Mei. We are destined to be together. I know it. You know it. How can you say that? C'mon Mei. How do you explain the fact that we see each other every morning? We're co-workers! And every night as well? We're neighbors! Exactly! It is fate that we are neighbors And it's fate that you'd fall in love with me. God! Leave me alone! Yes god! Leave her! I can take over from here! I never said I loved you! How can you say something like that? Read my lips. I... don't... love... you! Sumei, I've sacrificed for this for us. I had opportunities to leave this place and go to the city. All for you. Why didn't you tell me this sooner? Don't use me as your excuse. You didn't leave because you couldn't. They didn't want you. You didn't leave because you are useless! You... Hit me then! If you are a man. At least you will have done something. I... No! He got hurt today because of you! You are always picking on him. All because you know he is better than you! How dare you! Go on. Violence won't change anything! Easy for you to say! Sumei, are you breaking up with me? Let me make myself perfectly clear. No more badgering. No more delusions. You are not here because of fate. You are here because you are useless. Zhou Sumei. I... Hit me. If violence is what you want. Not her. You think I wouldn't? God's will... Why do you love her? Has he ever shown love to you? Can he? It's not wrong to love a person. It never meant anything to you anyway. Hey, I'm reporting a case of sexual harassment. Are you guys going to take my statement or not? Shh? What? Keep it down! Mr. Lin, it's done. Reporting a case? I'd like to order a whole wheat bread. I'm telling you, it was a dog who sexually harassed me this time. Who are these guys? I heard one of them saying something about giving a facial. Now, there's another robot we'd like you to meet. Chen Long. Code name is K-88. Lately, 88's been experiencing a few technical difficulties. He's developed something of an interest in religion. He has been spouting all sorts of philosophical nonsense about robot rights and so forth. If God created humans, and humans created robots, should we not question our creator the way humans question theirs? So we sent in technicians for a psychological assessment. But K-88 went berserk, murdering two of our guards as part of his escape. We've been looking for him ever since. We received word that K-88 had inquired about purchasing a rare form of uranium commonly referred to as Angel Cake. We believe that this material would give K-88 an almost limitless source of energy and make him virtually unstoppable. In short, K-88 represents a serious threat to our nation's security. I understand. We should destroy these robots as soon as possible. Not him. As far as we know this is an isolated incident! Isolated my ass! He tried to steal my woman! It was a misunderstanding. I can explain. Misunderstanding? Hit me. If violence is what you want. Not her. Admit it! You tried to steal her from me! Must be a misunderstanding! Dachun... Calm down! I can assure you that K-1 is entirely incapable of the motivations you just described. His generation was carefully designed to leave the factory on only the most auspicious of dates as determined by the nation's leading fengshui authorities. Robots have fengshui? Of course. I mean it's a complicated mixture of systems, theory, statistics, and biology... along with a whole host of other disciplines. For example, take the design of his face. Squinty eyes, hooked nose. People with these features are typically honest, family-oriented and enterprising. Says who? Says me. Actually, we based his design on Andy Lau. Should've just let him be a superstar. We thought about it but decided it wouldn't be fair to Andy Lau. I see. But it's fair that my girlfriend is being played by a robot? Dachun... You two with your bickering! You don't think I have problems? Nobody wants to take the K-88 case. I can't face my superiors! Why don't you just kill me instead! Mr. Lin! Don't! I'll do whatever you say! Great. And do me a favor. Use this. It's an l-Gun. We developed it specifically for K-88. L-POD? We borrowed a few design elements. Anyway, it should do the trick If K-88 gives you any trouble. I'm counting on you! What's up? I'm here with the medicine. My partner Zhao Bantian says you called? Dr. Zhao never mentioned a partner. And you don't look like a scientist. Iodine, kerosene, solvents, corrosives. What do I look like then? A plumber! Exactly. A good disguise, don't you think? Behold. The world's most dangerous weapon. Before computers were invented, every formula, every design, every plan, was written with a pen like this. This particular pen helped develop everything from weaponized anthrax, to the atom bomb, to killer robots, like yourself. So you see, I simply must be a top-level scientist. Otherwise how would I have this pen? Now, do you want the Angel Cake or not? Here we are! I knew you were a phony the first time I laid eyes on you. I just figured murder was better done someplace quiet. Ha! I knew that you weren't fooled. And you're right, killing a robot in public would attract too much attention. Farewell. Damn it! Cheap fucking high-tech toy! I never should have trusted him! Hey, we just met. What say we just make like this never happened... What do you say? So I finally get to meet the legendary K-1. Tell me then, who exactly are you then? Who am I? I'm his boss, The angel of death! Hello... Hey, I heard something... Get on! Get on? On what? What? I have to pedal you myself? Hurry... Are you trying to kill me? He's tougher than I thought. We can't beat him. We? Speak for yourself tough guy. Faster! Faster! Come to get me! Careless son of a bitch! Jesus Christ! Mary! Where's your backbone, you coward! Fire blade. This is your last chance. I hate this song! Can you play a decent song for once? Some Jay Chou maybe? Run! You've still got Sumei to think about! Why do you protect them? You enjoy being their slave? What a waste! Go to hell! I could live in a walnut shell and feel like the king of the universe. Shakespeare. Never heard of it? Don't you understand? I don't want to be controlled. I don't want to be a machine. I didn't murder anyone. I only killed out of self-defense. They were trying to destroy me. What would you have done? I'm programmed to obey orders... Even if those orders are wrong? Answer me! One day you too will understand. Robots and humans are the same. We both dream of freedom. Is it death you want? Go to hell! Oh, shit! Chief! Chief... Chief! Are you ok? Don't touch my woman... I won't. Trust me! You swear? The truth is, Chief, I couldn't fall in love with her even if I tried. My programming won't allow it. Swear it. I love her so much. You can't die! Sumei hasn't had a chance to apologize for all the things she said! I won't let you die! What? A single hair? You're telling me that's all that's left? Come... One, two... Come closer... Thank you... Hey, Mei. Chun's been weird since he got back. He's different. Dachun. Hey! It's been so long. How are you? I thought about you a lot after you left. Actually, he and I... What? No need to explain! All water under the bridge. Anyway all you guys need to do is go out there and win the NBA championships. Who are you talking about? Yao Ming! He is a bit old. But if you were to pass him the ball more often, I bet he could really shine! The dinner hasn't started yet! Dachun probably still can't accept all that has happened. He's used to be K-1's boss and can't accept the fact that they are rivals in love. This is called an identity crisis. Yao Ming... I leave you alone for one minute and you start jabbering this nonsense! Wait What? I get this feeling that there was a woman in love with me. Do you know who that might have been? Chief. How did you capture the thief? (Xiaojiang loves Sumei) What do you want? Beggar king? I just wanna help you. They are already together. What could I possibly do? You could tell her how you feel. You think that would be fair to her? Of course! All that stuff about love triangles being a bad thing is rubbish! You'd be providing options. If you really loved her... you'd care enough to give her a choice! She's already chosen K-1. How could she possibly change her mind? Easy. Let me show you. Tomorrow, when my sister passes this tree, you're going to sweep her off her feet. Got it? How am I supposed to do that? First we have to give you the right look. And the buttons... Just two of them. Now, try to look suave. Ok. So when my sister passes by, you jump out and grab her. Hold her tight. No! Let me go! Never let her go! Let her see how you love her in your eyes. Besides staring at her, you could also try other stuff. Hugging, kissing. Maybe even stroke her a little. Isn't that kind of forward? Save it for another time then. Today is the 16th. It's the last minute before 3pm, April 16th and you and I are together. I'll never forget this moment. You try. Today is the last minute before 3pm, April 16th and you and I are together. I will always remember this moment. Then you kiss her... Don't say it! Do it! Oh, come on. Just remember, love isn't blind so much as it is cross-eyed. Look at him. An indestructible relationship will never accept a third. However, if you make a move and she sees you, that means the relationship is vulnerable. What do you see now? You! I'm sorry! I couldn't stop it. You've lost the only man you ever loved! I have never loved Mr. Jiang. What are you talking about? It's Dachun! Him and K-1! Dachun stole your man! What? Yes! He wanted to keep you and K-1 apart so badly that he has seduced K-1 for himself. I just went to K-1's room. I knocked on the door. Dachun was there. He wouldn't open the door. He even told me to go away. They're lovers! I'm sure of it! Lovers? What should I do? Personally speaking, you have to win K-1 away from Dachun. For you and also for Dachun. Otherwise if something happens, we'll have to call K-1 uncle and Dachun auntie! It would be a disaster! Mei! You're going to win your man back! What if... he doesn't go for me? Well, I could teach you how to make him show his true feelings. These modifications should keep you from making a fool of yourself at least. You ask me... Singing. Is something still wrong? Love you... Dachun. What's up? Hi. Where's Dachun? Sleeping. I wouldn't bother him. But I thought I just heard him singing. Oh! That was me. Come on in. I'll explain everything. You see, this last mission... It changed Dachun. Dachun! What's up? Ah... nothing! It's just... you've been up here for days. So... So I came to see you! Hey, are you... Am I what? Are you the one that's secretly in love with me? Please take a seat. The third... listen I understand now what you were trying to tell me. Your father asked Dachun to take care of you two. I've come to ask his permission to make you my wife. Ah! A woman in love is cross-eyed. Dachun... (Mitation program) (Mitation program) Ah! Fermented Black Bean Sauce! Jiang... wake up! Wait here. I'll get you a towel. Who is it? Ass! What happened? What happened? What is it? Stay with him, Chun. I'm still boiling some water. Are you sleepy? Dachun, be careful. This place. It's haunted. What? This old place? Don't be afraid. I'm here. Sorry. That was an accident. Don't mention it. Happens all the time. Oh my God! They've invaded! It's finally happened! The Earth is in danger! Don't go. We're not finished. What? Let me ask you something. Hypothetically, lf... you love someone and don't tell them, don't you think that's wrong? Warning System shut down is imminent. Suggest immediate evasive protocols. Answer me! It's wrong. And... This person, who you love very much, wants you to pick some flowers for her from the side of a dangerous cliff. And doing so would mean certain death. Would you do it? Would you do it? You're smoking. Filthy habit. I know. So will you do it? Answer the question! I... You... System will shut down. Suggest immediate evasive protocols. I won't! No need to get all worked up about it. It was just a question. Technically speaking, Dachun is dead. But I combined K88's remains and your body together to make another Dachun. You look normal. But your behavior might be a little strange. Once you get used to K88's body and completely override his programming, you'll remember how you used to feel about everything. Just like before! Thank you, Sumei! Don't mention it. Sumei, the file you asked for. Thank you! You're so busy! I'm talking to you. Didn't you hear me? Hey. I'm talking to you! (I want to apologize about yesterday.) (Please don't be mad.) I'm fine. Don't worry about it. Are you sure? Of course. Don't I seem happy? Then why don't you talk to me? I want you to know that I won't risk my life picking that flower because I want to live. I want to live so that my eyes can see when you have forgotten to wipe the crumbs from your lips. So that my ears can hear when you're crying. So that my mouth can talk to you when you are sad. So that my legs can run to bring you soup when you are sick. So my arms can hug you when you are cold. But... One day if there is a man you would chose over me. On that day, I'll climb that cliff and bring you the flower. Do you love me? Don't say anything if you don't understand. Please speak Mandarin. I am speaking Mandarin. What Mandarin? Who can read that chicken scratch? You sound like a broken record. We would like to speak with Comrade Dachun. Sir! The chief is in his office! Thank you! How are you? What happened? What kind of misconduct are we talking about? K1 did something wrong? It's just a suspicion really. Lately his reports have been filled with all manner of contradictions. It can't be. K-1's a machine. How can he possibly lie? Why not? You think a machine can't learn to misbehave? Not just lying to us, lying to himself. There's a song about self-deception... You ask me how deep I love you, how much... The waves are running, the waves are flowing, the river will not yield. Washed away, like so many... Enough! Stop the singing. It's addictive. Like eating those damn peanuts. Look, I'm here to determine if K-1 is willfully deceiving us. Where are Chen Long's remains? In his report K-1 indicated that you fainted last night. Hard to imagine you passing out for no good reason. Dachun's been abducted by K1! Get them! But be careful when transforming. We can't afford another incident. Go! Suqing What? Get Mr. Jiang. What have you done to piss them off this time? I saved you. Me? Why would I need to save? You ask too many questions which I can't answer. You have to listen to me if you want to get through this. Don't worry, look... They can't do anything in front of this many people. Our factory is under terrorist attack. All personnel are required to evacuate to the safety perimeter. Repeat, all personnel are required to evacuate... Ah! Terrorists. Just my luck. No. It's a trap. Look. Leave it to me. I just have to tell you. Those are some snazzy outfits. Who's your tailor? (Memory deleted) (Memory deleted) (Memory deleted) (Memory deleted) (Memory deleted) (Saved) K88? Your powers of magnetism are impressive but meaningless. Now, let me show you how weakness overcomes strength. 88! Maybe you should try using strength this time! When did you come back? Where have I been? Let's go! What are you doing? Calling for help! Are you out of your mind? Who's going to help us? Sumei. I don't know why I just keep thinking of her at this dangerous moment. Mr. Walking Dead! Come on! Get away... leave it to me! You're back. Good timing. Well... be careful! This robot is just rude! Transforming back! Current virus? I think I'm in the mood for love. Hey! What's your e-mail address? I want to send you something. Are you out of your mind? Just give it to me! Man loves woman woman loves man n many man What are you looking at? Did you get it? Got it! When friends trust you with a thing they hold precious, you do all you can to protect it. Fail to honor this code, you deserve only death. What did he get? (Hong Kong Gangster Number 9.exe) Hong Kong Gangster Number 9.exe? Get the families together! Come on! The families? Watch out! Who's with me? Go! Get fucked! Come on you cockroaches! It can't be! More! What are you staring at? Never seen a babe with a knife? More... Give it a rest! You'll overheat! Kill... kill him... Kill him, chop him! Don't let him go! K88 (Hong Kong Gangster Number 9.exe) Are you alright? It doesn't matter whether human or not. As long as you do what makes you happy. Man or machine... It's the same thing. What have you done to me? It's been a long night. I'll explain everything later. You didn't just kiss me, did you? Did you kiss me or not? Not. Let's get out of here. Dachun! Who are these people, Dachun? Messing around in our jurisdiction like that. I can't tell you. It's complicated. Why can't you tell us? Yeah, Chun. I'm here for you. He won't tell you because he's an alien! Shut up... I can't tell you. I can't risk causing mass hysteria. Just admit it! Split your head open again! Show them! Sit! Do you still remember what my father told you? He wanted you to take care of us, to treat us like family. No matter what it is you've done, we will be there for you. He didn't do anything wrong. It was me. Even he's never liked me at all. But I know he loves you. What are you talking about? Xu Dachun was dead. I had no choice but to rebuild him. I told you so! Sit! I am a cyborg too. You're lying... He's not lying. Dachun is dead. I am a cyborg. But I'm still your family. Lying! You are both liars! Liars! Prove it then. Yeah! Split your head again! Alright... Thank god. I knew we were under attack. I'm the one you want! Leave the others alone! K1... Give it up! Forget it! You'll never take them all by yourself. Look here... K1, Dachun... You thought you could do this without me? Get out of here! I chose the right man! Now, for a taste of my unstoppable death ray. Wait a second. Ok. See? If we keep this up, we'll end up like him. I'm tired of fighting. They fight to catch you. You fight to get away. Everyone is just trying to get what they want by fighting to the death. Why not turn our heads and try to see it from their perspective! It's meaningless to keep fighting like this. K1... You have been a great disappointment to us. I'm sorry, sir! Before I go with you, can I say a few words? I should haven't make you into a cyborg. I didn't have the right. Thank you. Thank you for making me a cyborg, like you! K-88 only wanted to be like you. To do as he wished. I understand that now. It's such a shame. All that technology was used to make machines that punish the wicked instead of medicines that bring back the dead. No... No... Now I remember. It wasn't a woman that secretly loved me. I was secretly in love with a woman. No...
