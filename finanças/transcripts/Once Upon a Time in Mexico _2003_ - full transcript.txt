Were you here in Mexico during the Barillo cartel massacre? No. Uhh. That's when I first heard about him. He was a legend. They used to say he was the biggest Mexican they'd ever seen.

She was with Marquez. And when Marquez saw that she was with the Mariachi, well, he went crazy. He hunted him down and fought Mariachi to the death. And then she... put a bullet in his heart. Only he didn't die. I don't know what happened after that. Would you like some? No. Maybe Marquez caught up with them, or the cartels. But like I said, the man is a myth, a legend. And if he's still living, he's the one you want. Well... that is truly unbelievable. Well, I'm not big on telling stories. Where's the money you owe me? That's the reason I'm here.
