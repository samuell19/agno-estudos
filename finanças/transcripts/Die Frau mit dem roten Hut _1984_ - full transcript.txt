Let me... Let me go! Let me go! Munich, 1923 Why don't you come to Germany? To Munich. Here you can feel like being in paradise. Here, a lot is offered to you. The Woman with the Red Hat Germany has lost the World War. And the revolution has failed, too. Germany has nothing left. Only freedom. Too much freedom. Everything here is in disarray. It's a paradise. You should come here. Here, everything is possible. Politics and culture are in chaos, like being paralyzed, Germany only lives in its expectation for rebirth. Here, it's only a matter of survival. You have to take advantage of that. Here, words are superfluous. The prices increase every hour. A handful of money is worth more than a suitcase full of Reichsmark*. {\pos(354,52)}*German currency at the time For a pack of cigarettes I can get every woman around. Why don't you finally come to Munich? That's what Tono wrote to me to Paris. Always the same postcard, the one with the airship. He wrote to me that he is feeling like being in paradise for real. Like in the old Japanese fairy tale of prince Hikaru Genji. Like him, he educates young girls to become women. Even in Munich he has found two of those "Wakamurasakis". He writes to me that I can choose one of them. Tono-san! Good night. It's hard to play the Japanese emperor. Oh, it's you. Since when have you been here, hm? - How are you doing, hm? - Not as good as you. Looks like you didn't have the time to come earlier to me, hm? Girls, it's finished for today. All right? Nice that you are here. I didn't expect that you really would show up. I was not sure if... Well, my boy. Peeping, that's pretty normal, in the country of the fall. Well, that's Weimar*. {\pos(354,80)}*In this period Germany was called Weimarer Republic, or short Weimar You can make dreams come true. Look at that. This woman here is sleeping with me for a pot of rice. Here, life is much more interesting than Brecht and Kaiser* ever described. {\pos(354,52)}*Two German novelists Believe me. Not to mention the herd of Kabukis. And me, as a future stage-author, what should I do, hm? I just remembered, among us writers, your novel, isn't that supposed to be finished soon? What does your editor say, hm? Well, the usual. Then you're going to be a real writer, hm? Let's stop this, okay? First, you should amuse yourself. You can have them. They are not bad. Something is not right with you. In Japan, you took every opportunity for an adventure. Tell me, are you loving another woman? These are the two girls I wrote to you about. Well, take them. Hm, so it is about another one? I understand. Everything is in dissolution. Freedom, take advantage of it. A woman for a pack of cigarettes. Glory to Japan! Don't you want to have a drink? I don't want to. What a pity. French-speaking people and dogs not allowed. Well, then I won't be talking French anymore, too. France and Japan should be ashamed... ...about defeating Germany. I can't stand winners. I take sides with the losers. - This here... it's mine! - No! - No... - It's mine! What should this mean? What kind of woman are you? I will take revenge... my way. There is no room for you. I don't understand German! This is my city. Let go of me. To me, women are an important part of my live, nevertheless, they are the source of all evil. I made it. I got a leading part. A leading part! Do you know what that means? I'm going to become a movie-actor now. I no longer have to play Brecht. I can't live off that in the long run. And when I become famous at the movies, I'm going to Hollywood. I'm getting out of Germany. I will get you later on, too Don't tell me a story And due to the shooting-start I always need to get up early in the morning. Therefore it ain't much handy for me to be living here. I found a very nice apartment close to the studio. I will be moving. Everything is finished anyway. Who is that? A Lunatic? I'm gonna chuck you out. So you already choose differently? Right on, I'm leaving. It has been almost six months. And we had a good time. I don't seem to exist for her. How can I tell her? Maybe it's too early, maybe not too much? They are training for the Six-Day-Race. They can make lot of money if they turn pro. His dream is to become that good to stand a Ten-Day-Race, he wants to reach his limit. Hey, you! Come here. You don't understand German? Take a ride! Come on! Actually I could be happy. Am I? I rented this house and suggested them to live here with me. I put both of them in a cage. The real master of the house, that's me. But that's not what I wanted. The red one can't leave her cage. She can do whatever she wants. And what about me? You are always close to me. That calms me. It doesn't make sense. I don't like that. It's senseless. Hmm... I'm not happy like that. Hey my friend, were you bored? Oh no... Don't look so disturbed. And now you have to do me a favor... the laundry. Wash mine and his, feel like being home. Can't she stop humiliating me on and on? Here. Now, on you go. Come on. I don't care sharing a woman with someone else, but he can't be too close to me. It would be better if he was a stranger. Open up! It's me! Open up, goddamn! Open up. I owe everything to those. It's all your fault. Your fault! It's all your fault, wake up, goddamn, everything is because of you! Enter here. Right. Hello, how are you doing? I didn't really take care about you, I'm sorry. Maybe you are feeling lonely? I brought someone with me for you. You're doing something pretty redundant. And by the way, you're doing nothing for him. Only for yourself. Don't start anything with this guy while I'm away training. And keep the door shut. That's none of your concern. It's my business. And by the way, I don't belong to you only. And then, bringing him this slapper. I do like you. It's only for your benefit. Try to understand. I must do all things possible for me. I must! If i win this race, if I win this 10-Day-Marathon, then I can go as a pro to Berlin. To Berlin! I'm giving back your woman. And your laundry too. Open up! Open up immediately! Open up! Open up! Summer passes by and you can feel autumn. The fly before my eye makes me think about death. The fly will have to die. What am I saying? There is no reason to compare myself to that fly. Why did I ever listen to Tono? Why did I actually leave Paris? Life is... like the Olympics... ...only managed by lunatics. That's hot, hm? It's human to be wrong. God forgives, but humans make mistakes, which God can never forgive. Too much freedom... leads man to become an animal. Hey, hey, my sweeties arrived. Come here, sit down. Let me feel you. Hey, here I am. Sit down. Why are you looking so depressed? Seems your girlfriend has left you. You know, there are always plenty of broads. Here, you can chose them! Well, better drink up. Cheers. Hey, I need that glass for my friend. [sings drunken Gibberish] Enjoy life. I can take care of you. Come on, take one! There are so many around. Drink up! Cheers! Hey, listen up, I have to tell you something. Next time I'll offer you a show on an air-plane! People will be able to see me from earth. On a flying stage, I will collect many air-ships, and then, I'll constitute an Air-Ship-Reich. One Reich above Russia, one Reich above America and one over Japan! My air-ships... Ain't that great? Hey, are you a Nazi? A blonde Nazi? One, two, three, you have to enjoy life. If I deserve to get a woman anyway, tell me! Not that hard, from the beginning! That old slut! Nor did she wash herself and neither did she keep the flat in order. That's what she looks like! Must have been an awful slut. Even in these hard times she let bread get mold. Can you imagine? The cockroaches were all over the kitchen and in every corner were piles of rubbish. She didn't care at all if lice were crawling over the blanket, or chinches were eating holes into the mattresses. And still she believed she was a good one. I'm not gonna throw my cash out of the window, no, no. Come on, continue! - His hideout. - You slut! - You old bitch! - Whore! You... you piece of shit! You goddamn whore! Do you use another trick now? - With such crap I should go to Hollywood? - Witch! You are filled with dirty thoughts all the time! Believe me, no matter what, I can't stand this any longer! Believe me, I had the vision of rotting flesh. It still smells like you. This rotting stench of a cunt, the stench of a pig! Praise be thy ass! Carry on filming! Carry on filming, don't stop! Yes, sir! This is cinema! That's groovy! This scene belongs to the movie! They improvised all that! Don't we have a exciting subject that fits to it? This is gonna ruin the story. I have chosen the story of the small and sick masses. Yes, that's the sub-line! This means money, this is music! Carry on filming, carry on filming! Who is dead? Dead... You had such big dreams. Now, you are dead. I have to do my best. I must. You wanted to reach such a height, but you didn't make it. If I win this race... I'm sorry for you. Take the body to the yard. Come. Come on. Will you finally come? Forward. While living with the actor... I had an affair with the cyclist. And then... as I was living with the cyclist, I fell in love with you. I always felt torn in between. But, understand me, I never could have a choice. I love you. Where are you taking us? I'm starting to hate myself for doing as you please. That's nice. Welcome home. Good day. They would have said that we don't need him now and that he should leave us be. I inherited this castle from my father. I come from a noble family. My father is dead, so is my mother. Just like the cyclist, who once tried so fast to reach the hereafter, both of them died during the war, during the revolution. Revolution? Yes, although they never had anything to do, with the war and the revolution and that sort. And I had two brothers. But they were thugs. They were always different from the norm, and migrated from Germany after the war. To Chicago. That's where they established their names, and got killed in a gang-shooting. This happened six weeks ago. I'm not familiar with Chicago, but I like the city. A cemetery of my brothers. I like it. Talking with someone... ...who doesn't understand me. Maybe it's good, not being understood. Then I don't have to answer any questions. You are the first one I took to this place. I feel good with a person like you. In inner peace, you know? I feel safe. Otherwise, I can go nowhere. I don't know where I would prefer to be. I mostly prefer to be alone. That's why... I like you. Cunt! Piece of shit! Listen to me. It doesn't matter... ...who else is around. I won't untie myself. I you don't do it, I will stay seated here. I could always be with you. I'm glad. What did you say? I'm glad, but, it's no good... What are you saying? It's... no good. It makes... ...no sense. No sense. Why not? It is... no good. Not good, not good. You said you are glad. Why did you do that? Tell me. Abnormal. I can't... see that. Embrace me... with both your legs. Did you do that... ...because you didn't want to hug me. No. I want all of that, to start again from the beginning. Don't you understand? Stop. Why do you want to untie me? As you jumped off the coach, as you wanted to run away fro me, that's when I followed you, to not let you get away. Now I have to put you to the test. Sieg Heil! I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose. It was a unintentional, you have to believe me. I know. A princess... loves... a carpenter. She has his ears cut off, but... he says nothing, She also... let cut off... his arms. She already called the majordomo back. Are your arms tired or what's going on with you? Will you continue? Goddamn, what the heck is going on?! Go on! Let's go! Crawl. You lazy bastards! I... am still here. What's this, hm?! Crawl further! Still here... Don't you... ...hear me? It's all over. So, yes. "I will destroy the history of both of them." "Jane, I love you - don't you ever want to marry me?" "We, Queens, shouldn't follow the laws of our hearts." "He is Caligari!" Oh, may I help you? I can't understand what such a beautiful woman is looking for in this damned Munich. He makes a fool of her in the castle. He wasn't good enough for her. But you, I knew that one day you would arrive. I know that I feared you, that you are gonna take her away from me one day. Jump! You already did it once. She always searched for her dreams. I was much more realistic. I followed a woman... ...who was always in search of herself. Or... ...did I follow a dream? Or... ...she was more realistic... ...and I was the dreamer? Or... ...were we both supposed to run to ruin? Yes. We have ruined ourselves. All my letters and postcards were returned. I didn't hear anything anymore from Japan. Also, I didn't receive any more money. And without money, life is worth nothing. Tokyo has been totally destroyed by the earthquake. Maybe I have no one who will read my last letter. Father, mother and brother, they are all dead. Everything is destroyed and ruined, so is my life.
