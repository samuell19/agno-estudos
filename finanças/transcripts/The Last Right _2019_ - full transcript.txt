Hey, on that note, good morning, New York. Has anyone seen that Christmas tree, the one up in Gramercy Park? Get your asses down there now if you can. You might need some coffee. It's got red, white... Hi, Mum. Who's this? What? ..your response to 17.1, to get this deal across the line. You'll be on your cell phone, right? Flight 164 to Dublin, please proceed to Gate 27 for boarding. Welcome aboard this Air-É flight to Dublin. Our flight today is six hours and 11 minutes. Uh, this is me, I'm told. Thank you. Your seat belts must be fastened at all times when the "fasten seat belt" sign is on. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Captain Murphy here. We are approaching a bit of turbulence, so I'm going to switch the seat belt signs on for a while. Sit tight, enjoy the flight and I'll let you know if there's any development. Are you going home for the Christmas? Are you going home for the Christmas? My mother's funeral. Oh. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm doing something similar myself. My brother... he's in with the luggage. I'm sorry for your loss. Ah, I lost him a long time ago. We hadn't spoken for... 30 years. I always imagined him, you know, with children... ..and grandchildren. It was three weeks before anybody found him. He was in his kitchen. They put him in the ground with no funeral, no headstone, no nothing, not even a grave. Just a white stick for him and the hundred others that he was lying with. I mean, nobody deserves that, do they, huh? - No. - No. All I can do now is bring him home. We can be together in death if we weren't in life. The first right thing I do for him and it's the last. - What was his name? - Thomas. Tommy. Oh! - I'm Pádraig. - Daniel... Murphy. Would you go away out of that! Murphy is my name! What are the chances? Fairly high. And where is home? - My mum's from Clonakilty, Cork. - Oh. Was. Um... My brother's still there. That's the strangest Cork accent I've ever heard. I'm not from there. - I grew up in Boston. - Oh. The captain has switched off the seat belt sign... - Um... would you excuse me? - You want to get out? - Yeah. - All right. Right, off you go. All right. Thank you. - Sorry. - Right. We will shortly be commencing our in-flight duty-free service. A reminder for those of you with non-EU passports to please fill in the landing cards. Those with EU passports, please check now that you have them. Anyone looking for an Air Touch ticket, please ask a member of staff. Excuse me, miss? What do I fill in here? Your next of kin, sir. Your wife or your son, that kind of thing. Right. Tray table up, please. Your seat belt, sir. Can you tell your father too, sir? Mr Murphy? Oh, God. Excuse me. He's dead. Are... Are you sure? Well, he's not fucking breathing. OK. Don't move. You'll both need to stay in your seats. We'll get you a blanket. - Is that man dead? - Don't worry yourself, sir. This is Captain Murphy. We're going to have to circle... - What's the matter with him? - Well, he's not breathing! - Are you sure? - Just give him a fucking blanket, Sinéad. - So you're sure you're no relation? - Yes! I'm sure! Please, I... I'm gonna miss my connection. But why would he have you down as his next of kin if you weren't? I don't know. Keep your baggage with you at all times. Any unattended baggage will be removed and may be destroyed. Daniel. I'm Frank. We spoke on the phone. Yeah. - He's asleep. - Thank you for watching him. - Is he OK? - I don't know. See, I didn't know what to say to him, so... ..so I Googled it and um... The website said it's... it's important to be as clear as possible, you know? And um... And so... You and Mum... - You were... - We were friends, yeah. Ah. Well, we were more than friends, Daniel. Erm... I was her solicitor. And then we started to... Louis? Hi, Louis. It's coat weather. You know... it was peaceful, Louis. It wasn't like Dad. She died in her sleep. Sarah's gone forever. Yes. Now there's just you to look after me. Yeah. And... you're gonna come to New York. - To live with me. - No. That's not a fact. Yes, Louis. It is. Breakfast is at 8:45 on a holiday. It's... ..9:37 now. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Shit! The customer was sending a deed of sale back to the ex. Then she have too much to drink and included something she now regrets. I've done it myself. The drunken text. Never posted, though, no. Uh-huh. Yeah, welcome here, thanks a million. All right, yeah, OK. OK, bye, bye, bye, bye. No. I'm sorry, Mary. It's already left the depot. I can still fix this. OK. - How you doing? - If... How are you, Seamus? Thank you. Please, Louis, it's just an expression. - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault! Jesus, Louis. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no, I'm sorry. Yeah, I could fly to America for that price! I'm in work, I gotta go. Sorry about that. Hi. When my mum died, I didn't want to talk to anyone either. I'm so sorry for your loss. - I'm so sorry, Frank. - Thank you. Frank said Sarah would want us to celebrate her life. Celebration's happy. This is my happy shirt, Mary. OK. Well, I like it, Louis. I'm sorry for your loss. - I'm finished with the funeral now. - Not coming to the grave? - Is it home-made? - What? No. Louis, we have to talk about what's gonna happen on Sunday, 23rd December. You're gonna get on a plane to come to New York with me. - That is not a fact. - Yes, it is. I've got you into a great school. It's the best school on the East Coast for... ..um... Autistic people? Yes. I'm in a normal school. And look where that's getting you. I don't get on aeroplanes with arseholes. What the fuck just happened? Garda down. Garda Sheila O'Neill. Sending coordinates. Are you all right? Shit! God, I am... I'm so sorry. I have no idea what happened. I was just trying to make soup and... I dropped the spoon in the mixer and it just... ..it just exploded. I think I might have to write this up. Was it your first time using a mixer? Can I ask you what you're doing in our driveway, Garda? Mr Murphy. I'm afraid... I have very sad news about Pádraig Murphy. Oh, for fuck's sake! Listen, it's not you. But I've explained this many times already. I don't know the guy. I was just sitting next to him in the plane. We found this um... on him. I think it's a picture of him and his brother. It just says here that you're his next of kin. Is there anything I can sign to clear this up? - Um... I'll look into that. - Great. It's my first week assigned to a station. I'm in my second year. I'm a trainee Garda. Shh... Can't believe this. - Anyway. - What's gonna happen to him now? I think we'll wait a year and a day to see if anyone claims him. No-one will. He has no-one. It was a long flight. Then he'll be buried by Cork County Council in a year. Cork? - He's from up north. - They sent him here for you, like. And they cannot... send him back? Jeez, no budget for that. Anyway, thanks again. Sarah would've helped him. What's with calling her Sarah? Louis? Garda! Garda! I can arrange to get him sent home. - You're lovely. - It's just a couple of phone calls. Father, please. I've called every funeral home in Cork. They're all saying the same thing - they can't get him to you until next week. 11am on the 21st is his brother's funeral. Father, I tried my best, OK? Uh-huh. Get him here to me for then and they'll be buried together. Fuck's sake. What I'm trying to say is that's not gonna happen. No funeral home can get him to you until after the weekend. The 21st is his brother's funeral, do you see? Are you sure you can't postpone it just a few days? In a word, no. No, it's not possible. It'd be a shame to think that after all this, he'd miss his brother's funeral. I've an inkling he'd have liked the idea of Tommy and him being put in the ground together, mm? Sorry, Father, I have another call coming in. Yeah. Louis, can you get that? Hello, Mr Murphy? Garda Sheila O'Neill here. So, listen, I've checked the guidelines. And it turns out you don't need to have him sent anywhere. In fact, you'd get me in a lot of trouble if you did. I'm supposed to follow protocol. Is that OK? OK. OK? OK. Great. Thanks again, Mr Murphy. OK. Oh, come on, Eileen. It's just three hours out of your life. - No, Mary! - Any normal sister... There and back, it's six hours. I've three funerals this weekend. And any normal sister wouldn't drive you ten metres for that man. I just don't understand what you think you'll achieve by going. Well, in an ideal world, I'd get there in time and intercept the post. And in the real world? It's nice of those two brothers, helping him. Whatever that thought is, Mary, nip it in the bud. There's plenty of work for solicitors in Cork. I could have a word. I could introduce you. No. Thank you. But I'm about to make partner. At least I will if I ever get back to New York. - Fair enough. - I have a huge deal closing on the 24th. So this school, do you think this is a good idea, do you? I do, yeah. I hear the teachers are brilliant. They have a state-of-the-art photography studio. I think your mum would think it was a terrible idea. Sorry. - And another thing - he'd miss Anna. - Who's Anna? - His girlfriend. - Anna. Look... I know your relationship with Louis is... ..complicated. What? I just mean... he needs to get to know you in his own way. On his own terms, you know? I mean, you come back once a year, for a couple of days... You're not his mum, Frank. Whatever, this has been very helpful. - I'll look over the papers later tonight. - Right. And he loves the McDaid's soup. If he tells you he only eats home-made, he's winding you up. Louis never ate home-made, ever. - Daniel. - Louis, I just need a minute. Mary said that she can loan you a hearse to drive Pádraig Murphy to Rathlin Island. - Who is Mary? - The woman who was nice to me at the funeral home where Sarah lay out dead. - She telephoned. - I'm not driving to Northern Ireland. - Why not? - Do you know how far Rathlin Island is from here, Louis? No, I didn't do Geography. But I did History. I got an A. Northern Ireland was created as a legal entity separate from the United Kingdom of Great Britain on 3rd May, 1921. - Really? - The Government of Ireland Act, 1920. Well, that's great. You see, this is us, Cork, and this is Rathlin Island. - I want to go to Rathlin Island. - You want to go there? I want to go to Rathlin Island. All the way across the country, there? But you can't have porridge at 8:45 if you're going to Rathlin Island. So too bad. Well, Sarah said to try and be flexible when an important opportunity presents itself. How is this an important opportunity, Louis? The way to tell if someone is your friend is to spend lots of hours with them. On a car journey, you spend lots of hours in a small space. I'm your brother. I am your friend. That's not a fact. Well, if I... If I drive him to Rathlin Island... ..will you get on that plane and come to New York with me on Sunday without arguing about it any more? Well... if I decide that I want to. No, Louis, this is the deal. If I drive him there... you'll get on a plane and come to New York with me. It'll make it much more likely that I will. OK, then. Deal? Deal. Jesus, Louis, this was your idea. You said you'd get in. Reality can be different from your expectation of it. I only ever travel in a Volvo. Louis, the Volvo is 19 years old. It's a Mercedes. Very safe. Well, the Volvo 940 has the best safety features of any car in its class, Mary. It's won awards. What the fuck is that? Cardboard. - What? - A customer had us order it. Eco-friendly, biodegradable. Wife saw it, she had a conniption, so he was buried in mahogany. It would've killed him if he'd known. - Anyway, it's all I have. - Great. Louis won't get in the fucking hearse and we've got a cardboard coffin. Where the fuck does that leave us? Are they canaries? No way, did you know you had a broken indicator? It's illegal to drive with a broken indicator. You know, since it's a good cause, I'd happily be your indicator. Provided we make a slight detour to Ballyskenagh. I have business there. Thank you, but I'm happy to make the signals myself. OK, but um... ..I'm actually a really good navigator as well. It's about 30 minutes out of your way. - Deal. - What? Deal, Daniel. All right, I mean, if you can share the driving, - we could make it back tonight. - Mm-hm. OK, much better for us to get back tonight, anyway. Great. Mary, Jesus, whatever you do, don't drive! Bye. You're fucked. It's broken. You can't touch my bag, Mary. Ever. OK, I won't. Do you know what? The two of you are kind of like Rain Man. Although, Louis, you're a lot less... Erm... Sorry, Louis, I didn't mean... Dustin Hoffman's portrayal is accurate in less than 0.0002 per cent of cases. All autistic people are different, Mary. Yeah, of course. So what do you do in New York? I'm a tax lawyer. - Do you like living in... - I have a girlfriend. Well done. What's your girlfriend called? - Jessie. - Jessie? - Do you live together? - I... I should concentrate on the road. What do you do at the... the funeral home? General dogsbody. I'm kind of in between things at the moment. I was working for Save The Children, in Dublin, and there's not many charity jobs going in Clonakilty. So for now it's just Save The Stiff, huh? Sorry, that was a bit insensitive. - Holy Mother of... - Can I help you, Garda? Erm... University Hospital morgue inform me that the remains of Pádraig Murphy are at these premises. - How's he looking? - Yeah. - Is he OK? - He's grand. Thank fuck. Are you looking forward to your new school? No. No. Hey, I think that's... Eileen, it is my life and I'm doing it. Wait, wait, wait, it's not about Br... Fuck. My sister doesn't think that the business that I have in Ballyskenagh is... good business. Right. The National Highway Safety Administration agrees that Volvo is the leading company in automotive safety. - It awarded it a prize last year, Mary. - Oh? I can't believe that you haven't travelled in any other car besides this, Louis. Oh, I have, Mary. - Seven times. - And um... ..why don't you like other cars? Because of dying. If that's Mr Murphy's intention - and we should always use an "if", Sheila - Rathlin Island is off the north coast of Antrim, as in the North of Ireland, as in the United fucking Kingdom. That's Mr Murphy's home. So that's where the other Mr Murphy's taking him. We need to sort this out before it becomes an international incident. - Oh. - We need to get our ducks in a row before they go waddling across the fucking border. Erm... Uh... If that's Eileen, will you just tell her that erm... - Hello? - Mr Murphy. Detective Superintendent Donall Crowley here. I understand that you've been made aware that, not being Mr Murphy's next of kin... - Jesus! - ..you have no right to move... First you harass me about being his next of kin and now you're gonna harass me about not being his next of kin? I can't keep changing my plans based on the whims of An Garda Siochána. The whims of An Garda Siochána? Sorry, Louis. - What's that banging? - Cars shouldn't bounce! - Do you want a tissue? - Yes, Mary. Mr Murphy, let me tell you the law is not bendable to your whims. I appreciate your call but I'm fine to get him there myself. Thank you. Fucking lawyers, Dad. I'd say your mum has got tissues in here somewhere. Oh. - Sorry, was that... - Thanks for that! It's lunchtime now. Remember what we said about being flexible, Louis? Lunchtime is at one o'clock on a holiday. - It's 2:28 now. I have been flexible. - Wow. Jesus, was that in there? I don't want to fucking see that. Let's just leave Mum's things be, all right? Just put it back. It's lunchtime now. Do they know your mum just died? OK, no, I'll look at it right away. That's fine. Right. Good. You know, I'm trying to explain to you that I cannot heat up your food. There is a microwave there, I can see it. - I'll pay you for the electricity for it. - It's not that. It's just soup. Yeah? It's messy. - 15.60. - Louis, will you eat it cold? - No. - Come on. 15.60, when you're ready, please. I've a lot to do. - Erm... - Have you the 60 there, please? - Let me see if I have some change. - Mary! No, sorry. No, no, no, no, no! - Not allowed in here. - Three minutes. - I'm asking you... - Mary... No, excuse me. Knight in shining armour, is it? No, no. - I want you to go now. - One minute 15 now. This is a fucking scandal! One minute 15, we're nearly there. - Daniel, do you need this? - Scandalous! Jesus! - Louis, what the fuck? - Take whatever you want. - There's 28 quid in the till. - No, no. That's our dad's old air gun. It's been broken for years. That's not appropriate, Louis! I fucking told yis! Fucking hell, Louis. Why'd you bring that? - For protection. - Protection from whom? You! You don't need protection from me. I'm here to protect you. Louis, I'm your friend, OK? Friends are honest with each other. What do you mean by that? Huh? Louis? If you think about it, it's the same as potato soup. It's just before the potato gets mashed up. It's a chip, Mary. Thanks for that, Mary. Mary. The Boston Red Sox baseball team texted. "Season's Greetings." That's nice of them. We had a great season, didn't we, Louis? Boston Red Sox won the 2018 World Series, Mary. - That's a big thing, is it? - Yeah. Are you kidding me? That's huge! Let's get tickets next season, Louis. We can watch the Red Sox beat the Yankees. Would you like that? Daniel went to Watertown Regional High school, in Watertown, which is in the greater Boston area, Mary. He won five medals for running. And his school was a 12-to 13-minute walk from his house. - Go, Daniel. - Thanks, Louis. I'm sure Mary wants to hear all that. He won 13 medals in Clonakilty Community School, which is where I go to school, Mary. - That's where I went! - It's a... a 13-to 19-minute drive, depending on traffic. So that's no time at all. Well, no, it's between 13 to 19 minutes, Mary. Oh, my God! You were the American kid that we all had to clap for in assembly. That was you! You were in sixth year and I was in third. Why did you move from Boston to Clonakilty? Because I was born. Louis, who told you that? Huh? - Dark soon. Bedtime. - Louis! You grew out of that. - Out of what? - He grew out of that. - Dark soon. Bedtime. - Louis, you grew out of that. - Daniel! - Hey! - Dark soon! - You fucking grew out of that! - Daniel's not listening to me! - Hey, stop that! - You grew out of that! - You need to pull over. - Can we stop? Daniel, pull over. - Hey! - Stop the car. - I can't. I'm on the freeway. He used to be afraid of the dark. He had to go to bed as soon as it hit. I think we're gonna have to find someplace. Fuck! My God, we're barely out of Cork. Here we go. The last two rooms. Double. And... the single. - Thanks. - Yep. Thank you. Louis, is there anything you want to say to me? Look, Louis. What? Jesus! For Christ's sake! I love you, Louis. I would never hurt... I didn't mean to do that. That was an accident. Is everything all right? Yeah, we're all right! He's fine. Is Louis OK? Yeah. I don't know what I was thinking, though. At this rate, it'll be next year before we get there. This is a nightmare. Thanks. - Shots for everyone! - Fáilte Abhaile, Peter! Fáilte Abhaile, Peter! I... - Fáilte Abhaile, Paul! - Fáilte Abhaile, Paul! - Cheers. Sláinte. - Sláinte. - All right, I'm good. I've work to do. - No, there's one more. 28th floor. - Where? - 28th floor. - No, but whereabouts? - Midtown. Where's that? So if New York doesn't feel like home and Clon doesn't feel like home, then where is home - Watersides? Watertown. Yeah, that's what I meant. Does New York not feel like home with Jessie in it? Do you know what? Don't worry. It'll feel like home with Louis there. Mary... ..about Jessie... Fáilte Abhaile, Michael! Get them into ya, Cynthia! Fáilte Abhaile, Paul! - No, no, no! - Yes, yes, yes, yes! - I'll do one, you do one. - Sláinte! Stop spinning! Sorry, sorry, he's been drinking. Er, so... Er... what about Jessie? Oh... There is no Jessie. I just said it as a reflex. Why was that your reflex? I don't know. I just thought you were a bit... A bit what? Keen. A bit odd. Fucking arsehole. - Mm. - Daniel. Jesus! Give me a minute. Ohh. Louis. OK, Pádraig. Yeah. You're OK. OK. OK... No, we're not OK. Don't ever mix your spirits, Louis. Although no amount of alcohol can excuse the fact that your brother is an arsehole. To say he's an arsehole is correct, Mary. To say he's my brother is incorrect. Sorry, what? What do you mean? Louis, this is coat weather. What does he mean you're not his brother? Louis said that? Um... Just... Just give me a minute. Daniel... What does he mean, Daniel? My parents adopted him. So? From my girlfriend. So you're his dad? This is more EastEnders now than Rain Man. Sorry. Are you OK? How... How'd you find out? That I was... - The truth. - Sarah was organising my new passport. And it wasn't spying because it's my birth certificate. Sarah is still Mum, Louis. Why do you need a passport? To come and visit you in New York. - You've never visited me. - That's why Sarah said we should. I'm really sorry. - What are you sorry about? - All of it. - I'm finished talking now. - Oh, come on, Louis, I... I didn't... Do you want a cup of tea or something? I think this is a great moment for you to take over the driving. I actually don't have my licence. What? You... You said yesterday you'd share the driving. Yeah, but in the grand scheme of revelations, it kind of pales in comparison. What are you listening to? Louis, what about your deal with Sarah that you wouldn't choose this song as your song of the day? Sarah's dead. Louis, how does song of the day work? Maybe you could pick another song? I download one song each morning, Mary, and it's my soundtrack for the day. So it has to be... ..reflective of ongoing events. Good news, sir. The priest confirmed they're on their way to him all right. - Aye. - Yeah. And what follows on the heels of good news, Sheila? Bonnie and fucking Clyde. It's a film, Sheila. Oh, shit. That was our exit. Ballyskenagh is back that way. You can't see a fucking thing. It's a gun. Have you heard of H fucking D? APB on Volvo. Partial reg: 95 Charlie. On the roof is a blue tarpaulin, covering a coffin. You can't miss this one, lads. I can just get out here. - No, I'll drop you off. - Please. His parents are funny about people driving up here. Stop. His mum hates people driving up here. Just stop. - All right. - Stop the car, stop, stop! OK. Be back in just five minutes. Who are you texting, Louis? Anna. Have you... told her about Mum, about... Sarah, yet? She's on her holidays. Jesus, Louis, you have to tell her. Otherwise she might find out through someone else. That'd be weird. Why? Because relationships are about sharing and supporting each other. And if you cut her out of this... It's... I don't know. It's just weird, OK? Just tell her. - Hiya. - What's up? - Did you bring the sale deed? - Yeah. I need you to stop fucking with it, Mary. Mary, what... Everything OK? What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Here, you can have that. I have loads. That is not appropriate, Louis. That's not appropriate! Just drive and smile. Gardai are investigating an alleged incident in a takeaway establishment outside of Fermoy yesterday at 2:45pm. The incident involved a local man being held at gunpoint by armed aggressors. The Gardai released CCTV footage of the man and woman shown here. Do not approach them. They are armed and dangerous. What could you have possibly sent him that was so bad? Hm? I remember signing the sale agreement where I was supposed to. I remember dating it. - I remember drawing on it. - Drawing? Drawing what? Oh, my God. Well, it wasn't flattering to Brian and it was not PG. Then I wrote some things. Christ, I should be locked up. Will it still be useable? What, legally? Yeah, from a legal point of view, absolutely. So that'll be in the file in the bank? Yeah. Oh, God. Oh, I can't breathe. - Hello. - Fuck! D-Daniel, what the fuck are you playing at? - Frank? - Have you lost your mind? Oh, my God, I'm so hungover. - I need some Hula Hoops. - All right. Thanks. Yeah. We're being charged with armed robbery and illegal possession of a corpse. - Excuse me? - Game over, guys. We're going home. - What happened to our deal? - You didn't hear what I said, Louis? What? Maybe he has drugs in the coffin. Maybe... he even has them stitched into the... Oh. Here. - Hello? Detective? - Hello. This has all been such a misunderstanding. Look, Detective, tell us where to go and we'll go straight there. Tell me where you are and I'll come get you. So now you're offering me a lift? - I'm not leaving you with Butch Cassidy! - No, it's fine. He's actually... - Actually what, Mary? - Absolutely. - ..really lovely. - Oh, Jesus. Probably be there in, like, an hour? Dark soon. Fuck! Dark soon. I think my auntie lives near here. Louis, cut that out. We need to turn ourselves in, this is serious. Dark soon! You know, we could always stop. And visit your fucking auntie, Mary? Is that what you're suggesting? - Daniel's not listening to me! - Louis, not today. - Jesus! - Oh, for fuck's sake! Louis! Louis! It's dark soon and you're not listening when I say that. Louis... Mary! Oh, Auntie Meg, it's so nice to see you. You're famous. We saw you on the news, Mary. Who's this guy? He's a gingerbread man? And are these edible? You can eat these? - Happy with that? - What about that one there? Have the plate. Grab that one up there. Are you... Are you gonna be OK here? All right. - Good night. - What happened to our deal? Well, Louis, things have changed since we made our deal. I didn't know we'd get in trouble for bringing him. I'm... I'm a lawyer. I can't get charged with anything. - Louis... - Good night, Daniel. Good night. I like the hair. Mary? - One mattress or two? - Two! Jesus! Sorry. Mary, it's for you. It's the cops. - So this is carte blanche? - Of course not, no. Just asking for your understanding. He'd get upset if we wake him or make him travel tonight. It's convenient, Mr Murphy. All of a sudden, you have your brother's best interests at heart. Up till now, you've been content to drag him all over the country, wasting Gardai resources on a wild fucking goose chase. - Please, he's afraid of the dark. - Two seconds. I'll ask him. He'll give you his statement in the morning. Sorry. CUH Morgue say they can have a van here for eight tomorrow morning. Oh, OK. Yeah. That's fine. - Yeah. - Great. And we'll go wherever you want us to go first thing in the morning. Oh, Jesus. You do not leave this house. Understood? Yes, sir. Absolutely. Daniel, you are my father. Hey? Hey? How are you? Ohh! I am so, so sorry. She's like the baby Exorcist. I'll ask Auntie Meg if she's got something you can wear. - Yeah. - There's um... - There's... - Oh. - I think you got it. - Yeah. Fine. I'm doing a poo! - Sorry. - We'll be out of your way. That's OK. Right. Now, come on, lads, bedtime. Come on. - Bedtime. Night, yeah? - Night. It was nice to meet you, Daniel. Santa can hear and see you, you know. Sorry. I haven't done... this with anyone... - ..except Brian. - Seriously? Yeah, my mum put the fear of God into me that I'd get pregnant, so he was my first and then we just... stayed together. She sort of had a point, you know? Speaking of... Oh, Je... Shit. - Probably should have taken Louis'. - Give me one minute. I'll be right back. Just put a top on. Ohh! Fuck. Yes! OK, I know sex education in our school was bad but... I gave my mum this for her birthday. It's lovely. I was 12. That makes sense. She still used it. It's all right. It's OK. - What time is it? - We don't have to get up yet. You OK? You don't think I'm awful? No! God, no. It must have felt awful, though, at the time. Did you ever get that feeling as a kid... when you got in trouble and... ..it just felt like the whole world was gonna end? I mean, we had to move, we had to leave Watertown and... ..Louis never seemed to stop crying. If I tried to help, Mum would tell me to go do my homework. I'd... I just... I don't know. Did you have Mr Ryan for Geography? Sure, no wonder you thought the world had ended, so. Did you ever talk to anyone? - Like a counsellor? - What happened with your ex? Oh, fuck me, smooth deflection. We were together... ..ten years. And then it just started to get shitty. He said we should break up. But he couldn't afford to move out and we couldn't afford to sell the flat. So we just stayed living together. That was hard enough. And then... Yeah, yeah, listen... ..he started bringing other women back. Wait, while... While you were there? I haven't... told that to anyone. Except Eileen. Hey. Oh... I saw nothing! Where did you move the car to? Louis? Daniel! He left his coat. Come on, Mary! - Daniel, just don't let her drive. - I won't let her near. Have you got your phone and everything? She's a liability. We'll fill her up before we bring her back. Thank you so much. - Hello? - Louis? - Hello, Mary. - Hi. Erm... Er... whereabouts are you? Well, I can't talk on the phone because I'm not very good at driving. Bye, Mary. Oh. He won't be able to handle the motorway, Mary. He just won't. Hi, Louis. Hi, Louis. Can you stop the car? No, I have to practise my driving. Why? I'm taking Pádraig Murphy's remains to Rathlin Island so he can be buried with his brother. The police don't want us to do that. They told us. - Now, put your foot on the brake. - Sarah said that sometimes you have to do what you think's right, even though others say it isn't. I didn't know you knew how to drive. - Frank is teaching me. - Well, you're doing great. Just put your foot on the brake in the middle. Finished talking. I have to drive on the road now. What? No... - No, Louis! - What are you doing? Stop! - Daniel, move. - No, no, no, no! - Get out of the way, Daniel! - Stop the car! - He's not frozen peas. - Are you doing this to punish me? It's not about you. Louis, nobody gave me a choice. He's not Green Isle garden peas, 450 grams. - Daniel... - Stay out of this, Mary! - Louis! - Daniel! Jeez, Louis... I need you to help me here. Sarah said that you only ever think about yourself. - She said that to you? - I heard her say it to Frank. "New York is a very big place to be if the only person that's looking after you is an arsehole." Louis, I'm not an... I'm not an... OK. OK. Let's... Let's do this together. All right? - OK? - Yeah. OK. Come on. Get out of the car. We'll do it together. Thank you. All right. Maybe we should take the van. The police are looking for this car. You don't know what time they left? No. APB on Volvo. - It's got a budgie coffin on the roof. - A coffin for budgies? No, not a coffin for budgies! A coffin with budgies on it! If you miss this, you're a shower of fucking incompetents. Six safety awards, Louis. Which is apparently unprecedented. Just gonna go around. It's easier to get in this way, anyway. - It's very high here. - Yeah, but the views are great. APB on second vehicle. - Yellow Toyota. - Yellow Toyota van. 1-6-1-Kildaire... 1-6-1-Kilo-Echo. ..7-8-9-6. Hi, this is Ger, don't leave a message, I won't listen to it. Contact Carla at the off... Do you know what? When I woke up this morning, I didn't think I'd be doing this. Now that I think about it, I can't live with myself not doing it. Louis - the most decent man in Ireland. Fuck. I'm just imagining Eileen's face when she hears. I'm not sure I want to picture Ger's face if I have to tell him I can't come in on Monday because I've been arrested for kidnapping a corpse. - It's gonna be fine. - It'll be fine. It'll be fine. Louis, Anna can come visit you in New York any time and you can go see her. A long-distance relationship isn't a real relationship. We're gonna make it work. - OK, Louis? - Mary. You look at Daniel like Anna looks at me in photos. Jesus, thanks for that! Stop. Sarah said Daniel's never had a proper girlfriend. Really? Never? - Not since... - Katharine Reynolds. Katharine Reynolds is a physicist. Really? Go, Katie. You're really talented, Louis. Why didn't you want to be my dad? Would you be my dad if I was normal? Louis... It had nothing to do with... We didn't even know you were... - Different. - Different. In the most amazing way. You know, you'd sit for hours with me when I was studying, in your own little chair beside me. What other three-year-old could do that? You got me through the exams. Louis, listen to me, OK? We were in high school. Her parents put a lot of pressure on Katie, your biological mum. And we were 15. Aretha Franklin was 13 when she had her son. - She raised him. - OK. Katie was gonna put you up for adoption. And Mum - Sarah - thought this would be best for all of us. So... I'm really sorry. Would you like to meet Katharine? Louis? - No headphones for a minute. - Finished talking now. If my brother hadn't spoken to me in 30 years, I'd turn in my grave if I thought I'd be buried beside him. So you're saying Daniel should stay out of it and let Pádraig Murphy be buried in Cork? Oh, my God, they're talking about us! ..whatever his name - Daniel, is it? Just buried his ma a few days ago. So maybe it's like his reaction to her death. He should see a counsellor, Joe, not go running around the bleedin' country. You might have something. But I understand he's with his brother. - Do you know what? - What are you doing? I'm sick of this. Someone has to defend us. If a charity did this, there would be absolutely no questions asked. And there should be a charity to do this. What's gonna happen to the next Pádraig? I'm gonna say that. Seriously, from a legal point of view, anything you say... Don't, don't, don't. Mary, just give me the phone. Louis, take the phone. - Anything you say will... - Mary, put your seat belt on. Take the phone! - Take the damn phone! - Pull over. We're the ones taking Pádraig home. Hello? - Sir, they're on Joe Duffy. - Very good, Sheila. You need a sense of humour to survive as a Garda. - Sir, listen. ..trying to do, Joe. Otherwise he's gonna be buried in an unmarked grave miles from home. Exactly what he was trying to save his brother from. But Daniel only met him on the plane, right? I mean, what business is it of his? That's just the type of person he is. He's kind and thoughtful. - Mary! - Even if he doesn't seem it at first. Hang up the fucking phone! Apologies, everyone, for that language. I'd like to remind Daniel, this is daytime radio. We shouldn't... I'll say this for her. She knows how to pick them, God love her. - A bit of Christmas spirit, please. - Mary, hang the fuck up now! Phones are lighting up with the story of Pádraig and his brother Tommy. Mary, I have Detective Donall Crowley on the line. Folks, listen, we have a live hostage negotiation. A hostage negotiation? You're joking me! This is a rescue! Would you call them fugitives, Detective? We need legal advice here. - It's no negotiation! - Fucking listen to me! Surrender Mr Murphy's remains immediately... - Give me the phone. - Just one second. ..or you will be charged with obstruction of justice and preventing the lawful burial of a corpse. We're trying to bury him, you fucking gobshite! Please top up your credit. - Thank God for that. ..buried in a trench. That's what New York Council does! We would do better for him than a cardboard box. Cardboard caskets are eco-friendly and they're not fucking cheap! It's a radio, Mary, not a phone. They can't hear you. ..wondering whether Pádraig Murphy's body is going to make it to his... The nerve of them. - So give us a call. - The arrogance. Noble act or a shocking crime? I have to say I'm with Daniel and Mary on this, not on the cardboard... Are they not, in their own way, trying to do a decent thing? Why don't you come back to me with your opinions when you're more than a fucking week on the job? - How are ya, John? - Donall, how are ya? - Is it that shower again? - No IRA involved this time. - Thank fuck for that. - As far as we know. Whatever you need, Donall, the PSNI is at your service. Well, don't shoot, sir, they're not armed! It's Northern Ireland, Sheila, not fucking Mexico. "Don't shoot." Father, I promise you, it's not political. It's all been a misunderstanding and um... it's sorted out. Whatever it is, we've got reporters asking a million questions. That was not part of the plan, Father, believe me. Well... I'll wait as long as I can. Great. Thank you. Which, what with the weather and the light, will be four o'clock. Get him here to me for then. Good man. Shit, he said four. What time is it now? 2:05. We're bang on schedule. We're like three trains, aren't we, Louis? We're people, Mary. We're gonna make it. - Shit. - What? You weren't on the news, Louis. They don't know what you look like. 2-4-8-2. You can do this. - 2-4-8-2. - 2-4-8-2. - He'll be fine, right? - Yeah, he'll be fine. He does this all the time with Mum. Did it. All right, he's gonna be fine. Uh-oh. Shit! You all right? - Are we good? - It said cash only. Is he thick? I guarantee you he's ten times smarter than you. Do you take euros? - Are you thick too? - You little... - Da! - Do we have a problem here? Your son is being very offensive, sir. Pay no mind. He takes that from his mammy. Derek. Citizen's arrest, son. - Go, go, go, go, go! Run, Louis! - You have the right to remain silent! - Mary! Drive! - Anything you say can and fucking will be used against you in a court of law! You fucker! I'll break your legs! Come back! You have the right to an attorney! - Where the fuck is she going? - If you can't afford one, tough shite! Come here, you wee fuckers! - Mary! - Come back and let me hit you! Mary's not very good at driving, Daniel. Come back! I'll break your fucking necks! He's giving up. I've got to help Mary now. You keep running, you're doing great! Mary! Mary! - Let's switch! - Why? I'm doing grand. - Just hit the brake! - The brakes are broken! The brake is not the accelerator! - They're broken! - Mary! Fantastic Day PSNI just spotted them. This has now become an international incident. He's OK. I'm so sorry. Louis! Turn off that fucking song! I'm so sorry, Pádraig. No, Mary. I'm sorry. This all got way out of hand. Let's carry him. - What? - Let's carry him. - Louis, give us a hand! - OK. Just go up. Up. Push, push, push. Push, Mary. - Go up. - OK. - Yeah, like that. - Are we good? Jesus. Oh, God. OK. Yeah, like that. The Taoiseach's office is asking me about this. The fucking Taoiseach's office, Crowley! I was led to believe you're not a moron. Can you assure me of that? I need to hear you say it. - I'm not a moron. - Then sort this out, for fuck's sake! That is not the conversation I expected to have with the Chief Superintendent at this stage in my career, Sheila. Far from it. - Mary? - Yeah? Will you come visit me and Daniel in New York, like Anna, Mary? Uh, how long have you been going out, Louis? Three months, eight days, and five hours. - We're having sex, Mary. - What? You're having what? - Sexual intercourse. - Jesus! Three months and eight days is not a long time for you to be together to have sex. Mary, help me here, will you? Sex is better the more you know the person. She's my best friend. I have nine friends including Frank and Daniel. She's my favourite one. Well, you obviously know about contraception, which is good. Durex Extra Sensitive are rated most dependable. You need an off button. But in terms of sensitivity, reliability and comfort, the Crown Skinless Skin is unmatched and is used extensively in porn films. - We're talking about porn now? - Would you prefer to be a granddad? Not really, Mary, no. That's Rathlin. Slowly, slowly. Sorry, Pádraig. Where do you think the ferry is? We're fucked, aren't we? Just gonna take some photos. Be careful, Louis. Whoa. What do you think will happen to him now? Not too close to the edge! We saw you on the news. Do youse want a lift? This trailer has not won any safety awards. I know you can do this. Sarah would want us to help Pádraig, wouldn't she? - Come on. - Louis, I'm not driving, Helen is. Give me your hand. Just keep looking at me, Louis. And remember why we're doing this. Cos he's not a bag of Green Isle garden peas, 450 grams. Daniel, you have to tell me what Sarah told me on days I don't want to get out of bed and go to school. - I don't know it, Louis. - OK, I'll say it to you. She told me that everyone has negative thoughts and it's not just me. Some days they're a lot worse than other days. I just... have to overcome them. And then I get out of bed and go to school. Tell me that on the days I don't want to get out of bed and go to school. OK. Come on, Louis. Just grab my hand and then it's just one step at a... Urgh! We have another supporter. Someone's gonna loan us a boat. This is mad! Pádraig, your carriage awaits. All right. Would you look, it's the lads! Go on, lads, you're nearly there! Do you want to swim over to them, Sheila? You're an absolute fucking hero! You got him here at last! Good man, Daniel. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost... - Dark soon. - It's OK, Louis. Look at the sky. - Come on, lads! - It's gonna be OK. Let's be having you. You have to grab it from underneath. One, two, three, up we go. Straight up. There we go. That's it. Got him. This is the story of two brothers who were estranged in life now to be reunited... Father, my erm... Louis needs a quiet place. Would you have a quiet place for him? - Sure. - Come on, Louis. Two brothers traveling across Ireland to bury two brothers. This is James Casey, reporting live from Rathlin Island. Now back to the studio. I'm sure Pádraig wouldn't mind you using his house while we get things ready. He spent every penny he had to get Tommy home. It would've meant a great deal to him - what you've done for him, is what I'm trying to say. The less you know the better, Father. - Thank you. - Father. Come on in. We made it, Louis. - Daniel? - Yeah? How far is the drive from your apartment to my new school? Let's talk about all that stuff when we get back home. The drive to Clonakilty Community School was between 13 to 19 minutes, depending on traffic. Louis, we'll talk about it when we get back, OK? Is it less than 13 minutes or longer than 19 minutes? Because... I have my porridge at 7:55 on a school day. It's quite a bit longer. How many minutes longer? Longer than 20 minutes? It's about... three hours... ..to get there. That's too long. Yeah, but you see, the thing is, you wouldn't have to do it every day. - Putting me in a home. - No, Louis, it's not a home. It's a boarding school. It's a really good one. You're gonna like it. I knew Daniel would do this to me. I knew Daniel would do this to me. It's a really, really good school. Louis, you get to finish math, you can get ready for college. Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off! - Louis! - Fuck off! Just leave him alone. - No, no, no, no, no. - Stop! Please stop, Louis, please. Get away, please. - Give him some space. He needs space. - Yeah, I am. Go away. - It's not a home. - Fuck off. - It's a school. - It's OK. Just wait outside, will you? Daniel, would you just please get out? Did you hit your head? - Donall, how are you doing? - How are you? The sooner we get them buried, the sooner we get this crowd dispersed. Get them buried? I'm taking Pádraig Murphy's remains back to Cork with me. - Come on, Donall. Surely you're not? - Come on, John. Surely I am. And I'm arresting Daniel Murphy and that brother of his. Where are they? - Hello, Father. - Ah. I'm with Detective Crowley there. I'm Garda Sheila O'Neill. - I remember. We spoke on the... - We did. Hey. - I think he'll be OK. - Right, you're an expert now, are you? I'm sorry. I'm honestly just trying to help. Yeah, well, don't. It's none of your business. You think I'm an arsehole? This is what's best for him. I don't think... What? Say it, Mary. Don't get shy now. - What? - I'm just surprised. I'm just surprised that you think this is what's best. He should be in college. His teachers in Clon, they let him get away with stuff and he's smarter than anyone. I know. What's best for both of you is what I'm trying to say. Just leave me alone, OK? Daniel, it's gonna be OK. For fuck's sake, Mary, how can you know that? Huh? How do you know that? I don't know. Does it... Fuck. Does it feel like that this is a good idea? Yes. Yes, what else am I supposed to do? You don't know what it's like to have an autistic... - ..to have a... - A son. Son. Am I supposed to take advice from someone who thinks so little of herself that she travels across the country for some guy she lets fuck God knows how many women while she's in the other room? Fuck you. May I remind you, you're out of jurisdiction here. That body is the state property of the Republic of Ireland and if you touch it, you will have a diplomatic incident on your hands. - For fuck's sake. - What? I'm... I'm sorry, sir. But what's the crime here? Look, Sheila, we can't have people disregarding the direct orders of the Gardai just... because. I have his solicitor telling me he's acting irrationally because of grief. Yes! - If we all did that, where would we be? - In a better place. - Detective! - Ah! This is my fault. Please leave them out of this. - I made a mess of getting him here. - You made an absolute hames of it. Whatever I did, whatever you think of me, promise me you'll bury Pádraig Murphy next to his brother. He belongs... He belongs where Cork City Council sees fit. Now, you do not have to say anything that may harm... Come on, he should be next to his brother. He's more than a bag of fucking peas! Sir. What? If doing something good for your fellow man is a crime... ..I don't think I have what it takes to be a Garda. Oh, for fuck's sake, Sheila! Here. Give me strength. Look at us - hiding from the world. Mary, do you think I'm a coward? God, no! No. I didn't mean... Navigating the world is hard enough when you're... normal. Whatever that means. Louis, I think you're a hero. I want to thank Daniel... ..Mary and Louis for bringing Pádraig home. And I want to thank each and every one of you for coming. At this time of year, we give a lot of things. But what you've given today is your presence. In life, Pádraig had a difficult relationship with his brother. It pained him that they were separated by more than just the Atlantic Ocean. And then, in death, Pádraig's brother Tommy... ..lay for 12 years on an island cut off from life, ..hidden from society. But now he's being buried on another island. And you need only look around you to see... Mary... was it a bad thing that I didn't go... ..to Mum's grave? No. No, because she knows just how much you loved her. You know that, Louis? - Hey. - But their legacy is this. It's you. Whatever impulse made you come here today... ..cherish it... let it grow. Because... that is love. And... that... is... life. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Take care. Hey, get in the front, will you? I don't want to look like your chauffer. - Hello? - Detective, this is Frank Delaney here. I've just come from the Attorney General's Office. Lawyers' tea party, was it? I've a proposal they're happy with if you are. He just donates to a charity, and that's it? Thought you'd be happy. So does that mean they're free to fly? Yeah, I suppose. Thanks. - Careful using the mixer next time. - Yeah. No metal objects. Hey, Carla, yes. Uh... I'm so sorry. Just please tell Ger that I'm on it, OK? Louis, I need you to come home with me tomorrow, OK? I am home. - Hey, Louis... - Daniel, fuck off! What about our deal, huh? Fuck. Thank you, Frank, for everything. I don't know what your mum would've made of it all. I think she'd have been aiding and abetting. God, what I wouldn't have done to have met your mum when I was your age. Not sure what my dad would've thought. Ah, no. - I wasn't thinking. No, I mean... - Frank. Louis told me that Mum was trying to book tickets to come and visit me in New York. Yeah, she wanted to talk to you about... Louis... and... with Louis... and the three of you about... ..you know. I could've done with a little bit of a heads up there. That he knew. That you knew. Look, Daniel, uh... I'm in uncharted territory here and uh... and it doesn't make what I'm going to say next any easier, but... - Louis doesn't want to go to New York. - Can we talk about this tomorrow? I've got so much stuff to pack. All this... He's asked me to speak to you on his behalf. He wants to be free to make his own decisions, make his own choices without you. Was that his decision or your suggestion? For feck's sake, I don't want to be interfering but... So what, he's saying that he... he what? Look, as a solution, I can move in here with him and help him with his maths. I've grown very fond of him. And he trusts me. And I think your mum would've been OK with that. It's a solution. Hm? He may not get his maths this year, but he'll get them next year. Then we can reassess and we can talk then. I can get him into a day school. And, you know, fuck math. He can just do a photography course. There are a ton of those in Manhattan. He can do whatever he wants. - But he just needs... - Daniel! This is where he should be. He's not going. I'm sorry. - I shouldn't have said what I said. - Yeah. Um... You know, I um... I have to pay a fine to a charity and I couldn't find the one that's right. So I'm setting one up for people without next of kin - for the next Pádraig - and I was wondering if you'd be interested in... You know, you could run it. - It was just an idea. - It's a nice idea. You could call it Save The Stiff. I was also thinking that maybe... Louis can help you with it? Yeah. Louis is staying here. With Frank. It's what Louis wants. It's... It's what's best for him. And I should've... I should've seen that earlier. But I'll be back soon. Maybe we can just... ..get a cup of coffee, or... just grab a drink. You know, go out for dinner. I think we should just leave things here. Thanks for this. You know when you asked me what I was sorry about? I wasn't fully honest. What I'm mostly sorry about, Louis, is that I never thanked Mum and Dad for keeping you in my life. So I'm not gonna let you negotiate yourself out of it, OK? Louis, I want to... I want to be here... to tell you that thing that makes you go to school when you don't want to go. Will you let me? No, the other one! - The happy one! - This was her favourite. Fucking 83 and she drives that like she stole it. Mary, you're going too fast. But I'm doing... I'm doing all right besides that, aren't I? - Hi, Mary. - It's pretty appropriate. You're a brave woman, Eileen. Yeah, well, you're in no position to be making a joke at my expense. Sorry. If you're looking to practise, maybe you can drop us home? I don't want a lift from you, Mary. I'll walk home. - OK. - I'll take a lift. I'm feeling brave. You'd want to be feeling brave wearing that thing. - Oh, my God, is this our old PE kit? - Yep. How does it still even fit you? - It doesn't. The arms are too tight. - It fits me, all right? It's short on his legs. You need a new tracksuit, Daniel. You guys don't know what you're talking about. It fits fine! - Stretch your arms out. - Like this? - Can you do this? - Yeah, I can do this. Yeah, but can you raise them up high? This is an outrage! It fucking fits! Right, Louis? Right?
