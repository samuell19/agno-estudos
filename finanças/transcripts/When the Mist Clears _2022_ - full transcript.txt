(upbeat music) (upbeat energetic music) - I enjoyed our last session. It really felt like a huge step forwards. It's really helps to know more about your past relationships. Did you manage to make time to speak to your father? Isabella, in your last session, we ended on a dream you keep having. I'd like to go back through my notes and explore the dream further with you. You mention it's always on a boat and you have a relationship with a man. He's older, clever, rich, handsome, unpredictable but violent. You stayed with him even it hurt you and it's not safe. Is there a part of you that likes the treatment, the attention. Are you always naked in the dream. (gentle piano music) Were there happy moments? (upbeat rock music) (upbeat rock music) (Isabella screams) What about sex? When was better during bad moments or during good ones? - I have a question for you. - Yes - [Isabella] How often do you think of me naked? - Never, I... - Do I make you feel nervous? Come closer. That was a really great session. I feel so much clearer now. See you next week. (door opens) (door closes) (clock ticking) (phone rings) (Frank speaks in foreign language) - Martin, hello. Yes. What? You canceled her appointments. What, all of them? Martin, I have paid you for three months in advance. There aren't any other therapist, you were the last. What do you mean? She did what! That's it. I've had it up to here with with that girl, I've had enough. - Frank. - I'm finished with her. - What happened? - That was martin on the phone, he just told me that she tried to seduce him in the consulting rooms. - Frank, sit down, come on. - It's unbelievable. - Frank. - I'm at my wits end with that girl. Everything I do, she tries to humiliate me. After everything I have done for that child, the best school, the best education. I buy her a car. - I know. - I give her the best clothes. - I know Frank. But we have to do something. Maybe we need to try a different approach with her. What about we go to that place we talked about in the countryside. Monte Berico Estate. - No. - Why don't we go there? - No. - The three of us, it's gonna be a family retreat. It's gonna be fun. - We will kill each other. - Please. Listen, we will not kill each other because I'm gonna be there. We can rent the place for us and you can spend some time with her, try to talk to Isabella. Come on, say yes. - Don't you think I have tried? - Please. - She can't stand being in the same room as me. - Well, she will be forced to be in the same room. You have to make an effort too. - Well, it's not me that you gonna have to convince easily. - Well, we can start with you. It's gonna be good, I promise. - That's cheating. You don't look at me with those big brown eyes. - Well, it's a yes, right? We are gonna have a lot of fun, it's gonna be beautiful. I'm gonna wear beautiful dresses. It's gonna be amazing, I promise. Isabella, how was your day? - Isabella, I want to have a word with you. - [Claudia] Frank. - I took a telephone call from your therapist this afternoon, Martin. He told me what you were trying to do in his consulting room of all places. Don't you realize how inappropriate this behavior is? This is another therapist that we've lost. - [Isabella] The reason I don't like that therapist is because he tried to fuck me. - What! - Yes, he touched me. - Frank. - I've heard all this before. Don't you think I've heard all this before. Well, Claudia and I have made a decision. We are going away for few weeks just the three of us and we are going to try and reconnect. - I'm not going anywhere. - Isabella. - Isabella, don't you turn your back on me. It will be the last thing you will do in this house, I swear. You will go to your room and you will pack your bags and you will leave this house or you are coming with us tomorrow. Do you understand, I'll stop your allowance, I'll take your car off you? - [Isabella] Fine. - Well, that went well. (lively music) (lively music) (lively music) (insects chirping) (lively music) (upbeat gentle music) (Vivian speaks in foreign language) - Welcome! Welcome to Monte Berico Estate. - Vivian? - I'm Vivian. Nice to finally meet you. - And this is my husband. - Hello. - Hi, Vivian. - Hello, Vivian, I'm Frank. - And this is Isabella. - Isabella. Let me show you around, Fabio is gonna take care of your luggage. - [Claudia] Fantastic. - There's so much to see. Would you like a short or a long tour? - [Isabella] Short. - A long one I think would be amazing. - Everything you see on this estate we gonna bring in our kitchen. Everything you eat is fresh made here. (bright music) And this is our main pool. You can sunbath all day long and we will bring you some fresh drinks for the garden. So as I said, we have golden fish there. And after you practice some yoga with us in the mornings, you could also come in the kitchen and help us around. - [Claudia] Fantastic. I would love that. - Yes, our guest can join us in all areas. (bright music) Come, come, come, this is a nice surprise for Isabella, because that's where you're gonna stay all by yourself. - [Isabella] Well, enjoy the tour. - [Vivian] If you guys wanted to see some fresh fruits? - Yes, yes, carry on with the tour. - [Vivian] The chicken. We could collect some fruits and pears. - [Claudia] Absolutely we can. (gentle morose music) - He wants nine you give him six. (gentle morose music) I have to go. (gentle morose music) - [Fabio] Hey, Matt. - Hey, Fabio. - Hi, you ready to work? - Sure. - A lot to do. - As always - Okay, first thing, the lower field, cut all that grass again. - Okay. - Orchards, lemons, apples, collect those up. - All right. - Okay, I trust you. One family for the whole month today. - Yeah, a whole month. Do you honestly think they will stay for the whole month? - You never know. - I was just thinking about the family that was here before them. They say that they were going to stay for a month but they left after two weeks. (Fabio chuckles) Don't get me wrong, what I think is just that they might like the idea of being here. They want to come here because they want to disconnect from the city, they want to get in touch with nature. But as soon as they experience how life is here, all the insects, all the smell, all the hard work, they just get bored and tired, and they go home. - Yeah, it's tough. Give 'em a chance, all right. - Okay. - Keep an eye on them, especially the daughter. - She's pretty, isn't she? - Okay, get to work. Get out of here. She's pretty.

We are miles away from everything. - Look, I need to call my friends, okay. - Yeah, you are not gonna be able to call your friends for a while.

Okay, well you look better in dresses than me, so I better let you win. - I like this one. (both chuckles) - Get some sleep. - Yeah. - So, are there really snakes here? - Oh yeah, Especially at night. I see you didn't take my advice about shoes. We had a long day, followed by an early morning. Have a good night. Watch your step. (lively music) (birds chirping) (upbeat rock music) (man sings song in foreign language) (somber music) - Are you sure you won't come with us, Isabella? Claudia, come on let's go. - Frank, just wait for me in the car, will take one minute. It's beautiful. Isabella, I know how is it when you miss somebody that you love. You must miss him very much. I lost my parents when I was seven in a car accident and I lost my husband and I found your dad. He really, really cares about you. Are you sure you don't wanna come with us? Why don't you give him a chance? Listen, I know I'm not your mother but we can still be friends, right? You know I don't have to like you, I don't have to care about you, but I actually do. And I'm quiet stubborn, I'm not gonna give up on you. And you have a chance with him. You don't wanna waste too much time. This is our chance to be a family. Hey, think about it. (insects chirping) - Hey, you, can you take me to the town. - I don't drive, you could ask Matt. - You, can you take me to the town. - I can't today. - [Isabella] Why? - We have got a lot to do. You could walk. - How far is it? - About nine miles. - Are you joking right. - [Matt] Nope. - Fuck. (insects chirping) (Isabella screams) (Fabio screams) - What the fuck are you doing here? - Are you okay? I heard you screaming. What's going on. - There is a snake there. - [Matt] What's happening, what's wrong. - There is a snake there. - Okay, stand back. This is your snake. Take care of this. - Have a good night. - I'm sorry, he leaves things out. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Okay, have a good night. - I hate this place. - You really hate it? - Yeah. - Why? - It's too quiet and dangerous. - It can be quiet, it can be good, maybe you are looking at the wrong parts, 'cause there's so much to do here. Maybe you should try it out. - Try what? - Just see what's around you, experience it a little bit. - I think I can handle it. - You do? - Yeah, prove me. - Okay, you think you could last a proper days work. - Yeah. - Really, alright, I am not gonna go easy on you. - Okay. - It's gonna be early. - Where? - 5 a.m. at the barn. - 5 a.m. there, we will see. - Yeah. - Okay.

Okay. - Yes. - Parmesan. - Okay, I was gonna do that by the way. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Sit, Sit. Give me your plate. Good, so you like it. - Yes, you are a good cook. - Yeah, this is a secret ingredient right there. - Ah, may I ask you a personal thing? - Sure - Are you single? (Matt chuckles) - Yeah, I mean, I am here all of the time, so I don't really have time for a relationship. We have a lot to do as you know. How about you? - No, I am not in a relationship. - I'm kinda, my life is a bit like a river. - A river? - Yeah, I just go with the flow and I don't know where it's gonna take me... - Hmm. - Yeah. (Matt chuckles) Well, I have to work again tomorrow. Thank you for joining me. - Thank you. - I am glad you liked it. I really am. - I'll send Fabian to do the dishes. - Are you sure you wanna go? - I should go. All right, thank you though. If you wanna grow a little more, 5 o'clock tomorrow? (Matt laughs) (insects chirping) (chicken crowing) - Hello. - Hey, good morning. - Ready for work. - Yeah, of course. - You're funny. - Why?

(insects chirping) - Can you cook? - Yes, I can. - Come with me. - So how do you like your salad? - Small pieces. - Right, like this? - Yeah, smaller. - Okay. So tell me, how was your day here? - It was hard, I was with Matt. Yeah. - Yeah, I'm glad you had fun. - May I ask you something? - Go ahead. - Are Matt and Vivian together? - No, no, they are just really good friends, they met when they were kids and now they are just like brothers and sisters. Just really good friends. - How did you end up working here? - This is a funny story, I was leading another kind of life, I was part of a circus. It was pretty amazing. We're on tour, we performed right here on these fields. And we did a couple of shows, everything went great. I was a trapeze artist and let me say that I was pretty good it, and I used to perform without a hat. And one night, I made mistake and so I fell. I broke my back and I broke my arm. Yeah, it took me a little bit to get back on my feet. But in that moment, Matt came and he just offered me a second chance. He offered me a job, he offered me the possibility to live here. - I am so sorry to hear that you had to go through that. - It doesn't matter, I mean sometimes life can be tricky but I think that you have to take what comes. - Sorry, I have to go to get ready now. - Yeah, sure. You're the guest. - Well, thank you for inviting me. We should cheers. - Cheers. So you cook pretty well. - Yeah, I didn't cook. - I know, you have helped. I saw him, Fabio is a good guy. - Yeah, he is really a good guy. - Hmm. - I was talking with him, I thought you were engaged with Vivian. - Engaged? - Like in love. (Matt laughs) - No, I've known Vivian forever. - Oh. - Yeah. She used to live with my family when we were younger. We were really good friends. Everyone here's really good people and I try to surround myself with really good people. - Yeah, everyone is really friendly here. - Yeah, they are nice. - So you're free, you're single. - Yeah, I guess you could say that. - I had a really, really good time. - Yeah, me too. - Thank you for making food with help. So I should go, I have to work in the morning. - You have to go? - Yeah, I should go, but thank you. - Okay. - Okay. See you. - Good night. (door closes) (birds chirping) - Hey, how was the wedding? - Was that Isabella? - Yeah. - Wow. - She is happy. - We should go away more often. (Claudia laughs) (insects chirping) - So you live with your parents at home? - Oh, they are not my real parents. Yeah I figured, Frank is your stepdad, right? He is British. - Actually, Claudia, she is my stepmother, Frank is my biological father. Of course, yeah. he's British. - But you're so Italian. - Yeah, I grew up with my mom and then she died of cancer when I was 13. From there, my father works a lot so I was always with my babysitter. From one babysitter to another one and then to psychotherapists. Yeah, it was really hard for me. - That sounds pretty tough. You like it here? - Yeah. - Yeah. - My mom would love this place. - Yeah, I like having you here. - Now I do. (both chuckles) (birds chirping) (people chatting) (gentle music) (Claudia speaks in foreign language) (bell rings) (gentle music) (Frank laughs) (gentle music) (Claudia laughs) (Isabella and Claudia scream) - I wanted to show. - This seems like a magic place. - These are all olive trees. - I love these leaves. - They say if you up root a tree and move it somewhere then it doesn't bare as good fruit. - Wow. - These tress like me have been here for a while. Actually, I can't stand olives. - What? - They are horrible. - Really? So, why are we here? - 'Cause everyone else loves them. - Hey, Isabella. - Hello. - How are you? - Yeah, we are great. We at pool. You're going? - Beautiful. Yes, it's hot... - Isabella, we were thinking maybe we would leave a bit earlier. - Yes, like tonight. - When it's a bit cooler? - Oh, because I was actually planning with Vivian to make dinner for you. - Dinner? - Yeah. - Who is cooking? - [Isabella] Me. - You mean, you are going to cook for us... - Yeah. - She is cooking. - That sounds fantastic. Fabulous, yeah, let's do that. Look forward to that. That's fantastic. - Bye.

I'm impressed. - Why not. - [Claudia] And then meditate and work it out... (glass clinks) - Today, I was working with Matt, I help him doing some stuff, we feed the chicken, we picked some fruits, also zucchini from his garden. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, that's all. - So that's a nice thing. - May I ask you a question, how did you two meet? - We met actually in my office it was a business meeting. - Oh, your office, she needed a lawyer? - Yeah, my husband just passed away and your father helped me with the probate. You know the will, taking care of a lot of things. - Complicated. - We know he is really great in doing his job. But why did you choose him like a husband? - Careful what you say. - Let me think. Should I be sincere? - Yes, I think you should. - Well, because he was very different from all the other men I met before. - I had webbed feet. - Come on, he was different from any other men I had met before and he made me feel safe. (cloud lightning) (suspenseful music) - I see something is missing on this table. How about some more wine. - Hey, you give me your earrings. - [Vivian] Who are you? - Fuck you! Shut up! You, empty your pocket and you give me your necklace now. - [Claudia] Isabella. Is this a joke? - No, come on. Quickly. - [Matt] Gentlemen! - [Gypsy 1] Who the fuck are you? - You're trespassing, you need to leave right now. - [Gypsy 2] Tough American guy, you see. Come on big boy, come on. - [Matt] Stay calm. Isabella, you okay? Nobody needs to get hurt. Fabio, make sure they're okay. - [Gypsy 1] Okay. Okay. - [Matt] Shut up and walk. - [Gypsy 1] Okay. Okay. - [Claudia] Isabella, you okay. - Is everybody okay. - [Frank] No, we are not okay. What the hell was that about? - Listen, I'm sorry about that. It's just the country. - What do you mean! Frank. - Are you gonna call the policy? - Mr. Davenport, we don't call the police? - [Claudia] What do you mean you don't call the police... - They don't respect the police. We hit the nail on the head and show them they can't mess with us and we are safe, you're safe. - [Isabella] Are you okay? - Yeah. You okay? - Let's celebrate. Let's just dance it off. More wine for everyone and we celebrate. - More wine will be good. - Are you okay, Isabella? - Yeah. (everyone cheering) (everyone singing in foreign language) - Come on. (everyone singing in foreign language) - Frank, where are you going? No, no no, this way, come, it's this way. - Fabio, again old friend. Okay, come. - [Fabio] Where do we go? - We go to bed. You are getting heavy. Okay. (Matt laughs) - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - Are you drunk? - Wine, wine. (glass clinks) (Isabella chuckles) - Are you drunk? - Teeny weeny bit. Good dancing. Good dancing. - Yeah. How do you know Matt? - Matt, my brother. I lived in England. I always dream to live in London and I went as a student exchange. And his mum was like if you like it so much why don't you stay. Just stay. I stayed. Matt is like my best friend. You should have seen him as a baby. He'd stay in his room all day long on his computer. So boring. - So boring? - Yeah, I told him what do you wanna become as an adult, what's your dream? He says, "I wanna buy one bedroom apartment, stay here with a big TV and all day play games." That was he's biggest dream. And then he goes to America, build a software company from scratch and sell it for millions. This is a guy who had a small dreams and achieved so much. Then he buys this estate, then he buys buildings, he's so adventurous. He's not a boring guy anymore. He build that building and planted those lemon trees. He owns this entire property, a couple of properties in the town. - What do you mean? Matt owned all of this place? - Just I think I had a little too much to drink. I think I have to go to bed. (Vivian speaks in foreign language) (bright music) (insects chirping) (door knocks) - Isabella. - Come in. - Hey. - Hey. - You okay? - Yes, come here. - What's up. (Matt chuckles) What? Are you okay? - Why don't you tell me that you own all this place? - Vivian. - Yeah. - It's kind of complicated I guess. I mean It's not a secret. I just don't like how people treat you when they think you are important or wealthy or you have land. They look at you differently. So, I'm just doing what makes me happy. And right now I feel happy just working on the land and enjoying it and not dealing with the bullshit, fake people and I want something real. So, tell me, what's really important, - I think having someone who cares about you is really important. Like someone who asks you every day how are you and he really cares about you. Sometimes I think maybe this person loves me, maybe this person not but when you feel it, it's different. - Yeah. - You don't have to think maybe you just have to feel it 'cause in that way its real if you feel it. - Yeah. (insects chirping) - [Frank] Hi, Isabella. - Hi. - Isabella, how are you? - Fine. You? - Yeah, we are great. We're gonna have some drinks in about half an hour. Why don't you come and join us. - Yes, of course. - Yeah, I'm gonna go fix the drinks, why don't you have that chat. - Let's take a walk. - Are you okay? - There is something have been meaning to tell you for a long time but never seemed to be the right time and it was about us, about family, about your mother and it goes back to long, long way. We were so looking forward to you coming, your arrival, you know, but the delivery, well, she was in a lot of pain. I think deep down, I think she blamed me and for a little while afterwards she was depressed and I never noticed, I was so engaged in my work, I didn't see it coming. When you were three years old she had an affair. I found out by accident, and as you do with these things. And I had a big decision to make and I didn't know what to do. I came home and there was you. (speaks in foreign language) So, I made the decision, that I would wait, that this affair would fizzle out and in time she would come back to me so I waited. I waited for her to come back to me. And then when you were just starting boarding school, she fell ill, she was taken into hospital with renal failure and they diagnosed cancer. They gave her a lot of test and then gave her back to me in a wheel chair and some tubes in her back. And they said you can take her home which I did and I remember taking you school and coming back to look after your mother and I nursed her as well as I could. And when she was resting, I went to the computer and learnt a whole new language. (speaks in foreign language) I watched her as she wasted away. And there was a time when I knew I was loosing her and I looked into her eyes and said "Do you wanna live." And she very weakly said, "Yeah." So I looked into her eyes harder and I said "Do you want to live?" and she said, "Yeah." So I said, "If you eat, you live, simple." I was just looking for a little victory, anything. We tried but she couldn't keep anything down. What we found was ginger worked. And she managed to eat simple food and it was like a miracle, I couldn't believe it. Six weeks later she was walking about. It's fantastic. Christmas came, you came home from school and it was wonderful and you went back. And then about two-three weeks afterwards, she collapsed and she was rushed into a hospital and she was bleeding and we couldn't stop it and we both knew this was the end. And she wanted to confess to me. She wanted to tell me about her affair and I said, "I knew." Then she said something, she told me that she had fallen in love, and I knew she was never coming back to me in that moments. All those years I'd waited. And then I watched the light go out of her eyes and in that moment, you lost both two parents. I'm so sorry. So sorry. A few years went by and I don't even remember them, I'm in the office and this woman comes in, looking for some advice, she lost her husband and she was like a force of nature. I helped her with some probate problems. She seemed to be everywhere all at once and she rescued me. Claudia.
