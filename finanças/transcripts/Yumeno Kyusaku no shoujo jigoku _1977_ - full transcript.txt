Directed by Masaru Konuma Kyusaku Yumeno's GIRL HELL I am extremely honored to have you, Mr. School Inspector. Of course, it's my daughter's school. She is my humble daughter. May I have you attend the graduation ceremony? She is the school representative. She has become a proper young lady. I have devoted my whole life to achieving my own goals in education and... Are you saying that you remained single your whole life to work for the school every day and night? I think I can attend the graduation ceremony. I understand. Do you understand the mood of the poem Early Morning by Robert Browning? Alright. Please read it with the correct rhyme and accent. Yes. I have anpans. Would anyone like to taste an anpan? Today, we are going to do broad jumps. Yes. Hey! Amakawa! Is Ms. Mars still over there? Ms. Mars She looks funny. She has no talent, except for eating and running. I would say that her race is different from ours. She's a Martian. It's the perfect nickname for her. I can clearly see her grotesqueness. Mister! Article 26 of the School Rules: Except for special circumstances, students shall not eat in school. I think she was very hungry. She needed it because she is an athlete. In that case, why didn't she eat out in the open? She was eating secretly in the dressing room. Initially, I thought it was a big rat. Also, it was Ms. Mars. She is already strange in many ways. But that kind of punishment istooharsh! Please listen, Ms. Tonomiya. Our school only accepts students with exceptional family backgrounds. Everyone here will become a wife of the upper class in the future. I will never allow that kind of behavior! I saw Ms. Amakawa walk toward the former Etiquette Class room. Really? I knew it. What do you mean? Well... Why don't you ask Ms. Mars? I didn't know this place would look like this. Ms. Torako is too harsh. She tortures you too much. I am fine. If I were you, I wouldn't accept it! It's quiet. I can smell the mold. I like this place. When I do this, I can see the clouds floating above. You don't have to hesitate. Hey! My wife and daughter. That's all. But... Hey! Make some noise! Your moaning will be covered by my daughter playing the piano. She always keeps the sound as low as possible to not disturb her mother. Mother, it's time to take your medicine. I guess father has a guest today. Go back to your room. Why? Stop torturing me. What are you doing? Ms. Tonomiya! I never expected a good lady like you to behave like this. What if you get a bad reputation from this? What if your parents hear about this? They will feel very sad. Do you get it? A good lady like you... What? What are you hiding? What is that? Show me! Show me! What is this? Are you really playing with a childish toy like this? What is this damn thing? What is this damn thing? She has been taking a bath for a long time. When is she going to come out? Utae will get married after graduation. We can't think about her younger sisters until she gets married. You are right. As long as a guy can accept her as his wife, I am fine with anyone. I hope there is a guy who can seduce her but it's not really that easy. I have to say that's a very unfortunate thing to say. It's not that I care less about her because I am not her biological mother. Do you have anyone at the forest service? Someone who has much curiosity? Mr. Principal! That must have been an extensive workout. I will walk you home. I like working out. That's excellent. You like sports because you have a pure heart. Please eat something warm. Thank you very much. Everybody is equal before God. You can use this umbrella until you get home. That's fine. I can make a run for it. Only guys look good when they are wet. Alright! It's unfortunate that you can't see your daughter attending the ceremony. Apparently, she is the school representative. That's an exceptional achievement as a daughter of the Tonomiya family. But... Whose blood is that? Huh?! I already know she is not my daughter! Whose blood is in her? You always keep silent about that! Please forgive me! No! I won't forgive you. Forgive... No! Who is Aiko's father? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. It only means that my entertainment will last longer. You have such an innocent face and such a great body. Nothing has changed since you were a girl. When the principal recommended you as my wife, I accepted without hesitation. Mr. Principal! Mr. Principal! Thank you for coming. Thank you very much for coming. I've been waiting for you to come. I'm ugly, aren't I? I've become like an animal while waiting. Sympathize with me. I'm an ugly old man. I can't live my life without you anymore! I want to calm my dirty self every night! I torment myself and feel lonely every night. I don't have a family and stay in this cold room forever. Listen, we both know what real loneliness is. Hey! You're pathetic. It's not that I am jealous. Please don't get close to the principal! He is a scary person. It's not a secret anymore... What the principal did to you last night has been done to others too. That's a lie! "Please sympathize with a single, lonely guy like me." He is scary, isn't he? He also does various things with the parents of students who don't perform well in tests. That's not all. Aiko Tonomiya, your close friend, is actually the principal's biological daughter. - Miss! - I am being serious! I've figured it out from spending time with her every day. First of all, Tomeko Maesaka... her mother and the wife of the Tonomiya family, was pregnant when she graduated. I supervised the student dorm at that time. It's scary, isn't it? Mendel's laws. I knew it. It's about me. The principal seems to have other dirty secrets too. My father accidently told me once. Don't get too depressed. No! No! You did it with this! This is the problem! Amen. Ms. Tonomiya. I am impressed by your piety. Let's pray together. Mr. Principal! Please fuck me! What... What are you talking about? Please do to me what you have done to Ms. Amakawa! You are in front of God! Fuck me! Go away! Go away! Do you hate fucking girls? Go away! Fuck me! You are insane! No! Alright! Hurry! What happened? Forgive me. You are one dirty-minded principal. But you can't sleep with your own daughter, can you? Ms. Tonomiya. - You are working hard. - Yes. Why are you here today? - Show me. - No. It's a deal. But why do you... What kind of dirty secrets are there? Alright! I already know. Do you want to be considered a conspirator? The principal! He is the only culprit! And Ms. Torako... What? Well... Actually... He embezzled the money for the pianos. And he received money under the table from the outsourcing company for the gym construction. That can't be all. The donated money for the construction of the statue and... And? You animal! I have wanted to have a girl from the upper class like you for a long time... Listen! Just one night. Don't forget that you are the school secretary, alright? - Good morning! - Good morning! Tama! Tama! Good morning! Let me pretty you up, Tama! Come in. Good morning. What's up? They will place it in the garden to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the school. I am pregnant with your baby. A baby? What are you talking about, Ms. Amakawa? I am old. Only God knows. It's your baby! And I want to have it! Listen! Calm down. The suffering of my students is also my suffering. Maybe it's in your imagination, since you are still young. Let's check one more time. Leave it to me. When the darkness comes at night... My suffering grows more intense... What a healthy body. I've done this so many times. You need to control yourself. That's all. Just think about something positive. Don't move! I can't remove it properly! Remove it? Mr. Principal! Principal! Please hold her for me! Calm down! Hey! Hey! Get on with it! Hey! What's wrong? What happened to the baby in your womb? Decide! Remove it! That's the principal's baby! It'd be my biological sibling! We would have the same blood! Don't give birth to the baby! Don't give birth to the baby! Don't give birth to the baby! Don't give birth to the baby! D o n 't! Thank you. Thank you. I think God will forgive me for drinking the devil's water today. You are my children. I love you with all my heart. As you already know, I don't have children of my own. In order to devote myself to education, I have remained unmarried. Over the past 5 years, your names, faces and appearances have been engraved upon my heart. You have become proper, flawless young ladies. I have to send you away to a disgraceful world full of evil. That's the meaning of this day. You are looking good. Did you hear from your father? I have a good husband candidate for you. He is a young reporter from a Tokyo newspaper who likes sports. If you accept him, your happy future will be guaranteed. My happy future? That's right. Please go to the bigger world in Tokyo and start a new life there. Please accept him. As long as I keep it secret, you can become a good wife. Do you understand? Mr. Principal! Stop making that gloomy face. The sake will go bad! Come on! Help me stand up. Hey! You look very down today. Please look this way! I am taking the picture! 1 - 2 - 3! That was great! Thank you! Strange Fire at a Prestigious School Former Etiquette Classroom Was Completely Burned An Unidentified Burned Body was Found in the Debris Arson with Intention to Murder Is Suspected No! Please! The principal does not wish to talk with outsiders about the unfortunate incident. You found a burned body in the debris. You haven't released any statement yet! Even if it is a warehouse now, it used to be an Etiquette Classroom! Please! Please go back! Please don't ruin the principal's mood! No! We don't want a statement from the secretary! Fetch the principal! Please go back! Please! How unfortunate, Mr. Principal. That's mean, Mr. Principal! Did you send the reporters away? Yes, but it was not easy. They were very tenacious. We can't have them meet the principal! He is supposed to take a break now! How unfortunate. You were once the best principal in the prefecture. Who is the fucking arsonist? Mr. Principal, a letter for you. Yes! - Here. - Thank you. This is a letter from Utae Amakawa. Ms. Mars? It's scary. This is the end of everything. Ms. Mars! The burned body must be Ms. Mars' body! Mr. Principal! I think my body will have been burned beyond recognition. Do you understand the meaning of the burned body? I am extremely happy at the moment. This is my revenge against you. Who saw it first? This isn't easy. This is a scandal! The combination of a holy priest and a dirty geisha... No story is stranger than this! Somebody has tried to set me up for a crime. I see... But, also, a strange letter has been delivered to us. It contains information about many of your wrongdoings. I am very interested. It's a set-up! I've devoted my whole life to education. "Where there is smoke there is fire." The Etiquette Classroom has been burned! Excuse me! Well... Well... Sorry for bringing the school inspector's daughter here. Alright! We will serve you a cup of tea soon. This is such a strange incident. Actually, Miss... Were you close to Utae Amakawa? Yes. After our investigation, we've concluded that the burned body... belongs to Utae Amakawa, who has been missing. Maybe you are right. Do you have any clues? Yes. She said that the world was meaningless. She said life was meaningless. Mr. Principal was not careful enough. I've heard a rumor that the police are secretly working on the case. Will it be alright? You are responsible for the embezzlement! But initially you made me... I know nothing. You ask where hell is. We are still living in this world. The karma will come to you according to what you do here. You will board the fire wagon, rolling your eyeballs. You rotate again and again and fall in the end. After various evil worlds, you will end up in the real hell... a mountain with numerous spikes, a blood-filled lake, a cold hell and a burning hell. Please feel free. I will introduce my wife soon. You don't have to... I heard she was sick. You are our principal. It wouldn't be proper. She's been looking forward to seeing you. - Welcome. - Ms. Aiko. I have some charcoal that makes you live long. Would you like some, Mr. Principal? It's a popular drink nowadays. Please help yourself. Alright. Please make yourself comfortable. Actually, Mr. Principal... I've brought you here today... to make you resign as the head of your current school. Considering the arson that occurred in the Etiquette Classroom and the church scandal... I can't help you anymore, not even with my powers. Many letters speaking of your dirty secrets have been delivered to me. What do you think? Long time no see. Come here and drink a little. But I... Come here. A little drink might help you get better. Please pour it by yourself, Mr. Principal. Mr. Principal? I am honored. She is still the same, isn't she? Yes. She is still beautiful. She has a strange body. Nothing has changed at all. Look! Nothing has changed at all! Honey! Her boobs are the same. Excuse me. I forgot to do something. See you. Our conversation is not over yet. Or are you accepting the offer I made earlier? No, that's... Such a strange body. Stop it! Stop! What's that noise? How was it, Mr. Principal? The charcoal I handed to you earlier, the stuff that makes people crazy? Stop making stupid jokes! It was a piece of Utae Amakawa's burned brain, found in the debris. Would you like some charcoal? It's not ordinary charcoal like you can find anywhere. It's from a pyramid in Egypt. It is from a mummy that has been in the pyramid for thousands of years. Hey! Mister! Would you like some? Going away? How unfortunate. Miss! Would you buy some? I brought it here myself after crossing gigantic oceans. I am serious! I see... Mr. Principal! We have been looking for you for some time. What happened? Your face is pale. The charcoal... Mr. Principal! A messenger from Utae Amakawa asked me to deliver this to Mr. Principal. - Open it! - Yes. Utae Amakawa's Fetus A sick joke. Yes... Throw it away! Disgusting! Yes. Tama. Tama. Tama! Tama! Tama. Who is it? Who is it?! Forgive me! Please forgive me! Wasn't it Amakawa? Not Utae Amakawa? Are you possessed by Ms. Amakawa's ghost? You will be possessed by my mother this time. My mother killed herself. It's a terrible disgrace. I told people she killed herself because of the suffering from her disease. Alright? Finally, we can protect the reputation of General Tadazumi Tonomiya's... legitimate grandchild, Aishiro Tonomiya. What? My mother may be dead... But don't you forget that I'm still alive. What are you trying to say? Revenge. Revenge? On me? Yes. Are you going to avenge your mother on your father? Don't touch me! You are not my father! You are just a dirty guy to me! - Debauched and lewd. - That's right. You are right. If I am just a promiscuous guy to you... Then you are just a woman. Just a female. That's right! The young lady of the Tonomiya family is a female. Get out! I have a Buddhist monk's blood... the Principal Morisu's blood, my mother's blood... the secretary's blood and Kawamura's blood. It's dirty blood. I am the real symbol of the Tonomiya family scandal! I am sure an evil baby will be born! Insane... You are insane. And so are you! It's Mars! It's a devil! Mr. Principal. Are you... Am I no longer on Earth? Yes, this is a planet where only crazy people live. It's not just you. We are all crazy. I ate your brain. I guess that worked. But the burned body belonged to a female vagrant. She was sleeping inside. Do you mean that you are still alive? Let's separate here. I hope you live long, Mr. Principal. Please also live the life we were supposed to live. Good-bye! As long as you live... Good-bye, Mr. Principal! Good-bye, everyone on Earth! THE END
