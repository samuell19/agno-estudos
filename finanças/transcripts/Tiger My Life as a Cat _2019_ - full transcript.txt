Walking With Cats Bakumatsu Battle Super Entertainment! Please, Ryoma-sama! Volume 46 now on sale! Excuse me. I'm looking for this book. It's over there. Thank you. Not again! Catman Hey! It's Catman time! Catman! Catman By Takahata Suzuo "My dad is a successful manga artist." "He's busy with a manga series" "and rushing to meet deadlines everyday." "That's why he can't be here today." "I'm grateful to him for working so hard" "for my mum and me." One more! Come on, number seven! Come on! "His masterpiece is called Catman." "It's the story of a family and a tabby cat." "By the way, the girl in the story" "is called Miyu, just like me." Wow! That's so cool! "The hero, Catman, is super cute." "My dad loves him" "as if he were a member of our family." "I'm so proud of my dad." You're such a liar! Your dad isn't drawing manga. Kento, sit down. Catman was so unpopular it was cancelled five years ago without even a proper ending. He's currently resting due to poor health. I found all that out on my dad's smartphone. —Kento! —Poor health? That's a lie! I always see him wandering around. Yeah! With his hair looking like a bird's nest! Your dad is no manga artist. He's just a weirdo! Right? Weirdo... weirdo! Weirdo... weirdo! Be quiet! Weirdo... weirdo! Weirdo... weirdo! It sure is lively in here. The weirdo's here! Stop... he heard us! Hi, I'm the weirdo! I can't believe you admitted to it! I told you not to come! What are you saying? I was on a roll but I chose to come here instead. Yo, Teacher! Hi. Get out. Right now. Are you sure you want to talk to me like that? Excuse me. By Takahata Miyu Oh, I wonder who drew this picture? See? I knew it! It's the work of a genius manga artist whose work sold 1.27 million copies. Yours truly, Takahata Suzuo! Miyu cheated! Stop it! Cheater... cheater! —Stop it! —Cheater! Cheater... cheater! —Cheater... —Cheater! Hey Miyu. How long are you going to stay mad at me? Fine, I'll do whatever you say. Don't forget you said that. What? You're so cute! Hey, you know that I... You hate cats. I can't stand them! I'm sorry this house is so small, kitty. We aren't keeping it. You said you'd do whatever I say. I don't remember saying that. Lazing around again? So is the cat. Cats are allowed to because they're cute. That's not fair. Cats are the worst. All they do is laze around get free food and then leave. They contribute nothing to society. Sounds like someone I know. He says that but he draws a cat manga series. That's just for business. Business. So get on with it. You just need one more chapter to complete Volume 11. Then you'll get paid, right? I've already told you that Catman is dead. You haven't drawn that. Listen, Miyu. Cats have the habit of sneaking away without telling anyone. That is the only thing I like about them. Are we moving to a castle like you promised? That's sorted. We have good news coming our way soon. We'll have yakisoba every night in the castle! Yahoo! I can't stand you. Miyu... I love mew! No! Don't! Stop it! Kitty! It's running away. Darn it! You're the worst. You're definitely going to hell. Hold it. Don't move. I captured your angry face. I can draw much better! Better than a professional? I'm home! I got leftover taiyaki for free again. —Natsuko, look. —Mum, look. Miyu, you didn't have to draw every laugh line, you know. I'm going to be a professional. I'll earn more than Dad and buy you a huge house. —I'll live there too. —You get the kennel. It's all right. I'm earning quite a bit myself. Thank you, Natsuko. I really love mew. Suzuo, stop biting me. Well, I'm a cat. She's my mum. Get off her. Tiger: My Life As A Cat —The competition's cancelled? —Yeah. We would've had a spot open for a new series but Uragami-sensei said, "I'll do it." Uragami Eigo strikes again. He has so much work, but he wants more. Well, he is really... The author of "Please, Ryoma-sama" Uragami Eigo. ... talented. It's Uragami-sensei. What TV show is this? He plays harpsichord like Mozart. A second Mozart! Up next, we'll find out more about this charming artist. You both debuted at the same time didn't you, Mr Takahata? Well, yeah. Hey, call me "sensei" too. But you have your own distinctive style. Right? So, what do you think? You might say "not again" again, but... Not again. Everyone's waiting for Catman. Just one more chapter. 32 pages. —Even 24 pages would do. —Listen. I sick of hearing about Catman all the time. I only did that series because I knew it'd sell. I hate cats but I get spammed with cat videos from cat lovers. I can't stand it. The publishing industry is in crisis. In order to survive... That's why I came up with this. Not just a family story. They go back to the Bakumatsu period and meet Commodore Perry. Due to this encounter... That sounds kind of familiar. Please, Ryoma-sama No, it's... I mean... It's about Perry and a family. Give me a chance to succeed. You know, it's all about marketing... —Do Catman. —I don't want to! So, produce a masterpiece that will surpass Catman. Fine, I will. It'll be a real masterpiece. But I'll never give it to you. That was amazing! I'm home. You'll catch a cold sleeping out here. A masterpiece? I'm all out of ideas. God, please help me. I am the God of Manga. No inspiration. It's freezing. Robot Perry 3 February, Saturday Suzuo? Sorry, you must be hungry. I'm fine. Go back to sleep. I don't feel well. You're working too hard. Take a day off work. I need the toilet. Really? Ouch. I see a thief. I'm calling the police. Wait. You'll get a cut when I win ten times as much. Yeah, as if that would happen. Today could be our lucky day. You are coming back, aren't you? We didn't have a demon last year. Trust me, you'll be attacked by the mightiest demon yet. Stop it. I love mew. I told you to stop it. Idiot! I wish you were dead! That's it. Go! Go... go! Takata! Go! That's it... Come on... Takata... Takata! That's it... Takata! Go... go! I did it! 97,000 yen. Lady Luck is smiling on me at last. Miyu, Suzuo is pretty late, isn't he? I bet he lost and he can't face us. I bet he won big and we'll have sukiyaki tomorrow. He's only good at two things. Drawing and gambling. Mum, I've asked you this like a thousand times but why did you choose him? I don't know. I'd prefer someone successful like the author of One Piece. Mum? Suzuo... is dead. Takahata Suzuo? How did you know my name? Before proceeding to your next life the dead must pass through this checkpoint. We interview each and every soul to decide their destination. You're going too fast. We're pressed for time today. We're always extra busy on windy days. What are you talking about? You're dead. —What? —Moving on, you... Stop right there! Please stay in the dock. The dock, please. —Go back. —So, you're a big shot? You're a big shot, right? You will be judged according to your achievements in this lifetime. No. I'm not dead. I'm alive. Look. I can move. You prefer to go back to your current life? —Of course. —Why is that? Well... I've been really lucky at gambling this month. There's a big race coming up... So the report I have on you is accurate. You spent your wife's earnings on pachinko and your daughter's savings on bicycle races. —That's not... —But gambling isn't the biggest issue with you. —You clung on to petty past glories. —Petty? You were too lazy to work hard and hoped for an easy comeback. —You know me well. —Now for your sentence. —Wait... —You've shown no remorse for neglecting your family and leading a selfish life. Your punishment is to go back to that life and make amends for your stupidity. You have one month to make up for 33 years. That's too short. You will return as a cat. What? No, anything but a cat! That really hurts. Wait... am I... I'm so lucky. That was close. Bloody driver. Oh yeah. Huh? I can't grip it. I must be tired. No way. That really stinks. How can you eat that? Cute kitty. You're new here. You don't have to eat it if you don't want to. You're that cat Miyu picked up. Miyu? Oh, that cute little girl. Thank you. We're actually talking! Yeah, and? I'll eat it if you won't. This sucks. Why do I have to be a cat? Hi, big boy. My, I love your coat pattern. —Coat pattern? —I know a good place. There's a cool back alley nearby. How about it? Are you in heat? I'm not interested. I only like humans. Cats? No way. Come on. My boyfriend isn't here right now. That's not the issue. You! What are you doing to my girl? No, this she-cat... I mean, your girlfriend... Let go, you pervert. You're new here. I'm not hostile. That guy knows me. You do, don't you? —He hit on her. —Hey! You punk! Get him. What... what? Stop it! Ouch... that hurts. Yummy. I love pork dumplings. Excuse me. I'd like a pizza dumpling. —A pizza dumpling... —How did you get in? —Want a pork dumpling? —Pizza dumpling! Give me a pizza dumpling! Ouch. That hurts. So, it isn't a dream. Being a cat sucks. It's not that bad. There are things only we can see. —Who are you? —How do you do? I'm Whitest. Because you're white? How unoriginal. Don't be rude. "Whitest" means the purest of white. Dad gave me that name. "Dad"? Oh, you're a pet cat. How about you? I'm a stray. I've only just become a cat. Actually, Whiteness... It's Whitest. I was human until yesterday. I see. Be a bit more surprised, will you? How do I survive as a cat? I can't stand it. I've been attacked by the other cats and went to bed hungry. In that case... find someone to look after you. Who? I'm sure there is somewhere you belong. He was my student. Oh, Teacher! Excuse me. Natsuko. Miyu. Recognise me? Get out of here, kitty. All right... I'm leaving. —I... —I lied. I really loved... Catman. I'm sorry for being so arrogant. Mr Takahata. Call me "sensei". Show some respect to the dead. Uragami Eigo. Stop trying to look good. Let me go! Darn it. —You stay out here. OK... —Why did you... OK... coochy-coo... That feels so good. You're good at that. Bye. Good evening. Hi. What's your name? —I don't have one yet. —Where do you live? Here. I've come back. I really am dead. Kitty, let's eat. Thank you! There you go. It's delicious. This is extravagant for us. Wow. You eat everything. Hey, Miyu. You're going to keep it? —Absolutely. —I'll have some ginger. Face this way. You're kind. He said "keep me". I didn't say that. But keep me. I don't want to be a stray anymore. —Give me food and shelter. —He's so cute! Mum, can we? Can we? All right. But if you don't take good care of it no more gummies for you, ever. What? All right. Right, Tiger? —Tiger? —Because it's a tabby? —Tiger? —How unoriginal. You don't mind, do you? What are you doing? It's a tom cat. I hope he doesn't make trouble. I won't. It's odd timing that he came on funeral night. —Maybe he's Dad... —No way. Why not? Well, Suzuo must be... in hell right now. You're right. Go easy on me, I'm dead. Mum, you look a bit pale. Do I? Are you all right? I'm fine. I guess I'm just a bit tired. I mean, Suzuo died so suddenly. He could've at least told us he was going to die. Tiger, we'll be together forever. Rubbing cheeks. It's been so many years. Tiger. Why won't you play? —I have my pride. —Mum. No dinner for Tiger then. What's up, Tiger? Hey! Tiger! —Yum. —Don't eat that. What... what? This way, Tiger. Cats have great sense of balance. That's amazing! —What an idiot. —Darn. I've got to be more catlike. Oh, it actually tastes good. It's delicious... How old is Miyu? She's... nine. Or is she ten? You should pay more attention to your family. Family? I'm nothing but a pet. I just make them like me to get food. You're so selfish. You have to repay them for their kindness. That's just for humans. Ready? —Go. —What's this? Slide into the box from this side. Come on... Major fail. What are we doing? Uragami Eigo, author of "Please, Ryoma-sama" has been hospitalised for exhaustion... I don't have to work. He collapsed at his desk and was rushed to hospital. Being a cat is great. —Be quiet. —Be quiet. Sorry. Perfect! Mum, I got so many likes. Natsuko, I'm on a roll! Yes! Delicious. That's odd. Thanks, Tiger. I totally forgot. Right, today is... 24th of February. Thank you. Miyu, eat your cabbage. OK. Hey, Whiteness. It's Whitest. Is the food really so good there? Of course. It's unusual for you to eat out. Everyone gets tired of cat food. Not just the food I'm tired of living as a pet. Oh, right. Being with them gets annoying. Maybe I should stay there less. You'll be punished for saying that. I don't care. I'm already dead. Here it is. Wait, isn't this... The trash is in the rear. I recommend the grilled salmon. Natsuko works here. Let me grill you a little bit. Grilled salmon. So happy. Grilled. G-R-I-L-L-E-D. Natsuko? Natsuko! Hey, Natsuko! Natsuko! Help! Please help her. Hey... what's wrong? What's up, kitty? You love fish, don't you? No. Come on. What's up? It's so strong. What an annoying cat. —Hurry! —What is it? Oh no. Mrs Takahata! —Natsuko? —Hey, Natsuko... No... you stay here. Let go. Easy... —You're OK now. —Get out of here. Natsuko... Natsuko... Open up! Miyu! Something bad happened! Miyu! Why are you yowling so loud, Tiger? Natsuko's in danger. What's wrong? She collapsed at work. And then... an ambulance came for her. —I don't know where... —I'm home. Hi, Tiger. —Hi, Miyu. —What happened, Mum? You're home early. —Come on. —Welcome home. I went to the hospital. The hospital? But why? Did you catch a cold? Ta-daa. I bought taiyaki with creamy caramel inside. You bought taiyaki? Are we celebrating something? Nice to meet you... Big Sister. You're pregnant? Well done, Natsuko! Beer, beer. Or how about that wine? —The one we got as a gift. —Tiger's excited. Of course. We've always wanted another kid. Right, Miyu? Congratulations, Mum. Thank you. You're a sister now. I'm going to cry. We'll be a family of three again. We'll have to choose a name. You pick a boy's name. I'll pick a girl's. If it's a boy, use a character from my name. "Su" meaning "celebration". I want to celebrate. Miyu, you're still awake? Is that the sequel to Catman? Dad? Now you know. Catman is actually... Boom! me, your dad! I was worried about you so I became a cat to protect you. Miyu! You're so clever. You realised who I am. We look so happy together. Tiger, shush. Sorry. So, what happens next? What's wrong, Miyu? I... don't want a baby. I don't want a baby That's sad. I see. You've always been an only child. Don't worry. Natsuko won't love you any less. Come on. Cheer up. I love mew. Stop it. Go away. Right now. The "Mi" from Miyu plus the "tsuko" of Natsuko makes "Mitsuko". Too old-fashioned. Hey, Natsuko. What's wrong, Tiger? Miyu doesn't want a baby. Go talk to her. What's with all the mewing? Don't do that. I've never seen Miyu so sad before. Go talk to her. I see. You're happy too. You're a big brother now. No. That's not it. This is so frustrating. Cats can't do anything. Make me human again, just for one day. Your Honour! What can you do in a day? Y-You heard me? We're having a baby. I need to earn money for the medical bills. I have no savings or insurance. And how do you plan to earn your money? Thank you for asking. —Tomorrow's race... —Get back. Tomorrow's race is a sure thing. I've won on that horse before. You haven't changed one bit. Enjoy the rest of your cat-life. —Who's next? —Hey... wait... It's still my turn. You're heartless. I treat all souls fairly and objectively. At least say something. We aren't strangers. I'll say three things to you. Make amends for your foolishness. You only have until tomorrow. How can a cat make amends? I'm not you, so I don't know. And what's the third thing? After tomorrow, you will die. That's all. Ouch. The way he sends me back is way too rough. Hey, Whiteness. It's Whitest. You look sad. Dad has fallen ill. He was so healthy until recently. He's really suffering. But I can't do anything to help. I see. I'm useless. I ought to repay his kindness. Don't be sad. Just be with him. You can do that. You're a cat. Just sayin'. Thanks, Tiger. Miyu. I hope it's a girl. If it's a boy, I'll have to buy dolls for Boy's Day in May. And when he starts playing sports he'll stink of sweat. Mum. Why are you always smiling? Well, there's no point being depressed all the time. But you're never depressed. You're smiling all the time. Ever since Dad died. —Miyu... —Mum. Take a day off tomorrow. Why? I just want you to. I can't. It's too last minute. I have to work to feed the baby. What do we do if it turns out to be a big eater? My last day. Miyu? Tiger, have you seen Miyu? No, I haven't. Maybe she's at a friend's house. I guess she's at a friend's house. I'm going to be late. See you later, Tiger. It's really sunny. Final chapter? I didn't say she could finish it. Catman: Final Chapter Miyu. We've had so much fun. You can look after yourself now. Boom! No! Don't go! A twist. Dad... where are you? Dad, don't go! Take me with you! Dad! Miyu, I love mew. Dad! What kind of an ending is that? They both died. Wait... 3 March 3 March: Marriage Proposal 12th Anniversary Observation Deck Miyu. Don't do it. Tiger? How did you know to find me here? You had me so worried! I came here every year with Mum and Dad. We would have a picnic here looking out at the sea. It was so much fun. Was it? You were always complaining about how cold it was or how your feet hurts. Let's go home. Your mum's waiting. Miyu, what are you doing? Tiger. If I stay here, will Dad come for me? What? If he does I'm going to hit him so hard. You would? And then... I'll go with him. No... even if you die, we'd never meet. You'd be in heaven, and I'd be in hell. Besides, I'm right here. Miyu, can't you tell it's me? Stop it! I told you not to do that. You're just like Dad! Miyu! Cats are amazing. That was scary. Tiger! Are you all right? I'm so sorry. Miyu. Today is my last day here. I'm sorry about everything. You can do it. You'll be a wonderful sister. I feel sorry for the baby. Being born into this dirt-poor family. This is all Dad's fault. Stupid Dad. I never want to see him again. I hate him. Miyu! Natsuko. Don't worry, she's fine. Don't be angry. She needed space to work things out. Welcome home. I'm sorry. No, you say "I'm home". I'm home. Observation deck? Yeah. I'm sorry too. Today was an important day. Dad dozed off on the toilet with me in his arms. Mum was amazed. He does it all the time but it was especially funny today. Oh. That's great. It's thanks to you. Remember what you told me? "You're a cat, so just be with him." Is that... really true? I can't handle it. Seeing the two of them. I'll be like a cat and just sneak off without... Don't do that. I told you when we first met. There are things that only we can see. Dad... held me in his arms. He said, "Thanks. You're so warm." "You're a mischievous girl" "but you have the purest heart." "You're a sweet, kind girl." Maybe, right at the end I managed to make amends after all. What do you mean... I finally get it. No matter how bad your life is there's something that only you can leave behind. So you must never give up. What are you talking about? You mean you used to be human too? That's creepy. Is this a test? Miyu. Want to hear Dad's last words? Last words? What you say to a loved one before you die. Well, I'd like to think of that as his last words. What did he say? Crap, we have less than two hours. Don't worry, we can do it. Once we're done we'll have sukiyaki with Miyu. I'll be dead by then. People don't die that easily. Natsuko. When I die, you mustn't cry. Why not? I've said so many stupid things. So just laugh at how stupid I was. That's silly. After I die make Miyu smile for me everyday, OK? Just sayin'. So that's why you're always smiling? I see. Dad actually said something good for once. No, he didn't. It's easy enough to say. "Don't cry." "Make Miyu smile." But it's impossible to do. He goes off and dies. Leaving us with no money. Just memories. Of course I'm going to cry. What else can I do, Suzuo? You're so stupid! But you know what? From the day... I met your dad 20 years ago he had always been there for me. Thanks to him I learnt to like myself. No matter how bad things were I could always laugh. And so... I was happy. I... really wish we had more time with him. I wanted to tell him I love him. Mum, I miss Dad! You're back again, requesting to be human. Yeah. I've already said no to you before. I don't want to die yet. But you will. In just under three hours. But I can't die. They have given me so much happiness but I haven't left them anything. Please, I just need one day. Please make me human. I can't do that. But why, Your Honour? Isn't that obvious? If the dead comes back to life everyone would be shocked. Just one day. How would that stop them from being shocked? Mr Takahata, every life comes to an end. Trust me. You must accept your fate. I know more about death than... Listen. Have you... Have you ever witness a birth? I have. I saw Miyu being born. Birth is a miracle. Something that you've never seen before suddenly appears right before you. After that, whenever I held her or walked with her... I would always have the same thought. All I need is Miyu by my side. That's a miracle in itself. I want to thank her for that miracle. Even cats repay people's kindness. And also I finally know what I want to leave them. And what's that? Manga. That's all I can do. Finish Volume 11 of Catman. For them. In three hours... No... I'll have it done by morning. Your Honour, I'm begging you. Even if you do that, you'll still die. I know. And I'm fine with it. Right, who's next? Ouch. Miyu, have you brushed your teeth? I'm going to. Is it raining? No, it's not. I thought it'd be raining all night. Thank you, Your Honour. Mum, where did Tiger go? Don't worry, he'll turn up. Good night. Crap, I'm running out of time. Catman: Final Chapter Dad? Is this a dream? Yeah, it's a dream. I missed you so I'm here in your dream. You're drawing manga? Yeah, the final chapter of Catman. You're ending it? Yeah, and there will be no sequel. Just like life. I hate it. That's too sad. Don't worry. I'm always going to watch over you and Mum. You're warm, even in my dream. Yeah. Dad. I'm sorry. Why? I'm sorry for saying I wished you were dead. And for saying I hated you. I love you. And I was glad you came to my school for Parents' Day. I know. I knew all along. Dad. This is a dream, but I'll remember it, right? Yeah. You'll remember it. For ever and ever. I'm sorry too. I'm sorry... for dying. I was... such a bad dad. I wanted... I wanted to be with you longer. Miyu. It's OK. You'll be... all right. Time for bed. Suzuo? Where did Tiger go? He must be hungry. Miyu, are you listening? —I'm going to look for... —Tiger... isn't coming back. Cats have the habit of sneaking off without telling anyone. That's the only thing Dad liked about them. Is that... The final chapter of Catman. Dad did it. Here, last night. Come to think of it... I dreamt of him last night. What was your dream about? I don't remember. But we were laughing, me and him. Let's read it. It looks rushed. Well, that's just like him. It needs some cleaning up. Where? I'll do it. He always missed out a few spots. Still, he worked hard on this. Yeah. The Cat-father by Takahata Miyu Catman: Final Volume Miyu-sensei. I've finished the backgrounds. Thanks. The Bell Of Happiness 3 March: Marriage Proposal 24th Anniversary I love mew!
