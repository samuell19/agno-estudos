ANIMAL: Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I really don't know what to say, except we're really glad you liked Manhattan Melodies. We all worked hard to make it the best Senior Variety Show ever. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] Hey, Kermit. Next time we'll see you on Broadway. Heh. Yeah. Yeah, sure. That's a great idea. Why don't we take Manhattan Melodies to New York. What? Yeah. Broadway is dying to get a great musical like this. Broadway? Thanks, everybody, for having so much faith in us. It's not often that a frog and a bear and a pig and a chicken and a whatever even get accepted into college. We're all so proud to be graduating now. Some with honors- [WOMAN SCREAMING] ANIMAL: Woman! Woman! Woman! Woman! Woman! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And some with the help of daily psychological counseling. Uh, anyway, thank you again. Thank you for everything, guys. Thank you. Yeah. Back at you. Thank you. Broadway? PIGGY: Yes, yes, yes. But this show's not good enough for Broadway. And the script needs a lot of work. I still think something's missing. FOZZIE: No. No, no, it's fine, Kermie. Really. Remember you said we could not get married until we had enough money? Yeah. Well, we'd have enough if we had a hit on Broadway. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Broadway of what city? ALL: Gonzo. What did I say? What did I say? Well, even if the show was good enough, we're all just graduating. What about our future plans? Well, this could be our future. Yeah, yeah. That's right.

You're getting the walls messed up. What do you think, guys? What? How do you like it? Much better than that cement mixer I lived in. I'll trade with anyone that has a Jacuzzi. Come on, it's just for one day. We'll all be on Broadway tomorrow. ALL: Yeah. [♪♪♪] We'd like to see Mr. Price. WOMAN: Do you have an appointment? KERMIT: No. But we've got this great show called Manhattan Melodies that he'll wanna produce on Broadway. It's about kids that come to New York to marry and has a wonderful opening number. It goes like this. Hit it. SECRETARY: Hold it. Hold it. MAN [OVER INTERCOM]: What's going on out there? Just a frog with a musical, Mr. Price. A musical? Send him in. KERMIT: Okay, guys, let's go on in. MAN: Net, I'm talking net. You gotta be kidding with gross. GONZO: Ooh, nice upholstery. Hold it a minute. I'll get back to you. Uh, Mr. Price, I'm Kermit, and these are my friends. We've got a show that you'll wanna produce on Broadway. It's about kids that come to New York to marry and it opens with a great number. It goes like this: [BAND PLAYING] ♪ Look at me, here I am ♪♪ Frog, frog. No singing, okay? Just give me the general idea. It's all about life in the big city. PRICE: In the big city, huh? With cops, shootings, car chases, that kind of thing? KERMIT: Well, no. No shooting stuff. It's more like songs and dances. Songs and dances? GONZO: Yeah. That might be interesting. Nobody cares about shootings anyway. Are you thinking big-name stars? Actually, we're gonna be the stars. That's exactly what I was about to say. You be the stars. Unknowns. Songs, dances, shootings. ALL: Mm-mm. No. No shootings. ALL: Mm-mm. Mm-mm. You know what? KERMIT: Huh? I smell something. [ALL SNIFFING] Why does everyone blame dogs? No, no. What I smell is a hit. KERMIT: A what? A hit.

But I'd like you to read the script. There's still something missing- Don't worry. We fix those things in the previews. I've gotta call the papers, rent a theater, and I need $300 from you. Three hundred dollars? Yeah. Apiece. Apiece? Today. Yeah. What? Fellas, that's standard Broadway procedure. You give me money, we start rehearsals tomorrow. But we don't have... Kermie, I don't think that's right. Yeah. Now I smell something. Fellas- SECRETARY: Mr. Price? There are two police officers outside. They'd like to speak to you. That's him. That's Murray Plotsky.

She's hyperventilating. She needs mouth-to-beak resuscitation. Kermit, he never wanted our show. He just wanted our money. Gonzo, is Camilla all right? Yeah, but I think we're engaged.

I bet he's back there getting soup bowls for everybody. Really? With soup in them? Uh-huh. I gotta get back to work. I had a test today, so I came in late. Yeah, I heard you passed the test.

You know, maybe your fashion designing can help me now. What do you mean? I did some reading about Broadway producers and investors and agents, and I know what I have to do to sell our show. I can use your help, because I have a three-part plan. And the first part is, if you can't beat them, join them. [♪♪♪] [CLEARS THROAT] Hi, sweetheart. I just flew in from the Coast. I love your hair.

I can't sleep either. Maybe if we snuggle... Hm? Oh. Mmm. Kermit. [♪♪♪] KERMIT: Hm. Here's one more. It's from Dr. Teeth. DR. TEETH: Dear Kermit: How's the man? We got this great gig here outside of Pittsburgh. [BAND PLAYING POLKA MUSIC] I tell you, frog, the band's wailing, the music's cooking. The crowd here is also wailing and cooking. Yeah, we're in hip city here. [ANIMAL GRUNTING] [CROWD CLAPPING WEAKLY] They're all doing pretty well. Yeah, they are. But, you know, there are no letters from Gonzo or Rowlf or Piggy. Oh, I'm sure they've written. Sometimes it just takes a while. Yeah, sure. Piggy's probably busy with some kind of terrific job. Yeah. Mm. I guess they're all out there doing terrific. If I could sell the show, everyone could come back and we could do it together, like in the old days. You'll do it, Kermit. Well, thanks, Jenny. [GLASS SHATTERING] [CRASHING AND PIGGY SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] That's been happening a lot lately. I know. Eh, it's New York. I'm ready for the second part of my plan.

Thank you. KERMIT: Piggy. Kermie? Are you okay? What are you doing here? Um... Sightseeing. Heh, heh. But you're supposed to be out of town. Yeah. I do not wish to discuss it in present company. Well, Piggy... Uh- That's okay, Kermit. I'll see you back at Pete's. Okay. I'm glad you're not hurt, Miss Piggy. Hmph. Piggy. Listen, what's going on? Well, vous is certainly looking different now. No gold chains, no shirt cut to the navel, no toupee. Hmph. Quelle différence. What's with all this French stuff? Uh... By sheer chance, I happened to learn French and get a job interpreting at the UN. What? Can I get my skates back, please? Just a second. How did you know about that toupee? None of your beeswax. Have you been spying on me? I'll unlace them while you fight. It's no trouble. Piggy, have you been spying on me? Maybe spying on vous and that certain young girl of the opposite gender. You two-timing her? No, it's just Jenny. She's a friend. She's trying to help me sell the show. He's gotta sell the show. What show? Well, if she is just a friend, then what about the huggies? What? The huggies. You gave Jenny the huggies? You know, maybe, Kermit, maybe it would've been better if we had never have met. Then you and Jenny would not be tormented by my presence. See what the huggies get you? Jenny and I hugged because we're friends. That's what friends do. Friends do not spy. Yeah, I forgot about that. I spied because I care. Well, I care too. Well, why don't you say so? I just did! All right! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Keep the skates. Keep the skates. I never use them anyway. I just like to run around in shorts.

GONZO: Thank you. Arriba! And thank you. Hey, you're a wonderful crowd. And now, for today's climactic act, look yonder. I will first make a death-defying leap from the loop-de-loop ramp, spinning and hurtling my body through the flaming circle of doom, and landing comfortably on the imitation-leather easy chair, while my chickens do their impression of Tony Bennett singing the "William Tell Overture. " Please. I must have silence. Are you ready? Thank you, Margaret. Hit it, girls. [CLUCKING "WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE"] Here we go. Ha-ha-ha! Oh, wait, I can't see. Whoa! I forgot my skis.

I'm in Delaware, and I found a terrific job in management. I'm surrounded by friends, and I love what I'm doing. [DOGS HOWLING AND WHIMPERING] I am Mr. Skeffington. One of my secretaries made a reservation for the weekend in the name of Snookums. Oh, yeah. This is Snookums. Mm. Daddy wants his little Snookie-ookums to be especially good this weekend while Daddy is gone, or he'll be very angry. Don't worry. We'll take good care of her. Him. We'll take good care of him. Snookums is a him. Snookums gets breakfast at 8 a. m. exactly. Breakfast is quiche. Yes, sir. Aren't you gonna write it down? Photographic memory. Write it down. Eh. "Dog gets quiche at 8." Whatever that is. Marvin, put him on the desk. Do you have any toys around here? What kind of toys would you like, sir? Doggy toys. Rubber balls. Rubber fire hydrants. Rubber newspapers. Snookums prefers rubber Wall Street Journal to the rubber Washington Post. Don't we all? Write it down. Yeah, rubber Wall Street Journal. Now, while Daddy is gone, little lumpy-dum-dums won't have his daddy to give him washy-scrubby. Very impressive. You speak Chinese like a native. Now, shake hands. Beg your pardon? Shake. Shake. Oh, yeah, yeah. Good boy. Now, sit. Yes, sir. Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay. [DOOR CLOSES] That was the most humiliating experience of my life. Hey, Snookie. Hey, look at little Snookie-ookums.

"Dear Mr. Kermit the Frog: I would be interested in talking with you about your musical, Manhattan Melodies. " "Come to my office at your earliest convenience. Sincerely, Bernard Crawford, Producer. " I've heard of him. He's a bigtime Broadway producer. Really? Yeah. Maybe he wants you to sign a contract. I better get over there right away. Oh, Kermit. Remember, just act confident like you know the show is gonna kill them. Right. Thanks, Jenny. Oh. Goodbye, Piggy. Call us and tell us what happens. Okay. Hey, watch it. I'm sorry. I have to get a contract, so I can go out and kill them. No. MAN 1: May I help you? I'm looking for Mr. Crawford. Are you Kermit the Frog? Yeah. Uh, I'm- I'm Mr. Crawford. Oh, really? Wow. Yeah. Oh, uh, the office boy is out getting lunch. You know kids nowadays, always eating lunch. Well, you wanna go in your office- No. No, uh, actually... Why don't we just have a seat over there for a minute, okay? Oh, sure. Yeah. You're very young to be a producer. You noticed that, huh? I started out when I was very, uh... Yeah. Look, can I tell you the truth? Mm-hm. The thing is that I'm not Bernard Crawford. I'm Ronnie Crawford. I signed my dad's name. I didn't think you'd come otherwise. But I wanna produce your show on Broadway. You do? Yeah. Yeah, I love it. It is so different. It's perfect for my first production. My dad and I have this agreement. MAN 2: Ronnie. I'm coming up the stairs, and I want my lunch. That's my dad. BERNARD: Ronnie. Now. Dad, I got great news. If you two are in love, I don't wanna hear. You promised I could have one chance to become a Broadway producer and that you'd get the sets, lights and scenery and everything. I wanna take that chance right now. Kermit has written a wonderful musical called Manhattan Melodies, and I wanna produce it. When do we hear the great news? Dad. BERNARD: All right, all right, all right. Tell me, Mr. Author, what is this musical? All dancing, all croaking? It needs a little work, because something's still missing. The two leads marry, and there's this song: ♪ Look at me, here I am- ♪♪ Hold it. Hold it. I'm allergic to amphibians singing. Who's gonna be starring in this masterpiece? Well, it's just me and my friends. You know, they're all dogs and bears and chickens and stuff. I told you, I wanna do something different. So put some Jell-O down your pants. Come here. Don't you realize it might be against the law having a chicken dancing onstage? RONNIE: What-? You're gonna go back on your promise? I didn't say anything of the kind. I'll do everything I said I would. Just because this is ridiculous doesn't mean it won't work. All right. When I started in show business- Thank you, Dad. Yeah, thanks, Dad. Ha, ha. See you later. Yeah. I gotta tell the whole gang. [PHONE RINGING] [♪♪♪] Hello, Pete's. KERMIT: Jenny? Kermit? Yeah. What happened? Kermit? We sold the show. The producer wants to put it on Broadway. Really? Oh! What? The producer said he's gonna put the show on Broadway. [PIGGY & JENNY SCREAMING] [PIGGY CLEARING THROAT] Tell Piggy she's gonna be a star. And, Jenny? I'd like you to do the costumes. Oh! Kermit, thanks. Kermit, Kermit. Kermie? Now that we'll be on Broadway, remember what you promised about getting married? Not now. We gotta write the gang and get them back. I'll be at Pete's in 10 minutes, okay? We did it. We did it. ♪ Together again ♪♪ [HUMMING] [HORN HONKING AND TIRES SCREECHING] [THUD] [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Pete, are you sure that Kermit wasn't at the bus terminal? No, he's no there.

Is peoples worrying, is peoples looking, is no come. But is peoples working, is water boiling, is come. Yeah. Peoples is peoples. [WHIMPERING] Piggy? Piggy, I'm sure Kermit's all right. Well, I bet he just got so excited about the show, he lost track of time. No. No, he's missing. I know it. Piggy. Aren't you excited? I mean, just think, you're gonna be on Broadway in a few months. RONNIE: Two weeks. The show opens in two weeks. Hey, place is closed. I'm Ronnie Crawford, I'm producing Kermit's show. Oh. Well, we're Kermit's friends. I'm Jenny. I'm her father. The show opens in two weeks? Well, my dad said tha- I'm letting my dad help out with the show. He said that we could have the sets, props and costumes, everything, but the show has to open in two weeks. Did you just say Kermit is missing? The writer and the star of my show is missing and we open in two weeks? No sweat. Come, Piggy. We'll find him. Wait. We gotta get his friends here, those bears and chickens and things. Right. Could you send telegrams to Kermit's friends? Oh, please? Okey-dokey. Let's go. Great. Come on. Is no sweat. I write good. "Dear bears and chickens and things: Is New York. Is play. Is time. " [♪♪♪] [SNORING] Kermit needs me. Beth, Beth, Beth. Wake up. Hey, I'm going to New York City to be on Broadway. I'm up. I'm up. Is it spring? All right. I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. Hey, guys. We're going to New York. Hey, girls. We're going to New York. [CHICKENS CLUCKING] We're going to New York. Yeah. Yeah! Right, right, right! New York City. Oh, boy! DOCTOR: Good morning. Ah, I see we've had our breakfast, haven't we? Hi, doctor. Well, how's our amnesia patient this morning? I don't know. I haven't been feeling like myself lately. I tell you what. If I may, I'd like to check your reflexes once again today. Just take a second. A little slow and confused. But that's to be expected, because, as you know, you have amnesia. I'm gonna check to see that there are no physical injuries one last time. Ha-ha-ha. Tickle? Now this might hurt just for a minute. But it'll be over soon. Ah. Ah. Adequate musculoskeleton response. Now, I want you to take a deep breath. This will hurt. [GROANING] All right. No rotator-cuff dislocation. Now let's try the mandible. Peachy. No doubt about it. You have amnesia. The problem is, you were found with no identification, and oddly enough, wearing no clothing. So I did some research into the major nudist colonies in the area, and I think I've come up with something. You are Mr. Enrico Tortellini of Passaic, New Jersey. Well, I really don't feel Italian. Oh. It was just a long shot. Mr. X, I'm sorry to tell you this, but your case is hopeless. Why don't you find a job, make a new life for yourself. And what we can do for you is give you a nice, clean set of clothes, wish you good luck. Thank you, doc. [♪♪♪] [HUMMING] PIGGY: Hey, everybody. Listen, everyone. Listen. Listen. [PIGGY WHISTLES] - so I said, "Look, buddy, I don't take my clothes off for anyone, even if it is artistic. " Uh- Oh. Janice, everybody, please. I'm glad to see you too. But I've been trying to tell you that Kermit is gone. He's disappeared. ALL: What? FLOYD: Kermit disappeared? [♪♪♪] Excuse me. Yes? KERMIT: I'm looking for the Gordon Employment Agency.

How about: "Ocean Breeze Soap. It's just like taking an ocean cruise, only there's no boat, and you don't go anywhere. " Seems a bit long. [GIL & JILL GROAN] Have you tried something simple like: "Ocean Breeze Soap will get you clean. " Wait a minute. Wait just a second. You mean just say what the product does? Why, no one's ever tried that. Well, it's crazy. Why, it's nuts. ALL: We love it. Thank you, Phil. If we can ever do something for you, let us know. Well, I kind of need a job. ALL: Hmm.
