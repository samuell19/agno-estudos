She's a police woman Doctor I'd like you to meet a colleague from Scotland Yard Miss Eve Please... sit These last months, we've had a lot of big jewelry robberies here They've all been extremely professional jobs Which leads us to believe we're dealing with a single well-organized outfit And that's why we sent for Miss Eve She's going to form a special action squad To try to find out who's behind this Now then, the obvious thing we'd like to find out here Is where the stuff's going to And we're pretty sure it's been shipped out of Hong Kong One thing for sure, they can never unload that much here in Hong Kong We've been on to every dealer here, and they know nothing Inspector Lu, the Tokyo Police Has brought us a ruby they picked up there The stone's been identified as coming from the second big robbery here So we know where that lot went to The shots are from Korea And all the victims were killed with a knife All those girls were from Hong Kong So our assumption is Those young girls were used to smuggle out the jewels from Hong Kong Once the job was done, that was it The gang killed them The reason they're killed, is to stop the leaks But on the other hand, that means The gang always have to keep finding new girls, for each job So we're going to form a squad of girls and you'll be the girls First, we'll try infiltrate this gang And so you'll pose as show-girls, that's what the dead girsl were Right, let's introduce ourselves I'm Ynag Che-sin I'm Kao Chen-chen. I"m from Korea And I'm from Japan. I'm Lu Ping Now just bear in mind This gang is quite ruthless, and real vicious So you're going to be risking your lives One false step, and you're going to wind up dead And so at this point I want to make it clear to you None of you is being forced to take on this job It's quite voluntary Oh we accept You can only speak for yourself What about the others? You accept it, don't you? Mm You, Lu Ping, do you want out?
