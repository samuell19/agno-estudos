[building suspenseful music] Goddammit, save it for the ring! [grunting and scuffling] [soft mumbling] - Take him off this round, chief. - Thanks. - Don't embarrass me. - It's sparring pep talk, Hal. Fighting a school bully is not the same as fighting for the Heavy Weight Championship of the world however, prize fighter Jake Raye can still give us some valuable tips on the art of self defense. Right, Jake? - Right. - [Hal] Four, three, two, one. [exploding] - Hal, you ever wonder why we do this? - No. Oh hey kids, time to hit the bag, you got any questions? Jake Raye will answer them for you. - Are you really a champion? - No, never fought for the title. - [Kid] Why not? - [Kid] Look at that scar. - [Kids] Whoa! - Where'd you get that? - My brother was in a motorcycle accident, needed a kidney. Actually it was my half brother, but I gave him my whole kidney. And you can't fight with one kidney it's like suicide so I had to give it up. - Come on, how'd you really get it? - Okay come here. Alright, 10 guys right? [phone ringing] And they surrounded me with knives, all of them had knives. All the knives went in the same spot. - [Kids] Whoa! - [Hal] Yo, it's your brother on line one. - Mike? Where's he calling from? - Operator said Manila. Manila. - [Jake] Hello? - Had some great times there once. - I can't hear, who is this? [tense music] [low speaking] - Where? [low speaking] [low tense music] - I'm going to Manila. [laughing] - [Hal] Great, go start a chain. - That was the police. - What did the police want? - Mike, they found him in an alley they want me to claim the body.

Please be sure to check the overhead racks for personal belongings and thank you for flying with us. [place whooshing] [gentle instrumental music] [people chattering] [speaking in foreign language] - Please, I am lost how far, this address? - [Man] Just down the road. - Thank you. [chattering in foreign language] [laughing] [energetic instrumental music] [woman yelling] [grunting and scuffling] [chattering] - No, no more. - It's China Town, Jake. [yelling] [muttering in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - [Man] There, that's your brother. [gentle instrumental music] - [Detective] The broken neck, the shattered spine and general hemorrhaging. A work of art, graphic killing. At least a few, it was the wrong pat of town for your brother. [speaking in foreign language] I am having an investigation, now move! Go! - What's this? - Found that in your brother's hand. - What is it? - Polyester. Mr. Raye. - All he has to wear. - I can imagine your thoughts just now. I advise you in the strongest of terms leave Manila today. We will get in touch if necessary. [birds calling] [gentle instrumental music] - I'll find them, Mike. [grunting] [laughing] - [Man] Can't beat me. Don't give me that. [birds chirping] [cars whirring] [chattering]] - Don't ever push me like that. Don't you ever lay your hands on me, You don't know what you're talking about. [arguing] Don't give me that. [door squeaking] [gentle intense music] [grunting] [dramatic instrumental music] [low suspenseful music] [grunting] [students shouting] [students grunting and yelling] [cracking] [dramatic suspenseful music] [whooshing] [grunting] [yelling] [applauding] [dramatic suspenseful music] [people chattering] - Damn! [birds chirping] Excuse me, excuse me please, I'm in a hurry. I had a black bag. - Always in a hurry, always rush rush rush. [laughing] You like? - [Jake] Beautiful, please my stuff. I had a black bag right over here behind the bush. - Come. They will not follow you here. - [Jake] Who won't? - Guards from the Red Fist. [chuckles] You fight well, I like that. [babies cooing] You left it, let someone steal it. - Thanks. [upbeat instrumental music] [people chattering] - I'm Nachu Kwong - [Jake] Jacob Raye. - Call me Kwong. - [Jake] Jake. [chattering] - Hey hey, lay off her, pal! - [Man] What's it to ya, man? - Paly, lay off her. It's your deal. Listen, you get lost-- [speaking in foreign language] - Fighters for the Bloodfist. Bloodfist is a boxing club. Last one from the 19th century. - Club, you mean like a gym? - Not unless for gambling. There's more money spent on gambling than on food, but gambling is illegal so the richest of the rich form a club for gambling. Of course for training warriors. - Warriors? - Kick boxers. Every year the Red Fist holds a competition, Ta Chung it is called. Much money for the champion. - Hey! What the fuck are you staring at, man? - Nothing. - I said what the fuck you staring at man? - I'm staring at nothing. - Okay. - Is there a problem? - Yeah, faggot, you're my problem, quit staring at me. Hit me. Hit me, man. Nothing personal. [yelling and scuffling] All the money I have in the world is on the table, try to bluff 'em. 'Cause a pair of twos. - A pair of twos? - I know. Thanks! You son of a bitch! Throw me the table, we'll split the winnings! That hurt! [shouting] [speaking in foreign language] [laughing] - No more man, no more man, I can't take it. [laughing] - [Jake] I bet you weren't too happy about that pair of twos. - Hey listen, I almost forgot, man, here's your share. - Forget it. - I owe you, man. Look, I live right here. I'll take you to dinner. Come on man, you're new here, what do you say, I'll show you around? Come on are we on or not? - [Jake] You live right here? - [Baby] Sure, this is it! - [Jake] See you around, Kwong. - Home sweet home. [upbeat singing] - So, Baby's your nickname? - Nah, Baby's my real name. My parents argue all the time. Couldn't agree on what to call me. [laughing] [gentle instrumental music] [speaking in foreign language] - How long have you been there? - Not long enough, you're very flexible. - Oh god, another American. - Baby's downstairs, he's not feeling too good. - You got him drunk, didn't you? He certainly didn't get drunk on the 10 pesos I gave him. - Look, lady, I don't know what's with you two, all I did was bring him home. Actually, he brought me home. - Southern California, the valley, right? Baby, Baby! - Oh, this is Jake. - [Nancy] We met. - He's staying with us. Jake, this is my sister, Nancy. - And now would you? Trust me, he will not be offended if you don't take him up on his offer. - Sorry, a deal's a deal. - What deal? - He owes me dinner. - [Recording] Very good, where is the service station? [speaking in foreign language] My car has broken. [speaking in foreign language] My broken car needs service. [speaking in foreign language] - You really are a valley boy, aren't ya? Better? - We'll see. It's like trying to dial a telephone with your ear. [laughing] - [Nancy] I was a translator in Hong Kong Till Baby came over and wound up in jail. It's amazing, you can drop him anywhere on earth and he'll find a party, you know? Oh, family. Anyhow, by the time I got him bailed out and sobered up, I lost my job. So here we are, so that Baby can rich on the Ta Chang. - [Jake] And you dancing. - [Nancy] Kinda. You didn't say why you were here. - [Jake] No, I didn't. - Your brother. He was fighting in Ta Chang, I was his trainer until he died. - Who killed him? - I don't know. What do the police say? - Nothing. - This was in his hand. - Better known Ta Chang. - [Jake] How many? - 20, 30 including the semi finalists. - How do I get to them? - [Kwong] That's your other boxer's problem. - Great. - Just-- - Shoot. - Only competitors and invited guests are allowed in Ta Chang, you must compete. It's the only way into the club, it's the only way to find the killer. - First of all, I'm not sure if that is the case. - I can assure you. - Second of all, I've given up fighting. - We have a month before the finals, we can train. - And third of all, what's your stake in all this? Why are you so concerned? - Fight like your brother, it's all passion. No plan, no strategy. Passion can't be learned, I teach strategy. - That's no answer, Kwong. I'm an American, remember? Just give me byline. - [Kwong] I take 40% of the winnings. - Great. - $100,000 for the winner. Think about it. - So you're suggesting I take his place. - Resurrection of a sort. You can win, you're half way there already. - I didn't come here to box, I gave that up a long time ago, I came here to find his killer. - Don't you forget. - Yo, brought you breakfast. - Oh, what's going on? - Turns out Jake has almost as many secrets as you. - No shit. Who's Jake? - [Nancy] Who's Jake? Who's she? - Oh no, her again. - Excuse me, your majesty. - Oh her again, she won't leave me alone. - [Mike] Lighten up little, brother. It's a photo session not a firing squad. - [Jake] Yeah, you come back from the Philippines, then I'll smile. - [Mike] Some come along. - [Jake] Somebody's gotta stay and run the store. It's all the future we've got. [camera clicking] - You're still thinking about the money I owe you. - [Jake] I'm thinking about the kidney you owe me. I mean what are you gonna do without me fighting your battles for you? - [Mike] I don't know, win a few maybe? [chuckles] - Kwong. - I am a man of peace but I tell you now, if my brother was killed like yours was, I would become a warrior. [birds chirping] - When do we start? - We already have. [speaking in foreign language] Know your enemy and you know yourself. In a thousand battles you will not perish. Ah, Art of War, better known to Americans as book of yuppie wisdom. Ta Chung. [scuffling and fighting] Only competitors stay here. - And I thought LA was bad. - Yu Tung Pin, he's named after one of the 80 mortal towers. A god how moved so fast, he was invisible. [grunting] Raton. Jumper, very calm. [grunting and speaking] The dance of death, with some fine chaos and noise, Raton uses the music as inspiration. - Yo, Captain America, Captain America! This guy's tougher than I thought. Hey, don't worry I'm bluffin', I got all the money back in the finals. - Pair of twos. - You know it, daddy-oh. - What if you had to fight your friend? - [Jake] We'll see. [grunting and scuffling] - [Kwong] Black Rose, he will be hard to beat. [yells] Chin Woo. Champion last year. [yells] He grew up in Vietnam, a victim of Nepal. He takes revenge on the world by often killing opponents. - [Jake] No room at the gym? - [Kwong] All morning, best gym in the world. - [Jake] Huh? - [Kwong] Over there. [dramatic instrumental music] Every morning, you race against the sun. The Americans are competitive, yes? - [Jake] Can be. - It's three kilometers to the top. You must make it there before the sun reaches its apex. - What do I get? - Mango. - Thanks. [inspirational instrumental music] [fighters shouting] [trainers shouting] - [Jake] What is that smell? - [Kwong] Goat shit. - Where's it coming from? - You box. We kick box, who has the advantage? Guy with two gloves or with four? [inspirational instrumental music] - When the sun sneaks in. - No mango. Perhaps tomorrow. [gentle instrumental music] - Don't force it. Relax your muscles, you want them to feel like they work together not like they're pulling apart. See how tense these muscles are here? Feel mine. Give me your hand, lean back, I got ya. You know there's something about that Kwong. - [Jake] Kwong's alright. [speaking in foreign language] - Well. [speaking in foreign language] - Where'd he get hat like that? Damn! [speaking in foreign language] [suspenseful instrumental music] [speaking in foreign language] Hey! [speaking in foreign language] Where'd you get this? English! [speaking in foreign language] Speak English! - [Nancy] What's going on here? - He's got Mike's hat, he knows something! [speaking in foreign language] - He didn't do it. He's talking too fast. - Slow down! [speaking in foreign language] - He says he was there, he saw everything. - What'd he see? [speaking in foreign language] - A snake, a big snake. - A snake? - [Officer] What's going on here? - He knows who killed my brother. [shouts in foreign language] [glass breaking] - Better. - [Jake] Kwong, who's The Snake? - Sorry? - Is there someone in Ta Chang called Snake? - Possibly, I'm not familiar. - It would be to your advantage to delay me from finding my brother's killer. - There's one week before your first fight, what you need. - Is a sparring partner. - In this corner, the great Yankee Killer, Baby Lover Boy Davis. In the other corner, the impotent scourge of the Orient, Jacob You Gotta Love Him Raye. - [Kwong] That's enough! - Cool your jets, King Kwong. - Now for the sake of your friend, take this seriously. Now remember, in Ta Chang, there are no rounds, no rules, no referees, no points. Now you fight until one of you go down. You win or you lose. Begin! - Not bad. Hey pretty good. Mind if I try this one. [shouting] - Oh no no no no! Enough enough! - What? - You fight like women! Girls that fight! You, take him down. Jacob is not up to fighting. - I'm taking it easy on him. - He says your sister wore him out, fucking all afternoon. - Are you fucking with me, Kwong? - That is what he told me. [energetic instrumental music] - [Nancy] Baby! Baby! - Good. - [Nancy] Why? - [Kwong] You soften him. - [Nancy] What? - When he finds his man, he will have to kill. - I understand that. - No you do not. A man in love is not a killer. A man in love is of no use to anyone. [electronic pop music] [people chattering] - More of that. - Daiquiri Martni for Mr. Thayer. [electronic pop music] [gentle instrumental music] [electronic pop music] - [Man] Let me show you how's it's done. Come on, babe. [scuffling] - [Nancy] No, you'll kill him! There's some things you just have to do. [gentle instrumental music] - Tomorrow, your first fight. - I'm ready. - Good. [building intense music] [applauding] [clapping] - [Announcer] May one and all another man of Ta Chang. [audience applauding] [women chattering] [dramatic instrumental music] - [Kwong] The guilty man reveals himself. One of these men is your brother's killer. But first you must face yourself. You have four matches in four days. Lose one and you're out. Use this. player's card. What the enemy does not see, you cannot expect. - Hey captain, placed a bet on you. - How much? - 6,000 pesos. - Is that a lot? - I don't know. Do it. Hey sis. - Good luck. Both of you. - Don't need it. That is unless I draw Chin Woo. [audience clapping] - Davis, Desert Fox. [cheering and chattering] - [Announcer] Davis versus Desert Fox. [audience shouting] - Piece of cake. - [Child] Mister. [speaking in foreign language] - [Man] Invitation. [audience shouting and clapping] [suspenseful music] [audience applauding] - Chin Woo versus Mukasa. [grunting and scuffling] Alvarez verus Pompeii! [audience cheering] Black Rose verus Helgato. [audience applauding] [clapping] - Raye, Raton. [speaking in foreign language] - Invincibility depends on oneself. The enemy's vulnerability on him. - Sure doesn't look vulnerable. - Attack early and hard, if he gets into trouble, he will need the table. That's when you crush him. [cheering and applauding] - Go to your corner, you there, you over there. - Let's get pieces in place, good. [audience shouting] [grunting and scuffling] [audience applauding] [building intense music] - [Recording] My broken car need service. [speaking in foreign language] [scuffling and grunting] The tires are flat. [speaking in foreign language] My oil pump fastener. [grunting and scuffling] Congratulations on your tape. Let's go on to lesson six. [cheering and applauding] [upbeat instrumental music] - I put my money on Chin Woo any day. - Chin Woo is nothing! ♪ Listening to the music - $1,000 in your name, 20% taken off of course. - Whatever. - You fought well today. - Thanks. - You will find him, soon. - [Nancy] Congratulations. - Thanks. I feel guilty. - Why? - I enjoyed it so much. I mean, why am I fighting? To fight or to find Mike's killer? - Your brother's picture, why don't you give it to me and I'll show it around tomorrow. See if the emperors know anything. Kwong thinks your falling in love with me. - Kwong has a big mouth. - Forget I said it. [gentle instrumental music] - Oops, sorry, keep it up, forget it, see ya later. Oh the view, you want to show me the view. Oh. Whoa! Great view. [cheering and applauding] [clapping] - [Announcer] Turner, Black Rose. [cheering] - [Kwong] You're late! - I slept in. - You've got a few more days, a few more fights, concentrate! [audience applauding] [energetic instrumental music] Chin Woo versus Hoison. [applauding and cheering] Davis versus Hulimon. [applauding] Tung Pin versus Raye. [intense instrumental music] - You know what this sport needs? A shot clock. [applauding] - [Hal] Hey my man, I just got in I'm looking for, hey kid, you! Where'd you get that shirt? The shirt? - You like? - Nah nah nah. I don't want it. This guy here, Jake, where can I find Jake? You know where I can get him? - Come on. - Alright. [giggles] - She knows who you are, a lot of people think you might win. - [Jake] Did you find anything out? - Yes and no. Your brother wasn't very popular. They say a guy died that he fought, it was all hushed up. Look, the word around here is that all Mike cared about was money. That he'd do anything to make it, win or lose. - You mean take a dive, that's not Mike. Is that all you got? You got any facts? - I know what a snake means. It's gambling term. A rat is an outside chance, fox is an underdog and a snake is a front runner, the favorite. - Who's the favorite? Who's the favorite? - You. And when your brother was alive, Chin Woo. - Hey hey, Jake my man, this is the life right here. How's it going, babe? I'm Hal, Jake's partner. - Hal, what're you doing here? - You know, when you start a business there's always some little thing that you don't think of that goes wrong. - What? - In this case, it was taxes. When the IRS started hammering on the door, I decided to take a little impromptu vacation. - Hal, everything I have is tied. - Listen, we'll talk about it tomorrow. Everything will be okay in the morning. [singing in foreign language] [gentle instrumental music] - This is usually a private moment. - I'm sorry. - My brother. My blood, he was killed in the Ta Chang. - I didn't realize you-- - [Kwong] Perhaps it is our brothers' deaths which bring us together, which make us alike. But we must not fight for them but for ourselves. They have found the reward. Come. [audience cheering and applauding] [grunting and scuffling] [shouting in foreign language] [energetic instrumental music] - Got him Jake, stay in there, stay in there! - Guy with the blue hat saw Mikes killer, stop him and I'll down this guy! [grunting and scuffling] [audience cheering] [intense instrumental music] Where is he? - His name is Lee, he'll see you tonight. - You better go! - It's alright, he gave me his address. He wants 3,000 pesos. - And then he'll tell me who the killer is. - That's right. - The things I gotta do to make a buck. Okay, listen up you little rats, this time we'll do it by the numbers. Number one, pull up the windshield wiper, number two, you place the paper against the windshield. Number three, you place the windshield wiper back against the paper, you got it now? You still don't have it. Am I getting through to you? No I'm not. Bruce Lee. - Bruce! - Yeah, now you got it! Off you go, put the paper in. Hey Jake my man, you in? - [Jake] Later, Hal. - Hey Jake, your guy there that guy, I know that guy. [low tense music] [dramatic music] [police siren blaring] - [Kwong] Police, go. - But I-- - Now! [low tense music] [shouting in foreign language] [audience applauding] - Chin Woo. - [Announcer] Chin Woo versus. - Davis. - [Announcer] Davis! [audience cheering] - Yeah but who killed the old man? - Forget about that, the police will take care of it. Think about the fight, nothing else. This is the last fight. Either Chin Woo or Baby, whoever wins out there. [cheering and shouting] [audience cheering and applauding] - [Announcer] Go to your corner. That corner. [audience cheering] [low speaking] [grunting and scuffling] [ominous music building] [ominous music building] [shouting] [machines beeping] - You're gonna be alright. You're gonna be okay. - Jake, tomorrow you fight Chin Woo, we must talk. - Not now. - [Kwong] I'm trying to help you. - You're just trying to help yourself. He'll come out of it, he'll be okay. - What does that mean, come out of it? That he'll only have minor brain damage? That his toes will work and his feet won't? He doesn't need this, Jake. You guys egging each other on. All that macho shit, you knew he wasn't good enough, didn't you? That could be you tomorrow. I need someone who's gonna be there for me. - [Officer] Stop! - Stayed here in Manila, huh? Perhaps for a longer time now. Inside the car. - What is this? You know I didn't do anything. - Be quiet! Let's go. Out! [low tense music] - Now perhaps you'll see I tried to help you. You are in deep trouble, my friend. Might I offer some advice? - How about offering to call the consulate. These charges are bullshit. I didn't kill that old man. - They do not see it that way. So I offer you advice. In bad times such as these, we must recall the routine of life. The sifting of sands, the changing of seasons, the precision with which that door will open at four p.m. to take you to arraignment. Now, so much for your soul, I offer you this ripe mango. - Hold it! - You must regain your strength for the day. - Kwong. - It is for both of us. [gentle instrumental music] [machine beeping] [gentle light music] - Chin Woo, Raye. [machines beeping] [clapping] - [Announcer] Chin Woo versus Raye. [machine beeps] - [Doctor] Give us some room here, please out of the way. Go ahead and do 50 milligrams of sodium carbonate. [speaks in foreign language] [audience cheering] [machine flatlining] - [Kwong] Kid. Did you eat the mango? - Kwong, you found something out, what is it? - [Kwong] Conserve your energy. - What are you holding back? [building tense music] - It is not right for you to fight for the wrong reasons. - Answer me. - You asked me once about a snake. I saw Chin Woo dressing. On his leg there is a tattoo of an asp. Deadliest snake in the world. He is your brother's killer. [audience shouting] - [Nancy] Jake, Jake? - [Jake] Nancy. - [Nancy] I wish you'd think twice about going out there. - Try and understand, I have to. - No Jake, you don't have to, you understand? You don't. - [Kwong] Jake, come. [audience cheering and applauding] [tense unsettling music] [audience cheering] [muffled unsettling music] - Stay down. - Jake! The trainer Kwong. He's from Modesto. He's a fighter fixer from way back. They call him the snake, he set you up, he wants you to lose. He's betting against you, against you! - Chin Woo! [low unsettling music] [gun fires] [building dramatic music] [audience cheering] - Hate to tell ya, pal, but it ain't over yet. Your man, Kwong, it finally clicked for me. Thailand back in the '70s. He always works with another guy, his brother that's it! - What about his brother? - Kwong promoted his brother and fought, they were a team. Fixer's always in with some kid they backed, they called him The Snake and it ain't changed. [low tense music] - [Kwong] I had all the time. No plan. No surprises. Straightforward. - I wanna hear the truth, while you can still speak. How's that for strategy? - [Kwong] The truth? Always so concerned with what is right. - You killed the old man, then you sprung me from prison just to gain my trust, you drugged me, bet against me. Is that what you did to Mike? - He did not have the strength to live up to our dreams. - So you killed him. - [Kwong] He betrayed me! - [Jake] So why the rest of it, Kwong? Why? - A resurrection. I told you. - The truth, Kwong. - I knew you would follow him here. I knew you could be persuaded to fight and to appear the favorite. You had so much passion. - So all you cared about was the money. - Your naivety stuns me. It was not about tradition or art. Or any of your boy expectations of the world. It is about money. [thunder cracks] - I know better, Kwong. Mike beat you and killed your brother. Admit it, your whole stinking life's been a lie. And it's vengeance you live for. - It is vengeance. You die for. [thunder crashes] [yelling and scuffling] [thunder crashes] [thunder crashes] [thunder crashes] Kwong! [low tense music] [thunder crashes] [yells] [dramatic suspenseful music] [dramatic music] - I taught you well. [thunder crashes] [gentle instrumental music] [gentle instrumental music]
