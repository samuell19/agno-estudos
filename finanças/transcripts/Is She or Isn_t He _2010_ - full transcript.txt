- So I've been online and I've met a man and we're taking our relationship to the next level and we're admitting we're boyfriend girlfriend. So I never thought there'd be guys out there who are straight, they like girls, but they just want a chick with a dick, isn't that the weirdest? - [Justin] Yes, does it worry you 'cause you're thinking of getting rid of your... - Oh no he doesn't mind that. - [Justin] Are you worried he might be gay? - I thought that, but he's not, so yeah. I'm not trying to look like a woman, I think I am a woman, an unfortunate one to have a penis, hairy, and fat. I've learned through the internet there are guys out there who love me that I have a penis. But I want to be a woman with a vagina. I want to be a heterosexual woman being loved by a heterosexual male. (jazzy organ music) - [Justin] I met Graham in Whangarei a few years earlier through a friend of a friend. - Oh, pretty. - [Justin] He told me that he was planning on becoming a woman and invited me to document his journey. At the time, I didn't realize I was committing to five years of filming. On the day we start, Graham is living in a sleepout at the back of his parents' house, but has not yet told his family about his plans. In fact, he's not even chosen a female name. - Elizabeth Taylor, doing a little bit of light research. Cindy Crawford, Basic Face. - [Justin] What for, research for... - Just on fabulousness. I don't know, women in the 50's were far more gorgeous and glamorous than what they are nowadays, really. I mean look at it, she's gorgeous. - [Justin] Is that what you'd like to look like? - Oh God no, I could never look that good. - [Justin] But what if you could look like anything, who would it be? What would it be? - The one, the only, the Audrey. She's just the best. As you can see, we look nothing alike. - [Justin] So you haven't decided when you're gonna tell... - Maybe Christmas. - [Justin] Christmas day? - Oh God no. Mind you, they'll say, well at least you got us a present. - [Justin] So you do fear it, it is a scary thing? - Oh, beyond petrified, it really is. - [Justin] Whangarei is New Zealand's most northern city, but with a population of only 50,000 people, it's possibly not the easiest place to be non-conforming. There are no gay bars here, and at 25 years old, Graham says that he's never even met another transgendered person. - I act all self-assured and absolutely out there and I am, but at the same time, I'm scared about what people might think or say now that I'm making such a larger, more obvious statement what I'm trying to do. I've chosen the name Ashleigh, and I've tried to tell people, try calling me Ashleigh, try calling me she, 'cause I thought at first, oh no just call me Graham, call me he, but if I think about it if I really want to start doing what I wanna be I have to start living like a woman as a woman. I told my mum, and I cried, and I don't know why, but you do, and I said I wanna become a woman. And she goes oh, then we had a hug. Which is odd 'cause we're not a hugging family, anyway. She told dad for me and I haven't spoken to him since about it, we haven't even bridged it. I mean I'm wearing makeup and stuff. - I had a suspicion for a long time that he was a bit different from other boys. But my wife, she was a bit tearful for a couple of days afterwards. But it didn't affect me like that, I just sort of take it in me stride. - [Justin] Why was your wife tearful? - [Shirley] She'd brought him up as a son, I suppose. - At work, they still call me Graham. They just can't seem to understand the difference between a gay person and a transgender. - [Justin] Do you explain that to them? - You try and like you say, just think of me as a chick, like with a deformity, or not, well literally a deformity, 'cause I'm not a man wanting a man, I'm a woman wanting a man. And they go oh yeah, I get it now. I just think they have these lapses of forgetfulness. I think once I start getting things done, I'm gonna notice the change and wanna make more changes, you know? It's just that I'm, I still don't like dresses 'cause they don't suit me. I don't like singlet tops 'cause I'm too fat as it is. Just like a fat woman would. I prefer pants any day I want to be considered really attractive. I wanna become a model, I thought being a model would be fun. I want to have beautiful big breasts that a guy would love. I want to be a heterosexual woman being loved by a heterosexual male. Not even have any doubts in him, like oh that's an odd-looking woman. My fear is I won't be passable. I don't want to look like a man, 'cause I've seen some, and there are just some men that wanna be women but they just don't look like women and my fear is I won't look like a female. - What's your plans in the long term? - [Ashleigh] I wanna be a woman. - In terms of having surgery? - [Ashleigh] Yeah everything. - You might well find if we increase the dose the maximum sort of dose is the both estrogen and spironolactone, that you will get less hair growth, more breast development. You might psychologically feel better, and you'll get a reduction in penile size as well, because you're trying to almost put someone into a eunuch state. - Estrogen, female. And TA, that is the testosterone suppressant. So this stops the little guys downstairs and this is to make me get pretty. - [Justin] How do you know that you will be happy with your body if you had breasts and a vagina? - It's just the fact that I'll be acknowledged as a woman, which is what I wanna be, and to be a woman, these things are important. I don't like being a man. But as I said, I've never been terribly masculine. - [Justin] You think it might've stopped you from being able to to be comfortable getting into a relationship with somebody? - Definitely because the relationship I want is a heterosexual relationship where I love a man who loves me back as a woman. - [Justin] And you'll be in a relationship with a straight man, not a gay man? - No not at all, 'cause I'm not gay. I know I'm a straight woman but for me it isn't a sexuality issue, it's a body issue. I always knew as a child growing up. I used to play in my mum's clothes in secret, wear the shoes. And when I was even younger mum used to say... - But transgender's different from transvestite and guys that like to dress up as girls. - [Ashleigh] Yeah. - I have to say when I first met you, I immediately jumped to a conclusion that you were someone who was confused, and that's what I thought. - Really? - Yeah, it was yeah. - Confused? - Yeah, someone who's just a bit mixed up about it and that you would eventually really regret the whole thing. And that was before I knew you, though, and that was just a total knee-jerk reaction. - [Justin] When you met Graham, did you think that he was just an effeminate gay man? - No, I don't know what I thought. I didn't think he was gay. He, oh you made me say he. I didn't think... - [Justin] But we're talking about Graham. - At that stage, yeah, no, I didn't think he was gay, and I wasn't sure what I thought at that point. I guess sometime in the last year, she's totally female to me now, totally. - [Justin] In reality, before she can be totally female, Ashleigh has a long list of physical changes that she wants to undertake, including major laser hair removal, breast implants, and genital reconstruction. - [Doctor] You can tolerate that? - [Ashleigh] I can. - [Doctor] You sure? - [Ashleigh] Mm hmm. - 'Cause if you don't complain I just keep going. - That's fine. - Bearable? - Yeah, I'll make it bearable. - [Doctor] We are done. - Move it fucker. - [Justin] So how long's this drive from home to get the electrolysis? What's the round trip take? - Probably four hours. But in this car, six. - [Justin] The 15 minute laser treatment costs Ashleigh $200. And she's been told that she'll need at least ten treatments on any part of her body where there is unwanted hair. It's becoming clear that she'll never realize her dream of transforming into a woman without a large sum of cash. And on her wages as a barista, Ashleigh fears she'll never get there. - I'm actually literally freezing my ass off right now. - [Justin] So you usually wear a body suit, do you? - Or a bra, depending on the jean. These are kind of like a snug fit. - [Justin] You have to tuck yourself in down below, do you? Between your legs? - Yeah, well no not really, it just squishes it up. - [Justin] Is there an art to that? - No I don't tuck or anything, 'cause I'm all flabby, I can sort of, and my penis is shrinking so it's kind of like you just stick it on. - [Justin] Really, is that what happens with hormones? - Yeah yeah yeah. - [Justin] To finance her transformation, Ashleigh needs to raise around $30,000. However, one of her brothers is looking to start a business, and offers Ashleigh the opportunity to open her own cafe. She's hoping that this might be a way to raise the money. - It's a complete dump. - [Justin] What's the arrangement? - We're partners in it. He brings in all the money and I bring in the four years experience in running a popular cafe here in Whangarei. It's like, 'cause people are saying how are you gonna raise the money? And we'd joke, I'd have to work the streets to raise the money but in reality, it's almost the only way a lot of people can probably do it and it's really sad. - [Justin] Ashleigh decides to name the business Narnia, after the fictional world featured in the fantasy books by CS Lewis. - But this will be the entranceway. You'll walk in here, and then around this doorway we're gonna have a big wardrobe, 'cause you know, Chronicles of Narnia, you walk through the wardrobe, and as you walk through, they'll have a fur coat on either side as in the storybook, and then you walk in through here and you're in the land of Narnia. And we're gonna have themes to Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, Harry Potter and just adolescent storybooks. And this is the main dining area. Someone suggested, oh we could do like a painted yellow brick road up to the counter and things like that. I'm gonna have a big clock in here but it's gonna be a big pocket watch, and I'm gonna drop like some big chandeliers I want more to over the top ones but over here on this side I'm just gonna have hundreds and hundreds of fairy lights just dripping all across the ceiling. That is my cafe, it's gonna be cool. - [Justin] Do you think you get to live in a bit of a fantasy world, being... - Yeah I suppose, I've never thought of it like that, I suppose so. - [Justin] Ashleigh is the youngest in a family of 13 children. As a boy growing up she says that people often mistook her for a girl, so she maintains that it's no surprise to her family that she's chosen to transform into a woman. Even though they never discuss it. - [Justin] Did you all just think that she was gay, when she was growing up? - No I don't think we ever saw her as gay, no just feminine. - Oh that's gold, that is gold. - [Justin] Is there anyone in the family who is having a problem with Ashleigh being transgendered? - If I was brutally honest, I suppose to a degree, we're all having a problem with it. I mean, literally brother Graham, physically, so there's probably little snippets in everybody that are sort of thinking that's my brother, how can it be happening? - Breasts. - [Justin] Do you know what kind of breasts you want? - I have no idea, big ones. - [Justin] Really? - Well I like all of them. - Hey Marilyn, I was wondering if I could speak to someone about breast surgery. Enlarge them. Alright, and what else did I need to know? I'm pre-op transgender, that won't make any difference into like the tissue around my breasts and everything that, yeah? Oh okay cool, and have they been quite happy? That's awesome, thank you so much for all your help. Great, bye bye. Not a problem, they've done some transgenders before, but it's between $8500 and $10,000. The price depends on when you get down there, I don't know why. What's that, 100 dollars a week? Oh my God, that's 10 weeks just for a thousand. - [Justin] That's only 5,200 in a year. - Yeah I know, I have to go faster. Oh that's right, 'cause Lindsay said he was willing to help out, the business, that's the purpose of owning a business, to help out with these sorts of things as well. It's all still very scary, I'm actually really really petrified. - [Justin] Well what are you worried about? - I don't know how much food to make or how little or too much, you know? - [Justin] By opening day, the cafe isn't looking like Ashleigh had dreamed. - Oh wow this is cool. - Oh thank you, it's still sort of work in progress, first day. Good morning, Cafe Narnia, how can I help you? - [Justin] But the reality of the first day's takings is encouraging. - Was it a good opening? - Hell yes, I thought we'd just be doing nothing. They're getting there. But not quickly enough. It's always the way, never quickly enough. - [Justin] So tell me, when you look at yourself in the mirror, do you see a woman or do you see a transgender person? - I think I look good, so I see a chick. I just see a hairy, big-looking chick, who looks like a rugby player, but that's fine. - She doesn't like to be introduced as a transgender because it's a little bit in your face, it brings a teach into it, and she doesn't like having a teaching brought to being transgender. And it took me a little while to understand that because at first I was like, but you are, so obviously not male, but really not female at that point either and so there needed to be some kind of introduction for people to know, we have to say he or she in front of her, you know what I mean? - [Justin] How would you respond if somebody hits on you? - If guys are attracted to me, usually it's sleazy, like it just comes across as a big gross, I don't know. Not that all guys are like that. 'Cause my fear is some guys might have a fetish for transgender, and therefore they just assume they're like every other one that's out clubbing and drugging and life is turning into a spiral mess, and I don't know easy prey or something, just for a sexual thing more than anything else and yeah that kind of grosses me out. But I've had one night stands and stuff. - [Justin] Did you enjoy the sex? - Well I only get blow jobs. I didn't want to, I don't like anal sex, so yeah. - [Justin] So you didn't get any pleasure? - Oh yeah I did, it was still fun, they're still doing something sexual, it was great fun, I love it, I'm really good at it too. But yeah so um, I don't know, it was fun 'cause it was doing something as a female, you know? When you're sucking off a guy's dick, or to me, that means you're a female, you know. - When Fiona Clark embarked upon this particular project in the 1970's it was a hugely controversial exhibition about transsexuals and transvestites and people who are differently gendered from that we considered in our conventional society at the time to be normal. And so the only other way of dealing with those people is to marginalize them. Many of the transgender people you see in these photographs are dead now, dead way before their time, their lives thrown away unnecessarily because of an uncaring society, frankly. - [Justin] The Go Girl exhibition is intended to be a celebration of transgendered women, but for Ashleigh, the exhibition heightens her belief that she's different from other transgenders. - Those tragic transgenders, they make transgender a hard thing, I think they make it an issue. Their family hate them, or no one loves me, I've gotta work the streets, they think it is so much that it is such a hardship that they are completely isolated, no one can understand them, but then they're creating that bigger deal, and it's not the big issue that it can be. - [Justin] Despite her negative view of the transgender community, Ashleigh maintains that she wants to undergo full gender reassignment surgery. Even though she's had little contact with anyone who's been through the procedure. I suggest to Ashleigh that she calls the transgender support group in Auckland to investigate attending one of their monthly meetings. - This is Ashleigh Tadman in Whangarei, how are you? When's the next meeting? This Tuesday coming? Oh cool, is there any chance I can meet you before I actually go to a meeting? Like just for a coffee or something, it's just that some of the people I've met, they're quite down on themselves and their families don't like them they say, and all that sort of thing and that's not my case at all, so. I won't say I like normality but before I go meeting lots of people I'd probably like to meet one just to get an idea, I'm sorry is that cool? Then you name a place and I'll just meet you there for a coffee. Okay that's cool, whereabouts do you live? Yep. Oh superrific, okay then if things come up I'll ring and cancel or change or whatever, so that'll be cool. See you later, bye bye. Freak of nature. I'm not about to go their house, what if it's icky and gross and unclean? I think, when I think if this was me, I think I'd want to meet people who'd done it. Ashleigh seems to be actively not seeking out anybody else that's been there. - Could be, she's always said to me that she's always thought of herself as female and so she didn't feel that she was, if you like transgender or ever a male, do you know what I mean? She just had the wrong body parts. She's always been a female, yeah. - [Justin] Around town, Ashleigh has started to become known as a local personality. She gets asked to host an amateur comedy night and jumps at the opportunity. - I figured it was a way of saving 15 bucks. - [Justin] How you doing, good? - Yeah, I'm petrified. It's like Granny Central. - [Justin] How do you think the grannies will respond to you being transgender? - [Ashleigh] I'm sure they won't even notice. - [Justin] You're not gonna mention it in any of your... - Oh wait there's my phone. No, God no. See I don't think of myself of transgender to make a point of it. I mean Georgina Beyer has and look what's happened to her, she's just known as that transgender MP, So if I go out there and start rattling on or making transgender comments or anything, then that's sort of setting me up that that's what I am, I don't want to be stigmatized like that. To even make it an issue makes it an issue, does that make sense? 'Cause I feel like anti-gay parades, because it's like, you gotta get over it, I don't see heterosexual parades. It just seems like if you're gonna create exclusion then you will be excluded. - [Justin] I think there's nothing wrong with recognizing people's differences and celebrating them. - Oh yeah absolutely, that I can agree with. But a parade about I'm a gay person, that just kind of seems stupid. - [Justin] Well it's showing pride, isn't it, that's the point? - I suppose, but it's over. Surely it's, okay we know gay people are out there, can we move on? - [Justin] Yeah but it's not completely over, there's a lot of people around here that would be uncomfortable with transgender. - I don't have a problem, I never run into it. - [Justin] You will. - Not really, it depends on how you go about it. - [Justin] Even one of your brothers is really uncomfortable with you. - With me, that's fine. - [Justin] Yeah with the transgender part of it. - Yeah I know but that's just because he doesn't understand 'cause he's a retard. - [Man] We're about I would say I'm imagining five minutes away. - Yeah that's cool. - [Man] I'm not sure exactly, I'll get a ring on the phone. - Alright, good evening, hello everyone. (cheering) - [Guy] Go Narnia! - Hey, here's a fan of my cafe. I ran into a couple of lady friends of mine, they're lovely people, one kissed me on the cheek. That's fine, okay, honey you look flippy, if anyone thinks I'm lesbian, I am not, okay? I prefer the pole so much more than the hole, alright? - [Justin] Ashleigh has now been taking female hormones for over two years. Her body is unlikely to transform much further without surgery which she says she's still saving for, but something has changed. - Stockings, bras. - [Justin] Ashleigh has started to wear dresses. - Socks, course I don't dress like this for work, I'm just in jeans and a T-shirt. Some of it's kind of a bit nunnery though, what do you think? Nunnery? - [Justin] Do you wonder why you weren't dressing like this sooner? - I guess I wasn't ready for it, but I don't know, it was getting over the fear to do it, and I've done it, and it's just so much better. - [Justin] How'd your mum respond when she first saw you in that dress? - Actually she was a bit like, oh, oh, don't go out looking like that. It's a matter about being comfortable with yourself, but how you'd always rely on other people accepting you. I didn't want to be one of those desperate cyber people but alas, I'm now one one of those desperate cyber people. So yeah. - [Justin] Do you think you're desperate? - [Ashleigh] To go on the internet looking for someone, yes. - [Justin] So you're wanting to go on some dates with some guys? - [Ashleigh] Yes, it'd be nice to go out with a guy, who's like I said, I've got lots of male friends but no one special. - [Justin] You're advertising yourself as a transgender? - [Ashleigh] Yeah, I have to. - [Justin] Have you met anyone? - [Ashleigh] No not yet. On the internet you can be sort of faceless to someone to begin with. You can literally say exactly what you want. You can sort of tell who's a bit sleazy and weird and who seems like just normal, but inevitably there's always a sexual innuendo with a lot of them. There's one or two that have emailed me and they seem really friendly and normal but I always want to be contacted by them because I just don't want any bad responses, 'cause I don't want to freak out like a transgender just emailed me. - [Justin] What kind of guys are responding to you? - Well a lot of them don't have photos, I'm not too sure, but they're young, they're old-ish. - [Justin] Do they all call themselves straight? - Yeah, that's what I like. - [Justin] Would you like somebody that was honest and kind and a good person even if you didn't they're physically attractive? - Well for me personally, being that I'm not physically perfect for a man, I'm not yet a woman, it's like who am I to judge what someone looks like? If they're willing to like me and stuff. - [Justin] So you are prepared to compromise because you feel that a man would be compromising by dating you. - I suppose yes. - Although I say she's very confident in being female I don't think she's as confident as she displays. I guess because she was struggling with these issues through puberty and she wasn't doing what the rest of us were doing which was playing with the other playing with the partners we were looking for. And so she is really innocent and naive in the ways of relationships and the world. - [Justin] Ashleigh's friend Maria said to me, Ashleigh really wants to get married one day. Could you imagine that? Would you be giving her away? - Well, it might be a quiet wedding. - [Justin] Why do you say that? - Well I dunno, but I suppose I could, yes I could do that. - [Ashleigh] I've never been close with my family, I don't agree with any of their choices in their lives, they don't agree with any of mine. - I think she has some really intense sadness sometimes, and she never shows that, but you see it sometimes. - [Justin] Ashleigh said to me once that she's lived a lie so long that she's just so used to performing and being, I just wonder if anybody really knows her. - It's amazing 'cause in this interview, I'm starting to say how much do I know about her choices? (phone ringing) - [Justin] So tell me what kind of guy is this? - He's 22, I met him online. He's a heterosexual male, he plays rugby, he's a builder, he's really cool and he just wants to hold me and hug me. (phone ringing) Sorry. Oh, send me another pic please, cutie. It's like a fixation with, they wanna see photos of you constantly. I don't know, for guys it's very visual I guess, I dunno. I can't believe you can see everything did you? - [Justin] I can't see, what did you say. - Oh thank God, I just said here's a picture of me I took the other night. - [Justin] Let's see the picture? - No. - [Justin] Why, was it, do you sending him something sexy? - Yeah. - [Justin] What was the picture of? - Just me, looking at myself. They're straight men, they say they're not gay, and that's true, it's just a little facet of them that they find attractive with a woman. To me, I didn't think there were guys out there who would be interested in it like that, and it's really cool but at the end of the day I want my vagina, it's not about having sex with a penis. It's hard to explain but I want that feeling of being a woman having made love to. So yeah. - [Justin] So are you scared about meeting some of these guys? - No, because I still chat away, I mean I'm 29 and a virgin, but I know about the birds and the bees and stuff, I'm aware of sex and everything about it, I'm not estranged to any of it, I just haven't done any of it, so yeah. - [Justin] So you consider yourself to be a virgin. - Yeah, technically I am. - [Justin] Why? - Because my penis hasn't penetrated anything. Isn't that what losing your virginity is? (soft piano music) - [Justin] So tell me who is this guy, how old is, and what's his... - Um, well, he's 22, he lives here in Auckland, and yeah I just met him online. I'm so excited about seeing him, I haven't seen him in two whole weeks. - [Justin] You're quite taken with him, aren't you? - Slightly, yes. He likes me, you know, he's not like, I've had so many male friends and stuff and it's always like they're just too scared to go that next level with me, whereas he's not. I'm scared of Scott seeing me like this though, this look rather heinous. Oh my God the very first time I met him, I was in my bathrobe with a towel on my head and no makeup on so. (knocking) This must be him. God I hope it's him. Hello! How are you? Sorry you've caught me halfway getting ready. (kissing) I missed you. Come in come in come in come in. I missed you. That night I didn't care about anyone else and we just stuck together the whole night. Normally when you go clubbing you're checking out everyone checking to see who's watching you, but I only had eyes for him, it was really weird. Like he'd walk behind me, and he'd say oh they were looking at us. Even though the clubbing was fun and phenomenal, the best part is always getting home and then you get to snuggle. I really enjoyed that. It's bizarre, it's horrible emotions and feelings. I just feel I hope I'm not inadequate for him. I'm in constant fear of him not liking me, which is really bizarre isn't it? - [Justin] Inadequate in what way? - I don't know, 'cause I'm not. I dress up like a girl and stuff, and I act and look like one, I'm, I do, but at the same time, you just always wonder is it good enough? Does it makes sense? Well I never used to think that. - [Justin] Now that she's dating, Ashleigh's desire for surgery is greater than ever, but she still doesn't have the money to fund a full gender reassignment operation. However, Ashleigh has come up with a plan that in the interim, might make her less masculine. - I'm gonna go see Tony, he's a urologist, and we're gonna look at just removing my testicles. I'm having a consultation with him about getting rid of my testicles so I don't produce any more testosterone. - [Justin] And do you think that he'll do it? - I don't see why he won't, he's done it for guys who have cancer. - [Justin] How much would this cost? - I have no idea. We're probably talking thousands, everything costs thousands, so yeah. - [Justin] Is that why you haven't got anything done yet? - No, all my money at the moment is going into my struggling business, so yeah. - I understand that you're interested in having your testicles removed, is that right? - Yeah is that alright? I presume testosterone is my sex drive. - [Tony] Correct. - So without it I won't have a sex drive? - [Tony] You will tend to lose your sex drive, yeah. - But when I'm stimulated, I'll get in the mood, wouldn't I? - Yes you will do. I would want to if I could to see some letter or something from a counselor, psychologist, psychiatrist or something. - Oh yeah, psychological reports and all that. - 'Cause the fear from my point of view is that you might change your mind though. What happens if you change your mind? - No I don't think I'll be changing my mind, there's no fear of that. It's just very degrading being called illness and psychological problem, it's just like, there's nothing wrong with me, I just want to get a vagina, I'm not insane for God sakes. - We're trying to make sure that we're not making a mistake. - Oh no absolutely. - And we don't want to make a mistake on your behalf. - [Justin] So you think you're gonna have to go through the psych analysis? - If I have to I have to, but it's just soul-destroying. I'm affecting no one but myself, so I don't see why I need permission to do things for myself when there are people who can change themselves to look like their favorite cats and get full-body tattoos and implants and it's just, are they saner than I am? (melancholy piano music) He dumped me. He didn't break up with, he dumped me. There's a difference. I said it isn't because you're embarrassed of me? He goes oh hell no, no not at all. It's just the distance and I don't think I'm ready for a relationship. Yeah, 22, I guess he wasn't ready to commit. - [Justin] Ashleigh had hoped that Cafe Narnia would be a place where you could escape the real world. The cafe was also supposed to finance her dream of becoming a woman. But over the next year the harsh reality of business encroaches upon Ashleigh's plans and she loses her cafe. - Selling the cafe was hard. Just trying to get a buyer. - [Woman] Did you make any money out of this? - No, none whatsoever. - We really watched the disintegration of Narnia with her over six months which she just gave up, mentally, she still went every day but totally gave up in her head. She had no idea financially what was happening, and Lindsay and his wife sort of took her aside and said you've got about one more month before we go bankrupt, we need to sell. - [Justin] Did she sell it for not much money? - They sold it for less than they needed, they now have debt to clear. - [Justin] Wow so she's got that debt alone to finance before she can even think about having any surgery or anything. Despite having lost her business, Ashleigh is still dreaming about traveling to Thailand to have gender reassignment surgery. - [Ashleigh] Oh that looks like a hole. - [Justin] It looks real doesn't it? - It does, well I presume. - [Justin] I realized that we've never talked about what the operation actually involved, and I'm curious to find out how much Ashleigh knows. You're hospitalized for about six days, so you need to pay for a hotel for the rest of your time. - Oh I see, 'cause you can't fly obviously. - [Justin] No but also, you can't even go to the toilet afterwards. - Oh my God. - [Justin] And so you have a catheter that has to get changed and cleaned, and then after a few days you can go to the toilet but they want to keep you coming daily for check-ups. - Yeah fair enough. - [Justin] 'Cause you've got stitches that are healing and it's pretty major surgery. (ominous music) - I don't understand a lot of these terms. - [Justin] Well you should do some research. - [Ashleigh] God that's so fascinating, I've never really sat like this and thought about it to such a degree. - [Justin] Like what? - Sort of like, I've accepted being a woman, but I haven't got there yet, if that makes sense. - [Justin] Another one. - I know I'm so anti defining me being transgender, but until I become a woman I'm transgender. And it does define me in so much more of a large way than as little as I'd like to think it does. I think I need to focus on being transgender and admit, okay I'm transgender and this is what I've got to do. You know how I say oh but I'm just a woman now, but really I'm not. I have to admit, I've totally gone about it entirely the wrong way. I'm transgender until I become a woman. Give me this month and see what happens. (jazzy music) (cheering) (kids cheering) - [Ashleigh] Alright, we're coming up to our final guest for the evening and it's Tonya Lewis, yay. - [Justin] Just before Ashleigh sold Narnia, her friends Maria and Brian filmed a chat show at the cafe, which Ashleigh hosted. - Go Ash. - [Justin] Their ultimate goal is to get the program played on regional TV. But six months on, the couple is still editing the show in their spare time even though Ashleigh has since disappeared from their lives. - Wide. We're not part of her life by her choice anymore. I rang her for quite a while and then when she stopped returning my calls, I stopped ringing. - [Justin] So when you watch this, do you miss her? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Like crazy. - How many years have we known each other now? Roughly just throw them out there, oh God I'm ashamed to know it. Do we dare talk about it? - This is beautiful. - Tanya's lesbian experience ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much, yes. - You were very manly back then. You were. - I was exactly like this I swear to God. - She was Graham, back then. - [Ashleigh] The good old times. (water running) - I was just sort of like in the shower one day and I thought, going out I always wondered if I was being judged first on a tranny as opposed to a person, and I don't like that. And then I just thought about it it's like why can't I just be both? Why can't I just be a male's body with a female brain? It's actually accepting that I am a female trapped in a male's body, but being totally accepting of being in a male's body. - [Justin] Were you not comfortable trying to be a woman? - I was, but it always such the effort, because I've got the frame of a male, I had facial hair of a male. If I'd have gotten rid of it all, if I'd had the op, I would always still feel like, am I a convincing female, you know? I don't know if I could've come to terms with that. - [Justin] The morning that Ashleigh realized surgery wasn't an option, he immediately stopped taking the female hormones that he'd been on for over four years and went back to living as a man. - She was successfully accepted as a woman in all of her social circles. But she was still so terribly unhappy, particularly in relationships. So terribly, terribly lonely, and felt like there was no one who would accept her with a penis as a woman. It was such a shock, I ran into her and she said, oh by the way I'm a man. - I'm not distancing myself because I don't like them or anything it's just that I'm not the person who they really probably fell in love with as a friend. - She's in a tough spot, I think socially she's in a tough spot. She has her own identity to sort out. - Yeah maybe. I think if she had the money at the time when she was most excited about it, it would've happened. - Everything in me at the time did want to be a woman. But the way I'm feeling right now I'm glad I've never had the money for it, because I would regret it, I would. - [Justin] So why do you think you were so adamant, so adamant that you were a woman. - I know. - [Justin] That you were gonna do this, you were gonna go through it. - I was so adamant I was a woman because I do have the mind of a woman. And therefore I must be a woman. But as I said, I just came to a realization that's like, but it doesn't mean I have to change in any way to be who I want to be. - [Justin] Here's an idea for you. - Go on. - [Justin] This is something I thought, I wondered if... - 'Cause you've always doubted it, haven't you? Haven't you? I dunno. - [Justin] That you're a woman. - Or that I wanted to do it. - [Justin] I've often doubted that you were gonna go through with it, yes. _ 'Cause I always thought, why aren't I like all those other trannies who were so I hated the, the day it comes off will be the happiest day of my life, and things like that, and I just thought, would it be the happiest day of my life? - [Justin] Could it be that you felt it was more normal or would feel better to be a woman with a man, than a man with a man, and that's where you were going with thinking. - Do I think it would be better to be a woman with a man as opposed to a man with a man? - [Justin] And that's why you wanted to become a woman? - Probably, yeah. 'Cause I wanted men to find me attractive, and I thought the most obvious way is to become female. - [Maria] I'm really worried about her at the moment. I feel like she's really adrift. I feel like she's on a really self-destructive path with the amount of men that she's seeing. (phone beeping) - [Justin] So the men that you're having sex with now, do you think they see you as a gay man? - I don't know, I really don't know, but that doesn't bother me 'cause they're attracted to me, so whatever I'm doing, me being myself is attractive to them. - [Justin] And are they gay? - Um straight, apparently. Bi? No gay. No, no gay. If there was to be a gay, I'd prefer a straight acting male. I don't like effeminate people, I'm not attractive to women or effeminate men. - [Justin] I can't help but have a feeling that there's a degree of internalized homophobia in you. - No not necessarily, no. I don't class myself as a gay male as such, which probably people are saying but no you must be because you're now a boy and you're having sex with boys. It's like well that's fine but I've still got the mind of a female. It's never been a sexuality issue. I've always been attracted to men as a female if that makes sense. - [Justin] Well that's what a lot of gay men might say, too. What are your dreams now? - I don't really have any. - [Justin] Where do you think you'll be in ten year's time? - [Ashleigh] I have no idea, none. - [Justin] Where would you like to be? - I don't know, I don't know. (seagulls calling) - [Justin] It's another six months until I hear from Ashleigh again, but when I do, he's sounding a lot more positive, and looking increasingly masculine. - Now that I'm a little bit further on and stuff it's like whoa, I'm so glad I didn't because I feel like I've gotten back to myself now. Mum was just over the moon, 'cause yes, my baby boy's back. Because it always uncomfortable for mum, because she just didn't understand. Everyone's far more comfortable with me like this. I think it's because they feel like I'm more at ease. People are like, you've done the right thing. Perhaps they're right it's like, yeah I'm glad I didn't go through it all and become a woman because I shudder to think, 'cause once you do it you can't go back and if I made this sort of epiphany afterwards, shit, what was I to do? - [Justin] Ashleigh is back working in a cafe, and is surrounded by a new collection of friends, many of whom identify as gay. - I know isn't it good? Now I realize almost like, it was an alter-ego that I was living every day and that was I think unhealthy. A lot of people don't have this problem of trying to discover themselves or figure out exactly what they are. Well those look like breasts, don't they? He's from the white ghetto. - [Justin] Is there a big difference in the type of men that write to you know? - Ay, no men are men. Pretty much the same. A lot of men use this as like a hookup thing. But then there are sincere people out there but there are a lot of weirdos too. Like I said, I don't like to think of myself as a weirdo, like a lot of people obviously are. - [Justin] Why do you have such a problem with the idea of being gay? - I don't now, now that I realize I'm just an effeminate gay man I suppose, with very large female characteristics. And the more that I am like this, the more I'm actually really able to accept that I'm gay believe it or not. I'm a man who likes men. I was always called she as a little boy growing up and stuff like that, and it just sort of stuck with me I guess. Maybe it confused a little gay boy. - [Justin] Have you had any gay role models in your life when you were growing up, at all? - No, no, I've got gay friends, I wouldn't call them role models, they're just friends. - [Justin] When you were a boy or when you were growing up did you ever know any gay people who are older that could've been a role model. - No, never. - [Justin] Gay people are kind of a little bit invisible in this town aren't they? There's no gay bars and there's no sort of... - No, no, it's very like, or not redneck, it's just very kiwi. But yeah no, I'm just a gay man. - [Justin] Does this surprise you? - Yes, but at the same time, it's just so easy. Have I just taken the longest road round to admit I'm gay?
