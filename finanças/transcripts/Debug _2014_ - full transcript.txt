No! Let's see what you're made of. Please, no! No! Open communications channel. Department of Corrections, this is prisoner transport vessel 5263. Inbound for salvage of freightliner Amphitrite. Please confirm. Roger. Coordinates received. You may proceed with salvage. Ah, Christine! You are sounding as fine as ever. Hey, Capra, they still got you playing hacker nanny? Do me a favor and find out how this ship got added to our tour, will you? Alright, honey. Uh, it looks like some kind of priority recommission. And how does that work? Well, additional missions are covered in section 68 of corrections bylaws. I hate everything about this. It says here you lost a guy? Literally. We never found the body. Ah, that sucks. Work in these tin cans, it's no surprise. Look at this thing. Earth feels very far away right now. It is. Uploading schematics. You look after yourself out there. I'm trying. I'm trying. Let's move it, let's go! I want this bullshit over with. Preaching to the choir, boss. Alright, get out of here and tag in. Come on, you heard the man. Come scan yourselves like good little groceries. Clean up on aisle four! This has got to count as double-time towards release. Nope, standard credit... Dicks! They can't just add missions like this, can they? Do the crime, you do the time. That's original. Got no freighters a million miles from home? I'd say you just have to do the worst tech jobs in the solar system. Alright, tags are up and AV patch is activated. Hey, rookie, ready for your close-up? It's just for records. Nobody ever watches. You're the same security risk as Kaida? How'd they figure that? Standard's good and scrubbed. Ship was left in lockdown, blast shutters and all. We've got to leave her wide open for recommissioning. Alright, you guys know the drill, hook up a connection, clear out the network and delete any rogue programs. No power to main systems, no access to external communications or navigation. You hear me when I say this, you little pricks, I got one guy to answer for already, so no screw-ups this time. No more romantic space walks for Kaida. The guy is dead. It's not funny. The sooner you clear this heap, the sooner we can all say farewell to little miss Kaida. - She's done? - We have another mission thrown at us out of the blue, and it's the one that's sending that walking bitch home? Double check your gear, make sure you've got everything. Sir, I'm supposed to get a call. Must have slipped my mind... Sorry, but it's important. Corrections has rules about that kind of thing, right? You telling me how to do my job? No, I'm just saying that I want a call, that's all. Let it go. Smart girl. I'd listen to her if I were you. But I haven't called home since I got shipped up. Then get over it and gear up. No. I'm not working this ship until I get my call. Son of a bitch! Did you see that Mel? Yes, sir. The little prick tried to take a swing at me. Yes, sir. Self-defense. Kaida. Decided to join us? Missing something? Shit, give me that! You must have dropped it when you were defending yourself. - Kaida, you're in charge. - Sir? What is it? - No disrespect intended, sir, it's just that... - Cut the crap Mel, what do you want? We just feel that given the circumstances, maybe somebody else should be taking care of things. Who is we? All of us. It's just since Oscar's unfortunate accident, we're not comfortable with Kaida being at point. Is that right? I'm not part of this. You weren't there, you don't know what you're talking about. She already got one guy killed. I'm sorry Kaida, but you understand. I'm more than up for the job, Sir. Kaida? Why are you asking me? You're just gonna do what you want anyway. Well, ding-dong the bitch is dead. Mel, you're in charge. Thank you, Sir. Now get out of here, I'm gonna go power up. Alright, let's go. Try not to kill each other while I'm away. HUDs, all. Alright, this is an A class ORCUS freightliner. Looks like she's been out of commission for a while. We are currently at level 0, there are 6 more above us, each with their own control quarters. We're here to clear the network for reprogramming and recommissioning. Once you get to the level I assign you, you'll need to hard wire into the ship's system. Make a connection and use your Heads Up Display to access the network. You delete any corrupted code or rogue programs you find. - There are 8 IDs logged into our HUDs. - What? - Someone else is on the ship? - No, no, that's impossible. It's gone. She's just messing with us. There's only 7 IDs. Now... I know what you're trying to do and it's not going to work. Alright, you and James up top, levels 5 and 6. Fine. Hey! Where do you think you're going? The elevator. Nice try, but we've got limited power. You take the stairs. I fucking hate this job. - I don't like it here. - Really? Because I'm loving it. I'm very sensitive to the energy in my surroundings. And yet not to ridicule? Shut up! Ever since we've arrived here, I have this weird feeling. I feel something too, but it's more like lunch passing. There... - It's a rat. - Kill it. No, it deserves to be here just as much as we do. Get it away from me! - You're such a baby. - It's disgusting! No, it's not. He's just a smart little fellow who wants to say hi, aren't you? Oh, shit! No, no! Oh my God! Your face! It was priceless! You are such a bitch! Yeah, she is, but you... scream like one. Damn it, Lara, you shouldn't do things like that. I could not let an opportunity like that pass me by. Come on people, we have got a network to clear. Alright, this is me. Gee, don't put yourself out or anything. I won't. Lara, you're on 2. Samson, you're on 3. Di, Di, you're heading up to 4. Keeping me close? Well, you're going to need your cutters. The access panel is all welded shut. Why would someone go to all that trouble? - To keep us out. - Or keep us in. Schematics here. This place has eyes. So? They all do. HUDs on. Holy crap! This is insane. There's cameras everywhere. Overkill for a hauling freighter. - Depends on what it's hauling. - We'll disable the cameras once we have access. What's wrong, Kaida? You shy? I prefer to watch. Lara? What do you need? Did you get my message? What is this thing? Just keep your eye on it. You bastard! HUD, check active processes. Something is running on the network. It must be hardwired. It's got full system access. Mel, did you get that? There shouldn't be. Some kind of crosstalk or signal link maybe? Capra, hold off on power. What? - Kaida, that's not your call! - Until we know what's running. Well, I'm here now. I told you there was something wrong with this place. Do you want power or not? We should wait. The sooner we get that power, the better, Capra. Sir. Yes, yes, keep your pants on. Okay, here it comes. It's alive. Meet me back at the shuttle when you're done. Comforting... HUD. Trace. I'm sorry, database systems are currently updating. Please stand by. You've been saying that for quite some time, I imagine. It won't be more than a moment. Thank you for your patience. - Goodbye. - There's a lot of rogue programs to shut down. The system is riddled with them. Sweet! Time for some fun. - With what? - The rogues. Over time some of them lose the thread. - They don't know they're just programs. - That doesn't worry you? No. Get them talking, give them some hope, then erase them line by line. It's like tearing the wings of flies. We're getting away with murder. Isn't that right, Kaida? Leave her alone. Kaida! I'm heading in, okay? It's a pleasure working with you too. What are you doing? Your call.... The communications terminal? It's restricted. You're welcome. - Jam Jam! You're here! - Were you wicked, Nicholas? No, I'm not wicked. I'm a good boy. - I know you are, Nick Nack! - Are you here? No... Nicky, Nicholas, something came up. It's work... - Did you go to jail? - What? Dad said you were bad. That you are a criminal and they threw your ass in jail. You will not be with us, he said. - Did he? - I am very angry with you. I'm gonna make it up to you, okay? Promise. He's my little brother. On screen. I can't get into the airlock! - What? So how do we get back to the shuttle? - Mel! I'm on it, sir. The generator is still producing power, but it's all being routed through some kind of background process. HUD, initiate power trace. - Come on, how long? - I'll get back to you in just a second. - Can we blow the door? - If we all want to die... We breach the hull or the shuttle, and everyone goes home a popsicle. Come on guys. What are we missing? Inititiate system maintenance. Overrides are waiting. Where did you get an override code? I asked nicely. What kind of rogue would be able to lock us out of our own ship? Kaida, little dragon. Identify process. It may be a security system. How do you figure? It's talking to me right now. But why is he talking to you? Open processor window. Shit. Tell me what I'm looking at? It's bioware. Of course, the power is going to the incubation process. What's it incubating? We're human with a bit of tech. This thing... is tech with a bit of human. What are you up to? I think I just pissed it off. Or why don't you use one of your fancy overrides? Why don't you check your HUD, Mel? I can't. It's self-contained, and it's in everything. This shouldn't be active, should it? It's fine, some idiot must have left it running during decommission. What was this ship hauling? I don't know. What does it matter? - Bioware is military-grade technology. - So? She's right, Yeah, well, Kaida's not in charge, I am. Mel... Private line. - What is it, what? - We should mayday now. - While we can. - My first time on point and I bail? You'd like that, wouldn't you? No. Resume open channel. Alright everybody, we're sticking to the plan. Clear the system, find whatever security program is causing the lockdown and kill it. Somebody tell me what's going on. Are we good? My apologies Sir, we're all good. Oh, great. So I'm stuck out here waiting for you assholes to kill this thing... before I can get back to my shuttle. - It looks that way, yes. - Then shut up and get it done! Mel... Are you sure about this? Kaida, what do you think? Get back to work, all of you. I've got this under control. Kaida. Kaida? No... Oscar? What did you just say? You saw Oscar? No. There. See? Power is back on. Let us know if you see any more dead people, Kaida. Alright, let's these systems cleared and get out of here. Please state the nature of your pharmaceutical needs. See if that gets your attention. It's like Christmas. Are you crazy? Yep, for you! But don't worry, it's not like they can see what I'm doing. The system logs everything. - All the more reason that you should just come to see me. - I told you we have to be discreet. You know how they can be about this sort of thing. We can always use precautions, you know that. You need to be a lot more careful. Please put your arm in the designated receptacle to receive treatment. Alright, treat me baby. You may feel pressure and some minor discomfort of this phase of the dispensary process. Why don't you show me your titties while you are at it, huh? Snug. - Right now there is not much to be careful about, is there? - Do you think I like this? I'm just saying. Lara? Dispensing... Lara. Shit! Capra, Sir? Oh, come on! Anybody? Can anybody hear me? - That's better. - Shit. I shut down communications access. Well, thanks for nothing. Run program ID. Any processes that you are attempting now, are just about impossible. Aren't you clever. I'm designed to be. Too clever maybe. I don't think so. Then why are you still running? I'm responsible for the people incarcerated on this vessel. Incarcerated? Does this freighter hold a prison ship? Amphitrite is a prison ship. No prisoners. You are here. Not for long. Your attacks on my network have to stop. Prison ships were abolished decades ago. No one told me that. Release the shuttle, and the communications, and we'll leave. I understand. I just want us all to get out of here safely. That'll be difficult. How's that? I'm not gonna let you leave. Then we're not gonna get along very well. - Comfortable, you junkie prick? - Stop! Please! What is this? What I do. God! It hurts. I understand that. What? Why? I have always done this. I don't want to die. Each one of you are made up of many tiny pieces. But now you are tiny pieces of me. I don't understand. I'll show you. I need you to see your friends like I do. The next course of psychotropics may prove to be very unsettling. HUD on screen. Bank accounts, credit cards, let's see what we've got before we start clearing everything. Run. Access denied. You do not have clearance for the requested files. Oh, no? How about now? - What was that? - A pull and winch. You gonna let me in, or what? You are the property of Corrections. You are not allowed on this network. Then I guess you're no use to me. Stop. I have the information you seek. I know you do, but you don't seem to wanna give it up. - I will remain active? - Depends what you've got to tell me. A member of the maintenance staff flashed bank and credit accounts... onto an isolated data cube when their owner's records... - were released from the system. - Released? Died, you mean. The janitor cleaned them up and then cleaned them out! How much are we talking? 512 dormant bank and credit accounts are fully archived onto the cube. The totals will depend on interest accrued. Where is it now? I will remain active? Send them to me. - We'll work something out. - Uploading... One more question... Does this hurt? There are no closets to cower in here, you little bitch! I will find you. Just as your mother did. Environmental assessments are not available to your clearance level. It seems a shame to delete such a pretty bloke. I am recording this conversation and will report you directly to security. Oh, my God! Squeal piggy! Hi, Jam Jam! - Nicholas? - They threw your ass in jail. - What? - You're a criminal. Criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal! What is this? You are a criminal! - Criminal, criminal! - Not funny, assholes! Good riddance! Good riddance! - Jail and a criminal! - Turn it off! - Stop! - Criminal! Criminal, criminal! Criminal, criminal! Bye, Jam Jam! Bye, Jam Jam! Bye, Jam Jam! Bye, Jam Jam! Bye, Jam Jam! - That was you? - No! - Turn it off! - Whoa! It's not me! - Anyone else seeing this? - I don't know. Touch me again, and I'll kill you. Okay, let go. The only way to access this feed would be communications capture. So who? You mean what. Hey, beautiful. What happened to you? We were locked out of communications. Yes, I noticed that. But here you are talking to me. When there's a will, there's a way. So, what now? Your body. My hands. My mouth. My lips, my tongue. Wow! Conjugal sin. Seriously? Sensory baths on every level. There is nothing in the rules about virtual fraternization. Virt could be a nice change. Yeah. I thought you'd like that. I do, but shouldn't we be working? Don't make me start without you. We should get locked on big, creepy ships more often. Not a sewage pipe. This better make me stinking rich. HUD. It was on him? Shit! This surely better work! Let's start isolating threads, we'll try and suffocate it. I can't. Just do it! You don't understand. It was Nicholas. It wasn't me who did all the hacking. Your brother? But he's a... What? A retard? A kid. He practically speaks machine code. What did he do? He hit Bovine Industries... city blocks of living, breathing, constantly harvested beef. They're not great. It feeds a lot of people. Yeah, well, Nicholas got in and started cow-tipping. Rivers of shit, literally. He took out the whole plant. Eventually they figured out where the attack was coming from. They would have charged him with terrorism. But they took you instead. I was in my last year in the academy. And I was good. The admiral said I would get my own ship one day. What was I supposed to do? Nicolas wouldn't have been able to survive a place like this. But you will. What are we gonna get up to in here? Welcome to Real Feels Revolutionary Immersive Sensory System. This is so crazy. Your partner has already initiated their session. To begin, please remove your clothing and enter the chamber. Thank you. Come on! I've made it this far. Money can't save you like I can. How did you get into this HUD? With me, all things are possible. You. You're the security protocol. You're in charge? Well, there's Capra, but, yes. Capra has become unreliable. Who do you think you are? I am. I always have been. Release the shuttle. In time... What is the point of keeping us here? It's what one does with criminals. Your sentence began upon entry to this vessel. This ship was assigned to us... You are holding us against our will... ...when we're just doing the work Corrections gave us in the first place. You requested this ship. No. No. This was a last minute addition, some kind of... President's override. You have all been deceived. What is this? Look at the game she plays. Kaida. She put your crew's lives in danger. She had Capra's key card... She added the work order. To get home faster... They'll reset her time served. She's completely back at square one with Corrections. Surely, no reprimand can be too harsh. Meaning what? Once order has been restored, I shall release the shuttles communications to your discretion. This isn't my responsibility. Where the hell is Capra? Come to daddy. Here. Process this, you son of a bitch. You can't beat me. I am everyone ever confined in this floating prison. I am legions of treacherous liars, rapists and murderers. All schooled by a trusty hate and fear. What happened here? Inmates breached a section cabling and created a short. I ordered them to stand down. They refused. They died? So many souls screaming for salvation. Begging to enter my world. The moment of death... is the purest state of life. Flatline scan. In those last desperate moments, tags become extremely vulnerable. Our tags are protected. He can't access information like that, can he? It's not impossible. They are part of me now, and I am a part of them. In the end I will crack you open and make you play our every possible moment. What? Holy shit! Capra? Capra, Sir? Hello? Diondra? If that's you dicking around, I'll flush your pot, I swear. Mel? I don't understand. What is this? Oh, shit! I've got you now, fleabag. Who do you think you're messing with? Infrared! Goodbye, Samson. And hello. End program. But you just got here. Listen to them. They sound more like rabid dogs than men. You'll meet them all eventually, of course. No! First, let's see what you're made of. How could he have done that? Time to meet the rest of your kind. No, please! No! No! No! Diondra! Diondra. We need to get out of here! Where is she? You check down there. I'll meet you back here. You have the seniority you wanted. I shouldn't even be here. I don't deserve any of this. I was just pointing out weaknesses in their defenses. I just wanted the military to understand how vulnerable their systems are. The laws. They must be upheld. They just need to make an example of me. - With the others taken into custody after your arraignment? - What do you mean? There are records. What do you think that you know? You did what you had to. You protected yourself. I was the first one that they picked up. I didn't tell the military anything that they did not already know. Others can acquire the information. Like who? You are surrounded by people with the necessary skills. You mean Kaida. What did she find? Nothing. As long as she remains here. Diondra. Diondra! It's okay, just... Breathe! Oh, come on. Come on, just... Just try... Diondra! Capra, help us! James! Hey! - It's Capra. He's killed Diondra. - What? He's out there now. This-- is all your fault. You hacked our work assignments. She's the reason we're here. She's tacked another ship onto our mission, this ship. We're here because Kaida wanted to go home early. That does not matter now. - I think it does. - We need to get back to the shuttle. I talked to him. Who? I reached an agreement with the security system. He's gonna release the shuttle to me. It's not gonna let you go. He has no quarrel with us. You, on the other hand... We're going together. All of us! Still picking the wrong side, huh, kid? I am. Let's do this! Lara? Lara! Lara? No. No, Lara? Can you walk? Mel is headed for the shuttle. Not without us, he isn't. We had an agreement! The shuttle. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! We're stuck here. Not yet, we're not. External systems. Remote manipulator controls. On screen. Where is it? There! Can you reach it? Got it! If I can get it back into another docking bay. What's happening? I don't know. The controls aren't responding. That's it. He's won. Was I worth it? Was I worth dying for? You bastard! I am a fortress under a canopy of stars. I cannot be breached. I will stop this. Pride is the root of all sins. He gave us the devil himself. Save us the sermon. I will enjoy having you join me. Don't get your hopes up. Everything is hackable. Initiate vocal clearance. Do good and forget. What's that? My mother used to say... Do bad and remember, do good and forget. If it wants me, it can have me. What are you doing? My code shuts down the security processes, so we can destroy the Bioware. - You're uploading your tag? - Plus some code of my own. It's not a flatline. But she'll be rogue, and she'll have teeth! There's only one of her. This thing has got demons running throughout the system. 7 control processes. But the key is the bioware! - If we don't get to that, it will just keep respawning. - It only takes one of them to... At least she's got a shot. It's more than what we've got out here. Extraordinary! I have so missed the unexpected. - I'm good. - No. No, you're not. 18% blood loss. That's quite an injury. I'm so sorry. You have nothing to apologize about. End process. What a fascinating construct. I can't wait to add the rest of you. One down, five to go. You don't mess around. Either of you. Is it true? That we weren't even supposed to be here? The ship was scheduled for clearing. I didn't see any harm. You sure know how to pick 'em. I couldn't stand it anymore. We weren't exactly a welcoming bunch. The others didn't know. What's to know? What it felt like to kill him. Oscar. The shuttle couldn't pressurize with him out there. I made a decision. I didn't have a choice. He knew that. He must've. I shouldn't have asked. I loved his eyes, but when I cut the tether, all I remember in them is betrayal, blame, stars... Don't. Stars! A "canopy of stars." Oh, my God! I know where it is. Schematics on screen. - Attached to the other hulls. - There's some under Engineering. Course, the power conduits will be too vulnerable. Level zero. No, no, no. You'll just slow me down. - I can do it. - No. No, you can't. Just stay here. He'll block my HUD. Use the radio. I need you to monitor her progress for me. The one shot... If she fails... Nothing we do out here is gonna save us. Hurry! Or you'll be celebrating alone. Oh! Well done, little dragon. Yes! You have one process... I have many. I have been on worse odds. You think you can stop me. You can't. People think it's the sudden cold that finishes you. Death freezes the human body instantly. That's not how it kills you. The human body exposed to the vacuum of space is subjected to all sorts of terrible things. UV radiation, which burns the skin to ashes. High energy particles tear your very molecules apart. With all of that... it takes time... Pressure... that's the killer. The body enlarges to almost double its normal size. The force punctures your eardrums, bursts your lungs. They say you can exhale, but... how much time will that buy you? Do you think Oscar had time to exhale? His skin cracked and curled in the UV-rays. It must been the stuff of nightmares. Okay. Opening radio communication. James. Can you hear me? James? James! Yeah, I hear you. I've started the EVA. What's the status of my rogue? This little piggy went to market. This little piggy stayed home. This little piggy had roast beef. And this little piggy had none. There's something wrong. The rogue is in trouble. Are you alright? Are you alright? I'm at the bioware haven... but I won't be able to get through its defenses unless she kills his processes. I can't tell what's going on. Her readings are really low. Security could be spiking all over the place. You know how this ends. There's a force field protecting the bioware. There you are. Oh, no! Kaida! Oh, my God! Murder... It makes me feel so human. Let's see what you're made of. You owe me, bitch! Trouble catching your breath? Now you know how it feels. I am... a little piece of you. No. No! That's not fair! Flatline scan. Initiate emergency call. Sir? She's beautiful, isn't she? She's a classic, Sir. Are we ready to take her out? Ready when you are. How many passengers do we have? 1,200 of the richest most privileged sons of bitches that have ever lived. We'd better not keep them waiting then. Amphitrite, open her up, please. Welcome to the Amphitrite, gentlemen. Propulsion initiated. Pre-flight check complete. Life Support at 100 percent. Emergency backups checked, cleared and ready. Supply complete. Running itinerary, 17-day scenic tour of the outer solar system. 1,200 passengers, 120 crew.
