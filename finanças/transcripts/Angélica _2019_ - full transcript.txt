SUPPORTED BY INCAA AJIMOLIDO FILMS, BAL MECENAZGO OF THE CITY OF BUENOS AIRES, CUBIC POST AND INCAA PRESENT ANG*LICA STARRING CECILIA RAINERO AS ANGÉLICA DIRECTED BY DELFINA CASTAGNINO Hello... Angélica? Ángel! Turn off the light. Come here. Come on. You seem to be in a hurry. I'm not in a hurry. What are you wearing? Come here. Yes! This is nice. Yes. Do you like baby girls? -Ari... -What? Do you like baby girls now? You scare me, Angélica. I asked you for a break and you went with Arrieta? -Why did you call me? -To fuck. Can you pass me my T-shirt? Ariel, are you going to that birthday party? What birthday party? The one of your ex-girlfriend. You're my ex-girlfriend. Hello, I'm Antonia. Leave a message or do whatever you want. Antonia? Can you hear me, Antonia? It's Zulema Conde from the senior center. I know you haven't come for a long time. Anyway, I want to remind you about the payment. And I want to tell you that on the 10th of this month, the annual canasta competition will take place. There will be poker rounds and our traditional buffet. I know you took part last year and got good results. We hope you will come, like every year, next Monday from 4 p.m. on. Bye. Mom... Mom... Mom! Answer me! I'm sure you're watching the soap opera on full volume. I asked you not to call Ariel. How do I have to tell you that? He told me you called him four times and now you're not answering me. What do you want? Are you OK? Call me. I won't relax until you call-- Why did you run away? Why are they asking me to take you downstairs, to the cell? Why don't you stay there for a week? You can use the smallest louse in there as a pillow. They say they bring you here to rectify you. That's a lie! When I arrived, the first thing three of them did was beating me up. What about Mimoso? They destroyed him. -Who is Mimoso? -He's a guy. He's in the infirmary now. What did they do to him? You should ask him. Tell me, what did they do to him? No, you should ask him yourself. That's what it's about, Fernández. It must never happen again. Tell me. Don't you want to help? I don't care about helping. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY FAVORITE COUSIN The only thing I want is to get out of here, to be free. I don't want to be in here. WE'LL CELEBRATE THIS SATURDAY, COME WITH A COSTUME. ARIAS 2020 Who can be free? Those who are wealthy? Those who behave properly can be free. What's that exactly? The only thing I remember from my childhood is being beaten. It's easy to behave properly when you have a father, when people treat you well, when you have money... Hi, Jose. How are you? I'm fine. I wanted to ask you something, do you know if Ariel is seeing someone? I used to laugh all the time. All I do now is yell. He's your friend, maybe he told you something. I can deal with it. No, I'm OK. Do you want to go to a costume party tomorrow? A stupid girl, it doesn't matter. They can all go to hell. Yes, let's talk about the move tomorrow. Bye, kisses. Hi? Yes, doctor. "Come with a costume." Ángel, Ángel... I'll take our aunt's glasses. I won't take mom's bed because my car is full now. They'll take the packed things that are downstairs. Aren't you interested in any of those things? Angélica... What? No, I don't want anything. Come on, turn that off, Angélica. -Did you check the attic? -No... Yes. -Yes or no? -Yes, there's nothing there. What about these things? The bed, the TV... I want to buy new things. The things I want are in Josefina's house. I'm fine, take your things. I already took everything ten years ago. OK. You're taking our aunt's glasses, mom's bed, the Cuban vase... I don't think you took everything ten years ago. -But do you want any of those things? -No, I don't want anything. -Because I already asked you. -Yes. -And you told me I could. -OK. -I don't know why you're saying that. -Don't be annoying, Amalia. It'll be good for you to leave this house. It's what mom would have wanted. I don't know, maybe it's not. She hated this house. She hated everything, Amalia. She showed love like that. -Hi, I'll put it here. -OK. Go straight ahead and I'll tell you what to do. -Give me the keys. -What? -The keys of the house. -Why? I'll give them to the architect. Come on, Angélica. I'll give them to her. -Will you throw a birthday party? -What birthday? Your birthday, it's next week. One shouldn't celebrate forty years old. Did mom say that to you? -No, I say that. -Call me. OK, bye. Straight ahead. Hi, Jose. Yes, I'm fine. I'm not going to your house in the end. Thank you, but I'm not. No, it has nothing to do with you. No, don't worry. My asshole sister booked me a room in her sister-in-law's hotel. It has a pool, I'll stay there for a few days. They'll spoil me and water cheers me up. Turn left, please. Yes. Yes, she didn't ask me before booking it. But it's great... Yes, she's a bit intense. And yes, a bit bitchy, too. She does that to look after me. It's how she is. Stop it, she's my sister, you can't say those things about her. I'm saying it in a funny way, you're saying it hatefully. Am I out of place? You're out of place, stop it. I can't have this conversation right now, Josefina. I'll hang up. I'll... -Turn left again. -OK. Turn left again. Did you forget anything? We'll keep playing, friends. Pay attention. What's the capital city of Denmark? Time! -Copenhagen. -Right! An easy one: How many legs does a spider have? Eight. How do you say "overwork death" in Japanese? Options? How do you say "overwork death" in Japanese? I need options. Karaoke, karoshi or inemuri? Time! -Inemuri. -Inemuri. So sorry. It's karoshi. Hi there! -Are you here for the party? -Yes. -Do you know her? -No, I don't. I love it! Let's go! Excuse me. Move. Ariel? Sorry... Excuse me. Give me the vodka. -Are you drinking anything? -Yes. -Give me the vodka, give me a bit more. -Stop! What are you looking for? I want to make myself a Cuba Libre. What are you? I'm a Minion. I see. -Do you know what it is? -No, I don't have a clue. What are you dressed up as? I'm dressed up as my mom. You don't know her either, so we're even. You have a nice smile, Minion. Thanks. I have whisky if you want. It's OK, it's for my girlfriend. It's good for you to mention her. So you can relax, I won't harass you. I have a boyfriend too, I was just offering you whisky. It's OK. I was just being nice. Yes, it's OK. See you. Yes... Sure. Come here! I have to think them well. Ask for three wishes, but don't say anything. -Come on! -OK! -Watch out! Her hair! -Throw water to her! Hello. Sir, are you feeling well? Sir? Excuse me... I'm on the floor because I have a contracture in my back. A contracture... Let's see. I'm going to fix it. I beg your pardon... Take off that device, turn around and put your face against the floor. But... Don't worry, turn around. That's right. -Like this? -Move this way. OK. Take a deep breath. One, two and... I'm sorry, do you know what you're doing? Don't speak, just relax and enjoy. OK. There's a burning smell. Do you smell it? It's me. My hair got on fire with the candles just now. With the candles? I'm an awful father. Blowing out candles is always the same. It seems emotive, but it's pointless. In your case, there was a fire outbreak. That must have been funny. Where did you meet Violeta? Who? My daughter. Right, Viole. We took a poetry course together. I didn't know she likes writing. You never really get to know someone. What about you? What do you do, sir? You don't have to be that formal. What do you do? I'm an actor, but I've been retired for a long time. What's your name? Alfonso. You're too young. I don't think you remember me. I worked mostly in movies. As a gallant. Is that you in the picture? Yes. Do the photos remind you of anything? Not really. Alfonso... Are you looking at my panties? Of course not. Needless to say, I'd never do that. And do you want to look at my panties? Well... I'd really like it. Well, look at it. Your underwear is very nice. Needless to say, thank you. OK... I think you'll be fine. I don't feel the pain anymore... Alfonso Arrieta. Really. Thank you. Wait! I don't know your name. Angélica. -Who is it? -It's me, the Parrot. Come in. What are you doing here? -Did you run away? -No, they let me go. -Don't mess with me. -I swear it. -My mother is dying. -Mrs. Mercedes? How awful. I haven't seen her or Ana for a while. The police don't even let me sunbathe. She's dying and I can't afford her medicine. Tomorrow, we'll come with the van so we can take all the stuff. The lady said it's all packed. It must be upstairs. On Monday, we'll bring the tools and start. Everything's wet, so we have to be careful. There's one here, do you see? There's nothing here. We'll put everything that's useful on the sides. From this room... Well... The floors, this wardrobe, the windows... How much time do you think it'll take? Two or three days. Can I take the bed? What bed? Take it. If you want the stove, take it, too. I'll take the TV later. OK. We could also use the floor of the stairs. We'll do it at the end. Bye, guys. Listen to me. Remember to order the dump truck and the pneumatic drill. OK. Motherfucker! Come on! Come on! Good afternoon, what's your name? -I'm replacing Antonia. -Antonia. Table eight. You'll play in the same table we're playing. Antonia owes us six payments. Excuse me. She was fed up. She couldn't tolerate anymore the mistreatment of that... asshole. He was lying on the bed in his underwear watching TV. Perhaps, he had just farted. She approached him carrying the insecticide spray and told him: "Darling, cover your face with the sheets because I'll use insecticide." She left the insecticide spray, grabbed a mace and smashed his head with it. Is it true? He got a blow on his head. You should learn from the lady of the story, Belma. When you want something, you have to go for it, don't wait for it to come to you. Are you saying I have to kill him? No, stupid, you have to fuck him. Elvira! So I have to call him and say: "Fuck me, Silvio." I'm sorry, Belma, but don't be stupid. In what you're saying, he's the subject. You're saying: "Fuck me," but you should say: "I'll fuck you." "I'll fuck you, Silvio. Remove your dentures." I wish I had someone like Silvio just for a while. Don't complain, Raquel, you never go out. I'm not ready yet. I still think of Eduardo a lot. But he died seven years ago. You can think about other things apart from Eduardo. I understand you, Raquel. I'm also a widow. You're so young, dear. How long? Ten years. When he died, how old were you? Thirty. So young. Did you have children? Two girls. They were young when Alfredo died. My useless younger daughter still lives with me. I don't know how to get rid of her. When she leaves, you'll miss her. Do you think so? Anyway, I don't tell her anything because I need her, but I think she knows that. My older daughter is a dumb, but she's different. I experienced the same as you, especially the first years. I didn't want to fuck anyone because nobody was going to be like Alfredo. The Indians burn dead people's possessions because they think the spirit remains there. And we should set it free. For example, he gave this dress to me. Well, you should burn that dress or, at least, you should give it. OK. At some point, I'll have to get rid of his ashes and fuck again. -God hears you! -No! Did you see what she did? We were moved and distracted by her story and, then, she won. You fooled us! I screwed you up. And she started today. Motherfucker! Can anyone open the door? I can't open the door. It's stuck. Can anyone open the door? What were they thinking? Aldo? Is that you? Aldo? Aldo? I'm the owner. Can you open the door? It's stuck. Can you hear me? I can't fucking believe it! They made me come here for nothing! Hello, hello. Hello. Hello, Amalia. I'm fine, you? Thank you, is it today? Right, it was yesterday. It's not that I don't remember it, that's something I don't think about. I told you I don't have to celebrate after 40s. What? I'm going to throw a party. What? What happened? Why couldn't you come in? Wait a minute. Don't talk or turn to anyone. Wait a minute. Can you tell me first why you went to the house? They already took everything. The bed... Well... You know what? I also want the bed. No, I didn't decide. You did. Well, If I did, I changed my mind. Well... Listen... Amalia... Listen to me. Come on. Yes... Listen to me, Amalia, I'll go to the house with you. I'll go with you. Come on, let's go and enter together. Yes, I'll help you dismantle the bed so that you can take it. Because I'd prefer you to keep the bed instead of listening to you. OK. Do you want to go today? No, don't tell Pablo about it. Don't call your man. Both of us can do it. How about at 3 p.m.? OK, let's meet here. Well, I mean there in the house. Yes. OK, see you at 3 p.m. Bye! Alfonso Arrieta... Ángel? We said at 3 p.m. I called you like five times and you didn't answer me. Late happy birthday. Thank you. I can't believe it. Nobody's given me anything for seven years. Is this the one you were knitting for mom? Yes, but she can't wear it now, so... -It's for the winter. -Thanks. Yes, it's a bit early in the year. Give me the keys. Why don't we ring the bell before? -To let them know... -Them who? I don't know, whoever it is living there! I heard noises the other day. What's that, Amalia? -Pepper spray, just in case. -Put that away. We should call the police or anybody. Stop with that. -Let's play "tunnel." -What? "Tunnel." "Tunnel"? Are you crazy? I haven't done it since I was ten years old. That's a lie. The last time was when you were 22. You and your obsession with remembering stupid things. I'll do it. Follow me if you want. Angélica, are you crazy? Stop calling me crazy. You don't even know what's inside or what you're going to find. Come and bring the pepper spray. Yes, if you go, I have no choice. I can't believe it. -Are you OK? -Yes, come on, it's OK. Coward! Coward... Look what you make me do. Wait. I'll take my time. Come on! Don't worry, jump! Look at this... Fucker. This one... Wait, let's see. No. No. I can't. This is too high. No, the nail's just bent. Wait, I have to grab this. Let me do it. That's how it's done! You're breaking everything. I'm glad you take it. So you can use it with... What's his name? Pablo. -With Pablo. -OK, come on. Leave it here. It'd be easier. And your children will use it in the future. So it will be kept in the family for generation after generation. Grab it from there. But if I take it, they'll bury me with the bed like they did with mom. Don't be dramatic, Angélica. You can buy the bed you want with the money. The bed I want? I don't want a bed. What are you going to do with all that money? You can do whatever you want. What are you going to do? I think I'll take a sabbatical. One-year trip. One-year trip? To where? I don't know. -To Japan. -To Japan? Are you serious? You never go anywhere, but you'll go to Japan? Where do you want me to go? To Punta del Este, Miami? No, I'm not saying that. But you can buy something more solid or stable. An apartment, for example. I got it, Amalia. Well, I want to take care of you. Taking care of me? Who the hell are you to take care of me? Calm down! I'm being nice to you. I almost always dreamed about mom when I slept in this bed. If I dream about mom two nights in a row, I'll set fire to it. And what are you going to do with the money? I'll extend my house in the gated community. I'll have a guest room built and I'll put this bed there. -Won't you use it? -Yes, I will. But you said you'd put it in a guest room. If I had known you were going to use this bed for guests, I'd have kept it. Oh my God, Angélica, I'm getting tired. Do you want the bed? Take it! -No, you take it. -OK. Can you help me? Stop it. You'll break it. You'll break it. OK... Well, hold it. OK. Fuck! Are you going to Josefina's? Can I give you a lift? No, I'll go for a walk. -Are you sure? -Yes. Hand me the screws of the bed. -Here they are. -Let's be in touch. OK, bye. A, I LOVE YOU, I HATE YOU What happened? Are you OK? Are you in pain? -Can you stand up right? -Yes, I'm fine. OK. -Are you sure? -Yes, don't worry. -Have you never ice-skated? Really? -No. Never. It doesn't seem to be the case. You're a beginner, but you're good at it. -Not even with regular skates? -No. -Is it your first time? -No. I've come many times. I've come with my daughter, but when you're old, it's more difficult to learn. You couldn't be too old. Yes, when Violeta was born, I looked like her grandfather. What relationship do we seem to have? I don't know. -Your boyfriend? -I guess not. -Your father? -Maybe. Perhaps, you're just a sweet old man who I took for a walk. WINTER YOUR ICE RINK Hi! I called a while ago to ask for a song and you didn't play it. "Cheek to cheek." Yes, Sinatra's version. You didn't play it. OK, but I want you to know that I'd like to dedicate this song to my mother. And she's dead if you know what I mean. I'm just asking for a little respect. Thanks. "Cheek to Cheek." If you don't have that version, play another one. OK, I'll be waiting. -What did you do in Japan? -It's delicious. -I went to work. -Thanks. I went there to work. You should be careful with work matters in Japan. Why? They're very hard-working people. They even have a word for "overwork death." -Karoshi. -Yes. I was careful not to become infected with that. -Really? -Really. Luckily, I'm quite lazy. I'm having it remodeled. -OK. -Yes. They say it'll take 3 months, but it'll be more. I guess it'll take 6 months. And... You're living here until they finish that, right? No, yes... I come and go. I like your haircut. It's uneven, but you look good. I'm still trying it. You're lovely. Well... you're embarrassing me. And you? What about me? How do you spend your time? Nowadays... I don't know. What a great answer. What happens? Did my question upset you? No... Actually, I was taking care of my mother until she died. That's what this is about. I'm sorry, Angélica. Don't be sorry. They say it was for the best. I don't know. I'm wondering about it. Yes. The same happened to me. Well, no... It wasn't the same because... each situation is different. But why? What happened? My wife died ten years ago. Yes, and... I still... I still feel the same things I felt then. You have a sad look. Yes, right? It's true. We talked about death a lot, did we? It was my fault. I began to talk about the Japanese language. It's OK. I just... I don't know how we get out of this. Like this. TUNA Did you finish, guys? Yes, we'll leave in a minute. Your bag is in the kitchen. See you. Bye. How nice. Angélica? Angélica? I talked to the construction company and they said somebody's living here. I called Josefina and she said you never showed up. What the hell is going on here? I know you're here. Angélica? I LOVE YOU, I HATE YOU Don't be stupid. Angélica! Ángel, please. Ángel? No... Ángel! Please, come out! Come on! Ángel. Please, Ángel. You fucking freaked me out, fool! -Put that down, please. -You have to call me before coming. I'm sorry. I called you... It's being remodeled. It's a mess. That's why, Angélica, come with me to mine. At least, for a few days. -Please, stop pointing that at me. -Don't move. I warn you. Listen to me, dear. I don't care what happened. I don't care what you did either. Please, come with me. I won't leave this place. What's your fucking problem, asshole? You shot me, you idiot! You know what? You're on your own. TO OBVIA AND OTTO
