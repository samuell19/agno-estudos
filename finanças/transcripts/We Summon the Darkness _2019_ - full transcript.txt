You're so lying. What? Turn the music down, I can't hear you. I said you're so lying. No, I'm not. I've read an article about it. When you're attracted to someone, your pupils dilate, which makes your eyes look bigger, so it looks like you're, like, more attractive. I don't know about you, but I fuck with my eyes closed. Fight me, Val. - Where? - It's actually interesting. What magazine did you read this in? I read it in Bop. Oh, she read it in Bop, the preferred periodical of intellectuals everywhere. Stop! Just let me tell you this. It goes back to, like, tribes in Africa and how they would attract their mates. They'd paint their cheeks red and their lips red, and accent their eyes, all just sort of play with the men's subconscious to make them think that they were turned on. Hold on. You're telling me that Bop is saying that makeup is, like, war paint? - For sex? - Yeah. That's the whole point of makeup. It's, like, ridiculous. I'm gonna be honest, I haven't showered in two full days, - so I need to... - That is truly disgusting. It's actually better if you haven't showered. We're gonna get sweaty anyway, everybody looks great. You know, it's fine. You're gonna fit right in. How long until we stop? Because I really have to pee again. What? You just peed 60 miles ago. That was less than an hour. I have a weak bladder, Alexis. Just pull over and I'll pop a squat. No. I'm not stopping. You can hold it. I can't hold it. Well, stop drinking so much soda. We have a schedule. My dad never pulled over for us. He used to make my brother pee in a pickle jar. What? What was going on in your family? Do you guys wanna hear what my dad did? No. No. I can't go there right now. You guys are losers. Cooler than you. - In another life, bitch. - Oh, not to be alarming, but there are no more Ding Dongs. Zero, zilch, nada, none. Okay, fine. We'll stop at the next gas station. Oh! Thank you, God. But if you aren't back by the time the Twinkies are in the car, we're leaving without you. - I get the front seat. - That's right. Stop. There is a scourge on our society, my brothers and sisters. The evil that is heavy metal rock music is resolute, steadfast, and unwavering, in its goal to corrupt our children's souls. Now, I know what you all are thinking. "Oh, but, Pastor Butler, it's just music, it's just..." Boo! Damn, Bev. Spooked much? This is supposed to scare other people, not us. I guess. ...means that they will come to you in sheep's clothing... Getting this. ...but inwardly, they are ferocious as wolves. Hi. Just wanna get this. And then... And the gas. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, my God. - And these. - Seriously? Why? Where's your Fourth of July spirit? Whatever. 25.48. But there is a path to victory. Join me in this fight, it is not too late. Your donations will incinerate these demons and send them back to the hell from whence they came. Hallelujah. To those of you who doubt my message, I say this... You girls be careful now. Why? You don't think we can fend for ourselves? There's a lot of evil out there, and you seem like nice girls, is all. - Thank you so much. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Have a good one. What are you doing? Stop. ...traffic due to construction. Police came across another grisly murder scene last night. Wait. I wanna hear that. What are you doing? Stop. Go back. I wanna listen to that. Three youths found stabbed to death inside a suburban home. The walls covered in satanic symbols. This brings the death toll to 18 in what many believe to be the workings of a satanic cult burning their way through America's Heartland. Famed televangelist, Pastor John Henry Butler, denounced the murders today on his nationally syndicated program. - Let's just change it. - Listen. Just relax. Be cool. Let's change it, I don't wanna listen to this. - Just relax, Beverly. - You're such a baby. Fine. Whatever you want. That's better. - Oh, my God. - What is that? Pull over. Alex, pull over. Oh, my God. Damn it. Damn it. Fuck! - Jerkoff! - Fuck you, asshole! Hey! Fuckhead! - Fuck! Damn it! - Fuck. - Ew. - What is it? Don't touch it. It's a chocolate milkshake. It's a chocolate milkshake. - Okay. - Can I have... - Here. Use this. - Yeah. Thank you. This is disgusting. - This isn't... - Is now the time? Val, just hurry up and help. - Don't give that to me. - Val? Can you help? What am I supposed to do? As if Val's gonna touch this. She's not gonna do shit. Oh, my God. - Just use the windshield wipers. - Just let me see if... I just got my nails done. This is actually making it worse. - This is making it worse. - Just use the windshield wipers. I don't understand what's wrong with people. - That's fine. - Okay. That's working. Okay. Come on, Val. Don't light a cigarette. We're leaving now. Oh, it's so stressful. It's fine. Get in, Val. People are nuts. At least it's not shit. Hey! - Fuck, yeah, baby! - Yeah! Here we are. - Okay. No. Sorry, no. - Do you guys have extra tickets? Please tell me you have an extra ticket. - No. No. No. - No? - We're driving away now. - Jeez. - Oh, yeah! - Beverly, please do not slow us down today. I'm coming. Val? - Yeah? - Can you do the honors? Sure. - I want no part. - For sure. Beverly, you have to. - This is my favorite part. - No, I... - Beverly. - I don't drink anymore. We're drinking together, it's liquid courage. Take the cup. Put it to your mouth. Put it in your throat. We're not gonna tell anyone, it'll be like it never happened. - Drink. - That's not the point. Drink the drink. Cheers to a night that we're gonna remember for years to come. - Hear, hear. - Cheers. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Ah. Mm! - That was enough anyway. - It's sharp. Ready? Pull that down. Oh. My ring's stuck in my hair. Don't sell your souls for rock 'n' roll. Oh, my God. Look at this guy. - Guys. - Yeah, guys. Is that that van? - Oh, my God. - It is the van. Let's teach them some manners. Do we knock on the door? Have you lost your mind? That is a horrible idea. Shh, shh, shh, shh. - They're in there. - Stay there. - Val, I swear to God... - What are you doing? Shut up. Oh. Yes. Shit. This is a horrible idea. No, wait, wait, wait. - Oh, fuck! - Jesus! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Jesus! Oh! Happy Fourth of July, dickwads! - The fuck was that? - Impressive. What the fuck is funny about this? I don't know. Were you driving on Route 9 this morning? Yeah. So what? So payback's a bitch, isn't it? What the hell are you talking about? You threw a milkshake at our window, we could've died. - Shit. - Oh. That was you? Don't throw your trash out of a moving car, man. Come on, it was just messing around. It doesn't give you a right to mess up our car. Well, whatever. It wasn't cool. Listen. We're assholes, we're sorry. - We didn't mean to scare you. - Who said we were scared? Look. I think my friends are trying to say is... maybe... we can make it up to you. We're not interested. Wow, interesting. Oh, come on. Make me an offer. Do you have any more packs? Full case. Among other assorted fun items. All right. Fire away. Here we go. Watch out. Thanks. - Oh, Jesus. - There we go. Oh, just sprayed it on you. Hilarious. By the way, I'm Ivan. And it's a pleasure to meet you. Mark. Kovacs. What's up? I'm, um, Alexis, and this is Val and Beverly. So, what, were you guys, like, in the middle of a circle jerk - or something? - Oh, hell yeah. - Just finished up. - Yeah. You guys wanna see my bong? It's like... Rock on, dude. These guys fucking suck, let's get out of here, please. - I wanna go. - Okay. We were just about to light up a hippie. Where are you going? - Yeah. Okay. - Hey, Beverly. Shit. Just go. All right, hippie fucks. Ready for Soldiers of Satan? - Yes. - Yes, fucking sure. Fourth show we've seen on this tour. - Four? - Yeah. We just actually saw them in Cleveland. Caravanning, it's nice. I thought only Deadheads did that. Oh, no, fuck those granolas. We do it differently. Are you guys in a band or something? - Mm-hmm. - We were. - Mark here's moving out to LA. - Mm-hmm. - Mark? - It is true. Ditching our asses. - Shut the fuck up. - I'm talking true, man. Sorry. What's your axe? Uh, drums. Bass, synth, sometimes backing vocals. And I am the front man. And woo! Wow. That's not creepy at all. What? Oh, yeah. Fucking first the backwards songs. Now satanic ritual murders. What will they come up with next? How many people have been killed now? - It's 15. - Hmm. Uh, no, you know, I'm pretty sure it was 12. Yeah. But after last night, it's 15. Uh, no. After last night, it's 12. Uh, you know, you would be right if you knew how to fucking count, 'cause you'd know it was 15. - That's right. It's 12. - That's the number that it is. - It's 18. - It's... Remember the three they killed in Tallahassee last week? - Oh. - It's 18. Eighteen, dude. Come on. You know what you and I should do? What? Me and you? Have you shotgunned a beer before? You can teach me if you want, though. Is that a Doublehead back patch? Yeah. It's my first concert. No way. Yeah. Straight to Hades tour, I had to sneak out. You just take this. Ooh. What was yours? Um, Ozzy. - Diary of a Madman. - No way. It was Randy Rhoads's last show. - Oh, shit? Yeah. - Oh, before he quit? Like, uh, died in a plane crash. Right. Yeah. It was a bummer. Alexis, what was your first show? Um, God, it's been so long. I don't think I can remember... I think you, uh, said that it was Scorpions. - Oh, yeah. It was. - Oh. - I love me some Scorps. - It was an awesome show. My first show was, uh, Dio. Cool. No, it wasn't. Yeah. No, it wasn't. It was KC and The Sunshine Band, because... ...I was there. Gotta fucking do it, you always gotta go there. And his mom chaperoned the whole time. Every fucking time we have this conversation. First of all, go fuck yourself, okay? - Well, I'm sorry. - And second of all, KC and The Sunshine Band actually has some good songs, so let's not write them off. Def Lep, Pyromania, April 30th, 1983. I'm a real civic sinner. - Oh. Nice. - You remember the date? Nice. It's the night I popped my cherry. A special day. You guys coming with us? Guys, we should go with them. Come on, come on. Let's go. - Yeah. - Let's go see the show. One more.

Hey. I saw what you did. I saw what you did. Best show in the fucking tour! - Nice job, boys. - Holy shit. Oh, my God. That was bitchin'. That was fucking awesome. Kovacs? - Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Did you break your nose? No, no, it just... It just gushes sometimes. Is that gonna be okay? All right. Well, we're gonna go. - We're gonna go to our car. - Thanks, guys. Shit. Come on, the night's young. Why don't we keep the party going? Depends on what you have in mind. Well, let's hit a bar. - Can't be too hard to find. - Are you kidding me? There's no bars. There's, like, 7-Elevens and Dairy Queens. We could, uh... - We could hang in the van? - The van. Yeah. As appealing as that... - It sounds nice. - Just give us one second. I'm just gonna... With these stupid jokes, they're gonna be, like, "He's mysterious." That's the whole thing. Let's just bring it down a notch. They're kind of perfect, and the little drummer boy is totally into you, Beverly. Yeah. I was thinking that. Beverly! - Fuck it. Okay. - Okay. - Okay, okay. - All right. Guys. So, we're staying at my dad's house. It's, like, 30 minutes from here. We have booze. We have a great sound system. - We have Nintendo. - Oh. - Very classy. - We have everything. I Metroid like a mofo, so I'm in. - Great. - Yeah. Okay. So meet us at the turn-off right outside the exit. We're in the red car, and you guys can follow us. - Done. - Great. - Got it, got it, got it. - I got to take a piss. All right. Wait for me. Don't you dare leave without us. - We'll just meet out there. - We'll be in the car. Go, you go, we'll be right behind you guys. - Okay. - Oh, excuse us! - Rock on! - We will wait for you. That's why I'm the master at what I do, I'm telling you. Do you know who's so sexy? Uh, who, Val? Judd Nelson. Who's Judd Nelson? No, no, no. But if I do meet another dude that's in a fucking boy band, I swear to God, I'm gonna just cut him up, slice him up one by one. - You need a Light? - Yeah. There you go, buddy. Oh, my God. - No way. - That sounds great. Quick, before the... Before the gate closes. Holy shit. What the fuck do her parents do for a living? - They're kings. - Jesus Christ. - Got that a little, right? - We're here, girls. Oh. Oh, my God. Why are we parking all the way down here? We don't need anyone to know we're here. - Oh, wow. Nice. - How about this shit? Hell of a night. Oh, my goodness. Is there, uh, like... - You ready for this? - ...hot tub situation? - I'll show you the hot tub. - Oh, really? Get her in there. Here we are. It's formal. - Oh, shit. - Willkommen. Come in. Bienvenue. - Excuse me. - Welcome. Sorry. So, that's the living room, obviously. This is the dining room, kitchen, bedroom's upstairs, so you can go anywhere you want. Whoa, so your dad owns this place? What is he, A. Busch? The Vice President? No, fool. The beer, Busch. Holy shit. Look at how cute you were. - Oh, hey. - Such a little baby. You went to Catholic school, whoa, you got, like... That's great. Why don't you guys go out and show them outside? We'll take the party out there. Go outside. It's really nice in the backyard. - Just take them outside. - I got it. Yeah. Good God. What did we do to deserve this shit? Oh, yeah. Well, it's not like fucking hair metal bands like Twisted Sister, fucking Motley Crue. It's fucking Metallica, it's fucking Slayer. It's, uh... Metallica has never recovered since Dave Mustaine left. And I don't care who says it. - He didn't leave, he was fired. - Okay, whatever. If Mustaine never left, we'd never get Megadeth. - Yeah? - Forget Mustaine, dude. How are they ever gonna replace Cliff? He's such a cutie. - Oh, yes. - They got that new guy. What's his name? Jason Newsted. - Yeah. Well... - Yeah. ...whoever he is, he's got some big shoes to fill because Cliff was a goddamn genius. I guess we'll find out soon, right? - Yeah. - When's that new album drop? - In a month. - Yeah. Very soon. Here, everybody. To Cliff Burton, ladies and gentlemen. Pour a little bit out. There we go. Oh. Oh. Hello. - Hey. - You come to warm me up? - Yeah. - All right. So... Do you guys come out here a lot? So, uh, you guys... come out here... Never mind. Dang. Swing and a miss. Swing and a miss. Hey. You're being antisocial. Well, I've never really done anything like this before. Yeah. Well, just relax and do what I do, all right? Look, Bev, I know... I know that you're new to our group. And you know Val and I tease you a little bit sometimes. But I'm really glad that you decided to come tonight and I think that this is gonna be a really, really big step for you. And I'm proud of you. Yeah. Thanks for being good friends. We're more than that. We're sisters. Right? - Yeah. - Right. Yeah. So, come on. Let's get this party started. Let's do it! - Oh, shit! - Oh, my God. - I'm so sorry. - That's okay. - Fuck. - Sorry. Um, here, I'll... - Are you okay? - Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. - Sorry. Smells like shit now. - No, that's okay. Here, it's a bit cold. Take mine. - No, it's all right. - No, please, take mine. Thanks. Looks better on you than me. - Oh. - Oh, sorry. I'll take that. It's my brother's. You want me to help you make more or... Um, no, that's enough. They'll be okay. Fuck. Cute. See that? That was fucking nice. Such a fucking romantic. Hey. I come bearing gifts. - This is for you. - Why, thank you. You're welcome. Handsome boy. One for you. Oh, thank you. What is this? - Family recipe. - Family recipe? Hey. - Hey. - Hey, this is for you. - All right. - Yeah. - Oh, thank you. - Hey, Bev. What's your problem? - He has a switchblade. - So? He has a fucking switchblade. Stop being so paranoid. It's not like he's gonna murder us. Just relax. All right, everyone. A toast! - All right. - A toast. A toast. - Woo! - Yes! Let the madness begin. Ah... - Cheers! - To madness! - Madness! Hear, hear. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Rock 'n' fucking roll. Yeah. - And your mom. - Cheers. Woo! Mm. Yow! Okay. You guys wanna play a game? - Yeah. - Yeah? What kind of game? Have you ever played Never Have I Ever? No. I have never played Never Have I Ever. Does that mean I win? No, you idiot. Basically, you just go around in a circle and you say, "Never have I ever," and then you say something that you haven't done. And then if you've done the thing the other person says that they haven't, you drink. Does that make sense? - Sounds good. - Cool. I'm, like, so confused right now. It's okay, it's easy. I'll go and then you'll pick it up. If you don't understand, I'll... You'll figure it out. Bev, sit down. I don't... I don't need to play. I'll just watch, you guys can... Bev. Bullshit, everybody's got to play. Play. Come on, play. Play, play, play, play! Sit down and play. - Play, play, play, play! - Jesus Christ! So... Never have I ever gone streaking. - Oh, shit. - Ivan. Drink up. Yeah. I'm gonna be drunk in about five minutes. Yeah. You and me both, baby. Oh. All right. Mark, you go. Okay. Never have I ever spent the night in jail. Oh, come on, man. That's just messed up. You can't just target people. You too? I was, uh, drunk and... ...disorderly. What were you in for? Shoplifting. Shoplifting? What? Clothes or... Food. Food? Come on, if I could, like... Kovacs, drop it. Ivan, you go. Uh, yeah. Uh... Never have I ever... No, did that. Um, all right. Never have I ever... pissed my pants. Oh, Val. I got a weak bladder. That was an insane night. You remember? Wait, wait, careful. We don't want another accident. All right, what do you got, Val? Never have I ever hurled in a church. Ooh. - That's what you went with? - That's you, baby. - Yeah. Drink up. - No! Okay. I'm gonna need a lot of fucking details. Did you just go, like, full Exorcist, just spraying pea soup everywhere? I was sick. I mean, it's boring, I had a... I had a stomach flu. - Head spinning. - She was really sick. It's kind of boring and stupid. Did you spin your head around a few times and just say, "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me." That's dumb. I mean, I'm not the first person to get the stomach flu. - Kovacs. - Oh, me? - Yeah. It's your turn. - Oh, I have one. Um, never have I ever decided to ditch my friends and go to California to become a fucking rock star. Oh, fuck you. Fuck you, Mark. Drink up. That's a low blow, man. Come on. Sorry, was that too much or... Hitting him hard. - Alex. - Mm? Do you think you can top that one? Yeah, I think I can top that one. Never have I ever... drugged someone's drink. Yeah. Uh, not me. Yeah. That's fucked up, is what that is. Oh. Oh. - Fuck off. - You gotta be kidding me. Seriously? No. Drink up, Bev. Oh, no shit. Okay. Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. So you're saying, like, all three of you have drugged somebody's drink at some point? Okay. Like whose? Why? Oh, no. Oh, it's us? I don't buy that for one fucking second. Ladies, you don't have to drug our drinks to... have sex with us. I mean... Oh, you didn't think that we're gonna have sex with you, did you? What? You did. Oh, that's so precious, that's really sweet. I mean, why would you think that we were gonna have sex with you? - Okay, uh... - Okay, uh... I'm sorry we were... Things just got really fucking weird, so, uh... I'm gonna have to bid you ladies a good evening and thank you for all of your hospitality. And, uh, we're gonna... We're gonna have... Kovacs? - Okay. Go for it. - Mark! Mark, what the... Mark! - Mark? Mark? - Is he not waking up? Oh, no. Oh! Oh, gosh. - Ivan. No. - Oh. - He's... - Oh, no. Ivan. You should go check on him. - You should wake him up. - Oh, gosh. Oh, no. Ivan. Dude, fucking... Okay. What the fuck did you do to him? - Uh, Mark? - What's happening? - Are you tired? - Mark. Oh, you poor baby. Honey. Are you okay? - Are you tired? - Me and you together forever. Are you asleep? Oh, I think you're asleep. Bev, Bev. Mm-hmm. - The bucket. - Yeah. Is she gonna be able to do this? She'd better be able to. What are you doing? Let's go. Let's fuckin' go. Here. Get it together, Beverly. Hello, boys. Hello, boys. Good morning, baby. How are you? Baby. I don't know what kind of fucked up game is this, but it's got to stop right now. I'm so sorry, I can't do that for you. And it's not a game. Holy shit. You're the fucking cult. What? Listen, just let us go. We'll drive away and you'll never see us again. That would be a good idea if I hadn't slashed your tires while you were passed out. Help! Help! - Fucking help us! - Help us! - Fucking psychos! - Help! "Help!" Help! Somebody fucking help! - Somebody! - They're fucking psychos! Try a little louder, honey. - You poor babies. - Please. I'm so sorry, boys. But we haven't been completely honest with you. The truth is... we don't care about any of this shit. Heavy metal and satanic cults, devil worship. It's all really just a giant crock of shit to me. So, you're not a satanic cult? Well, what the fuck is all of this, then? Is it fun being so stupid? You're killing people and making it look like a satanic cult. Exactly. Color me impressed. You must be the smart one. You killed all those people? No, actually those were the other members of our congregation. Mm-hmm. But tonight's our turn. And then next week it'll be another group's turn, and then the week after that it'll be another group's turn. Our reach is very far and very wide. And we're growing stronger every single day, thanks to people like you. - You're so fucking clueless. - Oh. We're clueless? Because we're not the one's tied up to chairs right now, are we? We're not devil worshipers. - Yeah. No, no, no, no. - None of us are. Don't you get it? We don't give a fuck who you are. No, we don't. You dress the part and you look the part, and the news is gonna fill in the rest for us. Yeah. They always do. And then when the public hears that there's been another satanic murder... ...they're gonna come to us for salvation, because they want their souls saved. You sick fucks. So, what, are you just murdering people? And then you're just gonna fucking lie to the whole country about it? It doesn't matter if it's true. It only matters if people believe it. And, boy, do they believe it. And the beautiful thing is that your deaths are actually gonna mean something. Like, your deaths are actually gonna save the lives of hundreds, if not thousands of people. Like, think about it. Who can say these days that they died for a good cause and for a good reason? You sound just like that asshole preacher, John Henry Butler. You shut the fuck up, you little piece of shit. Hey. Why don't you do me a favor? Why don't you explain to me what this silly little thing is? Hmm? It's a means of expression. And what are you trying to express? Defiance. Against what? I asked you a fucking question. Against what? People like you. Oh? People like us, people like us, who are trying to help people. People like us who are trying to spread Christ's word. We're trying to spread the word of our Lord and Savior. Good people trying to help the world. That's... That's what's wrong? - That's what's wrong with us? - It means that people are just closed-minded, ignorant fuckheads who just go around their whole life shitting on anything they don't understand! - Ivan, stop. - Shut up. What he means is hypocritical, lying, fucking pieces of shit - that invent a belief system... - Shut the fuck up! ...so they can persecute anyone who stands up against them. - Shut the fuck up! - What he means is a fucking weak... - Shut the fuck up! - ...cowardly sheep that has no original ideas of his own, who just blindly follows anyone who's the first person to blow in the fucking wind! Fuck, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! No, don't! God! Fuck! You fuckers! Told you to stop talking. Oh, no! Oh, God! Oh, fuck! That's much better. And you, you're not so defiant now, are you? Nothing left to be defiant about, is there? Beg for forgiveness. Please. Please. Beg for Christ's forgiveness before I kill you. Don't you want forgiveness from our Lord and Savior? So be it. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait! Jesus fucking Christ. What the hell, Beverly? I need to talk to you for a second. About what? - Beverly, shut the fuck up! - For a second. For a fucking second! For a second, okay? Can we talk in the bathroom? I'm listening! I can hear you from right here. They're not going anywhere. I knew you're gonna do some shit like this. So go! Go! Go! Fucking hell. They just killed him, man. They fucking killed him. Kovacs, look at me. You got to keep it together, okay? You got to keep it together. Well, then what the fuck are we supposed to do? You see my belt over there? Do you see my belt? Can you get it? Can you get to it? See if you can cut the tape with the spikes. Fuck. What? - I wanna do it. - What? Let me kill them. Get the fuck out of here. No, I'm... I'm serious. When I heard them talking it just confirms, like, everything you guys have taught me. They have to die. What? You know, I thought for a second maybe you're getting cold feet. No. No, it was... It was part of my act. Hmm. Okay. Here. So here's how it's gonna go. The dumb one is gonna get it in the neck, just like the big one. And then for little drummer boy, you're gonna go around from behind, you're gonna stab him in the heart. And that way it'll look like he killed his two friends and then he offered himself, it's classic murder suicide. - Yeah. - It's perfect and it's easy. - Come on! - I'm coming! Oh, fuck. Okay. Well, fuck. - Goddamn it! - Come on! Beverly, you bitch! Give me that fucking knife! - Come on. - Now! Holy shit. Come on! Shit! Shit! Damn it! Shit! Open the door! Fuck you! Move, move, move. Alex, move. Fuck! Ow! Goddamn it! Oh, my God. Open the door, boys. Fuck you! Let me write this down for you guys. Either you come out here and we kill you quickly, or you bleed to death slowly in there. So why don't you save yourselves the pain and suffering and just come out here? Fucking eat me, bitch! Open the goddamn door! Jesus Christ, dude. She fucking sliced me. All right, all right. - Shit. - Keep pressure on the door. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Holy shit. Holy shit. All right. All right. Lift your arm, lift your arm, lift your arm. Goddamn it! Holy sh... Ow, ow! Careful. - Open the goddamn door! - Holy shit. Don't just stand there. Go find something to break the door down with, Beverly. Where? I don't know. Why don't you go to the barn? There's a bunch of tools and shit in there. Go! If you don't go... this is all your fault. Their blood is on your hands, too. So just go. Jesus Christ! Goddamn it. Okay. Fucking "Ruby Tuesday" over here. Shit. Oh. - Are you okay? - I'm gonna need a tampon, dude. - Shit. - Boys. Do you wanna have a threesome with us? Alex is very religious, but she will do it on this occasion only. I'm taking that as a yes. - Oh, my God. - I'm a little bit drunk. Oh, what? Oh, I think I found something. Is it another box of Twinkies? Because this one's done. Don't say I never get you nice things. Oh, baby, is it my birthday? Come here. We'll all go down. Here. Okay. Oh, damn, girl. Just take everything so fucking seriously. Shh. What the fuck? Holy shit. Stay there, stay there. Hey, hey. Move away from the handle, move away from the handle. Now get away, get away, get away. Yeah, you like that, fuckers? - Oh, what did you say? - You want some more? - Fuck. Don't breathe in. - Cover your mouth. Are they blocking it? I think they're fucking blocking it. Go get, Bev. Where the hell... - Who the fuck is that? - Shh. - Who the fuck is... - Shut up! Fuck. - Lexi? - Oh, shit. It's my stepmom. Just don't say anything. Hi. Lexi. Oh, my God, what happened to your forehead? And why on earth are you dressed like this? Val and I went to a costume party, and there were some drunk guys there. And someone threw something, and it hit me in the eye. Well, what did I tell you about parties like that? They attract a bad element. Aren't you supposed to be in Turks and Caicos? Yeah, I... That's tomorrow. I think I left my passport here. Uh, um, hi, Valerie. Hi, Mrs. Butler. No, I'm back to Miss Stone now. Oh, sorry, the divorce. I'm not. Dude, your stepmom has coke boogers. Hallelujah. It's getting cold, man. You're going into shock. You need some sugar. Can you drink this? Here. What? What? Mm. Now, we're getting out of here, man. How? Huh? We're getting the fuck out. We're getting the fuck out of here. What are you... Are you going MacGyver or something? Yeah. Did you find it? Um, my passport? Yeah. - Right where I thought it'd be. - Good. Right. Next time you see me, I'll have a tan to die for. Right. Have a nice trip, Miss Stone. God bless. And you, put some ice on that. Yeah, I will. Oh, you know, if the police show up, just tell them it was a false alarm. What? Well, I saw the lights on, there's some van parked behind the house, so I thought maybe somebody was robbing the place. Is that yours? I'm borrowing it from a friend. It's my friend's van. You called the police? Yeah, from my car phone. I tried your father to see if... You called Daddy? Yes, Alexis. We still speak. Just... Okay. Like I said, just say it was a false alarm, okay? I got... I... I gotta go, bye. Okay. What was that? What was what? - I didn't hear anything. - It's probably just fireworks. Who else is in this house? There's no one in the house. What are you two girls up to? We're not doing anything. It's late. I think you should go. Alexis, you better tell me what is going on. I really, really think that you should go. You are gonna be in big trouble, unless you tell me what's going on, young lady. This is not your house anymore! So why don't you just go? We're just having a slumber party. Just chill the fuck out! Just... - Don't go into the... - Oh! Oh! Don't go to the... Stop! Stop! Oh, my lord. What? Oh, my God! Alexis! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my, God! Oh, my God! Holy shit! You just fucking killed your stepmom, Alex. Yeah, well, I really didn't have much of a choice, did I? Just stick to the plan. Stick to what plan, Alex? She called the fucking cops. Yeah, she also called my dad, so we have to finish this right now. Are you with me? - Uh... - Val? Val? Are you with me? Yes, I'm fucking with you, yes. I'm gonna go to the pantry, we're gonna get the boys out, we're gonna finish this, and we're gonna go home, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. I'm gonna pee. I'm gonna help you up, all right? - Yeah, get me the fuck up. - Are you ready? - Yup. - Three, two, one. All right. Boys! "The Lord will execute judgment by fire. And those slain will be many." Isaiah 66:16. Uh, chapter and fucking verse. - Ready? - Yeah. Okay. Fire in the hole! Fuck! Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Fuck you! Fucking God. Damn! Psycho fucks. Do it again. Do it again. You fuckers! - Ow, fuck! - Alexis? - Alexis. - What? They're here. Oh, shit. Oh! What are we gonna do? Just... Just stay there. Good evening, Officer. Hi. Somebody call 911? Oh, yeah, like, this is such a misunderstanding. I'm, like, so totally embarrassed. Like, oh, my God. You're not gonna believe this. My stepmom, she forgot my friend and I were staying here this weekend, even though we told her, like, a gazillion times, 'cause she's such a space cadet, and then, you know she came by to get her passport, and she freaked out when she saw lights on, and she totally called you guys so, like, it's just one big misunderstanding. But thank you so much for coming by. Is she here? - I'm sorry? - Is your stepmom here? Um, yeah, she is, but she's asleep, and I don't wanna wake her up, 'cause she's, like, totally moody, so... You said she just stopped by to get her passport? Yes, she did. Then it got to be, like, super-duper late. She's, like, "I'm just gonna spend the night, and I'm gonna leave in the morning." And the highway's probably flooded with, like, a gazillion DUIs, so I'm gonna let you go. You have an ID? Proves this is your residence, ma'am? Totally. Can I see it? Oh, well, like, I don't have it, like, on me, on me. You know, it's, like, it's in the house. Okay. Well, I'd get it. And if you could, tell your stepmom I'd like to have a few words with her. No. Why not? I don't have to show you my ID, and I sure as hell don't have to get my stepmom for you, - 'cause I know my rights. - Okay, ma'am... This has been one big misunderstanding, and that should be good enough for you, Officer. Okay. Ma'am, I'm gonna ask you to put both hands on top of the squad vehicle, please. Excuse me? I said I'd like for you to put both hands on top of the squad vehicle now, and I'm not gonna ask you again. Hey! Hey, stop. Hey! Stop. Stop! - Hide. - Okay. County sheriff. I need any and all occupants of this house to come out and put your hands up. I will shoot. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. I repeat, this is the sheriff. Anyone in this house, come out with your hands up. Now! Final warning. Hey, hey, don't shoot. Don't shoot, please. - Hands where I can see them! - My friend needs help! Shut up. Get your hands where I can see 'em. Hands where I can see 'em. Both of you, now! Shut up, turn around, hands against the wall. There's three girls in this house. They're trying to fucking kill us, all right? Please, can you just get us out of here? - Three girls did this to you? - Yes! They killed one of our friends in the other room. They're psychopaths, Officer, sir. - Please. - Turn around, face the wall. He needs to get to a fucking doctor! - He's bleeding out. - Turn around and face the wall! - Shit. - Before I shoot you both. Fuck, you're making a big mistake, man. Please. Shut up. Fuck. I said shut... Oh! Shit! Fucking fuck! Val, what the fuck did you do? Stick to the plan, right? Yeah. You killed a cop, Val. Yes. And now I have his gun. Shit. You hear that, bitches? We got a fucking gun! - Oh, fuck. - Jesus, fuck! Stop wasting the bullets, you moron. Don't call me a fucking moron. Then stop acting like one. You're being... - Give me the gun. - I'm not gonna give you the gun. You're being a retard. Give me the gun. - Fuck, it's... I... - Val! I can handle a fucking gun, Alexis. I'm gonna kill you if... You're gonna kill us fucking both! No one is killing anyone. Fuck. Oh, wait a second, Beverly. I knew it! I fucking knew it! Get the fuck out of my way! - Beverly... - You fucking do this. Val, stop it. Beverly... Tell me what's wrong. What's wrong? This whole fucking thing is what's wrong. We are doing the Lord's work here, Beverly. Oh, shut the fuck up already! Boys, I'm coming for you! Fuck you! Hey, stay the fuck out of this! Beverly... Here, take this. It's our only chance. We gotta go now, all right? - We gotta go now. - Now? - Yes, let's go. - I just... - Come on. - I... - Come on. - I just... I don't... I don't think I can go out there, man. No, no. Kovacs, we're fucking going out there together. I... Look at me. I can't fucking... I... If you wanna sit and die here by yourself, that's fine. I'd rather go out fighting. I'd rather you fucking be with me. Fuck it. Let's do it. You came to us. We took you in. You didn't have anything before us. You didn't have a home, you didn't have a family. We gave you a fucking purpose, Beverly. No, you took advantage of me! You took advantage of me, okay? Just like your father is taking advantage of all of his followers. What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about. I know what he's doing with the donations, Alexis. Val, he is pocketing all of them. He's not building youth shelters. He's building more fucking rad pads like this one. You poor little lamb. You're so lost, you don't even know what's real anymore. Get the fuck out of my way. - All right. Come on. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ready? Okay? - Okay. - Ready. There's only one way out of here, Beverly. And it's with me. So are you with me... or not? Get the fuck off of me! One. Two. Three. Stop, stop, stop! Stop. She's with us. She just tried to kill us, like, two minutes ago. I'm not with anyone. I was trying to end this thing. Okay. I'm calm. I'm gonna call the cops. Let me check. It's not too deep, you're okay. What the fuck are you doing with these two? It's not entirely their fault. It's not their fault? They were brainwashed, man. What the fuck are you talking about? Ivan's dead. Kovacs. What the fuck? Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Okay. Okay. Hey, look at me, look at me. Get us some water. Hey. Look at me in the eyes. You with me? Hey, hey. Hey. Here. Here, here. Hang in there. Keep breathing. Just keep breathing, all right? That's it. Oh, fuck. You're safe. - We gotta carry him out of here. - I know. We gotta get him to the hospital. Where are the car keys? - Where are the car keys? - Alexis has them. Fuck. All right. I gotta go get them then. Fuck. Wait, I... Hold on. I don't think we should separate. Mark, I don't think we should split up. He's bleeding out. The only way we're gonna get him to a doctor in time is in a car, all right? You stay with him. Kovacs. Hey, Kovacs. We're getting outta here. All right? All right. Fuck. Okay. Okay. Keep drinking, you gotta stay hydrated, all right? Fuck. Here. Give me your light. Give me your light. What? Give me your fucking light. Okay. Okay. I gotta stop Val. No. You're not gonna leave me, are you? I don't have a fucking choice, man. All right? - Come on, let's get you... - Wait, wait. Come on. Ready? One, two, three. - Okay. - Okay. Holy shit. Deep breath. All right? Okay. Here, here. - Help. - What's going on? Shit. All right. All right. Relax. All right? I'm gonna be back, okay? Okay. Okay. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Help, help. Please, Officer. Please, help. Please, you got to... What's going on here? You have to help us, sir. We're... Just calm down, okay, and tell me what's going on. It's so fucked up. I... All right. Let's start with why are the police here. They... They killed the police. They killed the police, man, and I... Who? The three girls. They're... There's... These three girls, they killed my friend. My other friend's in there. You got to help him, please. Listen to me. I've got a cellular phone in my car. I want you to call 911. Just give me the gun, and I'll go get your friend. They're psycho... Psychopaths. I understand. It's gonna be okay. Please, son, just hand me the weapon. Hey, I know you. You're that pastor... I'm the wrath of God. Good riddance. Damn it. No, uh-uh. All right. You don't have to do this, Val. I don't have to do this? What? You wanna be best friends and braid each other's hair? She's brainwashing you. Fuck you. You wanna be my best friend, huh? Oh, can you breathe? Sorry, baby. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What happened? Shit. Okay. Pastor is here. What? S... S... Save Mark. - Please. Please. - What? What? Save Mark. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Fuck. Dad. Phew. You really screwed this one up, Alexis. - It's not my fault. - Quiet! Yes, sir. There's a sheriff's corpse in the kitchen. Your stepmom has bled out like a stuck pig in the family room, and I had to shoot one of the bastards in the driveway. Now, how are we gonna explain this? It was Beverly. Beverly? Yeah. The runaway. Where is she now? She, uh, ran away again? Val... Val's taking care of her. You told me she was ready. You told me she could do this. I thought that she was. I'm sorry, but I can fix this. - I can fix it. - It's too late for that now. They already suspect us, and now this? We're gonna have to make some sacrifices. What kind of sacrifices? What did Daddy call you when you were a little girl, and you fell off your bike? Reckless Alexis? - Yeah. - Yeah. And that's what you've been here tonight. Right? Reckless and careless. And you've put everything I've worked so hard for in jeopardy. - I don't know what to do. - Shh. Hey, hey. But it's okay. We're gonna do something drastic, unexpected. I don't unders... Why do you think I chose you for this mission? Why do you think I chose this house? It's the only way to erase any doubt in their minds. They'll have no choice but to believe. But it's okay, baby. You're gonna die a martyr, like... Oh, my God. You saved me. Thank you. Thank you. It was my dad. You heard him? He set me up. He set us up. Shut the fuck up, Alexis. Just listen to me. We can get out of here. You and me, just help me. We can get out of here. We're innocent. We're victims. I'm a victim! This is on you. It was my dad. - He did this. - This is on you! You... You've always been useless! You've always been a fucking waste! You've always... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, God. Okay. Okay. Okay. Come here. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, come on. I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna make it. What? What are you doing? Yes, you are. Come here. Look. Come on. Come on. Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Another gruesome ritualistic murder suicide claimed the lives of six people last night, following a heavy metal concert that local religious groups were protesting. The murders took place at the country estate of Pastor John Henry Butler, and are believed to be orchestrated by his own daughter, Alexis. Pastor Butler happened upon the perpetrators and bravely fought them off, suffering only minor cuts and bruises. Pastor Butler, the founder of The Daughters of the Dawn, a nationwide congregation for wayward girls, spoke to reporters outside his home moments ago. My daughter was confused. Like so many young people today. Amen. And in her confusion, she turned to a deadly and devious group of individuals hell-bent on spreading Satan's message. Ask yourselves, how many more children must die in Satan's name? I just hope we all can work together, figure out a way to end this evil... 30.67. No more questions, please. Authorities are still on the lookout for the culprits responsible for this slew of murders, a satanic cult that call themselves We Summon the Darkness. You know, you shouldn't believe everything you see. Sorry. Morning. Where are we? Hell if I know.
