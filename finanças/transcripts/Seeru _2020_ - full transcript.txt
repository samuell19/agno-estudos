Right after the temple the cops stopped us and are misbehaving with us Please, everyone forward this message If this message reaches anyone nearby, please help us! So, you won't open the door? She sent a clear message to everyone! What's the reply? 'Who is that cop? Send his photo?' 'Let's post it and insult him on Facebook' reply from a guy They only react in Facebook No one's gonna come in person and help them! The message would've gone viral if it was day. Thankfully it's night What did you reply on that post? A clear reply saying 'Nothing to worry. The police only came to help us and nothing else' To that a reply came saying 'Happy journey. Take care' No one's gonna reply after this Like a quick coffee on the freeway, everything would have got over with only one of you. But now... What is it? - A reply - Saying what? 'On the way' Someone's bluffing to make them feel better. No one's coming Don't we know from our experience? Again! Not a text this time Voice message 'I know that place, where you are' 'This happens regularly over there' 'I'm from neighborhood. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Stay there, no matter what!' 'I promise, I'll be there!' 'You're like a brother to us now! Please come soon!' Look at that! Did that voice feed some courage into you? You heard him! He said 'I'm from neighborhood. I'll be there in 10 minutes' 'This happens regularly over there.' Stay there, no matter what!' he said those word clear! Go, check out who is coming here! If you come back safe and in shape... we both will be ready to fulfill any of your desires! Looks like he is here! Let him come. He won't make it home! Brother! Give me 10 minutes Let me bash them up. I'll be back Hope you both are alright Thanks a lot, brother! Come on. Please don't mention it What made you come here? They had already replied to my message Your voice message sounded clear that you were in danger Those fools replied even without realizing caps lock was ON It was a clear give away that someone else took your phone What is it? I hope everything's fine - Hope I'm not late - We're fine You're the reason we are safe today If something had happened, my life would've been ruined - Come on, now - I'm getting married soon The groom is also a cop.

You guys are already 10 minutes late You guys don't need this Why do you wanna do all this? That too towards strangers! We aren't protesting here to close the liquor shop Those who turn up here are our relatives Instead of earning a living, they turn up here early in the morning You guys do have a point We have been appointed here to ignore all such justified arguments and points If I don't do my job i.e. stop people like you... then I won't be able to earn bread and butter for my family, this month What is it? Are they gathering up? Are they protesting? Such acts have become a fashion statement! Don't harm the girls. Trace out their father's names Sundar. Dhanapal. Manohar Ramurthy. Rajendran Few girls are pleading to men, who are turning up at our liquor shop to drink Hit them! Break their arms and legs! Look what they are doing instead of going to school Excuse me, other girls had their father to take them away My father won't come to drive me away Because last month, you were the one who cremated him! I'm Dhanapal's daughter - Dhanapal's daughter? - Yes, chief Forget it I call up the cops and ask a lady cop to take care of her. Don't harm her Chief! Chief! Now what? Manimaran is here! Is it?! Murthy! Turn on the television! Now! Look, she is our late friend Dhanapal's daughter! Oh my God! Poor girl! Lost her father and now she's fighting all alone! If a little girl can protest then why can't we? Come on! Sir! Sir! Hold on Come on, now. For 3 generations you and your family members have been the MLA here And why do you want to indulge in this silly issue. He just runs a local channel And you're afraid of him? For the reputation your father and grandfather had... Reputation? Reputation; my foot! Do you've any idea about Manimaran from Mayavaram? He just runs a local channel? He's the BBC of this town! Have you ever witness sun rise in Mayavaram? He wakes up everyone here. I am unable to do anything about him! Sir! Sir! Just wait Greetings chief Chief, so much crowd within a short span of time?! Stop! Stop here He gathered the whole of Mayavaram in 5 minutes! Who is he? Where is he? Point him to me Now that he has gathered the crowd... he won't be here now! Why did we leave when people have gathered over there? If I had been there then that crowd would be behind me This is their problem and they must handle it on their own All we need here is someone to bell the cat Why do people name their kids after leaders and not after objects? Just a hope they'll grown up to be like those leaders! My name is Mani (bell), shouldn't I live up to my name? Manimara, don't you know about my grandfather, Aaruchamy? Guess what it means to remove the holy thread and tie on the waist To tighten their lowers? Means, we priests also know about thug life! Go ask the lady of Rage! - No, thanks! - Tell him about me Yes, he and his family has been struggling of late. No one's even tipping us Please tip him and help him I didn't ask you to tell this! Dear brother, what's the issue between you and MrGru? Quiet, little sister. Grandpa had said that hurt the priest and it'll bring droughts No! Cut tress and that will bring droughts! Why are you scared of these wuss? Manimara, do you want to explain your sister about this issue or shall we? Quiet or he'll bash you up! What's the problem? Will you solve it? It's been there for 3 years now! Look at that! Why is the temple bell so weak here? What's with that bell, brother? Your elder brother just won't allow us to replace it! Earlier, if you ring the bell here, in Mayavaram and it'll be heard it Tanjavur! But now, it's not even audible till the entrance Then how will prayers be answered? - How will God grant wishes? - Wait, who donated the bell here? It was my grandfather and before that my great grandfather! We have been doing it for generations! "One child for a family and bell for the temple" said my grandpa In fact I was named Manimaran after the bell So? Just wait for 2 more months Once my nephew or niece is born, 250 kilos brand new Brass bell is waiting Ring it here and not in Tanjavur... it'll be heard all over Tamil Nadu! Oh really? Is it a brass bell or comedian Tony Bell? I don't care if it rains or not, I'm gonna rough him up and hang him! You little brat! It's all because of you - Ilakya! - Ilakya! Catch her! Watch out! Ilakya! - Ilakya! Ilakya! - This is happening to her again, dude! Lift her up! Take her to an hospital, at once! - Dear! Ilakya! - Lift! Sister! Here! Little sister, nothing will happen to you! Dear little sister, you're fine. Wake up Nothing to worry! Stay strong! Ok, little sister! Stay strong, dear! Listen to me, dear! Don't give up! Stay strong! Manimara, why did you do this to us? You tricked us into getting our son married to a girl having fits! I had set up good alliances for my son from reputed rich families! You don't get tension After all for peanuts he flew abroad for work now! Will she ever deliver a child? Tell me! Let's wait and watch! Can you shut up? Don't call yourselves friends. You all ruined my son's life! - Shut up! - I curse you! I can't take my mom's tantrum about marrying my friend's own sister! Our friends always are our well wishers Wonder why relatives are so mean and cheap! Sister, brothers... everyone! "She'll never get married but she got married now!" "She'll never give birth to a child but now that's happening" They keep throwing such tantrums! They keep telling me that if she delivers a baby, that baby will also have her problem! It's horrible! Why are you worried about all this? If I stay here, I'll murder them all and go to prison! After my kid is born, I'll be here on the 10th day! We'll celebrate in a grand manner! Those who threw tantrums at us, we'll serve them a feast! Fits occurrence is common during delivery time for women But handling a delivery for a woman having fits is no easy task If labour pain and fits occur at same time... we will only be only able to save either the mother or the child Please take immense care of her I don't know what better recommendation I can give I repeat... When she gets labour pain, fits must not occur When she has a fits attack, she must not get the labour pain at any cost! Please! Ok, doctor. Thanks Don't worry, brother I know you won't let me die so easy I won't die before handing my child to you Suppose, if I die... I'll be reborn as your daughter I hope you will pamper me and take care of me very well then also No matter what, I will be with you forever Saw that? He was looking at a new born with a yearning Why? Because even a new born is taller than him! Here he is What did the doctor say? It's ok, I know what she'd have said. Nothing new! The doctor would have repeated the same old things! Where are you? The movie has started Almost there. In the parking lot Fine! Make it fast! - Which row? - C row P? C row. C for Sea - Hang up! - Make it fast C for Sea? Then what? Saw? Shut up and watch! I climbing up the stairs. Tell me properly. Which ro... "Oh! What a fragrance!" Such a fragrance in our hood? "Though far away, is there any way I could get closer to her?" "Oh my! She's got a beautiful pair of eyes" "Who is she? Only God knows the truth" "I can see her fragrance shower like flower petals" She is not from here! "Her smile is driving this boy crazy and stealing his heart away" "What kind of magic is this feeling?" Whoa! My bike! "Shall we embark on a new journey is this life? What do you say?" Dad! Can you hear me? - Dad, can you hear me? - Hello? - Can you hear me? - Hello, can you hear me now, dad? The bride and groom are ahead, in the procession The band is loud, right behind me - It's too loud. Hence, I can't hear you - Hello? - When will you be back? - In 4-5 days - Convey it to mom too. Hello! - Hello! - Signal's fluctuating here. Hello! - Hello? Hello! I'll call you back. Bye Uh-oh! Gents restroom! Looks like someone is in the toilet for long! Don't crowd here Dude, take turns one after the other! Not together! You guys must be put in priso... Please! Please! Sorry I plead you. Please don't embarrass me Firestick, invites you for... Dude, call up this number Sorry! I was on a call and walked in without realizing Dude, it's your number! I told you to write it down in that restroom! Why did you write it here? - There was no space on the wall there - So? You'll write it here? Doofus! Dude, come on! Hey Tortoise head! Damn it! You shameless! Now, let's go! You just spoiled my mood to pee! You carry on! What's with you and that girl? Coming out at the same time from the restroom! Nothing! Dude, Trisha looked better in 'Endru endrum punnagai' movie than this! But the hero in it looked just 'okay' Are you a Santhanam fan? Thanks! Why did she just thank you? "Oh Vasuki, please come with me" - Hey! - Hi! - How are you? - I'm fine What are you doing here? To this temple. I come here every Friday at 5:30 - Every Friday? - Yes But today's...Monday, Tuesday... - No! No! Daily 5:30 - Oh! Daily 5:30? At 5:30? Ok! Ok! "Even if the branch grows out and touches the sky, the roots still cling on to the ground" "Even if I am away, my thoughts are always with and about you" "What do I call this never ending desire?" "Feels like a ball of fire has swirled me up but I don't see any smoke or feel any burns" "My heart keeps skipping a beat" "My heart keeps skipping a beat" "The heart wants you! It's desperate!" "The heart wants you! It's desperate!" "My heart keeps skipping a beat" "The heart wants you! It's desperate!" Vasuki! "Oh Vasuki, please come with me" "Your eyes have stolen my heart! You've swept me off my feet!" "My heart keeps skipping a beat" "The heart wants you!" "Time spent with you everyday..." "has changed my world! It's a whole new exciting one" "My heart was strong and brave" "But the moment I lay my eyes on you it become nervous" "All I want to do is be with you" "I have now lost the track of time" "Oh dear, henceforth I can't live without you" "When you are around, I am never alone" "The moment your fragrance takes over me..." "I feel something inside of me" "Oh Vasuki, please come with me" "Your eyes have stolen my heart! You've swept me off my feet!" "What do I call this never ending desire?" "Feels like a ball of fire has swirled me up but I don't see any smoke or feel any burns" "My heart keeps skipping a beat" "The heart wants you! It's desperate!" "Oh Vasuki, please come with me" What about a photo of your mother? Don't you feel like seeing her? My brother is here, right? What will you do when you feel like seeing her? My brother has come up with an idea for that My mother's kitchen. He brings me here Traditional kitchen reminds us of our mother - Ok, see you then - See you Take care of Ilakya. This is very critical time for her Don't roam around. I'll call you everyday Tell me once she delivers the child. I'll come down at once! - Ok. Muah! I love you - Ok? Bye! - Bye! - Bye! Bid her good bye properly I did! I said so because the bus will halt for a food break - Some other guy will woo her then! - You! Situation is getting worse day by day Let him and he'll bury us alive! Put to an end to his channel for once and for all! Call up that advocate! Everyday I'm losing one or the other thing because of him! Last month the marriage hall and yesterday, this factory! Wonder what I'll lose tomorrow! Yet why haven't you taken any action? He is a stranger to nobody here! He has connections from Mayavaram to Thiruvaroor If this continues... then people will gossip that MLASingaram is a wuss! Chief! Did you threaten to ruin my friend, Senthil's business if he doesn't suck up to you? Told you chief is a sucker! Oh come on! Be nice to him Chief, he's my friend. I don't have any brother and you know it If I had an elder brother and if he had a problem, I'd have inquired what happened If it was a younger brother I'd ask if he created any problem? But a problem for a friend means I'll start dealing it by chopping off the enemy's head! Because for me my friends are my life! What say, buddy? Fine but what problem do you got with me? Enough is enough! You better stop! I've lost enough because of you! So, don't mess with me and lose the one and only thing dear to you Sister! Chief... too old school! Didn't scare me at all! Say something that's in trend and can scare me. Like some ghost plot Of late even ghosts in ghost plots are very funny When did the spat between us begin? You wanted to buy out my cable connection business and I refused You played dirty games to snatch it from me Later you became a victim of my dirty games! If you hadn't disturbed me, I'd have carried on with my horoscope show daily morning... and 'the secret of the nights' show in the night. I'd have minded my own business Chief... do you think I don't about the dirty games you still play to bring me down? Politicians are too good at messing with and turning others into politician Please don't turn me too into a politician Look at him! You! Aren't you educated enough? Talk some sense into him He looks educated to you? It sounds like "Grannies turned into models in a land with no youths" This comedy didn't work out! Wait! I have a better one - Your jokes suck! - Don't leave me! I'll go home and message you that joke! Ok dude! Chief, remember I have a connection in Courtallam We have established our business there too Go there and you can get entertained! Bye chief! Love you! Sir, very dangerous fellow! He is waiting for the right moment to strike What will you give me if I remove him from your path? I know a thug. He won't look at a person's photo before murdering He murders first and then confirms it with the photo! If you find an apt person who can finish him off... then I'll pay whatever he demands! I'll set him up! So? You betrayed us, isn't it? Look I might have but I will never stab you guys or anyone in the back Don't show off that everyone of us follows you I just got the phone number promising you'll do it If I had got the photo and details, I'd have done it myself! You think you can murder by just looking at the person's photo? So if the person is tall and muscular, you'll take men with you... and if he's short and weak, you'll do it yourself. Is this your strategy? Remember, Hitler was ye height! Didn't the whole world fear him? Height and weight of the person doesn't matter You must read the person's mind first And you say you'll do it by just seeing the target's photo? My foot! So, what's your concept? Like, first provoke the target over a call then decide on whether to finish him off or not? Confusing! You guys won't understand if I tell you. Let me show it Give me his number She asks for a 'Dark Fantasy' cookie in a local tea shop "Marry off a girl a little young and it'll keep playing with it's toys!" You! Come here Would you like a tea? No, seriously. That's the proverb! "it keeps playing..." - Shut up! I'll finish you off - You're thinking like a pervert! Hello A tea for him! Who was that? What did I do now? You called him up and abused him What would you do if a stranger does this to you? I'll call him back and abuse him like he has never been abused before! If he does the same... then he is a dummy! A nothing! You can finish him off yourself But if he calls back and goes like this... 'Hello, sir. I got a call from this number. Who is this? Someone abused me' "But why? For what?" If he deals in such a calm manner... then he is a sharp fellow! It means he has a clear mind Not 10, even 100 of you go and still you can't do anything! Call him back, give it to me and I'll abuse him real bad! - Let's all abuse him! Come on! - Listen you pot head! Someone had an issue and he called up the wrong number by mistake It's a new number and I have never heard this voice Crystal clear, it was Chennai slang. He's showing it off to me? I don't recollect having any foes in Chennai Dude... order a tea for me What's running in your mind? If this call was not meant for me... then he won't even call back to apologize If it was meant for me... then he'll call me again, for sure! You! Would you like some fritters? Confirmed, the call's meant for me Hey! He disconnected the call Now, he'll call back for sure! What now? Are you gonna call back and ask his details in a polite way? No See that? It's him Either he will talk Or he'll let a police or his advocate do the talking A single 'Hello' from him and I'll tell you his height, weight, color and color of his eyes Start music! (Group of old ladies abusing) Enough! Enough! Ok! Ok! Enough! Please! Enough! He's a little kid. Don't abuse his family That turned out to be really funny! Manimaran from Mayavaram here Malli speaking! Speak and I'll listen Go ahead! Speak! Then hear me out! 7th day from today, you will lie chopped into pieces in your place! I just called to tell you that Ok - When are you coming down? - Listen! This is 'Vysarpadi' Malli! I asked you, when are you coming down? Hope you have my address Come down and call me What's up Malli, sir? So, who was he? Hitler or Charlie Chaplin? You see both of them look similar Same style of moustache too! So please enlighten us Which was the place? He is an outsider and threatens to kill me He knows my complete details I want to know everything about him. He said he'll be here in 7 days I'm sure he'll reach Mayavaram in 7 hours! Pondicherry, Kadaloor, Chidambaram, Sirkali Tell me We are looking at the railway station. We'll keep you posted They won't turn up there - I'll call you back - Ok buddy! Ok! What is it, brother? You look very tensed up What's with so many calls? Isn't your girlfriend visiting you? Any problem? Are you guys planning to elope? Oh come on, little sister Do bid me good bye if you're eloping Dear! Don't laugh so hard! Hello, tell me Buddy... I came here and checked on based on a lead from Dhana Remember this old rail gate? In a toddy shop near it, I see an Omni van with Madras registration number The men also seem very peculiar and their slang also sounds fishy What do we do? Buddy, don't move! Stay right there I'll be there in 5 minutes. Ok? - Don't move! Stay right there! I'll be there - Ok dude Where are you going at this hour? Dear, did you take your medicine? - I had them - The tonic?

Here for a shoot at Kumbakonam We just stopped by for some authentic toddy - We are not here to create any trouble, sir - Yes, sir Come on, guys 'Mayiladuthurai' He had a completely different tone He won't waste time, drinking! Fine... - My sister is alone at home. See you - Ok dude Remember, you must not get fits attack when the labour pain kicks in And the labour pain must not occur when you have a fits attack If both occurs at the same time... This brother wants both, you and your child. Got it? Brother! He'll do a clean job, right? He is a mad dog! Once he decides to murder... he won't back down until he draws blood If he doesn't get hold of the target... he ends up butchering even street dogs Dear! Little sister! Ilakya! Ilakya! Hello? Buddy, what happened? Quick, turn around! 23 years, buddy! For 23 years I took care of her and that too all for this very moment Like... if anyone has a problem and all they got to do is make one call! I'll be there but when it came to my sister... Poor thing! Wonder how she came here and what all struggle she had to go through Oh God! Our friend, Saravanan! Her husband! How will I face him? If something happens to her, what will I answer him? - Dude, calm down - Calm down, nothing will happen to her Wonder what struggles she had to go through How did she manage to come here?

Before he rats me out, I'll finish him off Then why did the guy, who came, save Malli instead of finishing him off?

Girls or Boys?' 'This becomes the hot topic every year when the exam results are announced' Every one has at least one enemy in their life But it's us, who decide the time we encounter our enemy But Pavithra's enemy was hiding in her dreams All the press media is here Come, let's interview the state topper Pavi, go ahead, talk! Come on, say something! Once, near my home, a dog gave birth to puppies Once, near my home, a dog gave birth to 10 puppies 10 beautiful puppies People around came in and took away the puppies one by one But only one puppy was left stranded on the streets Me and my grandpa saved it before any vehicle ran over it That's when I asked my grandpa... Why did people leave this puppy alone stranded? Grandpa replied that all the puppies taken were male This one's a female puppy hence nobody wants it I asked "Grandpa, wasn't it a female dog that delivered all the puppies?" He replied "Male puppies grow up and guard the house where as female dogs wander around" I adopted that female puppy I trained it All those male puppies only guarded their master's house But my puppy grew up and guarded the whole town! You must have read about her in a magazine last month That's my pet Awesome Pavi! So females are no lesser than males even in dogs! Men and women are equal! They have same power! Sounds good, sir? Superb, Pavithra! You're very bold! So, what's your future plan? What are you going to study? What next? I want to become a lawyer Criminal lawyer! Dear, you have scored centum in Physics! Tamizh, English, Maths etc. leave all of them Scoring centum in Physics is not an easy task I expected you'll say you will become a scientist and work in NASA... instead you wanna become a lawyer? Our country is going down the drains and what will change if go to NASA? We can't keep pondering that the government and it's official are not functioning properly This is our land and we must take care of it ourselves! That is why... But what's advocate profession got to do with it? Simple, only when the system and it's rules are strict, the country will develop Confused? Strict punishments! We keep boasting about foreign countries and how we can't break rules there Guess why? Because their rules and regulations are very strict A rapist is beheaded in front of a huge crowd But here? We can't even chop off a finger of any criminal The God can only decide the punishment To ensure the right person, confirmed to his initials, gets that punishment... can only be done by a lawyer! Here the wages and punishment always finds the wrong person! It must reach the correct person Such a rage at this age. Do you really need to worry so much? My anger is reasonable and justified. You guys find it amusing, isn't it? I'm not surprised After all, all of your rage and anger are now like antiques in museum Where's all your anger? You vent it out by honking at the poor load pulling labours on the road Or worst come, you vent it out in social media as a mere post! Do you expect your anger will result to something? It will, for sure! There are many pending cases that drive me crazy and won't just let me sleep Allow me and I'll fight them right from tomorrow I'm desperate and eager to wear the advocate uniform You have just completed your 12th grade. There is still a long way to reach there Where do you think you can collect evidence and pointers for these pending cases? Why would I have to look for it when you all are here? How many press are functioning here? Around 230 All these 230 press report the same news but in their own unique way Each of you have different way of telling the same story! That's all I need to collect evidences and pointer. I have stored them in bundles - Which cases are you talking about? - Well, there are hundreds Name a few important ones out of those Gang rape by minister's son and his friends The suicide committed by 6 girls in a medical college owned by a big shot in Tamizh Nadu The saint Lord of modern era in Tamizh Nadu... The mysterious hermitage case Do you've any idea who is dealing those cases? Especially the accused one's background in those cases Guess who is the lawyer fighting for them? The Ashok Mithran! #1 Criminal lawyer! You keep singing praises of such people and never let anyone fight or rise! Isn't it? Someone raises voice and you'll kick them down with your words. Isn't it? Ashok Mithran! You call him an advocate? Pity that, people who lick boots and dance to others' tunes are called advocate these days We only have ourselves to blame for it Now, we must rise and change everything What an energetic young girl! "We are the sharp minds that can bring about change with non violence" "We are swords that will shed blood to win our war" "We aren't angels merely because of our soft bodies" "But because we question even the saint to serve justice" "I'll trounce tyranny with my arguments and make the sinner bow in front of me" "I need the black uniform to save the fair lady of justice" "The women will soon rule and the advocate uniform will become my identity" I'll wear the advocate coat and meet everyone in the court!

Our men have gone to her village - Hello - What's happening there Ashok? - Sir... - This is my son's future! If something goes awry then you will... - You will suffer! Remember that! - Sir, just... If the case becomes a news then... - Sir, she's just a 12th grade student! - I don't want her to speak! Our people crowd even if 10 crows crow together! We could've handled if it were boys But now, it's a girl Is Shankar home? He has stepped out Where is Pavithra's house, the girl who secured state 1st? That's her house No, sir Forget it It's risky if we do it here Not just that. She is always surrounded by 10 girls all the time Name: Pavithra Age: 17 years old Her parents are no more Only relative is her grandfather When she was in 7th , she had a fall from the giant wheel during a festive season She had a head injury and was in comatose for 6 months and 18 days She became brilliant after that injury. She was always the school topper from there on Right from her hair color to her toe nail polish... Ask everything to be sponsored to her, at once Pity that, people who lick boots and dance to others' tunes are called advocate these days News spread that all the cases Pavithra mentioned will be re-opened by the Delhi high court That news shook the whole foundation of Ashok Mithran's firm - Whose mail is it? - Someone called Manimaran from Mayavaram He has sent me Rs. 5000 insisting that my first advocate uniform coat should come from him Really? Hey Pavi, come out and check this out Desire! Every business today in the world runs on the desires of the poor Everything that he sponsored reached her Tickets to a theme park in Chennai was also a part of it No arguments! We are taking Pavithra to Chennai! Hey Pavi, come let's go in! Everyone has the right to dream But your dream shouldn't interfere and crush my dreams Nice to meet you Pavithra A voice from the crowd... shouted out that a girl fell off from the giant wheel Senior, this is your grand daughter's autopsy report The press is waiting outside, go out and show this to them... and explain her death to them They will keep twisting their questions. Just read out the report! What's written in the report It's written that yesterday your granddaughter got drunk and high What? Looks like she had too many... Is it so? - No! - Yesterday, here... along with 3 boys... Please! She is no more! I'm not saying it. Her medical report says so Just read out the truth. Now, get up Sir, what happened to Pavithra? My granddaughter? When she was in the 7th grade... she took the giant wheel ride when she was out on a school trip She fell from it and hurt her head very bad She was in comatose for a year After that she was afraid of the giant wheel But yesterday... she tried to overcome her fear and again took the giant wheel ride She again fell from it and died! He wrote our destiny He decided what we should say What's the problem, dear? The main problem is here that she secured the state first rank in 12th grade! People like us getting educated is a big issue here! Stop! Hey! Can't you hear me? Where are you going? To home! For what? - I'll go - To where? To Chennai! Why? We took her to Chennai Now, look! I don't get you She doesn't deserve this. Look what they did to her! Why and how did this happen to her? Who did it? We know the answers to everything! Yet we are here, just weeping and mourning for her! Not even a single press channel bothered to turn up What are you going to do for Pavithra? We are even ready to sacrifice ourselves! I don't want you worth-less life! Money! How much money can you guys shell out? - Tell me, how much can you give? - Tell us! How much do you need? Give it to me! Come, on. Give it! What are you going to do with this? When boys have a problem don't their friends huddle up and fight for them? If the same happens to us, why should we sit at home and weep! We must also fight back! - Yes! - Indeed! We must finish him off! We must do something about this! Pavithra said, females are no lesser than males even in dogs! We must prove it! Then what are you all waiting for! Come on! Let's go! 'Chennai High Court' The court was wired with cameras all around There was no one to help us But the only thing that helped us that day was rain After every case, no matter how much the press questions... Ignoring them is Ashok Mithran's usual reply We decided that what we were gonna do that day could be the first of more to come Run! Hey! Someone in the crowd stabbed Mithran sir! Run! Run! Who stabbed him? No one's here - Come on - Let's check over there It is said that it is easy to escape using the loop holes in the law and order Similarly we found a small way out to escape from the court premises Malli! Anybody there? No one's here. Search over there! Amidst that group full of beasts... we saw a person who turned into a kind human at that very moment Go! His name is Malli That is all we know about him Why did he help us and didn't rat us out? We started looking for him to find answers We decided to ask his help We finally found him out But we couldn't talk to him in person We managed to get his mobile number We told him about us and our story Do you have the last month edition of Junior Vikatan? What's up with him? Let me go, check Since that issue at court, he seems to be double minded Isn't it? He promised to meet all of us in person Whom do we approach for help if we have to lock horns with such a big shot? Thought we'll ask our families to help us but the situation will only make the stop us If she had a brother, he would have fought for her But she has nobody like that Her friends; us, isn't it us who must step up? That what's we did! We stepped up! We stabbed him! He was lucky, the first time You must have read about it in the flash news and as heading in the papers "Murder attempt on popular advocate Ashok Mithran" That was us! Malli promised to meet us We called him from the local booth but we felt something was fishy Whom do we trust? We don't have an option but to depend on someone We did trust someone but got busted Brother... do you have a sister? I do have a sister Please let go of us considering us as your sisters We have no idea about who are you You saved us from them... but don't know what you'll do to us We have no idea, whom to trust That's is why told you our story Expecting you'll spare us showing some mercy Here, please have this All we ask is please don't rat us out Someone called Manimaran from Mayavaram He has sent me Rs. 5000 insisting that my first advocate uniform coat should come from him Girls are being victimized in the railway station, bus stand and crowded places A single person from the crowd has never saved any such victimized girls There was never such a headline in papers In Maharashra, when a girl was murdered, a cow intervened and tried to save her In Mylapore, when a one sided lover stabbed a girl, a dog came to her rescue But the humans? All they do is just be a bystander! It is said that such bystanders are the reason why our nation is going down the drains We didn't want to go to such bystanders and beg them for help! Hereafter, bystanders will remain bystanders! Because we'll also stab back and even then bystanders must keep quiet! No one meets anyone in this world without a reason All I wish for... and all I desire is... is my younger sister's welfare A selfishness that nothing good must happen without my presence I wasn't there on the day I must have been there for her That one day... Malli stole it completely from me I even cursed God that day! Now, I have a clear understanding He saved my only sister But... I have a task here to save 10 of my sisters! Well... God doesn't test us without a reason First and foremost, an applause and hats off to you all! If everyone in every town stands up and fight like you then on will dare to attack you Aren't you all here for your friend? I too am here for my friend. Malli is my friend! Dears... here, not only bulls have horns! Even deers have horns! Use them and their horns too will pierce through and draw blood! They don't realize your power Brother, can we trust you? Call me a brother and my eyes will tear up You all have told me your issue considering me as your brother Do you think I'll let go of them so easy? Brother! Please don't beat him! Please no! Please don't hurt him! Please don't beat him! No! Please! Dear brother! How dare you pose as a cop? That too using my walkie! Drag him! My dears! Don't panic! You can even lose a battle to your enemy... but for even a moment do not lose the battle with yourself Do not let your self confidence die! Shut up! You were born only after fighting and defeating millions of cells! Your life started by winning! Do not depend or trust anyone else! You are your only savior! Don't think! Thoughts are tricky! It'll take the side of both good and evil! Do what your heart says, even if it is wrong! Everything will fall in place automatically! Don't think too much, my dears! Prabhu, tell them to drop off Malli and that girl at the location I say Ok, sir Sir, please let me explain. Sir... Don't you dare try trick us or else... The department have given me the permission take any action against you Please, sir. Just hear me out for 2 minutes. Please! - Keep quiet - Sir, this is a different issue Yes, dear A small issue last night A guy stole my walkie talkie Sir, actually I didn't steal Like I'm gonna believe that! Caught the accused. The DGP has asked me to meet him. I'm on my way What? You guys just won't understand! What do you mean? The whole Tamizh Nadu is waiting to witness our end But none has the guts to finish us off It's embarrassing to tell everyone that these girls stabbed me! That's what I want! Your dream is on a whole different level! Hello. Tell me, Ravi Break his knees... Help is like a mole on your back It cannot be seen but it is considered lucky! Keep helping others and it'll come back to us one day Tell me, how can I help you and I'll do it That was our brother who made you break your phone! Do you guys have his photo? I want to see him! You wanna see him? You'll soon be just a memory in a photo! Because he'll be here soon! How many of our men are here? - 12 of us, boss - 12? Not enough. 12 is nothing! 12 of us but each of our hand is equal to a man That makes 24 men! Can we manage to at least stab him once? Malli! Hey, it's me... Hey, it's me, Mayavaram Manimaran! Remember, you promised to kill me! Look here! Here! I thought I'll hang out with you and have a cup of tea Son of a gun! Well, stop pulling my leg now I did a small favor after all... and instead you almost sacrificed yourself for me Look at him! Did you take us for Facebook friend who'll just stop with likes? A real friend puts his/her life on the line for friends! Oops! Ok! Ok An almond milk for our boy here! See that saami? Whole Tamil Nadu will hear it. Isn't it?
