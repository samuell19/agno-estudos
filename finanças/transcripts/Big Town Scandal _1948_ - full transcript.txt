Let's go quick. Pinky, Pinky, no. Basketball things, that's all. OK. Hey, Tom! Get Dum Dum down! Come on, let's go! Let's go! Hand this up. Let's go. Come on, Dum Dum. Hand it up one. Don't lose that sock. Oh, oh. All right. Better come down peacefully. Would you leave me alone? Listen, I've been looking all over town for you. I need bail bond for my cousin. Well, can you get the bank before ten o'clock? I ain't open for business yet. Morning, Louie. Out all night? You are just a kid, and where's Lorelei? Making three phone calls. Got anything good? Now listen. I may not be as pretty as Lorelei, but "The Chronicle" has a much bigger circulation. Not according to the latest figures. Speaking of figures... Sometimes I wonder why I keep on working for him. Hello, Louie. Lorelei, I gotta talk to you. [INAUDIBLE] for the junior chamber of commerce. Put a firecracker under [INAUDIBLE] Quincy. Lorelei, listen. Junior chamber of commerce. 22. 342 Elm, [INAUDIBLE]. I'm sorry Louie. What's on your mind? Those kids that were picked up robbing that sporting goods store last night... you can't print that story. Wrong department, Louie. I only do what Steve tells me to in 4,000 or 5,000 words. If you lay off, maybe "The Chronicle" will play ball too. You haven't got a chance with Steve. You know he's death on juvenile delinquency. Lorelei, you just gotta talk to him, you gotta! Why the interest, Louie? None of those kids are good for a bail bond. One of them's my nephew, Frankie. Oh, I'm sorry Louie. But Steve thinks bad boys belong in reform school. Sure. That's what makes real crooks out of them. Come on over to Judge Hogan's chambers with me. I want you to meet those kids. They're not bad, none of them! But I just got through telling you what Steve expects me to do today. I'm late for the Benson trial right now. Won't take long. Give me a break, will you? I gave you plenty. You've been swell about tipping me off to stories Louie, but I... Oh, please, Lorelei. OK. Steve calls, I'll be in Judge Hogan's chambers. What are you, a frustrated mother? Ah, crawl back in the woodwork. Uh, how's that again? Pst. We'll plead guilty. Get it over with. I don't want to go to reform school. What's the matter with you? You scared? What do you mean? We ain't going to go to reform school. Wait till Uncle Louie gets here. He'll fix up everything. Quiet, boys. Uh huh. Caught stealing sporting goods. Parents here in court? None of these boys live with parents, Your Honor. Tommy Malone lives with a cousin, Jim Malone, who's a laborer and he can't take the day off. Ms. Dale Peters is here, Harold's sister. Johnny Jones, known as Pinky, has a grandmother who is bedridden. It would be cruel to ask her to come here. What you balling about? If it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't be in this jam. Why don't you shut up, Frankie, and leave Pinky alone? Waldo Riggs is a deaf and dumb boy living alone, but he seems quite capable of taking care of himself. As for Frankie Snead, he has an uncle well known to this court who is quite able to take care of his nephew, financially at least. Smart guy. Hey fellas. Everything's set. My uncle Louie's here now. We'll be sprung any time. Quiet. Your Honor, all of these boys are first offenders. I would suggest that they be given probation. Your Honor? Yes? I'm the owner of the store these hoodlums robbed, and I'm sick and tired of mollycoddling young gangsters! You a frustrated mother too? No, I'm a frustrated messenger boy delivering a message from [INAUDIBLE]. I'm managing editor. Judge Hogan? Yes, Mr. Blake? I know that this is an informal hearing here in your chambers and that you'd like to hear all the viewpoints on the matter. - May I speak for my paper? - Go right ahead. Well, sir, "The Chronicle" feels that these boys should be sent to reform school, and will say so editorially. There's been a crime wave here in Big Town recently, and well, my paper feels the only way to handle it is to, well, nip the thing in the bud by punishing young [INAUDIBLE]. Your Honor. Yes Ms. Kilbourne? "The Illustrated Press" disagrees. These boys are entitled to probation. Boys sent to reform school often return to prison as hardened criminals. Ordinarily they would be given probation. But unfortunately, they have no one to whom they can be paroled. I'm afraid I must hold them for sentence. Would you parole these boys if a reputable citizen of Big Town would accept responsibility for them? Is such a citizen present and willing to do so? Your Honor, these boys must be punished! Please Judge. Give me five minutes. A little irregular, Ms. Kilbourne, but, uh, we'll continue in five minutes. Everybody rise. This had better be good. Mr. Wilson, I... Steve. Lorelei, what is all this? Everybody rise. The hearing has resumed. Sit down. Now about that story. Ms. Kilbourne, we can go on now if you're prepared. Your Honor, Steve Wilson, managing editor of "The Illustrated Press." Your Honor. Mr. Wilson. You are the citizen Ms. Kilbourne sent for? Yes. Mr. Wilson, you're a credit to the community. These boys will be paroled in your custody. You'll receive the papers for signing tomorrow. Boys? Custody? What's he talking about? The story I phoned about. Thank you, Your Honor, for your splendid handling of the case. The hearing is adjourned. Everybody rise. Lorelei, what the devil's going on here? You heard the judge, you're a credit to the community. Thanks a lot, Mr. Wilson. Congratulations, Steve. Thanks a lot, Mr. Wilson. I appreciate it. Thanks, Goldilocks. I told you my uncle Louie would fix everything. Uncle Louie'll fix it! Go on home and wash the dishes. All right. Now be quiet and tell me, what was all that about? Those boys were arrested last night and given probation, providing a prominent citizen would be responsible for them. You're the prominent citizen. Yes, I know but... no, no, no. No, no. It's a rip. Tell me it's a rip. Nothing of the kind. Well Lorelei, I'm not going probation for those young hoodlums! Judge Hogan asked you and you said yes in front of a court full of witnesses. Do you want to be held in contempt? -Why, it's ridiculous! What are you trying to do? Make me... make me the laughing stock of Big Town? Why, even when you called, I was dictating an editorial stating that for the first time, we were [INAUDIBLE] with "The Chronicle." Why don't you ask me about those boys instead of condemning them without a hearing liked "The Chronicle?" Do you know their offense? Do you know what they were trying to steal? Sporting goods, just so they could have a basketball team. Why, there are half a dozen organizations with... with free gyms in Big Town. Why do those kids have to be thieves? Those organizations don't want street boys. They want nice, clean little boys from nice, clean homes. What do you want me to do? [INAUDIBLE] them? I want you to use your head. You've got a big story and you don't see it. Besides, you'll be doing some real good. What story? Oh, Steve, let me spell it for you. "'The Illustrated Press' Builds Better Boys." "'The Illustrated..." Oh, Lorelei! I love you! Yes, what a story! Sure I see it! Let "The Chronicle" yap about sending delinquents to... to reform school. Our newspaper will give them another chance, a chance to make good. Sure! Oh boy, what a story! "'The Illustrated Press' Builds Better Boys." Get it? Write an editorial proving that the present system of handling delinquents has its defects. Show up "The Chronicle." Campaigning against homeless kids just to build circulation. Start it this way: "The Illustrated Press" is proud to report that Judge Hogan of the juvenile court has paroled the following youngsters to his custody. Right, Curly Locks? Right. So Steve Wilson wants a battle, does he? Well, "The Chronicle" will take the wind out of his sails. Here, take down this editorial. Finding its circulation steadily declining, one of our competitors... just, uh... a question mark after competitors... just as a cheap newspaper trick... Will coddle a group of young delinquents caught breaking into a store. This is ambitious an editorial as "The Chronicle" has ever printed. I'm only the publisher of this paper, but, uh, is it in order for me to ask a question? Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry. Of course, Mr. Peabody. And what was the idea of getting into this crusade? And what are you going to do about it? Well, we honestly feel we want to help these boys get a fresh start in life. First thing, you'd better get them jobs. News boys, copy boys, anything as long as it's honest work. Oh, that's a cinch. But when they're not working, we've got to keep them off the streets. I know. A recreation center. Yes, that's it! A recreation center. "The Illustrated Press" Recreation Center. The citizens of Big Town contribute to the rehabilitation of the boys. We could raise half a million dollars. Put a big thermometer in front of the building. Now wait a minute, gentlemen. Do that and "The Chronicle" will really ride us. This is our job, not just another charity drive. And would you kindly tell me how we're going to build a recreation center without financial help? Just a moment, all of you. You're floundering around like a bunch of fish in a net. Mary. Mr. Peabody, I've worked for this paper for 40 years now. I brought up three generations of youngins in the streets of Big Town. Maybe I got a right to talk. I'll says she has. And we fish had better listen. Go on, Mary. Now listen. You remember where "The... The... The... Illustrated Press" started in the old building, the other side of town? Yes. Well, we still own the building, don't we? Corporation still owns it. Well, what's wrong with turning that over for a... a recreation center for the lads? Oh, Mary. Ah, you're a gem. An emerald from the [INAUDIBLE], huh? Oh, I was born in Brooklyn, Mr. Wilson. Tommy, you have a bad habit of hacking. Remember, you... you grab the ball, not your opponent's wrist. OK? OK. Dum Dum. You can read my lips, can't you? Naturally you can't hear the whistle? Maybe we'd better make you a substitute, huh? Well, we're apt to get into serious trouble in a real game. You've got to put Dum Dum on a regular team, Mr. Wilson. He's the best guard we got. Yes, I know, but the whistle, Tommy. Well, don't worry about that. When we hear the whistle we'll quit playing, and we'll signal to Dum Dum like this, OK? OK, you're the captain. Come on boys. [INAUDIBLE]. Steve Wilson, the all American boy. He's the first managing editor everybody I ever met who knew anything about sports. He loves every minute of it. Did you get enough pictures? Used every plate. Plenty of Steve in them? Oh, Steve and the basketball just like that. Good boy, you'll get a raise. Nothing like a sweater to bring out the ham in a man, is there? I wouldn't know. My wife never wears them. Good boy! Steve, this is a good thing you're doing. But you know, we've put ourselves in a ticklish position. If the boys back... Don't you worry, A.P., they're a fine bunch of boys. They'll work out all right. And in another week, I'll have them a first class team. Good. Well, I'm glad I remember a thing or two about basketball. Gave them a pretty good workout, if I say so myself. Can I feel your muscle, Coach? How about lunch, eh? Good enough, but, uh, no carrot juice and spinach. You won't have to. Be with you in five minutes. Swell car, isn't it? Hello Marion. Yeah, it sure is. Joe's isn't it? Mm hmm. -All right. Come on, kids. Beat it. Joe won't like you hanging around his car. Come on, come on. Let's go. Get in. Oh, I'd better not, Tommy. Joe won't like it. Now look. Joe's a pal of mine. He won't mind. Get in. It's all right. Well, let's have some music. Now look. Stop worrying. Relax and enjoy the music. Gosh, that's pretty. Yeah. Tommy? Yeah? Think you'll ever have a car like this? Oh, sure, only better. You and me will take a trip up to the Bear Mountain. Oh, it's beautiful up there. Yeah. We'll park way up on that high road and look way down on that river underneath us. We'll see the pines at night with the moon sitting right on top. Oh, it's wonderful. Yeah. It ain't a bad job. Well, you don't have to rush out, baby. My mother's waiting. Not a bad looking pigeon. Yours? Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]. Hey, it's a sweet car. When you get it? Pretty classy, huh? Yeah. Hey, which way you going Joe? Downtown. Want a lift? Yeah, I was just going down there myself. You know what? A car like this, Joe, you ought to have to chauffeur. You want to drive, huh? OK. - See how she feels. - All right. Thanks Joe. Thanks a lot. Cops. Better slow down. No, keep going. This car is hot. Hot? Step on it, I got a rap hanging over me. What do you think I've got? Furs! Pst! Tommy. Hey Tommy. Been waiting for you, kid. How'd you know I'd show up? Those cops could have got me. Not a smart kid like you. What's on your mind, Joe? What happened to the car? I stashed it. Good. Let's go get it. Hold up, Joe. I took a lot of changes with that car. Well, sure I know you did, Tommy, but I had to scram. They'd have caught me, I'd have gone up for a stretch. Well, what about me? I'm on probation! They would have been tougher with me. I know why, Joe. What do you mean? I told you the car was hot. That ain't all. You looked in the back. You know, that's a nice load of furs. Oh, listen you... Don't try that, Joe. OK Tommy. Where'd you hide the car? I'll take you there, but first we got to settle something. What? My cut. Your cut? You heard me. I'll talk to the boys about it. No Joe. You'll talk to me about it right now. You're getting a little big for your britches. Maybe. All right. You're in. Now let's get the car. Thanks, Joe. And my gang uses the upstairs for a gym. Nobody ever comes in here. Perfect, huh? I got to hand it to you, Tommy. It's a good drop for hot goods. Kind of gives me an idea. I know just what you're thinking, Joe. Yeah, I guess you do, Tommy. You're pretty hip. You cut me in and I'll get you an extra key. A deal. You keep your eyes open, let me know when they bring in a load, and you'll make a few bucks for yourself. That suits me. Lovely costume you're wearing, Mr. W. Oh, you like that, huh? That was something he picked up in the comment section. Press box comedians kill me. I'll weigh you three to one on the Big Shots. Are you kidding? Young Scrubs ain't got a chance. Well, five to one, just to make it interesting. OK, [INAUDIBLE]. But no more. Some boy I got there. Yeah, and me making a sucker bet. He'll make it back for you. Plenty more. Uh, nice gentle bunch of boys you've got there, Lorelei. Come on, Frankie! See what I mean? I, uh, beg your pardon, lady. Where would I find Mr. Malone? Mr. Malone? -Yes, uh, Thomas R. Malone. [INAUDIBLE]. That's Tommy. Oh... oh, in the dressing room in there. Thank you. Thank you very much. And if [INAUDIBLE] diamonds, watches, knickknacks, just call on Smiley Charlie Kaye. That's me. Smiling Charlie. Just like it says there. Thank you. Uh, Mr. Malone. Huh, Malone? Oh. Hey Tommy. There's a duck out here to see you. Duck? Uh, Mr. Malone? Yeah, that's me. Smiling Charlie Kaye. Joe made an appointment. Oh yeah, about the [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah. Marion, come here. Uh, this is my girlfriend, Marion. Mr. Kaye. How do you do? I'm sure. And a beautiful girl needs a beautiful watch. And Smiling Charlie's got them. Oh, they're wonderful. Take your pick. Oh, no. You pick it. Look, it's your birthday, and I want you to pick it. Well, all right. How about this one? A genuine, gold filled, seven jeweled [INAUDIBLE]. Uh, try it on for size. How much is it? Well, anybody else, $35. But you're a friend of Joe's, and Joe's a friend of mine. Never mind. It's not good enough. Oh, Tommy. Look, I want you to have the best. Now what's the best watch you got in that thing? Well, there's a beauty. No finer timepiece made anyplace, even though you hear different. Diamonds. Now there's a smart girl, Mr. Malone. Those real genuine diamonds one you sees them. And there they are, 18 beautiful chips. How much is it? Well, it's been an off season. You know Joe, Joe's a friend of mine. He sent me over. How much? Cash? What do you think? $165? Good deal. Say that's, uh, $200. You owe me $35 bucks. Ah, that makes us even, Mr. Malone. Exercise tax. Exercise? Sure, I've been running around all day. Look, I've been running around too. $35 bucks. Oh. Can't fool you, can I, Mr. Malone? You sure tried, didn't you? -Well, there you are. $10, $20, $30, $35. And with every tick of that watch, you should have happiness. And if you ever need any more jewelry, diamonds, watches, knickknacks, just call on Smiling Charlie Kaye. OK? We, good luck folks. Have fun. You like it? Oh, it's wonderful Tommy. I don't think you should. Look, it's your birthday. I want you to be happy. Now come on. Oh, Steve. Hello, Tommy. This is my girl Marion. Ms., uh, Harrison, I'd like to take the pleasure to introduce Mr. Wilson, Ms. Kilbourne. Hello. How do you do? Hey Lorelei, did you know that Steve is getting out of coaching? No, Steve. Well now, I can't coach the team and run the paper properly. You know that. And who takes the coaching job? The guy they should have had in the first place, the sports editor. Well, it'll be OK. Beautiful watch, Ms. Harrison. Yeah, I just got it for her birthday. Look, we got a little stepping to do yet. Goodnight Steve, Lorelei. Goodnight. Goodnight. Where'd he get all that money? Selling papers, of course. Well, I'm going to find out. How about stopping by the [INAUDIBLE] for a cup of coffee? Coffee? Tommy takes his girl stepping. OK, I'll buy you two cup. Come on. Hi Steve. You want to see me? Yeah, come in, Tommy. Come in. Sit down. Thanks a lot. Breaking training? Oh, a cigarette once in a while don't hurt. You mind if I see that case? No, sure. Thanks. Very nifty. Yeah. Yeah. It's all right. Oh thanks. Tommy, where are you getting the money? What money? You know what money. To buy cigarette cases and clothes and presents for your girl. Where are you getting it? OK, Mr. Wilson. I'm betting on the Big Shots. Aren't you getting on the gravy train? You mean to say you're betting on the team? Why sure. What's wrong with that? Plenty. Why, even professionals aren't allowed to bet. You're supposed to be an amateur. Now look. Everybody in town's betting. Why can't I? I'm working for it, ain't I? It just isn't done, that's all. They don't allow it in football or horse racing. You know yourself that a jockey can't bet on the horse he's riding. Are you kidding? If he's caught, he gets sent down and you know it. Tommy, I'm going to put this to you straight. If you don't stop betting, I'm dissolving the basketball team and closing the recreation center. Just for a few bets? Yes. The whole idea is clean sport. Betting among players leads to bribery, jealousy, and out and out crime. Choice is up to you, Tommy. Either you quit betting or the team's through, and you and the boys go back to juvenile court. Oh now, wait a minute, Mr. Wilson. Don't blame the whole team on account of me. I'll do what you say. I'll quit betting. That's a promise. All right, I'll take your word for it. But I've got ways of finding out if you're not doing it. And if that happens, you go straight to reform school. No more betting. That's a promise. All right. Now take over your newspaper corner and do some real work for a change. That's all, Tommy. OK, Mr. Wilson. 'Bout time. We've been waiting for half an hour, and that truck's plenty hot. Steve Wilson sent for me. Trouble? I'll tell you later. I'm not crazy about moving in daylight, either. The best time, Joe. The kids are all working. Yeah, well the cops can see you better too. Come on. Let's unload this thing. Thanks. How about leaving that for a little bet? Oh, that's what I wanted to tell you, Joe. Wilson warned me against betting. How's he gonna find out? I don't know, but I'm not taking any chances. You see, it's not only me. It's the whole team. He'll break us. We're betting four to one on a sure thing, Tommy. So are you. Four to one? That's the odds against the Wildcats. They haven't got a chance. Oh no? What do you mean? We're talking about insurance, Tommy. You're gonna take that money I gave you and bet it on the Wildcats. What, you want me to throw the game? You get it. Hey, I'm not going to get my team in trouble. How are they gonna know? If I throw a game? What do you think, they're dumb or something? I don't know if I can do it alone. Oh, you can do it Tommy. You're the captain. Then let's put it this way. I won't do it. You'd better think it over, kid. You cut yourself in. We didn't send for you. OK. But after this game, I'm through. Better wait until you make yourself a few grand. You might need it. I said I'm through after I throw this game for the Wildcats. Good enough. Tommy? Yeah. Give me that bankroll. We're betting this on the Wildcats for you. Yeah, it's insurance, like Joe said. He's getting hard to handle. No, he ain't. Too late for him to be getting ideas. Better get that money down. Well, it looks as though we're about ready to go now. The Big Shots will defend the north basket. The Wildcats, the south. And [INAUDIBLE] of the Wildcats driving in for a layup shot. And it's good. First [INAUDIBLE] small game. It's two to nothing, Wildcats leading. [INAUDIBLE] gets the ball from [INAUDIBLE] with his long down to Boyd. That's a nice pass in to Holton. It's good. It's Snead now hunking one in from off the [INAUDIBLE]. And it's the Big Shot's first goal of the game. [INAUDIBLE] now to [INAUDIBLE] down the far sideline. Cutting in down the middle and looking to pass fast to Malone. [INAUDIBLE] Riggs now, runs far out, and it's good. And it frames the score up to eight to four, the Wildcats still leading. What happened to Tommy? He's certainly off his game tonight. Beginning to think it's my fault. Your fault? Yeah. Balling out I gave him seems to have taken the steam out of him. Don't worry about that, Steve. He deserved it. That's young Tommy Malone with it now. No good. That Malone now off his customary game, and th Big Shots don't look quite themselves yet. There goes [INAUDIBLE] of the Wildcats driving in for a layup shot, and it's good. It's good. [INAUDIBLE] shot. [INAUDIBLE], putting the Wildcats up from 25 to 20 as the half nears. Well, Tommy Malone, star of the Big Shot team, has scored only one bucket in the first half. And you know what they say. As Malone goes, so go the Big Shots. I just had a horrible thought. What? You don't suppose Tommy isn't trying because he isn't betting on the team? I don't think Tommy would play that dirty. There she goes. [INAUDIBLE] picks it up. [INAUDIBLE] core pass and they flip to Boyd who scores. Don't think they're going to be [INAUDIBLE]. Another miss by Malone. Tommy makes those with his eyes shut. Malone is on the free throw line. It's no good. I can't understand why Ed doesn't take Tommy. Take out the captain? [INAUDIBLE]? Just isn't done. Mr. Malone shooting now in a bank shot from the side. Too long, no good. And it's Glen taking the rebound, going down the floor in a long pass down to Tarnell. A nice big [INAUDIBLE] on [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]. And there goes the gun ending the ball game. The score 44-38, for the Wildcats. Wildcats win going away. Not to be tracked from their performance a bit, it must be conceded that the Big Shot's star, Tommy Malone, had a very sour night. Well, guess we can't win them all, huh Tommy? Ah, it was my rotten playing, Pinky. Oh no, it wasn't. You were just off your feet. Still the best, Tommy. Thanks, Pinky. Well, I guess everybody has off days sometimes, huh? Yeah. But I can't understand why Tommy didn't catch the signals we gave him. Nice work, Tommy. You made yourself some real dough. Stop over tomorrow and we'll settle up. Yeah. What's eating you? Nothing you'd care about. Oh, I know, kid. It was tough taking that beating. Don't let that bother you. We're going out on a job tonight. You'll have some more dough in that kitty tomorrow. I don't want that dough. I don't want any part of you guys. The whole thing's off, and I mean everything. I don't get it. I don't get it at all. Keep your shirt on, Tommy. I'll see you at the office tomorrow. Hello, Tommy. About the game... I get it. Wait a minute, Marion. I'm sorry, but everybody's been talking about the game. I'm just sick of hearing about it. I understand, Tommy. How about asking a girl to take a walk? Not tonight, Marian. I... I think I'll hit the hay. All right. You know something, Tommy? What? You always wanted a lot of money so you could do things, have a good time, and wear swell clothes. You were unhappy because you were broke all the time. Now you've got all kinds of money, but you're sure not happy. Something's gone wrong. What is it, Tommy? Nothing. It's none of your business anyhow. I'll call you back. That's nice publicity you guys got. Well, not as nice as some of yours, Tommy, but we hit the front pages. I went by and saw you left the furs in my building. What's the idea? Your building? Well... You know what I mean. I told you I was through last night. Yeah, well we ain't. What's more, we'll be through when we say so. You put in with us, and you're staying in. And the softer you get, the harder we get. Lucas said you'd let me up when I threw the game! We didn't say nothing like that. Did you say it, Joe? Well, we couldn't have said it because we got another game for you to throw, the big game between your team and the Giants. Well, you get yourself another boy, huh? Tommy... Let go. You listen to me, Tommy. You wanted to be a big shot. You cut yourself in for a piece of our racket. OK. Now you're in. We've got a few grand coming to you. We're betting out on the basketball Giants. Now beat it. He'll do it. He's scared now. Yeah, well I don't trust him. He's liable to sing to the cops. He does, he goes to reform school. He does, he goes all right. But not to reform school. He said he was having lunch with you in the [INAUDIBLE] Press Room. Yeah. Well, if you hear from him, send him down to the center in a hurry. Fine coach, keeping the team waiting. Go on, fellows. Choose up sides. I'll see if Ed's come in yet. All right, Frankie. You can be captain of the scrub team. What do you call? Heads or tails? Heads. Toss. Must have fell all the way through. Ah, forget it, Dum Dum. You'll never find that anyhow. Here, use this. Dum Dum sure hates to lose money. Yeah, he'll be tearing up the floor looking for that quarter. You two stop beating your gums. Forget it, I said. You're wasting your time. Now toss it! Heads again. Tails. I'll take Skinny. Dum Dum. Pinky. Well boys, I can't stay any longer. Ed should have been here by now. Let's call it quits till tonight, huh? See you later. What's this for, Dum Dum? I gave it to you for the two bets you lost. Ain't got time to play around, Dum Dum. Wait a minute, Tommy. Dum Dum must have found something downstairs. Look, it ain't our business what's downstairs. [INAUDIBLE], Dum Dum thinks it's important! Come on, fellas. Hey fellas, look! Somebody stashed them right under our feet! Yeah. How 'bout it, Tommy? How's about nothing. I'm just as surprised as you guys. In a pig's ear. You didn't want Dum Dum to look for his quarter. And you didn't want us to come down here. You're in on this, Tommy. And after we promised Steve and Lorelei... All right, all right. So I knew about it, but I couldn't say anything. Joe Moreley and his gang brought the furs here. If I'd squawked, they'd have bumped me off. You didn't get paid off, maybe. Yeah. Sure. That's how he got all that money to make them bets. No, I just happened to be here when he brought the hot skins in. What could I do? How'd you happen to be here? Because I had to get something from my locker that I needed. We'd better call the cops and tell them. We'd better not call the cops, or they're liable to think we did it. We're on probation, remember? Yeah. And that'd sure put Steve and Lorelei on the spot and [INAUDIBLE] up their whole idea of helping out fellas like us. Hey, wait a minute, fellas. Why can't we take the furs back to the store where they came from? Then nobody'd know they were here and we wouldn't be in trouble, and neither will Steve and Lorelei. Pinky, that's a wonderful idea. We'll take them tonight, get in through the skylight. Suppose we get caught? We won't get caught. Well, I don't like it. But I guess there's nothing we can do about it. We got to get these things out of here. Well, OK. You sure got us in a jam. Let's all meet here after practice tonight. Now Pinky and I will go up and [INAUDIBLE]. You guys wait here. As soon as we break in, I'll give you [INAUDIBLE]. Then you get the furs out of the trunk, follow us. OK. Now watch for cops. Understand? Come on, Pinky. We could never get [INAUDIBLE]. Well, why don't we just leave the furs on the floor here and beat it, Tommy? That's what we'll have to do. What'd you do? What'd you do? Tried to open a window to call the fellas. Well, you little stupid! Don't you know all windows have burglar alarms? Well, I... I didn't know! We gotta get out of here now. Get up! Beat it! Beat it! Now we're on our own. Stick close to me. Come on! Ah, go ahead, Tommy. I can't get over that fence. I can't leave you here, Pinky. Go on, the cop will get you! Pinky! Pinky! "The dead boy, Pinky Jones, was one of the delinquents paroled to 'The Press' by juvenile court Judge Hogan. It is significant that he was killed after trying to break into the Mason Fur Company from which a quarter of a million dollars worth of furs had been stolen recently." How vicious can they get? Can't expect any sympathy from "The Chronicle." Pinky, that poor kid. Yes? Captain Henry and Lieutenant Peterson to see you. Send them in. I wonder if they found anything. We'll soon know. Hello, Captain. Hi, Steve. Lieutenant. You know Lorelei Kilbourne? Oh, sure. We found two sets of fingerprints on the skylight above the Mason loft. Sorry, Steve. But one set belonged to Pinky Jones. And the other? We don't know yet. We're going over to your recreation center now. I understand the boys are practicing for the game tonight. That's right. I'm taking pieces with me to fingerprint the whole team. We'll soon know who was with Pinky. Do you have to do that before the game? Well, why not? Well, if one of the boys is guilty, I want you to get them, of course. But suppose they're innocent. We've got to find out who that other boy was, Steve. Lieutenant, uh, how long will it take you to, uh, check these fingerprints? Oh, couple of hours. Peterson's meeting me at the gym after he does the lab work. |'ll see you there. All right. Thanks, [INAUDIBLE]. You know we're in trouble, don't you Curly Locks? Hey Skinny. Toss me my jacket, will you? Get it yourself. Look guys, about last night, I'm... We got to play this game, but outside of that, we don't want nothing to do with you. What's the matter with you guys? If it wasn't for you, Pinky'd be here right now. Don't you think I know that? Don't you think I'd rather got that cop's bullet instead of him? Do you have to keep sticking that knife in and turning it? You want to treat me like dirt, go ahead. You've got a right. But snap out of it for the game, will you? You want to win the game, don't you? Pinky would've wanted it that way. All right, Big Shots. On the floor, ready to go. All right, let's go. What are you in on the game, Louie? Two and a half [INAUDIBLE] the Big Shots. -Give me [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] the Giants. You're on. Sucker. Hey, [INAUDIBLE]. There's Louie now. Why don't you ask him? Come and sit down, Louie, I want to ask you something. Is there a lot of betting on this game? This game? This is just a nice, clean sport, ain't it? There you are. There was any [INAUDIBLE] going on, Louie would know. How'd you make out? I paid another four grand on the Giants. Good. [INAUDIBLE] is over. About ready to go now. The Big Shots will defend the north basket, the Giants the south. And now here's the starting line up for the Big Shots. Uh, center, Frankie Snead. Forwards, Connor and Malone, captain of the team, a valuable basketball player. And guards, uh, Dum Dum Riggs and Peters. [INAUDIBLE] counters now. [INAUDIBLE] dribble down the far side line. Cutting in towards the middle and flipping a fast pass to Malone, who's in there, and scores! And a nice layup shot. The Big Shots [INAUDIBLE] two to nothing. Some fancy passing by [INAUDIBLE] now. Got a nice pass in to Holton, goes in to the hole, and it's good! [INAUDIBLE] with 2-0. There's young Tommy Malone with it now, a [INAUDIBLE]. And [INAUDIBLE], and it's good. And the Big Shots go out in front, 12-8. Hope that kid ain't pulling a switch on us. Pulling too good to suit me. We'll have a talk with him between halves. Al Barrows gets the ball off the back board now. There's a long pass down to Boyd. Boyd shooting, and it's good. And the Giants now trail just 20 to 17. Come on, Frankie boy! Come on, Frankie! There's big Frankie Snead now taking a one hander from the foul line, and no good. And, uh, rebounding and picked up by Riggs [INAUDIBLE]. He thinks [INAUDIBLE] play nicely and drives in. There she goes! [INAUDIBLE]. That's 24-19, That's the gun sound, [INAUDIBLE]. Shot's out in front, and that's the way it is at half time in this epic contest between the Big Shots and the Giants. 24-19 at the half. Oh, the boys are certainly in there pitching. Don't see Lieutenant Peterson here. Oh, don't worry. The way those kids are playing, they haven't anything on their minds except basketball. And let's take a rundown on the individual scoring now. Well, Tommy Malone is red hot tonight. He scored 16 of his team's 24 points, a great performance. Yeah? I'm going to cut it short, kid. I don't know whether you're making it look good, or what you're trying to do. But the second half better be different. Double cross us and try to win it. Take a look up where we're sitting. I'll have my heater on you every minute. Hey there, folks. It's all on Louie. Oh, Louie. Popcorn. -Why so big hearted, Louie? [INAUDIBLE] on the game? Boy, am I cleaning up. I mean, uh, we're sure cleaning up on the other team, ain't we? Well, ready to go for the second half now. There's the center jump. Frankie Snead passes to Malone. Uh, Holton steals the ball from Tommy and [INAUDIBLE] some fancy passing by the Giants now. Holton is driving in [INAUDIBLE] center, and it's good too. The score is 24-21. It's Riggs with the ball now for the Big Shots. Shooting... no good. Al Barrows of the Giants picks it up. It is a cross core pass, and they flip to Boyd who scores. 24-33. [INAUDIBLE], captain [INAUDIBLE]. There's Malone. It's no good. What's happened to Tommy? That was an easy shot. Tommy certainly has lost his eye here in the second half. There's Peterson now. I'm going to find out about those fingerprints. All Barrows of the Giants has the ball now. It's a long shot, and it's good! The Giants go out in front in this ballgame for the first time. 25-24. Two shots. Two shots. Malone is on the free throw line. Two gift tosses, and they could be important points. No good. Play this. One shot. Ready now for the second try. Nope! Nothing there. Five, number five. Foul on number five, pushing. And now it's a foul on Malone. He makes it. Who's been deliberately throwing the game right in front of your eyes? Not Tommy. Yes, Tommy. What's more, the captain tells me there's been a lot of wise money laid on the Giants, and I'll bet Tommy's in on that too. I can't believe this. What a couple of saps. And the Giants are now out in front, 29-26. These are the skylight prints, and these are Tommy Malone's. That's him there with the ball. We'll have to pick him up. You take care of these. Right, Captain. They're going to take Tommy out of the game. Afraid we've failed, Curly Locks. And the basket was scored by Tommy Malone. Well, what a hectic ball game this has turned out to be. Malone's sensational shot mid quarter's put the Big Shots right back in contention. It's 29-28 now, the Giants leading. Oh, Malone has the ball of the game. If he scores, [INAUDIBLE] ball game for the Big Shots. He better not make this one. Well, I ain't taking any chances. And the game is over. The Big Shots win by one point on that sensational last second shot by captain Tommy Malone. Malone... uh oh. Malone is down on the floor. He's bleeding! What happened, Tommy? It was Cato. He shot me. Something wrong. He seems to be seriously hurt. Captain, police! Tommy's been shot! What's that? Those guys over there did it! Joe Moreley and Cato! Grab them, boys. Hey Moreley! Cato! Stop there! Take him in there. Tommy Malone's confession at the Big Town Hospital has started a general clean up of the underworld element in the city. Even "The Chronicle" let you down easy, Tommy. Yeah, I know, but I got a rap to take, and I deserve it. Say, this won't ruin chances for the guys, will it? I mean, they won't take them off parole? Oh no. After all, the other boys have been doing fine. Judge Hogan thinks our experiment in juvenile work is succeeding. He's sending us three more boys. Ah, that's swell. Marion, why do you waste your time on a guy like me? I'm going to waste a lot more waiting for you to come out. What was that for? Well, Mariam's probably kissing Tommy right now, and I don't see why I should let the younger generation get ahead of me. Ah, that's a good question. Also a good answer.
