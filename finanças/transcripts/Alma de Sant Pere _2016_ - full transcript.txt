Remembrances. Memory. It's a bit strange. I mean, when you look at an old picture you should be surprised by you how old fashioned your clothes seem, or by how ridiculous your hairstyle was even when it was taken only a few years ago. It's also strange how easy it is to remember how you felt then. Not just in the very instant the picture was taken, but also during that entire period of time, before and after that. Well, these is my city, my neighborhood, my town.Barcelona. These are my friends. That was my party. Some years ago, when I was thirty. I still remember the tension I had then. Like it happened yesterday. ♪ Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday, dear Alma... ♪ 30. When you are 30, you feel like... well, like Coco Chanel. When she was 30, she launched her sportswear collection creating something new and becoming a legend. I didn't want to become a legend, I didn't want to be famous. Put your hand like this. But I wanted to do something special. With my friends. - Let's try and fit into one. - We we will not fit into one! - Once in Bucharest... - Yes, we know, nine of you fit into one taxi. Eleven, yes, in a freaking taxi, a tiny one... Weren't you nine? Alright, let's take two taxis. Gorgeous! - It's a magic card. - Oh! That's mine! - Is that your mobile? - Yes! Thanks, I thought I had it. - If you give me a kiss. - Yes. - Bye! - That was lucky, wasn't it? Gorgeous! Wait, wait... Amazing! No way! - Alright then. - Let's go and have a drink. Come on, let's go... Well, I'll catch up with you guys later. Now we all fit into a taxi! Anyway. I am Alma. And my city is called Barcelona. I like it. It has it all. And I like my life. I am alive. That is the best. ♪ Alma, my life, my heart ♪ My life, my heart, my love - What went wrong? - What do you mean? We are all 30! Valeria, Alma... - Not me. I'm twenty something. - Right! - Sure, twenty something plus twenty something! -Yeah... - You don't know how old I am, you don't. - I don't, my friend, I don't! I may look old, but I am not. No, you are not old, you are slightly mature. Valeria... Hey! Quiet, quiet. Where is it? Who? Where has it gone? It's been more than four years since graduation. And we said... That's right! The first million, the first million! We said we'd earn our first million before turning 30! Listen up, I'd like to raise a glass. To us! That are such losers! - No, no. - The hell with it, to the losers! No, to Alma, it was her birthday after all and is a very hard working woman and owns this amazing apartment! - That the bank owns, but still. - To the banks! To mortgages! The first million. What an idea! And we used to take it so seriously... All of us. We used to get together in a bar and would try to come up with a project for the five of us. Make money. Make the dream of the first million a reality. Valeria! - I'm off to work. - Ok, I'll tidy up for you later Quico, Quico! What? I'm off, bye. Hey, I have a match today at 2 with Mateo. Well, get a move on then! Bye. - Alma, how about a kiss? - Brush your teeth! And my business. My own small business. Putting in contact the people that want to sell with the people that want to buy an apartment, an office or a shop. I have a desk, my working corner in Emilio s office, a friend of my father's. So, you are telling me that from 120,000, you'd like to go down to 110,000, right? Listen, if you can hold for a minute I have the owner on the other line. 5,000. The price stays at 115,000. If you agree to this, we can close the deal in one week. Congratulations. No, you don't have to thank me. It's a pleasure to help you make your dream come true. I told you! Hello, it's Alma, from "Living in a Dream". Yes, of course he tried to bargain, but the price stays at 115,000. Well, I told you it'd be above 100,000. And it has been. - Shall we go in? - Of course. - I don't know whether it's open, is it? -Well, ask him. - Hello? - Hello. - Hey, sorry, are you closed already? -We are about to be. - Could we have a quick drink? - Sure, but quickly, you have 10 minutes. - Sure, alright. - Three beers, please. Ok. I need the toilet. And I'll have a look around. Alright. What are you doing tonight? - Well, I'm going home. - Why? Because I need to take the kids to football practice tomorrow morning. I see. Because my ex-wife can't take them and she asked me to do it. Yes... thank you. Are you mad? - Nope. - Yes, you are! It smells a bit bad, doesn't it? I've been thinking about giving it like an exotic touch, some bamboo canes, and make a bit dark. An oriental touch. Precisely! And a sushi bar right here would be so cool. Right? Just like that... And then, like, you know, a DJ at the back, you know, some electronics, but sort of minimalistic... - But, hang on...! -...sort of like a place to have drinks afterwards. Afterwards, you mean, make food, dinner, sushi and all that... Have you asked for the price? - No. I haven't asked the price. - Well, that's the first thing. You have not asked price. So, you don't know if it's for sale? No, I don't know if it's for sale, but... Ah, you are the best! Market research? What subject was that? Ok, I've thought about this many times, alright? And this is very quiet. And besides, the owner is a rather old guy that's sometimes here, and then... I've thought that if you came and made a good offer you know? They would sell because they want to retire... Valeria, the first thing is to ask for the price. Otherwise, this is just a total waste of energy. - Right, that's what we are here for! - Well, then, ask for the price. - Alright, I will! - Ask! - Hey, excuse me! - Yes, shoot. - Hey, is the owner around? - I am. - Wow, this place is fantastic. - I'm not selling, alright! No, no, that is not what I'm saying at all, no. Not selling, I was only about to ask, no man, please. Oh, that was just in case you were. But perhaps you'd be interested in renting it. You'd have to make me an awesome offer, otherwise... Well, money... We should talk about it... you have a ballpark figure - of the selling price? - How much are you offering? How much are we offering? We'd have to do market research. We'd have to come with an expert and we'd see... how things are - Come on, man. - Well, then. - 20,000, done, right now. - 20,000 for this? - A month? - Come on. Hand them over. 20,000 rent? Yes, this is the gothic quarter, right? Barcelona. - This place needs renovations. - No, there's nothing to renovate! It just needs some sprucing up. This place is in top form! Well, there's quite a lot of sprucing up around here, isn't there? And that's even an understatement. Hey, why don't you get the hell out of here and go tease someone else? - Don't get nervous. - You are not even going to have your beers. - Hey, man, listen, I'll give you 30,000. -Quico, Quico. You are going to be stuck with your bar! No, man, no, just let him keep his bar! The bar, the bar, listen, why don't we go and ask at the cathedral? Who knows, it might also be for sale. - Alright. - Ok, fine, I'm going home. I am very tired. My suggestions is... why don't you go and find a place? Oh, she got mad! No, come on guys, we need to find another place. This has taken a while... Yes, we need to prepare for this a bit better. We cannot just turn up at a place not knowing whether the guy is going to sell or what is he going to do. So, I'd go to a place, have a better look around, and then we would decide. Alright, what are you guys doing now, should we talk about this over drinks? I have to go home. Early morning tomorrow. Later, beauties! - Do we go for a drink? - Sure, let's go. A drink sounds great. Let's go! My family lives here. And it's tiny just like my business. My father and I moved to Galicia after his divorce. And of course, there's my grandma, who's been in the hospital for almost two years. I should visit her more often. Alma, daughter! How are you, darling? It's been so long.. .Finally, right? Come in, come in. I wanted to talk to you. - Yes. - How are you? Fine, yes, I got rid of the land line... Oh, that's right, no wonder we couldn't talk! - Right. - But, how are you? - Tired, yes, I needed to rest a bit. -Well, are you hungry? You know, I've spoken with the doctors and they have said that, well, that she is in pretty bad shape again. I don't know, they've said it's a matter of days or maybe weeks. - They've said two weeks at most. - Is that right? Alright, we will talk about it soon. Let's eat now... Careful... Do we have everything? How are things with Quico? How are things with Quico? Pretty normal. But, I mean, you have plans of some sort? What, with Quico? No way! I don't know, it seems to me you are wasting your time, Alma. Might be. - Can I say something? - No. - Well, you need a decent man! - Ok, can I say something? Perhaps you should look for a woman, too. - Are you referring to the frozen pizza? -Yes, for example. Perhaps, I don't know. - Would you like a cigarette? - Thanks. Look. Grandma has made me very worried. In addition, we have the issue of the apartment, I don't know, you could have a look there. Right. Could you go, please, for me? Yes, I don't know when I'll go, but I'll do it. Give me the keys and I'll go one of these days. Thanks. - Coffee? - Um... light, please. What are you doing? Um... nothing. Classifying information. I have to go see my grandma's apartment. Where is it? Well, it's in the neighborhood. I would also need to speak with my father to figure out what to do with the apartment. What do you mean? It's been quite a while, about five years, since I've been there. I'm not sure about the condition it's in. But my father says they have a permanent contract. You could sell the deed and make some serious money! Seriously? How much are we talking about? I don't know, but let's see, the apartment is in a good location and you could... well, never mind. No, what? - It doesn't matter, forget it. - No, what? Let's say a construction company wants to fix the apartment, right? But in order to do that, they would need to buy all the contracts. But in order to buy all the contracts, they would have to buy the entire building. And you would profit most if you didn't sell at that time and waited. Get it? And my coffee? Alma! It's Alma, right? Yes. What are you doing around here, don't you remember me? It's Alfredo. - Alfredo! - Your grandma's neighbor. - Yes! - How are you doing? What a surprise to see you around here! It's been eight or ten years since I last saw you, you look great. Yes, at least... And your grandma? It's been two years since I've heard from her. I have no idea what is going on with her. Yes, she is living with my father. She is not doing so well. Is she ill? Yes, she's been in hospital, she is not doing so well. How terrible, what a pity... it's just that... I don't know anything about her. Well, the thing is that it's been two years since she's been with my father. Ah, with your father, of course, it makes sense. I've just come round to see the apartment. - Really? Do you want me to come along? -No, there's no need. Why don't you come over? Marta will be very happy to see you. - Will you be home in the later? - Yes, I'll be there in the afternoon. - Well, I might come over then. - Please, do. - Alright. - It was great seeing you, you look beautiful. - Thanks, bye! - Bye! When I was a child, I used to run up the stairs all the way to my grandma's apartment. I used to race my father. And I would always win. Always. Of course he would let me win. I remember the staircase being so spotless, so shiny. But the apartment looks just the same. Still filled with my grandma's laughter. Even when the furniture has been moved, I can still feel her warmth. This was my second home. - Good afternoon - Good afternoon Do you need help? I'm sorry, I don't speak much Spanish. Do you need help? I could carry your trolly if you like. To the fifth. - Everything is okay? - It's fine. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Bye. - Bye. Alma! How are you? You've decided to come, how nice! - Yes, yes, in the end... - It's great to see you again. Yes, you too. - Come on in, come on in. - Ok, sure. Wow, how nice Marta, Marta, look who's come to see us. I'm not selling! I don't want to sell! I don't want to sell! Darling, it's Alma, Daniela's granddaughter, remember? Daniela! Now I remember! Oh, Marta, I'm so glad to see you! Oh, me too. Let's go into the kitchen. What does Marta mean she is not selling? Let's see... what she means is... Too much has happened in this building in the last two years. Always someone knocking on the door, we've received letters and things, - and you know, she is quite startled... -But why? It's that... you father hasn't told you what's happened? I talked to him two years ago. - No. - Well, you know, the Noguiera family... Noguera? Noguera, the one that used to own the building, well, they've sold it. Right. The thing is that the family built this apartment building in 1878 for the workers of their metallurgical company. They used to own a company that made beams, that operated in the harbors, railroads a very important company here in the area. It employed a lot of people. That's why they built this place. And they've sold it, just like that. In 2006, the Noguera family sold the building to a French real estate company. - And they want to kick you out? - Naturally, they want to kick us out. And how much are they offering you? Nothing! They just want to throw us out on the street. And of course, this situation has really upset Marta, with her condition and her things... Haven't you defended yourselves somehow? Of course we have. One family agreed, I don't know, they gave them some money and they've left. But the rest, we keep on fighting, even your grandma Daniela was fighting with us. But she has a permanent contract, and so do you. Exactly, we do have permanent contracts. Do you know that the entire history of Marta's family has taken place here, in these very rooms? Generation after generation has been born here. So they can't kick us out just like that, it's impossible! We are not leaving! We are fighting, we are going to do everything in our power! Do you understand? Sometimes you have the feeling that something important is about to happen. Even when you don't know exactly what. Just like when someone gives you something beautiful. No, no, Thursday is impossible. Wednesday, Wednesday would be perfect. Anytime, whatever is good for you. Wednesday? Wednesday afternoon. Sure. When then? 5 o clock. Perfect! Great, bye. Emilio, I have a question. Could you call your cousin, the one that works at the property registration office? - Mariona? - Mariona. The thing is that I need to know something extremely important, that cannot wait. Look, you know, this will not be for free. She likes chocolate and wine. White or dark chocolate? What is the best present you can possibly get? What you have really earned, what you have created yourself. What makes you happy and scares you at the same time. An emotion that you would like to share immediately but that you keep to yourself. We have the project, you know. - What project? - My grandma's apartment. What are you talking about? About the entire building. I bumped into Alfredo, my grandma's neighbor. He told me that a real estate company tried to buy the entire building. But they had tons of disputes with the tenants. Right, that's normal. Yes. In the end they didn't manage to evict them and they backed off. But we most certainly can. Let's see, do you know any construction companies? Iván! Wow, who know, this might even work out. We could speak with Valeria. She could take care of the design of the apartments and setup the webpages. Each of us would have their own individual project within the big project. We could speak with Susana. She has loads of contacts in Russia. Russia? And why not China? Because the Russians are loaded and they are buying it all. So, this would work if we had the money and if we could buy the entire building. - Right. - But there are too many "ifs". I want to make this dream come true! Damn it! This freaking dust is killing me. It is filling every hole. We've been knocking down walls for two weeks now. And is this all the protective gear you are wearing? Yes. What's up, mysterious girl? If we are five in the project, then each of us would have three flats, except for me, I'd have four. Then each of us would have a part of the business? That's the plan. It's rather complicated, but possible. We would need to get the building at a very low price. Are you in? Call them and tell them you have a client. Use my uncle's name if you need to. And make a very low offer. - How low? - A million. 1.2 million. Ridiculously low. They are not going to sell at that price. Of course not, but if they are interested in selling they will tell you the price. And I need you because you are the best. You are in touch with people from Russia, Czech Republic, Ukraine... with loads of money. Good afternoon, I am Alma. And how are we going to finance this? The bank will. At this point I do not have half a million to spare, do you? None of us does. But that is not a problem if we all have guarantees for the loan. I wonder if you are the right person to send the offer? I can send it by fax or email. I have it ready. Great, I can send it right now. Alright, thanks, bye! Alma, living in a dream? I remember once when I was playing basketball. At the end of the game, I threw the ball from very far away. The ball flew across the court and went into the hoop at the very last second. I don't remember whether we won, but I remember I was flying as well. - Hello - What's up! Tell me the news. Well, I've offered 1.3 million for the building... and they haven't accepted the offer. Of course they haven't accepted it. But because Iván is a fortune teller, they have told us the price. Alma, will you tell us the damn price already? Alma, you are like the "Who Want's to be a Millionaire" host! Well, we are playing the same game! Yes. Tell us now! - One point nine. - One point nine... Damn! - A bargain! - A bargain? Yes, yes! Iván, how much do we need for the renovation? 1.2, 1.3 million... Right, so we need three million. And we all have money like Susana, right? Me? I don't have money. I owe my bank more than all of you together. About half a million. But I am ready to take the risk. If I manage to sell my three apartments I'll be able to breathe again. And you guys? The same. Ok, let's offer 1.6 million, alright? If they accept, we would then have a three million project. That is a 700,000 risk for each of us. But that's half a million extra! Well, yes. We can then spend. We don't have to spend it all. Besides, we would have to compensate the neighbors in order for them to leave. Yes, that's true. Well, ladies and gentlemen... we've got ourselves a project! - To the huge project! - We are going to be... millionaires! If we find a bank this is the deal: each one of us will invest 600,000 and will have three apartments, except for me, I'll have four. Oh, yes, and I'll be running the project, ok? Yes. Ok, then. Quico and I have some meetings already with the banks. We have contacts. Valeria, how long do you need to design the apartments and the webpage? - About a week. - Wow, that's too long. Today is Wednesday. It has to be ready by Monday. By Monday... why? Because the offer is valid for two weeks only. Iván, can you work out the budget and the renovation timeframe in time? - Sure. You'll have them ready on Sunday. -Fantastic. Susana, we need a business and marketing plan for the bank. I'll start today. Can I work in your office, Alma? Yes, I guess so. I'll have to ask the others. Perfect, it's just perfect. Hey, how's the webpage going? Damn, I still need a few more hours, ok? Are you doing that now? - Valeria! It has to be ready in the morning! -Yes. - Out, get out! - Alright! Alma, let's not speak too quickly, ok? We need to seem professional. Come on! Ladies first. - Now what? - We continue. We go to BBVA. Ok. - What? - Nothing has come out of this! - What did you say that for? - I don't know! Well, now I don't know what we are going to do! Quico! - Quico! - What? What is it? - We have to go to Puigmoltó tomorrow. -No. - Yes. - No. Your father hates me. - No, he doesn't hate you. - Yes he does. - No, we have to go, otherwise this is over. -Alma, no! You know, we have nothing to lose. Alright. Alright. Alright. No... no, let's get some sleep, ok? Ok? Ok. I once saw a lion jump through a hoop. I felt my father squeezing my hand tight I wasn't nervous at all. I had the feeling that the tamer was telling the lion how to behave. I have to admit that my father has been my lion. And I hope things remain this way. - Hello! - Hi, gorgeous, how are you? - Just fine - Francesco. - Very handsome, isn't he? - Thanks. - What do you want, to play vampires? -No. No, come on, not vampires. Let's see, we are offering new apartments in new buildings. - That's not playing vampires. - Papa, we will pay them to leave. Yes, but how much? - Thousands of euros. - But how far can you go? Well, as far as necessary, until they are happy. Yes, until they are happy... we will test the waters. We will offer them a few thousand euros and we will see how far we can go. But you cannot underestimate people's feelings. Home is home! They might not want to leave even when you are paying them to. It might be so. What are you talking about? I think our offer is fair. The other construction company didn't offer them anything! Nothing. I don't know, I don't know. Look, Dad, the banks think it's an excellent project. But the fact that tenants live there, poses too big a risk. - I agree with that. - Well, it has to be tried. Hey... how about a cigarette break? Will you make us some more coffee? We'll go and smoke a cigarette. What the hell is this? What has that man put in your head? No, Dad, this is my project, it is my idea. Well, to me it seems he has something to do with this, I don't know. No, Dad, no, first of all, I have spoken with the owners and they want to sell the building. Second, grandma's neighbors, Dad, I will speak to them with confidence, I will convince them. If I don't do this, somebody else will! And third, I have calculated everything. I have spoken with everyone, we just need to convince them. This is my project! Trust me! I feel very strongly about this, I do, everything will be alright! Alright then, I'll make the call. I'll introduce you, and you'll deal with it. I don't know... Ok, I'll talk to them. Alright? Can I have a hug? I love to see how footballers celebrate when they score. - Well? - A beer, Pablo. Especially when they celebrate in a very exaggerated manner. We have the bank. - And with very good terms! -It's time to party! No, no, no, there won't be time to party in a very long time, Iván. No, now it's time to work, ok? - Damn, you are such a drag! - Are we going to do it, or what? Right, there's nothing to worry about. If we cannot deal with it, we sell the whole shit to the Russians. Or the Chinese! Can I have a glass of wine? Thanks! Alright, let's toast! A free fall. Jumping off a plane, feeling the speed. Enjoying the idea of being immortal. Feeling as if life is like a rocket, taking you to another universe. I does not scare you. You are the hailed queen in the most important royal parties. Rich, filthy rich... Damn it! We've made it. But now we have all the work ahead of us, don't we? - Good morning. - Good morning. Actualluy, I want to present myself to you. - I am Alma Rossell. - Etel. I am the new owner of this building now. As you can see, we have designed all of the apartments with a unique style. An I must say that they are all precious. I am living here, I am living in the place. No problem. We offer a new apartment for each tenant. And we also cover the cost of the move. We are ready to negotiate compensation for terminating... Alma, how many have agreed to move? I have made an agreement with nine apartments. Three of them are empty as you know. So there's only four of us left? Three, because one of them is mine. My grandmother lives here. Thanks for all of this, but I'll wait for the others. If Martha, Vincent and Alfredo go, I'll go. Don't you dare knock on my door ever again! - I am the new owner of the building! - Fuck you. So what should we do? Let's start. Yes, I'll find a way to convince them to leave. Ok, let's do this. We start. I'll find the way how they leave the house. When the first trains started going through the meadows, they must have thought that they had to run the bisons over. I can imagine that they did not touch the breaks when they saw only one on the tracks, nor did they try to lure it away. But I think I know what they did when they saw a herd. They hit the breaks and tried to avoid the collision. Agh, no manners, right? That one could... Agh, another one! Such manners! Um, excuse me, please. You have to sign here, too. That Iván what? Alma! What is this? Your men don't let us go into our apartment. I'm calling the police! No, not the police, no Alfredo, not the police. I'll deal with this right now. Iván! Iván! - Alma, how are you? - What's all this? What's what? You can't prevent people from going into their homes! - We have to kick them out! - Well, not like this! Let's do something then, we don't have much time left! You are insane, this is my project and I'll decide when. You are not going to ruin this for me! Welcome. Let's head to the couch and there you can relax. Ah, I'm so tired... that staircase... Yes, well, there's nothing we can do.. Tell me, Alma. We will start renovations in two weeks. Electricity and water will be cut off. - Don't you dare do that! Don't you dare! - Don't get like that now. Don't you dare cut the water and electricity off! None of that! You are three left, only three left. It doesn't matter how many we are left here. I have the perfect apartment for you, very close by. It has an elevator. I can show it to you, if you want. I don't care. You don't seem to understand that the history of our life is here. Two weeks! - Our family has always lived here! -Two weeks, Alfredo! And what happened with the Indians? The train went through their land. It was madness for them, they didn't know there was nothing they could do. They were helpless. They were the ones that fought against progress. People of old times, of old values. How can you defeat them without stripping them of their dignity? Etel, are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. I need a drink. Would you like to join me? Yes. Alfredo, Marta and Vincent don't want to move. Is that right? They are considering it. They are not considering anything, Alma. They said no to you. Waiter. Do you like it? And you? Have you thought about my offer? Yes. But for me the situation is a bit different. I'm here in... Barcelona to enjoy the last months of my life. What do you mean? I have chronic inflammation of the pancreas. I'm going to die. Understand? If we don't kick these old people out, we will start losing money. Let's give them more dough so they leave. We've done that already. The hell with them! I'll bring some Albanians over and they'll send them packing. And if they resist, they'll kick them out. We can't do that. Damn it, it's our freaking building, isn't it? Two against two. - Susana? Would there be anything else? -No, thanks. Of course not. We are going to give them an offer they could not resist. Which one? 75.000 and an apartment near here. - Over my dead body! - Well, you are dead then, man. So, lets see. What the hell? Are we going to give 225,000 to all these old timers? No freaking way! I don't agree with this. Quico, do you want to sell your part? So? Etel, I have bad news for you. In 2 weeks we to start the renovation on this floor. Maybe even sooner. We have to cut the electricity and the water. But... But? But we have very good compensation. We are offering you 75,000 for the resignation of the contract. And what would the new flat be like? A bit more expensive, but you'd have the certainty of staying there for the rest of your lives. What the hell do I need the money for? And you would also hire some thugs to kick us out of the apartment, right? I have offered Etel and Vicente the same deal. Could you speak with Vincent? He does not open the door when I go. I don't know anything about Vicente. It's been two weeks since I last saw him. Well, you have two weeks to give me an answer. Call me, Etel. Xavi! How's New York? What is Lehman Brothers? Quico, where are you? We have four apartments ready. Robert, a beer! Hi, darling. These guys are interested in the project. That's not even all. We might could sell them the whole shit. - What? What is it? - Javier called. - Javier, Javier who? - From New York. - Ah, your ex boyfriend? - So what about him? He told me that Lehman Brothers is in trouble? - Lemon... freaking what? - A bank, big as hell. He told me that if I, or anyone has money in the bank, it should be taken out immediately! Poor old Javier... faggot! What the hell does he know? Nothing is going to happen here! Shit, shit, shit! We renovate the freaking building, the sooner it's ready, the better for us. - What is it? - The fucking real estate bubble has burst! Look, Lehman Brothers! It's half the Spanish economy. I just can't believe it! What? Well, that you are able to give 780 billion in loans, but no, you only have 638. But what is this? So, you, you as a bank, give away 142 billion you don't have? Yes, it's insane, but it's happening there. Yes, here... here that wouldn't happen. We are safe here. No, we are not. Our project, we are going to finish it before anything happens. If anything happens! Well, I'm going to see Angel tomorrow, the director of the bank. My father has told me that he doesn't have good news. Well, how are we today? We are screwed. How screwed are we? Well, the director of the bank told me that we have no money left for next month. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! If we don't pay the bills we will not even have a penny. And these guys will leave if we don't pay their salaries. Of course. Fuck! Free falling. You try to open your parachute. Desperately. Knowing that once it opens it will hurt you. You know it, but you don't have time to be afraid. And then you hit the ground. Hard. You hit the ground fucking hard. ♪ Ra, ra, ra... The hicks have left ♪ Fucking hell... Next stop... Bucharest. Let's get wasted! Well, at least we've tried... We had a dream... Cava, please... we are getting wasted! To the losers! To the losers! - To the losers! - To the losers! Go to hell, Iván! Alma! They say the state of shock starts immediately after the crisis hits you. You go through the four stages of shock: Initial, compensatory, progressive and refractory. You basically feel like shit everyday, from the moment you wake up in the morning until you go to bed at night, exhausted. That's how I felt. As if an elephant had run me over. No, three giant elephants, and at least four times. Yes, I know, I wasn't the only one, but it does not give you any comfort to know that there are others sharing the same fate as you. Emilio, I'm off - Leaving already? - Yes. I'm so sorry, Alma. It's been five week since I've had a customer. I can't even afford to have a desk. Don't worry about that, you can pay me later. Yes, and then what? When a client calls I should say: "Alma living in a nightmare?" I'm off. Thanks for everything. Right. So just to be clear, on top of you keeping my apartment, I still owe 107,000. And when do I have to pay? You would only pay the interests during the first two years. Hey, guys, are we leaving or what? Francisco, just a minute, please! I'll be out before the end of the month. We are leaving once you've picked that up. And the sofa? Oh, no. Just pick that up and throw it out the window. Would you like a sofa for your mom and dad's house? Or should I just toss it out the window? Where are you going with that? Are we supposed to put it on the roof of the car? It's Valeria's sofa, we don't need the car! No! - This is too much. - Too much! The thing is, I don't know why we've tried. Well, it's because you were very anxious. I was anxious and you were anxious Weren't we talking about the sofa? Yes, we are talking about the sofa, what do you think? Fair enough. What do we do then? We leave the sofa here. Agh, why do we have to talk about the sofa? I don't know. But I can tell you that now I have to go back and live in my parents' house after being away for eight years, and I will have to work in the family business selling toilets, tiles and bidets for about 253 years until I'm able to repay my father what I owe... Yes, but your situation is not as bad as mine. I've lost my apartment and I owe a million euros. More than half a million euros! To the bank! This is madness! That's it. How could I survive a free fall without a parachute? Can anybody tell me if I'm still alive? And if I am, could anybody come and get this elephant off of me? Alma, come on! Alma, hurry up! If we keep Inés waiting she'll go ballistic! Alma! - I know. - Let's go! Have you seen my purse? Yes, you are right, yes. Hi there! How are you? How are you kiddos doing? And that ball? Let's try it out! - Hello. Hi, how are you? - Hi, gorgeous. - Hi. - Hi. - So, what's up? How are you? - Not too bad. Yes, Quico told me that the bank has kept your apartment, right? It's unbelievable how they treat people. Yes, well, Alma is still in shock. No, I'm not. Are you sure? Pass! No, I'm not. I'm angry. Not sure at who, but... At Lehman Brothers, perhaps? Yes, at... at my ambition, I suppose. Yes, alright. Bye. Bye, guys! - Say bye to mom. - Bye! Alright, I'm coming, come on. We need a bigger apartment. Pau and Mateo need their own rooms. Yes, sure, but it's not that easy to rent and find another one. I would rather buy, prices are coming down, and they will be even lower in a few months time. And with what money? Together we owe over a million. Can you tell me how on earth are you going to buy an apartment? Why are you acting as if nothing has happened? One day somebody will turn up and say: show me the money. Lower your voice, the kids are sleeping. Show me the money, show me the fucking money! Show me the money! - Enough! - Show me the money, say it! Show you the money! Show you the money! Show me the money, me! Me! I know! It's my favorite scene. Why are you acting as if nothing has happened? What's your secret, Quico? I don't have any. Yes, you do. And if you don't tell me, I'm leaving. I don't have any debt. Amazing! Do you remember the bar the Chinese owned? - Yes. - Well, they've bought us out, Iván and me. - When did they buy you out? - Iván made the deal. - Oh, yeah? - Yes, he made the deal, it wasn't that good, - but it was good enough. - When, I've asked you when. - You would have done the same. - No, tell me when. Quico, don't mess with me, if you don't tell me, I'll figure it out. Quite soon, two weeks into the renovations. And why didn't you tell me anything? Because, because it was very complicated. What was? Look, it wasn't exactly what you would call clean money, it was gambling money, and Iván told me it was best if I didn't know anything about the conditions. How much do you have? - Three ten. - 310,000! - Go to hell! - Alma! - I knew it'd be this way! - What? I've been to the hospital every single day in the last three years. Grandma? I've been reading to her, talking to her, even during the last year when she would not respond, just checking whether she was dead or alive. And it happens now, on my way home. Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry! It was her time. Dad! - Let's go see her, shall we? - Well, we are not in a hurry now. I've come to have a snack... and like she used so say: life goes on. Is that so? And now, we bring you back to your parents land. Here you are. I should go to Barcelona, to see grandma's apartment, what do you think? Yes, you should. They are not going to kill you, are they? - Who? - Your neighbors. Do you need anything there? A mattress. - Come on, we are almost there. - Can you make it? Yes, yes, I can. - Too much pizza? - I don't know. I don't know, I'd like to paint it... fix it a bit. Do you need anything? Yes, money. - I see. - I don't know. I was thinking about selling the car. It's not like... What? It's up to you. Life goes on. It must be true. I hope there are some bisons left in the meadows. And Indians. They might be using trains now. They might even own some train companies. In fact, they do own some casinos. Yes, when you have nothing left, you don't have anything left to lose either. You don't even care if a bison runs you over, because you've been run over by an elephant. I'm sorry. You are sorry? In fact, you should be very sorry! I am. Now... I need to pay my rent. Where do I pay? - I don't know, I don't know... - You don't know? I don't know! Our bank is bankrupt, and I don't know. The state has created a trash bank... Bankrupt bank, trash bank, I don't even know what that is! Me neither. But we can look it up on the Internet if... I am not so sure about that Internet thing, I don't understand anything! Well, let me grab my laptop, and we can have a look and see if we can find out where you have to pay your rent. - And you would help me? - Yes. - Would you like a coffee? - Nope. I don't have a penny. Are you kidding me? I'm afraid not... Wait... nope, it's not enough. I'm looking for a job. - You are? - Yes, in the meantime I'm restoring chairs and I'm selling them... Well, I'm the half million girl, but in the red. So, the chairs you were carrying were for restoring. It's alright, I guess. But don't worry, the coffee is on me. Ok? - Okay. - Coffee for Alma. I've made a bunch of calls and this is what I've gathered. Now we have to wait and see which bank will keep our building in order to know who do we pay rent to. So when that day comes, I'll be ready. So, as you can see, I've been able to find out a few things. - That's very good. - I'm happy about this, you see? Yes. - Hi, Etel. - Hi, Alma. I accepted... We accepted you're offer. It's nice to hear, but I don't have any money. If you want, I can wash your dishes. - Good. - Yes? Come in. You help me to... Please help me to visit the hospital. Do you have time? That's all I have. When? Now. I have a problem. I can't eat anymore, but let's not tell them. Could you bring my mirror and makeup bag? I can't go out looking like this, can I? - Like an old witch. - No you can't. Etel, do you want a wheelchair? No, I'll walk. It will make things easier for you. A night or two. It's for your own good. I had this discussion a long time ago. If I get worse, I promise I'll come back. Just let me stay home, please. I'll be with her. I'll be her nurse 24 hours a day. Can you still drink and eat? Yes, quite normally. Okay. But first we need to hydrate you and you'll feel more energy. It will be good also for your pain. Etel. I made your bed. I'll stay here. No, I will take the sofa. Could you give me the keys? You don't have to stay here. You don't owe me anything. Etel, shut up. Go sleep in your bed! I promised to be your nurse. A promise I'll keep. Come on. Well done. Etel. You have a fever. Try and drink a bit. I saw my son. Your son? He was just a little boy. Five years old. Where is he now? Did they try to call him? Or send an email? He hasn't answered my calls. He hates me for a reason. Lazar, his father, tried to escape west to Paris. I was afraid. I told all the police and Lazar was arrested. Lazar killed himself in prison. Istvan found out when he was 18. Istvan was so mad at me... That was the last time he saw his father. Istvan hates me. He will not come. It's a matter of hours. She wanted to stay here. Hello? Yes, I'm Alma. The doctor is here and she says it's a question of hours. Yes, but... Who was it? It was Istvan, Etel's son. He is in Afghanistan. He's asked me to send the ashes to Budapest. Antonia! It is said that in China, some of the meals containing egg may cause temporary loss of consciousness, or something of the sort. But if you are lucky, nothing will happen to you. Or some given day, when you decide to cross against a red light, you are run over by an electric car and you spend the rest of your days in bed. Or in a wheelchair. Yes, if you want something in life, you choose a road to achieve it. And a bad decision can turn you into the loneliest person in the world. Just like Etel. She did not deserve that. Vincent? Vincent? Yes, yes. It's Alma. The girl you told not to knock on your door again. Remember? Yes. My freaking toes hurt! I can't walk! Damn it! Can I help you? What's happened with the building? I need to have a bit of a rest! Yes, yes... I'll get the door for you. Hold on, hold on to the banister! Could you get me a bit of water? It's in the study. - Are you a painter? - A painter of some sort. I like your paintings. Are they all yours? Yes, they are. Do your toes hurt? My toes are killing me! - Why? - I don't know! Can I have a look? Yes, please. - You need a doctor! - Out of the question. I'll never go to a hospital! With the needles and all that... no! But you need to see one. You've never seen a doctor? Of course I have. But Carlos died four years ago. He used to live here before Etel. He used to help all the neighbors. Ok, I think I have a good solution to this. - How are you? - I'm fine, and you? Fine, a bit tired, but fine. Tired? I have another patient for you. It's Vincent, an elderly man that lives on the top floor flat. It seems that he has ingrown toe nails, there's a lot of blood and, well... I don't know what to do. - Alma! - Yes! Listen, come and have a look. Come on, Vincent, let's cure this foot. Alright, Vincent. You will have to learn this routine, ok? - Ok, what do I need to do? - Well, everyday you'll have to clean. Ouch, damn it! Take it easy, Vincent, this will hurt, but it will help. - Relax. - Ouch! - Anything you need you call me. - Thank you very much. - Not at all, woman. - Bye. - Who are you? - Nobody! You are an artist! When I was young. I used to work for a man with a mustache. He was a true artist! This was in Figueres. My grandma used to say that life goes on. I must confess that it is true. Some feel the rain, others get wet. She used to say that also. Anybody could easily tell me to stay away from projects. I don't think I can. Hello! Hello! What's going on? What's happened? Are you going to spend the rest of your life working for your father? Or do you need a project? - So you really haven't found the keys? - No, not to the roller shutter. Here, hold this. Alma, it's just, that we can't be doing this, you know? Yes, sure we can. Quico has told me that the building belongs to a national bad bank and since we are some poor national citizens, we sure can do this. Alright, hurry up! Well, what do you think? Do you like it? I love it! We could have the café area here. - Sure. - Some tables over here, and here we could sell the chairs you restore. And there you could have the workshop. Sure. Nico could perform here on the opening night. Nico who? Nicolás, Susana's boyfriend, haven't you heard? The magician! No. The thing is that, I barely see them. I never see them. Well, I saw Quico, once. - It was not your fault, ok? - Well, to some extent it is. You didn't force us into anything, alright? We could have said no, you know? Alma, this is not your fault. Truth be told, it was a good opportunity... at a bad time. - Listen, did you know that they are pregnant? -What? - Yeah. - Susana? They are living in Nico's apartment, and now they are looking for a bigger place. - Wow! - She is super cute! - Oh, yes? - She has quite a bump already! No way! Oh, how cute! - Vincent? - Yes? - We've brought you some food - Great! Who is she? This is Valeria. Your new gallerist. - My gallerist! - Boy, do we have a fantastic project for you. Yes, Alma has told me about your paintings, and we have found an amazing place, right downstairs, to set up a gallery. Well, not just a gallery. We were also thinking of opening up a restaurant, a small café, selling some furniture so... Calm down, calm down... We need... to talk! - Of course, yes. - Well, but you still haven't said no. Not yet. - Santander has bought us! - What? Yes, look, check it out! I'm so happy! Look! And look, this is the big chief! - Santanter's? - This is his cousin! - Who, this one? - And you know what? Yes, that one! I was member of the group! Of the union! The union of chefs! And the boss's cousin is a chef! - I used to work with him! - You know Santander's boss' cousin? - Yes, exactly! - Santerder's boss's cousin? Yes, yes, I've told you! And I will talk to his cousin. Hello? Yes, Alfredo speaking. Mr. Ruiz! How are you? Good evening! Ah, apologies for changing the day, yes, ok. Due to time difference, right? Perfect! Thank you for calling me. Look, Salvador told me to be brief, that you'd only give me five minutes. Yes, exactly, well, let me explain the history of the building a bit. It was built in 1860 by the Noguera family. Precisely. Here in Barcelona. Sure? Fantastic, yes, I think it's excellent, half an hour!? Perfect, I think it's great! Thanks! - Alma Rosell? - That's right. Come on in. Ok, could I make a small change? What kind of change? Well, to pay for the first month in June. Because I don't have money right now. And do you think you'll be able to pay in June? Yes, absolutely. Agreed then. So we only change the first day of payment. Anything else? Yes. Have you visited the others? I have seen a few apartments. And the one on the fifth floor, Nicolás and Susana's? No. They have been living here for a while now, too. And I have a venue below, that is mine. Why don't you send me an email with all the info. So we will meet again. But don't take too long because I don't have much time for all of this. I have orders to close this in the most satisfactory way for the clients. - Right, thanks! - Thanks. And if you want this, you'll have to tell me now! Otherwise the lawyer will close the deal tomorrow. I love it. And you, Nicolás? Etel's ghost is not around here, is it? Oh, please, Nicolás! There's nothing to be afraid of, ok? Etel was a good soul. - We'll keep it, ok? - Yes! - Yes? - Yes, I think so. Great! - Ok, cheers, to your grandma! - Cheers! Ok, things are going according to the schedule. Do you like it? I love it! - Shall we make the speech? - Yes, let's! - I'm climbing up. - Go ahead! Hi, good evening. Alma has asked me, as her partner, to say a few words. First of all, we'd like to thank you all for being here on this very special night. We are opening our gallery with the first exhibition of the great artist Vincent Muntent. Well, Vincent, apart from being a wonderful painter, was one of the last assistants of Salvador Dalí. Yes, you can read more about his life in the brochure we've handed out. So, let's toast to Vincent. To Vincent! And a toast to our gallery, that even when it does not have a name yet.. - Yes, yes it does. - I'm coming down. Well, as my grandma used to say... excuse me... - Life goes on! - Life goes on! - Do you like it? - Yes. Vincent, Vincent, Vincent! The half a million woman in the red, well, I'm an optimist. The best year is yet to come. To all of us. Of course it's difficult to believe it, but I do really do. I lead a simple life. I get up in the morning, go to work, see my friends, watch TV in the evenings and I go to bed. Yes, I do have a job now. When I think about this circus that we live in, I must admit that I've loved working with the old tigers, lions and elephants. So I decided to study. And the city around me, Barcelona. It's full of life. Just like me. What more could I ask for. I love my life.
