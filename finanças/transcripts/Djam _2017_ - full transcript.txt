"I want to work!" - He speaks. “Come in,” I say. “Come in.” "As a waitress," I say. She replies:"Yes, as a waitress." And once I heard how she sings in the kitchen. My heart stopped. I heard - and that's it ... "Is that how you sing?", - I say. And she:"No ..." "This exile is my singing." "It's not me". The next day, yes that there That evening - she sang. She started singing and the next day it was full of people all came to listen to her. Everything! Armenians, the Kurds, Algerians who suffered too all exiles from their native places - everyone came to see her. Like beasts in a forest fire go to the water so they went to your mother, on her voice. Like this. For them it was ... the voice of their homeland - your mother's voice They met with their homeland, with its south. Exile consumed her heart. Exile poisoned her life. That's what killed her - exile. She always said: "I myself cried the sea, by which you swim! " You know, it's her made me a man She made me a man Oh ho ho ... I sold the restaurant. Came here with you, just... I took her with me:she is here, here, she is here ... and she is happy. Kakurgos, go, dance with me.
