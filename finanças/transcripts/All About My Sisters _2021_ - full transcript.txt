Why are you filming? To know what you went through as a kid. I went through all kinds of stuff. Why didn't you film me then? I went through a lot. But who knows my sufferings? My dad bought me all I asked for. I meant your birth story. My birth? How do I know? So I am filming. What's the point, sis? What's the point in your opinion? If dad hadn't adopted me, would I have died? Yes. I didn't know... I was saved by the herbs that your mom took. I didn't know about it. Your mom told you so? Yes, she did. She hasn't told me that much. I interviewed her. No wonder. About them abandoning me? Your parents dumped me and came back to check on me? You want to see their interviews? Mom and Dad had always wanted a son. Despite her wishes, my mom conceived seven girls in ten years. The fortuneteller saw in those daughters the reincarnation of Seven Fairies. Disappointed, Dad cried in front of Goddess Guanyin. Lü, one of the Eight Immortals, heard his crying. Lü asked Goddess Guanyin to let him reincarnate as a boy for Dad. Touched by Dad's earnestness, Goddess Guanyin consented. Understanding that Lü was missing our world, Dad named their son 'Sifan'. 'Si' as 'miss', 'Fan' as 'the world'. By 2008, I joined your family's life. It has been worse than hell. I had sorted them out. You messed it all up. I'm helping to sort them. You did it all the wrong way! Oops! I did it wrong. If you had asked first, it wouldn't have happened. Your mom's been irritating all day. How could I ask her? You prefer to do it wrong? You're guessing... Because you two are her favorites. Miss, I need a photo for certificate application. Which kind? Look this way. Auntie, I go home for lunch. So you are off work now?! Why would you say that? I'll never work with your parents again. I can't make them happy. Hold on. Press the settings key... What's next? Sit! You are such a useless boy. Aren't you? Aren't you?! Anyone is better than you. Don't expect to eat my food. Jin never phones us. She doesn't visit, as if we are strangers. Don't you know why? - I don't. - You don't trust each other. Trust! I can't visit her every day. I have a store to run! At least, you could phone her. Why would I? Why shouldn't she call? I don't like talking on the phone. I don't know what to say. Her trauma keeps growing in her mind. You can't avoid trauma. It will always be there. She'll never make it out. Like when she lived with us during high school. You know she didn't enjoy it then? That's Jin! She just can't communicate with you. She keeps silent. You can't talk to her. I'm very good to sis Jin. I always support her when Mom scolds her. - When did I scold her? - Last time. - What the hell did I say? - You scolded her. Did I say anything wrong? You made her upset! If she gets upset, what can I do? I think Jin is nice. I often talk to her. I asked her if she holds a grudge talking sincerely about it. She did when she was little. She couldn't understand why she was abandoned. Growing up, she found her way to understand you. She has no grudge now. Then why acting this way? It's just her character, no? She cares about details, we don't. We don't understand her sensitivity. - It's hard to get along. - Be patient! I don't have much patience. We should take the first step, rather than asking her to. You should try to talk to my parents to avoid misunderstanding each other. What do you mean? You can't read each other's mind. They don't know what you think. So you end up guessing each other. But not understand each other. Is this what you want? Give me some advice. You can call them sometime. I don't want to. Tell them how you are. I don't have anything to say. Sifan! Make a bow to the Goddess. Sifan! What are you drinking? A soft drink. Have a real drink! She's breastfeeding. No alcohol. I don't drink. You have to make a toast. Yes. Say something. They've said it all. What else can we say? At least, you should address them. You can't just toast and go. Nevermind. Give her a minute. Forget it. Just a minute. She's crying. Forget it. We understand. We owe you. We owe you. We are one family now. Jin, I know what you've been through. We had no choice then. This is my favorite photo. Your grandma looks like your mom. She's your grandma too. I never meet her or her husband. You never met her? I never met her before she died. I've never had a photo taken with your family. It's normal. I remember when you were in school. Your mom often brought you stuff. She was so nice to you. She picked you up by car on rainy days. What about you? She didn't do that for me. Mom treated us equally, no? No. I never asked your dad to pick me up. Well, you didn't ask. You didn't have to ask. I remember it well. Tomorrow I'll go to my little sister's home. I'm expecting an uneasy day. I remember I skipped school once. She is my real sister. But villagers tease her about her origin: "You look identical to Qiong." "Your parents took you from their home." They'd say from a trash bin. We used to laugh these gossips away. But now, as a family, we have to deal with it. Little sister skipped school today. When was it? January 15th, 2010. Five years ago. Did I skip school? It came as a shock. People sees my sister as a shy girl. I would've never expected her to be so bold. But I was wrong. She did skip school. I don't know what she was thinking. It's easy for them to say she was wrong. But she made me realize, feel deeply, that it isn't her fault, but our whole family's fault. She's so young and knows so little. She remains silent when she's hurt. And she evades after being silent, even if doing so harms her. Ten years ago, Mom gave birth to her. But since she's a girl, and because my family is poor, we couldn't feed one more kid. Dad had to make a decision, which turned out to be... How much do you know about Jin's birth? - Mom talks about it at dinner? - Yes. How they abandoned baby Jin and what happened after. Well, they told that story so many times. But we don't know exactly what happened. So they left Jin on the hill? And someone... found her and put her somewhere? I don't really recall. Mom, sit here. Okay. The lights are too strong. Can you recall the details of Jin's birth? She's two years younger than you. I conceived her the year after your birth. When delivery got closer, my guts feeling told me： It's going to be a girl again. How did you know it? I wasn't sure, but felt it was a baby girl. No scanning back then. So I talked to your dad. One-Child Policy was at its height. So we decided... that I would have an abortion. Then people said "How could you carry such a late abortion?" But I decided to go ahead because we couldn't have another baby girl. Can you tell me more about that abortion in Xingan Town? We went there. Didn't your mom already tell you? Yes, but I'd like to hear it from you. She must've said it all. I'd like to hear your version. Mom might not recall everything. She knows it better. Just tell me whatever you remember. Jin... she was a tough baby. Your mom got two injections. But Jin survived it all. I was so scared, what if... if it was a boy? We would've regretted it to death. We were told that some herb could help the baby survive the injections. I drank a lot of it. I was taking the herb while receiving the injections. I'm not sure if that is why. But the next day, I gave birth to Jin at 5am. She survived the abortion. Gosh! We heard her cry. The doctor said: Now, what do we do? Do you want her? If not, throw her in that trash. Our mind was blank. We didn't know what to do. "Festivals' Visit" is a tradition in Jiangxi. To show her filial piety, a daughter takes her husband and kids to visit her parents offering them gifts and money, on three important occasions: Dragon Boat, Mid-Autumn and Spring Festivals. Tell her not to come. She doesn't have much money. She didn't mention the red packet. She offered money every time. She knows that you won't take it. She said that she'd bring some fruit. How can I take her money when her life is so hard? She'll bring a durian and a box of milk. Mom, just tell her, if you don't want her to come. Come on! She didn't say she'd come. I find you pretty difficult. She asked Qiong to tell you. Why Qiong? Why not telling me herself? You idiot! Is telling you directly more fancy? Stop making troubles! What do you mean? Am I making trouble? No wonder no one likes you. Yes, no one likes me. Mr. Nice Guy. You are going crazy! - Hi Auntie! - Hi! Why was the door closed? Hi, Xi. It's noisy outside. - Where is Sui? - He is coming. Let's take off the coat, baby. Hi, Auntie! Want some longans, Qiong? Yes, sure. They're pretty good. You want to walk? She's alive. Do you keep her? I said: "Of course I'll keep her." But it was a girl. I wouldn't throw her away since she was alive. Of course, we'll keep her. We couldn't kill her. The doctor told us to dress her. I was too weak to get up after labor. The baby was so alive. I told your dad to wrap her in napkins or blankets. And I had a nap. I napped on the labor bed. Your dad wrapped her up and put her on the bed. I slept a lot before I could dress her. I had baby clothes with me, in case it survived. I was prepared. Did you look at the baby？ Of course I did. What did she look like？ She looked quite like you. How was Jin physically? She was fine. Your dad asked the doctor if the injections harmed the baby. And if it had, was there any antidote? But the baby was fine. There was an aborted newborn in the same room. A seven month-old big boy being casually placed under the bed. - Was he alive? - No, he was dead. Jin was the only one who survived. We had to find a place to hide her. We couldn't take her home. One-Child Policy was in the Chinese Constitution since 1982. The 1990s were the harshest decade of the policy. My elder sister, me and our little sister were born in 1990, 1992 and 1994 respectively. Mom's elder brother, my third uncle, has been a village official since 1996. He was in charge of the local implementation of One-Child Policy. Mid-1990s was the harshest of all time. You parents had to hide away. Nobody was supposed to see them. They would've been arrested. Back then, agreeing or not, you would be sterilized. It was a terrible period. They would take your pigs away, torn down your house, and so on. It was very violent. Were you part of it? I did. You did? Take away pigs, tear down houses. I did it all. Damn it! It was our duty. We had annual quota of women to sterilize and how much fine to collect. All was hard-core stuff to deal with. It eased up these years. I arrested some few years ago. When was the best time to catch people? Before day-breaking. What? Before day-breaking, about 3 to 5 in the morning. You made inspection everyday？ No. It depends. Sterilization is affected by weather. When temperature is high, the wound would be inflamed. And it affected busy farming seasons when people were sowing rice or harvesting. So it depends. But my mom was sterilized during the busy farming season. It was very hard then. The Policy was implemented very harshly then. Back then, we all knew that One-Child Policy was a national policy. It was inescapable. Wash your hands! What are we having for dinner? Mom! Eggplants, what else? We finished the beans. I'll do seedling work tomorrow. Can you look after my son? Qiong, bring my hat over. You throw it over there. What? I want to be with you. It won't be so hot in the field with boots. The simplest things are seedling-throwing and harvesting. That's why we are farmers. It's not you farming. It's my dad. I remember somebody said to me a few times: You work hard here while your two sisters are having fun in the city. I said none of my business. Who said it? I don't remember. Why abandoning you, and not your elder sister? They said that? Yeah, many people asked. I thought about it too. Why abandoning the third, and not the second? Because the policy wasn't so harsh at that time? I don't know. Why do my feet sink so deeply? The soil is sticky. Luckily I was sent here. Why? I'd be miserable in your home. Hard to say. What do you mean? Your relationship with them wouldn't be so bad. Right? You might take my place and I take yours. If you took my place, your mom might like you better. If I were you, I'd be the truly you. Yeah, but you'd be good at study also. You sink. Don't bend down. It's tiring. He isn't going to sleep. He is so naughty, damn it! He cried for more than an hour. No, about two hours. So annoying! How sweet your son is. Beating him didn't work at all. So I just let him cry. His grandma came back at 2 pm. You spoil him to be so naughty. Was I like this too? You cried for snacks. No. You cried for money. Money or trouble. Money could stop your tears. If there was no money, you would cry day and night. Did I cry that much? Of course! You cried and stamped your feet. You never beat me. Did you? You never cried without reasons. You got money, you stopped. You cried for snacks. He cries for no reason. I'm about to fall asleep here. Go to sleep. I will have a rest as well. Taking care of such a kid will kill you. I expect to go through your same experience. Now I'm raising my own child. Raising you almost killed us. Your brother Jun was easy. You were troublesome. Damn! What happened as you left the hospital? We had nowhere to hide, so we turned to your eldest aunt. She didn't like me having another girl. She always looked down upon us. Why did she? Maybe because I hadn't had a son yet. My eldest sister is that kind of woman. She only likes boys. She had been disappointed because you are all girls. That's true. Who does she despise, you or mom? Of course your mom. After staying in her house for a night, we went to a restaurant owned by your dad's friend. We hid there for a few nights until things got worse. We decided to send the baby girl to a family who already had a son. It was an orange garden near by. We carried the baby there and put 30 yuan along with her birth date on a note. Is the orange garden still there? It must have changed a lot. No trees anymore, to give way to real estate development. I remember it's in that direction. Yes. Somewhere near Hu Kao Fang. I know it. Not far from Mao Ernao. And near the vocational school. That way. Right! I know it. There is no orangery here. Let's go further. Near my high school? Yes. We were there at midnight. Let's find the school. It's near Mao Ernao. It used to be a huge orangery. Over there. Some of the trees are still there. This should be the right place. Qiong, I probably placed the baby here. If not this house, then that one. Just around here. There was a dog at the door. I put the baby down and ran away. I'm sure this is it. We found it. We remember it right. Those are the newly built roads. Days later, we thought she had been taken away. So we came back. She wasn't there. I thought she was adopted and I felt a bit relieved. Later, Teacher Zhou came and said: I saw a baby abandoned in front of our school. Alas! It was a bitter pill to swallow. He said the baby was there for days. I was very upset. The baby may not survive this time. Jin was suffering all these. Maybe they found it hard to bear and put her at the school gate. I guess it was the orangery owner. Xiajiang Vocational School Since no one picked the baby, they asked a teacher to take her to the municipality government. How did you find her? We didn't. He went shopping there and saw the baby. After all, people gossip. A baby girl was abandoned. It happened a lot. I heard of many babies abandoned. A relative asked me to take his abandoned baby. I didn't. He waited until someone took it. It was a relief to know that. Many babies died in those days... on the street. Very few people dared to take in babies. Xiajiang Municipality Government At that time I was with your eldest uncle. I was... right across the street. Standing there. I asked your uncle to look at the baby. Because I saw the box. All of a sudden, my tears were running down. It's really over. What should we do? I took a second look. I went to tell your grandma. She's still alive. I saw her. Why didn't you bring her home? How did I dare? I took a quick look and rushed home. Then your grandma forced your uncle to take her. She knew it was too much for me. Back then, Jun was little. I was very sick. Your grandma told him: You have to save her life! You have to! What could you do? Watching her starve to death? He took her home under pressure. I took her from here. I was on my bike then. Jun was on my bike. You went to buy some pig feed. We kept many pigs back then. I got there. And there she was, the crying baby. Oh, she was starving. And it was freezing. Shit! Her toes were all rotten. It was pretty cold. She had a little formula milk. She was soaked in urine. So I asked Jun: You'd like to take the baby girl home? Yes! She was out there for about a week. The first time I saw her she was as small as a fist. I wasn't able to hold her. Any water or milk to drink during that week? There was some water. And glucose and formula left inside her box. I saw an old lady feeding her. The glucose and milk powder were tied tightly together. Who was that? Just an old lady who lived nearby. Near the town hall? Yes. Do you know her? No. Did she feed the baby everyday? No idea. I saw her feeding the baby with a bottle that day. She was out there for exactly one week. She was rotten with holes in her feet. She was destined to survive. Even being starved and cold for so long... She fell sick everyday after getting home. I asked the doctor if she could survive. He said no problem. She got a loud voice and she cried out. So she could survive anyway. He also said that if her voice sounded like a cat's then it would've been hopeless. So she will be fine. Is that snake gone? Run! It's going to rain. It's coming very soon. Dad, turn off your phone! Mommy! Yes! My feet hurt. People told her she was adopted. No! My mom gave birth to me! She asked, why people say I'm Uncle's child and I look like Qiong? I said Yes, you are Uncle's child. What's her response when she learned that you were not her biological parents? She couldn't believe it. What did she say? So I was born in Uncle's family. Why did they abandon me? I told her that Uncle had wanted a son. So girls are less humans? He wanted a boy. Your mom said something... I hated her, maybe not, but I was really upset. I wonder why she would say that. I was so sad, crying and crying. You were not at home. You were in high school. What is it? I didn't tell your mom about my mid-term test. I felt... I was a bit afraid. What your mom did made me more... Actually... I am afraid of them. Every time I visit you, I feel... Maybe it's not fear, but I have mixed feelings. I didn't tell her about my mid-term test. I did give her a hint. I was not good at test. My classmate Ting's grandpa came and told your dad about a parent-teacher meeting. I thought he must know it, so I didn't told him. When your mom heard, she said: A dog is more grateful than you swinging his tail... She said something like this. Pretty much the same. My god! I was heart-broken hearing it. How old was I? Twelve or eleven. Probably twelve. You know how lashed out I felt? I was living with you back then. I recall that your mom told my mom that I hid away from her, I didn't talk to her. I don't have much to say to her, so I avoid her. Your mom told my parents that I hide away upstairs and refuse to see them. I wouldn't even watch TV at your home. We could earn some money by selling the meat. I want you to cook for me. I leave tomorrow. I have to check on the cow. I heard it's dying of heat. Go earn your money. Jin! Yes? What's he up to? Earning money. Earning money. Where is he going? He said the cow was dying. The cow is dying. It's too hot. Really? Dad, if it's dead, get me some beef, I pay it. You got it! Mom, your husband will make money. What for? Where are you going? To check a dying cow. To the store. They called me. My dad will get me everything I want. He never hits me. I remember once. I was little. My brother Jun was in jail. No one could herd cattle. I bargained with Dad. There were few channels on our TV. I said, get me a satellite TV, then I herd cattle. Okay! He agreed. Then I asked him to sell the ox. Because the ox kicked. So my dad sold the ox. Since then, we've kept only cows. My dad never says no to me. Grandpa is just playing with you. Let's go, Yang. Like he played with Yang. Go home. Yang, you have a little brother. What's wrong with it? What are you making this fancy for? Just hang it out! You are so stubborn. Mom! This hanger is too long. Why not using the smaller ones? Don't be picky. It stretched Xi's shorts. My mom is very nice to me. Jin, what do you want for lunch at school? She asked me every morning. All year around. Even now she would still ask. Your mom asked only you, not me. It makes me feel... It's hard to say. I recall my mom asking me. You recall your mom did the same? Yes. Should we fry the eggs first? My parents provide the best. Sui's eggs are not as fresh as these. For settlement, a half is acceptable. He wants you to take the money now? Ask for a receipt. How? Just write down clearly the money you accept. Write the amount there. Just write exactly the amount he gives and how much he still owns you. You don't know how to write a receipt? Half... these Xingan people are really tough. Don't you collect it for every kitchen ventilator sold? My neighbor hasn't had any money for the past two years. Tell them to pay in one-time. It's easier said than done. Jin's father was like after getting drunk. Fuck! They always ask for money... Sui never calls himself. He asks Jin to call me for money. They borrow money everywhere. I am not like Li, though we are both married. She married a rich man. I'm different. Your life is always better. Uncle, how much did you lend to Jin? Many thousands. They borrow here and there. From everyone they know. They asked Nan and Lin? Ten thousand from Lin. Li asked Jin what's the money for. Jin kept silent. Not a word. Hell, her own sister can't talk with her. When you ask, she would groan. And she would keep silent in a sulk. Many of my classmates were adopted. Their biological parents are nice to them. I haven't felt their goodness to me, though I lived with them many years. How did you know about your classmates? They told me in school. They ignored their biological parents, but they treated them well. They don't call them dad and mom. Now they are married and moms as well. It sounds like a soap opera, but it's true. They make me feel cold, how would I like them? Li is the same, she is cold as well. After having my family, I felt an ever greater distance with them. I really don't know how to help her. Giving her money doesn't mean help. It may even mean harm. But she can't... She can't understand it. To her, giving money is doing her a favor. Not giving it... is like rejecting her. Dad and Mom hold different opinions. Dad is afraid that she will hate him if he doesn't help. Mom doesn't care about being hated. In fact, mom wants Jin back and hopes she would change somewhat. She hopes Jin grows up and understands them. I think it's hopeless. She doesn't know. She doesn't understand at all. What can we do? All our effort is a waste of energy. Now it's extremely difficult to ask her to change and understand. Have you thought about... talking to her? I don't want to. She only irritates me. Then how could you expect her to change? I don't know how. Talking to her makes me angry. It only upsets me. You didn't try. I tried. Though not face to face. But she can't understand. She has her way. She looks at things from her perspective and never put herself in other people's shoes. She judges everything with... from her point of view. She never asks if there is another side of the story. Never. Jin is like this. She... She holds everything she hears, sees or feels as true. Let's wait and see. Someday she'll understand. It's a matter of time. Some day, but not now. You stayed at Jin's house? Yes. What about Sui? He slept on the sofa. We didn't sleep much. Their son cried a lot. He cried all the time? Look how skinny Jin is now. The boy cried a few times for milk. Sui's parents never help with the baby. Damn! In 2015, Jin and Sui's shop went bankrupt. To help them, my father invested in an advertising shop for them. Qiong. Where were we? What? Where were we just now? We were speaking of Uncle. Isn't it nice? Did you buy it? Yes. How much is it? 300000 yuan. 300000? Doesn't it look good? Boss! You are the real boss. This is the guest room. Sui could live here for a while. I will have flooring installed. And it will be a nice studio. Of course it will. You got what you paid. You also do web design? We are mainly focused on advertising design and selling calligraphic paintings. Alright! Hold on. Ouch! My ears itch. Especially this one. Uncle's coming. Oh my God! Where is Sui? He went out. Have you sent it? Sui made it with a wrong dimension. What the hell is this! This is not the first time. He is so careless. Now I've to remake the iron frame. He is so unreliable and always messes things up. I don't want to work with that idiot anymore. He is as stupid as a pig. Hi Uncle! Is it 1.43 meters? If Uncle didn't manage this shop, we might not stay in touch anymore. You mean, you and my dad? Sui, me and your parents. You and us? Of course I will be in touch with you, but not with Uncle and Auntie. Will you contact them? No. You were adopted? What? You were adopted? Yes. I was adopted. Adopted by an unrelated family? No, they are my relatives. Oh. I remember you. I guess, you don't remember me? Yes. Does it hurt? Not really. Oh no. We must open it this way? How else can I install the IUD? Keep still. Can I have you take it out from the uterus one day? Sure! I know your parents well. I know, that's why I asked my sister to call you. "Sex selective abortion is prohibited." Do I just take some anti-inflammatories? "Sex selective abortion is prohibited." Yes, just in case. "Sex selective abortion is prohibited." "Sex selective abortion is prohibited." Li. Yes? Do you recall when we were in primary school, there was a bridge on the road to school? Yes, you mean the baby? You remember? Sure! You saw it too? I saw what you saw. I always thought it was only me seeing it. I was erased in your memory. Nope. The scene was too strong. I always remember it. I was very curious, watching the baby carefully. She had a big head and seemed to be furry. Yes. She was very white. Because she was soaked in water. You saw one or two babies? One. But I often saw scenes like that. The same one or different babies? Not the same one. There was an emergency center nearby, they threw babies in the ditch. All aborted babies. All baby girls. Since I decided to make this film I kept thinking of that scene. The more I think about it, the more I feel it was like happening in my dream. Then I ask myself if it's real. So it did happen. "Abortion of a selected sex is prohibited." Almost four months. How many children? Two. Two? Two, oh, three. Three children. Wang Li, right? Yes. Let's not talk in the crowd. Sure. It's a boy. Mine is a boy? You can tell at 3.5 months. Keep it to yourself. Sure, I know. Thank you! What if it's a girl? Then I'd choose abortion. But it's 4 months-old. You can have it in the 4th month. When I delivered Apple, my husband called mom. She told him it's a girl. He just hung up without a word. Long after he called again, asked her how I was feeling. My husband warned me. If I were to carry another girl, he'd have a son with another woman. But he already has a son from his previous marriage. All his friends have more than one son. He doesn't want to lose face. We like eating apples. Apples are good to health. Grandma, I see you in the camera! Oh, you see me. Who's next? Well... Well... This little one! All right. Let's sing. Sing a song. Stop! Not finished yet. Why stop? Is it not good? No. How to sing it then? Oh, no! Come on. Let me help you. She's laughing. I'm wearing lipsticks. Yay! That's enough. Don't put on too much. Your lips are like monkey's bun. Don't touch it! It's so dirty. I want more. Don't get too much. Be a good girl. Which one? This one. Who is this? No idea. Who is this? I have no idea. This is aunt Qiong. This is her. This is mommy. Mommy. Mom. Yes? Is this me? Is it you? Then who is this? Who is this? Take a close look at it. I like this photo so much. Dad took it. Sister. Sister? This is mommy. Dad took it when I was in fifth grade. The sky is overcast with constant thunders. What's going on? It's raining. Yes, It's raining. It's thundering. Yes. What should we do then? Little kids? Going home. Running? It's already raining, we won't make it. Yes. Then what should we do? A kid says: Come on, let's hide under the big tree. Is that right? It's raining. Yes. Then another kid says: No, we can't hide under the tree. It's raining and thundering. Yes, raining and thundering. Thunder will strike the tree. Yes. And raining. Oh, the thunder will strike the tree. Yes. And strike us, right? Yes. And bite us. Oh? It bites? It doesn't bite. So we can't hide under the tree when it's raining? Yes. Raining. The belly is not very big. Is this your third C-section? You are going to have a big family. All right. When is my surgery? It's your turn. Come with me! Bring two maternal mats and one diaper. No need for tissues. Just buy some... maternal mats. Yes, get some maternal mats. On the 4th floor. What if the second baby is a girl? I have no idea. I was ready to die for this baby. How would you think so? Maybe it's because of my first delivery. Giving birth to Wenzhe. Li and her first husband had a son called Wenzhe. A medical accident happened during the delivery. Li had to bear a C-section for 2 hours, with no anesthesia. Due to an serious inflammation after the surgery, her abdomen was cut open for a second time, again with no anesthesia. She was only 18 back then. It was too scary. I lost half of my life there. So I think a third baby may kill me. After delivering the baby, I might die. "Except for medical purpose, sex-selective testing and abortion are prohibited." Sometime I wondered at night. What if I pass away? What about my children? I asked my husband to be kind to my kids if I pass away. And he told me that I was thinking too much. Why would your husband want so many boys? It relates to his family. Could you understand this? Yes, I do. The whole county is like this. Many women went through all this, I am not the only one. There are worse cases than mine. I am just one of many and not the worst of all. Don't you think it's unfair to women? Fair or unfair women don't have a say. You know it's unfair, then what? Can't we change it? Can we? You can't change it on your own. It was done vertically. The C-section was done vertically. The last two operations made it impossible to do it horizontally. One, two, three. Hold him. It's okay. It hurts so much. It isn't easy to be a woman. Exactly, imagine having a baby. How was it when you gave birth? It took me a long time. It took me much longer to give birth. It was more primitive, with no advanced tools. We delivered babies at home. Well... My sister-in-law helped me. Ah, I see. It was common then. It took me much longer time than others to give birth. Especially the first time. First or second. It's the same with me. Which hurts more, a natural delivery or an induced abortion? Of course the induced abortions. Pretty much the same. No way. The induced abortion hurts a lot more. They hurt the same to me. The first induced abortion almost killed me. I was black and blue all over. After how many months of pregnancy? I did it several times. Five month. One in Hainan, one in town. And a couple of girls. What did they look like? I didn't see. They were all wrapped up. Where did they throw them? They used to throw them in the restrooms. I don't know, someone else did. I didn't ask. They were all girls, no boy? I had a boy. I was forced to abort. It wasn't my wish. It's heartbreaking thinking about it. So I don't want to recall it. Like my wife and I, our babies were aborted at eight months. Two babies. The first one was a girl. She was thrown in a bucket crying. I carried her to the woods. I had no choice. She was alive. I left her in the woods. She kept crying. These memories are too sad to be remembered. It's such a cruel policy. Is the wood behind your house? Behind that hospital. It meant killing, you know? The country allowed you to kill. It's all gone. Let bygones be bygones. What else could you do? I think this policy is not reasonable. What about the boy? The second was the same. They gave my wife a few shots. Nothing happened. They gave her more shots. Two days later, she gave birth to a boy. He was alive. I took care of him for three days. Then... He died? You threw him in the woods? Yes. I was in the hospital. He should be twenty by now. All these... We can't blame the country. But I hate the township government. But you still work with them? Yes, I have to obey orders. Since I am in the boat with them. I don't like to talk about the past. After all, I am human, I feel pain. Every night I think about it, I can't hold my tears. Meaningless. Sis, I had a dream. I dreamed of me being sick. A doctor says I have seven days left. But there is an injection that would cause death for only one minute. If I wake up a minute later, I will be healthy and sound. If not, I would be really dead. I try. After the shot, I'm counting. One... Two... Three... Four... When I count to nine, I feel dizzy and my eyes blur. My breath gets slower and slower. Then I can't feel my breath. It seems as I'm in an empty space. Lights off, curtains shut, a dark space. But I know what's happening. I know sis is beside me. The doctor is in front. A flower bed is outside. I feel like a drone in the sky overlooking the whole town. In that space, there is no feeling, no emotion, and no suffering. He is just like a nail. Look at him. I thought grand-uncle gave us 1000 Yuan when Apple was born. It was actually 200. My mother-in-law told me so. Boy is different. 1000 for a boy. 200 for a girl. Isn't it funny? Water delivery is coming. Water runs so fast. Only for three or four days. It's too hot. Of course it's consumed fast. Even faster at my place. A big bottle for one day. Don't push him. Don't push. We start the photo shoot for high school seniors on Oct 8. Damn. The hotkey doesn't work. No. It isn't the hotkey. Look. You need to send it first. Why are you in T-shirt? Put on the pajama. No. I don't want to. Close the door. It's too windy. No. It's so hot. And it isn't too windy. The arrow is still here. Don't keep it. It isn't right. Remove it. After all, we aren't fairly treated. There's so much difference. They bought silver bracelets for Apple. What's for my son? Silver what? Silver bracelets. I didn't ask. And they bought a cradle for Apple. What did they buy for my son? They bought the cradle? I heard it cost 400 or 500 yuan. They bought it even before Li's pregnancy. So I couldn't see the point of my wedding. I even wanted to cancel it. Sui. You know why your son looks thinner? Because he grows taller. Leave me some. Too heavy for you. Where are we going? Let me help you. No. In case you say I do nothing. Bring a stool. Qiong, is it perfectly horizontal? Lower your side a little. Mine? It looks good now. Where's Xi? Now you think of my son. Stay for dinner? I'm starving. Would you stay? Would you? No. Why? Want some beer? Yes. Would you stay? Okay. Sure? Yes. Stay, or I'll kill you. Stay? I will cook carrots. And chicken wings. And a chicken left over from lunch. What else? Potato. You like potatoes? Yes. Xi. Who gave you this? Aunt. Aunt? Oh. Here you are. Give it to uncle? Open it? If you work hard we won't blame you for a bad score. But you never try. How can you do well in an exam? How could you fail if you've studied hard? So many mosquitos. Don't play with scissors! Be careful. It's dangerous. Didn't you say you'd study? I'm doing it. How? By meditation. Stop filming me, or I'll smash your camera. Like on the TV show. Leave me alone. If you don't let me rest, give me a break then. I've had enough! You're so annoying! Come on, let's fight! Oh, stop it! Don't touch me! Go to study. I'm off today. Then no more day off this week. No problem. Leave me alone then. Do you want to study? Alright, I want. My bad. Won't do it again. Will you talk bad about Dad? I will. I won't. Surprise! It's for me? I bought it long ago. You kept it from me. Yes, a surprise. But for myself. Sorry. Sifan, be serious. Let's talk for real. Which sister do you like best? Of course Jin. Why? No reasons. Why not me? Tell me, why not me? I like you all. Why is Jin your favorite? For all the reasons in the world. Tell me the truth. I'd rather not say. She treats me well. How well? She never scolds me, like you do. I don't scold you. You got me in trouble. I was just teasing you. I don't like it. So I get you in trouble and Li scolds you? Yes. What about Jin? She does neither. Do you like her because... our family abandoned her? Right? You feel sorry for her? So you like her best? Are you serious? Do you think that Jin was sacrificed so that you can be here？ What do you mean? For you to be born. Yes. Yes? So you want to be nicer to her? Are you serious? Look at me. I don't want to study. Be patient! What else can you do at this age? Yesterday your teacher called me. You don't listen to anything I tell you. You are so stubborn! He caused troubles to others. What's going on? I didn't! Damn you, why are you so stubborn! I will beat you to death! You are so stupid. How dare you! Who do you think you are? Lou's son was like you before. Now he ranks top 20 in school. Even Yongxin's son made progress. Why wouldn't you learn from them? All you do is play. You know nothing but play! I was already working at your age. You are wasting your life. You shouldn't have been born. I wanted to yell back at him. How? I am fuck you mother! Who taught you? I made it up myself. Oh no. Dad is here. Let's go. I want to see Xi. Let's go anyway! Qiong! My son just saw our pictures and called aunty aunty. So funny! Say uncle. Say uncle. Why are you going home so early? Or my dad will scold me. Why? Afraid of his reproaches? He's always been afraid of you. Ask her, wasn't I scolded today? Doing extra lessons help? It sucks. You don't make an effort. I am not into it at all. Then quit school and be a cameraman like Qiong. Get him a camera, Qiong. Do your father's job. Sifan, what would you do if you quit school? Be a photographer and inherit the store? Beat. You... You idiot. Don't move! Stand up! Sit on the sofa. Don't move! Don't let him step on the floor. Uncle. I'm leaving, okay? Let's go. Uncle will come on Saturday, when he doesn't have classes, so we won't disturb him. It's alright. Go. No. - Say bye bye to aunt and uncle. - No! Ouch! Ouch! Look at him. Just go, Sifan. I'll come tomorrow. Bye bye. How dare you hit me! The beggar is coming. Damn! Just go, Sifan! My mother went through sterilization in 1992 before giving birth to Sifan in 2002. During these years, she had four abortions. The doctor who saved her from sterilization declined my shooting. How did she help you? She was a country doctor and knew people in the hospital. She told them to keep one fallopian tube. They knew that I had several girls and understood my desire for a boy. So the doctor said yes. She kept one fallopian tube. What did the doctor ask you to do? She told me to swell my belly. Then she couldn't find my tubes. If you don't cooperate, the operation won't succeed. At first, she only found one oviduct. She pretended not finding the other one. Then she gave up. That's it! I only remember our maternal grandparents. You don't remember my parents? Your maternal grandma died later. Yes, after a long illness. You took me to visit her. But I was afraid to see her and kept crying, when she tried to hold me. I remember that you asked me to get the buns bought earlier. Yummy. Call grandma. Look at you. It's sour. Do you want more? Want more? Yes? Then call grandma. It's grandma. Yummy. Do you like it? Yes. Call grandpa. Say grandpa. He said Gwanch. Come here. Xi! You naughty boy. Back from grandpa's store. My tooth aches. Did you feed him oranges? Don't give it to him. He isn't allowed to eat oranges. Oranges! Look how dirty your clothes are. You greedy cat. Greedy cat. Why did this door fall down? The door... What? It fell in the morning. Alright. It's okay. Don't cry. Good baby. Don't cry. He wants to sleep. Yes, he does. Do you wanna go to bed? No? You don't? Go. Go. What do you want? Go. Wear some clothes. Come here baby. Put on a coat first. I am not cold. Come. Let mom hold you. What does he want? You wanna go out? I've had this in mind lately: I want my son to call them grandpa grandma. But then I wonder, when he gets older, he may ask Dad, Mom... why do you call grandpa 'Uncle' instead of dad? I've been thinking about it. He might also ask: Why do I have two maternal grandmas and grandpas? I bet he'll ask that too. Remember! Don't look at mom while dancing! Don't lick your fingers. Just focus on dancing. The others will follow you. If you forget your moves, they won't know how to do. You're the leading dancer. Keep up the great work! She'll be at the front. Her teacher said she remembers all the moves. I've always wanted a daughter. So I could dress her beautifully. But when Apple was born， I was disappointed for my husband. Since it was a girl， it was a big blow to my husband who wanted a son. Our Apple is right there. Teachers are lining them up. Let me ask this little one. How old are you? Four and a half. Four and half? You're very young. Why do you crouch down? And stand up? Right! Our show is about to begin. These are kids from junior kindergarten. Let's give them a big round of applause! Little ones, you are the best! Now music on! Come and hold him. A hug. One second. What does he want? Nothing. He wants you to hold him. He stands up when he sees you. He's calling. The rooster is singing. You see it? The chickens look different. Puppy. It hurts Mom. During your last pregnancy have you ever thought that induced abortion is horrible to baby girls? This world is horrible to us too. Every move is a risk. What's the bottom price in your mind? 80000 yuan. You are selling a daughter or what? What are you talking about? Don't say that to your own family. What nonsense! Will you be able to marry a wife for free? Will you say to your future mother-in-law that she's selling a daughter? Don't expect a penny from me when you get married. You are too young too naive! When you get married it's gonna cost a lot more. That isn't just a money thing. Mom, how much will you offer? What? I'll offer nothing. You better mean it. You started the topic. You won't take my money, right? I thought you meant it. Sifan. Earn the money on your own. If only he could. Hell! My dad said 80000 yuan? My mom asked for 100000. It was 100000. Later my dad called Uncle to say 80000. Then Uncle asked for 20 000 more on my behalf. They are making troubles! Always change. From 100000 all the way down to 30000. - Sis, you are hitting the table again. - Don't. Stop it. What else can I do now? You should get money for the wedding from his family. I can't ask for it. You shouldn't. I wouldn't. When Qiong said you came I wondered why your husband didn't come. Ask him to propose it. Tell him the bottom line, then he talks to his mom. He offered 20000. I told him 20000 was too little. Tell him that you aren't cheap. So you're worth only 20000? Even the engagement money was taken away by him. Isn't it true? He kept taking money from your family. Let's put that aside. Now are you as cheap as 20000? How can they be so stingy? Now an engagement costs over 100000. You can't be too stingy with a wedding. Jin, what do you think? How about 50000 as I suggested? Let's settle it down. 50000 is too little. Listen, Sui's mom... Then tell us. I can't sit here all day waiting. Well... Okay... 100000 in total. 30000 was paid for the engagement. Pay 70000 now, to make 100000. The minimum. Okay for you, in-laws? This is beyond our means. You can't even afford 70000? Way too much for us. What do you think? Can you all speak? You paid 30000 yuan. So just pay 70000 more. We must have some money for the wedding. Will you only invite your mom's brothers? The biological uncles should be invited too. They must come. We can ask people with similar experience. In Chinese tradition, at wedding banquets, brothers of the bride's mother are the most important. They should occupy the best seats, so-called "seats of honor". For the fostered daughters, should the seats of honor be for maternal uncles from the foster family or the biological one? Arguments start. I don't think there is a problem. Did any of the uncles bother to visit her? For me, it's okay not to invite them. It's my business. I don't understand your concern. Who ever visited her when she was a child? I know it all. None of them had cared about her. They all knew she was their niece, but did nothing. So it's okay not to invite them. It isn't a problem. They knew she was your daughter. No one even pretended to care about her. I raised her up and they just ignored her. None even bought her powdered milk. Why bring up the past? I'm just saying it. Are you her foster father? Sure I am. The real uncles should be invited. It's okay if you don't want to invite them. We respect your decision. A wedding should be happy. Happy and lively. Aren't the flowers pretty? You're a first-timer. Of course it's my first time. The string is too short. Oh, too loose. Aunt, come in please! They already ate. Mom, look over there. Wow! So beautiful. But too short. You look like sisters. The elder sister and the younger one. I wish I were that young. Mom. Jin, take it. Do you think life is fair to you? I delivered a few more babies. Without One-Child Policy, I'd have kept all of them. But we were also too poor. Why do all rural people have to have sons? I mean why is it so important to have a son? What does it really mean? Sons are always around. Daughters leave us after their marriage. Like your grandma. Even her heartless sons were around to feed her when she needed it. When she had a stroke, your uncles were reluctant, but they took care of her. I couldn't. Not once. I didn't even wash her clothes. I was pregnant with your brother then. I could only go by motorbike to see her at night. I had no time during the day. And I had to hide my pregnancy. See? Sons are sons after all. For better or worse. Yes, this is grandma. Sister. Where is uncle? Where is aunt? Aunt. Where is your aunt? Oh, here she is. And where is the other aunt? Come and have lunch with us today. Don't buy anything. Okay. Good. You should start to learn something, while you are still young. She should work on the design. You should learn to be your own boss. You can't work for others all your life. It would be great if she could design. The wives of other shop owners all do it. You have to be able too. You should learn to take the orders, if Sui is out. If there is an order, but you don't know what to do, it can't be worse. Hold on. Wash it! Use some glass cleanser. It is so dirty around. You should clean up often! Hell! Your dad never talks nicely. Like evil. Got yelled at again? Sui. Never mind. I've gotten used to it. What can I help? That thing. Peel the garlic and wash it. Should we steam the leftover buns? - How to peel? - Buns from yesterday. Tell me how you want it to be peeled. Am I doing it right? Qiong, what should I do? Where should I go? I have no idea. What do you want to do? I don't know. What kind of job makes you happy? I don't know. Do you feel happy working here? It's hard to say. I only know I'll be scolded all the time. What's wrong? I brought a plaque just now. I want to die. Your dad is always angry. He used to call me Jin. Then he started calling me Zhou Jin. Now he doesn't call my name. Today I cleaned up after the air conditioner was installed. Then he came and ordered me to clean it thoroughly. I always felt like I was a cleaner in your home. When I was in school living with your parents, I had to mop the floor on weekends. I think your dad will never like me. No matter how much I do for him, I feel that among the three of us he is kinder to you and Li. I told Sui Uncle wouldn't have scolded him if he had married Li or you. I feel miserable in your family. It's not what I feel. It's what it is. It hurts me so much. Can we get a beer? Dad, will you ask Jin to work in our store? Not before she sends her son back to the village. Why not let her go and find her own job? Where can she find it? You don't even let her try before asking her to stay here. Did you ask her? Ask her what? What's her plan? She has no skills so I want her to learn here. She meant to find a job out of town. What can she do if she leaves town? Who will cook for her husband and son? But can she handle things in the store? If she can't there will be just more conflicts. Set the first color as 177227205. 177277 Is it serious? They look down upon Jin. Who do they think they are? Ask yourself, what did she get after marrying your son? So she gave you a grandson and deserves nothing? Even when she's ill? What kind of in-laws are you? She's in hospital, you don't visit her or give a cent. You don't even have money for her to see a doctor? I don't believe it. We all need to help. If I were you, I would've borrowed for her. No money... Do you think Mom is wrong? I know they care about me. But now it is such a mess. We are trying to reason things out not to have a fight. It'll be awkward when they meet again. Why? We just want to make it clear. You should understand why my parents are so mad. They are fighting for you. They are protecting you. I know. They don't ask the money for themselves. Right? They strived so hard for you despite everything. You know how proud Uncle is. She's going to Nanchang tomorrow? Yes. Let's go see Jin. Now go to repair your shoes then we'll visit her. Okay. Hurry up. I don't want to hang out with you. You always hold me back. Go to ride your motorcycle. Why do we need a motorcycle? Didn't you say to visit Jin? We can just walk, okay? Then I'll cross the market fairs and walk there. I can't help it anymore. Leave her alone. Jesus! The birds are so annoying. Why are there so many birds? Twittering all around. So annoying. Stop it! I know you care about me. The marriage license is here. I'd rather divorce him. So you don't need to worry anymore. Why you insisted to marry him? You think it's easy? I know him too well. I shall burn their house down if they keep fucking up! How could they be stingy to that point? Shit! Sui acts like money isn't an issue. Now you're sick and where's the money? It's been years and you're still broke like shit. Fuck! You and your brother are both shit. Hello! Where are you? I just came out from the store. I wasn't sure if my parents were asleep. So I hesitated to come out. Help me carry my stuff. Where are you going? To sleep in a hotel. Come home with me. No. I won't go to your home. How much do you have to stay in a hotel room? He can gamble. I can spend for an hotel. I hesitated to pay 80 yuan for my son's clothes today, while he was playing cards. Calm down and let's go home. You can't leave home like this. You are not homeless. What is "home"? Life can be disappointing sometimes. No one is perfect. He gambles everyday. Talk to him. You don't deserve the red heart at all. You bit others! Why didn't your teacher give it to you before? You bit someone today and you got the red heart. Tell me, did you bite others? Did you? Speak! Did you bite others? Did you? Did you bite people today? Speak! No? You liar. Why are you holding this? Do you want to eat it? How dare you to put it in your mouth? This is a nail. Can't you see it? It'll harm your mouth. You aren't allowed to eat the snacks aunt bought for you. No snacks! Did you bite others today? Answer me. Tell me the truth. You promised me not to bite people but today you did it again! Do you ever listen to me? Go to your grandma's! Get out! Don't come back! I don't like you. No milk! No food! I told you not to do it, but you never listen. The first one recovered. Now you injured another one. Don't you remember my words? Won't you learn the lesson? Get out of here! No. Mom. Sit naked if you dare. I thought you were asleep. Aren't your hands cold? Look at you, as cool as a cucumber. No school tomorrow? Go to sleep! Stop messing around. Get under the covers now. Stop it! Let's go. Go! Go! Go! Go! Hurry up! Do you want to miss the bus? No! Get your ass back to your dad! Go! Let's go, sweetheart. Hello. What's up? I'm on my way back home. No. Your son played cards till 6 am today. With my son there the whole night. Last time he played for three nights and I didn't say anything. Today, I called him at 6 am, when I got up. He was still at the last round. With my son there! Let's go, baby! I'd rather go back to rice drying than staying with him. He's hopeless. Hurry up. Sorry, mom yelled at you. I'm so sorry. Come. Mom was too angry just now. Jin should let us know what's going on. She should talk to us. She can't always bear it alone. And she can't solve it herself. Did she give Sui the money we gave her at the wedding? Do you laminate photos? Yes. Does she keep it to herself? She doesn't even know the PIN. I didn't tell her the password. No. You told her. What? You told her the PIN. I didn't. I remember you did. No. When was that? I didn't tell her. You did when she got in the car. I didn't say anthing. I remember mom didn't say anything. Wished her not to withdraw the money. She's so stupid to give all money to her husband. She trusted him so much. She didn't expect him to cheat her. This is the main reason. He cheated her all the way. He did cheat her. He didn't say anything true. Have you used all the money your parents gave you for the wedding? She said they had. What about the money we gave you? That they might not have. You have? Have you? On that bank card? Yes, we have. All of it? Yes. Oh, no! Didn't we tell you to keep it for yourself? How could you be such a fool? Where has the damn money gone? How did you spend so much? We invested in the shop. In your shop? How come you're still in debt? What kind of business is it? No, your husband lied to you about the money. He's going to take away all your money. We've warned you not to let him touch the money, no matter what he said. You never listened to us. You believed all he said. Bullshit. He'd have taken it all, even if you had more. He's a fucking loser! Get lost. I want to walk alone. I'll walk with you. Stop filming me! I've had enough. Three daughters. Oh, I shouldn't have counted myself. I'd never say I'm their daughter. I've always had this in mind: I'm the worst. He despises me. He despises my mom. You all seem to be so kind to me. You know him. He's like that to all of us not just to you. Well, I've told you it's just not the same story. With that kind of attitude, I would never ever get close. Then tell him. I won't. Let him know your decision. I don't want to speak with him. I've had enough. Especially dealing with your dad. If you don't like it here, just leave. Your mom wants me to settle down here. But I've always wanted to be away from you all. I shouldn't have come back. Dad really cares about Jin. But she can't feel it. She might see it, but she can't feel it in her heart. Or she feels it, but pretends not to. Maybe Sui has bewitched her. She can't feel it because of Sui. I think what Jin wants and what dad gives her... Are different? Not on the same level. Jin wants Dad to love her as much as her father does. She's used to that kind of parental love. But in our family she hopes Mom and Dad can be even more caring. But they... She already has a child. She is a mother now. In her heart... I don't know how to say it. Jin... I don't like Jin's attitude. She's a mother herself and should've empathy. She's just too childish. She needs to grow up. She's childish. She needs to act like a real mom. Perhaps since she learned about her birth, she was trying to get back what she had missed. If I were her, I'd be like that too. Destiny. Cool! It's so hot. Tomorrow I want to ride the motorcycle to school. Dad. What about sending me some money. I don't have much left on my WeChat. Only 100 Yuan left. Then give me 50. One half for each. What do you want money for? I just need it. Okay. I'll send you later. I want it too. Ask Qiong to help with your English. No talking. Mom, we're doing an interview. Oh, go ahead. Leave us alone. I won't disturb. Close the door. - You trim your toenails? - What? Please go out. Come on! Go on. I won't cut in. But you can hear us. So what? That's a secret. You are rushing me nowhere. Don't do it in my room. I'm going to your room. Close the door, mom. So no one is allowed in? Jin thinks you don't want to talk to her anymore. She misunderstood me. She thinks you are mad at her. I am mad at her husband. I feel sorry for her. For whom? Jin. But you don't talk to her. You seem to ignore her as if you dislike her. How should I explain it? I really want her to divorce. Then she will come back. A divorce may not bring her a better life or bring her back to us. In a few years she'll return home if life isn't good there. She may come back if she sees her husband's real face. I think she will regret one day. If... If we can change the way dad treats her she will possibly be happier. She would've been happier if she hadn't married Sui. It's all Sui's fault. So you think mom, dad, all of us have no responsibility? Yes, we do. So we can't put all the blame on Sui. We are all part of it. No one is innocent on this. My fault is that I didn't find a solution. You didn't help me. This is your fault. Dad is always abusive and hurts everyone. This is his fault. Jin needs to be stronger to bear this. She'll be fine if she gets used to it. It's not her fault. I wonder what would happen if she hadn't been sent away. Where are you going? You're going to take a plane. You fly. I want to go with you. You can't, baby. You need to study. Where to study? Say bye bye to Mom. Say bye bye to aunt. Bye. They are going to work. Yes, they're going to make money. They go to work. Yes, work and make money. Bye bye! Bye bye! Be a good boy, sweetheart! You as well. Jin and Sui left town to try their chance in a big city far away. Got any more questions? Do you have questions for me? I've been filming you all the time. Now you film me. What if I mess it up? Don't worry. I have no one else to talk with. I don't know where to go. I have nowhere to go. A stranger should've adopted me rather than my father. Why? Then you parents wouldn't have looked for me.
