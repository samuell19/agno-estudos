EXCURSION Listen, boys. You all know what sort of a war we're at. We all fight alike for our parents, children, wives. We're here committed to one cause. Motherland is going through a hard time. And so are we. The war is rough. We have to be rough, too. It is merciless. There's no war with pity or mercy. And the post befallen to us is paid with blood. Prior to us others were here. They sacrificed themselves. Now it's us. But you should well know your turn will come, too. Stratos... Bear this in mind. Whatever happens I'll be the winner. I love you... Did you hear me? I said, whatever happens. I love you. You were late. I didn't want to come. I cried a lot. You love him? It's different with him. Do you hate him? Love and mercy are incompatible. He has no idea. He loves you. You saved his life in that ambush. That ambush... I should have let him be killed. The other day he asked me why I come here. What did you answer? That it's quiet. I waited for you and thought you wouldn't show up. Stratos... What's wrong with you tonight? Nothing. He said something about you leaving tomorrow. Yes, we are, in the morning. There's no other way. I have a mother, too. And a wife. And you have children. They all want us and are waiting for us. But we should know that we may never see them again. What do you want, Stratos? I don't want him between us two. That's it. - What's this look you're giving me? - Not sure. I'm scared about tomorrow. Swear it. Will you be careful? No such oath counts. No one knows what's coming to them. I dread at your absence. I plead. No use for peading! You hear? I came that close many times and I pulled through. You won't be rid of me that easy. You're pretty, Irene. Is that why you love me? That, too. We have to be winning so as to remain alive. It was neither me nor you not Motherland either, who wanted this war. But it did happen. We now must be ready to face everything. Irene (Eirini= Peace). You carved this on that day... I thought you wouldn't show up. I always think you won't show up. I waited and cursed until night fell and you still were not here. It wasn't possible. Kostas was at home. You know he was away at the time. I was alone. And you didn't want to come. That's why you didn't. Shortly, you too as well as myself may simply be brains spilled in the dirt. But that doesn't count at all. Questions, anyone? You're here, Kostas? Did I wake you, Irene? You'd left the light on, I lost track of time. I waited for you, I wasn't asleep. When is your unit leaving? In the morning. - You must be tired, Kostas, I'll make something... - No, no. Didn't you go out today? I walked as far as the river. It was chilly so I came back. Spring's here but it's still cold. Will you... ...go far tomorrow? Yes. Yesterday two cars exploded. But how? Nothing was left of them. Remember that sublieutenant? Yes. Only his watch was found. Those damn mines, if you step on them nothing's left of you. Kostas... You think this war will last? Who cares? It'll end, too. What has a start, it also has an end. What are you thinking about, Kostas? Stratos. I've known him long already but still I haven't figured him out. A strange man. All I know is that he has noone in the world. He saved my life twice. When you thank him he looks the other way. He's the first to start out on the most dangerous missions. I've scarcely ever seen a braver man. On other occasions, however, he's rather worthless. I can't explain it. Once he accused a fellow officer in the battalion for something he hadn't done. They found out he was lying. He was court-martialled. They asked him why he had lied. What did he say? He was looking into their eyes saying nothing. They asked again, he wouldn't answer. They all knew what his contribution to the army had been. - They acquitted him. - Why did he do it? I never understood. What is it, Irene? Why aren't you eating? Nothing. - Hello, Stratos. Everything ready? - Everything. - Good morning. - Good morning, Irene. Let's go, Stratos. They'll pass through here. This is where we'll ambush. You'll spread out on both sides of the road. Let them pass us by, I'll attack first. I sometimes recall how Irene and I met. You know, Stratos... With her, it's always like that first moment. And this love get more powerful with time. I wake at night when she sleeps and watch her. For hours. I can't get enough of her. To me, Irene is the whole world. When I was tranferred to this town I told her not to come. To stay with her family. She didn't even want to hear about it. I now remember what she told me. Your life is mine too. And if you shouldn't exist one day I won't exist either. We'll split here. I'll take 3 men and look around the road carefully. They may have planted mines. If they're not here within the next hour, we'll be back. Takis! The Lieutenant's been hurt! It's alright, Sergeant. In 4 or 5 days he'll be fine. - How many? - 4 or 5. Is he a friend? A friend. Married? Stratos... Kostas? Where is Kostas? Stratos, talk to me! Don't get upset, Irene. This day... ...it was his turn. Speak, tell me about it! He was killed. What did you say, Stratos? A mine. It blew him to bits. It's a lie... A lie... This cannot be... Courage, Irene. It is so. Where do they have him? What's to have? Nothing was left. We started there together. We'd gone for an ambush. The battalion got the word that the enemy would pass that way. They sent us. It wasn't the first time. We hid by the trees and waited. They wouldn't show up but we kept waiting. At some point... At some point, Kostas took 3 men. I asked him where he was going. To the other side, he said. We'll attack them from both sides. Don't go, I told him. This area is full of mines. He laughed. I'm familiar with them, he said. I stayed there and he went forth. In less than two minutes, we heard the explosion. We all ran to him. As I went nearer, I saw. There was nothing left. A mine, one of those that blow huge cars to pieces. It blew him to bits. Irene... You always said... You always said it would be different if it was just the two of us. I know. He was your husband. It's not easy. But perhaps you too wanted this to happen. One of the two had to be killed, to be gone. Listen to me. One of the following days they may send me to the operations. I know where this will be. It's the most dangerous mission. I know this kind of missions. No one survives them. It's a passage on a mountain that I'll have to guard. Whoever retreats is executed. It's a definite suicide. We must leave, Irene! If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't mind getting killed. After selling my skin for a good price. But now the borders are nearby. A day and a night's walk. I'm going to desert. I know the paths by heart. We'll get away. They won't get us. If I stay here, if we stay here, we're done for. I'll be killed, I'm telling you again, that's for sure. And if I perish since you love me, you perish too. No, Stratos. No? Did you say no? Yes. I love him. I don't know, Kostas. I didn't want this love. It seized me by itself. I thought... It'll pass... And it kept drifting me along. I tried to tell you but... I couldn't. None of us clearly saw how this thing happened. Neither I... Nor you, Kostas. Stratos didn't, either. I was unhappy and happy at the same time. I didn't know what exactly I was. Even now, I don't. In a single moment everything changes. That night with the gramophone I meant to tell you. I wanted us to go away. When you were with me he was always there, too. I believed something was missing from our love, from the first moment. From the beginning up to the end, one story... Irene! Irene... We should leave... Stratos! How's the Lieutenant doing? Heard anything? - Where's your mind wandering? - Nowhere. You must go and see him. I'd go, but... but he knows you well. You're his friend. In the morning a soldier is bringing in some medicine. I'll go with him. How's his wife, you seen her? I sent someone for her yesterday. But he didn't find her. She's off to her kins. I lied to her, so that she wouldn't be scared. What did you tell her? That the platoon was ordered to advance towards an unknown destination. And she believed you? She did. Hi, Stratos. Hi Kostas. - How are you getting along? - Looks like I made it. Does Irene know? I kept it from her. You did well. What did you tell her? That you were ordered to subtitute for another man in the operations. and... you'll be away for a while. She believed you? At first, no. But the battalion confirmed it. They sent someone who told her the same thing. Irene's fine. You... How are you doing? Do you drop by and see her? I did for the first two days. Now she's gone south, to her kins. Why? I spoke her into it. Why sit here on your own? Get on a train and leave. At first, she didn't want to. How would she receive your letters? Don't worry, I'll send them to you, I told her. I didn't know when you would come round. It almost slipped off my tongue. Sit. You did well to come. Last night I thought I was the only one saved. How did you get me here? On a jeep. Strato... What is it like outside? As you knew it. Has anything changed? Irene... If you love me why are we not leaving? For your sake, Stratos. For your sake. You won't get away, they'll arrest you. The war will end. Then we'll be together. Kiss me. Hey, Stratos! They've brought the Lieutenant in the hospital. He asked for you to go see him. That time... That afternoon when I first came to meet you it was springtime, remember? I was wearing those sandals. I threw them away two days ago. They're useless anymore. I was late. You said you would be waiting because you knew I going to come. Then you embraced me. I loved you. Nothing has changed since then. It is all like that first moment. Every time you leave I feel like I'm losing you. This fear an inexplicable knot right here. Everytime I try clasping you a piece of glass between us. Although I know already if we're to perish we'll perish together. If I had never met you, Stratos, would it have been better? I'm dreaming... I'm dreaming of an excursion, the two of us... by the sea... If he was alive... what would you do? If he was alive it would be different. Do you know we're about to go on the most dangerous mission? I know. Your battalion consider you to be really brave. They've brought him to the hospital. He's waiting for you. Stratos did well not telling you the truth. If he'd told you I was injured you'd be distressed. That's why he told you I was sent to the operations. Any letters for me? At the house, no. Here? None here, either. Stratos hasn't written to me. What's become of him, I wonder. Who knows? Heard anything? Who from? He should have sent me a couple of words. What are you thinking? If you had gone along with him... wouldn't you be in danger? I would. This is the worst moment of the war. And the unit, where it's been sent, quite unsupported. Is it possible that they all get killed? Not all. But most of them will. Does it still hurt? It's just a little numb. It'll go, too. I meant to tell you... What, Kostas? I woke up last night, I couldn't sleep. A thought crossed my mind... If I'd been killed that day, what would you do? Why ask me that? You could get married again. Be with someone else. That's what I was thinking about. Why think of such things? You have recovered now. Irene... Do you love me? I love you. Stratos... Irene... What were you thinking? Nothing. I was just waiting for you. What is it? I told you, nothing. Sergeant. If you get killed you want me to give any message to anyone? Not to anyone! The sun hasn't set yet but it looks like night to me. Go home, Irene, make a few preparations, we'll go to the town. I'm out of hospital tomorrow. I've been given a month's leave. Irene! I have deserted! You're coming with me! You'll go after him with 3 men. He has deserted. And this means death during wartime. He's clever and peculiar, beware. Altough he's fond of tops he'll attempt to escape through lower pathways. I know him well enough. He's very often fought by my side. He didn't desert out of fear. There's another reason. Most likely he'll try to cross the borders. He won't escape you. He mustn't. You must get him alive. If he tries to get away execute him on the spot. Just one request. The sergeant is a friend of mine. If possible, someone else could fill in for me in this mission. I cannot possibly kill him. No! It's you who'll go! We're not asking about what you want. I told you what has to be done. No second thoughts. It is an order. That's when I first saw you. You were coming to collect us at the station. You were already late. We'd been waiting for you. Kostas had talked to me about you. You were his friend. You had saved his life during combat. And I imagined you as being a man that tall, strong, sullen, inapproachable. When he said "here he comes" and I saw you nearing us I thought of it as so funny... You were like a child, I didn't value you really. I was so happy standing by my husband, what could you be for me, at that time and what did you become later... How many times haven't I recalled that moment... How many times haven't I searched in it to find the beginning of our love... I never found anything. I had my own universe then. You didn't exist. So... you came into my life like something I didn't evaluate. I can hear his laughter again... That laughter of yours... My laughter... I was cheerful. Genuinely cheerful that day. I couldn't have guessed that the road we were taking would finally lead the two of us to this point. If I had... known at the time... I might have been scared. But now I have no regrets. It's daybreak. How did the night pass... One more day and night to go. You think they may be after us, Stratos? They must have been notified about me by now. That's why we're taking secret paths. Besides, this is the only way we can cross the borders. If we get there, there are 3 passages, one of which is unguarded. But if they suspected we're going there they may be following us. Are you scared? About you. We'll lose them. They can't get me that easy. Remember that moment, Stratos. When all three of us rushed into the sea. They've passed this way. They must be hiding around here somewhere. You think they may get away? No. I wish they do. Why? Because. Are the borders far yet? Close. We're very close. They'll wait for daybreak. They can't cross by night. We'll wait, too. I'm going back to the beginning. When we played with the swing. It was your idea. You climbed up there and set it up. You said it was your favorite plaything when you were a child. Later I was very often tormented by this back-and-forth between the 2 of us. I would dream about it at night and get frightened. I'd dream about you grasping the rope, stopping the swing and holding me in your arms. It's definitely you, isn't it? you shouted. Then you dropped the rope as if it burned your hands and that back-and-forth would start again. I don't want to keep it from you, even now, it is still tormenting me in the same way. We may both have cut off that rope, we may have departed for good, with no return but all these things are there still and I only love you. In spite of having no regrets. Every time I met you I wished it was the next-to-last time I did so but when you'd walk away from me I was overcome by the fear of your disappearance, your leaving. Like that day when we lost your traces for quite some time when I suddenly saw you diving from the mast far away I sighed with relief. And I wanted to disappear myself, to go away, to never see you again. It never crossed my mind that you could be feeling the same way I did but I wanted it to be so. I was occupied by the thought that I couldn't bear it if in this game we two played, you were indifferent. That's what you seemed to be, indifferent. As he was setting the tripod to take a photograph of me he called out to me: Move forward! Why have you vanished, Irene? It suddenly occured to me that he knew everything. I felt all alone out there at the pier's end as if I were standing at the edge of the world. Again I felt like running, leaving and vanishing. This smile he was about to photograph would be a fake one. Like everything around me had started being fake. Even you. When you came and posed next to me you looked like another person to me, one I had never seen before. I was overwhelmed by loneliness all of a sudden. I felt like crying. I wanted noone around me just as the camera was taking a photo of us, carefree and content. And then, my husband walked up to me, embraced me as I stood there, he kissed me. I recall those excursions. They look like moments of an hour to me. They brought the two of us together more and more. Nothing could ever stop what we both knew was going to happen. Nevertheless, without having said anything to one another and while also struggling to avoid what we both wanted, we looked quite relaxed and content. Whereas in fact the circles around us were constantly closing in. I had noone else to talk to about it but you. Those happy laughters of our companionship, those joyfully smiling eyes, those meek afternoons by the summer sea had started strengthening our love. Even before we decided to. It's getting dark... Stratos... It's getting dark. Water... Water... An excursion. Excursion... With you... With you... Sergeant... Sergeant... An excursion... Are you alright now? You ran a fever. You were raving. About what? Were you scared? That was a lovely day. So lovely that I said we should go there again. And then you shouted out jokingly that you wouldn't go there again. And you rushed off swimming far away from the shore. You couldn't be seen. I couldn't see you. And then, unexpectedly something clutched at my heart. It was like the daze the sun gives you in midsummer. You close your eyes yet you see it again. Its bright white light shining through your closed eyelids. Insisting on being there even when you don't want it. I felt a fear. I thought that the whole thing was a foolishness. Some folly of mine. Soon the sky would be clouded, we wouldn't go down to the sea anymore, we would part and it all would end. Then it was up to me to decide telling you what we both knew. My egotism took over and I said to myself, no! I'll wait until you speak first. But the grief about the summer's end was already too much. That evening we went back to town silent and hasty. - Were you familiar with the sergeant? - Yes. He was a good friend of her husband's. In love such things don't count. It goes straight to your head and that's all there is. What if he tries to escape? Or he doesn't stop? Shall we shoot him? They want him alive. But if he doesn't stop... Shoot him. No matter what, he mustn't get away. That's our order. And our duty. If they kill me what will you do? When did this happen? Coming back to me now are more images from the days of that excursion. Several trivial instances that connected me with you. Quite often we seemed to forget the love tormenting us. We'd dash into a desperate move with no other thought so as to, supposedly, live and enjoy... But you know it well, too. All this image of joy and carefreeness was nothing but that one moment which was trying hard to conceal the truth. Are you tired? Be strong now. We're almost there. We're there. This is where the forest ends. The passage is this way. There's a dried up river with trees on both sides. We'll wait for morning light. Crossing by night is dangerous. We must be able to see ahead of us. It was the last time we ever went down to the sea. It was the first time you would ever kiss me. There was a pier in the distance. You suggested we swam to it. I reached it first. Then you arrived and climbed up on it. Without a word you embraced me. I can't even remember how long I was kissing you for. And it is like we just remained like this, in the middle of the sea, ever since. The two of us on an excursion. Just the two of us. On an excursion that isn't over yet. The passage is ahead of us. We'll guard all four spots so he won't find a way out. You think he might surrender? No. He knows what's coming to him. What a pity, sergeant. You won't be spared. You regret it? I'll walk ahead first. You'll follow me. We'll crawl on the soil. So as not to be targets in case they're still after us. Only one person knows of this passage. A sublieutenant. We were together in the operations. You must do as I do. If I lay down you lay down. If I run you run too. If they notice us they'll first shoot once in the air. This will mean that we have to surrender. To go back. Back? Stratos... If we survive and time passes, all this will look like a distant story, like a fairytale, won't it? Yes. If we survive. On that night the sea was still and the beach deserted. The summer was almost over and I knew that I couln't keep it any longer. I had to reveal to you not my love, you knew that already but something else. That this story of the two of us would have a different ending from what usually happens. And I felt sad, restless and happy. When you looked at me I knew I couldn't do otherwise. I was weak right there before you. Yielding to that decision of us both. You got the idea but you kept back. Or perhaps you hadn't believed yet, perhaps you didn't want to believe what was coming. What finally came. This is the passage. We're done. Don't be afraid. English subs by neverever for KG (Nov 2014)
