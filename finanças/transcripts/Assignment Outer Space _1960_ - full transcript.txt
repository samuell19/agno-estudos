Clear the launch pad. Minus ten Contact. None of the scenes in this film unfold on that planet in the solar system known by the name Earth. The story of this film is set in the future, when the great human adventure of the conquest of space has become a reality. And men founded new colonies and prepared to push themselves beyond their own solar system. Space Ship BZ88, which has left an Earth base is travelling towards Space Station ZX34 in order to spread further out into the heavens. The crewmen, in order to overcome the attraction of Earth, have been placed in hibernation. The human organism has been through a freezing process that has caused an apparent death. Then suddenly, obeying the instructions of an electronic brain, the heart begins to beat again. The lungs recover their function. Blood flows again. Man slowly reacquires his faculties and his vital capacities. Everything returns to normal, except his weight. Because of the lack of gravity, man moves lightly, restrained by the soles of his special magnetic boots. Now he is a spaceman. A man of space. BZ88 calling ZX34. BZ88 calling ZX34. Over. ZX34 to BZ88. Contact established. Hibernation period finished. Over. - Is that you Al? - Yes, Richard. Is there any news? The usual nausea when awakening, old boy. Z88 has entered your satellite's orbit. BZ88 closing electronic brain. - Over. - Everything's in your hands again, Al. That's a great news. We have cargo aboard. We've already been informed. A reporter. Has he woken up? Think about it. I've got to bring him his coffee. BZ88 requesting your position. Coordinates pica - pi - 27, over. I'll send you the reporter as soon as possible. BZ88 closing. Hello Archie, how are you feeling? - This time I even dreamt. - Really? What about? I dreamt I was sleeping. Take over the controls while I wake up the little one. Is it true when we took off, you sang him a lullaby? Yes, I'm the space wet nurse. Next time, just bring a cow along. A dummy will do. BZ88 to ZX34, over. ZX34, we read you. Hello there, astronaut. Did you have a good sleep? The cradle was too small. Couldn't you have found me a bigger one? We didn't have one, flea. - Why do you call me a flea? - No offence, But here you're just a parasite. - Where are we? - Outside. - Outside what? - Outside everything. - Breakfast is served. - BZ88, you're directly in line with us. Look sharp. We'll send you that reporter as soon as possible. Al, they want the boy right now. Al, what's happening? - We're off to a bad start. - Calm down, my boy. You'll get along fine if you control your nerves. There. From now on, you'll be able to hear everything I say. But don't do it like before, remember your regulator. You're forgetting the tools of your trade. - What's the matter, reporter? - stop it. Are you afraid, perhaps? Stop treating me like a novice. But that's what you are, little one. I took the accelerated course before I came aboard. Too accelerated. I won't take all the air out of the airlock. It'll make your exit easier. I'll count from twenty to one. - At one you go out. - I know all that. Son... you don't know anything yet. Don't put your hand on the frame. Minus 20. Do you see me, Al? But they all do that the first time. Minus... 15. I can already imagine what I'll experience and see. You'd do better to be careful of what you can't see, son. Don't call me son. IZ41, are you ready? Minus five... four... - Wait a moment. - Two... One... Out, flea. IZ41. IZ41. Do you receive me, over? - Do you see me? - Of course. I see you on my screen. At this moment, you're not very photogenic. - Stop it, Al. - You know, you're really ugly. - Perhaps you are afraid - Right, again. - Of what? We released you in a way that'll take you straight to the satellite's airlock. I'd like you to see how ugly you look upside down. - Al, Al. - Would you like me to tell you a story? - Explain to me what's happening. - Try to explain it to yourself. Are you still afraid? - Of what? - Of nothing. Are you still there? Say something. You talk. You have a nicer voice than mine. I don't see colours any more. Just an opaque veil. Without light. Cold. - Lift up your visor. Al, I feel a sense of cold emptiness. - Do you understand me Al? - Of course I understand you. Every baptism is mysterious. Even out here in space. I have never felt so alone. Maybe if I try to turn around... I did it. I'm turning here. I can manage to do it if I want to. - Don't do it too much. It's extraordinary, Al. Marvellous. - Look, you should stop. You know a lot, old man. Now shut up. I've learned to fly. PZ41, try to straighten up instead, you've arrived. On entering the artificial satellite, Ray Peterson reacquired, little by little, moving in the decompression chamber, the sense of his own weight. The two extremes of the space station, rotating around a central axis, in fact create, by centrifugal force, a gravitational field. The environmental conditions typical of Earth are now perfectly reproduced. Ray Peterson feels once again at his best. Take off your space suit and report to the Commander He's waiting for you. Hey, what kind of man is our reporter? He still smells of Earth. Special correspondent Ray Peterson, reporting to the Commander. I've heard you're rather famous on Earth. I see my fame... has climbed to the stars. - Right, I'll give you some advice. Here among the stars, it's better not to put on lots of airs. You've come to work. - I have nothing else to do but my job. On condition that your work don't interfere with ours. You've arrived at a time that's not very tranquil. So much the better. The news isn't interested in tranquillity. How long to reinstall the terminal stages on the ship that just arrived from Earth? That depends. We've only two mechanics aboard. Cancel all leave. The ship must be ready as soon as possible. I must go to Base 12 on Mars. You talk about Mars as if it were just around the street corner. There are no streets here. I was opposed to your... unwelcome visit. Do you really want to flatter me? But the department didn't listen to me. - It seems you have quite a pull there. - Not me. My organisation, rather. Don't forget, Peterson, everything you record will have to be censored by me, personally, before it is sent back to Earth. - I note that you're a liberal spirit. You'll learn that here everything is different. Liberty and democracy are Earthly sentiments. Here everything is regulated and controlled by machines, which are neither liberal, nor democratic. - What a pity. - There's nothing I can do about it. And there's more. These machines try to conform to the mechanical laws of the universe... ...which are neither liberal, nor democratic. I see you're beginning to understand me. You may go. You'll be shown your quarters. The crew is ready. Any counter-orders? What's all this movement? A trip to the countryside? The crew's going to work in space. What if I wanted to go along? To get a bit of air? You'd need to ask for authorisation from the Commander. - Is it necessary? - Absolutely. Watch out. A meteorite. What's happened? Close the fuel valve. Lost. 500 gallons of hydrazine. - Lost. - I'm sorry. Furthermore, you went out without my permission. I beg your pardon for having saved a man. You're not here to play the hero. The damage you've just caused is more serious than the loss of a human life. Evidently, commander, I still have a prehistoric mentality. I thought nothing was worse than the loss... of a man. Of a number... Y13. I didn't even see his face. Perhaps it isn't there. I knew that you were going to give me trouble. You're a psychologist too. Listen, Peterson. Be very clear. From now on, you'll need permission for whatever you do. - And you won't ask me. - That's already an improvement. You'll ask my second in command. From your point of view, you'll find he's tougher than I am. You may go. First, Commander, tell me... why do you deny me the honour of talking to you? I'm leaving, Peterson. K116, please. Pardon me for not having called you by name. I am IZ41. What do you want? I'm looking for a man. Excuse me, I'm looking for a number. Y13. He was injured. He should be here somewhere. Already dismissed. It was nothing but simple shock. You can look in the biochemical lab. Please excuse my curiosity, Mr. K116. May I come in? Hey, spaceman. Talking to me? Yes, but you... I didn't think... that you were also a florist. But these aren't flowers. They're called diasporas. Even with a name like that, they're flowers. They're used to change hydrogen into breathable oxygen. It's as necessary for life here as the air is on Earth. If you ask me... they're flowers. As you wish. Are they for sale? I'm afraid they're really not. Perhaps we could come to an agreement. In what way? Well... You won't need to send them anywhere. I'll pay for them, but I'll leave them here... For you. You work in this section? Only sometimes. But I'm really a navigator. When I'm not on duty, I like to substitute for the crew chemist. But tell me, why do you want to offer them to me? No particular reason. Only to celebrate the second smiling face I've run into. After old Al, there are none but you. By the way, what's your name? Don't tell me your number, serial or code. But your real name. - Lucy. - Do you like it? It's not bad. My uncle had a mascot with your name. Very sweet. I liked it a lot. It was a monkey. Really very cute. I'd think it was a compliment. I'm very flattered, Mr. Peterson. You know my name? But of course. I was told by George, you know? I mean, the Commander. A friend. But, the Commander... Doesn't he have a number, like all the others? For me, no. And now, will you excuse me? I've a lot to do. Y13. I forgot. Thank you Ray. Such happiness. I can see you enjoy smoking. I smoke only because it's my turn to smoke. But I can assure you, Al, that I'll lose this habit too. So, to that end, one for old Al. You remind me of the pleasures of Earth. - One of mine, Al - Gladly. But I want yours as well, Barry. Sullivan has sent for me. I like to make him wait. - What fun. Why? I hate punctuality. If the commander could hear you. He says that punctuality is the first law of space. Laws are there to be broken. - Nice smoke, Al? - Of course. You can stay here too. There's news for your pupil. - Peterson? What's he done this time? - Nothing. Why don't you invite him for a trip in the space taxi? We're entering the zone of the asteroids. - You've decided to be nice to him. - I dunno. It's the commander's idea. I understand. He wants me to take him for a trip to keep him out from under his feet. Could be. And if you want my impression? - But of course I want it. It's really like this. I believe the commander has decided to be gentle. Excuse me, Mr Sullivan. I meant the commander can be fair, but not gentle. I appreciate your honesty, Barry. Even if it's not properly respectful. IZ41, we've made it. I believe this will be the most interesting action shot of your career. Yeah, photographing these rocks. These aren't rocks, sonny. They're asteroids. Each 700 feet in diameter. The commander balled me out for the 500 gallons of hydrazine, lost to save a life. And it was a girl's too. Have you a weakness for the weaker sex? A girl who calls him George. By all Saturn's rings, they were right to call you a meddler. Well, he's ashamed of that. Hang on, I'll make a sharp turn. - Who's ashamed? He's ashamed of his feelings for Lucy. He wants to be perfect. And because he isn't, he forces himself to be, and ends up being it. - It's impossible to explain to you. - You mean it's impossible to understand. Is it true that George is leaving? - Will Lucy go with him? - I'm sorry for you. She's going with him. Very serious things are going on. And you loose yourself in nonsense. We're going to Mars. - You too Al? - Don't you want to tell me more? - Top secret. ZE34 to space taxi B91, hurry back to base. Over. B91, received. - Al, can we communicate with Earth? - Of course. - Do you think we're still in the 21st century? Better duck, we're going back into the satellite. I don't understand. Why is the pilot so late? - He said he'd join us immediately, Sir. - Al's really a strange type. - He's the best there is. - I'm sorry to be late, Sir. - We've been waiting for you. The situation's deteriorated. We leave immediately. And you haven't managed to contact A2? A2 does not answer. It's feared the pilot may be dead. - This could mean the end. - That's what I'm afraid of. IZ41 is asking to speak with you, Sir. He should ask the second in command. You listen to him, Sullivan. He refuses to do so. Says he has an urgent communication for you. That's all we needed. That nosey, interfering meddler. He's a good chap. You think so? - It's absurd. - Commander, you're insulting the Central Department. - It's utterly against all regulations. - Any more criticisms? I have some too, but I keep them to myself. Gentlemen... prepare to leave. Y13, a moment please. What is it, George? That man Peterson has persuaded Central Department to let him come with us. - It's an order. - Aren't you exaggerating? There's not even a place. - Why not do without the radio operator? You'll see, we'd manage without. I'd prefer to do without you. Me? I really don't want my choice influenced by motives that aren't objective. Anyway, I could manage very well without a navigator. But a radio operator is indispensable. If it wasn't me who was the navigator... would you do without one then? - Perhaps not. - So, you're not being objective. Besides, it's I who don't want to leave you, George. I don't pretend to be more valuable than the Central Department. - But I'm not of less value either. - You mean you're giving me an order? No, only a request. I understand you, George. You always try to be worthy of your high position. But you'd be much better off if once, you tried... - What? To be worthy of yourself. Forgive me, George. - Is the nose up? - Certainly. The nose is always up. It's more stable. He's not referring to the ship Al, he's talking about me. My congratulations, Commander. Listen, Peterson, remember you're extraneous here, and to keep to your place. - What place? I don't even have a chair. - But how? There are two cots at your disposal, while none of us are resting. While you others are working, I'm supposed to sleep? - There are times when we put children to bed. Listen, ever since we left, you have all agreed to make me feel like an intruder. My congratulations, Peterson. - What's going on, Archie? - I don't know, Sir. - Maybe a magnetic storm. - Impossible. Listen to the wave boom, Sir. Look. Give me its position. Coordinates 1 - 1 - 3 Position of object in sky 5 - 1 - 2. Try to establish contact. It looks like a moon-ship. BZ88, BZ88, try to establish contact. - They're asking for help, Sir. - Change to voice circuit. MS13, MS13 to BZ88, over. BZ88 to MS13, we read you, over. Tanks have exploded, engines have failed. We're out of control and falling toward Mars, over. Try to get back into orbit around Mars. We'll try to rescue you. Tell us the cause of the explosion, over. Impossible to establish. A rush of hot air overpowered us. The instruments have gone haywire. The tanks have exploded. The structure's melted in several places, - The crew? - There are three of us, Sir. One dead... The engineer. Put on your space suits. Get ready to bail out when you reach orbit. That's all for now. Cut voice circuit. Do you think they'll make it? - That's what I'm checking now. Are you thinking the same as me, Al? - They can't make it. - Why not? No. We won't be able to make it. One of Mars' satellites is crossing our path. Try the engines again. It's suicide. Don't do it. I don't want to end like this, bottled up. What's happening? Can you make it? This is it. I'm climbing. One of my engines has restarted. We've done it. By weight's reducing. I'm manoeuvring. We've done it. We've done it. Light the engines and get ready for a vertical landing. We'll try to overfly Phobos. Engines at 6 gamma. Engines at 7 gamma. Engines at 8 gamma. Look there to the right. Perhaps... Engines at 11 gamma. Zero coordinates. We're assuming vertical position. Engines at 12 gamma. - What's happening? - We're going down, flea. But it's not possible. With all the tanks full of fuel. It's like a bomb. Landing area at two degrees from our coordinate below us. Engines at 14 gamma. Engines at 16 gamma. Engines at maximum. Cut the engines. Put on your suit, flea. You're coming to the rescue of that poor fellow. Orders of the Commander. Nine degrees inclination. A little more and we'd be stuck here forever. He's still alive. Hurry. Commander, we're coming back in. Lucy, get the gyroscope working. As soon as they're in, we're out of here. Carry him over there and hold on to him. I'll worry about the engines. Gyroscope on maximum. - How is he? - Bad. He should hold out till we get to Mars. We're almost there, right? What do you mean, no? We've changed course. We're heading to Venus. To Venus? It's an order from Central Department. And you accepted it? Don't you understand that man's dying? I don't have to answer to you for my actions, Peterson. Right, have you forgotten what the life of a man means? It means a world. He's everything that he sees, hears or desires. He, himself, is the world, the universe... You can't disregard him the way you're doing, Commander. Should I have disobeyed? You, disobey? Impossible. Your conscience would forbid it. That man has a name, Lewis. It'll seem incredible to you, but he has a wife on Earth. Her name is Lauren. She's not a number. She's a woman, who is waiting for him. But these are all useless words to you. You absolutely don't know what you are saying. You think I'm a simple sentimentalist But in reality, Commander, it's you who are arid and old-fashioned. You're like the typical soldier of the 20th century. Obtuse, detached. The same rhetoric, the same cruelty. I order you to be quiet, Peterson. You don't know how to do anything but order and obey. I can't disobey. Look, Commander. An area of incalculable heat. It seems like a photonic field equal to that of the sun itself. Turn on the safety systems. It's better to tell them everything. It's no longer Top Secret, Sir. You think so? Be very clear that I'm not speaking for you. What I'm going to say is not to justify myself. You might think I want to excuse myself, although it would be easy to humiliate those who are presumptuous and judgemental. Why don't you tell them the truth? I'd do it myself, but it's your duty. He's dead. He's spoken. Nothing is real. Space, the stars. Everything's dead, Lauren. An ice cold breath. Nothing's real, Lauren. Only your eyes exist. Your eyes... Living... Real... And your eyes are my sky. Lauren, my love. Look at me, Lauren. The moment has come when everyone must know the reality. a spaceship powered by photonic energy, no longer has a pilot. She's floating in space, guided only by an electronic brain. The photonic heat, which our radar has picked up is the heat of destruction, and of death. A2 has re-entered the solar system. On the next orbital turn, she will enter into orbit around the Earth, and will destroy everything, burning, eliminating for ever all signs of life. Is there no hope of stopping her? That's why we're going to Venus. It's the nearest point to the elliptical path of the spaceship. But we only have one chance in a million. I'll ask his forgiveness for you. You're crying. Look, the Earth. Yes, we're using the Earth's gravity to increase our speed. When the attraction gets too strong, we'll fire our engines and be off to Venus. Look at those dark spots. They're the continents. And the oceans, and the trees. - You can't see those. - I can imagine. I'd like to run down a long road lined with pine trees. On foot? Yes, feel once more the excitement of speed. But we're already travelling at 90,000 miles an hour, Ray. But we're standing still. That's nothing but a sensation. What day is today? The days don't count any more in space. Fine, but don't you know what date it is today? 359th of rotation around the sun. There, that's it. Christmas, Lucy. It's Christmas down there. Snow is falling, bells are ringing. The last Christmas if we don't do it. You know, if I were sure that avoiding the threat meant saving... What? Saving all that. Christmas, love. I would help you. - You? How? I heard a fable... that the prayer of a child can save the world. And you, would you be a child? If I really believed in all that, yes. In Christmas, in love? If we believed, really believed, we'd be children. Old Earth, with her fables, is getting further away and slowly disappearing. She can be as old as you like, but you can't ever accept that the last day is coming for her. Just like you can't ever think about the death of your mother. Goodbye, Earth. Spacecraft BZ88, attracted by the gravitational field of Venus, opposes the attractive force with its engines' thrust, to brake its descent onto the planet. At the Venus base, the astronauts will attempt to intercept and destroy A2 by means of powerful, remotely-guided missiles. - Hey, Archie, is that the base? - Yes, under the protective dome. There's too much hydrogen on Venus. - It's like the dome of a crystal temple. - You don't need a respirator inside. What are those plugs, purifying filters? The accelerated course works, you know everything. Tell me. Why, when Man wants to protect himself, does he hide under a dome? Put on your helmet and move, Ray. I offer you a tour of Venus. Shame it won't be a tourist trip. 8,500. 8,000 miles. 5,000 miles. All of them disintegrated. And always at 5,000 miles. We'll have a chance to hit her, only if the electric brain that controls her, goes out of control. You see... The two photonic generators, indicated here, that move at the extremes, with a constant gyroscopic motion, create around A2 an invisible sphere of incalculable heat, with a radius of 5,000 miles. We've just had the proof of it. It's indestructible. And so, one of man's dreams has come true. An indestructible destroyer. Unless we have a sudden change in the next solar system revolution A2 will enter orbit around the Earth at only 3,500 miles. Below the safety limit by 1,500 miles. In a few days, maybe a few hours, the Earth will become a mass of boiling mud. Like the time of its formation. We mustn't give up hope. Something might stop it. Perhaps a miracle. And whilst we're waiting here for your miracle... I suggest we put into operation all the means we have here at our disposal. They're now ready to fire missiles from the other hemisphere Why not order your men to reach the audio stations on the beach? You stand by electronic telescope number 7. You at number 3, Y13 at number 4. And me, what do I do? Rest? You're surplus to requirements. Even if you try to write a report, I doubt if you'll be able to send it to your admirers. It would be a completely pointless report. If you like, you can come with me. That boy believes in miracles. Another 25 degrees of rotation. Enough, Lucy. I can't listen to you talking like this any more. - There's nothing to do but wait. - Right, how long? One hour, two? We must wait 25 degrees. Don't be angry. One hour, two, has no meaning. Time is a relative category. It's only certain that we must wait. The return of A2, at least, unless they destroy it with the missiles from the other hemisphere. - Is there some hope? - I fear not. So, we've arrived at the end of everything. What do you mean? Of all this. The universe won't notice, even if the solar system disappears. This would happen to the complete indifference of the universe. Basically, forget it. - Why do you say forget the truth? - Truth? What have we found in space up to now? What? Nothing. Nothing but other worlds, solitary and deserted. This is what your marvellous science has given us. You've enormously increased our solitude. I'm not alone. The universe won't notice, but we will. I will, Ray. There's still a while, before that moment. Everything's still possible. But afterwards, the end. Even the end of love. Kiss me, Ray. It isn't important what is, it's only important how we feel. A kiss seems to last a moment. If we feel it's eternal, it is eternal. Right now you are all the women who have ever been, who could ever be. The stars have stopped. This insane chase has finished. The universe is hidden in your eyes. A2 has returned. There, I feel it passing. It wants to freeze love at any cost. We'll wait for it this way. Really, now I'd like... What, Lucy? I would like the end, the end of all this. 6,800. 5,700. 2,200. I don't understand why. With your permission, I'd like to offer an explanation. - What? - I believe I've understood it. Speak. I'm sure the ship, due to some technical construction error, is vulnerable. The two photonic deflectors at the extremities of A2, in their rotation, create... - A sphere of invulnerability. - But, no. Two distinct hemispheres separated by a narrow corridor. - Like an orange cut in half. - The perfect image, son. That's why a missile has gone through, according to you. It's the only one launched exactly in the middle of the corridor. But why did it disintegrate at 2,200 miles? Because of some imperceptible deviation. Or maybe just because it was attracted by one of the photonic fields. If your theory is right Al, there's still a way. - But what? Perform the launch on a straight line, from another spaceship, travelling alongside A2 at the same velocity. - I think I've the right to try. - Why the right? Because if my theory is correct, I'd like to be the one to receive the credit. And if it's wrong, you want to be the one to risk it. there's an old atomic spaceship here. I'll use the remotely guided missiles. May I, Sir? And I hope you'll manage to save humanity, assuming that it's really worth the trouble... Perhaps I measure humanity by my own yardstick. We'll follow you as closely as possible. All of us. As if we were right by you. All of us. Flea. Now you'll have a chance for a scoop... a universal exclusive. Let's hope it's a world one. Cut the engines. We're out of it now. You did well. Not everyone can stand 16 gamma. Considering the fact that I'm a flea... TS13 to BZ88, TS13 to BZ88, over. What Al called the old atomic spaceship has left the Venusian atmosphere, and is flying alongside BZ88. The spaceships shut off their motors. The inertial thrust that they have already acquired allows them to fly at fantastic speeds in the emptiness of space. Enough to reach A2, anyway. TS13, contact. - All correct, Commander? - All correct. How is the reporter? He's in good shape. My compliments, boy. Now you have something to tell your nephews. And tell them about your uncle Al. You can come and tell them yourself, granddad. You're already invited to my house. Requesting route check. Inertial velocity 30,000 miles. Coordinate fix 1 - 2 - 3 on Vega. Anticipated interception point with A2 coordinate fix 3 - 1 with respect to Earth at 18 degrees. Over. Exactly, with a mathematical approximation of three degrees' variation on A2 encounter. Good. I'll request another route check on the last approach phase. Let's hope we make it. Closing contact. Satellite ZX34, Satellite ZX34 calling BZ88, over. ZX34, received. - I'm Sullivan. - What's happening, Sullivan? The photonic field of spacecraft A2 has encountered the asteroid zone. Well then? A2 has changed her course by 6 degrees with respect to Vega. I'm afraid she'll enter orbit around the Earth earlier than expected. Can you ascertain her present position? Yes. High coordinates 27 degrees. Movement of ellipses gradually advancing. Look out. It's coming towards you. Yes, Sir. Shortly it'll be on top of us. The crew, Sullivan. They're all at their posts, Sir. Two mechanics went out on the space taxi to the solar mirror. I ordered them not to come back. See if you can save them. Sullivan, try to save yourself. It's too late, Sir. Answer me. Remember Sullivan in your scoop. Write this. He was not afraid, like always, because a man, even in space, changes his position, not his soul. He is what he is, wherever he is in the universe. What did he mean? What you're always saying, Peterson. That every man is his own world. Commander, I've just located the position of the space taxi. Tell me. Coordinates pi 28 - 8 degrees, in respect to the fixed star Aldebaran. Understood. We'll rescue the survivors. BZ88 calling space taxi B91. We're coming to rescue you. Be ready to bail out into space. BZ88 calling space taxi B91. We're coming to rescue you. Be ready to bail out. Out. - You can go and rest. - No Ray, show them in here. I wanted to see you. I'm pleased for you. Go and rest. How do you like that Jackson? I heard, and he even remembered our names. I didn't think he even knew them. Commander, I'm 7,000 miles from A2. In a few seconds I'll start launching. 5,000 miles. 3,000. This one's disintegrated too. I'll launch another. 5,000. 4,500. 800. We'll make it. 200. Launch another. I'm going closer, Commander. It's too dangerous, Al. Stop. You'll be attracted by the photonic fields. I've located the corridor. I'll try to break through it. I'm sure I can get at least 1,500 miles from the space ship, Sir. Turn back, it's madness. I'm only 2,000 miles away from A2 now. - Let me try. - Al, that's an order. but there are no orders any more, Commander. It's a useless sacrifice. No, son, I'm at 1,200 miles now. I don't want to disillusion you. But what would be the use of living, if the Earth were to be destroyed? We'd all be prisoners of space, with no hope of return. 800 miles. Al. I beg you. After 200 miles you've hardly any chance of keeping on course. That slight chance challenges me to try. Al, you don't know what you're doing. Maybe not, Commander, but in a few seconds, I'll really know everything. In this way, Al has proved the existence of the corridor, at the price of his life. But all is lost in any case. There's nothing for us to do, but follow his lead. But how, Lucy? Commander, why not request more ships with remotely guided missiles? It's too late. They'd never be able to reach us. - And then...? - I don't know. What's that object that keeps appearing on the screen? The space taxi, from the space station. The attraction must have put it in orbit around us. The space taxi. I rode on it once with Al. - What is it, Lucy, are you afraid? - For him. Yes, I understand you. I love him, George. I know. But all this has no meaning any more, George. Isn't that so? Perhaps it's the only thing that really does matter. Human feelings are much, much more unexplored and unknown than the whole of the universe put together. But at this point it's late. What have we been doing, in all these thousands of years? We've been congratulating ourselves in going forward faster and faster. When in reality, we've only been getting further away from ourselves. take my place. Excuse me. - Where are you going? - Out. - In the space taxi. - That's madness. Maybe, but not as much as what brought us to this point. You're not leaving here. Ray, Lucy loves you. And don't you know that Lucy's been all that matters to me in the world. It'll seem incredible to you, Peterson, but that's why I'll stop you at all costs from going to your death. But why, George? We're all going to our deaths anyway. I tell you, you won't go out, even if I have to use force. He's going to make it. He's detected the photonic field alongside the corridor. Look, it's insane. The corridor is getting narrow. Narrower all the time. - What's he throwing out? - Plugs, transistors. All the metallic parts he can find. George. I'll make it. I'm going to make it. Go on, Ray. You're nearly there. I've nothing else to throw out. Get rid of everything which isn't essential, Peterson, quickly. The path is clear. I'm there, I've done it. Ray, come on now. Move quickly. The hatch is above you, at the centre of the sphere. Ray, can you hear me? Answer, Ray. Yes, George. I hear you. Get into the pilot's seat. Disconnect the electronic brain. It must be on the panel at the left. Disconnect everything. The pilot is still inside the hibernation cell, dead. Disconnect all contacts on the left hand panel. George, they're already disconnected. The electronic brain, Ray. You must disconnect the electronic brain. It's in front of me. What should I do? Destroy it. Sever the cables. I can't. They won't come loose. He can cut them. There are emergency tools. They're under the pilot's footrest. Did you hear, Ray? Under the footrest. Alright. - Hurry. - He'd better hurry. We're entering the Earth's zone of attraction. Velocity is increasing. Use the wire cutters. Have you found them? Yes, I've found them. I'm about to cut the wires. George, I'm cutting the last cable. The deflector has stopped. Maybe we've made it. How can you tell the photonic field has been neutralised, George? We can find out in the only possible way. We're coming in, Ray. 7,000. 5,000. We're getting through. Ray, we're coming to you now. Finally the nightmare is over. Soon, Ray. We're coming closer. Prepare to be rescued. We're alongside, Ray. Get yourself out. The external hatch is jammed. It won't open, Lucy. It won't open any more. It won't open any more. Try again, Ray. Try, hurry. It can't open. He cut the cables. There's no more power on board. Earth Base 9 calling BZ88, respond, over. BZ88 to Earth Base 9, we read you. Are you all mad? If you continue to race that fast you'll end up disintegrating in the Earth's atmosphere. Separate and change course immediately. A2 is out of control. There's a man inside. We can't abandon him. We'll attempt a rescue. The space-suits. Take my place. We'll do it. George and the others are coming to free you. I can't hold out any more. - I can't control the oxygen. - The regulator, Ray. I don't have it any more. It was the last thing I threw out into space. You must hold on. BZ88. BZ88. Are you listening? - Received. We're listening. - Orders from Central Department. Desist action rescue of A2 pilot. Change course immediately or you'll soon enter the Earth's atmosphere. I repeat. Orders from Central Department... Down on Earth they don't know what they're talking about. They don't know what would have happened if Ray... Re-establish contact with him. We'll stay as close as possible to A2. Ray, we're very close now. George and the others are going out into space. Too much air. an orgy of air. My thoughts are running. Running wild. Lucy. Talk to me. Everything is spinning. Where are you Lucy? Here. Beside you. Quick. Open it here. What's the point... of trying to save the world, Lucy, if I lose myself? No. You can't say this. You always had more faith than the rest of us, Ray. You truly believed. - Ray, answer me. - I believed. But there's no faith... that can overcome... the fear of death. Ray, hang on. Goodbye, Lucy. Quick, inside. Lucy, we're inside. Get ready to turn the ship. Gyroscope to maximum. I'll tell you when to start the engines. Gyroscope to maximum. We're inside, Lucy. Get ready. Contact. We've made it, Lucy. Keep the engines at maximum. Now you're really worthy of yourself, George. The Earth, the oceans, and continents. Now I can see the trees too. I seem to smell a sweet smell, like wet earth after the first rain. The wind will caress our faces, as we run together, Ray, holding hands. One thought makes me happy. That we still have all this.
