Start up approved. Vulkan, I'm Vyuga. Request taxi. Vyuga, I'm Vulkan. Cleared to taxi. I know it's him. You know him? You lucky, Liusya. I wish I were as tall and beautiful as you. Don't worry, Sasha. You'll grow up yet. Yeah, but I'm not pretty. You foolish girl. Liusya, did he kiss you? You've gotten completely out of hand! I'm going to tell Dad about it. And about your bad mark in physics, too. - And I'll tell him about Mitya. - Let's go. Come tonight! Gogol Street, 12, Apt. 3. Liusya. It's him! The fir tree thrives and grows, And laughs at winter snows! Mitya asked me to tell you that he won't come. He's got a gumboil. - Good evening! - Good evening! - Who do you want to see? - You. I don't think we've met. I'm afraid you got a wrong apartment. Number 12, apartment 3. Aren't you Liusya? All right, come in. - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! You can take me for Santa Claus, though I don't have a beard. But I have... This! - Right from the blue sea. - And speaking seriously? Seriously? I read your address on the glass and decided to drop by. Do you mind? - Sorry to have bothered you. - It's all right. Where are you going? She was just kidding. Weren't you, Liusya? Sasha, don't butt in. Anyway, it's time for you to go to bed. Can't do anything about it. You should do as the grownups say. - Why did you do that? - Well, enough of that. Do you know who was it? - It was Astakhov! - Who? The famous pilot! I saw his picture in a magazine. - You'd better think of your studies. - It's a holiday! We must bring him back! The best thing you can do now is to say good night to everybody. Liusya, why are you doing that? Are you still here? Good night. Sasha, where are you going? Good night. - Shall we drive on? - No, let's wait here. Sashenka! Give it to Liusya. I'll come to see her tomorrow. - Who was that? - Mitya, Liusya's fiance. They're going to get married after this session. Dad doesn't object. I'm sorry. - He's weird. - You yourself are weird. He's a serious guy. Stop talking, please! Cram it! Or you'll flunk. "But if my hapless situation Evokes some pity for my woe, You won't abandon me, I know." "But no! Each moment of my days To see you and pursue you madly! To catch your smile & search your gaze With loving eyes that seek you gladly, To hear your voice..." But I'm now another's wife, And I'll be faithful all my life! What happened? - Please, tell me what happened? - It's war! Goodbye. A mug, a spoon, and provisions for three days. - Let them say goodbye in private. - No, no, we'll go to the kitchen. Sasha! Petya calls you. Have you got a mug and a spoon? And provisions for three days? Now you'll go to battle with a light heart. And when you come back, I will meet you and will become yours forever. All right. BREAD SHOP Your hair is just like mama's. You have grown up already. Dad, will you write to me? It's all right, Sashenka. Hello? Liusya Lvova? She's not in town. She's been evacuated. From the hospital? Mitya Kovshov? How is he? - Whom do you want to see? - Kovshov. Over there, on the right. With a bandaged head. - Whom do you want? - Kovshov. This way, please. Hello, Mitya. Sashenka! Liusya's been evacuated. - I've already been told. - What's wrong with you? Ah, it's nothing. How is Liusya? What does she write? Everything is all right. She's there with Seryozha. Poor girl. This night they're sending me to the rear. Do you mind taking something from under my pillow? Of course not. There's a notebook in the bag. It's all right! It's all right! - Do you know anything about physics? - Not much. I've always had only C in physics. Put it right on the bed. You see, it's some of my ideas about the nature of protons. I think I've found something. But all this needs checking. Promise me you'll save it. Crazy girl! Let me go! AIR-RAID SHELTER Please, let me go! My father is leaving! You only torture yourself for nothing. We won't get out of here before morning. You better go down and have some rest. Go, you can't stand here. It's not allowed, understand? - You got a light? - No. - You got a light? - No. - You need a light? - Yes. - Astakhov? - You're Yezhov! Kolia! To meet like that! - Where're you now? - In the Urals. - I'm a test pilot there. - Congratulations! - And what are you doing here? - Hiding from the bombing. Me too. So will you give me a light? Listen, I have a proposition for you. Come to work at our plant. All clear! - How about that? - Why? I'm a flyer. Our general will recall you, he needs you very much. - No, I can't. - What are you talking about? You're a first-class test pilot! No, I can't fly so far from the front. - There's as much risk there. - I know. But I want to fight. And I got used to my comrades. - That's only emotions. - Not for me. - What's wrong with your plane? - It's being repaired. It got like a sieve on the last mission. - Well, take care. - Bye! - You better think about it. - No, it's not for me. Good luck! Where can I find you? Call 33-34. 33-34? All right. "Sasha! I got to go. Too bad I missed you. Cheer up and be a good girl. Write to Liusya. Love, your dad." Now you try. Put your hand right here. Officer on duty speaking. - Can I speak to Astakhov? - Who's calling? - Sasha Lvova, on business. - He's in the air. - Where? - In the air. What do you want? - Ask him to call me back. - Let me put down your number. - 74-12. - Got it. What? - Hello? - It's Astakhov. - You wanted me to call you. - Yes. Who are you? My name is Sasha Lvova. We were together in the air-shelter. I don't remember you. I wanted to come up to you, but you were talking to your friend. What's the problem? What do you want? - To meet you. - To meet me? What for? - No special reason. - What do you look like? Me? - I don't know. - Tell me anyway. - I'd better hang up. - No. Let's meet. - By the air-shelter. - Tomorrow at 16:00. Are you waiting for me? - No, not for you. - Too bad. Well, I'm sorry. Hello, it's me. What grade are you in at school? I've already finished school! Well, let's get acquainted then. I'm Alexei. I know. - And I am... - Sasha Lvova. I know it, too. And what are we going to do? Let's go to the movies. It's too crowded there. - I know one place. - Is it far? - Shall we hit it? - Let's hit it. Aren't you glad we hit it here? It's romantic, but pretty cold. Want to go in the cabin? Come on, don't be afraid, I've been here before. Don't! Don't dare kissing me! When there's no love, it's vulgar! Vulgar? Then why did you drag me here? I didn't drag you! Why did you call me and fix a date? - I don't know. - You don't know? You should know. Or you could have asked your mother. I got no mother. I got nobody. Except you. You have known me only two days. I thought we'd known each other a long time. Since I was in the 8th grade. I got to go. Sashenka... Let's meet again tomorrow. My plane will be in repairs until the 25th. So we've got four days. Or you don't want to? You might think very badly of me, but let's meet all four days. Astakhov! Peace! Peace! Peace! Peace! - Are you cold? - No. - And your hands? I can see. - They're used to cold. - Give me your hands! - No. Did you ever bring down any enemy planes? I did. Right when you were calling me the first time. So you fly to the front line? Sometimes even farther. When are you going to fly again? As soon as we heal our wounds, we'll fly again. What wounds? That night my plane hardly made it to the airfield. Now we have to make the plane well. Then we'll fly again. Aren't you afraid that you may be killed? I could invite you to my place, but it's very cold there. It hasn't been heated for three days. I have always imagined you just like that. Like what? Like that... Tell me, are they stronger than we? They are. Then how can you hold them back? Because... Because Russia is behind us, our people. They believe in us. And when someone believes in you, you become stronger. I've always thought you're like that. Like what? Like that... Don't leave! Don't leave. - I've got to fly in the morning. - What? Already? I'll call you when I get back. I'll be waiting for you! You know what? Just forget him! Why are you pining over him? He doesn't call you? Good riddance! Let's go dancing tonight. So what? War is war, but you only live once. He has gone, and I forgot him, Years passed, I realized... But what if he calls? How happy I was with him... Yes? - Are you Sasha Lvova? - Yes. I'm calling you at Alexei Astakhov's request. - What happened? - Everything is all right. - He'll call you in the evening. - What's wrong with him? Everything's fine. Listen to the news broadcast. ...About 80 vehicles with ammunition. Fighter pilot Lieutenant Astakhov, after using up all his ammunition, went to ram a German bomber "Junkers-88" and brought it down. The Soviet pilot has survived. Pilots of Comrade Trofimov's squadron from the South-Western Front, accomplishing a night flight... - Well, everything's all right? - All right! Sashenka, come on, everything's all right. I'm crying from joy! Oh, you're so dirty! - Were you burning? - A little bit. - You have to wash up! - No, I got to go back to my unit. No! Today you are not going anywhere! - Today you're only mine! - I'm on duty. It's war! No! I'm not giving you to anybody! Today you're mine! Only mine! You could have been killed! Now you'll rest, and in the morning you'll go to your unit from home. What did you say? Yes. It will be our home. That's my girl! Do you love me? - Then you'll stay. - I can't. Call your unit! Think of something! - Come on, lie to them! - No, I can't. Sometimes one can do it. Is it thirteenth? Astakhov reporting. No, I'm in town. I ask your permission to stay home until morning. No, not my relatives. My wife. Sashenka. Thank you, I'll tell her. Yes, sir. So he didn't call you again? Right. Well, no crying will help you now. We girls have only ourselves to blame. Was there anything between you two? Just as I thought! What a stupid girl you are! No, I'm not. There's a pilot out there asking for you. Sashenka? On the night of December 7, pilot Astakhov of N air squadron has heroically died in a fight with outnumbering enemy planes. The Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet decrees: For the selfless courage and fortitude shown in fighting for the freedom and independence of our Motherland, to award Lieutenant Alexei Astakhov the Order of Red Banner posthumously. "Today at 5:30 a.m. will be passing through Tovarnaya Station. A stop possible. Meet me. Dad." Dad! Why are you standing there? Come and get your hero. He is not mine. - I didn't have a blanket like that. - A pilot brought the blanket. A pilot? What pilot? Just a pilot. He's waiting downstairs. Congratulations. Sashenka... Thank you. Thank you, Petya. For everything! - Is he sleeping? - He is. - It'll be hard for you raising him. - You call it hard? Hard is when you lose a man. You've changed a lot since those times. No, I'm the same. And you're the same, too. It's only that we have grown a thousand years older. It's all right, Sashenka. Here, take this money. Take it away now. I'm not taking it. - Sasha! - No, I can't. We're friends, aren't we? Take it. Thanks. Sashenka. I got to fly. But if you... Well, you must know that I'm still the same. On May 8, 1945, in Berlin, the representatives of the German Command signed an Act on the unconditional capitulation of all German armed forces. Mommy, what is it? The war is over. And what happens when the war is over? Peace comes. And all the soldiers... ...come back home. Seryozha? Seryozha! - Put them down here. - Stop ordering about! - Where're the suitcases? - Downstairs. Where? - And where's Yegorka? - In the kindergarten. - Liusya! - Oh, God! - How could you? - Why? He loves me. Besides, he saved Seryozha's and my lives. If it were not for him... - Yes, but he is... - What? Old? No, for a man, he's not old. - And what about Mitya? - What about Mitya? I live on the earth, not in the clouds. I had Seryozha on my hands, I had to feed him. Here, Liusya. My aquarium! - Where's our nephew? - In the kindergarten. I'll breed fishes for him! Sashenka. Let's dot the i's and cross the t's. I'm the elder sister, so I'm taking this room. - Do you mind? - No, not at all. And you with Yegorka will live there. - And where shall I live? - You? - Yes. - I've got an idea! We'll nail this door up and put a partition here. We'll be entering by the back door, and you will live here. Here we are. I didn't stop thinking about you. Please don't start, Petya. Well, Yegorka, I'm glad to meet you. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! No! - Sasha, but he's dead! - No! - This moment will be lost forever. - Don't dare! All right, I'll wait. Can't you understand that the child needs a father? Thank you. Don't be angry with me. No! I'm sorry. Where're you going, Petya? You fool! What a fool you are! You think you can find a better husband? - Don't meddle. - But he loves you! Don't meddle! You'll never be happy if you go on like this. I was happy! Very happy! You can't even imagine how happy! Sasha! My foolish girl! I love you. Sasha Lvova found her happiness at the plant. Who is there? The door is nailed up. Come in through the courtyard. Sasha! Sasha! Sashenka! Alyosha! - Alyosha! - Come, come, Sashenka! Don't leave! Don't leave! Don't leave, please! Stay where you are. I'll come myself. I'll be right there! I'm coming! I'll be right there! - Is Alyosha home? - No, he hasn't come yet. - Something happened? - No, nothing. - Do you want some tea? - No, thank you. He's probably at his favourite hangout, in a pub. Don't say such things! Excuse me. I didn't think it was news for you. - Please, don't fight. - No one's fighting. - Shall I pour you some tea? - No, thanks. Wait a second. Since we started it, let's sort things out. I've been meaning to talk about it for quite a while. About what? - About Astakhov. - What business is that of yours? Why are you so rude? Liusya and I only wish you well. Well? All right. I'll be honest. Astakhov's living in our house reflects badly on you in the first place. - Astakhov is my husband. - He's no husband to you. You haven't even been registered. - It's none of your business. - Perhaps. What can he give you, that character who sunk so low, that... Stop it, Nikolai! - No, let him go on. - And not only that. This man might have had a questionable past. About which we couldn't even guess. Have you ever thought about it? - No, I haven't. - But you should have. All this could have most dire consequences. I'm already having some problems at my work. - Such as? - Never mind! Never mind! I understand that because of the war anyone could have... You could have nothing! You've spent all the time in Alma-Ata! I was there because of my poor health! - You snotty girl! - Quiet. I worked like a horse there! You've brought that character to our house, and now we have to bear it. Nobody is forcing you! You can get out of here! What? What do you mean, get out of here? It's my home! The apartment is registered in my name! It's my father's apartment! And if our father were alive... Nikolai, go away! Sasha, what's the matter with you? Calm yourself. Nikolai only wishes you well. What can we do about this situation? Leave him, and you'll feel much better. Why are you meddling in my life? Who asked you? He's my husband, the way he is! - Good evening, Alexei. - Good evening. - What's going on here? - I was worried about you. You know that I'm working. Scoundrel! Two hours ago I saw him in front of a pub. She waited for him so long! Dear Sashenka, I've never written to you, but today I decided to write you a letter. For over a year, I've been living north of the Arctic Circle. I make Arctic reconnaissance flights and accompany ships. Our schoolmates write to me, so I know everything about you. I know that Astakhov has come back. I'm happy for you. I can imagine how happy you are. You've never loved me. But I did love you. And thanks to you I did a lot of good things in life. Goodbye, Sashenka. Goodbye, my love. Yours, Petya. Congratulations! What have we come to! Your husband is hanging around the pub in a most bestial condition. It's simply outrageous! Ah, Sasha. Why did you come? Don't you see I'm drunk? Go home. Go! Why are you staring? You don't recognize me? A lot of people don't. But I can refresh your memory. Alexei Astakhov, a former pilot, but now... Come on, Sasha, let's have a drink. It's on your money anyway. And you thought I was flying? Yeah, I'm flying! I refuel around the corner and dive down with my mug in the dirt! Sashenka. Please don't cry, Sashenka. My little girl, I know you love me. You waited for me. Waited for so long. And that's what you got. But how could I tell you about it? About what? About what? Just today I went to see one man. We served together. Here I am! I want to fly! I can't do anything else! But you were a prisoner of war! Yes. I was a prisoner, I'm guilty. Guilty of of being shot down. Guilty of being taken prisoner while almost dead. Guilty of running away and being caught, with the dogs tearing my flesh! Guilty of not dying of hunger, of not being shot or burned in a furnace! Guilty! I'm sorry! No! Don't believe them, son. Our dad is a good, kind and clever man! He fought in the war, he's a hero! It's just that he was hurt so terribly. Don't cry, mom. You'll see, everything will be all right. Will dad fly in a plane again? He will! Hey, flyer! Time for landing, your wife's here! His wife can wait, he's in training. I'll be right there. - How was it? - Great! - Did they admit you? - They sure did! - "Wasn't imprisoned or prosecuted"... - Congratulations! - Thanks. You joining too? - No. He's being reinstated in the party. That's even easier. Good luck! Astakhov, come in! The situation is like this. We discussed it with comrades here and decided we shouldn't, you see, we shouldn't! In short, we decided to abstain! - I see. - It's good you understand. - Can I go now? - Yes. Comrades, we have to be at Shop 10 at eight. - Lvova, you can go, too. - But why? We all understand how you feel, but you're his wife, by the way. - I'm a Party member, too. - But your arguments are not serious. You wrote that you vouched for him, but how do you know what he was doing in prison? - He told me. - My dear... A Party member must be responsible for his or her statements. - He surrendered to the enemy. - He was unconscious. How can you prove it? All Communist prisoners were shot. - Why wasn't he? - To whom are you saying it? He's right. They were shot. Wait, we must make her understand. As he says himself, he worked at a military airfield. - He wanted to run away! - Why didn't he? - You know why. - I don't know and you don't know. You don't know a lot of things, which are not for you to know. Is it clear? Think about it. Alyosha! I shouldn't have come back to you. - I've made you unhappy. - No, I'm happy. And Yegorka too, the way he looks at me... He loves you, and he's proud of you. Let's not lie to ourselves. We all have a very bad time. It's all right, we'll fight for you. Fight with whom? In the war we had the enemy, and whom do we have here? But you're right! - You're right! - And all the others are wrong? - It can't be so. - What is your guilt? I surrendered to the enemy. - You were unconscious. - That's what I say. There was a moment when I could shoot myself. I could! I lost consciousness later, when I was crawling. - It would have solved all problems. - Don't say so! We were waiting for you. - I've ruined your lives. - No, it's not your fault! Whose is it then? Whose fault is it? I don't know. But you're not guilty! You were fighting, you wanted to escape! There's no proof of that! There were other people there, they can confirm it. How can I find them now? They were in prison, too. It's not so simple as you think. There were traitors and provocateurs among them! I know! No. You can't blame anyone. Everything is right and we can't blame anyone. - If you hew trees the chips must fly! - It's wrong! Someone cruel has thought it up! The great struggle is going on! And it doesn't count if one, or two, or ten innocent people suffer! For the sake of that great aim, we must not pity anyone, even ourselves. I'm fed up with those high-flown words. I'm worried about the way you live. You like only dancing, nothing else. I'm not very keen on dancing either. But at least no one's moralizing there. Wait! Well, I'm waiting. - Are you going to hit me now? - Stop clowning. - At your age, I... - I didn't storm the Winter Palace. - No, I didn't. So what? - You live like a parasite. No, I'm working, just like you. And I fulfil my norm. But what do you live for? What is dear to you? What are you striving for? What do you hate? - Have you ever thought about it? - Yes, I have! But where is it, thatjustice of yours? Avdeyich lectures me about the war and heroism, but he himself is a coward! Liusya insists that he had saved my life! And my father died in action! It was him who had saved my life, and Avdeyich's life too. Or take you. You fought against the Germans, you were in a camp. As a kid, I was proud of you, I dreamed of being like you! And now we even get the same wages. - Where's justice? - It's a base thing to say! What's base is to keep silent! Listen to what I'll tell you. What I had gone through would be enough for a hundred of men like you. It's not easy for me now either. But if I had to start all over again, I would have lived exactly the same life. To you, Communism is just a high-flown word, but to me it's my life. I know that you're a true Communist. - Then why are you not in the Party? - It needs to be so. - Who needs it? - Sergey, stop it! No, answer me! Who needs it? She? Me? Yegorka? The country you fought for? Shut up! You seekers of the truth! Alyosha, he's just a boy. A silly boy. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Besides... - He's right about many things. - Right! He's more honest than we are. What's going on? Why are we lying to ourselves? What are we afraid of admitting? Have we ever doubted the Party? Or the righteousness of our cause and our ideals? - What is it? - It's some nightmare! If you hew trees the chips must fly. Who said that a human life didn't count? That vigilance means universal suspiciousness? Was it the Party? I know what I'm going to do! This morning I'm going to Moscow. It may take me a month, two, six months, but I'll make them review my case. I'll tell them what I had gone through, what I have felt and thought. I'll tell them: if you need my life, I'm ready to give it to the people. But I'm a soldier, not a victim. I'm a human being, damn it, and I want the truth! Sasha! Stalin is dead. You didn't expect me? - It even took my breath away! - Mine, too. - Let's shake hands. - My hands are wet. And mine are dirty, something's wrong with the carburetor. - Are you a motorist? - No. You lucky girl. - Can I wash my hands? - Of course. - There was a bench here, right? - Yes, but it has been burnt. I see. All the rest looks the same. Things don't change, only we change. You have changed for the better. Really? - How are you doing here? - We get by. - That sounds too vague. - And how are you? I'm working. - Where? - In an institute. I forgot its name. It's about physics. - I'm being incredibly lucky. - In love? I'd say, generally. - What are we doing in the kitchen? - I came just for a minute. Remember I gave you a notebook in the hospital? - Have you lost it? - No. - And you can show it to me? - Of course. - Then bring it here now! - All right. Sasha, do you know where our brush is? Here. Oh, what a stroke of luck! You can't even imagine how lucky I am! I remembered about it only recently. Here! Here is what I needed. Oh, it's so fortunate. Now I owe it to you. - Ask for whatever you like! - Gladly. Give back my towel, you're sitting on it. Oh, I'm sorry! How can I reward you? Look, unfortunately, it's the London edition, it'll be hard to read. But you wouldn't read it even in Russian. What's important is the act. And here it is. It's my book. - Please. - Thank you. Sashenka, do you know... - Hello. - Hello. I dropped by just for a minute, on business. I got to go. It's a long way. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Thank you again. - Goodbye. - What did he come for? - For his notebook. - And what is this? - His book, in English. Where could that brush be? Liusya, my dear! Liusya! - Something wrong? - No, go to sleep. Tell me what happened? I can see it. Nothing special. They want to see me again. Why? I don't know. Everything I could tell them, I said six months ago. Are they going to start it all over again? No, of course not. The times are different now. Perhaps it's a good sign. You're an incorrigible optimist, Sasha. I'll wait for you. Alyosha! What happened? Clear the runways. 73, get ready to receive a plane. Thank you. - To the airfield? - No, to the city, please. I want to go home. - Did I keep you too long? - No, only ten minutes. THE END
