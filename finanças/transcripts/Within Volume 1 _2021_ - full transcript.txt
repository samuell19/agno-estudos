WITH/IN VOLUME 1 STOP. REALLY. STOP. LEAVE ALL DELIVERIES HERE! Lucy? Hi. How are you? Hi, Dr. Gordon. This is so weird. You're there, I'm here. How do we do this? How do we start? Just like we always do when you were in my office, except you hid the camera on the bottom left of your screen. Do you have to see me? Well, since we haven't talked in a while, I think it's important that. I have some visual contact with you. We can go to normal phone sessions in the future. Patients have been worried about their hair looking different. No, it's not that. I look great. I'm so rested. YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN DELIVERED BY ROBERT. ENJOY! -I'm glad you're sleeping. -Thank you. So uh, let's turn the camera on. Fortunately, it has also given me some anxiety, like with this call, like what if your house is ugly, that would be very triggering for me. -You've seen my office. -I have. And I have been wanting to talk to you about that. I feel like the color of the walls and the couch are fighting each other. Why don't we take a breath, close your eyes, picture an endless body of water, put your mouse on the video prompt, and click when you're ready? -How are you? -No, how are you? -With COVID? I'm fine. -No, with being black. Sorry, with being African American with the Black Lives Matter. Well, it's a painful time. But it's always been painful. I mean, these murders aren't new. But the public concern is. Our pain is becoming a shared pain. There's a sense of relief, you know, in that and a sense of hope, that maybe there will be some real and lasting change. I take responsibility and I am so sorry that racism even exists. -Can I say that? -Yes. Of course. It's disgusting. And I feel guilty. I really do. And what else? What can I do? Well, you could commit to learning about the true history of racism. -That's a start. -I did. Yeah. I've done that. I've been reading James Baldwin and I've watched that... the documentary on, I don't... Frederick Douglass. So good. That's a great beginning. Frederick Douglass is... Shall we start now? Sure. Yes, yes, of course, of course. So, how are you? Well, I have found this pandemic very validating, which has been incredible for my self-esteem. Tell me about that. This is my time. -Can you elaborate? -I'm right, finally. Well, I have always been right. The world is full of dangerous germs and if we get near them, we die. And that is so liberating. There's a lot to unpack in what you just said. So what I'm hearing is, in a way the world is walking in your shoes now? Yes, yes. Exactly. I have been washing my hands 30 times a day and socially distancing my entire life. Friends are calling me for advice. It sounds as if there is a feeling of relief as well as a sense of belonging to your own life. -That's very powerful, Lucy. -I feel like I could start dating. I am always avoiding touching people, even people I want to touch. And now, that is socially acceptable. So the reality of COVID, along with your OCD, has helped you manage your response to it. Is that a dog? Have you got a dog? I really don't like dogs. -Dr. Gordon, have you got a dog? -No... -They lick their butt and lick your face. -No... -And they've got worms... -No. -And parvo. -I don't have any pets, but... And they get ear infections. For the record, humans can't catch any diseases from a dog. Can't you get COVID from a dog? There have been no confirmed cases of pets carrying COVID according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Right. No confirmed cases. What about the cases that haven't been confirmed? -It's on their website. -This is my worst fear. Experts giving me advice that I can't trust. Let's talk about that. Tell me about that. The only voice I can trust is the one inside me. And the first time ever, it's not broken. Let's stay with that for a moment. This feeling that the world has finally caught up to who you are, and it's helping you find your place. Yeah. Please can you make it stop? I can't even hear my voice and you can make it stop. I can't make it stop, but what if we do some deep breathing together? We think of the barking as a calming sound. Let's just change our emotional frame of reference to it, okay? And breathe in. One. Breathe in... and out. Good job, Lucy. Good job. "Dear Chinese chicken salad dressing on the side, chicken on the side, lettuce on the side. I've delivered food to your house several times and noticed you have an enclosed yard and always added tip on the app even when I was late or messed up your order. Thank you for that." "I can no longer afford to stay in LA under these circumstances. So I'm going back to where I came from to live in an apartment with my parents." "But it doesn't allow pets. So I'm taking a leap of faith, putting my trust in the right person who will do the right thing for my Nala. She's a sweet girl, soulful, and so smart. Please be the person I believe you to be. Please be the person I need you to be." Me? Oh no! This is... this is not... No. Why? Why me? Why me? This is really pushing all my buttons. This is too much. I am in control of my thoughts. I am in control of my emotions. I am in control of my thoughts. I am in control of my emotions. I am in control of my thoughts. Stop. Wait, wait, wait. Stay right there. Hi, Nala. I'm Beth. Do you bite? 'Cause that would be a deal breaker. He said you were sweet. I've always wanted a dog, but I've never allowed myself to have one, although everyone I've ever known has highly recommended my making this kind of commitment. I have work. I have patients that really need me right now. Could you please keep it down for a moment? That's my next patient and he can be kind of demanding. We don't know when it's gonna go back. My job is to help you feel safe with the uncertainty of that. No, it's my neighbor's dog. Nala. Of course, you have my full attention. Yes, Donald. Yeah, you're going into... you're going into panic. Let's get you back in focus, okay? And let's use your senses. Okay, all right. Tell me one thing you can touch. Your phone. Right, okay. Yes. And one thing you can smell. Oh, okay. And one thing you can taste. Do you have some water there? Okay, take a sip. Good, Donald. All right. Okay. Now breathe in. Hi, Nala. That was one. That was two. That was three. I can't do this. I understand. Karen, yes. FaceTime her, 15 to 20 times in a row. Short calls. The more you're exposed to the fact that she's healthy and wants to engage, it will help open new neural pathways for the both of you. I don't have room for this in my life. Yes, I live alone. I work from home. But I can't split my focus. I don't have time. Hawthorne Shelter's reopened. Wait, it says here Hawthorne is a high kill shelter. How many pounds is she? She's not gonna fit in a purse, if that's what you mean. She resembles a pit bull with short legs. Big dogs get put down first? Why? That's just wrong. What if I donate money for her to stay until she's adopted? Who is they? It's ultimately up to me. Why does everyone think I have the answer? Why is it always up to me to figure out what's right? Hello? Hi, Nala. Can you sit? Not bad. Can you fetch? Good job. Oh, good job. It's not your germs that worry me, because people with animals tend to have stronger immune systems for a host of reasons. Happiness Quotient. Exercise level. Being exposed to more germs helps the body more easily fight them off. I know what it's like to be pre-judged for what you look like, to provoke a response when you're doing nothing, because people live in fear. They have these prejudices they don't even understand. The hardest part for my clients with OCD is once they master the fear of one thing, their fear often transfers to something else. I feel their pain, because it ties into my own OCD and panic issues. But of course, I can't tell them that. I can't tell them anything that personal, you know? So COVID has been easy for me. It's been a relief not to go out. My whole life has been about keeping a safe distance from people, because I've been easily misunderstood, you know? Because to be really honest, Nala, I'm afraid if they knew all of me... ...they might not love me. I think we're making progress. WEEK ONE What the fuck is she FaceTiming me for? Shit. Fucking chicken. Okay. All right. -Hey. -Hey. You did your hair? Why? -Where the fuck you going? -Oh, shut up. And why the hell you wearing a hat in the house? I was on a call. I told you. Anyway, what's up? I'm trying to find the strength not to kill my husband. But it's... you go, what's up with you? How are you? I'm all right. You know, just trying to stay busy. Been writing, exercising. Have you been exercising? Really? Gigi, come on. I'm sorry. I know you don't exercise. So I thought I would ask. Maybe you're trying to take advantage of the situation and be healthy. -Oh, shut up. -You shut up. Oh, what the... shit. The numbers just went up again. I know. I saw the news this morning. It's horrible. God, I'm telling you, this shit is scaring the shit out of me. The end is coming and my husband, he's over there watching that stupid news channel and he's still convinced that it's a hoax. -Every day he's in my ear, talking shit. -Well, it's not a hoax. I know that, okay? Please don't stress me out. Coco, I'm telling you right now, God's wrath is coming down upon us, okay? Just like the Bible says, there will be fires, there will be floods... And more destruction and the world's going to end. Gigi, they've been preaching the same shit during every world crisis since the Spanish Flu to Y2K and now this. You want to let me finish a sentence? Because you're really annoying. I'm not try... Okay, you know what, I'm sorry. I've been cooped up in this house alone for a week and a half, with no one to talk to, so cut me some slack. Well, I thought you said you were just on the phone with someone? -Well, you know what I mean. -Well, I called you. I called you yesterday. I called you the day before yesterday. And you didn't call me back. And please don't tell me it's because you were busy, 'cause I know your ass wasn't. -I was. -Yeah, what? Doing what? Coloring in those grays? I just did mine this morning. -Did you get Botox? -No. Who the hell is looking at your big-ass forehead right now? For your husband who's not even there? Me, and maybe a couple of other girls? You know, the world is coming to an end. And you're worried about your forehead. And you need to get yourself some Botox too, whenever this shit is over. And you need to take care of that moustache that's growing. It's hideous. You know, it's 11:00 in the morning? And? I bet you a lot of other people are pouring right now, too. This shit is too crazy not to get drunk before noon. -You really need to start praying. -I pray every day. As I thank the Lord for these fermented grapes. Gigi, relax. Jesus drank wine, too, during a time of crisis. So it's okay. -What? -The Last Supper? How the hell do you think he got up on that cross? Coco, blasphemy. That's at least a week in hell. And he should have smoked a fatty, too. Speaking of... Look at that. Yup. -Seriously, Coco? -It's just weed. -God's own green grass. -At least a month and half. A month. Oh shit. He's back now. And I didn't even get to tell you why I called you. Girl, all of a sudden, he wants to start fucking again. -No jodas. You poor thing. -I know. But you know what? At least, it only lasts five or ten minutes tops. Don't say anything. You're so lucky that you still like having sex with John. I know, it's hard not having him there with you. But, girl, at least he's not driving you crazy like every other woman's husband is doing right now. I got to go. He's here. I got to go. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Okay, bye. WEEK THREE Shit! Oh my God! You look like a hot mess and I'm a fat fucking pig. Coco, I really... Shut the fuck up. I didn't call for this. What's wrong? Oh God! Just I started drinking again. Why? Because that's all we do is fight. That's all that happens, is what we do is fight. So what else is new? I'm having a fucking nervous breakdown right now. And I could do without your sarcasm. I'm sorry, I'm drunk. You okay? -No. I hit him. -Who? Julio? No jodas. I told him. I couldn't take it anymore. And if he continued to watch that Tucker Carlson and if he didn't change the channel, I was gonna beat the shit out of him. And he laughed, so I hit him. And there was blood everywhere. And I mean, thank God that the swelling went down. -Oh my God! -Oh my God, I know... I'm gonna call you tomorrow, because I can't even take it today. Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gigi. I'm drunk, too. I'm sorry. Don't hang up. So what you get drunk on, Henny? No, you ass. It wasn't Henny, it was gin. And I'm going to hell. No, you're not. Because there is no hell. Okay. You die, and that's it. Jail, maybe. Especially with your temper. You really shouldn't be drinking... I don't want to hear you go into a tizzy about this, about me drinking, please. I had to drink, because if not I'm gonna kill this guy, I'm gonna kill this man. I love him. I love my husband. But I do not like him. And I don't like him right now. And you are lucky that you love and you like John. Right? Yes. Yes, yes, I love and like John. It's just this distance is getting to me. I called him this morning, and he said... It doesn't even matter. He doesn't even seem bothered, and I'm like fucking losing it. Trust me. Trust me. John is going through it, too. Don't worry. This is gonna pass eventually. I thought you said the world was ending. Yeah, I said a lot of things. The question is, do I really believe it? Or maybe it's the gin talking. I don't know. Either way, I'm tired and I'm gonna pass out. -I'm gonna go to sleep, okay? Bye. -No, no, no. Wait. WEEK FIVE Hey. Julio's downstairs in the living room. And he doesn't know about my little friend here. Oh my God. It's getting bad. And you know what? I've got my little friend right here, too. Oh my goodness. You saw the news today? Yeah. John called. He said he thinks he should stay away for another week, so... You know how I've always been jealous of the love that you and John have for each other? -Why? -Because I was and am stupid. You remember the time that we were all sitting around your house in Connecticut, and we were going around, everybody had to say what they would miss if they never had it again? And your John said, "I can't imagine my life without this woman. The thought of losing her scares the shit out of me, because I love her so much." And then I said, "You guys are pathetic cornballs." Remember? Yes, I know I remember. 'Cause Julio followed that up with, he misses playing Call of Duty. Oh no, honey. That was supposed to make you laugh, not cry. No, I'm sorry. It's just... I keep getting these panic attacks, you know? Like, I'm here all by myself, like what if I die by myself? You know, and then it's like, what if you're right? -What if this is the end? -Have another drink with me. You don't have another drink... light one of your joints. Oh God! What the hell is happening to you? I don't know. It's all right. You know, I really should stop. I mean, not the weed, but you know, it's the liquor. This is truly the devil's water, you know? It really is. But you know, I was just... You know, I was thinking this morning that maybe if I believed in God like you, maybe I would have some hope and I wouldn't be so fucked up and worried. Believing doesn't miraculously wipe away all your shortcomings. Trust me on that one. And you know that you do this. You did this every time Daddy went away for work, 'cause you were Daddy's little girl. Yeah, well, at least you were his best friend. I was always so jealous of that that you two had that. You were jealous of me? And I was jealous of you? Spoopy. He's gonna be home in a week, all right? Everything's gonna be okay. Don't worry. Having a hot flash over here. What? -Put it back on. -Shut up. You shut up, because I bet you if you take that hat off, you're gonna look just like this. -No, I ain't taking off shit. -Why not? It's just me. Take it off. All right, fuck it. Ooh, yeah. You look like a dried out Chia pet. Well, at least I don't have a hideous moustache growing. -That's so messed up. -Gigi. Do you really think this could be the end? Honestly, I don't know. You really don't believe in God? Honestly, I don't know. Do you? Honestly, I don't know. -No jodas. -No jodas, too. And listen, I'm gonna do a drive by for some weed tomorrow. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I don't wanna hear it. Are you okay? I'll be okay. You okay? Yeah. -I love you. -I love you more. And please fix that hideous moustache. -Bye. -Bye. MOTHER! I swear to God, my entire Instagram feed is sourdough porn. -Bread. Hot. -Yeah, but it tastes awful, though. I mean, think about it, all these stay-at-home bakers. I mean, imagine. They don't know what they're doing. They're just bored and trying to bake. I actually read that there's a whole art and science to sourdough baking. How hard can it be? I don't wanna point fingers, but you burned the pasta last night, so... I'm just saying, but you did. Sam called. Right. Well, I for one would be very up for some fresh-baked sourdough. Really? No, you know the thing is, when this is over, if this ever is over, I don't think that I want to be one of those pandemic sourdough people. -Sorry. -Whatever. He's got his new chainsaw. I'll get us some sourdough starter. It can be my contribution to this whole Little House on the Prairie cosplay. Sure. Does that painting look straight to you? It doesn't look straight to me. I like it better here. Here? Yeah, yeah. No, it's good for now. I don't know if just for now. It's nice. We have fresh air. We have space. I achieve some kind of minimal competence with the chainsaw. We have all the firewood we ever need. Right. But what if we... I don't know, do you think we'd change, if we never went back to the city. Like, then we'd be country people. You'd spend all your time splitting wood and I'd... Darn socks, and knit, and can things, right? 'Cause secretly, you'd like that? Little lady looking after the house while you're busy doing manly things. I do like the idea of being more self-sufficient. -Yeah. -Less wasteful. Yeah, of course. Quite worried about Dory, though. It's got to be strange being stuck up here in her friend's house for God knows how long. And boyfriend's miles away and I don't know, she's not exactly bucolic. No. I don't know. People change. And then other folks, they're gonna say that, hey-o, summertime, civilization returns. Testing, testing will save us. Loyal listeners, you heard it here first. This here, right now, is hunker-down time. I mean, it's not like I'm saying things are gonna be back to normal by then. I'm just saying, there's gonna be some new normal. And that is going to be more like real life than like, you know, like this. Well, I mean, what are people gonna do? Just be like, mmm, well, civilization, that was nice. Shit, that's Sam. Hey. Oh God, I can't believe it's 4:00 already. I've literally done nothing today. Did you order sourdough starter? Black death? Must have been Dory. Does she seem straight to you? She never seems straight to me. I hate that painting. The YouTube woman said you had to wait until it was super buoyant before baking. All right, so let's just clear up some misconceptions, shall we? Prepping's not about a hundred cans of beans in your bunker. It's about being prepared for the day when Grubhub's not delivering. Ready for that day, because if you are, who's gonna be laughing then, huh? Bingo. You are alone. Yeah, look around. That's just that. Those idiots out there infecting each other, so they can drink the cosmotinis. I hope they're happy. Are you? You baking? Tonight, there will be bread. I mean, are we done flying on planes forever? And explain to me how there can even be an airline industry anymore. There's gonna be five people per plane. Explain the economics of that. Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sure you're gonna be able to fly to London and see Sam again. At some point. I'm so glad you like the tagine. I got the recipe off the New York Times cooking app. You should have some more bread. I'm okay. I can feed the mother tonight. You know, for somebody who ordered this sourdough starter as a joke, gotten pretty into baking. I didn't order the starter. Stop. Don't do that. I'll do the dishes. No, it's fine. You guys cooked. But relax. You chopped a lot of wood today. It's all right. Just go watch something stupid on television. Sourdough pancakes look good. Here's a recipe for sourdough pizza. -What have you done? -Jesus. Feed me. Oh, so Europe's opening up. That's a good sign. Yeah, yeah, you think you're going back to work? You're gonna get on the subway with your friends and the COVID passport, huh? Fat chance, fucker. This isn't the end of anything. This is the beginning. I knit you a sweater. Where did this come from? I threw this away. Won't you try it on? -Jesus Christ! -I don't want you to get a cold. -Stop. -It's a pandemic. What is this? Mother. What is going on? I don't want you to get sick. Put on the sweater. Put on the sweater. Put on the sweater. Jim dear. Oh, Jim. Jim dear. We're never going back. This is where we live now. Don't you see? Feed me. Feed me. Feed me. Apparently, it's easy to make yogurt in the Instant Pot. We need cheesecloth. Do you think we could make our own butter? We should get a churn and a cow. Chickens. Of course. Next in line. Step down, please. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just need to get the... Jen, come up to the front. You should have been under 15 minutes ago. I'll take it from here. Thank you. You're gonna get me in trouble. They'll get over themselves. -How are the boys? -They're okay. They've been with Jeffrey's mom in St. Louis this whole time, which is good. But I miss 'em. -How are you guys? -We're good. Giving it over to God. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Stay safe, TJ. You too. Alrighty. Bye-bye. Next in line. Step down, please. Two arms, no head. Two arms, no head. Two arms, no head. Two arms. Hello? -Surprise! -Terumi? I've been trying to call you, but you never answer your phone. -Why didn't you leave a message? -Oh my God! I had to get out of the city and I know that you guys have the pool house. Can you believe there's fucking traffic during a pandemic? Yeah. -Are you looking at my hair? -No. -Please don't. -No, it looks good. Because I had to dye it with Just for Men. It's all they had. Oh, you look really good. You do. You are really still an incredibly bad liar. I'm not lying. I'm so happy to see you. I mean I would be happy to see anyone. Even you, Milly. And I hate dogs. Where are the two Js? They went to St. Louis to visit Jeffrey's mother and they kind of got stuck there. Well, perfect. Then I can stay in Julius' room? Then I don't have to sleep in that crappy bed then, right? -She's taking a nap. -A nap? Or is she passed out? She took a Benadryl, because she said she was having an allergic reaction to something that they put in the eggs. Oh, she was having a really hard time in the city. Jen, when is your sister not having a really hard time? I think it's better when she has a boyfriend. What happened to Eric? Well, they broke up, because he decided he wasn't gonna get divorced. -I didn't know he was married. -Yeah. I thought I told you. No. She is my sister. What was I supposed to say? How about no? It's just gonna be a couple of days and she'll be gone by the time you get home. Well, I'm not exactly sure when that's gonna be. Why? People are traveling. You could drive. Cynthia and Bill just drove to see her parents in Cleveland. I want to see you. No, I just think I need to stay here with Mom and Julius right now. Keep your distance from her. And no hugging. -I don't trust her version of quarantine. -Oh, that crane's back. I'm gonna take a picture and show you guys. Okay, babe. I'm gonna hop off, all right? I'll see you later. Okay. What are sisters for if not to break up with your boyfriend for you? I can't believe that you actually managed to do it. No, but I didn't plan it, you know? You just went to the bathroom and it... I just blurted it out. -What did you say? -What? -What did you say to him again? -Oh my God. I said, you know, "I have... I have good news." -What was his name? -His name was Tim. I'm sorry. "I have good news, Tim. You're free to date other people." Well, it's never been hard for you to be direct. -That's for sure. -Yeah. I got that from Dad. You know, "You look fat in that dress." Oh, you always knew where you stood with him. Actually, I'm really... I'm glad he's not around for all of this. You should see Bleecker Street, Jen. It's a war zone. It's all boarded up. It's sad. I mean, I'd have protested too if I knew I'd get a free Marc Jacobs bag, but... -Hey, T. -Oh, I'm just kidding. Okay? I'm just very grateful that you're letting me stay here. Yeah, of course. Of course, she's letting her sister stay here. Right, Milly? Black dogs matter. Black dogs matter. I suppose this would have been different if Dr. J and Julius were here. What would have? I don't know. Just me staying here. It would have been more complicated. It always is with Dr. J. Hey, you know, he hates it when you call him that. Don't call him that. Come on, Jen. I mean, anybody who's been through medical school is dying for you to call them "doctor", especially when they have completely defied the odds. The odds? He went to Harvard. I think everyone who knows him knows that. -I don't mean anything by it. -You seeing anyone? Lots of people, you know. Really good time to be dating. I watched some old movie with Grandma, went on my phone, played some video games. Just sat around. I went to the supermarket with dad, took a nap. Honey, can you stop moving around so much? You're making me dizzy. -Oh, sorry. -It's okay. Do you guys have any plans for tomorrow? You know, probably the same thing. And in the afternoon, we'll do the march. -What march? -Dad said he told you. But I guess he didn't. Honey, I don't know how I feel about that. Mom, come on. No, because, yeah, 'cause I'm your mom and I want you to be safe and I'm so far away. Mom, this is my time. -It's your time? -Yeah. Actually, it is. Okay. All right, just... Just be really, really careful and don't get into any trouble and don't get swept up in a mob, or anything like that. Do you hear yourself right now? Remember you told me to tell you if you say anything low-key racist? Okay, so just wear your mask the whole time and stay with your father. Don't separate from him at all. At all, okay? And I'm really proud of you. -Okay. I will. -Love you. -Here's dad. -Okay. Dad. Hey. Were you gonna tell me? Well, I didn't want to stress you out, Jen. Aren't you worried about your mother? So, Julius didn't wanna go, because he was worried about her. Then this is what she left by his bed. "J, you are a spectacular gift for this Momma Bear. And I appreciate you worrying about me. There are many times in our life that just being with our friends and family is enough. But now is not one of those times. You are a part of this change. And this is important. You go, and be my eyes, and ears, and voice. And then wash your hands." I'm jealous. I wish I was there with you. I miss you guys. We miss you, too. So did uh, your sister call me "Dr. J" yet? No. She's been pretty decent. Right. What you guys been doing? Um, well, we finished that parrot puzzle, which is really hard. Yeah, 'cause of that piece that Milly ate. And we went for a walk to the liquor store. How is it that liquor stores are essential services? -You look pretty. -You're a terrible liar. So, look, I ordered that inhaler. It should be there for you tomorrow. Thank you. I knew that marrying a doctor was a good idea. -You always were the smart one. -Yeah. You tired, baby? When is this gonna be over? -You mean this call? -No. -I love you. -Love you, too, babe. T? What's going on? You all right? Even the Ambien doesn't do it for me anymore. It's not just you. Everybody's stressed. I'm not one of your patients. I get it. It's a tough time in the world, and all kinds of people are going through all kinds of shit. But I'm talking about me. Me! And it just basically seems that that's not allowed anymore. What's not allowed? Needs or feelings, if you're white. So yeah. I said it, so you can just fucking cancel me. I'm lonely. And I don't have anyone who loves me, so... And I defend you all the time to people. Defend me to whom? Oh my God. My super... Um, people who you think are your friends. Anybody. -Mom. -Mom? Yeah, Mom. Yeah, she never thought that you should have married Jeffrey. She thought that you should have married Daniel from college. -That's because she knows his mother. -No. That's because he was white and she thought that your life would be harder if you married Jeffrey.
