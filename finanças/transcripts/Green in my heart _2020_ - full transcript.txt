Ah, I don't have anything planned except for finishing this production presentation. Alright. There are many delicious restaurants around the Boolkwang-dong area where public servants often go to eat. See you there! Okay, see you there! Hey, my actor, Mr. Cha! Your face is so bright today! So shiny! Ah, so bright. Hey, but your face is more swollen than usual. Even if my face is swollen, I still look better than you. Hey! Am I the one doing a photoshoot today? Huh? You can't say it like that! Argh, what are you doing again! I can hide it! Wow, Manager, when did you get here? I couldn't see you because you were hidden behind Suhyeok! Yeah.... just keep working. Alright, now let's welcome the drama's main actor and actress! This is the actor who plays lawyer Choi Gichan in the drama Natural Romance. Actor Cha Suhyeok, a rising star! Okay. She plays the national goddess, Han Seola, in the drama. Actress Cheon Jieun!! Alright. Next we have the person who swept the categories and got the triple crown at the Unice International Film Festival, and just debuted as the youngest director in Korea! Rising rookie director Han Seorin is coming!!! First, I'm going to ask Cha Suhyeok some questions. Okay. So, actor Cha Suhyeok. I heard that you are ranked as the number one "must-cast" actor in the industry. You've been getting a lot of love calls from various directors because fans really love you! However, you refused all of the offers, and chose to work with rookie director Han Seorin. Is there any specific reason for that? Um, I mean... It's time to film Scene #6. You can cut around here. Ah, you mean cut it here, right? Ah, this is impossible, huh? How can that young director be in charge of this huge drama? I heard that she won some prizes when she studied abroad. Prizes? Honestly, those things just depend on luck, right? By the way, I heard that she's a friend of Cha Suhyeok. Maybe she just got lucky because of her personal connection, eh? Oh, it's Cha Suhyeok. He's so handsome. Hey, Director Han! Is everything going well? Well, there's no problems. So many people are whispering about you behind your back. Like, "The director is too new, she's just a beginner." Things like that. Do you think you should say something to the staff? It's okay, directors can show their abilities through their artwork. I don't have to care about stuff like that. Oh.... so are you gonna prove it through your work? Oh....? Prove it first through your acting. Oh....?! You're still the same. You know, I wouldn't have taken the job if the story was bad. Of course you wouldn't. Right. Hey, what are you, the KTX? Why is there so much talking? Ha! Director team, you guys are lucky. You have the energy to talk. You should have carried some of the heavy things like our lighting team. Then you wouldn't even have the energy to talk. Ha! So, you don't have the energy to talk, but your belly? Argh! What! Hey!! My belly follows the same concept as my father's!! - You're a good son. - Yeah, you're such a good son. Ah, but we have a lot of scenes to film today, right? Who is he? Is he new? Yeah, he is. Hey you! Today's going to be the hardest day for you! Haven't you ever filmed on location? You can't film all of these scenes in one day. Huh! But why..... So you're asking, "Why do we have to stop filming?" Yeah! Because our director Han Seorin has thoroughly managed the time. She calculated the time as accurately as a computer. So accurate! Hey, look at this! Can you feel it?! I mean, this smooth groove we have at this filming location? If someone is really good at something, you only notice their mistakes. Look at your director. His English pronunciation sucks. Hey, then what about your belly? Hey, my wife told me it's sexy! Heyyy, directors. why are you arguing again?! We've started filming! Alright, let's get ready for Scene #17! Ready! Action! ...and chose to work with rookie director Han Seorin. Is there any specific reason for that? Um, because... I've actually liked her for a very long time. Director Han Seorin..... ....her work. We've been really good friends since we were young. So, I guess I've seen everything. Except for the non-make up selfies. Haha, I was joking. I think she's very talented, and a great director, even though she's young. Hahahaha. I was so surprised because I thought you were confessing to the director. Confessing.... Hey, do you really have to go? What, why now, why? I like you. Hey, what are you talking about. We're friends. Friends? Are you sure? That day came up in my mind. The day that I left Korea to study abroad... Hey, Han Seorin. It wasn't just because your work is great. There's one more reason why I chose this drama. What's that? The day that you left Korea to study abroad... Try to remember what I told you that day. My heart still remains same. And when I came back... ...it was like the romance between us had stopped and started all over again. Director. Thank you so much for casting my boyfriend and I in this drama. Alright, let's move to the next question. Ah! Since you two are in a public relationship, you can show your affection for each other! You two look sooo good together! So, you two must have had very good chemistry on set. What do you think, Director? Not really What? Not really? Ah, I mean....two... as two stars... ...they shine so brightly together! Haha Ah, because you studied abroad, you were able to pronounce the R sound so well! Wow! 8-3-1 Ready! Action! Ms. Han, did you prepare the green card? Yes, I did, Mr. Choi. Here you are. If you take the KTX with this green card, you'll receive 5% back in points. Yeah, I knew that already. Alright, let's get on the KTX. Sure. Cut! Why? Director, is this correct? Yes, it's correct! It's PPL! It's too much, isn't it? Let's just ignore it. You think that's the only problem? Then what else? I mean... You said they'll add CG here for the KTX! Why? You want me to change it to the SRT? Why? You want me to change it to the SRT? You also get the 5% for the SRT!! If we film it at the station, it'll be a huge inconvenience for the people there. That's why we decided to use CG! Do we have a large production budget? The drama is from a new director! But the main actor and actress are Cha Suhyeok and Cheon Jieun! Hit Guaranteed Actors! I took a large pay cut because I heard we had a small production budget! Yes, Production PD! Ah, please turn off your phone, go somewhere far away, and then come back! It's...Hollywood... ...vibe! Do you understand? You!! Studied in Germany! Director, I found it! Just now......? Ah, thank you. I think you can keep the same feelings for this part. Um, Director... Suhyeok oppa is... Yes. I heard that you two have been friends for a long time... Is that true? Yes. We've been friends since kindergarten. Ah, then you two really are old friends. Yeah, right... Except for the time I was studying abroad, we were always together. Then... why? I don't have any male friends, so some things are confusing to me when I see friendships like that. Such as...? When I look around at my friends, they always say that their male friends are just friends. But eventually, they all start dating. So, you two are really just friends, right? The day that you left Korea to study abroad... Try to remember what I told you that day. My heart still remains same. Yes. We're just friends. Ah, phew... I'm so sorry to ask you something like that. I actually... like Suhyeok oppa very much. You two look really good together. Really? Director, I appreciate you in so many ways. You kept the fact that you hired both Suhyeok oppa and I to be in the drama a secret. And you told me that we look good together... What are you talking about? You asked for me to be cast as a favor? Yes. Then why? I have the right to recommend the actors that I want to work with. Hey, how can you say that? Don't you know what I'm talking about? No, I don't know. Please think about the difference between private things and professional things. We're at the filming location right now. Hey, you can't say that. When I was offered a role in this drama, I had to really think about whether I wanted to take it because of you. Why? Because I'm your girlfriend? Does that really matter to you, oppa? Hey, stop it. We're not in a relationship. We never were. Alright. Maybe it started like that... But can you honestly tell me that you never felt anything for me? Not even once. Before we started the drama, I was talking with the CEO about releasing an article to say that we broke up. But it's impossible to do that now. How can I release an article that says the two main actors in the drama broke up? So... You'll tell this to the director? That we're not an actual couple? That our company ordered us to do this? Don't make that face. Oppa. You like the director. Did you think I wouldn't notice? I always look at you, but you... ...you only look at her. So, you're going to tell the director all of this... No, I won't tell. I don't hate you enough to make you miserable. Hey, Cha Suhyeok. If you have any respect for me, you'll tell her. I left the script here Oppa. You like the director. Did you think I wouldn't notice? I always look at you, but you... ...you only look at her. Why... Even though I keep saying that we're just friends, I can't stop thinking about that. No, no! Don't finish yet! Don't finish! I made it! I'm here! Production CEO, go away! Production CEO, welcome! The production costs are quite different than what I was originally told. So, the production PD hasn't been answering my phone calls.... I'll be back after I check! After...I check... No. I'm not running away! I don't know anything about that kind of stuff! Don't come! Why? I love you too! Okay! It's sweet, isn't it? It is. It's really sweet. But what good is it for me if this small chocolate is sweet? My relationship was bitter. Ha, my relationship was worse than this chocolate. Hey, stop it. Why are you exaggerating things right after a break up? Ha, never mind. you don't know anything. You don't know the bitterness of love because you've never been in a relationship. Hey, even though I've never been in a relationship, I still know what love is. I know everything. Then what do you know? Never mind, let's not talk about it. Hey, why? I'm the one who just went through a break up. Why are you talking to me like this? I don't know, never mind. Wow! Wow! Our Cha Suhyeok is also really cool today! Camera director. Yes. Do we have enough memory for today's filming? Yup. And enough battery as well? Yup. And the gimbal and drone are ready, too? Yes. What about the equipment that was broken last time? It's been fixed. What about your condition? It's good. What about your physical strength? Um, that's... It's not enough... It's okay. Then... Let's postpone the filming for today. Huh? If the camera director doesn't have enough physical strength, it will be too difficult for him to lift the camera. Let's delay it for just one day. Well, I can still do.....th...a...t Director. Ever since the main actor and actress had that argument, things have seemed kind of weird, don't you think? Yes, very weird. Because that is definitely not the director's style. Director, the lighting is done. Why? Is there a delay? Ah, why! Hey, why! Why aren't you answering me? HEY! What are you looking at? Ugh, seriously! Hey, pack it up! I told you, you shouldn't have followed us all this way. You're working too hard. Hey! Cha Suhyeok is at your door. Uh? He's knocking. Huh? Suhyeok? just a minute. Hey, I don't know why, but did you know that there's nothing to eat at this fancy pension? Let's go buy some food. Okay, tell him let's go. Buy him everything. So, how you will respond to my boss? I don't know. I have no energy to respond because I'm starving. He said he doesn't have the energy to say anything. So, just come inside, okay? Who's that? Is that your boss, the production CEO? Why don't you two just talk instead? Hello? Mr. Suhyeok Cha. Can I tell you something as the CEO of the production company? I'm deeply sorry for running away. Please forgive me this one time. The reason why I ran away is because I'm having a difficult time. I'll do everything I can to make up for your acting fee. But the CG... The CG is making things too difficult! CG! Ah, CG! Holy CG!!! Oh man... Hey, why is it so quiet? Because it's an electric car. No, that's not what I meant. What I mean is, we're not talking at all. Why? Do you have something to say? So, you're going to tell the director all of this... No, I won't tell. I don't hate you enough to make you miserable. Nothing. I knew it. By the way, even if you have something to say, you don't have to tell me. Because I can tell what's on your mind even without you saying it. Know what? You know, when it comes to meat.... ...every single part is love... This meat is love. So, I'll grill the meat for our actor and actress. Ta-da! I'm so honored to be welcomed like this by our actor and actress! Well, we're not really welcoming.... Um, you're shooting early tomorrow morning. Why don't you rest early tonight? Yes, he's right. You do have an early morning shoot tomorrow. Get inside and take care of yourself. No! That makes me sad to hear you say that! The CEO has arrived! I have to say hello and talk to him! I really think it should be Jieun who should go and rest. No, the CEO is here. I'd like to stay here and say hello. Sounds good. You are all so great. This lovely consideration, it's so good, so good. I love it! By the way, how did you two meet each other? Director, I heard that you called the CEO seonbae, right? Us? We met in Germany when Seorin was studying abroad. Germany? Wow... Sounds really romantic. It's not romantic. I established the production company after I returned to Korea, and I scouted Seorin for the company. Ah, I see. So, what was our director like in Germany? Ah, our Han Seorin is a very passionate and talented person! She was very popular! Nahhh, that can't be! There's no way she could be that popular overseas. Hey! You don't know me! How can you say something like that! I liked her too. Hey, what about you? Did you like him too? Are you seriously asking me that? This man likes anyone he sees walking down the street!! Right. Why? Because I'm always open! My mind, my body, my soul, everything is open! It's just sad that nothing is coming in. I've opened everything up widely. But nothing is coming. Why? Why?! Why is that? I don't know. But why is nothing coming? Why?!? Why?!? Why?!? Arrkk! Ah! My heart, my heart. Hey, is anybody there? No, there's no one there. Are you serious? Yeah, no one's here. Uh, what should I do? I'm so lonely. Then, should I be the first to enter? Yes, sir. But no one wants to come in. But they should! Because they don't have anybody else. I'm wide open, but no one is coming in! I need to know the reason why! Hurry up and come in! Someone should stop him. No one... No one is coming in. Han Seorin! Um, do you think filming is going well? Well, the weather is becoming a problem. I can't control the weather. So, the weather is the only thing you can't control? What do you mean? Cha Suhyeok. Ah. He's a pain in the neck. I can't read his mind. Really? Yeah. But you said that you and Cha Suhyeok used to know each other very well. You told me that you wanted to work with him. Did I tell you that? Yes, no? Sometimes I know him, but sometimes I don't. Seorin. Look at the sky. Even though the sky is hidden by the dust, it doesn't mean that the stars aren't there. I mean, there are stars in the sky. And the stars are... My constellation is Aquarius. There's an Aquarius fairy. Don't laugh at me. There really is an Aquarius fairy. The fairy can talk. She always told me that if you remove the dust, in Aquarius.... I'm leaving. Hajun! Did you just mess up the cool thing you wanted to say to me? Hajun [That Same Morning] Here's some water. Hey, just tell the director that you're sick and they'll postpone the filming. Do you think you can solve it by taking pain killers? No, I'm fine, I can still do it. You couldn't sleep at all last night because you were sweating so much. I don't think you can do it. I'll do it. Seorin is still a brand new young director. She will be very pressured if they delay the filming even for just one day. Hey, Cha Suheyok! I know, I know! I thought about this carefully, and I told you. Just tell me if I look sick. No, you don't look sick, you jerk. You're a top actor. Then I'm leaving. Argh, this guy! Wow! Wow! Our Cha Suhyeok is also really cool today! Camera director. Yes. Do we have enough memory for today's filming? Yup. And enough battery as well? Yup. There's a star that can only be seen by my eyes. It may be invisible to everyone else... ...but it's visible to me. Let's postpone the filming for today. Huh? Because my heart has fallen for you. You're always holding that one card. Ah, this one. If you use this card, you can get a discount on transportation. Read this. Why do you have this in your bag? I need to hand it out later for my part-time job. Ah, I was worried about you when you said you just went through a break up, but you live your life so hard! Of course I do. Is that why you thought I would be so upset over the break up? I won't be in a relationship anymore. I can earn money much faster so I can become a director. A drama director I will earn lots of money from now on. How can you earn enough money to film a drama? You need to win the lottery. That's why I bought this. Did you win? Of course not. You can't leave your future to something so uncertain. You sound like my mom. But nothing is ever certain. What? You? Yeah, approved. At least you can be approved. He was right. Everything was hard and uncertain. But there was one thing that never really changed. Hey, do you really have to go? What, why now, why? I like you. Hey, what are you talking about. We're friends. Friends? Are you sure? I'm sorry, I'm gonna be late. I have to go Hey. You've been in Germany for a long time. So, just... ...don't stay there too long. Let's shoot a drama in Korea together. If I go back to Korea, I want to work with Suhyeok. Do you think it would be possible? You said that you're close with him, right? Actor Cha su-hyeok and actress Cheon Ji-eun officially recognized their romantic relationship as "one month in a relationship..."[formal] In the world where everything was uncertain, and everything was changing, I was always nervous. But you were always there. Are you kidding me? This? Geez, it doesn't make sense. You think this is a normal scenario? Seriously. Never mind, he's changed into a high-temper guy. Why? Why was a kissing scene suddenly added here?? What are you talking about? Of course there's a kissing scene, it's a romantic drama! No, what I mean is this scene isn't the right place to include a kiss. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Can the writer just add whatever she wants to any part of the script? What's the problem? Ah, I can't do this. Okay, then what's the reason? Are you really asking as though you don't know? Yup. Hey, should I... Should you what? Should I really shoot this scene in front of you...? [Three Years Ago] I've always thought that you seriously look the same as Byeongtae. Because we're twins. Twins! Then why haven't I ever seen you two in the same place at the same time? Because of the budget. What budget? Because I'm too exhausted. What do you mean? Nothing. By the way, Jieun is... Our super rookie! I'm thinking about creating a fake scandal to release to the media saying that the two of you are dating. It'll have a huge impact. Love, action! Eh, you're kidding me, right? Jieun is talented. So talented. Everything would be great if she could only get some good roles. But to do that, she needs to be quite famous, right? Very famous! What, no way! I don't want that! Then what about my image? Thinking! Think about it. You told me you that you wanted to change your acting style. Change! But you're not getting any job offers that would allow you to do that. Nothing! You always get offered a role as a guy who's never been in a relationship, or a guy that's naive. You're stuck in these roles as an actor. Don't you agree? But imagine if you were involved in a scandal. A man who is thirsty for love... A man who is burning for love... The concept is really good, isn't it? It's time to change your image! All we need now is a... Big change! Right now! Right? No way.... No company would do that. Geez, you don't understand. Ah, this is a good thing for you. Why are you making things so complicated? Let's just do it, huh? Let's do it! Do it! Thank you! Oppa, we need to talk. Hey! Hurry up! C'mon! Have a good time! Oppa, what do you think of me? What do you mean? I feel like you don't think of me as an actress. I know that... I only became famous because of the scandal with you. I was able to get some acting jobs. I was able to become a success. I know you didn't really want to do what they made you do. I also know that you accepted my favor even though you didn't want it. I appreciate you. But then, I began to like you. But I'm not asking you a favor as someone who likes you. I'm asking you a favor actor to actor. So, just act. Act...? Yeah, I can do that, but... Just think a little bit about how harsh you were to me. You wouldn't have acted like that if you had liked me. What is with this strange atmosphere for this kissing scene? Ready! 3-1-1 Action! I thought I would be okay. Cut! But I wasn't okay at all. Alright, it's finally time to end the interview and start the screening. Actor Cha Suhyeok and Cheon Jieun, Is it true that you two really broke up? Hey, what the heck is that?! How should I know?? Ha, what should I do? You should have managed him more carefully! He looks like an anchovy!! I never liked him, even from the beginning! You two broke up, but you still had to act like a couple because of the release of the drama? Seorin's photo is....too... Seorin is more beautiful than this picture, why does she look like that? The reason you broke up with Cheon Jieun is because of the director, Han Seorin? Is that true? Actor Cha Suhyeok! Does this mean that you are in a relationship with Director Han Seorin? Ready! 12-3-1 Action! I thought about it, and I realized that I can't do anything without you. I like you so much! Cheon Jieun asked for a favor. She asked if we could remove the name of her character "Seola" that he was supposed to say right before "I like you" in the last scene. Cut! Okay! The last scene is finally done. Thank you all. You did a good job. Hey, why are you still holding on? We're done filming. Don't worry. This will be the last time. Last time? I mean, you've done a good job so far. So, let's stop. Our public relationship. What’s going on with you? I thought about it, and you were right. Now I can do anything on my own. Alright. I'll support you. Hey! I'll tell the boss... Hey, at least try to act like you're thinking about it for a minute or so! Anyway. The break up article will be released as soon as we are finished with the production presentation. Why? Are you sad to let me go?! Will you call me seonbae from now on? Nah. Oh, are you there? Why did you pretend like you didn't know anything earlier? What do you mean? I'm just telling you in case you misunderstood the situation. Honestly, I'm not in a relationship with Jieun. I don't want you to get the wrong idea about anything. Why would I misunderstand anything? We're just friends. You still can't think about what I said to you, can you? About what? What I told you on the first day of filming. That my feelings are still the same. Think about what I said to you when you left to study abroad. I've been so busy with filming. How would I have the time to think about that thing? That thing? Yes, that thing. Why do you always try to hide your feelings and pretend to be cool? I've always been cool. I don't have to hide anything. You've never hidden anything? Right now, just like you were in the past, you are still only my friend. Wait... what's this? When did we make a train with all of these beer bottles? A train... Chicka-chicka pook-pook Why are you doing that? Are you crazy? tell me. Do you think that I like him? Wow. Wow. Wow, wow, oh my gosh! Is there anyone left that doesn't know that?? Okay. If it's true then... So... If I like him, will we still be able to work together? Hey, Seorin! Just be in a relationship! PLEASE! I think it's become more of a problem for you to be like this. Argh, I should have brought a bamboo spear.... I'm just afraid... I'm scared... Because being friends and being a couple are different. We're really great now as friends. But if we become a couple, we'll have to face the things we don't want to show. I'm not great at all. I'm not cool. I have so many faults. That's it? If..... If we break up one day... We'll never be able to go back to being friends, and everything will end... If someone is the most precious person in your life, isn't it better to find the right way for you to be together for the longest amount of time? Every moment has its ending. Whether it's a real relationship ...or a fake one... Ah, I think I'm too drunk. I'll think I'm going to leave. Ah, it's weird. If there is never a beginning, there will never be an end. Regardless of what my heart thinks, the beginning is already here. Alright, tell us then. How did this happen? Alright, tell us then. Why did you two hide this? Actor Cha Suhyeok. Do you admit that you are in a relationship with Director Han Seorin? Yes, I do. And maybe, my heart was just waiting for that beginning. Why? Wait! Wait! Wait, please! Wait! Hello, everyone. First, I'd like to say how much I truly appreciate the fact that all of you have come here today despite your busy schedules. My name is Lee Hajun, and I am the CEO of the production company. You all seem quite surprised, right? This situation is actually a surprise for our production presentation event! Then what is this picture? Ah, that picture. Let me explain Alright. I took this picture to create a bit of buzz marketing. What are you talking about?! Okay, so the event is finished. It's time for the screening. Hey, why did you say that?! Are you trying to kill me? My wife... My sweet children...! If I was my brother, I would have killed you already. Are you crazy? WHAT THE SHOCK! Huh? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Don't laugh! Actor Cha Suhyeok. Do you admit that you are in a relationship with Director Han Seorin? Yes, I do. Huh? What are you doing? Why are you smiling like that? Do you think I'm a fool? Why do you keep ignoring me? Done, done. It's all finished. Rin, Rin. Han Seorin. Thank you. You saved my life. Why are you thanking me? I did it all for me. I hate him. Ha, how can you admit to being in a relationship with Cha Suhyeok? I can't stand that! I hate him. How dare he have my Seorin! It's not even my turn yet! What? "My Seorin"? Wake up! You keep doing that joke! Because you're won't accept me! Anyway. How did you feel earlier? About what? How did you feel when people kept asking if you two were a couple. It seems like Cha Suhyeok was willing to give everything up just to be with you. Han Seorin. Please try to trust Cha Suhyeok from now on. He's the one you like. Why do you feel like you can only be scared on your own? I mean, why do you have to worry alone? Why do you have to feel like you can't do anything? Those worries, those burdens, you can solve them by being with the person you like. Where are you going? To clean everything up. Hey, Cha Suhyeok. Why are you still here? I'm not a disloyal person, the type that would leave without saying anything. Okay, you saw me, then bye. Okay, I'm leaving. Hey, Cha Suhyeok. I'm actually not cool at all. And, I'm not great at all. And my personality is too stiff. I'm not cool at all! Hey, what are you talking about. We're friends. I don't want to hide it anymore. Yes, we're just friends. I like you. Tell me again. Right now, just like you were in the past, you are still only my friend. I said I like you. So, you... If we are in a relationship, are you confident that you're not going to change? No. I'll change. Huh? If someone is the most precious person in your life, isn't it better to find the right way for you to be together for the longest amount of time? I will love you more and more, each and every day. So, what should we call each other? What about h...honey? I'm shy.
