S?RAPHlN: HEART OF STONE (moaning and groaning) (grunting) (no sound) - Your lad's a frisky one! (laughing) Here. (Donalda): lt was the last Saturday in August. Eleven years to the day since Mom had died. Dad's store was still struggling. Times were hard for north country settlers. Pleasures were rare. At least there were the feast days. l didn't know you yet. l mean, we'd met, of course, but that's all. - lf you're itching to marry, ask Peg-Leg. He's always hanging around you. - And have crippled children? - He'll father kids nice as anyone's. - Why don't you ask him then, Donalda? - l'd have to love him. - Six kids is my limit! - A large family is our duty. - How many do you want, Simone? - l don't want kids. - Simone! Know what Frenchmen call our corn? They call it lndian grain! (cocks crowing) - Yourtwo Jersey heifers, if you pay me the $50 within three months, you'll get 'em back. - You can't mean it, Mr. Poudrier. l depend on them for my butter. What'll my missus say? - There are worse things in a man's life. Sometimes you have to hide them from a wife. Don't you agree, Mr. Lemont? We'll work it out... You had a good winter with yourtrap lines. You must have some fine fox and mink pelts. - Yes, but... - l need guarantees. l'm not the People's Bank. Hurry, Mom, we'll be late! - You're not even dressed! - Will old man Putt-Putt be there? Putt! - Don't mock your elders. Now off you go! What are you doing? -Nothing. l'll repay it all. - How, my poor Bidou? We're up to our necks in debt. - Sure, get mad at your husband! l can clear out, if you want! Careful, Alexis! lt's every cent l own! - Go on! Show him your smithie's fire! - Him? The ladies in St-J?r?me doused it! - That's it, Alexis! Joe! Joe! Joe... lt's not fair! l saw what she did, showing her petticoats! - You beat him! - Just. - Hold it right there. l emptied the till to win back my losses. l'm done for, and it's all your fault again! - You've some nerve, Bidou Laloge! You changed your bet. - Devil take you! - Time forthe fair! - Not Cur? Labelle's colonization scheme! - We can't leave now. ln two years the railroad's coming. - You dreamer! To think you could be practising in St-J?r?me! (fiddle music) Look at those peasants. Hello, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Laloge. Flaunting their Sunday best! - Whoa. - Spunky, our schoolmarm. - Awidow all these years... ln her shoes, we'd do the same. - l find stout women very appealing. Such abundance. They're always so gay and welcoming. Don't you find? Those ladies must cost a lot to feed and clothe. About your building permit, l'll see what l can do. - Thank you, Mr. Mayor. - Why, Father! Your arrival here is a real blessing. Your predecessorwas a holy man, but he lacked self-control. l heard say he stewed in holy water to his neck! - Holy water? -Ahhh! - You must be careful, Alexis. Such charm could make me think you're sincere. You were eight. - l was nine. - l said, ''Go play with your dolls!'' - Do you remember what l answered, smartypants? ''One day, you'll see. l'll catch you!'' - That wasn't a little girl's kiss. - There've been 1000 others. l've practised in my head. (bird singing) Listen! (Donalda): l led you to the tree by the overhang. l'd gone there often, but now everything was different, the light and the forest scents. Despite my apparent assurance, l was afraid you'd make me say ''stop.'' Since it would've been a sin, and l don't know if l could have resisted. - l'll pay by the 30th, l promise. - Don't forget the $8 already on yourtab, Mrs. Brochu. l have to pay my bills too. l knew you'd oblige, Mr. Laloge. - Here you go. - Mail for you, Mr. Mayor. - Tarnation, who'd everwrite me? - lt's from the States. You sign here. - My hand's not soft, like yours, l know. l'm always hard at work. - You know, S?raphin, Quebec's worried about illegal liquor. Even here in Ste-Ad?le. lf they catch wind of Mrs. Malterre... l hearthey even called for an inquiry. lt's causing a lot of talk. - Don't you worry, F.X. The more people talk, the less it's true. That's no way to greet me. Where'd you hide your pretty smile? Who could have lodged a complaint? - They don't say, of course. Quebec wants the Council to suspend Mrs. Malterre's license. - lt's too bad you won't be attending the Council meeting. - Why won't l? - A man can't always do his duty. - As clerk, l have to table Quebec's request. - We have to buy time, Polydor. That's politics. - l can't cheat the people! - Dogsmeat! You're helping the town, not just me! - Faster, she's coming! - Wait for me! - No, it always comes down to age. Still, they enjoyed it. - And sincere repentance? - Oh, l am repentant. But it's not easy for a woman to find herself alone. And.. the Good Lord made me this way... lusty-like. l can't help it, it's in my flesh. (Latin) - What's wrong, Simone? - Nothing! l don't want to talk. - lt seems to be serious, anyway. You haven't been knocked up? - l don't know what to do. The notary's bound to notice eventually. He'll send me away. - Me... lf you wanted... l could maybe give him my name. lf you'd have me. That way... nobody would suspect. And you wouldn't have to work forthat beanpole. - No, you don't see. l don't want this baby. l don't want it! - Don't say that, Simone. Don't say that. - A goddamn complaint. Someone from here must have sent it to Quebec. Someone who can write. - ln Quebec City, anything related to liquor goes straight to their head. - Hey, Ovide, over here! - Yeah, yeah... - l'd pay you back if l could. But l'm out my best fox pelts as it is. To think l voted for him! - l'm worried about your license. Maybe l could convince the notary not to table the complaint in Council. - The Lord would show his thanks, Mr. Poudrier. - Not just yet, l hope. - ln the meantime, maybe we could give you something, for yourtrouble. - No. - When l was a girl, lying in bed, l'd watch shadows flickering overhead. l was terrified it was the bogeyman coming. l'd hide so he wouldn't find me. But l couldn't help looking. - Grrr! - You don't scare me! - l love you, Donalda. - Do you remember asking... if two people, a couple, could be free? - Have you found an answer? - We wouldn't be two for long. But l need to know my dream is shared. - lt's easy to have children. - Don't you want any? - Sure. What's hard is making them happy. And breaking our backs to clearthe land... - So for you Alexis, where does happiness lie? - l want it to be with you, but it won't be here in Ste-Ad?le. Look. We live in a land of riches. lt's our vision that's poor. - What do you mean? - Farms alone won't build a country. On the way to the logging camps, l see lots of lakes... fast-running water everywhere. Wide-open spaces. - You'll be gone a long time? l'm not very patient. But l'll be glad to wait. - l'll come back soon, l promise. Thanks. - l'm at the end of my rope, Father. Each day is a struggle. - l know you're in a tight spot because of your son. (train whistle blowing) - l see, a moral guarantee. A laudable gesture, Father. But insufficient for our bank, in the circumstances. The debt is not a negligible amount, you agree? - All the more reason to act. No one benefits from driving an honest man into bankruptcy. - There may be anotherway. Give me a few days. We'll see what we can do. - Thank you, Mr. Destreilles. - Father... That's that. - Didn't you say you'd learn to read? - lt's true, l did promise you. But... with an empty belly, when it growls too loud... the letters get fuzzy. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, l can't see right. - Here... l'll be gone some time. Make sure it lasts. - Uh... looking forthis? - You magpie! Get your dirty paws... - Must be more serious than l thought. Oh! (child coughing) - $700. ln lovely Dominion bank notes. (coughing) l scraped it together, Brochu, because you asked my help. l'm the compassionate sort, see? (baby crying) lt's strongerthan me. And as town mayor, it's my duty to take care of my villagers. lsn't it, boy? - So we can live here and farm fortwo years? ls that what's written? - Word forword. (coughing) Afterthat, of course, you'll have to leave. (coughing) - Where do l sign? (church bells ringing) (screaming) - l tried to do it myself, with a knitting needle. l know it wasn't right. (crying) You have to help me, Doctor! - Simone, you should've told me. - l'm splitting apart! l don't want to die! l don't want to go to hell! l don't want to burn in hell! (Donalda): That morning, Simone, the town orphan, was buried. Few shed a tear for her, besides Peg-Leg. lt made me so miserable. The doctor did his best to hide his rage. You were right, this land smothers us within. - Will Simone go to heaven? - All orphans go to heaven. (Donalda): Alexis, my beloved secret. l didn't expect to see you after our farewell. l worry the coffin passing between us is a bad omen, with you leaving forthe camp. Life can be so cruel. My love, you were so close to me, yet already you were gone, lost to the dark winter. A shiver ran down my spine. - Must feel strange, winding up in a box, at age 15. - What? (Donalda): All the leaves have fallen. The land awaits the snow. At five o'clock, it's already dark. l think of Simone in her cemetery, and l grow so angry. l worry about Dad. Business hasn't picked up, and still no word from the bank. l await the right time to tell him about us. (Alexis): Your hair gleams in my hand like gold dust, or sunbeams darting on the water. My beauty, spring is so far off. Soon no mail will get through. l won't be able to write. But l can talk to you. l like to wander far from the camp. The land is freezing over. lt's full of silence. The rivers are cloaked in sleep. (birds chirping) - The railroad! We'll be so modern! - Cur? Labelle says in 10 years the Yanks will be piling in. The north country will be the Switzerland of Canada. - Where'd you get hold of this, Dr. Cyprien? - Like our land agent, l have ways. l went to Montreal, to the Official Gazetteer. l'm not English or an engineer, but the railroad passes on Brochu's land. - lt's not the first plan orthe last. Don't let folks see it. They'll get worked up for nothing. - And the unscrupulous might seek to profit from it. - You'd best tend to your patients! - Mine don't end up in graves! - Gentlemen, please. Save your quarrels. - F.X. is right. We still have to discuss Quebec's complaint. - Forget about it, l took care of it myself. - Giddyap! Whoa! - Your pa worries me. l see the bills he gets. l feel like a burden. - l worry how he'll manage if you move to Montreal. Alexis and me, it's serious. We write. - Are you sure you two behaved? - Really, Nanette! - Why, if it isn't Mrs. Virtuous. - She denounced the inn. l saw the letter. - l don't believe it! The notary would have a stroke! My, my. - Can you mind the store a while? - l'll just finish. - $700 isn't robbery. That plan is hot air. l gave you cash. - You cheated me! - l helped you out, at your request. And this is my thanks? - lt's worth 10 times more! lf my lad wasn't here... - Are you threatening the mayor? Think it over, Brochu. - The mayor had inside knowledge. Tell him he can't take it with him! Stay away! He's the devil incarnate! - l extended too much credit. My customers do their best. l can't cut them off. - Having a good heart... Not everyone's like that. - That bank manager had given me hope... l don't understand, we were on good terms... Maybe... Maybe you, S?raphin, with your influence, maybe... maybe you could... - Y'know, in my experience... you can't trust them folk who have pinched lips... But y'know, F.X... maybe l could help you out. l'd sure hate to see you and your family hit hard times. Your Donalda, do yourtroubles weigh on hertoo? - She's strong, but it's hard on all of us. l do my best to spare her. - Such a beautiful young thing. You won't always be there to protect her. What she needs is a good match. A real good match. (clock chiming) - Whoa! You know we have big worries. There's no end in sight. So l spoke to the mayor, S?raphin Poudrier... He's agreed to help us. - With his money? - Yes. lf l give him your hand. - S?raphin Poudrier? He's much too old. - Hold on. Wait. People badmouth him, but he's respectable, a hard-worker. - No, you don't understand. lt's not that. You see, he wrote me. - Who did? - l wanted to tell you. You know him. lt's Alexis. - Alexis Labranche? A dreamer, a good-for-nothing! You're not serious! He can't support you! - Don't say that, you don't know him. He's changed. - lt's my little girl who's changed! - Will you force me? - l want this hardship to end for you, Donalda. - The hardship to end? lsn't that hardship, marrying without love? - Forgive me, my poor Donalda. l wanted us to stay on here. Forget what l said. We'll find a way. - He needs help. We'll lose it all. Open your eyes, Bidou. lt's serious! They'll seize the store! - Bankers just like to scare people. - Don't you realize? After all the money you lost... - lf you must know... your fine Alexis drew me into gambling. - Stop hiding behind others, Bidou! - Speaking of Alexis, didn't you everwonder about Simone? - Coward. You're just a coward! lf you think l believe you... - l can't understand the bank's decision. The worst is, Mr Poudrier offered to help. - At what price? - l'd have to marry him. Father says it's up to me. Every night l pray to the Good Lord. But he hasn't replied. lf ever it comes about... The other day at the store, when he touched my hand... l can't imagine him beside me. - Some choices tear us apart. But in the end, Donalda, you have to follow your conscience. - What if my conscience is wrong? - Ah! - Ah!! - Ah...! Don't look at me like that. l even messed that up. Do you see? l just wanted... - Stop torturing yourself. - l don't deserve a daughter as fine as you. HERE LlES MARlE-LOUlSE MlGNERON - Mama! Mama... - The mayor's unfit to marry before the Good Lord. - Really? Why is that? - My poor Simone... She tried to induce a miscarriage. lt killed her. - You think S?raphin got her pregnant? - She told me so. - Are you certain? - l took her in when her parents died. lf Simone said so, it's true. - l expected you in church, Mr. Poudrier. As you know, you must confess before marriage. lt's an obligatory rite. - Two and a half. Not if one has nothing to confess. - Examining his conscience never hurt a Christian. l've heard talk in the village, a young orphan girl... lt could prevent your getting married. - That would be a pity. A pity for you, Father. Don't you think? l've also heard talk. lt so happens l have good friends at the diocese. That widow in Trois-Rivi?res... l'm sure it's only idle gossip... Like about that orphan girl. People are just jealous, right, Father? - Are you sure of your decision, Donalda? - Yes. l'm going to need you, Nanette. - l can't accept what you're doing. l feel like it's my fault. - lt's no one's fault. Will you go back to Montreal? - lt's not as urgent, now that your father's situation has improved. l swear no one will ever know why. Wait... Here. - lt's for me? - Mm-hm. To bring you good luck. - Thanks. (child singing Ave Maria in Latin) (baby crying) - lf anyone here present knows just cause against this marriage before God and man... let them stand and speak, as is their duty. (coughing) Do you take Donalda Laloge as your lawfully wedded wife? - l do. - Do you take S?raphin Poudrier as your lawful husband? - l do. - Place this ring on her finger, as a pledge of fidelity and love. Place this on his finger, in fidelity and love. (church bells ringing) (Latin) - lt must've gone out. - No, it wasn't lit. We don't heat when no one's home. We have to save if we don't want the winter to last forever. A stove's not the only way of keeping warm. (grunting) (groaning) (snoring) (Alexis): My beautiful wildflower, our love has made a new man of me. l count the days, l count the hours. The snow is finally melting. - l have to go to the village. We're out of buckwheat. - Don't waste time gabbing. You have work to do. - l could buy some butter. - Butter? Dogsmeat! lt's much too expensive. And it gives you lumps in your stomach. - My father'd sell it cheap. Maybe even give it to us. - l said l don't want any. Bad habits get you nowhere. lf you save, you want for nothing. That's how the Good Lord arranged things. - You want us to save... How'll we manage with children? - Children? No danger of that. Not just yet, anyway. l'm as poor as dirt, Donalda. We have to go on scrimping, and forget... about any extras. - lt's religion that invented sin so that man would not prey on man. - When S?raphin comes to me... You understand... l still think about Alexis. That's a sin of impurity. And... - Yes? - lt helps me endure it. - Temptation isn't a sin, Donalda. By resisting it, we keep on living. - To keep on living, l'll have to rip my heart out. - ln the middle of the night? - lt wakes me up. At night l hear him moving about. lt scares me. - You've never been in the attic? - He wears the key around his neck. l'm worried l'm late, Nanette. ln womanly things, l mean. - You're in the family way, then? - lt sounds crazy, but it's almost a relief. When Alexis hears, he'll have to forget me. That's what's so awful. - l don't know what to say. - Donalda! Here... the last strawberry jam. l'd put it aside for Mrs. Le Potiron. We're making sugar pies. l'll bring you some. - S?raphin doesn't like visitors. - Here... l wasn't sure... l've had them a month. l couldn't bearto burn them. - l've something for you too. They were Mom's. - But why? - l don't want her to be in that house. (Alexis): Freedom means choosing your destiny without worrying what others will say. lt's standing up when everyone is on their knees. Now, with you, l understand it's truer still fortwo. At night, l dream about our children, about my desire for you. How proud l'll be when you tell me you're carrying our life! ...the hope of seeing you, (Alexis and Donalda): and loving you passionately. Your Alexis. - Devil! l thought you'd died! lt's been hours. Always the same when you go into town. Did you buy anything else besides the flour? - My father lowered the price, so l got a bit of butter. Dogsmeat! l said we didn't want any! - l like it. - You spent the change! How will we manage if you're so wasteful? And behind my back! - l did nothing wrong! Do you know how much l gave your father? Think about that! - My poor friend, it must hurt. - l guess l caught a chill. l'm pissing needles! - You don't catch that chill alone. ''May the venereal fires lit in lust (together): and fanned by quicksilver - flow in your fundament!'' Gargantua? - No. Pantagruel. l still attend the Literary Club. You could come next time. Speaking of quicksilver, Alexis is back. Lock up the ladies! - Marie-Ange! Quick, tell Donalda there's a surprise for her. - She doesn't live here now, she's married. - Oh yeah, and who's the lucky fellow? - Mr. Poudrier. - S?raphin? Cut it out, you scamp! Go tell her! - l'm not a scamp. And you're mean! - Not much of a wedding. lt was deadly dull. lt felt like a funeral. lt wasn't even a sung mass. - The mayor's wedding... l bet the church was full. What's everyone afraid to tell me?! - S?raphin must've wooed her good. And with his money... - lt doesn't make sense. l can't believe she'd do it. - Hardship begets hardship. Sometimes it makes you desperate. - Ahem! Well, l'll be darned! Alexis and Donalda? - Yes. - Did S?raphin know about it? - You better not tell him. You'll sleep in the shed till Christmas! - l know which side my bread's buttered on. Don't l, my little Victorine? - Alexis? Alexis, l know you're here! Don't come any closer. - l'm back from the end of the earth... so we can get married. And l find you with S?raphin, in his house, in his things. ln his bed! How could you? Look at me when l'm talking! - l'm looking at you. - Do you remember? ''Alexis, my lovely promise.'' l can't believe it. This isn't you. This isn't us. The goddamn cold! The goddamn silence! The nights spent dreaming like an idiot! - Alexis. l'm expecting. - Stop, you're throwing away yourwinter's wages! Stubborn ass! - Alexis, you should quit. - That's enough! Come on, let's go! - Did you ever...? l've never seen such bad luck! - Unlucky at cards, lucky in love. - You've stared at the window for a week. You'll end up making him appear. - Who? - The devil incarnate. - lt's not a good night, S?raphin. - l can't remember the last time it was. Open your eyes, you look like a corpse! - Well, if you don't want to start a family... - Don't worry, Alexis, you just drank too much. - That damn hypocrite! Ensnaring me with those big eyes that can break your heart! Blazes, l'm such a fool! (baby crying) - l can't believe you let her! - Donalda didn't refuse him. - That's not the same as agreeing. Anyway, to me the marriage doesn't count. - She was married before God. - Her father! Where's your heart? lt's like she's buried alive! - Times are hard, she could do worse. - That is the worst! - You say that because you're jealous! - Because l love her! - Huh! - Can you say as much? - You dare talk of love, Alexis Labranche? Even without S?raphin, l'd never give herto you. - You didn't give her away, you sold her! - Ouch! (thunder) Let go of me, Alexis. You mustn't come here. - We have to talk. - l beg you. - l know everything. - Stop, Alexis. He'll notice l'm gone. - You lost the baby. Nanette told me. You married to save your dad. Tell me it's true. Why don't you answer? Say something, anything. - Alexis... You've come, Alexis. You've come. - l'll take you with me. We'll go far away, where no one will find us. - That's impossible. - You can't go back. - lt's tearing me apart inside. - Sacrificing yourself for your dad, Donalda! Wake up, please! - l'm awake, Alexis. No dream hurts like this. - Donalda!! - l'll have you know, wife, l have no truck with sin. l work like a dog. l've no time to be tempted. Not like the teacher, who acts like the Madonna but... Why were you in the woods in the pouring rain? - No reason. - Are you hiding something? - l swear, S?raphin, l did nothing wrong. - lt would be unchristian-like to tell falsehoods to your husband. (grunting and groaning) - ''The corpse was in... a state of... advanced decomposition...'' - However long it takes, l'm staying. You worked hard, Peg-Leg. - l enjoy it. As for you... Donalda will never leave that damn S?raphin. Never. You'd better face up to it, now. You've no prospects, and you're losing your land. - You understand nothing about women. With your gimpy leg, they run when they see you. (Donalda): You've been back for months, and still you toil, clearing your land. A dozen times each day l must stop myself from going to see you. lt breaks my heart to know you are near, but it'd be worse if you left. Tell me, Alexis, when did love become a punishment? - Quit loafing and come help, dammit! Thanks. - Don't thank me. We're supposed to be mad. Stubborn mule! So you decided to stay? - l'm not out to clearthe whole county. l'm here just to be here. - l almost like you when you're crazy. - l saw you proposed granting a delay before auctioning off Alexis's land. With all his hard work, he'll be able to pay his back taxes early. - l don't see how he could manage. Even now, he'll barely meet the deadline. - You're too generous. He's played you good. He pays up in two months. We've been patient. - Not just with him. - l thought we understood each other, Polydor. - Yes. But in his case-- - Stop, you're making me cry. Don't forget the matter of my father's will. Why, Mr Fournier, how's your family? - The winterwas hard on my lad. - Uh-huh. - Say hello to the mayor. - Hello. - lt's very sad to say, but... l think l'll be selling a tiny coffin soon. l'll see you at Council tonight. - My, my. l hope he makes it. His burden is a heavy one. - Alexis is as stubborn as a mule. - He'll manage, he's as solid as they come. lf l could, l'd go help him. - Only one person can help. And she... is caught in a trap. - Call that a trap? The guy has piles of dough. - And a heart of stone. lsn't that right, Mr. Notary? - Perhaps we should mind our own business? - Sure, there's nothing on your conscience. - Are you superstitious? - Depends... - The other night l left out a basin of water, soap, a comb and towel... - Did you dream of a man? - Yes! He washed himself right in my bedroom! - That's a good sign. Who? - l thought l was past the age... that l could never love another. - Who was it? - He treats me like a lady, and never rushes to finish. - l had my dreams as a schoolgirl too, but Polydor's no prince charming. And here in Ste-Ad?le... - This isn't candy, Mrs. Le Potiron. - My nerves are in such a state. - l have a little favourto ask. l need D?lima's address in the States. - D?lima? S?raphin's sister? lsn't she dead? No one mentions her. - Your husband must have corresponded with her. - You're not asking me to snoop? - A minor indiscretion can prevent another one being revealed. - What do you mean? - Your letters to Quebec City. - Ho-ho. - You're crazy, Alexis. We won't make it. - Just get to work. - Trooper can't haul that. - That goddamn notary! He changed sides at the meeting. That damn bastard S?raphin! They won't beat me, blazes! Pull! Come on, Trooper. Come on! Pull! (neighing) Pull! Ahh! - Alexis. (neighing) - Thanks, Trooper. - Dogsmeat! Such a fine animal. Sure is a shame. - Keep your pity for yourself, you need it. - When they've worked so hard, do you think there's... a heaven for horses? - l'm not sure there's one for animals like you. - A loaded shotgun is dangerous, Alexis. You can't kill him twice. - lt's not for him. lt's forthe wolves. - No one's seen any around here in ages. - l wouldn't say that. - lf they could, l know the Council would grant an extension. lt sure is too bad. - How can you stand yourself? Heartless bastard! - Arghh! - Oh! - Ahh! Ahh! (both panting) (rooster crowing) - S?raphin? Good Lord, what happened? Did you fight? - None of your business. - Not with Alexis? Why, S?raphin? - Because... you're mine. And he won't have you. - You have to leave, Alexis. (crying) - l know this can't go on. But l won't leave without you. - l wanted to make you happy. Now l've cost you your freedom. l can't stand seeing you suffer. Go away. Go far away. For my sake. - l don't mind suffering for you. But if l leave you... how will l live without my torment? How? - l don't know! l don't know. Please, go away. Alexis, go far away. - Whoa... Mr. Mayor, as the official town recorder, l have to tell you people are gossiping... Many are on Alexis's side. - You saw him again. - We just talked. - Think l'm stupid? You'd not be the first wife he's... - l didn't cheat on you. l neverwill. l tried my best to love you. But l can't. l even prayed, but God didn't answer. lt's true that l love Alexis. And l always will. But it will go no further. l know my duty. - l've done my best so we neverwant for anything. That doesn't seem to count for you. You're like every other female on earth. You're ungrateful. (door slamming) (Donalda): At times l hated you, Alexis. l hated you for listening to me, and for leaving me forever. When the leaves turned red, l felt lost, like in the forest on a moonless night. Even the silence frightened me... and the emptiness everywhere. l'd become a stranger to everything around me. (rattling) How can it be, Alexis, that there's not even a tiny spot for us in a country as vast as this? (children whooping) - lt's D?lima. - D?lima? - Thank you. Wait for me here, it won't be long. - lt's surely no more than... an unfortunate error. - Come off it. You'd have to be very naive to think l'd give up my inheritance. Very naive, or very conniving. - D?lima, really! That's unfair. The letters must have gone astray. You've been away so long. - You've changed, poor man. Never leaving one's hole must do that. - You had only to come see me. - ''...the share of the estate mistakenly remitted to S?raphin, who was unable to duly inform said D?lima of the sums rightfully owed to her.'' - You've been in the States so long. We've had no news. We feared there'd been... a tragedy. But now you're here. The money... is yours. But l'm going to need some time to collect it. - Your sister D?lima is allowing you 24 hours... to remit the sum you owe her. Failing which, l've been instructed to proceed and seize your land. - ls that a threat? - Twenty-four hours, not a minute more. - Madam! Madam... He can't find that sum so fast. He's lent it to folks in need. We live like paupers. - Marie-Louise's girl? You look just like her. - My mother's been dead many years. - Yours was an arranged marriage, right? - No. No, it was my decision. - Poor little girl, you haven't even learned how to lie. - Slowly, slowly... (door creaking open) - A coffin in white pine with four handles... $3 isn't too much. l always keep a couple on hand. You never know when death will pay a call. - This one's too small. That one's too big. - l'll have to make one to measure. But it'll cost you more. - l can't pay more. - l saw your lad the other day. This one'll do, you just have to squeeze him in a bit. - You know it's too small! - Get off me! - For God's sake, S?raphin, make him another coffin. You have enough money. You feed off misery. - Step aside. - l won't step aside anymore. You'll make him another coffin! - What did you say, Donalda? - l won't step aside anymore. l'll end up hating you! - Giddyap, Reaper. - Alexis? Alexis, tell me you're here! (quiet praying) - What are you doing here? - Nanette, tell me the truth! - The truth? - l feel like he's behind me, like he's watching me. lt can't be so. Tell me it can't. Swear he's gone for good! - Stop frightening me, your mind's running wild. Let's go. - No. No, no. l'll fetch you something hot to drink. Don't move. - Alexis... l knew it!

Answer me! Dogsmeat, will you answer me? Donalda... l'll light the stove, just for you. - Gently now. lt'll do you good. Shush... That's it. That's it... That's better. Shhh... Easy now. - You didn't go see the doctor? - l don't want to get better. - l won't let you do it! - For once l'm thinking only of myself. Do you understand, Nanette? - Shh... - The doctorwas called to Saint-Agathe. Until tomorrow night. - To think she won't see Alexis. - What can we do, Nanette? He left town without a word. - He's at the Red River camp, l know. Forget it, the roads are blocked. You can't make it. - l will. - Are you mad, in this storm? (coughing) (coughing) (heavy breathing) (speaking Latin) (coughing) - Nhum... Mnuh... l... l looked into my heart. Everything has become clear. l'm not afraid like before. - l'm with you, Donalda. - Push...! - Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with Thee. Blessed art Thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit... - Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners. - Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with Thee. Blessed art Thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus. - Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. - l don't believe it! - Whoa. - Bidou! Thanks! - Go on, hurry! Dogsmeat! - lf you think l'll let you... - That's enough! - She held on, waiting for you. - Donalda... - Alexis... - My love. - My love. My one and only love. - l can't officiate at your daughter's funeral. - You've lost me, Father. - Don't call me Father anymore. l'm leaving the priesthood. l'm in love with a woman. l want to live openly. - That takes courage. l've lost everything. - lt was your daughter who gave me that courage. - My little Donalda? - Life is unfair. So unfair! - Our silence killed her. (Donalda): lt's dark. The room is freezing, l'm shaking with fever. Nanette's here, as usual. She'll deliverthis letter. You're here too, Alexis, so close. Your presence is like rays of light in the darkness. l feel at peace. l know l am leaving for good. This time l shall be with you, at last. - That's me! That's me! That's me! That's me, burning! That's me, burning! That's me burning! Giddyap! Giddyap! Dogsmeat. (coughing) - Whoa! (screaming in despair) - S?raphin!
