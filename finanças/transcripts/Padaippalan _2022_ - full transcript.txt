See there.. You can't see anybody there! - It's completely dark... go, go! - Yes sir. They buy properties on ECR worth millions, and go someplace else! Just so that they can live luxuriously, carrying out business and other dealings... and rent out these horses for those who want to drink and party! What Panneer, does this island seem odd to you? Yes, because of such places the girls become addicted to drugs. Then they come to the police saying he touched me or abused me! And we have to resolve all of it! You are already cribbing about this, it hasn't been a month since you arrived! I have been here for the past 5 years! There was nothing here back then, just Redwood groves and water on three sides! Nowadays, there is a resort or something every few feet. What do you think all of this is for? Boys come here to have fun, they bring girls and different kinds of drugs as well! We cannot even question anybody. These influential people pay money to keep it all quiet! Either the parents should raise the kids properly, or those kids should learn from what their teachers teach, but they don't. On top of that now there is a law that prohibits teachers from beating students! That is the end of everything! How can we have ever reform safety! But that is not our job, what is our job...? You should do the work given to us and only be bothered about our family and children. You are right sir, they have built houses in this darkness? Panneer, these are not houses... all of these are resorts! This is the Olive island, surrounded by water on 3 sides! No matter what happened here, nobody will know anything! It's a miracle if I ever patrol here! Nobody will come with me! I am just an inspector for name... I would patrol here alone on the bike, It would be like living with a ghost! Oh no! What are you saying sir? Listening to you, I am really afraid! You'll get used to it, as I have over the years. On the other side there are a lot of properties bought by actors. Look a car, must be a son of a big-shot. Stop the car. Hey, stop the car. - Where are you coming from? - Resort sir. - Huh? - Resort sir. Who is that? - I am just a friend, sir. - What...? I am just a friend, sir! Sir, friend! - Oh, friend? Tell them to go. - Sir... sir...! Hey! Give this to her as well, go! Giving me money... move your car! Look at the bugger! Not down the number. - TN 09 BS 7890. - We might need it later, go! - Panneer, go back... I thougt I saw a car. - Yes sir... Shine some light on it. So it looks like the white coloured BMW! Honk the horn. - They are not responding to the horn. - Go and have a look what is happening! Go. Worthless buggers, he must have some girl with him! J2 police station Inspector speaking... over. I am out patrolling in the Jeep. Keep them in the station I will be back soon... over. Though a police officer is approaching, they have no fear whatsoever! How do their parent allow this kind of behaviour? Why are you circling the vehicle? Who is inside the car? Sir, there is nobody inside! Have a good look. To hell with them... at this ungodly hour! He is scaring me! What am I to do with him? I am coming! - Sir, sir! Sir... sir! - What happened? Hey, what is it... why are you running? Sir, sir... sir! Inside... there is... some horrible... Hey, he must be passed out drunk! - What is with you? - Sir! No sir... You please come and have a look. - You won't listen to me! - Come. Give me the flashlight. I have never seen something like this, sir! Don't be afraid. Are you sure you saw somebody inside? - Sir, it looked like a human... - Don't say whatever... What kind of horrible killing is this? That is what I told you sir. The flies have gathered around him! It looks truly horrible! - Yes sir. - Hey, come here! Hold the flashlight... Control room... control room... Kanathur Inspector reporting... Next to the Olive Island beach... in a white BMW car... TN 01 AU 0786 there is a decomposing body make an entry of it... over. Oh... it looks horrible! Mic 2 Calling, Inspector Kanathur... send a 108 Emergency Ambulance immediately. Location, Kanathur Olive Island Beach. I'm waiting... over. 'PADAIPPALAN' [Creator] Today in the film industry... The hottest and most concerning topic is 'Story-Theft'. Is the story of the movie 'Vakaalan' stolen or not? To discuss this topic 4 esteemed guest have come to our studio. Firstly, is the story of the movie 'Vakaalan' stolen? The notion of stolen is entirely wrong. The truth is good directors have good stories that we listen to... Do you really listen to stories? Only because we do, we can make good movies... through our production as you have seen. Sir, you have never called an assistant director... to sit and narrate a story for over an hour! How can I make these many movie without ever listening to any stories? Sir, I never said you haven't ever heard a story! The people working in your company steal and present other people's stories to you. A director brings me a story... I can only ask him if the story is his. I will not know if it is somebody else's. - They might have heard it from... - Sir...! someone while they were drinking tea. We don't know that, when they come to our office if we like it we make it. How do so many of them tell their stories to directors who make movies for you. They are standing in front of writer's union and director's union! When they cannot reach an agreement they will go to the court! Yes, to earn money they want to cheat me! The only person cheating here is you! This is not the first time, he is a habitual thief! After I have spent Crores they come and try to get easy money off me. - I don't want to talk anymore! - As per the writer's union, any movie... Being made by a certain director who has previously had similar controversies and reached a compromise 3 times before! - Now the movie he is making... - Look everybody can have a thought, Sometimes those thoughts can be the same. Two people who have written a very similar story! After one person makes it, the other comes and says this is my idea! I had already written and registered this... Many Assistant Directors who have good stories... And I have seen them protect it as their own child. Just the other day there was a similar issue in our office. Someone who runs a school wants to make a movie... When we were discussing it one person went and registered it. Now when we want to make this movie he is claiming the story is his. But they have in their agreement that the story is theirs. As he had signed it they are safe, So unless the thief reforms there is no hope. So as a chief correspondent, Now that you have heard their grievances. Do you have any conflicting views? We can write a poem, in just 2 lines... The educated have no work in Tamilnadu, but an actor can get all of it! All of this seems to be headed that way. Cinema is a very powerful media! Let me just say one thing. Can anyone tell me a new family subject that is not similar to any in the Ramayana? This problem will not exist if those who write stories willing let go! But stories take time and effort to create. Then take time and do it! But when we can't feed ourselves what can we do? You have to fight your battles! Just to create one story it might take over a year! Every production house is started... with the intention that everyone working there must have a good life. Only then other can come here and make more movies. With out a production house who will make movies out of their stories? Those who are in prison for 10 to 15 years have left their families on the streets. - What are you talking about? - So I shouldn't be concerned about them? You all live selfish lives and don't care about anyone else! You know nothing about history, The Kamaraj the Kakan... You al live singular lives with no other concerns! All you want is success in cinema! School kids are taught that success come to those who work hard. Don't just scream, you can say this softly! If you keep blaming others, there won't be any more movies! Without directors and creators there is nothing! How will you make movies without a producer? - What is you final point? - The day in Tamil Film Industry... Individual producers left and Corporate producers like them arrived! Since then these Story-thefts have increased! I can only produce movies for good directors with good stories! Only good movies will reach the audience! Why do you have to steal those from struggling up-comers? - What are you saying? - He is saying you are a thief! Hey look here your movie was a flop! Just a minute, everybody calm down! - I will do only want is right for me! - And you will decimate everyone else! - Please everybody calm down! - I will make movies and release them! Sir just a minute, please keep calm!

How much time will it take? - Just one hour sir. - Begin. A trust called Padaippalan sir... From this trust, six kids go on vacation to Kodaikanal to an old bungalow!

In the British isles, lived Mr Robert Cook and Elizabeth They had a son called Mark Henry and a daughter named Ruth They were Jewish people... Because of poverty in the family, Ruth joined service in St. Francis Church at a young age. In a few years Mark Henry though his hard work became a successful business man. Ruth arrived to Kodiakanal to serve along with father Simon, She started her missionary service to the Tribal people living in the hills. After a few years Mark Henry came to Kodikanal to see his sister. When he did, he gifted his sister an amazing gold rosary. It was blessed at the hand of Pope Jhon Paul the 2nd. Looking at the service work his sister was doing he built her a house nearby. He lived in the house for a few months with his sister. Ruth thanked him and told him she would stay back and serve the tribes for the rest of her life and sent him back to England alone. Ruth continued her missionary service, that is when a horrible incident occurred. Some fanatics in the area thought she was forcible converting their people. They attacked, burnt and buried her alive near the bungalow. They kept her gold rosary on her grave and didn't allow her to attain salvation. All of them had neared their death! Neared their death! Veronica... Where are you both? Hey Veronica! Che Guevara...? Veronica...? Che Guevara...? Veronica...? Oh God! Castro...! Rose... what happened? - I asked what happened? - Open the door...

So that your lives can be saved! But those murderers burned and buried me alive! Parrots eat fruits. Eagles peck on corpses. Both of the same species, but each differs in quality and nature.

I will steal one of these stories and become a big time director! It is truly a good attempt by you! Muttaiah... You should never steal from a thief! Understand...? Be careful, he won't start a movie with you... He will end you completely! - Keep your mouth shut! - Okay sir. Sit and do your job. If it was possible I would've done it by now! I have to keep committing this sin in the end! Sit, sit. Then, what about the case details? Sir, we picked him up last night. Now he is at our place. Money, drinks and girls... who is capable of refusing these? A man leaves one political party early one morning... evening of the same day he gets an MLA seat in another political party! Reason... its money sir, money! Its always money! Well, this is the only sentimental and idiotic state. At tonight's party, he will fall in line. Cool sir, cool.

Do you know what this is called...? Being a traitor to your motherland... and stealing somebody else's creation is the same! Try to feel the pain of a director...! Don't any of you have a conscience? Get lost you... - What's your problem man? - Hey... you are all a bunch of thieves! Hey, get away! I mean... It is because of people like you that we are living on the streets!

Sir, truly it is my story sir. - Which is your native? - Pudukottai. How many more like you have come here for this? No sir. I swear this is my story! I was the one who gave that company my story! I am telling you the truth sir. Hey, I am making a movie with a budget of 100 crores... Now you're telling me this is yours, how many more like you will come? Sir, it is the truth. If I give you Rs.300, will you be able to spend it? Sir, they are cheating you. Please support me sir. I swear, this is my story. Hey, don't keep saying that. You are still alive because you are one of us. What... you want to live, right? You can live on. Just withdraw the case and get on with your life. What, do you understand? Sir, just do me one small favour. Please sir. Truly sir, I don't want any money. Just give me a title for story and dialogue. - Hey... hey...! - I have been struggling for 20 years. I am telling you way to stay alive, but you keep saying the same thing! Just go and withdraw the case. Don't they say anything else outside! What is he saying director? - He is being very stubborn sir. - What... - Okay? - Sir, he is a beggar... give him some money. Instead of that why take such a big risk for him? - Do what I say! - Okay sir! Hey, the producer just spoke to me. Do you have fixed a time for you. They are very bad people. They will not listen to me! - I am telling this for your good. - Just give me a title for story sir! - Please sir! - What is with you? You are tormenting me like a madman! You won't get this happiness even after you direct your first movie! Listen to me, withdraw the case, take what they give you and run away somewhere! At least you will be alive! Why... why have you done this to me? 'Again the same night - 12pm' I won't leave who they killed me Sir...? What is this, he is nowhere? Sir... What is this, sir? You will say you will call me after you read the script... Then you will tell us to get the dates of big stars! But all of them will say they're busy for the next 5 years! When I return to come and see you, you will ask who I am! Then you will use somebody's else story and make a movie with a successful director. My sweet gorgeous... for you is waiting, a chance to be a heroine! Every now and then give a chance to me also. Come my sweetheart! Show some more love for me darling.
