This is my honeymoon! You just bought yourself a real bull. When's the last time you bought any bull semen, pal? This is a $100,000 bull. * Nobody said * It was gonna be easy * It's only as hard As it seems * But... ** [HARMONIZING VOCALS] MAN: It started, three of us: me and Doc and Honey. Doc and Honey got married, but it was still the three of us. Honey got pregnant again. Pretty soon, it was just me and Doc out there, hacking our way through showbiz hell. [DOC SINGING] * I've seen The sweat streak * * The pain on your face * And you're Caught like a clown * * In a circus Of strangers * * Who do you screw To get out of this place? * * It's one for * The money * And too far * To go * Three fingers * Of whiskey * Good for * The soul * There you go, Doc.

Everybody, out. You heard me! The lady said everybody out. BLACKIE: * Somewhere above Everybody, out. * Your finest performance Out! * Approaching perfection * I know What you're making * Bye, Daddy. * Is some kind of love * Somewhere * In your lifetime What am I doing wrong? [WHISPERING] Do it like you did it last night. [BACKGROUND MUSIC CONTINUES] * So many emotions Oh, hurry, honey! BLACKIE: Doc's got a real healthy imagination, which cost him a couple of wives and most of our money before leading him to the stunning conclusion that songwriting was making somebody a whole lot of bucks. Since it obviously wasn't us, it had to be "them," he immediately quit the road forever to be a mogul, leaving it up to me and the boys out here to be the keepers the flame. You want a statement? I'll give you a statement. Our relationship is going to last forever, maybe longer. REPORTER: Doc, does this mean you're not gonna sing anymore, you're just gonna produce? Is Blackie on his own? One more time, son. We're with you. BLACKIE: Pick up that guitar. * Go break a heart... BLACKIE: Doc's ace in the hole in this world full of wheelers and whackos and dealers and old obligations and too little time is a burning commitment to living by his wits without stooping to work. Good morning, Doc. So far, he's semi-succeeded, thanks to innocence, audacity, and a flat refusal to let himself be out-gangstered by some fat guy in a suit. This one fell asleep with his beer in his hand... You see, in the music business, just like in real life, it's a day-to-daily war between the sorry and the soulful. No rule says the righteous gotta win, but I'm putting my money on a con-man gypsy bad-ass true-blue legendary bandit hero, and when it's all over, they can say he did it for the love, but he was not above the money. Well, you know, next party we have, we ought to get us a valet. A valet with a mallet. WOMAN: Mobile operator. May I help you? Hello, operator. Get me the Ramada Inn in El Paso, please. MAN: Hello, Ramada Inn? Hello. Get me Blackie Buck's room, would you, please? [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yo. Hello, Blackie. I knew you'd still be up. What time is it there? How did it go? Oh... Full house. They got a little rowdy. I bet you didn't have nothing to do with that, did you? I did the second set with my back to the audience. Glad you haven't lost your sense of humor. You need anything? Yeah, my old singing partner. He went on to bigger and better things. Bigger? By the way, if you hear of a girl singer, let me know. I need one. I'm looking for one to produce. Matter of fact, I got one with me here now who sounds a little bit like Hoyt Axton. [SNORING] RADIO DEEJAY: Here in the heart of Nashville country, it's 57 degrees with partly cloudy skies, clearing up this afternoon to let the sun shine through. The high today in Nashville should be around 62 degrees with overnight low in the upper 40s. The morning traffic report-- Good morning, Doc. Good morning. What do you want to hear? I don't know. How'd I do on drums? Great. You played your ass off on the bass last night. I can't play bass. You played bass last night. Is my guitar hooked up? Sure is. Good morning. Sorry I'm late. You're always sorry, and you're always late. * Always late You're playing everything else in this here supergroup. Why don't you play the fiddle too? Because you play better fiddle than I do. Also because I want to stack some fiddles when we get through. Since it's just two of us in the group, how about me naming the band? All right. The Eleven Dixie Mudcats. Hi, Roy. That is not what he said. He said you've got to pay me $1800 a month on an every-month basis, not just every now and then. How much do I owe you? You're back five months, and you wrote me a check, and it bounced. Bounced? The bank must've screwed up. I sent it back to you. It bounced again. I'll write you another check. Honey, how do I know that ain't gonna bounce? Anita, I'm not intentionally gonna write you a check that will bounce. Doc, what happens to all your money? Good morning. I drove my blind brother Tommy 2000 miles on prayers to God you'd listen to his song. I'm listening. Hit it, Tommy. Listen to me, Doc. I'm talking about rent money, car payments, food, and clothes. I don't understand how I got behind in your alimony. I'll damn sure bet you ain't behind in Honey Carder's alimony. She never asked for any. Mm, Doc... You know, I think you loved me about 10 percent of the time, hated me about 10 percent of the time. I never hated you. I couldn't hate anybody. Oh, yeah? You hate Rodeo Rocky. I've never hated a real human being. When are you gonna grow up and be a responsible person? I'm president of my own publishing company, got my own studio. How grown up do I have to be? You know, I think you and I probably just got married the wrong year and a half of our lives, and I'm sorry it didn't work out. Oh, Doc. Why did I leave you? Why did I leave you? I left you. Doc, that Cajun creep is here. All right, Mulreaux, send him in. and get Hogan over here. Well, you take the ITC, you deduct all the interest. You write off your fuel and your maintenance-- I don't care about-- How much money are you talking about? Hogan, you know Mulreaux. Mulreaux, you know Hogan. Hey, Hogan. How d'you do, my friend. Chicken-fried German food to go. That was a long time ago. Uh, Doc, did you want to see me, because I need to see you too. Okay, look, write out a check to my friend Mulreaux here for $20,000. Doc, I can't do that. That's corporation funds. Rodeo Rocky just put the clamp on the Cowbird Music money. How can he do that? I'm the president of the company. HOGAN: You sold him the company. Oh, bullshit. He's just in as an investor. That's not what the contract says. You sell something to somebody, they own it. You work for him. I don't want to hear that. How about $15,000? That's the best damn news I heard all day. Here comes-- [BOTH SHOUTING] [CHUCKLES, WALKS AWAY] Doc, I wouldn't trust him as far as we could throw him. I want to know how come Anita's checks are bouncing. Well, Rodeo Rocky put a stop to the Anita situation. That son of a bitch. Well, you sold him the company! Watch me repossess it. You'd better keep both eyes on that son of a bitch, because he's crazier than you are. Uh, Doc... I want to talk to you. Yeah, well, go ahead. Get this asshole out of here. He stays. Who is he? Purvis, Lionel Purvis. He's the new comptroller for Cowbird Music. Well, you're just the prick I want to talk to. How come my checks are bouncing? You haven't been living up your contract. Who said? I do. He also turned down payment on all those vouchers for them invisible musicians in that so-called superband. Cut your expense accounts too. Yeah, he's gonna keep bouncing checks to your ex-wife until you live up to our deal. Some deal. It's more like a goddamn ambush. Hey, Doc, you live in some kind of a western fantasy. You ain't Doc Holliday. You're Doc Jenkins. I'll get you a drink. I don't want a drink. I want my goddamn contract back. How much? Hey, Doc... Remember the old days, when you and Blackie Buck first came to Nashville in that old Buick? You both slept in it. How young were we then, Doc? Oh, how much? Where are you gonna come up with that kind of money? We're talking seven figures. Don't worry about the goddamn money! Now, I'm in a new business deal. Yeah, let me guess. He's gonna raise the Titanic. Doc, you work for me. You start writing songs for me, pronto. You don't inspire me. I can't get in the mood. That contract don't say shit about mood. You work for me, Doc, or you got nothing! I mean, never mind your vouchers, your ex-wives, your invisible musicians. I'll stop the $150,000 a year I pay to keep you in golf balls. I manage Blackie Buck, and you can't do shit about that. Blackie Buck, yeah... The way he's living, his heart's gonna blow up before Halloween. You work for me, Doc! You run Cowbird Music for me. How could you use his lawyer to negotiate your contract with him? I mean, you should've known he'd own you 100%. Well, that wasn't the deal. Well, what was the deal? The deal was I'd put up the talent, he'd put up the money, we'd split 50/50. We shook on it. You shook hands on it? Doc, you didn't sign his hand, you signed a contract. That's real funny. Doc, you got cheated. He has an exclusive on you. He owns you. Do I own this building? Yeah, you do own this building, and the management contract with Blackie Buck, but that's it. * A night to remember RADIO DEEJAY: Blackie Buck returns to Austin. What'd he say? He says we're going to Austin. Where are we going? We're headed to Shreveport. Hey! MUSICIAN: You deaf, or what? Wait a minute. This guy says we're booked in the Austin Opry House. That's another Dino production. He tried to book us in there tonight, but Doc turned down the bad-paying rat son of a bitch. Well, it sounds like he ain't taking no for an answer. Yeah, well, we don't show, and that damned Dino keeps the ticket money. I'm losing my wonderful disposition, goddamn it. We'll get the blame. Yeah, if we don't show up, Dino McLeish puts the money in his pocket. I'm sick and tired of Dino McLeish. Let's go stomp his ass. Hell, let's go to Austin. RADIO: Tonight, at the Austin Opry House... Only the great Dino productions could present this fantastic country show. In a rare Austin appearance tonight, Blackie Buck and the Roarers at the Austin Opry House, 8:00 tonight. Tickets $10 at the Opry House-- Dino, what are you doing home? Hold it. I wish the vision of how beautiful y'all are could be painted on the Great Wall of China. Man, I mean that. I love you both. We're family, you know. Know what that means? Deep stuff. So, what are you doing home? I forgot something. Well, I'm glad you did. I kind of want to go hear Blackie Buck tonight. We got some problems. Blackie Buck may not show up. Besides, Buster's too dumb for nightlife. Buster's got ears, you know. He's gonna remember what you're saying, grow up, and beat the hell out of you. Say what? I said you promised. Okay. Let's go. Come on, Buster. So who's your opening act? [HARMONICA PLAYING] I'm about to make a big fool out of myself. There's nothing to be scared of. Just do it like you did in front of the mirror. Well, looks like your opening act got here, anyway. Where's Blackie Buck? I rented your hall, son. Let me worry about if Blackie shows up. Okay, chief. Dino, look... They'll love you, babe. I feel sick. You're gonna chop them down like dead limbs. Nervous... All big stars get nervous before a show. Don't you know that? I'm not a great star. They paid money to hear you. They came here to see Blackie Buck. You know it. Yeah, but they're gonna remember you, not him. [WHOOPING AND CHEERING] This little girl's shy and nervous. Thank you so much for everything. Let's give her a great big country greeting.

I've been working night and day, man. I took a couple of uppers. That's true. Put your hands out, like this. What's... What is that supposed to prove? Don't shake. This test beats lie detectors all to hell. Oh, man, you ain't gonna do that, are you? Watch me. You flinched. You crazy son of a bitch. Did he flinch? He flinched. So what? What are you packing for lunch here, Dino? Take another $500 out of there for Dino calling me an alcoholic son of a bitch. The only reason I drink so people won't think I'm a dope fiend. That's five and five. I'm putting on-- I'm putting-- I'm putting on a big concert. I got a spot for you, Blackie. This is gonna be the big one, boy. The word's out about you, hoss. You don't pay your artists. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Hi. Oh, for heaven's... Remember me? Young wetback from Brownsville? Wait a minute now. The working girl's favorite and the housewife's companion. Blackie! Hi, you. Hi, Honey. You feel just like a homecoming queen. Where's everybody else? On the bus, in the cold? HONEY: Cooper... Get in here! All right! Whoo! Where can you get something to eat around here? But, Doc, I never even thought about being a singer before. Oh, sure... You feel like a singer to me. MAN: Doc, there's a call for you. It's Blackie. He's in Austin. That's really nice. Hi, Blackie. Dino tried to do his tap dance again. We negotiated. Dino? Where are you? Excuse me. Hey, wait a minute. I want you to talk to somebody. Who's that? Say hello. Hello? Honey? Oh, hi, Doc. Uh, what are you doing there? Well, it's my house, Doc. I'm home. I live here. Honey, I've been missing you guys a lot. I'd like to come down and hang out with you a while. Listen, Doc, um... I gotta go now, okay? You take care. Hey, you still looking for that girl singer? I was just talking to the best one in the world. We just worked with one there in Austin. Man, she's clean as an angel's drawers, and her name's Gilda. Well, I was thinking about coming to Austin anyway. Wait for me. Hell, I'm always waiting for you. Y'all just make yourself at home. GILDA: * To go on Throwing good love * * After bad * Oh But the fools we've been * * Ain't nothin' like The fools we'll be * * To keep believin' dreams That don't come true * * Oh, they never do * Because, you know It's never wise * * To fall in love * To make believe * So I'll be leavin' * If it's all the same to you * Yes, I'll be leavin' * 'Cause it's all * The same to you... * Not bad at all. Yeah! GILDA: Thank you. Thank you. I told you you were crazy to sign a deal with anyone named Rodeo Rocky. Sounds like some kind of ice cream, for Christ's sake. Why don't you just quit? Leave. Let him sue you. What's he gonna get? My golf cart. Well, what else? I need that $150000 for the kids and for Honey. Which she ain't asked for. Which she ain't asked for, but nevertheless... Do you deliberately make it harder just so you can stay interested? Get yourself about an hour's sleep before Shreveport. Your voice is getting raspy. Hell, I'm working on that rasp. Makes me sound soulful. Hey, how's she doing? You ought to go see. The chick is mine. She's signed and sealed. I just want to say hello. Don't you try to steal Gilda away from me, will you? This is the ticket I've been waiting for all my life, man. Don't burn it down. Any deal you make with Gilda has got to come through me. You dig? I just want to say hello. Uh-huh. Hello? MAN: Hey, Doc. This is Doc. Where's Gilda? She's in there. Look here. It's Doc. Great show. I loved it. Gilda. Oh, thank you. You are so good. This is Arly. Thanks for coming down. A rodeo buckle? Yep. Calf roping. Can I get you something to drink? No, thanks. The regular? [STAMMERS] I don't know what it is. You don't look like her or sing like her, but there's something about you that reminds me of Honey. You're kidding. No, I'm not. Honey Carder was the first woman I ever wanted to be like. You're gonna be a greater star than Honey Carder ever was. You know that? Right to the point, Dino. I've never been wrong about a singer yet, Doc. Come on. I'm gonna check on something. Don't let Doc talk you out of your pants. Oh, that's very funny. You know, he could be right. What are you talking about? Well, not about the pants, about you being a big star some of these days. You really could. Honey Carder could really sing. Well, she still can, God bless her. So why'd she retire? Well, she got tired of traveling. Then the kids come along... and she just quit. * Write it down * What you found out * Songwriter * Don't let it all * Slip away * Speak your mind * All the time * Songwriter * Someone is listening * Today * So write on * Songwriter * Write on * Songwriter * Write on * Songwriter * Write on * Songwriter * Okay, Dino, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you the studio time and my time, and I'm not gonna charge you a producer's fee until Gilda's album has sold 100,000. Not gonna charge me a fee... Bubba, I put this band together myself. I found Gilda singing in the Pentecostal student center. Gilda, I'm gonna pay you five-- $5000 cash upfront. $5000? That's impossible. You gonna give us a million upfront. Dino ain't gonna do shit. In fact, you'll probably wind up getting screwed. He'll get robbed. I want to book you all over the country, places Dino couldn't get into with a ticket. I haven't traveled much. I feel sort of funny. I can also produce a hit album for you. Dino can't do that. No offense. I don't know if I'm ready to make an album. I'll be the judge of that. You know the big concerts you want to do? Yeah, what about it? I'll help you put it on. I'll get the talent for you, people who wouldn't normally talk to you on the telephone. What if it rains? We'll go inside. What split do you want? Fifty-fifty, after expenses. What about the t-shirts, posters, art show concessions? Same deal, 50/50. Man, I don't trust you. Gilda's worth more than one concert. She's a star. I'm not a star. Honey Carder is a star. Pull over. You sell vacuum cleaners? Yeah, they're on sale. What kind do you got? All kinds. Nice suit. Like that. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [DOOR OPENS] DOC: How do you do, ma'am? My name is Jenkins. I'm with the American Research Institute of Technology. I'm sure you're familiar with us. We own and manufacturer the beautiful and powerful Paradise vacuum cleaner. However, I would like to put your mind at ease. This has nothing to do with a normal purchase of our powerful Paradise vacuum cleaner. Could I come in to explain the program to you? Oh, hold on a minute, mister. Now, a man who looked like you came to my door years ago selling vacuum cleaners. He knocked me up. Hmm... must have been someone from our service department. Excuse me. May I come in, please? Thank you. Mm-hmm. Just as I thought. This looks like a clean rug to the normal naked eye. People think their babies can crawl on rugs like this, but wait till you see what happens when I put my little Paradise to work on it. Oh, uh-huh. That's what that salesman who looked like you said, except they sent me a different model than the one I ordered. Hi. Hi. You feel good. So do you. The kids in school? Oh, it's Saturday, Doc. They're outside playing. Oh. You've been up all night, haven't you? You want something to drink? How about some iced tea? What, you're not drinking whiskey? Not for almost a year. Oh. Blackie says you're moguling again. Blackie don't know what he's talking about. Well, you know what I'm talking about. I'm the president of my own corporation, you know. [CHUCKLES] You've been an executive of losing corporations most of your adult life, Doc. Selling your soul is one thing, but your copyrights-- how could you? It's not that simple. Yes, it is. It's that simple, and it's that wrong. Why don't you stop trying to outdo the Fortune 500 and just be what you are? Which is a poet. What about all those things... I need some help. Well, okay. Are you listening to me? What about all those dreams? Come on here... All that talk years ago about following an artistic vision, huh? Yeah, well, bankers don't really care a lot about artistic vision, and they'd just as soon not talk to poets anyway. Oh, the bankers. Yeah, well, the bankers own all the art and the artists. They don't think about anything but money. You ought to be writing, Doc. I am writing. As much as you're partying? I bet your living room still looks like Elvis' wedding reception. Don't tell me you can do any writing with all them weirdos and freeloaders hanging around. It is not possible. I bet you haven't picked up a guitar and written a song in so long you've forgotten how to. Come here. And, on your way by, if you could help me pick up the guitar... That always was the hardest part. Thank you. Would you have a seat, please? Set down for me. * A past that's sprinkled * With the blues * A few old dreams * That I can't use * Who'll buy my memories * Of things that used to be? * There were the smiles Before the tears * * And with the smiles * Some better years * Who'll buy my memories * Of things that used to be? * When I remember How things were * * My memories All lead to her * * I'd like to start My life anew * * But memories * Just make me blue * A cottage small * Just built for two * A garden wall Of violets blue * * Who'll buy my memories * Of things that used to be? * Who'll buy my memories * Of things that used to be? * You showoff. Come over here with me. What do you want from me, Doc? Well, there's not a day goes by that I don't miss you. I make pretty speeches in my head to you all the time. I should have thrown my body across the door and kept you from leaving me. Come home with me. You're a hard act to follow, Doc. God love you for being such a dreamer, but you leave me out. I love you. But I can't live with you. If you ever get tired of all the partying, me and the girls are here. Come home with me, and I'll give you anything you want. Will you really, Doc? [DOOR OPENS] GIRL: I want Coke. GIRL #2: I want orange juice. I want Coke. Coke. Hey! [BOTH SQUEALING] Daddy! How are you doing? Well, you're growing so much! I got something for you. This one's yours. This one's yours. Thank you. Oh, it's pretty. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. You're welcome. How's your music, angel? Good. I'll get my guitar. [***] Hey, you're Doc Jenkins! Yeah. Where to? Eastern Airlines. Can't you find some way to get back to Austin? We sure do miss you, Doc. Yeah, I've been thinking about that. [TELEPHONE RINGS] I'm looking for that phone. Excuse me. [PHONE RINGS] Fantasy Island. Darling... Excuse me. Hey, will you guys shut up? I think this is Doc. Doc, where are you? I want you to go rent a U-Haul truck, pack all my stuff, and drive to Austin. Drive to Austin? Don't tell the whole world about it, and call me when you get there, at the Lakeway Ramada. Got that? The Lakeway. The Lakeway Ramada... Doc, you can count on me. Hello? Hello, Hogan? Doc, is that you? Do you know what time it is? Yeah, I know what time it is. Are you sure I own the Cowbird Music building? Yes, you own the Cowbird Music building. [SIREN WAILS] HOGAN: Hello? DOC: Hogan, we did have insurance, didn't we? Hey, boss, you ain't gonna believe this. "Fire destroyed Cowbird Music." What? "Fire destroyed Cowbird Music. What! "Fire destroyed Cowbird Music. No one was harmed in the blaze." Shit! DOC: * You're callin' us heathens * With zero respect For the law * * But we're only songwriters * * Just writing our songs And that's all * * We write what we live * And we live what we write * Is that wrong? * Well, if you think it is * Mr. Music Executive * Why don't you Write your own song? * * Mr. Purified Country * Don't you know what The whole thing's about? * * Is your head up your ass So far * * That you can't pull it out? * The world's gettin' smaller * And everyone in it Belongs * * If you can't see that * Mr. Music Executive * Why don't you Write your own songs? ** Hey, I want the sign up by this afternoon, you understand? I want it hanging there, and I don't want any wind blowing it down, or it's gonna be real ugly if it falls down. It's gonna be ugly for you, it's gonna be ugly for me. Hi. Oh, hi, Doc. Doc, this is it. This is it. How do you like the new sign? It's the right state. Oh, no. Look. Just leave the stuff here. I'm going to take care of this myself. What I need is all of the furniture-- That chair, just leave it there, because I'm gonna do Doc's office myself. Doc, hi! Looks great. Where's my office at? Oh, it's right around here. Uh, Doc, I'm afraid we have one small problem. You got the loan? That went through fine. What's the matter? No, it's about the telegram that you got today. Who from? It was from Rodeo Rocky. He says he's gonna break your knees and poke out your eyes. Well, all right for ol' Rodeo. This is a nice place. Where can I hide this? Hide what? Doc, I seriously think this guy's mad enough to kill you. What you need to do is just give him a couple of songs. That's the first place he's gonna look, is right there. What? Doc! I'm really scared of this guy. He is crazy. He's liable to come in here and do anything. [TELEPHONE RINGS] That man is a gangster. Lone Star music. Hi! Yeah. Yeah, Doc's here. Hey, Doc, it's Blackie. Is there something weird going on there that I should know about? How soon can you get out here? What the hell is Lone Star Music? I'll tell you when you get here. Playing hell with my schedule. Blackie, I need you. [HANGS UP PHONE] Just relax a minute there, darling. Blackie... Where are you going? Blackie... You good-looking son of a bitch. Don't you never die. Everything's off the truck. I'm all finished. No, you ain't. Take this somewhere and hide it, and shoot the first son of a bitch that touches it, okay? And get Gilda on the phone for me, please. I've got her number in my office. I love show business. I can't take money for something I didn't write. I don't think you should. Actually, you should take the credit, I'll take the royalties. I can't put my name on your song. Strange part of it is I can't either. Why? It's a business technicality. Oh. I don't want to get into all this business stuff. I just like to sing. I think you should, because you're the singer, but this is the kind of song that could take you across all boundaries and make a superstar out of you all over the world. Could you get me some of those doughnuts over there, please? Yeah. Is it a ballad? One of the prettiest-- I don't do ballads. We'll bring it up to the kind of stuff that you like to do... like, uh, what would you sing? I don't know, "Great Balls of Fire"? Start it there and bring it down just a little bit. What do you think? Maybe. [GRUMBLING] Lone Star, my dick. Doc isn't here right now. I hate Texas. You know, Doc, we would have been great rich gentlemen-- OFFICE ASSISTANT: Ow! [FOOTSTEPS] All right, Doc, now I'm going to burn you. Get out of here! Can I get anybody a coffee? Yeah. Black. Black? Black, Corkie. Black? Black. Oh, Black. Out! DOC: Real black. Lose your horse? This ain't old "Rodeo Rocky." This is Marvin Rapshut from the streets of Chicago. And I don't let no hick like you knock down what I've fought my whole life to build up! You owe me, Doc! You owe me and my associates at least six albums-- seven years of your songwriting. I don't care what name you put on your music company. Lone Star, Lone Ranger... bullshit! That fire did nothing but burn equipment. I hope your associates hang you to a light pole. You keep messing with me, you're gonna end up with nothing but a little spot where you're standing. You're in deep shit! You're a great songwriter! You're a genius! What'd you write for me? Nothing! One song! What happened? Something, "Tra-la-la-la!" Something? Nothing! Seven goddamn years! Prick didn't write nothing! [DOOR BANGS OPEN] Hold it right there. Put that down! Put it down! Easy! Rocky, have you ever heard of the O.K. Corral? Don't want no violence here. Is that the kind of coffee you meant, Doc? Let's be civilized. Say hello to the president of Lone Star Music, Mr. Blackie Buck. What? [SLAPS BLACKIE] There ain't no more Cowbird Music, and my and your contract is through. Yeah, and I'm Marie Osmond. I'm not just talking to one of your shit-kicking friends, Jenkins. Did you ever hear of a legal injunction? I'll have you closed down within 60 days. Come on. You've been smoking your running socks again, haven't you? Be serious. You gotta help me on this. You got to front this company for me, or else I ain't got no income at all. Jesus, Doc. I really got a handle on it this time. You always had a handle on it. What the hell is wrong with you? Nothing a million dollars won't fix. DOC: Listen, you never even have to come in to the company. BLACKIE: You think that's gonna stop that injunction? What choice have I got? Besides, it's already bought us 60 days. Come on inside. Come here, I want to show you something. You're treating yourself real good for a bankrupt man. This ain't my house. This is your house. I live in Nashville. Rent's paid up for six months... Prez. I'm not your prez. What are you up to? How'd you pull this off? Well, it was a short-term loan on a long-term lie. It's called high finance. It's called bull squash. Look out here. I don't care what's out there. Ta-dah! [LAUGHING] You asshole. You rent me a new backswing too? Get in. I'll take you for a ride. Hey, pal, I want the president of Lone Star Music to work a few places around here in Austin, where he's already big, and then I want him to go out on the road as a superstar. Not alone, but with an opening act, and I'm gonna groom Gilda for that one. Why? Because I got cheated, and I want to get even. * Losers can't believe * In anything at all * Hey But never mind-- ** What's the matter? [MUSIC STOPS PLAYING] I can't get it right. I can't. I just can't get it right. I'll come in there. What's wrong? My voice cracked, and it just didn't sound pretty. No, it sounded great. Let me sing harmony with you for the bridge, and I think I can help you with that phrasing part on the bridge. Would you run it again from the bridge, Larry? [MUSIC BEGINS] * Think of all the love We made us * * Since you used To be afraid of * * Staring at Those starry skies * * Above our lives * Now you're free to * Be the best That you can be now * * Come here to eternity * Love me * Forever [GIGGLES] * In your love * That was great. All right. Let's record it. Okay. We'll do that. From the top. Hi, Blackie. Doc wanted me to drop this by. What time is it? Did I wake you up? Not yet. Oh. Here. What is it? It's Gilda's new song, I think. I'm sorry I bothered you. Hey, listen, you can bother me any time you want to. Bye. Bye? How you doing, Blackie? Hey. Doc's feeling a little down tonight. Well, this'll cheer him right up. I need to talk to you. What about? Well, I listened to that tape of Gilda's new song. Oh, yeah? What do you think? I think she's a shitty songwriter. Oh, yeah? We do need to talk. Why are you asking Gilda to put her name on your songs? Because I can't put my name on it. Rodeo Rocky would get all the money. Why didn't you ask me? Because you're a songwriter. That's the answer? That girl's never written anything in her life. It's okay for people like that, who can't write, to say they wrote something they didn't write. They do that all the time, but you're a songwriter, and you can't say you wrote something you didn't write unless you really wrote it. Say that again. I can't. You're getting real strange, Doc. If I put my name on one of your songs, it would screw Rodeo Rocky, providing you got another one that as good as the one you gave Gilda. Say that again. I can't. You're getting real strange, Blackie. I'd put my name on one of your songs, long as it would screw Rodeo Rocky, as long as it was as good as the one you gave Gilda. Say that again. I can't. You're getting real strange, Doc. I'd put my name on one of your songs if it it would screw Rodeo Rocky, providing you got another one as good as the one you gave Gilda. You got a deal. GILDA AND BLACKIE: * And we can make love be * The kind of mystery * And, baby, you and I * Will be making true love * Lying soul to soul * Inside a hideaway * And we can make it be The kind of mystery ** Hot damn, Doc, I should've known it was you by the way the spit squished. How's it going? Good, how you doing, Samuel? Good, pretty good. You still take payola? You bet. Payola ain't dead around here. Ain't even sick. You know, I've been pushing old Blackie so hard, I'm about to get a hernia. This is Gilda's first record. Would you play it? Oh, yeah, we'll play it right after this. What's on there now? The Geezinslaws. You know, I've known Gilda since the day she hit Austin, and this is the first I ever knew that she was a songwriter. Says here she wrote that one. See? You learn something every day. You certainly do. I think I like it already, Doc, you rascal. The more you play it, the more you'll like it. Well, let's play it. Hey, talk about one that's breaking hot. Here you go. Sweeping the country like a brand-new broom, sung and written by Gilda, "Forever in Your Love." Take it away, girl. [SONG BEGINS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello? Hello? Turn on KVET. GILDA ON RADIO: * Dreamers * Make-believe in... All right! Oh, my God! * ...To last forever Oh, God! * Losers can't believe-- This is great! Hey, Doc! * Anything at all... Thanks, Doc! That's okay. That's why I get 90 percent, sugar. You take the credit, and I'll take the money. * But don't be sorry * Think of all the love We made... * I don't care if the wheels of justice turn slowly. Twist them. No, I own him. I want him shut down. * Now you're free to * Be the best That you can be now... * You know, she writes pretty good. Better than Doc Jenkins. Oh, shit. Rodeo Rocky called again. Does he have anything new to say? No, it's the same message. Yeah, I know, if he finds me, I'm dead. Torture first. See you later, Doc. Okay, Corkie. [***] [CROWD CHEERING] BLACKIE AND GILDA: * Hey * Take it and run, child Good morning. Hi. How you doing? I'm all right. Look here. See right there? Number 15, "Forever in Your Love." Gilda. That's 15 in the whole wide world. Oh, God. Look... Uh, you produced it, you arranged it, you hustled it... All I did was sing it. And sang the shit out of it too. Now, that says "Gilda" right there. That don't say "Doc." Sooner or later, I'm gonna cause some trouble for you, I think. Nah. [***] GILDA: * The heavens above me * Seem empty and green * As dreams * That will never come true * The star-spangled glory * Of love * Fill the sky * And my heart * With the wonder of you Sixth card... "Spiritual masters from higher realms reveal the true nature of God in the cosmos." That's pretty good. You know, I think it was Camus who said, "Truth is secondary to existence." Camus, the jungle boy? DINO: I was only 13 years old, but I cried... BAND MEMBER: Over a sheep? What'd he say? Something about a damn sheep. Nine times out of 10, you know, they think people start this, but sheep is good, and they know it. They'll flirt with you. Don't think they won't. Hey, Dino, your old lady says you ain't half ba-a-a-a-ad. Just remember something: the older the ram, the stiffer the horn. [***] When I first heard Gilda sing, I said to myself, "Dino, this chick's a natural. "All she needs is guidance from you, and a good producer." So naturally, man, I called Doc Jenkins. BLACKIE: Hey. Yeah? Where the hell is Sam? Don't know, boss. Ain't seen him since the hotel this morning. He's probably back there making a house call. Where's Doc? He's got the wheels. I got locked out of my room. Could I use your pass key, just for a minute? I'll bring it right back to you. Thank you. [WOMAN GIGGLING, MOANING] Dino... Dino? Oh, shit. Hi. Here you go, sweetheart. Listen, I can explain. Now, Dino, she told me that y'all had a "plutonic" relationship. Take a right here. It wasn't exactly entirely all my fault. Stop right there. Better me than some asshole. Take a swig. Put that right on top of your head. Fixing to kill Sam? Just trying to see whether my nerves are under control. I'm afraid you stepped in it this time, boy. Doc, can you talk to him, the crazy son of a bitch? I expect this'll be a good lesson for you. [SIGHS] Fuck... I underestimated you, Dino. All you son o' bitches do. BLACKIE: Anyway, this is the song. We're gonna do it for Dino. [CROWD CHEERS] * For a lady who learned * All there is about livin' * She sure picked A hard way to go * * But he loved her * Right down to her socks * And no further * And her feet were * The last ones to know * DEEJAY: This week's number 12 is moving like a rocket: "Forever in Your Love" by Gilda. Hey, we're number 12! Gilda, we're number 12! Did you hear that? Congratulations, Doc! Congratulations to you too, Gilda. I mean it. I'm really happy. I'm happy for you. Turn it up. Can you hear it? How about a raise? Number 12. You been that high before? Once. Wish them injunctions would get here. Yeah, we got the injunction. When? Last week. Well, why the hell didn't we serve him? You're good with numbers, Lionel. What would you rather have, 100 percent of nothing, or 100 percent of two platinum albums? What do you mean by that? That song that Gilda wrote? Doc wrote it. And the song that Blackie wrote, he wrote that one too, and he's writing a lot more, and he don't think I know it. We're gonna let that injunction earn a little interest before we slap him with it. He's making us a lot of money. A lot of money. BLACKIE: * Make a rule * One by one * With their lies * Raisin' the danger * Of their king * Lord, under the gun * No more time * No more chances * No more war * Will be won * In the end * Only the losers * Hold the land * Under the gun * Hold the truth * Hold the truth * Like a candle * Like a candle * Let it shine * Let it shine * Like the sun * Like the sun * All the love * All the love * That's left to believe in * In a world * World * Under the gun * Break a man * Break a promise * Break a promise * Break a heart * Heart * Break a home * Break a home * Take a long... * Hard look at heaven * Gone to hell * Under the gun * Okay, y'all go home now. God bless you. [BAND PLAYS INSTRUMENTALS] It's just... Wait. I just want you to listen to this. I got the auditorium on a four-wall deal, only had to give them 20 percent on it. Only had to give them 20 percent on the concessions. Doc, they could've screwed us real bad on that. They're gonna sell everything-- belt buckles, binoculars, caps, t-shirts, piss-warm beer, picture programs, popcorn, peanuts... The whole shootin' match. We don't have to do nothing, just take the money and run. Dino, you'd better take a nap. You been up since Korea. Yeah, that's because I stay up 25 hours every day keeping my eyes on you sons o' bitches. The way you piss away money is phenomenal. You promotin' that Gilda, spendin' so goddamned much money, how are you gonna break even? Let me tell you about Gilda. She's number one in the whole world. Check that out. Whoo! Doc, that Cajun creep is on the phone again. Tell him I went to a weaver's convention in Itasca, Texas. Hey, Doc, I'm gonna tell you something. Listen, I used to hate you for it, but I'm glad you took Gilda on. Dig it, Doc. It's a classic. We put all our chips on a hysterical neurotic drunk woman, and she's gonna make us rich... Or dead. Have you seen where Blackie is on the charts? Number three! Hey! Right behind Gilda. [GUITAR STRUMMING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Who is it? GILDA: Telegram. Shit. [KNOCKING CONTINUES] I'm coming. How'd you find me? Well, I went by your house, and, uh... Ralph told me. So... Whatcha hiding from, anyway? Well, I was trying to write some songs, and it's not that easy with all the partying going on. Sure wish you were into some hard, nasty drinking. We could be the same kind of idiots tonight. Look... I don't-- I can't say I'm a songwriter... I'm not a songwriter. I just don't want to do it anymore. I don't want to say I'm a songwriter. I don't write songs. Maybe I'm not a mogul, either. Then it's all a game. Come here. Come on. Come on... When I was in fifth grade, there were always a couple of cute guys... a brainy guy... a tough guy... And then there was... the guy that everybody thought was... "the guy." There was always the skinny little girl in the ballerina slippers too. Why don't you ever tell me not to get drunk on stage? Everybody else does. Dino does, Arly does... I think everybody has to kill their own snakes. Speaking of... Where is Arly? The trouble with Arly is... I'm in love with you. Oh, no! No, Doc, really. Now, come on, I take love serious. I do too. Really, Doc. You'd better go home, Gilda. No. Not tonight. You'd really better go home. Not tonight. No. [PHONE RINGS] No, don't answer it. Don't get it. Don't, Doc, don't. Hello. Don't... Hello? Come on. Oh, hi, Honey! Honey, you remember Gilda, that new girl singer I was telling you about? Gilda, Honey says tell you "hi." The one that sang so great? Yeah, she's over here. We're just having a couple of drinks. God, I wish you was here. I miss you a lot. How are the kids doing? Straight A's! They got straight A's in school, Gilda. Bye. [DOOR CLOSES] No, Blackie, I'm not losing it. Why don't you come over here and help me finish this song? Maybe you can screw me out of half of it before it's over with. And I'll explain everything to you then. Do you suppose a man's got to be a miserable son of a bitch all the time just to write a good song every now and then? That's a terrible thought. * But from here to the end Is what matters, my friend * * And you're right At the peak of your form * You old bandit. * Still in * The eye of the storm * Right on, man. [TELEPHONE RINGS] * 'Cause from here To the end * * Is what matters My friend... * Hello. What's up? Man, we got to go. Gilda OD'd. [WATER SPLASHING] HONEY: Come on. Come on, get up. Oh, good. Help me. She came over here to apologize for trying to seduce you, and telling me what a saint you are... She passed out while she was still talking, she had the pill bottle in her hand. Oh, I'm sorry. All right, now, y'all go on out. Let me get her out of these cold clothes so she doesn't get pneumonia. [GILDA WHIMPERING AND MUMBLING] Go on out. It's okay, baby. Hey, you two. Daddy, what's happening? You come with me here. [CRYING] Gilda... Come on, honey. Try to drink some of this. It's hot. Be careful. Just take a little sip. Okay? Is that good? You're supposed to break their hearts, darling. They're not supposed to break yours. [SOBBING] Gilda's gonna be okay. You and Blackie go on home now. We got a lot to talk about, Gilda and me. Goodbye. Bye, Honey. Bye. [LOUD MUSIC PLAYING IN HOUSE] Can I have your attention, please? I hate to break up a great party, but it's little late, and I'm real tired, and I'd like to ask everybody to knock it off and please go home, if you will? Thank you very much. [GUESTS MURMURING] Thank you. Appreciate it. Catch you later. Good night, everybody. Take care, Doc. Thanks a lot. Good night. Thank you. Happy birthday, buddy. Thanks, Doc. Good night, Doc. Good night. Good night. See you again. Good night. Good night, Doc. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. Bye. Thanks. [STRUMS A SLOW TUNE] Hi. I just came by to tell you that the party is over at my house. I asked everybody to go home. And, uh... the house is empty. Real empty. I don't want you to say anything. I just wanted to tell you that. BLACKIE: * Thank God You still got your feelings * * And you're free To be easy and warm * * 'Cause from here to the end * * Is what matters, my friend * You're right At the peak of your form * You old bandit. * Still in The eye of the storm ** Well, look who's-- Look who's here. God, you're looking good too. Oh. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. How are you, Doc? Good, good. Well, we drove up to Kingfisher and got married by Gilda's granddaddy. Well, congratulations! Oh! I think that's fantastic. Thank you. There's something else we got to tell you. You probably ain't gonna like it. You'd better tell him. While we were in Kingfisher... Ain't, uh... ain't justice wonderful, Doc? I mean, it's slow, but it sure does work. You are closed, and you owe me every dollar, and the songs you wrote for Blackie and the songs you wrote for Gilda. I guess you got me. DOC: I know when I'm licked. I must be getting old and tired. Dropped a step somewhere. I'm man enough to admit it when I'm whipped, and you always were stronger than me, even back in Nashville, in the old days. Have a drink. Humility is a quality which becomes you, Doc. Yeah, I've been thinking about slowing down a little bit. I think you are rapidly approaching wisdom. I think it's the music industry, the concerts. Gilda's getting so big. I just can't handle it all. Besides, you deserve all that anyway. How much? Two million, cash. Was the ground cold this morning, Doc? I mean, you want blood, find somebody else's neck, not mine. I risked my life in the Nashville fire to saved this tape of the Eleven Dixie Mudcats, the supergroup. They're all yours. I want your management contract with Blackie Buck. Mm-mm. No way. I want my songwriter's contract back too. What good is that? I'm not writing songs. Gilda, she's not worth that much. She's worth more than $2 million to a good manager like you. I mean, you squeeze one number-one single out of her, and she's a star. I mean, I hear she's a bad drunk and a doper. Well, why don't you go meet her and see if she's a bad drunk and a doper? Go to the concert. If she is, we'll go back to my old shitty contract. But wait till you meet her to make that decision. Maybe I could come up with $1 million. Two million is stealing from me. You always been pretty good at that. One million, one million, and you throw in Blackie. Well, you got me in a trap. I'm gonna take the million for Gilda and the rest, but I'm keeping Blackie. All right, bring her backstage, tomorrow night, 8:00. You bring me the money, just like I like it-- all cash. Yeah. Put it in water. It may explode. BLACKIE: * We used to talk About the rock 'n' roll * * Made it matter Not to sell your soul * * Like a banner That we held so high * * We weren't afraid to fall * Instead we rolled into The wanted sign * * That put heaven In between the lines * * That kept us rockin' Till the break of day * * Or any break at all * We used to take 'em * By the day and the night * Try to steal 'em Without a soul in sight * There you go. Hey, man, that's the wrong pass. They changed it. What do you mean, they changed it? I'm "they"-- I'm Dino McLeish. I'm your boss, son. Rodeo Rocky's my boss, asshole. Oh, Rocky. Listen, I've got this tape... [MUSIC CONTINUES] Now who's the asshole? * We could do no wrong * We'll never be The same again * * But the show goes on * [BAND PLAYS INSTRUMENTAL] [***] Thank you! What do you say, Rocky? How are you doing? What are you gonna do with it if you get it, Doc? I'm gonna sit up on a mountaintop somewhere. You are a hick, Doc, really a hick, but I've got a warm spot in my heart for you. I mean, we've known each other for a long time. Yeah, you always were sentimental, when you had your hand in my pocket. * See the light * We had to leave behind It is five after 8. Where is Gilda? She'll be here. Let me hold that for you. Must be getting a little heavy, huh, Rocky? Oh, there she is. Right there. Come on over. I'll introduce you. Oh, thank you. Hi there. How're you doing, Gilda? This is Rodeo Rocky. This is Gilda. Arly, how are you? I've heard a lot about you... but you seem to be a nice man anyhow. Well, I'm am a nice man... anyhow. You have a positive sort of aura. I do? [SNIFFING] You ain't been drinking? No. I don't drink anymore. You don't drink? Hi. I'm Arly. This is Arly. Yeah. Well, it was lovely meeting you, Mr. Rocky. Call me Rodeo. Rodeo. Yeah. ARLY: Would you excuse us, please? Congratulations. Thank you. Come on, darling. Excuse me. Well, what do you think? She's sweet, Doc. She's sweet, and my gut feeling is she's honest. Right. Sweet, honest girl. All right, you stick around, because the best is yet to come. My own lawyer looked at this one. You got my songwriter's contract there? Thank you very much. You got the money? Yeah, give him the money. Give me the money. Thank you. You know something, Doc? What's that? I think I got myself a new star. You just might. You just might. Big one. Real big. See you in Waco. We got him. So that's the white hat, huh? What are you doing up there, deer hunting? Something like that. Well, good luck. You're taking off, aren't you, hoss? Yeah. And you finally got him. We got him. We did it. Well, I love you, Doc. I love you too. God bless you. We'll have to have lunch sometime. Let's do that. Hey, Doc, here's that tape that you wanted. Bye, Corkie. See you later. Thanks for the warning. Hi, Blackie. Hi, Blackie. Hi, Blackie. Hi, Blackie. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] And now, ladies and gentlemen, the hottest act in country music, Gilda! [CROWD ROARS] Thank you... Thank you. We didn't know whether to tell you this, but our good friend, Doc Jenkins, said we should. Arly and I got married a couple of days ago. [WILD CHEERING] Well, I think that's real nice, boss, don't you? We have found something stronger than everything. Something more satisfying than anything. And as a result of this, we have decided we won't be performing any more country or rock 'n' roll. We have joined the Pentecostal church... And we will be doing only gospel music from now on. Doc says those disappointed can get your money back at the box office. [THUD] Sing along with us in joy and celebration. * There's a church In the valley * * By the wildwood * No lovelier spot In the dale * * No place is so dear * To my childhood I'm making a collection for Rodeo Rocky. Here's my authorization right here. Just give me half. Go on, now. Keep going. Come on. Get on the floor. Get on the floor. Hey, Rocky Shit Detail Man, what are you listening to? I'm listening to Chopin, asshole. Well, listen to that, asshole. Too much bass? Tell Rocky I wrote it just for him. * Come, come, come, come * Come to the church In the wildwood * * Oh, come to the church In the vale * [GILDA'S SONG CONTINUES] How much did you get? I did pretty good. You got robbed. There's a lot of that going on. How many tickets did you sell? Seven thousand two hundred. Building holds five. Well, shit, bubba, airlines do that all the time. Boss? What happened to him? I don't know. He just blacked out. This will make him feel better: a song Doc Jenkins wrote for him. DOC: * Write it down * What you found out * Songwriter * Don't let it all * Slip away * Speak your mind * All the time * Songwriter * Someone is listening * Today * So write on * Songwriter * Write on * Songwriter * Write on * Songwriter * Write on * Songwriter [***] * So write on * Songwriter * Write on * Songwriter * Write on * Songwriter * Write on * Songwriter *
