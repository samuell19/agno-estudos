This is one week's work for the average American housewife, 42 beds to make, 863 dishes to wash, and an open-faced peanut butter and jelly that fell gooey side down. (audience laughing) But listen, before we continue, all you guys out there watching the show, would you do me a great big favor, please? Would you go out into the kitchen where your wife is still up to her elbows doing the dinner dishes and bring her into the living room so that she can watch the show, too? Would you do that for me, huh?

(light orchestral music) - I hope that you don't mind I started without you. Tonight, we'd sorta like to get the record straight on the subject of housewives. There's an awful lotta wrong ideas about what a housewife really is and what she really does. For example, ask any husband, and he'll probably say this.

Terrific, okay, honey, bye-bye, bye. I better check that off before I forget. The calendar's a very, very important part of a housewife's life, you know, and oh, gee, this week is filling up already, and today's only Monday! (audience laughs) Monday, that's the toughest day for a housewife because it's the beginning of a long, long week. And that's when she sometimes wonders, did she marry the right guy? Now, come on, admit it. Haven't you ever wondered what it would've been like if you'd married one of those guys you used to date back in high school? You know, like the guy who wrote in your yearbook, "Yours till Niagara falls"? (audience laughs) Or maybe the, uh, captain of the football team or the best dancer, you know, the one who could dip?

(audience laughs) - Michael, can we go to that wonderfully expensive new French restaurant? - Of course we could go, if it weren't for my ulcer. (clears throat) - Then Michael, maybe we can go to Europe. - Of course we could, as soon as the dollar bounces back. But don't pack your bags. (audience laughs) - Maybe, Michael, we could just spend the evening alone together. - Of course we could. As soon as I get the time. You know, corporations need attention and care. - But what about me? - Why don't we discuss that next week? Hey, I'm afraid your time is up, and I've got another appointment waiting. - Appointment! You mean I can only see you by appointment and then for just one half-hour? - Well, it was either that or cancel the kids' appointment altogether.

My trick knee! Don't you remember when Kowalczyk tackled me in a homecoming game? - Oh, yeah, Danny. I'm sorry, I forgot. (chuckles) Well, maybe we could have a candlelight dinner? - Ow, my bursitis! (audience laughs) - Oh, dear, Danny, I'm, well, listen, Danny, I thought maybe after dinner, uh, we could have a little brandy. - Yeah? - And a little coffee. - Yeah! - And then maybe I might slip into something more comfortable. Huh? - Yeah! - Oh, my back, my, you know it's never been same since I pressed that 200 pounds! - Yeah, yeah, Danny, I forgot. - Oh, but go ahead, honey.

In high school, you were the smartest boy I went with. - Honey, don't you mean to say I was the smartest boy with whom you went? - Oh, yeah, well, anyway, Mark, you've made me as happy as a lark. - Honey, happy as a lark is a rather hackneyed and overused simile. (audience laughs) Would it be better to simply say that you are happy? Larks, by the way, have no ability to show emotion. Now, had you said a hummingbird- - Well, irregardless, I just love you. - Oh, honey, about irregardless, there is no such word. That's a double negative. Uh, it would be more appropriate to say nevertheless, or better still, notwithstanding. - Oh, I don't care how I say it. I'm just crazy about you! - (chuckles) Honey, crazy about you is a misdirected colloquialism. Now, that isn't what you meant to say, is it? - You're right, Mark. - I know. (audience laughs) - What I mean to say is that I am departing, and I never, ever wish to see you again, you creep. (audience laughs) - Not bad!

But Dottie's also practical. There's the antidote for it. (audience laughs) And she's sentimental, too. Ted Junior's self-portrait in finger paints. He's 19.

After we'd been married 10 years, we'd walk in the door, and my wife would head straight for some guy whose wife didn't understand him, and again, I wouldn't see her until it was time to leave. (audience laughs) Now we've been married 15 years, and these days, all they talk about at parties is who got divorced and who caused it. And you know something? My wife never leaves my side.

I feel better now than I did when I was 20. - Really? Oh, and how's your eyesight? - Well, a wee bit farsighted. You know how it is? - (laughs) I certainly do! You've been eating off my plate. (audience laughs) - You know, my husband and I have been reading this great new book called "Open Marriage," and it's just changed our lives. - Huh. - I mean, we're not smothering each other anymore. There's no jealousy. - Uh-huh. - You know, I just read this chapter that said that I could leave the party with you right now and go walking barefoot on the beach, or- - Yeah? - Go back to my place for a nightcap. - Yeah? - Or go dancing cheek to cheek in the dark. - Yeah? - And it would be okay. - And your husband goes along with all this? - I don't know, he hasn't read that chapter yet.

He took a little off, yeah? - Yeah, we were, we were on vacation in Honolulu, and he really watched himself something. - Lois, I, uh, I've been wanting to be alone with you all evening. - (laughing) Oh, Syd. You shouldn't say such things! - No, I mean it, I, I haven't been able to take my eyes off you since I first walked in that door! - (laughs) Oh, Syd! You're just terrible. - I can't help it, Lois. I have this urge to, to touch you! - Now, now, now, now, wait a minute, Syd. Remember, I'm a very happily married woman. And besides (chuckles), Phil's in the other room.

We've had a lotta fun paying tribute to the American housewife, and we meant every single word of it. Well, we did kid around a little bit, but housewives do have a sense of humor. We have to, to survive. (audience laughing) Good night. (audience applauding) (upbeat music) (lively music) (audience applauding) (lively music continues)
