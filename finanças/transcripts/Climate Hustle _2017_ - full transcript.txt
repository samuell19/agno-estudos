here is the takeaway unless the world changes course quickly and drama dramatically the fundamental systems that support human civilization are at risk we're likely to see hundreds of millions of what we'll call environmental refugees as coastal communities like this one are at risk and in the worst case scenario could disappear altogether in the coming centuries new york could be abandoned its famous landmarks lost to the sea boston philadelphia washington miami they would all be underwater that if the sea level rise occurred fast enough some major cities might have to be abandoned like for instance london this is about life or death it is a planetary emergency there is widespread scientific agreement that this is the most immediate threat to life as we know it do you ever wonder how global warming became such an enormous crisis does it demand an immediate solution hi i'm mark morano and i certainly don't want to see parts of planet earth submerged beneath the oceans or destroyed by horrific weather events and i don't imagine you do either but it all does seem a bit rushed doesn't it we repeatedly hear that the time for debate is passed the debate is over or so we're told 97 agree that climate change is real yeah we've heard that too the activists tell us we must act now or else time is growing very very short president obama is the last president with a chance so if it feels as though you're being rushed maybe you are prominent scientists from around the world reject claims of a climate catastrophe in fact growing numbers of experts see the whole issue as a sleight of hand a climate hustle this is the con game known as three card monty the dealer pressures the mark the person he hopes to fool into playing his game it's a simple game of deception designed to lure a person into thinking he can predict which of the three cards is the queen of hearts only the mark never wins the flim-flam man knows this and takes his money when the people pushing to get you into the game the ones who are predicting a calamitous future due to global warming don't show their cards it is a hustle they tell us we need to get rid of the fuels that power our homes and cars and factories and cities and economies the global warming fears have led to the government regulating our light bulbs and thermostats and vehicles and now there are even proposals for carbon ration budgets for every man woman and child on the planet open up or we'll bust it energy police we're here to check out your power consumption oh look at this a microwave hey plasma tv extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence yet climate activists claim the debate is over that no scientists disagree and that we face a certain calamity unless we act now before it's too late these are the hallmarks of a hustle in this film we're going to show you all the cards you'll hear from scientists from prestigious institutions worldwide including nasa princeton the university of london georgia institute of technology university of pennsylvania and many more some have won nobel prizes and many are former or current u.n climate panel scientists who have now turned on the un you'll see all of the cards and we'll let you decide for yourself if they are playing it straight or if you are being hustled global warming has many claims but one of the most persistent is that 97 of scientists all agree between 95 and 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is happening now 97 of experts say this three percent say that and conservatives are saying i'm gonna go with the three percent that's not conservative that's trotskyite radical um i'm an ap environmental science teacher so i teach high school environmental science and yes we like to tell our students that the majority of science all of them in fact do agree i wanted to have it smart scientists 10 out of 10 smart scientists agree if we'd had this interview mark 10 years ago i would have said i've never thought about climate i assume all the scientists who are reporting and telling the president and the prime minister of england are right i didn't have any reason not to accept the judgment of my colleagues you know the consensus and the whole ipcc process and you know i bought into it you know don't trust what one scientist says trust what these hundreds thousands of international scientists have come up with with years of deliberation when somebody asked me eight or ten years ago what's causing global warming i said well i guess there's carbon dioxide that's all i've ever heard any wisps of doubt that human activities are at fault are now gone with the wind so i bought into that and supported the consensus you think it's global warfare yes yes that's do you james yeah we're unanimous we all think it's global warming science does not function by consensus and most certainly not by politically driven consensus in fact the history of consensus in science is terrible from galileo right the way through the beginning of the 20th century 95 percent of scientists for goodness sake believed in eugenics science has to by its very nature be skeptical so basically what you get is you get hundreds of scientists to just repeat what they've heard you know in the medical community it might have been years ago you know all medical experts all doctors agreed that stomach ulcers were caused by you know stress and spicy food professor william schlesinger who served as a un climate panel lead author freely admits that very few un scientists are climate experts there's actually a huge range of different disciplines represented there i i i'm gonna have to give you a guess um that something on the order of 20 have some dealing with climate the fact that there are people sort of who are nominally there does not really mean that they support what is going on i mean working group two was essentially run by a small clique of people automatically a small group forms ahead that runs the thing and unfortunately those those that small group i would think are not the most representative or the most balanced or the most unbiased of people at 100 scientists 97 agree that climate change is real at this point who's refusing to accept the science well i guess we could agree to disagree that's a marketing that's an advertising ploy i don't think it means anything i don't think 97 percent of people who look at the climate data critically share the opinion that anthropogenic emissions of co2 is a primary driver of climate the 97 estimate is bandied about by basically everybody i had a close look at what this study really did as far as i can see this estimate just crumbles when you touch it none of the statements in the papers is supported by any data that is actually in the paper but it's 97 is essentially pulled from thin air it's not based on any credible research whatsoever but one survey that claimed 97 of scientists agreed was not based on thousands of scientists or even hundreds of scientists but only on 77 of those 77 scientists 75 answered the survey to form the mythical 97 consensus in this instance the 97 percent wasn't even 97 scientists it's fiction 97 was a figure that was arrived at many years ago by the people who pushed this agenda they then realized they needed some sort of support for it so they did a couple of very dopey papers proponents of man-made global warming often point out that the national academy of sciences in the american meteorological society and other large science groups have issued statements endorsing the so-called consensus view but not a single one of those scientific organizations that have issued these very dramatic statements agreeing with the ipcc and the royal society actually pulled their scientist members and showed that a majority of their members agree many scientists who do not agree with the statement attributed to all of them they never pull their rank and file but it's nothing new we were here 100 years ago and i was in the psychology department i'd be telling you that by the science of craniology black people are stupider than white people west europeans are smarter and more creative than east europeans this was called phrenology and all the data and statistics they could line up and shuffle supported it and everybody believed it to me these kinds of claims of settled science it's it's really antithetical to the scientific process it reflects confirmation bias groups pink so it's simply propaganda the man-made global warming narrative says the evidence is all in and mankind is responsible for a climate calamity so let's first take a look at some of the scientific claims backing up the alleged climate crisis increased amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere mean more heat is trapped warming the earth most scientists agree that rising temperatures are caused by an increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere primarily carbon dioxide fueled by mankind's consumption of fossil fuels is carbon dioxide an essential trace gas in the atmosphere the key driver of global temperatures the co2 we are putting into the atmosphere right now is going to add to warming for decades into the future so you can get to a situation where it just the oceans will begin to boil boiling the oceans before we get there let's first examine the source of all this fear rising co2 levels climate is the most complex coupled non-linear chaotic system known to man of course there are human influences in it nobody knows that but what outcome will they get by fiddling with one variable at the margins i'm sorry it's scientific nonsense the climate system is extremely complex it's virtually impossible to think of doing an experiment where we'd be able to tweeze out the impact of co2 versus the hundreds of other variables at work because we've only been shining our flashlight on one thing let's see human carbon dioxide and aerosols we've been neglecting a whole lot of other things like the sun's influence on climate is carbon dioxide the control knob i don't see anything in the long term geologic record to support that conclusion co2 is one of many many many variables that influence the earth's temperature dr robert giegenkek chaired the department of earth and environmental science at the university of pennsylvania are you afraid of rising co2 concentration no no i'm not co2 is not the villain that has been portrayed co2 is a greenhouse gas it does trap some heat but its ability to trap more heat declines logarithmically this cube represents man-made co2 a greenhouse gas although it can build up in the atmosphere it's only three and a half percent of all the co2 emitted each year the rest is natural water vapor makes up 95 of all greenhouse gases in the atmosphere greenhouse gases make up only two percent of the total atmosphere so is that one cube of man-made co2 driving the climate putting a price tag on each ton of co2 poison co2 poison of co2 poison co2 is not a pollutant it's not a poison and we should not corrupt the english language by depriving pollutant and poison of the original meaning we're really in a co2 famine now most of the time it's at least a thousand you know and it's been quite a bit higher than that the earth was just fine in those times the fact that there was both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when co2 was 10 times higher than today fundamentally contradicts the certainty co2 emissions are the main cause of climate change water is the most important greenhouse gas by far i'm impressed by the fact that the present climate from the perspective of a geologist is very close to the coldest it's ever been the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere today is close to the lowest it's ever been we are currently living on a carbon dioxide starved planet and were we to double carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which is the figure everybody fears that would be a small step back towards restoring the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere you can't use carbon dioxide to control the climate the plants are growing more robustly food crops the trees the forest earth has been getting greener and greener and greener we're just fertilizing the plants so the idea that in doubling carbon dioxide is going to be environmentally catastrophic it's not even wrong it's just a silly idea we're not dealing with a scientific issue we haven't been dealing with a scientific issue now for 15 years we're dealing with a determined political issue it's a campaign cause here's what the temperature has been on our earth now one thing that kind of jumps out at you is well let me put it this way if my classmate from the sixth grade that talked about africa and south america were here he would say do they ever fit together well in fact in an inconvenient truth al gore used the graph of the vostok ice cores he said this proves that co2 and temperature are directly causally related but he didn't show that actually the temperature goes up first usually by about 800 years before the co2 goes up more co2 equals a warmer world true or false i don't know i mean it may be the other way around certainly a warmer world will lead to more co2 but i'm not impressed that co2 is a driver of global temperature and there are so many other variables that are much more likely to have been responsible for that here is where co2 is now way above where it's ever been as far back as this record will measure gore's chart may seem impressive but the geologic record shows that co2 levels in the distant past were far greater than they are today it's already right here look how far above the natural cycle this is and we've done that here's what it's going to be in less than 50 years ultimately this is really not a political issue so much as a moral issue if we allow that to happen it is deeply unethical al gore genuinely believes that if he does not prevail the apocalypse is coming his opponents think he is the danger i think it's a wonderful teaching tool uh because it shows how we don't do science i voted for gore in 2000 yeah and i think that if he ran again depending on who he ran against i might vote for him he's a smart man but after viewing gore's film gigging gak had this reaction and i was appalled i was appalled because he either deliberately misrepresented the point it was making or didn't understand it so it was irresponsible of al gore the verdict from the nobel committee must be sweet vindication even the nobel prize is not going to be enough to silence the naysayers some of whom still believe that mann is not responsible for global warming one of those naysayers is a nobel prize-winning scientist himself physicist dr ivar giavere who won the nobel in 1973. these two people got the nobel prize in peace and i am ashamed of the norwegian government who did that what did al gore leave out as we've detailed there are literally hundreds of factors that influence global temperature the real question is is co2 the tail that wags the dog come here come here this is the question does this part of the dog control the rest of the dog that's the atmospheric equivalent of what al gore wants you to believe good dog al gore wants you to believe that that co2 level up there is the greatest moral and ethical dilemma of our day let's play al gore's game we're going to show you what al gore left out of his famous scene in an inconvenient truth so i think they showed me how to use this thing let's see if i got it here all right let it ride all right steady thank you here we are this is the co2 level al gore wants you to be alarmed at 400 parts per million this according to scientists means the earth is currently in a co2 famine geologically speaking al gore didn't mention that take you up to that co2 level okay al gore did not mention the fact that there are quite literally hundreds of other factors according to scientists that influence our global climate he downplayed all these hundreds of other factors let's just give you but a small sampling of a few let's start with the sun oh okay that's pretty bright the sun is one of the key drivers that al gore tries to diminish volcanoes oh that's a big one is that mount pinatubo volcanoes and the lack of atmospheric dust have had a big impact on our climate there's also cosmic rays there's also solar system impact there's also tilt to the earth's axis whoa okay okay okay steady it out today we're listing okay all right we got it there's also atmospheric circulation okay wind tunnel testing there's also water vapor there's also methane and yes that does include the infamous cows belting in oh really yeah flatulence okay oh no no get it back get back no no we don't need that all right uh you got clouds reflectivity of the earth albedo uh you have forest land use policies soils and ocean cycles okay we have a situation here where all these factories come together this is many other factors that i'll go left out and all of these grow the wind is blowing it's not simply co2 or the sun co2 in the oceans it's co2 versus hundreds of other factories influencing our global climate system into a perfect atmospheric storm raging all the time to so by over emphasizing the role of co2 and underestimating the role of many other factors the whole argument of whether or not the world is heading toward an environmental disaster gets pretty skewed but how is the alleged climate consensus changed over time after all concern about the weather has been around for a long time well before fossil fuels caused global warming everyone was worried about well a coming ice age climate experts believe the next ice age is on its way if we are unprepared for the next advance the result could be hunger and death on a scale unprecedented in all of history what scientists are telling us now is that the threat of an ice age is not as remote as they once thought during the lifetime of our grandchildren arctic cold and perpetual snow could turn most of the inhabitable portions of our planet into a polar desert british professor hubert lamb says that a new ice age is creeping over the northern hemisphere in his comment tonight howard k smith talks about the weather and suggests that we better do something about it howard we are over ready for a return of the ice experts like reed bryson the head of the biggest meteorological department in the world in wisconsin believe that since 1945 that has been in progress we're returning to an ice age the argument that we face some long cold years is pretty convincing the 1970s global cooling scare was widespread before fossil fuels caused global warming fossil fuels caused global cooling we've never been warned like this before all of us about climate change i remember when i was a small boy say 60 years ago snows were frequent and deep every winter a change in our climate is taking place snows are less frequent and less deep thomas jefferson said that a considerable change of climate must have taken place in the polar regions the greenland seas have been covered in ice which in the last two years entirely disappeared this was reported by the president of the uk royal society no not the current president but sir joseph banks president in 1817. here's a more recent quote there are ominous signs that the earth's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically with serious political implications for just about every nation on earth this was from newsweek magazine in 1975 but it wasn't about global warming it was a warning of global cooling 1988 was the year the u.n formed its climate panel the ipcc 1988 was also the year that nasa's james hansen testified to congress about the urgency of global warming it was orchestrated in part by then senators al gore and timothy worth it was a key moment when global cooling was officially put to bed and the conversion to global warming occurred years later a pbs frontline episode lifted the curtain on the sort of illusions that politicians employed to kick off their climate campaigns on capitol hill senator timothy worth was one of the few politicians already concerned about global warming and he was not above using a little stagecraft for hansen's testimony we called the weather bureau and found out what historically was the hottest day of the summer so we scheduled the hearing that day did you also alter the temperature in the hearing room that day what we did it was that went in the night before and opened all the windows i will admit right so that the air conditioning wasn't working inside the room dr hansen if you'd start us off we'd appreciate it the wonderful jim hansen who was wiping his brow at the table at the hearing aid number one the earth is warmer in 1988 than at any time in the history of instrumental measurements one of hanson's former supervisors explained that hanson's dramatic testimony was not well received at nasa we were somewhat appalled we were certainly embarrassed we did not muzzle our scientists at all i probably would have been removed had i tried to to cut off jim hansen's funding after all he had al gore on his team well that was pretty revealing but even that kind of stagecraft isn't enough to completely fool the public you have to keep the people in the dark and by the way three card monty is just another version of the old shell game so let's see what's next in the cards it's clear that the arctic sea ice is beginning to recede very rapidly we saw arctic sea ice diminish to the lowest level we've ever seen already polar bears are starving as the ice they hunt on vanishes along with the seals they eat greenland and west antarctic ice sheet are melting faster than anyone expected the polar bear is it bears a disproportionate burden of the climate the combustion profligacy energy profligacy so the polar bear is having a voice here as part of the march satellite monitoring of the arctic ice began in 1979 at the end of a 40-year cooling cycle when fears of a coming ice age were at their height you have to look at it in the longer perspective and in that long perspective we know that there was as little or less ice in the arctic ocean back in the 1930s to early 40s as there is today the north pole lost one third of its area and 40 percent of its thickness and it didn't cause a huge amount of problem there either with polar bears or anything else are polar bears disappearing in 1960 as few as 5 000 polar bears roamed the earth fast forward five decades their population has only grown there are probably five times as many polar bears now as there were in the 1970s so it doesn't look like they're hurting too much they're looking for poster children it suits their advertising purpose it has nothing to do with science the fact that over the last 20 years of the 20th century there was a minor fall in the area of sea level ice tells you nothing about climate change if you compare the temperatures that were present in greenland in the 1930s for example in 1920s it's clear that it was warmer in greenland in the 1930s than it is right now and so this is nothing unusual perhaps the most inexplicable claim about arctic sea ice came from white house science advisor john holdren if you lose the summer sea ice there are phenomena that could lead you not so very long thereafter to lose the winter sea ice as well and if you lose that sea ice year round it's going to mean drastic climatic change all over the hemisphere oh my okay unless the continents really diverge away you know so that the arctic is no longer enclosed you will have winter sea ice okay so so that's not going to happen mr holden you said there'd be a ice-free arctic in the winter do you still stand by that prediction do you want to retract that can you comment on that i'm late for a meeting he's late for a meeting it's his comment we're seeing records set for antarctic sea ice extent and this is climate models predict that antarctic should be losing sea ice and it's exactly the opposite of what's happening i have to laugh probably for laughing because the energetic ice cap is not melting the average annual temperature there is 58 degrees below zero there's not melting going on in the first place it's actually growing why is the sea ice at record high i think it's getting colder very simple some scientists say sea level has accelerated other scientists say sea level has decelerated climate fair promoters tell us that getting this right could be the difference between business as usual or being all wet if enough of that ice melts seas will rise dramatically and the results will be calamitous the scientists now think a sea level rise of 10 feet of more is inevitable and that there's nothing we can do now to stop it the surreal set of images of what 5 12 and 25 feet of sea level rise would look like at the jefferson memorial the supreme court would be flooded you could tie your boat to the washington monument and storm surges would make the capital unusable there's no question that sea level rise on the whole over the last few decades has accelerated compared to what it was in the past that statement is wrong sea level is not accelerating it is if anything diminishing al gore shows half of florida underwater no there is a model somewhere they are doing it wrong there and this is this is a lobbying so we start geological facts are on one side lobbying and models are on the other side if you look at the total global sea level from about 1850 until the present time it's been rising at a fairly constant rate rather slow about seven inches a century if you're 50 years old you've experienced a sea level rise of about three and a half inches and you probably didn't notice it the rate of sea level rise has decelerated over the last few decades from year to year not two decades but in the last decade i really don't want to argue scientific details with you because i know them better than you democrat as well and as much as you do follow these things tonight on world news force of nature a strange storm in new york a parade of hurricanes tearing across the ocean is this evidence of the new age of global warming wildfires and heat waves are more intense what used to be the extreme literally becoming the new normal hurricane katrina was the first urban extinction and scientists are worried that the sustained droughts are consistent with the overall trend toward global warming far heavier downpours they'll be more frequent now say scientists as global warming heats the air oh it's easy to get lulled into believing these wild claims because we hear them over and over again but if you don't want to be hustled you have to check the deck you have to make sure that all the cards are exposed not just the ones the con man want you to see so let's see what other scientists and data have to say about all these alarming claims it is misleading and just plain incorrect to claim the disasters associated with hurricanes tornadoes floods or drought have increased on climate time scales either in the united states or globally all of the indicators of extreme weather are absent it's not a theoretical issue what the weather would be like below 350 parts per million co2 because until the year 1988 the co2 was below 350 parts per million so if you look through the historical record you see that the weather was just as bad or possibly worse below 350 ppm it is further incorrect to associate the increasing costs of disasters with the admission of greenhouse gases some activists politicians journalists corporate and government agency representatives and even scientists who should know better have made claims that are just unsupportable based on evidence and research the more powerful hurricanes are mainly due to man-made global warming typhoons and hurricanes are getting stronger hurricanes have not increased in the u.s in frequency intensity or normalized damage since at least 1900 the same holds for tropical cyclones globally since at least 1970 when we have good data we are in in the weakest hurricane period since records started being kept in 1900. of course our hurricane luck could run out at any time but the data shows that anyone claiming an increase in hurricane activity due to global warming is off base the forecast from hell why america may see more killer tornadoes tornadoes have not increased in frequency intensity or normalized damage since at least 1950 and there's some evidence to suggest they've actually declined if you look at noaa plots of severe tornadoes they've actually generally been declining since the 19th century and it's making the droughts much more likely and more intense globally and i quote from a recent paper in nature there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years drought has and here i quote the ipcc for the most part become shorter less frequent and cover a smaller portion of the us over the last century a record winner of rain and flood more evidence of global warming floods have not increased in the u.s in frequency or intensity since at least and remarkably flood losses as the percentage of u.s gdp have dropped by 75 percent since 1940. unfortunately the climate models and this is very important for you to understand you can take a look at the ensemble of the united nations climate models they are failing at the 95 percent level they're predicting too much warming i'm not impressed by the ability of the models to either to model the past or to model the future they say when they do the models the current warming can only be explained by co2 well simply untrue it can be explained by a whole host of other factors they just choose not to consider those factors the models tend to overreact to carbon dioxide by warming the earth much more than what has actually happened i think the models are basically flawed temperature records have been altered considerably particularly in the u.s historical climate network the alterations in general result in a in a cooler past and a warmer present the temperature record has essentially doubled in trend over the last 30 years due to adjustments and siding issues the earth is hotter now than ever and humans are to blame the hottest year ever in recorded history i'm running in the park on saturday in shots thinking this is great but are we all going to die you know i can't figure this out we've all heard the hype about the hottest years on record but satellite data tells us that global temperatures have held steady for almost two decades through early 2016. even the ground-based measurements backing up these so-called hottest year claims reveal differences of only a few hundreds to barely tenths of a degree almost immeasurable even if the pause ended today the nearly 20-year standstill in temperatures defied predictions of a planet in crisis 0.8 degrees it will be discussing in global warming 0.8 degrees if you ask people in general what it is they think it's four or five degrees they don't know it's a little it's not even fever i call this sort of stuff kindergarten science the fact that the temperature was warmer at the end of the 20th century than it was in the preceding hundred years is such a piece of kindergarten science it's true and it's completely meaningless in telling you anything about climate change the earth has a fever that is growing more and more intense i do not believe the earth has a fever because it's colder now than it has been through most of the history of life as you can see on the so-called hockey stick graph it looks like a hockey stick lying on its side there you can see the temperatures all the way back to the year one thousand i didn't like it when i first saw it and when i saw that curve two things occurred to me one i missed the medieval warm phase which is very very well documented and most people who've looked at the medieval warm phase think that the temperature was higher then than it is now and the second thing i saw there's a kink in his curve and the kink exactly coincided with the change in the way the measurements were made and that should raise the suspicion of any scientist there hasn't really been any statistically significant warming since 1998 okay this is in spite of 25 of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide has been put in the atmosphere since 1998. you've had a long period with no warming and now accounting for half the set more than half the satellite record so so this is the big mystery and it's exactly until we have a good answer for that i say we don't have any particular confidence in attributing the warming of the last quarter of the 20th century i don't feel the need to explain the halt in warming because there's so many unknowns and there's so many variables in the climate system i could attribute it to almost any the only people who feel a need to explain that is the ones who have gone out on a limb and insisted that co2 is a controlling factor so this pause is now statistically speaking significant it's now something they can't just brush aside they can't just say it's happened before they can't just say it's what they expected they didn't sounds like claims that the debate is over and the science is settled don't hold up very well under scrutiny extreme weather events are not increasing global temperatures are not alarming polar bears and ice caps are doing okay but all good con men know that the confidence game falls apart if you have time to slow down take your time check the details carefully that's why they must insist time is short that action must be taken immediately to avoid a bigger problem we saw this with the y2k scare we also must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment by solving the so-called y2k computer problem now the mayan calendar deadline of 2012 scared many all because folks believe the end of the world is going to come beginning in december three years from now and now global warming advocates have been pushing a series of so-called tipping points saying we will tip the scales and go past the point of no return if we don't act immediately we are running out of time we have to get to an ambitious global agreement we have to do it this year not next year this year this is a huge crisis but then it can cross a tipping point and suddenly shift into high gear i fear there is not a moment to lose and of course the clock is ticking because mother nature does not do bailouts scientists believe we have less than 10 years to bring these emissions under control to prevent a catastrophe there is an urgency to acting unlike anything we've seen before this could be their last best chance to deal with the consequences of climate change we could pass tipping points with grave consequences way back in 1989 the u.n also issued a tipping point a 10-year climate tipping point or entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth be in no doubt that unless greenhouse gas emissions reach their peak within about 100 months just 100 months it may well be too late to stop temperatures rising beyond dangerous levels the grim reality is that our planet has reached a point of crisis and we have only seven years before we lose the levers of control ladies and gentlemen we only we now have only 86 months left before we reach the tipping point we are running out of time how many times have i found myself saying this over recent years it's hard to keep up with all these predictions is it decades we need to cut the consumption of fossil fuels by over half in the next 20 years years the clock is ticking days hours now we have to do something right now to stop global warming why do tipping points persist in the climate debate the experts often don't know any more than you and i about what's going to happen in the future so the idea that climate scientists have this crystal ball and they know what's coming i find that very hard to believe there was global cooling and prior to that there was the population bomb you know millions of people were going to starve to death because we couldn't possibly feed this many humans there's always something it installs fear if you think that your house is going to underwater in the next 10 years you're going to be frightened and you're going to be willing to accept things that are being proposed by other people and we should also understand that psychologically there's obviously something in us as human beings where we are perhaps we have been primed to always be worried about our survival and our existence so we are very predisposed to a narrative that says you know we're all going to die we're all going to die creating artificial deadlines and telling people to hurry hurry hurry is an easy way to pressure them into making poor decisions but there's another way to convince people and trick them into handing over their money it involves the use of magic can man pass legislation through the epa the united nations congress and change and alter the weather the global temperature the path and frequency intensity of storms the scientists at nasa say we can slow the earth's warming if we cut pollution and have higher carbon emission standards it's our choice how fast the seas rise and that gives us time to prepare and protect our communities in a smart way around the world the anger runs as deep as the flood waters being blamed on the global warming the kyoto treaty was supposed to fight carbon could cost us the planet what impact would the epa regulations have on the climate though very very positive this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal climate change is not a hoax more droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke they are a threat to our children's future and in this election you can do something about it you can do something about it you can do something about it when president obama says this will be the time that the water started to recede because i'm elected it reminds me of king knut who took all his advisors down to the shores of england and said see how powerful i am tell the waters to go out what is the real tipping point number when do we have to act by it the real tipping point for me is that governments stay below 2 degrees celsius of global warming not doing it will be catastrophic and basically none of the crops will grow most of people have died and the rest of us will be cannibals civilization will have broken down what the few people left will be living in in a failed state like somalia or sudan so try to attribute a given weather event due to added co2 or whatever is impossible and i think we're misleading the public by telling them that we know why climate is behaving the way it is i would love to be able to think we can control climate when of course it is indeed going to have to be adaptation flexibility but to an outcome that we don't know because i actually don't know what climate they wanting to produce for us and actually i don't think they know either today a form of climate astrology has taken hold where every bad weather event is somehow used to prove man-made climate change has our modern society advanced today global warming is blamed for causing or worsening a whole range of issues including prostitution airplane turbulence crime rape car thefts and bar room brawls that's right your morning cup of joe could become a thing of the past but a new study is dark with no sugar it says climate change has the wild arabica coffee plant headed for extinction in fact anybody who eats is under threat from climate change several liberal lawmakers are pushing a resolution to warn women that climate change could make them vulnerable to quote sex work transactional sex as a woman does it worry you that unchecked global warming will lead to prostitution that's pretty ludicrous yeah u.s senator debbie stabenow michigan has claimed global warming creates volatility and i feel it when i'm flying i don't know who's paying for these studies or who you know where these people get their salaries i mean this stuff is so ludicrous but there's this whole cottage industry will a carbon tax prevent airline turbulence changes in disease trajectories all kinds of implications that we can't even fully fathom global warming is even affecting the dead here's a list of hundreds of things caused by global warming sacrifice to prevent climate change is now being proposed when you see that charge in the wall you have to now say okay that's that's contributing to global warming pollution i have to pull that charger out of the water in 2010 the japanese government told its citizens to go to bed one hour earlier in order to fight climate change are we under seed from nature is the planet angry we've been taking earth for granted you know now i guess it's paying us back witches were once blamed for bad weather and crop failures the severe conditions and climate brought about crop failure starvation disease death and social unrest doctor sally balunis of the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics explained how the severe conditions of the little ice age in the middle ages created a perfect atmosphere for witchcraft trials they said for a hundred years such a storm had not been seen the storm was deemed so unusual in this period of superstition that it had to be unnatural it had to be supernatural every night on the news now practically is like a nature hike through the book of revelation legal philosopher john bowden in 1580 noted that witchcraft was the most terrible problem facing humankind again a very a very modern note no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change now there were skeptics who stood up but they were often accused of or threatened to be accused of sorcery to squash any debate when i tell environmental activists that global warming itself is not something to be concerned about environmental activists attacked me any feeble notes of humane skepticism had to be wrenched out of society they shunned me and they do not allow me to have my materials published in their various magazines and so on any country which tolerates these skeptics will be struck by plagues famines and wars and many other superstitions were common in other cultures in 1450 aztec priests encouraged people to sacrifice blood to the gods to end severe drought that decimated corn crops they ended up sacrificing thousands of people in a few weeks in 1846 in australia aborigines blamed the bad climate on the introduction of the white man in australia in 1933 syria banned the yo-yo because they thought it caused drought during the 1940s some blame world war ii for causing weather extremes global warming climate change global climate disruption global weirding it's been called many names mobile weirding that's really what we're gonna face what actually happens in climate change is that the weather gets weird the hots get hotter the dries get drier and longer and wider the rains get heavier the snows get thicker the weather gets weird the continued identification of every severe weather event or forest fire or whatever with global warming hasn't stopped even though the ipcc itself found very little linkage between human-caused global warming and these extreme weather events that doesn't seem to stop the advocates who are continuing to use science in a misleading way in 2000 global warming activist michael oppenheimer told the new york times that he bought a sled for his daughter but it's been sitting in the stairwell and hasn't been used snow is a thing of the past children won't know what sledding is what do the activists say when the snow started piling up this is global warming even though it's freezing right well and that's that's why i don't like the phrase global warming i like climate change yeah it's going to get hot but you're also going to have snow in the summer in some places every day we are getting new evidence of the effects of man-made climate change today the northeast plains and lower midwest are digging out from another round of snow and freezing rain it's consistent with what you'd expect the message went from global warming causes less snow to global warming causes more snow so boston as of this point is is in its number two snowiest winter this is all part of climate change i think it is more snow less snow forest fires increase forest fires decrease malaria increase malaria decrease more fog less fog winter's warmer winter's colder so no matter the outcome they can claim they predicted it i tried to ask oppenheimer about his sled comment in given that this is the snowiest decade ever recorded for the u.s east coast according to meteorologist joe deleo but my interview with oppenheimer was unexpectedly cut short two thousand new york times you mentioned you bought your daughter a sled but she hadn't been able to use it and then of course nowhere to find us yes he does okay all right well thank you perhaps next time we can ask oppenheimer about his daughter's sled and just where is global warming hitting the hardest scientists called it ground zero for climate change behind us is really ground zero we're ground zero for for climate change florida's ground zero i've noticed in my driving now that i've seen armadillos places where i've never seen them before much farther north than i've ever seen them in the past now let's go back and the same abc news is touting the little armadillo as proof yes you guessed it of global cooling signs of cooling have already begun they began about 1945 homely things like the flight of the heat-loving armadillo from nebraska to mexico the armadillo holds the distinction of being used as evidence of global cooling in the 1970s and now is being used as evidence of global warming throughout history the sun the moon the planets and the stars were often considered magical almost anything could be blamed on the skies above today it seems like almost anything can be blamed on climate change bad coffee crops armadillos migrating north or south tornadoes mummies decaying too fast these are the new measures of global warming as the science behind climate fairs weaken activists are now realizing that if you can't silence the message silence the messenger now hansen has gone even further calling for the ceos of fossil fuel companies to be tried for crimes against humanity they should be blamed because they have supported misinformation to the public do i think they should be in jail i think they should be enjoying three hots and a cot at the hague with all the other war criminals i think it's treason i wish that there were you could punish them under every time you address the holocaust you don't bring somebody in that says it didn't happen there were people saying don't worry hitler is not real it'll disappear i do think it's often a mistake to call them climate skeptics i think they're deniers just as i think president ahmadinejad of iran who claims not to believe that the holocaust occurred he knows it did and we're at that stage now we have we have holocaust deniers we have climate change deniers and to be honest there's a great deal of difference they're almost like the ones who still believe that the moon landing was staged in a movie lot in arizona but these tactics are creating quite a backlash what motivated you to finally speak up anger i was i was pretty angry the quotes were asinine has man been on the moon well uh i helped get man on the moon so i know that man has been on the moon i mean i i'd happen to know that the earth is round and i was being insulted by people who knew far less about these things than i did and i found that preposterous and that's why i decided to start speaking out it did not help me in the least it's only hurt me professionally and for my career it's but you can't you can't sit back and take that kind of thing either they ignore you or they ridicule you and that's not the scientific method and so this hate speech which is the one thing the climate left knows how to do is backfiring badly on them now far from being scared off more and more prominent scientists are re-examining the evidence about man-made global warming and are reversing their views many of them politically left former french party socialist member and award-winning geophysicist dr claude alegre was one of the first scientists to warn about the dangers of global warming in a 1992 letter titled world scientist warning to humanity but allegray took another look at the evidence and he has now reversed himself but you're known here in france for saying that climate change is not man-made do you stand by that that claim yeah absolutely the co2 is in a in a very short proportion in the inner atmosphere but my point is nothing has proved this is man-made climate change green guru and scientist james lovelock was one of the leading voices of man-made climate alarm warming is much more than just a real effect it's something deadly that'll threaten nearly all of us anyone with an imagination can see the awful human consequences of that and we're talking about something which is only about 30 years ahead like are you saying that you're not saying the entire human race will be wiped out but you're saying happens no no but a significant number you're not talking about a party here i'm afraid so as many as seven out of eight are likely to be wiped out yes but lovelock has now turned his back on man-made global warming fairs and has grown steadily more skeptical it hasn't actually happened as predicted has it no it hasn't and it's very interesting because most of us in the in what you might call the earth science game climate science as well and i was one of them i think made quite a big mistake we all thought we knew how carbon dioxide in the air and climate were related i would say since 2004 i've been very lonely mark i've been lonely working on the hill for the democratic party climate statistics professor dr caleb rossiter of american university is an outspoken anti-war activist who has a flawless progressive record climate justice in limiting carbon dioxide emissions is a crime against africa and it's what motivated me to get involved again in this debate but teaching statistics they have to get a peer-reviewed article one of them happened to pick an ipcc approved peer-reviewed article that said we can attribute most of the warming in the last 50 years to carbon dioxide and she's writing her paper that settles it i said no that opens it and she said come on dr rossiter let's sit down and look at the article together and in fact the article had absolutely no proof it just said that this is our model and this is what we do so i raised her grade a little bit to say well you did report what they've said but i can't give you a very good grade because you haven't dug into it and realized there's no basis here for making the statement i have been concerned about global warming since and in the 1980s it looked like the weight of evidence went towards human induced significant to a significant extent and since then it's moved against it the evidence has switched from the mid-1980s to now it's a much weaker case that there's human-induced significant global warming even if all the climate models were true climate change is not an existential threat we've been through much much worse than climate control of this dr richard tall is a lead author for the un climate panel and a professor at the uk's university of sussex toll had his name removed from the ipcc summary for policy makers report in 2014 due to what he considered distortions of science there's a lot of people who did not volunteer knowing full well what the ipcc is like so it's not an open process at all my position on this has evolved over time climatologist dr judith curry is the former chair of the school of earth and atmospheric sciences at the georgia institute of technology if you want to put a date on you know a big sea change in my position regarding the ipcc well it was the period late 2009 again it was triggered by the climategate emails a scandal called climategate a scandal involving some stolen emails the language in the email suggests these scientists manipulated their findings i was extremely concerned by those i thought it did not reflect the kind of behavior all sorts of things that i was concerned about trying to keep data away from people who are trying to get the data i mean to me that was you know something that absolutely they should absolutely have been making the data available when somebody comes along and wants the data by the time you get to late spring of i had been ostracized by the mainstream the consensus and had really been pushed over to the other side if you will by attacks for greenpeace which i was involved in the beginning of it was the threat of all-out nuclear war we cared about humans because our focus was to stop nuclear war in the destruction of human civilization that's the piece in greenpeace the green part of course is nature and over the years gradually greenpeace lost the peace part and drifted into a position of depicting humans as the enemies of the earth and in 1986 i left to become an independent environmentalist basing my positions on science and logic rather than sensationalism misinformation and fear there is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the earth's atmosphere over the past 100 years it's actually not very much about the science it's always been about economic and political choice i come from the left wing politically climate science and these costs are sub-prime science sub-prime economics and above all sub-prime politics but it is as much psychological and social a phenomenon as anything else another politically left scientist to bail out of the global warming movement is physicist dr dennis rancourt rancourt is a former professor and environmental science researcher at the university of ottawa if you want to be an environmentalist if you're really concerned about saving the boreal forest and habitat destruction and so on then fight against habitat destruction don't go off into this tenuous thing about co2 concentration in the atmosphere there was a epiphany for me in the early 90s i became skeptical then but i didn't do anything i started to write a book on the humongous impact that earth's old co2 levels used to have after about four months i said leighton you are the dumbest researcher on earth you're not finding any evidence of the humongous impact that co2 had on earth's old climate because the correlations weren't that good i think it's the damn catastrophe that people are being misled on this issue let's give this global warming nonsense it's waterloo tonight i recently was contacted by somebody out of the blue who said i've seen the attacks on you you know they say you claim to be a member of the house of lords when you're not and they said we can see from the hysterical tone of what is being said that these people are not right and that was our first clue that you were right dr ivar giavere is a nobel prize winning physicist who was one of president obama's key scientific supporters in but a few years later giaver publicly announced his dissent on man-made global warming i don't see that the co2 is the cause of all this problem i resigned from the american physical society because this statement energy is incontrovertible that's a religion that's religious statement climate has become a new religion and that people who disagree would be treated as heretics the title was climate heretic judith curry turns on her colleagues and so i responded with a rather blistering blog post and the punchline of that is that if ipcc is dog mud then count me in as a heretic i was sort of booted out of the tribe if you will when my think tank announced that they were going to start a climate divestment campaign i wrote a very long memo back to the director explaining why i thought this was a terrible idea we need to stop and look at the data i want to have a debate with the staff and the board and he said no we we know your views caleb so it's because i could not reach the board and them directly that i wrote the piece for the wall street journal two days later i was handed my walking papers from a 23-year association with that think-tank they felt it was best that i be terminated because my views on african development and climate change and climate justice were divergent from theirs so i'm willing to express my opinions and have them come out this is the first time i've expressed an opinion that was alien to the left it is a convergence of interests of powerful elites including the media who want sensation the environmental movement who want donations the politicians who want appear to be saving the world the businesses who want to look green the academics and universities that want public money for grants to study this so let's review some of what we've seen because there's certainly no shortage of claims that man-made global warming will result in an ecological disaster with the world's very survival at stake the evidence for this claim is severely lacking by virtually every measure from global temperatures and climate model predictions to polar bears sea level rise and extreme weather events the claims of climate fair promoters are either falling short or going in the opposite direction then there's a claim that rising levels of carbon dioxide are a major threat facing humanity scientists point to geological data that shows co2 and temperature are not in lockstep and co2 is drowned out by many many other variables we've even looked back and forth at the history of climate change claims we've seen scientific consensus move from a coming ice age to a boiling planet and we've discovered that throughout history concerns about the weather have been used to generate fear and manipulate the public we've examined the claims that an overwhelming scientific consensus exists for man-made global warming the oft-repeated notion that 97 of scientists agree we've shown that this alleged consensus is merely an illusion carefully crafted by what amounts to an ideological effort to promote global warming fares in their so-called solutions and we've shown that an increasing number of prestigious scientists are re-examining the evidence and are challenging the climate claims being put forth by the united nations al gore and climate activists and being hyped by the mainstream media we've seen a lot but we've not seen all the cards just yet because there's still one more deck one more deck to explain much of what's behind the global warming movement in our next film we will complete the picture of the climate change grand narrative and the agenda behind it outrage growing over the co-chair of a un climate change panel saying this one must say clearly that we redistribute the world's wealth by climate policy one of the ways it will drive the change is through global governance and global agreements we will look at the financing of the climate establishment and the big green movement behind it it is absolutely true that the money available for global warming statements and research is driving academia right now and people line up together the sierra club took 26 million from natural gas and michael has the audacity to try to imply that skeptics are fossil fuel funded you also had a financial interest given that a quarter million dollars came from hollywood barbra streisand to fund you we will expose the hypocrisy of many of the politicians hollywood celebrities and other top climate campaigners for instance did you know that just air drying your clothes for six months per person saves 700 pounds of carbon dioxide people will criticize leonardo dicaprio who's made comments like i'll fly around the world to fight global warming they'll criticize al gore because of their carbon footprints and lifestyle does that take are they the best spokesman my brother that is such a uh obligatory yeah that's a question that you shouldn't be asking here today because that that defies the spirit of what this is about so anyone who attacks leonardo dicaprio is either a coward or an idiolog we'll look at how kids are being fed climate fears from a very young age global warming 30 years that won't affect me please help the world like getting your dad to insulate the loft or taking your next holiday by train instead of flying or buying energy saving light bulbs now no pressure at all but it'd be great to get a sense of how many of you might do this just a rough percentage that's fantastic and there's not philip and tracy that's fine that's absolutely fine your own choice okay class thank you so much for today oh just before you go i just need to press this little button here now everybody please remember to read chapters five and six on volcanoes and glaciation we will look at some of the well odd solutions to global warming maybe things like hygiene where we've now normalized showering every day sometimes twice a day that means we have to wash our [ __ ] change our clothes every day they've called for quote radical and immediate de-growth strategies in the us we need a radical almost overnight change the only way to to stop runaway climate change is to terminate industrial civilization and some other solutions that are just plain terrifying you're not endorsing dismantling physically uh violation of the law or any kind of eco-terrorism are you it depends on the circumstances it's a possibility means necessary we mean by any means necessary we would support it i call this human engineering and what it involves is the bio biomedical modification of human beings we can make humans smaller so reducing the average height in the u.s by just 15 centimeters for example would mean a mass reduction of 20 23 for men and 25 for women with a corresponding reduction of the metabolic weight of 15 to 18 percent obviously less people would exert less pressure on the natural resources and making fertility management ubiquitously available because we are already today already exceeding the planetary carrying capacity africa is projected to have more people than china or india by mid-century more than china and india combined by the end of the century and this is one of the causal factors that must be addressed we reveal how new global warming based energy restrictions are leading the world into energy poverty and finally we'll take a detailed look at how the so-called climate change solutions will not only impact the world's economic health but will have devastating impacts on the world's poor who struggle to survive without running water or electricity there's over a billion people in this world with no electricity the effort to fight global warming by reducing co2 emissions by reducing our use of fossil fuels harms the poor around the world more than anybody else we're being asked to spend 50 billion dollars a year to have no impact on global climate that i think is unconscionable morally thanks for watching and i look forward to seeing you for our next film this is mark morano and i hope you will start asking hard questions and examining the evidence about global warming fears for yourself the planet's warming in the streets causing quite a sensation a message being preached by the united nations that the polar cap is melting like it's covered with salt and then they'll all tell you it's america's fault so all the so-called experts feel they should warn you the temperature is higher in california they say there's lots of global warming in every town and you believe the experts and we're all gonna drown but global warming is just a bunch of hot air don't care you
