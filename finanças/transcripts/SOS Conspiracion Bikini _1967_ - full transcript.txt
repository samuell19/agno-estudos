April of 1954 Whoever may have seen it, looking towards the bay, would think that it was just a simple fisherman. No one could have imagined, that the binoculars contained a camera, with which he recorded all that was happening in the bay. The message from this simple fisherman, was sent by letter to an agency in Paris. The letter contained a coded message, which was sent to the Central Intelligence Agency, headquartered in the city of lights. It was a microfilm, which had been attached to the letter in the form of a dot. This is how a message was discovered, which could be read easily, with the aid of an amplification camera. David: My God, why have you forsaken me? The coded message was sent to the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Counter-espionage service. The message was decoded and it revealed the routes of arms shipments being sent to Latin America. The counter-espionage service took the necessary measures, and thanks to a seemingly humble and simple fisherman, They destroyed the plans of greatest terrorist plot in Latin America. but, the agitators would not stand still. They would attempt to fullfill their plans, but, where, when, and why? The Intelligence department had no clue.

Look Inspector, inside the banana, and there is a good amount of it, don't you think? Quite ingenious. Now we have all the suspects. They will spend a good amount of time in prison.

But, you know, I have a date in Quito, and don't want to dissapoint. Just one moment, Alex be careful with the skirts, they only bring more complications. you think?

No, I have a prior engagement, I will see you later. Did you have any problems? No, everything is rolling along, Ms. Bristol. Except for one thing, that girl, I have seen her somewhere else. Which one? The red head. A member of the International Service? I do not know, but it is something we must find out. There is no time for that, there is but one solution. There is, we must not take any risks. Truly, I am having the best of luck. This is my first night off. What did you say your name was? I didn't say. Well, it does not matter, a name is not that important. It seems you do not like to waste any time. Of course not. Then what are you doing here? you will accompish nothing here.

No, wait! Yes, he is quite free for the night! Lucrecia, Lucrecia! Yes, Luigi? Come immediatedly, I must speak with you. I am coming, just a moment. Luigi? What is wrong, why so nervous?

Do you think that all the precautions our organisation has taken, are useless? Its that we must not take any risks. Has it dawned on you that it is insane for all of us to remain here, together? Any slight error, can finish our organisation, with one blow. You know it is necessary. I have been working here for the last two months, and nothing abnormal has happened. All is rolling along, please Luigi, do not worry. Say, Lucrecia, when do you go on stage? In just a moment, Don't you enjoy seeing me as an entertainer in a night club? You would enjoy it even more to see me as a designer of swimwear. can you help me , please? May I? Thanks I must congratulate you. You swim quite well. I have already thanked you, what else can I say to you, Mr. Dinamo? Ah, you know my name, that means you have heard of me. You are wrong,I only know your name, and I am not interested in knowing you. Alex. Where where you, I was looking for you. Adriana Its just that I came out for a stroll on this wonderful night. to take in the fresh air, and to gaze upon the moon. A moon in a blue bikini?

You are becoming quite the dangerous Cassanova. Me? Why do you say that? I have my reasons. Should I bring Mr. Dinamo's car? No, bring mine! Adriana, wait! wait. What happened to you...you are quite the mess. I was trying to stop a man from shooting a woman. Who was he? I do not know, It was dark. And who was she? Don't know, I only saw her shadow. Oh, sure. Ah,I see, there goes your "ghost." Say..no... bast... Forgive me, I tought it was one more of your tricks. Oh, the message. Get in, quick, tonite, we shall dance at the Crazy Horse. Ah! Dinamo? zero zero one hundred So, it was you. I have something very important to inform you, but now it is much to dangerous, I am being followed. I will contact you, Careful! Excuse me, miss, did I harm you? No, not that much. Now you will tell me that you had another fight, and someone tried to kill you, right? Of course, look... We have been waiting three minutes for you. Excuse me . Ms. Bristol but... There is no time for explanations! We will begin our business. Our best weapon has been and always will be, terrorism. It has given us great results in countries that are already under our control. But... but what has happened in the countries where you work? nothing. Absolutely nothing. Only some skirmishes and nothing conclusive. This is why we are meeting here. Report to me your activities. I will advise you of new systems, and new weapons. Where is that red head? She went out a few minutes ago, Madame. The red head was here with us. She was in a hurry, but did not say where she was going. If she is not here on time, you start the show with the special design, allez, allez! Yes, Madame, I will be ready. And you follow with the "Springtime Dream" design! And then in the rehearsed order. Yes, Madame. Where where you! At the beauty salon, Madame. You are so late, we are about to start! Yes, Madame. Good luck, girls, and don't get nervous. Say, don't you think its lovely? My dear Adriana, I have had no time to admire the swimsuits. No doubt our convention has been a success. We needed a convention such as this, We will coordinate our plans, and correct misteakes. This design is so lovely, right? I think its precious. I am refering to... the bikini, yes, thats what I said. This one is also lovely, but I just don't like the color. Don't see what's wrong with the color, its wonderful. This was an idea formidable, if it wasn't for... there is nothing to worry about, all has been taken care of, Madame. "Tonight, San Francisco Convent" May I be informed at what time the date starts? Take a look. Quite mysterious for a love date, don't you think? Come on, we are next. Ok, Ok, if you want to stick your nose in this, go ahead. It is enough that there are skirts involved for you to be interested. but let me tell you this, we will find out nothing, untill we know all of the victim's background. unless you know something, Alex. What do you know? Not much, Inspector. I only know who killed the model. And if you know, why not spit it out? It was...the murderer. Ah, another one of your bad jokes. May I look trough your notes? And what is it to you about my notes? No, I am refering to the documents of the murdered model, may I see them? What are you doing? Making sure of the authenticity of these documents. I am sorry to tell you, Inspector, It will be very difficult to identify the victim. Ah, so you mistrust the efficiency of the police? Nothing like that. To the contrary, they deserve all my respect. But what I can assure you, is that , these documents, are fake. Are you sure? A ha, absolutely. What are you doing? taking some pictures. No doubt, you are quite ingenious. But this gadget has never done you any good. You think, Inspector? Very well, I will take a look around, and will keep you informed. One moment. Remember, no violence, so anything comes up, notify my immediatedly. Do not react on your own. No worries. Come here please Yes, Inspector? I want these documents analysed, and duplicate the passport photo. Immediatedly. Wait. Keep an eye on Dinamo, I do not want him complicating things. He knows something, inform me of all his movements, understood? Yes sir. Go ahead. Well, very well. I see you have learned quickly, Adriana. Thank you, Madame. Remember no to think of what has happened, it was horrible, but it has passed. We cannot do anything for her now, let this be a lesson. Surely,it was one of those, crimes of passion. Go change, we must see the next designs. Good morning, Madame Rapee. Look, I admit no one to interrupt my work. So, if you are here to see your friend, it is best for you to leave, and dont come here again. Allez! I am sorry, I do not know what friend you are talking about? She is talking about me. Ah, I see you got a job, I am glad. Yes, but not for long, If you do not leave immediatedly! Ok, Madame, In reality, the only thing I wanted, was to interview the models. Are you une, police? Not exactly... They have undergone all kinds of questioning, And I do not want the girls to be nervous with what happened, so leave! In that case, please forgive me, I will bother you no more, Excuse me. Ok girls, lets go. Diana? who is it? Dinamo. I want to ask you some questions. Come in, the door is open. grab a drink, relax, I will be out soon. Why did you take so long? I have been expecting you. I will explain... I will explain the reason for my visit. Reasons do not matter. I only want you to answer some questions about... It will be best for you to ask nothing. Can you pour me a drink? a...drink? Double? If you like. Double. I only want you to answer one question. Would you like it if I told you...that I like you? What do you know about her? Oh, you are refering to the murdered girl. The same. I know many things. Tell me. I know she was a model, who came to a swimsuit designer's convention. What else. And that she was murdered. The only thing I don't know is who did it. Are you satisfied? No, I am not. Surely, you will be. S.O.S. he is in the elevator. its stoped on the second floor. Open up, Laura. Need something? I want some info on the murdered girl. Please sit down, Mr... Dinamo Please, sit Thanks. Smoke? Very kind of you. Do you understand the incovenience we have had with the police inquiry? We are not used to that line of inquiry. But I will be delighted to cooperate, with what little I know. Hopefully, it will be of use to punish the perpetrator. Ms. Bristol, I would like to know about you. I will spare you from a long line of questioning Laura? Give him what I dictaded persuant to the case. Here you have all I know about the unlucky girl. When she was hired, how we met her, etc. And... I will ask for you to bother me no longer, Mr... What did you say your name was? Forget it, it is not important. Show him out. Thanks. I need a secretary just like you, when you wish to resign, know that I await you with open arms, eh. I would like to have you as a boss, but I am quite pleased with my current job. Good bye, Mr. Dinamo. I do not like that guy. Easy, Pascual, easy. I am tired of this lack of activity! C3, go ahead. S.O.S. Reporting S.O.S. Reporting Alex Dinamo is headed your way.

We know about what. Here is all you need to know about the matter, I hope that our data will help you resolve the case, and punish the perpetrator. This is quite queer, those same words I have heard from the lips of, Ms. Bristol. I can see that you have quite the perfect organization. Oh no, no, Mr. Dinamo, we are men of action, businessmen, executives of important corporations, and we are not acustomed to wasting our time! What's the matter, Alex? Are you still dedicated to investigating? Or to have fun taking plunges fully dressed? That is correct, Inspector, can't you see I am trying out the swimsuit I will model at the conference?

Very well, you lot already found out? I only wanted to take pictures of the important people attending the conference. That was all. Mr. Dinamo It is logical that you should fail as a vulgar detective, unlike us, who are specialized agents. So I would suggest for you to not move! It was a good idea of yours, that. My picture could have been identified by the intelligence service, but I can assure you, that will not be so. Freeze, Mr. Dinamo! It seems you fail to understand that behind this book is a machine pistol with silencer, ready to fire. Very well, I will demonstrate. Lucrecia? Report in. Calling HQ, calling HQ? Go ahead, Lucrecia.
