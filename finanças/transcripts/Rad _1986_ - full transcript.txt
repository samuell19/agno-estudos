Damn it. - And without further ado, our partner in Helltrack and president of the Federation of American Bicyclists and owner of the Mongoose Bicycle Company, Mr. Duke Best! - Thank you, Mayor Jenkins, for your wonderful introduction. And thank you, you wonderful citizens of Cochrane for allowing us to share with you this beautiful city and community. This could be mutually beneficial to all of us. - That, Mr. Best, is what we're counting on. - And I publicly wanna thank you, Mr. Timmer, for your enormous contribution in this venture, in helping make Helltrack a reality. And I assure you we will not disappoint you. - You really must understand, Mr. Timmer, that, well, a race such as Helltrack has never even been attempted in BMX history, but when you put up $100,000 and a new Corvette, you're gonna have all the top factory riders right here. - Think about it! TV cameras in every corner of the town showing on network television the spirit of Cochrane and of course my bicycles. - Excuse me. Not to put a damper on the spirit of things, but I wonder how our kids are going to feel when hundreds of outside youngsters take over their town and they're not allowed to race in their own backyard. - Hey, just a minute. Trust me, Mrs... - Grey. - Mrs. Grey. See, most of our factory riders are professionals. That matter, you don't have to worry at all. They're respectful and fair. As far as the local youth are concerned, well, we'll see that that's taken care of. We will hold a... qualifying race... And I will put up-- $10,000 for any local youth who can qualify and run in Helltrack regardless of whether or not he wins Helltrack! - It's a deal. Mayor.

I think I've got a chance. - You have a chance with an education. - I know about that Mom but Dad always told me when your gut talks to you, you listen. - Oh Christopher, that won't wash with me.

The very finest riders in the country are here, riding for some $100,000 and a Chevrolet Corvette. Now later this week you will see the BMX Helltrack finale, but for today, it's qualifying, the qualifying rounds. Prior to it, it's our great pleasure to bring you the man who's responsible for all of this. The founder of the Federation of American Bicyclists, FAB, Mr. Duke Best. Duke, a real pleasure to have you with us, sir. - Well, well, thank you, Bill. It's my pleasure. - Well, tell us now, what is the concept behind Helltrack? - Well, you see, Bill, we decided that we needed our very own Super Bowl, so we hired the very best experts to build and design a track that combines the different styles and skills of BMX racers and freestylers. It's never been done before, you know. - Until we came to Helltrack. - Exactly. Helltrack. But considering we have all the top participants of the factory riding in this one, I wouldn't exactly. I wouldn't exactly bet the house on any newcomer winning this one. - Well, thank you, Duke. Now let me explain to you the rules and regulations for Hell-- - Bill. Bill, let me explain the rules. - That's a little unusual. Oh, he has them right-- - Each participant will run three qualifiers to get to the big one. Each race will get tougher as lesser experienced riders are eliminated. And the 20 racers with the best time will have the opportunity to race Helltrack! - Well, right now let's meet some of the top BMX racers. Right, right, and right there, right there, the most proud one of all is, right there, the number one rider, the ace BMXer of all time, my man, Bart Taylor. ♪ John Farnham's "Thunder in Your Heart" Playing ♪ ♪ You're taking a chance, risking it all ♪ For the thrill of the moment ♪ Taking a stand, you ain't gonna fall ♪ And you've always known it ♪ They're dying to shake you ♪ Trying their best to break you ♪ And though the goal is rough ♪ You're going home as a hero ♪ 'Cause there's thunder in your heart ♪ Every move is like lightning ♪ It's the power you feel ♪ When you get your taste of the glory ♪ The fire gonna start ♪ And you know they're goin' under ♪ You can light the dark when they ♪ Hear your heart of thunder Bart Taylor making quick work of heat one.

Ew! - Riders for heat two in the line, riders for heat three into the staging area. - Good luck, Cru! - Come on, sweetheart. In heat three, 17-year-old Cru Jones will give local fans something to cheer about as he goes up against some of the sports best. - Goddammit, Cru. - Jones adds some down home flavor to these races. He says he gained his experience delivering newspapers. - Hey Bob, come here. Look at that. Ain't that the kid you work with? - Yeah, I hope he gets his butt kicked. - Come on, Bob, lighten up, huh?

And now I have a chance to be the best, maybe the best in the world. I can take those SATs any time, maybe in six months. But this is the only opportunity I'll ever have like this. I started out as one in 1000, now it's one in 20. Now, to give that up, I think that would be very self-destructive. - I want you to make me a promise that in six months you'll take those SATs no matter what! - No matter what, I promise. Mom? Thanks. The surprise of the clay, the local delivery boy, Cru Jones, who although he never won a race, amassed enough points to assure himself a place among the best BMXers in the world. - Did you find out who that kid works for yet? - Look, no, Duke, I've been busy. - Damn it, when I tell you do something, do it! - You know, I really didn't think she'd understand. - Better yet, I think I'll buy him. - Hey Cru, man, where are you, buddy? - Cru, Cru! - Buddy, where are ya? - Is he here, no, he ain't in here! - Guys, break it up. - Whoa, hey, hey. - Whoa, there he is! - Here's my, man, ow!

Oh, you'll live. - Hey, what's the big deal, Duke? This guy doesn't even stand a chance. I'm gonna wipe him. - What the hell do you know? I've got millions of dollars of products with your face on it ready to be put in every department store in this country as long as you cross that finish line on national television first! So don't talk to me about big deals! - Duke, calm down, don't let this kid get you so upset. - I've never seen such raw determination and talent in one kid! No way, no way is he gonna screw up everything I've worked for and you remember that! - Adam, Schwinn, all right, go on in. - Thank you. - Cru Jones. - Jones, Jones, Jones. No, I don't seem to have your name on my list. Who's your sponsor? - Sponsor? - Who do you ride for? - Well, me, I ride for me. - Well, that's impossible. I was told that you had to have a sponsor to race. - Well, since when, I've never heard that. All you had to do was qualify. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Gosh, you kids are gonna have to forgive us for this one. - What are you talking about? - Well, it's most unfortunate, but that is the new rule. No sponsor, no racey. Mr. Best is just sick about it and so am I. You know, he was totally unaware of this rule when he made the announcement about the qualifying race. Now, of course, we're gonna give you the $10,000, but unfortunately no racey. You know, it's kind of a shame to bring this up, but this is all your fault. - What's that mean? - Come on Christian, I know. - Do you wanna tell me what that was all about? - Best told me that if I rode for him that he would make me a star and all this money if I threw the race. - Oh, that weasel. - Wait, you know about that sponsorship stuff, don't ya? - Well yeah, it's pretty simple. A sponsor pays for your expenses then you promote their product. Well, like, for instance. Hi Jer. He obviously races for Coke. - Coke. That's big time. - Yeah, well most sponsors are. Know any heads of corporations? - No, I don't personally, but I think Luke's in good with AT&T, I'll check with him in the morning. - Hey, you guys. You hear they ain't gonna let Cru race? - Why not? - They say he needs a sponsor. - Oh bullshit. - Who says so? Hey, Cru, we heard what those creeps did to ya. - Yeah, we ain't gonna stand for it. - Yeah, if you don't race, no one races. We oughta go to Helltrack and rip that mother down. - Cru, I have something for you, I made it myself. So you can wear it when you race. - It's real nice, Wes. - You hate it? No, he doesn't hate it, Wes. - Yes, he does. - Would you make a couple of these for my kids? They just love them. - They're 10 bucks a shot! Okay, but you're a little thief. - Hold it, we're not done yet. - Wes, we're gonna use this and their 10 grand to beat 'em at their own game. - Thank you. - I'm supposed to color the T-shirts. Is this where I can get my homework done? - That's right. Okay, biology, that's line two. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hey, somebody, we need some pins down here. - Here's your homework, Picasso! Hey, Luke, don't you dare mess that helmet up. That's my only one. Where'd you get that goofy hat anyway? - I don't know. - I do. Hey, would you guys hurry it up, please. Cru, just stand still. - I did a couple wrong so it looks like you did it. You think I can get a mannequin to stand up here for me? I'm gettin' dizzy. Okay, Becky, just pin that sleeve up a little bit. - That smells terrible. Never mind the dye, stand still! I'd work better if you'd get off my hand! Hey, hey, Becky, be careful what you're doin' there. - Here's your homework. - Oh, thank you. - It looks nice. - How's the length? - Looks good, Becky. - Yeah, that's all right. - You'd actually look good with a couple of pins in you, Cru. I'll hold the pins, Christian. - Okay, the top looks good. Let me just get in here so I can get the inseam. - Whoa, what are you doing? - I'm just gonna measure your leg so I can make your pants. - Okay, well, be careful, this is my career we're talking about. - I will be careful. Straighten out your knee there. - Ow! What are you doing? - I didn't do anything. - Oh, oh, very funny! Amy, I'll race you to the door. - You're on! - Night, Amy. - Night. - Good night, guys. - Night. - All right, guys. - Catch you later. - Take care, see ya. Damn, I was so right about those guys. - Come on, it's so obvious from the moment you see them together. - Yeah, I know, but they never copped to to it like that before. - Well, they probably just didn't want you to feel left out. - Yeah, so what's changed? Just kidding. - Kidding! - How's that? - Hey! - Well, how about that? Looks like the local yokel's gonna race after all. - Well, how about that? - That's fine, he'll get his shot and then Best and everybody else will know who really is the champ. - Let's go. - Let's get outta here. - Christian, there's been something that's buggin' me. I need to talk to you about it. What's all this number one about? - Self explanatory. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. - You think you're pretty bad, huh? - Hot. - Okay, little miss number one, little special number one. Why don't you follow me? - Okay. ♪ John Farnham's "With You" Playing ♪ - A little table toppy? - Ugh, child's play. ♪ Paint me a scene where the water's rippling ♪ And dripping us by the heels ♪ We'll be soaking wet and then joking about - Come with me, come on! - Well, if you're gonna show me something, show me something serious! ♪ With you by my side, who can say what stroke of luck ♪ Might strike today - Ah, you freak! ♪ To everyone in town - You know, I don't understand it. You waste two cans of beans to make hot chocolate in river water, and the worst part is, we don't even have any milk. Now tell me, what is hot chocolate without milk? Watcha thinkin'? - Just about everything that's happened to me this week. It kind of reminds me of when I was like four years old and the first time my dad let go of that bike. It was like a whole new life. All of a sudden, it was like I was in control. I could go as fast I wanted. It was scary but it felt good. - You're scared now? - Yeah I am, but I wouldn't trade any of it because day after tomorrow, win or lose, I'm there. - Well, well, well. - Interesting, isn't it? - Interesting? Free enterprise. Something you should know all about, huh? - You're welcome. - Thanks, kid. - Here you go. You don't get one. - Please, Wesley, everybody else has one. - No! - Wes, come on. - Okay. - You can give him the ripped one. - Thanks. - Hello, Christian. Now this warms the heart. - What heart? - Only in America can a group of young people take the bull by the horns and make something happen. I'm proud of ya, son. - Hey, mister. Are you gonna blab or are you gonna buy? - Now she's a cute little thing, isn't she, Elliot? - Precious. - How much are the shirts? - 10 bucks each. - Wow, that's a lotta money. How many have you sold? - 48, we're rich! - Yes, we are, we certainly are rich. Let's see, that's $480. At that rate, it'll be about $49,520 before start time tomorrow. - What are you talkin' about? - Elliot. - According to Helltrack Bylaw Number 812.3 Bravo, to be eligible, a rider must be sponsored by a company with at least $50,000 in sales. Simply put, it means no 50,000, no race. It is a new rule. - Hey, you come here, I'll show you the rule! - Don't! - Now, that would be the second mistake you made with me, buster. - I don't like you guys. - You really are very cute. - Wes, Wes, Wes! - Ow, geez! - Let me go! - Cru, wait! - Well, Burton. Looks like you almost had yourself a hometown hero, huh? - Yeah, almost. - Good, I like your attitude. - What's that supposed to mean, Best? - Well, I'm beginning to see you as a man who stands by his convictions. And I like that. - I'm beginning to see you as something I might have stepped in, and I don't like the smell of it. - Oh, Cameron, Cameron, Cameron. You didn't get where you are by being soft, don't start now. - Remember this, Best. Nobody uses me. - Boy, Duke, you really nailed those kids back there. They'll never come up with that 49 grand. - Will you please leave, guys? Luke and Becky thought maybe I'd Find you here. - Would you please go away? - Do you think that you're the only one who's been hurt? - Do you wanna know what I'm thinking? What a fool I was not to take Best's offer. Everything else has been a joke. - Yesterday you said you wouldn't have traded it for anything. - Well, bullshit! That was yesterday! You know, nothing can compete with money. I'm glad I learned that now! You gotta take what you can get or you're screwed! - You know, I was wrong. Just because everything isn't going your way you wanna bail. I thought you were a man. - Christian. - Well, I'll be damned. - Yeah, I knew I could do it! Beautiful! - Hi, guys! Good work. Good work, keep it up, keep it up. Hi, Norm! - Hi, Norm. Hey, with all this Helltrack exposure we'd oughta be able to move that new Mongoose product line off the shelves in about a week? - Ah. - Aren't you just a little ahead of yourself, Elliot? - I mean, according to the contract, Taylor has to win first. - Don't worry, he'll win. - I've heard your bullshit before, Best. He better win. - Come on! - Come on, quiet down! Quiet! It's not right! Those kids worked as hard as they could! They worked as hard as they could. - Order. As mayor, I see no point in wasting good money. - That's not the point! Why not? - I agree with her! I think we should take every opportunity to give a local boy a chance! And he's such a nice boy. - Just a moment! Just a moment, please, please! Can I have a word here? I thought I heard it all till now. I've watched these kids grow up. I've chased every one of them. I think Cru and his friends have done something special, real special. They have given themselves hope, and all your talk about dollars is killin' that hope. If someone doesn't see that Cru has this opportunity, well, I guess we'll all have to learn to live with it. - And a bag of this, please. - Can I talk to you for a second? - I guess so. - Would you like to be my friend? Hey, Cru! - Go away. - Cru, they're having a meeting about you. - Who is? - 1000, thank you, thank you. 1200. - 1200. - 600. - 600. - We're still $27,000 short. - We're just about ready to get the festivities underway. With us is the founder of FAB, Mr. Duke Best. And shortly he's gonna be presenting this award to Ms. Christian Hollings as the number one amateur female rider in America. That's coming up right off. Well, here's an interesting late note. A change, local son Cru Jones and his Rad racing team have met the eligibility requirements. Now what that means is that we're gonna have all 20 riders in competition on Helltrack later today. Let me ask you. Duke, Duke? We'll be back right after this commercial message. Hey, Duke! - You better leave, honey. I don't think I want you to hear this. You and you. All you have to do is take out that kid. - You bet - We got ya. - Then all you have to do is win. Do I make myself clear? - That is bullshit. - You have just made one big mistake. - How's that? - Well, Burton, I hear you have quite a collection of Rad shirts. - That's true, Duke, $27,000 worth, and I'm gonna keep every one of 'em. Because I got a hunch that by the end of this race they're gonna be mighty valuable. Duke, don't get left out. I'd run right over to that stand and buy as many as you can. - Let's cut out playin' games with each other, Timmer. You have as much to lose as I do if Taylor doesn't win today. We both know what 50 % of nothin' is. - What you're trying to tell me, Duke, is that I should see to it that Cru loses, is that it? - Now you're getting it, you big hick. - Duke, get this. - Cru. - Yeah. - Sign my cast? - Sure. - Hey, don't be intimidated by those guys out there. Just go for it. - Thanks, Ray. Cru, Cru, Cru, Cru, Cru, Cru, Cru! - Go for it. - Take care. Cru, excuse me! - Hey. God, what I wouldn't give to go ass sliding with you right now. - Why? I believe in you, don't you believe in yourself? - Yeah. - Well, what are you waiting for? Go get 'em. - Cru! You can do it. Just pretend you're in the lumberyard. Go balls out. And welcome to Helltrack. This is the most diabolical combination of jumps, turns, and obstacles yet created to test the world's best BMX riders. $100,000 the monetary incentive for these young professionals, but it's more than cash that challenges these racers at the brink of this 25-foot wall. Here's the starting feed. Riding for Team Hutch, from Canada, Jeff Ingram. For Team Robinson, from San Diego, Richard Fleming. Robert Rupe of Los Angeles for DK Racing. The Powerlite racer, Danny Millwee. From the Redline team, from Torrance, California, Scott Clark. Canada's Kirk Bihun has qualified for Norco and Supersaco. Martin Aparijo for GT. Glen Adams out of Utah will be riding for Bingham Bikes. The Pindlepower rider is Chris Phenix. For Team Robinson, it's Travis Chipres. For Team GT, Eddie Fiola, as well as Kevin Hull from Texas.

Team Mongoose qualifies three riders, the Reynolds twins, Rod and Rex, out of Bay Shore, Long Island, as well as the number one rider in the nation, Florida's Bart Taylor. Then there's the independent, the privateer, for Rad Racing, Cru Jones. - I know that kid. - Which one? - The one in the red. - Ah, you don't know him. - Yeah, I do, I work with that guy. - Really? - Yeah, Cru's my buddy. - Keep an eye on that boy in red, he's a local. He's a fine young man. - The field in the starter's hands. Every rider focusing on this three-story drop. Getting set. There's the gun! Cru Jones, number 33, has taken an unexpected lead over Bart Taylor. Taylor's teammates, the Reynolds twins, are third and fourth. Jones off the wall and extending his lead as he moves into the moguls. Jones getting pressure from the nation's number one rider Taylor in the S's. Here comes the cliffhanger. Like in baseball, here you're either safe or you're out. Jones is on. Taylor is safe. The Reynolds twins barely making it. And Mike Miranda is out. The end of lap number one, the local rider Jones is out in front! Bart Taylor draws even with Jones. - Cru! - Get up! Get up! Get up! Jones, he's regaining his feet. He's gonna try and continue. Back on the track, he's 12th. Team Mongoose struts their stuff. Ooh, Rex Reynolds bites the dust as Cru Jones picks up a couple of spots. Reynolds is up, he still maintains third. - Let's go! Cru Jones riding as if possessed. He's moving into fifth! Jones flies into fourth. Two laps down, two to go. Jones laps Mike Miranda back up in racing after that spectacular spill earlier. And we've got a rider down! It's Hollywood Mike Miranda, his second dramatic exit of the day! Bart Taylor on the point, does a little grandstanding. - That was bad, that was bad! What a short cut! Oh my heart a back flip, Hulk Hogan eat your heart out. Taylor's lead diminishes. His teammate, Rod Reynolds, wants first place. Reynolds is hit! Taylor takes his own man out, good night team strategy! Here is Taylor stopping, he wants Cru Jones one on one! The top rider in America Taylor puts his reputation and $100,000 on the line to a determined unknown challenger who just keeps coming on. - Come on, baby! Jones moves to challenge. In unison they clear that jump. Jones on the inside, Taylor outside, Jones goes into first. Shoulder to shoulder they peddle through the final half lap. Taylor regaining the lead. What a fantastic finish developing. Dead even as they move to the final hurdles. Down to the finish, for the checkers, Jones versus Taylor. One more jump. Give it to Jones, Cru Jones wins it! - Luke! - Come on, baby, he won! - Norm, wait a minute! Come on, where you goin'? We can sign that Jones kid. - Leave me alone, okay? Better still, go away. The benevolent organizer of this great event, Mr. Duke Best, will be holding a special winner's party.
