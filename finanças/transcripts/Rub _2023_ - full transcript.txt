- [Neal] Every day I sit alone. I sit in traffic by myself. All I see is love. Love all around me. But when I look at myself. I see no love. No one by my side. (foreboding thud) (foreboding minimal music) - Neal. Get that memo I sent about the report yesterday? - Um, yeah, I'm, I'm working on it right now. - And what, Neal? Why isn't it on my desk already, Neal? - I'm doing it right now. I'll- - I need it right now, Neal. I'm fucking with you, man (laughs). You gotta lighten up. I got you though, I had ya. - Mm-hm. - You ah, you doing anything this weekend besides hanging out with that fucking fish tank of yours that I keep hearing about? - It's a turtle tank. - Yeah, whatever. In all seriousness though, I need that right away. Pronto, Neal, all right? - Pronto. - Okay. Ass. (unsettling discordant music) (weapons firing on TV) Oh, gotcha, Miguel. (woman moaning on TV) Wait. This is just a bust. Stick-up bust. (woman whimpering on TV) Okay, okay, go through there. Okay. That is so funny. I was thinking the exact same thing about your profile. (Neal grunting) We are both from the same town. (Neal laughing) Oh, I know. Oh, we'd have a small wedding, like 50, 60. I don't, I have like too many friends. I'd probably have to like send out a lot of invites (laughs). Handsome, handsome, man. You got this. (foreboding thud) (tense foreboding music) - [Mom Voicemail] Hey, honey, hope you're doing well. Just wanted to call and check up on you. Haven't heard from you in a while. And I wanted to let you know that your cousin Dana is getting married next year. The whole family's excited. And the invitations will be going out next week. The engagement party will be next month. Hopefully, you can find a nice girl to take with you. - [Dad] Leave him alone. Neal, call your mother. She misses you. We love you. (foreboding thud) (minimal foreboding music) (minimal foreboding music continues) (minimal foreboding music continues) (vehicle approaching) (vehicle rumbling) (lively music) (horns honking) - What do you want from me? (cacophony of horns blaring) - What the fuck, bro? What the fuck are you doing? Stop fucking honking at me! Get outta the car, motherfucker! Come on you pussy. Faggot-ass bitch. Get outta the car, let's go! - No, no, him, him, him, him, him. - Let's fucking go, bro! - Them, them. (horns honking) - Come on, motherfucker. - I'm not doing. - Let's go. Get the fuck out. Come on!

(water spraying) - How's it going, Neal? - [Neal] Usual. - I bet. - So, I hear you're having a little trouble with the ladies lately. - No, who told you that? - Just the rumor I've heard on the streets. - Still, it's not true, so I don't, I don't know what you're talking about. - It's okay, bud. We've all been there. (water sloshing) But every once in a while, you get a little lonely. You want a little something something? - Okay, well. What do you do? - Ha. I get what daddy wants. Check this place out. You'll thank me later. - Mm, no, no. This is not my thing. - Trust me, Neal, you're gonna like it. - You've been here? - [Trevor] All the time. - What about your wife? - My wife! My wife hasn't touched my cock in five months. Let alone fuck me. So when I get a little backed up, I go and get a little something. Lemme tell ya, 80 bucks, best money I've ever spent. - [Neal] I don't know. - I'm telling ya, Neal. - It only costs you $80? - Best money ever spent. (Trevor cackling) Have a good weekend, pal.

My friend Trevor told me to come here for a good massage. - Trevor? I don't know a Trevor. You must go to wrong place. This is my home. - He gave me this card. (Olga laughing) - I am messing with you. Come inside, sweetheart. (door shutting) (lulling club music) Come here, darling. Come with me. (lulling club music continues) Come here, darling. This room. (mildly unsettling music) - Do I pay you now? (Olga chuckling) - No, I am not your girl. - What do I do? - Get undressed. Put your clothes on the bed. And Perla will babysit you in a few minutes. (mildly unsettling music continues) Oh, baby. It's okay. Don't be shy. And Perla will take great care of you. Get comfortable. - Hello. - Hi. Hi, how are you? - I'm good. You? - Okay. - Just okay? Don't worry. I'll take good care of you. That's what I'm here for. - Okay. - There goes that word again, "Okay." Just relax. Close your eyes. And relax. My name is Perla. - I'm Neal. (Neal giggling) Tickles. - Good. You like? Yes. Okay. Turn around, lay on your back. - Can I put my glasses on? I'd like to see you. - Okay.

Until we speak to you, please do not come to the office until this matter is resolved. If we don't hear from you within 24 hours, we may need to contact the authorities. - Oh my god. - Your co-workers are kinda shook by your behavior. So, give me a call when you can. - Oh fuck.

Your boss, your owner, what? - My owners, they got cameras everywhere, they're probably at your apartment right now! - What the fuck have I gotten myself into, Perla? - Just drive! - Okay, okay, okay, okay! (lively music continues) - Well, thank you, thank you. Thank you for getting me outta there, Neal. Just drive as fast as you can. Faster and far away. - [Officer Voicemail] Neal, this is Officer Avery. Highland Police Department. So we got the light camera footage. Okay, we got it on video. We got eyewitnesses, that you fled the scene, ran your plates, we got your information. We visited your home. We got a warrant out for ya. You need to come get in touch with me ASAP.

No really. - Mm-hm. - It's been a long time for me, and that was perfect. When was your first time? (Neal chuckling) What? - No. - Come on, tell me. - You don't wanna know. - [Perla] You tell me, I'll tell you. - See, that's the difference between men and women. We don't wanna know. - Come on, tell me. - Okay. But if I tell you, you have to answer a different question. Deal? - Anything you want. - I was 17 and it was out of pity. - [Perla] What do you mean pity? - You know. Pity. Her name was Sandy and she was basically the town slut. - [Perla] And? - And. So I walked in on my sister having sex with an older boy from down the block. - Get outta here. What are you doing? Get outta my room. - [Neal] I was shocked. I ran out of the house crying and screaming. And I remember I jumped on my bike. I rode up to the schoolyard. And the boy, somehow he caught up to me, and he said, "Neal, Neal, I just want you to know that "you know I really do love your sister. "Oh, I'll make it up to you, I'll make it up to you." I was like, how? And he said he would get me laid for the first time. (Perla giggling) - What? (Perla laughing) - Okay, ah, I see, I see where this is gonna go. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - No. Saying this. - Okay, I'm not gonna laugh. I'm not gonna laugh. Go ahead, continue. - [Neal] So, a few days later, I was walking down the street on my way home from school. And he jumps outta the woods. - What's up, bro? - He's like, come, come, come down this trail, Neal. - You ready? - So I do. And after a while, and there she is. This, this girl that I'd only heard stories about, written on like bathroom walls, about giving head to boys. (boys arguing indistinctly) And I remember trying to run away, tried to get out of there. And they grabbed me and they pushed me on top of her. And she pulled my pants down. - [Perla] And? - That's the day that I lost my virginity to Sandy Mancuso in front of a bunch of people. (Perla laughing) Please, please. - No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay, you probably have many women before those boys your age. You know, at least you were able to perform with an older girl. - I guess that's one way of looking at it, yeah. - Yeah. - [Neal] Okay, your turn. - No. - Your turn. - No- - Come on. You, you promised. I answered your question, come on, you answer- - Yeah, I did, I did. - Okay, so I wanna know where you came from and how you got here. - No, that's not important. - Mm-hm, it is to me. That's my question. - I, I was born in Dominican Republic. My parents got killed when I was very young. I can barely remember them, but I remember my mother's smile. My grandmother, she raised me until she passed a couple of years ago. I stay with friends, lived with my cousin, but I never had a steady place. I sold bread and, and fruits on the corner to help 'em out, you know, for putting up with me. Until one day, my cousin's friend, you know, she said that she can get us to America without papers. But that we needed passports. As long as we worked in her restaurant doing dishes and kitchen work, she will house us and pay us. - So, what happened? - Packed their bags and we left the following week. I knew that it was going to be dangerous, and I knew it was going to be rough, but I had no choice. I needed to come to America. When they transported us, they gave us this fussy drink to keep us calm in the van. I got very dizzy and I fell unconscious. Then when I woke up, I woke up in this room with other girls, but my cousin wasn't there. And this man came in. And they took our passports away. They told us that we work for them now. And then as time passed by, I was just giving massages, and then they told me that if I wanted to keep my house, that I needed to make more money. And that, and that I needed to please the customers. (Perla breathing shallowly) It wasn't supposed to go like that, Neal. I was supposed to- - It's okay, I know. (Perla crying) It's okay, you're safe. - You saved me. I owe you my life. I'm yours. I'm yours, Neal. - I'm a little confused about one thing. I just, if that's their business and they own the place, why are they robbing it? - I don't know. They do that all the time. They steal and they fight among themselves. And they rob the businesses. They think that the boss doesn't know. Maybe they're dirty cops, I, I don't know. They will never end until they find me. (foreboding music) - So what do we do? - We run. We run as far as we can. (foreboding music continues) Yeah. - Okay. (phone ringing) - Who is it? - I don't wanna pick it up. - Just pick it up. (static crackling) - Hello? - [Clerk 1] Hello, sir, this is your front desk wake-up call. Hope we didn't disturb you. You have an 11:00 AM checkout call. Have a great day. - I didn't order a wake-up call. - [Clerk 1] Hello, sir, this is your front desk wake-up call. Hope we didn't disturb you. You have an 11:00 AM check. - Fuck. (water splashing) (vehicle purring) (mellow Muzak) (register warbling) (birds chirping) (vehicle approaching slowly) (door opening) (door shutting) (vehicle approaching) - Hey, Trevor. Hello. Got a couple questions for you? It'll only take a moment. - Am I in trouble? - Nah, just get in the car, we'll talk about it. - No. - Just get in the car, Trevor, before we make you. - Is that a threat, chief? - No, it's a promise. (lively music) - They always run. (tires squealing) (Trevor yelling) (tires screeching) - What the fuck is this all about? - You seen your buddy Neal? - Seriously? This is about fucking Neal? - Answer the question. - No, why? - You haven't seen him? - No! - You heard about his little stunt? - What the fuck are you talking about? (flesh smacking) - Oh. - What the fuck, man? - Oh shit. - What the fuck are you doing? - You gonna cry? - What the fuck, man? Wait, wait a second. How, how did you know my name? Did you talk to Brian? - We know your name because it's on the credit card records at Smile Spa. And Olga told us that your friends with Neal, and that you work together. And, well, you know where this is going, right? - You should really use cash in places like that, Trevor. Now that that's out the way, where the fuck is Neal? - Listen guys, I swear to God, I don't know where the fuck Neal is. I saw him a couple of days ago. He was strangling my boss, causing a commotion at the office. And he ran outta there like a bat outta hell. I don't know where he is, honestly. - This Neal guy's getting better and better. - You haven't seen him since? - No. - What do you think? You think he's telling the truth? - I don't know. What about you? - You know, I actually do. - Okay. Guess what, Trevor, today is your lucky day. - Get the fuck outta the car. (metal unlatching) (engine starting) (door shutting) (door opening) - [Trevor] Neal, where are you? I just met two of your friends. They stopped me from walking into the office. Asking me all, all sorts of questions about you. Seems like you got yourself into something. Gimme a call when you get this. - [Perla] So what's next, what's the plan? - [Neal] Honestly, I think we should just drive. Maybe head south? - Okay. What about Mexico? We can go to Mexico. (Neal laughing) We'll be safe there, you'll love it there. - Yeah. - The food is great. - [Neal] We're not going to Mexico. You, you don't even have an ID. - [Perla] I'm just thinking, what else are we gonna do? (vehicle hissing) What happened? What's going on? - [Neal] I think the car just died. Fuck. Great, just fucking great! Fuck. Fuck. (birds chirping) Fuck, fuck. - What are we gonna do? - Now? We walk. (cheerful carefree music) (cheerful carefree music continues) (cheerful carefree music continues) I wonder where we are. - I don't know, but it sure is beautiful. - All right. We need to find a mechanic and then I need water. - Okay. (vehicle passing) (cheerful carefree music continues) (door squeaking) (mellow country music) - How's it going? - How you folks all doing? - Good, um, what town is this? - This is Pottsville. Don't you know where you are? - No, our car broke down a few miles back and we've just been walking forever. Do you happen to know if there's a mechanic nearby? - You're in pretty good luck. Down about a mile and a half out on the left-hand side is Rush Auto. West is one of the doggone best mechanics we got. He'll get you squared away. - That's good news, thank you very much. - Get everything you need? - Ma'am. - Ah. - You good? - Yeah, fine, I'm good. - Shit, do you have an ATM machine? - All the way in the back, all the way to the right. - Okay. - Hola. - How you doing? - I'm okay. - What, where are you from? - I'm from the Dominican Republic. - Dominican Republic, wow. Well, that ain't part of the United States, now is it? - No, it's not, ah, it's in the Caribbean. (machine beeping) - [Clerk 2] Pretty good. - Is, is your ATM machine working right now? I, I tried it a few times. It's just not happening. - Really? Well, somebody was just using it about five minutes ago right before you walked in! - Um, how much do I owe you for the, the waters, and. - [Clerk 2] Two waters and the gum, it's 4.50. - [Neal] Keep that, keep that change. - Thanks, you folks all have a nice day now. - Gracias. (door chimes jingling) (hinge squeaking) (bell dinging) (bell dinging) - Can I help you? - Have you seen these two? - No, can't say that I have. - You didn't even fucking look at it. (clerk sighing) - Do you want a room, or? - Listen to me, you fat fuck. If I wanted a room in this dirt-bag joint, I would've asked you for one, but I didn't. So I'm gonna ask you one more time, before I do get a room and stay here for awhile, and I don't think you're gonna like that. Have you seen these two? - Oh yeah, I, I actually, I, I think I have. - When? - Last night? - What room were they in? - Yeah, room 305. - Gimme the fucking key. - Ah, it's been cleaned already. - It's your lucky day 'cause now I am gonna stay. Fat bastard. - Fuck it, by the way, whatever happened to the girl you were with last night? - Oh, she was awesome. She was tall though. But you know me, I like a challenge. (hinge squeaking) - Yes, you do. - What about Trevor? - Trevor, what about Trevor? - [Bryant] Trevor thinking he could outrun you. - [Miller] Come on, you know he's not gonna outrun me. - Well, yeah, he, he was definitely gonna outrun me, that's why I used the. - [Miller] Who the fuck is this guy? - [Bryant] Is he looking over here? - You think he knows Neal? - He might know Neal. Who's in that room? - [Perla] Hey, what happened back there? Were you not able to get the money out? Were you even gonna tell me? - [Neal] I'm just hoping it was a glitch, okay? - [Perla] So how much cash do we have on now? - [Neal] A few hundred. All right, we're here. - [Perla] Thank God, my feet are killing me. (Perla sighing) (mellow cheerful music) - [Neal] Hello? - I'll be right with you. Oh boy. - Hey, Bobby, come finish this up, man. Take his break without telling me again. This fucking guy all the time. Hello, sorry to keep you waiting. What can I do for you? - Ah, we had a, a blowout a few miles back. I think it's probably like a gasket or something. - Oh, okay, a gasket. How far back, which road? - Five. - Three. Like four. - Two. - Five. - Three. Five, well, like, like a mile. - About- - Four, four, four four miles back on Route 52. - Okay, well, the reason why I ask, 'cause our tow is out overnight, picking up trucks outta state. And you need your car back here. - Um, do you have any other trucks available? - Mm, unfortunately not. Not for miles. But we can take care of you first thing in the morning to get you all squared away. - The, the problem is that my cousins are expecting us tonight. - Yeah. Do you have any motels around? - Mm, like trucks, not so many. But I, I think there's one about two miles north, right there on Tug Street. - What do you wanna do? What? - Can we go outside for a second? - Sure, think, sure, no problem. Take your time. - Okay. - Gracias. - Denada. - If we get a hotel for a night or two, that'll leave me with like a hundred fucking dollars. At this point, I don't know if my card's working right now. So how the fuck are we gonna pay for a, a hotel and then the tow, and the repairs of the car? Like this is so fucked, Perla, this is so fucked. - I know, I know, hang on. Let me think. Okay, so we get the hotel room with a card, and then we tell him we're gonna pay cash when we check out. But then we just get up early and leave. - Think that'll work? - It's worth a shot, we got nothing else. - Is he looking over at us? - Yes. - Ah, let's go. Um, so. Look, I couldn't help but overhear you guys talking about money issues. And believe me, I, I know I'm, I've been there before, so I understand. So how about this? Me and my family put you up for the night. We got a spare couch. And first thing in the morning, we'll take care- - No, no, no. - No, no, no, really, it's okay. We appreciate it. - Yeah, that's okay, we don't wanna impose. Thank you very much, but. - Truthfully, it's not a problem, honestly. - No, we'll get a hotel room, and then we'll see you in the morning. - I can drive you guys to the motel. 'Cause I know you guys been walking all day. - Mm, you don't wanna be driving us around all day. Plus you've already done so much for us already. Just, how about you give us your card and we'll see you in the morning. - Okay. Here, this is my card. And this is my cell number. Okay? So you call me in the morning? - [Neal] Yep. - And I'll take care of you. Deal? - Yeah, yep. - Deal. - Yeah. (news theme music) - [Reporter] We interrupt this broadcast for a special news bulletin. The suspect wanted in the (indistinct) shootout was last seen headed north on foot, on Route 52. Use caution if approaching. He is considered armed and dangerous. (foreboding music) (insects chirping) - What are you smiling about? - [Perla] You don't wanna know. - Tell me. - [Perla] Okay, promise you won't laugh. - [Neal] I won't laugh. - [Perla] Thinking about taking a shower and just getting on top of you. (vehicle approaching) - That's what you're thinking about? - Yes. - Everything going on, that's what's in your head? - Yes. - Hey, I heard you two need a ride. (vehicle rumbling) Y'all staying with me and my family tonight. - No, really, ah, just take us to the motel. - It's not negotiable. Plus, you don't wanna stay at the Castle Rock Inn. Better known as the Crack Rock Inn. Trust me, me and my family got you. As long as you don't mind a little adult fun. (foreboding music) (crickets chirping) (vehicle rumbling) (minimal carefree music) - Come on, grab hands. - Dear Lord, thank you for gracing us with our guests this evening and for guiding us through the daily struggles of our lives. We may not always be perfect, but we walk through this life with your guidance to shed all the evil and carry the light in which you provide to protect us from all the demons that tried to persuade our actions along the way. Lord, we thank you for this. Amen. Let's eat. (lively carefree music) Mona, this looks incredible. - [Speaker 3] Get yourself some chicken. (lively carefree music continues) - Baby, thank you. - Did an amazing job. - [West] Oh, thank you so much. So much I'm ready to slide. All right, Neal, don't hurt yourself on that biscuit. If you don't want it, bring it over. - I will. (group speaking softly) This is so good, thank you very much. (carefree music continues) (group speaking softly continues) - That's when I was telling this young man, you shouldn't even be driving that piece of shit. (all laughing) - That's hilarious. - The doors were falling off the hinges. Gimme a break. - Oh God. - What can I say? - So, how did you guys meet? In a whore house? (all laughing) - [Speaker 4] You two, seriously. - Come on, how did you meet? - I'm serious. - Oh. - [West] Killing me. - Really, how did you guys end up here? What happened before this? - We were on our way to a cousin's house when we broke down. - Yeah. - Oh. - Aw. Well, you're here with us tonight. I'm glad you're here. - Thank you. - So did your guys' cars break down too? (all laughing) No, seriously. Seriously, how do you guys know each other? It feels like family here. - Oh, well, we've known West for years. Just like you and Neal. I guess the universe just has a strange way of bringing people together. - Well, actually, my, my car did break down. (West laughing) - What? - Yeah. - You see, I knew it. - Yeah, took me about two weeks to work it off. Do all the things to get it put right, but pay it off and everything else. And I love it here. This place is amazing. Just never left. (man laughing) - You did a good job too. That's not happening to me. - You don't have to worry, Neal. I'm gonna get you running. - Thank you. - But how did you two meet? - Ah, we met through friends. Honestly, I was in a very abusive relationship and Neal helped me to get out. He took care of me afterwards. He's a great man. And we just have this connection that I never felt before. And when you know, you know. - [West] Good man, Neal. - Who's ready for dessert? - [West] Oh, goodness. - [Group] Mm. - [West] I got room for that. Thank you, baby, oh my Lord. - You guys enjoy your rest of your night. I'm going to bed. - Oh, thank you so much. - Thank you. - [West] Everything was wonderful. - Thank you. - Thank you. Everything was done nice. - Good night. - Good night. - [West] All right, keep it warm for me now. - [Mona] All right, good night. - So ah, is this the adult fun we were all talking about? - No, it's not, Neal. - You know, honestly, I thought you guys were gonna be swingers. (all laughing) - Swingers! - Actually, no. Do you wanna have some real adult fun? You should try the brownies. - [Neal] Why, what's in them? Are they pot brownies? - Mm, let's just say they're special brownies. Magic brownies. - Are you serious? You're fucking with me. She's fucking with me. She's fucking, is she serious? - She ain't lying. - [Perla] What, what's going on? - She's saying that there's magic mushrooms in those brownies. - There's only one way to find out. - I, I never done anything like that before. - It's called the leap of faith, Neal. Do you have faith? - I never considered myself a man of faith. (pensive somber music) (all laughing) - At'a boy! - He got faith! - [Speaker 3] At'a boy! - He got faith! - I do now, I do now. - Fuck it. - All right. - [Group] All right. - [Speaker 3] Yeah! (pensive somber music continues) (ethereal gentle music) - [Perla] Neal. (ethereal gentle music continues) - Whoa (laughs). Whoa. (Perla laughs) - You're deep. (Neal laughing) You're so white. (ethereal gentle music continues) - Yeah. Mm. - It's so beautiful. (ethereal gentle music continues) I can feel all the vibrations flowing through my body. (ethereal gentle music continues) Neal? - Mm? - I think I love you. (ethereal gentle music continues) (Neal laughing) - Really is amazing. (Neal laughing) - Wanna get some fresh air? (Neal laughing) - Let's go, let's go. (Neal yelling) (foreboding music) (flame igniting) (crickets chirping) where'd everyone go? - Everybody's here. Think some people are sleeping. - Where's Perla? - She's inside on the floor. - Were you with her? You wanna fuck her. - What? - You wanna fuck her. - Come on, dude. (Neal laughing) Dude. Here, smoke this. It'll make your high last longer. Smoke it. You like this high? Take it to another level. Yeah, cover the hole. Breathe it in. Right there. (Neal coughing) There you go. Yeah, see? Hit it again. - Huh? - Hit it again. (lighter igniting) (Neal coughing) - What (sobbing). What did you give me? what did you give me? You're trying to fuck her. - No, dude. (Neal sobbing) (menacing discordant music) (discordant music continues) - [Boss] Who'd ya kiss, Neal? Who'd ya kiss, Neal? Who'd ya kiss? - Shut up, shut up, how dare you talk to her like that. She's my fucking wife. She's my fucking wife Perla. (discordant music intensifying) Trying to fuck her? (Neal gasping and yelling) Stop it! (Neal laughing) (discordant music continues) (Neal squealing) (Neal yelling) (discordant music intensifying) (Neal retching) - Why wake up. Come on. (birds chirping) (Neal breathing rapidly) (keys jangling) Perla. Perla, Perla. - What? - Come on, wake up. Come on, we- - What the? - Wake up, get your stuff, come on, let's go. - Why? - Come on, just be quiet. Let's go. - No. (engine starting) (door slamming) What's going on? Neal. (engine puttering) (vehicle rumbling) What's going on? (wistful gentle music) - Where the fuck is everybody at? (wistful gentle music continues) Dear West, we cannot thank you enough for taking us in last night. - [Neal] For giving us warm food. - And great company. It saddens me to have to write this letter to you after all you've done. The last 48 hours have turned my world upside down. And I don't have enough time to explain. But I do know that I don't wanna get you involved. Take my car as payment for any inconveniences this may have caused you. The papers are in the glove box. Just one favor. Please wait to report this car stolen until tomorrow to give us enough time to get a headstart. I hope to see you again. Your friends. - [Neal] Neal and Perla. (West chuckling) - Motherfucker! (vehicle rumbling) - Where are we? When are you gonna tell me where we're going? Neal. - Okay, so do you remember last night when I went outside? Well, I got really sick. I puked. - Gross. - When I threw up, it felt like my insides were just ripping out of my body, ya know? And then, then this warm deep chill come over me. And, and I suddenly have this, this vision of my uncle giving me my first beer when I was a kid. And I thought maybe it wasn't some just random memory. Maybe it was a sign. You know? Like a message. - I don't get it. - Look, when I was a kid, my uncle would take my brother and I to his property upstate. - And we'd, you know, we'd fish, we'd hunt, and we'd, we would make moonshine. Sometimes we'd stay there for just weeks, ya know? Well, it became clear to me last night where we could go and hide out. - Are you serious right now? - Yeah, why? - You are serious. - What? - I mean, you, you steal this car, and then we leave West' house where we could stay longer, and then we just driving to some place that you haven't been in- - Perla, I have never been more sure about anything in my life, okay? - I don't know about this. We should've stayed. (foreboding music) - It's called a leap of faith, Perla. Do you have faith? (foreboding music continues) (vehicle approaching) (door shutting) (door opening) (metal tapping) (metal squeaking) (vehicle approaching) (doors closing) - [Bryant] Excuse me? Can we talk to you for a moment? - [Miller] Talk to you for a second. - I'm Detective Bryant. This is Detective Miller. Do you know who this car belongs to? - Nah, I can't say that I do. (foreboding music continues) - This car belongs to a suspect that was involved in an incident a few nights ago. - You know anything about that? - First I'm hearing about it. - Well, we got a tip that the car was spotted here and the same tip involved those suspects being last seen at your shop. Know anything about that? - Officer, we got a call from the Highway Department that this car right here was broken down with nobody present to have it towed to the yard. - Are you saying that Mr., What's his name? - Benneker. - Benneker is lying? - I'm not saying anything about anyone. I got called here, I'm just here doing my job. - Look, we know that you saw them. We know they came to your shop. And we know that you're lying. So just tell us where they are and you can go about your day. - All right, give me one sec. - Whoa, watch yourself. - Just going out to get my radio. Hey, Jared. Come in, Jared. - Jared here. - Yeah, Jared, I'm here with the car, man. Who called in for this pickup? - Hey, West, pickup number 5KK297 came down from Superintendent Milone late last night. (static hissing) - All right, thanks a lot, Jared. 10-4, I'll probably be in the lot about 20 minutes. - We'll be in touch. - You know where to find me. Fucking asshole. (engine revving) (foreboding music) (vehicle rumbling) - [Perla] This where your vision told us to come? - No, no, no! Oh, there was a cabin that was right here. - I'm sure- - Right fucking here. - There's no cabin here anymore. - Hello? - They're not gonna hear you. - Hello? - They're not gonna hear you! It's okay. You can just like, you know, sleep underneath the stars next to the fire. It'll be romantic. - I hope you're okay with this. - I've seen worse. - Okay, well then I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll go get supplies and then we'll just figure it out. Okay? - Okay. - I'll go to town. - I'll go with you. - No, no, no, no, no. I think you should just stay here. - Last time I checked you was the one wanted by the cops. I should go. - I'm sorry. What the fuck did you just say? - You was wanted by the cops? They don't see me. They saw you. - Are you fucking kidding me right now? - I go, you stay. - No, are you? I heard what you fucking said. Are you serious? Listen to me, okay? We're in this situation because of you. This whole thing is happening because of you. Do you understand that? Do you? I'm not, this is. - I can't believe you're saying that. (Neal mumbling) - [Neal] I don't know what I'm fucking doing right now. This is not- - Calm down! - No, this is all your fault! Okay, this is, everything is happening, it's because of you. I need to turn myself in. I, I, I should've just confessed and gone back. I, I, I- - Neal. - What? - Neal! - What, what? This is not who I am, Perla. This is not me. I'm not a bad person! I'm not a fucking criminal! - I, I didn't make you do anything. That was your decision, your fucking decisions that you must live with for the rest of your life, Neal. - I didn't do anything to you. - Are you? - Can you see with your fucking eyes? Can you see? You killed those men. - Was helping you. - You were helping yourself. You were helping your fucking self. - It's okay. - Get the fuck off me. - Don't go, just stay. I go. - No, you know you're not going anywhere. I- - Neal! - What? - Come. - I need to go and I need to explain myself. I need to confess what I've done. Don't you understand that? I'm sure if you were just to walk into a police station and confess what you've done, you can just suck some guy's dick. And they'd go, "Okay, Perla, you're good. "You're good to go." But not me, okay? It's different for me. Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious. - I show my face and I'm dead. They're gonna kill me. - That sounds like your problem, not mine. - Just stay here. - No, no. I, I need to explain myself. I need to- - Neal! - What? What, what the fuck do you want? - The last three days of my life have been the most amazing days that I've ever had. And I had nothing before I met you. And then you brought me something that I can look forward to. I mean, you brought me hope, Neal. Just please don't go, just stay. - Why, why? - Because I love you. Neal, don't go, please don't leave me. - Fuck off, fuck off, fuck this! - Neal, don't leave me, please don't leave me. (door shutting) This doesn't matter to you? (engine purring) Do I even matter to you, Neal? Neal, please don't abandon me! (Perla sobbing) Please don't go! (foreboding music) Please don't. (pensive somber music) (somber music turning defiant) (somber defiant music continues) (somber defiant music continues) (somber defiant music continues) (somber defiant music continues) (foreboding music) (foreboding music continues) (vehicle rumbling) (door shutting) (fire crackling) (foreboding music continues) (menacing music) (foreboding music continues) (fire crackling continues) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) - [Neal] I never thought this is how my life would turn out. How my meaningless, pathetic, little life would end up. All I ever wanted was just to feel loved. To have someone by my side. Someone to hold. But when I look back at myself, I think when we're kids, we could imagine the impossible. (Neal screaming) (aggressive discordant music) (aggressive discordant music continues) (ethereal gentle music) (ethereal gentle music continues) (ethereal gentle music continues) (somber foreboding music)
