Alright. I will. You book the tickets... I'll pack our bags -Deepu... -Hmmm Why aren't you crying? I did try when we were back home... I just couldn't What are you thinking? You're the therapist You tell me... It's a condition caused due to trauma Zero emotions She just thinks she's normal She just can't see what's wrong. I've never seen her cry... I haven't seen joy in her. How do I tell her that she's not normal? Do you need to? Chandu... Wanting to see your wife cry... Doesn't make you a bad person Took you 7 years to finally come see me again! My father's dead. Huh? You heard that right. My father is dead How? How much longer? Cremation is at noon. Deepu... What is this girl doing? Um... Deepu... Deepu... They're having their school's annual day program... School belongs to MLA sir We can't get them to stop the songs Deepu... Deepu... Get up Up Get up!

Deepu what is this? Why are you doing this Deepu? 'Ba' Huh? Third alphabet is 'Ba' Do you know the movie? Chantabbaai... I'm feeling bored! Paddu.. let's go. Deepu... Deepu...! Where are you going? Deepu... Deepu! I want to see his house Are you sure? I'll be back after I get his photo. Ok? Alright Don't over think it! I haven't gone mad It's all good. How have you been? Oh nothing much... Had to quit studying after I got married. Shifted to Gudivada. We were there for 3 years We shifted back recently... I met Roja last year She told me everything... Your husband seems like a gentleman He just let you go.. He knows everything. Really? You cannot hide away everything from your life partner... He saw my tattoo What did he say? I told him everything He lovingly consoled me... That's good... Why are we going to Krishna's house now? I'll tell you You want a soda? Taste's just the same Somethings never change -It's 2005! Why is your moron father still obsessing about colour? Don't you talk about my dad like that! Try to understand Deepu... My dad's black, naturally I am too... Hi I'm Deepthi I'm Deepika Murali.. So... You're lovers? Yes Are you going somewhere? Or just going away? We're eloping. Stay quite! Careful... What's the issue? We've been in love since college Her parents aren't ok with it... They found another groom for her American groom? No. Australia. Oh it's all the same in the end. Did they tell you that he has a six figure salary, He's fair And you're life's set if you marry him? Listen They must be the groom's relatives Let's go No no... Your story is similar to mine. This happened to you too? This happens to almost everybody. Deepu... What did you do? Listen to me.. Just let it go... You're here already...? Ya ya... You're going to do this everyday? I have to uncle... Are you getting enough sleep? Ya ya.. Wash them properly or they'll start stinking If you keep up your milk route everyday Won't you be late for your classes? No worries, this college belongs to my uncle! Quit pulling my leg. I'm a watchman, not the principal. Did you eat anything? I did. What about you? I will. Take care of the cans. I'll pick them up in the evening. Alright Study hard son. Remember this uncle. This college will always remember Jaya Krishna! Engineering is not a joke Is that so? Of course. Until last year, You needed a rank below 10,000 for a seat... The new CM has given permission for new colleges now. So many colleges have mushroomed up. That's why our boy got a nice seat. Everything happens for a reason. The boy found a good college. You have no clue really... Kittu... You must study hard and come up in life. Oh I will... I don't have knee pains like you... What is that tone? Respect your elders Is that how you talk to your uncle? Dump your rubbish elsewhere then... Not at my house. I'm telling this for your sake only... If you don't study now, All that you've worked for till now will be wasted. Day old food might be useless to us. Feed it to cattle and they'll happily eat it up. Dirty water may not quench our thirst. But it can put out a fire. Nothing in this world goes waste uncle... Everything can be used one way or another. You've learned to be argumentative boy! Uncle, After 10 years, When I've achieved something in life, You will want to take a picture with me. Then my father will inform you that I'm not at all free... What are you laughing at? Don't you have any work to do? Come on... -See you later -Ya.. Sister-in-law... Coffee...! It will cost you. How much? 5 minutes... -Is he still getting ready? No chance! His romance with the mirror will never end We woke up at the same time I got ready, cleaned the house and even finished cooking breakfast. He's not yet done... People say women spend too much time in front of the mirror... Somehow he manages to make us feel normal... Look.. Look... -Listen, -Hmm If you hadn't quit your government job to marry my brother, You could have gone jogging instead of him... Oh forget about that... Where does he go jogging everyday? I haven't been able to figure it out yet. Maybe he isn't going jogging? Maybe he's going somewhere else... Don't you ever doubt him? No way. He can go to any lengths to maintain his looks. Hey... How are you brother? Did your father leave for the office? He went to the station long back. Walk with me... I heard you're involved in some love affair... Did you tell your father? I couldn't brother... I'm not finding the courage to tell him. What am I for? You want me to tell him? -Really? -Hmmm What's the boy's name? Abhi... Abhiram. Tell me about him... He's our temple priest's son... Oh now I see... That's why you're at the temple everyday... Devotion is an added benefit to love apparently... So the priest's son you say... Doesn't seem favorable to me... Every body gets half a coconut, This boy probably gets just an extra half... Dad will not agree... Is he educated? Yes. He's a degree holder. Oh... Degree is it? Degree holders are very common nowadays. Very hard to convince your dad... Any other qualifications? He's the captain of our district cricket team. Cricket! Cricket... Sport... Not a standard job... Anything else? He'll get a job in the sports quota. He's preparing for next month's tournament. He will definitely do well. Then we can talk to dad about him... He may find a job in the handicapped quota... But your dad may not yet agree to this... No no.. you're mistaken. He's the captain of his cricket team. He's not handicapped. No dear... I'm sure. He is indeed handicapped. No chance brother... What do you know? I broke his hand. I should know. You met him yesterday in the morning. I saw him last night. Take him anywhere you want in the world... His hand will remain useless now. It's my guarantee. Ok? You cannot find another boy as good as him... Please brother... My dear, In the year 1969, a man named Neil Armstrong, Underwent a lot of struggle, to set foot on the moon. But you kids still believe sky is the limit... You are happy with the sky... We want you to have the stars. And that's why you MUST listen to your elders... Marry the guy your dad chose for you. All will be well. Thank you sir. You managed to scare some sense into my daughter. Mr Ramesh, A guy with a girl child, and a guy standing on a beach like this, Are very much alike. You think that the water is comes in to coolly wash our feet... But without you even noticing, The water easily steals the sand beneath our feet. These wastrel guys these days, Show the sweet illusion of love And steal our girls away. Yes sir. The sea, The trees, Bushes, Kids jump the moment they see these. Yes sir. Even this beach is a popular lovers' spot. We must protect our nature at all costs. We will. Keep an eye on this place. Ok sir. Lift it up... Down a bit... Up Smile Heh... What is that expression? How does it look? You look like a ghost whisperer... Hang on... I'm coming. Little to the right... Look down... Down... Smile Mouth closed... You childish F.... Bro... What are you saying? Nothing... I said you look like a cute little puppy... It's just in a different language... Smile now... Nobody can light a frame like I do... You sure it's going to be a decent picture? When you die... This will be the picture used at your memorial! Ask me then if it's decent... I'll refund your money otherwise... Samuel Naidu... Samuel Naidu Balu... Your dad isn't in yet? No.. Why? Oh nothing... Our police photographer has jaundice... Need you dad to come click a few pictures Hey... I can do that for you... You? Do you need my dad or the pictures...? Ok... Let's go. Hang on... Uncle... Uncle... Am I supposed to get on this now? And pedal it too... Come on... Hold this... Couldn't you have brought the jeep? I will... Do some dumb thing and get caught You can then ride along in the jeep. You will never get that chance... Why is he so cranky always? Hello sir. How did it happen? He drank pesticide & hung himself... Hanging didn't work... Pesticide did... I'm scared of dead bodies... I can't take this picture. -Let me go... -Wait... wait... We don't have another photographer... This needs to go to press So my pictures will be in the papers...? Yes... 50 rupees... 30... Do I get picture credits at least? You know.. I think this might be a murder... I'll give you credit for that... Do it for free... No thanks... Just buy me a soda on our way back... Get on with it... The light on this guy is bad... Shut up man... His photo is going to be in the paper tomorrow... Did he ever imagine that would happen in his life? This way... Turn... Hey... Why were you trying to light up the dead guy dumbo? Be thankful he didn't throw some powder on the dead guy... You should have carried him to your studio to take proper pictures... Think this is funny? Right from childhood I always favored you, Because you're my best friend... That was my mistake... Useless fellows.... [Humming the hymns] Wait a minute... We haven't practiced the climax portion of the song.... Ya... I'll take care of that... I'll be leading that section. Oh... But I thought I was playing the goddess... You? I've been doing this since I was 12 But nobody told us about this... We thought Deepthi would play the goddess' part better... No no... I have to do it... Everybody I know says I look good in the costume... Then... Let's do a look test to decide. Ya... Let's do that. You go first... I'll show you the best later... Movies are so misleading man... There isn't one pretty girl in our college True... Not even one... But there's this girl, Padma, in electronics... Her eyes man... They're as bright as a 100 candles... Wow... You tollbooth make a great pair Just like watching a black & white movie... No no... Gulab jamun... Rasagulla... A sweet love story... Don't crack jokes on me man... I'm warning you... And you... Do you like someone? You know Sunitha from our class? Wait... Her? Do you know her EAMCET rank? Have you heard her speak English? Feels like she was born to a Britisher... Imagine us speaking English... Feels like we are trying to take revenge on the Britishers... So... You...? That girl...? Lets see you speak in English for a minute... Stop it! That is your range... The moment you see a girl is when it rises... What is 'it'? Hairs on your body... -Thumps or bumps it's called... -Goodpumps... Yes... Goodpumps... Goodpumps... That... That's the feeling. Where's the matchbox man? Matchbox... Let's get it from the terrace... From where the seniors smoke... Let's bring that one... True... Now go get it... No way man... You're the closest to the terrace... Go get it... There.. There... Don't let the seniors see you.. You'll be ragged... Need to tolerate those guys until the freshers party... It's just a little ragging man... Nobody will object until the freshers party... Where's the matchbox? The matchbox... Where did you put it? After you go home... Make sure to ward off any evil eyes... Why are you here? I came for you... You never hang out here.. Except when my mom makes prawn curry... Why are you here so much nowadays? Everybody has four friends in life... One who teaches you habits... One who loans you money when in need, One who grows along with you, -And then... -It's too tight let it be... The one who helps with our love affair... I see all 4 of them in you Balu... Hey! Doesn't matter how much you scrub... Buffaloes don't turn into oxes... Do something useful... BTW, I have a doubt... Did you love him too, then? Nothing like that... But he did catch my eye... But I did hear a lot about him... He delivered milk to homes before coming to college everyday... I used to look for him soon as I entered the college... Milk cans outside the watchman's quarters meant that, Krishna was in college that day. -So you were interested...? -Actually... Look boy... Just like guy are addicted to smoking & drinking... Girls have an addiction too...? You know? No If we catch a guy looking at us... All we're worried about is if they're still looking at us... Hate when that happens.... -You tell me sister... -Sister? Did he propose to you? He would've... But... Unfortunately... Dude! Why did you bring her to the college man? Just 5 minutes man... Hold on... Listen to me... Are any students leaving the campus in class hours? No sir.. Keep an eye on the fields behind the college... Ok sir... Because of Liquor prohibition, Kids are mixing tablets in cool drinks and drinking them.. Childish idiots. That farmer keeps complaining to me... I will tell them sir... Also, Some of there are smoking on the terrace... One of our lecturers complained to me... Sir, I'll make sure it doesn't happen again... What will you make sure? How I do I know more about this than you? Sir... -Come let's go up... -Sir... Which year? Second year sir.... What are you dong here? We came for the duster sir... -What? -Duster... You're here for the duster are you... morons? Sir... Look at that properly.... Sorry sir... You... Bring your parents tomorrow... What's happening here? I was talking to my girlfriend sir... Girlfriend? Is this a college or a public park? Please sir.. Sir... -Come on... -Sir.. Please no! Sir.. Insulting me in front of everyone, like this, It's just wrong... I will have to call my dad... Oh..? Standing here is humiliating you? Ok... Sit down... Sir..? SIT DOWN! Why are you sitting down? Up... Get up! Sit on this chair Sir...? Sit on this chair for 5 minutes... I'll let you leave... Relax... You said 5 minutes... You made me sit for nearly 15... This Si cheating sir... 15 minutes? Do you know how long you really stood? 2 minutes and 15 seconds... The punishments will only get worse from here... Go! Go to your classes! The whole college is talking about one thing only... Why did that old giraffe humiliate you publicly...? Turning into a good guy takes time... Becoming a hero is easy... You just need a fool to pick on... I need a bloody lab monkey... The whole deal is... Neither the public nor the monkey should know... That I'm playing them... You need to go catch such monkeys They will not come looking for you... Bro... You... Get lost man... Urgent bro.. I'll be out right away Hey... Don't you get it? Get lost man... I won't disturb you bro... Please understand. Who's you bro here? Were you born to my dad or something? Can't you hold it in? Get lost! Sorry sir... We need a coward like him... Why just 'like' him...? -How about him? -Right... We found our black monkey... Where are the others? They're on their way... What is this...? We did one good show for the fresher's party... They want us to do the opening act at every event now... This is too much... I think we need to keep driving these functions up from now... No way things move along without us... Moreover, our place is very much secure... Let's head to the canteen after practice... I want a limca... Why do you have that? That's mine... The lead dancer wears red... Yes... The lead dancer wears red... You rascal! You bloody blacky wastrel... -How dare you harass girls! -Sir I really didn't do it on purpose -Eh come on... -I swear.. someone pushed me -Keep walking! -Everyone is looking at us... Why would I do something like this? Blacky rascal! Everyone is watching... Please let it go.... I really didn't... Please bro... Blacky wastrel... How dare you tease girls? How dare you tease girls... You dare tease girls? Someone pushed me... I didn't go in on purpose... Please bro... Don't hit me... Please bro... I'm not someone like that... Out of my way! Stop it... Dharma stop! I believe our college is a temple... Lovers may enter this temple sometimes... Eve-teasing rogues like this one should not... Just look at him... Him and his stupid face... If you punish him.. he will be wary next time And try to not get caught... But when someone like me reacts... He will think twice before doing something wrong again... If you still think I did something wrong... Please forgive me... Hey! Stop that song first! Dude... Think your uncle told your dad already? No he won't... I begged him not to. That's why I brought him to your room instead of home... I think those guys planned to create a scene...This seems like a grudge What happened to you dude? You didn't notice... He kept on calling me 'Blacky' repeatedly... Does that mean fair looking guys can never do anything wrong? Skin colour doesn't matter... A mistake is a mistake... Are you sad because he called you 'Blacky'? -Or that he beat you for no reason? -It wasn't my fault dude... What's in skin colour anyway...? A good heart is all you need... Don't talk rubbish... If a good heart was just enough Why do you have that tube in your room? Buddy... I heard the seniors talking today.... Dharma did this on purpose to humiliate you... That rascal! I thought such wastrels exist only in cinemas... They are real then.... Fiction is inspired from fact dude... Look dude... Don't go seeking revenge and hitting them or something... You're not Chiranjeevi to pull it off... I forbid you! -Hmmm. -I'll whack you! What do you mean 'Hmm'? Swear on me.... Why will I go hit him man? Swear that you won't hit anybody... You over-excited moron! If you don't mind, can I ask you something? Did you love someone in college or something? Go to sleep Deepu... You have exams. Did someone manage to impress you? Impressing is easy... Sticking around through everything is the hard part... Gotcha! Tell me... Have you heard of the love bug? What do you think is the lifespan of an ant...? 45 days? 15 years... Yet we kill that poor ant in fraction of seconds.... Love can be like that some times... Only the ant knows the pain of getting crushed Do you feel bad about it now? Are you happy with my brother? Little fights are common in any marriage... Some end with words... Some lead to the belt... At night, they need us again... Cigarette stench, Alcohol, You need to put up with it all... Everything's back to normal in the morning. Maybe this wouldn't happen if we actually love the guy we marry... Rubbish.. Love or arranged marriage, Once you're married, it's all the same... With so many issues in a marriage... The act of marrying someone shouldn't become too much of a bother... That's why... A few sacrifices need to be done Is it easy to forget? Not at all... But we don't even get the time to think about it... With guys... After their love fails and until they marry someone else, They drink & narrate their stories to anyone who'd listen... Their friends console them... Doesn't work that way with us... By the time we even realise that our love failed... We're already being married off... Our friends come congratulate us... Thinking about another man once you're married is a 'sin' too... Naturally... Moreover, It's always males like this who make movies about themselves... Our stories sadly remain unheard... Ok... one last question... According to you, What is love? Making sure the person we love, is put beyond above anything else imaginable is what true love means... Go to sleep now... Good morning sir... Name? Jay Krishna sir... Mechanical branch Your wounds healed ok? I'm fine sir... I'll heal. These girls told me everything... Sometimes, for no fault of ours, we keep getting hurt. People call it an accident. Just think of this as an accident and forget it. Krishna... The walls of this office room Have heard me issuing warnings... For the first time, I'm giving you an assurance of safety instead Don't worry about it... Ok? Thank you sir... BTW, You gave a speech about higher studies in your 1st year I heard it & liked it. I like your confidence... I will ask you to make a speech at one of the upcoming events... -Ok? -Ok sir... You people can leave now... Krishna... Jaya Krishna.. What did we do to you? Why are you avoiding us? We even cleared your name with the principal... This behavior is hurtful Humiliation in front of 100 people, Cannot be forgotten with a small apology in front of a few people. This is my reputation here... Good things happen to good people. Please tell your philosophies elsewhere No need... Don't say this to anyone. Your guy seems to be a little too soft... Takes time... Every cocoon transforms into a beautiful butterfly... Just takes a little time. Duryodhana.. Dirty...! You're not Bhima, You're Jambavan Alright I wasn't allowed to fully present my talents all these days... It is finally time, For everyone to talk about my performance Doesn't matter what you do, people will only talk about me Jambavan is an important character too. People will talk about me! Petrol & Diesel are sold together, but its still called a Petrol Bunk... Look, O Sugriva, at his sudden witty retorts... Our once-upon-a-time character actor is suddenly very chirpy because he's finally doing the main character... You're right... He thinks he's the hero now... Dude I'm not the protagonist, just a plot element... Ya ya... I can see that... Anyway, it's time to practice. Come on. Ready? Ready. -Shall we? -Ya... Hanuma... Yes Jamba... You're going to Lanka to rescue Sita Devi... Be careful Definitely... The moment you're in any trouble Our Vanarasena, Will burst through darkness to come to your aid. I'm blessed Jamba! Hey Ravana! Our man is on his way... He will come smash your Stick! Hey! What? That's what the dialogue was man! What the hell man... Everything you say sounds like a cuss word. -What the hell man.... -Balu... -Come here -Where're you going? We're late. Balu... Why are you swearing so much in this getup dude? Fine. I won't say it again. Never use this language again man... People start looking down on you... Sorry dude. If I bother you so much... People have been complaining to me I can't talk without cussing dude! Sorry I just can't... Can't you do it for me? I might be able to manage without eating, But I cannot survive without cussing No. I need you to swear on me... Fine... I'll teach you a hack If you ever feel like cussing again, Stop the cuss word mid way and shift to a similar sounding word This seems like it could work. Why are these guys here? These guys are performing before us tomorrow... Hey! You... Can't you see a senior is calling? Come here We were just calling you a black monkey for fun Now you dressed up as one. Only the snout is missing... Curry point. Ya look like you work there... Why did you quit? Hey! We're Britishers man. Oh that's what the costume was? Must be a British catering service... Bro... Just let it be... I will kill you Kittu... Come here... Dude! What's wrong with you? I'm controlling my anger. Why? I promised you that I won't hit them... Look at me... Stop! The promise, Hit them now...! You're a dead man... Why does he want another beating? How dare you hit a senior man! Dude! Don't touch him until the power returns, I want him to clearly see our faces when it happens Ok Why isn't anyone wearing the monkey snouts? Snouts aren't important It's clobbering time. Hanuma... Yes Jamba... The time to break some sticks is finally here! "Blacky wastrel" Am i? You British beggar! That was a nice beating... Is this yours? You useless piece of crap. Dharma, The moment we stop caring about your age, There's no more senior & junior. If you poke our ego, Don't even care who you are... Nonsense! Him & I are the same? I come to college in my own car, He roams around selling milk on a cycle every morning, We're the same? Get lot you useless piece of crap. True, You're here because your father has money to throw away for you, I'm here because of my rank & merit. How can we be the same? No way... You cannot afford to buy even a matchbox on your own... -What a crappy life man! -Hey! Don't bring my father into this.... Your dad shouldn't have gone home that night... Kittu... What are you saying? You asked me to stop cussing. What is this? His dad really wasn’t home that night.. -You! No no guys, calm down. His dad is great. I know. He's taking care of some random neighbor’s kid. -His dad really is great... -Look, I'm warning you... Dharma.. Wards can wars they say... But then imagine having a war of words... Just like this isn't it? You can't even pluck a single hair from my head... Kittu wait... My turn now. Go on... He's decent so he spoke about hair on your head. You know well what I would call you.... I.... I'm hungry man... Lets go. Hey Krishna! You'll have it soon... -Why? Don't you? How many more times will you get trolled? Hello... Hi Did you check the first year results? What's your percentage? 71% I got 91% Very nice... Was it attendance? No... Percentage So... I topped the college I want to give a small treat. Why don't you come... I will... It's at 5 in the evening. Right after college. Don't forget. -You must come. Ok? bye -Ok Why didn't you come yesterday? Our buffalo delivered a baby... I stayed back with her for moral support. I couldn't make it. Sorry... Ok. Come to the canteen for lunch today. Party. For you... I will be there.... Why are you playing with me? How did you know I'd be here? Your cycle Tyre is punctured, Where else would you go? How did you know about my cycle? Because I punctured your damn cycle Tyre. You can simply say so if you do not wish to come. But what you're doing is humiliating... Why don't you say a word? I know.. You've been behind me since a year I thought you were a nice guy, You weren't harassing me like those stupid move guys, I had a good opinion on you. I saved you with the principal thing... Forget about thanking me... You threw an arrogant look at me... I hoped to talk and clear it up with you, That's why the party... But you didn't show... I asked you to meet me in the canteen today, You don't even care about it... I haven't even eaten anything yet. Learn to respect other people's feelings I had a little sympathy on you... But you needed to show off... Wait... Hang on... I've been watching from so long... You have been jabbering... I have to care for your sympathies? Who the hell asked for your sympathies? Sympathy is for beggars and handicapped people, That's not the feeling I'm interested in. You assumed I'm dying to talk to you? Do I look like a beggar? What do you think of me? Tell me this.. Do I need to come running the moment you call? What's with the demands? Canteen, Party... Imagine this in reverse, a guy doing it to a girl... He'd have been thrown in jail Are you crying? Then what was that till now? That wasn't you! Oh what then, Do you know how I planned to meet you for the first time? Sand, Sea, Wind, And now, Dirt, Bus stop... You know your birthday banner, The one your parents had printed... What happened to it? -Got lost! -Your face! Sorry I have it in my home. Considering an average person's memory power, It's hard to remember faces other than those of your parents. I didn't want to forget your face That's why I stole that banner for myself Please forgive me And about the thanks... Who do you think you're favoring? If you had talked when Dharma was hitting me, At least my reputation would've been intact. My face cannot show expressions properly... You thought I was angry? I wasn't... Just upset When you do love me, What's your problem saying it aloud? A dark guy like loving a fair girl like you, Even friends would make fun of me... One guy says Black & White, One guy says Gulab Jamun Rasagulla, And some say, "In your dreams bit..." Sorry... I shouldn't be swearing in front of girls Everybody starts showing extreme sarcasm... Considering my confidence levels, All this is not happening What am I to do then? I'll just stay far away... And look at you from a distance. My life... is just like that street light there, or a bulb in some cinema theater... It just exists. There is no light. It isn't even in my control I don't want your sympathies... That's why I avoided meeting you... I want to see you over there... I must look at you from here You please stay there. That's all.. nothing mor- I love you. True I love you If you like me too, Lets meet at the beach like you wanted This Sunday Come to Peddapatnam beach Sharp 10 AM Take your time & think about it You found a nice spot... What are you doing? You're cleaning that place for me? We're at the beach. It's already sand... Sorry sorry... It's alright What are you looking at? I just realised something... I finally get why poets romanticize the Sea & the skies... -Ya... -Just wow... -You seem to be busy. I'll go... -Sorry sorry.. Please stay Tell me... What? I need to say something first right... Right... What's your full name? Indukuri Deepthi Aitham Jaya Krishna Jaya Krishna... Tell me about your family Me, -My dad, -Hang on... hang on... I had to drive all the way here... -Do you mind walking for a bit...? -No no... Lets... What were we talking about...? Ya... Me, My dad, My Lakshmi Two buffaloes, And one cow. Who's Lakshmi? My pet calf... My mother passed away in 1992 I named the calf Lakshmi in her memory... Oh... It's alright Do you resemble your mother? I would have been beautiful if that was the case... Was your mother so beautiful? She was... Hmmm... Alright... Describe how beautiful your mother is, Without any poetic comparisons with the sky or sea... Imagine you're crying... but suddenly burst out laughing for a joke I told, That's how beautiful she was Comparison with a woman's smile... Is routine! Even so, It's the second most purest thing in the world What's the first then? A man's tears... If you don't mind, I need to ask you something... Come on... Can you please stop being so formal? Only after the wedding... Oh I see... Alright... Do you really love me? Wait a minute. What did you think I meant? Why did I come so far if I didn't love you... Sorry sorry... Calm down... Anyway, Do you love me? Please don't even ask something like that... It's not right. Don't ever say that. Just one more thing... So now we know that we love each other, I thought we need to have a small rule, What's that? Let's not tell anybody else that we love each other. Why so? The whole college thinks you're as beautiful as a movie star. People even say that you deserve a husband as handsome as Akkineni Nagarjuna If those people find out, then everyone will think they have a chance..... I mean... That's the way people think... Why? Can't you tell them to back off? Are you a coward? I can probably explain to a couple of people, We are sitting among a herd of mindless sheep, Going against them will only lead to a useless stampede... It's better to just let them be..... What if someone says something after we're married... Will you leave me? Actually... After college, when I get a good job, Getting married then, Would not attract so much negativity... Alright... Since this is the first thing you asked of me... I will agree to this So... Would you have agreed to anything I asked? Didn't you just say "Only after marriage"? You're a real secret player man... Look at you blushing... See you later then... And BTW, Don't keep showing up at my uncle's place like that.... What if somebody sees us? "Don't talk in college" "Don't come to my place" How the hell are we supposed to talk then? She's angry... Ok. If we want something with all our heart, It will definitely find a way to us... Tomorrow afternoon... Sharp at 1 O'Clock Window... Don't forget Where's your dad? Gone to get fodder Come on... Don't be shy... I'm scared... You'll be fine... Don't worry... Why's the buffalo's baby tied over here? Sit down This is not a buffalo. Its a cow. This cow's calf in fact... Black cat, Black cobra, Black crow, Black always signifies bad for some reason But the only being that's worshipped because it's black, Is this cow... This is my Lakshmi. This little bit is our field My mother used to go and sell this corn in the market Those were her savings You know the popular expression, "Money doesn't grow on trees" It does in our house We are very rich My mother She observes all our goings & doings everyday If we ever forget to eat food or something... She gets angry You have her exact eyes This is my small kingdom Our house burned down in a freak fire a few years ago. Dad & I managed to put up this hut just for the both of us This house only has place for two people I always thought This place will be crowded when a third person entered... But now I know... How beautiful it will become You're the queen here now You're fine with this? Hello Mr Bala Yesu... Yes.. Hello... You're dad isn't here? No... why? Exactly what I want I need a nice colour photo clicked Passport 20rs, full photo 40rs Come back after 4 days to pick them up... I'm too busy right now... Yo Balu... I smell something burning man... It's from inside my pant man! Get lost! What happened man? I will kill you. Just get lost! What's your problem man? I will F... F... F... Oh my god promise... F...? F...? I will Finish you! Go roam around with her Oho... You had to use my home to stalk her? You dirty cheat! Listen Balu.... Lets discuss it over a soda How did you find out man? Did you see something at the cinema hall? That means you're going to movies together? Is this a two-sided affair? I shouldn't have said that... Did you see something at the beach? Beach? You don't have the guts to skip class with me... You went to the beach with her? How else did you find out? I took your book home instead of mine yesterday... So? First page of a guy's book can tell you his name But the last page of a guy's book will tell you the name of his lover. Aren't you even a little embarrassed? Just to achieve 'M' in flames, You almost shredded your name "Jaya" It seems... Jai... Krish... Nonsense You son of sea... Don't be like that dude... I thought people would make fun of us if they found out... That's why we have this privacy rule. What's the point if she's so shy? Why is she already trying to control you? No no... The rules were mine. I don't want to inconvenience her... Fine... But when are you introducing her to me? Dude she's your neighbour man! But her mom & mine have an ongoing rivalry... Their god is shepherd of Gokul And our god is the shepherd of Jerusalem But don't both your houses eat lambs on Sundays? That's what I keep telling them. But no one listens... So much ego man... Neither of us is ready to let it go... When are you introducing her to me? Why are you so excited for this dude? Imagine the most beautiful girl in the college Thinks of me as her brother & friend. Now wouldn't that be something... BTW... I almost forgot... She has an older brother. His name is Ramaraju He might look decent on the outside But he is rotten to his core... As if that wasn't enough, This new movie called 'Hitler' Has dredged up a lot of brotherly emotions If they do find out about your affair, That'll be you... Aaah... Well she said that's gonna be her problem... I'll bring her to meet you next Sunday. Ok... I'll click your picture... -It's free for you... -Thanks man! Listen, This is the first picture you're clicking for me.... It is.. isn't it..? Make sure it's good. Don't worry. I'll rock it. Lift it up a little... Not so much.. Down down... Ya.. Smile 1... 2... 3... Why did it black out? Didn't you say you smelled something burning earlier? That was this light What about the photo? I'll take care of that. No problem. You sure? Fine Hello... Over. Hello... Can you hear me? Over. Yes tell me. Over. Lets meet at the bridge this Sunday I'll introduce my friend Yesu to you. Over. Wait... what? Didn't you say we had to keep it a secret? Over! He found out about us anyway... I got caught... It's alright. He's my best friend. Over. Oh my Kodak camera! What a setup! Over! Oh crap! "We" will come? Who the hell is "We"? Over. Me and my friend. Over. Aaargh! Didn't I ask you not to tell anyone? You girls... Are too Over! Hey! Don't scold me! She found out on her own too... Don't overact. Over! Oh.. You too...? Over Can you see how many fingers? I will whack you... Don't make lame jokes. I lost my specs.... This is a nice place you found man... The milk guy must know every road. Did you bring my photo? What's the photo for? She wanted a photo of mine to keep in her book. She may also need to show it to her parents... This one is good for the books. We'll plan another picture for her parents... I'll get you ready and click another one. Lemme see this one... They're here. Come lets go Style? What are the glasses for? These glasses make the one we love appear even more beautiful Oh wow! Now tell the truth. Did you see how fair she is? -Yes yes... -She's shining a lot more under the sun. Now once I put on these specs, Her color goes down, My confidence levels grow up! What rubbish Lemme see... Balu this is Yesu... Pch... -Deepthi, this is Balu. -Hi -I am Bala Yesu. -Hi Mr Balu Child Christ... -Hi.. -Hello... Hi... One minute... Come here What is it? I think I like that Padma dude! -Hey! -Why? Why is it wrong only for me? It's not that... I get it.. This is because I am fat right? No no, No way! I mean.. Yes.. That's why... Is that all? Technology is so advanced now... Someone will copy blood donation & create fat donation. I will then donate my fat to her Then we will become made for each other So you will never reduce weight... No chance! My mom thinks I'm handsome just the way I am... Fine... What do we do now? Give us space to talk privately for a bit... Hey! We just met her. She will whack us both if we ask to speak privately... Then lets do one thing, You both go speak privately, Then I can be alone with her here... Dude! Come lets go... -Can we go over there to talk? -Alright Take care paddu... Ms Padma... Please come.. Take a bridge... Come... Near Nobel college... You? Ya... Is it? 'Twas the year 1996, Just like the beginning of a hit Rom-com movie, I used to keep getting letters... She doesn't know how I look, I don't know how she looks... We fell in love with each other's love letters... Whenever my parents were out of town, She'd write that she wanted to come home. I used to clean the house and wait for her. -But she never came. -Why? This same thing happened a few more times... Then finally one day I got it, It was my dad writing those letters to me... He wanted me to clean up the house when they were out of town. None of us really know.... What else is new? -I have to show you something... -Me too... You go first... Few more jokes and she will be mine... Actually, one day at the church... Wait.. Hang on... Someone died... So sad.. isn't it? Wait a sec! It's a body... Someone died... Body? Wonder what Balu is going through right now... Mr Bala Yesu... Balu... Ok... Show me now... You asked me for a photo right... I thought I had it with me.. -I think I forgot it... -oh no.... Don't worry about it... Now my turn to show you something... Know what it is? Did you get a tattoo done? Calm down... Why are you shouting? I really wanted to do this... My god... What's the need for this stupidity? Isn't it good? What good is there in this..? -Shouldn't have gotten the tattoo done.. -Why are you angry with me now? I'll talk to you later... Balu... Balu... Balu... Hey! What....?! Done already? Nothing's done... Lets just go. -She got a tattoo man! -Tattoo? Tattoo? Deepthi... Bye! Padma... Bye! Are you coming or should I say bye to you too? Bye... From that day we didn't go way out of town to meet. Because we now had two amazing people standing guard for us... Are you still mad at me? I'm not mad at you... What if your parents find out? Who's gonna check there? The only one who gets to see it is my husband Just one more year... We'll pass out with good marks I'll get a nice job, Come home and talk to your parents Kannayya... Stop being so formal please... It will take some time... Are you scared? Ya... Ok... I'll perform some magic for you... What's that? I'll guess what you're thinking Really? Ok.. Think of a number Subtract that number from itself Add two to it... You're thinking 2! Wow... You haven't yet given me your photo Day after, A foreign guy called Don Bosco is visiting our college And that event will be telecast on TV What am I asking and what're you talking about? Someone has to introduce him onstage Remember when the principal said, He'd do something for me... Are you going to be on TV? Really? You wait, I'll show it to everyone at home... and hype you up to my parents The speech has to be in English I'll write it for you. Prepare well. You have to steal the show tomorrow... Time for class... Lets go. I want that Siti cable fellow here within half an hour Good morning sir. Hi Krishna... You're still here. Go sit down. You said I could speak on stage at the next event I'll introduce the guest sir... Oh... This program is for students scoring above 70% I scored 76% in the second year sir... Oh.. Nice... I'll give you a chance at the next event Sir.. Sir.. Just give me one chance... I will speak well. Look, We were selected out of 40 colleges This program will be on TV The stage needs to look beautiful. First impression is the best impression You know that too... We'll try the next time Come on.. Mr 76% Program's about to start... Hello all... That's the only thing he knows in Telugu Just shut it you idiots... I can speak Telugu Like hell you do! Who'll respect engineers if there's one in every house? Bozo. What the hell am I expecting from you? -Let it go.. -Oh yes.. My promise... Dude... Don't be like this. You know he is an idiot! Weren't you insulted enough already? -He is an idiot... -So? He must be made to feel like one. Two years ago... They were taking photos for the college magazine I went and stood there too... The cameraman pushed me away and picked two other guy and girls. He gave them each a bunch of books and took their pictures. You know why I wasn't in it? Because I'm black. What are you laughing at? Is this a joke to you? This... Exactly this is why... Our lives are this way now... I wanted to speak on stage earlier, I heard something "First impression is the best impression" Dunno which idiot wrote this line... But he needs to be punched in the face. People judging your behavior on first impression, Can still be excused But those judging people by their skin colour, need to be handed a hard beating Because... Engineers are the future! That was a masterstroke! Imagine if instead of this guy we had a Neg- If he was a black guy? There wouldn't be much of a difference Status & money Are these the only things deserving respect? What shitty lives man! "Because, Engineers are the future!" It's not even our fault This was passed down by our ancestors If someone said, that your baby will be born white if you carry it for 18 months... There are mothers willing to wait that long. That's the society we live in. 200 years ago, The British came and conquered us Gifted us the heinous mindset that, "Whites are the rulers" & Everyone else is beneath them... Imagine if the invading foreigners were black people... And he applied the same idea in reverse Would we still fight over the same things? "BECAUSE...!" ENGINEERS ARE THE FUTURE! Wow! Superb! Krishna just rocked it... You're way too excited about this... Of course I am... But then, Wasn't the principal pissed? Pissed? He was furious! That act just highlighted Krishna If the principal punished him for it, He'd have turned into a hero... That's true too... You know how most people are Doesn't matter even if it harms us... We cannot digest someone else taking the limelight That's why He waited for a worthy day.. That's when my Birthday came along Did the computer batch go to their labs? I'm giving a huge birthday surprise to Deepthi Even her husband cannot give something like this... Happy birthday. Thank you -Principal sir... -Principal sir... -Principal sir... Hey. -Sir Principal sir... Call the principal dude... Sorry... No no.. This isn't your fault. Please don't cry... You mustn’t cry on your birthday You.. hero... What should we do? Sir... These two did a huge mistake... -Will you shut it? -No I won't Why should I? That day when I was talking with my girlfriend You humiliated me in front of everyone. These two deserve the exact same punishment. Sir.. He's a child... He did a mistake. Please forgive him Sir... Everyone's a child at home We are the ones who witness their heroism, romance & fights... We know their actual colours... Your son is running a love story here... Sir please don't call this rubbish love Love is a common thing in college If this was actually love, This guy getting that girl Would have made waves in the college Not a single person in the college knows anything about them... You can even call a couple of their friends and ask... No way sir... We know him from the fight that happened, Apart from that, these two are not even friends He's my best friend sir.. I don't even know that girl's name... There is no chance he knows her... Sir don't you see it? These two are doing unwanted activities in the campus That's why they're keeping it a secret... Pretending to be lovers after they got caught Immoral acts sir.... They are always done in secret. What immoral acts are you talking about? Son... Stop it! How dare you hit another student in front of me! Sir... He made a mistake... Please excuse him... No way! I'm going to kick you out of the college... I will see how you will study after this... Hey... Stop it! I don't want to ever see your face again. Bloody childish nonsense... Let's go. -Brother.... -Let's go Get out! Out! -If you marry someone like him, -Your children will be born black too... -Why didn't you think about that when you married your husband? -I sent you to your brother's for your studies, -But you've gotten completely out of hand... -I came here for your birthday... -And this is what I find out... -I wonder what goes on here normally... -Thank god, your father doesn't know about this... -Who the hell called you here? Did I? -Don't throw my reputation out the door, Come inside -No! Why don't you go and stop them. -If it's so embarrassing, maybe I should leave you people now... Is this the rubbish you've been teaching her everyday? I'm watching... I'm observing everything... If you marry him, we'll all hang and die... You want to die for me... He wants to die for me... Your threat reeks of pride & prestige... His words are filled with love. Which is greater? Pride or love? Tell me... Which is greater? Pride or Love? Go inside the house now! I will not! You! Pack her bags. Where to? Vijayawada Preparation holidays... -I don't want to see your face in this college again! Poor thing How will she live alone? So far away... No problem I have some important things to take care of here... Let her stay there until then What are you planning? I'm going to find a handsome husband for my sister. She will give birth to a daughter I will marry her to my son I couldn't have it... At least my next generation should be born beautiful That is my only responsibility... What is the point of making all these plans...? Everything is destined at birth. You know what I was up to the year you were born? I was studying 7th... So god had no clue what destiny to write for me until then? Never allow your destiny to be written by someone else... Mr Ramesh... I was just waiting for your call... Did you arrange the liquor and special biryani? Ready sir... That guy is sitting alone outside his house and drinking... Oh no... He mustn't drink alone like that... Bring him too... Sir...? What did you think preparation holidays were for? This is what it is... You just bring him soon... Girl... That's enough of that... Go get my white shirt... Why do want to wear a white shirt with all that henna on the hair? Important jobs need to have a proper dress code... Weird... This is Aakashavani... Ramaraju is going to serve hot special Biryani... "Sir, why are you hitting me like this?" "What is my crime?" "I don't understand what's going on..." Don't insult me by asking these routine questions... I didn't plan to run away or elope with Deepthi... I was going to study well, get a job, And then come ask you for her hand Oh you want to study is it...? You want to marry my sister? Is it? Ramesh... Then start studying afresh from the beginning again... Sir sir sir... My education... Please don't sir... Please sir... Sir sir sir... please sir... Don't ruin my life sir... Sir please stop it sir... Let it burn properly... Sir... Please sir... You were saying something earlier... Repeat it for me Why do you hate me so much? Why indeed...? Try to become white without the help of this powder... Then I'll happily give my sister to you... This coming from you is unfair sir... Oh is it...? Before I took birth, If god gave an option to be Black or white... I'd choose white. But he didn't let me choose. But I have the chance to select my Brother-in-law So why would I choose a worthless mongrel like you..? Ok leave it. Can you at least, afford to buy minimum luxuries for my sister's child? I will... Colour might be important for love or marriage... But colour is not important for sustaining a family I'm tired of hearing the same dialogue every time... -Sir.. -yes sir... Bring that Biryani we prepared Feed him and send him away... Us cops are very kind-hearted... We always feed you after a beating I haven't mixed anything in it... Eat up... Mr Ramesh... Is it dry yet? It'll take some more time... So we do have some time to waste... Since you're eating anyway Let me tell you a nice story I wanted to feed you tasty Biryani We found a juicy goat... It was this big We turned it over and started cutting it's throat That's when it started to cry... I'm sensitive by nature... I went in close to it and said, Oh your poor goat, and asked what it's last wish was... To which it tearfully replied... "I'm not a goat sir..." "I'm a calf" And said, "My name is Lakshmi..." Hey... You're done for the day Get lost Go! Hey! I read in a newspaper yesterday Eating human flesh is supposed to activate supernatural powers... If I hear you talk about Love, Marriage or any other nonsense like that... Take a guess whose meat you'll be eating next time... Come dear... Sit down Have some coffee Congratulations We found a groom from America. Six figure salary, Your life is set now I called his dad for lunch today He asked for some betel leaves after eating You know I'm a nice guy... So I also offered your hand in marriage Sir, she is quite tall. How tall is the groom? Height? Mr Ramesh, What was that Salman Khan song we were watching? "Oh Oh Jaane jaana..." Correct sir. He looks exactly like that Huge chiseled arms Super sir Big chiseled biceps, dimple on the chin when he smiles, Wavy hair, And being able to bend and touch ones toes These are the things we think are beautiful Stop doing that and maybe our lives will improve. Marriages are not sustained by biceps and skin tones You need a heart. Mr Ramesh, We broke someone's hand. What's his name? Abhi... Abhiram sir... He was telling the same rubbish... Heart is greater, Love is greater... Nonsense... But he was right sir... Mr Pawan I'm going to ask you a question Think hard before you answer Someone you deeply loved is dead. You're crying next to their body. Suddenly a Tiger enters, What will you do? I'll run away sir... Now tell me... Which is greater? Love or Fear. Fear sir Tell me... Which is greater? Love or Fear. Someone asked for betel leaves and gave them a surprise gift Won't you give me something for my birthday? Tell me what you want... Hall ticket. I want to write my exams Deepthi Indukuri, Computer science. Jaya-He Jaya-he Jaya-he Why aren't you worried about a cigarette sir? People are on the terrace... Smoking. You know how harmful they are to humans Only Krishna above can know. Let's go in the evening. We will catch someone soon.... Please give me my Hall ticket sir... I need to use the washroom. Hello sir... Hello.. Hello... Hello What's your friend up to nowadays? He took a severe beating, He's just resting for a bit Why do I feel that you're hiding something? Then come see my Fa- Look at my face. Do you really think I can do that? Sir you know me... I'm a nice guy Did my brother do this? I'm so sorry... All this is happening because of me... Forget about all that... I've made all the arrangements We are going to fool your brother and run away... But the police...? Seniors to Juniors, Lecturers to workers, The entire college is supporting us... What do you mean? Don't they all hate you? Can you trust them? Deepu... People everywhere are scared of all kinds of snakes Even that snake is worshipped on day every year, The festival of 'Nagula Chavithi' Today is that day for us... What is the process to join the department? Balu... Sir... Sometimes when you're angry on someone, And you can't take it out on them... We break things or walls within our reach From now, you're my wall... If anything goes wrong... I'm not your wall sir... I am Jamba Jamba? What's that? Jambavan from Ramayana sir... I gave my word to my Hanuman. If ever you're in any trouble The entire Monkey army shall stand behind you, and beat the sticks out of anyone... Monkey Army? What's that? Just one more hour from now, I need not be formal with you anymore... Silence There will be time for whistles later... What do you think of students? An ID card, a pen in the pocket, a notebook in hand, Shirt, Pant, Socks, shoes this isn't what a student is about. Every student has a heart. That heart wants someone That heart can only marry the one it wants... You cannot simply force it to do as you wish... You can clap now! We're in 1999 now Even in this day and age, You're in a position to obsess about colour & caste... Our Superstar's son recently entered movies, Cute guy, looks like an apple Mahesh Babu... You think you're as fair as Mahesh Babu? There really isn't much of a difference between us. You're a 3.5 I'm a 3.75 I'm at 4 If colour really is that big a deal for you... First take a look at yourself in the mirror... If you still haven't figured it out, Go look at your wedding photos But I'm not going to come down to your level. Sir, What I'm saying is, We come into this world already loved, We seek out another love once we grow up... If we ever have to choose between the two, What we choose determines our future... Your sister chose me... So to prove that her selection is absolutely right, I'm taking her away Nope... We are eloping. Monkey Army Take guard! Super sister! What happened after that? What do you think? Now I'm happily married... Also FYI, I'm 4 months pregnant. Winning brings us happiness! Losing gives us experience. When someone loses, they are in a position to see How close they came to success. If only they'd tried harder... And then there are those... whose tears have dried up... I do not wish that you come to that... Let's go... I understand the meaning of life now Now watch me... Watch how I win for her... Happy journey For now & ever! -Thank you... -All the best then... Take care of her... Bye... -Bye... -Bye Lets go... Wasn't that the climax scene of 'Nuvvu Nenu'? I dunno... Don't think it released in US... Even so... Some story you made up, I badly wanted to believe that was true. Look, what they need right now, isn't financial or family support, They need moral support That's why I did that... Everybody coming together in the end and helping one guy succeed only happens in stories... If there was a chance of it happening, Kannayya would have won that day That's why... I've been re-writing his story with happy endings these 6 years.... I told them one of those today... Well, it was a good story... The actual truth is unbearable... Please don't cry... I feel like crying too... Sit down... How did this happen? Talk about Love, Marriage and all that crap again, Think about whose meat you might get to eat next time... I don't care that you burned my certificates... I'm ready to hard manual labor to take care of your sister... Lift him up! Forget about Al that... How have you been? They hid me away in Vijayawada My brother's friend is a scoundrel He touched me whenever he wanted... One day while I was sleeping, He tried to kiss me while I was sleeping When I told my mom about this, She thought it was a ploy to come back home. She asked me not to lie about such things... She said my brother would kill me if he found out... I'm sorry... Why? I wanted to study Get a job and build a life with you.. He snatched my education from me I could have relied on myself and found my legs somehow He broke my leg too... He even snatched away my dear Lakshmi... Every time I tried to fight back, Situations have been beating me down harder... I don't think I can fight anymore We have so many friends, No one came forward to help? I asked them. They said, if I loved someone in my range, I wouldn't have to face all this... They advised me to forget you... People love the moon all year round. But it is hated on Vinayaka Chavithi That's what my life has become Nothing is more horrible being unable to do even simple daily tasks.... Just one more year later, I was going to take care of my dad like a king. But now he has to help me up to the toilet, A grown adult son, Should be the crown on his father's head Not a burden to him. I want to kill myself at this point What shall we do now? We come into this world already loved, We seek out another love once we grow up... If we ever have to choose between the two, That choice determines our future... If colour really is that big a deal for you... First take a look at yourself in the mirror... If you still don't get it, Go look at your wedding photos To prove that my selection is absolutely right, I'm running away. Sorry... I'm eloping. No... She's a kid... I'll talk to her. We're about to die in 5 minutes Only criminals about to be hanged and us know this feeling What's your last wish? I want to smoke It'll ruin your health If you remember, we drank poison 5 minutes ago. What's your last wish? Last wish... I saw this in a few movies, Just when the hero or heroine is about to die, They put their head on the other's lap and have a sudden revelation. Something completely new... Ok, let me go first. Come on... No... You first. I'm smoking. Ok. Just because it's your last wish Something new... Do you know how I saw you for the first time? How? You were dancing I saw you dressed as the goddess. Love at first sight... Normally, when there's love at first sight, I starts off as attraction or lust We desire that beauty... That slowly turns into love... But the first thing I felt when I saw you, Was devotion. The purest relation in the world, is devotion We might scold our friends or even our parents some time... But you cannot bring yourself to scold god. Devotion has no negatives Just Love, Trust, and fear. Love towards you, Trusting that you will be mine, Fear of losing you. All three things began at the same time for me. With that belief, I thought I can win you over. But.... We're in the year 1999, Even today, beauty is measured in terms of colour. Status is measured in caste. If my daughter is born with my colour Let her be of my caste, When she grows to be as old as me now, I mean in 2020. She should be loved for who she is... But not for her beauty. You know I hate sympathy... But now, Everybody is showering me with sympathy That day in the bus stop, I shouldn't have used the word 'Handicapped'... Tell me the truth, You too loved me out of sympathy didn't you? You're done? Can I talk now? Why didn't you ever tell me about this love at first sight? Do you know when I fell for you? Just like how you saw me... I saw you just the same way Even today, that's how I look at you! Why do you think it's sympathy? I like your smile... I like the way you talk... I like your voice, You're a handsome guy man... When there's so much about you to love, Why would I have sympathy? Come on answer me... Kannayya... Kannayya... Get up... Kannayya... Kannayya get up It was never sympathy, Hear just this one thing please, Kannayya... Get up Kannayya... I'm feeling Dizzy... Get up please... Please get up... Please Kannayya Sir... Please don't I really don't know where he is. I told you already, You're my wall. Bloody rascal! Give me the keys. I know what to do with you Deepu! Deepu! Deepu! Ramesh! Kittu get up man! You know, I'm scared of dead bodies... Kittu please! Everyone has 4 friends in life, I have only you Balu... Uncle, it's time. We need to cremate him while it is still light... Its just the two of us... How do we take him there? You M*********** I can't imagine the pain you felt. I worked for the railways before Kittu was born... I worked as a train engine driver... On that job, every other day, People committed suicide by jumping in front of the train... I used to blare the horn! I used to beg them not to do this... They would still get crushed underneath, There are about 1500 people in a Train normally, But I was the only one who knew there was a dead body beneath us... I used to weep, all alone, in the engine room. Poor souls... That's why... I left that job after kittu was born Death is unstoppable. This is a fact. Everybody dies... However, Kittu unfortunately, went a little early... That's all... Do you have at least one photo of him? I don't have even one. I don't my dear... We lost them all in a fire accident Kittu jumped in and saved his mother's photo along with his certificates He seems to have misplaced the certificates too... Please uncle... Just one.. I don't have any my dear... That's the truth I will go now... You must have a garlanded photo to remember him by... I'll return it back in the morning, please... I'll just go get it... I'll bring it back right away... What happened to Balu? He was driven mad that same day... He's in an institution... -Come. Come here... -Hey Wow! So this is Jaya Krishna... Finally! Nice to meet you bro... Dark & handsome like Lord Krishna He was good looking. He was.. wasn't he..? He died because he didn't get the support he needed... But he is now an inspiration to a couple of lovers... He doesn't have a single photo in his own home... But he has a beautiful painting of him in America. Wow... Jaya Krishna... I'm so jealous of you man... I love you too... You didn't have a photo How did you finish it finally? His eyes are exactly like his mother's... All said and done, The painting is amazing. This is not a painting. This is Jaya Krishna's Colour Photo.
