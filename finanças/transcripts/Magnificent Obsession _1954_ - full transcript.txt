[engine roaring] Bob! Bob, take it easy! Easy? Where does that get you? - On dry land, I hope. -[laughing] He's doing 150 or better. He's comin' in, believe it or not. Help Miss Daniels off. - I'm making another run. - Bob, it's not safe out there. - That's why you're just going to watch. - It's startin' to kick up out there, Mr. Merrick. You keep this engine tuned. That's all I want from you. [engine revs] What's the matter with him? Hasn't he got any brains? He doesn't have to. He's got four million bucks. He must be doin' better than 180 now. -[screaming] - I knew that would happen! -150 miles an hour! - Miss Daniels, phone Emergency right away! - Yes! - Come on, Joe. Hurry up! [oxygen hissing] [mechanic] He's startin' to breathe, Bill. I'll switch over to inhalator. - That was a close one. - Bob Merrick just lives right. [siren wailing] - Is that the ambulance? - Yeah. Well, there's nothin' more we can do here now. All right, everybody. There's nothin' to see. You can take off now. [man on radio] 181. Come in, 181. 181, come in. Go ahead. Return the resuscitator to Dr. Phillipe's home as soon as possible. Emergency! 181. Understood. Emergency. They want the resuscitator right away, Bill. - All right. - Completing assignment now. Victim being picked up by Brightwood Hospital ambulance. - Return the resuscitator - - Yes, yes. I know. Returning the resuscitator to Dr. Phillips. [starter cranking] [engine starts] - Did they say why they wanted it? - Nope. Just to rush it back to Dr. Phillipe's house. Hurry. Dr. Phillips - an accident. We got it back as fast as we could. What's the trouble, Miss Ashford? - Take it inside for Dr. Phillips, Bill. - All right, Miss Ashford. - Did you see Mrs. Phillipe's car anywhere? - No, we didn't, Miss Ashford. Oh. Oh, I hope they get back in time. 181 reporting. We're at Dr. Phillipe's house. Do you suppose it'll be too chilly to eat out on the terrace? We could fix the tables with hurricane lamps. Oh, Helen, you're putting on an awful lot of swank for practically no reason. [chuckling] You bought out half the town. Well, isn't a wedding anniversary enough reason to have a party? - You wait till you get married. - Oh, but a six-months anniversary. Well, I've never been married six months before, and I want to tell the world that I love it. Well, don't you think you ought to have given Dad some hint what he was in for? [laughs] I should say not. Why, he had nine different reasons at the hospital why he couldn't come home for dinner. Wayne Phillips can invent an emergency operation at the drop of a hat if he knows he's gonna be the guest of honor at a dinner party. -[chuckling] - Now what's the matter? Oh, I was just thinking of the toast I'd give you two. "To Wayne Phillips, a great surgeon, a fine man, and my wonderful father. And to you, love and affection to my mother." "Mother"? Oh, Joyce, you wouldn't. Well, you are my mother. You married my father. You're certainly the only mother I've ever known, and I'm all in favor of the whole arrangement. I sure feel sorry for them. Oh, Joyce. It's so pleasant. We can have dinner outside without any trouble at all. [Miss Ashford] Helen. Why, Nancy. What are you doing over here? - Oh, Helen. Helen. - What's the matter? - It's Wayne. - What? He's had an accident. Dr. Dodge is with him. - Well, where is he? - Here. Oh, Helen. Helen. Wayne had an attack, and - - No. - Dad! [Joyce, crying] Oh, no, Those poor girls. He was such a wonderful man. He did so much for people. Why, Dr. Dodge? Why? How many times I've been asked that question. I've never learned the answer. Nancy, if you'd go in with her. [sobbing] Joyce, I know there's nothing I can say. What happened, Derwin? Nancy and I had come over from the hospital to go sailing with him this afternoon. He must have had the occlusion just a few minutes before we got here. We saw him down at the pier, all slumped over. - The resuscitator didn't help at all? - No. It wasn't here. - It wasn't here? - No. But Dad's kept the resuscitator here for years because he had a coronary. You knew that. Why, in heaven's name - Where was it? Bob Merrick had capsized his boat at the other end of the lake. The police came over for it just before this - Bob Merrick. Oh, you don't know him. I do. He's a stupid, spoiled darn fool. And now to think Bob Merrick's alive because of Dad's resuscitator... and Dad isn't. I could kill him! [sobbing] Helen. Helen. I loved him so much, Derwin, with all my heart... and we only had these few short months together. Frankly, I haven't any idea how you're supposed to do it. Just take the barge out there and get her up. Don't bother me with excuses. Get it done. What about Campbell? When does he get in from Detroit? I don't want anybody else touching those engines. Fly him up here and don't argue with me. If I may be allowed to take your temperature, Mr. Merrick? Nonsense. I'm not even lukewarm. All right. That's better. And have Jerry call me as soon as he hears about the insurance. Yeah. Am I getting out of here today? Mr. Merrick, the very instant you're able to leave Brightwood safely, we shall be most happy to sign your discharge. -[radio: big band, jazz] - But first - This is absolutely ridiculous. I'm perfectly healthy. A small respiratory infection, a slight concussion, but certainly no subdural clot. A subdural clot, Doctor, is a hematoma anywhere in the cranial cavity. Thank you. I merely wondered where you acquired that piece of information. Let me have a line. I was in med school when my father died. - I haven't wasted all my time, you know. - Why'd you quit? - Just too rough for a Merrick? - I'll tell you why. My father died at 42 - Hello, Val? Who? No. And suddenly it seemed a very sensible idea to enjoy life while I could. - Let me have another line. - And my, how you've succeeded. - Hello, Val? -[radio clicks off] How've you been, baby? Don't go in there, Nancy. You even have to make a formal request to take his temperature. When I think Dr. Phillips died so that he could live. Yes. What a complete waste. Have you talked to Helen today? No, not since yesterday. She's coming over this morning to start going through the doctor's things. Mmm. You can count on it, baby. It's a date. Good-bye. [big band] Would you do me a great big favor and get Dr. Phillips down here to look at me so I can get out? Here. Look, I haven't got a temperature. It's absolutely immaterial to me, Mr. Merrick, but I'm going to take your temperature one way or another. - A human being. - Under the tongue, please. - Where have you been all week? -[clicks off] What kind of an establishment is this, will you tell me? I've been here five days, and everybody treats me like a leper. - No visitors. - That seemed advisable. My own doctor doesn't even come up. No. When Dr. Allward talked to Dr. Dodge, he agreed that the case didn't warrant his coming up. - He's very busy in New York. - Then why don't I get Wayne Phillips? It's his hospital, isn't it? And it's obvious I'll get the biggest bill. Don't look shocked. I'm used to it. I wasn't shocked, Mr. Merrick. - I was only thinking. - You were thinking what? I was thinking, when your father left you the Merrick Motor Company and all those millions, what a pity he couldn't also bequeath you a little common courtesy. I don't know where you got those pajamas or where you keep getting these cigarettes, but your pharyngitis is bad enough without them. In words in one syllable, Mr. Merrick, you talk too much. Well, now that we have that settled, how about getting Doc Phillips down here to give me my separation papers? Well, the reason the staff may have seemed so distant, Mr. Merrick, is that Dr. Phillips died a few days ago. It was rather sudden, and he was quite admired by all of us. All you had to do was tell me. It hasn't been easy to talk about. When will I get out of here? I have too many things to do that can't wait. I can't say. Perhaps in a few days. [door opens, closes] You wanna bet? Brightwood Hospital. He's busy. Will you wait? - Miss Phillips, all these came this morning. - Oh, thanks. -[switchboard buzzes] - Brightwood Hospital. - Mrs. Phillips in? - Yes, she is. They're still coming. Amazing, isn't it? Oh, I'm sorry. -[door closes] -[mouths words] Yes, thank you. All right. We'll see you. Good-bye. That was Torn. He's in the village and coming over. He seemed a little more urgent than he had to be. I suspect that lawyer of mine just wanted to spend the afternoon with you. “Dottore Vittorio Laradetti. Rome.“ I had no idea there were so many people who respected Dad so much and who felt so much in his debt - from all over the country. From all over the world. Oh, listen to this, Joyce. "Dear Mrs. Dr. Phillips, You don't know me, but I owe everything in the world to Dr. Phillips." -[knocking] - Yes, come in. I'm sorry to bother you, Helen, but there's another lady here to see you. A Mrs. Eden. I tried to tell her, but she says she has to talk to you. - Want me to talk to her? - No. Have her come in, Nancy. - Mrs. Eden. - Thank you. - Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Eden. - How do you do, my dear? - How do you do, Mrs. Eden? Won't you sit down? - Thank you. We're going to have to be very firm about visitors, for her sake. Oh, yes, I know. Yesterday afternoon, there were six or eight. This morning, it's beginning again. Apparently, Dad had helped them meet some crisis. - Money? - No, not always. Sometimes just advice. But, you know, Nancy, when you try to pin them down as to how they became indebted to Dad, they stammer and dodge as though they belonged with him to some secret society. Strange. Dr. Phillips insisted that it be kept secret, but now that he's dead, I-l suppose I can talk about it, don't you? Certainly. It came to $4,000 altogether, and I want to pay you back. Why didn't you return it to Dr. Phillips? Why do you come now? Oh, my dear, I tried so many times, but he wouldn't take it. He'd become very excited and he'd say, "You haven't told anyone about this?" And I'd say, "Of course not. You told us not to." And then he'd say, "That's right, Mrs. Eden. Any help I give you is just between us." And he wouldn't let you repay it? He said he couldn't take it back because he'd - he'd already used it all up. And then he'd say to invest it. "Invest in what?" I'd say. And - and he'd say, "Any poor devil." Wasn't that strange? Mrs. Eden, what did he mean when he said "used it all up"? I've tried to think so many times. Don't you know, Mrs. Phillips? No. It's very odd. In four letters this week, there's exactly the same expression. But it is a debt, and I want to take care of it. Well, you don't owe me anything, Mrs. Eden. If - If Dr. Phillips couldn't accept this, then neither can I. Well, if that's what you want, Mrs. Phillips, but- You keep it and use it... for any poor devil. All right. He was a very remarkable man, wasn't he? Yes, he was. Perhaps more remarkable than any of us knew. [vehicle approaching] Hello, darling. How are you? All right. Much better now that you're here. - How's Helen feeling? - Oh, you know. - Oh, golly, Tom. I've missed you. - I've missed you too. Good-bye. Hello, Torn. Thank you for coming all this way. Helen, I wish I'd have been able to come up Sunday, but I've been swamped. I wanted to talk to both of you about the, uh, estate. The estate? Why, I hadn't even thought of it. Neither had I. I guess I should've been a better attorney. I've made a complete survey of Wayne's finances. And I, uh - Helen, I have to tell you. I don't know if you two will have any money to speak of at all. [Joyce] Not even insurance? Wayne had a hundred-thousand-dollar policy, but he'd borrowed the maximum on it. The rest might pay the taxes and his debts. But what happened, Torn? Some of Dad's fees were fabulous. The Tallyrand operation the papers were full of. When Wayne removed the neoplasm from the Tallyrand boy, he received, uh , $25,000 for it. This was all withdrawn within seven weeks, in four checks all made out to "cash." Why, the account's full of cash withdrawals. Where'd all this money go, Helen? Wayne didn't discuss money with me. I really wouldn't know. Well, that leaves you and Joyce with the house and very little else. And the hospital is liable to be in very rocky shape too. Can't something be worked out, Torn? I wanted to go over all the records here and find out what other assets he might have - those you'll let me collect for you, that is. And after that, well, we'll see where you stand exactly. Well, thank you very much for all your trouble. And you do as you feel best. - Will you excuse me? - Certainly. I have to go to the house. The gardener's a little confused about what bulbs to lift this fall. I promised I'd do it. It can't wait any longer. I'll see you both at the house. [door opens] - Can I help? - I suspect you could help... tremendously. Are you all right? Adequate as can be. - Going to the village? - Yes. Can I give you a lift? - You certainly can. - All right. I'll make it. I'll make it. - What seems to be the trouble? - Oh, it's a long story. You wouldn't be interested. - You, uh, live around here? - Yes. I should've collapsed on one of these roads long ago. - I meant it in the very nicest way. - I'm sure you did. You don't sound like it. Well, I'm sorry, but I have a lot of things on my mind. That's all right. So do I. Can't we talk about it better after I take you to lunch? I think not. [chuckles] Well, uh, before you decide I'm just a character who stumbled out of the woods, Miss P. - Monogram on your purse. 20/20. Always keep 'em open. My name is Phillips. Mrs. Wayne Phillips. Oh. I'm sorry, Mrs. Phillips. You know, I just heard about your husband. I'm really sorry. He must've been a really great person. It's a rough way to go. Well, maybe they'll get another resuscitator up here now. Resuscitator? Did they try to use one on him? We would've had his at the house, but there'd been an accident across the lake, and the police took it there. You mean... the accident Bob Merrick had? Yes. Bob Merrick. So... Bob Merrick is alive... and only because your husband - [sighs] Let me out up here, will you? - Thanks. - Are you sure you're all right? He can't have just disappeared. Miss O'Malley, flash Dr. Dodge. All right. Thanks. There's work to do. Have Dr. Dodge report to the front desk immediately. -[switchboard buzzes] - Brightwood Hospital. - Helen, what's the matter? - I just gave a man a ride on the lake road. He's in shock or exhausted. He's out in the car. Frank, get a stretcher. It's Bob Merrick. Who? Come on. I want you to rest a little while, Helen. It's - Oh, it just came before I was ready for it. I know, darling. - I'm all right, Nancy. - Well, don't talk about it. Come in and lie down a little while. I don't know, Nancy. Maybe it's just as well. I'll never have to see him again. -[phone board buzzing] - Brightwood Hospital. Mrs. Phillips? I'm sorry. I can't ring her. - Yes, Mr. Merrick? - My bill ready? Yes, sir. Mrs. Phillips is in Dr. Phillipe's office, and she's asked me to hold her calls. Thank you. I will give Mrs. Phillips your message. -[phone board buzzes] - Brightwood Hospital. Your bill, Mr. Merrick. -[buzzing] - Brightwood Hospital. I will ring. -[buzzing] - Brightwood Hospital. I'll flash Dr. Staley. You've answered so many questions that have been puzzling me, Mr. Randolph. Several people in the last few days have mentioned Wayne's way of life. And when they talk about "using it all up," I - I had no idea what they meant. I'm so happy that you could tell me. You don't talk much about this belief. When someone's ready for it, they accept it. Perhaps Wayne felt that you weren't quite ready, or, Mrs. Phillips, that you were pretty perfect without it. [chuckles] Well, I must be going. Wayne mentioned so many times how anxious he was for me to meet you. I'm so sorry it had to be under these circumstances. I flew up from Mexico as soon as I heard. I thought possibly I might be able to - Make it a little easier for me? Well, you have. Thank you. - We'll be seeing you very soon, I hope. - You certainly will. - I'll be back in my studio now. -[knocking] Mrs. Phillips, I want to talk to you. - I'm very busy. - Oh, I was just leaving. - Good-bye. - Good-bye, and thank you. Mr. Merrick, I don't think you and I have anything to talk about. - I know the way you feel about me. - Please leave me alone. I know your husband was an eminent surgeon, and everybody is saying that a character like Merrick is still around while your husband is - Here. And what is that supposed to do? Supposed to do? Most people would be very glad to get it. Will paying all of those thousands help you forget it happened? It's all very simple to you, isn't it? A check can take care of anything anytime. Most people would be very happy to receive $25,000. Was it my fault? I didn't ask you for your resuscitator, you know. Smash up somebody's car when you're drunk and write out a check. Get in a mess with a showgirl and write out a check. And when a man dies, write out a check to his widow. - Account paid in full. - Listen, Mrs. Phillips. Leave me alone! [door opens, closes] When you go to Mexico City, you must hear Rosario. His voice is just divine. It does things for me. Good for you, but he doesn't sound like my type. This roadster - uh, pardon me - is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. The guy that owned it must have spent a fortune on it. - Good for him. - It's got all kinds of gadgets. It's got, uh, red spoke wheels. [woman] It's really a very fine show. I liked it. - Hey, what did they do to you in that joint? - Hmm? I know your big trouble, honey. You need Val to take care of you. The principal difficulty seems to be that the anesthetics you get in these bars are never as effective as the customer hopes. What, honey? Good night, baby. Paughs] - How about a drink, Val? - No, thank you. - Don't you want to take me home? - That's an interesting idea. I'll call you. So long and farewell. [tires squealing] [knocking] [knocking continues] [Merrick, chuckling] Good ol' Paul Revere. - Oh. - Yes? [slurred voice] I'm sorry to bother you this time of night. I just clobbered my car in the ditch. Look. That's all right. Come in. Thank you for your hospitality. It's a nice place you have here. Very nice place indeed. - You all right? - Me? Of course. It takes more than prangin' up a car to incapacitate ol' Bob Merrick, pride of the Merrick clan. - You're Bob Merrick, huh? - Who are you? - Edward Randolph. - How do you - Who? It's all right. I live here. Edward, may I please bother you for a telephone, please? - Why, of course. - Wait a minute. Gotta call somebody and tell 'em to come over here and pick me up. Must be sure and tell 'em to wear their safety belts. - Right back here. - Where? - Right back here. - Oh. [chuckles] Go slow. Hello? Hello there. Ed, did you do these pictures? - Yes. - Nice. Of course, as far as I'm concerned, "art" is just a guy's name. Williams. - Uh, don't you think you'd better dial? - Shh. Williams. This is Robert Merrick, Esquire. I had a little insignificant trouble with my car. Would you please come over and pick me up, please? Williams. Don't snore, old man. Wake up. Hardest thing these days - getting good help. Very nice job. Where have we met? Don't tell me. Don't tell me. I met you - Is that - It's a portrait I did of Wayne Phillips. [whispers] Phillips. Phillips. He's the man who's haunting me. You know what? I almost drowned, but a good old resuscitator saved me. Whose is it? Dr. Phillipe's. Then they shoot me to a hospital and make old Merrick good for another 20,000 miles. Whose hospital? Dr. Phillipe's. Then I meet her. A girl - A girl who is a very beautiful girl. Whose wife is she? One guess, pal. - Now, look here, Merrick. - Pardon me. Tell me where we've met. In the hospital, in Dr. Phillipe's office. Dr. Phillips. You see? He is haunting me. Oh, it's all right. Don't bother with - [murmurs] Oh. [groans] - I'm glad you made it. - Oh, I'm not sure I have. Try this anyway- [Grumbles] Do you mind telling me what happened? Oh, I wrecked the car... in a ditch. Yeah. The right-front wheel. I already called your house and asked someone to come over. - I hope you don't mind. - Not at all. - Think a shower would help? - I certainly do. Make it a cold one. Up those stairs and to the right. Thanks a lot. [groans] I hope I wasn't too much trouble last night. When I pass out, I usually like to be in my own bed. No trouble. Now I know where I saw you - with Helen Phillips. That's right, Merrick. Will you take these? - Yes. - Thank you. Have you known her long? No. But Wayne Phillips was the best friend I had. Coffee's ready. Yes. The portrait you did of him - It's really good. You're quite a painter. Well, maybe I am now. If so, I have Phillips to thank. He's the one who unlocked everything. - Phillips did? - Yes. I met him some years ago when I was still trying to find my way in painting, getting nowhere. I spent my life making fairly adequate copies of the masters. I always wanted to create like they did, but I just never could, until Phillips showed me how to get what I wanted. Well, how did he do that? How could a surgeon help? Well, he taught me - He showed me how to establish contact with the source of infinite power. Well, that sounds fine. What does it mean? [chuckles] Well, let me put it this way. This lamp isn't working now. It's cold and it's dark. All the parts are there. - It's a perfect light, but - - It's just not turned on. Right. But if I turn the switch and establish contact, the bulb will draw power from the powerhouse down at the dam, and it'll do what it was meant to do, which is to make light. All right. So you're saying that people have, well, a sort of powerhouse too. Right. And when you establish contact with that, you can do what you're meant to do. - You can fulfill your destiny. - I can turn on a light. I don't think that's your destiny. - Do you? - No, I guess not. But assuming there is a - well, a power of some kind, or whatever you want to call it, how do you establish contact with it? It's very simple. Just be of real service to people. Find people who need help and help them. But always in secret. Never let it be known. Never ask to be repaid. But if you're of service to people, why does it have to be kept secret? Well, that's probably the most important part of this belief. Let's go back to the powerhouse. If the wires in the dynamo are not protected by insulation, the power will be dissipated. Same thing goes for us. Most personalities are just grounded. - That's all that ails them. - I see. You mean keeping these good deeds secret is like insulating the power of your personality. Yeah, that's near enough. Well, if it works, fine. Obviously, it helped you. Isn't there anything in the world that you need that you haven't been able to get in the ordinary way? Not a thing. Except... I'd like to square myself with Helen Phillips. Oh? But if I just help out some poor joker, why does it follow that she's gonna listen to me? I think you might be surprised at what follows after trying this way of life. Well, if it's as simple as all that, why, I'll certainly give it a chance. Now, wait, Merrick. Don't try to use this unless you're ready for it. You can't just try this out for a week like a new car, you know. And if you think you can feather your own nest with it, just forget it. Besides, this is dangerous stuff. One of the first men who used it went to the cross at the age of 33. [knocking] Excuse me. - Oh, won't you come in, please? - I beg your pardon. - I understand that Mr. Merrick is here. - I'm here, Williams. - Oh, good morning, Mr. Merrick. - Morning. Well, good-bye. Thanks for everything. You take pretty good care of a drunk and his hangover. Well, I ought to know how by this time. I've been there myself. [both chuckling] [tires screech] [parking brake sets] Mr. Merrick. Is it good to see you around again. Hello, Dan. No. Mark it down another look you owe me. How's the family? Oh, not so hot. We lost the baby, you know. - Oh? - The missus is still in the hospital. - Those bills are pretty rough. - I'm sorry to hear it, Dan. - Say, Dan. - Yes, Mr. Merrick? How much do you need altogether, for all the expenses? Oh, about $300 would do it. - Oh, now look, Mr. Merrick - - It's yours. - Thanks a million. - On two conditions. - Anything. - Don't tell anybody about this. - Why? What do you mean? I've got to tell my wife. - No, not even your wife. And never try to pay it back. I don't want it. - Anything you say. - Good. But this is sure a funny way to help a guy out, isn't it, Mr. Merrick? I think you're absolutely right. - I don't believe it. - Your order, Mr. Merrick? It does work. Thank you, Phyllis. Joyce and I will see you again very soon. - We're not going to hibernate. - I'm glad of that. - Good-bye. - Bye-bye. Mrs. Phillips. This is more than just a coincidence. - I've got to talk to you. - Well, I'm sorry, but I was just leaving. Well, you have two minutes, haven't you? Perhaps I wasn't as diplomatic as I could have been, but believe me, I did mean well, really. Well, we've all been under quite a strain. I'm sorry if I said anything I shouldn't have. You know, what I can't understand is how we've avoided knowing each other before this. Well, it wasn't intentional, I assure you. I think we ought to do all we can to correct that mistake, don't you? Of course. I'm very late. Mrs. Phillips. We haven't decided where we're gonna have dinner tonight. I have a previous engagement. Excuse me. Please don't go. I'd like to ask you about this theory of Dr. Phillipe's that Edward Randolph was telling me about. Why would he talk to you about it? Well, I guess he believes in it. I guess I'm starting to believe in it, too, after meeting you here. - What has meeting me got to do with it? - Well, I - I just did something. I'm gonna go find somebody that needs a couple of thousand bucks, and my worries will be over. I think you've twisted my husband's beliefs into something very cheap. Taxi? Wait a minute. - Fifteen Lake Drive, please. - Mrs. Phillips. - I wouldn't offend you for the world. - Just drive on. - Wait here. Mrs. Phillips - - Please don't start a scene. I'm only trying to tell you that - -[Merrick] Look out! -[horn honks] -[phone board buzzes] - Brightwood Hospital. The line is busy. Will you hold? - I'll try to locate him for you. -[buzzing] Brightwood Hospital. I'll take a message. I can connect you now. -[buzzing] - Brightwood Hospital. - Is there any chance at all? - No. How about the X-ray findings? They leave no hope. She's lucky to be alive. Will you tell them, Nancy? - All right. - Thank you. Miss Ashford. How is she? Joyce. She's going to live. And she'll be all right in time? Not completely. There's an inoperable lesion. - What is it? - Where? Well, her eyes. Tell me, Nancy. Let me have it straight. - She'll be blind. - Blind. It can't be. Oh, no. [sobbing] Miss Ashford. Could I see her? - Haven't you done enough? - Joyce, don't. It's the truth, isn't it? Why shouldn't I say it? She'll never see again, thanks to you. Write a check for that, Mr. Merrick. [Joyce sobbing] No, Nancy. No. Darling, don't you think if you just talked to him once? What good would it do? What could he possibly say? And what difference would it make now? I don't blame him for anything, Nancy. It's just that I feel it's better if I don't see him at all. Well, I'll send him away. I'm sorry, Mr. Merrick. She won't see you. [door opens] [door closes] - Nancy? - Yes, darling? I know I'm right. He'll finally give up. - Your things are on the beach, Helen. - Thank you, Nancy. - Uh, is Judy there? - Yes. She's waiting for us. - You call me when you're ready to go down. - I will. - Some more tea, Helen? - Yes, thank you. - Is Nancy staying with you? - No,no. She comes by and takes me down to the beach and picks me up later in the afternoon, -whenever she can get away from the hospital. - Mm-hmm. I'm going to miss you terribly, Ed. Well, I hate to say good-bye, but I've refused the gallery so many times, and I do have to be in Chicago at least once this year. Well, you've been wonderful all these months, and I want to apologize for being a handful a couple of times. Uh-uh, Helen. Quiet. Well, I'd have thrown me in the drink, if I were me. Thank you. But, Ed, I get so tired of learning how to eat, and dressing, and finding out where the heck things are. I get so tense, and then I'm a problem to everybody. Well, of course you have to have people around to help you. - So do several geniuses that I could mention. -[chuckles] - But you're such a good friend. -[teacup clattering] - And don't forget that. - No. Sorry I had to miss Joyce. But you'll say good-bye for me, won't you? Yes, I will. She's in town. It's something about that accident insurance. Thank goodness for that. It's kept us going. Well, good-bye. You'll be hearing from me. God bless you. I'll get Nancy. No, not yet. Where's my radar? No,no,no. As a farewell present for you, I'm going to try something. For the first time, in your honor, down to the cove all by myself. Oh, but, Helen, you've never gone down there alone. Oh, well, it's about time I start, isn't it? Oh, please, Helen. I'd better go partway with you. Oh, no. You just stay and watch. I know these steps by heart. - One, -[cane tapping] Two, three - Helen? Where did Helen go? - That's progress for you. - It's remarkable. - Judy? - Hi, Helen. Say, what do you know? You started exploring by yourself. How about that? I'm sorry I'm late, Judy. Me too. I got to get back early. I thought you weren't coming, so I went ahead and read the whole chapter. Well, that serves me right for being late. What happened? Well, old Huckleberry's on this crazy raft with Jim, you know, and they run into this old deserted houseboat. - Huck - Here's a step. - Oh. All right. Thank you. One, two, three, four, five steps. Now, let's see. Where was I? Oh, yes. Huck thinks maybe they can scrounge somethin', so he starts to investigate in all this dirt and disorder, and he opens this door and finds two fellows talking in a very rough fashion. Oh, here we are. - Take it easy now. -[grunts] These characters are very hostile indeed. And? Tune in tomorrow - same time, same station. Shall do. What's going on out on the lake, Judy? Oh, I'd say there's about a ten-knot blow, and about a half a dozen snipes havin' a race, and a couple of stars foolin' around by the yacht club, and a real gone daddy zoomin' around with his inboard. Aw, some babe's water-skiin'. Not so hot. She's usin' both hands. Sounds like a big day. Yeah. I hate to rush, Helen, but okay if I do the newspaper now? Well, sure. But what's the hurry? Oh, Mother stuck me with Susan Shacker's birthday party. - Can you imagine me in a dress? -[chuckling] Well, in Europe things aren't so hot, and in the Pacific things aren't so hot, and in Washington - If you really want to know my opinion, Helen, -things are pretty fouled up all over. -[laughs] Page three. Here's a girdle and bra ad, which I won't be needing for quite a while now. I'm a dog to run off, I know, but what can you do with parents, eh, Helen? Nothing, I guess. But we'll be together tomorrow. Sure. Want me to take you back up? No, I think I'll sit here for a while. I'm all right, Judy. Okay. You're a big girl now. - See ya. - Bye. Hey, handsome. Yeah, you, Tarzan. I'm stuck. Want to help me launch my boat? I always say a girl's in real tough shape when she's got no figure and no muscles either. Thanks. Stick around. I think we can use you. Bye, Helen. Bye. Thank you for your help. - Sure. - I didn't know anyone else was here. Do you come to the cove often? Well, lately a little. I've noticed you and Judy a few times. Well, I'm Mrs. Phillips. And I hope any friend of Judy's is a friend of mine. How do you do, Mrs. Phillips? - And you're? - Rob - My name's Robinson. Well, you know, it's a bit chillier than I thought. Oh, dear, I - I'm sorry, but would you help me find my shawl? I don't see. Of course. I'm very awkward, I guess, but Judy's a wonderful builder-upper. I don't think anybody could come through any better than you have, Mrs. Phillips. After all, with a subdural hematoma like yours - Why, that's where I've met you - at the hospital. - You're a doctor. - No. We've never met. I know a little about medicine. I studied to be a surgeon once. But I have heard your voice, haven't I? I don't think so, Mrs. Phillips. - Is there anything else I can do? - No, thank you. I'm very comfortable. Mrs. Phillips, I wonder. Would it be all right if I came by occasionally? Just for launching outboards and general morale purposes. I hope you won't think I'm imposing. Well, of course not. We'll hope to see you again very soon. Yes. Soon. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. [engine starts] [car departs] I hope that I've been able to make myself clear. What you say you want to do is the best news that anyone could tell me. But I warn you - The investment of one's life in others, and the alignment of one's self with the forces that lead up and on - this does not come cheap. - I don't expect it to be. - Once you go into it, you're bound. You'll never be able to give it up. You'll find this furnishes your motive power. It will obsess you. Believe me... it'll be a magnificent obsession. - Thank you, Williams. - Uh, Mr. Masterson is here. Oh? Uh-huh. Any mail? - Yes, sir. On your desk. - Fine. - Sorry I'm late. - I haven't been waiting long. - Cigarette? - Yes. Thank you. How are our plans developing? I made the last deposit to Mrs. Phillipe's account today. - Sit down. - That completes the amount you wanted paid. Good. Any problems? No, but, uh... Joyce asked some very pertinent questions. It is a lot of money. But I think they're both convinced it was an insurance settlement. - You haven't mentioned this to anyone? - No one. Good. - You don't approve of me, do you? - Well, I, uh - Everybody knows that Perkins & Little have been the Merrick attorneys for years. So I thought it a little strange when you called me last month. That's why. Nobody would suspect any double-talk from you as originating with me. And you can start practicing some more, because here comes a high, fast one. I've been talking with Dr. Giraud at the Medical Center. - He's the brain man, isn't he? - He's the brain man. Best diagnostician in the country. I once studied with him. He says there's some chance - a very, very small chance - that Helen Phillipe's prognosis may not be completely negative. Really? He says that if doctors like Emile Hofer in Zurich - - Oh, yes. -...Fuss in Vienna, Layman in Munich, could be persuaded to take her case, they might be able to devise a way to operate. But you couldn't get them all together over here in a million years. - Couldn't we get her over there? - Yes, but - All right. Hofer won't leave Zurich, so it'll have to be Switzerland. Today Dr. Giraud heard from Fuss. He and Layman could arrange to be in Switzerland this spring for periodic consultations. They're willing to tell her they're taking the case as a gesture to her late husband. You get all kinds of people to do what you want, don't you, Merrick? I think it's fine, but, uh, what about the expense? Somebody will have to be with her all those months. You could persuade her and Joyce to sell the house, couldn't you? - Who'd buy it? - I know somebody who needs a place exactly like that. He'll pay what some people might think is a lot more than it's worth. Think it over. Figure out the best way to present it all to her. Of course, don't let anyone know about this either. - No one. - No. Uh, of course not. Uh, what are you going to do with the house? I don't want any part of it. You'll find a worthy use for it. Merrick, I, uh - I take back a lot of things I thought about you. That's nice of you to say so. [chuckles] What's all this? False knots. One of the first things you learn in med school. You are wrapped up in this. Well, good-bye. I'll be talking to you. Thanks. I'll find my way out. You know, of course, what you're asking. To change your manner of living, which is your business. But also to pick up a career which you'd dropped. Probably the most demanding career you could choose anyway. And if you don't go on this time, you've tied up some very good people and some priceless facilities, which is my business. I'm still asking it. Dr. Giraud, if I can go back and graduate, will you let me intern here at the Medical Center? All right, Bob Merrick. We try it. In my time, I've done a lot of things in medicine people warned me were impossible. You won't regret it, Doctor. When you were studying with me, years ago, why weren't you so enthusiastic? What a lot of time you've wasted. Yes. What a lot of time. Thank you, Doctor. First picture, the marshal gets on his white horse and rides off with Wise Eagle. The marshal says, "Wise Eagle, you reckon them varmints will head through the pass?" - Wise Eagle says - - "Ugh-." The marshal says, "We got to head 'em off. Come on." The next picture is in the sheriff's office. The marshal says, "Sheriff, what kind of idea you got in that ornery, no-good head of yours to stop them desperadoes?" The sheriff says - "Well, Marshal, I don't like usin' shootin' irons, but if I got to use shootin' irons, let me tell ya, there ain't no hombre this side of the Pecos that's any better with shootin' irons, lessen it's you." - And Wise Eagle says - - Oh. "Ugh." [Judy] Say, we're gettin' better, aren't we? Now, listen, you two. Forget about the funnies just a minute. I can't keep quiet any longer. Silence, Judith. Okay, Helen. Shoot. Well, first of all, some of the best eye doctors in Europe are interested in me because of my husband, I guess, and they want me to come over for a consultation. - Helen, I couldn't be happier. - Gee, that's marvelous. For free? Practically. But not the trip itself. That's the other good news. So many wonderful things have been happening lately. Do you know that we have the most fabulous offer for the house and the lake frontage? Enough for an income for Joyce and me. And if the buyer takes the Brightwood acreage, then the hospital will be in good shape too. It's about time your luck turned. You know, it's ironic. I've never been to Europe. And when I go, I won't be able to see it. But what a place to open your eyes. I'm going to have to leave by the end of the month for Switzerland. I'm gonna miss you two for a long time. Heck, Helen. I'll write. Heck, Helen. I'll write. Switzerland sounds dreamy. If you go there, you can get a Swiss watch and learn to yodel. She's practically lived on the beach this spring. This Robinson must be a real dreamboat. - Haven't you met him yet? - Oh, she's keeping him all to herself. [chuckles] Oh, I think it's wonderful. It looks as if they really mean a lot to each other. You know, it's very strange knowing you only like this. So well, it seems, and - and yet... I've never seen your face. - [Judy] Hi, Joyce. - [Joyce] Hiya, Judy. Any room left on the beach for us? - Sure. Are you kiddin'? - Helen, the news sounds just wonderful, but I'm afraid I have to go. Oh, no. No. Don't go, because it's Joyce, and now you'll have a chance to meet her. Joyce. Happy Sunday, Helen. Joyce dragged me along. At long last, everybody. This is Joyce Phillips, Tom Masterson, and this is Robbie Robinson I've been telling you so much about. - Hello. - How do you do, Mr. Robinson? How do you do? I'm sorry. I'm just on my way to the village. I'm glad to have met you. Don't forget tomorrow. Good-bye, Helen. Good-bye. - Mr. Robinson. - Joyce. Could I ask you a favor? - Tom. - Yes, Helen? - Tom, what's the matter? What's wrong? - Nothing, Helen. What is this? - Look, Joyce. You don't understand. - I sure don't. Hasn't she had enough trouble from you without this - this fantastic lie? Believe me, I'm only trying to make her life a little less lonely. You're doing fine. But wouldn't it be wonderful for her to fall in love with somebody named Robinson and then open her eyes and see that it's you? That would make us all glad we're living, wouldn't it? Get out, Merrick. Get out of her life, will you, and stay out. So long, partner. - Good-bye, Helen. - Good-bye, Torn. Come on, Helen. Good-bye, Torn. - Good-bye, Nancy. - Hurry up, Joyce. I love you, darling. - I'm coming. Good-bye, darling. - Write to me. Hello, Merrick. Everything's going to be all right. Now, Mrs. Phillips, will you tell me if you see a little light? DO you? No. Do you notice a light now? No. I'm sorry, gentlemen. [all speaking German] [doctors chattering in German] Mrs. Phillips, do you have headaches? - Uh, yes. - Constantly or periodically? Periodically. - Mm-hmm. Where? In the back of my head. AW dizzy Spells? Oh, occasionally. Difficulties in walking? No. No. Well, I think that does it for today. Well, Doctors, what's the verdict? You must be patient, Mrs. Phillips. You know, there are tests and tests. We are making progress. But I did distinguish some light yesterday. And it was the same test, wasn't it? What does it mean? If you can bear with us, madame, in time, we'll find out. Oh, I don't know how they dare call this tea. Back home it'd be a six-course lunch. Tsk, tsk. Why did I ever memorize that calorie chart? -[Helen chuckles] - I'm glad that's finished. Now I'm only three letters behind Tom. - You want some tea, dear? - Yes. Thank you, Nancy. - Joyce. - Yes? Joyce, I'd like to get a note off to Robbie Robinson, if it wouldn't be too much trouble. Well, no. Aren't you tired? It can wait, can't it, dear? What you should do is just rest and relax and not worry about your social obligations. - Yes, dear. - Oh, it's no obligation. I'm sure he's interested in what's going on, and I want it to make the next plane. Just a note, Joyce. And you can say, uh... that the tests have started, and we're all very optimistic. And, uh, tell him that I miss him... and to say hello to Judy. And the only part of Switzerland that we've encountered is a hospital. Encountered... is a hospital. How do you explain it, Doctor? Her letters sound so optimistic, yet your reports - Now, now, Bob. How long has she been there? A few weeks? Fuss and Hofer are the only ones who've ever seen her so far. Naturally their reports to us are going to sound cautious. Cautious? I'd say they were pessimistic. You mustn't worry so much. You know that everything which can be done for her is being done. I know. After all, we never anticipated more than a, uh - a medical possibility, now, did we? A medical possibility. Mrs. Phillips. Good morning. - You're Dr. Fuss? - Yes. Dr. Fuss. - Please, sit down, Mrs. Phillips. - Oh, and you're Dr. Hofer. - Jawohl. - Good morning, madame. - Oh, and - and you're Dr. Layman. - You're right. Now, you see? I'm beginning to recognize all of you. [chuckles] Well, at long last, the great day. I want you to know that I've shot the works too. - I beg your pardon? - Oh, that's American slang. - That means a new dress, a new hat. - Oh. [all chuckling] Now I want to know when you're going to make a new girl out of me. Mrs. Phillips, you have been close to medicine for a few years. You know the relationship of doctor and patient. You know that there is very little to be gained by not facing the facts. Wh-Why, of course. By all means, face the facts. What are they? We are very sorry, Mrs. Phillips, but we are agreed that, for the present, we can do nothing. No operation? Nothing? We've searched every avenue, I believe. That's not to say there is no hope. In a case like yours, after several years, sometimes - Several years, Doctor? Mrs. Phillips, we feel that it would be unwise and unkind to submit you to surgery now. But you know that I'll let you experiment if there's any chance at all, the longest chance in the world. We regret to say, but the indications are not there. Oh. Well, if the indications aren't there, then... I guess that's that. You - You've done everything that you could. It - It was a gamble. We all knew that it was a gamble, and I just - Well, I - I just lost. That's all. But... I - I want to thank you. I want to thank you for being so kind to me and - and giving me all your time. I - I - I really can't thank you enough. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - And - - Good-bye, Mrs. Phillips. The last must be Dr. Layman. My child... I am so sorry. Well, I - I thought I was gonna get rid of these. Isn't it nice that - that I didn't throw them away? She's sound asleep. What has she done that all this happens to her? Golly. How she took it today. I don't know how she stands up under everything. If it happened to me, I'd go to pot in a handbasket. I think I even - I'm proud of you, Joyce. It hasn't been an easy year for you either. Well, I guess I'll go get these drops and this new prescription filled. - Nancy. - Hmm? - Do me a favor. - Of course. What? Stay away from here for a while and... relax yourself for a change. All right. I do need some fresh air. I'll be back in an hour. [doorknob turns] Darling, I thought you were asleep. Well, I heard the door. Was it Nancy? Oh, yes. She - She just went out for a while. Why don't I get you one of your pills and some hot milk? Oh, Joyce, I don't need any sleep. Oh, yes, I do too. It's so awful in bed. It's funny, but... the nighttime is the worst time. It does get darker, you know. And then, when I finally do get to sleep, I - I know that when I wake up in the morning, there won't be any dawn. [Joyce sobs] Joyce. Joyce, forgive me. I didn't mean to parade my emotions. Maybe I do need a pill. Would you mind getting me some warm milk? Of course not. Just - Just sit down here. I'll only be gone a moment. I'll just go down to the hotel kitchen and warm some milk. - Are you all right? - Yes, dear. I'm all right. [chorus vocalizing] [vocalizing continues] [vocalizing continues] [flowerpot shatters] [sobbing] [knocking] [knocking continues] Joyce? No. It's Rob. Rob. Oh, I can't believe it. - It's been so long. - Much too long. Oh, and you didn't come to the plane. And you hardly wrote all these months. - Oh, I'm so glad you're here. -[door opens] You must have known how much I need you now. [Merrick] Darling. Robbie, my trip's been wasted. I just found out today that my case is hopeless. Don't talk about it. I came to tell you you're gonna have the time of your life with me. I'm gonna take you to all the places you've been too busy to visit. - I'm gonna show you how to have fun in Europe. - But I'll be such trouble. Listen, Helen. You used to let me read the funnies to you. - Oh, yes. - Let me be your eyes again. Now get dressed - something to bowl everybody over. I'm not only gonna show you the town. I'm gonna show the town you. Oh, Robbie. Joyce? Joyce? Yes, Helen? Look who's here. Robbie Robinson. It's like old home week. - This is a surprise. Hello. - Hello. We're gonna get dressed up to the teeth. I'm going to initiate that new net dress. Joyce, will you please come and help me? - Watch it. - Oh. Oh, I'm all right. I won't be very long. - I'll be back in just a moment, Helen. - All right, Joyce. Bob Merrick, I - I want to apologize. You? For what? That girl you just saw is... quite a change from the girl this afternoon. They told her she's never going to see. I know. I just came from the institute. They've been keeping in touch with me. Anybody that can do what you've done for her is okay with me. I never believed names were too important anyway. - Joyce. - Coming. [door opens] It's wonderful being with you. I don't want it to end - ever. Well, let's not think of it. Tonight is our night. Yes, tonight is our night. Oh, and the fragrance in the air. What is it? Lilacs? - Mm-hmm. - Ah. And there's a moon, as there should be. Oh, and just ahead, there's lights of a little, old town. - Just as there should be. [chuckles] -[chuckles] -[crowd chattering] -[accordion playing folk tune] - Excuse me a second, darling. - Yes. {Speaking German] "[German] I thought you might like these. - Lilacs? - Mm-hmm. For love. - Oh. - Und more lilacs. -[music continues] -[chattering continues] - What's going on? - Oh, I don't know. Let's find out, shall we? -[German] - Yes. -[German] - Oh, it's a local festival. -[German] - They're burning a witch. -[German] - For a good harvest. - Mit Musik und Feuerwerk. - With music and fireworks. [all laugh] [crowd chattering] There she is, darling. Way up on top a pile of branches about 20 feet high. Poor old gal is stuffed with straw, just like one of our scarecrows back home. Oh, and on the ground just below her, boys and girls in peasant dress are dancing. [shouting, laughing] Now they're setting fire to her. [fireworks popping] There she goes. Fireworks bursting all over the place. [man shouts] Now everybody's starting to dance. - I'd like to dance too. - You would? I always danced with my eyes closed anyway. [romantic waltz] [clock chiming] [cuckooing] - I won't tell you what time it is. - I don't want it to stop. I don't want to lose this place - or the music or the night. You don't have to lose it. I'd forgotten how happy I could be. You've helped me know that the world isn't such a bad place after all. You don't hate it anymore? Not anymore. Could you forgive anything now? I think so. Yes. Even Bob Merrick? Why... Yes, Bob. Of course. How long have you known? Well, I don't really remember when I first had the feeling, but - Does it really matter? I love you. And I want to marry you. Oh, darling, if we only could. But I couldn't have you pitied because of me. I - I love you too much. Helen, I need you more than anything. Bob - Tomorrow. Let me tell you tomorrow. -[waltz continues] - All right. Starting tomorrow, we'll never be apart. Tomorrow. Well? - It's really good night this time. - Oh, I wish it weren't. [clock chiming] There's a brand-new day in a few hours. - Even better. - Nothing could be better, darling. [chuckles] I love you. Oh, Bob. Oh. The key. [chuckles] - The key. - Ah. Helen. - Did you have a good time? - I had a wonderful time. - How pretty. - Good night. Good night. - I'll see you in the morning. - Yes. - Good night. - Good night, Nancy. I'll take the flowers, Helen. Oh, they're so pretty. It was too wonderful, Nancy. He wants to do so much for me. Helen. What's the matter? He wants to marry me, Nancy. I love him. I can't let him do it. - Well, if you love him and he loves you - - Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I - I don't know anything anymore. - Nancy, please don't leave me. - Of course, dear. I won't leave you. You've got to help me. Helen? Nancy? Where is everybody? [phone rings] Hello? Oh, yes, please. Have him come up. Helen, Rob - Hello? G-Get - Get me the desk, please. Come in. - I see. - Good morning. Couldn't order a better day if we tried, could we? Thank you. Thank you very much. Is Helen dressed? I hope you're not allergic to lilacs. - Bob. - Hmm? What happened to you two last night? Did you tell her who you were? Yes. But she knew anyway. Joyce. I, uh, asked her to marry me. Oh, Bob. - She's gone. - She's - - Where? - I don't know. Away with Nancy, early this morning. Oh, here. She left this note for you. "Dear Bob, Good-bye. I'm sure this is best for both of us. You have your study and work now, and I could only be a burden. If you love me, don't try to find me. Just know you made me happier than I dreamed I could ever be again. Helen." I phoned downstairs. Nobody knows where she went. - Come on. We've got to go after her. - But, Bob - We'll talk about it on the way. I've got to find her. Miss Phillips, Mr. Merrick, I'm sure you understand we are doing everything to trace them, as are the police all over Europe. But from Milano, nothing to report. Paris, no findings. Rome, nothing. You'd think that in five weeks we'd be able to find some trace. I'm truly sorry, sir. But, you know, even in your country, if someone really wants to disappear, it is not too difficult. However, we shall not give up. - Thank you, Captain. Good-bye. - Good-bye. I know what a sense of loss and disappointment you both have, but look at these telegrams. Our Inter-Europe Agency has tried everything, I assure you. [Speaking German] We have exhausted all possibilities, believe me. -[phone rings] - Just a second. Inter-Europe. [speaking French] But we will be in touch with our New York people, and I will keep on the lookout here for the two of them booking passage to America. Here are your tickets. Bon voyage. Have a nice trip. It was a pleasure serving you. [crowd chattering] Darling, you're home. Oh, am I glad to see you. - Welcome home, Bob. - Hello, Tom. Good to see you. Nothing? No trace? None. She must come back to the States. Sooner or later, they'll get in touch. Strange how things work out, isn't it? - Yeah. Strange. - What are your plans? I don't know. I guess I'll... go up to Brightwood for a while. [Merrick's voice] The marshal gets on his white horse and rides off with Wise Eagle. The marshal says, "Wise Eagle, you reckon them varmints will head through the pass?" - Wise Eagle says - -[Helen's voice] "Ugh." - Mr. Merrick? - Yes. Mr. Randolph had to leave Brightwood for a few months. Will you excuse me? I just came over to close up the house. Yes. Certainly. [Randolph's voice] Once you go into it, you're bound. You'll never give it up. You'll find it'll furnish your motive power. It will obsess you. Believe me, it'll be a magnificent obsession. - Chris, here's Doctor. - Dr. Merrick. - All ready to leave us, Chris? - Sure am, Dr. Merrick. All set. - Good. - Let me down. I want to show you something. Oh, all right. Look at me. Not dizzy or anything. Boy, you sure know how to operate. Thanks, Chris, but Dr. Barnes had more to do with it than I did. And you know what? Now I can go to that new school out in the country. They got horses and dogs and everything. How about that? [chuckles] Well, that's just fine. Good-bye, Chris. Just a minute, Doctor. Chris, I want to talk to Doctor a minute. Dr. Merrick, you've been just wonderful to us. Not just here in the hospital. Chris is so excited about that school you arranged for him. And thanks to you, my husband starts to work at the plant next week. - You haven't told them that I had - - Oh, no. No. That's just between you and me, like you said, but, uh, in a few years, when Chris is old enough to understand about money - No, Mrs. Miller. I told you there's nothing to repay. - Oh. - In a few years it'll be all used up anyway. - All used up? - That's right, Mrs. Miller. Good-bye. Good-bye. Had quite an experience at the golf club the other day. Had quite an experience at the golf club the other day. What was that, Doctor? - After 20 years, I came within - - You mean a hole-in-one. [chuckles] I'd heard the food was very good, so I took her to this beautiful French restaurant. But all she wanted was spaghetti. - Bob Merrick. - Dr. Giraud. For heaven's sake, how are you? Bob, you're ten pounds underweight. And on you it looks fine. - Well, I feel fine. - Doctors, please. This is a very tense moment. - Check. - Say, what are you doing here? - You on a busman's holiday or something? - Just been seeing your chief. By the way, he tells me you did a nice job on that trephining. - I told him I taught you everything you know. -[chuckles] Looks like you're going to become a real neurosurgeon after all. That's the idea, Doctor. Never hurts to take time off to build up the batteries. Remember that. Oh, I took a week off. Had a vacation. Went to Joyce and Torn Masterson's wedding. - Oh? When was that? - Well, let's see. She's up in Maternity right now with the first baby, so it must have been a year ago. Maybe work is the best answer. You - You never heard anything again? No. I never heard from her. Supposedly she and Nancy came back to the States. “Nan on PM Dr. Merrick, please. Dr. Merrick. So you're being paged now. Must be an important man, Doctor. Don't stay away so long, Doctor. We need critics around here. Good-bye. [chuckles] Bye. But the book says if they don't gain their weight back in five days - Oh, book, schmook. There ought to be a law new fathers couldn't read anything. Life would be a lot simpler. -[knocking] - Come in. - Hello, Doctor. - Hello, Tom. How's the little mother? - A lot littler, thank you. - Doctor, I have a formal complaint. Two minutes after I get here, some nurse comes in and takes my baby away. Counselor, all you can supply is psychological nourishment. And she doesn't need that right now. Well, kids, I'm busy. Everything all right? - Fine. I go home Monday, I think. - Good. I'll look in on you tomorrow. Oh, uh, give little Helen an extra hug for me, will you? Sure. Bye, Doctor. He's doing his life over the hard way, isn't he? Oh, I imagine any other way would be the hard way now. - Good evening, Doctor. - Good evening, Williams. Thank you. - Hello, Bob. - Edward Randolph. Good to see you. How long have you been here? I phoned the hospital. They said you were on your way home. And, uh - What is it? Helen. Do you know where she is? Nancy called. Said she was breaking her word. Thank goodness she did. - Helen must be desperately ill, Bob. - What? They're afraid of pneumonia, other complications. - Where are they? - In a little hospital in New Mexico. Shadow Mountain. Oh, I've already called about tickets. - How soon can we leave? - There's a 9:00 plane. We can get there at dawn. Doctor, that's their car. - Oh, at last you're here. - Finally. - Right or wrong, I've only done what she asked me. - I know. How is she? In a coma. No change. Nothing since you called from the airport. - Dr. Allan, Dr. Merrick. - How do you do, Doctor? - Mr. Randolph. - How do you do? This way, Doctor. Nancy. [sniffles] She was admitted a month ago. May I see the history, please? It's the pneumococcus now. When she was admitted, headaches, nausea, and apparently not connected with her blindness at all. This pressure. Have you done spinal puncture? One. Starting yesterday, she deteriorated so fast, we had to. Another odd thing - this apparent paralysis of the left arm and the respiratory center. Couldn't be a stroke. The onset was so gradual. No. But it could be a fibroma. Her old injury. I know something about it, Doctor. Might have caused a clot which became organized and fibrotic. [Helen murmurs] [mumbling] I've... always danced with my eyes closed. Well, Doctor, what do you suggest? If we could only get Henry Giraud to fly out here. There isn't time for that. Is there? No, there's no time for that. I agree. You should operate as soon as possible. Let's have a look at Surgery. - Doctor. - This way? Doctor, I couldn't do it. - I've never used a Hudson Burr. -Isn't there anyone else? Here? Why, this is just a private Sanitarium, Doctor. Four of us on the staff. Not one of us could take that responsibility. - Do you want it? - I? I don't have enough experience. - You can't expect me to - - Bob. Chance in a thousand. Chance in a million. You've got to give it to her. Edward, I can't. You're not gonna let everything you've lived for all these years slip away. You've gone so far, Bob. So far. I'd give my life to save her. You just give your skill. You're ready for it. Now you're going to repay that old, old debt in a way that you never imagined. Nancy, will you help scrub? I'll be glad to, Doctor. Remove the dressing. Two eds Pentothal sodium. Almost ready, Doctor. Dr. Merrick. What's the trouble? Doctor, you begin. I'll stand by. Just a moment, please, Doctor. You can't let that girl down. You just can't. Nancy, I'm not up to it. I just won't be able to. [chorus vocalizing] Nancy, let's start. - Ready? - Go ahead. All right, Doctor. [instruments clatter] [no audible dialogue] It's the longest and roughest operation I ever saw. Pretty feathery there for a while, wasn't it? It's going to be feathery until she comes to. - You'd better get some rest now. - No. Thank you, Nancy. I couldn't sleep. I'll make some coffee for you. All right. [Helen murmurs] Doctor. Nancy. Nancy's here. I'm here. - Doctor. - Yes. You must be quiet. It doesn't hurt so much. You're going to get better. Who is it? Who's here? It's Bob. Bob? Oh, Bob, I'm so glad you're here. Hold me. Hold me close. I didn't know. You didn't tell me. Lie still. Please. What is that? Helen, you've got to be quiet. But I think I see some light. Are you sure? You mustn't talk. Just rest. But I'm going to see. I know I am. Am I? Yes, my darling. You are going to see. I can see you. Please lie still. You must. Don't get excited. Not today. M-May I - May I get excited tomorrow? Yes. And you'll be with me? Yes, darling. I'll be with you tomorrow. Starting tomorrow, we'll never be apart. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Oh. Oh, tomorrow. [Randolph's voice] Once you find the way, you'll be bound. It will obsess you. But believe me, it'll be a magnificent obsession. [chorus vocalizing]
