Walton Street. The name's Steve Garry. KEY WITNESS MISSING Steve Garry fails to appear in Gould wife murder trial. 101 Walton St. Very well, he's either out or he's asleep. Bachelors never sleep. I'll get the passkey from the superintendent. - That's it? - That's it All right, Garry, open up, Sheriff's Office! We'll have to use the key. Hey, Jack! - Where does that door lead to? - To the back hall. But he wouldn't go out that way. There he goes! Then we tried to seal every escape from the alley. But he slipped through. Get on the teletype. Police on all western cities. Photos, descriptions, ...give them everything you've got to make it strong. Steve Gerry's got to be found. - Yes, sir. HOMICIDE DIVISION Los Angeles Police Department Eyes brown, hair dark brown. Wanted here as important missing witness in Gould murder trial. Donovan, that's the photo they sent down. Oh, what's the inside on this Captain? Well, you can find out, Lou. If you read a little further than the comic strips. I've got enough reading with our own murders, ...now it's gotta be a Missing Persons Bureau in San Francisco. Hey, don't ask us a lot of favors, eh? Well, there's in your lap, boys. Just one face. One face in one million nine hundred and fifty four thousand. - Hello, Fred. - How's my favourite school teacher? - Hello, Virginia. - Steve! Close the door, will you? You've added housebreaking to your other talents? I came here because I had to. I know. I read all about you in the papers. Papers told you why I left, but not why I came here. Whatever it is, I don't wanna hear about it. It's over for us. I'm not exactly on friendly terms with the police. I'm in Los Angeles to hide out. - Find some other place. - I'm going to. But I need a few hours. I thought I could count on you to give me a break. A break? That's fine coming from you. What kind of a break did you give our marriage? That was another guy, Virginia. I've changed now. What you've done and what you do is not my business anymore, Steve. I'm not gambling. It wasn't just my money you gambled away. It was our future. Every chance of having a home and a secure marriage. Those things are gone now. Words won't bring them back. Virginia... I don't blame you, I can't blame you for not believing me, but... Here's something you can believe. Hey, you see? 600 dollars deposit in the bank every month. I couldn't do that if I were still gambling. Our divorce wasn't because of an empty bank book. It's because of a man I couldn't trust. I wish I could explain without the police breathing down my neck I hope to, but... I'm trying to prove I'm not the same man anymore. I straighten myself up, Virginia, I, I... ...I've got a good solid job in San Francisco... ...with Phil Gould in the charter boat business. You have to believe me. The life of my friend depends on this. That's the reason why I had to come here. You doing something to help somebody else, you certainly have changed. Phil Gould is my best friend. And how can you help him by hiding in Los Angeles? Why weren't you with him when he needed you? If I were, he wouldn't have a chance. You see... Phil and his wife used to fight like wild cats. I was out with him the night before she was found dead. That was the night they had their big blow up. The D.A. know all this. If he got me on the stand and drag any part of that story out of me, ...Phil will go to the gas chamber. I see. No, you don't see. The way you say it, you think Phil is guilty just as they all do. But he's not. If you never believed anything I ever told you before, you've got to believe that. It doesn't make any difference what I believe. You have to go. You've got room here. If I could just stay here tonight. I'll find some place to go tomorrow. You'll have to find it now. Can't you remember anything except the old mistakes? There were good things too, Virginia. You turned them into lies. Not all of them. Not the way I thought about you, that hasn't changed. I don't know, Steve, because... ...I don't know you anymore. Try to know me, try to find out. Go to the kitchen. I'll see who he is. Oh, Virginia. Could you lend me a couple of dollars till tomorrow? Well I, I... Certainly, Phoebe. Thank you so much. Oh, if you're going out, I'll walk you to the corner. All right, Phoebe, I'll meet you outside in a minute. Oh, all right. It was Phoebe, my neighbour from across the court. You can stay here tonight. But that's all. Thanks. I have to get some food? there's nothing in the house. There's anything to drink? Oh, it's been a rough night. I'll see. I'd like a small bottle of whisky, please. That'll be fine. How much is it? Two dollars. Just for today. Take it out of it. Sergeant McCloy. Remember me? Used to date your roommate Dolores. Oh, yes, Mr. McCloy. Thank you, I'll pay myself. No, you wouldn't argue against a pal buying a lady a drink, will you? The bottle is not for me. No? A new roommate may be? No, Mr. McCloy, I'm living all alone now. Alone? A pretty school teacher alone and unprotected? Looks like I'd better see you home. - No, thanks, I'm quite all right. - Oh, you can say that again, ...but I'm not the man that let a... ...nice girl go wandering around the streets by herself. I'm sorry, but I had to go right away. Well, that's fine, I'm off duty and my car is parked right outside. Now, wait a minute, baby. I bought you that bottle, didn't I? And you're welcome to keep it. Now, please, will you let me get into my car? Ok. No hard feelings. I'll take a rain check on that drink together. What do you say? - Here it is, Steve. - I'll take it. Nothing fancy, but it'll be quick to prepare. You are wonderful. It's starting to rain. Sorry, there isn't any bottle. I had one for you, but I ran into a detective who use to date Dolores. My ex-roommate. - It's pretty high and hard to get rid of. - A detective! That's all I need. There's nothing to worry about now. It's plenty to worry about, my photograph may be in the evening paper. Put the food in the kitchen while I get rid of my coat. Oh, it's probably Phoebe again. Stay in here while I get rid of her. - Mr. McCloy! - Hello, honey. You know, I kind of had you on my conscience. Please, stop annoying me, you can't come in. I'm already in, honey. You wouldn't turn me out in the rain now, would you? I came back on account of that bottle. So kind of bad taking it away like that. I figured... ...you might need it. In case you were entertaining. Say! You fixed the place up since Dolores left. You have to go now, Mr. McCloy. I'm going out and have to change right away. That's fine. I'll jus sit down right here and have a nice quiet one for the road. There's a glass and ice in the kitchen. You don't have to tell me where the kitchen is. I know my way around here. Have your drink and... And then you'll have to go. Maybe that'll be the last of him. That's not the idea on the sound of this voice. Go in there quick. Brought you a shorty, Virginia. Now you've had enough. And so have I. If you don't get out of here I'll... - What will you do, Baby? Yell? Call the cops? Don't try that innocent stuff with me. You wanna play rough. Steve! Steve... So you had to go out tonight, eh? Innocent little school teacher. Come on you! I wanna take a look at you. Steve! Steve, watch out! He's all right, isn't he? No, he isn't, Virginia. But you couldn't help it, he would have killed you. We'll have to phone the police. Is nothing else we can do, is there? I don't know. If we can only tell them what happened. It was an accident. Accident... Wait a minute! Wait a minute... I hope nobody heard the shot. It's all clear out here. The sound could have come from the radio, couldn't it? We could plug the bullet hole. How are we going to phone the police? Not yet, Virginia. We can't hide a killing. I brought this trouble on you, I'll take care of it. First thing to do is to take him out of here. I'll use his car. McCloy is full of liquor, the police will think is a drunk driving accident. Then I'll be able to keep you out of this mess. But I'm part of it. It's because of me you got into the fight with McCloy. We're in this together. I won't have you mixed up in it. If necessary, I'll go to the police myself. Even if it means giving up to protect Phil. Then you really wanted to help him. I think you have changed, Steve. I'll get him out of here. Will you bring his car around to the back door? And I'll come back here. If it is all right with you. Wait till no one see us from the front. Open the car door. Open the car door! Get his hat and coat quick. Hey, those fellows sure are in a hurry. What do you think it is? A smashup, a fight or a fire. There's not much left here. - Where they got the body? - It fell off, further up the hill. Come on, Ben. No pictures now, Bob. We'll give you a break later. Oh, get out of here! - Hiya, Sergeant. - Hiya, Frank. He must have pitched out when the car rolled over. We found him wedged against that tree. Oh, it's McCloy, all right. I never would've tagged him to get dead in an automobile accident. How well you know him, Will? Too well, he was my partner for three years. This is all his stuff. Have a look at his gun. - Who found him? - I did. We followed the tracks of his car up the hill and... ...found him there. Ed... One shot has been fired. I want a paraffin test right away. - Have you come up with nything, doc? - Plenty. Death caused by skull fracture. I think he's been dead for about four or five hours. If your timing's right, he was dead long before his car hit the bottom. I never figured McCloy as a man who'd drive up lonely hill tops... ...without company. He couldn't have driven at all. Do you have any theories, doc, as to the cause of the fracture? Well, we'll know better after the coroner's check up. Well, I'll talk to you later. Those footprints we found on top of the hill... ...were headed some place in a hurry. - We're able to make it a cast. - Just about. I'd say the man weighed about a hundred and seventy pounds. It's the same size as McCloy's. Either this guy knows that McCloy was up here and came back from... Or he killed McCloy first and drove him up in his car. Last night was, was his night off, wasn't it? Off or on, he only had one thing in his mind: a skirt. Well, it's all yours and poisoned. What's it, Steve? I don't know, it's something outside the door. It's just the newspaper. Maybe it's something in it about... I searched the whole place looking for something to plug... ...that hole that would match this ceiling. And the best thing I could find was this kitchen soap. How does it look? I'd never know there was anything there. Another thing's been bothering me. If McCloy's body got burnt in the fire, ...how will we be able to prove that he was full of liquor? It's like waking up with a bad dream. Yeah, I know. I'll put some coffe on. Nothing on the front page. Steve! What is it? It's al right, Virginia. I know how you feel. We won't have to go through this much longer. The trial is almost over. Then we can go to the police and tell them everything. Don't you think it's about time you... ...left for work? I guess I'd better call them and tell them I'm not well. No, Virginia. It's got to be the same as any day and any week. Nothing different, nothing changed. You see that, don't you? Yes. Come on, you'd better get your clothes changed. I'll fix the coffee. You still take three sugars, don't you? Yes. You're gonna be a nice little boy, aren't you? Then you know we're doing the big eating. Here you are. Oh, good morning, Virginia. I was just thinking of paying you a visit. - How are you, Phoebe? -All right. Oh, you're looking a little tired, aren't you well? I had trouble getting asleep. Oh, I got asleep all right, but something woke me, a shot. Didn't you hear it? A shot? Well no, I don't think so. Well, of course I couldn't swear it but, ...I did hear something about ten o'clock last night. I asked Tom and Mrs. Henson, they didn't hear it either. Coming to think of it, I think I did hear that shot. It was on a mystery program on the radio. So that's what it was. How can you say? Come back here, Pancho. There's nobody in there, you silly fool. - Now.... - Good-bye, Phoebe, I'm late. What's the matter? What happens? You've been caught stealing again, Emil Gillis. Don't pretend to me you're asleep. Get up there! There's two detectives out there looking for you. But, Ginger, I haven't been stealing. Not since that one time. - You tell that to the police. Get in there and hurry up. Come on! Mr. Gillis? We'd like to ask you a few questions. Please, have a chair, Mr. Gillis. There must be some mistake, I haven't done anything. Liar! Mrs. Gillis, nobody's accusing your husband of anything. Once, two years ago, the company investigated me. But I was clear. Wouldn't you think that had teach him a lesson? It didn't happen again. We believe you, Mr. Gillis. You don't know him! Please, Ginger. Mr. Gillis, ...around midnight, most of your regular passengers... ...are workers on the late shift, aren't they? - Yes, sir. - They use monthly ticket books, don't they? - That's right. - How much of them didn't? - Well, let's see. About three. There were two at the Woodside station and one at the Lansing station. And that's absolutely all the dimes I collected in the hills. - All men? - Two of them. One old guy short and fat. I've seen him before. - And the other? - Well... He was about average height, good looking. Didn't wanna talk much. Can you guess his age, and his weight? He can't even guess his own! Oh, I'd say about thirty odd. And maybe a hundred and seventy. - Good. How was he dressed? Well, let's see... He was wearing a trench coat. Yes, sir, I remember him perfectly. Got my bus full of mud. He acted real nervous too. Like he was trying to cover up something. That you would know from experience. Where did he get off the bus? Hollywood and Hyland. I don't know where he went from there. That's very good, Mr. Gillis. What time was that? Twelve twenty seven. I've got an schedule. Do you think you could... ...recognize him if you saw him again? Yes, sir. As plain as the Liberty head on a dime. He'd recognize that all right. Thanks very much, Mr. Gillis. You've been very helpful to us. We... We may call on you again. Oh, any time I can help the police department. Yes, sir. Oh, pardon, ma'am. Police officers. We're looking for a young lady by the name of Dolores Alden. She moved away two months ago. But there's the girl Dolores roomed with, she might be able to help you. Virginia. These gentlemen are from the police. - ?Yes? - They are looking for Dolores. We're sorry to disturb you, but we're anxious to find Miss Alden. Did she leave a forwarding address? Yes, she did. I'll get it for you. Here, you'd better let me help you with that. Oh, it's so silly about misplacing my keys. Here they are. Thank you, I'll take the packages now. I'll help you inside with them. Just put the packages down anywhere, please. Hey, what's this? That's a good looking boat. It's a model of the one my father owned. - Here's the new address. - Oh, thanks very much. D'you mind if I ask you a few question about her? Just routine. - No. Did she live here long? Only two weeks. I hope she's not in any trouble. - So do I. Her name and this address were in this book. It was in the pocket of a detective by the name of McCloy. He was murdered early this morning, we found his body in a hillside. So, we thought... ...Dolores might be able to tell us something about him. Did he come here often? Only once. Then you did meet him. Yes, but only very briefly. Dolores had quite a few men friends. Was one of them dark, ...rather good looking about medium height? I don't remember any one like that. Well... Perhaps Miss Alden will. Ed, the... ...woman across the way thought he heard a shot about ten last night. She said you told her you heard it on the radio. Is that right, Miss? Yes. That's very possible. I'm sorry we had to disturb you, miss... Merrill. Virginia Merrill. Miss Merrill. Thanks for being so nice. They're gone, Steve. I heard them. Did you remember bring me some cigarrettes? There're some in one of the packages over there. Oh, that was a little close for comfort. I just couldn't keep them out. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Steve, I'm not very good at covering up and hiding things. I know it's been a little tough, Virginia. But we have to hold out a little longer. I wonder if we should. There isn't any other way. McCloy's death wasn't an accident to the police. But we know it was an accident. We do know it was an accident, don't we, Virginia? I'm sorry. I guess I just couldn't help it. Attagirl. I hope McCloy had a lot of numbers in that... ...little black book of his. They're taking plenty of time with that little blonde. I wonder if they're giving her the third degree. I don't know. I didn't get my degree at this college. Well, thanks, John. You never saw McCloy after that one night. Not me. I would rather go out with an octopus. And if you find the guy that killed him, ...I'd like to give him ten bucks reward and shake his hand. Well, I guess that's all. Oh, thanks for coming in. - Did the Alden girl get here yet? - Yes, sir. Well, send her in, the rest can go. You may go in now, miss Alden, the sergeant will see you. You two can leave. Good luck kids, I guess I've made the team. Have a chair, miss Alden. You shared an apartment with a Virginia Merrill. Not for long, sergeant. You see, she's the intellectual type and I'm what you'd call the emotional type. But she's a good jill. How did you happen to know her? We were in higschool together back home. I was between jobs and rent. So I asked her to help me out. While you were staying there you had a friend. Named McCloy, is that right? That depends on what you mean by the word 'friend'. I'm afraid this is more serious than you realize, miss Alden. In case you don't know that he was murdered. So I read in the paper. - How well did you know him? - Not as well as he would've liked. I hate affectionate drunks. Did he ever introduced you any of his men friends? No, sergeant, he was a lone wolf. Did he ever mentioned anything about... ...someone having a grudge against him? No, Sarge. On a date with a guy like that, the conversation is never complicated. They start out by telling you what they are gonna do for you. And they scream if you want a hamburguer. But they gladly buy you a liquor store. The autopsy showed he had enough in him to have loaded a carrier. Knowing what a natural lover he was, ...he was probably showing some woman his favourite view. Her husband neglected to stay out of town. So McCloy got caught on the wrong hilltop. Thank you, miss Alden. Your theory is about as good as any we've on hand. Oh, if there's any more questions, we'll get in touch with you. I hope I won't be seeing you. On business, that is. How did McCloy ever had the time to squeeze in his police work? I wonder if he was up on conduct charges. Probably pulled his pistol in a drunken brawl over a woman. Mister X caved in his skull, ...so he tried to cover up by faking the accident. You know? I have a hunch we're gonna uncover something pretty rotten. Maybe the department will be better off if this case went unsolved. But he was a policeman and someone did kill him. Sergeant Donovan, Homicide. What? You sure? Okay, thanks. I checked all radio and television stations and there was no shot fired... ...on any program around ten o'clock the night before last. Maybe we'd better question the people who thought they heard it. There's the bottle from McCloy's pocket. Better check the Sun Beam Liquor Store. While you question the pretty school teacher. You ought to be a detective, Lou. - Hello. - Hi. Did you ever see that before? No refunds, mister. Will you check your sales records for the day before yesterday? Oh, yeah. I... I, recollect selling that bottle. Let's see. Yeah, here it is. I remember. It was purchased by a good looking girl. - You know her name? No, I figure she lives in the neighborhood, though. I've seen her in the market section before. Was she alone when she bought this bottle? She was at first, ...and then some fresh guy came up and paid for it. Said something about knowing a roommate. Kind on his late forties, uh, ...wearing a hand painted necktie? Yeah! Yeah, that was him. I figured what he said about the roommate was sort of a... ...get-acquainted line. Yeah, well you figured wrong. Do you have a pay phone around here? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Here, you can use mine. Thanks. Why! This bottle sure looks like it went through a long time. Yeah, it went through a murder. Homicide. Ezra. Brecker. I wanna check up on Virginia Merrill. Three, five, four Benton. Yeah. Right. Murder? You sure can't trust those innocents looking ones, can you? Oh, I don't know, ...that's not my job. Eh... That's for the phone. - Oh, that's all right, I... How do you like it here? Very much. But I still can't understand why you asked me. Well, it seemed the best way of finding out if you'd come. Why shouldn't I? Well, lots of reasons. You might not like having lunch with a.... detective. - And the others? - Well, you.... You might have thought the invitation was purely... ...police business. Isn't it? May be we'd better postpone the business... ...until at least after we've had lunch. I didn't know detectives ever postpone business. You know?, you've got a lot to learn. And maybe your education should start right now. - I'll concentrate very hard. - Good. First of all, ...the popular conception is that detectives are hard-bitten... ...flip guys. Fast with their fists and fast with their women. - Are they? - No. No, they're not. Most of them are actually human beings. Of course, they're working hours a little irregular, ...they have to associate with all kinds of people. But, somehow... Somehow they even worry about some other people who get into trouble. You know, I've even heard of detectives who got married, ...and became pretty good at doing dishes. Well, they say school teachers can be very human too. Exactly, even I had school teachers all wrong. The first one I met I thought she was made of chalk... ...and spent all her time off practicing... ...how to beat her pupils over the knuckles with a ruler. Of course, I was a little younger then and had strong knuckles. - Now you've changed your opinion? - Completely. - Then you'll do me a favor? - Sure, sure. You brought me here to ask me a lot of questions. I'd like to get over with it before lunch arrives. Okay. You win. Win until I slip on my badge. Now... You said you heard a shot on a mystery program, ...do you happen to remember what program that was? No. But are you sure you heard one at all? Well, there was some sound... I thought it could have been a truck backfiring in the street. But, didn't you tell your neighbor you heard one on a mystery program? Well yes, I guess I did. Phoebe thought she heard a shot and... ...and I thought it might put her mind at rest. In case it had been a shot. But, of course, I didn't really think there was any. You're right. For your information we checked and there was no shot... ...fired on any program around ten o'clock the night before last. Now, that wasn't so bad, was it? Maybe we should do some investigating on these dishes. Oh, yes, let's. Looks wonderful. But first... First we should read our fortunes. A long nose smells only trouble. Tall handsome stranger will enter your life. Oh, boy, it's good! I heard the car, why you used the back door? I don't think I could've stood another Phoebe's quiz programs. Phoebe's already been asked this afternoon. Who was it, Steve? One of those detectives who were here yesterday. He was nosing around, talking to a lot of people. Looks like the bloodhounds have dug up a bone. I know. What do you know? There's nothing to worry, you only... Only what? - Steve, you're hurting me. - Oh, sorry, I'm getting kind of jumpy. You're not very good hiding things, Virginia. I wasn't going to hide anything. Sergeant Donovan came to the school, he asked me out to lunch. - And you went? - How could I help it? You didn't have to fall for the bait. Can't you see he was trying to mix you up in a lot of questions? What did you think, maybe he was interested in the color of your eyes? I don't know, I don't know. He asked me about the shot and I answered him. Do you think I wanted to go? To sit there knowing he was examining every word... You could have been smart enough not to give him a chance to. Steve, what are you gonna do? I don't know. One of those detectives may be coming back here. And I'm not gonna be waiting here to find out. You'd better has to be here. Listen, honey. They can't tie you up in McCloy's killing if I'm out of here. So don't talk to anyone. Don't worry about anything and don't let them frighten you. I'll try. I'll find a place to stay and I'll phone you, letting you know where I am. We can't keep on hiding the truth much longer. The detectives are sure to find out something and then... Nobody is gonna find out anything until we tell them. And we can't tell them anything until the trial is over in San Francisco... ...and Phil is safe. I guess you're right. It'll be all right, Virginia. You wait and see. You wait here and we'll go to the police together. All right. If I only had a car, it'd be easier. You take mine. Here are the keys. You never let me down, do you, Virginia? Hello? Who, Dolores? I didn't recognize your voice. Virginia, I have something important to tell you. Can you meet me at the Club Pierre on La Brea in half an hour? Look, doll, I've said it's important. To you, so you'd better be there. Just ask for me. All right, Dolores. At the Club Pierre in half an hour. Sorry I had to drag you over here, honey. I couldn't get a way to meet you any place else. That's all right, Dolores. You work in a show? - Not this season. That's the photographic concession of the Club Pierre. Groups and individuals, two bucks the shot. And we do take tips. Kind of a long way from my Youngstown High School, isn't it? Cigarrette? - No, thanks. That's right, you don't smoke. How've you been, Dolores? Keeping body and soul together. But I didn't bring you over here to talk about myself. Sit down. You've got yourself in some kind of trouble, haven't you? Why no, Dolores... Look, you don't have to do a fan dance with me. I've been entertaining a few friends of yours. Friends? A couple of seeing-eye dogs. The cute one is called Donovan. Anayway, they knew we came from the same town, ...so they asked me a few questions about you. What did they want to know? Oh, just names, places, your family, your former husband. Hobbies... - My husband! I'm sorry, honey, I didn't know you wanted to keep it secret. Yes, I said you were once married to Steven Garry. But you haven't seen him since he got in that jam in San Francisco. Have you, Virginia? No, of course not. Look, honey. You once did me a favor when I needed a roof over my head. If there's anything I can do to help you now, ...I might be just the kid who could do it. Thanks, Dolores, but... ...I think it's just, just a routine investigation. Yeah, I've got the routine investigation too. About that McCloy character. I know. Well, I thought you could use the information. I'm very grateful. Remember, honey, ...I know a lot more about what happens outside the books than you do. So, if you need me, just give a yell. Thanks. Hi, Carol. So long. Mind if I come in too? Well, no. You startled me, I wasn't expecting to see you. I'm sorry, this isn't the kind of a visit I'd like. Wish this were a box of candy or some flowers. What is it? Open that up. Ever see it before? I don't know. You should; that's the bottle you bought at the Sun Beam liquor store... ...the night before last. Isn't it? Who paid for that bottle? McCloy. Why did McCloy wanna pay for it? I don't know, he wasn't a friend of mine. He knew Dolores. Yes, I know all about that. What I wanna know is where you and McCloy went... ...after you left the liquor store together. Didn't go anywhere. He wanted me to go out with him but I refused. I left him in the parking lot and came home alone. You're sure of that? Of course I'm sure. Now you don't believe anything I say, do you? I think you're covering for someone. Him. Your ex-husband, Steve Garry, ...was identified by a bus driver the night before last... ...in the vicinity where McCloy's body was found. Why are you telling me all this? 'cause I think Steve Garry came here to this apartment. He was here, wasn't he? Yes. He was here. Why did you let him stay here? You knew he was wanted. Yes I know, he told me why. And you were willing to jeopardize yourself for a... ...cheap gambler? - He's not that. - Dolores told me all about him. He's a different man now, I know, I'm sure of it. How? Because for the first time in his life he's stuck to a decent business. What was it? Marking cards or... ...loading dices? You're all wrong, he's giving up gambling. He and a man named Phil Gould, ...went in a boat business together in San Francisco. And he saved his money, he showed me his bank book. Six hundred dollars deposited every month. - And you believe that? - Yes, I do. So you let him stay here. No, he's gone now. And I supose you don't know where. No, I don't. And if you think he's hiding here, you're welcome to search. I already did while I was waiting for you to come back. Chain smoker, isn't he? I don't supouse you can arrest him for that. No. Not for that. Hello? I'm sorry, you have the wrong number. Perhaps it wouldn't have been a wrong number if I left a little sooner. I have no idea of what you're talking about. You're a mighty fine girl, Virginia. A kind of a girl most men wait a long time for. I'm as sure of that as I'm sure you mixed up with the wrong guy. Because of him, you probably have some sense of... ...false loyalty. And that's the reason you're telling me only half the truth. I have enough on you to take you in right now. I could hold you as a necessary or a material witness. Or for harboring a suspected killer. But I know you're not a criminal. You're just a decent girl who has got mixed up. I'll be back tomorrow to hear the other half of the truth. You better sleep on that. They got an old picture of me in here... ...back on the Barnes case. Yeah, that's a pretty nice looking picture. I better get you some blocks for Christmas. What that's supposed to be, anyway? A high pedestal. Oh, yeah, yeah. Only... Whose is supposed to be, for me? No. A fellow I've never met. But I figure anybody that noble, ...should be up on one. Steve Garry, eh? Yes, uncle Lou, Steve Garry. All right, there're.. ...two kinds of men I don't trust. One, habitual drunks. Two, habitual gamblers. Like our friend Steve Garry. But Virginia trusts him. I put the heat on her but it didn't do any good. (La presion?) I have a hunch she's protecting a full-grown rat. But I couldn't prove it. How much heat did you put on her? All there was, the bottle, the bus driver, ...and Dolores. She thinks he's reformed himself into the all-american boy. Putting his salary in a bank every month. And hiding out to help his friend. Too bad. But she's a swell looking girl. Why brought that up? Nothing. Only for my eyes you seem more worried about her than Garry You're off the beam, Lou, and you know it. And I had an uncle that reminds me of you. He was a doctor, pretty good doctor, ...his only trouble was he once fell for one of his pacients. He spent so much time curing her, ...it nearly lost him his practice. You better go home and get some rest, Lou. You're talking in your sleep. No, the story had a happy ending, my uncle recovered. - He married, eh? - No. She ran off with another guy. Let's get back to Steve Garry. All right, I'm back. There may be a way of knocking this guy... ...off his pedestal. I wanna find out if he won his bank account, ...or earned it. - Okay. That's on the teletype of San Francisco. Find out what they've got in the Gould file. I wanna set a teletype to the Chief of Police, ...San Francisco. Yeah? Virginia. I wasn't expecting you tonight. Who was with you when I phoned? Donovan. I thought it might be. - Were you followed? - I don't think so. Steve, they know who you are. Who told them, you? Would I've come here if I did? I'm sorry, Virgina, I... I'm sitting alone in this room. Listening to those waves. I'm getting edgy. Donovan knows so much already. Don't you see? I can't go on hiding behind lies. There's only one thing left to do. - You mean give up? - Yes, Steve. Going together now, tonight. And put an end to all this running and hiding and liying. And an end to Phil Gould too, eh? I've tried to help you for his sake as long as it was possible. It isn't any more. All right, Virginia. Can't let you go back alone. We'll do what you want. You'll see. It has to come out right this way. Donovan isn't against us. We did the best we could. The important thing now... ...is to stay together. Isn't it? Yes, that's the most important thing. We'd better get started. The car is down the road. Might just as well move a bed here and save rent. We never run out of reasons till we sleep. Brecker, Homicide. Yeah, he's right here. San Francisco. Right. Yeah. What? Yeah, that's on the nose. Yeah. Yeah. The quiz we've sent on that Garry started a landslide. I'm starting my indigestion. Hold on to you seat, Lou. We struck paydirt. Six hundred? By check. Okay. Will do. Garry didn't make any money on the boat business... ...because there wasn't any business. What do you know? Garry is a liar. And that isn't all, he just become the number one suspect... ...for the murder of Mrs. Gould. The D.A. knew she was being... ...blackmailed, but didn't know by whom. Her canceled checks showed she cash one for six hundred the first of every month. So our teletype told them where it went. A liar, a blackmailer and probably a murderer. Those're the same amounts Garry put into his bank. Well... This knocks the bottom out of the Gould case. Garry was ducking the witness stand to save his own neck. And, if Gould got exonerated, ...Garry can keep on running. Maybe you've got two killings for the price of one. Well, I hope one of them will make Virginia talk. Wasn't that the road back to Los Angeles, Steve? Yes, I guess it was. But I was thinking about Phil. Virginia, we can't throw away everything we've done... ...and turn back now. A man's life it's the most important thing he's got. All right, Steve. I know where we'll be safe. There's a friend of mine named Cap Douglas, down in San Diego. He sold me the charter boat, he owns me a favor too. We can make it in a couple of hours. But first, we'll need some gas. What'll be, folks? - Fill it up. - All right. Stay in the car. We can't take any chances. That'll be 3.93. Sorry, mister, I can't change a twenty, ...I'll have to go across the road and break it in the diner. Never mind, I have a credit card. Phone Donovan L.A. Police. Garry escaping. I'll look in the bedroom. Hey, something's leaking. Your girlfriend needs a new roof. She's gone. Ed. Yeah. It was the plug of the bullet hole. This is the other half of the story, eh? That's the story I never wanted to hear. Donovan. Get me Grant. The car's gone. Grant? Get this. A blue Ford 49 convertible. License number California 218, ...X 3382. What's that? A call just came in from an all-night station on highway 101. Virginia wrote a note to contact me. Car heading south. Right. - Got a half hour head-start on us. - May be difficult to pick them up at this time. Faster, Lou, what's the matter? You're afraid of getting a ticket? There's a law against hedgehopping. Do you think Garry will be crazy enough to try for the border? Wouldn't be so crazy if he tried it by water. Ah, it could be. He knows about boats. Frank's having the local boys put up roadblocks near the harbours. Just in case. - Yeah, that's too bad. That will spoil some of their poker games. That's the end of the road for us. We can't go any further by car. Steve, don't you see it's hopeless? We can make to the Cap Douglas's from here. Hold on! Come on, honey, let's get going. Get out of the car. Get out of the car! How long you've been waiting for this chance? It's no more than half a mile from here. Let's see how fast you can walk. Cap! Don't try anything, I'm warning you. Cap! Cap, wake up! What in blazes is...? Oh, Garry, where'd you come from? I'll tell you all about that later. Right now what my wife and I want is a boat. Hi. Got some for us? Yeah. Come on in and I'll see what I can do for you. Come on. You and the lady kind of caught me unexpected. You should've telephoned, Steve. Rest yourselves there. Well, let's see. I need a power cruiser like the Albatros. Yeah? It's not what you need, it's... ...what I've got. Why don't you make yourselves comfortable, you and the missus. Sit down, Virginia. Now, let's see... There's a fishing party coming in Saturday. You'll be back by then? - Yeah. Do you start right away? Yeah, I don't know why not. I'll have to get some gas into her. After we get some coffe into ourselves. Cap, look, forget the coffee, eh? All right. Don't give him the boat, he's running from the police! Shut up! All right. Take me to the boat. You won't get far without gas. Where is the gas? Oh, it's... It's out here. Behind a shed. Let's get it! Police! Aaaaah! Help! Help! You hear that? Let's go! Police! Get me the police! Down at the shipyard. That way. - Hi, sergeant. - Howdy. - Have they got them yet? - Not yet. They're back in that building somewhere. Can't get near on account of the girl. I hope they don't hurt that girl, she's the one who warned Cap Douglas. Otherwise he would've given Garry the boat. Using her as a shield right til the end. Come on, let's go. Better keep undercover. He's already used his gun. Keep the boys from getting trigger-happy, I don't want anything to happen to that girl. You two cover each end the building. Come out, Garry, you haven't a chance! Bring up that spotlight! Light on that wall. Come on! - Stand here back of the cables. - Uh-huh. I wanna try to separate them. Give me a chance to get around behind them, ...and throw a couple of wild shots to attract his attention. - All right. - Get the rest of the boys! I can't go any further, I can't! Stand on your feet. Stop that acting! Did you hear me? All right, on your feet. On your feet! Garry! Here, give me a hand. - Take her to the car. - Where's Garry? Hey, Ed! Oh, any luck? Well, we managed to separate Garry from the girl. She's safe in the car. - Good. Now we can close in. We blocked off every escape. Garry hasn't a chance of getting out of the yard. Come on! All right, Donovan. Don't move. There he is. Out there on the arm. Wait a minute. Where is Donovan? Hey, Donovan! Hey, Donovan! Put down that gun, Steve. I'm not gonna shoot you. They will. They'll think you're me. Don't yell. Hey, Donovan! Come on. Give us some cover, will you? He's trying to cross over to the other crane to make a getaway. Some way, he'll get over the other pier. I'm just telling your friend here how far Garry fell off his pedestal. Think you can take care of this prisioner? - I'll try. - Hope in. - So long, Jim. - Come on, boys.
