HIT THE ROAD Written and directed by Panah Panahi Where are we? We're dead! Give it to me. Right now! Give you what, dear mother? - Give it to her, punk. - What? - The cell. - I don't get it. - That's enough. - The cell phone. Give you what? I don't get you. - The cell. Is he deaf? - Shush! - I didn't bring the cell. - Shush! Little piece of shit. Didn't I command you not to bring it? - You commanded? - Sure, I did. Search him. Where did you hide it? Don't move. Who commanded what? Why are you searching me? I must know! Who commanded what? I need to know! Open the door, kick him out. He's lying, I can't stand it. Get out! Let's take off your pants. - No, not my pants! - Search his pants. Ok, I'll give it to you. Hurry up. You can have it. Was it really worth it? Abandoning your child! Little piece of shit. You hid it there? Warm and dry! What are you up to? - Why are you taking it out? - Keep him still! Sit down. Why? Why? Scissors? She cut it! Calm down! It's the SIM card, not your willy. Why shout and wriggle? Can't stand him. What to do with it? Should I swallow it? Maybe he should... These two... Where are you taking it? We'll pick it up on our way back. If anything happens to my phone... Shut up. Just remember where she hid it. Mom has disappeared. Stay or I'll gobble you up. It's really expensive! Let me be! Let me be! Let me be. Don't destroy the borrowed car. Mind your own business. Asshole! If I don't answer my calls, many people will worry. I have serious matters to take care of. Who worries about you, little fart? Everybody, hundreds of people. People you don't know. It's really annoying. Who are these friends who worry about you? Who worries about you more than your father more than your mother, your sister, your uncle or even your cousin's sister-in-law? The brother-in-law of the wife of your paternal uncle... Who worries about you? You don't know everything. Enlighten me. Madam Fakhrayi, she's the worrying type. She's 40. Not a bit old for you? Not the mother, the daughter. The chubby bear, what was her name again? She's no bear, she's a gazelle. If she's a gazelle it's damn serious. It's very serious. We worked out all the details. We're getting married. Don't you deserve better than Little Miss Four-Eyes? Plus, her father's gonna kick your ass. He wouldn't dare! You wouldn't let him! You have a broken-legged dad, and a fuck-up brother... Right. I'll kick him myself. And all of you if my phone is damaged. Wait! You can't go there. Let's go. - Let go of me. - Let's go. Get in the car. I don't want to, I'm too anxious. - Let me go. - Don't move! OK, breathe. You'll remember the place? Sure, I covered it with a stone. How will we find the cell if, God forbid, something happens to you? Thank you, God, for this scenery. Idiot! Stop kissing the ground! Sorry... You have dust all over you. - Looks like pistachios! - Dear boy! - Beautiful! - And there, a cake. And there, like frogs. A pair of frogs. And there, a lion's head. Or the Sphinx with riddles. Stunning! - Which one? - Over there. - Where? - There. Careful! Belt! Rear mirror! Side mirror! Handbrake! Clutch! Gear! Blinker! Onwards! I feel sad and depressed. If Miss Fakhrayi calls and I don't answer, she'll break up with me. Who's gonna be accountable? Are you blind? You should have changed your glasses "in extremis"? No one answers me? What is "in extremis"? Mister, would you be accountable? Would you, dear lady? Or you, Mister Shithead? Calm down sweetheart! These two grown-ups listened without protesting. No cell phones! Dad, Jessy seems tired. This is the Urmia lake. Well, it was. Once. Years ago, we would swim in it. Nowadays, you can only have a dust bath. Even better! We don't get wet. Here you are. Done. Good, good! Well done! Thank you. Let me see... What the hell! Can't be cleaned. Do you know how much it costs? Not much, I know the prices. First your brother and now you. You're ruining me. Let go of me. He destroyed the car. We can clean it later. We're being followed. What did you say? We're being followed. Got it! Why are you staring at me then? I thought you were not done talking. We're being followed. Cool, we're being followed. Act normal. Is he alone? Turn around and see for yourself. I'm telling you to act normal, and you tell me to turn and look? Jessy! Go hide. The bad guys are here. Park next to that car. Over there, with the others. Act casually. - Give me a tissue. - It's the engine coolant! Ignore him. It's gas! There must be a leak. It's the coolant! I was signaling you. Your tank is leaking gas. Get up! Pass the antenna. Ok, ok. Thanks! Thanks, go ahead. Take Jessy for a pee. Get out! Where is he going? Wait, come here! Take Jessy for a pee. Take him yourself. No, you have to do it. I'm busy. Wait a second. It's the coolant! Take him to pee. Behind the tree. This way. Come Jessy. He's right. There is a leak under the car. Dad, take him. Take him dad! Give him to me. It's the coolant! Don't look there! It's gas. Thanks a lot. Let me talk... What do you want, kid? Mister, could you come closer? You come closer! Don't break anything. Sorry, Rahman. Do you have a first-class second-hand cell? What! Bullshit! Get out, kid. Rahman, give me all your surplus in gas. I've got the clients. - I'll take care of it. Fast and easy! - How much for these? No worries. Not a gas leak but the coolant. Get away from the road! I told you it's the coolant. - When? - You weren't listening. Belt! Little fart. Rear mirror! Blinker! Told you Told you that being angry is a sin My eyes are on the road you took I'm begging you I can die for you but please don't play hard to get With your black eyes don't play hard to get Life is short Like a dream This too shall pass Make peace Spring will blossom again And will drown us in flowers Told you, told you, Being angry is a sin... Damn it! I'm not a kid anymore. Changing things "in extremis"? Shut up! Not in front of the kid! I'm feeling fine. - But you undermine me with these stupidities. - What's he talking about? Whenever people say "in extremis" something bad happens. Nonsense. "In extremis" is not a bad word. Don't you worry. Is bro going somewhere? He's gonna get married. Who would marry him? Lots of morons around. We wanna elope. Don't! You'll get caught. No bad omens, please! I have a bad feeling... He'll be back soon. Oh my God! Look, the cyclists. Oh yes. Great! Hello there. Athletes, heroes, celebrities. Oh, he fell. What happened? Don't stop. Go. Mister, are you ok? I'm sure he's fine. Mister, did you die? Are you dead? Get going. He's crying! If he's crying, he's fine. Where are you going? Monkey face! Stay in the car! See if the car is scratched. Take this and stop crying. I'm not crying, my leg hurts. I was in the middle of a race. Can you drop me at the infirmary? Wipe your tears, first. I'm not crying. Don't tease him. Leave him alone. Is it a national competition? Where are the caretakers, that follow you on bikes? It's not an official competition. We're practicing for the Grand National. But we've set up a prize for the winner. Could you move a little? - How much is the prize? - We put in 60,000 each. - How many are you? - 30. This makes for a prize of 180 million? 18 million. 1 million and 800, you geniuses! You might say goodbye to cycling now. Nonsense! Armstrong stayed the world champion with cancer. He's my role model in life and in sport. His name says it all: Arm. Strong. If only I could see him up close and kiss his hands, his legs... He was into doping, though. It's a known fact. They took back all his medals and threw him out like trash. From where? The Cycling Federation I guess. He was dismissed as a dishonest prick and it was aired on TV. Fake news! No, listen to me... He confessed in front of the cameras. That he cheated. With his tail between his legs. And gave back his medals. Fine, he cheated. He was a champion for ten years but didn't he become rich? Didn't he get a wife? So one can't get a wife without medals? I guess I was a Tour de France champion and I didn't know... Listen man, don't play devil's advocate, and live an honest life. Bravo, that's my man! Now a prayer for the father. Peace be upon Mohammad and his Holy Family. Please, have this cucumber. Don't! He gets sick. Have some pistachios. - What are you doing? - I want to give him something. What a zoo! Give him all we have! I should have won the competition. An athlete has to concentrate on sport, not on cheating or on doping. Sorry, the pistachios fell on the ground. - It's ok, leave it. - Move your foot! Look! Your friends! It's dirty. Leave it. One should not cheat! She's right, it's dirty, leave it. Haven't you ever cheated in your life? Done anything illegal? Then found an excuse? Well, lately I decided for my elder son... Shush. We all have a block for our transgressions. Our mind just stops all self-reflection. Why? Because we're sure we're good people. And it's true. We are good people, but we protect ourselves, and a filter helps us to forget. Pushing it all into the unconscious. The unconscious doesn't always talk... I can't express myself well enough in Farsi. I'd be more comfortable in Azari. Leave it, it's dirty. It's the birds share. What do you want? - Can I drink from your thermos? - You're killing me. An athlete who talks about serious matters is a rare specimen. Thank you, well, I myself... You memorized it, right? I was saying, I have a BA in sociology. Shit! Why did you give him this? He might have an infection or something. Swear to God, I don't have any sickness. Here you are. I'll fill it up with Red Bull. I'll get off here. Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Driver. Why are you giving him that? There is no infirmary here! There we are. My house is nearby. - I don't see any house around here. - Thank you. - Take your bike. - Thanks for everything. Be strong. - Thanks. - See you. Why don't you close that? You could have done it. Take Jessy for a pee. Why don't you take him? Your dog is really cute. - You want him? - No thanks. He has a serious infection and he's dying. And this stupid dad picked him up in the street. Our son is quite sensitive, and now he might see him die. Well, you should have put him down by the vet, poor thing. He was supposed to do that, but the dog was at our door again. We'll keep the kid busy, you take Jessy and leave him somewhere. Even if I was willing, and I'm not, what would you tell your son if I did that? That you stole him! - Seriously? No! - I'm going. Thank you all. Thank you, too. Thanks, bye. We hit him and he thanks us. He's a good man. Couldn't you shut up in front of the kid? I lost it for a moment. Sorry. No pee-pee yet? I can't look at Jessy. I feel bad for him. Weren't you supposed to take him to the vet? And put him down? With this broken leg? I sent Ahmadian. You told me a detailed story: while putting him down, the whole place got covered with shit and urine. The nurse cried her heart out. Ahmadian's story! Not my vocabulary! You said that you saw Jessy die with your own eyes. What is he doing over there? I'll take care of it. Step on it! No daydreaming! Let them spend some time together. Pee together... We won't stop again. Any wild beasts around? Go get them. The only two wild beasts here, are these two. No worries. Plus, what can I do with this leg? You piss me off with this leg. What can I do? Khosro. I'm losing it. What next? Is the guy reliable? I told you a hundred times. Houshang is a stand-up guy. We lost our house and my car too. For him to be able to leave. All I have is you and the little mouse. Do you ever think about the future? The future? I'm already drowning in it! What do you mean? Once out of the country, he'll work hard. He'll buy a house and we'll be reunited. Him, seriously? Stop it! That's enough! Ok, but him? Every morning, with my camera, I immortalized your artistic pee. I found it last night and brought it as a souvenir. It's quite a collection. Abroad, this would be a huge success in an art gallery. I have no doubt. And they would call it, "My Son's Creations: The Pees of Farid". Or: "Which country's map is this?" We are two brothers Smarter than the others We pee every night And we spray it just right We pee in a bottle We pee on Asia We pee on Africa We pee on Europe, if we get there To the health of my bro and me! Father! Dad, come here. Let me tie him up. I can't hold it anymore. Coming. What's that on your head? Is that Mom's scarf? She'll get upset... Explain it to me please? Leave me alone, I have a toothache. Once there, try to smoke less. You smoke too much. Not much. You smoke too much while watching movies. Don't watch movies. Fine, I won't. What's the world's best movie, for you? The world's best movie? Whatever... What kind of question is that? For once, give me a straight answer. And don't jerk me around. A Space Odyssey. Is it beautiful? Mesmerizing! You know... it's very zen. Calms you down. Takes you deep into the galaxies. Always wars in the galaxies! How can it calm you down? - Not always! - I don't get you men. There is no war in it. Thank God. We pray to God the Almighty The Milky Way Galaxy! The Milky Way Galaxy? What happens at the end? At the end, the hero is alone, in a spaceship. And he goes deep into a black hole. He goes deeper and deeper. That's all you see for half an hour. Crossing the limits of time and space. Don't go! Don't go! Son, don't go! Dad! Father! Papa! Damn it! What? Which song? Any damn song. Thank you for encouraging me. Most welcome. Do what you have to do. It will be highly appreciated. Sir, are you in the queue? Hello, Houshang! It's me, Khosro. What's up? No, still on the road. The deed for the house? Hold on! It's out of my hands. My problem, not yours. I'll take care of the deed later. I'm the fucking boss of the Middle East. The fucking boss. Not done yet? Haven't even begun! I was just singing. You heard him, hasn't begun, yet. I wasn't queuing for a concert! Talk to you later, on this number. Bye, Houshang. Don't talk! Just sing. And take your time. Good boy. You are my everything Without you I can't breathe I can't live without you Mister! Light? You're my everything Without you I can't breathe With you I have everything, Everything And no other needs Is he dead? What the hell? - Just cutting a lock of hair. - Why don't you leave me alone? You lunatics. Go back home. Home? You're the lunatic. Unbelievable! Shit-face! Let's go. - Where to? - To the shit-hole! Jessy, what are you up to? Are you ok? Why run like that? It's not good for you. Are you listening? Makes you die sooner. Then what to say to the boy? God, that idiot husband of mine... He was supposed to put you down. I'm not even sure about his leg. Four months in a cast? There he is. I want to hold Jessy. Stay inside or I'll kick your butt. I'm not in the mood. - She's not in the mood. - Give him to me. You leashed him to a disposable chair? A plastic chair. There was a pile of those. - Disposable... - Plastic! You're busting my chops! Take him. Jessy salutes you! Hello Jessy, how are you dear? Why did you ruin my hair? Was just a lock of hair, not your willy. - Jessy is asking about your health. - I'm fine. - Seat belt! - I didn't even remove it. - Rear mirror. - Didn't touch it. Don't talk back to your stupid dad! Wait! Hello. How are you? Where the hell are you? Come and choose one for God sake! Unbelievable! Hello sir, what happened to you? Are you ill? I fell. From where? From grace. Your leg is hurt too? Are you a doctor? I fell... They told us to buy a sheepskin. Would be nice to know where the hell to go. Do you have a traveller? Yes! Did you choose the sheepskin? They aren't dry yet? The last person chose for you and you will choose for the next. It's a tradition. It's a good cover! I choose that one. Which one? That white one. White is no good for hiding. The next person will get into trouble. I want that one. Are you sure? Yes. I'm not choosing a wife. I said what had to be said. Where the hell are you? We've been waiting for ages... Give him the signal. Step on it. Wasting our time... Why is he taking so long? Make the signal with your damn cap. How should I know? Whirl it around, let him see you. Yes, that's the way! Faster. You're making them sweat. You're asking me? Do it with your red panties! Let's see if this works. I'm not seeing him. Mister! Fine, he's coming. He's here! He's here! Good God! Who's this? Who's the traveller? Sheepskin? Why are you so late? Don't bust my chops. I almost fell. You old fart, go sell your sheepskin. What's it to you? - No cellphone, right? - No, swear to God. Take this road and come straight to the Hassan Ali Kandi junction. I'll be waiting for you in the village. Why don't you show some respect? Go to hell. Mister! Junction... Get lost! Daddy! Dad! What was all that about? Wasn't he Batman's enemy, the Scarecrow? Remember in the movie, he arrives in a cloud of fear gas and people see spiders everywhere. Shut up. I don't get it. Charging the full price for just the skin? Hasn't he already milked us enough? Plus paying for a whole sheep! They're pushing it! I know his kind! - Is it here? - To the right. Couldn't you ask right or left, when he was giving direction? Why didn't you? It didn't need a leg! Just an open mouth. I wasn't close, he couldn't hear me. Yes, right there. Just admit you didn't think of it. What is my bro up to? I'm bored. Bizarre! He must have suspected that we planned to eat him. You really wanna eat him? Yes. Last night's decision. Was I sleeping? Probably. But I think his meat is bitter. His ears are great for a kebab grill. Especially a grill on a hill. His meat is sweet and yummy. Even the baby cockroach is the apple of his mum's eye. Don't let him fool you. He's just teasing you. Mum I wasn't fooled. Right! I was fooled! Dad, are we cockroaches? We are now! - Here, right? - Yes, yes. Give me a hug. We're going to eat you tonight! I'm not a child anymore! Cool! Call your monkey brother. Bro! Come back! Where were you Monkey The First? Where were you? I went to the right side but it's a U-turn. - Are you sure? - Yes. - What is this? - It's Hassan Ali Kandi's sign. Why did you take it? It was already on the ground. I was looking for directions. - Did you find the way? - No. Why are you happy, then? Wait, Mister. Do I look happy? Mister! Stop! Wait. Thanks. Hello, how are you? Do you know where the "Kandi" village is? You won't find it on your own, follow me. We don't want to bother you. He says we can follow him. Get off. I'm staying. Sorry. No problem, let him be. Follow me, it's on my way. Thanks a lot. Sure, good riddance. Sorry, he is trouble. Sorry ma'am. Just warn them that he's an idiot! What a relief, what calm! Now I can sleep. Wow! Good God! What are we doing? I was suffocating, because of the kid. We should have told him. What an education we're giving him. All lies! Nothing but lies. He would have exposed us a hundred times... I pity the people on the bus, he is probably driving them crazy. Well, what are you going to tell him? Nothing. That you're married and have to run away and join your bride. And you'll be back soon. Anyhow, he's a lively kid. He won't be sad for long. What about you guys? Are you gonna stay sad for long? Of course not. It's going to be fine. It's going to be fine. We'll laugh at this one day. Seriously? What is there to laugh about? I begged you not to talk about separation and not to cry, during this trip. It breaks my heart to see you like this. Let me go reassured, knowing that you'll be fine. I cried because of a sad memory. Nothing to do with you leaving. Why would I mess up your mood? Nonsense. Don't tailgate the minibus. It's suffocating us. Your husband told me to stay close not to lose him. Now, her husband tells you not to tailgate the damned minibus. You're such an ass. That little devil is so cute. Hello, villagers! Can't you shut up? Why are you hitting me? - I didn't. - What did I do? It was a joke. I don't appreciate your jokes. - Hello, you have a traveller? - Yes... - Please... - What? Please go behind the coffee shop. Remember who you're looking for, Hassan-Ali The Third. Hassan-Ali The Third. Well! What are you waiting for? Go ahead! Get going. Where is bro going? I go with him. Look at this cute calf. He looks exactly like you. He's really cute. - Do you want to make friends? - Yes. Do we look suspicious? No, you worry too much. I am worried... What could happen to him? Left, left. We did our research. Houshang is a stand-up guy. Why did you let him go alone? Go with him. At his age I started a family. Now you worry that he's by himself? Ok, I'll go, I'll go. Don't try to be funny. No fingers in his eyes! Halt! - God damn it! I'll kick your ass! - Why are you here? They all saw you. So what? Your lovely mother ordered me to join you. He asked us to wait here. - The hell with him. - What? I don't like the guy. You know where to go? What? Were you always like this? Like what exactly? Where to go? Okay, okay! God damn it! Another 2 km and then wait at the end of the road. After an hour they'll come to pick us up. - Where are you going? - Come. Didn't they say when you'll hit the road? They said... First we're put in "quarantine". Then, when the time comes we'll meet again to say goodbye. It might take another 2 to 3 days. You should go back home. Shut up. Don't you know your mother? Leave you here? She won't let go until you get to the border. If they don't see me they leave without me. They wouldn't dare. Didn't they say in an hour? Come, sit here. Relax! I'm stressed. Stressed! Stressed! Stressed. Bring me that apple. The other one too. Wash them. Whenever you kill a cockroach, don't throw him in the toilet. His parents sent him abroad, with lots of hope. I see... And don't whine in front of your mom. She'll be heartbroken. I know! That's why I was careful. You were careful? How many times did I catch you? I'll be more careful. One doesn't cry in front of one's mother. But in front of one's father... You expect me to cry in front of you? No. But I give you permission if you'd like to. Kind of you. Thanks. If you wanna know your friend, ask him to share an apple with you! And see if he gives you the bigger half. Monkey face, let me finish my sentence. There... Don't you see? You took the bigger half. Are you blind? Give it to me. Ok, ok. Which half should I take for our friendship to last? Too late. Forget it. It tastes like eggs. We have to go dad. Eat it. You'll be less stressed. Don't be afraid of anything. Those who leave on a boat should be afraid. Not you. Houshang is waiting for you on the other side. No fear! Don't be scared. Ever. I'm worried about your house that you put up for my bail. What about me? Your crazy brother? Or your poor mom? Don't we matter? Sure you do, I... Don't talk with your mouth full. I have been saying this for 2 decades. Ok, ok. What was I saying? - That you worry about the house. - Right. I'm worried about it. So? Why do you always repeat yourself? I asked you what about us? Me, your crazy brother, your mom? And what was my answer? Are you serious or are you pulling my leg? Me, making fun of you? Why would you think that? Ok, I'm reassured. Mom is not here, drop the act! You don't believe that my tooth hurts? Let me see it. Which one? - It's really in bad shape. - I told you. Please go to the dentist once you're in Tehran. And stop venting to mom. It's been a long time since we last talked like this. Thanks for your support. Shut up. Done deal. Great, tied to a tree, time for a yummy barbecue out of Monkey the 2nd. What did he say? Who's the traveller? Nothing, he's asking for direction. He's lost. Cool, kebab time! Good day, sir! We don't have a cell phone and we've been discrete on the road. I asked you to be discrete. I insisted that he come alone. His dad was worried. He kept his distance. No bad intentions. Your address sucked. You didn't say which side to take at the crossroad. And we had to buy the whole sheep. Ok, let's go. Right now? Khosro! I'll take him to quarantine. You can say goodbye in two days. You should have told us before. Wait. Dad, untie me. I'm coming. Let me see if I can hunt you from afar. Here you are: the sheepskin and his bag. This bag is too big, it's going to expose us. - I'll change it. - Don't make a fuss. Ok, I'll change it. They take him to quarantine, and bring him back in a few days, to say goodbye. Mom! Shut up! Come and free me. Mom, come and untie me. Untie me. Mom, untie me. Help! Why can't he shut up? He's annoying. I'm thirsty, I'm hungry. Take this money and provide a correct address. Don't confuse us this time. I'll tell you where to camp. I'm thirsty. Gosh, I forgot something. What is it? A hat and a shawl. Listen, don't worry. Go now and come back to say goodbye. Ok? Hurry up, we're late. Stop shouting! Untie me. Don't worry, Houshang is a stand-up guy. A real one! When are you coming back? Nothing, nothing. Bro! I'll keep him busy. Where is bro going? Wait, wait. Two minutes! My kid is going to catch cold. Take care. Ok, my boy? Wait, wait. Wrap it around you. Where are you taking my boy? Wait... Take the dog, I can't hold him anymore. Son, hold the tailgate. Come on, good dog. Bravo! Are you holding it? Hello. Hi, how are you? What a beautiful girl. What's your name? - Mobina. - Nice. Beautiful hair. Yes, very. You'll get tired like this. Press this and it gets blocked. Interesting. You have the same car? No, but I think they all have this. - Thank you so much. - Most welcome. - Can I help you? - No thanks. Mobina dear, can you show the kid around? - Yes, sure. - That's nice. - Can we take the dog too? - No, he's sick. Go ahead dear boy. My husband has one broken leg and two broken hands. - What's wrong with him? - He's weak. Don't you see? He was always like that. - So beautiful. - Yes. Is this the great bear? God what did you create? You're the Almighty. A starry night! How do you feed him? The little one gives him... Don't kiss the ground. Chips. I'll smash your head if you kiss the ground. Feed chips to a dog? - I'm sorry. I regret it. - Don't. It's sleeping time. He was like family. How many are you? 5 including the one that left. Don't lie on the ground. It's cold. - Dad? - Yes? Where is Farid? Farid! Farid leaped! He went off-roading. He comes back tomorrow, right? - God willing. - Turn it off. What is this? Ask him. - Mister, what is this? - Headlamp, dear. When is he coming? Be precise. Not tonight. Maybe tomorrow. And maybe the day after tomorrow. Mister, is it original? Nothing is original anymore. How much is it? Expensive. Maybe the day after tomorrow... What time? Mister, I can't move easily. When you leave, give the dog to my wife Sure. What time? Goodbye then. Nine thirty! Goodnight. Ten thirty... Eleven thirty, maybe... Where would he go after off-roading? Twelve thirty. After off-roading? After leaping? Oh dear! Look over there! Look at the sky! Look! Where is my bro? I have to tell you something. He went to get a beautiful wife. I asked him to bring a Batman mask, when he returns. An original one. Couldn't find it here. Will he meet Batman? Sure. If he's smart enough, he'll get an appointment. And if he's even smarter, he'll make it on a Sunday. Because Sunday is a holiday. But Superman doesn't help people! Not on Sundays, Mondays or Tuesdays... He's very lazy. He's a bum. He's not even a superhero! He's an ass. I have a question though. Would Batman give him his car for a ride? He's not crazy, you know. Give that expensive car to your blind brother? To crash it? Not in this life. He's not crazy. That car doesn't get destroyed, not even with a rocket. Cool wheels. It's a fabulous car with a fridge, a PlayStation and a fantastic sound system. And a sixth gear to fly. - Really? - Sure. So, that damn car must be quite expensive. You can't find it on the market but I did some math, and I found out the car's price. Bravo. How much was it in our currency? I don't know it in our money and I don't have my notebook. But I know the price in dollars. How much? 600 million dollars. 600 million dollars? Too much. If his expensive car gets scratched, the motherless Batman, will snap. He will sit in the middle of the road and shout: Oh God! You mean he'll be devastated? Yes and cry, cry and cry. People will ask him what has happened. He'll show them the scratch. And then, they'll start crying, too. He'll cry his heart out. And a blind man will pass by and ask: I hear lamenting, weeping and moaning. What is it all about? He'll ask him to come closer and touch the car. He touches the scratch... What did you say earlier? - Voo? - Wow! Wowwwww. And he'll start crying too, weeping and moaning. And Batman, in the middle of all that will shout "Oh, my car is", "scratched." "Oh my car is scratched, scratched." "Oh, my car is scratched."

This new girlfriend of yours is much prettier than Miss Fakhrayi. - Yep. - Go, play with her. Go, she's over there. Wow! I saw my love leaving me. And the color on my cheeks fading I'm caught in the stormy sea of love My love is leaving me on Noah's Ark What a mood I am in! I'm homesick in this foreign land God is all I have What a mood I am in I'm homesick In this foreign land God is all I have Who can hear the pain of my broken heart What can I sing with my tired voice I miss my homeland What can I do, my love is there What a mood I'm in! I'm homesick In this foreign land My dear! You are my love. I love you! Jessy, come here. Jessy! Dad! Check Jessy out! Jessy's not feeling well! Mom! Dad... Jessy's not feeling well! Jessy! My dear tribesman You are riding happily The horse of foreign lands Proudly In this country You the noble man You were the last one standing But you broke, too Thirsty and believing in thirst Pride was the name of our love What you gave away to the wind Was all we had Which autumn called you You the lost soul With its magic voice For you to leave us so bravely Stay with me as I'm waiting Sadly for spring Stay with me Together, we can bring back the sun again Thousands of birds In love like you Crossed the night in hope of daylight They were gone not to return Until dawn Not to return till this day God be with you Tired of darkness But leaving isn't The answer to the pain You took the road toward sunset And not toward sunrise It's getting dark, come back Pantea Panahiha Hassan Madjooni Rayan Sarlak Amin Simiar In a movie by: Panah Panahi HIT THE ROAD Director of photography: Amin Jafari Script consultant: Nader Saïvar With thanks to Kasra Forouhi Music: Peyman Yazdanian Based on Schubert's original song Editing: Ashkan Mehri, Amir Etminan Mix: Zohreh Ali Akbari Sound: Abdolreza Heydari Makeup artist: Iman Omidvari, Maryam Saligheh Set design: Babak Djadjaï Tabrizi Costumes: Mahsa et Sara Khamisi Color correction: Kamran Saharkhiz Special effects: Mohammad Sanifar First assistant director: Negar Joneydi Second assistant director: Saman Iran Nejad Stage manager: Nader Saïvar Production manager: Milad Mahdizadeh Producer: Mastaneh Mohajer Written and directed by Panah Panahi Translation: Toufan Garekani Subtitling TITRAFILM
