Don't cry, Bella. We live in a rented house here. But we don't need to pay rent if we live there, in our own house. Are you sad because you have to leave your friends behind? I'm sorry. But I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun there. Don't cry. Show Mommy your smile. Let's go. Come on. I've only just arrived in Yogyakarta. Beats me. I just got the news that I inherited my mom's house.

Come on in. How many bedrooms are there in this house? Three upstairs and two downstairs. Mom. Can I go upstairs? Just be careful. Don't ever open that door! But why? So? Do you like it here? No. I prefer our house in Jakarta. This house is scary. Scary? But I like this house better. You just haven't realized this house is much nicer than the one in Jakarta. But I like it better in Jakarta. Mom, let's go back to Jakarta. Bella. Forget the house in Jakarta. We live here now. How do you feel about returning here, Dewi? Ms Ratmi, who is that? There is no one there. Bella. What's wrong? There's no one there. Let's eat. Come on. Ratmi. How long have you lived here? A long time. Before my mom died? How about dad? Bella. You don't want to stay here because you haven't made any friends yet. You'll like it here once you've made some friends. Hey. I'll find you a nearby school tomorrow. So you can go to school right after the holidays. Bella. Smile for me. Don't be so cold to Mommy. Hey. Please look at me. Come, let's play. Bella? Bella. Darling. Bella. Bella. Bella.
