TILDA:... We are not leaving without taking advantage of these bad boys. Free breakfast at Buffalo Bills. Seriously, let's just cut our losses. Cut our losses? What part of this free breakfast buffet at Buffalo Bills sounds like a loss to you? [ELEVATOR MUSIC PLAYS] Let's get real, Lizzo. Bloody wake up! Dude, we're already cutting this vacation short because we don't have any money and every activity around this place involves spending money. We don't need to spend money to have a good time, Lizzo. You know that, right? [ITALIAN SOUNDING MUSIC PLAYS] KERRY [VO]: My girls. I'm as proud as a mother can be. Always got each others' backs. And backsides, in this case. Egging each other on since they were knee high to a grasshopper. But they haven't had the most conventional of upbringings. Now that there... is Baz Wentworth. Now, he and his wife Raelene... were something of Australian greyhound royalty. I mean, she bred flawless dogs. And he trained them into champions. BAZ: Ah... They can't be beat, these dogs. Every single race. We've got the winning formula. Winning formula or not, little did Raelene know that Baz was doing a dodgy and having a brief but passionate affair with me. See, I used to work as a bookie down at the track taking bets and Baz and I formed a bond fixing races. You know, doing some extra coin on the side. How could any woman resist a bloke like Baz? Anyway, Raelene and I got knocked up in quick succession and nine months later... Raelene had little Liz and I had my Matilda. I like to think of her as a love child rather than a bastard. Anyway, in the mid-nineties, Baz decided to expand his dog racing empire. See, he had formed some connections with the king did-a-ling of racing in the great United States. Land of opportunities, he said. That's when his business started to go pear shaped. He was shaking like a cockatoo in a cyclone. I think he'd gotten too mixed up with his American friends and gotten in a bit deep. Then suddenly, his mother-in-law Opal drops dead. Dead?! Well, it all looked very suspicious when... the autopsy showed she died of an overdose. Overdose?! And then a shipment linked to Baz and Raelene was seized full of heroin! Heroin?! The very same batch of heroin that caused Opal to kick the bucket. Well, they were both thrown in the slammer for drug trafficking and murder. Twenty-five to life. YOUNG TILDA: Liz, come play with me. But that's where I came in. Put my hand up to raise little Liz as me own with her half-sister. Now look at them. Thick as thieves. [HONKING AND JAZZY VEGAS SOUNDING MUSIC BEGINS] TILDA: Everything on that! LIZ: Oh, blimey. ROULETTE DEALER: Twenty-nine black. TILDA: D'oh! TILDA: [CONT] Oh, come on, mate! Don't be a dickhead!

LIZ: Mate, I really think we've done our dash here. TILDA: We just need to find a babe on a winning streak and get him to cough up some of his chips for us. TILDA: And then w-I could can make out with him and you can make out with his friends. TILDA: Rise. Rise up. This is Vegas, mate. LIZ: Oh, bugger it! It's Vegas!

Do you think it's really a good idea for us to go back to his hotel room? He's a babe and his friend is no doubt a babe also. Yeah. Wouldn't kill you to get some action, sweetheart.

It's turtle racing. Right-o. So it's kind of like greyhound racing, but boring as bat shit. Am I right? - Yeah. - Am I right, Jose? Do yourself a favor and get that shirt off.

Oh, we're just performing. Right, yeah. As officers of the law, ladies, though, we do have to ask whether you have a permit. - You need a permit. - Working... operating a business. They've got permits. They do? They got a permit? Yeah, they got one. Okay. Alright then. Well, uh- So... Yeah, we're gonna let that one slide. Not our jurisdiction. We actually end right down over down yonder, Yeah, so. We'll let the rest of the boys handle this area. You know, it's kind of a gray area anyway, but... Well, you guys, you know, you gotta, you gotta get one of these, just in case. Our personal contact, professional official deets. Check out the picture. That's us. That's us at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Nevada. Yeah. Anyway, if there's a fire or you need to be rescued then... Give us a call. Awesome. Great. Rescue this! - Ooh! - Okay!

She spits and all that ass! - Nasty ladies! - Spit on it! Spit on it! - Alright! - Damn, girl, I like it! Bye! Those d-bags can go fist themselves. Yeah. So what are you doing here? Oh, I'm a teacher's aide, so I like to come down and get inspiration for class. So, you work with kids? Yeah, I just love those little suckers. Hey, you want to hang out soon, yeah? What?! Oh, hi, Daddy. I gotta go. Hi. Bye. Bye. Dude. Eighty-one dollars in our first session. What! What! What! What! What! - We are rippers! - I know! We're never gonna have to tell mum. Hey, she's never gonna have to know. Yeah. I know. I'm really excited. I think, I think we should go celebrate. Yes! Okay, let's go get dinner. Yeah! But I don't think we should spend all the money, so. That we just made. We should probably just go back home. Come on. We don't want to get burnt out. Yeah, but we need to be responsible. No, live a little. Come on! Fire up, mate. Let's go get some dinner. To the juice bar. Okay. To the juice bar! And I've had to say to the customers on numerous, numerous occasions that I, I cannot and I will not ever serve the flesh of a once-living creature. One's- one's body is the, um... uh, temple in which the spirit lingers. And consuming an animal would only incite conflict between the spirits within our own bodily temple. And I, I'm not saying that, you know, plants themselves are... Do you mind if I grab the check? But the plant soul is opposed in harmony with the animal soul together. Fifty bucks?! Yeah. That's with your discount and it doesn't include the tip. The plant's soul is evolved and we must also never... [WHISTLE] I, I'll be with you in a minute, sir. We must never forget... I'm sorry. I just want to stop you there. When we asked about the specials and you recommended that bean thing, um, you knew that it was five times the price of absolutely everything else on the printed menu? You said you were celebrating. Yeah. Well, we didn't want to celebrate that much. How about some dessert for everybody? Dessert sounds, uh, marvelous. Today we have a, uh, a vegan carrot cake and a, a raw date and cacao brownie. It's fresh! It's really... - Bye, ladies. - Bye! Ah! He totally knew that it was us with the whole Supercolossal thing. How he kept saying marvelous all the time. At least we got a dinner out of it, you know? It's not like we completely blew our wad. And I mean we earned a hundred bucks almost in the first sitting. We got ages to go. We'll be alright. Don't worry about it. No, we have to earn four times the Potter amount every single day to break even and at the moment, school kids are our demographic. And they're only around like afternoons and weekends. LOCAL GIRL: Spare some money, please? Have a good one, mate. So, I guess it's just about scheduling. We have to maximize our time somehow, you know? Alright. Well, alright, then we spend all tomorrow down on the boardwalk doing like recon? Figure out who's down there, what time. Okay. And then we can pair the demographics age business. Yeah, that's a good idea. I mean, we'll lose a day, but I reckon in the long run it's better. Sweet. Okay. So at least we've got one profitable business that Michael helped us set up. Thank god for Nigel giving us these mad costumes, eh? As much as our predicament truly does suck balls, Lizzo, I am so glad it's you that I'm stuck with and not some blow-in. You are sensible. You have got a good head on your shoulders. Dude, you're my responsibility. In a good way. You know, like mum and dad they were just such crooks and I feel like... They are innocent, hey. Dude, they're as guilty as sin. But yo, you and mum are my real family now. And I feel like mum would be really proud of us if she saw what we were doing. Yeah, I mean after the initial ten years or so of disowning us, I reckon she'd be really proud of our teamwork in this situation. Do you think she would disown us? I would not put it past her. It's funny to think she's just on the other side of the ocean. Do you reckon when the sun sets here it's like, rising over there, over there? No, cause it's like only seven hours ahead, so. Oh yeah. No, you're right. That's a nice thought though. - Is it? - Yeah. [WATER AND WIND CRASHING] ♪ SOFT PIANO MUSIC ♪ UPBEAT LATIN MUSIC [DISTANT CROWD VOICES] Yup. Just as I suspected. Babes everywhere, Lizzo. Every hour. You can note that down. Mate, be careful with the binoculars. We've gotta give them back to Pits. His name is Nigel. Whatever, just don't bloody break them. I don't actually know why we need these anyway. Like I can see fine right here. And they're kind of giving away my creep game, to be honest. Nah. The beauty of this plan is that I can check out everything that's going on here and you can look further away so we cover more distance in less time. Not just a hatrack my friend. Oh, hello, sweetheart. Oh, mate, you dropped your wallet. [WHISTLES] Anyway, what you need to focus on is finding someone that you might like, right?

We are two exotic birds in a foreign land. Just waiting to get poached. Alright? By babes. And you are hindering that opportunity for both of us with this neg attitude. Let's just go over the observations that we've made so far and then we can come up with a contingency plan and we can see where the holes in our market are. Can you at least acknowledge my bird pun just now? So far, we've had hippies, hobos, tourists, obviously. We've seen a lot of dogs. Maybe we could do a dog wash or something. What about all these fit bastards though? What about them? What do they like? Getting more fit. Yes. Maybe we could do a fitness dance class. We could get Michael to help us with some moves. Michael. We get Michael involved, could we? Hey, you dropped something. Dude, you didn't actually drop anything. Hello, ladies. How's it all going? Yeah, good, thanks, Pits. I mean, Nigel. How are you? Oh, I was hoping to have a barbecue tonight. I just came to get some food. Oh, sweet. Of course you ladies are invited. You can invite some friends if you'd like. Great. Who else have you got coming? No one. Just sort of a whim, actually. Oh, well, maybe we could see if Maci and Michael want to come. If that's alright with you. Yeah. Sure. Friends of yours are friends of mine, Cuz.

[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BEGINS] The direct line to the cops. No wonder Liz was so out of control at the party. He must have drugged her to take the money. Steven Craig. Hm. Oh, hello. Officers? Hey, babe. You over twenty-one? Ha ha. I'm just kidding. This ain't my jurisdiction. Officer Cox. What's the four one one? Uh, i-i-it's a kidnapping and a theft. Hell, there's a drug bust too. Just get down to Truth's Juices as soon as you can and put the search out for two Australian women. He's not even vegetarian! Wait, Juan Carlos. This is the guy who Uncle Baz and Auntie Raelene were dealing with just before they went to prison. Dear Mr. Craig, Thank you for your services this year. May we dig holes together for many more opals in the future. Opals. Wait. Craig Cargo? These guys killed my granny. Seren-bloody-dipity. Not just a pretty face, is he? You see, since the nineties, Juan Carlos had been the head honcho of the American sports gambling world. So, when the Wentworth's threatened to bring in their champion greyhound - Juan Carlos stood to lose a lot. So, he decided to stop it. BAZ: Ah, fair suck of the old sav, Juan Carlos. Ya boofhead! So Juan Carlos chose to demonstrate how serious he was. He gave Truth, Steven Craig, a call to arrange a hit. See, Steven had been fired from a large pharmaceutical company. But he'd made the right connections to very quickly become something of a local drug lord. And being the drop kick that he is, he happily agreed... sending ultra-potent heroin disguised as blood pressure medication to Grandma Opal. Do not push me too far, Mr. Wentworth. Oh, Juan Carlos, you flaming mongrel. I will not back down. That was the biggest mistake of Baz's life. Juan Carlos decided to make him suffer... so he sent a shipment of heroin to the Wentworth's, tipped off the cops, and framed them as drug dealers and murderers. And that was curtains for the Wentworth empire. Of course, Juan Carlos saw an opportunity to make more money and decided he wanted Steven's drug operation to himself. So, he muscled in and closed it down. Well, Steven went into hiding then reemerged, having reinvented himself into a hemp-wearing yogi juice bar owner. A perfect drug front for a small-scale operation. Liz's parents are innocent. I'm gonna make him wish he never heard the name Michael Saxon. [BLENDER WHIRRING] Officers! Yeah, we got here pretty quick, huh? Yeah, you guys said something about a drug bu- Ho! Holy! God! That is a lot of cocaine. Alright, well, we better take some pictures of this before, uh, before it all disappears, huh? ♪ IT'S, IT'S, IT'S, IT'S MY PARTY, PARTY, PARTY ♪ Okay, girls, so I-I'm kinda guessing you're gonna want to go into hiding. Guessing? I thought you had the whole thing figured out for us. I did. It's done. Come on. Come on. Ah, come on, come on, Ladies, don't look so shaken, alright? I'm gonna fix you some nice relaxation juices. Wait a minute. Someone's been in here. Hm. Amateurs. Put your hands in the air, sir! Ho, ho, whoa, man. You don't have anything on me. Oh, really? We got nothing on you, huh? What about this? - Uh... - Show him-show him... Show him the drugs. Pull out the drugs. Boo-yah! So you think you could take me? Yeah? Shit, was that you? Asshole! That was ours! Goddamn! Shamona! - Shit! - Wait, wait, wait! Cuffs! Cuffs! Okay, go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Cuff him. Put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye! Liz. Girls. Are you safe? Yeah. What is this, a drug bust? - Yes ma'am. Indeedy-deedy. - Yeah. It's a bust. Yeah. Wait. Is this the shit you've been putting in our drinks the whole time? Come on. The Ritalin helped you work better, didn't it? I was just doing you a favor. What. Getting them to earn all that money with impressive efficiency... just so you could steal it from them? You! POLICE OPERATOR: All available units. Two bodies have been recovered from a trunk of a vehicle wreckage. Oh, hey. No, no, no, no, no. It was them. It was them. I saw them do it. They pushed the car off the cliff. I have video on my cell phone to prove it. Holy shit, you guys! I just got a call that my car fell off some cliff? What the hell...? Oh, hey! I haven't seen you guys today. How's it going? It's totally her... Oh! It's Maci! Hey! What's up? It was him. He threatened us with torture. Yeah. One finger at a time, he said. And a hanging. Yeah, a hanging. And we did not know there was people in the car. We had no idea. We really did not know that until just now. Juan Carlos was a tyrant and a parasite. Alright, it was my service to the country! Dude, you killed Juan Carlos? - You shot that man? - He was like the big boy. - You are incredible. - That is awesome, man. The-the same Juan Carlos who you killed Grandma Opal with? Yeah. I mean-Oh. Not exactly your first offense, is it? Tell us your real name, Truth. Tell us the truth, Steve. Dude, you are so very badly under arrest. Always wanted to say that. So, our parents are innocent. Suffer in your jocks, mate, you prized bloody asshole. Wait. Oh, hey, oh, come on! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Come on, wait, wait, man. So my car. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Hey, mum. Oh, Matilda. Oh, I'm so glad you called. Oh god, I've been feeling terrible. Hey, um, did you hear anything about Dad and Raelene getting released? I didn't know how to get a hold of you. Are you okay? So, we're not in trouble anymore? Oh, I can't stay angry at you. Anyway, it's just made me realize more than ever that family comes first having Baz and Raelene here. RAELENE: Hi, girls. We're out of the clink! Is that you, guys? Mum? Dad? Yeah! Yeah! And that bloody Juan Carlos and his mongrel crime mob they got blown apart by some deadset vigilante legends over there in the States! And how's your bus tour going, girls? Oh, it's going great. Thanks, mum. Um, but actually we're about to come home. We're bringing our boyfriends. - Oh, lovely. - Yeah! Yeah, you mean Liz has got a boyfriend too? I-I've thought she might have been a rug muncher. Whatever makes you happy, dear. Thanks, mum. See you soon. Love you. Love you. Bye bye. Hurry home, girls. We miss you. We miss you. Loves yas. [OVERLAPPING] Bye! Bye! Any casinos on the way to the airport? Don't want to stop in and roll the dice, do we? No? Right-o.
