How are you? ... You look beautiful... Thank You... Whole Peru speaks of your Work. I am proud of you. Thats Jack Wilder. What are you doing here? Guards! Leave and give me a sign, when they are back. Go ! Here is the head of Francisco Pizarro, who conquered Peru and gave the crown to the Castillian. Incredible! Unbelievable! Send two or three men up there! One,Two,Three, up there. The rest come with me! I hope i can fill up all jeeps with gold. You need much more jeeps for all that gold.
