Shh. Be very, very quiet. I'm hunting rabbits. [CHUCKLES] Oh, boy, rabbit tracks. Oh, Bugsy. Bugsy, pal, there's a friend here to see you. Survival of the fittest. And besides, it's fun. [LAUGHlNG] Did someone knock? [GUNSHOT] Eh, what's up, doc? Now l got you-- You rabbit. [CHUCKLES] Say, doc... ...are you trying to get yourself in trouble with the law? This ain't rabbit-hunting season. It's not? No, it's duck-hunting season. That, sir, is an unmitigated fabrication. It's rabbit season. -Duck season. -Rabbit season. -Rabbit season. -Duck season! Rabbit season. I say it's duck season, and I say, "Fire!" [SlGHS] Let's try that again. -Okay. -I'll start it this time. Right. Rabbit season. Duck season. Rabbit season! Rabbit season. Duck season. Fire! Okay. This time you start it. Whatever you say. -Rabbit. -Duck! Fire! What's the matter? Everything's upside down. Strange. Can't make heads or tails of things. Hey, you, come back here. [CLlCKlNG] Well, what do you know? No more bullets. [lMlTATING ELMER] No more bullets? Hey, laughing boy, no more bullets. No more bullets? Here, let me see that thing. Hmm. Well, what do you know? One bullet left. [lMlTATING ELMER] One bullet left? -Hey, laughing boy, there was-- -I know, I know! Hmm. Devilishly clever. Uh-oh. [AS BUGS] Eh, what's up, doc? Having any luck on those ducks? It's duck season, you know? [AS DAFFY] Just a darn minute. Where do you get that duck season stuff? Says so right over there on that sign. You're so smart. You know what to do with that gun, doc. You're despicable. Yes, you're despicable. [STAMMERS] And picable. And you're very definitely despicable. How a person could get so despicable in one lifetime is beyond me. It isn't as though I haven't met a lot of people. Goodness knows it isn't that. It isn't that, goodness knows. It isn't. [STAMMERS] Despicable. "Fillet of duck bordelaise ma√Ætre d' butter." Yum, yum. "Duck polonaise under glass." DAFFY: Mm, mm. "Rabbit au gratin de gelatin under tooled leather." Oh! Drool, drool. "Barbecued duck meat with broiled duck bill Milanese." Yummy-yum. "Chicken-fried rabbit with cottontail sauce, braised in carrots." Mm, mm. I'm sorry, fellas, but l'm a vegetarian. I just hunt for the sport of it. Ha, ha. Oh, yeah? Well, there's other sport besides hunting, you know? Anyone for tennis? Nice game. Now, you screwy rabbit, you're next. [GUNFlRE] All right, come out or l'll blast you out. For shame, doc. Hunting rabbits with an elephant gun. Elephant gun? That's right, doc. So why don't you go shoot yourself an elephant? You do, and l'll give you such a pinch! Ooh, just wait till l get that screwy rabbit and that screwball duck. [SNIFFING AND BARKING] [GROWLS] [GUNSHOT] Hey, what's the big idea? Why don't you look where you--? Huh? [lN FALSETTO VOICE] Oh, how simply dreadful. You poor little man. Did l hurt you with my naughty gun? Aw, shucks. Well, I, uh-- [ELMER CHUCKLES] [GROWLS] [SCREAMS] Gypsy, you naughty bow-wow. Stop that. Okay, rabbit, I see through that disguise. Say your prayers. You too, duck. Rabbit season! Duck season! -Rabbit season. -Duck season. -Rabbit season! -Duck season! Uh-oh. [GUNFlRE] [lMlTATING ELMER] Shh. Be very, very quiet. We're hunting Elmers. [CHUCKLES AS ELMER] [English - US - SDH]
