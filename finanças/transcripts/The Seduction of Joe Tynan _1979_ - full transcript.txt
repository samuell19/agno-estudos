Black men and women between 20 and 24 are trying to find jobs... to support themselves and their families. What are we here for gentlemen? 10 million people are not able to put food on their tables. Are we here for them? Now, I know this bill is not a cure all. According to the estimates made By the Congressional Budget Office... between 66,000 and 70,000 jobs... will be created for every billion dollars spent. So at best this will only create a million jobs. Only a million. But the question is, can we afford to subsidise that many jobs? Well, let me ask my distinguished colleague from Arizona. How many children can this nation afford to let go hungry? If we're not here for these children... for these families... what are we here for? Mr President I yield the floor. Do you realise I got the Works Bill passed? Do you know how many people have tried? And I got it passed. I think you must be a genius. Really darling. That must be it I've got clout. My little subcommittee has power. What? I don't have any covers. - No kidding? - What are you doing? It's called getting you attention. Oh, really? You can't get enough of me, right? - Well... - Power makes women crazy. It's certainly making you crazy. Do you realise that I got a bill passed today... and it's going to put a million people to work? You know how I did it? I said one word. Shazam? No. Subcommittee. - Oh my God. Don't say that word. - Why? It drives me... wild. Stop it. I'm gonna give you 6 seconds to do something wonderful to my body. After that I start playing rough. Ok? - 6, 4, 3... - Come here. 2... - How's that? That better? - Yes. Do you know there are dozens of men in their beds wishing they were me? Just wishing they had their names on that Public Works Bill. - That's it. - What? - That's it. - What? - No, no, no. - Come on. Nobody pushes Joe Tynan out of bed. Oh yeah? - How do you do that? - I jog. I have very strong legs. You want to try again? Am I sleepy. - Come here. - I won't. - Yes. - No. - I'm a virgin. - Not for long. Tiger. You look too good. You're gonna lose votes. Proxmire can do 60 of these. Have you seen this? Edward Anderson, yeah. The President assured me he was going to nominate him to... fill Perkins' place on the Supreme Court. But he wasn't going to announce it until next week. I wonder why this leaked? I don't know. Can I see you in your private office? Yeah, sure Senator. Come on. Good morning, Senator. What's going on here? Who's trying to block Anderson? You think somebody's trying to block him? 20 years ago, Anderson said some things during a campaign... that wouldn't sound so good today. But the man's moderate. You don't have to worry about him. Senator, I don't know the man. Now look I don't care if you vote against him... just don't make him a problem for me. Like what? Like leading the opposition. I shouldn't have any trouble with this... unless some flaming liberal like you makes a fuss. I'll give Anderson my most careful consideration. - You keep any bourbon down here? - Sure. You know, Joe... some folks back home are saying I'm beginning to get too old. That my stroke has left me feeble. That's a lot of bull, but... They got somebody very attractive running against me... And I'd rather not take this man on if I can avoid it. I'm wondering if you can guess who he is. - Edward Anderson. - If he's on the Supreme Court... he's out of running for life... and he happens to be eminently qualified. I understand, Sir. - Can I count on you? - Sure. Well you vote against him if you like, but... just don't start a crusade, alright? Fine, Senator. Are you with me? I won't oppose you. Fine. Piss on them, with their self satisfied talk of old age. They think they ain't gonna get old? They just have to wait a while. Don't take any talent to get old. Whence that idea of eternal youth? Answer me that, mon vieux. I don't speak French, Senator. You vote against him, but just don't make a fuss. Listen my friend... it's not worth the trouble. You should read what Stendhal said about it. It's all there. He said it all. I won't oppose you on this. Senator? And I told him you wouldn't come out against Anderson? You told him that? Maybe he won't remember. His guy just had me on the phone nailing it down. Goddammit. Can I have that file on ageing please? I wish you'd make him ask twice, at least he'd owe us something. Angela, I have the status of the bills on ageing in the House for you. - Ok. I'll write it up for you. - Thank you. How bad can Anderson be? Arthur Briggs of the NAACP told me he's a racist. Racist? The man has come out publicly in favour of segregated schools. Jesus Christ. Senator Henry Goodfellow... director of the National Civil Rights Coalition is on three. Says it's urgent. Can you take it? His name is Henry? Henry, how are you? No, I have not come out in favour of Anderson. It's only a rumour. Joe Tynan is not gonna back a racist. Yeah. Henry, how's Florence? Yeah, give her my best. Ok. Bye bye. Francis, if I fought Birney on this, I'd be against the... most powerful man in the Senate, and the President. I'd get my brains knocked out. If you were to establish yourself as the big kid on the block... - Birney's the one to beat. - He's also a friend. Yeah, well... Of course, this is a decision that no one can make for you. Let's see what Arthur Briggs has to say. Anderson may be a moderate to Senator Birney... but he's certainly no moderate to us. I'm still not convinced the man is all that bad. I mean people do rise to the office. I would like to read you something. "In my heart, I have never accepted integration... and I never will." How would you feel about the man who said that? Not so good. Mrs Traynour is a fine labour lawyer. She's also our local Counsel in Louisiana. She knows Anderson's background. Whoever leads a fight against Anderson is going to get a lot of attention. Someone's getting a lot of ink out of this. But, if you choose not to take him on... we're gonna release a statement to the press ourselves. Then, as the fiery liberal from New York, I'll have to go him anyway. That will be up to you, Senator. Very nice, Arthur. I would need more than this. I can't quote him out of context. There's film on him saying this. And there has to be a consistent pattern showing him unfit. You'll have it, Senator. Get me that, and I'm with you. Senator, thank you. We'll be in touch. I'll call you at the end of the week. Nice to meet you, Mrs Traynour. Arthur. Looks like we're in for a fight. - This man's not a racist. - He is to them. And it's also a hell of an opportunity. I don't think I should betray a friend just for an opportunity. Politics and politicians... it's not a popular subject, particularly on talkshows. Everyone wants entertainment and to forget about their problems. For so long the public hasn't trusted their public officials, but... of all the people in politics... the public loves you. We see it in your mail... when you've been on in the past. Thank you. That's high praise. You talk to some of the best. I'm curious, somebody just told me, your son ran for President. - Of his class, yes. - Oh, of his class. It was really very interesting. A great wave of anxiety at home. Because we wanted him to win... We took a speech of mine and tailored it for him... to give in the class... and he really was wonderful with that speech. He gave that speech about as well as it could be given. - How'd he do? - He lost. Oh shit. I'm sorry, Paul. Did I embarrass you? He lost gracefully. And that's one of the best things to learn, is how lose with a smile... and he smiled right up until the point he broke down. I want to get a little personal. You're private about your home life. And you live in Westchester. What is it? How's everything going with you? Lousy. Why? What's the matter? - You want to know? - Yeah. - Really? - Janet, what's the problem? Life sucks. I see. What do you mean, life sucks? It sucks. In what way exactly does it suck? Every way. You're not being very explicit. I'm not very happy, ok? Whatever you're going through Mum and I have probably gone through it. Use us. - Maybe I'll talk to Mama. - Ok. I'll get her. No. I mean someday. You don't have to tell us anything personal you know. But when you're ready... a little hint. Ok? Ok. I'll see you later. No. Karen Traynour, Congresswoman Cenza. - Hello. - Oscar Harris. - Nice to meet you. - You know Francis. Ok, Joe. We'll be in touch. - Good to see you again. - Goodbye, Joe. Francis. Find out if Halloren is gonna be against us on this. Right. - Sorry if I was interrupting. - No, you're right on time. - Can I get you a cup of coffee? - No thanks. Too cold out here for you? No, I love the cold. So... How's it going? I'm not crazy about admitting it, but I'm having trouble getting that film. If it's not there, it's not there. It's there. Somebody's holding it back. A black woman. I can't believe it. - Can you get to her? - It's Carla Willis. You know her. - Yeah, she's going for Congress. - Yeah. Somebody on her staff can a hold of a kinescope of him making that... "in my heart" speech. She won't use it and won't give it up. I think she's made a deal. How would you feel about talking to her? - I don't know. - I think you should. I think you are the most exciting political figure in the country today. And when I think about the splash you could make if you had this film... I get weak in the knees. And of course, it's the right thing to do. I'm speaking in Houston on Friday right? That's right. I come to New Orleans on Saturday, and we'll talk to her. How's that? Senator, this is gonna make a big difference. Mrs Traynour, that film is ours. You and your stupid friends, just stay out of my stuff, ok? - I'm not even in your room. - You're always in there. - Bullshit. - Will you stop swearing you shit. What is going on up there? He probably read one of her love letters. They'll work it out. Jesus Christ. Joe, they can work this thing out without a parent. They don't need a parent, they need a referee. Hey, come on. Cut it out. Joe, come here. Sit down. What are you doing? I'm trying to figure out my reactions to one of my patients. Everyday I make the same notes over and over. Nothing new. It's like following you in a campaign. Listening to you make that same speech day after day. Damn. Didn't I read in Time magazine that you have a great sense of humour? That's why I'm not laughing. That's good. That's good. I may not like politics, but I love you. - Excuse me. - That's alright. Yeah, but you know, I'm a politician. I mean, I am politics. You're a good, decent man who's in politics. If you ever are politics... What? Would you still love me? I'll have to get back to you on that one. If she touches my racket once more, I'll break her camera. Got that? - Right. - Just so you know that. Oh God. When will we all grow up? Any of us? - Do you mind if I drive? - No, not at all. - How long you been flying? - Long time. I think 2 weeks is a long time, don't you? I was right about Carla Willis. - She made a deal. - How do you know? I asked her Louisiana Democratic Chairman. And he told you? He's my daddy. Full of surprises, aren't you? So you've been in politics all your life? When I was a little girl, I used to go campaigning with my daddy... on every one of those roads down there. - Wasn't that hard on you? - It was that or never see him. - This is flying, isn't it? - Yeah, this is great. I can't buy a Congressional campaign on what I make from soy beans. I need the support of the Democratic organisation. The man is headed for the Supreme Court. He'll affect this country for as long as he lives. Times have changed. He's not that bad. How bad does he have to be, Carla? I was in Catahoula parish when my daddy... came down here and supported you for legislature. I remember what you said that night about the people you grew up with. You remember that? How bad does he have to be? You ask your daddy... if I get the Democratic nomination if I help you destroy Anderson. Mrs Willis, I didn't want to go after Anderson either. I have a lot to loose if I fail on this. But you have a lot to gain if you win. And I won't forget you when I win. And I will win. He's gonna win. I want the voters of this county to know... that regardless of what I've said in the past... or that I might say in the future... in my heart, I have never accepted integration and I never will. - I guess I better get that. - Alright. I don't answer it any more. One of Joe's constituents called once and offered to blow up our house. Well... There's a lot of pressure in a political family. Joe's a public figure. I'm trying to do other things. Hello? Yeah Francis? You've become a psychologist lately? I've just been accepted as a fellow at the Karen Horney Institute. I have my own case load. It's very exciting. How did you get interested in that? Were you in therapy? I was. Yes. A lot of political people are reluctant to talk about therapy. I certainly don't think treatment's anything to be ashamed of. It's my profession. Has it been difficult being a political wife? It was at the beginning, yes. During Joe's first campaign they had me out stumping for him. We were running ourselves ragged, I had a miscarriage. Joe couldn't take me to the hospital. One of his aides checked me in. It was a nightmare for both of us. Just get them on, alright. Tell them that's part of the deal. Alright. Goodbye. Is that when you went into therapy? I thought I needed a few sessions to get my head straight. 6 years later I was thinking it would go on till after my death. I guess I'm not too thrilled with politics. I'm sorry. What did I miss? I've heard it all before. I guess you can tell Ellie is a very special woman. Ok. Come on. What is it? It's your life. I'm not gonna tell you not to talk about it. I think that's a good idea. You know what it costs to talk like that to reporters. To say I've been in therapy? 60 votes. I didn't say you were in therapy. That would mean 1000 votes. Analysis is 6000 votes. Lithium is 20,000 votes. Electroshock go for 60,000 each. I know what things cost. Look, these people ask anything they can. Don't dig into your bowels for every question about the furniture. She wasn't asking about the furniture. She was asking about me. It's taken me 7 years, but I think I know how to tell the difference. How could you get her to let you run down politics like that? I didn't want to do the interview. I told you that. Ellie, how much do I ask you to do? You live a life entirely apart from politics. No I don't. I can't escape it for a minute. I can't call a plumber without being Mrs Joe Tynan. "Yes, Mrs Tynan. I worked on the Senator's toilet a few years ago." I'm living in a fish bowl. It's a bit late to think of that? When was I supposed to think of it? When you decided to run for Senate without asking me? When I heard your decision to run for re-election on television? I discussed that with you. You said you were thinking about it. What did you expect me to do? It was there, wasn't it? You're never gonna give anything any thought as long as it's there? What about today, Ellie? I was asked questions about my life. I answered. Next time, for God's sake, handle it. Help a little. Next time you handle it. And next week when they come to take our pictures for that interview... stand with your arms around your administrative assistant. This is sensational. Where did you get all this stuff? A lot of digging. Terrific. Thank you. I'll tell you what I would like. I would love to work with you when you make your move. I think we would knock them right on their fannies. You really like to win, don't you? When I want something, I go get it. Just like you. I have some more notes in my briefcase. I have a 1970 decision on segregation... that makes him look really bad. What are you smiling at? I'm not sure. What do you think you're smiling at? Well, I think that... something may be happening that we didn't expect. What do you think? I was hoping we were gonna have the brains not to mention it. We don't have to do anything about it, but there's no harm in being honest. You have no idea how many times I've thought of you since New Orleans. Yeah I do. You know, I have a husband. I'm not suggesting anything. However, I do notice that I... I want this Anderson thing to go on forever. I think I'm infatuated with you. You remind me of John F. Kennedy. Oh boy. I've never heard that one before. You do. If you looked just behind his eyes... His intelligence, his wit... his compassion, just like you. Did you make a pass at Kennedy? Is this a pass? - I think this is a pass. - Yeah. Yeah? I'll have to call later. Alright. Ok. Yeah. Put him through down here. It's my son. He said it's an emergency. Paul? What? What rabbit? Oh yeah. What's the matter? Why won't she let you keep it in your room? It's gonna smell up the whole house. No wait. I can't talk to her right now. Ok. Alright. Put her on. Hiya? Maybe you can keep it in the basement. You won't smell it there. Maybe it's not the rabbit, it's him. Ellie, I'll be home for the weekend. Ok. Me too. I'll see you in a couple of days. Bye bye. Joe, I think I'd better go. No, wait a minute. Just a second. Please. You weren't faking with her. So, I don't think I want you faking with me. What would you think about living in Washington? You mean move there? I think I need you down there. No. I wanted to move to Washington when you first got elected Senator. You said to stay here so we could have the weekends to ourselves. Now we don't have weekends any more. I have to lecture. You "have" to lecture. Do you think I can live on what I make as a Senator? And what about my work? Isn't there a psychoanalytic institute in Washington? I guess there is, but... the one that's accepted me is in New York. And the man I work with, the man who's brought me along to this point... is also in New York. I don't just work in a building. There are people who mean something to me. Joe. Really... Think about Washington, will you? - You got your raincoat? - It's in my bag. You gonna have some coffee? I haven't got time, honey. - Isn't that your line? - Yeah. It's probably the office. I'll call them back later. Can I drive you to the airport? I have a driver downstairs. Thanks. Where will you be going? New York, Rome then Tunis. Didn't my girl send your girl the itinerary? She probably couldn't believe it was our only means of communication. When you get to Italy, you call me? Sure. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Hello? - Karen, its' Joe. - Hi. - You're kind of hard to reach. - Yeah. - Listen on the Anderson thing... Yeah? I need to do more with you. Can you come up to Washington? I can't, Joe. The hearings are in 3 weeks. I need your help with a line of questioning. - Nobody else can do that? - You did most of the research. I don't see how I can. When would you want me there? How about tomorrow? No, I have a problem. I'm trying to settle a strike. I thought that's what this call was. Ok, Wednesday. I really need you. I need your expertise. Well... You're not gonna quit when we're so close to winning, are you? Alright. Alright. Wednesday, Joe. - But listen... - Yeah? This is just work, right? Karen the hearings are in 3 weeks. I need help. I mean if you sit on the couch and I don't... - that's not gonna make you smile? - Why would that make me smile? I'll see you Wednesday, Joe. I'm not sure it's worth the extra expense. I think she'll work out fine. I think Karen Traynour is terrific, but... I don't know if we can get much more mileage out of her. No, I want to work some more with her on this, Francis. I've already asked her. Fine. I'm sure she's very knowledgeable. Yeah. She can make a difference. Yeah. I'll get her a room at the Fairfax and you can work with her there. - Fine. - I'll take care of that myself. Fine. - Hi. - Hi. I spent a lot of time on the plane working on notes for this meeting. Good. We'll... We'll go over it together. Yeah, good. - This place have a bedroom? - I don't know. I just got here. Oh God, you taste good. Can you... I can't get my arm out. - What? - I can't get my arm out. Listen, I'm gonna... I'm gonna sound like an idiot talking about this now... but I want to be honest with you. I know. You're married. I know. So am I. That's ok. You're very demonstrative. You never love made love to a Democrat? This affair's gonna put 20 pounds on me. How come you don't just smoke after, like normal people? I'm very oral. So I noticed. What's his name? - My husband? - Yeah. Barry. Barry? Sounds very upper. He works his way upper. You'd probably like him. What's he doing while you're here? He's in... Tunis. He travels a lot. That I like. Is your wife as smart as they say in all the magazines? Sorry, I wish I could tell you she had the brains of chorus girl. Unfortunately, just the body of one. That's cute. That's really cute. Jesus. I think you froze it. You alright? Come here. Yeah, it's true. Things do contract in the cold. You southerners are all nuts. I talked to my daddy. I got some terrific stuff you can use against Anderson. Yeah? Like what? Campaign contributions... Two corporations made secret contributions. That's great. We don't even have to use it. - I can just tell them I got it. - Yeah. Yeah, that's good. Oh my God. You are gonna be so fantastic in this hearing. Do you know how far you're gonna go with this? When you get there... clip me a rose from the rose garden and send it to me, ok? She had the biggest tits I ever saw, Joe. If I ever fell into a pot of honey, that was it. I said... "Look here young lady, I am US Senator. What if someone comes in here and finds me in the public toilet... in flagrant poontang while I'm flying over my state?" Then, Christ. She threw a fit it was wonderful. She acted so needy. I just had to give in, you know what I mean? Afterwards... Afterwards she gave me this card that says I'm a... member of the Mile High Club. For doing it over 6000 feet. You are the genuine article. It was a religious experience. Son, I felt close to God. Today I had a visit from some guys representing labour unions. They tell me that they have you on this Anderson thing. - They had me? - I said, "Listen... it's high time the South was represented on the Supreme Court. This means a lot to Senator Birney and it means a lot to me too. I'm sure Senator Tynan will talk this over before coming out against us. Well, Hugh... I'm sure Birney will get what he wants. He usually does. What do you say we go partners on those two over there? I'll give you 60 bucks if that blond ain't a screamer. Are you crazy? That's somebody's wife. Ain't nobody's wife any more than I am. That's Hutchin's wife, the freshman from Minnesota. Jesus H. Goddamn hippies don't even marry women that look like wives. Hi. - Hey Joe. - Althena. Come sit next to me for a minute. I really don't think you ought to be seen talking to that horse's ass. - Which one? - My husband. Look at him talking to that shit Cardoza. He's got the same taste in business associates that he does in women. Why don't you come over to my house sometime... and we'll have an affair? When was the last time you and Hugh took a vacation together? Took a vacation together? I won't sleep with him, I won't even drink out of the same cup. - You want to do me a favour? - What? Get me another... glass of this bourbon. Are you sure? Why don't you just go screw yourself? Would you get me another real big glass of bourbon? - Yes, Madam. - Thank you. Can I get you something to eat? And spoil all this good bourbon? Don't be silly. Go on. Mingle, Joe. Oh my God. Would you look at that one? Who in the hell do you suppose brought her? I don't think anyone brought her. I see. She's freelancing. That lady might stand to make 60 dollars real easy tonight. That is if she can get up the stairs 10 or 12 times. You know Congressman Tiller? - Yes, how are you? - How are you Senator. Senator Joe Tynan, Karen Traynour. Yes, we've met. - How are you? - Fine. How have you been? Fine. - You know Mary Cenza. - Hello. I am starving. They got any food here? In the other room they have chicken salad in the shape of Louisiana. You want to stay? There's a good restaurant at your hotel. That sounds convenient. Why don't we see what they have inside first? - Excuse us. - Nice to see you again. Let's give her room. Look out. Give her room. Get this thing out of her way. Watch out, honey. Hold it. Hold it. Jesus. What an asshole. How could you go there with him? I thought you weren't gonna get involved. How could you go anywhere with him? The man is a renown jerk. He was perfectly adequate for what I needed him for: Someone to past the evening with. - How do you know him? - He's my Congressman. You're in bigger trouble than I thought. So are you. Senator Kittner always lands on his feet. I don't know sometimes. He's driving me nuts. He's a wildman. Instead of talking legislation, he talks about sex. I'm trying to go over his defence bill... and he wants to bet 16 dollars the waitress isn't wearing panties. Francis, Senator Tynan isn't gonna go out in front against Anderson, is he? No, he's just voting against him. I'm sure that's as far as it'll go. Francis, how big a problem do I have? Is your boss gonna make a big thing out of this? Nothing that your guys can't handle. Sure, John. Oh shit. Senator? We've got a problem. We've lost Senator Tynan on the Anderson thing. John, I'm kinda busy now. I'm reading here. I don't mean we've just lost his vote, He's gonna lead the opposition? Yeah. Well, John... I'm reading here from my pad. Senator, we could have a real...? Maybe we could discuss this later. Yes. I'm reading right now. Right. Well I'll just... Right. Would you ask Tynan to come down for some gumbo... in my private office? What? My private office in the basement. Right. I'll get right on it. Son. - Close the door when you go out. - Yeah. I got a red pepper in here grows only on the shores of hell. - Here it comes. - Not for me. I might need my stomach later. How bout it, Joe? You only live once. - Hugh, I can't. - Come on. I just swallowed the roof of my mouth. - Have some good Southern cooking. - Jesus H. In Baton Rouge this is baby food. Hugh, you are so full of shit I can't believe it. - You haven't had one spoonful. - Son... - I'll match you bite for bite. - Go ahead, Hugh. Divide that in half. In half? There's almost 4 pounds in here. I know, for a country boy like you this is just an appetiser. You're never gonna see... Oh, my plate. You're never gonna see the bottom of this dish, kid. I'll give the winner a buck for every second under 2 minutes. Go. Come on, Joe. Get him. Think I'm gonna be sick. This here's a Goddamn Shriner's convention? Can I get something for you? What about a noise maker and a hat. Never happened to me before. I think I have the flu. Must be it. It's not my opinion this man is gonna change his mind... just because you two have thrown up together. Are you gonna fight us on Edward Anderson or not? You know how much I respect you... Yes or no? - I'll answer you but... - Listen, my friend. I asked you a very simple question. - Senator, now hold it. - Yes or no? Hurry up, sir. I am fed up... Cut it out. You understand what I'm saying? Yeah, I do. I sure as hell don't. He just don't want to be pressured that's all. Who does? Thing is, I think we can find a way to see each other's point of view. Don't you think we can? Sure. Why not? How about a beer, Senator? - You're my favourite Senator. - How are you? You're wonderful. Would you give me your autograph for my daughter? - Yeah. - She thinks you're wonderful. And you're wonderful too. I've read your a psychologist. My son's interested in that. Ok, thank you. Goodbye. Bye. May I help you, Senator? Yes. Hi. - Where's the pro shop? - Out the front door, to the left. Out, it's to the left here. Why are we going to the Pro shop? Because the guy who just waved at me is Senator Aikers of Minnesota. - So now we're gonna play golf? - I don't know how to hold a club. No, got to go. Hello. Hi. Jesus. Hi, Senator. Can I help you? Yes, we'd like to rent some clubs and a golf cart and... balls and things. Sure, you want to come over here? You want to hold it down? Try to look like a golfer. People don't laugh like that on a golf course. - Where are we going? - I'm looking for privacy. There. - Oh no. - There. ¡No. ¡No. ¡No. Oh God. Will you stop laughing? I can't. I can't help it. What do we have to eat? Al? Remove that. Here. - Hi. You need a lift? - Hi. - Where you going? - Just seeing some friends. I don't want to get your defences up, but what are you doing hitch-hiking? Don't worry, I'm careful. You're not allowed to hitch-hike. Why not? It's really dumb. I'm not gonna get murdered. You're not gonna go round doing anything you damn please. You're getting your wings clipped. What does that mean? We're going to start living a normal life. How? What are you talking about? I'm talking about the whole family living in the same house. Where? I'm thinking of moving to Washington. No. No way. I'm not going. It's not gonna be easy on any of us. Mum, no. I don't want to go. I can't. You can't make me leave my friends. Please. Janet. It's not good for us like this. - Dad misses us a lot. - Then let him move. - He can't. His work is there. - I'm not going. - I'm not going. - No, Janet. Close that door. That door now. Come on home with me, ok? We'll have a cup of tea and we'll talk. About what? About nothing. We'll just calm down. - What's for desert? - Fruit compote. Terrific. I haven't had that in a long time. - Don't give me any. - Why not? It's got prunes in it. When was the last time you tried it? When I was too little to fight back. Don't even let me smell it. - Try it. It's good for you. - Where's your curiosity? - Dad's right, it's an adventure. - Eating prunes is an adventure? Not really. We lie. Here. I don't want this. It's got sugar. Where are you going? Sit down. Let's have a little conversation. What do you want to talk about? Whatever comes up. Sit down. I haven't been home in 3 weeks. How was that paper you did on Roosevelt? How'd it turn out? I told you. I got an A on it. Right, I forgot. I'm sorry. Can I read it? They're keeping it for the student fair. Are you coming to that? - When is that? - I told you, May 11. No, I can't. I got to be in Washington. - I'm sorry. - No, that's ok. I think you made a really good choice with Roosevelt. He's a really fascinating man. - He had... - Can I go? You always talk about things that don't interest me. So we'll include you. How's your bike? Did you fix the chain? In that case, can I go? I'm sick of his bike. - Why don't you shut it? - Goodbye. Paul. Dad, that game's on. Go ahead. I'll talk to you later. I really love a close knit family like this. You were rushing them. You have to talk about what interests them. I tried to talk about what interests them. You were doing all the talking. - Senator. - Sorry, can't right now. Pardew, the coal mine safety measures and health standards. He's giving up some ground but what he's got left is still strong. Ok. Fine. Hi, how are you? Good to see you. - How's it look? - Head count not so good. Write me up something and we'll use it later, ok? - Mr Treadwell. - No. Mr Travis. No. - Mr Tynan. - Aye. - How's it going, Ed? - They're killing us. - It's an excellent amendment. - Mr Arthur Lewis. No. - It'll save a few lives. - Mr Ervin. If you don't get it passed this session, you will next time. - I won't be here next session. - Mr Mc Carro. I've had enough. After a while you start to forget what you're here for. Then getting clout and keeping it is all there is. You start lying to your constituents, your colleagues... to everybody... and you forget what you thought you cared most about in life. Among the courtesy calls Mr Anderson made today... was one to the office of Senator Joe Tynan. Why didn't somebody tell me to get my cowlick down? I think you look sincere this way. Look at that. I had a very frank and very useful talk with Mr Anderson. I find him a straightforward man. - Will you support his nomination? - No, I'm afraid I can't. Are you going to lead the opposition against Mr Anderson? Well if I can be of any help to my colleagues... I'd be happy to confer with them on this. Well, there it is. I wonder if Birney's heard this yet. Can't expect to loose votes at home. The man's a realist. If the President likes Mr Anderson... he should be considered carefully. We're not gonna be capricious. Senator Birney's office just called. He wants to see you right away. - That was quick. - Good luck. - I'll be back in half an hour. - Give them hell. You see the Boy Scouts in 46 minutes. Right. Does the opposition have enough to go against the President? Senator, I'm not looking to dethrone you. I've always thought we were friends. So have I. What will you do if the Senate starts lining up against you on this? I was counting on you to stop them. Isn't that asking a lot? Of a friend? Joe, they're after me. I stand convicted of being an old man. Joe, I need your help. I'll owe you. Why does this have to be over Anderson? He could destroy me. I didn't draw the lines for this battle. I didn't either. I'd hoped you'd remember that. I can't let you do this to me. Not with the whole Senate watching. This would hurt me very badly at home. You can live with this. I know you can because I've lived with worse. You just want to get some mileage out of this... Save the country from a disastrous appointment... - make yourself a hero. - No I don't, Senator. The hell you don't. If I were you I wouldn't put the Presidential seal on my shorts yet. You do this... and no bill of yours will ever get out of my committee. It'll take time, but I got a lot of friends around here... and your little subcommittee ain't gonna have much of a budget. You'll look about as glamorous as a toad with a tyre track on its back. How does that sound to you? Thanks for the bourbon, Senator. Is this a direct quote? Yeah. Look, stay away from voter registration. He's got himself covered there. Stick to schooling. Here, "Laycock vs. Louisiana". Just read him that, ask him if he said it. "Nothing can compel a community to open its doors to any group... which it fears for its very survival. This is the principle of self defence which precedes all others." Did you say that, Mr Anderson? You're quoting me out of context, Senator. I am not, sir. Let me ask the clerk to hand you a copy of your opinion... in "Laycock vs. The State of Louisiana". You can read any sentence you like, Mr Anderson. Mr Anderson... Wasn't your decision in this case overturned by a higher court... in a matter of hours? Yes, Senator. And hours after that I directed the State of Louisiana to comply. In just hours? What about the fact that it's been 20 years... since the Supreme Court ordered your schools integrated? You can't change old ways overnight. You have to learn to crawl before we can walk. 20 years, Mr Anderson. We got people on the moon and you can't walk yet? We will have quiet in this room. There will be no more outbursts or we will clear the room. In as much as Senator Birney has returned... we will return the gavel to the Chairman of this committee. Mr Anderson... when you were Attorney General of the State of Louisiana... you worked to tone down a... desegregation plan, didn't you? Yes sir, I did. Would you tell us why, Mr Anderson? Because the schools would have closed Senator. Forced integration didn't work in Boston today... and it wasn't working in the South 16 years ago. I found a compromise... that allowed children of both races to continue to go to school. Mr Chairman, I'd like to point out I still have 6 minutes... under the rules to question the nominee. Certainly, Senator Tynan. Go right ahead. Thank you, Mr Chairman. I felt that you are a decent man. I'm not impugning your basic motives. But do you feel in your public life, you've devoted yourself to carrying... out the spirit of the lay? To the best of my ability, Senator. When you said... "if the Supreme Court wants to put crime in the schools, let them... but we don't have to send our children there... was that to the best of your ability? Was it when you raised funds for segregated private schools? When you said, "In my heart, I've never accepted integration... and I never will", was that to the best of your ability? Now that is untrue. Would you like to see the film I have of you saying that? What about the Law of the Land? What about simple human justice? Order. - I have no further questions. - Order. Can I have order here. I want order. Order, we will have here. These proceedings will be conducted with dignity. I remind our guest that this is a Senate hearing. And not a circus. This is not a roman circus. In what manner are we conducting our meetings, my friends? Allow me to remind you this is not a comedy. - Mr Chairman. - Let us remember... the words of Mr Stendhal... with which he begins la "Rouge et Noir". - Mr Chairman. - "The village of Verrières... may be one of the most beautiful of the French County. It is a sense of peace I seek here." Mr Chairman, if I may... "in it's white houses with their pointed roofs... of red tile, spread over the hillside..." Mr Chairman. "Where the hardy chestnut trees... mark a grand sinuosity". "Monsieur" La Chairman. In a victory for Senator Joe Tynan... the President withdrew the nomination of Anderson to the Supreme Court. And has instead submitted the name of Richard Emerson. Confirmation is expected within days. Might this be a trampoline into a presidential office? I'm glad the governor has confidence in me... but I think that's premature. Isn't it true that Professor Woodruff from Harvard... has come to Washington to advice you on foreign policy matters? Yes, that's right. If you have no ambitions for higher office... why the sudden need for a foreign policy advisor? Richard, I think that... this is the greatest deliberative body in the world... because it doesn't simply concern itself with parochial interests. We're not only concerned with our states, but with world events. I think every Senator has that responsibility. Senator, someone has said you've engaged a speech coach of some kind. - Is that true? - You think I need one, Frank? - Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. - Thank you. First of all let's kill the speech coach. Let's set up some interviews with... the editorial boards of a few good newspapers, ok? - You know whatever. - Ok. Let's start hitting the people we got cards on. - Money letter? - No. Not yet. Let's send a letter to their special interest. "Dear Clyde, I've been giving a lot of thought to the state of our nation... especially..." whatever... pollution, racism, whatever we have him coded for. "I need your ideas, your intuition, your passion." Then we'll hit them for money. Senator Joe Tynan speaks on our national energy crisis. 6 seconds. Why should an 86 year old woman freeze to death... in her own apartment in Pennsylvania? Don't open your eyes wide like that. It's honest and sincere, but it's not fatherly. You've got to show a quiet strength. Don't be afraid to be a little bit more butch. You're head is tilted. You got to keep it straight. That's butch. Bring it around to foreign entanglements, that sort of thing. Why should such important decisions... Senator Joe Tynan of our State of New York is with us... Senator, the President's calling on line 2. There's a call for you in the control room. It's your wife. - Ellie? - Hi. We've got a problem. It's Janet. She woke up with a fever of 104. - Did you call Sam? - He just left. He thinks she has viral hepatitis. What makes him so sure it's that? Her skin is yellow. It seems she's had herself tattooed. What? - That's what I said. - Tattooed? I never saw any tattoos on her. It's on her behind. - Put her on the phone. - I can't. She's sleeping. - I want to talk to her. - Joe, she's sleeping. What's she got it on her behind for? Who's gonna see it there? I was wondering the same thing. I mean... What is it? Does it say something? It's a flower. A tulip. Jesus. A tulip. On her behind. One second. Hi. What? I just wanted to see how you're doing. Can I come in? Can I call you back in a few minutes? Yeah. Ok. Bye-bye. - You're fever's down. - Yeah. I'm bored to death. - To get well, you have to rest. - No kidding? Can I ask you a question? Why did you get a tattoo? No. You can't ask me. What's that? I got you some daisies from the garden. - Oh yeah? - I wasn't very smart. I've got anything to put them in. Put them in the water glass. Thanks. They're nice. You know? We ought to know more about what's going on in each other's lives. Yeah? Like what? You're seeing a boy and I don't really know him. You don't know him at all. I'd like to meet him sometime. - Why? - Because you're my daughter. Will you just leave me alone? No, I'm not gonna leave you alone. Goddammit, I love you. Don't you think I'm old enough my own friends. Of course you are. I just want to meet them. Why? So I can know what you're going through. - What for? - Because I love you, Goddammit. I'm sorry I raised my voice. And every time you tell me you love me, you say "Goddammit". I don't understand what went through your head. You must have known that a tattoo doesn't come off. I don't want it to come off. How are you going to explain that later? I don't have to explain my Goddamn ass to anybody. - Calm down. - It's my ass, isn't it? As long as your ass is in this house I have to watch out for it. Will you just leave me alone? I'm not leaving until I get some kind of response from you. Yeah? Ok. - That's not what I had in mind. - Get out. - Go on. - Alright. Calm down. Janet. What? Don't you know that I love you... that I just want to be closer to you? Don't you understand that? No. Why? You're not here that much, are you? Janet. Open the door. No. Just for a second, please. Then I'll go. Please. No. How did I lose her? You didn't. She adores you. She says I'm never here. Why don't you take her away next weekend? Up to the barn, alone. Talk with her. Picnic. Have some fun. I have a fundraiser at the Hilton next weekend. Tell them your sick. What are you doing? Here. Francis? No. Everything's fine. Listen, that fundraiser at the Hilton next week... I want to cancel that. Why not? Well so what? Who do I represent? The White House or New York? Tell him I can't. Why? Why? What are they offering? Yeah. Is that definite? I'll call you later. What are they offering you? There's a lot of bullshit going back and forth. But what it boils down to is if I do a selling job... on the New York Committee... then I can give the nominating speech at the Convention. What about Janet? Come on, Ellie. Talking about the nominating speech. Jesus. What do you want me to do? Nothing, Joe. I want you to do whatever you want. I guess what makes my husband special is how much he cares. Not just about the people who can afford 100 dollars a plate... but about people who cannot afford to eat. I'm very proud of being Mrs Joe Tynan. Thank you for honouring us tonight. You were just great. Senator, I just wanted to pay my respects. Dick Harman, I'm Chairman of the Louisiana state committee. - Yes. How are you? - Delightful speech, Mrs Tynan. I want to thank you for your help. Not at all. I think you know my daughter. - Oh yes, hello. - Don't get up. Rolf, how are you? Ellie, this is Karen Traynour. She gave us help on Anderson. She was wonderful. It was a wonderful job you did. Mrs Traynour is a lawyer. Is it Mrs Traynour or Miss? Mrs - Mrs., right. And she gave us all this great stuff on Anderson, that... May I have your attention, please? Daddy, I think we'd better go. - Glad to see you, Senator. - Nice to meet you. - Keep punching. - Ok. I now have an honour that comes too seldom in politics. A chance to introduce a man... who deserves all the good words that you can find for him. Six years ago this guy tried to have me thrown out of the Senate. He is a man who believes in putting the people first. And now ladies and gentlemen... Senator Joe Tynan. He'll just be another minute. He started leaving 26 minutes ago. It's great though, isn't it? Holding his coat? No, how things are moving. He can go all the way now. All the way where? We're giving him a more national image. We've got a new press aide. We've got an advisor on international affairs. We're really moving. Is that so? Listen we have to have a little talk. We're starting to play for really high stakes now. We have to watch what kind of face we present to the media. I got hold of that McCall's interview you gave. I was really floored. I mean, she had you in analysis. - What's wrong with that, Francis? - Analysis is usually a code word. It means you have a drinking problem or worse. That was our fault really. From now on you won't give an interview without one of us. We can't just throw you to the wolves like that. Would you excuse me please? Don't worry. I fixed it. All the article says now is that you have an interest in psychology. It's ambiguous. It could mean anything. Look, I know you're not crazy about this... but don't you think we should discuss it? There's only one thing I have to say to you and it's not ambiguous. Wait. What the hell is the idea leaving me 30 miles from home without a car? You son of a bitch. Jesus Christ. You broke it. Get out. - Cut it out. - Out. Stupid. Take this crap out of my bedroom. Ellie. Stop it. Christ. What's going on? Go back in your room. Go to sleep. Will you stop it? Jesus. When were you planning to tell me you were running for President? - At the inaugural ball? - Stop it. You tell her, and you won't tell me? What are you talking about? The lawyer you're screwing you son of a bitch. You want to wreck this house? Don't tell me you care about this house or anything in it. I hated you tonight, to think you would let that woman into our life. It's like someone has broken into my house and gone through my things. A stranger who knows everything about me. My habits, my weaknesses, even how I'm like in bed. How much does she mean to you? I don't really know. But I know what you mean to me. Really? Ellie, everything I care about in my life, we've made together. Do you think anything could ever mean as much to me as you? Not until tonight. I know how much I've hurt you. But it doesn't have to happen again, and it won't. Ellie, What can I say? What can I do? Nothing, Joe. I don't expect anything of you. I'm sorry, I don't. I know you don't really have any reason to, but... Please give me another chance. All I wanted was for you to love me. That's all. Ellie, I do. I do love you. Senator. Room 402 at the Raleigh. Hello? - Hi, it's me. - Hi. Guess who can stay the whole weekend. Oh God. I wish I could. I have to go home. My daughter's come down with hepatitis. Karen? Look, I think you ought to be with your wife. You don't have to make up stories. I'm not, she has hepatitis. She had hepatitis 4 weeks ago. How long does that last? She's not really over it. I'm not making up stories. I've seen this before. You're falling in love with your wife. Look, I need to talk to you. I'll be right over there. No. Maybe you better not. No, I have to talk to you. I'll be right there. Karen? Joe, I'm sorry. I got to go. Yes? Oh hi. Is this 402? Sure is. I saw your yesterday on the Mike Douglas show. It's nice to see you again. Mr Hasse, please come to the counter of United Airlines. You have a call. I heard you got them to hold my plane. You left without saying goodbye. I thought I would be the first to leave... while there was still time. I have to go home. - I have to. - I know. I've been ditching them in little ways and I... I can't. It's too... I had a speech prepared for this but I can't say it in an airport. That's ok. I've heard it before. Goodbye. Cut it, but make sure it's good. Ellie. Paul. Make sure the teleprompter guy gets that changed. - There's less than 6 minutes. - Fine. Where's Janet? She couldn't come. It's complicated. My fellow Americans... we have a new vision in this great land of ours... a new spirit, a new hope... and shining confidence that justice and decency... will guide us in our public hours. Francis, will you take... - Take Paul to his seat, will you? - Sure, Senator. I just want to talk to Mum for a minute. Senator, here's our schedule for today. After you speak, you're meeting with the national Chairman and his staff. Then interviews with the "Washington Post" and "New York Times". Ok. Fine. I'll see you. I'll sit by the podium. Folks, I need this room for a minute. Can I have the room? - Where's Janet? - I couldn't get her to come. - I've done a great job with her. - She'll be alright. - Will you be alright? - Yes, fine. What's the matter? Let's talk about it later, ok? No, tell me now. Not right before you go out. Later. No. Not later. Now. Go ahead, say it. Joe, I love you, but I can't take it any more. Ellie, don't do this. You have to give me another chance. I can... I can slow down. I can make time for the things I care about. You think so? 2 months ago you were in tears because you'd thought you'd lost Janet. You were gonna take her away. Did you? Then what is it you really care about? What? Ellie, I love you. Please stay. We're not married any more. Why should I stay with you? Because you've put 19 years into this marriage. You have a responsibility to it. And so do I. And I'm going to be there. Until Francis calls with another offer? No. I can take the energy that I put into work, and put it into our life. But will you? Ellie, I love you. Please stay. You're on, Senator. Ellie. Do well out there. Ellie. I'll take you to your seat. You'll be terrific. There is a man who has come to symbolise... that hope for justice and decency in government... and hope for humanity... to the cold grey halls of the Law. It is my great privilege to present to you... Senator Joe Tynan. We want Joe. We want Joe. We want Joe...
