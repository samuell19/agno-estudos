He wants to try me in a swish restaurant in Camden Town. Could be the big break, Mrs. Nolan. - Oh, I've never been in a Swiss restaurant. - No, swish. Posh. - Oh, well, I hope you're funny. - Oh, so do I, Mrs. Nolan. That's what I'll be paid for after all. (chuckles) Well, how are you? All right? - Oh, not so bad. My divorce came through this mornin'. (audience laughing) - Good. Good. - From my husband. We've been married 45 years. Thought we'd call it a day, though. - Well, you certainly picked a nice one.

(audience laughing) Right. Now, this morning, I want to look at the root of the problem with this department. As far as it is capable of analysis. One word springs to mind as I search for this root. That word... Is stupidity. (audience laughing) Because I hear you're complaining about pay. Is that right? You're saying things like, "We are not being paid enough." to one another. (audience laughing) And yet, while you say these words, you hold in your overworked, and underpaid hands at least one cigarette. (audience laughing) (audience laughing) These cigarettes reveal many things. But chiefly, they reveal that this money for which you are craving is to be spent upon instruments of death rather than of life. How could I possibly consider giving money to a group of people who are clearly so hellbent on self-destruction? (audience laughing) - Some of us don't smoke, sir. - Some lemmings don't jump off cliffs, Mr. Box. That doesn't stop the species being generally worthy of derision. Anyone else? - We do feel, sir, nevertheless, that we have some reasons for negotiations about pay. - Oh, that's encouraging, isn't it? I'd hate to feel that we were here for no purpose whatsoever. What are these reasons? - Well, I mean, basically, sir, we. Ah. (clears throat) Well, I mean, basically, sir, uh, we feel that our wages are below the, um, the norm. - Yes, well, that's easily explained, I'm afraid. As workers, you are below the normal. And you are therefore paid accordingly. Is that clear? - Uh, yes, sir. Yes. - Good. The door's the wooden thing in the wall behind you. (audience laughing) (phone ringing in distance) - Well, uh, perhaps you'd like to drop up with your stats. I'm sure we can work something out between us. (typewriter typing in distance) (audience laughing) - Ah! Lorraine. - Morning, Robert. - Um. What, uh... What do you do at nights? (audience laughing) - I, I beg your pardon? - You know. When, um. When it gets dark. (audience laughing) - Uh. W, well. - I'm, you know, I'm, uh, I'm just a little curious. (audience laughing) - Well, I, uh. - I mean, uh. Do you, uh... You eat at night? Or? Or, what? - Well, as a rule, really yes. - Ah-ha! Ah, yes! Yes! Well, ah. Yes, well, I do, actually, I, I quite often go to a pub on my way home, have, have one of these, these little bar things. (audience laughing) But, uh. But tonight I thought I'd really splash out on something a lot better. Go somewhere really nice. - Ah. Would you like me to join you? - No! No, no, no, no, no. (audience laughing) No, no. No, no, don't trouble yourself. No, it'll be, uh. Um. Yes. Yes. Yes! ("Smoke Gets in Your Eyes") If that'd be okay, yes! We could perhaps even, even go to the Saraceno in Camden Town. That little, a little Italian place behind the (mumbles). Actually, might be Greek. (alarm beeping) They number a lot of, uh, a lot of show business personalities amongst their clientele, apparently. They once found a glove there that belonged to Brian Clough. -[Guard] Who set off the smoke alarm? - Sorry, not us! Any course-- - Hey, what are you doing with that? - Oh! Oh! No, no, it's not me. Uh, look, uh, the glass, it's still intact, you see? (glass pings) (alarm sounds) - Hey, it's you! - Help, help, help, help, help! (alarm blaring) (workers exclaiming) Help, help, help, help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! (extinguisher whooshes) ("Smoke Gets in Your Eyes") (audience laughing) - Well, it hasn't changed much since I was last here, I must say. - Oh, when was that? - Last week. (laughing) But it has changed a lot since I first came here, many, many years ago now. There used to be a door over there by the bar. That's gone now, I see. Must be some sort of economy measure. Still. We're all having to tighten our belts a little, nowadays. - Yes. - It's a very large restaurant, isn't it? Spacious. Big. Big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big. Very funny word isn't it, big? It's one of those words, you know, that if you say it enough time, it seems to become nonsensical. Know what I mean? Big, big, big, big, big, big. (audience laughing) Bag. Baa. (audience laughing) Baag. Baa. Oh. (audience laughing) Ha, right. (audience laughing) (audience laughing) Oh! Ah! Ah! It's in French. Francais.

(audience laughing) Well, if you've got some wine there. - May I recommend the (speaking foreign language) - Perhaps a carafe of white? Do you think? - Yes. Yes. (speaking foreign language) (audience laughing) - So. You speak French. - Just a little. - I thought so Yes. Have, uh, have, uh, have you ever been to France? - Oh, yes! My father was stationed near Toulouse! - Oh, Toulouse! Yes. Very French, Toulouse. (audience laughing) What, uh, what, uh. What does your father do? - He's dead. - Oh, dead. Yes? (audience laughing) - Oh, d, d, oh, dead! Dead! Oh, d, d. Oh, dead! Oh, how-a, how-a, how-a how, how, how-a, how, how, how, how-a, how, how, how did he die? (audience laughing) - W, uh, well, he was drowned, actually. - Oh, drowned. Yes? (laughing) Right. Drowned. Like the Irish goldfish. (laughing) -[Man] Ladies and gentlemen, Dave Perry's here! (quirky piano music) (diners applauding) - And a very good evenin' to you all! Nice to see ya, to see ya! - Nice. - And, well, it's, it's nice to be here anyway. There's nothing like a nice place to eat, is there? And this is nothing like a nice place to eat. (audience laughing) Em, where was I? Oh, yes. Em, nice bit o'carpet you've got here. Friend of mine once said to me he had a carpet in his garden. I said, "What, a carpet in the garden?" He said, "Yes, a carpet in the garden." Well, I said, "What, a carpet in the garden?" And, he said, "Yes, come and look." So I went outside, and it was just this big hole in the ground. And I said, "Wait, where's the carpet?" And he said, "Well, what do you think that is? "I put the car in there every night." (audience groans) (laughing) (audience laughing) - Um. Oh, it's fun being funny, isn't it? My father was very funny, actually. He was a bit of a philosopher, too. He used to say, "Tomorrow is another day." He used to say. He was only wrong once. (laughing) (Robert laughing) (audience laughing) Haven't met my wife, have ya? She won a talent spotting competition last week for bein' the most talented spotty person present. (Robert laughs) I wouldn't say my wife was ugly, but we got a home improvement grant to lock her away in the attic. (Robert laughing) (audience laughing) Ya haven't seen my attic, have you? Got a load of old masters up there. They used to keep me after school, so I kept them after school. I wouldn't say my house is smelly, but it got turned down for a skunks' convention. (Robert laughing) (Dave mumbling) She worked for Right Guard. No, but seriously.

(audience laughing) (faint clapping) - Well, that was wonderful, really. The one about the pantry was about the best one, I thought. - The pantry? - No, no, not the pantry. The secondhand car salesman with the tax demand. (audience laughing) - I don't approve of cars, actually. I think they poison the air. - Well, they do. Yes. - That's why I'm a vegetarian. - Oh, yes? - There's so much pollution in the world! - Isn't there, yes? Bodily pollution. - Incredible, isn't it? - The world is just full - Yes. - Of pills and tablets-- - That's right. - And drugs! - That's right. - And women (exhales) just scrub floors! - Women.

Yes, yes, yes. I love a little wiggle to settle the digestion. -[Lorraine] Fine. - I used to dance at school, actually. But I gave up when we started using real women.
