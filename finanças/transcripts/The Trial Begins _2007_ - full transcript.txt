You forgot customs again, eh? Call the truck. Come in. It's you Costa, come on in. How did the Chinese go? Very well, Commander. I was just telling Prisco how well the week's gone. Good, excellent work. I hope I won't have to change my mind. I'll look over the reports of the previous inspections, we'll take it from there. You can go. Yes sir, Commander. Did you have a good trip? Yes, I'm a little tired. Let's go. Filippo, why can't I come to your house? I told you Mom, I've got workmen. I could make suggestions, especially for the kitchen. I want you to see it finished, you'll be pleased. Who'd ever have imagined, in such a short time you'd have a nice house in Rome, and a good career with the Finance Police. I'm proud of you, my son. As your father would be, if he were alive. By the way, I brought you orecchiette pasta, tarallucci, sun-dried tomatoes and this too. I had it printed special, if you like it, you can keep it. Dad was handsome, wasn't he? Remember? He was so good at his job too. Where do I sleep tonight? Sleep? I'm working tonight. What, you work even Saturdays? No Saturdays or Sundays in my job. The Commander believes in me, I can't disappoint him now. You're right, work is important. Do you have a girlfriend? Eh, girlfriend! Filippo dear, we all need someone, look at your Mom, all alone. I know, but then who'd think about work? Promise me you'll visit. I'm all alone in the village, Dad's gone, you too, what about me? I promise. All these months, you've never come. I'll come. - I promised you. - Thank you. Eat or it'll get cold. I finished the display. - I like those red boots. - Certainly, this way. Please sit down. - Do you want red or white? - Red. - What size? - 8. What are you doing here? I just wanted to see you. What nerve! - You're important to me. - Yeah, I saw. - Sleeping with that girl. - That was dumb-ass. Give me another chance, it was no big deal. No big deal? Don't touch me. Our story's over, because of you. Good. Very good. I'll be straight, you did a great job. Both of you. You're growing and in a short time, but we're in deep water again. When do I get the new reports? Prisco? They should be ready by the end of the week. - Afull week? - We've got lots of work. With a little effort they could be done by Wednesday. Mine, at least. Wednesday's perfect, good. You can go. What are you pulling? I've always been decent to you! Don't touch me, I'll report you. "First quarter: 5206949." Damn it! Had to happen today, didn't it? Have you got anyone in mind for this new mission? - I was thinking of Calasso. - No. - Why not? - I don't trust him. Who then? I thought maybe one of the new guys. Prisco and Costa? I don't think that's a good idea. I do though. Which of the two? I don't know, still have to decide. Come in. It's you, come in. - Is something the matter? - No. - We finished the work. - Already? Good. - Not because you rushed... - No. We did thorough research, it's all in order. I understood the urgency and wanted to help you. Are you ambitious, Costa? The right degree. So, you are. - You can go. - Thank you. Yes, Commander. I'm pleased, well done. Thank you. Mr. Donati is the company owner. To what do we owe yourvisit? - A simple inspection. - Anything we can do for you? - Coffee? - No, thank you, we're here to work. I see. Carla is at your disposal, call me if needed. Very good. Proceed with your work. Take a look. Get a load of him. That's not all, you've no idea what's here. Good, keep digging. Carla told me you've finished. May I? Nothing to say? What's there to say? You have to tell me something. Mr. Donati, there are fake invoices, illegal workers, ambiguous bank accounts. There aren't even grounds for appeal. Where do I get 350,000 euros this morning? You could have thought of that beforehand. That's Italy's biggest problem. Those who run a company always face three questions. Do I pay my taxes, pay my workers or do I shut down? I'm sorry, the Commander is waiting. Wait a minute. You can't ruin me like this! This was Dad's company, I've breathed dust for 20 years! Let me make a few calls, I'll get some money together. I don't even know where to pay taxes. I'll bring the money here and you tell me whatwe do. Please, help me. Your orders. How did it go? Very well, we found nothing of importance. Good, you can go. Thank you, have a good day. Come here. Stand at attention. I don't know what's in your head. I trusted you and you're betraying that trust. Recently, I've ignored the pay-offs taken by you and your team. I could have punished you, transferred you far away, to Sicily, Calabria, Sardinia, but I didn't. Do you know why? Because I keep thinking you're a valid element. But if I trust you, you mustn't betray me. Understand? So, can I trust you or not? Yes, Sir. I didn't hear you. Yes, Commander sir. Good. Hello. - Is Mr. Donati here? - Who do I say? Mr. Costa. Mr. Donati, Mr. Costa is here. Alright. 504, you can go right up. Do you have the new report? We indicated one small irregularity, so not to stand out. This isn't needed anymore, right? Leave as soon as possible. See you in the morning. Did you bring it? - I think I found it. - Good. Let me see. This should be the one. Let's see. Finance Police, here for an inspection, is the owner here? The time to make a call. What's going on? - It's just an inspection. - You could have called my accountant. Don't worry, please sit down. It's nice of you to offer a seat in my own home. Are you French? Look, I'm here to do a job, an inspection. Your assistant told me to speak to you, so I've been here waiting for you instead of going to the administrative office. I asked for documentation and received these 4 sheets which... Enjoying yourself? I'm glad. Are you touchy, can't take jokes? I'm here to work. May I have your name? Filippo... Madame. - What's yours, huh? - Catherine. It's a nice name. Isn't it too soon to be so casual with an older woman? You don't look so along in years. Would you rather I be more formal? I spoke to the Vedova Foundation for the exhibition and with the movers who'll pick up the collection in Bergamo. - Let's not waste too much time. - Don't worry. - There's a person here for you. - Who? A delivery for Francesca. That's me. It's me. I was thinking, why did I leave? Why didn't we sleep together tonight too? I don't know. Want to drive? So, what's so urgent? I want to know what you think of my project, I need your support. This thing is risky for both of us. You can't change your life from one day to the next. Why do it? You're making a career, a little money in your pocket and a lovely lady who cares for you and protects you. How do you know? Think I'd have involved you if I weren't sure of you? So, will you help me or not? To do something like this, you need a very influential person, able to help and protect you from the outside. Why are we here? Wait. Tell me! Wait and see. Are we celebrating something? So? I met with the Commander today. He'll allow me to leave the Finance Police. What's happening to me? - What? - I'm happy. I'd never have imagined to be so comfortable with a man, as I am with you. Maybe I shouldn't tell you this so explicitly, but it's the truth. I was happy with Adriano, then his illness came. They were very hard times for me. I thought my life was over. I didn't feel up to going back to Paris. It's incredible, but I never thought I'd become so close to you. I didn't have an easy life. It was one of sacrifices. I wanted a university degree, to do something important, but for my father, a simple Finance officer, there was just sacrifice and duty. Nothing else. I dreamed of doing something important. Now I think I can. I need you to make my dream come true. Will you help me? It's strange returning here. Since Adriano died, nothing's been touched. For a long time I couldn't come inside. I decided to sell it, but when I found a buyer I knew I shouldn't sell it. We can leave if you want. What do you say? Do you like it? Take a look around. - Will you help me? - Of course. Are you sure he'll be there? How many times you've asked me! - Does he have good memories of you? - Yes, excellent. He was fond of Adriano and even came to his funeral. Don't worry. What a pleasure! Good evening! This is the famous Filippo. A pleasure. May I speak informally, he could be my son. Please come in. Come with me, I'd like to introduce you. When will he get here? Learn to wait. Understand? Come on, let's enjoy the evening. - Good evening! - It's been so long! You're as beautiful and enchanting as always. Giorgio, may I present Filippo. Pleased to meet you. Does this boy realize his good fortune? I'd like to speak with you. Excuse me, I'll steal her for a moment. I've seen a beautiful painting, you should see it. I'd like you to see Filippo. No problem. Have him call me this week, now, back to the painting... The senator is expecting you, may I show you in? Thank you. - You may go now. - With your permission. Come in. - How are you? - Just fine. - I'm glad to hear it. - Have a seat. - How's Caterina? - Very well, thank you. - Give her my regards. - Of course. So, what do you have in mind? You may be aware, I'd like to get Adriano's company running again. I know. I'm drawing from people who have the experience I lack. I need a hand, someone who can help me get this project going. I was very fond of Adriano, but feelings aside, I recognized in him a great entrepreneurial capacity. My boy, that's a thing you either have or you don't. Believe me, I have a project, I'm not improvising. Give me the chance to show you. It was nice meeting a young man with clear-cut ideas. I'll see what I can do. I'd like you to know I feel, politically, very close to your party. I'd be pleased and honored to support you, both morally and materially. - Sir, Mr. Patrizi is here. - Good. - Nicola, hello. - Hi. - Nice here! - Like it? Have a seat. - I brought the list you wanted. - Good. These are companies I've inspected myself. The most interesting is a contracting and construction company that has built 50 apartments. It's rotten, the banks will be forcing closure in a month. - This one? - Yes. Listen, if we make them an offer now we'll pay 40% market price. - How much time do we have? - Not much. - Can I see it? - I'll set up an appointment. - Is it worth it? - It's a steal. I have to get back to headquarters. - How's the Commander? - Same as always. - Tell him I'll drop by. - Okay. - Don't forget, let me know. - Don't worry. The senator is waiting. Here's our Filippo. May I introduce President Rizzi. It's an honor to meet you. He's sharp, he's got great potential, we have a lot of faith in him. Good, enjoy the party. It was a pleasure. With your permission. Why don't you see him? You'd be doing me a favor. This is the project, with blueprints. The scale is one to a hundred, these are the floor plans... May I present Mr. Fiore, he was explaining the project. That's the building, 50 small-sized apartments. We've already sold 30, on the plans. It's an area in rapid expansion, a subway station will be nearby. We're evaluating the use of first-quality materials for the interiors. We believe solidly in this operation. Just a moment. I told you, it's a steal. The President is expecting you, this way please. Have a seat. How are you? Senator Bussi speaks highly of you. The senator is too kind. You're wrong, he's hard-put to compliments, so, if he speaks highly of you there's a reason. What can I do for you? - May I speak freely? - You must. Good. I've set up a contracting and construction firm. With this firm, I buy up companies on the verge of bankruptcy. You do? How? I have informers who like me. Who? Influential people who have faith in me. So, I can buy up companies at low market prices, even 40% less. Now there's a big opportunity, a building with 50 apartments. I have to move fast to get it, that's why I need preferred-client status with a bank. I've spoken to the senator about this project and he suggested I come to you. I'd like to establish this type of rapport with your bank. We're talking about very important business. I know, I'm young and seem inexperienced, but I'm enthusiastic and my back is covered. But you won't say by whom. Then you'll need other guarantees. My guarantee is this building. You know that, in case of consent, it will go down in writing? No problem. I'll think it over. - Could I leave you the project? - Please. I thank you very much. I'll await your call. You've been very kind. Nicola, it went well. You'll see, we'll get the loan. Tell the Commander. Now? I'm on my way to see my new home. Really? What's her name? Valentina! No, play with Valentina yourself. I'll let you know, remember to tell the Commander. Bye. I've waited an hour for you! Sorry, a hitch. Pleased to meet you. Lovely here. You like it? I'm glad. - Is it as lovely inside? - Let's hope so. Let's see it. What's the estimate? Sir, since you took over, we've never stopped but the change-over has caused deadline extensions. - We have to recoup. - It's impossible to go any faster. Then do the impossible! It's also a question of money, at this pace the men want a raise, they're protesting. We'll give bonuses but kick the protestors out. It's not so easy, there are Unions. I'll handle the Unions, that's not your problem. Kick the protestors out, understand? If you meet the deadlines, I'll give you an extra. Okay? It's a good deal. Make an offer, but I want a reply within the week. - Clear? - I'll call and let you know. Good. - Tell me. - I have another great deal. - I can't talk now. - Come as soon as you can. I'll work on it. Thank you. Stay with me tonight? You know I can't. To make the same mistake twice is really stupid. Sir, I'm leaving. Madame called again, I told her you'd just left, as you asked. See you tomorrow, goodbye. Good evening, sir, everything alright? Just fine. - She's upstairs. - Thank you. What's the matter? I can't take anymore. I can't take going on like this. Don't worry. I just need time. I'll take care of everything. You're hurting me too much. You're hurting me too much. Don't worry, give me time, I'll resolve everything. Just a little time. I have something for you. You startled me. Can't sleep? No, I was waiting for you. I'm sorry, I've been very busy. I can imagine. I'll join you in a minute. See what nice material? - Can we change the collars? - Why? They're fine like this. - You always win. - Of course! Matteo, let's take measurements. Chest, 39.4. Sleeve, 24.8. Now I'll give you the shoulder. Shoulder, 18.5. Did you get them right? Check them. I'll see you in a week. But no later. - Don't worry, good day. - Same to you, thank you. Chiara, I'm going to lunch, be back in an hour. You have an appointment. - Who with? - Mr. Donati. Who's he? Remember? He made the appointment a week ago. Come in. My compliments, a nice office. In the circles that count you're all the talk. If memory serves, it doesn't bother you. So? What do you have to say? Know what happened to me? The Finance Police are in my office again. You helped me once, I thought you might again. Now that you're so important maybe some friend, a phone call... I'm sorry, I no longer have connections with the Finance Police. You can tell. Know what my father used to say? If two people swim close together in rough water, when one of them can't stay afloat, for instinct, not for malice, he'll drag down the other. I don't understand. I'll explain better. Remember our encounter in the hotel? After coming to a civil agreement, you brought a new report and I brought the old one, which I tore up, as you told me. But a little voice told me: go back and get that report, get it back, it will be your life insurance. So I did. Today I have two reports, two amounts and just one signature. Yours. What would a judge say? How about it, will you help me? I understand what you're saying, but the sole truth is that you're not meeting your commitments. We've helped and encouraged you, but you don't keep your promises. - I ran into a few snags. - That's just words. What matters is, at this rate, we'll have to stop financing you. I'm very sorry, I'll try to meet commitments. It's best you do. Have there been any inspections recently? - No, none at all. - That's good. - But I have things to tell you. - What? I'm having trouble with logistics, I have no storage areas, no open area for unloading and the material for the interiors isn't the best. Meaning? It's material that reacts opposite to expectations, they'll freeze here in winter and boil in summer. So? Will you be living here? When do we finish? At least two months. You have just one, the banks will eat me alive! If not, I'll replace you, there's a line for your job. To be perfectly clear, I'm the one in charge here. What is it? I told you, I can't do a thing. Alright, let's meet. Where and when. I'll be there. Let's continue the rounds. What do you want from me? My father used to say: "be nice to those you meet on your way down, you'll meet them again coming up". I asked my ex-colleagues, your situation is irrecoverable. What, you? Now that you know so many important people! I was amazed seeing you at a party with politicians and contractors. If it's a question of money, I'll give it to you. - Give me the report back. - It's not the money. - It's the Finance Police. - I can't do a thing! Then I'm pulling you down with me. What do you want from me? Let go of me. Let go of me. You'll pay for this, you know? You'll pay a high price. Resolve my problem. Where are you? Nothing, I was thinking about you. I can't wait for this evening. I miss you. A kiss. - What's going on? - The Finance Police is here. - For an inspection. - What? You look pretty good. - How long has this been going on? - Quite a while. - Why didn't you tell me? - I wanted to resolve it myself. Did you? Tell me about it. This Donati muddles around a lot. - We helped him once, but he's back. - What did you do? I asked Patrizi to inspect him, but his situation is irrecoverable. I tried to tell him, but he insisted and I reacted, badly. What did he do? He sent me the Finance, Prisco came to my office! - What did Prisco find? - Everything's okay in the office. The rest is under dummy names. - Who else knows this thing? - No one, what can be done? Want to be thrown in jail? I'd rather retire. If he calls you, tell him you're doing your best and bide your time. Reassure him. From now on, you do what I tell you, if you want to talk to me, do it through others, never in person! If you do as I say, we'll reach the end of this thing. Alright. Are you disappointed? Not answering? Did you talk to her? When do you think you'll be moving out? I've been thinking and I'm a little sorry for her, but it's the right thing for everybody, isn't it? Francesca, I've been thinking too. I'm not up to it. To what? To changing things. Because it's okay this way. You're joking. Tell me you're joking. No. I knew it. I even said so. To make the same mistake twice is stupid, and I did. What changes? Everything, all of it! I never want to see you again. Here, you make me sick. Wait! What do you want? Wait. Will you leave her? Please, listen. I know I didn't do a very nice thing. I went through a rough time. I was wrong, I had a crush. When I realized I was about to lose you, I felt ill. Please, forgive me. I got this for you. Pretty, eh? Excuse me a moment. It's been squared. Okay, thank you. Who was it? Nothing important. I'll go take a shower. How about putting some champagne on ice? Adin? Madame? Prepare a bottle of champagne, please. Alright. translation Charlotte Lantery subtitles OMBRE ELETTRICHE - Roma extracted by rogard
