Over there... Help him! Mercy! Don't take your anger out on the little one Who are you then? - My name is Tao Wai - And I'm Peng. - I am the older, - And I the younger Do you understand? And what do you want from me? - We wanted to propose to you... - To forgive you - So better get out of here. - You don't know who I am... - Do you know him? - Never seen him before. My name is Yang Wai. And everyone knows that I'm the best. - But that's pretty arrogant. - And rude. - You are a whore - and have no manners. You think you are funny. Time for someone to shut your mouth. That's not how it works Thank you, thank you very much. Don't worry, old man. All right, that was nothing. I want to thank you It was a pleasure for us. We are happy if we can help. You are too modest. What is your fighting style actually called? I use the Yung Tung technique. And I like the 5 arms style. - Which is better? - Ours, of course! And which one do you think is better? His is the best. You know... your brother alone wouldn't have won You know... your brother alone wouldn't have won - What do you say? - The man is right... Without my help you would have been finished. What? You would be dead without my help! - Apologize immediately! - You should apologize! - I won't consider it. - You'll regret that! Come on! Gentlemen... stop arguing. Please make up again, It was just a misunderstanding Yung Tung fighting school My Yung Tung style is a variation of Shaolin Kung Fu. All well-known fighters agree it is the best technique available. Look here! Not only is it fast, it's also precise, And it's certainly better... than Peng's fighting style. This show-off... 5 Arms Style fighting school All masters agree that my technique is the best. So watch out! Dragon, snake, tiger, panther, crane, .. All of these are attack techniques My style combines them all, so you're almost invincible. Now I'll show you how you're superior to any enemy, Master, someone just delivered this Bring it inside. Yes. - Ching Tin, you take over here. - Yes Master, Alright, pay attention. - Ching Tin, come here! - Yes. Please take over, - What have you got? - Look here... We'll make a fortune! We'll be rich soon! This man has to be rich. He sent money and wrote... this is just a down payment. He has two sons. He wants me to train them. Dad, he won't spend so much money on that. It seems strange to me, please be careful. You don't understand. The rich don't know where to put their money. I know enough of them... Ching Tin, that bastard mustn't find out about this. What do you mean by that? The old fox must not hear of the letter. What old fox? Who are you talking about, Dad? You're stupid. Father, that's silly. You haven't seen Uncle Peng in a year.

With me your son will learn everything he needs in life. - I only need 1.5 years training. - Oh? Then all I need is 1 - 6 months. - Now wait... I want them to study for two years. Da Do, Cha Do... Don't make trouble for your masters. You have to be obedient and work hard. Who was that? Show yourself! It's getting late, time to get up. So it's Ching Tin, I was getting scared. What do you think of my one-finger stand? Not bad... who taught you that? I invented it myself. Not bad, right? You seem to be at least a grand master in lying. Stop kidding, who taught you this technique? Nobody, it's mine. Here, I'll show you! - Are you convinced? - I don't believe a word you say Master Ching. Take a look! Master Ching?! Master Ching? Where is he? Not here, but you're awake now. - Don't ever do that again! - Don't boast, Kung. I know that you are afraid of your master. Yes, I'm afraid of him. After all, he pays my wages.

Wait! Marketplace... Sister... - What is it? - I can't train with that. - Why not? - I don't like to train with men. I see no difference between male and female training partners. I have a different opinion. Men are way too rude. - It's not fun for me. - How do you imagine it? I... I thought you could train me. You're so pretty, it would definitely help me learn. That would surely be great fun. Okay. I will practice with you. Very good. It's a lot better, can you see I'm improving? Feel my heart! And my stomach. Also down here... - Did you like it? - Wonderful, keep going. Who are you? I did it! - Where did you get that? - From the big crane and you? Kung Fu Ching, such a thin guy. It's the same guy, we'll get him! - Yes, let's do it. - Not so fast, sit down and stay calm. Don't be reckless, let's think first. We can both take him on, attack from both sides. Afterwards we'll both have two black eyes. And it doesn't have to be that way. Excuse me, I would like to start a song. If you like it, applaud. If not, you can beat me up. Two crazy people in the bar with faces looking like black tar, Dishonest and deceptive, they sit there and scheme But they celebrate too soon, their plan is just a dream. - Does he mean us? - I think so. After. What are you doing? Can't you see I'm sleeping? I just told you I was sleeping. Get out of here! - Do you mean me? - Yes.. Hey, what's going on? Stop fighting! Are you crazy? It's him! - Come here, you crane. - You show off - I thought you were a kung fu master? - Unfortunately not today. - That was pretty good. - I just didn't want to show off. Hit him! Okay, that's enough. - Was that good? - Yes, great, - Kill them! - After you! - You first! - No, you go! - I don't want to - Will you do it? I'm not that tired of life. Why are you leaving? These cowardly dogs, You were very lucky, if I hadn't been here They would have beaten you up. I have to go, hope to see you soon. My rice sack. Where's my rice? Who stole my rice? Give it back to me or I'll get mad. He threw you out over a sack of rice?! That's unfair. - What do you want to do now? - I already have an idea - I will practice Kung fu. - What style? Both of your familiy styles. That won't work, when my father finds out he'll be furious. Why? Our fathers have been at odds for years. That's a problem. They argue about who has the better fighting style, you understand?! Just like eating. Some prefer chicken... Others prefer to eat fish. And some would prefer to only eat vegetables. I'm not that picky. I eat everything that is edible. The main thing is that I get fed. That is why I am so well built. I like your philosophy, I will eat everything too. Well, my son, have you familiarized yourself with our rules? Yes master, I have. Remember our number one rule, you must be obedient. If you break these rules, you will be expelled. I request that you follow these rules unconditionally. - I will, master - Your training starts tomorrow Thank you, - It's my master's favourite student - He is also the best in my class Hello brothers, come on in. Not so fast! Thanks for the invitation, but we have other plans - Let's have tea together? - You still owe us something. - Did you forget that? - We want to fight with you. - Do you want to hit each other? - Oh yeah! You wanna kill me? - Yes - You can't - Wanna bet? Do you believe us now? You won't beat me so easily After him Are you crazy?! You are really serious. This time it's your turn Come here! First the right arm. And then the left one. It's really dirty. Disgusting. - Don't be naughty. - You asked for it I'll show you. So, you coward. Now it's your turn. - Tie a knot! - All right - Do you see now? - We are the greatest Let's tie him up. Why don't you show this technique to our students too? We can't show our students everything, don't you understand?! Not bad. Really good. You have learned a lot. But you still have to work on your style. Thank you, we do our best That pleases me. I will soon give you the chance to prove your skills. - Thank you master - Thank you master This Kung Fu Ching worries us. He is studying under Wai and Peng at the same time. He could be a problem. When he's finished studying with both, he'll be invincible I'll take care of it. What's happening? Father... - Kung Fu Ching! - Master, - How long have you been with us? - For a year, master, - Do you think you've learned a lot? - I guess so. I'm delighted for you. You worked hard. Now show me what you can do. Master, do you want to test me? Yes, I want to know what you can do because you are my favorite student, as you know. Yes Master. I know you like me. - Is that all you've learned? - No. - What's this? - A claw... the snake claw. - Snake claw?! - I meant panther claw... Axis, panther claw, here you have it, Check out our commandments! You will be expelled! - Master, listen to me. - Yes? Kung Fu is like eating. Some like chicken, others duck or fish. Or meat... But I like every good meal. If it's edible. You take everything like a trash can. Get out of here, you're no longer my student You stuidied with my brother! - Yes, but... - You violated our laws. Have a sip first. Something wrong? - Do you need money? - No. - Trouble with women? - Also no - Are you sick? - Leave the nonsense... The two masters kicked me out because they cottoned on. That's all? So what's the problem? I'll teach you, I'm just as good. - Are you serious? - I never joke when it comes to fighting. Really?! I promise you to try my hardest. Is that exhausting... Hey are you crazy? Let me down again! And now the staff. Quite good. Once more. - That hurts. - Don't be so pathetic But... Stand up! You are too reckless. Try to use your head. Oh no, I never can Really good food. Are you hungry as well? I am too tired to eat. I want to sleep. What you lack is persistence. If you worked at it, you'd be a really good fighter. You're getting better. Jump up there! Now put the basket on the left. The other too. And now back again. Now on the other side Jump down! Come on! And up again Once again! Down again! And up again! And down again, go! Down... up! Down... up! I'm breaking my back here and he just falls asleep. - The food is ready. -Coming Damn it, was that you? Go back and run here - But it is far too slippy - If you don't run, you don't eat. What?! I'll show him. I can do it! - Hey, leave me something. - You just have to hurry. Sifu! - Sifu, I can't do it. - OK, come here. Come on, eat! If you crawl like a dog, you can eat like one. If you run, you can sit. Here you go. Whoever crawls like a dog has to eat like one. If you run, you can sit. Brother, I can do it now. So? Watch out, I'll show you - Can I finally eat now? - Help yourself What the hell? You've eaten everything. I am full. Are you finished? - Are you kidding? - Come on, clear the table! And next time you do something, don't make sich a fuss about it. - A good meal. - Damn it. Listen carefully to what I say. Don't miss anything. - Well. - Shaolin is the origin of Kung Fu. But there are many different styles. What did I say? Shaolin is the origin of Kung Fu. But there are many different styles. It is impossible to learn all styles. - Why are you hitting me? - Why don't you defend yourself? Even if you had the strength, will, and spirit, there wouldn't be enough time. Each style has its advantages and disadvantages, So it's up to us to find out which are the best And don't waste our time on the bad. - Not again. - What did I just say? - Good... and bad. - What is good and what is bad? Take the good and reject the bad. Take the good and reject the bad. Don't forget it, or you'll get into trouble. Keen eyes, good hearing, brisk attacks and quick movements... are the most important things in Kung fu. Keen eyes and good hearing are the most important... quick... quick... Fast movements! Why don't you fight back? You are my master, I don't dare. How are you going to learn without fighting? Forget I'm your master. - I can't. - You can't!? Then I'll do it! This is called cannon strike. - Master, you're serious? - Of course. OK, let's do it! It's called temptation. That is the setback. And take your chance. That was the wrong variant. - It's called illusion. - What's this called? Careful now It goes down... and up! This is called a feint What are you doing? Master... is that what you call a feint? - You learn quickly. - Of course, I have a good teacher It's Kung Fu Ching - He's looking for a beating. - Looks like it. Should we take him on? What did the fat guy say? I'm supposed to fight, that increases my stamina. Then I'll start today. - Hey, how are we today? - Nice day, isn't it? - Sorry - Are you crazy? - I'm sorry - Watch out, you jerk! We'll teach you manners! I think I'll teach you - Where did he get that from? - He must have trained in secret. Come on! - You should perform in the circus. - Just you wait. Here's something new. - You'll break my arms. - That's your problem. What is it? You look unwell. - Is he laughing at us? - What should I do? It's called precision. But I still have something... for the ears. - Nobody can stand this. - Just leave us in peace. If you run into me again, it won't end well. Take care! - You bastard! - Don't leave us like this! On... On... And up again... Again. Hey, we're being watched. Where did they come from? No matter. I'm going to give you a little lesson in Kung fu. The great Tao taught me a unique technique. I still haven't quite understood it, but it's still educational. If you apply his style, you are practically invincible. - This is fantastic. - Oh yeah. - They fell for it. - Show me. I want to be invincible. So listen carefully! We start with the one-line stand. Head up, back straight, put your hands on the floor and then your buttocks. And you need to take a deep breath during the exercise. Two-stroke stand, the stationary stand, even stand, hanging stand, the spear stand and the bolt stand. I know a lot about fighting techniques, But your one-line stand is new to me. Did you make it up? Definitely not. He got it from the great Tao. I heard it too. He says that it is invincible. The one-line stand, the stand on a line, This is awesome, let's try it. Get into the basic position. Head up and hands on the floor. Now wave your ass. You idiots. You let yourself be fooled. - But he was serious. - Yes it's true. Never try to trick me again. - But we... - That guy tricked us I have an idea... - The fat one over there. - Exactly, the fat rat. You can easily cope with him. Are you Tao Pao? That's me. And who are you? I am the invincible! Aren't you a little full of yourself? Nobody has defeated me yet, and I'll add you to the list. Be careful, it doesn't look harmless. All right, don't worry. I can crush something like that. Don't boast. You will see. - Sifu, let me do it. - Are you mad? He said he wanted to see me. So I have to receive him. - Let's go, - What can you do with that little stick? This is not a simple stick. If I fight with it, it gets longer. Longer and longer, but you will never see the full length. Alright, let's see it then. - What do you say now?! - I'm serious now. Good, me too. You will be amazed. Do you see how it grows?! I told you that when it fights it gets longer Thank you for keeping it going Unfortunately, I need my stick myself. Here, you have yours back. - Did he just run away? - I want to know who sent him. You idiots ridiculed me. You will regret that. - He wasn't so invincible - He's just an amateur, - Good day. - Hello Ching Tin. Your technique has improved a lot, Kung Fu Ching. I have the best teacher. - Are you keen on the little one? - But not... - Can I go? - Just this once, but don't exert yourself. Go on, have fun. - What are you doing here? - I'm preparing for Dad's birthday The day after tomorrow he will be 100 years old. I should get him something. - Is he still angry with me? - Of course - You know how stubborn he is. - Then he won't get anything from me. Now don't be so childish, after all, he taught you a lot. You will give him a good wine. From my private stock. - Sifu, that's so generous. - And I'll bill you for it later Master Tien, we have carried out your orders. The two will be there. Thank you for your efforts. Master Tien... Here Thank you very much. You rats, I'll keep my money, Welcome, friends, welcome... where are your sons? - The two are already waiting for you. - But where are they? They are with the devil What do you mean? I sent them to hell, and I haven't forgotten about you two. You beat up Yang Wai 3 years ago. He then went to Manchuria and has never returned. Yang Wai is my brother. I am here to avenge him. Da Do and Cha Do have spied for me. They were not my sons but my servants. And you want to kill us too?! I will punish you appropriately. You can fight together, as you did with my brother. I can do it alone! We will see. - Stop it! - Wait! He doesn't want us to help him. - Uncle! - Father! - Xiao Hei - Stop! - Ching Tin, are you hurt? - And now it is your turn! Father! Now it's your other leg's turn. Master! Kung Fu Ching! Speak! Where are Peng and Wai? - Open your mouth! - They''re out of town with Tien. Come on, bend down! Hands on the floor and wiggle your butt. And keep up the rhythm! Your time is up What happened to you? I wanted to punish the pigs. I wanted to avenge you. But this greenhorn killed me. - Who are you? - Me? None of your business. He is their student. Wai and Peng trained him So that's it. Then I'll start with you. You can experience what I have learned over the years before you die. Then I'll settle up with your teachers, Sounds interesting, hope you don't overdo it. - Sifu, help me! - What's happening? - Look! They want to kill me, you have to help me. You can do it alone. Give it a try! You keep out of it, fat bag. I especially like guys like you... Master, I can handle them. You heard him, not my fight Are you deaf?! I have nothing to do with it, he's your opponent, - I don't know what to do next. - Think of something. Hey, here I am! Now I think it's our turn. What's happening? Are you tired? Anyone home? - What are you going to do now? - Now I'm getting warmed up. Sifu! - Sifu, are you alright? - Everything is fine. Leave me alone. Get out of here, he's too good for us! It will all be over soon. You celebrated too soon. You are impressed? I warned you. Had enough yet? You have to work on your defense. You're not too bad. - Are you looking for me? - Exactly! My fist already found you! - It's over, little one. - You think so, grandpa? - So, should I let you go? - I can do it myself. Master, you are still alive, help me! Give me a trick to use! You got what you came for. Sifu! You're really dead... but I avenged you. I killed the pig, you should have seen it... I didn't make it easy for him. I showed him properly, the bastard. Now I'll light a candle for you... I hate candles!
