Like, it's coming! Come on, gang. Down here. Are you sure, Fred? It doesn't look very safe down there. It's gotta be better than what's out there. Where? Where? Where? Where? Out there. - No. - Werewolf. You guys hide in the alley. I'll go get help. It's a dead end. Or it's gonna be for us. Look! What are we going to do? What we always do, Daphne. Solve this mystery. Yes! Just as I thought. Old man Wither's son, young man Withers. - Of course. - Great job, Fred. Once again, you and the Mystery Machine have saved the day. But what about the other monsters? I think it's time to round 'em up. But first... Now, for a little Monster Mash. ♪ These are the good ol' days ♪ ♪ Any day when we're together ♪ ♪ These are the good ol' days ♪ ♪ A holiday Wouldn't feel any better ♪ ♪ Come on, one more time ♪ ♪ Save me, I'm unravelin' ♪ ♪ Find out what it all means ♪ ♪ This mystery ♪ ♪ These are the good ol' days ♪ ♪ Any day when we're together ♪ ♪ These are the good ol' days ♪ ♪ A holiday Wouldn't feel any better ♪ ♪ Ba-ba Ba-ba-ba-ba ♪ ♪ Ba-ba Ba-ba-ba-ba ♪ And now, for the unmasking. Of course, it's the whole Withers family. And we would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids. - Great going, Freddie. - We all did it together. We're awesome. And don't forget the Mystery Machine. Thank you. No! No! Freddie! Freddie! Mystery Machine! Where are you? Freddie, are you okay? Yeah. I... I must've dozed off. I had a terrible dream that I lost the Mystery Machine. Oh, man, what a nightmare. Um, Freddie. The Mystery Machine is gone. Ah, that's right. I sold it. Don't worry, Fred. You aren't the only one depressed about Mystery Inc. closing up shop. I've got an entire section on my Big Blog of Mysteries called Unsolved Capers. And I guess, now, they'll forever remain unsolved. Which, to be honest, makes me a little crazy. - You have a blog? - Yes. Which you know, because you've all subscribed, right? Listen, I know things haven't been the same since the sheriff lectured us about staying out of trouble. Uh, of course, some things haven't changed at all. Forty-one, 42. Forty-two sandwiches. I bet I can eat 'em in 42 seconds. Forty-one. Well, I don't know about you guys. But I'm itching to solve a mystery. But we don't have a mystery to solve. Maybe we solved them all. Eye-witnesses report a mysterious, ghost-like creature that floated through the scene, promising horrible doom and destruction to all onlookers. They say the vegetable cannery's haunted by a laughing green gargantuan. That's true. Every night the ancient ghost materializes and asks passers-by how to program a VCR. - What's a VCR? - I don't know. Well, gang, looks like we've got an embarrassment of riches. Nope. No, siree. The sheriff told us to stay out of trouble. From now on, the only mystery I care about is how to get the rest of the ketchup out of this bottle. Yeah. - Ketchup. - But Shaggy... No buts. We've been to every haunted house, park and carnival north, south, east and west of the Mississippi. - Plus the Mississippi. - Oh, yeah, the Riverboat Wraith. Well, we've had it up to here. I guess we have used you as live bait a few times. A few times, daily. Well, maybe you do deserve a break. Okay, Shaggy and Scooby, you've made your point. No more mysteries. Ah-ah-ah-ah, we've heard that before. We're gonna need more than that. Raise your right hands and swear. - That's a menu. - Oh, they know. Repeat after me. We, like, solemnly swear, to, like, not solve any more mysteries, man. We, like, solemnly swear, to, like, not solve any more mysteries, man. And a promise is like a promise that can't be unpromised unless the promiser, gets permission from the promisee. You dig? And a promise is like a promise that can't be unpromised unless the promiser... Uh... Yeah. Court adjourned. All right. It's official. Mystery Inc. is closed for business. Good. Best to leave the mystery solving for the professionals. You guys have been running around, looking for trouble for so long, you've forgotten how to just be kids. Opening lemonade stands, playing kick the can, talent shows in the barns, sock hops, potato sack races, eh? He's not wrong. - About the sock hops? - About everything. What you need to do is treat yourself to a vacation. Get away from the city. Go have some fun. You know, that sounds like a great idea. Maybe it'll take my mind off of her. - Seconded. - Where could we go? Oh, I know. Maybe an amusement park. No! No way, no how. No amusement parks that ended up being haunted. Or zoos with demon animals. - No... - Opera phantoms. Right. In fact, no theaters with phantoms of any kind. We're gonna stay right here and watch our favorite show on that TV. Hello, sweeties. It's me, Elvira. Your spook-tacular hostess with the mostest. Back with more cinematic turkeys that really put the horrible in horror. I never understood why you two chickens love watching these terrible movies. Because these cheesy monsters are the only kind that Scoob and I aren't afraid of. Cheese. Okay, before we start tonight's monstrous marathon of mediocre movies, I got a spine-tingling treat for you. My spine's tingling already. An anonymous sponsor has offered to provide my most fang-tastic fan an all expense-paid vacation to a tropical paradise. Hey! An island retreat sounds fun. It sure does. Like, nothing bad's ever happened in paradise. I'd wish you good fortune, but you're already out 'cause I've seen our next movie, Predator Jones. It'll take your breath away. If you're lucky. Drum roll, please. Ladies and gentlemen, my agent. Uh, where was I? Oh, right. The hapless rube... Uh, I mean, vacation winner is... Is the suspense killing you? Con-bat-ulations to... Shaggy Rogers. Shaggy is allowed to bring up to three guests along with him. And one pet. Pet? Really? Uh... Oh, that's what it says here, folks. All right, after the break, I'll answer your questions. See you soon, sweeties. We're going on vacation! We're going on vacation! Huh. That's awfully convenient. I... Uh, no. Never mind. We promised not to look for another mystery and I keep my promises. I choose to believe it is in no way mysterious. Yeah, I guess you're right. I wonder when we get to go. No mystery there. Like, right now. Yeah, now. Man, I could get used to island life. How about you, Scoob? Yeah, it's the best. Yep. It sure is nice out here on the open sea. No mysteries, no worries. What? Ah! It's not there. There is absolutely nothing mysterious going on. Nothing. Whew. Yeah, you promised the sheriff, not to mention Shaggy and Scooby. Hey, Fred, what are you doing? Me? Uh, nothing. Not thinking about the stuff that I promised not to think about. You? You guys good? Don't worry, Fred. We get it. It's hard to think about anything but solving mysteries. Why, I was about to try and solve the mystery of how all these trees in this tropical paradise don't look tropical at all. But then I reminded her that we promised Scooby and Shaggy we wouldn't solve any mysteries. Big or small. I mean, look how happy they are. I know. Why don't we ask the ferry captain how long before we reach the island? Then all we'll need to worry about is how much fun we're having. Great idea. Excuse me, Captain. Where did you say this island was that we're going to? The darkest reaches of Davy Jones's Locker, if you ask me. Oh-kay. And I thought I was having a bad day. You seem scared, sir. Are you all right? I'm past scared or all right. Tomorrow is my last trip to the island on account of... the zombies. Gee... If I cared about solving mysteries, I might be thinking about that other time we went to an island filled with zombies. It's too bad I'm no longer using my Big Blog of Mysteries. Why one might find such information about that encounter on the "unsolved" page. But, of course, there's no need to do that. I'm sure when the captain refers to zombies, he's just using slang. He's probably just talking about them. I think we may have reached our sausage limit for the day. I agree. We're here. But mind you, I'll be returning tomorrow for the last time. Just before the sun sets low. You'd be wise to be back aboard. Or else... Or else we'll have way too much fun. Am I right, gang? Thanks for the ride. See, it actually does look tropical. No need to worry at all. And look, native islanders. I bet they're here to give us a real island greeting. Hi, I'm Fred. And, uh... Get out. Hmm, that's odd. Did he just say to get out? I choose to believe that it's some sort of island greeting, - like aloha. - Gotcha. Get out to you too. Get out. Yes. Get out, everyone. Oh, so friendly. I just love island life. Get out. Thanks. That's what we're trying to do. Get out and get to relaxing. Yeah, uh, get to relaxing. Get out. You must go before it's too late. The island is infested with zombies. And if you don't leave, you could become one too. Did you say zombies? Well, then if I was a person that was curious about such phenomena I'd probably want to investigate that. But since I'm not, I guess I'll, uh... I'll just go now. Tourists. This is a terrible van. I'm just saying as vans go, this one's pretty basic. One color, no flower decals, no name written on the side, I mean... What's it even called? The van. Mmm-hmm. Hmm. Boy, can those two relax. Yeah, I guess small talk isn't our thing, is it? Usually we're trying to figure out how to escape some monster or who did what, where. We've never really just sat around and talked. Well, maybe we should start. Who saw the big game last night? So, Velma, uh, what's your favorite thing to do besides solving mysteries? There is nothing else. Scooby, how are you, buddy? Look out! - That's weird. - What, Velma? It looks as though someone deliberately cut this tree down and pushed it into the road. And from the looks of it, it seems like they used something sharp. Like a claw. Hmm? Uh, like something we don't have to worry about. Absolutely. I mean, trees fall all the time. Even trees made out of... - Plastic? - Listen! Dudes, I know there's mysterious stuff around every corner, but you promised. You're right, Shaggy. And we are going to keep our promise no matter what. Right, gang? Right. No matter what. Right. No matter what. Good. Now, how about we get back to that vacation? Anybody else hear that? Sorry, that's my phone. Anyway, looks like something's slashed my van's tire. - Good. - What? Uh... Nothing. Eh, probably some sharp rocks. - Or claws. I mean, a nail. - Mmm-hmm. Hmm. Right. Nothing out of the ordinary. I guess we'll just have to hike the rest of the way. Ah! What a great way to start a vacation. Right, gang? Yes. This is really going great. Moonstar Island Resort? Haven't we stayed here before? I'm sure it's just part of a chain. I think Daphne's thinking of Moonscar. The island we visited with the zombies. And the cat people. And danger. The island that's clearly not this one. Say, are you guys suggesting that there's something mysterious going on here? - No. - Not at all. - She was just, uh... - Reminiscing. Yeah, about that summer when I was working at that TV station for my school project. Like, yeah, we know. I was determined to find an actual supernatural case not just another guy in a mask. Uh-huh. We searched everywhere, including Moonscar Island. Like, we know all this. There we met a series of very unusual people. Lena, Simone, Jacques, and who could forget Snakebite Scrubbs. Not us. 'Cause, like, we were there. We arrived at a house that looked a lot like this hotel. But then we were attacked by zombies. But we found out that the zombies were actually victims of the cat people. who had been draining innocent bystanders of their life force in order to stay alive for over 200 years. Right. The cat people were originally villagers who survived the pirate Morgan Moonscar when he landed on the island to bury his treasure. The villagers had called upon their cat-god or something to get revenge. So he changed them into werecats. Werecats. They were going to steal our life-force, too. Something they could only do during the harvest moon. But we were able to stop them and they melted into nothing. You know, I was never really satisfied with how that whole thing turned out. Since we're back, we could break this thing wide open. Break? As in break a promise? Besides, this says Moonstar. Not Moonscar. Plus, did you see the palm trees and the sand? The only thing we have to do on this island, man, is relax. It's beautiful. Thank you. It's my pride and joy. And you are? I'm Shaggy Rogers, the contest winner. Shaggy Rogers? Wonderful name. I'm Alan, the hotel manager. We've been expecting you. Welcome to Moonstar Island Resort. Why don't you sign our guest book, while I check you in. Happily. Hmm. I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for the guestbook pages being ripped out. Isn't there, Alan? Moths. Now, if you'll follow me, here at Moonstar, we take pride in our luxury accommodations, and the safety of our guests. As you can see, we have the highest security standards to make sure you have a pleasant stay. Wow. That's a lot of cameras. Only for your protection, I assure you. Why would we need protection? Gee, Fred, it sounds like you're asking about something mysterious. You wouldn't be doing that, now, would you? No, Shaggy, not at all. Just curious. This is my wonderful staff. The finest of the fine. The cream of the crop, as they say. That's Jack, Linda, Mona and Bugbite Stubbs. They'll be here to help you, should the need arise. Why, those names don't sound at all like the other names from the other island adventure that we're not talking about. Well, when you hear something suspicious, I guess the best thing to do is ignore it. Huh? Everyone seems so... Attractive? Yes, well, that's because we have... standards. But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and you are the sun. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Oh! Nice to meet you too. Say, you wouldn't happen to have a place to eat around here, would you? All this excitement has me and my buddy famished. Yes, and it's all free. Free? Yes, and we serve only the finest of fine cuisine. Including... an unlimited supply of gold wrapped Scooby snacks. Am I in heaven? Yes, and heaven is just offstage right. All you can eat. We'll take that as a challenge. - Right, Scooby-Doo? - Challenge accepted. Now, are there any questions, concerns? - Ow! - I don't know, Daphne, any concerns? Maybe about what might be on the island? Something lurking in the shadows? But we are not worried. Not even a little bit curious about what the ferry captain told us on the way here. And what is that? Oh, he mentioned something about the island being filled with zombies. We mustn't talk about that. It is the island's, uh, greatest mystery. Mystery. Which means... Maybe we should, uh, join the guys for some food. Oh, boy. I think I hurt my neck on that last go-around on the buffet. Well, might I suggest a nice, relaxing massage? Yes, you might. I'm up for anything nice and relaxing. Me too. Excellent. We've got a five star masseuse, who will work any knots out of your food-laden bodies. Uh, shiatsu? No, Great Dane. This bathrobe is the comfiest thing I have ever felt. What do you think, Scoob? Uh-huh. Wow. This is nice. I can feel the years of fear and anxiety floating away already. Look, Scooby-Doo, our masseuses are here. It's time to loosen up the old muscles. Oh, fabo. I know, not much to look at. You really have your work cut out for you, huh? Wow! Your hands are really cold, dude. Ooh, freezing. Scooby, I know that the gang is having a hard time not jumping at shadows and solving mysteries, but I think it's for the best. Maybe... Aah! They should get a massage, too. Ow! A little softer, would you? I have really sensitive skin due to over nutrition. Not me. Dig in. Ow! Just a little lighter, please. I'm extremely fragile. Zombies! Zombies? And over here, we have our shuffleboard room, pool room, and finally, garage. Jeepers. You sure have thought of everything. Yes, and we have so much more in store. No, it couldn't be. Sure sounds like her, but it's not. It just can't be. All right, hold on, Fred. Don't open that door. You promised. Huh? Are you all right? Massage. Attack. Cold hands. I'm afraid your friend must have hurt himself during the fall. I can't understand a word he's saying. No. They're saying that during their massage, two zombies appeared and attacked them with cold hands. How could you possibly know that? Oh, I'm fluent in panic-Shaggy and Scooby. Zombies? Then the legend is true. We've... Got a case of someone who has an overactive imagination. - Huh? - Huh? You heard the part about the zombie, right? Of course, but as a woman of science, I know there is no such thing as... "zombies." There isn't? No, of course not. So it stands to reason that what you saw wasn't a zombie at all. But what else could it have been? Well, since it was at the spa, I can only assume it was probably other guests with mud masks on. Mud masks? Really? It does make more sense than flesh-eating, undead monsters. Mm-hmm. Ugh. Daphne's right, it was probably nothing. I mean, if there was a real zombie lurking around, Scooby and Shaggy would be nowhere near... Hey! Where's Scooby and Shaggy? Like, I know where this is going, buddy. First, there's nothing and then... There's something. Exactly. I say we hide out here. And only venture out to grab some food. Speaking of which, I've got my emergency hiding snack satchel for just such an occasion. Good thinking, Shaggy. I know. Like, no one will ever find us down here. Ow! Oh? Hey! Haven't we been here before? Hmm? Cat people. Cat people? But that doesn't make any sense. We're on a completely different island. Huh? Scooby-Doo, please tell me that's your stomach. Uh-uh. Not again. Scooby? Shaggy? How long are we going to keep this promise to not solve any mysteries? I mean, there's a lot of strange things happening around here. And I'm dying to figure out what is going on. Bad choice of words. You're choosing words and I'm barely keeping it together over here. I mean, did you see the way the staff reacted to the word "zombie"? I know. But we can't let Scooby and Shaggy down. They've followed us through a million mysteries. The least we can do is stick our heads in the sand and avoid this one. I know you're right, but it's so hard. Maybe after we find Scooby and Shaggy we can occupy our minds with something else. Like shuffleboard or whatever you're supposed to do on vacation. Sounds like a plan, Velma. Scooby! Shaggy! Scoob! Shaggy! Huh? Find anything, Freddie? Nothing. She's not out there at all. It's just a trick of the light. - She? - Uh, I mean they. They're not out there. Did I say she? That's weird. But, no, not like, this is a mystery weird. That should do it. What's gotten into you two? Like, what we've been saying. Zombies. They're everywhere. Zombies? We must run. Hide. Boys. We've already been through this. There's no proof that zombies are haunting the island. Let's be reasonable. It's coming from outside. Do those look like mud masks? Kind of. What are we going to do? We're doomed. Uh... Let me try that again. What are we going to do? We're doomed! So much better. I'm sorry, I must have fainted. What are we going to do? I was wondering if there was any dessert or... Dessert? At a time like this? There's a horde of zombies outside this hotel and you want to eat chocolate pudding? Chocolate pudding? That sounds great. - I'll take one. - Me too. How can you think of eating at a time like this? Yeah. Don't think... do. - We don't even have pudding. - We brought our own. Regardless, the zombies are gonna be here any second. Or, maybe minute. Half hour, tops. Aren't you professional mystery-solvers? Can't you solve the mystery that's happening right outside? We'd really, really love to help. But we promised Scooby and Shaggy that we wouldn't solve any more mysteries. And a promise is a promise is a promise. Remember, guys? I mean, uh, the only thing that could break a promise is the person that they promised the promise to saying that they could break the promise. I get it. I don't. That's right. The people that made us promise just have to say it's okay for us to break that promise. What? Who cares about promises? There are zombies outside. We care. We made Shaggy and Scooby a promise and we're gonna stand by it. Oh! We hereby exercise the takesies-baksies clause to release you of the promise to stop solving mysteries. - Oh, thank you, guys. - Oh, finally. Wonderful. Now, the zombies! First things first, we need to secure the perimeter. - I'll get the doors and windows. - And Fred... I know. It's trap time. Lucky for us, zombies aren't the fastest movers in the world. Um, should we be worried? Negative. Everything is going exactly to plan. - It's quiet. - Maybe they're sleeping. I get sleepy when I eat turkey. Maybe they ate some turkey brains? Oh, no! They're all pushing on the front door. Right where we want them. Now, Fred! You did it. I can't believe that worked. Say, do you smell something? Mm. Smells like barbeque. Fire! What's happening to the zombies? They're... They're melting. Uh-huh. Just as I thought. These aren't zombies. They're witches. 'Cause melting. No? Nobody else? Okay. Jack is a zombie? He's not the only one. Mona? Linda? I'm aghast. Aghast, I tell you. No, Alan, I don't think you are. What do you mean, Velma? It should be obvious. Would you like to start us off, Daphne? My pleasure. It first started when Shaggy and Scooby won that contest. It was way too coincidental, and in fact, was probably planned. And then the trees leading up to the island, looked like they'd be more at home in a swamp than in a tropical paradise. But there are palm trees on this island. How do you explain that? Plastic palm trees. And then, remember when we arrived? and Mona couldn't help telling Shaggy and Scooby, "Yes, and..." That's an improv technique taught in acting classes. Yes, and... she also told them the buffet was stage right. Which is also a theater term. That's right. And when Jack quoted Shakespeare to Daphne it was from one of the most common monologues used for theater auditions. But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? Plus everyone was way too good-looking. The men have perfect jaws, the girls perfect hair. It's almost too perfect. And don't forget the cameras. That's right. There were cameras all over the hotel. And the most important clue. The guest book. There were pages ripped out of it. Pages that had the signatures of previous guests, including us. Uh-huh. This isn't a tropical island at all. This is Moonscar Island. Or as I called it in my blog, Zombie Island. But the name of the hotel, it's totally different. Not exactly. They changed one letter and they didn't even do that very well. So what does that all mean? Isn't it obvious? That this isn't just a hotel, this is a location, and we are in... A movie. Cut, cut, cut, cut! You ruined everything. Everything. Thanks? Thank you. You're right, Velma. This is a movie. And I'm not just Alan, the hotel manager, I'm Alan, the film director. Alan Smithee? Sure. And this was to be my greatest masterpiece. Something that felt true, that felt real. But now, it's ruined. Forever. But why us? Well, as you know, the only thing studios care about these days are franchises, like those found-footage horror movies that spawn a bazillion sequels. So I thought I could do my own. In my research for the next big thing, I happened upon your website, the Big Blog of Mysteries. We have a blog? What? As I was saying... There is a section called Unsolved Capers. The most popular part, if I don't mind saying so. And in it, it has all this stuff about a reluctant werewolf, and the tale of Zombie Island. But Zombie Island wasn't unsolved. The cat people disintegrated while the zombies went back to an eternal rest. There is nothing about what you just said that sounds solved. But you only used the zombies. What about the cat people? Cat people, werewolves... Those costumes are too expensive. Zombies, however, are as cheap as a bucket of plastic prosthetic makeup. So I decided to make a movie. But first I had to figure out how to get you back to the island. I'd read about Shaggy and Scooby's love of TV's Elvira. The horror hostess with the mostest. And since all Hollywood weirdos know each other, I called her up and asked her to help sell the whole vacation getaway ruse. You're the anonymous sponsor. Guilty as charged. Then I needed to introduce the zombies in a way that would put the audience on edge, but not convince you guys of the coming threat. So you cut the tree down to block our way here. And slash the tour van's tires. Uh, no, actually. I don't know what that was. Another mystery. Maybe, just maybe an unsolved one. Uh, yeah, well... The first time I had the zombies attack, was at the spa. But I was hoping to have a sequence of being chased by the zombies, maybe a grand finale involving the hotel. But no, you figured a way to trap my zombies before I could finish. I would've gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids and your incredible talent for solving mysteries. Months of research down the drain, I even found this weird little pendant on the island I thought was a good omen that the movie was going to happen. Simone's pendant? Fat lot of good that did me. Well, it wasn't very nice. You had us all pretty worried that something nefarious was going on. Yeah, and come to find out the only thing nefarious was you. I'm sorry. I truly am. I thought with your amazing performances, your good looks... Well... I suppose so. ...and comedic timing... All right! High five. ...it really was going to be an amazing movie. But now, I'll never be able to finish the film. Oh, no. Don't cry, Alan. I mean, what you did was wrong, but we can still do the movie. We can? Of course, we can. How hard can it be? Memorize a few lines here, look scared there. - Uh, you mean it? - Why not? We are supposed to be having fun, after all. And that will give me time to finally figure out the "white whale" of Unsolved Capers. The mystery of Zombie Island. Then, ladies and gentlemen, let's make a movie. Few tears gets them every time. Hollywood. In this scene, you discover the treasure of Morgan Moonscar and must open it, in order to return the evil zombie spirits back from whence they came. That's not how the story goes. The zombies were just victims of the cat-people. Hello? "Based" on a true story. Uh, is it just me, or now that Velma can solve mysteries again she's, sort of, looking for one everywhere? One time, I swore off gluten for a year, and after that, I ate more gluten in a day than I had my entire life! I think this is like that. What's "gluten"? Now, it's cold out. You're wet and shivering. But we're not... wet. Action! It's her! She's back! Oh, I've missed you so much! Mm. I can't believe it. I can't believe it's you, where have you been? Freddie, are you okay? Uh, Fred, that's not the real Mystery Machine. You don't know. Maybe she got stronger, and broke out to find me! Afraid not, Fred. Fred, gang, meet Seaver. He's our stuntman. Howdy. Seaver had this beautiful piece of machinery built for the climax of the film. We're gonna jump this thing over the hotel while being chased by a zombie hoard! Whoa! Yep! I've been driving it back and forth over the island since we came in on that ferry yesterday. The ferry? Ha! I thought I was hallucinating! Why didn't you tell us? Because of the promise. I was so desperate to solve a mystery, I started thinking I was just making one up! I almost thought I was going crazy! But now that I know I'm not going crazy... can I drive it? No, you may not. It takes a trained professional to drive this thing. But... you can ride shotgun while I park it in the ferry overnight. Cool! I'll let you boys handle that while we head to our next scene. What's our next scene? Oh, you'll see. And, action! I'm hungry. Nah, no, no, no. Scooby, no. The line is "I'm scared." Try it again. I'm hungry. No, no, Scoobs. It's "I'm scared." The line is "I'm scared." I'm... hungry. It's not "I'm hungry," It's "I'm sca..." What? Uh-huh. Okay, Scooby, you know what? I just found out... there's no more food. I repeat, there is no more food. I'm... scared! Perfect! All right, Seaver. Just run straight through the glass. This action camera will capture everything in perfect high definition. Fred, what do you think you're doing? I appreciate Seaver and all, but I don't need a stuntman. I can do my own stunts. I'm a man of action, after all. No, Fred, you're a man with an ascot. There's a huge difference. Listen, I really appreciate your commitment to the role, Fred. But, what would happen if you got hurt, huh? You're one of the stars. If you couldn't continue, the movie would be over. I guess you're right. I... I am pretty important. Of course I'm right. I'm Alan Smithee. Have you seen how many movies I've done? - No. - Well, it's a lot. There's a whole bunch of them. You have to trust me, Fred. You ready, Seaver? And, action! - Oh! - Fred, don't! Ugh! Ugh! Missed it. Oh. Medic! Boss, we have a problem. What kind of problem? Ahhh! Like, I think we had a wardrobe malfunction. Wardrobe! We're going to need bigger pants. In this scene, the zombies have you cornered. All you need to do is stand there and look scared. Let's practice. Okay. Look scared. Yeah, sure. I'll fix it in post. Places, everyone! Action! Look out! Oh! Alan, are you all right? Uh, yeah. But, what happened? It looks like someone deliberately cut the rope. But, why? And is that... cat hair? The palm tree. Simone's pendant. This is it, Velma! One of the unsolved capers! It's happening. I have to go! Fred, I don't think she's okay. We've got bigger problems, Daphne. It looks like we have another mystery on our hands! Uh, could you say that again? Maybe with a little more oomph? Um, sure. Well, gang... Hold on, hold on, I'm not ready. Okay, I'm good. In three, two, one. Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands. Cut! That was great. Really great. Next scene. Ugh! Velma, Velma! Are you okay? I'm better than okay. I'm finally going to get to the bottom of the Zombie Island Mystery! But we already have! It was just a movie Alan wanted us to be in. Keep up, Blake. Not that Zombie Island. The other one. The one where the cat-people appeared and tried to suck our life-force! There is no way they were real! It defies the laws of science. But it was, Velma! We were there! No. It's got to be something else. Something rational. And now that they're back, this is my chance to find out what is really going on or my name isn't Velma Garbo. Your name is Velma Dinkley. Not since I became a movie star. Velma! Wait, the cat people are back? I know you're out there. Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty. Okay, this is the last shot of the day. The magic hour! We'll start up the weather machine and have the zombies attack. All you have to do is run the other way, okay? Run, run! Run! Shaggy! It's just a cat, Scoob. Nothing to be worried about. Like, nevermind! Whoa! I know I should be freaking out, but this is adding some serious production value to the picture! Ahhh! Stay back. Ugh, stay back! I'm allergic! Sorry, boss. We quit. What? Come back, you can't just leave! What about the art? What about sacrifice? We can't keep this up. Are those cats? No. Those are... cat-people! Uh-oh. We have to get out of here. No! We have to finish the film! The film? We're being attacked by immortal cat-people and you're worried about the film? Who cares? There's gotta be a way off this island! The ferry. Yes. I'll meet you there. He's right. The last ferry leaves at dusk. If we hurry, we can get on it, and get off the island! Come on! Alan? Oh, no! What did you do? We can't leave. Not until we finish this movie. We have to finish! Alan's lost it. And we've lost our only way off this island. No! I won't lose another one. Not again. Not this time. Not this time! Fred, don't! Well, I'll be! Maybe he'll be a stuntman yet! Don't worry, baby. Freddie's here. I don't see him! Everyone, get in the Mystery Machine. Hurry! Don't worry about me. Someone grab a camera and film this! Freddie, do something! Why would the cat-people need Simone's pendant? Why, indeed. Hmm. Like, they're gaining on us! Uh-oh, what was that? Bad luck. Real bad luck! Ahhh! Look out! Thanks. Fred, "U" turn. Now! Ugh! Ugh! Ahhh! What now? There's only one way out of this, Fred. Do you think I can? I know you can. Freddie, what are you doing? Hold on, gang. Oh, I need an exterior shot. - Whoa! - Yikes! Ahhh! Yes! That was amazing! Let's do it again. Way to go, Fred! You were both fast and furious, and thanks to my high-flying drone, we got the whole thing for the movie! I think there are bigger things to worry about than the movie. Look! Hurry, everyone!

For the discerning immortal Cat Person, we have the finest fish caught within the surrounding swamps. Please take a seat. A wonderful treat for you to eat. Bon appetit. It rhymes. Blech! Like, what kind of cat doesn't like fish? Looks like they're on a roll. Where did you come from? Come on, guys. What do we do now? They'll be after us in no time. We need a good place to hide. Why is everyone looking at us? How rude. Because, you two are the best hiders we know. Good point. I think we know just the place. Everyone in, quick! Are we sure about this? Sure enough. Where are we? I remember this. This is where the Cat People tried to siphon our life force, the last time we were here. But, we stopped them, remember? Maybe these are... relatives? Maybe, maybe not. Nothing ever felt right about our previous adventure but I could never figure out why. Hey, Scoobs. Move around here, get some footage. You okay, Scoob? Yeah. Now, why is there a hole in the middle of this cave? Why are there holes everywhere? It looks like someone's been digging for something. Maybe the Cat People needed a litter box. They must be looking for Moonscar's lost treasure. But, why would mystical immortal creatures need a treasure? My question, exactly. Look at this. It's the moondial. The Cat People were waiting for the harvest moon to rise in order to steal our life force. That's weird. The cat symbol on the moondial looks just like Alan's pendant. That's all well and good but if the Cat People are real, then the rest of the legend is true too. If we don't get out of here, we're dead, or at least undead which also sounds pretty bad. Hmm. I think I figured out what's going on with the Cat People and more importantly, I think I know how to stop them. But it's too late, the harvest moon has risen. That means we're all going to turn into zombies. This once, I think you're right. Brain. I need brain. No, stay back. Stop. We didn't know the curse was real. It wasn't even my idea. As I suspected. The greeters and the ferry captain from when we first arrived on the island. What? You're not zombies at all. And, you aren't soul sucking Cat People. Bravo! Bravo! I really couldn't ask for a better performance. That was amazing. I didn't know you had it in you. But how? Well, it was easy, really. After we found out they were making the movie, I figured whoever was trying to sabotage the film must be doing it for a reason. When we saw the holes in the cavern and the pedestal, it all made sense. Someone from the island must be looking for Moonscar's treasure. And who were the only people that were on the island but not part of the movie? These three. But, how did you know they'd be frightened by the zombies? Well, if they were so convinced that Moonscar's treasure existed, which of course it doesn't, they must on some level believe in the curse. So, we left a pendant to draw them further into the crypt. And dressed as zombies to scare them into my trap. Which totally worked by the way. But, the gold? Good old gold foil wrapped Scooby Snacks courtesy of Alan Smithee productions. There are still a few things I don't understand. Just a few? Yeah, like how did they control the cats? With this. The four of them used a cat whistle to guide them into doing their bidding. Four? There's only three of us. Like, no way! There's the scary black cat, the one that punctured the roof of the Mystery Machine. That attacked us in the hallway. Scooby, tight close-up. This big, right here. Maybe, just maybe, there really is an immortal Cat Person left on the island. Maybe you didn't stop them all the last time you were here. Maybe, they still exist. Roaming the island for their next victim. Save that tape. That was money. Mmm-hmm. I know what you're thinking. I'm not saying that because based on a true story will sell more tickets. Yeah, you're right. That's exactly what I'm saying and it's gonna go right under the title. And, here are your escorts right on time. We would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you... - you... - Meddling whippersnappers. And don't forget talented film director, Alan Smithee. We haven't forgotten. You'll get yours, Smithee. I'm sure I will. But not before you. Have fun serving 15 to eternity in prison, lady. Ugh, and I got so close to finishing this film. All I needed was a boffo finale. At least, you gave it a try, Alan. Tickles! Would you look at that? I wonder what they are doing. The legend stated that the cats were the guardians of Moonscar's treasure. Maybe... Oh! Could it be? Oh, boy! It's gold! I can't believe it. I'm rich! Like, really, really rich. With all that gold, you can make a sequel or maybe a trilogy. Yeah, a trilogy. Are you kidding me? After this flick, I'm done with the movie business. But I thought directing was your dream? I've got a new dream. One involving retirement on a tropical island where no one gives you notes, and bets your future on a weekend box office. It's been a pleasure working with you kids, it really has, but I'm retired. What a vacation, huh, gang? Maybe the best vacation ever. How so, Velma? I finally get to cross off one of my unsolved capers. Unsolved? But, the Cat People from last time... ...must be the same people looking for the treasure this time. And the original zombies? Swamp gas. I think it's best to let her have this one, Fred. Point is, we can't stop solving crimes because we might get hurt or step on some toes. It is in our blood. It is our destiny. You know, Velma's right. We should never have made you guys promise to not be who you are. Yeah. Besides, without burning off calories running from monsters, I think I gained a whole pound. Who knew being afraid was such good exercise. So what do you say, gang? Mystery Inc. forever? Freddie? Of course, I'm in. But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna need the real Mystery Machine. Ah! I should have never sold it in the first place. And we'll do whatever we can to get it back. Mm-hmm. Then... Mystery Inc. forever! Oh, I can't believe it! Sheriff, what are you doing here? When I heard about some teenagers and a dog getting into a mess with some crooks dressed up as cats, I thought I'd come take a look-see. Turns out, I was right. You kids are solving mysteries again, aren't you? I thought we'd agreed you weren't gonna do that anymore. But, Sheriff... We just have to solve mysteries. It's the only thing we're good at. Why won't you let us be who we were meant to be? You know, you don't need to cry, Daphne. I'm sure you can do something else. But there is nothing else. It's our life's work. Uh... Well I guess if you have to. Thanks, Sheriff. And a few tears gets 'em every time. Well, since I can't talk you out of it, all I can do is tell you to be careful. There are a lot of people out there that won't take too kindly to you meddling in their business. Understood. Thanks, Sheriff. All right, then. Why don't I give you a lift home? Maybe in a little bit. Like, being a zombie works up an appetite. It sure does. Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Hello, my little freaks. Welcome back to the show. Next up, we have a zombie flick that's sure to make you meow for more. Hold onto your tails as we watch, "Zombie Teenagers and The Island of Doom." Ugh, seriously? I mean, that's the title? Right. On an island surrounded by water... A group of gullible teenagers will face a terror that isn't human. And... action! - I'm hungry. - Cut! I'm hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. Hungry. I'm... hungry. Cut! Action! Cut! Ugh, Fred, not again. - Action! - Like, listen. I know there's mysterious stuff around every... Cut, cut! You ruined everything. Everything! Zoinks! Uh-oh.
