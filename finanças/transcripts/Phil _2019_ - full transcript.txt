It's KPJZ Portland, radio for your soul. 9:57. Looks like we got more rain this week, followed by a nasty storm movin' in Thursday. You got any plans out there? Here's what I'm gonna do. Build a nice fire, grab a book, a hot latte, stay inside. Maybe you should do the same.

Bro, are you seein' this shit? Come on, man, you can do this. Brah, I can make you famous on YouTube, man, come on! We can go viral with this bitch. - Come on, man. - Do it! Jump! Jump, you pussy! Come on, do it! Come on. Let's go. - Boo! - Very disappointed in you, sir. You suck! Watch out, you jerk off! Come on, man. You call me, you say you need to talk, then you don't. If I wanted to drink in silence, I could have stayed home with Wendy. I just needed a friend. I'm not your friend. I'm your brother. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Is it about the divorce? - Malcolm. - What? You laughed when I said "marriage insurance," but that was a fully binding and comprehensive policy. Do you remember that song, "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden"? For real? It goes, "I beg your pardon, "I never promised you a rose garden-- I need another drink. "Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', there has to be a little rain sometime." Remember that? I've never heard of that song. Sorry. It's not the song, it's what the song's about. - Thank you. - How we expect to get this rose garden, but instead, all we get is the rain. Mm-hm. Rain's good for gardens, actually. But it's not the gardens that get the rain-- - Unless it's excessive-- - Don't you see it's us getting rained on instead of getting our garden. You see? - Not really. - Malcolm, do you see? What? It's-- It's a metaphor? Yes! Exactly. For-- For what our lives are supposed to be, which is alive and full and free, versus what they actually are, which is just... cold and drenched. Everybody's got a river of crap that they gotta wade through, man. That's not true. That is not true! - There are these other people-- - Hey. Keep it down. These-- These very few other people who have these amazing lives, they get their gardens. And it never rains. Never! Okay. Okay. Listen, maybe the people who get their gardens are there to give us hope. I mean, think about it. You gotta have something to look at, there's got-- there's gotta be a model out there where you can look and say, "Look how wonderful and beautiful that is." I think it can be inspiring to watch these people in their joyful, beatific lives. You need to feed off that energy, man. It's chicken soup for your soul, buddy. Good morning, Dr. McGuire. Good morning, Rahel. Did you do something different to your hair? - No. - Looks really good. Your 8 a.m. is prepped and ready to go. Dr. McGuire, uh, Doug's still in Hawaii, but his office sent over a referral for a quick check up. He's already been cleaned. - I thought it was lunch. - It's not. It's 10:35 in the morning. All right. Send him in, please. Thank you. Thank you again. Oh, my God, are you kidding me? This-- It-- It surpasses my wildest expectations, and you know I never could have finished this damn thing without you. Yeah, love you, too. Okay. Bye. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, nice to meet you, Dr. McGuire. - Oh! - I'm Michael Fisk. Fisk. Yeah, yeah, we met at Dr., uh, Cooper's office - a few years ago. - Oh, I'm sorry, you're-- you're much better with names than I am. - Uh, have a seat there. - Cool. - Get you started. - Oh, wow. Ha! Yeah. Sounds to me like, uh-- like you got some pretty good news there, huh? This is unbelievable. I-- I wrote a book, this historic tome, and people are buying it. - Hm. - It's getting traction. I'm stunned! Huh. Well, I wish I had studied more history myself. Yeah, me too. As my wife Alicia says, what the hell does a comparative lit professor know about the musings of Socrates? But then I say to her, what is a beautiful housewife doing playing cello in the City Symphony, so... Is that the Greek National team I see there on your shirt? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. I spent a year studying in Athens. Uh, I had this friend, he took me to every single match. Spiros, uh-- See if you can remember this name. Papalapadopulu. Hm. Can you do it? Try it. Papalapadopulu? Papalapadopulu. Hm. Yeah. Polioreya, yeah. That's very good. Yeah, I had a grandfather who was half Greek, so I spent a couple of summers over there. Ah, wonderful. Have you been back? No. No, I've always wanted to take my daughter, but it just-- it's never-- No, no, no, hang on, hang on. That's-- That's no excuse. Socrates said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." All of those times you almost did something, it's time you're never gonna get back. Hm. Suction. Yeah. I'll shut up. I'm sorry. - No. - I've been rambling on and on. - Oh, no, no, it's fine. - Uh, my daughter is back from Princeton this weekend just this morning. I said the day she graduates college is the last day Daddy's allowed to pontificate. How am I lookin'? Oh, yeah, you're... perfect. Do yourself a favor. Take your daughter to Greece. Hm. Great to see ya. Thanks for fitting me in. Dad. - Dad. - Hm? Is it okay if I stay at Mom's again this weekend? I have a paper I really need to finish. Yeah. Is-- Is it my apartment? because, you know, I've told you it-- that's a temporary situation. It's been over a year. I'm sorry. I just have trouble concentrating at your place. No, I understand. It's actually, uh, a little, uh-- Thanks. Noisy, I know. It's, uh-- Sure. - Maybe next week. - Yeah. How's school? Fine. Fine... how? I don't know. Just fine. Uh, did you wash your hands? - So glad that we had-- - Thanks, Dad. Rosemary, what's wrong? How do you think Molly's doing? Fine. Did she mention she's trying out for the lead in the school musical? No, but I-- I think that's great. Not if she doesn't make it, it's not. What makes you think she's not gonna make it? Well, for one, Phil, she's never sung in public before. And two, they're doing "The Pirates of Penzance." I mean, can you really see Molly as a happy-go-lucky singing pirate? Well, what do you suggest? Well, I suggest that we sign her up for singing lessons, pronto, and that you pay half. Half. Please don't slam-- Ooh. - Hi! - Hi. - Oh, thanks. - Yes. - How are you? - Mr. Fisk. Could you show Mr. and Mrs. Fisk to their table? - Over here, guys. - All right. This is perfect. Thank you so much. Hey, look at her. She's a woman. Oh, I missed you guys. So much. We love you, honey. Okay. Whoa, I'm dizzy. Yeah. Should I do it in reverse? - No. Turn around. - I-- I want it to work. - Okay. - Close your eyes. - Okay, we're gonna be okay. - Was it a good one? Yeah, we're gonna be okay. What was it? What did you wish for? It's gonna work. Oh, I know it's gonna work this time. I think you're right. Yeah. Ah! Sorry. Okay. Uh, it's probably from not brushing with an up and down motion. Oh... - We talked about that. - Mm-hm. Goodnight, Dr. McGuire. Guess who's learning to rollerblade this weekend. Who? I'm so excited. Do you have any plans? You know, it's probably not my place, doctor, but maybe you should just try to, I don't know, maybe find a passion. Something you can really focus on. It works for me. My life coach says all the answers are out there in the world, and you just have to open your eyes. - Hi. - Hey, baby. Be right in. I love you, you idiot. Hey, Mrs. Nolan, how are ya? How's Jack feelin', any better? Yep, he's out cheatin' at golf again. Yeah, well, I won't tell anyone. - I promise. - Thank you. Okay. Good to see you. Ring those up for you, sir? Uh, yeah, thanks. Okay. Huh? Are you kidding me? Michael. Michael Fisk? What are you doing in these-- these woods? Me? Oh, I-- Just-- I just come here to clear my head. Get some fresh air. Check out the greeness, the-- It's just so pleasant out here. Ow. Hello. Dr. McGuire. So sorry to be a nag, uh, but Mrs. Piccolo still needs her abscess drained, and the swelling's getting quite noticeable, and I told her that you would do it. Rahel-- I'm not feeling well. Uh, I think we may have to, uh... reschedule. Reschedule? Great idea. He was a wonderful husband, father, teacher. And such a wonderful friend to all of us. Which is why-- why it's so inexplicable that-- It's all right. It's been a difficult day for all of us. Now as our service comes to a close, let me remind you that there will be a reception taking place immediately following at Alicia Fisk's home. Now, let us pray. Our Father who art in heaven... - Hi. Hi. - Oh, dear. It was a lovely service. Thank you so much. It means the world to us that you came. Thank you. I guarantee we'll have a football franchise in Portland in three years. I mean, L.A. has football. Can you believe that? Football in L.A. Can I help you? Um, I'm looking for a report on the death of Michael Fisk. F-I-S-K. Your name? It that really necessary? Oh. Um... my name's-- My name is Spiros. Spiros. Spiros Papalapadopulu. Have a seat, it'll take a few minutes. Spiros. Spiros! Investigation's still pending. So I can only provide you with a standard incident report. That'll be $23.80, uh, Spiros. Yeah. You know you're wasting your time, right? I mean, these cases don't have any answers. Ever. Why? You had the perfect plan, Princeton daughter, Cartier house, and the perfect-- Wife and-- You had it all! You had your garden. You-- You're a garden getter. Now look at ya. You got a bunch of... dirt all over ya. So what would Socrates say now, Michael Fisk? What would he say? You're the one with the unexamined life, not me! Why'd you do it? Tell me why you did it. You didn't even have a reason. Did you? Did you have a reason? Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Hello? Alicia. That's right. Who are you? Uh... I'm sorry? Uh, just-- Um... How do you know my name? - I don't. - You just said "Alicia." - No. - And why are you... sleeping on my husband's grave? Is this like some pervert thing? 'Cause I've had a really shitty week. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, tell me who you are. Right now. Fine! I'm calling the police. And for your information, I happen to have, somewhere in here, a canister of mace. No. Alicia, Alicia. Stop saying my name! Who the hell are you? 911. State your emergency. Yes, I'm at the Crossroads Cemetery, - and there's a man here-- - Spiros. Ma'am? Hello? Spiros. Spiros? From Greece? Yeah. Spiros. I don't believe it. Spiros Papado-- - Spiros. Papalapadopulu. - Whatever. - How did you-- - Ma'am? - Do you need assistance? - Papalapadopulu. Oh! Uh, no. Um, I-- I'm so sorry. Uh, uh, it's the wrong number. You came all this way for Michael? That is possibly the... most beautiful thing I've ever-- Oh... Thank you. Thank you. God! My goodness, you're drenched. Um... - storm. - Yes, the storm, of course. Well, let's get you warmed up, okay? Uh-huh. Okay. Come with me, my car is right up here. Michael spoke of you so often. I can't believe it's really you. Is me. You're amazing to come all this way. Are you here alone? Do you have a wife? Uh, it's-- Michael always said marriage wouldn't work for you. It's true. You warming up? Michael loved those days in Greece, Spiros. We were planning a trip there next year, and he was determined to track you down. Honestly, I was sometimes, I don't know, a little jealous. He was always telling such great stories, like-- like the time that, um-- you two hitchhiked to, uh-- Where was it? Where was it? - Oh-- - To-- To Sweden. And, uh, with that, um-- With that drunken wrestling team? Oh, God. - Ooh. - What else? Uh... Oh, watching the sunrise from the Acropolis. Michael said of all the sights in all the world, that moment when the... sunlight crested over the Mediterranean was... was just that... Was perhaps time I-- I-- None of his friends can even talk about it, you know, it's like they just sort of disappeared, like Michael was never here to begin with. Uh-- One moment. Shit. Just grab yourself some more coffee. I'll be right back. Hello. Hi, Joe. Hi, yeah, no. No, sure, I get it. Okay, yeah. Sure. That was a plumbing contractor. On top of everything, I've gotta find someone to finish the bathroom remodeling Michael started before-- I wanted Kara to finish her first year at school, and Michael would have wanted that too, but... I don't know. Having a bunch of strangers alone in here is just-- Ugh! Well, perhaps I help? So Michael wanted to start from scratch, and-- and really do things right. You know? Well, this is it. Um, so, um, these are the plans that he drew up. Uh-huh. Well, is, um... uh, shower, the tile. Sink. This, um-- This may be a little more than I can actually-- Oh, God, I didn't want-- I didn't want to cry. His death was so sudden and unbelievable. And sometimes it's hard to just breathe. I keep wanting to turn to Michael for help, but, of course, that's impossible. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - No, no, no. I'm so grateful to you. Sorry, um... what were you saying? I start tomorrow. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, that's wonderful. Thank you so much. It-- It doesn't seem like a big job to you? No, no, it just-- This is smaller than I thought. - Really? - Yes. Great. So, I begin with the words. - Aunt. - Aunt. - Spitting image. - Spitting image. - Mayonnaise. - Mayonnaise. - Theater. - Theater. - Alabama. - Alabama. And then I move on to the questions. What do you say to address a group of people? Hey, guys. No, sir, we talked about this. You need to wait your turn. Okay? Please sit down. Please sit down. Thank you. Wait your turn. Dr. McGuire, where are you? It's me, Rahel, uh, we really need to talk. People are having den-- People are having dental issues, and I don't know what to do, so please, if-- if you could please call me back, sir. Thank you. Well, here we are. Thanks again, Spiros. Is there anything I can get for you, - or help you with-- - No, no, no, no, I be fine all alone. I-- We have old saying in Greece. What does that mean? Much joy in work. - Oh. - Yeah. Opa! Opa. Don't say opa. Ohh! This is why he killed himself. Alicia. Kara. Family. Perfect. Hello, Phil. It's your brother Malcolm. Pick up the phone. I know you're watching "Jeopardy" right now, so pick up, okay? Troy or Desiree? Okay, if I get the next answer right, you have to pick up the phone. The Greek God or Goddess of thunder, lightning, and knocking up mortal females. - Who is Apollo? - Desiree. - Who is Zeus. - Yes. Fuck! Call me back. - Yasso. - Hey. - You okay? - Yes. Yes. - Let me help. - Oh, no, I got it. How's the bathroom coming? Ready to catch the next flight back to Athens? No, no, is-is, uh... very good. - It's coming along. - It's-- - Great. - Yes. Got you a couple presents. Our local music store has an international section. Not many bazouki lovers here, so-- It's stupid. You can throw it out. No, no, this is, uh-- this is wonderful. My-- My mother, uh, teach me to dance to this. You dance? - Mm-hm. - Wow! And I know you love these. Turkish cigarettes. Yes! Oh! Michael told me you were a fiend. Yes. Bing. You remember Spiros from Greece? Do you remember Michael's dad? I-- I will get the other bags. Mm. There are no other bags. Who are you? Eimai Spiros. Spiros. He's not Spiros. - You're not Spiros. - Yeah, is me. Spiros Papalapadopulu? Papalapadopulu. I don't think so. I think you're Spiros Malaka Papalapadopulu. Malaka. Did I say it wrong? - Malaka. - Malaka. - Malaka. - Malaka. - Yeah, malaka. - Malaka. - Malaka! - Malaka. Honey, this kid's a full deviant, he taught me every foul word in Greek. - Yeah. - Yes, you son of a pousti. - Poustis. - Oh! Hey! Oh! - Oh! - Oh, God, Jesus, what a good time we had on that weekend. What-- What was that, 20 years ago? Yes. You cut off all your hair. I barely recognize you. Hey, hey. You remember this? Oh! Hey, you got-- Oh! You know, I'll bet Michael has some pictures from those days. Yeah. I think I know where they are. - Uh, is not necessary. - No, no, it's easy, they're right here. Come outside, we'll sneak one of these together. Yeah. You all right? - You all right? - Yes. It's just-- Good Turk is so sweet, tobacco is very nice. Why do you suppose a guy walks away from all this good fortune? Huh? It wasn't like he didn't know what he had, he did, he always talked about how lucky he was. Wasn't supposed to be like this. People slipping me books on how to properly grieve. I guess I'm not very good at it. Doesn't mean I didn't love my son. Of course. Of course you love him. Guys, I can't find those pictures anywhere, but Bing, come on, it's time to go. Here. Does he seem okay to you? Yes. Yeah? He had a cancer scare last year. Michael was worried sick. Okay. So, see you tomorrow. - Yes. - Sure? - Mm. - Okay. Um, okay. Dad, come on! We're late. You remember this old thing? Mike said he wore it every day of his life over there. I gave it to him just before he went to Athens. I'm sure he'd want you to have it. Please. And thank you. For being here. For helping Alicia. Alicia. Spiros. I-- I be there, uh, 20 minutes or so. Yes. I-- I get espresso. Maybe I-- I get you something? A tall latte? And no foam, yes. Okay. Yes, I-- The wallpaper's very nice. I-- I get you, uh-- My favorite color is Baby Blue Eyes. Yes. Okay. Goodbye. Hey. How's it going? Oh, super. How's it going with you, Captain? It's not what it looks like. Good, 'cause it looks like you just got off a fuckin' ferry boat. You're gonna have to pay in U.S. dollars, you know. They don't accept drachma here anymore. - I can explain it. - Excuse me. You look like a sheep herder. Please, tell me that you're playing Fagan in the Portland Playhouse production of "Oliver." Because if not, I recommend you get some serious professional help. - I can explain. - Of course. Alicia is wait for coffee. I'm worried about you. I promise I'm gonna tell you everything soon. Let's do it now. How about now? Is that good? Okay. Fu-- I have a job that I have to go to, and I think you do, too. But you and me, we're gonna need to deal with this shit. Understand? Okay. Wait. No. There it is! - Heading out? - Oh! You surprised me. What are those? Uh, these are the plumbing, uh, manual of the, uh-- the thingamajig. You're okay? Mm? Oh, yeah, I-- I'm fine. I'm just-- Been a long day. Ah. Mm. Very well, I will see you in the morning then. Oh, no. No, I'm afraid not, I-- Somebody called from the university, I have to, um, go in and clear out Michael's office. Oh. Well, that is, uh-- uh, most shitty. Excuse my language. No. You're right. It is. Most shitty. But, um, the department's short on space, and most of Michael's papers are there, so... Sam's meeting me at 9:00. Sam? Michael's tenured partner from the school. - Partner? - Yes. Michael and Sam worked together for years. They were very close. - Very close. - Yes. Something wrong? You keep repeating everything I say. Repeat-- No, no, I just-- Is, uh-- with the language. Uh, very well. I will go with you, help pack-- - No, Spiros. - Nai. No, I'm-- You're already doing so much. No, please, is-- is absolute pleasure. I mean, uh-- not pleasure. It is I-I'm happy to-- Uh, not happy, but... I will do it. As dean of this college, I've made it my life's work to pursue reason and understanding, but this thing with Michael-- it makes no sense. No, I know. Look, Alicia... I know how difficult all this is for you. All that I ask is that you let me be a friend. Oh, God. - Well-- - I forgot how much stuff there was. Such is the life of an academic. You know what? I-- I can help you with this. There's a lot to be done. I can move some things around, - and-- - I think we be okay. Eh? No, I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. Oh, this is Michael's friend Spiros. Oh, Spiros! Uh, uh-- The shower plug is broken so-- So now is the hour to dance? I-- I don't even think that's-- Hello, Alicia. Hello, Sam. I'll let you ladies catch up. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Are you? - Yes. - I'll be right-- - Thank you. Thank you, Jerome. It's nice to see you. I know it's been a while. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it has, I-- I was surprised we didn't see you at Michael's funeral. Uh, yeah, I was in Maine at a conference. Look, Alicia, I know that you're upset. I don't blame you. I am, too. Maybe even a little bit angry that he could do this. Oh, God. I just keeping thinking that maybe there's something I could have done. - No. - He was always so strong, and he was always positive. No. No. No. There was nothing you could do. So sorry. Oh, God! Oh, this is pathetic, I'm so sorry. Your having to comfort me. - No. - I'm so sorry. How are you? How are you holding up? Uh... some days are better than others. - There's so much to do here. - Yeah. How can I help? Yeah, this Samantha, she seems, uh, quite upset. Yeah, yeah. Well, maybe she should be. Why? She and Michael were both up for the job of department chair. I always thought she was a little sweaty about winning the job. I guess she outmaneuvered my husband. Of course. Man loses his job to woman, becomes, uh, ...despondent. No, no, not at all. Michael won the job, but in the 11th hour, he gave it to Sam. I never understood it. Wait, wait, wait. He-- He turns this job down? Yeah. Yep. He said-- Are you ready for this? Life's too short. Come on. Let's get in the car, it's cold. Who kills himself after getting the job? You designed these? - Mm. - You have excellent taste, Mr. Fisk. - Thank you. - Nora. Nora. We actually have a similar pair in stock. You wouldn't be interested in purchasing another set. Well, I actually might. I dug around my wife's jewelry box, and I can't find 'em anymore, so-- Oh, well, women lose jewelry all the time. Uh-huh. Right. Shall I put those on hold then? Yeah. Hi, this is Dr. Phil McGuire. Please leave a message. Hi, Dad. I just got out of my first singing class. It went really well. Uh, Mom's gonna drop me off at the diner, so I'll see you there. Okay, bye. How's your singing lessons coming? Do you like your teacher? She's fine. Where'd you get this? Oh, it was under the bed. It's hard auditioning, right? Why? Well, just-- Only one person gets the job. Well, what about the understudy? Yeah, well, two, but still it's-- The rest don't. You don't think I'll get it. No. No, no, no, I-- I'm not-- I'm not saying that, I just-- I just don't want you to be disappointed if you don't. So, to reduce my risk of being disappointed later, I should anticipate being disappointed now? Doesn't that guarantee I'm going to be disappointed at some point no matter what? - Um-- - Yeah. I know. I'll go wash my hands. Hey! Oh. Hello, Spiros. Uh, is Alicia here? Uh, she's not, um-- - She's here. - Jerome. Oh, hello, Alicia. I tried you earlier, but there was no answer. Michael's case is being looked into by the police department. Don't be alarmed. It's standard protocol. Chancellor Schmidt has seen to it that you are assigned the best detective in the city. I just wanted to make the introduction. - This is Tom Welling. - Mrs. Fisk, very sorry for your loss. Please, come in. Both of you. Oh, thank you. I still don't understand what-- What's there to investigate? Well, as a matter of course, we investigate all suspicious deaths, including suicide. Suspicious? Yes, according to the coroner, the initial report stated that, uh-- Just ignore me. I-- I am having a backwater flow in the sink. That's fine, Spiros. Go ahead, detective. The coroner said the cause of death was asphyxiation by hanging. There were no signs of struggle or force. Also found in Mr. Fisk's car were the receipts for the rope, and for the wine that he consumed before the-- the incident. Both consistent with suicidal intent. One other thing of note: he was barefoot, which, in and of itself, that's not unusual. What is unusual is that, uh... we did not find his shoes or socks at the scene. Why would that be? At this point, we're just not sure. Is it possible that someone just happened by and took them? Without reporting the suicide? What kind of person would do that? One more thing, Mrs. Fisk-- What about why? Excuse me? Why he do it? Why he take his own life? Yes. What about why? Well, without a note, it's hard to say. My investigation did uncover one potential lead. It seems that prior to Mr. Fisk's death, he may have been stalked. Stalked? Neighbors noticed someone watching the house the day that he died. Unfortunately, no one was able to get close enough to give a description, although a few did get a look at the car. It was just a standard sedan, dark, you know, thousands like it on the roads. You know, now that you mention it, that night at the mall, the night before, I do remember the strangest feeling, like we were being watched. Nobody in particular? No, I'm sorry, I'll-- I'll keep trying. Okay, that'd be good. Thank you. Spiros. Did you turn off the pressure control valve under the sink? Yeah, yeah. Mm-hm. Huh. I don't think you can turn it off. One more thing, Mrs. Fisk. These are your husband's personal affects. They're yours now, so, thank you, and again, we're extremely sorry for your loss. Thank you for your time. Gotta end. This has got to end. Alicia. - What I do? - Yeah, hi, Spiros. I'm sorry for calling so late. I-- I just needed to talk to someone. About Michael. I checked with the bank, but no-- no big withdrawals. His investments are solid, he had a physical four months ago, the doctor said his health was near perfect. He wasn't a drinker, he wasn't a gambler, he was-- people admired him. That's the word they'd use. Admire. And I did, too, I-- You know, he had his faults, he could be picky and demanding and a little-- a little distant, a little not there, but we were happy. Well, listen, maybe there's a-- Look, there is no answer. Everyone loved the guy-- family, co-workers-- he had no enemies, just friends. The man who has everything, huh? Well, maybe that was the problem. Maybe there's more to life than everything, and maybe he only realized that... once he had it all. Hmm. Well-- Despair can find any man. No, not you. You're too... Greek. Well, then... is good to be Greek. Yes. It's good to be Greek. - Nai. - Yeah. Opa! - You can do this. - What? This is your thing, you can-- - Your mother! - My mother? She taught you to dance. Come on, for me. - Hey. Excuse me. - No. Alicia. Over here my-- My friend, he's from Greece, - he can dance. - No, no! Yes. He just came over. - He's a dancer? - Yes, he's a dancer. - From Greece. - No, Alicia, no, no, no. I'm sorry. No, no, no. Whoa! He's Greek! Hey! There you go! Go, Spiros! Huh? Woo! Opa! Opa! Opa! Hey, Mal, what's up? Uh, wrong number. I'm looking for Spiros. I-- I know how crazy all that must look. Listen, I-- I can explain. I'm all ears. This is freaking me out. I watch a lot of "Nightline," I watch a lot of "Dateline." I'm worried about your mind. Like, this is some serial killer... type stuff here. How long you been doin' this? - A month. - A month? And you also remodeled your apartment, and, um... you're-- you're growing... olives? I'm kind of impressed. How's your, uh-- How's your dental practice? I don't really know. Are you-- You don't know? Hey, Malcolm, I'm just saying, I'm very close to solving this. Okay, when you say stuff like that, - you sound crazy. - You're the one who told me that Michael Fisk must have a reason. Right. Right, right, right, right. Yeah, um, because you don't want there to not be a reason because then that might give you a reason to do something that you actually don't want to do. Bingo! I couldn't have said it better myself. Want a little baklava? It's homemade. - No! - It's very good. And no, I don't get it. What do you think's gonna happen if you figure out why? You think all of a sudden your life's gonna get good, and awesome and normal? Look around, man. You don't even have a big screen anymore. How do you watch "Jeopardy"? This whole big search of yours to find a reason has led to you living a lie. And this poor woman-- She just wants the truth. Okay, come on. Let's do it. Finally, I'm allowed back in my own bathroom. - All right, all right. - Okay. Ready. Come on, now. Can I do it? I don't think you're ready. I am ready. I couldn't be more ready. It's-- Perfect. It's perfect. What are you doing here? It's not your night with Molly. Can I talk to her? Have you been smoking? Please, Rosemary? I just want a minute. Dad? - Hi, honey. - Hi. Honey, I was wrong to question your auditioning for the lead in the high school play. I think it's great that you put yourself out there, and that you went for it, and I wish I had done more of that myself when I was your age, and I just wanted to say good luck. I already auditioned. - Oh. - Two days ago. I didn't get the part. Oh... I'm sorry. They put me in the chorus instead. The chorus? Well, that's good. How do you feel about it? Fine. Fine. What? Did you think I'd have some kind of breakdown if I didn't get it? No, no, no. No, I-- Maybe a little-- little bit. I'm a pretty level-headed kid, Dad. That's the way you guys raised me. And besides, there's always next year. Right? Right. Yeah. Sorry. I have to go do my homework. Okay. Okay. Hey, Spiros, is this a bad time? No. No, no, no. No, no, no, this is-- No problem. What I do? I'm calling about this annual event at Michael's school. Um, honestly, I'd rather not go, um, but Kara's coming home for a few days on break, and she thinks her dad would have wanted us to go, and so we're going, and I thought maybe you'd like to join us. Uh, I, um-- I'm sorry. I-- I just haven't been out in public, and-- Never mind. Why am I even telling you that? No, no, no, no, no, no. Alicia, I-- And actually, I am, uh-- I am happy to join you. Drink up, Spiros. Free booze. Look at you. Hey, all gussied up. Let me guess. The Zorba collection? Let me, uh, ask a question. Hm? Why is it you no like me? Because I don't trust you. I knew Michael well. Whatever this friendship is that you're trying to cash in on with this widow took place a long time ago. Why didn't he ever tell me about it? I don't know. Maybe because-- and forgive my English here-- you are fuck face. Hey. Thank you. To porcelain and pop up drains. You're having good time, yes? - No. - Oh... No, not at all. No, it's-- It's kind of hard work being the suicide widow. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, sweetie. - How are you doing? - Good. - Did you eat something? - No, I'm good. - You sure? - Yeah. Good evening, everyone. I just wanted to welcome you all back to our-- our little tradition here. I look around, I see old faces, some new faces. And some old faces that are now new faces. No, it's-- it's great to have you all here, I especially want to welcome... Alicia Fisk and her daughter Kara. Please know that we all support you both very much. I'd also like to welcome Spiros, a Fisk family friend from far away Greece. ...Spiros. Now, Spiros, you've-- you've talked a lot about your close friendship with Michael, but for the life of me, you never told us how the two of you met. Oh, is, uh-- Was a long time ago. They don't want to hear this. Oh, please, we'd love to hear it, wouldn't we? Really, is not a good time. - Is it a good time? - Good time. I'm afraid I have to insist. I'd like to hear it. You know, I never heard it, either. You want the truth? All right. I will tell you the truth. Michael Fisk and I... met... in a dentist's office. No, no, this is, uh-- this is true. One day I am sitting in this sad place where they fix the, uh-- It's a very sad place, the dentist there, he is not a happy man. And suddenly, this guy walks into the room. Everything changes. He is-- He is amazing. He is funny, he tells me stories of Greece and the places that he's been, the people he loves. And I am so taken with him... that I-- I follow him. No, no, I swear to God, I-- I-- The next day, he's in the village, I'm-- I'm spying on him. He's talking to strangers and he's... driving his car and I'm peeking through the windows of his house. I swear, I'm suddenly, um-- What, uh, peepee Tom? - Peeping. - Peeping Tom. All right, and no longer Spiros, now I am Tom, nice to meet you all. Michael Fisk, he change me. And he never knew it. The last time I ever spy on him... I see him alone... where he is-- he's very peaceful. Quiet. And I know I have a connection with this guy. I think we will have this connection - the rest of our lives. - All right. - Okay. - Yeah. To Michael Fisk. To Michael Fisk. - Michael. - PHIL: Opa! Is that story true? About my dad? Yes. What was he like? Back in the day. - You mind? - No, go ahead. Well, you know what kind of man he was. I'm not sure I ever knew my dad. Oh, this is not true. What he did does not change who he was. Well, he wasn't a man who hung himself in a tree very often. So what he did is who he was. The father I thought I knew could never have done that. Maybe he just, uh-- He just-- He loses sight of himself. I just keep wondering if-- What? If things had been different... or if we had been different, maybe-- No, no, no, no, this is not you. Your father-- He tells me once, - an unexamined life... - ...is not worth living. Socrates, right? Maybe somewhere along the way he stops examining. Whatever, is-- is his choice. Can you imagine? Sometimes. Come inside. - Alicia. - Sam. - Hi. - Hi. Spiros, you remember Sam. Ah, Spiros. Hi. I didn't think you were coming. I wasn't going to, but I am s-- so happy to see you. Me, too. I'm so sorry I missed the funeral. No, come on. I have not been behaving very well. Well... you and me both. Well, it's nice to get-- Whoo! Get out of the house and get some fresh air. - Yeah. - Care for a pizza? No! Thank you. - Ooh. - Are you okay? You no like pizza? Me no like anything right now, Spiros. I'm pregnant. Uh-- - Are you kidding me? - I'm pregnant. - Oh, my-- - No, I'm not. - Oh, my God. - I'm not. - This-- Wow! - I'm pregnant. - I'm pregnant. - Wait, how-- How many-- Wow! How many weeks? It's been a while. It's been a while. - I can't-- Oh, it's nice to just tell you that. - Oh, Sam-- Dr. McGuire, there are people down here, doctor, who desperately need your help. Abscesses, swollen gums, hyperdontia, you name it. Shit! Ahh! - Mrs. Fisk? - Ahh! Everything all right? No. No, detective, it's not. What can I do for you? Well, at your suggestion, I had a chance to review the security tapes from the Promenade the night before your husband's death. And, uh, I think I know now who's been following you and your family. I come as quick as I can. How bad is the leak? Philip McGuire-- AKA Spiros, you're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Get all his pockets, guys, let's get him in the car. Get that bag, we'll take that bag. That's not entirely accurate. I mean, it's accurate, but you make it sound worse than it was. All right, well, explain to me why it's not so bad that you tricked a widow into letting you look through her dead husband's possessions. You won't understand. Try me. All right. To me, Michael Fisk... was this guy who I thought had figured it all out. He'd found a-- a way to actually live a life. Good to see you. And then he killed himself. And if he killed himself, what did that say about me? I wanted-- No. I needed to find the reason why. Did you? Did I what? Did you find out why? Yes, I did. So, what, drugs, gambling? Was the guy in debt, was he sick? He was cheating on his wife. His wife. Ah, shit. Yeah. Shit. And when his girlfriend got pregnant, he couldn't handle the consequences, so he... Goddamn. Well, thanks. Hang tight, all right? Let me ask you just one last question. Discovering why, did it help you, did it make you feel better, you know, about yourself, about your own life? It was supposed to but... no. There's some good news. Mrs. Fisk isn't gonna press charges, but, uh, there'll be a restraining order I'm gonna go talk to the guys. You need anything? No. - You bastard. - Oh! God. You scared me. How-- How did you-- I wanted to meet you. The actual you. The person capable of... doing this. The restraining order. I can't be within 100 yards of you. No, that applies to you, not me. I can get as close to you as I want. I can get close enough to shoot you if I want. You'd like that, though. Wouldn't you? That would relieve you of responsibility for your life or something. Is that-- - It isn't like that. - No? You weren't hoping to find some terrible secret about Michael to give your life worth? And you succeeded, right? You discovered that Michael was having an affair with Sam. The detective told you that? You're actually upset he violated your trust? - No, I-- - Wow. I-- I found out that Michael and Samantha had gone away for a weekend to Big Sur. He bought her things, he bought her expensive jewelry. I have documentation of the whole thing. I didn't tell you to spare your feelings. Well-- How... chivalrous of you. How-- How gallant! That weekend was Sam's wedding. And the-- And the jewelry was a gift from us to Sam and her bride. Yeah. Sam's gay. How's your life now? Phil? I want my husband's hat back. By the way, I'm gonna sue you. $30,000 for the damage you did to my house. I'm sorry about that, Alicia. I never meant for any-- And stay away from me, okay? Just-- Just stay away from me and Kara. Okay? And go back to your own life. You have 167 messages. Dear Dr. McGuire, I waited for you as long as I could. Please consider this my resignation. In the three years we worked together, I came to admire you. You didn't have the most exciting job or glamorous, but you showed up every single day, you did your best, and you gave people nicer teeth. I was so proud to be part of that. But now it's over, and that makes me super sad. Goodbye, Dr. McGuire. I hope whatever you're doing brings you happiness. Very truly yours, Rahel. You shouldn't be up there! Uh, Phil McGuire? Back that way. Phil? Mm-mm. He's in the next bed. Hey. Hey. All right. Listen, man, um, I feel bad. I feel responsible because you were trying to tell me, and I wasn't paying attention. I just-- I didn't believe that you were actually gonna try and-- Malcolm, I didn't try and kill myself. Come on, man, you jumped off freakin' 120 foot bridge. I came as close to dying as a person can. And I didn't. What does that tell you? I don't know, that you're an idiot? Yeah. And I take... responsibility for it all. I'm sorry. And I couldn't screw up my life any more, but I'm still here. Huh? Are you here to stay? Yeah. How do I know? Because last night, I fought harder to save my life than I ever fought to take it. All right. We got bigger problems now. Do you have any idea how much paperwork I'm gonna have to wade through to renew your life insurance? Ow. Oh, so I'm still insurable. - No. - No. - No, right? - Fuck no. Ohh... All right. Check this out. - Ow! - Sorry. - Gentle. - Um... Here. Oh, God. The show. She-- She said she was in the chorus. Yeah. She was the understudy to Mabel, and Mabel got mono. She's pretty good. Some pretty sweet pipes. God's sake! I dialed a 9 and a 1. Tell me why I shouldn't hit the last 1? I found a note. A note? From Michael. It's still sealed. The Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, "Everything flows, nothing stands still." If everything's always changing, and every question can't have an answer, why are we here? We just are. Why do we die? We just do. Looks good. Good night, Dr. McGuire. Guess who's going skydiving this weekend. Oh, I'll bet, uh... you are? I am. I am. Where are you off to? Uh, I have a date. Maybe we're not meant to know. That's wonderful. Maybe everything is not, you know... knowable. Maybe it's enough for us to just be. No, but I really couldn't tell. You were a little bit here, a little there. You know what I mean. Yeah. Well, did you like it, honey? Sorta. I guess maybe I'm not that into musical theater after all, Dad. - I'm really sorry. - No. It's fine, honey. It's fine. - Oh, hi, doggy. - Hey. - Hi. He's so cute. - He's a good looking guy. - So, you excited? - So excited. Did your mom renew your passport? Yes. Oh, and Socrates. He had another quote. "I know one thing... that I know nothing."
