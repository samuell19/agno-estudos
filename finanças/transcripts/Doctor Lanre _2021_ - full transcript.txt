Who do we have here? Male, 35 years old, multiple lacerations, a concussion with possible internal bleeding caused by a car accident. And who else was in the accident? The vehicle that ran him over. Oh! Wow! What about the driver? He fled the scene as we were told. So, who is responsible for him? We found his health insurance card in his wallet And a number of someone we believe to be his sister. We called her immediately. And, what did she say? She's on her way as we speak. So, we need to act very fast, right? Sure, sir! All preliminary tests, we need to start. CT scan, test, inform the lab. And let Lanre know that we have a patient. Yes, Doc. Right? Yes, Doc. Thank you! When you're done... What exactly do the results say? Mimi? But, Doctor, I thought... You and Doctor Ben already went through the patient's file? Yes, we did. But, I'm asking you a question here. Do you have a problem with that? No, sir. A 35-year old male with multiple lacerations and a concussion sustained from a car accident. Further tests now revealed that there is internal bleeding. With a high possibility of Hertomai if he is not attended to as soon as possible And we risk having him degenerating to haemorrhagic shock if the bleeding isn't stopped as soon as possible. Yes, Doctor. Okay, have the emergency team erm.. Contacted the police about this incident? Yes, Doctor. Okay. And, has the family been contacted for erm.. Consent forms signing? Err... not exactly. What do you mean, "not exactly?" It is either a yes or a no. Well... his sister is on her way here. But she called to say she's stuck in traffic. And seeing as we needed to proceed immediately, she called Doctor Ben and gave a verbal consent "Verbal consent." Well... she would sign the form as soon as she gets here She said. That will have to do. Err... Go ahead, I'll join you shortly. Okay sir. You're smart. But, no matter what your defense is You'll suffer permanent disgrace Because there'll be no flag picking up the shame of what you've done. I think we- all of us here know what evil is. Of course, we do. We all have a sense of what evil is. But what you've done is pure evil! Detective, come on. I thought you were smart enough to know the difference Between the truth and lies. The trust of the innocent is the liar's most useful tool. Tell me; How do you know when someone is lying? Very simple! They look you straight in the eyes and tell you things that are contrary to what we all know is the truth "They look you straight in the eye," you say? Yeah. I thought all liars did everything they could to avoid eye contact. Actually, that is pure myth. Yeah. And, do you know why they do that? You were going to tell me. Of course, I will. The very best liars in this world look straight into your eyes Because they want to see if you believe their lies. So, you see it? Each time you keep staring into my eyes and repeating your lie, I know exactly what you're trying to do. But, unfortunately, it won't work for you this time. Because we would make sure you rot in jail. Hun hun. If I'm guilty, I'll spend the rest of my life rotting in jail. Honestly, how can you not see it? I thought you were trained to tell right from left? Did you do it? Seriously? Someone is trying to drop a ball here. How can you not see it? We see it. I mean, we see everything. We see that you are the culprit. Because all fingers point at you. It's easy to spot a liar in the house. It's not far-fetched from... you! Integrity is telling oneself the truth. Honesty Is telling that same truth to others. The truth will eventually come out. Just wait for it. Patience, doctor. Patience. Are we ready? Yes sir. Okay. Amen! Amen! Play. Is everything okay, sir? No. No. What's the matter, sir? Doctor! Doctor Lanre, the longer the wait... What's going on? The longer the wait... Stay here. Doctor Lanre! So, Are you telling me he just walked out of the OR just like that? That's exactly what I said. So, what happened after that? After what? After he walked out of the operating room. I followed him out. And I stayed far away from him. Haa! Okay. I don't care. Doctor Lanre! Doctor Lanre! Stallion. Lion King! Hun hun. Eh eh. See my new lingerie. Well-done. Well-done! This one will be good for twerking. Come on. Oya, back it up. Back it up. Are you ready to receive? Back - it - up. Are you ready to receive? Ehhh! Wai..t. Easy. Slow, slow, slow. Slow, slow It's okay now Slowwww It's me that will kill you. Hun, wait! Hun? What happened? Focus now. Focus. Focus. Yes, I'm here. Okay, slow, slow. Haa! Ehhh Li-on king. Lion king. Why do you like all these 'back businesses'? Back tins. You know back is easy. This place swells up quickly. Let's try that place too. No. No. I've not recovered from yesterday's session. You've not done standing Tiger before. No. Let's do shadow-snake in the Monkey shadow. Monkey shadow. Leave it now. Wait, now. What is "wait?" You cannot take that call. You cannot take this call. It's 'husband and wife' time. Why is the phone on ring mode? Look now! You know it has to be the hospital. Which hospital? And they wouldn't call me if it wasn't an emergency. If it's not an emergency, right? There'll be an emergency in this house. If you pick this call, there'll be an intense emergency in this house. Baby, I'm sorry. I have to answer it. I have to pick this one. Sorry baby. Hello. Doctor Jude. Hello, Nurse Mimi. There's a situation here. What situation? You want to go. Alright, let's quickly do "emergency" here. One. One "emergency." I'll see you later. Jude. Juudee. Doctor Jude. You expect us to believe that your lead surgeon was losing his mind under your nose. And you did not even notice. Detective. Depression is like any other sickness, you know. I mean, people don't show symptoms of running a temperature or catching a cold or anything like that True. But, it was a key staff member. Your responsibility. See, Doctor Lanre is the smartest human being you will ever meet. Now, if he wanted to hide a medical condition Believe me, there will be nothing for you to see. You can lie all you want. But I promise you, We will get to the bottom of this and everyone will know who you truly are. I know you are the smartest man in your profession and you think you can do anything and get away with it. What you fail to understand is that We, also, are the best in what we do. And we've seen so many of your kind in the past. What is going on here? Barrister.. I'm Barrister Igho. I'm Barrister Igho. And I ask again, I'm Barrister Igho. I'm Barrister Igho. What is going on here? What is going on here? Because it looks to me that you're questioning my client without his lawyer present. We were not aware that the good doctor here has already contracted the services of a lawyer. Yes, he has. I hope the've not coaxed you into saying anything that they can twist to incriminate you. I only told them the truth. And I'm sure that you know that whatever he said before I got here would be inadmissible in the court. Because it was said under duress. If he was innocent as you claim, then, what could he have said? That's what I'm here to find out. Please excuse us. I need some privacy with my client. Lanre, I need you to tell me everything. I mean, everything that happened. Without leaving out any details. So this is where you chose to come and hide. What is going on? Why are you here by this time? You don't get to ask the questions. I need answers. What is going on? I've been calling your line. Switched off. Oh. Well, I put my phone to erm... flight mode. So, I would not be disturbed. Why is that? Imade, what is this about? What's this thing I hear that you walked out on a patient in the OR? Oh, since when did you become a staff of this hospital? That is not the answer to my question. Okay. Honey. Since when did you become interested in my business? Lanre, we've been together for what?- 18 months You don't know that your business is my business? You didn't get the memo? Yeah. I didn't know that you had any specific interests in any part of my business. Not until you walked out of my brother in the OR. I'm sorry. Your brother? My brother. What was your plan? To kill him? To let him die? Who sent you? Your brother. My brother. Osahon Edhosa. Who... Who is Osahon Edhosa? Are you kidding me? You are going to pretend that you don't know that my brother is Osahon Edhosa? I've been talking to you about him. You don't know? You want to pretend? Wait! Hold on! Something is not right here. Something is wrong. Erm... A few months ago, you told me your brother was coming to visit. And I couldn't be in the house because I was called away for an emergency at the clinic, yes? Yes? What has that got to do with anything? He has been in the house. Are you okay? You need to tell me that, that monster was in my house? You walked out on a dying man in the OR and you're calling him a monster. Really? Imade, I don't care who that person is to you. All I know is that he's a monster. And he deserves to be killed. Really! Yes. Really! And, please, I need to be alone. Right. I am going to leave because obviously, there's something going on with you. You're not okay. You are not alright. Please leave. But know this, If anything happens to my brother, you and this entire hospital You guys are going down. Doc! Doc, good evening, sir. Yes, what's the situation? I'm afraid we have a very serious case here. From the CT scan report, we need a neurosurgeon like now. Patient has been stabilised, internal bleeding stopped, external bleeding stopped, induced coma But we need to act fast. Okay. Okay. So, I already read the report on my way here on my phone. And I've spoken to Doctor Sam who would be coming from another hospital. He should be here shortly. Alright Doc. So, let's see him. Okay. I can see that he sustained some lacerations. Okay. Okay. Right. Now, let's go see the man who put us in this situation in the first place. Haa. Imade. How're you feeling? How do you expect me to feel when one of your colleagues is trying to kill my brother? Your brother? Yes! Why is Doctor Lanre trying to kill him? Erm, what exactly is going on? What's wrong with Lanre? I wanted to ask; did both of you get into a fight or something? You want me to stand here and banter words with you When my brother's life is in danger. Am I hearing you correctly? Did you say the patient is your brother> My only brother, sir. Right. Anyway, don't worry. We have everything under control. Under control. I want my brother out of this hospital to a place where he is safe and well attended to. Imade. Your brother is safe. I've already sent for another doctor to come and handle the procedure. He should be here within the next ten minutes. I do not care. I want my brother out of this place. See, I understand how you feel and you have every right to feel that way. But I am going to tell you two things: Now, firstly, your brother's condition is very delicate. If we move him from here, he will not make it to another hospital alive. So, just calm down. He will be fine, hun. Just give us an opportunity to right the wrong that Lanre has committed. Because he has not only put me in trouble but everybody else in this hospital. So, please, allow us to remedy this situation. Please! What is going on here? Lanre, can you please tell me what is going on here and why I had to be dragged out of the comfort of my home when I have a doctor on call? What do you want to hear? "What do I..." "What do I want to hear?" Isn't that why you're here? You walked out of the OR You walked out not minding how that would affect the life of the patient. And to make it worse, this patient happens to be your girlfriend's brother. Is it something she did? I don't get it. What's going on here? Okay. I'm sorry. Okay. I don't need an apology! I need an explanation. Tell me why you walked out on that patient. I don't know, okay. I just had to leave. You risk your job. The reputation of this hospital. You turn your back on the hippocratic oath that you swore to save lives. And all you have to say to me is that you don't know? Are you out of your natural mind? Doctor! Please! Please! Calm down. You'll lose your job. The hospital could face dire consequences if your girlfriend decides to make good her threat And sue us! She's a lawyer, remember? I know. Doctor, yes, I know. I understand all of these. And I'm sorry. Okay! I'm sorry. I sincerely hope that there are no consequences to the hospital for my actions but… I just more than anything want to just go home. And catch a break. Alright. So, I'll be reporting this incident to the hospital board and recommending you for immediate suspension. Doctor Lanre. No. Am I standing in the presence of the great Doctor Lanre? No flattering today. Who's flattering who? You know I tell it like it is. Come here, man! It's so good to see you. Yeah. It's good to see you. How're you doing? I'm fine, thank you. I have this emergency I need to attend to. Can I call you later? Sure! Sure! No problem. Hold on. Why am I the one to attend this procedure When you're here? I'm… It's a long story, doctor. I have an emergency I need to attend to. I'll talk to you on the phone later. Yeah. Yes, come in. Doctor. Doctor Sam. Yes, doctor. You're welcome. Yeah. So, I already sent you all the records and tests results required. Yes, yes. I went through them on my way here. Awesome. What about the patient? Is he Lucid? Erm… not quite. He's in an induced coma. Okay. We really do not have much time. Yes. I'll get to work right away. Please do. What about Doctor Lanre? I saw him on my way here and he seems sort of off. Did you ever wonder why we needed to bring you in when Lanre was available and also on call? Exactly. That's what I wanted to ask Lanre. But he cut me off abruptly. Remember the doctor who dropped the ball? Yes. Don't tell me he was the one. Right. What are you doing here? Mimi. What are you doing here? Do you want to get me into trouble? Not a word of this to anybody. Then leave before someone finds you here. Leave! I'm going. Just go. So, that's our man. Wow! Wow! Wow! I see what you mean about cerebral lacerations. And you say the person responsible for this ran away. That is the report we got. We really need to start having someone We do. But that's a discussion for another day. True. I'll proceed. Can I have the rest of the team? Let's get to work. Yes sir. Mimi, what are you still doing standing there? Erm… Why are you acting like something is wrong? Nothing is wrong, sir. I'm just waiting for Nurse Chioma to get here before I leave. Doctor Ben mandated that we have at least, one nurse physically present with a patient at all times. Okay… That's not a bad idea but Doctor Sam just gave a new instruction. Because the patient needs to be moved ASAP Yes. Erm… She would be here any moment from now. She only went to get a cup of tea. It's okay. It's okay Doctor Jude. Let me get you… So that you can change. Doctor Jude. What is going on? We're about to go into surgery right now. Okay. This is doctor Sam. He's the one that I brought in to handle your brother's case. Ready? Yes. He's the only one I have. Please help me save him. I can see you've had a very sad night. Sadness doesn't look good on you. So, I'm going to go in there and do all I can to put a smile back on your face, okay? Okay. Thank you. I'll be right here praying and waiting. No, no, no. I think you should go home and rest. It's going to be a couple of hours before we're done. Okay? Please. Thank you, again. I have to go now. Thank you. Alright. Please go home and rest. Hey! Hi! No, no. Sit. Sit. No, I can stand. I don't... Sit down. Sit down. Okay. Erm… So, how's he? The surgery went well. Your brother is fine. Okay? Thank you so much. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to do that. No. It's okay. It's fine. It's fine. It's okay. Okay. It's alright. Okay. Can I see him? Not… Not right now. Okay. He was heavily sedated. So, he's still in recovery. What can I do? I want to see my brother. Well, I have an idea. And if my idea works, which is totally up to you, by the way. Then, you can see your brother. Doctor, anything. Anything. I would do anything. I just want to see Osahon, please. Please. Alright. Alright. What I want you to do is to go home, sleep, refresh, have breakfast. So that you don't break down and become our patient here. But, doctor, I… No buts. No buts Alright? I'll take you early to recovery to see him afterwards I'll drop you off at home. You sleep, refresh and have breakfast. I don't want to go home. I see you don't want to see your brother. No, no, no! Fine. You win. Actually, you win. Let's go. Come with me. Thank you! Lanre, I need you to give me something I can work with on this case. I can't defend you if I don't have anything concrete. Because, in case, you're not aware, all evidence is pointing at you. All the evidence is pointing to me because they're all fixated on me. No, Lanre. You want to know the truth? All fingers are pointing at you as the killer. I didn't kill anyone, Barrister. Then, help me prove it. What are you doing here? I came to get my stuff. I used to live here, remember? I can see you've been smoking and drinking. And how's that your business? Exactly. It's none of my business. You can do whatever you like. Exactly! Lanre, this is not you. All of these isn't you at all. Please! Talk to me. I love you. Walk me through it. What is going on? The surgery was a success, thanks to Doctor Sam. Imade, you don't know me. You don't know me at all. So, please, leave. You know you can talk to me, right? Please! I love you. What part of "please, leave," do you not understand? Lanre. Imade, please, leave. It is me. Please leave! Imade! Leave! Lanre. Hello. Hi. Is my brother awake now? Yes, yes. I'm coming. I'll be with you shortly. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. Driver, please. Move faster. Oh please pick. "He's awake." Welcome back. How do you feel? Thank you! God heals. Are you okay? Please, can I see you before I leave? Okay. I'm coming back. Sam, thank you so much for doing this for me. Nah. Saving lives? Isn't that the oath we took? Yes. But you didn't just save lives here. You saved an entire hospital. Not to mention several jobs. Don't mention. I'm just glad to have been of assistance. I'm sure if the roles were reversed, You'd have done the same for me. I know. But thank you all the same. Now, what I really don't understand and would love to find out What exactly happened to Lanre? Believe me, you're not alone. I would also like to understand what exactly the issue is. Is he in the office? I'd like to talk to him. No, no, no. He's been suspended until the matter clears. We just rose from a meeting of the board where we decided to launch an internal investigation to get to the root of all these. Really? Of course! And until the case is closed or the patient recovers He's also not permitted to come anywhere near this premises. Wow! That's extreme. I can't afford to take any chances. Hey. Hi. When was the last time you had a good night's rest? There's time for everything. Yeah. Your brother needs time to fully recover. The last thing he needs is you breaking down. I'll try not to. I'm glad you said trying. Because your trying starts now. How do you mean? Well, I was just coming from your brother's room and I told him that I'd like to take you out for a walk So you could get some sunlight on that beautiful black skin of yours. Doctor Sam. The answer is still no. Really? Hun, hun. Okay, well, if I can't take you outside for a walk, perhaps, I could take you out to dinner. You're not serious. Try me. So, now that you've had a rest, erm… you've gone home, freshened up and had something to eat, you feel better? I do. Thank you so much. You waited for me to have my bath. You took me for dinner. Thank you! Don't mention. It's okay. So, when do I see you again? Erm… soon, I hope. Okay Common! Soon! You treat my brother, so.. Alright. Soon, I guess. I'll be seeing you around. Yeah. Ha. What took you so long? I've been waiting for you. Come, come, come, come. Let's continue. Continue what? What do you want to continue? Please! Please! Come now. Are you not the one that said I've not been doing my duties I've not been performing well in bed And I decided to make it up to you. That's Motunde of the past Really? Of the past. I'm tired. You want to overuse me I'm no longer interested, my husband. You're the bulldozer. You're the champion. In fact, Lion king. Come on. Let's do this… Do what? You're looking for someone to kill. Go and marry another wife. He's using me raggedly. You can see I'm eating like one who's starving. So, what you're saying right now is that you're giving me your blessings And your permission to go and marry another woman who will come into this house unto this bed and fill in the gaps that you're unable to fill. I think I know someone that can recommend… I understand, you can't do... You can't be joked with, just a little. I understand that you're very… Let's have it. However, you'll come from behind. Because my privates are swollen-heated. Wait! Wait! Where are you coming with pepper on your hands? No pepper. Go and wash your hands. My privates would start to hurt. Why are you walking like that? Underneath is heated I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. Please calm down. Just get me out of here. Please, you're not fit to go. What is going on here? I heard him screaming and ran over immediately. What's happening? Get me out of here, please. I need to go. Osahon, you're not strong enough. You're not. He wants to kill me. Who? Who wants to kill you? Your boyfriend. What?! He came in here all dressed in black. With a syringe. He wants to harm me. I need to go! Just calm down. I'll see the doctor. Just calm down, please. I want to gooo. Just relax. I'm going to see the doctors now. What's going on here? I need to get my brother out of here. I've told you. Madam, calm down. I need to get him out of here! My brother's life is in danger. I need to move him. Calm down. No. I'm not going out. Okay, let's go out. What is Doctor Lanre doing in my brother's room? Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. What is he doing in my brother's room? Please, he's on suspension. With strict instructions never to enter this place. So, what's he doing in my brother's room threatening him. Calm down Are you sure your brother saw Lanre? Oh! My brother now is crazy. He's mad, right? That's not what I'm saying. So, what are you saying? I need to see Doctor Jude. That is not what I am saying. Where is Doctor Jude? Doctor, please come. The patient. What about him? Which patient? Osahon! Osahon! Osahon! What's happening? Osahon? Somebody help him! Osahon! Osahon! Please, let's go outside. I want to see my brother. Please, let's allow the doctor to do his job. Osahon! Baby. Lion king Stallion That's how you continue to hype one. You were running when I was saying you should come back for more yesterday. I didn't run. I didn't run at all. If you eat all the food today which one would you eat tomorrow? That's right. Lyrics. This your phone It hasn't rung since yesterday. Why? Is it faulty? That is because I switched it off. What did you say? Yes! I switched it off. Doctor Jude. You? You switched off your phone? Yes. You switched off your phone. Why? I've never seen this in my life. Since I've known you, you've never switched off this phone. Why did you switch off the phone? You're running from people, right? Debtor. I don't think you're owing anyone money. It's those bastards following you everywhere because of this thing. They're following you because of 'machine gun'. Okay! Fine, fine, fine. Okay, let me confess. Confess. Maybe I'll forgive you. Okay. The reason I switched off the phone Is so that my beautiful, delectable, insanely adorable sexy beyond words Miss Planet Of a wife Can have me all to herself Without any distraction. My Stallion. My Bulldozer. 'My womb shifter'. You're the only one that does surgery on this bed. Really! You'll adjust the womb and rearrange it. My husband. Go to work, I'll be waiting. Let me do 'some shifting'. Let me do 'some shifting'. No. Leave. When you arrive. No. Leave. When you arrive. Let me apply hot cloth. You'll see me like this, when you arrive, You'll find me like this. I'd be waiting for you It's the mouthing off. Bulldozer! You are my Bulldozer. My husband If I do it appropriately you would have an erection Please leave. Are you sure you don't… Just checking. Kill me, alright. Lunatic He wants to destroy my life.. 'Womb destroyer'. I need hot water. Jesus! I'd like to see my brother. Please Imade, I'll need you to calm down. I'm calm. Please, do calm down. The doctor is checking in on him. What's going on, Nurse? Doctor! What's happening? Why's she stopping me? I want to see my brother. Please calm down. Calm down, madam. I'm calm. Please, I would like to see my brother. What is going on? Why are you guys stopping me? Calm down, madam. I am calm. What is going on? I'm sorry, we lost him. Lost who? I'm sorry. We lost your brother. Calm down. No. Calm down. No. Osahon! Miss Imade. Osahon! Osahon! "He's dead." So, the moment after the patient died You sent Doctor Lanre a message. Which simply said, "He's dead." Why did you do that? I was just telling him what happened. Why? I don't know. I... It's just what came to my mind. When I couldn't reach Doctor Jude. Why were you unable to reach Doctor Jude? I don't know. I kept calling, but he didn't pick. It just kept ringing. So, when did you find out that the patient was dead? Yes, I heard the sister of the deceased screaming when I arrived at the hospital. That was when you found out? Yes. Considering the circumstances surrounding the deceased Didn't you find it strange that nobody called you to tell you what had happened before you got to the hospital? Well, my phone was off that night. I thought you doctors don't switch off your phones. We don't. My battery was flat. And you had no power to charge your phone in your house. Well… wait. Hang on a minute. I mean, am I under investigation here? I mean, felt I was just here to give information about Doctor Lanre. Whom we all know is the murderer here. You aren't. You're not under investigation. Yet… Look, if you don't have any other questions to ask me, then, I need to leave. I have a hospital to run. No more questions for now. Thank you! So, one more question for you. You were the nurse on duty that night, right? Yes. And your patient said he saw Doctor Lanre that night. Ye… No. Which one is it? Yes or No! Well, he said, "Your boyfriend tried to kill me." And everyone knows that her boyfriend is Doctor Lanre. That was before he walked out on her brother in the operating room. What are you saying? They broke up immediately he left the OR. And she moved on rather quickly to Doctor Sam. And there's no way her brother could know that. Not if the good doctor asked for his permission. To take her out. I see. That would be all for now. There's something else I think you need to know. Something Doctor Lanre told me in confidence. In the beginning, I thought this case was going to be smooth and fast. But, now it has become more complicated than I can even imagine. That I'm beginning to doubt myself. You too? What do you mean? Today, the nurse told me something that completely threw me off. And if what she said is right, then this case has become far more complicated. What did she say? The sister of the deceased in her statement told us that her brother said that her boyfriend threatened his life. Yeah. And automatically, we concluded that the boyfriend is Doctor Lanre. Because he was the one she was dating. And then, what if he isn't? Look, what do you mean? I need you to calm down. But before we continue At what point did you start doubting yourself? In a bid to dig deeper into the possible connection Between the doctor and the nurse I asked doctor Jude Didn't he find it strange that the hospital did not call him to inform him of the deceased passing away. And what was his response? He said erm… his phone was off all night. And erm… he couldn't charge it. I then asked, didn't you have power to charge your phone all night? Wait a minute. The nurse said that she tried calling doctor and he didn't pick up. That explains why she sent an SMS to Doctor Lanre. What? She also said something. About our doctor. Something I think we should act on real fast. Very fast! Very fast! Very fast! Open it. I see that Mimi couldn't keep her mouth shut. She was brutally raped and murdered. You're preaching to the choir, detective. The case was never solved. And whose fault was that? Listen. I know what happened to your sister was terrible. But that doesn't give you the right to take laws into your hands. Especially when you do not have any conclusive evidence that he was the one that killed your sister. Come back! Somebody help me! No, I saw his face. With my own eyes. I... even sent a photo of him that I saw on her phone to the police. And what did you do with it? See, I don't have the words to articulate the pain you feel all these years. No, detective. You do not. Still, you shouldn't have killed him. When I saw him the OR All the feelings of anger, bitterness, fury came rushing back. I had to get out of that place before I did something that I'd regret later. On a virtue, you still killed him. Am I glad he died? Yes. Do I think he deserved to die? Absolutely! But did I kill him though? Did you? I wish I had the guts to do it, detective. But you threatened him. But I did not threaten him. I didn't. So, what time was it? Early. In the morning. Can anybody verify your story? No. Unfortunately, I made sure no one saw me. Doctor, do you believe in miracles? As a matter of fact, I do. You may need a lot of prayers to get yourself out of this mess. Because the only people who believe your story are the people in this room. That's us. But regardless of what we believe The fact still remains that they saw you walk out of that operating room And you visited the deceased in the hospital. And moments later, he died. What about my sister? What about what happened to my sister? You don't have a conclusive proof to that. But the court may decide to use your motive against you. And say you killed the deceased. How did he die though? I mean, no one's actually told me how he died. Well, he was complaining that he couldn't breathe. When I went to visit him in the OR, he was breathing rapidly And he was sweating. Despite the fact that the room was really cool. Now, you're telling me he had problems breathing. Hmm What does that mean? What I mean is If you check his toxicology report very carefully You will find the presence of foreign bodies in his bloodstream. Oh, please! English. Somebody injected him with something, detective. That, we already know. Do you know that irrespective of what you see in movies, It takes most of the deadliest poisons 6-12 hours to begin to have effect on human body. What are you saying? I'm saying that whoever did this thing did it a long time before he died. Probably the day before. Stallion king. I'm not hungry. What do you mean by you're not hungry? If you're not hungry, you need to eat. Put something in your stomach. Because you will need the energy this night. I'm going to get ready. What is your problem? Is that all you know? Like seriously, do you not care about me or about anything else? Do you care that my hospital may be shut down? Do you? What have I seriously done? I thought they said if one is tired, you'll need sex to relax. Does he have another sexual partner? Jude! My name is Doctor Ben Ike. My name is Chioma Okoli. I'm the DP here and the doctor on call the night of the accident. I was the junior nurse on morning shift on that day. And I was just resuming my shift that morning when the patient died. Anything outside the ordinary before he died? Nothing particularly. He just complained of shortness of breath. That was just it-shortness of breath. Yes, there was something definitely wrong with him. I was also the person on call, the night that the patient died. Tell us about Doctor Lanre. Doctor Lanre has always been a silent person. Hmm. Are you sure? Doctor Lanre has always been the very quiet type. And also very professional. We all have never seen him behave this way. Oh, Miss Imade. Welcome. Thank you. Please, sit. You said you have new information for me. Yes. There's a video I want you to see. So, just… What is this? What is Osagie doing? How did you get this video? Oh, sorry. Who is Osagie? Osahon's twin brother. They're twins? Yes! They are twins. But they're very different. Osahon is the most beautiful soul I've ever met. Osagie is just pure trouble. He gave our parents so much trouble that, they can't even bear it. One day, there was a shoot-out. And Osagie was shot. His friends-they left him to bleed to death. And he died. Actually, a friend of Lanre's sister sent this video to us. She said erm… she had a spy camera mounted in her house because she had two break-ins in a week. But unfortunately, it captured something else. But why didn't she come forward all this while? She tried, but she was scared. But she had this, so she had to send it in. But she no longer lives here. So, once again, Osahon paid for Osagie's sins. Oh my God! Is she okay? Pull up the chair! Are you okay? You're awake. What happened? Erm… You passed out, so we had to bring you to the hospital. I'm fine. No, no, no, no. You need to rest, okay? The doctor said you need to rest for a few hours. I'm fine. Please, you need to rest. Do you need anything? Hello. This is Ejiro. Am I unto Barrister Igho? Yes. Yes. I got your number from Nurse Mimi. Erm… I have something I think you'll like to see. Alright. Thank you. Hello. Erm… How are you? I'm not fine at all. What's the matter? I've been in the hospital since morning. Hospital? Why? I slumped at the Police station. I came in for a meeting. They rushed me to the hospital. Are you okay? Sam, I'm pregnant. Hellooo? Hello, are you there? Err… Er… Erm… Did you say pregnant? Yes! How? How else can a woman get pregnant? Sorry. Sorry. What meant to ask is; Who is responsible? Why am I here? Because we asked you to come. That's what I mean. Doctor, why are you anxious? No. I'm not anxious. I just… I just want to know why I'm here. You're here because we have more questions for you. Okay… How come you never told us that you and Doctor Lanre go a long way. Because you never asked. True. I didn't ask. There's a lot more questions I didn't ask you earlier on. You know. Ask away! Did you ever imagine that you could take Doctor Lanre's position in this hospital. I mean with the surgery. We know you and Imade are going out. And she's also pregnant. Of course, it's none of our business. Are you aware? Of course, I'm aware. Are you jealous of Doctor Lanre? How? I don't understand how you say you love someone But you don't trust them. Even before you knew that I was Osahon's sister You never trusted me with your pain. Is this why I'm here? To listen to the new Doctor Phil? I came to apologise for what my brother did. Haa. Someone has been watching the Police cinema. So you had to watch it-the video to believe me. And, yet, you sit there and speak to me about trust. Lanre, I cannot change the past. What my brother did It was wrong. But that is not an excuse for what you did. You killed him! You know, now, I wish there was a video that I could play for you, to show you that I'm innocent seeing as you only believe what you see. It doesn't matter what I believe. Your fate is in the hands of a Judge. Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Correct, at last! Look, Imade, I don't know what this is about. Honestly, I have no idea why we are here. Of course, you're bored with your new boyfriend. Boyfriend? What are you talking about? Okay. I think we're done here. I'd like to go now. I am… I am pregnant. Erm… Congratulations. I'm sure Sam will be a great father. Sam? What has Sam got to do with this? You tell me. I mean… Seriously, Imade, you think I don't know? You think I didn't see the both of you? For God's sake, Lanre! Nothing happened between us. He was just a friend. If you say so. So, who's the lucky man? I am 10 weeks gone. You're a doctor, Lanre You're a doctor, Lanre Do the maths. Do the maths. And for your information Osahon and Osagie were twins. Osagie committed the crime against your sister, not Osahon. Whoever murdered Osahon, murdered an innocent person. Lanre, Osahon never raped your sister. He was innocent. I think I know who killed him. I know who killed him. So, tell me. Why did it take you so long before you brought this in. So, after installing the CCTV at the hospital It wasn't supposed to start recording until we installed the hard drives. But then, I was looking for something on my cloud And I found the footage. Detective, this video is very conclusive. It clearly shows who the culprit is. After extracting the content of the bottle into the syringe, I was very unsure who the injection was for. As we didn't have it on our records as at that time. Until I picked up that same bottle from the bin. And realised what it was. And you're sure you saw this. Yes. I'm very sure. 100%. Ehh. Baby. I got the alert. But you sent me double of what I asked for. Of course! Anything for my beautiful wife. My Miss Planet, not Miss World. My sweetheart. My ATM Thank you. You're welcome. Don't worry. Let me quickly go out. I won't be long. When I come back, I'll cook a very delicious vegetable soup for you. When you finish eating that, I'll give you dessert. Hey! Stop! Don't let 'things' rise. Take all the time you need. My ATM Going somewhere? Errr… It's been a tough couple of days. So, I just thought I'd take some days off. Doctor Jude, you are under arrest for the premeditated murder of Osahon Edosa. What? Anything you say would be used against you in the court of law. Are you going to come with me willingly? Or I'll be forced to use this. No, that won't be necessary. Move it, sir. Move! I had just finished Medical School and was working. But I used to visit the main campus to see my girlfriend, Rose. He was a cultist who everyone feared. Osagie raped my girlfriend whom I had intended to marry. When I saw the name Osahon Edosa on that file I thought he had changed his name. Typical criminal. He asked her out repeatedly and still went ahead to have his way with her. She committed suicide immediately after finding out that she had gotten pregnant from that rape. How are you so sure that it was Osagie that raped her? She left a suicide note. He disappeared immediately after the act. What he saw, I mean, he was a strong man with all the powers he possessed as a cultist. When I saw him lying on that bed helpless, everything came back to me. She was a virgin. And we had talked several times about our wedding night. I knew it was revenge time when I saw him. Doctor Jude. You intentionally put everyone through this misery and head-racking. Just to find out that you intentionally killed the wrong person. I mean, you should have tended your case to the necessary authorities rather than putting the laws into your hands. Why? Come in. Please. Lanre. Imade. I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry that I didn't share my deepest hurts with you. I'm sorry about the way I treated you- the way I spoke to you the last time you came here. Imade, I'm sorry that I didn't believe enough in us. In my darkest moments, you were always there for me. I'm sorry that in this particular situation, I lost sight of that. But, Lanre, I… Look, the only thing that I'm not sorry about And I wouldn't take back is the fact that I absolutely love you. I do. A lot has happened. Imade, there is time for a lot more to happen. What about Bola? What about what Osagie did to her? My sister was murdered. As was your brother. We're both in so much pain. And that is okay. Really, Imade. It's okay. Imade, let us honour the memory of our loved ones. By choosing love instead of hate. Hope, instead of fear and anger. I'm sorry about your sister. I saw the footage. It was bad. I'm so sorry. It's okay, baby. It's okay, baby. It's okay!
