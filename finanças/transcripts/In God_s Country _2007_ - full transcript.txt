The Mormon church outlawed polygamy in 1890. But polygamous groups formed in spite of the church's ban. These communities believed that men must have at least 3 wives and as many children as possible. This was the true path to heaven. My community, Harmony, was founded on this principal. My parents and grandparents were born here. I was born here. So are my 5 children. This is the place we think of as home. We know nothing else. No other life. - Mother Erleen. - Good morning, Judith. - What a beautiful day! Good morning. Good morning. - How are my ladies? I trust you slept well. - Did you think about what I asked? - I'm still praying on it. Please be seated. Let's be sweet. Let us pray. Heavenly father... Yea I said to you. It shall be cleansed by fire. These are the dangerous times. Lines are being drawn between good and evil, between God's chosen people. And the sinful multitudes. We cannot drop our guard. We cannot betray our sacred secrets. We must at all cost protect our Prophet from dissidents. Every day we must live our lives by revelation. As Bishop of this great and holy church I'm directed to bring you some good news. Put oil in your lamps. Prepare your homes. Prepare yourselves as if Christ himself were arriving. For our dear Prophet is on his way. He will arrive tomorrow bringing us a great gift. There will be new marriages welcoming of sister-wives into our families. - I understand you've just turned fourteen? Perfect. You'll ride with me. Pearl. Awww... - Look at her. She's so good I have to wake her to feed her. - I wish mother was alive to see her. - Me too. She has mother's eyes. We're going to bless her on Saturday. You'll be there? - Of course. - Good morning, Jamie! - Oh. Thirsty cat and a bowl of milk. You worried? - I spoke to father Josiah. - Well then you'll know soon enough. If they can't marry then she'll get over it. She'll move on. She'll be alright. - I'd better go. Alice, Mark, let's go! - Mary Lou, he wants you. - But he won't take a bottle from me. - No. No. No. Mother Mabel can't be looking after your baby. She has her own to be concerned with. - Yes Mother Erleen. - And I am not your mother anymore, I am your Sister-wife and you're a grown woman so behave like one. It must be terrible not having an infant of your own. I'd die of shame if I only had 5 children. - Well it is Sister Judith's procreating time. - How observant of you Mary Lou. Then I suppose you must go to Father Leavitt tonight. - What are you doing here? - I had to see you. - If Mother Erleen comes out, you should go. - You think we'll ever do this? Hang the bed sheets? - We are hanging bed sheets. - Our bed sheets. I've been praying for us. You've been given one simple task. And now we have 9 burnt chickens! Nine! You have wasted God's bounty. Here. Make yourself useful out here. Useless, useless girl. - You should go. Jamie! I've been praying for us too. - Look at you. You are so beautiful. I've missed you. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what's on your mind. Could you undo your hair for me? Jamie's young, Judith. - I know, but I... - I know he works hard. Tithes well. Can I help you with this? Judith... If it helps at all... our working supports our work. They will be married. Didn't I tell you that I would speak to the Prophet? Hmmm? - You did. - It won't be long til we get to Harmony. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - Brother Thomas is this all of them? - Yes. All the men are here. - Good. Edward Martin stand up. These are your sins revealed to me by the Lord. You have questioned the Prophet. You have monopolized the loyalty of your sons. You have failed to keep your wives in order. Salvation rests in obedience and you have not been obedient. Your wives are no longer yours. Your children are no longer yours. Your Priesthood is no longer yours. You are like a filthy rag. Now gather your things and get you gone! George Collins. Stand up. This is your sin revealed to me by the Lord. You have disgraced your Priesthood by unsanctioned communication with a girl. You are like a filthy rag. - Morning. - You're working hard. - Mother Erleen says everything has to shine, even the floors. - And here I am dropping little bits of wood everywhere. I should be more careful. - Don't worry. I'll clean it up. - You'll make a fine wife someday. - Welcome, Prophet. - It's good to see you Josiah. - And you sir. - Community is growing, prospering. - We've been very blessed. - What a beautiful smile. She's going to make a lovely bride. - Yes. - Welcome my dear. You're going to like it here. Construction company's booming. The dealership broke a sales record this month. - Very good. - With success comes more scrutiny. - Yes there are many people on the outside who would like to see us destroyed. I need... I need to tell you something. In complete confidence. We're under such pressure. The people need a strong leader to guide them. - There's no one stronger than you sir. - Well Josiah... I'm... I'm not well. I'm going to name a successor. Our people need someone who can lead as I've led. - Well if you need my help, I'll do anything. Just ask. - I will. - Well there is one thing. - What's that? - My stepdaughter, Charlotte. She wishes to marry. - Tell me about her. - Well, she's sixteen. She's beautiful. Lovely. - And how old is the man? - Seventeen. - Hmmm... Well our young girls need... older husbands to guide them. Don't you think? - Yes of course. You're right. - I've got butterflies. - What if he doesn't like me? - He will. He's been chosen for you. - I wish my mother was here. - It'll be okay. It will really. There. That should stay put. You're a beautiful bride. - The Prophet told you? Did he say why? He thinks I'm not ready yet. - So what now? - Sister Pearl. As senior wife, take Sister Faye's hand and place it in the hand of brother Thomas. Fulfilling the law of Sara. Father Thomas, do you receive unto yourself Sister Faye as your lawful wedded wife? For time and all eternity in the new and everlasting Covenant? - Yes. - Hey. First wedding has started. - Uh-huh. I was finishing my prayers. - You know. In a couple of years, It'll be your turn to marry. So you must wonder... How do you know you'll make a good wife? How do you know you're developing properly? I mean most of the girls get someone to check them. - They do? - Hm-hmm. In secret. And like the Fathers say: Every secret you keep is a secret for God. I can check you right now. It won't take a minute. - Sister Faye. Do you take Brother Thomas with the Covenant and promise that you will keep all laws, rights and ordinances in this holy order of matrimony. And this you do in the presence of God angels and these witnesses of your own freewill and choice. - Yes. - You are husband and wife. - Get off of her! I seal you with the blessings of kingdoms, thrones, principalities, powers, dominions and exaltations. - Bitch. - Be fruitful and multiply. Go forth and replenish the earth. Together. - Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. - Mom it hurts. - I know sweetheart. - I'm sorry. - Don't you dare apologize! Well it's a pretty bad break. She's gonna need a cast six weeks at least. I also noticed there was quite a bit of bruising. On your daughter. You said that Alice fell but this type of break only happens when the bone is twisted. - She... must've twisted her arm when she fell. - Right. - Look if you don't tell me what happened there's nothing I can do to help. Okay. Well uh... I have to file a report and child services will be in contact with you. And as for you, let's get that arm into a cast shall we? What's your favourite colour? - Do you have purple? - Well yeah sure. - Purple's her favourite colour. She loves lilacs. Okay. - Just as... Adam was tempted by Eve sometimes our young men are tempted by the serpent seductress. It happens over and over. Young men are tempted... and young women are wounded. It interferes with our work. So... How do we solve this problem? - We ask our... our Prophet. - Yes we do. I want each one of you to pray and fast. I want you to pray for our Prophet who will find a solution. - You did just fine. - Can I sleep with you tonight? - Of course you can. - Are you okay? Good. Terrible. A wounded bird. You're a good mother. - Well you can't keep an eye on them all the time, can you? - No you can't. - You're back. - I need to talk to you about Alice. - Erleen says she's fine. - She's not fine. - It's just a broken arm. - I had to lie to the doctor. - Well he needs to mind his business. - Are you gonna do something about Nephi? - Now you mind your business. - Alice is your daughter. - Let me worry about it. I've always taken care of things, haven't I? - You want me to drive. Yeah? - Yeah. - Sure. - Okay. - Okay. - What are you doing here? - I'm here to see the parents of Alice Leavitt. I'm here to talk to the parents of Alice Leavitt. - That won't be necessary. That'll do, boys. - Yes, sir. - Hi. I'm Josiah Leavitt. I'm Alice's father. - I need to talk to you about what happened to your daughter. - Oh, what happened? She was playing in the barn. Jumping off of hay bales. - Playing? - Playing yeah. That's what 12 year-old girls do. - Well it seems to me here... - It seems to me that our time here is done. The boys'll show you out. - Alice is my daughter. - Did you see anyone? - I tried to stop... - Can you give me a name? - I'm sorry. - I can't do anything without a name. This isn't the end of this. - Come in. - Mother Mabel says you wanted to see me. - Come over here. What have you done to us? I told you I would take care of it. But you took it upon yourself to go behind my back. Speak to a Gentile. Judith, have you lost your mind? You betrayed me. - I'm sorry. - Sorry! You are sorry?! - She's my daughter. She's your daughter. - I always loved you the most. You were my favourite. But I can't say that anymore. Now go. GET! Shame on you! Beware of the woman who does not keep the secrets of our work. Who does not obey and take the direction of her husband. Beware this warning for you are playing with the fires of hell. Stand up woman. Hmmm... There she is. So... quiet. But do not be fooled children. There is rebellion in her. This wife has... betrayed our community. Has betrayed our beloved Prophet. Has betrayed God Almighty! She has conspired with Gentiles! As Abraham sacrificed his own son Isaac. So too shall I put away... my dearest possession forever. Go now. Get your children and be gone. Pray. Think on this and all of your sins. And until you have repented... No one here knows you. Let us all pick up our hymn books and turn to page 72. - Mama, nobody lives here. It's empty. 'Cause it's a dump. Why is this happening? - We can't stay here. Just for a little while. We'll clean it up. - I don't get it. Why did father cast us out? - He's angry. - Why? - It's between your father and me. When he calms down I'll talk to him. - You've gotta get back in his good graces. - Good morning, Mother Judith. Got a lot of weeds in your garden, huh? Weeds are hard to get rid of. - They are. Mark, where are you going? - Work crew. - Father Josiah's orders. - Five o'clock you come straight back. And you stay with that work crew. Hey. Brought you something. - You shouldn't have come. The Priesthood. You could lose your place. - I don't care. - Don't say that. - I don't. - My mother will ask Father Leavitt to forgive her. She will. And when she does, you and I can be together. - I came to see how you were. - You loved my father? - Yes. - So you know how this feels. - Yes. And 20 years ago you and Jamie could've married. But things have changed. - I don't understand. - The Prophet has made his decision. Do you really think that I could change his mind? - But Father Josiah might be able to do something. Pearl you shouldn't have come. - Here. The money from my sewing. Take it. - Thank you. What is it? - I've debated telling you this. If I didn't, you'd never forgive me. - What? - The Prophet's had a revelation. God told him the only way to protect our young girls is to give them husbands. He's taking a group of them back with him tomorrow. And Judith... One of them is Alice. - She's 12 years old! That day in the barn, you were 12. I tried to stop those boys. - I knew you did. - But I couldn't stop them. - But Judith you tried. You tried. What am I going to do? - Charlotte get up! Come on we gotta grab the boys. Get up there's a fire. Get up! Let's get up! Get up! Get up! Get up Kate. Get your shoes. Come on Alice. Get up. Get up. Alright. Let's go. Get in the car! Just get in the car. - You're going the wrong way. Where are you going? - I don't know. I just know we're not going back. Charlotte! Charlotte! - She got out, son. They all did. - Where are they? - They're gone. But I'll find them. It's okay. - Gone where? - I don't know, sir. - You need help getting her under control, Josiah. - No, Prophet. - Are you thirsty? - Why are you doing this? - Charlotte please. We can't go back. I'll be right back. - Hey Charlotte. What are you doing? - Hi. I need a ride to Harmony. - Sure! - Charlotte! What are you doing? - I wanna go back. - Get in the van! Where are we going? - Inside where they can help us. I'm not going in there. - There's Gentiles in there. - You have to take us back! - Don't argue with me please. We've been here forever. I'm scared. I know you are, sweetheart. - I wanna go home. - I know. - Me too. - Charlotte, will you hold Michael? - So if you're coming down the 403, take the main street exit. And you go to the east, sorry. Ah, I'm sorry you have to wait until your number's called. - Charlotte Elizabeth Joseph, Mark Joseph Leavitt, Alice Motley Leavitt, Kate Edith Leavitt... Michael Delroy Leavitt, we are from Harmony, my husband has 8 wives and 48 other children. There was a fire. - Okay. I'm sorry I'm gonna have to put you on hold. I'll get my supervisor. - This is for food and clothing. Now based on what you've told me, we will be able to get a restraining order in place right away. Does your husband know where you are? - No. - Good. We'll be able to get you some temporary housing. Are you okay? - Yes. - You have gotta make sure that neither you nor your children have contact with anyone who can tell your husband where you are. I'm going to give you a cell phone. If you get into any trouble, you call the police, okay? - Yes. - And... these are vouchers for school supplies. - School? - Your children have to go to school. - Well they can't, not yet. - They have to go to school. They're beautiful children. - I thought about leaving, I... I just didn't think about this part. About what happens now. - The house goes back to 1759. - I don't really care. And the house ownership, whose name is that in? - Church. - Church. And there's furniture inside who was living there? - No one. - No one? - Mmmm... Officer you saw the condition of the place. Now obviously it wasn't safe. Excuse me one minute. - Yes. - It's gonna be okay. He's known me for a long time. He's gonna call it an accident. - Was there an accident? - Well it looks like it. Works for us. He's leaving. Well sir? - We have a long drive ahead of us. - We'll be praying for your safe journey. - I will pray for you. - He left without an announcement. - It's her fault. - So um, if there's anything else you need or... if you have any other questions don't be afraid to call Ruth because she's awesome. - Thank you. - Okay, bye. - Oh here, let me get that for you. Hey what's your story? - Mormon. House fire. - Oh. Hmmm. - They're giving us a new house and some money for clothes and food and the new house is gonna be so much better than the old house. And... We'll go shopping. And I'll buy groceries and... we'll get some dinner and maybe after dinner some ice cream? - Oh good. - Okay. Charlotte, I need your help. - Look, Mark, she's naked. - I can't take off my undergarments. They protect me from... wicked people. - Oh I know, but you can just wear this over top, you don't have to take them off. Come on. Hey girl, I'm waiting for you. - What's that? - You can have a look. I don't know who writes that stuff but... - Oh no no no. - So how old are you, mister? - Five. - Wow! Now don't tell me these are all yours. - Yes. - Oh my lord. I thought 2 was a handful. Okay. Comes to $70.22. - Um... - You know what, I'm not gonna take this. - Um... You know what, you can probably use this coupon. Just... Yeah just use this. You're fine. - Thank you. - Yeah. No problem. Okay! Let me pack it up for you. - It says Wagoner's Trail Road. - Where are we going? - A new house! What number is it? - Thirty-five. - Charlotte please. Thirty-one. Thirty-five. Here we are. In there? - Charlotte please! - Will we be cast into darkness? - Oh sweetheart. If I thought that we wouldn't have left. - Can we still pray? - Of course we can. I'll be right back. Charlotte, if we're gonna get through this, we need to talk to each other. - Did you start the fire? - No. - Well then what happened? - I knocked over a lamp. - I don't believe you. - The Prophet was gonna take your sister. She's barely 12. - Why were they gonna let Alice marry? They won't let me marry Jamie and I'm 16! - Oh Charlotte. - Stop it! Stop saying that! Alice. Alice! - Alice. Come on! - What did you say to her? Alice! Alice! - Everybody hates me. - No they don't. - Mark does. - No he doesn't. - But he's says it's all my fault because of what happened. - It's not your fault. Did you see all the beautiful stars? There are names for them you know? - Really? - Mmm hmm. - What are they? - I don't know. - Why not? - I never went to school past grade 7. - Did you wanna go? - Yes. - Will I go? - Yes. - Well then maybe I can learn the names and then teach them to you. - Sweetheart you go inside. - Miss Joseph? - Yes. - I'm officer Amesbury. - Is something wrong? - Well a couple of hours ago, I came across the wire that your vehicle had been reported stolen. - But I didn't steal it. - Ah... Josiah Leavitt, your husband? - He wouldn't call the police. - Well he may be less interested in getting his vehicle back and more interested in using it to track you down. Understand? Okay, so I'm not gonna file anything but uh, you've gotta be careful. Somebody else sees that licence plate, things could go differently for you. - Thank you. - Sure. - The school bus is almost here! Charlotte, you can't stay in bed all day! This is silly. - It's here. I like your hairstyle. - Oh thanks, honey. Let's go. - Where are Alice and Mark going? - They're going to school. - Will they come back? - Of course they will. - Oh sorry. Hey! I don't know if you remember me? I work at the grocery store. It's Louise. - Oh hi! - Yeah hi. Listen, um... Goodvale's a small town and people kinda talk. So I just brought you some clothes and stuff. - Oh thank you. - It's mostly my kids' clothes. They've grown up and you know it's amazing how empty the house is without them. So... Ah... Are you busy right now? I thought maybe we could have some tea. I put a little teapot in there. - I'm sorry. I can't. - Sure you're busy. - I'm just going through the paper. I'm looking for a job. - Good for you. Good. Well good luck with that. - Thank you. It was really nice of you to bring these clothes. - My pleasure. Incest is best. Where's my mommy?! I mean my sister, I mean... My mommy! - Shut up! - Charlotte, this really nice woman came by with some clothes. And I thought you might find something in here that... that you might like. The woman from the grocery store. Can I make you something to eat? Hello. Yes. Is he okay? I'll be right there. I have to go to the school. Charlotte, you're gonna have to come out of this room sometime. - I know it's a difficult transition and we want to help as much as we can. But violence is not acceptable. - Of course not. - You have to make that clear to him. Now about his test scores. - He took a test? - To find the appropriate grade level. Both your children took it. Your daughter did quite well. But your son... Did he go to school in Harmony? - Ah... until 6th grade. And... Until he started working. - Ah. That explains why he's so behind. - Will he have to go back a grade? - Two grades. Ah wow! That looks bad. You ever been in a fight before? - Yeah. - Bet you're used to winning them eh? - Where I live, my father is the Bishop. - Ahhh... So the other kids look up to you. These first few weeks here are gonna be pretty rough for you, there's no question so... You just keep your head down and pretty soon you're gonna... look up and suddenly realize that you know your way around, you got a few friends and... You're not the new kid anymore. - How long is that gonna take? - Not long. - Trust me. - Oh! You're gonna have to keep some ice on that. - Hi. - Hi. - I need to talk to you for a second. - Okay. Uh, do you wanna wait for me in the van? - That's a great kid you got there. - Thanks. - I got a couple of boys myself around that age. They're living with their mom now, out east. But I mean I know you know how it is. Um, the restraining order paperwork came through so... if your husband shows up I want you to contact me immediately. Alright? - Thank you. - Sure. See you cut your hair. - Ah... I needed a change. - Looks nice. - I should go. - Sure. - Jamie?! It's me Charlotte. - Hey. I need to borrow your truck for a few days. - Can't do it. - One day then? - I've got too much work right now. What do you need it for anyway? Where you going? - Just to visit a friend. - Sorry J, I need every vehicle I got. Except maybe the Ford. You fix it up, it's yours. - Charlotte you're up! - Yeah. - You forgot your lunch! - Here. Let me take this. - Wave bye. - Bye! - Bye-bye! - Hey. - Hey! Hi! How are you? - Good. - How goes the job hunt? - Ah... not very well. - Well have you had any interviews? - Not yet. - How come? - I've never had a job before. - Can we have these? Please...! - Sure honey. - Well you know what? Next time, tell them that uh... If raising 5 kids doesn't teach you multi-tasking, you don't know what does. How would you feel about working here? - Um... - We've got a gal going on mat leave. I could talk to the manager. - Sure. - Okay. - Thank you. - You bet. Bye you guys. - Bye! - See ya. - In math class we learned about triangles, the hypotenuse. - The hypotenuse? - I could picture it. The triangles, everything made sense. That's so great. And guess what? I got a job today. - You did? - Mm hmm. At the grocery store. Sweet dreams. - Mom? I like school. - You going somewhere? - Just uh, fixing up my brothers truck. - Uh huh. Not planning a trip are you? - I was gonna tell you. I just wanted to bring her back myself. Charlotte, I just wanted to bring her back. I was gonna tell you though I swear. - You know a man who hopes to marry is usually eager to please the church Bishop. - Ya I know sir, I just, I wasn't thinking straight sir. I beg your forgiveness sir. - Do you see the gross error of your ways? - I do. - It was a grave offence. - Ya I know. - What am I gonna do about it? - Does coffee always make you feel this way? - Uh, it doesn't affect me anymore. - Really? - Ya I mean maybe at first but you know when my husband left I had to do everything and uh... I had to stay awake somehow. - My first husband and I divorced. Charlotte's father. - You can do that? - We didn't want to. We really loved each other but he was forced to leave. - Well what happened? - Well they said he was a non-believer. He believed in God, just not their God. They drove him out. And the next day I was sealed, married to father Josiah. - Oh God, that's awful. - And then a couple of years later, he... died... he... committed suicide. Honey, I am so sorry. - I don't think that I can drink anymore of this. I'm feeling a little queasy. - I'm surprised you haven't had caffeine before. - I did try a sip of Coke once. - You did? - Um hmm. - Surprised you're not behind bars. - Oh is that the school bus? - That's my husband! Call 911 and tell them that I have a restraining order. You guys stay with Louise okay? And under no circumstances do you guys come outside, okay? - Jamie! Jamie! - Don't come near them! - You are looking like a harlot already. They're my children. Snatched from their proper home. And these two... They wanna get married and I'm gonna see that that happens. - Charlotte, don't listen to him. Please! - I miss you, son. - Don't you go near him! - I want you where you should be. In the Priesthood. - You can't do this. - Oh Alice, I miss you when you sing. The devil... He paints a smile on his face, Alice. It's just like you and me. You get Satan involved in my business. He will come back to you. - Josiah Leavitt? - That's him. We're here to enforce a restraining order. - Now hold on. Just hold on officer and save your breath. My girl here and my boy, they just wanna come home, that's all. - Sir you need to step away. You are not permitted to come within 500 yards of these children. - Oh. Whoa, now Charlotte's not a child. She's 16 years old. Aren't you sweetheart? She can go where she wants. I know that much about the law. - No she can't! - I want to go! - She's old enough to make her own decisions. Grab your things. I'm sorry son. Now these men can't mind their own business. They gotta get into ours. Well let's wait in the truck. Now... you and me... We're not done. - Come on, let's go. Charlotte, you're making a big mistake. - No, I'm not! - Father Josiah doesn't keep his word. - And you do? - What does that mean? - You can't keep me here forever. I'm gonna marry Jamie. - He won't let it happen. Oh. - Miss Joseph. I truly am sorry. Now look, your husband he knows where you are now, so we're gonna have to find you a new place to live. Alright? - Come on in you guys. Make yourselves at home. - It's okay. - Don't be shy. Come on in. - Come on, Kate. Sweetheart, it's okay. - Okay, so why don't you guys throw your stuff in the living room over there and then we'll figure out where you're gonna sleep. Okay? - We won't be staying long. Social services will find us a place. - Jude, stop it okay. Alright? This place is too big for me anyway. - Thank you. - Hey. How are they? - Oh, they were upset but they'll be fine. Should I make some coffee? - Oh honey. You don't wanna drink coffee at this hour. You'll be up all night. You don't have to do that. Please, just relax, okay? Make yourself comfortable. - You have a beautiful home. So many lovely things. - Oh thank you. Well I'm a... Thrift store Goddess. You did the only thing that you could've done. You know that, don't you? - I just wonder if I'll ever see her again. - Okay, you've gotten that down now let's say for example a customer doesn't want the chips. So what you're gonna do is hit delete on the register. Good, and then take the scanner and just, there you go, on the bar code, excellent. Okay Judith, you've gotta stop worrying about Kate and Michael. They're gonna be fine at daycare. They'll have a ton of fun and you're gonna see them at 5 o'clock. - I know, it's just Charlotte. - Honey, you couldn't dig a moat deep enough to keep that kid in. Alright. Good luck. You'll do great. - Hello. He's not here right now. Can I take a message? - Where are you? No don't tell me. I don't wanna have to lie. - How's Charlotte? You have to talk to her. - I will. - He's really angry at me. Who knows what could happen to her. - Can I help you? - I'm looking for a book on astronomy. - Astronomy is in the 520s. 520s. Dewey Decimal system. Millie, can you show her for me? - Mm hmm. All the books are numbered. You just have to look at the spine. I know where the astronomy ones are because I like astronomy too. Actually I have a telescope. - You have a telescope at home? - Mm hmm. You should come and see it. - Hey. - Oh hi! - How you holdin' up? - Fine. - Have you heard from him? - No. - I really wish I could go in there and get her for you. - But you can't. - No. - Have you always wanted to be a police officer? - Um yes I did. I... my dad was a cop. - I always wanted to be a teacher. - Well you know, there's still no reason why you couldn't be. I mean, you're really smart. You could go back to school. - I guess I could. - After what you've done it'd be a piece of cake. I mean look, you've got a whole new life and a new job. - I... should get back to work. - I said something. - No, no you didn't. I'm... I'm just not used to a man talking to me like this. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you. - No, you didn't. - Okay. If you need anything you let me know. Okay? - Mm hmm. - Have a nice day. - Don't we have homework? - Did it. - Math sucks. I wish we'd stayed in school. - Me too. I always thought that the stars were smaller than the moon. But they're not. - Really? - They're just further away. I can look at your homework with you if you want. - The Prophet will be here today then? - This afternoon. - And Charlotte? It's true about Jamie Coyle? - You're full of questions. - Oh, it's just I'm surprised. He's young. - He is young. Mmmm... I thought before breakfast we could... - I can't. I'm pregnant again. - Ah... Well done. Send the girl up then. - Yes. You would tell me if you were marrying her, wouldn't you, Thomas? - Yes. Of course I would. - So if not you... and if not Jamie Coyle. Who then? - You can't say a word to anyone. - I haven't looked at this dress in years... Shhh... - I'll take her. Your mother wore this dress. - She did? - Mm Hmmm. I bet she misses you. - I had to come back. Do you think I'll ever get to see her again? - Well that depends on Father Josiah. Charlotte. Never mind. You're gonna look beautiful. Go ahead and try it on. - Hello. - Judith, it's me. It's about Charlotte, the wedding. They're going to make Charlotte marry Father Josiah. - Sorry. Officer Amesbury isn't available. - When will he be in? - It's his day off. - I'd like to leave my number if that's okay. I will be back very soon. And you... Kate help your brother with his homework. - I'll take care of everybody. - Thanks, sweetheart. - Okay... How about you kids wait in the car for me. I'm gonna just talk to your mom for a second. Okay? They're so cute. Did you get a hold of Wayne? - It's his day off. - Oh, well did you get him paged? - No, they said they'd give him the message but even if I got a hold of him what would he do? - Judith, you can't go there by yourself. - I'll go by the local police when I get there. Louise, I'll be fine. - Okay... Look... Please be careful. Oh boy. - I'll be fine. - Okay. - Okay, let's get you monkeys to school. Buckle up! - Jamie, don't you know it's bad luck? - I don't believe in luck. - Did anyone see you come here? - Stop worrying. You look so beautiful. - Really? - I'm the luckiest guy in the world. - Except you don't believe in luck. I guess I better get home and get dressed. We'll see you in a couple hours... Mrs. Coyle. Did you talk to child services? - They can't help. We have the same problem here. What you folks call a marriage it isn't even a legal ceremony. It's like you're asking me to drive in there and break up a church BBQ. - Except that my 16 year-old daughter is being forced into a marriage. - Look if she comes to us then we can do something. It'll be too late. - I'm sorry, I am. Look... You shouldn't go back there. - Well if it's a church BBQ then there's nothing to worry about. - Wayne! I've been looking for you everywhere. - What's the problem? - It's Judith, she needs your help. - Ah my car's right over here. How far away are we? - Almost there. - Weddings are such joyous occasions. - Hey. Me and a couple of the other guys... we thought we'd drive you over. - I'm still gonna need a few minutes. - Sure I'll wait. - I got Charlotte's dress. - Oh, she's having a bath. - Actually I was hoping to help her dress. - I'll go with you. - I thought you said we were going to your father's house. - It's a little wedding day tradition. What, nobody told you about this? - So what's the tradition? - You think you're better than us? Think again. - You withheld information from Father Josiah, Bishop of the church. You disobeyed him. You come back, you know what'll happen? - There. You look fine. - Thank you. - She needs to know. - Know what? - You don't want her getting upset when she walks in there. - Tell me. - You're a lucky girl, Charlotte. You're going to marry your stepfather, the Bishop of the church. You're going to be the 9th wife of Father Leavitt. - I won't do it. I won't marry him. - Well there's nothing else for you. - Where's Jamie? - He's gone. He ran away. - He wouldn't do that. He loves me. - Father Leavitt is a powerful man. He could be the next Prophet. - I don't care. - Come here. - I won't go. I won't. - Keep sweet. Don't be like your mother. - I wish I was like my mother. - Well help me! - Just give her a minute. - Jamie wouldn't do that. He wouldn't. There she is. My beautiful girl. - She needs a little time. - Then why don't you let me have a moment alone with her? - Please don't go. - Now, now... A new bride, a new beginning. It seems you've gotten your house in order. - I have, sir. - Good. Good. I need you. The people need you. Ah, the bride. Sister Erleen, take Sister Charlotte's hand and place it in the hand of our brother Josiah. Fulfilling the law of Sara. Father Josiah, do you receive Sister Charlotte unto yourself to be your lawful wedded wife for time and all eternity in the new and everlasting Covenant? - Yes. - You can't go in there! Stop! - Let me go. - Grab her. - Let me go! Let me go! - Mother! - Let her go. - Now she came back of her own free will. You just couldn't mind your business. - Please just let her go! - Don't touch me! You're just a man, Josiah. You're not a God. You can't control these women and children. You don't own our children and you don't own me. Charlotte! - Jamie! - You're trespassing. - This young man has been assaulted. You wouldn't know anything about that would you? - I'll make sure whoever's responsible for this is punished. But right now I have to ask you to leave. - I can't do that sir. Not without Miss Joseph and her daughter. Seems she's being held here against her will. Local police are on their way. - You gonna drag her away with the police here? She's your wife. You failed to guide her. Let her go. No one is held here against their will. We choose to worship as we do. We choose our path of righteousness. We choose to live according to the holy doctrine of celestial marriage. - I'm so sorry. - Everything's gonna be just fine. Let's go home. - Once I turned away, I knew I'd never go back. But my sister and her children were still there. In that place where girls are traded and bred, married to men they didn't choose. A place that is so far from freedom. Closed Captioning by SETTE inc.
